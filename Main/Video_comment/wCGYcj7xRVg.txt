what i worry with procedural generation is that the tapes in level 0 will be ridiculous to find

I hate moths too but there is a pretty pink and yellow fuzzy moth called the Rosy Maple Moth which only exists on the east coast of Canada because they need maple trees as their food… wish we had them here in Alberta

i chek at google what the monsters at night they are like a litlle bit like a smiler but they have eys and when they cach you they open there mouth and eat you
🎉🎉🎉😊
Speaking of reusing items, Level 75: The Gallium Caves is a great place to reuse both the LIDAR Scanner and the Temperature Detector thing. How Level 88 works is that you are trapped in a cave made all of gallium. Each section can heat up or cool down. Since each section is made entirely of gallium, if you are stuck in a melting section, you will eventually drown in the melting gallium. Some parts of the level could also be too dark for a flashlight, and that's where the LIDAR scanner comes in.

In level 94 you can add flowers that poison you and you need to find water but the puddle of water might have hydrolitis plage and you have 10 seconds and in multi player you if you are poised you can give your friends the poison
The animated king looks like that but black 4:03
2:42 level ninety four found footage
Largef0rest85 is an idiot bruh, ITS A PC GAME!
Level ninety four found footage three 💀
Ikm
Add 0.1 and 0.2 and 0.M
Do it
I don’t play this, but I want level 58 which is a indoor water park
So a fix would to have the class risks apply in game, because level 5 IS SO MUCH HARDER and time consuming then level 188. 188 only has 2 entities and 2 layers, but level 5 has 3 layers and 3 entities but the layers are longer and the entities are harder despite level 188 having a higher class rank. (this is one example, and this is just a suggestion)
I love playing this game so much❤ I was playing this game with Gabriella and we named the wretches Billy and the hound Beatrix
That ain’t the hotel that titanic!
Bros went into a Abomination 💀
For the animated king in the next update, it looks like a stone statue  wielding a sword, he can turn you into an animation, and whatever you say he is, he becomes.
When are you going to make it so that people with phones can play it

Bro level 6 was a bitch lol. It was so hard to find the way out. For me though, I think the hardest level was level 9 (darkened suburbs). The wretch kept getting me and my buddy since he can open doors that dont have locks and he just speed walks at you as soon as he sees/hears you.
You know level 1 what is like the starting of the back rooms what does entities button level zero the there is no entities
First comment since last year
escape  the bakrooms  roblos
Bro add entity 666 in level the end please
Level 94 is my favorite
I'm on a iPad
The opponents look cool
I know it’s easier to make the Animations just Wooden Puppets but for the authentic Backrooms experience you should also have Animations made of plastic and clay also I believe there is a similarity among all Animations which lets you know they are the same “Species” and it’s their choppy stop motion movement also Robo-Men who guard the Castle and last also you should give the Animation King a crown otherwise he’s just some clown
Pls add apple support
If this is in steam im definitely gonna play it.
3:32 made me laugh
Ad it to vr now😂😂
Wretches nah bacon strips
Seed 69 🗿

If I had too make an entity it would be called a normal wall and it would be at level 0 and you would have to look at the wall and if it’s in a diffrent pattern then don’t get in its sight or else it would just throw itself at you

I just love that the backrooms put some of the HARDEST LEVELS AT THE START
I got jump, scared by that truck that came down on the screen lol
How do I get the update
8:54 “I still have TONS of plans for this game like adding even more official levels”  these levels haven’t been official this whole time?
I'm making a procedural world generator for the backrooms in minecraft. I definitely came up with some great methods for this. very good performance and a good distribution of big and small rooms with all kinds of weird shapes. I've been working on this for 2 and a half years now. it's getting closer to finished. if you use anything I made, credit would be appreciated. it's called pxnBackrooms. there is a lite version which only has level 0 and the code is much simpler. the full plugin has 14 different levels at the moment (not including sublevels) and I have another 25 levels planned. it has been a fun project.
So you are the creator of the backrooms
Game name
I Love The Start He Just Fell Straight In
where da hell our content at the game has not been updated in over a year man we r waiting
Level -1. Class 2.  Level -1 is a presumably infinite hallway that has doors on either side. The Level consists of white-painted walls and numerous black doors. Each door leads to either level -2, level 0, The whiteout or Level 2. Whilst inside this Level, one will no longer hear the hum-buzz of Level 0. Instead, one may hear slight piano noises in the distance; the source of the sound is unknown. The deeper one traverses through this Level, the slightly louder it gets, but it never seems to get any closer. Your vision seems to get more static-like effects while walking too far down the hall. During this time, you can hear some old advertisements from around the 1930's era through the static noise. Soon, your vision becomes black and white with the static effect. While this event plays out, you can see people in old business suits, although their human features are completely invisible to the human eye, the only thing visible is their attire. You may also hear the chatter of many beings mixed with the sounds previously mentioned. Almond water puddles can also be found on the floor during this event, dripping from the ceiling.  Credit to the backrooms wiki page.  Also IMPORTANT don't over work yourself I've realised most developers get something named burnout its where you get too stressed to do Anything. So I recommend to take a break after maybe like 2 updates although its up to you.
This man has a level of dedication not even the 9 Billion levels of me could match.

If you slowly enter the moths hive and then crouch you can roam inside it freely and even go beyond and behind the pinkish meat and reach a wall
Fancy “wretches are this abomination” proceeds to show a picture of himself😂

Can you take level with every entity in the game and then after just make the entity so hard that the fact it’s impossible for some people I’ll pay you every second or every day I’m gonna give you $100 every day OK😊😅😅😅😅😅😅😅

Correction on Fancy: male deathmoths are not as agressive as female deathmoths because males can be befriended while females cannot

If you put some moods in your Backrooms game it will be more fun.
If you put some moods in your Backrooms game it will be more fun.
Hey bro, can you put some moods please.
I feel like horror games like this should also listen to microphone input to allow the entities to track a player by sound. Especially a game like this where the player is often panicked and screaming. At the very least it could get triggered by the character's 'Hello?' or 'Anybody in here?'
Please, don’t change the player model it’s perfect
good video
In level kitty house, you could find a gun and you should make it actually work
When did nobody like to me!
Hello Fancy, i know that ur problaly not gonna see this comment. But a barely room is when only 2 people barely fit in a room. So it's basically a small room.

You should make it that if a wretch kills you then another one spawns (makes playing with a noob really hard)
Did you know that LaurenZside played your game?!
Male deathmoths look cute ngl
the puppet not look good that look piece of shit
Make animations look more scary please and make the jump scare in level run for Your life ! Like more scary instead of just being the player just falling over
I feel like it would've made more sense for the animated king to be a puppet as well, just a really big one with a different model
You should make a level we’re like it’s like a level where it’s like build a level with the houses but it was later in the future so that all the houses are run down and abandoned
9
I don't like my own comments
Later on you should add random levels so you don’t go straight into the next big part. It’ll keep people guessing if they are gonna see lore
Him in space after the end of the world: Finally finished adding all 1.8446744e+19  levels
The entity in the castle is actualy just a normal king like a fairytale
I was eating McDonald’s right as he talked about level McDonald’s

You should change the entity’s model back but leave mr kitty as it was now it jump scared me 😢
Level 5 kind of sounds like a certain new Roblox horror game.                       pst here’s a hint it’s called doors
Bro, Plss add level 0.3 and 9.2 and 17 and 15 too
did you know that at nighttime on level 94, skin stealers, hounds, male death moths, smilers and death rats also spawn on level 94 at night? But the animations will kill them too. The animations will kill anything unless it's animated like them. The animations don't attack death rats because they can pretend to be animated themselves.
I want you to change the animation King to big puppet wearing a king hat.
day 1 of asking if you can ask you to add your game to ps4 and ps5
Add level -run for your life
One time a guy stayed outside for the whole night and didn't Die
If you can do it, make a better animation for the monsters, about the players just leave it like that, it's funny and a trademark, a better animation will bring more immersion to the game, I would really like it, and add more diversity for the maps, not just simple hallways, make a outside map, like a endless farm or a giant and empty city, please do this it would be good
You can tame male deathmoths with liquid pain.
hi can you make the game free for a little bc I have no money and I want the game :C
But i have a clown phobia

You forgot to add daisy bell (song) to level fun
Bro this guy was the reason I got into the backrooms I really hope your game goes well   From a happy partypooper
I think it could be fun if we were able to tame deathmoths with almond water  And also you could add a prank that sometimes you are able to interct with a hound using almond water and it would pretend to get tammed but than it just jumpscares you 😊
you should add the party poppers and the froners
1:36 male death moths aren’t actually really deadly there one of the only entities you can tame to become your friend maybe then you’ll finally have some friends😂
You should make all those big a moth like go away if you shine the bug spray
That's one of my favorite songs
bro are we not gonna talk about how he graphics are actually AAA. They literally looks **almost** like a 1 to 1 replica of real life
Male death moths are not dangerous the female ones are and you can tame them
Did you know that Death Moths can actually be tamed, if used almond water, when tamed it'll attack nearby entities and help you find exits, you should definitely
It is called the clap out it pops out of the floor to floors and and goes even faster increasing
I'm not sure man I think I seen I flying pig
Add slides please

No clipvr
The animated king is known to be a floating blue flash of light that can send you to the void by just eating you.
The truck scare me
I’m just saying you can’t leave the game like this you have to add the game to quest
u should make a bird that detects entitys and is found in leval  94 in a cage just a cute thought

3:33 Bro, I literally got jump scared by a truck, and it worked😂
cant you just tame male death moths?
Wait how to kill the new boss
Hey Fancy!, Next update you should make that whenever players lose their sanity they become wretches and try to kill the other players but if a person goes into another level they should turn back to normal.
People make more videos than you
Take more videos
Making mobile
But you can tame male death moths
That flying truck in level 94 💀💀💀💀💀
Do level you cheated
This video kane pixels level
Fancy, I love this video, and your channel, just, next time, don’t show us the gross moth.
In level Ohio there’s two zeros so make sure there’s like a huge alien in it has big feet you have to watch out there’s fires and make sure the ad to the alien to avoid big bodies of water. You can no clip through water so make that’s the exit.
Good job fancy😅 i cant even make a block modole
Bro this looks like noclip VR

Put level 52
You should add Level 15. That stuff will be Horrifying
let me work for you pls <3
keep up the good work :D
imaging that doll didnt realised that lamp is an human😂😂
Sub level smiles house
To be honest i like the the original Player Model. I makes it funny seeing your friends run with bad animations. I bought your game a few days ago and the Animation when you look up or down is the funniest
3:30 gave me a heartattack
Make it in mobile plssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss
2 20 я пытался самок мотылька убить твоим спреем!
I was rewatching and decided to download the game, I got to the level where the pig flies then it crashed and didnt save. Fix your game
hold on everyone like this so fancy can see it 1: please please add the YOU CHEATED room 2: in level 0, there is a button you can find but it's rare. if you press it, there is 50% chance to no clip back to reality, 50% chance to no clip into a dangerous level (i think level fun or RFYL)
Kratos falling meme😂
I loved the Update
6:41
You should probably add that you can download entity 666 (The HappyFiles Virus) Into computers in levels and then it comes for you 5 minutes later
Plz add level 17 plz plz plz plz plz
Omg nice update
Wait I though u could tame deathmoths
8:50 lol
Ssundee Played you're game and it was AWESOME to watch it!!
add console support
Can you make a ASUS Chromebook Version?
I have never been more pleased with a horror game. Obsessed with the backrooms so this is a dream come true. Can't wait to try out multi-player. Solo mission first go-around. I'm not usually a PC player so it's been a littleeeee hard, but I'm invested bro. Keep up your hard work! You're doing amazing!!!
Make is for mobile
did you know that all animations used to be humans but were turned to animations by the animated king so it would be cool that in multiplayer if someone dies, during the animated king's trail, they should turn into an animation and hunt for their teammates.
I downloaded escape the Backrooms and it has a chicken gun😢
Yo so i played and i just wanted to say: the way you programmed the low sanity effects is INSANE. The way we start to see smiler faces in pictures, in our teamates’ faces really makes it feel like we are slowly losing it
1:41 omg why does it have tits
Can you add mobile support
Day 5 of asking to put this game on mobel
Add the frowners since you have ZERO neutral entites the frowners are pretty cool search em up
wow cool also do the rainbow friends!
What's the game name?
Lol the guy who un subbed bc of him not saving and a pig flying Lol
Also when on the beams in level 0 you can look to the side and cheese it say possible you can make it so your camera auto moves forward
u can up hardware requarerments if the pcs explode
Lave run
The male deathmoth isn’t hostile it doesn’t attack but the female does
9:11 MMMMMMMMM good music
Whatt is the game name
Bro exactly when the killer moth got squished a bk ad went on
Level 5 (Horror Hotel) was the worst level in the game imo. It's just really boring and annoying to always hide from the skinstealer/hound and collect all the numbers.
ok but i think adding too much detail like roads in the map takes away the "liminal" feeling. Maybe you can work with someone who knows really well about the backrooms and liminal spaces. I think that will improve you game
U shoul add redrooms which present level 0 if u explore too much and it's 100tines  more scary then normal level 0
Make it procedurally generated but add more types of "rooms" that have notes, lore, etc
Lidar i love that game
I thought Fancy's dad left his son to get milk.
Can you make it so that the animated king takes the form of the enemy that killed you the most throughout the game and you need to find some objects related to the entity he transformed into (hound: flashlight, s.stealer an ID , deathmoth moth jelly, smiler some kind of light, etc.)
Were can u find dis game
aaw
I love how he doesn’t just make the game and record it but he makes animations to add to the video as well
Can it be on ps4
The flying truck scare me
Fancy I have Your game it looks so fun Hope it does well  !
Can u put on platforms like PS4 and Xbox
You make a mobile phone backgrounds
I like your videos dude
E
And is it on VR
What is your game called
Add food to McDonald
does it cost money???????
974
The comment “Dude I downloaded your game on my phone and got to the level where the pig flies” cracked me up 8:49
is it on ipad i want to play it😮
So basically the animated king will send the entities from alternate watch at me? And if yes I getting the hell out of there
#pennyforkevin
Do you know EddieVR so one of his friends named Kevin and he’s looking for a penny, can you add a penny in the game just for him?
Bb
you should change the puppets animation into low fps animation
can you kill a female dath moth with the bug spray
Plz add the kill for chainsaw plz Plz! Killing an entities is good for the chainsaw plz add it IN!!!!
He truck made me jump
FANCY ARE YOU ABOUT TO SEND A NEW VID BECAUSE I JUST SAW A DUDE PLAY YOUR GAME BUT IT HAS NEW THINGS
Dude please, map a controller.
MALE AND FEMALE ONES ARE NOT THE SAME YOU CAN TAME THE MALE JUST LIKE ME TAMING A WOLF IN MINECRAFT!!!!!!!!!😎    but the female are mean just like real life😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 THEY SPIT POISON😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 (no offense when I said females are mean just like real life.)
1:37 male deathmoths are only harmful when provoked and are scared of humans  Its the females that are hostile though and only females make moth jelly But your game still looks really well and i want to play it someday
Male deathmoths aren't generally aggresive but females are
Yo I’m eating some kfc rn this sh bussin
I think he should add entity “666” a cyber entity that tracks you around the internet and jumps out of the screen when it attacks you (basically a time limit on the computers) if you stay on the internet for too long it will kill you but the restrictions to the entity is that it can only kill players on the internet and not jump into reality  and chase you it just kill you on the computer not the ground
Men in the back to in mobile
You forgot aqualand
:-( :-( why did you have to do this to me you're going to have to fix your game because like mad face you have to make the things be painful girl girl I'm going to get revenge I will end you if you don't make that thing up before but by the way make different
Hi
bro can you make the game free (love your content keep doing what you love) -also can i be in the next video?-
well i know it's hard and i think not possible but can you make a mobile version?
You can tame male deathmoths with almond water
Hear me out level 3999 shouldnt be the only level. Add level game over or level you cheated and add level whiteout. Matter in fact add level red forest. Or level 11 at least or level 0ih0 or level D3troit or level 912 or level 99 or 999 or level 972 or 998 or level memories the backrooms museum. Something man this game got more potential than any other backrooms game on the market like if you do more i bet this will be released for game consoles.
With only 8 bullets.
If you gone add weapons then add a pistol at least sheesh.
But good job btw but it needs more improvement. If you gonna give us weapons at least let us use it against skin stealers. It makes the M.E.G. look soft asf.
That sounds dumb asf.
You just released this update and it dont make sense you have a chainsaw person chasing you in the last level but you can get a chainsaw yourself why cant you kill entities with it?
Can you at least add it mobile?
6:15
Whoever this largeFOrest85 Frick you Download the right game next time You shouldn't unsubscribe to his channel!!
Add X box support
can you ad a tazer to the game to stune the i ntidys
I just keep dying In your game
Make Animations absolutely terrifying. And yes im talking about both animations as entity and animations as movement animations.
Female death moth are as big as the wall but I think that’s reasonable size
Love the vids keep it up
Female death moths shoot acid from their mouths you forgot to add that
the clown is stolen, you just downloaded it bruh. im a dev
you added wretches but didn't turn people into them when they go insane
can you add the no clip feature :)
Are you the creator of this game?   Btw I cant even pass Level 0 always fall down to hole
The fact that female death moths are the only one who produce moth jelly
The Animated King is supposed to be a large glowing white orb. There are a few images that I found a while ago, he’s kinda a spiky, tall, glowing human shaped thing.
3:33 car jumpscare
Have the beast of level 5 in level 5 too!
If this is expanding infinitly, it will gradually become more and more unplayable because it gets too big
He makes the game look silly but when I play it, I crap my pants and can only play when talking to friends.😅
I would like if, you added lvl 0.8
Can you play this on mobile
8:11 now we know why our dads never came back and we have proof,the ones that come back escaped from the backrooms
the games look really fun, I thought… then I found the game maker here, and this guy makes so much fun best back rooms videos!
RIP 🪦
Add an evil horses❤
Using procedural generation is literally so true to how the backrooms would be since it's all random.
Add new characters please the hazmat guys are terrible get another model for your character
3:33 the player: lalalal what a nice day- holy jesus- The truck: say goodnight
You know the theory that the back rooms is a bunch of simulated like pre made areas that “the creators” can put into earth? What if “the creator” is just this guy and whenever you go into he back rooms they’re just playing his game lol
Pls add  the crafting pls and nukes
1:36 it is ADORABLE
I downloaded your game on my phone. And when I got to the level where the pig eats the cat, the game crashed. It didn't even save I had to restart from the beginning. Fix your Damn game!
I played the game and it its one of the best
Plase aid two consol
💩
We need vr =)
The dark lvl looks like lidar
I love how he adds like 30 extra animations for the vid just for the entertainment and its got me dying of laghter
bro when you gonna to fix problem with mic in Backrooms
this man is willing to put his soul into a game.
infinite hotel… seems like a different game with lots of rooms and doors…
How many more times you are going to say brand new entities?
Make the new entitie called houmiler. It is hound and smiler but mixed so it spawns at the EYE level.
Here's a tip: why constraint yourself to the OG Backrooms?  You could make up your own levels and entities! I made up some of my own, like Hands, Sludges, and the Giant.
real quick question can you add exploration  mode where you can have a look around without any entities that kill or bother you if you cant thats fine
Ngl the death moth model is kinda cute
Why does level 5 remind me of the titanic
Please, dear Fancy, add macOS support to the game! :( I am a fan of your game and I really like it. I have told many of my friends about this game, but unfortunately many of them cannot play it because they have macOS. I will be very grateful to you if you fulfill my dream and request and add the ability to play such a wonderful game with macOS.
What about level 37 poolrooms
Fun fact: The castle on level 94 isint actually floating its on a invisible hill
You died 1:19
Add Memory Juice man
Good work bro😁😁😁
Make another update with the last level of the backrooms,the bathrooms,remove the pee pee water,animations,remove moth jelly,level ! Sublevel,level zero Su levels,add red rooms,put the major exploration group room on level 1, and a lobby
How does the person pee
i need a kep inventory options
i need more level🙂🙂
fun fact moth in hindi means death soo I dont think you need to write it as female death or male death moths
Oh shit your videos are so goddamn good
Male deathmoth swarms should swarm lights
Played the game with my friends and geez, even if graphics aren't the main focus, they sure are for me cause the level is GORGEOUS (only if your on high or above graphic and outside, not saying the rest is ugly but it just doesn't compare to the outside). I thought the level design with the animation king and dots to light up your path were really clever too.
Very nice Video 😂👌
face reveal pls
SaM I'm sorry but do you think ur fancys mother bro? shut up
Male death moths are friendly and can be tamed actually females are dangerous
lvl 94 is like ohio fr
Can you add a a sync update
But only the females
Did you know you can tames a death moth just give it almond water
I really like this game
i hate clons
I like the movement of the batmoff  in the video. What happens if the heat goes up to the max
Add mobile sopprt even if it’s not very fun
epic
I can’t believe this dude hasn’t fixed the bug where the guns don’t work and you can’t unclog the toilet Also who names there game GunsAndToilets.4000?
WOW displaybarcode in Loburgrobox
Is it a better idea to add costumes in back room shops ?😂
Trust me I realized something why do you need guns in the game if you could just add and tasers
Can i know if you will add more levels in the future? I really want to play a backrooms game where there are a lot of levels and you can go in these levels in different ways. That would be so cool! Let me know
Is this on meta quest 2? What’s it called?
The truck scared the sh*t outta me
0:07 what
Suggestion: when the player dies, they should like rot overtime, kinda how it works in the tapes!
The almond water problem makes people say  IM INSANE I NEED ALMONDS I need almonds
Male death moths are very friendly but if you attack it, it will be hostile. Then a female is very hostile and you can’t tame it with almond water because it spits acid, you can also tame male death moths with almond water.
The deathmoths are kinda cute honestly
In really the king looks like this: is a black human with a black crown but it have no legs and it have hands
Bro can you tell me why he reminds me so much of Dani that programmer
2 minutes and 23 minutes made me laugh
You should replace the ladaf scanner with night vision goggles that show temperature. For example, your teammates can have red dots on them because they are human, and wretches can be blue.
Are use the level that is a neon arcade
you should add the saint marry/a ship to nowhere
mom said its my turn to play escape the backrooms
Are you going to ad mobile support?
Can you play it
the clown in multiplayer needs a rework. me and my friend played it, we stood near the cart, I look in front, my friend looked in back. the clown couldn't pose any threat

You should add crawling so you can crawl on the thin floor in the hole room at level 0 but not fall. But add a skin stealer in there that comes after you and if all people fall it comes down.

1:42 ayooo balls . Warning ⚠️ bug
"Promo sm" 💔
For Another vid:  Level kindergarten ( made up by me ) : You spawn in a kindergarten called' Manual padlocks ' and there are entities called ' funner cunner ' or ' immunity ' well, you have to hide in tables or outrun them ( which is hard) the exit is a red room where you have to run because a teacher monster called ' banbaleena ' which is from a game called garten of banban and you have to follow the arrows or you will take a dead end and in the end, she will get blocked and you have the exit ( you could noclip there if you check one the houses on level 98 or 99 or 97  and you find a hole and you go in it ).
👍
Also how do they drink or eat through the gas mask?
can you add level 212
He makes the best horror game. He is also hilarious throughout his videos
Umm... E
Add scps to the backrooms game or maybe add a way to get to the scp foundation where you could find information about the backrooms and stuff. And maybe get access to keycards to open doors in the backrooms. Maybe even add guns I’m not forcing you but just saying. Maybe add documents or add scp in the game. Suggestions on scps to add, scp 096 the shy guy, scp 173 the sculptor, scp 999 tickle monster, scp 106 the old man, scp 049, plague doctor., scp 035 the prossisive mask, scp 682 the hard to kill reptile, scp 939 the one with many voices, scp 3008 infinite ikea, scp 049 -2 zombies. For scp 999 do a heath boost or stamina boost when you feed them cookies energy bars or candy, scp 035 make them walk around as scientists or class-Ds and if killed by it, the mask will be on the hazmat suit, and can be killed by knifes. After a while the scp will fall down dead and become just the mask it’s self. Scp 3008 could be a new level that can be entered through the hub or the scp foundation. The lore is that the scp foundation started testing up with M.E.G to help contain the scps, and is researching and got abandoned due to a  containment breach and scps are now roaming around in the backrooms. And parts of the backrooms could have sectors were the scp foundation contains scps and is a way of finding scps, there is a large scp facility that has most of the scps, basically the idea is to make one big facility that has most of the dangerous scps, and there is little reaserch outpost here or there containing helpful scps or dangerous scps such as scp 500, can cure anything.
Add sips pls
I am sweating now cause of this game so dam scary Pls add the scp foundation
Make it for mobile it will make this game HUGE
A question, does your game have jump scares?

What do you know those like thingies in level zero yeah just wait and green version. And you already know the black one. The black one doesn’t best for the walls in the world. When does Blessed Food walls taxi tack in the green ones you already know well helps you.
Think you should make it if you drink too much on the water in the game you’re gonna blow up
ive got a cool idea instead of giving enemys health bars how about dismembering them until they cant attack you anymore

Boa noite Val

These dolls dont look to evil (NO HELP) oh wut the fu-

Add The Party Host Plsssssssss
Plz relise it on playstation
hmm, by the way, I read (why in early development) in the steam and in the end I read that you implement comments in the Discord and in YouTube and I decided and I know what you need to add. add other ways to the entrances to other levels because they, too, can then lead to the original levels deliberately add level -1 because it can lead you to any level almost, but better let them see to level 2,1,3 and if you reach the end of the corridor, you can go back to level 0 by the way, to get to level -1 you need either break the wall at level 0, or find a broken wall that looks at level -1, level -1 looks like gray corridors and by the way there are no entities there, but there your mind will go sooooooo fast, so if you don't stock up on mental water. And by the way, can you please remove the name of the liquid pain on ??? Russian Russian is just that we are essentially playing for a wanderer who got into the backstage and wants to get out of the way, but he does not know what kind of liquid pain is (liquid pain) because the REAL PAIN WAS CREATED BY the BACKSTAGE ITSELF and I also, if anything, am Russian so I write from a translator and pj add Russian to the game so that it is better to communicate in Russian Russian and add other languages to your game with friends, or random people, if they are Russian, well, add other languages, but if your game has already had Russian and other languages for a long time, then fine. and by the way, add level 790, so is he? well, yes, it is written in the description that a person dies instantly there, but do it so that there was not much on the turnover by the way, there are snowmen they move only when a person is not looking at him, but if ordinary snowmen they just stand there, what do not all snowmen have no matter what kind of faces they have terrible disfigured random in they rarely come in at home, but they melt there, almost often there is a snowstorm in which there is no chirta in sight, and at the same time it kills, and please add level 995, and on my comment I will finish at the level of 999 in my opinion I have almost done everything well, I think that's it.
Wait whats your game called. Is it just called the backrooms?
when updat?
Man Kratos Got No clipped by athena in the backrooms💀💀☠☠💀💀
just finished the entire levels the game as so far with my mate and i would like to say that its a pure masterclass! It introduced me to the backrooms lore wich i now love so thank you for this masterclass! cant wait to see the next updates
Can u make backroom as a app in IOS bc I really like the game so plz I want to play in my phone😮‍💨
Where's the updatee fancyyy pleaseeeeeeee
IM SAD BC IM BROKE
What are you planning to add in the next video?
That old skin should be an Easter egg of sorts lol
Calus Play You're new update
Level -1. Class 2.  Level -1 is a presumably infinite hallway that has doors on either side. The Level consists of white-painted walls and numerous black doors. Each door leads to either level -2, level 0, The whiteout or Level 2. Whilst inside this Level, one will no longer hear the hum-buzz of Level 0. Instead, one may hear slight piano noises in the distance; the source of the sound is unknown. The deeper one traverses through this Level, the slightly louder it gets, but it never seems to get any closer. Your vision seems to get more static-like effects while walking too far down the hall. During this time, you can hear some old advertisements from around the 1930's era through the static noise. Soon, your vision becomes black and white with the static effect. While this event plays out, you can see people in old business suits, although their human features are completely invisible to the human eye, the only thing visible is their attire. You may also hear the chatter of many beings mixed with the sounds previously mentioned. Almond water puddles can also be found on the floor during this event, dripping from the ceiling.  Credit to the backrooms wiki page.  Also IMPORTANT don't over work yourself I've realised most developers get something named burnout its where you get too stressed to do Anything. So I recommend to take a break after maybe like 2 updates although its up to you.
you are the most GENIUS person on earth dude
Also I like how you edit the videos you make so even though you're making a scary game seem so hilarious!
Just to tell you, if you add level 188 to your backrooms game, can you please follow the description from the fandom and not the wiki? The wiki changed the description of the level from a courtyard of windows too a planet of some sort (according to the YouTuber Broogli). So follow the description from the fandom and please add it, I'm begging!
Add level 117 please it’s a big math. Classroom an there’s two unique entities for it
Plz make a Mobile version
your game is amazing!
my guy ı did buy your game and ı like it, but there is some problems like if you bind something to t or y you cannot write itheardyou the computer password, and another bug is if ı just open player list and open my inventory it blinds me with my inventory, but other than that it's a great game
Hey Fancy! I love your game but the new look of the partygoers really ruins the vibe of Level Fun imo. Could you change it back please?
bro rlly risked his life no-clipping into the backrooms to make a game 💀
How er bout this when you lose sanity there is a 50% chance of turning insane and a 50% chance of turning into I wrench but you can still play as one of the wrenches
Make it free i just want to play it in THE END? Level please..
VR!? OH YEA NOCLIP IS GONNA BE 2ND PLACE!!!!
You said add a watery level like level seven or level 4000
What's the name of the your Game
Just remember to add it on quest2
make this game on xbox for me plllzzzzzz😢😢😢😢
You should make it so you are walking down a sidewalk then no clip and that’s how you go in
When I turn 6 come with the FBI and two to
I've played some good backrooms games here and there (best one I played before this one is Apeirophobia on Roblox) but I have never played such a good game and I'm hyped for the next update since I've already cleared this one and I bought the game not even 3 months ago
Please add sub levels to the levels
YO fancy if it is possible you should check out the game no clip vr it's a multiplayer game in VR and has 2 game modes and multiple levels I think if you reach out to the creator you and him could make an ultimate backrooms vr game or make your game quest compatible
i wish it was on mac
2:18
update or will be your surviving family members to update
Pls add level 666
I personally think you could add a gun, but it doesn’t kill them. It only stands on for a short period of time and you can really only do it if you’re about to get killed, and you only have a limited ammo.
My favorite youtuber played this
I know your now adding it to V.R. at some point so can you also add it to mac. A lot of people play video games on mac and use steam except like 90% of the games are only for windows. So please try to make it support mac players.
You should add insanities when you do of insanity
fancy should add level 11. Also known as the endless city. It is a class 1 safe level and like 94 it has a day and night cycle. but has no entities. so you probably wouldn't add the day and night cycle. The good thing about level 11 is that it is full of Almond Water. The way to escape this level is by jumping down a manhole. the way to enter this level is by following the dirt path on level 10. So if you decide to also add level 10 to your game that could be the way to level 11. Or you could make a more interesting entrance to level 11. If you add this level to your game your awesome! 😀😀😀 😀😀😀😀 Also your game is super fun and I can't wait till you add the roller rink. I saw it on your discover server.
3:31 my body took a screenshot
dude please, make your game free, day 108 of saying that
dude please,make your game free, day 64 of saying that

Where new video?)
Add the military base
Fancy it doesn't make sense for the characters to be hazmat suits if we "nocliped" we should have city clothes
D4 of trying to get leve 702
Hey, I was thinking on you, adding it to consul in a few months or something I don’t know because I really want to play this game and I’m stuck with an Xbox and I can’t get my PC anytime soon, so can you just please add to consoles PlayStation and Xbox. Maybe Nintendo I don’t know just do it please
I clicked the play button and it did’t let unless I need a pc
I did’t let me play it
Level 5 is doors 0:44
why does your game need money
Honestly i bought the game, it was worth, every, cent. such a good game! Cant wait till update 3
Please put this on console (specifically Xbox)🙏🙏🙏
Please keep making this game, this game is now one of my favorites. My friend recommended it to me, and I to the others, and now we play together, it's a very cool and well-developed game! We are waiting for new levels!
After this game is VR supported, you should think about adding it to the quest store
Please please please please
Please
Can you make a farm room
theres a game already out the name is noclip vr
Idk if anybody realized this but at 8:54 he shows a blurred image of a normal neighborhood so is this a teaser for level 9?
Love ur game bro i have a few ideas btw
WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO UPLOAD ITS BEEN 2 MONTHS PLEASE UPLOAD
updateeeee pls
The game is fire, we should extinguish it🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
😢
My account name is emanstraight1
I downloaded the game but I can’t play it can I have my money back please
Honestly the level with the hounds needs a rework I'm on normal mode and they teleport and go through shut doors. and there's about 1 of them per room, not fair
Fancy pls keep posting
bro you should put vr headsets on the player if they are on vr so its like a cosmetic
eddievr played this game
and tab
bruh how about ipad
Wish it was a little longer I bought me and my friends this game we beat it in like a total of like 2 to 4 hours but good game and glad I got it in its earlier version
Make it VR Support!!!!
I don't  Have money to buy ur game but can u add smoke bombs around the map and make them rare or common cause if you use a smoke bomb you can escape the entity without getting in trouble also make it that if u get out of the smoke bomb range a bit of smoke follows you for 4 seconds
Jelly play the backroom
I don’t have discord but you should add a thing where you can contain *SOME* entities like the death moth (male ones only) with almond water
It's so cool watching this project grow and evolve in real time normally I show up to these things too late and it's all already happened I'm looking forward to seeing future updates
Add fire salt witch can burn entities and have that entity disappear for 1 minute
Add lucky o milk plz
Plz make level 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 and 14
I have some suggestions for the LIDAR scanner it'd be cool if you made it more likes gmod's LIDAR mod or like this game scanner sombre. They have things like bst scans and being able to change the radius of the beam. And another thing is that they have monsters but they only just cast a outline on the wall. It'd be cool to get rid of the screen that lets you see the wretches and instead rely on only sound. And the only way to see how the wretches move in real time is to constantly scan it. Thank you if you add this!
CAN YOU PLEASE MAKE THE GAME MOBILE TO
Dude I downloaded you're game and I got to the level with the big giant huggy wuggy? and it crashed AND ITS REALLY LOW QUALITY I'm unsubscribing this game is horrible.
Ayo VR Support When?

Looking forward to new things as always, seem like all the Backroom stuff is adding to games as a open-world / no-clipping dreamscape an such, amazing amazing <3 Hope to see those camps/settlements of real npcs who can tell vaguely about their places... etc c: <3 Hopefully one can MAYBE reach those <3
Can you add the ability to tame certain entity's because it is cannon
You added level 7 thalassphobia really you didn't tell us also are you gonna level 10 field of wheat

Pls add on ps4
Bro    can     you    poot    levul   1000000000
Is it on Xbox?
You don’t have to use prosegle generation. It’s fine the way the game is. Also a suggestion. The players are separated when they spawn in level 0. Do you think you should make it so they spawn together like in the other levels? Ok the real suggestion. There are more entities in level !. There are Smilers, Partygoers, Hounds, Clumps, maybe Skinstealers. There are more entities then just these.
Its been TWO MONTHS WHERE IS A NEW UPDATE
And did you make the level with the boat and water
YOU HAVE TO UPDATE AND MAKE THE NEW LVELS PLEASE I WANNA SEE IT SO BAD
You should add the Pyrochelicera, the 12 meter long reptilian creatures that resemble caimans
Could you please make new update I am begging you 🥺🙏

ISTG I WANT THIS GAME SO BAD. EVEN THOUGH ITS VERY CHEAP 10$ XD
The best game in world
This is so awesome, and I do really hope at some point it will come have vr support that could Mabye work on a quest 2
Im inlove with this game
hi Fancy when I bought the game it worked perfectly but now I can’t play multiplayer there are not any servers can you help me please?❤
Could there potentially be a mode/option to turn entities off? Been looking for a liminal space/backrooms game thats set up for exploration.
Pls add gun that spawn randomly And gun has no ammo   -mp5 -m4a1 -m9 -ump45 -g3 -ar15
Can you make level 7?
I love this game and it terrifies me. And when you add vr support I am going to have a panic attack and die
You said level 5 it’s level 15
Ladies and Gentlemen, do NOT join the discord server.

Hey btw you can canonically tame male deathmoths if u give them almond water so maybe if you tame them you can pet them to increase your sanity
Yes
he's already done so much on his own i can only imagine what this game would become with an entire developer team.
When is the new video coming out?
Make there be multiple exits that lead to different levels. The basic path, which follows the number system as much as it can, then another path that can lead to other levels. Also make wretches hear you move because rn they are a non threat
make a vr port pls
I like your work. 8€ for so much stuff. No way to complain.
PEACE!!!!!!!!!

This game is really fun, got it for my friend and one other we had a great time on it. Some levels are too hard such as the hotel level before the boiler room, but otherwise good! If the levels could be balanced around their class in the wiki that would be really awesome
Hey dude you said you added mr kitten level but in people's play thought it wasn't their
Please add this game to Xbox

Yo who wants fancy to make level 702 the jungle plus the ear feature would damage  √the player like if so
Cn you add this game on mobile and more pls!
3:30 (wow cool number) me playing meme attack on roblox:
fancy do not forget about game modes
Yes, I understand everything between the two of us Fancy games are created by backrooms don't get it right, I want when I went to school I could unlock the phone, click on the application called "Escape the backrooms" and play it no, I need to wait for fucking lessons and GO TO MY COMPUTER TO GO TO THE GAME THAT IS ON THE COMPUTER AND NOT ON THE PHONE, I want you to please add phone support, I want the game to be in my phone.
I got to the toilet in the hotel and checked both (men and women) and in the man there were male moths (idk if he coded this or it’s coincidence but still cool)
Can you make a new video of the back rooms game
Can you make tasks mode where there is a man with a hazmat suit giving you tasks like escorting the survivor or finding the dead entity for extracting its information and dont forget add a m14
Hands down the best backrooms developer so far.
really need  1.  The possibility  going to different levels from one level by various means (no clipping/interacting with a flickering light/ jumping into a painting/ interacting with an object) 2. The Infinite Library (check out Quill's Channel) 3. The Promised Land (same) 4. The Party Poopers (same) 5. Play Palace (could probably collaborate with the ytber Lost in Hyperspace") 6. Kitty's House (same)
will u add party host to your game?
when you make new video dude?
Suggestion: add neon water 💦
IMAGINE PITFALLS IN VR BRO IT WOULD BE SO PAINFUL AND U HAVE TO DEAL WITH MOTION SICKNESS BECAUSE OF THE MECHANICS ON BALANCING
I wonder what the size of a kid to a size of a entity 🤔
Yo my man, just played the whole game, and the only things I'd recommend is always having flashlight and nerfing the sanity, but the game is awesome and I love you
Where did kitty go 😭😭😭😭 and where is the next episode 🥲
Pls add level uhh i kind of. Forgot the number it is level titanic pls
It’s been a month where is part 3
Can you add xbox Support plsssss
Pls add mobile
I have a bit of feedback for your game. The best part of it is that you can play with friends but if you don't finish the game when playing multiplayer then all of your progress is lost. Could you maybe create some sort of safe files or checkpoints for multiplayer?
Something I’d to see implemented is some kind of base building system. Even if it’s just basic to start.
Fun fact the  Backrooms is real but you can’t get glitched but you can get small things in the Backrooms
when you add vr support what headset will it be on
Fancy upload a new video
Where is kittys room
Escape the backrooms has become one of my favorite horror games. I'm excited for what happens next
this game is cool but a dont really like the new partygoer thay didn't look that good befor but thay look kinda sad now to be honest
CAN YOU PLS PLS PLZZZZZZZZZZZZZ MAKE THE GAME FREE I CANT BUY IT
Bro where is new update
A suggestion : you could make a smart entity, which instead of running directly at you while screaming when it sees you, tries to remain silent and attack you by surprise. I think that would be terrifying to be hunt by a predator as smart or smarter than you!
yo fancy i know that right now youre working on your amazing backrooms game but i like fps games and i would really appreaciate if you could do 2 final videos on your multiplayer fps
level 69
level 7
Mobile????
Your game is one of the best horror games i played so far, it's been so long since i got scared and had fun with friends in a game like that. I recently finished it and maaan i wish u can add more levels or another game like it. Keep going king 🤴

If this game doesn’t kill you with. A heart attack then it will kill you by making your pc go kaboom
I suggest that one of your new levels are level 188, courtyard of windows. It would work really well in your game.
When will next update release?

The male deathmoths are not hostile

?6
You should add a little separate mode that’s kinda like multiplayer but if you die you turn into a monster (idk if it’s already there just add it tho)
Will this game get VR support? That would be dope!!!
You should put Level 389 "The gaming hall." and the entity "The Gamemaster." and ill play your game
I really  love ur work.  But can I ask a question? This game have secrets in close places where people  can't go? And how long is Infiniti tower  ? I go up like 1 hour 🤣
As beginner who wanna play with random guy is very frustating to not have any RNG, because 2/3 of players just speedrunning levels so absolutely not interesting compared to the quality of the game
Did you know there was an entity that protects you but you need almond water you can make a army 🪖
I LOVE SCARY😍
I will unsubscribe if you don't make it
This game would be sick on Xbox and ps ngl
Can you play it on android???
nvm its 14.50$
i forgot is that free or not because idk wait no BECAUSE YES
I wish you could add an arcade mode with a gamemode called room defense with a crafting technique to craft guns and spray against moths
Do you have help, or do you just do it all, even edit your own videos?
How about adding the entities of hound and death moth in level !
i saw tfg play this
Can you please make levels and make easy mode and normal mode and hard mode and the back rooms mode the back rooms mode is very impossible
Also what is almond water
Add a hidden a true ending where you discover a door that leads to Joey drew studios And basically you get hunted down by the incognito and the projacksonist and you must destroy the projection as as he consumes the power of the end wheel and becomes unstoppable And combines with the entity figure and in the end they battle each other on top of the income machine before the factory blows up and The place Burns to the ground because of the ink and you run from seek
i will unsubscribe for making the game not free, even it so high file :(
But you can give link
Um when is next update 😅😅😅
Plis mobile
I was just wondering if you can make this game console supported. I have a Microsoft computer to play small games and an Xbox to play bigger games and this game will be huge at this rate and I can’t play it. I think it would benefit you and the console players like me. It would bring more players to your game.  The Microsoft does have steam on it but I don’t think that it will be able to hold a game with that size
I BOUGHT THE GAME!!!!!! I should play it on XBOX videos.
Bro what is the image of the game
I have no pc please make this game mobile version
What intro music?
Make the game free please
Sigma
Not sure why but whenever I play the game my gpu usage goes too 100 and it gets really hot
Can be free some days 😉
What do the burgers from McDonald's do if you ever manage to get your hands on them?
You should make crafting to make make weapons like bows axes , spears,clubs
Dude, I love your game, and it’s sooooo scary. I literally shut off my stream after dying the first time. I couldn’t do it.
I just played this game for the first time and Level 6 nearly made me tear my own hair out with how confused and lost I was
Everything looks fire so it's hard to ask to add anything  but I feel maybe upgrade the skin stealers to not immediately be trying to kill from across the map unless you get too close to them or make it to where they only reveal themselves as fakes when you shine the badge at them because they don't have one  Maybe you could do both  they just seldom seem like they are trying to trick people
And fancy , also i dont like the dark in the animated kind part of level 94 so can you add flashlights near the animated kind part
Fancy , theres this glitch for me and my friends server and when i get the moth jelly it falls through the ground
Give the animations a 12s frame rate like in spider-verse or, well… old animations
WHEN IS THE NEXT UPDATE
suggestion 1: make make death moths the size of female death moths but passive-aggressive. suggestion 2: make the partygoers look like an 8th grader's drawing suggestion 3: make level 7 suggestion 4: read the other suggestions suggestion 5: make tags on the suites
Also, I beat this game and it is amazing, I love replaying it too
I dare you to make a shining themed Easter egg level where you lose sanity in a certain hotel room of the hotel level to access
How come he hasn’t uploaded in a month
fallin worlds🗺
Can you add this to Xbox
The animation king  like it its like the same thing but its black and its got glitches on the sides
Is this in vr?
Change the character so it’s not a hazmat because it’s weird for someone who works researching the backs to not know where they are so change it. Ad a name tag on your character like the ones that you see on restaurant workers. That would make more sense
man put a system to distract the entities in levels as in backrooms it will be also a helpful feature to help [ like the electric rooms one for dog but put it in very few amount for specific level ]
the moths look fluffy and cute for some reason
can you add level RUN FOR YOUR LIFE
Can it be played by moble
Hey, so quick question what would u say is a age rating for this game?
Bro I need more Content :DDDD This game is one of the best games I´ve ever played bro but we need more levels :D
There are a few bugs with your game. I’ve noticed that there’s a bug on nightmare mode where you get the death screen everytime you enter a new level. There’s also bugs with items like almond water and flashlights floating inside cabinets and also when using the chat function you can actually end up bugging out the camera so that the camera is no longer placed where your characters head is. One of the worst bugs I’ve seen that only seems to occur in nightmare mode is that the hounds will ignore your flashlight and just kill you anyway which isn’t what they usually do
So as a backrooms fan i came to say my favorite. Now i have played this and i have some very good idea's Because my idea come's to level ! Which it would be  a big hallway but with random object everywhere. But to make it harder, You would have to pay attention to different  doors cause random entity's  spawn from them and the exit door would bring you to a random level Or the hub
Make a mobile version
I really want this man to make a anti cheat so when it detects a cheater a skin stealers will appear and start running at the cheater at full forces. I want the skin stealer to get faster each second so 1 second it moves like a snail but 1 hour it moves like angry munchi. I also want it to chase the cheater in every lvl. It will be so fun to see a hacker get surprised by that skin stealer also name it Dave
I amazed as to how great you are about making this game and I'm hyped to see more
Can you update level zero because I watch a video that says if you go the same way you go a different area than where you were and if you go not the same way you go the same area that you were at
pls add level 8,9,10 and 11
I think the levels are too lineal, there would be better if there was like different entrances to every level, it would make an own random experience for everyone instead of like a puzzle-themed horror game. Also make the levels bigger and more random, like it is not always the same. But apart of that the game itself  looks pretty clean and enjoyable, well done!
He needs to ma’e level 9 the suburbs I That seems like it would be cool
I really enjoy playing this game w my friends… real backroom’s game 😍🫶🏻😱😱
can u add replay mode so u can see wat happend?
please do more updates
Can you make Kitty's house plz
@Largef0rest85 man u played the wrong thing
I beg you add Ken block and Paul walkers cars into the game as a tribute to them - guy from the car community
Make the animated king spawn animations
Fun fact: did you know that you can actually take male death moths with almond water
1:45 Bruh
WHY  THAT SAY  FANCYS DAD
First of all, I love your game. U put a lot of effort into something really amazing. The style is perfect, the game is fun and challenging and u get to experience it with friends   But I might have a small request if possible  The game appears to be extremely demanding, even on high class pc I know your models nd texture are amazing, but it feels like the game isn't yet optimised at its fullest.  Thank you very much!!
I'm there?
NPC wave* *squeaker voice* hi! 👋
the poolrooms is just unsafe level
Love this game! Honestly scared tf out of me!
0:03
I have an idea for ur game (which u prob wont read) but it’s a level called  “kittys room” (lvl 974, a real level)and you can stay there until you exit, and if you don’t exit in less than 40 minutes then you die, what you have to do is while kitty stares and you forever you have to look survive on almond water and if you have less than 40% sanity somehow you’ll die, and the way to escape is when it’s nighttime you can find a key, only during the night, and the key opens a closet door which would lead you out, I recommend reading fandom bc wikidot gives cancer, anyways This isn’t the real thing you have to do in level 974, this is a whole different thing. Creativity
Hey I’m a person who loves horror and I would love it if you tried to put the game. On vr oculus because I like the game that you have created.

Hi @Fancy how are you, your game escape the backrooms is totally awsome, you must create the level "you cheated" this level is the most dangerous level of the backrooms, the game needs an anticheats players and level "you cheated"is a perfect level for players who cheating, hacking and speedrun.

1:48 💀 Edit: 2:21 💀 Edit 2: 4:30 💀
You can create levels and entities that are not part of the backroms lore and out it apart of the normal mode  Like a custom levels mode or a postgame/extras levels  An exemple you can make a level that is a water slide and you have to go through the slide trying to not get hit with objects while a cocodrile entity try kill you  (Just an idea )
hey bro can u make this game for mac pls im realy sad i cant play this
I think the models look too basic change the avatar ?
is there a chance that you are able to make the party room harder. the ending with balloons should be the old end where you had to rely on your friends to make it under the tables.
This game is amazing
Can you make a mobile port when you can? It would be fun for people who don't have a computer.
aa mabe you kan pot voice chat in your game

Your amazing😂
Can you please change the death affect it looks too cartoony😅
It would be really funny if you allowed us to hunt them for sport... yeah
you should add mod support :c
I think you made a mistake adding roads and stuff to level 94. The whole point of the back rooms is to feel mysterious, scary, and even nostalgic. I feel like adding roads and other junk ruins the main perspective of the game. Hope you read this, since I don’t have discord.  From, a big fan
Make more updates please
The Early game access promises are… quite grand. But I really do hope to see this grow further!
We got ourselves a new Dani
Bro where you at you gone man

Ur making a great game and i am looking forward to the new levels

I wish one day, we will see non fully adventure/survival game, but survival/sandbox-like game that verse should be it.
I like of how every thumbnail is the same just with a different background
Can you make the level of playroom and poolroom.
Let's all enjoy the fact that there is always a guy holding his hand out in the thumbnails.
Level zero looks too empty add some random furniture around the map
I will do anything to buy this game
Put this on everyone's phone
Also add lawful 8 Ana level 10 And level 9
Because it's not fair of the people that don't have a computer
You need to put all of this on  Everyone's phone
Is the game mobile and if not can you (if possible) make it mobile
7:22
Hey you can add the modification of buttons to move because it's such a shame not to be able to play it because of that
Plz add the partypoopers
When is the new update ._.

Oh man, I recently finished this game with my friend and I absolutely love it, this game is really a masterpiece. I can't wait for new update to release!

Gawd i hope he keeps adding levels, so much potential 👍👍👍
hey not to be rude but Male death moths are actually docile and friendly, plus if you feed it almond water it could a be a companion, so maybe put that in.
I wanted to ask if you can make a console version like for ps5
i am so glad to know I have paid for this game, since you put so much effort and love into your game. Also the videos are so well made. Thank you
Kratos? What happened??💀
Will this game exit for android?
You should add Level🗿

Add no name tags but add different color suits so if the skin stealer seals, one of the different suits will become that suit
Bro desinc broke your game
just a level recomendation, could you add level 8 (Cave System) into escape the backrooms? it seems like it would be a cool level for a co-op game.
Will you add? A mobile version of the game 🤔
you should make this game available to vr i would love to play this game on vr
when u add vr support my house is gonna be flooded with pee
HOLY YOU GOT 11K SUBS AND IT ONLY TOOK 10 HOURS!!!😭

I'm having a problem. When I try to join my friend's game the game crashes. We are stuck on the hotel level because of that.
Can you lower your price for Escape The Backrooms because my dad won't let me get it if it's not something like 5 bucks
Can’t wait for VR support.😊❤
pls add that i can play on macbook pls
Station level is so bugged. Me and a friend cant even get past it. Since he died It just crashes his game everytime while its loading. You need to bring the option back to choose to play certain completed levels because now we have to start the whole damn game all over again and hope he doesnt die this time!
You need to make it so when they die they burst into confetti or something for a YouTube friendly mode
Mac or Linux support might be appricietaded, altough i do understand it might be a lot of work
Can you add level 282 I think it a nice concept
Level 5 is basically doors
Will you make it controller compatible soon. The key board gives me carpal tunnel. So controller would make it fun
bro pls make it free i don't have doller im in mongolia

I have A REALLY BIG question. Could you make granny as realistic as possible and playable. I have always wanted to see it look realistic.
This game will be epic on vr
voice chat is glitched no one can hear me and i cant hear anyone
this update was way better than the last, cant wait for more updates!!
I have an idea for ur game y don't you just add an entity who is a person who has been in the backrooms for too long and has gone mad . So he kills whatever he sees thinking that the player is the reason for his madness . And u just have to run when u see him and  Rarely he will have a knife  It can be any persons name but my idea name Is the 'The MAD Man this shall also be the level name and the map is the OG backrooms with the moist carpets,the yellow walls,and the flickering lights with the mad man and the og monster
add level 587
Please….don’t add procedural generation so I can rerember the lay out like I did in level 0
It would be nice for the smilers to have a physical form and a humanoid figure with tall legs on all fours like they are canonically.
Add gigachad
Please make it vr supported 😢
Also fancy I hope your game gets popular
Fancy add a giant worm looking through the window at the office level as a secret 🪱🪱🪱🪱🪱🪱🪱
If you make this game so that it feels like these Backrooms "Found Footage" Videos, then it would be really cool!

We need more lvs to the backrooms I'm having fun
I wish I could play this game but I can't
Can you also add a mode where it’s endless and when someone presses the “stop” button if they wanna stop, but to make it more fun. Add a lot of levels like 69, 420, 99207, 18. All that, just giving you an idea. 😊
Всем здорова с вами ходили бродилки
Can you add level from roblox doors
Dude the Lidar was easy but super fun, I loved the concept and I’m glad you’re one of the few to utilize it well
Please make the fan made level 0H!O if looks INSANE but ITS HUGE just consider it please
Your game is impressive, I was wondering if and how my basic and limited lore on the backrooms could help players. I'd love to see levels like 0.1, 0.888, -1, -2, -4 and, !-!, negative !-! to see how people react to ending up in them. **Chuckles**
And entity 30. Mother
Will you add level 1.5¿

Amanda

subscribed for vr support!!!!!
Yo you should add level 3999 it’s one of the ways to exit the Backrooms also it’s an arcade
Hey fancy, I'm pretty sure I remember you saying in the previous video you were talking about making a new player model because your current one isn't gonna cut it for the full release. I think you should do that but also make it so we are awarded with cosmetics for beating levels even if they are small like a party hat for beating level fun or drippy shoes for beating level run for your life. Please consider it and thank you for taking time out of your day to read this.
What if you also make it for mobile that will be the best
make game free
Are you going  to add this game to console
ayo fancy, please, add cassete saving on the end on easy mode
Please leave the character model as it is, for the memes it's just iconic at least for me
This is the most underrated creator I’ve seen
this game is actually so amazing. the levels in this game are very well made and optimized very well, like VERY well. i remember the game being beatable in around 20 mins, which was rlly a let down, but i underestimated the dedication fancy has put in, and it turned out to be amazing. took me around 2 hours to beat. we are ready to see so much more!!
I love the backrooms
Fancy pls make a new video
vr support????
remember me
You should add The Beast Of Level 5 to Level 5

Please fix the level with darkness, it is very difficult to pass. Change the lidar at least, it's very inconvenient.
Just make the levels in order because you're just lazy
Mr Kitty when???
Best creator in the world
When are you going add real no clipping to another lvl?
If you haven’t u could try to add it on every device.
This guy should make Hotline Miami with Modern Graphics
I love your videos
I have a recommendation of levels to add in full version. Like level 12, it is said that level 12 is a labyrinth of whit rooms. And the way you could exit is by using the clock, and you could turn the hour hand to set it to 12am or something like that. Then, once you do that you could open the locked door in the starting area to get to level 13. And level 12 is a Class 0. So, no entities in level 12. and every room you go in the weirder it gets, since level 12 is called, "The Matrix." And one fact about level 12 is that any recording or photo of level 12, is replaced with a black and white TV static. But don't add that. and HOLY MOLY THAT'S A LOT OF TYPING. good video I've been playing it and got to level 3.  Edit: I just realized I should've typed this in the Discord sooooooooooooooooooooo
The puppets didn’t search for us in the game we played but knowing it was dark and not knowing what was out there was really scary. Thank you for making this game and I can’t wait to see for what lies in the future!
Yo fancy there is an actual VR backrooms game called NoclipVR and also it kinda uses the same player model design and the entities on it are DIFFERENT and same with the levels so yeah just letting you know
12:10 vr
Fancy can you fix a bug on the pitfalls wherw they can glitch and fly over the pitfalls by spam e while side   ways

Ayoooooo please add more levels
The thing is this game is yes a bit long but can be beaten in under 30 minutes if you're lucky but also very good

3:10 oh no, poor gu OH CRAP HES HERE!
I thought this game was free:(
Could you make it available on consoles? Preferably both consoles? Thank you
will you add the minus levels like level -1 and sub levels like level 1.1?
VR support for this game would literally be the end to all other VR games.
Is yours the game? you god bru
i cant see the game in my ipad. does it have to be a laptop or smthing?
Game?
The animated king is not scary and is too easy
Love your game wish I could play it 😢
No vr 1:00
0:12
Hey me and my friends really liked your game and we had a great time playing it. Haven't laughed that hard in a while. But i think after first 3 levels the game starts repeating itself. You basically just wonder around the map without really much to do and you can literally beat in in like 5 minutes, no puzzles, no monsters. Maybe try adding more puzzles to the level and make the levels more time consuming? But other than that, that's a great game ty for the experience Btw our favourite level was the second one
Fancy for create a new level and antity can you put the ''shygay'' (scp 096) but in the backroom-for not dead..just not see in eyes him...
dude you have been KILLING IT you 100% should keep working on this game and hopefully others !!
Spoilers.
add the bone theaf
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
When you put it on vr put it on app lab
Bro I don’t know how but the flying truck on level 94 coming close to the camera a superspeed scared me when I knew it was happening
Ok I wanna suggest something for players, if we could change outfits or change the color and have an item shop or perks to assist u in game, thanks hope u see this
please add beta or alpha or any thing for us the poor :( OR make the game free or i can just pay by tacos or macdonals
game👍
Lvl 94 be like peppa pig in Ohio edition
I love your game
Oml this would be so amazing in vr
I was playing with a friend on level 94 and they were trapped in a van at night and all the kid entities were targeting them and I was stuck behind a fence outside in the dark and didn’t die💀we were both shocked XD
6:29 those entities are like insanity. This entity scare me a lot...
the game looks very good prob the best backrooms game ive seen but its sad that its not for free
My brother, my best friend, and I all bought you game a few days ago! We all came in blind and had a fantastic time. There were many hilarious moments that I won't forget. One being that we didn't understand the door mechanics for some doors where you get put inside of the room when interacting with the door rather than opening and closing it. My brother thought he was dead and began unknowingly eating kettle chips loudly into the mic whilst being the last alive inside the animation. Thanks for a interesting game, and I'm looking forward to updates :D
The only thing I'm not the biggest fan of is the story. Unless if you were trying to bring your own idea which is actually alright. But if you are trying to be lore accurate, then well you are kinda far off. It feels like your confused with M.E.G Backrooms and Kane Pixels Backrooms. The yellow suits and a monster on level 0 with all the system setups are all apart of Kane's idea. But then you also try to incorporate M.E.G lore. They are 2 separate backrooms universes essentially. Your game defiantly fits better with whats called "ASYNC Foundation," which is the Kane Pixels version of the backrooms explores.
Can you add level 100
Me and my friends have been trying to find a horror survival game for a while, glad I found this one cuz we have been having a blast. Every time we get to the next level I hear "we have to be almost done right?" but once I mention we are only about half way through they get shocked and excited at the same time lol. Keep up the good work dood, keep adding to the game as much as you can.
can you recreate this game in roblox studio pls
sugestion: make the skin stealers follow you for a bit before turning to their scary form and kill you; make the skin stealers feel more like normal peaple before they reveal themselves and kills you
please change the animated king model this one really isnt fitting
I have idea what if u put this game on vr that would be crazy
Hey bro can you add the game to app store/mobile lol
I know this videos kinda old but I just wanna say I hate that level with the dogs and the brick walls it scares the hell outta me
please make a mobile version
Add more level to your game to me good
I was watching kaka_v420 but this is better😀
I really hyped about McDonald's
E I didn't know you could drive the trucks on level 94 so me and my friend just walked all the way to the castle :(
Making a crafting system would be Nice
If you add Xbox support that would be funny, I’d like that
Well the animated king is just a king thats it :)
CAN YOU ADD LEVEL 188
Female death moths be like:you are my child now
You should make the supermarket
In order to make level 6 a bit creepier, the LiDAR scanner should make a light plinging sound that alerts enemys that are very close whenever you use it so that you cant just hold out the scanner while hiding
I just finished a playthrough of your game last night and I will most definitely be playing it again. Good job!
I just love the vids
I’m a huge backrooms fan (except for k pixels I prefer the original) and this game is the closest thing I’ll ever get to the original so thank you
3:33 I screeched so loud I almost broke the glass cup near me.
i dont mind if u dont do it but can u make the death moth bigger cuz it felt way too small to pick the player up and bro i respect the time and effot  u put into making this game cant wait to see more
My suggestion for stamina: add a line that shows how much stamina you have to run like in security breach
€7.19 why 😐😐😐
I suggest that you add hunger or something to keep an eye on too and  collectable resouces from certain entities that you could defeat with melee weapons. And you could find firesalts and other crafting laying around items to make small firecracers and other stuff to distract and scare entities.
Already had the game from back when it was free on Steam and bought it for my friends and I wanna say I love what you did with the game and had a good time playing it, learning how to beat the levels while monitoring sanity and all, props to you! Looking forward to potential updates for more playable levels of the Backrooms!
my guy male deathmoth are friendly and also you can make an army of them by just giving them some almond water please add this to the game because an army of deathmoth will be a good idea
did anyone get scared at 3:34 tbh i jumped
Yoo Fancy I have a question will you make Level 8 in the next update? If you respond I'll buy the game.
My suggestion for the skin stealers: when my friends and i played for the first time, we did more walking than running. this is because we wanted to explore the area to make sure we didn't miss something. I think the skin stealers should walk towards you instead of bolting towards you. This could use the ID cards mechanic more. We didn't bother using the ID cards because we could tell that the man running towards us was a skin stealer. Once the skin stealer reveals itself, then by all means start running.
Pipe dreams is a maze u should have to wonder in it and after like 5 min of wondering u will find that long hallway and be forced to go one of the ways and also make it so if u go the way to lvl fun first the ceiling falls down and blocks the way
Wow i have seen some youtubers play this game you made it well👏👏
I just bought this game and am looking forward to shitting myself lol
lmao
Amazing game
I think id be great if you could slide by running and then pressing crouch!
Wanderer:oh a visitor! 4:51
I wonder when part 3 will come out
This game is great! I just made a video about it, and i have to say it's the most fun game i have ever played!
Add in level 3000  monsters death wale  in escape the backrooms

Add this game to mobile NOW
i love your game
Can you please make the game free! I can't play. I poket money is 1 dollar. For one year
The skinstealer should have a more docile ai instead of just running towards you which is too obvious
I'll literally explode my computer when this sublevel gets added 8:08
What game is this😊
On random ideas that I had when you open the almond water cans can you make the cans open up
For the name tags let a player choose their name and then put the name on the name tax just a little fun detail that I thought of
Heeyyyy, lofe you videos, could you pwease add the gane on xbox?
Bro… the graphics of this game are insane. How is this guy making a AAA game alone. I’m a game developer, and for me, I can’t believe that the game footage he put is the real ingame footage.
https://m.youtube.com/hashtag/saveechovr Please help us save echo vr. ready at dawn (the devs) are going shut down the game. The community in this game has be built up for nearly 6years so please help us save the game we love so much
You should also make level 666 called ‘’ The Hallway To Hell
So he sources from the Fandom, not the wikidot? Cuz I heard the wikidot is more "canon" or at least accurate to the real idea of the backrooms, since it's got more moderation and such
make level 232
I think you should make it so you can customize your backrooms character somehow? I dont know I just thought it might be cool like you can add headlights? And maybe add a currency? Or something.  👇Like If You Agree So He Can See This
Will this be on console 🤔
Maybe you can make it so when you loose your sanity you’ll be an insane monster that’ll be cool
in the beginning of the game it says what is this place but your in a suite so you were obviously ready to be in the backrooms cause if you nonclipped then you would just be in normal clothes
When vrrrrrrrrr
you should add animations on the almonn water sorry for my grammer
whats vr support
I can't stop to watch all the episodes of this serie a couple of time, plz send help lmao
im a game maker like you my guy but i loved your game but there is only three mistakes you done (im sorry for saying this) the skin stealers need to be more slower and scarier when they get out an persons body and they need to kill a person and get their body because they called it skin stealers and dying needs to be more cursed like not get it on pieces it needds to slow down entities they need to slowly consume them and there is just blood every where i think you can do this three things my friend i believe in you and i think you can do better upgrades to your game thanks for listening me comrade
Can't believe someone still going on with this backrooms joke. well, it's nice to see the game by itself tho
Mate, I've played this version, the level with dogs is LITERALLY DOGSHIT
2 weeks late
next step: make it free
You should add maybe friendly entities and like  in the hub a shop or something
Thank you, this game is a fever dream. Please keep updating it, it's the best backrooms game out there.
suggestions: Level 7 (thallasophobia) Clumps, The thing on level 7, level 8 (cave system)

You should add the level of run for your life that would be a fun level
Aren’t you supposed to cover yourself in the death moth jelly because it will make you like a male death moth to the female?
You should make liquid pain kill you slowly
Hey! I got a level idea:like in Stanley parable when you cheat it sends you to the serious room but in backrooms there is a level called "You Cheated" you can find it on wiki and when people cheat you can make an AI to send them there (I know, if you try to do it, it is gonna be very hard.).
Your Game IS the BEST backroom game without dude

Fancy could you please add jump scares in this game because all the says you’re remaining footage

Nobody ever gets fooled by skin stealers, you should make levels try to split up the players more.
I have a question, are you ever gonna make the game Mac or console accessible or is that not possible? Just wanted to know
Would be sick in vr
You should have a heat scanner and one of those things here than the final ever lights out the heaps and I hope you see the monster and their light up red the scanner that you use in lights out hope you see
I've been playing this game for a while now and I actually love it I'm about to post a play through on my channel One question I do have for Fancy tho is when is the hub coming?
You should add a ceep inventory feature
May you can add an outside the backroom slevel, where you need to find a way to glitch into them.
You should make the end
bro pls dont vanish like dani
Mate, the game is just marvelous!!! I truly enjoyed playing it with my friend, we were both scaried and amazed! Pool level is such a beauty! But, bro, the boiler level truly sucks, it's impossible to find the right way to the exit.

Yay vr support! now I can enhance my horror experience to 360 degrees of Horror nonsense
0:01 rats when they see a kfc deep frier
you should probably add lvl 33,22,3999 and 188
Me and my cousin decided to try out your game after seeing all the differences between each level. We loved it and can’t wait for more updates. Also the pitch black room with the light gun was so sick, but maybe too easy with being able to see the monster when it gets close. All I did was stay still and he would walk by, maybe you don’t need to take the scanning away but could up his speed depending on the sound the player is making. This is just a thought from me. Keep it up and can’t wait for more.
You should allow mac support now that the new metal engine allows for robust graphics 🥺
hotel rooms were sooooo fun man! keep up the good work :)
I thought the Male deathmoths were the friendly ones.
You should add the game on ps4

It's funny that in every video the same hazmat dude is in a MrBeast video pose lol
you should add scratchers to level 2 they are cool
When you add more levels you should add some helpful entities or one you can tame like the male death moths
I think u should add the levels warehouse, infinite airport which u can fly to certain levels on, and welcome to the jungle edit: I recently found out (2 minutes later after that comment lol) the level museum which is the final room apparently and it has a small display of every level and u can teleport to there and the suberbs level and the cave system and finally no peeking

All Nightmares are extremely dangerous entities, resistant to all kinds of firearms and most sharp objects. Nightmares appear at the Terror Dreams.

How many updates do you make this game for the backgrounds How many updates do you make this game
After watching this video, I immediately bought the game)
It should be more like a labyrinth. not a puzzle where you need to figure out how to get to next mission (level). Also the first level should also have random messenges written on the walls to make it scarier and some random stuff like some furniture (chairs, tables)
bro the flying truck got me at 3:31
I like the that fancy is focusing on levels rather than entities, I mean, it's a backrooms game not some crappy escape the creepy pasta game

Fancy you should try to add this to console that would be great I think you should make it on Xbox or Playstation.
You should add the train to nowhere it basically brings you to different levels without going to the hub
this guys crazy nonstop building and also when the truck hit him it honestly got me XD
Hey Fancy i didnt know anything about the backrooms before iplayed your game but ayyy man this is some pice of art ur producing here. Im so hyped for the new levels keep it up man.

This game need procedural animation think about how creepy the hounds would be with it. I would also like to see the tiny moths use modified boid code.
I dont know how to finish the game
0:10 bro canceled his emote💀
Day 13 of asking Fancy to add level you cheated
I literally have the urge to see your code .I know you don't usually have to write code in UE 5 but still.
can you make the skin stealers less suspicous and make them split up intetionally so when they come back one is fake
ok im gonna stop asking for you to unban me
Yeah I play that game once I have my gaming setup and money to pay it for, which probably will be around next 2-5 years lol

and you still didn't unban me
for real i did

ok so now im banned from every thing that you do fancy ok and i know now but just cause the game was realy good and i wanted to play it but it got me banned so if i delete it will you let me back into the discord server
And your new update after this update you should add level 11 and level 10 in level 9 because I would love that
Yo it would be cool if its on mobile
This is absolutely fantastic! Great job on all the progress you've made, and best of luck on continuing your amazing career as a game developer.
Played the game for the first time last week with a friend it was scary af. We spend like 2 hours on the hounds level because they would only be blinded once
Bro that truck scared me so bad I jumped I think about a half an inch
There’s the m.e.g computer and there’s a gate.exe but can you add entity 666? The happyfiles. Edit: o-k. I get it with the gate.exe. Yep sorry. Maybe a random computer in level 4 or level the end?. Also there’s an entity called entity 104 also known as photoshops. Yeah so if you wanna add it then that would be awesome.
Wait didn't you add the procedural generation in the first video about making The Backrooms?
Add a skin costume shop pls🥺🥺
Can we play this in android
I like it so much but i am sad Its not free cuz my mom never gives me money 😢
Please edit Steam Trailer for the game

1. hello from Russia! 2. I saw a lot of "backrooms" games but a most of them looks.. Not so good, like yours. Anyway good work and Im cant wait to see new levels and models and more.
Based off ending and fancys pattern level 7 8 9&10 are next do you agree?
hi fancy can u please help me with a game its called fortune of the dead and its a fnaf fan game but i dont know how to make games  i subed
I'm loving this series and soon I'll be buying the game. From watching other playthroughs, I highly suggest adding more explanations for what you do in the level when you enter. I watched people like 8bitryan play and were confused about what to do and miss out on some of the amazing features
Level 5 is pain lol
do the flying trucks in level 94 actually exist in your game?
W dev
Could you make levels 100, 188, and 1,000? They're my favorites!
Add pinhead and sleeping bag that takes 3 bars in backpack and sleeping bar cause you may play this game for a while
Could you make level 3999
Make a mac version please
Could u add the ability to look back while running
Out of everything i got from this, its that i want to explore the moth hive.
the truck scared me
Day 12 of asking Fancy to add level you cheated
What is the outro Song?
Man didn't even know you could drive the ice cream trucks
Level 94 should have infinite generation bc in roblox it dose exist and it dosent crash your game at all
YOU HAVE SUPER BAD GAME😎😎😎😎😎👍👍👍👍👍👍
will this ever be on vr
Can you add it to apple computers
level 7 uptade date ?
Congrats on 500k!!!! 🥳
Is this ever gonna be on console? I play on the PS4 and i see tons of cool games but they're always not there. But im fine if it wont be.
the start of the video was perfect
THE TRUCK ONE IS BOTH SCARY AND FUNNY🤣🤣🤣
Would this run on quest 2? This would be a banger on app lab
add a zillion more monsters
Please add mobile support
Cant wait for next update
what the fuck happend i was signign dream on before this vid started and the beginning of the vid got me shocked
Level 576
Hey team up with two star and work to make another horror game (He made choo choo Charles)
Me playing single player, what I hear : „Hello?“ „Is anyone there“  Yellow bi- I mean player, running too me at full speed after I intentionally went back to fill my inventory with useful stuff.
yay update mới
My dad left me
Man it's prob only for pcvr but I would love to play escape the backrooms in VR playing multiplayer that sounds like so much fun
How much money is the game?
Can you make this compatible with apple computers as well? Having it as a Windows only game is discrimination in my book for those who want to play your game but don't have a windows computer
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
7:33 when you locked your door
great game but one suggestion: remove having to find the door to the hub i dont wanna spend hours tryna find the door to level 94
I know what could be a cool idea, to add a kick to the game so you can hurt and scare off hounds, and you can also use the kick to break down doors that are locked, also you should make it to where skin stealers and hounds can break down doors, but keep up the good work fancy I love this game that you made and I can see how much work and dedication you put in this game so I just wanna thank you for that.
i cant believe ive dedicated 436 hours to this game
Make more levels
Fancy some youtuber did it already
Ok
Is this available in vr?
Bro your game is amazing!! Totally awesome!! Looking forward to more updates.
Noice
What clown? Animated king? You should do a cartoon king
Can you like update level run for your life and can you add level 52 the final level is 92233
Today infinite lists beat your game he Sayed it was the hardest game ever and the part that he Sayed was the hardest was the hounds
Can you make a story for how we got in the backrooms?
IT'S LIKE YOU HAVE READ EVERYTHING I POINTED OUT ABOUT THIS GAME!!!! Ik you didn't but i complained about that the levels didn't have random generation BUT NOW THEY HAVE like damn... I also pointed out accuracy of levels and you're making them accurate now. might buy this again
1:16 Retard run
if your gonna work on the player. i have a question why are you in a suit? like when you fall in the backrooms you just look like that? and in the teaser of 94 your not in the suit? like what?
You should make the skin walkers break doors in the hotel level and that you can also barricade the doors too
Fancy can you please make a cutceane for when you get into the backrooms and some times my character gets stuck so I only can go into chat and meny.
What the heck a female but it’s not bigger so when does female bag is bigger than me I will kill the
YOU should get a full team(100+) people
I HATE YOUR STUPID GAME WHY IS THERE SANITY YOU MADE ME DIE ON THAT F*CKING HARD LEVEL THE END LEVEL I HATE YOUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
8:50 the fact what he's say has to do nothing with ur game make me laugh
Hi Fancy me and my friend, we have the ambition to make a backroom game and for that I would like to ask you how you did the mounts please. It would be nice if you could also answer me no  I love you, your game is great!
Add smiled repellent
Day 11 of asking Fancy to add level you cheated
So, it seems that ssundee and his friends has friends have found two exploits in the game and u may want to check out the video and find solutions on how to fix them.
Yay congrast of getting 500k subs and making the best backrooms game :D
You shold add an ending
I found this game on Roblox that is either heavily inspired or is just a straight up copy of the game. The name of the Roblox game is "Da Backrooms"
"Now these male deathmoths are some of the most dangerou-" Wrong, the female ones are dangerous and spit acid on you, the female ones are dangerous because they must protect their babies. Edit: Oh yeah that makes more sense
Suggestion: Add Kelvin to the temperature measurement thingy
Add level 188
Is this gonna be more of a puzzle game or survival game ?
Hey, I really love your video game!!! I love watching multiplayer horror games. I know this game from Indonesian famous YouTube gamers called MiawAug, he played this game with his friends.
Fun fact about death moths (male) They can be teamd by giving them moth jelly (the purpule thingy)
3:06 I dont like the doll is ugly can you make it hand made pls?
.I hope he adds level The end, 3999 and 46
Very, very nice job man.
Like how you nocliped here and why
Can add lore pls
Please add this to iOS
I'm so glad that the Backrooms finally has their SCP Containment Breach!!!! From what I've seen from other Backrooms games this is the only one I thought looked great and so far it definitely is. Can't wait to see what other levels you add.
can you add a 1954 penny to the game which you can randomly find through the maps
I've been keeping eyes on you and your game Bought it today started making content from it already its pretty neat and diff then what i usually play hope i can get my Sub count up a bit from some of the content

yo fancy! is it ok if u make the suits better, make their shoulders lower and their bodys thicker(back and front) also add a feminine look to some characters.(in the start of the game ask which body would they want to look like - feminine or manly look) thats all!
No way this in frickin VR???!!!!??!!

'The beast of level 5'-a monster that can be anything can be in paintings transform to a chair and other things.the more you explore the more chances you will find the beast dont get anycloser beacause the beast is so powerfull it can mess with anyone that comes here it looks like chutulu but no pirate hat "safe entities-the talking cat-a entity that talks to anyone feed him some food to gain you fourtune this cat tells your fourtune and bidding.
The insanity level does not work I played all of the game no insanity
6:35 wth i tought i was gonna go against an entity, not the u.s army....
i guessed the elevator code in level 1 first try could you make it random
POV: you find a comment that’s not a read more              Gotcha
w
There should be a item called “Normal Pills” which makes your sanity go to max
When are the game modes like hide and seek and survival gonna come out? or are they already out? Also your game is awesome!
i heard that iggy azalea made a song on you
Not to be a stickler but level 5 has an entity called ,,the beast of level 5" which is basically the god of that level from what I got
How do I get this game
Level 6 reminds me of the deep dark in Minecraft. 😂
This is awesome also I found a decryption of the king of the animations The King’s appearance can only be described as beautiful, and definitely without signs of mangling or decay. Upon his head, he wears the Crown of the Kingdom, which shows his status as the king. He is most definitely the king! The King is beautiful inside and out. The King cannot be damaged in any means.
Wish I could get it
We about to wait some months for another video now
can you add it to mac?
Please please please please please add this to consoles  This would be so amazing. Sadly, I don’t own a PC so I can’t play this game and I only play on Consol so I’d love to have this on Consol sometime that would be amazing honestly
I like how the game has such good quality but when he animates scenes himself it looks terrible. Idk if its just me  but I think its funny
This game has been some fun for me I can’t lie , me and my mans shed real tears at the crouch animation for like 30 mins … the atmosphere is great and then there’s a couple goofy aspects jus makes this game so enjoyable 💪🏾🔥 keep going g
I have an issue. really enjoyed the game up until the point with the computers (where the password is supposed to be 'itheardyou'. That password just doesn't seem to work for me. I thought the puzzle would be more complicated but after an online search it's very clearly supposed to be 'itheardyou'. I tried switching back and forth between QWERTY and AZERTY keyboards and typing 'itheqrdyou' to account for the a/q difference, but none of this seems to work. Anyone that can help me with this? The game looks really nice so far and I'd love to continue playing
Make the backrooms crawlspace. And maybe make some levels random so when you escape one och dont end up in the same as the last time you played it.
place your bets, will fancy actually add procedural generation or will karlson come out first, granted we almost certainly wont find out until we're all dead but yk
me omw to the hive
Day 10 of asking Fancy of adding level you cheated
Can u put level 232 în escape The backrooms?
This game is amazing but there's One problem, some people might use discord instead of the gamechat so is there a way to make it so it uses discord as the ingame chat or smth?
how would i play this game now im afraid of butterflies
I have a problem with the smilers now being just faces in the dark. They're simply not scary anymore. Their faces get on top of the lights from the other safe rooms very often and, not only that, you can use a flashlight on them to see that they are just faces, the light goes through them. Also, their former spider appearance really worked, because you couldn't see them fully, but some of their parts were visible when they were near your room and your brain did the rest of the job. I suggest you give them back their spider appearance but make them not visible in the flashlight, just like they're not visible when the lights are on, even if there's only a tiny part getting in the view. This will work well for their creepiness. Or if you really want to keep them as faces, make them not visible when they get on top of the lights from the other rooms and when the flashlight is used on them. The other suggestion is simply not giving the player a flashlight before they finish level 1. Also, I feel really weird about these random generations. Pre set, but well executed linear experience is perfectly well, and I really enjoyed the game. Just maybe make the hotel 'Look up' stage bigger, because while I absolutely love everything about this level, it felt more like a normal hotel with less than 30 rooms, the only difference being two entities roaming the halls. The level is good, but just make the map a bit more complicated. Also, I think it would be a great idea for the numbers of the rooms to be completely random 3-digits so that it's not that easy to remember where is the room you need to find. It would also really add to the atmosphere and make you truly feel like you're in the backrooms, despite the level being a bit too small. Back to the topic, maybe you can make like 10 or 15 different versions of every stage for the replayability and a random one will appear on every playthrough. The problem with completely randomized levels is that most likely the game will not be balanced. Finding an exit to a level might get ridiculously difficult and a lot of enemy placements might turn out very unfair. Not gonna lie, I would love it if the levels were bigger, but randomizing everything would lead to massive problems that might destroy all the fun and make the game frustrating
i love your game plz do a master classe for reginald plz
This guy is actually making our backroom dreams come true 😄
Can you add monile suport
Add clumps or I will cry
the animated king is just a blue aura and thats it
3:30 HOW THE HELL DID I GET JUMPSCARED BY A FLYING TRUCK ?!!?!?

Nobody. The guy in the back HEllEy coPtEr heLLeY CoPTer

Wait. you said that you added procedural generation but you didn't   in this video.
add maxwell the dingus cat as a easter egg
Add it to PlayStation,Xbox and etc plsss
When is this game on ios and android?
Is i on vr? And if its not pls add it on oculus so you dont need to get a pc to use it
So where's that console port??
are you planning on having vr support work on the quest 2?
playing this on vr would be sick
Idea for a mechanic: If a player uses exploits or somehow reaches an unreachable area then they should be teleported to level "You cheated" and basically make it a living hell for the exploiters
This raises the question, what would happen if Kratos went to the back rooms?
Can you make it on Xbox or Playstation
I wish I could play this but I don’t have a computer
yessss! the liminal space is finally liminal!
123abc
Add level 188
Just finished the game with some friends and my god, was it scary, suspenseful and fun at the same time. Amazing work and I can't wait to play more Levels :)
pay
can you add it to mac ?
Keep up the good work! I love playing this game!
you should start a game company with dani
YOU GOT PAST 500,000!!
add level 0hi0
500,000k!
please don’t add Vr support I’m begging
There’s a guy called Matt in your discord server that’s abusing his power unrightfully banning people and just being really rude
I think you should post videos playing the the game I would watch that
Sounds good but I don't think the sanity meter is necessary to add to the game
when the game is on vr i will buy it on day one
all i can sey is DAAAAAAAAAAAAAAM
you should make it that the other items in the other level like the ir scanner, bug spray and the thermometer be used in other levels. like the ir scanner can show some monsters and mark some points on a ground or wall. the bug spray can ward off death moths and maybe some monster (with limited uses.) the thermometer is useless. next update ill bet you will make it that flashlight run out of batteries and make them replaceable. the hub is kinda useless, you should make it that you can store items in the hub, make it like a base of operations and add some damn lore.  i love the game, its just that im recommending some stuff you should add. the items that are only used in one level arent cool, because they are useless. but the ir scanner, lights out is the best backroom no thinking needed.
Me going into the hive thinking it was a new level 😂
where can I get this game?
u must put alot of effort into this!
My name is Bry100ps
Inside squad three
Hey see people are being toxic in your discord
Thanks I am loving this.
Your game is simply amazing bro, can't wait for more level and the hub and please add some easter egg.
The new update is totally lit. Keep up with the good work.
I can't wait for VR support!
Maybe you should make it so in level 6 if you can go insane in multiplayer you become a wretcher and you can kill other teammates.
Can You Make The Game Free To Play???
Would it be possible to put this game on console?
Your game needs money
Fancy please make your game free
Here is a suggestion: add a meme difficulty. Level 0 would have tons of crabs and a room with thousands of them dancing and at the middle of the room would be tons of entities dancing and will kill you if you dont dance with them. Level 1, the entity would be amongus red and will shapeshift into yellow.  Level 2 would be level 2 because i cant think of anything. Level 3, the hounds would be pooping every second.  Level 4,  you can come up with that.  Level 5, all the death moths (male and female) turn into the Wenomechainsuma dog. the music would change into Wenomechainsuma. Level 6, light. make us go blind. Level 7, the water is yellow.  Level 94, the flying vans try to crash into you purposely and if you get in one, you will be trapped in there until the 10 PM curfew. Level 94 castle, The Animation King will be the joker.
you should add kittys room btw
isnt there any safe rooms?
But where do we hide?
Devoid of entities
Called winter abyss
Add level 101
so this game on vr gonna be free?....pls :C i need good vr backrooms game [free] [no noclipvr]
Very scary and fun
Add funking frowners!!
Dude, this is incredible !  I give you a proposal : Can you make the negative levels of the backrooms : There are several negative levels, I propose you to do from level -0 to -10, and you can also do level 231, it is that level which is interconnected with level 0 as in the Kane Pixels video try it, it is the level where the kitchen and stairs
Can you add the promised lands
hecc

Too bad level 0HI0 is not here
hey im tryimg to play with my friend on steam but it is not letting us play
Can we please have a deathmoth as a pet. Ive always wanted that in a backroom game
Reviving dead teammates by other teammates by collecting their identity cards laying on the floor where they died and doing something with the id card would be intense and cool.
im the 500k! subed! i think..
Will there be a setting to disable entity spawning?
why cant u add the bacteria on level 0
Maybe next time you Will adding Shady grey level
You should add the ability to tame certain entities which is accurate to the lore. Now they wouldn’t kill other entities instead might give you a hint if their is an entity near by.
Bro I love the game just from videos, I don't have a PC so I can't really play it, but it looks so good. Also, dunno if the outdo music was the same as his other vids but still fire ash. Love this guy
Level five lore kinda reminds me of Roblox doors
Add part hosts to level fun, make them spawn more partygoer’s, and also make you able to use bug spray on them so partygoers stop constantly spawning.   Add level 18 and add the entity “Plush Dino,” make the level slowly drain down your sanity, but the plush Dino will make your sanity will go up to max until you leave the level. (Has a 25% chance of spawning)  Also add Level 974 like you said you would do during your first video. Make it where kitty is blocking the only exit and you have to do a scavenger hunt to where you have to find three pink toys. Also make it where you only get in there when you pick up a pink octopus toy and get sent to the level (it sends you to the next level when you complete it)
Can you please get rid of the update because I am just a kid and I want the game to be easier.
I can't tell if I've seen this or not. Damnit.
the female death moths do they have melons?
Smilers are different sizes in different level
Smilers are different sizes or different level level two smilers are smallAs level eight smilers are big
The dark scanner level blew our minds!!! We are gushing over this game
Please I beg of you to add a penny at the last level some where in the level
You say you’re afraid of bugs, but your game has a lot of them
NEVER GONNA GIVE YOU UP, NEVER GONNA LET YOU DOWN, NEVER GONNA TURN AROUND AND FORGET YOU 🗿
Backrooms level 0.11 and 0.111 and 0.01 and 0.0
I REALLY appreciate people making games based on the original wiki backrooms.
Please for the love of god add a sandbox exploration mode
Make it that when the vhs date is set to april 1 that it makes the game silly.
five nights at freddys night 4, you close the door on Bonnie but you aren't fast enough to close the door on freddy...
I wanna be like you
Can u add the sewer level? Because I hate sewers and I think it’s pretty cool because it’s pretty scary with the monsters, and very strange for me the sewers.
Add level 169
Where do I get the game by the picture near the end it looks like steam but I just want to make sure. Oh ya and how much money does it cost?
Vr port would be horrifying
Is these game free or not that game looks cool
Fun fact is that I played this game today and youtube put this in my recommended
One of my dream games was always a proper backrooms game thank you for this!!
I like how fancy is interested to make more and bigger levels so that the players won't be bored
CAN YOU PLEASE MAKE THE GAME FREE
Bro if this game was free, oh my god this will be fire !
I love noclip and always have a blast with my friends I dint even know you made it. My fav level is defiantly level fun. Keep up the good work
What if u add a cut scene but its just  a guy falling off a mountain with music and whatever you want to be the rest
make it free
Hay dude I love your game but I got to ask can we all get a sneak peek of more updates coming to the game in the future???
you become famous my guy, how does it feel?
Day 1 for asking for VR support for your game
Vr version?
OA mean level 94
How do you beat level 95
Imagine level 11 but you stumble upon the secret route to eye of argos base
Idea for the game: You could make the animated king as just a normal king sitting on a throne and there are different mini games that represents some of our feats
make it free, get ùarketed with ads, money pb solved
Vr now big boy
As a huge fan of the Backrooms, I was totally amazed by the fact that someone is actually creating a multiplayer game, that at least has more levels besides level 0 (like most of the backrooms games) and perhaps in a future the most realistic backrooms game ever created. Keep working like that you are doing a fantastic job. Greetings from Spain
Can you add the back rooms entity that can turn to anything you desire and leads you to the exit
you should add stain on the walls the takes away sanity
ı hope they add a level with boats and a giant fish monsters
i never cared that much for buying this game, but after watching this video I instantly bought it
The animated King is a card of a king
It’s actually 600 Million miles of inescapable maze
f8kse  the voise
Make sure you don’t starve or dry up because you haven’t drink water or didn’t sleep or else your turn into a wrech in the back rooms, of course
please stop ruining the backrooms
you should completely change the behavior of smilers in level 1 because it is not at all consistent with their original behavior, smilers are not afraid of light, they just hate it so if a player is standing in the light they would like to kill him Itak. here is a description of their behavior from the wiki -  The Smiler is attracted to light, and will chase anything they see with a light, so distracting it by throwing a light source at it would be great for an escape. The Entity will only start to attack if you panic and retreat, or if a loud noise is made. Keep eye contact, and move away slowly to ensure your survival. Using a Smiler Exterminator will cause the Entity to retreat or lose its senses for a long period of time.
Jooo JoshA at the end bless you <3
I got an idea. What if you could go to any random level in the game. Like you could noclip through level 1 into level 5 so the new level is always random
The animated king is a king also there were funny parts that I laughed 😂
Poderia ter um level igual ao filme O Poço, onde você vai descendo e encontra novas entidades e desafios para continuar descendo
Yummy, aluminum water.
I whant him to add a shotgun and maybe a blazer o and campsites
Do your game will be available for console ?
What's the game called
hilarious every time
Got the game.  So good.  Would buy again.  If I could donate I would
Yo I like this game but I don't have pc/laptop to play it with my friends can you make it on mobile?
Beverly room is a sort of a meeting room or a dining room
Can you add skins
man you're the best
It would be cool if you added level 3999
Hope you forget to add VR 💀
I was the only one who had a bug when you transfer almond water from your pocket instead of a flashlight and it dupes into a backpack?
i think they should add a multiplayer minigame where one of your friends is actually a skinwalker and you have to find out who and kill them.
The only thing he should add is a save procedure so that u can save whenever u want to and also your items
Do pt2
i was playing the lights out level and we didn't think to click to make the little dots of light show up so we just spent 20 minutes walking into walls until we eventually looked it up :(
Day 8 of asking Fancy to add level you cheated
Okay, memes aside. It would actually be really cool to get a pool-rooms level that is more or less just passive, similar to the actual one. Maybe with some pools taking you into far less benign areas at a low chance.
Pool rooms pool rooms pool rooms
Actually the smiler has body
Твоя игра очень невероятная! Это действительно суперский проект, чудесная инди разработка! Мне крайне понравились все обновления и уровни, очень жду продолжения)) И отдельное спасибо за мультиплеер и именно каноничную разработку. Потому что все другие искажают вселенную как хотят. А вот посмотреть на оригинал всегда очень интересно! Мы с другом специально купили игру в стиме, чтобы поддержать.
when the game comes out is it gonna be free?
outro music?
Level fun is way to hard
the waffle house has found its new host
This is incredible! Thank you so much for staying true to the wiki and not just talking about some pseudointellectual liminal space sh*t. I love backrooms for the lore and the wiki, not the liminal concept and I'm so glad to see youtube catching on to the lore :)
Fancy is now looking like a professional game designer
With this new sanity mechanic there is an opportunity for a new death animation In multiplayer. Maybe instead of all your limbs getting dismembered you can make the player look like they’re going well insane before falling to the ground dying
Add phone edition
Can you add this game to Xbox or VR
Bro that flying truck scared me so much
Moth jelly makes u faster... Did he eat the moth jelly? 🤨
Lol 3:33
Fancy one question, and please reply. Could you join Roblox and like export all of the Escape The Backrooms monster rigs as an fbx then import them in Roblox studio with all their animations? I need them for testing games of Phantoms AI. To give the models to me friend my account, just search up BTL_PlumbingALT2 and friend the one named beluga. Please
the flying truck got me
bro made the warden in the backrooms
can you just go outside and record yourself running and import the shaking to run so that it dosent look like shaking is still the same but faster it will be more realistic please add this into the game
this dude is gonna be the second dani
I think it would be sick if you added random cutscenes before the game starts where you are in different places and different scenarios in which you clip into the backrooms, for example walking down a sidewalk and tripping into the backrooms, skateboarding at a skatepark and falling off your board, skydiving and falling into the backrooms, sleeping in a classroom and waking up in the backrooms, being in a fight and getting punched and knocked out into the backrooms etc..
You thought level 0 You gona make level longer
Can you please add this game to vr it will be really fun if you don’t know what it is I call virtual reality
In the MEG base, I'm not able to store items. What's wrong??
Can you please add Mobile support
I'm quite curious to play the game buuut I don't have any money to pay for it soo... yeah, gonna keep curious
add level 7 and level 8 and level 9 are for other update

@vanossgaming
Male deathmoths are small but they are harmless and can even be a companion
Hey fancy just a request for vr support can you please make it so if you don’t have a vr you can still play with your mate playing in vr
I just finished downloading the game Imma play it now❤
did you make noclip vr?
im buying later today good work
idea: add level ’you cheated’
I can’t get a pc it’s way too much, but If this ever came out on console I would 💩 myself
are you gonna add spider legs to the game?
PLEASE ADD MOBILE SUPPORT
Honestly probably my favourite internet series, and you seem very passionate about this game. Adding a Hub level in Level 4 would be absolutely awesome, making the game a multiplayer experience. Just a suggestion though ultimately do what you want to do, it's your masterpiece
You should add the memory worm level unknown look it up
Add gigachad as an entity. As you randomly wander the backrooms you have a chance to stumble upon a gym area where he's working out on a bench press. As you approach him he asks you to spot him, and after you've spotted him with his last 3 reps, he gets up, gives you some supplies one of which is a protein shake that heals you like almond water but also gives you some extra stamina, gives you a tip on where to go next, thanks you and walks away.
moths adds realism to everything
Can you add level 11 (the endless city) I thought it would be a cool idea.
you scam litle childer, about children  ...
You can add BoneThief in the game, that will be so cool! :D you are so good… 😊
Apparently there is more than one type of animations because of fan art
I hate the boiler room it is pain I spent one and a half hours trying to complete it!
you should rename your game to ''The true backrooms'' that will be more better.
Pls make this game free
I love this game, thx for making this game btw i love ur videos
Bro the houses and grass looks like my freind's minecraft house😂
The game is cool, but honestly, you didn't make monsters scary right. They should not be scary, but creepy and frightening! When a player plays his video, he should think: it doesn't seem scary, but something is repulsive. Let's take funny people as an example: they're creepy, but they're just a yellow substance with stick-habds and with a painted smiling face, so making them humanoid monsters is not a good idea. The worst redesign is to redesign a flying smile to look like a spider. Think about it
Can u make it Mobile
make it free
Will you add level 1.5 ?
What device is it on?
ur the best fancy
Day 7 of asking Fancy to add level you cheated
G-Guys where is my house like i just tripped on the ice
can you make pls level 188
100000000000000?
Fancy are you going to put your game on mobile? I really want to play it!
NO MONE?
you need to make the bone thife now oh and can it be a boss
69k likes lol
This needs to be In VR…. Nvm you mention it towards the end of the video lol
About the spray paint.. Maybe you could make some entitys recognize them? So it would be possible to lead your teammates or to misslead the entity.
The sound affects are to funny
If there is any room other than backrooms then it is not BACKROOMS 🗿
"Keep a thermometer on you" People who don't use Fahrenheit: ._.
please add mobile in game please
Theres an entity called the beast of level 5 and its head is a squid
Hey fancy I have an idea for a secret ending when you lose sanity in level 6 you become one of the whretches
pls leave the playermodel the same
Like your skills and sense of humour! Keep up the work!
hello i am nigerian population please make the max players more than 4
4:12 yes that is you lol 😂
I like your Channel 😊😅❤
The chad is back baby now where’s my VR support lol, oh God he’s adding the sub levels and soon we will get negative levels oh nvm VR is still coming
I think is cool, but what about all the mobile players
add vr suport
3:32 and avoid any  flying trucks because my terrible coding
2:21 oh s***t
This guy is the most talented coder in YouTube
Pls do Level cheated
Brah you already out of the level and now you change this And added it
Add snackrooms
8:48 it's a phone o course u gonna lag lmao-
this isnt cannon to the backrooms though
don't delete level FUN  put it after a few level like after 0.1 and call it party HOST!
Did you add the memory worm hypnotize people and then eat them drinking almond water will make you snap out
Make it if you see it more spawn try to kill you. How to beat it is try to escape by running forward and you will see black stuff and partygoers will come out and if you touch it you will die with party stuff falling down. How to get out ? you fine a red door goin into level 666.
add level 666
add party host pls entity number 167
Cough minecraft  cough biomes
im playing with a friend rn, and whenever i pick up an item and press left click to use it boots me from his game and we have to reset and start a new lobby just so he can invite me toi play again, all form the start. :(
the game looks great so far, but one issue, the animations dont look too good, they look like bad mocap animations, perhaps consider redoing them?
you should add rare entities
You should add darts in level fun for you can pop the balloons far away
Dani the Second Dude ur the best
OMG
Can you make it so we can play on the iPad?
Amazing… but you forgot to make the animated and animated king look like if it’s animating in stop motion. (Or at least it doesn’t look like it in the video)
Idea: Have generation code for each portion of a map then have it load and deload depending on where the player is and if they have a clear line of sight on that portion of the map.
Add 0Hi0
Nice dont add mcdnalds tho
I thought this game was free
Level 0.2 also was entities called tv heads and the level also falls apart so maybe in a futur update you could make so the tiles or walls can fall on the player? I think it would look good
Calyus said that you should make a spray to blind the demon dog for 2 minutes
Broogli made a video on the backrooms level 0 sublevels check it out
Can I run this game on a potato? Intel Integrated Graphics, i7-8565U cpu and 8 GB of RAM to be exact
Id like to see level nine the infite cave
if you end up adding almond water, it says male deathmoths can be tamed. same with doll face. (if they're alone)
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
CAN IT BE FREE TO PLAY!
mcdonalds had to compete with burger king so they expanded into the backrooms
I love the game, I have yet to finish it with friends but i just wanna spread some positive words <3
game is great but please fix the party area with the yellow dudes, they agro for no reason and it always take me and my friends like an hour to get through, we hate it.
Really nice project ! I'm also working on a backroom game with an infinite procedural generation, it's really entertaining to build ^^ Optimisation take most of the time but once done it will be done !  Really nice level design, can't wait to see your work evolve ! Backroom universe is really cool and making games on them is great, everybody got their own style and vision.
Pls make this game free
3:34 bro you really scared me
Will the game be released on Xbox?
cant wait till every level is procedual so the replayability is endless. i find games that have premade maps with premade puzzles boring because after you do it once its just the same thing over and over again, but with procedual generation its never the exact same and runs can vary in length
death moths are pretty sheesh (old term)
Just bought the game :(
Remove sanity, youre actively making your game worse by including it
those moths are the bane of my existence
03:35 JUMPSCARE
Congrats, you made me buy the game. I’m already excited to play and which other lvls are about to be added in later updates (game is downloading when placing the comment)
what game is this ? clearly it isn't Inside The Backrooms because that game ends at like the 3rd or 4th level
how to install you game on mobile?
the waffle house has found its new host
make your gme free pls🥺👉👈
The animated king is actually just a big ball of blinding light, but I like the clown idea better because it's more like the nostalgic vibe of the backrooms!
Can you put the game on oculus when you put VR support
A few days ago I was about to give up on a game I’ve been working on for 5 years because I could never get the program to work and my cousin who was helping me work on the game decided to quit so I lost hope on ever getting it finished  Then this video popped up on my for you page and it gave me hope and inspired me to keep going   Now I’m using unreal engine to try making the game (since it’s compatible with blender and stuff) and I’m making more progress than ever.  Thank you
FINALLY A VIDEO!!!!!
Kratos falling meme at the start was so funny 😂
fun fact, you can tame male deathmoths and keep them as pets if you give them food, you should add that into the game as i feel like having a companion would be cool!
Female death moths look terrifying but male ones are so cute
0:27 thats average
De game is hard
yeah nice original idea with the light gun lmfao
What about make the level 666
I got kinda a feeling the death moth have some crazy giant queen (not that I want you to turn this into a boss idea) cuz I love bugs and when it's like KILL THE QUEEN then ur literally trying to kill a MOM THAT HAS CHILDREN
What if you made the puppets more similar to Sesame Street. It would probably be creepier. But red eyed children are also terrifying.
Day 6 of asking Fancy to add level you cheated
Your game is so good I just want to get it but I don’t know how to download it so help me please how to download it please please help
M O B I L E  S U P P O U R T
Maybe you could add that you don’t start with the yellow suit, but you can find/craft it later on in the game?
Can you make something that look liké ᛃᛟᚢ᛫ᚹᛁᛚᛚ᛫ᚾᛖᚹᛖᚱ᛫ᚢᚾᛞᛖᚱᛊᛏᚨᚾᛞ᛫ᚦᛁᛊ᛫ᛊᛖᚾᛏᛖᚾᛊᛖ

I bought ur game twice and both times i refunded it
Change the screamer at the “!” level , make monsters drag the player into the dark when they lose
Return the old model of the entity from the fun room
mac support pls
Idea to add if you want to: A crafting menu, this I think would be great to be able to craft items that will make it easier to avoid or get away from backrooms entities instead of dying or crafting items to slow the backrooms entities down
When you say vr you don’t just mean pcvr right cos there’s so many great games that are pc exclusive
I WANT SHOWCASE OF ALL HUB WORLD ENTANECES
Will it come to xbox?
finished the game its amazing
The beginning: **skin stealer morphs into a frickin player** Camera: Am I a joke to you!?
Is the game free?
Since every time we make a video is like a month apart I watch every single video from the beginning every single time you make a new video and I love your them and I wanna join your discord but I don’t have discord 😢
Could you add the community levels as I love the thought of some levels where people have gathered and made liveable
El juego es increíble.
Whats is the game called?
the flying truck really jumscared me😂
Add a crafting system that allows you to craft weapons and improve your hazmat siut
It would be cool if you could tame the moths
i can’t wait to play this game on vr if it ever gets added
can  you pls put this on mobile it is very good game and i really wanna play it
Can it be on xbox
You should make it that that wall sensor thing also makes a sound, so that when the monster with extremely good hearing comes you have to put that thing away.
You should do a Russian HazMat suit for this game it would be quite cool
when that car was flying to me i was scared and i jumped
Honestly if you could manage to create the beast of lvl 5 it'd be incredible.  For example, you remove the hounds and skin stealers from the level (keep the moths in the boiler room), then you make so that a shadow could appear on paintings and if you look at it or go near it, then you'll have intense heartbeats, heavy breathing, visual effects that progressively blind you, sanity dropping very fast, and if you don't manage to run really far away from it, you character loses its sanity and dies
can you please add windows 7 i cant play it
Back rooms is popular games in escape the backrooms
Please fix characters shoulders,they just look weird
make it for free i cant get it so pls
The waffle house has found it’s new Host

Level 16 is to hard bro how to beat walluige in his underground bunker Bro                 jk
it has been three days and i still dont understand why people trash the game about being bad even though fancy is making the game all by himself and its updating A LOT if they think the game is bad then how about they make a game i am trying to work on one right now and its really hard but people still trash on fancy and again i dont understand why they do it
the waffle house has found a new host
This looks awesome, i think im gonna buy it
Is there going to be a story?
Make backrooms level 46 quicksand maze please
Can you add it to Mac?
You should make sprinting since that would make more suspense as well as increasing the speed of entities
The guy at the back is funny good
Well i dont think anyone would think this suggestion is good well you should add the "Game master" To your game and ask your discord what kind of minigames you could add for the entity. thats my idea i dont know if its good or not but the map could be similar to level fun with yellow walls and the floor would have like a checkerboard color and you may need a female voice actor if you wanna give the character a voice i would recommend doing it but its your choice well thats my idea and if you would like to add it for your next update well thanks alot for adding my idea to your game also nice video!
🤮🦇
Bro this game is crazy I downloaded it from the App Store and I love the blocky graphics the precedial generation, and  the music!
hey you may not see this but ( if you can ) make VR edition free ive wanted a backrooms vr game for a long time i dont like no clip because the map is the same
I wish there was a tutorial to show off how the stealth works and stuff
Very cool. I'd say another thing that would be cool would be making the animations for multiplayer smoother and just making them look better, as they feel really unpolished
funny idea, make it where there is a rare chance when you go insane to made it look like those weird-core pictures, with sparkles and text the don't make sense
Emotes
Can u make is for the oculus standalone???
Is it just me or does level 94 remind you of pepa pig

Can you put this on mobile and I want it to be free if that is fine with you
I remember that one of the deathmoth (female or male, don't remember) is not hostile.
I love this
I like the idea of like redesigning the hounds in erections to have like torn T-shirts or hoodies on them to represent that they were once human
You should add different variations of modulators different variations of my jelly dream of jelly orange monster like golden mouth jelly read mouth jelly
I learned a level that is ohio
Does everyone heard about ohio
Dude your game is sick!! Can't believe I've never seen your content.. awesome stuff. ❤🔥
Every level of this game is a better premise than anything Stephen King had written in the last two decades.
Can you make this game functional for mac?
VR horror Youtubers when he is  going to add vr support oh god pls no no noooooooo
this sounds like more cash grab, please work on multiplayer connection, tweaking the difficulty because fun =/= hard, and general quality over quantity, thank you.  I'll play the game once I'm convinced there's no more issues
I just want to say - you’re an incredible game developer. Wish you all the best
6:41 that looks like the stalker from HL2 and gmod.
Uh oh the order of ma version not accurate
I got your game and the garlic flying level bricked my 3ds! Fix your game 😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡
Ngl that party level took a while 💀
I think a cool level to add is level “69” no not because of the number but in a nutshell you get to it by sleeping in a car and waking up in a car it either being in good shape,bad ,or like my car and trust me you don’t want that…but the thing is there’s a monster resembling a giant spider in the sky and if you get out of the car you will be eliminated from spider leg and it could function as a mini game for a reward/item trying to drive a car with randomly generated stats (health and speed)  dodging entities you can feel free to research it on your own but that’s basically Level “69” in a nutshell
Join his discord or your gay
Vanoss is going to be happy
Also I subscribe
Hey buddy I have a idea their a level of the backroom called ohio look that one up I double dog dare you
Male moth are not aggressive Animations move like stop  motion Animated king looks like a big ball of light Animated king will bestow a challenge, refuse and be transformed into an animation, accept and you are transported in a room filled with your worst nightmare. Survive it and you can exit the level Also the castle is filled with guards that won't hurt you UNLESS you touch anything (and they see you doing so) Can't wait to play the game <3
just want to say your game is amazing, though I had a issue with screen recording it with nvidia. for some reason nvidia does not recognise that the game is in fullscreen so it ends up recording my desktop.
I miss him making jokes about how all entitys describe him
7:53 cs go?
How much does it cost
backrooms in ohio💀
you should add shrek, but make his sightings rare.. like most players won't ever see him.. just 0,0001% will, or so.
backrooms go brrrr!!
This is a good substitute to Dani, subscribed!
I sort of hate the wiki you’re using
e
ALMOND WATER
Almond water hmmm in other words nut juice
MAKE THE GAME FREE 😢😢😢
You should add a fear factor. If you have enough, you get a speed and stamina boost. You gain fear when around entities ind in “spooky” places.
This is the true impression of the GigaChad
Is it just me or does this look like a found footage 4:50
think you allready had the idea to make the shapeshifters mimic voice chat still think this would be an amazing idea especially if it used speach recognition and copied things like hey hello and where are you
Xbox version?
Dude i played your game with my  wirhout knowing you and every evening of the last couple days i have been screaming
But first what oculus is it gonna be on
What’s the VR game called
Will there ever be Xbox support
FANCY GET OTHER TO HELP YOU
Buying this game with hope for vr support in the future
can you add levels 8 9 and 15 please
Thought this was a film theory video
If you are planning to make the game available to playbin vr, willni be able to play on an oculus device, or do i have to own a valve index?
hello fansy, i noticed that you don't quite know the backrooms, because the animation king is what you imagine, if you think about a clown, then yes he is a clown
you should add settings where you can change keybinds and add sensivity setting
This game looks very nice but you share way too much of it and take out the surprise
you made the game too hard /:  but thats just my opinion.
Can u plz make this game free to play on all play stores? :)
make the game for Android alsow
Just beat the game after 27 hours, it’s very nice. I explored a ton but I wish there was a way to go back to level zero so I can find that escape door to the escape hub because I wanna get all of the possible doors, but for now I’ll have to start a new game. Fantastic job on level 6 I really loved the sonar glow dot mechanic. I didn’t understand how to get the elevator code after level 0 so i got it by trial and error eventually 😭. I wish the later levels were more challenging and i also wish there was more “randomness” it would make it more scary and for longer. like once you saw and understood the entity paths for some levels and where they spawn(especially the brick electrical room with the hounds)it was super easy. I mean the circuit breakers did spawn differently every time you die so that was random and challenging. The clown boss wasn’t hard at all you just gotta stay in one spot by the coaster and swing your mouse left and right (since there’s only two different directions he can get you) so you don’t get booty pounded until the coaster is ready. I completely understand that it’s early access and Its in fantastic condition and im super surprised with the amount you got done in a short amount of time with really no issues. One more thing, the fun room is a lil too easy and it’s also kinda short but thats pretty much it. Really good game, those were just some things I noticed. 👍
WHY DO THE MOTHS HAVE TO BUS
Idea: add some sort of story mode where you could work with M.E.G and explore the levels and make it more like the wiki
noice
That’s the animated king
thank you for doing, this its bine so long!!!!!!!!
Hi will this game come out for console one day?
Will this game be on mobile?
Sub too this dude
can you play this in vr?
how do u get to level fun because when i was in the tunnel , i went the way which said fun and the entity was there so i got killed every time
the truck scared me so badly
Give us guns
You need to have the backrooms level ohio
Fun fact you can tame male death moths with almond water and they're not as aggressive
It's not the word game you're so dumb the new one in the hope it's the best name is maybe escape the back room from The Munsters Hastings
I think it would be cool if there was a minecraft-server like system, where you could have a server with any amount of players join and the contents of each level save depending on how they are modified, which would be pretty cool. imagine hopping on a backrooms server with thousands of players like an MMO?
add kratos in backroom lawl
you should remove the buzzing and add Bird Flapping sfx like its more scarier  also male deathmoths are friendly if you feed them and you should add that!  Edit : make like max 2
Seu vídeo e muito ruim vc só falando desse jogo tinha que jogar não fala
Fancy makes the best steam games!
Where can I play the game?

Add the ocean
Can you make the password in the garage easyer
The Waffle House has found his new host.
Can you add a rare chance that some furniture in level 0 will spawn like drawers with random items Tables like in level fun so you can hide I don't know what else but I hope it will be added
Hey, why don't you add VR support? It feels like its a game that could take adventage of this device.

That death moth got some honkers icl
I recommend giving the entity hoard in level ! a jumpscare
Is this realesed yet if so what is the name
Super work so far, love the idea of the game and the premise of it. You've done massive work keep it up!
Got the game. Highly recommend
What about android i mean on phone
ADD LEVEL 10
i wish the game portrayed to mobile lol ik this is stupid idea but some people doesn't have a time to play pc games... when doing a business in the bathroom
No-clipping is an important part of the back rooms. Maybe make it so that if you hug the wall for long enough in a certain area, there may be a chance for you to teleport to another level.
Will u guys add escapr thr backrooms mobile? I  don't want to play apk
The work that goes into the animation for the videos is hilarious. Very well done
Try to make people to hide under beds
I wish he would add the game on playstore
The Waffle House has found its new host
I may only recommend looking into some 'maze generation algorithms' which are often used for procedural generation of indoor spaces in games, and would be especially a good fit for Level 0 ^.^
People to do different things have different children they spawn in
It would be cool if the final level was something related to Async or trying to stop Async from doing more damage to the earth by closing the portal or something, it could be a fun recon mission and a nice end to the game, there could also be different endings based on what you do
the waffle house has found its new host
If you are a gaming lover, especially the metaverse game trend, don't miss the THE MERA project! It's well worth looking into
Add survivor mode 😫😫😫👍🏻
I remember hearing it in another backrooms video that this game will be free (once it's out). I hope you haven't changed your mind about that
3:31 💀
Is it already released?
Notes male deathmoths is friendly the Wikipedia says for the female deathmoths
I advise you to add multiplayer in the future so it will be more interesting to play with friends

You shoud add the item in the real Life backroom Called a Lightning in a bothel which is a one time Use wapon. Thats stunts entitys

And also I added female Deathmoths, which is the same thing but bigger.  1 sec later: EAAAALP HEEEELLLLP HEEEEEEELLLLLLLPPPPPPPP!!!!!!!!!
Hub PC's are broken, most of the levels just show level 0 text and only the host can see all of them, joining players can only see 0 , 1 and Gate.exe
Female moths uh?

When you add VR support, can you try getting it to the Oculus Quest 2? Thanks!
Do you ever think this game would get a console release because I play on xd box and I don’t have a PC and this game looks awesome to play with friends.    P.S. you are doing very great on this game end I really hope this becomes a top selling game 😊
You should add a smiler in level 6
Is vr?
As soon as you said ''VR support'' I bought the game as soon as possible, Very exited so keep up the good work!🙂

instead of the animations and animation king looking like Pinocchio and bubbles the clown, I would actually like to see them as poorly sketched out models that would look like something a kid would draw. from the lines overlapping inside and outside the body to half-erased mistakes. it would be cool to see something like that.
Aren't male death moths friendly
Me waiting for the big update so I can buy it and scream with my fiends: Upload date 5 days ago AGH
Just look at how far he's come
*reaches end of game* BASED OFF OF A REAL STORY
Is the game out on mobile cause if it is you just won 100000 dollar check
let us customize our avators plz
The Waffle House has found its new host
@Broogli Go to his channel You can learn more about the back rooms and you can add His custom level 0hi0.
no no resub resub
HES BACK I KNEW HE WOULD COME BACK WHEN WE NEEDED HIM
Hey fancy you forgot to change the model for the smiler in pipe dreams it’s the same spider-like model
Again, why are you adding all the other levels? The lore is fucking garbage. This has nothing to do with backrooms anymore.
im unsubbing because no frowners and freindly endtitys from backrooms
this guy a gigachad
It would be so scary if you added Vr lol😂
Please make it to where you can play on mobile
Can you add the negative levels? Bike level -0It's basically just level 0 but very glitchy.
"My maps can be measured in inches" well technically-
When escape the backrooms addedmobile devices
Only male death Moths can be tamed The female ones actually attack. You can change them with almond water.
Level 7 would be scary...   Also, can you add Level 6.1?
Do you have an estimated release date for the procedurally generated level zero ?   I just try the game, it’s very cool thanks for your work 👍👍👍
The whaffle house has found it's new host
thank you for making a good game and taking your time to try to fix or find glitches. Also thank you for not over pricing the game $10 is perfect so big thanks on that part. cant wait too see what you will add next.

Kratos would survive The Backrooms
Love the flying truck😂
The Waffle House has found his new host.
I love your dedication I refunded this game months ago but now I’m definitely re buying it since it’s getting this much love and updates
Keep going man in level5
WHERE is besnis man
Are you planning to add the red knight as a super rare encounter? Or is that a no cause that would also be perfectly understandable considering what the red knight is.
can we play on mac
Can’t wait for vr support ❤❤
Where can I get this game? Is it on Xbox by chance? Or do I need to download it on IOS
VR
This is extremely dope I gotta check this out again💯🔥
Common W Update
buff party goer
Bro..until now, the game was kinda chill, with a lot of pretty nice jumpscares, and overall making my heart rate go to 999 bps. BUT NOW YOUR TELLING ME HE MADE IT VR SUPPORTED? AINT NO WAY IM PLAYING FOR LONGER THAN 5 MINUTS
Ad level 63
what would happen if mario did a blj in the backrooms like imagin being there and hearing YAHOO slowly get louder and louder
Thumbnail is underwhelming thanks to the Hazmat suit guy
Make your game support mac
I love that he keeps updating “Escape from backrooms” game but a lot of the new things added from moth jelly to sanity look ripped and and after thought bc of the other steam game “inside the backrooms”
@8bitryan PLEASE PLAY THIS
all fun and game till you take off that vr headset and nothing changes
Why is your steam game money
You should add an SCP as a boss if that’s part of the game , they would make really good entities to make the game actually hard
the waffle house has found its new host
Will it soon be expanded to xbox or just stay on pc?
add a gun
u know fancy that infinite played ur game btw
PLEASE ADD VR
this game is a "dream" come true!
What about mobile support
The only thing missing is the inter game virus, that hijacks other games, auto booting the back rooms and noclip that character into an unwanted visit.
Can you put it on the oculus store

This looks awesome! Graphics and gameplay is spot on Just please, *please* don't end up creating a child like "" "" "horror" "" "*&_&" game. (like poppy p, security breach etc), please. This has so much potential.
Hey! I got a video for all the entities! You can maybe use it! https://youtu.be/LsiFulxB5Kk
You need to make this available for vr, all we got for backrooms is noclip vr
Can't wait for Vanoss to play this
i wonder if we could play a game in the future that is as realistic as jared pike's renders and at least as interesting as your concepts
cool!
Thank you for adding a lidar scanner. I love those things so much and they deserve alot more horror content using them.
Waited a Long Time for this video
Hi really a good game please update the keybinds with a azerty keyboard we can't play
Id buy it if wasnt broke looks fucking sick
Here's an idea  Make partygoers sing Daisybell
how do i go to the old version
Fancy you should really make my favourite character and level 240 class difficulty is 1 my favourite character is lotka and the level is called lotka lake lotka come from under water and they are not hostile if you hit it it will kill you back they are very important lotka makes apple trees and almond water so you could survive watch out though because a fog will come and you might fall in the lake and then die
I just can’t wait for Level 0 update, I think the the most iconic level, it should be very long and endless, can’t wait to see it updated.  For the moment this level is really short, i find that level 0 should really have the feeling to be lost and alone, in my eyes it is the most terrifying... Only the sound of wet carpet and vibrating neon lights 😱
So it’s free to play? But cost 10$
first time seeing this, after reading the title im like, “hm, that sounds..” then i read the channel name and im like “..Fancy”
Wow, I believe in you!
I need this in vr
3:31 LEGIT GOT JUMPSCARED WTF hbHjbjkhabhkuabsbdhlj
This is absolutely dope dude.   in order to fill my portfolio I would like to make visuals for your game. I don't  need money just the possibility to add the visual in my portfolio but I will add you in the credits and would help me to in my career. I'm a junior graphic designer.
Dude! I downloaded your game on my Nokia N-gage and the entities jumped out of the screen and started calling me a loser! Then they ate my mother pissed on my carpet and left. Fix your game!
3:31 Truck jumpscare
Love the game but please add an FOV slider bro, i get really bad motion sickness from this game
8:48 Ah yes flying pig
Game is so fun
you should change almond water to sanity soda
I wont to play this game on my Xbox
The way you present the video, the transparency on your work, i think it's great. I'm buying your game tonight to follow the development and to explore the backrooms. i can't wait to see what will happen next. keep it up !! Bravo.

Will it be available on the oculus quest 2????
Is it on Mac?
Are you sure those moths just don’t want a hug?
Day 4 of asking Fancy to add level you cheated
Heeeey ... Me and my friends love your game. but. pls. Add your videos to your updates.. THE DOOR WITH THE HIVE ROOM WOULD HAVE BEEN A VERY GOOD SPOILER I MIGHT HAVE NEEDED
Add VR support change animations of main characters/char it self and i am in! :D
Can you please make a mobile version to please I'll do anything
Make it vr pls
I love this game please don’t forget it
i wonder what the intro song was, but im actually impressed how good the game is besides from bugs!
I hope you can actually put a lamp head on your head and hide using that
Imma install it and prob never play it since im a wuss
i was the 1 milion view
Fancy,can you make Bacterias(level 0 entity) more dangerous? Becouse.. ughhh... just make them more dangerious (Bacterias and Partygoers can noclip to every level,so they can be found in other levels(not including Kitty's House) and also,Bacterias attack Skin Stealers,Smilers and Partygoers(usually Bacteria wins),so can you make that Bacteria can noclip(spawn) in every level ,but on level Fun... something like very rare "Bacteria vs Partygoers war",ya,not "Bacterias" just one strange black guy can end whole level(yes Bacteria is even stronger than some *boss* entities),and thats how "Party End" begins. As i know,it's not a real thing,the war of Partgoers vs Bacteria doesn't exist but there is something like "Dead Fun Level"(it's probably not this level's name) in Backrooms, that level have,ughhh.... nothing.. but nothing isn't cool so maybe Bacteria will be only guy in here,and also there need to be a LOT of Partygoer corpses) and please,add *PartyHosts*(it's a BOSS of Partygoers that looks like a cake with a giant eyeball on it,PartyHosts can be found ONLY in level Fun)*Partypoopers*(its a tall man(taller than a normal adult human) with a black jacket,black gloves,and a blue mask with sad face,they will help every wanderer by giving every usefull item in game,killing Partygoers and other entities,and also helping to find the exit on every level,yes,yes,yes,they are so OP but first:they CAN also be killed,second:they are VERY RARE,becouse they loose in Fun War(Partypoopers vs Partygoers) they can be found on every level) and *Bone Thieves*(potato-like yellow creature with open mouth with no teeth and 2 eyes inside,it also have to fake-black eyes,those are more like *showers* but to *wash* them selfs,instead of water,Bone Thieves use slimy liquid that,really,do clean it's skin,Bone Thieves *steal* bones of everyone they looking at(only if it's not the thing that doesn't have bones,like Bacterias and maybe Smilers,those are immortal to him,but anyways they don't attack each other)the bones of it's prey disappears,and then Bone Thieve eats no-bone body,they can be find in every level)
Male deathmoths are not deadly in the wiki and broogli’s video
Im not gonna lie, Deathmoth looks cute
Make it multiplayer
Day 1 of asking for a blazer a blazer is a flash grenade that so powerful it can Take out a hoard of smilers and a strober a pulsing flashlight made for the Backrooms It can stun entities since it beam strong
Yay another backroom game…
Oh hell yeah, after this done it should become MMO. I am not sure when it can be done 🥲
Hey man, this takes a LOT of effort and you have worked on a LOT of stuff. Props to you.
Add Hugr multiplayer mode with Clans that has a base in some levels
content for backrooms kiddies
Actually A very cool game and yeah
The truck scared the he’ll out of me 😂😂😂😂
finished the game today after the new update with a couple of my buddies and its an entirely new came in the best possible way. keep it up man.
Are you going to make it for controller users or no
Pls make ur game free
I think u can add level "you cheated" for cheaters
I would love to play that but i dont have good pc or monry to buy pc

HOW AM I LATE!!
God of the backrooom
What about console?
what video game making software do you use
Is there copyright On the backrooms I would rather him not lose everything in a lawsuit
this game sounds amazing, i will definitely buy it! (as long as I can run it and it's not 100 dollars lmao)
Male death moths olny attack if you aggravate them but they mostly pretty chill
By the way the animated king is kinda like partygoers + partypartypoopers
When i first saw the game on steam, i knew it had great potential. Glad to see this keep up the great work
A Negative levels
Level 999999
1:20
new smitty episode soon???? @smi77y
1:21 bro got jumped by the entities
Hey @Fancy can you please make this game available on ps4
I love the kids on youtube who feel the need to comment shit like "wElL i goT tO this LevEl and UmMMm therE'S thIS pIg tHaT flIeS and DoeSnT sAve MY pRogRESs so yeaAh uMm fIx ur Freaking gaME oMg i uNsuBscribeD oMg"
u should have named it fancy’s backrooms
you should definitely change the character’s avatar because that radiation suit doesnt conduct electricity since its made from rubber so it wouldnt make sense for you to die when touching the electric water thing
im not sure if there's a "peaceful" mode with no entities, but if not, please add one! i would like to explore each level without having the fear of being attacked or having to run away from anything. just pure loneliness (which would be scarier in real life, in my opinion)
Can't you make your character smaller and the map smaller to make your map very huge?
Yo can i be tester?
Oh shit that truck scared TF out of me
I had a bug in the hotel level running through the hotel rooms where I hid in the closet but the shapeshifting creature was stuck right infront of the closet door and i had no choice but to let it kill me. He just did not want to leave the spot and there was nothing blocking him.
It's Ohio
this is a hard idea and you will never do this but im just suggesting just in case. Could you add VR support on applab and such. That would be really cool and vr backrooms are the beset backrooms games you can find.
Yo, I'm from Brazil and I would like to say that the game really seems incredible in matters of gameplays and mechanics, unfortunately I have no money to buy the game and I'm using a translator to write this comment XD
Mr.Fancy, I know you said no to guns but I think there should be so sort of stun dart or taser or something kind of like that, also it should stun them for about 15 seconds.
so for the vr part would you need a computer to play it or will it be like applab or on the oculus store
game is broken              alot
The "oh shiiiii-" got me lol
add a m1911
You should add vr mode
i love this game but there is a game coming out called subliminal and its prob gona be the best backrooms game ever
5:20 The Hub (;
Me and my friend had such a fun time playing this game together, we played for like a straight six hours, thank you so much for giving us and everyone else such a great experience, keep up the work broski
Bro thanks for making this game it super cool Ngl
Delete monsters from lvl 3 or make lvl easier PLEASE
Truck jumpscare be like 3:31
Add to consoles lol
Please make this for xbox
it would be cool if we could have character customization, also i love your game keep up the good work 👍
Would you ever think of making a vr mode?
I'm not like monsters on electric stations
Wow. Just wow.
Cute moths
When's it coming to vr
Cool video ❤
Backrooms level 0.00069 exists lol
make a siren head easter eggg
Pls gimme game for free xoxo steam user is El Macho, Friend code: 466885871. thanks hahah
I cant wait for this game to be finished 👌🥳
Man I love your videos but can you make level 974
In level 4 the windows that haven’t been blacked out are considered traps and an entity will pull you out of them and no one knows what happens to you after that. Maybe you should add those entities
You are the only one that is afraid of clowns clowns creep me out I don’t like them if I had an eagle and I could shoot one clown I will do it
I didn't even realize this was the backrooms game I've played before until I finished the video, can't wait to see the updates in game. This game is and has been by far the best backrooms game in my opinion.
Is game playable? looks incredibly fun
Will this gam ever be released on consoles?
Can u add the white tripod?
The waffle house has found its nw host
Is the game paid for because it's early development coz in the first episode you made you said it would be free
but like why so many entities or monsters
i need to know if this guys uses the wikidot or *pukes* the the fandom page *pukes*
7:18 "0. mcdonalds sign" idk why but that got me good 🤣

3:24 level 94 is giving me some serious cat in the hat vibes
I really hope I get to play your game soon. Currently I have no money and that won’t change for a while 🥲
For level 6, I think it would improve immersion if you could make the first-person character model dark like the rest of the level and only have the light from the radar occasionally illuminating your arms. Awesome progress so far as well 👍🏻 I can't wait to see what this game will look like when complete.
I want to say something did you know that you can actually tame the male deathmoths
In the comments of one of your other videos I noticed that a lot of people mix up your game with Inside the Backrooms
What was that hive that was Like inside me gut but this vid is 👍👏
I already subbed to you sooo,,,,
I feel like you should add a player that spawns in as a partygoer and they also can no clip any time and could you add RUN FOR YOUR LIFE!
Will there be phone support?
Where do I play this ?
Add to console pls
damn this looks amazing
Make it in vr
Trying to make something other then the same thumbnail..
Imagine going into the boiler room I would be like “aww hell nahh”💀
Bro this game actually looks amazing now, very rare to see a Backrooms game with such detail and effort considering everyone else rushed their games when the Backrooms was really popular
The animated king is actually like a medieval king, with a crown. It’s not like a clown. That’s just a suggestion, you don’t have to add it but that’s what the animated king actually looks like/is
In the last video you said that you would change the party goers look but I think you should keep the old look but make it more realistic
(sips tea)

Did I just get jump scared by a flying truck..this game is Amazing
can you add customisation I just kinda wanna look cool

LeveI 8
0:45 Oooh, noice!
this game runs fine til ultra settings lmao, is it possible to run max settings without even lagging as of rn, im on a rtx 2060
I got the game on release and i didn't think it was that good compared to inside the backrooms
You should make level 0hi0
What’s the game called
Make level 69 Fancy.    Explanation: Level 69 looks like a dark and empty infinite highway that has fog rolling at all times. Each side of the highway has massive concrete walls that seem to be infinite in height. There's literally nothing else like it here. The level is apparently so dangerous that when you spawn in you have to stay in the car.   If you want to know more go to Broogli video.
Me and my friends have recently played and finished the game for the most recent update. i gotta say the dark room area is so damn unique we were all very impressed with it, absoloute top teir stuff. More mechanics like this and you will be going places. Loved everything so far.  Only 2 things to mention, the bug area, some of the rooms do not show the heat for the bugs. and the yellow bloon guys are kinda buggy sometimes. Thats really the only criticism i have to be honest.
The Waffle House has found its new host
Now I just wait for smi7ty to make a vid about the game again
Do  you actually have permission to use the name Backrooms for your game? It's cool that you are making a game of an existing series, but you are charging money for it, so you kind of stealing income from the original creator by using their IP.  If so then all good! If not please watch out for a lawsuit or change the name of the game.
Technically speaking if a bug happens you don't need to fix it
You should add an intro to the game where you're in the real world and you no clip
And apps
For Android
Are you making any games for phone
I paid for this on my Xbox and after I did then it told me I couldn’t play it and I never got a refund :(
You should add a level select and every level you beat gets added to the Level Select
i wish the game was free when it first released for the first few days or smth
How does this guy not have 100m subscribers

What type of vr are we talking I am hoping quest 2 I think I will have fun making my friends scream. I also share this vid to them keep up the good work.
We’re do I play?
I hope he gets enough funding and continues this project for a long time, it would be so cool to see a game based around The Backrooms that has hundreds of levels you can explore with friends, some levels are simple and fun to walk around in, some not so much. Only issue I have with these games SO far is I finish them so quickly with friends and we all want it to continue
YES

Never thought I’d get jump scared by a flying truck
holy fuck instant purchase
damn son
I don' t really like the puzzel change to the game here.
you should open a patron, id support
Could you please add 1930s lounge music to level 5, like Al Bowlly?
Brooo that's mind blowing I can't wait to play the game (I don't have comp) so when I will have computer the game is going to be completed xd
the dogs smell
I dont like the model you used for the kind, that model is used in a LOT of mobile "horror" games. Also the king is a dark figure of pitch black, with a single eye on its face. it has rings surrounding its body, also there's different types of animations, one of them being figures made of clay, Wich suffocate you with there bodies.
Best steam dev 💯
about the home and hilly level.  In my opinion I liked it when it was just homes and hills, gives it a creepy old computer vibe while the new one…. Doesn’t really give off much dread.

Can you make the mystery flesh pit national park into a game
mr.kitty is homeless,still.
Lol that intro
Hey fancy long time no see
U Should Make It VR When u Can
Level 5 looks like The Hotel in the shining. Thats what scares me
I love how you just treat the backrooms like its no big deal.
I would be happy if some of the content was a bit more, "unique" because the almond water and moth jelly from a different game called inside the backrooms. Which My friends and I loved. :/
I could barely get through Halv Life Alyx im not going to be able to play this in VR

Looks like...........waffle house has found its new host
i love how accurate the game is. this is by far the best backrooms game
LiDAR scanner should only light up the walls on its own screen to make this even more immersive
over all i love this game i want to devolop games as well but don't know how
3:25
3:00000
some dramatic scenes animations some graphics you know
I think the skin takers should at more you know normal as if it's pertending not just running and should have a chance in every level but very small chance
level 1,000 is so pose to be good
You should be able to tame a male deathmoth
Would be nice for an exploring mode : No Damage you can be one entitie choose a room to start etc..
I think there's a bug with the dogs you shine light but they still get you
I love how it’s not on the App Store in quest😐
Vr support will be amazing
Male Deathmoths are actually pretty docile and can even be tamed, which is pretty cool. But I understand why that mechanic doesn’t exist in-game. I hope this game becomes successful dude! It’s very cool
If you do eventually make a be version please try your best to put it on the stand alone oculus maybe with out procedural generation
I mean pls
Plus make the game in vr
Game?      |     \/
1 minute befor i saw this video i add thi game to my wishlist
This games gonna start looking like doom eternal 10/10
please release it for mac.
For Proximinity chat you should code it to where the entities can hear you

I suggest mobile and console gameplays, since I really like this game and want to try it but my pc is so trash so if there is a chance you can add a mobile or console gameplay. It would be so amazing if you can add it.
the waffle house had found its new hot
This is so fucking cool dude! I just have one little suggestion for you actually. Male deathmoths arn't actually dangerous, they're the size of a large dinner plate and can even be tamed! It's the females that are extremely dangerous as they can get HUGE, like really huge, and can spit acid.
you know what you should add? you should add building into the game so you can make shelters and what not, i also think that there should be a way to brake walls if you do add bulding
Please mobile
Public game to phone plsss
one thing. Why is the howlers snout. SOOOO long? he literally walkin into walls. i think it should be smaller

Quick question, when is vr support coming out? You mentioned it in the video but never really gave a us a time period or anything. It’s fine if you can’t answer right now but I think all of the oculus players would appreciate atleast a certain time period of around when it’s supposed to come out. Thank you
Btw NOT MAKING YOU DO THIS the males can be tamed with food you can make it so you have A CHANCE to get food
Make it free

aw hell naw
i lost my progress because of you cause you update somehow
Yay! I've been waiting for a new video :)
You should’ve added level 666
He forgot to mention that the lights turn off on the Level: The End.
Fancy i got the BEST IDEA. What if you can unlock cosmetics like backpacks for an ingame currency which you get for completing daily challenges… I mean this would change the game by this much 📈📈📈
I wanna see Vanoss play this new update 😂

I love your videos they are so good and the game seems so cool, in level 94 did you know the castle is actually on a transparent mountain or seems to be, I still like the way you choose to enter the castle but I still felt like putting this comment in.
Doesn’t the hotel level remind you of roblox doors
Is was fun to play local Co-op
OMG IM BUYING IT RIGHT NOW THATS AMAZING
wait is the game free?
Weres the guns to fight the King so add this add robo men that walk near you and kill you add levers the damage the king and kill the robo men
You should add a scared meter to raise it you have to get jump scared to lower the meter you have to to find a cat
You should add a stun gun that can stun any entity but it only has 3 charges Plz add this Fancy or I will kidnap you😂
You should give the Animated King a crown and a classic cartoon king cape
the Beverly room is a room with mannequins in it and music playing that slowly drives you insane you could make the room and make it slowly removes your health
Now this man could host the waffle house
I like how lore friendly he is making the game
Will this game be console I really wanna play it keep going your doing great
3:33 warning. Truck jumpscare!
Vanoss is gonna love this maybe
Keep the player model it makes the entities run from you
Day 3 of asking Fancy to add level you cheated
please say that you can cover yourself with the jelly because you will be smelling the giant insects and you can pass through them
What is his discord server
You could do split screen game that would be awesome.
This is the best game I’ve heard of recently

You should add a mechanic with a creature that uses that uses your mike to find you and trap you.
The best moment about procedual generation of Backroom levels is that even if it get weird or empty at one point it'll only be great for the entire liminal thing
Hey mate how about you will make lite version of your game for that players that has no money? Just like geometry dash on phone
Fix LV fun it's already impossible
idk why but you are making me motivated to make backroom in unity.this could be my first project on unity .
Do you wet and poop when making deathmoths?
You gotta put the beast who resides on the 5th floor in the game!!
Seeing that there’s now some updates is making meh happy- The effort that this guy puts on his game. Like fr I can’t even make a single game but this guy did it! The fact that it looks very good, the models, the Levels, This guy nailed it.

The favorite level for me is level five especially the boiler room your already have the tension of the entities but also the tension of the hot temperatures.
I love this so much and dreamt about it for a while! I might actually buy this and give it a try while supporting u in the same way:D I really hope this goes to many places, levels and THINGS it looks so promising!
I have an idea you can put like prison level where if you need to escape you need to un clogg a toilet which open a secret room in the wardens office while the warden is hunting you  The warden is an extremely gooey creature who can turn into slime and it can also access the vents above you and grab you from the above so you need to make no sound when you hear some liquidey thing moving also it can solidify and take on the shape of a man    You also need to find the clogged toilet you can just follow the water coming out of it  The warden have very low intelligence if you don't move while you encounter it it will go it's own way but of it's see you better run

I like that what the whole valve team would be working in 2009 3 years, this guy makes it even under 1 year
bro when will you add level kitty, ive been waiting for that level
Level 6 is kinda wrong since you copied level blackout.
Hey Fancy! I think it would be the coolest thing if in level 94 there would be a rare chance of seeing a person call from the sky like they just noclipped. You could also add something like that in all the other levels like someone helping "hello!?" or evidence of a small human base. Also please put this game on vr? It would be awesome? Another thing I really like your videos, keep it up!
Hi
Should be on xbox 😂
Oh nvm
Can you realese on ps4
Can you please make it avaible for vr?
Vr support pls
This is gonna be BIG in the future. Like not size big, like so many people are gonna be playing this big. I can just tell.
VR SUPPORT?! once this game comes out on oculus, I’m downloading it instantly because this game is an absolute masterpiece.
Suggestion: add  MEG outposts which will basically be outposts located throughout levels  which have plenty of resources and friendly MEG operators, citizens etc which will be a once-in a while reliever throughout all the stress in the backrooms.
Your approach to bringing life to the Backrooms lore makes it more enjoyable to me. I hope the best for your game development!
At 6:32 the first time i saw those things idk why but my soul literally left my body because if scared me so bad and also i was looking at that at 1 am and the lights cut off so ye thats why prob :p

Will this game come to consoles as well?
I really like the night vision effect. The dots on the walls n that. I think it’s a really original way to do night vision.
Is there a version of the game for Android?
I would play the game but... It aint free to play ;-;

Bro what was that comment talking about "pig flies"
Me when I see fancy upload he's backrooms video: 😃😃😃
hey, fancy I love your videos in fact you are the reason I started playing Minecraft again just to build the backrooms.
Thats what ive been waiting for 😍
You should make it free
Will this game be native on quest 2 via app lab or sodequest? When it does release on vr at least
Add mobile support!
Add moral support
I love this game but I always die from the I Animated king
Death moth a moth that gives u death
Bro is literally solo destroying every game company 💀
You know the levels origin and memories right? If so then please make those two levels in your backroom game
1:11 hehe wetard wun
The animated king looks like the king from the cards you see in solitare, thats the best reference image i can find only.
Ahh yes the most dangerous entity a flying truck
You should add some light bait for the moths to bait them and make a run or throw flashlight feature
Finally a sanity meter, something i was hoping to be adapted into a backrooms game
It would be fun if the mcdonalds is like the backrooms bar just see the entity that tried to kill you just chilling next to you leaving you alone
Fancy will you attempt to add console support eventually? I wanna play it on ps5

I don't mean to sound like a Karen but i feel like the scanning device should be replaced by thermal vision goggles cmon how would you find that in the backrooms it's not official and also I feel like that would be way ahead of it's time
@Fancy, You know those idiots, wandering in the dark, I will neither confirm nor deny the information relating that it may or may not have taken myself and 3 of my friends and hour to complete said darkness level.
Add Transformer.it's transform into other entities
Can i play this game with my friends ? Pls add something funny
Would it be bad if he added weapons/attack items in the game.  Like the spray gun,liquid pain,absolute pain,etc.
You should make the game start off as a character in the normal world just going to work or something and then no clipping and being on level 0
Finaly ive been waiting for months
6:26 I thought they were called Insanities? Or were they always Wretches?

I love you fancy, but please dont ever pull a dani and disappear
I have ptsd when I see someone smiling at me
With those moths, When they are chasing you, you should make it that if you have a flashlight, If you throw the flashlight while it’s on, it will distract the moth.
Idea: After drinking too much almond water (RNG:5-7) you teleport to the breakroom which is where the entities chill and watch tv
hi ]  \
Do the male death moths all have a mommy kink or some shit
Yo you shold make it when you lose your sanity and you die it spawns a wretch which is an entity created my people who lost their sanity
This is vr would probably give me a heart attack
you should add music to level ! pls do it
PLS MAKE IT MOBILE
You should add a PVP hide and seek
Can you add condole support in the future when your finished? (Just so you know I'm not rushing you)
Delete bacteria for more realistic backroom game🙂🙂 i hop u add entity 666 boss fight in level the end💀💀💀💀💀
Can you allow your game on macOS? I bought your game on my Mac, and I can’t play it, please do it.
I can’t wait for vr support
Hey, I have a request, can you have add a survivor named “Mr. Bob”? It’s my friends nickname and I would love to see his reaction if it gets added. (no pressure.)
This game looks interesting, I'll probably get it when I get back to my house
You have to put it on side quest
Add guns

Actually females are the aggressive ones, males are harmless (mostly). It's a minor mistake though, so it not to frustrating, I just wanted to let you know.
giver me asd  team keyas
Hmmm in the level 94 it doesn’t hace day-night cycle, it inmediatly turns pitch black. I think you should add a timer in the corner of the screen when the timer is on 0:00 the level inmediatly turns pitch black
Level suggestion: Level 188 in which the player would need to complete puzzles in order to enter into the correct window aka trial and error
Face reveal face reveal face reveal face reveal face
Suggestion: People that die from sanity loss in multiplayer become wretches.
How many levels does the game have so far?
The wafle house has found its new host
Yo, just bought your game on steam using the link. Love your content man!
Bro I know the vr support is gonna be scary

Big request but is there any way for you to get this game on consoles and still have VR supported. Other than that congratulations on making such a great game. Can’t wait to see the new hazmat suit model 😊
The Waffle House has found its new host
Idea: make it VR supported, so that it will be super scary. And there’s not that many back rooms games that are scary.
The Waffle House has found it's new host.
Hey can someone pitch idea that in multiplayer you can meet random people  from all over internet?? i think it would make just better Backroom experience

After you manage procedural generation i would suggest the level 3 or 5, don't recall, the caves which are accessible by the underwater pipes in the pool rooms, differently from the pools the caves have fish, mostly bad fish and leeches, also, the pipe rooms seem too wide if it is like this video, anyway, good luck, if the game is good i will play it... and don't forget to add story later on, everyone likes finding pieces of paper with horrible stories about the fate of people that have gone there
Hey fancy will the vr support version be free too?
alr nice
The Waffle House Has Found Its New Host
idk about u but 3:31 is the scariest part of this video
you can add more scaries sh-t to level RUN FOR YOU LIVE ? like a:skin stealer,hounds,death moyhs and howers
bought the game today with my friends it was so fun the skin stealers are scary  but fun
I think that there should be a sort of character system, where you can level up your researcher depending on how many achievements you have.  You could become the researcher shown at 8:30 as the final and best skin.

what is the game about? srry for deleting comment
It takes some dam skill to make a game,much respect,all day I was binge watching your vids while drawing,amazing game.
The Waffle House has found it’s new host
I have an idea for 2 easter eggs,  1. In level 2 you could add a secret light head at the end of the hallway, (It wont move are kill you, its just there for looks.) 2. In a corner, in level 1. You could add the "cute" baby smiler somewhere, That's all for now, I hope you add these!

Can’t sub :(
Can you make a Cartoon Cat Horror game or Just a Cartoon Horror game?
Wait... I just realized, How do the people in the backrooms post the pictures on the internet if they have no reception??
wait, 120 degrees is the overheating temp? time to leave southern Utah I guess
Damn, he's working with unreal. Just made a small backrooms vr game demo with unity, would have loved to give input
Fun fact: wretches are humans so maybe if the players or a friend looses all of their sanity they die  and a npc wretches replace them.
Here's some stuff you could make Kitty Ronald mc Donald and mc donalds You cheated Gun Flare Night vision (attracts entity's but atleat you can see) Knife A sniffer dog that is in lvl 0 and is lost Water energy and food bar Dog treats  And Kitty's level
Out of everything in this video, I got scared by a truck
At 8:43 it says the game will free to play but its not. When will it be free to play?
I think ur forgetting the main point which is backrooms levels are not very horror focused rather its the uncanny feeling that makes it special, Adding better camera effects like The Complex:Found Footage is also a good toutch

the deathmoth model is amazing!
I always tought when watching videos about the backrooms. "Why isn't anyone making a proper big game about this?". But you did this, you made this masterpiece of a game and i really appriciate you or this. Keep up the great work.
this guy reminds me of @Dani
Add this game to GeForcenow or boosteroid
Truck: weeeeeeeee 3:34
you're based asf
Can you make it standalone on the meta quest 2
Finnaly more of this
im so excited
That flying truck is like an entity of its own, i love it
when he says dont do, you definitely have to do it lol
I actually think it'd be better to give the animation entities unique, well, animations! Maybe some of them have different frame rates [ like clay and puppet animations look more choppy, 2d ones that kind of work like those nextbots, and 3d ones that basically work like the ones shown in the video ]
The Waffle House Has Found Its New Host
I know you don't want to ad guns to the game but could you add melee weapons
I thought male deathmoths were safe
can we just take a second to think about how much this game took he took his heart and soul to make this game and he makes it somehow better and better everytime

You gotta add Level 1.5. It's a level that has a chance system where you try to get to the bottom level while going through doors in which you don't know what's behind them.

Can you add level 7?
Because a worker wouldn't be alone in the backrooms, I think singleplayer should be someone that fell in. This also solves a problem were you kinda just fade into the middle of the backrooms when you start the game. You can have it so when you start single player it starts with the camera falling in from the ceiling and then being picked up while the multiplayer can have a physical lobby/waiting room rather than the menu waiting room. This waiting room could be the laboratory with a door into the backrooms that opens when the host starts or the lobby votes on it and closes behind you.
The Waffle House Has Found It's New Host
My main 2 questions are would there ever be console support and will you be able to play on oculus

impressive work man ! i haven't found a game with this high level of creativity keep it up !  also can i request a backroom level ? level 9999 aka judgment island its a really cool scray level but many people don't  know about it
Massive
Aw man I'm still trapped on level fun how am I supposed to get to the new levels 🥲
Me and my friends finished it yesterday, and it was pretty fun, the only issue was the insanity. I understand it's an incentive to keep exploring, but when there's 4 people, levels like the hotel get really bogged down just because the insanity decrease is insane. It turned it from tense to just going door to door trying not to get annoyed. Another thing I want to see more of is the monster that acts like an explorer. I think it'd be cool if he didn't immediately turn into entity form, and tries to fool you a bit more.
this might be one of the best backrooms games ever! ❤
Could you add level 998, it’s called zenith and it would look perfect in the game!

Ah yes the game that broke speedrunning for the speedrunner nerds 😂😂😂 bought time we cant speedrun a game  Edit: baby and male deathmoths are actually very friendly but the females shoot acid at you and are extremely agressive, also u can tame baby ones if you have the right stuff!
I love this game, because I got scared on the 2nd level
As someone who is stuck in the back rooms I can say this is very accurate
Can't wait for that vr support.
I cant wait when you add this to vr it will be even more scary then it is already
You should make it so it lays eggs and it could be females or males that have a full life cycle, also old age they can’t fly. Can you do that? Can you add Xbox support? I don’t know if you mentioned that at all
I would love to see this game as a story survival game where you can find loenly bases from other survivors and items on the map and bandit groups. Kind of like a mix between rust and minecraft. I hope you can do that anytime because there are lots of escaping the backrooms games but none survive the backrooms games.
I have an idea mobil support hut if that cant happen then make the game on mobile Low quality as possible

you mfs are killing the backrooms
Pls do this game in mobile
Brah heres a idea:instead of giving smiler  Things on your screen when sanity is down you should add levels of sanity where if your sanity drops to stage 1 you sart to hear strange sounds and stage 2 sounds + the whole vision gets dark and a entity you cant see apears with glowing eyes that will hunt da player down(after catching u it will drain your sanity a bit more,da entity can be avoided a bit easily Stage 3:the sounds of entities and strange things + player vision gets dark and the entitie from stage 2 hunts u down + scary images (eg:jack the killer photo) flashes  in the screen at random moments
if you add vr pls do that you also can play it on HTC VIVE or other ones

You NEED to try to get this on Xbox I want to play this game so bad but I don’t have a pc or anything that supports steam. I would seriously love to see this on console. This game is going to definitely be the top backrooms game out there. Can’t wait to see what you add next!
You know, I thought the Animated King boss would put you through an actual academic test. Math, Science, Language, Phys Ed, etc..
Bruh that flying truck spooked me
Why is it called escape the backroom instead of something nostalgic and scary like liminal nightmare?

Can we talk How i wanna donate some 20's to His game every time Please add donation Buttons here are the buttons  20$ Small Donation 35$ Medium Donation 50$ Huge Donation 100$ Mega donation you can either do any of these donations adding in the game one day
I am saying it now best gamedev channel out there.
use this method to make your game endless:  let's imagine you have 5 minecraft chunks of vision in places outside the angle (5 minecraft chunks) everything else disappears and when it comes back (a.k.a:player) when it will be replaced with something different use a randomizer for that that wil look like backrooms more
[FIXED] The game is so cool right now, the first thing i will do os check the update when i can!  A problem though, my brother has a kind of normal pc and his cpu can't play the game after this update so can you add low graphics mode or something for people with bad pc?
the moment the truck fell i jumped randomly

So if you do get caught by one of the entities, do you get jumpscared or do you just die?

The Waffle House Has Found A New Host
Cool game Thank you!
I bought this game when it first came out and you are really putting the work in to just make it even better so thank you for the extra effort you are putting in!
You should do a makeship plush for one of the entities. That is something I would buy. Make a poll and whatever entity gets voted for is picked.
idea for multiplayer . add voice chat and make the game record your voice and the game makes your voice into a tts thing and the robot tts will tell your friend where the monster is so the monster gets you.
please change the name to sommething snazzy btw nice update
Fancy: you can meashure my backrooms level in inches Me: WHAT THE HELL IS AN INCH?!?!

This game ain’t worth 11 dollars 😂 just make it free or nobody will play it within a week
thats why it needed an update
Waffle house had found a new host
When you have a lamp top on your head you will have your sneak level increased by 100?
hey, hear me out, as i can understand you want to add level 9 on your next update, so please, be sure to add: "Neighborhood Watch" entity. Without that, we can't call it level 9!
6:43 me when I have low iron
You should add weapons so we can fight back against the entities or other players Edit: Didn't know there were weapons in the game
Can you try to make this on PS five
You should add level -5 and -250 2 levels with a entitycallee the walking pylon
The animated king is actually just a flash of light. In case you didn't know
Please please pretty please when you make of your backrooms  escape game please just please add in the VR store because I do not know how to use a computer to transfer a VR game into my computer so please pretty please just please don’t be like all those other backrooms games where you gotta use a goddamn monitor to literally get a new VR game, so whatever you do, please please I am your biggest fan. Please do not bend me over please it would be my dream pet.

Is this going to be a free game?
I’ve been trying to find someone to play this on I just bought it
Hey man I love your game and the update made it amazing! Its challenging, terrifying, and very satisfying. I got to level 94 and it’s a challenge but love it. I hope to see more levels in the future.

Fancy: "So I made a LiDAR scanner" Me: "wait no, it's radar" Fancy: _shows the scanner putting dots on the wall_ Me:   :0
Level 3 is world hard level. Scary and puzzles are very hard
Fancy make Real backrooms. Please go on. And add New big and scary levels.
GGs Fancy, i see that your game has extremely good graphics and gameplay just by watching this video, this is proof indie games can surpass triple a games
I just want to say something the males don’t attack you only the females attack
Add to oculus store
Animations actually come in a variety of looks not just wooden puppets there’s also ones made of plastic and clay with the only similarity being there choppy stop motion movement Also should probably give the Animation King a crown overwise he’s just some clown
Can you make this in VR? that would be cooooooooool
Is the game free?
Available on steam only. price is 8.99$
3:32  the flying trucks killed me 😂

I have a banger idea for the models (definitely ain’t stealing Danny’s idea) add cosmetics
Let me question something do you know where you will go after you die? If not let me say you can have a choice to either go to hell or heaven see 2000 years ago there was this man named Jesus who died on the cross for our sins and rose alive 3 days later all because he truly loved us he died for us so I question you now do you truly believe in Jesus or do you live for the world turn to Jesus Christ trust in him Christ has way much more to give than the world he loves us turn to Christ
Pls tell mee
Is it in App store?
I think you should have made the animations have lower animation fps to make them look like stop motion
I don’t think it’s free on vr pls make it free
0.2 also has white walls
e
The game is great, update amazing but in this video i felt honestly really bad for this wretch at 6:43
I like ior videos
can you change the skin from player pls.
You famous Fancy
in the next video you should add that "The Insulation" level from the wikidot (or maybe just some of it's areas because it has a lot of areas)
this video is currently 47 on trending! nice job fancy
0:00 i thought i clicked on the wrong video
Can you add a zooming ability with the vhs filter?
It’s been 1 year now there’s new
Search up entity 33
This is what I’ve been waiting for out of a Backrooms game this is awesome
I know nothing about game development but this just made me wanna learn for myself, this is cool as hell
Unheard and will never be heard suggestion.  You should add backrooms level: you cheated. A maze You have to run through while an entity chases you.  Also, Backrooms level: crimson fields. yah that's about it.
Oop, time to make another video on this game
is there a way to change the level in single player when you host??
Can you make the game on ps4
Cool game really like it, please continue working on it. Can't wait for new levels and enteties.

Your YouTube videos are the best I’d like to wash the back rooms the raccoons one
You’re my favorite YouTuber

Idea: Make it where you are able to place down cameras and using a tablet to look at the cameras.
I love you
before 500k subs club
U need more players this is rly good
Once vr support comes out I'm buying this game 100%
Tbh I would make the animated king like a blue slightly humanoid lump of clay with dents in its head for a mouth and face and a crown and one of those robe cape things
How can you add welvo 5065 and even put your game on android
Level run for your life when
Your game is irrelevant to lore there is no entity`s in level 0 only an object called carpet fluid it's the reason why the carpets are so damp but I understand level 0 got no entity's recently so I don't blame you but it did update like couple months ago but still what ever just update it
as someone trying to be a eu4 dev, i love the amount of effort he puts in to make it feel so real
To mention animations also take the form of clay being that will try to drown you in clay Edit: to mention the animated king is more like a glowing light because he is incomprehensible so he just is a vague shape of a human made of light
Lol imagine if he adds a machine gun that anialates every entity lolllll XD XD XD XD XD.
I was finally able to buy the game
0:07 all of the entities should be scared
cant wait for vr support!
That new item you made for the dark room remindes me a lot about this one Gary’s mod mod don’t remember what it’s called but it has a very similar use
The Waffle House has found its new host.
Wow you uploaded fast again
Finally
Add the Hard to Destroy Reptile/SPC-682 that has a very low chance to spawn. It would be copy rated, but Roblox already milking it millions of time now, but you could just made a different look and change this anomaly into entity. Give a lot of power can detect the player every time.
You forgot about kitty's house didn't you?
The waffle house has found it's new host
For level 6 you should make it so when you enter the level your flashlight breaks when you try to turn it on or the batteries just fall out and liquify
I can’t wait for vr
Hey! Can you add level 100
Level idea : i was thinking yesterday about a cool level I made up…..your in a warehouse,thousands of boxes even millions, out of those million boxes in one box there is a book with one word telling you how to get out,but your not alone,as soon as you find this said book,IT knows your here. You have to find the exit as fast as possible…….
The greatest backrooms game ever
What do you make the games 🤔
Why have to pay for the best maps

This is becoming my dream game, also would it be pcvr support or oculus, because oculus needs a good backrooms game
Can you do it on like in apple Play store the Google Play but the phone can you make it a mobile game to please

3:12 SCP x Backrooms OH my gAwD!!!!111!!1            Just kidding lol
the new update is too difficult and too scawy.. plez add on option or something for easy mode..
I love this guy
You can tame male death moths with almond water if they are a if they are alone
Aight, backrooms expert here, here’s a suggestion: Add the opposites of the entities, most main entities have a opposite counterpart such as skin givers, frowners, partypoopers.. oh wait, not partypoopers. There one of the most well known entities but they are extinct. Anyways, continuing the list is Puppy. Do research by yourself.
You're the best game developer I've ever seen! You are actively doing the game, and you have time to do YouTube competently!
YES LEVEL 94 (which i like to call dreamcore) ITS MY FAV LEVEL YES The SECRETS LEVEL U SAID IN YOUR PAST IDEO WAS ALSO THIS
YES
I suggest you to make level 6.1 which is a bar full of food where you can chill with ur homies or make some funny moments, i also suggest you add level !-! Which is the same as lv ! But 10 times more dangerous
Can you add it to playstation?
Can’t wait to see the vannoss crew play this again.
i love that videos
Man, that flying truck scared me more than any entity. What is wrong with me?
How are I saving storage for this ??
fancy: backrooms game  me: ok but there are already backrooms games on stea-  fancy: vr   me: ILL TAKE YOUR ENTIRE STOCK
3:35 Flying truck jumpscare
you know, I was unsure to buy this, but now I have confidence that the dev is not a furry, dlc planing, untrue announcing, alpha releasing, yandev sucker. I was pretty hyped about atomic heat until they dissolved the studio the third time and now they announce porn characters without any real product to show
Legit got jumpscared by the flying truck
absolute legend, you created a legendary game.
Add level -! It’s basically level ! But the opposite
You should’ve just added Smythers in level 1 because I’m scared of the skin steelers
You should add little cheat codes thing and when someone does it 5 3 4 times they get sent  to level you cheated
I thought the male moths were more harmless than the females
You should lower the frame rate of the animations to give it a more stop motion feel
Can you make it mobile
Male feath moths are not....dangerous  the males can even be tamed with almond water it's only females that are dangerous
it good
Love your videos been waiting for a while now ❤
Dude the other death moths Arnt aggressive
I wached this vid the day it came out
Yay another video
add a furry level for cheaters       and yes i get it, there is a cheaters level, but for this game only
6:32 me in the middle of the night:
the animated king is a big black humanoid figure with a sword and no legs he floats like a smiler
Dani is that you?
you can increase the sprint energy cuz its too low
I think the dolls should be stick figures cause it would be more funny that way
plz can u make a modded backrooms called the nickrooms where all the monsters are happy gamer nicks and his normal live chat gang's profile pics
Can you try to add this game to oculus
You should add building to this backrooms game, aswell as Clan Creation where you can make your own clan and you have a little tag with your groups name on it, i feel like the only place you should be able to build is level 3 as it serves as like a kind of hub in the backrooms lore, and i feel like it would make for a pretty cool feature, like you can display items you find for each level
Such amazing videos every time
I can’t wait for quest support!
Remember when he said that he wasn’t going to add level 6 well here we are. Not complaint though😊
The Waffle House has found it’s new host
Can you make it on ps4 pls this game looks sick
I love this game, but when are you gonna make compatible with consoles.
Be sure to keep in mind your mental state, don't want you stressed out or burnt out.
I’ll be honest I would love for this to come to PlayStation so I could throw money into the money bucket since this is such a unique game
W
is the game on mobile
6:42 Man this part had me dying 🤣
0:03 rats when they see a kfc deep fryer
Fancy I really love your videos and I would love it if you could make the video when you add a VR support cuz I've always wanted to play the game but sadly I do not have a PC but I do have an Oculus aka the VR
can you add shop on lobby game
Wow
When the game eventually gets vr support will it go to oculus quest or just steam vr?
now imagine playing the game in vr using oculus killer headset
Please add a lean brewing station
What is this game called
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSS MORE UPDATES
I have an question can you use VR on this game?
The waffle house has found its new host
You can actually find a layout map of level 6 in the backrooms wiki
Cant wait to play whith THE BOYS
Please make this game even more than it already is. I’d like to see most of the levels. It’s a lot to do but maybe with others help? Anyway love this game!!
Request: level 0.2: fixed backrooms Level 0.2 is like level 0 but better. the carpet doesn’t smell there is a high wifi and devoid of entities. How to find level 0.2 is looking for a door in level 0. A way to see if your getting closer look for paint buckets, ladders, and more. If you go to far In level 0.2 the walls will fall and if a wall falls on you you will die if you follow the walls that are falling you will find the door back to level 0
your story telling using models are so much fun to watch
First video I watched already love this guy
well i bought it so it better not be bad my fellow game dev!!!
YESSS! I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS FOREVER!
Funny parts: Female death moth 1:46 Flying truck (jumpscare warning) 3:31
There should be a demo containing the first 3 levels so i can see if my laptop can run it
I think you need more pipes per level
Bruh I’m wheezing 1:46
The flying truck scared me lmao
The waffle house has found its new host

the problem is that is too good
I think level zero should be redesigned 😐 But the game itself is AMAZING
I'm not sure how he will make level -69 and normal 69 because your forced to be your car.
nice game 👍👍
6:16
suggestion for le game: add player skins pls
you shoulda added 0.*badabababa i'm lovin it* to the backrooms but not make it procedurally generated
Gg!!!
What about the partypoopers
YES FINALLLY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
ill buy when vr support is out
How do you play this game on mobile if you haven't done that then will you because I don't have a computer with a steam account
add pain train from tf2 or a fishing rod to fish a random item from the next level (kinda dangerous but sometime usefull) maybe put a boss fight againt a bone theif in level 121 (the islands) if you add it add uranium, maybe some rocket jumper thing and maxwell the cat
i aint got no money but this shi look mad fun  👍
Do u have a demo
It would be cool if you add xbox
Finally the legend is back🎉
anyone have advice on lv run the only one i was unable to beat
Add the secret level called the hive.
Maybe for the sanity thing you can have a small cutscene in first person where you're just banging your head on the wall until it's game over
Day 1 of asking Fancy to add level you cheated
In the last update you said you would add gamemodes like hide and seek but you didn’t but, thanks for having patience
Kratos in backrooms

You Will add this game in android?

Will the game come to quest?
Can you get it on Oculus quest 2? And if so, do you need a PC?
7:33 Nazi Zombies? hahaha
Hey can you add a gamemode into the game that allows the host in a multiplayer game, to basically have god abilities? I want this to be there so that I can troll the crap out of my friends who have no idea what this game is.
Listen there is more then 1000 levels in the back rooms so you should have lots of updates
BRO IM SCARED HOW DO YOU GONNA MAKE THAT OMG  I WILL GONNA KILL MY SELF BEFORE YOU END THAT LEVELS IM SO EXIDED TO SEE THAT HOW YOU MAKE THAT LEVELS OMG IM SO EXIDED 🫠🫠🫠
You should make it so that players can be in different levels at the same time so they can explore while others can build a base explore or get resources while fighting entities when infinite levels are added.
im not cursed
very epic game
Get this on playstaion
Still can't beat the libary its to hard 🥲
The only reason why im subscribed to this channel is because im scared of noclipping in the backrooms
Lvl 5: roblox Doors

im getting that vr version man
You got my attention woensdag you said "vr support" buying it right aftershave i get home tomorrow haha
Can you make this for console? Cuz for sure I’ll play and also great and good job you made the best backrooms game
Since you redesign the entities why not add better jumpscares
08:48 Largef0rest85 is a complete idiot.
<SUGGESTION> I want you to add achievements in the game because it would make people wanna 100% your game  HERE ARE SOME ACHIEVEMENTS YOU CAN DO. 1. You are an idiot. This achievement is where in level 4 its a 1/50 chance of 1 of the computers having the you are an idiot virus on it  2. Mentle breakdown. Have your sanity be all the way down to 0 to get this achievement  3. Level survivalist.  For this achievement you need to unlock every level in the game.
Hi cool you
If you're adding VR PLEASE add an armswinger option for movement. It SEVERELY reduces motion sickness. Check out Hot Dogs Horseshoes and Handgrenades for a reference!
how about during multiplayer when one of the sanity gets too low they will start attacking other players and will need to be tranquilized with some sort of item. Love your videos.
Ok, i know its hard, BUT will you make this playstation compatable? If yes then in how many years?
Take your time with generated levels, once You get it, its gonna be awesome
Fancy, do a Q and A 😁
You should make a video about what you're planning for the next update.
Wait. It actually feels like he listened to what i commented about on the last video. I literally said that this game won't be good, because it doesn't have any procedural generation, because the backrooms are supposed to be infinite, and then he says this as if exactly with my words. But then, the type of procedural generation he showed in this video, looks like something really ugly. I'd imagine there would be fixed room layouts, that can randomly connect to each other.
Does the flashlight have battery or can you just use it for ever?
Bro finally posted another video
1 day ago
this is so cool man, congrats.
Can you make negative levels?
I'm new
Update: last video I thought he got him self glitch into the backrooms  Update: he’s alright he’s not in the backrooms Update: he got him self stuck inside the backrooms again well here we go again
He makes videos of him making a level and updating the game in an entertaining way
Ur games awesome 🎉
LESSS GO NEW VID
These videos are Interesting and epic. Thanks for the epic content would marry 10/10
I love how he animated kratos falling and noclipping 😂😂
I love the update dude keep it up ima play it later 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉❤❤
I'm kind of sad how I can't play this game since it cost 8 dollars(usd). this game looked really cool and I wanted to play it but it cost 8 dollars.
Add level 69? Aka The road-trip of Affliction No it’s not a joke
i miss when the backrooms were made creepy by the eerie emptiness
this game is getting better and better  GOOD
y do I like watching people making games
lidar scanner was such a good idea
such a good update played for 6n hours straight but somethings need more explanation
obamna....................   SODAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!!!
Ima be real with you chief by subtract less chest and add some legs
is anyone having voice chat problems when playign with friends  like the voice chat stops working when you load into a new part of the map like go on to the next level
Your game is soo good
Can you put the game in mobile pls pls
Moths :)
It would be cool to see if on the lidar scanner the dots only appeared on some sort of other screen or something and not on the characters vision, since lidar is pretty much how some computers and robots see. Or if instead it is some kind of sonar type pulse.
I'm gonna try to get the game soon I can already tell its gonna be fun
I did find some bugs tho
already did the entire game easy lol
I dont have the money to buy that game😔
I have a Oculus and I am sure as heck I'm not playing, I am going to strait shit my pants.
Need the option for the infamous vhs effect.
Perfecto
Hello fancy your a funny youtuber and I enjoy your videos. Also I have some ideas for entities Clumps they can be found in level 2 or you can add them in to another level if you want, Wall Worms, Toxin Spitters, The Howler they can be found in level 1,  Searchers. Searchers are giant, 60-foot-tall humanoid figures that wander across Level 311 you can read the rest in the wiki if you want. I also got some level ideas level 311, The Cabins of Time, The Deep End, Level ?. Those are all my ideas you can find the entities that go in the level ideas I put here. That's all thank you for being a good youtuber and making my day more better. Hope you like and use some of my ideas. :D bye
You should add a team fortress two reference, where if you use the spray can,a 1 in 1000 chance will happen where a picture of Heavy appears  Just sayin 🤠🤠🤠
So I’m the first level after getting the key I always fall after passing through the door, but then when I get to the stairs and go up them the game crashes
MORE BACKROOMS BOI
Cn u ad pinaple
Can't wait to my cousin thr good news
Give me vr support
I almost forgot about this game lol
The legend came back for another great video
3:34 got laughing lol
His game is already good how many more levels is it gonna add
this is just noclip vr in another way but way better way way better
I only see two patch notes on steam. Are all these updates out or going to come out in one huge cluster?
Cool🎉
hi can you respond to my post
You should have the game on lover quality and put it on mobile
Fancy is the only person who can find his dad in 8:12
i am not playing your game because when i saw the animated big mac i hated you!1
Finally more updates
When is the game coming out?
I have an interesting idea I know sometimes when a traveler goes insane, they turn into a rat, so if you’re playing multiplayer and you go insane after a few minutes, the body will turn into a wretch
You can tame death moth mail deny hostile at all I watch your YouTube channel about the backrooms isnae brutally the death moth males doesn't attack you you should change that to your next video
Would there be any way of making animations look like stop motion animation? Maybe make there movements snap to "frames" 8 times per second.
Wretches are crippled prunes
Vr coming soon???
the first part got me😆
Thanks for the bug warning, I have a phobia of bugs.
How much is your game? 8:48
Guns

When for the phones dude?

I love your game but can you add a peaceful leval
OOooooo lala
Awesome, bigger is great

In the next one can you add level 9 please
Bro I love level 18376172637
its cost money, sadly.
only real complaint i have is the change from the robots to the monsters on level fun. There was just something about the robots and the music that fit perfectly and scary together.
Btw. It's been 2023 and you made this awesome video. Your the best :D
I COPIED THE GAME IN MINCRAFT IS GOD THE GAME
Great start
Dude I'm so stoked to see the direction this game is going. I'm so glad you blew up! Excited to see more :)
Pay no attention to the man in the corner, he's just watching
This boi said he bad at modeling… bruh the hotel my man
Can’t believe I’ve been subscribed since 20k
LOL to the video
0.1 scary but funny in the video💀
I actually somehow saw your game on steam before I saw this video, goofy ahh coincidences
I like it when he makes it funny in the videos but in game it's teriffing☠️💀☠️😳
This is a huge scale game
yo once you do add vr support could you make it quest support?
I can't wait to play with the new update,but one tiny detail you missed is that the male deathmoths are more calmer and only attacking when disturbed,the female deathmoth on the other hand will attack the person no matter what.
I like this game I didn't know you would be back about this😁
Boiler room 😂😂😂😂 who knows hazbin be like nice
Hello Fancy You Are The Creator Of Escape The Backrooms??? Well, if so, then, can you make a MOBILE PORT???
Level 94 is just Ohio
The fact that someone unsubscribed just because their game crashed…
Me doesn’t subscribe: “AAH HELP IM IN YHE BACKROOMS”
Is this game going to be avaiable in PS store?
1:44 BRO RUGHT WHEN HE SQAUSHED THE BUG I GOT COC AD
Will you add the lite version  Lite version : no multi-player and good graphics
nice
Can't wait to see Smity play this again
Just played the new update with my buddy, electrical station is fucking horrifying. Can't wait to play with more of my buddies. Keep updating the game man, there's so much potential with your developing skill. ♥
Is this the same game where the Vanoss crew got stuck for almost an half hour in the Baloon birthday party section?
Is it free?
YESSSSSS!
FINALLY A NEW UPDATE
I want more videos
I love his vids and it takes so long but it’s worth it to wait

There is a a top down view of the pitch black level.

Please make it to the meta or Oculus quest 2
If you add to Xbox and it's good I'll buy it
Let’s go new video
Add-guns or I won’t subscribe
You also forgot the beast of level 5
Deer fancy I think some guy took your game and made it in VR but a lot worse its called no clip VR on the Quest 2 the models are bad the skin stealer is really really bad it just looks like vecna       Ps love your vids bro
that one comment wow is said: i downloaded ur game and i ceashed FIX UR FRICKING GAME! i all ready un sub because of this wow
Yey!! a new video!!!!
6:19 lmao straight from the game lidar really intresting idea
This looks awesome.
0:10 The skin stealer literally A posed on the left 💀(when it is almost off the screen)
I play escape the backrooms srived until I reached LVL ! amazing job on your work but on question can you add a stamina bar because I don't know when I will get tied or running
Can you add hats and in game coins?
still waiting for promisedland 0_0
That truck made me shit my pants
When it comes out in VR please let me know😂
Wretches are cool but maybe move it too another level because the entire point of level six is it's so dangerous even entities can live their
I just got your game it’s so good, EXCEPT I CANT BEAT LEVEL 1. Beside from that your game is literally a🔥✨M A S T E R P I E C E✨🔥 You making a actual “great” Backrooms game is so cool. You are a cool guy bro.❤
What if someone made a version of the backrooms but more like a Minecraft style game like surrvival game and the end you try to escape
What if someone made a version of the backrooms but more like a Minecraft style game like surrvival game and the end you try to escape
can you add this game for MACos PLZZZZZZ =]!!!!
Flying truck is the scariest jumpscare
VR now!
Ĕ
Oh Fancy do you know that backrooms has negative levels too.  For EX: ● -1 gliched halls ● -2 overflow
bro the second the dude smashed the bug. an add played about guacamole.
Hey, so you probably heard about how to get in the backrooms .Like glitching trought the flor. Could you introduce a chance to glitch back out of the backrooms? A very small chance such as 0.00000000001%. And if it should happen then at some point random in the middle of the game. I think this would be realistic becasuse the only way getting out of the backrooms is glitching back in the "Overworld/Normal World"
Yay new video
1:35 ngl kinda cute
real
If that game goes on Meta Quest I will give it a smash
Add level 7 pls
the thing that would be really cool is if like everyone is playing on the same map and as you are wondering around you could find other people and talk to them but may be very rare
yay
I love our content and stuff, but what the fuck is Beverly room
WOOWOWOWWOOWWOOWOWWOOWOWO
Song on start plz
add mic usage for the game to use in multiplayer to record you and your friends and lure you to other entities
you could add an event or boss when you meet The 'Gentleman' from level 5.
He used the scp shy guy sound
Bro the new level is level 11
Is there a level 69
ngl the part where the guy was saying that he was playing on phone and game crashed just shows that you only need to tell them its on STEAM not on Appstore or any mobile shit, you can keep the other name but remind the bathroom gamers that its on steam and no problem, if they dont have a pc then they have to get real
search up animated king backrooms and its TERRIFYING
Fortnite
Lets go look vr
This probably won't happen but I have an idea for a sort of multi-player side mode. Essentially, one player is randomly selected to be an entity of choice. These entities will all have their own special abilities, like the bacteria monster can make a sort of hive that will generate an ai bacteria that will aid you for about a minute. While the other players must find clues to some sort of  puzzle before they can escape
Finally you added update
Fun Fact: Male Deathmoths are tameable, to tame one, go near a male deathmoth with some almond water on hand.
can you give smilers a physical body pls? also the sanity meter thing just kinda makes the game worse for me
Bro I've been waiting for a new video
How do you play this
Ty to listen me!
Dude this game is going to be insane, i don't know how far you plan on going with this as there is a endless amount of content you could add but this is already so amazing to me, keep up the good work man, you seem extremely skilled. Also don't forget to sleep.
Woooh I am excited! Last time I've played, I got stuck in Level 3 ... too hard 😄
We have been blessed with another fancy upload.. brace yourselfs we won’t get another one for a few months
why you bully me the prices bigger then donald trumps fat but
Can you possibly add more player slots in multiplayer?
show us a vid of how much money you made being a youtuber game developer pleaasee
What about those game modes you talk about in one video
aren't female death moths tameable?  edit: male*
return
i like how your using not just one source for the info of the backrooms
One question can you download it on MOBILE,because if not then do that.
Can you please make it so you can change your keybinds for walking? AZERTY keyboard here and it's very annoying
LESSS GOOO ANOTHER VIDEO!
Heyya Fancy, I know that you put alot of effort into it...but it just became Unplayable for me and my friend...Everything looks great, but alot of the levels immediatly took down our Sanity (Literally) and it just really got extremly frustrating. Still you made a good game, just please try and make it at least a little bit easier, especially the boiler room, K Thanks. BUHHBYYYYYEEEE
I have idea   You should add a couple cheats or shortcuts in your game so player can cheat in the backrooms(you can see where this is going). Later if they finish the game by using cheats only, you can trick them by sending them to that one empty small room with one door that is wide open, but can't see anything out there, with a text saying:  You cheated. Someone coming.  And a jumpscare by something, I guess.
pls add the slides and the train to nowhere it would be so cool if u added those or just the tiny things in the poolrooms as like an tiny waterpark with the slides and stuff
Hey, will the game be availible on the Oculus store once it gets VR support?
Dis looks like your time for building Dis game like 9000000 hrs
Finnaly
Please add toggle crouch please my fingers hurt
LES GO UPDATE WOOOOO!
Another suffer another video When i suffer while you making the video I suffer from exams and test waiting for you to update and I watch every single video
Male is nice and non hostile
How to get it on mobile
You should add voice acting to the character you play when play signal player
will it have quest support?
Will VR support, if added, be standalone or tethered?
i love how this developer is loyal to his game like even months can pass but some developer in that matter of time can just abandon their game but fancy he always listens to the fanbase and thats a great thing good developers do. Great job Fancy :)
Can you make that game in samsung tabled?
Keep up the amazing work! You're awesome!
Will it be on pcvr or quest 2 vr
POGCHAMP
YES FINALLY
My respect for u sir! The game looks awesome!
if you actually add vr support, i will die via cardiac arrest for scaring my fucking ass so much by deathmoths
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Can't wait
Put PlayStation in the game I put PlayStation your game
Somewhere down the line can you add console support?
Will you add Melee Weapon's like Machete Knifes or Dagger's so you can Defend yourself from Enteties  But to be balanced make melee weapons rare
ima play this on vr when it comes out
You should add survivor bases
Please add jump scares that would be much more terrifying and would help get a more backroom-like experience, cause then you really don't want to get cached
The truck scared the heck out of me and my soul😂
Can't wait to see sublevel McDonalds!
FINALLY AN UPDAT
i alr thinking that you would add this level
Just have an idea some of the negative levels are like an acid trip so maybe add som?
You should add a entity I forgor the number but its a cat that you should not scare and I mean it.
Love that somebody is actually making a lidar game
Is this game on vr
Did NoClip VR take your player model?
Make level 7 with tiny and 9 pls!
Hi could you add the temperature in celsius so us eauropean guys could survive?
Why you weren't given oscar?
I hate how the backrooms are just a watered down scp now
Interesting
Add vergil
its too short
yo this update is incredible, it feels like you redid like the whole game :O
You should remake lvl fun for inspiration look at Chanel called lost in the hyperverse
Imagine how it will feel playing in VR
if you put it on oculus or xbox I will definitely get this!!!!!!!! this looks amazing :D
Can you make you own level like maybe a fancy restaurant and a mutatied chef  and bonetakers
Hello I wanna ask. Please can you just give us option to remove chromatic effect. it is annoying and you never had a real experience enjoying textures and high end art of the game. Thank you.
I wish we had a reales date for VR support
This is nice
How do yo get to the hub?
THE UPDATE RUINED THE GAME! I CAN PICK EITHER STATION OR LEVEL FUN, BUT IF I GO TOWARDS LEVEL FUN, THE MONSTER IS LITERALLY ALREADY SPAWNED BEFORE THE SHORT DARKNESS. THE STATION IS LITERALLY THE HARDEST LEVEL IN THIS GAME TO DATE, BECAUSE THERES TONS OF THOSE FUCKING DOGS THAT ARE STRONGER THAN SENATOR FUCKING ARMSTRONG AND WILL ONLY BE STUNNED FOR 0.5 SECONDS, WHILE ALSO YOU HAVING TO NO HIT ALL 3 OF THOSE MOTHERFUCKING LEVERS AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
this man solos the isles dev team
Please add pissing for when you drink too much almond water
I CANT BEAT ELECTRIC STATION
2:24 level 94 aka peppa pig land
he's so fancy he makes me think horror games are chill and funny
Fun fact: you can tame male death moths
1 vid per year but still worth it
1:36 male death moths are actually really chill and even tamable
add vr to this game
Male deathmoths are actually good
bro this game is so cool, kinda sad u didnt add the main attraction of level 5, the beast of level 5
I recommend you to only put things from the wikidot
Honestly I love how hard working Fancy is (and no this isn't a bot commenting this)
The king returned
He should add level you cheated
a cool multiplayer feature could be if your friend  loses his sanity on level 6 a wretch would spawn in
The radar idea just reminded me of that one cool gamemode on Garry's Mod called "Lidar" who is based in other cool game
Kratos fell in the backrooms.
The scanner reminds me of another game, i don't remember what's called but i think that it was scanner sombre or something like that
The entire game reminds me of chips challenge
Finally!
I feel like playing this
And please add it on mobile and tablet we are hell over here with iPads and phones it’s stressing me out
LESOGOGOGOOGOGG./LK?????????????????????????
the bit at the start with kratos is amazing and i have been following your channel for a while i plan on getting the game when i get a somewhat decent pc to download it
Please gun
Is there going to be vr support anytime?
Can you do a bone theif a entity that steals your bones it’s in level zero has eyes in its mouth it’s yellow and blue at the top
I waited 2 fucking months for this masterpiece
YEEEEES
bro the lidar scanner is a very nice idea good job
the male death moths are friendly and they can help you.
So glad I bought the game half a year ago, excited to see how it's expending
You could make that when the character dies, his camera falls. And as soon as it hits the ground, this is the game over
Add some guns, doesn’t matter if they do damage or not. Just holding one will make me feel a lot safer
I have got an idea!Can you add the entity 110 it would be a good entity for a trap.
YESSSSSSS SOMEONE FINALLY GOES OFF THE WIKIDOT VERSION IVE LOOKED FOR SO LONG
i feel like with sanity you should make fake entities appear, so if you sanity is low you see a entity and run away but to your friends they just see you run away from nothing
Bro next video please add vr support
The vr support announcement was it for me!  I am very hyped.
I love how he trusts his little friend guy in the very beginning of the video when he was just a skin stealer
say uncensored bad words now
you should make thegame free and add cosmetics it would make you famous  IM POOR
Make a ending pls
I don’t really like the idea of a Mc Donald’s in the game, but everything else is so cool
Pls backrooms objective
help
Heh... VR support..... I heard a new VR headset came out... like the one that will kill you if you die so basically the backrooms irl... FUN!
He already added this to the game right?
Epik E
I mean I already go to level end but not in this update so I decide to update my game and then when it was finished I got on the game and I couldn't get on my other levels that I got on
Will you ever release a PS or Meta Quest one for this because I really love this type of content but don’t have a PC to play it on
3:05 this be the “oh no he don’t bite” type of thing-
this guy has went above and beyond with his games.
You need to quest port this…
I love seeing the updates of this game, I really want to play it, but I’m a Mac user, so I can’t. will Mac support ever be added
Your videos are so good
Do you need some eclusive backroom level?
Quality video, quaity game. Plus, big ups to you for keeping to backroom canon rather than just copying kane pixel!
bro the LIDAR looks so cool
cool
He he how many people here download the wrong game here me:no
This is just my opinion but, level 5 according to canon lore has no entities whatsoever. Level 5 also lowers your sanity constantly which is mostly the main threat. When you get to level 5 you’re actually always going to be alone. The only entity in the level is a guy in a painting. I suggest you look up the entity cause I think it’s a little confusing to explain here.
Shit... He added ohio
Make it vr
I HAVE BOUGHT the game it very pro
PLS do LEVEL FUN :) next
That game is really good keep it up man
How many levels did you add to this game??? will you be adding all the backrooms levels????
Sadly I can’t play it because my pc broke😢
I love this
finally fancy upload the video ❤️
keep on keepin on hope ur doin well!!!
can you make a consel version
Ⲃⲁcⲕⲅⲑoⲙz
Add vr
skin wlkera
nice
Will these be added on the vr version?
Look it would be nice to add consol support don't need to
For the lean mechanic, when you lean fully left or right, I wonder if you could make it so the lean animation stops gradually, instead of it being abrupt? I’d also like to be able to lean over items as well, and hiding under objects.  Alongside this, could it be made so that, if you’re using a controller, when you hold the lean button and use the joystick for the camera, I’d like it so however much you move the joystick, that’s how much your character leans.  Similar to the lean/hiding mechanisms in Alien: Isolation.  Also, level ! please.
This is insane! I love how passionate you are about this project, and I hope this project can outlast the Backrooms trend itself. AMAZING JOB DUDE! ❤❤❤
I wonder what will happen?
make it a little bit longer  by the procedural thing is a good idea
Yo could you attempt condole compatability
Suggestion: What if you make the clown look more like a puppet and make the puppets animations more stiff and unsettling? Keep up the good work.
ngl, its almost 3am and I dont want to get sucked into the backrooms so im literally subscribing because you threatened me, other time like, any other time it wouldn't work LOL
When you add VR will it be on oculus or will it still just be on steam?
The way the female deathmoth grabs him after he stomped on the male deathmoth made him regret real quick
This game star like a joke and now is a master piece
Regular games: just put patch notes and couple of characters  Fancy: makes videos about it
10/10
Is it freee?
I thought he died. And can you please make the cave level?
YES
yay
#Fancy Suggestion: Add the woodrooms level 27 they are like level 0 but with wood walls. But it's class 5 and there doors with entities behind. And you can get there if you break the floor in level 0.
nothing stops me grom cracking it
Hehhehehe wH@[ sANitY? I tHinK ¦ hAVe ¶RoblEM aBOuT |T
Idea: add a way to trade with players online at the hub level.
Will it be n quest
Fancy this game on Android
You're like dani creating best game by your own . good times i missed you and dani
Make Br free cos people wast £299+ on them
Zenith?
The equipment is a sign that the wretch is smart the dumpber the wretch the more it ignores you and the less equipment
The floating castle on level 94 is actually on a hill thats invisible
Everyone should subscribe this man is the goat best backrooms game I ever played
Idea: Add Ammo but no guns so people who dont watch your videos think there is
The cartoon music stops at night in level 94
You can tame male death moths
I will correct ur mistakes,i know alot about the backrooms.espacially entities
When he said vr support I was like YES LETS GOOOOOOOOOO
can you pls add a neco ark entity and a flamethrower to kill em? btw its an actuall entity basically neco arc but its evil and lowers your sanity.
I really want to play this on ps4😢
i thought u gave up on this but keep it up!!
I love the amount of work you put into this man, KEEP IT UP!!! ❤
This is great and funny, I hope your exited about vannossgaming playing this :D
Love your work
dude, you make the funniest videos ive ever seen.
I like the flying trucks
Quisiera ser una mosca para pararme en tu piel
It’s a ball room
Suggestion about the animation king: I think what you should do instead of the king attack in he uses your worst fears and when I mean worst fears I mean he puts you in this map where you have to survive a set amount of time but will that Is happening you have to survive from the entity's that the player had died to the most bur this ides requires some hard to counter entity's for this work but  if this does not WORK then here is the backup plan:the king will send you in a selection of 3 maps that are completely different let me give you a example for example the king has the selection of 3 maps he can choose from from those 3 there are 2 I will name for those example i)there is a room full of almond water ii) there is a room full of entity's do basically he can choose between them both it is a random chance plz read this at least Idc if you implement it or not as long as you see it
NEW ESCAPE THE BACKROOMS VID?!LESSS GOOOO🎉🎉🎉🎉
Who is one key feature to remember about level lights lights out anything doesn't work no technology can be used on level lights out so that flashlight yeah it's going to be off if you had it so it makes no sense that the flashlight will work
New update :)
SO COOL
I love that City level it's so cool it's one of the most interesting levels in the back there's no one in the truck in the day but night you might see a smiler you might just see a smile inside of the truck at night
add Stalin
May you please take it to xbox
I love this guys editing style
Finally you making a video I like your videos find Leah I just sleeping just days 100
1:38 It looks like it has B0oBs... e62I could make a wrongdoing of that creature.
as a vr gamer, i have to mention that anything even remotly scary is 100x more terrifying in VR, you will shit your pants if you play this in VR
in my opinion, when you said "also avoiding flying trucks as a result of my terrible coding skills." then BAM! that hazmat guy just got GUT PUNCH by a fricking FLYING CAR was hilarious. By the way, you are way better at coding then I'll ever be really, I mean like, your making a game about the backrooms.
Dude the lidar scanner is the best thing you could add man thats so cool
PLS MAKE THIS GAME FREE SO I CAN PLAY IT
BRO
Bro I was eating dinner with the family and you posted new backrooms update while I was eating dinner. Good one LOL.
This is AMAZING! Idc how long it takes for u to add it to VR, I will wait because it’s just gotten better!
3:31 no jumpscare warning wtf?
Love the edition of the video
6:21 there is cool game around that topic and it's called scanner sombre
3:34 i want to die right now
hey you are back!!!!
entity 33
How do you escape level 1
you could add level !- which is a level theres docters not hostile and theres rooms entites are skin stealers-hoglers-smilers-hostile docter and if you drink lquid pain from docter you will lose 50% health and theres something called lights out and after lights out the normal unharming docters are hostile and hoglers and skin stealers and smilers has a higher chance spawning so the level !- is just like level ! but the lights are blue and the level is longer so the lights out come after 2 mintues and you can explore the rooms but the main goal is to reach the end before lights out or even in lights out
I feel like procedural generation is a really bad idea
Wow it's been a year since I last seen
I can’t wait for vr support
the game look so fun  if i was alble to buy it tho
Fun fact the male death moths are able to be tamed
Hi
VR SUPPPOOOOOORT.  THE VR SUPPORT IS REAAAAAAAL!
idk if thats added but if you start a game you drive a car and you fall thru the road noclip and goes to backrooms
Ya know, all this Backrooms stuff is AMAZING, and it really tickles my *fancy*
I'm just gonna give you straight my man, if you ever fix the body animation when looking 90 degrees up I'm getting a refund. Jokes aside now though me and the bois are loving this game, we played yesterday when you released the new content and gotta say, I'm personally amazed that this game is even better than before. Not that before was "meh" or anything, it was fun, but too short. I'm looking foward to playing this more!!
The truck scared me
this game is so gooododoodod
Mac support?
The animation of the game the graphics the game itself and the YouTube channel all amazing, keep it up! 😊
Thank you Fancy!
3:33 flying truck jumpscare
Does the game support controller or is it keyboard and mouse only?
Should add a kicking option for vrplayers that allows them to kick entities but also make it so that if they kick to early they lose their balance and get insta killed by the entity they tried to kick
finally
Make the level with megalaphobia
Use assassin creed leap of faith in next video start
I don't mean to be annoying but male deathmoths aren't that dangerous
Let's goooooooooooo NEW UPDATE
Bro is in the same spot in the thumbnail
what happened to the hide and seek game mode he said was being added in this update?
Hey, there is a mobile game similar to yours, it's called NoClip, did you create it?
Cant wait to see vanoss play this game again
i have an idea... maybe add candles as an alternative light, like it has a certain time use,
if u sub u don’t get noclip
Haha I don’t have friends so skin stealers won’t bait me unless….. YOU ADD NPC:s
level 69
Wanna see this in vr gang  👇
gonna buy it when i get paid, looks awesome
I’m not a fan of horror games but this is looking CRAZY GOOD
Bro I wanna get it on my mobile
Why tf was he running like in WaW?
Suggestion : liquid silence ; rare item only obtained by defeating the entity that drops it ( forgot the name ) , it will make it so entitys cannot hear u
i love how every update he did is 10x more than mojang can do to minecraft each update
The games not the best, but it's continuing to become a better game. I love your videos dude
Ive been waiting so long for a video, LETS GOOOO
Can you add level 1.5?
Add ps4/Psvr-ps5/Psvr2 compatibility!!!!!!!!
OMG UPDATE I LIVE YOU
3:31 this part made me jump, I was not expecting that xd <Edit> suggesting the crimson forest with a fast spider creature.
Add guns and you can add simple attachments like a flashlight or a suppressor
When a random guy in youtube creates a better game than most games created by triple A companies.
man this game is amazing please make it free sometime!
Vr support
1669th lol
e
this fixes everything i didnt like with the game
I will be looking to fry my pc
Instead of the bossfight you made for animated king what if it was a phase level with hard challenges based around the most common fears
It's pretty cool what you are doing with game; it's evolving far from the simple streamer game it started as. Making bigger procedurally-generated levels is really cool, though at the same time it's a shame I won't be able to experience the original levels when I eventually get to play this (don't exactly have a PC set-up at the moment). Maybe the older version could be intact somehow as a seperate mode or at least to download?   As for feedback for this video, the only criticism I have is that the boiler room in Level 5 looks nothing like the image of it and looks more like a variant of Level 2. Maybe it could use some visual adjustments?  Also if I could make any suggestions for the game, I think it'd pretty cool as a rare occurrence if one of the rooms that can generate on Level 0 is the original one from the Backrooms photo that started it all.
Every Level you make look official and your modeling has greatly improved
i have the game its good and the graphics are the best i love the multiplayer mode that u can communicate best game ever
Nice new video!!!!!!!
Alfa oxtrot is gunna cooom at this game
Can  you play this game on mac
HES BACK
female death moths are the dangerous ones male death moths can be tamed
Finally an update, I've been waiting
dang i remember when bro was  at like 5k subs (or 14k idk)
I’d recommend you to not be based on the wiki of the backrooms, it does not follow any lore in specific, i’d recomend you check out Kane Pixels, he’s got one of the most unique and interesting lore. Just a recommendation!  Something else, the backrooms do not have an exit other than death.. in the level death! If you die there in a “pacific” way rather than from an entity you’ll go to the real world, but, there’s a lot more chance you’re insane and in horrible conditions. There’s also the way to get out fron the level next from “the end” I don’t quite remember how it’s called but it might be possible to jump out of the stairs in a correct way, if you do this it’ll no clip you to the “death” level
the backrooms starting to look like minecraft ngl
Been waiting for this update since 1885 bro
Can you make lvl 0 easy
Will there be pizza in the backrooms
i love level 5 backrooms thank you so much for making it
#bring back Kracc bacc
Great job
HOW DOS HE MAKE SO GOOD VEDOES!!!!!
Yay new upload
You should add cheats to maybe make it so you could disable insanity
The best moment about procedual generation of Backroom levels is that even if it get weird or empty at one point it'll only be great for the entire liminal thing
When you're done with the main game you should try to make a toggleable feature which will modify the game so it will look like backrooms from wikidot Like, in level 0 you can't meet other people (unless you are in manilla room) and no monsters in level 0. The game is still gonna be good without that option though, as a dev myself I can agree that making games is exhausting.
You should be able to find dead body’s scattered around levels that have supply’s sometimes, it would make the world seem more real. I feel like the random dead body’s you find should not have the yellow suits on.
Add some camera lens dirt and lens flare effect
Yes!!! So happy to see another video from you =)
Suggestion: I hope you see this comment you gotta add mouths to the partygoers hands because the Backrooms Wiki says that partygoers have mouths as hands, also the teeth on the mouths are like sharp so yeah.
I thought lights out was squid games
when it that getting vr support???😬😬😬😳😬😳😬😬😵‍💫💀
Finally
When you add VR support, will you release it on Oculus?
Lol new meme
Yey
YYYOOOOOOOOLLLLOOOOOOO
I have Been watching you since 7k subs
There is a youtuber called swiftbit who makes videos of the backrooms in minecraft. Maybe you can take a look at his channel for more information.
I wish he made the vr back rooms he would ad updates every day
So my idea is I don’t got a laptop but can you make it iPad/mobile controls and downloadable on iPads / iOS / mobile it would be amazing
the nighttime of the house level was funny
How does this man have time to make an insane game and edit the more incredible videos ever???
3:33 that scared me more then the  entire game 💀
this is so cool bro
Me : wow 453K subs. OH I gotta go! Whatever hours later. Huh 461K SUBS
Make this game available on mobile pls
What if you add it on mobile it will probably be the best on on mobile
Let me allow to tame male death moth Since females are more aggressive  And bigger But aes are just chill unless aggravated  But give them almond water to tame them
So you said in a video that youre not going to add level 6 Jokes on you you littel mother fu-

Will this game come out on console?
OMG FINNALY MORE NEWS!!!
Someone Tell vanoss there a New update to play
My dream is u make mobile support
Bet
You should add guns, BUT its more like resident evil where they stun the monsters instead of killing them.  Edit: oop forgot to mention this, even if my suggestion is trash i had the exact same idea as you. (But liminal spaces instead of backrooms.) So I hope it goes well it looks sick.
Tbh from all the games that milk the backrooms ideas this is definitly the best one you can feel the passion behind it and not just "let's make a crappy backrooms game for the attention,views and money"
There's no possible way to this man knowing my pure ahh worst nightmares  Him: clowns  Bro I fuc- I mean I am sh%-/£ng Hella framing of clowns 💀
the king of backrooms game is back                                                                                                                               hi
Finally a new video Im happy:)
There is no "final backrooms level", you just have to traverse levels infinitely until you find the one with the exit to "frontrooms" (reality)
partypooper:am i a joke to you? legends say that their still alive living in the promise land
This Game looks Sick  A Can’t Wait for it to be out Note: I was Dumb And Saw it on SteamAnd Immediately Bought it

Bruh, First of all, your Devlogs are insane! Second, please Tell me If you found a way to add procedural Generator Nav mesh, because so far, the only workarond i found, was to have an already added big Nav Mesh Box and generated the random Levels in it. So please let me know <3

Hate to tell you but.... Male Deathmoths are mostly harmless only the female ones are dangerous Source: my ass... the backrooms wikidot
YOOOOOO THAT'S SO EPIC
BRUH BEFORE I PRESSED THIS VID I WAS HUMMING THE SONG AT THE START LOL
Add Redbull to your Game (By drinking it you can fly/float)
Holy shit level 3 is just straight up impossible, it requires so much luck with the AI and theres is just too much redoing the same shit over and over again
Where can i donate. Like seriously where can i give money to this guy
yo adding apple support sometime down the line would be pretty cool
Fancy is a beast C:

How this man changed the game from a speedrunning game to a full on survival horror game is AMAZING
I thinking is it playable on mobile?
TYSM I WAITED SOO MANY DAYS
Do the titanic level
fun fact: change the male deathmoths to friendly, cuz in the backrooms the male deathmoths are smaller but are not hostile. you can recrute them with almond water
Hey fancy can u make more videos I sub and like so pls make more of those videos 😂😂
6:18  you were so close to thinking we just needed night vision goggles
Pls mobile support
Hello, i can be you’r French translator if you need it
what is the name of the game'
add level 666 and add a insaney
Fancy is a better game developer than 99.8% of all game developers (Bethesda, Valve, etc.)
you shall not dare to change the player model. it is too iconic.
WOOOOOO
i have proposytion to this game add badges
Male death mouths are harmless
Hey Fancy I have an idea for the animated king you could totally do so it randomly changes between models so for a player it’s a clown for other is a humanoid plane or someone with a gun a guy with a chainsaw or smth like that things that give fear so it’s going to be the worst nightmare off the character
It'd be cool if this was in vr
I LOVE YOU ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Nice Its REALLY NICE
I love this guy's content it's so entertaining
Mcdonaldo in backrooms
yooooo a new video oh damn level 5, aren’t male death moths kinda peaceful?
Gangsta til he adds every level
I love the lidar and the spray paint! They’re such cool items!
I go te now
Keep up the good work
can u add the hazmat guy from 8:34
Maybe you should add batteries for your flashlight so it can run out
What the hell 7:34
Is this in vr?? If not pls add it It’s super cool
Im laughing so hard at the guy who thought he played backroom on mobile
Once the game got working it was rlly fun to play this update is very good and WAY scarier. Fancy, keep up the good work!
Thx 4 update
Man I started using unity now I understand why it takes you so long
I love when you upload the edits are so funny and cool and different to other YouTubers
oh i've been waiting for this XD
Finally another episode I love this series
When will it be released?
Uhhhh... You still need to fix the Partygoers. They're supposed to look like a child drew them, matey. That's kinda the entire point.
Can you add shadow people
Yessit
i used to love the backrooms
The death moth is so cute
Ah yes, the flying pig level. My favourite
Pls level7 backrooms
Ok
8hr earlu
AYOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

You didn’t fix level fun though
dude i absolutely love this shit
When you add vr support will it be on the quest store or side quest or will it be impossible to get it on quest?
Can I play this on xbox one??
Finally ive been waiting for a update
Wait,  is this going to be a (mostly) lore accurate game?  Also Male deathmoths can be tamed, and are pretty docile
Make it on mobile please
Male deathmoths are actually neutral an can be tamed to make an army, while females are the only threat.
I dare you to add mobile and that's a dare
now im sure this wont work on my pc
In the backrooms it's not a glitch ITS A FEATURE
Nice
add to console you get lot of money and a lot of happy people
Well NOT ONNLY THERES DEATH Moth's BUT THERES AN ENTITY THAT LIVE in Level 5, And that is THE Beast of LEVEL 5
Will vr be in quest standalone and steam or just steam
THIS UPDATE IS CRAZY THANKS FOR ADDING LEVEL 7
Eyy the legend is back!!!!
Question : Negative levels, will you be adding them?
intro meme awesome dude 👍
The death moth is disgusting but I like it
finally
Epic
This is why I love you fancy
*bro how the heck was he turned into the spc 096???? 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔
Love your videos man
Please dont change how u look like in game 8:54
YAY A NEW VIDEO!!!
Im sold I'm going to try the game i hope it runs lol
my soul left my body at 3:32-3:34
Wasn't expecting a fancy vid today 💀
Is it available on Android????
This guy works so hard to give us a good game🥺also plz make game available for PS4-5 soon cuz I wanna play this but I no have PC
Even tho I dont have the game I would definitely give it a 9/10 (cant sex monster )
the most easiest way to noclip to the backrooms is to go to ohio
is that an indie game how are you doing this
Hey fancy can add like communities in the backrooms like Meg, or save spots for wanders, or something like that? Please 😊
Keep up with the good work this backroom game has so much potential and best even I is not finished
the flying truck scared the SHIT out of me
1.3k
Dude vr wil be so scary LOL
Hey can you add your game on other game platforms? Like the Google play store and app store? Btw very nice job on the game I haven't played it because I can't make a account on steam so that's why I was asking I am really excited to play it
Male death moths are pretty chill i think
The  death moth looks so cute
Great video:)
pls release update 🥺
Normally wretches are everywhere unless specified so maybe put them in other levels also on whikihow it say there isn't any entity confirmed
I’ve got an idea for your game, you can add a character selection in the menu where you can be a researcher(hazmat) or a wanderer which is like a normal person and maybe if you do add this, you can randomize the wanderer so you can have your own character
3:33 top cinco jumpscares Numbero one
lets go backrooms update
your prob one of the fastest good quality game dev
kratos
Omg Ur still alive!!
tf is the turmomitar displaying im from Europ not America
Hi
You should add lucky o milk as item, crimson forest level, water soaker weapon that can be filled with everything
3:11 bro used 096’s scream for someone dying 😂
Cool,see you next 2-3 month.
Fun fact you could tame male moths in the wiki
Claim your early ticket here btw thank you so much for uploading

Pov when Fancy upload a new vid:🍷🗿
Dude, when I saw the notification for the new vid while at my uni I got so excited. Even if I didn't enjoy your game your videos have so much personality and are entertaining to watch, please never stop with your passion I can see how much you love to create.
Finally yesssss
If you want Fancy to play his game  👇🏻👇🏻
I measure in millimeters
Nice
“Babe, wake up Fancy uploaded a new video.”
Xbox support please you're not only VR players end PC players consoles support please and your games not bad
You should add a switch that can make the thermometer to Celcius
Please add "level all hope is lost".
YES!! more gameplay!!
Can’t believe you uploaded again! Good on you! ❤
VR is gonna me scary as hell. Can’t wait for it! Remember to drink water.
HES BACK
If I sub in my family doesn’t does that mean we’re all gonna no clip into the backrooms?
My worst nightmare are trackors they are terefiing
The animated king looks like a shadowy figure not a clown
NEW VIDEO NOW ALL THATS LEFT ITS TO W A I T   6  M O N T H S
I'm sorry, but the Animated King is supposed to look like... A dark, cursed figure. It makes scary sounds next to you throughout the level. At the same time, in the place where the sound occurred, it either will be, or it will not be. 50/50. If you meet him, he will plunge the level into darkness, in which your death will be hidden in the literal sense. It must be heard with sound. If you survive 30 seconds in this horror, then the darkness will disappear and you will have to hide from the animated king, trying to find a way out. I hope this concept helped you and you change something. Or no:/
Can you please add Xbox support
Can you please change the thermometer to celsius?
male death moths are docile female death moths are hostile the difference is Female death moths are bigger. so he said that the male deathmoths are hostile but its the opposite
Can you add this game (escape the backrooms)  on mobile pls
Epik vids man
YAY ANOTHER BACKROOMS GAME UPDATE
The station level is annoying
my dad got lost in the backrooms
After the updates im getting the game
Idea: You should add dirt and stains on the walls in hotel level
3:33 That was a fricking jumpscare
I can't wait to watch people play this  update and get there ass.s scared
I see why this vid took so long
keep the content up your my best youtuber
Please make your game for apple if possible
The game is way too good for a single developer to make.
I waited for this
Finally another fancy backrooms videooooooo
hey fancy. after you add generation please add scraps(it randomly spawns) that you can trade to wanderers for items like almond water or royal rations
now the only thing left to do… add occasional jump scares when playing in VR
have it load in chunks
can you add an option to change farenheight to Celsius
hes got the Roblox lidar scanner
Thanks for the content frfr
POV Fancy posted a video with the backrooms game: YESSSSSSS
YESSS
FINALLY ANOTHER VIDEO
Dude why you put god of war here Kratos is Sad He Tped out of his world
Backroomsmorelikeaustralia
honestly I think A more faithful adaptation of the backrooms would make it a survival horror game but you do you I guess
Also I thought male death moths aren’t hostile
you should add the survival mode level of the backrooms
I’ve got an idea, an insanity meter, entities that drain sanity or certain events drain sanity, you use almond water to treat insanity right, so when your sanity gets low you could have a higher chance to encounter entities and if your sanity hits zero there are different effects on each level if I’m correct Edit: nvm I made this comment at the very start of the vid
Finally you uploaded i waited for this video for so long
Just seen this video and immediately bought it can't wait to play
Love it!
yay you uploaded after months!
pls add level 9223372036854775808 "the promised land"
Normal people watching: cool  Speedrunners: WAIT DID HE SAY PROCED-
I love how he makes the backrooms in months and I love seeing his updates
I want this game but it’s too expensive man I have 0 money and 0 cents
Nvm
Leave the player models alone 😂 they’re goofy that’s what makes them unique
Your game is fun :)
yay new fancy devlog
YOOO FINALLY
This man is determined
Add in Android and iOS pls
We need to go to the hive of the deathmoths
3:33 truck jumpscare
The recroom version in vr has 11 levels I think
You and Dani should make a project together
Yay
I have an idea to have the animations look like blank human templates that move with choppy stop motion animations like the wiki said so
you good coder and game guy, so good i love game!
It's nice to see  a game  grow  its like watching your child grow up but in most case a puppy
OH MY GOD!
This man gets better an better with his intros
Idea: if your playing multiplayer you should make it that sometimes players will spawn in different areas
I love your videos and your game❤
Bro i swear i crapped my pants when the female moth started flying
did someone say hog rida?
i like this guy he care his game. and his fun
I like the player model
and by the way, who loves which monster from Backrooms? Here I-I-I uh, I love all entities
and by the way, bro, I also wanted to create a game and tot want to create a game about Backrooms, but unfortunately unity doesn't work for me, why does it give an error when I want to log in to it, it only worked for the first time and then everything is an error maybe when I was looking for someone I accidentally deleted unity data? but in short, in the sense of the game, I also make sooooo many plans, I want to do almost all the levels there, well, not that everything is straight, but a lot of mechanics are possible, a lot of monsters are also a lot, I still think there are a lot of modes to do there: history, sandbox (it will be open only when you pass the story), survival (there you just will survive as much as you want), progres (there you need to go through as many levels as possible if you die, then shield that all your progres has dropped) challenges there will be challenges, but they will all be closed to open them, you need to complete the task they will be written on the challenge that you want and there will be a hint how to open this challenge and the challenges there will be the same: record the race (there you are on the level! you need to run as many meters as possible), get (there you will be given a task that you need to get with a completed task, the tasks will be completed, for example, such a task may fall out to get some kind of object that comes out with a boss or a very strong monster) there is also a sense of this challenge killer (there you will have to kill a selected monster) get (there you will have to get to the selected level) and other challenges. In my game there should also be minus levels and secret levels, but by the end of my game there is no and perhaps it does not wake up, but it's not bad to dream, do you think when unity is fixed for me, I will try to create this game ;)
NEW VID LETs GO
Cool cool but can you add that game also on mobile devices like on the Apple store and Play store
I literally watched your vids many times in last couple of days and now there is a new one :o
I have an idea you could do the level you cheated I hate my life 😞
new dani fr
Console support and cross platform??
Fancy what is going to other next update super sad with kangkong i'm going to get a pc super sad to play a game
I am so happy this game is getting bigger! And more lengthy. All I've ever wanted wad a full fledged backroom games!
Out of all the things I could have been scared of, it was the truck flying towards me at max speed
Is it gonna be on quest 2?
BRO I BEAT THE GAME ADD MORE
When you get the game VR compatible will it be compatible with oculus quest 2
I didn't notice how goofy the player mask look like
Bro, you really should hire a 3D modeler and animator for the game.
this is possibly the best backrooms game to come out or be in development lately, at least the best where theres survival mechanics
Love your vids! You have inspired me to start studying computer tech, coding, and game design because of how fun you make it look! Thank you so much!❤
is it me or does the animated king looks like a Macdonalds mascot but in different colors?
Idea:add a cool Easter egg where you can find a tree with leviathan axe in it and you get the: BOI achievement
Can't wait to see your future projects such as Level 7 to 11!
At 0:09 the skin stealer turns into a guy, which is good detail 👍
long time no see backrooms man
Finally!!! YEEEEEEEEES!!!
Sanity meter? Bro I would just simply not go insane 😎
Do level 3999 and the promised land
Please add quest support
weeeeeeeeeeeee
1:48
Im defenitly gonna make some content with this game. maybe scare the shit out of my friends lol
VR SUPPORT!!! I’m hyped!
Wat is the discord
3:34 you scared me
It is always a good day when fancy uploads
AAAAAAAAAAAAAA your  vidddds are sooo goooooood i loive ytoyun 89 djhnb icvgdcxsazder plsn mkskem mjdiokrm wes hmelp; hnjrlll;p; backrooms laguws
Played, Enjoyed, Scared.
Could you also make it for Mac users? If so, thank you!
How much does the game cost
Is it just me or the graphics looks better then any game I’ve seen
You’ve progressed pretty far with this game, can’t wait to see the finished product
Black
THE GOAT IS BACK
Oh that's why my game needed to update
YESSSSSSSSSSSS
Bladder level for drinking too much almond water?🤨
dude i downloaded your game on my nokia 3310 and accidentally nuked venezuela😠😠😠 please fix this
There are no entities in lvl 5 just a strong sense you’re being watched by a cephalopod like creature that shows up in pictures and vases
here before this gets 1M views💀
Is this on quest 2
0:41 Beast of level 5?
This Guy Spent Months To Make a 9 Minute Video So Subscribe To Him
BRO I LOVE YOU
A note about the canon appearance of the Animated King: he looks like your stereotypical cartoon king, but with realistic proportions on everything except the face
Are you ever gonna have a level editor? There is not a good way to make a backrooms level without coding. Pls can you do this. Or make it a DLC I just want a level editor for this game. BTW your game is AWESOME 😎😂😂
Will this be on ps4/5
I like it :)
only 32 seconds in and this is exactly what I want from a backrooms game. I just want to explore, get lost for hours.  Half-suggestion too, but building is what really gets me 100% invested into a game. Making my little space, fleshing it out and decorating it as much as possible, surviving against the strange elements of the backrooms while exploring it. like minecraft, but more dangerous and not a block system
Hey there’s a furry in your discord that keeps harassing me and got me banned by their boyfriend mod.
Me a skeleton💀 then figuring out who posted.  Revived
Add this to applab pls if it comes out on VR
The second I heard him say “VR support” I thought of how many night terrors it would cause.. poor YouTubers lol
YAY! I'M A BIG FAN OF YOU! sadly i can't buy it because my parents and i have a windows 10 that can't even run minecraft good... but i would buy it!
Next up, you should add entity 666 level 4000 and level 3999!
bro can you add level 4000 plz? i want to see u try
YES
Keep up the good work! I could see this becoming one of if not THE best backrooms game!
I joined your discord I did not regret it
Cool video
make the vr support for the quest and the quest store plz
1:47 imagine that IRL
Still confused on why it’s impossible to outrun entities tbh
I think if you are going to make a boss in a horror game with no weapons (Other than bug spray) it should have the player do a task while avoiding the boss entity.
This is truely a backrooms moment
A few suggestions are adding PS5 support and add the game master
Can you make it free
.
My guy just added the LÄMP addict
Lije reach 2k
We will get next vid in 69 years
.
Yo he posted after 69 years
My guy only uploaded 10 videos and has 450k subs
finally a new video
Update blew my expectations out of the almond water!
I can’t wait for the vr update cause then I would be able shit my pants harder than my 5 year old cousin
If it has vr support im 100% buying it
Hey! Fancy, this might be a stupid request but. I was wondering if you could make the game compatible with consoles?
based on how the animated king torment based on "your worst nightmares", at the start of the game you could have the player do a short questionnaire to see what their fears are and code different boss battles depending on what the player chooses at the start  edit: to those of you saying it would not work in multiplayer, there could be a dedicated party leader who takes the survey and everyone else would have to fight in that boss battle
He should still ad some puzzle sections in the game
Will this ever be vr compatable, that would be sick
What’s it on
When you add your next video or something can u pin a comment if it's on steam or not bc I have ocules
When you add your next video or something can u pin a comment if it's on steam or not bc I have ocules
I dare you to put it in VR oculus It'll be so scary for users but I don't know how that's going to work
Hopefully the vr support is on quest
Something i wanna see is the ability to use custom player model mids
Hey I think one of you’re backrooms videos was removed
so happy to say i was here before the back rooms made you famous
I love that wrech part
DREAM ON DREAM ON
i would like to say that for the animated king i would have done a mannequin dressed as a magician
3:33 bro the truck coming at me at me all of sudden jump scared me ☠☠
I suggest vr compatibility
I suggest vr compatibility
Love you're content
Will this game be in ps5 or Xbox?
My save fiel deleted i got to hub }:
How do I play
I love your videos and the game looks super fun! Is there any way in the future this game could be ported to Mac Computers?
👍
YAY ANOTHER ONEEEE
LETS GO!
Thank you fancy! I really love this game, gonna put some suggestions on discord soon.
Add the pink village
Bro this youtuber made the best backrooms game ever. I bet this is gonna dominate minecraft
NO, THIS IS GOD TIER AND YOU KNOW IT
They look cool
Just wanted to know if this was going to be on console. Because this looks so cool!!😊
Yes

Suggestion: add an option to remove blood and only have the body
?
app story
steam
what is your games on
Why did you make the first level so hard😭
Male death moths are technically harmless,  only the female ones are dangerous
When you get vr support could you put the game on app lad or just the main quest store
fancy can you please make a real animated king model really please because that clown is used in a lot of games and you can make a concept of the animated king just use your imagination maybe it sounds like (make the game how i say ) thing but man if you are gonna sell this game this needs to look decent because if not you are just another generic backrooms game
1:48 this almost gave me a heart attack
More videos
big
OH NO! 😅
Btw lol 94 has a neighborhood vintage going into rows that's just a different area
wut happened to adding mr kitty tho
This guy low-key making THE backroom game
Please add it on mac
Nice
Yes a new update on the game❤
Can you please make the game run on Mac please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please
I'm getting Apeirophobia level Lights Out flashbacks
Can you make a mobile version of this game and put it on apple or google store pleaseee😢🙏🙏🙏🥺🥺🥺
I wish I could play this on mobile
What if there was an entity that will copy your voice based off your microphone
Hey does anyone know how to beat level 2
"dude I just downloaded your game on my phone I got go the level where the pig Flys in the air it crashed into me and I crashed fix your freaking game" lol
Finally! A new upload
these videos are so cool
If the player model is gonna get changed, can you keep the old one as legacy so people could still use the funny one
Really neat! I really want the level 10 (Almond fields) which has a group of entities called "The Harvest", which are like scarcrow people. It would be cool if it had a day and night cycle and various farm buildings as well. Excited to see where this project goes in the future!
My friend was changing his audio while we were setting up a game. We started the game while he was still in his settings and he still had it on his screen and he couldn’t take the settings menu off while he was in game. Please fix because we love this game ❤
How the hell do you pick up the parts of the ladder?
Bro i got scared when that truck hit him
you vidioes are the best
Were did the “why is every entity a representation of me?”
You know the dreamcore eyes you should add that to the level with all houses or thiren room is sm else
Let’s goooooo it’s a good day
make it free
Level 5= Roblox doors 💀💀💀
Here
I can’t wait for the VR I will get it so quickly
If somehow you don’t know. The LiDAR Scanner is based off of the LiDAR mod for gmod which turns any map pitch black and gives you the half life 2 pistol that with m1 does what the scanner does in this game and the m2 scans the area making rows of those dots when it does. Pretty spooky
iOnly have a phone so how I'm supposed to play the game
That deathmoth is peak game design.
finaly
could there possibly be a mac version?
New backrooms update yay
That Scanner is very, very cool and unique indeed; great work
Bro just played the updated version the skin stealer scared the f**k outta me
I hope you make the vr support very soon, I have an Oculus Quest 2 and I have been waiting for Vr support on this game, definitely would buy it on vr.
Yes my favorite YouTuber uploaded 0:22
I love these And also there is a sub level of level 0 called level -1 or -0 it does not have much data but I think you can make it.
Level 6 is one of them. The void is the most dangerous
vr support sooner? 🥺👉👈
The meme sounds had me dying
HE ADDED THE ARMORED HAZMAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT FANCY YOUR A CHAD
YOU'RE BACK LET GOOOOOO
I feel happy every time I see your uploads
Make mobile support I don't care if it will burn my phone make it on mobile
Will the vr support be through quest or pc vr
santander en todos lados santander veranito
FINALLY A NEW BACKROOMS VIDEO YESSS!
I would like to see custom settings for procedual generation like adding the entity spawn chance and exit spawn chance
Add a sandbox mode to see and play as the monsters
Add level7
Nice intro, But i didn't see the grass like him so, uhhhhh, how?
Its always a good day when fancy uploads
Kriipiik
Ngl, the flying trucks do fit well with the level
OMG NOT FUCKING ULTRA REALISTIC BACKROOMS MOTHS
Wow, the floating truck made me jump.
Please Add Peaceful Mode
where can i get the animation of ps4 kratos falling
I got a idea you should add stanes to the Hotel Level to look like the 90s
the LIDAR implementation was GENIUS. I really wanted someone to make a game with it after seeing it in GMOD
Where can I play this
In level 94 in the floating castle where are the toy robot guards for fucks sake add them.
You should add a crafting sytem for like stuff to ptotect you
It’s insane how this guys made 10 videos yet has half a million subscribers.
Wish I could do the stuff your doing
i dont play ur game but its entertaining watching u update the game
I love this game me and my friends play it so mych
Finally new content
holy crap yessir finally an update is out! Ive been waiting so long
Vr support for quest would be sick! Like I would play it for hours with my friends
Noice
WHICH VR IS IT GOING ON IS IT ALL OF THEM
Pls add level 7
Pls add level 7
WE NEED VR SUPPORT NOW
I suggest making the walls in the boiler room white, so that it matches the image and the industrial look. Id also suggest adding a door-blocking mechanic to level 94, so that if you find a house with furniture you can block yourself in at night. Id also suggest that you add the item "wire". This item can be used to create electrical Traps in Level 3, and other uses in other levels.  I also really love that you are adding items that arent established in the Oficial wiki: gives the game a unique touch.  I have a question: Once the game is done will it become free?
How much does this game cost i forgor
now, make it in vr
You finally uploaded another
I love how i was just thinking about this channel and 10 minutes later another episode is posted
Other backrooms develog, epic.
Ball
The backrooms fell off and was ruined with monsters. the backrooms were originally empty and that was the creepy part it was rooms that didn't look real or just felt weird but it was ruined with "scary" monsters and it has truly fell off nobody really talks about it anymore it's a dead trend
i almost fell out of my chair because of this one 😂😂 3:33
Add max support
Maybe make VC toggle instead if push to talk if you havent already
Add level 4000 plz
Male death moths are actually peaceful
Xbox?
Great Work!!!
Thank you so much for all of the effort you keep putting into this game. It looks fantastic, and you’ve really reinvented (and improved) the entire game since the last update. It’s felt hard to find games that don’t feel like they’re just a cash grab lately. Looking forward to the next update!
This comment probably won’t get noticed, but when you add level 11, I would really like if there were vending machines randomly scattered around that you could noclip into which could take you to The Snackrooms (my personal favorite level) which is completely safe and even has facelings (if you plan to add facelings) as cashiers in some of the stores on the level. Thanks, and I also love your vids
Letsss goooo a fancy video
LLLEEESSSSS GGGOOO DDDAAA UUUPPPDDDAAATTTEEEEE IIIISSSS HHHEEEERRRRREEEE
you need to add more boss entitys
This game in VR would be crazy!
The update is sooo good! Please never stop working on Escape The Backrooms. It’s has HUUUGE potential. You can become the owner of a huge game franchise if you put dedication to it and hire many other game devs
Day 1069 9000 since last upload
i think smaller maps aren't bad because that saves on storage allowing for more maps.  and male deaths moths are friendly. its the female ones that are dangerous
Those moths will give me nightmares well thank you very much now I have my fair share of nightmare fuel for the next two weeks
No liminal space photos give me any feeling at all, what is this shit
I think it should be called bike game
You don’t understand how I’ve been checking in every day for almost 2 months for this vid 😃
your very cool bro (is has taken me way to long to type this i just got up froma nap)
When or if you make vr support do it on oculus because most people don’t have a pc
When or if you make vr support do it on oculus because most people don’t have a pc
I love your videos fancy they are so cool❤
I love insects so the moths are sick, literally could stop looking t them
Stop disappearing and reappear every 2-3 months man
Can you please make the on mobile
2
ah yes another backrooms video
FINALLY YOU ADDED IT I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR IT THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH FAV YT
I only had one problem with this video not long enough
Looking good! I like the scanner sombre mechanic, though i'd make the dots a lot smaller and with less "glow"; they're a bit too much i think. Perhaps i'd also add a color-distance mechanic just like in Scanner Sombre (closer dots are green while dots that generate far away when you use the tool are yellow)
Just yesterday I was watching your channel to see if you had uploaded something new, AND SUDDENLY A DAY LATER A NEW VIDEO APPEARS, THE GODS HEARD MY PRAYERS.
E
0:51 you should add a function for the funny painting of the strange man that moves when you look away while in the same room.
*truck jumpscare*
I LOVE THIS IM WATCHING THIS WHILE UPDATING THE GAME
ragarding the moths, i think there should instead of a buzzing noise, be more of a wing flapping noise.
Escape the Backrooms and Inside the Backrooms are just 2 top notch games ngl
LETS GOOO NEW UPDATE
WAIT HOW DOES THIS VID HAVE MORE LIKES THAN VIEWS NAHH WTF
Add The Level TH3 SH4DY GR3Y
Suggestion: do a slendytubbies 3 multiplayer and make a zombies type extra mode (to avoid adding guns to the main mode)
Love the series, but who's going to tell this man that "The Backrooms" hype is basically non-existent now
Bro so much work has gone into this!!! Love it! Great work!
you did not see him because it is entity number 33
It is not updateing for me
Finally a guy that creates games with memes
i love the idea of a guy in  a gas mask just walking up to a mcdonalds and it dissapearing and he's just like, "oh gosh darn! thats too bad!"
3:33 lol 😂🤣😂🤣😂 🧍🚚💨
Add a level with a escape HeLIcopTeR
I can’t go to the backrooms cuz I’m allergic to almonds.
cool. i think im sinking into the floor.
cannot wait for vr support
im still waiting for vip because i gave you 11 cad
Add night vision on level I forgot
“babe wake up fancy just uploaded a devlog
Yes a new backrooms vid yes
i hate the update only because of the electric station its so unbalanced and so so hard almost impossible to get through unless you have like 4 water cans that restore your sanity which you wont get
O remember when the first video of this was realeased and i’m very amazed that it has made it this far.Congrats!
@Largef0rest85 it is sad that you fell for scam
Can you add it to App Store?
it would be better so that the stop motion mosters actually move like if they were stopmotion
MAKE A TASK FORCE MODE IN TASK FORCE MODE YOU ARE A SCP MTF CORPRAL AND YOU NEED TO KILL AL ENTIYS THE GUNS DEAL LOTS OF DAMGE TO SMILERS AND YOU WILL GET MULTIPLAYER  AND YOU CAN SPWAN AI allies BY THE RADIO YOU CAN FIND AND YOU NEED TO AMMO TO FIRE
Ima say this.... but this guy is truly talented of what he does. I can see how much time he put into this game, and I hope you can put even more time into more maps and make the game even more scarier. Good luck man 👍
So many people in one hour
Personal request here; PLEASE add the Aranea Membri for level 0
hey fancy what software did you use to make the game?
Bro your game improved so muchh!!! idk if its because of you or somebody else who was creating this game with you but that doesnt matter. The game is not like 20 mins to rush right now after this update, the lights are perfect espesially in the big hub tunnel and the entities looks actually crazy! The only one thing i would add are more dynamic jumpscares but anyway the game is the best game i've ever seen, hope you will feel good and now i can easily say that i can wait even 5 years to get such a good update again. Thank you for that what u are doing.
cool
Your work is always inspiring!
Suggestion: Entity 666 If you don't know what entity 666 is, it is an entity that appears in any level with a computer. It disguises itself ss an exe file and when you try to download it, mistaking it for a game, it will appear in whatever game you tried to download and track you down ingame. Once it reaches you, it will jumpscare you. Then, it shuts off all the lights in your room and then it will manifest itself into a living being and proceed to jumpscare you untill you have a heart attack, If that doesn't work, it will kill you in an incredibly gory way and then delete itself and any evidence of it ever existing, and then waits for another victim to get. You can make it so you can go on the computers where you can play a game to get a big hint or a tool or something. There are 5 options and 3 are Entity 666, if you choose the wrong one, he will appear and kill you.
Good  job
Will it be free
Do by support video
It’s crazy how I watched one of your videos earlier
Cool
Great job dude you are so good at making games! Just make sure to take a break when you need to.
Where do you find all the levels? Like which wiki?
bruh is this even the backrooms anymore.. this game has literally lost all sentiments of "the backrooms"
This is sick bro, can't help but admire the animations and edits done for this video. Muy epic 😎
when you change the playermodel, plz have it so we can go back to the og if we want to.
OH GOD LIDAR
I know no ones gonna care but fancy uploaded on my birthday
I played this game a couple of months ago and it is wayyy more polished than I expected. It's actually crazy. Keep up the work, it's paying off
The Beverly room is a massive ball room
3:31 jumpscare warning lol
6:44 This animation and the sounds is weirdly realistic
You can time male death moths with almond water btw but you did a good work
I absolutely love this, there are no proper backrooms games especially for VR. 2 things though. 1. I just hope you can get Mr. Zuck to put it on oculus. 2. I'm aware you've previously said that you won't add guns, but if you feel so inclined a good way to balance guns would to make Guns uncommon, but Ammo? Ammo is precious resource that everyone in the backrooms wants, which means even 22lr. would be rare, let alone something like 45acp. Even if you were to find some it wouldn't be much, maybe 2 or 3 rounds at best or even worse, you could use empty ammo boxes as traps. Even after everything else guess what. Your Colt 45 doesn't take the 9mm you just found. Just a dumb idea.
This is the best series ever
Yes 6:42
The legend had returned
i got way to happy when i saw the new video
neat how he used the A-sync: combatative unit model for the guys fighting the boss
Great video and great work:)
the flying truck made me jump 😂
this is crazy bro, keep doin what you are doin homie Also BOSS FIGHT LETS GOOOOO
ROCK AND STONE
I have been asking in the discord a new entity PARTYPOOPERS like they went extinct yeah they werent extinct they are rare to find in most levels and their total base was level 52 and was extinct by the fun war by talking to them they are not that talkative they are just partygoers but sadder with jeans a hoodie and a blue mask sad face they dont attack you they save you from entities mostly partygoers to no-clip to a wall letting you to a random level but it is EXTREMELY RARE to find a partygoer turning into a partypooper and they just guide you
Are you going to try to make it Quest compatible or will it only be available via PC VR?
Dude your game looks amazing, please make a mobile port
Omg, please include Celsius, not everyone Is American
I wasn't expecting your video today, but you surprised me good. I'm trying to get my regimen back on track with Corona and you're releasing an update and I can't help but try it because your project intrigues me so much. I'm sure it didn't come out finished, but you work on yourself and don't give up.
You´ve done an incredible job, your game is amazing, and the fact you're doing this alone makes me know that you're very talented. PD: i'm from latinoamerica, i'm sorry if i had a gramathical mistake xd
Do level McDonald’s as a Easter egg
Yesss you are not dead
E
Wow this vid is probaly even more popular then the dream face reveal on the FIRST HOUR
Love this series bro! When I get my own gaming pc, its the first game ima buy on steam!
i think the easiest way to make a backrooms videogame is to make an engine for it, so that the comunity can easily make their own levels, make it a bit like garrys mod, let the community do the work, after all this is going to let it take way less time than for it to be made perfectly but only by one person.
The animated kind is a glowing head, and a drawn crown on it.
GOD NO PLEASE DONT ADD VR PLEASE NO
I instantly got happier the moment I saw this on my recomended
My day is 2x better when this dude uploads ngl
By the way Your a good environment artist Fancy Keep the good work
I'm guessing the classified level at the end is Level 9.
No one is looking at this comment
I'm not even interested in the game, I just like your entertaining update videos.
The Name of the Game makes it harder to specifically select @Fancy's Backrooms in YouTube Search Engine. YouTube always recommended me Roblox, not YouTubers playing @Fancy's Backrooms.
what, the, fu-
The dogs that you are supposed to blind are op I feel like a toddler vs a pitbull
hes alive
3:22  he being such an NPC😂
Its like a new game, Awesome!
What’s your discord
THE FUCKING TRUCK SCARED THE SHIT OUT OF ME
If I saw my dad after he went to buy the milk in the backrooms personally I wouldn't let that slide
i like this update
With the vr support are you gonna be able to add standalone support or no
Fancy, I hate you. you used bee sounds For the moths and I just had a heart attack ❤️‍🩹 edit: I still love this though
Can you make for android please
BRO FINALLY BRO THX BRO BEST ONE YET 😂
Just came here after spending a whole hour playing the new update and it's insane. I doubt even whole corporations can make these masterpieces
LETS GOOO
The scariest part about this whole game: Flying Truck Jumpscare
HE! DID! IT!
Your game is supa dupa oopa trupa cool
Can you release it on Play station?
love what yout doining here
oh sweet jesus vr support of inside the backrooms ;-;
You should make a map with survive and tripods that are from 2005
#GokuOmni
Nice, can’t wait to play it!
for the love of god,please make smilers not just a face
🥖
Are you planning to make this game come to console?
finally
Cool cool, astounding even, except... some people (me) might find the moths kinda triggering, i know God allows even nastier creatures to exist, but these things truly belong in hell, if anywhere at all. You told me to look away and i didn't listen, huge mistake.
what about procedurally generated maps?
ayyyy he blessed us with another video
i literally ate 50 minutes ago took a 10 minute shower AND I AM LATE 1 HOUR For this update
Add level 69 it’s an infinite highway with monsters that grab you if you get out of your car
finally
Add need the ad back rooms level 4000 higher than the highest level unknown backrooms waffle level -7
OOOOOOOOOOOHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
Good way to start off 2023. 🤝
BRO THIS ITOUR GAME????
Good video
I hear that banger song by Future Joust playing in the background!
You do not know how happy I get when you upload a new backrooms video, keep up the work fancy! 😎
This guy is Like dani
Man your absolubtly underrated
finally, it is here!
bro I was literally going to say if u can add this to oculus(quest 2) and make a better player model(its good) but you already planned that
Did you know that one of the gender of death moth is timetable with almond water
how do i get into level fun
It would have been TONNES cooler if you just did the wiki backrooms instead of kane pixels terrible one
Honey wake up, Fancy just posted
add my custom level    LEVEL SEPY TEMBERY  ELENTHY  ITS rated 5 bcuz entity count is 2 but the entitys are 2 very dangerus planesthey killed almost 3000 wanderas a day and have a 2001 look of inside of the towers
Why has nobody made a video with these updates?
THIS IS AMAZING
Make it so that you can pick up the weapons that are dropped from the wretches
For Level 6, I thought it was like a water cooling facility with everything made of tiles and there being tons of water, some maintenance shafts with pipes, and the main water cooling towers which you would use to escape. The image I saw this from was nightvision as well.
My dude doesn't even need to add VR support. There is a game in VR called noclip VR, and it's basically your game
you could add the gamemaster and he gives you minigames like a boss or level thalasophobia
Yes
Make level 7 and 8 please!
Is level 4 in it yet?
Most anticipated video of the year 🎉
Welcome to episode 560 of me making my game escape from the backrooms. Today we are adding level 3729462947 and it's going to be epic
WHAT THE QUANDEL DINGLE!!! I LOVE IT!!!
Hes back with Another great video!
KEEP MAKING THIS GAME also why is no one on for co op
You should try to make your own level. The game looks great btw!
You should make a lobby dude
1 star review. I got stuck in this yellow-walled empty maze room thing and now I can't get out. Please fix this glitch immediately.
The legends back
This game is starting to look really good keep up the work cant wait to see when the game will completed  :)
Let’s gooooo!!!
Bro I love you Ive always wanted an EPIC backrooms game like this!
Also will the game be quest compatible like will it be on the quest store so I dont have to sideload or airlink?
I can't wait until this game gets vr support I'm gonna be playing it every day dude. That is of it's free
Finally. Another one here we go. Thank you for the hard work my man! ❤
Fun fact: you can tame MALE ONLY MALE death moths (with almond water) but not female death moths male ones are smaller and female ones are bigger and more dangerous
"Fancy's Dad"
Is this a vr or pc game
WE NEED PROXIMITY CHAT
love the new update amazing job!
W
how come you always do the scp 096 sound effect
I love the video it was awesome also it's my birthday
I cant wait for VR support. :)
I know this could definitely be something down the line, but a player based level creation system would definitely ease development as well as allow the community to go wild
Does the game have single player?
new upload nice :)
LOVE THESE VIDS WATCHED ALL OF THEM
noice
this was uploaded on my bday :)
Yesss
early
Rope so cool bro I can’t wait for level seven
You need to do some tutorials on how to do this stuff!
YES FINALLY  Edit: I do understand that you took a lot of time with this game, and you made it alone. So I shouldn't have been like "OMG HE FINALLy MADE IT AFTER 4 MONTHS", that was stupid I should think
Bro I got a game and on my oculus and it’s called no clip vr and it’s the back rooms and its really fun but you should still make it on vr and on PlayStation, Xbox
Looks nice and sounds amazing
i love the game but we need party poopers
Definitely gonna get the game after this
can you add party poopers?
what about mobile support MHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
i think you would fancy a comment
Luv U
👍
Bro you are actually making my dream game tysm
Wow here in 1h
YIPPPEEEEEEEE!
Add a cod zombies map as a level
It's been too long
The game is more realistic than bob's mom.
POV he barely post we’ll forget about him😂
i love the new update and your funny edits
Fancy for level 6 those radar things that map out the room with blue dots should also maybe put red? Dots on the wretches while they are near you or something? I think that might be cool
I like the idea of guns were you could kill entities like wretches that can actually be killed with guns but there’s a Limited capacity so you have to find more bullets like you have to find almond water and if you shoot at something like a smiler the bullet would just go throw or if you shot at a howler then it would just bounce off with some sparks like if you shot at Metal intimidating the player even more knowing that if they shot at the entity it would just bounce off or go through or hit it and do nothing
ziot8wyr
I love you and your work and hope you take my advice not to use steamVR to add vr support and instead make it .Apk that can be used on oculus
I like cheese can you do something with cheese
Fancy is my new favorite game dev because Dani stopped uploading
I just posted a vid before I watched this lol
Dude I downloaded your game on my phone and got to the level where pig flies into the air and then it crashed and didn't even save. Fix your freaking game! Already unsubscribed because of this...
Fancy is an amazing YouTuber, he is sure to blow up in the near future
YESSS
FINALLY I MYSLEF LOVE YOUR CONTENT!
Fancy can go months without making a video and when he finally does, he gets millions of views. Good job Fancy.
Yoo new vid
So cool
Almost everyone in comments: I love how fancy is a hard worker. Me: I like how I can almost finally get McDonalds in the backrooms.
This game just keeps getting better and better, we bought it with my friends and will be playing tonight
Ive waited so long for this finally amazing
Yes a new video
YES
Much people was waiting for this awesome video king keep it up
54m early
Really awesome vid man! I don't have a PC so I can't play it yet but I'm looking forward to seeing it on VR, do you think it would be put on the oculus app lab? I know that that's a lot harder than it sounds but I still hope so. Can't wait to see what you do with this amazing game!
You should try to make the game more psychological horror
he’s back😊
Banger
I like how more than half of his videos have the same exact thumbnail just with a different background
Floating trucks are now part of the new lore
Here within hour gang
Add the hive level
You are a god, best game ever made 🙌
If you could make this a vr game that would be the best horror vr game ever (never mind I saw like half way in your adding vr support I can twait
FINALLY
I am the 620th comment
Nice and Oh you know you should do when the insanity gose to down into wretches too  and spawn where you die from instantly
Yay more backroom
Make it on oculus quest 2 so people that have those and not pc or laptops can play and put it on the store when the update comes out because I have a oculus quest 2 and I just got a cable and you need a cable air link is dog dodo
Hmmm, closer to having access to firearms I see.
Bro when the flying truck came towards the camera at the speed of light I literally died
thanks for the continued development x
how long it did you edit the video
Omg awsome🤩 me and my brothers play this game together and always check updates for new map🤩🤩
And multiplayer modes you can make it so that each player has a different colored marker
Sing for the Laughter sing for the tears
cant wait
Maybe make a sandbox mode where you can turn into entities    Мимикрией семь бакс май уикенд тюлень тюлень
First game developer that listens to their community
I like your videoa
hey, male deathmoths can be tamed, according to the wiki. why not make a system to tame them and you can apply certain things to thme to buff you, like less sanity drain and stuff
ok the male death moths can be tamed and the female one is well its not freindlly
I love how I found this guy when he had 32k subs and now that number has been obliterated
Add level 11 the endless city
yes!!!!!!!!!!
Any vid by you is dope :D
the player character model always looks so tense with them shoulders, He needs a severe massage.
yes!!!!!!!!!!!
yes!!!!!!!!!!!1
3:31 Is that the battle bus
Hello!
Finally a new video!
Sorry I was haff way watching 😂😅
finally a new video!!!!!!
I’m happy he is adding vr cuz I asked on the second video of his game
pp shart
I’ve been waiting for this
lets gooooooo
bro noclip vr is a good game don't know if that is yours but probably not better than your vr backrooms
8:50 ngl this guy dumb af because he said he downloaded it on his phone but in a past vid, fancy already said that he would not put it on mobile and what kinda backrooms game have pig files? And his game crashed probably because he has a iPhone 4 💀💀💀💀 so fancy does not have to fix his game, but LargeF0rest85 has to fix his brain
Does anyone know how Fancy did the procedural generation
you gonna give VR players heart attacks 💀💀
¨The King, in his standard form appears as a twisted and corrupted stone statue wielding a sword and donning a crown known simply as Machination, however, he does not stay in this form for long. The King can shift and change to become what you think of him. If you think he’s a lion, he’ll become a lion. If you think he’s a pathetic, whimpering insect, then he will become exactly that.¨
im thinking how im going to beat this AND next update cause next levels are 8 and 9 which are very unsafe
Here at 45 min
tbh it just looks like my neighbourhood
Have you ever thought of console support? I mean I know it would probably be hard-
This game is the best
HE BACK
Yay
Wait, just noticed you added an aim dot. Not really fond of this idea, it takes away immersion especially in pitch black environments
Oh I have announced that it is put right now and I love this game!!!
procedural generation makes games feel less "handcrafted" in my opinion
Hey fancy, i think the animated king is a dark figure with the top part of a king's clothes and the down part looks like is just bones
I hate that people are telling him to add features like sanity and other things that make other backrooms games not fun and his game different.
Making 3 of my friends get this rn
LESSS GOO
Great backrooms series keep up the work Supa proud of ya
Ahhhhhhh 12/10 MORE MORE  MORE
I like the three year old drawing of the partygoer ring me back or else I will cry Cause I am a kid
I’ve waited so long for a 9 minute video!?!?
I have a theory that this guy is dani and is secretly uploading in his secret channel because not only his voice is similar to him but also dani said he is working on a project that could be this game.
Sadly I can’t get the game, so in the future, when your game is even more advanced, can you play it later in the future?
vb  bjm b
I have announced that fancy is updating level fun so stay tuned for FUN and PARTY for the game to be realistic. This take the game a while.
That flying truck actually fucking scared me
1:37 Wait... male deathmoths have turned hostile all of a sudden? Ehhh.. who cares its his game.
Great video man ! Keep it up it’s so nice to see a developer who keeps in touch with his community!
God no please don’t add vr support because then i will have to play it cuz i can’t resist (pls do it)
THIS IS JUST WHAT THE WORLD NEEDS
Epic
40 minutes ago :)
Yes
Yeah I'm sorry to say this but another game called enter the backrooms has already done this it's nothing new and has way better gameplay than your game ever will and it doesn't piggy back off the backrooms ARG 💀
The lightAR scanner seems a bit too bright, it takes away a lot of the spooky from the game v-v
I love this game I’m on the discord
IVE BEEN WAITING SO LONG FOR THIS VID, and its finally here Btw love your game and vids
Is the red level is very hard
There is only one problem. The pool rooms exit is the same for everyone Nad I want the exit to be random for everyone.  ●Extend the pool rooms. ●Now that they have flashlight they can see the dark rooms so add it with entities. ●Add better lighting
That deathmoth joke… it was so funny lmao.
Can we take a moment to appreciate how much this guy is doing. He’s creating this SUPER realistic backrooms game. IVE WRITTEN A WHOLE BOOK ABOUT IT LIKE BRUH 😭
COOLLLLL
This guy just casually makes the best videos
Finally
Can u make VR free so me and my freinds can actually do something
Oh
Can you add this game on VR please!!!!🥺🥺🙏🏻
520th ha
Ues
I'd recemend not adding a lot of entitys it makes the game seem A LOT less Liminal
i play this game almost every day
about time!
When is this game update going to be released
LETS GO!
you can actually cover yourself in moth jelly and the male death moths wont notice you and maybe try to protect you. but that wont save you from the female ones. and i would suggest crafting items made with moth jelly.
backrom gud
nice
PLEASE KEEP UPDATING THIS GAME IS LEGENDARY
Very nice fame soooo sick
The animated king in his default form is a giant contorted Statue of a rocks and holds a sword and wears a crown called "the magination" he can talk and can mind control wanderers Idea:  add a animation of him showing up and disappearing into confetti then between points within the boss fight he changes into phobias like at one point he is a clown but at another He turns into a giant spider and then a ghost and then the unknown which yes is an actual phobia And randomly the players have to rapidly press space, and the ones that fail temporarily are controlled by ai and become unable to control their player character and become agro at the other players
I LOVE THIS AGME AAA
Good work. You have good dedication.
FINALLY AFTER probably 3 months
Bro act like his game didn't become the best horror game of the last 2 years
Let’s goooooooooooooooooooooo
Wow You really put work. You deserve the likes... Never give up.
Finally an update
Will there be a console port of the game?
Bro I wanna play this so bad but I’m broke
I love your videos can you It's called Eternal Ballroom Update Please 🥺
Is it free now or no?
The female are the dangerous one while the males are friendly
ADD SURVIVAL AND MAKE IT A BIG THING YOU CAN JOIN WHERE EVERYONE CAN JOIN AND GO TO LEVELS TOGETHER! Like when you click on multiplayer you join a big server with everyone possible in it. Even if it’s only 4 people I think that would be the best way to make it seem like the real backrooms experience. So basically waiting rooms wouldn’t exist. It would just be joining it
Wow
Nice
Claim ur here within an hour ticked here  ⬇️
FINALLY😭😭
hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
Hi
YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO btw can u do a gamemode to play hide and seek  so u can kill your friends
good job
Hell yes
just downloaded the new update! you have insane talent man keep it up!
Nice
Holy
You should have added to Xbox
Please make more updates it brings me joy and heart attacks
Bro, this game is getting so damn good.  I already considered the best Backrooms game I have played and now I don't think anything can beat it!
add level !-!
Another update finally
I can't wait for coryxkenshin to play this
I’ve been waiting so long
Look behind you.
finnallly
Maybe give the animated king a lil crown?
finally new video also cool updates
I've seen people really hate that fun level.
nice
Thanks we needed this
We need more entities, just saying also I love this series and this game, You have been doing a great job and hopefully you and up making the perfect game.
bean seal
I wish you make on Consol as well
I love the content
Lets goooooooo fancy upload
Fancy..... Please for the love of everything HOLY make level "end" EASIER. I spent 4 hours on it and couldn't beat it. PLEASE MAKE IT EASIER!!!
great content! I LOVE IT
nice work, it shows that you put in the effort and playing the game you deserve a little rest.
Hi
pls add lvl 14 (paradise) the consept is so cool
I love how good and detailed this is. This must be hard day for ya. Keep it up! Also you should probably do something I should suggest like backrooms corrupted memory or something. I'm pretty sure that's what it's called. We like games like creepy but just a suggestion.
Once the game is completed, so in a while considering game making takes time, you should add workshop support, people could make their own levels!
Very cool but when field of wheat?
This is amazing because I was just heading off then u get this ping, its almost mid night so I'm watching this no matter what, that's for making enjoyable content for us.
remember to add safe apartments you can find, but there are deathmoths are in some apartments
Just bought the game looking forward to playing it :D
The backrooms game is looking good :) really looking forward to the end results!
Are you adding it to the quest store? Because I don’t have enough money for PC Vr plus I don’t have a PC.
You should add the Hub World. For explorers
Loving it!
bro is carrying the fandom
nice
i love this series and im downloading your game!
I love fancy you work so hard and do so well you got this also I think you should have kept the flying trucks!
Finally
i am here
More l3vels and entitys
25 min
Fancy is on his way to become one of the most successful backrooms game creators out there.
The animated king kinda looks like bacteria but with a crown
YOOO
Boi this was 25 minutes ago!
It not easy to create those backdoor game. But still great work as long people like to talk about it.
YESSS
can you add Level 188
Currently enjoying and uploading videos of the update! Thanks for the update!
Dodo fart
I wonder when it will come out
Please add more
You are a Legend
I hope this game will succeed!
bro   this game sucks! (joke)
YOOOOO
Awesome
21 minutes cant wait to watch this
PLEASE redo the animations and animated king. If you read the wiki, animations are more claymation-like and the animated king is whatever you think he is, which you sort of got right. All in all, great work keep it up!
Yooooo
Every time I see one of your video's be uploaded i know my day is perfect keep up the effort man!
I tried the game it is actually really fun
Dude its so cool to see how far your game has come! From the original popular levels with simple popular entities to this! I love to see single developers put everything into their game to make it the best it can be.
Yo?
I wished u uploaded more often, this slaps!
hi
3:17 💀
Lol
i love this game so much and i love the content it has thank you fancy for one of my favourite games
Hay can you ad level 69 it has a cool spatial enteti
Incredibly good work
I feel like watching this early is a privilege
Add a beta test server
I cannot wait for vr support
that entity was scared when he saw kratos
Why is M3gan’s brother in the back rooms
Hi got to this in 13 mins lol 😂
yayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy a new vid
ur game is really good!
If you add Level-232 to your game with the entity that comes with it I'll buy your game on steam no cap. (here's the video of inspiration: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUupPGSvtjU&t=23s&ab_channel=Ruster)
bro is using the mobile horror clown
Add more sublevels
Add squirt gun (object-19)
One of my favourite horror game
i need help with getting the code for the elevator in level 1
If you're going the procedural generation route, there is One Golden Rule you Must abide.  Always make sure there is a route from start to finish.  So many procedural games cut into their own geometry and end up blocking the exit path, making the it impossible to egress.  Don't do that.
If you do vr please do oculus quest because i want to play your game but i don't have a PC  TY
that one classified thing looks like gm_russia
if you want game realistic make it when you die make it your camera goes on the ground randomly then go to the death screen to make it look like the person filming the tape has died and cant grab on to the camera and falls and the camera is randomly fell
14 mins ago!
Am watching this 14 min after release
gg
The first video that I see:
I was surprised not to see another "But I'm not an environment artist soooo..." followed by a really good looking environment
You need to add the Beast of Level 5 and Growlers to Level 5
My dad bought this game lol
I love the effort put into this game
fancy... about vr there is already a game that looks a lot like yours but in vr called noclip vr just to say
Here b4 an hour
0:06 were sorry kratos
Brooo this game would be perfect for the vrrr
I miss the light head entity =(
Omg scp 096
The lidar isn't unique though. It was widely popular on Garry's Mod for awhile there. I hope that's where you got the idea.
this is amazing
This is so amazing, good job with this new update ;)
Keep up the hard work! In the future, this would be alot of work, but, in the future can you make this VR compatible. If not that’s fine, base game is scary enough lol.
8:48 that lil liar
More backrooms
Was worried this project was abandoned thank god he’s back
WOO
i was just watching ur videos and 10 mins later he comes out with this banger danger
👍👍👍🙂
of course you release it when im in bed and about to sleep (by sleep i mean watch youtube until i fall asleep) like WHYYYY
mad respect for the amount of work that went into this
It’s so crazy seeing all this work come to life! You probably have the best visualisation of the back rooms I’ve seen
Amazing vid, keep up the good work!
LETS GO THANK YOU
6:18 I think LIDAR.EXE is a cool game
IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS!!! I got a banger to watch
very nice.
Hell yeah watch ISHOWSPEED play this and actually get scared for once
i love your work x)
With the insanity thing it is said that people turn into wretches in the backrooms which are absolutely terrifying and it would be cool if your friend dies in multiplayer from insanity they could turn into a wretch and hunt down their other friends using their voice cool idea no? Edit: I see that you added wretched but it would be cool if you could hunt your friends as them if you die
Best back rooms game ever lmao
i love this series!  keep up the good work!
Addimg guns will make it lore friendly and accurate
first
yes another vid :)))))))))
HEWWO:3
0:09 welcome to esceep the backrooms
Love the dedication, keep up the hard work! Awesome backrooms game!!!
It’s here?
Finally I new update
pineapples
i don't get how he casually makes the backrooms in a couple of months. true commitment.
Level 94 looks pretty cool! i wpuld reccomend removing clouds in the next update though, it makes the level look more like a fake prop set in an old movie which would really add to the creep factor!  also level 6 looks absolutley gorgeous.   LEVEL 9 LESS GOOO!
coming from a person with no knowledge on game development:  good job
I feel like people will tell fancy to change level 94 even tho it dosent look like the cutscene level 94 it still looks sick, but i feel like the cutscene for level 94 is more accurate
siht yub thgim I mmH
honey wake up, fancy uploaded
2 minutes  here
Scp lite wiki right there.
Will you ever add firearms into the game? I know it sounds bad, but...
nice
he's back lets go
