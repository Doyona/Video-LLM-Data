For those of you reading this comment, it's okay, it's normal to feel lonely sometimes, if you're going through tough times, keep trying, but never give up,
I have not seen or watched you guys in a while, cove has grown so much since the last time i watched your videos; I can’t really remember the last time I watched you two!!
Rewatching again and I love it! Can you relink your hoodie? <3
Omg. What beautiful family!!
Cove saying “Uuuuuupppp” while Parker is finding out is the CUTEST
awwhhh were all crying now!!! So excited for yall!
When he said how I about died.  🤣🤣🤣 You know what you did Parker.  😂😂😂 That was hilarious.
Congrats!!!! I was pregnant with my daughter while you were pregnant with Cove, and now I’m pregnant with #2 while you are! ❤️ I thought CERTAIN it would be a boy but turns out it’s another girl! Yay for babies!!!
Awwww congratulations you two! ❤️
Omg i had a feeling that they might be pregnant again! Congrats Y’all ☺️
Happy 25th Birthday Aspyn. I believe that everyone should have the best birthday that they can in this new year in a safe way and that includes you. So have an amazing birthday today.
8:16-17 cove says “crazy”😩😍she’s so cute
We just found out that we are pregnant on baby number 2 as well!!
I'm so happy for you aspyn and parker ❤️.
Congratulations on baby #2!
You two! I’m so happy for your family!
I’ve been a little suspicious for a while because it’s not really like you guys to miss videos or skip a couple days completely in a vlog & that kept happening! I didn’t say anything because the pregnant comments always annoy me, like it’s not really anyone’s business.  But now that you guys are announcing it, I’m super happy for you! I’ve been watching since the days when your channel was called hautebrilliance and it’s so fun to watch your family grow! Baby number 2 is going to be so cute, congratulations!
The most honest reaction I love it
You guys are trending #6!!!!
Awww this was so adorable congratulations you guys I think it’s a boy 2 of my cousins had boys and my brother has a little boy so I’m team boy for sure love y’all❤️
congratulations!!
Ahhh we knew😍😍😍 CONGRATS

Why didn’t my husband cry both times I told him 😒😅😅
y’all can’t make me cry on my break at work omg😭
This was def one of the best reactions ever! I legit laughed! I love it!!
I found your channel when you told Parker you were pregnant with Cove, i have watched all of your videos since and love you guys so so much. Congratulations 🎉 ❤️❤️
YAYAYYAYAYAYAYAYYAYAYYAYAYAYYAAYYYYYYYYY
Omg!!! Congrats!!!!!
Congratulations! I'm so happy for you guys!
OMG so excited congratulations:D
Awhhh congrats you guys!! I'm due in September with my second as well!!!
I should not be doing my makeup while watching this 😂
Knew ittt! Congratulations 💓
I so happy🦋❤️🦋
Congratulations! 💖 Parker made me cry 🥺
Congratulations guys 💓💓💓
We’re due the same month!!!
Definitely think you’ll be having another girl
Congratulations! 💙💗 totally agree on not saying anything before someone's actually annouced 👶( I did have a feeling though from your Easter Instagram story with a well placed banner 😜🥳) x
Love how Parker said “YOURE pregnant?” as if Cove could have been the one to take the test 😂
100% agree with you about your husband not being able to go in with you for your appointments (they also don’t allow kids in, which makes it hard when you don’t have anyone to leave your baby with). I hope that all changes soon too! Happy for you all!
I remember feeling pretty crappy early 2019 and your video of finding out you were pregnant came up on my recommend list. I wasn’t even a subscriber back then. I watched it and thought that maybe I should do a pregnancy test too. The next morning I found out I was pregnant!! Nine months later I had TWINS!! You’re right to be scared because two is A LOT of work, but it’s also so so so much fun!! Not only will you make memories with your children but now they’ll make memories with each other. All the best 💕
I STARTED CRYING WHEN PARKER STARTED CRYING
Congrats! Such a nice family🤩
Congratulations! ❤️❤️
Ahhh the baby might be born on my birthday, wow this makes me soo happy to follow along with your second baby! I remember when cove was still in your tummy! 🥺❤️
I TOLD YOUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU ASPYN CRAVING FOR CHIPS IS PREGNANT ASPYN IM SO HAPPYYYYY
STOPPPP 😍😍🙂🙂🥰🥰🥰
Congratulations!!
Aspyn I was literally just thinking about you guys on my drive home and I was like  I need to check on them I haven’t had time for YouTube for a couple of weeks. And I open my YouTube and this is the first video I see. I’m so happy for you al and praying for you always! Congratulations so happy for you
Parker: "HOW?!!" Aspyn: "What do you mean how?!?!" hahah loved the reaction! congrats !
Really hoping for a girl!!! I’ve replayed Parker’s reaction so many times 😭
It’s a boy for sureeee
NO WAY!!! OH EM GEEEE IM SO HAPPY FOR YOU GUYS!!!!!
Aspyn makes a good point about spamming people with pregnant assumptions. Some people go through mischarges and it really affects them so please respect people and their personal lives
I am so so happy for you both 😭and Parker’s reaction made me cry happy tears! but yeah, seeing everyone constantly comment how you had to be pregnant BEFORE you were actually pregnant was so annoying and rude.
Parker's reaction. Priceless.
OMG THEYLL BE A LIBRA!!!
Parker crying makes my heart melt :,)
I love Parker's reaction and his "HOW??" --I'm chuckling as I say to myself, "Welllll...the same way you got the one in pigtails right here!" HA! HA!! Congratulations to you all!!!
I KNEWW ITTT!!!! congrats 🥰🥰🥰 i gasped so loud when i read the title
Congrats!!!!
Congrats!!! Yeah going from 1-2 is a huge adjustment especially for the first born! Buuuut it’s so true that having 2 is a lot more fun. Especially seeing the two babies adore each other so much. ❤️
Awe I’m due October 7th for my first baby. So excited for you guys!!
OK. Now that is the cutest way to tell him have your daughter give him the test. Love it. Adorable. Congratulations. Love you guys.
So exciting. Congrats you guys
Yayayay!!! I’m also due October!! So fun watching these and following your journey. God bless you guys ❤️
Parker starting to cry .... omg I love it
He cried omg I’m melting 🥺🥺🥺 congrats
Thank you for that Aspyn I've been with my fiancee for 14 years I have Endometriosis, We've tried for years the first question everyone always ask is when are you getting married and why don't you have any kids.. My heart breaks every single time.....
Congratulations
It's Cove's world we're just living in it <3 Congrats guys! :)
To think I watched your old cheerleading makeup tutorials and now you’re having a second baby! My goodness you guys I’m so so happy for you both!
I always wait for someone to tell me they're pregnant before I say anything. Someone assumed I was pregnant once and I'm on the plump side and was having the most horrible bloating. Was already a horrid day thinking of how I looked before that was piled on.
Awww parkers reaction had me in tears myself. I love this family💕💕
Yay CONGRATS Aspyn, Parker, and Baby Cove! She is going to be the best big sister so excited for you all!!
Two is easy! Three? Three is killer. Might as well have 6 once youre outnumbered. 😅
So I was thinking about you guys this morning and wondering if you guys were gunna have another baby soon (for some reason)  & then I saw your announcement on Instagram this afternoon. I was shook that I pretty much predicted it. So while I was watching this video I had the strongest feeling that you were going to have a boy and he was going to look just like Aspen!
parker’s reaction omg🥺🥺🥺
parker’s reaction omg🥺🥺🥺
I am so happy for you guys!!
omg the way parker cried 🥺🥺🥺❤️
I hope you enjoy every ultrasound with Parker.
THANK YOU FOR THE PSA!! People really need to think before they speak. It's extremely hurtful and painful to get those comments if you've been trying or if you've lost a baby. And really it's no one's business so just please don't ask. I don't even ask my sisters or best friends that. I'm here when they need me.
Soooooo f-ing excited!!!!
Yey congrats I am so happy for you guys cannot believe you are having baby yey
Parker crying made me cry, so sweet. Love following y'all on this journey🥺
KNEW IT! Congratulations ❤️❤️
You had a super easy labor and delivery so hopefully it’ll be like that again 🤞🏻
AAAAAAAAA BIG SIS COCO 😭😭😭
So happy for y’all 😭 not me tearing up during dinner while watching this 😂❤️
"YOU'RE pregnant?!" no parker, cove is. HAHAHHA i melted
Congratulations!   I totally agree about not assuming people are pregnant or when they're gonna have a baby. I met someone the other day who knows my husband and he said "So do you guys have kids yet?" And I said no and he said "Well, why not??" And I didn't know what to say I was just like "Ummm... my body?" And I think he got the hint and left it alone. I've been TTC for over 5 years and it's a super sensitive subject for me. I swear I could've instantly cried when I had to explain
Wthhhh i kinda suspected it!! Omg😍 Congratss🥰
I’m so happy for you are you going to get the gender revealed early?
Aww such good news 🙈
OMGGGG IM CRYINGGGGGG!!!! Congratulationsssss
Congratulations 😭❤️
Aww!! That reaction was the sweetest!
The cutest reactions ever🌸🌸🌸
Congratulations 🎉🍾❤️💕
As soon as I saw your insta post I immediately thought the bebes was a boy!! 🦋
I love you guys!!!
Congratulations guys!!!
Where do you get the cheap tests? I need that because I keep buying ones like you have
Omg I knew it!!! The last few videos I watched I totally sensed you were pregnant. So excited for you both 🥰
AWWW PARKER’S REACTION WAS SO CUTE
Parker’s voice cracked and I started SOBBING lmao 💀
I just knew it! 🥰
I SWEAR just yesterday youtube recommended the video of you guys finding out Aspyn was pregnant with Cove and today you announced baby #2
Do you have a tattoo on your stomach?
so exciting!!! I KNEW ITTTTT
I found out im pregnant today
So happy for you guys! Congrats!! You r blessed with 2 babies.
the comments about you being pregnant were so astonishing to me lol  but CONGRATS 🎊🎉💕 so happy for you
I hope it’s a boy! But girl would be great for cove! My mom was sicker with the boys and less with the girls, so who knows!
Congrats ! Also we need a makeup tutorial for this look !!
Congratulations! I just have to tell you how crazy it is... we were pregnant together last time you had your daughter almost exactly a month before I had mine! I’m also pregnant with baby number two and am due in October as well! We just got our genetic testing back and found out we are having another little girl! 🎀
CONGRATULATIONS!
Parker’s reaction is so sweet 🥺 ! btw congrats I’m so happy for you guys !! 🥰
Congratulations guys. Literally soooo so so happy for you guys ❤️
I cried when Aspyn and Parker cried 😭❤️
I was about to push and idk if anything is going to come out 😆🤣🤣
Wow Cove looks exactly like Parker I’m sorry Aspyn
Congrats guys! Oh you'll do great! The transition to 2 was a lot easier than the transition to 1 for me. Hope it works out that way for you! Yah! Praying for a healthy pregnancy!
I KNEW you were pregnant - you sounded so out of breath in previous vlogs!  Congrats!!!
Parker’s reaction made me crack up😂
So cute!!!!!!!!!🥲 🤣
Sooo cute when Parker was crying 😭😭😭 Love you guys, congrats soooo happy for you 😍😍😍
How? Oh my dear, we all know :P haha congrats!!! I'm waiting for my little one in Aug!!
"How?" well you see Parker when a man and a women love each other very much.. AHAHAHAH
So so happy!!! Congratulations!
why am i crying!!!??? haha!
I noticed you were so short of breath!!! I knew you were pregnant and was certain the announcement was coming! Congratulations!!!!!
If my man doesn’t ugly cry like Parker I don’t want him 🤰🏻💕🤣
I love on her Instagram she answered a question that they were trying and then Parker “how?” Like uhhh sir I believe you know how 😂  Congrats guys!
wow, I had absolutely no clue this time .. Congrats you guys!!
Omg when Parker found out! So cute ❤️ but also I’m dying at “HOW??” Like Parker... we all know how babies are made 🤪🤣
Congrats💕 1-2 was totally fine. Was my third that had us like whoa 😆
Yay omg congratulations! I can’t wait to following along your journey with pregnancy and baby number 2
PARKER: “I am not ready for two”  “That’s why I’m crying”  😂😂😂😂😂😂
OMG OMG OMG YESSSS I suspected this was coming soo hard. I would be watching your videos and just go:"Aspyn is glowing, she has to be pregnant" I KNEW IT!!!! And, btw, congrats!!!
Such graceful energy from you two 🥰
I have a feeling it's twins
I’m due in September!! Good to see someone with me! If your insurance allows you can go to a clinic that lets the husband come in. I chose my doctor based on that.
CONGRATS!
Also I was SOOOO sick and had a ton of food aversions in my first trimester and slept a ton. And I have two boys so I’m team boy!!! 🧐🙏🏽💙
Stop it omg ya yay!!!!!!!! I’m so excited
"YOU'RE pregnant?" No Parker, Cove is. LOL
So sweet, you guys are going to do great. I am due with my third in October, so I can't wait to go through this at the same time as you :)
congrats!
Parker: how? Aspyn: what do you mean 🤣🤣🤣😭😭😭
congratulations! so excited for the future vlogs :)
Omg congratulations guys
Omg I can’t believe this!!! Congratulations!
Omg at 8:16 it sounds like Cove says “crazy” and then giggles! Congratulations!!! So happy for you guys!! I’ve been here since your channel was called hautebrilliance!! So it’s so crazy to have grown up with you and now seeing your beautiful family grow! Much love❤️
I have a question Aspen and Parker where is the baby’s room gonna be and what if it’s a boy what color is his stuff gonna be
CONGRATS! So so happy for u guys!! I cried when parker found out! 🌸🎉❤️🎈
Parker crying right away 😭😭😭😭😍😇
I had a feeling she was pregnant
Y’all gave us a huge clue at the end of the last vlog with the scene where lily gets a positive pregnancy test I couldn’t help but watch it while Parker was talking and was very suspicious
I had someone ask me why I wasn’t pregnant yet since I had been married for a few months but she didn’t know I had just lost a baby a few weeks before
Yep your definitely having a boy 🥺😍
Congrats to the both of you!! ❤️ And my gosh, Aspyn cracks me up she can never keep a straight face for the life of her 🤣🤣🤣 I knew she was gonna do some sort of smirk or grin if Parker came near HAHAHA
I hope now Aspyn will have her mini-me too!!
Being more nauseous you are is an old wives tale of having a boy!! 💙💙
convinced it’s a boy !!! would be so cute too !!
Parker made me cry, best husband ever 🥺
WAS NOT PREPARED TO CRY TODAY 😭
Congratulations
I was smiling so big the entire video. I’m so so happy for you guys!!! Can’t wait to see the journey 💕💕
Love you guys your such great parents good luck for #2
Omg!! Thats exciting 😊😊🤍🤍 God bless & praying for a healthy baby ✨❤️❤️
parkers reaction was so sweet
Congratulations! I can’t wait to see your family grow even more. Cove is going to love her baby sibling! 😊
Congrats!! I’m just a little bit behind you with my second also! ❤️
We were pregnant the same time last time you were pregnant and now we are again! I’m due the end of September. And my 2nd daughter and Cove are only 3 days apart.
Parker🥺 love you guys so much
You too will be fine I have two boys and they are 15 1/2 months apart and I would not of changed anything!😀
So exciting! I checked their IG the other day because I had a weird feeling there would be a baby update, idek what made me think that but seeing this I realize I was just jumping the gun!
It made me so happy when aspyn reached and hugged Parker when he started to cry. So many YouTubers are more bothered about getting the shot than comforting their partner. I'm so excited for you both xx
Congrats!! I had no idea and was so shocked at your Instagram post!!
Jennim being pregnant and now you!!! AMAAAAZING!!! I’m so so happy for y’all 🥰🥺

I was wondering why you haven't been vlogging as much and it didn't even occur to me that you might be pregnant until the last vid where everybody was commenting it.  I didn't expect it so quickly after Cove.  Congrats! Loved Parker's reaction.
OH MY GOODNESS YAY!!!
