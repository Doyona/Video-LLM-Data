Who is using Code "Postboxpat" in the shop. #-EpicPartner! I really hope this video helps you out!
Hella cap
He ain't even there neither is the house
I was playing and ran into Burnout and I was thinking, “Oh finally I can upgrade my purple scar to a gold.” I spotted “The Dub” (the double barrel) and just started going berserk.
you forgot dragons beath no hate but just syig
Way too underrated
It’s not in the game anymore
This helps me a lot I was gonna record this
This video is outdated
That was funny when the car sinked
What about dreagon breath sniper?
"This mandolorian right here" lol, that do be me tho
6:43
I killed I guy who had the dub shotgun and I got the dub after
I went to find dummy but I couldn't find him i went to the same place as you
Anyone else watching this when there's 1 more
I actually got one of those exotics from mancake and that squads game i got it in was so fun(i am writing this comment right after that game and i got 4th place)
I have 10 000 gold but I don’t like to spend it
This is how baby yoda should look like in Fortnite because he’s in the bottom and not on the top 3:30
0:29 - oof sorry man
1:12 it is a magazine
A moment of silence,how much golds he used to buy
Yeesss
I killed ppl with big chill twice
The scoved pistol is very nice 😊
Thanks
Are they free after buying them
Do you have to buy them every time?
Nsu229qi1u10 thank you
I have
I'm going to try all of these in a game 1 by 1
the boom sniper is just the na-45 from cod mobile
Good
4 shots to the head
These items are too expensive for what they are
Just subscribed
So these are basically the equivalent of mythicals besides the mandalorian stuff
Okay jsyk, I bought the nighthawk cuz I was desperate and I actually got a few kills and eventually a win with it!
Chode’s sniper is definitely one of my favorites!
I just wanna know if you buy one of those guns can you keep going to the MPC and pick it up right away without buying the gun again?
I think I like the Dub more
Have like 15k or 20k gold and do all exotics in one game
You didn’t show mando
honestly the boom sniper is the best to me since alot of enemies dont really know this exists so when their hit for 10 or 25 they kinda let their guard down and continue the fight but then when they least expect it *B O O M*
postbox pat 😔
I got night owl from a kid à ma cakes location and I was about to buy one 🤣🤣🤣
hey 😊👋
Hi By Post, I noticed something about the Exotic rarity. It has the same amount of stars as the legendary rarity. When I found out about this new rarity, ( Thanks to this video ) I wondered where did it place in the scale?   So that also begs the question, how does Exotic and Legendary compare to each other if they have the same amount of stars?  Edit: Forgot the first "?" and fixed the 4th sentence by adding "also".
Good video
You forgot to mention the double barrel let’s you double pump without delay.
Question if you buy it once can you go back and get it again for free? Pls answet
Thank you postbox pat this will make it easier for me to find the exotic weapons
Rip pats gold
I have never felt so insulted by a video, it looks like it's made for litteral 5 year olds
Thank god I found this
hello i have found the night hawk on the ground i told my freind it was won of the rare guns then i found the boom sniper rifle when in a middle of a fight then died well i was lucky to find them
I hope that the Splode skin will return due to his NPC appearance
I got the dub from a player at stealthy strong hold
The second he started the intro my mind was like hi guys its post box pat here but the video hi guys by pat here
I noked a Porson whith the night hawk 288 meaters!!!!!!!!!!!
390th lol
Your cap and clickbait on one of you vids you said huntress was a boss she is not Cappy boi
The night hawk will soon be over power if I remember correctly it was c2s1 that gave us the winter fest blizzard and it made it to we’re we couldn’t see so if we can see in the storm and at night with thermal vision then the blizzard will have the same affect right?
Imagine copying Destiny
Kush Kush Kush 4000 + 299 + 2000 it makeup okay thousands life for dead video stop doing that 1000 Left 4 Dead videos and m400 the0101010010111111110101110101n  n
Do you have to buy it once, or do you have to buy it every match, like if you buy it, is it permanent? Like can you go to the shop person and get it for free next round?  Considering how expensive it is
The exotic double barrel shotgun's knockback reminds me of the knock back of the force a nature from TF2
Personnaly i think they not Worth it and specily for the Price they cauth!😒
Finally a YOUTUBER who actually shows the guns
So basically, somebody spent all their precious gold on night hawk, and killed them, instantly before the could use it..
How are you in a game with only 7 people?
The anime girl is form caramel dance OK am  a  weeb
the nighthawk is literally the scoped rev with thermal view for all my gold      oh hell naw
i aint played fortnite in ages and i jumped on randomly today, then i get attacked by fycking star wars and he has a jet pack
Some of the elim texts on the exotic weapons are glitched
7:05 Team Fortress 2 vibes anyone?
I think lexa is an anime girl or what
boom sniper rifle= worst

To summarize: Booms sniper rifle: D Tier, absolute trash, decent I guess in squads. Hits 10 to body, 20 to head, and also shoots a clinger to wherever you shot which deals 60 damage. Can’t one shot without shield, even with a headshot. Not worth it. Shadow Tracker: A Tier, Basically a silenced pistol, with a 16 clip and also marks the opponent if you tag them (little symbol above their head that shows you where they are) this lasts a very long time. Good DPS, and great for utility if you just want to get the upper hand in a battle. Night Hawk: B Tier Literally just a scoped revolver with thermal. Can be very good for sniping. Storm Scout: C+ Tier: literally just a storm scout sniper, zero difference. Good for escaping storm. If your good at sniping, you could be decent with it. The Dub: A+ Tier Very unique weapon, like a double barrel, but has a flint knock type affect that bounces you back. Body damage (max) is 120, and headshot is (max) 150. Wouldn’t go for head shots on this one, but very good for mobility and for gaining height in a battle. Damage wise is pretty decent too.
the color of the exotic is cyan
It makes me VERY uncomfortable seeing someone shoot a heavy sniper 2 times in a row without reloading
Pat I got the storm scout from someone and popped of!!!
Hmmm the boom sniper rifle is not bad not gonna lie
Glad I found this keep up the good work
Bro how have I never  seen your second channel before? Wth lmao
The ghost and shadow henchmen spawned for me I will send u it on Xbox my username is rowdyfun2006
Hey I use bypostpat I hope I get vbucks for battle pass so i can support u
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteous. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
How do you get so much gold?!
Thx
*R E E Z Z Z E*
Only the OG of this channel will remember his old username
The dub and pistel are so cool
How do you get so much gold before you land? Im so confused
I bought a exotic elweap9n and then my mum turned off the internet
All bosses fight each other
i hate that “90%” percent of you aren’t subscribed
Thank you
my savior
I came across someone that had the double barrel shotgun
yh the pistol is great i tried it earlier
It was a 1v1 and the other guy had the suppressed pistol and i laughed so hard
Exotic
Holy frick😱
Post can you recruit bosses and make them fight each other by making your friends recruit thembon an opposite team and make them fight or do henchmen vs mandolorian
Hopefully they add more exotic weapons as the season progresses 😁
“98.7% of you are not subscribed” he would have 60mil if everyone subscribed lmao. I dont think so😂
THEY Are mpcs
love your vids by post
Make all 49 NPCS in a arena battle
Reeses pistols my favorite
I love it
OMG I got you added and you had all npc on frist day
What happen to postboxpat???
God Bless ❤️
Here’s something interesting I found: The exotic weapon Lexa sells is literally the legendary Storm Scout Sniper from season 9&X with a different weapon texture. The other exotic I think is worth getting is the Shadow Tracker pistol Reese sells because it marks opponents.
The flint-knock pistol was my favourite weapon adn second was the double barrel!! I just lack gold...
I think the best is the storm sniper, cuz it takes 1 hit if you hit on the head
I’m a hacker I made my own exotic weapons in your car out of her exotic weapons will give you the ability to teleport anywhere you want and have 2 trillion bullets know to infinite bullets
How do exotics work? Do they hop games like gold? Thanks
Post could you do a recruiting all boss video to see if you can get loads of them or limit on your team
Can u gift me a skin my epic name is jasheemM
Do you need to buy the exotic weapons after you buy the the first time
(gets a no scope with the sniper) 10 damage "Visible frustration"
I subscribed
Fish Army raid
The only exotic I ever got was “the dub” it’s p cool because you can deal decent damage and get away from your enmities shotgun faster than they can pull it out
I have use 2 exotic the Dub and the night hawk
Your on Xbox I’m on a Xbox 1 s
Lest be honest  They're all garbage
boxer is midas clone
I got the storm scout sniper by killing someone. I also got the dub.
I have got the night hawk twice and won both of the games I had it
i use code alia
6:07 c a r
Sorta disappointing theres no new guns (exotics), theyre all either took from save the world or unvaulted
The boom sniper would be op in a build fight
I had got it the fire breathing dragon shotgun two times and one match a midnight in one matches I mean one match
Hey post! Just yesterday I found the Nighthawk off someone’s body and got a win with it, it’s not too good in game and I second your opinion of don’t buy it. But if you find it, it’s very fun
Not worth it
oop forgot to sub on my other account haha
Sorry i have a question does the gold waste in custom matchmaking and battle lab?
Post keep on working you are doing great I think you can reach your goal just keep charging at it
The pistol
last game, I just found the new purple shotgun..not sure about the name, but I found it from a henchmen chest near lazy and retail
Barbara876
Best YouTube in my opinion
This is helpful I found location of. Spoder,less,reese and all in this video
You should get all 40 mpc’s to fight
for the head
i would use the storm scout it has a 1 shot
6:10 машина под травой. Cars under grass
Привет
boom sniper rifle is the worst gun ever! its a rip off!🤮🤮🤮
Mucho texto
Hi
If u didnt know the silents pistol when u shoot somebody it will show u where they are i got it 2 times and got 2 easy victorys
Me
Wasn't aware the Exotic Boom Rifle was so low for damage. Looks to be more Utility/Support weapon for long range. Least you can take out buildings at a far distance easily. But for actually damaging players, eh....
I feel like an idiot but how do you go in a proper fortnite game with the storm and trainers without the other people like how you are in that game
I think that all the mythics and exotics should be in creative and when I say mythics I mean all the mythics ever like iron man's and the midas or brutus ones just every mythic even the light sabers
Can you do Mando vs Rukus boss battle.
There is more exotic weapon
Love the video Post! I'm kind of of doing a challenge of getting as much gold as I can and I'm currently sitting at around 4k gold so this is going to come in use for me!
;
They arent bosses they are traders , bosses either attack on site or have henchmen, traders are not bosses....play fallout or skyrim or borderlands or minecraft etc....you'll see what a trader is and they ain't a boss theres a huge difference pat big time
I wish they weren't so expensive
Those guns are from call of duty
what gamemodw are u on? If it's on playground, I dont think they have computer bots on playgeoumd?
Thanks for the 1 that I didn’t know of
Hi im new
Me and my friend where playing a duos and I killed a guy and he had the double barrel shotgun exotic
What i hate the most about season 15 is that stupid anime skin is freaking helerios that they added one :p
Something funny is if you elim a opponent with the DUB in the kill feed it says.  (: player 165) took a fat Dub on ( player 575)
