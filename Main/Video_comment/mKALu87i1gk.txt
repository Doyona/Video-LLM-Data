TEN hag is trying to fix the mess he inherated
Last season Liverpool game was a pivotal moment.
Time to get new manager
Got rashford playing well... hes been shite mark
“Building their own brand”… oh, the irony.  Stopped-in for 30 secs. Seems on par with bbc broom cupboard from back in the eighties.. sad that football (in Manchester) has come to this. Used to be football that people watched and engaged with. Good gig if u can get it… gossiping, whinging and driving speculation — incredible stuff 🤣🤣🤣🪂
The whole club is toxic
Facts
Rashford is a bang average player. Watch closely, plays well against lower tier teams, when it comes to pass and move he can't light a candle against the best. Flat track bully.
The problem with "Stories" is that they are only that, facts between a Club and its fans directly are never actualised, this is how the propaganda works.
He didn't sell the players that are not performing he just look at them if he hates his firing
A very foolish club. This is what happens when u still keep unwanted players. The club should have sold Maguire n co. Now Sancho has added up. The club should take out all these players
What position on the field of play do the Glazers play? Poor team and over rated manager.
Your leaks have all got a british passports
Notrophybridge
Manure United suck
Manchester United news sell and media wants numbers and will always send false information to sell papers and pay bribes to some staff and players to initiate these rubbish stories.
Why don’t we give ETH 4-5 yrs to rebuild like Liverpool and Arsenal have done for their managers? Look what they are doing presently. In ETH we believe because he is a winner and would never associate himself with failure. So who is pysocologically always playing for the downfall internally, in Manchester United???!!!
Great to see Ten Haag mudded
I swear Harry Maguire is thr snitch 😂😂
I see more attacking under OLE.
Slabberhead Esquire publications Inc.leaked ,so not traveling to wonderful Germany.
United will legitimately get to the point where no-one will want to manage them. Who'd want to put themselves in that spot where you know the moment things start to slip, the players can't wait to stab you in the back to protect themselves? It's genuinely pathetic
More locker room Leaks ! ⚽ 💧 💧 💧 💧 🙋🏻
4:54 rashford
Six and the GK defend while the four others float.
WTF is wrong with us supporters??? There is only ONE mission..... Glazers Out! You think a better Manager will come along after the omnishambles that the sale process and this season has been? You want ETH to get better results? Start getting games cancelled... force the investors who own stock to sue the Glazers for damaging the value of their investment
How can anyone want ETH out that would be crazy  it will take a few seasons before  we turn things around  and we need backing from owners the sooner the glazers leave the better for our club
Zidane new manager
How i wish Goldbridge Man Utd fans were supporting Mourinho this way who was even a better manager, during Mourinho time everyone was blaming Mourinho but he is the best Mgr since Alex left
I think Scott is the one who is leaking the news .. whenever he is under fire news breaks out from dressing room. We need to buy world class proven players..enuf of rashford Sancho etc. let’s accept we have to move away from our united way else we will be history. Never ever supporting rashford . He never plays for the fans he only plays for himself. Manchester rashford is his club not united.
Rashford could well leak against ETH if he puts Man U first and considers ETH to be complete bollocks at coaching & management.
"We've got the right manager.".  R u sure?
Murtough out
The reaction is ridiculous. I think United will easily stay up 😃
When your "best" player is Trashford.
Manager and players responsible for the results !!
Right. Something weird is going on at this club, someone wants this club to be drained dry and to keep playing shite.  Ten hag keeps playing crap players like eriksen instead of a good prospect like mainoo.   Ultimately ten hag says that sancho isn’t up to the standards in training which I find hilarious because the standards so far without sancho have been crap. He’s making the same managerial mistakes every game by playing a crap midfield.
Get ready for ten hag sacking boys of these players sack this guy we all need to kick off this isnt funny anymore these average players are the issue on the field
i thought Lingard was the leaker....🤔🤔🤔🤔
Mark your protection of rashford whos average at best is a joke 🤣 you need to wake up too funny you never once called rashford out from brighton yet the whole of tik tok amd social media are furious over the videos of watching the whole team be lazy allowing Brighton to pass us off the park
I think the team looks tired IMO. They have all played so many games since the world cup. Its insane. And we dont have depth to help.
This might as well be Sancho taking revenge. Not coincidence that this stuff started straight after he was kicked out of the team
Utd are in as Big a Mess As Everton
You carry Rashfords balls😂😂
ETH may be a good tactician BUT he obviously has lost the locker room. He needs to be removed. Makes me look at the Sancho situation in a different light
This is like the last 6 months of Ole, but with even worse football…
ETH = Dead-Man-Walking
Ronaldo practically anonymous again!
Matt Hargreaves Ex Sports Marketing Director at Adidas and former corporate lawyer after 4 months in the job as Manchester United Director of Football Negotiations is apparently going to be the answer to our prayers
Injuries? Everyone deals with injuries, generally without making excuses about it
Selling and forcing out useless players is more important than buying talent. It provides a sense of jeopardy to the rest of the squad ensuring they bring their A game.
Becoming a regular occurance, bloody embarassing. Stop blaming the Glazers!
Nobody respects that coach ! He never won anything and shouldn’t come into a dressing room disrespecting top players specially in public because he knows the players will answer back …and like a coward that’s what he wants to get the media and blind fans on his side !
Saying Man United had a great season last year because of Ten Hag is another ridiculous excuse ! People seem to forget that the reason MU finished in the top 4 was because Liverpool and Chelsea had a terrible season ! Viva Ronaldo !
Blaming the Glazers for all this is like blaming Ford for someone driving and getting into accidents while drunk ! Ridiculous ! The Glazers are not on the pitch and they don’t hire players ! They hire managers and coaches ! These are the ones responsible for getting the best or making sure players give their best ! Viva Ronaldo!
Supposedly Ten Hag ripped the players apart, all except his beloved Anthony Martial, who was probably given the day off
Goldbridge and me are the only sane fans left at this club, it's crazy.
Sell every one start fresh
It's never Ten Hags fault...
Rangnick benched rashford for a reason
Mark would divorce his wife if Fuhrer Hag asked him to 🤣🤣🤣 Time to get real and cure your bald fetish, the Dutch fraud is weak and makes stupid decisions.
A good discussion tonight with very valid points! Unfortunately we're going to be where we are for a  while yet! Changing the manager is not the answer!
Sancho is more likely to be a leak he has shown that he can not be trusted
Love Utd fans so deluded they think they're moving forward under Ten Hag
ETH’s tactic was cracked/unlocked/ripped/torn/twisted by the Brighton’s manager 2nd season in a row
ETH tactic was cracked/unlocked/ripped/torn/twisted by the Brighton’s manager 2nd season in a row
I reckon the leaks are happening within the recruitment department. Have heard a few things lately RE players that could point in that direction about players that have been brought in by Ten Hag, sounds like he doesn't trust them, has went over their heads on a few player signings and they're salty about it, looking for angles to discredit them and put it all on him and away from them.
It’s Gary Neville
With their bloated sals, who would leave wiz 2,3 or 4 yrs on their contracts ? Karma...
Rashie only mu player who runs a bit... Why blame only him.
Ten Hag should take responsibility for his midfield tactical changes which is causing inconsistencies in total performance of the team
Like ive always said utd are a classless club.
Coz they not only don’t have elite mentality like CR7, they also hate such people. While such elite mentality is the one that made ManU a successful club. So it’s obvious, that there is no saving this club for atleast few more years. Can keep hugging the past to survive the upcoming years. 💯
United Stand is my happy place.
So his first ‘good year’ was that about the Glazers as well? Don’t be naive Goldbridge…
I think its MAGUIRE
Ten Hag is facing a real test now. The knives are out for him. Ita ridiculous after 5 games but the noise is getting louder. Football in the social media age is ridiculous and a digital witch hunt.
Why is it rediculous too believe that Baldy Ten Hag is manipulating the transfers, look at all his signings.. Sit down please
Said it thousands of times.Rashford is not good enough . Get rid . But he sells loads of shirts etc which is all that the Glazers care about
Wouldn’t it be easier for you to start your own club so you can run it the way you want ..
Well Ten Hag has been very poor lately . His tactics have been short terrible and his lack of reactions during the game is concerning and Gary is right transfer should be handled by a proper sport director
how many more managers do we need to go through before we start going after the glazers  there needs to be protests.. mroe storming the pitch, and trying to shut down every match as much as possible and force the glazers out
United Need a Plumber Not a Manager at this point 😅
Does goldbridge still think the ball wasn't over line like the united staff
Nothing to see here 🤣🤣🤣🤣 shameless
However if I was Ten hag I would have been Disappointed with Martinez, Casemiro, Lindelof, Eriksen. Bruno also had a stinker. Scott Mctominay is a player that knows he's not wanted and his confidence is at rock bottom. Scott made his first start of the season and didn't play well either but the whole team had a bad game apart from Rashford
I thought it was originally Dean Henderson now I’m thinking it’s Mctominay or Sancho it has to be someone from before Ten Hag era and both them have reasons to point to it being them I don’t think it’s Maguire despite the argument going around he’s mistreated he genuinely seems to have love for the club
Get Sancho out Maguire out Rashford out McTominay out the football director out Glazers out the press manager out!! Fucking pussios will destroy this club!!
protecting ten hag again?
End of the road for ETH. The Cancer running the club will sack him before xmas unless we start winning, and winning consistently!
Sack him! He's useless
Saying a manager can use the club not being sold as an excuse is very silly.
For the love of god …. Name… the ….. PLAYERS
Lol. Try blaming Ronaldo now. Looks as though his apparent arrogance was not detrimental to the dressing room as it continues without him.  Ronaldo 7 goals this season>Man United 6
Bruno is no captain, he is meek , weak and he goes with the direction of the wind think of all our previous captains , Bruno is nowhere near such standards
The Glaziers are to blame for the current situation regarding our club..
Ten Hag should also have been letting us down , the formation, the stubbornness, lack of reaction when the team go down
Keep sticking up for bruno . He one of the main problem's lol. Brilliant haha
Unfortunately Ten Hag needs to use those returning from injury NOW! His in the firing line and "saving" these guys will cost him his job if he isn't getting wins. Atleast a win will prove he can't get things going but the Injuries are killing us
Bruno what !!!!!+? 😂😂😂😂😂 you must be kidding me
Man Utd are a disgrace of a club.
Rashford is the biggest brand at the club. An Athletic journalist wrote his book... 2 + 2
Grab your popcorn because United are at it again.
Garnacho and Pelistri gonna start looking elsewhere unless ten Haag starts trusting the younger players
Player power is king at old trafford.
the English players cliques VS the Foreign players is being played in the dressing room.
Who are these  players who are leaking from the dressing room????
Goldbridge bumming ten hag. ETH is a rubbish manager. The owners and ETH need to go and start United all over again.
Ten hag will change this around just watch
He's lost the dressing room .didn't get rid of the dead wood ..he won't recover
YANITED YANITED YANITED
With all my respect to Mark , but he is so deluded, when comes to Man Utd ! How can you back up a manager, who still have no idea what style he’s playing! Hope ETH stays at United for years ! 🙏😂😂😂
Ten Hag is lost. Lets be honest. He has too much favortism with out any reason (rashford bruno and anthony)
I'm super happy more problems at United Bruno Ret
Maguire is the leak and maybe lazy Sancho as well
Definitely not ETH fault after all he's not the one buying the players or training the players or picking the team oh wait he is ,get the popcorn ready it's going to get messy ❤😂.
CR7 WAS NOT THE PROBLEM!
Who is leaking these information, whoever,  they are against the club and fans.
Are you United fans becoming concerned with Ten Hag?
Mark you don’t have a team what you have is  a  bunch of good players and a coach don’t why to  play is  a team look at your captain
"ten Hag is using a certain agency to recruit player" are you kidding me? he is buying his previous players he did well in Dutch league and actually have the Audacity to think those players are good enough for the premier league,,, theres ur problem, this manager wont last Christmas he is a fraud
Love this lol
If you think we had a great season last season, then I do not know what to call you.
Ten hags junk mate.
the glazers are so unapreciated , 7hag and his stuff need to get fired immediately . otherwise man utd might follow leeds and leicester
🍿🍿🍿🍿
Its clealry Ronaldo's fault.
Maguire should start again His fail compilations are good ad revenue for ManU
The glazers claim they can't spend more because of ffp so what difference would the Qatar owners of made if that's the case
I thought the fans claimed it was Pogba 😅
Please let Maguire start again 😂
Goldbridge names all the transfer listed players that didn't go.....Use your brain and see who's agents are trying to undermine ETH 🙈🤣👍🏼
Sack the players rather lose with youngsters.
Circus FC😂
Funny how easy Mark forgets how United treated David Moyes but yet ETH has been treated so badly!!! Load of BS
Perhaps Tottenham , Arsenal and Brighton are playing better football and will finish above us along with City and Liverpool is certainly looks that way to me 🤔 who's fault is it well everyone involved really but not the fans from Manchester who attend the games in support of their teams that's for sure ....it falls upon the Manager to fix things he can fix and I believe he can be his own worst enemy in managing certain individual players but let's see if he can build bridges and get the season moving 😁
they treated ole differently
The glazers are not responsible fo wat happens on the pitch dats Ten hag
see what goldbridge and berg say after 12 games things are not going to get better smell the coffee,,,,,,,
Ten hag needs to go. Dreadful football ..
Bring back the hair dryer treatment from fergie
'Here we go again' 🎶🎶
The Sun is just a tabloid for gossiping
"RONALDO IS TOXIC IN THE DRESSING ROOM" haaaaaa
It amazes me how people can blame Ten Hag and want to sack him and for who?  This has and will happen with every single manager with this ownership. The fact that we still have a player that never  was or will never be captain or a star player from the Van Gaal era says everything about our club.
Time to admit it to yourself: you are in an abusive relationship with a football club. YOU are the victim. Walk away - come back if the abuser leaves or dies.  In the meantime divert all that misery time into a new hobby or something you already love. After 55 years supporting the club, I walked away from United last week , should have done it 15 years ago. I already feel re-energised.
Jose mohrinio didn't get any chance to do his job..Ten hag can't compare or compete with Jose mohrinio
Can’t wait for tomorrow’s humiliation 🎉🎉🎉🎉 deserved ❤
Ten hag is not a good coach for Manchester United..stop backing him and his bs..he doesn't have any tactics don't you see
Sack him...
So you rake City over spending, yet what you want to see from United is more spending... 🧐
Get rid of HM and JS!
You are a toxic element for my club.  Your entire existence revolves around creating drama and kicking up trouble with everything that you say.   Get out of your egos way.     T)
Its the managers fault though! You can't blame the owners and backroom staff who have gotten the wrong manager for the last decade and can't get rid of players who are clear distractions
Can we get rid of HM?
Bro you spent 40 minutes Defending ten hag, and you also do the same “I like ten hag but” everybody does it “mafia”
This just further proves that Manchester United lives rent free in everyones heads. It's brilliant. More articles about our first 5 games than there was of City winning a treble 🤏🤓
When you have a below average…incompetent…recruitment and club management team, I’m not surprised the manager would want to be more involved in transfers.  The manager will almost always be blamed if there results are not there regardless of the performance of the manager and transfers.
Just get over it kids, u will never be as good as u were under saf, time to face the facts.
Why do u keep saying he had a brilliant season “ten hag”.  Barely finished third on the last day in a terrible season.  Standards have fallen massively. You lost 7 nil to Liverpool last year . Brilliant season Mark🫡
Mark is right, content creators say the biggest bullshit of all time. Eg haber, kirbz, capguntom etc…
Obviously it’s McGuire just put him on a ship to Zimbabwe please
Arry needs to step in for sure , this is where he is at his best , in arrys own words “ I am the punchbag that takes the flak for my teams that’s why they pay me 250k per week “ 👍
Gary neville should keep his mouth shut, what does he know about management.
How you guys can’t see he’s not an elite manager blows my mind. Under him you’ve never looked elite and don’t look like you’re improving at all. As a neutral I hope he stays, it’s hilarious.
It’s a shame that so many MAN U fans and other teams supporters blame the owners for… everything that’s wrong with our/a club.  With MU buy stocks and vote others in.           T)
Horrible injuries of Antony and Sancho hold Man Utd back.
Club is in shitte from manager down to ball boy
it seems our club from top to bottom uses our manager as the scapegoat
Again Ten Hag went public first on Sancho 😂 your logic is hypocritical
Surprise surprise, the moment we say anything against English players leaks start coming. Just sent these to the U21 bench.
Bro thinks hes pep
You were never meant to get two strikers
Totally agree. We shouldnt change managers until there are new owners and new board + a couple of years for the changes to take place. Certain players need to go, dont care who they are. Ill support ETH over any of them because Ive seen them not care about the team/club on the pitch
It looks like the players have been told to ignore our number 9 which is obviously not the case but that’s how they play, it happened with Ronaldo too, most of Ronaldos goals were moments of individual brilliance! Our wingers are greedy. Hoijland is in a graveyard shift. Greedy owners attract greedy players!
Good show 👍, I am Ten Hag all in, changing managers wont solve our on field problems, Glazers is the main culprit..... However sense some protectionism for Rashford on "THE UNITED STAND", He doesn't do anyone a favor up front...... I feel sorry for hojlund but I have a feeling he not going to allow RASHFORD to hold him down.
That agency has seen us grossly overpay for ins and undervalue outs
Man things aren’t good
Love it when mark is brutal🧏🏾‍♂️
But Ronaldo was the problem right? Lol😂
Drain the swamp!
Mark is going full blown conspiracy in this one lol
Mark is the biggest leak of all
ETH doesn’t do himself any favours when he persists with Rashford wasting chances, being selfish and never ever being subbed or dropped. Same applies to Bruno. When he arrived what gave him credibility was that no one was safe, it was about maximum effort and talent. It breeds genuine confidence that if you try hard enough you will get an opportunity. When the fans begin to get frustrated when they can clearly see - Rashford is an issue! Pellistri isn’t getting a fair chance and why do we shoe horn Bruno everywhere. He would have greater support in what are clearly tough circumstances if he stops being stubborn. Granted politics at United cannot be easy as I imagine part of the agreement on the project was making sure it centred around Rashford and Bruno - Marketing. But no manager can manage with players who are not good enough being forced on them.
It’s rotten to the core
It’s not the coach it’s the club and players. Same ol players same ol problems
ETH overpaid Antony and Malacia and Martinez was clearly him doing his old club a solid
Can't understand why man utd went a second time with a Dutch manager  .
Ten hag should let them go
Ten hag using his agent to help recruit because our scouting is terrible and thats a problem somwhow ffs what do you expect him to do?
Great season 🤣
I know who the big leak is??? Old trafford roof 🤣🤣🤣
If man united sack ten hag i swear i will question myself  “am i supporting the right club”
All these things going on at united is ridiculous we are a circus I never hear about this kind of stuff from any other club injuries aside it's just a joke can't believe we have to defend ten hag this early in his career all this kind of drama just makes you loose faith in people it's sad
As Graeme souness said last season we were getting away it  ETH maynot get the players he wants but he does set the priorities his were  Mason mount  And  Ounana Wrong  Forward first then center half
Mark you're a big leak too!
banana united strikes again. The greatest of English football?
Its abit rich to say manutd are targetted by media but last season you had a LIVERPOOL IN CRISIS video everytime they lost lol
Rashford is a huge part of the problem, said it for years, he is not good enough and very lazy
Spot on the mainstream ! Great show mate, GMMU. they will be back one of these years.
Ten Hag needs to go to save our club.
as a supporter since 2001. this club is fucked beyond belief. i dont see a way out. the culture is shocking, full of primadonnas and the glazers are top of the iceberg
Yap…. It’s all Glazers fault. Nothing to do with the world class players and coach. Harry Maguire is the best in the world and so is Jonny Evans. Let’s blame the Glazers😅😂😂😂😂 Froms Rags to relegation 😅😅
I think your comments about the mainstream spread wider than football. They use these tactics to manipulate opinion on a wide range of topics
Manager is trash
You made a statement there Mark that maybe we don't have the coaches well Ten Hagg employed them WTF
sick of this blaming glazers have backed every manager
"Open heart surgery" exactly what Manchester united need and until such is done there will be no positive progress
I really think rashford and maguire is toxic at this club, they have a huge influence in the dressing room.  Rotten club going nowhere
People laude Klopp, Pep and Arteta, but they are so quickly to forget their first season wasn't that great. TEN HAGS SEASON WAS GOOD. I'm not saying he automatically is going to be a Pep or Klopp or Arteta but if you think he doesn't promote good football go watch another sport.   Support your manager through this season and next one and you will see results. For the first time since Fergie, I see good football played around whether we win or not. Support your manager!
Use the toilet before watching first few minutes.  I had to run to take a leak.
Totally agree! Its a mafia thing for sure.
Sancho and his agent are the leaks
Totally spot on Easiest way is to shift blame to mgr! This would never happen under pep or fergie
Rasford and Bruno were on strike last season and we rewarded them. Club is rotten total clear out.
ETH leads smear campaign vs Player, but negativity on him is the disgrace?
GLAZER'S AND MAGUIRE OUT
United above Chelsea and just below Newcastle. Not a bad start to this season
I'd be pissed off if the players didn't have a "fall out" after the game against Brighton, BUT, show that passion on the field instead of waiting until the game has finished.
B b b but they play expansive football 🥺 onana ball playing goalie why aren’t we first in the league 🥺🥺
We need a new owner until that day it’s a roundabout
So ten hag can't be criticized..... flat face goldbridge never stops shilling
Deja Vu.... After 14 months.. the leaks are back! How Mind boggling STUPID!
Sorry for the typo. I mean : "There is NO Passion anymore....:
The trouble is Rashford wouldn't trust the man
Is mark describing himself as a content provider? 😂😂😂😂
"That's not good" (0:57). I disagree. It's hilarious.
Remember...businesses which are being sold are in chaos.  Who are the 'staff' who are leaking? Simple. It's the crack recruitment team. They now have a built in excuse for when it goes bad. 'Well, we couldn't do our job because Ten Hag had his agency handle transfers. Wasn't us...'
Ten Hag has no personality and his team demonstrate this exactly.
Was Ronaldo wrong in what he said in the interview with piers morgan 🤔
How does Mark know any of this. It’s probably him spinning the stories
Erick just doesn’t give a good spirit for me - not saying his the wrong manager tho. Our players clearly can’t follow his orders …
To be honest  Erik tactic need calling out all they do is try to play the ball over the top for rashford
MU is better at creating drama than scoring goals
Get rid of all. Owners, players, medical staff, stadium, training, and managing staff. Then start a new
All the English Bias and Poison starts to get the darts and knives sharpened to injure ETH. They are a disgraceful bunch. The X players and English Journalists are a CLAN. Glaziers and Stagnant Deadwood have to go for MU to advance.
Leaks again? Just get rid of these lazy overpaid TikTok celebrities…
Mark = Classic example of the main street media. Inventing controversial agenda's 'Headlines' to get hits!!! The video content is hardly ever relevant to the title/headline.
More leaks than a bloody cactus holding a water balloon
It’s beyond embarrassing
Glazers can’t afford to sack Ten Haag even if they wanted to they couldn’t afford to…
Funny when Rasford struggles or doesnt get his way leaks start to happen
Mess we are
The glazers are not managing the team, Or playing the game. The players are the problem.
Our legend are part of our problem
It doesn't help when ten hag does not admit his team is not doing well. While this takes pressure off the team, at the same time players think it is ok to play like this.
Some of This players at Manchester are Evil 👿
Always blaming everyone and anything when United is not doing well. Ten Hag had good teachers because that is also what he does everytime. Nobody takes any responsiblity
Can the players and agents not be required to sign a non disclosure  agreement prior to signing for Manchester United and if they break  the rules they should be have litigation  brought against  them
Klopp style - gegenpressing Ten hag style - depressing
The big factor is seven hav and his lack of tactics, the team doesn't seem to know what they are doing
We've been here before. You have to ask a) Are these leaks real.? b) who has the most to gain from these leaks? and c) what are the useless clowns in the board doing about it?
You all know now what's the problem???  You all understand cr7 & degea not the problem  This club is now ridiculous
Chaos FC
Still would rather ten hags agency… we basically bought from the bargain bin beforehand.
what a load of bull
Good on you goldbridge. Call out the tw*ts running united
Hohoho loving this, they must hate you Mark, keep it up.
Amazing how numerous DIFFERENT managers are all to blame. Not the SAME players in each of their teams.
One of the best shows lately, Mark.
You have a squad of average players signed by multiple managers. You shouldn't have Onana or Mount in your squad. Antony is not United-level and so on and so on
GLAZERS GESTAPO MUST GO!!!!!!
Whoever is leaking this needs to be removed from all our squads and let them rot until their contract ends.
We’re 4 places above relegation that says it all ffs we’re a joke
Oooooh the Dejavu on this one!
I don't know why we keep on making excuses. Ten Hag made poor decisions on the the game against Brighton it was like we where playing away and on top off that we had to Many Middlefields in the game. After that we where losing and he made the biggest mistake by taking off Hojlund ,he was suppose to keep him in and add another striker plus a winger and attack. But Ten Hag is lucky to have people like you who will need excuses to not blame the coach we need to also blame the players and coach, as we blame the owners .
Zidane wouldn't even take the job before ETH was approached
So we dont blame the Glaziers for the type of players coming in then!!!!!!
Something I don’t hear talked about much is the lack of a leader on the field. I like Bruno, but he isn’t a leader. Until they have a galvanizing force as a player, and we all know what that looks and smells like, that absence will continue to impact us. Not saying that’s THE answer, but I rarely hear it talked about.
There had better of been unrest in the dressing room after the Brighton shambles i would be more worried if there wasn't unrest in the dressing room.
Lather, rinse, repeat.
Maguire up to his old tricks 🤔
Nothing more than a circus 🤡🤡🤡 run by clowns for the amusement of opposition fans.
Maguire is the "Mole"
Remove the english brats from the team and everything will be fine
The beginning of E10hug's era
Losing has nothing to do with the Glazers.... Other coaches with fewer resources have stamped their mark on their teams.
Got the same core group of players, idc if they start or not they are part of the squad and spreading toxicity as usual. Bruno  Rashford Shaw mctomminay Maguire and others have been part of this culture for years
Mark.. Simple question. Why Barcelona would risk it and start 16 years old player? Ten hag should teach senior players a lesson. Xavi did.
Get ready for 6/7 goals thrashing from Bayern
Remember the guy that stormed off? He was made the team was playing bad where did that guy go? I don't see him anymore.
"The Deluded Stand"
It’s exactly the way it went with the last three managers - Glazers out out out🤬
The theatre of deludes.
I dont care if we get relegated, as long as these players dont get their way. this cycle needs to stop once and for all
Most likely sancho after what’s happened
Ten Hag's time is coming to an end. Man said eras do come to end when asked about Pep and Klopp but his own era ended before even starting 😂😭😭
Did Manchester United really do well last season or were other top clubs simply underperforming?
Leaks FC😢
Goldbridge, Ten Hag is the problem. You are one of my hero but this time you are completely wrong. Ten Hag has destroyed manutd, buying scrap firmer Ajax player. Turning manutd to scrap Ajax
You always say you have lots to talk about and you usually talk about nothing
Mark has been on fire lately. I very often find myself disagreeing with him but the last few days I agree with everything. Top work from the lad!
Murtough and Arnold...if you listen or watch this community, heed my words; allow Ten Hag to do what is best for the club. The total waste of times characters who are within this squad need to go. Murtough and Arnold, do your job. Make funds available....get deals requested by Ten Hag done...and stay out of football related matters. Murtough and Arnold.....your time also will come...believe me on that one
It's shocking to read of the British media having a go at ten Hag and it's even more shocking that many are buying into the narrative that he is the problem. Sure, it's not a good start but we're only into the fifth game of the season with injuries to many of our players and the fact that we're still stuck with players that we're not capable of selling. Our recruitment team is hopeless and I've just read that they don’t think Sofyan Amrabat will succeed in England. Why are they making comments like this? Get ten Hag the players he wanted and give him time. Mark, I agree with your assessment on what Gary Neville said as he seemed to be talking in circles.
Ten Hag did a decent job last season but don’t forget a few teams had horrible seasons that normally don’t which opened the door for Man U to get 3rd
Ronaldo is the problem 😂 doesnt track back blah blah, 😂 doesn't fot ten hags system blah blah 😭 UTD play better without Ronaldo!!! 😂 idiots...the players have been scapegoats ..the issue is Ten Hag is crap
I feel sorry for Sir Alex he built that club back up from a mid table club to the best in the world at one point
You have passion or sympathy for Ten Hag. That is not the way you handle Mourhino, Ole, Van gaal, and MOSES.
De Zerbi clearly better than EtH
The English players.  Need to get rid of players from the previous regime, all of them
Sancho probs the one who leaked it
Anyone with a British Passport has a free pass. Anyone ethnic is targeted
Ten hag is the leak.. he had no issue leaking how players perform in training soooo 🤷🏿‍♂️
This is maguire how can nobody see it?
We are about -4 points where we should be with the fixtures we had
Why do you guys constantly blame things on the glazers. So you claim your current position is about injuries, transfers and the GLAZERS????  Yet you look back at the year with Ten Hag and say its been ok and you finished 3rd, yet that was also with the Glazers.  When things go wrong Glazers, Glazers Glazers, when things go right no mention of them.🫣
Eriks at the wheeeeeeeeeeeel 🚌🚌🤡🤡🤡🤡
Ten Hag is the problem. How can you train a team to reverse the ball to their defence all the time. Weak attacking ability with players not supporting attack. Slow, weak, and lack motivation. Lack winning spirit
Sack bruno
EtH had same pore record away from home last season
I can understand why Jamie Carragher goes in on the manager because he played for a rival team, but I don’t get Neville having a crack at the manager if they’ve got nothing to say you if they’ve got nothing intelligent to say they should keep them I’ll shut
Shaw, Maguire, Rashford, McTominay, Martial, Sancho to name a few. Don’t trust any of them. Throwing another manager under the bus.
Leaker? Easy, Maguire, Sancho.
It was fun while it lasted 😢
😂 like clockwork, United players throwing the manager under the bus. Let the countdown to a Christmas sacking begin
United making it easy for opposition by being so predictable in attack united try to score through a packed defence and don't get a shot on target
Ten Hag is the problem. How can you have a defensive problem and go ahead and buy forward
Toxic atmosphere
That club stinks.
I watched the Utd under 18s last Saturday and they had player sent off and they put up more fight with 10men than the 1st team and actually won
Wow our club is in a royal mess.
are you lot on the take??? get rid of this duck!
I think im gonna stop following United. As long as management and the glazers doesnt change, United will continue to struggle. T ETH is not really getting what he needs to build a proper team. Im afraid United will continue to struggle in the sub-top
The training style and playing tactics are too old. Players are lazy and slow on the ball because of poor traing
The SUN reported leaks, those reports were already denied yesterday BEFORE this video.
Bayern game will be the real test 👍🏽
It's the Mummy's boys: Rashford and Maguire. Maybe add MacTominay.
Ronaldo called all of this🤣🤣🤣🤣
If you’ve not got the balls to out the players, stop talking about it.  You’re part of the issue!
We will never know that Ten Hag has destroyed manutd until we begin to fight relegation. Buying scrap players inflating their price and salary.
Mark you are so wright we need to support our manager these owners need to go glazers out and Arnold and Murtough
You could appoint Mother Theresa, Einstein and Superman as managers at ManU, it would have the exact same effect.
How many managers hve been mucked about by certain players
We suppose to be beating Bayern Munic in the ECL during the week not causing drama.
Eth first year was lucky
United in crisis?
My opinion..........It's Harry Maguire.......... the one who thinks he is better than everybody else 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Ten hag is the problem. He is gradually converting manutd to old style Ajax. Buying players thar are not first choice in their team. Buying them just because he played them at Ajax
Chaos is the best strength for the Glazers
It this continues, someone will be needed to take the blame. Glazers won't be the one. It's either Ten Hag or the players. Last season it was Ronaldo
Last season was great if you forget the hammerings, the lack of quality, the bagfull of HOME cup ties against nobodies and that a win nearly always meant a moment amid the dross.  That's what we're "backing".
Support ETH, media just trying to sell fake stories using United
Ten fraud
Just gets better
We need to make sure Shea Lacey is looked after at this club which is falling apart.
Paid so much but have no desire to play for the club
Marcus Rashford is still being selfish on the ball as aways thinking he's Ronaldo that's what he's trying to do what Ronaldo aways did with united and it doesn't work for Rashford and he knows that at least Rasmus hoijlund runs with the ball and passes the ball Rashford needs to watch what Rasmus does  I'm looking forward to seen amrambat's debut  👍 soon can't believe that he has an injury already Rasmus had that same problem
If the head of the body does not work, then why would you think the rest of the body will
Ten Hag relied on Rashford overperforming last season.   You can't blame Ten Hag underachieving on Rashford performing at his level now.
We need to trust ETH, it’s the process, all success come with down times. Back ETH United fans, we always wanted him and we get him now we need to back him.
English players achieve nothing but their attitude is of a Only fans Model
Bruno is shite.
british player are so lazy so they love more talking  than playing football.....i wish man utd has no english player .....
Well said.
Manchester United are their own worst enemy.
Well done to our chief negotiator on getting Chelsea to part with Mason Mount for 60 million with one year left on his deal. It shows just how good he is at his job that he has to put a press statement out to encourage mindless fans to think that the future is bright.
If these players being clear out this summer then ten hag can start clean but unfortunately for him few players club can't move out
Glazers have held this club and fans in a chokehold for the past 17 years
Can you believe it that ETH pisses off the squad and suddenly things start being leaked. Wait .. yes I can. Baldie is incompetent. Not had a good performance in about 9 months. We just got lucky wins off the back of Rashford having a wild run of form otherwise ETH would have had us in 6th last year.   This year we will be fighting for 6th.
Bruno is part of the problem, he gets all over the ground and leaves gaps.
I like Ten hag he does make bad Descions on who to bring off and off I didn't like the way he took of Rasmus  hoijlund and kept Rashford on bad discsion Rushford should've came off there at the weekend ten hag really needs to work out this problem out quickly
To me it seems like the papers have information on a player and get leaks through them. The media did it with tiger woods they knew about his affairs for years but he would do pics and interviews to keep the story coming out. Mainstream media is dicusting.
Managers use there agents all the time, we used to be disappointed that we didn't use Mendes more with Jose
am  standing with Erik tenhag all the way despite all the nonsense coming out of the so called biased pundits like carrager and souness even our former Garry
Snitches deserves stitches
I’ve come to realize mark is genuinely deluded. Ten hag needs to have every single first choice player in order to start winning games and playing good football? That is such dross. No manager gets their first choice in every position. Such whining.
MUFC players are mediocre unprofessional with overinflated opinions of themselves
United second season syndrome is leaks 😂😂
DEJA VU  TOXIC FC
He is implying it's Harry Maquire and his team including that mum of his
I've latched on to the fact that we haven't had many leaks that maybe the problems are overblown. I'm getting less and less certain of that.
Well know who these leaks come from.  All the English players.  All the rest are new.
Mark missed the mark when the comment came up about Sancho's comments about Antony and the formation change. It's the fact that we've been asking to see Pellistri play and get minutes on the right who can run and put crosses in better than Antony but it seems like the position is Bruno or Antony.. even putting rashford on the right and Garancho on the left and sub pellestri for Garancho and move rashford left. Was a better solution than that diamond crap with mctoninay
Have you considered that Ten Hag really wants the Glazers to stay because it offers the perfect excuse/defence for him.   Rather than the personal accountability that would come with a different owner.
You support and represent the most hated club in world football. The entitlement you demonstrate is simply laughable. They are a bad organisation from top to bottom, the product reflects that fact.
Leakers need to be found and booted out
Overated english players in maguire and co
Bruno 😂 I assume it’s Bruno.  All jokes aside it could be Jadon 🤷🏽🎊
Successful: third place, having NO CHANCE AT ALL of any fight for the title. One Curabao Cup title. 😅😂😂  Resume: secure a champions league spot, so we could get destroyed there... And, with some hope, a little cup title... THAT'S SUCCESSFUL!!!!
Shaw & Maguire
Honestly this club and some of us players are such a joke now. Sad to see
mark everyone should be called out if eth is playing antony evry singlr game even after performing poorly evryone should get a chance, the way he is favouring the likes of rashford and antony , needs to be called out not throw players under before even telling them the reason
Utd are  like coronation st......hilarious
Amrabat hasn’t even played yet and he’s getting slagged off, grow up muppets.
LMAO this club is more pathetic than the host of this show
Send to rotten eggs to train with Sancho, the sulking prat… and give youth a chance !
If u think Bruno do pressing, you're blind
Most toxic club
FOOTBALL AGENTS ?  jaydon sancho 87 million  Anthony 85 million  172 MILLIONS WORTH OF TALENT NOT EVEN IN THE SIDE
Oh United ..... the gift that can not stop giving !!!!!!!
Wtf 🤬 , anyone who has played a team game has argued and pointed fingers  ( and more ) after losing , it’s then decided on how to fix the problems ….
This coach gave zidan iqbal not one minute after an impressive pre season, hardly played pellestri after a promising world cup but consistently plays inconsistent players that cant be bothered yet we are supposed to praise him as the coming of the messiah sorry mark but ten haag is a fraud
Blaming the injuries 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 funniest thing I have heard today
Shaw, maguire, rashford, scot. Leopards don’t change their spots. Wondering where all these licks are coming from.
Any good news ?
How do u go from playing on a weekend which is once a week adding one game midweek turns into three games a week ? mark’s math ain’t mathing
So long as the Glazers remain owners of Manchester United they will never win anything major. Pep and Klopp could never win the League with the Glazers as owners. Everything from recruitment to selling of players, to the stadium to the training facilities is terrible. And that hasn't changed in over a decade. Changing managers and players will change nothing. Anyone who turns on the manager and even the players at this rate are pro Glazers. No matter the results we must always say Glazers out. Otherwise nothing changes
This is just hilarious
I like eric and think hes a  decent manager , however you cant call out players when they play badly and not call the manager out when he makes mistakes,  also it really doesn't  matter who leaks what & when  ALL THAT MATTERS IS WINNING FOOTBALL  MATCHES
So you get leaks as well 👀… who in the dressing room(player/staff) is leaking this to you?
Glazer protecting the players cause that their asset and willing to sack managers
Bang on we need to get rid of these rotten apples the players that don’t wanna go and the owners that don’t want to go
TH is probably sick of the board and wants out. So he will purposely choose players that are not good to prove a point and to get the sack
Glaziers apparently have put a handbrake on Manchester United. Yet they spent £178 million on four new arrivals. No the owners at fault. Need a manager prepared to give up control of transfers and get a director of football in.
United down fall. I'll be there no matter what
Mark and his usual bs haha. If only he said about all this since mourinho.
bumba
TERMINAL
Why doesnt anybody mention the fact rashford has been terrible, selfish and is not getting the goals he did last year to counter that arguement. That and wout weghorst are the two missing factors from last year at least the lad closed down the opposition defence
Make you wondet what they are doing at Carrington all week, because its certainly not working on tactics. Time to close the doors on this joke shop.
Maybe Ten Hag's tactics are quite easy to work out.   And now every manager's had two looks at him and have had a full summer to counteract it. While he's not really changed or developed.
Backstabbers United, Erik Ten Hag is going to be included the list of Jose, Ole, Van Gaal
Trust me ETH wont be here next season i said it weeks ago and i was first to call that out. The Glazer's cirkus continue
Always enjoy Excusebridge!!
You can feel an absolute hammering coming against bayern 😪 When it rains it pours man
Ten Hag my manager! Sack him and it will get worse!
Not only players, the higher authority is also playing a role in these leaks because they dont want to be blamed and post a good image in every fans mind...fans need to be clever and also the experts and legends.......This is very good policy in politics but not in a football team.
Sack Maguire, Rashford, Mctominey, Sancho
ManchesterUnited should bring in a policy, where a player or staff leak info out on the club or manager should have their contract terminated or have three months wages deducted.
I am very happy that cr7 left  if he was here he should be blamed
just pack ya bags and leave this teams a joke !!!!😅
i want to hear about fallouts after that shambles on Saturday they should being having a go at each other
Surely by nx season most of these snake players will be running out of contract & will have to leave this club
United have spent €440 million since ETH took over. How can you be talking about a lack of spending with a straight face? Laugha le.
As a youth try hard not to be a slave to drugs. Creative and very educating.
Team doing well - "it's the manager" Team doing badly - "it's the players"   Yeah, don't work like that, I'm afraid. Ten Hag takes even less accountability & plays media games (see treatment of Sancho) even moreso.
Excuse-bridge 😂. Ten Hag has not been good enough. No-one is bigger than the club..
Manchester Divided back at it bunch of prats
Ten Hag ultimately has one more season to prove himself and sort his dressing room out. Not easy when the people above are useless, but he needs to stamp down his authority or these player will crap all over him. They have a track record with the previous managers.  Artea took charge by terminating Aubameyangs contract, half the United squad needs their contracts terminating so Ten Hag can inbed what he wants to acheive
You need to back ETH not because he's the right man (he's not lol), but because sacking another manager would only create more problems and won't solve anything.
Enough is enough, suspend these spoilt, underperforming, under whelming,  snowflakes, they are an embarrassment to United.
Poor Mark is  desperately trying to put out all the fires regarding Man United.  😅😅
Rashford leaking again
I think the transfers related to Ten Hag are all because of ManU's failing recruiment. If they would've actually bought and scouted some proper players, then Ten Hag wouldn't have to insist on people he knows. But, even more so, he probably doesn't even trust this shameful scouting anyways.
It's becoming clear the players don't fear ten hag , these stories must be true , ten hag is to busy putting out fires he can't see the big picture
That's why you dont keep players the manager obviously don't want around, like Maguire,  sancho, scott et al.
The player who leaks if found should be prosecuted for breach of contract and  made an example of for the whole of premiership over paid and over rated traitors
Fucking hell the cycle continues
A completely broken football club thar a) never recovered from fergie retiring and b) couldn't recover because of the parasite owners
If ten is manager of Brighton.... Brighton will be loss...ten out j.morino in
Ten Hag takes less accountability than the players.   He's literally encouraging the players now to take even less accountability than they did already.
I love it long may it continue
If players start to fight each other that is not good. The Manager should avoid those types of fallouts because it will further decrease the togetherness and soon we will have more scapegoats than wins, players will divide according to their interest. The Manager has the authority of keeping players together. Ole was successful in that.
Well your defence leaks, the roof at OT leaks, it’s hardly a surprise
Stop blaming transfers the problem is the coaching we playing coward football so we going to lose a lot of games. When Eth came in he said he would play attacking football but it's the opposite
Sancho leaked his feelings, players not wanted still here all the old guard still here, more leeks, bad attitude no supprise. Bad apples to effect other players, has they don't try so don't see the point crept into the team.
You’re just delaying the inevitable
Liverpool was in the same situation last year .. But Klopp is a real leader and keep the team working together.. No finger pointing, back stabbing, axe throwing, towel dropping or jumping to conclusions - all of which seems to be the best sport exercise practiced by United players.,
We need new owners asap who will get rid of player power...get rid of these players and board...and create a positive team...
Mr Goldbrigde is either new to football or he's being delusional because agents have been giving managers kickbacks forever only now their better at tracing the cash to offshore accounts so its only a matter of time before Ben Ten Hag will be running for the hills 😂
Didn't all the other managers have a good first season and then fall off during the second season
I said this to you over a year ago with Ronaldo. I told you about the snowball effect. I said karma was around the corner. This is all spin from the Glazers.
we're screwed lol
Last year rashford was best thing since slice bread now all of a sudden he shoots to much and is lazy. You man United fans switch quicker than a light switch. If you take him out the team you will struggle to finish top 8 .
Rashfraud at it again?! 😂😂😂
So who they blaming now for the Leaks? Bailly has gone can't be him - Sancho wasn't in the squad - Martial on a strop after losing his place?
It's all over ten hag.
Its been a while since I got hooked into to a soap, but this one has such great twists.
thang is not perfect he has mistakes , big mistakes but we turn to players why are this young guys are not given a chance , we are predicterble
If ten hag is forced out the cycle will keep going on until changes happen at the very top. Ten Hag isn’t perfect but if they’re not gonna back the manger who are they going to back?
Unfortunately fans find it difficult to give the manager enough time to assemble the team they want results yesterday which is impossible
Our signings are the worst considering what we pay for players
I find it astonishing some fans calling for his sacking. Hes only just started his second season. Im guessing most of them are the younger generation who because of technology require instant gratification. They think new manager so expect the league and CL witin two seasons.   It took Fergie four years not just to win his first trophy but to change the entire team apart from Robson and Hughes. In his second season he finished mid table. Tommy D did exactly the same and was even more ruthless.  This club is a mess and will be until we see the final stitches after the open heart surgery. That could take a number of years. We have to be patient and gut out the pain. Don't put the manager under pressure. Yes question tactics and decisions, that's part of football but c'mon, give him more than one and a bit seasons.
that Maguire should've go whether in loan or at any cost + undisciplined sancho i guess the leaks and negativity comes from those two obviously specially the former captain in Maguire
Who else but the British players…those baatards are the one who have access to media
Mark was wrong about Jose, wrong about Ole. But he’s right about ETH? Lool
Spot on Mark Goldbridge
Sir Alex said to stand by him all the way and any of you that support Man U and have a problem with ten hag you’re delusional to think he’s going to take us at the top straight away you need to trust his process
Very important video for Man Utd fans. We need to back ten hag and crank up the pressure on the glazers.  Ten hag has more respect and admiration for utds legacy than the glazers ever will.
Goldbridge finding as many excuses as possible for our crap football. For on pitch humiliations, of which there’s been MANY both last season and this season…All fingers point to the manager!
The more you analyse the Saturday game you know it's got nothing to do with off field drama it was just one manager completely outclassing another manager who was relying on individual moments rather then the team as a whole
Nothing changed, maybe it is the Glazers
I thought the leaks were sorted. Jessie lingard  is no longer at the club.. who are the leaks?
Who do you think  these players are getting authority over managers? Simple:- owners
Unpopular opinion: Rashford, Bruno, Dalot have to go. I see non of them getting any better and I think we could do better
I thought ETH said at the start of last season not to have leaks anymore? So what is he going to do about it now?
Stop changing the manager. Change the players who have terrible characters.
DVB will get another chance He’s the most intelligent one
No united manger doesn't see a 3rd sesson and that's a fact!!!
No way the Dutchman fault  its the players  it's a disgraceful spoilt  prats  there paid millions  get them out the club  fans pay there wages  it's on
The English  players are killing united
Imagine if the leak was the kit man or something 😆
Very well said on 99% of today's show 👊🏽
You was speaking to ben foster, he said ten hag shouldnt have called Sancho out the way he did so i see Sanchos reaction perfectly okay
sancho , trashford, and of course mega gob mcquire are the leaks and need to go
The coach is not the problem... As usual... Players believe they are bigger than the club... They will throw another manager under the bus. The day that the players play as a unified team and not as individuals... Maybe things will change
The knifes are out again this only ends one way if we don't start winning to suffocate this continuous BS.
We can't  catch a break. The manager needs our support.
United should have a double agent at every newspaper firm that could give the snitches name
Same ol players and same issues and then some say change the manager like that will solve anything😅
Can we start naming these players who are leaking. We gave them grace the first time. But now they're taking the piss,
Falling out is good
Our squad looks to be no different than last year except the GK, yet we are miles off from even last year. What changed??
How can you say we have the right manager when he picks Mctominay over Pellistri, Rashford without ensuring he starts playing as a team playing not just for himself, and Anthony, despite the fact that he fails in the most important thing he's required to do, which is get down the line and deliver balls into the box.  Is this right manager blind or what?
Maguire one of biggest leaks without doubt
He's got to go.  He is an absolute disgrace.  The fans are disgraceful and he is their champion.  Sack him now and dissolve the club.   He is undermining the board and the fans.  Rashford cant press doesnt suit the modern game.   Whole club stinks at every level.
just have to ask your selves who could replace ten hag there is no one out there out of contract that is at the level that is required for man utd .
Until this club is sold , flattened  to the ground and rebuilt , squad included , we’re going to get worse and no matter what manager we have they will never succeed unfortunately! 😢
Soap opera FC
Keep fighting the fight Mark! Glazers must love all this attention on ETH..
He keeps say "low IQ" and everytime image of Rashford comes to my head. Is he the one..?
If you sack him , who you gonna get . De zerbi ain't gonna go near that dressing room and organization which is a disaster.
It can’t be Sancho he is not in the changing room.
If without United stand ten hag gonna be gone in October
Which player would want to spread rumours about the centre-backs who replaced the previous centre-back and the captain who replaced the previous captain?
Remember last season that Bruno and Casemiro were seemingly arguing and at each others loggerheads apparently last season! So I don't know but ETH must STAY!!!
If they get TH to leave, the club is screwed and ill stop supporting because it will be evident that the club is no longer for the fans or the badge, it's a club to keep the players happy and a marketing stunt
And the glazers thing
Its about injuries and Glazers 😄😂 Come on Mark, ETH has to take responsibility, he coaches and managers that lot and he is clearly starting to lose the dressing room. He has spent 400 million and he coaches them. Can't blame the owners for everything
Watching Manchester united is just pain at this moment.
Lets first get to selecting the correct lineup and play the right tactics then we talk. Until then, we have two away games coming up, what happens if we lose them? How far are we going to fall this season? More and more "low IQ fans" will start singing the same song when we continue to lose. It's inevitable really. It's how sport works.
Not sure why Mark loves ETH so mcuh... because ETH is a manager who is succeed in European 2nd class league??
Everything was spot on Mark especially the point with those ones with the low IQ 😂 great points 👍
Glazers out,absolutely!! But tactics,in game management,fitness,transfers(Mount,Onana,Antony)these are all manager's fault! Really doubt ETH is a top class manager! Last year we we're helped by rivals playing bad and an easy cup draw!!
"Eating popcorn and LOVING this shitstorm" ;)
Prolly Scot as well
bruno is a crap captain
and Rash not making crucial passes at crucial moments is another problem
beginning of the end fot ETH
Leakchester Utd 🙄🙄
Ten Hag and the glazers are literally in bed together…they’re a perfect match. They both need to go.
Back the manager Ten hag in
Is the Utd stand doing statements now too?
ETH wanted to do a Pep or a Mourinho, but he doesn't got the personality for it
Imagine Brighton dominated us with players like Welbeck and Lallana, wow, and we are referring to injuries, its all because tactics and players who lost hope in ETH
Why not both? Ten Hag AND the Glazers are the problem. Why is it always one or the other?
Your just team ten hag  Football is poor get off your high horse and watch the last 5 games back !
you would have to be an idiot to think Ten Haag is THE problem, but I think we are reaching a point where he is becoming part of the problem. He got schooled by De Zerbi, the Glazier family don't pick his tactics. We have signed 4/5 players he wanted and we look shite, at what point is Ten Haag culpable?
It's MAGUIRE....THE LEAK... Always has been.
We will be destroyed against Bayern in my opinion
Sancho maguire
ETH IS CLUELESS. none of his signings would get near the Liverpool team.
People saying it’s ridiculous that Ten Hag may be doing dodgy dealings via transfers, just remember that Ajax knew about Anthony’s charges…. Meaning Ten Hag knew because he was the fucking manager 😂😅!   He pushed United to sign him knowing he had an outstanding case, and then signed him and he’s got another one since.
Why does this only happen at United?
Maguire name was mentioned previously when leaks were discussed and he is still there and getting no game time ??
Keane said it before,   ''A Leopard doesn't change his spots'' these players will throw manager after manager under the bus.
What is the one constant from the leaks during Ole/ Rangnick era? British players there are still leaking dressing room issues to the media
What's astonishing is the change of gameplay character from preseason. We noticed a strong presence in the field but as soon as the season started, this change disappeared, back to the old routine. The winning mentality is absent, eagerness to perform and get results are lacking from some players. It is extremely easy to predict the style and energy of play 5 minutes from kick-off. Watching teams like Inter, Madrid, Arsenal and obviously others, they have this will to win, to go for it- Man Utd players need to unlock this will and stop being fearful. There is much more to say but the gameplay needs to better from the squad.
Time to sell and completely reset the club, noone who has ever worked for united should be hired
Sancho for sure 😂
Players all blame each other and no one will take accountability.  Pointing the finger and not owning up for their own mistakes.
Rashford jogging and pulling his socks during the Brighton match is the highlight...so sad with his lack of efforts
Ole first year he came second  and went to a European final
These "leaks"... You just have to ask which players could potentially benifit from unsettling Ten Hag as manager...
As Shirley Bassey would sing; it's just history repeating. Erik will be gone before November.
It really is groundhog day innit?
Hi
Look we are playing shite rn  All we can do is hope we turn our season around cos if we don’t soon we are done
If I was a manager  I just sent them home an say ur not playing an ur been Dock wages for a week  Make an example
Fernandes is not the captain utd needs
Who says the leaks aren't from higher up?
About time Bruno told Mctominay how shite he is
😂😂😂 I love this craziness!!! Man U my team!! Stop blame the owners!!! It's there club!!! They own the club period!!! Blame the manager firstly!! Then the players!!! Manager select the team and the manager make sub's!!! So who to blame??? Told you all from the beginning that more will come out!!! Viva Sancho!!! 😂🎉🎉🎉 here we go !!!
Who would want to manage Utd. Club is a shambles from top to bottom.
players are paid too much it’s simple
Maguire sancho and Co hoping ten goes so they get another chance to put another manager under bus so they can extend their  contracts and mess manu  up even more
When nothing has changed since previous regimes the proof should be in the pudding for everybody.
You sure didn't have a problem when dressing room leaks started when Mou was the manager.Comparing Mou with this bald clueless fraud is embarrassing.Even for your own low standards.
Maguire is the best defender in the world!!!
Why is TenHag not playing Pellestri? He's way fckin better than any winger right now. Why does he keep playing Bruno on the right? Bruno and Rashford should actually be dropped for some games. They're both moments fc
Back the manager
😂😂😂 “i hate saying i told you so but”
In sm time Ten Hag is gonna be thrown under the bus. Glazers would be still sitting on top. This is a usual cycle at man utd.
Why not you fans concentrate on winning trophies rather than playground football watching?? The Class of 92 werent ever like this....
We need someone who can cross the ball
Eras come to an end Mark
Bruno seems like a shifty guy
I think Ten Hag is a very good coach and the last problem United really have at the moment. The manager will always be the easiest target, but if you sack him it's just papering over the cracks.
3reasons Mark: 1Erick 2Ten 3Hag
To be fair the club aren’t going to come out and say ‘yes there have been fall outs’ are they
Its crazy to me that people still think that the manager is the issue, its been 5+ seasons of sacking managers after a few seasons and u clowns still cant figure it out its laughable. I thought people are meant to geat wiser as they get older not the opposite.
English players doing their thing again
Ten Hag is going down the road we all know, and it gonna end in a sack..... and we don't want it!!!!
Drip drip drip results
how do you compare Mou and Ten Hag, one is a proven winner the other one is just bald.
