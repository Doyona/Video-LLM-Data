very underrated song
JID has the flow of a great lyricist and a voice of the king of pop
Why am I just now hearing this
Kids see ghosts mentioned
This song obviously got buried on purpose
Art
hey bro dont worry you will forget again im here to remind you
and my record clean so i never do shit  🔥
Cudis dance moves make the video
Definition of a perfect song
How am I just know finding this, comment what else this goat Denzel have I’m just know searching him up
This is going to be on repeat for a week plus.
2:02 JID 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
this shouldve been breaking the internet. for such a fire song with such little recognition it pisses me off
kid cudi is my spirit animal!!!
Jid and Ali Tomineek, banger... js
so fuck9ng fire
still hard
2:20 ive been looking for this clip for so long 💔
How TF have I never heard this?
Who's here after Kudi took a stand against the Joker?
Kid Cudi’s verses, style, flow has always been way ahead of its time.
Since Kanye is what he is now can we just get a new KSG with Zel and Cudi instead?
JID carry every verse hahahhaha
where the F**K has this track been all these 2 years!? I'm finding out about it just NOW? shiiiieeet. This goes cold af, straight fuego in here!
Feelin' like that fat Gucci ❄️🌪🔥
Those who know see there are 3 different generations of hip hop at play here and it’s GLORIOUS! This was a banger!
If cudi was rapping like he was on this song on insano it would’ve been great
love the vibe
How i feel in real life after my glow up and making it out the hood.
This beat😘
JID slid harddd
JID ❤
🔥🔥
we need more like this🔊
All 3 of my favorite rappers on one song muh gawd 😮🔥
Not my favorite, but good artists nonetheless.
All I can say is JID
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
i never heard of this colab. i knew KID Cudi...       JID is hard
Black Lisa Simpson is about to smoke tree
🥶‼️‼️‼️
Denzal killed this beat ❤
Never put a JID verse at the end of a song
JID and Zel, Scorpion and Sub-Zero. Album when
10/10 times this in my algorithm I’m listening.
Forgot about this one..
Denzel and JID..im dead. And dumb late. Pissed. Saw them two together and saved it before I even heard it. Now that I heard it, one of the best masterpieces I ever heard. Thank you to the creators for blessing us w this shit ❤ producer needs an award for this shit..cole did his shit too.. extremely well done
4.3m views only,what the fuck???
1:16 why is cudi so zesty???
High quality video content! I have another question: someone transferred me some usdt and I have recovery phrases. 『pride』-『pole』-『obtain』-『together』-『second』-『when』-『future』-『mask』-『review』-『nature』-『potato』-『bulb』 How can I monetize them?
This is a wild trio.  Everyone brought it, but JID ate the heartiest out of the track.
JID NEVER MISSES ONG
I guess it only takes a handfull to overflow the cup.
Denzel one of a kind
the visuals made this song
this shit gave me goosebumps
3 10/10 rap masters and 10/10 video makes 10/10 music video
Hahaha YO TURN THE CC ON!
cudi couldve been left off but still hawd
Denzel n jid both goat
Denzel Curry has a Wu Tang & Three 6 Mafia vibe within him. I hear the influence
Love this <3
Keep it up bruh be different it makes you more you! Good stuff
👁‍🗨
Underrated
When the chorus is harder than any of the verses
⚽️
I thought we already had a DDG
This was ass. Jid’s lil verse was the only decent part
song ds tho😭
Nahhh
why was denzel's verse mixed on a potato
Jid killed his verse
Only here for JID 🔥
song is so 🔥. listen 2 da song bout 1000 times
Surprised this song didn’t do more numbers tbh it’s such a banger definitely deserves more recognition
A dose of dopeness
Funny thing is that JID hasn't even hit his prime yet
💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎

🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆
It’s funny that in the booth it’s sounds like Denzel is too far from the mic, kid cudi is too close, and jid is just right
Ngl when I first seen this I thought JID was juice for a second
I didn't realize how small of a man Cudi was
I’m 2 years late on this one. 🤯 WTH.
JID is magical man..
GOT ME FEELING LIKE IM FAT GUCCI
Haven’t seen cudi go hard in a long time . It’s so nice
give jid any lyrics and he will cook
Korn sample?
I'm leaving this comment here so after a month or a year when someone likes it, I get reminded of this song
Cole you are the corniest director on the planet, y2k wannabe
So slept on
Bruuhh, this is still 🔥
W
People say the DUMBEST SHIT ON THE INTERNET THIS GOOO HATERS ❤❤❤💯👌🏿🦁👩🏿‍⚖️🙌🏿🧠👂🏿👂🏿👋🏿👋🏿👋🏿
Drake still think his an artist not a celebrity
JID❤
JID slid into that first four bars so god damn smooth, I appreciate his double time stuff, but his ability to ride on slower deliveries is wild
Yooo 2024✊🏾🔥🔥🔥
Kid sounds like gravy
Props to the artists. Legends.  BUT- Cole Bennett killed it on this one. 👌
I need a Denzel Curry/JID collab album ASAP

Denzel an animal!
Just realized that the beginning is the same as Never Catch Me by Travis Scott. Wonder if kudi had it first and gave it to Trav or if it was the other way around
Denzel Curry was on God mode on his verse🔥🔥
Cole make the blink and Wayne song we’ve all wanted
Fyah
Jid nd denzel tho

That boy J.I.D don't miss🗣🔥
the eagle creeps, the devil can not hold the middle finger how it be. 🏛️

Hold on, someones at my door
Why Cudi acting so zesty 😂
1:25
This is greatness J.I.D  be straight slayin' the game, no doubt! *AUTHENTIC VIEWS* gave him a boost, but his raw talent remains unchanged. He's holdin' it down like a true boss! Drop a thumbs up if you're vibin' with it, fam!
Denzel is so fucking fire dude! 💥💥
When Denzel says "take you for a ride" is the moment the song takes the fuck off.
Cudi the GOAT
This beat sucks ass🔥🔥
JID carried tbh
Everyone killed it
Cudi needs to retire 🔥
Was looking for that old school sound & visuals! Well done 😎😎😎

0:13 AYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYy
YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

🔥
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
lol i love dis song

Just before kid cudi's verse when he starts doing the adlibs is it just me or is he zesty af right then 😅
truth be told JID is the new J COLE
Kid Cudibis like the New School snoop dog. The only unlocked character in the rap game that does whatever he wants
2 chainz would’ve Murked this onsoul
Ski would kill this shit
Негри скачут
Cudi is having so much fun
When the teacher puts all the best students in same group project
The music video is crazy, shout out to colebennet
Tequila shots is a masterpiece
💪🏿💪🏿
“ That money you be seeing me with on my instagrams, that be fake money man, that be PROP money this is not my money bruh I have NOTHING “
Современно
the Cudi adlib at 1:26 is so fucking crisp
props to Denzel for making the Lisa Simpson do popular again
Why did I not know this was out
1:50 Cudi's flow 🥶
I'm late with this but this is fire
This shit  is fire
WoW WhoA
JID is Tupac  reincarnated
Годнота, качает.
"Tell me, what the fuck do people know about the bros? Bunch of pie flippin' niggas, they don't work at Dominos" Idk why I find this verse hard and funny at the sometime 😂🔥
Denzel curry and kld cudi so fucking unrated
Shit like this get me so hype about to get in the car real quick so can  blast this
So good i liked it twice
Like kids see ghosts 👻
Very talented flow and performance but depressed bit
If I see the fxcking whopper add one more time bro…
Denzel never miss 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
How and where  When bullets  Fly  You better duck  And just know  It's not my fault you got shot  Keep the speakers on the low  What changes things  I'm not sure why  Let's here questions then we will know
Yall hyping up mid, this song is ass
Boy said gimme "da Lisa Simpson" 🤣
This one goes out to my ex Monika
Shit wack af
bro this deserves 300 mil views and a grammy
When Denzel was doing his walk then it zoomed to them all sitting side by  I was oh shit bc damn that was cold . Best music video ever
2 chains I'm different hook fits perfectly on this beat.
Denzel’s lyrics, Cudi’s adlibs, JID’s flow, Dot’s beat, and Cole Bennett as the director. This should be a huge song
This is one of those songs where everyone carried. Dot’s beat goes so hard, Denzel’s hook, Cudi’s adlibs, and JID’s verse makes this song so good
The beat goes so hard in this song
JID!!!!😫😫
kid cudi ❤️
Came here for Zel, but I get goosebumps whenever I hear Cudi, dude is forever linked to me trauma.
J.I.D is like eminem you get him on a track it's no longer your track lmao
Playboy cradi vibe
I want a Denzel JID and Ski Mask song

Hearing cudi spit like this with two lyrically elite rappers is 🔥
My heart fills with joy every time I see Denzel and JID collaborate on a track. 2 of the very best of the "new school" of rappers, keeping the lyrical style alive.
I love the production. It's the guitar for me
I hate that I just heard this why youtube

This is underrated
song of the year
Younger me would be so disappointed in what kid Cudi became, Denzel and Jid went hard asf tho
🐐🐐🐐
🔥🔥
The "explode" part in JIDs verse is cold 🥶 🔥
Dot's verse was the hardest.
🔥
Denzel Curry sounding like French Montana, can anyone else hear that or am I tripping
JID went fucking OFFFF
hahahah nice
these underrated rappers
GOT DAYUMMM
good chemistry between the dudes
Can't believe this actually happened. Incredible. 🙏🏾🔥

Absolute banger, 🔥 collab 🔥
OG

Free beat here 👇👇🤙  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnU7N6gRYbw
cudi so funny ahaha
why cudi so zesty
Best cudi verse in a long time
I feel like this should have more views
Cudi got the best Adkins on earth
Does this clip only have almost 3 million views? In moral it deserves 10 million views at least until the end of the year, this song is heavy
Cudi disappointed me unfortunately off this one or maybe I was just expecting more idk. Anyone agree or no?
This song was criminally underrated
Cudi verse ass af
Denzel man if you see this check out Baby Franco pleeeeeease
bro that was gooooood 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

ǝɟᴉl ʎɯ pǝƃuɐɥɔ ɟɟolO ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Oloff changed my life
Rumour has it one time Oloff was sat next to Jar Jar Binks on a flight. Jar Jar kept kicking the chair in front of him and generally being obnoxious, nobody knew what to do. Eventually one of the flight attendants came over and asked Oloff if he would perform one of his songs to calm Jar Jar down, and when Oloff began rapping the first verse to Doing It Stealthy, Jar Jar immediately relaxed. To this day the two are still close friends.

Oloff is the greatest living artist
Doing It Stealthy helps me to process my feelings about 9/11.
I listen to Doing It Stealthy when I'm experiencing existential dread. It makes it worse but... I just can't stop.
Jid carried again 😩😮‍💨
THIS IS IT
only jid could have a bar ab digornos pizza and still sound hard
Denzel look like sonic the hedgehog with his hair like dat
Im sorry, but this is one of the best videos cole has made
bro how is Cudi so cool
Dope! #oddyhigh ! ✅✅💥💥💥💥💨💨💨💨
🔥🔥🔥🔥
The beat sounds like Rodeo Travis
There’s good smoke and there is bad smoke. Son, this kind of smoke could change the world! They brought the smoke! Known to some as smog, this super high end smoke is only for like chief keef mf. Smoke dis shit and you will go to mars. They brought the smoke for sure.
Cudi got carried hard here. Ngl.
🙂
waaaaaaaaaaaao
Whoever mixed this did jids verse too quiet
He looks like odb
I love the running in place dance Denzel does in this
errbody ona block talk bout me
You guys are even cooler together... (Sorry I’m a 50 year old Mom and kinda outta the loop) but, I love it! ... I may be old but I’m also old school... grew up in a skating rink with Run DMC, Grand Master Flash and the Sugar Hill Gang..... I’m no stranger to the beat
I wanna see Denzel and Tyler the Creator collab.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🇬🇭🇬🇭🇬🇭🇬🇭🇬🇭
cudi is one of my favourite rappers but ngl jid and denzel carried this track
Yas!!!!!!!!! We need full album 💿 please & thank you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
NGL the beat switch is HORRIBLE. only good thing about this song is the hook beat. Rest is 🗑
Blessed the GODS
This needs more views
Kid kudi🔥
This is my favorite type of new school rap. Lyrical content but mainstream beats. Also JID is one of the best rappers of all time. That's right I said it 👀
Denzel and Dot Da Genius went stupid on this track, cudi and JID did their thing
Dis song needs to be in Forza & GTA
Kid Cudi 4 Life Brother Denzel Curry is the goat  Brother JID is dope  Brother Dot Da Genius is a legend Yea bruv
Which one of them does the yea mm
It's a hard work,but it has too little views.....
Goosebumps or is it jus me
This song was suppose to be legendary with these artists, but instead the beat makes it so mediocre.
Gotcha boi feeling like im phat gucci
Was this on minions ???
kid cudi’s voice is just so perfect for any song
wave
Why there are so few views on this masterpiece?
jid absolutely bodied this
😳
cudi can make cleveland sound like the best place in earth

Legendary💯
Denzels been ripping NWA again. He loves that Dopeman shit!
Cudi chilled in the pocket on this song. He found the flow 🌊
If these guys knew there bad ass they would rock / rap this world

I met Oloff at a supermarket once and asked him ''How did you write Doing It Stealthy?'' he didn't answer, he was too busy paying for his asparagus.

Oloff is the greatest rapper of all time, apart from the guys in Blazin' Squad
Before I started listening to Oloff I was depressed, homeless and had erectile dysfunction. I'm still homeless and depressed but my boners are crazy now.
My mom is such a huge Oloff fan that she got the lyrics to 'Doing It Stealthy' tattooed across her breasts.
Doing It Stealthy helps me to process my feelings about 9/11.
I listen to Doing It Stealthy when I'm experiencing existential dread. It makes it worse but... I just can't stop.
I listen to Doing It Stealthy on the train, and if the train doesn't go fast enough I slap the driver on the back of the head

People that say Zel is overrated or isn’t underrated, just know that this great of a rapper has less listeners than 6ix9ine and the same listeners as Lil Pump 💀
Why tf is this so mid? It literally has no right to be
Воу,  неожиданно очень круто,) это хит, молодцы) удачи в будущем)
Jid✔🔥🔥

Hard
Been a while since I bop hard! Everything bout' this is fireeee!
2:21 'Tell me what the fuck do people know about the bro's, bunch of pie-flippin' niggas they don't work at dominos' probably the smoothest beginning to a verse I've ever heard. The whole flow and delivery is immaculate.
Denzel curry carried

Denzel curry nobody’s talking about you I didn’t I thought you fell of but no disrespect tho he still kinda a good rapper but at the end of the day everybody gone have they opinions but You know what drake said it is what it is
The distorted kicks are so perfectly timed. I can't say enough about this production. It pumps me up so much yet it sounds so cool and laid back. Truly inspirational.

Why does Kid Cudi sound like Yung Gravy

Denzel is always full of surprises
I like cudi but that's trash, trash since ksg
Sometimes this motherfucker land gold
Kid Cudi needs a solo music video with Cole Bennett
A M A Z I N G
Zels hook sounds like he’s trying to get in the tik toks loops. His verse is good, if he brought that “bloodshed” vibe to this it would Of been fire. Cudi needs to leave off the travis Scott vibe adlibs too, he has his own style that’s great
You wouldn't have imagined this ever happening. This collaboration lit 🔥
0:50 me going downstairs to get food at 3AM
No cap Denzel could’ve used better rhyming words. Seemed like a hella basic rhyme scheme for someone like him.
Brabos! Br aqui🇧🇷

Kinda disappointed this was a legendary collab but honestly wasn’t that good they definitely didn’t try their hardest
Cudi is a goat but def wasn’t needed on the song his adlibs where ten times harder then his verse… he tried to hard was not lyrically prepared to keep up with WENZEL WURRY and W.I.D LMAO
3 of my favorite artists
Got my black air forces on who wanna hang?

For God so loved the world he gave his only Son whoever believes in him shall not perish but have everlasting life John 3:16
Denzel + Cudi + JID + A FIRE BEAT MAKE MAGIC LOOK LIKE BULLSHIT  Its insane
denzel was the fuel, cudi is the spark, and jid was the fire 🔥

Jid verse is incredible 🔥🔥
This track is BUSSINN
Asap rocky would of went  hard on this 🫡
Great track zel was on ten in this joint cudi handle his business and gave us those melodies his verse is over shadowed I feel tho jid was great of course he was in his element took the beat and ate it💯
JID is absolutely insane 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Denzel curry is part the greatest freshmen XXL list but don't get recognition the one he deserves
i’m 9 days late
J.I.D And Uzi would make a dope album together. (Like how wayne and tpain did it.)
I need an album with all of them 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Jid got smoked by Denzel after he’s been saying rappers don’t wanna hop on a track with him lol
that was good
Sound like kid cudi back with flow?⌛️is kid cudi back with the flow⏳
.75 speed sound wildddd omggg
Trash I'm sorry tell the truth smh

Denzel and Cudi so Hard a Complex 🏌️

This is awful stuff I became  addicted  Now I need more 😩
kid cudi's voice 🥵 GOD
Zellllllll
When you don't expect it, it can only be better
wtf  never click so fast
cudi rocking the '12 steez like crazy
Always the hottest
🔥
I feel like J.I.D knew he had the potential to absolutely go off. But he backed off to keep at the others level. Still a great song though
и
JID might be the most underrated doing it right now  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
the beat is crazy
I expected more, jid saved it though & the hook is cold
!!!
what can i say it’s fire 🤷🏼‍♀️🔥
This shit fire
alright this was mid
This beat is garbage tho
WHY KID SNAP LIKE THAT YOOOOOOOOOO
<3
Denzel is so fine.

A minute in I already know denzel cappin 🥱🥱 next.
these my guys linked up, cant believe my eyes what im hearing is some how no suprise
This is one of the most solid tracks I've heard in at least the past year, probably even longer than that but I won't be hyperbolic.  Everything about it just fits perfectly.  Straight up banger.
Ima cudi fan this ain’t it fam , I like that humming shit.
Damnnn 💣💣💣💣🤯🤯denzel lirics 💣💣
Cudi's flow 🔥
And J.i.D verses be crazy too 🥶🥶🥶
Curry never fucking fail every verse is crazy 🥶🥶🥶🥶

old school in new school
When all the smart kids in class get put on the same group project.

Cudi and Denzel makes the world go around 🔥🔥🔥🐐🐐
👍🏽

Did they sample Never Catch Me by Travis Scott?
Masterpiece

The hair cut looks like Rick's hair or Lisa Simpson
JID destroys every beat he gets put on to and feature he never misses just straight bars🔥🔥💯💯

Cudi became Maxo Kream for a verse with that flow and i’m not mad about it
Could’ve left dot off the song 😂
Denzel Curry really out here lookin like a super saiyan
Curry tuned to eleven at the end 🤣🔥
Hard!
Cudi’s first RAP beat… And he killed it. 🔥
Cudi's "yeah" is everything
Jid never misss! #atl
🔥🔥🔥   Much love from Houston TX!!!!
cudi being goofy is the funniest shit ive ever seen
This is fire flames. Not the Collab we asked for, but the one we needed.
Easily the best song of the year.
Denzel out hear loking like Kenpachi Zaraki and I'm loving it
Damh this song is underwhelming
The collab we didn't deserve....but rejoice we got it <3
I just wanna thank God and the artists for making this track happen
OMFG i haven't even listened to it but the line up alone has me geeking
Cudi is the perfect icing on the cake to this song
fire
Hard beat 🔥🔥 Nice Collab
Zel and jid are gonna be the two biggest in hip hop one day man cmon

🇹🇻🇹🇻🇹🇻♑💓Everyone is responsible for what happens and has the power to decide what they want to be. Who you are today is the result of your past decisions and choices. What you will be tomorrow will be the result of your actions today.
fire no cap

This beat really screams kid cudi.
That beat feels like i am in a wasteland killing off zombies.🔥
Pure hiphop.
W song
JIDDDDDDDD 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I'm from Cleveland I loved Cudi since Day n Night first dropped.. can't look at him the same lately tho 👗
0:50 me going downstairs to get food at 3AM
I didn’t think I needed this, but I surely did. Anything with Cudi is something I need, but damn, this was a lot better than I expected.
damn this shit hard
Been a good minute since I heard something from since Mr kid kid needs to drop some new fire some THC tracks #2022godofrap
The features are just perfect
https://youtu.be/bpYEHEL3-8g
aint heard kudi ride a beat like this in a bit, he killed it
cudi's verse was absolutely fire
I can’t shake the fact that JID looks like a young  Michael Jackson
This is like my dream come true lmao
This is the best song we've seen on Lyrical Lemonade this year. such a fun record
jid's flowswitches are so on point luv it
Dislike heavy.
🔥🔥
Я здесь один русский 😅😋
This shit could not be hot!!💎 Denzel is back, JID fire, and the Legend kudi🙏🏿💜

Let’s be honest. Only jid did his thing
so glad I stopped listening to rap. This suit is literal garbage, my god
and again JID murders the verse
Mid + stop stealing

Song is on REPEAT BRO
The beginning sounds like fight club...
Background music sounds like schoolboy q song
🗡️🗡️🗡️🦾
I dont even like cudi but his verse was awesome
Insane!!
Is Cudi balding?
Hard beat + JID = 🔥
Why is this not blowing up
toasted lisa simpson spiting some bars
https://youtu.be/TDgxlHgtmI4
Kid cudi in gode mode
This is legit like Miami's Big Three. If they put out an entire album I would never listen to anything else again.
So dope how they both brush cudi’s shoulders when he about to spit fire , they all dope
Am i wrong or did they sample one of the Travis scott songs from rodeo deluxe
This is great
Disappointed
I love how different each flow is
くそかっこいい
Let's gooooo 🔥🔥
Shit so mid lol
THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE 🔥  Here Before 1 week 💯
Cudi👀
YO WHAT, CUDI RAPPING NOT SINGING LETS GO MORE PLEASE. AND WITH CURRY AND JID IDEK WHAT TO SAY BRO <3
Imagine corpse hop in this beat
When JID changed his flow, just took it to the moon
That beat tho
Oh yeah didn't know this summer needed this joint fire 🔥
Denzel 🔥
kinda lit
first verse was garbage, rest was fire
mid
kid cudi looking like the uncle who tries hard to be cool 🤣
How did these legends end up in a booff ?!
JID is insane
Jid 🥶🥶
RELOOOAD ITTTT
Need a JID and 21 the kinds of features
Carti poncho
Damn cudi Fr overrated
Kid cudi! and Denzel fucking legendary
While I'm not a fan of the heavy auto tune, the song itself is a fucking banger and I genuinely didn't expect to like it. I found myself iffy at first not sure if I like it then Kid comes in and just goes fucking hard, then I found myself singing the chorus but once it ended I expected it to keep going. I didn't want the song to end, this is some real good shit.
Visuals are sick
This ain’t it, especially for cudi
Yo jid on some shit💨💨💨
If they don’t give this man jid rapper of the year for the next 5 years , something’s wrong in this world
Its just not good. So many names and this trash shit.
Kid Cudi is the greatest artist out there
Where minion
I'm convinced J.I.D. can't make a bad verse!!!!!!!
The hook is so fucking catchy it’s actually gross I’ve been singing that shit for days since I listened
JID's flow !!!! 🔥🔥🔥
Denzel curry got the Lisa Simpson going on 😂
3 of some of my favourite artist rn. this is legendary
JID is smooth af
Hook is legit gas, so gassy ethanol can't mix .
kid cudi damn near 40 years old what are you doing bro
been waiting on sum like this
Cheapest song I've ever heard. Coming from a massive Cudi fan
Denzel carried heavy holy shit
this is heeeeat🔥🔥
This is trash.  Seriously. This is nothing catchy, they all have different flows that change up and doesn't go together.  Nothing about this makes me want to bump to this.
Daaaaamn kid kudi smoked this shit 😮‍💨
Denzel look like he can play a villain
🔥 📛 👨‍🚒 🚒 🧯 🎆 🔥 📛  every one killed this
Denzel and cudi need a whole album together
Dope collab
O.O) mmm
Oh we need some more of these! 🔥
Cudiiiiiiiii!!!!🔥🔥🔥
I lost my grandma back in September due to COVID, and I just dropped a song on my channel that I wrote for her. Hope it can reach anyone who has gone through something similar.👵🏾🧡🥺
lets go my boy cudi and curry
JID killed that shit
They hit us with that Wombo Combo
Ooohhhh weeee kudi and jid ateeeeee that bitchhhh
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This is dope
yooo this is the cudi we NEED
Cudi dancing like the dude from disposable me
Kid cudi coulda did better DC came correct as always
Denzel's verse was insane with this beat🔥🔥
This collab look fake asf 😂
Nah guys get good at rapping first.
Pretty dope……
Curry looking like a rock gym leader
Cudi staying relevant without knowing what tiktok is truly is a vibe
This is the type of song u call good but never listen to it again.
not a good song. denzels flow was mid even though he usually impresses. kid cudi is and has been washed for many years now. beat was so boring, JID was forgettable. the video itself looked like a 2010 Bad Boy records video. overall i'm really not satisfied with this homogenous product
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Saw kid cudi and was like “what is this???” Lol
Incredible 🔥🔥
jesus christ, what year is it..
JID snapped gah dayum, his flow was crazy
Cudi wearing Jordans like fuck ye
JID > Kendrick Lamar
I thought this was going to be different, dare I say better, than what it came out to be.
J.I.D🔥🔥
The hook 🔥🔥
holy shit cole making mvs like it’s 2000s
This collab is too much!  It's too powerful. Imagine if there was an album between them. I wouldn't listen to anything else.
Alright DJ Chello
Exculpating Exculpatory
So... they just gave J.I.D 20 seconds at the end so people actually listen to the whole song all the way through?
These are the type of rappers that need to be promoted and supported, not no lil baby 21 savage or random letter gang gang rappers that talk about the same shit!
This video is proof we are not all equal
Swear to god kid dude says yeah like yum
Finally some good old school hip hop
Cudi cool, but that space blanket ain’t it 😂
song so good it made the bots start praising it😭
dope love what cudi still going hard n salute to dot da genius for listen this cudi year glad he doing features
Best part of this song was when Cudi said Yeeaahhh
1st half of the song is good. Second half is shitty
What!?!!!?! Hell yeah!!!
This is 🔥
mob psycho rage beat 🥴
pretty lame tbh
meh
Yo new fav song  Finna bump on repeat
Had to stop song once I heard this delivery not digiorno. RIP the Truth
Curry deserves his Roses
This comment section full of riders hahahah this was ight though
Cudi not in a dress?
And he does it again 👏🏾
Dot da genius is da genius
glad to see that cudi knows what real talent looks like
Killed it
JID too raw 🔥
This video tho🔥🔥🔥🔥keep an eye out for Dirt Dawgz
This shit is fucking trash jid could not save these dudes man they got no skills😂
yo this is culture right here
Wish Travis Scott was on this

Gay cudi

Denzel just killed
Holyyyyyyyyyy
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Truly the movie of all time.
This is 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
CaDiiiForever
Dot snapped!!!!!!
This song went stupid hard because I understood when he says 8 ball with out the pool stick
J COLE DESERVED A VERSE ON THIS
PEOPLE ONLY KNOW WHAT YOU ALLOW  THEM TO SEE. BOO  🔥👻🤟🏽🕊
The verses are great but the production IS IMMACULATE
jid разьебал я считаю
mid
Cudi and jid nice
J.I.D straight carried them no cap

Song of the years 😉
This sounds so unique, it's hard to put my finger on it.
Denzel went in. This beat is hard
JiD saved this track
Damn this song is disappointing
Hook giving 2 chainz

Esto tenía que pasar y paso 🖤
https://youtu.be/3LgaStphJ4c
Im sorry but the beat was wack. Verses didnt hit because the beat was wack. 🤷🏾‍♂️
This kinda trash
this is such a strange mix of rappers
🌚🌞
Cudi looking zesty asf in the silver suit 😂
The Songoku boy with big teeth annoy me

Underrated goats united

JID reminds me of kendrick
🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
To think I almost never clicked on this video…..
This shit wack nope 👎
HARD
this ring thing triggered me twice !
Its weird that JID is easiest the most talented person on this song, has the most creative flow, and the most to prove. Bro really is the best rapper since Kendrick, and Cole knew it
Ah this shit crazy💯
Looool what tf did i just listen to 🤣🤣🤣
Fuck it they all went hard

Don't want to offend other artists, but daaamn J.I.D's verse was a straight FIRE
Holyyyyyyy shi🔥🔥
👍🔥
Cole tapped in HARD on this one
Holy. Fucking. Shit.
sound like a KoRn sample, shit goes hard
Is denzel growing his dreads back?
unfortunately it is mid
Ooooh my God
They have this shit in 5k bro...
Did Dot sample "Man Of The Year" or am I buggin?
I been screaming Cudi's name for years but JID bruh!😫 This nigga never seem to back down, Denzel is just out of this world fr🔥
witch house is back
Cudi has a flow that's addicting
Damn this goes crazy, everyone did their part 🔥
I’m not gonna lie, I expected more🤷‍♂️
damn kudi sounds NICE when his verse comes in denzel on top of the game this year cant believe im saying this but all the jid guest features are starting to sound very same-y
Hey! That #headbanger tag was used in kid cudis "da new new" song way back in tha day!!
BRRUUUH 3GEN TOGETHERS
Shit bangz 🔥🔥🔥 Yuuuuuummm
How is this not trending? 3 cold verses, a dope production, and a Cole Bennett music video. Shits 🔥🔥
This is a true, certified hood classic. This what happens when everyone does their part on the project
🔥🔥🔥
I’m here for it 🤘🏾🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥☄️☄️☄️☄️☄️
sick video but this song sounds horrible, too many weird noises cant even hear a beat
⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
can't listen without 1.5 speed,2 different songs
This was so 🔥🔥🔥
Cudi kinda killed the vibe imo
Cringe affff
Came out of nowherw
10/10, and just watch Denzel's tiny desk, also 10/10
Can we talk about Cudis' astronaut piece? SHEEEEESH.
"Pull up in a phantom like Kids See Ghosts" was a great bar and a great transition to the cudi verse
Curry is great, JID delivers as always and I’m glad cudi has still got it, absolute banger
Can do better but alright
🔥🔥🔥
the beat is reminding me of a certain reggie & the full effect song.
Man this channel hasn't been the same💔
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Hook was weak
Can we say KidCudi a Legend/Staple now… I swear y’all been counting Cudder out the game😮‍💨
Harder than diamonds
Banger Track
Mid
this collection of niggas is like the planets aligning, geez
Excuse the fuck outta me 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 denzel ate the fuck outta this track and they all killed it. Love those ambient dark sounds in the back gives it such a different fresh vibe.
Denzel a n d Jid!?!!?! holy fuck
Yo where did this come from? Thank You!
Denzel killed this . Wow,
Holy Shit 🤌🔥🔥
Cudi should've just done a chorus lol
1:21 isnt that what carti wore in the LV show
This makes me want a lyrical lemonade cypher every year for independent artists 🔥🔥🔥
This song didnt need cudi honestly
Tf is cudi wearing
kid cudi verse was weak shoulda just been denzel and jid respect to the legends tho
!
how kid cudi has broken the chains to follow his frequency is amazing
Last dude messed up the song
🔥
Cudi screwed up
Fodaa
Three of my favorites. Damn this dope
denzel floated on this beat dayyyuuuuummm
Just needs Isaiahrashad on this joint
In my white tee In my white tee
Cudis voice is so electric you just know it’s him.
kid cudi look like sb drunk uncle at the cookout😂
Really 90's vibes type of feel with the video. Lens and all.
Based off of rapping ability, J.I.D is top 5 rappers right now
🇧🇷
Banger
🥶
Unexpected collab but great.
Denzel disappointed on this one.
Which one was dot da genius?
shit slaps harder than a alcoholic step-dad
Jid mannnnn... Dammmmm
Give me Vince Staples at the end and it can't be beat
This video goes so so hard, I’ve never seen a hook done in video form before 😂 next level fr Cole, keep rising
Cudi the 🐐
I'm living for this 🔥🔥
JID look like DC youngfly...
JID and Denzel carry

Daaaaaaaaamnn shit burnin
This collaboration just hit levels I never knew existed 🏌‍♂️absolute gem🤺
Awww man, I was hoping this song would be 🔥😭
33. clean
Song and video excellent. And these brilliant artists look like they're just having fun performing.
The new age Wu-Tang? I think so.
I remember finding out about jid years ago thinking how I swore he’d be on the same level as like a j cole or at least somewhere in that spectrum but it seems like he just got stuck on a certain level. Wish he’d get more love
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Zel fits these kind of beats
Trill $hit!
how are the views so low best artists on LL in a minute
that intro took me back to Travis' Never Catch Me
DOT DA G.
Holy shit this is gonna be crazy🔥🔥
All around great song tbh liked Cudis verse as always and his signature humming in the back was great!
AHHHHHHH JIDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
DAMN
JID slaughtered that shit
oooo good good
I think it's missing ski still fire tho
Kodak on dis would go crazy too
Am I back to 2000’s ?
Denzel is to underrated she should really upterr
1:10 the smoke was hard🔥🔥🔥
finally mainstream lol
This song is amazing. Is it wild that I would want to hear Joey BadA$$ on here too?
I honestly hate denzel curry and this song didn’t change my mind 😭 jid is tuff tho I love him
Probably the best Collab in the past 2 years. This is greatness.
🔥🔥🔥
So happy to see cudi working with these artist and Cole Bennet
This >>> Cash In Cash Out
Only J.I.D can go after Cudi
Dot always got that outer space vibez on the beats
🔥🇿🇦
Solid hook
Damnnn🔥
bro the cudi adlibs are so damn goofy
Everybody on the block talk about me🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This is so bad ass and put together so well
Why do I think zillakami would've killed on this too?
NAH ALL 3
This line-up is CRAZY! This song, not so much... I expected this to be so much doper than this was.
🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐

Can't believe I'm bout a week late on this heat damn.
Feels like I was just playin kick ball with Zel lil uglah at the park. Now he on the track with CuDi & Dot big as he wanted to be to be fr shit wild 💭
Yo that cudi verse holy shit.
New favorite song . That classic Cudi “DAMN” at 1:25 gave me chills. Everybody ate on this shit I’m telling you!!!! 😮‍💨🔥⛽️😤

Hell yes. Pumped to see O Dot prominently pictured in this. Him and Cudi since day one. That intro sounds like WZRD.
I've got the feelin, they all are rappin on a other beat. Feels wrong to me
Kid Cudi 🔥
Cudder back on the moon
Talking about someone can be good or bad depending on what is said. Spirituality is speaking no words, but showing everything.
All these guys deserve their roses for real.
Cudderrrrrr

Let's be real, this was mid and Cudi was the worst.
Why this go so hard
why it gets less views than fucking minion yeat soundtrack

All star cast rh 😈
This was so fire, but IMO Kid Cudi didnt bring the same vibe
Heat
Denzel killed it. Great hook, great verse.
shit has been downhill for Denzel since TA13OO
Is it just me or JID starts to look like a combination of J.Cole and Kendrick?
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
YouTube shorts brought me here
Kid cudi is so cringe 😭😭
JID THE GOAT
Lyrical lemonade video of the year
Kinda reminds me of B.Q.E. the Kota, Joey Bada$$, Bas collab

JID destroyed this mf track bro. Hands down the best verse on here🔥
What a line up🔥
This was fire. Unique atmospheric track with great diversity 🎶✌
We need a JID and Eminem collab bruh
Video is so fire
legends and straight horrible versus haha
Curry killed it as usual. But it's a relief to see Kid Cudi not wearing a dress.
Denel is the GOAT
JID the smartest move j cole has done but has failed to utilize him 100% thus far
Love ❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️
kid cudi shoulda just did the hook tbh.  and not a verse on this song.
Denzel curry got the best album 💿 better than Kendrick better than drake  His  album heals my mental 🍄
This was needed
Dope Song Dope Video Dope Artists I want a album from JID and Denzel, hell they've done enough features to make a small album at this point

anything JID hops on instantly turns it into a hood classic
Ой неужели открыли доступ ?…
this is JID's song now.
All I saw was them in the thumbnail and that's all I needed lol
denzel carried
🔥
I knew this song was go sound like shit
they all look so cool
Am I the only one who was kinda disappointed and thought this was going to be better than it was , I've loved kid Cudi since like 2010 when I was still in high school and denzel and jid are my two favorite newer guys but honestly the chorus and jids verse was the only part of this I liked .....I hope it grows on me over time
Cudi carried
Does this sample Never Catch Me By Travis Scott at 0:02-0:04
What in the world🔥🔥🔥🔥
Denzel Curry and Cudi are my favorite artists. Happy to see them together.
JIDs verse goes fucking stupid hard
The room with all the green is trippy like damn
Duki
Holy shit this song is insane
HOLY BIBLE ---5 Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth; fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry: 6 for which things' sake the wrath of God cometh on the children of disobedience: 7 In the which ye also walked some time, when ye lived in them. 8 But now ye also put off all these; anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy communication out of your mouth.
🔥🔥🔥🔥
so gooddd broo
Another Legend to put on the list for Lyrical Lemonade
Man J.I.D is 🔥lit
I’m not going to lie Kid Cudi ruined the song
🔥
JID so goated man its effortless to him

Nice :)
🔥
JID and Denzel but no Kenny Mason, so close...  dont get me wrong i fuck with Cudi hard, I just really wanna see these 3 on a track together.
can't lie JID saved this song from being absolute ass
Jid smoke everything
Who ever fit the genius is I like you because you got jid Denzel and cudi on a future
yuhhhh
Cudi been on weird shit but we gon ignore that cuz this collab is fire ….
I know what I know & that's pointing out what Snoop is talking bout'
Dude is wearing a puff daddy 1999 classic shiny coat
Cudi just dominated...but I like the three together
Way back in the day you used to doupt me
imagine if nardwuard listened to this
Cudi goofy af
Legendary
this is fucking amazing
This collab stupid ima have this on repeat for the next year lol. Video go dumbbb too. One of my biggest goals is to ever do a video with Cole Bennett. I just released my first music video, i don't like to self promote but it's hard to get heard nowadays so figured i'd share. To anyone that checks it out and shows any support , i love you forever!!!!  Love <3
Is it wrong to say lyrical lemonade is dated af now, dude hasn’t switched his style in 5 years
MID
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
NAAAAAAAAAAH JID 🔥🙌🏾
His first real music video
JIDDDDDD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The BEAT.
Cudi killed this 🔥
JID flow go stupid bruh fr
geez that lit  my house on fire
Always loved Denzel and JID I don't really listen to carti all the time but he sound good on a song sometimes also Dot sound dope asf🔥
Wow so many b-list artists on a track exactly what u would expect
NEEEEEED MORE OF THESE FOUR
the way cudi slid on the beat though 🔥
J.I.D   That’s all I have to say
God damn this song, excellent collaboration pure fire🔥
Jid SMOKED Denzel but I heard some kids saying “ man this feature run Denzel is on is crazy” 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Kid Cudi kinda ruined this imo his lyrics are so basic lmao, "women wanna have my children", "goin rage mode", "too cold", "realest niggas", "dont want no static", "im faded". dude stuck in 2010 with these commonly used  generic bars. Denzel had me at first, in the mood to jump on some random dudes car and start  wilin but Kid Cudi dropped the bar.
Dot da genius production is so distinct
Jid about to out rap Denzel again
Damn denzel carried
hearing cudi made me realise ferg would kill this beat
Why is JID not a bigger star?  He is Top 5 of the gen z rappers
this might be one of my favourite videos
Kid Cudi prolly wearing a thong
Talk about mee
Holy fuck this is great
kanye distroy kid career fck kudi 😭😭😂
JID need to work w Kendrick
damn cole style gone generic. happens to the best of em.
Jid was on this! 🔥
We need to make this song dope af... just call Denzel asap
3/5 of my top 5 on a track, wow!
Come on bro drop the minions x yeat video.  I CANT WAIT ANY LONGER.
this beat is bonkers
peep 17
I know this random But I wish Tyga was on the remix he would legit kill this beat
Curry and jid killed it 🔥🔥🔥
I listen to everything that Denzel and Jid put out Now they've made a song together Godamnnn
oh wow
Bruh why does it say the upcoming minions video is blocked in the US
the 4 irrelevant rappers team up to make a song 🔥
EARLY
Not enough love for the production Dot did in the comments, shit was hard.
🙏
Definition of mid
I never knew I needed Cudi and denzel on the same song till now. The visuels are crazy, the production is amazing and everyone's verses were amazing. This song and music video is amazing
The kids see ghosts line was fire
How does this not have millions of views already!
"Pull up in a phantom like kids see ghosts" while being on a song with cudi himself has to be one of the hardest flexes in this universe .
THIS THE BOUNCE SHEESH!!!!!!!!
Cudi too drippy  WHERE TF IS THE JID ALBUM THO
Curry 🔥🔥🔥
What's going on with cuddy?
I've never heard of Denzel, I am woe about this fact, and I've missing out. This song is 🔥🔥🔥
BRO THATS FIRE!!!
Glad to see the bro denzel curry doing good. There times I’ll jam ultimate or imperial an just appreciate stuff 😂✊🏽💯
JID.. DENZEL.. CUDI.. Genius.. ALL IN ONE SONG.. PINCH ME FAM
this hits like a late 2000s banger
The title should be ft. Goats
W legendary collab
Wow
dead
No way this just happened
Getting RHCP - Otherside vibes off some parts of this video... looks sick.
Cudi's verse gave me them Man on the Moon vibes !!
Jids fuckin flow. He’s just like mac. “Never missing a beat”
This is criminally underrated
JID carried the song
Jid literally never disappoints.
It s very incredible thanks lyrical lemonade
cool video..
OMG !!!!
10/10 lineup
Jid had the best verse
🔥
Cudi SZN
Never did I ever imagine this Collab ever happening 🔥🙌🏾
Cudi just will never stop going hard, the flow still immaculate
Cole you went crazy on this one🎥
🔥🔥🔥
Sounds like a class project but still kinda 🔥
Cudi ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Oh wow, yesterday I was reading a comment on Denzel's channel that how people need him and jid to collaborate!!!
Denzel with another banger
Cudi has lost the ability to rap
Yeah hu hu, Kid Cudi got to harmonize somewhere or otherwise he's not really there
4ft in one song, in it always be only 3minutes😂
J.I.D!!!!!!!!!!! 🤌
Woke and ni**a try too like me
Love how they saved JID for the end, he always spits the hardest on his verses but kid Cudi went off on this one too
If the songs forgettable a dope video won’t be able to saved it.
Bodied.
I think I can confidently say that Denzel is top 5 all time now. I actually don't think he has missed. genuinely. every single one of his albums is a 9/10 bare minimum and he's only getting better over time, especially with his most recent album MMESYF is literally competing with KENDRICK for AOTY.
holy shit this bomb
verse and delivery wise from order it goes to JID Denzel then Cudi but they all fire!!
FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK
Where do you buy cudis all black members of the rage hoody?
Cudi !!!!!
Jid hard
JID definitely made this song good lol no offense to the other legend 🙌
kid cudi too fire
Lil cudi ruined the song
cudis verse jus wasnt it
Which song sounds like the hook?
Brings back Juice J vibes🤔💥
Damn 😯🔥😤
this my song of the summer
https://youtu.be/NMlv21zGARM
Fvvk this is to litt🔥🔥🔥
🔥🔥🔥
This shit is incredible 🤙🏽
Zeltron goes hard af once again 🔥🔥 Awesome to see these boys on a collab.
Anyone else see Denzel curry and cole Bennett and think of that line where Denzel like “fuck cole Bennett”
Da beat vibe is from 2050 😭😭😭🔥🔥🔥
Curry top 5 no cap
This needs AT LEAST 1 million views
🇭🇹😎☝️🔑
😔 If this is dijorno I'd rather have delivery
Slapping! 👌
https://youtu.be/OsA_M4RpDjs
Damn, this beat is spacey yet aggressive.
This song is fucking CRAZYYYY
JID, please. We can’t take it anymore
what supreme hat does cudi have on???? anyone know
fxking ill visuals
the only one who had a good verse was JID pretty mid song
Hook carrys lowkey
💩💩💩💩
omg so bad
This collab was dope on all fronts
heard this song a few times now. just keeps getting better and better
did cudi say "yum" before his verse?
who wanna make a bet that 2k gonna pick this up
Amazing Collab but the beat could've been much better. It's very weak and too random, there's no flow to the song. Just random noises in the background and fast beats. Or maybe i don't get it...
This deserve more views man smh
How Hasn't This Reached A Million Yet ?
mid
Fact that I can rap chorus and 2 first verses but I can't rap J.I.D.'s one is the proof that he could be next to Eminem
Imagine this song is workin' in a group 🤤 everybody did their part in this project
🔥🪐🇧🇷
Is that a Chromatics sample I hear?
Nah this was bad no lie, cmon cudi /:
from 700k🎉❤
Это охуенно!
Curry goes hard af
J.IDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD🔥
Wow
Man i was vibing it on 1.5x without knowing
Dam out of every JID verses' to compare to this one, its a little bit mid but still fire and still feels like best for last honestly.
Kid cudi looks and slounds like old man who decided to be cool.
Dream Team 🔥🔥🔥
how has it got so little views this shit deserves billions tf. Cudi, Denzel and J.I.D this a fucking trifecta
If I don’t see a big artist on Forever story other then Cole I will riot!!!!! Give my man the respectttttt
“Cop a black on black hovercraft that float, or i pull up in a phantom like Kids See Ghosts” 🔥🚀
CUDI FLOW ????

jid just pissed me off. should’ve been longer
🔥🔥🔥
Youtube keeps showing me this garbage music. Even with me disliking every video, telling youtube i'm not interested and asking it not to recommend channel.   Allow me to exclaim why it's Garbage. *They have 100M in the bank and can't tell me how to kill Cancer with sound* . This means, they don't know how sound works to even be making any music.
I never expect this
Ayyyyyyye
🔥
I hope this song blows up, all 4 of them deserve it!!

denzel is good but way to forgetable
❤️❤️❤️ from 🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲
jid carried but it wasnt even good
Denzel Curry should have been on Stick!
Insane collab
In 2012, I almost died from a drug overdose but Jesus Christ saved my life.  During this near death experience, I cried out to the Lord Jesus in prayer and repented to Him for my sins and He saved my life.  Please repent to the Lord Jesus for your sins and then get fully submerged under water as a baptism to God in the name of Jesus and obey what He wants you to do with your life or if you don't do this then when you die you will go to hell.
Finally ppl with the courage to hop Into a track with JID
Song gets a 6.5 out of 10 for me, what about for y’all?

Lowkey they should start a group (atleast for 1 project)
💀💀💀💀🔥🔥🔥
Consider where your soul will spend eternity, heaven or hell.  You don’t want to end up in hell because you rejected the Sacrifice Jesus has made all who repent and turn to him by faith.  We are all guilty of sin.  We lie, steal and look with lust in our hearts.  We are all Guilty before a Holy and Righteous God.  GOD is not just all loving and overlook your sin.  He is loving, but sin He will Judge because He is Perfectly good. The Good news is God the Father sent His Son Jesus Christ who was perfectly Holy to pay the penalty for your and my sin out of Love for us.  We can’t keep the Law we break most all commandments.  But Jesus fulfilled ALL by his perfect thoughts, words, deeds and motives for us because we could not. Jesus loved all humans and God the Father perfectly.  Turn, repent of your sin and confess Your thankfulness for what Jesus did for you.  Put your faith in the perfection and the righteousness of Christ.  Jesus was raised from death to give you new life; death has been defeated. Out of love and grace eternal life is promised to those who have faith.                                                                                           /., /. ,./ , /.               ,./   /.,,/.,/.,/.,

“Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. For the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call.” Acts 2:38-39 KJV   “Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.” John 14:6 KJV   “He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.” John 3:36 KJV   “For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you: But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.” Matthew 6:14-15 KJV  “And I say unto you, Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you. For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened. If a son shall ask bread of any of you that is a father, will he give him a stone? or if he ask a fish, will he for a fish give him a serpent? Or if he shall ask an egg, will he offer him a scorpion? If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children: how much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?” Luke 11:9-13 KJV  “And Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst. But I said unto you, That ye also have seen me, and believe not. All that the Father giveth me shall come to me; and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out. For I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent me. And this is the Father's will which hath sent me, that of all which he hath given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up again at the last day. And this is the will of him that sent me, that every one which seeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have everlasting life: and I will raise him up at the last day.” John 6:35-40 KJV   “And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell. Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your Father. But the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear ye not therefore, ye are of more value than many sparrows.” Matthew 10:28-31 KJV  “Whosoever therefore shall confess me before men, him will I confess also before my Father which is in heaven. But whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I also deny before my Father which is in heaven.” Matthew 10:32-33 KJV   “That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed. For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him. For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.” Romans 10:9-13 KJV   “Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.” John 3:5-6 KJV  “Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son: In whom we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of sins: Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature: For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him: And he is before all things, and by him all things consist. And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the preeminence. For it pleased the Father that in him should all fulness dwell; And, having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things unto himself; by him, I say, whether they be things in earth, or things in heaven.” Colossians 1:13-20 KJV   “Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on the things of others. Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus: Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God: But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men: And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross. Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name: That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth; And that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.”  2 Philippians 2:4-11 KJV   “Take heed that ye do not your alms before men, to be seen of them: otherwise ye have no reward of your Father which is in heaven. Therefore when thou doest thine alms, do not sound a trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have glory of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward. But when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth: That thine alms may be in secret: and thy Father which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly. And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward. But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly. But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking. Be not ye therefore like unto them: for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of, before ye ask him. After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen. For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you: But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses. Moreover when ye fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance: for they disfigure their faces, that they may appear unto men to fast. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward. But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thine head, and wash thy face; That thou appear not unto men to fast, but unto thy Father which is in secret: and thy Father, which seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly. Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal: But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal: For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.” Matthew 6:1-21 KJV

Denzel curry has been doing what he needs to but he was on a freshmen XXL cover with Kodak uzi and 21 savage.  He brought X into the highlight. Not to even mention the raider Klan affiliation and zillakami Denzel curry has one of the most lit live performances. Denzel curry is going down in rap history 2012-2022 era
This is clean this was really unexpected ❤ 🔥 🔥
Denzel is a modern odb?
don’t get to see this cudi much eh
this is shit no cap
Kid Cudi is God

I love zel and cudi but I feel like this song was totally underwhelming
Kid Cudi was having so much in this video 🥺
I'm leaving this comment here so after a month or a year when someone likes it, I get reminded of this song ❤

I love Denzel’s 2Chainz flow. Salute 💪🏽
Like 4 only jid
I love the black and white vibe they used on this song

DREAM BLUNT ROTATION
MASTER☮︎PEACE
Read a bunch of comments hating on Cudi and his career, if you haven't listened to his newer album "Man On The Moon 3: The Chosen" you need to, It's been out for over a year and a half. Dude goes hard as fuck on that album. Call Cudi what you want, I'll call him a a GENIUS dot dot dot.
It's alright
Cudi , Denzel , JID this might be one of the best or if not the best song that dropped this year ong
JID ON LEMONADE WHAT IS HAPPENING
holy moly
They went crazy 🔥
Uhhh, denzel is real..
Uhhh, denzel is real..
Погодите, это реально?
Sorry lyrical this song wasnt it
This reminds me of when I went to see Denzel perform live. Good times.
Only thing that coulda been better was just making it longer, could vibe to this for an hour straight
Song and video of the year

Salvation is found in Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ loves you all
This sounds like a 2k song ngl

The only thing JID lacking to be the 🐐 is time. That man never misses.
Реально пушка

I needed more zel x jid in my life!!! then add cudi (recognizing and uplifting their talents) and dot on production... and you have perfection😍
So much bars for me
The hype that this trio bring is insane
Seven
I needed more JID on this
After we got the bruhh remix with denzel and Jid and this track I’m honestly hoping these two drop a joint project because they are carrying the next gen
Jid. Y you stopped RAPPING !!!
As per Denzel fucking nuked it 💥💥
Dot Da Genius really killed it wit this beat 🔥
The beat fr carry’s this whole song
This is my dream collab

FUUUUUUUUCK I didn't know how I missed Cudder 🤩🤩🤩🤩 Yeeeeeee I'm vibing with his verse - hard
I don't like the beat but still a fire song 🔥
History begin right here!
IM OG 6/24-22
Nope
a ski mask feature on this song would have went crazy, still a fire song🔥
This gives me lil pump vibes
dopeee I saw this with no warning no promo just the thought to browse Cole Bennett page today
Denzels consistency is unmatched. All of his projects and features are classics.
Ayooooo this shhh fire asf

Shit. 💥💥💥💥💥💥💥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

one day I will reach this level of production, and it is a pity that in Brazil the opportunities are scarce, but with focus, one day I will get there, I believe
Goat overload on this one ❗️
Deadly trio
Hold up this is crazy! JID went nuts 🥜
As a film maker I love seeing the edits. I prefer rock music but the editing is just on another level
if you know you know, but wtf you know
Travis Scott should have been on this song I know the transition to cudi to Travis would have sounded good

Haven’t listened to it yet but Ik it gonna be fire

J.I.D's flow is running and laid back at the same time.
🗣️ EVERYBODY ON THE BLOCK TALK ABOUT ME

That first shot of Denzel! So fire ya'll killed it Bennett & team!
Curry's energy never disappoints.

JID did the best
Firrrrreeeeeee 🔥🔥⛽️
Cudi ruined the song
cudi ha solo spaccato
Cudi snapped on this!🔥💯
Jid and denzel on this song is like , kanye and drake on blessings 🤌
I'm so happy JID will finally get the recognition that he deserves
Bro the "headbanger" right before cudi's voice just completely takes me back to A Kid Named Cudi and dot's production style with sampling and everything is perfect. Denzel just gets better and better by each album and song he's in. JID killed it on this feature too and i cant wait to hear more from him
Indicud vibes forsure
Pls more
This a fucking masterpiece
I seriously want to see JID and KAAN on a track 🥵🔥🧯📛

this trio is lethal
Fireee💯🔥
This one song is better than all of Drakes new album
This the most legendary collab I've ever seen 🙌🏾🔥🔥
Man!! JID is just killin' out there
DC has been spitting fire for years now and still isn’t at the top yet. He comes off as cocky to some but to me he’s just confident in his own abilities and knows he’s underrated af. Cudi is a cheat code and can help elevate pretty much any track he jumps on with his melodic style. Cudi’s music has helped me out of some dark times in my life and now I make music to try and offer the same therapy to someone else. I may be small now, but my ultimate goal is to make others feel the way Cudi’s music makes me feel! This collaboration was flawless, and it’s topped off with Dot’s incredible production. He’s one of my inspirations on the production side of my music. I hope y’all collaborate again very soon! 🔥🔥🔥
Had to go shower and do laundry, this song got me feeling too dirty ong
LIKE A SHIT
0:10 in  Like
this one of cudi best verses
🔥🔥🔥
Damn this collab sick
None of that "shot on iphone" bullshit. fuck babytron, fuck yeat, fuck all these bums. Denzel and JID all you need.

This song is the definition of everybody on a group project doing a great job.
the hardest song of the summer has arrived
This collab is like a fantasy team draft

Denzel ft. Everyone else

Okay... I hate streaming.  I just want to buy the music... but I can't buy the music anymore... SMH.   Every media source wants a paid subscription to stream.  What happened to owning music, making my own playlists and not needing Wi-Fi to do it!!??
Something We Didn’t Know We Needed
JID never misssessssss
Other than jid it’s a pass
My idol Frfr when it comes to raping n music jid murdering the rap game
It’s crazy how Cudi can literally slide into any type of music and he does it so effortlessly too 🔥🔥
The collaboration we didn’t expect to make a ass song
I cud live without cudi's verse
Tuff asf
Wow this slapsssss
We need yeat and the minions
I'm the only one that thinks this song is trash 🗑
Yo this go hard!
FYE!🔥

Cudi sounds a little like yung gravy on this song
Cole Bennet Loving 4:3 I see

*отмечаемся под легендарным клипом)*
Kind of a bad song honestly hard ro vibe ro but(my opinion)but cudi kinda carried
Cudi and Denzel carried.
Okay 👍
Fire but not my type of music to jam to
I love the visuals representing each artist’s individual style. Cudi is in a dreamlike environment with multiple versions of himself. Jid is in an exotic place with loads of explosive colour. And Zel just keep on walkin’.
Dot da Genius and Kid Cudi. Twas lit.🔥🔥🔥
ive been waiting for Denzel to come on Lyrical lemonade for so long
Something that only cole can do, this is amazing. Curry was definitely my favorite in this
Slamming ts from now on
J.I.D 🥵🔥

Denzel carried
This is fire 🔥
History!
Jid underrated
