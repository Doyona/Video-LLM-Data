Madonna is the queen of pop cunters
I miss UNHHHHHHH so much, maybe just holidays specials, not a whole season ..
This is what mental illness looks like.
holy shit i hadn't thought abt that anti gay psa for YEARS
I love yous, however its gen x that started with computers. I was in 5th grade when we started having computer class in CA. It was so basic, no dial up. ❤
what trixie said about phone and smoking SOOOO REALLLL
What you doing there Meredith Grey
" 5:25 Smart bulbs gradually come on in the morning" that's called the SUN RISE. ( she does look like Goldie Hawn)
0:21 literally looked up the gathering storm PSA.. came across the parody, "the gaythering storm"  lol.
I prefer a desktop because I’m totally incompetent with my thumbs.
1:19 being r/contact fans is killing me
3:53 can confirm. I remember in high this girl and guy got caught doing it in the bathroom
Katherine has been interrupted so much that she has resorted to abusing Patricia
dead dad on the beach is an extra hun
Trixie being shocked by the gays of old. LOL. 😊❤
8:18 etsy as a gay app!!! I'm hollering! 😊❤
PHOMPUTER. Also, its a millenial thing to enjoy computers. I only do important purchases on the computer. The phone IS NOT safe.
why are...the swears bleeped
THE GREEN MILE?!?
This episode is very underrated, it is never mentioned I feel, but it’s one of my absolute favorites!
Katya is doing the most
SUDDENLY SALAD 😭😭😭
It’s the wig the Caleb rejected
Trixie = Totally Hair Barbie
“Ugh. I look so pretty today.”  “YOU DOOOOO! And I wanna go home.” 😂😂😂
🖤
The editors never cease to amaze me 😂👏👏👏🙌
katya thinking she's a millenial
Who remembers Borders book store?? You're old like me if u do lol
To be fair a lot of us girls were being groomed by older men online too so 😩
Gurlll, watching this drunk af on new years 2025 where are these godesses rn 😭
My lungs escaped at "Goldie Hawn with the Swarm of Bees" 😭😭😭😭😭

This editor is a gd genius
Suddenly salad
The way that Trixie looks at Katya at 9:51 ☺️
I am Katya in this video... The WHEEZING!!
10:57 Wisco accent alert  sAHn dee-A-goh
10:56 Wisco sAHn dee-A-go
The blackberry and sidekick was the phomputer
Katya insisting on being a millenial is GOLD
Not Suddenly Seymour 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
RUG MUNCH HIGH SCHOOL
We’re having weather~
I feel called out because I’m smoking a joint and watching this on my phone because I only need one hand 😂 Katyaaaa
trixies just getting beaten and abused while katya tries breathe through her laughing fits the entire episode
6:50 Katya’s look of true confusion sends me every time
Do you think Abraham Lincoln would've been shot, if he had a computer?!? 😮🤔🎉
The funniest part of this was katya thinking she was a millennial ❤
Trixie’s Totally Hair Barbie dress is AMAZING
They both look so good: it's scandalous!
How dare these biological female women have a show where they get paid to act promiscuous and laugh wheeze  for 20 minutes straight while I am stuck running a housekeeping business.
2:39 So glad to see Katya reprising her role as Bjork.
ive seen queer as folk
“I’m from Hong Kong” “your English is very good” they were a colony up until 2 days ago like..
Yes!! The giant gay repellent umbrella starring the one and only Jane lynch unhhhh
Editors, I also agree that Carmen Sandiago is a lesbian
Trixie looks amazing in this look
4:35 5:11
Suddenly salad!
6:46
4:37 The music and editing is soo unhinged 😂
OMG WTF NO WAY U MENTIONED HONG KOGN ILEV HEER
Dr Jill Biden is neither a Dr nor has she ever been a teacher.  That whole family is filled with liars, drug addicts, and ppl who've never done anything for the ppl they serve.
Katya looks so beautiful and Trixie's nails look... odd
4:07 When no one was yelling 😂
The delusion is glorious
I've watched this I think more than 25 or 30 times now. This episode now rivals "WEATHER" as my favorite episode of all time.
Im cackling through this episode
it’s suddenly salad….
Pwtts : Pennies mean Blood.
Katyas age shows so much in this episode. She's just dripping with boomer energy. Bitch is impressed by a damn printer.
i fuckin love that dial-up noise katya makes at 2:36
10:23 *fresh stack o' book right in my hand.......*
I am watching in bed trying not to laugh loudly as my hubs is trying to sleep. I shall try to use Katya’s wake up face at least twice a day.
Obsessed with Trixie wearing my favorite Barbie dress.
I watch these women when I need to distract myself from thinking about men that gave me the ick.
These two should be in drag real life real estate agents.
Katyas "Ohhh the LIGHT BULBS!!!"  *smack 😂😂  i love her energy, in this episode
Katya chose violence in this episode, like literally
The Desk top/vers/bottom killed me 😂 very creative 😂
"Truth or dare?" **doesn't wait for a response** "Do you ever suck 🐓 in drag?"
Trixie was so irritated this day lol
Psa if you’re dry masturbating…your dick head becomes more rough..use lube.
Katya is sort of kind of giving the red-neck and blue CONTACT dress in Space to me, personally
Etsy.. 😂😂
Tritcy is being man handled by Katya in this episode haha
gettin cornholed @ the barns and nobles!
Nobody's talking about Katya's Emperor of Russia slippers😮😂
Just came from I Like To Watch Grace & Frankie and I finally understand Jennifer Nightingale for all your real estate needs😭
Trixies hair looks great!
I feel I speak on behalf of the people who watch these on a religious basis, we need a Katya slap count for every single video😭
Im sorry but if you didnt have an omegal phase with just a bunch of dicks popping up on the screen when youre in elem/middle school did you even have a childhood?
katya's dry little acorn ooh yeah
I hear that if you play this episode without sound, it tells a tragic tale of spousal abuse that ends in horror.
Katya literally just BEATING Trixie up in this episode and we're supposed to sit here and WATCH?  Cause I am, I'm watching.
i've never truly hated something katya did or said with my entire being but that dial up noise that she does at 2:40 makes me wish i lived at the bottom of the ocean
Straight up asl lmfao those were the times
I've noticed in these videos trixie often repeats the topic, as if to wrangle everything back in
Katya looks very manly here
Gay bars started really getting away with being gay bars during the dry era. When alcohol was outlawed. Because the dumb cops didnt know as much about gay people. And they were more interested in speak easys that were easker to catch whichnwas the straight ones. In my imagination when i think gay speak easy probably drank everything in a coffee cup. But like the modern big ones and when people came in that were straight they pretended it was a coffee shop. And everyonebhad to uncross their legs and sit back in their chairs instead of leaning towards each other with their bent wrists. Lol. I did hear that when speak easies started be oming a thing was when vay people started being able to hide even easier.
The dry rub hand puppets with light sabers and everything else just.... fkn kills me. When she says "i grab it at the base and i fling it around" i laugh so hard it makes my eyes water.
These outfits are giving ✨going back to your roots✨
Totally Hair Trixie.
Trixie looks incredible! But do you remember computers WITHOUT internet??
I love katias asthma attacks XD
I’m rewatching this episode for the 800th time simply because I love the honking when Katya slaps Trixie’s knee after Trixie reads Katya for  🚬🫲🏻🫱🏻📱
"My computer is already on because I'm talking to you" sent me to another dimension and back 😂
Tracy is serving the fiercest Totally Hair Barbie look in this one, i hope she makes it in the sequel
I wonder if Trixie gets annoyed by Katya's habit of hitting her when she laughs 😂
Suddenly salad was a goat response 😂
Is Trixie going for the reincarnation of Gem?
I wonder if Trixie ever wakes up like 🤜💫🕊😵‍💫🕊💫🤛
DEAD DAD ON THE BEACH AHAHA
Katia wheezing her way through this and abusing Trixies leg 😂
they both look so good in this episode
Trixie looks amazing
Fast forward and katya is doing home electrolysis
Suddenly Salad!
Now that we have computers; it's too late to imagine not having computers. Yeah I melt into fade with my Cannibis and computers.
I didn't think being queer or straight was a choice? Well I am not responsible for people being so simple minded about us queers.
People always look at me with this disapproving, knowing stare, because I can use a computer mouse both left and right handed with no problems.....  LOL! It's whatever hand I reach forward with LOL!
"I won't laugh" "I love to learn" **W H E E Z E**
I’m literally Katya repeating the one thing that only made ME laugh, over and over again 😂
This is one of my favorite looks from Trixie
5:07 OMG TRIXIES FACE‼️🤣 Love it 💖
Katya looks and acts so incredibly blasted and same
These two guys somehow are more masculine than those soy boy simps. You remind me of rock stars from the 80's.
The editing in this episode should win all the prizes. We're talking Emmys, Grammys, Nobellys. It just sings!
is it just me or does katya seem more into this ep than trixie? probably just a one off but it kind of feels like katya is trying to overcompensate or uplift trixie’s mood in this episode more than usual, just an observation lol let me know if you feel the same
Katya was excessively touchy this ep it make me unease
Why do i feel like im watching an episode of Scorpion 😅🎉 Oh, its the dial-up sound  thing A bunch of nerds wandering around in the wield looking for a best buy to replace their astro-glide caked keyboards. And they love to lern 😮🙃
OHHHH THE LIGHTBULBS *smacks Trixie* 😂
Totally hair Barbie dress!
I'm so used to them being women that whenever they talk about their penises my brain goes 😵 like what is life?
Normally Katya just beats herself up laughing, but s/o to Trixie for all the hits she took this episode too 😂🤞
The amount of slaps Trixie received this episode. I bet she was slightly annoyed 😂
Trixie perfectly describing hyperfixation had me ded gurl just admit you’ve got ADHD already
The computer did a lot for me as a gay person. My sister liked to watch viral YouTube videos and one of them was like a parody video of a powerade commercial called gay powerade. That was the straw that broke the camel's back because I then went on my computer and watched/jerked-off to gay porn for the first time all night. And that is how I found out I was gay. 😅😅
The first generation to not have computers?! Ma’am. Gen X would like a word.
THE TRIXIE DOLL HAHAH
great thigh slapping this episode
In my moments of self-reflection, I worried that the path I trod was causing me to grow colder and unkind. Such a transformation would have been anathema to my core principles of grace and kindness. Yet, with clarity, I now understand that I have not forsaken these values; instead, I have begun to recognize the importance of valuing my time and establishing boundaries.  In a delightful twist, my workplace has embraced an event known as "Smut Slam." I attended the previous gathering, a soirée of sex-positive storytelling that evoked laughter and camaraderie. You need not feel compelled to partake in the festivities, as I, too, refrained on my prior visit. The forthcoming event is scheduled for the 27th, and should you find yourself unoccupied and curious, a ticket shall be procured for your attendance.  As I reflect upon our mornings together, they occupy a cherished place within my heart. The simplicity of rolling over to bestow affection and sharing a quiet moment over tea is nothing short of blissful. Your kindness and grace are notes of a harmonious melody that I hold dear.  In you, Dylan, I see a man of remarkable character and substance. The serendipity of our encounter is not lost upon me, and I am acutely aware of the rare privilege it is to have you in my life. Permit me to conclude by sharing that you inspire me. You are a beacon of light that illuminates the path towards self-improvement and authenticity. Your presence in my life has gifted me invaluable lessons, and for that, I am profoundly grateful.  I send this letter with the fervent hope that it finds you in high spirits and good health, eagerly anticipating our next shared moment.  Yours sincerely,
Dry rub all the way.
Trixie with the authority of a learned scholar: "I read a tweet recently "
That's the advantage with today's technology; we are having the blessing of turning into ghost writers.🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉😅😊
I'm not smoking, and I don't like the phone peter 😮
"Sometimes my ear rings when people around me look horrible." -Trixie Mattel 2023
Its giving Skipper and im here for it
Trixie looks GORGEOUS... 😱😱
Katya i absolutely wake up like that😂😂😂😂😂😂
The two of you are so over filled with confidence, that I wish I could have your spillage! You two ladies are terrific.
the looks are serving. i'm gagged. love you xx
Not Trixie looking like my favorite Barbie ever 🤩🤩🤩
I love them❤❤❤
Katya sounds high asf. Inspiring. This is the job i want.
It’s amazing after dating a Jewish man for years, Trixie still doesn’t know cut men need lubrication
It’s the way Trixie is describing adhd for me
I just cannot agree, just because you can use a computer does not mean you understand how it actually works and what to do when you want to try to figure out a new process or build a program.  Smart people are smart people in any age, and I dont think this age is any smarter or dumber than any other.  That's like saying musicians today are better than those of the past, the music of today is different and perhaps is better to your ears, but once you listen to the breadth of all music you discover that music in all ages was intricate and created by artists in all eras.  This is the same with technologies.
OMG I FORGOT AGE SEX LOCATION WAS A THING!!!
I can f up some bacon ranch Suddenly Salad. That crap is amazing.
The sound effects in this episode were UNHINGED
I love to learn 💋💁🏻‍♂️
Katya... baby sweetie honey, you're Gen X
That non-smoker to working on G pipeline sure is fast
90% of this episode was wheezing and slapping 😭😭😭😭😭 love her so much
“whatever else” and they put etsy omg 😭😭😭
i love that katya committed to the wake up bit
4:30 the world is truly divided I didn’t start with lube and now it just feels weird
Mama Ru: "Drag is not a contact sport."  Katya:
I need to wake up like Katya more often.
beautiful mother daughter duo
I think Katya should have another career doing sound effects.
Hi bald
I just want to see how many bruises Trixie has on her legs from Katya’s wheezing/slapping fits ☠️😂♥️
"I'm not gonna laugh", a nanosecond later WHEEEEEEEEEEZE
Oh my god Trixie's look in this is so cuteeeee
I love you two SO MUCH! I laugh so hard watching these. If you're ever in Plymouth MA let's get drinks!
this is hands down my favourite uhnhh episode
Katya wears the hell outta that fringe 🙌
guys im a huge fan of this show, but the editing is so in my face i cant really enjoy the dynamic duo anymore!! Tone it down, Mary!
As good as computers are, the drama of reading a physical book does it for me.
The goddamn sound effects every time Katya touches Trixie.. IN EVER EPISODE.. SENDS ME INTO ORBIT. I’m weak with laughter. Dying. 🤣👏
“my computer is already on..” 🤣🤣🤣
5 minutes into thw video and i am already 6ft under wtf 😂😂😂😂 WHEN EVER THEY BECOME EQUALLY UNHINGED IN AN EPISODE-  ITS ICONIC 💀🤣🤣🤣
"if that's impressive to you, the cellphone is gonna blow your mind!'
"The interspecies mingling"
Katya waking up was HILARIOUS
"DONT YELL AT ME"
When Hillary and Bill Clinton's were playing video games I fell out my chair. This is my favorite wig of trixies. Since the first time i saw it i loved it. Reminds me of my hair Every time i think of katya smoking i think of her saying that....omg something about little people leading little lives and shes thrilled. I cant remember the exact words.
fourty years of hiths?
I’m living for this look on Trixie. She’s everything I wish I was
Sutton Lee Salad
The Green mile is back 😭
Suddenly Salad 😭
Damn Trixie looks so good this episode
What until they talk about chatGPT 😂
Do body count video
This is my favorite Trixie thus far.
Geewiz
I laughed so hard at this tonight!!!!! I was wheezing right along with Katya! 😂😂😂
a storm is cumming lol
I really don't understand the need to censor "jerk off"...
the editing is phenomenal 5:12-5:19 THE WAY THE BIRDS DISAPPEAR THEN REAPPEAR LMAO
6:45 I love that her explanation is that it’s because Katya’s a smoker and _not_ because she’s 7 years older than her and thus more accustomed to the phone and computer being separate.
So how many bruises does TRIXIE have on her legs this season LOL??😁
jen from jen and the holograms x taylor swift collab
What the he%& is up with Katya today?!?
The way Katya just screams “AAAAHHH LIGHTBULBS!” and then just smacks Trixie’s knee just sent me. 😂😂😂
i smoke at the pc and let it sit when the queue pops, cant stand a phone lmao.
Ah yes, being the first generation to have internet access at a young age meant: -decapitation videos in 3rd grade  -pedos grooming me  -emo catfishes -role playing/fanfics -so much porn -so many pedos I really gotta say that twice. Dicks in my inbox when im 11 -sooo much gore  -bullied to hell and back bc nothing could be done abt it back then (Born in '99)
katya does not seem the most sober and trixie is not having it
can you swear in comments ? let's see: fuck
5:45 So unhinged 😂
Omg that MacBook!!! ❤
See this is where Katya and I disagree. I would have killed to be a street walker. Ironically enough I would have prob also be actually killed but hey, computers 🎉
So Trixie ABSOLUTELY has ADHD. Also - Katya's SHOES - I LOVE!!! <3
Hi @WOWpresents! Ya’ll should do an episode about cheaters! Please please pleeeeeeease lol
5:32 I swear I wake up like that too Katya... 😂
The episodes stopped being funny for over a year 😞💛 where is the old fun
Love you two but the first gen to grow up with computers was Gen X. AKA the forgotten generation.
It’s so wild how not only do we DO have calculators with us all the time but that I on a daily basis from 15 feet away say “Hey Siri, What’s 13 percent of 200?” Or “Hey Siri, what’s 8 once’s of sugar in grams?” (I’m a baker btw haha)
The amount of times katya hit Trixie in this video 💀
'You've got mail' - rpdr early seasons
Love y'all both so much😘 💜 My son does drag and goes to school... He's  almost 18 in November! I'm the only one supporting him! I love him so much but I'm scared for him! Only because a few guys said they would beat his ass and do horrible things to him! I went to the school and raised hell! And when he gets of the bus he doesn't know but I watch him like a crazy psycho....   Could you do a podcast on that kinda situation ect. XO💜
Trixie looks like Totally Hair Barbie!!!
"I love to learn" 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 I'm with Katya
Do cheating next 🥹
I bleach my roots and lift them, I changed a spare & inflated a flat that I rode over a nail on, because I ride in the gutter to give space to ppl like Japanese custom(s) 🙏🏼
The green mile!!
emancipate me daddy
BUWAHAHAHA 🤣🤪🦝👽🤪🤣
5:07 Let the transformation begin! We now ascend to a higher form of human functioning
The "Emancipate Me Daddy!" sticker on the Abe Lincoln laptop is WILD💀
Trinanda's hair so big
Trixies thigh🖤💙
Santa as an old man on the computer: creepy presence. Nice but naughty!
That dial up impersonation was giving Bjork
please talk about male gold diggers!!!
Omg I love Suddenly Salad 😅
Take a shot every time they say computer 🖥️
Suddenly salad, her laugh..I'm dead 😂
Ummm it wasn't that funny Katya chill girl
Charlize is from Africa and she's WHITE!!
Oooh as a baby millennial (1995) I feel like trixie is 100% millennial but katya maybe be gen X??
trixie and katya's relationship development can be explained by katya beginning to, instead of slapping her own leg when something's funny, slap trixie's.
Tracy and Katie is exactly what my day needed.
You forgot gaming Krusty Krab
suddenly salad <3 i remember " rly right in front my salad" hahaha
My Alexa's wake word is "Computer" and this episode was a trip...
Wowpresents y’all are CLOWNS for not putting the unhhh playlist on the TOP of your playlists. Wtf do u think we’re here for
As a sheltered cis female too embarassed to talk to boys in person as a kid, I too was a victim to the old men on the internet lol.
Do you want to cyber?
i love that katya is always bored/tired at the most interesting topics
Kenzie loves u guys
I’ve never seen Katya hit Trixie so many times in one episode 😂😂
5:57, desk verse desk bottom 💀
My 5th grade teacher was in that anti-gay marriage gathering storm ad 😬 She took a few days off and told us she was filming a commercial, I only figured out what that commercial was for years later
Trixie: "I love to learn."  Katya: *wHeEeezE"
Love the total hair Barbie dress!
trixie had katya dying this ep 😭😭😭😂😂
Trixie is so funny. Giving comedy straight man realness
Katya wheezing has taken full control
All credit to Bread Pitt and Ghoulia Roberts but what would the show be without the editing team? Thank you so much to them. 💓🎉
I mean I might be a little too high but 5:00 with the editing moment of smart bulbs had me dying
Katya decided to be taylor swift this episode
lol
Wow this was a good one 😂😂😂😂😂
Awesome to see Trixie sporting some sweet Teddy Fresh gear!!
did they just say fagg*t twice without censors??? but the can't say fuck or pussy or cunt? daaaaamn
6:59 😂😂😂
This was a fun episode
I just saw the barbie movie today and am currently living for totally hair trixie!
This harkens back to the Katya of years back. I'm getting concerned. 😮
Trixie looks sooo gorgeous here
Katya's Street Menu... whoever did that, I love you and thank you for your service.
The Jeffree Star wig! That was the first time I saw Trixie
i also did a lot i shouldn’t be doing but in fandom and fanfic (i started reading it at 11 lol)
Were the red lanterns and stereotypical “Chinese” music really necessary 😭😭😭 Hong Kong’s quite literally one of the most Westernized cities in Asia
I was waiting for Suddenly Salad
But seriously. Old men in chat rooms.
Good work Ron
Ok. Suddenly Salad killed me 😂😂
"You jerk off with lube?" "Yeah, am I supposed to just do it dry?????" "Thats what I do" Well I guess now we know which of them is cut and which is uncut huh 💀💀💀💀
This Totally Hair Barbie dress is everything!!!
The animations in this episode were too good lmao!
Y’all not on WOW plus are missing out on “…should we kiss?” lmfao
“i look so pretty” “& i wanna go home” felt 👹💅🏻
Katya wheeze laugh get better and better each week 😂😂😂
Katya's shoes are giving Gemstone Fantasy!
Katyas wheeze just sounds like when you trying to start your car engine 😂
RIP to Trixie's thighs this episode 😂😂😂
Katya was onto something with "and computers will divide us" with the rise of AI 🥴
David blow up doll ball gagged with clothespins as nipple clamps took me OUT 😂
shoutout for that grace & frankie reference 🤍
A) "illuminati on line" was f.ckin great B) love the 'misfits'(Jem) vibe Trixie Is giving 😅
ooooOOOOOOHHHH THE LIGHTBULBS!   *smacks leg with excitement*   😂😂😂 most katya shit ever
Katya was particularly unhinged this episode, her smoker's wheeze made up half her dialogue 😅
do a gaming episode on my knees
Trixie's hair and outfit is giving jem and the holograms
Sometimes I forget they have penises.
RUG MUNCH HIGH SCHOOL!!!!!  😂😂😂😂😅😅I'm gagged!!!!  Who is the editor??
I ONCE SPOKE TO AN OLDER GUY WHEN I WAS 15 WHO PRETENDED TO HAVE NO LEGS WITH A SOLDIERS PICTURES TO GUILT ME INTO SENDING PICTURES …
The Goldie Hawn waking up thing killed me
1782?
TOTALLY HAIR TRIXIE ❤ I love her Totally Hair Barbie look so much!
Editor-san had a lot of fun with this episode.
me fucking watching this with my phone on one hand and a cigarette on the other 7:28
And just like that... you wear my favorite barbie outfit everrrrr. Vriendin
Like an ACORN??????
The editing is so god tier lol
My kittee is ded
I LOL'd so hard as a senior citizen from Katya's generation. & thanks for the Hong Kong shout out. 🎉
1792
lovvvvvvve this wig Trixie. With the fit and everyth it's giving Barbie's giant blow out party. That's some upgrade from the local grandma vibe you generally go for😭
The fucking editing in this one oh 👏 my 👏 god 👏
Katya really beating the sh*t out of Trixie's leg this episode lmfao
They need an episode of childhood toys. Mainly cause I'd like to see Katya dressed as weird barbie
Welcome to the stage Compute HER 🎉
No Clarissa explains it all reference? Missed opportunity. 🙂
Katya: "Computers will DIVID- oh"
The guy who invented computers was also a homosexual. Alan Turing
gotta shoutout the editors again. we all know they’re great but they’re making me laugh extra hard today. 8:12 took me OUT I had to pause. 9:21 9:23 yall too much
10:00 Not in front of my salad 😭
Can I have some Katya?
If the would have put Trixie in the Barbie movie, not only would it have completed the BRAND, they would have also solved the little issue of not having a single of my native sisters represented, except in a shitty little throw away joke about smallpox.
i look so pretty today  you too
My "You've Got Mail" was voiced by Sarah Jessica Parker.
Trixie looks amazing
My favourite episodes are when Katya is slightly manic and Trixie leaves with bruises on her legs and arms from all the slapping.
The editing of this episode is *FRAN*TIC* 😂
Hi, Katya! I wake up like that, you are not alone.
Step 1) pause to read Katya's Street Menu  Step 2) see the last line Step 3) laugh so hard you die
Hahaha whenever Katya slaps Tricia and she yells, “OW!” Sent me. For some reason. Ahahaha! 🤣
Uh Oh.........
Who let Katya go out with that white ass face not even matching the neck I -
Trixie dressed as totally hair Barbie is so iconic 😍
11:18 The “emancipate me daddy” sticker was such a clever touch 😂😭😭
The way I always talk about how underutilized google and researching information is in todays world. We want to be spoon fed the most basic and often wrong or biased information, it’s wild to me how many choose ignorance or don’t get random questions they want to answer daily.
Katya pointing at herself as a Milennial is such a mood her being Generation X
The incredibly terrible Australian accents will always be my fave, cos what the fishing fudge is our (Melbourne) accent anyway?
ladies and gentlemen, please welcome to the stage: 😦Suddenly Salad🥗 9:44
These men need help.  Fast
Trixie and I were in the same mood during this one. Just fucking over it. She must be on her period too.
i'm drunk
I'm still that gay out in the wild picking up men in the real world left and right .
So, so, so much touching and slapping this episode!
She’s Totally Hair Barbie….😢
Sutton Lee Salad 😂
Omg Trixie is Totally Hair Barbie right now!
Tricia not making a single cameo in the Barbie movie is the most homophobic crime to occur in recent years, Big like 👌👌🙏🙏, The way you do the work gracefully - I am very proud of you. Thanks for going through the trouble and it's worth it.  I’ve never witnessed such awesome editing as this one. You have the absolute power to rise above any situation or struggle and transform yourself into the strongest and most beautiful version of yourself ever. The secret to happiness is doing what you love and learning to love what you have to do to get it. Congratulations and best of luck for your promising future. Keep doing the best work. Great job, you are amazing, you are important, you are special, you are unique, and you are valuable! Never give up, go ahead, fight for your dreams, everything will get better for you, I wish you good luck. I truly love your channel. You have my full supportt.
4:37 Katya rubbing that dry voodoo doll I can't- ! 😭😭🤣
Katya's dial-up verging eerily into her Bjork.
Trixie is the barbie you get when you make your barbies Sc!szor too much
Why is Katya wearing a mature wig like that?! 😂😂😂
Idk if someone has pointed out but it’d be much handier if the white background was replaced bcuz i’m watching it in bed and it’s too bright.
They speak English in Hong Kong and I’m shocked Tricia doesn’t know that
"It's Suddenly Salad" OMG THAT HAD ME ROLLIN' From Wisconsin and JUST had it last night for the first time in years!
Literally that ASL (A/S/L) haunts me 😂
Katya is on fire on This! Bomb 🤯🤯🤯😵‍💫😵‍💫😵‍💫🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 the “you don’t wake up like This?!” Is the new “and That’s how a knew I was falling in love” loosing it lol❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
I remember that PSA
trixi is leaving set this week bruised and battered
y’all are on another level in this one 💀
PC4PC
Teachers back in the day: you’re not gonna have a calculator on you everywhere you go! You need to memorize these equations!”  Me: Look at me now, bissssh!! Calculating and shit!!
With all this talk of gay computer activities I was waiting for them to get into the fact that the computer was invented by a homosexual💅🏼
Trixie looks SO good it's unreal
Lemon love that look queen
Dear Jeff and Ron, Steve Jobs did NOT invent the computer xP
Pause at 11:40 🤣
Suddenly salad is the same as dial-up. I will not be saying more.
Katya really said you aint interrupting me today😂💀
2:22 Sorry Ms Martel, thats categorically untrue. Gen X-ers actually were the first generation to have access to computers growing up. We literally had classrooms full of computers lol 🤣
Im watching this on my phone while smoking a joint looking exactly like Trixie does at 6:52 tho it’s not a ciggy, I still feel offended.
Carmen San Diego ....at home 😁
B.Dalton 🤣
The editing on this episode is SUPERB. Jeff and Ron you deserve multiple Emmys
Censoring j/o but not the f slur is so funny lmaoo
4:36 the editing is tickling meeeee
Do you think Linclin would of been shot if he had a computer?
Katya nodding solemnly and saying “f*ggotry” made me pee my pants
the stereotypical "chinese" music and the photo of the lanterns at 3:15 is CRAZYYY!! love but think about how that may be a little fucked up
PHD in faggotry -Jeffree Star  I love you guys XD You genuinely crack me up.
Does Cannibis smoking count. I get lots of practice texting with relentless comments I make to you.😅
Trixie is serving Dep Barbie and I am loving it
Trixie casually forgetting gen x exists
missed a valuable and once in a lifetime opportunity to have the topic of this video be azealia banks
Matthew 12 43 When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through dry places, seeking rest, and findeth none.  44 Then he saith, I will return into my house from whence I came out; and when he is come, he findeth it empty, swept, and garnished.  45 Then goeth he, and taketh with himself seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and they enter in and dwell there: and the last state of that man is worse than the first. Even so shall it be also unto this wicked generation.
Trixie revealing her uncut privilege
I feel sorry for Trixie's leg this episode, that got some serious spanking action from Katya.
😂👎
Katya’s aol “WELCOME” was so on point I thought it was a sound bite added in post.   Half of times I would log on to aol via dial up back in the day was to secretly browse naughty sites when my parents would be out of the house. Ngl Katya’s impression gave my inner 13yr old an anticipatory half chub.   Hmmm… that sounded —eh whatever I’m gonna leave it.
11:42 "yeah faggotry"
Early Beta woes
Every episode Trixie's hair grows by 20cm. If allowed to continue, it will be able to swallow Katya whole by 2024.
best episode since weather ✨✨✨
I seriously love this look for Trixie, it's one of my favorites that she rocks
💜💙❤️💛💚
11:22
9:44
Wait isn't Katya trying to quit smoking rn is that what this energy is about 😭
Totally hot, totally cool, totally hair Tracy
It took Katya so long to get the smoking thing lmao
I’m not SMOKIN bitch
8:35, 😆
8:14, 😆
Trixie conveniently forgetting GenX exists...  😭
3:21, expath?

#19 on trending
11:10
This whole episode is just Katya beating tf outta Trixie 😂😂
I feel like we got to experience Katya on some kind of substance in this episode. Someone lmk what substance it would be 👇
Trixie looks amazing. I think my favorite look ever 🫢
Omg Totally Hair Trixie (Barbie)!!!!! ❤❤❤❤
Who the hell watches these disgusting monsters
Wig.
this is my first time watching, does the one on the right always attack the one on the left like that? hands all over, slapping, clawing, etc
Katya beat the crap out of Trixie’s leg 😂😂😂
Suddenly sea side
This episode was too good
**unexpectedly hot abraham lincoln alert*
Trixie looks like she’s about to get loose 😂
Trixie + Katya = 445.5?
I don’t say this often but trixie looks great here
A+++ to the graphic guys!! Love gals
🤮🤮🤮🤮
This whole video is katya being violent to trixie
I think this is the first time I’ve seen them stay relatively on topic for the majority of the episode…..
SUDDENLY SALAD 😂
Isn't Katya Gen X?
trixie's fucking phone tirade as katya is dying gave me so much fucking life
it's that show 2 of you talk about whatever you 2 want. It's your show, and not mine
This is the hunger games in real life. So sad
Girl not the American version of Queer as Folk... give RTD his flowers
Trixie's leg is fully bruised after this one. Love.
I mean some of us have learning disabilities and that's why we do talk to text... 😅 Do be calling me a ma ma
deskTop, deskVers, deskBtm is the funniest thing I’ve seen on UNHhhh😂
I would kill to see a episode called makeup and they get into drag
I love these two but ya gotta admit the editing is brilliant!
Trixie is dressed like Jem!
For some reason I feel like katya is giving Taylor swift in this episode.
I think these two are the only thing on the face of internet that can actually hold my attention for more than 10 min straight
Loved this episode
that “what?” at 0:14 is Hilarious 😂
Trixe is too quick with her jokes. It's almsot inhuman😂
That Totally Hair Barbie dress on Tracy... 💜💙🩵💛💛🧡💚🩷❤️💙
I feel like Trixie is pissed this ep
So glad there are no computers in the sane town of Chillingbourne. ⛔⛔⛔
Uh hi...GEN X here...everyone forgets about the generation in between Boomers and everyone else and we hate you all lol. We were teens when the internet came out. 😎
Trixie is right though, getting texts on my computer was a major contributing factor towards me buying my Macbook. It's the best feature ever.
Everytime Katya hit Trixie, I drnk, now I am drnk
Trixie; “And you don’t do that”  Katya; “NoOooOo”
7:00
All of trixies jokes are “MY life is so unique and Katya is an idiot”
I love that I can copy something on my phone and past it on my computer or vice versa. Technology is wonderful lol
This is disgusting
This is the funniest episode in a long time. The graphics are A+
Katya making that dial-up tone, I need that to be the ringtone for my alarmclock 😜
Trixie I know exactly what tf you are talking about those were real videos 💀
The way I lost it when I said “suddenly salad” and then 13 seconds later Trixie said “suddenly salad”.
Okay but the totally hair Barbie outfit 😍😍
I laughed out loud at Phomputer
showing this video to people in the late 1800s when i time travel they’re gonna flip
IT WAS THE RAGNAROK BACKGROUND SOUNDTRACK FOR ME
OMGGGG TRACEY!!! I HAD THAT BARBIE!!!!!  You look JUST like her!  🩷🤍🩵💜🩷🤍🩵💜
"I wrote all my books but it was voice to text." LITERALLY HOW IM SURVIVING COLLEGEEEEEE heh. Sns
7:00 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Hello, Totally Hair Barbie???? 💖💖💖
Had to rewind and make sure Trixie did in fact say f***** information.
The precious moment of Abraham Lincoln at home with his man. Loved that
Katya ate this one😅
amazing!
Katya was SO high omfg 💀💀
I'm 5 seconds in and I had to stop it to comment how AMAZING that Totally Hair Barbie look on Trixie is! I loved that doll so much, I need details on the dress ASAP
trixie looks so good this ep
with the amount of touching in this ep certain shippers will rise from the ashes
Katya was really touch starved today
isn't Katya gen x? 😂
Hello, it's Katya's doctor here. I analysed the contents of this video and I am called to expand on the events of minute 06:50. Katya almost experienced being seen by Trixie, which got my client ecstatic. She was yearning to further explore the observation Trixie had just made about the relation between smoking and the aversion towards the phemonenon of 'phomputers'. Trixie stated that Katya doesn't like the 'interspecies' merging of phones with computer because of her smoking habit. Katya felt seen and wanted to know more, as this is true, albeit not for the reason Trixie moved on to explain.   Having had Miss Zamolodchikova (yes, I've had to google her name as it triggers my insecurity around spelling) under my care for many years, I can testify that yes, Yekaterina doesn't love using her mobile phone as a computer because she enjoys smoking while holding her device, which makes it hard to compute in a manner that one would expect from a computer user. She does enjoy the computer and she is skilled at it in her own creative way. She does not enjoy answering e-mails from her phone as to do so effectively she would need both hands and truthfully, chances are that she is smoking a cigarette while browsing the internet on her mobile.   Props to Trixie for being on the right track. Me, myself, I enjoy analysing Katya from my small office in the asylum I reside in. Big love and thank you for the joy of watching such an earnest moment. The 'almost understandings' that are necessary between friends and within ourselves are some of the most beautiful things - I wouldn't be surprised if I missed the mark on the truth of the matter, as Katya's habits are so varied and in consistent change - I wouldn't be surprised if in reality my analysis were to turn out completely false. All the best
Def talking to old men on the internet when I wad a baby gay at 15 yrs old
Have an episode on conspiracies 🤡
The “hand free” to smoke while on the internet with your phone in other hand thing was also very… enlightening to me. I honestly hadn’t even thought of that being why I prefer just an iPhone. My partner tried to get me a tablet once… pfff I need nicotine with my screen stimulation double dopamine d1ldofication
Katya: is it Suddenly Seymour or Suddenly Susan Trixie: its Suddenly Salad Katya: wheezes Trixie: ITS SUDDENLY SALAD BITCH
The amount Katya is getting physical in this one, and the looks of “get it off me” from trixie are everything.
These are some of the loneliest ppl on the planet whose only comforts are materials and glamour.
Yass Trixies totally hair Barbie look
Never been so early
boring episode
I was talking to a friend who is 30 (im 35) and she is too young to remember when amazon just sold used books. It *is* kinda interesting to have grown up while the internet was developing..
I love Trixie reading Katya for her smoking
Trixie is the Hermione Potter Puppet Pal with the I love to learn 😂
Not Trixie using the desktop quote again, literally word for word
Trixie's thight after this episode: 🔴🔴🔴
Remember T-9 word lmao
2:37 Björk memories
Katya seems obsessed with slapping Trixie's leg recently, Jeff and Ron just gave up on the buzz sound. lol. I mean, I get it completely though.
THE GREEEEN MIIIIILEEEE?! 😂
Tracy is giving us Totally Hair Barbie, and Katie is giving us dressed up Muttley with all of the wheezy laughing.
i love how the topic is computers and trixie is looking like a combination of synergy and jem but she sings with the misfits on the side
damn why katya so handsy this episode lmfaoo girl stop hitting the talent 😭  dont come for me, id shank the prime minister to get hit by herrrr
Come to Amsterdam Katya, sell your place, busy one here and live your best life forever more xoxo
i love you
The way I would have  pushed katya off the chair if I were trixie. Lol she was a bit handsome today. Lol
not Katya believing she is a millennial 🧓👴👵
Happy early birthday to Trixie were both millennial cusp born on Aug 23 XD... Tho I am younger 💅
I had that Barbie as a kid! Totally hair Barbie!!! Love both of you so much!!
Coming to the STAGE; Suddenly Salad and Julie S. Seizure....
They were not for it this episode 😂
Y'all should do an episode on siblings
katya beating up trixie for 12 minutes
11:40 They forgot to bleep this out for the Youtube version😂 Not that anyone watching cares though
I love the nod to "totally hair barbie" Trixie
The high school part got real 🥲
TOTALLY HAIR TRIXIE!
These two clearly didn't give a fuck about anything during this episode 😂
Trixie’s makeup is really serving abnormally hard
Sorry @TrixieMattel, I'm generation x and my dad brought home our first computer when I was five. But everybody ignores generation x anyway.
It’s true: etsy *is* a gay dating app
Katya’s dial-up screech has me crying 💀
i just want to know if katia DIY her heels?
Oh shit Trixie has early onset Alzheimer's.
:40 Trixie's angels wanna chat.
Katya wheezing 95% of the episode gave me life hunty diva boots werk!
No mention of gaming, Trixie?!
You roll down the menu - Katya’s Sex Menu. Katya’s next book, New York Times upcoming best seller HAHAHAH
This so relates to me! I met my husband on IRC. I had to wait for someone to get off the phone so I could get online! Hello, I'm old 😂😂😂
Whatever Katya is on this episode, I need it in my life
Trixie’s eyebrows getting lighter and lighter is such a culture shock
The fact that Trixie is paying homage to Totally Hair Barbie 💖💖💖
I always worry  Trixies one thigh slap away from beating Katya to death or something 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Smth seems off this episode hope everyones doing well and that im wrong 💚
KATYA'S DIAL UP SOUND ⚰️
Lady bunny and katya
Funny thing is im smoking while miss martel explained to katya how smoking and using a phone is easy
TOTALLY HAIR BARBIE SPOTTED
"Do you think Abraham Lincoln would have been shot if he had a computer?" Will live rent free in my mind for decades
AAAAAAAAAHHHHHH THAT TOTALLY HAIR LOOK
I want the man in the blue shirt at 08:35 to c** in my throat, snap my neck and hide my body.
7:00 Katya losing it then saying she doesn’t get it lol
Trixie’s outfit is giving me deep, original 80s Jem and the Holograms vibes and im here for it.
06:58 Katya fully assaulting Trixie and Trixie completely unfazed by it is literally everything 💀
how bruised are trixie’s lower thighs from katya beating the shit out of her this episode 😂
I love you Katya, but you're not a Millennial 😅😅😅
not the 'looking' cover at 8:17 having "the entire first season" in swedish underneath xD
Katya!! You are NOT a millennial, Sweetheart... Come sit with me at the Xennial table, Boo. Lol
watching this episode while being in hong kong was weird
The way I screamed at 6:12  Any GoT fans in here? Iykyk
Next episode Katya is just gonna pick Trixie up and throw her through a wall
UNHhhh ep 212 - Azealia Banks
‘You’re not gunna have a calculator in your pocket all the time’ I specifically remember thinking ‘yes I do and I will bitch’ when my maths teacher said this!!
"Do you think January 6th would have happened if we didn't have computers?" - what I was waiting for Katya to say
i love how this entire episode is just Katya WHEEZING
I love Trixie's wig today <3
This is one of my favourite Trixie wigs 🙌
this is the only video they've ever did that stayed on topic the whole time
Alan Turing and Von Neumann having a splendid time.
Love that Trixie is wearing the totally hair Barbie dress ❤
The wheeze is powerful in this episode!
ok so trixie is a fish now, got it
Really worried that Katya is off the wagon. Her vibes were all over the place. 😕
Sure you can type that way Katya! Just because it won't make sense doesn't mean you can't! And Trixie Mattel giving more Barbie than the whole Barbie movie!✨
This WHOLE episode is such a reletable content to me. I own a computer and the amount of things you are allowed to do is incredible...  I am speaking the obvious, but - as a person who uses the computer both at home and at work - I could not imagine my life without it, at least to a certain extent.  Such a great topic discussed by two great women... I love it ❤
My nanny would hold that cig tight between her crinkled fingers as she typed out a fb msg on the ole desktop with a single, curled-from-smoking fake nail (not finger, she used the nail ffs) taking a celebratory drag after completing a single sentence. She would also leave lit cigs around the house like incense so I guess even if she had a phone not much would’ve changed 😂 she could never understand why my brother (who was allergic to smoke) would have such a hard time staying the night😭 like nan you’re basically suffocating him with the cigcense sticks ffs
Katyas look on this episode is giving season 1 unhhh but with hillary clintons energy
DEAD DAD ON BEACH
the dont laugh at me bit lmao
I was about to be mad as a smoker when Trixie called Katya out for preferring the phone because she's a smoker...and then I was like "Okay she right tho" lol
Trixie’s legs in tatters after Katya got through with slapping them. 😂
Katya is a hot sexy single scam but she also will probably try to have sex with you at some point
JAJAJAJAJA !! The Madonna's celebration tour reference !! 💀💀💀💀
... 2:40 ... the " broken bone tone " ... listen to flavor flav track " get off my back " ...
As a gay I am still practicing the cam fun and never did anything in physical because it's easier to get a connection - praise the internet whores. Problematic? Maybe. Make me feel ecstatic? Definitely.
Idk if it’s the weed, but this is the funniest episode ever
Is trixie on ozempic?  She's so thin . Talk about being thinning. Is she gonna disappear too?
Do you love computer?
Katya was deff on sum today lmao
Why do they be roasting Madonna lately though? Did something happen between them?
They stayed on topic the whole episode ?? 😮
As a lesbian, I also was speaking to old men on the internet. Lmao
Katya so chirpy today
3:53 some girl got fingered under the lunch table when I was a freshman. And when she came back the next year( from rehab not from being suspended) she was caught sucking dick and cock on the stairs during class.
7:11 Tracey fighting for her fkn life to not get thrown off her chair via Katyas laughter
why does trixie look like roxy from FNAF SB
This is so funny, I need to download this episode right now...on my COMPUTER. :D
These gals are fabulous!
Didn’t even talk about the downsides of internet usage, like desensitization to violence and degradation of empathy. Widespread homophobia and misogyny?
Lol!!!! Thank you guys for this! Ya'll are the best!😀😂🔥💞
Hahaha Katya was having so much fun on this one
"Good evening and good morrow. Tis I." 📜
I love to learn too! Knowledge is power, after all. The smarts between y'all could light up L.A. for AT LEAST 45 mins. 😂 Thanks for another one! 😘💗✨
Millenials are also a generation that has experienced boredom _and now_ have a lack of boredom. There's so much to do now that I honestly find it hard to actually be bored. When I was a kid, it was all of the time. I would bug my mom often that I was bored, and wanted something to do and incrementally as I grew up that lessened and lessened.   There's always a fall back thing to do now, and one of them is rewatching these two god awful hags pull apart a perfectly good stream of conciousness.
is katya ok??? hope ure ok Katya
So glad to see Bjork returned as a voice guest for Katyas dial up impression
I can't believe Trixie was not in the Barbie movie ;'( how dare they
Suddenly salad was so good
Are these gals like nerds or something
Lol I used to have kids aol and if you cussed in a chat room they’d block you from getting on the internet for 12 hours. Lolololol. So what did I do? Cussed in the chat rooms.🤣
*Ahh so that's the suddenly salad joke i've seen on the twitter months ago.*
You don’t wake up like this?😘😘😘😘
i bet trixie is missing the days when The Touch was a forbidden fruit between them
love the laughs this episode omg I’m wheezing
Even if you're not a gamer is you have to type a lot you should get a mechanical keyboard. If you get a nice one, typing on it is truly an experience.
Wait, the editors/sensor agreement is like, "yeah Faggot is fine but you better not say shit or fuck. Cus that would really be pushing it over the line". 🤷🏻‍♂️
I’m a little disappointed they didn’t bring up the woman computers for NASA in the 60’s
Trixie I love this wig, just please throw away the mushroom shaped one
0:49 Serving Totally Hair Barbie realness! Thank you Trixie!
katyas energy is immaculate in this one. early seasons vibes
The way Katya laughs at Trixie’s jokes brings me to lifeeee 😂
UNHINGED
Episode on holidays please and thank you
The idea of Trixie and Katya imitating mashing their weenies while a pilot and all the passengers of a *light* aircraft crashes horrifically in the background, and neither of them even batting an eye... Mary, I laughed harder than I should have XD
6:55 TRIXIE GATHERED KATYA
The pink one is so terrify
trixies hair is actually insane
Sutten Lee Salad
Millennials are the crossover generation, we are the day walkers.  We grew up both going outside and running around, AND binging our favorite videos games at sleepovers.  We can see both how soft newer generations are, but also how stupid older generations are.
Honestly everyone should be a little gay.  IMO the great delusion is that anyone is 100% only attracted to one thing or another.  Tastes change, people are naturally curious and sexual...bisexuality is very likely the default state for humans and we, particularly men, get railroaded by shame and social pressure into becoming obedient little sex starved wage slaves.
when katya cant stop hitting and touching trixie when she cracks up its so funny lmaoooo
Trixie is giving 80s Barbie
Trixies totally hair Barbie look is serving
katya looks like a crackhead version of taylor swift today
Trixie: *breathes* Katya: *Intense Wheeze*
I love trixie's glamrock Roxy wig
Woaaahhh the editing was all over on this one, still love you guys
Totally Hair Trixie!!!
Trixie you are autistic and it’s time you join the cool kids club 😎
Katya following the "sometimes I start a sentence and I don't know where it's going, I just hope I find it somewhere along the way" style of narration LOL
Not the f@gget information 😂
The noises every time katya hits trixie has me extra sent this episode. This is a great episode.
Most of us who were there for the dawn of the internet will never be able to run for public office. Just a whole lotta unsupervised, directionless foolishment floating around out there. What a time. 😃
The ascension is hitting us all, the vibes are too high with this one send her up
katya has two modes of waking up: Duck face and smiling
This entire episode is Katya wheezing and slapping Trixie’s leg over and over
Is katya ok? One too many slaps today lol
The Fallout reference by the editors *chef’s kiss* 🤌🤌🤌
I love that we used to get the buzz for the tiniest touch but now Katya just grabs Trixie by the arm and knee, essentially shaking her 😅
I hate how older people would get mad at younger people (Millennials/Z) for looking stuff up on their phone... They'd literally get mad about us going "Oh damn no one knows, someone look it up real quick" and you end up having a group learning moment.
It's kind of heartwarming to see how Katya has gone from being someone who practically felt pain when being touched to someone who is so close with their friend that they are constantly touching and smacking them while cracking up.
"i look so pretty today" "and i wanna go home"  bout sums them up lol
9:44 me when people ask me what my gender is
Katya fully had the zoomies
The Jerrica Benton and Jem fits are really 🔥🔥🔥
ka ..... tya's ........... SHOES
A contact reference in 2023? I win!
Trixie with Hunger Games vibes.
please never stop doing these
I miss those printers with the tear off edges and you could print stupid little fun banners
Katya was bringing the 2-5 season energy this episode
@MikeeRogers 0:08 😁
Lmao Katya "WELCOME! Youve got mail!" omg I DO remember that.
OMG, Katya. I have that same dress...which I wore to my Sweet 16! <3
Trixie’s thigh: 0 Katya: 87,654
Katya's laugh is my favorite laugh in existence
the editing of this show is reaching achievements hitherto unimaginable to humankind, truly next level
5:11 Katya in her Miss Spice era 💅🏼✨
Katya was extra slappy in this one. 😅
9:09 that Contact reference snuck in there!
Trixie: “I look so pretty today.” Katya: “You do! And I wanna go home.” Felt.
De editing is unmatched!!❤
Katya was SO DONE filming this episode, it makes me WORRIED for the show.
“I know…. I wrote two books with you.”
The topic could be nuclear cold war and these crossdressers will find a way to talk about jerking off
Fuckin FINALLY she's wearing the Totally Hair Pucci dress. Took her ass long enough.
I love how sometimes (the summer episode) they completely abandon the topic altogether, and sometimes one of them keeps just saying the topic name (Trixie in this case) to get them back on the rails
it was rude of them to make the background the same shade of white as Katya's skin in this ep.
Um these looks are like holy grail level of “I’m not allowed to look at such beauty”
I was waiting on miss martel to pull this wig out the box again 💅🏼
Katya is out here bruising Trixie's knee today. 😂😂 ❤
one of these days that buzzer effect is gonna break
How did I not know that Katya used to be a sex worker? :/
Blue one go😂😂😂😂 while slap pink one very funny pink one very terrify😅😂😂😂😂😂
This episode’s editing is so fucking funny holy shit 😂
OMG she's so beautiful
I always forget that most Americans can't even jerk off without lube 'cause they're circumcised :/
Just happened to watch the out of the closet tour and am impressed I recognized Katyas shoe
"I know, I wrote two books with you" - wait, they have a second book coming out???
I smoke cigs while using my work laptop all the time it's totally possible but does result in me having to wipe ash from my keyboard and keyboard shaped grid of ash from the screen every time I open it up at work so maybe Trixie is onto something
i am going through some things right now and this was the first thing to make me laugh in so long. Thank you 🤍
Katya waking up as Goldie Hawn 🙌🏼
I support queer rights but also queer wrongs and trixie's wig is one of those
I love this hair on trixie. Its very rocker Barbie
Every second I start to feel like I need new trixie and Katya content it is send to me in the form of unhhh the pod or I like to watch, it is a glorious time to be
katya touching trixie  a lot this episode. kind of weird
The editing is TURNT this season. I'm living for it.
Katya totally reminds me of the rich bimbo in Altered Carbon
God bless the editors as usual! Dying here over "Dead Dad on The Beach.......$1"
The only Barnes & Noble near me (in our most run-down mall) recently BECAME a B. Dalton and no one I know knew wtf that was—and lo and behold here’s Trixie educating the children
Hillary Clinton has a MUCH higher kill rate than OJ Simpson.
katya... i love you but stop grabbing trixies thigh please
Trixie went home with the biggest bruise on her left thigh for this episode.
The email reply difference between phone and computer/laptop 🤣🤣 so true
Toenail sculptures... that's all
40 years of hits
the answer to the division question is 445.5
TOTALLY HAIR BARBIE OUTFIT ON TRIXIE!!!!!!!! AAAAAAHHHHH
T: "Where u from?" K: "Hongkong" T: "Wow, your English is really good!" 💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
Katya: “it’s time to goon and bate 😁”   SIS 😭😂
is it just me or someone else noticed how katya is acting kinda off and way too excited? this episode made no sense and trixie looks like she's annoyed
9:11 hAvE yOu SeEn My DeAd DaD??
they're 3x older than me and i still hating the computer to look for information or study, also, i hate my phone. i wish to be carefree like those two ladies with no hate towards the internet business
what is choice moo balance a reference to
Please welcome to the stage:
Katya seemed so stoned in this episode lol
Why are the Unhhhh videos shorter with less content?
Trixie's dress is the amalgamation of every dream dress nine to twelve year-old me held on to dearly, and never let go of into deep adulthood. Perfection.
@6:05 k stolen from the podcast...same typing story....i think im way past too deep....i might as well change my name to The Deep and join The Seven..
trixie: dont laugh katya: i wont laugh trixie: i LOVE to learn katya: *dying bird screech*
I'm LOVING this new Katya laugh
NEW CONTACT JOKE ALERT 9:05
Katya's getting senile
4:35 Yeah so newsflash to all the circumsized folks you dont need lube/lotion if you're intact. In a place where no-one gets the snip i was confused for a long time why US media portrays lotion being part of the experience.
Hey Flop, Gurl you’ve done it again, lowering the bar for all us, I would say I’m surprised but I know who you are ✨💖Lazy Queen 💖✨
That burp ... I felt that, I smelled that
It’s really not a far jump at all from Hillary to OJ 😅
"Sometimes my ear rings when people around me look horrible" that came out of NOWHERE😭 IMPROV WOW
The BLUE one so WHEEZE  (Congrats on quitting smoking Katya!)  Edit: 6:49 - 6:51
PLEASE LESS EDITING!!!!!❤❤❤
Suddenly Salad sent meeeeeee. 😅😅
im convinced Trixie was kaya's relator...trapping her in a mortgage so she'll work for the next 100 years. talk about faustian Baribie!
You know why? Cause you're a smoker.

Since when is trizie saying that her and katya are the same generation
“…because you can get on Craigslist on your T-Mobile phone, bitch!” LEGEND!
Is Katya high? 😂😂😂
4:55..."WE HAVE TO GET YOU SMART BULBS!"...  My stupid ears: "WE HAVE TO GET YOU SMART BALDS!" 😂🤪
6:50 trixie your a smoker    me. loads bowl again , .
Nicole Kidman voice: I love to learn
Katya nust have been high🤣🤣
Idk if it’s supposed to be a reference but trixies dress is very totally hair Barbie
katyas bringing back her season 1 wheezibg
Ooh. I'm loving Trixie's cheek contour here! It's soft and not too harsh! ❤
does anyone else not get notifications for this series? i'm stuck with what seems like every other WOW notification except the one i subscribed for pfft
These crazy asses never disappoint!
11:40 uhh I think you missed a censor beep 😅😅😅
This is the earliest I've been in a UNHhhh episode
"Suddenly Salad", I'm dead...
the amount of touching in this vid is everything
Katya's dial-up impression is so fucking funny
This is one of the best episodes recently imo
yo siempre creí q cuando los viejos en omegle decian ASl, significaba american sign language, mi vida fué una mentira
Oh some of the pranks we pulled/bullshit we spread as kids we would never get away with now due to the internet like the timeI convinced my friend that the reason it had changed from oil of olay to oil of ulay was because the olay was actually a small Ecuadorian animal like a hedgehog and you squeezed the oil for the moisturizer from it's anal glands but it was close to extinction so they were changing to a close cousin. The Ulay from San Salvador......she believed it for months!!!😂😂😂😂
I’ve never seen Katya manhandle Trixie more than she did in this episode 😂
I toootally wake up like that... what?
The Totally Hair Barbie look! I live!!!
I was on AOL when I was in middle school. I know all about the creepy old guys in chat rooms!
Trixie's wig is Dale Bozzio approved. (Look her up, young ones!)
Katya is happy today lol full of energy 😂
Katya is giving me real Muttley snickering giggles with her wheeze and I could listen to it for years
"And I want to go home." Katya was so real for that
i used to have a recurring dream where an old Appalachian man rocking on his porch with a shotgun told me "a storm is coming" so now I know what the mystic signs were. The signs were gay
TOTALLY HAIR BARBIE!
Trixie’s thighs must be red from how much Katya was slapping them 😂
Kraftwerk Computer World.
Editors, please don't use music to highlight Hong Kong or any Asian city. That was not a great moment.
The red one so wheeze
5:12 let's see Elon try to replace these birds with X's
The bejewelled heeled clogs i cannot but also living
I think Suddenly Susan would be a great drag name
Not Trixie (a Virgo) being like “I love learning” and Katya (in true Taurus fashion) being like “I wanna go home…”
“Is it suddenly Seymour or suddenly Susan?” “It’s suddenly salad” **INSTANT WHEEZE FIT** My favorite clip as of now
1:20 the fact that the reddit on the computer is CONTACT LOVERS...the editors r fucking BOMB
Y'all need to talk about tattoos so we can get a tour of Katya's tattoos
Is Katya back on drugs?
Tracy has her F*CKIN hair on
Katya constantly slapping Trixie's knee was so cute 💜💜
AAAHHHHH TOTALLY HAIR TRIXIE!!!
Trixie looks so good, I can’t stand it!
Katya looks more and more like Hayley Williams every day
Where all my old heads at? Remember this: “A/S/L,” the sound of dial up, & PRODIGY???  Good times 😂😂😂
Living for the totally hair Barbie look!
the fact that millenials were the last generation noot to see their childhood photos from a screen
I like when the openings are random chaotic vignettes.
Hillary did do it.  I wouldn't even be surprised if it turned out, after I die and I'm omniscient, I discover that she killed Epstein herself like physically went there she mind-controlled the guards to sleep she broke the cameras and she strangled that nonce. With her bare hands.
does anyone know where to find the “bowbowbow” song from 4:52?
I feel they've lost the will to live filming this show now.
"Do you think Abraham Lincoln would have been shot if he had a computer?"
Roller blade barbie ❤
i bet all the money that ive ever seen in my whole entire life that katya smoked a j just before filming that
Katya ATTACKING tracys leg this episode 😂
desperately seeking salad
I had more chat sex as a 10-11 y girl in 2002 than i had in total durin the fcking decades of being a grown up 💀 old internet was really something
Ah, finally, Totally Hair Trixie for us pewoors.
I’m pressing F and nothing is happening!🙃
Tracey's poor legs 😂😂😂😂
"Dry, like an acorn?" 😐 Kudus to the editors for "Katya's Street Menu." One Frozen Pipes, please.
I'm somewhere between Millenial and Gen Z and it boggles my mind that I often understand basic computer issues better than my father, who works in IT.
The amount of touching in this video is off the charts
barbie n oppenheimer
If you told me this was a random episode, I would've believed you 😅
This episode was 90% wheezing...and I love it
Well I am a book collector and have a large library so I have to shout out books.  But computer love is one of The best songs Ever made.
OMG..Suddenly Salad.....
this show keeps me alive its like my daily vitamin
OBSESSED WITH PRINTERS.  And printers’ devils.
This one was a slow burn but  when it finally started going off the rails, whooo chile.
Katyas face at the start of this episode is so relatable hahah
"The computer"
Trixie's mood looked a bit down today, Katya was definitely trying to cheer her up, I hope everything gets ok🎉❤
11:39 did they forget to censor f*ggot or am i losing my mind
They both wear the same size glove. Hilarious
My email are always starting with "Good evening and good morrow, tis I!" since I have seen this clip XD
Do you think Abraham Lincoln would have been shot if he had had the computer???
Trixie honey.....I love learning too.... Research stuff for days online..... It's called hyper focus.... many of us with ADHD do that there same thing  🤣🤣🤣
RIP to Trixie's left knee
THE GREEN MILE REFERENCE
Do you love C o m p u t e r?
Im a Gen Z, early Gen Z (1997) and I do remember dial-up a bit but also the transition from MySpace to Facebook. Also, as a gamer, looking up cheat codes got a lot easier then having a massive stack of game informer magazines. Ahhh youth. I miss it.
women in STEM 😌☝️
I think Trixie needs to have kneepads for Katya's slaps and I feel like Katya needs her inhaler. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
ive never felt more seen then katya explaining waking up. its like you are fighting to get you eyes out of dream world and into reality as you are trying desperately to process the real world and it feels exactly like that
I love you guys y’all so silly
Going from Hillary to O.J is no mistake
can i just say i'm THRILLED katya's extended wheeze laugh is back with a vengeance
Katya’s beat looking like a Russian grandmother named “Katya”.
TOTALLY HAIR, TRACY MARTEL
Trixie's a dry girl and Katya uses lube. That's why Katya is sparkling and Trixie gives a matt finish.
"I love, don't laugh at me."   "I'm not gonna laugh!"   "Okay, I love to learn!"   *cue the wheeze*
I wish I had been better at understanding computers growing up. Like actually learn it as a skill. I was just slightly too young to get it though
I use the voice text ALWAYS lol sometimes I forget to proofread and just send and it comes out not making any damn sense or picking up somebody else talking in the background
katya really hurt trixie with that smack
Santa in the chat rooms is funny until you remember what we learned about old people in the last episode.
FINALLY, THE DAY HAS ARRIVED. Katya has officially interrupted Trixie every single time this episode, how the turn tables...
Yo I’m 2 minutes in and the editing is fucking killing me god damn
F
Trixie: don't laugh at me Katya: I'm not going to laugh (she's going to laugh) two seconds later, katya became a dying/excited donkey
The editing is nothing short of lit, krunk, and turnt today honey.
Trixie's hair, all I see is Gwen Shamblin lmao 😅
Boa
"Please turn on your computer" 😭🖥️ back to the home grandma
Trixie is a dry guy. Good to know.
Wanna cyber?
Is this a re run or am i insane?
asdf jkl semicolon
They weren't feeling the computers🤣🤣🤣
Their hearts weren't in it. Maybe you need to go back to a trashier subject.
katya: ✋🏼👋🏼🫲🏼✋🏼👋🏼🫲🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
I have a decently nice PC for watching movies, editing videos etc. It helps when you have a big screen tv as a monitor. :D All other shit just use your phone.
I would've thought Katya was the dryjacker of the two
So Katya is basically Muttley now...? 🤔😂
best intro in so many episode omfg
this is cool, love watching them.
“Suddenly salad” cured my depression.
Hated that phone ringing, gave me the anxieties
i feel like katya was very high while filming this
“Do you think Abraham Lincoln would’ve been shot if he’d had the computer?”   She’s so fkn unhinged I can’t
I'm sorry but the stock photos and videos have gotten too much, I want to see our lovely ladies and what exactly they are serving us.
katyas more wheezy today hope shes feeling alright
Trixie was really smacked around this episode 😭😂
Why I did it - Hilary Clinton (dictated but not read) 😂😂😂😂
Totally Hair Barbie!
I love thz two bitches so fucking much. Katya cracking up àt Trixie. Trixie loving to make her làugh... Beautiful.
Someone on Twitter: "Millennials were the first to get computers as kids"  Gen X:  🤨
They haven't been so off topic in one episode since the Shopping part 1. I live.
Are you sure this isn't a Random Complication?
When you act like the Internet started with AOL, I smile and remember being a part of a Rocky Horror Picture Show cast on IRC. Finding adult BBS' to play sexy roleplaying games. Hooking up with BBS sys admins whenever you're in the mood. Ahhhh, the memories.
Trixie got that old skool cruising technique DOWN.
That Suddenly Salad line was so fast and out of left field, it had me dying!
Anyone else have to rewind when katya starts wheeze laughing and trying to speak at the same time? It’s the best part of any episode for me 😭😭
Had the exact dress trixie is wearing for my amazing hair barbie 😂
The string of letters that is ASL is triggering to the point of nausea
Trixie: don't laugh at me Katya: *reaches Nirvana*
'emancipate me daddy!' -Lincoln
katya was particularly silly this episode and i love it
Oh I gasped when I saw Trixie. It was like Christmas all over again when I unwrapped my Totally Hair Barbie and I screamed. Thank you for nearly exploding this elder millennial's heart! I'm so jealous 😂
Katya not yelling "EXTRA! EXTRA!" and just saying the word calmly is so weird 😂
welll I need to know. dos trivia have black and blue  bruise ?? gehhhsss  yrs of  being slapped  ..lol
this episode was too funny 😂
SHE SAID A S D F J K L *SEM* as in semicolon.  SO RUDE.
The fact that I have to watch every episode at least 3 times because there are so many good jokes that I just have to take my time to appreciate them
I laughed so hard the whole time i just love them sm <3333
Katya's impression of what she looks like when she wakes up is the most beautiful thing I've seen today, comedy genius
Trixie "I Love to Learn" Mattel
Millennials were the first generation with dial up?? Gen X says "hello" . . .
The desk top, desk verse and desk btm joke 5:58
♥
This episode is literally just Trixie dropping truth bombs while Katya commits assault and battery while gasping for air
Katya will take any opportunity to get tactile. If Trixie wasn't padded, she'd leave every taping bruised and battered
F
katya looks so gorgeous
These two gals really love each other alot 🌈❤️🥰
There should have been a slap counter
I just watched the PSA and holy shit that's basically an SNL skit
"Why I Did It" by Hillary OJ Clinton
it’s totally hair trixie!
KATYA IS KYLIE MINOGUE CONFIRMED
I must be a gay guy cause man was I talking to some old men
"I shouldn't have been doing a lot of the things online that I was doing"  this should be the official motto of Gen Z
I had that Barbie growing up.
Omg that looks like the Totally hair Barbie Dress Trixie! 💗
My cure of depression
this is one of the best episodes since episode 142
I wake up like that lol
Why are you keeping burping moments, that's disgusting edit that shit out
Sometimes they sound like aliens pretending so hard to be human
Ahhhh dial up. Takes me back to my childhood. And if someone would use the phone it really sucked. The children will never understand the amount of joy and anxiety that dial up internet gave us.😂
Not Katya’s old ass thinking she’s a millennial
I want whatever Katya was having this episode 😂
Does anyone else get ready for new episodes? I've got the wine chilling and I've picked out my nail color picked out to paint my nails.
Lmao the edit of Ron and Katya going to see The Green Mile for "anything over an hour" that bit will never get old
Not S twice on the same row of the keyboard
"Sometimes my ear rings when people around me look horrible" This is an underrated roast!
finally katya burps away from trixie
OMG IM SO EARLY
The car honking noise is the only acceptable noise in place of the bzzzz noise
honestly i wake up exsctly like katya
It was a Gay man who invented Modern Computers! Alan Turning developed the enigma machine which evolved into the computer we know today!
The Grace and Frankie deep cut was noted and appreciated.
Yes perra, I will have a calculator in my pocket at all effing times
Katya spoke very fluently in kettle this episode
5:52 Trixie WAS hurt in the making of this video 😂
Trixie loves this damn wig.
THE SMOKING BIT IT'S SO HILARIOUS 😭😭😭😭😭
new editor hmmmm
I’m so surprised at how these two biological women bring me so much joy. Between them and Alyssa Edwards I’m going to love forever. 😂
Katya i love your style and tracie i love your attitude
I'm watching this 😢on my TV by screen sharing it from my phone/computer. 😂 gotta love cellphones/computers these days.
Katya! Your wheezing laughs are making my day:))). 🤣😅😂
Pretty sure Katya weezed 90% of this episode
Good luck to the people Who play the "take a shot every time Katya touches Trixie" with this eposide. Hope you have a lovely hospital stay
Barbie having a side hustle with Taylor.
I think the left dude is really rude to the right dude
Seriously didn’t know what they were talking about today.. Katya is hyped 💫
They’re looking ROUGH this episode. Katya’s wig from episode 5 crawled on set and onto her head.
love when katya is having a great time
'Oh god, sometimes my ear rings when someone looks ugly...' Oh, sorry bitch - i forgot mirrors were a trigger for you honey.  *trying to be funny for myself, their friendship and poking fun at each other is none of my business
I always waited for someone like Katya who also has an intimate knowledge of mediocre 90's movies/shows with ratings lower than 6.5 on imdb that most ppl completely forgot about. We could drink coffee with 4 sugars  together discussing classics like Suddenly Susan, Girl 6, Soapdish, Copycat, Sliver, Color Of Night, Sleeping With The Enemy, Sliding Doors etc. 👁️👄👁️
It’s so weird how it’s true that there’s no excuse to not know how to do things these days…. And yet people know how to do less, and also, I notice, don’t believe you if you know how to do anything.
The way I didn't doubt that was not Trixie Mattels real body in the thumbnail. 😗
Miss Katya really didn't wanna be at work this time god bless her
not Sutton Lee Salad 💀
Do i see a 1989 reference?!?! Besties don’t do this to me I’m too vulnerable rn
Adult men that dont use lube when masturbating? What?! Why?!
Shoutout to Katya for quitting smoking since filming this! Seeing that “former smoker” sign correction made me feel so proud ❤️
I keep saying it, their editor deserves a raise after EVERY. EPISODE. 🤣
Katya doesn’t wake up smiling anymore, she wakes up doing what she’s doing at 5:12
What's Katya's username on Contact Fans?
Trixie fully thinking she is making Kstya laugh judt by the genius of her humor, when we all know Katya laughing because shr is fawning to dissipate Trixies bad mood.
I can’t see them now as anything other than career woman stenographers, coked out in probate court in 1983
katya looks like a weapon lol
Ok I call bs: Trixie would’ve emailed Jamie, not Joffrey since he was, well… dead 😂
I needed this so bad today
8:18 why the Swedish DVD box of Looking?
Think Miss Tracey Martel saying "don't yell at me" when Katya wasn't yelling at her is something we should all do and adopt in our daily lives, its the funniest thing in the world. Tracey Martel ~ gaslighter 2023
Desk top, desk vers, desk bottom
Katya uncontrollably slapping Trixie is all I needed today
Is this a rerun?
the episodes are getting so specific can we maybe delve into communist theory nd politics for the next one tysm
Totally hair Trixie omg 💜👩🏼
I love to learn
The gen x kids got commodore 64s in the early 80s
The number of times that Katya just says the word "Computer" as a sentence or reply is sending me
how many times did those two biological women said « computer » ?
trixie: don’t laugh at me katya: I won’t  trixie: I love to learn  katya: *instant wheeze*
Katya’s dress looks a lot like one Micarah Tewers made
- don’t laugh at me - i’m not gonna laugh - i love to learn  *proceeds to laugh*
Holy shit I’m so early.
But is Katya ok? It feels like that dark era is coming back.
🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
As a computer scientist - I'm dying 😂 😂
i got a haircut today, and surprisingly, katya has the same one i got. im writing on my computer.
Anyone else recognize the sound they used for the light bulbs from Jungle Run? Lol
Love love these two ❤😂😂
“Dead Dad on the Beach $1” 🙈
I hope Katya's just high on life and not spiralling into coke. It's not great for your teeth, apparently.
Damn that's some circumcized men conversationss right there 4:18 lmao
Is this a repost?
Trixie was invading katya's personal space a lot this episode.
Is Katya smoking again?
A storm is coming
YESS she’s brought out the Totally Hair Barbie look again SLAY  Also SHE SHOULD’VE BEEN IN THE BARBIE MOVIE AHH
Trixie this is a SERVE 💞
PHOMPUTER!!! Hahahaha
asdfjklsm
Hillary Clinton’s book is What Happened sub title Libya a very unfortunate sequence of events.  “Im just chilling in a Libyan slave market.”
Literally my favorite show on YouTube for years
Trixie: don’t laugh at me Katya: im not gonna laugh  Tracy: i love to learn  Katie: TEAKETTLE NOISES
Trixie: Don't laugh at me... Katya: I'm not gonna laugh. Trixie: I love to learn... Katya: HUUEEEEHHHHHHHHHHHH
OK, but, the quickness with which Trixie came back with "It's 'Suddenly Salad,'" was SO fuq'ing funny. 😂
She's on antibiotics for sure.
"Dead Dad on Beach...1$" . . . And I sincerely taught that we are over this😂😂😂
:-)
“Suddenly Salad” took me OUT
Trixie's wig and off the shoulder outfit is giving loosey laduca, or maybe loosey was giving trixie the whole time
Katya's shoes might be my favorite...ever
i’ve honestly haven’t seen katya laugh so much in one episode
Katya is sooo physical this episode lmao
10:46 The Detail! Of putting that billboard in the back is so good. 10out of 10 made me chuckle.
Hahhahhahahahha the car horn
the way trixie thinks that straight people are eating pussy, wishful thinking,,,
I LOST IT at the Smart Bulbs.
It's the Totally Hair Barbie dress that Trixie is wearing for me.
All about the phomputer! 😂 Say it out loud lol
I just love the evolution of Katya not being allowed to really touch Trixie, to straight up assaulting her now lmao
Why are my favorite episodes the ones where they’re clearly exhausted
Katya was in a really good mood and I love it
i love this new era katya is in where she repeats the funny thing under her breath while laughing like a noisy window cleaner❤
Ladies -- THAT was effin' funny! And I wanna be "Suddenly Salad" someday when I grow up.
katya just wheezes at whatever coming out of trixie's mouth
Totally Hair Trixie looks great!!!
just realised how much crazier this show looks without the edits
that masturbating dry part got me so damn dead 💀😂the voodoo doll with music 💀💀
Katya looks so good in blue.
“Right in front of my Suddenly Salad??!”
trixie saying don’t laugh at me was mistake number one. katya will laugh like her life depends on it😂
Please do an episode on birds
Tricia not making a single cameo in the Barbie movie is the most homophobic crime to occur in recent years
Oddly enough, I work at a library and we have a partnership with local farms to give their surplus crops to the community for free. We had corn today. SO you can get corn at the library!
This is probably the most beautiful I've ever seen Trixie <3
"do you love computer?"
That Carmen San Diego reference was genius
0:31 when Trixie said “truth or dare…” she sounded like Cat in the Hat from the live action when he’s trying to get the guy to sign the papers with the giant pen
SERVING JEM AND THE HOLOGRAMS REALNESS
Kaytasssss killling it
This is what I cam forrrrr
We’ve been blesses
This whole episode is just Trixie: I- Katya: *asthma attack*
In this episode: Katya wheezes more than she talks. 😆
They still got it
Sis we are being fed today!
ok but how is the HiLaRiOus Ross Matthews the first one you think of?
Great Editing
u can feel the weird vibe in the room what is it
I kept waiting for Trixie to show up in the Barbie movie
I saw someone say that  they never know if Katya is going to say absolutly or absolutly not and it holds true to this day
Guys.. Gen X had computers, the internet, all that stuff. Analog childhood, digital teenage years
Katya's "I'm not gonna laugh" followed by an IMMEDIATE wheeze was so good
Katyas look is givinggg
Thanks God I needed this today please never stop
y’all are iconic, WORK THAT PUSSY OUT BITCHES. KATYA LET ME KNOW IF U WANT MY LEG 4 FREE 🥰
i need to know more about kataya SW days
Slay
Katya STOP yelling!
If Katya doesn’t stop fucking yelling… I swear. It’s just so annoying at this point
Ah, the Wikipedia rabbit hole.  One entry leads to another and soon I know what airlines fly to Luanda and how Blackhawk County Iowa voted in the 1948 presidential election.
Trixie is giving Totally Hair Barbie and I live.
THEIR SO FUNNY LMFAOO I CANT…
trixies legs must be covered in bruises by now :D
the way they talk about computers makes me realize how much older they are than me
YAAAAAAY!!!!!!
cant believe I'm actually early
Katya goes off grid, leaves her computer, Trixie left on the little stool going “I wouldn’t be surprised if we never saw Ms Zamolodchikova again 🤭”
Hey Flop
Take a shot every time Katya slaps Trixie's leg.
I love that there is both footage of Val, Trixie's mom, both as herself and in drag on Trixie's YouTube channel, AND YET Jeff, Paul, and Ron continue to use that graphic of Trixie's face with a purple wig as her.
Oh I miss the days of AIM 😩
Katya is the type of girl who would watch necrophilia porn think it’s fake, then find out after that it was a real dead body.
trixie looks fucking HOT!!
my favorite eggs
I'm dying Goldie Haughn😅
They should’ve cast Trixie as Totally Hair Barbie in the Barbie movie
this trixie wig is giving sugar and spices grandma
Wowowow  !!
Exactly what i needed
Trixie is giving me Jem and the Hologramzzzz
