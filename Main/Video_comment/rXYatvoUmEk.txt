Martineli good
8:03 😂😂😂
Que hermoso ❤
My Arsenal for life ♥️
This guy loves arsenal
Dream come true arsenal champion 2023/24 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
I love mikel sm he so special
Mikel knew what Partey was expected to do (time 6.52). He was visibly instructing Partey to go long.
Arsenal really need to hire you to produce content for them. Incredible work. Brought a tear to my eye.
Who noticed substitute board showed wrong number for Leondro 11 instead of 19
5:42 watch how Mikel runs over to Martinelli to give him instructions and he does exactly that 🧠👍🏽
Seeing HAVERTZ with the assist makes the victory feel so much better… 😂
@manchesterunited we need bench cam like this
Arsenal legend Martin Keown opposes recruiting a ‘gambler addicted striker’… “The shortcomings are clear” Ivan Toney showed his best performance in the 2022/23 season, but he ended up having an accident. Last May, Tony placed a bet that his team would lose and was banned and fined for 232 breaches of FA betting regulations between 2017 and 2021. And Tony admitted in an interview that he started getting 'a bit excited' by gambling when he was 15, and that the more money he got, the 'higher the stakes got.' In conclusion, does Arsenal need Ivan Toni, who has so many problems? No, it is not necessary at all. He shouldn't put too much pressure on Arsenal.
I love arsenal
What's wrong with Rice? This guy didn't even give Tomiyasu a look, no smile at all, didn't even give him a hug after the game. Given how he celebrates with other team mates it looked so strange.
Love you Arsenal ❤❤ Form…Fan club Thailand ❤❤ 🎉🎉
I Need take kubo
Артета похож на Зомби
7:02
Togetherness of this team is incredible!!
Someday I want to go to Emirates and sing North London Forever with the Gooners
Pep wagging his finger after the first Kovacic tackle, come on bro
It's actually mental how we are the greatest football team in the world
Good job coach and team
It cant the North Bank anymore....its the Celebration End magnet corner.😅
0:38... Syco... 😅
I love you Arsenal.
富安はなんでもできるから膠着状態の切り札としてアルテタにとって最高のカード
best atmosphere at the emirates for a loooong while
Арсенал алға! Чемпион болады осы жылы!!!
spain.  vs spain
How do you not show the reaction to the second yellow that wasnt?!
777 COMMENTS PARTEY OVERSTOOD THE ASSIGNMENT
I wonder why when mesut ozel talked about what was china doing  he got kicked out of the clup, What about the Ukrainian z.......??
Celebrating a deflected goal like winning a trophy lmao  Watch us go on a winning run streak.
After the goal the captain run staring to the Manager…. For further information
🇻🇳🇻🇳❤arsenal
I can't remember when Trossard was number 17. Damn sub maker🤣🤣
❤🎉
Finally! It is DONE!!! 😭
I love this club ❤🤍
2:07 that is shocking. we went from finishers like rvp, eduardo and alexis to nketiah
Pep sees that goal happen ha.
OK I have never seen anything like this before all 4 subs in the passage of play leading to a goal in  consecutive passes frm one to the other
Good! It is Chelsea next. Dem must collect 😅
Artetas reaction to Ben's nutmeg 😂😂😂
That goal was coached. You can see Arteta prior to the goal call out Tomi and signal to him to stick together to Havertz and as soon as Partey gets the ball, signals to him to go long. My fogging manager
sekarang apa2 dkontenin, besok mungkin ada kamera 1 person,
Лучшие с лучшим тренером! 🔴
Good job
Thanks.  From Jamaica 🇯🇲
Mikel Arteta ของจริง
That atmosphere at the Emirates 😮🎉😃🤍❤️ rare 💫
Let’s sign Victor Osimhen 💯✅
Guys, Arteta is the one! I believe
The amount of pressure , I would have a heart attack 🛐
I noticed when Kovacic wrongfuly tackled Odegaard, Arteta wants to react but keep his calm so the ref won't put the blame of their guilty on him. COYG
Jesus is good at RW but the guy cant pass. Odegaard was wide open for a pass but instead Jesus hits it right at a City defender trying to shoot. Awful decision making from him. Very poor.
That split second before the ball goes in gives me goosebumps cuz everyone goes silent
a cagey affair that ended in our victory
We are The Arsenal.
🍚🍚👶
nổi da gà
Since the moment arteta gave his first interview. I felt something special I don't know why but he gave me hope. After the tough seasons I still felt he was building something. Im proud of what we've accomplished and I'm proud to call mikel our coach ❤🤍❤️
How is that Zionist Zinchenko allowed to play after making a political statement?  Mesut Ozil wasn't given that luxury! Why aren't Arsenal condemning his behaviour and dropping him from the squad like they did with Ozil?
London is Red!!
Im a 57 year old man and never cried so much as i did when Martinelli scored against man c .....come on boys you got this. i truly beleive Mikel is the main man in the league well done again boys stay strong
Mikel wasn’t he’s regular normal fired up self…He was more conserved than usual. I think it’s because he was up against a man he respects so much in Pep.
I hope we have arteta for many years to come what a great manager he’s becoming
I like the way that arteta sits down at the start of the match but it doesn't take him long to stand up.
Arteta was unusually calm this game. Feels like it was transmitted to our team.
I'm watching this back, and it makes me smile ear to ear. ❤😊
Arsenal now has to stay focused on winning every match 👏 after the international break. God willing 🙏. COYG. Arsenal rocks 🏆 🙏 🤲 🪨 🎸 😎.
That was a well thought out play for the goal think arteta plan that🤔
What a day!!! That was the strongest, most controlled and most disciplined performance I've seen from an Arteta team, they were absolutely flawless!!!
The handshake thingy btwn Super Mik and his assistants🥹
4:07 at x0.5 speed
MERIAM LONDON🔥🔥🔥
Booo
FIRST PIN? IM A HUGE GUNNERS FAN PLEASE I BOUGHT A SIGNED JERSEY OF ODEGAARD FOR U THX INVINCIBLES 💯❤🔫
2:25 pep really said "nuh uh" after the obviously red card tackle by kovacic 😭😭😭
@1:28 that point from Arteta, i've seen it before . Lucky it wasnt Tomiyasu this time
Đứng gần như là full trận. sự nhiệt huyết có thừa
what a win to us, we are no longer boys as others used to refer us, we are now Men
3:23 The referee made a mistake in changing players
For ever my love Arsenal.❤
Arsenal or Nothing series return this season
I love bench cam
Arsenal win is equally to Man city win.
Who is the coach NJ? 😅
Finally after long times 8 yearsss 🔥🔥
That shot of Arteta and Pep should be framed. Great shot by the photography team.
I DONT LIKE RAYA!!!
Even Mikel couldn't believe that Ben White nutmegged Doku lmao just look at his reaction 🤣😂
Sorry for ateta out 2 years ago
RAMSDALE ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
7:00 YEAHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!🎉
Arteta the TACTICIAN
Very Good My Team.
Arsenal football philosopy...
I love this club so much
Justice served!
Brilliant play by The Arsenal.
What a team!
3:04 Halaand trying to body Saliba and getting ragdolled 😂
The reaction to White's nutmeg is priceless😵
I Love arsenal
Go Arsenallll  Zinchenko out
8:02 la réaction de Mikel, ça me termine 😂😂😂🤩
The Arsenal way 🤝🏻
this is huge win, If Arsenal really wants to be a real contender, they have to beat the title holders at least once
Martinelli's cameo in 45minutes is crazy❤
Arteta is a genius.. Doesn't matter win, lose, or draw, there is always some changes and learning each of every games.. so trust Arteta..
I remember days when Arteta asked for  time and to trust the process....the unity is mind blowing 😅...if only my dad were alive to see this 😢.. .I can't wait to see us one day lift that EpL trophy
William saliba pocket is too heavy after keeping haaland for 90mins..finally our saliba can rest now..
Pep went straight to the bench when we scored 😂
I love arsenal jersey it looks  smart
The way Arteta sees the game is another level, look at him when Partey got the ball, he clearly guided him to pass the ball to Tomiyasu
Extended highlights>bench cam
Arteta is coolest dad any young Arsenal player could ever have. A fundamentally competant football IQ, that understands how people function at work and at life, humble man with dreams so big but arteta can get arsenal there. ❤From a Reading FC fan, we played the best game in leauge cup history btw in 2012
Respect to Benerdo silva
Saliba and Gabriel bullying martinelli😂🤣🤣🤣😂
Vamos Arsenal 😊
6:51-6:56 as soon as Partey touch the ball look  Arteta reaction they communicate each other before come from bench
Arteta please buy arif aiman for backup bukayo saka
Would’ve liked to see the reaction to the Kovacic tackles
Finallllllllyyyy
SUPER TOMMMMMM‼︎‼︎  Pride of  the Japanese！
I can't wait to see the all access areas
So that goal was all Arteta's making, wow! We are blessed to have this guy
They had to include the Nutmeg 😂😂😂
COYG ❤❤

Man I actually prefer the Tunnel Cam format. It's so nice to see how players interact differently when theres no fans around. please bring back tunnel cam
One of the greatest moments in my life
What Arteta did was an extraordinary substitution.  3 key players determine victory ! Good Job !
Jesus❤❤❤❤❤
Arteta❤😊💪⚽
Trossard number 17 now? 😢
Success football My friend 😊❤
Pep what a guy I'm gland to have him in the premier league. My captain Ordegaard is always disappearing, not dropping into the midfield to pick and play the ball but I'm sure it's the coaches instructions.
Arsenal Forever~❤❤
6:51 THIS MOMENT! everyone literally realized that there was a glimpse of chance to score! Mikel Arteta raising his arms to notice Partey, Odegaard told Partey to came a little bit forward, Rice told Partey to pass it long to the space, Tomiyasu little glimpse to Foden and then running into the space, Havertz started running the exact same time Tomiyasu was running, Martinelli forced Walker to stay out wide, Ben White attracted City players to stay out wide on the other side. This state of play was pure brilliant coordinations and brilliant understanding of the tactics. GENIUS, ABSOLUTELY GENIUS!
Arsenal we love you
I've waited so long for coach to pass this exam! Well done, coach! Together.
🔥🔥🔥
Nice match
Kovacic red
What a substitution strategy🎉🎉🎉🎉
I can see rice passion there when talking to the coach after the goal🎉
❤️
Bench cam is just everything!!
I love the coaching staffs the way they are cooperating in the team ❤
7:03 OMG, it's so moving seeing it many times!! Glad to see the substitutes playing an active role!  そしてありがとうトミー！日本の誇りだぁ🇯🇵
01.45: G. Jesus didn’t pass to Odegaard 04.48: G. Jesus didn’t pass to Rice 06.38: G. Jesus didn’t pass again to Rice Then, his shot blocked….
Fifa gunners
this is one of the worst games man city has played in recent time you didnt play like man city and like gaduola team you allowd asenal play their game in this type of game dont follow them run and move in way they move you should have calm down slow them dowm and then play your gamebut then return to drawing board use the template of how you played and won man u 6,,,,,3 last season
so much sympathy for Rambo... you can tell he's frustrated
if you looking for goal... this time stamp will help you 6:53 (thank me later)
tomiyasu❤❤
That London forever at full time was something else 🥺
Arteta reaction same like mine.. Maybe one day i can become Arsenal manager.
I love Mikel's passion and dedication. I'm so happy that Arsenal are doing well. COYG A big fan from korea.
We have a epl contender team and a championship cf. Have always believe in Eddie but no more. Mm wonder if arteta has  assistant who spy on pep at the sideline giving fresh instructions....
STRIKER TOMI >
jesus just snub vieira 😂
Ben White's meg on Doku had Arteta stressing 8:00
Tomiyasu, Havertz, and Partey did the job really well. Super substitutions.
I rather a manager whos on the sideline living the game with you than one sitting back watching you
The fact that they felt like they've won the league is unbelievable
08:03 Pep was complaining of how was Benny Blanco allowed to nutmeg Doku that bad..!! 😂😂😂❤❤❤
Năm nay là năm không thể tốt hơn để các bạn vô địch ngoại hạng anh...cố lên các bạn...🎉🎉🎉
All the action and reaction but no clip from walker on tunnel 😂
When Mikel look dissapointed because we lose the ball, then Rice recovered it very well what an upgrade in our midfield
pep and mikel still love eachother
What a team
North london forever ❤🤍❤️🤍
The place literally goes silent before it goes in idk if they broke the sound barrier or not
WELL DONE GUNNERS let's keep moving forward✊
Tomi' is a secret class Act, just love his energy.  Wud love t c more of him on the pitch
So, how long do u thk Art an Pep will remain bromance buddies if this keeps up?
Whatever any1 outside Arsenal thinks , this win means the world t Arsenal cos imagine having a 6 yr weight on u shoulder which overruns everything u ever do only to finally have it removed; wouldn't U celebrate like youve won a billion £ lottery?
M-Arse-nelli,  M-Arse-nelli thank u. Emers-done an dusted by that real cool shot.
Love Arsenal, COYG
MY. FOGGIN. MANAGER!!!!!
COME OOOOOOONNNNNNNN!!!
Arteta has really brought Arsenal back. Time to get our hands on the real stuff!
I love my club 😤
I credit Partey more for this goal for his vision with that beauty of a long range pass. That game would be a draw without him on the pitch no cap.
6:52 Mikel asking Thomas Partey for a long direct ball and thats exactly what he did
Lucky win . Nketiah no starting line up
🔥
PGMOL bunch of cheats, we need to be talking more about it and hold them accountable.
The best part of this video is after the goal celebration you see MØ start jogging back to Arteta for instructions followed closely by Declan. The leadership qualities in this team are unbelievable.
Watching this video for the Arsenal goal against Manchester City, I realise that Partey's long range pass to Tomiyasu wasn't a fluke but very deliberate ( watch Arteta's reaction telling Partey to look up front).  Tomiyasu and Kai Havertz were meant to be in the box for the pass.  That was the instruction Arteta was communicating with the 3 guys when they were about to be introduced.  And, it works 👌
Anyone noticed whom Arteta goes to after Odeegard? As expected Declan Rice. I really like how lively, focused and how much a part of the game Arteta is. Its a different style that not all coaches do.
6:55 Martinelli scores and Arteta does a crazy celebration.
If any manager deserves a title, that manager is Arteta. His enthusiasm and passion is a joy to watch.
Did anyone notice that Arteta signalled for both Tomi's run and Partey's pass...like it was planned ???
I waited for this like for a century 😊
city need a bit more 'oil', they looking a bit rusty!
When Aretea call Odegaard that gonna end game😅
Partey knew City were expecting that switch to Martinelli on the touchline but Tomiyasu turned into an inverted 9 😂
I so much miss Martinelli 🥰🥰
I so much miss Martinelli 🥰🥰
Come on
Few mins of play partey was superb … calm the game and controlled it
Is that Samir Nasri on the left at 8:54
I love you Arsenal!😭😭😭❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Partey
How about that meg by Ben White on Doku. Brutal.
They must be so glad they stuck with him now.
This win is alone a big achievement then our entire last season, This win against city was the one thing that was the final level in the journey of the Mikel Arteta Era... I remember arsenal fans saying last season 'When do we start to believe', this.... this right here is the moment where  the Training Phase is over.... now we start to compete, now..we start to believe🔥🔥🔥COYG🔥
开心
Booooooo zinchenko. Free Palestine 🇵🇸
I love my club @arsenal 💥💥💥💪💪💪
Come on you gunners 🔴 💪 👏
Every single sub had a part on that goal. Love it
Class
omg it was a sensational game. Finally now is our time COYG 🔥⚪🔴💪
I do believe after watching this... that goal was planned in that way! Fantastic by Arteta and the lads! Love Martinelli, love Arsenal! Lets do this ❤❤❤❤❤
Arsenal forever
Was waiiiiiting for this!!!!
Arteta face when he seen Ben white nutmeg Doku 😂😂
Moments like these 💎💎❤
хотя-бы раз хочу побывать такой атмосфере ❤
Should include tunnel cam👍
What a boring match and a lucky deflection goal for Arsenal, unlucky City!
Why is Nketiah celebrating?
Great focus from Mr Arteta! Freaking over 3000 days in making.... awesome group of people! Gunner for life❤❤❤ very proud of this club. Arsenal
6:39 Kalvin Philips running to Arteta asking him to sign him up because he couldn’t get any minutes in Citeh
Crazy. Nobody knows why Mikel brought Tomi in to play as an attacking player until Tomi gave that pre-assist. They worked perfectly
Mikel feels every kick.  That bottle of  'Just for Men' hair dye getting a workout 😂 🔴⚪
My Gunner ❤4 life love my club 💙 ❤
2:39 You can see in the background Kovacic is explaining to teammates about his rash tackles
I don’t think some people agree with me but I think they should sell Ederson for some other keeper even tho he plays pretty good I don’t think he’s the level of the same team as Haaland and de brune  I’m of saying that Ederson is trash I’m just telling maybe they should sell or keep him in the bench and try looking for a class keeper
absolutely lucky win
All area access with my post admin plz
All area access with my post admin plz
Arteta got everything right this time round.  He outsmarted Pep for once.  Kudos GOONERS
Arteta cam lol
we are fogging winning the league guys
9:03 goosebumps
Great Team Performance gunners for ever 💪🔥
8:54 was that Samir Nasri?
I have now realized that whether Arsenal concede or score a goal Ordegard must consult from Arteta then simply means that this team is build around him in the pitch
See the way saliba dey great him players😅. Baba go just dey tap them for head 😭😭
Rice seems like Arteta's main 'vice captain'.
Give us extended highlights too😢
Martinelli....👌
Bernando Silva. Such a humble guy
Fair play to Bernardo for giving congratulations to,the victors - one or two City players need to follow his example and be humble if you lose
We want more atleast we can brag about everything 😂😂 the AAA,THE FAST FORWARD,AND MORE 😂😂😂😂
Every time we are inside the Box.... my eyes goes to Ode, and he is ALWAYS free for a pass... Bloody if this game had had Saka, he would have found him everytime. Jesus is a goal scorer, so obviously was looking at the goal and not towards the middle. Sigh..... Ode could have had two amazing and clear opportunities.
Our team literally reflects arteta . This is one of the calmest I’ve seen him on the whole and the team played with calmness the whole game
That ball from partey is sooo good. And the soft header from tommy is just as good
durasinya kurang lama min kalo bisa 2 minggu
We need extended highlights plz
Enthusiastic manager❤❤
That Noise.. City never heard it... even after a Trebble😂😂😂😂😂pity
6:53 Arteta already show sign the move they should make. Partey cross. Tomiyasu header. Havertz set up for Martinelli and Martinelli score. What a beauty.
Maldita sea se me metió una basura en el ojo!
COYG
the coolest moment of this is at 6:53 when he actually instructs Tomiyasu to bomb forward and it leads to the goal, 😍
9:49 who was that touching Jesus throat? That’s not viera is it?
What is the name of the song that the Arsenal fans sang after and before the match?
Nketiah ngapain ?????
i really want to see saka reaction to the goal
I have waited for this
I'm not even concentrating on the game ...more concentrated on the boss ...i love this Mikel guy❤❤
Been waiting for this 😋
Told You Mikel, Partey is our best Midfielder. You just won't Hear it
Blanco megsing Doku lol
❤ this Arsenal!
What a day and what a victory from the gunners. We actually beat Manchester City
Brooooo I'm PROUD!
Now give me Tunnel CAM and Dressing Room CAM
who the fk thinks of sending tomiyasu up front like a CF to lay it off like that xD.
Seru klo ada BENCH CAM sekalian ada pelatih ARTETA
Yeah we're not as explosive and fluid as last season, but this Arsenal is much more mature and controlled and therefore a much better team. And this is perhaps THE perfect example of that. COYG!
2:39
NKETIAAAAAAAAAG😂
Those fans have to be the best in the league right now.
Arteta's reaction to benny blanco nutmeg on doku is hahaha
The way Arteta signaled the attack was pure gold. A true definition of checkmate 😂
Way to Grind out the WIN, Gunners! Has anyone seen Haaland?
We deserved  this win and also security  our lives  are in danger  with  man u funs
i want to see more of the fan's reaction than mikel actually.
Boss you are doing well I love you ❤ b
Tomiyasu st hâhh
my manager mikel COYGGGGG
TOMIYASU!!!SUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
Success is sweet
Только только Арсенал всегда в моём сердце ❤️❤️❤️
Why didn't they include the reaction to the 2nd Kovacic challenge? Probably the gaffer said some things that would get him in trouble haha
Amamzing....I am still buzzing
Looks like a signal for a longball like a fieldgoal type signal. Tomiyasu even looked back to Mikel to see the signal.. Incredible.
We need a POV of Saliba’s and White’s pockets
Its so thrilling to watch this team play
I was hoping to see the City players throwing a strop at the end. Still don't know what actually happened, so all I can think of is that someone said something that ruffled their feathers?
Kovacic explaining 2:39
i love Arsenal...my Arsenal
How anyone can still be on the fence about Arteta is beyond me. Look at the state of the club when he took over. The squad was a joke. The atmosphere was toxic. Now, we have some of the best players in the world in our team.
Up the Arsenal .. One Nil to the Arsenal
Ramsdale and Arteta - no hugs at the end, even though they were close to each other. They didn't seem to acknowledge each other's presence. Ramsdale will probably not be with us this time next year.
This season we are breaking curses first Everton now city next is the cup 🙏🙏😍😂❤️❤️❤️😍😍❤️I love this club ❤️COYG
7:00 thank me later
It gave me goosebumps on my body when I heard North London Forever chant sang at the Emirates Stadium after Arsenal beat Manchester City. We've been suffering for a long time against them. Now, it's time to return the suffer we have gone through against them.
Goosebumps!!!
Amazing game loved everything but just one thing i wanted to nitpick, while Jesus is an amazing footballer i think he is too wasteful
W fans
yo good game
Ramsdale looked unhappy :(
Flamin Nora, arteta had a smile wider than Holloway Road at the final whistle. COYG
Huge goal set up by the 4 subs. Loving that captains huddle after the goal, Ødegaard Rice and the Boss
Waiting for AAA 🙏👁🙀😳🤣🥰
Qu'elle spectacle ❤
*Arteta Cam
I LOVE MY CLUB
8:54 notice narsi 😢
Play HAVERTZ/MARTINELLI/TROSSAR/JESUS in post CF ... please dont play NKETIAH !!!!!!!
8:53 Samir Nasri ? Between the coaches
I love this club
We're Arsenal, it's been a while before we experienced such vibes at the Emirates. Come on you gunners 💪
My score prediction is 0-0 draw. I'm happy to be wrong 🎉
I'm here 4 every second! That crowd going crazy was just how I was at my house! I couldn't believe my eyes when I seen the net bulge!
Arsenal are gonna have a Hollywood ending to the season
We love to see it, love Arteta's  passion on the sides it's thrilling seeing his reaction to the goal as well. Declan Rice is gonna learn that killer pass here I am sure of it, as much as he is a ball carrier I think he has shown that ability for the Martinelli chance.
Well done to all the Arsenal players and back room staff on this result.👍
It's easy to forget that Arteta worked under Guardiola before becoming Arsenal manager. He sure learnt well, and may soon surpass Pep.
I dont agree nketiah always starting line up
สุดยอดบอส❤
Hello fellow gooners how was the atmosphere in the stadium I was watching it from home and seem not as loud from the start but on this video seemed crazy!!
7:08 pep straight went home..🤣
Aaaahhhhh this match means a lot to this youthful team. I have watched the high lights an countable times.
All Access Area with lots of players shot in the tunnel is the best imo! I want to see players actioned inside the tunnel that we can't find anywhere to watch
Lovely
admit that everyone love the story how the ant killing elephant
The way Mikel’s fingers twitched when City almost scored 😂1:18  You can see how much cares about the team! COYG!!!
I love this videos i especially love this video but why do you have to put that spoiler at the beginning of these?
eddie eddie
My Manager, My Arsenal !!
COYG ❤
You could see City was wary of arsenal..another season and the team have matured..
I like the little flash close up replys of the game in the left corner. Good job editing, team. More like that, please!
Typical Arsenal! Celebrating a win by a defelcted goal like it was an overwhelming victory. It was a nailed on 0-0 until the big deflection. Just like the Spurs game; dubious penalty and a big deflection for the goal, and then bemoaning their bad luck in not winning. Arsenal are delusional if they think they are getting close to City . I'm not a City or Spurs fan by the way. One good season does not make the previous seven go away!
Les foggin go guysssss!
This is my team❤
ARTETA CAM
新しいCF冨安誕生👍️
🫡🫡🫡Thanks Arsenal..😊
Love bench cam
今年一番熱い得点シーンだったなぁ。
I've been waiting for Bench Cam. Still buzzing after the win. Come on Arsenal
super tom!!!!!  冨安最高！
A real team work, Arteta should trust on every single player otherwise we will get injuries in key players......It was an amazing team victory.
Đúng là ngôi sao trẻ của Brazil ghi bàn vào lưới thủ môn đẳng cấp Brazil..Martinneli giỏi lắm đánh bại được thủ môn xuất sắc nhất Brazil...
I​ Love​ You.​ Arsenal.❤
Tomiyasu-Partey-Havert-Martinelli  The best tactical substitution ever.
too many ads arsenal, sort it out
Bench Cam, my favourite video😍
Even they're pants and shoes were the same from both coaches. At least from this angle. They were similarities to mighty guy and rock lee from naruto, just with guardiola and arteta. If arteta has no hair too then it would've been even more hilarious I guess
Would love to have a timer in the corner within these clips - would be nice to see the tension building in relation to how much time is left and whatnot. 🙏🏼
Arsene gave us Emarate stadium and Mikel Arteta
anyone else realise the guy held up number 17 on the board instead of 19 lol
Note: 6:52 -> 7:02; Mikel Arteta is the Best
Ay the song's great but so many of yawl are off timed 😭💀no man.
Arteta deserves this. Arsenal deserves this. I deserve this🫡🫡🫡🫡🫡
doky getting megged by benny black is the best part about this game
🤍❤️💀🥶🥶
Home Victory 🎉
Congratulations to arsenal for winning the "we finally defeated an injury stricken city" trophy 🏆🥇🏆
Crying all over again. Bloody love this club
🤩🤩
Can we now normalize calling Arteta’s gameplan “Art football”
Class club with a class manager and class players. Excellent game managment and the players were awesome. COYG!!!
When Martinelli was coming on second half I could feel the atmosphere get tense 😂😂😂. City fans were like "Ohhh noooo".
Артета гений
Very Proud of This Great Team, COYG🔥♥️🤍
5:10… the rest is history.
Mikel Arteta is the best thing to have happened to this club. Thank you Arsene Wenger.
Welcome back Martin
A Brazilian scores to other Brazilian 😂 Martinelli VS Ederson 🎉
Love this cam ❤ Love Arteta masterclass ❤ COYG🔴⚪️

IN ARTETA WE TRUST

What a game !! ^^ 👏❤️❤️‍🔥
something’s cooking coyg
개까새끼들 부들부들하구나 아~ 즐겁구나 월요일 새벽이
I want Arteta to get Jakub Kiwior involved in the game. He is fast LB, He is technically gifted but with some confidence he will do what Zini is doing.
Absolutely love it
Martinelli is truly gem of a player. He was so aggressive and direct and caused absolute chaos. What we’ve been missing this season. We are so blessed to have Saka and Martinelli on either side. And they are still so young!
Nothing better than listening to the Emirates erupt 🥹🔴❤️
In all his years assisting at Man City, he never celebrated goals against Arsenal.. but, as Arsenal manager, he celebrates them against Man City.  Our donny Mr.M.Arteta
Clear red first time, clear second yellow.  Should be embarrassed by how pitiful the ref was.  Yet, arsenal still won.  Still need an inquiry and an apology like Liverpool got
This Team is Seriously lacking a Target Man to terrorise Defenders both at Home and Away, and be on the end of things. That's all The Arsenal needs to really Compete for the Major Honours. Bring in Ivan Toney to Compliment Raya. Rambo is a must to keep; a Young Quality Goalkeeper. Keep this entire squad in January. A back up Left Food Winger is needed also. Pedro Neto. Those 2 January signings are a must or else it's 2022/23 all over again.
This Bench Cam is so worth the wait! What a statement victory this game was. Kudos to our clever manager, hardworking players & backroom staff. What a relaxing interlull this is 😅
the bench cam you've been waiting for 🤗
Extended highlights request
I love rice … I just think he’s a massive reason why arsenal are more solid and compatible through the centre of the pitch. His engine and reading of the game is immense
8:52 anyone realise how much Samir Nasri's changed 🤣
Ben White doing the magic! What a team.
Can we just give credit to how nice tomi is to everyone.
I so wanted to see the handbags from Kyle Walker at the end. 😂 COYG!
5:23 the way Martinelli leaves them for dust there was magic
who else noticed arteta when ben white nutmegged doku😂
Reaction from Mikel Arteta when Ben White nutmegs Doku 8:00 😆
i always say how underrated Nelli is but not having Saka there i feel gives him the spotlight he deserves completely changed the game hes going to have a huge season trust me. Also imagine when we have both of them back on either side 🤣🤣Full strength we are a joke
Havertz asking for the ball !!! Things you love to see 😍
Did anyone notice Samir Nasri infront of City's bench at full time?
Good game, well done gunners!
Like I said before, Havertz will destroy Man city again.. Even though he didn't score, He assist..😎
Silva is a matured and humble baller!
Am tired of watching that goal, smells like Reiss Nelson 🥺🥺I love this team
The win was marginal, there were missed opportunities
Neto and valvoci 😊
What a great game! We had more highlights from the bench than we did from the pitch.
This team is a pressing monster
Good job Arteta and team
Ben White casually nutmegging Doku in the 90th minute had Arteta with his hands on his head looool.
am still buzzing
ARSENAL FOREVER
We need to defend this way for lens game.
2:27 look how Pep gestures waving his finger after this tackle, he knew it was red card worthy too
Good job Arteta and team
Still buzzing after that win. Bring on Chelsea
Good job Arteta and team
I'm more particular about the celebrations! Wished I was the fan hugging the players!
The Togetherness in the team and fans is something else ❤
Partey's long ball,Tomiasu dink header to Havertz's weighted pass to Martinelli-Tomiasu clears path-goal for Arsenal clean sheet! Bravo!
Brazilian footballers' are really Brazilian ones in the rain.
Good job coach and team
Arteta the great
Arsenal right person also have "A" word,Arsène Wenger > Mikel Arteta
Top fogging estandards!
Do you guys have the footage of the fans climbing up the stairs and down it after the game? I even want that too.
8:01 His reaction to Ben's nutmeg 😂
Great team effort. Saliba is a Goliath!
❤❤❤
Arteta and Guardiola look alike though
👏👏👏🎉
JESUS ACTUALLY NEEDS A  SERIOUS COMPETITIVE STRIKER. HE IS NOT CLINICAL MISSES ALOT OF OPPORTUNITIES & NKHETIA CAN'T EVEN CHALLENGE HIS SHADOW
Good JOb Boss and team
I almost had a tear in my eye at the full time whistle!
THATS MY TEAM!!! WHAT AN ATMOPSHERE!! One day I dream to be apart of it
2:24 Fraudiola signaling his buddy not to give a card to kovacic
God bless Bernardo Silva
Arteta needs to get out of them shoes and put his football boots back on. Mans a trooper.
we are so back
🥰
Heart beat always on 160 ❤
I like full full full
Gak bisa diem anteng ya, sepanjang pertandingan ngoceh mulu
4K Quality is BADLY needed for this beautiful moment!!! PLS give us 4K from now on!!!!!!!!!!
AAA is up next
Nooooorrrrrthhh loooondooooon foreveeeeer
Konsisten teruus Arsenal ku🔥🔥🔥
The reaction to Benny Blanco's nutmeg was all of us.
Some say that Ødegaard is still walking around the field  clapping his hands wit the fans in celebration of beating City
Anyone else see Samir Nasri in the background as Arteta and Pep were about shake hands at the end? Although seeing what i have just now read. He was there as a pundit and seeing that he got verbally abused. I mean i dont like the guy for what he did. But he is retired. Let the man retire and do his job in peace lol. Anyway great win for us and i cant wait for us to play Chelsea after the international break 😁😁. Cmon you gooners!! 🔴🔴🔴
Arteta is very passionate about Arsenal and his passion has obviously infected his players
Tears in my eyes, we did it when nobody believed we would, COYG❤️❤️❤️
I love bench cam… make it a permanent every match, carabao, ucl, pl and fa staple. I just love it.
amazing the momen
Nice 😊😊
from where weve come from, im so happy that this team are no pushovers anymore ...win lose or draw as arsenal fans we should back them to the very end and leave the negativity to rival fans. and to top it all off we are just getting started♥⚪
That Rendition of North London Forever after the game gave me the chills😊🥰
Absolutely huge win. The manager (Mikel) talking to Martin and Declan immediately after we scored shows what leaders they are for our club. To be so young - both only 24 - and taking on the responsibility to lead a big club like Arsenal is massive. When your best players also have exceptional leadership qualities success is sure to follow!
Now i see it: Mikel instructed the whole goal scenario in a single play to these substitutes. Tomi to go upfront, together with Kai to create channel and become two tower attackers. Kai also received well and knew what he was gonna do next cause Tomi attracts both foden and walker, Kai attracts both Ake, Gvardiol to him and then passed it to gabi who without any marking cause he knew gabi will go into the open space channel in front of these defenders that they left. Nothing fluke about this goal, it was orchestrated, build up and executed very good.
We need access all areas and fast forward too😅
Love these bench cams. especially when we see arteta talk to players giving them instructions. its actions like these that show me why i have so much faith in him as our manager. Especially when we went up he immediately spoke to odegaard/rice. Cut the celebrations short to focus on seeing the game out. love it
Wow!  Our Anthem 'North London Forever 'pre and post game,we appreciate you Gunners fans❤
This is the beginning of a winning streak
The benchcams  are ❤❤❤
North London forever❤❤❤
进球后，塔帅没有庆祝多长时间，因为塔知道比赛还没结束，并且面对的可是曼城，立马喊回厄德高和赖斯要稳住情绪，后面还有防守要做，知道终场哨响起，彻底的释放了。
How is nketiah still first 11..😢
Can't believe we have 2 weeks to celebrate 🎉 🥳 this wn 😂😂
Look at the bench after we scored. The coaches are all locked in. Great job Mikel and his team 🔥🔥🔥 7:51
06:51  Best scene
need a saliba cam
Score guy at 7:15 😂😂😂
Thanks admin, but please add all access arrears too
Give me the chills, oh how I love Arsenal!
I told everyone to stop the distractions and let arteta cook, i told y'all just sheeeesh and watch him cook
Without realizing it, Arsenal's goal process was carried out by 4 substitute players, Partney passed to Tomi then passed to Harvest and ended with Martineli's kick and goal.
Nice bit of skill from Ben White there
9:03 gives me chills… this stadium is becoming our fortress.
Epic win. COYG
Damn did not notice how many times Jesus had the chance to square it to rice in the box.
We all love you, ARTETA 💕
You boys are proper gladiators.COYG
I love bench cam❤
6:52 , Arteta already knew. Match of details.
Odegaard and Rice are the leaders for sure, Arteta speaking to them right after the goal shows it!
Im crying
This squad’s broken two curses so far this season 👊 Trust the process, indeed ❤️🤍
Is that Samir Nasri holding mic at final whistle?
What a game. We learnt from our last thrashing. We didn't overly press and allow them to play long balls to our half. We kept all of their players in check. There's more where this came from. COYG!
Wooow Arsenal for this season Bukayo saka injury ❤
🤍♥️🔥
Jesus not playing well as a winger.... Change him to striker.. Start with martinelli and trossard
London is red❤
lha iki arsenal menang tenan
My MoM is whitey...❤
He interacted throughout the match with the players. What an enthusiastic person who thirsts for titles. Vamos Mikel
When Ben megged Doku Arteta wiped his face in disbelief
What an atmosphere, what a win. Coyg!
The SILENCE just before the ball hits the net then the roar from the crowd is beautiful! COYGGGGG!!!!!!
@8:04 that Ben white nutmeg on Doku stressed out Arteta
that smirk on 6:53....Arteta planned the move all along and he knew it would result in a goal...absolutely brilliant.
7:02 ❗❗❗
Mikel’s reaction to Ben’s nutmeg😂
8 Damn years curse Broken.... Gunners forever 💪💪💪
Pinch me, I must be dreaming… 1 nil to The Arsenal!
最高だった！！ みんなで勝ち取った勝ち点3。 冨安もよくやってくれたよ！ありがとう！！！
"Take nothing less, not even second best, you can pass the test"! Love hearing " Move On Up" at the end of the game,  inspirational lyrics from one of the freshest tracks ever made! COYG 🔴⚪️💪
Please give us the access to all areas next
Come on you gunners
At 08:58 saliba to haaland: Do better next time kid.....now go cry to ur spanisg daddy.
Man they must have practiced that Tomi run in training. 🏆🏆
Love it ❤
They thought we're going to be push over but it wasnt. Im so happy for the win is such a morale boost for us
Tomiyasu 😊😊😊😊😊😊
Was there a camera in Saliba's pocket by any chance
Arsenal has nothing to cheer about. First, Ake missed a sitter and then scored an own goal through deflection. The return game will tell
Glad we got to play an easy team like City to get back to winning ways before the break after losing to one of the best teams of all time in Lens.
Trận này 41 chơi wa ấn tượng
Broke Ake's nose 😅
Martinelli is the best,, start boy
สุดตรีนน💪
Did anyone notice the amount of instructions passed on to the players by the coaching staff after the goal.  Wow, this is a Super team. The aim is to win the league this season and other titles. This team deserves to win titles this season.
The good thing is that we can now give saka a 2 weeks rest. Need our star boy fit💪
The gunners have won the league hurry 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Nahh I feel sorry for Ramsdale I feel like dropping a tear.
I'm only one gooners from Timor Leste.
What a time to be an Arsenal Fan.. 😂
Am I the only one saw no 17 instead of 19 displayed when gabi comes on
GJ should learn to shoot the ball to the net , not dribble dribbling. He should learn from GM
Parteys pass is underrated 😮
Great atmosphere, surely i will be in the stadium watching lads playing someday
COYG ♥️🤍
Edan arsenal🎉❤
Vamosss!!!
Extended highlights of matchday pls
Love a bit of bench cam
You can see before the goal, Arteta instructing Tomi to go long and when Partey had the ball, Arteta was signaling him to pass long. Proper Maestro! 👏 👏 👏
❤❤❤🎉🎉🤙🤙🤙
even mikel was shocked by benny's filthy meg😂😂
love the extended version bench cam, of course beating city needs longer version
Lovely ❤
These highlights are better than the official match highlights
What a glorious ending with the London Forever!

I Can Do This All Day.
Still absolutely buzzing after that win! Not only did we finally end the hoodoo. We managed to keep a Clean sheet, keep Haaland quiet and restrict them to just 4 shots on goal. That Defence was special and the subs worked a treat 🔴⚪🔥
❤❤❤ This is our togetherness   ❤❤❤ THIS is our ARSENAL
Finally!!!! The Bench Cam isn't enough though. We need Access All Areas, Fast Forward and Operation Save Haaland From Saliba's Pocket 👀 More needed!!
Need a crowd cam, i wanna see myself!
Let's goo!
