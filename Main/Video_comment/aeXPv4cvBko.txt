Amen and Ausar can switch teams without us even knowing
Who else come back here bc tonight will be the 2025 nba draft?👀🖐🏼
Let’s go Thompson brothers!
Victor Wembanyama publicly expressed a strong desire to play for the San Antonio Spurs during the predraft process.  And then boom!  Spurs “win” the number one pick.  😂😂😂😂

Why were people saying Brandon Miller was a bad pick? HES A BETTER PICK THAN SCOOT!!! HES DESTROYING.
The Detroit picktons 😂 congrats to everybody they got drafted

The crowd is so dead compared to pre Covid drafts
Bryce young alabama,  Brandon miller alabama???
9:35
Who would win in a 1v1 Lebron or victor wembinyama
I think one of the best drafts was the spurs with wemby
Victor Wembanyama Fans   👇
man triple j is such a steal for miami !
where is the other draft, why do I only see Jaquez and Wemby playing in this NBA season 😂😂
Hawkins the steal of the draft fr
i didn’t see Chet holmgreen
Vaszquez and Podziemski were back to back steals
Ghetto draft class 😂😂😂
Now it's your time to get dunked on by Lebron 😂
Jaime pick 18🤔
Now we head for the draft of 2024
JJJ at 18pick a steal
The most productive player out this draft is Jamie jr and it’s not close
The Warriors came out ahead in this draft.
I am happy for all players
Def best draft class overall since 2018
#18 has proven he's a gold mine.
What’s sad is half the good ones got drafted to the worst team💀
This is one of the deepest draft classes in nba history
spurs take a big step in their basketball level! GL
So emotional lol so happy for all of these young men
Scoot, brandon and wemby are incredible.
Algún día, estare ahí.......
Jaime jaquez now top 2 in this draft  1 wemby 2 Jaime
We'll see if this ages well but Jaime Jaquez Jr. is the steal of the draft and Scoot Henderson is a Bust
Are the freemasons purposely breeding tall people to create more nephlim babies? 🤔
Im next yall.
Gs
love wemby outfit no excessive jewelry just clean and sleek suit.
8:50
Nba needs to get rid of draft protection. It increases tanking
Why would Detroit draft a point guard after getting the PG Cunningham with the first overall pick last year
People sleeping on black,,, lively and whitehead the duke  two are gonna be a problem and the two biggest steals along with the kid from Nova

These are kids that get their first shot at the big league and they are already out there wearing ridiculous stuff, iced out jewelry...
Anthony black over here looking like a strong, independent businesswoman that don’t need no man
Such a great side hustle, this nba.

Whats up! NBA!

Wemby 🇨🇩🇨🇩
Harden was draining 3s when he was getting triple doubles ober and oebr.
The nba commisioner is a weirdo.

Scoot Henderson and Grady Dick suits. Yikes 😬
what’s with the outfits?
To bad all Johnny C can do, sure can't win a championship!! Been another wildcat coach done been put on the road.
I informed everyone in the nba team, is this from the spurs team, victor wembayama, you are proud of being the number 1 pick, it's funny, you don't even know how to shoot the ball beyond 3 points, we're still good Philippines 🇵🇭 palayers prospect kai sotto 7'3 foot players in orlando magic my shotting on the ball and good in defense you guys are funny I'm still with you get kai sotto in orlando magic tomorrow kai sotto will play watch kai tomorrow
Scoot finna destroy
the fact that Terquavion Smith from NC State did not get drafted is a joke. He should have been a lottery pick. Another Cam Thomas and Jalen Brunson.
Wemby gonna be the new Tim Duncan ❤
Lot of great talent and great potential on this years 🎉
I like the Thompson  brothers even Saar thompson
So many potentials
Every players selected in the NBA is the biggest achievement of their parents, good luck all young guns.

What about kai sotto?
Adónde están los team blazer y Atlanta🏀
my cousin got drafted!
Damn he tall
Now it makes sense why Dame asked to be traded. It's not going to work with young fast Scoot. Older players usually get more methodical, and cerebral slow the game down. Young players don't recognize that pace until they get older
Who got drafted to the Denver nuggets?
NBA when are we gonna bronny james
wemby bulk yourself up
😮😮😮😮
He's too lanky 😂 Victor. If he puts on muscles its over for everyone. Blocks, steals, buckets
President Agt Knoxville TN Finalist Frederick Johnson Jr of little rock Arkansas salute Innovative Victor Webanyama
Wembanyama is going to be one or one or the greatest basket player of all time
dayum imma look out to see how good they become in the next few yrs from now

Why NBA are racist against wihite players?
“The greatest prospect “ ?? Lmao stop it
Waiting for Jordan Pickford to get drafted
🏀🏀Congratulations Young Men!🏀🏀
Best suits in nba draft so far  Congratulations to y'all 🎉

Jaques ❤️ 🇲🇽
Let see wemba lets goooo
Lifeless hugs! WTF?????
🦾🦾
I love what KD had to say about Victor -  "The NBA is going to be in trouble"
Lebron James was the greatest hype to hit the NBA, not him
Sotto until now is egg..
Saan na si Sotto?
Wembemyama better get some muscle fast before he gets bullied hard in the league
2:00 miller tries to put the button on and fails😂😂

He is overrated. Let’s see what he can do in the NBA.
Grady Dick has a look that follows a great personality. I can see myself following his career
I love these draft picks success success success to you all
im not racist but there are somethings wrong that why there are no white kids ?
I will never watch the NBA Draft again after what Malika Andrews pulled! Did the NBA run out of Hall of Famers or former players who can cover the draft. #NBA is making a huge mistake in it's current path, tell ESPN no more tearing down young men who haven't committed a crime. No more Malika as she is bad for all sports brands.
Spurs will rise again
I am spurs supporter right know
3:54 naw that was the worst misspell i ever heard😭😭
You have to say your brother is better than if he got drafted first
The Detroit picktens 😂😂😂😂
he said the detroit picktons
Great class 🏀🏀🏀🏀🏀🏀🏀🏀
I will be ready for 2026:  youtube.com/nfabamane
Vamos Jacques !!!
Brandon Miller and Lamelo Ball is a force in the future.
Detroit picstons
Abangan ko to.
Hahahha watch and learn
Sana makoha se soto
C Soto Nakoha kaya
How tf it skipped from scoot to someone else without the intro what kinda shit is this
I’m happy
In 10 games he will get injured thats it.
Greatest prospect??????? This lady needs to be commentating cricket.
International players are slowly  taking over the top spots in the NBA .
Vicky going to be a bust l😅
Fire Malika Andrews, her repugnant victim ass can kick rocks, not appealing.
No Kai sotto name ..always press release to play in nba
how manny whites? hope enough diversity
ano na kai sotto 😂
7'5 victor wembanyama😯
Victor’s arms thoe
When did the NBA become dancing with the stars?  Who is tasked with sweeping up the sequins after this show?
Twins!😮
bruh warriors aint get no picks
1:15 minutes
Vamos como le va en la nba, por qué el juega muy bien pero , la nba valga la redundancia hay personas más experimentados, el está comenzando
Anybody else kinda jealous 😢
Why did they skip arguably the best pick in the draft in Amen Thompson? I see you cooking NBA🧐🤔
Number 3 draft is always my best
Victor you really do deserve it ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
we will go back to this video in a couple years and realise that this draft class is the greatest all time.
Congratulation. Good luck and ball out!!🇮🇳
Brandon Miller is the athlete that will flourish the most in this draft.  Wemby is too tall. Scoot is short.  7-4 and 6-2 players haven't had much success in this league
Piscins
Congrats
When it comes to mathematical anomalies, how is it possible a single franchise over a single coaching span is able to land David Robinson, Tim Duncan, AND Victor Wembanyama?  Is the NBA playing us for a fool? It’s obvious the lotto process is rigged.
Where is Phoenix' pick? Oh, wait..
I LIKE PHILADELPHIA 75ERS
Idiot for you
Victor is soooo damn tall man i cant believe it
2:28 scoots devilish look when he got picked…
Wow nice NBA YoungBoy
Sa draft my bias sempre kalahi ang kukunin
The Toronto Raptors select Drake Great Dick!
They all suck
Nahhh lebron was the best first pick prospect
Tall as fuk
Yes Wembanyama my favorite player..go spurs
Is it just me or since all of the picks have family in the nba or associated with the nba and it feels like an endless cycle 🔄 of sacrifices of nba players and there sons so the script stays the same, stays in the family, yeah they work hard and play ball 🏀 but that’s just the thing they work to get to the nba and then get payed to play the script the ones before them had too. You’re either in or out and all of them have to sacrifice a family member. Always 😢
Terrible video editer,just fired them.
This is a hard Draft to call because almost all of the Freshmen class that came into College Basketball struggled for one reason or another and the Wembeyama guy looks good however I don't see the "greatest prospect" to ever enter into the NBA hype when his numbers in the league he played in wasn't really eye popping. Even the guys from the NBA developmental leagues numbers weren't really that impressive. It will take about 8 to 10 years to fully judge this class but I hope they all find success in the league and outside of the league for those that don't make it in the NBA.
Go huskies
Upcoming big three of the Spurs to lead and win the rings again🙂
If Portland got the 1st pick Wemby could have been Greg Oden 2.0. If Charlotte got 1st pick Wemby could have been Cody Zeller 2.0. NBA made sure Wemby go to the Spurs
I’m so surprised for the lakers
Grady Dick should have chosen something else to wear lol
I know im getting old i don't know none of these ninjas
Almost all are either black or mixed with black...
Congrats to Brandon Miller for getting selected by the hornets! Also congrats to Nick Smith Jr and the other players who’ve been selected in the draft and by the hornets
As much as I want Wembanyama to yield a lot of positive contributions in the league, it seems like he will eventually become injury-prone simply because having a skinny frame body while being a very tall active player might exert influence on him and Brandon Miller as well. My impression is that Scoot Henderson will be the only preeminent among the Top 3 overall picks.
Most of them are black, why a lot of stupid ppl keep saying systematic racism?😂
No Jordan Haber😡
Champion-ship/ GO SPURS GO /
This dude is tall as fuck
Well see  wemba😂
I know that Ja can't wait to dunk on Wemby. ✌️😁
Detroit pictin 💀
Congratulations to these men that worked so hard to get to where they are! Good luck and ball out!! 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Congratulations 🎉 to all new talented
“greatest prospect” hahaha Can’t wait to see what that height can do in the league even though NBA is soft nowadays lol
the most exciting player here is Greedy Dick, I am looking forward and rooting for this guy...
Mark my words Anthony Black will win Rookie of the Year he’ll definitely be a star in this league
This is the best draft so far from Lebron draft class.
Coots dad look like Shaggy hahaha..mr bombastic
Put on 5 pounds he'll be good
So great seeing young men change their lives for the good and take a step into self improvement and inspire those around them
ALL DRAFTED COMING FROM AFRICA AND SOMALIA
FIRST ROUND PICK ALL FROM SOMALIA HAHAHAHA
BLACK AMERICAN DRAFTED ALL LOUSY
WEMBAYAMA LOUSY
(yawn)
i alway created a player 7 foot shoot 3 shot blocker and fast...in nba video games
kai sotti nathing
In all honesty stop disrespecting the other prospects put their draft clips as long as that #1 pick
01:30 Wow Adam Silver is tall, I think 6' 5" or so, but look at the disparity.
When Memphis picks no special just ignored
Victor can't skip Leg Day with Giannis and Lebron on the floor not mentioning the rascal players like Patbev, Grayson Allen etc.💀
for #1 pick select by Terra Firma (pba) KAI SOTTO
Grady Dick looks like Kid Laroi
No kai sotto?
I need to see Jordan Haber on here (:
NEXT GEN PLAYERS😂..real life
NO WAY..Thie UConn Center Sanogo  went Undrafted.. Dude should've been a Top 10 Pick.. SMDH
where is the diversity? where is lgbtq+ representation? shame
Kay sotto
Good luck wemba 😂
bahahahahahahah "FROM LANSING TO THE LEAGUE" BAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA poor woman comentator does not even know about the deep RIVALRY BETWEEN MICH ST - LANSING AND MICHIGAN - ANN ARBOUR
Adam silver it happens to all of us when we stutter it just shows your human to
농구선수들도 다 난장이로 만들어 버리네. ㄷㄷㄷ
Yay we got a new Rockies for rockets 🥰... This season is ours..
the question is it make a ring
Flop!
Webanyama not the greatest prospect because hes not strong enough. Hear me out now. This comment should age well.
Can't wait for wenbanyama to be posterized 😊😊
Some lives were made this day at the draft happy for all the most hard working athletes shoutout
Very happy for Lively to OKC.. His story is just an inspiration... I hope he was drafted by the Heat. 😊 But it's just me. Congratulations. 🎉
The best twin now in nba😮
Bro mans name is Grady Dick.
EVERYONE IS SO YOUNG LIKE 18+  I THINK THIS BASKETBALL IS GOING TO BE BEASTMODE..  "THIS IS THE NEW GENERATION OF BASKETBALL" ITS FEELS  LIKE IM WATCHING SOME REALIASTIC ANIME BASKETBALL <3
Get ready for bronny James to go number 1 I believe he is a freshman right
Brandon Miller going Charlotte as Michael Jordan is selling the team to someone else
The Detroit Picktons Select
He can be the next Lebron James or the next Sam Bowie
Can we get rid of Malika Andrews 🤦‍♂️
fuckin hell dude, wemby is so fucking tall. Like everytime I see him, I have to say it
Maybe next years, the Champions of NBA must first draft pick
Almost cried when the Thompson twins were picked back to back… such a blessing - wish them nothing but success, they look like humble dudes!
Why did dallas trade Cason Wallace the best 2 way player in the draft he is from Dallas like bro lol ifk man I'm starting to think it's mark cuban
congratulations to the man who betted 400k
Scoot needs to burn that suit
Kai Sotto
Raptors be like:  "WE GOT THE D!"
I HAVE NEVER ONCE IN MY LIFE SEEN A REFF CALL TRAVELING IN THE NBA ! ITS  LIKE THEIR SCARED , THREE STEPS VOIDS YOUR POINT YOU CANT RUN   WITH THE BALL , FOR 60 MILLION MATH IS NOT YOUR STRONG POINT !
🎉Congrats lodi!
Finaly bye bye dame??
Grady dick suit is legit❤
Them Suits 💯
Cam whitmore at number 20? A lot of people are going to lose their jobs.
Gradey Dick has a very hot mother.
Congrats Kai sotto😅
The spurs conspiracy
Nba trying hard to get a new face when bron finally retires
I think he can never be great 😂
How tf scoot ain’t go #2 woooooow
Dis man 7’4 and can shoot threes
Over hyped
🏀
I can't stand that ESPN tries to compare lebron and victor, nothing at all lebron has ever done can touch what victor is gonna do or what he's done so far.  Lebron is nothing to what victor will be at any age.
where is kai sotto
His suit actually fits.
Wow man the spurs were so trash and random now look
Not the pictons😂
I want Victor Wembanyama to be ELITE! I want Brandon Miller to shine! I want Scoot to ball hard as H! I want the twins to win! I want these kids to have great careers, man.
I think#1 pick gono be bust???
Guys cheer for victor wenbanyama I’ll start  🎉GO VICTOR WENBANYAMA🎉
Finally now i can say this man name without being wrong
It's 7 feet 5 not 7,4
Congratulations to all the talented individuals who were selected in the NBA draft! Your hard work, dedication, and passion for the game have paid off. 🔥🏀 Wishing you all the best as you embark on this exciting new chapter of your basketball careers.🔥
Damn the NBA ads go hard.
It's  funny how most of the team hats don't fit on the draftees heads.
5:04 that line killed me 😂
It’s seriously crazy how tall he is compared to the rest
Glad to see we got new players! I can’t wait to see them on the court! It’s awesome to see them accomplish their dreams.
Victors arrival is the first step, in 2/3 years other great players will arrive and then the spurs will target the nba finals :) parker is the best french player ever but wemby might replace him at the end of his career... thats the best i can wish to the spurs and to the french basket fans :)
Wembenyama lucky that maleka did not air his dirty laundry
My phone crashed watching this video for some reason
As a Raptor fan I wasn’t expecting that at all. 😅Mr.Dick
Hornets fans are going to realise how disrespectful it was booing Brandon Miller and comparing him to Scoot. - 6'9 - Can play SG and SF - Can handle the ball and bring it up - Great tempo to his game - Knockdowns open shots like crazy and will space the floor like crazy alongside Melo (who also greens open shots) - Great shooter all around, very quick release - Athletic and can rebound well - Athleticism and length makes him a good defender and shot blocker - Complements LaMelo's game, will have a constructive on-court relationship not a destructive one (like Melo x Scoot would be) - Paul George re-gen  What is the use-case of Scoot over Miller?? There isn't one.  Clear and obvious good pick by Charlotte at 2.  Drafted for fit AND best available talent.
Thompson twins will be the biggest bust of the last five years they play against high school kids and they are 20. How are they NBA players
Disappointments
Congratulations 👏👏👏 to the Howard Family!!!
One Twin in the East, Detroit Pistons and the other goes West under Ime Udoka's tutorial! Houston Rockets 😮
Twin back to back, Wow 😮
Why change teams midway through? what's the point of wearing a hat
Ça y est il l'a fait , le premier français de l'histoire a être drafté en première position ! Ce joueur a de très bonnes années devant lui , avec le coach des spurs il va dominer la ligue !
Stop saying "the greatest prospect to EVER walk across the stage". Are y'all forgetting Kareem, Lebron??
Www
Bro bouta touch them millions 😏
Malika Andres on every pick - "so emotional"
San Antonio Spurs are going all the way
First 3 picks then a bunch of randoms we legit dont know
That means bol should get more of a chance to play he literally avg around the same numbers as Victor when he was in Oregon , wemby was 21 pts 10rebs & 3 blks & bol bol avg 21 pts 9.6 Rebs & 2.7 blks pg
The Greatest Prospect?
muy bien trabajo https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUH-ld6_qOy9jTBTTqljQ7Q
It’s really like a movie
congrats to the boys a very special moment indeed
He's possibly the greatest prospect to ever walk across this stage" SHUT UP LADY

What happen to hair cuts.😅😅
Who's gonna be the BUST 😂😂😂

Fu*k this bend the knee to the wokebrokebackchokesondicks league. Where are the radical muslim truck bombers when you need one ?😂😂😂
its crazy how everyone has the same haircut these days
Not alot of over sees players this year.
Wembanyama🇨🇩🇫🇷🇨🇩🇫🇷
They gave it to the tallest guy in the room. Not surprised 😅
Interesting how there are two Kobes in this draft with both of them coming after a Jordan. One of them was drafted right after the Jordan. 🤔
Does anyone notice the best styles these players have? Love the suits and congratulations!
bp
I wonder who got picked during the Taco Bell Commercial this time round.
Hopefully not another Sam bowe 😅😅😅😅
Victor Wembanyama has to win a ring
Bro wemby is literally a giant wtf
Special moment by the bros, you can tell Ausar was holding back tears watching Amen get selected.
he really said detroit pictons 💀
This draft is crazy deep, even the 2nd round got a lot of studs such as Leonard Miller, Rayan Rupert, Maxwell Lewis, Emoni Bates, Trayce Jackson-Davis ect…
Victor WhamboomBadabang 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Boy better get the muscle milk!!!!!!!!!
Glad to see a fellow classmate get drafted. Congrats Key
detroit picktons
Detroit picktons lol
It's a lottery but their outfits fit the team color schemes?😅
Utah Jazz got it's Keynote 😅
Bro said pictons💀💀
hopefully injuries wont kill these kids carrerr
Did liangelo ball get drafted?
I am just hoping Victor will be not another Chet but I have doubts.
Jay-Z, Nipsey Hussle, and Ja Rule had made into the league one after another in this draft.
Bronny James waiting 💪💪💪
Way to skip the Rockets 4th Pick.. TRASH
victor is an injury prone player
Number 1 pick alwys injury🤣🤣🤣ampaw
Kai sotto
The nba really don’t like Brandon miller because of the gun case u see how fast they cut his pick
goood job
Good luck to all playing NBA
Brandon miller welcome to basketball mediocrity
I think he's the next King LBJ 🏀👑 Or brony will
Would you imagine if san antonio didn't take wembanyama that would've been funny
Everytime I see these 7'footers I just think of all the bball players who could of been legends if they were just tall but never even made it to the NBA as normal height human
I would be really happy if the nets commented on this video
You know how I'm coming it's DukeNation until the casket drops
I'm just glad there are some guys that I have no idea about in this draft!!!
I still feel like it’s messed up they let all the trash teams get the top picks lol kinda takes away the excitement of getting drafted for the players m becomes about the money
Congratulations to the new NBA Stars 🌟
This draft is kinda garbage
It's always #DukeaNation where ever we are at !!!
Impatient to see what wemby and the Thompson brothers are going to cook this year 💯
7'4 wow
3:50 😅😅 "pictons"

2:48  My favorite part of this draft.
Oakland stand up!!
Victor wenbayama the next tony parker fr
No Kai Sotto in NBA.
the 21 pick was the most likeable
💀💀💀
Biggest bust Draft in NBA history. Predicting massive Wemby injury in year 1. Vs the Dallas Mavericks, you heard it here first
With the 20th pick in the 2023 nba draft the Miami heat select flavor flav!
Why were some of the guys not included in here? Were they not in attendance or the video just didn't include their footage?
A Benchwarmer going 11th?? Daddy had to be paying off the NBA
What's up with all the huge hair doo's.They going to have to get rid of the hat requirement cause you can't see'm 😂😂😂😂
This is an absolute joke of an organization
Victor going to be a bust
When did long hair come back?
NBA Draft was a thing of beauty that’s all in the pass…look at todays NBA DRAFT ESPN showcase wokeness. Black female lead host everything has changed due to catering young millennials
These players seem a little tall to have any real success in the batters box.  The strike zone will definitely need adjustment to compensate.
The best success is enjoying your career sharing it with the people that got U there and staying out of trouble. Don’t let success and money mess your career up.
He ain't finna dominant as a big but let's hope spurs do right
Wishing all these young athletes the best stay focus and stay out of trouble
Fuck you nba
14:22 jack harlow went from a movie to the league!!!
So why did they cut some of these picks, is it because they are not important or is it because they didn't show up.
Hornets gonna regret passing up on Scoot
I was expecting Malika Andrews to bring up some dirt on each player as they were drafted..lol. guess she's not hating right now
I'm a big warriors fan and this is the best draft class
Half expecting from see sheep owens as the 19th pick
rockets won
And that plant that clown that's the number one pick is not the greatest prospect that ever came across that stage this is why women shouldn't be commentating on Sports what is she even talkin about. When the real competition come in we'll see how his body hold up
How many of them family and parents came from America that's what I want to know I guarantee you it's probably only less-than- 4
Wembey wont play 65 games this year let alone 82.
Wembumyama will be another Ralph Sampson or at best another Porzingus.
Miller is another Bagley.
why would dame leave right?🤷🏽‍♂️
cam whitmore 20th pick?
Maybe Dame Been Waiting for Scoot???? Lmao If I was A GM I woulda Took bro #1
Wemby
how are they gonna talk about athletic point guards of this generation and leave out John Wall...?
SOME OF THOSE OUTFITS ARE CRAZY CUZ WIT THE RED JACKET AND SHIRT TO MATCH GOING TO TORONTO RAPTORS LOOK LIKE DANCING WIT THE STARS
Wemby gonna be an all star in his rookie season
How tf did victor get a suit?
I like third pick  then victor  bcus
Spurs are back watch out NBA ...... we're back ..
Yup dame is going to Miami
These guys are gonna run the league in a few years especially those first 20 picks
Let’s go Jazz we had a good draft

Shocked by anthony black going so high, he was a big kid who can't shoot.. There's alot of those around!😂
His is about too change the Game 7 foot plus guard skills the game is about too change watch hello New NBA people 🎉🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤

God bless everyone who was drafted last night. Also god bless those who went undrafted. May good blees all of you during your Journey. Xup!
This dude has good energy
First pick Dude already looks injury prone.  Noodle arms lol
Bring Back the Supersonics!
Guys you have to go to 9:36
The West suddenly got way stronger because of this draft overall, I mean let's be honest, when you see how portland, the spurs, the rockets, the jazz drafted, there is no discussion.
Greatest Prospect?
Whoo
Who made this shit skipping names 😂😂
Victor!!!
congrats but he is not the greatest prospect stop saying that bs
Victor wembanyama
We can understand the pride of the families of these young men...it's not easy to be there...4:00 the mother of the Thompson twins couldn't be more proud...
Bro got away with murder and pulled up with a chain. He did it guilty af
You just knew a Fench dude would be 💯 on with the suit...famn. 🤟🎯
Seeing these guys achieve their ultimate goal is enough to make a grown man cry.
Can’t wait to see wemby out there
He said Detroit Pitons lol
Pray to got victor doesn’t get injured. Hope the best.
lol 90% of the selected players have the same haircut, take a change bro be original
it seemed like the Pacers had half the picks.
Yall seen the green dress and white dress tryin make eye contact with victor all they seen was money as he walked past
The nba is racist. Drew Timmie undrafted ? Best player last year. So much for white privileged ? #1 pick too skinny , next porzingus at most. #2 pick involved in criminal behavior. Most will be busts ! I see why Jokic was picked #41 ? How many busts picked ahead of him. My Bulls passed on him twice  and no player the last five years ,on Bulls is better than overlooked Jokic. Why I no longer watch racist nba, only ncaa . Btw , the best player picked is Jaquez because of team Miami where no pressure as allowed to progress with excellent teammates . Wembyama had enormous pressure to fill Duncan and Admirals shoes , feel for him. Adraya Carter knows nothing about basketball calling JJ Reddick an average shooter !
Watching the NbA Draft in the previous past was a thing of beauty but now draft gone woke ESPN gone woke
Sheesh
NBA Draft gone woke…female taking over the desk…ESPN gone woke with black female lead host doing NBA Draft coverage
This is a great draft class my goodness! I feel like years from now people will be talking about this draft!
Gradey Dick, whatta name
Bilal Koulibaly is up there with Emmanuel Ginobeily
Brandon Miller 💯
Shout out to Adam puttin a little umph on that THE Ohio State University https://youtu.be/aeXPv4cvBko?t=1121
I cant believe Micheal Jackson was the 3rd pick of 2023
Jaime Jaquez!!! 🔥🔥🔥
damn after wembenyama all of them look small……I think it will be an era for big centers again….
Top 5 went perfectly either way with the twins for me though
I can't believe Cam whitmore fell to 20 he a steal
I love the Detroit Picktons!
Can’t believe Spurs took Victor Wenbanyama for the first pick. He’s an underrated gem and I don’t see anyone talking about him at all
They really skipped Amen thompson’s name call 💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
Scoot and wemby get to still battle each other in the west, i can't fuckin wait... idk any of these kids tho 😭
I don't know, the 1st rounder looks a little fragile to me......I hope they can strengthen up a little....he appears too not be a Tim Duncan or David Robinson, but we will see....those guys were sturdy and super strong.....this dude looks like a long wet noodle.....
Detroit Pictons got me dead
Scoot henderson..ang wembanyama..best among them..
Best draft class 🔥
where the music before the draft name? miss those chimes
3:53 LMAO the Detroit Picktons 😂
Scott Henderson rookie of the year
thompson twins the 2nd brothers to be top5 pick in nba history
Jordan Hawkins was a stealllll
Kai sotto last pick
Rien que des blacks
Gs to dame hes final get help
I had the same feeling with the 2015 class and well, I was wrong 😅
Man lakers messed up we needed victor! 🤦🏾🤦🏾🤦🏾🤦🏾
They hyping victor too much.
"I got drafted first bro" that will sting for the rest of his life 😂
what happened to mikey
The worst TV conductance of the draft ever. No anticipation, because too busy talking. Analyst, families,.. talking and talking. I watch to hear the commissioner announce names.
Not happening. He’ll be a huge bust. Trust me. 😂
GREEDY DICK is one of the best shooter in the draft aside from that he is the hardest and strongest dick ever
This draft was weeeeaaakkkk
Man who didn’t know that victor was going to get drafted by the spurs
He wont last long!
NBA is no different than  the WWE at this point.
Where's Kai
Let’s go Kobe brown 😈
MARK MY COMMENT---Victor Will Be A Bust...Bust
The magic just drafted Side Show Bob 😂
9:32 that jersey might become a best seller
The comment about Scoot not "necessarily"needing to develop his three is crazy.
For 10 years now,1rst picks don't even worth anything... I'm waiting for the steal if this draft class
Go Michigan two picks for Michigan 0 for Michigan State. The NBA is in good hands.
Naming Westbrook, Morant, and Rose as role models is fine, but none of them have won anything in the league and they might never
WEMBYYYYYY WELCOMEEEE KİDDD😊😊😊
Overrated will never win a championship 👎 the number one pick
Not the greatest prospect!
Scoot Henderson has already been illuminated by the illuminati! Throwing up the one eye symbolism! It's truly sad that the future generations have to fall pray to the devil's agenda!
Lbj is the greatest draft of all time
ANTHONYYYYYYYYY , AUSARRRRRR, AMEEEEEEEEENNNNNNNN
There's an ad every time you skip😮
Saan na si kai
sheeeesh, gio wise drafted 6th. Congrats🤣
Im so happy for the Thompson twins. I love them
Did the rox dirty with no camera time for our youngens
Wala paba si kai?
Wish my clippers traded pg for the 3rd pick
Rockets i don't understand why draft another guard over a center
I’m liking this draft class they looking like the next thing poppin🔥
Guys jesus christ is the son of god. He died for the sins of humanity. And he will come back very very soon. Amen and Amen
victor is so lucky spurs had the number 1 pick. Imagine if lbj was drafted to the spurs instead. Not talking about their palyers at the time but they would have won loads of rings with him. Same now with victor if he's good
🔥
Draft day is one of my favourites in sports, getting to watch these young men have their dreams realised, being so happy. Truly happy for them and their families, may they soak up in their new reality and make the best out of this opportunity. Wishing them all the best and an injury free journey 🎉🎉🎉 Let’s go rookies 🏀
The gm or whoever is look like the devil dracula or something look scary
Not enough BLING whole 2023 class too humble
Bc. BDo bb
Where's the diversity?
Damn he tall asf
Shoutout Brandon Miller
You dumbed af if you think Scoot 6’2 athletic shoots 28% from 3 is better tham 6’8 athletic shoots 39% from 3
just wondering how victor will be hurt in the NBA bit didn't get hurt playing basketball before he got drafted tonight... sound like peopl e don't want him to prosper smh
great race diversity lol
Who is he never heard of him what college did he come from the trying to eliminate all the talent from USA trying to let foreigners take over nba to keep blacks from dominating nba
@ 0:26 The Greatest prospect ever that came out of a draft is still LBJ He just didn't live up to the expectation for him he even surpassed them..
Out of Tel Aviv, Moshe Shlepper taken as Center. Out of Baruch Business College, the Small Forward Chayim Chochkallah, goes to the Pistons.  NO...that ain't US.
Lakers pick looked like Jalen hurts💀
They just turnt nick smith jr all the way up
Hornets botch another draft. What a fucking mess 😂
Jhs letgoolakers
2:02 bro really was like "Man fuck this button"
looks like the Afro is trending again.
13:52 I knew he was going to the heat long before the draft he is a heat culture hooper
Anthony Black must've thought it was the WNBA draft..
Bro @Tattoo Sports PH, pagaling muna.✅️ Enough na yung may maganda kang balita para sa mga kababayan natin.🇵🇭
Bro @Tattoo Sports PH, pagaling muna.✅️ Enough na yung may maganda kang balita para sa mga kababayan natin.🇵🇭
Lines like every phone is out make me go to the bathroom
The announcer said from "Lansing to the League" for Jett Howard. University of Michigan is NOT in Lansing, MI. That would be Michigan State where Magic played, not Jowan Howard
too much of style "hair afro" in this draft .... lol
black lives matter
bro they did scoot henderson dirty
The global port select kai sotto
과연 웸반야마는
Victor Bustbanyama
nice to see how happy adam silver is for every young prospect. he really is a worthy successor for david stern. but what the hell is rong with these hairstyles ... most cant even fit a cap

Giannis Antetokounmpo ready to eat Wembanyama 😂

Amateur franchise, Scoot is an athletic and explosive player, he would be what the Hornets needed to take higher flights
The next Tim Duncan
These men are proud to be playing in the NBA
I'm waiting who's going to be drafted in a taco bell commercial this 2023 NBA draft 😎
Scoot learning from Dame is actually really good
One news announcer said history was made to have 2 brothers selected within the top 5 picks. Now had he said 2 Brothas he'd of been dead azz wrong! 🏌️‍♂️
ЦЫрк уродов а не баскетбол
2050 NBA draft from Philippines 🇵🇭 Mr Kai sotto 😁😁
I know it’s all eyes on wemby right now, but trust me scoot is gonna be HIM when the time comes to play
I want everyone to know that Suggs, Black, Dick could’ve been a thing.
It took 8 fucking ads to get into this video I kept having to go out and go back in
Wait til Isiah Collier, Rob Dillingham, Trey Parker and them enter the draft. That class will be special
How many in the 1st round will become felons? What's the over/under?
Go Spurs Go! The future 👽 is here!!
Dallas Mavericks select Kai sotto from Philippines no.31 pick ❤❤
No.1 pick wembanyama
WHO 🤦🏾
brandin podziemski with ring in first season with cp3, mark my words, fr
5:04 ayo what he say? “Once again, the Orlando Magic are an awful sh**ty team?” 😳
I wonder why like half of them not attending the event?
Oh boy. All those fans in Boston, New York, and Philadelphia are gonna have fun with Grady Dick's name with a dirty chant.
Scoot that suit ugly 😂😂
"Greatest propect" .... Jordan took that personal
He said a inappropriate word on live tv 😮😮
Di na magsilbi wembanyama...kai sotto japon na
That electric red suit though
full of hairy guys.
my boy gradey dick was lookin drip as hell 😂😂
Why is Brandon Miller fake talking on the phone like that lol
Agile version of Porzingis.
15:29 bust
15:06  i think this ngga will be baddd bad hall of famer
That can be used or a trade reserve?
Di makaya ang ads😂
The greatest prospect..... I THINK NOT.  (Just like last years #1)   He s tooooo slim.   We ll see if they call him a bust if he doesn't make the playoffs his first year...  LBJ was the biggest coming out of high school.  And lived up to the hype.
Leuge  of Under size😂😂😂😂
phil jackson is the winingest coach
This draft is loaded
This is just the start.
san antonio
8:14 kiss him dady
the g league has killed the draft as far as a tv product
PURO PINCHI SPURS!!!!
Ladies and gentlemen Adam Silver is just a baby before Wembanyama height😂
spurs winning a championship
Kids that’s what the league has become over rated, under developed kids. Still going through puberty.
That Kobe boy at No. 15 looking too much like Jordan Poole 😂
Go spurs go
3:02 bro didn’t mention John wall😒 it’s coo tho… even tho he’s talking about athletic pgs
Imagine saying, DICK FOR THE WIN!💀
History has been made
Wemby looks like a stiff breeze would blow him over lol. Dude needs to add some size.
I counted more than 8 biracials who probably call themselves black and will probably go out with snowbunnies as usual disgusting
Utah jazz did good
Brooklyn got the bag
Nets⬛️⬜️🖤🤍
This is a giant
Derek Lively to Dallas!  Stupid UTAH going to regret passing on him forever!
Scoot Henderson should be going second
We Rockets didnt get a full introduction but thats ok fk U too because we stole the draft..
Why didnt they show the whole rockets pick?
Why people do not talk about Cam Whitmore lol, in future he will be one of the best player in HOUSTON ROCKETS
What were they doing when Marcus sasser got picked 😮
It's crazy to see that even at this time, many rooks are still named after the Real GOAT #MJ23
No .white...good player?
yes 🙏💯
Dick with a Elton John vibes
So much broccoli hair.. the hats need to be resized
The Next Tim Duncan?
K drama nba asshole
I'ma say it now 6-23-23.  Brandon miller- roy Nick Smith jr- will be a key contributor next year Cason wallace- will make some NBA all defensive teams Anthony black- will be a good pg in the league (Shaun Livingston tier)
Mavs are trash, Luka needs to get out of there
Scoot henderso  rookie of the yeat
GO WEMBI, rend nous fiers
ansan si kai sotto?
Top 5 are going to be insane in only a few years
Hornets whyyy whyyyyy
Ggwing laro yn

The Detroit PIGtons!!
Scoot is not going anywhere… with that stupid clothes
Where is Kai sotto
Number 1. Combined tim duncan and dabid robinson. Real talk💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻
The 13th pick has some problems!! How the fuck are you dressed???? Not even black guys where so tasteless....
Hope he stays healthy..hoping he would have a better career than Ralph Sampson..
The Orlando magic second pick...his Dad kissed him on a lip...lol that  boy looked hot.. 😂😂😂😂 like Dang Dad. We're on T.V mannnnn
The number one pick is a Bust just sign Kenneth Lofton jr or Youssoupha Fall. Thank me later 😂😂. Spurs good luck😂😂😂
I remember when this kid was 14 he wrote a comment under a page and said I will be the best player in the world and I commented saying boy no your not 4 years later he literally is the best prospect this kid manifested this 🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿
BIGGEST MISTAKE SPURS EVER MADE!! Wemby is another Bol Bol! And Bol Bol is a nobody in the league.
Let’s go Pistons!!!
Allah is the best and loves you
Where is that mystical tune gone whilst selecting each player need it back for sure
Sayang si kabayan kai Proud pinoy sana Pagnapasali dito Go parin kai..kaya mo yan sipag tyaga lang makakamit mo ang pangarap makapasok Sa NBA 🇵🇭💪
BRANDON MILLER OVER SCOOT?>????????
Only 1 player from college in the top 5 picks, truly an historical draft!
The greatest prospect??😂😂 I got nothing against Viktor but I definitely have something against the commentator. Idek if it stems from being biased but she needs to calm down.
Number1 pick 2023 to Lakers Kai sotto
NBA 🏀 draft picks do the Patriots have to years ago and get it ready 🤟😎
Utah has some of the best management i have seen. They are so good at trading and especially drafting some amazing young talent
Blazers got Anfernee, Sharpe, Scoot, And Dame 😂😂😂😂😂😂 wtf are y’all doing
where’s the number 4 pick announcement 🤣
2019 was a fail i hope this class can make up for it
I hate to say it but script says that Jarace walker will miss out the remainder of the season because of a horrible injury
JHS!!! Let's go!!! 💜💛
Detroit pixton 😅😅😅
Wembanyama, Scoot, Amen&Ausar, Coulibaly, Jett Howard, Bufkin, Keyounte, Whitmore, Dick, Emoni 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾 Congratulations
Crazy Emoni Bates gon be the steal of this draft
Feels like we are seeing the modern day version of Ralph Sampson..
The one thing I could ask from NBA why is there women on our channel but when you watch the WNBA there’s no men on their channel. It’s sad that we have to listen to a woman talk it’s crazy it’s like I don’t even wanna watch the NBA anymore we’ve let women infiltrate our game. It sucks.
We got grandy di-😳😳😳😳😳😳
KAI KOTTO KUYAMAD😂
.iapil xd c KAI KOTTO ninyo😂
Those top 10 picks are going to have an immediate impact crazy talent pool
damn, really wish O’Max Prosper to still be on the board for my celtics
I hope that Wemby will be the healthiest jersey #1 bearer in the history 🙏
I guess the draft wasn’t worth trending on twitter because I don’t see anything about the draft
Hope Scoot can get some help on his outside shooting now that he’s playing with Dame, that would make him almost invincible
my biggest dream
Wemby and Henderson are special picks
Congratulations
Stop it with greatest prospect Luka was MVP in EURO league winning the title and winning EURO with Slovenia just stop it at same age Luka played on a much higher level i Real Madrid he was a starter for god sake. Vic will be good but Luka without any doubt was a bigger prospect.
Can’t wait to see Anthony Black first game
Scoot Better Than Everyone
Stromae as first pick
The NBA of nowadays, looks like a sinking boat. With already double time all-star players just "faking," long time injuries; so not to be a part of the circus. With former playoff MVPs, suddenly "faking," an injury; not to be a part of that same circus. And then, in the draft, some of the best youngster players; just rejected being drafted. With the Thompson family, having to provide two of their sons, to go "save" that same circus, from sinking too fast. And it seemed like, one or two draft night drafted players, just wanted to cry and not leave their dinner tables; when their names got called by the NBA's principal speaker. Being that: I'd say to those two last referred; that a sport is a sport. That can take you to go meet good people, stay in good shape; and also provide for you and your household.
If nba scouts get it wrong so often, there is no way the comments section knows ehat its talking about.
Why are they blowing so much smoke up Victor's ass. Hasn't even proved anything
Why did cam whitmore fall so much?
감동이있다 정말 ㅠ
Thompson brothers looked pissed they were even drafted.
Kai sotto 💯 percentage to NBA but asian was no spot no nba
As a mavs fan i am so pleased with what they were able to do tonight Lively is exactly what they needed
20 years later the legendary 03 draft class, we have potentially another crazy potential draft class.
SPURS is good at developing big man, hope Wemba stays healthy.
Next king😮
Never knew Jett Howard is the son of Juwan Howard. Best wishes for all of the rookies drafted or not. Keep grinding and your names will be known.
Wemba Walker
almost all of the draftees have long hair, hopefully their NBA careers will be long as well
Congratulations 🎊🍾🎉
kai sotto
sayang si kobe paras
Oh oh I see a good ol' fashion western draw down at high noon between Brandon Miller and Ja Moron I mean Morant ... bang!bang!
Keyonte George don't look too happy about going to Utah.
So proud of Ausar and Amen this a big w for overtime
このピックは今後最高のピックになり
I think it's the draft that will revolutionize the NBA
pick 3 guy wearing grillz and glitters please don't get the JaMorant curse. be careful
detroit picktons ))) meme name for the team
Wow so inspirational mane
Allahumma Barik Bilal
でかっ！！
I think hornets made a big mistake passing up Scoot.
americans are not even the best in their own sport anymore hahaha amazing 🇨🇵🇨🇵🇨🇵
God bless them al
nba clip editor seriously has to get fired ☠️
Hornets fucked up
My boy Wembi allez la france
The mavs are crazy for not picking a big unless the are going to try and trade kyrie for a big and some depth. Fucking ridiculous
What in the sombrero is henderson wearing LMAAAAO
the player's suits are ridiculous
Spurs, baby
LOL.
who tf the GSW pick up lmaoo nah......flight not going to like this lol
how about kai sotto?
Wheres Julian Newman mannn!!! 😢😂
Wemby is here
Kai sotto 😢
Any Taco Bell commercial breaks  during the first round?
Kramihan sa first pick poro wla nggwa ngaun hahahhaha
Get Tim Duncan from hiding to guide Wemby on how to be a professional both on and off the court
Kai sotto na mga vloggers hahhaha
Keyonte George is the next Jayden Hardy
And just like that, they're millionaires
Is that Victors momma?
YESS!!! I can’t wait to name my “my players” last name Dick
Maybe aside from Scoot and Wemby, this draft class feels like a bunch of role players, not much 3rd and 2nd options on a championship team
Was that shaggy with scoot ?
imo, best class in years
I want to see who was drafted during a taco bell commercial
DARIQUE WHITEHEAD 🔥 🔥 🔥  🔥  NEWARK BRICK CITY NEW JERSEY WE HERE
Thunders team is so tall 😂
why if he’s name is coulibaly u need to say “culabali”?😂
The Detroit Picktons 🤣
Huge players of future
I dont think victor will shine much there. They made kawhi ride the bench
Brandon Miller faking like he on the phone 📱 is hilarious 😂
Dominant rim protector?? 🤔
First player was so tall 😳
wemby injuries is near ..
Again, I think NBA has rigged a draft.  Don’t get me wrong, I love San Antonio, but just when they’re at their worst, all of a sudden, the biggest market amongst the worst, known for developing young players gets the 1st pick in front of Houston and Detroit? I think that, at least it sounds suspicious Still, congrats to Wembayama. I hope his physique allows him to dominate and that his 3 pt percentage rises. He would be unstoppable then
Insert Kai Sotto please 😘😍🙏
Im glad bronny did not draft.  He is a trash.
Sad the Magic didn't make the Suggs-Dick combination possible
Wtf this draft is absolutely stacked
Wembanyama has a very grateful attitude...
Wheres the nba draft music?
where's buzelis
Very  little diversity...
congrats
Felt bad for Mikey Williams
victor wembayama will dominated nba like kareem abdul jabbar
500
Webby is gonna be a GOAT 🐐, Jordan Second GOAT
Everyone expects Victor to be the best, but this could play out how everyone thought Olajuwon was going to be the best but instead it was Jordan but it could be Brandon Miller or someone unexpected
#3 pick is gonna 🔥
Still no hype like Mr Lebron James im have i hope he doesn't injuries to set him back PLEASE!
Isn't Koulibaly a soccer player
kindergarden
Victor wembeyama nice pick
#ceritabasket
Bruh people really think Wenbenyama better than KP
Media nowadays are crazy 😵‍💫 #1 pick the ever 😅😂😂😂 imaging the French guy facing Shaq 😬😵😂🤣👍🏽
Sahtek Bilal wallah je te connaissais pas mais quelle fierté d’entendre Adam Silver prononcer ton nom! De Courbevoie à la NBA, tu peux être fier!
It's Finna Be Scary Nights in Houston, MPJ, JG,Sengun,Amen,Cam Whitmore Scary nights for real
That first pick selection might have been very difficult for the spurs 😊
Bust like ODEN... injury all career

I thought Cam Whitemore died, he was projected to be top 5, falling to 20th is a crime
Portland W
Well.. The suite lives up to MJ's escapades 🤣🤣🤣Now lets see if his skills do..
scoot is better than miller, but is okay
Getting Scoot on 3 feels illegal
衣装が派手過ぎる NBAドラフトであって、グラミー賞の受賞式ではない
Credits to Coach Pop, Granpa really know how to tank.
These dudes dressed like shit but have high hopes for the class a whole
Warriors need to stop drafting guards WE NEED A BIG MAN!!!!!
The San Antonio Tanks select... A gift from Adam Silver despite doing what he warned the entire league not to do before the season. 😭😭😭
Cam Whitmore no 20??
what are those chains they wear? :D Hendersons outfit is just ridiculous- they could have learned at least one thing from this season that being humble and concentrated on the game gives results
Bro I was like how the fuck did A. Thompson get drafted twice💀(I watched it in class without sound)
Victor has alot to prove. Best of luck to this young man!
Scoot should have gone second. Miller shouldn’t even playing basketball anymore. He is a murderer!
Came to check if the suits still look goofy and I was not disappointed
blazers you never learn he needed a real team not yall
like a legend
Didn't Brandon Miller Bring his teamate a gun that was used to murder two women?
She said the greatest prospect to ever walk across this stage. 🤣🤣🤦🏾‍♂️ Nah

[  1 Cor. 1:18  ]  But we preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews a stumblingblock, and unto the Greeks foolishness;  [  1 Cor. 1:19-21-23-31  ]  ( For many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell you even weeping, that they are the enemies of the cross of Christ: [  Philippians 3:18  ]  Whose end is destruction, whose God is their belly, and whose glory is in their shame, who mind earthly things. )  [  Philippians 3:19-21  ]  For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;  [  1 Cor. 15:1-3; Luke 23:1-56  ]  And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures: [  1 Cor. 15:1-4; Luke 24:1-53  ]  GOD'S INTERVENTION HUMANITIES ONLY HOPE OF SALVATION!   But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. [  Romans 5:8  ]   For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. [  John 3:3-15, 16, 36  ]   All that the Father giveth me shall come to me; and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out.  [  John 6:37-39  ]  Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation [ sacrifice ] for our sins.  [  1 John 4:10  ]   For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.  [  Romans 6:23; 1 Thess. 5:10  ]  Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness: by whose stripes ye were healed.  [  1 Peter 2:24; Isaiah 53:1-12  ]   In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace;  [  Eph. 1:7; Eph. 2:8-9  ]  Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him.  [  Romans 5:9; 1 Thess. 5:9  ]   He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.  [  John 3:3-18  ]    And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.  [  John 3:3-18-19  ]  For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved.  [  John 3:3-18-19-20  ]  He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.  [  John 3:3-18-19-20, 35, 36  ]  Ur Life! Ur Fate!  Ur Move! Ur Call!  Ur Choice! Ur Resolve!  Ur Due!  Consequences!  Ur Destiny! & Ur Eternity!  The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.  [  2 Peter 3:3-9-13  ]  If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. [  1 John 1:9; Isaiah 55:6-7  ]  That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.  [  Romans 10:9; Acts 10:34-43  ]  For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.  [  Romans 10:10  ]   For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed.  [  Romans 10:11  ]   And to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead, even Jesus, which delivered [ rescued ] us from the wrath to come. [  1 Thess. 1:10 KJV Bible  ]           °  ! ¡ °                     ° ! ¡ °
Why they skipped some of these picks? Like the 2nd pick (we didn't get to see him walked the stage!!!) and the 4th pick (His name wasn't even CALLED!!!!)  Please redo this video b/c wtf!
Spurs could easily becomes relevant again. Good trades from now on. Good coaching. Good culture. Good development of this young man. Let’s see.
I would like to buy the #13 pick Jersey's when he play.   My man had the best Name. 😂😂😂😂
Haven't played a day, haven't earned a dollar, and yet half of them got some heavy ass jewelry. Them chains bigger than fucking rappers. This next generation of ballers are nothing but a bunch of Ja Morants.
Congrats Jaime Jaquez Jr. ! Representing raza Chicanos 🎉🎉👍🏾
And Scoot got picked and this draft is over.
If this scrawny dude thinks he can play 82 games without bulking up he and all of you are delusional. I'm calling Greg Oden on this choice
A whole my player clone just got drafted 😂 #1 over all wtf
'memba Chet? LeBron sneezed next to the kid and suddenly he was out of career.
Indiana? what a pick😂😂
oklahoma young team they have good player  next season thunder will be  interesting to watch

Chet Homlgren II
Brady Dick?! Announcers are gonna have issues with saying his name!  "He passes to Dick, Dick to the hole...HE SCORES"! 🤣🤣
Detroit Picktons
I really wish they wouldn't do that crap where you see the commissioner call out which player goes to which team and then while you're watching online you see that the team's want to swap players behind the scene. Like how they did with OKC and Dallas.
The NBA should prepare bigger caps haha😂😂
He might gon be the next tim ducan but probably better
I don’t know why we got jamie but okay
Adam Silver pronounce Pistons like he was Mike Tyson. 3:54
Congratulations to all of the young men and their families and loved ones and don't let anyone talk you into to spending all of your money it's alright to get a couple of things that you always wanted but make Dam sure that you save your money and look out for the Leaches and buy your mom and dad a home.
Griddy dick haha

Greatest prospect? That would be Wilt
wrong draft for spurs
mr.DICK 13th pick
This is an interesting draft, happy an Alabama guy got drafted second overall, we don't just play basketball, we hoop too.
NBA DRAFT IS LIKE GRADUATION FOR BEING AMATURE BASKETBALL PLAYERS TO BEING PRO BASKETBALL PLAYERS .
Why the hell is Mike Epps hugging Scoot Henderson
Greatest ever prospect?????  Who is this stupid lady.
Spurs only got one first round pick??? All that tanking and for what? Kidding, spurs didnt tank we sucked.
Wembanyama looks like Slender Man😂
Going to enjoy this first-round pick because you never know when we'll get another one Go Spurs Go!

For the past 5 years, European countries ruled NBA now. from NBA MVP's to 2023 Nba 1st pick. just saying 😚
Went from 0 Kobe's in the league to 2 in one night. R.I.P legend. They will never live up to the name but thats not their fault.
Where's the racial diversity lol
Here before Victor becomes great
as a mavs fan, i will never doubt our gm ever again
Wemby is freaking tall
when i herd Kobe.... i was like oh damn.. then back to reality
I hope Wembanyama dissapoints like Zion
I really wish the number 1 pick live up to the hype...
Where's Kai Sotto? I thought he will be drafted coz he's the BEST PLAYER in the whole universe!!! He can shock everybody and play well against Lebron and Steph and Jokic. 😂😂
That boy in stilts 😅
Wellcom to hell!!!!
Wembanyama
Brandon Miller gonna be a beast
Good luck for Victor.. get that body some muscles.

Lebron is the GREATEST PROSPECT! I hope they give him all the shit .Scoottt Lets GOOO !
Damn 2 Michigan players go in the first round
Is Wemby a PF or C?
Great Dallas drafted another guard 😅😅😅
Indiana Pacers wasted the 7th pick...
I imagine if Grady Dick shoots three Announcer be like: Dick For Threee!!

With the 45th pick in the nba draft the memphis grizzlies select Glock 9  the university of JA Morants house !
Okc? Lol
Let's go kai hope for kai sotto
Jordan drafting Brandon miller reminds me of him drafting Michael kidd gilgritch
Victor on 2K 24 gonna be crazy!!
Picktons
When you need someone to consistently get to the hole and give you great penetration, you draft Grady Dick.
Spurs and blazers good luck
Congratulations to all the young men that have been picked to in the NBA DRAFT. I WANT TO JUST SAY THEY HAVE BEEN BLESSED WITH A TALENT, REMEMBER IT'S HARD WORK. DON'T TAKE ANY THING FOR GRANTED. LOOK AT THE MISTAKES MADE BY OTHER MEMBERS OF THE NBA AND ALWAYS KEEP GROUNDED. THEY HAVE ALL BEEN GIVEN A BLESSING. CONGRATULATIONS AND GO KNICKS IN THE UPCOMING SEASON. BUCKS TOO 😉😮😊
Victor Wembanyama next big NBA star 👏👏👏👏🌟
这是故事的开始
Illuminati confirmed

I hope wemby is over hype.. Lets see in next season
Victor under Tim Duncan's guidance is gonna a problem
So many young lives are gonna change now. I really hope that every single of them 30 rn will get chance to show themselves and to improve thru season.
Yao ming 2.0
ah shit .. adult actresses salivating with the prospects.
If not injury prone. Hes a beast
Hes chet holmgren with 3 more inches
GRADDY Dick 😂👏
My cousin Jamie Jaques got drafted to the Mami heat 18th pick so proud!!😢🎉
Oh my, the draft is so diverse that no Whites and no other groups  than  all Blacks got picked
This draft is stupidly stacked
Why this malika bitch so fake and got such a deep voice …
Let’s go we got scoot!!! Blazers forever!!!!
Perhaps the greatest prospect bc hes 7’4? Lol they said same about ben simmons a bigger taller lebron lol please …..shaq lebron duncan all better prospects
Scoot henderson the next derrick rose he will be an mvp nba champion and nba all time greats im exited to watch whats next for him and wemby goodluck to all the new nba players
This video did Amen dirty man
Wow nba you do a horrible job in editing and uploading. I want to hear these analyst talk about them a little more after their names were called.
Atlanta hawks drafting Kobe Burkin extends to 11 str8 seasons someone named Kobe / Coby has been drafted in the 1st round
Jesus loves u.
alot of these guys have huge bush hair on their heads… they can’t even put the hat on their heads, maybe it’s time for a haircut🤷🏻‍♂️
Lebron is the greatest prospect ever, stop disrespecting the king comparing him to this tall stick
scoot got robbed of 2nd
Goat draft
Class looks classy. No flash just legit
Congratulations 🎉 Spurs!
Wemby will be ROTY
Greatest prospect lmaoooooo the desperate attempts to build ratings are ridiculous. This dude is overrated and you will see. Brandon Miller is the best player in the draft.
As a basketball fan, I’m pretty sure most of us would love to be in the shoes of these guys. Congratulations to them though
Never Forget that Nikola Jokic was Drafted ROUND 2 #41 in 2014 and he is Currently Top 10 Center NBA ALL Time and Never Forget #1 Over All Pick of 2016 is Ben Simmons Useless and a Bust
Kai Sotto is the real deal
the Thompson brothers is winner of this daft...
Another busted 1st pick in the making.😂😂😂
The Detroit pigtons is crazy.
Victor W! Congrats Spurs…next great big for y’all! 🤙🏾
Bulshit  setup  fake ass NBA
Worst nba draft eva
Kobe Bufkin! Looks like someone who can replace Jordan Poole as "NBA player with most punchable face"
dude is a 7 foot 4 inch skeleton😂…. he isn’t gunna live up to the hype, unless he takes a few cycles of gear.
bro kobe got picked by the wrong LA 💀
A lot of these kids nowadays dress so flashy, it’s funny. 😂
History
Sacramento meant to be with that pick in violet suit 💪
It would be damn funny if Spurs did not select Wemby, just for trolls
GO SPURS GO!!!
LeTampering 😂😂😂😂😂😅😅😅😅
No Knicks😢🗽🌃😉😴
Grady Dick….lol what a name.😂😂😂😂😂
Can someone explain why the jazz had three first round picks?
Does anyone else find it funny that when these players are drafted onto a basketball team the first thing they do is put on a baseball cap?   Basketball needs its own headgear for crissakes.
They fuckin say the same thing about every years number 1 pick always the same thing generational this n that he will be a busy guarantee you.
Fino’s mom. 👌🏼 Lakers front office got taste.
GO! Kai Soto from the Philippines
Gradey can’t wait to see him ball out for Toronto 🔥🔥🔥
Historic moment? Let him prove it to us first before saying those words. Walk the Talk
Masonic Handshake

Why no 4 pick was skipped in the video
Imagine Bronny James getting drafted next year with Lebron James in attendance, for me that's crazy wild ❗🤯
I was shocked with this pick I can't lie 😎🍻🍺
Lesss Go Miller🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉  Also, Magic missed out on having Jalen Suggs, Anthony Black, and Gradey Dick on the same team.
We need more SERBIANS , I would recommend;)🎉🎉🎉🎉
Scoot shoulda been number 2 by drip alone
Lakers should have drafted Jaime Jaquez Jr. "TripleJ" , just because.   GWish him luck in Miami though.
Anthony Black, you couldn’t tame that shit hair for one day so you can proudly wear the hat???  Damn.
Let’s Go Rockets!!! Amen 🙏 for that late steal, and as a HUGE Rockets fan I am so happy for Wemby
Marcus Sasser will be amazing for the grizzlies, I will miss him very much in Houston and wish him the best of luck in his career
I’m a MIZZOU fan, lesss gooo Kobe!!!! Hopefully dmoi will get drafted soon!!!!!!!!

Wenbynama will be wack I bet.
Highly prospects No.1 pick Wenbamyama since lebron 2003 draft .
Portland Won this Draft Watch the Player Scoot become
#27 pick will be my star .. give me 3 years
I hope Brandon Miller has a chip on his shoulder, as a Hornets fan he's a great pick, despite Scoot being the better prospect currently we'll have to see how their careers play out.
