😂😂😂dying boy's condition.
no condition you better out in russian territory..crazy..
I didn't even bother to read "Putin's terms and conditions", if its one thing Putin's proved he is incapable of doing, it is honoring a treaty, any treaty the Russkies make won't be worth the paper its printed on and they'll need some kind of collateral to guaranty it.  Not typed words on a page.
And what was the conditions
Basically if Ukraine give in and loose the war then.  "Invasion" you mean Annexation?
Oberall Putin has lost the war. He is a crazy species in the animal kingdom.
You know what , forget Putins crap ,,he wants war ,well hes gonna get it 👹
Now i m confused.   Who started the war???
I expected to know about the conditions Wion. You people are disappointing audience day by day
Vladamir Putin is the most prominent leader of our time.
Ukraine deserves this!
Perhaps because Putin is running out of tanks? I mean really? He’s deploying T-55s?
Im am sure that Ukraine  would also stop fighting if Russia would stop fighting and all of Ukraine's demands are met
And now?
Which are the conditions????
It's a big failure for America and NATO than Ukraine  , it's proven barking dogs are not the strongest
nuts your russian ass is kick
Same story over and over, Putin wants it his way
How come the invader will set a conditions before he will stop a war..
Russians are setting conditions you know why? Hahaha
Russia cannot be trusted in any way. The nuclear weapons of Ukraine were surrendered to Russia in the past years for the condition that Russia will NOT invade Ukraine. But, look what the Russians are doing now!!!
No body is begging puttin to stop her aggressive invasion to Ukraine'
Zelenski sir withdrew from NATO immediately, you can understand this days politics regarding Taiwan from Europe.
NATO demands that Putin take his dirt nap this year or the Russian Federation will be vaporized
No,bugger off,leave,asshole,you and your hoard of rapist serial killers
That's a great idea! I say let moscow take over
Turkey, Russia, China, Iran. The axis of evil.
Russia Must Take odessa
Its probably stop expanding NATO.
*HEY GENIUSES...WHAT ARE THE RUSSIAN CONDITIONS????? I THOUGHT THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A NEWS NETWORK....SMH*
YES, PUTIN HAS GLORIOUS PLAN FOR THE WORLD PEACE.... WORLD GANGSTERS MUST STOP SUPPLYING WAR WEAPONS TO UKRAINE... IDIOT PRESIDENT ZELENSKY STOP THE WAR , A DIPLOMATIC SOLUTION IS POSIBLE, IN CONDITION STOP LISTENING TO THOSE GANGSTERS USA, UK, EU, AND NATO, THEY ARE USING UKRAINE SELLING WEAPONS FOR WAR..TO DEFEAT RUSSIA AND PRESIDENT PUTIN..
Trash. Where are the demands,???
Thank you Jesus christ!!
Condition is unconditional withdraw. I would before it escalate into a multi nation war.
Moscow is not serious for peace talks... it's just a pretext to continue a war they will never win....
keep destroying moscow ss much as possible. do not recognize set condition of putin. conditions only favor putin nothing  for ukraine.
Putin is on the right track, asking for dialogue.
Putin is a demon god don't believe in all what he said!!!!!!!!!!
ឯងទាញប្រទេសសេរីឱ្យលូកដៃចូលក្នុងសង្រ្គាមកុំសង្ឃឹមថាឯងដើរចេញពីសង្រ្គាមដោយស្រួល។
Before this war Russia had it pretty good.
Putin has me rooting for blood cancer
The documentation of the documents were very well documentated.
Erdogan is the last person in the earth to be trusted. Greatest back stabber
Sponsors of Ukraine destruction are exhausted and seem to have run out of ideas  now. Russia can only achieve it military goals. So perhaps Russia should ignore calls for cease-fire for now.
If you stop war one day early it will save life of thousands.. Nothing is more valuable than life.. Please stop this ..stop your ego's.. I love people of Russia and people of Ukraine...  You peoples are not going to get any benefits from war.. may God help to end this ...hare krishnaa 🙏🙏
America is a death camp for white men and the owners of the camp are Jewish. They brag about it on television. Even the U.S president said whites will be the minority as time goes on. Vice President Kamala Harris was even bold enough to say they should only help people of color after a hurricane in Florida.
What are the conditions?
There's no reason to make demand, you invaded Ukraine, there is a consequence in all demonic act wait for that in your country to happen.
My prediction a full scale war will take place and a new world order will be implemented by which ever country who will win the war. Peace then will take place 🙏 😌
The problems is that madlensky demanding things out of logical terms amid he is in the losing side.
His the one doing in the beginning the war, Vladimir Putin  stop the in GOD FAITH NO CONDITION!  🙏👍 Many People in Ukraine suffering..✌️ok!! Surrender NOW! Vladimir Putin...
A Very Funny Parrot he is
edogarn must firs leave NATO

You better end your wrong doing because time is coming to anend😊if not you become to ashes in the near future sence the begaining I told you if withdraw your soldier your become a hero promise it must be done before the end of february .
Take the whole Ukraine 🎉
And I thought US media was clownshow...
Btw Erdogan op.. ♡
wion is becoming funny
isn't this just funny
This man is delusional.  He is losing the war, but he still demands conditions.
Putin it's easy do as I say and I'll leave ...
I wonder how all those " earth like " planets are doing out there in the universe that have supposedly been discovered in recent years... 🛸.......🌏 🌏 🌏 🌎
The demand is that NATO won’t install its troops in Ukraine or Crimeea. Still need babysitting after all this time?
So the future of Ukraine is going ti be decided by everyone except Ukraine
Ukraine is a Proxy. This is just another failed attempt by the World's elite to oust Putin and rob Russia of its wealth. Anywhere in the world you find the left in control of policy making in disguise of being for the poor against the banks against big business  is nothing but a rouse. Getting back to Putin. He's been on their crosshairs. They Demonize him and have been using him as a threat  for this and for that. The left (Deep State) is in control of the US Military Industrial Complex. (Corporate Wealth, Wealthy Donors,World Bank). You want this crap to end?  Run your left wing machines out of your countries, stop being so ignorant and needy. You'll always know, if you're paying attention, when the left wants to control something it will create a boogeyman. And you people will fall for it everytime. If ignorance continues to dominate in voter turnout,  they'll vote you into slayery.( what the left calls Protection)

A condition of my demand,Putin is removed from the gene pool and all his relatives.This filth needs to be  sterilized.
Wion does a lot of click bait I'm about to unsubscribe
❤️🇷🇺🇹🇷❤️
The demands are to keep the annexed territories and crimea obviously
Peace is simple and entirely within vladimir putin's personal power                                                 (well, at least within the oligarchs power that allow him to play tzar): Leave Ukrainian territory completely, including Crimea.
PUTIN NEEDS TO STATE HIS DEMANDS. As for the West watch your back you might get stabbed in it, by America.
I thought the European Union wanted to welcome more and more refugees
No conditions just give up
Dreadful. Two minutes of saying the same thing over and over. What are the demands!? They never said.
How is this "breaking news" lol
Palki is on "Firstpost"
When are they kicking Turkey out of NATO?
Erdoğan iis the only honest leader in the world, but US us are going to dictate and implant through country with sectarian. Secularism linked for satanism, guyism, bidenism .
What a hypocrite in the meantime he's killing hundreds of Kurds in Syria and Northern Iraq the coup several years ago was erdogan himself because he wanted to arrest all the people who are against him which he did thousands and thousands of arrests fired all the teachers fired all the lawyers abolished civil rights laws on and on and on what a hypocrite
I knew these talks were pointless. This war was only ever going to be decided on the battlefield.
So let me clear this shi.t out , Putin invading Ukraine killing Ukrainians and to stop this killing we have to agree with the invader's condition ???  This world 🌍 is finished
is he surrendering then
Conditions are:  1) Surrender  2) Surrender more
Love it Putin won't talk to Biden lol lol coz Biden is a nobody from a no one country usa
Many of people have lost their life and now he deside to choose peace and milions of people have died in war  stupid
He is eating his hat now..
Why invade then want to halt if you going to invade then invade don’t hold back. Ukraine ain’t holding back
Aber señor Bladimir Putin estoy pidiendo efetivo para comer y segir estos onbres no lo entienden
The open minfed side shoud bite it
Lol 😆 ya right
News with no content… ABSOLUTE RUBBISH,just wasted my previous time to listen to this trash 😡
Free Kurdistan!
Putins condition is he wants Ukraine to stop fighting, bahahahaha, they will stop fighting as soon as putins murderers backs off to their own country. Their only fighting for their country because putin invaded it. Hello putin is there anybody home hello wake up putin.
A senseless and needless war (deep breathe ) I pray for peace may the souls of the departed rest in peace......Amen
We are sick of Putin killing all those people
President Zelensky please surrender to avoid more blood shed. Russia will be responsible to build Ukraine back.
If Putin puts conditions thats good because it allows a negotiated end of the war. Of course those conditions WION does not detail, are for the opening of negotiations, not the end. Good news.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂     🇺🇦💪💪
In essence he is telling Ukraine to surrender
Such an idiotic clip. Unsubscribed.
Dis-man-till the v-ir-us, Put-in smarty-pants. No braggin', Gee. Respect 4 ever.🌷
Sounds like a special political retreat is starting, in support of their special military freeze the troops who have insufficient weapons strategy
send toilet paper to the kremlin.  lots of it
💥🛸💥Yep💬🪐💥O schit! its DANO  🌠🙌🌚🌬💥However in the hell you losing your war, that isn't a war, but instead, slipped and flat-foot audacity to demands for the better sides to takes prides in your barbaric infidels sickening demands ?! .                   💥🙌🌞💥FOH  .                  🌠  .                      🗨Just about to say that  🏔👐😫👣🏞🍿🥱💥☝️😒💥🤣💥😊💥Yep

What are the Russians demand ? What is putin's demand ? Type them out please the west need to see them now. No country to invade another independent country ok . Putin you have to withdraw   from ukrain now.
Praying for peace between the two nations 🙏
Why does YT recommend an old video...
Putin the autocratic ruler of Russia decided to invade Ukraine a peaceful country,  now after being defeated militarily he's looking for a softer way of ending the war. For the countless war crimes and reparations he'll always be judged harshly in history books.
What are Moscow demands? 🤔 Hum I don't think Ukraine should trust those old Russian. Mr  Vladimir  Putin is slick as oil grease.
Sweet!❤❤
The Nazi got to go!😭😭😭😭😭
I love President Putin he is a Real Man!❤❤❤❤
That showed just how demented Putin is, just like the punch happy street fighter who said  "If you give up I'll stop beating your fist with my face. and getting blood all over your hands.
What was the answer of the Besieged Battling Bastards at Bastogne?(WW2-Battle of the Bulge) NUTS!!😡 SLAVA UKRAINE 🇺🇦
NATO SHOULD SET IT’t own conditions: First- Putin and all his generals have to surrender to the World court to face charges on war crimes. Second- Russia has to turn over all its nuclear arsenal, and that means everything. They’ve made it painfully clear that they can not be trusted with anything more dangerous than a sling shot. Russia is to remain open for inspection until 2030. Third- Russia is to provide restitution, not only to Ukraine, but to every other country it’s actions have harmed. I assume you are thinking that it’s asking too much, but as the saying goes “CAN’T DO THE TIME, DON’T DO THE CRIME”
😡😠🤬😈👿🤡 Beauty must think that the Ukraine and the world are stupid hes not asking for negotiations hes asking for surrensir  He cannot take any more loss or humiliation  The Ukraine should tell Russia to just leave the Ukraine and the war will stop  Stick to their own Russian borderlines  Sign a contract that he will not invite the Ukraine  Use the Turkish people and Americans as a boy stand out with the British  And the world will respect if the war stops There are lots of signs here that Putin is failing to impress the Russian people and the country  If he refuses to leave the Ukraine then the war will not stop
Zelensky did not learn a lesson from France in WW2.   Talk and not to fight.  Resulted to France still a beauty until now.
Turkey can't stop the war lol you need to be talking to America Putin lol funny Glory to Ukraine 🇺🇦🇺🇲
Bs turkeys a Russian puppet…Putin demands Ukraine stop did anyone tell Putin he’s losing …ceasefire when Putin’s soldiers leave Ukraine and Crimea and pays war reparations for rebuilding the civilian infrastructure he purposefully targeted and then stands trial for war crimes of rape and torture then Ukraine will talk ceasefire…I say Ukraine fights till this is so and takes Moscow as retribution!!!
BS.  Puttins. All. F-UP.   In his meantaly sick mind. Of being a killer. Of. Inasense. Of are human race of world- WIDE
Did Russian President Vladimir Putin,  Ancestors Sell ALASKA To USA Many Years Ago ? USA Out Smart Russia In That Deal! 🙂
yea just piss off ,job done
This didn't age well for pupin
get them new long range missels onto the boarders of ukraine ...aimed right at moscow then let him set his conditions ....lol
special operation will end under my conditions ....lol  well done putin
What are the demands ?? crazy putting this on when you don't know the demands
Lots of Russian Trolls from India are in this channel
Terrorist Putin can't be trusted a big liar and traitor God blessed UKRAINE'S nation suffering from terrorist put in attacks
The condition song terrorist Putin is belittling Ukraine's capacity
Nonsense reporting what is the condition and demand?
The western media points to the Zelensky family as a “family of heroes”, which makes no sense. Elena and her children are protected, safe, moving between different countries and away from the frontline. The Ukrainian president himself, according to various reports, is not even in Kiev. There are investigations that point out that he is staying somewhere in Poland or close to the border, in safe areas, although he often goes to Kiev for official events. Netizens have also recently emphasized the suspicious fact that Zelensky often records live videos in brightly lit rooms, even during periods of power outage in Ukraine.  So, to sum it up, the Zelensky family is safe, without any suffering, but they want the people to bear all the consequences of a prolonged war just to serve the interests of the West. The Ukrainian military should become aware of this and stop serving as a proxy in a conflict that does not benefit the Ukrainian people.
What are those conditions?  Pathetic news editing.  WION is becoming Whatever Instead Of News.
So I'm guessing you don't know what the demands are.
So, that means that he wants to keep losing lives and war machinery, and later He'll surrender like looser that he is !!!
Zelensky wont agree to end because it will end his fame of camera
Well, Ukraine will only stop fightning when Russia leaves. So, Putin either leaves Ukraine, or the fightning will just continue.
Never trust Russians . Russia is a terrorist state.  Slava Ukraine 🇺🇦🌻🇺🇦🌻🌻🌻🌻 🇺🇦🇺🇦🌻
Nothing but lie's
Remember Putin had started the war😂😂😂
Never trust Putin..Damage already done😂😂😂
What are those 10demands? Jyou just beating the  bush with two statements
2 minutes of repeating "will halt the war if conditions are met" and nothing else said. *WHAT* conditions?!
Ukraine should never stop fighting unless there are no longer Russian troops on their soil take Russian troops off Ukraine's soil then stop fighting
He is getting tired 😴
disturbing psychology of putin..really disturbing..The World know that Ukraine will not agree with putins disturbing psychology.. how will Putin pay the damages caused by his lies and killings???🙄🙄🙄.. war freak crazy mind of pootin🙄🙄🙄.. Change Putin already..🙄.. The World doesnt need him🙄
Sounds like Russian desperation.  Russia lost 15,000 soldiers in ten year Afghan war compared to 80,000 in nine months in Ukraine.  Soon, Russia will have to admit defeat after running out of soldiers.
Can't deal with a sociopaths
ahahaha this putin is crazy demanding while lossing
Keep dreaming Pootin.
There can be no peace with a mass murderer and some one who tries to fool the world not just Russian people ! He must be named for trial on human right violations
This video is full of lies, NWONEWS
No.
BOTH THE BASTARDS
Ukraine stop fighting or first stop cease fire, required by Putin, isn't proper desire, the invader should stop or cease fire first
What are Moscow’s demands?
Moscow end any demands and leave Crimea simple
Arroganone is invading Syria and brokering peace in Ukraine.. 😂
Demonic leader
I noticed how Erdogan always everywhere for peace, but never talks how he is invading Syrian and Kurdish territory and murdering people.
Y
Winning for Putin and holy people
E
D
If Putin has concerns re: the wayward course of this war as it seems to be morphing into some playground for novel war weapons from the West i.e. USA amidst Ukrainian ruins, he is just and correct in wrapping up the conflict because it will be a warm and sunny day in June before Zelensky will relinquish his cherished moral ground to negotiate. Well done, Putin!
11/23/22 Untill the peoploe experiencrese a niver govt. will they protest and demand a changel.
Thank  God  hoping that’s Russia ends the conflict , peace  must prevail okey ba toooo , no more war ?????.
Non aggression pact part XVII....
Ukraine should wake and compromise with Russia
What are the conditions - 😂😂😂
Very older news 8 year to late
So,  the clown is asking for conditions to stop the war he started?  POOR CLOWN.
Here is another lier like friend China. Now he make condition he's losing the war what Putin the Great think the world stupid they know your losing the war and you military tag RIP in Ukraine and running away.? And you make condition? Biden might believe your winning and ask Ukraine to give up
The U N must set condition not Putin
Yeah right! Now Russians are losing the

Redacted...  y.t.
Ukraine Ukraine leave the Hunter..
Ukraine Ukraine ...leave Joe B ..
Russia is in no way able to even ask for conditions they started this war Ukraine is going to finish it
Cannot trust Putin for any negociations with nobody on this planet,
Putin is behaving in a manner reminiscent of the biblical Pharaoh of Egypt. It is stated in the Bible that God "hardened Pharaoh's heart so that he  continued to refuse from releasing the Children of Israel, resulting in God destroying him (Pharaoh) and proving His (God's) might.
pewkin can dream on , he will lose this war and russia will collapse!! good riddance. pewkin is a liar and cheat
Putin exhausted almost all his missile arsenal thus he wanted peace to avoid Ukrainian vengeance's
Baseless
What are the conditions/ demands now?? You forgot to mention...🤔
Nobody cares Putin, just get out of the world's way so we can move forward. Someone should put you in a retirement home with a computer and like Command and Conquer video games so you can sit there and pretend you still have an army without getting anyone hurt over your dumb old man mid life crisis.
Waste of everyone's time.
thiers no peace till putin is indited and serves his prison sentance for his war crimes , until then the war does not end in ukraine
i got one condition on behalf of zelensky nato and the majority populous surrender,  back off get out of ukraine , then do your bird
what condition..no condition.. just go back to your barracks..so many commander killed in action due to flying..drones..from other countries
I'm sorry but that news clip just said nothing.
If the US dumps Ukraine, EU and NATO should take over. NATO's members are the ones to be affected by Putin's insane expansionism
After murdering thousands  of innocent civilians, men women and children?
The best condition is to withdraw all Putin's forces in Ukrainian soil
Yeah putins keep dreaming
I am commenting from India. This is my message to the Russian president Putin.  Ukraine will not stop fighting a war of freedom......a war of resistance against Russian aggression. It will not tolerate infringement on its sovereignty. Russia must stand down and step off Ukrainian soil. My appeal to Vladimir Putin.........Get off Ukrainian country while you still can. You must pay for war damages and help restore all that you criminally destroyed. Ukraine with western support will fight to finish and inflict mighty devastation on Russia.
Hmmmm.... what Russia wants and what they are going to get are two different things.  There will be no cease fire. The war will continue till the russians ablity to wage war is totally demolished.  Refugie - crisis? Hogwash! Poland will need some monetary support from allied countries, but that is all, and it is coming.  Just heard that Great Britain has locked in 20 billion USD in stolen russian funds.
What a plonker, Ukraine is winning pushing them back lol
What crazy news
What u crazy
I am just trying to write English properly. All this happened because of the proposal to join the NATO.  Ukraine will win in the true sense only when Ukraine joins NATO, Ukraine can't be slave of any country They must join NATO.
Palki sharmas puuuthin has come again..
No conditions were talked about but let’s be real … we will be right back here in a few years time. Russia has proven that its doesn’t honor its promises.
putin wont get the chance to have a say ukraine is the boss,
A good condition is to move out from all Ukrainian soil and pay damages
Wow hahahahhahahha
But it's china's turn now to invade taiwan. U will see.
Mejor mandar  una mision militar especial de la otan a limpiar Ukrania de soldados Rusos y despues conversamos
Why they keep going to this A hole! For talks he doesn't want to talk he wants war so let him have it nobody here isn't afraid of him he better pray the war don't expand cuz the US won't be the only country he has to worry about firing on them.
Great terms: 1. All Russian forces withdraw from all Ukrainian territories past and present. 2.  Russia pays $750bn in repatriation.
There will be be headings of american traitors. C. Thomas Comey Barret Kavanaugh Gorsuch. Trump his family  Republican politicians. Voters enemies.Targets.. These are traitors Who vote for your deaths. USA s death.democracy Human rights civlvrights Voting elections corruption Facist. Treasons lies.  You. Choose  life or. death. If you are a republican.your a traitor no Its  buts you are an enemy.
Respect to Putin.
Putin will simply withdraw all forces from all Ukrainian soil then war will end ultimately
Russia started now must bear consequences for innocent civilians and scattered .
There's only one problem when it comes to peace talks with Putan, he will only use it to gain territory. Peace talks with Putan have failed in the past because he lies to gain territory. So now Volodymyr Zelensky won't try to negotiate with Putan.
World get real…This is another example of unnecessary wars that kill people and destroys the biggest cities on earth..And if the knuckleheads do not stop stupid wars, our creator will once and for all and allow.The smallest insects,rats and ants to inherit Gods planet ,after erasing mankind off the face of gods planet …And the smart folks have been allowed by that creator to stockpile enough nukes, to get the job done on that day of fire and fury,,..Why do you think our world got thousands ready for one word…******…..😨😱😰
Ok we should listen
Ukraine should accept this condition
Wtf are the demands ???
America won't allow it unfortunately they want more war
What are the conditions? What are the demands? 😂 none of this was mentioned
Hope now, Leaders involved in this conflict sit together for bringing peace for Ukraine and Russia as well. 🌟
WION loosing track. What a clickbait tittle
only russia can demand,how about the ukraine demand, will it be disregarded.?
Peace  at almost any price better than nuke fryed world but we have bidens green brain in the pot
It's necessary to have conditions
dont believe anything he says
This man  is out of mind.
Ukraine will stop fighting if putin troop get out of ukraine territory including crimea.
......and you won't say what those demands of Moscow are!!!!
I hope the answers tough shit to putin
no nuclear we need a good  nuclear war to put things in back in balance
What are Moscow's demands?
The Usa and uk wont except!
Thanks for nothing ))
Putin can  give instructions
😆😆😆😆
I just pray that God enters his heart and Zelensky comes to his senses and makes Peace with Russia🙏🙏
Oh zelensky will sacrifice all his people....he don't care....as long as USA tells him to keep fighting.
Hell with you Putin
And Ukraine has destroyed a good part of Russia  weapons
Russia has so much destruction  it will take many years to replace all rthe lost and that doesn't  even cover the human lost which will never be recovered
Why would Ukraine agree to Russia 🇷🇺 is done the banks had cut them off with the banks had cut them off they can only survive for 6 months at the most if that
Leaving Ukraine and paying damages is the best condition
The west wants this war. Nukes are being sent to England today. Possibly Poland by the end of the week. Add to that NATO aircraft transponders have been off since September 21st and the US shut down theirs yesterday.  Globalists never let a good crisis go to waste. Look for a false flag attack or just a straight forward attack.  Every time Russia has attempted to end this (they've tried several times) they've suffered some kind of attack. The ship at the beginning, pipelines, the bridge, the Turkish pipelines, rocket attacks and now? This is happening even if Putin doesn't want it. What if this is just a ploy to get his people out of the area so he can nuke the area. Remember Russian forces retreated and then bombed the areas they left with rockets.  It's sad, we won't know.  The west has pretty much lied about everything and Putin isn't exactly the man of the year for being an honest politician.   Good luck surviving the winter
This guy is totally nuts. The more he bombs the more the free world will supply weapons . For instance, Italy just supplied air defense systems and 30 self propelled howitzer M109 Paladin. That is big! 30 heavy  tracked howitzer with 40 km range can crush a full russian division in 24 hours. Every day Ukraine armement becomes stronger and more technically advanced. Moreover the manpower ratio is 5 to 1 in favor of Ukraine, with superipr tactics and logistic and a morale advantage of 100 to 1. How the little creep thinks to win this war can only be explained by him having mental issues.
Ukrainian won’t do stop fighting and won’t do any agreement deal
So what was the point of this news? I could have told you that Putin has conditions to stop the war months ago !!!!!!
Who does that  tip rat think he is, pfffft
no way for putin demands
The check of Puten who does he think he is,Puten will end up distroying Russia completely  there is no way the Russia will end up winning this war
What is the demand or what are the demands ….
They wanna keep fighting what you talkin bout
Did not understand a word she said
Putin can not set condition because he is the aggressor,just simply leave Ukraine and pay damages, that's it
his demand can not be met. Ukraine got Himars.
Maybe we should demand that Russia gives Moscow and St Petersburg to Ukraine as compensation for Billions in damage and the killing of thousands of innocent people
Putin started the operation therefore  he must stop and vacate his troops out of Ukraine. That's how things should be. He cannot tell the people of Ukraine to stop the war as if they started the war. Putin must give all the places he occupied if there are back to the Ukranians.
He's dreaming like a princess in a castle. Just have pack his balls and get out of Ukraine ,no conditions. In fact even the previous annexation must be torn this time around.
Ukrainian soil.russian go home n the coflict is finish.
The invaders sets a condition? If Putin think the welfare of all people he wil stop the war. Putin has no word and nonsense President. If you are a good leader do not use your nuclear weapon to threaten countries. You know what is the horrible effect of your nukes. You must think the safety and lives of humanity.
Lol what's the conditions tho 😂😉
But You should  of know To wander if it is a  president  do annexe  worldwide  country with alongside constitution or without alongside     constitution    ?
To this end ,A judicious balance has been sought between  theory , empirical verification and policy considerations
Is this click bait, what are Russian demands?
Putin should end this.
Its dont work like this ,first widrow your army ,second send back the civilians you deport,Third send the children back who you stole from Ucraienna  mothers .
Again the same in other words. Which attack??? The retreat you want yo say. I speak to you in russian  you crazy, zelensky told you first fu** off than he fu**s you..... bye bye
Ukraine will end the war when russia leaves all of Ukraine every inch
The problem is that no one believed Erdogan outside of his countty

Unconditional surrender
No no no ulraine he started it now he is loosing the war go go  go ukrAine god is with you
Putin, do want his country distracted like we dont want  ours distracted,we want to love one another, like God loves us
Putin stop your fucking useless war..
Putin is in no position to dictate conditions. He will commit suicide.
They just need to flush Poo-tin!
It's quite easy really. Putin resigns to the inevitable and withdraws all invaders from Ukraine.
Putin cant set any terms he is the agresser.Ukraine need to make up more fire on him
Jesus was born to die so that you and I can live boldly born again.   Romans 10:9 If you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.
Yeah u best chill Putin cause your army sux on the battlefield
moscow condition is if you can catch the nuke without exploding...is that right Wion?
Gerald R. Ford.
People must acknowledge that Mr Putin is talking to NATO and NATO alone, technically the Ukrainian Army was defeated in the first weeks of the conflict,  the alleged Ukrainian "gains" are inconsequential and till now they been fighting the separatists, winter will descend along fresh Russian reinforcements
I think war monger Biden is not gonna stop because it's good business 🤣🤣🤣 and idiots Europeans doesn't know they are swords end even with immigration. Have you ever seen when West goes bombing Syria all immigration happens to Europe and US doesn't take anyone🤣🤣🤣
No conditions! He has to pay for damages and pay with his own life for all the Innocent people he murdered!
PEACE IS NEAR. ZELENSKY HOLDS THE ACE CARD MACRON MODI AND OTHERS CAN MEDIATE INDIA FRANCE ARE IN GOOD TERMS WITH PUTINS RUSSIA. I HOPE ZELENSKY REALIZES THAT EVEN IF HE IS RIGHT HE MUST TALK WITH PUTIN WITHOUT PRECONDITIONS PREJUDICE. SOMETIMES  DISCRETION IS THE BETTER PART OF VALOR
Sir President Putin I admire you I support you.
Honestly with this part, ukraine has fault for it. Ukraine could’ve accepted the demand from Russia and we would’ve avoided a ww3. But no ukraine government and elites don’t want no negotiations and nor peace so they continue to fight. But later on elites will point out that Russia don’t want peace and nothing is gonna happen for peace blah blah blah.
Simple!
ukraine and the world will send russia back to the 1920s
So Russia is losing but they want demands?
YOUR CONDITION NOBODY WILL ACCEPT
Good mr putin
May peace prevail ❤
Hell no, Russia getting his ass kicked and has fucking nerve to set conditions. What, thinks Ukraine RETARDED
What is this beautiful news reader name? I think she is an Indian beauty.  Excellent job please keep it up. God bless.
what are the demands … i’m guessing for the same demands they stated previously for ukraine to be neutral country and for the annexed regions to be recognized by the un which the evil godless west will never agree to and will tell Ukraine to never accept these demands so that their lust for armageddon can be full filled
Putin should made an uncondional durrender to ukraine president and lay down his armament s to be turned over to unkrsine president. And pledge loyalty to ukrain e never to invade other coubtriries again.
Strange, what is the real reason he wants to stop fighting?
My analysis is! Putin the president of Russia is at the strong position today's world wars orders and the economy crisis
😢
Russia has no Rights to set terms or conditions but to get the Hell out of Ukrainean  borders and face the blunt of The United Nations
I haven't seen a jew run like that since Poland 1942
So Putin want to legalized stilling🤔  God Putin said if you not obey me I will still your home🖕
The most obvious condition to be met for ending this war is for Putin to get his jo-jo's out of Ukraine. Expecting Ukraine to kneel down before him and start sucking is a sign of how crazy he is. He should have come out of the closet many years ago instead of now taking out his repressed resentment in his old age.
Now that you exhausted all your missiles,you want cease-fire,wait for Ukraine's counter attact
You have no right to put conditions
Putler wants Ukrainian neutrality (no NATO membership), Crimea, Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, Luhansk, and Donetsk oblasts. All of which the Ukrainians will reject. The war won't end until Ukraine recovers these oblasts and the Russians get rid of Putler.
He's drunk... allegedly. Russia should STOP the attack on Ukraine. Russia invaded Ukraine (it's NOT Ukraine that invaded/nor fought Russia). Ukraine is merely defending itself and its citizens. 😒😒😒
Guess things didn’t workout for Putiman.
Great leader
HE IS NOT IN A POSITION TO MAKE ANY CONDITION....PUDDING HAS TO LISTEN TO UKRAINE'S SET OF CONDITIONS....AND FURTHERMORE!!!....
I AM GUESSING..TO REMOVE NATO FORCES FROM AROUND UKRAINE AND UKRAINE CAN'T JOIN NATO..WHICH NATO IS USELESS ANYWAY..
It's better than nothing.. Do it Ukraine??
Here is a good condition for Peace…………1. Russia leaves Ukraine 2. Return all Annex Territory to Ukraine 3. It’s just that Simple no wonder Putin doesn’t understand!
Hes da one attacking ukraine a!and demands to stop Ukraine wheew crazy old nuts !!!🥶🥶🥶🥶making peoples lices in miserable vry dis gracrfull leaders 🤮😱😈
Usa dont want the ukraine to stop. Anyway both are making money. It raines modern weapons on ukraine, usa likes to see russians being killed... this war was provoqued so.. why put an end to it
WION!!!! I ONCE LIKED/LOVED YOUR CHANNEL, the Indian people's are traitors! Get your weapons from the Bear,fine! Àbstain from the un vote?? Cowards! Maybe someone should take your country over.
He will say to people living in occupied territories to protect their country from the invasion of the enemy... 😄😂😂
How about:  1. Russia leaves Donbas and Crimea  2. Pays to rebuild  3. Pays money to families of people Russia murdered  4. Russia disarms warheads
So what are their demands? This video was a waste of my time
What are the demands?!? Lol
always the winning side who puts condition to the war..
6 months old video
Why this fucking old news popped up in September  2022?
What a farce this video is . . . they don't even tell us what the "conditions" are. I wonder, do they know? . . . . . . . .
Putin is talking to himself ! , the Ukrainians will not stop until the Putin's army has with drawn from all of Ukrain back over the Russia boarder,  then Putin will be listened to . Otherwise Putin is in a empty room talking to himself and no one is listening and now one there for him to talk to. This looks like Putin is trying to save face from a disaster of his own making, and then he will call it a victory .
Mr.Putin Ukraine territories should be returned and compensation should be given to them for losses they suffered and you should be feeling sorry for the loss of life and the misery of the people of Ukraine!
pretty sure Ukraine is already Destroyed both ways since their economic was not doing well before the war started
Russia giving up
Turn the gas off Vlad
To me Ukraine is a place where people have no value for life women are treated like nothing illegal wicked cutely activities been done to people and no one can say anything about it but I think Russian are doing a great job that what I think see that the media is covering up everything about Ukraine NAZI president
Putin is in Intense Delusion. He started the War with Ukraine. Who is he to dictate to Ukraine??? He can join the Ranks of Bullies of Fat Xi, Uncouth and Empty Headed Wang Yi along with the Fat Boy from North Korea.
Poo Poo Putin.
It's foolishness,where could you heard that a losser will set a conditions,just simply withdraw all troops and pay damages, that's all
wow not about to happen get ready for nukes
Same alibi from Putin....Military Operation...for what?????once you attack another country...it's invasion...bullshit alibi...He is Lunatic...
НАТО, прекрати пичкать Украину оружием и конфликт прекратится. США нужна эта война, чтобы ослабить Россию.
The only conditions are for Russia to get out of Ukraine now!
6 months later and we see how big of a LIE this turned out to be
L'Ukraine doit tenir bon, la russie va s'incliner, car poutine sera tué !  La pression sur lui est immense, le peuple a arrêter d'être aveugle !
Who gonna listen to puttin? He is a shameless criminal
Has anyone stopped at rubbing just the tip?
Ukraine doesn't want to settle on terms so Russia is clear to destroy the hole country and this is what zalensky, nato and America want.
This will work out great for Russia if this goes through because they can initiate the second phase of the agenda New world order and please do not include the United States in that make United States stay separate in NATO
Putin can not give any conditions
Do you really think He is in a position to demand that they stop before he stops, I think He's crazy?????
Good
What are the demands....with out mentioning the demand or anything what a wonderful coverage
If Russia fall..half of Russia belong to ukraine
Putin trying to find a way out lol.
putins desperate and who is moscow to make demands 😂
War will not stop because America still wow to give more support to Ukraine . Its shows that America wants to keep Russia in trouble. America is not thinking about condition of Ukraine's people.
He’s going to die
They had been living in peace till that tyrant started the war
That bum putin got his nerve he is the asshole who invaded and started that war
No condition needed just quietly exit in Ukrain then pay the damages
Only one job the world needs the journalists to do is tell us why Russia had to do this. The media fail to deliver.  You have to find the truth privately, what a shame
Ukraine won't stop fighting until Russia leave Ukraine.. Putin is getting desperate!.... Ukraine have only just begun the counter attack!!!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 💩🩲 Putin Will stop when Putin's demands are met..... seriously????😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂
Ukrainians will keep chewing the inept potato farmers up and their equipment
I don't think the Ukrainians are amused or in any mood to meet Putin's demands after what he pulled. I think they would rather die first.
Thats Good News
And what are those demands?
Satan evil Putin should pay Russian and Ukraine death and for killing Ukraine people
He is  the  one that started the war  not the  Ukraine
This popped up on my news feed today like it was breaking news. 🤦‍♂️ 8 months later 😂
Depends on Putin's demands...which will probably be denied. imo
Absolutely amazing that you can invade another country and demand territory. Unbelievable!
the eu uk us need a way to hide the vaccine bodies ... pretending to send and lose men is next
great news coverage i feel like this was literally 30 words put on playback...also why not state the conditions?
What sort of agreement is that. He is pretty much saying he will cease the invasion if Ukrain surrender. FGS
First America and its Western allies stop supplying weapons to zelensky and pay the compensation for the loss of Russian army and the expenses caused by the Comedian zelensky's Ukraine.  Secondly,  sorry for instigated Comedian actor made president by America, against Russia and wage war against Russia and further assure not to repeat it again.  Is it ok wion media.
for Ukraine is only chances to fight till they recover all their territory and fight to last other ways history going to repeat, also it's time to pay back for  1932/1933 3,300 000/5,000 000 Ukrainians starved to death  1946/1947 around 6,000 000/10,000 000 that's the way they was liberated
What are the demands .. §§§§
and Russia leaves Syria and take the Chinless ophthalmologist with him. And Karydorov too!
Russia should not bother to sign a peace agreement. The minsk-agreement had shown how untrustworthy the West and Ukrain is.
What!!!! why don't  they just pullout of UKRAIN. So Ukranian will Return And have a peaceful life.
Russia shall cut Ukraine from outside world
Pressure must be getting to him 🤡
It’s because Russia is losing and Putin knows it.
It's only a matter of time before Putin strikes the United States..
Reasonable? Don't you realise Ukraine used to have nuclear weapons but was lied to dismantle the program with the so called "reasonable demands?" When he is thinking of cease fire, it means the war is exacting a heavy toll on the Russian side.
They need to take Putin out! he is a peace of    crap
Here's the condition, get out. :p
The fighting will end when Russia gets out of Ukraine.
Russia must just leave Ukraine or be pushed out.
Coward Putin smell  worst defeat.declare conditions?Ukraine can take half of Russia
Sounds like a one sided deal.  You kicked my ass but I will pull back of you give me territory.  Joke
Retreat  and leave pooptin..
Putin will end the war if Ukraine will kiss his behind.
What are Moscows demands? lmao you need to include that if you want to call these breaking news!
This is bull.putin wants all of Ukraine.if given into them he's going to start in other places.same thing Hitler did.they invaded, there should be no demands meet for Putin.can barely handle what Ukraine as it is.If we actually invaded back Russia would loose even with china.this is him bullying cause china over there supposedly war games.isnt that what Putin said before invading.come on now.
Rubbish.. What demands????????????????????????
I think he should end the war in Ukraine and also have all foreign element out of Syria.
🇷🇸📿☝️ tekbir
UKRAINE SHOULD GRAB PUTIN'S OFFER OF PEACE IN WRITING AND AGREE TO MOSCOW DEMAND AND NOT DANCE TO NATO ANTICS  BECAUSE RUSSIA IS A NUCLEAR POWER ,A COUNTRY RULED BY JUST ONE MAN. AND IF. UKRAINE BECOME A REAL PAIN IN THE ASS THE RUSSIANS WILL STOP THIS WAR WITH ONE OR TEO NUKE SIMILAR TO THE WAY AMERICANS DID IN JAPAN TO STOP THE WAR WITH JAPAN  ,END RESULT WILL BE E Q U A L  TO  BETWEEN USA AND RUSSIA AND THE COMEDIAN  Vladimir ZULENSKY WILL BECOME A CLOWN TO ALL IKRANIANS WHO VOTE HIM TO MAKE POLITICIAN OUT OF HIM
😅🤣😂🤣🤣😅 putin is really sick!
What are the conditions please?
Need not set conditions,just call up all Russians soldiers home and allow U N peace keepers to settle in
What about Turkey invation in Syria?
Stop it right now Putin because Ukraine will never give up there country to you mad man, 98 percent of world is on Ukraine side in the beginning it was going well for you, but you and your soldiers are not laughing now they running like wild animal
Russia will lose one hundred miles of Asian territory for each inch they steal in Ukraine. Free Siberia, Outer Manchuria and Kuril Islands.
The ignorant little Hitler want to be, he doesn't set crap, Ukraine sets conditions. And he knows what they are.
So wait, their argument is, "we invaded you, unprovoked, yet we refuse to stop attacking you until you stop trying to defend yourself"...?  These aren't very intelligent men who are in these Positions of Power, are they?  Shame...
Before it ends and if it does please Russia fire a missile at zenlensky house in Ukraine. It's only fair
Aggressors can not present demands
Putin can not give conditions
Why didn't she tell us Russian demands.
Just when I thought the war is about to end only for me to find out more Russian troops are gonna be killed 😔😔
Putin can not set conditions as he start the war
Russia must leave u kraine and there must be no negotiations he started the war so he must go back to his own country he  is in no position to dictate terms
Tell putin to get stuffed..
Piss on putin and his punktins, you've already lost the dumbass
Stop fighting? U.S just sent 3 billion dollars worth of weapons to Elensky.
Hahahahaha, Putin iz getting dezperate. Hahahahaha, Ztupid Lozer.......Lonely Pariah.......
How about Adolf putin stop fighting first,  pull all his gangsters out of Ukraine then talk.
Putin Sir GooD 🙏🇱🇰🌟🌟 02 China Xi Jinping Sir Ok 🙏🇨🇳🇱🇰8👑❤
Putin knows he's winning. He has at least 25% of Ukraine. Europe is having an energy crisis. He's playing a strong hand.
YES and what are Moscow's demands?
Putin condition is Ukraine will not invade Russia.
Yep stop the war and stay warm. lots of daft people here.
Moscow is in no position to be placing demand on anyone, much less Ukraine. Russia is the war criminal. Do not negotiate with the terrorist Putin
How about ukraine condition? Ukraine should set condition not moscow or putin...
Kapal talaga itong mga  tga europa

Everyone please prey that Ukraine will agree on this outstanding remarkable change in Putin I'm so proud of you Mr. Putin good for you!😂😂🤗🤗💙💙
Hell no run them out and destroy his army
What  a  nut case
Indian scammers keep on supporting this morron
Putin you are not in place to ask or set a condition, you are a MURDERER, you're sick and can't think good for your country and the world, much better for you to step down.
Insane!
As long as Ukraine is emboldened by USA through military support,  this war will not end
is he serious dam Ukraine should not trust this stupid want to be
NOTHING FOR RUSSIA.   VERYTHING FOR UKRAINE.  DEAL OR NO DEAL. ???   PUTIN YOUR PEOPLE ARE GOING TO REMOVE QUICKLY,  VERY VERY SOON.
Lol terrorist Putin has demands hahaha 🤣, does it include his permeant retirement 6 feet under?
Putin's demise by his own people is inevitable. He is trying to prolong it by throwing cannon fodder to the frontlines and using Rosstat to hide the truth of the economy. But it is written, it shall be.
Aggressor does not have the right to put condition ,they can leave on Ukraine's soil without any conditions
My demands are "The same as I said at the start"
No one will trust Putin. One condition from Ukraine is Russia will pull out all his military from Ukraine territory including from Crimea and will not interfere on Ukraine joining NATO.
This really is not going to end well - for Russia. It is rather like watching a wounded animal caught by the leg in a bear trap chewing it’s own leg off.
Ukraine is no longer fighting……. Is kicking but!…… ALL OVER!  Putin can fight if he wants to!
No conditions…….. !out¡…… now!
It sounds like the she's saying the same thing over and over.
Puking is in no condition to set terms...Ukraine can...get off Ukrainian soil or die here
This is a worthless video. What are the demands.
In other words, nothing has changed.
Tsk tsk tsk!!!
It is Ukrainians Who set Conditions against Russia if Russian Want s to End the War...
Putin priority policy will never ever work against Ukraine  and within European countries.  The people elected leader  have not brought any good  role model for being ruling all these   years.  Its high time he had to be step down from his frustration that keeps the Russian people life becoming danger. People raise up for peace in your nation.
No to Russia,we cannot give in to the Russian Nazi thugs.
LOSERS DONT HAVE DEMANDS
Don’t believe one word Putin says.
What bullshit. See Yemen…see Gaza. See Africa.
Peace agreements with Ukraine mean absolutely nothing. They admitted to only signing the Minsk accords to buy time and further militarise over the following 8 years.
He's never going to stop the war as long as he thinks he has a chance... has that Stalin mentality and numbers don't matter.
If he is considering ending the war it is because he feels the pressure from the Russian people, Russians are struggling after the economic sanctions from the west and if Germany finds the way to become more independent from Russia’s gas by the end of 2022 the situation in Russia is going to be worse, that put at risk his own head and he knows it. Unemployment is high and lack of certain foreign products that are essential for the Russian people and economy are a reality that He didn’t want to consider before, on top of that thousands of dead young Russians soldiers, big losses on military equipment etc. and on top of all that risking to lose the occupied territories including Crimea. I think it is too late to accept his offer, if this war is going to end it has to be under the Ukrainian terms and conditions that include get back all the occupied territories and payment from Russia for all damages and reconstruction and for Putin to be judged eventually in an international curt of law.
Putin has no right to set any demands, he is completely out of line. They are nothing but COWARDS, they do not fight like men but attack civilians instead, they are a disgrace to the human race! Rant over!
Ukraine has their own demand that is: GTFO!!!  🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦 (from all territories, including Crimea)
AND WE ALL PRAY FOR THE END OF ALL TERRORISIM THROUGHOUT OUR 🙏 WORLD 🌎 !!! SO SPREAD LOVE 💘💕 AND PEACE ✌❤ !!!
WE HOPE THE DEMANDS OF RUSSIA 🇷🇺🙏 ARE WITHIN REASON, AND MR. PRES. VLADIMIR PUTIN, YOU WILL BE A RED ROSE 🌹😉 IF YOU CAN BRING PEACE, A RED ROSE STANDS FOR FRIENDSHIP, AND YOU WILL ALSO BE A JEWEL IN MY EYES 👀 A DIAMOND 💎,  IF YOU AND UKRAINE CAN GAIN MUTUAL AGREEMENTS, I HAVE THE FAITH IN YOU MR. PRES. VLADIMIR PUTIN, YOU CAN DO IT, O YEAH, I LOVED SEEING YOU WITH THE TEENAGERS, THE CHILDREN ON THE SHORT VEDIO. O YEAH, AND I WOULD LOVE 2 C THE PASSIONATE PUTIN WITH A CANDLE LIGHT DINNER WITH YOUR WIFE, KEEP HER HAPPY 😊 !!!
What are Moscow’s demands???
Why wasted our time,  WHAT are the conditions?
BOTH OF THEM ARE CRIMINALS!!!!!!¡ AND NO BODY SHOULD TRUST THEM!!!!!!
"UNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER"
Tell them to shove it.
Putin get out of Ukraine
Maybe Ukraine sets conditions not to invade Russia.
Erdogan is a joke himself
Putin is looking for a way out, there is no way out Putin, you murdered to many people, they want revenge.
For Ukraine there is only one condition; GET OUT!!!  At this stage, when it's obvious that Russia has lost, they are in no position to be making demands.
He is really for hell, move over Hitler you hopefully have company soon?
Number 1 condition is for Putin to be put in jail
[ PUTTING ]  , JUST LOST , HIS BABY DATHERE TO A CAR EXPLOTION ? .WERES ? (  THE NEWS ON THAT ? )  .🤬....
Can’t trust the Russians, before invading Putin said we’re not invading
Putin's demands: Stop resisting the invasion, let us destroy Ukraine and slaughter its people. And then and only then will he stop the war.
What a complete ass that’s wrong!
Si hace tiempo esta perdiendo,no ha logrado nada....que condiciones va a poner?.......solo le queda sacar a todos los soldados rusos de Ucrania,incluyendo Crimea.........y Putiiin ser llevado a la corte internacional por crimenes salvajes de guerra,y lesa humanidad...ser condenado a muerte.......ESO SOLO LE QUEDA.....al ZAR loco de Rusia.........no tiene alternativa...seguira.....hasta que algun  patriota que ame a Rusia,le ponga fin.....Slava Ucrania......Venga tu Reino FDios..........
Blood on Putins hands. Life will will sort him out.  Let's see what his fate will be...
Whar the heck could  Putins conditions be? Only to please him?
Volodymyr Zelensky, Monday: Challenge Russia. Tuesday: Condemn Putin Wednesday: Losing territory Thursday: Cry for help. Friday: Meeting with Bomba Biden and Biden’s NATO. Saturday: Want more war. Sunday: Ukraine Presidential Psychiatric Examination.
How
What happened in 2014 what was happening in eastern Ukraine since 2014. There is so much you did not include in your reporting and there is more with the nato expansion. I am not pro Russia but the truth is the truth. What is the truth the war machine !!! Everyday of my life ( 48 years old ) the United States has been shooting or bombing someone this has to end.
Yeah, until Russia get out of whole Ukraine’s territory period 🇺🇦🇺🇸💪
Putins demand will not granteed because he want to take whole ukrane under his dectatoship and original ukranian canot accept that only russians going there to  lived accept that demand.putins demand is favor to him onlt
Russia Surrenders , they have no more Ammo and have failed to Annex Ukraine
NEVER!!!!
Well after all he is in such a strong position. Good luck Putler.
Go to h e l l  tiny man .  You stole 1/3rd of federal economy of russia betting on failure 2008  and  got that money flagged and compromising Senate with nra maria butina money that ended renewal of sanctions . Now putin got that money thanks to treason in US senate and now ukraine banks holding the stake accounts left behind by epstien is putins quest to control . Lawmaker kept his ill gotten gains frozen  now ots putins turn and innocent people are still dying includingbthose fighting over a dictstors ego to punish the west  who through nazi law targeting lehman brothers caused all of this  two wars included.  3  floors or lehman were 911 real targets . Making a boogie man out of islam when extremists were just inspired to eliminate the obstacles  just means wealth betting on us to fail was just sent here to do the nasty work .
He’s going to run Russia to the ground! We in USA couldn’t be happier 👍👍👍
It's like saying , i'll stop eating your chocolate bar only if you remove the cocoa in it.
Yaaa
Why is this out of date video being shown as if it is new - it's long out of date
it's only game or gambit.short term .....only.inpact of full power is preparing.....story Abt young wolodia   chasing rat.until rat going to wall and abruptly turned to chasing wolodia.await ....it's coming
No condition acceptable.  No demand you can claim Putin.  You are looser. You started invasion,  you are in wrong side of coins
What Russia wants is complete control over Ukraine, why should Ukraine lose it's independence.
The reasons of joining peace talks by both is an example that both sail equally.Erdogan changed Sophia Cathedral one of 5th Century world heritage in to mosque 2months back. Russia bombed churches,schools and hospitals.The Joke is when Russia is chased out of Ukraine fiercely, Russia sets terms to withdraw. The judicial terms to Russia would be to compensate losses of humans,structures and Agri lands.
Putin needs to leave Ukraine if it wants fighting to stop.
As helpful Democrats, we can offer Putin all Trump Republicans to fight in his Army in Ukraine. These are well seasoned fighters, having experience in their attack on our Capital. These tough Republicans are made up of women, young and old, cut-throats, former soldiers, and Cops, and evil members of the KKK , Neo-Nazis, the Proud Boys, the Oath Keepers, and any other self-proclaimed member of a White Supremacists group. They have solid credentials. And we can throw in Sean Hannity to clamor as a Putin General, along with many members of Republican Senators and Congressman. They will make Putin proud, and Putin does need a new round of recruits, while ridding America from it's problem.
cap who leaks the phone conversations?
These demands by Putin are unrealistic. He invaded a sovereign country and wants that country to stop fighting blah blah blah. Putin should first get out of Ukraine (as before February 2022 invasion). Issues on discussion should be Crimea
THIS IS A START IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION FOR EVERYONE. PEACE 🙏 AND GUIDANCE 🙏 ONE LOVE 💕 WE GET THERE TOGETHER.
They used to thought war was for African  and Middle East. You guys should not stop it now is too early .nonsense you people should test it too
Turkey - we can help.  India - me too. I buy more Russian oil, gas and vodka at discounted prices. Ukraine? What's Ukraine?
What's his demand . His got the gots to demand when he ruen Ukrane? Special operation with blowing up hospitals children's schools and killings enosent people? Now he's got the nerve to demand. JUST SORENDER TO UKRANE  And fix all what you have been distroyed in Ukrain.,
Ukraine now has Russia by the balls, Putin can see defeat looming and he is getting desperate, he has gone from absolutley refusing to negotiate at all to now "setting conditions". Zelensky wont stop squeezing until he wants, hes won, Russia cant win and will lose Crimea while they may gain a part of the Donbas. Although , even that is doubtful, Zelensky doesnt strike me as a forgiving man and may well choose to continue this until Russia is exhausted. 20,000 RA soldiers in the South under siege slowly being starved. Its a lesson the Japanese learned in Kokoda, and the Germans learnt in Russia and have forgotten, logistics, logistics, logistics. While the Russians were throwing the majority of their forces at Donbas trying to gain useless open ground in a region they already held the UA was setting up the South for encirclement. This has now also given Ukraine the opportunity to train half a million soldiers with western help. When the UA decides to engage their forces it will be swift and decisive.
you could have said all that in less than 10 seconds instead of two minutes of dragging it out repeatedly
In other words, surrender. These aren’t terms, they’re demand. That’s a big no from Zelensky, Putin must be brain dead. Nobhead
Putin is not in a position to dictate conditions. Ruzzia is Lozing.....Ukraine will defeat Ruzzia.....Putin will pay for his war crimes.
Under our apostle Paul’s ministry,today we are only saved by BELIEVING The Gospel of Jesus Christ,1 st Corinthians Chapter 15 verse 1-4.Jesus Christ died on the cross for our sins,was buried,and rose again on the third day.Jesus Christ Shed Blood is what saves you when you believe this plan of salvation with your heart.
As long  you view  means to end the war you are doing good  for humanity. War is never  good.  It should  be avoided  by whatever  means. All countries should not keep  war weapons because  as long as we are armed  we will be eager to get to war relaying  on our weapons. Are we not obliterating  the beauty of joy and peace by war? Instead we bring suffering  misery  destruction and death out of war. Surely there no pleasure in that
Do you have a story here or did you forget to tell it? I got no more from the story than I did the headline.
Bravo Vladimir Vladimirovič!
SORRY PUTINO YOU AND YOUR SOLGER GET OUT UCRAIN THEN WE TOKIN”ZELENSKY THE PRESIDEN 🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦SEID🫵🫵🫵🫵🫵🫵🫵🫵
Just realised it is 5 month old this item  what has it  accomplished
Putin can end the war he can Surrender
Aggressors can not negotiate for conditions,they must exit and pay damages
Let's give Putin another chance come on  guys one more chance so he can build his ARMY AGAIN  and STICK IT TO YOU AGAIN  !
THE  MAN  HAS  BONE  FOR  BRAINS.THERE  IS  ONE  CONDITION.  GET  OUT FROM  MY HOMELAND.       ITS  LIKE  A  BANK  ROBBER PROMISING  HE  WILL  BE   A  GOOD  BOY  IF  YOU  DO  NOT  CALL  THE    POLICE.
Not for him to set conditions.... he's a tyrant and must be stood up to.....no surrender they must withdraw
If Putin wants to end the war with conditioon.   So there is no peace since communist never kept their words So keep fighting until they leave without any condition so.   The peace is forever
The only thing Putin can do is to give himself up to face a trial for criminal Acts to his own people and ukraines you media people you're so full of s*** he wants to make amends what because he's losing that means he's supposed to get off scot-free I don't think so he wants to make amends to tell him to give himself up along with his gremlin allies and everybody that stands behind him none of them is good you think because one man says something that you're supposed to drop and let everything happen that's a bunch of b******* all the criminal people need to be taken out along with Putin all in jail along with the oligars and anybody else that supports his ass what a bunch of joke asses you people are and your meaty ass f****** b******* you put on here they need to be taking new people to court as well
Putin  you pathetic little man nobody cares what you want anymore you are responsible for deaths of thousands of your own soldiers and the Ukrainian people and if there is any justice in the world you be held accountable
There is no probkem if putin aggression to continue the war russia  is the loser
See how easy it is to end this If only Zelinski would stop thiis  illegal Occupation and terrorist resistance. But let's be honest Zelinski is a actor  looking for a stage to perform
Putin is disgusting, same as hitler, Stalin
No don't end defeat them they don't have enought equipment anymore Russia must lose and bankcrupt
You don't felt stupid talking lies as a reporter spark tention all around the world and you say proud to lie just like American? Shame on you indian women.. it's going to heat you back!
Wretched Er Do Gan
The world must pummel the Satans, the savages of Russia  the murdering occupying animals, into the dirt rubbing their face in the dirt and decimating them
Tell Putin get his ass out of Ukraine, Crimea, Belorussia! He's  the aggressor, tell him kiss a butt & get the hell out.
War makes no sense.
what bloody conditions!
President Putin should ask America a Direct Question. Did American commit a war crime by using Army advisers to fire the Himark missiles at the Nuclear power plant, at Russian soldiers.  America is setting a new precedent, by firing missiles at Russian soldiers in Ukraine. Putin needs to confront America ASAP.
We all know that gonna re grou0 and Fuel and attack again..
Ukraine first has to stop fighting?
Putin have his nerve, now that he's losing he still wants to be the big dog....When he's the dog chasing his tail!!!! Ukraine is holding all the cards, and should demand conditions from Russia; like paying to rebuild Ukraine's economy....
USA AND NATO  ARE WAR CRIMINALS  THAT ONLY SMOKED CIVILIANS  IN LIBYA, YUGOSLAVIA, SERBIA, IRAQ, AFGHANISTAN, YEMEN  AND SYRIA . NOW ITS BEING BROUGHT UP .WHEN A REAL WAR BEGINS   THEY RUN 😂
There's 2 nations that bend over to the USA  1. Phillipines  2. India
USA and UK are the world problem leaders...
Long live RUSSIA and mr PUTIN
Wtf does Putin think he is ? He has gone too far. The world will not tolerate his insanity anymore.
Dont believe Putin u go in there and want to stop get out of there an pay to fix back the place . worm
And here it is Now 5 Months Later.... And.....
It's so pointless NATO should be held to account what they have done is unforgivable, LGB
Crazy man this Putin! Ukraine must stop fighting and he calls this war an operational exercise? Really, killing civilians, destroying cities, raping women are no an exercise? Wow, that will give everybody in the world permission to attack anybody, kill people and calls it an exercise! Only a mad man will believe such rubbish! Europe must attack Russia, as Putin is a danger to Europe!
结束俄乌战争只有一个条件，即立即撤出北约-美国军队和从乌克兰提供后勤保障.🇷🇺🇹🇼👍
What a condition! Russia must pay the prize of what it has initiated.
Why Putin thinks he is in a position to demand anything from the Ukrainians is beyond me.
No contract  Whit  pouttinn
Now here is a chance to stop this law I'll what are we going to do not take the chance I mean wouldn't it be nice if we didn't have any more water and Ukraine I think we should listen to him
He wants to have a way out but this is not it lmao what a bird!
No deal lmao russian go home , get out of all ukraine….world power??? Hahahahahahahaha they are a joke
Sick man of Europe
Ja está derretendo
the only promise Russians keep is when they promised to kill
Russia's word is no good they don't keep their word
do what Russia says or  they will keep murdering
what good is a Russian signature so freaking what they don't keep their word they took nuclear weapons from Ukraine and promised to never invade their liars and murderers
that's what it is an assault all they're doing is what they should not be doing they're murdering ukrainians that's all it is don't use the word all that's what it is it is what it is Russia is guilty of murder
He doesn't have to « set conditions ». He is a dictator, an ass*ole, a murderer and now an invader caveman and a shame to Humanity. Just get out of Ukraine, let's deputinise the world. And I don't need to read reply from underpaid trolls.
One condition, Putin pulls his forces out of Ukraine, and hands himself over to fave war crimes.
Putin take your filthy troops out of the Ukraine...they do not meet your demands..maybe time for a nursing home for u putin
"Stop fighting so that we can just have it, then it won't be an invasion anymore." - V.P.
Don’t trust Vladimir Putin
Is it not because tables are tilting in Kyiv 's favour
Its Putins game to gain time & restruture  his  tired soldiers  he drove too far there  is no turning back now  but  continue driving with 🇺🇦 with the help of friends .
Very nice way to say "I am screwed, but cant give up my ego".
Ha ! This psychopath signed his death-certificate on the day he sent young and old Russians to kill innocent people in Ukraine.
Clickbait WION is in line with all other media now
What kinda dumb answer Putin I putting out there. Is He's brain dead
JUST GO HOME WITH YOUR TROOPS AND NEVER COME BACK TO UKRAINE, AND PAY FOR ALL THE DAMAGE YOUR TROOPS HEVE DONE 🪖
Get out of Ukraine and we will stop fighting.
why does erdogan even give him a hand ....a child murderer....dont need talks anymore
Po tani mbasi vrave me mijra njerez te pafajshem?? Ti duhesh varur ne mes te moskes??
Point of correction, it's not an invasion, it's a special military operation.
Putin: get ready to meet your maker.
Get out and we'll cease firing.
Trying to end a war that they started. Does anybody else see the irony in that. Never made sense to begin with
Too much BS with no trust
Being big super power why conditions...not capable of occupying ukraine 🦓 zelosky comedian
Maybe it’s to protect his sorry Russian ass.
No continúe fitting.
Lol just realised its 5months old
I will say this Putin he's not bluffing this time he is serious the choice is yours but Putin's not playing around he means what he says if you don't accept his terms he will take the rest of Ukraine to complete devastation so you have a choice you can negotiate with Putin and remove the sanctions that have been placed upon him and his country or you can face the wrath of rejecting his offer this one I let you choose it is not right that others have crippled his nation with sanctions if someone had disrespected me in that way I would have taken you to war also it's time you start to care about all countries and not just you and your friends the choice is yours on this one if you accept or refuse the offer but you are well aware of the consequences on both decisions
Putin cannot demand anything. He lies as much as Trump and turns around and does more war crimes. Ukraine has won the war everyone has to wait til Putin is put on trial for ordering war crimes.
STOP THE WAR...
"We started this war with actually no purpose just because Russia is paranoid about the NATO, but we like to stop it now it is not going with our plans. Is it okay, we are providing peaceful solution, we are so kind. . please, you must be a war monger if you do not accept our terms. . + other BS "
The conditions are clear, Russia will rule all of Ukraine and then move on to other countries.
In other words Putin wants Ukraine to surrender when he’s not in a position to demand anything from a independent country like Ukraine.
Russia must compensate to Ukraine and  China must compensate to World Countries on Coronavirus Spreading  !😀
Ukrainian 's  no deal with Russia fight till you take your country back 100 percent of it. God Bless the Ukrainian. 🇺🇦
Ukraine should make the condition since Russia is losing the war
What are the demands.
Zalensky doesn't want to end the war
Slava Ukraini!
The only demand you mentioned Putin speak of was stop fighting ? Is that the only demand Putin spoke of ?.this media coverage is uninformative filled with unnecessary commentary lacking facts .
Dialogue  is the best way forward.
Old news
I know English is not my cup of tea but I have not heard any conditions set by Putin in your reporting.
So what are the conditions? This is a poor job reporting. Normally you guys do a great job informing. What the hell happened this time ?
what are the demands and conditions from Putin?  I didn't hear what the conditions and demands!!
Not much of an option stop fighting and submit to the demands of Putin if Ukraine's sovereignty is lost without the right to defend it there is no telling who is going to be the next target with viable resources 🙉🙈🙊
They’re not “Sanctions” they’re special economic conditions.
The time has come for, us in the West, to be asking if our (so-called) democracy has outlived its usefulness, in delivering security to our lives? Once again, as we have seen in the past, power-mad dictators are able threaten our lives, because they do not need the approval of the people they have under their control. Yes, the same can be said about the way we are lied to by our people, but at least our leaders must keep future elections in mind, which is why we have to sit back and allow ourselves to be threatened with annihilation, every day, and we must take it? While the dictators grow stronger in belligerence with every passing day. It may be nice to console ourselves that our leaders are being responsible by not provoking the irresponsible mad men facing us. However, is it an irrational responsibility that in the end will leave us in a world where we will be forever allowing the deranged to dominate everything in our lives?  To take, as their derangement grows (as it surely will) anything they desire to boost their egos. “You may have to fight when there is no hope of victory, because it is better to perish than live as slaves” : Winston Churchill.
The truth is.. Putin is running out of soldiers and weapons
WHY AMERICANS LEADERS WANT THE MARKET FOR THEMSELVES ONLY WHY ONLY AMERICA CAN BE ECONOMICALLY RICH  NO ONE ELSE CAN ONLY YOU PEOPLE
[11:84] And unto Midian (We sent) their brother Shu’eyb. He said: O my people! Serve Allah. Ye have no other God save Him! And give not short measure and short weight. Lo! I see you well-to-do, and lo! I fear for you the doom of a besetting Day.  [11:85] O my people! Give full measure and full weight in justice, and wrong not people in respect of their goods. And do not evil in the earth, causing corruption.  [11:86] That which Allah leaveth with you is better for you if ye are believers; and I am not a keeper over you.  [11:87] They said: O Shu’eyb! Doth thy way of prayer command thee that we should forsake that which our fathers (used to) worship, or that we (should leave off) doing what we will with our own property. Lo! thou art the mild, the guide to right behaviour.  [11:88] He said: O my people! Bethink you: if I am (acting) on a clear proof from my Lord and He sustaineth me with fair sustenance from Him (how can I concede aught to you) ? I desire not to do behind your backs that which I ask you not to do. I desire naught save reform so far as I am able. My welfare is only in Allah. In Him I trust and unto Him I turn (repentant).  [11:89] And, O my people! Let not the schism with me cause you to sin so that there befall you that which befell the folk of Noah and the folk of Hud, and the folk of Salih; and the folk of Lot are not far off from you.  [11:90] Ask pardon of your Lord and then turn unto Him (repentant). Lo! my Lord is Merciful, Loving.  [11:91] They said: O Shu’eyb! We understand not much of that thou tellest, and lo! we do behold thee weak among us. But for thy family, we should have stoned thee, for thou art not strong against us.  [11:92] He said: O my people! Is my family more to be honoured by you than Allah ? and ye put Him behind you, neglected! Lo! my Lord surroundeth what ye do.  [11:93] And, O my people! Act according to your power, lo! I (too) am acting. Ye will soon know on whom there cometh a doom that will abase him, and who it is that lieth. And watch! Lo! I am a watcher with you.  [11:94] And when Our commandment came to pass We saved Shu’eyb and those who believed with him by a mercy from Us; and the (Awful) Cry seized those who did injustice, and morning found them prostrate in their dwellings,  [11:95] As though they had not dwelt there. A far removal for Midian, even as Thamud had been removed afar!  [11:96] And verily We sent Moses with Our revelations and a clear warrant  [11:97] Unto Pharaoh and his chiefs, but they did follow the command of Pharaoh, and the command of Pharaoh was no right guide.  [11:98] He will go before his people on the Day of Resurrection and will lead them to the Fire for watering-place. Ah, hapless is the watering- place (whither they are) led.  [11:99] A curse is made to follow them in the world and on the Day of Resurrection. Hapless is the gift (that will be) given (them).  [ 11:100] That is (something) of the tidings of the townships (which were destroyed of old). We relate it unto thee (Muhammad). Some of them are standing and some (already) reaped.  [11:101] We wronged them not, but they did wrong themselves; and their gods on whom they call beside Allah availed them naught when came thy Lord’s command; they added to them naught save ruin.  [11:102] Even thus is the grasp of thy Lord when He graspeth the townships while they are doing wrong. Lo! His grasp is painful, very strong.  [11:103] Lo! herein verily there is a portent for those who fear the doom of the Hereafter. That is a day unto which mankind will be gathered, and that is a day that will be witnessed.  [11:104] And We defer it only to a term already reckoned.  [11:105] On the day when it cometh no soul will speak except by His permission; some among them will be wretched, (others) glad.  [11:106] As for those who will be wretched (on that day) they will be in the Fire; sighing and wailing will be their portion therein,  [11:107] Abiding there so long as the heavens and the earth endure save for that which thy Lord willeth. Lo! thy Lord is Doer of what He will.  [11:108] And as for those who will be glad (that day) they will be in the Garden, abiding there so long as the heavens and the earth endure save for that which thy Lord willeth: a gift unfailing.  [11:109] So be not thou in doubt concerning that which these (folk) worship. They worship only as their fathers worshipped aforetime. Lo! we shall pay them their whole due unabated.  [11:110] And we verily gave unto Moses the Scripture, and there was strife thereupon; and had it not been for a Word that had already gone forth from thy Lord, the case would have been judged between them, and lo! they are in grave doubt concerning it.  [11:111] And lo! unto each thy Lord will verily repay his works in full. Lo! He is Informed of what they do.  [11:112] So tread thou the straight path as thou art commanded, and those who turn (unto Allah) with thee, and transgress not. Lo! He is Seer of what ye do.  [11:113] And incline not toward those who do wrong lest the Fire touch you, and ye have no protecting friends against Allah, and afterward ye would not be helped.  [11:114] Establish worship at the two ends of the day and in some watches of the night. Lo! good deeds annul ill-deeds. This is reminder for the mindful.  [11:115] And have patience, (O Muhammad), for lo! Allah loseth not the wages of the good.  [11:116] If only there had been among the generations before you men possessing a remnant (of good sense) to warn (their people) from corruption in the earth, as did a few of those whom We saved from them! The wrong-doers followed that by which they were made sapless, and were guilty.  [11:117] In truth thy Lord destroyed not the townships tyrannously while their folk were doing right.  [11:118] And if thy Lord had willed, He verily would have made mankind one nation, yet they cease not differing,  [11:119] Save him on whom thy Lord hath mercy; and for that He did create them. And the Word of thy Lord hath been fulfilled: Verily I shall fill hell with the jinn and mankind together.  [11:120] And all that We relate unto thee of the story of the messengers is in order that thereby We may make firm thy heart. And herein hath come unto thee the Truth and an exhortation and a reminder for believers.  [11:121] And say unto those who believe not: Act according to your power. Lo! We (too) are acting.  [11:122] And wait! Lo! We (too) are waiting.  [11:123] And Allah’s is the Invisible of the heavens and the earth, and unto Him the whole matter will be returned. So worship Him and put thy trust in Him. Lo! thy Lord is not unaware of what ye (mortals) do.
Russian government started the invasion of Oekrain on compietely false and insane accusations. This invasion degenerated into a total war with destruction of cities and targeting of civilians everywhere. Russian government must be condemned of causing war crimes on a large scale.a peace agreement is only acceptable with full withdrawal of the army of russia and total compensation for all the destruction.
But America doesn’t want to stop they making billions in arms
As a cloud of thick smoke hangs over the occupied city of Kherson, its’ very stench is evidence of Russian war crimes on a massive scale. The smoke comes from Russian mobile incinerators that are running night and day. Putin’s paranoid soldiers are burning the corpses of Ukrainian citizens tortured and murdered on suspicion of helping the resistance. And they are dispatching the bodies of their own comrades too, Russians killed by the constant pounding of Ukrainian shells and by highly organized secret units of freedom fighters. They are even killed by gangs of youths armed with knives who set upon drunken Russians and stab them. Many of the Russian troops are drunk all the time, arms ammunition, kit and even food are in short supply for Putin’s blundering army, but Vodka is available in abundance. These soldiers are rounded up from the poorest regions of Putin’s empire, far away from St Petersburg and Moscow. No one in the main cities wants to have their sons sent to be butchered in occupied territories. Instead, bribes are often offered in rural districts, where conditions are little different from the world of Tolstoy’s peasants. Many people are illiterate and generally ignorant of international news. They live largely without sanitation in poverty and disease. This information is reliable and comes from Kherson residents strongly opposed to Russian  occupation, who are risking everything to reveal the truth.
Ukraine should take back there whole country including crimera
He must finish wat he started or we will end it for him. We havent even Started yet
He will get back more than what he did to those poor people
according to the comments, one demand is that ukraine cannot join the EU. but ukraine is part of europe. terrorizing ukraine doesnt make them any less a part of europe.  putin is crazy, we're gonna have to stop him like hitler was stopped in 1944. Hes turned russia into nazi russia
If you stop resisting I will stop killing your children and raping your girls/women, bombing your cities, stealing your crops, stealing your washing machines and dryers, says the bully.  Sounds like demands few people in Ukraine will give in to, IMHO.
Peace on earth
Good, grant my demand
Dictators are just that   in the end they end up in prison
Putin is the greatest leader in the last 200 years...... in the world.
They should stop fighting in their own country. Why not withdrawal of your troops instead. Did Ukraine fight Russia in their country? That's the childish condition so far.
Putin is a lier, don't trust this shit
He destroy all of Ukraine, then tell people what he wants. Evil KanEvil
Don’t ever trust Putin. He only knows how to lie
No keep killing the orcs
@news_hue:Human Rights Violations are being committed by Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada. Melville has been to be corrupt with all police officers. were able to harass and belittle me for 2 months and are trying to set me up, Mr President Putin please accept me into Russia as Canada has Violated my human rights. I am serious I would relieve myself of Canadian citizenship to be safe from family who are abusive and are always getting a slap on the hand for crimes
he needs to get out of other people's home....is this guy sick of the head? how can Ukraine stop fighting when you are at the home you F$%&
There where not much refugees in world war 2 because more then 6 million where killed
Putin Soldiers no match to ukrainian Army.
Invaders and murderers don't get to make demands. Especially a bully like Putin. He can make his demands during his war crimes trial so the whole world can get to laugh at him.
what is the difference between Moscow and Russia? I am getting confused now
Gotta pull out so he can go to war with America and help china
Always with the loveable leader Mr. Putin with lot of true love  straight from my heart :-)
Condition 1. Try him as a war criminal Condition 2.  Russia must pay reparations. C9ndition 3. Putin goes to gulag for betraying the improvements to a sovereign humanity.
So total and unconditional surrender - so dumb. Why should Ukraine stop fighting? Peace? Subjugation and Demilitarization? Extermination as the Ukrainian’s were under Russian occupation decades ago? People don’t forget things like that. And would rather die fighting then live a long life as a second class person or a slave.
Selfish demands
What condition? Air condition or hair condition??😬
As Russia's last war Vladimir Putin wants Ukraine to lay down its arms . Russia wants a cease fire they should just pack up and leave the country . If Ukraine stops the Russians will just continue fighting and claiming more territory Russia needs to keep fighting because when the fighting ends, win or lose Mr. Putin is a dead man
Zellensky tell him to stick his conditions where the sun dont shine.......... Putin is sounding desperate
Z
No peace with Ukranian nazis, please😎 The Ukranian capitulation is only a subject to discuss😅
Bla bla bla, this is all the West fault aka Nato and United Snakes 🐍
If the condiciones aren't  meet ...go ahead RUSSIA keep crashing the proxy faulty state....
And something elste to this point the its not the proxy faulty state to stand up its the NATO the branched Arm of. USA and RUSIA.....
And algo the lost territory from the  proxy faulty state is out of negotiation......the sovereignity had been broken sinse 2014.......
Just  USA is the only protagonist  if to meet the condiciones that RUSSIA wants to ..if ii doesn't want to....the War and grabbing more territory from the PROXY faulty state its going to scalate up..and more desaster..... .
Just realize that..wion presenters are HOAX.
When did ukrane start fighting?
Yea  what  Putin  want  he is  not  going to  get  Remember  wanted  dead or alive for war crimes against humanity Says IAM who Iam Amen and amen
Ukraine to lay down their Arms. They never raised the in the first place. More like Russia lay down your Arms and go back where you came from.
No talks unless Russia moves out of Ukraine. Period!.
The west complicity in the war is totally unacceptable  as more deaths rises
Its depends what is the demands... If the russia demands want ukraine to be part of russia or surrender to russia without blood then ukrainians a fool...too much bloods are filled, but in the end surrender.. if ur fighting for your country then surrender or die..
crap news   what aer the requirements  ??? u think we are idiots ?
Starting not to trust WION
This war would never be happening if these people knew how to respect human dignity. To show them what its like to lose dignity they should be starved in Israel for a week and dropped pork for aid, and they can only get some pork if they declare that Jesus is the messiah after they kiss a crucifix.
Yes, Okay..., So..., Putin (aka Russia) will cease all military actions and end the war "Only" if Ukraine gives in to all Russia's demands and stops fighting back. Effectively, Russia will stop  only if the people of Ukraine gives their country over to Russia without any penalty to Russia for the invasion, with the people it has killed, and lives it has destroyed, the cities it has demolished. Sure, this sounds like an amicable way to end the war. What a great deal Putin. You are a master negotiator - NOT!
End Putin
Yeah and its bullshit..how can Russia's invasion create the greatest refugee crisis since WW2. What happened to the refugee crisis since the invasion of Iraq...Libya..Afghanistan..Syria..to name a few since WW2....🤨
Putana putana putana..
So, the condition is losing the east part of Ukrain
bossman
Thank👍💯💯💯 God 🙏💯🖤❤️🦋🦋🦋🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲👋✊
The attacker gets to make demands it’s like I rob a store and make demands 😂
Eastern Ukraine is now Russia or no ceasefire. Thats what i think.
Ceasefire for redrawn borders of Ukraine respected by NATO.
Well what the hell are the demands
I learned nothing at all.
Oh
Listen people there's a place people like him are going to go to that are so scary and so full of torture it happens forever and ever and it's a sad sick place and you die there every day and you come back it's called torture pain hell.  See when you're in hell you get chased and scream and cry you feel pain and then you die and then you come back and you do it all over again everyday it's the same thing and it's torture and it's called hell.  I was sent here to describe things to you so maybe you could understand.  Jesus did die for our sins and he was sent down here to understand more about the evil that everybody is dealt with every day.  What he has done to humans is sick any man that tortures or kills anyone and saddens anyone else's heart has a place in hell.
blah blah blah incomplete information
What do you do when you can't trust someone?
Empty and time-wasting.
THANK YOU MR.PUTIN OF ENDING INVASION IN UKRAINE.
Condition “Ukraine first stops fighting” ie NATO stops supplying troops and weapons to Ukraine.  As much as I feel it’s overreach by any country to dictate anything to another, this war must end under any conditions. Better to be alive than to continue to fight to either be under Russia or USA.
PUTIN made a new war crime law on industries. Watch it on YouTube. That DICTATOR will cut open the Russian people back and pack salt inside. Full IRON FIST...
Putin the war criminal only tells lies  Putin is the most hated human being  in the world.
9
Hahaha. Ruzzia is lozing. Hahaha
This is written in the bible,whether you like it or not this will end in a nuclear war. I'm telling you this people to prepare yourselves...don't get your hopes up. It's time to go back to your creater and ask for forgiveness coz the world is about to end. When GOD said I will end the world with fire he meant this.
an period of 2252 yrs caiche .
The real winner of it all AND  the human who initiates the  6th postatlantean epoqu 😀
MOSCOW IS NOT IN A POSITION TO GIVE DEMANDS TO UKRAINE. MOSCOW WOULD HAVE TO REBUILT UKRAINE, LEAST THEY ALL  WILL DIE IN RUSSIA.
Don't trust Putin , he is snake like Stalin
Putin always lies....
Russian Putin his the attacker of a country and demand to stop to fichting.  Its a real joke from him .He most widrow from Ucraienna and very fast .
Russia will end the conflict if Ukraine stop fighting so they can easily go in and take it all over bulshit Putin
Why should Ukrain give russia anything, after putin murdering thousands of its citizens  and destroying their cities. Thats mad and crazy isn't it? So sorry for innocent children who were brutally killed.
V
What are the demands???????
What are the demands?
Hey, Putin take a number.
Ukraine needs to tell Turkey to stay out of it.
What are the demands🤔🤔🤔
The condition is to leave Ukraine territories.
This is a sign of weakness
That was paint drying at its best
Is this approved by your boss, Klaus Schwab, comrad Vladimir.
Seems far fetchd..  Think abt it!
This is not abt russia - it is abt Terraforming Earth -  eliminate humans and concur earth.  Why only now did they disclosed aliens?  Think aby it.
😂😂😂🇯🇵🇺🇸🇫🇰🇨🇳🇨🇦🇭🇲🇹🇼
It's good that d war is ended all peoples in worlds will very very happy n peoples in worlds will salute you Putin
Ain’t going to happen is it.
Russia threatened Ukraine.  Eventually attacked it.   Russia threatens Lithuania.   Russia threatens Sweden.   Should they ignore the threats?
The talks of ceasefire and diplomacy are signs that Vladimir Putin is beginning to buckle under punitive western sanctions and increasingly aggressive western military support to Ukraine. Vladimir Putin has to stop the war and withdraw from Ukraine unconditionally before any discussion about his grievances and security guarantees for both Ukraine and Russia.
The stupid rich want to get of it. The planet, we humans can't
Should he not study the planet more than war?
What kind of report is this? There is nothing!!!
What are his conditions????
So,what are the conditions? Poor reporting.
I'm surprised that Putin did not demand the removal oif Nazis from Ukraine.
Who can trust what a liar says?
Russia will not be giving back most of what they captured ..
How does anyone still say Russia is in the wrong in Ukraine? The truth is easily available for anyone who wants to know.
You can take Putin's demands and shove them up Lavrov's ass.
Nato should just stand down and stop trying to get everyone on earth killed for the sake off a million people the United States kills people all the time but no one says nothing about them lol
No condition Russians  go back to your country and stop this occupational war live in peace in your own country
My father just died tonight, I've buried 2 children, they were not murdered, one day Mr President will feel our pain
The war is really not about Ukraine. It is about Putin and his illegitimate regime. Putin must be removed. If sanctions are lifted and the war ends, Putin will continue to send spies everywhere. He is a threat to democracy and must be neutralized.
I SORRY FOR THOSE WHO EXCEPT JUSTICE FROM AMERICA FOR CRIMES COMMITTED BY ISRAEL..  PIETY
Crazy world, now a thief has guts to dictate conditions.
He is not giving that privilege to do what he thinks is Justified
He started the war now he's got to end it in our terms
Don't you dare give it that's more cow manure than cows are in Ukraine that's just a slap in the face who needs to get out of office for us to stop the war on him and put somebody else in charge over there a civilian
Is it possible that this fighting was meant to start a third world war I order for the NWO to impliment it's agenda so that can control the while world? I don't think nations would readily give it up, for the reason they will stay as slaves to this situation for the rest of their natural lives!
Putin is there best
So be it, and face trials to accountable the damages.
Putin is only talking about a cease-fire because he cannot make significant advances, he is gradually losing control, his forces are suffering increasing losses, he is running out of troops willing to fight, he will run out of ammunition, he will not be able to get supplies to the front as weapons for Ukraine from the West build up and time is running out for him. He can only hold on to what he has now if there is a cease-fire in which Ukraine accepts the "status-quo".
Praise God for this,happy to heard this news! To God be all the Glory!!!
There is no peace with a godless country.
🇺🇸🤝🇺🇦💪🏻💪🏻it’s impossible to trust Putin at this point.
Nagyon  észnél  van  Putin  meg  ha  áldozat  árán  is  a  nyugati  nagy  országokhoz  képest  akiknek  elment  a  józan  eszük  akiknek  más  orszáhok  embereik  vegzik  el  a   munkát  hejettük   GYALÁZAT  HOGY  CSAK  A  KIZSÁKMÁNYOLÁSHOZ  ÉRTENEK!!
Why should he be the one to set condition(s)? I would like to read Ukraine's condition(s) to end the war.
Nonsense Why is he sending drones to Ukraine ?
President Putin, smartest leader on the planet! I salute you Sir! My ancestor was on convoys taking supplies to help you fight the fascists. He liked the Russian people. You are still fighting warmongering fascists. Good luck!
You are not in a position ....you will comply to Ukrainians demands.....or die by the sword
This leader has a very vey annoying voice.
Whenever the war mongers are in power, bullets and missiles start to rain like water, the same way they are now pushing for another destruction of EU and Russian, and EU cannot read between lines and say no to that.
I pray for the 14000  Russian lives lost in Donbas since 2014
Peace is better we really appreciated mr. Putin
This is hyper deceiving how to believe Moscow's communist tyranny they abruptly attack despite their denials in the build up of troops and weapons at the Ukraine borders... What if Kiev gives in and stops fighting thereafter Moscow ceases their weapons and run over suddenly overwhelmingly overtake cease Ukraine...
Your joking only Bilken and the foreign policy cabal in washington can stop the war in Ukraine, not even Biden can negotiate for an End
It's not over, Putin will never agree to help Ukraine rebuild. He will continue to badger his neighbor's. He's still crazy mean and irresponsible, he will continue threats and probably when he regroups, he will go off the deep end, attack the weak countries, intimidate others suck-up to China, Iran, South America and Cuba. Threaten Europe, Canada, United States, + others. Putin is hungry to see how his nukes will respond.
If putin rules Ukraine he will send the Ukrainians to Siberia and move his people in to run Ukraine...not a pleasant future.
HE IS NOT IN A POSITION TO DO SO....IT WILL BE UKRAINE THAT WILL DETERMINE ANYTHING....NOT MURDERERS ...THEIVES AND RAPISTS...
Is  it  OK  to  invade  a  country  and  then  make  demands  as  a  solution  to  peace  would  Putin  want America  to  invade  Russia  and  then  make  demands  as  a  perequiste  to  peace  I  was  always  taught  to  do  unto  others  as  you  will  have  them  do  unto  you  nuff  said
za Polish się brać  Wybić w pokoleniu cały  rządy . I to  bez wyjątku.
Oh yeah and what are Moscows conditions?
What are the demands?
This was a waste of my time 🤣
One of em needs to be that he'll step down and withdraw, then I can see a deal ,oh and we won't hold him for war crimes as long as he STAYS within his  USSR.
Very enlightening. In depth investigative reporting usually has some details. Hell, any details would be good. Try harder please.
When you threaten to destroy the entire world you better call your own undertaker
Russia will invade Turkey next.
So basically same shit different day!! Same demands not good!!
Rosja ma mi dostarczyć jedzenie na proces w USA UK
yes their demands are just too much
The art of negotiation where one party  proposes to secure better terms to an adversary that appears to be winning, is to exercise the right of pre-emption, to make it appear , in the eyes of the world, had the position of strength. This may likely in the mind of Russias Vladimir Putin. The argument is that why is Goliath with it's enormous strength and military might will negotiate to a lesser opponent, if he thinks he is winning the war. It's premature gesture, and can be construed negatively in favor of the Biblical David - Ukraine, in the ongoing fight.
What kind of news is this?  What demands are met?  Garbage!!!!!! NEWS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Dear Mr. Putin, I am writing to inform you that last week when I was transferring devices, I failed to tell you that the CIA locked me out of my two Gmail accounts at the libraries. Most Sincerely ❣️, Gayle Raye Bremer
3 major definition of War  1.War is a racket 2. War is profit  3. War beget War
huwag kayong maniwala ky putin dahil sugo sya n satanas
Putin’s signature isn’t worth anything!
As usual Putin is always well meaning and offers very just conditions to end fighting . Free world must back  Putin . Indian Military Veterans .
So what are Poootin’s 💩💩💩 Demands ???
As in past Mr. PUTIN HAS KEPT PAST PROMISES and said if Ukraine stops fighting excuse me but who invaded who first  Ukraine  was a neutral peacefully Country until Mr Puntin took the first  steps to Dominate  Ukrain.
🏴😘🇷🇺🇹🇷😘🏴
I wouldn't trust Putin. He is like Hitler.
The     russian,s     have    proved    to    lie    to    the    west   on    many    occation,s,   in    the    past   &     present    time,s.,   president    putin    can     never    be   trusted,    The     west    must    be   prepared,     to    put    putin    on    trial    for    war    crime,s,    againest     ukraine.
That war will stop if putin withdraw all his forces out from Ukraine. The war begun because putin attacks Ukraine. If he really wants to stop the war, he should pull out all his troops out, and pay the damages he incurred in Ukraine. ✌️✌️✌️✌️👌👌👌👌
Putins "agreements" are meaningless. He has not kept any of them.
Conditions of a badger
He’s in a tight spot I wouldn’t do it.
WTF !? If Ukraine stops fighting? Fascist Putin needs to stop ..
Hbcu
NO WAY! RUSSIA SHOULD BE PUNISH.
Moscows demand are very clear. All east provinces and south completely to belong to Russia
where are the demands in the video?
last time I watched your video you said Putin has probably died and disappeared or is a body double. Come on wion you can do better
YOU WILL LEAVE UKRANE SOIL AND WILL NOT amend TO ANY OF YOUR SO CALLED CONDITIONS....THEY  WILL KEEP BOMBING THE SHIT OUT OF YOUR  STOLEN OIL AND THEY WILL HIT MANY MORE TIMES....ON ALL OIL REFINERIES...NOW RETURNING THE FAVOUR TO YOU TENFOLD....GLORY TO UKRAINE 🇺🇦
R I P Putin
Putin Has lied many times in past. AS he is right now.  Plus  his demands are far ferched. LOL telling Ukraine has to stop fighting first yeah okay so he can destroy them b*******
THIS SAID NOTHING!
This man is pure evil. He must be stopped. How can one person in today’s world be able to destroy so much and so many? China and India both supporting him by buying oil and gas pure greed. President Trump warned Western Europe on buying Russian oil and gas and getting dependent on it. They never listened. Merkel what a fool!!!
now presedent putin want to talk on the table to peomote peace... the world is hoping that the clowns ( us, uk/nato and zelensky would not lough at him...
Interesting that Turkey is comfortable to have talks with a Nuclear Terrorist.
How rich!  They start the war then set conditions for ending it.
Putin your not getting shit…. Your demands.. .. is that a joke! Ukraine is destroying your entire military.. there air force is dominating you now.. here’s a demand you leave right now that’s all your gonna get
I’m from america and I stand with russia.. ukraine should have stayed away from nato i support russias decision to invade
Watch Putting doing and it will give you a clue to what BIDEN is really up to.
The Turkish president is the only president in NATO...The rest are stooges...more of vampires...always, baying for blood...
Invaded Ukraine, now listen to Russia… hmmm… shit don’t add up…🤔🤔🤔
Putin lost his mind. his condition is only for himself. He has no right to demand. Putin must Remind himself of his obligation to UN and international law.
How can anyone comprehend these statements coming from this child killer Putin. He is making demands he has no justification to make any demands to Ukraine. He and his abomination  invades invaded Ukraine. He and his house of cards the Kremlin agreed to start this war. It's The Ukrainein's that have the right to lay down Demands to Putin and to take your abomination invades out from our Country of Ukraine . It's time that the free World started to voice out that this war criminal must be brought to justice  for the genocide  against the Ukrainen People and for the Destination of their Country.  He has no right to be in Ukraine this so called Special Operation is his personal War against humanity of the Ukrainen People nothing need to be said.
WHAT ABOUT UKRAINIENS AND NATO CONDITIONS ? I THINK PUTIN  NEEDS TO RECOVER HIS STRATEGY AND LOST IN ORDER TO ATTACK LATER OTHER COUNTRY ? RESTORE THE BORDERS OF UKRAINE AND PAY REPAPATION FOR ALL DAMAGE WHAT YOU HAVE DONE TO UKRAINE ? EVIL PEOPLE DON'T HAVE PEACE , BECAUSE THEY ARE POSSESS BY EVIL SPIRITS ? THEIR JOY IS ? - ONLY WHEN THEY HURT SOMEONE ?
The world has birth pains for sure, the suffering is immense, the children in this generation surely cannot have it easy, all the hunger and poverties in the world, Polio practically starved out, now is showing its face in Britain. And vaccines are under the spotlight and distrust among many, what about monkey pox together with this terrible covid, the more China resists coming out with information about  an honest opinion how this terrible virus brooded out, we won't know how to combat it. The war Russia started should be seen much broader that the Russians themselves. It has to do with the human race and creation. Now is the time. Jesus calling on every thirsty man, come to me all who labor. come to me all who are thirsty, and i will give you Rest. We cannot deny in this world of suffering, we need God more than ever
Ukraine demands its whole country back from the Orks, so no deal.
After Hee screws everybodys overs=pressured wants ended this insanes war.ruined economys of world,t,on pins ,t needelings
Never negotiate with a TERRORIST. End of. ELIMINATE EVIL AND PUTIN.

Ukraine never surrender to Russian Putin demands fight for life from a bully. Russia can't take it west Europa us not buying Russia. Gas.  Isreal will help Europe they have big reserves.  Isreal the energy superpower of Europe
hahaha!!!! This is laughable, why don’t you broke into my home and tell me not to fuckin blow your head off and also to hand over  everything and watch you walk off.. what a crock of shit, I say Ukraine should keep fighting because Putin smells the end of his reign, the end is near and Putin knows it’s game over if he tries anything different than conventional warfare... he will be blown to pieces. I don’t understand why the Russians keep voting this imbecile into power.. smh
Pasta Putineska That's French for Very Few Ingredients
There should be no such demand coming from Russia towards Ukraine Russia start  the war not Ukraine
Could the world knows what is Russia demanding from Ukraine
Could the world knows what is Russia demanding from Ukraine
Ukrainian citizens and army please don't trust  please keep open eyes towards any alarm
Make he bleed out
Who is fighting putin or the people he sends to.fight
Yes Pootin , We the world except your SURRENDER!
🥱
In other words he will stop if they surrender unconditionally !
Phase 1 went as planned: fall of the Soviet Union. Phase 2 is on the way: fall of the Russian Federation. Phase 3: the counties in the ex-Russian Federation will be independent and Russia will shrink.         SLAVA ✊🇺🇦 UKRAINI
God bless you President Putin.
They all need our prayers
He,s trying to stop his  treaty side from committing chemical terrorism against our treaty with him of our American constitution.
The sad battlefield reports may have convinced Russia to seek negotiation. Slava Ukraine.
The war in Ukraine  must cease  by all means this war is having a domino effect  on all countries.  PUTIN  remember  God will judge you  here and the here after so at this point make peace  here to lessen the blow here after.
Ignore the little horror, that is the one thing he dreads.
Putin looked like he was ready to do knuckles 🤣
🇺🇦 UKRAINE DONT ACCEPT ANY CONDITION FR 🇷🇺 PUTIN  🇷🇺 BLOODIMIR IS ALMOST DEATH COW
Putin has died already.
Ukraine should destroy all the 46 dangerous labs creating diseases, Chemical Weapons, Biological Weapons,. To stop all human trafficking, child sex trafficking, money laundering...etc..etc..etc
Stop the war. Don't make Europe into  another Middle East.
Unconditional cease to war
Russia make sure you prepare for a major war please Russia 🇷🇺 take care of United States this time United States is creating big trouble for the world
Putin  go fine him mother and put her in  sexual position no son should have there mom ,germs.
Putin..is making...the..money. On oil!!!
When you are winning on the ground, you get to set the terms. I guess the refugee crisis the western invasion of Libya, Afghanistan, Iraq and their interference leading to and contributing to the Arab spring and the war in Syria are meant to be brushed under the carpet?
he’s winning big time watch him get everything he wants  Putin     2 Obama 0
Putins a idiot fancy building a country next to all those nato military bases.
Kick turkey out of NATO.....
They always forget about what they did to Belgrade.
More lies. More false benefits.
People dying for nothing. A fools war.
We'll stop invading you if you stop beating us up.
So UKRAINE CHANGE ITS NAZI PATCH TO ANOTHER STYLE PATCH. WHY IS AMERICA AND OTHERS BACKING A NAZI NATION/ REGIME?  Putin is Russian, he is not a NAZI, are we in the WORLD TO CONDEM NAZISMS OR ARE WE TO CONDONE AND SUPPORT A HITLER NAZI STATE/ GOVERNMENT??????
There will be no conditions just get out of Ukraine and face all the consequences of your madness at the Hague. Justice must prevail against Putin .
1. Thessalonians 5:3 can't hardly wait
West always wants war so that keep selling their weapons. Don't stop war already spent lot of money west must surrender to russia no mediation business. Keep on beating until say uncle. United east we are together. Mr russia make it ussr not remain russia like naya bharath no more india jai hind jai bharathp
Ukraine should at least consider opening talks with Moscow. though I fear the demands will be rejected as the conditions will be in Putins interests which means annexation ps if so what happens to all the war crimes "
Pilnuj Karolci i Any Marcina.
W UK pochowani jak te szczury.
How about these conditions " you go home and shut your mouth "
Putin only wants to steal more ukrainian lands.
Putin must be high
I ve always feared visiting any communist country because of hate for Americans.  It's good people can visit but me I still have fears.  It's liking walking on eggshells
Thank GOD Putin ends invasion.  As an American I pray this happens.
No conditions.... Oh, there is one: Putin to die. In pain.
Turkey to do peacetalks? How hypocritical is that? They are still attacking their neighbors and seem not to shy from invasion.
Don't worry  .... His demands weren't met....  And he is still at war

Putin does not have any grounds to make demands. Ukraine needs to go into Russia and finish what they started.
Russia has lost the WAR, also lost face in the eyes of the World,  now trying to save his ASS.
This man should be put in prison for life.
Russia is wrong. This war will only end when they surrender and retreat. Ukraine will never fall.
Load of s..t
The only way to stop Putin is to flood the Russian people with the truth as told individually by each individual and each country. Flood every media point and add more access points the Russians can connect to. If the Russian people know the truth, they will unite to stop Putin before he creates a nuclear holocaust. Every computer hacker, Every communications company, Every university and Every government can help with this process. The Russian people will end this war when they find out they have been lied to about everything.
Let's talk about Russian reparations to Ukraine for all the unprovoked damage and carnage they have caused.
NATO are $hit disturbers!
Just leave Ukraine to feel their sovereignty without your involvement, just let them be, stop the killing.
He started it, he's losing and now he wants to set conditions to stop or else what, kill more civilians? he wants Ukraine to stop wiggling so he can cut its head off?
😜😜😜😜😂😂😂
Uraaaa Russia
Ukraine is defeating Russia and will eventually take back all territory including Crimea. Erdogan should keep his stupid mouth shut and if Turkey attempts to stop Finland joining NATO Turkey should be kicked out of NATO.
War could've been avoided but the other chose to be a puppet, what a clown. This is in favor of the West.
I like this lady. Very informative and with some humor..
Fight ur own to get godsblessing🧐
Ukraine is a sovereign nation. If they want to join NATO they can join. Fak putin

This video said nothing. Merely repeated the same empty non-informative statement three times.
Putin only. Cares about Power, Money, Greed. He steals and kills to get what he wants. Uses people like meat.
Lets bring back Russia to the rest of the world   they are good people and good friends.   West just dont hate Russia peace around  world  we need Russian people !!
why is everyone confused. i get Putins demands. What he is saying is Ukraine stop fighting, let us take over your country, and we wont attack you any more. But that doesnt make any sence, as the fighting is over Russia trying to take Ukraine in the first place. 🤔🤨
Bb b.  H b h h h
I told that fool long time ago stop fighting u can't beet Putin he is the world boss now look how much life u let Putin killl
Mr. Putin. Show the world that you are not the monster they want to portray of you. PLEASEEEEE.! HELP PAKISTAN. HELP TO IMRAN KHAN.
After they stole America money...billions ....stolen....
Moldova is next Putin wants no peace  he wants the soviet union back together by force
Prayers for you mr Putin, I don’t fully understand why you started this war but for some reason I trust you Volodimer
PUTAYN IS A PREDATOR OF CONFLICT.  HE IS CRAZY
He can no longer hide the fact that he’s a Tyrant, A Bully and a War criminal!!!!! SLAVA UKRAINI!!!!!🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦
If ukraine did not grab this peace talk citezen of ukraine will more more suffer,thanks for peace decision
Purins conditions are not acceptable 🙏🏼
Why not finish what you have started, if you can? Your adversaries are now beginning to make a better stand. Is your conscience bothered by the souls of the innocent thousands killed by your bombs and missiles? Now is yours. Tomorrow you pay. Life is like a bubble that vanishes into thin air. No one last forever on this earth.
Putin is the one invade it's neighborhood, now he is the one set condition. what do people think? he must be crazy! He will jus received Divine Retribution for his war crime and he must  thrown into the lake of fire  and live with Satan in peace.
This is the vaguest news click bait I have ever seen.  By stop fighting, he means stop shooting down incoming missiles and counter shelling the positions that are firing at you?  I assume a full pull out to at least the Feb 23 lines.
Bless you all. Stop fighting
Putin condition role over assume the position bite the pillow an get raped by Russia
Putin talks shit to the UN secretary General, while civilians are bombed in the streets of Ukraine. India has to stop supporting Putins genocide.
Everybody knows your days are numbered Mr Putin. Why bother us with these theatrics?
Thank you Mr, President
Very good end of war and Peace ✌️
It didn't meet he's demand that's why still no ceasefire aggrement bein held
Haha wtf
This is my first day watching Wion. This title is obviously misleading. Credibility lost. I'm moving on.
Putin, we have the perfect casket for you, and that is, a Russian tank modified by Ukraine.
We have to endure the war to end the war.
Mr Turkey EU/USA  don't like your mediation because you are a Muslim and their main objective is to FINISH ISLAM  .... ALLAH 's  chosen religion.
Waht! Putin will stop the invasion if Ukraine stop fighting!!! His Parkinson is getting worse
Finland must learn lessons From this Ukrain war for joining NATO'S ?. STAND ON Your LEGS DON'T Trust NATO  countries
Because,   he  knows  that  he's   losing.He. shouldn't   sat  no  condition,,,,  he  started  the  war,  now  it's  up to   Ukraine   to  set  the  rules,,,  Don't   give  in,,,just  think  of  all  the  lives  that  were  lost  .  For  what  honor   their  memories,,,,, Don't   give  in
Putin is showing power.. It is not justice ... He killed many more Ukrainy... He made Ukrain dead place..
I hope or we hope  that the conflict will be finished ASAP as our economy is in very very low from the time of pandemic untill now
Putin trying to fist bump erdogan 🤜 🤛
Don’t accept anything, rather get bombed by Satan rockets
I watch more WION than American news, and I'm an American. I think that shows a lot. Keep going guys!
Pres. Vladimir Putin, the Catholic cognitively impaired Pres. Joe Biden functions only with the help of Dopamine; in other words doped up, and since Pres. Biden has marshaled against you and Russia the United States military, Great Britain and the Commonwealth countries, even Germany's Chancellor, the country that caused the death of six million Jews when the Jewish Hitler who hated Jews because his father raped his Austrian Catholic mother Klara and abandoned him as a child, and also former prime minister Netanyahu who was born Assyrian Church of the East and Pentecostal later, he also is fighting Russia, and Israel' Prime Minister Naftali Bennell also is against Russia, and Japan's Kishida the thief who stole my $2 billion dollars is also your enemy, Pres. Vladimir Putin and the enemy of Russia, when in WW II he was on the side of Hitler's Germany, and also the African American President Barack Hussein Obama as a Sunni Muslim he hates Communism which is a rejection of Allah, and all the African countries are against you, Pres. Vladimir Putin and Russia -- I would suggest that you seek a peaceful solution with President Zelinskyy who is Jewish, and that will make all the Jews in Israel and in the US, especially the billionaires and the millionaires happy -- it should be clear, President Vladimir Putin that a peaceful solution with one man, Pres. Zelinskyy would be the best thing you can do. I know it's hard, but then why would you want to have more Russians and Ukrainians die, since both countries are Orthodox Christians -- Victor Nimrud Alexander, a Roman Catholic and now a friend of Pope Francis.
Ukrains demands for Peace after an unprovoked Invasion by Putin's Military, All Russian Military and soldiers must be Removed from Ukrain,  All Russian frozen assets, ships, bank accounts etc be used to rebuild Ukrain, Putin's Russia pays to rebuild Ukrain buildings and infrastructure,  Russia pay for Ukrains loss of GDP over the next several years, Russia pays reparations to families for lost/death and disabled Ukrainians, Putin's Russia pays for the continued medical treatment including therapy Ukrainians will need due to Putin's Russia invasion of the Peaceful country of Ukrain
Only 1 condition to be met Putin goes too JAIL thats it
👿👿👿Evil Putin goes to heel soon 👿👿👿I never say good words to a Satan .
Crazy Putin..who invade Ukrain first? Ukrainians are not stupid ...After you inflict a thousand  dead civilians and destroyed their cities.
Don't bother asking how NATO lulled Ukraine into this fiasco knowing how Russia would react to NATO membership offer. Just point to Russia being unreasonable.
Joe Biden and our generals knew weeks ago that the next Russian push would be  Mariupol. Where are the weapons, tanks, field guns that were promised. The only way  to stop Putin now is the army, marines and US war materiel manned by the USA. It will be to the shame of the US and its allies if Putin manages to blackmail the world and the world dictator he wants to be. I promise you the war will stop the moment Putin realizes that he cannot conquer the entire western forces. His nuclear threat is a paper threat. His army is shit. That's because his jurisdiction over Russia is shit. and enforced only by police power and threats, murder of the opposition. Putin is a bully and a coward. Look at his swagger. He does not even have any military sense.
Bloody USA  created more refugees in the world more than Rus
Very easy to stop war. Russian army must stop going to territories of Ukraine. please  president Putin   , pray to almighty God.
USA would not like this news.
No ' you have known that '
I thought that they were ALL DEAD .
And she's beautiful 😍 like Elizabeth Taylor Beautiful. WITH HEIRS . PUT WRONG RIGHT MR PUTIN. ✅
Your Queen is with UKRAINE 🇺🇦 ✨ 😍 💕 💖
But Ukraine doesn't exist. Their leaders are puppets to international Zionist cartel that control 🇺🇸 and Europe.  The war brings profits to them so .....
Does it not ' stun you ' 🤔  ? Mr Putin.
You could ' return your Queen ' 👸 ✨ 💖 ordained by God.
Of Course, the Ukranean people  will not welcome it becayse no country would like to accept that other country woukd just come. &  invade their  country, do devastation & massacre people  country  fir greed & personal ambition
If he thinks euro citizens are going to back their governments policy of golden bridge back to geopolitics. He's wrong. And any politician that backs such a move is a Hypocritic and communist, and should be forced to resign when they do.
Молитвы всего мира с храбрым и гордым народом Украины, защищающим свою страну от неспровоцированного и неоправданного вторжения российских вооруженных сил. Президент России Владимир Путин выбрал преднамеренную войну, которая уже привела к катастрофическим человеческим жертвам и ненужным страданиям. Путин — агрессор, и он должен понести ответственность. На протяжении всей нашей истории мы усвоили этот урок: когда диктаторы не расплачиваются за свою агрессию, они вызывают еще больший хаос.
young people are dying with the command of this old man..Russia is a great country if they have  fight fascist..government..
The sound of the videos is not good
This war have big purpose bcz it's is the fight for existence of Russia . Those who knew reasons about it are in side of Russia. Undoubtedly, it is a grave danger for humanity , but it became the only option for Russia.
little putin thinks he owns more than 40 million Ukrainians... he is a world cancer in the 21st century.
Putin seems like the most rational out of the lot, thats scary.
Vladimir Hitler.   His playbook is almost exactly Hitler.. yet there are jerks supporting him, should not be surprised Hitler had many supporters also
He sigh of relief, to save face, he is trying to set conditions to make it appears, he is the winner of the conflict,!, but it,'s the other way around.
What the Hell are His Conditions? Hey Putin, how about stop Killing Innocent People.
Why would the world listen to Putin,  then Putin think he's cool and the whole world leaking his ass, I hope Ukraine fight to the end, because Russia is running out of Man power and ammunition,  if they have more supplies, he'll go on to invite the neighbouring country,  to be able to completely stop this madness is to destroy Russia completely so it will never invite any country,  look into history, he is unreliable, he is a lier,  he doesn't care what the world think, have no respect,  how many of his country men he track doe and poison,  the world will be safe with putin dead and his whole family full stop, the world would be the biggest fool,  1, stop the war, because he will regroup, resupply, and re-evaluate,  then he comes back more deadly there is no honesty,  no respect, no love, no sympathy,  he's a criminal all his life, that is the only life he knew, people who worship idol, they worship Satan,  the Catholic church faith is number one,  every war they initiate, why? To rule the world, God foretold in the bible,  to you think GOD is a lier, NO NO NO, GOD, knew what the Satan does, and GOD warn the whole world, read your bible, let God show you your way to eternal life.
Basically every video you can find on putin on YouTube is a month old wtf
Putin needs to be criminalized and charged for his invasion on innocent lives, forcefully taken and all those that continues on this course, should be jailed. This act is of self appetizers. GOD, give them their reward quickly. Amen.
Joseph Stalin  Vladimir Lenin  Vladimir Putin  Most Revolutionary Heroes of this Planet.
So many people left or were waning to leave Ukraine long before the conflict started. Please correct your infos. It is a crisis because all want to leave at once.
Do have to refill Ukraine
Oh goody I think I'll buy some stock in a refill to crank
Do those conditions include his ass going to a nice gulag? Otherwise he failed to make it a valid list of condition's.
Zelensky : the show must go on 🤡
Hello hello 👋
Russia shall stop attacking Ukraine ? Ukraine was only depending their territory. Don't dictate Ukraine their own destiny.  respect Ukraine people's freedom and sovereignty as independent country. stopped attacking Ukraine and war no More
They have no intention of ending this they obviously want it to escalate it to a world war status ,what better way to kill off 95percent of the population like the UN wants gone and has said so ,also a great way to seize complete control of the world.
Praying for the conflict to end!
Putin is correct.
Those conditions are so obvious!
And the demands are?????? Total surrender and become Russian??
Zelensky is going to save his political career first. Basically saving his ass first..🤣🤣
This was a month ago
Turkey, Azarbaidjan, India, Brazil, Germany, Russia and Ukraine must sit together and come to an agreement.
Those are stupid demands! They are almost laughable if it weren't for the devastating losses he caused. Basically he's saying "If I stop trying to take Ukraine, then Ukraine must give itself to me". Narcissistic overlord much!! Whoever has said Putin is smart must be kicking themselves now.
INDIA WITH RUSSIA ❤️🇮🇳
Putin is a cry baby.
when you take joker to be presiden he will destroy his country for fun
Now that He knows the whole World is sending weapon systems to Ukraine and his Armies will be completely destroyed he wants to "set conditions?" ... Even with his Poutine COOKED his psychopathy is unmoved. ... He has to be taken out right now.
Support Putin
There will be no violence,  If somehow we realise- how good it's to Live in Silence.
Oh please! Why would you title the story this way, let alone report it thusly framed. Shame shame on wion
Say no to Putin's conditions... Fight till the end comes what may first in first out and let him be thrown to hell.
Ofcourse he did lol
Putin  started  wàr  so he  should  stop  war.
Putin’s conditions will be that no one ☝️ in Ukraine 🇺🇦 will fart 💨 for one ☝️ year out of respect ✊🏾 for Putin
0:51Ukrain's invasion is not accepted, but the invasion of  Afghanistan, Iraq, Libia, Syria, was widely accepted, so stop  the spread of hypocrisy
Actually ..how many times ukrain will given chance to Russia ...if ukrain attack Moscow near Eu border what will happen to Russian civilize..?
Bullsheet, he already did the damage
No ay condicion para.tila sangre de esa personas ya .ganaron su patria ellos mismo no pertenesen .nada rusia porque ellos son los.heruers de su vitoria no tienen que quitar ni una. Parte de sus tierras porque fue. Pago con su sangre grandes guerreros el es Dios
I love how this channel covers news but we need to take a closer look at India and all the problems we face. This channel paints a picture like the whole world is messed up and India has no issues. As long as the rich stay rich, no one wants to fix the problems in india. Sad truth.
So ?.......What are Putin's conditions ?
Russia  is not ready to End this war....
Putin sets conditions ???? OMG he already lost his cruel war, it's up to Ukraine to set conditions
Russia gains nothing except a promise from Ukraine to not join NATO.  All the destruction and lives lost for nothing.  I think it's a Russian mistake.  Russian can't fight the will power of the Ukrainians.  Zelensky has already said that he will pursue neutrality last week.  This at least saves Kiev and more city destruction.  Frankly, if I were to run a military operation to topple the government of Ukraine, I'd flown in assassin paratroopers to round up the politicians and send them back to Russia to play cards in Siberia...........but not be brutal to the civilian population which only engenders the wrath of the world.  I doubt McDonald's will come back to Russia at any time soon.
,
Know what my answer would be. But it's Ukraine that has to reply. Quite sure their conditions for cease fire are much more significant and justified.
So he will listen to Turkey but not India
Russia is a terrorist group do not do not give
I think both sides have to stop fighting, not just Ukraine defending its own country from Russian invaders.
Thanks for your updates
Unbelievable and horrific.  In 2022 the world watches a modern country like Ukraine raised to the ground by a modern war machine.  Never in my life time did I think I would see this type of phenomenon.  It's normally a third world country under authoritarian rule like the Teleban.  You only see this in a movie not real life.  Destruction by one man and his ruling party.  I feel for Ukraine and it's people.
Hungary seems to have a normal leader  So dear President Putin  Maybe you’re not on your own  Let’s pray you can dismantle the globalists agenda 🙏🙏🙏
Stupid demands..
He won't pick on anyone his own size
No ceasefire you finish Putin , once you accept ceasefire, Putin will build up again his military I know his dirty tactics.
Why hasn't Russia conquered Ukraine yet? I thought they were a super power?
Better be his botox is falling apart
Putin said Ukraine shud stop fighting...means Ukraine shud surrender to Russia...😳
“If Ukraine stops fighting” hahahaha! Hahahaaa! Ha ha haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

ok so Ukraine won't join NATO but Russia will return Crimea back to Ukraine. Russia needs to learns it's not all about them. As reperations to the damage this fool has cause Ukraine returning Crimea is the least he can do and why not give some of the Russian territory to Ukraine.
To hell with Putin! Keep bombing Russian targets inside Russias borders! Russia has proven to be far weaker than anyone would have guessed!
russia's barbaric attack on ukraine kills innocent people. no contact with russia. i hate them! putin fo !!!
All fair weather friends you won't like the end result
Putin is 70 yrs old . So he thinks his demands still good when he is dead ?
How ended the Ceaușescu's ?
And the West will not win a war with Russia
Ukraine will never meet or stick to the anything win the world give him every thing
Puti is the most neta
Completely useless video. Offers no additional information than what's been said in the title
If Ukraine submits... What happens to all the artillery donated ? Fyi
We alrredy know ;  Putin is esquizofrénico. And don’t care about the Russia Citizen’s and Ukrain Citizens.
Pa condition ka pa
There is no possible way that Ukraine can give up their weapons or military or putin will murder hundreds of thousands ,imprison people and enslave people that for posing a threat to putins Stalin like rule...  And when putin doesn't get what he wants he is bound to spread this war even if it means getting his ass kicked
I propose regime change for both countries.. Both countries’ leaders are greedy, corrupt, undemocratic, violent, and dumb as shit.. just like the Titanic’s captain... I'm no better, but if you’re going to cause WW you’re dumbest of the dumb.. Eat your billions and let us be!
These are not meetings but big farses that lead nowhere
WTF??? What are those conditions??
Putin should put a bounty on the heads and wealth of the British Royal family known as the Windsor's.
Putin has no ability to dictate conditions , he may only accept conditions from now on .
A microscopic fly drone could take him out
What bullshit! Tell us what his demands are!
He needs to put a condom on his button finger.
PROXIMITY SALUTED
The video has no point
WION is the only news source i trust
Putin is a good man waited until America is so  weak to start a war. Biden is unfit to hold office clearly never would have happened under Biden
Special military Operation... Kills men, woman and children and instead of targeting only military facilities, bombs anything and everything. Russian people most be so proud of this outstanding president.
Yeah? Well , remember when Europe APPEASED Hitler and the Nazi's...How did that work out .Lose Putin now before he repeats history.
Screw Putin! Let Russia starve!🖕🇺🇸
Putin is only qualified for making. Chaos but not for constructive business /good incomes .
Putin’s “kind” way of telling the world where to stick it. 😳😳😳
Nooop so dad always people dies from war ZELENZKY IS SAFE HE CREAT WAR... DONT STOP CATCH ZELENZKY AND END WAR!!!!
But Putin said he had no intention of invading Ukraine although he was having a practice run playing war games surrounding her borders. How can his word be worth anything now? Besides unless there is hefty censorship from the Western point of view, the rhetoric coming from Putin now is threatening and downright scary! At least Boris won’t have a fit and lock me up if I say his hair is funny, or his policies stink!
No condition of putin will be fulfilled.  War will be continued up  to death.
russia invaded ukraine and murders people, bombards all cities, russia is terrorists , putin is a barbarian !
putin !!! not russia!!will nott win ,putin is shittting himself
If ukraine stops fighting meaning if ukraine will surrender then they will have no choice but to meet all demands of putin.
I love u mister poutine
Before u listen they do not mention what the conditions r.
We should send in pepper pig Bob the builder they do better than NATO what a joke proof his army is weak could be sort 2 weeks.  The Biden can make a film in Hollywood USA guy's and GIRLS your brave 1s us Britain's will walk by your side. John Rooney st.annes
Putin is such a creep.  What kind of deal is that?  He wants Ukraine to acquiesce 100%, and he will stop killing them.  What garbage!  Fight on!
What are the demands ?
No demands mentioned
there's an open door for peace take it
Biden? This better not be true
Putin? I heard you found something and more near a nuclear reactor. It has been confirmed that Putin did find children that were mutilated
"Stop running away, and I will stop trying to eat you....🦖 ".               : )
SICKENING STALIN' PUTIN PEDDLES HIS LIES AT WAR RALLY
Russia would have been packing and tucking his tail if Biden wasn't owned by Russia and China
HAHAHAHAHAHAHHA!!!!!!!!
Stop fighting? That means Ukraine has to surrender?😜😜😜
Russin & Ukrain soldier killing each for a foolish war nobody will wins.  In the next cease fire both sides should form their own army and march on Moscow and loudly sing Stop the War  Stop the killing I won't kill cause I'm not willing
Likely one of Russia's main conditions is the most obvious one. For Ukraine not to be a part of NATO.
Wait...Moscows demand is that Moscow's demands be met...so YOU NEVER SAY WTH THEY ARE
We need to close the sky United State we sound like we're scared of pudding if we need a world war III then that's what it be we can't allow him to repeat history what's next
Putin to declare victory,mission accomplish ,then pull out ofbukraije.
He's 10 steps ahead of everyone.
As far as a communist country where the leader wants to rule forever Putin could be worse
Если Путин собирался сделать это с Украиной, то Путин должен был сказать нет независимости Украины с самого начала, а не сейчас, в последнюю минуту. кто такой путин, чтобы называть других неразумными, когда сам унижает себя и является дебилом. Он никогда не победит. он все потеряет, и России-матушки больше не будет. только Террористическая Россия. Ничто из того, что делает Путин, не помогает России или кому-либо еще. Путин не президент, он преступник, который заслуживает жизни в тюрьме БОЛЬШОЙ РЕБЕНОК, который сходит с ума, когда не получает то, что хочет, без последствий. Я счастлив, что он показал себя своему народу, теперь люди действительно знают, что он за человек. Не человек.
So what are Putin's conditions? And what are Moscow demands?
Falou, falou, não disse nada de novo.
Who is invading Moskwa ,lol
Just blow up the planet then we will have world peace. When everyone is gone there's no one left to fight. Problem solved. I mean we all gonna die anyway.
This is why we need dislikes youtube. You wasted my damn time
Conditions kinda like holding the country hostage eh?
No condition Russia is weak .It is time to attack .The world must come together and attack Kim un and putin and other dictators .
To Hell with You PUTIN😡🤬you don't have d right to demand when you have killed lots of people!? Senseless killing ,you are a criminal, a murderer😡it's only Russians who can bring him down...try people power🙏🇵🇭
Putin is loosing the war so that he is not in position to bring up any condition. Instead, Russian must turn Putin in to the military tribunal court for war crimes in exchange for lifting sanctions.
I support Putin.
Atleast they'll stop
The evil barbarian in the guise of Putin is conducting this worldwide campaign of white people's extinction by invading Slaughter killing Ukrainians they are genuine white people !!!!  After Ukraine, which white country in Eastern Europe and Europe will come next !!!!!  In the next generation, people who White Skin people will become a minority in the world because Southeast Asian countries give birth and reproduce 2-3 times more than white and white people.
Well seems to me, if the Ukrainian people wants to put a ceasefire into motion why don't they stop fighting.  Or do the Ukraine people want to continue the fighting?

Putin is an evil war criminal…. He deserves nothing and the world is against him.
Ukraine should agree to all of those points to end the attack.  THEN,   Ukraine should form whatever alliances it wants to. Ukraine should take Crimea back and imprison those who stole it from them Those living in regions that feel kinship with Russia, should MOVE to Russia. Russia must pay to rebuild everything it destroyed , AND pay the families of murdered people  the equivalent of one million US dollars each.  for a start...
What a stupid click bait video.
the russian military is war criminals, putin the barbarian !!  ODPOWIEDZ
Putin's genocide will end when the Russians get the heck out of Ukraine.  Ukraine will end if Ukraine quits. That won't happen. The Russians are going to lose Crimea, Donbass, and be ruined militarily and economically. There may not be a building still standing in Ukraine , they will never stop and the United States will make sure they have all the resources they need to run them out. Even if Europe won't help. The Russians will be hungry this winter , but Ukraine won't be , we will feed them , we will take care of them and their  people . Russia will be a pariah among the world. All because of one man,  Vladimir Putin . He will hang , before this is over.

War criminal Putin only wants his way to stop,the fighting.
Do not fall for conditions no conditions it's your country it's your freedom no one has a say how to live your life in your country never you have god giving rights to live and exist
Pray for, peace, love, and harmony, all around the world!!!  And keep repeating it. Peace Love Harmony all around the world.  Maybe someone will listen.
Russia 🇷🇺 has no say in conditions he was the aggressor he gets nothing
Thanks for explaining what the demands are
Ukraine did not start the fighting; Russia did. Russia must stop fighting to ensure a peaceful resolution of the conflict.
How does this wonderful kind man explain his invasion of Northern Syria? Using the sliding Western scale on”How evil or good is your leader” where is the Great Turkish leader. I imagine he is on the acceptable side of evil A 5 out of 10. He the last guy on earth that should be condemning anyones actions.
What are the conditions????
Putin 🐷
He always did that. He does not have the right to give orders to Ukraine.
Russia’s conditions, the total surrender of Ukraine! This guy is no different from Hitler this is why this conflict doesn’t end until Putin is dead!
🤣🤣🤣 Those terms are hilarious!!!
Never trust U.S like what duterte believe
Gago!!!
Even if Russia is driven out of Ukraine, it is now obvious that the civilized world must do something different in the long term. The definition of insanity is to keep doing the same thing and expecting a different result.  Instead of complicated and inconsistent sanctions, it would be simpler to just to put massive taxes on all imports, and only give waivers to free countries, and incremental discounts to non-free countries for democratic and human rights improvements. Cost of living increases can be offset by domestic tax reductions and stimulus payments from windfall tariff revenue. And most importantly; People love discounts, but hate mandates.   Write your representative today and demand consistent, incentive based economic pressure.
What are those  demands? Or it pictures and videos of president Edorgan shaking hands with the bully of Moscow.
Useless news. Click bait catchers. Bye.
Not sure why everyone is all annoyed that she didn't say what the conditions are, its probably because she doesn't know them yet. This newscaster speaks more truth and honesty than any mainstream news in North America, so I think we can forgive the fact that she is not privy to that info about what the conditions are just yet.
HOOLIGAN
USSR is the final goals of the world.  😎😎😇😇
Whats India doing,  f#$"%ck all , thats what
How do you click bait and get almost 6 millions views without even explaining the demands?
Agreements with live Communist don't work!
So a politician can can cause the death / murder of women and children and get away with it a ?.
Did I miss what Putin’s “demands” are??
Putin should be the one making the good gesture of not fighting. They are the ones that invaded
I like the BRAVEHEART William Wallace response best! Here are Scotland's terms. Lower your flags, and march straight back to England, stopping at every home to beg forgiveness for 100 years of theft, rape, and murder. Do that and your men shall live. Do it not, and every one of you will die today.  Cheltham: You are outmatched. You have no heavy cavalry. In two centuries no army has won without--.  William: I'm not finished. Before we let you leave, your commander must cross that field, present himself before this army, put his head between his legs, and kiss his own ass.
🤮🤮🤮
Typical twisted mind of a tyrant. The only way to stop the war is for the aggressor to back off!!
the Russian army is murdering people like barbarians, attacking Ukraine and bombing everything. This is not a war, this is genocide, this is terrorism. Putin is a killer !!!
I wouldn’t trust Putin...he needs to accept defeat and report that to the Ukraine President.  Even then...never turn your back on Putin!
西方都是邪恶的，加油普京，你是正义的，在中国发生的新冠来的太奇怪了，事情从中美贸易战以后香港又爆发暴动也有美国特工在背后策划，然后就是在中国发动生化病毒  一系列事情都来的怎么巧合吗，
So what are the demands. This was a waste of 2 minutes. I suppose it could have been longer.
I find this style of reporting obnoxious.
Putin has started something he cannot halt. Ukraine is going to ruin him. His days are numbered, his forces are doomed. His citizens are in revolt.
Ukraine says “shove it”
Saya adalah seorang warga negara INDONESIA.  We love PUTIN ❤ We love RUSIA ❤
Western society is superior, NATO would absolutely destroy Russia and its  dictators.
WTF what are the conditions
Stop trying to control anyone! Spread love, joy acceptance and peace! That's how to ensure no more wars!
Demands, but we won’t explain what they are or mention that we don’t know what they are
PUTIN IS A DEAD MAN WALKING. TRUTH, VICTORY AND FREEDOM TO THE HEROES OF THE UKRAINE !!!
Putin is just gaslighting everyone. He has no interest in ending the war in Ukrainian, and fully intends to take this to other Slavic nations if he succeeds in Ukraine. This is what narcissistic, and sedistic people do to gain or maintain power over other humans. Narcissism is at an epic high among the oligarchy and the power structure they've built around the world in the government over the last 40 years. It truly has become a matter of them, the less than one percent of the world population, and the rest of us.   Money is a social construct meant for the good of society as a whole, but it's been turned against humanity as a whole, and that's what we must address. The Russian oligarchy gave power to Putin for personal gain nothing more, and the people of Russia, failing themselves have failed to stop that, just as the rest of us have in our own countries.   Everyone must know that the military and police that are used to control societies have civilian families they would have to murder for these oligarchs to stay in power, and monetarily they too are slaves to wage, and captured in a public needs regressive nation. Talk with your sons and daughters. Would it be mind bending to renounce the familiar bond, I think so. I write this out of concern for my own family, friends, and the rest of the human race suffering under regressive authoritarianism.
President Zelensky used to support Israel to massacre Palestine, now it's Ukraine's turn to be massacred by Russia, Zelenski is now alone, no country can help you, this is God's revenge, huraaaa greetings from INDONESIA to RUSSIA..!!🇲🇨♥️🇷🇺
Maybe you could mention what the demands are ?? If Russia stops fighting turns around and returns to Russia the war will be over If Ukraine puts down its guns and stops fighting there's no more Ukraine
I think Moscow’s demand is favorable to Russia but not to Ukraine 🇺🇦  Putin should be fairer: make it more win-win for Ukraine and Russia.

Tell Putin to “shove it”
I am amazed by your courage vladimir putin, I also agree that you are against the American government which often defame Christians, but I also hope that you are careful with Islamic countries that support you. sometimes close friends are more evil and cunning than foes showing fangs. but I pray for you may God grant you wisdom and long life. Shalom
To stop this war, Putin just has to stop using Botox in his brain . . . . that would end this war immediately!  And Mister Botox, just one info. This is not an economic war against Russia it is just a small economic operation, and will end if we reach our goals, and we are getting close to it :D  Is this Botox Putin, really so "smart"/dumb? Can't believe . . . .
soldiers that kill innocent children and woman are not soldiers but murderers and criminals. A dictator that orders those killing needs to be trialed for war to humanity.
Putin, you are evil from hell
I hate click bait titles
Dear Wladi: niet no peace now!  DEAR Erdi, why castle for u? .....does not make u King, peasant remains one
Stops fighting? Meaning what they are being attacked. Confused 😕 😕?
There r more comings crimer informer little rat had the king jealousy best than others, Own Children wife mothe c blined  SHAMED SHAME ON  ITS OWN a red rose. Ahead input unconditionally crimed till the end unconditionally output
So, the “Conditions” are, what?  ? I’m feeling like a mushroom. I’m being kept in the dark, and fed BS.
Fun fact: most of his conditions was his concern for years, but no one listed to him. Now good luck zelensky
Muslims think Putin's cool!
Ukraine stops fighting first? Thats not gonna happen
Putin's demands:  Mykraine or Nokraine!!!
Latest update: Russian President Vladimir Putin sets conditions to end Moscow's invasion in Ukraine WION: YES!
So Russia is no longer demanding "denazification" of Ukrainian?!  How strange as this was one of their stated aims.  Putin  know he is losing the war in Ukraine and his economy is rapidly sliding into the gutter. Soon Russia's demands will get less and less - until they are begging for peace.
And NOW China IS GOING AFTER TAIWAN!! LOOK IT UP!
"Never trust Russians because Russians don't even trust themselves". Otto von Bismarck "Anyone who has ever looked into the glazed eyes of a soldier dying on the battlefield will think hard before starting a war". Otto von Bismarck
I see the video putin put demand
Condition #1. Send Comrades Joe and Hunter Biden to Russia for negotiations with China...
There not that stupid Russia... Keep it going Ukraine
Speak slowly so everybody can understand don't so fast
Conditions?? When ppl are dead means Putin death is the only outcome
All a scam to have something to blame on the stock market
So what's the conditions/terms? Why in the hell would anybody report such but not include in that report what the conditions are? Makes no sense whatsoever.
WTF you don't get to make any demands you invade you started a war you have 2 choices pull out say your sorry to all the people of Ukraine and make peace that is all you deserve are the war will continue do not give up your freedom and president of Ukraine do not give up on ur people and your country he deserves nothing look at the life's he took  Russia deserves a kick in the ASS
Nobody* Wion: Putin sets conditions to end Moscow's invasion, which means Putin sets conditions to end Moscow's invasion so basically Putin sets conditions to end Moscow's invasion because Putin said Putin sets conditions to end Moscow's invasion.
WORLD WAR III, knockin on your door. PUTIN NO WAY TO GO. 🤣😆🤣🤣😅😆
wow what a crap news station. wont even say what the demands are.
​ @Leo Nas  Because Crimea is a buffer zone. NATO would use it to build a U.S military base
I want my 1 minute and 52 seconds of my life back please.
Why the NERVING, DISTURBING MUZAK?
Like they said give me your weapons and we will not invade now stop fighting against us and we will have peace don’t trust it
Useless info!!!
Putin wants to stop Nato not Ukraine.
Putin's hungry for power, like biden....same evil spirit possessing them. Ukraine people don't want to live(exist) under russian rule so they must fight. God grant them victory! America, watch and learn from the Ukrainian people.
What's the conditions? Stupid news headline
Putin has only 1 condition is to replace Ukrainian government with his people and take over all Ukrainian resources because he thinks that all the money he gets from Russian resources is not enough for him.
I feel like Putin won't keep his promise
Диктатор Путин — военный преступник, и мир должен дать этому убийце правильный ответ. Этот геноцид - мусор, который не должен рассматриваться как человек.
So when This happens in Syria no one cares
Alright already. Seems like you neglected to mention those conditions on your click bait video.
Never will bi war end until people want to refuse or armay get will free
One more thing never ever trust Russia especially Vladimir putin a killer and lier    Death to Russia !
Russia can never be treated by NATO and USA like a terror group, Russia is among others,a world super power, and the sanctions imposed on Russia can as well affect the imposers and badly the poor countries, let's hope Ukraine has agreed to the 3 conditions to end war
Mr Putin the World will inform him of the Pease conditions required FACT ...J
I hope the Russians win
According to Putin, "Russia will hold its military operation if Ukraine will stop fighting." This is how mad, cunning, and stupid this Putin is. He is invading and attacking Ukraine and he wanted them to stop fighting.
Better the end of the world than be slaves to Putin and China.
Good! Let him feel what it’s like to have bombs drop on his people. Putin is a wicked man
What is that ??????
Ukrsine also has conditions that should be respected.
Putin's grip on the Russian people is slipping away.  He has made a great mistake with his corruption and stealing from the people of Russia.  Alexi Nevalny is the true leader of Russia.
We love president petin and me and all family support him and also wants to fight against America and Ukraine along with heart and soul and with our bodies love u peutin salute to peutin
1:33 conditions? Or STUPIN 💩 just want to ask UKRAINE 🇺🇦 to surrender?
Imaginatory doodle of noncence exemplified gimmicks a scam Shananagins fairwell stay well be well
What invasion? I thought it was a Russian 'Special Military Operation'? It's too late to discuss Putin's demands. His days are numbered at the ICC for War Crime against Humanity for killing civilians including children. He might as well enjoy the days he has left on either his new US$100+ million yacht or his $Billion estate.
Who started it frist
What's the demand?
VIVA RUSSIA, VIVA PUTTIN, STOP INVASIONS OFF MASONERIA S.U.A, NATO, RASCISTS,AND HUMANS BROKS WITH THEY MICROCHIPS PUT IN HUMANS BODY (ARMA MICROBIOLOGICA CHIMICA MOLECULARE-THE STINKY MARONE GUMM)AND THEY GRAVITY,THEY AYR FORCE, OUT WITH S.U.A AND ENGLAND OF EUROPE.
This ends with Putin in a Body Bag.  After all that's the retirement package for Dictators.
Wow there is no DEMANDS REPORTED but the title 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Zolenskyy must go..save Ukranian lives.
Its all started by NATO
Putin  he is a evil man with a Napoleon complex personality.His own people have caught 9nto him and turning against him.
If Ukraine stops fighting? Duh! Crimea...
Finally, we know.
Does anyone realize that Ukraine actually turned down the offer to join NATO to keep peace with Russia and they did this a while back there was never the thought that Ukraine would actually in tornado putting is fucking delusional
Well done Russia you have dragged your name down into the dirt. Your army does not want to fight in this illegal war and those that do are facing righteous justice.
Ukraine will stop fighting when those invading Orks get out of Ukraine. The Russian Army is being defeated because it is running on lies.
Yes well too late, he already bombed everything and killed hundreds of children and civilians. Now he needs to shut up and listen to conditions, not exclaim them. Psycho
Putin is not going to stop the war unless Ukraine decides never to join nato.. because if Ukraine joins nato then countries like USA AND UK are gonna have all kind of military operations going on in Ukraine which is too close to putins doorstep for his likings
I hope Russia wins and Ukraine's President is put on trial. Keep the Sanction's on  Putin,  Dumb assed Joe, who cares Gas is at 10 dollars a gallon????
You act like our worthless government isn't corrupt.  Right. Ask Bobble head doll Joe, if he can stop sniffing women's panties or hair.!!!!
Putin, the child killer.
Click Bait no information at all
Auntie's hair looks brilliant today.
ukraine will fight till their last man is standing, rite now russian tanks operiate best with a fuel sourse , skid steer vehicles , on tracks are not made for mud  it builds up track comes of, or they get stuck dig in deeper, sitting ducks
The demands are....????????
Putin's way or no way Is what he is saying.down with Putin 😩
There are NO conditions Mr Putin, the world does not negotiate with another HITLER. You better run, because you WILL be held ACCOUNTABLE.
Go stick your conditions
All that treasure in Russian Hardware WOW 😲. That must be embarrassing for you 🤣

You guys got the good one's Right 🤣
Putin isn't setting conditions Zalinski is Who you spinning for?  Did you guy's pick another Looser and didn't tell us 🤣 Good luck with those Russian Tanks $ 5 million dollar dud. 😂
Putin never keep his promises and his history demonstrate this. Why should Ukraine stop fighting when Russia is the one that is invading? It doesn't make any sense at all
If Ukraine stops fighting?  Ukraine is not the aggressor.  How do you stop fighting if someone is attacking you?
liar. He just wants to put in his puppet leader.
Putin Vladimir is creating a big mistake of embarrassing for the whole worlds.  Putin Vladimir has malicious mind blowing up the peace in Ukraine.  Putin is a evil monster.
Wanted and dead Putin dies
Ugh
Dont deal with the enmity bomb Russia let them rebuild Moscow
Yeah first Ukraine has to "stop" fighting. They have to surrender. Literally white flags giving up. Well no shit Sherlock. That's Russia winning the war. That's not a negotiation. If the Ukrainians quit fighting, and they don't put up white flags, then that means they will get murdered. Like putting your gloves down in a boxing match and not telling the opponent you quit. You'll get KTFO.
What are those demands? A covid jab?
Would Mr. Putin accept a referendum to hear the voice of the Ukranian people together with an immediate unconditional ceasefire from Russia for 4 weeks to effect same!
Support Putin entirely,Bidden's fault.
Basically you guys are dramatically saying Putin won't stop until the original aim of the invasion is achieved
It will end he hit a childs.      Hospital he has no choice to he going drag in usa and he die wont last to he drag in world
*Ukraine is a region of White Russia. It was never a separate country. Similar to Tamil Nadu. How about Tamil Nadu joins  Microsoft & leaves Indian Hindutsva to become Bill Gates Christian Country?*   Hope the above proposal makes you morons to THINK!!   God will pulverize entire earth with the nuclear bombs these moron NATO has.. THINK where you will end after death: Eternal Hell??
That is Good Idea for all Europe and around the World. No War enough the Corona Virus.
Nuke Russia first.
*Hey, you Indians!! We want to see a decent Muslim anchor in beautiful hijab with the usual smart calm logical brain to be reading news unbiased, justly & honestly* YOU LIE...
What are the conditions? What kind of news report is this?
Думало извещение о его смерте
You see how thoughtful Pres Putin have been, wanted to bring peace between his country...yet EU, and other country just initiating war inorder to condemning Russia ...EU, and US are just guilty as well...
Up the screws on putin and his oligarchs. No surrender.
What putin wants isn't to end the war with a peace agreement, he wants a no condition surrender of Ukraine.
Who going to believe Putin once a lair always a lair.
Good morning, Putin is crazy bloody man!! He murdered on Ukraine, little childrens and old people's!!! Freedom for Ukraine peoples, bay from Czech Republic 🇷🇺⚔️☠️😵😢🐷👿👹👎
Listen to mother russiaaaaa
Does putin think that the world is blind ?
It's Russia's downfall if it can't conquer Ukraine. Russia will become the laughing stuff of the world.
Pray God is in control with gremlin PUTIN OUTAGE demands.  He has no excuses for his actions his another Hitler.
The demand of a rapist to allow penetration, is exactly what Putin thrusts on each nation.
Seriously? I wonder if he stated those conditions with a straight face. Everyone already knows they don't honor their cease-fire agreements. "Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me." Ukraine should respond, "Leave our borders and we'll stop fighting." Ukrainians are not stupid people.
This is all BS !! He’s not going to get what he wants and he knows it. The Ukrainians will fight till the end !!💪🏽💪🏽
this is so stupid no news agency telling what or why putin attacked ukraine they did not even mention the demands
Ukraine is independent country they have the right to join the NATO if they want. Coward Russian dictator government afraid from the NATO while Russia have 5000 nuke still it's coward dictator country. The Russian ruble lost 50% of his price. Meaning Russia GDP lost 50%. Sanctions work well. Support Ukraine🇺🇦❤️🇪🇬 Love from Egypt.
NATO OLIGARCH AND KABAL DON'T CARE ABOUT UKRAINE... WHY? THEY'RE ALL AFRAID OF RUSSIA,..
What the hell does putin want
People have to liberate themselves, because liberation is not a single act. It's a question of eternal vigilance. Otherwise, you'll just become enslaved by someone else.
This invasion is murder and theft.  Russia is stealing Ukraine and is murdering any person who resists that crime.
All countries against putin should not put any news about him on the air or in their newspapers.  Putin lives on publicity.
Russia has had a history of forcing it's army to fight. "Deserters will be shot"   Not sure if that applies today but I bet there's serious consequences for any Russian soldier that abondons his orders
No one profits from bloodshed and death but Lucifer himself. We are the sons and daughters of God. We should be loving each other not killing each other.
Again, its not invasion its a just a leader who care in his countrys security to western scumbug!! Long live putin, im a pilipino and im stand in russia!!, Because the american is hypocrits!!!
Please 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏 stop war Mr president PUTIN. I'M AFRAID SCARED NUCLEAR WEAPONS
Purely Arrogance!  You'll fall one day Putin..  THat's for sure.
Everyday I pray for peace of both country,stop war peace ✌ 🙏 many civilians are suffering.
So being a slave from putin. I would say ,no way.
So Putin whants Ukraine  to be puppets
Is this hostage that he has demands. Our politics are getting funnier
He has no right to demand anything and he isnt owed ANYTHING..
Ha idont trust putin  she is  war maniac
It’s Russia that needs to ceasefire and get out of Ukraine !! They are the invading army Ukrainians are only defending their country, ! And if he is considering a ceasefire then he must be realising that he can’t win, and Ukraine are succeeding, keep it up Ukraine you are winning 👍
He is dictator, not president.
That is the best solution to end the war. That Ukraine must follow  the demand of Moscow. Doesn't mean that they were afraid or surrender. But for the peace of both of them.  One  must lower his pride, set aside personal interest. Life is the Paramount importance  above all! God bless!✌️✌️✌️🌼🙏👏💌
You can't bargain with him, he and his regime needs to be removed👏💪
God bless Russia
Oh it's so much clearer now. Thanks
Go to the next, until other side... Until the end!!!
putin❤️❤️❤️
What is Moscows demand?
Mr Putin alert your Nuclear Forces 50 megaton H bombs & target this aggressive war mongers. You see there will be peace on earth
They should try and reach a compromise to stop this war,getting worse for the sake of the children.
In the las
Moscow ought to have mercy on people suffering innocently for this war
Talán magyarul........
I say since Ukraine has jets and some long-range missiles, there should be a secret run into Moscow and bomb the hell out of the Russian places Putin is known to be, then get the heck out of there! Those woke individuals who do not like Trump, because they believed everything the media says is the gospel, should realize while Trump was in power, he told Putin the following: " If you invade Ukraine, I will bomb Moscow! Notice the difference here in strength between our current feckless president and Trump. While Trump was in, Russia did nothing!
Good decision sir Putin
Russia must not let this massive opportunity of ruling asia slip out of its hands.  Remember : USA is on backfoot for a few years Chinese economical might is uncontrollable. China will use Russian power to break into European economy. This will create huge opportunity for Russian manufacturing sector plus oil and gas supplies.  Be friendly to Ukraine people so in coming years they would value their Relationship with Russia over Europe.
He's Hitler! Pathetic little man!
Only Erdagon..trusted by Putin...
Russians are vvv sad they lost McDonald's cola and all junk. They also make a billion a day because the sanctions doubled the energy and all Russia products prices. Without those the western block is dead
🙏💖😇
The Ukrainians are Kievan Russians and not fighting. The cabal puppet government is paying mercenaries to hide the dirty business
Thank you for no news at all.
Putin can’t be trusted, that’s been proven. Does anyone haven’t learned a lesson?
Playing political games with people's lives then blaming each other
Putin your lucky I don't live in Russia, you would be in the morgue.
Stay strong Ukraine! Hope you win this battle !! These tyrants Putin Morrison Arden Biden & Johnson should be stopped!!!! Then the world would be a better place!!!!
Possible but ... if Nuke proof bunker could survive break up of the Geo-plates and float around on molten Sea
Let's put all our minds together and brainstorm answers.. is there any one willing to recieve and process those ?( I'm too old ): I've learned that in such a process ,one needs to accept even the seemingly crazy ones as the might springboard into  a really good answer ....then let the discussion start...shit stirrers need not apply
Damn antichrist
Putin is now trying to save face he didn't think Ukraine could fight back how wrong he was let's hope the good people of Russia  now get rid of this child killing  dictator
Putin should not be allowed  to make condition.We are suppose to set the term.don't  be fooled .Putin is crafty as a serpent.
Mhhhm. Especially Erdogan wants peace on the region, whilst selling tons of Biractar drones to Ukraine.
He needs strapping to an icbm and launched into deep space.
Putin, you're a liar boy
You missed the part of what Moscow demands are..
My freind putin cool down no problem may the lord jesus be with you thought this time of trouble he will help you and guid you thought the poss you are going thought it not easy to leave a country alone but the lord jesus will help you , just like you kissed the lord baby jesus on his head god be with you and i i praying that you remember the catholic church you were at god bless you and stop the fighting sir my kind regards to russia
Thank you Lord for answer Prayer
vladimir pootin.
this is really idiotic waste of my time
That's all fine and dandy. Just don't get TALI-BIDEN in there to discuss anything with these LEADERS of their respective countries.   Please DO NOT INVITE the USA installed potus, because Obiden will FRACK everything up if he shows up.
Hope that president Putin dcsion come in reality.Peace not War.we can not solve a proBlem if you add another problem.sana magka totoo.
So this Pig wants them to turn around and take it up the ass, and then he wants them to make breakfast because the abuse is just beginning
necgociations no war
Putin Putin you're beginning stupid papo.
WHY ISNT ISSUING AN ARREST WARRANT TO PUTIN FOR WAR CRIMES THE NARRATIVE??? ITS A FORMALITY ANY COURT CAN DO WHETHER IT BE ENFORCEABLE OR NOT...THATS NOT THE POINT...ITS THE MESSAGE THAT NEEDS TO BE SENT AROUND THE WORLD!!!!
Yes terminate Putin by dissecting his head. The Russian people hate Putin also.
Putin should get the chair
Putin doesn't give a f.k about anyone. He does what he wants. God bless Putin Russia
where is Modi ji😀😘🙉
He isn't in any place to make any demands. Don't go for his b.s.
It is not going to change anything lol
It's time to finish Putin that million dollar easey pay somebody to assantion Putin one pullet done
Moscows demand are that Ukraine surrenders its sovereignty to Russia and becomes a part of Russia under Russian rule. The Ukrainian people are free, to "meet such demands ", would mean to deny themselves their freedom as humans. I'd rather die on my feet fighting for freedom, than live in captivity.
Can't be trusted..need to be "dealt with" PRAYING FOR UKRAINE
Stupid USA u get want u want in the past so give my friend my iron rod his desire and everything go good
If Biden call the Saudi's , and they refused to answer the call, you in India wouldn't have slightest idea that even. (Fokery News).
Z
Every country should have a stockpile of nuke!!!!  Then there will be no war.
Putin doesn't need to set demands. Russia is on the verge of total collapse. We all just have to outlast them.
Time for the world to put Putin in the trashcan. He threatens nukes, but knows if he tries that, his entire country will die. The truth has to be spread in Russia. It still is the Soviet Communist Regime. State owned and not much for the little guys.
By retracting the agreement after the Warsaw Pack was disbanded ,    the west totally destroyed the agreement by furthering their NATO membership through to Eastern  Europe . Putin was to go back to the initial agreement and is entitled to have that agreement restored. If fact Putin has proposed this just a few days ago to Zelenski.  If he Zelenki will do that , this war with Russia and Ukraine will be over.   The Bushes,  Obama John Cain have meddled and created this whole scenario as per usual The USA is to blame for yet another war . Poor citizens of Ukraine So sad for them they are the ones suffering .
What a nonsense news?
So, total surrender to communists that murdered millions last century or? Yeah, fight on Ukraine
Both are killing people!!
Putins CRIMES AGINST HUMANITY!! bidens CRIMES AGINST HUMANITY ON OUR BOARDER!!
To putin as the guy said in INDEPENDENCE DAY...", UP YOURS!! (putin)
Lol conditions
What was that? My english is not good. What are the conditions?
Nukem all
There will be no peace war is coming to us all
Ukraine is fighting for the WORLD! They win and we all win and Putin is gone! They lose and were screwed and will have to fight Putin someday on NATO soil and NATO blood will be shed! We have to support Ukraine 110%, they might kick someone's butt! God bless Ukraine!
Looks like Putin is accepting the reality that Russia is losing!  He’s going to Plan B.  By the time the Ukrainians are through with his absolutely incompetent and ridiculous military, he’ll be proposing Plan Z!  Leave now while there is still time.
Key Demands
putler conditions? RIP PUTLER
He's talking his view as russian people be threat by us and nato, how about ukraine people their view seeing russian as the threat,  listen both side
Ok, so what's the demands? Useless video.
He can't win now. His reputation is done. No one other than other tin pot dictatorships will deal with Russia, Now,  He totally f**ked up. He's no chess player. He made all the wrong moves. He has made Russia even more isolated. When are the Russian people finally going to wake up?
F+++ putin
Люди хватит воевать!!! Объясните пожалуйста, почему все врут? По российскому тв говорят что в украине нацисты бомбят мирных а россия освобождает беззащитных людей, по украинскому тв говорят россия пришли захватить их земли, по немецкому что россия убивает мирных жителей украины😵😖🤦кто тут говорит правду? А кто врёт?🤔.  много невинных жертв на Донбассе за 8 лет😔 На дворе 21 век, миру мир! Давайте жить дружно!
There is no winner in war, only the living and the dead.
WION - Please in detail report what Putin’s demands are. Also please report that the Ukrainian Russian speaking people in the breakaway regions have been under attack by shelling and far right militias for the last 8 years. Please report how Neo Nazi groups like AZOV Battalion are being funded by USA, Canada and surprisingly Israel. There is a lot more substance, facts and information missing from this current report. Ukraine Prime Minister Zelensky has lost control of his military when far right groups currently engaging Russia and the Donbass regions have so far refused any negotiations and have pledged to ignore and prevent any cease fire from taking effect. These videos are easily found and validated - look up AZOV Battalion and understand the truth of the matter at hand when Putin is asking publicly for neutrality and that he will deNazify Ukraines Military.  Your reporting is pretty good but we need the relative deep details that paint the whole picture. All of this could have been prevented if the Minsk Agreement had been honoured.
Jak může ta odporná lidská zrůda nechat bombardovat dětskou nemocnici a porodnici. Chce se mi z vás zvracet rusové 🤮🤮🤮😈👹😡🥵🤮💪🤮
✨🕊✨
Dictators never win the war!!PUTIN go and join your Forces!don't hide like a rat!!! Praying for Ukrainians people🇺🇦🙏🇮🇱
Don't mess with Russia they've been saying that for decades well I guess we found out what happens.
I thought Putin was a tough guy and wanted to fight? Welcome to the new way of war where you get target sanctioned to death.
GLORY TO UKRAINE 🇺🇦
Not a war between countries - but a reflection Putins inadequate personality and cowardice! Russians are brainwashed into believing they have to follow one man’s egotistical journey to murder and control in order that he feels better about himself! Russia turn your arms against your real enemy - Putin and his cronies
Stupid earth inhabitants always making their species to have a hideous existance , cannot just live and let live have to harm innocent humans
The USA has had more people come in illegally over the border then Ukraine people leaving in 1 yeR
Putin is a war criminal.
The sanctions are in place to hurt the U.S. economy. Manchin and Sinema stopped plan A so onto plan B.
It's time for thr UN to grow a set of balls.  Just why do we support it for setting on their  a####. They need to send troops and military hardware to Ukraine.  If they USA needs to quit wasting my tax dollars on it.
Putin is the best 💪🏻 ❤️🇮🇩🇷🇺🖤 Uraaa Stop SUPERMACY Zionist USA and NATO
Yu say nothing on this video
We are suddenly living in a world where Erdogan is a moderate and a peace-maker! 😅 If that doesn't work, we'll send Freddie Kruger to go reason with the ol' blighter.
Moscows demands you do as we say ,Ukrainian demands unconditional surrender.
This video is a waste of storage and bandwidth.
Clickbait on a fucking news channel.
That Putin guy doesn't care about his own country, just his ego.
So what are the demands? This is no news
We believe in you, Mr Putin.
Putinis just a big bully. He is the greatest liar. Putin promised that Ukraine will not be attacked by Russia when he forced Ukraine to give up its nukes. He didn't keep his promise. Ukraine didn't invade Russia, it was the other way around. Ukraine didn't go to war, it defended its own homeland. Whatever the result of this invasion, the world looks at Pres. ZELENSKY as the better leader than Putin. Zelensky has integrity than Putin. I respect Zelensky than Putin. Ukraine, rise up from your ashes. I believe this country will become a better and greater nation of honest, brave, and determined citizens. My prayer that rebuilding of Ukraine will come sooner, peace and prosperity will reign in this great nation. May God bless, strengthen and protect Pres. ZELENSKY, former pres. PETRO POROSHENKO, and  all the citizens. Amen.🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
no he didn't
here's Some Ironic Hilarious Ad-vice from one Dictator to an Udder one
Like that one general said , just deploy all our subs and let putin know we're ready and we have nukes too.
Anything Putin says is pure subterfuge for further advancement of his goals.
Thanks for news. Should be taking proper solution.
They don't give a s*** about any treaty human rights declaration how about the Geneva Convention treaties Brussels treaty they are all useless pieces of paper United States government can't even uphold the Constitution federal and state courts are nothing but kangaroo dictator Neo-Nazi run agencies and all they have is a bunch of Neo-Nazi agency enforcement so puten  don't waste your time with any of these neo-Nazi
How do they stop fighting when what they're doing is to defend themselves? Is this guy ok?
Invasion they said..?
Why not go over what Moscow's demands are rather than repeating the same info twice?
Sounds reasonable.
Ukraine shouldn’t stop fighting. Putain should surrender himself to Ukraine.
What are the demands
You Mockingbird media Liars or going to prison for lying to people
Here's the real news Russia liberated the Ukraine from the old Nazis Joe Biden's cabal deep state criminal organization and human trafficking and money laundering facilities and schemes. You people need to tell the real truth
Putin and the Russians liberated the Ukraine. It was not an invasion
Ginalit nyo si President Putin kasalanan ng Ukraine actor yan siya ngpalala mgtigil n kyo s mga lies
I didn't get what the title promised, one big dislike for you.
Damn u. Ur demand are unacceptable because u invaded. U really are aout of ur normal Mind.
So basically Putin demands that Ukraine bends over and takes it willingly or the rape continues. I don't know what other analogy would best describe this demand, but Ukraine is being violated in the worst way and without provocation. I'm sure the old Nazi Germany would have also been willing to spare the lives of many civilians had many of the lands they invaded had they allowed the Nazis in and take over without a fight.
A message to President Vladimir Putin and his top officials.I understand you to be a Christian. If this is so Russia’s army must cease fire first. Dear Mr. Putin please hear these words of our Lord and Savior,Jesus Christ does not want us to gather silver & gold in this life. You must follow the teachings and believe that Jesus will save us in the resurrection at end times. A gesture of complete humility will be a necessary step to move forward. Russia should not make demands but only ask for help and aid for Russia and it’s people Be a man of God and all countries will be more than happy to help your people and your economic situation as best we can. As long as your people can make a wage to buy food ,shelter, and clothing this in fact will be the blessing to save your people. Please be the man of God you claim to be. Russia can be great again but not taking from others. Be the leader you were called to be. Stop this invasion of Ukraine,apologize humbly and ask for help. We are all together on this earth. We see Russia’s needs and want to help. I pray that you read this message , I pray  that you follow the footsteps of Jesus .This will lead to true glory for you and your men and most importantly your salvation of your souls. Your blessings will come from what road you choose to travel. Be a wise man ,choose the narrow road. God Bless🙏
Kinda ballsy to set conditions for an end when you’re getting your ass kicked.
Just appeasement all over again, and Putin will get away with these war crimes if they accept his terms.
It is now time to get right with Jesus. nobody is automatically gonna go to heaven at the end of it, we all have lied or stolen or had sex before marriage and the punishment is hell. Jesus died so you can get a clean slate and forgiveness of future sins if you repent of them once you commit them, so you receive the gift of forgiveness by following him. When you start you have to stop sinning, and follow his word and obey it. That’s following Jesus. Read the Bible.
Plz save me  all  peoples
This is bullsh!t. Spring is coming, and Putin is scared shitless. He will be carried out office if this keeps up. Cease fire is wonderful for Ukraine.
WHAT ARE MOSCOWS DEMANDS???
The President of Ukraine is not thinking. And disregarded the side effects of his cold heart. He is sacrificing his people
Putin's days are numbered.
What demands? You've already lost! President Putin, you're an idiot if you think you get to make any demands.
Let's occupy Russia and set our conditions to end an invasion: 1. dictator Putin in Prison 2. Political opponents out of prison 3. free elections in Russia 4. free media 5. give back Crimea and occupied territories in Ukraine 6. peace agreement and no-border-crossing rule 7. payments to repair Ukraine's infrastructure.
How can Ukrain stops fighting first? They are putting up self defence against the invaders,the invaders should should withdraw and stop making demands.
You have to surrender Putin pay all what you've done go down
I dont think Putin is crazy! He have something to achive but the deth and pain is better to stop! People are not ready 4 self ritual sacrfice!
Hey Putin..the people of Ukraine say...get the fk out of our country!! No concessions..go home..you have plenty to take care of in Russia..
Okay we'll  stop trespassing  hurting, and stealing and destroying if you kiss our        a$$.
The big fish always eats the little fish. Today them tomorrow us,at the end of the day I would rather die for my FREEDOM then live as in oppression!!❤
It will be written in history that the Ukrainian tragedy was caused one comedian.  Unfortunately. 😥
This video is a joke
What are the demands. Why would you leave this most important fact out?
How can you trust a snake like Putin!
To end the conflict he started lol. What a twat.
Ukraine should be able starting put paperwork for Gaaga Court on Russians! And bring all world countries to witness!
Why indian are talking too fast ? Calm down .
😂😂😂😂 it's not acceptable!
Putin declare ceasefire coz it's unfair? Countries sending weapons to Ukraine 🤣🤣🤣🤣 that's why 😂 Putin is too smart!
cut the crap Vovan! better run for your life ;)
It’s not conditions of Putin it’s the embarrassment of saying I’ll have control of Ukraine in 2 days , it’s been 2 weeks now… such a cowardly act he did on Ukrainian people…RIP To the children and mothers and fathers and everyone who sacrificed thier lives to fight for thier county…
So what are the conditions? You tell us nothing!
Your kids to your 4th Generation are gonna pay for your sin. Puta
Putin Lucifer… you are jealous on President of President of Ukrainian. You not happy in your house, now you want to take the happiness and love of Ukrainian. Do you have Suger Diabetes that your thing sleeps? So you chose something else to have power over????  No wonder God threw you out of Heaven Lucifer, You can never defeat God
WTF was this
Putin is in no position to be demanding anything
HOPE THESE GLOBALISTS ARE DEALT WITH & THIS THING ENDS!
Tiny tyrant angered
Accepted conditions!!!
If Ukraine care about their people they need to agree  neutualality & recognise  US & NATO are not their allies but only intent on war & antagonizing Russia. Zelenskiy needs free the Dombas regions & let Russia weed out the corruption, Nazi malicia, bio labs & paedophiles.  Ukraine could regain a better status when it's people return.
And the demands are.......?????? Why put a header on this clip like you did and then provide NOTHING?
Great Journalism! What are his demands? You never answered your own headline.
Russia : I WILL START A WAR. Also Russia: COME ON GUYS STOP FIGHTING US.
Soooooooooo what are the demands?!
Meanwhile Turkish made drones flown by the Ukrainians are rackin up 👍🏻🇺🇦😬
The demand for Ukraine to stop attacking, ok Russia.
Thank God
Every problem has the solution, through conversation not war
First of all it’s a war not a invasion!
The third world war begins. Russia must pay!
Haven’t  you learnt yet . He gets a little then pushes for more. He’s broke push back, 18000 fighters have arrived to bolster Ukraine
Moscow's demands? And what are Moscow's demands?
Putin was about to fist bump the Turkish president but the Turks wasn't having it. "People are dying dude, inappropes". 🤣🤣🤣
Ukraine stop fighting?   You invaded them
NATO fell into the trap of the Russian bear and the Chinese dragon
ANYBODY TELL ME THIS IS TRUE  THE NIGHTMARE IS OVER
So Ukraine has to stop fighting first...thats another way of saying surrender..
Путин
Putin : let's fist pump Erdogan : nah
Please everyone you all need to think out of box instead of being distracted what the media say and show you all.   They will never tell you the truth.
Ukraine 🇺🇦 leader is taking order from his so call leader WEF so call Klaus.  The puppet Ukraine president is only taking orders and all leaders do.   Another staged war created by so call corrupt leaders.
Where’s Joe Biden in all this? Lost in the White House restroom?? This is embarrassing for the United States as a leader of the free world. Putin listens to Erdogan and just spits on Biden. Ridiculous, Trump would of had Putin begging for forgiveness.
So basically Russia's demands are the equivalent of surrender and let us eat your children. That's how all his bordering nations see it. This will only end when either side finds a sane set of demands. I don't think Russia will survive this long term. It will break up further.
Wion: Russia sets new conditions to end fighting  New Conditions: Old Conditions  I feel like I entered a room full of apes by clicking on this video.
Wow.... This just in: Vladimir Putin have eaten food and drank water. The food he ate was eaten by him and so was too the water in which Putin used to quench his thirst.   This video useless
This  U N . Talking humanity , the crisis, women & children , food, water, refugee prob. U N ! According to them wt about the same situation in Lebonon, Iraq Libiya Vietnam Afghanistan Sudan Panama Syria Ugoslaviya where ever U S intervened .?
america killed millions in afghanistan and iraq. america operates like Hitler did. Because hey own the economy nobody has the balls too say a word too them.
What conditions????
This is also his plan from the very beginning, an old school strategy.
How can Ukraine stop fighting against Russia if they are in their homeland fighting with them. To cease fighting Russian military must leave Ukraine....
Works for me.
Thank you for info,actually I was surprised when the war began, countries that claims to be humanitarian, didn't  focus in rescuing Ukraine but focus only in thier personal interest by snooping some and planning to begin war games with them,So this senseless war must be stopped this is like a wrestling tournament with a bet for thier favorites.This war  didn't happens if Ukraine ,thier leader was been accused of some issues against humanity.
Accept it already ukraine
Thanks God, everything getting fine
Ukraine should take Russia. Those people need to be liberated. Where is China to help Ukraine? Pla, let's liberate Russia from its dictators.
What a bloody lunatic
The only thing I got from this is Putin will stop the invasion if Ukraine stops fighting back that's like someone who started a fight with you saying "stop punching me and i'll stop punching you in the face"
why are all indian newsreaders so shrill
Bully attacks victim. Victim fights back. Bully sees if he carries on fighting both will suffer terribly. Bully tells victim to stop fighting. Victim says no. That's the gist of where we're at.
They’re not “Sanctions” they’re special economic conditions.
Thank you for saying nothing
What are his demands? Not mentioned at all.
This would never happen if sheep soldiers would stop listening to their leaders. Putin alone can’t do anything without soldiers. Is up to us
for the past few years, I've come to Wion for trusted news, I have been left pretty disappointed with the reporting on this conflict.
LET US PRAY SO THAT PUTIN CAN HAVE MERCY OVER UKRAINE
Godbless
So 5.4 Million People viewed this to understand what the conditions/demands are?
He's a proven LIAR he won't stop until he's TOOK Ukraine !! Putin's hate goes deep even to the Extent of hurting HIS OWN PEOPLE He's Russia's Dictator Not The Worlds , He's committed so many Crimes there s no way back YOU COUKD NEVER TRUST HIM AGAIN !!
The parisite is mentally unstable, he may not know it but he has already lost this war, without money or trade with any other country Russia is doomed.
What kind of demands??? If a thief try to come in to your house, he could demands you what to do to assaults???? What kind of joke is this???!!!!
Why don't the Ukrainian refugees go to Russia will be safer there 🤷‍♂️
Putin needs to leave Ukraine immediately and pay to rebuild!😲😲😲
bio labs?????????
Stop calling him a president . He is a dictator . He is no different then Hitler .
the only peace will be the disappearance of Putin by his own people who he is obviously scared of
Erdogan seems good than Biden
Wtf they talking about this is the 22nd century thia mother is a war criminal and should be handled accordingly as a terrorist for how many innocent lives he has taken
Готовы к ядерной зиме? Русские готовы, и так измучены 30 лет!!! Европу предупреждали об этом или ваш оператор не выдавал такого прогноза? Вам капут ;-) Are you ready for nuclear winter? The Russians are ready, and so exhausted for 30 years!!! Was Europe warned about this or did your operator not issue such a forecast? You kaput ;-)
Go turkey! lets hope something comes out of it.
Well what are the demands? You said the same thing over for  2 minutes. People actually watch your no news station? What happened to journalist work where you gather all the information before you put it on the air?
To the Russian soldiers, once your out of Russian borders you always have the option to renounce your leader and turn your weapons in and surrender. And the war crimes Putin had already committed would be reason enough to join up with the Ukrainians and demand he brought to the world tribunal for his acts against humanity. Become heros to Russia not criminals for Putin!!
Russia attacked Ukraine not vice versa. It's war Giant Goliath attacking Small man David .
Russian President Vladimir Putin sets conditions to end Moscow's invasion in Ukraine. :D
Cut Russia off completely.
I am shocked that everyone here failed to say that Putin is a criminal
Only thing Putin about to end is Russia.
Give It to a man to have war.... For god's sake stop this BS. They should all be fired no more politicians and presidents or queens let people live in peace
5 days and the most strong and attacking language plus sanctions against Putin, 70 years of Israel: occupation, annexation, ethnic cleansing, illegal settlements, Gaza bombings. The world is hypocrite...
Just me or did Puting go for a brofist with Turkish president? Respect!
People have short memorys
lies, he won't stop
What are the demands?
Is the Russian "nuclear arsenal" even operational.
Putin laid off demands  that will prevent Ukrainian killing Ukrainian as they were doing at least for the last 8 years in Donbas.
So the Devending country must stop fighting back.. I guess this method is part of the new normal
We gotta hold Putin and his people responsible even if the people are not in the know or are scared to uprise 100%.. they cannot lock up every person in russia who complains….russia will have to be put on the dummy.. until they rebuilt every building that Putins men took down..and i say..war crimes arrest warrants on Putin and a huge reward for his head
F×ck putins demands. Pres Zelensky should be making the demands
WARS AND RUMORS OF WAR😏
I say , " We told Hitler to go swimming in a lake in hell , as Kada
Collapse his economy, nuff said!
More proof politicians should be the ones fighting 1vs1, not them telling their populace to die for their desires.
You mean he’s losing and wants to save face
Espero que si termine y termine bien y que cada uno se valla para su casita tranquilitos lo demas con el tiempo se cura, y las muertes muy triste, pero lucharon con valor tenas orgullo ucrania, la guerra se termina pronto se retira espero que el presidente de Ucrania este dispuesto aseptara la paz  y reconstruir a Ucrania y a su pueblo, solo espero que todo sea cierto.
You started World War lll but that's Ok cuz it's good for America's economy, all wars are good money makers sad but true but now I'm gonna face 18 years in prison cuz I said, "Putin started World War lll" You're Off Your Rockers Putin. You don't know if you love or hate Hitler. War, War, War, cuz of you Putin.Ur Crazy
Pues eso esta muy bien 👌
Lol regarding the comment "demands are".. Gotta shine my  shoes Ukraine and here's the list wich is bigger then the encyclopedia library... Ukraine isn't giving up,:) American citizens are volunteering for " fun"... 4 fun, that's crazy cool in all reality, you could get $$$Money if you did just by writing a book n making a documentary.... You would have tons of support by the locals but don't get caught by the Russians with evidence of your actions, just act like a journalist n only carry gun when Russians can't see you n then hand it over to a Soldier when you walk.. They need to hit n run, hit n run,hit n run, drive the Russians nuts if they "can't" ever see their enemies like the Viet Cong did to the Americans. Thousands of Snipers...;) They got this one.. Don't Give Up Ukraine, You Will Win!!!;)Then train Hawks to take out Russian hand held drones and have the sky littered with Ukraine hand held drones when the Hawk is put away but Ya, that's what we need to buy them is hand held drones....  Putin isn't gonna stop, ☮️ peace means drop more bombs to create ☮️ peace...
This is like those ads you get that say they are going to tell you how to lose weight without changing your diet, but not until they show someone giving praising reviews to whatever it is that are trying to tell you how to do it
i dont see why russia cant become a part of the european union as a sovereign nation...
Pues ya que deje de atacar
Why are dictators and their families always rich? Even at this moment when so many people are dying...
Love and support from India to our best friend 🇷🇺 Russia ❤
Putin wants Ukraine to stop fighting. Of course he does. Then he can invade without opposition. How about this, Puty? Pull your fucking troops out and Ukraine will stop fighting.
Conditions of a bully and aggressor.
Can someone tell me what those conditions are????
Putin sir, destroy all western countries, India is with you.
Unsubscribed
Don't let this communist  keeler  he can not be president called
What other conditions??
I hope the Ukrainian citizens and army destroy the invading Russians ! Moscow will not be in a position to demand anything from the Ukraine or anyone else for that matter!
Putin is looking for way to get out lost 2 Generals
Bellas orquideas 😍❤
I understand now why this video doesn't have alot of likes, because most of them are dislikes.
Putin: Condition 1) Surrender and give me All of Ukraine. Condition 2) disband  NATO. Condition 3) Also give me the rest of Eastern Europe.
Pretty stupid to compare this conflict to WWII...
WAG KA NANG MAGBIGAY NG CONDITION NALALAPIT NA ANG ARAW NA IYONG PAGBAGSAK NAGAAKLAS NA ANG IYONG NASASAKUPAN IKAW ANG NAGSIMULA NG GULONG ITO.
We do not know what exactly are the demands of President Putin.  Let's pray that President Zelensky decide to finally surrender and stop fighting for THE SAKE OF HIS PEOPLE who are terribly affected by the war.  UKRAINE SHOULD FIRMLY DECIDE NOT TO APPLY FOR NATO MEMBERSHIP.  NATO is creating wars among the nations through its assumed role as the "watchdog" of the nations.  This is not true.  NATO'S MAIN PURPOSE is global domination through its oligarchs.  President TRUMP and PUTIN are the ones blocking the ungodly GLOBAL RESET of the New World Order.  Let us not be deceived.  If you will notice, the globalists cheated President TRUMP from being reelected and now they want to REMOVE President PUTIN so that there will be no more obstacles to their ungodly goals.  Ukraine's President Zelensky and President Biden are simply pawns to the furtherance of the Global Reset.
Bravo Chechnya n Rusia n Belarusia.. God bless you all
Its 3 conditions. 1. Accept Russian ownership of Crimea  2. Independence of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions 3. Rewriting of their constitution barring any NATO or EU membership.
Putin conditions are all about him. It is all one sided for putin
Sounds great !!
Seems has no heart at all Sent innocent children army  to be killed N killing innocent children people,, How can they trusted him again God is watching,,,why on earth destroying peoples life took everything from them,, It’s own people are rallying on the street,,, There is no FOREVER IN THIS WORLD NO MATTER WHAT YOU HAVE IS ALL NOTHING,, YOU COME OUT IN THIS WORLD WITH NOTHING YOU GO WITH NOTHING,,,,,  THE MAIN THING IS WHEN U GO PEOPLE REMEMBER YOU WITH GOOD MEMORRIES  NOT JUST LIKE UR ALREADY IN GRAVE PEOPLE SPEDDING SWEARING AT YOU,,, THERE IS NO SUCH A WORDS OF FORGIVENESS OR FORGET CZ ITS HAPPENED,,
What is going on at the Space Station?
LANGET MANMANW  Putin
We will declare conditions! Not Putin!
The condition is we accept no condition but russias surrender
shove his demands up his /////
Wannabe bullshit trying hard news agency. Click bait!
Just get those UN BASTARDS AT ANY Cost! Wipe them all off the planet!
Go Putin! Let's go Brandon!
Putin ina mo ( son of a beach) sounds like.
what ARE THOSE dEMANDS? faCTS pLEASE
wtf
So if Ukraine stops fighting? So you can slaughter them all and get what you want? I’m sorry,that would be like an intruder comes in my house and demands me to stop fighting,then he will leave. Why don’t he call a cease fire, and go back to his country!
Putin could be a hero, if he decides to value his reputation and find a peaceful solution for a FREE UKRAINE.
Ridiculous
Cant believe putin,can,t negotiate, dealing with a  mentally challenge control friek.
I wouldn't believe ANYTHING that comes out of Putins mouth. Chances are he will have you shot like fish in a barrel and what the feck are these demands?
I look at it this way. If Ukraine wants to join NATO for added protection from all of the other nut balls out here, then Ukraine has every god giving right to do so. Who is Russia to determine wether or not if its ok for Ukraine to join NATO? I am pretty sure there are people here in the US who have family or friend's who live in ukraine. I mean what is the big Fkg deal if Ukraine joins NATO? So what. I say let them join, be free and a peaceful country. That's all Ukraine wants is to be free, not controlled by a dictator or being ruled over like Putin is a freaking king or something. Let Ukraine voices be spoken and heard, not in silence or fear!
Setting conditions due to severe ass whoopin and bruiser ego
It will end when the antichrist comes on the scene. EVERYBODY accept yahuah sevuoth and his son yahusha hamashiac into your life and you will be saved.
What the hell did I just watch
Oh ok yup. Sure we will just all act like nothing happened is that the message coming across now ? That dude is more screwed up than Obiden .
Useless news… more like click bate
What are the conditions? You keep saying the same time useless info
STOP PUTIN..... BOMB MOSCOW
What are Russia's demands?
My advice to the Russian Generals: Arrest the madman Putin, put him in a lunatic asylum and end this unjust war.
Glory to Ukraine
This micro end of the world war, will be over soon but you’ll be ripped off at the gas pump (just in time for summer) and grocery store. Same ole same ole…
Putin is a idiot. Get him out of power any way necessary.
The only way the war will stop Is when Russia surrender  Putin words mean nothing
What conditions? They want the bioweapons labs moved from the Russian border...correct? I am not a Putin fan but if Russia parked several bioweapons labs on our border I would think there would be a response...correct?
What were the Putin demands🤔?
So hey, let's talk about the Biden family's ties to Ukraine eh? Right, that never existed, dumb conspiracy stuff.
Ok wtf are the conditions.....
Poutine nage dans le gris .De quelle droit peut-il envahir un pays .des millers de personnes meurent .Aucune excuse ,c'est un assasin .dommage pour le peuple russe.
Viva RUSSIA
Yeah yo just give the man what he wants, I’m over this Russia Vs Ukraine shit we’re having a hard enough time to defeat Covid let alone a whole damn war. And then we gotta get the gas prices lower again. PUT TRUMP BACK IN OFFICE. Many a people wanted to impeach trump why can’t we impeach Biden
vladimir you will be held accountable. Long live Ukraine and all who stand for freedom.
No conditions, just take your ass's back home and try to straighten up your own country!!!
Putler setting conditions… we can’t negotiate with delinquents. He should get into jail.
Conditions: stop genocide, go home, pay for damages.
Watch your butt, you do not want to mess with the united States. They will take you out...
kcuF this clown
CCP will pay for what it induce.
Putins demands stop kicking our ass Ukraine
Russia getting it's ass kicked lol 😂
PUTIN needs to be arrested and tried in the international tribunal , so many of Russian soldiers died for his unnecessary war.
What are the demands you 😫
So their "condition" is unconditional surrender.
This lady probably got off set and got a bottol o  wotta
Exactly what's the point of this click bait channel ? What demands did Putin make, I think I will ask Google.
Well, Putin is on gaining a country and at the same time advancing his interst in the Middle East. The democrats fail on both!
OK, so lets end a war we can't win anyway.   Do what Putin ask.  Not worth any more deaths.
Well what are the demands...??? Terrible news cycle...😳
.... And those demands are???  Thats the whole reason I clicked this video.  x_x
A Dictator/Tyrant/Despot imposing his Whims and Caprices on a Democratic Country!!!!!
Ukraine is fighting for the world! They win and we win and Putin is gone! They lose and were screwed and will have to fight Putin someday on NATO soil and NATO blood will be shed! We have to support 110%, if we do they might kick Goliaths ass! God bless Ukraine!
One of the demands was Putin went interview with her 🔥
If we were getting oil from ukrain this war would have already been over!
Just wants Ukraine to halt their efforts to make it easier to get in further
One doesn’t experience self transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates~ 🎈
it is a war that is all it is lol
"Peace is not merely the absence of war but the presence of justice, of law, of order —in short, of government." ― Albert Einstein    (United Federation of Nations)
We in USA have answer, stop buying products from Russia and shut all exports to russia. I'm willing to do with out to help fight for Ukrainians. Putin is a murderer and may he reap from the Lord of heaven what he has sown. May he receive a seven fold increase from the seed he has sown.
What if India/others; could: "organise/arrange, for Peace (and become: the heroes); **whilst remaining: NEUTRAL!!"**?? -M.K.S. India/Turkey -etc./ASIA: Can!! -M.K.S.
WHAT ARE THE DEMANDS
The conditions are that Ukraine surrender and lose everything, just hand it all over to Man Vlad and he will stop killing them and his own.
Putin is obviously homophobic, he pretests too much.  Its time he confronted his inner deamonds and came out of the closet.  PLEASE VLADIMIR release the tension and come out.  Nobody cares about you riding horses without a shirt, but please let everyone get on with their lives and stop bombing inocent people.  Also PLEASE do not forget you country's place in the Eurovision Song Contest depends upon your immediate action!!!  Vladimir, I know the song contest is close to your heart, but think of the ordinary straight people as well.  Turn your tanks around and we will vote for you on Ru Paull's...  Love from Salisbury, you C**T
strange how one man can have absolute power in a developed country this day and age.
They come for you now, Putin.
…, the only think dictators understand is when rockets are coming at them.
"Russia will only halt its military operation if Ukraine stops fighting ...".  It sounds like Putin wants Ukraine to surrender.  What!!
ABC’s of being saved Admit you are a sinner……………. Romans 3:23  For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God; 1 John 1:19 “If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. Believe Jesus is Lord…………….  Romans 10:9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. 10 For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.

that beady eyed liar.
PUTIN MUST BE A DEMOCRAT BECAUSE THEY DEMAND SHIT LIKE HE IS "PUTIN" IS ONE MORE  PLACE IN A SERIES OF BULLSHIT THAT HE HAS NEVER DONE ANYTHING WRONG, BUT THE FACT IS HE IS A BIG LIER JUST LIKE JOE BIDEN AND HIS FRIENDS ARE JUST LIKE THEY ALL ARE,  DEMOCRATS HAVE BEEN FIGHTING ABOUT THEIR OWN PROBLEMS WITH EACH OTHER, MR,TRUMP IS THE ONLY ONE THAT CAN MAKE THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA 🇺🇸 THE WAY IT SHOULD BE.
It is not a conflict, it is an invasion of a sovereign country by a dictator!
Shove your demands up your agenda, Vladdy.
Thanks for telling us what the demands are. We now know more than 5 mins ago
so he will stop the war if Ukraine hand him their country.I feel a Snake  Island response coming on.This is UKRAINE
Yes, the conditions… All frozen Russian funds should be seized and be repaid to Ukraine as restoration after the invasion is defeated.
All Russian troops must lay down their arms,abandon all vehicles & walk back to Russia. The weapons & vehicles belong to Ukraine now. Personnel suspected of war crimes have 48 hours to turn themselves in to Ukrainian military Officers.
He destroys Ukraine and the Russian economy; kids and old Ladies murdered.  Now his billions are being taken; that hurts.  He has real enemies now and a war criminal.
These are conditions of surrender.
President Putin The Angel of death is going to put Santions on You for doing His Job!!!!
In other words, Putin says do exactly as I say or invasion will continue!  What an evil narcissist!
When does the loser dictate the conditions?
The Ukrainian leader will be very sorry, once Russians objectives are achieved. You can not kill Russian people in the Donbass and Luhansk regions for eight years and expect Russia to do nothing. The west is equally responsible for pushing nato further and further east and provoking Russia. No lectures from UK who had a British empire who enslaved many countries by conquest and America, which was stolen from the native Indians.
Stop dreaming. Comrade Biden send Blinken and Milley to Poland in order to coerce Zelensky to accept the humiliating terms from Putin. Zelensky will not seek membership of NATO, and concede the eastern territories. In order words, what Putin cannot rob by force. Biden obtained for him by stabbing the free people of Ukraine in the back.
This woman is not a  very good reporter. You would think she would also be reporting on the specifics of Putin's demands, but no, not a one.
Russia could End the Conflict with just one Nuke thrown at Ukraine.. USA does it all the Time to other Nations.
Did she say Ukraine should stop fighting while the whole country is under attack? Please enlighten my ignorance.
Vladimir is doing am awesome job in the ukraine
Outrageous. Putin wants them to surrender amid HIS illegal; and uncalled for, invasion of another sovereign country and the deliberate murder of their people. It’s disgusting.  I hope Ukraine can hold on long enough for the rich people that actually pull the strings in Russia, to finally get their pockets hurt enough that they force Putin out of office.
We all knew Ukraine love the supports having from NATO led by United States, No way Ukraine going to Stop Fighting & they cave-in to Russia Depend AGAIN No U.S. allow that.
i used to have a little respect for Putin. after seeing women and children being killed with cluster bombs, he is a P.O.S. !
After listening to this .. For Ukraine to stop fighting is like they are waving the white flag to say we surrender. For Putin to take control Quickly. If Putin was for real he would order his men out of Ukraine .  I support what the Ukrainians are doing . it reminds me of what my for fathers faught for to keep the British from taking over our Country . the United States of America.
So now you have to negotiate with Putin in order for him to not invade your country? Which country will be next that will need to "negotiate"? Someone there should eliminate this madman before "someone else" decides to just nuke him and get this over with!
So this video was just telling us: putin will only stop the invasion if ukraine lets russia do whatever they want. And this was worth anyone's time why? (Perfect example of why youtube should bring back visible dislikes because then people could look at the dislikes I imagine this video has for repeating the same sentence for almost 2 minutes and not providing any new or useful information and know that they should just keep scrolling.)
"let's tell you about them now". proceeds to tell jack shit. proper news.
So his demands were to stop fighting😂seems reasonable 🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦
That's it hurt russia in any financial way and let the Russians starve and Migrate to different nations so Putin and his crappy regime can fall
What are the demands?!!!!!!!!!
LETS GOOOO RUSSIA 🇷🇺  !!!!!!!!!!
Putin pulled the same crap with the civilian population of Ukraine and them systematically destroyed many of them IN COLD BLOOD. Watch your back Indians because the Pakistanis are coming for you!!
Well now I know exactly what the conditions for peace are!
Putin hasn't conceded to any humanitarian solution to stop the war.  He wants a Russian Ukraine period.
Russia is fast becoming the 8th wonder of the world. " The only hole above ground." Time for the down trodden Russian people to bin this poisonous dwarf.
Myanmar
I still love that people called it a "special military operation" when it's clearly a war. Bullying smaller countries doesn't mean it's less important than if two big countries went to war.
Putin does not like my song "Bullet (Single with Mark Zonder.. Putin is attacking my computers and phones.  My band Psycho Echo think they are attacking my band as well.  This is messed up.  The song “Bullet” for Putin!!!
Glaive
Putin demands Ukraine stop plotting with the west to destroy Russia. Ukraine can joint NATO when NATO disbands. ....from Ireland.
Russia brought in the secret weapon... Brittany Griner... LoL
If America kept its nose out of other countries business that would be the start of peace. If Europe focused on its own problems sending so many weapons when so many are on the poverty line anf rely on food banks for their next meal. What twisted governments we have
Жиза
SLAVA UKRAINE 🇺🇦🙏🏻🇺🇦🙏🏻🇺🇦
Fluff him
Stop fighting means, surrender and give me your country. So there. The dick-tator has spoken, LOL
Why he didn't wait for 2030 agenda??!!
To  Mr Putin :-    "It is better to conquer yourself , conquer peace within yourself than to win a thousand battles. Then the victory is yours. It cannot be taken from you, not by angels or by demons, heaven or hell." —  Lord Buddha  Siddharth Gautham
This is click bait...."sets conditions" Those conditions being explained about six times over and over is that Russia's conditions are to accept our demands. Thanks....great news.
shame on Turkey and Ukraine.
We all know what happens to those who fix their heads to be hard,Mr,pharao was there,but God proved him wrong and delivered the Israelites,so Ukrainian s she continue to pray and wait the hand of the lord,their salvation is near
I believe that all shall be well in Jesus Christ name,the war will come to an end since night can be full of sorrow but finally morning will come out beautiful and joyous
I believe that all shall be well in Jesus Christ name,the war will come to an end since night can be full of sorrow but finally morning will come out beautiful and joyous
Putin is a murderer ! 👎
No thanks Putin, the rest of the world has already agreed to its own conditions. You’re FUCKED!!
We may be watching WWIII in it's infancy!.
Putin  will burn in Hell
Well, precisely.   No problem.  Clear, concise, and utterly reasonable.
Putin is a coward and a rat. Attacking weaker county... What a hero... What a warrior! Typical, russian move. That idiot have no idea how to take care of his own people and now he's invading others
Bloodimir Putin.....😩
Hahahaha his men are fcking up big time he isn't in a position to make demands
Because even the Russsn soldiers don’t want to fight, but they have to because they don’t want to die”   It’s it’s a sad reality when you forced to kill people or you’ll be killed   It’s like survival,   It’s like your suck in a bottomless hole you can’t escape from,     What do I do now?   Do I kill these people or let myself die?   I can’t let myself die but I don’t want to hurt anyone else either, so I have to kill these innocent people, and I don’t know why!!!!   It’s a survival mode,
😭😭😭😭
Putin...You have to teach the west a lesson...
All this mess is the result of an american trick
The whole oppressed world today loves putin, because this conflict shows that the world peace agency is a hypocrite..all the oppressed people hate America so much,!!!!
Someone has got yo tell this Vladimir “ I’m not going to kill any more people, you can do what the hell you want with me I’m never going to hurt anyone anymore, that’s that”
It’ll make things soooo much better, it just doesn’t make sence to use violence to solve issues,
His 7th demand Is completely unacceptable.
Why can’t people settle things with a dance battle
The passage of time will make it clear to even the more slow among us that the government is the foremost threat to life and liberty
🇷🇺+🇧🇾+🇺🇦=brother. Всем привет с Украины...
What were the conditions? Shit news report.
普京加油啊
You have mot mentioned what are those demands by Moscou for cease fire. We need to know and see if Russia, USA and UK can keep their words.
The Ukrainians, didn’t start this war,Putin did. And the Ukrainians are fighting for their lives, and they need all the help they can get. Also, what Putin says he lies to get what he wants. The whole world needs to be very careful of Putin.
Putin go to the hel
This man think he's God he needs that smirk taken off his face
The demands are just repeating that Putin has demands over and over again. Ha! They thought they could trick us. We have it all figured out folks
What are the Fucking Demands ???????
Russia is using mercenaries in Ukraine so the west must retaliate with mercenaries of their own and armed with both air and ground missiles.
Putin is scared to death of American fighter jets and weapons.  His entire army and airforce would be decimated in days.
British journalist Richard Medhurst: "Ukraine has exposed Western hypocrisy and racism."
😘Thanks editor for Cutting video in Half .......Completely excluding "what are  those sections "  part 👍   Suspenseful ending
Why dont you tell us his demands ??
Dankoni vin, tre informa video.Mi ĝojos se ankaŭ vi venos al mia kanalo.
Poootin terrible accent 😆
He is not in a position to dictate anything!! He is not really winning! He is a War Criminal! Rg 79549
get rid of hilter the second scum bag
Vladimir Putin i am appealing to you please bring an end to the war in Ukraine now so that the people of Ukraine can live in peace in harmony
Ordegon lost my respect, as a Muslim, we shouldn’t be In their business as they also ignore Muslims countries. This scum-backs never care about us, why we have to.
WTF
Ukraine to stop fighting and surrender?  Moscow condition: Surrender?  What’s left for discussion🙏
The world is not Russia and its inhabitants, like many Russian want liberty. You are a prehistoric figure that wants to change reality. In spite of your war and your cruelty you have failed. Stop while you can, you might loose like all dictators power and your life! Stop killing!
Ukraine can take  Crimea back  .
Shame on u. None of moscow's demands are reported here.
No no don't worry about it we'll make the conditions Putin just kick back see ya soon
Putin also promised Ukraine it’s sovereignty if they handed over their nuclear weapons (the Budapest Memorandum).  Needless to say his words are not to be trusted.
Russia declares war on Ukraine.  Sets conditions to end the war as “Stop defending yourself.” 🤔
They’re not “Sanctions” they’re special economic conditions.
What is the condition for cease fire?
It’s crazy they are purposely not giving the demands of Russia. Everyone go do you research don’t fall for the media’s tricks
Long live
_Thank you President Putin for your attack on the enemy, Gaddafi would be proud of you_
Good jobs Russia 😄👍👍👍👍
That kinda sounds like he is not going to quit.........
My god this man is pathetic. He's got all that military might, he is living in 2022, he is the president of the most geographically large country on planet Earth, he's got the largest nuclear arsenal, he's insanely wealthy and...he's so scared of a tiny country like Ukraine being a part of NATO that he feels the need to lash out at them killing civilians, ruining buildings and ordering his own people to die fighting people who did them no harm.
India always support you man.... Putin is a great man... Good work.... Jai bharat.. Jai 🇷🇺🇷🇺🍺🍺🍺🇮🇳🇮🇳..   Luv you russia
Russia: You stop fighting and we will end the invasion *Ukraine stops fighting* Russia: COooOll guys now we can really invade!!
Turkey is a puppet of USA, putin wont listen, any NATO country is USA puppet, nato countries statements wont mean anything to putin.
Zelensky say this, Zelensky say that, Zelensky is defending democracy, Hi's defending people rights, hi i s defending hi is defending... The truth is hi is defending his own ass. Surrounded in NATO bunker, hi has to show his  actresses acting skills to satisfy his bosses!
Слава русскому народу!!!
what a useless report
The demands require Putin to own the world.
He also wants a young and beautiful Ukranian lady next to him and that's all, nothing else, he almost ask for nothing, very humble this petit demon.
please stop the war, don't be selfish, many children have lost their parents and families
STOP the assassination of Ukraine's civilian population and respect Ukraine as an independent state with the right to make its own choices. Potin you are a simple killer of civilians. Get out of Ukraine NOW. Think about the consequences this will have for the Russian people. Google translates from Norwegian ОСТАНОВИТЕ убийства мирного населения Украины и уважайте Украину как независимое государство, имеющее право делать собственный выбор. Потин ты простой убийца мирных жителей. Уезжайте из Украины СЕЙЧАС. Подумайте, какие последствия это будет иметь для русского народа. Гугл переводит с норвежского
Pantaskah kecamuk perang tiada tanda diplomasi yg it lbh baik&cerdas dbanding pencet tombol senjata yg semua orang pasti bisa???perang kecerdasan otak hanya bisa dlakukan manusia tertentu saja,knp Allah mengharamkan perang dbulan2tertentu???apa bisa mereka melaksanakan puasa &idul fitri padahal sebentar lagi???alasan apa lagi selain gedung2 yg sudah tua atau gatel dengan iptek???tidakkah takut dengan azab Alloh melanggar  bulan yg Alloh haramkan demikian juga diterimanya do'a rakyat kecil yang tertindas??
Putin crazy
What the hell….
Things people do to be “immortalized” in history
Why would Ukraine give in to Putin's demands ? Putin is on the ropes getting a hiding right now from the Homeland and the World as well as in Ukraine. Keep up the pressure a KO is not far away.
I can't believe turkey is doing the job of America   So much shame on Joe bifrog 😐😐🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️
This is the most awful attempt at news lmao India just can’t get it right
Conditions? Really? Ka bogo jud nimo putin senseless animal.
grow some balls ans john help NATO  and use marine and air force and navy No _ fly zone ukraine's
The leaders of western Europe and the United States are busy imposing sanctions on Russia. simply because Russia invaded Ukraine with the aim of protecting its country from the nato threat. hey you leaders of western europe and america. why don't you give the same sanctions to Israel, even though it is clear that Israel often commits crimes against humanity against Palestine? Then what about the United States which attacked Iraq and Afghanistan which caused many casualties. Why was America not given sanctions as well? if you want to uphold justice don't be picky remember the whole world is watching your actions.
Лицо российского президента Путиниши рычит, как бешеная собака, посреди миллиона борцов за свободу, прибывших в Украину, чтобы убивать российских солдат.
Ok Ukraine agree
Urrraaaaa...🇷🇺
World must put a Bounty of Putin's head! All the Terrorist will go after him!
The real winner is the *"weapons manufacturers in the US"*
Russia will invade countries/Ukraine unless it gets what he wants. .....Yes lets let it happen, gr8 message 4the world, no?
Jesus loves you he died on the cross for your sins. All you have to do is believe in him and you will be saved. ❤
We need Seal Team 6. Putin should go visit Osama Bin Laden.
What ARE Putin's demands beyond Ukrainians laying down their arms? Surrender? That's the only option? Some things need to be spelled out - and I do not understand what's not being said. What are his exact demands?
The entire war could have been avoided if Ukraine chose to remain neutral from the start...
'Let's tell you again'
Fuckin click bait
They refuse to tell it because they are easy and quite logical if the West weren't evil. If they were irrealistic, would they skip the conditions?
He has no rights to dictate terms he is a war criminal
Modi and Putin  will bring peace to the world
Putin pls stop this war
Dude went in for a fist bump lol
Wish the war end soon. God bless these two countries.
and when we entered Ukraine, we saw 30 laboratories and the preparation of dirty bombs, and soon the documents will be published.  They ran quickly and failed to destroy everything.  And how much money has America invested in Ukraine and why?
Can some billionaire buy these old MiGs from Poland and gift them to Ukraine. ITs private business
Putin in no position to set any demands. He invaded sovereign state of Ukraine, much like Hitler invaded Poland on September 1, 1939. He is aggressor and war criminal who effectively forfeited all his rights and will be prosecuted for his heinous crime in due time. Unless, much like Hitler, he will commit suicide before he'll be seized.
Grande Putin continua così fino in fondo poi chiudi subito il gas e gasolio
God dam finally
Putin has always been a giant a hole, but at least he used to be very smart. What he is doing now is just insane and fruitless. What he is achieving is creating hatred between Ukraine and Russia, a hatred that will last for generations. He can't just annex another sovereign country, didn't work for Hitler and it won't work for him.
I feel like they should agree to remain neutral, recognise the 2 states of dunestk and Luhansk. Let that have Crimea and stop the war. What’s the alternative? If you don’t then they will end up with nothing. Awful situation but surely you would want to remain as Ukraine (albeit a marginally smaller one) with your own civilians in tact.
this is a rubbish channel, feels like click-bait
I don’t see how they can just “stop” the war it’s gone to far to stop now it will just escalate even further
Wow until demands are met just like the mustache man that was after Poland
Cease Fire and  Peace can happen
Ordogan is disrespecteted really😅😆😆😆😫
If Ukraine stops fighting first, that means Ukraine must surrender to Russia and then do whatever they say, which is who knows what.
Mr Putin  the best.
Thanks for explaining what the demands are
Please stop war. Let innocent people live ❤️
PUTIN ASKED SEVERAL TIMES NICELY TO NATO NOT TO EXPAND, NOW HERE HE TEACH A LESSON TO NATO AND READY FOR MOSCOW DEMANDS. PUTIN IS DOING THE RIGHT THING IN MY POINT OF VIEW.
"Stop fighting so we can conquer you already."
Men become animals and eat their victims. I drink your blood and I eat your skin. A young boy infects an entire town with rabies. And turns a group of men into a band of bloodthirsty zombies ravaging a peaceful country side. I drink your blood and I eat your skin.  Infected, rabid flesh Revenge for, acid death Frothed-death rage Tortured-Flesh crave Hippie crazed cult Rabid bloodshed Massacred Chopped and hacked Mass bloodshed Rabid death  -Mortician
why is all the communist countries who call themselves liberators of people. First become capitalist and then as of now dictators of their on country. With out even the freedom of speech for citizens. And in moral they blame the capitalist even now. Where there is all the freedom to public. Why? any answers?
Loss of data
Why this news video becomes a hit without providing ANY INFO on what are the conditions is one of the greatest mystery.
Hey Pres Putin, I overheard that Foreign fighters volunteering to join Ukraine army who are  known for their combant skills/ experiences in their country in the south and in the north are otw to fight alongside Ukraine. OMG,  these combatants fighters are well trained SNIPERS, CHAMPIONS, GOLD MEDALIST..., THEY have lived in the mountains and are well trained in war.... Russia must watch out!
Putin gebe mir den scheiß Knopf für Atom Bomben ich drücke den für dich liebend gerne ich habe nichtz zu verlieren außer mein beschissenes Leben und ich scheiß auf dieses scheiß leben was ich habe und ausserdem wenn Hälfte von scheiß Planet Dreck abkratzen tut geht denn scheiß Planet Dreck ein wenig besser.
And??
Ukraine should go Neutral and kick out  warmongers NATO & USA for the sake of saving civilian Ukrainen lives!!
কত্ত
In den Augen des Heiligen Gottes ist Putin nichts anderes als nur ein brutaler Massenmörder !!! 👹👹👹666👹👹👹
This is good. Of course, those NATO Nazi’s don’t like that.USA Nazi’s in government want war. I think Biden and his NATO cronies are committing war crimes on humanity.
my highest respect to journalists who put themselves in literal war zones everyday to report, knowing they're also in the line of fire & that nobody is safe in war. glad they're okay because that was terrifying
If Ukraine, another words, just stops fighting and Give In to Russia and surrender to them And to his demands, or else... So much for negotiation. He still holds the cards, for now.
COWARDLY
Putin Russia, Ukraine will never stop fighting, Ukraine will kill every last one of your goofy general,  putin Russia, y'all will die in the urban area of war fear, don't forget the west is the best in urban war ☄🇬🇧🍵🇺🇲I'm great Britain my first cousin is the United States of America,🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀✌🚀🚀☄☄☄☄☄☄☄☄☄☄☄☄☄☄
So start a war and kill civilians and get rewarded?

LOL and THIS is the clip getting top 3 in Canada youtube page ????? are they scared to let Putin actually talk to the people of the West without media censure or what ?
They basically did a 2 minute video on the title of the video.  What a beautiful time we are in.
Go put in!!
限界裏地味涙の件 〜里親アンチテーゼ〜 Ｎｏ．001．01．01 ウクライナを併合せんとしヨーロッパを注目させるプーチン大統領はジョージアで不倫の末に誕生、ロシアサンクトペテルブルクの養父母に育てられた独裁者は不遇な環境で生産されこの第一級戦犯は自分と同じ子供達を大量に生産したいらしい、これを支持するロシア人は皆ファシストだ。w
To end the war on Ukraine  Putin must declare that he is a loser and tell the world that he is lunatic.
Stupid newscast
It's really wonderful to see Turkey and Russia can work again just like 10 years ago. Erdogan is a good leader as well. And Russia, Turkey and Eastern Europe can work together without interference what a better world would be 👍
Rede doch mal deutsch Schwesta 🖐🏻
We need to keep on praying for that good news that the war between them will end.  Hallelujah in Yeshua Messiah name! Amen.🕊✌💗🌏
This media outlet just REPEATS things over and over.   "Russian Demands " ,"Russian Demands " ,"Russian Demands " ,. What is that all about ?    It's like a weather forecaster  saying ,we are going to have weather tomorrow, we are going to have weather tomorrow, we are going to have weather tomorrow, but never saying is it going to be sunny, rainy, snowing Is this woman some kind of drama queen ?   Perhaps this is not a real media outlet after all !
Until the *TRUTH about Ucrania* will not come to the surface Putin will continue to clean the *Ukrainian Nazis* who killed thousands of *Russian* for the last 8 years! *The MSM should stop telling lyes about Putin and Russia!* 😤😤😤
your reporting makes a lot of sense not other media houses that are programmed to give out false news to please their interests.
The battle of prides.
Make no mistake he is a war criminal.
Добрый вечер Русский Ютуб заблокирлвали
Give putin nothing
Not president .the butcher
Note the more recent ploy of the Kremlin trolls to try and undermine Western resolve in opposing Putin: to portray Zelenski as an unworthy president, as a warmonger and as someone who wants to destroy Europe. They are basically projecting the characteristics of Putin himself !  In their profound bitterness and jealousy of those who live in western democracies, they conjure up lie after lie, but we are not taken in. We laugh at their futile attempts to discourage us. It is pitiful to see how bound they are in the chains of their repressive, enslaving, dehumanising, outdated, 20th century, ideological mindset.
What a complete zob!
never forget ！ the greatest Russian pianist Sviatoslav Richter was born in Ukraine and grown up in Odessa 🇺🇦
This is my message to Mr. Zelensky,  Fighting to an obviously 100X stronger foe is not heroism! Its foolishness! The longer you resist and stay in Kyiv the more deaths will be. Calming Putin and stopping Russian attracts is the true victory. Please do diplomatic talk to Russia! sometimes, surrendering is the wise and best option to prevent more death and destruction just like what Japanese emperor Hirohito did during WWII. Its now about democracy or communism anymore, we are talking about the lives of innocent people especially children. If you are really a hero, sacrifice yourself(YOUR EGO) to stop the war, not sacrificing civilians to protect you.  The best way to defeat your enemy is to make them your friend!
They invaded Ukraine and trying us to stop fighting? You kidding? So they can kill us more...what a great idea for putin..evil russia politics
Russia sadly is right but unfortunately shit happens we gotta first think how much wait we have on one side of are fking planet then openion fk just gt fking hammer d motherfuckers
Hitler KAPUT!

When you're trying to meet the word count on your assignment
That’s right. Russia demands must meet. Then Russia stops. This is needed before You stop him war.
click bate BUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
Russia is hurting badly to be even having these conversations.
Russia’s gonna take the Black Sea
hello, this channel has all the fresh and relevant information about ukraine. Explosions, destruction, falls of air equipment. Everyone is here
Nope!!!! Ukraine has the right to make the conditions!!! Not a war criminal...!!! Stand STRONG UKRAINE..HE TARGETED CIVILIANS..BABYS..CHILDEREN..MOTHERS FATHERS SISTERS BROTHERS..YOU MAKE YOUR CONDITIONS!!!

Thanks for explaining what the demands are
Awful video. Why weren’t the demands stated

PUTIN is a madman and a coward...and also he is an idiot in war strategy...he will be terminated by his own people or by outside forces...make book on that...he's like a paranoid Rev Jim Jones...and that didn't workout well for Jones...
Poor Civilians Are The Ones That Suffer The Most This Is So Scary !
Your MONOTOR LETS PEOPLE ABUSE US WHITES , LIE , ABD GIVE US DEATH THREATS. WE WANT TO SUE YOU NOW.
YOUR NEWS MONOTOR LETS PEOPLE ABUSE US WHITES
This news #7 on trending
For not reaching the agreement people must die, that's why I hate politics
Unless he submits to globalism, they wontt stop. I do not believe the lies my government or the west and their pitbull medias spit out. I am disgusted on how blatant it has been. They are exploiting the suffering of Ukrainian citizens for an agenda that will bring more death and destruction on all of us. Go to WEF website. Get educated. They dont hide it. As soon as the Ukrainian gov passed out guns to citizens and made them military to send home, and publicized it, they sealed this outcome. If those citizens had rights and personal weapons before, their neighborhoods would not have been deemed a military zone. Soldiers settling up in schools. Please do your best to research. It's not easy but the hypocrisy is impossible to miss.  Truth is never hidden by those who are honest about intention. The line was set and NATO walked right on through. What Biden did in Ukraine was repulsive and he has no right to speak of the Ukrainian citizens being wronged. By his actions he does not care about them. I am American and I will attest that they are tearing down the very country they say they represent. Sovereignty of Ukraine is not their agenda. They havw destroyed our sovereignty and millions are flooding in and we have to pay for what we do not even have. .Most of our politicians sold us out for destruction. Soros funded both Biden and the president of Ukraine's campaigns. And our DA's who are systematically and brutally using criminals to attack citizens.  Appalling.
HOW MANY INNOCENT CITIZENS WERE KILL IN THE NAME OF DEMOCRATY. HOW MANY WARS DID USA STARTED AFTER WW2:    Japan (1945), Korea and China (1950-53),  Guatemala (1954),  Indonesia (1958) , Cuba (1959-61),  Guatemala (1960) , Congo (1964) , Laos (1964-73) Vietnam (1961-73) , Cambodia (1969-70) , Guatemala (1967-69) , Grenada (1983) , Lebanon (1983,1984) Libya (1986) , El Salvador (1980s) , Nicaragua (1980s) Iran (1987) , Panama (1989) , Iraq (1991 ) , Kuwait (1991) , Somalia (1993) , Bosnia (1994, 1995) , Sudan (1998) , Afghanistan (1998) , Yugoslavia (1999) Yemen (2002),  Iraq (1991-2003) , Iraq (2003-2015), Afghanistan (2001-2015) , Pakistan (2007-2015) , Somalia (2007, 2008, 2011) , Yemen (2009, 2011) Libya (2011, 2015),  Syria (2014-2015)
Ukraines terms for ending hostilities? Mr Putins head on a spike in the middle of Red Square. So good luck with your conditions Mr Putin.
Weird... no pictures of those dang pesky natzis yet ? Lil buggers are like Bigfoot or sleepy joes intelligence 😴
Putin is totally SICK.  He needs to be TAKEN OUT FAST!
PUTIN 👹👹👹👺👺👺
Arrogance has no limits in this world. World leaders incapable to find a diplomatic settlement are to blame. It is always about territorial dominance and supremacy. Isn't it?
Oh yesss Mr. Putin, the more you keep fighting!!! the more shame, disasters, and destructions you'll get!!! If you can die quietly, it will benefit your Russian citizens and the whole world!!!
what in the world was this im more confuse omg
How does one talk for 1:52 and not say anything?
One condition you should come to grips with Mr. Putin...total victory for Ukraine!
A fleet of B-52 Bombers are departing from the east coast of the United States. Are we going to war ??!!!! Someone PLEASE 🙏🥺🙏 TELL ME WHAT IS GOING ON !!!!!
Here’s the only condition. Putin leaves power and is immediately arrested.
Moscow demands Assurance of Ukraine and no other bordering country will join NATO and West will recognise Crimia and lift all sanction forced upon them.
Well, fight on, then. And stop pointless negotiations. Make those Russians pay. Dearly.
He is the biggest Cruel demon liar, he lies to his country he cannot be trusted Putin Stop your war soon you will be burning in hell for ever.
To end the war must kill the dictator suicide turn self in and white flag and capture make peace this war rules remember all dictator cannot be surrender they have plans to next level you may eyes open
Isn't this like a sudanhusan  kids died
Reporter: This just in! Putin has set demands to end Invasion in Ukraine! Me: oh nice let’s hear them Reporter: What do you mean? I just told you he set demands to end the invasion.   In other news: batman wears black.
I don't think his demands are so ridiculous.
Is  Putin  mentally sick  or  is  he  MENTALLY   SICK??  He  invaded  Ukraine  and  he  is  telling  the  world  Ukraine  must  stop  defending  itself  against  his  aggression  /  invasion.  That  would  set  the  example  for  Russia  /  Putin  to  invade  other  countries  and  demand  the  same  action  of  giving  up  their  fight  to  maintain  their  soveirenty.  Everyone  now  raise  your  right  hand  to  shoulder   height  and  repeat:    "Hiel  Putin."
I work at Dollar Tree and when I see customers that have masks on I will purposely over charge them items and smash their food without their knowledge. HAAHAHAHAAAAHAAAHAAHAAAHAHAHAHAAHAAAHAHA
The Russian soldiers have the power to end pitons orders yeah it may be a treasonous act but a heroic act to spare more lives in Ukraine that doesn’t deserve this attack. The Russian soldiers are the ones with the guns and military apparatus to stop this madness if they stand down of stand together against him. Every human on this planet has the choice make their own decisions.
Wow!
Sometimes you have to give evil a smack !  Peace will prevail.. You’d be silly not to agree with Moscow!
damn it, who are you to mess with it, my country, whoever I want to join, don't mind my mother, what does it have to do with your father and son, you're a russian, you don't have the right to say anything The lawsuit is imposed on my house, my country, you have no power in my country, you are the one to go back to your country.
please God help these countries to come on agreement to stop this war please let us put ourselves as THE People who are on this war area then  pray 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
WE ARE  EARTH 🌎 ❤  LOVE ALL &  BRING PEACE & HARMONY GOD BLESS ALL 🙌 🙏
As long as Russia is sanctioned, Biden will not pump oil in America. The money that Putin is making on oil is his assurance his economy will not collapse. Biden has made sure to take care of Russia. He knew about the Ukraine war long before it started. That is why he dropped sanctions against Russia when Biden was elected, and he gave Puttin the ok to finish his pipeline before he invaded Ukraine. Puttin was given enough time to prepare financially, before the war with Ukraine.
Kht6
He really should take all of Ukraine if they don't bend the knee.
what a joke.......  meet all our demands and  we'll compromise.                                  I for one will rejoice when Putin is removed from this sickening picture.
Saaq
Sounds like total surrender to me and The Ukraine have been falsely accused and destroyed for nothing. Too little too late Putin, you will be charged for you war crimes and be hung by the neck until you are dead. With your false accusations against The Ukraine you have driven The Ukraine people into the arms of Europe never to be your friends ever again.
Is he really in the drivers seat.  Even the Russians are fleeing and defecting,
The Oligarchy will take him down count on it Putin days are numbered one offered 1 million  get him murdered the price will rise and he will be taken care of count on it
⁰
Don't trust him he is feeling the sanctuary hit, he is guilty of criminal war crimes.
He has no legal justification to make any conditions to end the war. He needs to pull his forces out of Ukraine immediately.
When russia is mad that their former Soviet neighbour ukraine which according to Russia is also russia doesn't feel like being Russian anymore so Putin starts accusing Ukrainians who are also Russians according to putin of discriminating Russians in an area that Putin considers Russia so Russia starts invading the whole country completely destroying the lives and homes of the Russians that have been bulliying Russians and also of those very Russians russia wanted to protect from the "russians". Sending Russian soldiers to kill innocent "russians" who were wrongfully acused of genocide against russians by Russia which failing to take over the "russian" capital which makes Russia freak out and kill even more Russians which resulted in sanctions for Russia that now also affects innocent Russians in Putins actual russia,completely trashing the Russian economy and the reputation of Russians around the world. Even Russians in russia hate russia now
Maybe he should try a new conditioner.  Jus' sayin' . . . 😉
Putin started the fight. He has no right to set conditions.
pUTIN is HILTER in 2022 just like donald DRUMPF the worst president in our history of the USA>
Dont let putin make the condition and terms
She said the same thing almost 10 times shiti news shiti narrative I’ll stick to pbs
Only Jesus will bring true peace. Don't expect real peace to ever come to this world.
so what the hell are the demands???
What the hell are the demands though?
??????
The us and nato and gorbachov already did this in 1991 with the assurance that the west would not move "one inch to the east" but like the yanks they did and it has been boiling every since. Lets not forget that the ukrains military has killed approx 14,000 russians in the two disputed states in the ukraine. Putin is only doing what leaders should be doing "looking after russia and russian people" or he is trying to after years of bullying by the west.!!!
Putin needs to end the invasion immediately. He’s not only a dictator but a war criminal.  🇺🇦
Tic, Toc ...
WHAT ARE THE CONDITIONS
Try again Vlad!
NATO wants WW 3
THEY COULDN'T GET HITLER? BUT GOD WILLING SOMEONE WILL GET ( putin) ASAP AND END THIS NONSENSE!
Get back on your side of the Border, don't push the Lord.  He says what he means and will do what he says.  He won't compromise.  He is Almighty,  not this coup against the world.  Praise God!  Hallujiah!  There isn't any power in earth that can knock him down.  You see he Created It!
Putin is in no position to make any kind of demands right now.
Do your thing 🇷🇺.
Nice
Vladimir Putin is the kind of person who could make Joseph Stalin look like Yakov Smirnoff.

Very poor reporting. Just kept repeating the same thing over and over.  Never said what those conditions are.
If putins lips move, he's lying
Pootie is stalling.  Dont be fooled
I don't suppose you might want to consider reporting what the damn conditions are??? What a useless bit of need reporting!
Very simple problem. Russian soldiers remove or go back home no more fighting
Ukraine is only in defense of the invasion. Russia started the fight, so Ukraine wont stop defending until invasion stops. After all on this war do you think Russia's conditions can be trusted???
Conditions???? WTF
The U.S. Democrats do not want it to end.
What is this war about??
Just  LIKE THAT  RUSSIA  WANT END it....... DAMN HE  START.. .....& W/ CONDITION YAKKK GO TO HELL......EYE OF THE  WORLD AT IN UKRAINE....🇸🇽🇸🇽🇸🇽🇸🇽🇸🇽 OR MR. PUTIN  HE KNOW THAT  RUSSIA PAY   THE DAMAGE THEY DONE in Surprize.

Wow the pioneers of clickbaits. Answer the question without answering the question
I'm a Russian bot!!! 🤩
Poor little Putie-pie — exposing his 'shortcomings' around the globe for all to see and revile, just like his friend Mango Mussolini. He will never be Czar Putin the Great, he will be Putin the Pain-in-the-Ass.
Is he insane?  That's never going to happen.  Take that middle finger and shove it far up your ass Putin!
FVP
Ukraine President Zelensky.....just swallowed the porcupine called Putin!!
U can't seal with a tyrant, dictator, he ask for his demands lol,lol,lol,he stared this war ,an started killing  innocent people, no sir u wants come get some ,time to get this cycle out of the way ,he is not in position  to ask for demand s,he plan this war ,now let's help the ulkrane kick his ass ,so we won't hear from him again ,
To government, next time you fight each other please go to other planet where no one lives include
Putin knows he's losing the war to Ukraine. If this keeps up Ukraine will own Russia if he doesn't stop this war.  "Ukraine strong forever"
Ok you dont know what said conditions are.... so why is this news then... with no context.  Oh wait i forgot because thats news journalism now, statements with no facts or context...
Acttack any country that keep him
Let do it  cos it will effect his country ppl too and his his neighbor China cos the environment will get them too
Ukraine will say no so lol. Zelensky's choice
Russia starts a war and wants to demand shit, that's clowning. We don't negotiate with terrorists.
So what is Vladimir Putin demands
This children killer,IS runnig out of the càbala,but t'he càbala IS on his ass,you little cramp man .
Putin must put to trial and jailed
If Zelensky wants to save his country and it’s people , he knows what Pragmatic Steps he needs to take to end Russia’s military actions. Zelensky has to be less dramatic and more pragmatic- West will not save him or Ukraine- he had to do that himself with Putin  !!
I hope this ends 🙏🏽
what a croc
The wicked cheque algorithmically lie because quit secondarily escape lest a rampant forgery. sincere, hoc professor
Millions of people dieing around the world due to war so a mere handful to profit at the top...its time for god to step in and show the elites who the real boss is

TAKE OUT THE RED MENACE!!  They have CONSITANTLY LIED to the WORLD!
Too late buddy, we are comming to your house..
WHAT ARE HIS DEMANDS? TO SURRENDER UKRAINE IN HIS HANDS?
Posing tough conditions is silly, when Putin is not winning.  The other side could just fold the cards and said, “Or else what?”  Biden s gaining popularity, from 25% to 40%.  Mid term elections are held at 9 November.  He wants a drawn-out war, at least until mid November, but at the cost of Ukrainian and more of Russian blood.
Putin’s demand is *the world*
Putin goes for a fist bump....00:38
Ukraine didn't invade Russia, what the hell is Putin demanding.He should withdraw and take care of his people who are fleeing their own country.
The Iranians should accept but as they some gathered with the Russians blow them up
Putin wakil tuhan putin bersama tuhan hale luyah
But WHAT ARE THE CONDITIONS?
The world’s greatest statesman... puts the demon funded west to shame.
The way the war is going I think pretty soon Ukraine will start making demands to Russia to stop the killing of Russians in Ukraine 🤷‍♂️
Put a bounty on putin.
Nobody cares about Joe Biden 😂
Here's our condition, take a cyanide pill.
So the bully doesn't like it when someone fights back ... leave the Ukraine Putin!!!!....
Guess he want go to a country of is choice Venezuela  non trial for lid crimes
Give is mansion to families
1  give all your money to Russian people.2  sell all tats why he need 4 years communism   states President or ministercannot have 2 houses
They start the war and now they ask Ukraine to stop fighting …. 🤪
U.S. does not negotiate with terrorists....
You haven’t told me a damn thing! What are his conditions? It does no good to tell us conditions were discussed if you don’t tell us what they were. All I know is if we give Putin even one demand he  will declare victory. He needs to be slapped back so he doesn’t even think about trying again to reestablish the Soviet Union. Putin still has his KGB mindset and expects to lead a country the way it existed in the 1960s. Putin is an illegitimate leader. It is impossible to be legitimate when you kill, jail and torture political opponents. Putin is dangerous and needs to be treated as as toxic pariah. We should give our conditions to Putin. Get the hell out of Ukraine and do it NOW! For every person he kills or wounds, sanctions should be strengthened. We should be a little flexible. If Putin refuses to cease his attacks on Ukraine immediately, he should be given up to 30 seconds to do so. There, you killer war criminal. We negotiated.
All sanctions imposed on Russians Putin's should be  imediately Removed and talks have happen with Putin
Putin money is on Swiss bank account and is family is there two
S NATO and Ukrainian president should agree with Putin sab and Stop war soon as possible
Russian soldiers should refuse to go to ukraine
Putin surrender .trial for crimes many Russians  can speak up against him don't be afraid
I don't think he's getting it.
What about the denazification 🤔
What are the demands? This tells us nothing.
So he's scared and acting like he's winning.
👋🏻
Putin started this was.  The only reason he is trying to stop is because he is losing in it
Viele haben nicht verstanden das der Krieg ein Schachzug von  China ist.
don't think it works like that bozo putin
Get the job done son, let light overcome darx
If Ukraine accepts, they are morons.  Nothing will stop Russia from calling more and more regions of Ukraine "separatist regions" until the entire country is theirs.
Let's pray for peace between all countries 🙏
Remember when Ukraine gave up their nukes for a guarantee Russia would never invade? Pepperidge farm remembers. Putin reminds me of the Mars attacks aliens, with their translators saying "we come in peace" while shooting everyone with lasers.
Its better to die on your feet than live on you knees , to the best of my mind that asking me to just take you and bullies as my overlords. No!!!!! FO.
Russia and China are laughing thair asses off at America thanks to biden !
Not going your way is it Mr Putin, You can't fight the whole world no matter how big your ego is, This war will end in one way and one way only and that is with you being taken out of this world forever! We are all with you UKRAINE 🇺🇦
so its officially an invasion and not a liberation of independent regions.
Prayer is the powerful weapon 🙏 I pray to all people in Ukraine 🇺🇦 and Russia 🇷🇺 peacefully the 2 nation ✌ 🙏 amen
In summary: It's Sheila's take on the big boy talk...
The body is aware is the message from God Reality. The self realization is simple. My physical being has five senses and is aware of the environment. I exist without trying at all. I am aware without trying at all. I am pre-birth energy made into atoms. I am atoms made into flesh. I am flesh made into a physical being. Straining to focus nervous energy causes stress and disease. Let focused nervous energy totally relax. To heal and evolve the attention is no longer needed. Arise to your true nature!
Little man with big attitude
Ask The Gods.
Crazy Putin, that's his real name 👹
Hold up, let's turnaround backtracking, is Vladimir V his last name or I believe Vladimir's name is VV
seems like bro is about to lose
Is he going to reverse the funerals as well?
War drama going on in Ukraine by killing people,to maintain high crude oil prices , Russia sitting in the capital kiev for last 12 days and still war is going on , utter nonsense , nobody talks about , solar power , only gas ,petrol , diesel , crude oil nonsense
No talk moore guns to Ukraine!  Nato help with troops ukraine fast!
I wonder if Ukraine will give in to a terrorist demands?
PUTIN THE LITTLE HITLER!
WATER WARS
Russia I hate Russia
Не будет вашего орудия у порога нашей РОДИНЫ!
Как русский человек, могу сказать то что Россия не проиграет в любом случае, русский утащит за собой в ад себя и своего врага, НО НИКОГДА НЕ СДАТЬСЯ, НИКОГДА!!!!
PUTIN THE LITTLE HITLER!
This video didn't explain much at all about Putin's conditions. Putin wants Ukraine to surrender and meet all of his demands... well what are his demands?
To the people who are targeting the reporter: Even Erdogan doesn't know what is exactly meant by 'Moscow's demands' 🤣only Putin knows✌
In brief the three major demands put by Putin to bring the war on Ukraine to an end are: 1. Ukraine must give an assurance of not  joining NATO at any cost. 2. Accepting the sovereignty of Russia on Crimea by Ukrainian Goverenment.  3. Recognition of Donestsk and Luhansk as two  separatist regions in Eastern Ukraine due the their pro-russian ethnicity and culture
They’re not “Sanctions” they’re special economic conditions.
What are russia's demands?
Ukraine should continue fighting.
What a waste of time.  I could have made this garbage video from my garage.  They told everyone absolutely NOTHING
thank you so mucH!
Useless news story, not telling us what the demands are.
Kiero mirar mas
Not falling for that. Putin started this bloody thing in the first place.
Just stop your madness Putin, before some of your ogliarcs come and disappear you to all others benefit. Countdown has started days ago.
ПУТИН защищает свою страну от нацистов
Putin is a terrorist!!!
perhaps much of the world as we know it may go but putin will see his country and dreams completely demolished along with him is a strong possibility. he has already been humiliated and will get worse. no matter what the world can not stand by and let him get away with what he is doing.
You will loose Putin!!*
To put his demands shortly: “Surrender or die”
Thanks for explaining what the demands are
i hate him sm
The sooner someone in Russia takes down Vladimir Putin  the better not only for Russia but for the entire world. Vladimir Putin has all the traits of suffering either from manic Dementia/Alzheimer’s Disease, Narcissistic, real Manic Schizophrenia Paranoia, or possibly suffering from all of them. So if Vladimir Putin is not taken out/down, he will definitely start the next World War Three which will not benefit the world but will be a disaster for Russia.
All of the fighting doesn't have to be in Ukraine. Russia can feel it as well.
what are Moscow's demands? this segment is useless without that info-
Russia won't last two days against the U.S Military.
How about the USA just make them stop with no help from anybody?
tarumlüg rutangisnetauq   Programmierer  der  Master K. I.      !..
"Basic quote that is clearly common sense" -some famous guy.
The West is decadent and divided
we don't negotiate with terrorist
he try to fist bump that guy lmao
Ukraine to surrender, there will be time to regain sovereignty when Putin is condemned.   People's lives come first!!!   Are you blind??
You said nothing about his actual demands. Putin wants Ukraine to stay out of the EU and NATO and declare themselves neutral.
🙏🏻
You know how this works anyone not in the United Nation.. Russia will attack circling Europe!! There goes Switzerland and all those not in the United Nation!!
Lie. Tell him you will meet his demands then kill him in the meeting. Lol
Hi
“Nothing will end war unless the people themselves refuse to go to war.” -Albert Einstein.
What are moscows demands? I haven’t heard them
Raining Toms but don't like cats that don't like mustard if you can see eyeglasses for the witches will never stew the buttons from window panes but a Tom Brady card raisins the winter. I forgive nothing but lamps just like a Snickers bar will open dresser drawers during the moon Fox skylit.
Ukraine should have never given up their nukes.
What are the demands from moscow? Probably what they have been asking for over at least over the last two decades from  nato.. Hello, is anyone listening?
"Putin sets conditions" means Ukrainian soldiers must put down their weapons. That's ridiculous! Shut up!
This war is India's fault.
Poor journalism. What are Moscow’s demands?
Not gonna happen 🙅‍♂️
Since they failed to mention the demands in the video, here they are:  Cease military action. Change Ukraine’s constitution to focus on neutrality. Surrender Crimea to Russia. Acknowledge the two separatist regions of Ukraine - Donetsk and Luhansk - as their own independent states.
Ukraine is not worth WW3. So, yes, no no-fly zone by NATO or the US. This time US mainland will not be spared if we head for WWIII over Ukraine. Yes, send weapons to Ukraine and let them fight. Like how Russia and China never entered Vietnam but supplied weapons to eventually win there.
🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷💙🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷
What are the demands fs am I crazy or did rhus video take 2 min to say nothing
Putin can shove his demands up his arse.
some useless video
I knew it
What a guy
Upside down world. I hit you hard multiple times in the face, but I'll stop if you stop grabbing on to my shirt when you fall down. But only if you amputate your arms and legs so you can't pull my shirt every time I feel like punching you. If that's not a bully, what is?
This will not end with Ukraine if they give in Putin's cultural pride runs stronger than his back hair
putin huilo
This is God sick joke
"putin is og" -Albert Einstein
if russa and china think they can beat the rest of the world, fucking bring it !
It’s NOT a “conflict” or other false terms they try to label it!  It’s a war, it’s an invasion!  It’s international terrorism!
Lets see, the U.S. sponsored the 2014 coup in Ukraine, Bidens son was appointed to the Board of an energy company with no experience in energy, Biden holds back money from Ukraine until they fire the prosecutor investigating his son and others for corruption, in late 2016/early 2017 John McCain and Lindsay Graham go to Ukraine and tell them your fight is our fight regarding the Ukrainian disputes with Russia. Wake up people. This is another U.S./NATO instigated event
Putin wants no militia to fight against, no sanctions, and free air space to do what they want, that's not what the war with NATO and the USA is going to look like.
For those who don't know the conditions(copied from twitter): KREMLIN SPOKESMAN SAYS  (1)UKRAINE MUST AMEND CONSTITUTION AND REJECT CLAIMS TO ENTER ANY BLOC (2)UKRAINE MUST RECOGNISE CRIMEA AS RUSSIAN,  (3)AND DONETSK AND LUGANSK AS INDEPENDENT STATES   IF THESE CONDITIONS ARE MET, THEN RUSSIAN MILITARY ACTION WILL ‘STOP IN A MOMENT’ - SPOKESMAN  Wion never do such things again
Russia are taking heavy losses and the invasion appears to have been an operational disaster. It's now been revealed to the world that essentially their military prowess isn't what we believed it was, and they're probably on a fast track to a full on banking collapse there. What an absolute disaster of a "special military operation"
Then NATO and the world  should say to turkey to get the fk out of Cyprus and leave the beautiful Greek islands alone why didn’t the world stand up for Cyprus when turkey invaded them just like they are doing for Ukraine ? 🇬🇷❤️🇨🇾💪🏼
Pootin is a grub.
"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life."     -John 3:16 God gave us his only son Jesus Christ who Lived a sinless Life then died on the cross to endure our punishment, he rose again on the 3rd day and is currently seated at the right hand of God the Father Almighty.  Jesus is returning to Judge the world soon my Friends Please Repent and believe in his sacrifice and Love for you, believe in him as your Lord and Saviour, and you shall be saved.   May God Bless you all.
So basically these conditions are not known to us despite you putting the conditions in your own title  Typical reporter
it like to ask the 37000 people what they gave a like for
Putin conditions: blah blah blah Our conditions: Putin's head on a spike
Semoga dunia kembali damai 🙏
Wtf are Moscow demand

Russia will stop 'in a moment' if Ukraine meets terms - Kremlin Catherine Belton Mon, March 7, 2022, 6:57 AM  By Catherine Belton  LONDON (Reuters) -Russia has told Ukraine it is ready to halt military operations "in a moment" if Kyiv meets a list of conditions, the Kremlin spokesman said on Monday.  Dmitry Peskov said Moscow was demanding that Ukraine cease military action,  change its constitution to enshrine neutrality,  acknowledge Crimea as Russian territory,  and recognize the separatist republics of Donetsk and Lugansk as independent states.  It was the most explicit Russian statement so far of the terms it wants to impose on Ukraine to halt what it calls its "special military operation", now in its 12th day.  Peskov told Reuters in a telephone interview that Ukraine was aware of the conditions. "And they were told that all this can be stopped in a moment."

Love putin🇷🇺
Mr.putin ...you have resisted the God sir... I am sorry
President Putin kills whole population of Ukraine to force its govt to meet Putin whims n caprices. How sick Mr Putin is?
ABOUT NAH
Putin has yet to put out serious conditions. These are the same excuses he used for the invasion.
Uh huh. Just like the "deal" Putin made to not harm them if they gave up their nuclear weapons? What happened to that deal? Oh yeah. PUTIN INVADED ANYWAY. What a joke. He just wants easier targets. Nothing more. Anyone who surrenders is jost going to be killed anyway. Hes already lied about harming people in the first place. Why stop now?
The president of Ukraine should beheld accountable for war crimes, gendercide, threason among other crimes against humanity. For putting the people life to death.
...No. No deal. Pft. What makes Putin think hes in the position to make any terms except unconditional surrender? ...Oh, wait. We have a potato in charge of the only ones able to fully stop him....  Nevermind. Lets here it.  Guess we'll never know because this "news channel" isn't smart enough to actually say what he wants. Or aren't saying on purpose. Wth.
Seems like misdirection, honestly.
Це називається свобода слова? Навіщо ви вдаляєте мої коментарі?
did they really just spend 2 minutes saying the conditions are his demands 4 times? i never would have thought...
We need give punishment to all countries who are doing invasion and targeting Human being
Putin, how about you end the war if Ukraine for one unblocks the freshwater canal that runs into Crimea that Ukraine dammed up after Russia annexed Crimea. In my opinion this is a must since Crimea is and has been in a severe shortage of fresh water it's at the point of a crisis.   Ukraine allows Russia to continue to use its natural gas pipeline that runs through Ukraine without the crazy billions and billions every year in tariffs that Russia has been paying.   If in the future Ukraine does end up joining NATO then Ukraine and NATO has to agree there will be NO nuclear weapons in Ukraine or in it's territorial waters. Btw Russia, you are way over concerned with having a border with a NATO country, as you recently realized war has changed a lot since WW2 and your war with Afghanistan. Wars are mostly fought with UAVs, cruise missiles, stealth aircraft and then the after nearly everything is wiped out then ground troops move in, you don't have to have to have a border with the enemy to be invaded (amphibious and airborne invasion). And still if it's really that much of a concern than maybe have a demilitarized zone on both sides of the border similar to north and south Korea or fortify your border  where it would be suicidal to launch a ground invasion. Better yet Russia how about you consider becoming a NATO country.  Maybe my ideas are totally idiotic but anything is better than the pointless waste of countless civilians. We are well aware of Ukraine's war crimes against its own people, killing and assaulting its own citizens for the most trivial of crimes (being beaten and shot for being out past curfew)... Well good luck.
The demands?? You didn't say! So dumb.
No Russian is innocent
What are the demands thou??
yeah ok now what are the damn demands...
Such a lier
Putin is the man! Defend your borders defeat those Nazis 💪🏼
So what were the demands of moscow?
Wait... What? They will stop shooting at you if you stop invading their country & leave.
Get out of satan system and get in God system before it's to late ⏳
The USA has NO reason
War Stop for world welfare. God bless always.
0:38?da fook fist pump?
Do you think those people will ever be friends again even if Ukraine leaves NATO?I don't get Presidents of some countries thinking they're God n immortal....stop killing people n mind ur Russia
This whole conflict started with Russia trying to expand into Crimea, the largest country by area, much of which is in an area, Siberia, which due to climate change, is becoming more inhabitable every day, in the world. Russia needs to expand? Give Crimea back to Ukraine. Crimea cannot exist if Ukraine cuts off its water supply. It was insane to attempt to divide Crimea and Ukraine, an effort that lead to this. The oil in the Black Sea belongs to Ukraine, not Russia. Greed is a simple Vice to overcome but the genius Putin has not succeeded in doing so. Putin will never succeed in claiming the offshore oil in the Black Sea that has been his goal since taking Crimea from Ukraine. The sooner the United Nations and the International Community accepts this the sooner global stability will be restored and the threat of Nuclear War ended
There's something I've failed to understand?, who's Putin to start putting all those conditions on an independent democratic country when himself has failed to leave the office for years now
Imagine if the media was independent...
Go Hard or Go Home (feat. Stressmatic of the Federation) viva la Putin !
PUTIN   IS   PURE   EVIL. PEACE   MUST   BE   GIVEN   A   CHANCE. HOWEVER    HOW    CAN   ANYONE   TRUST    PUTIN   WHO   ONLY   HAS   MUCH    HATRED   AND    EVIL   IN  HIS   HEART.
DMX - X Gon' Give It To Ya (Official Music Video) потому что.
Also, one of the demands is to bring to justice all armed right-wing radical groups that have been terrorizing part of the Ukrainian population for several years who did not want to be part of a country officially supporting the Nazi regime.
Putin is a flat out lunatic and a Hitler wannabe.
It’s been over a week.  Has Vlad found his Nazis yet?
God's will be done.. may God help us  to always follow Christ and be prepared for the coming harpazo (1Thessalonians 4:17)! pls. follow Christ,  repent, turn away from sin, and get rid of any form of idolatry while there is still little time left.. Do not take the mark of the beast written in Revelation chapter 13..the Bible is our Basic Instructions Before Leaving Earth.. Maranatha!!!
Really!!! What are the demands??? Putin wont take responsibility for ruining so many lives..and for placing the responsibility of the Ukranianians in the hands of Poland and neighbouring countries .. what a shame.. what president does this..absolutely ludicrous..will he rebuild their homes replace their posessions..their lives will never be the same..why is there no attack on Russia? ..Dear Lord and benevolent Heavenly Father ..please be with these refugees and brave soldiers protecting them..and richly bless the neibouring countries for accommodating and protecting them..be with those that stayed behind Lord..may the blood of Jesus flow over them...in Jesus Mighty  name..Amen 🕇🇿🇦prayers from South Africa
sooo what are the demands? did I missed it, or was it not mentioned in the clip
This is hilarious... "we invaded your country, but you stop fighting and give us what we want first, then we'll stop".
Of course russia wants its demands met, THATS WHAT A DEMAND IS
WHy doesn't turkey leave cyprus before talking
He knows he's fucked. Ukraine shouldn't agree to any of Russia's conditions. They should only keep downing their jets and blowing up their tanks while Russia collapses.
we will see .
It's a disgraceful act and in 2022 it is unthinkable, it is heartbreaking seeing civilians and our Ukrainian brother die inn for a NUT JOB in Moscow. we all need to sacrifice to help Ukraine repel this lunatic
Euh yeah okay but what actually are these demands?   They keep repeating "if Moscow's demands are met" but they didn't say exactly what were these demands
He doesn't even have leverage except nukes that are probably non functioning. The world can just force his cronnies and economy to freefall
why doesn't the usa attack like they bombed iraq afghanistan syria us balkans
masa biziz
'NUTS!'
US loves the war in Ukraine for the simple fact that American defense companies are making billions of $. US and NATO is still licking it's wounds after the humiliating defeat in Afghan. Note Taliban had only AK-47, RPG and motorcycles.
Whatever he agrees to he will go back on. Whatever the Ukrainians and Russians agree, the west must keep sanctions in place and state their own set of demands.
so smart I'm glad I was alive during this time . can't wait to tell my kids about how one dumb person set off a series of problems for the world. my kids won't think anything of it once they find out it was a special military operation.... ahahahahahahah.
I feel like he broke war laws we dont negotiate with terrorists.. off with his head
And which conditions do Putin ask for in detail?
So...what are Moscow's demands?
0:29 it's Europe ! They haven't faced a refugee crisis since WW2 and have lived comfortably , what do you expect lmao.
You never said what the conditions are. Junk video!
Putin: Starts a war  Also Putin: HEY HEY... hey. I will stop the war if you _unconditionally surrender_
Pointless report -- what are the demands?  EVERY conflict ends when demands are met, so it tells us nothing.
No one got that million bounty yet? damn shame...
He's scared now.
NATO/USA is the aggressor. Putin is defending he’s security
Never forget God loves you and is our lord and savior
This war was bound to happen. What happened in 1990?? Didn’t NATO make a deal with Russia that they weren’t going to expand at all and now they want to put a base in front of Russia. Ahahaha I wonder how the USA would feel if there was Russian middles in Mexico or Canada.
I pray whoever see this you’ll be successful in life, God  has a plan for you  just trust the process never give up  God bless everyone🖤
The intention behind this is to flood Germany with refugees, soon we will be totally broke...
Literally 2 commander and a war lord are dead.
Putin said "if Ukraine stops fighting" who started the war then???
Not much to think about with those conditions - NO! Putin wins, Ukraine loses.
What are the condition..asss reporter
Thanks for explaining what the demands are
It's Interesting that if Trump had won a second term he would have taken the U.S out of Nato...that would actually have been more dangerous than even now...with U.S out of Nato... expansion by Russia would have already happened and at a faster pace.
Putin cannot win this war. Even if Putin achieves its goals militarily and the Ukrainian army and political leadership capitulate, neither Crimea nor the Donbass will be recognized internationally as independent republics or as parts of Russia. And the resistance of the Ukrainian population against the Russian occupiers will cause many deaths on the Russian side. And the international sanctions will remain in place or will be expanded until Putin gives up. PUTIN cannot win this war. Russia has already lost. The only way out for Putin is to resign before he is "moved" to do so by the Russians themselves.
What's the use of this video when you don't tell Moscow's demands at all?
After what the world has witnessed from Putin he should not be asking for any conditions to be met in order to put a halt to his invasion. He is a murderous liar and a warmonger!!  Glory to Ukraine 🇺🇦❤ Slava Ukraine 🇺🇦 🇺🇦 🇺🇦
A lots of words with nothing said
NATO computer found in Ukraine military base with detail of attack on the Donbass area for 8 March 22.  If this happens we can all kiss our arse good by
So... WHAT are the demands?  Someone needs to put Putin in his place. 6 Feet under would be suitable.
Finally the end is in sight.  There is absolutely no way that Putin would tell a lie, therefore I say we believe everything he says from this point forward.
What is his demands that need to be met❓🤔
Condition this, killer
Well, you always were a kidder, Putin
Paardenlul
Putin has lost his mind
Even if war is ended the west and allies will not stop conquering Russia because the middle east is nearing it end of supply of oil
He wants Ukraine to stop fighting? Lmao, Ukrainians shall never give in to the army of this hypocrite
Ukraine lost from the moment that the criminal Zelensky told that he want in NATO. Marrionete of US
Hope they can find a peaceful resolution!
The lady reporter is so beautiful.  Just saying lol
The news channel which knows more about other countries than its own North East India.
What a waste of time. Tell us the full news, or dont bother wasting our time. You said next to nothing in this video but were talking constantly through it.
Go nuke and don't care of them. If they dare to respond go super nuke. There's nothing to mediate here.
what are the demands of russia?
Putin started the show, controlled it (well almost) then now talk to himself for puttin an end to his own game ?!  Ok, how more self-centered or narcissist can this be ?  Baby boy with his deadly toys.
Putin is in command . Everything is going according to plan . 10k + Russians Soldiers killed. lol
Gotta put that dog in a cage
That is one sided condition and only favors Russia. Ukraine defends their sovereignity against invationist Russia
We need peace ✌️ no need for war right now,we are still in Pandemic.Many died in COVID-19.
Putin reminds me of an American cop. Screaming at you to stop resisting, while they are trying to beat you to death as you ly cuffed on the ground.
Political egos....killing of people.
The war should stop if:  Ukraine is allowed to be part of NATO, But the eastern regions and crimea are given to russia.
I will add to Russian condition: Zelensky must resign forthwith! He brought this calamity upon Ukraine by joining NATO and threatening the national security of Russia.
i say we don't stop until we have this man butt naked in a cellar somewhere, he's scared now it's too obvious lol
Hnd maganda kc ginawa tlaga ni putin,, dapat pinag usapan nlng or hinayaan nlng ni putin kc marami tao namatay bata
How can we be so dumb to let a single person decide our lives and fate
It's Er-Dogan not Erdwan
Call his bluff. Teach him a lesson. Is the free world of liberty too live under Putin fear & rule?
Dont give up Ukraine!!!! FU Puttin! Your disgusting! You are a murderer!!! Do you all understand that killing people is wrong.  If you kill one person, your arrested, convicted and jailed. So why do we give this 70 year old the power to take LIVES AND destroy our beautiful EARTH? WHY?
Don't trust Vladimir Putin he is a traitor
So his demand is their surrender?
PUTIN THE LITTLE HITLER.
putin is a dictator and a murderer but not a president
Don't believe the media this was orchestrated by the Global Elites a pre WW3 power play..
Zelenski 👹👹👹👹👹👹
Mark my words-Putin is coming for US next.  If Trump is next president - Trump has already told Putin he would like  him walk right in and take control over America.  He'd turn into a socialist/communist country.  Is that what you want USA?
The idiots in Ukraine need to surrender. Problem solved.
Well would you want to negotiate with a Hitler-mass murderer and a Stalin together?  That's what Putin is.
This video is #2 on us trending page
Quit eating meat and dairy!!!!
Too late....... Putin putana needs to go to prison.........lock him up now.....stop stuffing around and Lock him Up.......you can't turn a blind eye to war crimes.
i ❤️ Russia i ❤️ Putin
Go russia
Hope Russia accepts  Ukraine  soveringty.
So let the Ukraine accept the conditions!  BUT THAT DOES NOT MEAN THE WORLD HAS TO ACCEPT THEM , keep the sanctions going and make Russia pay !
And the conditions are?...............crickets I hear crickets
Long life for best man putine .💪💪💪💪💪
I heared that Putin has cancer and now he want to get a place in history books before he dies, and in my opinion he dont look healthy, maybe by medics against cancer (cortison).
No problem...1. He will stop when he controls the Ukraine completely, 2. then he will invade in Moldavia. After that? I dont know, to attack a NATO state will unleash the WW 3 or the end of the NATO when they dont protect a member by fear about Russia (Estonia, Litvia etc) or maybe he will get Georgia (Russia, not US, haha).
Ban Russian Oil and crash the economy to zero..
И что вы думаете?
What's his demands?
Putin is going down his people is against him then he will be charged with war crimes
Putin won’t stop till he has all of eastern Ukraine
Would you like to join legion?
Putin is a psycho maniac
Oh..for heavens sake....let's bomb Moscow...war done immediately.
Everyone is blaming Putin and not a single one is blaming zelenskyy. It's either people are blind and deaf or just people are now plain stupid and believe anything they have heard.
It is worth noting trade between India and Russia is $9.4 billion so far this fiscal. It’s already about 20% up from the previous year. India imports from Russia fuels, mineral oils, nuclear reactors, boilers, machinery and mechanical appliances, electrical equipment, and fertilizers. Its major exports include pharmaceutical products, electrical machinery and equipment, organic chemicals, and vehicles. Little wonder, in its own interest of trade, India has chosen not to take sides, but clearly, they have! India’s trade with Ukraine is $2.3 billion this fiscal and is down by 10%. Regarding the size of the bilateral trade alone, Russia is almost three times a bigger trade partner, and if one looks at the composition, it beats Ukraine. Historically, Russia assumed a weighty place in India’s foreign policy, notwithstanding recent geopolitical and economic equations.
So he wants them to stop fighting back... Hes a joke
Clickbait
TURKEY KEY ROLE .. LETS HOPE THE WAR STOPS AND INNOCENTS GOT RELIEF SOON!
It would be helpful, if these demands were listed out in your report. I suspect the demands would include 1.) Remove missiles from border, 2.) hand over scientist that were running the bio-warfare labs ( funded by countries such as US and Israel), 3.) withdraw your fighting 4.) remove Zelensky from his position. 4.) Shut down pedophile networks that were discovered.  Ukraine will need to decide if these points and possibly others is something that they are willing to die for.
Moscow put conditions to stop the war but NATO will outsmart the conditions. Many times Russia had been cheated.
what are his conditions?
oblivion is coming, bliss is about to happen. The end of the human species, and this nightmare called "existence". Thank you Putin for bringing us sweet death and the end of this shitty earth.
La única condición, la rendición del ejército ruso o su muerte.
this video did not explain well
Thank U, infinite intelligence. ♾
What are those conditions and demands?
Respect presido
Putin literally wants Ukraine to surrender then. It's really up to both leaders.they are brothers anyway.if the world won't intervene, I believe their issues could be settled faster.
What a terrible accent. I can hardly understand her at all. Is she trying to speak English?
I can't say putler in the position to make demands nowadays.
He is going to hell!
The only demand that should be is Russia leave all of Ukraine immediately without conditions
I don't see the russian demands on this video.  So where does Asif Ansari (a poster here) get his version of demands from?  I ask because, within last half hour, Zelensky messaged on AUTV that Russian shelling on center of cities begins Monday.
Which youtube admin thought it would be a good idea to put a video with ZERO EXPLANATION of the conditions on the #2 trending. This video does not even say the conditions. Pure click bait
Its obvious what Putin wants, Ukraine will not join NATO but Zelensky said he wants too. This is like America being afraid about the Soviets putting missiles in Cuba.
I live in Ukraine (Odessa region) Russia helps us humanitarianly, they protected us from the Nazis who killed civilians. I say what I saw with my own eyes.
How They Will Know If Ukraine Stop Figthing Not To Be Killed How Will They Trust The Russians ?
And no elaboration upon the demands?
Yooo yo
You better read that peace agreement carefully. Russia is losing a lot of troops and weapons and their economy is tanking fast but they still have a lot they haven't used yet.
what?? Pussiten is the one in Ukraine attacking everything. now Pussitin asking for Ukraine to stop fighting!!!
In other words Russia is asking Ukraine to surrender?
who are u Putin to dictate other people, shame on you, so many russian soldiers are dying because of you...  so many are wishing that erased in this world!!!
Never stop fighting Ukraine! It should  be Russian invasion withdrawal. Then the fighting would stop!
Ukraine please surrender NOW and stop this unnecessary war
You'd think in a segment titled "Putin puts conditions to end the conflict" that they'd actually mention what the "conditions" actually are.
The only country that can stop Russia now is China.
Putin is lying its a trick to continue shelling whilst the Ukrainians turn into sitting ducks
What moscows demands?
Outing demands are simple he wants Poland and Finland as well as ukraine to give up their country.
What are moscows demand????????? Duh????
What are these conditions?
U r the trespasser,unwelcome invader. U don't get to set the conditions to leave. It's  best for u to abandon all wild dreams of bringing back the old USR,making jor ppl suffer unnecessarily in the process. Move out of the way Mr. "Bullie" n let jor ppl share their brilliance to the world.
Remember "no Russians"
He went for a fist bump
Minutes in and still no info on conditions
that’s not gonna happen plain and simple.
Whatever demand it is,,,respect and granting so this war end.People of both countries may get back to normal and peaceful life again.May the spirit of humanity and sincerety dwell in the heart of the leader... God bless and peace on earth!
If only Ukraine stops fighting?😳😳😳 Who should stop fighting???
I am horrified by the number of people commenting in here who do not understand how precious democracy is and the price Ukrainians have been willing to pay.
US government funds Bio Weapons labs and testing on poor Ukrainians. AZOV Battalion is the NAZI's who must be eliminated.
OK HAIRBRAIN!  dafugg are the conditions? what a bunch of halfwits in lamestream media we have today, unreal
murders
Take 5 min. and google AZOV battalion. May change views.
Sad to see innocent lost of life of man women and children not to mention the fasted growing humanitarian crisis in Europe at the moment. I wish people throughout the world can take the same stand when it comes to the brutal and barberic machinery of the Israeli defense forces against the people of Palistine.
AH🙂 ERDOGAN IS STEPPING UP! INDEED. THE THREE SOVERIEGN COUNTRIES IN THAT BLACK SEA REGION -- RUSSIA - TURKEY - UKRAINE -- CAN FORM A TROIKA!! THEY ARE THE ONE TO BE IN COMMAND OF THAT BLACK SEA REGION! POLITICAL CREATIVITY!! ERDOGAN BEING A NATO MEMBER IS THE "STOP GAP" CONNECTIVITY TO NATO, NATO HAS ONLY AN INCENDIARY PRESENCE OR A NON-COMMANDING COMPONENT. THE TROIKA IS THE SUPREME IN CHARGE OF THAT WATER!! SURELY THE THREE CAN COME UP WITH A "PEACE TREATY & AGREEMENT" A VERY IN-DEPTH & ALL ENCOMPASSING PACT THAT SERVES FIRST & FOREMOST THE INTEREST OF THE "TROIKA" REGARDLESS OF NATO OR UKRAINE'S DEMOCRACY. IN OTHER WORDS, THE WEST HAS GOT NO ROLE, NOTHING TO DO WITH THAT TROIKA PACT! IT ONLY SERVES THE INTEREST OF THE THREE FOR PEACE & SECURITY OF THEIR THREE COUNTRIES! AH😇 THE HUMAN SPIRIT IS STILL CAPABLE OF POLITICAL CREATIVITY AFTER ALL. GLORY TO GOD!!! MAY GODLY WISDOM LIGHT & GUIDE. 😇🙂😇😃😇😄😇
Russia should end this war without any preconditions! Targeting civilians and residential property amounts to war crimes! Russia should do the right thing!
1:17 Putin goes in for a fist bump
Putain.
Putin just like: (just like raping woman)        I will rape your nation stop resisiting
From a distant shore.  Putin initiated war against a peaceful country and now lays down the conditions under which he'll cease his aggression. What will he do next? Demand the Ukrainian government pay reparations to Russia? What a thug.
At some level of oppression, by these governments, the common people will eventually strike out in methods never once imagined in the past.
I believe the greatest form of love is shone to us by sacrifice. What we are willing to give up for the love of someone else. Too often and too frequently is life filled with bitterness, anger, hatred, and jealousy. Just imagine what kind of world it would be if we all loved one another, if we all cared, and had concern for each other. That we all did our best to make sure life was good for everyone.  That no one was homeless, that no one faced despair, rejection, or pains of loneliness and self-doubt. That there were no more wars, wars built on greed, and man's fear of each other, fear of the unknown. I think of the ultimate sacrifice when a carpenter named Jesus Christ from Bethlehem faced beatings, whippings, insults, injury, and crucifixion for our sins. who died so we could become righteous, to never again face the fear of death or the nightmares of the pains of hell ever again. a righteousness we could never earn unto ourselves, not based on our performance, but given to us as a gift of mercy. Call unto the Lord Jesus Christ, forsake your sins, believing with all your heart that he is the God who created heaven and earth, and he will gladly forgive you and welcome you unto the family of God forever. ''For God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son, that everyone who believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life'' John 3:16   "This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.  For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,  Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good,  Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God;  Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away.  For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead captive silly women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts,  Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth"  2 Timothy 3:1-7  ''The Lord is not slack concerning His promise, as some count slackness, but is longsuffering toward us,  not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance'' 2 Peter 3:9
I also demand objective reporting. Where are the conditions set by Russia?
Your report is vague. What the hell are the those conditions?
GG 🍺😎
The military should have been smart and attacked moscow while the russians had tons of their military in ukraine!
why is the reporter repeating 4 statements over and over again??? I was thinking we were going to be told the "Set Conditions" but she's just blubbing
Putin : we will stop  Also Putin: 😉
Apparently Russia's invasion of Ukraine is not going well for Putin. China requested a ceasefire from the UN in 1953 when the Korean War was not going well for China.
They’re not “Sanctions” they’re special economic conditions.
For anyone wondering, largest part of Moscow's Demands is that Ukraine stays neutral and won't ever join NATO.
I was under the impression that China would play the role of mediator. Quite surprised to see that Turkey is playing that role now.
Putin invaded ukraine physically but the world invaded him digitally lmaaao 😂😂😂😂😂
So WHAT EXACTLY ARE PUTINS CONDITIONS??? atleast tell us them after announcing he's made any!
Demands are: Ukrainians must surrender and give Moscow full control over Ukraine. Basicly Putin demands Ukraine to stop existing.
Ukraine are not gonna stop fighting  if Russia  keep attacking 😄
no way, Putin is spewing BS.  the fact that 95% of Russian armed forces are now in the country of Ukraine means,  Russia will occupy all of Ukraine even in the event of a ceasefire.  the only way you will know that Russia will cease fire is when they actually completely withdraw.  and guess where they will withdraw? - into Belarus and station itself around its borders.
Russian economy is ready to collapse , the war is a completely failure , now let's the Russians people lynch their Kremlin leader and all his goons once and for all.  🇺🇦
Wait! What? Putin requested an end to the invasion of Ukraine? Why doesn't Putin simply order an end to the Russia invasion of Ukraine?
So it's not a diplomatic discussion, he's dictating
Don t believe Putin
Have peoples freedom freedom to speech freedom to oust putin
Ukraine's surrender to Russia is what Putin is demanding to end the Russia invasion of Ukraine.
To end the confict putin has to resign and not greed in power
Wait... What?
🙏🕉❤
Basically, they're saying "To stop invasion, Ukraine must bend over without resistance..."
He wont get any, and probably will drive more countries to NATO.
Putin ordering the withdrawal of Russian forces from Ukraine should be the first condition to end the invasion of Ukraine.
No dice. Russia is the invader. Russia should stop the fighting first. Ukraine has every right to SELF DEFENCE. Ukraine's sovereignty is at stake. Do not allow Russia to break up Ukraine. Breakaway regions should expel Russian forces. Ukraine should join NATO. Putin's terms are RUBBISH
The door of Hell is already opened for Putin, it's only a matter of time and God is waiting for him there because of the Blood of the Innocence Ukrainians and the blood of His Own Soldiers he sold at War.
SHUCK MY ASH
If anybody believes these Russians they will end up like fools.
I thought this would explain what those demands are. Dumb clickbait
Ukraine would stop fighting if Putin's men would leave UKRAINE"S country!
BOOOO! SLAVA UKRAINE!! They will NEVER lay down for terrorist dictators!!! Poison Pukins underpants like he did to Navalny!!

Would you believe any of this? This is another "we will not invade moment" two days before tanks rolled over border. So now after 10's of thousands of lives of men, women and children have been blown away by Russian Army, cities destroyed and the economy crushed, Putin just tell troops to walk away? Don't believe this rubbish. This is a terrible blunder by Putin and Russia that has simply become an exercise in mass murder.
Reminscent of the Israeli/Palestianian conflict where one side defines their borders whilst insisting that the other side de-militarize? How well has that worked out ?
1:16 mans was going in with a fist bump at first
WHY WION dont show how RUSIIAN altylery stike GREEN CORIDORS
Zelensky’s corrupt Kiev's Azov government does not speak for humanity.   Ukrainian ambassador: "There is no purgatory for war criminals”; When a Defence Lawyer invokes God, you know he has got zilch fact based evidence;
Нет 👎
You should also reported about the demands. They are the same for 8 years. Not entering na...t0, not threatening R by building na..t0 military bases in Ukr. In other words to create neutral zone in Uk.
Am I hearing it correctly “if Ukraine stops fighting ….” . Russia first of all is invading which is fighting. And Ukraine is simply defending. Now, if there is a peace treaty somewhere I know for sure the conditions set forth is that Putin will not bow down to anyone and the agreement will be a surrendering act for the other country. Wow just wow.
Russian orcs war against humans  Dont buy russian stuff in shops!!!
ПУТИН напал на Украину , РФ бомбит мирные города Украины , НЕТ ВОЙНЕ !
Putin is a nut case
Destroy Ukraine Support Russia full Support From Pakistan I know that day When World kill Muslim, Muslims of Burma. KASHMIR. PALESTINIAN. IRAQ AFGHANISTAN. NO one stand with us just China and Turkey support us 🇵🇰💓🇷🇺
He's lying
👎👎👎🇺🇦✊
Make no fly zone please!!!!
Stop fighting if the Russian are not in Ukrainian territories,why you halts firing when their is invaders.
What's the conditions demamded
Right, turkey is all of a sudden the good guy. Turkey? The country that’s historically the most evil country to exist is all of a sudden the good guy. Nice one
What are the demands anyone?
Little Vlad almost didn't make this address because the organisers couldn't find a tall enough box for Little Vlad to stand on. Without the box, and even with his favourite shoe risers in, Little Vlad couldn't see over the podium ...he was so angry he threatened to invade Moldova
Putin thought invading a country was easy because he did it to Georgia. Georgia is not Ukraine. Lesson learned.
Not only civilian just think about the pets separation from their master and all the noise from bombing it's terrifying for them too.
Putin retreat his criminal from UKRAINA this is only condition to end war
Putin will be held liable for the act of war he inflected in Ukraine and he will be punished by hanging on public place....
Russians dont like blacks but they dont have problems praying to their holy black ones,all cathedrials in Russia the holy ones are black,why you think that is so ?
Today Mad Dog Putin want Ukraine, tomorrow it will be your country!!!
Ohhh ok, so it's all good now is it? If Ukraine tows the line? It's too late putin you can't invade a country and think the world will forgive you.
Ukrainian soldiers are also trying to create terrorist attacks on the Russian army, which is extremely shameless
I hate war loosing everything you have made so long and never getting them back 🥺🥺
Give to Putin what he wants and save the lives of the children. Common people. Simple mathematics!
Will he stand by his word?
Yes take control of the Ukrainian orthodox church
Russia go give NATO a big L
surrender and give up your country thats not coditions that ultimatums
Lies, as usual. Putler lies. Do not trust him.
Sooo what were the conditions
Amen 🙏🙏🙏❤️❤️❤️
I guess the US decided not to show their faces in this defeat?
Putin is like a hostage taker. He demands a lot, when obviously non of it will be granted. Idiot, this is the end of your regime and of all your crimes. In Jesus name! God has put an end to your regime.
So? What are the demads? Poor journalism and CLICKBAIT! To say the least!!! At least TELL US WHAT THESE CONDITIONS ARE!!!???
When Putin install Microsoft , Microsoft accepts terms and conditions.
Please lord let this 2 president  be cal m  and heal them god peace
he wants to end the invasion, prob he feels he's losing and want to save face.. .. 😂
Nato Started this war
Obvious frustrations and desperations of the tyrant. Let him go ahead .What conditions will change your primitive behaviour.
Sounds reasonable but the LUNATICS in the WEST are the unreasonable, Warmongering FILTH. THE UKRAINE AND BIDEN, TRUDEAU, MARKEL,UN, NATO ECT. ARE THE PROBLEM WITH OUR WORLD.
Pootin
If Russian people don't stand-up to Putin & remove him, it's WW3 💡 Если русские не выступят против Пути и не уберут его, это будет Третья мировая война.
Nobody can not stop this war untill the Russian President satisfied. We doing our best..just lift them.....
Is there a connection between President Putin and George Soros?
Gusto.makipagaway kasi alam mo.naman yan si Pres Putin ayaw pasakop.ay naku....huwag na kayo mangialam kawawa naman yung mga ordinaryo mga tao...ayaw nga nila sa.western idealogy.
Who will be next. Stop war.
Gas gos up in my area over 4$ gallon
Putin is war criminal and terorist,I would not any more sit or talk to Putin.I think whe shut react as Nato and face the confrontation.And end his regime...
Ukraine: Withdraw your troops and halt the invasion or suffer the consequences...how are those conditions?
Thx for actually not telling us what those demands are , very informative video 😌
Wtf is this, the journalist just repeated stuff for 4 minutes
Who gives a damn what 'conditions' the man sets. Putin is like a crazy neighbor who says you can't be friends with the other people on your block. Then he burns down your buildings on your property and says: 'If you are my friend and not their friend, I'll go away'. Would you call Putin crazy? Or, creepy? Tell him to shove it up his ....
This tells me nothing.
See what happens to your country in 6 months of those  sanctions.
Putin won’t stop retreating is not an option for him he will not be humiliated and made too look weak like Biden is
Now the ball is in Zelensy's court. He needs to decide if he wants his civilians to fight and die? Or to save all of them and with diplomacy have peaceful connections with both Russia and the West!
He should also rebuild Ukraine. This was an attack not operation. Putin is a liar.
I don’t understand any of this, the worlds a fucked up place of do as I say when I say how I say or else. By everyone people walking down the street to the corporation’s powering the street lamps on the fucking road everything is a fucked scam if do as I say or else and I consider that so much bullshit we all live underneath the pretense
Russia or Putin should move out of Ukraine unconditionally out of Crimea completely,  denounce ever entering Ukrsine, before any talks with any one if Macron should desist , he is only talking to Putin to crown him king of Western Europe.  Selfish ambition.
Here's our demands  The Russians pull all their troops out of Ukraine and  they take them back to Russia and then we'll lift the sanctions but only then
Damage has been done, both parties should know these conditions before the WAR start yet there's No Positive response, in the end.. no matter what choice they made today and onwards, the lost lives will never comeback.
And those demands are???
Amazing how all ALL the so called news medias never bother to mention the "real truth" behind this war! They portray Russia as being weak, if Russia is anything, it's certainly not weak! And Putin is just trying to secure Russia from being attacked and infiltrated by the fascist EU. Putin already bombed eight US run Bio-labs in the Ukraine! The same type of labs that were in China that created the past 6-7 global viruses! Ukraine is run by idiots or traitors if they think they will prosper by rejecting joining Russia for the EU and NATO. Joining NATO and the EU would literally be surrendering unto satan and they're too ignorant to even realize that! America is saturated by the EU's fascist elite's grasp, our institutions are ALL corrupted, FDA, EPA, AMA, Medical Industry, Pharmaceutical Industry, our schools and colleges, EVERYTHING! They literally poison us using mainstream TV news and medias, even public broadcasting! and they poison our children's minds and bodies at the supermarkets and in the schools! They have sent us into wars for their benefit only, they have used America as a leverage tool to gain control of other countries, they control the IMF and the banking and money systems of the world, they are "the Beast System" God warned us about in the bible! and they in are literally in everything! And they hate anyone who doesn't surrender their sovereignty unto their control, and Putin's Russia is one country that have rejected them and succeeded in throwing them out of their country entirely by whatever means necessary!
Families wiped out, innocent civilians coping the brunt of this. Where is the humanity, Ukrainians should not capture these animals firing on civilians, then allowing them to phone their families. When captured, SHOOT THEM.
It's like saying we will not invade your country if you let us invade it
What a joke Natoe and the EU is !
The actual  day will come when you will have your say then.
So what are Russia's demands then? What kind of reporting is this?
If you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord and believe in your heart the Father raised Him from the dead you will be saved. Romans 10:9
Putin's determination is determination.
Simple leave Ukraine or watch your army die!
So what are the demands!?!?! WORST news reporter EVER !
Jesus Christ called people everywhere to repent, therefore, if you confess with your lips the Lord Jesus and believe with all your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved and inherit the Kingdom of Heaven and eternal life. told other people how good he is, how he saves, heals and liberates and gives eternal life
This is stupid from his part.
Putin  is the agressor ,he must stop the fighting!  ukraine is only defending it's territory and thats their right,and they did'nt do anything wrong. .Russia did invade ukraine, and they need to get out from their as sson as possible! Putin now needs  to shot up his mouth, because he is  has been lying from the beginning.
If the comedian president was smart he would sign this tonight.
Three minutes if intense reporting,.. and the world still doesn't know what his demands are.   Because he HAS no demands.  Great reporting,.. clickbait.
God speed for saving everyone and the world.
Stop using the word invasion & lying to the people all over  the world.  This was provoked & caused by USA & Soros not President Putin
Unless you can tell us what Moscow's Demands are, this is a waste if diskspace and time.
Just one bullshit in putin head and this mindless murder and mayhem stops
lol
Hand over the seat of tempreri president of Ukraine for 6months above jialencki seat to the Unsc president in  till time situations fix.
They don't want to say what the demands are because it would make Russia look good, all they want is for that NATO not to put missiles on their borders and not to have NATO bases in the eastern bloc nations, and not put puppet governments in countries near Russia that will and are bombing people in areas where  people with Russian ethnicity are, and the war crimes there committed by the Ukrainians is hardly ever reported for some reason and when it is it's reported like it is ok. We would most certainly demand the same if the issue was reversed remember the Cuben missile crises 1962 "The bay of the pigs". Not that I'm for the Russians but it isn't worth going to WW3 over, at least the Soviets didn't think so when they backed down in 1962.
Ukraine's not going to be Russia Putin you know that your wasting your time
yup
i hope this can put an end to this pointless war
I know what they are so the fighting is going to continue for now Putin still needs to hit some marijuana it'll do him alot of good and hit it hard
Everything except what conditions? More unreasonable demands?
Nonesense
Putin's condition must be fair to both nations, if no agreement to ceasefire will be achieved
Putin's condition: He will govern Ukraine.
What a useless report.
"World is one"  really ?
Doubt it's going to end
I didn't hear of any conditions on this video other than Ukrain stop fighting...anyone?
Ok but what were the demands..
a murder want to stop murdering with condition??????
This man is evil
wow. this was useless news
All of this is again because of usa
Putin is a Satan
You can trust putin with his words . Let putin end the war first. Before peace negotiations begin.
and if you believe Putin,.. I have a bridge I can sell you.
No to war
Why Ukraine is so hell-bent and adamant on joining NATO can't it just live happily as a neutral country. NATO was formed against Russia and so it will reasonably be concerning if someone so close joins it . Try to look at the bigger picture and I think America is the biggest culprit
Finally president Erdoghan  Steps In to find a solution for it The Legend  Much love and respect for Our herO  Recyep Tuyeb Erdoghan here from paris France
Thanks mr.pres.putin 🙏🙏🙏we hope the end of war in Ukraine ..pls leave nato troops in border Poland other country and us because us and nato convince Ukraine part of organization pls stop two # terrorist us and nato
Anyone else just wanna know the "conditions"?
No judgment, but if someone broke into your home, killed a few members of your family, and told you he will stop doing it if you to give up all your weapons, give him  2/3 of your income, and he will live in one of the rooms and control the doors, and yes, make sure you do not call the police as well.. oh.. yes.. sorry.. he was your best friend whos' family was saved by your grandfather and you also gave him back your most powerful guns years ago ... got the parallel?
I advise that Putin's demands are met and the West take full responsibility for the cause of the start of this war. He basically was provoked and if the Ukrainian people can not remember the history of Russia for millennia freed them from oppresses. They are one people. Must he wait to be invaded first. When you are truthful you will admit it. You can see that he is shocked that they do not see his intentions. He do not want to fight the people but the government. Do you think he will go to this extreme for the fun of it! PLEASE! !!!
END THE WAR FIGHTHING AND KILLING INOCENT PEOPLE FOR WHAT GOD LET IT BE PEACE
Dinow abdalla
I might have to put a stop to this
Putin must go! Путин должен уйти!! Putin dolzhen uyti!!
The nerve of this psychopath putin; he invades and attacks a peaceful sovereign nation and then makes demands. putin is an evil murderous thug and must be stopped!
Zelenskyy is connected to Schwab, and other elites with evil globalist agenda  ... just letting you know...
No soon nato will get involved then watch.They said usa wouldn't  get involved  in balkins then they did 😉  soon Ukraine will get polish jets Ukraine knows how to fly them migs
Over 6.8 million refugees from the Syrian conflict…
Moscow never had any demands, only Putin does have demands. And if the demands are met Ukraine gets Putin's word to not attack them again, and that's not worth much since Putin's army have already attacked Ukraine in a few other occasions before this war.
Hindsight is 20-20. Where are the Nukes going to fly? China? India? United Arab Emirates? Imagine a world ruled by them, if shit hits the fan...
He won’t stop if they meet conditions
Lady sorry to sound rude but PLEASE learn to speak English!! We can't understand a word you're saying!! Please
Putin's Demands :::  I kill you, and take everything you own.  OR...OR,  you give me everything you own, and I slave you.  Now People of Ukraine!  I can't be fairer than that can I !!!
You cant negotiate  with terrorists
*Wow! Some people really are stupid! I've been reading some of these comments, and it's obvious that people have no idea what they're talking about!* *The reason Ukraine wanted to join NATO, is because of EXACTLY WHAT RUSSIA JUST DID TO THEM RIGHT NOW! Russia doesn't want them to join NATO so they have no real protection!* *Russia wants them to accept the fact that Russia claims Crimea! And Russia wants them to recognize Donetsk and Luhansk as separatist regions! Meaning they really belong to Russia!* *Donetsk and Luhansk were part of Ukraine until Russia filled them with rebels and armed them so they could fight against the rest of Ukraine! Russia is the real aggressor here!*
How about Turkey’s invasion and illegal occupation of Cyprus. Does Erdogan think that’s unacceptable as well or is he just a hypocrite?
Russia unleash  its terror on its unprovoked citizens how could you expect them to bear the brunt of ur bullets without.self defense You stop.first then  they don,t need to fight to defend themselves
Hope they agree on something. Erdoğan  I appreciate your efforts
Ok what are the conditions
Will Russia stop fighting if China attacking them first?
Just a thought,  what are the conditions?
That's the dumbest thing I've heard on the internet today 👀😂 , if they get peace they won't have to fight , don't fight then we give you peace he says? what tha fuk is this logic 👀😂
Kiev is not going to surrender to moscow.
Haven't told about Moscow demand s.........
This tragedy and terrorist attacks on the United States and Europe are the result of a mistake made 43 years ago by the United States and England and France  against the Shah of Iran, Islamic governments grew and China and Russia became stronger
Idiotic reporting.
A great mansion with gigantic landmass awaits Putin in Hell...# he tremors the whole world with his evil mind and soul
United Nations .....HMmmmmmm
Enough is enough Putin. Just because your lover was killed at the Cock farm and the Ukrainians control the Cock farm. You have no right to take your anger out on the whole country. Your 20yrs with loverboy Boris Smirnoff (air ti the vodka empire) is amazing to say the least. Go home and calm down.
Shit on russia flag, colture,.........
Putin's downfall is near!
Consider where your soul will spend eternity, heaven or hell.  You don’t want to end up in hell because you rejected the Sacrifice Jesus has made all who repent and turn to him by faith.  We are all guilty of sin.  We lie, steal and look with lust in our hearts.  We are all Guilty before a Holy and Righteous God.  GOD is not just all loving and overlook your sin.  He is loving, but sin He will Judge because He is Perfectly good. The Good news is God the Father sent His Son Jesus Christ who was perfectly Holy to pay the penalty for your and my sin out of Love for us.  We can’t keep the Law we break most all commandments.  But Jesus fulfilled ALL by his perfect thoughts, words, deeds and motives for us because we could not. Jesus loved all humans and God the Father perfectly.  Turn, repent of your sin and confess Your thankfulness for what Jesus did for you.  Put your faith in the perfection and the righteousness of Christ.  Jesus was raised from death to give you new life; death has been defeated. Out of love and grace eternal life is promised to those who have faith.                                                                                        ,/.,,/.,/.                                                       ,.//.,./,/.,/./.,        ,/., /., /    /.,/.,   ./,
what are moscows demand? so vague. And news we already knew moscow wants Ukraine to stop their pursuit to become a EU member state, simple
We'll only stop invading you if you stop fighting and agree to everything we want including being under our control. Also known as surrender, this guy knows how to bargain....
The coward is now looking for wày out.  His days are numbered.
Come on world war 3
the condition for peace is you  Putin step down  because you will loose this war ,you have 28,000  foreign fighters that have joined the Ukraine army and more coming and you have over 14 countries supply arms to the Ukraine army  hand held stingers by the thousands that will knock your planes and copters out of the sky and now fighter jets will be given to the Ukraine armed forces and soon nato will step in and you know what we have nukes to and subs  ,peace talks off the table and i understand your inner circle and the rich of  Russia what you out and there is a price on your head and its getting bigger my the day until someone takes it , and your daughter is in hiding in German  what a joke
You never said what the Russian demands were so I think you’re completely lying and that the title was pure clickbait.
Nothing said. Just more money for wion... more views equals more money.  Useless minutes waisted on no information whatsoever.
Is that a pakistani or indian accent?
Take a look at Putin:   THIS is socialism!
Putin The  bully Thug of the century! .don't be distracted by "smart talks". He doesn’t fight  the war but forces  his young conscripts to do  the dirty work to die for zero reason. Good to save face using other people:s lives? Let say Putin likes eating steaks but would do the slaughtering himself,  Hides behind nuclear weapons like a cornered desperate killer prepared to take everyone to kingdom come if any nations dare to stop him... no limitations!. Karma is his terminator.
Putin fighting for the security of his country.
Putin name is garbage
WION has grown from a small news media to a trusted and unbiased global news media.  When I first watched their news, it’s like I was the only one here, but I can say it has grown beyond expectation in a short time. 🍻🍾
This is just a president's vision I think you should let him if you don't want to lead us into ww3
What a jerk. Ukraine isn't the one that drew first blood. He doesn't realize where he's sitting with egg on his face & he isn't as big a man as he thinks he is & even his own people don't have any respect for him
So Russia will declare a ceasefire if Ukraine surrenders ????? What sort of 'condition' is that? Its utterly ridiculous. The conflict will continue and sanctions will increase.  Finland and Sweden will join Nato and there will be a massive increase in Nato forces right along Natos Eastern border. The Russian economy will tank and no Mediterranean holidays for Russians. How is that a success for Russia again - more threatened after attacking Ukraine than it was before?
Putin = LIAR.
the Ukrainian Nazi group AZOV killed 14,000 people in Donbas in 8 years!  Who are Ukraine’s far-right Azov regiment? The far-right neo-Nazi group has expanded to become part of Ukraine’s armed forces, a street militia and a political party. killers of neo-Nazis and Bandera in Ukraine , who have been killing people in the Donbass for 8 years! The Kyiv regime killed 14,000 civilians in Donbass in eight years, including hundreds of children !  Ukraine is ruled - by neo-Nazis and Benderites - who use the power of Ukraine, use the children of women and the elderly as human shields.  The government of Ukraine should take power into their own hands, it will be easier to negotiate with you than with this gang of drug addicts and neo-Nazis who rule in Kyiv and took the power of the country and the entire Ukrainian people under their control. For 8 years, neo-Nazis have been killing people in the Donbass, killing children - who were hiding in basements without electricity, without water, without food - BECAUSE the Ukrainian authorities completely blocked the city like fascists!  all of Europe knew and allowed and kept silent Ukraine to kill people in the Donbass, for 8 years Putin asked to stop this war in which people are dying, but the Ukrainian government continued to kill people - including citizens of Russia - who live in Donbass..The world overslept and looked away during eight years of terror, violence, and genocide.Citizens of Ukraine do not understand why the government is allowed to hang Bandera on the building of a state institution, who during the war of 1941 killed and raped people. This is horror!  This is the same as if in modern Berlin a portrait of Hitler was hung on the Reichstag.  Ukraine has gone crazy for a long time, this country will have a sad future and the most sad end.  The Ukrainian government itself will destroy its state by glorifying Bаndera and neo-Nazis! If someone thinks that the gigantic portrait of Bandera that hangs on a building in Ternopil is a private matter of Ukraine, then you are deeply mistaken!  Nazism and fascism is not a private matter of any particular country, it is a real threat to the whole world!  If a country allows it, it is a shame and contempt for such a country. half of ucrainian  voted for the political neo-Nazi party AZOV - which governs Ukraine, who have been killing people in the Donbas for 8 years along with MERCENES from European countries. Where are those for whom they voted now ?? where is the president of their country?  why did he run away from the country and hide behind the backs of European politicians - who supported the neo-Nazis who killed the civilian population of Donbass!  where are the oligarchs of this country who left the people in the country????  why more than half of the people voted for the party of neo-Nazis and Bandera in Ukraine?  Putin called on all of them to start negotiations and stop the war in the Donbass, among which were both Ukrainians and a citizen of Russia. The people themselves chose such a government because of which they are now suffering!  And also Europe supported these murders - they sold weapons to neo-Nazis!  Neo-Nazis are destroying the Russian language and destroying everyone who does not support them. The people of Donbass did not support the fascist regime of the Ukrainian government - they were killed for this. Neo-Nazis and Bandera people are glorified in the country, monuments are erected to them, portraits of the fascists, Stepan BANDERA and Roman Shchukhevych, are installed on buildings in cities  Ukraine!  This is a shame for all of Europe, which allowed the glorification of the Nazis and parades in Ukraine
There is a price in every condition.
Zelenskyy has been a naughty j.
One condition only....  Terminate Putin
Time for Russian Generals place Putin under State detention & prosecute for war crimes if confirmed that he targeted civilians.
We agree with Putin. Let us know the history between Ukraine and Russia.
Piss poor reporting. Tell Pootin' to shove his "cease fire" up his ass!
Putin's demands are that zelensky has to fist bump him unlike erdogan 0:38
Putin wants the Ukraine to give up so he can installed Russian style government in Ukraine .that is what Putin want
Nothing will ever be the same for Russia for Ukraine. So many have died. Putin can't bring peace back to the world. He deserves nothing. Theirs no way he can think he can put conditions he is the aggressor.
Putin is the Stalin of today. And, being a classic dictator, Putin has always wanted to expand his empire, and as an ex KGB officer, he wants Russia to regain the former Soviet territory and beyond.  Putin got infuriated with Ukraine learning towards the West. Putin's war on Ukraine is very personal. Obsessive Love from Russia. It’s a revenge act similar to what’d be done by a country bumpkin guy whose childhood sweetheart left him for a smart-looking city guy. Putin is a man full of jealousy and vengeance. Jealousy can make a guy crazy and even suicidal. A suicidal mad man could do anything just like a mass shooting terrorist. So, yes, it’s quite possible for him to resort to nukes.  Moreover, Putin is really a coward though he’s desperately tried to look otherwise. Putin shamelessly told brave Ukrainian men to stop hiding behind human shields of women and children, but it’s Putin that is a despicable coward hiding in safety behind the overwhelming military power of Russia. The fact that Putin is a timid dictator is clearly shown by the way he uses ridiculously long tables even when he talks with his subordinates. But, as shown on a recent vid, it’s totally different when he’s surrounded by women. A despicable coward, indeed!  In response to a no-fly zone over Ukraine urged by Zelenskyy, Putin said, “Any movement in this direction will be considered by us as participation in an armed conflict by that country.” This is a very provocative statement against the West, but it’s a provocation to see how far he can go in his plan of expansion. If he judges the West is spineless and powerless to stop him, his next target may well be Poland or the Baltic countries (new NATO members). NATO surely is in a Catch 22 or a hostage situation.  Just like cancer, Hitler surely should have been stopped at an earlier stage, and Putin should be too. But alas! There’s a drastic difference : Nukes! Technological developments can be a curse. A nation of booze-heads elected/entrusted a psycho with nuke-heads.
Maybe the conditions should be that Russia stop violating maritime boundaries in the Canadian Archipelago as well as those in Crimea this is outrageous. I suppose the Inuit are gangsters occupying Russia also. All due respect to his de facto allies in the United Nations China, India, and the United Arab Emirates this "military operation" is too ambitious, not to exaggerate, their leaders should plead to a Putin that is currently as imbalanced as Kim Jong Un
The sanctions is fuel for russians people to get brave and start killing putin. Its easier to say than done but anything is possible.
Russia is trash and they know it
I pray God is listen to our us that may a peace ,and stop war.
What demands?
I am not listening to any news from now unless the headnline  Putin Aceept Terms
Nah, that’s not reasonable at all.
who will stop fighting first？Is the invaders or aggressor or attackers？or the one merely defending the attacks？nonsense if the country being attacked should not stop first！！！！！Russia must first to back out！and stop firing....
Mr. Putin Sir 🙏😔 Please be sure your soldiers don't hurt Children. I beg you on my knees  for the Children MERCY 🙏  UCRANIA PLEASE GIVE UP ! WHITE FLAG TO STOP THE FIRE NOW
Poutine is saying submit...   Ukraine says again and I quote "Іди на хуй"
Long live russia🤗🤗🤗
Putin should not ask for their demand be met.. The world Should demand Russia withdraw .. All countries including India should stop sitting on the fence and send a clear message to Putin !!
Its simple he is losing
You repeat a number of times, ".... if Moscow's demands are met"! Okay, so what are Moscow's demands? Don't you think your news is incomplete without listing them? It seems as if someone tells you what to tell and you do so, that is all and you, also, don't know what Moscow's demands are!
So what are the demands
End the war now
This video does not even list the demands. What is this wion?
Everything dime stollen from Africa during European colonisation shall be destroyed 😆 🤣
Is this an Indian chanel?
As Ukrainian living in us 20 years thank you to all world for support. Im impressed and surprised of how many Americans supported Ukraine by comments on all videos. I be very kind to them from now on even though i was good before. I didn’t know Americans have such feelings about Ukrainians. I guess I need chat, invite and talk to them more, I’ll help when you’ll need me and never pass by person in need.
What about the refugee crisis created by iraq invasion and Syria crisis
What are the demands!?
So what are the conditions?
Anybody else notice Putin go for a fist bump at 0:40!!
Make a written pledge that Ukraine will not join NATO and the issue is resolved.
"Please stop ✋".
Crimes everywhere in Ukraine...the man behind these must be arrested by the interpol and litigate to the Hague...ukraine president must file a case against Putin to the international court...so that he will be arrested and end this unreasonable murder againt the civilian of Ukraine...that's the solution...attack the head and the body will paralize...
Isa kang hunghang putin...!
Peace matters peace lives"
Shooting civilians to stop them escaping is necessary I guess.  Probably to stop the need for humanitarian aid.  Get rid of Putin now. He's even attacking people on the streets in Russia.
This crisis in Ukraine is a distraction, wake up people. Is it a coincidence that after all these mandates are lifted now there's a war. There is something going on behind the scenes and I guarantee it and I can bet it will not be in the people's favor. Receive the Lord as your Lord and Savior, Repent and be born again. Things are speeding up, were in the middle of birth pangs. Jesus Christ is coming!!
how about "NO"
Screw Putin's demands! Get out unconditionally!
Putin should only be allowed to accept conditions not make them
Wow thank you for the “news”🤡
I bet not paying for the damages is one if them
Make the Uke POWs strip n spin. Neo Nazis always tatt. Let their ink tell the story. How US prisons separate gangsters.
It’s like a hostage situation, “I’ll kill people until I get what I want”  Can’t a sniper take him out 🤷🏼‍♀️
Putler is done. He "sets" no conditions. Just bla bla. He will be gone to hell in short time.
I hope this invasion will be ended very SOON because it will be everyone is bast interest including Russia.
what are the demands
Get a cease fire but no matter what send more weapons don’t believe Putin.
Stop o te bej varin o sor rip
Why the fighting
As punishment for the invasion NATO must demand Russia not only return Crimea to Ukraine but recognize the sovereign power of Crimea under the Ukrainian Democratic Government, refusing any solidarity toward Russia in the United Nations as a rogue state not only occupying Ukraine but Crimea
The bully lays out his conditions n we obey him???? He kills people n says it's not war; we "disciplined" him n he sets conditions for us to obey.N he calls these disciplinary actions war
W/O GOD. WE. CAN. NOT. BE.// WITH  GOD. ALL. IS. POSSIBLE.//
Do your will God bind the evil and protect your people stop the violence and ty in advance Jesus .. bless and protect and provide
Glory to 🇷🇺🇮🇳
what a useless video. what are the demands? can you do your actual job ffs. wasted 2 minutes for nothing
Hahaha this braking news was literally no news and then she said let me repeat 😅😅😅😅😅
BS clickbait. Nothing is said here.
Surrender the war ENDS...Simple.
War is not solution. Stop war . Lakhs of common people are real sufferers . Thousands lost lives already. Putin ignited war first but not Ukraine
Hitler wanted the Russians to put down their arms too.
no deal.
Nothing said
This is news?
Let’s Pray for Peace
Most cows demand
We pray for Peace to stop this war between Ukraine and Russia
How about the as President Biden said dictator in Moscow going into the Hague for war crimes and breaking the United Nations Charter.
Criminals don’t get to set conditions. Maybe he can cop a plea to save his life, but we’ll let the Ukrainians decide on that.
LONG LIFE TO RUSSIA WHO DONT WORK FOR THE GLOBALIST LIKE MOST COUNTRY DO
Hahahaha lumabot din pala ang p+@&#+! Alam nya na matuynaw ang Russia
The Turks as peacemakers. What could go wrong?🧕
Getting smelly
Basically, russia is saying - Ukraine must surrender and fall under russian rule... That demand is fkcing sick ! He really thinks that Ukraine will surrender now, after they went thru so far? Really? He is sick !
Too much pootin in Ukraine
Peace should have been considered before the war... not after..
NO CONDITIONS, PUTIN!! GET OUT OF UKRAINE AND RESIGN!! YOU WILL BE TRIED FOR WAR CRIMES!!!
Ukraine to stop fighting? DIdnt Putin start the war first? lol.
What are Russia demands?
the condition is you get out or the things will be worse and worse for you. Get out Putin. Go away its your fault
Why would any nations leadership send it's people out to die..... very disturbing in our time on Earth... I am just saying... everything is worldwide now ...it's just a disgusting display and misuse and abuse of power and leadership...
Just give him what he wants so we can move on
This will end very very soon
Purim’s closest friends will kill him, nothing new in Russia. Unfortunately he will drag many innocent people with him and Russian economy to.
What are Moscows demands?
Putin can write his conditions on a piece of paper and shove it up his azs.
Very good...
Is there really coming back from what Russia did wouldn't it be really akward in future meetings lol
Russian police and army should just go in and arrest putin , he's only one man hurting a lot of innocent folks for absolutely no reason . I don't know how a police sargent or army general can sit back and let these things happen I wouldn't I Don't care  if it was my president or not I would never ! Follow such criminal actions.
What are the conditions from Moscow?
Putin thinks the west is retarded. No one is laying down weapons. We've seen them break two ceasefires. If Ukraine stops fighting, they'll get steamrolled.
Putin is in no position to demand anything.  The Ukrainians with some help from the west are whooping Putin’s army ass.
WION is a pro-Indian funded channel by Goverment of India. 🖕🏽🇮🇳
russia should compansate that.
Voice is annoying
What are the demands????
Thank you Putin for showing the world that you can never be trusted again.
I don’t believe nothing he says !!!
Ukraine to stop shelling Eastern Ukraine. That's the main demand. Eastern Ukraine people have the right to Govern themselves without being shelled by Western Ukraine for the past 7 years just because the despot Ukraine Government doesn't like the people governing them selves.
if russia doesn’t stop soon, i might have to intervene, and let me tell u, putin doesn’t want me to intervene…
Repeating nothing over and over!
Whats are the demands? Insane reporter
There were no demands from Russia They attacked under the guise of a special military operation.
We need to put it in writing that Ukraine is to never be admitted into NATO.
1. don't listen to what Putin said 2. Keep going  3. don't give up  4. Putin must go to the jail 5. everyone hates to Putin 6. dosen't matter block to Russia  7. we are fine to live
What's his/Moscow's demands?!!! Come on!!!
Click bait
No conditions Putin must go if not send him to hell with nukes
The only condition Putin will get is either give up or burn him with all nukes
Not way. Erdogan and Putin go to hell
I think they are going to respond “NUTS”…
Bravo putin!!
The very basic was: ZELENSKY would like to be a puppet of the allies. That's the first reason why this aggression begun. and infact Russia will give ukriane an independent status. we all can't blame Putin for all of these..
So??? What are the demands???????????????????????
Ukraine it's full of NEO-NAZI  pay fron USA
As long as there are governments there will be war's
Who started this war in the first place? He should stop and leave I think 🤦🏾‍♂️
they should learn how Vietnamese kicked American ass back to USA.
well now that i know less than ever it is understandable why the russian people haven't a clue what is happening.
So..."Unconditional Surrender".  Why would Ukraine do that?
We are gonna wish we had stayed out of this one 🇺🇸
This two minute video could have been ten seconds, since it's just repeating itself over and over...  and it doesn't even answer the question of what Putin's "conditions" are, besides "stop fighting."  Why does this video exist?  It's just a waste of everyone's time.  I clicked this, because I thought it was going to say what Putin's conditions are.
so it's actually a threat for Ukraine to make them not joining NATO and EU
I hope President Putin should widraw Russian troops from Ukraine and defeat the economic sanctions by using your vast oil and gas deposit as a diplomatic weapon. Also President Putin, your thousands of nuclear weapons at Russia arsenal is enough to guarantee to give security to your country even for a thousand years. You dont even need a security treaty or guarantee from NATO or Western countries. The west and NATO will not dare to occupy even 1 sq meter of Russia territory.
putin is acting as if the world will vow to his demands. without those missiles, his army would be crushed instantly.
Russia firstly invaded Ukraine but now wants Ukraine to stop fighting & meet their conditions. How unfair is life?
Yeah but the demands are unreasonable and not even within the Ukraine's power to comply with. Many of the demands involve members of NATO that Russia get veto power over allowing new NATO members and that members joining after 1997 are not allowed NATO weapons or equipment.
Lol this was breaking news. Who is the genius that runs this media outlet. Half of the world knows what Putin wants. Thanks for the breaking news genius
this channel is from india but no body knows and its trending 2 in Us haha goood going WION
WHAT ARE THE REQUIREMENTS BRUHHHHH
His got to go....
Dollar reason he’s talking to Turkey nobody else will talk to him I think the party’s over turkey is only good for Thanksgiving lol
We know what Putin wants he wants Ukraine to surrender to him.  The Ukraine people do not want to be under a dictatorship, They want to be a free country.  That is never going to do for Putin.  Who says Russia gets to make demands and get their way?  What about what Ukraine wants?  All they want is for Putin to pull his troops out and leave them alone.
putin seems delusional
It’s such a shame to see India’s stand on this war
Wasted 2 mins of my life for the sake of poor journalism..
What are Putin's demands? You didn't even tell us what his demands are!
I would argue that these demands were the actual reason behind the Invasion to begin with double points if they could actually take Ukraine.
What conditions Hitler 2 wants.
Hurry up Ukraine just go with Russia 🇷🇺 don’t  be a hero to the wrong cause
Please come & blow up Canada
He better do that. Otherwise he will seen as Hitler 2. Cannot understand why such a big country wants to attack other countries.
I'm guessing Putin condition is to own Ukraine 😳?🤷
Free cyprus
why are you scared from Putin ? Joe Biden don't listen to Putin what he said , Putin is almost done and dosen't matter Russia Gas, oil, etc,, black to Russia now /putin is knew that after war what he'll go to the jail. so Putin going to be crazy so don't listen we are more strong and more powerful
Hoping
BS. We should had never given them the help by allowing them to generate money with the oil. Oh and this is the exact same play book of other Russian ploys. Stupid is all I can say to this crap.
Where is the Pope's condemnation of this killing of innocent people , How is this still happening in the modern world, This world inhabited with Humans that are Evil  need to be rooted out and the only way is to stand with the lord our God but how do go about doing this .that is the struggle, Those who threaten nuclear weapons of war is no short of suicidal and to have this power in the hands of a few to destroy our civilization is utterly insanity, God has given us a  earth to live and love and make life so much better that would be so much easier for all of us , The scriptures say the lord will intervene at the end days and man will eventually destroy the world and I pray for mankind and Heaven will be taken the believers in our lord Jesus Christ, Praise God Amen
You stand for a globalist world! Really
The Invasion In Witch He Said Is Not Invasion That Obviously Is Invasion Because He Is Liar
err? what were those conditions again?
Since syria not ww2. You know americas illegal war.
How about all of the politicians go fight in a ring and fight like real men
Why is he afraid if Ukraine joins NATO?.. also, Ukraine is a sovereign/free country.. it's the Ukrainians  prerogative if they opt to join the alliance whose only goal is to defend democratic nations from unreasonable invasion from tyrant/bully/ungodly leaders of usually communist governments.. as what is happening now... Also, Putin is going to lose face if the Ukrainians will emerge victorious in this senseless war , so he seems to agree in ending the invasion but still insists on his demands...?.. lives were lost,  essential buildings/ properties were destroyed/damaged.. the Ukraine should demand also for payment from him.. (although he can't give back the lives of Ukrainians and even his own  soldiers who died).. so hopefully, this war ends sooner... God bless us all...
0:39 Putin wanted a fist bump 🤣
Ya what are the demands ? ????
The most evil person alive today
The demand is to take controlof Ukraine
Those of us old enough to remember the Cuban Missile Crises knows exactly what Moscow is asking for. This act by NATO is just in reverse order
Whatever side the evil and corrupt Bush family, the Clinton Family, the Obama Family, and the Biden family are on I for one will be on the opposing side. Go Putin!
All this because the US once again went back on its word not to spread nato! They have never honor anything, so now people are suffering for it!
WTF ARE THE CONDITION??!!!!!!!!
Mother Russia
So, give up your homeland and let us take it over, basically like the  U.S.S.R, seems sensible enough - rolls eyes.
First condition.....stop letting US use Ukraine for illegal tax laundering fraud  and illegally making bioweapons in US funded bio labs. Second condition....arrest the US government crime families.
🥺😔😳
Ladies and gentlemen, this is what a derailed man looks like. Wladi you joined the elite-club of people who have blood on their hands of innocent people. Now you can with Obama, Bush and the rest of the criminals against humanity sit down at the same table and drink black coffee like a coal. A tak ogólnie, to pies cię jebał.
the ottaman turks...please do justice.
I want a nuclear war
"We'll stop when I get what I want".  Hmmm, No.
Your demands is like the most stupid demands you can say surrender or die but the fact is Russian soldiers are dying too soviet vs soviet at the end of the day the families of those Russian soldiers will angy and hate you and they are the one who will kill and I'm waiting for that day and the world will celebrate the death of the evil of the 21st century
Putin doesn’t get to set conditions, he’s a modern day Hitler. The worlds powers will de throne that dick-tator.
This has been caused by the expansion of Nato towards Russias borders, something they were assured wouldn't happen. I don't agree with Russia attacking Ukraine though and as usual, the people on both sides suffer. This feud should have been settled years ago but politicians don't value life. We will never know the exacts truths as all media is biased towards the governments who pull their strings.
No more condition...if you want problem go continue what you wants...if you want peace so it be make it...no condition the people of ukraine will only suffer that so called condition...
Why bring this shit up if you guys have no idea what the demands are.
Ukraine is not going to lay down their arms and let Russia take over the country.   That is absurd condition by Putin.  And also while this conflict is going on by Russia, Sanctions are not going to be dropped by US and NATO.
JUST END IT PLEASE
Go go turkey for peace . The integrity of Mosco is far beyond compare for lack of any agenda of malice to both sides.
Time to send Oprah in to settle this once and for all.....................
ASSASINATE PUTIN
Are kids also fighting???? He has killed families trying to flee away from the war... Whyyy Putin why... Stop this nonsense
Petrol prices are rising. My two cars run on petrol. I'm a common civilian from india and I have to sell both off at a loss if petrol prices continue to rise up. Stop this war 4 god's sake ! It's affecting everyone of us in the world, civilians who have nothing to do with conflict.
Us has caused this war by propping up Ukraine giving them money to go against Russia and wanted them join NATO and EU Biden wants his kickback so do Democrat congressman  negotiate to end war
These sanctions are punishing us. If we opened the keystone pipeline, we wouldn't be paying high fuel prices
Putin's conditions, surrender or die. He just wants to take control of all the countries that are not part of NATO. Ukraine wouldn't have joined NATO anyway, it takes time to be part of NATO. Putin will take control of other countries, he wouldn't risk any of them joining NATO.
He's acting like Hitler taking the, Sudetenland, do you honestly believe he'll stop?  Putin is stuck in the last century.  His own people must remove him to prevent a World War🌻🌻🌻🌻🌻🌻🌻🌻🌻
This was a waste of time,, this is not the time for " Clickbait ".
Wion uses these attention-getting headlines then tells us nothing.
It is known when war starts but not when it ends. Putin is desperate and panicking by this war, there are in store special treatments waiting for him.
What are Russia's conditions?
Russia is doing the right thing for Russia and shall not talk with western clowns such as nikky haley, antoni blinken, Volodymyr Zelenskyy etc which are just  distractions.
You left out the most important part, the CONDITIONS?
Russia is doing very well because they deserve it, Ukrainian government is so stupid because they are just following USA which is not good for them
Shoot to kill
He will never stop
AMERICA and NATO  invading many countries  and give tention of other nation like turkey  if not NATO member. they expand there empire!!! wake up people!!!!
Diplomacy & negociation are the key words to stop the war.
My solidarity with Ukrainian stopped when started racism against black students in Ukraine let Putin invade till the end
The only acceptable condition is that Russia withdraw all their forces and pay reparations to Ukraine.
This is war between Russia and NATO.  Use of advanced tech and hardware is deployed by both parties.  It's a very good chance for India to study the tech and hardware for developing it's tech and hardware.
Clickbait garbage link.
We don't need no russ-invasion. We don't need no bear control. No more attacks on innocent people. Putin leave Ukraine alone.  Hey! Putin!  Leave Ukraine alone. All in all, you're just a-nother prick in a war.  My apologies to Pink Floyd.
Lmao.. they want Ukraine first to stop fighting as a 1st condition!?!!? 🥴🥴Uhm.., then STOP attacking so they didn’t have to fight or fight back! Only goes to show Putin is nothing more than a butthurt President who’s throwing tantrums for not getting what he wants.  😂
its not an invasion ! its just an incursion you media hacks .
With all the damages done Ukraine cities, I want Ukraine to bomb Some cities of Russia with jets so that Putin will feel the pain of lost.
reported
These Indian presenters are very beautiful 😍
So, in other words, the world has to do Russia's bidding, before they will stop murdering people. Putin is the leader of Russia, and nowhere else. It will take a hard lesson for him to learn this reality. I worry how far he is willing to go in his hubris.
WHAT ARE THE DEMANDSS
makes sense
So tell me WTF Russia's demands actually are.
What are the demands beside Ukraine stop fighting? No info this video sucks!
Moscow's demands should be met with revolution.
How do you walk Into someone’s home and just demand shit??
READ ME!!! IMPORTANT!!!  The end is near!! Will you wait until it is too late? Have you ever thought of what would happen to you today if you were to die? Are you sure you're going to heaven if you die? How can you be sure?   The most important things we need to point out is that the only way to heaven  is through Jesus Christ and being saved by his grace.  What does it mean to be saved?   To be saved means you have been delivered from the penalty of your sins, which is eternal death to enjoy and live in the presence of God forever        1. We are ALL sinners by nature and choice.   Romans 3:10 KJV  "As it is written, There is none Righteous, no not one."   Romans 3:23 KJV  "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;"   2. The penalty for sin is death.   Romans 6:23 KJV "For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord."    The "death" mentioned in this verse refers to Spiritual death which means HELL.   Wow!! The wages or payment for sin is death? How can I get to heaven then?   3. We receive eternal life as a free gift!   According to Romans 6:23 it is through the gift of God which is Eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.     But why would he give us a gift of eternal life? It is because He loves each one of us and wants us to live with Him in heaven.   4. God demonstrated His love for us  Take a look:  Romans 5:8 KJV But God Commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.   Ok, that helps to answer ‘why’ ?   Now the question is what must I do to be saved?    5. Admit that you are a sinner, you cannot save yourself from death and hell, believe Jesus Christ died on the Cross for you and rose up on the third day, accept Him in your heart as your Lord and Savior    Romans 10:9&10 (9)That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.   (10) For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.    God’s Word teaches us that if you simply and sincerely believe in your innermost being that Jesus  took your place and died on the cross for the payment of your sins, and that God raised him from the dead on the third day (found in Matthew 28: 1 to 20)you will be saved by your confession of being a sinner and asking the Lord Jesus to forgive you of your sins. Because we are not righteous (none of us are), the only way to heaven is to ask God to forgive you of your sins through believing prayer.     Romans 10:13 KJV For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.   If you call upon Him for salvation God promises to hear you and you will be saved!!  Go to God in prayer and sincerely pray a prayer like the one below and mean it in your heart:  Dear God, I confess I am a sinner and cannot save myself from hell. I ask for forgiveness of my sins. I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God who died on the Cross for my sins. I accept Jesus Christ in my heart as my Lord and Savior. Thank you for the forgiveness and thr gift of eternal life. In Jesus’ Name, Amen.  If you have prayed this prayer and truly meant it in your heart , God’s Word assures you that you now have eternal life.    *Eternal life means going to Heaven when you die   See John 6:37 and John 10: 27-29
So Putin will stop raping if you stop fighting him?  How does that make any sense?
Do NOT trust Russia.  And China.  EVER.  They are both untrustworthy.
Conditions = CONTROL
Surrender is the demand.
What are Moscow's demands?
And Moscow demands are?
Erase his face from the media. We don't want to see it. Erase him!
What are the demands?
I have only one condition: POS putin does a rapid nose dive down the nearest toilet.
I believe they are these:  Not joining NATO Never be allowed to join NATO No no fly zone Full demilitarisation (so they can walk in an take over the next week).  What a farce
Putin and his entourage are worthy of the death penalty for terrorism against the Russians for twenty years. because of the threats of his supporters, I had to flee the country. it's a pity that I can't get them to punish!
Putin: "I'll stop invading if you let me invade."
They’re not sanctions they are special economic conditions, bro.
CLICK BAIT ALERT!........................The demands are not mentioned at all.
I don't believe he'll stop even if they do that.. he lied about ceasefire so his word means nothing. He keeps breaking agreements.
So what is the conditions.... ?
I would go ahead and nuclear bomb Russia. They will do us anyways. His 'pudin' way of ruling is annihilation of everyone that's not with him in his way of thinking or actions. Why drag out suffering and pain of watching any human suffering, just go ahead and drop one or send one his way. Get it done and over with if that's the way its going .  Quit dicking around and do it already. All the bullshit of power and " if you interfere, we will make war on you" crap is chicken crap pudin boots! Do we honestly think that U.S is going to stand by and be told what to do and what not to do? If we interfere? We have no day folks. So might as well say let's bomb em. Let's take them out with us. Just like the hero's of flight 93. They could not let their hijacked plane reach its target, so what did they do, even knowing that it was still a death sentence to each of them . Death if we do, death if we don't. Least we will hurt them first and or kill the leaders .  I don't want to die. I don't want to see and hear anyone hurting or suffering. I don't want our way of life to be for nothing. I don't want to see my mom, dad, brother sister friends family and strangers dying in our arms. Hell no. But who am i? A nobody . Just a grain of sand on an endless beach  to the government. Thousands of  people who have loved ones are going through that right now because of pudin n boots! Being cut down, blown up in pieces. Those are the lucky ones if you want to call that lucky. In this day and age how can the people have acquired a leader who is a pile of shit and power hungry? Do they vote like we do in U.S?  Why hell would his army go for this slaughter ? What hell. I'm just sick and angry at my self that I don't have superpowers to shoot down pudin myself. A miracle would be The Good Lord sees fit to strike that monster in Sheeps  clothing down where he's hiding under his rock!
Can we have president vs president boxing matches instead of wars ? It’ll be best for everyone and loser has to post a embarrassing photo on twitter🤷🏻‍♀️
BECAUSE ITS A PLOY. HE HAS NO DEMAND EXCEPT REUNITE THE OLD RUSSIA OF 19 FORGOTTEN. BURN USA WHILE ENJOYING WEST PRODUCTS. SIMPLY LUNATIC OF GREED OF POWER & WEALTH
Putin called the President of Turkey because the President of Turkey is holding the best cards, the strongest hand.  Turkey is holding an Ace high royal flush. Putin's navy is all stuck inside of the Black Sea and the only way in and out of the Black Sea is by going through Turkish territory.  The Turkish President CLOSED Turkey's water to all Russian naval vessels and now none of the Russian naval vessels can get out, plus the ones that are out at sea cannot get back into the Russian naval bases on the Black Sea to resupply as they run out of food and fuel.       The Turkish President told Putin I will not open the Strait to let your ships pass in or out until after you first pull out of Ukraine.
To summarize: give us everything we've been killing you for.  I hope Ukraine tells them to get fucked and bleeds Russia dry.
Breaking News! Russia don’t give a shit! About your peace talks and sanctions as long as there demands are met end of story.
Rubbish reporting. What are the demands ?
Putin will be taken out, by his own people; his, Inner Circle, and those who want to prevent a World War.
Putin wants Ukrane to stop fighting for their freedom, and he was the one who ordered the invation, what kind of Insanity  is that?
YOU CAN NEVER BELIEVE HIS WORDS. 10 HAS BEEN SAID, 11 ARE LIES. DEATH TO THIS BEAST IS PEACE ON EARTH!
Someone in Putin's inner circle needs to take him out ASAP!!! Blow Vlad up in his bunker, taking Lavrov with him.
Why would anyone believe him it when he said he wasn't going to invade then ended up doing it anyway unless the media is lying about what really happened
For sure, his first demand is - NEVER JOIN NATO  click like if you agree 👍
RUSSIA HAS BEEN PUSHED TOO FAR......THE STUPIDITY OF NATO/ USA WILL ONLY BE STOPPED BY A NUCLEAR WAR !!!
Ukrainian president should be trialled for genocide for killing his population from western interference. Poor people die because of this idiot agenda dictated by EU and USA
When shit happens over seas, I'll pay attention to their news if I want the facts. Not some garbage here at home to push a false narrative. Next
Was looking for what the conditions mean but ok
Don’t trust him
Stop war please
There is a diagnosed group of people who bully thier way into others boundaries, see others as extensions of themselves and they are called "narcissists". Didn't know it was a putin thing, thought it was solely American 🤣
Ukraine have legal right to bring Putin to International Court Of Justice in  Hague as War Criminal Charge.
NATO and EU are trators
Wion is a breath of fresh air. I wish it would cover the atrocities committed  against Biafrans by Nigerian government. The Biafran leader, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu was forcefully kidnapped, not extradition, in Kenya airport by agents of Nigerian government in June 2021 to stand trial for agitating for the independence of his people. Even the amiable Indian president spoke about the condition of Biafrans last month.
I'm expecting that as a state under Russia, that Ukraine will be less corrupt, and its standard of living will improve.
No one can trust Putin, don't be fooled by him.  He has been a liar, saying he will not attack Ukraine, yet he did. He is evil, he carries out indiscriminate destruction of Ukraine's civilian infrastructures, killing thousands of Ukrainians, sending millions more into other countries as refugees, causing hunger and untold misery to the innocent Ukrainian people.
Clickbait. Lame. Not really news. We knew that from the start.
I hate putin
And this will be the last click bait. Down vote and don't recommend channel.  Hitting that algorithm hard.
Ukrainr just do it so no more people will die for this nonsense war.
He will not stop he will keep all he occupied he will lie lie denigh  he can not be trusted opinion
Bullshit the syrian and general middle east flood with African refugees is the greatest.
Those are not conditions for a settlement, those are conditions for a Ukrainian unconditional surrender.  Of course Russia wants Ukraine to stop fighting and to meet its demands.  Fight on my Ukrainian brothers and sisters in Christ and allies, do not let this evil demon Putin and his minions take over your children, homes, lives, your freedom and liberty.  Fight for God and country.  Our rosary prayers are with you everyday.  Even in the afterlife meet with the Angel of the Lord and fight on with your own flaming sword.  Long live God's fighters!
I hate him and I’m not even from Russia
Russia  has travel a fine line.  but needs water  an I get that part.  first thing Russia  did was blow up that dam  that cut off water a Russian city of 2 million people.     be careful Russia.   don't paint urself into a corner.
Me temo que Adolfo Putin llegó demasiado lejos matando indiscriminadamente a civiles y ya no le aceptarán ninguna condiciones. El está acabado, así nos acabemos casi todos.
Only the pope can stop this war, the prophecy say's. if know one knows. strong message to the world. check SDA
'Heads I win, tails you lose!
conditions: ukraine gives up. lol. okayputin
I think at this point Putin has no leverage left.  It is in the best interest of the world to completely destroy Russia's economy, just like it was done in the 90's.  This will weaken the "bear" far more than any military confrontation.  Remember,  banks stop tanks.
putin doesmt fear sanctioms becz he isnt like xixingping who wants to make russia the super power...  so nthing is going to happen with all these sanctions
One of the most "Un-informational " videos i seen so far.
Putin should pay for reconstruction of Ukraine and pay compo to Ukraine families
Both parties/nations should reconcile in order to restore the standards and quality of life amongst its people, that needs cooperation to one another, employment, agriculture, horticulture, manufacturing and preservation of their respective topography, landscape and architectural designs known to the rest of the world.
in other words, putin is getting his ass kicked and he wants out.
Just shows the true colors of a paranoid, delusional and narcissistic dictator and bully not only to Ukraine   but to the whole human race. To him, his demands are the only reasonable and justified thing in this world. What a hardline communist/autocrat who does not belong to this era but to antiquated world. He is the number one and ultimate Terrorist in the world because he has no qualms to destroy a sovereign country and  annihilate humankind with nuclear just to satisfy his ego. This man should be stopped and put to justice.
So what are the demands
Putin And Biden GOTTA TO GO
Why would he demand Ukraine to stop fighting when he is the aggressor?😂😂😂 Russia stops fighting, the war stops.
Can’t believe anything coming out of hitlerputin mouth, but you have to try to shut this down, America did not want Russian missiles in Cuba and almost ended the world 🌎, Putin wants a buffer zone, he wants all Ukraine 🇺🇦 but if everyone can get stingers and javelins deep into Ukraine to the troops they could take out a thousand tanks, hi flying jets they can not hit , must find a off ramp to slow this killing down
Good decision by Putin 😎👌❤️👍👌🔥
What r the demands??
That's not a "condition" that's a basic War tactic.
What are the demands?
Russia will March in the Western countries until the Devine Intervention will happen,,,
Fist bump unsuccessful😂😂
Why doesn't this lady shut up her blabbering and list the demands?
Putin is a madman not unlike Hitler.
0:55 the left guy hold it upside-down :D
I'm still waiting for his demands, care to elaborate??? Lmao
It’s not going to end till Putin is removed
No! The war must go on!!
I hate to see Ukraine’s people suffered because of the US allies expansion and poor leadership of Ukraine’s President and not knowing Putin’s reason of securing Russia and Ukraine.
Ah so Putin’s conditions are to listen to his conditions staring into the barrel of his gun. Totally fair
Russia has been very consistent with its demand that NATO not to be creeping on its doorstep since 1987. A demand that has been ignored by NATO and accumulated into a brink of WW3.
We need to take note that bidin is not a very soft, nice guy as some people believe....We saw that he can be hard hearted with the decision he took on Afghanistan...all in his country's long term national interest..The people in Ukraine should know this and not play into the hands of the US...which may see the war as its long term strategy and national  interest..Is it not strange that the west is provoking a smaller country to take on its more powerful neighbour..knowing full well what the outcome would be ??..while not willing to give a helping hand .. besides some material and moral support.?? .It is not unlikely that the west would like the war to prolong..like in Vietnam ...to wear down its perceived enemy
NATO should invade Moscow to put put in on is knees
"If Moscow demands are met"? And "if Ukraine stops fighting"? First of all,  you started the fight, so you need to stop fighting. The Ukraine people are only responding to your aggressions. What kind of demands do you have for that free nation to feel obligated to you? Putin is autocratic lunatic that seems to be losing his mind.
Not on Psychotic demands
Lol if they stop fighting then he'll just take over
And what are de moscov demands, after destroying cities and kiling civilians???
Fucking piece of shit socalled news repeats that Putin set conditions and repeats he set conditions a dozen times stating not one single condition.  Now that is reporting.
putin is crazy. what demand is that?  that Ukraine stop fighting and what?  lie down play dead or roll out the sign, welcome russia!? that it?
World should find methods to remove this criminal. Killing innocent people doesn't solve the conflict.
Video is useless, what are the demands?
Accept Putin's conditions if there's an immediate ceasefire and a UN monitored Russian referendum is conducted. The UN will take control of Russian State media and provide background, video footage of the invasion and ask the Russian people to agree to Putin's terms OR Putin resigns, Ukraine's independence confirmed, Crimea included!
It will prevent humans from murdering one another in the future. Ukraine should put an end to the strife and give Russia control of the nation. Fight another day. Ukraine's president is employing. People serve as a shield. And said, "Fight for the country." Why? sending them to die. Russians are killing civilians because they perceive them to be a danger. It is more crucial that Ukraine end the conflict. That. People survive Ukraine Insane president.
he is taking aborting his troops so he can drop a nuke
Russia, China, and the USA do not have the right to bully  and control smaller countries.
Yeah,  lets negotiate with a terrorist.
CAN ANYONE BELIEVE AN EX KGB AGENT ? I THINK NOT, NOT UNTIL HE IS GONE FROM OFFICE.
And what are the fucking demands? Idiot reporters broadcasting even though they themselves don't have the answer
Where’s Putin’s lackey Modi?
People Don't seem to realize that ***(ISRAEL)***, still has NOT Publicly Condemned PUTIN, for Invading Ukraine!  Look it up.  Why is no one talking about this on the News???  PUTIN has single handled made DEMOCRACY look BETTER to the World, because of the Russian Fascism and Communism Invasion!  So THANK you PUTIN for this.😜  PUTIN = CRAZY = HITLER!   Look at the History books at how HITLER started by Invading POLAND.  The World will now see that Putin is truly (EVIL) because of him starting this UNPROVOKED WAR and INVASION. Remember that HITLER started like this!  Then Putin started talking about NUCLEAR weapons? Putin is EVIL, and Putin must be (ELIMINATED)!!!!   Do NOT blame the Russian PEOPLE for this War, this is Totally PUTIN war!  Remember, people DIDN'T speak up when (HITLER) was INVADING countries!   Think about it!
Stop Fighting, Raise the White Flag of Surrender, Surrender all your weapons, Pay restitution for all the jets, tanks and other items that Ukraine destroyed, Turn over the Ukraine Leaders for public execution, any demonstrators shall be shot on sight, and any other things that is decided for the sedition against Russian rule.
Can never trust and believe Putin.
What are the conditions then?
What are the demands?
I don't trust Russian retreat all your troops
What are his conditions ? He is evil and a murderer, killing innocent people for no reason at all except for his greed !!
It’s time to repent and believe in the lord Jesus Christ for the salvation of your souls! There is no other way into heaven but through him! All those who refuse to accept AND repent will not enter heaven but hell. Hell is for eternity and it is Hot! Take this warning seriously because your soul depends on it!
so what are those demands
Wasting your time he will not stop until the whole of Ukraine is gone..
Would be loyal and better than the slaughtern Russian aviation have done in syria
Thank you for this video.Showing spirit to a peaceful settlement.
What are Moscow's demands?
So, what are the conditions again?
They will stop the invasion if Ukraine stops fighting?? WTF?  Ukraine is only fighting cause they are invading. What kind of backwards logic is that?
Turkey will be invaded
Stop war president putin
Adolf Putin is like that bully who will no longer bully you if you stop showing your face to him. Fuhrer Putin strikes again

Wow
Putin just want to be another Hitler.
Dont believe anything Putin says. He has lied and lied before. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me. Dont believe him!
The world doesn't seem to care about shit or stopping this at all when in fact they do have the means and the power in which to do so. Get off ya fuckin asses
LOVE THE VLAD, get those Nazi Pedo's mate 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
Putin is a coward and fool
Wtf is this video? It says nothing
What conditions? All I saw were repetitive headlines.
Agree guys. Earlier the better or you will be responsible for worst.
A stupid report. Click bait even. No mention of what those demands and conditions are other than stop fighting.
Putin and Lukashenko are going to be bum buddies in Guantanamo Bay soon.
call his bluff, get Nato in the air
First time I have felt this Channel used click bait! On such a serious issue too. 👎
Ukraine wasn't fighting til you invaded.
VERY HOT Russian VODKA working out With Votka BARRELS.destroying  every think.
PUTIN GAVE STUPID DEALS. HE STARTED THE WAR , HE STOP THE INVASION SO UKRAINE DOES NOT NEED TO BE ON DEFENSIVE IF THERE IS NO OFFENSIVE FROM PUTIN,.
Hey Nato and U.N.!!! Charge Putin with war crimes and put a $30 million dollar bounty out for his head on a spike,  and this war will be over in less than 24 hrs.. I promise you!!!! I'll guarantee  my 14 million dollar portfolio if I'm not right!!!😆
What are the demands or am I the only one that doesn't know.
Moscow's invasion??? You mean Russian invasion!! Iam 😕
People don't expect peace from them, you have to go out and give up to Putin, NOW ! NOTHING MATTERS ANYMORE ! THERE ARE DEAD CHILDREN AROUND THE STREETS !!!
Clickbait 🤧
No one wants to be under the senile Russian sphere of influence, the breakup of the Soviet Union was enough proof of this
Well, that's not going to happen.  Pull your troops out, Putin, then Ukrainians can stop fighting. In ANY case you are washed up Vladimir Putin.
A. If Ukraine stops fighting, russias giving no evidence they’ll pull back.  B. Their demands are essentially no backlash from invading another country C. Nobody wants nuclear war but this war has proven Russia is a weak military outside of their nuclear arsenal. D. Putin faces war crimes regardless. There’s only one escape from that.
Doesn't  esy  putyn  come for  a couple punch with the opponent and  behemoth  stath  kill  all  this innocent citizens off ukrania people 🙄
Watching from Tharparkar District Pakistan
News you cant use
Putin always says something you want to hear then does something you dont want him to do. Goddamn you idiots. Hes been doing this for 40 years.
You don't negotiate with lying terrorists, you destroy them
THIS WONT BRING BACK THE CHILDRENS BLOOD SHED ALL OVER UKRAINE!!!  I just watched as Russian soldiers shot and killed a family in Ukraine trying to get back to the capital. The image is forever burned in to my head. She was still wearing her rain boots and lays DEAD beside her family😢
He is in no position to set conditions, Ukraine will be his undoing.
Good job erdogan
What are those conditions and demands by putin?
Russia a country that commits genocide in Europe and the Russians are proud of what they are doing. Putin used to be a good president, but now he's just a dictator
thy raiding taking robbing
I imagine the conditions would be something like give up your country and independence, no more ukraine, all russia 😂 Yeah like anyone would agree to that
Russia: "we'll stop attacking you if you stop defending yourself"
Putin cannot be trusted. Do not bow to that pig!
Ambitious people accumulate,amass,collect  Large amounts of monetary wealth, and along the way decide to exclude themselves from the human race. Not one proclaims peace, nor a path to better human existence instead the path they have CHOSEN, continue to attempt to return to the entropy from which we evolved. We cannot go back dinosaurs are gone, nobody can travel back to the past nor re-create it through some sort of delusional paranoia, caused by not understanding oneself. They come out make a mess if progress, maim and destroy only to die and leave survivors to pick up and move on. Hindsight is helpful yet look how easily one shallow mind forgets, that life does not go on forever when the entire opportunity to live is summed up in a big mistake as in this...we  need respond and ask questions for there might be a future in which we can live...
Zelensky is a coward, he has already left his country but bans his citizens from leaving to fight in frontline.
The European tribal war
Your headlines are a lie. What are the conditions.
Their special operations to stop Nazism not sanctions
thy want $$$$$$
Good, NATO is coming.....
Where was the energy when USA invaded Iraq
he started a war, now hes telling them to stop defending or he will continue.
The Ukrainians will automatically stop fighting right then and there if the Russians stops firing at them because the Ukrainians started responding in self defense if im not wrong.
Putin's mainly demands Ukraine to stop negotiations with NATO. For those that don't know NATO was created to stop the Soviet Union.
This is baseless news source.
A DICTATOR ALWAYS DEMAND AND MAKE CONDITIONS.  WHO HE TO MAKE THOSE DEMANDS?  IS HE THE PRESIDENT OF THE WORLD?
Save innocent end it ...  west need to think beyond business
North Kirea has nuclear weapons aimed at the USA and all the mainstream media can babble about is Russia 🤦‍♀️
I wouldn't hold my breath or believe anything this madman says. WE NEED TO GET RID OF PUTIN NOW!
If you pay close attention Putin was going for a fist bump, then switched to a handshake
It's just like saying, Ukraine just lie down and play dead.
We need more peacemakers . Peace, love and light 💕. Lets all  move on many are hurting due to pandemics ,and  now whats happening in Ukariane and Russia let's live peacefully and happily and healthy.
Never hard this news anywhere else. What nonsense is this that Putin agreed something with Turkish president? When and where. Be more specific.
Shame on American 🇺🇸 nato and eu for being double double standard
In history...."Politicians are voted in as Hope!" ......then becoming "Dictator"......after classed as  "Criminal" - this is the evolution of 90% of those who have disappeared. Mussolini, Hitler, Pol Pot, African Dictators .....the list is too long!. A wise man always quits while ahead - this takes guts to eliminate ambitions and drunken power !  Putin and his cronies will pass in history as a evil since they will never achieve their aims, since good governace is based upon "winning the hearts and minds of the people"......in Myanmar this shows today. where Aung San Suu Kyi suffered the same scenario as Ukraine.  Remove Putin at any cost!
R&d saali anchor.
God bless  🇷🇺  and good health to you Mr President Putin 💟
Putin can easily demand anything to stop his war of ignorance as he thinks he has the upperhand in all aspects and that Ukraine has nothing as their fire power is at the least. What if other countries provide Ukrainians with fire power at par with the Russians. Maybe Ukrainians might have their own voice again
I do not thrust Putin!!! This is Blackmail and Arrogance Talking!!!!. Why are  NATO, UN  and  US scared of this little man??? I know that they do want to start a WW 3, but with military power and special sporces surely, he can be taken as a prisoner/terroristwar criminal , , just like what happened with Saddam Hussein and Ayatolah Kohmeni?
Invasion??!! I call this WAR!!!
I'm curious if mr. putin would accept his own conditions if the roles were reversed? Its the equivalent of the abusive boyfriend beating the shit out of you and then telling you its your fault and he'll stop once you stop fighting and let him beat you up some more.
What are his demands? He doesn’t even know.
Is it me or was this video incredibly useless?!
Putin invades Ukraine and they fight back. So he offers to stop invading if they stop protecting themselves. That way he can take control with less blood shed. Anyone else think Putin has lost his friggen mind?
Down with Russia
I support both both but you can't say who is right rest the problem is USA and the EU countries they just misud ukrain
Why cant these old ass political people like putin 0putin sit home and watch Netflix like we all do. he really wants to invade and destroy millions of people lives eh .
Take him out. Period!
Putin's offer is pretty good. If Ukraine stops using their civilians to fight America's Cold War with Russia, Russia will stop the invasion.
I hope one of Russia's conditions is for Ukraine to stop killing its own people in Donbas region 🙏🏻🙏🏻🛐
"Resistance is mine🇺🇦!"  - sayeth the Lord🧔✝️!
This information is so vague! Are you reporters just lazy or what? WHAT ARE THE DEMANDS FROM PUTIN? Did they change? Is he still asking for Ukraine to be neutral and that's it? He isn't going to allow NATO and the US to park on his Russian border, so, I'm assuming that's what he still wants. But I shouldn't have to be the reporter! Do your job.
Nothing will stop him.
stop the war guys
What are the demands?
You NEVER stated Russia's demands.
P
Think Trump wanted to pull out of Nato and why did he meet with Un along to upset China, does anyone know.
More like conditions to quit feeding Russians into a meat grinder. Russian troops are abandoning equipment and trying to make off in cars. They run out of fuel and food.
How bout putain steps down and turns him self in to stay alive other wise we will come get him but no way in witch he stays a power in russia not after this wreak less abuse of power and needless killing to feed a ego it can't be allowed to continue nor go um punished he is mistaking NATO's kindness and overall want to avoid war and more death as a weakness what makes him think that his demands have any bearing I think he is lucky that we evened allowed him to State any demands he should stop thinking he is in a position of power and start making decisions and moves that can help him to stay alive you just do not get to make several completely unjustified nuclear threats to the world and expect for those threats to be unanswered and unacknowledged at least in my opinion and I know with the Right leader in America this s*** here would not be happening the way that it is Putin knows that America knows that and I fully believe that
Putin's demand is Russia shall stop fighting if Ukraine stops fighting? Confusing; How do you stop fighting when your aggressor continues fighting?
Erdogan is very clever. His country soft support Putin being against any sactions to Russia yet  in media they sound like they are in NATOs side.
And his demands on establishing a new leader pro Russian and the country as hole laying down their arms. 🤣😂🤣lol ok let's give our country away and live the rest of our lives on our knees..lol
NATO caused this, (Western Europeans AND slo JoE Biden’s, Amerikkka), they need to fix it NOT Turkey
Ukraine can not join nato.  Thats like canada joining russia. Putin is not going to allow it and we shouldnt try it. Its common sense what doesnt everyone understand.  We need fo stay out of it and put America First.
How can ukraine stop fighting when russia keeps bombing them! Time for russians to dispose of pootin
If they are all restricted by NATO's legistation and Ukraine not being a part of it, then WHY there is still no ad hoc military coalition on behalf of the UN, (for example - since Ukraine IS a part of it and such coalitions are nothing new, like they do it to keep Africa peaceful)?!
...yup. Putin will continue murdering people, unless those people capitulate to his demands. Tucker Carlson is telling us that this is what we do.
Putin's mind is truly incomprehensible and unpredictable. He only wants Ukraine to stop fighting. He is the invader and aggressor, so if he stops fighting, the war stops and Ukraine stops defending itself.
Ukraine will STOP fighting when there aren't any Russians THERE trying to take their country and trying  to kill them.   How about if Russia agrees to stop , by leaving Ukraine alone.
Hitler Putin is a LIAR. He always lies. You can never believe anything that he says. History has proven that!
Is that the only outfit she owns?
I don’t believe it
Sounds like Russian BULLSHIT to me.
Regardless of the outcome of this war, Russia has lost big time either way. It’s economy will pretty much be nonexistent. Putin needs both 1) Ukraine and 2) a functional economy in order to carry out his future plans. The way things are going, it is clear that he won’t end up having both. So, what’s the point of this?
news anchor is HOT
Putin sounds confusing and threatening. He is going for the small fish in Eastern Europe, US is a fish too big, he might choke on it. Bring the man plenty of vodka 😀
Putin the Aggressor is setting conditions???
An escape from the crisis requires a vision for a better future Putin was led to believe the Ukrainian government would pack up and run. Rather a poor judgment call considering the Mayor of Kiev was a Hall of Fame boxer, and his look-alike brother, the Klitschko brothers are not the type to run under any circumstance. Added to this, the president of Ukraine is a master at theatrics, has rallied the entire country. Putin sees he can not win the war unless he annihilates the Ukrainian population, and even then it could go either way. And NATO could supply Ukraine with short range missiles which are directed by satellite data. These weapons in the hands of a determined population would wipe out his entire army and air-force. If Putin backs out, members of the Azov Brigade a small white supremacist, Nazi group, which is integrated into the Ukrainian army, will become national heroes. Is there any way out?   A well financed international peace zone in the Crimea and the Donbass which will be a go-to zone for world leading bio-scientists, a silicon valley with a strong bio-engineering focus would win Putin if he properly sold on the future of bio-science. As a precondition for these regions to be brainstorming centers, they will allow the people to live freely. An open border for Ukrainians and Russians is a must for the flow of new ideas. An internationally monitored Donbass and Crimea will not be subject to autocratic rule. Taxes would be split between Ukraine and Russia. A government would be comprised of Ukrainian, Russian and international representatives. These areas would attract the best minds in the world, it would have a positive influence on Russia and Ukraine.  Following the Hong Kong model there will be a 100 year break from including Ukraine in NATO. That may seem a long time, but considering cellular senescence will be reversed well within these 100 years, it should not be considered an imposition to either party. If it does it’s job properly, most likely NATO won’t even exist in 100 years. Recently Charlie Johnson, from Penn State has been able to mimic a dog’s nose using graphene and pieces of DNA. His Enose achieved a 92% detection rate with Covid and a 95% detection rate with ovarian cancers. Dogs have been trained to smell out almost any disease, this new technology will soon be able to do much, much, better. It will tell who around you is infected and how far away from them you should be such that your immune system is triggered but not overloaded. At this stage the technology can fit under a bed. We have designed smart-beds, and have built and tested smart-pads. For seniors who have trouble with incontinence, it will trigger an alarm, waking them or notifying an attendant before they soil their diaper. As the AI develops, when you wake up in the morning an exercise program will be designed for you, along with instructions on food, supplements, and pharma. As olfactory technology becomes smaller we will place this tech in smart-wear, smart phones, and even smart watches. This tech-wear will be a must-have for athletes and military personnel who will be able to micro-manage their supplements, food, and exercise. People, by following the guidance of this tech will live healthier and longer lives. Olfactory tech can be integrated with other diagnostic tools already used in smart-wear, smart-watches, smart-rings. Smart-textiles are also an emerging field.
Thats pure BS , if only NATO will help Ukraine 💯 they can easily defeat Putin the A hol….
Russia needs the Romanovs back on the throne.. please stop the Madness.. please pass this on...
UCRANIA PLEASE GIVE UP TO PUTIN ! YOU CAN STOP THE FIRE !
RUSSIAN MILITAR is week  disable to CONQUER the  UKRAINE....... RUSSIAN IS WEAK
That man😡Putin need to be taken out  This is pure evil,heart breaking God bless Ukraine 🙏 from uk
What are the conditions exactly?? Although I'm quite sure we will never get a straight answer from ANY media outlet.. God forbid the truth escapes...
And what is his demands?lol
Poor sad putin cat
Dear people of Russia.  What you are experiencing is the rest of the world spanking you for the actions of your lying, corrupt president Putin. Sorry you have to suffer because of him.
Just a small slice of Ukraine 🇺🇦 and how civilized they are: 4.1.1 An article published by the New Republic journal in June 2014 stated: ‘In the first decade of Ukrainian independence, the Donbas had the highest level of criminal activity in all of Ukraine. Between 1990 and 1993, total crime in the Donetsk region increased by 50 percent. In 1991 alone, the Donetsk police department fingered 2,186 criminal groups, which at that time had committed over 4,000 alleged crimes, including 33 murders, 212 robberies, 173 cases of extortion, and so on. Since 1991, the number of organized criminal groups identified by law enforcement agencies has increased steadily.’1 4.1.2 In November 2014 the Elite Daily reported: ‘Organized crime has been intricately involved in the Ukraine crisis from the very beginning. From the start, local gangsters have been at the center of the violence and the money. Moreover, organized crime groups are also looking to profit off Russian development funds flowing into Crimea through both fraud and embezzlement. This year alone, the funds coming in could amount to $4.5 billion. What’s more, organized crime groups around the world also stand to gain from the chaotic situation.’2
What are the fucking demands?
Dear gawd, Russian soldiers have sent prayers asking you to help them defeat (KILL) the enemy but are out numbered by people praying to you to kill the Russian soldiers so what's it to be dude. Your'e an expert at killing the ones you claim to love. Would it be possible to have another great flood without drowning the rest of the world?...I mean hey! that's where the money comes from and satan will be pissed having to burn up seven billion  bodies without somewhere to buy enough oil. I'm glad I'm not in your shoes.....decisions, decisions man 😐☹
To sum up, Pootin wants Ukraine to give up everything without a fight so that he could move right in and have complete control.  If not, he’ll continue to destroy Ukraine until he gets what he wants.   Yes, this is year 2022, and a dictator is making  such demands.
Putin is scared.  He know if the fighting continues; more and more of the world will turn against Russia.  The west needs to call his bluff.  This is so reminiscent of the Second would war when allies should have faced up to Hitler.  Hitler bullied his way to get appeasement just like Putin.   It would not be World War III because Putin would back down and if he is crazy enough to try to fight the rest of the world; he will fail.   Putin will never use nuclear weapons because he know it will cause the analyzation of Russia and his generals will not go along.
So how did the US use Ukraine?Just asking.
Additional demand from Ukrainian n the world. Putin should step down n tried for war crimes
Russia was asked  Why not join NATO. Russia reply  - No vetoe
No one can meet Putin’s demand. Putin needs to be gone for peace to work.
Russia: "We'll stop fighting if you just surrender and do as we say"
You invade others country and start attacking, destroying and killing their people, and now you demand to stop resisting and fighting and you will stop the war, first place you start the war and now you demand and telling that the ukraine fault because they are defending their country?what a bunch of idiots
If those demands are met...all Rogue states ..like North Korea n.China will know what they can do also...btw Ukranian should continue fighting.. Russian should withdraw..first..n its demand that erodes Ukranian soverignity should not be in rhe table..Its time Putin is thought a lesson ..his imagine threats are his delusions...
Well guess Putin owns Turkey now.
Time for the world to stop buying Chinese goods also.
What are the conditions?  Your headline is very misleading.
them chillin and talking while ppl are dying out there
I just checked in to see what condition my condition is in
Can,t wait to see this guy go down
It's an Indian channel so can't expect much
Yes..but What are the demands..... control of the Ukraine
America and NATO countries are responsible for war
We get that Putin will halt the invasion if his demands are met. What are they?
Russia: "stop making friends with countries who would protect you if I ever decided to beat you up and take over your government, or I'll beat you up and take over your government."
So Russians conditions are Moscow conditions?
Click bait BS!!!  Down with Putin!!!
Eukraine unacceptable terms…..continue fighting till PUTIN IS KILLED.
So….Putin will stop the war he started if the Ukrainian’s stop resisting? wtf
There are "others" waiting, watching us very closely. I know this for a fact. Enough said.
Folks! What Putin saying this , I am robbing your house right now, don’t fight back and just give me whatever I want. Duhhh…😂🤣
Hmm if only we knew what those demands are
The only downside to this is that it will soon allow Russia to recuperate and strike back and then fully conquer Ukraine.
Mr. Putin Sir 🙏😔 Please be sure your soldiers don't hurt Children. I beg you on my knees  for the Children MERCY 🙏  UCRANIA PLEASE GIVE UP ! WHITE FLAG TO STOP THE FIRE NOW
If the Allies agree to all his demands, will there be anything to stop him from making more demands in the future?      Putin: " I give you my word ".
Russia is the aggressor so it should stop its aggression first before fighting can stop.
Down with the dictator Putler
Ukrainians don’t need your prayers.  They need gone to fight with.
What are Moscow's demands?
putin has upper hand b4  and during the war. ukraine has to see itself as neutral neither going west or east. do business with both. zelensky has too much business connect with west. leaning on eu nato
Are the interests of ALL American politicians being protected in Ukraine?
the egoistic fool comedian zelensky will not stop because he doesn't care the civilian to get killed
Hey WION!! You just did that thing which cheap channels do!! And, that is not what we have come to know Palki Sharma, for the serious and credible journo that she is!!  You click-baited us!!  What are those "demands"?  Plus, you did one more thing that "cheap" channels do. You played that video on an endless loop!  Look...get back to your real standards, or else, before long you will become "WIONdeTV" or "WION-now"
I don't care about Ukraine.  What about the drugs and illegals at our border? What about the covid narrative disappearing? What about the USA suffering from $4 a gallon gasoline and hyper inflation?
Please understand that Putan is not going to stop after taking over Ukraine, he needs to be stopped now and the best way to do that would be to have the Russian people overthrow their government.
I pray for everyone that lost their lives in this senseless war and peace for not just ukraine but the entire world. This has gotten me shook and so sad.
Yeah right he see that he is on the losing hand now he makew suggestions for agreement like it will be that easy to get in peace again with Ukraine after all he did to them
Putin is a little scary rat
So?  Stop fighting and just die and they might quit? What a piece of crap.
You are correct Mr Putin.
Doesn't make any sense
The problem here is that erdogan  is nearly as fascistic as putin
Humility on both sides. It's a start. Then let's start getting rid of the nukes. Poison gas was barely used in WW II. Rid us.of bio weapons also. Let us all become adults.
Putin is locked in a war  now he wants a way out
Mr Putin Ukrainian & Russian are slovic brothers war between 2 nations is just not right.peace on earth God bless
In the interest of Ukranians and the world in general, it is time ukrain and the west listened to Putin and accept conditions that are essential for Russia's safety ; more the delay, more suffering for the Ukrainians' and the western alliance can no longer enforce its mandate due to the changing world order and Russia being a formidable nuclear power ;  the x comedian Zelensky and the would be comedian Boris Johnson could exchange places for a change !  Earlier Imran Khan showed solidarity with Putin when his leadership is in question with his backside on fire and now Erdogan is talking of peace, keeping his own people in captivity and his country on the verge of bankruptcy !
papa pu looks happy
They are bombing people who are running to the exits  ! "Stops fighting" ?? Sick pig !
Knock down twin towers and London if Biden come around you
condition is stop the NATO.
Gr8 b8 m8 I r8 8/8
Why is this titled Moscow’s
sooo... putin: give us ukraine. zelenskyy: no putin: invades zelenskyy: resists putin: ok im ready to negotiate. give us ukraine. zelenskyy: no
Fastest growing refuge crisis LMAO
Moscow's demands is taking  away the freedom of Ukrainians.
what a crock of shit!
All you did was loop some vague text about 3 times. What a stupid video.
Moscow's demands at last report are: 1. The full disarmament of Ukraine. 2. Ukraine pledge to not stand up an army and agree to fall under the military umbrella of russia. 3. Moscow picks the individuals who will stand for election in Ukraine.  These demands are laughable, it means Ukraine is a province of russia.  Even the leaders, what is the point of elections if all candidates standing for election are puppets of moscow?  Moscow is copying from Beijing, Ukraine will be Xinjiang v2.0.
If Biden and NATO agreed before,  the attack and lives of ukranians could have been avoided and we wouldnt have to pay 4$ a galon of gas
this no condition it surrender
Didn't hear anything about these conditions in the real news.
Thing  is Putin is a liar, so he cannot be trusted.  ✝️😎✝️
Obviously, after all the deaths and carnage, the world citizens have to set the conditions for engaging with Russia after Putin has been handed over to Western Authorities.
NATO Special Forces and Drones find  PUTIN and take him into custody. No more comment.
why ask for that kind of agreement for Ukraine not to fight back..it was Russia attacking the territory in the first place... must be russia to stop bombing and enterring others territory!
Putin is lying
one man kills another and goes to jail, another kills thousands and sets conditions
Putin demands he wants Ukraine to remain not a democracy country.  And not joining NATO.  Ukraine is going to be just like Taiwan. Sad I no😔Please remember Ukraine can still called there Democract  state.  NATO is out of the for Ukraine He. Doesn't want to Join NATO.  President Vladimir Putin threatening. Ukraine. Not to Join NATO
this guy is deiffinely a boss ,people fly to him ,he doesnt fly for othrs unless is buisness talk
What demands you are telling. Be specific!
Whatever Putin's demands are, Ukraine better accept them
Here’s to your conditions Putin 🖕🏻
Turkish Hava should patrol a humanitarian corridor and both countries should start peace ✌️ talks in Istanbul Turkey..where East meets West..
Just to collect views. Everyone please report spam or misleading to discourage shitty channels. I wish i could block spam channel in youtube

Ya ya, Russian invasion is not acceptable but the US invasion is acceptable, what kind of laws are that.
As if Putin cares about what a bankrupt country like Turkey has to say . The President of Turkey should care about his OWN lousy economy instead.
just   dry rusdia up food  money then go i  and  take putin out tgats what they are doing surrounding russia  its only a matrer of time before nato forces cross into   russia tb hey will not stop at the ukraine boarder   they  are waiting till russia  is at its weakest  thdn they will finish   it  they will not.let putin dtay in power nor will the.ppl of russia
Just a thought... people said.... Take him Out. Not order Take Out.
Putin cannot be trusted in anything he said. Believe him at your own peril. The only way to end the war is to sent him to St. Peter.
How many of these "condition sets" were made before the world wars? Crossing fingers whilst signing papers. Lock n load yanks!
Prime Minister Modi Should show his charismatic by meeting President Putin to put an end to the military operation in Ukraine
Lies, lies, lies!!!!!
Hello... What are Moscow demands?
Destroy Putin and the Democrap Marxists that are just like him.
Ukraines fault, just accept Russias term or get annihilated.
What are their demands? Terrible reporting!
Putin demands the whole world becomes part of the USSR
3.7m views in 10 hours. This is actually crazy
plz count me in to fight Russia... I'll volunteer
Wow!
No matter what happens the world can't let this dictator keep power in Russia... you have to take him out now.
UEFA BANK FIFA POLITIC NO RESPON TURKEY
He looks like he has some personality mental problems! He’s overcome some challenges not others! He likes killing people! That’s a flaw!
I would not Trust Russia or Their allies one bit.. Ukrainians Can Do As They Please!! No One Should Trust Putin... NO ONE SHOULD TRUST PUTIN... Ukraine Has A Right To want To Be Apart Of The Euopean Union and United Nations... WHO IS PUTIN THAT HE CAN TELL ANOTHER NATION WHAT TO DO!! Who Made Him Boss Of Another Nation... Even His Own People Don't Like Him and His Ruthless Behaviors. He Has Blood Dripping Of His Fingers... I don't Blame The People Of Russia For What Is Going On.. THEY ARE SO SCARED OF HIM!!.. It Like China.. it Like Muslims Country's... And The Rest Of The Communist Countrys.. Like North Korea... WHAT MAKES THEM SO SO CRUEL AND MEAN AGAINST THEIR OWN... MURDERING AND MAMING THEIR OWN CITIZENS LIKE THEY WERE DOGS... THEY ARE MENTLLY SICK TO THEIR CORE... THEY ARE NOT ONE BIT NORMAL AT ALL... SATAN IS USING THEM TO DESTORY WHAT GOD ALIMGHTY MENT FOR GOOD... GOD ALMIGHTY JUDGEMENT DAY IS COMING DOWN HARD ON THE UNBILIEVERS
Shit this Putin have to pay everything he was destroyed in ukrain .otherwise his country would face big revenge .
Peace brothers Peace. Let us channel our aggressions and violence into constructive actions such as working, dancing, massaging, doing art, cleaning, training, washing, kissing & making love via Love & Understanding.  Putin is not fkn around with us in the West. He told us straight & direct not to interfere with his military operation. Was hoping for peace albeit always stated not to underestimate Putin and his brand of nationalist authoritarianism via witch he Rules Russia. 2 days ago the biggest War of my generation ( LGBTQ Millennial ))) just started. What say ye ? What do we do ? My friend said in a grim rather dark tone : well, keep paying athletes millions, rappers millions, actors millions and the rest of North America divided, in debt, living from paycheck. to paycheck ...and then proceeded to rap somethings witch would rather not write due to being *( Age Restricted Matters) and finished how do you like that version of Freedom & Democracy....did reply that he had a rather cynical, pessimistic, negative and rather dark vision of North America *( and the West ) in the past years and today.... think he just needs a hug, a kiss, a massage and some love...what do you think ?   PS:  He also added something interesting to note of a more discerning intellectual manner ! He stated that Putin's nationalistic authoritarian ideology is very reactionary to the West's Liberal Politics of Pro-LGBTQ, Multiculturalism, Feminist and pop-culture ideology witch he views as having weakened the West and is morally degenerate.... claims that by analysis of Putin's own speeches and discourses that is a major part of his social, cultural, political and psychological ideological views and tendencies..... HAD to and WILL meditate on that....if even half of that is true....then we gotta go back to my first statement in summary : Putin is not fkn around with us in the West.  Support, join, bless & love the Dancing Goddess & Dragon  Kingdom for a New World Order of Peace, Justice, Insured Freedom and attaining Harmony between Civilization & Nature.  PS:  Make Love tonight !  Otwerwise wtf are we fighting for to save Civlization ?  Rich multimillionaires & billionaires ? wealthy artists ? rich athletes ? huh ?  and while you are at it  tell the Leaders of The Free World Dragon Zero's Message; Drop down and give Dragon Zero 13 pushups with Love & For World Peace.
Oh hell no, the world needs to arm Ukraine to the teeth and send blackwater etc to help Ukraine completely destroy all Russian military on the ground illegally in the Ukraine. This is possible. We are seeing first hand how ineffective Russian ground forces are. With the right backing, Ukraine could mash them up. In fact, if there was a no fly zone, Ukraine would have already destroyed Russia on the ground.
This is why they need to bring the dislike counter back. I want to know if a video is crap before I waste my time.
You care to share those demands?? That kept popping up in your video here
If you're reading this, keep safe, don't lose heart, and stay strong. 2022 can be endured with resilience. During these turbulent times there is still hope in the middle of the fear. There are good news, "For God so loved the world that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish, but have everlasting life" John 3:16. I just want to let everyone know that Jesus loves you with a passion more than you can imagine. He gave his life so you can be free and greatly cares for you. If you've got pain He's a pain taker If you feel lost He's a waymaker If you need freedom or saving  He's a prison shaking savior  If you're got chains  He's a chain breaker.  Don't let your heart be troubled. I wish everyone the best day
One  sided,,,,
Putin is worse type of human in planet…. Putin should have been put in his place a long time ago .
Why Putin had to set for Ukraine? It is NOT Ukraine that declare war; not the aggressor. It is PUTIN who invades, the rest of the world MUST stop Putin now. If Putin disappears, war ends soon.
This is in fact war of crude oil and gas, just think,  Why naftali meet Putin,  Why USA deal with Iran,
he s evil. i just seen a child lying dead in the street with her mother. he needs to be stopped
Russian demands must be met if you want to see this war end which I hope there is no other way.
Had to dislike this video because you never told us what Russia’s demands were.
russia has lost this war militarily and in public opinion.
What are the demand of President Vladimir Putin? If I'm President Zelinsky if the demand is still s surrender Ukraine from Russia it will not happened. Maybe possible if the demand is Ukraine should not apply as member of NATO. but to surrender Ukraine from Russia I think  Zelinsky will die for his mother country.
What are the demands ?
The conditions were 1) keep Ulraine out of NATO, 2) recognize the separatist provinces, 3) stop the nazification of Ukraine.
Surrender or ww3 that simple
If the fighting ends we'll have another covid variant :(
Be direct to the main point. Stop circling around.
Wow. This video is #3 Trending in the USA
What are the demands?
Stupid news.  It's the same conditions that Putin already set out which the West rejected, that's why he invaded Ukraine.
The world is full of busybodies.  That’s the problem.
Innocent people died because of what?? Just because he could. President Trump isn't in the Oval Office that's why.
So basically, they're demanding unconditional surrender... I'd tell Putin to go pound sand...
Vlad: I would noy have taken you for a coward with all of your macho BS.  But sending armed troops to bully women and children in Ukraine is not a good look for you.  And now to beat your own unarmed citizens?  Wow, what a little boy throwing a fit!
His position remains: give me what I want, or else.
Ukraine has proved they are racist. Putin claimed Ukraine the new Nazis, what I've seen on world news confirms this. Indians, Africans and the like are constantly pushed to the back of the line, because of the colour of Thier skin.  🇦🇺🤠
This is old footage WION. This footage is the COVID vaccine deal Putin did with Turkey months ago. False news eh.
Jesus Christ is Lord confess with your mouth that he is Lord get baptized put God first seek him with all your mind body and soul love your neighbors as yourself. Seek God while we still have time. Be blessed brothers and sisters
Putin knows he is loosing too much hardware and too many troops . Don't accept any conditions that make Ukraine  a servant of Russia . Putin is trying to win and also cut his losses . If you stop fighting  Russian troops might just keep moving or stay and occupy anyway .  Keep hammering them as this is the first sign of Putin weakening because his country is turning against him .  You have to take out that convoy stalled at the Teteriv  River .  It will be a massive blow to Putin . Surely there is some clandestine way to help take our Russian assets .
What are the demands? You are talking in circles.
It's always these short aggressive leaders you got to look out for...they always do the most to prove a point, and why on earth does he walk like that...like he's got diarrhea, and he's clinging his butt cheeks tightly together to stop any leakage.
Victory or death fuc off Putin you are a tyrant and an enemy of humanity. Surrender is not an option
Putin’s word means nothing, it holds absolutely zero worth. He’s not a leader, he’s a coward.
So, either give in to his demands, or BOMB Moscow!!
Interesting scenario... here's another. The Cat say's to the Mouse, 'Mr Mouse, why won't you come to my house for tea?' The Mouse replies, 'but you will eat me'. 'Oh no' say's the Cat. 'I'm a friendly cat, and I only wish good things upon all mice of the world. It's those other cats that have made me to be a bully, and crazed mouse catcher and eater.' 'So you won't eat me?' asks the mouse. 'You can trust me, everybody else does' says the deranged, grandiose and deluded Cat. Now in the real world of Mouse and Cat, what do you think happens next?
So what you're saying is, Putin will stop his assault, as long as the ukrainians surrender. * What is this place!
They'll quit if Moscow's demands are met.. oh.  What the hell does that mean?  Lol.  What a pathetic channel! 😆
if you want Ukraine put some of your people in the political circle next assonate the president of Ukraine next put the nation to a vote on joining back to Russia then fix the ballots  you win and Ukraine is yours
Thats is not effective fof far
You don't negotiate with a bully. You punch them in the nose.
Putin's demands: 1.  Disarm. 2.  Acknowledge Crimea & certain eastern regions of Ukraine is part of Russia. 3.  Ukraine must never join NATO.  Russia wants to strip Ukraine of its sovereignty and become a vassal state.  Like N Korea is to China.  They want a buffer between themselves & the free world.  I should say the Russian gov't, since the Russian people want different things than Putin does.
Erdogan has supported Sanctions & Military action against Russia in UN, how can he act like mediator ?
IN OTHER NEWS VALDEMAR PUTTIN SAYS HE WILL NOT END THE WAR UNLESS JOE BIDEN GIVES UP HIS BUTT CHEEKS.. HE WANTS CHEEKS THATS ALL HE WANTS.. COME ON JOE YOU CAN DO IT TAKE ONE FOR THE TEAM
Putin set conditions that he knows will not be meet. Ukraineian people will not stop fighting. If someone was trying to kill would u stop? Or if someone broke into your home wouldn't u defend it? As for me they would be introduced to my evil AR 15. But I'm sure some liberal would say come on in and take everything.
go !! russia !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Erdogan is putting shirt beyond his size !!
Putin, enough. Stop the war.
Only the Muslims can stop this war. Ameen. 😘😘☪️☪️☪️
Thank you ex cuzzin- I am grateful, honorable, esteemed brother President Vladimir Putin for being sensible with the Ukraine and putting and end to this conflict. Enough bloodshed for Russia an Ukraine. Peace be with you Brothers Zelensky/ Putin.
If one of the "demands" is to have Ukraine as part of Russia, then how does he expect Ukrainians to stop fighting and defending their motherland? He wants to end it, he needs to pull out the Russian soldiers.
What, exactly, are Moscow's (so Putin's) demands ?  Why is that being avoided by people who want to seen as a credible news source ?
Putin ending is coming
This tells us NOTHING. What are Moscows demands? This is shit reporting WION.
Putin u can't win to ukraine..beacuse around the world support ukraine
I'm guessing he is worried that he is about to be replaced the Russian way. He will leave office horizontally!
what a crybaby, sad that the resistance is stronger than your military? sad that your country is under attack by anonymous? sad that your country is realizing who you really are? sad that you bff china is not helping?   Soon you will be asking Ukraine and NATO to end this conflict that you started, and our terms will be that you will lose the leadership rights as “president” and your country will undergo democracy.
whats the demands!!!????
What does a joker know about running a country. The truth is, he is responsible for everyone's death. All innocent people who have suffered and died.
That full of crap go ukraine keep it up 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
Stop fighting based on a dictators vague promise!!! It's in his court to pull out!!!
Doesn’t say much.
If ukraine stop fighting, ,  who started the fight? O M G, , ,sya pa talaga mg set ng condition, ,
The clip you are using in this segment is that latest? its kind of confusing, did they meet? or call? is that an old footage? a bit misleading..
so putin and the rest of th WEf kaus shwab clowns get together and start a war pop oil prices to 120 a barrel they make a killing in the market and then call a cease fire
One condition   His life, down with putin
😄 Too late putin. You picked a fight with a vicious adversary who ain't backing down. What were you thinking sir by invading Ukraine?
Yes. but fact still stays in PKMKB
Ukraine would stop fighting if the Russians pulled out. Sounds like a trick to me. How can anyone believe Puton will stop the advances and retreat? He's a lunatic!
noo, if you stop this war, you will pay damages and america will happy coz they will get money from your russia. let the nuclear  launch destroy america, America is the root of evil.
The man putting only has one plan to take Ukraine any conditions he layout has only that in mind a physoparth would think that way
A winner in War never sets ceasefire conditions. Putin is at a loss...
Yea Putin will halt just like when he said he would to allow humanitarian to get ppl out, then he said, sike, and started bombing ppl. Yea. You could keep your demands and promises
The media should report specifics on what Russia’s demands actually are (omission style reporting is irresponsible journalism)
".. The So-called western democracy is full of lies.🤥  Hypocrites..What about the plights of Palestinians?.. It is an scar, on the conscious of the world." Over the mistreatment of unarmed civilians..
Ukraine won’t concede to Putin’s demands…
I think a lot of individuals today have poor understanding of geopolitics and thus fails to comprehend the antics of Russia.  Every country has its own interest and has every right to protects its interest when existential threats becomes apparent.  These same groups of people are the one that gets ‘bought in’ by western hypocrisy of NATO and the US.
So the war begins
Putin has a little you know what 🤣
Peace peace then sudden destruction
What are the demands? Click bait BS
Can you imagine?   Erdogan brokering a peace deal?
Ur killing innocent life u Russian idiot soldiers
Thanks God, please as soon as possible. End of war🙏🙏🙏
Putin the war criminal.
Putin is lying trying to Ukraine .. he is the agressor therefore he must  withdraw is troops first.   Ukrenian do not trust Putin and it generals  and army. defend yourself  and lets pray God to save Ukraine  and let be free democratic country .
Those idiot soldiers of Russia better go home u have a families
So what puttin. Is saying is that Ukraine should put down their arms an surrender cause they are only defending what is theirs they won't be fighting if he did not engage. their  country
NATO needs to abide by ALL their empty promises or else. They need to jettison Klaus Schwab!
Pangundang namu kay mahal na kaayong gasolina sa pilipinas tungod dw nnyu na pastilan pag puyo namu kay daghan mapagsamantalang negosyante ana inyu binuhatan
Can Putin be trusted, I do not believe so, he said Russia was only having war exercises near the border. At least Turkey is the key to all of this why because of the entrance through the Bosphorus, good on you Turkey
Will no one stop this mad man before he destroys more  innocent lives
Why u said same thing twice
Sometimes this channel is just for clicks I think
I clicked your YouTube and felt cheated by the headline.
Do YOU want to live under putins thumb?
PUTIN NARROW MIND, CRIMINAL,FOOLISH, EVIL.
Everyone is now against Russia and later they will be against China. But when the EU, NATO, or the United States and they allies created aggression, armed conflict, or war, no sanctions were imposed, and no one convicted of war crimes, committed genocide in Iraq, Yugoslavia, Afghanistan, Syria, and other countries. The next war caused by the US and its allies and military conflict will be in the Taiwan-China conflict where the US is sticking its nose with its allies to create another world war if the Russia-Ukraine conflict does not explode into a major world war. For decades, the United States has become the world's policeman and has been creating all sorts of conflicts between nations in order to create a great world war. It's all about selling weapons and making a lot of money and not for peace, peace and a good life for people. It is so SAD to see what happened today with us HUMANS !! ONLY GOD CAN STOP ALL THIS CHAOS !!
So... if Ukraine surrenders the Rusdians will cease fighting? We Eastern one would think so.  As for their demands last I checkedthe Emanuele Umrsine accepts a new puppet government friendly to Moscow bt not to its people like Belrus now has.2 Rssaetsgurantees that other countries join the EorNATO.    All former WarW Pact countries which joined E andNATO must be expelled from EU and NATO so they can then  reassimmilated into rear Rssian sphere of shit asubsequently stored with uclar hypersonic missilesaied authentication remains of Erope. Did I miss anything? To which any reasonable person would yell FU.K YOU PUTIN and immediately begin open hostilities against Russa ad Putin
It would be ill advice, period. Their is only one way to deal with bullies.
putin is a COWARD AND  murderer , a LIAR and EVIL sending young men to kill women and children - and putin will die as a result of his actions
What are "Moscow's demands" to be met? I was forever waiting for it but it never came. lol
Jesus Christ bless the people There 🙏
How many russian red lines do ukraine have to push? killing at least 13k russians by azov in eastern ukraine regions since 2014, block fresh drinking water to the russians, broke the minsk treaty, 2014 coup, zalensky and his azov army are commiting crime against humanity.  I must say Putin is a very patient man.
Ukraine has to stop fighting??? how does that work, they are the ones defending
Putin knows that's not possible so this war will continue indefinitely
He got stupid demands
Hope all will go well 🙏 I'm praying every day 🙏🙏🙏
No Putin your an invader
World leaders are playing with that lunatic Putin is in no position to set conditions regarding his wackiness in Ukraine y’all need to help Ukraine to defeat him then dig him out of the hole he’s in and get rid of him the world will be a better place without Putin
They are as clueless about things as most people are in the media. By the way, Putin demands were made public in 2012. The Ukraine does not join NATO, maybe the EU I think. And no further expansion of NATO or military NATO troops in Russia's Borders. The West and NATO ignored them and made the Ukraine the test of how far back they could push Putin.
Putin doesn't rule the world  He's a spoiled brat
By the way this is stalling, the demands must not be good.
She just said the same thing over and over. Obviously, his demands are give me your country.
Wat are the moscow's demands. Till the end it is not specified
Russia has to retreat immediately. Putin has to be judged by a russian court for warcrimes. There has to be a UN led investigation into that matter. Upon the russian court will have to decide. The investigation is open to name other responsible individuals. Russian troops have to leave all Ukrainian territory. Including the claimed Provinces in the east and Crimea. Russia has to declare its commitment to protect the territorial integrety of Ukraine, just as it already has done together with the USA and GB. Russia has to declare its commitment to follow the OSCE-Charta it signed. No sanctions shall be lifted before those aims are verfied to be reached by a UN-led Commission. Every nation decides on its own when its Sanction should end. Any further delay or threat is recognized as a declaration of war. Which allows the US and GB to see it as an attack against it and allows to declare Artikel 5 within Nato.
I would say to Putin that you will reap what you sowed and we will never stop fighting until every single Russia soldier is out of the Ukraine and that not one stay's in the Ukcraine and Putin stands in a trial for his war cimes.
If Moscow's demand are  " you give hand over your free nation to us with out   fight" And  trading it freedom for communism..   I'm guessing that will be a resounding NO!
Listened could not find any demand information in this news
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣good luck with that how about Putin can suck it. Ukrainians will never give up period. And Russian forces are looking just the way I thought they would trying to fight a modern war with 40 year old gear and kids plucked off the street this is already over it’s just a matter of when. Slava Ukrani ❤️
What are Putins demands?
about two hours after lunch I took a BIG PUTIN
What are Russia's demands ? Ukraine to surrender and what???
Putin destroyed the country , the people
Not going to happen. Revaluation is happening and NATO has been told they can send air support in. Sooo... It's about to get real if they do.
LoL🤣 Putin's condition to Ukraine to make them stop the war so laughable🤣✌️
So what are his conditions?
Putin for the fist pump.
My demand for you is to know what Mr Putin demand is.
Adolf Putin, another war criminal ! Do not listen to what he says, watch what he does !!! Actions speaks lauder then words, look at his actions in the Ukraine, terror and bombardment of civilians, women and children. He is a a product of the KGB !!!  Deceiver !!!
Well ? What are the conditions
Every channel needs to Read news slowly and clearly. Keep tone mild
Oh, any "end" of Putin's invasion of Ukraine by Putin can only be the beginning of the invasion of Putin's Russia by those (Russians and others) whom have been Putin's victims.  Putin's launched something much bigger and worse for himself than by and what he's inflicted on Ukraine (and others during his rule).
Russia has to withdraw it forces first . then Ukraine will stop fighting
Putin, treats ukrain stupid.. He should stop first the attract then, ukrain eikl believe him. PUTIN, do you think after these war you have started, theb, seems your talking like the ukrain start the War..  PUTIN, you TEKL YOUR TROOPS YO STOP ATTACKING AND GI BACK TO RUSSIA.. THEN.. UKRAIN 🇺🇦 WILL STOP.. OF COURSE PUTIN, THEIR.  PROTECTING, THEIR COUNTRY, BECAUSE, YOU KEEP ATTACKING THEM. PRESIDENT PUTIN.. YOU SJOYKD KNOW BETTER..

YOU DID PUTIN.. SO, SHOULD BE THE ONE PUTIN, TO STOP THIS WAR SHOOTING.
Clickbait and not worth watching.
ok but what's the demands? lol I hope Russia will also answer for damages caused to Ukraine as part of the agreement.
You cannot trust a thing Putin says
So basically no conditions just surrender your country to me smh what a joke
I am from Ukraine, but to believe that Americans" are helping ukraine is far from true: this is the same thing like america is promising to immigrants to protect the immigrants. One group of people is bringing you to United States, and another group of Americans are hunting you; And they are using all kind of illegal chemicals to hunt people:  I have been spy for over 15 years in the United States which they try to hunt and kill me - and that is only because i am Christian,, it is a miracle that I am still alive today.  Refuges immigrant people should be protected in the United States not to be hunted"  If you hear an American saying i love the Christian's - That is a lie.ss
I didn’t hear any demands
Rasputin
Pewwy. Putin poopin
Sooooo , putin will stop his invasion if ukraine agrees to an unconditional  surrender and becomes a russian territory , that sounds like a pretty fair compromise i’m sure he has the full support of the ukrainian people . Puti will never stop until he has levelled kiev , he will then spend the next 30 years trying to defend it and will make their Afghanistan war look like a skirmish . The Ukrainian people have made it quite clear they dont want to live under a russian authoritarian dictatorship
Click bait title with no new info.
Putin army are dyng n Lossing his tank,armor vehicle n air jet....that y Putin is afraid now
Putin, is a Savage, hes worse than Hitler!!!!
Masala dal rha hai news mein
Mad dog and semi - mad dogs are meeting of corse.  Neo Hitler Putin and similarly semi-Hitler meeting together… Hypocrite Paranoya Putin first must stop invading Ukraine first and not other way….
Eternal Father we offer thee the Body and Blood, Soul and Divinity of thy dearly beloved Son our Lord Jesus Christ, in atonement for our sins and the sins of the Whole World. For the sake of his sorrowful passion, have mercy on us and on the whole world Amen.
Putin's demands are for Ukraine to stop defending themselves and surrender? He wants them to stop resisting?
If Russia takes Ukraine back, it gives precedent to other powerful countries in the world like China to take other neighboring sovereign country or impose demand on them. North Korea will feel justified to try and take South Korea too cause they were historically one country.
Good decision Putin.. BUT  you killed many lives.. THANK GOD IF U STOP WAR...
Magkasundo na kyu para walang gyera mayabang lng talaga ang Pres. Ng Ukraine
Thats bullshit!
The reporter kept on mentioning "conditions and demands are met" but failed to say what those demands are.
You didn't say what those demands / conditions were
Have Putin and his cabinet lock up!
How can Ukrainian stopped fighting if Putin wants Ukraine to be invaded LOL😁
Special Economic Operations
I say give NATO membership to every country in the world, then if any country attacks another all the other countries will deal with it. Russia would never feel threatened again, and equally cannot attack other countries. PEACE IN OUR TIMES
Adolf Putin
If Ukraine stop fighting Russia will control  Ukraine which Ukraine will never accept.
Putin is a Cartel leader, the only difference is,  Oil and Energy are his drug. Putin uses the army for his dirty work. Putin and his friends benefit the monies.  Russian citizens are oppressed and cant even see real world news... WAKE up Russian Citizens don't you want freedom!!! LOOK AT WHAT HES DOING!!!
Conditions : “Give me everything i want or you all die.” 🤷‍♂️💩
Plenty of waffle - what were the conditions?
Ukraine 🇺🇦  give up yall can't win
Unless Putin will eliminate his war on Ukraine will never be stopped.
conditions my ass...
What the USA wants is to keep the dollar circulating , or it will bust its economy , no petrol dollar and  bye bye
How about someone in Russia, does the world a favor and introduces Putin to Jesus.
So what are Putin's demands??
BS video !! , this does not say anything !! , what are the full list of demands !! ???
What are Moscow's demands?
Here are Putin's 3 demands: 1. Recognize the Crimean vote to become sovereign with Russia 2. Ukraine and Russia must have a neutral border for peace 3. Abolish the Neo-Nazi agenda in Ukraine
Today WION is Pro turk. Lol.
Putin csn not make condtion to end this invasion as he has shot at kids women schools an other civilian homes but he isnt commiting war crimes by targeting civilian
booo, I was expecting to learn what were the demands, this is a clickbait, everyone knows putin has demands to end the war, what we want to know is what are those demands
What demands?? Wtf
well that was a waist of time
Putin is one deranged individual who has no care for nothing. Lives to him dont mean a damn thing. All he wants is to take over Ukraine and at whatever cost.  Lets Prey it dont get into a world war over a lunatic out of control.
An aggressor holding out an olive branch is showing his weakness. Putin wants out of Ukraine but on his terms? He is trying to save face. Pull the other leg, it plays jingle bells Commie! Putin is probably thinking about how long he can stay in power when his troops in Ukraine are eliminated and follow through by invading Russia!!
Soldier's,kids and innocent People are dying while zelensky and Evil Putin is hiding...??sadlife😡😡😡
As much as people want to believe Putin he just cannot be believed.
Zelensky. : no I don't,  I like fighting, I'm strong.
Why people call murder putin,a president.he is 1-st Secretary of Comunist Partii.he is dictator and bladz.
They didn't say squat now did they,
Niet
Surrender Putin without any conditoons
" No  👑 over ♂️, shall be above God and the Law." 🇬🇧
With US heading NATO. Putin's demand won't met. War goes on
They doing what USA dose invade and change governments.  Media dose not tell the history from inside the families of those countries plus they are not white or well educated as they see them) Ukraine will be wrecked. In their hand to stop the lost of life. This president is nuts Uk. If just NATO y USA would make an agreement before... But I know they wouldn't. Now they just puting more gasoline, more carnage as a result.
Put in some conditions
The USA (and the UK) signed the 1994 Budapest Memorandum and ensured the Ukrainians (read your history book again or Wikipedia) that Russia will not invade Ukraine or even threaten to invade Ukraine. The Ukrainians trusted USA and UK to enforce the Memorandum. As a result, Ukraine had given up their nuclear weapons (at that time, Ukraine had the 3rd largest nuclear program in the world) in exchange for peace because Ukraine had mistakenly believed that USA and UK will protect them from Russia. Without nuclear weapons, Ukraine has been vulnerable to attacks my neighboring countries, especially Russia. Ukraine kept their promise to strip themselves of nuclear weapons. Yet, the USA and UK are still not sending in troops to defend Ukraine to fight Russia directly, making Ukrainians feel betrayed by the 1994 Budapest Memorandum. Had Ukraine kept their nuclear weapons and had Ukraine not believe in USA and UK for protection, this Russia invasion of Ukraine would have never happened. The USA and UK can rectify this by staying true to the 1994 Budapest Memorandum.
if the condition is meet maybe they need also to help ukraine to built again what they destroyed.dont trust communist country
Ah yes, the demands of Russia to end the conflict are the demands of Russia to end the conflict. Thank you
In short surrender.
So what are the demands?  Terrible clickbait video.
Russia will stop when the win …   That’s the demand
Most wanted man -putin. 5000$ for his head.
Putin is ridiculous.   "GIVE ME WHAT I WANT!....no?......SPECIAL MILITARY OPERATION!.....you guys are being mean to me; fine, lets talk..... GIVE ME WHATI WANT! <whilst thousands of Russian soldiers dead, POWs are calling their moms in Russia to come get them, Russian economy plummets>.....no?...... U GUYZ R BEING MEAN, IM NOT DOOING NEFING, fine let's talk.....GIVE ME  I WANT <more Russian soldiers dead and captured, thousands of Russian civilians and children arrested for peaceful protesting against Putin, economy is nothing>....no?...... I'M HERO! Everyone will suffer AFTER I GET WHAT'S MINE!"  Putin hides and whines while Zelenski fights.  Putin has to be terrified.
I came here to learn how to invest after listening to a guy on radio talk about the importance of investing and how he made $460, 000 in 4 months from $160k, some how this video has helped.
Ok I just wasted my time watching to old men shake hands while one of them walks around like a big shot looking like a fkg joke
Putin is a thug and a war criminal. The gang of sycophants and toadies are war criminals too. They belong in the Hague, facing trial for their crimes.
Tell him these are the Conditions:1) You turn yourself into the world court. 2) To  be tried for crimes against humanity.
HE wants  to take Ukraine 🇺🇦 over that that he wants.... Glory Ukraine 🇺🇦 FROM USA 🇺🇸
WHAT ARE THE DEMANDS?!
What a ridiculous demand.
Putin is DEFINITELY in control😉🇷🇺💪🏻
THEREFORE NOTHING OF INTERESTING WAS SAID. NI NEED TO REPORT AT ALL. TURKEY 🦃 IS A 🌎 WORLD TRAITOR. DIDDYBOPER 💘💖💓❤️😇
If Ukraine stops fighting?!!!
Gentle ,humble president in wall with a comedy president  😭🙌
Joe Biden nato and all nato members.  Hear me now! Send in a ghost army who speaks the dialect under the Ukrainian flag and crush those commies!
It's to late he's a decieving liar 👎🏾
Ww3
what are "these demands?"
Sod Putin carry on fighting Ukraine ,h'es loosing , take him on into Russia and get rid of him , we the world will be for ever in your debt
What are moscows demands???
Ukraine's demands could easily become 20 years of guerrilla warfare at home plus an eternity of terrorist activities inside Russia
couldn't be any more clear, thanks for explaining the conditions <3
In other words if Ukraine serenaders to Russia and gives Russia what it wants will the world let this happen 😮
What will happen to  Ukraine the good, hardworking people  Concentration camps  It's 2022 and this is what mankind still wants for one man to get away with killing  Millions of people over a border !!!!
That's all very well and good, but what EXACTLY are Putins demands?  So far, all I've heard are lies, misinformation and threats from Putin, nothing concrete about what it will take to get him to bugger off back to Russia and take his bedraggled half starved troops back home.  Vids like this one aren't. helpful either, they're just clickbait.
Thank you for wasting 2 minutes of my time!
if you meet them its all for nothing
Refugees? There getting 3 year residents in UK probably in every European country , every body will leave now with a deal like that,  even putin will sign up for a deal like that
Well what are the conditions??
Atleast turkey has something to do. Hey US and UK what's up. 😂😂😂
Ukrainians are so privileged humans, I mean see all the support they got all around the world.. I am a little bit jealous. Imagine if it was a third world country... They won't even care about their whole existence. 😏 Humans lives are really not equal my friend. Need to make yours value. We might all get atomic bombs one day, so that everyone is respected.
Are Russians good for anything?
Putin is crazy,why would Ukraine agree with this shit,Russia is stuffed now
What are the demands?
GOD WATCHES US..AT THE END HE IS THE POWERFUL JUDGE..
wow what an informative video definitely not a cash grab or anything
wion trying to get views with a title like that. and its working
Putin or any world leaders cannot nd should not dictate any independent nations on what are they want for the future of their country.they will not live for centuries, what do you think will happen if time comes that they are no longer in this world,? What do the future generation will do? Will they say that we can't do these becoz Putin say so.. And by the way demands and conditions are written to be broken. Ukraine abandoned their nukes in the condition that Russia will honor their sovereignty.. What follows is history
No deal Russia gets weaker as the war continues and America grows stronger as well as nato gets bigger
This channel is slow turning into clickbaity garbage
They need to push for a Gadaffi scenario on Putin
There is an old story about a scorpion and a frog. The scorpion asks to frog to carry him across a river. The frog says no because the scorpion will sting him and kill him. The scopion says no he won't, it'll all be fine. Half way across the river the scorpion stings the frog. As the frog is dying he asks why? The scorpion says because I'm a scorpion. That's what we do. So they both die in the river. Never trust a scorpion. Putin is a scorpion. Trusting him is just pure stupidity.
I entered my neighbor's house without consent and ransacked his place.  When my neighbor discovered me, he told me to get out. He did not even ask me to make right the mess that i had done there.  I said ok, I will leave, but based on my T&C.
No war✊🏿
Just stop fighting pretty reasonable.  I just don't understand why the ukranians still fighting.
Why must any country allow this mad & greedy man to  dictate his own term & condition? Who is the one invading another country? It's clear that this greedy man wants to revive the former USSR & stupid people think he is a hero. He is only supporting india since india is dependant on russia & now he's a friend of another rogue leader in china so, go & suck up to Xi now!
The demands are you better cut the crap before your hung, bargain for your own freedoms. Your a politician. Lol 😂 A tyrannt, my demands are this.. I'm thinking like Bush we don't negotiate with terrorists. The world is changing, national terrorists are new terroists.
NAZI SS PUNISHERS BANDERA AND SHUKHEVYCH ARE OFFICIAL HEROES OF UKRAINE, THEY ARE ON THE BANKNOTES OF UKRAINE! STREETS AND STADIUMS ARE NAMED AFTER THEM, MONUMENTS ARE ERECTED TO THEM! IN UKRAINE, NAZI SYMBOLS AND DEMONSTRATIONS, DEMOLISHED MONUMENTS TO THE WINNERS OF THE FASCISTS!
Right everyone knows Putin is so trustworthy he's only gone back on his word how many times why hasn't the U.N. filed war crimes against him
What are the conditions and demands
Is this how to make demands by targeting unarmed civilians with rockets and missiles. Putin fell into the traps of the West and his actions will hunt him and Russians for a long time.
AMC🚀
Meet the demands. STOP THE KILLINGS IN UKRAINE NOW! THANK YOU  AMEN 😘
This serial killer of Women and Children needs taking out, Either by his Generals or anyone that's close to him
Maybe NATO should start bombing Russia until their demands are met - complete de-Putinisation of Russia. Same logic.
Waste of 2min of my life.....What are the fucking conditions?
Putin is a deranged despot and the sane Russians who have empowered him are cowardly scum
Sooo the war will continue because Putin will be too unreasonable in his demands. Noted.
This was probably the most pointless news video I’ve ever seen. Who knew Russia would stop its invasion if Ukraine just surrendered? How about some actual news next time.
And the conditions are…?
Didn’t say what any of the demands were. How is this news?
I didn't even watch this video I just saw his face and thought to myself they should do him like Hussein or soleimani or maybe since he wants to vicariously live through Hitler's penis, I guess he'll have the same end fate
This psychopath Putin can sit no closer than 30 meters from his 'FRIENDS'. He  is barely a human. If humanity were to survive this man must be neutralized. The sooner this happens the safer the world will be. If not, there will be many aspiring psychopaths waiting in line after him.
Short man syndrome
Well,if he learned german when he was a “Spy” maybe he needs to look up the meaning of “negotiations “ in German so that he can understand what “negotiating” means! 🤨
Release or exchange of imprisoned/convicted spies, military control of some or more areas of Ukraine, lifting of economic sanctions, may be included in Moscow's demands.
Stop the war in Ukraine!  Russia invaded a free democratic country. Putin is destroying not only Ukraine but also Russia. The Ukrainian army stands strong.
What will be met is Putin's and his entourage's appointment with the Hangman's rope for War Crimes.
So what are those demands
Because Pres. Putin is surpriced that  the Ukraine people are fighting back to defend themselves not only their small military which Putin assumed to be crashed in days not years, because the world CYBER WARRIORS are ready and doing every opportunity to derail or cause spellbound on Russian Electronic Controls to malgunction. So as long as Russian troops are still in Ukraine no Ukrainians in their right mind will let down their arms
Thank you lord..i wish u touch his heart to become more soft…❤️❤️❤️pls stop the war!!!!
Turkey basically being a mediator here between Russia and Ukraine
...I was watching Gravitas: the indian speaking on why Russia attacked Ukraine. She explains well. I am with you Mr Putin. The west wants your resources. Anyone on here thinks Russia is wrong to react, either don't involve yourself in politics, and don't bother learning law. Stay dumb, stay high.
Nice job on prompt reporting of this news update.
Don't let Putin set any conditions, he is in no position to set any. Sanctions are working in conjunction with invasion costs and curbing of protests, which will hopefully grow bigger as more Russians start learning the truth, to bleed Russian economy. He is weak so go for the Jugular. No more appeasement. He invaded a sovereign country without reason,  fired indiscriminately on civilians, intentionally caused biggest refugee crisis since WW2, turned Ukraine into ruins... Get Hague on the case and once this is over, the moment he steps out of Russia, arrest the SOB... the only place where he belongs is a prison or an asylum.
B.S
Of course ...why else would have fighting... for something right...some demands..  . What's new about that. What are those demands is what the world wants to know.  Come on... this was basic knowledge...noone fights for nothing.... or for fun. Demands are always attached.
Sorry I can't take a country called "TURKEY" seriously. LOL The 1970s..."Jive Turkey." LMAO
Where were these people when NATO invated Libya in Afrika? The roster coming back to roost.
Why does every anchor on WION want to "tell us"?!! Even Palki Sharma uses this phrase so very often. It's demeaning! We aren't children that we have to be "told"!! 😠
Putin kills as much persons as he can until his demands are met....Putin kills as much persons as he can until his demands are met....Putin kills as much persons as he can until his demands are met....if his demands are met, all dictators on earth will do what he did.
Putin you declare the war to the world and the world is declaring war to you………. Can you really think you can win mmmmm
All we are saying,  Is give peace a chance.
Puto says he will hire 900 mercenaries.
So you think, you hold the world. You are not God, you will meet our karma...
IT WAS VLADIMIR PUTIN WHO START THE WAR ….. SO IT SHOULD BE VLADIMIR PUTIN STOP THE WAR .
As even if kreml stay alive after the war they need to be killed of security forces that can operate global in the same way Usama Bin laden was terminated.
No what he wants is to make a deal so Iran can get a nuclear weapon and has nothing to do with the deal trump walked away from..it's a new way of screwing the World  and this imbecil President with no brain will probably go for it so he can go down in the history books as the biggest laughingstock of the World who sold out Americans and all FREE LOVING PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD...  that's  stupid and that's what stupid is..  right Blundering Biden....
The losing side has the audacity to make a list of demands.  🤣
Rusia should stand en peace and tell mr Putin go and ………..
RUSSIA DEMAND UKRAINE NOT TO WAR  ? IT WAS RUSSIA VLADIMIR PUTIN   S T A R T THE WAR , “NOT” UKRAINE …..SO , IT  MUST BE PUTIN TO STOP THE WAR , STOP INVADING OTHER SOVEREIGN COUNTRY OUTSIDE RUSSIA …..  WAKE UP VLADIMIR PUTIN , YOU ARE DREAMING TOO MUCH …… !!!
I love u so much president Putin u are a man of honor 💪 God bless you sir
What are the demands ???
What are those demands? 🤔 and the Russians need to cease the fighting and destruction… what a shame!  Senseless!!!!!!!
The video show it all, Putin want to show the world that he is willing to go all out in war by exchange fist, instead he also willing to give handshake to willing friends..Putin is epic!
Just do what he's asking... im tired of high gas prices and food prices and b.s. media crap...  enough...
You repeat the same thing over and over... but no details. What's the point?
So what’s the demands then?????????????????????????
Imagine all the people living life in peace
All this evil and ingronat leaders are taking our world  🌎 to chaos
Waste of time watc
Given Putin's commitments to the last 2 ceasefires ending with targeting civilian refugees, I would would not think Russia would honor peace.   Putin's word, like the Ruble is worthless.
After what I just learned about Ukraine let Putin get what he wants niether side is innocent
Failed to tell us Moscow's demands Thought that would have been important to mention
so what are his demands??? what kind of reporting is this?  Whats he want?   i have no clue
Not sanctions, we're liberating Russia from it's money.
If putin is willing to go this far . i think we have an obligation to let ukrain join nato. right now. then we just do the article 5 and push them back to russia.   negotiate with this maniac wont work. just use fire with fire and put the ball in his camp to negotiate when hes under siege by 31 country's
Alright! Ukraine has an option🤗 if Zelensky REALLY wants to be a FCKIN hero and save his people HE BETTER take IT!! and add to that agreement to make Putin help rebuild the city. They have a little open door to STOP THIS War ,just TAKE IT !!!!  Zelensky better not listen to NATO they're snakes evil leaders
All we have to do is for Ukraine to give up its rights to self determination. In return, they get Ukraine and all other states that were once part of the Soviet Union. Let's go Putin. We'll see how cocky Putin is after a month of sanctions.
How make it breaking news without the news 🤦
The only way to end war is the unconditional Surrender of Russia.  for the poor Russian soldiers and their peoples.
🇺🇦🇺🇦Slava Ukraina!🇺🇦🇺🇦Geroyam Slava!🇺🇦🇺🇦
Hmn coz you know you're losing n the Economic sanctions bloody hell Putin!!!
What part of "they would rather die than go back to being a Russian colony" can't he understand?
Don't fall for it
This channel sucks.
Another lie
Talking about the conditions without even saying what they are? WION is hiding something from the people.
"I will quit hiding in my bunker like a dog if you give in to my demands" .
Intensify the fighting, longing to see Europeans refugees migrating to Asia. How will they feel when we treat them like pariahs...😂
Never trust Putin...the world should be the one giving him an ultimatum..."leave Ukraine or we will wipe out your country in the map"? The fact that he has been lying to the world (including his people), it means he has no intentions to stop invading Ukraine.
Putin must not set conditions, he started this war. Sanctions must not be lifted against Russia, Putin is blood thirsty, he should be jailed for disturbing the peace and onslaught of innocent civilians, he’s a CRIMINAL.
Russia has endured terrible conditions in the past, from NAZI Germany during World War II, from Prussian-Germany in World War I, and from Napoleans' France that marched to Moscow and destroyed the city. They are not the type who will be scared, instead threats harden them. It is better to negotiate cease fire with them.
LOL...soo...what *are* the conditions/demands ?!
Putin is delusional
Would have been nice to hear Moscow's conditions, as the video's title let expect..
“Putin says Ukraine invasion will end when conditions are met”. Why does it take almost two minutes to drop THAT bombshell?🥴
So what are the demands lady? Geeesh. 🤦🏽‍♂️
Putin is not after the world just Ukraine. He has the right to protect his country at all cost. Zelensky was a weak spot becoming a puppet for the west. I would take Ukraine too.
Not happening
Peace
Water pointless televised
Here's a condition for "Poutine": pull out of the Ukraine, or have the world put a hit on your ass. I volunteer.
It's just a smoke screen. He has no intentions of ending the invasion. He has too much riding on this war he started and he knowns his political survival if not personal survival depends on winning. He will eventually announce that due to the "unreasonable" demands of the  Ukrainians , he is "forced" break off negotiation and to continue the war. Just wait and see how evil operates.
Terrible reporting, this station is trash, you keep saying demands but dont say what they are
So what are Putin's demands,,, and how can he demand its not his country.
If Moscow's demands are met, then of course there will be more  demands--seeing as how everyone was willing to meet his previous demands.
Perhaps we should lay out the conditions to let Russian troops go back home safely. LOL Who will still listen to the mafia's threat? KGB.
when Putin's demands are met
RUSSIA IT'S  TIME FOR  A FULL BOAMBAMENT  ON THE UKRAINE CAPITAL OF KIVE TO SHOW A GOOD EXAMPLE OF THE  GLORY OF  RUSSIA WITH FURTHER  LOSD OF LIFE OF THE RUSSIAN SOLDIERS USE CRUISE  MISSILES FLATTEN   UKRAINE SOME OF THE   MERCENARY ARE AMERICAN N  NATO SOLDIERS
Q
Pull back, no conditions
Phok puttin
War crimes and  genecide.
He knows he's in for a long haul.
Dont trust
The only one of Moscow's demands mentioned was for Ukrainians to stop fighting.
so he is asking ukraine to surrender
Maybe if Ukraine will have its own nuclear arsenal too.
This is good news for the most part.
Like anyone is listening to his conditions. Those days are over...
What a waste of time. What conditions????
WHY PUTIN HAS TO PUT CONDITIONS??
Ukraine will stop fighting when Russia stops trespassing! Putin is really nut!🤣🤣
Saying the same thing over and over by the  announcer, without giving the details of his demands is a waste of time and a waste of time.
More like gremlin
I don't care what ever Russia and Ukraine workout Russia threatened the world with nuclear weapons even if they stop fighting sanctions need to remain until Russia demilitarize and dismantles all nuclear weapons they have threaten the world for years and it cannot continue every time Putin doesn't get his way he will threaten with his nuclear weapons he must be removed no more doing business with Russia until he's gone
No conditions for Ukraine just leave.
1 min of reporting nothing
How one single human being is allowed to inflict mass murder on a people and basically be allowed to continue or even to exist, well it's beyond me. It's supposedly taboo to say just take him out - he's the problem. The most evil men among us seem to get away with anything and everything. Yes, I'm including Trump. Thumbs up if you agree. And now, here come the haters...
Putin's conditions for ceasefire are murky. Ukraine will never stop fighting because they know they cant trust Putin. He is a liar. And they know it. Putin would never recognize Ukraine's sovereignty. Unless Putin has some GUARANTEE he will stop the war, there will be no peace.
then what are moscow’s demands?
How can Ukraine comply to Moscow’s demands where it is really meant for NATO?
What a joke
Putin has reported to have terminal cancer,
Purton is a very smart president.  ..
Culprit, who makes disaster
The audacity! You invaded a relatively peaceful country for no just cause. Now you have the balls to say you'll stop killing them and destroying their homes only if they stop fighting back. WOW!
Unless Russian troops are withdrawn from Ukraine then the Ukraine military and militias has no enemy to defend from. Ukraine is only defending themselves from Russian attacks, it's absurd that Pres. Putin only stop the war if Ukraine stop fighting back?????
Turkey should not take sided of russia as russia sees turkey as threzt in black sea strategically and will eventually attack it for same reason ad ukraine
I will resume watching WION videos only after all of my conditions are met.
Ukraines terms are when the last Russian soldier leaves or is dead, Mr Putin May recover his dead and peace will be restored!
Poetin is getting old. He just wants one more show and the west gave him this. The west is far more guilty to all of this then most people think. I am a western citizen and I don't blame Poetin, but leave the women and chilrdren alone. In war there are only losers.
“If only kings fought their own wars”
Why are people shaking this monster’s hand? Didn’t someone put a bounty on him. Get this over with
Unacceptable, the war just won’t end then.
Maniac Putin God almighty will move you.
Anything new?
I don't want it to stop. I want Putin to hunt down the Nazi's that have caused untold suffering and death on the Russian for 8 whole year. No mercy for the neo-nazi that burned people alive.
The only thing I can say is Russian army  took out a 12year old girl the only thing that was in my head at that time was well I can't handle seeing women and kids being killed if you are trying to free someone in America Putin I suggest you quit i don't need to be free I can free myself when I die civilian women and kids are just not good even if you tell the people that they have to leave you still are only supposed to hit up government and system type of building 🏢 ok Russian army Putin much 💜❤️ to all of the fallen civilians in this war in Ukraine
Putin doesn't want piece and is ready to go out scorched earth style.
Wait Ukraine has to stop fighting first even tho they are the ones being invaded??? Lol. This is going to we're and he has no intention of stopping.
Putin, pound sand!
Russia is a threat to everyone in the region. What is happening in Ukraine is scary and can happen to any ex soviet country ...
I think Ukraine should meet Russia's demands.
So funny an islamic terrorist state Turkey mediating 🤪
GLAD PALKI  IS NOT  DOING THIS BROADCAST,, SHE IS AN IMBARRASSMENT TO WION AND HER COLLEAGUES AND IS TOOOO ARROGANT AND FIULL OF HERSELF!!!      DOES INCOMPLETE AND UNFAIR RESEARCH
Last time that I come to this site. Poor coverage and often with Russian bias.
Putins war, go home and kiss your children and war no more Russians
🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺👍👍❤️
This could have all  been avoided if the Ukrainians had said they will never join nato before hostilities started.
He does not want peace, he wants  Ukraine.   He will destroy Earth with his nuclear missiles, and in the end there will be no Ukraine 🇺🇦, nor will there be Russia. Third World War  will kill us all, along with Mr. Putin.
Putin should end his regim this idiot dangerous not only to his country but to other country.
Moscow's demands are literally mean that Ukraine recognizes that it should not exist.
Ok..see who wants peace here you mf
Stop fightin? Russia should stop invading. Putin has gone crazy. How would Ukraine stop responding to russia's invading? Sit on the bench and drink coffee watching their cities being bombed and its people murdered? 🙄😏🤔
russia wants NATO to stop their quest for expansion!
Putin son of hitler
Its awkward to look at putin setting conditions to ukraine i dont know how such conditions will be met god bless you ukraine god will always side you
He left him hanging 0:39
This should obviously be settled with pillow fighting.
Why did Putin extend his hand first in a fingers closed position, not extending them until Erdogan raised his handfor a friendly handshake ?!  This reveals Putins alterior motives.
WHAT ARE THE CONDITIONS AND DEMANDS!!!
So this sick idiot is holding ukraine hostage for his selfish demands.
He has no business setting conditions.
and after he broke the ceasefire how can we take him seriously
what specific demands did moscow make
What the hell are the conditions? Worthless segment
So he says Ukraine to stop fighting to stop the war when there was a ceasefire and the Russian army ignored it.Putin is a constant liar.He just wants to take all of Ukraine thats why he invaded it.
It's too late for Putin. Time for his entry into his new war crimes tribunal.  He will rot I  prison i hope for what he did to Ukraine and all those poor people.
Click bait..no info
What are Putin's demands if Ukraine stops fighting? This was not mentioned.
Those are not “Refugees.” They are citizens on involuntary holiday.
Thank you for sharing this news. After watching this I'm now well informed of what Putin's conditions, you said every demand and condition point by point you didn't miss a thing! 😂
This video is fucking useless.  - To stop fighting, they must meet his conditions. - The conditions are that his demands must be met. - His demands are that they stop fighting.  Bruh, none of that fucking meant anything to anyone.
So in other words "Just stop resisting!" Is The Kremlins solution
To hell with Putin
Look at Mykolaiv, Russia is losing.  Good Luck getting out of this one Putler.
Fact. When Ukraine was attacked by Russia, all countries from Europe, especially from NATO units hated and condemned Russia. But when Israel carried out decades of inhumane attacks on Palestine, everything was silent. Even FIFA and UEFA did not sanction Israel itself. So where is the sense of Justice? Europe only sided with its allies and they really hated Muslims. That's why they always intimidate countries from the East.
America must recruit and send seasoned mercenaries to help out the heroic Ukrainian military! It’s losing men and weapons on a daily basis: replacing the weapons is not enough! It’s a much smaller force than the Russians and getting even smaller. America is considering sending planes to Ukraine. WHY NOT FIGHTERS?
russia embarrassed themselves on a world stage and gained nothing and lost its entire economy and relations with the whole world.
Putin is losing war and he is mad too.
HER ACCENT IS VERY IRRITATING TO LISTEN TO.
Stupid demand
Well That ain't gonna happen cause Ukraine ain't gonna kneel to the Kremlin
After Putin will be able to kill thousands or my be much more innocent lives in Ucrania .. will Indian democracy will be able to be silent for the only purpose to buy more military equipment from russia ?
This war will take russian people back to the 70.s.
Are you going to tell us what the demands are, or are you going to be a poor journalist?
Big Batty boy that a kill innocent people
Putin destroyed Corona from news completely
You yupping a lot, but not saying anything  with sense.
I thought Russia had only one mad man but maybe that country is full of mad men.
The World antwort is Finantial special operation on russia
SO what are Moscow's demands then??? You mentioned it multiple times 🤷‍♂🤷‍♂
OMG
we should send cruise missiles on special flight operations.   they aren't missile strikes,  they are perfectly reasonable and peaceful special flight operations, to save invading soldiers.   special flight operations for the missiles will only stop when the invading russian troops are safely back across the border in russia, minus their tanks and artillery.
what are his demands and will he keep his promise. NOT@
....if Putin's demands are met: "to make Ukraine part of Russia..." what a tyrant!
Couldn’t trust a word Putty be saying. First off with cease fires to let the civilians escape and heal the wounded mans yet his soldiers continues the shooting. Now he’s asking Ukrainian to stop firing first yet he’s the one who started the fight that needed to stop firing first.
Turkey is a great ally of NATO and can help end this war
If I am Putin I probably do the same thing.
...and demilitarization of Russian gangsters, immediately
What are two of Russia's demands? First, it wants the Ukraine to remain a neutral state and second, it wants the US to allow Europe to freely trade with the rest of Eurasia.
As I seem to recall Russia guaranteed Ukraine they would not attack if they gave up their nukes years ago....Russias word isnt worth a pinch of shit.
Putin : wake up Zelensky Zelensky : what's happening? Putin : stop fight with me! Zelensky : OMG... I knew NATO & USA never help me
How about biden, zelenskyy and putin in cage match with 1 knife at the middle? Winner take all. Ukranians and russians don't deserve to suffer from their egos.
Glad to hear that Putin is now being reasonable and offering conditions.  This may sound stupid, but the greater point is why is this being reported in the first place. Its just being a mouth piece for the Russian Gov't.
That's useless demand..
His demands will never be met. Ukraine has the right to be militarized and Crimea and Donbas will return to Ukraine.
Each country knows who is Corrupt Incompetent people
Demands from Moscow? You mean demands from Putin. This sounds like a hostage situation. The aggressor needs to stop fighting first!
Everybody in every country needs to Lynch their own government officials and be done with these people and their wars they always have
Ukraine will look like syria.
No to russia demands
The guy that negotiates with terrorists is the former guy. Sorry Putin.
CALL HIM CRIMINAL, NOT PRESIDENT
I 👃🐂💩
It always about money
Follow the Money
She never said anything of the demands.
thank you president erdogan for making step to stop the war for the peace of the world
Erdogan: We wanna contribute to a peaceful resolution to this conflict. 5 minutes later: Turkeys sends another shipment of strike drones to Ukraine.  classic boys, classic.
Stop Putin
What are the demands? Will you tell us?
Scimitar to the neck would solve a lot.
End the FED and end NATO
Demands met or not, he still let bloodshed happen. Better die trying than die captive.
And "Moscow's"/Putin's demands are....?
Is Putin going to live for ever. What happened to Idi Ameen, Robert Mugabe, same will follow to this dictator too.
Putin is a lie! Go to Hell Putin!!
Okay so it's video I love you guys channel is great but this video was almost completely useless because it just kept saying he's laid them all out until those conditions are met but I think it would be a good idea to just say like what those conditions are again if they are the same conditions maybe repeat them because then somebody that's was stumbling across it won't be going what conditions? Just an idea unless you truly don't know what those conditions are they
Zero information, just the same thing over and over and over again. Screw this.
Putin has only one demand and that is Ukraine's Unconditional Surrender.
UKRAINE AS SMALL AND WITHOUT BIG Military TRUCKS HAS BROUGHT A GIANT LIKE PUTIN ON HIS KNEES BY RESISTING.. KIKIKIKIKIKI NOW HE CAN AGREE TO CEASE FIRE 🔥🔥🔥 SURELY IS NOT ABOUT HOW BIG BUT HOW WELL... I THOUGHT HE'LL TAKE UKRAINE IN JUST A DAY... HAHAHAHA 🤣😂🤣
Russia has the right to safeguard the country
Go  home  peacefully  and  you  will  live  If  not  you  will  die  Says IAM who Iam Amen and amen  As  with  Putin  will  die  Says IAM who Iam Amen and amen  To the  Russian people Says IAM who Iam Amen and amen
Nato dogs need to back off. They have caused this.
What are the conditions? ? Total surrender????
For me if ukraine president give a room for Putin this country will bloom again and her economy will be progrissive again
Massive clip bait. U never find out any new info they just recycle old news.
And what are those conditions? I learned more from the title than the video.
What demands? Putin is feeling the pressure?
Want to hear a joke? Special Military Operation And Peace by Tolstoy
To  all  Russian  troops  Go  home  if you  want  your  life  spared  or  we  will  take  you  out  Says IAM who Iam Amen and amen
Putin is feeling the pinch. Tell stupid no deal . Ukraine want Putin to pull army out of Ukraine. And go home where he will be dealt with.
Bunch of globalist elites who are surrendering to a  dictator 😂 what a joke that is!
Please help Ukraine. Everyday Ukrainian're going to  be killed by  Putin. We must show the progress of humankind, not same as before.  Remember Malala. One  child can chenge the world.   In Japan even children go to Ukraine embassy to donate their money. A child said I have just only small money, But I want to donate it for Ukraine. Please put your comments on SNS for Ukraine andrew wipe Putin out from the world.
simply that USA and NATO are afraid to Putin hahaha...... they keep on pushing the sanctions on Putin but Putin;s army are destroying Ukraine every hour..... USA and NATO more words but no actions! Putin just laughing about their mumbling bumbling sanctions coz it will never affects him and his rich friends
"Conditions" like "unconditional surrender"?
So what are the "demands?"  Common sense that he has demands.
DAMN!! He doesn't want much. How does that go " Be my Slaves " I will stop killing you. Does that about do it?
And to think I admired Putin until two weeks ago. I had him wrong. He has made a fool of himself, and will go down in history alongside Stalin or even Hitler. I'm very embarrassed for him.
Sounds like some one sided conditions. Sounds more like he's asking them to bow down to him. 🖕 putin
Never trust communist putin..
Would be more helpful if you repeated what those conditions were. Not that I believe for one moment that the Ukrainians will now stop fighting under any circumstances, given the Russian warfare on civilians, but it will helpful for new viewers
The Russians saw that Ukraine joint to Nato as an iltimatum to Russia.They  will fight to they last man and.weapon
"Download the app now" Stop commanding us!!!!!!!!!😡🤬
To  all  Russian  troops  Go  home  or  you  will  die  Says the  LORD God of Hosts in Jesus Christ Name amen and amen Says IAM who Iam Amen and amen
SO WHAT ARE THE CONDITIONS ???
Whatever demand it is,,,respect and granting so this war end.People of both countries may get back to normal and peaceful life again.May the spirit of humanity and sincerety dwell in the heart of the leader... God bless and peace on earth!
For the sake of your people please negotiate with Russia. I learnt what Russia is demanding is neutrality. That means do not join NATO alliance. Please end this suffering.   Given the way you are criticizing NATO for not helping you, it is likely that the members will not vote to admit you. A lot of the members do see Ukraine as a stable country.  For God's sake end the suffering.
SO WHAT ARE HIS FULL DEMANDS AND WHAT GUARANTEE?
What is the point of telling us Putin will end the war if his demands are met, without telling us what those demands are? Of course those in war stop once their objectives are achieved. That isn't news. I learned nothing.
I'd say give Ukraine, Turkey and Iran to Russia and be done with it.
With  draw  All  Russian  troops  out of   Ukraine   and  Putin  give  your  self  up  for  War crimes  or  we  will  come after you  we  and the  Russian people  Says IAM who Iam Amen and amen
Obviously the demands will be that Ukraine will be fully neutral in terms of it's policy and that Ukraine will not be a threat to their national security. This should have been done really before there was any chance for conflict. The territories bordering non NATO states and that of Russia need a neutral zone that is demilitarized like between North and South Korea.
Ukraine, stop fighting. Right now, your children’s lives are more important than the autonomy of your country. You’ll get your country back. Put down your ammunition. Your most powerful weapon is your mind.
Mr Putin you are not in position of any major condition. You are criminal of war.!!!
So West could stop sanctions only if it’s demands are met (whatever the demand might be)
And you believe Putin? Are you insane???!!
2 ARROGANT DICTATORS.  DISGUSTING
That is BS from Putin.  He started the war, and now wants to Ukraine stop Fighting?  NO WAY.  Who knows how many suicidal squadrons from Chechnya he has sent to do sabotage and/or kill Zelensky?  I would follow Zelensky's answer.  Putin HAS NO CREDIBILITY, TO HELL WITH HIM!!!  SLAVA UKRAINIA!!!!!
What a useless report, what does Putin want this week?  I would tell him people in Hell want icewater. He has betrayed his own soldiers who are out of food.  Putin is a war criminal who rules a police state, he needs to be stopped, so many weak sisters here, we will tell him our demands.
Hopefully o my God please may the peaceful resolutions Aand conditions continue thank you Lord ,amen
His boyfriend. Erdowan 2 turds together.
One of Russia's demands is for Ukrainians to stop stealing their trucks.
No country would stop fight and surrender to a dictator and no country make itself weak by not joining the safety provided by friendly countries. You do not own Ukraine and its people Mr mentally unstable Putin.
Putins demands a double double from In N Out, chocolate milkshake and for no more woman reporters in sports
Stupid putin dont talk just invade if you can.  This is your last time to become a military power. You dont have fund for building up military power again. Your economy is collapsing now. Release all your ammunition, and tank, jets.
So, Putin will only stop attacking if Ukraine surrenders? How generous!
Special economic operations will cease after Russia goes home and putin leaves office
NATO is the blood sucker for the NWO and has no interest in the Sovereignty of Ukraine.
Putin lies more than the white man did when making treaties with the native Americans.  He speaks with forked tongue.
and what are the demands?
Putin has gotten people’s attention now, his plan all along. Ukraine will probably have to fight alone if it wants independence and autonomy.
Since Ukraine are one of the thin line between of them, Russia didn't want Ukraine to join NATO because they didn't want to put themselves on jeopardy since they are not ally with their forces, they should not get close the threat to each other.
Confused about the relationship between the headline and content. Thought there might have been some progress made. Not so?
Pooptin, the demented dwarf, doesn't get to demand "conditions" for his cessation of hostilities in Ukraine, just as he doesn't get to demand that Sweden and Finland need his permission to join NATO if they want; he's not the dictator of the world, at least not yet. If he stays in Ukraine then there will be continued and increasing hostilities against him, both by Ukraine and other countries. If he withdraws then he can minimize his losses and try to preserve the combat effectiveness of his military. Pooptin has played the first card in this game and now he's going to have to play with the losing hand that he's drawn. The last thing Ukraine or any of the other countries should do in this is to accede to the demands of a brutal bully; appeasement of a bully never works.
White on white crime
I'll summarize Putin's demands: Ukraine must accept the permanent role of disarmed buffer state between mother Russia and all those dangerous, menacing nations to the west.  The only thing I see in the way of this demand is 35 million enraged West Ukrainian Cossacks. Why would anyone object to being a Russian doormat nation?
hhhh
Absolute Fucking Bullshit!! 💩💩💩
Condition #30: All NATO nations will demilitarize.
Soviet Union will be taken back to Russia's arm by these modern Russia's military. If that happens all EU will be at risk to diminish its economy, power, and empires. Russia won't stop grabbing back its former soviet members by their neck.
ww3 lets go
What a useless report. Obviously Putin will only consider stopping his aggression if he gets what he wants. Why did you bother preparing this, wasting our time and yours, if you have no information about what specifically he wants? Often this channel offers "news" only for the sake of saying something, hoping to get new subscribers. I have yet to see real news here, not to mention a proper analysis. Whatever "analysis" you offer is very basic and simple, like something you would prepare for a ten-year-old.
If European countries had not allowed people from Syria Libya. To take off residence, there might be room for Ukraine citizens. People that are not part of the EU membership, but technically the same lands. No one will say it out loud, they don't want a bunch of Russian speaking whites in their Nation. I always said USA, if caravans of hundreds of thousands of white Russians were trying to get into the country, Democrats would shut that border right down. Which is why Joe Biden and say the Union address said it's time to close the border. Timing a little odd don't you think.
Ukraine will be split in two or three countries.
EXTRM GOOD TIME FOR BUYING ETHERUM AND BITCOIN AND HODL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Putin has managed to take its people back into the 1940’s. Russia is finished. Third world country now
stop fighting? when your the one invasion?
That was a waste of time. Nothing of substance was said.
Putin will end Moscow's invasion when Ukraine surrenders.
State the demands of russia! This news is nonsense..
Putin is insane, he is saying that Russia will stop operation if Ukraine stops fighting, so does he expect the Ukraine military to fold their hands and see Russian soldiers overrun their country, the man lacks reasoning
A very demanding aggressor 🤔🤔
He acts as stupid as he looks
No, get out
I hope they settle this by letting Putin be a front line fighter. 🙄 .... He started this and won't let it end.
Putin is a blood thirsty  cold at heart evil murderer who doesn't care about anyone but himself, may the Lord God make him loose this senseless war.
And here is the counter offer: The war will end when Russian troops get the hell out of Ukraine, including Crimea, and Vladimir Butt-in appears in front of the ICC.
3 days of no netflix and disney must of taken its toll on putin
Blithering incoherent buffoon Biden and tobacco chewing Hick Harris are in desperation for your lives to be destroyed and they dictate democracy???
Putin Nazi 😈 stop
WOW!!!! The NERVE of pooootin Putin..He is acting like he owns the world..What a big SHAME ON YOUR FACE
Stop 🛑 the Invasion 💯  New President for Russia 💯
So what are the demands?
stupid reporter...many times you said putin set conditions but you never told what are those..non sense..
Still waiting for what Moscow’s demands are… 🤔🤦🏼‍♂️
The main battleground is in people's minds. Americans clap their hands, watching the fratricidal war. Ukraine is a bargaining chip for the purpose of obtaining excess profits of the US military-industrial complex. As long as the people of Eurasia and South America, Africa do not realize their place in the world, as long as the countries do not unite against the yellow revolutions in their countries, America as a state will flourish and other peoples will suffer. The principle - divide and rule, has been working for the last 400 years, since the genocide of the aborigines of America, the essence has not changed, the form has changed. We need to think about the future of the planet on the principle of equality of nations, a multipolar world and mutually beneficial cooperation. For these purposes, it is necessary to move the UN headquarters to Moscow, at least. Or create a commonwealth (union) of countries free from Nazism (SSNS), and put an end to the current UN. The UN organization has lost its effective role today, it has already fulfilled its functions, it cannot work with new problems, it does not have the legitimacy that it possessed in the last century, today the main decisions are put forward in favor of the United States, which should not be in fact. The USA must remain without the support of the SSNS, the mind on planet Earth must win. The SSNS site should be located in Moscow, its goal is to eradicate fascism in any form on the whole Earth. This platform will give countries the legitimacy to conduct special operations against Nazism, it will create a new image of Russia, it will destroy the image of fascism in people's minds, it will help Russians and all Christians around the world, and not only us, it will help undecided. It is urgent to make a decision, I do not see any other way to unite states around the axis of the SSNS.
Surrender to my oligarchs and then I will stop killing 🤯🤯 The same faith is waiting for Taiwan. Hong Kong already turned into a pariah  and really does not exist anymore.
Well...u have been warned. He said it clearly. Up to you. Dont blame it on Putin anymore
But what are the demands?
Evil Putin's demands?  They will all boil down to unconditional surrender.
ukraine wont surrender. so putin will continue until he crushes ukraine to rubble. even if it takes months.
No agreement made with Putin yet a worth the paper it’s written on
No way the 2 sides will reach an agreement with his unreasonable conditions.    This is going to escalate to WWIII.  This talk is so crucial yet both sides will refuse to give in.  Previous conditions 1 annexation of Crimea must be recognised 2 independence of Donbas 3 Ukraine must remain neutral He also insisted it is a military operation, so it is not a crime so that makes Zelensky's condition to compensate is invalid. To NATO  1 cannot send weapons 2 cannot send fighter jet 3 cannot sanction 2 out of 3 Nato had done so they bombed an airport today to warn NATO not to send fighter jets..
Either you are for this invasion, or you are against it If you are for it, you are a POS
I want to hear FROM Putin - not through WION.
Putin wants to get away from this mass killing by changing the focus of the conversation. He thinks he can fool the world.
Pudding can’t really take care of its own iceberg of a country properly, how the hell does he want to provide for Ukraine? They are not going to work and pay him taxes? His ideology has failed 4 5 times in the history of his own country. What is the point of having millions of Ukrainian hostage like millions of Iranians?
so He wants to get Ukraine before stopping  who will agree to that?
That means Biden won.  Greatest war president ever.
CLICK BAIT!! THEY WONT TELL US  WHAT THE DEMANDS FROM RUSSIA ARE ITS JUST THE SAME NARRATIVE AS ALL THE OTHER LIERS ARE TELLING US
Russia stop murdering first. The ukrainians are only defending themselves from a mad russian invasion. Stop your murder then ask for your conditions. Prove your accusations after you quit murdering innocent people. Including your own soldiers.
Hrmmmmmmm What are Conditions ????????????????????
He is giving noting  and still asking for something  he will never get and putin on the losing  side he nows he is a failed  dictator  and will be dead soon
Putin  is a bully 😤  Invade an Independent Country and want them stop fighting and meet with Putin's Demands . This sounds like Ukraine being rape by Russia
This shit is crazy let the so called higher up fight each other and I dont know all what's going on but America hummmm🤔
You can't trust the Kremlin
WION; "President Pooten" lmao 😆😆
Just put Zelensky and Putin in a ring, winner takes Ukraine. Insanity solved.
Ukraine president could had stop this since but no he wants to fight like there's anything to win
Mr P..on your part we need & wanna see  less talk & lot more do!
So since NATO is just biting their nails watching, it seems like the only factor is time.  The possible outcomes of the special military operation are  1) Play along with Moscow and be happy, which can mean surrendering the east. (likelihood 5%) 2) Continue fighting and lose the war after a very long and painful resistance, in which case you will lose all of ukraine territory and a many civilians. (likelihood 95%) 3 ) Continue fighting and after a huge toll, win the war and maybe even win Moscow and the rest of the region. (likelihood: 0.5%) 4) Nato and the west join and then Moscow goes berserk, we have WW3 and nuke each other (likelihood: 4.5%)  Christians and Jews know that this is very likely to be WW3 aka Gog vs Magog. right
Fucking clickbait
That’s 2 minuets I’ll never get back!
They have to meet russian demands, what about Ukrainian demands to live peacefully in their own country, Putin is not right in the head
This is such a terrible video, laziness and mistakes, at least repeat the conditions which were listed in the past and Ankara is Turkey's capital...how does it call Russia's invasion unacceptable?
I mprove your English please!
Jesu li to opet kljucna dva tjedna , dva po dva  , mjesec po mjesec dvije godine pandemije zloupotrebe u kovid fasizam, sta sad u ratu ???  Dogovaraju se sa stola na sto dok zrtve svih strana,  nastavak  starog u novo . Zanimljivo....
putin farai la fine di hitler
This told me nothing. Of course he won't stop unless his demands are met. What are his demands?
He wants Ukraine to relax and give up
sei un uomo pazzo ,
So? WHAT are the "demands"?
You guys never said anything about the 1.3 million ( refugees) to the west that were already there. Screw you!
The world has just started dismantling murderous Russia. Get rid of Putin and save yourselves. the Planet is against you Russia. Russian soldiers Lay down your weapons and refuse to participate in murder.
Attention! Putin is now wanted for War Crimes punishable by death. If he stops he's a dead man. You're a fool to think he will stop now. The people fleeing knows what's going to happen. I'm not a praying man but I did last night. 🙏  GOD bless Ukraine & the World 🌎.
Back in 1992, the Ukrainians let go through the 14th Russian Army led by the Russian General Aleksandr Lebed (died in 2002 in a helicopter crash)  in order to reach the Romanian territory of Transnistria and fight the Romanians (Moldavians). Well, dear neighbors Ukrainians it's the pay back time and live what my Romanians lived back then. You should also consider to give back the foreign territories you hold illegally since 1945 such as Southern Bessarabia, the Snakes Island, Northern Bukovina and the Hertza County. Also, you may consider the territories due to Poland, Russia and Slovakia. Despite that, Romania accepts thousands and thousands Ukrainian refugees, giving them shelter, food, water, medicine and free transportation if they want to go further to West. What is pretty strange, most of those refugees laugh at the border.
The displays of malignant masculinity are sickening.  The lack of empathy is terrifying.
What are Putin's demands
Poor reporting! never said what those conditions were.
We need to take out every EVIL CORRUPT DANGEROUS leadership of every country in the world. Not their job to be tyrants.
Sounds like a deal only a fool could suggest or accept.
Amazing to realize  the James Webb Space Telescope  may, in a short time,  discover new Earth like  exoplanets,   worlds  humanity may some day visit...
Ukraine, just surrender and it will stop!!! Then you can talk about it. Zelensky thinks easy on remote telling people to fight and defend. People are DYING!
so stupid, Ukraine is not fighting, they defending!
“We demand that our demands are met”
Who will trust ever Fuhrer Putin after his lies last week that his troops were only at the Ukrainian border just for exercise purposes: he should be a real dummy!
He wasn’t very specific
What are moscows demands? Seriously, thats the story.
Putin is defeated his humiliation will be the end of an  empire. Remember  the Old Testament of how 100,000 Assyrian Army simply disappear before the onslaught.
Do not bow to tyrants
It seems to me that what Ukraine is doing and the western sanctions already has Russia on it's knees so why agree to any of Putin's demands?
I think the rest of the world is being fooled by the media again.  Putin is stopping the Globalists from complete takeover.  He is forcing people to recognize SWIFT which is THE bank where all money of the world is controlled.  Ukraine is home to Burisma. Why is no one talking about a conflict of interest with the current Resident in the WH and his son, Hunter B?  They are so indebt to the Ukraine right now...
Putin has lied about multiple things since this started. His words mean nothing.
Well putin   no deal erdogan since putin is playing hard ball
Europe is getting exactly what all the major players were working for for the last 8 years. They forgot that sponsoring Nazism sometimes backfires.
The conditions of a lunatic who wants to destroy everything that is not in favor of him
This is completely unacceptable!  Moscow started this and they must pay reparations and repair or replace everything they have damaged/destroyed.  Putin must surrender himself to the international court to answer for his crimes!
Please DO NOT meet his EVIL demands.   Since he is so "Great"......should double the effort to encourage him to continue with his  Special Mjlitary Operation so that the rest of the non-evil countries can  continue with their Special Economic Operation that he seems to be "enjoying"
Zelensky thinking: I was wasting my time with India, I should have talked with Erdogan instead.
What are those conditions other then Ukraine stop fighting?
He’s getting desperate!!!
You cannot trust Putin, he has lied at every opportunity concerning the Ukraine invasion.     We should insist on regime change and refuse to deal with Putin on the basis he is a War Criminal.    We should only accept his leaving power and deal with his replacement.   In the meantime continue with the sanctions and bring Russia to economic collapse.
Someone will take him out
Why u didn't mention any of the psychopath's demands?  Seems like u read titles.  Lol Actually  this war proved all world that Russia  isn't the superpower they pretended to be. With tired and depressed soldiers only dropping bombs from place to place, tanks from 80', 90s. What TF Is Putin talking about? Keep threatening with nukes. 😂
Talk talk, all is nonesense..
Putin putting an end to world pandemic and now the wardemic begins
They killed Jesus.  Kill this evil piece of manure, and now. The whole world would rejoice and be free.
I personally don't trust Putin for his own sets of condition, he's a a Traitor, Killler, may  God forsake him for his wrongdoing. Now, the whole world have seen and hear of  what our fellow men  had undergone.
This is a joke, stop fighting and let you take over?
Russia doesn’t dealing with terrorist and who’s the biggest terrorist in world ? America, Ukraine and Australians Government.
How about damage of ukraine countrys
When Russia is obliviated
After killing and destroying Ukraine people  🤪 Putin said I'm done to test my weapon  then he declared to end this war for his it's a military exercises 🥴
I'm from turkey and we love Russia Ukraine president must be changed he is stupid and dog of America and nato other country not scared anymore USA nato there 🗑️🗑️🗑️🗑️🗑️🗑️🗑️🗑️🗑️🗑️🗑️
What ARE Moscow's demands???
Russia can suck it
You can invade a country to  demand things so you can stop invading them . Brilliant why didn't someone think of this sooner. 😂😂😂😂
the nato and eu specially america, should know how to respect each countries and boundaries..what putin doing right now is just he only protecting his country to the entruder who only wants the goodwill  of his country. Respect is the solution,is america can do that?
So what are the demands?
Ukrainians are fighting for the world. If Ukraine falls Putin will stop at nothing to Make Russia Great again which means the Iron curtain is back.
Russia is getting scared, he’s bitten off more than he can chew, Putin the meglamaniac will end up in The Hague for genocide and war crimes😡
we want peace in the world. we ought to talk for peace. we are living in the mature world. God wants peace and Satan wants war. million time talk is better than war.
So when Ukraine stops fighting the dirty side, Putin, will escalate, just like he did when he said there was a ceasefire to let people out of the country….look how that turned out
He starts the war. Attacks civilian buildings, will grant a ceasefire but Ukraine must not join Nato?  He must have Ukraine helpless.  Nato is his Achilles heel.
I prefer die fighting that be ruled by another country, Ukraine won’t surrender
ukraine 🇺🇦 must stop the fight and surrender now... If not ukraine will fall...👎 Love ❤️ turkey 🇹🇷 and putin 🇷🇺 👍
The aggressor is suffering a badly broken nose, next is his jaw !  God bless the innocent public of ukfaine xx
Putin set condition ? What he think he is..... Trying to dictate sovereign country Of what he want.... What he want is to make his own puppet ......the independent sovereign country .... Maybe the sunction effect now to him and the Russian people...it will hard for Russian in coming day to come ... All of this is made by Putin ......course of his paranoia of the cold war .....
🇹🇷AnnCaaraa imposing sancktions on Russia is like a pauper refusing to   donations to an emperor😂😂😂
What's the DEMANDS!! Stop click baiting! There's no time for that bullshit!
Putin, you are more evil than Satan himself. Slava Ukraine! 🇺🇦
The Ukrainians WILL NOT stop fighting until ALL of “Putin‘s Puppet Soldiers” get their arses OUT OF UKRAINE and NEVER RETURN !!!!!!!
Putin asks for the moon 🌙.
Shouldn’t be up to the aggressor to set conditions…..
Don't stop fighting Ukraine as when ya do he keeps pushing forward.. his a liar...
each countries all over the world are not rivals each civilians in each countries are not enemies its just the  president in each country are the rivals or enemy because of there ego,greediness,madness,craziness.if they want war let each president in that countries fight not those innocent people
u could just talk about the demands as well not just saying demands being met lol
And you believe them
Those who are still living in the dark side of this world always wanted proves that there's a God. But they failed to understand that God lives in us through the holy Spirit, thereon the only way to know that God is real: is to cross over from darkness to light, and to accept Jesus as their savior. Then God will change their nature and give them new identities. Ultimately they can be filled and be led by the holy Spirit to become new creatures.
That was a lame video....
Putin will only stop attacking Ukraine  if the Ukrainians stop fighting??? Maybe instead Putin stop attacking first then Ukranians will not be needing to fight. Simples!!!
What demands?!!!
Putin thought that this war would be a walk in the park.  He threatened anybody supporting Ukraine. With consequenses nobody didn’t even dare to think about.  BUT the Ukrainian people stayed firm and didn’t back down. Which gave the rest of the world courage to step up and confront Putin,despite the gruesome threats. He’s own people turned against him. The world turned against him with his people. Everybody knows that this is not the will of the great and humble people of Russia.  Only the Russian people can stop this conflict.  Let them know,that we will back them up every step of the way.  The world can’t afford another global war.  And in war there’s no winners.  We should have learned that by now!!!
NATO should call his bluff, no response, all members just break communications and go completely radio silent for about a week and see what transpires. A lot can happen in a week. You gotta play hardball like Kennedy, it's the only thing they respect.
Putin's start's the war and everything must stop on his terms he's murdering cold-blooded hateful swine
Sanctions are an act of war? What would he call bombing Russia and their citizens? Like he's done to Ukraine. Little shit.
Putin=Butcher of Ukraine
So what are Moscow's demands to get this war to end peacefully? Ukraine is a sovereign country and the people there want peace. The world expects Ukraine to remain a sovereign nation. It should be easy to agree on conditions of NATO expansion if Russia also agree not to invade Ukraine and respect borders of sovereign nations. Actually NATO is a crazy waste of money and NATO should propose a roadmap for Russia to join NATO at some point in the future. It would allow disarming the insane nuclear arsenals that are currently in existence and put focus on peace and defensive actions rather. After Russia joins NATO in the future, we can eventually turn NATO off and define a global concept of sharing defense if one rogue nation start invading or attacking another nation.
Bennett is the man! ✡ ✌
I say we give Putin a war. The world has the ability to smash him and his allies forever.
Hurry up and stop fighting my fuckin gas prices are getting to high
What if the world demands to not put anymore sanctions  on their country of Putin steps down or stop invading sovereign country. If not, Ukraine will move forward all the way to Moscow..
Putin cannot be trusted..how can he demand that Ukraine should  stop fighting when they are only just trying to defend themselves from the onslaught he launched on them unannounced?he wants them to back down first so he can declare himself winner and then occupy Ukraine and turn it to his territory just like Crimea?he is insane and needs to be stopped.
These demads sound like he's asking them to surrender you got to be joking.
Meet Putin's demands ?! First of all, he is a war criminal. He is also a terrorist! He has murdered hundreds of Ukrainians as well as his own soldiers who are fighting under his directives. Many innocent civilians, including women and children are being murdered by Vladimir Putin's so called "invasion/operation" or whatever the hell he is calling it. This is a war ! It is an illegal, unethical, barbaric act ! Ukraine is fighting back hard. Russia may just get their asses kicked !!!!
A comedian is going to ruined his country !! better to step back with Rus than begging US sympathetically and make peace for his people.
Russia, kiss our ass!!!!
What's happening to the Indian students stranded in Ukraine?
L. T. NATAS WILL DICTATE TO PUTIN WHAT TO DO - EXCRUBASSA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Russia to wicket punish them urkarine to many your people suffer the cry
So to be perfectly unclear…Moscow’s conditions for ending the invasion are that Moscow’s conditions for ending the invasion are met.  Did anybody read this “story” out loud before airing?
The majority of Finnish people have expressed a desire to join NATO. Since Russia has no historical claims to Finnish territory, Putin has no right to oppose Finland joining NATO.
I support 🇷🇺
What a uselesd video. All it says is Rissia sets conditions over and pver. Never said what the conditions were.
🇷🇺  🇷🇺  🇷🇺  🇷🇺  🇷🇺  🇷🇺  🇷🇺  i love putin he is the man
Putin is a liar. Don't believe anything he says.
The Ukrainian government needs to sacrifice some of its freedom to save the lives of its people and to avoid sacrificing its people instead.
We already know the guy is evil snd now  the question is you willing to grant his demands knowing what he is capanle of doing at any time.🤔
Russia hat no conditions to set! The bastards all belong to jail! And shame on India for not helping Ukraine!
What are putins demands ?
Plèase president putin  you have the power and might to stop this killing on both sides please be seen as a man of peace you and you alone have the power to do this im irish and have the privlage to have a russian niece also  my single name is lennon  i hope with all my heart you get to read this  god bless and keep the whole world safe
He is going to get what he wants one way or another.
Not an option, Russian government need to retreat from Ukraine 🇺🇦 and then negociaciones
a "very special" President started a "special" war
Putin realising he fucked up.. BADLY.
If it wasn't because of American Javelin and Stinger Also Ukrainian and those American and British volunteers bravery , Russia would have conquered Ukraine in the first day.
People's lives are more important than sanctions
The Kremlin needs a new hole in its roof.
URRRA GO RUSSIA PUTIN is my hero.
I give urkarine right boom them putting
They have to stop fighting first? ITS THEIR DAMNED COUNTRY!
Abnormal PUTIN So You want UKRAINE To be able To Surrender?
Do those conditions include him rebuilding everything and paying back everything... he can't replace lives
from Japan  Everyone, please help Ukraine. Many people are killed every day in Ukraine. We must show the progress of humankind, not same as before.  Please remember Malala. One child, One teacher, and One pencil can chenge the world. Let's all help  Ukraine, beat cruel terrorist Putin by posting your comments on YouTube.
So what are moscows demands?
Putin would insist with his demands. He wont back down now since he already lost face.
Basically, Putin still has dreams of conquering the world and Nato is in his way like after WW2. He seemed to be ok with controlling the nukes in Ukraine, which borders Nato and Europe, but he won't allow Nato to do the same.  He's a dickhead that needs to be taken out, because this is all pointless. This move serves no purpose except for Russian vanity.
Dearest V.Putin Darling! It is written! For with God nothing shall be impossible. Lk.1:37.
Project Barbarossa II going full steam ahead. Google it.
Poland will join war aswell as all countries globally, because putin used banned vaxuum lung toxic thermobaric bombs. Putin nazi hitler fascist! We are coming for You.  Anonymous, France, Paris.
I don’t believe a word Putin says , he will exploit any agreement.
Conditions. To stop killing women and children....
Putin to bold face went he Putin killing out the urkarine people let he Putin stop the booming first and fix their country urkarine back how it was yess let him fix back
Russia was the one picking a fight I say fight on
Russia is Germany and Ukraine is Poland
Adolf Putin the Monster of Moscow must be stopped! 🏴
Putin is no ones friend He has a grudge he is holding on to.
⚔️And there it is: Putin’s dictating to a free and Democratic countries Government; to let him just walk in then take it over?!🛡
1, Putin has demonstrated he can’t be trusted by showing he doesn’t honor agreements. 2. Putin’s demands are nothing short of complete capitulation 3. Ukraine has not attacked Russia and it is Russia that must stop and remove their troops. 4. Ukraine is an independent Democratic country with every right to discern its own future without Russian interference. 5. Actions committed by Putin and his troops are war crimes and punishment/reparation must be part of an agreement. 6. Putin is extorting the rest of the world by threatening a nuclear response to keep us at bay. The threat itself shows the barabarity and instability of Putin.
Why are these country's interfering, France Isreal Turkey?, he means what he says ,which is complete surrender of all weapons and a full de militarisation of the Ukraine, guarantees on the Ukraine not joining Nato and severing it's links. The Ukrainian people to vote in a new government .save yourself a phone call lmao. 😂
What kind of nonsensical video is this repeating same sentence 10 times? Not expected from wion. And there were no details of Putin's demand in the video anyway... 😂😂😂  Absolute rubbish of a video.
No way!
Russia people want to get out as sanctions ruin their lives
Is it the same Erdogan To this day occupying Cypress?  The hypocrisy Most of these nations if not all that’s pointing the finger at Russia are themselves imperialist occupiers invaders of other countries
In other words, if they surrender completely, I will stop attacking them. That sounds like an invading conqueror if ever there was one.
Fu Putin!
I will go away only if you stop retaliating... says the bully.
Who the hell does Putin think he is. He is a despicable, horrid mother and baby killer. Your day will come Mr Peutin. The world leaders will see to it.
Moscow's demands is for Ukraine to ben over and kiss their ass.
I hope the ex-comedian president realized that he was also at fault. NATO was the first to blame as they ignore the WARSAWPACT. NATO violated its own agreement.
from Japan  Everyone, please help Ukraine. Many people are killed every day in Ukraine. We must show the progress of humankind, not same as before.  Please remember Malala. One child, One teacher, and One pencil can chenge the world. Let's all help  Ukraine, beat cruel terrorist Putin by posting your comments on YouTube.
What a cheeky plick
Moscow is a city ... it isn't capable of thought or speech, let alone invading other countries or the making of demands !
Abu Huraira reported: The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said, “Time will pass rapidly, knowledge will be withdrawn, tribulations will prevail, greed will be cast into hearts, and there will be many upheavals.” They said, “What is upheaval?” The Prophet said, “It is killing.
What are the demands? How come they are not telling it why? Because we all know russians demands are fair the  problem nato and its allies don't want it.. It will  stop their real agenda.
Russian jet and chopper is for sale 50% off because of substandard and can not function properly on combat,  indian is interested to buy the 50% off sale
If I were the Ukrainian general there I would send the Russian attackers a message with one word,    NUTS.
I would NOT trust putin he is a big Liar.
🤣🤣🤣🤣
"If Moscow's Demands are Met" .... yea don't think their Demands will be met.. Ukraine is not just going to Give up. so...
Doesn't tell us what the demands are.
Thank you Lord,your love will be triumph.
Crappy report! What are Moscows demands.. Thumbs down 👎 unfollowing
The agressor has the guts to make a demands thats beyond acceptable by the ukranians nobody surrender without a fight
Garbage news,you just want to make money from viewers for doing nothing,you are an opportunist.
when a person who is parentless or born from crazy parents became the dictator of a country......., the whole world suffer.
i always wonder what the purpose is of a comment without the commented speech. Why can't we hear what Putin has to say? And THEN you comment.
Zelensky should stop fighting Nato and US war and come to his senses. This is a lose-lose situation for him and more so for his people.
PRAISE GOD AND STOP THE MADNESS! UKRAINE! BUILD THE WALL! BUILD YOUR MILITARY UP! AS ALL OF EUROPE SHOULD! STOP BUYING RUSSIAN OIL! LET'S GO BRANDON! FJB! my opinion! RUSSIA only wants peace now? Because they are loosing! And want to save face? THEY NEVER SHOULD HAVE INVADED! IN THE FIRST PLACE!  AND UKRAINE! PLEASE STOP DEALING WITH THE RESIDENT AND THIEF in d.c.! obiden and his methhead son! Are NOT WORTH IT! PRAISE GOD! STAY FREE!
🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇯🇴🇯🇴🇯🇴🇵🇰🇵🇰🇵🇰☝🏽
So you're gonna tell me that there are conditions but won't tell me what they are? Is it because is a condition that was already established but stubborn westerners can't simply comply? Maybe it has do with a certain country not joining a certain organization that will put Russia at a disadvantage? Don't be shy, media. Tell us the conditions.
The UN also referred to the displacement of people in Luhansk / Donetsk / Donbas as 1.5million.
Putin can go to hell !!! And prosecuted for war crimes !!!
What the point? Another words give him what he wants
So the conditions are "We'll stop if we win"? big surprise. Highly sensationalized and clickbait.
I think it is magnanimous of Putin to come to the table and start peace talks.
This is a non-story.  Russia's demands will never be met by Ukraine and the West because they are ridiculous.  This is not a story at all!
Thank you Turkey, very cool.
The real current obstacle is the comedian Zelensky the lapdog of White House is not looking the interest of Ukraine people but US !
Moscow whatever doesn't leave the Ukranian ministers, collect all evidences of biochemical weapons which they are destroying fast,. Go Russia Go ❤️🇷🇺
Leave Russia and Ukraine do the talks and nato stay out of it.
ดี เที่ยงตรง สำนักข่าวในไทยส่วนใหญ่ดราม่า
Take down the NWO!!! 😂😂😂😂
USA and NATO should listen to the President of the whole world MR Putin if they don't want to be next take a look at Ukraine = next
Oh look another Indian state sponsored channel that loves Russia
Um but what are Moscow’s demands…
Putin's words are like poison to your ears.
I don't see why not
Putin has gone mad, why should Ukraine stop fighting when Russia started it. Bloody sick man
If the western world don't know by now it's to intervene with military power and help Ukraine, then they are just waiting for puttin to think he can make more demands with his stupid threats of a nuclear weapon strike that might never happen but this war on the west has already started and NATO forces are doing nothing!
Putin will still have to pay the price,he’s a criminal,
Putin will need conditions to allow him to run with his tail tucked
If ukraine stops fighting? Maybe if russian stops invading, then ukrain would stop fighting
under Russian control will be better then under USA...specially for EU
So what are Moscow’s demands?  Maybe a reminder would be good.
Erdoğan is a Slimmy Wiesel, he can't be trusted,  he speaks from both sides of his mouth
Its very simple,dont join ukrain in nato,the war end
Fucking stupidest shit I watched didn't inform bout anything
Putin offers peace but Zelensky demands war. Ukraine deserves its fate.
I can almost here Ukraines reply to his terms. Shove your head up arse and keep it there.
what are the conditions?
IF NATO DOES NOT BELIEVE WE ARE BEING ATTACKED FOR PUTINS EGO ROMANTIC BELIEVE THAT THE EASTERN UNION HAS BEEN TACKEN FROM HIM AND A PYSCOTIC NEED FOR MONEY🤑🤑🤑💀💀 HE IS A PSYCHOLOGICAL NIGHTMARE WE HAVE SEEN ONE ITEM AFTER ANOTHER WHILE HIS RUSSIAN CAPT I VES CITIZENS HAVE  😭🙈🙉💩 TOLIETS TO POOP IN!  END HIS KILLING HE WONT STOP !
"if Ukraine stops fighting....." what a great demand from a madman, seems putting the blame to Ukraine who's only defending itself from Putin's war.
So Zelensky will die to be in Nato. He loves Ukranians so much.
And can you let us know about the civilians that were targeted by Saudi/ US forces in Yemen 2 days ago
The world is afraid of Putin.
And what are "the" demands pls? Someone enlighten me
Putin is already looking for a way out to save face.
This video may have been the best nonreporting piece I've ever seen. If it wasn't for the comments I'd have absolutely NO idea what the demands were. Swing and a miss :(.
Great news coverage about the Russian conditions, that newscaster *Never Stated what those Conditions are!  Is Russian wanting to execute all the Politicians and their families, demand all companies be owner by Putin himself or eject all the corrupt Ukrainian politicians and establish and interim government acceptable to both Russia and the Ukraine people, who knows the report about the conditions never said what the were.
Putin will cease fire if Ukraine will surrender unconditionally, never join NATO, have no weapon to protect Ukraine and all Ukrainians will be Russia's slaves. He thinks that Ukrainians are idiots, cowards are slaves. He is out of his mind. Ukraine is not yet lost. Fate will smile and Ukrainian enemies will vanish. God bless Ukraine.
2 dictators together how nice
PUTIN TRIED FIST BUMPING BUT GOT LEFT HANGING  ON BIG NATIONAL T.V. 1:16  FUCKIN' CLASS... lool
I suggsst zelensky surrender
Putin is a criminal
If he continues war he will no sooner be able to put conditions.Putinnn putout...putin putout ...parody song
Putin will not get it. I know.
%^&$%^& OFF PUTIN
How to say something and nothing at the same time
After he made a big damage of lives on both sides including sanctions 🤣😁😭
The biggest " refugee problem" in Europe?  Not counting the millions of non European " refugees" of course.
Breaking Breaking Russia has demands, Breaking Breaking Russia has demands. However we will not tell you the specifics or if they have CHANGED from previous demands. LOL
Hello idol sir Vladimir putin good morning have a nice day god bless
III WOULD WAR? time to leave the cities? 👀☢️🔥😰
Ukraine will never stop fighting. Surrender to Putins means they are prisoners in their own country.
Putin is the best
Evacuate mothers and children as soon as possible from Russia.
Does not matter what the conditions are. Just talks to keep everyone busy while he continues on his murdering spree. Nothing will come of this.
If you give in to Putin's demands this time, who's to say he won't turn around and invade Ukraine again or Poland, Finland or Estonia. Bring Putin and his economy to their weakest level since WW2
Tell Putin we will fight you but no nuclear weapons
He's asking for an unconditional surrender, how about you take the capital before you start asking for shit aye
Putin's conditions: 1) You have to give up. 2) Be subdued.  Nah Tiny Vlad, It does not look like an attractive offer.
Nah let's keep the killing going
Just end this killing! Is no price for human life.
yeah, well, WHAT are the demands and who the f---is Erdogan ?  Is he the correct mediator ?
He’s fucked!!! And he just admits it.
He started the war. He places conditions. Ukrainians are lucky. When will the Russians get their freedom?
The U.S. knows this situation quite well. They invaded Iraq, claiming Saddam had weapons of mass destruction, but none were found. So I guess Putin can make the same kind of claims too. 😉
No shit! You literally told us NOTHING and repeated that on loop for 2 min.. lousy reporting.
What are the demands?  why did you waste our time-  tell us what these demands are?
What a useless news channel.
Its a good NEWS
Conditions? He has no right to ask for conditions..pack your bags and go to venezuela
This is a war with no winner. Both sides need to sit down and talk. Please stop fighting
Tell Ukraine to STOP 🛑 fighting.. wait , what that supposed to mean ??? Just give us a free pass !!!!!! Let us walk all over yo and you are not going to make a sound
Where is America's might we once had
so why not tell the demands so we can all hear them
What demands?
If Ukraine stops fighting first ? It is the aggressor that must stop first on the contrary, he can afford it as he is stronger and not yet totally isolated !
The people of Ukraine will never surrender
USA and NATO are supplying neo nazis arms,and so are the general public of the west who are donate funds that will end up in neo nazis hands,these millions of brainwashed people have no idea whats truly going because of the western media,you would have thought that the IRAQ war would have shown just what the media are.
Putin is loser🤣
We should not negotiate with terrorists?
Putin wants no nation that borders Russia to join NATO, but it aint always that simple, he wants the minerals, the pipelines, the who shabang.
Never going to happen.  Vlad the mad! Free peoples having just being attacked are going to roll over to a bully. This is all mad.. as Brezhnev... said Russia was safe from invasion so long as they had more nuclear  missiles than anyone else. Russian policy and this is true by Russian leaders in 20th C. No one is going to invade Russia... Russia however DOES invade its neighbours....... that is why NATO exists... 30 smaller nation.. an attack on one is an attack on all. This news channel jeep referring to NATO as the West as if it is the same thing and as if Russia has been backed in by NATO. You cannot stop smaller nations scared of NATO wishing to join NATO.. this is not the West or NATO or the US....  smaller countries are with good reason scared of Russia!!  If the people of India do not understand this like the rest of the world  Then India is backward and lied to by its own new media.....
So Nato and the US are scared because Putin has Nukes so no help for Ukraine, so the nest time he invades he will still have Nukes and the next time and so on. So why not just give up to Putin now? If can't every do anything ever cause of his nukes, well he will always have them so break out the Vodka and  "do svidaniya"  (good bye in Russian) free world.
Can't stop WW3 if we don't start now!!! It's like a cancer.
this site is communist and edits comments
Putin isnt longer in the Position of setting conditions
Every country that has Dictators  Suck!
What were the demands? Stop planning to invade Russia? Yolo.
Not one from Ukraine is responsible for war but all top notch people not analysing situation properly are all responsible for war and deaths, politics is not understood, public  is facing the the impact of war unfortunately
The fact that Putin censors all Russian media is a damning admission of a criminal Dictator
The demands from both sides are a good way to ensure nobody ever agrees to anything.
Today honor to the Ukrainian soldiers and total dishonor to the Russian soldiers. Anyone who threatens and guns down defenseless people is a coward.
Its fucken Putin who is fighting. The Ukrainian are only defending themselves
USA and NATO are as much responsible for this war as Russia. They kept provoking and instigating Russia, despite Putin been very clear since past 8 years, that he will not accept NATO expansionist policies on its borders.   US is real winner in this geo politics game, it instigated foolish Ukrainians in their day dreams to become NATO members, and indirectly left no choice for Putin and forced Russia into this conflict. US has now galvanized whole West to sanction Russia. This is what US wanted since end of cold war, to somehow take revenge from Russia and to humiliate Russians. Without getting engaged, and without firing a single bullet, US has played the politics game to its advantage. The scapegoat in US and Russian war of superiority has been the foolish Ukrainians.   US is equally responsible fir this situation, What harm Russia was doing to US that it had to keep poking Russians, by wanting to bring nuclear weapons on Ukrainian and Russian borders.  Unfortunately poor Ukrainians and humanity are the victims in this greed of military superiority. This war will end the moment US stops NATO expansion, which is nothing short of military gang which was created against erstwhile Soviet Union. The reality is no one wants to end this war, including Biden.
Who attacked who? Putin is a laughing stock 🤣
Putin 👍❤️❤️🇷🇺❤️❤️🇷🇺💪
Putin is desperate and trying to bluff his way out of things now otherwise he wouldn’t be talking about conditions to stop. He lost days ago and has caused a great amount of damage and embarrassment to Russia which there is no coming back from while he is there, time to eat your bullet Putin, the world no longer believes a word you say, more and more of your own people stop believing you everyday also
I'm guessing Putin didn't mention anything about paying Ukraine war reparations
Once again old news from an over excited repetitive WION reporter. Please come back when you have some real news to report. Several countries`  leaders have appealed to Putin to stop his madness but he needs medical help.
Thank you lord no war finally stops
So Putin wants Ukraine to stop fighting, let Russia walk over them and do as they are told? Not exactly the best negotiating skills with that dumbass
What are the demands to stop this menace.  Why can you mention it?
Very good job... May peace Will come as soon as possible....  Thanks Mr Erdogan dan Mr Putin... ❤️✍️
Is it clear???
the whole war was a destruction of canadians freedom convoy nothing else,,,
Breaking news: Putin set conditions to end Moscow's invasion. Expanded news: Putin set conditions to end Moscow's invasion.
How do you put down conditions when you are actually loosing the war??
How can I call Biden and Putin and cuss them out?
Basically he wants them to give in.
Putin did not set conditions to end the war, those are conditions for Ukraine to surrender.
Two minutes of repeating the caption over and over, nothing else. If you read the caption, don't bother watching the video. Oh, except a mention of Turkey's president offering to act as mediator.
putin is asking for ukraine to roll over? as he boom & kill a lot of ppl?
Putin has no right to set conditions, he is an idiot.
Erdogan trades guns with both countries and is also just another dictator so...
I mean the conditions are what NATO stop expanding Eastward and Ukraine to Demiliterize
Now Zelensky must agree with this conditions and the war ends. Sounds nice. But Zelensky is a comedian-actor as president, so I'm not sure that's possible.  He thinks he is the main star in a Hollywood movie, and he will sacrifice all his citizens is it's needed just to have an heroic ending.
You haven't said anything other than Russia has demands and won't stop till their demands are met. The Ukrainians having to stop fighting is kinda a given! So basically you haven't said $hït!
Putin you need to surrender , it's over, you lost , and the rest of the world is behind Ukraine
This is not the operation this is Genocide of Ukrainian nationality 🇺🇦
Putin please don't end it now, was looking forward to seeing racists countries fall. 🙏🇷🇺🙏  Long live Russia!!!
so what are are Moscow's demands , u didnt mention that.
Wion news and updates from Palki Sharma Upadhyay are such a great source of information. I have to pause and play sometimes because she is so good not to include any redundancy or fillers when she talks. Why is this news report like this? The entire time the reporter repeats herself but doesn't even mention it once what are the conditions to stop the war.
Putin is right from the beginning. Zelensky is a globalist .he made this war.
Can you pls drop atomic bomb in Moscow. Thanks.
0:40 seems like a good guy ? okay so what are the demands?
Thank you
You cant let Hitlers demands control the outcome.People like Putin need to be erased from reality or else everyones reality becomes twisted.
World War I  Date 28/7/1914  28+7 + 19 + 14 = 68  World War II Date 1/9/1939  1 + 9 + 19 +39 = 68  Invasion of Vloraime Date 24/2/2022  24+2 +20 +22 = 68
In other news: Water is wet!  Maybe someone should share those demands eh... You know...Specifically? Might be useful.
Putin must respect the  rights of innocent  people as we are all equally b4 the eyes of almighty God : earthly titles means nothing; lastly the whole world is more important than an individual :amen.
Don’t forget about God.  Judgement day is coming
😂
and ucraine must demand rusia ti pay for everything that's been destroyed .
What does Putin want now???
Putins demands are clear . Give me Ukraine . From that i will install a huge  military base in Ukraine with nuclear missiles .
Whats next? North Korea invades South Korea?
Sooooo what are the conditions??? All I heard you say was the same thing over again for 2 minutes and showing the same clips over again and again
I'm sure if the war between russia and ukraine end it will put hate on Ukrainian people towards russians.. they will never live equally like before
WHAT ARE THEESE DEMOANDS FROM MOSCOW
I do not think that Russia/Putin is in a position to make such demands...   Ukraine won't stop fighting until the last Russian tank has left Ukraine, I would expect, so those demands are very outlandish for starters.
I mean the Russians are going to retreat and there's no war oh that might be good news and if that happens then the stock market might go up Monday oh s*** what about that short all along puts
... So... what are the demands?
REALLY? So why start.. so many life's lost.
The russians really made a mistake with Ukraine ... They just wanted to join the EU not NATO, they wanted a better life and a different government, after what happened in Crimeea that made them to want to join NATO ... Look at Serbia for example they want to remain neutral, they just want to join EU, they are also prorussian ... Russia lost it's ties with Ukraine by their own mistakes
Putin demands give me Ukraine !!! I will make a high military nuclear base ready to fight nato .
I truly trust super power Russian president Putin  Because he’s doing his job to clean up and wipe out all corrupted country  Russian with loved 🥰 ❤️ Russian will win! 🥇🏆🗽
What were the conditions...lmao ..more backwards reporting...
Ukraine needs a no fly Zone , Stop being afraid of this Bully.. Come on NATO get a backbone.:
2 minutes later still no idea For this clickbait title
Putin will push on. He's a lying as usual... What's new nothing, same old shit.
Same old shit. The so called " Global Elite" fucking up innocent lives. Scumbag War Mongers deserve to Die, not the innocent people.
Ukraine stop fighting disarm allow mad Putin to install a puppet government install Russian military and deployment of nuclear weapons in Ukraine,    then Poland? Or he threatensww3  good luck on that one.
Putin is finished politicaly
Poor Russian army have proven to be so inefficient and extremely unreliable. And it all happened battling against a small nation army W/O any significant relevant technology. Can you imagine the dimensions of the disaster that the Russian army will experience, if Putin makes them fight against a true war specialized nation with centuries of real war experience, plus tons of secret technologies that nobody knows about, a nation with the capability and resources of developing and materialize whatever type of weapon they think they need, any time they want? We are talking about, automation, networking, ground forces, drones, underground, air, robotics, weather, stealth technologies, intelligence, space, I really mean all sort of stuff that you might and might not imagine is already done and functional and you don't even have the minimum idea! It's going to be a real surprise.
Putin's nickname should be Vlad the Impaler. He's acting just like him and it did not end well for him.
Don't trust putin
*The world doesn't want Ukraine to stop fighting, they keep sending arms, and now too mercenaries, so good luck with that one.  The world wants Ukraine completely destroyed, end of story !!!*
hes a liar you cant trust a word he says ...
War can stop when putler is destroyed..
He attacks an independent country, bombs their cities kills the people , tells RUSSIANS  A country the size of a peanut, that turned over their nuclear weapons to Russia  , was a danger to the Russian PEOPLE and about to attack him. No wonder republicans love him.
Use power to stop 🛑 nazi expansion either side.
If i was Zelensky the war woulda been over by now .He cld out nato for not helping with fighter planes .no fly zones ..and they wont help him ..that just shows there not trully have his back...so therefore id just join russia then ..russia is the real backup....end of war..if ukraine simply joins russia..
The mad man needs to be taken out!
Well fighting will surely stop when you GTFO of Ukraine!  And pay your war crimes, give them money to rebuild what you destroy sounds fair to me.
One more psychopath dictator to add to history .. can’t wait to see his dark future…
Ukraine should never have given up their nuclear arsenal
What are the conditions? This whole clip doesn’t tell us a thing.
Attact keyboard army
even if it stops somehow, the damage is already done,i like to see how russia will compensate for that.
NATO is responsible for this war in Ukraine  ! NATO should be disbanded and it's leaders brought to justice for starting this war.
It seems the west has small memory.  The Arab spring uprisings was a catastrophe for Europe due to displaced refugees.
May the Creator & 1000 angels destroy the aggressors Salam blessings healing & infinite Knowledge to all.. Star Gods...
Not to be trusted...he would only use the time to regroup and organize....this guy has committed war crimes against humanity and NOW he has conditions and demands ...Really?
There are no demands,just keep killing from a former KGB killer.
The condition to end war is for ukraine to forever be under russia control not nato or usa..simple
Clickbait
Terrorists make demands, leaders negotiate.
WHAT ARE THE FUCKING DEMANDS? THIS WAS AWFUL...
Sometimes this channel does a good job of explaining and other times it falls flat. This clip is the latter.....................
What’s the conditions and demands? What BS news reporting
Stand Strong Ukraine💙💛
I think turning Ukraine into a neutral state and not nato, same as Moldova then putin would cease military action
He is the aggressor. has killed innocent civilans & his own people in so doing. He doesn´t get to set conditions!
Keep going Russia, We believe in your Fight.
Does Ukraine belong to Putin
Some one neds to go and take Putin out of his bed over night  it can happen .
So that was 100% waste of listening too.
pay for the damages of the ukraine country or else,continue the sanctions.
I hate war the poor civilians suffered the most  I hope this ends soon 🙏
So in other words, NOTHING HAS CHANGED.
Putin is as credible and trustworthy like mafia.
Thanks, that's proper news delivered precisely as it should be, it's terrific to have an Anchor that tells the news not the opinions of the Anchor, Well done !!
He sets demands as if he own Ukraine and the world. I sense that P😈tin is now starting to feel the pressure and is afraid.
Thank you president putin
He's afraid of everything. No one can be near, won't use devices.... and NATO scares tf out of him.
Blah blah blah
One thing he forgot , there is more powerful  than him. (  Russian P.)  Almighty  God.  N more people praying  NO WORLD WAR 3 . VIRUS IS NOT EVEN OVER YET ,SO  GO TO HELL MAN . PRAISE GOD N GOD BLESS  THOSE PEOPLE' WHO  WANTS  A PEACEFUL  LIFE ..
so what putin said in his peace negotiations is, putin will stop bombing ukraine if ........ they surrender? lolol
Yugoslavia is the biggest refugee crisis in Europe since ww2.
who the  bloody hell does he think he is, if his demands are met, stuff you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
If true, it already shows how Putin does not want or need a 5 year war...
America has also set demands on how to end Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. Putin's conditions are unreasonable. He will continue to invade until he is stopped. And he will be stopped. The Russian people should realize that Putin will destroy their nation. He will go down in flames and he will destroy Russia before he is replaced.
Russia will halt its invasion if we take Putin and his Generals out of the equation.
This is worthless information
International law is null, void and useless when it isn’t being followed, no one gets prosecuted, and everyone is afraid of certain leaders.
And thr demands from Moscow are?
PUTIN IS A TERRORIST AND YOU DON'T NEGOTIATE WITH TERRORISTS
This reporting: It happens so much in the news. What are Moscow's demands?  I assume (but there's nothing said) that Putin wants Ukraine to become a "neutral" country like Switzerland and stop what he thinks is the West's encroachment in Europe.  Anyone know for sure? thanks!
He said Ukraine needs to stop fighting and agree to his demands.. Translation, unconditional surrender
ummmm what are the demands?
Putin. stop killing Ukraine citizens
how about Russia pays for damages it creates or gives the Crimea to ukraine. add in warcrimes as well
Dog Putin, he destroyed Ukraine, sanctions should be forever for Russia
Putin will be at the Great White Throne Judgement. This is just so evil. The worst since Stalin and Hitler.
ukraine to stop resistance then what?demand to take over ukraine?better off dead-nfg
Caint someone stop this nonsense before someone gets hurt ? Shit brab
The Central Banks are gonna have some conditions on releasing Russian money and credit.
WTF are the demands .....??!?!?!?
Moscow demands surrender and Russian military only in ukraine...... Stupid dimplomacy
1 millions for his head some sniper will do it for free could be is general a guard or a ingredient in his food could be anybody an more because the soldiers won t have a pay soon or the populations of Russia what don t tell me he did not tought abought this one ...
this reporting is terrible.
Putin is a liar.   Tell him to turn over 2 trillion dollars in US cash in escrow held by the United States of America then enter into a truce -- if you break the truce conditions you lose the money.
Well that was a waste of 2 mins 🙄😒
No retreat no surrender Spartans UK Birmingham city Zulus against bulllys racists godbless
he might as well have said "when pigs fly over the moon"
I stand with Russia
Set conditions but you have not said what exactly those demands aside from Ukraine to stop fighting..thanks for the info..
never ever bow your knee on putin..how dare he..how high u are the harder u fall putin
MORE SANCTIONS RUSSIA NEEDS TO BE BLACKLISTED FROM THE WORLD BANK
Bla bla. No real news!
Shithouse !
Go back USA.
Tell him 🖕 and he needs to give up his nukes seeing as he's a petulant child who shouldn't have them!
One demand - in practise-  puppet government and military oppression,  citizens without any weapons to fight, no freedom of speech or free media, corruption, etc. I am sure they will like that.
Here's some demands: leave Crimea, give back Kaliningrad, get the hell out of Ukrainia and do some democratic elections... Russia might join EU eventually.
Poertin we wil not stop now NAto allies wil not stop untill you step down and dissapear from russia go in to exile and dissapear for ever otherwhise we wil bring russia down an annlex 50% of russia in to nato
This news keeps repeating the same words like 3 times. Just tell the whole world what kind of demand smh
"I have a  brilliant peace proposal!"--------"What is  it?"--------""You surrender"
Demilitarized Ukraine was ine of his demands before😂 is he ok?
Well thats not going to happen.
Why doesn't she say what are those demands ?
2 in the noodle
No deal. The U.S. and its allies will continue to strangle Russia economically. A Russian business man already has a $1,000,000 bounty on Putin's head. That figure will grow to $25,000,000.
Well what are the damn demands, you guys don't say. What does the Turkish president have to do with anything.
He wants the A30B white supremisis militia to piss off (jews are white) and after 7 years of no water to crimea don't shut it off when he leaves...  lowering price to have his pipeline on ukraine might be another .... and oil of the north another
We need to take a look at the Biden families petroleum holdings in Ukraine and other places. I guess nobody remembers Hunter
Never ever negotiate with moronic putin who is losing!!!
misleading title, I though the conditions would be mentioned
they voted Zelesky  in to make war but did not repeat did not buy enough weapons so wearing their heart on their sleeves make videos for free weapons and money , good gig if u can get it, they voted for their President so ,  now country half destroyed  soon be over cause not fooling me cavalry isnt coming over to win this for them , cut a deal protect life , and limb of your people
It would be foolish for EU to go to war with Russia who have thousand of nuclear missiles. European love their way of lives, professional soldiers are only on duty from 9 to 5, weekends  are for family or the single will always find some water holes to past the time. Part timers seldom volunteer for weekend duties. On the whole they prefer to leave it to the gungho USA to do the fighting for them
If only that Ukrainians stop fighting how can they will not fight if you step in their country without an invitation and bombing them. God will bless Ukraine🥰😇🙏
I am inclined to believe that he just wants all Ukrainian resources under his control and for his personal benefit!!
So, Ukraine just needs to give up its existence and then the war ends? It's kinda like how a siege ends when the castle is taken over. You can be killed on a battlefield, in a prison camp or simply just fade out into nothingness with no country or home under your feet. The fact they offered this is superb diplomatic skills on display. Brilliant, just brilliant.
So nothing about respecting Ukraine's sovereignty and ending Russian occupation of a successful, independent democratic country.
Sign ukraine 🇺🇦 👌
Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God. Matthew 5:9
Good news: The same God that sits above us on the Throne, is the same God that is everywhere, and he was manifested in the flesh! His name is Jesus and he died for the sins of all (including the sin of unbelief, he nailed ALL SINS to the tree (Colossians 2:13-14) and took them away once for all (Hebrews 9:13; 10:10) so that God may be all in all! Evil will not exist with good who is God, forever, for it is written that God shall be all in all (1 Corinthians 15:28) Praise God, for he is a consuming fire of love and in him we literally live, and move, and have our being!!! The one who speaks the end from the beginning saw everything that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. 😇 God's will, will be done on and in earth as it is in Heaven. He has commanded everyone to repent (Acts 17:30), therefore, everyone will have a new heart. (Ezekiel 36:26-27)  For it pleased the Father that in him should all fulness dwell; And, having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things unto himself; by him, I say, whether they be things in earth, or things in heaven. Colossians 1:19-20 - All things mean all things!!!  One God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all. Ephesians 4:6  Now the Lord is that Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty. But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord. 2 Corinthians 3:17-18  We are being made in the image of Jesus! ❤Who (Jesus) shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body, according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue ALL things unto himself. (Philippians 3:21) Thus all shall fulfill the first and great commandment!  Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out. And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me. This he said, signifying what death he should die. John 12:31-33   Jesus not only took the place of Barabbas physically but spiritually as well. When Jesus said "Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do"; who do we suppose the "them" is? All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned everyone to his own way; and the LORD hath laid on him the iniquity of us all. Who hath believed our report? and to whom is the arm of the LORD revealed? (Isaiah 53:1;3)   And he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for ours only, but also for the sins of the whole world. 1 John 2:2 Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins. 1 John 4:10 God mourned for all so that he may redeem all because God who is Love, never fails (1 Corinthians 13:7-8).  Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things. Philippians 4:8  Jesus saves all. Although, harlots and tax collectors will go into the Kingdom of God before Pharisees, thus, the last shall be first, and the first last! Lesson of truth: We are not being made in the image of a Pharisee.
And then say nana nana boo boo.
She did not say what the condition's are because Putin has said it before. Put down your weapons and line up for the firing squad.
Putin was so demanding for the sake of their own benefits
Wasted time….
Daga daga
Vlad the impossible dictator
he is lying
Maybe Ukraine need to bring a fight to Moscow
why i whitre hosue and america censored while russia living democratic free speech world
So what the eff are their demands. You don’t say that
Putin has already lied several times regarding Ukraine. There is no incentive to believe him this time
aren't those demands reasonable?
Someone in russia has to deal with this situation
Demanding leader!
This report said absolutely nothing.
The rusdisn civivilian havr oeopke tovdemote their pres putin is a hitler and not contented of his country.
if you don't have strength to fight then it's better to get one step back and wait for right moment msg for Ukraine ....
So.....if Ukraine surrenders, Russia will stop the war! That doesn’t sound like progress.
Start bombing Russia cities back . Watch Russia turn on Putin immediately after that . Solution for Ukraine.  Tit for tat.
so what are the demands?!?!
Russia will Stop fighting until Russias demands are met? Sounds like an oxymoron. Nothing stops now. The scars are too deep. We should take the opportunity to destroy Russia, and to oust The domestic terrorist who sits in the Oval Office along with his socialist morons.
At this point I think Europe would win war with Russia. Send there our troops to kick Putins ass!
Poutine will end the war if everyone capitulates and declare him the winner .  ( Mis-spell was intentional )
" worst refugee crisis since the second world war" wht fkn bullcrap,..what about syrian,iraqi,.yemeni,afghani refugees that have been flooding into the EU since US and Nato Indiscriminate Bombing in Iraq...??? wtf,....
I have said it...since the start...PUTIN is CORRECT. He is also a good leader, sensible and courageous, and a smart  mastermind strategist. He did  not want  Ukraine people to die...but he will not compromise Russias security under any circumstances. I have said it at the start Putin is not the creator of this scenario. The world should be very careful about Putins words...These are not words of an idle mind...He WILL do just as he says .  And there should be no doubt in anyone's mind....Russia has the power to take down Nato and EU combined..along with whoever threateningly stands in its way.  Ukraine should hastily surrender and stay alive....Ukraine cannot pretend to be innocent of the past happenings that have threatened Russia.   It is sad..some countries (as bystanders) keep giving weapons to Ukraine ...thereby fuelling the fire with false hopes to weaken Russia .....while also knowing well that Ukrainians will die inevitably.  I hope Ukraine gets sensible and there is peace.
So if you stop fighting back and let us execute your citizens in their own homes, then we'll end our war.  Yeah...
Read the history. One reason Russia is in Ukraine is because they are fighting Nazis amongst a hidden enemy
I was waiting for what's the demand  of rasPutin,but it wasn't mentioned.ugh
Putin knows hes causing hardship for the Russian  people!!!! But to say one of the things The ukraine must do..to prevent further conflict is to stop fighting...lmao  wassent it putin who started this war ??  lmao
sometimes pride will kill you..
little vlad is getting beaten on all fronts especially with world wide sanctions against russia , and the little prick still thinks he is calling the shots , what an ego
What demands are those? That they not be allowed to be an independent nation? And no NATO integration? What a stupid and obtuse thug Putin is...👎🖕
click bait piece of crap
Maybe we will get lucky and Vlad will Nuke D.C. before this is over with...
The saddest part is people are forming  opinions like they have a master degree in political science yet just a few months ago they couldn't even find Ukraine on the map.
PUTIN >NUMBER TOW HITLER >PUTINIAN EMPIRE >TELL THE GENERAL DIET 😈💀☠💀💀👿
THANK YOU 🐬 DIVINE ♍
Turkey needs to be very careful. Putin wants to control Black Sea, and to stop this, Turkey needs to ban all Russian ships entering through Turkey water. If this is not stopped, Russia will start invading Turkey as they want to control Black Sea.
Putin wants to control the Ukrainian people and that's not going to happen.  Your demands are laughable and far reaching. What has happened here is that Putin has allowed the entire world to see him for who he really is.
Oh my God kill the background music it's really hard to hear what she is saying
Whichever side boasts about their achievements and how badly their opponents are doing in a time of war, is probably lying, and as such, proving to everyone they are clearly in the wrong and are losing the war.
Putin's demands? The world should kick Russia's ass out of Ukraine. Then all that Russian money frozen in foreign banks, seized, oligarchs houses ,yachts goes to Ukraine for war reoperations. The Russian people need to cancel that president for life for Putin. Putin's  leadership have led then down a foolish path.
Does Putin plan on fighting the whole world because clearly NO one wants World War III ?  NO one wins! … USA will defend its self because we have NO choice!  🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Erdogan: dont let Putin down or Turkey will be flattened like a pancake (that is what prophecies of German seer Irlmaier say)
He’s getting his ass handed to him on a plate. He’s a barking old dog.
Puttin should somehow be prosecuted for all he has done
What are Moscow demands
Dumb newscasts...
So Ukraine  mist stop defending and Moscow will stop afterwards....
Provide Ukrainians with air power and right arsenals to match the Russians..that way a counter balance of voice might be heard and not just the demands of the Putin regime..send nato's special forces to the grounds, surely they can easily blend in with the 16000 foreigner fighters..
Since he did not honor any cease fire agreements they need to follow old scotish saying "fool me once shame on you fool me twice shame on me.  Fool me thrice its a shamble."  No deal.
Special Economic Conditions 🤗
Putin has already lost this war. He is the one who should surrender
What are moscow's demands?End the bloodshed!
Putin will not stop until he receives a large dose of humility, or a Bullet ! It's his choice ! You cannot reason with a Mad man ! Fellow Russians realize this, and are rising up ! Sooner or later, the Russian people will stop living in fear, and rise up !
Translation: “All you have to do to stop the war is surrender, and do everything we tell you. Perfectly reasonable!” 🤦🏻‍♂️
Useless with negotiation with Putin
Putten can not be trusted.
i have heard the united states will exchange the COMMUNIST putin BELARUS tractors with new John Deere???
Ukraine should accept peaceful agreement ,end this violence
When are we going to impose sanctions on all western nations that perpetually come against Africa, Africans and all of us of the diaspora?  And when will ALL non-black people leave Africa?
How about he met the conditions of the free world and packed his shit and went to jail? Support to Ukraine✌✌✌✊✊!!!
The whole world is like a bunch of snowflakes with their I phones out filming an old woman being beaten by a gang of thugs, rather than risking a punch, or worse, if they step in to stop the beating.  He will not nuke because he knows he will die.
But NATO is ok with Turkey, Israel, and the US  invading Syria. What a hypocritical world.
Putin is deluded ! He needs to remove his tanks and weapons fto Ukraine and then pay to rebuild the cities in  Ukraine he has destroyed . There is absolutely no excuse for killing anyone !  What an absolute disgraceful murderer  Putin is ..
How the Hell it's possible to smile under this conditions?  you people of Russia need to take out this idiot,which doesn't have respect for nothing and none!
We want India Pakistan and china 5o be united as turkey and Russia.
I think if it goes on you will see car bombs in Moscow .
Well? What are the conditions? Get rid of all Neo Nazis battalions, close down destroy the US controlled biolabs. Why is that hard to say?
Putin lies. Not to be trusted.
Thats what happened.Crimea was lost.The EU & NATO must not fall in his trap as he also demands that NATO withdraws it forces.He has intentions to invade the Non-Nato countries.
Pretty sure everyone knows from his past that Ukraine had better not stop fighting. Russia will lose this in the end.  The people of Russia will are paying the price for putins invasion as well.  Ukraine nor the population of Russia had a choice in this.  Putin and his military leadership should be held accountable, wether they are or not we will see.
TO HELL WITH RUSSIA'S DEMANDS.... PUTIN IS A WAR CRIMINAL, PERIOD.
Why should Ukraine stop fighting?
Seems putin is reaching out to any and all those who he thinks may stand with him. Or putin can't trust anyone because of the corner he has painted himself in.what ever I don't know. But his condition wanting Ukraine 🇺🇦 people to lay down their weapons will not stand. The world 🌎 stands with Ukraine 🇺🇦 people.
Donde están los militares rusos que no le dan  un golpe de estado al asesino este de Putin .para que se pare está infame guerra
HOW DRAMA THEY'VE  MADE  THAT  MORE PEOPLES LIVES LOST ANF MILLIONS GET AWAY FROM RUSSIA
Can't deal with terrorist, the World needs to treat Putin like Bin Laden.   There isn't a reason not to.  Get the Air Force to take care of business, otherwise, it's a waste of time.
So he'll stop killing innocent people and kids when they stop trying to defend themselves... This terrorist must be put down.
Ukraine shuld bomb russia too, in the heart of russia, the capital, the armory while sanctions is still the there
Basically,  Russia wants Ukraine to be totally cut off from the world, listen to solely them, give up everything to defend themselves,  control who Ukraine does business with (only deal with who Russia approved of), and Basically only to pretend to be Ukraine but really be under Russian government authority!! And then after all that in a couple years once they make it easier for themselves they just go in and say Ukraine broke a promise and now just totally invade and do what they wanted to from the get go!
Total bollox
Congratulations  Putin, your the new Adolf Hitler
It is high time the ICC acts, Putin's behavior and genocidal actions are unacceptable, nor must he get away with it. It is obvious he has lost all his abilities to a normal standard. The terrible miscalculation he did will make Putin a war criminal and must be charged as a result. Even the Russians live in danger. This is a sick dictator leaving a massive string of dead people destroyed a free independent country in the aftermath of his lethal ruling, Putin must be no longer be tolerated in our world, period, Pepsee
The truth is NATO should have been scrapped after the end of the cold war.
Many people are losing their lives .War is not the solution. The only thing war does is ,to destroy lives and cities built with so many years. Very sad innocent people minding their business have to be caught in wars and lose their lives.This war has made Russia very unpopular now. No body thought Russia can do this.
Why are You repeating the same sentence again again 😁 Indian media won’t change 🤣
There will be no set conditions to end the invasion, it's too late for that now, there will only be an end to commun!st Russia and RusPutin
So wtf R U saying????  Putting will stop the war if Ukraine surrenders?
Am I missing something? What are the conditions?
He is getting scared now ..hecknowsvthe mistake he has made and people hate him for it .
He's only willing to negotiate because he's losing the war. I know its sad but Ukraine needs to finish what Putin has started and end him for good. Good luck 👍 💓 ✨️
1 million Ukrainian refugees in Poland. Stop this madness. Let people go home.
become russian puppetstate and we will stop the war......
Not sure either side could trust Turkey...the government, not the people.
I salute the people of Ukraine may God bless & protect you in this difficult time & may you surprise all & win this war that's been bought to your country! Long live Ukraine! Sending all of you love support & prayers! ♥🙏 🇺🇦
Let's go Putin..
If Russia does ceasefire and goes home...who's going to pay for the damage? Look at what mother Russia has done.. they've made many orphans, widows,widowers , physiological damage let alone the infrastructure cost of his war...
Well that's a typical government answer no damn answer at all
"Stop defending yourselves so we can take over your country, you are making it difficult for us to conquer you".
Same demands.. simple ..not to join evil NATO that could endanger Russia's security
It's just saying surrender your arms, rights, liberty, freedom, sovereignty and territory.
Click bait.....
Help me out here.  If I understand correctly, if Russia is given everything it demands of Ukraine, it will stop killing the Ukrainian people and destroying Ukrainian cities.  Has anything changed in Russia's position?
Putins going after the UN Biowarfare labs...
Was Putin trying to fist bump?
Go Ukraine! The Native Americans in the United States support Ukraine. We stand behind you all. God bless you all.. 🙏
Wealthy facists killing children over their money god
Slavery ,fallen world Jesus Christ care for you paradise eternity be prepared his return is near😋🍷
A looser doesn't has the right to set any conditions for anything  You are getting your ass weeped Putin on so many fronts You did  trow your own country, your own people in a cave Mr. Putin Killing civilians, leveling peaceful city's and villages in a democratic country may be your vision of reality Sadistic, mentally deficient, old, archaic KGB realic of the past Go to hell, finally you may be liked there Putin must go!!
We will listen to Russia when Russia abandoned Ukraine.
Ukraine is just a bait as U.S. is laughing at them now. After the MIDDLE EAST been devastated and now they are moving to EUROPE.
No surrender! Keep killing those who wish to suppress and oppress you!
Ukraine not a member of NATO should arm themseves with thousends of ATM's and AAM's in defensible positions around their cities to protect themselves. It will cost a century to restore confidence in their neighbour again.  Putin breeded more ukrainian nationalists in three weeks then 30 years of independence did.  Putin won but russia lost ; congratulations.
I will say one thing today the war is because of USA and nato they are the only reason why today Ukraine is in this condition and u guys are blaming Russia  Just think for a will If Ukraine joins nato USA will send it's army and attack Russia and with this all the member countries in nato will attack Russia  This is the master mind of USA and nato one thing I will say to Ukraine neighbors are more important than friend  They are the one who will help at time
Take all the amo blow every thing to peaces tell him to stick it you is aaasssss
What were the demands? The same as usual? Give me everything you own without a fight while I kill all your people?
Satanic war
Once a bully always a bully, Putin will never change.  I wouldn’t trust him as far as I can spit
The public tide is turning. He’s trying to find ways to save face. Unite further, world !!
So what are his conditions?? Can anybody tell me?
Empty report! You did not mention WHAT those demands are! You call this reporting?
Ughhh what a news! Where's our lockdown heroine mannn, palki come and speak please
No body can stop occupying ruling others  it's all feels happened atpresnt timbing of rules
Putin fasist
The Sanctions against Putin's Russia, are effectively PERMANENT.  Western countries will continue to reduce exposure, business and oil purchases from Putin's Russia. Russia will be economically isolated within 5 years .. turned to junk.
One of the demands is not telling what are the demands..
Let me guess, Putin demands are that full NATO members like Poland will be ousted from NATO, that the Ukraine shall have no army, and that he should install a puppet government there.. Well, these demands will only make the Ukrainians fight to the death, and the entire western world - find ways to aid them in their plight. If Putin does not accept the fact that the Ukraine is an independent state, the Ukrainians will just have to prove it to him, with their blood - and with plenty of western weapons.
Putin has no interest in negotiations, he is going to kill the innocent, blow up nuclear plants and eventually invade other countries, he is only interested in a war with the USA everything else is just to antagonise the USA, sorry Ukraine your just pawns in his game with the US
Putin's demands are legitimate..I just wonder if Mexico wants to join Russia and wants Russian nukes on its soil...what will be American reaction
So what's the deman? Get to the point instead of repeating the same words for whole video
So there we have it. It was without doubt an invasion, Putin will murder and murder until he gets what he wants. Where are NATO, the EU and the UN. Demands have been made, where are the peace keeping forces? Or are you going to let Putin dictate to the Ukraine and the rest of the world. This blackmailing monster needs to be dealt with now.
Don’t hate the gamer, hate the game.. do you really think Putin alone is causing this mess?  If the world leaders REALLY wanted to stop him, they would have, in one day. They’re just dragging it around. Oh yeah, what happened to covid btw?
PUTIN KNOWS THAT U.S. IS INVADING SILENTLY AS THEY URGE MOST COUNTRY FROM ASIA TO EUROPE TO BE THEIR ALLIES AGAINST RUSSIA AND CHINA THATS WHY PUTIN DONT WANT UKRAINE TO BE ON NATO BECAUSE IT IS SO NEAR TO THEIR BOUNDARY.
Turkish president is another dictator like Putin he has killed so many innocent civilians Kurds in Turkey +Syria + Iraq and he created ISIS and trained them in Turkey
'ONE MILLION, BAZILLION, DOLLARS'  *strokes white cat*
Putin has no intention to end the war before he is on his knees, just as he had no intention to go to war 2 weeks ago. A liar through and through.
Wtf are the demands. 🙄
yes that is what needs to be done to menny kids have dies theres 4 years old kids runing round on there own painfull just end it
This guy is a psychopath,he can't be trusted
Russians should park their army convoy columns near major nuclear plants, that way enemy can't mount an attack
you left out the important part.. the conditions
All his demands are fully justified to keep NATO in check for it's careless arbitrary expansions towards east over past decades hasn't stopped. NATO failed to keep up with the promise they made during the agreement of 'Treaty of final settlement with respect to Germany' and has crossed the line. Russia had enough and now it's fighting back.  Go Russia!! 🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺
Good news I hope  The conditions are good for Ukraine and Russia.
Dictator putin wants you to stop so he can take control of everything, including your country,, its all bull 💩💩💩💩💩💩,
Basically mean Russia trust turkey more than India,
What are russias demands!?!?!?!?!?
This man is in NO posutuon to make ANY demands.
He wants the world leaders to notice him
We know that’ll never happen
The  conditions are simple  get out of Ukraine pay reparations  and send war criminals to the Hague  that includes  Crimea  .   The War Criminal is not in a position of making demands
Turkey is in Putlers sights.. this is the same as Hitler making false friend with Stalin. Putin has plans to take Turkey and join Russia to Syria
This is a stupid report by WION. What are the demands? Without that this news was useless
Supported with weapons and money from the USA and NATO, the Ukrainian army did and was doing worse things against the civilians of Donetsk and nobody said anything.     That's how hypocritical the Newscasts of the USA and the West are.
U invade a country Set a CONDITION and Demand Your Condition to be accepted as precondition to stop ur invasion! Good example for world peace! Lol. World should unite and Give Putin a lesson for his BS!
Don't attack innocent non combatants.  Be a man Putin!   Offer yourself up for a DUEL.  Atleast be man enough to get on the frontline and lead your troops in person.  Oh! I almost forgot about your cowardice.
PEOPLE OF UKRAINE DIDNT DESERVED THIS! YOU ARE A MONSTER PUTIN YOU KILL A LOT OF PEOPLE AND CHILDREN.
This guy is not serious about what is happening
Putin is a losser
Get to point.
He is worried about war crimes. Sanctions working.
I wish Putin would have asked him to pull his troops out of Cyprus.
He will leave Ukrane alone
Stop this animal, period.
What fucking conditions
Ottawa Canada and Putin new Soviet Russia - same Oppressive Stasi, same state run Media
Give me all the drugs in the world an Il go lock my self in a bunker goodbye world
The Ukrainians will fight for their independence..Bravo to the people of Ukraine..We will pray you all be safe, strong and God will protect you and your country..Amen🙏🙏🙏
Putin. Where is Oswald when we really need him.
"Stop fighting us, Ukraine, so we can continue to massacre you unimpeded!"
RUSSIA = WALKING DEAD! IGNORE PUTLER, IGNORE RASHIA, ONLY FULL CAPITULATION OF RUSSIA IS ACCEPTABLE!
FALSE NEWS...PUTIN WILL EVER SAY THAT AND BOW DOWN TO WESTERN WORLD
No one knows the demands but at least something is on the table. If it is not to join Nato....seems a small thing if all one really cares about is saving civilians. Which is sang by the west out of every loudspeaker. My guess is there is more to it behind the scenes.
The reporter said, "... if Ukrains stop fighting..." LIES!!! Ukrain is DEFENDING itself from Putin's military attacks and destruction against Ukrain and people!! Putin's war even attacked the area of a nuclear power plant! UKRAIN IS DEFENDING ITSELF!
What are the demands?
Putin is doomed as a hit man with many blood in his hands... The future generation will never forget.
So what the hell are those demands? Might have been helpful to have stated them!!
1:15 lol did Putin try a fistbump?
Putin Ukraine is not your country, you get out of Ukraine you have no rights to be there, that is bullying, you will never win against the nato and the UN.
They never are sent
Putin does not like to repeat his demands because he knows how ridiculous they sound. They are completely unreasonable and controlling.
I request all of you plz play your rule to stop war in ukrane otherwise it would be third world war
I support Russia 🇷🇺
Here is what is acceptable to Ukraine = Moscow removes all troops and military equipment from Ukraine, and Ukraine will stop destroying Russian troops and equipment. Nothing else will be agreed to.  If Russia does not agree to this, then the war will continue until there is nothing left of the Russian military, it will be destroyed by Ukrainian troops with the help of supplied Western military equipment .
Biden will now act like a hero
That will give Putin enough time to send everyone to the gulags like Stalin
Putin must pay all damages in Ukraine including infrastructures.
I still believe the Antichrist will come out of Turkey…

Putin simply wants attention
good good very good boss
Russia has never cared  about the 'Butcher's Bill' for any conflict. Not since the Charge of the light Brigade and more recently other battles that she has engineered. It is an unpredictable future for us all for the days to come.
Russia just want Elvis that's hiding in Ukauranus ..
To hell with Putler!
Puta will turn off the lights by shutting down the nuclear power plant; he might even deliberately set the plant to melt down!
what are the demands????
HIS CONDITION IS HE'S GONNA STEP DOWN
Putin is a pathological liar  UN leadership must kick Putin's government off UN security council
Not surrendering military or arms or government but they might aswell agree not join nato we see how helpful they have been already risk too high
What are the conditions
Worse report ever.  Total waste of my time.  You click baited me and told me precisely nothing!
Putin ends invasion, but starts it again 30 minutes later after feeling slighted that Ukrainian civilians still exist.
What are moscows demands. What a useless channel
Wonder if ukraine is gonna stop fighting
Ukrainr has the right to fight for their rights ans freedom. To hell with this Putin and his cohorts. They will all go to hell
Useless, only telling that the demand is that all of Moscow's demands should be met is not newsworthy
Civilians want to get out of Mariopol. A seacefire was promised, but it was not honored by the Russians. In this way there is no more choise given to the Ukraine people; die in battle or die during evacuation. Guess what they will choose....  Russian is nog in a war that cannot be won and then will completely bankrupt Russia. It will end up like Germany after WW2.
Global peace
Why did he make war first all the killings it's all on him  .. No one will leke him and Russia only he's cumminst country's will like him
in short "Do what I want and I stop killing innocents people".
After He bombard Ukraine, who he think he is. God is with Ukraine, Putin will go down soon
hes losing the war anyways
😵‍💫 The Vlad is demented - there's no reasoning with the demented 😵‍💫
Yea and Modi is a fascist toss-pot !
Putins days are numbered. If someone doesn't assassinate first, he will be jailed by his own people eventually to stand trial. You don't need to have  high IQ to work out his days in power are becoming less and less. Also by now I presume he has realised by the time taken in gathering ground in Ukraine that Russian forces are now being embarrassed by Ukraines military. Super power my arse... I am guessing next if he tries launching a nuke it will fail due to faulty electrics 🤣
Putin should ask countries that he helped in the past to give him a hand. Countries like Iran, Syria, Cuba ... Ukraine can get rid of these morons for the world in one shot.
If nato stops expansion also,Biden administration is in vengeance on putin
A news report which didn't report anything except a prior report
The UN and NATO  can do more  it's like  history  repeating itself  we allowed  bullies to have their say .Ukraine  must never give up its  Russia  that is feeling  the pain also.
As of late when you see  dignitaries from other countries meeting with Putin, Putin seems to be fully extending his arm to shake hands, while the dignitary seems to keep his arm far  less extended. Typically, I wouldn't have noticed this, but after watching a few of these,  I  find it so glaringly obvious, and difficult not to notice.  Body language is such an interesting science.
yooooo Did putin just try to fist bump!!?
Biden and Putin are partner in this be careful
NO NO NO DONT END WAR ,ITS VERY ENTERTAINING !!!
Save your self Pukin hell is coming for you heroes come forward and fight for God...
We coming for YOU!!!!!!!
What are Moscow's demands?
And those demands are....?
This does not say what demands are......just repeats same phrases and clips ie. HOPELESS/USELESS REPORTING!!!!!!!
Yeah right ?
What kind of information this.....?????
What a joke sumbody assasinate pootin
The demands are to surrender your country to Russia.  That is an absolutely unacceptable demands and if I were Ukraine I will fight to the last man for my freedom.  You can either live in chains, or die on your feet. People who have tasted true freedom would rather prefer the latter
Says the most corrupt evil hearted dictator and country .
India voted No to condemn Russia. Little bias here with all of the Indian comments
Demands are "Met"...  Just imagine if we "Met" Hitlers demands...  He simply needs to leave Ukraine...  There is nothing else to speak about.
Amazing news. Now I know the same as before this video. Give me back my wasted 2min.
Your video tediously repeats.  It makes me want to delete your channel.
Putin you have to pay for these Stroggly.
How about this instead, Ukraine bleeds Russian forces white while the special military operation drags on for another 4 weeks and the Russian economy goes into the toilet and Putin will reluctantly end the conflict on a different set of terms
n  n I have your test Covid test oh I got three of you already gave it OK to get Berger told me to put Santos @Caah Santos are free that if you already got it yeah I’m good back processor yes they better be safe than sorry song between Tubarão brilliant Deko
Putin demands'::stop making fun of my little peepee,,ok,sure pooty...
Mr. PUTIN WHO DO U THINK U ARE?YOU ARE IN NO POSITION TO DETERMINE HOW THE WORLD ROTATES.IF YOU COMMIT MORE WAR CRIMES YOU WOULD BE BOMB TO DOOM.LET NATO CHIEF REPEAT MY WORDS,MAY BE HE CANNOT WRITE AN APPROPRIATE SPEECH.
I wasted time with this clip. We know long time ago that Putin has demands. Don’t waste time with news articles like this
Thence ends another episode where   innocent people pay with their lives for the lunacies of stubborn dictators...
news editor sucks, but comments are interesting.
MY MESSAGE TO NATO is: Putin Invades Other Country Today, Putin Will Do It Again, and Again. MY MESSAGE TO PUTIN is: Nato Chicken Out Today, Nato Will Chicken Out Again and Again
He is full of shit don't believe this he wants them to stop fighting so he can kill them all
So one guy huh? Maybe these oligarchs wanna stay rich and alive? One guy? A state funeral is better than the end of the world.
Time for China to take out India
Vladimir: Give up and let me win! 🤣   Can't make this stuff up...
Yeah this was a pointless 2  min lol. No real info about anything. At least they didn't speculate what these "demands" might be. Like the comment section will be doing lol
🤞🏽” if Ukraine first stops fighting “ you mean if Ukraine stops defending themselves? Cause that’s all they’re doing is fight back vs invaders
Feel sorry for Russian people , one man speaking for all of them , I thought communism. Was same for all people , why are there elite rich , why does one man start a war.  The people need someone speaking for them.
"People talking without speaking"...
Can’t blame the Russians for this war. He warned NATO and Ukraine not to get too cozy and threaten his western border.
Did I miss something...? What demands?
The world conditions for Russia to not be an international pariah are Putin must be removed, the method of which way is their discretion.
You only set condition if you are winning a war. When you have been rudely stopped in place you are in a stalemate and have nothing to demand.
Wuuuu putin drug addict
Remember Putin is untrustworthy on every level. No sense, no reason and no logic. Manipulative, lying and power hungry on all accounts.  "Setting conditions" means nothing.  You can't reason with a psychopathic Narcissist.  It is his will wherever it takes him at any cost for power and attention.
NATO AND THEIR GLOBOLIST MASTERS ARE THE PROBLEM  AND RUSSIA  WILL FREE  THE WORLD  LONG LIVE RUSSIA AND MR PUTIN 🇷🇺☦☪️☝️
Madman Putin
have rarely seen such shit reporting 😂
Putin is speaking into a vacuous void. His words are sounding muted & hollow, nobody is listening to him. He is finished, & needs psychological help if he is to retain any degree of respect or trust from the Russian people as a whole.  Russia as a country is NOT looked down on by the rest of the world in general.  It's their leadership which refuses to acknowledge that Russia could become a leader & participant in a colossally productive & unified world. Dear Mr Putin, you have a momentous opportunity right now to unite countries of the world instead of dividing them.  Everyone appreciates loves & sovereignty, so please put the sovereignty of The Ukraine at the top of your priorities so that Eurasia can become a world powerhouse of cooperation and a fine example to the rest of the World's countries.
I love you Russia
France has modern day colonies. UK invaded Falkland islands and colonized many counties,  US bombed Japan, Syria ,Libya etc. But blame Russia for trying to defend their borders. Fu*k western media. Putin is right to demand that Nato should not expand. Look at what they did to Libya and Gaddafi.  They are after Russia and its oil reserves.
PUTIN IS A TERORIST
So he is saying we will kill everyone unless they turn the country over to him. So let's say he wants India and he attacks India and says give me your country or I will kill everyone.
He is not in a position anymore to put any conditions; now, things have changed and he, Putin; is in disadvantage.
Whatever happens Russia and its people are finished for the next 30 years. Pyriah state
So what are those conditions? 2 minutes of my life wasted on this stupid so-called "news."
y'all got click baited
Please world peace
What about the demise and infrastructure that were gone cam You reinstall them again fo it again.
Putin have attack neighboring countries on the pretext that he is defending Russian speaking people, the world turns a blind eye, this will be the last war he will ever create, the suffering of innocent people thanks to one man's greed is out of hand.
Doesn't matter what he does,,he's a marked man.
What a stupid video. Just to get views. Video should be deleted
Ukraine from the beginning ready to stop fighting if no longer attacked. Ceasefire fully depends on Putin's will.   Now what does this murderer, rapist, robber want from the ukraine people and outside world other then 'respect' ?  What values are worth this crisis ?  whole world may expect an explanation.
she sexy,..
Atleat you should cover  what  they demand 🇮🇳💖🇺🇦
If I can't have you, noone can....
What are those conditions ,
Poke the Bear .. Deal with the Bear...
Yeah , that's what narcissist dictator would say.
What are those demands you??
I can tell you what Putin's conditions are: 1. Ukraine not join the European union.  2. Ukraine not join NATO. 3. Ukraine have a puppet government under Russian  All are impossible now that the people of Ukraine have had a taste of democracy. Russia will not be able to hold Ukraine if that puppet government is established unless he arrests the "dissidents" and jail them like Navalny.  That is not going to be easy.
still cant believe Turkey is part of NATO knowing they behind the bombing of Palestine and so much more dissapointed thought Erdogan wanted piece in those places as well but never fought for them like this!
To hell with Putin!
He doesn’t get to call any conditions. What he has done so far has already sealed his own fate. He’s a criminal to his own people and to the world. His fate will be identical to Hitler’s.
If you watched the news last 2 weeks the demands were for Ukraine NOT to join NATO. Ukraine was given opportunity to join NATO in 2021, Russia took this as a threat because Ukraine will be able to hold nuclear weapons RIGHT NEXT to Russian soil. But what do I know, im only doing more research than a YouTube comment section 🤔
If we can learn any lessons from this war it would have to be... 1. Never trust politicians to keep their words. 2. Current  Russian government is not trustworthy. 3. Western governments are fickle. 4. Never trust a foreign government to take on another nation. 5. If you are not a member of a club, they shall sit on the sidelines and watch you get beat. It is not their fight, but you shall get a hell lot of verbal encouragement. 6. Know your true friends.
What fucking demands? Congratulations on the emptiest 2 minutes in YouTube history. A test pattern would have been better.
Give Putin the people on Bidens hit list.
Does any one think like me out dear that USA caused this behind doors
This comment section is a bunch of dummies.
A price is put on putins head.
useless video
WHAT ARE THE DAMN DEMANDS
ukraine will be putins grave
Shaking my head.
Just double down until your out of troups? Delivering  ultimatums after the losses his army sustained is surely just BRAVERY OF BEING OUT OF RANGE? The country is protesting because now Russians have to wear Kevlar bodysuits? The munitions used to accidentally target residential building is the same used to retreat?
Joke?
hey...where were you all when the Palestinian people and their country were destroyed?.. bullshit about world peace organization
Putin doesn’t make any sense!! He should pull off his troops from Ukraine first. As long as his troops are in Ukraine, Ukraine has no choice but fight back.
Putin is playing with people again
I don't think that Ukraine should put their arms down first. What's the Point? Putin has to pull out first to stop the war that he created.
Time to tell Putin we’re coming for you. Anyone defending him will be in prisoned. Offer immunity for those that help in his capture. And large award.
From terrorist to hostage taker asking demand.
Left media and politicians are servants of "defense" corporations or shall we call them "offense" corporations. In any case they are pushing for a war to be permanent in the region. While Russia invasion is inappropriate, Ukraine hasn't been precisely an angel with the Ukrainian-Russians and the far right nazy movement has gained force in Ukraine to levels never seen before which makes things quite messy
Why are people not understanding what Putin is saying? What if russia puts a base in Mexico how will America gvt react?
Funny News !
Indian government should be sending airplane to racist Poland and pick up all student stranded at border.  They been there freezing  their ass for 3, 4,5 days.
Mr Putin just back off
So his demands are met meaning do what he says or else. The wotld needs to stand against his evil and he needs to stop killing .
biden: putin no idea what is coming. lmao 😂
"Our top story: Gigantic Earth destroying Earthquake set to hit somewhere, sometime, eventually, with billions of dead and total destruction maybe not but probably....eventually...yes...or not."

Roll on World War 2022
Don't create a LARGER THAN LIFE picture of Erdogan. Putin will do it his way.
Everyone, you are all people, and you all deserve your opinion, but, all we can really do rn is hope for the best, let God do the rest 🙏, Imo I feel like Ukraine should surrender, I know it's Brutal but if anything zelensky should be evacuating his people not gearing  up to die
Dont believe anything russians say,they have broken every promise.
Funny, Turkey that is illegally occurring 38% of sovereign territory of Cyprus without any consequences is mediator 🙄🙄🙄
🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦
I love people like Putin💪💪 this man don't play go go Putin show them who really you are if the world had 5 people like Putin we would live peaceful. much respect Putin!!!!
American racketeers will see to it that this conflict lasts a REAL long time  $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
You are already defeated, you can't put demands on Ukraine. US and Poland "working actively" on a deal to supply Ukraine with fighter jets.
Not far away in near future Putin and his henchmen will meet their destiny.
The only reason he's even mentioning this now, is because it's turning out to be a disaster for Russia.. give him or Russia nothing, and squeeze Russia until it collapses.. LOVE TO UKRAINE ...♥️
Bet they're not acceptable
Side report: That reporter looking like a snack OMG
The west lies they are the ones who caused it
Well what are the conditions???
My thoughts were  true wants that illegal annexation of Crimea in Ukraine e even before this Invasion That the reason why Putin invade  again Ukraine by force is he wants the international recognition of Crimea which is unacceptable.. Russia Putin must be stop now He is the most dangerous madman Iwe ever know  never trust him.  He deserves the harshest sanctions to deter him from aggression and horrific crimes against humanity.. He must be punished hard.
So mr Putin wants Ukraine to surrender...well then, why don't we just gift wrap Ukraine and hand it over to him...with a smile please!
Just a ploy to make him sound reasonable.
What are the conditions
What are Moscow's demands? There should be transparency. Let the people decide their future
b*****odo moscow ki demands to daal daytay video may
News: Putin tells Ukraine to strop struggling while he strangles them.
If Ukraine stops fighting Haha funny for starters he started this war it's Putin who should stop fighting and Retreat his troops from Ukraine
I hope a coup d’état happen within Putin inner circle, and bring him to court in front of Ukrainians, Russians, NATO, US and the world.
Putin is a dictator he should be in jail for a life
invasion
What a horrible news segment hahaha some amateur media shit right here
Umm ... so why not spell out those Russian conditions while your " reporting " ! !  3rd rate " journalism " ! !
NUTS!!!
Basically Russia will stop rapping if Ukraine stops resisting the rape and allow Russia to put in just the tip.
How are they supposed to stop fighting if Russia keeps attacking
Sorry it’s not going to happen, Ukraine will not give what Putin wants.  They started to invade Ukraine because they want to control it (Communist mindset).  Ukraine wants to grow their economy and be their own country.
Spare me this irrational nonsense about Jews for Jesus.  All gods are fictitious, Jesus, Yahweh, makes no difference.
From the start of this conflict I have said If the war rolled in to the west I don't trust the Turkish government in the that war
Seems like it’ll work out. Thank god Turkey’s president is easier to deal with than Ukraine’s president and actually seems like he cares.
I was going to grab how this clip does not say anything about what those particular demands are, but it seems that everyone else is thinking the exact same thing. Come on now, don't clickbait us.
No fly zone now please 🙏 😢 😭 😞
Lol those are his conditions? For Ukraine to give up ? Well done WION you just got millions of views in return for absolutely nothing
You said the same thing over and over for the whole dam video without saying what it was just ueless
So basically full surrender. From what I see the Soviet Union is losing. More troops more tanks, more planes. Russian troops are starting to mutiny as the Soviet’s cannot even feed them
The way WION reports things you are always left wondering what are the terms Putin demands. All I can say is he made it pretty plain. But you only get cut up snippets from WION. They try to slant the news  on just about every broadcast they make...Either there editor is just plain stupid or they think WE are. Just the facts Mam! Nothing but the Facts,
Nothing is as dangerous as allowing the same person to remain in power for a long time. The people get used to obeying him and he to commanding them, from which usurpation and tyranny originate.  Simon Bolivar.
But what are Putin's demands???
wtf news and wtf putin ?
mmmmkay......what are those demands?
Everything from Indian news outlets is just an extension of Putin's threats. India is a Russian asset.
Putin is a complete Fraud and a loser. Nato will be on his border anyway when Finland and Sweden join.
America can only condemn other countries but it should look at itself first at all the war crimes and crimes against humanity
You can't put conditions on ending the conflict little man  you have already lost the conflict and the  sanctions are going to break you little man.
In short words, there are no negotiations. It's Putin's way or the highway. Ukraine will never give up their independence/democracy. The Ukrainians are fighters and Putin can go fly a kite.
would be helpful info if you added what those conditions are.  felt like you just repeated your self over and for for 2 minutes
WHAT ARE THE DEMANDS?
He wants the Ukrainians to stop fighting so he can easily win the war.
Do it!!!!
What are the demands?
No worries the US will do everything possible to keep it going as long as needed
You said about 9 times "and Moscow's demands are met."  Seems like it would have been good to list those.
Hindus rule. Nice news.
First i thought that my video has bug, the lady is repeating herself. Oh wait 😀😀
base on her report Putin's demand is pretty vague and she explained 2 times.
Erdogan is playing both sides.  Turkey is a NATO member, but he is in conflict with NATO members all the time, and seeks help from Russia.
What is Moscow ‘s demand?
I'd rather die than give up to that c*nt
Hes Not Stopping No Matter what he says       he will Roll over Moldova if not stopped Now
Well, that was useless.
Horsedick news... the war is continuing...
I don’t believe anything that comes out of put-in mouth. He has said many times that he had no intention to invade 🇺🇦
"Stop fighting"!!!!!   How! And Why!!!! When Russia is invading and attacking a sovereign country? Putin is as crazy as NATO.
Still waiting for what "Moscow's demands" are exactly.
he is clear slave or death to Ukraine ,West knows that-and what?
Mad Putin. If there is anybody still sane in the Kremlin, they know what to do.
The Russians leave their equipment behind. The Turks, then the UN occupy the border between Russia and the Ukraine. Russia pays reparations. Putin has to resign. Lift the sanctions. Agree that the Ukraine does not join NATO.
What are the demands??? Reporter repeated herself like four times. It was like an echo???
The biggest refugee crisis since world war ii? How about when all the syrians were flooding into Europe because they were being bombed? Wasn't that more than 1.2 million?
Yea....  as soon as Ukraine stop fighting the invasion does stop...  and the occupation of Ukraine begins...
NATO hid behind Ukraine and provoked Russia, and WION should provide footage of NATO's destruction of Libya, Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan!
Hell yea you go Putin, let em know
The most ludicrous part of this is Erdogan playing the peacekeeper! Really? Erdogan? 2016, the Kurds, his own people….heck his forefathers have an illustrious record which would shame Putin and pretty much everyone else. What an insult!
What are the conditions ?????     Never stated any……..just a repeat loop on high lite wasted time viewing it….
KILL THE HOMICIDE MANIAC,,YOU SHOOT MAD DOGS AND THATS WHAT HE IS,,TOTALLY OUT OF CONTROL!!!
Russian bots working double overtime in the comments right now😂😂😂
Ukaraine to stop fighting first. Wow ! How about the one who first committed to the fight by advancing with excessive attack equipment and later saying those were for peacekeeping and Moscow withdraw the nuclear  launch attack as a first option of retaliation instead of a last line of defence, and explaining that such a threat was made under extreme pressure by a military Chief and president who was sick in the bowels. No offence but laying out the facts as they are.
Russia started it, so they need to make the first move.  Remove the planes, and turn the tanks around. THat is a sign that can be trusted. Putin cannot be trusted. And what are these other conditions?
We already know what he wants. Putin wants to put the former Ukrainian President back in control because he is Putins puppet. Then he can create Soviet Military Bases throughout the Ukrainian. He wants Soviets former glory over the world. He won't stop. NATO should have seen this coming. Putin put his Necular on high alert ad everyone backed off. He won't stop.
Заключить мир с Россией, не вставая на сторону Организации Североатлантического договора. Жизнь – это не просто шутка, это выбор. Спасибо за поддержку России.
Ukrainians are not going to agree to any sanctions, you are the aggressor   leave now.
History to daye has proved Putin words can not be trusted he only understands military force which NATO will eventially deliver.
To late for you putin potyong you already commit genocide heavy price is coming
Russian soldiers are in low morale and losing the battle inside Ukraine. Putin will end the war soon.
Putin at 0:38 trying to be cool as if he wasn't currently invading a neighboring sovereign nation
Why Rome is not speak up against the killing of women and children in Ukraine  ?
Good news. Hope this war comes to an end.
Puttin lied about the invasion and he’s lying about the conditions to end the war…If UKR beleived him and gave up these concessions they would be slaughtered just like the Jews in WW2
What a joke. Give up your freedom and join Russia China and trump.
Sentence replayed 5 times
Putin is so short!
We have some real idiots running a lot of Countries right now, it's getting pretty scary. It's time to stock up on the essentials.
What are zelensky's demands?
That is Good.. let us Not kill each other. We only have 1 life.. Let us love together !
pfff he lost this war the very moment he sent his troops in, and he lost it for the simple reason he had absolutely no idea the Ukrainians will fight him. Even if he somehow seized control of Ukraine's major cities, he does not have good enough logistics to keep his troops fed and he'd be fighting the population until he has to retreat. At this point I can only wish that somebody removes him from power because he's totally lost his marbles. There's no way he can gain anything anymore.
What are the demands?
I hear; ...only if Ukraine stops fighting. It should be, ...if Ukraine stops protecting itself.  That's when Russia will stop war....like WF??
I am waiting for Ottoman Empire in 2023 Capture 40 Countries
What’s Putin’s conditions?????????
Terrible reporting. What are the demands??
It is very symbol for Ukraine president to serve ppl's lives  by agreeing with Putin, if  Putin's demand need no blood, then why is he still fighting with him.he is making things worse.
Seems like Putin makes up his “demands” on the fly. Putin: So stop fighting and I will start coming up with my demands.
Putin is losing.
Only TLP Vote for TLP
wants are Moscow's demands ? You Never lay out their demands  are you clickbait?    please gives me both sides views . I want the news not propeganda or clickbait. So wants are Putin demands ?  Why are Western news agency like yours don't give both sides?
Putin needs to be tried as a war criminal, along with his cabinet members
Turkey is ready for Ottoman Empire in 2023  Real war start from 2023 Turkey+Russia+China+Iran+Pakistan+North Korea+Afghanistan+Palestian+Bangladesh v/s Rest of World
Putin still has to pay for war crimes
Special military operation, well that's some MLK ultra Shiz right there !
He attacks Ukraine without provocation, then demands that Ukraine stop fighting.
I wonder what would happen if Russia asked to join NATO ? Because Putins gripe with the West is legitimate. I remember when Ronald Reagan promised not to expand NATO.
The Russian Federation being the aggressor nation in this conflict is in NO POSITION to set any terms or "conditions." If I was President Vladimir Putin, I'd be more worried about the short and long-term aftermath of his misadventures.
Criminoso! Monstro!
Putin is like an iron rod and Binden is like a chow mein noodle.
Russia was provoked into this war. Western countries have lost their sense of infallibility. Russia is a nuclear power - Remember this! Nato can get nuclear missiles in its side if it continues to expand. Dozens of nuclear submarines patrol the ocean. No one dares to threaten Russia. Ukraine will get what it deserves. The blame is entirely on Washington for everything that will happen. With your sanctions, you will only make Russia stronger, fighting in parallel with its corrupt oligarchs. Thank you from the Russian people.
Enemy of humankind and war criminal Putin must die in jail for his crimes against humanity.
Conditions not good enough
Very informative. 2 minutes well spent 👍
Putin wants Ukraine to stop fighting, what about Russian forces to stop the invasion first. Hypocrisy and more Lies.
It’s boring watching Putin dictateing his terms to the west & N, A,T,O, with our so-called leaders doing nothing but waff ,
WION care about Ukrainians and Indian students in Ukraine But Not Palestinians, Iraqis, Afghans, etc.. who have gone through 10x worse than what is happening in the Ukraine.
Clean the corruption out Ukraine.
PEACE to Ukraine ...power to the Russian people....the entire problem is the responsibility of ONE MAN ONLY.
Putin’s time is limited!
Just when you think you can beat Putin, he uses the Kaioken x10.
Let me guess y'all believe him to
Russia is the one that is fighting...and it's Economy is about to fall into recession...putin knows that time is not on his side
Putin knows he is loosing since the world supports Ukraine. Do not give in to him, he needs to stop his war and repair damage to Ukraine!
Putin protect your country by all means these guys (NATO) invade 23 countries killing women and children. If you allow Ukraine to accommodate them you gonna lose your country and your people.  Protect your country from terrorists (NATO).
Good lord, Putin really doesn't think he's in ay kind of position to be setting conditions does he?  Because if so, Vladimir old chum, you need to understand that you will exit this debacle with much less than you entered. Russia will return Crimea and all other territory it has tried to take from Ukraine, and will pay heavy reparations, and frankly if you don't smarten up and get back into your proper place (which is keeping quiet and polite while the adults speak), you're going to lose more than that.   it would be entirely reasonable for Ukraine to demand that a couple hundred kilometres be added to the distance between every major Ukrainian city and the Russian Border. That's right Vlad, a possible consequence of your pathetic temper tantrum and lack of impulse control could be LOSING RUSSIAN SOIL.  And it should be. Understand something Vlad, your utter failure to maintain an erection at the beginning of your little 'adventure' has shown the rest of the world that Russia just isn't all that potent anymore.  Scandinavia is going to stop listening to you completely, Finland has been angry for decades but frankly, they're amused now, and you can expect 6-7 new members of Nato before the year is out.  And stomping your little feet will not help, this was all sealed up and waiting to crap all over Eastern Europe when you started diverting the Russian Economy away from Russia and into your own pockets. Your military is a joke, your people are now developing the anger of those learning how gullible and cowardly they were to allow a bully (you) to scare them. And before you start bragging about your Nukes.... Dude, if you didn't maintain your conventional forces which you KNEW you were gonna need frequently, don't try and tell me you spent billions out of your personal super yacht allowance keeping your launch vehicles, silos, and warheads maintained.  I'm sure you have a few dozen birds that will fly. I bet most of them are on subs. Subs that will have a lifetime measured on fractions of a second should any of the several Nato boats trailing every one of them hear a hatch start to open. You are screwed Vlad, you did it to yourself, and the only real sad part is how many people suffered, died, or had their opportunity and future squandered just because you're trash, with the morals of a rabid stoat, a sort of cunning of the kind that always manages to draw at tic tac toe, and a tiny wildly. Which everyone has now learned doesn't work very well.
It is not a special operation, it is a criminal war against a nation which wants to peacefully and free
Putin is not only ruining his economy but effecting the rest of the world’s. He’s in a defacto war with the world.
They never said what conditions the Russians demand.  Not much of a news story
Ukraine did nothing to Russia therefore we should give them all weapons they need .all Russia has to do is stop attacking Ukraine .they will not attack Russia .putin must be stopped at all cost all he wants is ukraines natural resoruses
What are Moscow’s demand WION?🧐🧐
If the war will end.. Putin needs to assess the capability of his armed forces. It is seem that they are only superior in number. Thats it.
BURRY “THE PIG” PUTIN (ASAP)!!
United Nations is a defunked club
What are the demands of Putin?
Ukraine will be turn into stone age if keep fighting. Use your brain Ukraine 🇺🇦. Don't be a pawn of western power. You can't move your country next to France. Russia is your neighbour and you can't change it. Don't be a trigger point of WW3. Russians will not compromise on its security.
Stop Putin's genocide.. "Satan is the father of lies and a murderer from the beginning.. (John 8:44)
As if Ukraine doesn't have demands only Russia. Sovereign Ukraine certainly wants join NATO/EU why not. What in the hell is wrong with Pussin? He is a laughing stock at world stage right now. Ukraine will prevail.
Yea old Putin has had enough of going broke and loosing but he gonna have to come off some of those demands!
Wellwhat are there demands you never did say wtf
Tell us more abt covid updates 🤣🤣🤣
You guys really think Putin will stop the war over some sanctions?  Putin is like a raging Bull  , highly doubt this will end. Although I really do hope.
This guy , just needs ignored
On 12/10/21 Putin issued an 8 point treaty: Read it and not the multiple remarks from the media.  Since that time Putin has added that Ukraine recognize Crimea as Russia territory and the independence of the two eastern provinces in Ukraine...on these two -- also do your research: Areas that Russia has for a couple of years pushed their military presence under a hypocritical disguise of parliamentary military controls and direct Russian intervention. So, now it's a 10 point treaty.  In addition, on 7/21/21 Putin disclosed to the world his 10 page article -- "On the Historical Unity of Russia"... which, is point blank Russian Imperialism...again do your research and read.  Not 16 days ago Putin also disclosed to the world a video he placed on the table again, confirming his 7/21/21 Article. And, for those who really want to know what's really going on...read the 1994 Budapest Agreement.  Again, another direct and willful violation by Putin. Such, actions are just more layers to place on the pile of reality.  And, the reality is Putin wants no opposition to his Emperor dreams as he kills people and destroys nations.  It has nothing to do about military on or near a border. November of 2021 there were not the 200k Russian troops along the Ukraine border; now 180k troops are in Ukraine: Intentionally, systematically and continually killing citizens.  And, how about the two agreed upon cease-fires that Russia broke; so that they could kill fleeing citizens
putin the little president want to destroyed the world
Let's recap; two people talked, they said words and they also had a conversation 😉
Nope, never loft the sanctions
Putin knows NATO will never regress it just solidifies his quest to conquer the Ukraine.  People are missing the big picture although this conflict may be part of the Ukraine becoming a NATO alliance, what many don't realize is that the Ukraine has huge reserves of natural gas and Putin wants it.
Who is fighting Putin or Ukraine? This man is a saddist
This invasion has similarities like the US illegal invasion of Iraq in 2003 which was not approved by the United Nations Security Council.   About 200,000 troops from US and her allies invaded Iraq. Till now, US and UK and her allies are not held accountable for the war crimes. How much oil was looted from Iraq till now? How many innocent women and children were killed? Did the hypocrite international communities condemn and sanction US and her allies back then?  And US, UK and her allies have the cheek to initiate world sanction against Russia for the similar illegal invasion of another sovereign country for whatever reasons.
Will Erdogan cease fire in Cyprus???  Why these leaders with skeletons in the closet act holier than thou?
And reason for that!!!!!!! Is because russia wants turkey to stop selling bayraktar drones that's why a talk to Turkey and not NATO not to mention the possible blockaid of the black sea by turkey as well
So what are the conditions
This comedian Jewish president of Ukraine should join Russia.
i am shadowbanned by youtube. No one can read this harmless message.

Lifting sanctions even if they end the war is pointless. Damage is done
Ukraine did not start this situation, Russia did. Russia should leave without conditions and delay.
Still buying oil from Russia. How is that. Allowing Russia to continue the pipeline to Germany is the key to this invation cause now Putin got billions of dollars from this pipeline. So Germany and Biden administration is the blame for all this. This administration is doing it purposely to destroy America. Hang them all and the supporters. Period.
Will the dead people come back alive after the war is stopped ? Russia has wiped population of the The world. let curse be upon the aggressor
Bullshit, You do a cease fire. And Russia keeps fighting. Russia is on drug's. Sounds like Russia is losing. You would still have to pay for damages in Ukraine. And resign from UN. Before we kick you out.
Sounds like there will be no deal then.
All the communists countries are liers, same they'll claim the whole global will be thiers, common,  let people's live
it's russia's weak moment , it's good opportunity to make a good nuclear attack on russia by the world to get rid of it!
And what are his demands?
CHINA is waiting for Putin to where down his army's  and become week and then China will roll into Russia and take the lot
Mr putin sir the ukrainians  will stop fighting if there is a  cease fire à very good  suggestion will be to position indian and chineese  and turkish Azerbaïdjan  and armenian  forces  to patron along the  countries it has to be stop because of so much sufferings
Didn't mention any of the demands, great  foolish INDIAN ...
He is only one person..the russian people must overthrow this crazy leader
No CEASEFIRE, NO WAY;  HE NEAD TO BE " CHEEKED MATE "
Putin is a liar as Ukraine are only defending their own country  , this as Russia is out to try take over their country ..Russia is way in the wrong big time .
Well done erdoğan
💖🙏🙏🙏💖Beloved JESUS...
Putin's demand is that Ukraine become a puppet state of Russia. Fvck Putin.  He is realizing that Russia can not suppress Ukraine forever. Nor can he keep it a secret from Russian citizens much longer.
Moscow demands Moscow.
This channel isn't a channel. Its fucking clickbait, bastardized to no end. Loop B-roll AND narration?
Putin needs to go.  If Ukraine stops fighting Putin will crush them , hes all lies lies dont fall for it
Putin is losing the war and brought russian into unnecessary suffering. Putin need to be kick out from power asap. Let not make deal with rusia until putin no longer in power.
Breaking news: Russia's demands have not changed
The insane invader also demands conditions to stops the war.  You judge that. To me...Putin is scared he usually prideful make his guests wait for him but now wait to welcome them at the verandah.  Just and Truth is haunting Putin.
Every dog gets there day.the flames of hell will enjoy all evil....
Why would uk stop fighting when they are in their home,you invade them.leave their home so they will stop fighting. Simple as it is
¡NO PASARAN!  🍀🇮🇪🇺🇦🍀
Adolf Putin is a war criminal. Like Hitler you will be destroyed.
Mr. Putin is a great leader in the world. He is a honest and right leader . Russia is a 100% right. The United States, Nato, and Zelensky are all responsible for this war.
Why talk with putin? - nothing he says can be believed.
This is do as we say or else.  Screw russia.
Get rid of rid of this crack pot already!!!
"Conditions".....basically means that the Ukraine looses its entire defence force,and "bows" down to Putin; can't see that happening.Young guys in the Ukraine are doing 3 days military training....then off to the "battle-front." With that sort of mentality...."PutRID" is going to have a battle in his hands.      Best Wishes to everyone in the Ukraine...  from the UK🇺🇦🇬🇧
Russian President should step down & be put in Prison for all his war crimes. his own people dont want this war. & he is putting them in jail for it.
That same demands? Demilitarisation of Ukraine, De-Nazification (elimination of Neo Nazis like Azov), recognition of free Donbas region and recognition of Russia's Crimea.
Their demands.
If Ukraine stops fighting 🤦‍♂️ Russias invading Ukraine not the other way around
Only USA will suffer due to Sanctions !! Because, USD will not be used by a country like Russia which owns 55% of oil trade, which will happen through other currencies. Which will slowly depriciate the USD Currecy value and lead to a another Economic crisis.. Relax and Watch the Game !! 😜🧐😎😊
What I only know is that, Russia does not want Ukraine to join NATO. But people are mad because Ukraine is a democratic country and Russia wants now to invade Ukraine because they could not keep a promise to not join NATO that Russia do not want to happen. NATO did not give assistance because Ukraine is still not part of them, which is why Ukraine is facing alone Russia in this war, that shouldn’t have happened if only Ukraine still keeps the neutrality. Am I even making sense about this?
Putin's conditions is just another way to say to Ukraine to surrender.
The news of Stupidity
I hope everyone just cuts Russia off from the Rest of the world, Cripple there Economy thanks to the Putin’s Old Man Decision.
Surrender isn't a condition it's capitulation, fight on Ukraine
Putin has walked himself into a confrontation he can not win. and as that realization begins to dawn on him - he will get more and more reckless. His generals are either resigning or being killed on the battlefield. This has been disastrous for not just Ukraine & Russia... The Germans have now decided to "re-arm" and any student of history will that you that's not necessarily a good thing. Hmm...
We'll stop if you surrender and give us everything we want... that's not very diplomatic, but instead shows that they want to keep going on the war.
Second China
WOW, and I thought CNN sucked. 🤭😁😂🤣
That's like saying no ceasefire until you surrender. Is this what Zelenski wants?
Putin wants to install his boy in Ukraine. Putin needs to be overthrown by his own people.
this is bullshit, nothing
what a waste of 1:52 minutes of my life
How nice...one dicator meets another to ask him to stop his actions. Kind of ironic...
Whatever a complete ass hate putin is.
What a news, sucks!
Second China
That's good agreement...
❤🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪❤
Russia can get ukraine to stop fighting without even setting demands, if they simply leave the fucken country 🙄
PUTIN IS BETTER THAN USA! ! THINK OF THAT!
Hang on, the US did this to half a dozen different countries, killing millions of civilians.  We're going to ignore that?
The CIA wants every country to bow down and become a puppet regime, and Putin will not tolerate missles on their borders.  What is so difficult to understand.
You’re ‘ special’ too, Vladimir Vladimirovich.
RUSSIA IS WORLD POWER FOREVER
Ukr will meet Russia concerns but Ukr should counter offer on condition of Putin to resign all his political posts.
War is destructive and harmful for all countries. Due to the effect of COVID pandaemic economy of all countries in the world is disturbed. As a result of this war both Russia and Ukraine will be severely effected and all countries in the world will be effected to some extent. So, friends let us unite together against this war. We want peace, peace, peace and say no to war. Convey this message to all to strongly protest against this war.  IT IS NOT THE TIME FOR WAR. BOTH PRESIDENTS OF RUSSIA AND UKRAINE ARE TAKING VERY WRONG DECISIONS. THE WAR MUST BE STOPPED IMMEDIATELY.  WE DO NOT WANT WAR... WE DO NOT WANT WAR... WE DO NOT WANT WAR...  WE WANT PEACE, PEACE AND ONLY PEACE......
This war was to do with the president  of Ukraine and putin, putin never had a problem with people in there only Ukraine president. It's a bit weird how he was the only one that putin wanted then all of a sudden  Russians have been captured the Ukraine take there clothes dress up as Russian do real bombs and blame Russian.
Clickbait or what?
Appalling coverage absolutely appalling this channels should be taken down with this BS
Why is there no mention of Azoff battalion  in the mainstream media? If Azoff battalion is for white supremacy, how is it that zelensky is Jewish?
This takes away Ukraine a right and ability to join NATO. Ukraine has been an independent country since the fall of the Soviet Union.
The warmongering "small tzar" DICTATOR and WAR CRIMINAL DO NOT SET any condition at all. The ONLY CONDITION is for the "small tzar Hitler" to GET OUT OF RUSSIA UNCONDITIONAL. UKRAINE 🇺🇦 🇺🇦  UKRAINIANS FOREVER.  GOD BLESS UKRAINE AND ITS PEOPLE.. YOUR STRUGGLE IS FOR FREEDOM, DEMOCRACY and JUSTICE.🙏
Just hit the dislike button.  What a waste of time.
But what are the demands
Another condition might be the whole world must worship. PUTIN THE GREAT
So PooTin wants the Ukrainians to stop fighting an aggressor and merely give way to him. What a load of bollox.
What does Putin what's?
Inacceptable conditions.. as Ukrain seek to join NATO.
This terrorist needs to be put before the Hague for war crimes and Russia needs to rebuild Ukraine for free
The only condition that Moscow must meet is that all sanctions of finances that the west has frozen be use to repair all the damages that Russia imposed on Ukraine and that all Russians military and separatists leave Ukraine and recognize Ukraine as an independent state.  If Putin wants Ukrainians from fighting, all Putin has to do is order all Russian military to go back to the Russian border. Otherwise, FU Russia.
They shuld Tell the PEOPLE that this WAR COMES FROM USA, Not from PUTIN! ZELENSKY is in the CLUB of KLAUS SCHWAB Like TRUDEA & BEARBOCK! WAKE UP ! SLAVERY COMING OUR WAY! WAKE UP!
We need to end Putin with a surgical strike on Moscow
Has his demands changed? You said there were Demands that needed to be met could you specify? Have they changed from before?
So if Ukraine refuses the war is on Ukraine.
I do recall Turkey invading Cyprus in 1974 and is still occupying the northern half of the island which has been ethnically cleansed of Greeks.
This clip never explains what the demands are
What kind of fight? the conditions  both arms and feet are tied up and the enemy is beating.
I can see what these so-called helpers are trying to do: not upset Russia by intervening at the last minute and seeking to allow Russia to take the territories they are now controlling, similar to Crimea and the others 🤔.  If only Ukraine could do without the rest of the world 🌎 🤔 who let them down...
SO......we let the BULLY, set DEMANDS ????? I thought we didn`t associate with TERRORISTS !!!
All these countries that are helping Putin should have sanctions against them and do not let their people into this country!
Força Rússia 🇵🇹🤝🇷🇺✌️✌️
EVERYONE JUST STAY SEATED WE ARE TURNING AROUND TO THE AIRPORT TO HAVE OUR DEMANDS MET. This is pretty much the same thing.
Stop fighting? He started it? Go back to russia and it will stop
What are the demands???? Probably everything to do with the end of the NWO plan...but MSM brainwashers won't tell u the demands
Why can’t Ukraine think logically and act rationally. What are they waiting for at this time.
Mental ill your time is coming soon
Neo-Nazis and fascists of Ukraine must die!
He is in no position to set conditions! Out of office soon!!!!
Would be good if you could list Moscow's demands - or was it just for Ukraine to stop fighting.
This dude is delusional When he is the aggressor.
Rssuia is the winer ???**********
if USA, EU and NATO agree with the DEMAND of Pyutin, then they are giving Pyutin the DOOR for his MISSION👉 TO restore USSR and  Constantinople!  Pres Erdogan, be extra Careful, Your KINGDOM is the NEXT!
They’re not “Sanctions” they’re special economic conditions,,, jajajajajaj🤣
Where are the conditions...?
Putin can kiss the brown eye
The president of ukrenia should not stop fighting to he takes his country back and conquer russia it self he have the fighting man and woman and if he regroup and kp receiving out siders to fight for freedom and the world future he can free his country and conquer russia Hannibal the cartage did it to Rome with the iberians peninsula celts front liners and with 50 different tribes and languages what he nd is us the so call Latinos today to go in and defend and hold the front lines becouse we are the ancients iberians peninsula celts blood lines and it being proven in USA army that we are the best war machines in earth we out us the USA army is weak real weak special us the Ricans now is another human that can go with us to fight the front lines and their call wild gueese irish blood lines our brothers by blood plus north scotland the rest are to tall to weak to slow they eat to much take to much space and used to much oxygen and nd to much water we the iberians celts blood lines mostly 5"8 on high the best build to defeat anyone anyplace any where man to man combat now he nd us to go in and we all will conquer Russia no mercy no prisoners then china north korea and who ever come to wa waooo in our empire we are the spaniard alano bulldog war machines real simple russian will be a practice target for us for the next war real simple freedom

no points made in 2 minutes. wow!!!
What a clickbait pile of bullshit. What are the demands ffs??
What kinda report is this?
the world needs to set condition, putin gtfo or a price tag on his head.
So what are the demands??
Disappointed with WIONs stand on calling it an invasion. Seems it was a mistake that WION to believe that it was not a FOR SALE media, and its views would be inline with our govt's. Guess, at the end of the day, money talks.
if those news updates are as uninformed as this ,where the tiltle really says as much as the video itself . id keep that app away from my phone
General Patton was right. We should have taken down Russia right after WWII, chicken shit Country.
What are the 'conditions" Putin is demanding be met?
Foolish putin. Ukraine only fight for their freedom because putin directive is to invade it. Ukrianians only act as normal while  putin in abnormal state of mind
What Zelensky achieved so far? Big ZERO n he is the sole reason for Ukrain’s current situation…. I feel very sorry for innocent n very emotional Ukrainians…. Leader’s first priority is to keep his country n his people safe…then he should think of improving life of people n country but definitely not at the cost of citizens life (pls understand - risking life of military is completely different than risking life of innocent citizens (including kids n older ppl)….. Zelensky should have secured his country first instead of going head on with Russia/Putin … It’s very simple to understand … just compare Zelensky’s actions with NATO or America (why NATO or America not going head on with Russia/Putin???) Whereas Zelensky trusted other powerful countries n risked his country n citizens life without thinking much (this shows immaturity n inexperience in politics)…. He should have made smarter moves than risking his country for other nations interests… god bless Ukrainians…🙏🙏🙏
So …… did any one get those demands
And, Moscow's demands are what?
if Zelensky wants he can stop the war at any moment, he trusted the idiots.
Tell him to go swallow a nuc. Funny how he’s supposedly so powerful but his first order is that THEY stop fighting. Poor puty pants. They aren’t giving you squat!
i  am  from  India...i  need  naan....shut yer' yapper Miss India NATO on Russia's doorstep and you *expect* Putin to roll out the welcome mat???
What are the demands? What a waste of time this video is…
What about the conditions Putin and his generals must face for murdering innocent people.
India is on Russia's side obviously. Unsubscribed*
Ya—Russia leaves Ukraine unconditionally!
What kind of news reporting is that?!!  Hasn't reported anything...repeats nothing.. like a wind up doll.
It's too late .. damaged has been done
Praying for a world peace specially  for Ukraine.. and the entire world 🙏🙏🙏
Turkey Erdogan and Israel PM are the relay station.
@wion news, your videos have high frequency audio output... It makes uncomfortable to listen. Not sure what makes it but if you can please improve on your side.
Putins a proven liar… I wouldn’t give him any demands
Complete and total surrender just like its been all along, unconditional surrender. They should name a holiday after Mr. Putin. Putin Day.
Ukraine won't give Russia nothing so its game on still
Accepting Russian conditions is too early for covid narrative...
So, what are the demands?
get Russian troops out of Ukraine first ,. Ukraine stop fighting don't do it Putin been lying all along
Ok.... so what did he say? LOL This is terrible news reporting.
And? What are putins demands? This is not a news story, it’s the start of one …
I think Den Haag wants a word with him. He will not be able to escape the Tribune now, his days are numbered.  My heart and mind goes out to Ukraine, stay safe people!
Sorry Putin they don't want 2 work for dollar a day
I'm not interested in Putin's conditions.  Putin is going to submit to Ukrainian conditions before this is over.
.no ...Putin retreat then then the fighting will stop ...you invaded Ukraine
Yes Russia already said this and the leader of Ukraine said we're not going to bow to any thing Russia wants us to do... This is what started the invasion and Russia's going to offer the same thing again like there's a difference today... With a really give up and say okay let's do what Russia says after all those people have died fighting for the freedom... I don't think so.... It's all a part of the Great Big show... It's called The Apocalypse must be televised...
Ukraine needs to stop killing other Ukrainians simply because they speak Russian. The Biden's of the U.S. interfered where  they should have. The U.S. cares nothing for Ukraine as much as it cares about who Russia sells it's gas and oil to.!
I cannot imagine that someone is going to come, blow up my house, invade my property and say that they will stop invading unless I stop fighting. These are the  most ludicrous demands that Russia has made and that I have heard in my life.  I would be furious as anyone else and I would fight till I finish them. The world needs to continue to stand against this Russian bully and continue with the sanctions and with supplying arms to Ukraine so that they can defend themselves. Turkey is a hypocrite to NATO, the EU and the US,  because it does not want to lose its friendship with Russia.
0:39 Putin went for a spud but realised that guy was not black 🤣🤣🤣
OUr bafoon is nowhere in the picture for a peace ful settlement of the ukraine crisis.
Thanks for the info Captain Obvious
PUTIN IS SCARED  NO TO ANY CONDITION  NOW THAT THE WORLD IS AGAINST HIM AND CHINA SHOULD THINK TWICE IF HE DOES COOPERATE WITH RUSSIA THE WORLD IS MOBILIZING TO BRING ALL DICTATORS IN THE WORLD DOWN ENOUGH WITH THE DICTATORS EGO TOO MUCH PRIDE AND HUNGRY FOR  POWER  THIS IS JUST AN OPINION
No gangsta are powerful then this people just wow
every other country who are friend of russia trying to finish this war peacefully
That's a nice video of two leaders shaking hands in palatial cleanliness
wtf are the demands ????
ANYONE who believes anything Putin promises is just plain "OUT TO LUNCH permenetly he is a criminal always has been, the same as several others I could mention!
Mr edoegan when are given weapons as NATO member to palistine to defend themselves in their own country, hypocrisy Allah will never until kiyama support NATO and America in sha Allah
Someone must put lead in Putin’s frontal lobe. That’s the only way this all ends
In other words Putin will not stop until Ukraine is no more an sovereign country and becomes part of his rule. When will the world step in to end this. What are they afraid of? Remember all countries of the world that once the Ukraine disappears will show Putin's that he can hold the entire world hostage. Remember to those countries who think by allying themselves with Russia only falls into Russian rulers themselves because Putins allies will not be ALLOWED to say no to anything Russia tells them to do or believe. Just giving fair warning. Remember China knew about the invasion before it happened. China, remember that you are putting your trust in a regime know to lie through their teeth. You aren't the only ones wanting world domination. Russia wants it too as well as Iran. The citizens won't know the difference because you pretty much do the same thing anyway. Any type of freedom is foriegn to them. There is no way even your own ruling(lol) leadership will have a say. So, everyone sit on their cowardly hands saying we don't want to start WW3. Sorry to inform the world that it has already started. Go ahead and deny the dangers of Putin advancing beyond Ukraine like Ukraine denied it. You see what happened there. And to willingly to destroy/endanger other countries by threatening/use  nuclear weapons and reactors is totally irrational and insane. That is the big difference between him and NATO (and other countries who has nuclear power. ) Just because you have that capacity doesn't mean you can use it without knowing that it will always be a total no win situation. And whoever does pull the first trigger(even by proxy)will not have a friend or ally in the world for making the world unlivable for everyone. Everyone will be affected. So Putin, if you pull that trigger, you signed your own dreams good bye. You will be emperor of a giant sand dune. Enjoy Idiot!!!
Slava Ukraini!,
I don't care,let's NATO ADOPT UKRAINE AS THEIR STATE IMMEDIATELY AND STRIKE DOWN THIS RUSSIA MAD MAN.
I will never surrender but I will die for my country
lol news nowadays  are a joke, repeating same shit 4 times😂
IGNORE putin
Every time  cease fire he increases you have to have his own people turn on him hopefully a coup
Yup.  Surrender, come under Moscow’s rule and we will stop killing you!  Nothing changes.
That's a dictate, not a negotiation.
IGNORE
One line sentence repeating 2 minutes
🙈🙈🙈🙈🙈🙈🙈🙈🙈🙈 I don't want to see tbe face if Putin please 🙈🙈🙈🙈🙈🙈🙈🙈🙈🙈👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹
They have to get Putin a lil wee booster seat to step up on. Hes so short and pasty looking. Evil guy to.
It makes no sense, zuktsine Has to fall to Hitler-tin and stop fighting got him to stop the invasion.  What does he do in return, just stop the deaths?  How about he lets them be free so he can concentrate on helping his country return to some form of humanity?
Uhhm, did you actually tells us what his conditions are? Care to?
Nonsense! 1st of all Putin full well understands that Ukraine is not going to stop fighting as he bombs them. Putin needs to stop attacking the the Ukr. But the entrance of Erdrogon is a good sign
Never, ever,  trust a communist.
Putin is such a liar that the opposite is true.
UKRAINE DON'T GIVE IN TO PUTIN HE'S AN EVIL!!!!
What a waste of 1 min 52 seconds... so what are the conditions set by Moscow....??
Check mate of Putin, King of world, Russia against NATO, and all world, stay Russia strong  forever
Stupid newscaster, repeat the same thing
What are their demands?
Hope Palki Sharma Upadhyay will tell us about Russian demands in gravitas on Monday. 😋
Putin no rights to abuse other countries. He is not God.  👎👎👎👎👎👎
Putin says if Ukraine surrenders unconditionally he will stop invading?  Breaking news indeed!
4ussiabgot joe moma
Bom die poes uit Moscow en sien waar die tjips val
Putin invaded, so he needs to stop and withdraw.
What demands
whats conditions ?
They'll stop invading if the the Ukrainian people stop fighting? Double standards? I think so. Please just stop this war. ☮️ on planet Earth.
Kind of vague this News from WION.
Don't believe that lie Ukrainians. He want you to stop fighting so his take over can succeed. Only stop fighting until they leave
What are Putins demands?
Wion never did, explain the “Conditions”
Well someone gotta agree to stop this war. People around the world don't really understand how the Russia-Ukraine war can escalate to a world war 3!. Literally it requires only one country to involve in the war and that's it. Sanctions might be a way to have an negative impact on russian economy but that doesn't stop Putin and his nuclear weapons. Instead that triggers the situation furthermore. I really hope this war will end as soon as possible and that peace can take place between these countries!
Bendover joe biden
Of all the leaders available...  Erdogan?  Really?
Anyone care to guess what Putin's conditions are?
What are the conditions 😡 Tell me
She’s very cute. ♥️♥️♥️
Sir Vladimir Putin is a genius and should be nominated for the next world dictatorship. Russia is great and will defeat America with the help of China when World War III breaks out later this year. I might move to Monte Carlo that would be a good place to reside during a World War.
1:16 Dodged that😆
To hell with Putin ..Democracy must prevail ..This is the most important war since world War 2. This war for democracy is going on in America. Republicans are trying to make it harder to vote, which will help the Republicans win and in return destroy democracy.
Comment from the United States is he crazy he's telling Ukraine with all of the destruction and the damage to lay down their arms and then he'll leave the rest of the country what's left and the Ukrainian president alive whom he will probably kill you crazy will never meet this demand this is not a truth this is surrender
Reports Putin will stop invasion of Moscows demands are met...doesnt report what demands are...awesome reporting.
Fascist Putin, I love Ukraine,from Vietnam, I don't want to die from a nuclear plant explosion. The world protecting Ukraine is protecting the world itself. Ask the world to help Ukraine. There is no war here, but it hurts me to see so many civilians bombed by Putin's fascists. Ukraine's victory is also my joy from Vietnam,  Fascist , Fascist , Fascist   Fascist Putin🪓🪓🪓🪓🪓🪓🪓🪓🪓🔨🔨🗡🗡
In other words the bully still demands the lunch money
Finally a nation with logic and understanding.     Find Putins demand and end it.     Starting a global war because of this is seriously goofy
What are Moscow's conditions? Not very concise here ...
Looks like pootin wants to give up cause he's military getting defeated in Ukraine. Putin can't be trusted.
Conditions? In our dreams Putin.
ALL THE WOLRD MUST CALL PUTIN    , THE MURDERER,     BUT NOT PERSIDENT
My sincere apologies to Ukrainian women for what Brazilian Deputy Arthur do Val said about Ukrainian women. He said: "Ukrainian women are easy because they are poor. I will come back here for a sex tour." We Brazilians reject the speech of this deputy and do not agree with his attitude of taking advantage of women in a time of war, where people are afraid of dying and vulnerable. This deputy does not represent us. Arthur do Val has to lose his mandate urgently here in Brazil, he does not represent us.
Putin and Trump too of the biggest liars in the world. if Trump was president he would make Putin vice president 🤣
Putin, you can't seek to satisfy your self in another man country, who are you to do that, you shall see.
i still don't get what's going on here. like is he gonna pull out of Ukraine and leave them alone or something? (this feels like a trick)
And what are Russia’s demands??  This isn’t news, this is repeating the news companies who actually report the news. You’re not NEWs, you’re old hearsay. Smh
Madam, what are these conditions?
CHARGES PUTIN WITH VIOLATION OF HUMAN RIGHT / GENOCIDE / INVASION  AND WAR CRIME  TEACH ALL DICTATOR A LESSON DO LIKE WHAT THE ROMANS DID  CRUCIFY  PUTIN IN THE MIDDLE OF RUSSIA  AND MAKE THE RUSSIAN PEOPLE PAY AND REBUILT UKRAINE  VICTORY FOR FREEDOM AND PEACE THIS IS AN OPINION
Demand can't be bigger than peace. Ukraine should meet the needs in time.
What are the demands?
Turkey would know...they invaded Cyprus in 1974 .. slaughtered thousands of Greeks and illigal occupaied a third of the island
putin is confuse know ukrain win the war o ready
What are those demands ?
This is called "Russian Roulette!" You first!🤔
Even if Russia stops fighting, the sanctions will stay. So why would he stop
What are Moscow's demands then? to take over Ukraine? LOL. Ukraine won't allow that.
How's this "Breaking News" ... its more like; nothing have changed.
Putin understand who is BOSS NOW!!!! And the reason turkey has influence is because historically turkey defeated them,the ottomans,so who is boss!
Wow ! This is really good . Thank you God for hearing our prayers for humanity . We Filipinos are very very happy because God always hear our prayers . Thank you Lord , Thank you Jesus . Amen
The moment they became democratic and not puppet controlled, Putin did everything to subvert it. He funded the separatist with money and weapon. So of course Ukraine made demand for weapons and to be in NATO knowing that the separatist where in fact Russian assets.  Which is only logical.  So in others words they would have to give up their democracy and their ability to govern themself for his peace. So this is like if UK submitting to the Nazi's during WWII. Putin funding the separatist had nothing to do with the Ukraine government giving drilling right to external companies to tap the very large gas deposits there which they just find around the same time as the change in government.
Maybe mentioning in detail what those demands are would be useful?
Putin the worst leader at present. His historical behaviour itself says.
U GUYS KNOW u can watch AUSTRIA news AND RUSSIA took ukraine in  a week they ARE LIE n the west is NOT BEING HONEST the UKRAINE ARMY took off or captured HELLLLLLLOOOO the UKRAINE PEOPLE THEMSELVES TELL U NO ukraine military is here in this city or that city
Ahhh….he agreed to turn himself in to the UN to be tried for war crimes?  Pootie the thug.
And the demands are......... Drumroll please......
For the first time on this Channel, this clip must be the worse report ever I have heard so far.
Wow it was a special op. Follow what Putin says, so what are his rules
Putin is a security risk to the world. He started this war, the world needs to continue economic sanctions till Putin is demilitarized. Moscow is the one that needs to be "denazified.
Delusions and grandeur. Final form of all dictators who went insane.
That bald fascist is destroying the lives of millions of people, including Russians, but he will never conquer Ukraine.
NATO must not abandon hardware on Ukraine border
NATO rejects Ukraine no-fly zone request, says 'we are not part of this' war  - Reuters  But they want India, Saudi, UAE, Turkey and so on to be part of the war! Lol
Bare chested riding a horse.  Putin definitely gay.
Is asking to surrender without coubterpart. Ukraine people will never do that. On the contrary are hating Russans more and more. No issue. Might become a second Viet Nam. On the other hand Putin is isolated in Kremlin more and more. There fore has to accélérateur but can not. This is why and Ukrainiens know it
United states invaded and bombarded countries and no sanctions against, why is that?
useless shit news
Germany sends old moldy weapons to Ukraine ? NATO will lose Ukraine ? 2Q 4. U. Aloha.
Yeah,sounds great. I’ll walk over into my neighbor’s yard and start beating the crap out of him. But,I’ll tell him that I’ll stop as long as he stops trying to defend himself. Sounds rational.
The demands are invisible since she never mention them. What a waste of time watching this video.
In other words, Putin will not stop soon.
Nato and Ukraine gave Putin no choice
LoL. All for nothing putin just let your army go back home to their family.
Plot twist Erdowan Stabs Putin in the face/neck war over
Sound like a joke
So what is the condition Moscow wants meet?  Reporters are so damn stupid.  Do reporters understand how damn dumb they sound
Putin sir!!! Ur the man.......just wow
Someone set up a meeting with Putin then america will hit him with nuclear missiles from space that only take 30 seconds to make contact
If stop the war first thing  he has  to surrender  to the  international  courts  for war crimes  and take his chances  with them.
The Ukrainian army must take a smarter approach to stopping these evil maniacs and the answer is: SNIPERS, THOUSANDS of them placed strategically everywhere the Russian troops and middle sites are located. Imagine this: 10 thousand SNIPERS with singular targets only. One target per SNIPER. They all take aim with scopes and fire in unison at their chosen targets. Assuming they hit their targets complete chaos will follow. The SNIPERS should be deployed in groups of 1000 all along the routes used by Russia. ALL bridges and shallow streams should be rigged to explode. All flat fields and valleys should be mined as well.  All sewer lids should be booby trapped , all sources of fresh water should be made unpotable. Only subterranean wells and protected sources should be used by the Ukrainian army and their citizens. All Russian soldiers that shoot against the Ukrainian army or its people should be HUNG along the routes into the country.  A dead body has no purpose and the heads of Russian soldiers should be displayed along the routes into the country.  Okay you all think I am a cruel person for suggesting such barbarism but TRUST ME, the Russians have no problem killing woman and children, that much is certain.  To kill someone with the intent of displaying them is wrong but if the are dead already as a result of their own aggression I say use it against them.  FEAR IS A VERY USEFUL TOOL in war.  I hate WAR, I abhor violence but they started this invasion, they killed your people without a thought to the damage they were inflicting on your country and your families.  All bets are off now !! They started this fight and now, it’s up to the men and woman of Ukraine to finish it.  I pray for your victory and wish my own country didn’t have such a Bafoon in the Whitehouse.   You can win and you must!! Sending LOVE and prayers to you all.  🇺🇸✌🏻🇺🇸✌🏻🇺🇸✌🏻🇺🇸✌🏻🌹
Putin the war criminal can't get is own way!This war is not just  Putin's fault it's NATO if NATO gave Ukraine NATO status then this war would be a completely different than the one we have got today!Putin must pay for this...The world can't just continue watching the onslaught of the russians.santions isn't going to stop putin.china fund.russian army invade.putin then demand the Ukraine people to stop fighting.can someone remind him who started this war?
He's lying.    keep fighting, we'll keep arming you and isolate Russia.  Just get the non-combatants out.
Eukraine has a right to choose the security alliance of their own choice, Neto, EU OR UN
Турция - страна НАТО. Почему Путин не боится Турции?
Mmm more off a false flag .. if he said that ..give up your weapons .. and then what .. ?
Russia 🇷🇺 and Ukraine 🇺🇦 are one people, is just another brain wash by the west .
Please Ukraine please stop fighting because we are all scared and if you do putin will stop
I just un subscribed from this channel    over another video saying ukraines war was natos fault    which is BS    So here putin will stop if his demands are met!  Oh yes What demands? the  same as before i guess,So ukraine has to agree to not join nato,and be russia friendly?well ukraine is another of the soviet block countries that became independant after the fall of the berlin wall.Putin has no right to make such demands,should they wish as they do to be an EU country,Or if they want to join nato.putin truly thought the people of ukraine would welcome him as a saviour,Well that is clearly not the case or the ukrainians,many of whom are proud of their russian roots,would not be blowing up his equipment,killing his soldiers,and shooting his planes and choppers down.he is just exploiting the fact ukraine was not yet an EU member,or a nato member. There can be no conditions the ukrainians have to comply to.Thats the message they are sending loud and clear.
If their demands are stated, the world would know that Ukraine is at fault. So, the justified demands must not be revealed at any cost.
Turkey is a NATO country. Why is Putin not afraid of Turkey?
Moscow's demands can't be met. Putin wants the Ukrainians to give up, promise not to be a 'real' country, and allow Putin to do anything he wants to in Ukraine. Those aren't demands, those are Putin's delusions.
Biden calls them Mandates, in the United States.  So far his greatest accomplishment, other than creating poverty, hate and dissension.
What's putin's demands?
I fill this largely down to NATO, as we are braking our agreement with Russia that NATO would not enter the Baltic states and they have, I’m not condoning a invasion, but this has been going on for twenty years in which time Russian grievances have been ignored, i think the west need s to look at this fairly and not keep covering the truth up.
What are the conditions? Thanks for letting us know
Putin could well have had an agreement before he attacked and killed innocent people had he not underestermated the valour and courage of Ukraine. Ukraine would never have been put in this position had they of kept their nukes, but as per usual we told them we'd protect them if they gave them up, but our deeds have failed to match our words.  Putin must answer for war crimes, and we must ensure that in future, NATO, for what is worth, makes it clear to anyone that steps out of line and risk war in Europe, that they will be dealt with straight away. Whats the point of being the most powerful force in the world, if NATO just sits back and watch this distruction and death of so many innocent people.
Is this true... I certainly hope it is...
Ukraine is defending itself not attacking.  Russia wants to annex half of Ukraine.
Nothing to see here, move along, don’t waste your time watching this like I did.
He is evil this could have been resolved he destroyed half or most of the country and want his demands to be met how evil...demanding and a dictator...
"Tili tili bom..." Those who speak Russian know this creepy lullaby. "Someone is knocking outside the house..." For the younger generation of Russians I suggest they should listen to it. It sounds soothing but the words are chilling. Perhaps for the Russians of today, the music has a deafening effect and they can't hear the words. Or maybe, Putin has put them well to sleep and can't make out the true meaning of the song. Either way, the threatening shadow who is waiting outside has already numbed their brains with fear and paralyzed their will.
What a plonker..
Condition LISTE TO ME OR DIE +) Very good conditions
At least there is one Europe leader that wants to save Ukrainian people instead of pushing ego. Hopefully the rest will follow.
Basically he wants Nato to go back to where it was in the 90s so he can line up and launch against Moldova .  This is his pattern. Can't you see he is just repeating the same thing over and over. started with chechnia .
This news clip has nothing in it. Junk reporting
Treaties and agreements between nations are meant to be respected otherwise nothing else matters.
Eventually the same agreement will be reached, that could have been reached...before fighting broke out. Meaning: no NATO and no EU membership for Ukraine, and semi autonomy for the eastern break away provinces.
Putin lies, lies, lies and lies and lies and this moderator shows zero empathy!
What r Moscow's demands
Aprox 88 % citizens of india ..strongly support russia...🇮🇳🇷🇺🇮🇳 (According to survey by news channel in india.)
Do we still have Ukraine or we have former Ukraine since there are rubbles and ruins all over the country
They will never surrender. This war is Putin's war - The beast must die !
Yep just like what we would expect the terms are unfair and ridiculous. How about these terms Russia pulls out and never returns with an army, problem solved peace at last and then Russia must pay reparations to families in Ukraine and rebuild all the damage they did.
If that was news it leaves a lot to the imagination.
But Putin didn't get mad?
what a laughingstock of news org...   what were the confitions????!!!
WWIII has already started
No, instead grandpa Biden wants eurp NATO countries to get involved. Meaning a declaration of ear on Russia  The Ukraine should surrender, instead pushing ww3
what are those conditions?
The new world order 10 Horn beast! I’m so puzzled here and wondered if anybody else could see this? When a country put’s sanctions on another country to cause them to collapse financially isn’t it considered to be a siege already and a declaration of war. I mean really think about this, because this is probably way we’re gonna see 1/3 of all mankind die over this. Definitely the news media is running with a narrative that doesn’t suit us very well and is going to drag it all into a World war! I’m very sorry about what’s happening in Ukraine, there’s no doubt about that. because we have churches there also in the United Pentecostal Chrch. So there are people that we care for there also! I think Russia went in anyways and started this because Russia was constantly being threatened by NATO, the United Nations and the European Union which I consider to be the teen horn  beast! In the Bible In the book of Daniel chapter 7 , you will notice that the beast has power to keep people from buying or selling. Which leads me to My second question! who is the most evil out of all these people on the world stage today? the beast that is sanctioning everyone and will be able to sanction the world one day? and anyone who doesn’t follow the beast, or bow to the New World order? Is the worst people out of all the Russia nation who might be seeing this beast from NATO rising up to sanction its people and force it to go to war by threatening the country of Russia, creating a narrative that will Drive them into all into a One world war With NATO?  Is the worst government out of all these people the government Ukraine where Biden and Hunter Biden has been doing inappropriate business dealings in the past for so many years? Behind closed doors using the White House presidential jet to fly back-and-forth and make loads of illegal money  off the poor people in Ukraine while they starve? I mean really does anybody remember the hunter Biden laptop Scandal still being swept under the rug even today? Where is the real evil in the news media with the news cast that we’re here every day adding blame to Russia and turning the Russians into the bogeyman out today? After all the news media is supposed to be finding out what the real truth is about all of this but I don’t see them being able to do any of this at all only lining up a narrative causing more confusion, more hate and more war of course putting our lives in jeopardy with their so-called narrative because sooner or later Russia will press the button after hearing in having to deal with all of this don’t you think? Again which one of these my friends is the worst of the worst you tell me because I’m sick of hearing this garbage and the news media and the narrative knowing that they could’ve worked with each other and really had peace from the beginning! But all we heard was don’t you dare do that or we will  lay sanctions on you Russia! And Rosie not really wanting to go to war with Ukraine but just trying to flex his muscles against the New World beast call the European Union, the United Nations and NATO while all the while trying to keep NATO from crouching into the Russian territory. Which ones are the worst out of all these? can I ask you my friends? will anyone take the time to ponder over any of this or are you all lost in the fog of war and the news medias crowd mentality, like a bunch of lemons going over the cliff! I’ll because many say go this way! Beware of what you see in here for you are living in the last days and this is why we have perilous times! I wonder how many Christians are caught up in all this cloud of confusion and have forgotten that the Bible says to think on whatsoever is lovely, whatsoever is of a good report.
What are Putin demands? Are they in acceptable motion for all concerned, or only for him???
Better listen to his 'demands', and give them weight
Putin mist resign immediately! Dictator, war criminal, mad man.
What are Putin's demands? Stop fighting! Russia is coming after them. I wouldn't stop if someone was trying to kill me. You fight back until you can't no more! America please send fighter jets for the Ukraine Army to use. They need these now.
If Russia lied many times, it can lie one million times more.  Don't trust Russia...
I love how the people that have watched this one clip are flaming this channel. It's an alert people that's all it is wion comes out with alerts until they get a story together with the facts. This channel mostly has been condemning the attacks, Putin for doing this for his own personal gains. You would have need to watch some of the other videos to understand. This channel if anything has been against Putin right from the start.
Demands could mean , lay down your weapons and we will let you live under Russian governance . Terms could mean , ceasefire on both sides and Russian forces go back to Moscow.  So sorry, can we be friends again?
May God bless people of Russia & Ukraine.
These demands coming from a country that said they aren't invading Ukraine, then invades Ukraine..
India should maintain neutrality.
Who the hell demand the opposition to surrender in war after destroying  everything  and killing hundred and hundred of people😂😂😂... Unreasonable and completely nonsense... Ukrainian are fighting for their homeland from their own soil and how can someone expect them to give up their nation.. Foolish Putin🤭.. Funny part is invader side laying condition to real owner from owner soil..
Here’s a condition .. Putin hands himself in for crimes against humanity !  Perhaps it’s time the world invades Russia
Putin will never take Ukraine fact
Russia wants the whole Ukraine....that is unacceptalble...screw Russia..
no no and no, russia must return all stolen territories and putin must surrender to law enforcement and be tried from criminalistic behavior
when a gentleman speak then they will do as they say but this little Putin is a question of that
Ukraine would be denied entry of NATO and NATO's expansion stops.
I don’t think NATO will give Putin’s  wants  or conditions, both side are ass hole and have high sky pride. If NATO give what Putin wants, that’s like NATO accepting defeat.
The Russians have already broken a ceasefire so Erdogan can urge Putin all he wants...
West is using Ukraine to bring down Russia. US and other countries wants to bring down Russia.  US wants war. I think President Vladimir Putin  is stronger than others, he got a strong spine to fight west.
Beggars cant be choosers
What kinda fugesi report is this . Stop reprating the same thing . Does not increase the credibility of what you are reporting. By the way …. What are the conditions???
You should say " dictator " Putin..not president Putin!!
You said Putin will withdraw..Shame on you.
Demands demands demands, what are these demands.... ?
Basically the rest of the world would have to bow down and say yes master, anything you say master. Stay strong Ukraine ❤️ 🇺🇦
Yes, there seems to be much confusion about what Putin's demands actually are. Please accurate quotation of this. Thank you.
Shouldn't she report the conditions to meet?
American military industrial complex will keep giving Zelensky hope to remain in POWER at the expense of lives lost of its people....  sad but true... The one thing America is good at. People should read the bible it's not going to end well if you keep poking at the bear....  Jo-Bama Is a two headed snake that can't be trusted. Good to see Isis on the rise again now that Obama got his 3rd term.
All that Hass to happen is the president of Ukraine sign a guarantee that Ukraine would never become a member of NATO in the war stops Ukraine will still be a free country they do not give up their freedom the Russians will leave and the Russians are satisfied with nobody mentions is that millions of people streaming into Europe can collapse the European economy
Lmao. What was the title of this video and what was delivered in the video. Same thing being said 10 times. So what were the conditions lmao! Reporting at its best people
stop fighting means surrender and stop this petty rebellion against the russian empire. abandon all hope
This man Pootin, should be hunted down like other lunatics in History and charged and locked away never to be released. And this ridiculous news  update told us nothing.
What conditions?
War has no purpose.  It's just about greed and power.  If Putin wants to end this war then he should be one to lay down his arms first.  After all, he is the one that started the war.
USA must be feeling sad with this war coming to an end 🥲
Russia wants Ukrainians to stop fighting as a condition to peace? That's like me holding someones head under the water and telling them I'll let them go if they quit drowning.
Putin promissed not to invade, and so he did it. Not a man of honor! What if the ucrainians surrender, will he fulfill his words and also stop?
Reality check, America got caught installing the NATO package in Ukraine, Without voting on it with the other NATO countries, Russias going to get in their and finally show whos really got Weapons of mass destruction, Its embarrassment time for America  !
All the war is just for nothing. The owner of the universe is coming back to judge everyone. The book of revelation is unfolding in our very eyes. Let everyone repent of their sins and turn to God
He is lying. He knows nobody in Russia will have access to the information.
Put in rubbish!... he is a sly fox!
the latest news about Russia ukraine
At last compromise is possible. They should met halfway. They are basically brothers.
Russia didn't back down to Germany after they wrongfully invaded them.
Putin is running out of troops and equipment fast he should pull out what's left before it's gone. Ukraine isn't playing around.
pretty much "demands" are a given, sooooo.... what are those demands?
And what the hell is his demands? To get Ukraines president to step aside for a Russian government? No one in Ukraine will ever trust Putin and rather die fighting for their country. If they give up who wants to belong to Russia? And if it happens I still hope no one stop's those sanctions against the Russians. Viva le UKRAINA. REGARDS FROM NORWAY!!!
Putin says one thing and does another. He is robbing the Russian people with his mega corruption
Why do you call a Bloody Russian Dictator something different?
More pressure on please Russia, whatever they may call you, NATO and Co are evil people who killed millions in Iraq Libya Syria Somalia Afghanistan Yemen Lebanon etc
Russia started this war!!!!  Russia simply needs to stop and retreat!!!
You seem to be a dodgy channel, make videos telling snippets of actual news(selectivly) , make videos that tell no story at all..  Then slip in one with conspiracy theories .  Channel seems  to have an agenda??
VLAD THE PUTIN... HE WILL ANSWER TO GOD...
Isn't that obvious.....
With the president of Turkey?  That president isnt in charge of anything.  You cant make a deal with someone that isnt in charge of anything.
this is not invasion, it is rightful intervention to help the real ukraine people, and protect russia and the east.
And who said what?? Feels like preschool mumbo-jumbo to me, lolz 😆
Ukraine should denied, joining NATO, to make the word a peaceful place 😃, for  God sake, and the innocent ones
It is absurd that Russia first Started war without any compelling reason which put entire world at uneasiness and now put condition to end it.
The anchors r stunning on-point n jazzy in their delivery..just this 1  pronunciation ....kills it 4 me...
I demand that you tell me what Russia's demands are and I won't stop asking until my demands are met!
As far as I am concerned, Putin is a war criminal, must be held to account and Russia MUST leave ALL of Ukraine. I would rather fight now, pay the price and not in five or ten years when it will be worse.
Because of these two, world war will happen.
Human rights apply for NATO members 🤡
No nato in Ukraine , that’s his conditions.
What does Ukraine wants aside from joining NATO?
He is trying to back out now, bloody nose, and sanctions are biting. Go for his throat or he will only return later.
Click bate
What exactly does he want?
Putin won't survive unless he wins in Ukraine. Seems to me, a last page in a decades long dictatorship similar to other autocrats his successfulness dictates his next move.
Uraaa
what r the demands again?????     10 times you sd this same thing but never stated what the conditions are?
Putin will reap what he saw one day mark my words.
Freaking psychopath, leave Ukraine 🇺🇦 alone! Did Russia back down to Germany? No, the invaders must be pushed back.
Why cant indian anchors pronounce Putin's name properly..im sure  its  TIN not THIN ..PUTIN.
Worst news provider ever. So stupid. Waste of time.
What are Putin's demands? If Russia stops fighting, I would imagine that Ukraine will stop fighting. Ukraine will not stop as long as Russia is on the attack.
Is anyone going to believe him now? Нет войне!
What a useless coverage.
In other words, Outin demands Ukrainians put down arms  and agree to souring invasion . He must be delusional, orcfeelscWest weakness as he establishes his Putin new world order and geographical border shifts 8n Europe, expanding Russian empire westward
Russia started it. They don’t get to determine which countries can join the EU or NATO.
Very beautiful anchor women
Whatever happened to global health crisis... Do we still have it or Putin's invasion cured it.? Hmm 🤔 i Wonder
Think they just want there numbers up. No other one has said this.
Nuh, his feeling the sunction is already causing great impact he thinks its not too late to stop his bs.
Putin : My conditions , give me Ukraine. Go away.
Now you see that Putin does not want to stop war. He wants annex whole Ukraine. Putimn is neo-Hitler.
The demands are for the Ukraine's to stop resisting and let the Russians take down the Cabal and wipe out the George Soros facilities which are creating a virus more deadlier than COVID.
WOW That was detailed not.......
They  are  killing peoples and  are handshaking  with  laughter   in their  face  ,they  should  have   blown  down  their  own  loved  one  instead   and feel  the  pains  ,Bloody  fools   .
Yawn yawn yawn. Is anyone else fed up with this annoying little fellow.  We should give him a damn good shake up.
Feck Putin!
conditions??? you have to negotiate... your dont have right to rule the whole world..
he aint a man that negotiates. he's losing.
Putin doesn't think for one second he is the aggressor in this conflict. Quite shocking!!
If Russia stops fighting no war. If Ukraine stops fighting no Ukraine.
Oye What are the demands ? Stupid Thumbnails !
Does Putin think Zelenskiy as dull, or the people as too stupid to translate this? Bully: I'll only stop beating you up if you let me beat you - er... I mean, if you stop 'defending' yourself. Victim: Wait, whuut? Bully: Give me everything you got
Why not putting since he’s the king of Russia put his sissy ass over there in Ukraine and fight with his man
WTf has Turkey got to do with anything.
Come to yhe point... what is the condicions
No conditions Putin!!!!!!! YOU caused an unnecessary War!!!!
Putin is a MASS MURDERER
Rubbish click-bait reporting, just like the filthy country where this news channel is from.
Suka Putin
Anything to stop this conflict should be welcome so long as it’s not military. The damage done to Ukraine is too much and Zelenskyy should accept Russia’s proposal in the interim as it can always be renegotiated.
What are the conditions?
Politically Putin's days are over... game over!  Slava Ukraini!
come on I say we all get together and put a end to Putin once and for all , we are all headed for a nuclear war, Biden and company have embolded Russia and China and we are in truble anyway, everything is political and all about the money, our government could care less about who lives or dies our country cant keep on the way it is with total idiots runnig it we are done
PUTIN IS BUYING TIME....HE WANTS THE WHOLE COUNTRY OF UKRAINE. IN 1 MORE WEEK HE WILL HAVE IT. HE SMARTER THAN ALL EXCEPT TRUMP.
Putin is now very scare, he can not control the situation any more he is looking for exit as soon as possible but is late he must be eliminated because he already create to much suffer for humanity, please help Ukrainians people in any way possible, thanks.
LOL the irony of K-erdogan saying that 😂😂😂👌🏼
i think the USA going to war with Russia is not an if at this point but a when.
Ask the dead because the living are now set on coming for putin until he's strung up in front of the world to see.
He been hate the world with full of guilts…
Pooty-poot is clearing out the deepstate.  Get r done.
No conditions should be met.. this is perhaps Putin’s way of exiting this war without a loss any conditions would be considered a win for Putin and that should not be allowed as Ukraine would still end up under the thumb of Russia
I want NATO out of romania
SURRENDER NOW UKRAINE NOW ! DONT DO THIS TO YOUR OWN PEOPLE IT IS NOT A COMPUTER GAME !  MR GAME BOY OF UKRAINE .
we cannot trust Russia and Putin.,
I’m lost so Ukraine shld stop fighting to defend themselves even wen they are being attracted just to end the war!🤔😒
I love Putin
Why did she get a degree then! 🤦 repetition at it's best to prove a point
United States and its EU prostitutes dont even care if there are civilians when they launch their attacks
Sounds like a crock of shit to me.
Putin is a psycho and can never be trusted again.
Unacceptable , how, and why Putin  you  decided to set condition to end the war in Ukurine  Listen to me now mr  Putin    you  are now history   you hsve no more card to play  a done you done dam   shame,  Death await you in Satan Hell if  you dont change course and go back to Russia.
What idiotic demands from a old man suffering from senile dementia!
People like Putin think there gonna live forever
putin won already. he has possession of most of the country and showed the world he a bada$$
You don't set conditions...you will be losing....the rope is for you...
So what exactly are his demands?
Ing guinu nang bahala kekayu amen.
Erdogan Trying to be smart and follow what Israel has done....
I'm here by sanctioning Russia leader...no more fine ladies around him....if the war continues from tomorrow we are going to stop him from visiting his other room and we are going to take his wife away from him!!!!!. No more Tori Tori for Russia leader
Putin is an idiot and a liar so his demands are that of a War Monger and he doesn't even care about his people because they suffer the most.  You will keep giving in and putin will keep pushing.
Puttin don’t even know wat to say sitting on his hands since they holding his feet to his flame  PUTTIN LOSING BADLY UR WEAPONS LOGISTICS N FOOD IS TRASH
What does Erdogan care ? Not his business
so basicly same shit that caused all this in the first place. Waste of time.
WOWW GRAPE  SO what are the Demands?  Find that out now by scrolling through the comment section 😂
It would be a great opportunity to handcuff him right there as a war criminal.
What are the fucking demands?
To the people who are targeting the reporter: Even Erdogan doesn't know what is exactly meant by 'Moscow's demands' 🤣only Putin knows✌️
I hope Putin at least got Bandera Left overs Neo Nazis, nothing against rest of Ukraine... BUT those are some weird Swastika Worshipping psychos
What demands does he wants after all what he has done already started a war on a peaceful sovereign nation? Many innocent civilians lives lost including his own soldiers on this unnecessary war.
I guess nobody considers the fact that this guy has killed many children and we as the United States are not doing anything about it 😲😡🙊🙈🙉
Spel bias...... W. I. O. N. 😁
LMFAO yeah there is only one condition and that's to be under Russia's ruling again to build the empire. FU PUTIN AND MOSCOW. If anyone doesn't believe this is what they want, than you are F#@KED in the head too.........
Would you agree with those conditions in their place, India? If yes, please get rid of any defense you have. Because some psycho says so. Is like thieves complaining of people having locks on the door of their private homes.
This evil Putin and his followers should be punished seriously for their bloody crimes in Ukraine.
Ukraine must hand over the key to every city, state and province and Zelensky must either report to Putin in Russia or exile himself from Ukraine. What kind a world are we living in ?
Russia could not be trusted to even have a brief ceasefire.
All of this human suffering on both sides could have been avoided if the US, Ukraine etc., had abided by the Minsk agreements they signed. The Minsk agreements were designed to stop the bloodshed in eastern Ukraine and retain the territorial integrity of Ukraine while granting a measure of autonomy to Luhansk and  Donetsk. A very reasonable compromise but the corporate-controlled US Empire never settles for peaceful coexistence. They killed JFK because he was opting for peaceful coexistence with the USSR. Empires never settle for anything less than total ownership and control of the world's natural, human and financial financial resources. Empires depend on their 24/7 media brainwashing, fear-mongering, hate-mongering, etc. Relentless US empire-building agenda, with 800+ military installations in 145+ countries, so far. This makes it the main instigator of wars and terrorism worldwide. This makes it everyone's problem.  The world must fight back against corporate-controlled US Empire!
Go go PUTIN! 👊👊👊👊💪💪💪💪
Putin can't be trusted ... An autocrat can only play you at best
🙏🙏🙏
No Putin demand shall be met. All Putin says is false, specially his untrue offers. A psichopath has no regard for honoring an agreement. No agreement with a criminal. Fire and steel is the response to Putin´s threats.
There is more to this Russia's invasion, I guess.
It's amazing how when power is given to the wrong person, the whole world becomes at risk because of that one person. Putin wants power more than peace. The West must focus on revealing the truth to the deceived Russians. ONLY they can bring Putin to his knees. Where is the COURAGE of the Russian people and soldiers??
....still am praying every second every minute.....P♦E♦A♦C♦ E ... PEACE...PEACE on both sides ....we only live once😔
So all they had to do was say no, we will not join NATO after all, like we all knew already. Got it makes cense, Ukraine rather kill its own people than simply say no to NATO.
Since ww2 ??? Really? I see you forgoten Balkan. You didnt "care" then soo much as today!!!
In time over throw Putin or coup or pariliment in prayer of  mystery of Jesus in his timing of revenge to Putin if Putin and pariliment don't stop demands and get it right.
The world should keep reminding Russia of  the Budapest Memo Agmt signed. It simply cannot use any other excuses to invade Ukraine.  Someone should tell Putin Ukrainians hate him & do not want to be part of Russia.
A pair of scumbags, ignore them both.
Putin is the same as a Nazi. Same evil.
He’s a laughing stock.
Ukraine didn't give Russia the respect they command and got to  mouthy  and  disrespect  putin  as if he's a nobody  thinking the  nato alliance will protect them.every one knows nato won't except Ukraine and Russia needed to make sure it wasn't going to happen. Ukraine will be more diplomatic now when dealing with Russia  and tread more carefully
I bet 99% of ppl listening to this story to hear Putin’s demand was Ukrainians…Lol!🥴🥴
He had an hour and 45 minute conversation with Macron not long ago - testing the waters on many fronts - tread lightly.
He started it, Ukraine will end it. He better pull his troops out, and everything comes back to normalcy.  But he must pay for rebuilding Ukraine. The javelin and stingers are giving him sleepless nights for the loss coming to his bloody hands. And wait till Ukraine gets thousands of them as tactical Ukranian fighters are being trained and equipped by NATO.  His boys in Ukraine will be loaded in body bags via trains to Moscow.  He has a choice to protract the war, or pull out of Ukraine.  The Ukranian resiliency is unmatched over a long time. Putin can bomb buildings.  But not the spirit of the Ukrainian people.
Lmao I literally learned nothing from this
Ukrain be kind to your people and stop the fighting. I regard you as peace loving nation to walk away from trouble when you can. Save what is left of your nation.
Somehow stop the war
What are Moscow’s demands?
Hasn't gone according to plan. Ukraine making Putin look like a grandiose idiot 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣. The prick should be held accountable for WAR CRIMES 🖕
He couldn't invade shit
All these videos are mainly trash. Always read the comments first before viewing. This video is not worth your time.
Unless heavily burden tax payer monies United Nation organisation and it's secretary general cannot hold peaceful resolution with Russia to stop fighting in Ukraine instead  a third party like  turkey , can do the job better.  What is the use of United Nations nowadays since the admission of Evil CCP gangster regime as permanent member into The UNSC supported by the  previous dumb ass  USA President Jimmy Carter .

This is a joke! Russia already violated its Budapest agmt when agreed to respect Ukraine's sovereignty when Ukraine gave up its nuclear weapons.  Would you trust Russia who violated its agmt? Never again!!!
Let see...
This WION is hot garbage - and just russian trolls in "newscast" format
Obviously a fight stops only when the one’s demands are met..but I thought this news would describe the situation/demands
Putin is the new Hitler and the Russians Nazis.
Looks like WION mastered the art of clickbait. lol
Do not surrender!!  Ukraine has every right to defend itself.  Putin would once again break his agreement and take complete control of Ukraine.   Putin demands are 🤮
So what demands,plus ukraine stop fighting,but isnt it russia thats doing the fighting ukraine are just protecting 🤔  if russia stops ukraine stop simple.
Whats left of Ukraine will be forced to join NATO. Poo stain will only be back for more. Taiwan better be battening down the hatches.
Cease fire!!!!!!!!!!!! N
U have not made clear - wat demands?
🤒there was also a peace agreement in 2 States for evacuation and putin also didn't hold onto that.
If Ukraine stops fighting?  Russia is the aggressor and in Ukraine,  so if Russia leaves there'll be nobody to fight.
Two dictators together there ! Sultan Erdogen and Putin ! What a horrible sight to behold !
Clicbait !!
Cease fire. God will win , he always does. Not dictators! Peace ☮️☮️☮️☮️☮️☮️🕊️ to STOP 🛑🛑🛑🛑 think of the children 🙏, 🐥🍼 babies in Urkraine.prayers churches. This is war not peace ☮️☮️☮️🕊️. We need stability and God ,our protected and defense. God's will that we  cease fire. God will cause revenge in his time and timing
That was an exhaustive list of demands!
So nothing new since before the invasion. I will stop when my demands are met. Thats not how negotiation works buddy.
But why would they ceasefire if they're the the ones in they're county killing ppl..they should simply just leave, but we all know that's going to happen
You did not tell us so what are Russia's demands other than Ukraine has to stop fighting
Putin also said that he wasn't going to invade ...   So will he keep his promise this time if Ukraine stops fighting??! 🤷🧐🤠🧐
Erdogan is in nato but secreatlly is with Russia&China wath a dude
Wow! Someone is playing and have the audacity to demand in someone else’s country. Pure EVIL!
THE WAR IN OVER RUSSIAN USING OLD TECHNOLOGY BUT UKRAINE MILITARY USING ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY WEAPON FROM AMERICA TO BRITISH AND GERMANY ARM
If they first stop their fighting? You are the invaders! Get out and the fighting will stop crazy a**! Omg! Am I the only one that thinks every thing he says is b.s.?
Ukraine should stop fighting first after Russia pulls back first (out of Ukraine). Putin likes to use word play. Fair is fair.
It's hardly an acceptable deal on the table is it! Surrender or we continue.
Why trust a psychopath and proven liar?
Zelensky should Demand Russia Rebuild their Country.Why can Putin Demand.Also Don't Trust Putin he is just Clever so Sanctions can be Lifted.There is a Huge Trap.Zelensky should ask Biden to Hold Sanction against Russia for Next 3 Months.
So What are Putin's Conditions ?
End that dumbass war it's not worth the people dien on both sides and that gas pump getting to high!
Putin has atleast understood that it's hurting a lot his own country than to Ukrain.  Economy had fallen drastically. And I don't think so it'll revive any soon. It seems that Putin's own people has  forced him to get back. Russia is going down. It knows well that even after ( whether Russia wins Ukraine or  give up) this war, Russia is going to meet the fate. It'll be cut completely from the rest of the world. It's not the deadly and nuclear weapons that keep a country prosper, , it's economy that does. . And now, Putin has finally pushed it back. Atleast he has to respond to his own people now. On the other side, ukrain, will get more support, more sympathy and more help. It'll revive quickly. . Conclusive, it's Russia who'll have to suffer. Last episode of destruction was from Ukrainian side, , now, Russia will play the rest and for loooooog. . .
Don't believe him...he will say do kill anyone. His destructive  conduct has overwhelmed all .
Poop-Tin💩💩 : " My new demand is Ukrainians cannot defend their homeland from Russian troop invasion, they posed huge threat to my soldiers, little green men and little red men inside Ukraine; in addition to all other previous demands in my past talk with EU leaders. "
Totally click bait by not telling us the details of his demands. Just made yourself a less creditable source.
So no change whatsoever.  Russia will not give up.  These sanxtions are not enough.  The west does not want a ww3 but we are already in it.
All bets will be off if this escalates out of control. The governments should be fighting each other not abusing people. The possibility of miscalculation is great. Prayers for the people freezing and starving over this
THE GAME OVER RUSSIAN WAR IN UKRAINE SURRENDERED TO UKRAINE MILITARY
You DESTROY the peace full country allredy end still you have not stop wish country your going to take over now idont think you can sleep at night you have to most blood jour hands.
Putin is a good guy
Russia... We (asia) are with you.from Bangladesh..
His demands are unreasonable, and Ukraine 🇺🇦 should tell him to shuv it up his tunnel 🙄
So what are the demands? Anyone, as the wion channel didn't say.
Legalized, crook thugs dont stop. I wonder if all this, sadly, is a ruse so China can invade Taiwan.  Politicians murder for less. Just ask this legalized, crook thug.
Deal @ fantom putin.... Shame to
You told us NOTHING. Worthless info. Bravo. Well done.
Just a click bait headline, nothing specific given. SMH.
Cease fire and may God speak straight to Putin and pariliment, we pray 🙏 stop, stop, 🛑 🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑. Prayers of God to listen 👂 to the Lord,God, not a dictator. God reigns by his throne in heaven. Peace ✌️✌️✌️✌️✌️✌️✌️🕊️ prayers to stop 🛑🛑🛑🛑. I think God is talking, we pray 🙏🙏🕊️
BIG LIST for sure ! let me guess , one of them is to take all non NATO countries by peace ? if not let's threaten the whole world again with nuclear weapons.
To get any details about infamous and mysterious demands, we must download the app ? How stupid!
What conditions ?   Lovely news production
Ukraine should not join Nato , that's the only way this war will end
news  lady is hot  only reason i clicked 😊
Go play yourself Putin.  Maybe you and Trump need to continue caressing each other's egotistically maniac behaviour.  You're the best in the world when it comes to BS.
Putin's people will soon turn on him
Well no ship that's what it would take for a cease fire.  This isn't news, it's stupid.  If you want to do a video inform us of what the demands are.  To create a cease fire in any war, one side wants it's demands met.  I feel like I wasted my time clicking on this and then to waste even more time you repeat the non news a second time.   WION what is wrong with you???
The demand of Ukraine to stop fighting is laughable, at best. The only reason they are fighting is because Russia invaded the country to begin with. Also of note is that there was supposed to be a cease fire to evacuate civilians and Russia did not honor that either. So there have already been 2 pretty significant cases where Ukraine wasn't fighting and Russia went ahead with attacking them anyway.
Condition should be Putin should be given a wig. What kind of guy is this Putin
What are moscows demands?
Putin is afraid when Ukraine will become a NATO member. Because, US, NATO, & other allies have its power to build their Military Camp & related military exercises in Ukraine. In that sense, Putin thinks that if It would happen, opponents against Rissia have an easier avenue to defeat Russia.  Ukraine is a Country. Don't deprive the rights over Ukraine.  Putin should mind his own business.
There wouldn't be a need for NATO if Russia would just get rid of its old authoritarian guard . They could have had such a good relationship with Ukraine with free trade and travel and just a friendly open relationship,  but the old cold war mindset on both sides will not go away . All of this is just pushing people farther away from each other .
💟💟💟💟💟💟💟💟💟💟❣❣💟💟💟💟💟💟💟Pray  for Ukraina. 💟💟💟💟💟 💟💟💟💟💟💟💟💟💌💌💌💌💌💟💟
The Russians, have taken a barbaric path of WAR (Murder & Theft), a WAR Crime. The World must Crush these Criminals before this Escalates!  Ukrainians never Surrender,  Destroy any Predatory Tyrannical Dictator, Макіс arise! Live for Liberty, Fight for Freedom, Pray for Peace!
Yeah, ceasefire as they say. Ukraine will cease but Russia will fire!! No to war!!!
My favorite holiday destination is Moscow.    Zelensky
He knows the longer this invasion goes on his country starves and will collapse from within, he'll be overthrown or killed, so he shows strength as a bluff. He cannot sustain the sanctions, their stock market stayed closed in fear of it plummeting, the oligarchs' belongings are being confiscated, the ruble's value has dropped, and it will only worsen. And who's responsible for the damages to the country of Ukraine and the unnecessary deaths as a result of this illegal invasion? Who is going to pay to rebuild all that was destroyed, pillaged, women raped, people killed, cars & personal property stolen/lost/damaged/or destroyed? Who? Putin you are a piece of $hit!
Putin is a fox and China is a little fox. You don't know why China aggression towards India last year, because to order weapons from Russia which was induced by Putin. Rajnath singh visited twice to Russia and ordered 700 crore weapons. Now India is totally locked with Russia for these reasons. Because of these reasons only India supported Russia in UN council. The war planes supplied by russia were without stealth technology. Many war planes supplied by Russia were crashed during training itself. You might have known through newspaper many times.
As long as NATO arms are sneaking inn The Russians Got Big Fight On His BEAR PAWS. GO UKRAINE ,BEAR GO HOME ....BROKEN
Your accent is near impossible to listen to. Baaaaabababaaaaababaababaaaaa. Aaaahhhhhh!😖😖😖😖
Mr Putin must understand that ceasefire of arms should be made simultaneously. Aggressor cannot dictate terms of Cease-fire in his own way to a Soverignty without any specific grounds. Every sovereignty will try to save her motherland from any outward aggression. Ukrainian are not terrorist. They are proud & respective citizens like every other Sovereignty. It is ones born right to save every citizens to resist from any outward aggression.
You LITERALLY just read the title
This news release is honestly sh!t...just lost a subscriber 😒
after he destroyed the country, after he reduced it to rubbles?this man is sick
You mean Putin the most hated president in the world
President Putin is trying to end the madness but US/UK owned and controlled NATO won’t go along with that when it simply wants to murder him with a drone...
If his demands are met? He has some nerve especially after breaking the cease-fire and the indiscriminate shelling of civilians. Putin is losing his ass and he knows it. He picked a fight with the wrong country, the wrong people and the wrong President. Putin should be removed from office and put in one of those cozy little gulag cells in Siberia he is so fond of
Don’t trust communist.
I don’t understand! if Ukraine stops fighting and if Russia demands are met?
What's with the damn repeats? So annoying.
Crap report .. already saw the same report from reputable sources
Befor watching this complete I read first comment and decided to take a step backward
lady , you said nothing in 7 different ways go home and watch real news somewhere  else
There is only one man in NATO who can handle Putin ...that is ERDOGAN....b'coz of Turkish weapons Russia is facing heavy losses....Putin has taken BIDEN;  MICRON; BORIS for time pass as jokers
My God, this perhaps for the first time, wion is telling the same thing in different ways and not telling the main news... Please don't become like yet another channel
this channel is looking more and more like a sensationalist non-news feuilleton.
What are these mysterious demands?  And the defending party is supposed to stop fighting first?  He's just saying "Hold still so I can kill you."  I wouldn't go for that.  Nobody would.  Slava Ukraine.
Stop the war
Way to end conflict and save lives 👉 Zelenskyy & Putin engage in debate, or sword fight.
If Ukraine stay in Neutral not yett to join NATO, this war can't be happen. Both country waste they Resources and Souls. just hope this war end...
No ones fault ,it"s conscience anf freedom of choice, ,why adapt to a dictatoship ruled govt??
Still didn’t hear his demands
this was stupid she didn't say shit.
If NATO  is serious about world peace,  they should invite Russia to join them instead of isolating the country.  Russia can obviously contribute a lot to Eastern European defense of NATO.  Where is the trust?
You guys in India sill backing Russia ???????...well stop ....join your brothers in the UK. Russia cannot be trusted under Putin   Putin's demands. Simple he wants to control the whole of Europe. It isn't happening !!!!!!!!
Hilarious that Erdogan is supplying drones to Ukraine that are killing Russian troops and has also shut off the Bosporus Straight to Russian warships yet Putin is willing to meet him to discus demands. These two clowns are too stupid to run anything.
These West/Americans will never change their minset towards Russia because it's their natural enemy engraved in their heads by their great great grandparents.....  So guys stop wasting your time trying to convince pig to fly Let our leaders do the talking.
Whatte reporting lol
Your are the most evil in the world.putin God give you a super punishment.
2 minutes where the reporter doesn't mention anything about Putin's conditions. What a load of crock
Uhhh - what are those demands you’re mentioning? A re-cap in this story would be good.
Seriously NATO should be dismantled immediately as Warsaw Pact was dissolved believing West. Worldwide protest should be made to dismantle NATO which is not safe for humanity.  Can the crooked and cunning West will dismantle NATO? Even if they are not willing the whole world should force west to dismantle NATO for a better future to our children’s to have a peaceful harmonized life.
America should protect their friends against enemies (the aggressor)  Forieign and Domestic!  It effects the freedom, safety, and stability of all mankind!
dont hear clown
What happened to her? Looks like they got to her as well smh
Hes a bully
Ukraine has his own right to be NATO member at anytime, none of Russia's business. How can a rat would listen to a crazy Tiger?
Please stop this war it’s not good for both side. May we live in peaceful and freedom. We all will die no matter what !!!🇺🇦🙏🙏
Evil is as evil does. Every country in the civilised world must come together to denounce this coward who hides away in Moscow yet sends his men to fight for a battle that has been mis-sold to them. They are being lied to.
Ukraine should know when they are beaten.
2 bankrupt losers trying to save face.  If you are Ukraine, then I'd nuke up after it all settles. This showed nato is weak and can't be relied on. Ukraine needs to go like South Korea and build a killing zone as a border.  The US played it well.  The US can't wipe out Putin directly because if it does, all the countries will whine about it.  The USSR imploded  because it went broke.  Same is happening. Russia is becoming a North Korea except it has oil.
He isn’t in a position to make demands . His military are incurring huge losses . His conscript soldiers are not interested and they are loosing a lot of ordinance . When the last Ukrainian citizen surrender a he can maybe make such a comment , but he’ll need 1 million Russian soldiers to occupy Ukraine . Even if there is a surrender and insurgency will begin . The mothers of Russian need to understand they will be burying their sons for decades . It’ll only end when the elite I. Russia realise this man is a tyrant and remove him by arrest or a bullet .
The hell is Nato
President Putin is right, so, his conditions must be met. He is the rightful world authority to command respect and to demand that his agenda is set forth. He is the rightful authority and no one can take that away from him. He is God's appointed and anointed warrior, he has the superior power to set the conditions.  It is better for the US_European alliance to accept this and embrace him because the alternative is catastrophic for the global community.
Sounds like unconstitutional surrender to me.
Call or put?
Foolish president and his few foolish people spoiled this heavenly place.
Moscows demand are that all countries who are part of NATO after 1997 be moved out of NATO . Im not sure after such behavior by russia those countries will be convinced to move out. Even russia has weakened a lot it is just a matter of days when Moscow will fall or Moscow will completely annihilate ukraine
His demands are a limb-lengthening surgery and krispy kreme donuts
I swear lady anchors in this channel are so incompetent in their job, she said a lot but nothing 🤔🤔🤔, why don’t you explain the demands
I say pretend like we are agreeing with Putin, stop him from causing more damage, and when the dust settles, Putin is kidnapped and put on trial for war crimes.
Don't stop. Remove Ukraine for the map. Russia
um so what are Russians demands?
Rip Putin and go to the hell
How anyone can take this garbage “news” channel seriously is disturbing!
putin LIED about conditions when LIED about ceasefire, he & his gov people & his military & family ALL under fire of Holy Spirit, heavy judgment.
Leaders of nations are saying you never back a rabid animal into a corner, you have to give them a way out. What way will that be and at what cost to that region and the world?!
It’s a dream
Interesting development.. Since Turkey and Russia are actually on different sides of the Syrian conflict…
What are the demands?
ok,,,,are you related to chuckies bride Jen Psaki? you said a whole lot of nothing
Who are you to make demands, Putin? Currently, you are not winning the war and you have succeeded in turning the whole world against you. Your economy is tanking and it is only a matter of time before your own people turn against you.
There is nothing but money behind this and I believe it involves Joe Biden and Hunter. Trump ALWAYS kept Putin in check by never letting him fill his bank account with oil money... but on day 1- Biden gives Putin exactly what he wants?  This was no accident. Biden has never been right in policy for 50 years, so Bidens belief that Putin thinks in western terms gave Putin free reign.  As soon as Ukraine begged Biden for what they needed and he refuseD-- PUTIN KNEW HE WON- AND NOW WILL DO WHATEVER HE WANTS. LETS GO BRANDON!
Worst news channel in the world
It is USA the culprit in 🇮🇶Iraq, 🇱🇾Libya, 🇸🇾Syria, 🇾🇪Yemen, 🇦🇫Afghanistan, 🇻🇳Vietnam, 🇯🇵Japan, etc. and now 🇺🇦Ukraine.
Putins has been asking Ukrainie forc8 yeras...to start peace talks...but noo...because Usa was giving us weapons....so later we would be destroying each other
Ukraine, surrender!!!
Путин не Россия! Все русские - это Россия! Русские люди добрые, миролюбивые и очень умные. Русский народ выходит на улицу! Идите все протестовать! Объединитесь, чтобы положить конец этой манипуляции и остановить войну! Не участвуйте в этой резне/преступлении человечества! Путин не может арестовать и наказать всю свою страну, потому что ВЫ - СТРАНА! Ты Россия!
Jesus she said the same thing over and over. No detail of demands. Thanks for the information 🙄
so what are the demands? new channel that fails to report the news.
Ahh click bait i see
Putin: Give me everything and we will stop
What are fckin demands?? Tell that too
Demands are met?  Sounds like a random to me!
There is nothing but money behinds this and I believe it involves Joe Biden and Hunter. Trump ALWAYS kept Putin in check by never letting him fill his bank account with oil money... but on day 1- Biden gives Putin exactly what he wants?  This was no accident.

wtf is this get your news channel sorted this told us nothing ??
Let Russia fall. Japan should have some advice for putin. America is strong. Only our kids are weak pacifist. Put me in coach I'm ready to play. Again
The news presenter is hot.
OMG
Nonsense news
What are the demands being asked by the mad man? Supposed he ceasefire, what about those he put in graves?
The Only Condition is get out of Ukraine and give yourself up so you can be judged for war crimes☠️ !
this report was an SNL skit, right
What are the demands?? Enlighten that too....
Dont trust him!
It is USA the culprit in 🇮🇶Iraq, 🇱🇾Libya, 🇸🇾Syria, 🇾🇪Yemen, 🇦🇫Afghanistan, 🇻🇳Vietnam, 🇯🇵Japan, etc. and now 🇺🇦Ukraine.
They don’t want to mention it’s NATO that is the problem and Russia has complained for years and has been completely ignored
This is another strategy for Russia to hit Ukrainian unaware. Another deceit from Putin
Thanks a lot to Mr president ERDOĞAN 🇹🇷  for convince PUTIN 🇷🇺                        💙❤💙❤💙❤
So without even being said we all know his condition to end this is going to be We will stop the invasion BUT you admit defeat and then step aside to allow Putin and Russia to have their way with the Ukraine. So basically Russia will stop this unprovoked attack that most of the world agrees that they’re the villains for initiating...They will stop this attack if they get “own” Ukraine afterwards...wtf!?...if I was the countries surrounding Ukraine and or Russia I’d go head and start gettin my shit together to join and help Ukraine or at least preparing to be the next victim
lol... WION shouldn't be doing a clickbait like wtf
The demands are ridiculous.  To demilitirize?  So Russia can invade again whenever it wants?
Putin  is such a classic, malignant NARCISSIST! He is thoroughly entitled, attention seeking and paranoid while throwing a tantrum and will stop only if he gets what he wants right now! He has zero empathy and negotiation is a sign of weakness and defeat to him.  The only way to stop him &/or to  defeat him is for the rest of the world to stop enabling his demands , NOT tolerate his threats and  join forces with Ukraine. SHAME  on Putin. He is sich a medical misfit to be a leader.
Erdogan finds Russias invasion...unacceptable? Erdogan...seriously??? What has he to say about Kurdistan?
Hoew many times are u going to say Russia demands what are the demands are they the same ..lol if Russia demands
Just drop billion bombs in Moscow
Turkey talking about is invasion in Syria, uh nope, of course, I can do what I want but not you...
No joining Nato.  Regime change and be slave to Russia forever and ever
They won't because the conditions are reasonable as against continuing the war and they (US and NATO) don't want to meet them.  The conditions of invasion of France in Francophone countries is worse yet nothing has been done about them.  End this war. Withdraw NATO. Ukraine need to make so life saving selfish decisions than trying to impress NATO.
Putin - short guy syndrome
he knows ukraine can not be taken easy i hope they dont agree fight on
The world should hold Russia accountable for what it’s done
What are the demands?
What does war bring? Do you think war can make peace? People getting killed won't make any difference for both the nations. All the world must act as united and support so that peace can be gained and the innocents don't have to be brutally killed like this. The whole world is now like a monopoly game thinking of only how to manipulate the weak and smartly loot all the resources of the poor by deceiving the minds of the world as if nothing wrong has been done
His demands are: give up, be my slaves, he constantly repeating that Ukraine is Russia, and there for saying Ukraine should not exist. NATO is useless! If they think Putin will stop at Ukraine, they being delusional. Baltic countries will be next, then Poland. His plans are obvious, he wants to bring back USSR.
After taking lives..such an anim*l
What ?😒
Putin…………I’ll stop 🛑 killing yours….. when you stop 🛑 resisting !!!!!!!  Good deal….. take it or leave it.   😘
Why should any one believe him , he invaded  Ukrainian when he said he had no intention of doing so , then threatens the west with nukes if they intervene,  what dose he want stop sanctions,  no more countries  add to nato , he has showed his true colours he is not to be trusted at any cost , he needs to be accountable for his action's. We'll done Ukrainians  for standing up to tyrant bullie you have my utter respect.
But there not going to give up Ukraine. I wonder what's going to happen after Russia has Ukraine 100%, it will happen. Then what. If they keep the sanctions Russia will have nothing to lose but to keep going. And then maybe China will start with Taiwan, since they what happened in Ukraine. And China will think how long can the U. S. Economy together. This has been planned for a long time. They say sleepy Joe and said this is the time for us.
PUTIN THE RIGHT HAND OF THE DEMON
You NEVER spoke about the CONDITIONS that Putin DEMANDS---EVEN during war times News outlets do CLICK BAIT VIDEOS---TERRIBLE VIDEO
Little Napoleon is no position to dictate terms.
Putin has committed war crimes targeting civilians and using vaccuum bombs and targeting nuclear power plants and probably many other crimes.. he should be done like Sadam Hussain for his actions
I don't  think  we should  trust any word which comes from Putin  mouth he lied before and he has caused damages already no let him face the sanctions  .
U.N.should setup no fly zone
❤❤
Putin and his goons should be trialed for crimes against humanity and waging war.
Masha-Allah se edrogan lang pala ang pakikingan se putin.
Putin is a life long professional criminal and murderer! He will not escape Karma!!!
Well what are their demands?
Does the United Nations have any moral authority left anymore to say anything? A defunct organization that should be disbanded at the earliest.
💪🇷🇺❤️
This anchor can slow down and try to pronounce the words properly. She's messing up even the simple words
The headline is certainly misleading.  What demands?  What conditions?  A grammar school student could cover a story better.
Breaking news but no mention of what the conditions are Moscow is demanding.  Worthless wannabe press.
"my demand is to win the war to stop the war"... Wow, that's suprise... Now guess what are demands of Ukraine side...
Turkey has no legs to stand when half of Cyprus is occupied illegally by them.
It's amazing when you watch media like this how they never mention the one most effective way to end the war in Ukraine is for countries like the US to stop funding the war against  Ukraine from buying Russian oil.💲💲   Nothing really to see here folks just another manufactured and organized World War. AND the media doing what they do best especially towards the weak minded who can't even realize they've seen this so many times before.
​ @Matt Cannon  Wow,,. NO one  since WW2 has threatened to invade or even contemplated to invade Russia. Nato wants NOTHING from them except to live in peace. Mexico inviting a hostile China into it's territory on the U.S. border is very different.  You know as well as The whole world knows that no one wants to invade Russia. Countries want to join Nato because Russia is an aggressor. Finland, Poland, The Baltic States, Ukraine, Rumania, Moldova have all been invaded by and subjugated under Russia's control as many other Eastern European countries were also. If Russia would put down there weapons. Peace would break out and no one would bother them.
Russia cant be trusted
His demands is worst than the honorable death...........
If Ukraine stops fighting???  Hahahahahah good luck with that. Ukrainians would rather die than surrender.
Worthless YouTube video, what are the demands? you never tell us
Only poor Ukraine that always wanted to leave Ukraine  and also refugee are the one that are coming to other countries you all so blind damm pffffff
Conditions are met? How is this a news report.
Putin the barbarian
Thats turkish bullship,trying to get in the game and help putin forcing his demands.
putin talks with world leaders ..not joe biden
Wion: Putin will stop fighting if Russia's demands are met and those...demands...ARE... -> *Insert massive CLIFFHANGER*
Putin is not interested on stop fighting and killing until he controls Ukraine 🇺🇦 💯,,,, talks talks Putin, is making world leaders chase wild goose while he have he’s own agenda in play !!!!
Screw Putin.
Putin is an obvious liar. Putin says Ukraine is making a dirty bomb, which means HE is building one or has one ready to use, probably when he starts loosing. Only fools listen to sociopaths. He fired on civilians leaving through an escape corridor.
Moscow's demands are met.  Translation, put down your guns and accept a puppet president that answers to Moscow only.
Demands? free ice cream and a free subscription to Porn Hub?
That’s because he is losing and it’s costing him dearly
Never negotiate with terrorists. They are not in the position to negotiate the ending of something they started. Let them deal with sanctions until the end of the year regardless if say they pull out tomorrow. The innocent lives they stole is worth a lot more and honestly should be cut off for years or indefinitely so they know never to do it again.
I hope this can be resolved but Im american, but im siding with China on this one , i am ashamed of how things are playing out, we need to invest more in being able to stop these things from happening, like weaponizing satillights or something,
We should  except  PUTIN  demands
Cool story. What are the demands lol.....Russia will leave when Ukraine finds the Iraqi WMD's.
...And the conditions are??? Terrible news piece.
Spit in his face and dare him to hit the button. He has to know, with the power of NATO, if he hits that button, he may destroy other countries, but Russia will cease to exist and others will surely survive. So much for the motherland. I’d rather die standing up for what is right and just than bow down to a mad man who’s only enjoyment in life is total subjugation of the weak, country, after country.
What where the demand?
There really isn't anything new in this video that Putin hasn't said before but considering how stupid the Western public is being due to all the brainwashing it's worth repeating anyway
Repeating some phrases again AMD again without telling about the thumb nail of the video. Journalism at its best 😂
click bit .... report shit video
Ok what are the demands?
The only condition is unconditional  surrender of all russian forces
More B/S this site is full of it.
According to a report of all social media networks in the US. India ranks number one while China ranks #2 in posts showing supports for Russia and its invasion of Ukraine. Western companies now should consider whether or not they should continue to move their operations from China to India, and/or invest in India. They don't want to get stab on the back a 2nd time.
Has the ugly  monster realised he has bitten off more than he can chew?
Props for Turkey to help negotiate the peace.   When your neighbors are fighting it only causes unrest in your neighborhood.
And what are those demands???
Melissa is a man
Demand 1, Ukraine unconditional surrender 2, The world all tell Mr Putin they are not angry with him. 3, NATO is disbanded permanently 4, The Banana.Splits are rerun on a Saturday morning.
Why don’t we dictate to him what he needs to do or he will be dead before sunrise
Nobody likes tom
0:39 Putin is weak
,l,, you putin
The first country who pulled the trigger should be the first country to stop fighting. Demands? What demands???
To late ur guilty of mass murder..
The peace talks are not a dialog but a monolog!!!!
What are Moscow's demands?
What are the conditions?? Wat r the demands. Why dont u reveal imp point.
Zelensky is only following US Leftists....Ukraine won't stop...not the Azov nazi's
Ukraine can't fight God. God sees what UK, and the West is up to.
Bullshit
So wtfs the conditions u kept saying the same shit
why even wast anyone time with this story.  Why doesn't  India show the world and do what China want India to do or other wise get your heard out of your butt
What but Russia started it and went into that country. How about Russia stops first.
"I will not rob you, if you give me your money."
Sadly for Putin I think he’s made a mistake and has little way out. The only way this war is going to end is when Putins dead or overthrown. He’s crossed the line he can’t come back from.
Meeting Putin's demands means Russia winning the war without the war.
Ukraine is not fighting, they are defending only. Moscow doesn't know what their demands are.
We don't deal with criminals!
So who’s gonna trust a man who tricked his own army into fighting his war?
And the conditions are..............
this is CLICK BAIT.  Moscow's demands met was said 5 times never say what they are...NOT THAT WE CARE!
Hopefully realistic!
You're double taking hun  A str8 bun with no beef.
He doesn’t meet any demands but wants his to be met, what a character.
Ukraine  is going  to get better and stronger after the war.  Ukraine  will prevail.  The people and God is on their side
If Ukraine stop fighting what is that mean?
Never  never trust a Russian  especially PUTIN on keeping his word
Maybe they want the corruption to stop in Ukraine. Ask hunter biden about that.
Before the invasion he's conditions landed on deaf ears why would they agree to the conditions after the invasion...their plan is to collapse the current world order financial system and start a new world order digital system!! It's all planned out, something going to trigger WW3...maybe a assassination(a prominent person), then a great nation from the east will rise...
Only ONE CONDITION AS**OLE, GET THE PHUK OUT AND REBUILD THE COUNTRY AT YOUR EXPENSE.
What are the conditions?
Putin lied about just doing war games. His saying if Ukraine stops fighting is just more BS..
The madman has demands? Let the world make demands. For putin's head. If all the troops and military aren't gone out of the Ukraine within 24 hours, then the world ought to attack each and every Russian military base from all sides! And putin's head must roll. Then Russia can pay for what it has done to the Ukraine. Build up the country, they so brutally attacked.
Surprised no hit an is on his way to russia
this is a stupid repeating clip
USA & EU  has failed completely. If it was an African leaders or Asian leaders will they sit & watch this wickedness. FEAR has envelope them. Take this guy out... He his a terrorist. Putin demand is Ukraine should be under him.. What a stupid demand. I better die standing than submit to this demand. Never, it will not happen. Who ever accept this stupid demand is a coward. Putin should be told FACE to FACE that his demand will NOT be MET & His demand is Stupid One.
Attacking
Good about time Putin stops artacking
Who is going to rebuild this beautiful country, and then there’s the next time!
too late , world is already watch everything
Im sorry but i believe that the Ukraine needs to be neutral. They should never be in NATO. There is to much rich Russian history from Ukraine for them to be a part of NATO. By being neutral they arent on either side and if this would happen again with Russia attacking them if they chose to be neutral than NATO should intervene but only if Russia attacked or invaded again after Ukraine agrees to being neutral.
Russia your at war 🤣🤣🤣🤣 and it looks like your losing badly…like Ukraine said get off there land…u are the invader..
right after EU says dont test us.. and what are those demands again...  putin losing yet still making demands. unbelievable... well i do hope for the best though, to end this war.
China 🇨🇳 vs Taiwan next?
How big are putins 🧠 (brains)?  Check between his legs.
Who is erdogan?
Russia your at war 🤣🤣🤣🤣 and it looks like your losing badly…like Ukraine said get off there land…u are the invader..
There’s nothing like one dictator talking to another dictator about establishing peace on earth… I feel so much better about the future of our planet already…
What are the demands? Stop fighting or stop defending oneself? Who started the  fight? Russia must stop fighting.
This was a shit news
For anyone that does not know already. Russian demands are as follow.  1- Total rendition, meaning all ukranians put their weapons on the ground.  2- Government capitulation, Russia will Choose and appoint politicians to replace the current Ukranian administration.  3-Ukraine will be used by Russian military forces, the same way Belarus is, Russia can move freely within their borders withouth any need to Ask for autorization.  4-Recognition of Crimea as being Russian territory (and probably other cities and important regions in the South)  5- Recognition of the Separatists territories as "Real states".   Other demands will be to stay away from NATO and from the West and anyone who opposes Putin´s Regime obviously.
That is the stupidest demand ever.
He forgot one scenario: someone "denazifies" Putin's residence
Putin caused this whole conflict.   An awful human being…….  Possibly the worst person that the World has seen.
Don't forget, a day before Russia Ukraine we didn't trust these stations. Don't believe everything.
Do not join nato or get annihilated
So stop fighting? You first!
Meanwhile Ankara is selling combat drones to Ukraine...
I'll give you some demands, Putin steps down, faces charges of war crimes, Russia goes back home.
Watching that was a waste of time!
Stop fighting? How about stop invading?
Putin also said it was just a military exercise and not an invasion=Lie!!! .We will never be able to trust him again,the Iron Curtain is ascending.
Breaking news, you can buy a car if you have enough money
For those who got absolutely nothing from this report, here are Russia's demands:  - Ukraine must not enter NATO  - Nato must remove any troops or weapons deployed to countries that entered the alliance after 1997, which would include much of eastern Europe, including Poland, the former Soviet countries of Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia, and the Balkan countries.  - NATO cannot hold military drills in those areas without prior consent from Russia  - NATO must agree NOT to get any larger.
Call him what he is..a psycho out of control
We shouldn't forget that NATO exists because of Russia and only Russia. How would you like to have your enemies at your borders, he overreacted by attacking but historically it is the thing to do. When in doubt attack. We can work our way out of this, but we have to consider Russia's position. Maybe we should disband NATO and make a new alliance with Russia included. Isn't that what we want a world where everyone eats at the same table.
ओम शांति ओम 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
How about the rest of the world demands that Russia packs it bags and go home
Putin,  your  conditions  are  not  acceptable.  The  following  conditions  you  WILL  ABIDE  BY.  1)    You  will  withdraw  ALL  of  your  troops  from  Ukraine  and  send  those  still   living  back  to  their  homes  snd  mothers.  2)   Putin,  you  will  pay  all  war  reparations  to  Ukraine  including  the  sum  of  $1,000,000  for  each  Ukrainian  or  fighter  killed  or  wounded  in  your  assault  on  Ukraine.  3)   Putin,  you  will  sign  the  document  yet  to  be  named  stating   you  WILL   NEVER   EVER  AGAIN  even  think  of  more  such  actions  against  any  neighbouring   country.  4)   Putin,  you  will  RESPECT  the  soverienhty  of  all  nations  close  and  far away.  5)   Putin,  you  will  go  back  to  your quarters  and  bag  your  head  never  ever  to  show  your  face  ever bargain.
Are u indian?! The accent is not really clear!!
I blame west for this because is one must know and one day this will be history as well and if we see history west is more culprit then russia.
I don't think Russia could take on anyone and win, they seem to be the weakest country on the planet. His army gets kicked in the ass and all he can do is yell "I will nuke you". Why don't the Russian people just put him down and do the whole world a favor?
Putin is worse than HitLer.
Not gonna happen.
So he will only stop if Ukraine surrenders? Lol sounds reasonable hahaha
Shove those demands up your arse and save us all the trouble and put an end to yourself putin.
World should not negociate with a terr0r1st.  To The Hague!!!!!
"Special Operation" sounds a lot like "Final Solution" ... by that I mean deeper meaning than what anyone might think.
there is prophecy that says that Russia will march through all the nations of Europe ,and that russia would surround Rome and raise their flag there . and that Rome would be purified in blood and that the Pope would be killed .by sister elena aiello .       and Baba Vanga said that Putin would become Lord of the World while Europe will become a wasteland and that nobody can stop Russia .
Russia military is a joke their toy tanks are stuck in mud lmao
What a fucking news same staement repeatidily put on air and not even mentioned what are Moscow's demands
Ura Ukraine. 🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇦🇱🇦🇱🇦🇱🇬🇪🇬🇪🇬🇪
and what are Moscow's demands??
Just remember the world is very small compared to the universe!!!!! The END OF THE WORLD NO ONE KNOW
I hope to God that it will destroy that Capital Russians pay what they did they don't deserve this
It’s not news when you repeat the same thing over and over to fill airtime basically saying nothing!
Very good Putin.     👍👍👍👍👍
The moment Ukraine stop fighting back Russia wins and will take over Ukraine killing all major leaders and assign Russian to be the new leaders.
That "demands" will never match because both are egoistic.. One should be neutral then it'll work.
Can no one stop this man ?? 😡
We have 16000 foreign fighters going into Ukraine, along with the NATO fly boys, and others. First let the SOB get a full meal of that,  then let Ukraine set the conditions, Don't give the killer any sympathy. he needs to be eradicated from the face of the earth, and  it's his time to go after what he has done.
Putin must be running out of money. The oligarchs are putting pressure on him to stop. You only set conditions for peace when you can no longer sustain a prolonged war! Putin erroneously thought he would be greeted with open arms and invited to a chicken Kiev dinner. Instead the people offered him lead sandwich’s. And now he wants peace? Or does he really want to save face?
do not believe Russia . They still drop bomb  at Ukraine even seen fire. who will  do a solution for stop the war… we would like you update news. how about China ….
Russia 🇷🇺 you have lost the war. Surrender now
My condition of not hating putin will only be put to rest when he is no longer.
U came into the country, so who should stop the fight 1st
"Putin halts the invasion if Ukraine stops fighting" words coming out from the aggressor himself.
If putin don't end it, someone else will. Putin is totally isolated from the world.
He didn't envision the full scope of this disaster.  Now he's looking for an out.  We should give it to him.  We really need to come back from the precipices of nuclear holocaust.  NATO is not entirely blameless in this matter.  Pray for peace.
russia wants complete surrender, those are there demands, zelansky will be sent to a siberian labor camp for reeducation. I don't knot know if thats acceptable to zelansky.  Putin also wants to denazify ukraine which is a hopeless demand, there are too many nazi's in ukraine.
Waste of time unless we know what her terms are,mi.e. Ukraine to total surrender. Put in can go to hell.
Only going to get worse. Disarmament is viable. How else is this scenario going to go. Defence is not fighting back.
Refugee crises since WWll? NO, since the invasion and destruction of the Middle East and more coming from Africa!!!
I like this channel for their unbiased reporting. But this clap was clearly below the mark. What are Moscow’s demands ? That piece of crucial information is missing.
Old, weak man cowering behind nukes.
What a waste of time. She didnt say a damn thing that was relevant.
"NATO go were you were before 1997 ,""Why did NATO put their   so called defensive systems in bordering Russia countries ,especially when Soviet Union was no more ,and Warsaw pact was dismantled ,instead of showing good will they showed the opposite ,massing  their forces over last 30 years in countries which should be neutral .Do we want peace ,then let,s make peace supporting choices.
The demands is regularization of Crimea, the desmitalization of Ukraine, the President and the gobern resign (to put a puppet president) and denazification of Ucraine whatever it means, this is a kiddnaping of democrazy
Accept the demands, try Putin for war crimes. Put him in the ground or in prison then join  NATO. Chess not checkers.
All must ended..
Nope don't give in
Here are the demands of the free world.  Immediately cease the murder of Ukranian women and children and begin withdrawal of your army or we order the no flight zone above all of Ukraine airspace - war or no war - your choice Putin.  If we don't do this now, we will face worse later on.
Im telling you these people are out for Putin regardless of anything. I would be protecting the russian people from these evil cock roaches too
Stop WION. Please. This reminds me Ajtak and other news channels. Please don’t be them.
All this comes from NATO & EU Expansion towards Russia borders back in 199, after the Cold War, before Puti's time. Let's speed up to April 3, 2008, NATO'S Final Declaration of Independence Bucharest Summit. "NATO welcomes Ukrainian's and Georgian's Euro Atlantic aspirations for membership in NATO. We agreed today that these countries will be come members of NATO"  Putin's Response to Bucharest Declaration. Georgia and Ukraine becoming part of NATO is a "direct threat" to Russia. This is serious business 14 years in progress. I need USA and NATO to Stand Down before we all get whacked in Babylon.
I doubt that will happen. Let's see if Putin will feel the heat of the sanctions given to him and his country.
WION are you normal🤔 you are starting to get boring
Are you serious??? You are the one attacking. You should stop fighting, not the Ukrainians... Omg 3 IQ president
In other words if Ukraine stops defending itself.   Putin is like a wife beater: it’s your fault I hit you.
Are you reporting on the 18000 fully automatic weapons given to whoever wanted them and now Ukrainians are being murdered in the street by gangs if Ukrainians roaming robbing banks and grocery stores and killing people they thought were Russian Or azov the n e o n a z I s who thanked the world for their new weapons in a video???
Thank you, video clip, for allowing the comment section to elaborate on your title since you yourself were totally useless.
This is proper journalism. Thank you WION. Most of the media houses were captured by the war mongers. This is what the world needs.
hope Putin like these “special economic conditions” 🤷‍♂️🇪🇺
He already abuse his demands…. He can work out his therms with our dead! Specially with relatives of his dead people.
Why is the world so upset of Russia when doing things the US regularly do.
WHAT A DEAL - PUTIN'S WAY OR THE HIGHWAY ! --- SOUNDS LIKE UNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER AND ACCEPT THE DICTATORS TERMS OF SUBMISSION ? - NOTHING LIKE JAPAN OR W. GERMANY AFTER THE WAR.  --- IF PUTIN CAPITULATED - HE WOULD HAVE NO FEAR OF NATO OR FEEL THREATENED ? --- JAPAN DID OK !
What a hash kind of news piece is that? 3 times you repeat that they'll stop if their demands are met and you NEVER specify what the demands are...
Clickbait
Pitin started started the aggression and he's the one demanding?! WTF!!
Putin started this nonsense- no-one can believe a word out of this communist's dictor's  mouth. What audacity !!
Just say no!
This episode is USELESS!!!
Lies and tricks.  Just stop attacking ukraine and problem solved.  Corridor for peacful talkings was always open. It's up to Putin. If Moscow demands are met? What are Moscow's demands besides INVADING UKRAINE?
That clip tells absolutely nothing, joke news plus my clip went silent halfway thru
What conditions ? What kind of reporting is this?
Russia: We will stop fighting if Ukraine gives up.  Bruh what's the point of fighting if Ukraine gives up everyone knows there is no point in fighting if they surrender. It's like saying I will eat when I am hungry. Anyone would only eat when they are hungry no one would keep eating all day.
Another 'demand to be met' might be that Putin stops murdering his political opponents?
WTH, this is not worth the news. You mention demands and then? Journalism is getting worse these days.
Russia invades and wants Ukraine to stop defending itself? How does that work? Shouldnt the invading force stop its invasion first before the country defending itself could stop defending itself? im so confused.
I don't believe anything that mainstream media says they have been lying about covid for 2 years.
why people want keep Ukraine in war with Russia,  Bladimir putting want to end the war.  If both countries want to end this war,  rest the world stop pushing Ukraine.
NATO should immediately begin carpet bombing Russia until Russia pulls all forces out of the historical borders of Ukraine.- TAV ♥️🇺🇸🌎👍
Incomplete news information 😂😂
Slava Ukraini Heroyam Slava Respect and love to all in Ukraine praying for you all every day children, elderly....hardly military targets Russia
What freaking demand???
Moscow demand: 1) Assassination of Zelensky 2) Pro-Putin Ukraine puppet ruler 3) Ukraine will not join NATO
Nato got involved in Afganistan, Lybia Irak, Kosovo and many more, none of these countries are Nato states, yet Nato gets involved, why does it not get involved with Ukrain, this shows that when Nato is faced with an adversy of equal size, it runs scared, pathetic.    what hypocracy, why when Israel invade Palestine, does Nato, not get involved, or when the Saudis bomb Yemen. Disgusting hypocracy and double standards.
What is his demands??? That the Ukrainian people capitulate so he can claim victory??
Suppose you are asked to vote: - that your country should engage in direct military action to protect Ukrainian people from Putin’s assault, at the risk of nuclear war that could kill you - that your country should not take direct military action, beyond providing assistance to Ukraine own defence force, probably giving you less personal risk  What do you do?
Poland has been getting to know Russian politicians for above 80 years and knows them very well, that's why  "History teaches that a democracy without values easily turns into open or disguised totalitarianism"  Pope John Paul II
Do as I say not as I do
WHAT ARE THE GODDAMN DEMANDS
Putin is a cold war dinosaur.  He was trained by the KGB or the K G used to be.  He seems not to understand that the political climate  has changed and no longer supports  the cruel authoritarians.  You can no longer isolate and eliminate people.  Information can not be stopped.  He cannot defeat the smart phone and the internet.  His has declared war on all decent people including his own country.
week-old click-bait...shame on you! 👎🏻 5.3m subscribers...really???
Top story? But not actually tell us the story.  What are the demands?  You said unless the demands are met over 3 times but zero about what that demand is.  You got my click but I will remember that you tend to be useless bait and consider your news suspect.
In brief the three major demands put by Putin to bring the war on Ukraine to an end are: 1. Ukraine must give an assurance of not  joining NATO at any cost. 2. Accepting the sovereignty of Russia on Crimea by Ukrainian Goverenment.  3. Recognition of Donestsk and Luhansk as two  separatist regions in Eastern Ukraine due the their pro-russian ethnicity and culture
Nato expansion will not stop it will expand now to putin aggression I dont say Russian aggression because it is not what Russian wanted to attack Ukraine
You pretty much told us nothing. Every dispute ends if Demands are met.
Wion...have some shame for the click bait ...
jai ho Putin da
Rich make wars to get even richer,  the poor can go to hell. Caring is show off business. Very few world leaders truly care about their own ppl. The leaders of any nation first should think everything about the ppl of its own country. Put ppl even b4 yourself.
Wat r the demands.... Don't repeat too much...
We have zero idea with the Conditions ARE. How about this, Someone take putin o u t!
He used up his conditions already!
I like wion news but this one was click bait.. I’m just waiting for palki sharmas reports
his great demand is he wants to get ukraine and he wants ukranians live in another country <<<---  a condition that the Ukrainians would die for!!!
Indian reporting at it's finest, in other news, we found a new mango lasse recipe.
Sure, Putin has shown how trustworthy he is, especially with his alleged “cease fire” recently.  So, I’m sure if his demands are met, that this will end the conflict. The world has complete confidence in Putin’s word. 🙄
Ok what are the conditions.
Related the freaking dialogue for the whole video … seriously guys get over the need for views and do proper journalism
What r the demands...
Really you new world order people just don't understand what is going on do you, if only you had real journalist tellingly the truth and not what your bosses told you to say
Whhat about Ukraine demands, not just Russian demands.  There is always two side on a coin. Both Ukraine and Russian needs to compromise their position.  It can not be acceptable if only one side demands are met.
A bully Putin can't tell what another sovereign nation can do or not to do.
That confirmed Russia is losing the war
Ok I'm unsubscribing this channel. Worst reporting.
What are the conditions?
just to get views they don't know nothing
Nothing but misleading with the title on thumbnail
Whatever he wants to grab he grabbed it
clickbait
If he wants Ukraine to surrender, then why is he violating cease fire agreements?  It's already WW3, not everyone is grasping it yet, but we will when China annexes Taiwan.
Wtf?
Putin and russian media's lies 1) I won't invade Ukraine, it's just military excercise 2) I won't hit civilian targets 3) I won't shoot civilians 4) I will allow temporary cease fire for civilians evacuation in certain places 5) Volodomyr Zelensky has fled to Poland 6) Ukraine is controlled by Nazi regime 7) Ukraine committing genocide in Luhansk and Donesk 8) If we wouldn't invade Ukraine then NATO would 9) Ukraine is creating Nuclear weapons  10) And more blueshit to come  Question. How can we trust anything that Putin says? Answer. No we can't
I'm sorry. But he holds conversations  with Erdogan, another barbarian, whilst he kills people of Ukraine....people of the same faith???? Innocent Orthodox people. Then tomorrow he will walk into a church and kiss a icon of the Virgin Mary....This sin will never be absolved....
What putin really mean he won't stop.
Putin: & also if Ukrainian denazify themself & respect people of color...
Lord God, intervene the conflict between Russia/Ukriene.. Lets be Peace.
Mr. Putin uor duty is heavy for whole world but its too healthy 4 a good world 🌍
Thank you India for giving us in the U.K. unbiased information. I have now downloaded your App. Well done.🙂🇬🇧🌹
Desperate MADMAN Putin on the lose.. willing to use Nuclear options..n Xi China leave Taiwan alone.. don't be another obsessive lunatic
You started fight you stop first
Bullshit news chanel
The demands are simple. No American missiles in Ukraine. Why do media outlets not say it straight out instead of the double speak.
i think putin has seen the movie 'The Alamo'.Sad!
That's hope no one kill your daughters
Its indian news channel thats why its spread bullshit.
All lands are Putin's  families property
So what happens when Ukraine wont give in?
To end this madness ,   Mr Putin will be forced negotiate with the Hague on which way he wants to end his days , either by rope or by life imprisonment not forgetting that nothing like this debacle can ever be allowed to happen again and that the entire country of Russia will come under the custodianship of Nato with all of her weapons banned .  Otherwise another Putin may one day come crawling out of Russia's past .
Right! The Russians attack but they want the Ukrainians to stop fighting. 😆 When a Russian negotiates he wants war.
This media is fill with to much lies 😴
A nothing news flash.
Just watched the crap being kicked out of poor Russian protester’s god help them
His demands are for Ukraine to Demilitarize and he takes the country. So that's how it works? Maybe Putin should demilitarize and give Russia to Ukraine?
How many women children have to die before u are happy u butcher
Bullshit, what's that demand?? I'm Unsubcribing for wasting time on this
Not conditions, blackmail
Demands are to halt nato’s eastern expansionism and western support of Ukrainian nazi’s.
Putin is ✅
I actually wasted my bundles
Phuk Poutin .   You want gravy with that ??
What are the conditions?????????
clickbait
He has lost it.
Abe condition kya hai
That's the reverse of what the world and Ukraine wants. 🤣
Ksp lang c Putin🙏
No room in this world for Putin!
What are the demands? Demands? Demands? Demands? But wat are the demands?
She is cute this one
Lies
If all young students in Russia demonstrate - since Putin destroys their future - he has to decide if putting Russia's future (young population) in jail is the right thing to do. The future of the World, might depend on the young Russians - daring to take action.  I fear that within a month Russian will turn into a North Korean style Putin Dynasty - isolated with closed borders. History on Repeat.
The mouthpiece of the Russians speaks...WION has very steadfastly stood by the Russian and it's war   This may cost you in the future when China again eyes your borders.
that's bull shit, Russia's demands are that Ukraine go back under Russian rule and command. He should be told to F**K OFF and Turkey should have told him that. End of conversation.
Long live Palestine,slava Palestine
The ball is by Zelensky now. If he is smart, then he will accept it. Otherwise more people Will die and Ukraine Will be ruined. A true leader is not a leader who fights to the death. A true leader is the one who saves his people from death and his country from destruction.
The west should have excepted Russia's wish for a neutral buffer zone between Nato and the Russian border years ago , instead they kept expending towards Russia including heavy arms .   If Russia would have done this near the US border it would have been war long ago ..
It is all NATO’s fault
No condition mister putin! U have to hide urself! We will defeat u
Ukraine should ask world courts to get a fully destruction repairs or cost reimbursements as some liability and responsibility or accountability.
Tfs. To everyone reading this, Jesus loves you.
"click bait"
Screw this dog… putin in a criminal and now he needs to pay 😡😡😡😡
Crazy Putin
WE ARE RUSSIANS AND PROUD. RUSSIANS, ROMANIANS, NASSAUIANS AND PROUD. MYSELF QUEEN PAULLINE VIOLA PUTIN, MY HUSBAND KING V V PUTIN, MY DAUGHTER PRESIDENT GABRIELLE PUTIN, MY QUEEN PAULLINE VIOLA, PUTIN MY HUSBAND KING V V PUTIN 4SONS, MY BIG BROTHER WHO IS MY QUEEN PAULLINE VIOLA PUTIN MY HUSBAND KING V V PUTIN INDEPENDENT GOVERNMENT SYSTEM NASSAU THROUGH TO SAN SALVADOR PRIVATE PERSONAL PUBLIC PROPERTIES AND ESTATE MONARCHY FORMAT OF GOVERNANCE LAWYER THE HON HUBERT A INGRAHAM. BREXITEERS, INDEPENDENTLY GOVERNED CITIZENS, SEPARATELY GOVERNED CITIZENS, MY QUEEN PAULLINE VIOLA PUTIN, MY HUSBAND KING V V PUTIN INDEPENDENT GOVERNMENT SYSTEM NASSAU THROUGH TO SAN SALVADOR PRIVATE PERSONAL PUBLIC PROPERTIES AND ESTATE MONARCHY FORMAT OF GOVERNANCE.
I do like these staged agreements. The day Putin listens to Erdogan. All a show to make Putin seem he takes advice. And what are these conditions specifically?
We all know that NATO is the problem here, so let not play the fool they want to be
This the last chance to save Ukraine from a war torn nation and uninhabitable conditions for its people. Save yourselves, stay out of NATO, demand your continued leadership and independence and stop poking at the mother bear and messing with her kids.   NATO isnt coming to save you, they can't  and also using yourselves (Ukrainians) and others as human shields is brave but really messy and also not a good look.   If you want to continue the war until the very end accept that all civilian casualties are no longer on Russia but on Ukraine as the entire population is either militarized or weaponized. Let the foreign students LEAVE. They don't need extraction from their home country, they need refuge. Keeping them in the war zone because they are not Ukrainian is in my mind a lack of common sense and criminal and if they perish then it leads to more distrust and outrage and hatred around the world.   We dont want ww3 to escalate any further.  End it.  Or let everyone who wants out, out and yourselves alone die heroes.  End it. Ty.
It's a little to late. NATO should go after Moscow and bomb it down all the way to st Petersburg! He's in no condition to make any demands! Ukraine lost to much just to give up! They will be called cowards. No one should surrender to Putin!
For peace's sake , every body has to mitigate their demands, Russia , Ukraine , Nato. It seems fair to me that part of Ukraine should go back to Russia; a good chunk of Ukraine  was added in 1922 by Lenin. If Ukraine wants to be out of any former URSS influence , I think it would be a necessary compromise.  But then Ukraine's government should be a democratic elected one , and not the usual Putin's puppet .
This Lady just talking in loop
So now that he discovers that it`s not that easy to invade it he backs down?
Ok so it's the same as if I should go into a jewellery shop brandishing a weapon, telling them I will not rob then as long as they just give it to me instead.
How can anyone shake hands with this murderer/killer?
Let us annex you,  control your oil fields,  kick out oil companies that are friendly to Democracy and then we can talk about ending the conflict.     Why would Putin want his oil stranglehold on Europe challenged?
She forgot to say what putrids demands are.
Erdogan is part of the problem .
What the heck, putin can take his military home
India busuk
Your people are week just a lot of sheep
Wion disappointed me today. 🤣. What were the conditions?
I support Russia 🇷🇺 Love From india 🇮🇳
I agreed to stop the war after all this mess and lifes lost to walk back to MOSCOW empty handed?
Who is Putin to demand anything? He is the aggressor!
Which are impossible indeed.
Russia is a one of Super Mark Power in the world, and the important country in Europe. The Western Countries are needed showing that they have a fair dealing and friendship of each other to Russia. Do not discriminate for the peace in these regions. The Western and U.S.A. had made wrong supporting for the 44 years old as the Ukraine President who have a clown background for multimedia. That guy is one of the significant reasons for the war in Europe. He doesn't have enough capacity to run his country and people, who do not have a good enough knowledge of international politic. Why do not remove that "clown man" away by another good political Ukrainian? I think it is the easy way for ending the war now! Need mo comments?!
How do we even know that Russia will stop there? If yiu give a power hungry man what he wants, he will want more
Aaahh thank you. I GET TO KNOW THE DEMANDS THANKS TO YOU
So what's the demand never talked about that did she?
support to russia..
Russian demands are essentially abandoning everyone east of Germany to its sphere of influence and freezing OTAN membership as is, giving Russia and China the chance to sphere unaligned countries.
What are the conditions
So what are Moscow's demands??
Even WION is getting into clickbait
Ukrain is a fox , Russia is a tiger , America a lion and india an elephant and china a dragon.there is a war between tiger and lion and lion Genie pig is fox which in deed is fighting iwth tiger. Dragon and elephant both minding their business's with tiger as a friend.
He is a great leader that Russians had til date....he is brave enough to stop nato and it's countries to reach Russia border
Whoever idiot people's in comments saying Reporter didn't said any condition  wanna tell them conditions is well known all over World.  Does anyone their who don't know what's Russia demands is?  So stop talking like idt
A lot of talk about nothing..Clickbait
What are the conditions, though.
this is crap! he gets to look like some respected leader, all these other statesmen going to pay him the homage he really wants
It is a strange demand that intruders said gave us all your property  I don’t care if if you all are homeless you and your families can work for me to keep up your property in place.  Where is the justice?
what MOSCOW demand from an independent country???
what are the conditions. They can of left that bit out.
Please stop war, think about innocent people. Kids.. Everyone life is important. Due to Corona we lost so much.We need peaceful world please.. Go Green, No bombs please..
Says the leader of Turkey.....
USA should be in Russia taking there nuclear weapons
But you.never mentioned Russia's demands
Putin made his demand unacceptable to the Ukrainians so that the attacks will still continue and the suffering of Ukrainian people is prolonged while the people of the world watches the horror.  Some of his demands are; Ukraine acknowledge Crimea to be part of Russia and Ukraine should also acknowledge the new countries of Donetsk and Luhansk. Countries of his own making. He is a dictator. Ukraine will accept his newly installed president. That newly installed president of Ukraine will submit himself to Putin because he is the president of all presidents or maybe he thought of himself as the King of Kings or the god- king.
How is it possible for Ukraine to stop fighting when Russian militaries are inside Ukraine soil? Putin's conditions are met. What conditions when people's home are destroyed and economies shut down....? What Putin is talking about? It means he will not stop. I would say Let Heaven decide.....
After those visa and MasterCards got cut off, it stop being funny.
God bless turkey 🇹🇷
Your condition will be fulfilled in hell
Putin’s demands will be unreasonable. If accepted they most likely will result in Putin doing this again soon.
Ummm, what are the demands?
You guys haven’t been listening to Russia’s issue since Feb 2008 when Georgia and Ukraine signed that they will become a part of NATO. Even now these reporters are saying demands and conditions but not telling explicitly what they are.   Let me say it then.  1. Complete neutralization of Ukraine 2. Ukraine will remain a buffer state and not join NATO 3. USA and other allies will not put their military on Russia’s border.
In other words, Russia appeals to Turkey to side with Russia and Turkey said no.
This isn't news! Explain the demands  of Moscow
Can’t trust a thug
WION.... Better than western media.
What are Russia's demands?
The demands were to accept Crimea is a part of Russia, acknowledge Donbas and Luhansk as separate Republics, demilitarize Ukraine and adhere to the Minsk agreement.
Putins epic fail and lies are why he wants to deal now, his troops are not good the plan was rushed no training, the whole thing was a embarrassment to Russia!
What are Moscow’s demands?
It would’ve been really nice to hear what those Conditions are.
Lies  they're still bombs  wtf
You can always tell if Putin is lying. His lips are moving!
What are the conditions?
I HOPE PUTIN PUSHS "THE GLOBALIST" TO THE FRENCH BORDER❗
What sort of stupidity is this? I thought the demands will be explained here, but it’s just repeated the title multiple times, total clickbait, piece of crap
What were conditions, after you said it's 2000 times? Tells us nothing
Old men relinquishing power. This is our disease. This is the global pandemic
You never listed his demands
Putin really tried first bumping @ 0:40
...and the conditions set by Putin were: 1.- ?,  2.- ?,  3.- ?, etc?
put a very high price on his head and...
Offer Russia to join NATO = end war.  It's all paranoia that Russia thinks we want to invade them.  Relax, Russia.
You never listed his demands
How it is possible, that one men destroy Russian future for long time? Nobody want make business with them.
There is a difference between fighting and defending. You are asking for a defendant to stop fighting???? BS
Please stop war
IS THAT THE SAME "PUTIN" THAT SAID HE IS NOT!! GOING!! TO INVADE!!? 🤔.  THIS IS JUST MORE "BS 💩"
Do turkey find it unacceptable when Ukraine murdered over 17000 ethnic Russians over the last 7 years probably not because turkey does that to its own people as well.
These goverments dont care about babys and people dying  only god cares
Erdogan: So, what are your demands? Putin - it's not that simple
What are the demands
🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺💪
Why doesn't Russia just join humankind and let go of their paranoid view of the world outside of Russia?
You invaded their country and now you’ve set conditions but want the Ukrainian people to STOP fighting 🖕🏾
it’s all bullshit
Allegations on Ukraine by Putin:- 1) Genocide in Luhansk and Donesk 2) Plan to attack Russia with NATO 3) Are preparing Nuclear weapons   Seriously? I believe no sane person would believe this
USA can't leave the Earth so it  want to be m*f  leader!!
No country wants to surrender to invaders but countries in WWII had to, look at Poland and France. Sadly as the war continues Ukraine suffered more deaths, more destruction, and more people fleeing the country. A reluctant ceasefire could stop all that.
I’m afraid that it may end with agreement on partition of Ukraine like Korea or Germany after ww2.
Anyone else only watch this video just to find out the demands? This is what you call a shit reporter. 😴
Remember after Saddam was captured, he used to say, "I am the president of Iraq, I need my under wears washed". Pretty soon Putin will be in the same category.
Had it, lost it. Time for the funny farm.....
Ras Putin thinks he wins. He is the new Hitler
Back when Hitler was beginning his actual active tyranny in Europe, he used to engage in these pseudo peace talks to. His demands were always about equally is reasonable. I think we can see what is likely going to go as long as people sit around and pretend that Russia will ever be reasonable or back off. There is no circumstance short of taking over the Ukraine orderly, which will satisfy him, and even then that will just be the start. It’ll be about restoring so called glory to the former Soviet union. Then it’ll be about taking over Europe. And who could let that much go without taking on the old enemy a continent away?
He believes they are in Russia best interest !
The sick tyrant murdered children... I will never EVER forgive Putin for what he has done. The 8 circles of hell is waiting for him and his cronies.
Oh POO-tin, give it up already. The world doesn't meet the demands of war criminals, end of. Onlything you should be getting is a crater where the Kremlin used to be.
Sorry putin but the soviet army won't be allowed to come back so nope
Erdogan and Putin share a lot in common. They're both a couple of corrupt and inept chimpanzees.
Does it matter what the conditions are as long as it prevents more deaths !
Putin can't be trusted. The only way to stop him is by beating him.
You can't trust Russia to honor ceasefires.  They are only trying to gain time to reinforce.
Pointless video in which nothing was actually explained lol..The headline basically repeated over and over again lol..
The nerve he asked for a condition he don’t have the right to ask condition putin need to put in  jail because his a criminal
Ukraine please surrender so we can stop the bloodshed. Thank you
Zelensky Said: "If we will fall, you will fall so please don't be silent"
Russian condition all in one  Get natos weapons out of Ukraine  All Ukraine get out or except we are taking it back  So what's the problem?
Putin ca not stay in power he is a war criminal and must be held accountable for targeting civilians and nuclear power plant
NARCISSISTIC PHYCO.....they ARE liars!!!!!!!
What conditions? The most important part you leave out. What a useless video
The agressor still needs to be held accountable . Sincerely hope we all remember this.
Figured the U.S. would offer a save face solution for Russia. We would all lose in WW3.   US promises to remove sanctions if Russia withdraws troops. Crimea is recognized as Russian territory and Ukraine is neutral.
Nuke Moscow NOW,why wait,lets all go with a BANG
Screw Puddin!!!
Putin's terms is total surrender and I will install a puppet in charge but I will not help in the reconstruction of Ukraine as we are broke
putin u dont own ukraine or no other countrys u scumm killer .u n biden needs to be locked up.
And the demands????
And Moscow's demands are??????
War criminal do not get to set conditions!  We are coming for you! Get out fo Ukraine while the getting is good! You are going to stand trail! Either in front of the UN, or before Jesus!!!
Bull shit after all these, take him out no more talk. Don't trust all these non sense talks.
Not Moscow's invasion but Putin's invasion of Ukraine.
When did she change the dress?
Why should Ukraine fight Russia for NATO when NATO refuse to provide any military assistance other than cheerleading on the sideline?  And they look pretty cute in them NATO skirts!  Seriously, what would Putin do to Ukraine if he takes it?  To give you an idea, 95.5% of Crimeans voted to join Russian Federation (Google it!)  Do the Crimeans feel oppressed by Putin since Annexation in 2014?  Come on, now!
what are Moscow's demands?  You forgot to mention that.
Start World war 😏
It’s not “fastest refugee crisis since WW2” because was already one in ‘90s on Balkan.
Demands
No nato it's simple
Put in is a bully. Ukraine should fight.🤬putin
Russian aggression will end when Putin is dead.
Moscow demands are met? Leave ukraine
So basically there are no conditions. It's like asking the person you're stabbing to put their hands down so you can stab them more easily.
It's too late for that
He once laughed at someone in this cabinet for wanting to negotiate now he wants to negotiate you know he's desperate
He's insane ‼️ to hell stop fighting ‼️ they are defending themselves ‼️
Russia doesn’t want your NWO. Neither did Trump….don’t believe e everything you see.
Only one condition. Putin surrenders or his army gets torched.    Putin is acting like the bratty kid who wont just take his ball and go home
As I recall the demands of the aggressors are denazification of Ukraine.  May I suggest that Russia lead the way in order to show how it is done?
craxy for killing ukraine civilians!!
Wion you are absolute dip shits!  Thanks for nothing.  The title implies that the conditions would be listed. And the conditions you listed were 1) stop fighting  2) and meet Moscows demands.    An absolute click bait title! I'm unsubscribing and will choose. " Do not recommend channel". Your a disgrace to India.
This reporting is repulsive and should be reported by everyone.
Best condition to end war is to stop attacking them. Who else sees through putis bullshit
Sooooo .... what are the demands? 😏
What a BULLY Putin is: "just roll over and let us overcome you and we will stop FORCING YOU to fall under our BULLYING! Let us STEAL YOU, and we will stop bullying you because we will OWN you." On the school playground these kind of bullies get expelled! God gave man free-moral agency, and Putin wants to play GOD! He is not God Almighty - so he's now on God's hit list just like Alex the Great, Hitler, and all the rest of the bullies of mankind that have been PUT AWAY by their own vices!
Very nice 👍🏾 job! Sounds like the best thing!
I personally support Putin and I have deep condolence with both side human looss. This conflict starts only for this *joker* zelensky
Here's the deal: I'll keep bombing you, but you must stop defending yourself, and give me all my demands without condition... Is that sincere negotiation?
As an american i support russia and all its endeavors
Putin knows he entered a war he can’t win. Someone need to remove Putin for good.
The only reason why the West wants Putin out of Ukraine is for  t
Great news update!!  1.52 minutes of detailed demands given by Russia
Here’s our list of demands.  1) Consent to our list of demands
Love you Russia
Not an invasion - not a war - just a simple military operation !!!!!
Condition is Ukraine will never be a part of NATO
How now Putin is speaking to Erdogan about peace if Erdogan have sent drones to Ukraine wich have killed so many Russian soldiers and destroyed so many armored vehicles? Is it that much not important how and in what conditions people lives have lost? Desaster… maby the world will be best place to live in if we bann all the politicians deamit
Thank god. Yes yes. Peace.  Hopefully I hope dumbass won’t.  Change his.    Mind
Russia must ceasefire before any talks can begin. Killing and displacing innocent men, women and children? Putin, you’re the definition of evil.
Hell keep attacking so u can bring him down for good!!
Good.  Let's get peace going. Her the war hungry Americans out of the way
In other words it won’t stop
" born with the mark of the beast"
LOL. Hell, Ukraine may liberate the Russian people from Putin before it's over.
What are the demands? Prior to the invasion he said get USA off Russian border in Ukraine. USA did nothing but call him names such as evil . A week or 2 before the invasion there was a headline stating the equivalent of do you hear me now . His address was primarily at Americans.  Months or close to a year prior he asked why can't Russia hold the Olympics?  Nobody heard him. Those who did could have no effect on deciding where Olympics are held. All these decades beyond the cold war & media still do not tell us what Putin or Moscow are lacking. I suggest equality consideration a little compassion and understanding and a lot less bullying. Please do a follow up program telling those with ears and ability to hear what he wants demands or whatever so we can listen to hopefully end this now and any escalation of war. What happened to diplomacy? If
Putin has been extra old and his decision s too
What condition?? That's totally asking Ukrainian to surrender with no other options. Putin is getting crazier by the minute.
Putin's demand is... Ukraine to be permanently neutral The two broken free regions to be regarded as separate countries Crimea to be part of Russia
PUTIN SHOULD ONLY NEGOTIATE  PEACE WITH UKRANIANS HE MURDERED. THE SANCTIONS ARE SEPARATE NEGOTIATIONS FROM THE WEST.
The USMilitary would wipe the floor with Putin.
You never told us what their demands are.
See this is not good it's clear that once putin get the Ukraine he will keep going and attack another place, we're heading into ww3. See the interesting thing is that their army is in the Ukraine, so if another army stood with the Ukraine the Russians would be forced to retreat to protect their own country.
What are Putins’s demands. This report was really a waste. We all know the Putin will stop if Ukraine surrenders
If you have been keeping tabs on what Putin has been asking for years now, you wouldn't even have to watch this video.  No change in his wishes: NATO stay away from my backyard!
0:39 dictator putin goes for a fist bump
And India is silent. Disgusting
Genocide. Hell Will be his end
Ukrainians should stop fighting in their own country against the Russian military occupation!!! 🤦‍♂️ Not only is Putin mad but he’s also very stupid.
Conditions? Putin has acted with ignorance and brutality against a peaceful non-threatening neighbor. Erdogan better disinfect his hand after that handshake with Putin. Innocent blood is all over Putin.
Great video I gave a like and shared
promising to say something but wasting time to say nothing shall be reason TO UNSUBSCRIBE. FROM NOW ON LET OUR VOICES BE HEARD BY ACTION TO reshape the world how we want it to be.
Two dictators equal to a infamous dictator during second WW that REALLY was a nazi...
And how is Putin reacting to Turkey selling drones to Ukraine
What are the Russia demands?
Instead of repeating the same sentence over and over again, it would help to mention what the demands are.
Well Vlad usa murderer now bigtime. U gotta pay.
I think I completely missed the part as to what those conditions are😒
Russia's demands are set to be:- 1) Recognise Cremia as part of Russia 2) Recognise DPS (Donesk people's republic) n LPS (Luhansk People's republic) as separate nations 3) Lay down your weapons and surrender
Why isn't there more help  for these poor people
What are Moscow's demands?
So Russia scare that Nato will put missile at their border in Ukraine and also at the same time not scare of anyone in this world? What a stupid argument Putin has.  he created war for attentions. To prove his words mean something, no more no less. Nato can still shot their missile from other Europe nations, 10 second longer wont make a difference.  In 1million years Nato will not have the balls to fire the first shot at Russia no matter where their missile is at.  Putin = dictator.
Video title must be "How to lag one sentence in two minutes"..
Putin can't b trusted
Putin wants this war
Tough economic sanctions are beginning to bite and they may cause a Russian revolt or implosion. Putin's demands are just pretence. Fact is, Putin the aggressor, is in no position to make demands after destroying parts of Ukraine and turning 1.5 million Ukrainians into refugees.
Moscow hates Putin.  Eliminate both Putin and Erdogan and let the world flow again
Putin why give up so soon! Putin you can not not Fight the whole world.
Only if Ukraine first stops fighting, what winning...
Turkey is the country that still will not confess to the genocide of 1.5 million Arminians. They have no credibility.
Somebody said for the Ukrainian president not to go to the peace talks or he would be killed. But it looks like one of the chief Ukrainian delegation members has met an unnatural death.
Now? Why not before? How many died? Shit
I feel sorry somewhat for the Russian people all because an Idiot is Running there Country another Hitler
Biden, hillary and Obama are knee deep in this organised by the bilderberg group Russia are destroying their underground bio labs Ukraine are innocent but not their president..
Another set of useless talks you're not going to see a free Ukraine if you give putin what he wants.
This war ends only when Putin is killed.
I love Putin  putin is good president  not like  Ukraine  . . Ukraine president step down so that the war is  stop step down salensky
UN should go to the hell to resque all   the refugeies !!🤣🤣🤣
Whst are the demands. Duh!!
Please! He forgot to say please !! So no. Go do one!!!
So what are Russia's demands - exactly?
But what are the conditions……..repeating the same thing again and again and again and again and again and again 👎👎👎👎👎👎
I admire Zelenski in his resolve in resisting the Russians but I think Ukraine should comply with the demands so Russia will stop this bloodshed at least for now. The international community and NATO are not helping Ukraine that much. Ukraine has no choice but to comply.
Let Ukraine run their own country and everyone else butt out !
Duh what are the conditions then?what a dumb article.
is this nervous music realy necessary
러시아뉴스?
What are those conditions
'What are Moscow's "demands"?  Poor reporting.
Putin stop invasion then Ukrainian will stop fighting and Putin have to pay for the damage too ok, Mr Putin 🥷🏾🥷🏾🥷🏾
worst news channel, what are moscow's demands??? :)) you keep repeating with no information said
Dont trust Putin so easy , he always put everyone on the wrong track.
LEID, SCHMERZ, QUAL , MENSCHEN quälen und am Leben ergötzen rein um Kontrolle, Macht der Lust am Leiden  der Anderen , ergötzt sich Putin an der Qual der Menschen. Besser kann Böses nicht sichtbar werden.  Die Luft wird dünner auch für Putin,  er hat scheinbar  1 Feind? Auch sein Schiff kommt ins Wanken  die Masken fallen langsam.
Ukraine is Russian Cuba  Putin warned and warned he clearly told them not to cross Russian red line. All the West had to do was give Russia written guarantees that Ukraine would not join NATO.  But no the West goaded  and encouraged Ukraine to pick a fight with a super power thinking Putin was bluffing. Do not blame Putin and Russia without mentioning the role NATO and US played in this. The central banksters have destroyed the world economies yet again and history shows whenever that happens they always start a war to hide their complete incompetence.  NATO led by US never wanted a peaceful settlement of this crisis because that was not their goal. They pushed and pushed Russia in to a corner for years until Putin said no more. Personally I am sick of the duplicity of NATO they have invaded and destroyed country after country ALL under the pretext of false accusations.  Now US and NATO have the audacity of pretending to be on moral high ground about Ukraine.  The Europeans are stupid for not standing up to US pressure and should have avoided pushing Russia into doing what it has done.  It's ok for United States because all these wars are always fought thousands of miles away from their country whereas Europe could be in the thick of it. This is pure gangsterism being perpetrated by US + NATO,  they are (100%) to be blamed for creating a potentially horrific nuclear war which could affect the whole planet.  Instead of provoking Russia further and flaming the situation by supplying weapons to Ukraine they should seriously facilitate a ceasefire.  Ukraine will never be and never was in any position to seriously stand up to Russia, all that will happen by prolonging the inevitable is more people will die and the end result still being the same..
Putin can go to hell. He's screwed up big time and he knows it. He's backtracking yet still making demands. He's sent young and ill trained conscripts to fight his dirty war.
Urraaaaa....!!!
Putin’s demands can change anytime... better specifically say what the demands are now for Ukraine to meet
nu conditions.. no demands..putin loose
This is what happens when we demarcate the Earth. Humans has to learn lot more from other living beings.
Sounds like Putin just wants to act out punitive action against the Ukranian people for not dancing to his tunes 🤔
Zelensky for the love of all humanty just give it to him we dont a nuclear war
putin demand : Ukraine should stop Fighting  Basicaly a Bully picking up on a victim, and says he  will stop as soon the victim stop defending himself. WTF.
So what are the demands
Sad to say only NATO can end this… but fighting for peace is like f..king for virginity
Nice clickbait 👍 wion…
That's unacceptable economic term & conditions... Sanctions  already lost 😂
I'll believe it when it actually happens..
He's probably going to resupply and give rest to his troops then work in his next phase of killing. Shoot this  Hitler #2 asap !;!!!!;
Russia has the right to defend its territory from western aggression.... Imagine Russia putting weapons and missiles at US backyard pointing at washington.. I can see why Putin has to take action...It's sad Ukraine is NATO's pawn..Long live Putin.. We stand with you..
Thanks for the update; however this 1.52  minutes could have been cut to 15 seconds, the same content/statement was just repeated 4 times within this news
Delusional Putin
What are the conditions of Russia. You could very well mention those briefly.
Never trust anything putin says. Much less what he wants after all he has done since coming to power especially now after all this and all the inocents that have died He is like a karen the more you give what it wants the more it will want and demand
So, what are Putin's demand?
Bazaar to me how politically illiterate the masses are. The only reason Russia invaded is because NATO and Ukraine are disrespecting the agreements that were made decades ago. Ukraine can not join NATO, because this allows USA and its allies to build bases and military infrastructure near Russia's border.
I started watching video to know what are the demands and the whole vidoe was about people to know that whether its russai  ukraine or india vs pak we news anchors will always and forever work for "TRP" and not the real news wion falling in line with aaj tak
What are the conditions
so basically , the turkish president is sitting on the fence,,
Israel is the light of the world 👏🇮🇱🇮🇳
Putin will sure go to jail, he will never get away with this heinous crime he has committed  against humanity, the people of Ukraine in particular and Europe in general.
🙏Hi friends I have videos for you on bible prophecy and the end times. Please go to Papa Joe Fortner or shockwaves of the end times or The watchmen series with papa joe. Thank you and God bless you all 🙏
Putin will stop only if Hollywood celebrities stop virtue signaling. One more ‘ imagine’  and he will use nukes
Wtf what's the demands, stop repeating the same words again and again honestly the worst news update in the media history 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Ww3 let's go!!!
Ukraine    dont give an inch        putins finished    and he knows it      u got the rat on the run
Reporter: Moscow's demands are met Reality: No body knows wt r the demands!
Wow, thanks God, continuous prayers to God, not Russian neither Ukrainian, but  I have compassion with families and individuals who are affected ,their life is still precious as gold, let's love one another, concern for each other helps a lot,each one still wants to live and enjoy life, Peace and love of God  reigns!!!!🙏❤️❤️❤️❤️🙏🙏🙏🙏
Good to see that the Russia-bashing angle has been dropped and the hysteria which goes with it.
This was too little informative, as we were not told what Putin's demands are
Putin full of 💩
What a way to waste time! With these useless news repeating 4 times and saying NOTHING!!!
Zelenky's last words: "War is nothing but a comedy".
Now we get it , Wion and India are Russian servants.

What are the conditions?
What demands????
Probably to stop the sanctions then how will he pay for all those civilians that were killed
Hypothetical!!  If CHINA invaded the US and with a surprise attack crippled its Air Force.  If they called on NATO to create a NO-FLY zone, would they refuse because they were scared of going to war with CHINA.  What an expensive and useless organization.  God Bless and God Speed Ukraine.
Putin must beg perdon Ukr if not his soldiers will not see their parents again. Putin can't obliged 🇺🇦 what he wants, he is defeated day and night.
Turkey go out from Nato the evil alliance of you really sincere...
lol 😂 😂😂😂😂 that’s like Adolf Hitler telling England to stop fighting and capitulate and then I’ll stop fighting you… insane!!!!!!
LET THE NUKES FLY
Putin wants all homosexuals, transvestites gone from Ukraine
Prayers for Ukraine 💜❤️💜❤️.
Before the war President of Ukrainian said to Putin mind ur business when they Wr trying to be with NATO! So Russia 🇷🇺 minded his business 😁😜
Awkward report, It feels like it was heavily edited.
Where is palki ?
Don't trust Putin, he's a liar and a KGB criminal.
Putin a evil person
You just said the same line 3 times. 🥱
so what are they?????
The demands are for the Ucranians to stop fighting? OK. What's the tradeoff, the quid pro quo?
Amazing a man the size of a 6 year old scares the Fcuk out of everyone.
What are their demands
???ask Ukraine to stop fighting and Russia continues to kill Ukrainians and invade😆 is Putin out of his mind?
Slight clickbait or what??      :-)  Peace
Turkish lion and america is still show viewer
They will not fight if you are not invading.
So that’s was a lie and a sike
Have I have rights
what exactly are Moscow's demands? anyone got that noted down somewhere?
in other words. they will stop when ucraine surrenders without conditions
What are all of the demands? I would LOVE to know that?   If it's ONLY not joining the united nations? Or do they have to just give over their country to the Russians?
If Ukraine stops fighting? They are defending idiots. You're invading and you have to stop. Kuch bhi bolte hai.
Please read Matthew 26,52. And, I want to recommend the songs of Elisabeth Hiebert.
Turkey, China, Iran, Russia is a formidable opponent. NATO won't be able to do much short of world war 3 if they form their own coilition.
what the hell was that..what are the demands?
Putin starts the fight
Thank you Turkey, please keep the dumb US/Israel out of it...! We know they want a full scale war in Europe, away from them again...!
I don't believe anything that's coming out of his mouth at this moment..
I didn't know that the world only consists of Europe and the USA..🧐😈 You have to change the history of the earth world map ☝🏽 You cut yourself into your own flesh ☝🏽🤯 with your nazi behavior now you show USA 🇺🇸 EU  true face !!  the power of politicians will extinguish our earth and thus all of us 🌎🤡 When:  Russia invades: "INVASION"  USA invades: "LIBERATION"  Britain invades: "CIVILIZATION" There were so many wars in different countries and none of the countries involved the world and none helped children humans ☝🏽and put the whole world in this situation...why should only Ukraine get the support of the whole world because of blue eyes and blond hair and White skin 👀and bring the whole world into danger 🌎👀😳   They should rather go for reconciliation instead of forcing the whole world to hate each other and war 😡 Just for NATO membership, he kept his compatriots dying and destroyed his country.  It was most dangerous when he called on innocent people to take up arms and fight against an army.  If he knows he can't afford to fight, why didn't he choose peaceful negotiations?  I see no love for his people.
Don't think that's an update. Basically the same he's always said. I'll stop bombing you if you let me invade.
WHY THERE IS A NEGOTIATION WITH WAR CRIMINAL,BPUTIN???
Smh all you media does lie so much . How much they pay all you to say all that
Ends with a Nuck Bomb😂😂😂
All the idiots who side with Russia were not alive when Russia invaded Georgia. Twice. Caused a massive guerrilla war in Serbia.  And caused the Chechens to attack Russians due to constant murder invasion and indiscriminate killings.  Putin wants to restore the USSR has openly said it several times. He wont stop with Ukraine. That's why he sent in conscripts. To save the combat ready troops for when he invades other countries.  Its the same crap Hitler pulled when tried for world domination.   History is repeating itself staring in the 1930's  Russia is the new Germany. China is the new Japan.  Anyone born before the year 2000 that isn't brain dead knows this.
putin was really tryna fist bump him
He just wants them to surrender.
Give him a taste of what we gave him in Afghanistan ,Stinger MISSILE, an a no fly zone.
And what do the expert YouTube war correspondents have to say about it? 🤔😅
Russia can end Ukraine in a few days, it's easy to destroy, build back is the hardest part. Ukranians are going to come back ashamed, poorer and having to rebuild everything. You must first care about life, Ukraine is not, and never were equipped to pick a fight with Russia, they may as well change their president next time. The man is seeing that this is a lost battle and is asking his own people to be brave and die, not only that, he is trying to convince the world to engage on a third world war for him. Guys, we just had a pandemic crisis, the world is broken, do you actually want to have a war on your door now?
Only an stupid can accept a "demand" from a modern crazy dude lol
Hitler. Said surrender your country to us and there will be no fighting.   No war.    Hmm how did that turn,out,,,
Why would anyone believe him
Putin is a con artist 🎨 🐷🇬🇧🥳 stop  Stop fighting I can just walking in and roll over like the dead 🐕  🤣🤣🤣
All countries must sanction USA . That's the main warmonger
My thoughts exactly, what are the conditions. I know that Ukraine has blocked the flow of water to Russia for quite some time, that was causing a lot of hardship.
Let get this stupid war over with....get it done Turkey in behalf of the whole world
My only demand is the world abides by my demands, well that's pretty simple.
These are not sanctions - they special financial operations - Its not a no fly zone -  its a Stinger and  Strela exercise -  two can play this game
So what are the demands????
Add a special no-fly zone. Someone needs to tell Putin if he launches a nuclear missile it will be mutual assured destruction
Why don't you tell us what conditions/demands Putin has set? Is it because you think we are morons and won't be able to understand them?
Putin must withdraw All troops from Ukraine and pay for damages to Ukraine cuties
Why you are not mentioning the demands???
Couple of things here: (1) Ukraine is not fighting, its defending its territory and its citizens against destruction and genocide (2) No matter how well meant (apparently) a President of Russia is in dealing with subordinate states from a position of strength, elevating a slumboy to that post is asking for trouble because a slumboy knows only one thing - grab whatever you can however you can before somebody else does; and the more the better.
Demands are He keeps East Ukraine and He get to install puppet government, and the sanctions removed
Anything to stop the killing of innocent people just do !
Ukraine. Are. Not. Innocent.
They are not sanctions so stop calling them sanctions but they are "Special Economic Operations".
Coward..NATO and Biden...
SENT IN THE CLOWNS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Wise men wonder, while strong men DIE
Russia should now pull out thier military personel and pay for the damages in Ukraine and pay for the lives who has died in bombming and killed by thier military personel..
Where was NATO & UN when this happened  ??? Usa Operation in following countries  1. Grenada (1983-1984) 2. Bolivia (1986) 3. Virgin Islands (1989) 4. Liberia (1990; 1997; 2003) 5.

What are freaking conditions? Stop repeating and start sharing info on demands. Geez!
We need to give Putin some way out of the mess he has put himself into... It's the only way to stop this madness...
Adolfo Putin no es dictador de los Ukranianos. En Ucrania hay presidente.
What Moscow demands and conditions are?????He thinks everything will be according to his will ....and lets not be naive...Russia destroy and wash his hand and shake for his conditions agreement that will served what???sign peace agreement but not blindly .Who said  that he will never attack ...lets see and wait if this come from the Real Talk and guarantees.All this war affected the whole planet and myself for hoping the best.If this is it God be Witness !I Pray and hope that Putine will give his sit and go away from Political that never allowed Russian poeples to have the right to speak.Enough of dictatorship.
This channel always tells pure lies it funny
Why is NATO still negotiating with this killer.  Why is he still demanding what he can’t have and it’s not his to start with. Enough is enough!!  He wants Ukraine and he can not have it  HE HAS BEEN VIOLATING EVERY CODE HE CAN, COME ON!!!’
Who can trust Putin? He promised to cease fire for Ukrainians to evacuate, then opened fire on them! How can anyone trust him? If Ukrainians stop fighting, Putin will zoom in!  Gosh! The war tyrant is now begging Ukraine to stop fighting?!
Too late Mr. Putin! Hope they realize that you have already lost  to Ukraine, including Crimea.
America and NATO will not allow Ukraine to agree to Russian demands.
The conditions are, russia give up
Stop Fighting while continues lol
Russia has won. Ukraine has been defeated. 🇷🇺
Cuba is communist,90 miles off the coast of Florida,so how does little Napoleon thinks he can tell a sovereign nation what dictates he will impose.
Uraa 💪🇮🇩🇷🇺
Bomb   bomb bomb bomb the Kremlin, Putin, he's evil.
I thought Spider-man: No Way Home was the only thing people don't wanna give spoilers lmao
Much rather die for democracy than live under a Putin regime....so give Ukraine every help they need if that means the unthinkable so be it long live Democracy.....
HE is setting Conditions????  Are you KIDDING me!  PUTIN is CRAZY!!!
TELL ME THE DEMANDS AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Why did it seem like Putin was gonna give that dude a fist bump before he shook his hand?  hahahaha
Y
No matter who Putin talks to, unless it is a fellow dictator, which even Erdogan is somewhat of a dictator, the terms are very lopsided, and Putin will never be satisfied. Terms will only be set to favor Putin and none other.
We must not give in to Russia demands. Any demands on their part is unacceptable
Plz add backs dislike button
Russia should be stopped fighting first

While you watch this, the "Bat Lab" is still up and running, do you think China stopped making bio weapons because they got caught? You think Leaders that "bomb" should be in office? You think a protest or chants will save your freedom? Has anyone started working on a new governing or monetary system?  Can we  tera form Mars, but not earth? Can we use the oceans for energy? Has anyone put any thought into making real change? Does anyone really even care? There's only about 150 years of essential resources left on earth, is this what all the deception, depopulation and wars are about? I have all these answers, but do you?
Better arrest zelenksy and stop the war asap
Absolutely pointless news cast. Jesus.
Jesus, she must have said Putin will end the invasion if his demands are met five times but never said what the demands are. Useless video
The conditions are you must accept the conditions?
This is my new News Forum to listen with the current events... Finally I found a reputable news agency at last, Gravitas....
Putins word Saying if ukraine Stops fighting cant be trusted... He broked those words already😓
How many times you are repeating the same sentence again and again….no info, just repeating same sentence again n again
They only know about the meeting nothing more (click bait)
Ukraine  has  its  on  nazies  army  there  helmets  have  hitlers  swastika   on  them  there  killing  there  own
Putin gas gone crazy bombing civilians to "protect russian civilians".
You have not told what are those Moscow's conditions?
That asking Ukraine to give up. No way. Ukraine all the way
Russia wants full control of Ukraine under Soviet rules. Mr Z must step down. I don't think Ukraine will surrender. Just like N & S Korea.
If Putin calls his thugs back to Moscow, then a solution can be achieved. Not sure how situation will be after the war, will there be other internal conflicts and factions demanding power?
The demand is that Ukraine must stop fighting. Is everyone deaf in here?? Has no one in here taken an education??
ukrainian people are victims of a war between nato and russia ,ukranian people are the victims in this war sadly ,zalenski want to westernise ukraine ,ukraine and russia are same people
Putin wants a large big Mac meal from McDonald's, a Costa coffee, a new teddy bear and a night with Nicola sturgeon
I think it is Putin's way to take over Ukraine with the conditions he is asking, We as the World should not allow Putin to win cuz he will invade other Countries. It is World War Three Already. Ever Country is sending there Civilians Volunteers to Ukraine  cuz they know Putin is a mad man. Putin is now a war criminal.
Putin is greedy😏
I wish I could Volunteer for Ukraine
Well, the reporter must have atleast said a million times that Russia will stop the invasion of Ukraine if they adhere to their demands but never for once cared to report what RUSSIA'S DEMANDS actually are , this reporting be like when we are asked to write a thousand word essay and we don't know shit about the topic. 🤡 WION can really be a joke channel sometimes .
Great news.. so what are his demands? Ever thought of sharing that??
And what are Moscow demands???
It's good to hear that war is about to end.
First time I've disliked a video from this channel.   WHAT ARE THE DEMANDS?  REPEATING THE SAME SENTENCE BUT NOT SAYING ANYTHING. 🤦🏻‍♂️
God Be the ring of Fire around the Ukraine!
What the🙄🙄🙄🙄 is this some kinda suspense movie ?
But, what are his demands?
So.. Basically.. Putin.. Who is losing the war and putting his own country in a terrible situation.. Is now playing the big guy and setting conditions which are " Russia will stop fighting if the Ukraine stops existing and submit to Russia".  I am not Ukrainian.. But If I were.. I would rather die fighting than becoming a slave to Russia.
See told u Putin will only stop once Ukraine surrenders. There is no negotiation with a communist. They will level Ukraine if they don't comply.
Yeah, put your weapons down so Russians can execute everyone and throw Zelensky in a cell next to Alexei Navalny.
This news channel is turd
Nearly a Cabbage!!
Bitcoin is the most profitable that will enable you earn constituently on a weekly basis it is no news that it can make you wealthy in few weeks time. when you invest you make profit on a daily  basis plan including extra bonuses Everyone needs more than there salary to be financially stable. The best thing to do with your money is to invest it rightly, because money left for saving always end up used with no returns.
So WTF are the conditions??
any idea what demands she is reporting about?
No deal! No one cares about putins demands!
Putin's actions speak louder than words, perhaps the West ought to set demands like withdraw and pay for damages and reparations before sanctions are lifted. It should be expected that the Russian state is not to be trusted as long as in allows itself to be ruled by savages. The Russians have had about 135 of terrible leadership.
Unfair demands. Not mutually advantageous. Clearly. ✝️🙏🛐☝️✝️
Next time , this maniac will attack another country and again set for another set of conditions.
Don't try to control others just because you have muscle power.  - Amanda pluntim dass
Gets those dirty nazis out of there Putin
There losing let's smash them to pieces not in any position to make demands! Let's go and smash Moscow to bits see how they like that! And put him and his generals on trial then hang um high! God bless Ukraine 🇺🇦
I'm impressed with Russia's civility. western news media is an embarrassment
What are Moscow's demands
Let Russians join nato too problem solved 🤷‍♂️ and we can all love ❤️
Hope this works out, fingers crossed.
No one has any reason to trust Putin . Tomorrow he would make an excuse to cancel any treaty made today.  Welcome 21st century to the mad men style of the 20th century.  You cant reason with these types of men.  They enjoy others pain.
It's incredibly agonizing to watch Putin just rase ukraine to nothing, while nato/U.S. just stands by and watches (with sanctions). AHHH! I wish someone would just end Putin. It is 1 single individual (PUTIN) vs the WHOLE GODDAMN WORLD.
Better tell Putin that he is fighting the Eukranien. They are defending themselves and their country.
RSS was licking the British Boots prior to 1947 ! Now BJP is licking the boots of Vladimir ' lunatic' Putin !
America would do the same thing if Russia was on the Mexican border no NATO no war simple as that
Is Putin going to lost ?
WION -The World is One News, just wasted 2 minutes of my life saying nothing. What "demands"? The Ukrainians and world knew that before the war because it's common sense.  The demands are put down your arms and surrender. That was also was true for Hitler and all other dictators thoughtout history.
Sounds fabulous. Let’s sign off on these kooky conditions and get back to those post pandemic parties. 🎉🥳🍾👯‍♀️
Please end the war
Russia is going to lose.
Wars and rumors of wars ..it shall come to pass.. prophecy in the Bible
One word, Bayraktar
Moscows demands are met? you didn't say what they are and that is perhaps because only he knows his evil mind and desires.

Putin is a crazy little man
Praying to the GOD OF ISRAEL, The JEWISH MESSIAH JESUS CHRIST the Lord, The Son of GOD.  That the people of UKRAINE come to Salvation in MESSIAH JESUS, for the Salvation of their Soul and Flesh. To know PEACE, is to know JESUS.  Ref: ISAIAH 1:16-20; JOHN 3:3-7; ACTS 2:38; PHILIPPIANS 4:7.  Amen.
And why should Ukraine believe him? He's proven to be a mass murdering liar. And peace deal is just him buying time to rearm and resupply his forces.
One of the demand is if Ukraine will stop fighting and let Russians shoot and bomb them
First off Putin's word hasn't any value now since most of the stuff he says is just lies and second, since he lies so much he cannot be trusted either. He has burned his bridge to the ground and there isn't any rebuilding it.  Edit: All these Putin hero worshippers are disappointing and don't seem to know history very well. There was another person who took the same identical path that Putin is taking right now. His name was Adolf Hitler.
Don’t waste your time with this video. I will unsubscribe.
Telling your plan that you will not fight back to an enemy/dictator is like saying go ahead and do what you want.  I'm with you and I'm your puppet but I will have to appear fighting you in the face of the public...wink wink.  By the way, we will contribute money for your need to finance your war...I'll dance with you behind close door. (Putin:  You better because I can pull and tighten the string on you, remember you are my puppet).  By the way, in truth, I'm taking over the whole country for their resources, but we'll just say, I need to protect my country from you and your allies surrounding my country.  Even thought, I know my country is safe from any of you because I have all the means to destroy the world...so dance with me,..wink wink.  I feel the power...hahahahaha..stick it and here is my middle finger to you all... run and keep your tail tacked in....hahahaha.  Believe me and trust me..hehehehe....I will not take over other countries afterward,..trust me, really.
Erdogan denied fist bump :)
Great coverage ....it's like the foreign version of MSNBC , big headline and just repeat yourself endlessly
Putin , created the mess, he can end it as well , but the damage  has been done already nothing will ever erase this madness he started.
War is what for?
Your channel is like TV9 in India No content
Advantage: putin
Israel's cruelty to Palestine, why is the media silent?
It ends when Putin is dead. That's when it will end and NOT until then.
A Christian Ukrainian leader might relent to save his people.  An Imposter (that word is intentional) President would and will not.  Why?  His people aren’t dying.
What kind of weird news is this?  It's like what you get when you order news on WISH 🤣
Conditions? Capitulation he means!
At the end of the day,tomorrow is for planting a potato.
No matter Syria,Iraq,Afghan only matter white skin and blonde hair
We are tired about dat guy putin  why dont he go to fight by himself  than killing the youth declared the war after u go n hide
Headlines with less information just to attract viewing. repetition
The Condition is follow my condition
*Zelensky's death and new president for ukraine.*
Uhhhh
so what there saying is, be a good boy roll over and do as they say......
This isn't breaking news, this is empty repetition!
As Putin is an exKGB agent, so spreading disinformation is one way of changing the narrative that Russia invaded Ukraine and should withdraw from Ukrainian territory and that includes Crimea. Until then,  I'll reserve my judgment, "talk is cheap, actions speak louder than words."
Biden is a traitor . he is the real friend of Russia. Still buying oil from Russia do i really need to say more. Biden needs to be prosecuted for war crimes to.
Two very important leaders in our world
This is a joke..Russia..started this....why are we listen to Putin at all..
Mf psyco poetin should seas fire and pull out of ukraine....he only started....then talks should start...!
Garbage clip.
Guess I'm exiting from this video without actually being informed and knowing what the "conditions" that Putin, not Russia, wants are.
Terrible reporting - on and on that Russia will only agree to cease fire if its conditions are met - so repetitive - but never said what those conditions were - do your homework or shut this network down. Worthless!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Is this channel even considered news if you repeat the same word salad over and over again. Put actual substance and the moscow demands in the video.
.
As I recall, Ukraine did not start the fighting.  They defended themselves.  Putin acts like an angry, brutal father.
Let's support Ukraine Fighting for democracy and freedom
Putin is a lier
Under the world principle say, a country have a right to own sovereignty and if fear and distrust cause to a country. That country have own right to seeking help and of own right to joint to any other partners. Therefore, any neighboring country have none such any right to stop or invade her country.
Basically surrender smh
Thank you Sir Vlad peace is really needed now
do not meet this maniacs demands. He should be taken out.
Vladimir Lunatic Putin !
You had your chance Putin. You fucked up. You just screwed your own nation with your vanity project. The sanctions dont end when you say so. Keep 'em going.
The problem with history repeating itself is we have alot of youth who haven't had the life experiences to simply say "enough is enough I won't stand for this" , and this is why history repeats itself...they just aren't experienced yet in the world and fall victim to this evil scum of the world and later learn from their mistake history will continue to repeat itself in this manner there will always be a little dictator born there will always be a little psychopath born that wants to take over the world
Ok. Please mention the demands!
Cease Fire ?   Well that's just Great !   In the U.S. President Biden is on his knees praying the war he started doesn't end.  His own policies cost billions in taxpayer dollars and no way to recoup any of the losses if a cease fire happens.   His parties self inflicted food and fuel shortages, major cuts in health care.  Doing this will surely squash any chance of re election.   Totally unfair.  For him anyway.  Pease is the right answer, for people-not democrat's.
Why on earth would Putin back down to a world of cowards who will not defend Ukraine as it fights alone.
Putin might be smart to cease fire.He should be careful that his attack dogs dont turn on him
Omg. Stop repeating the same garbage over and over.
Liar liar pants on fire. Who will believe him?
🇺🇦 Slava Ukraini 🇺🇲  I hope the Indian people wake up and stop being so close to Russia. India's military relies on Russia because majority of their weapons come from there. So that means you can't ally with the West if war breaks out against China/Russia. You won't be trusted by the West and Russia won't be able to stop China from taking over India. So either you stay with Russia and have 0 allies if/when WW3 breaks out, or you abandon Russia and go with the West where you'll have 30+ countries on your side.
Moscow's demands can be restated to "Unconditional surrender".    But the truth is that Russia has no way to win.  They don't have the logistical support capacity.  Especially now with Russia's economy having just been nuked by international sanctions and restrictions.  This was supposed to be a blitzkrieg.  A lightning war.  The troops were supposed to be feeding off of Ukraine supplies after conquering them in just a few days.  Instead they're low on fuel, low on food, and totally out of morale.    And if the Ukrainians SHOULD stop fighting,  do you think Putin will honor his word and call the dogs off?  Are you really that naive?
Putin should demand that the Ukraine deliver all the sleepy Joe & Hunter Biden corruption to be revealed.
Who the hell died and made you decision maker for a country that isn’t yours.? Anyway you have an appointment  with God soon and it will not be pleasent
what are the demands
LoL...Puttin taken Ukraine as a hostage and "won"
P.S. Putin should be kicked out of NATO! The Ukraines should be welcomed with open arms. I literally hate Putin! I don't like to hate anyone. I seen what he did with my own 2 eyes. Putin is acting like a child having a temper tantrum.
Putin does not want peace. Thats all
Vlad still doesn’t get it. We will set the conditions, or we will keep destroying his economy.
What???putine want zelinsky to surenders his country??after putine has made all this mess and killing soldiers and civilians and walk after putting all the stress and poeples what they went through to live as refuges ...just for what ????what do you mean if Ukraine stop the fight....what Zelinsky get for his country and what agreement to make sure that he will not be attack ..Wait a minute!
NO POLITICAL PEOPLE JUST PEOPLE WITH GUNS WHO IS WITH ME........
If you give in to Putin now, there will be stopping him. Next will be another Baltic country, with more conditions, then another. A ceasefire is impossible, because Russia will always break them at their pleasure.
it will end after they take Crimea back and then they will join NATO. therefor if Russia attacked them then they would be attacking NATO.
ऐसी भाषा मे बोलो जो हम जैसे गरिबो को भी समजे
Father God I pray supernatural no fly zone over Ukraine. Do not let the enemy planes fly over Ukraine in Jesus name. I also pray. 2nd Chronicles 20 against the  Russian army. I pray Ukrainian people and Russian people rise up against the evil Russian government. In Jesus name.
NO POLITICAL PEOPLE JUST PEOPLE WITH GUNS WHO IS WITH ME........
Putin doesn't seem to have grasped that he no longer 'sets conditions' for ANYTHING.
What are the conditions???!!!! Very vague content.
Well he would say that again after he got Ukraine and will complain again his next country has to be out of NATO membership. It could be all the counry next him as he extends farther west... he is the one who possibly invade next country not NATO!
Skrew Putin....bomb Russia, with the big ones, teach this asshole that if he even dreams of stepping foot in another coutry we will use twice as many the next time. He will stop
Biden’s war. Thank a Democrat for this shit. Better watch out for China.
Putin already buckling.
Here are some sanctions: Russia drop all of its weapons and leave Ukraine, Russia rebuilding Ukraine City's - Russia Providing PTSD Counseling for Civilians, Russia Apologizing to the world for its ruthless attack using cluster bomb ammunition.  Special Note: Not allowing Ukraine into NATO means 1 thing....another attack in the future.
Comments with the most highest amount of Keyboard warriors!
Fact is he does not want his demands to be met . He would much rather take Ukraine so makes unreasonable demands
Putin’s conditions “give me what I want…”
Trash the CIA & its pals and there will be an immediate improvement of the situation.
Gota say wion is keeping me updated for sure! Thanks team and bless everyone effected in this act of aggresion 🙏🕊️🌎
Give ME A GUN AND I WILL BE THERE TO DEFEND THE PEOPLE OF UKRAINE..........NO POLITICAL PEOPLE JUST PEOPLE WITH GUNS WHO IS WITH ME........
Yes we know they want their demands met
Thank God....
Since when one can do what he wants to someone else home, and it OK?
Nothing has changed.
against nato we all support RUSSIA .........  VIVA...R U S S I A...URRRAAAAHHHHH... LONG LIFE PRESIDENT POUTIN STAY STRONG VLADIMIR DON'T GIVE UP . . .R U S S I A . . . nato is NAZISM...
Putin needs to step off these conditions 🙄
Ukraine won't stop fighting until Russia leaves it's territory and there's no justification to met moscows demands because they are in the wrong in the first place.
No surrender.russia started this and Ukraine will end this by piercing Russia in the heart.
I Don't think so
Whats the point of having that title for video when you don't specify the demands of moscow!!
"Those who sit in the middle of the road get hit by both sides of traffic." Borders matter. Freedom matters. Friends matter ~ just ask **China** Russia, Iran & North Korea.
This crack pot invade another country and asked them no to fight. Oldman lost his mental balance.
We can do the same to him. “If you don’t meet our demands we push the button.” Count me in I vote to do that.
The best for Ukranians is to flee to the last one and if a war starts in another country they join in. Putin is asking for their guns and loyalty, if they give their guns they may be slaughtered, just like the jews in the second world war, if they don't they will die in the confront anyway. So that the best option is to flee and discuss their return after, there is nothing else left  to do now.
Russians r right it's that Ukraine , Georgia and other USSR countries r brainwashed by usa and nato.....and now they are gonna suffer . Putin is right he can't let usa control his Neighbouring areas....it's USA's fault that war started 👍
Ukraine: get out. take you crap with you. take your dead with you. btw, the west will seize your $400B in foreign reserves currently frozen and give it to Ukraine  in payment.    a multi-generational hatred of Russia by Ukraine and surrounding eastern European countries and unifying of Nato and its expansion by adding Sweden and Finland has been guaranteed.
“Russian will end the war if Ukraine stop fighting”😅
WHAT ARE THE DEMANDS THOUGH
Don't trust this treacherous Putin. Keep fighting, Ukraine 🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦
In other words ,Ukraine's demands should be ignored
Our pm modi call putin that's why he is now on talk....
Nothing new here. Keep the sanctions in place.
They are not going to be put in a concentration camp or death...   No point in taking anymore with Satin..  after his evil remarks in useing nuclear weapons...  at least the west never once did that!.. because we are human.  Nato could hammer that lot and he knows it..  bring in the  Titanium curtain for at least 100 years...👍
What are Moscows demands? They're meant to capitulate, its never going to happen.
My asshole conducts special military operations on my toilet every time I eat taco bell
Putin knows he’s losing. Alas NATO can not negotiate with terrorists.
Lmao! To sign a peace agreement Ukraine has to stop defending and let you take it? Tiny Vlad...How old are you?
Russia will end invasion if demands are met. Russia will stop its invasion if moscows demands are met. If demands are met, Moscow will stop its invasion of Ukraine. The invasion into Ukraine will cease if its demands are met. Putin sets conditions that if met will halt Moscows invasion.   So informative. Thanks Wion!
The world has to realize for people who don't keep treaty, they never will.They will keep manipulating moving the goal post each time,yet it seems like nothing except to the man that's put upon.
Lol if Ukraine stops fighting??! Hello Russia started this!
This sound suspicious maybe they plan 🤔 in advanced to invade then negotiation peace i bet turkey 🇹🇷 in this with Russian.
Nato wont help ukraine with soldiers nor agrees that ukraine wont be inducted
Conditions after destroying Ukraine?
Sanctions to increase cost of living for everyone accept government officials time for a world rebellion against all governments share if you agree
I think Ukraine was just fighting out of fear so the Russians had to fight back at them. What were the Russians doing in Ukraine anyways? I know this war will stop this week
What were the demands?  Report all the news!
You are all brainwashed
In the first place,  the aggressor has no right to put demands on freedom loving countries cannot accept. Consider withdrawal of troops who are wrecking havoc on a country committed to defend their sovereignty and integrity! And there will be peace! I salute all citizens of the Ukraine as well as volunteers who come from democratic countries to fight  and to protect their people.
He will soon dance to the world music 🎶 because his lost
He's like a shorter poorer Hitler.
I love Russia
Haha Z will not stop Fighting. A long war could cause bank crisis In west. Hyper prices, act smartly
I don’t really see Ukrainian soldiers stop fighting as long as Russian soldiers are on their soil. Would Russian soldiers stop fighting if Ukraine invaded Russia? That’s what I thought.
Wth!!! Since when do we make deals with terrorists! Look what he did to that country, people's houses, their children and husbands. We should make demands on him to pay to rebuild, to pay for funerals & pay families money to get back on track.
After granting humanitarian corridors and then firing upon them, I don't put any stock in anything Putin says.
Oookay putin. They'll stop fighting when you stop invading. How misleading his words are, rolling off of that forked tongue.
Can’t they get a reporter with a proper accent at least ?
NAW SORRY THE PEZZA OVEN IS A DISTRCTION MORE INTERESTING.........NOT
Why must they stop fighting first? A ceasefire is normally declared so that both sides can come together and hear their demands.  What's really going on here is that Putin wants to give Ukraine a false sense of security so Russian troops can easily march into Kyiv without any defense.   Putin has made the Ukrainian government to be Neo-Nazis and genocide-enablers. With the Russian economy sinking, and Zelensky being seen as the hero, there is no way Putin would make any concessions, especially after he has declared wanting to take over the entire country. He even said in the past that he wants the Ukrainian military to disarm.   Whatever demands he is making won't be good. Saying that Ukraine should stop fighting is obviously a trap. If they accept that term, it would be over for Ukraine. Putin won't meet Zelensky. Instead, Russian troops would takeover the capital within seconds while Putin prepares a speech on how he decisively fooled Ukrainian government and "liberated" the country.
What a bully putin is, he greedy, oppressor, dictator, I feel sorry for the Russian people
Putin knows he is losing this war. Now he plays tough and pretends to be the winner who is making demands and conditions to end this war. Losers don't form conditions to end a war. They take them!
WORLD WAR THREE IS A GO .  LETS SEE HOW YOUR GAY FRIENDS PROTECT YOU NOW
Poor Russians to have such a president…….understand now why he loves the Belarus president…….idiots are always searching for an equal partner!!
And the conditions were what exactly?
He is not a president, He is a DICTATOR.
Turkey Contribute what?   So what are his demands? There aren’t any except violating a sovereign nation and bending its future to Putin’s will and delusions of grandeur.    Click bait.
Endogan is a “Madrasaa”Branded semi -intelligent “Jihadi” puppet in the hands of USA & EU…..!😄😄😂😂🤣 We all Hindusthanis are with 🇷🇺 RUSSIA!! Russia has every right to claim Ukraine….!!! USA & EU have no guts to fight either with 🇷🇺 Russia & 🇨🇳 China, even together….!😄😂👍
The demands are:  1. Changing the president and recruitment of  a puppet one. 2. Don't make any further step to be a NATO member.  3. Disarmament of Ukrainian soldiers. 4. Ukraine should be guided under the leadership of Putin /Russia.  5.
So. Just 'surrender',  then?
Trace the call and drone his ass please.
He’s basically saying, Surrender. And roll belly up and declare me the winner. And quit destroying the weapons I’m using to kill and destroy your country with.
Why should the Ukraine stop fighting... Russia started this...They should stop...
Sign this shit and end it
lol u guys can't down play Russia
I don't know what the demands are but we except , can we all get along now?
ok give him what he wants.
What the hell was that.
Putin must be crazy. Putin needs to recall his troops back home.
What are Moscow's demands? Shouldnt we know what they are? ...
Good opportunity for zelensky to save  the Ukraine people
This means he's running out of money
Sounds a lot like terrorism tbh
It is very imperative for US, Uk & NATO to give a bond to Russina that they will not go for eastward expansion & that Ukraine will never join NATO .... Only then war will stop...otherwise only God knows where it is heading. ..
Putin is saying "My Way or No Way!" So negotiations are dead & he is willing to blow up the World! It's called a "Little man's complex.🤔
Putin threatens with nuclear war as if Rusia and all its people will not be is incinerated. Trump needs to tell him, he Putin and all Russians will die if he starts WW3. WAKE HIM UP
So other words he will stop attacking when everybody gets on their knees and kisses his feet and listens to everything he says just like he threatens with nuclear war on everybody if everybody doesn't do what he says this is ridiculous I consider all our countries cowards anymore threatening with nuclear weapons is an act of war
What a waste of our time
It is a good thing that war is so terrible or we should grow to fond of it.
Still never said what the demands were
We, Vietnamese girls team, pray everyday that peace 🕊️ will return to Ukraine very soon 🇺🇦🇺🇦 🙏🙏
Wtf is this news channel. No coverage of what the actual demands are? Smfh.
I really thought Putin was a real soldier BUT he is a THUG and best disposed of by his own people. All dictators have met a similar fate-his should be much sooner than later!!!!
That mean Game Over😂
Ukraine stop supporting nato
Ukrainians stop fighting and Russians walk all over the place. Is putin mad!!!  Get out !!!!
Always read russians backwards. If he tells to stop he will attack.
Just and there lying politician in service of Satan. Don't believe him
Putin is very fair. Go President Putin...!!! Zelenski must surrender. Why don't he. He knows he can't win
As my Dad said “There are NO war like people, just war like Leaders” !!!
The USA and Great Britain are the guarantors of the territorial integrity of Ukraine, according to the Budapest Memorandum!  Please fulfill your obligations! The Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances comprises three identical political agreements signed at the OSCE conference in Budapest, Hungary on 5 December 1994 to provide security assurances by its signatories relating to the accession of Belarus, Kazakhstan and Ukraine to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). The memorandum was originally signed by three nuclear powers: the Russian Federation, the United Kingdom and the United States. China and France gave somewhat weaker individual assurances in separate documents. The memorandum included security assurances against threats or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan. As a result of other agreements and the memorandum, between 1993 and 1996, Belarus, Kazakhstan and Ukraine gave up their nuclear weapons.
Soooo Russia invaded Ukrain but wants them them to stop shooting first?? Did I hear that right 🤔
Plz stop war because stock market is down because of war...plz....
Aka, total surrender
Lol...Putin is in no position to put out conditions
Putin the lier just have exercises. Who believes him after all these abuses?
This is chess not checkers lol 😂   Putin won’t stop even if demands are met.  He has proven this time and time again.  Don’t t give up Ukraine 🇺🇦 !!!  May God Bless the People of Ukraine 🇺🇦 🙏🏼
He gave conditions on how to prevent conflict before the invasion and Ukraine and nato ignored them
So they just want war then the obviously what a dick he is !
Exactly, if the ukrainian people REALLY want peace, they simply stop fighting! If you fight, there cannot be peace, what else could be more obvious?! PEACE simply means: You are NOT fighting! Quite common definition though!
I don't know why people expected there to be peace. The only way there is peace for Russia is if Ukraine surrenders- otherwise- nope.
Nothing has changed.
Putin is loosing no surrender Russia must back out and stop the bombardments
RUSSIA DEMAND = Surrender Dorothy!!!!!! NATO RESPONSE = When monkeys fly out of your butt!!!!
Ukraine won't surrender to a dictator and a coward like Putin he wants this to end because he didn't expect Russia to face such a huge loss in tech and soldiers
Pero Putin chico, who are you  to do whatever you wanted? Are you crazy eh?
No mentions of 'what conditions' putin has highlighted. Waste of my 2mins. Cheap thumbnails to attract clicks. Please  GrowUp n feel responsible journalism
News channels are deliberately  mssing the prime demand appoint president who reports to Moscow, this condition will never be met by Ukrainians .  So, war will continue.  NATO is just one drama repeated by people all over the world.     The condition will never be met,  Putin cannot stop the war due to pressure within Russia ( deaths of their soldiers) and this will convert to urban guerrilla war between Ukrainians and Russians.   Suffers  Ukrainians first, Russians Second, Rest of the World third.   the drama goes on.
Putin in Spanish means??? 🤣💁🏼
What are their demands ?
Have been following this channel since 1.9 now we at 5.3...really fast growing... WION
Has Palki a day off?
India fail to do anything lol 😂
You cannot trust Putin.
We Indian with you russia.  Any way volunteers I joined your army . We with you . And I love you russia 🇷🇺
That was the shittiest piece of news I've heard in a long time. The anchor repeated 3 times the same thing without even listing the "conditions" to be met. The whole video was literally repeating the title of the video
He's lost 😔 .
Putin's a boss everyone is afraid to confront him
Long live the Russian president Vladimir Putin together we are ❤️❤️❤️❤️
あんよがラー油だ！！🐱ちゆまり…じやわかれーはしゆぱいしー！うちも…うちのラー油もしゆごいでしゆ！！こだわりぬいた漢方薬！
Putin is a madman and needs to be held accountable !!!
We need a democracy government in Russia !
Weird the Palestinians were and still are kicked out of their homeland and Europe  conciders them sun human with no rights to live.
Just know the Ukrainian president made a mistake to side  with NATO/USA the prime killers of Sadam and Gadafi and indirectly incited Russia to kill Ukrainians.The world can't have peace before the destruction of the US and its allies
Why should Ukraine met his demands he's lossing.
I think the west have to fulfill Putin´s conditions to end up this blodshed, and specially those agressive sanctions against Russia, and the Russian people, and if they refuse, it means they WANT this war to go on so thousands will die.
Regardless, Putin needs to make restitution for the damage he has done to the Ukraine people. War should not be used to get away with senseless murder.
Putin was going to give him a fist bump
STOP the WAR NOW !
Putin wants a neutral state in Ukraine not one with NATO membership or NATO weapons. All z Ukraine has to do is agree and war will end. The ball is in Zelensky’s court.
Maybe...oh, I don't know, tell us what those demands are.  WION slipping into mediocrity
Great breaking news......and the conditions are ???? Clickbait !?
Putin is suffering from megalomania!
nah liars will always lie even if conditions are met I’m still waiting for 🌅 as he says even prepared his nuclear troops 🤷🏻‍♂️ shame I guess it’s all words no actions
Does anyone really need to be explained this? He won't stop his war until they surrender, how is it none of you can understand and interpret it, is beyond me.
What leverage does Putin really have over the world or Ukraine for that matter in order for him to make demands? It's not like he's in a position where he has the advantage as far as the world can see.
The message from God is Omega
Yeah right!  Like every other statements putin has made during this alone.
Putin feels he is on the verge of failure, which is why he is defending himself in another way
The demands are that Russia is going to stop killing people and go back to the motherland!
Moscow's demands are capulation, they will be slaves in there own country.
Answer this didn't America and Britain sign a treaty with Ukraine that if Ukraine got rid of their nukes the both America and Britain would help them if they were Attacked by another country. That's the reason Ukraine is saying America and Britain are letting them down, we are surpose to be standing at their side in Defending them and NOT sitting on the side line/fence
The rapist says -  stop resisting.
Shame on Putin!!!
Lol Putin is weak
So Putin will stop fighting if Ukraine gives up, lol. Good luck with that.
Zelensky neo Nazi government in Kiev accuses Ukrainian MP of state treason The prosecutor general is seeking to put the opposition politician and long-time Zelensky critic on an international wanted list for disagreeing with the WEF NWO narrative he promotes with his Centuria thugs.
Its TIME to counter ATTACK and be PRESIDENT of RUSSIA then have a SPECIAL ELECTION
Maybe tell us what those demands are? This is why you are 3rd level broadcaster
Useless news.!what are the conditions . You said nothing thanks for wasting my time!
putin, wake up. the ukrainians have put you in your proper place and exposed your military to be but a dud. you are not in a position to set demands. you will go down in history as the biggest joke. just disappear and the world will be a better place.
Putin: Give me what I want and I'll stop kicking you. This man needs to be put down...
Gee thanks, now i know that Russia will only stop if the demands are met which are the demands.
The title's all you need to know guys, she repeats that title 10 times over 2 minutes.
Pouting Putin piss off and leave the Ukraine, you are enemy number one (1) you have no rights at all to demand the Ukrainians to lay down arms they are defending their rights to live their way NOT YOUR WAY
Shame on NATO & USA
What are the conditions? Nothing is explained..
Don't surrender to bullshit putin
Next chapter Istanbul becomes Constantinople again
quite the same as a 'Police' who says "stop resisting!" while beating the life out of someone.
So basically he is saying "Don't have troops fight us as we try to kill you (Ukrainians). We will stop killing you once you give up your country to me." I don't even know how he can even be considered a human being.
And the USA never did this  lol
If Ukraine stops fighting?Putin means Ukraine should stop defending itself?How possible?
Not going to happen.  Ukraine put down it's defense and Putin will run them over.  To end the war, Putin needs to realize he screwed up and pull out but I doubt that'll happen either.
And the big question is?
So what are the conditions then? What kind of reporting is this.
Get it together media, this is click bait, is that the term? They suck you in but they say nothing useful?
WEAK REPORT ! VERY WEAK !
Demand is to surrender lol
NATO is a war machine. And Russia is not communists. Think about it.😐
Why everyone keep saying its the worst since world war 2? So are we suppose to forget all we know and believe that? There were no problems with Yugoslavia(kosovo), Syria, Libya? There were no millions of refugees flooding Europe for the past 10 years? There were no wars in Korea, Vietnam, Afganistan, Iraq? Were not they infinitely longer and bloodier?
Ueful news there... What's the bloody demands?
Ooopss even russia wants to end it amerika and nato will make a way to push ww3
So basically: Become a Russian puppet and get your shit pushed in or become an American puppet and get your shit pushed in.
Great short news. Just what i needed.
What could these "Demands" be?
Putin needs starved out and Russia needs to be the Next North Korea.
Commentator: SLOW DOWN!
both rogues in their respective countries in suppressing their own people and their neighbours.
What are Putin’s conditions? A very important key point to reporting that was completely bypassed.
Its responcibility of nato which creat this war nato achived his goal but cost of ukrain and russia same  ukarain why not understand this
Negotiating towards peace is a good thing.  Ukraine and the world must provide more carrots and more sticks for Russia. More carrots for Ukraine.
WHAT IN THE F--K ARE THE DEMANDS. RUSSIA NOW  CAN CLEARLY SEE THAT THE UNKARNN PEOPLE ARE NOT GOING TO LAY DOWN. THEY HAVE TAKEN OUT A FEW TOP GENERALS. 💯💯💯 MAY GOD BLESS THE UKRAINE 🇺🇦 🙏 🙌 ✨ PEOPLE.
Putin has a simple demand to Ukraine. Give up your liberty or die. To NATO pull back all your troops from Eastern Europe.   No WWIII  just war with Russia. From now to eternity Freedom must win!   NATO do whatever it takes and défend freedom now.
Back tracking now and trying saving face while getting his tantrum conditions met, not asking for much is Putin? Kill people and get a reward for doing it. One day soldiers will stop following evil leader’s orders and war will stop.
This guy may be encouraging more countries to join NATO and worse, arm up. Putin would be able to catch more bees with honey; not vinegar.
All bullies and criminals set conditions after tormenting a hostage victim. I dont understand how a war criminal get  the stage to demand conditions.
Putin should stop bombing and shooting at Ukrainians. Putin's conditions as himself can not be trusted
So what are the demands? Lol
Huh?
Respect tumbling...what are the conditions?
Europe is playing with fire, but the agenda is what they want
Unfinished news
F..k  Putin he lies can't believe anything he says just take him out
What a shit news report Jesus Christ
Mans is desperate.
The only lasting thing Puti has accomplished is to ensure no country gives up nuclear weapons and tries to obtain them if they don't have them.
The problem is Russia is killing civilians this is not a military operation he’s destroying civilians
I know one starts from a position one ought to be prepared to move from, but I hear nothing here that suggests there has been any attempt at making a valid suggestion. I suppose the question is, how long will Putin carry on oppressing his neighbours while his nation's economy drops through the floor. At this rate he may find he's played his nation into the arms of China, as it's "saviour".
Please call (vp) what he is evil
So what are Moscow's demands?
all states that have been bombed by America in the last 100 years [32] should side with Russia and totally destroy America in the same way that America destroyed other countries with bombs, the war in Ukraine was made by the Americans before Ukraine wished them was to provoke a civil war in Venezuela, NATO-led Americans are war criminals who have never been held accountable for their crimes, their democracy is bombs of innocent civilians, Americans are rich only while at war, and all the dirty work for it is done by NATO terrorist organizations led by America terrorizing the whole world, America would be a poor country if they stopped fighting all over the world, they are aware of that and therefore cause new conflicts like this one in Ukrainian order to stop the American terror perpetrated by the Americans, led by NATO, all the countries that were bombed by America must join the Russians and destroy the pagan America for all time, and then their terror, which has lasted since the Vietnam War, will end,
I guess she should be a lawyer... lawyers are known to say alot without saying anything🤷‍♂️
Puttin tried to fist bump him haha
Too many countries scarred Vladimir Putin because he is very dangerous person
People please don't believe in Putin's condition, his agenda are evil only to bring destruction.
We don't negotiate with terrorists 🖕
Moscow's demands are well known and have not been changed for years.However, we know almost nothing about Kiev's position, despite the fact that president Zelensky is pouring video clips.
Yessss
might as well make a “special economic operation” on russia ….
Demands are,  Ukraine to never join NATO Ukraine report to Moscow only Ukraine to give up their oil and freedom to Russia.  Russian elite become richer and richer.  Keep up making Allah MAD.  empires fall. Don't make him more MAD as it is.
Where is the dislike count when needed? Just wasted 2 min of my life, thanks.
Si Selenski firma esas condiciones, su servicio de inteligencia lo asesinará por acto de traición. ¿Estoy diciendo estupideces?
Putin got his right middle finger on Biden's back door
Putin will end invasion because he knows he will not succeed a lot of countries support ukraine and Ukrainians still fighting, russians soldiers, tanks and plane was died and broken. His country also was in trouble... His plan with his fucking friend Biden will not successful. Biden is a traitor
Putin invaded Ukraine, its up to Putin to stop the aggression and go home. Ukraine is only defending its home, Ukraine did not attack or invade Russia. To ask Ukraine to stop fighting is ridiculous.  Russia needs to turn all their military personnel and equipment around and go home.
Stupid report. What are the conditions??
Is this an actual news report of a piss take ?
Russias demands : ukraine stop fighting now and trust russia to do what it days. .   That amounts to being in the middle of a 1 on 1 shootout , stopping shooting while not behind cover and hoping they do the same
Watching this clip was a waste of time, she just read the title over and over again
Breitbart reports about the labs creating biological  weapons in Ukraine.  Wonder if Putin is simply there to remove them to stop another Wuhan  bio attack????? But MSM doesn't report this.  Imagine that.    Think and check everything.
Western countries started the war now all ran away and Ukraine payed the price because of their duffer president USA couldn't fight its own wars and ran away in Vietnam Iran afganistan now giving talks to Ukraine fight til death your father is not dieing innocent Ukrainian are dieing warning to Taiwan dont trust USA tomorrow this will be your faith America mission accomplished you want weapons to fight we supply pay the bill now western countries to Ukraine you are no use to us your entire necular plants destroyed why we need you h
Why's everyone commenting about not saying what the demands are? If you haven't been living under a rock, you should know.
What are the demands?
Putin knows he’s running a war campaign to lose. This terrorist is just not yet aware of the bounty on him that makes him a target.
Somethings telling me that if he was to meet his demands and potentially stop any further issues with Ukraine, he’s still gonna be held accountable for his crimes against the people of Ukraine. So either way he’s fucked is my theory 🤷🏽‍♂️
That' just another way of saying unconditional surrender.
NATO has been building military on the edge of Russian boarder, compromising Russia security. Putin has talked about this for 6 years with NATO and they have done absolutely nothing. It’s NATOs fault Ukraine is being attacked right now. If NATO weren’t so corrupted none of this would’ve happened. Not to mention the neo nazi war that’s been going on in Ukraine for years which has left 13,000 people losing their lives. Ukraine will never win against Russia. They should put down their arms. Putin does not want to takeover, he wants to demilitarise Ukraine to assure Russian security, that’s all. It’s NATOs fault and Ukraine is being used as a pawn by NATO
He’s sniffing something! Totally out of his mind. And he thinks making a fist for the occasion is appropriate. He’s been hanging around dumb people. Putin is a war criminal!!
Russia is sending minivans to supply their troops, I think we can just ignore anything he has to say now.
Every Year there’s something new it never fails to amaze me how the universe works
Russia bots, Russian bots everywhere.
When to have to reach the word minimum on an essay... Can we just report this?
He is another rogue...it seem putin is gay...not satisfied with local hence looking at Ukraine
Only reason he’s done it is he has estimated that no one will intervene.  Someone has to prove him wrong . It would be much tougher for him to target another enemy.
WTF didnt Turkey shoot a few Russian Jets down in Syria ?
One and only erdogan can stop this bloody war as Putin have great respect for erdogan and putin know very well in the capacity of erdogan
"If you give a mouse a cookie, he's gonna want a glass of milk." Air Force One.
Disbanding Azov Battalion should be one of the demands. They are ridiculously cruel.
NATO didnt need to fight  Just needed to show his power If they did it demands werent here , Putin woud just retreat  If this goes on there is a new possibility since Putin goes with : less human losses , destroyed half Ukraine and even get demands  If we dont take down sanctions maybe Russia will be "99%" united and on side with Putin If we take down sanctions this was a total joke  To take down sanctions we ( everyone ) shoud ask : Putin out of presidence Next attack , invasions or especial military operation on any country is WAR
What are the demands?
He himself is in a fortified bunker. Shame
Oh that's good news ! Hopes& prayers  for the best.. for the sake of humanity.
This lady sounds like the scammers that call very day😡😡
N 'oublier pas. Le peuple syrien. .. palestinien. . lybien ... Qui. Depuis des années continus. A vivre sous les bombes. Quant n 'est il .de. Ces. Pauvres peuples. Les Oublier. De l 'onu. Et de tout les occidentaux. En général ????????
I love ❤ to heared that way.....at last thank you Lord....
What are the demands?
Putin! Go BACK To from where you came! You FOCKING Flruit cake 🍰
What are the demands???? He wants Ukraine to surrender, why will they surrender when Russians are getting obliterated and Russia are losing billions every day?
Fair play.
On November 10 Biden signed a memo of understanding (zero media coverage) stating that the Ukrainians had a RIGHT to join NATO - Russia's Red Line - guaranteeing an invasion. Blinken was obviously involved in this fiasco. The Russians IMMEDIATELY decided to invade to prevent the future surrounded on all sides by NATO. Sort of what JFK involved in the Monroe Doctrine to get the Russian missiles out of Cuba 90 miles off Key West. Read the WSJ article of 3/5 (Sat.) on what is one of the greatest foreign policy debacles of all time and remember the date: NOVEMBER 10. We are getting played big time.
Whelp, back to being the Grifter hub of the entire world, Ukraine. Sorry about blowing up all your buildings and killing all your people.
The only conditions Ukraine should accept from Russia is to remain neutral nothing else
Bull Russia go to Ukraine now withdraw
What conditions?
Crazy
This lady just repeats her self lol
Russia should return everything they took from Ukraine and pay for damages. Putin should also be held accountable for war crimes. This was an unprovoked attacked on a peaceful country. Humanity?
Russia demains means making Ukraine part of russia and calling it that. Making Ukraine disappear.
well what are the demands ???
This sounds like nothing. Ukraine will not stop fighting because of persuation and encouragement of their actor president to fight and do not retreat. This war is the last man standing unless one of them will retreat or die.
Please present a complete broadcast to what where those conditions that Psycho wants. It’s just a bluff to gain momentum!
They haven't kept their word once since they sent that training mission into Ukraine. Fool me once, fool me twice... not happening.
So the conditions to end the invasion are that the Ukraine surrenders... so basically there are no conditions
This channel is getting more bass by the day nothing negative about putting there friend ukrain is its own country Putin is a bully
The Ukraine president must surrender and save the slaughter of innocent people and his country this is not a personal ego trip for him
west ukraine must stay out of nato forever. period
Russians are the aggressors, the fighting stops when Russia stops.  Putin is essentially asking for a free hand and occupying the country without resistance.... No, Mr. Putin. It does not work that way and by the way, your society will start to unravel due to catastrophic economic regressions.  You are running out of time to get out of Ukraine.
Putin the terrorist requested for military war,  the nations of the earth were smart enough, they instead served him with economic war. Mr terrorist enjoy your sumptuous meal to the full. Russia's recession will plunge Russia to the abyss.
You look at his conditions and laugh.  He wants to take over a sovereign nation and cut off the head of its government  like a madman. Killing civilians in the process while stomping on their freedom and way if life BUT.... Sad as that sounds,  if his "CONDITIONS" are met it MIGHT be a way to end the countless tragic deaths of Ukrainians.  It would be bowing down to a evil dictator "for now" and it sounds demoralizing,  but it had to be taken as an option at this point. It would be more than just a swallow if pride at this point.
The conditions should be: Russia will leave all the territory of Ukraine. Crimea as well and so called Luhansk and Doneck "republics" as well.. Russia will pay for damage it caused. In exchange for that, the world countries will lift the sanctions.
Market go up up up
Putin is losing a war. He's losing his own people's loyalty. And again, this little bully's got the chutzpah to make demands?   **yawn** I think not.   Let's see how he feels next week during the economic crash
PUTIN didn't said "if Ukraine stop fighting, he said if their "stop resisting".
Everyone is saying that 1,5 million refugies are already fled Ukraine. In 10 days, they must be flying.
What are the conditions? What are the demands
What are Moscows demands? Why arent u reporting this?
Please end the invasion. Putin stop!  No more war.  No one wins a war. We all loose.
How can anyone shake the hand of that POS
That's it , the most reasonable explanation is Putin has officially lost it in the pandemic lockdowns ... 😂
Ok great! And the conditions are what now?
Cornpop China Joe Biden Voters! YOU DID THIS!
Just close that old iron curtain and be done with it Putin.. then you will have no issues with the west and you can live in your little isolation bubble and rule as you wish.
❤️❤️ Putin ❤️❤️
This is the problem with the youtube dislike button. We can’t see if this is a waste of time.
Two dictators  making a plan hahaha
Let me see....Putin as part of his withdrawal says that Ukraine must not join NATO.  Absurd...Putin's actions demand Ukraine join NATO
Putin has no intention of ending the invasion, its just another delay/mis-information tactic.
WHAT DO YOU WANT EGOMANIAC MASTER????? CRUSH FREEDOM ALL  OVER THE WORLD???? KEEP KILLING AN ASKIKG FOR MORE. MORE ...  MOREEEE .  DEMICRACIES CRUSHED... THE ONLY HUNGER EVIL HAS.
Like anything this guys says is worth the air his words fester in
West need to send in military assistance  instead of watching this unfold
But what are the conditions??? This clip is meaninglessness since it didn't provide the conditions.
The NATO expansion gotta stop man. Why we gotta antagonize them man
I hope the stress of this war gives Putin a stroke
Don't trust this madman, he will renege on whatever is agreed.
NO-FLY ZONE OVER UKRAINE, NOW!!
Russians must just go home and the war will end.
India step up and condemn this ridiculous invasion! You will be nobody's friend in future if you do nothing
Where were all these people ..when Israeli bombs kill Syrian children..
Putin, these are not sanctions they are called SPECIAL ECONOMIC OPERATIONS!!!
Yea do they will go by Putins rules  Most likely
Special conditions put down weapons so Putin could take over Ukraine.   Don't do it Ukraine!!!
What are the conditions????.
Moscows demands are met , that’s the whole thing ?
Wion is trash reporting now…
It is clear that a peace settlement is close. This is the best deal for both the Russian and Ukrainian people.
Well what the hell are those demands???
AUKUS & NATO WEST PLEASE STOP YOUR PROXY WARS (English Wars) ARROUND THE WORLD.  REST THE WORLD LIVE IN PEACE.
Putin Is the best gentelmain
And the conditions are…..?
No way!
WWIII.
Russia is misusing her power.  This is very wrong.👎
Putin is man of words since 1st day the conditions are same.
Putin's conditions are: Do everything I want and I will withdraw.
IF KRAMLIN WANT UKRAINE STOP FIGHTING KRAMLIN MUST WITHDRAW ALL THEIR TROOPS IN UKRAINE HOME SOIL, THEN STOP THE WAR  OF COURSE.
They must try something that old man I used to trust called Biden is most dangerous old man on earth.  America knows well how did they solve matter like this before when Russia wanted to enter in Cuba what is difficult now to do the same! Biden and his party which is always thirsty for blood of humans
What are moscow's demands?
Абе не ми предлагайте този маймун самовлюбен
What are moscows demands?
Putin is the agressor, commiting war crimes.  Pray for Ukraine.
Putin’s nearly broke lol.. now wants to talk
Folks: Vladimir is 70 and considers himself a Russian Patriot. He is safe in a bunker surrounded by sycophants and has the nuclear hammer. He is having orgasms…he could not care less about human lives…he is Putin the Great, and back in the saddle. Absolutely NOTHING is going to deter him, he is safe sound and incredibly exuberant now that he is playing war.  The ONLY way he will ever backdown is if someone from his inner circle ⭕️ takes him out.
Well that was pointless. "They will end the war if their demands are met" yes tell me what the demands are lol
Long live Ukraine forever.
Bullshit info
Conditions are what?
Erdogan will add even more fuel to the burning fire.
Tell Putin to go stuff his conditions where the sun don't shine
Wtf!!! What are Putin's conditions?? What a lousy report. Shouldn't you be stating the conditions?? No point watching this channel
Dictator is dictating the Free world is Laughable .... time to check bluff of thug Rulers
they never said what the terms are..
Turn off the light for that maniac He is the worlds dangerous man 👹
I used to admire European culture and smarts but now i can see they have turned, the entire continent, into the most blind and stupid bunch in the human race, There they got a guy holding the biggest pile of weapons in History, a pile of nukes that could wipe their entire countries in less than five minutes and yet they keep spitting in his face, they keep disrespecting him just because they dont like him. If they keep at that they wont have the chance to regret it ALL THE MAN ASKS IS RESPECT, MAROONS.
Ukrain should stop fighting and let Russia take over the country! This guy think he is talking to dumb!
Thousands and thousands of javelin missiles and stinger missiles which are contributing from the neighboring countries will ultimately reduce Russian tanks and aircrafts as Ukraine will execute a querilla warfare tactics embush... put Russia invasive energy at peril 😆 Putin is realizing how he  failed in the 80s afghan war when America's stingers are deployed..
Hhhahaha sort of... I will stop punching your face if you stop covering it.
Man Putin has a 1million dollar bounty on him right now from a business man. Why ain't nobody going after him trying to assassinate him.
My condition to end the war: Die food so I could eat you...
What’s the demand?
Click bait worst news the world has to offer
Every bullet fired takes a life and a pray prayed saves life so let's pray together for peace in jesus name amen
Isn't that how wars continue? Putin says "Surrender, and be in our control" , Isn't that Why He invaded?      So, it's " Surrender or we keep killing you",  meaning , give us everything we invaded for, or we will invade until we get everything we want anyway.
I fully agree with President Putin and fully agree with Putin demands
WioNN the nest CNN 🙄  because they using CNN strategies and headline titles
Oh okay, if counties give in to his conditions,  this means PUTIN got his way, ruled the world and will use the same manipulation over and over again and most of all, this is his strategy to see and to test how other counties will react to his invasion. Continue the economic sanctions, even if he won against ukraine, his country and people including military forces will suffer economic devastation,  hunger, inflation, economic collapse to the point that they can no longer sustained and rebuilding their weapons. Ban all business, trades, metals, stop buying oil products from Russia. Save all that business to rebuild Ukraine. Remove all russian products in the international market,  including medications, hospital supplies made in the US, Europe and Asia.
You think u can start a war kill and destroy a bunch of lives and then ask for peace the next week ? Oh nah
So many people die and just like that putin stop the fight where is your dignity and freedom for the souls of people who died fighting for freedom of ukraine
stop fighting？？？？？？no way！！！！！
That terms and conditions America will decide for Ukraine 🇺🇦
Unbelievable... He only wants Ukraine to give in 😡  because so far the Russian military had not stopped firing
What the demands?
Ezekiel 38..here we go
Putin is crazy. He should take the army away. Ukraine is a free country. Is over 1milion men who want to fight for Ukraine. Does Putin knows what's gonna happen if 1milion of men will come to Russia? And do this same what he did in Ukraine?
What the hell are the demands geez change the title if you can’t give information
Putler can start hiding,  when Ukraine invades Russia he will have problems
stop it dont shake his hand walk out he needs to be taken out of power and tried for his crimes
Peace Peace  No war No war WORLD NEEDS PEACE  Heeled the world  God bless you all human Race
Putin the sociopath/ psycopath is trying to play everyone. He is not only trying to seek approval from the World that his actions are justified. He is disobeying ceasefire conditions. He is also not willing to negotiate  whilst destruction of Ukraine continues. Now he is using a friendly Intermediary which is a NATO country = Turkey to negotiate on his terms only. He must be told Negotiate on mutual terms at best and the destruction of the Russian invasion forces must continue because Russia is playing everyone. Increased force must be used against Russia to disable all invading vehicles and hostile personnel
This is not even a story if you cannot tell us what those conditions set by Putin are.
How unreasonable and unjust that Putin should make  such unrealistic demand from  Ukraine, when it is the Russian army that started the war and unleashed indiscriminately its Hitler barbaric attacks on Ukraine. Ukraine has all the rights to defend itself. It is Putin that must halt the attacks on Ukraine and get out of Ukraine's territory. Indeed, president Joe Biden was correct when he started: " I looked Putin in the eyes and told him, he is cold blooded killer". Even to this day Ukraine did not fire a shot or missile at Russian territories. The European countries and the West love the Russian people. The Russian people also love the European countries and the West too. It is the policies and actions of Putin that the European countries, the West and most Russians resent. Putin has lost the opportunity to make Russia one of the greatest nations and his legacy second to none... A word to the wise is sufficient.
What a load of CRAP !
I thought she said "Most schools" demands are met!
Putin is experiencing mental fatigue for asking Ukraine to stop fighting when he was the one that started the fight which himself has not stopped. Putin's end will be destruction to himself and he will end his life in painful way. He will end like Hitler did and hus grave will be unmarked in Russia.
Sob poooooo tin  We love Ukrain.
Puck-kin demands a independent country stop defending itself from an invading army before he stops invading, murdering women and children, in the context that his massive  army and country, fear Ukraine will invade. What piece of bull shit, he believes any buddy who believes that, is an idiot, or as stupid as Puck-kin is.
Be proud of our planet always ❤
This wounded man-child doesn't trust and he cannot be trusted.  At present, he has said nothing about the 'conditions/demands'; only that Urkraine stops fighting? This is insulting and gaslighting at its best. This is jedi mind tricks. He is playing chess and expects Ukraine to play checkers on his game board? His mindgames are disturbing and dangerous.
Don't trust no one but Jesus
Putin the real hero 😍😍
So this is the fastest growing refugees situation in the world,  since world War 2???? Very interesting and how convenient.  Please which world are they talking about here? Europe's World? Or the whole 🌎  plus Middle East and Africa??🙄🙄😫😫🚶🏾‍♂️🚶🏾‍♂️🚶🏾‍♂️🚶🏾‍♂️🚶🏾‍♂️🚶🏾‍♂️
she said same thing again and again but never said whats the demand   🤣🤣🤣
Putin started the war so he basically want Ukraine to surrender. Ukraine have the right to defend themselves. Dictator countries leaders are no better than Hitler. Same ideology.
Atlast the chance of Peace Prevailing in Ukraine.Hope everything solves out peacefully, Aameen.
So what does Putin want? You forget? Don't know? Again little to no information about what your covering.😐
So basically if they surender and give him what he wanted without a fight lol. Tighted the sanctions until he pops.
And the demands are?????? Wtf kind of breaking news is that when you don’t even know?
👍🏻
Confused.... The invasion attack Ukraine, why the Ukraine needs to stop fighting.... Where is the logic when you are being attacked in your own place?
Just agree for god's sake
Putin does not have any say over sovereigns nation!!!
Putin's ego, mindset, previous behavior and cannot afford to be overturned for his own safety, means he will NEVER back down, at the expense of the world - the Russian people are oppressed and denied any truthful information about what Putin is actually doing - he cares not even for his own people and less for anyone else.
🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
First you trespass your neighbours property and assault him. When he fights back and hits u hard, u then set conditions to end the fighting  u started. What planet are you from Sir Vladimir?
*Putin says:* _"We will stop fighting if Ukrainians surrender and give us their country"_  😂 🤣
Get the real news to the Russian citizens they are only seeing when Russian hitler wants them to see  🙌🙌
All the way to the free Europe from neo-Nazi
How did you speak for 2 entire minutes without saying a single thing?
Erdogan the terrorist funding alqaida killing Kurds in Syria advising others
THIS IS ALL FAULT OF THE UKRAINE PRESIDENT, TOO AMBITIOUS AND HE PUTS ALL THE COUNTRY INTO WAR 👎👎👎👎👎 HE IS USING BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES AND THE NATO GROUP..
No one can trust putin, not even his own people!!
What are the demands ? Are they any different? The report is a total "nothing burger." No doubt they involve replacing Zalensky with a puppet like most of the Western presidents and turn the Ukraine into a reliable buffer state like Belorussia. Let's see how serious Putin is about going into the Baltic states and attacking Poland. That will definitely start WW III. Perhaps 1939 is not as far in the past as we think  History does repeat after all.
Only modi
They should have a ceasefire on both sides, then Putin should remove his troops.
Don't believe anything the media says until it's out their mouths
Im going with what Gen Patton said long ago about the Russians. I dont trust them
How can anyone shake that man's hand. I would wash mine with holy water after.
LOL @ Putin repeatedly begging Ukraine to stop fighting. Trust me, they won't. The rest of us won't either.
Mystery Demands.......
0:39 my guy really went in for a fist bump
Enough of western sneaky games....Go Putin 💪🏻
Half news 🙄
Where is modi with 56 inch chest ??
Democraty, people have voice, but you  Putin, cant understand it. Or let people have voi e. Is it nice to be mad.
Putin started the war he should not be dictating conditions for ending the war. He is a war criminal and should withdraw immediately from the Ukraine. Then when he has agreed to the reparation's needed to rebuild the Ukraine we can discuss the full terms of his surrender including turning himself over to answer for war crimes against a sovereign country.
1:15 poor Putin
does  anyone know if this news channel is legit? dosent seem like it is....
What are Putin's demands from Ukraine
I wish one day India is powerful enough to carry such military operation on Pakistan. 😂
🤣 stop fighting the rape let it happen! Then the rape will stop after you stop fighting the rape. So stupid.
So Russia will stop fighting if Ukraine surrenders to all their demands? Isn't that... like the default assumption in any war?
The problem he's a massive liar and can't be trusted. He has no honour.
Just like trump.... PUTIN. Needs to be PUNISH ... IN JAIL..TO SAY THE LEAST...DISCONNECT RYSSIA FROM THE WORLD....
Who is Putin to put condition.he is invander and killer
Well that was an enlightening 2 minutes NOT 😂
Zero info
If Ukraine stop fighting??? Lol
Why would Putin in bade Ukraine there must be things we don’t know It doesn’t make sense
What the hell are the conditions?
That a sick man can risk destroying an entire humanity is inconceivable.  Someone has to get rid of Putin.
End this.
A peace agreement ( 7 years?) An orchestrated conflict however you look at, all wars are orchestrated and are banker wars.
Moscow's demands!! Putin has so much innocent blood on his he will not be able to bare his day in front of his Karma because God works in mysterious ways. If he's a religious man he thinks he'll be forgiven for all these innocent unnecessary deaths.
I totally agree all Conditions of Mr.Putin his  condition.
Puttin thinks god !
The aggressor setting "conditions." Such nonsense. He has killed 100's, and on top of that, he has conditions? The entire world needs to put a stranglehold on Putin. He needs to pay dearly and swiftly.
So Russia will stop after Ukraine surrenders
Atay strong ukrine don't listen putin demans
bruhh moment
When this dictator is going to meet his waterloo and also Mussolini and Hitler. Fed up seeing the poor people of both countries and the bloos shed this mad man is ordering. weeping on hearing the deaths of numerous ladies old people children over and above the army personnel. This madness and cruelty must stop at any cost.
Let the Ukrainian president move out of the country and the soldiers to cease fire so as to avoid more bloodshed and destruction. Let the that ruthless rascal Putin fight with the sanctions. Trust you me Russia is finished, the kind of sanctions at place is too much for any country no matter how powerful it is. It's now just 6 days after being in effect yet the ordinary Russians have felt the effects to an extent Putin the terrorist is terming them as war!
Putin is sick and is holding the whole world as hostage....he should be treated as a terrorist!
This is clickbait 😒
🇷🇺♥️
Putin guaranteed Ukraine’s independence in exchange for Ukraine giving up the Soviet nukes. Herr Hitler’s guarantees guarantee nothing. “Lay down your arms and we’ll talk”  Give Ukraine 20 Predator 2 drones and this will be over in a week
Time to stop talking. Ukraine will never stop fighting and putler will not give in. There is no easy resolution for this im afraid.
Putin...go to hell
WIFE BEATERS UNITE!!
Civilians died and these old men just sit comfortably
Nato - USA.... just sign the **** paper send it to putin ...... No Nato Ukraine is the only way to End this War Democraticly! That what u dems want No? ..... he has his point with the missiles  in Mexico at USA! 🤦‍♂️ someone tell him Maria's popping Missiles left right with different Gunners 🤣...... USA ****ed with this Migrants s*** anyway. 😂 Maria Maria 🤦‍♂️🤣🤣🤣🤣
When a DICKTATOR sets "conditions" in order to Cease Fire, Especially DICKTATOR like Putin, this means NOTHING. It's Bullshit. DICKTATOR will never cease fire All the way. Hitler Never Ceased Fire until he himself was at a mercy and of course committed suicide.
"Ukraine must stop fighting and meet Moscow's demands" -- is that because Ukraine is whooping Russia's ass in one of the biggest underdog fights in modern history?
I STAND WITH UKRAINE.
Jesus love you, he died on the cross for you, accept him as your lord and savior he can change everything. For God so loved the world that he gave his only son, so that everyone who believes in him may not perish but may have eternal life" (John 3:16)  But you must repent too. From that time Jesus went about preaching and saying, Let your hearts be turned from sin, for the kingdom of heaven is near. (Matthew 4:17):
why USA, Germany,UK, French can put sections ? who gives them right

SPECIAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS SHOULD NOT BE REMOVED FROM RUSSIA AS LOND AS IT HAS CONDITIONS TO END THE ENVASION OF UKRAINE.  RUSSIA SHOULD VACATE CRIMEA TOO.
Russia: We will not stop unless our demands are met.  Rest of the world: Are you going to tell us those demands? Russia: No
somebody  in  russia  please  take  this  nutcase   out  ....even  if  it  mean  sacrificing  your  life  for  the good  of  the  russian  people  and  the  world....i  would.. if  i  was    in  his  circle..
Putin is insane. His own people close to him will bring about Putins demise. He's People will bring charges against him. Him and his Generals will not make it to the Hague.  Russia will be set free to chose new leadership who believe freedom with respect and respectful order will keep people strong.
UKRAINE SHOULD  GIVE ATTENTION TO  AND DISPEL THE GENUINE SECURITY CONCERNS OF RUSSIA. 'IF IT HONESTLY WANTS TO COEXIST AMICABLY WITH RUSSIA AS AN INDEPENDENT NATION .
Putin Pipe dreams.
Oh nice reporting??
Dictator Putin cannot be trusted. He lies. Biden and the Democrats cannot be trusted. They lie.   Biden and the Democrats are aiding Dictator Putin. Using the force of government Biden and the Democrats are blocking the production and distribution of oil in the US. This is causing the global price of oil to skyrocket. The increased price of oil is providing HUGE profit windfalls for Dictator Putin. The oil profits are funding Dictator Putin's war. Biden and the Democrats are willing to sacrifice the lives of Ukrainians in exchange for their architected higher oil prices because it forces Americans to cut their consumption of fossil fuels. Biden and the Democrats have bought into the cult of fascism and controlling the means of production (not owning the means of production) is how fascists socially engineer their people. There are degrees of tyranny. Dictator Putin is a maniacal despot. Biden and the Democrats present a kinder and gentler form of tyranny.
Russia: “we’ll stop only if you roll over and let us do what ever we want…” Ukraine: the nearest cliff for you to jump off at…
Ukraine to stop fighting? Why? Who went there without provocation?
Ukraine, do not let this man dictate the conditions. He invaded YOUR country. You tell him what you want.
Putin always moves like a very inconfidient person ...i am really sorry for russians to choose and be in fear of such a miserable person !
And What's Gravitas + ?
putin knows that ukraine is as far as he can go so he is using the nuclear deterent as a means to keep the west out of it. he has probably figured out that his forces are not up to the forces of the west if he goes any further west. the sanctions should be more and the hell with his gas and oil. there are other countries that would gladly serve europe. hold on ukraine. the bully may get a taste of his own medicine from his own people.
What was Putin said exactly??
hopefully it will last longer than 30mins this time .
I honestly think US should attack Russia and show them who is the BOSS.
It is genuine demand and bold announcement by Russia
WION - The Dictator In Charge at the Kremlin is laughable, why would anyone agree to anything the Terrorist Putin demands or wants.  The Russians through Vladimir Putin have failed to observe any prior national agreement with his continued insistence that Ukraine is a state of Russia.  It is not a State of Russia; it is a free and independent country, recognized the world over, and he is engaging in war and committing war crimes for which he will pay for in his own personal blood.
Bloody   What are Moscows demands?
Why is Putin even talking to erdogan? That is like talking to the eternal leader of Mavrukush island?
Why is he smiling like everything is ok he is annoying typical Libra with that smirk and narcissistic ways smh
Russian hitler really is needs to be dealt with 😵🔫
Uraaa.. putin rusian hero..uraaa👍🥰🥰🥰
Take it and run with it Ukraine don't get us involved please
The world needs to put little man in his place. even if it starts world war III. if you want blood you got it Putin. You got to draw the line for Liberty. It can't be no compromise or appeasement.
He wants the same thing, yet he got the answer before.
This was the weakest report I've seen from WION.
MDRrrrr Putin veut  que les ukrainiens arrêtent de se battre pour arrêter la guerre. Il ne le sait peut-être pas mais c'est lui qui a attaqué l'Ukraine. Il suffirait qu'il parte pour que la guerre s'arrête.
Give him nothing!!!
Dudes!! Chill out, they might tell the demands on their next vid upload.😆😆
Old men talking and young men dying.
Putin just askin for a open hallway to walk through
Have a dislike for this shitty reporting clickbait, you reiterated the same rubbish 4 times without saying anything. Which conditions were set?
Im surprised Putin remains so close to Turkey considering the main weapon slaughtering Russians and convoys is the Turkish made Bayraktar. It is such a legendary drone now, that the Ukranians made a folk song over/for it! 😂  (Yes I know it is owned and operated by Ukranians. But still Turkish made/supplied. Usually nations are not so friendly at that point, but hey: I guess Putin will take any friends he can get at this point considering he just ruined his poker games for the next 20 years!).
If Russia's demands are met... You didn't mention what those demands are.
invading others domain and demanding something . NO RESPECT!
No dont be a coward russia
If Putin does not cease fire on Saturdays or Sundays he will incur wrath of God.
UKRAINE IS AN INDEPENDENT STATE.  AND WILL NOT BE SLAVES TO RUSSIA.
Putin is getting the upper hand   He should not be allowed  to swallowed Ukraine , a sovereign nation. If this condition will be allowed other surrounding countries are done.  NATO has no power.  Of NATO has no power in EU,  China will be emboldened to carry on its ambition to  take over all sovereign  nations in South East Asia.!  Russia was the Aggressor .If it has to be .. Then . The Governance of US are only interested in keeping their jobs longer  to enrich themselves.   Bomb Moscow.
Putin will rot in hell with hitler for what hes done
Thanks for clearing that up.
Yet Turkey are sending the drones that have taken out so many Russian tanks and vehicles to Ukraine?.....
I support Russia ✌️
😎🚀🍄🚀🚀😈
Putin will declare war on the West over sanctions and insistence on NATO expansion. Either NATO gives up on expansion, or this conflict will undoubtedly wipe out humanity. Russia will not humble itself ... so someone has to give in. China is keeping an eye on it and in a world war it will be on Russia's side... and if it doesn't, it will benefit no one as everyone in the northern hemisphere will be eliminated. Then here in the south we will receive the deadly radioactive clouds brought by the climatic currents. This isn't fiction... they're already watching, but we don't know if they'll intervene. Sad what has become of humanity!
Waste of two minutes. “Specifically if Moscows demands are not met”… ok, what specifically?
He is the aggressor..he saying his victim stop fight while they kill them.. What kind of mind set is that..
Yes! Russia deserves Ukraine,  👏
Its like a karen neighbor asking you to surrender your house and live by their rules.
great , we will stop the invasion if you give up . sounds reasonable
Putin should shut and rule Russia alone instead of doing so much harm
Puck-kin is evil, a war criminal and he will be gone soon.
He’s losing , watch out for red dots Pootin
Is there any truth in Putin’s words?
Let me see...Moscow's demand for Ukraine to stand down surrendering to Russian military. Okay
Stop buying Coca-Cola Company products and eating at McDonalds. cause their still doing business in Russia and special forces should burn the candle at both ends  by aggressively attacking the 40 mile convoy at each  end causing a panic among the Russian soldiers and trapping  them like sitting ducks
Bulshit....don't believe his words at all.....
Always hearing about it demands but the Western media doesn't so what are the demands are they a secret from the rest of the world or is there something they're not telling us
In short, Putin wants unconditional surrender. If you were Ukraine, how would you respond? If Putin demanded that of India how would you respond?
Putin is agressor in this war! Putin army inside ukraine so he needs to stop first! I guess putin is lier! He is feeling resistance he wanted take ukraine for sure! He said earlier there is no such a plan to invade ukraine! What he did after that! We all seeing it
☮
Unreasonable conditions cannot be met. But Russia can be crushed.
Moscow isn't the aggressor. The west must amend its ways
Putin id showing himself to be more and more of an ass
What are Putin's demands?
Now Russian knew who are their foes.
But you cannot negotiate anything with people like Hitler or Putin....
He wants Ukraine  under communism rule
As soon as Ukraine makes the ceasefire Russia will slide into Kiev more aggressively without resistance. Don't believe putin
He’s lying.  His conditions are just stall tactics.
One more country  is  also  going to get  ruined  by  the  so called NATO  alliance under the support and  guidance of  US.
with out  the  russian  people  putine  in  nothing  ...so   let  the  people  decide ...or  are  the  stupid  like  their  leader  ...to  believe  this  nonsense  ....
Erdoğan..savior of humanity..1😛😛😛
You don't set conditions, Putin.  You showed the world what you really are.  It's too late for that.
Damage is done what's wrong with men in power you don't have to kill innocent to compromise but Gob bless let's hope it really stops 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
Please help lovely kids and helpless mammas and papas  Shame on the politicians who ignited this in place of having a dialogue for peace.  Common masses must understand this and should never allow their politicians to misuse the state power to crush others. Never send your soldiers to support any powerful country in the future.
Well said putin.
at least Muslims come forward for peaceful revolution 😌
Unconditional withdrawl from Ukraine including Donbass Donetsk and Crimea. World can see what a failure Russian army is.
The Reality is that you don’t know when your going to have to pack a bag and leave your home and country as war expands.
Nothing Putin says can be trusted.
puktin   the great    MUST BE SQUELCHED    NOW
SO WHAT ARE MOSCOW'S DEMANDS? How about you tell us instead of hiding them, mainstream media?
its simple president of ukraine beg to putin and the condition is not to  allies in nato as simple as that its just a secret meeting inbetween ukraine and russia
This poor old fool doesn't yet understand that he has lost this badly! Not just the physical war, but the mind war too! That's why now he even has to outlaw the very word "war", what a sad and pathetic little man. He must control his citizens very speech! Outlawing perfectly normal and legitimate words! What a silly old fool!  Putin, you are the laughing stock of the world now! We pity the people of Russia! You're arresting your own people simply for disagreeing with you! You are even arresting children! For the crime of laying flowers for their neighbours in Ukraine!  Putin has officially lost his mind, I'm very sorry for both Ukraine and the good Russian citizens!
Indians parroting the Putin line. I just unsubscribed to this channel.
Why not mention the conditions?
You are the wors news channel ever.
Russia isn't calling the invasion anything. Pootie is calling the invasion something, something absurd, as if what he calls it somehow changes the reality OF it, and the ONLY acceptable end for this war is for all the invaders to be sent back in body bags, at least the ones targeting civilians, or to leave of their own accord.  I expect the demands from Pootie will become less and less demanding as we go along.  Funding this war is only making himself and his country the equivalent of North Korea, both in stature and military capabilities, and he KNOWS this.    Look at his face now in every picture and it is bright red.  He looks as if he's either been crying, or is about to.  He also looks the utter and complete fool, to almost the entire rest of the world, and a vicious war criminal, and he is painfully aware of this.  I don't think even his own self believed lies are doing it for him right now. As for his future, a bullet between the eyes would be appropriate.   Maybe the Ukrainians should send back released prisoners, especially the ones he lied to and deemed cannon fodder, with that suggestion, that they reach out and touch Pootie, that skin covered piece of excrement waste of space.  I say none of this in hate, just as a matter of course logical path that will prevent it happening again for a long time to come.  The real shame, beyond what he is doing to the Ukrainians, obviously, is what he is doing to his own country and his own people.  Just one more maniacal political moron with delusions of grandeur, and no brains and apparently not a lot of brawn to back it up, your typical playground bully, with unfortunately almost complete power in his country to carry out these destructive and heinous actions.  Delusions that are shattering all around him, at the moment.  I know, tell us what you really think, John.
What conditions if there any.
Rascal Erdogan was never so concerned about kashmiri pandits or hindus massacred in Afghanistan, pakistan and Bangladesh........
not now but in the future Putin will be a looser leader for taking the lives of not only Russian soldiers but also for Ukraine soldiers.
So what are the conditions?
More than likely they lay down their arms and do not join nato and have a  pro Russian goverment
Mr. Putin will want to set up a puppet government. I do not know what the protocol is if Mr. Zelenskyy resigns, but someone from his administration should take his place and all other government officials should be allowed to remain. The only difference should be that they give up their hope of joining NATO. Since that was the thing that Mr. Putin found intolerable, this solution might work. The Ukrainians have shown that Russia cannot treat them as a vassal, so they are able to state conditions, and it is time to adopt a different model for how to behave toward an immensely productive buffer state.
Turkey and Erdogon...👍🙏👏🙏🙏 PM Modi demanded a ceasefire too..a week or more ago.  They should be commended. They HAVE to deal!!  Thats it.  There's no other way out but to hammer out the peace and GET NEGOTIATING!! FINGERS crossed for Ukraine and everyone!!!
notice this vid shows "file" at the top. Again nothing current. Where did WION come from?  Answer : Its website was launched in many countries as a free-to-air satellite service on 15 June 2016 The founder Rohit Gandhi and editor-in-chief,[7] Mandy Clark, former CBS correspondent,[8] and Mithaq Kazimi, American media executive,[9] as managing producers respectively. Known journalists included Saad Hammadi, Bangladesh bureau chief and former correspondent for The Guardian,[10][11] Archith Seshadri, former CNN anchor,[12] and Tathagata Bhattacharya, former editor of the CNN web edition. ---- Yeah all makes sense now.  "From an Indian perspective"... right.
They will abide by these conditions like they allowed a cease-fire for civilian evacuation. Putin is a liar and a snake. He is the antichrist.
No war please
How about the Muslim migrant due to u just wars. Hypocrisy is showing it’s face u fortunately. But everyone will have to answer for their own actions
Erdogan is kind of useful in this conflict.
putin want ukainian wheat
This was click bait, wasn’t it?
He's looking at Finland and Moldova next.
Spoiler alert. Russia doesn't want to pay any more oil transfer fees to Ukraine for oil pipelines. Russia considers Ukraine as their province and doesn't think they have to pay. The end.
It appears that every news station around the  world is CNN by misleading the viewers.
WION please convey this msg to Putin..... Beware the ide of March (Shakespeare)
Does anyone see the situation in Ukraine, as a mirror of Hitler invading Czechoslokia? That Sniffin' Joe, is a repeat of Chamberlain? I'm glad the Ukrainians are holding up against Russia. Even if Russia succeeds in capturing Kyiv, they will be busy with an armed populace for a decade, reinforced from the West. It seems that many Russian soldiers don't want to be there in the first place. It's hard to win over a determined defender, even with superior firepower, when the defender will fight to the end. That's why Hitler never invaded Switzerland.
So what did you say?
Great news!!! Wait...what?
Nothing worthy of a news.
I can’t believe people are still willing to shake Putin’s hand! Arrest that criminal ‼️‼️‼️‼️
What are Moscow's demands?? This report just makes more questions!
He is already scared due to his convoy is not able move forward
He threatened nuclear war. This man is not all there or just plain evil
And we're suppose to believe what comes out of his sewer mouth?? Oh  just like we can beleive his little puppet donny and now ronny!! Right!!! Go Joe Biden tighten the sanctions 💪💪💪🇺🇸💪🇺🇸💪🇺🇸 Go Joe Go!!!! The people are behind Joe Biden PRESIDENT OF THE USA GOD IS BEHIND JOE BIDEN BLESSING HIM WITH HIS GRACE!! When The President of the USA Does what is  RIGHT IN THE SIGHT OF GOD is a trickle down effect of THE ALMIGHTYS BLESSINGS🤲🙏
Why doesn't she explain what the demands are
Okay thats like a kid in the school yard walks up to you and starts beating your ass with a metal bar and tells you he'll stop beating you if you stop fighting back smfh wth?
I think maybe Ukrainians need to travel to Moscow or st Petersburg and maybe blow some government bldgs up. See how Putin likes bombs going off in his country.
Very soon now, the Most High Will Put conditions on Putin for entering unto  wherever it is he has worked si hard to get into.
Can you trust a madman who broke the Budapest Treaty? NO.
LOL 😆  "If Ukraine stop fighting, I will remove my troops." What a joke!
this satan cannot pay back the life of people eh kill so eh need to b kill....!!!
Do not accept Putin's demand. He will just buy time and prepare and attack again 8 years later. Only complete withdrawal of Russian troops in Ukraine including Crimea and pay reparation for war damages.. Putin doesn't have the leverage. The longer the war goes the worse it is for Russia economically and militarily.
We hope. Our hearts breaks everyday when we see families homeless and fear. God is watching above us in our every works it was recorded.
Just tell the d@m& demands !
And what are Moscow's demands again?  Total withdrawal of all illegitimate combatants from the Russian province of Ukraine?  That the Russian province of Ukraine must publicly disavow all current and further claims of sovereignty and acknowledge the sovereignty of Russia within Ukrainian borders?  That the Russian province of Ukraine must immediately and permanently recognise the sovereignty of the independent republics of Donetsk and Lugansk?  I say thee bollocks!
This video was useless
The west should understand, This is Russia 2022 not Soviet Union
What even are his demands
Screw Putin
This war is actually USA vs Russia. Ukraine is being used. USA should not make Ukraine a NATO ally that why Russia is angry. Russia is right
Erdoğan is great ..man of the century ..🤣🤣
Erdogan is a matured leader...
Let me guess first of Putin demand is money Second and third also money and the last one  Don't take the money in my pocket
Let the Russians starve until they get rid of putin, get out of Ukraine, and pay full reparations and damages. If they don’t want to play nice than let them suffer until they do.
go get him
Firstly, every country has the right to join   NATO or not. Putin can not expect the Ukraine to live subject to his decisions that is not his jurisdiction to make any call on. Secondly,  Putin cannot expect to hold "peacetalks" whilst still advancing with military aggression. What kind of logical reasoning is that? This guy is wrong on so many grounds that it is absurd to make any demands whatsoever. Ukraine made it clear. And I do not expect any country to bargain with terrorists. I stand with Ukraine. End of story.
India abstained.
Puketin  child killing animal pig
no let him keep fighting the war lol hes bleeding out
They are in no position to set conditions. They initiated this conflict, and the world will finish it with even more crippling sanctions. These will be imposed for a long, long time. Russians have a lot of rebuilding to do. They have many reparations they need to do before sanctions are even considered to be removed. One of them is to kill Putin!
Translation: I have a gun at your head so give me what I want. Oh, after you give me what I want, I’ll still keep the gun at your head.
Erdogan is a back stabber.
Men va bra se där om Ryssland kan överväga stoppa detta och att ta det lugnt och dra sig tillbaka. 😎🌿🌼🌿🌼✋✋ 👍.  Om det bara handlar om att Ukraina ska börja sluta så kan det bli bra trots den svåra tid med vad krig innebär..mvh Kent 😎👍🌼🌿🌼🌿
What if Ukrain will send a bomber to Russia and do what Russia have done to Ukrain???
Another  no doubt predicted winning by Putin ! Another war victim Ukraine has been set up by US !
Don' t trust Putin, Ukrainians
Stop Putin
Biggest refugee crisis since ww2 really 🧐🤦🏽‍♂️ smh
Well before the war nato was allegedly parking missiles on their border. Ukraine seems more like a sacrifice by NATO countries to further militarize their borders and turn Ukraine into a forward BoPs. The Russians certainly gave Ukraine time to evacuate before fighting started. Any holdouts in Ukraine not inclined to fighting seemed like sacrifices for the cameras to show how terrible war is etc. Ie propoganda. Ukraine itself doesn't appear to have any real resource value so the fighting over it must be something else. Perhaps a main oil pipeline system for the east and west? Idk enough about the geography to make that assessment.
Don't quote dead people.
India does not Condem Russias invasion
That will be another condition of Putin which are lies for him to end the invasion. If Ukraine stops fighting them, Russia will takeover and control Ukraine easy without any expenses!!              On the other hand, I hope the West will never lift up the sanctions against Putin UNTIL not the invasion ends BUT 1> UNTIL Putin is strip as Russia’s leader and be replaced by one democratically voted by all Russians 2> Putin is prosecuted for his crime against Ukraine 3> Russia pays damages inflicted on Ukraine!!!!
Be careful. These Russian conditions are tricky. They say Ukraine stop fighting first, while they stop fighting the Russian troops could further advance inland. It is important to tell Putin that when Ukraine ceases fire, Russian troops should immediately draw back and not take advantage of the ceasefire to gain any inch of territory in the name of “peacekeeping”.
Bekar main itna pitai kia
PUTIN CAN GO TO HELL HE IS A DICTATOR AND A WAR CRIMINAL AND NEEDS TO BE DONE AWAY WITH BY THE RUSSIAN PEOPLE AND THE RUSSIAN MILITARY. RUSSIA IS NOW SLIDEING BACK TO AN ECONOMY THEY HAD DURING SOVIET UBION TIMES. I FEEL SO SORRY FOR THE RUSSIAN PEOPLE LIVING IN FEAR OF THIS MAN.
Iden will not do any thing !!!!!! HUNTER AND JOE MADE MILLIONS THERE !!!!!!!!
Little Napoleon has the audacity to make demands while violently breaking into someone else’s house. Putin is a psychopath and a serial killer.
Both country make angreement to remove most if not all corruption in government or those with controls to government.  That should be the goal to peace.
What conditions...
If you're not going to give us any new details, or any details at all about the demands for those who don't know them....at least take off your top and do some jumping jacks.
He has been doing it for years nobody listened
Hes not in any space to set any goals he must get out and stop his bipolar action
King of the North Russia, King of the South USA.
Btc atleast tell what the demands are !
Ukrainians clearly know there history including Russia staving them to death under stalin. History is repeating itself. I understand putin's concerns. But ukraine is not not a member of NATO. And it might be if Putin carries on.
Rubbish news
Your saying the same thing over and over and what your saying is NOT news. Your like the person that comments and says "I'm first"...
The world leader's, are trying to deal with a normal man... they need to take a quick course on people, who are psychopath's... and how to deal with this type of individual and then do so accordingly or not.  Putin, is crazed man, that's use to getting what he wants and when he wants!
The only way it would make sense for Ukrainians to stop fighting would be if they had invaded Russia. Since Russia has invaded Ukraine, it would be madness for Ukrainians to stop fighting back.
Views badhane ki ninja technique
That sounds just like the dictator he is!
Yes.. Ukraine should stop defending itself and give over its sovereignty to Russia. "rolls eyes"
Sad putin will have the world at his feet. He knows it. I wouldn't trust him as far as the eye can see. Scary
Fkn clickbait
Wtf was that reporting? Unsubbed to this garbage
Completely disarm your country, don't worry, Russia will take care of you once your our puppet state.
The whole world has communist idiots in charge !
But to end sanctions has conditions to change regime in russia
I’ll tell you what de demands are. More like what the demand is. Is only one. Putin will stop the war only if Ukraine will totally submit. The comi asshole don’t don’t wanna compromise nothing and unless he gets it all his way he won’t stop unless he gets stopped. Unless all the governments of all countries understand that and come together the war will never end.
Click bait
...in other words, the same thing he said before... He wants demilitarization (a surrender) so Putin can finish his 'special military operations" like he has done in other seized areas.
NATO put Ukraine to all this. Watch, Ukraine never be in NATO unless magic happens.
Here goes Turkey, about to be the new super power country.
Now the DICTATOR give condicions🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
You syop because one of your spy have been cought.
We do not negotiate with terrorists....
Russia is funny with Putin. How can Ukraine stop fighting when they are the ones who are being attacked. Does he want them to fold their hands when bullets and missiles are flying over their heads?
So, Russia will stop fighting if:  1.  Ukraine stops fighting, AND 2.  Ukraine gives Russia everything Russia wants.  Excuse me, but that does NOT sound like an offer ANYONE would accept! Lol
Putin took out the US bio labs and money laundering banks. That was his plan all along. Now our Career politicians want be getting kickbacks thru Ukrainian oil and Uranium 1.
RUSSIA POWER IS RIGHT TOO SLAP DOWN THESE SICK MINED HUMANS.  RUSSIA POWER SHOULD KEEP AND CONTROL THE BLACK SEA AND ALL PORTS BUILDED THERE. UKRAINE MUST NOT HAVE THIS RIGHT AGAIN. THEY HAVE FOOLISHLY CAUSED THIS WAR WITH RUSSIA POWER.
It is good news because there is hopes of a resolution arising out of it that could end the conflict and set in  the life of normalcy in both sides !
Gotta luv Turky playing both sides.... How they ever get into NATO lol
What demands? He knows he screwed up and doesn't have a clue about what to do.
Yes, as an Indian we support 🇷🇺Russia. And always will because no matter how close our relationship with America is. He is not a trustworthy partner. We as an Indian never trust America. And majority of Indian agree with this.
The demands of a rapist to allow penetration, is exactly what Putin expects of each nation.
The conditions set by Putin would be no different from asking the Ukrainian to surrender and give up their freedom of a sovereign country.
Please gave what he wants!!! So that the world will be save. Compromise few conditions for the safety of billions of people around the world. No to WAR.
Let me see now, you invade their country destroy their  buildings murder hundreds of their people, men women and children,  and now you want to dictate peace terms. Ok, and the whole world will just forget about the bombing, the invasion the murder of women and children, and the war crimes...right???...
Ukraine is illegal . Must surrender to its father Russia
what did that American say at the bridge again, oh yeah, i remember, "NUTS", that's the reply to Putin. nothing else.
Putin keeps all the vodka and borscht. And Britney Spears.
Wow Putin is really little
🇺🇦
What demand are meet you keep repaiting?
Ther are no new demands, he will just repeat the old demands.
He recently violated the rules of his own cease fire so how can we trust him NOT to KEEP A PROMISE??
Likh le ta hu kahi upsc mai sawal na aa jaya ✍️✍️
A thunderstorm never happens in a moment, it builds up a lot of ingredients and it has a traceable "history" before the thunder starts, the warnings about this current event are as old as 2000 or earlier, but now we only see the picture of one weaker innocent taking a punch from a bully, and it looks that the bully was NEVER provoked by the "saints", the hypocrisy continues and people are dying
Well done turkey 💪🏻💪🏻
Please end the war. Poor people are the one suffering
If Ukraine stops fighting?  lol it was Russia who went and invaded
So what are Moscow's demands? Talk of incomplete reporting w great confidence  U guys - Disappointing as always
Putin is a big a Liar as Biden, so you know what that mean.
Well Ide like to know what the conditions are ? Considering that there after right wing conservative folks my guess is there not Going to  stop tell all right wing folk around world have been sent to the camps !
No matter the outcome, Putin has damaged Russia for generations to come. This is a no win, no way, no how.
Putin should understand God power+ people power is much stronger than his military power....
I’m sure Ukraine will stop defending themselves just so Mr. Trustworthy Putin will withdraw 🤣
It's not up to putin to tell a sovereign country what to do.
RUSSIA IS TURNING INTO A NORTH KOREA!
But Putin said he would never invade Ukraine, so how did we get here. (Nazi-drug dealer)
Get rid of the Nazi government in Ukraine, and stop washing money for the U.S would be a good start.
Only a lunatic starts a war and calls it "Special Military operation" and also sets his own conditions to end a war he started as if he had nothing to do with it. He might trick his people to believe his BS, but those who went through his madness will never forget it, and will likely create hostility towards Russians in Ukraine and worldwide for years to come.
NO ! Adolf Putin can not have his way or the highway , NO! Ukraine's fighting is hurting Russia but Adolf Putin still wants his way or no way , sorry it doesn't work that way
Who will pay for the  loss of life and property in Ukraine?
I love Putin ❤️❤️❤️❤️😘😘
Ukraine 🇺🇦 must be back to half Poland 🇵🇱 and half Russia 🇷🇺. Second Poland 🇵🇱 and Ukraine 🇺🇦 government are Jewish
Putin's buddies are already complaining about their houses and yachts being confiscated.  If he doesn't at least act as if he's trying to stop the sanctions they'll soon get rid of him.  Either that or they'll have to make do with that dreadful Russian champagne instead of Dom Perignon. Ugh!
why does zelenskyy want a no fly zone?
Putin wants Ukraine, and biden administration said take it , make it look brutal 🙄?
painful to listen Indian people speak English .
Putin is trying to digest a Porcupine -- no conditions and expect the West to establish a no-fly zone in western Ukraine, if not all of Ukraine.
imcomplete reporting..what are the demands?
His word is worthless
And I'm guessing because I got this video on pause that maybe also part of his conditions or that Ukraine just hand themselves back over to Russia and that's not good that's not cool at all
Stop fighting ? STOP INVADING
What a minute to late , the guy has already lied , and Ukraine agreed during the invasion to compromise all Putin has to do is back of and go home !  Unless the Medea is lying, Russia is going to feel a world of pain!
CLOSE THE SKY OVER UKRAINE!!! These fools will definitely hit one of our nuclear plants!!! And it directly affects you all.
Putin: the worse case of small man syndrome the world has ever seen.
Nato will pay every life they took,for every child they killed,for every women ur soldiers raped,for every home ur armys razed,for every war crime u did  u will pay in blood
What are the demands?
But if Russia pulls out now won't the leaders on their way to Europe to save the day (why couldn't they stay home and facetime if the world is buggered for oil and prices are soaring?)  have to stay home and deal with the Pandora's box they created with the covid pandemic? The Russian president could end the careers of the western politicians by being the better man , ending the invasion and sending the 'leader's ' back home to face their taxpayers with their tails further tucked up their backsides.
I dont trust Thats dude either.hes been holding onto power anyway he can, and he really has been the red headed stepchild of the NATO alliance not being on board with sanctions.
WHAT demands?  This reporting is completely worthless.
NATO has made   14,500 dead in Libya  165,000 dead in Afghanistan 224,000 dead in Syria  1,200,000 dead in Iraq.  It didn't shock anyone. None of these countries has been sanctioned.   Russia starts a war in Ukraine and leaves barely 200 mostly military dead that everyone is shocked and trend.   Does NATO has a moral grounds to rebuke Russia?
Ukraine demands to russia: rebuild Ukraine like it was before.
So, to sumit all up, Putin the pukehead) won't stop unless Ukraine stops fighting for their freedom and gives in!!
It would be so easy to stab Putin in the throat being that close to him. Damn!!!!!
What are there demands?
you say nothing.
I’m just SO GLAD the world hates Russia right now!  We should destroy them forever.
what are moscow demands?? what kind of news is this?? so lazy
And what are the conditions???????
It appears the demand list is blacked out.  We can assume he wants Ukraine to not be part of nato, but what else?  Sure, some things may be closely held for negotiations, but there has to be more than one thing, seeing Putin seemed set on an alleged nazi problem.  I would expect certain weapons demands, but there may well be more.   A waste of video bandwidth...
What are the conditions? Useless news clip.
She's hot, lol
He statred it - he can stop it.  Keep the "they’re special economic conditions." coming I say.
He is losing day be day he is doing wrong no he wants to give up he’s people doesn’t like hem he is responsible for many lives Ukraine 🇺🇦 and Russia 🇷🇺 he kill both of them he’s on soldiers die no knowing what was going on because he fooled them big lies
WE SUPPORT GREAT PUTIN WE LOVE GREAT RUSSIA NATO USA = WAR CRIMINALS!!!!
This is not only NOT news, this podcast fancifies that Putin’s set legitimate diplomatic conditions. Putin’s made no such thing. Translation — “I’m taking Ukraine so just f-off.”
Putin’s conditions will never be met.
Putin must stand trial for war crimes
Some of the comments ive read are baffling 😵 I dont give a flying hoot what his reasonings are or his conditions none of it justifies killing all these innocent people, destroying all those families homes, scarring and injuring people mentally and physically for life. & shooting people trying to escape! Disgusting world we live in :(
putin = 💩
This means a peaceful resolution is impossible.
" MONSTER DOUBLE " VLADIMIR PUTIN.
It's called a war
The west should only stop when Putin is dead. We've overestimated him for too long.
Ukraine is fighting cause Russia is in the wrong lands so its Russia that needs to stop!
Appreciate this channel reporting news as it comes, guys wait for next bulletin
Russian economy on the brink of collapse, the ruble is worthless their stock market is permanently closed 🔒 great job Putin 👋
Just let us win and take the country then we will stop.
So it seems like to me Mr Putin starting to realize that he got into more than what he thought he was he didn't expect what he's gotten and he see how he looks on the world stage now so welcome to the shoes of the United States that was not asked to be done to us only our president did that in this country but what are your other demands if you say they need to stop fighting you need to pull back for them to stop fighting otherwise as long as they are being shot at they are going to shoot back that's called personal protection and they have a right to do so so if you serious about that how about you just go ahead and take your people back home that way they will definitely know that they should stop fighting but do not leave you some of your people hidden somewhere to start something else
Stop A Guerra,  Por Favor  Senhores Presidentes , Liders  destes Tempos sāo seres Humanos  inteligentes , Respeitaveis e Reponsáveis,  com poder de comunicaçăo  emensuráveis , capaz de  ver os prós e contras antes dos acontecimentos ,  também   com  olhar amplo de ver  as Coisas  com olhos de retitude e de tomar attitudes  recta e Pacifico.

Click bait - does not specify the demands.  Save your time
Thought I was going to hear what the conditions were yes.
"Merry go round"...the new media reporting style.
FREEDOM AND VICTORY TO THE HEROES OF THE UKRAINE !!!
Remember back in 2014 when ukraine army shut down MH17
✌️ on 🌎 Goodwill to men
Not my fault
Try telling the TRUTH, and this all ends.
So what are Moscow's demands??
Non negotiable for a killer
A condition to end the conflict is to stop fighting back? Wtf??
I didn't hear a single condition 🙈
Mabe the world leaders should give Putin demands get out or you will be stop and you will be the man that started world war 3 and your country will look like all the country that you destroyed
Putin acting like the invasion is in Russia is Putin dumb the Ukraine president suppose to be making demands!
Putin can make all the demands he wants, Ukraine is not going to back down or bow down to him again. They fought so hard in 2014 to gain their own independence as a country. Why would they back down now??
Putin is a cheater, liar, coward. He has no honor and has not honored his word nor agreements. Do not trust.
You call That Breaking News. To the Majority of the World that's Considered Common Sense.
Might help if you told us the demands
Hitler: ”I am the most hated man in history” Putin: “Hold my beer”
What are the conditions? Surrender all the lands east of the river running from Kviv & Odessa & lands to Lviv?   Time to order more TB2s, javelins, NLAWs!
What the hell was the point of this video? Your top story this hour was that Putin will end the war if............"WION is available in your country!!"
NOW THE FKING WEIGHT LOSS SCAM. STAY AWAY FROM THESE YOUTUBE SCAMMER MAFIA
Hitler old man,69years call for war but Younger innocents people will die.dictator Paranoid psychopathy Terrorist Killer corrupt Putin
He wanted Ukraine to stop fighting???? What about him ??? Continue his assault?????
Damn!!  Putin done all that just to get what he wanted? Fkr is really crazy. Bet trump told him how to handle things, I Guarentee u!!
What are the fucking conditions!?
Wow, repeatedly saying the same sentence but not a clue on what putin’s conditions are. Putin has always had conditions to end the war but was just unreasonable to nato and Ukraine
Yeah, l think president macron can resolve this.
So are we gonna keep spoiling him with his demands and jeopardizing our security? Let's not forget Hitler and WWII.
Nope, not getting away from Ukraine that fast.... You're a daisy if you do....
....Putin's request for peace is that Ukrainians stop shooting back and raise their hands up...
Thanks for the stringent conditions laid by Mr. Putin sir. Accept or bow down Mr. Zelensky.
Thank the Gods Putin's comrad Trump lost his power in USA because this would be so much worse. Trump dreamed of being a dictator and was doing everything in is power to destroy NATO and get in bed with all the evil leaders of this very fragile world..
Why don't we end Putin NOW!!!!!!!
Palki, hello.   nice to see you again.
Don't trust Putin
este señor , entro a desesperarse lo que el otro no la da bola.  asi de sensillo. nada mas.  SI!   ....SI!)
Putin has gone mad with the taste of innocent blood. He is nothing but a sadistic killer.
I didn't listen to the broadcast, just read the comments.  However, I correctly guessed before I read the comments, what he said:. "Surrender, or Die".
Putin is antisocial and narcisisstic. He needs psychiatric counselling and if indeed, admission to a psychiatric facility if deems necessasry
This looks like an untrustworthy source. Get info direct from source instead of this regurgitated “news” from reputable news outlets that have boots on ground. Ever play telephone? Greedy click bait “media” is a dangerous game when public officials might be influenced by sensationalist click bait. Just be weary of all media and take everything with a “grain of salt” because they’ll sink their hooks in for money.
He sense defeat?
LOL. NO WAY IN HELL will Stupid Putin stop. Its a smoke screen to flush out Ukraine troops and civilians.
The wolf will always blame the lamb. Russia's actions have only proved that Ukraine's fear was right.
The only reason Putin is still alive and not considered a terrorist is because he’s white
Thousands of his people going to die at some point in time is people just going to give up and go back to Russia and take him out
So he wants the UKRAINE to surrender to his demands, what a poisonous psychopath, WE STAND WITH THE UKRAINE, STAND STRONG AND NEVER SURRENDER TO VLADIMIR HITLER.
The irony is Russias demands haven't changed and frankly were not unreasonable.   Why should Ukraine be militarized.  Why should they spend 1 cent on military if they don't have to.  I would love if my country did that.
Without America’s former strength Putin will win.  He knows weak leadership when he sees it.  The US and other countries are funding Putin’s war by buying his oil.  Produce your own oil.
So “if Ukraine stops fighting”….against an invasion?   If Russia stops, there’s nothing to stop is there.  “Conditions”?   Errrrr….that would be called a reward for starting and stopping a war.   You don’t start a war then set conditions by which you will stop it.  Egads. I can see he is trying to save face with his people but unless the conditions are twinkies and root beer, I think they can sod off.  & even Hostess & A &W might object.
Putin sounds afraid
We will die if politicians do not stop provoking Putin! He has ready-to-use nuclear weapons in his hands.
Putin is great
Conditions are mentioned at :20 seconds
Russia is right and cunning USA and Europe should stop dirty games and world dividing  and destroying selfish and nonsense  policies thru UN, UNSC etc.
He’s a farce total barmcake
Russia is in no position to set conditions. It is a fascist aggressor on sovereign Ukrainian soil and must withdraw unconditionally!!!
Yes, MR PUTIN , THEY SHOULD  agree  with your DEMANDS and they should not make the same mistake
1:52 minutes of my time wasted...
That's it? This update was a waste of time....
Ukraine : "do we have terms" Russia : "we have terms"                "i will send you my physicians" Ukraine : "salamAlaikum" Russia : " walaykum salam"
Just stop the shooting.  Get to the negotiation table.   Get out of the Ukraine where you don't belong.
the conditions are they stop defending?... yeah, that makes total sense.    there is one peaceful solution to this and it starts with  B and ends with ullet in putin brain.
So what are Russia's demands? Gee.. so Ukraine has to "stop fighting first"? So what's is Russia's acknowledgement of this? more bombs?
Just a dictator
What conditions?
I support purtin.... Am from Sweden... US is full of shittt..
A True President knows the strengths and weaknesses of his own country and not relaying on the military support of other countries. If he really love and cares for his people he doesn't lead his county to war.  Zelensky is the president thus he is the one to blame! This battle only proves his desire to be a member of NATO prevails not the safety of his people.
Putin. Stfu. you lost any and all respect.
So I just wasted my time watching a menu selection option. What are the terms? You said you were gonna tell us.
As we know his so called conditions will continue to change as it suits him
Well one good thing coming out of this is that it will force nations to rethink how they see each other. The planet requires a more united world. It's okay to be proud of your country, state, area etc...but, we now need to move towards a unit of one rather than individuals.
So what are the Russian demands? You kept repeating the message with no content.
shouldn't the invading party halt first rather than expecting the defending side to stop fighting?
Not us aid ,it's money laundering
BULL CRAP!  MOSCOW DEMANDS ARE MET.      He's on the ropes...
Well that was a waste of time! Why does this woman have to shout at the camera?
What are the demands?
We the people of the world, wants to know what his specific demands are?
America not going to stop this war because the one who profited from this war is American companies.they are going to make billions from this war. Now every country going to increase their defence budget as we seen in Germany's defence budget.America wants this otherwise if he really don't want war then what America have to do is to give assurance to Russia that Ukraine will not become a nato member. This is as simple as that. But America is not going to do it they have to make billions and trillions from this war.
He also wants nato troops to withdraw from east Europe including nato countries. He knows no one will accept it. He will go all the way with Ukraine. To be honest there’s little gain from this operation, gaining a large chunk of territory or installing a pro Russian government is not worth destroying your economy and isolating yourself from the rest of the world. Plus they will need to deal with insurgents, even if Ukraine government fall, fighting will not stop. Very wasteful from a outside perspective.
Erdogan and Xi will carve up Russia after Putin fails and Russia collapses
What a stupid video bruh..you would expect they would say what conditions are.. This could instead of 112s last 12 sec..todays media
Can't tell us the demands ehh, kinda worthless reporting if you want my opinion
Let’s have cease fire  Ukraine 🇺🇦  Russia 🇷🇺  Peace negotiations
Putin is a war criminal and psychopath.
Putin's words mean nothing, only actions matter.
Demands Russia is hurting its taking to much damage.
George W Bush should be tried by International Court of Justice for war crimes in Iraq.   America bombed more innocent people than any other terrorist organization ever did .
Heather
Erdogan is a walking talking joke
Turkey who still illegaly occupies North Cyprus yet is still allowed to be in NATO!
Nothing will stop Putin from taking Ukraine!
Since world war II? I guess we forgot the genocides in Bosnia and the 100,000 dead there and in Kosovo?
Counter offer: The world gets Putin's head on a stake and Ukraine is rebuilt using Russian resources. Ukraine will remain independent and Russia will no longer be ruled by a communist dictator.
Sould be good demands from some how started war   my be he what to rebuild the country and go back home
so they'll stop their invasion if Ukraine stops fighting ... wtf lol?  That is the most genius/stupid thing I've ever heard.
Pray tell!  And don't bother to tell us, your audience, what those conditions are? Boom! Boom! Boom!  as this lip service goes on and on and on and on.  What kind of NEWS cast is this?  Boom! Boom! as the bombs continue to kill thousands of innocents.  Boom! Boom!
Putin is no place to demand jack. His invasion is a flop,his country is in tatters...screw him!
Russia must defit  the fascism of Ukrania.
I love wion so informative
PUTIN = HITLER.
WHAT ARE  THE FUCKING DEMANDS THIS SHIT IS WHY I DON'T WATCH NEWS
I think Turkiye is only country has who enough courage to stand up against the aggressor despite Russia being its one of the biggest Allies. India and Pakistan didn’t have the courage to do so!
Listen to both sides. Putin will keep his word. So will Turkey will as well. US not so much!
And what are the conditions? Thank you for a two minute video in which you said absolutely nothing and than repeated it…
Far too late to stop Putin.  Should have happened quickly.  Give it to him to save life vest and begin oilproduction in the US.  Biden is finding Putin’s invasion
Putin doesn't get to set the conditions. He's a criminal and a mass murderer.
MOSCOW IS NOT TRUSTWORTHY EVER !!!!! THEY SAID THEY wouldnt invade they did , they said there would be a humanity coridor cease fire, it lasted 3 hours and they started back... NEVER TRUST A TYRANT... PUTAN=POS
So basically he refuses to stop fighting
Give him what he wants and other bullies will rise up to do the same.
What are the conditions?   What a crap report. No info
So, the only real motive for Nato to ever hypothetically invade Russia is energy correct? Russia might be the last place where oil and natural gas remain in say a bit under 100 years.  With that in mind, can we just agree internationally to multiply fusion research and the deployment of other renewable energy sources instead of launching WW3 over it? I'm pretty sure WW3 is more expensive than the alternative. Just a thought, would make more sense imo but what do I know...
Tell Putin to come take these  idiots on Pennsylvania Avenue..... startin with Jill and Joe, Kamelti)
Nato needs to send Ukraine fighter jets. This will not expand the war.
The invader said I am so kind not to continue killing you! Ridiculous shit!
🇷🇺 VIVA RUSSIA 💖  🇷🇺 RUSSIA IS THE BEST 💗 🇷🇺 LONG LVE MR_VP💖 🇷🇺 GBU MR_VP ❤ 🇷🇺 UurRaaaaaaaaaaa ❤
Putin criminals never forget its massacres aut from ucrania the wold kills children crrecy
Since Syria FFS And Iraq
This video is a waste of time what demands
Putin is correct! Zalensky' chose war with Russia while his European supporters did not. Rather than abiding by Russia's demands he is acting defiantly lureing his population to fight with Russia. Zalensky' is actually making a spectle of himself hiding behind the camera soliciting help from falling European powers. Zalensky' need to turn to God for help and remove his population from the battlefield if he is really means well for his people. My question to zalensky' is, what harm would it cause to Ukraine by submitting to Russia's demands?
No limit to the man's arrogance!
Top notch reporting on those conditions, thanks for the insight.
Its a little to late.
Leave their country and they will stop shooting at you.
So....what are the conditions.
Russian just want to test their superior power and show up to Ukraine that even NATO or US will not help them directly while facing Russian...
Putin will only stop fighting if he receives an unconditional surrender from Ukraine
Hey Putin there was a peace agreement was signed with Russia already and Putin / Russia broke the agreement
Ukraine: we only have one demand.... get the fux$ out of Ukraine!
Waste of time watching this.
You give a mouse a cookie…
What are russias demands please ?
What are those conditions?
Keep barking with West needs Idian to fa China....let me see you alone Face China&Pakistan without the west 🤯
So what were the demand?  This was repetition.
"Our conditions to stop fighting are for you to meet our conditions to stop fighting" I feel so informed
Another thing I would like to know is where is the condemnation of this genocide by the heads of religious organizations denouncing the unprovoked attack of the genocide and the destruction of a people in Ukraine 2022?
Mad Man and murderer
What demands. Apparently best news channel. SMH.
Putin wanted war. Well he got one.
What are the demands
Obviously western country wants Ukraine to become libya
Now that Pakistni has all those American weapons, can they renew a war with India ?
Lame clickbait reporting....what are his demands?
Where is the news ?
Ukrainian People better stop letting the USA in the world sauce them up because there’s no way they can win they better meet rest of the man and everything will go back to normal for them but if not they will not be recognized as a state when Russia takes over
What are the demands? Cliffhanger news...
Mr Putin is why he's doing so evil 😭😭😭
WHAT are Moscow's demands?
What are the conditions?  what are the demands?  Why do you keep repeating nothing like it is something? If you’re out going to provide any more information than the thumbnail, what’s the point?  A story should contain some basics WHO, WHAT, WHEN, WHERE, WHY AND HOW.  After they are provided, and only after, you can add EMOTIONAL aspects.
This was all an act or play…this was no real invasion.  The result was decided before they “invaded”
If the Russians were smart,  they'd surrender all of their forces to Ukraine,  give Ukraine all if their weaponry, hand over Putin for a harsh prison sentence combined with slave labor, and become a state of Ukraine.
Putin lost this war
Generally like this channel for info but...no info was given in this video.  Putin puts conditions on ending the war.  Ok what are the conditions?  The conditions are Ukraine my comply with Russia demands?  Ok what are the demands?  The demands are the conditions that pitin has set....  Do better please.
why isn't any news channel showing us the demands that Moscow is making.
Evil people doing this!  Endangering the whole world!
2 minutes wasted
did they discuss any new demands. which demands did they talk about in their meeting. we didn't listen to their telephonic talks so we still don't know their demands.
So.....they agreed to allow humanitarian corridor and that lasted 30 minutes and they began murdering people trying to leave under that agreement.  So why should anyone trust his word????
Nothig said about the “demands”. Just filling time for a “news segment”.
Tyrant cannot negotiate only pushing his own demands.
You said nothing! Bait click
Russia wont last for another 3 months
Who wants to end this assault not the west good luck
People are losing trust in this pos channel due to these clickbait titles. But I guess this is typical of your country, seeing the pitiful state india finds itself in.
Those arent conditions.. saying surrounder or else has to go,,.all the good  are fleeing soon he will have no one to do his dirty work... difference, except one bides his time  for an opportunity to strike...like a pandemic.
Putin is cracking.
"we will stop murdering your women and children, and demolishing your country, if you become our lapdogs once again, allow our military unfettered access to your country at any time, do not self govern yourselves, and your foreign policy must be okayed by our dictator first" ... there, that about covers everything ... which parts are untenable? ... The lot? ... oh well, we'll just keep on committing our war crimes like "good "ole" Nazi's"
So Ukraine needs to stop fighting the invasion? Basically Putin’s demand is that they surrender…wow. I would like to know why is India is buying Russian weapons and abstaining in the UN Vote condemning Russia’s invasion?? This is very disappointing and surprising
Turkey 🇹🇷 has 0 credibility.
To agree to terrorist's conditions is to lose for sure. Russia is losing the war and this is putin's bluff to pretend like he is winning.
GOOGLE: Moscow's dema....
Moscow is hoping for the old “humping dog” strategy: don’t resist a dog that humps your leg; let him finish on you so he’s not upset.
For those people who was in hard getting to comprehend the acts of putin,  I'm inviting you to read my analysis. Here it is.... Putin wants to preserves its people and existence of being a Russian... Putin only request was to stop the influence of westerns to converting the former soviet union  member nation to be a democratic form Of goverment and pursuing to be a member of NATO. It that continue to happen NATO will soon invade Russia and will become weak nation and devided. I think US and its allies have to stop their action and plans for Russian people
What the demands? Not identified here, just “Ukraine stop fighting, and meet our demands”. Ok ... what demands?!?
Even the invasion end this man should be punish!!!
Nato will never agree!
We are waiting for PM Modi when 🇮🇳 reach in Russia.
The video does not provide the information claimed in the title
BUT PUTIN WS PLANNING TO INVADE MOSCO AN IS TRUMP  STOP HIM THIS MAN WANT TO CAPTURE AN KINCAT
Soo what are the demands miss?🤦🏻‍♀️
Putin has produced blood and tears in Ukreine , be strong ukreine , we stand for Ukreine
Putin has pushed every European country into NATO.  Nobody wants to ruled by Putin.  Informed people everywhere want to join NATO only corrupt politicians want to join Putin.  NATO member only want to join together because of Putin's aggression.  NATO countries can think for themselves, they are not controlled by the US.  US does have a say in NATO but so do the other countries.  Russia has imprisoned or killed anyone who thinks for themselves, good luck outthinking an enemy.
People she expect to she save humanitarian respect. Some times you need to obey what you didn't want, people are die properties are distroy.
There is no "conflict".  For there to be a "conflict" there must be two agressors and there are not.
Rascal you caused pain, still holding to condition? Hope you'll be brought to your knees soon.
so handsome
Putin can demand nothing. He is the instigator of this war, and he must be brought to the court of human rights. This man has killed innocent mothers and children with his dream of building back Russia to what is used to be. He has no morals, and he can't be trusted. If the West gives in to his demands, he will give ammunition to North Korea, Iran, China etcetera, to do what they want. Putin must be defeated militarily, and financially. Otherwise it will send a signal to all other dictatorship,that they can do what they like.  and all the other tin pot
You said it 100 times. What are the demands ?
THE AGGRESSOR DO NOT HAVE RIGHTS TO DEMAND OR PUT CONDITIONS ONCE HE IS BEATEN? HE WILL.INSTEAD THE FATE OF BEING THE LOSER! HE WILL. BE REMEMBERED IN THE LIKES OF GENGHIS KHAN, NAPOLEON, AND ALL EMPEROR WHO SUFFERED THE SAME FATE? BUT IN TODAY'S WORLD, HE WILL.BEVTRIED AS A WAR CRIMINALS TOGETHER WITH HIS GENERALS AND ADMIRALS.?
How can Ukraine stop fighting when they are being shot at. Do you wait for someone to come and kill you or fight back?
Putin wants Ukraine to stop fighting?  How about he simply leaves?  See.  He’s crazy.
So If Ukraine  troops stop fighting there Will be peace? Returnering home of russian troops Will do the same Not the biggest IQ from Putin
What exactly are conditions
Those are  not  sanctions  but  business  opportunities
Ukraine president was a puppet and fooled by American..
Ukraine literally means "Borderlands." This area will always been in dispute.
Putin should face justice for war crimes against humanity now.
Ukraine Damage .... Pay Mr Putin morethan your Life.....
Hope for alle the people and children in Ukraine, and hope for alle the demonstrators in Russia who dared to demonstrate and now face 3 to 6 years prison
the fighting will only stop, once there's a pineapple shove up Putin's bottom...
Wait... so the muslim 'refugees' were not refugees.... Hmmm, so was it an Islamic invasion?
rubbish reporting when what russian demands are never mentioned, not informative at all
half truth, what are moscows demands? Thanks for yet another video with no actual information.
Click bait. Nothing going on here. Move along.
Dude, you are asking people stop fighting back when you are invading there country for no reason?
Is Putin the big pig ? Yes !
The world says to Pootytang: KMA!!!  BOOM!!!!
This is the worst fucking reporting I’ve ever seen 💀😂 bruh please fire this bxtch
I guess we've all heard THAT before.  I don't let others pick who I am friends with.
If Ukraine stops fighting? They never fought in the first place until provoked!
Dislike
Putin should back off. Now go home before you lose more lives.
Putin must be feeling the 'heat' coming from the world's community
Give the child his toys back
putin want's to make all the rules after starting this war , he's a little sick prick
Next time maybe mention the bloody demands?!
How could Ukraine stop fighting if Russia still advancing and invading Ukraine? Its a deceitful demand of peace.
You can’t satisfy hitler, he’ll always need more- I mean Putin. I get the two confused because they’re so similar
Putin is a liar. His word means NOTHING.
Dear Vlad, it's time that you grew up!
Russia will stop fighting the second Putin is dead.
The end of american era.. Worst American president.
ok
That report did not contain any information except that two blokes had a phone conversation.
The more and more I read about turkey the more I believe they will bail on NATO the moment a country other than turkey gets attacked.
Ukraine will stop defending 😂😂
What are Putin's requirements?
So what is the conditions then?  Putin really think Ukraine will stop defending itself?
I would not meet any of your condition.  The US and the rest of the free world will put an end to your dictatorship once and for all.  You and only are the corrupt cancer in your once great nation.  If the Russian People  want to continue to live in a communist nation they will let you know.  But my take  is that would like to have a working constitutional government like much of the free world.  Your time has come.  You are a walking dead man. You just refuse to see that you and your sick reign is over.
Russia has made an enemy of the world Any one not boycotting Russia right now should be watched very closely.
Putin is the aggressor who ordered the massive invasion of Ukraine, therefore he should not be demanding the condition that Ukraine should stop defending their country which Russia has destroyed infrastructure and civilian buildings and killed civilians and caused a mass refugee crisis. Instead,  he should order his army to return to Russia so peace can be restored. This invasion will make the region very unstable. Countries have been preparing underground shelters for decades,  fearing a Russian invasion one-day.  Putin is duplicit and he can't be trusted.
What are the conditions---you did not say. How would Ukraine stop fighting when Russia continues to fight? It should be agreed upon day of ceasefire to start negotiations. Putin is driving a hard bargain because he knows the consequences of not taking Ukraine will be far greater. Putin wants the invasion to continue
One of their demands is the demilitarization of Ukraine, YEAH, never going to happen
Stalin had "conditions" for Ukraine too. Putin is the new Stalin. Slava Ukraine 🇺🇦 ♥
1 Thessalonians 5 : 3 For when they Shall say , Peace ✌️ and safety then sudden destruction cometh upon them , as travail upon a woman with child ; and they shall not escape .
God please help those innocent people and please end this war🙏
पुतिन कितने दयालु है। वो अभी भी शांति का प्रस्ताव रख रहे है। प्रस्ताव स्वीकार करने ही ठीक होगा।
Putin, how about you stop fighting so that Ukrainian will stop defending. Who's attacking who ?
He's acting like he's in a place to be demanding anything at all. What a joke.
making demands like a terrorist
Seems Sanctions are working and putin didnt have money and country support
So what are the demands?  Jesus.
Putin needs a brain and take him to a militar court.  Ukraine did not start this war Russia did. Russia needs to stop this war now and pay for all the damage they did to Ukraine and ask for no demands. The only thing Ukraine doing is defending their country.
this man is delusional, his enonomy goes down faster then a misile, rubla cheaper then the toilet paper, cards are just a peace of plastic.
End of war or not the sanctions should never be changed.
Who is putin to make demands to a sovereign nation?later he will demand the whole world to listen to him..a modern day Hitler
Now that Putin has lost the war he wants to negotiate. Too late little man.
What are the conditions? Simply repeating the same story
Turn off the Gas & Oil to Europe and Turkey
this muhfker actually thinks he could walk away from this thing alive.... how very humours of him... maybe this is some kind of russian humour
I don't know that anyone person or country can accept diplomacy at gunpoint. Without clear demands and I'm going to assume Putin's demands are complete capitulation from Ukraine. Seems to me the future of Ukraine ought to be decided by the Ukrainian people not by the Russian Federation not by NATO. All the bluster and rhetoric about going nuclear is insanity nobody wins a nuclear war
No deal.
clickbait
Putin doesn't like Ukraine exercising 'self determination' even though before his invasion Ukraine was in no way joining NATO in his lifetime since it didn't meet the requirements to do so.    So Putin decided to annex the country by forcing his soldiers to kill their own ethic peoples.  "No NATO or I'll kill Ukraine myself!  If I can't have it nobody will!  And if anyone tries to stop me from destroying Ukraine I'll nuke your ass, and kick the asses of my own Russian citizens who dare protest me destroying Ukraine!"
Whether or not he stops the conflict.  Hes still guilty of war crimes. He needs to be held accoutable
Stop acting like a fool and tell the demands.
You are not in control pootin!
what kind of "Democracy" we are running to ban access to RT. people wake up, you are slipping into new phase of Marxism specifically design for West. "Always cook the Lobster slowly"
Putin is not in a position to set demands - His Loyal soldiers are not loyal and do not want to be invading another country and are now getting push back.  Yes, Ukraine will have setbacks as well, but Putin is losing this war against Europe and everything in our power should be used to stop Putin and define Putin like Hitler - a Human rights and war criminal. Putin can then work out his exit strategy like Hitler did.
The beast with iron teeth and claws of brass will stamp the residue with its feet.
This guy should be put in a safe room and left there. Can we please take away that big red button too? This is crazy.
They should peel the skin from the bodies of his children for the lives he took in his exercise.
Putin already started shaking and loosing confident of taking over Ukraine by brutal means.
The President of France, the Prime Minister of Israel, the President of Turkey... How many heads of government will go and ask Putin in person to stop the war? I wonder if Biden would do the same? 🤔... Nah!
LMAO !!! Doesn't anyone see it??  This is , in your face EXTORTION DEMANDS,  plain and simple. You can only pull this off when you know the most powerful nation in the world,  has a compromised president leading the country, that sits as far away from the red button that ,it would take going through kameltoe Harris,  Nancy Pelosi, and a flight of stairs,to push . I wish I was joking.
Believe you dont want the kind of Ucranians went to refuges in Europe, mostly good but soon you Will see why are called so racist. I hope nobody from Azov group get in there.
Long Live Russia 🌹Jai Hind 🇮🇳Jai Bharat 🌹
Horrible, no facts, reporting.
He want an end because he is loosing. Lack of ammunition and lack of conviction in soldiers...
What "demands"? One is for Ukraine to stop fighting? That's like beating someone up and then demand they stop fighting back as a condition to stop beating them up. If you want Ukraine to stop fighting, then maybe stop blowing up their country and GTFO. No, the only question to be answered is for Russia to GTFO and how quickly can they pack up their shit and leave? And, how soon are they gonna write the check to pay for rebuilding Ukraine after they destroyed it? It's a comical fail (if it weren't an epic tragedy for Ukraine) that if the objective was to keep NATO out, he will now have far more countries on the border with Russia joining NATO than if he hadn't embarked non the dumbfckery adventure of invasion.
If I was in charge of America, I would put troops in UKRAINE and dare Putin to use Nuclear Weapons.  Let's see if the madman Putin is as ready to die as he is ready to kill.
LOL this guy Putin just keeps pissing in everybody’s pocket. No truth comes out of it’s mouth
Never
America does the same thing as putin except America sugar coats it.
How arrogant these are invade other country and set up conditions
Erdogon is deep state agent and is a jew
.At the end of the Soviet Union the then leader Gorbachev made a deal with the USA, EU and NATO agreeing that NATO would never expand towards the East - to Russia...! WHO VIOLATED THAT AGREEMENT ? So.. what is the history of this dispute? We must go back to the fall of the Soviet Union after which the Ukraine became an independent Country. The people of the Ukraine organized democratic held elections in which Viktor Yanukovych became President. The voters voting for Yanukovych wished for their Country to stay neutral and to do trade with both the EU and Russia. But the WEF Globalist controlled EU told Yanukovych to only trade with them and he also had to make the Ukraine a member of NATO, or their would be no deal at all. Yanukovych refused. The EU then did everything to remove Yanukovych from power - in which they succeeded - to replace him by a corrupt Ukraine traitor by the name of Poroshenko. As soon as Poroshenko was installed is when he asked the EU and NATO for "protection" against Russia, and so the EU promised to protect Poroshenko. Now feeling secure Poroshenko started to discriminate the Russians living in the east of Ukraine because they didn't want to become part of the EU or NATO. So the Russian citizens living in Ukraine got randomly bombarded by the Ukrainian Government for 8 years straight to which they finally called Putin for help. See how this works? Putin doesn't want Ukraine to become a NATO member. What would the USA do if Putin was to place troops and rockets along the south or northern US border.. would the USA say : "O please, go ahead " ? The truth is: WEF / EU Globalists want Putin be removed and replaced by some Russia corrupt traitor doing the wishes of the WEF Globalists. Make no mistake (and we see it clearly now in Canada) - the WEF Globalists want to rule the whole world; Communist style with Chinese style "social credit score".
It probably is a trap .you can  not  trust  him
Russian military equipment is junk and even the mighty S300 and S400 are being destroyed by drones . The trucks have China tires that are blowing out and now getting stuck in the mud as the weather warms up .  Russia is sending non armored citizen trucks by rail to feed and refuel the front which are easy pickings for small arm fire . All he has is large non smart bombs .  He's not in any position to demand anything and should start worrying about China taking advantage or his people overthrowing him . India might want to have a hard look at the junk they've bought because China is seeing how easy it is to destroy Russian trash with shoulder fired  rockets and drones which they have a lot of . Russian nuclear forces are likely just as unreliable and in disrepair . Tug boats and tow trucks will be in high demand in Russia if he keeps fighting . India won't be getting any help from the west next time they need it after refusing to vote against all of this killing and supporting the dictator . The free world is taking notice of who's their friend and who's not and as of late India seems to be dithering in favor of a mad man dictator . Once Russia goes broke India will not be able to get parts or backup while Russia tries to restock and feed their masses.
President Putin is only standing up for his people Ukrainians included. I don't consider Ukraine European so the title is misleading
Those conditions are total bullshit and shouldn't be adhere to. Let Putin go and F**k himself. Slava 🇺🇦 💪 ❤
From very first day demands are same.
The Non Existent NATO UN Europe Community that's what happens to the world
Committing  “WAR CRIMES”, then setting “CONDITIONS” to end this 🧐 Proves only one thing, Putin is VERY SICK, plus it exposes his “BLUFF” over an nuclear end game 🤔
Hitler 2 demanding  again!! Send a Rocket 🚀  to  his desk!!! Before he murders more mothers and children
Thats a whole lot of nothing report
So basically for Ukraine to surrender. Great
You people are absolutely insane if you don’t take those reasonable demands and relieve everyone of thinking about nuclear war every second
Putin fears exactly what? Which NATO nation wants to level him and make Russia a vacation resort?
STOP CALING HIM PRESIDENT !!!!
Peace must bargained without any personal ego.
Moscow's demands started the war in the first place. So he is saying there will be no ceasefire. We can hear you loud and clear Vladimir.
demands from russian people or putin
What demands?
*Mr Putin these are not sanctions. Its special financial operation. We are here to save your economy*
dont trust him keep fighting for your freedom,we must end Putin's reign.
Do not trust ANYTHING that Putin SCUMM is saying or promising. They broken agreements before and they will do it again. There is no point beleifing this scumm LIAR
Former Yugoslavia breaks apart resulting in civil war nato and the UN join in the conflict bombing city’s. They create a safe zone in Srebrenica send troops to protect the city but when it comes under attack they abandon their own troops and allow a genocide to take place. 2013 the elected government in Ukraine is overthrown due to civil unrest, the newly elected government again faces civil unrest. This unrest leads to 2 provinces wanting to break away resulting in civil war. After 8 (again 8) years Putin steps in to force an end to the conflict. It took the west 1 year to intervene in former Yugoslavia, where were the UN peacekeepers after MH17 was shot down?
Summing up, if you surrender and give us your country without fight, we are going to stop the war.
poor ukrain..this is unnesasary war.cruel war.president puttine is a terrarist.
You can’t believe a word pooptin says
I just read on a different news feed that Putin says Ukraine is owned by Russia because Ukraine's speak Russian so what dude most of Arizona speaks Spanish and it doesn't mean Mexico owns Arizona, here's an idea how about share Ukraine make it an alliance between the 2 super powers USA and Russia can learn how to get along through Ukraine, but it won't happen and why because USA is out for money and greed and Russia is out for control and war so u both lose.
Can someone tell me what's Putin demands? the reporter forgot that part
Russia wants to end the war if Ukraine submits to Putin. this is a joke Ukraine has a democratically elected president and a dictator demands voluntary submission to oppression? The raid was not carried out by Ukraine.
Gee thanks, so the conditions are to accept the demands, very informative ...
Half info
So what are Russia's demands?
I'd rather not hear this from whiney Indians
what are the demands?
This war MUST end immediately.
Submission or admission is subjective in sex only but objectives by hypothesis as doctrines in religions and politics leadership for sympathy, equality, humanity, honesty with politeness without force or remorse as honor system has eluded reliable stoic humans except return of imaginary Jesus or Muhammad? So, keep hope alive only! Hahaha!
Absolutely not!
so what happens after the operations stops? no punishment to putin? he already destroyed hundreds of innocent lives. this man's ego is so entitled.
I thought this was a news channel? What are the demands?
Who the hell is erogodogan
Stop yelling and tell what are the demands
How can he hold out, his troops are starving, his military is failing and Biden is worried Putin will invade Russia!!! If it wasn't for all the death, this would be a great Monte Python skit!!!
Ukrainians must  welcome Russian soldiers by giving them water cakes where they will turn against PUTIN.
So... Putins like when we win it stops.   It's amazing that one man has the Earth as hostages under threat of annihilation of the human race....
Jai Hinduja.  All globalist elites had   despised  Putin as the International Pariah terror dalit but now he looms large  as  the International mafia boss who can have his cake and eats it.
And here I thought he said he was on a peace mission to "liberate" and "denazify" Ukrain.
Here’s an idea: Let the Ukrainian people decide on their future.
So much he care for his people haha
White gangster
Beware Moscow he is King 👑.
Let me guess, Putin's demands are unreasonable? Lol
What demands?
First of all Criminal Putin is the problem. No one person with respect to Law and order and regard to life would dare play this power play and taunt the biggest world Nuclear Power that would lead to wiping out humanity as we know it. His reckless criminal actions, Puts this gangster in no position to smile and dictate the course of an independent Sovereign Nation! The opposite should happen. That is a more powerful united Nato forces throughout Europe protecting the people's rights and liberties. The only negotiating I would do is to lock him up in prison for war crimes period.
Vladolf Putler is cornered.
In other words ....Putin wants the Ukraine to surrender....the Russians are getting their ass kicked. He knows it.
Just negotiate,don't let them push you to get angry. We are praying for you you constantly. For God,do the right things. I always admire you and your works. Psalm 60 is a psalm of ✌️✌️✌️✌️✌️🙌🙌🙌✌️✌️🙌✌️🙌✌️🙌✌️🙌✌️🙌🙌✌️🙌✌️🙌✌️🙌✌️🙌🙌 victory. Remember you never alone. We the Africans are praying for you. Negotiate.
Zelenskyy is totally gone mad ...to play with lives of his country men. I don't get what is the need for Ukraine put a fight with its neighbor n sign a nato n eu agreement with ppl far away from the country. Did nato came to save Zelenskyy!? Or its ppl? No then why the hell that Zelenskyy is trying to be part of eu n nato. Dumb Zelenskyy
In my eyes the Ukrainians won this fight hands down 💯 strong minded
You can’t fight the resistance- Bradley Noel
Turkey is a non entity. It’s mediation is irrelevant
Putin's demands are unacceptable; Ukraine is a sovereign nation that has a right to defend itself and pursue any direction it pleases.  Russia must return Crimea, withdraw all of its forces and pay an indemnity to rebuild everything it destroyed in a foreign nation or it will collapse not only economically.
Stop invading?
if ukraine stops fightingbthere will be no more ukraine
Turkey needs to sink every Russian vessel traveling through their waters.
Erdogan is duplicitous in his dealings,  because he has an alliance with Putin, Syria and Iran where they all agree that Israel is the main problem in the middle east...and it must be eliminated. Under Putin's guidance and direction,  Iran has been allowed to set up military bases in Syria close to the border of Israel...and a Russian official has warned Israel not to fly incursive strikes in Syria against these bases...and that the Golan heights does not belong to Israel, it is Syrian territory. I think you will see an expanded war, that will end up in Israeli territory...in fact, this war , described as having Russia as the chief instigator is described in the Bible in Ezekiel 38 and is the set up for the beginning of the apocalypse described in the book of Revelation. In Ezekiel 38 the country that coordinates the attack on Israel is called "Rosh" which is the Hebrew word for the territory now occupied by the nation of Russia.  Check it out...or watch Neflix...cause it's only the end of the world.
Dear citizens, concentrate on the light, good and love within and around us from now on. Focus on creating good in its most valuable forms. People started joining forces and helping each other. That is what gives the true power to people, nations and to the World.
This is a country worthy of praise... Fearless and firm in their decision......they are not hypocrites or cowards... Turkey has  the largest  influx of Syrian refugees.. Who enjoy a healthy life style in Turkey... Salute to Turkey 🌹
"Is the fastest growing refugee crisis in Europe since WW II" No wonder nobody believe media.
We will not be blackmailed by this tyrant.
Lmao!!!! Stop resisting and do everything we say, then we will stop bombing.
If you don’t know his demands and wants by now then you’re lost and you should start at Day 1 videos.
To stop killing innocent people and children world leaders will set conditions!!!! We have made this planet Hell.
So what are the demands??!!!!
Vlad my Put in : *These are My Demands, please take them seriously*  *Condition 1)* Stop adding Pineapple to Pizza's  *Condition 2)* there is no such thing as Vegetarian Biryanis, but only Veg Pulav   *Condition 3)* People cooking NonSense food like Russian Cutlet which is not actually Russian will be Nuked by me Personally   *Condition 4)* All Tic Tok Artists should undergo Weekly Mental checkup  *Condition 5)* there should be Piped Water, Natural Gas and Russian Vodka for every Home, office and schools
Par Moscow conditions hai kya behen?😁
This wasn't one of her better updates she needed  less repeating and more context to what the demands were. Part of the demand is for Nato to reduce  their military capabilities. This is non negotiable  Russia has just shown its run by a mad man  that can't be trusted. I have a gun 🔫  in my house. It threatens  no one unless you break in uninvited. It's called defense My Putin and it's needed.
...bottom line : don't trust Putin, is pure evil hiding behind a mask, just ask any real Russians hence the mass migration to Finland and Sweden.
So Putin is scared if Ukraine joining NATO?
The demands are?
Modi ji should also consider to visit Moscow.  Definitely he is a big leader to influence the Russians.
Putin should only burn in hell even though hes even too evil for hell, he is beyond disgusting. The world needs to come together and teach this whole a lesson
Poetin is obsessed
To god be the GLORY.  We don't want war in the world.  We want peace. 🍢🍢🍢
Basically if the negotiators had accepted the same reasonable demands for security and the agreement to obey existing old treaties and commitments weeks ago!  🐻👩‍🔧🇺🇲⚒️🇷🇺
FAQ BALD RADISH
The rest of the world shouldn't let the war end on putins conditions, after all he started the war so we( especially the west) should end the war but with a SEVERE death toll on the ruddian side, they need to be wiped out. The full country need to be wiped out and demilitarized and de-nuked
So: unconditional surrender is Putin's "conditions". He doesn't know what negotiating is. He's just the neighbourhood bully.
The condition Russia set for ending the invasion. Oh sorry, "Military Operation" is for Ukraine to "stop fighting"?  .... So.... Its pretty much a demand to surrender.  If Ukraine falls, It's going to be the same tactic for other countries to capture and invade others.
Wow! the dictator continues to have verbal diarrhea demanding "...Russian will halt OPs if Ukraine stopped fighting and only if Moscow's demands are meant..."  Anything else Heir Putin?  PLEASE DON'T HOLD BACK ON YOUR DEMANDS.
Lol Putin messed up ...he doesn't know it yet but he just signed his own regime change contract with the U.S ... By putO
ok that was a waste of 2 mins. I didnt hear what the conditions actually where other than 'until ukraine stops firing and russias conditions are met'
Rules of negotiation: Don't ask for the impossible. Don't lie. Don't be rude.  Putin lied and is asking for the impossible. Why should Ukraine leave Crimea for Russia?
CYPRUS A MEMBER OF EU IS UCUPATED SINCE 1974 FROM TURKEY.....BUT NONE SAYS ANYTHING...THIS IS HYPOCRISY!!!!!!
This is stupid, we need Palki to report the good info..
Russia has no right to set any conditions. They need to go home and lick their wounds and leave everyone else alone! There will be no forgiveness and no turning back the world's disgust of Putin and his inhumane treatment of the Ukrainian people.
Stop fighting said the bully
The demands are: give me ukraine, so i can proceed to invade the rest of eastern europe & bring back the soviet union
Putin: Yes, we can end this. Just tell the Ukranian people to let us conquer them first.  Sounds reasonable.
How about the Balkans? That was in Europe and way bigger than this
I see you rads
He is loosing.and he knows it.
Excellent show of support for Putin by biased Indian ally news channel . Multi Bn trade deal makes India abstain at UN vote . Its all about the money .
Russians are right since Ukraine is used by WesternBastards esp USA BritishBastards & NATO Expansionism is real threat since 2008. Ukrainians are scapegoat for WesternBastards
lol bye bye putler
Thank Turkiye' ... for standing up and taking new leadership role in greater region to bring about a better, more humbled, sustainable stability and security environment for all  ✌🌐 miru , spacibo
A big man with big house attacked his neighbor with a tiny house because he felt threatened by this tiny neighbor being friendly to another big guy who lives across the street who he doesn’t particularly like. So he crushed into this tiny house uninvited, beat his neighbor senselessly with giant malice, demanded the surrender of the tiny house backyard, money and all cutlery knives and never to befriend anyone but him. Then declare to everyone that his neighbor is a menace so this is simply a friendly neighbor cleanup operation for the greater good of the entire neighborhood , it wasn’t bullying nor robbery, so don’t interfere or else.  Politics, so complicated…
Lol what are the demands?
Umm.....I'm pretty sure these have been his demands since he started this murder spree.
Wil Moscow rebuild Ukraine again wil Moscow bring back al the people they killed.. they speak so easily and yet they can't give the people answers
Enough the stop the war
You  can not  trust  Putin
This is a sign of weakness from Putin. He's starting to reach out to allies, meaning the fight and progress not going well.
Zelinski won't, he is emboldened by the western media and EU. He is foolishly leading his country down a path of destruction.
You can't tied my hands at my back, hit my stomach and warn me not to scream. Hell no,it can't be possible.
Lol.   What a joke.  Little P  your going Down .
He's just buying time sanction him again
let them go bankrupt. no conditions and they get out completely out of Ukraine including kremia. unless he gets booted out from the Russian government. we all know that if he has an upper hand he will not negotiate he just shot to kill. VLADIMIR PUTIN THE DICTATOR BORN IN THE RONG ERA DANGEROUS FOR RUSSIA DANGEROUS FOR THE WORLD.
I can already guess what those terms will look like
What are Moscow's demands??? Surrender???  Simply nuts!!!
Yea but what are these fucking demands???
Two disgusting dictators shaking hands.
The aggressor/invader should never set the terms for ending their transgressions ... that's like punching someone in the face, and expecting them to apologise for getting their blood on your hand!
Ukraine don't quit tell Putin's dead
Putin is in no position to set conditions upon anyone else except his cult followers and the gang of terrorists that he leads. He chose war over diplomacy.  That leaves him alone with his "friends" to boil in their own anger and hate.
Funny how they ban a lot of news channels yet this muppet channel is still running
Oh what a change in demands. I guess he thinks if he keeps saying they are new, he will actually believe it.
Russia: "Ukraine should surrender to enable us to enter Ukraine.  The fight will stop."
Haha no
Don't believe Putin. He is sneaky.
The world needs to remove Putin from office and elect an adult who will lead Russia with integrity and sanity so the we can get back to addressing issues that make the world a better place for all of us.... like fighting climate change and ending hunger.
Let me guess. Russia's conditions for ending the invasion is for Ukraine to surrender unconditionally.  This is all a joke. Putin has proven that he can't be trusted for a second and that he'll promise you something an hour before he turns around and does the exact opposite while laughing at you.
Yes, that's what I thought ukraine stop fighting, and give into russia demands. Give us all you have, what kind of deal is that. putin is an idiot, a very stupid idiot. They are not going to walk away from their lives. Come on Putin get real.
i belive..in Alquran said...russia will win...100 % true...this is The Great WAR..Nato will defete,,,and all muslim country will support Russian...no joke
He doesn't set his conditions.  He dictates his crazy sick orders as he did before he starts this immoral and nonsense war or massacre
Russia owes reparations and punitive damages, but that would require an actual currency and integrity.
Tell that dictator hell no
Putin already lied  so why trust his words when they are empty...
Stop war there are to much inncocent People si antichissimi si Jesus, no Elohim no nordici
What only if Ukraine stop fighting?
I think the UN and Nato need to get those EMP's ready and take out the Kremlin and Putin so they can put an end to this once and for all by a strike team going into the kremlin and killing all those putin bastards, the ones that do not surrender then die and putin would be put down immediately upon site as no war time court dates etc we need putin gone off the planet now as he is a snake and if he can blow up his own people he can get out of war crimes he just needs to be gone now !!!
Why not tell what the conditions are ?, this was such a weird piece of news, perhaps an announcement.. ?
Thank you WION
❤️🇷🇺❤️
Como le vas a devolver la vida a los niños muertos?
Never surrender your weapons in a conflict.  History has shown that 1 before , it didn’t end well .  When you feel you are losing , fight harder .  Ukraine agreed to allow level 4 bio labs from pentagon on Russia boarder .   This and zelensky yelling he was going to make nukes , put Putin completely out of his mind .
how can this be a bigger refugee crises than bosnia
Fkin repeating the same thing 10 times without saying the actual news... horrible. Save yourselves 2 minutes of your lives and skip this video, she wont say what you want
"It's no longer possible for the US to expect the whole World to dance to their tune"
What a waste of a video without telling the conditions, almost like clickbait
Lol russia will be bankrupt if they don't leave. Let them get Zeroed.
What's newsworthy? You are repeating the same scentence over and over...
Blessed are the peacemakers : for they shall be called  the children of God.
Putin’s demand is to let Ukraine kneel before him kissing his boot. The world should help Ukraine to defeat Russian’s invasion.
What are the conditions? Lots of words but specifics . . . ambiguity.
It is special political demands.
War criminal Putin has nothing to demand...just take his military back home and shut up
Turkey wants a ceasefire so that it’s NATO partners can send more weapons to Ukraine. I don’t think Putin is that stupid.
Moscows demands are not big
Beating around the bush like a mf.
Essentially, Putin want Ukraine to surrender.
Putin is a liar and cannot be trusted. He said he was not going to invade Ukraine, that the West was lying, that it was just an exercise with the other liar in Belarus - yet he did invade Ukraine. He said he was only targeting military areas, yet once he realise that Ukraine was a much tougher cookie than he thought, he began to target homes and offices indiscriminately. His words cannot be trusted - he is a lying criminal. GLORY TO UKRAINE!
This news is not true
Dismantle NATO.
At 0:41 Putin went for fist bump but denied to a hand shake
@wion where are the conditions?
Russian Federation victory imminent.
This video clip is a waste of the public's time spent viewing it. So sad that the media can't do a better job.
Indian media warned Putin for busy schedule for state election results...so end of war
what kind of news is this wtf
Grande Putin patrioti italiani con i fratelli russi👍🇷🇺🇮🇹 combattiamo la mafia UE NATO USA mafia mondiale
TROOPS To UKRAINE !!!!!! AND FIGHTERS !!!!!
Teaser video, no explanation of the demands
Mr Putin sir 👍
WION, come on,…… hmmmm?
The invasion failed now he's open to talks.
Really expected the video to tell us some demands.
Never! Don’t believe it! Putin wants to turn Ukraine to dust with everyone in it, and after he will continue with the whole of Europe!! He’s a terrorist! Remember? He doesn’t want to stop the war!! He started it in 2014 and hast stop!! The man has been saying this since day dot! And Ukraine? Send more weapons!! NATO come help! Pathetic! All Putin wants is Ukraine not to join NATO and considering how they operate! With very good reason! It’s a security threat to Russia! Why’s so hard to understand?
A condition is for Ukraine to stop fighting.  Good luck with that! 💪
If this situation wasn't so serious, it would be comical. Ukraine should put in its own conditions if Russia will leave Ukraine then hostilities will cease... 😝 If this new cast is true... amazing how this could be said with a straight face. This needs to be a skit on SNL (Saturday Night Live). 😜
Brilliant often the most despised men in history are the most INTEGRAL to its sucess, for both Erdogan and Putin are Integrity men, powerful, stable, influences on shaping Europe and the Middle East. The World needs them both for they have a lot to contribute the future of Russia and the Ukraine, do not forget Russia destroyed 13 US Defence Biological labs that is evidence on a massive scale of serious provocations by the US Puppet Government of Selensky, the Darling of the social left and Neo con Nazi militias. Who imprisoned 200 Opposition members during 2014/2016. Selensky is no Prima Donna. World Peace is better then World War, God Bless Russia and the Ukraine.
Yeah right, russia has set conditions already and ukraine hasnt accepted, zelensky wants to show strenght which will only result in the destruction of his country and countless deaths, lets see if he'll save lives and leave the idea of joining nato or kill thousands more brcause on stupidity
Moscow's demands are met means (1) the installation of a Vichy France government in Kyiv that is subordinate in every respect to Moscow; (2) no NATO or European membership for Ukraine and the rolling back of NATO membership to all countries that joined in the last thirty years. These demands are absurd and impossible to meet. Thank you very much and have a great day Fred Simcha Sarah Norman Family 🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗
พ่อปูหยุดรบให้โอกาสกันบ้างนะ อย่าลืมรักดูแลตัวเองกันนะครับ.
Do not let Putin out of there. Draw him in and then destroy his pathetic war machine.
Tell us the conditions.
I’ll meet your demands right here! ABCDE FU!
Once having respect for the President, Now ???   all change.  Even One Nuclear Bomb means the whole world will suffer,  for ?  an  unknown time.  Either, the West Stop their advance and Really Mean it. then President Putin may feel at ease.  Lets face it ,one can understand some concerns ,as each time he pulls back ,the first thing is, missile sites aimed at Russia  on his border?  would you not be upset.  Not taking sides , yet what is happening to Ukraine is totally wrong. They are free and do not want Dictatorship.    The Russian People even do not want what is happening ,plus many soldiers, it is the people and their Army that may only stop this.  Surely the President must know that Most of the world will be against him, and His Own people will feel this through sanctions and alike. If he is Ill, then he probably is not worried about any consequences. Yet there will always sadly be someone who wants more , Why ,no-one lives forever ,Greed , Bigger toys to show off, what For ?  to go down in History ?  looks like no future to tell of,  at this rate.
great news work, now what are the demands?...
Then what for of the dead people, soldiers, innocent children, all the people involve of the war or killings because of this irrational conflict. All were collateral damages of war that life cannot undo or bring back..condition no more but all the people involve whether russians, ukrainians, western and europeans must stop and put an end to this unending, unlovable place and earth to lived-in for all human-man kind.let progress, peace and unity bring us all together.
What the hue & cry regarding this war. Zelensky just have to commit that they won't join NATO, war ends. But he won't cause he is US puppet & US wants to prolong this war as to weaken Russia economically & militarily. Zelensky is an exceptional actor & with US propoganda machine he has been able to convince that he is a patriot & had Ukranians suffer.
Russia attacks Ukraine. Ukraine : Putin stop killing the people of my country.  Russia : I will only stop invading your country if you stop fighting. And also if you meet my demands. Rest of the World (excluding N. Korea & China) : Is this man OK!
I am so confused that so many posters below are not able to see the way out here? Past conflicts are there to teach us what to do and what not to do! Ego has no place where lives  can be saved by means of concession? Russia needs the commitment from NATO that it will stop extending eastward; This includes Ukraine! Ukraine whilst to be applauded for bravery should think about the many lives that will be saved by a basic level of concession. Putin does NOT NEED sovereignty of Ukraine! He wants assurances that NATO will back off and not threaten their country at their doorstep. There is a resolution on the table. But if we act like punch drunk angry people we will not change this chance for peace! This conflict has NO comparison to WW11. Russia does NOT want to expand its boundaries. It wants security and concessions from the West!
The Putin Paradox:  Putin demands the set-back of certain conditions he thinks are dangerous for Rusia.  He goes to war.  War itself may proove to be the end of Rusia... or at least it's regime.
I guess Putin is willing to destroy its own country.. for what ? He’s old what ever dream he has . He never see it ..  Putin .. war criminal  It’s what he will be remembered.. his legacy … Glory to Ukraine 🇺🇦
What conditions? Terrible news channel
Yeah, because the whole world knows that if Putin were serious, he would tell Turkey about it, first!!
Putin's words can no longer be trusted and he is a War criminal now.. Maybe we stop the sanctions once he's turned in and tried in an international court ?
Pray for russia🇷🇺🔱🔱🔱🔱🔱
I just clicked on this video so I could read the comments.. Comment section has more info than the actual video. 🤣🤣🤣
Putin , things didn't go like the way you have been hoping for now you have some special demands to stop the unprovoked war ?  You shouldn't have started it . Ukraine is an independent country and it has the rights to decide which way it wants to go , it has nothing to do with you .
In other words for Ukraine  surrendering to all of Russian demands first hahaha. Just like saying I'll stop robbing you when you give me all your money! 🤣
Appease the mad man ??? To hell with Putin
why hasn't anyone gone to Russia and attacked yet?
They can always return to Ukraine when conflict ends.
Putin is a psicopath and nobody can negotiate with psychopaths..... so..... what is all this for??
I said about a week and a half ago, Putin would go in, punch stuff up, and be out in a week. I guess it might be 2 weeks? I'd be surprised if this doesn't end quick.
Terrorists supporter Turkey is trying mediate.. what a joke 🤣
There was zero information in this video, about anything.
Russia shouldn't stop without teaching WEST a befitting reply for their cruel gameplan
Conditions are to stop fighting… ok so they stop and putin just walks up and knocks on kyevs door… don’t think that’s going to be freely given lol
Lmao he wants all of Europe 😂 boi gtf
I think the crux of the issue is to do with safety: no one feels 100% safe. If you look at the problem from the perspective of all sides, the common denominator is a fear of the 'other' and what they might do. Russia feels like it cannot fully trust NATO, and vice versa. I don't know what the best way forwards is, but perhaps Ukraine should have just remained neutral and communicated that to all sides. Maybe I'm wrong though.
NATO, UN, and EU support for Ukraine is only diplomatic and economic.  Ukraine's surrender is imminent; so that sooner is better than later in order to save lives.
One of the demands by Putin is that Ukraine's stop fighting?  In other words if Ukraine stops defending itself against the invaders. Aye right lol, keep fighting Ukraine, kick the huns back over the border in humiliating fashion.
He can call what he wants,  but we all know it's an unprovoked war on a peaceful country and people.  God bless Ukraine and all its people.
Putin has no right to set conditions. He is clearly in the wrong here.
Delete this useless video giving abstract news
Zelensky got played by usa, he should surrender, but he doesnt care about his folks
Let’s say a Prayer for all of the uneducated people in these comments and hope they find some common sense.
Putin is worried about money
Hope it will end
Putin may be right that it is not a war. It is starting to look like a Turkey Shoot in my opinion.
stop NATO expansion as promised by US foreign affairs minister Baker in 1991 & stick to 1991 certified neutrality of Ukraine signed by the USA. Should not be a big deal considering that Putin has let Nato expand already.  Why be greedy??
The US needs to stop buying any oil from Russia. Biden needs to restore our energy independence.
These dictator bots on here talking about zelenski's old profession of being a comedian..  Just because someone has a sense of humor doesn't make them weak.. if anything It can make them even more predictable and that's what's happening now.. Putin thought Zelinsky was a joke and now he's paying for it. The laugh is on Mr. Dictator. 😂🤣😂🤣
Please, never mention what Moscow's demands actually are 😂😂😂
Hes dictating the whole world not just his country
What a crap report !! And we've learnt what exactly ???
Putin/Hitler will lose this war of choice. The conditions of the rest of the world are;  End of Putin/Hitler's power, a return to the pre-war borders of Ukraine (pre-2012) and financial reimbursement from Russia for all the war damage, likely in the trillions of US dollars. Putin/Hitler has destroyed Russia's standing in the world for generations.
thats the news i want to hear WION not like this OTHER STUPID OUTLET NEWS THEY ARE PUSH WW3 of there hatred statement
What are his conditions u guys suck at the news
Putin you are not strong .You cant the structure of god .There is no agreement to sign .You own soldiers will turn against you .
I wonder what Putin would do if all these Refugees   headed to Moscow and joined the Russian protesters ??       Imagine  5 Million angry people at his front door
Putin has really dangerous thoughts, and a disaster is in the making, by denying the Ukraine People and its State a legitimate existing, that is straight out of Nazi Germany's toolbox, search for Bloodland by Timothy Snyder.
...and YOU PUTIN REBUILD UKRAINE
Putin condition is just hoax he started the invasion of Ukraine so he must stop this war.  Never to trust him.
... "and Turkey will act as a peacemaker"...
And those demands are?
At least mention the demands in the report
Putin can go to hell !
Time To Denazify Kremlin!!!
More like they will stop when all their weapons have been destroyed and troops quit.
Russia has been getting away with murder for far too long! It's time the teaches them and their chimp buddies in China a lesson! It wouldn't take a single weapon to do it, all it take is all types of financial sanctions.
We all need to aid these clean white educated Ukrainian refugee people....Hitler Biden Pelosi Schumer Hunter Biden
NEVER! Putin has started this insane war based on lies! Putin can not be trustet! Bless the people of the Ukraine and give Russia Hell!!
What are the demands?
If a news has a face: how to fool the people with repeating the same thing again and again but not saying the actual news
¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡ESE LÁCRA CALVO YA NO ESTÁ EN CONDICIONES PARA PONER CONDICIONES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Someone should remind Putin that he is the one to stop bombing and withdraw his military then Ukraine will have no one to fight.
what are the conditions?
Putin is paranoid president in Russia
Let me guess. He wont ceasefire unless he gets a fuckin pet dragon too? He aint turning back now. Hes going to stab the world in the back either way. Hes got NATO by the balls.
He probably demands Ukraine becomes a part of Russia!
Latest news sounding like old news
Liesssssssssssssss lies ...liar
it feels so good to read comments and realise that I'm not the only one who knows that Ukraine is being used as a puppet by NATO and most of the responsibilities for the current situation lies with NATO
America is the Mafia of this war
....how can you take em seriuisky!!  THEY'RE NOT WEARING MASK !!!
You should mention exactly what are those demands
It's a lie...   surrender or be crushed is the condition. If Ukraine surrenders, the casualties and torture will be magnified.
Down with tyrants and Neo-Holodomorists.  SLAVA MOTHER UKRAINE!! 🇺🇦🇨🇦
and Moscow's demands are..........?.  Totally pointless report.
No to Moscow demands.
He's feeling the heat
Funny how title is different when Turkey’s President  meets Putin than when Israeli Prime minister meets its a headline
Something new, oh how surprising nothing new comes out of this mental men's mouth.
Modi loose chance to play the role Just edorgan played shit
Putin is in Ukraine territory,now,who should stop fighting?  Did Ukrain start the fight? Russia is trespassing,and that's a serious offence. Putin is ending badly. He was a great leader,not anymore.
Was the demands included repeating Putins demands (4) times without explaining the demands?
Thank you ,I know there will be a debate regards the word.' DEMANDS' ,however the priority here is to stop the killing of these children their parents and the destruction of their cities and homes in its tracks their must be however I feel an agreement ALSO  of understanding that their must be an immediate ceasefire upon these Ukrainian peoples and  that Ukrainians have the freedom to choose their own destiny ,surely this must be included.
Hey, it's not Poothin it's Putin
Putin and the world's billionaires can only live in their bunkers for a few years after nuclear fallout. Then they'd need to come out. Good luck. I'd say if nuc missiles are launched dying IMMEDIATELY is going to be a blessing. God help us all.
Europe already has a refugee crisis from the United States continual bombing of the middle-east.
The people of Ukraine are kicking some serious putin butt!  Now, putin is looking for a way out.  He knows that the Ukrainian people are gaining momentum, and will soon destroy his armies.
This’s da third time they’re meeting don’t believe da Russians r just playing games they’re da ones need to stop da ceasefire not da Ukraine’s they invaded Ukraine 🇺🇦 this’s a strategy Putin is using to keep da war going on n wipe down Ukraine out of da map. I’m hoping 🙏🏽n praying 🙏🏽 to God is true God bless Ukraine 🇺🇦 n protect them we love uuuuu Jesus…
Russia can never win this war
🏆🇺🇦
It's coming... and it's a big one 🕜😂. I'll survive this one , but Wion wouldn't !
Ukraine isn’t figh ting they are defending themselves . They don’t have a choice.
Someone broke into my house. They have weapons, trashed my home, killed my family and are now squatting. They will stop killing my extended family only if I put down my bb gun and meet their demands. Why should I negotiate with criminals?
SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE!!! PWEHH!!
Clickbait - This is how credibility is lost
The world doesn't negotiate with terrorists and tyrants anymore.
Nazi Pootin is desperate,its hard to trust an old man who is deranged and want to be an emperor.Glory to Ukraine.
DISLIKE
Kissing Turkey's butt
How does Russia expect Ukraine to stop fighting when Russia is the one invading Ukraine!
Shameless they have the right to demand when they are the one attacking civilians,shameless putin!! pweh!!!
Zelensky is actually cruel or paranoid, for the sake of NATO members, he sacrificed his people killed and suffered and his country was destroyed because of war and even wanted to drag Europe into a terrible nuclear war
So after the war who’s gonna fix all the damage Putin?
They would be stupid to take Putin’s word on anything, they where told if you give up your nukes we will guarantee your independence, he said he was not going to invade !  Putin only wants a deal where he can weaken them so WHEN he attacks next time he doesn’t have the problem he is now facing !
0:39 😅
Stop attacking back off and then they may stop fighting and start talking peace.
Ukraine is not fighting because there's no war in Russia
There’s no reason to believe Russia is trying to compromise, just lie to gain the advantage again
Add russia china to Nato u vl not see any war in future
So. is that stop war in reality?
yes nice demands stop defending your country
Wolf calling the tiger back who is erdogan the tyrant
Not going to happen. Special Forces will take out the Gremlin from the Kremlin 👍🇷🇺 🥷🏼⏱
No the war mongering NATO wants war yall need to do what that man says or we all will be in a fucking war
Demands ? What happened to not negotiating with terrorists?  So everyone should bow down to them is all we are hearing.  Do this or that happens ..... wow .... are they going to help rebuild the Country they just destroyed? How about that demand ?
putin is just a fool
Ukraine isn’t fighting they are defending them selves!
Let us not Forget Russia opposed the Iraq war where as Ukraine with NATO bombed and massacred over a million people Karma is bit*h
What humanitarian crisis is this channel referring to. A ten day invasion and there is a humanitarian crisis. This sounds more like news on automatic and no real on the ground reporting. Who is funding this channel. Its biased as well biased can be. Come on. You can do  better than this to obfuscate the truth.
Why stop? Putin should carry on the war because Russia is clearly winning! I expect Ukraine's capital Kyiv to fall to the Russians very soon.
We do not negotiate with terrorists, Putin. Surrender now and we will quarantee that you and you accomplices have a fair trial for your crimes.-Q
🗣 BRING BACK RUSSIAN AKS
He is a freaking liar. He is the aggressor!!!
If you still trust anything Putin says you are a fool. Putin needs to step down and face war crimes that should be part of the deal
It’s not “Moscow’s Invasion”, it’s “Putin’s Invasion”.
This is a sign Putin's super rich Russian friends are concerned about their money, and they have influence on Putin.
Bruh i was waiting fr her to say what the demands were…
the demands are, that Ukrain surrenders to Russia… Not a two way deal is it?! 🙄
Putin is a cry baby just like Trump is. They don't give a damn about people just their way or the highway. We are best to be done with them both.
Now, what is Moscow's demand?
His requests are never going to be met and he knows that what he's actually asking is for Ukraine to surrender
Ukrainians are fighting for their lives, Russia is the aggressor.
Putin just wants to catch up with the inhuman activities of the warmongers in the West.
If NATO were to meet Russia's demands they would only be weakened when the Lying Putin decides to again take a piece of another free country Putin is just like Hitler said one thing and do what they want to do anyway Putin with his lying can not be trusted he must be defeated unfortunately the Russian people are going to suffer and Putin will blame it on NATO and the western alliance the Russian people need to decide if they want this type of person Ruling them like a dictator because that is what Putin is a dictator who has ruled for 22 years have the Russian people had enough of people like Putin running their lives and now making Russia a Parier country of the free world.
Why repeat yourself so many times?
THIS IS A JOKE. Two cruel, narcissistic,  meglamaniacs meeting to discuss humanitarian issues and peace!?   AND YOU ARE TAKEN IN BY IT.       UNSUBSCRIBE TIME!   It is clearly a hastily staged propoganda event purely because Putin is losing control of HIS personal war, all FREE world support, financial control of his country,  control of his own oppressed people and most importantly to him his desired legacy.  He will be remembered in the same way as Hitler, Stalin, Saddam, Gaddafi, Pol Pot and others.  Just a nasty little creep with shoe lifts, constant botox, an Instagram freak and lousy body language.       This rediculous theatre does not deserve airtime or intelligent discussion.  Show it in cartoon form and let him retreat back to his underground bunker as quickly as possible.    Ps: Putin knows Erdogan is a kindred killer - that's why he's not positioned at the end of a 10 meter table like Putin's own staff and generals: any one of which would want to inject him with poison or put a bullet in his empty head.   DELETE THIS FARCICAL REPORT IMMEDIATELY.  OR ARE YOU PUTIN'S PUPPETS ALSO?
World is afraid to destroy one Putin.
So this is basically a hostage situation
Moscow's demands...  1. Ukrainian Army lays down arms 2. Guarantee by US that Ukraine won't join NATO 3. Removal of US Nukes from NATO countries  capisce!
Putin called it invasion ? Really?
Common, give us good results. No need to add more casualties. We can prevent another world war with these.
Whhat are conditions
Dear Mr Putin..The Lord GOD of heaven and earth is in control...Not you.
Rather have his brains on the desk at this point.
Demands like he's  winning
Russia will pay for this for generations!!!
"I'm invading you but I need you to stop fighting"
WION, have you forgotten what happened in Yugoslavia and under what circumstances?  Grow up please and stop being so naive!
Those conditions are ridiculous. The invasion of Ukraine itself is the proof Moldovia, Finland and Sweden should enter NATO. Without NATO and EU help Ukraine would already be under Russian control.
Dislike for misleading headline.
if i was not an old guy - i'd be heading to Ukraine and help them People Fight for Freedom -- Putin should have a $10 Million Bounty on his Head.  Stay Strong Ukraine.
Herr Putin, stoppen Sie diesen Ukraine Krieg. Sie haben auch Kinder und vielleicht auch Enkelkinder. Bei einem 3. Weltkrieg gibt es keine Gewinner. Nicht die Ukraine , nicht Deutschland , nicht die USA , nicht China und auch nicht Russland— und auch nicht Ihre Kinder und Enkelkinder. Stop this war , jetzt.
I’m from Ukraine. I live in Donbas. Nazi Ukraines have been bombing us since 2014. Now we finally got peace when putin signed independence for our regions.
That means, that all Ukrainians shall get slaves of Putin. He is so crazy, that he does not understand, that nobody wants to get his slave, except the cowards around him.
The only brave wise man in Europe
What are the demands? Your report is incomplete!?
He making demands he knows they won't agree to so he can tell his people "See I tried". He also said that the USA and Ukraine were plotting together to attack Russia. This manic is parinoid.
I'd say that most politicians involved in this mess are to blame at some level.
"If Moscow's demands are met"   What a fucking joke.  He is literally a bank robber, Ukraine is the bank, and its people are the hostages. Now, when he realizes that he is cornered and that the bank has no backdoor to sneak out of, he begins making demands that he says must be met in order  for him to stop shooting hostages.  Send in HRT and take this child-murdering shithead out.
It will not happen
WTF he will come and kill people and say stop defending I will stop killing people wtf ashle he
Putin is fighting the US & the west militarily & Jinping  economically. If this both win there would be a new world order & US hegemony would cease to exist.
Love Palestina love Russia🇷🇺
A good news
Tht condition put fort by moscow is not going to bring peace but ignite
Don’t take life so seriously , we are just part of experiment , try to enjoy every moment ✌️
2023; Ukraine will only accept unconditional surrender of Russian forces
Condition ka dyan!! Sira ulo lang  ang peg ni Putin
Western nations:  *The crumbling of the Russian economy is a tragic accident*
Stop without  any condition if Putin is a Man
First demand if Ukraine stop fighting.WHY Ukraine  fighting again?I am asking.
You didn't finish the story.  WHAT are airhead Putin's demands??  (so we can LAUGH at this evil man)...
What were the demands I missed them ?
What are the conditions?
I love Turkey 🦃 more than Mutton
Why are they shaking this mama hand?
"The Russians have made it very clear what they want is a neutral Ukraine. The Russians are not seizing territory they're destroying Ukrainian forces, that's their focus. Zelensky is a puppet and he's putting huge numbers of his own population at unnecessary risk. And quite frankly most of what comes out of Ukraine is debunked as lies within 24 to 48 hours. The notions of taking and retaking airfields. All of this is nonsense it hasn't happened" ~ Col. Douglas Macgregor
Time to stop Putin for good
Stalin, Hitler, Putin.       evil men in our times  who harmed the wolrd.
Thisman actuslly try to retake Alaska next.
Continue the Sanctions
In short, Putin will only stop once Ukrainians stops defending themselves.
Putin is untouchable even US is afraid to engaged with him. UN cannot even pacify the increased attack of soviet army leaving ukrain crying for his people. This is the problem when superpower will initiate a war. Where are the UN peacekeeping force? Will they just wait when everything in ukrain wre destroyed and people were killed?
Even the East are urging you Putin. Stop bloodshed now, peace for Ukraine and all 🙏
What are the Russian demands? Details…..
Only reason I watched was to see what the conditions are. Otherwise the story moot.
Putin's a con artist!
Both of the women announcers here have extremely annoying voices. You would think they are one and the same if it were audio only. Anytime I watch this program I have to turn the sound really low
So what are the demands? no word of it again, looks like we are not supposed to know…
So essentially this war won’t end any time soon.
Sadly, no one trusts a word Putin says. Why do these conversations keep happening when they are utterly worthless? He's laughing at the whole world.
"Nuts"
Win Russia
How to become the owner of a Russian fighter-bomber?    Buy a field in Ukraine!
Putin thinks he has absolute control over Urain and the  people . Thank God the Ukranians listing to the comands of their president,  Putin end game is very soon, his own generals will turn on him.He cant keep killing people any time any where that he like
Putin and XI sitting in a tree, K.I.S.S.I.N.G.  First come trade Then come deception  Then come XI & Putin pushing the well fare carriage.
Damn... Putin was going for a bro fist 💔 Come one Erdogan 😑😑😑😑 You broke the brocode 💔
Well putin has pretty much destroyed everything. So it will end the bombing, also putin can't afford to use all his missiles because russia will be broke soon.
What condition and what demand??? Tell us please!!!
Russian Armed forces are taking a hammering! SO IS THEIR MILITARY EQUIPMENT AND ULTIMATELY THEIR COMMERCIAL SALES TO OTHER COUNTRIES.
The heck.... send some B-21 "raiders" to this Reserve-Stalin.....or activate the Aegis-attack-systeme in Romania or Poland....this Putin will drive us to WW3 yet
Now putin said about condition... if you dont want it, its clear that putin are not the one play this games... if you realy end this war, u must accept what condition it is...
Where is the 6 meter table?
If Russia is so distressed about Ukraine becoming a NATO member right on Russia's border, then why do they not complain as much about Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia?
Repeat the title 6 times in a 2 minutes video. Peak journalism...
😂 he’s feeling the economic pressure! 😂
She said the same thing over and over and over in less then 2 minutes...
it would be stupid for India to turn its back on Russia; the world knows US influences is going down, and the future belongs to Russia and China
The condition for ending the war is Putin's death, the death of his daughters, grandchildren, and other blood relatives.
Hope  culprit America should saw some honesty
This video says nothing. Putin needs to withdraw from Ukraine immediately. He and his army is going to suffer and many of his soldiers are going to desert or surrender or refuse to fight and disable their vehicles. Putin needs Russian citizens to protest en mass and urge his own politicians to kick him out. His own generals (no balls) need to rise up and refuse to fight.
He has no right to set conditions when he is the agressor I'm beginning to think Putin has lost his sanity
God please help to put some sense to both the leaders..to stop war and move towards peace...it is just suffering to both the parties ..civilians in Ukraine are suffering...God please help  .
And What Are the conditions?
A peaceful resolution. After he obliterated Ukraine and innocent people died.  Absolutely not.  Putin started this war and now he wants to set conditions to stop.  How about you just stop and go back to your country.  The nerve of him to even suggest conditions is foolish. He knows he messed up and it’s just a matter of time before he loses power & he might end up being tried for war crimes or even dead.  I love when people are so delusional that they end up screening themselves in the process.  I VOTE TO CAPTURE AND TORCHER HIM.
I like how all the mainstream news were favor about the negative of Russia's and as usual it all favors the US will like playing the hero card at its finest-- America has always been.
It’s not a condition. It’s manipulation
What are Putin's conditions? This video is useless-
Would be nice if you actually said what the demands were in the news report.
Bull.   T
🔥🔥🔥
Russia a country who has nuclear power, only demands Ukraine to demilitarize and abide the NATO conditions, that any country that has border disputes is not eligible to become a member of NATO, that's why Angela Merkel did not endorse Georgia and Ukraine. it's not even a demand, it's only asking to do the right thing.
The sheer arrogance of this man, wow!
This is gonna result into a Thermo Nuclear War between the 13th and the 17th.
The question everyone should be asking right now is why NATO didn't offer to negotiate a neutral status for Ukraine like it did for Finland & Austria. It seems to me that the Russians have a legitimate concern that if Ukraine joined NATO, nuclear missiles will be placed on Russia's western border with capability to hit Moscow in under 5 minutes.
வின் ரஷியா
Well........what are those demands?
Bull Shit!  When hell freezes over Russia!
रूस की शर्ते तुरंत मानकर युद्द को बंद करे यूक्रेन नाटो usa
It took "Turkey" talks involvement ? Hummmm 🤔, the positive way at looking at this ... no deaths for now 👍💯
Leaders tasted the luxurious life dont want anymore to get out of its position. Would kill oppositions & even wanted more power by envading other countries. AIM to dominate the whole world ?   LET US ALL PRAY  TO GOD THAT THIS WON'T HAPPEN.  THAT ONLY GOOD LEADERS WILL SURVIVE. WITH GOD NOTHING IS IMPOSSIBLE!
This guy is now a war criminal, who spends a week destroying Ukrainian homes, schools and hospitals along with hundreds of innocent civilians and then says Ukraine should stop the fighting for there to be any chance of peace talks. Let’s hope the bounty now on his head is collected!
Love Rusia ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️👍
Hopefully they have peace
I think putin's plan was not to rule Ukraine but just wanted to flex muscles and use Ukraine as an example to other non-nato members of what he will do them if they try,,unfortunately Ukraine's cities have been damaged and many displaced,may people heal from this!
I trust Putin literally as far as i can throw him. He just wants a ceasefire so he can advance his gain
Shitty reporting, they would not tell a single condition in entire 2 min long video.  What a pity!!
Remove all sanctions Agree not to join NATO Give back all seized things to oligarches **GIVE 2022 F1 WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP TO SIR MAZEWIN**
Talk after talk is the same thing, Putin's security demand will not meet Ukraine's demand too. They should come up with some source of compromise to end the war permanently.
WON"T HAPPEN! Nuke Putin Now!
NATO's should be destroyed immediately
Nothing new in this report.  Unusual as wion is usually good. Support Ukraine  🇺🇦👍☮️🇺🇦👍☮️ 🌲😢☘️
Disappointed with this woman report no substance to her report, what are the conditions? She keeps repeating herself on useless talk.
What gives him the right to be setting conditions? Is he some kind of god or something? This little man is a ruthless killer, and a war criminal.Go back home Putin, and take care of your own people who need help.
Qajo1.???.
Good putin
Demands are impossible for Ukraine to agree too
Does that little man think that he can demand anything after killing so many innocent people.  He must be fried. Toast the self Important thug.
For Ukraine to stop fighting? That's impossible since Russian troops are still boots on ground in Ukraine. Moscow's demands are met? That's also impossible, it means the world has to follow Putin's desire for dictatorship.
This was repetitive for no good reason
Vlad: "Capitulate or die!"  Volod: "Gofuck yourselves!"  Blammo, baby.  Cheers!
Screw this dude
The Crazy Zelensky! That’s the fruit of your ambition!
She said same thing 20 times ....what a joke .this is dumb station to get any news from
The Ukraine could stipulate these demands:  1. An immediate ceasefire and the total withdrawal of all Russian troops from Ukraine. 2. Reparations for the death and destruction Putin has caused. 3. The return of Crimea and two breakaway regions to Ukraine. 4. The removal of Putin from power. 5. The arrest and imprisonment of Putin while he awaits trial at the Hague for Crimes Against Humanity.
What BS? If Ukraine gives up then Russia will cease trying to destroy Ukraine and then a of Russia's demands must be complied with then there will be peace.  Such BS is typical of Russian dictators.
A copy of the "conditions" to end the war in Ukraine has been obtained: Zelensky: "Okay Mr Putin, we have your forces surrounded. You may surrender, drop all your weapons, and return to Russia unharmed. If you do not surrender, the Ukrainian army will be forced to destroy you". Putin: "Shto"?!
sorry bt turky is not NATO member
If he's not careful, this conflict might put the conditions to end Putin.
It's an operation in Ukraine, duh.
Can't understand her accent!
He wants to end it because he’s running out of money and he’s losing his grip on his country hahaha 😂😂😂
The whole world demands from Putin to bring back innocent lives who are died in his Invasion .
Why was it the largest number of refugee evacuation? Because All oher countries that were being bombed, the refugees were forced to leave by boats, and the "numbers" were Never given.  As far too many innocent Children died because The West did NOT help them. And the question we Must ask.... is WHY??? (MY ANSWER IS:  "Blue Eyes Blonde Hair").
HOW DOES SOMEONE WITH EVIL INTENTIONS IN THE NAME OF "DENAZIFICATION" AND HAS DIRECTED WAR CRIMES, PUT CONDITIONS TO END CONFLICT..??  ARE THOSE THOUSANDS OF DEMOS IN RUSSIA NAZIS.??
What demands? Could this video have been any worse? Outside of saying the Ukraine has to stop shooting fist, there was no other “demands”
So Covid19 & its protocols just disappeared because of the war - interesting.
Bombing schools, hospitals, and villages.  Leveling cities. Indiscriminate murder of civilians.  Raping and murdering women.  The perpetrators have hammered the nails in their own coffin.  All that's left is time.  Good will conquer evil and the willingness to fight for freedom is a war that even Russia cannot win!  No matter how many children are slaughtered, no matter how many bombs are dropped, Russias leaders have plunged their own country into what will become a backwards moving hellhole like the rest of the authoritarian regimes in history.
ukraine is a free country not a colony of Russian. they are free to be where they choose to be. neto or no neto.
NO NO U STOPPED  U INVITED  U  EVIL
Where the hell are the demands as per your headline? I hate such half hearted news
o poutin den masai apo auta 😂
Bravo Russia URaaa
GET TRUTH OUT NOW!  THE ONLY AGENDA GOING ON FOR OVER 6 DECADES IS...THE FOOD OF ETERNAL LIFE!!" OUR CHILDREN!! WORLDWIDE FOR THE EVIL INBRED BLOODLINES AND THEIR SEED....THEY WANT ALL TO CONFORM TO THEM...OR THEY WILL DIE!!  OR GO BACK TO THE UNDER WORLD THEY CREATED UNTIL WE DO!  SLAY THESE MONSTERS NOW!  AND THE INFLUX OF IMMORAL SEED CREATED TO BE THERE SOLDIERS! ANTIFA! ISIS! HISBOLLAH! GERILLAS! ALL CABAL/CARTEL/CIA/MOB... THE MAFIAS OF THE WORLD!  THERE TIME IS UP!  OUR CHILDREN NEED US NOW! BE AWARE IN YOU OWN TOWN CITY STATE...VILLAGE ARE CHILDREN CRYING FOR HELP!!
I mean it's obvious what they want but you didn't report any news just repeating your headline.
If it brings peace hear him out and if agreeable stop fighting but if Putin is demanding anything to keep soldiers in Ukraine keep on fighting, as you will have nothing to lose but your country and identity.
Improve your phonetics and then i will watch your channel
🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦❤
India just bought weapons from Russia !  Unsubscribe from this channel !
you didn't even say the demands.
Moscow's demands will never be met.
Let Putin hear what Ukrainians said and Putin will never forget the voices of Ukrainians til the end of his day.
Erdogan probably said, don't cut my Gas off. Two peas in a pod
It is peace keeping economical operation 🙂
Erdoghan is afraid of the US. Russia's conditions are perfectly reasonable.
It's time to end this war and restore peace And Russia needs to help rebuild Ukraine In every expense This time is now God is challenging our hearts It doesn't matter who you are and where you are Everyone time to restore peace everlasting peace Where is the love for one another Where is the love for one another
Stand Ukraine!!
Gee, thanks for explaining what the demands are.  Literally the only reason I clicked on this.  Everyone knows full well that Russia wants its demands met.
By doing racism with Africans, Indians and Chinese students...Ukraine has lost all hope... Russia successfully averts US n EU pressure while China, SA, India etc have refused because of the rascism
Putin is scared to start world war 3...he is only treatend of his nuke....fucking old folks...😇😇
The only way to end this, is to end putin permantley!
A legend in his own Metaverse.  🤪👉🇷🇺
Putin's conditions are a joke. The Ukrainians would rather die than bow tho the whims of a maniacal dictator like him. And of course, Putin is a known liar and he will likely just wipe out the Ukrainians if given half the chance.  Fight, Ukraine!
Just announce the conditions instead of repeating that news
thats very sensible Mr. Putin, hope ukraine agrees to ur demands
Stop saying he set conditions. Say what those conditions are youve already said there SET that means you know what they are. What are they?. Thats what i thought
Ckick bait. Nothing was informed here. Nothing !
Putin has no right to set conditions. Kinda like a child abuser dictating terms and conditions to a court of law.
Putin conditions are worth less than the rouble , the man is a liar to even his own people,  Russia and putin is over , dead man walking
Here are our conditions.     You resign as President and take all of your advisors with you.   You are no longer in power.        That's it simple as that.   OR we will continue and increase our sanctions until your people remove you from power.
" Dont listen to the communist  Watch carefully to what they have done " . Note : Putin is a former KGB communist now turn into a russian Adolf Hitler .
Moscows demand is to make Ukraine a puppet state of Russia just like Belarus. Thats what they want.
Unacceptable.  Withdraw Or Die....   You Cannot Win.   For Generations You Will Suffer. Death and Economic Destruction. For What you Have Done
Here’s are conditions for Putin. Get out of Ukraine, pay for all the devastation to Ukraine, and turn yourself in front stand trial for war crimes.
Meet the conditions……keep the NATO agreement.  Follow guidelines of the Minsk agreement.  Keep your word.
There conditions are shit!! RUSSIA IS THE ONE THAT INVADED THEY NEED TO STOP THE FIGHTING, THEY STARTED THE WAR, UKRAINE IS ONLY DEFENDING THEMSELVES.  2nd Ukraine should not have demilitarize because Putin doesnt like others having a military. UKRAINE HAS EVERY RIGHT TO DEFEND THEMSELVES AND NEEDS A MILTITARY!!!  3rd its Ukraines choice to join the EU or Nato, its not up to Russia or anyone else, its Ukraines choice!!! Russia has no say!!! 4th NATO has every right to deploy troops to eastern Europe, because you the asshole who keeps building up his military along there borders!! Nato will not withdraw troops for eastern Europe 5th Ukraine chose to be democracy not a puppet from moscow, once again its Ukraines choice for what they see is best for there country, Zelensky is doing an amazing job leading his country atm, keep it up!!!  PUTIN YOUR PIECE OF SHIT!!! YOUR PSYCHOTIC YOU NEED TO BE STOPPED!!!
Why don’t someone take Putin out end of problem for Russian citizens and Ukraine
Media be like: Lets do promotions as much as possible whatever may be the circumstances.
Count down  starts  to  Russia  pity  to people   of  Russia
Is Russia going to pay for the damage it caused? how could you pay for someone's life? Is Putin going to be punished as a war criminal?
Why not state what are Putins demands ??? DeNazifaction and Demilitarisation
now now   Lets all be HONEST here...If Ukraine would have simply joined up with Russia, they could ALL have a bigger and better empire and could have avoided all the bloodshed and destruction...Ukraine could have also avoided the slow destruction of their country, by continuing on the path of liberalism and corruption that is turning America and its allies into unlivable hellholes, where the decent people are forced to retreat from area to area, because the corrupt government keeps moving lowlifes into their neighborhoods
Is Putin playing a terrorist role now?? As if Ukraine is under hostage, and no will to fight??He must be arrested for war crimes instead!
DEMONIC PUTIN.
wish that said meeting  it could create lights to bring them into the better way goes to the dead end of war.
I already said that Erdoğan is the middle man, now give me a 👍
Putin is working hard to stop major catastrophic for the entire region Ukraine comedian president acted as a puppet of West and NATO to bring this crisis to entire world
Russia is right
putin sould pay everything he has destroyed Ukrainians properties and lives .
Get out of ukraine and they will stop fighting. Easier, no ??
The Bully sets stipulations for peace...lol
This clip just repeats nothingness over and over. 🤔😂 What are the demands reporter lady? It would help if they were mentioned at least once.
Trying to figure out the point of this video!
Lots of Russian bots in here. We all know better. No one supports Putin no one that’s not evil that is.
Let the sanction be on
What are the Moscow demands???? Lol what a shame
How do you stop fighting the Russian when they are inside your Country killing civilians?  Ukraine will stop fighting them if they go back to Russia.   What kind of condition did Putin demanding?
what conditions ? give up the country & get on the knees ?
When will it end tired of looking at the same again and again I just want the after math ,as how the world will move a new beginning is on light( I'm in no ones side).
Russians must be blind that's normal, when your President shooted out the Light. Beware:  Night Wolves only come in the Dark.
The condition that the Ukrainian farmers who keeps stealing the Russian tanks return them because it is making the Russians look like a bunch of Clowns.  Even more so than the russian soldiers clowned themselves when they sold their gas in Belarus for some Vodka and Maccas.
Slava Ukraini!
I dont think he is in a position to ask anything
Don’t worry Ukrainians will end this war with Putin is a way it should be settled!!!
Why would anyone trust anything the murderer Putin says ?
Russia Rocks
No way
DEMANDS??????????????
Putin invades and Putin demands condition to end?  It’s like the robbers come to our house and demand we hand over all our money and access to our bank account .  The cops  ( the UN and NATO) watch our house and do nothing.  The UN should be dissolved.  There should not be two robbers sitting on the board of bank directors.
Stopping NATO expansion would have prevented this.
Putin planning to surrender now.
I think moscow's invasion is going to slowly crawl to an end by it's own accord. They are getting beat hard, and the risk is outweighing the reward by a lot by now I'm sure. I just seen a video from a ukrainian channel where they filmed putin's next shipment of military vehicles by train... it looks like scrap metal with Z's painted on the side of them. Very old and well used trucks and cars. looks rough.
What are Moscows demands?..
Nothing come out that man mouth can be trusted 😂😂😂
WHAT ABOUT THE WAR CRIMES THAT WERE COMMITTED
Not only has he b**** slapped the United States un and NATO and showed just how inept and how milk toast and weak they truly are. Now he's setting and giving ultimatums to these little b****** in the military. Should the American people take away the trillions of dollars that the military industrial complex gets every year because they're all show and no go???
Let's all hope this ends as soon as possible!
We Indians always support Russia 🇷🇺
What demands?  He wants a personal ass massage from Zalinsk?  please ??
Putin must be removed from power and turned over to The Hague.
You're full of B.S. also.. This is a planned Agenda and the World is waking up to it !
So invader can act with such arrogance setting demands. In my opinion Putin should be arrested for war crime, Russia must compensate all costs and loss to Ukraine.
click bait!
?????
Putin wants control of Ukraine, are you willing to lie down your firearms and give in?  If not the war goes on.
You didn’t specify Moscow’s demands. Why not?
How can you stop fighting if they're attacking you is not fighting is self defense Russia sure go to hell and live Ukraine alone that's the only way to stop the war
How is this news?  Of course the war could stop under conditions. What are the conditions he has set?
Are we calling the entire country of Russia Moscow now?
Putins conditions should be considered but only on the basis that Russia will agree to end all present and future incursions, militarily -  by proxy or otherwise, and politically, into Ukraine - that is unless Ukraine initiates hostilities toward Russia. Ukraine must also understand, and agree, the west will not assist them in any way should they initiate hostilities toward Russia. Prior to the decision to initiate hostilities, by either side (Russia or Ukraine), they must present to the UN Security Council their evidence to justify their intended actions and first make a  serious effort to seek a diplomatic path to achieve a peaceful solution.
Stop *FKG* saying invasion. If what *America* and *NATO* have been and are still doing to brown people for the past 20+ years is *NOT "invasion"* then what Russia has done is likewise an *"""intervention"""*
The only condition, the Russian leave Ukraine immediately.
blah blah blah, nothing said of so called "demands"............bunch of hot air WION is
Seems kinda funny he's so tilted by 'sanctions' when they didn't care about them in the first place.  Also bully logic for negotiations smh. I do acknowledge that he has his country's priorities but in the end he went about ignoring the interests of others.
What are the conditions
After this war arrest putin for several war crimes and deaths
Il say do it. Live to fight another day. NATO can’t do the no fly zone so… live to fight another day for the people who are loosing their lives
what are those demands?
HEY PUTIN :):):) YOU PASSED THE POINT OF PUTTING CONDITIONS :):):):)
Putin has finally to act like a adult, but he still need to put in jail for his crime.
Also Putin is saying look if we keep bombing don't say we tried to give y'all a way out to Ukraine but why would Ukraine want to be under Russia ruler ship y'all give in it will set china up to invade next and hope Taiwan tap out
He is trying to end it funny how everyone else wants to keep this going
Putin and his demands :(    There is only one 1 way for this dictator and mass murderer..... In the end it will be hell. What a fool.
What are the demands? I believe the demands will be 'Ukraine come under Russian control' , the fighting will go on for weeks, months and maybe even years! Putin is the son of Adolf Hitler I'm sure
So, in other words, completely surrender, and bow to your new overlords. Um, no, the Ukrainians don't want to become your slaves.
Lies, Putin is not going to stop.
how long would it take for  me to get citizenship so i can fight for Ukrain 👀
So what are the demands...?
I rather die for my country then let Putin run my life how ever he wants STRAIGHT UP even if I have to strap bombs to my body and take a few Russians with me but I would not be a slave to them smfh so my prayers go to Ukraine 🇺🇦 ppl you guys deserve freedom like us USA USA USA 🇺🇸🤘🏼💪🏼
Fist bump fail for Puttie
It's because they haven't said their demands. I think russia is making the conditions now since they are trying to send a message to nato
praying for DIVINE INTERVENTION in the mighty name of Jesus Amen 🙏
Putin is fearing......
Putin will win.
Sooooo-what are the conditions??????
Why repeat the same thing over and over and not even state the damands… this is supposed to be msm…. That’s why yt will replace everything.
He’s lying! If the Ukrainians cease fighting he will quickly take over the country.
Moscow's demand is to respect and keep agreements. That is nothing unusual.
Conflict wouldn't have started .... If Ukraine stayed neutral. Now it's given opportunity to  putin to  demand nato to push back it's .. borders. ... 😂😂 Dum president will have his freedom and independence after everything is destroyed n everyone dies.
Love me or hate me putin is my hero and he knows what he is doing
The russian soldiers need to attack moscow and remove the only true enemy of the russian people , namely Putin .
No to Russias demands nd jus go home
Putin says, Kill them all.
So he invades then makes demands?  Yeah he can go pound sand.
🇮🇳❤️🇷🇺
Top story - an hour long telephone conversation that led to nothing.
Well, what are the damned conditions, this video is worthless
Pls put real news on what happened in Ukraine u are puppets of western media they are giving more valuable items to put Ukraine is greatly game changer   WION you have international standards pls visit russia today and give us real news we want to here both sides
I bet he wants to end it in since this started Russia has been looking weaker everyday.
India silence is like Chinese complicity’s western world should not forget these
Hello, braves Ukrainians! Please, don t fight against your russians brothers ; they are far to much strong. You will only make a worse situation, and make this war longer, because you also are strong, and if so, many casualties, and especialy the weakers, as in every to long war. And this is EXACTLY what otan wants, and they will not helping you at all, they stay hidden warm at home, easy home sweet home, waiting for you fight and kill eachother between Slavic people, just after otan themeselves have lighting this bloody shiting fire in your Country! They also order those neo-nazis who stole the politic power to firing bombs on their own civilians people, as since 8 years! And this is a sadly improve technic of human shield, used by CIA IN Syrie, to charge in accusation the adversary. It is signed. They want to use YOU , don t be foolish, protect yourself and your family, friends ,just don t fight , don t answer to your nuts illegitime president surrounded by nazis, whose so irresponsible that he s not hesitate  to risk a 3 world war!!!!! don t fall in that trap, brothers and sisters, I m begging you  !! with all my love and concern PAIX SHANTI PEACE
Ucrania um vizinho traíra como conviver com um vizinho traíra
They must nor join NATO or European Union period.
bias journalism
So Putin is wanting the US and NATO to uphold the original agreement and the Budapest Agreement? Seems reasonable...🤷🏻‍♀️
What are the demands then?
peace is acceptable at all cost.
so what are they ?
The only good communist Russian soldier is one that has an entry wound thru it’s head.
Get rid of Puttin
💕💕💕 PEACE PLEASE 💕💕💕
The demands are : Recognise Crimea. Recognise DNR and LNR. Declare neutral status. Deny nazi ideology and remove nazi officials and control from ukraine politic, education etc.
Putin : I want your boots , your pants and your Motorcycle Ukraine: You forgot to say please NATO: How do we get out of this mental asylum
Good news   just for child and women and citizen of that country good steps
It ends with Putin's death, not before.
DONT GIVE IN GOD IS WITH YOU UKRAIN DONT GIVE IN TO EVIL
Russia MUST occupy Ukraine
Putin cant be trusted, its like when they made their "corridor" to allow civilians to escape the fighting, then started to bomb the civs... so if Ukraine stops figting the russian troops will move in and kill them all.  Only way to stop this is to remove putin from power, sadly, hes a great leader but hes losing it.
Time for the free world to counter attack with the truth !
What about this deal, Vladmir Putin is denounced as leader of the Russian Federation. Alexandr The Experiment Karin is put in place.
His demands aren’t even important. How much money will it cost to rebuild that country.  That’s what he should be worried about.  There is a finacial value on everything.
Glory to Ukraine! The Russian military is clearly a disgrace. They are not as strong as we thought they were. What did we miss before the Ukraine war? The bombing and complete decimation of Aleppo. Those actions showed Russian weaknesses. They couldn’t do anything else but bomb. What a disgrace!
That’s crazy, Putin wants Ukraine to stop fighting, lay down their arms, in other words, and accept Russian conditions for the conflict to stop. That sounds like surrender to me. Ukraine will never do this, as long as Russian foot soldiers set foot on Ukrainian soil. If Putin wants Ukraine to stop fighting, he should send his forces home. Get the fu*k out of Ukraine Putin. 🇺🇦
What are the conditions ma'am? What kind of reporting is this?🤣
You need to rebuild Ukraine
The world have to admit that Puttin is a cold blooded murdera
The English translation of what Putin said: Surrender Unconditionally and hope that I won’t kill you and your family and all your friends too! Those are very generous terms!
Only "terrorists" set demands.
The video didn't specify the demand of Moscow
Putin you might as well fight to the last man because no one’s wants to be a part of Russia 🇷🇺
This sounds like a typical Indian News clip.. Trying to say same sentence in different combinations of the words.
0:39 brofist? :D
Russian Generals need to put putin down .. this is hurting Russians as well as other countries not just Ukraine
Don’t fold Europe. People don’t have the right to intimidate country’s to get what thy want. Let him keep fighting and it will make him weaker. Once it does the whole  world comes at him at once and take them out. A dictator is going to stop. He might pull back but once he get more help and recovers he will do it again.
Encourage Erdogan 🙏.
Well this is going to be a long war.
Fucking useless news service. Didn't explain anything
Only a fool would believe anything that Putin has to say.
Condition 1: Stop fighting Condition 2: Hand over Ukraine Condition 3: Stop people from asking me why all my rival candidates have ended up dead, imprisoned or poisoned.
Close all talks with Putin all of their statements are bullshit.  Start making demands.
Whatever happens Putin still has to be called to court
Israel Is Arming Ukraine's Blatantly Neo-Nazi Militia the Azov Battalion.  These are military personnel that is part of the Ukraine that are attacking Russians!
What kind of fukin demand is that? The whole thing is about taking over and resistant!! Man!! Send the boys and let this mfer know we ain’t no punks!!!!
So no deal. Ha stop fighting and give them what to the Russians
I just unsubscribed because you included the opinion of the UN but not what Russia's demands are . Your a puppet media, and just got removed from my feed
the nuclear will happen ..if the Ukraine "нет упорный и заход авиации НАТО в Украину "
This is not a "conflict" - this is a war on Ukraine. Ukrainians are not "fighting" they have no choice but defend themselves. Putin does not think, will never think, and never thought that Ukrain deserved to be separate from Russia. In fact, he is acting like a toddler who's tower if blocks just got knocked over.
Ukraine is a sovereign country, how they are not allowed to associate and make pacts to defend themselves or deal with their internal affairs within their country?  Sounds like a pethetic excuses for a bully to have such demands.  Why would Ukraine want to join Nato, Crimia and this invasion are examples of why countries want to join NATO.
the common man - I want food/job and peace with family Politician - I want to make this country the greatest and the largest and make it bigger and bigger at any cost.  If only the common man can win everywhere. We are in a global era with Individualism at its peak and yet we have imperialistic behavior shown by all the powerful countries.
this video is such a fail not actually telling what the demands are, or at least clarifying by saying that they haven't been made public, or that they're just the prior demands. crucial info with crucial timing
Blah blah blah, what a waste of "news". Nothing new said whatsoever.
putin is a known LIAR! He may be one of the richest men on earth but his body is worth nothing more then fertilizer
Russia demand is legitimate and reasonable. It's the big bully from the West who is pushing him to no option + stupid Ukraine President who is willing to be used by the West. If Ukraine is not sitting next to Russia, the West won't even look at the country if it doesn't have any benefits to the West. Why ppl can't see this? Ukrainian needs to back off, then there a room to talk
Putin is killer and butcher. Nobody should trust him .
The world is one in Freedom of and for people. You seem to have left that out of your mission statement.
AND WHAT ARE THE DEMANDS??? useless reporting!!!!
Putin is afraid of an attack on Russia? Or, Putin sees Ukraine becoming a more profitable nation with freedoms Russians can't dream of and the truth spreading in Russia. Nobody has any interest in attacking Russia. Most people do think Russia will drift towards freedom and closer ties with the West as Putin ages.
In one condition that russia must will be the owner of ukraine that can  fully dictate its leader and sovereignty.
NATO should close the skies and call it their special military operation that will give befitting reply to this coward putin
Can't trust the Russians. Until now all they have done is lie.
PUTIN is rapidly losing support in Russia. He needs to achieve an end to sanctions = DEMAND and to be VICTORIOUS = COWARD. Putin is Mentally Unstable refusing to take his treatment, Lithium Carbonate, for his Bipolar Disease/Manic Depression.
Ukrain first stop fighting like whaat!??.....there tjust defending brother😅
RUSSIA WAS BEING CUT OUT OF WORLD  so he has no option than to ceasefire😂
Well, sounds like Mr.Putin’s war is really biting him in the ass. The Ukrainian people will NOT lay down their weapons. The window is closing on this op as the weather warms amour will be useless.
Yeah now that he realized it's way harder to conquer Ukraine than he initially thought he suddenly wants a compromise 😂
Great news, praise our Lord.  It's already hard enough in our country that the people only care about themselves and engage in criminal activity to get what they want.  It's a shame they do not care at all about the Ukranian people but only how they are affected at the pump.  Sending 💕 and 🙏
Ignore him he's a pathological liar.
Worthless clip
Let's talk about the level 4 bio labs that Putin destroyed in Ukraine, and why.
This conflict was avoidable if Ukraine has a competent government. Election has consequences.
Aggression is Aggressuon.Shame your self.
Only if we win and we keep?
hahaha, only an idiot would believe putin!!!
Already lives lost, cities destroyed, I wonder what's to salvage now with flimsy demands, what an idiot 🤦
"Full surrender, or we continue" - typical Putin!
u Puttin who u wat demand u want met u think u is God
TWO FOX IN THE SAME HOLE NOT T BE TRUSTED.....
Putin acts like Russia is the victim. Smh.  Their demands are insanity and Zelenskyy ain’t gonna sell out. He’s & Ukrainians have been an inspiration.
ন্যাটো এবং আমেরিকাকে অবশ্যই পুরবদিকে আসা বনদ করতে হবে।
It seems to me a bully is still a bully. Why does a country have to have a pact with another to Aid in the defense of a weaker country?  If a student is getting bullied at school other students have a choice which is to simply walk away or to step in.  The bully must be met head-on because if not today that bully will come for you tomorrow.  Uncle Joe you're a sad representation of a government, of a people compared to Ukrainian President Zelenskyy.  On the other hand you walk on water when compared to dum-dum 45  Putin is a COWARD
American army lost 100s army personnel in afganistan and killed ten's of thousands of population in war and In comparison with Ukraine 1000army personal against few hundred of people  This shows the difference between the two army  And now they call it war crime
"They’re not “Sanctions” they’re special economic conditions." I love this comment so much for so many reasons, anyway lets talk about the real issue here.    President Vladimir Putin, with all due respect, this world doesn't want war. We KNOW who is Russia. We know their people, we know about their language and culture. We MAKE MISTAKES too. But we must work things out with peace and justice.   Yes, you have your valid concerns but we have ours too. This world has more countries in it. In a future of COURSE Russia should be in it. War only hurts more people, prolongate hate and racism. War throws away the future of this world.   I enjoy seeing world competition against to Chess Russian players. I enjoy seeing Russians getting those world medals in the Olympics. I enjoy when the world accepts the challenge posed by a Russian mathematician. THERE IS NO future without Russia. How many Russian composers we have that contributed to classical music. Who can forget Sergei Rachmaninoff?   In a world war all of this will be thrown away too. We always negotiate peace but we have a place in this world too. Remember that.
people of ukrain dnt let this stupid putin  rule your govt.he want to resign your president  for his favor after what he did to ukrain killed those children. and destroy your homes and all govt facilities. make your life more missirable.start to nothing.only selensky can  bring love  not idiot putin. militarization  to.make people of ukrain like a robot.
What are the demands?
Any nuclear releases from Ukraine reactors held by Russia should be seen as an attack by Russia against all of Europe and NATO.
Did you guys edit out the content from this video before you posted it? Can you post what you edited out ?
He's a LIAR... WHERE'S THE HERO WITH HIS BULLET??? >>>NO ONE<<< WILL MISS HIS EVIL SPIRIT🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
There are only losers in a war.
The apocalypse is God's business, but if Europe wants the apocalypse first, that's my business. Lord Put1n
No Nato for Ukraine.
WHAT ARE THE CONDITIONS???
We need to stop Russian oil and gas sales
all Russian news writes that Putin declared the conditions of demilitarisation and denamination of Ukraine , and that we fight only with the nationalist's  forces as "Azov" and "Adar" , but the question is if those troops are private ( they are not  a part of official Ukraine army also as those troops that officially are fighting on the  side of Russia ) why they destroy the official  military objects and the factories , and airports .
Crazy Putin, Ukraine and the civilised world will never accept your ridiculous demands.
He already said " Like it or not bear it Beauty"""
It’s incredible how one unhinged murderer terrorizes the whole world. Are you ready to comply with Putins “demands”? This is what consequence of unpunished crimes looks like.
If Russia’s demands are met then the Russian sanctions should kept in place, till Ukraine is back to what it was. And China gets some sort of sanctions as well, for aiding and betting Russia. No to Russia taking over Ukraine and putting a puppet government in its place.
@zero,, they are neither, it's Putin's idea,, you can't issue ultimatums,, and then demand ransom! That's a war crime!
Moscow wants NATO to cease its expansion and Ukraine to remain neutral,that’s it. Is it so hard to understand for ukrainian prez,he thought NATO will come to their rescue,but so many innocents lost their lives because of this comedian cum state leader.
Putin is starting to see that the invasion is not gonna be a walkover
Why Turkey didn't raise concerns when Iraq and Afghanistan was invaded by US and NATO?? US must be sanctioned first, if Russia has to!!
Sooooooooooo what are the conditions???
So pretty much what Russia is saying. "Ukraine needs to have an unconditional surrender or we will keep killing you." Putin is playing a larger game than what we are actually seeing. I find it hard to believe that Putin hadn't expected so much resistance from Ukraine. He is being strategic. I believe that Putin's threats of Nuclear war is just a bully flexing his muscles. He knows that no one, even him, would want a nuclear war. That would be the end of life on earth. I hope I am right anyway.  As long as Putin keeps threatening Nuclear war the west will try and stay out of it. I believe Putin knows that too.
That's just another way of saying "we will keep the killing going" while trying to make it sound peaceful and understanding.  He said Ukraine and Russia are the same people.... helluva way to treat your "own people"
Russias demands are pretty much unconditional surrender and loss of the country as a seperate state though right? Didn't they also demand other counties leave NATO.. yea good luck.
That's saying nothing.  Ukraine can't stop fighting first, or they'd be slaughtered.
The condition probability to make Ukraine as buffer zone for NATO. Because Russia clearly don't won't any nuclear weapons stationed in their border. That's if Putin still sensible but who knows what the the real owner of this conflict the globalist swamp dwellers and the great steppe mobs really arguing on
Suppose they can’t tell us what the demands are.
Interesting ... its a good/positive sign, deaths will stop for now ? Right ? 👍🙏 ... but dont let your guard down just yet 🤔
Does Putin have anything to lose?
Rasputin.
Thanks to Tayeb Ardagan & Puttin For Coming On table talk.
All the people who are so excited to go to War with Russia are very Stupid people they forget in a World War they gonna be dead and all of their Love ones so stop the Stupidity and use Common sense
The history of Russia is war after war after another. It seems to be in the blood of the politicians. Seems to always be about the Mother Russia mentality.
The leader of the free world 🇷🇺🇷🇺
Schaut euch mal das Video an von Klitschko NPD Partei wo Muslime Steinmeier auch zu sehen ist
When the Soviet Union collapsed the thing that surprised me most was that Russia allowed Ukraine to break away. I had always assumed it was a part of Russia. I was badly mistaken.
The thing that sucks is all those Russian soldiers who have shown extreme restraint against Ukranians who are brave, but their commanders are getting the worst verbal abuse. If they start shooting angry crowds is because their commanders are getting shit bigtime. I have met Russians who were soldiers and they are cool, that is what I am saying. It is Putin ordering them or they are dead.
That's nice meeting nice to hear something precisely
Women, -put aside that Ukrain has to stop fighhtng, what are the other demans..?
Bidi bidi bidi bidi
Sounds like Putin saying I won the war give up and basically nothing change what Putin wanted lol he's just trying to take over Ukraine with out having to rebuild the hole country with his broke ass 😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆.... But na Putin no he's broke and can't afford the war why give in 😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆
The channel doesn’t know what they spoke on phone exactly
This is horrible,My heart goes out to the civilians!.😭💔🇺🇦🙏
Good news  am happy now we need peace.
There is already a peace agreement between Russia and Ukraine
I dont trust putin in terms of keeping the peace...after destroying most of the cities in ukraine he wants to set conditions he must be crazy....putin sbould end the invasion without any demands..
The adults in the room.
What are moscows demands ffs tell us

If Russia stops war, there'll be peace, if Ukraine stops war, there'll be no Ukraine.
He probably just wants a sandwich
I say let Russians suffer from the sanctions a while longer. The Ukrainians are putting up a good fight and making the Russian military look feeble outside of their indiscriminate missile and rocket attacks against civilian population centers and nuclear power plants. Once the Oligarchs and everyday Russians begin to feel the pain, maybe Putin will be compelled to back out of Ukraine or risk someone putting a bullet to his head.
Coward bully on this play...putin had to massacre all ukrainians to make his point...but still lose in the war...he had started...better to save face now while he can by pulling out of ukraine immidiately with out preconditions...who  do u think is he: god...he is just further tarnishing russia and the russian people's image to beyond repair...it is for the russian people to stop and kick out their so called leader...how can they stomach these atrocities against the people they called their owned brethren...enough is enough...get out of ur senses and don't obey the orders of ur tyrant leaders...go to the streets or stay inside ur homes as a sign of protest...refuse to work and be sent to the frontlines or to other places to be stationed if u are a russian soldier...because it is not ur nature to trample upon the rights and freedom of others...😜😜😜😝😝😝💝💝💝💖💖💖
Russian demands: 1. Ukraine stops fighting, so russia forces can loot and rape in peace 2. Next countries to be attacked should leave NATO - Poland, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia. That only applies if Ukraine surrenders, otherwise russia will not have enough forces anyway...
Mate, very disappointed with India's tipee toe no action against Russia.
@prisonmike  Yes we do..and no matter what IT has to Be done.  Do I fear for My job and affects on My Life..yes I do think those things.  But madman have to Be stopped and world have come through greater crisis and came up stronger.
United States should have did more to stop Russia's invasion this guy is like Hitler
Why is Putin so obsessed with Ukraine joining NATO? Does it make sense that a strong and powerful country could invade a free nation anytime,everywhere? Sovereignty of a nation must be respected. Putin has no right to run the world
So Putin's demands are what to Ukraine? Surrender? Give up? Let Russia overtake you? Hell no!
What are MOSCOW’s DEMANDS?
Putin can go to hell and stay there. The only way Russia can get out of this war and rejoin the international community is a Russian coup when Putin is deposed and arrested waiting for trial the way Milosevic did and Russia withdraws from all Ukraine, including Crimea, along with war reparation to Ukraine. Otherwise, Russia is a new North Korea.
If the west understood 10 years back that they can't enter into another country's sphere of influence, there wouldn't be a need to show force like Russia did. In the end, the common people suffer.
He went into the people them country and now that his plan failed he wants them to stop fighting the Ukrainian should crush them all like ants
wait a minute..why should Ukraine stop fighting? who is attacking who? Putin is  corrupt and evil..his grip on power is loosening and he is scared shit..the whole world hates him, even his own countryman hates him, and he knows it..the whole world should punish him for this war crimes. Salva Ukraine !! 🌻🌻🌻
Bsdiwala turkey drone supply krta hai or bakchodi Russia mai Jake pail rha 😁
🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏 Peace Philippines
Ukraine should just surrender
I will stop the war if you accept my conditions.
And those conditions would be. . . .
May NATO and the globalist bankers rot in Hell for inciting this.
We must not negotiate with terrorists
Do not trust that man. A false peace treaty means nothing to him. His word is worthless.
Stop fighting.
I hope Ukraine doesn't fall for that shit. They didn't start the war. You don't stop defending yourself till your attacker stops fighting. Plain and simple
Vladimir Putler YOU HAVE NOTHING TO SAY. WE RULE OVER YOU
what are the Moscow's demands?
You forgot to mention what the conditions were....
clickbait at its finest
Wtf are the conditions?? Wate of time watching this video..
What a clown !
Time to give Russia a black eye
Ukrainian should counter demand that Putin give himself a cranial lead injection. Do this or we will send your boys home in boxes.
Surrender n be my slaves or fight n be free. Hes braindead really
So, what are Putins conditions? Your title is very misleading, you fail.
So what happened to the coronavirus infection?
Dictator making dictator demands.
well that didnt tell me anything.. what specifically are putins demands ?  maybe like NO FUCKING NATO BASES NEXT TO RUSSIA . . or something?
We need peaceful 🇬🇲❤️💯
Before this war I had respect for Putin leadership but not now..
Long live Russia .India Russia Bhai bhai
Absolutely unacceptable
Worthless video
"When Ukraine stops fighting" = surrendering. And of course war ends when someone surrenders.
Selfishness leads to hatted towards eachother
Stuff Putins demands
Russian "demands" are the reason for invasion. It doesn't make sense. Putin doesn't want to compromise.
don't be friendly to nato... elect a pro russian govt. give donetsk and luhansk freedom...   Did I miss anything???
If I were the former stand up comic running the show in Ukraine I would take the deal.
Now the world knows how weak his military is and overrated his so called high techs military hardware. It's ripe to invade Russia and take control this nation's military and it's weapons.
Happy to hear ❤️
How about "no," Vladimir?
putin is now rulling whole world!
Yup...this is how WW3 starts.
What are those demands?...
Well, what does he want?
Adolf Putin is so goofy. He’s in no position to be making demands. There might be just one; as a war criminal, his choice of firing squad or hanging.
Thank you Lord for peace agreement! The world is praying for world peace.
So give you there country🙄🙄🙄
So there will be no peace Ukraine will not obey the Russian amendments
From Wikipedia:  The World is One News (WION) is an Indian multinational[1] English language news channel headquartered in New Delhi.[2] It is owned by the Essel Group and is part of the Zee Media network of channels.[3] According to Indian news magazine The Week, the channel "covers global news and current affairs from an Indian perspective".[4]
Putin is not to be trusted.
So many dumbass comments lol you all need a history lesson and not from MSM
so i guess all out nuclear war is the only option .. well exept if you give a dictator his commands
Useless waste of time, does not say what r putins demands
What people don’t understand is “this is Putin’s war and he would stop at nothing until he either wins or destroy Ukraine with every ammunition he has”. All this sanctions and the rest would only affect Russia and its people but Putin is very intelligent and crazy which makes him dangerous and at advantage.
No details given, and the video clips play the same thing over and over.
Lol this man with a war on Ukraine made Russia look so weak Trump would of rocked putons world yo
Whats a Telephony conversation?
Russia: Give up & do what we tell you.  Ukraine: No
East Europeans will NEVER stop fighting. The Russian communist hydra will be slaughtered.
Putin is a big bully. He made war and now he’s making more demands, really!!!
How can you trust a terrorist state that bombs civilians and kills childrens?
Thanks a Lord🙏🙏
He is a terr0rist. Plain and simple!
Dont Trust Putin!
Put is a big Fat Liar....DON'T BELIEVE HIM.....He will not stop...He wants to hold the world hostage....He wants more power...He is lying 👌
Yes perfectly said, ukrain stop fighting back with boys, and those collected none country fight for you, make it rusia agaian and make comedy again.
As Putin put it, Imagine Russia going to Canada to build their military base and set their missiles there, how would USA react? Would they feel threathened and react, or would they throw a party for Canada? Does Russia has conflict with any other former USSR countries since 1991?
So basically this man is a terrorist. If his demands aren’t met he will continue. He said it himself. This needs to be treated like a terrorist. This man is fucked
Wasted my fucking time
Putin is not setting the table. Russia will stop when Putin runs out of cash. That already happening. He doesn't get to demand a dam thing besides an armistice to with draw the children soldiers he ordered to die. Otherwise it's going be a bitter spring for Putin and his people. Unfortunately for Russian people aswell. Maybe next time he will pay attention more than flirting with the airline young women or any flying skirt that passes him by.
I know one day Mr killer Putin... You never see the beautiful earth 🌎...  You killed more innocent people god is good.
What are the demands?
How do you pronounce Erdogan.....
Start a war and then say you won't quit until THEY stop fighting. Like that's gonna work.
How stupid.  His conditions are unconditional surrender.  Not going to happen.  Every Ukrainian will fight to the last man.
Literally repeated ID Ukraine stops fighting and demands are met 10 times
Don't buy it folks. So if Ukraine "stops fighting back" then they'll stop fighting....yeah try that the next time someone is tryin to kick your ass n let me know how that goes for ya.
Putin sets conditions to end Moscow's invasion in Ukraine. Putin sets conditions to end Moscow's invasion in Ukraine. Putin sets conditions to end Moscow's invasion in Ukraine. Putin sets conditions to end Moscow's invasion in Ukraine.  OMG Putin sets conditions to end Moscow's invasion in Ukraine!
Putin offered compromise talks before the fighting and is now offering a way to stop the fighting. Anyone with any sense and respect for the lives of all the fightes on both sides would give him what he wants for now and then continue the talks as should of been done in the first place.
Tf is this bullshit news
What are Moscow's demands at the moment?
OMG. GOD HEARD OUR PRAYING 🙏 🤲. THANK YOU PUTIN
At least tell us those Russian conditions maybe they are not that hard to meet
Bully terror-ist..
Of course what Putin wants!!!!
You forgot to report the most important part of your story. What are moscows demands?
Resistance is futile. Just join putin. Nato seems not to care.
The only condition that should be allowed to end this .The arrest of Putin and his henchmen to face war crimes in the Hague.  That Putin and his henchmen spend the rest of their lives in solitary confinement .
and those demands are  : 1) stop resisting 2) enjoy the occupation 3) admit   I was right... and 4)  promise not to be independent again.
We all know Ukraine won’t stop. Putin knows what he’s doing
What are the conditions? 🤦‍♂️
Are Moscow's demands clear?
STOP THIS CRIMINAL  WAR  =  NO WIN WIN SITUATION  !    THE WHOLE WORLD  SUFFERING  2 THIS  MADNESS   !     PLS LOVE THE EARTH   !
Romans 8:32 God delivered up his Son Jesus unto death, for all humanity. Hebrews 7:26 Jesus was holy, harmless undefiled and separate from sinners. If the World were like Jesus. Good character and works of going around and doing good - Acts 10:38. Especially dying for all. Helping others. Romans 8:29
It seems to  be a progressive step to deescalate by both stopping fight first and getting into dialogue later or simultaneously to reduce cas.
keeping this site in mind who oversells and under delivers....... never again.
Just end it
👍 Don't believe it.
The old man who failed to become KHALIFA again opened its mouth.
Erdogan zindabad
The man is a damn liar he is layin the groundwrk for he and china to control the entire eastern world he has d big guns so he doesnt care who he kills ao watevr lies an comforts he agrees to he is going 2 continue doin wat he wants knowin the world doesnt want a nuclear war so he wil b d schlyrd bully .when china sees his actions they wil follow suit who is 2 say they arent secretly supplyin him with goods to upkeep this war ?
Well Ukraine need to accept the conditions. Putin is in the right here and I think he is right.
I'm from South Korea I want to go fight the Ukraine struggle How can I join
Russia isn't in position to demand anything.
Putin will join and merge with USA Nato . Christans will going to joint together
No one can broke the rules of putin ge is the goat
You said NADA
did the russian plane leave dulles airport ?or is it a ongoing situation ? flight:    RSD88/RSD08
Ok, so it seems you forgot one little detail--WHAT ARE THE DEMANDS? Otherwise this video is useless.
Give me a hunter Biden's laptop and I will end the war in 5 minutes
I appreciate Erdoğan efforts to bring peace . The world need more leaders like Erdoğan.
A liar is not trustworthy.
Simple answer "NO"
Children being murdered rite before our eyes and the world doing nothing
The word is "No",don't do Ukane a favor just withdraw from Ukane  and remember not to come back..yours very truly Alfonso Cantu USMC
I think the reporter lost the rest of the text
What are Moscow’s demands?
The West should make it a condition for a ceasefire that Putin be handed over for a war crimes tribunal.
Yes!! Great job, thoughts,!! Im with President TRUMP on his words! V. Putin is too smart to go into killing sprees Ukraine people, Putin needs to stop now. Putin can say sorry. Show the world putin is a great leader of his country, love his people too. Ukraine people are hard workers too, like the rest of the world. No killing sprees! Its mental illnesses problems. Our leaders in the USA have mental illness problems for bringing voilence, criminal damages, destroying lives, hiring foreign felony criminals to do the dirty works for the Democrats. Joe Biden dont know sometimes.
2 minutes video for repeating single sentence. What are all the conditions?
That's like someone breaking into MY house, cut the power off and I defend myself against the intruders and my neighbor down the street tells me the intruder says they will leave my house and stop advancing towards where I am in the master bedroom, IF I stop shooting and meet THEIR demand. WTF, the nerve.
this is not news snd your video is old
compromise needed or it will be disastrous for both. Perhaps Ukraine could promise to remain neutral/not join Nato and recognise Crimea, Luhansk/Donetsk. In exchange Ukraine could join the EU and leave Russian sphere of influence (like Finland)
Yea.....give us Ukraine and we will stop destroying it.
What kind of reporting fails to mention what Russia's demands are?
I stand with Russia and Putin. Take back the Ukraine. No Russian has ever hung my ancestors, enslaved Africans, did hate crime using local police to lynch black people. Go Russia 🇷🇺 Go!!!
what a clickbait
Didn't Russia agree to a ceasefire before? And did they ceasefire? No...  They're not going to stop anything. And if they do, they're going to have their military ALWAYS at standby IN UKRAINE..where they shouldn't be in the first place.
we want palki upadhyay
He’s still gonna ignore the ceasefire and starts attacking everyone….sadly he only wants World War 3
Is russia going too pay for all the damage they've caused
🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺
So tell us Putin what's your demands..to continue to kill or to continue to invade Ukraine.. What a POS it's a shame one man has so much Power. He shouldn't be able to have any demands. For anything. I also feel sorry for the Russian people that's against this. They are gonna be poor before it's all said and done.. STOP THIS WAR.. pray For UKRAINE
What a joke
Russia just wants Ukrainians to laydown their weapons so that they can invade freely without a fight. Not gonna happen! Glory to Ukraine!
Innocent people are lossing their precious lives  Fight should be stopped immediately
WHAT ARE THOSE CONDITIONS? You've blathered along for 2 minutes straight repeating the same useless piece of information over and over again. Waste of time
We all know what these include...no Nato or EU membership , no foreign troops on its soil etc. Shldn't the agrersor be the 1st to stop the war else it ll prove to be a ruse
PUTIN IS JUST ONE WRONG LEADER,IMAGINE WHAT A SINGLE PERSON CAN DO HARM TO MANY😔😔
A dictator making demands of a smaller sovereign country to basically give up their autonomy and security for him to stop his massacres and savage destruction of the country is not someone who should be given his wishes. This will only empower authoritarianism and fascism and could create a domino effect in other places of the world. China and North Korea for starters.
moscow demand, do not push tiger to the wall, former warsaw pact has become nato, former soviet states has become nato, ukraine is the last red line frontier, zelensky touches the red line
shit pho    tyn,    r n p, pou teeen
Lol Russia is like the cop that breaks into your house and as you defend yourself, screams at you "stop resisting, stop resisting!!"
Moscow's demands will  met ,  but Ukraine 's only has one  demand too ,  Putin..  that you stop breathing first
Invasion seems cos of the 2 states separatist  help
DEMANDS, PLEASE!!!
We don’t want Peace. Now, you’re not allowed to leave. Nuke their Power Plants and see how much they like bombing. This is just getting good. No retreat now. American Citizen…..Vietnam Vet USN
Putin is likened to a child who throws tantrums when his needs are not met
it is very clear NATO and allies including USA are behind this war...they keep on inciting Ukraine to fight instead of encouraging a dialogue (when there was a signed peace negotiation, US president was out in the open inciting that Russia cant be trusted- and keep on sending arms to provoke Russia)...the question is WHY? That's because they already have in mind that they will LOOT all the assets the Russian government has outside Russian territories- including all the properties that an individual Russian businessman could have in their countries without even a single connection of their government's decision back home. That's insanely ridiculous while most of the people around the world are being deceived by this narrative of having Putin and Russia is the main culprit.  Biden and his allied leaders should be hanged for this!
I hope and I pray that he will end the war. In Jesus name
Too much blood in his hands already
pUTIN pESERASTY
LOL. If they stop fighting then it will be much easier for putin to capture kyiv. LOL even small baby knew this.
Ukraine should listen to big brother not the USA a stranger who will let them down  Russia will get  what they want an no one will stop them  The war should never happen but incompetent stubborn my country  I do I as I want back be the west
Russia: you stop hitting me Ukraine: no you stop hitting me Russia: no you stop hitting me Ukraine: no you stop hitting me Russia: no you stop hitting me Ukraine: no you stop hitting me Russia: no you stop hitting me Ukraine: no you stop hitting me  world: ....so who hit first?   Russia/Ukraine:  SHUT UP
"Stop fighting"?!! You mean, stop defending themselves?!! You attacked them, they are not fighting, they are defending themselves!!
And those demands are ???????????????????????????????????????
Efff Putin all the way to hell. I am sick of him. It’s possible to be part of the world and prosper. Without being a psycho asshole.
just give it to him
What are the demands @WION?
Never surrender Ukrainian people down with the tyrant.
Would have liked to know what Russians conditions are, please?
What are his demands?
I am quickly reaching a point where MY condition for peace is Putin's death.
Russia will nothing to prove they are powerful country...stop attacking Ukraine,free ukraine...
What is the difference between this Put-in offer and his Put-out from 2 weeks ago?  Nyet
In other words Russia will stop slaughtering civilians if Ukraine surrenders.
So...*what* are Russia's demands? That's the whole question. This is like saying "Putin's condition for ending the war is that his conditions for ending the war be met". Seems like a pointless, clickbait video.
Erdogan is a funny man.
Where is the most powerful nation now? I think they are planning to complain to putins mom
What are the rest of moscow's demands? They were never stated. And why should you Ukraine stop fighting first when they are the ones that started fighting last?
what is meant by ukraine stops fighting? absurd. should they raise white flags and get bombed by ruski airforce? even the pope is now angry on putin
Just the same  way  saddam  Hussain  talked to leaders who came to Baghdad  to request him for a peaceful  settlement  of Kuwait  issues  ,, same response
Why is she YelLing at us
They did nothing wrong to putin and should not give in to him  and that putin should go to jail he started the all thing it should be him
Don't trust this asshole...keep fighting at this point...wants to trick Ukraine people out of their army...keep up the strong fight
Vlad is peeing his pants. And he's finished.
How about the Russians drop their weapons & walk out, agree to pay reparations & hand over Putin  ?
This war is very easy to end. Just have Ukraine promise never to join NATO. That's it. Many lives would have been saved if they had done that before. These leaders and politicians are so dumb and low IQ. Dumber than dumb. Geez.
Who does Putin think he is . He is a very unstable dictator .
I think they are threatening Russia with a multiple country assault in Syria and in the Ukraine... And i think, Russia already expected that, before they started to chase the Nazis.....
WION has also learned the tricks of trade in media just catchy titles with no mention of demands.
How many dead from this invasion were covid deaths?
Impossible no one can bring peace ✌️
Путину так грустно, что ты принес разруху и нищету в Украину. пришло время положить конец этой войне и восстановить мир. Никто не может остановить вас, используя ваше ядерное оружие Никто не хочет причинять вред вашему народу. Окно для переговоров закрывается для России. Скоро мы убьем ваших людей, как вы убьете наших. Но твои дети умрут, твоя семья умрет, если ты не покончишь с этим сейчас.  We may not win the war but we will end it
Putin is not in a position to set the conditions. His conditions will be that Ukraine surrenders. He wants Ukraine to surrender because his campaign is failing. Ukraine will not surrender. Any conditions will be decided by Ukraine, NATO and the rest of the world, not Putin.
Don't believe a lying barsteward.
Doesn't matter what he says now, Putin is a dead man.
You probably should have put the conditions in the video instead of just repeating the video title over and over for two minutes.
Putain is like a spoiled child, being a pain in the ass if he doesn't get his way. Isn't there anybody out there that can put him out of his misery by uthenising him?
You said absolutely nothing new. Give up, stop sanctions and stop saying mean things about me. And keep buying my oil,
This is the beginning of the third world war
That is such stupid news... Do whatever I said then I don't need to fight.... duh.... that is surrending.
We support  Russia 🇷🇺 Ukraine people need  punishment and joker president of  Ukrainian🇺🇦 . NATO 🇪🇺it's just Trash nothing else . Russia rocks  🔥👍
Never happen
Any human being supporting a dictatorship that has nothing to offer to there people but poverty and a meaningless live has mental issues.. ITS 2022, NOT 1939.. Humanity should have evolved pass this mindless thinking
CLICK  BAIT  sadly and the conditions are ????
Nonsense news
putin stay strong please!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! you got this!!
Rubbish, an invading force setting conditions?  Hahahahaha, he is broken and unhinged ego!
@39 putin does fist pumps lol?
Communism.will not exist in the future in Russia
Putin is one big disastrous “faux pas” what’s worse he can see, knows it and can taste it. It’s called failure.
Sooooo… what the “conditions”?  Is it WION or Whine? What are Moscows demands? Seems reasonable.
one thing I know is that most people don't want the Wars, they don't want to Kill. So why are there Wars and killings? After all, if this majority of people decided and disobeyed what compels them to take part in wars, Peace would be made. So we should shout at the whole world - enough wars, enough lies and deceptions, we disobey these dark and evil forces. You can imprison me and even kill me for this cry, but in the multitude of these cries, Peace will prevail. So let's start shouting at every opportunity, in every broadcast, in every message.
Smoke show
Pathetic coverage. The war crimes are caught on multiple cameras. Death and destruction everywhere. Ukrainians not moving an inch. Orcs in BTR-21s getting killed in the thousands, but naaah, it's a military operation.  This isn't neutral news coverage , this is disgusting.
he's destroyed that country, why would they agree to anything now?
Indian journalist look fine, don't they ? And as TC says : "News reporting at its best. Reporter repeats herself in 4 different ways but hasn’t said a word." Gush I needed them to repeat four time, was great.
This channel becomes unacceptable day by day, shame on india. Unsubbed and glory to the heroes！
Hell…isn’t it him who started it all?  Nut case!
Moscow's 'conditions' don't matter anyway.  They lied about having plans to invade in the first place.  They disclosed these plans to the Chinese before the Olympics and conferred on timing.  While China kept their dirty little secret and sided with their demand of non-negotiable ultimatum.  What person could trust anything coming from Putin?????  Or China????  Hosting the Olympics while hiding secrets from innocents.   No one in the free world trusts anything either Xi or Putin might say anymore.  Putin and China are simply demonstrating to the world that they are willing to lie and deceive for the sake of mutually autocratic aims and maintenance of their own power at the expense of their peoples' lives.  Is this human progress by any measure??? The WTO will be finished as we know it.  The UN and NATO cannot tolerate obliteration of civilians unwilling to be cowed.  If Putin thinks we have already declared economic war and so is war, let capable freedom loving folks show him true, coordinated war on his forces and his regime within Russia.  Endgame.
I seen he almost gave em a first pump 🤣
Click bait there are No details!!!!
This news report is so scattered and lame.. Put on a reporter with more passion. This woman is just not it
Not gonna happen
Where are the conditions?
Putin's list of demands: 1) no NATO missle launching sites in Ukraine. 2) no NATO bio labs in Ukraine 3) no Maritime banking in Ukraine. 4) Arrest George Soros and every Nazi Rothschild. 5) Denounce the Queen and Pope.  6) Sign 1000 year peace treaty. Sounds reasonable to me.
No change then.
Devilputin
So what are the conditions? Report something worthwhile.
No chance they will lay down and surrender... Once Civilian Deaths occurred it's all out now.... Past the point of Reasonable Politics
Isaiah 47 come down sit in the dust Edomites.  Strong's Accord H5052 Acts 13:1 Song's of Solomon's 1:1-5&6. Amos 9:7. Edomites turning against each other tearing down Edomites Hegemony White Supremacy and the Lord the Holy of Israel do these things.  Those Edomites calling themselves white Christian Mulslims jews what a joke
France 🇫🇷 - " Why did U attack Iraq ?" USA 🇺🇸 - " We thought they had nuclear" France🇫🇷-"Why don't U attack Russia ?" USA 🇺🇸 - " Because they have nuclear"
By "stop fighting" Putin really meant for Ukraine to stop defending against Putin's attack and just let him takeover. Just to be clear...
What are the conditions?
Let me guess, it's the same things Putin has  been discussing for the last 22 years.. and no one in the EU was listening.
Russia will cease fire if all requested demands are met. No demand are listed. That was easy enough. When is the ceasefire?
Putin is right. Stop whit desinformation. Bravo rusia from macedonia. This is anerican eu uk trik
Russia Putin Will Never Take Ukraine Period People From Around The World is Joining Ukraine Russia Putin Will Run out of Troop's Definitely
US placing illegal restrictions via proxies, intentionally damaging an economy, placing innocent human lives into economic; health dangers; which can end in death.            Romans 6:23
I hope Zelensky holds out for Putin's unconditional surrender. Slava Ukrani!
That means Russia going to attack and opposite site not need to resist. 😅
an entire country must cost a lot of money to buy....so invasion it is?
Putin is the boss
Terrible video
So Putin is basically telling Ukraine to surrender and then threatens NATO he will use nukes if they interfere. Scary times we are in. Ukraine keep up the fight. I think this is just the beginning of Putins plans for taking over provinces and other countries as well. Pray for Ukraine🙏
and their demands are?
So if Ukraine surrenders Russia will stop fighting?  Ya ok  sounds about fair
I'm willing to bet the demands are unreasonable and not going to happen.
Never elect a comedian or movie actor for public service, government office or office of importance. They'll treat it for on screen heroism!! Zelenskyy had all chances to stop stop this war!
MASS MURDERER!!  массовый убийца! War Criminal!  военный преступник!
What a crazy reasoning....he attacks & say will stop if the besieged will stop fighting..
Answered prayer?
This channel has a lot of side news and late news,   Tell us something we do not already know !!!
This is genocide on civilians and warcrimes
Hey Putin haven't you ever heard of "TRAZODONE" ?
He wants half of Ukraine no way
And those demands are……………not going to be reported???
So…….no 😂
Pow
He is a lier he already said that few days ago
This war was declared by Nato to Russia. Zelenskii is an American puppet who was ordered to provide his country as a battlefield for this war. Zelenskii is making sure more Ukrainians and Russians are killed every hour that Nato and Eu can blame Russians to make an excuse for their pathetic sanctions. Now he wants us Europeans to sacrifice our lives for him??? Really???  Putin made his last warning to
"If Ukraine stops fighting," bro its their country. Pull YOUR troops out.
If putin literally wants ukraine as russian puppet he has to know that ukraine is a country that will not surrender
What are the demands tho?
What are the demands? 1.Ukraine must not join NATO. 2. 3. 4. Write the next demand
Don't stop fighting, he's sweating. What were gonna put it on the back burner so we can do it again in 50 years..?
WHAT are the conditions?     WHAT are Moscow's demands? WHAT   WAS   THE   POINT   OF   THIS   VIDEO   ???
Put him to jail
Who said nato having weapons near russia(aka ukraine) means russia will get attacked!?????.... This is classic vilain thinking, 🤣when a vilain knows deep down they had evil intentions and now mediators will be closer to him(stationed in Ukraine), to stop him, whenever he decides to do evil things to others!he will speak as such. (guilty conscience speaking here)... I dont understand the russian thinking at all!! Just bullies hiding behind an army!!... Well that army means nothing if the world decides to gang  up on anything Russian!!!
WTF are his demands? For almost two minutes you didn’t say a god damn thing
At this point who gives a crap what Putin has to say? If anything he's crying about his economy.
We Have To Support That And Respect What Putin Said. Please U.E And America Alliance Dont Make It Worst With Sending Weapon And Troops In Ukraine. They Almost Deal To Stop That War, Dont Make Everything Gonna Wrong.
🔴 _People of India stand with PEACE_  _WE WISH FOR IMMEDIATE CEASEFIRE..._  Vande Matram🇮🇳💙
This could be a trap.  Do you think you could trust Putin to end this fighting?
Well that's not gonna happen
This is to save face... Some person who's name rhymes with mutant, got slapped, and now he has to "Attack" in the opposite direction back to Russia.
PUTIN Naam sunke flower samjha hai kya fire 🔥 hai
Why can’t Russia think about the feelings of Ukraine citizens?
Russia condition is ukrainien should stop  the fighting and surrender so that Russia can install it's puppet leader in Ukrean.
Welldone  putin for stopping  the war  you made  me feel happier now thank you sir putin
The conditions are they will only stop of conditions are met.  Thanks WION!
Is this the cease fire conditions? Ukraine capitulates, Putin takes over. The Ukrainian President "retires" and Putin installs his goons. Southern sea access and the largest nuclear plants are retained for leverage. Ukraine autonomy is over.
Imagine waking up next to this horror.
This is considered news. I learned nothing.
Okay but what are the set conditions?
But what are Moscow's conditions.... For Ukrainians to surrender and be ruled by a Russian dictator??
so.. the victims are suppose to lay down weapons first. in their own home and still belive a dictator keeps his promises?
How should Ukraine stop fighting when they are the ones being attacked.
Meanwhile In Russia, children are detained at rallies again! What a great man
LIARS Evil liars
What conflict? He just invaded for no reason
WTF does putin mean by "ukraine stops fighting". So a criminal is trying to rape a lady, she is punching, kicking and trying to free herself, the police comes and he says his only condition for stopping the rape is when she stops resisting? Someone should please tell me i am stupid. FFS russia, the fight stops, if u call back ur soldiers and stop bombing ukraine.
I miss the demands / conditions. This information that he will stop on demands / conditions is not new, was already spoken about 6 days ago. What are those mysterious demands / conditions no one writes about?
Get out of Ukrainian territory now
If you are a POS like Putin, you always speak in half truths and lies so you can avoid having to explain your actions. He is a coward hiding behind his nuclear arsenal while he destroys a country that has done nothing to Russia.
What is the point of this bs? I expect to hear what Putins demands are.
So what are the conditions? This vid didnt say anything at all....
don't trust him. He's lied about everything else
FPUTIN!!!
I am not perfect, the way I explain things is not in any way intentional of hurting your feelings, offending you, or to make you feel less than. On the contrary it is to make you the best you. We will get the difficult questions in life out of the way so there is no question about what my motives are or what they are percieved to be.  Is there life after death? A question we all ask ourselves and the answer is simple yes indeed there is life after death. We have seen people die and other people "living" so to speak and we can all comprehend that after we inevitability die othe people around us will continue to live on. In that sense then life does continue after death, weather you participate in it is completely up to you.  Now then on to the really difficult stuff....the life we are all living. I am just a person from Cali. Funny fact. The Kali Yuga, in Hinduism, is the fourth and worst of the four yugas in a Yuga Cycle, preceded by Dvapara Yuga and followed by the next cycle's Krita Yuga. It is believed to be the present age, which is full of conflict and sin. What if I told you that science and spirit we're in a way very similar in meaning. It is ones way of interpretation of the world around them. Weather you want the big  Father Figure "God" to represent what you believe, or if you yourself believe that science, is the unrelenting force that drives us to an end goal. Either way we look at it we all strive to be happy content in our own ways of interpretation of this thing called life. Weather we interpret itas science, spirit, or money for that matter. How in the same breath can one say we had to kill so many people to preserve life? It is sad "first off that someone or some ones was so uncomfortable with themselves" they had to destroy something so beautiful to so many people. Where does the insanity end? When does the killing end? When will you have enough symbols in your life where you will be happy enough to say hears what these symbols are kids this is how you interpret them but never under any circumstances should you ever let them determine you! You must know that's all they are is just a way for us to interpret the world and how and what we do with them has a tremendous impact on the world the people the trees the air our whole environment.  We all as a people are smart enough to comprehend this. So I urge all of you to take a step back see what the game is that these governments are playing and ask yourself do you want to participate in these horrible and horrific tragedies that have plagued us for so long. We all want to live, we all want to be free we all deserve happiness.  All it takes is for you to find you and decide if you still want to play there game. Or if maybe just maybe we all can take a step back make new rules that are beneficial to life rather than destroying it. It starts with conversation and it ends with world peace.  We easily forget. I was never taught this, I never knew what school to go to that would teach such matters, of what in life truly matters and how do you change the world. As an infant we see the world for what it truly is as we get older we are taught what certain individuals perspective of the world around us "is" that we are experiencing.  We get tied up in nations, religions, language, and different peoples perspective of the world around them threw symbols and ideology. All "it" "is" is us interpreting these symbols, and trying to organize the chaos we see around us. We have confused ourselves threw language.  We have allowed language to define us, to control us, to control our actions in the world we are experiencing threw a means of symbols and the organization of these symbols. We are always trying to improve ourselves, improve the world around us, so what do we do? We destroy the world around us so we can improve the individuals world around them. Is symbols and ideas more important than human life? When will we all have enough symbols in our life where we are content enough with ourselves to finally break out of this loop of insanity that we ourselves have put ourselves threw? When will we all realize life is more than just symbols? An example of this confusion would be science.  Science is ones way of interpreting the world around them by means of other people in agreement of that interpretation.  Is religion and spirituality not another way of helping one interpret the symbols they feel? We all know in our hearts and in the depths of our souls this can not be real, yet this is our reality. We are living in yesterday cause we're to focused on tomorrow. Then when tomorrow comes you're on to the next day and so on and so forth.  We need to start living today otherwise you won't have a tomorrow. We need to start living for life, rather than dying to live. The unfortunate fact is we can only solve this problem threw language.  Threw conversation, interaction, and understanding that we are the ones who choose to play the game. So my question to you is what game do you really want to play? Do we all continue like we are? There once was a nation that made the great pyramid, I don't think they did it by just pure power. They did it with cooperation, and passion.  We could be that nation we could be that world! All it takes is better management, and everyone to be on the same page, stop pointing out the differences, stop judging people for the way they interpret this crazy world, and start judging yourself for why it has continued this way.
Basically .. let Putin win …  and he will them go back to Moscow and figure out how to do the same in Balkans (Serbia), Moldova and Finland (If it continues with application to join NATO). Of course, he really needs to put his thinking cap on to figure how to overrun The Baltics, since they have protection guarantees through NATO. That’s all .. just capitulate ..
My Indian government modi best govt in world 🙏🙏🙏
I strongly believe the Kremlin is high on drugs..  I am short of words to describe how deluded putin is. Russia is actually loosin the battle in Ukraine.
Putin has no right to set their unreasonable conditions
Putin will not stop until his demands are met, but what are his demands? this would be the same as i would urge another guy, give me one million or i will shoot you! Ukraine has no option, this authoritarian typ of state are a danger, one man can decide about war or not, this couldn't happen in India!
That’s not telling me anything
Putin I think knew clearly well Russia's economic, military capability and the geopolitics at play.🤔
I think they used the wrong phrase of words. Its not "stop fighting", its "stop resisting".
I will stop the the war wif you stop fighting back. It will a peaceful conquest. Lol that's not what the world wants. We simply qant you out of Ukraine and a apology would be good as well.
Russia's demands before it stops the war are: 1: The Russian economy must be in tatters 2: The Russian people should be amongst the poorest in the world 3: The Russian state should be a pariah 4: The Russian military should be seen as incompetent 5: The Russian people must curse Putin with every breath 6: The Russian oligarchs must see Putin as a threat to their livelihood 7: The Russian securocrats must see Putin as a threat to their power and freedom  Then, and only then, will Russia negotiate the end to the invasion.
The news from these people leaves a lot to be desired..
What are the conditions?
Two man Is the best, uraaaaaa uraaaaaa uraaaaaa
I hate war.... absolutely detest it.  It's a scourge to humanity.  But I sincerely hope Putin keeps it up.  He is about to get wwaaayyy more than he bargained for, and his actions are doing the world a favor because his ass is about to be erased from power.  He should be careful for what he wishes for because he's about to get it..... and I can't wait to see his face when he has the full realization of what's coming for him!
Who is listening to him?
ROSJA - IMPERIUM ZŁA, RZĄDZONA PRZEZ   MAFIĘ ZŁODZIEI I BRUTALNYCH  MORDERCÓW !!! PUTIN - PARANOIK , TCHÓRZLIWY SZCZUR KGB , KTÓRY TERAZ CHOWA SIĘ JAK MYSZ POD MIOTŁĄ W SCHRONIE!!
Since when does Erdogan have a say for Europe?
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
SlavaUkraini 🇺🇦💙💛🌍✌🏻
YOU LITERALLY SAID THE SAME THING FOR 2 MINUTES, CAN YOU ELABORATE PLEASE
Watching this clip is a waste of time.
The fighting stops after the last Russian soldier left Ukraine territory, not earlier!
Putin's  conditions    are  very fair   ' surrender  to Russia  and allow Russia  to take  your  country from  you  'Gosh  why  are they  fighting  back ?
Well Putin has his reasons for attacking ukrainre, it is not about territorial gains.
CLICKBAIT!!!!!
I left home without sandel..tell us wt type of demands instead making us fools ..bcz I promised my gf after I reading ur headlines..I said her wr about to end.... nw she z asking wt type ofdemands..hw to convince I dnt knw
Putin  has not seen anythin yet. My prayers to all the Ukraine people. no matter what Happend u all winners and Heros.
Putin, you have no demand shit to Ukrainian people
Continue the sanctions to this country. Banned them from doing business from other country. Penalized them for a long time so hoping they can learn and ask forgiveness for the crimes they’ve committed!
Putin, you order your military out of Ukraine and I guarantee the Ukrainians will stop fighting.
Putin started the war.  He is in no position to specify conditions to end the war.  If he doesn't get Russian soldiers out of Ukraine, then the Russian soldiers will die in Ukraine.
CLICKBAIT!!
He is totally lying! No reason to stop but still needs about 10 more countries!  He's gonna die Taking them!
I just can't believe the WHOLE rest of world is not helping more. A joke. What coz there not members of NATO we all just watch family's dying of bombardments. Should all get together and kick the Russians arses. And stop tip toe around the whole situation. Considering USA were quite late entering the last two world wars im surprised they not up front of the queue for ww3
something happened behind the scenes to this day...
yeah, like all negotiations end
Always a bunch of old men deciding the fate for everyone.
Sure we shall meet all the demands as soon as putin starts serving his life sentence for his war crimes he committed
Putin is now begging for justification
When Ukraine first stops fighting??!! Russia's army is literally INSIDE Ukraine.  A good way to stop the fighting would be for the Russian army to flipping LEAVE.
Putin know he is loosing this war.
who is he tonput conditions
With all the sanctions been put on Russia and all those that trade with Russia, why haven’t we put sanctions on Chinese trade? As The US,EUROPE,UK, trade with china and china trades with Russia, Russia is still getting financial gain via the back door via China?
is Demilitarization a fair demand? for me not. what do you guys think??
Just a little bit of common sense here. I know its rare but lets give it a go. There is a high probability that putin has a shitload of dirt on western countries and nato. So in order to not expose either side to crap they dont want in the public arena. Im pretty sure we will be back to covid kills in a few weeks.
The sadness is that the west forgets they're not the sovereign rulers of the planet yet they act like it. The extreme over reaction to Putin's actions is a direct hurt to all the other countries invaded and targeted without so much as a peep. People are noticing. Will all sanctions be lifted? US politicians are openly calling for Putin's assassination. How will all this be reversed? Why didn't all the pre invasion smarti pants negotiators predict this and sign the promise to not let Ukraine into NATO? To acknowledge and incorporate the two republics into the Ukrainian constitution? Imagine if China or even NATO decided that America's last election was fraudulent simply because there were protests and removed Biden and installed Trump? Does that sound right? No it doesn't and yet this is exactly what America did in 2014 in Ukraine.  This is such a hot mess and since Ukraine is "personal" to the current US president this is not going to end well for any of us little people. We will be trampled underfoot while giants fight and that includes Ukrainian and Russian and American and European peoples.... maybe while they are busy fighting others will start fighting taking advantage....then their little peoples will get trampled under Easter giants ... it's simply not good
Putin best
Mad tyrant sets stupendous demands
He a lier don't believe Putin
Putin is a criminal
Blow Russia off the face of the planet
Erdogan brokering peace is laughable
Putin says...Absolutely Nothing
Putin has lost the plot. He will stop if Ukraine stop shooting ? He is puttying demands for Ukraine to stop fighting, but Putin is the one who started it and is the aggressor. He has totally lost the plot.  Its like saying " I will stop knocking your door when you stop opening it. "  He lives in a world of his own, and that is a dangerous world.
What are Putin's demand or condition?
First, PUTIN has proven to LIE continuously and cannot be trusted in ANYTHING HE SAYS! This was shown even yesterday when they openly fired on the Ukrainians trying to get out using the so called "secure corridor"!  Anything LESS than a FULL RUSSIAN WITHDRAWL from Ukraine and and Putin letting the RUSSIAN PEOPLE SEE WHAT HE HAS DONE TO UKRAINE! The thousands of dead Russians and Ukrainians since this WAR started! The BOMBING OF SCHOOLS, HOSPITALS, residential APARTMENT BLOCKS! World CONDEMNATION OF RUSSIA will NOT END as long as ANY Russians are left in Ukraine!
Russians shoot at residential buildings with direct fire...why?
See hes start to realise that he's fucked him self
Fight till the end
He’s been saying the same demands, but it’s something Ukrainians can’t agree. Putin want them to surrender and agree not to join NATO.
So, Putin won’t use the word “surrender”. Why not?
Putin getting desperate
Biden imposes special economic conditions on Americans as well: taxes taxes taxes - Still isn't doing anything about the transients and criminals destroying our cities - Still hasn't fixed the EXPENSIVE healthcare mess Obama made - Still bought out by unions and companies, for example GM and FORD and doesn't credit Tesla AT ALL for actually doing all the work - And way to go on Afghanistan, everyone enjoyed watching people hanging from planes
Actually you said nothing....
Putin, u go to hell
How come that a crimical make a choice whats happening to the world
Huh! I thought  it was Russia  who started  it.💁🙅‍♀️
Will PUTIN rebuild the Country...?And resurrect the dead 😳...Nonsense
Russia should stop bombing firing not Ukraine because Russia first attack Ukraine
The soldiers instead need to overthrow Putin. It's only one man wtf y'all scared for?
You didn't even state the demands wtf
I blame America for all of this but Putin's demands are very unrealistic and closed off, for one Putin's troops are in Ukraine not the other way around. The cease fighting has to come from Putin and that means getting the feck out of Ukraine. These conditions means Putin intends to carry on.
US fk off ... fkig worst country ..we Indians never abundant Russia ...they helped indian in dark situation ❤️❤️ Always Russia ❤️❤️
Ever happen Ukraine most likely won’t comply to Putin’s demands.
Russia needs to get on their knees and make Biden and the Democrats happy. Then and only then will the magic weapons go to sleep.
Ukraine is not fighting but defending its self, so it is Putin to stop attacking and fighting Ukraine
In Putin's mind, fighting back is a declaration of war. Well, pretty much anything is an act of war according to him..
The sad part of it all is that Ukraine 🇺🇦 is a developed country not a third world country. Even more sad, people are just living their lives on YouTube, going to school, out to go to their jobs. etc and this is modern times that Putin decided to just destroy many lives.    Pray for all mankind.
But how can they stop fighting if he keeps invading? It's self defense at that point. What...does Putin just want them all to stand still and die quietly?? He's insane. Stay strong 🇺🇦
what a newscaster's english😅😅
Where is modi hiding ?
Russian unconditional surrender from Putin is acceptable.
Putin you have no right to call the shots! You are the instigator and agitator and YOU stop the war,
so if they surrender....If Ukraine surrenders, Russia will stop....that's not new, that's not even news.
You didn't say what the demands are!
Blocking this stupid channel, EVERYONE should boycott this stupid channel
Demands = Give me your country
Ukraine is Nato's toilet for fighting Russia. The war will never end unless military industry is stopped.
as always the mongols never pick side and wait till the end of war to choose
"if Ukraine stops fighting, we will stop fighting"..... coming from the same man who said that he wasn't going to invade Ukraine but invaded Ukraine anyway. Do you really think that Ukrainians can trust Putin and lay down their arms? I wouldn't.
Typical dumb reporting. Repeat yourself numerous times with out saying anything. In 2 minutes the only thing I learned is Putin will cease fire when Ukraine gives in to demands. What those demands are, who knows. I don't because this reporter just repeated the war will end when Ukraine surrenders. Do I need to repeat myself 2 more times? I think not.  Typical YouTube video, Catchy title, good thumbnail, $h!+ content.
I hope he includes the NAZI WEF breakup
Ok... What are Putin's demands?
Russia: - ''We will set up a military base in the Kaliningrad area because it is Russia.'' Europe: -''Sure, no problem''. Europe: - ''We will set up a military base in Ukraine because is it Europe''. Russia: -'' Sorry, it is not Ukraine, it is Russia.''
What are Putin's conditions? Obviously it's unconditional surrender. That won't ever happen. The Ukrainian people will never surrender to Russian tyranny.
Like any bully would say. Do what i say or else
Care to tell what are Moscow's demands?
Putin take your troops home
STOP UKRAINE BOMBMING , AND RUSSIA WILL STOP THEN TOO  !  N O W  !(!
Let us embrace peace ✌️
He realized he wanted to live because NATO was watching him like a hawk.
What about Syria
Stay strong Putin. Stay strong Russia. 💪 America and its dogs are barking and hit dogs will holler. But real men will defend theirs country and stay true to its culture and its people like Russia.
Never trust Putler bullshit
🕊️💙💛🕊️💖🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️
These sanctions works both ways now the fuel is sky high so we all feeling it
What are the conditions dam it tell us !
I dislike 👎 russia I like    👎 Ukraine
It is Ukraine which compelled Russia to commence war. It has genuine apprehensions
"If Ukraine will stop fighting?" Then stop attacking and invading.
Lmaoo, If Russia really in the position to make demands?
So what are the demands?  Surely they cannot be just that Ukraines stop fighting. That would be laughable.  Is the Russian demand that Ukraine cease to exist?
What are Moscow's demands? KEEP SOROS AND CLINTONS OUT OF THERE! SAVE THE CHILDREN !  WATCH THE TRAFFICKING ..  HAITI ALL OVER AGAIN
It will only stop when Ukraine surrenders
What are the demands? Why is she repeating herself like 20X? Why YT suggested me this useless WION thing?
Wicked man Putin. He knows how to twist the facts and blame someone else. It is obvious he is fearful of losing. He invaded and now he wants Ukraine to stop fighting. As Lindsey Graham said Putin must be taken out
Screw that Nazi, the world does not go by his conditions , he is a war criminal .
NATO encroachment since 1997  into Traditional Russian land's has to stop''' to allow Russia to exercise sovereignty and insure security. I wouldn't want any encroachment into my lands but it's happening anyway Viva la Biden, open border, Joe Why Joe why.
Puding putin .  scared out of his mind ,  losses are mounting his own people turning against hime . financial and economic breakdown.  hes failing on every front where russia is getting weaker more troops volunteers equipment , veterans .weapons are entering ukrain . to fight the invaders.  In impotent army lead by impotent leaders  .  in the mean time Nato and EU are building up large numbers of troops for exersizes in the baltic east and south  .    Some one that is winning a war doesnt talk about negotiating peace in a war he started.    some one who started a war and fails talks about peace as his plan has failed. and backfired
Tho I like the WION channel they have been slowly going down to shits creek
He did not expect the Ukraine people to fight like they are doing!! What about Ukraine conditions?
What about Ukraine's demands?
Typical manipulative tactics of evil “it’s not our fault it’s yours” victim reversal. He cannot be trusted he is a liar. He has been preparing for this for a long time.
Putin metaphorical condition to stop the war with Ukraine is clearly visible within 10 days of Ukraine invasion he is feeling the heat of international sanctions
What a worthless non informative video.
You said nothing here . Tell us what are the demands
Thanks for the click bait.  Good to know it's not only the US media who does this crap too.
Sometimes in history things are crystal clear - Hitler's rise to power was such a moment - In such a moment the dividing line between good and evil is clear - we can reflect later about what Nato could have done differently - Right now evil is being perpetrated on the Ukrainian people!
You repet same info again and again!
Before two days turkey hold Russian ships blocking it's way to Ukraine. Irony is now it speaking to Russia for talk negotiate. Every one know power of Russia. There is nothing wrong to worry about country safety. This US and NATI useless guys. I have lost respect towards them.
Modi should also go visit putin and talk to him
Russia is smart , the west needs to kind its own fucking business
MEET THE DEMAND
Useless reporting! Doesn't really tell us anything!
Putin stupid demand is for  Ukraine not fight back when Rusia  invade/ occupy Ukraine. Psycho president
Oh God WION, are you really this garbage now? Who sent you in this spiral? Why not state what the demands are?  This is why I unsubscribed from your channel. Click bate crap.
I have a "special condition" request.  Get rid of these idiot politicians and corporate entities that cause the wArs to begin with.  Greed and the thirst for power,  have to end.  It's ludicrous and pathetic.
Şimdi karanlik gri gördügumuz kiev sokaklari oysa ki cok kisa zaman önce rengarenkti... savas bir ulkenin renklerini nasil siliyor kendi eski videolarima bakarken onu fark ettim.. insan gittigi gördugu bir ülke olunca daha da fazla empati yapiyormus. Tum dunya icin baris ve huzur diliyorum🙏 savaşa hayir!
Putin's demanding ukraine to lose and give up without fighting, a war that ukraine has always avoided. That's why ukraine has always wanted to join nato, to get rid of moscow's claws...
Oooh Vlady, don't get Erdogan involved, it doesn't bode well to involve Turkey!
Greatest refugee crisis? You are lying. Check the history of wars of the last two decades.
Why do you set conditions to not commit aggression? Is that not the world turned upside down? Invade a free country and say you can end the war if you stop defending yourself.. That is what the man has to offer the world.
Mr Putin - you need your people to support you but with sanctions - they will have no choice but to ABANDON you !
What are the demands ?
One-sided demands.
So Ukraine must stop fighting ? Ok that's easy ! Stop invading ? Oh sorry Mr Putin what you actually mean is, Ukraine must stop defending themselves and hand over their sovereignty! Oh and Poland , Romania must also no longer be with NATO , Sweden not to be able to decide their own security ! You all need to be defenceless because we would never invade ! We don't have largest collection on nuclear weapons !  No no no ! How about fu£k off out of Ukraine!
Who will guarantee a peaceful pact with gangsters sitting in the SCOUNCIL.
Who are we kidding Putin will not stop
Are zhere sings zat I vant? Yeah's!   Verst) Za keys to NATO nukly-var veapons.  America: Thats a tall order, but that can be arranged..  Tah) Leaf ant don't coome bahk.  America: Again.. Leaving Europe is a tall order, but anyhing is possible.   Lest ting) Make Denald POTUS.  America: Yeah... Ukraine's f**ked
end
What happened to Putin's brain? Ukraine is only resisting because they want to defend their homeland.
What will Putin achieve? 40 million people in Ukraine who hate the Russian government and will never trust them again. Isolation from most of the rest of the world. Possible trial as a war criminal when, not if, he is eventually deposed. The contempt of the good Russian people when, not if, they find out what he has done. This despite all the Russian authorities' attempts to hide the truth from their own people. Heavy damage to the Russian economy. Thousands of Russia's sons killed or disabled. And all for what?
Hopefully this is enough evidence that Ukraine cannot be left alone on this. If we must risk war with Russia, so be it. but the West has to interfere. Putin is not deterred by weak actions !!!
What are moscow's demands? Besides Ukraine stop fighting.
Soooo, nothing changed. Well that's news worthy. Call me when Russia finally realizes it has lost the war ತ_ʖತ
Zelensky and his west want a US military base and Missile system against Moscow, and Putin want to protect his country from external threats of US and its Allies.. so if zelensky dropps his ambition then Putin will withdraw Russian army from Ukraine
she doesn't say what the conditions are, nice reporting
Putin is a psychopath. He thinks that anything done to him is 10x worse than anything he does. He is capable of the worst atrocities the world has EVER seen. He will stop at nothing to get what he wants. He has surrounded himself with "yes men" who will not stand up to him. The world has to stand in unison against this kind of insanity until the Russian people remove the threat to themselves and the rest of the world.
So, he's like a rapist telling his victim to stop resiting. What a monster.
Wtf you didn't say anything about the conditions. Dang this takes me back to my college days when I used to write reports. Oh hilarious
I'm going to bully till I get what I want!
ATTENTION: RUSSIAN SOLDIERS lay down your weapons NOW and defect to Ukraine. You get $50,000 and better treatment than in your own country.
So in other words there is no update😄 thanks
"Demands Are Met"  so they're puting an entire cpuntry on hostage?..
That's not a piece treaty.  There is no negotiation.  Just Putin demands.... Same as before...
How dare you???? How dare you?????? God bless Ukraine. God of love and no hate and lias and war!!!! GOD OF LOVE!!!!!!! 💙💛
Ukraine and Russia need to make an agreement!! No more war!!
I would like to know what conditions Moscow wants. Otherwise everyone I'm sure doesn't want war.
Translation of “Moscow Demands”:   Stay off our border United States, thank you and good night. 🤓
RUSSIA IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MURDER AND KILLING OF CHILDREN AND CITIZENS.
Ukraine as an independent country has the right to join whatever alliance they want to join. As a sovereign nation they chose NATO and the EU because they know its a doorway to freedom and prosperity while Russia is a losing proposition that will keep them impoverished and at the whims of Russia's dictator.
Uhh, and the conditions are?????
Should keep all sanctions on Russia until they return all their territory and go back to being a small country next to Scandinavia.
Wow, those are the same demands Hitler made when he invaded neighboring countries.  Putin is negotiating with a gun to the head of Ukraine muttering I will “Kill all, Burn all, Destroy all” if you don't meet my demands.
Not much info here....
Clickbait title! This channel doesn't know anymore about the conditions than other media...Disappointing
Am from Africa i stand with Rusia
The West should not allow Putin to take Ukraine, if the west allows this it will pay the price in the future, give Ukraine the weapons they need to push the Russians back,
Putins war is for hes power not for hes people😅
But you mentioned nothing about "what" those condtions are?
Peace agreement? Lol and how did that end up with Hitler ?
idi Haxyi putler
And what where his demands?
Eduan who? Its Erdogan
Putin, "I'll stop my dogs pooping on your lawn if you remove your cats from taunting my dogs" Putin, stop shitting on Ukraine, remove your dogs of war!
We’ll THIS was an epic waste of my time. I won’t be tuning in to this channel again. Zero information here.
What a waste of time. You said absolutely nothing gave. NO information.  Is this a joke
Military withdrawal means lost the war, plus sanctions already preceded. This war between US and Russia, Ukraine is just battlefield Putin knows what’s up. Most people are just brainwashed dumbs!
What are the 'conditions' that need to  be met, other than 'stopping fighting' .
Give  up Ukraine stop being silly
What an absolutely USELESS segment.
This man is needs to be jailed, he's a danger for the world.
OK !Putin is going to stall, but he is going to use it to attack some more! Stalling is a distraction!
Thank you for wasting our time. Delete your channell
Hell no! There will be a Ukrainian reparations fee on all future Russian  exports. Russia must exit all territory including Crimea and Donbas. Russia must send reconstruction materials. Russia must move their military forces 500 miles away. Ukraine will join NATO and the EU. Etc.
Well they'll stop fighting once Putin's thugs get the hell out
Stupid report! What are the conditions?
Enough for "BLOODY MERE POTENT".
My question is who is going to clean all that mess. Do they have a cleaning crew?
Wion is trash reporting
Putin waste lanjakoduku
Was putin gonna give him a fist bump?
This is very low quality news.. utter nonsense…
Lmao his demand will be the same as the beginning...😂😂😂😂 puttin is not leaving ukraine no time soon....we have months of war
Conditions should be.  All Russian troops must leave.  Ukrainians can go home if they still have one.  All special sanctions removed. Then Ukraine joins Nato so this will never happen again.  Peace ✌ Putin must resign so the Russian people can elect who they want.
This guy is going to kill millions if he's not stopped.
UURRAA UUURRRAAA UUUUURRRRRAAAAAA
clickbait!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
WION is usually good, but everyone please dislike this video. It's a clickbait.
People should use logic some time poison is better than false hope
Ukraine is not fighting, Russia is fighting, Ukraine are defending, and they won't stop defending themselves or meet any Russian demands.  Ukraine is a Sovereign Country and what has been done by Putin is illegal. He has to pull his troops out and then arrested for war crimes that he has committed.
LMAO....Putin is making demands now! Doesn't Putin realize he's a walking dead man. Not as smart as he thinks he is or Trump's uneducated dumbazz gives him credit for. Dead man don't get to make requests or demands! Putin is like a little kid playing with a large hornets nest! You pissed them hornets off, now you going to feel the consequences! You making threats to the rest of the world....not the greatest idea seeing how your army doesnt really want to fight and cant beat unarmed & untrained civilians. Putin will go down in history as what not to do!
This is old video of Russian and Turkish president this is lying post I will only watch CNN NEVER WATCH wion
Insha Allah may the war end soon so the world can be a peaceful place again .. !!!
So the condition is surrender?
What utter shite this is. WHAT ARE THE CONDITIONS??
Europe can't last without energy and food from Russia. So all this is empty threat.
I hope Russia WINS!!! PLEASE eradicate the nazis ONCE and FOR ALL!!!
Sadly, whatever the demands are, USA and NATO will never agree and can't wait for Russia to press on the war. Ukraine is just another tool used to bring down Russia. It's just necessary collateral damage to deal with Russia and drive the multi billion war industry.
If they get a speck of mustard on their suit they send it to be dry cleaned. Meanwhile the clothes of innocent people end up drenched with blood.
A. Do not negotiate with Terrorists B. When Terrorists demands are met, they tend to not honor them C. Putin already "promised" a cease fire, yet still bombed areas where civilians were evacuating which means his word is worthless. D. Do not negotiate with Terrorists, and Ukrainians are strong as heck, don't discount them.
Zelensky wise up. You can't win
And the demands are....????
Put in goal!
I pray that god takes this evil monster very soon. Amen 🙏
Stop fighting lol? He's trolling
Making CCP China Nazis poor again= Stop funding Russia, Taliban, ISIS, and North Korea.
Well Russia is asking for these demands to resolved now because they weren't for past 8 years. On other side, Zelensky is screaming for help from NATO and U.S and they already gave up. His "cry" for western support just means that Putin was right about the conflict. Unfortunately, the sad reality is that this was always possible to happen when you are messing around with one of the top military forces.
Only responsible for us and Ukrainian president
You dont know what the conditions are?
OKAY let me translate this in the language of common sense. Stranger punches you in the face and while your laying on the ground they're taking your wallet. The store employee walks out and demands that you two work this matter out peacefully. Get it now?
DON’T STOP FIGHTING!!!
Hes a liar, and should be 5 feet under ground. Hes the new Hitler, but this time with A-weapons
The title implies there’s an invasion in Moscow???
For 1:52....Moscow demand are met....Duh! What is the demand?...
Mr Putin... Please tell the world how are you going to BUILD BACK THE BUILDING'S HOMES OFFICES AND BUISNESS THAT YOU DESTROYED...HOW ARE UKRAINIAN PEOPLE GOING TO GO ABOUT THEIR LIVES( which defenitly will never be the same) WHAT ARE THEY GOING TO EAT HOW ARE THEY GOING TO EARN...??🤷 WHAT A MESS ALL THE POLITICS AND POLITICIANS HAVE MADE...!!! Common people just wanted to go about their lives and b happy...And here comes your Ambitions with TANKS AND GUNS...ITS HIGH TIME ALL POLITICIANS SHOULD REALIZE THAT "HUMANS ARE MORTALS" AFTER ALL....SO PLEASE GIVE LIFE A CHANCE WHILE WE'RE STILL BREATHING...!!👍🇮🇳🙏
it is high time ukraine come forward and honor the promises made to Russia.
Lol 😂 only if Moscow demands are met 🤡🤡🤡that's not going happen
Did Putin ask Erdogan about the Turkish drones that the ukranians currently have and been successfull at scouting russian positions. Theres more on the way by the way
The Warsaw Pact has been dead and buried long time ago. Why NATO think it is necessary to expand aggressively encircling Russia with its war machines? This war was created by NATO at the expense of Ukraine to undermine Russia.
psychobutt already told us what we wanted. also threatened to blow up the world. Putie's going to be taken away in a straight jacket and tried as a war criminal.
Puttin’s way of waving a white flag. He knows the longer the war is dragged on, the worst will only be brought to him and his gang. But let’s not be mistaken. This should be a wake up call for the world as long as Putin is in power.
Basically, Putin's demands is still the same with just 1 added condition (not to attack Russian forces). WION, I actually quite like you guys due to your coverage of the CPP interests in SE Asia, but this is just blatant clickbait at this point. Stop it, have some respect. This is actual war where people are dying, and you guys are here trying to clickbait people who are concerned about this disastrous event.
Watching
Mr Putin _ you are so OUT of DATE - ! We don’t do WAR with bullets Nor nurclear but we do war with sanctions or computers  ! Learn more - Mr Putin !! Stop the WAR in Ukraine ! You literally killing your countrymen in Russia which is happening now !!!! You have nothing to gain!!!!
What demand? It's simple, NATO must stop encroaching the Russian Federation border and Ukraine must be neutral in this supper powers game.
I dont trust putin 😤
His word and the ruble are worth the same right now..
Putin’s Conditions: Ukraine surrenders and becomes Russia’s.  Isn’t that the who point of the war anyway? Stupid clickbait.
Didn't Ukraine said that will negotiate only without any conditions?
Pls mr president of Ukraine u had tried ur effort now  give up, our commonwealth mother Britain is a small nation to assist Ukraine, Russia is greater than the lion's 🙏🤲🤲🤲.
Russian signatures doesn't mean craps why sign anything again it will be just like when they to give up nuclear and then what
He needs to chill out, hump a pigeon, and quit being a seagull humper.
Putin is a nutjob.
make a vid about the news yet u fail to said what his conditions were i found it a pointless update
This war is as big of a scandal than Covid!!! The MSM has once again forced us to only be able to accept one side of the narrative which I have learned that when social media bans you from having an open debate and if you are not following protocol then you will be silenced. It’s ridiculous, I already see billboards in my little country ass town in the state of Georgia “We Stand With Ukraine” wtf!! Why do you stand with Ukraine? What TF do we know of Ukraine? All we know is that MSM is telling us this is what we are to believe and if you don’t then you are some domestic terrorist and don’t belong in this country.
Russia only wants power over all. Putin is pure evil. His cronies are also evil. Its about power and control. Look at his own country you can see his teariny on Russia peaple. He will not stop this war. What country is next on his hit list.
stupid news... useless...
Russia is not sanctioned , it’s just an exercise…😂
It might have helped the report a little if you'd summarized WHAT THE BLOODY DEMANDS WERE!
Lousy Journalism... gives more questions than answers
Putin conditions for the fighting to stop are the ukrainians lay down their arms and russias conditions are met. You mean he wants them to surrender, right? Very nice of putin to put niceties around it
Should be do conditions at all!! Depends on conditions!!
This si the worst clip ever. What are the demands? You are supposed to tell the WHOLE story. This is clickbait.
Putin controls only his own brain washed people like Hitler led his people to Armageddon. Putin gets no tow tow from outside of his sad little delusional madness
clickbait bs
No conditions mentioned.
This is crazy Putin is having another tantrum again during all this .... Russia should cease fire and go home and the war will stop not d orher way around.... can we get the truth behind all this cause it just doesn't make sense
No deal with terrorists, please. They need to pay for the mess that they created for the rest of one generation with good behaviour
We wont surrender putin you monster
Why don’t you tell us the conditions?? This is click bait. What’s the Russian demands??
Wion getting suuck now
what hard hitting reportage - we now know nothing - brilliant
Blah blah blah.. WHAT where those conditions is what I hoped to learn. Waste of time
He needs access to the Med and Turkey can prevent that. Putin’s Black Sea fleet is bottled up.
What are the demands..
What is India doing to help Ukrainian?
Sign an agreement like Budapest Memorandum which Russia broke and was able to attack Ukraine? No way ! Welcome to the meat grinder that you made Mr Putin !
So after the Russians destroy all of Ukraine then they will get wat they want as well,WTF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
As if ANY news outlet will actually be reporting truths here lmao
The only thing that needs to be discussed is Russia's surrender and how and when Putin and any of his followers will be executed.
Yeah right! And I am Christopher Columbus.
Useless video what are the demands
Putin, if you are still stupid, please continue to fight.. The suffering and killing is only for your own Russia people and Ukrainian people as your brotherhood, not for NATO and USA.. NATO and USA are laughing at you due to so far they are wining without fight and without losing of a single soldier on battlefield.. Be smart! Stop the war please.. War brings only suffering, don’t follow an evil minds..
Uraaa....Russia
Erdogan does  not  have the morals to tell Putin  what to do. Has he forgotten  that he went into  Syria and still is? None of these leaders  have any shame keep dictating  morals to everyone else. SOBS 🤣🤣🤣
Putin is afraid of Erdogan👏👏👏
Who is putin to make demands to any1, u miscalculated this invasion bug time, ur so called military force is pathetic and weak. 🇬🇧🇺🇦🇬🇧
His conditions should be... dig a hole and he jumps in... never see surface again.
So how many refugees as taken by cowards USA
Powerfull man - Vladimir putin All Europe vs Russia 💪
Putin holdings all the cards
This video literally told us nothing. FAIL. On to different news source.
ZZZZZZ,  ZIVEO V.V.PUTIN I RUSIJA MILION GODINA
We have to confront evil now.  Please Please Please China, Russia and Islam are the enemies of humanity. چین، روسیه و اسلام دشمنان بشریت هستند.
1 Thessalonians 5:1-28 (KJV)  But of the times and the seasons, brethren, ye have no need that I write unto you. For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night. For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape. But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief. Ye are all the children of light, and the children of the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness. Therefore let us not sleep, as do others; but let us watch and be sober. For they that sleep sleep in the night; and they that be drunken are drunken in the night. But let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and for an helmet, the hope of salvation. For God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ, Who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with him. Wherefore comfort yourselves together, and edify one another, even as also ye do. And we beseech you, brethren, to know them which labour among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you; And to esteem them very highly in love for their work's sake. And be at peace among yourselves. Now we exhort you, brethren, warn them that are unruly, comfort the feebleminded, support the weak, be patient toward all men. See that none render evil for evil unto any man; but ever follow that which is good, both among yourselves, and to all men. Rejoice evermore. Pray without ceasing. In every thing give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you. Quench not the Spirit. Despise not prophesyings. Prove all things; hold fast that which is good. Abstain from all appearance of evil. And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. Faithful is he that calleth you, who also will do it. Brethren, pray for us. Greet all the brethren with an holy kiss. I charge you by the Lord that this epistle be read unto all the holy brethren. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen.
No matter the invasion of Ukraine will be ending up or  not, the world will never trust this russia  Hitler anymore.
I think Putin is starting to realize he's going to be dead and south of heaven before the next year.🙂😈
Joe Biden foreign policy is DISASTROUS
is any Ukrainian went to Russian soil to fight against Putin??? you idiot Russian stepped to Ukrainian soil and how could Putin urge Ukraine to stop fighting???? shit you should withdraw your troops then fighting will totally ended
Ok, and what are his demands? Stupid news clip.
Whoever started the war first, he must stop first🤫
WTF is this click-bait?!?! Pls give specifics next time.
Hope it will run,..
Still the Russia shelling ukraine
But I thought Russia was NOT invading Ukraine......This war  blew up on his face.  POS dictator. Rise and take your country back Russians !! Join the free world !
Why the background music playing with the news read ? The war will stop but not the news sensation.
Ukraine invasion is brutal mob style of Putin. Putin is known for killing anyone who he suspected to go against him. Be it his own close officers, journalists, opposition politicians, civilians, he’d ‘remove’ them all. He rules with fears and intimidation tactics.
What are Putin's demands??? What kind of news station are you if you don't tell us what the demands are!!!
Putin is full of crap 💩
A war because of west's foolish actions, tho I still don't support destroying public properties and unarmed citizens
Erdoğan is just as nuts as him.. I'm so glad I live in England 🇬🇧 an we don't have crazy dictators.. YET. 😶
Ukraine must act in accordance with Russian demands. Nothing going to change if Ukraine doesn't join NATO.
War is an influence stronger than words and meaner than talk, With a Dash of' you leave  us no other way to solve the Problem.
So basically he's not negotiating. It's just give me your country and I'll stop killing Ukrainians. Spoken like a true dictator.
What are the demands? This video is a broken record. It has the editing quality of a first grade essay. "I have terms. I like terms. My terms need to be met. There are terms that need to be met. The terms are needed for the war to end. Terms are good" Should we look for a part two to this video that actually conveys some information?
Uh oh, now we see cracks in the invasion. Putin is trying to find a way to withdraw & save face. Good luck with that.
Stop fighting? So that they can invade Ukraine freely without any casualties?
what demands if your going to broadcast  say what they are  ?????
that fist bump lol
Putin is full of crap 💩
What demand ?
Thanks to russia, destroy the nazis!
He best be arrested
Putin isn't in any position to set any demands. He is getting his ass handed to him at the moment. 🤣
Putin is holding the world hostage . . . blackmail of the most egregious kind.  I still say snipers are the best bet to end this - make him afraid to ever show his face in public again.
Stop Fighting invader? Putin are nut, Putin want Ukraine to surrender after destroying the infrastructure?
There is only one way to stop a mad dog like Putin
What are the  Moscow demands?
Nothing he says is worthwhile. The Ukrainian people must fight until the Russians retreat and the threat is annilhilated
Putin is a murderer. He can't be believed.
11 millon sovjet soldiers was sacrifice thier life to bring peace and prosperity to Europa.   They deserv respect.
Whats happened to covid-19 last month I was still being told how many where dieing per day now not a word never mind Brexit, BLM,Climate change (remember last weeks killer storms)   now its WW3. Cant wait for next week.
Me: (to Ukraine) Stop fighting NOW.
There was zNo news in that, just repeated crap
This dude is a narcissist
Putin: I'll stop the war if you let me win. Zelenski: Go @#$% yourself.
He's in no position to set conditions, he's desperate...  He acts like these sanctions will end once he signs a peace treaty or something, WRONG.  The U.S. will never lift sanctions and U.S. sanctions alone will destroy the Russian economy, no matter what other countries do...if you are cut off from the New York financial district you are dead in the water economically.
wtf is this shit you didnt even say what the conditions are lmao
The Agressor now wants to win without fighting..dream on tyrant Putin,,,so much blood on your hands
Sorry, but, this war between Russia and Ukraine, is non of the worlds business.  This is how 2 world wars started, when we interfere and choose sides.  I remain neutral, for the sake of my family and country.  The world is so very devided at the moment, and if any country makes a stupid decision, get involved, the whole world will be pulled in.   The world will be better off by harboring the Ukrainians that dont want to be part of Russia, we have enough space for these good people.   Seems to me this new "woke" generation never saw war first hand, and if they experienced it, they would pray it never happened.  When your children asks for food, and you dont have, your loved ones die around you or suffer, you will understand.  Stop being idiots
Putin go to hell!!!
How can you “ sanction “ someone that is supplying you?????
WHAT A SHITTY VIDEO CLIP.  This is exactly what I thought what WION was not.  Dont make me unsubscribe.
That doesn't make sense..  Putin already invaded Ukraine and wants Ukraine to give up, in order for Russia to end the invasion that Putin started?!  Basically meaning give up, so we can take over Ukraine without resistance.
Putin wasn't expecting so much resistance. We the world love u Ukraine 🇺🇦 ❤ 🇬🇧
I can tell you that neither one is backing down. So those demands are worthless!
usa only can make war movies , nato yellow ,   (  Great ukraine )
Nato goes away. You are creating this endless war. USA, EU also a part of covid 19 research and they poisoned the whole world.
You doing good job baby
Putin is a liar and by association is implicit in   mass murder  he cannot be trusted at all, I think that he thought he could once  again March into Ukraine and take the Country and that the rest of the World would just moan a bit for a while and in time everything would die down. But not this time, in my opinion if Putin is offering concessions the sanctions are working  big time and he needs a way out.
Asia countries suffered lot by USA&European criminal operations … many such displacements happened far worst human violations happened. Afghan suffering for basic food needs….
Russia’s demands (holds Ukraine down on playground): “Quit hitting yourself. Quit hitting yourself. Quit hitting yourself.”
Moscow's demands? Putin doesn't understand we've had it with him. There will be no agreement to Moscow's demands. Either he retreats unconditionally or we'll stomp him in to the ground so deep it will take a thousand years to dig him out.
Vladolf Putler will fail
How these politicians can smile at a meeting while people are dying as they speak will forever puzzle me.
So basically if the West had listened at the beginning it would have prevented this situation totally. So hopefully Putin will get his security concerns addressed and peace secured. The Western leftist are are joke. Well done President Putin 👏 I hope our evil corrupt governments finally listen..I doubt it though.
And everyone is supposed to believe that the Russians will abide by any agreement. And we can all imagine what the conditions would be. Please tell us what those ridiculous conditions are.
What are the demands?
But don't trust Russia do anything in future. Time war answer to Russia. World don't trust Russia.
Thanks for not elaborating on Moscow's demands lol, not sure what repeating yourself 5x does.
It's scary how one man has so much power.
How to recognise a Fascist state :  a system of government characterized by rigid one-party dictatorship, forcible suppression of opposition, private economic enterprise under centralized governmental control, belligerent nationalism, racism, and militarism, etc. How to recognise a Communist state : see above.
What demands?
Well what are the conditions and the demands?
1st major and important condition is very well known. No NATO, EU membership for Ukraine should remain neutral the rest of the conditions i don't know
WTF IS MOSCOW DEMANDS. WHAT KIND OF FUCKING NEWS IS THAT. WHAT ARE PUTINS DEMANDS???
Very poor journalism. What exactly are the demands?
Maybe that would be possible if Russian troops stop fighting and retreated to there borders.
Turkey<3
"I'll stop punching you in the face as soon as you put your hands down and let me knock you out."
Wow India has the ìnformation out fast! Wonder why u have Russian news faster!?? Did you vote at the UN???
Thank you lord for the stop the war. Thanks russian and Ukrainian, peace and love for every our nations.
We will stop invading ukraine if you give ukraine to us
You have blood in your hands
OMG.HITLER  STOP WAR !!!
Since Putin has lied about everything since before the invasion , if the Ukrainians stop fighting, the Russians will continue the assault and take over the Ukraine without opposition.
I think Putin is starting to realize he's going to be dead and south of heaven before the next year.🙂😈
India needs to stop selling Weapons please.
Does he really believe that he is in a position to be able to lay out conditions for an end to his hostilities? Wow, what a complete idiot he is turning out to be!
Putin has lied again and again like Hitler he will not stop
Yes! His demands ! His demands won't be compromise! He will want Poland and Romania defensles ! Wouldn't want any resistance when rebuilding old Soviet!
This war is about economy and it's being fought between the US and Russia. The EU states are just vasalls for the Biden administration. Ukraine is just a stand in for the US, which are themselves in an economic war with China. The US need to shut off Europe from the Russian Energy supplies to sell their expensive fracking gas - they are standing with their backs against the wall economically. They are throwing Europe against Russia as a last chance to remain in power.
So what are the conditions? What are the demands???
You have failed to advise what these “conditions” are? Ukraine stops fighting would require the Russians to stop attacking a foreign nation?
Putting demands rejected. Further humiliation of the Russian state is his lunch.
ვინმემ მიაკალით ეს ძაღლი პუტინი.  ბავშვების მკვლელი ავადმყოფი, ძაღლიშვილი ნაბიჭვარი
Putin a piece of UKraine. He is the aggressor but wants his demands to be met. There is no war in Russia because Ukraine does not invade any part of Russia , he is getting nuts. Put some more sanctions or else fight him.
Army of the Damned. 1942-1943 were tough years for Russia.Many of there frontier army’s especially the Ukraine . There Army’s were destroyed captured. 600,000 were turned against Stalin. Even a Hero,who had earlier saved Moscow. Russian equipment..German uniforms. Never trusted..they were given suicidal positions on the battlefield.Cannon Fodder. Hitler Hated them and Stalin never forgave them. After the war..many were sent to prison or gulags. That General was executed. 600,000 soldiers many from the Ukraine. It’s one of the reasons Vlad refers to them as Nazi’s. Very few of the....Army of the Damned....ever made it home.  Walter Kronkite did a complete story.1961 I think.have it on dvd. The Czar had long subjected the peasants then..Stalins purges(pre war estimated at 10,000,000.)killing many in troublesome areas especially Ukraine...then Hitler..killing a few million more....then Stalin again..as Ukraine and much of Eastern Europe was stripped and sent to Moscow. Now.....Putin.
That pres Zelinski surrendefs this might be the demand...She did not mention any..
Well don't let putin the gangster get away with his crime.
Conditions . I think conditions are over. You've gone too far and you know it
So Russia's conditions are that everyone listen to their demands, and their demands are that everyone listen to their conditions?
Someone needs to make Putin disappear.
Half of the world were instigating against Russia, Putin waited so long for negotiations….. now he can wait again…. And wait and wait…..
Demand probably would include that ukraine president  resign and leave the country, that ukraine stop application for nato, that ukraine stop bringing matters to social media and other countries, that ukraine soldiers stop fighting against russian soldiers for they see them as threat, and that helensky stop campaigning against russian president because he provoke this to happen... Just my opinion... No to war... Have mercy on innocent people... The people below suffer the most between the battle of 2 leaders... Hope they compromise and settle things to stop this bulshit war🙏🙏🙏🙏
Russia mad dog is barking...shut up right?
"Stops fighting and conditions met?" Its not a funny situation but that made me truly laugh out loud. Of COURSE he would stop fighting for that! "I'll stop the war... if you let me win." What a putz.
So Russia wants something really they want to take over uk,,so who are the other country's think they are to determine what  good for Ukraine they don't have no say in what is best for UK,,,its not up to France or Germany or anyone else to decide what UK should do when they are hiding up a table in there safe zone no fighting back to hell with them
🟦🟨 SLAVA UKRAJINI 🟦🟨
What is the demands? They did not even say
Please just end this madness, agree terms and change them again when the Tyrant dies!
Russia already approved they don't keep that word....
Yeah after destroying ukraine
Putin: **Instigates the violence** Also Putin: "We will stop fighting if you do." Me: 🙄
Nato fault. Putin was correct
The demands are that Ukraine becomes part of Russia. Basically Russia is saying to give up fighting and you're part of us now. Surrender.
Shame on Wion, and shame on India. Wion calls the war "Op" for operation. Disgusting.
mos-cow says MOO, dont demand anything from anyone
"if Ukraine stops fighting back..." This 5'5 stump is incredibly ridiculous!!!! You know what that means? It means when we take over your country we'll stop. Smh ridiculous little creep
don't trust putin very dangerous this person
Nice clickbait
This is click bait  ZERO NEW INFORMATION
When they have stopped the Russians then Ukraine should invade Russia..the world is with them to arm them to provide men ..
ukraine is not fighting they are defending stop attacking they will stop defending pls. pls what more do russia want they destroyed most of ukraine already
Lay down and Putin's BS....NO WAY !!!
I think Putin is starting to realize he's going to be dead and south of heaven before the next year.🙂😈
How many times one can repeat the same statement? What are the demands?
Ukraine, stop fighting? they defending their rights to be free from a Dictator!
Alot of you have no clue what's really going on here it's way deeper than what we see In the surface they keep us in lies thru their history so we won't understand the actual ideals of it
I'm starting to lose interest in this news channel
Bet those conditions will have advantage to moscow undermining Ukrainians interest
Long live ❤Russia🇷🇺🥂🇮🇳India ❤
The demands include a ban on Ukraine entering Nato and a limit to the deployment of troops and weapons to Nato’s eastern flank, in effect returning Nato forces to where they were stationed in 1997, before an eastward expansion.
1 Peter 1:13, Therefore, with minds that are alert and fully sober,set your hope on the grace to be brought to you when Jesus Christ is revealed at His coming.✝️
What are the conditions ?
Erdogan speaking of illegal invasion? xD xD xD how ironic is that? lolol
Is Putin fighting with his Peacekeepers?
do not set any condistions bcoz you are the aggressor you destroyed the lives of Ukrainian peoples
Putin's condition: Russia will stop attacking if Ukraine will stop fighting.  What? Hahaha
the problem is he will look as weak if he just surrenders. so these are the tactics to slowly de-escalate a lost war.. he knows he lost this war and is only bringing russia down from here on but can't just back out either or else he loses all his power
This is good if Russia and Ukraine can agree
3 DEMANDS from Russia  1. Russia wants USA stop making Ukraine NATO member.  2. Russia wants Ukraine an independent state.  3. Russia wants Ukraine stop killing orthodox Russian minority in Ukraine. If these demands met Russia will stop war
Is this a joke? Also, you could do better with the background music... spend a little money, it a war after all
We are all for señor Vladimir Putin and his strong stance for resolve the crises. If only the stubborn Volodymyr Zelenskyy would hurry up and sign the damn peace-treaty with señor Putin and Zelenskyy can save a lot more bloodshed & destruction.
Long live Turkey, long live Erdogan.
Russian special operation has been successful..  Russias banks, oligarks, common people and even mr Putin himself git rid of excess assets,money and yachts. Russian military gets rid of  overaged tanks,logistics,aircrafts and young recruits  Russia is getting rid of young educated too radical  people and foreign investments which are fleeing away as fast can.  I Thought Putin was a maniac when he started this special operation but it has been a success ever seen since A.Hitler.  MrPutin is a genius                  Even Donald Trump agrees!  Waiting next week to happen. 🤩 No credit cards, no windows pcs, no I phones, no androids...
What are Moscow’s demands? She said it twice but she never went into detail about e demands.
Pro Putin autocracy coverage completely misses click-bait subjec thinks its slick.
I dont get it he started the war and he demands condition?
Moscow demand.. Demilitarised Ukraine.. Not to join Nato and for the president to stand down (and be sentenced to death) and be under his Dictatorship.. And for Ukraine to become a puppet like Belarus.. He basically says.. I want your fosil fuels and I want your water.. And makes up lies about nazi regimes and genocide in the Donbas region and Nato putting nuclear warheads in Ukraine to justify his tyranny.. He's a liar.. A vile lunatic.
we came to kill your brothers fathers husbands sons who are military forces of ukrain, so lay down your weapons and let us do with you what we want. good peaceful plan. he is delirious
Zalensky has tried his best he should always souls to eat, sometimes saying apology does not mean you are guilty but rather to admire peace
This is not going to end well soon. Especially Ukraine is full time backed by US. Biggest looser here is Ukranian and Russian population and Europe. Unlike US Europe heavily rely on Russian Oil, Grain and rare mineral exports and a trading partner.  Due to it's massive size as a country Russia holds a great leverage. Even though NATO and US crippled Russian Economy and we can see the effect is already put in place with time Europe will also feel the pressure (Already crude oil is at record high). So it' would be better for everyone to solve this out somehow. Right now it's in a dead lock status. Russia is no way in a position to take control of Ukraine now. They only had the surprise blitzkrieg attack to gain the momentum. They failed miserably especially due to fierce resistance from Ukraine and low morale of their own solders. But now they don'e have a chance. But still they can attack and damage because of their supreme air power. So I believe even Russia is looking for a way to get out of this.
What are the demands ??? What a frustrating way to report thiz
And if Putin gets what he wants. Who's to say he'll just stop there. And that china won't be long either to escalate a war of their own
putin is trying to deceive people as if he is winning the war.the fact is he is losing bigtime in ukraine.and even his armies are dying and some refused to fight because they were deceived  by their generals that they are just doing exercises.what they didnt know is that they are going to die without even seeing the enemies.
GODBLESS RUSSIA n UKRAINE May Peace ✌️ Bless All ur HEART ♥️ With LOVE n STOP 🛑 WAR.
Putin waited for this actually... He knew they will come to his terms!!
God bless all thank you lord
Putin..New world leader?
America is a collaborator ever since!
I'll stop invading your country, if you let me invade your country.
yet another sensationalist clip
It is like. "Drop ur weapons i will leave you alone". The same they said "give back our nuclear weapons i will recognize ur independence". Now Ukraine is alone and unarmed.
I think it's the other way around...Ukraine will stop killing Russian troops if and only if Little putin stands trial in in the World Court at The Hague Amsterdam.
Remind us of the demands.
We people of the world demand you Russia to stop. You are killing innocent people.  You have no right to kill any living things here on earth ..
Putin wants a surrender and he wins easy
Stop this war pls 🙏🙏🙏🙏💔💔💔💔
Clickbait. No mention of what those demands are. I’m sure they don’t really want us to know the true value of Ukrainian lives.
The absolutely only way for the Ukraine to come out of this aggressive act of genocide and unprovoked war, is to continue to fight tooth and nail. Demoralize and destroy every single Russian invader who sets into their country uninvited. Putin has already lost this war, now he just needs to realize it, and leave with whatever dignity he can muster. If Ptuin is lucky, maybe he can negotiate his release of power in Russia, and find a country that will allow him to live outside days on the outside of a prison cell
Basically, surrender or die.
The president of Ukrainian is only 2 years in power  He changes Ukrainian people lives provocation Putin
Love Russia
Surrender or die. Simple condition.
On bended knee is no way to be free.
Same as they did with India with recent miltery billion dollars deal! So now india is pro kremlin with its pro kremlin disinformation shills activated!
Pretty stupid clip without explaining any details of the demands they want to be met
So........What are Moscow's demands? By the way, Ukraine should NEVER EVER stop fighting. Those Russians, all the world knows now, surely, after all these years of doing the same thing, with the same methods, that they absolutely cannot be trusted one bit.
Refugee crisis is the most terrible crisis for mankind  even seperating children and families beyond boundaries , Russia must agree for ceasefire without any condition and bargaining on humanitarion grounds.
What a grabage news fix the title stop using click bait title.
We had more than that come in to the usa since joe took office.
Weird terms.  Ukraine wouldn't be fighting Russia if they hadn't invaded?   Even if every Ukraine stopped fighting would Russia leave Ukraine?
what are the conditions????????????????.....click bait!
What are his demands ? You mention them multiple times then don’t say what they r ?
Butcher Erdogan is getting a lot of good press.......
Oh really the worst refugee exodus. Really!!.🙄
Another lie by Putin, the prince of lies.
This is garbage. Literally mentioned none of the demands
Putin,we will defend our country and we don't give up!It's no conditions!Get out of our country,stop killing our children!You ve already lost this war because no you or your government not welcome in our free country.This is the end of you and your country ,Putin!We will not surrender!Welcome to hell!
Give thanks to Klaus schwab and George soros for this conflict soros is the instigator provoking this conflict just because he wants to eliminate putins federation
Russia is committing genocide on the people of Ukraine and we in the free world will never forgive or forget, Russia will die a slow painful death. The world will never trust this snake again. All power to Ukraine and defeat of Russia.
What were the conditions?
I have little sympathy for racists Ukraine, so I'll let white people fight white people fights
I have little sympathy for racists Ukraine, so I'll let white people fight white people fights
its obvious that India is sympathetic to Russia
Nothing has changed after the talks. The sentiment will be the same it seems in tomorrow’s talks. Only Christ can deliver, if they want to meet Christ conditions. 2 Chronicles 20 KJV.
What are the demands?
What are Mascows demand ?
Aleph: The life you have known since you were born was used only to raise you into yourselves. This is a temporary phase, and was used to set the foundation for the new world. This phase will end at a specific moment.   Beth: This is to give you an understanding about the end of this phase. It is the introduction of the many things which were hidden from you as you grew into yourself.  Gimel: To understand the "end," you must understand what happened in the previous world. Indeed, we are approaching the end of this phase, but you need to understand what it is. We will be transitioning into a new world setting, but you need to understand why you couldn't be born directly into it.   Daleth: The growth process, is the life you have known since birth. Your growth into yourself needed to be completed through an alternate timeline, and the end of this timeline is the new beginning. For many reasons, you could not be born directly into it.  He: It was discovered in the previous world that the growth process needed to be completed through a separate phase. That is the life you have just grown into. The world you are about to transition into, could not be seen, or known yet. For many reasons, it needed to be saved for last.  Vau: The next world setting is the same as the previous world setting. Everyone will be activated into their original bodies, just like in the previous world, but this time, you will see the new world differently than how you saw it before. In the previous world, the knowledge of the Creator was freely available to all, and life was practically worry-free. The system was set up for everyones' comfort and enjoyment, but the nature of the human mind was not well known yet.   Zain: It didn't take long for the downfall to begin. It was because of how the human mind naturally operates as it grows. The previous world became a major disappointment, and it was declared a failure, much like this current timeline. This current timeline is being used, only to grow everyone into themselves, then the new world will be introduced.  Cheth: It is completely natural for people to grow into their own understanding of life, and form their own beliefs. People would still form multiple religions, even if they knew "God" this entire time. People would develop their own "theories," even if the answers were right in front of them.   Teth: The knowledge of "God" became meaningless to everyone, because that is all they ever knew. Many people were even convinced that they themselves were actually wiser than "God." It was because everyone was born and raised knowing "God."  Jod: The end, is the introduction of the new world, which is also the previous world. You just couldn't be raised directly into it. The new world condition could not be introduced at your beginning. The family trees were set to grow into temporary bodies, until the designated time for transition. This has been a sort of alternate reality, and it was used only for the growth process of the family trees.  Caph: As everyone grew directly into the previous world, nothing was hidden from them. They were basically raised into a world setting that would put them on the course to becoming "Gods" themselves. It was a great idea at first, but as the world progressed, people lost touch with reality. People became self-absorbed, and their own human nature took them down the wrong path. It was impossible to change peoples' perception, and not even "God" could set them on the right path.   Lamed: People chose to follow others, as they strayed further from the Creator. People formed their own groups, and began defaming, spreading lies, and fabricating falsehoods about others. They even considered "God" as being "evil."   Mem: For many reasons, "God" was hidden from everyone during the growth process. The natural human mind needed to grow separately from "God." This was the only way to eventually change peoples' perception of the world they grew into.   Nun: The "end" is the introduction of "God" to the world, and the reactivation of the family trees, both alive and dead. That is when everyone enters the previous world once again, but this time, with an entirely different perception than the first time.   Samech: The only way to unite everyone into one understanding, was to conceal certain things during the growth process. Then at the time of the end, everyone will be shown what was missing. The people of the world will share a common interest in what will occur.   Ein: The reactivation of the family trees will occur at the end of this growth period, and those who are alive at the time will also be reactivated. The body you now operate is temporary, and is not your original body. Your original body is also a physical body, and the transition of those who are both alive and dead will occur at the same moment. You will be reactivated back into your original body.  Pe: The concept of everyone being reactivated into a separate, physical body may seem inconceivable, but nothing is more "magical" than your existence. Your ability to even read, and comprehend these words, is far more "magical" than anything else that could happen.  Tzaddi: If you were born and raised into a "wizard," you would most likely not see yourself as "magical." If you were born and raised into someone that could fly, you would most likely not see yourself as magical, because it would be all you ever knew. Right now, you are a magical creation, and are naturally blind to it. It is a completely natural occurrence, but it must be overcome.   Koph: The ability to see, is far more magical than anything that can be seen. The ability to hear, is far more magical than anything that can be heard. The ability to know, is far more magical than anything that can be known.  When something amazes you, just know that your ability to be amazed is far more magical than anything that can amaze you.  Resh: The next world is basically a continuation of this current world. This current phase was used strictly for the growth of the family trees, so that no one could grow adapted to the new world. It needed to remain hidden until the end.  Schin: The new world will not be perfect. It will be a great deal at first, but people will slowly become adapted to it. The new world is not the solution. The solution comes from within us. The introduction of the new world will be the beginning of a new perception. Everyone will have a common interest.  Tau: You were created to live forever, but your growth process needed to be completed  separate from the new world. The new world condition is quite special, and it must be fully appreciated. If the people of the world were raised directly into it, it would not be appreciated. It would not be valued like it should. It would have the same results as this current world. The new world could not be introduced until the end.
And the Demands are ???  Nice CLICK BAIT and lack of reporting from WION as usual...
President should listen and put down guns….stop listening to USA and UK and the other western countries….they using Ukraine’s as pawns on a political chess board…it’s clear Putin wants you to put down arms and stop listening to USA and that’s how this war escalated by USA and the bigger countries saying fight for your country and stand against Russia and you go and ask your civilians to fight. Then the western parts undermine Putin and media has headlines like “oh Putin mis calculated and Ukraine standing strong” and what happened after that? All hell broke loose on the Ukrainian countries….if you do not see it now then you blind Mr Zelensky….but the western countries is not going to help….they want this
Putin is lying
Don't believe Putin 🙏💙💛
What are moscows demands?
no need Putin your military is so weak hahaha
I am not finding any other news sources indicating Putin has provided conditions and a green to stop the war if they are met. DO NOT TRUST THIS VIDEO until confirmed as truth by other sources   They also didn’t list what the conditions are…. Also suspect.
No, we want more dead Russian soldiers.
But we already know this
This is the only option he has. He destroyed an independent nation and the reputation of the one of the world best forces. It was clear they shoot even without having any aim. What to acquire and what to not? I'm afraid Ukraine will never agreed on anything he imposes to destroy the sovereignty of their country.  War is a hell. It's only know those who had experience the situation of a war. Its not like a film you watch. Shamelessly the only option this dictator left is to cease this. He should have fined for the damage he has done. Feeling really proud of the Ukraine people and they are really an asset for their nation. For the freedom of Ukraine...!!!
Wtf are the demands?  This was a waste of time.
Putin : All i want is peace ✌️☮️  *A piece of Ukraine* 🗿🗿🗿
right

Putin is a big big big joker. Don’t be surprise when the whole earth is put into the spirit. The world will pay the price I promised. You all be enslaved in the  new world. Guarantee 💯 Yahweh
So wtf are the conditions? -.-“ great journalism
You stop 🛑 it , you started it first !!!!
What are the demands?
So Russia will stop killing if Ukraine surrenders - thats not really news is it?
Hmmm...judging by what has happened so far, we should actually believe the opposite of what he is saying. He can't even tell the truth about a humanitarian corridor. He gets people's hopes up to get away, then says just joking and starts bombing again before anyone can leave.   He plans on flattening Ukraine then move to Moldova, then probably Finland while the world watches people killed and countries burn.
What is Moscow’s demands. I watched the entire video to know that. 🤦🏼‍♂️
रूस ही जीतेगा।
Its pathetic that you don't report the specifics of his 'conditions of ceasefire', specifics which are obviously not something that leaves Ukraine with any real sovereignty or democracy.   One sided Indian reporting is shameful at the moment. Its almost as if your trying to paint the picture Putin is trying to end this when he is not! He is only interested in his objective of destruction until he gets his little way.
I STAND WITH RUSSIA IN THE FIGHT AGAINST NAZISM!!! ✊✊✊
Listen, please, install the Bible on your phones, so you know what our creator and Jesus Christ can do for each of you. pray even without leaving the place where you are. Pray, pray.
What are Moscow's demands
Keep these sanctions in place until Putin is put on trial for war crimes: clearly these sanctions are working.
What kind of news hopless. Repeating same again and again. What's Putin's demand??
Clickbait……. Garbage channel
When you have friend like EU and NATO, it is better to reach agreement with Enemy like Russia.
Ceasefire is BS and not respected. Putin demands had been rejected. After destructions and killing of civilians also committing war crimes. So?
The way Putin is operating it's like Russia is in heaven where no one will reach what he is doing to others he must be dealt the same way this is too much
All demands from moscow is non starter. 🤦
Conditions null nonsense
Why can't we see Putin himself talk? We would like to hear the demands from him.
The raw suffering of people around the world including our Ukraine family is unacceptable and all corrupt leaders who bring this to peaceful families will burn in the bowels of the deepest eternal fire. Everyone is suffering ESPECIALLY UKRAINE. My heart is with you all good families ❤ 🇺🇲🦅🐍🇺🇦 Never bow to tyrants. Stay armed.
Therefore finally Sleep forever all life but not dead! Shanti! Nirvana! So, keep hope alive only! Hahahaha!
false news
Well this is a useless story.What are Russia’s demands?
So first they attack and then he says end this conflict they should stop defending themselves? huh? lmao
This guy is out of control Eukrania is defending from them, They are fighting them. WTF
Hahaha  I have to shake your hand mr. Putin where are you  Come to settlement or no my bayrak dron is ready to attach your armed whicle  And have your S400 to target your su57 or mig35  It’s good from ordogan   A honest person
OK the news is ..Putin announces condition and the condition is to meet the condition..  What are the conditions?.. talk about empty wording here
Erdogan disses putins fistbump. I think turkey's next
But Joe Biden will be so disappointed if the war in Ukraine ends. He can't call himself a war president anymore.
What is Moscow demanding? It’s not clear
PUTIN. Petycions. ARE imposible. To be acept.  These are imposans. Not. Petycions.  Just cant make no de el. Whith. PUTIN.
Is this site slow??  What're the Demands?!   Why mislead us and NOT mention what the demands are?! I'll never click a WION YT again because they seem to drag you on a 2 min rant without an explanation.   GREAT REPORTING (_____________)Enter sarcasm there.
What are the Moscow's demands?
Russian economy is fucked up and so the Putin , he knows his next job is a Garbage man !
the world and humans + animals are ALL better off without putin  edit typo
NATO, the U.S., and the U.N. have not fired one shot in defense of Ukraine.   These groups have meetings, votes, condemnations, and appeasement to offer.  Their excuse is that Ukraine is not part of NATO so it's ok for Russia to roll in and kill everybody.  Sweden and Finland are not part of NATO either and now they are being threatened by Russia.  Is letting Russia have its way the template for all non-NATO nations going forward?
Middle finger salute to those who support the dictator Putin.
Stop call it "special military operation"! This is unjustified barbaric, agressive war against democratic country.
Europe has to deal on its own and not to join hands with US.... throw out US meddling and nosing in all parts of the world...
Terrible uninformative report 🤷‍♂️
I think we all knew it would stop when the demands were met, which you said none of them.🙄
The west, particularly( CIA) wanted to drag Ukraine and Russia to an insurgency Gorilla war that could last for years! That is their plan. They have been directing a secret US training program in southern bases of united states for Nazi Ukrainian special forces and other intelligence officers since 2015. Now they are sending militants disguised with different identities.  US government has a well-documented history of backing extremist groups as part of foreign policy adventures because Guerrilla warfare is essentially a political war.The West are filthy disgusting human being and have no value for human life but just interests.
Putin is not to be trusted.....he needs to remember that he started the abusive attack ...
Putin needs to go. To Hell......
What you mean un - arm ?   Hey guy no one trust you. Who are you ?
many media failed to mentioned the it is the Azov(=neo Nazi) and CIA pushing for this chaos. They're directly involved in the Ukraine politic. "Not just Azov. Right Sector, C14, and all the other splinter Nazi groups.  They are running the whole Ukrainian show, under direct instruction from the CIA." The USA installed Nazis and a lot Ukrainians didn't like that. They are the ones who called to Russia for help to stop the murder and Azov secret police terrorizing them. They are resisting the tyranny installed over them
Putin cannot win. Looks like the penny has dropped before his economy is wrecked.
Ukraine should be demilitarized immediately to stop the war. All Eastern European countries and European countries are racist countries! Those poor Africans stuck for weeks while Ukrainians can go anywhere!
I’m glad the war is ending, but I feel sorry for all those innocent people from both sides that died for nothing because this negotiation could be done before war…
these are the times when you wish Death Note is real.. it’s amazing he is like a serial killer, but people can’t do anything to him..
There was no information in this video. What, for instance, are Moscow’s demands?   It had always been the case that if Ukraine surrendered, Russia would stop fighting…. So what has changed?
It's sad to me people in the world fear his Nuke threats enough to let him destroy a entire country and murder its citizens! Same on people!
Putin the coward hiding in his hole the only reason he wants Ukraine is to get wealthier than he already is ,how did he become so wealthy? His ship is worth 100 million dollars his homes are worth fortunes he dictates and keeps everything for himself . This is evil at work.
Ok, but want are the conditions? Poor reporting.
Mantap pak putin hajar terus nato kami mendukung bapak
What is the demand???
Ukraine should want back Crimea from Russian control. Putin's backed into a corner with his troops not wanting to kill Ukraines that could be family members. Javilen and stingers are much cheaper than a fighter jet or tank. Or maybe his wife or kids begged Putin to stop. Or is it Putin's lies again. Although xtrump has Putin beat at lying.
Moscow's terms are not practical, these terms are insulting
Turkey is another occupier
What demands. Terrible reporting.
This means nothing
So what are the conditions ?
This madness ; called war should be stopped for goodness sake
Putin is a killer and he needs to pay for all the damages of homes and lives that were lost to Russia invasion of Ukraine.
Sounds reasonable. Zelenskyy? Do i!
Its like pootin demanding that ukraine to shut up and bend over... lol 🤣
bring the black hair back
PUTIN IS A GENOCIDE. HE MUST BE  OUT OF INDEPENDENCE  COUNTRY  WITHOUT A  CONDITION.  HE INVADED  UKRAINE 🇺🇦.
And the demands are? Felt like a waste of time listening.
What are demands?
Get Bidens creeps out of Ukraine!  Child trafficking, biological labs, and war.  Biden seems to be used of Satan.
Putin demand is soviet union
America should say I got conditions also stop or I'll bomb the fcknoutbof Moscow for every bomb dropped on Ukraine Russia must feel the same civilians or not only cause Putin is their god
Didn't puton say he wouldn't invade ukraine?? His army shelled and killed children. He has no care for humanity. True psychopath
They're being beaten by the Ukrainians. Who are they to set conditions? They are the aggressor.
Its this, Puitin have put Erdogan in a difficult position, that goes for Modi too. And that becuse Putin invaded Ukrain. There is a thing that opne can do bussines with Russia as long they dont make war. After that every country have to pick side.  In the long therme, sooner or later there gonna be a military conflict betwen Russia and NATO.
russia ok
What are the conditions??? Why not say it. Could it be that the conditions are reasonable and the media doesn’t want us to know.
Nah, time to cripple Russia until they depose this madman. No time to appease him - it didn’t work with Hitel or Stalin and it won’t work with him.
Wow....excellent eye opener
Hell to Putin! Ukrainian President: We don't negotiate with terrorists
When Ukraine stops fighting? Putin does realize that they're invading a country right they cant stop tell they do Ukraine defending not invading. I don't know why I'm trying to make sense of it I mean they attacked a nuclear power station which is in neighboring country which means they are endanger themselves wtf. lord knows my country and many others put there nose into other nation's affairs and I believe main cause of why this happened. but this statement comes off like a man forcing himself on a woman and saying let it happen what poor choice of words.
So he’s basically accomplished nothing. Hasn’t changed Putin’s mind but Turkish state run media is implying a breakthrough. BAH!
Peace under Trump...only one Potus did this
Why USA should not be santioned for what it did to Afghanistan, Iraq
The conditions don't end the invasion it literally does the opposite
THE CRIMINAL DEMANDING CONDITIONS TO THE JUDGE??????. Psycopath.
Well?…..🤷‍♂️ what are the conditions?
putin  you cannot beat a country and tell the people them not to cry ...there cry is been heard by  nato and other country coming to there aid
I'll save you some time. This video is crap doesn't give you any info
This channel is usually good, but there is no story here.  I would hate to see this channel go for the money grab and posting useless content.
NATO was formed to counter the communist Soviet Union, in 1990 the Soviet Union fell but NATO didnt disband and has been trying to nibble away at Russian territories ever since, NATO pushed Putin into a corner with its policies and for months putin warned it would retaliate. So this invasion is the result on an irrelevant NATOs failure and even they admitted it. Now the cronies of cancel culture and gender politics have jumped on the chance to discredit and demonize Putin with everything they got. Its real sad when you think of it.
Too late to be making demands...
Putin, to hell with what so ever you think or feel, I pray God help Ukraine to win this war so you will be put to shame
...however, since Moscow's demands are outright idiotic and leave no room fo realistic benefits to Ukraine, the war will continue.
stupid news channel, where are they based on?
Imagine being putins soldier and getting a badge saying you're a special military operation veteran 🤮🤮🤮
He signed one of those in 1994, we see how that one went.
Don't you just love news reports that say NOTHING.
This was the most useless urgent news.
The war is over. Go home
The head of Russia's central bank wore  black last week the death of Russia's economy is done when you have only five countries in the entire world voted that the war on Ukraine is valid.really.Putin stated that the sanctions could be an act of war I say it is a Special economical mission.🇨🇦🇬🇧🇬🇳🇮🇹🇯🇵🇲🇫🇺🇸🇧🇻🇪🇺🇩🇪🇭🇲
His words are worth less than his currency.
And .... the demands .... are........
Love Russia from India 🇮🇳..hope for peace in both Ukraine and Russia
He doesn't like how the war is going - even though it's going according to plan (yeah right) - so now he cries...
Russia have the power now no questions!!!
This guy is just insane : drop you weapons and we will not shoot on you ….what a deal …hopefully
God she has the most annoying accent ever
The only thing I see when I see Putin is an old man who has realized he only has a few years left on top so if he wants to do something big its now or never.
You cannot trust a word this man says..
But he is always lying. So why listen to him
I love how the video keeps repeating "The war will only end if Ukraine stops fighting and Russia's demands are met." even though THEY NEVER SAID IN THE VIDEO WHAT THE DEMANDS WERE
Karel van Wolferen Dat is de waarheid hij heb 50 jaar oorlog verslaggever Zo boeiend
We don't trust Turkey
Then stop and sit and talk see what nato will do after
What are Putin's demands???
Mission focused is putin
Don't believe this demon. Putin will never tell the truth. All lies.
Putin himself invaded and setting conditions that Ukraine stops fighting! Funny!  He must return back unconditionally!
Biden knows what he wants and he will get it. If Zelenskyy cared about his country and people he'd strike a deal with Putin now.
Putin is done for...he's been played nicely...he flexed his muscles and the world called his bluff...he started a war he wasn't ready for...so he ended up in a positon he can't get out of...unless he goes out of Ukraine very soon,  he is reaching the point of no return very fast...his main headache it won't be NATO, but the social unrest simmering nicely in Russia...this is why he kept his best troops around Moscow...
And what are Moscow's demands?
War started due to NATO... Putin was warning again and again not to cross red line...and now when zelensky crossed red line ...putin started war ....still nobody came to help ukraine. Zelensky called NATO US AND EUROPE...nobody came to help...general public is suffering losses ...NATO is beating around the bush
Stay strong Ukraine
It's too late Putin!!!
We will halt invasion if Ukraine stops fighting and accepts to be annexed. 🤡
Shame on you, you asked demand this shit you started...
Would have been helpful to say what those demands are.
Russia needs to get out now and cut your loses. If you stay it will only get worse for russia.
putin is showing signs of weakness-he knows his end is near-also remember he is a communist which means he would sell his own mother to get ahead and then lie about it
would turkey just surrender if putin invaded or would they fight? i think turkey would fight back. his conditions are suicide
Putin trying to give fist 👊 but got shut down! 🤣
War is stupid. Nobody wins in both sides. In the end it brings destruction, pain, misery, and death to all people.
So basically: "We can have peace, if you do what I say"
cantry loving prasidant putin good job
Clearly Russia wants to stop Ukraine from being part of NATO and to stop being a hub for US, UK, NATO money laundering, bio labs, but mostly to stop the NWO ideology take over of all countries with their “Great Reset” and “Agenda 2030” world dominance where the select few from the World Economic Forum and Davos group, and world dominance of banking cartels (they are all one in the same). Control humanity right down to how many people should be left alive, because according to them there’s too many useless feeders draining the natural resources and breathing thus creating global warming (CO2) thus climate crisis. Is Putin any better,? not. Evil against evil for world dominance, while China sits by waiting for that dominance after everybody obliterates themselves. And as always the innocent people are caught in the middle losing everything over the power struggle. It’s a good thing that God has this ultimately. Praying for the innocent ones in Ukraine. I’m hoping that pres Zelensky realizes it didn’t pay to be NATOs puppet, because they left him and his people to be slaughtered.
Cmon Putin, stop this stupid war, you get no glory Ukraine Even you ppl shoudl stop, both of you join and bring peace
before the war broke up.   putin said he will not attack ukraine.
This guy will not stop here. More wars to come.
Moscow's demands can never be met. No sovereign nation can
Click bait...gee ... Putin says cease fire if conditions are met......DUH...would be worthy if said conditions were reported.....DUH
Putin killing it's own people - as he said they are one.  EVIL -
Putin want fist👊 bump Erdoğan like homie 😅😅
absolutely just sick: just decided not to force my people on death missions. WHAT A PRICK  \drone that POS
Criminals don't set/make conditions. You must be indicted, charged and go behind bars.
This is the maddest worst thought out war I've seen , this is going to be Russia's vietnam at best add to that the sanctions so vietnam with a depression at home
Yeah so total and complete surrender or be murdered. Anyone can be touched why can't we get Putin ?
So...he is suggesting Ukraine to surround...his condition is Putin's way condition. What about Ukraine?
War is not solution
Economic Sanctions wont hurt Putin. It will only make Russia rally behind him. Think of a child that is abused by their parent. If you hurt their parent they will rush to their defence.  The west is only strengthening the support for Putins presidency. Putin is protecting its borders and the response from the west is to punish its civilians. They will see the West as the enemy not Putin.
Moscows demands are to surrender the country to Russia and become the Republic of Ukraine. See Republic of Georgia for more understanding.
Russia said opps we are running out of bombs and missile we need to make more for the moment we cant survive if nato invade us
Oh, he will stop if everyone surrenders, myuh.
The media should cover more in-dept. There is no details given, have more transparency.
Sooooo sick of click bait.
While his people die, while Ukrainian people die, he travels around the world is his private jet, bulletproof limo, million dollar security guards & for what? All the people running this world are total psychopaths
peace not war
Opinions are like arseholes everyone has one. Let's keep it black and white.
What a joke
What are Moscow's demands? That Ukraine become a part of Russia permenantly?
Only the dead have seen the end of war.
Demands? Its obvious,   Putins demands:   Lift the sanctions on Russia, and we'll stop the attacks on Ukraine.  The question is, will he keep his promise? Somehow, I don't think so. This man is dangerous with a capitol D!
Somebody somewhere is making lots of money out of this invasion I wonder who
Time for him to be overthrown. Delusional.
The refugees getting out of Ukraine going into Europe will eventually cause allot of problems for the countries they fled too. And many in those countries when things get tough will blame the refugees for it . Many people do not mind helping others .But eventually they want those refugees out .Because of less resources .And their cost of living standard going down. There just are not enough jobs to be created for the millions of new people entering their country . So those countries working families know they will personally be paying for those families threw higher taxes . It is one thing to have allot of money .But most people are not in that good of a situation.
What are the demands??
“Il stop invading your country when you finally give up your ambitions as a sovereign nation and surrender your future to me and the new Soviet Union” is pretty much his demands. Nothing new has changed.
End the war and start peace ✌️
Russian army is useless, all they have is nuclear weapons to threaten people.get rid of nuclear and they would be destroyed.
Putin ur a bully.u will b taught a lesson
A bully
Of course, Putin will cease fire if Moscow’s demands are met. That is why he went to war.
This says nothing.
Yes end it with Ukraine..but he must be handled or eliminated even if peace comes between the two Putin should still be taken out ..
If you believe this is anything but a distraction you aren’t very sophisticated
I say give him what he wants and let him answer to his own people now that he’s all but destroyed their economy (which was only the size of the state of Texas BTW).
So basically he is still telling the same thing what he said before war "Don't oppose us, surrender, give up and let Russia takeover Ukraine" 🤣😂. He has already destroyed many parts of Ukraine now if his conditions are met he will keep doing same things with other Non-NATO members 😡
So your going to deliver such important news to us and fail to mention the demands? Where is the other female news reporter she is brilliant, she is the reason I’m even subscribed to this news station
Wait a moment, shouldn't it be, Ukraine would stop fighting only when Russia ends it invasion and not the other way round?
Slavah ukraine
You can not say you love God and on the other hand killing people
So  what are those conditions then?
then what are those conditions?....
Say it 50 million times over and over again moscow demands met. I thought WION was a different news but it has got the disease of indian channels of repeating same thing over and over again. Lets do a 1 hours segment and you can repeat same thing over and over and over again shaking hands.
No deal.many casualty and damages done.Putin also bleeds.
In war..no winners..both side will become losers.. 😎
Its a simple fix. Stop fighting . Bring peace saves lives. Then Ukraine and its allies fight from a different economical and trade play field. While resetting the table for a more strategic  play field in the future.
what are those demands?
The only people who lose in war is the PEOPLE
Pretty newsanchor
' Ukraine 🇺🇦 ' White Flag saves Lives ' GIVE IT UP ' ! ❤️ ! " Responsibility Matters for ALL Lives " !
Well I think the world should turn there back on any country that commits crime against humanity..let's be real. The people of Russia r guilty for allowing this . It's the third country in a decade..and the people of Russia do nothing..they need to have a massive strike drop .guns,pens , shovel r the tool of your trade..just stop enabling him. 99%of the people on earth just want to live..yet we alow 1%to turn us on each other..how weak r we as a species
Peolple start thinking, when the danger knocks on their own door. With COVID they have knocked on every door in the world. Yet the People have seen the devil's claw, looking out of their fancy suits . Vaccine side effects are rising by the day but not registered.  Do you really think we let you scums get away with this. Wrong. It is of course very sad that Klaus Schwab's friends have considered the UN actions to be necessary over the past few months, but the cat is already out of the bag. This kind of diversionary maneuver will no longer work. 😁 There is no way back. Klaus Schwab or Blackrock and Vanguard & "CO" won't be very happy about that. Now the "CO" ( hiding behind the scenes), I suggest, would all have to flee to Mars very quickly with their money launderer Elon Musk. What's even funnier is that if they hadn't gone nuts, they might be up to mischief for another 100 years. Well it is what it is. This is about people. We demand Klaus Schwab and all  his friends down. This is what this movement is about and Nothing else. Vanguard and Black Rock bosses behind the scenes, We are coming after you. You will take your "Digital ID" wish, with you, to the grave. This will end, when you END......
Time to remove WION on youtube
How is this a story?  Russia will stop only if their demands are met and Ukraine totally surrenders?  How is that a change?  Russia demands everything and offers nothing.  Again.
What are the demands though? What kind of reporting is that? Demands that Ukraine  will kiss Putin and Russians ass and thank them for invasion?
Putler's conditions will NOT be even considered by Ukraine, we'll fight as much as needed, we're winning, and we will win.
Shit news channel, clickbait tilte. Disliked
That is like a school bully telling you that he'll leave you alone if you stop trying to defend yourself from his punches.
Yep stop defending yourself from the rapist and then the rapist may stop raping you. PATHETIC!
Dislike.  WHAT are the DEMANDS?  You keep repeating the same things over and over.
Of course, that's the Putin Condition...in other words, Putin wants Ukriane to capitulate
"Whaal de meer Puuhteen" Love it that you've made him Indian!
BS
How can Putin be trusted when they have proven they don't honor their word?
Putin Never had to do this from day one...Putin is a wicked dog
Russia will run out of aircraft before Ukrainians run out of stinger missiles.  There are no conditions for ending the economic war against Russia. The war is being won decisively and will not end until Russia no longer has an economy. It wasn't very large or strong to begin with and it is completely defenseless.
Who in the hell  puttin think he  is  hes a  nobody Putin is  scare  to  come and do it himself
Attention, listen, do not be afraid, do not trust only in the power of imperfect men, but trust in the power of our creator, because nothing is impossible for him. it's a matter of you trusting in faith.
Someone remind Erdogan about Turkish invasion of Cyprus, Greece and Armenia.
Don't meet Moscows demands. Unify world forces and crush Russia forever !
No se como es posible., que este señor., logre hablar de esa manera., que todo el que contribuya con any ayuda a Ucrania será considerado enemigo., come on., que somos ignorantes o cobardes.
I am not an expert but.. this reporting is so 😵‍💫😵‍💫😵‍💫😵‍💫😵‍💫 Bring Palki back!
What are Moscow's demands????Tune in later to find out. 😳😳
What are the conditions???
Ukraine isn't fighting. Its defending itself.
And the demands were?
I’m sure his demands are for Ukraine to give up, demilitarize, and let Putin install a puppet government.
BS Putin is getting cripple now he wants cease fire.
So no change then?
Just like Russia's little Napoleon to think that he should be the one setting the terms. Someone should teach him the word "compromise".
He better pardon himself before he gets indicted to SDNY.
Karma never leaves anyone....Mr Putin
Russian doesn't want   bombardment the Ukraine  if zalensky  just give up. It' will save Ukraine People and prevent their city from collapse.  He asked Ukraine  people to resist  Russian troops, actual he doesn't care about Ukraine  people because he is Jews.  The Ukraine jews are ready to be saved by Israel. How about the Ukraine people ?  they just victim of the stubborn of Zalensky, he insist to join NATO. We will now  the ending (if God willling) , the Zalensky will escape  or catched like Sadam Husein in  Iraq. so please just give up don't let Ukraine people suffer.......and the country destroyed. Just make win-win solution for the people of Ukraine.
Did I just see Putin try to give Erdogen the fist bump?
Turkey, which has invaded Cyprus, asking Russia to stop invasion. How double standard world is.
True? I hope as world peace is what we aim for.. :)
Ukraine: ok  Russia: surprise bicth (still invading)  World: So that was a fcking lie
The script was repetitive and you did not tell us anything...
They should leave the sanctions affective for a decade.
He should help Venezuelan people 🇻🇪   Stop protecting Maduro Lost election Putt'ttin just show me the money 💰
Peace full Meeting on Ukraine Russia Invade.
Ukraine was a racist, hate filled nation. Putin is moving with no hesitation while he has NATO frozen to do anything military without fear of getting nuked into oblivion.   The world power structure changed over night.  At least we don't have to worry about training camps for the far right, white supremacist going forward with the eradication of Ukraine.   Research that, cause they were openly practicing racism and training Europeans.  Mostly from NATO nations. So, they are supporting keeping racism going and white supremacy. They knew about the Aryan training camps and Ukraine was openly practicing racism as national holiday.  They  are reaping what they have sown.
Moscow should be bombed by the World
Don’t believe either one of those dictators.
The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants. It is it’s natural manure.
ratputin
Why is Turkey part of NATO ?
Why Erdogan is taken so seriously? Not required
If russia invade Ukraine. India support russia. Then Kashmir, Naga, Punjab and Tamilnadu are the state asking freedom from India. will india accept it.
It's Simple, Vladi: you retreat all Russian troops and end all hostilities. Then you present yourself at the International tribunal for warcrimes. Then, the conflict will end.
so what are the conditions??? incomplete news...
She's HOT
stop this mofo.. if putin wants a fight me and him can get it on. im 5,'11 180lbs pounds mma fighter (not pro) just underground. lets  go. he can set the terms.. i don't care just please stop this please. ill fold this mofo like a peace of paper but i can lose he can beat me up i wont fight back just please stop this senseless killing.
What are the demands?
Putin the New Terrorist
Bravo Turkey. Behind Ukrajina's back, you conduct peace talks. How many rubles did Putin promise you. How much gas and oil does this betrayal cost? How much is Turkish Honor worth how much?
Then what is there demands????
whether putin ends the fight or ruins what he did, the lives of the people who died cannot be restored.  putin should be punished.
Looks like the United States is gone from a strong country to one of the most cowardice countries it is accumulating under the present administration that ever was Biden is weak and in this country by the day is vice president don’t know anything about anything how to do anything except tide like Biden did during before the election so he’s making this country such a big coward we’re letting Putin holders at so-called gunpoint by threatening nuclear reaction so isn’t that a war crime itself he’s about to destroy the world and And Biden is helping him do it where is Congress at where is the NATO at all I’ve heard so far is talk talk talk Coward coward coward Putin threatens and they jump through a hoop next you’ll be telling them when they can and can’t go to the bathroom that’s getting to be the American country we used to be strong stand up for our rights and other peoples rights not anymore we got a coward in the White House and an idiot for a vice president and a Congress they don’t know the rear end from the hole in the ground and don’t know how to straighten out things that are going wrong that’s my opinion
Screw Russia..
This news channel: putin will end the invasion if these conditions are met but only after these things happen that meet his conditions that we will tell you eventually?
What are the demands ?
Putin ask even US not to interfere in other country matter.
Not gonna happen, in for a bumpy one come mid May and 10s of thousands of deaths a stalemate guerilla war and urban destruction.
My Ukrainian  Mother Would Be Going there to Fight if She were Alive!
Now Russia issue cease fire,and take rest,later we will see.
...& I had answered  some questions in exams in that same way.  War crisis ! stand strong Ukraine
Putin is a LIAR and cannot be trusted.
Big brother will never agree to a ceasefire. Unfortunately..
Zelensky can stop this un minutes, he just needs to tell his troops to stop fighting, but since he or any of his families are not the one being killed, he has no problem continuing with this conflict.
Putin is so badass. Long live russia.
The US Military Industrial complex dislikes this report.
Putin's stand may be one's stand when it happens
So, what exactly are those "demands" (in plural)?
Putin if Ukraine stop killing Russian soldiers if his demands is meet… this man is out of his mind 🤯
Feed the MONSTER  ??  That has never been a good thing    Sign this or I will Kill You   ?? Whata deal  Can you believe that Humanity is still Barbaric Crude  and Stupid even in 2022    Putin is personally responsible for this INSANITY
Is demilitarize & subject yourselves to me a reasonable demand ???? Would he and his rebels stop armed conflict if Ukraine offered him Crimea, Donbass & Luhansk ????
Just give the conditions to avoid more bloodsheddd. Many people had already lost their son or father in this war.
WHAT ARE THE DEMANDS?!!!!!!!????
Lmao... Yer that's gunna happen
I love Putin we Indian want pok
Putin will forever be remembered as a controversial and an ATROCIOUS figure for all those people (including chidlren) he killed in Ukraine. DEPLORABLE INDEED.
Is Russia attacking country’s and letting the world pay for its repairs in a strategic way to weaken global markets?
Russia will destroy European economic by this war that's the real goal.
What’s the difference in between a “military operation” and “war”?? What are those demands?? This report is incomplete.
well Putin can shit in one hand wish in the other and see which one fills up first
Don't believe Putin ever, remember.
Lets pray for good results and for hope for peace ❤
Honestly, Putin drew first blood. That was his first mistake. His second mistake was sending in untrained, green troops to fight a civilian population he had to know was going to rise up and fight back. His third mistake was fighting during the transition between winter and spring. There is a reason why Germany waited until June 22, 1941 to launch Operation: Barbarossa -- so that the mud wouldn't be a hindrance. For someone like Putin, who should have known better, he fell into an arrogance that he can't win against.  After all: "Never interrupt your enemy when he's making a mistake." ~ Sun Tzu, _The Art of War_
While people  killed the  two presidents  exchange gift to each other!  What a shame!
Moscow is losing. Ukrainians need to keep the pressure. Puting is looking for a way out.
Putin is a dishonest deceitful person . You cannot believe a word he says.  Similar to that Trump guy.
Be at least specific when you say "Moscow's demands are met" kya news channel banega re tu 🤦‍♂️
Same conditions that were demanded when they met in Belarus or has there been any movement?  Regardless, for Ukraine to stop fighting would be the accept the fate of becoming a Russian puppet state subject to whoever rule Putin's operators would install in dubious elections.  That is something that should give pause to all former members of USSR, as well as their former Warsaw Pacts underlings, including all the Baltic states and we have also had some interesting news that Finland might be implicated in terms of Russians trying to flee their own country into Finland supposedly to escape possible martial law, but could also be part of a scheme to infiltrate that country the same way Russia set up it's case for invading Ukraine.
Very much talking but nothing on point. Where are these demands? Or whatever he said, how did you know what was said behind closed doors. You just speculate, but just hope that smth good will come to end that war.
Kay.ay.jarore.tha
THE UKRAINIAN ARMY TOGETHER WITH THE PEOPLE TURNS THE GREAT ARMY OF RUSSIA INTO MEAT. TODAY 11,000 RUSSIAN SOLDIERS KILLED. THERE WILL BE MORE. STOP CRAZY PUTIN. HE IS A SICK TERRORIST.
Love RUSSIA..From India ...Destroy whole EU...
It will stop when biden regime has it's quota on refugees.
And Moscow's demands are?
That's not negotiation its plain stupid. Putin must be desperate. Putin's not going to take Ukraine he has lost on many fronts.
Is this the same guy that lied about invading Ukraine???? Then lied about a cease fire???? This is just another lie...
it is NATO that filled Ukraine with weapons, moved closer to Russia.  And not Russia moved closer to NATO.  Residents of Ukraine (DNR and LNR) themselves asked for independence from Russia and Putin gave it.  Now the inhabitants of these areas are happy and did fireworks in honor of Russia.  Russia is ending the war, not starting it.
Ukraine needs to surrender. The battle is inevitable. They’re begging the world to start WW3 instead. That’s like 2 guys having a 1-1 fight and the other is begging the crowd to get involved. The one guy notices that and pulls a gun out and dares anybody to…    You see how cowards Ukraine are?  SURRENDER. You lost already. Cowards
Even if you stop your nonsense, those sanctions wont go away just like that. There are conditions to lift the sanctions as well. Let your citizens suffer poverty and unemployment for the next couple of years. And couple of decades in isolation from the rest of the world, and putin must do a dance on his office table in moscow
This is not NEWS, its bullshit! What are the demands?
Ever watch a temper tantrum kid in a grocery store? Similar demands. " Mommy I want a toy 😩 😫 😭 😢! "
Wow Putin feeling god, ha? Please remember this mr evilman, one day everything horrific you did to Ukraine 🇺🇦 it will fire back to you and even even worse.  God hears the cries of every Ukrainian.
This is like having a mass murderer burning down your house, killing your family, taking away anything valuable that belongs to you, then Selling you back your "Life".
Russian federation shame on them! you are violating minsk protocol international law UN peace treaty referendum even with your own constitution. Whst kind of President are you. Russia should stop the war in ukraine  because they"re starting the trouble and attacking ukraine soveteign country doing war crimes... Putin always lied its really obvious ! Russian Federation invading Ukraine. MOST PEOPLE OF RUSSIA WILL HATE YOU AND WANTS TO KICK YOU OUT IN RUSSIA.
CONDITIONS  HE WANTS? >> Who Cares at this Point, What He Wants?
Putin is trapping Ukraine.
Basically Putin reaffirmed his old demands:   1. The resignation of the Zelensky government  2. Demilitarisation of Ukrainr 3. Recognition of Crimea as part of Russia   The only thing you added in this coverage is:   4. For Ukraine to stop their attacks on invading Russian forces.   Not to be mean but this is just clickbait you honestly haven't said anything that wasn't already said.
Evil pig  !! His conditions would be a farce, another set of blatant lies. GOD CURSE THAT MAN.
He's the aggressor, he needs to stop attacking first. Nobody is going to stop defending themselves.
Let Russia take back its troops from ukraine and let ukraine people live in peace. If Ukraine joins NATO and proves to be a security threat to the Russian country , then the russian President has shown the world how Russia can protect its self from any invasion from NATO or American country. This Russian invasion of Ukraine has put a great scar on ukraine and its people. No courtry should support the expansionist policy in this century, has we have known the results of the expansionist ideology which result in the destruction and humiliation of the host country.
Ukraine will not accept it
Yes u send a country back to the stone age n u want peace. Rebuilding a country  take ages.  Wish they was a place called wall of shame.
Uhm, no. Putin's army needs to leave. He needs to give back the lands of Ukraine and he needs to compensate for the suffering and damage he has done. He should leave office as well, retire
You'd think full control of the Crimea and Europe's largest Nuclear reactor world be more than enough. What further asset would Ukraine even flaunt to the EU at this point?
The special ops in Ukraine is a little more than a few days operation an Russia citizen are aware of the time line and the Ukraine war in being released in the country
The sanctions are biting deep.
Yeah. If they welcome you with flowers
Click bait
ah baited so hard
Who's ammit?
russia back to pre invasion borders ... and pays reparations to Ukraine ... and Putin goes to jail or into exile ... and then the west will allow Russia to breathe again ... Putin must be stopped and his person defeated ... death would be a merciful outcome for Putin ... he invaded and rapes a peaceful country and now threatens the world with nuclear holocost if they interferr ... we may actually be in the initial stages of ww3 ... meahwhile India might focus its attention on telling the Chinese to get out of Tibet ... Is India responsible for the endless war with Pakistan ??? whose fault is that, India's? ... I expect more insight and wisdom coming from India ... than neutrality and or cowardly playing and pandering in an appeasement game ... Wion is better than this ... neutrality in the face of beastiality is cowardness or ignorance or both ...
WARNING - this video does not mention anything about Russia's demands so if you've read the title of this video, save your two minutes and watch some cat video on YouTube. WION is really disappointing with such click bait videos these days.
Ukraine isn't gonna accept until there off everything even donbass
This wasn't news. This was a headline being repeated over and over.  It's like reading the title of a book and claiming that's the whole story.
Tyrants Terrorism...all rules are for common man only
🇳🇦🇳🇦🇳🇦🐸🐸
Putin started it, but neither he, nor anyone else now can stop it.  That is the brutal logic of launching a war in Ukraine, as the Germans and Russians learned to their dismay in 1939.  No one can stop this now. It has acquired a momentum all its own.
First stop fighting .....who started this mess called  :Special Operation and invaded Brothers ?
What is the said demands?
Please don't believe in the communist says, look at what communist has done, don't be cheated as South Vietnam in 1973 agreement in Paris, but North Vietnam is still fighting and in 1975 North Vietnam under China and old Russia supports, they invades South Vietnam and wins the war.
0:40 i like how putin wanted to do a fist bump lol
Putin is so weak, so so weak. Now he decides to withdraw?
This isn’t news 😒
Nice
I thought I'm going to find out his demands! stupid video
Ok... gotcha... so the news is: Putin's has demands..... and?!
So he wants then two sarender that's not going to happen
What are the demands you're a hell of a news organization by saying yes they're only going to stop the war the demands are met will tell us what the demands are traced get the heads out of your asses
What are the conditions
Let's stop this war end trauma, this won't help anyone. I would like to live a long life...😥😥😥😥💔💔
It will be so crazy if Ukraine actually wins against the giant Russian army and then Putin is overthrown and put in jail being replaced by a pro-ukranian president
Aka the fighting will continue.
Soon Russia will be so destroyed economically,that people of Russia will overthrow this regime.Ukrain will be rebuilt with the help of the world, but Russian sanctions will make Russia something like Iran even worse.They will have nuke, but people will live in a hell and the world will isolate them.I feel sorry for the Russian people they don’t deserve this.
Down, down with PUTLER
It false Putin lying about ending invasion to get away with it so they can believe everything he said.
Slava Ukraine.
This is when Ukraine underestimated the threat from Russia!! Wars will solve no problems...only intensify conflicts...now can anybody guess the end game of all this???
Eye washing again and again.
How do you make a diplomacy with someone who suffers from, according to Latvian former President, psychopath, narcissistic, megalomaniac, mean and evil? It’s just a waste of time coz he won’t listen to anyone but himself 🤷🏻‍♀️ I think Russians and the government should work together and fix this problem.
stop the clik bite
Russia is ask for the same conditions that Ukraine as already said no to
And I thought those conditions would be summarized here in this video, Nope
Don't trust him!
Its really dangerous situation to entire world by continuing the war,   Due to this all middle class people will suffer a lot to lead their life.
The more that Russia fights , the poorer Russia gets
Mr. Zelensky you have been very badly fooled and ditched by the west. Now it's all your call. Make a wise decision and your country is leaning on you. You already have made enough enemies coming in west's coax.
Thank you lord🙏🙏🙏🙏
Putin wants to become a new tsar, his conditions are opposite of independency. 😣
Then, accept them ! Enough with that war !
Victoria Nuland and her husband KAGAN, as the Clinton couple are not mere ideologues, they get rich considerably at the pace of the arms industry like Dick CHENEY 800 military bases or establishments, in 177 countries, for a total of more than 200,000 men, many of them in Europe (35,000 in Germany alone, 12,000 in Italy), and especially in the countries bordering the borders of Russia, in defiance of all the commitments made following the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact, encircling – peacefully of course – each year a little more the country of the “very aggressive”
Insane that his troops are being sent into the meat grinder with no fuel or enough supplies ......they are loosing badly ;S this is concerning for russians because this maniac keeps pushing them into certain death when their own army cant provide for them. still he bangs his hammer and gives ukraine ultimatums....this should be the other way around soon
They need to go in and take out Putin
But, what are Moscow's demands?
Literally zero information news. What demands?
The Crazy Man, Putin cannot carry on his crazy work.  Now U-turn and demand his way.  Will Putin get?  I say, YES!!!!!!!
Time for Ukraine to teach Russia a lesson for invading Ukraine. Time to use guerilla tactics against the Russian army.
The Russians will stop when the corruption from the western political people is dealt with  Until that is completed Russia will not stop.
Well that didn’t tell us a lot
Tell Putin nuts. One he needs to stop shelling cities.  Two pull back all Russian forces back to their pre war
Repeat the same sentence three times .. mow thats news...lmao.  not
Why don't the neighboring countries send in a continues stream of UNMARKED military, the same thing Putin did in Crimea?
No, No Putin Demands, back to Russia
WHAT ARE THE DEMANDS FFS
Well what were the conditions!?!
What's Moscow's demand. Wtf is this?
Is it all NATO can do is talk talk talk talk talk talk like good as NATO if a country can’t join it this country is being bombarded and unnecessary invoke war in NATO should be stepping in and let
It's great news!!! Mr Zelensky it's a golden opportunity for you to use the instrument of surrender in a respectable manner.
The top 1 condition is surender your russian president on ukraine citizens and armys
These are not peace conditions,  these are demands by Putin to ensure Putin wins the war he started and takes control of Ukraine.  Where does it state that Russia will fully withdraw from Ukraine?  Where does it say the Ukrainian government will be fully recognized?   Where does it say that Russia will compensate Ukraine for the immense damage to the Ukrainian cities?
Omg these so called news reporters havent mentioned what he demanded! Thats emmy award winning journalism at its finest lol
It means Ukraine surrender and subjugated.Will India as tge world's largest democracy OK with that?What if china takes Ladakh in a similar fashion and tell you,"We will stop attacks if you stop fighting."
So what are the conditions. You've repeated yourself multiple times with no answer.
You mean bow to you Putin.  No chance!!!!!!!!!!!    No chance!!!!!!!!!!!
After years of provocations from America and its fazal countries, Putin is 100% right. Only nobody wants to see that and knows nothing about history because all media send one-sided messages. Just think, how illogical it is, if you NEVER hear a dissenting voice, that alone is suspicious, even if you have a different opinion. Everyone seems to be asleep.
Ukraine should quote Braveheart. “Before we let you leave, your commander must cross that field, present himself before this army, put his head between his legs, and kiss his own arse.”
WION is going the other channels way. Repeating the same sentences continuously, just to fill in the time, dragging the news unnecessarily ... we stopped listening the other channels because of this stupidity
Russia act of war are justifiable, west need to stop provacation on russian federation and let ukraine be a neutral state. The real blood of innocent are on america, nato and zelensky hand, not on putin.
So what you are saying is nothing changed.... He wants Ukraine to give up, allow the invasion to happen and he wants them to "demilitarize" I'm sorry that is just dumb to ask a nation that you do not control and are actively invading.
Clickbait. Nothing about any detail of the demands.
This is the most useless news report. Tell us the conditions
Well what are the demands? She said the same shit over and over
We don't live in a just world. UN powerless. Abolish vetoes in security council, majority vote rules, ALL violators face punishment. Ukraine gave up nukes in 90's, trusting Europe and Russia, now look what happened. We Iranians almost faced similar US attack in early 2000's, which would have been illegal and criminal. No American soldiers shall lay foot on Iranian soil, because we have the military detterent to hit them back very hard.
Russia has to pay for the rebuilding of Ukraine to be part of the deal
STOP FIGHTING by Ukrain against Russia??? Its a nonsense idea. Continue fighting with Russia until Putin evil madness will bring into hell. In just a few days we will see Putin like a rotting rat.
in short: nothing significant happened
UKRAINE SHOULD BE BOMBING RUSSIA!!! What Are They Waiting For.. Give Putin What He Deserves!!! >> THEY OWE HIM AT LEAST THAT MUCH. RIGHT??
I civili ucraini e i soldati russi muoiono mentre Putin partecipa a comizi. Che bel modo di fare la guerra, minacce, richieste impossibili e ordini dati dalla sicurezza di un alloggio protetto.
If course there gonna be Allie’s there both chauvinistic pigs.
He talks a lot of crap  , lies  most of the time...?.
Because he's gotten his ass handed to him. Russian logistics are in shambles evidenced by looting
Russia should totally withdraw and return territories Russia took. Let Ukraine decide for its future.  Meanwhile, Uk is calling for a meeting to make harder sanctions against Russia on Monday. It looks like it will not be pretty for Russia as the sanction continues on for days and years. In the end, the 11th biggest economy have no match for the EU, NATO and allies
AMERICA TO LET LINGER THE WAR AND DESTROY EUROPEAN ECONOMY AND CHINESE SUPPLY CHAIN
Putin is a coward!!
What are the demands?
let me tell putin who want to attack ukraine so who the invador..  dictatorship and a communism... we democrat we live in peace..do not lied .....
Nice we support you Mr Putin to end d war ty
Russia is feeling the pressure of the sanctions .. stock market crashed and ruble is down in the shithole ..otherwise Putin would never have come to a compromise ..
hm hm... and the demands are?.... great news coverage peeps keep on the "good" work -.-'
Putin is wrecking Bidens playground
Woow Im so happy to see this  good news!At least there's still a hope to end this war.
🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
ffs tell us what the demands are !
Ukrainian comedian has made it all worse. Kept it on as if it’s a reality show.
Russia makes demands Ukraine stop  fighting. I might not be aware, please remind me, which site is an agressor and which defends its independency?
Russia: "if Ukraine stops fighting" huh? Putin You are the one that started this fight to BEGIN WITH!! you are the one that should STOP FIGHTING RUSSIA!!
Ukraine will not stop fighting, the whole world is Ukraine now, until Putins die.
In english please 😂
Ukraine better to be with Russia than Poor Europe who are dependent on other countries for everything. West just provoked Ukraine for all these so they could save their defence services.
This war is the same as all wars. When power and wealth are out of balance with the population, this ALWAYS happens. Humans are defective this way, and always have been. No other animal on earth acts this way.
This means Wor the supper power be ready this man has no yet started hie will end up killing 10m innocent civilians as you watch him don't be afraid do something before hie takes on the next step you will not like it...
Why will they stop, the war machine is making money in america
Putin is an evil animal.. why the hell should Ukraine give up their country to that animal..he has no right to set conditions.. Russia needs to stop fighting and get the hell out of the Ukraine...
Where wereall these countries, when afganistan was under taliban, n they left no stoned turned to create horror for people living there. No country was even ready to provide refuse. War is war, no matter where it happens, but people pay attention to specific place, where their interest matters d most.
Putin and why not you stop fight leave ukraine.
What are the conditions?
This loser may dictate the rules in his country, but we will in no way allow this loser to tell us how to run our business outside
So what are his conditions ? Is to own the whole of Ukraine ?
Ukraine must stop fighting as soon as possible.  Russia's demands must be met now.
If Moscow's demands are met? Well what exactly are the demands? I'm sure we already know, but should have explained them explicitly in this clip. Would have been nice.
Nobody is seriously understanding why this war is started....I saw a report that US has setup 6 biological weapons labs in Ukraine.
I hope Zeleeenskyyy will not be stubborn to end this war just give the  conditionsss and stop keeping in touchhh with the wesst, you just witnessed they won't help.
Stop fighting so he can walk in n take over that cold war criminal. He must lay his hands off civilians.
Gee maybe they could have just listened to some of these conditions before this tragic and unnecessary invasion…
am Praying for you all
Putins demands , Ukraine surrender , NATO  pull back to pre 1990 , Russia be allowed to reoccupy all eastern Europe. That's about it
Apart from 'stop fighting us', when we invade your country, what are Putin's terms? Replace Zelensky, with a hand picked Putin backed leader? Give up democracy? Execute Zelensky for having the courage to defy you? Destroy all your weapons to defend yourself? Pay reparations to Putin for his invasion of Ukraine? What?
Poor people. 🇺🇦. F Putin.
Never surrender to evil
The same conditions as before. Ukraine needs to surrender in order for Putin to back out.  Just level him.
US isn't making deals with terrorist ! Ever !
NATO: BIRDS OF SAME FATHER FLOCK TOGETHER. NATO : NOW A LIABILITY FOR THE USA
Putin has to be removed ASAP, thats the only solution. How dare is asking demand while he is not in his own country.I think putin is not in a good mental health.
Demands as if to forget they are the aggressor? Translation: they want Ukraine to surrender. The same bullshit manipulation talking points from Russia just keep on coming doesn't it.
So Putin wants what he has always wanted. Not Going to happen.
Click bait:What demand that's why i watched this video?
Russia should compensate Ukraine.  for life.
Nice for neutral reporting wion..
I really hope this headline is true if it's clickbait blocked
Very amateur news reporting !!¡!!!!
Sometimes you must war to get peace. Peace at any price is worthless. It's Ukraine choice. 🇺🇦
Putin will only cease fire if Ukraine stops fighting.. Does that mean that his forces are on defense now? It doesn't seem like his character to stop until he believes that he has won.
MORE
Oppose sanctions ... That says alot
MIDGET CZAR, LA PUTINA.
*
Putin’s only condition is that NATO will not go any further East than Poland and Ukraine stop trying to join NATO. Until then, war rages on. The End!
Main demand ist stop putting weapons in Ukraine and declare that they cant join Nato...which is really not that hard...to stop all the bloodshed...just do it now...and peace is there. The price of Peace must be met, always.
the conditions are pretty obvious isn't it?  Zelensky steps down so Putin can install a puppet regime.
Wh o gives him the right? Blow Putin to bits!!🙏🙏
War criminal DONT BELIEVE THIS MAGGOT FOR ONE SECOND HITLER HAS BERN VOMITED UP AS PUTA-in
The end of the old age is upon us ….time to turn guns into ‘swords’ ..hear scrap metals at an all time high - x
What are Moscows demands laid out, word for word?
Putin feels the Sanctions now, soo good!
Conditions?! He need to pay for all the damages in Ukraine
Next Taiwan with china
So what are the demands?????
This demented Dictator it is imperative that he and all his thugs are tried for war crimes.
It should under the term of  Ukraine then Russia because Russia is the one desperate of negotiations
Putin wants Ukrainians to stop fighting but keep dying, and to accept his puppet government. He wants UNCONDITIONAL surrender of Ukraine, which he feels belongs to him.
praying for World Peace
Lousy coverage  She just repeated again and again the title
Interesting how the ones that declare war are never the ones fighting said war.
Peace? Turkish drones are hiting russian armour in war
That is not new... come on
Ukraine stop fighting? They are just defending themselves! And what exactly are Moscow demands!? Cant call it a "peaceful" agreement after what Putin has done...
The only solution is to send a nuc into the kremlin , problem solved till the next wing nut like hitler and putin come along do it now! ( I refuse to capitalize anyone who is a war criminal)
That's hilarious Putin thinks he can set conditions.  He's already totally toast and now demanding to become burnt toast.
Just wait for the Russian ground troops to try and hold the cities.  That's when Russia will suffer incredible losses.
Bruh, Russias demands for a ceasfire are "Ukraine stops fighting" "NATO removes all soldiers out of Eastern Europe permanently" "No new NATO members" "No sanctions"" "Ukriane must not join NATO. Only the last is viable.
You can't make somebody love you using force...
You forgot to include what the demands are 🙈🙈🙈
You expect WION news to be punctual? ☠️
The demand is Ukraine surrender because Russia invaded,  makes sense if you are Putin
Well, they really needed some training.
Keep fighting ukraine
so basically let me do whatever i want.
If Putins assasinated problem solved period evil people like him have a place reserved in hell for them
Praying for Ukraine
What demands ????   Don't bomb my Toyota 🙄
Zelensky : Never surrender, fight until  we extinct 😂, NATO : we send you prayers US : Angels will protect you😇
Conditions?  He’s not in any position to demand conditions.  His economy is suffering, his military doesn’t want to participate in the war and the people of Russia are protesting by the millions against Putin. The people of Russia including the military generals need to stop listening to Putin and simply bring their troops home.  They need to go into the Kremlin and remove Putin from office.  Those are the conditions that need to be put in place.
I hope this war goes on for decades.  Russia and Ukraine already have a terrible male to female ratio in their countries.  The more both their men die the better for the rest of the world...this goes for China, Africa and India as well
1) a total cease fire 2) a total withdrawal of ALL troops 3) leave all equipment, supplies and ammunition in place 4) the arrest of Putin for war crimes 5) Russia pays for ALL damages 6) Russia pays restitution to families who lost loved ones, both military and civilian
Surrender....is not negotiation.   Putin does not car how many people die, Ukrainian or Russian.  He is an international terrorist.
Bullshit
Don't lift the sanction to putin's country.
There are no conditions to begin with...
The government of UKRAINE The problem is not RUSSIA ...
Erdogan did great job.
Pooptin takes ur demands and put it in a place where the sun doesn’t shine from Ukraine and it’s people
The same condition  and reason that's why  the war begin..Its not going to work for Ukraine especially now lot's of lives are already gone and sacrifice for the freedom they want.Yet the Russian military combat is worst.God bless Ukraine 🙏🙏🙏
SO? what are the ceasefire demands? puttin must think he is God or something.
Go Russia Go.
ones freedom should not infringe upon others right to existence. ukraine has a long border with russia and can ukraine guarantee that US / Nato wont put up defense equipments, missiles along russia's border? they cant.   ukraine is trying to go against genuine security interests of russia- why then they want to join nato?  that is the problem and that is why russia is doing this military intervention.  If ukraine can announce that they wont join Nato, they intend to  stay neutral as a free independent nation, that they recognize the security risk for Russia and wont allow US or Europe to set up bases in Ukraine,  am sure Russia will stop the war. Russia does not want to occupy or colonize ukraine and so that will pave way for lasting peace in both ukraine and russia.
No conditions, just leave.
so what are the conditions?
Viva Russia Viva Putin
রাশিয়ার উচিৎ ইউক্রেনের ইহুদি প্রেসিডেন্টকে প্রকাশ্যে ফাঁসি দেওয়া।এটা হবে পশ্চিমাদের জন্য একটি কঠিন শিক্ষা।....
What are the conditions?
Full support to Russia ❤💪
Hahahaha Putin to Ukraine " Please I beg you stop fighting because you are winning and I am going to lose my job :("
Putin has set conditions, conditions are.. conditions has to be met! Nice conditions
I think you are boring, by years President Putin asks the same. Americans do war with using others people. May be one day they will have a big war on their nation.
So, Putin demands everything his way and only his way - as usual - and then he will stop slaughtering innocent civilians? The brutal dictator once again dictates life and death over Ukraine purely for his own hubris and authoritarian power. Putin sucks.
Yeah, what conditions?
This news anchor speaking in south asian accent
Shoud be Stop war  mr putin,otherwise  you must be losses  your power.
get deep state cabal km nwo aholes out for good.
Bombard the white house and Nato head quarters.
kinda dumbp u just keep repeeating one statement without elaboration
The only way to end the war, is to take the prick out.
and his demands are?????????
The devil's in the details, what demands?
When the righteous cry for help, the LORD hears, and delivers them out of all their troubles. The LORD is near to the brokenhearted, and saves the crushed in spirit. ~  A Psalm of David, Psalms 34:17, 18  🕊   [RSV]
How about the lives of another 10,000 Russians? I think that will put an end to this.
Why don't you tell it like it is. Putin is demanding the unconditional surrender of Ukraine before he will call off his invasion. The Russia bully is about to meet his own Stallingrad and watch his empire become a 3rd world country as his economy is destroyed.
Super good news
Good luck with Ukrainian stop “fighting” Vlad. Ukrainians defending them self Vladik
i dont trust Putin the next Hitler...
Putin's going to black mail extort hold a gun to there head by setting conditions. I wish trump was running things. Let Putin get away with this.. what's next for him or anyone who wants to hold the world hostage threaten nukes. Screw Putin. We Americans ought to be taking our own crooked ass government to war.
Well, this guy is aching to nuke anyone.
What are Moscows demands????????  You neglected to mention the most important part of this message!!!
The West must keep the sanctions for a long time.
I’m not sure what Russia hopes to achieve , they’ve now created generations of people who will forever hate Russia. All these children affected will remember who destroyed their homes, schools, neighborhoods, and families. There will be no effective way to rule over Ukraine even with a puppet government….unless he intends to kill all these innocent people.
Why does it sound like this "news" organization supports Putin?
What about refugees from former Yugoslavia, when western countries ware involved in conflict.
So what are the demands?
Demands?? Where is it?? Is this news reporting?,
So basically they will only stop the invasion if the Ukraine people surrender? does not sound like a good deal to me translates to "surrender or die" and if they do surrender they will most likely also "die" , Another stalling tactic perhaps...
What are the conditions?  Ukraine surrrender?  Sorry, not happening.
so let me get this straight: putin wants ukraine to stop fighting and give in to everything he asks for so the war will stop? that's literally surrender. lol
So the Russian path to peace is for Ukraine "stop fighting and give in to all Putin"s demands'. So like, surrender your arms, give up your fight for democracy and surrender your sovereignty.  Sounds fair.
Don’t trust that mad man, he is bound to eat Ukraine. Ukraine is fighting for themselves
oh and never again threaten atomic war by blocking Croatian drinking and service water ever again
He makes no sense. Stop invading and they’ll stop fighting 🤷‍♀️
putin is ridding ukraine of the cabal, karaian mafia, rothchilds, soros, clintons, cia bioweapons labs, child trafficing, dumbs, sex trafficing, white woman trafficing, adrenochrome havesting. satanic child sacrificing, drug trafficing....and so much more. the alliance is doing it world wide, including the usa. only putin can do the headquarters of the new world order cablaists next door to him. send them all to hell to be judged for their crimes against humanity...., putin will deliver them there pronto. then ukraine can return to the almost nice country it was before obama overthrew their duly elected govt back in 2014. the ukraine army is not fighting the russian...who is fighting are the neo nazis malitias installed in 2014 and hired for violence. now you know the rest of the story.
Stop buying Russian oil.
What are the demands????????????????
On not trust Putin
The world must stop this monster for destroying humanity. This is the most dangerous man after Hitler. The west and NATO has let down Ukraine. This monster must be stopped.
Well, it is good to know that Putin will accept the surrender of the Ukraine  asa reason to stop, BUT I still don t believe him. He will continue to take territory and kill those he doesn't agree with.
Gubat mo diha ayaw apil pinas kay daghan wakwak
W4 & juju let me
What are the Moscow's demand??
What are the demands??
Putin is a good man.he is Hero
So what are the fucking demands?   Jeez
He is not in a position to put conditions. Sanctions are killing him
Putin invaded Ukraine,now he wanted Ukraine to stop fighting,in order for him to stop the conflict…!? How irrational is Putin ? Can’t stand still and let Putin slaps you around,Ukraine is on defense….
For a news item it tells us very little
so whats moscow's demands are?
Can US & NATO guarantee that it would stop the aggression/invade Russia in the future? If they can have agreement on that i think this invasion should stop.. But i doubt it happen.
Nobody dare to arrest a war criminal like Putin???
What Russia started.?
Pretty uninformative lol. What are the demands?? 😆
Putin will only stop of we let him win?? He's started the fight 🤣
Mental putin he is aggresser how defender first stop I have no idea😂😂
What a totally useless broadcast.
Once again a totally misleading headline. This 'report' tells us nothing. Shame on you WION!!
Don’t believe this pathological liar. All warfare STOPS FIRST and CONFIRMED by the Ukraine before any discussions
Hey Putin, how's that great and powerful army you said you had?
Let him extend the war..it might not break Ukraine but it will surely devastate Russian economy..Russia cannot fight for more than a month with such huge sanctions, finance drain and isolation at home and abroad.
Ukraine can stop this easily.. Surrender and stop getting your people killed. SMH.. And he's wondering why no one is helping.. Too dumb to go and attack Russia's cities.. Instead he wants everyone else to fight his war.
What are the demands? This stinks.
Repeated the same things 4 times in 2 mins. I watched eagerly to know what those conditions were🤦‍♂️
How can one stop flighting when the enemy is present.
President of Ukraine wont agree with that, he will sacrifice all people in ukraine until he will give up.
Guarantee Ukraine stays a neutral country and end the suffering of the people.
Erogan turkey supremo Godbless you
What Are The conditions!!! What kind of news is this??? When You're only giving headlines and No Content at all!!! Please bé More professional!!!!
and what outlandish demands did they have? (the nationalist russia lives in another universe)
You.expect the Ukrainians to just hand their country on a silver platter? Afterall the trauma and bloodshed Russia caused? You gotta be kidding!
i dont believe it
Down with war criminal putin! Never give up Ukraine! Bleed the aggressors dry! Make the ground run red with blood of the invaders! Slava Ukraini!!!
No War = Peace
Modji did nothing Erdogan is resolving the issue disaster even after buying so much weapon from russia no importance given to our Tyrant
Pointless video update.. if conditions are met... What conditions then .. surrender 😂👍🏽
Stop war
The Russians are having a hard time, they can take Ukraine. But they won't have a military left when it's all over.
testes? Demands? To give up ukraine lol
What are Moscows demands??
Hopefully Ukraine will surrender and agree to denazify themselves. It’s the right thing to do
Sooo? What are the demands?! I asume them to be bs if she isn't mentioning them.
Were is nato and US..now.
This is a US-made Zelenskyy doll, forced at the expense of the Ukrainian people with naive drama.  Enjoy your leader as ukraine folk comedian.
Deductions from this war World will not come to save you Dont depend on superpowers Dont overestimate your ability Dont think that your adversary is that weak
They are lying  and will continue taking over the country
What are those conditions?
LOVE to Ukraine.  To all Ukrainians I say  ''Glory to Ukraine !
Don't put on any conditions and please end this kiling
i hope Russia will be win.
So he said he will stop the fighting when he wins....great.
What about civilian who died in war without knowing
Anyone that trusts that liar is an idiot
News reporting at its best. Reporter repeats herself in 4 different ways but hasn’t said a word.
I pray this war ends very soon.
Manipulators at their work
western power and NATO should advise Ukraine to put weapons down..and sit on the table for talks.
No country can meet the Putin's demand, but putin will die on his toilet seat
Didn’t mention any of the demands, great news coverage 👌🏻👍🏻
What are the conditions? All i heared was the reporter repeating the statement and Ukraine to stop.
Ukraine is winning the war on American controlled media and social media.
So - let's bomb russia!
Putin is wrong Mother Earth will resolve conditions
I love 🇷🇺🇷🇺
Could you please send one bomb to America too . they made bombs but never seen how dangerous They are
There you go, the condition is clear, stop fighting, a meet their demand which i believed is to be neutral and not join nato, grab it, and end the war, stop raising your pride and save your country snd people, stop the suffering ,  accept it, its simple condition , and just demand other ways  like compensate your loses.
Putins demand is like China saying to India that if they surrender all of its nuclear weapon and make no more, they can have the disputed region, would India accept it? Of course not just like how NATO refused Russian demands.  For clarifications I'm talking about Russian demands to NATO.
The world supports Ukraine.
PUTLER KAPUT HAHAHA
Well come onnn , give in on their demands so we can have peace again !!!
Ukraine has the complete right to join NATO to defend themselves from a terrorist state like Russia with a war ciminal at the helm. Russia, that has been making military alliances with China, and has been bombing civilians in Georgia, the Sahel in Africa, and now Ukraine.
There is no such thing as collateral damages, when you go to war this is just one of the expected outcomes. If a civilian chooses to engage a soldier then that civilian becomes an enemy combatant and subject to termination.
Fantastic news… why not elaborate on what the conditions are? Did they change at all?
"Fastest growing refugee crisis ..."  We all know that "fastest growing" means "smallest". New start-up companies never say they are the smallest companies. They always say they are the fastest growing.
Just give him what he wants so the rest of the world can return to normal without so much worry, or before long the west will get more involved and officially start WW3.
...
You see the Yankee feed the conflicts to not end Erdogan is going to Putin to mediated the peace look up on comment all Yankee idiots talk only by war
What about 14000 Donbass people being killed by Ukraine military? Hope, one of the condition is let's Donbass, Crimea and 2 other independent country free to join Russia
Rubbish news
No war,peace and love,stop on both side the fights,too much heartache,stop it now,
How can you attack someone and then set all the conditions for a ceasefire
That's what started ,this unholy war , Putin demands,not Russia demands,  which is not in the best interest for no one but himself, you can fool some people, some of the time but you can't fool, all the people all the of the time
What the demands??
Lets unite and grow towards future. I pray this war ends very soon
What are the conditions!? Ffs
Please please please stop the War please !!!🙏🙏🙏
NATO WILL NOT SUPPORT DIRECTLY . Dont believe NATO. Better Ukraine not join NATO for  people's safe . Russia is not a Aggressor like China trust them they are your brothers. Dont fall in America's trap.
I don't think the Chinese People's Liberation Army is capable of winning modern wars. There was a problem with the communication between their soldiers, soldiers are extremely afraid of death. I think India should establish a military buffer zone with China to help Tibet become independent.
Wish the dislike button was a thing still, would've saved me 5min......
Give up weak ukrain. God bless russia
Liar 🤥🤥🤥 Putin
The USA millions of people into the UK and other places countries if they don't want to fight for their country then they can't fight for them undercorrection Al-Qaeda took over
8 Russia jet fighter  down 6 march
i pray for a god, every one! for a good end to this all. nobody deserves wars. NEVER! also other countrys!
The most powerful man in the world is blocking NATO's plan to a new world order, if Putin's term was done and Russia can't find a tough leader like him then it was time for NATO to attack humanity by implementing mark of the best, human will experience greatly unparalleled tribulation Which was never been Experience before since the world begun! MARK 13:19, so as long as NATO is not showing their true colors yet, then we have still time to repent !.
🇮🇳❤️🇷🇺
So, end it. please
There's lots of violence and hatred in Ukrainian society, it's been for years, like increased domestic violence against women and children.  I cannot imagine that in my country teenage boys, from quite wealth families, could be serial killers, but the "Dnepropetrovsk maniacs" killed 21 people in Mid-Ukraine and wounded many in summer 2007.  Now this 8 yrs of civil war and ultra-patriotism... oh no.
Putin looks like a school boy when he stands close to erdogan, so cute🇷🇺👎🏿
He scared of the sactions
It's all US fault , deploying troops ,Nukes , building military bases at Russian border . Long Live Russia
My Man Putin 😎
Don't  believe  Putin
and destroy the river blockage of concrete to allow water to flow again into Croatia
Russia should protect people from the leader of the West puppets
What a click bait title 🤣🤣🤣🤣
PM MODI NE KUCH NI KAHA WARNA YE RUSSIA TO DAY 2 ME HI WAPAS CHALE JAATEE
LIE'S ! How can Puttin talk with anyone?? When can't even make a good decision himself. He is a VERY SICKO  !!
How about BOTH sides lay down arms TOGETHER and withdraw at SAME time peace treaty is signed.
They tell us ten times that Putin wants conditions met but they never say what the conditions are.  Terrible reporting.
Lies...
Many are the affictions of the righteous; but the LORD delivers him out of them all. He keeps all his bones; not one of them is broken. Evil shall slay the wicked; and those who hate the righteous will be condemned. The LORD redeems the life of his servants; none of those who take refuge in him will be condemned.  ~  A Psalm of David, Psalm 34:19-22  🕊    [RSV]
World many countries made very dangerous harmful bombs  only puttin shows us what  a bomb can do
The face of the Psycho trying to start World War III.  Bully wants conditions so he cant stop bullying.
Putin has the same fate as Saddam Hussein, at the end of a rope. Putin is using Thermatic bombs, which are illegal. weapons. Putin is full of lies and cannot be trusted. Americans stand by Ukraine. Even though our current gov is weak, Americans and American companies are sending more.  Many Russians are bravely standing up in protest.  Putin will fail and fall.  God bless all!!!
Why do they have to always repeat the same thing twice?
Can Macron, Biden or Boris put on their big boy pants and nuke Russia already? The threat of nuclear winter will ALWAYS be there and will only be worse if they take Ukraine. At some point you’re just going to have to bite the bullet and stop using the scare as as excuse to let a country with the economy of Italy bully the powers and economics of the entire free world.
زنده باد اوکراین
NOTHING this monster says can be believed, he's proved it over and over and over.
NATO close the sky of Ukraine!!!! Death to the Kremlin Occupants Maskals🇺🇦🇺🇸🇺🇦🇺🇸🇺🇦🇺🇸🇺🇦🇺🇸
crazy putin
donder op
this news report was useless it didnt give any information on the Russian Demands for ending the war, what are the specific demands?
Omg get to the point
How I wish no war weapons to be invented or created in the beginning of this world. World leaders please bring peace ✌️
Under the current conditions and sanctions imposed on Russian and the future nato supported insurgency they will face if they do succeed in taking Ukraine Russian will simply fail at the war of attrition as its economy fails and the threat of dissension in its ranks grows. All there is to say about it
Putin: Lay down your weapons, Surrender, let me annex you and decide your future  I am 100% positive all Ukrainians are thinking what those soldiers on that island thought:         Idi Naxui Russian Dictator
More power to Putin 💪🏻🇷🇺❤️
Turkey need to control its economy and Lira before telling knowledge to Moscow. Foolish erdagon
nice move president of russia 🇷🇺 god help ash our people love u all
Okay, I've sat through a minute and Fifty-two seconds telling me that Russia will only stop the war, if their demands are met? Now what are those demands? Because you guys failed to enlighten us on those ....
Edwahn is another dictator - do not trust a single word out of his mouth..
Great scale kidnapping and blackmailing..
War is only getting to sadness and poverty even they have other negotiations to avoid war. Some country leaders are not love their people and only want to show their power, so they create unnecessary fighting.
Putin can shove his conditions up where the sun doesn't shine. 👺👹💀💀👺👺👹👹
Its good that not all of the nations joined in condemning Russia, they had a good role to play as peacekeepers.
Every man  woman n child  from every corner of the globe deserves to be  FREE!!!!!!!!  Putin and the likes of him shall never  see the day of light!!!
It will stop if your armies (Russian) will do so. You are the aggressor. This is stupid.
so... what are Moscow's (Putin"s) demands? (besides stop fighting?)
Lesson of Ukraine-Putin war:- Nobody is going to help you are in your own
Only if i had bruce almighty powers🙂.  Peace
So his demands are... that his demands are met? How informative.
There is absolutely nothing of value here. He just asking for a surrender.
If Ukraine surrenders it's time for a new covid variant to hit America while the media tries to bury Ukraine money laundering operations with dirty politicians.
So Putin wants Uekraine to stop fighting, means stop defending and surrender to Putin. Putin is talking nonsense.
I will only stop fighting when you stop fighting so says the fox in the house of chickens.  It's kind of a fancy way of saying that I will stop fighting when you hand over your country to me.  I wonder if you can feel the evil from Putin.
Thats a good news
If the demands will only benefit Poutine, that's all.
Putin old man  debo
Ukraine will not stop fighting. Russia isn't winning.
Nothing is actually promising  If ukraine surrender but political negotiation fail  How it will continue?  Too many responsibility in this issue  Failure can be worse than allow genocide progressed  To alter this situation is too much for our capacity
Not when they stealing the entire south and east coast of the country. . . Keep fighting
00:39   Clearly Putin likes playing rock, paper scissors.
They’re not “Sanctions” they’re special economic conditions.
I don't understand why Ukraine leader telling civilians to fight and when civilians get shot they blame on Russia killing civilians.  Fuk up
Stay strong Ukraine.  Greetings from Denmark.👍
LOL POOHTIN setting conditions to stop the Ukraine invasions after the Russian army gets 'stucked' inside Ukraine
You're not ukrainian putin to put in your hand what's the disteny of Ukrainian don't intervine the Ukraine and the world is in peaceful situation
How about other countries invade Russia and say they would stop invading Russia if they stop resisting the invasion.
In short, he wants Ukraine to surrender
Go Biden, ❤️ U👍🙏
What the hell are their demands, this video is a waste haha  Let them have Donboss and officially Crimea, The UN should offer to re-house any Ukrainians wanting to leave those areas in the west of the Ukraine, let Putin have his tiny Win and save lives.
ICC is willing to wait for him
Putin is wanted dead man. He wouldn’t able to drink a bottle of water with out worries he might get whacked from with inn
Ok then , war is ending!
Another call and no solution.  “Putin had a 15 hr conversation with so and so with no resolution…”
Putin shows the world how dangerous bombs are
If ukraine is ready to truce but usa dont allow it to stop wars.
When you only agree to humanitarian corridors that's code for surrender now or be defeated in a week. It’s already over. Russia just going through the motions now waiting for Zelensky to say it’s over.
If Ukraine puts down weapons...Putin will murder thousands more anyway.
Sanction must not be ease.even if fighting stops.
America and NATO have made a big mistake but they will never admit it that is the biggest truth and America and Great Britain are scumbags they are declining visas to Ukrainian people. So America and Great Britain are NOT ready to welcome Ukrainian refugees
Putin 🤮
Let's end this madness.
When you demand your neighbor to be your slave, I don't think anyone will agree in the 21st century.
Love how people are calling out putin but thinks obama and biden as saviours.theyve killed more civilans and innocent lives than putin has with Ukraine
We're do thèy get such rubbish! Turkey is in NATO and an active part of NATO defence! Ànd is imposing sanctions, thay would not do that! It is most likely that have stated that they may close the strights to the Back Sea blocking the black sea fleet putting more pressure on Putin to stop the wàr!
There are many innocent lives that are loss because of political issue between leaders. These innocent people are sons, fathers,mothers, friends to someone. There is no true winner in a war.
Any country that fights for its freedom and refuse to be ruled over by dictatorship and authoritarianism I respect💪🇺🇦
These fooking Suits need to fight it out  , not the people SMH
Rise up good Russian citizens and remove Mad Man Putin from power, Putin is a Fraud  he is corrupted to the bone, Putin steels Billions from Russian citizens, puts in Oligarchs names and Putin property around the world. Wake up Russian military remove Corrupt Putin from Power,
So basically he saying stop fighting and do as I say then I’ll stop killing y’all? What kind of deal is that? Also what are his terms?
Moscow demands: 1)Ukraine to remain neutral, Not joining NATO. 2)Halt NATO expansion. 3)Legal written Security guarantee for Russia. I think these demands are reasonable.
Thick headed Zelensky should hopefully come to these terms, like the chance to end it is literally RIGHT there, he better not try and continue to make this worse
Hold Russian accountable!
Buddha said "වෛරයෙන් වෛරය නොසන්සිඳේ. " meaning "Hatred does not quell hatred."  Ukraine president must back off to end human suffering.
Putin is going crazy
Ummm I do not think he is the one to be setting "Conditions." Sounds like Putin maybe needs to surrender. He is not in control!!
Vladimir Putin became bombs putting no
Because an idiot tries to play th new fascist Nazi , innocent people pay the consequenses. Putin resign and go to your cell for maniacs
It’s unacceptable that the aggressors who’s murdering the innocent people with prohibited arms, bombarding nuclear sites, hospitals ,schools ,maternity , dares to make conditions, it’s disgusting…🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮😡😡😡👎👎👎👎👎👎👎
After 10000++ Russian dead in Ukraine only putin negotiate for peAce?
Putin is right
Putin shooting for a fist bump and instead receives a handshake.
What are the demands?? Lol not very informative
Putin has lost the war !!!!
NOTHING BUT LIES FROM A SELF CENTERED DICTATOR.. 🇺🇦🇷🇺MAY THE GOOD HEARTED FREEDOM LOVING RUSSIANS AND THE WORLD UNITE AGAINST THIS TRAVESTY. 🌐✊🏻✊🏼✊🏽✊🏾✊🏿🗽
Russia made the west an USA jump like never before🤣🤣🤣🤣 he broke its ego
That is not ending invasion it means fulfilling it. Putin can stick his conditions in his arse.
Sorry Putin., You look weak and Ukraine will keep butchering you
Putin can not be trusted, period! He is losing the war in Ukraine and his own people are suffering the consequences of his madman's actions...
This war will only really positively end if Poopin pulls back entirely from Ukraine and gets rid of his war machine so this S..t will not start again in 1-4 years or Assassinate Poopin and end it all once and for aLL
PUTIN CAN END THIS....SIMPLY FIND A TALL TREE AND A SHORT ROPE...  1.2.3...GERONIMO.. step into space.  THERE ITS OVER!!!!
Stop fighting what a joke, he playing games Russian forces will keep on.
He forgets option number 3 - Putler is eliminated or dethroned
He his real spy shame on them.
The trick game of Putin!!! All is favor of him of course!!!  Thats all ?hOw about the damages the dead people both Russian and Ukraine soldiers only CONDOLENCE REST IN PEACE!!!
He spews lies, that’s his language.  He’s feeling the sanctions big time !!  Let’s get all those yatchs, planes, mansions and bank accounts, all of it. Everything they stole from the Russian people
The hell with Putin! He is a Murderer! He caused so many Death and Destruction, especially to innocent children. I hope that he gets his Karma!
Be like Finland
Ukraine is facing a Hobson's choice! A choice of taking what is available or nothing at all.
✨Good morning✨
when Putin wants to set a condition mean he is loosing the war this crime dictator is very dangerous to world Be careful it does not how many agrement with this dictator it is meaningless when he is stronger same as CHINA
Whichever Russian takes out Putin will be a hero to the world !
So Russia will stop fighting if Ukraine surrenders?
Zelensky, go back to being a comedian. Your forces violated the ceasefire Russia put in place, so citizens could be saved but you fucked that up also. Surrender for the sake of the world. Now the US is sending another comedian Kamala, to go have a look see. OMG, Putin must be spliting his sides laughing. NO NATO and Ukraine must become a buffer zone. Game over.
Arm Ukraine with help and weapon's
Demilitarization will NOT happen.
Good 😁  But I am sure it's a trap...
Don't do it Ukraine! Putin is a liar , why would anyone believe him? In 1996 Ukraine handed over all their nuclear weapons to Russia "in exchange for a guarantee to never to be threatened or invaded".
I’ll start the fight but I’ll stop beating your ass,if you stop defending yourself 😂😂😂 not my president
And the conditions are what? i'm assuming unconditional surrender, and falling under Russian boot, like Belarus. Unacceptable.
Turky wants thier food secure.
Putin is mental he has go check up 😂 his brain has worms in there
India media not trust anymore
Bloody shit ... Agree man what he says. Else will end nukes , space war. Sleepy Biden , wakeup man.
Thank god,🙏🙏🙏
Putin had to do this,just to protect his own people.Westerns are behind this war.
Rot in hell Putin. Ukraine will never surrender.
that Russian sob has not opened corridors to evacuate he has broken that corridors twice now he is not enabling women and babies to leave
YEAH, Putin go to hell in Ukraine!!! Ukraine will never stop fighting if the Russians go away by themselves!!! Victory to Ukraine!!
Liar heartless human🤔 A selfish president
To hell with Putin  and Russia !
OMG!!! Putin hasn’t demanded that Trump be installed as President of Ukraine. Maybe he’s not as crazy as the world believes.
No chance...Ukraine’s are holding Russian forces.
🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽👏👏👏👏
What are the conditions
What are the conditions, duhhhhhhhhhhh?
Don’t trust Putin he is the Lie of lier, he’ll back off and back in again
...what are Moscow's demands?
Turkey wants russia to stop aggressions towards ukraine *(looks at greece)* how ironic
Moscow conditions... ha, big talk. nah bro continue losing equipment. We will not let Russia sleep. many subs are around europe .
NATO has to impose a special no aviate zone over Ukraine.  Something similar to Putin Special operation. 🤔
He shook his and and wiped it.
Please just accept the conditions, we don't want war! Make peace not war!
Request review by House and Senate Republicans and to submit this video to the US Supreme Court. Recommend US GOP engagement with Turkey's President regarding Ukraine-Russian war resolution, peace talks and agreements.
Putins a madman. Starts a war, sets two impossible targets for his straw man enemy to agree to to stop. He forgot he created the straw man and is awaiting its response. 😭😔
🇷🇺 Tu-22 have ☢️ flying over 🇺🇦... 😳 Souces... 🤔
How many times do you have to repeat nothing on this station  ...? ...
So what exactly are the demands? Or are they not public yet?
They better agree to a ceasefire and talk it out. Otherwise there won't be an Ukraine to fight for. My heart goes out to all those innocent people affected by the war.
So,this isn't ending anytime soon is the translation.
No way we wont do that screw off Putin we fight !
I guess no ones knows what Moscows demands are?
Ukrainians will never forgive Russia for what they have done. Senseless, just totally senseless actions.
Putin = lies , he never stops lying. Beware of his new statements. He cold heartedly bombed and still murdering infants in their homes. Beware of such dictators.
Some western politicians, arm industries will be unhappy now
The only condition is Putin to go to the Hague for war crimes!!!
What are this Moscow 's conditions
Is this news just for views or to waste data. We were not told the demands.
Is this news just for views or to waste data. We were not told the demands.
Love from strong people is the answer.
Bomb Moscow!
I don’t believe a word he says
Is this how Budapest memorandum works? Ukraine gave up 3rd largest nuclear arsenal in the world in the exchange for the security guarantees from UK and USA. NO SECURITY  GUARANTEES
Fputin Frussia Fchina
How can you call it "special Russian military operation" when civilians are slaughtered and residential buildings are destroyed, and all of Ukraine! Do the special operation or military exercise in Russia. This is clearly war.
So in summary,  Russian conditions to stop invading: “We will only stop if you surrender unconditionally.”
lol cant trust putin, if he says ceasefire that means he will send more troops and arms
big chance for someone to get the Nobel Peace Prize , STEP UP Tony Blair LOL
Newsflash: The world sets conditions for ending Vlad's reign period!  We hear you knocking but you cannot come in. We do not hear you. We do not listen to you. We do not believe you. We do not care about you. We do not like you. We do not want you. We are so over you. You are nothing. You are a nobody. Zero. Ground your own self down to ground zero and took your best buddies with you! WTG! Not bright! Whoever you have been listening to during isolation, if they helped you down this path should be the one seen as the enemy. You are done with. You are so over, that no one is interested. When you are now Target #1, you should worry. Real attempts will be made for real results! Look forward to it!  Job 1 reflects only one condition. The war ends with Putin out of the way! China!-You're being so helpful, maybe this should fall on you!
The little man must remove his troops and stay home. We now know why the eastern countries join NATO. I used to respect Putting. No more.
Whether he discontinues aggression or not, he has already qualified as candidate of The Hague's International Court---for crimes against humanity!
Basically telling Ukraine to surrender 😂
Did PUTIN ever laugh please ?
What are the bloody conditions please?!
what are the demands then?  how can they stop fighting?? that would be surrender surely??!!
So the same thing they've been saying.. which ukraine refused..?
putin your  end is very near. Russia does not need you
Don't be fooled by a fool. Hidden plan behind it.
What are Moscow's demands - you never stated them
I'm shocked at how well Putin can compose himself, I'm glad he isn't my president
Putin is lying ,,,,,don't trust him how many time he say it but didn't stop the war on Ukraine
Wow really this corrupt criminal is making demands now.What a narcissistic piece of manure.Someone take this piece of shit out once and for all.
You just repeated yourself like 7 times but wtf are the demands!?
Eliminate Putin to save the world
oh no!!! no, no, no!
Whose that putin that wanting whole world take a bow on him???
the negotiations are no negotiations, but hey, there are no ultimatums - Russian version of 21st century intellect
What ate Moscow’s demands?
This political issue should be resolved more humanly through diplomacy. And not sending people to fight one another, It will end out in bloodshed.😔☮️
What are the conditions?
Putin will Stop shelling Ukraine.That must be the condition,not the other way around.
His way or the highway with putin, he does not meet half way in his demands,  and what he wants,.  bully i am afraid and this conflict could last many months if ukraine dont give up.
grab that condition so the world will be on peace the West must swallow their pride to stop this conflict and accept Putin condition
america and NATO will not help they are selfish.
Putin invaded.  The only condition is for Putin to pull everyone back and go home. Putin doesn't get to tell countries around him how things will be done.
We fully understand, love & stand with Russia! Blame U.S/NATO for instigating this conflict.
Ukraina have no friends,just Russia have enemies.
Love you puttin and please follow the peace path
"PRESIDENT PUTIN IS ABSOLUTELY 100 % RIGHT".."VANDE MAATRAM..JAI HIND"
Ukraine will not stop fighting..👈😏 And no conditions for putin..👈😁 From the first day of fighting.. till now..👈😊 How it ends.. Nobody knows..? 😳😳
Thank you lord
LIES  HE SPEAK WITH DARK TONGUE HEED WITH CAUTION
NO! Russia pack your things and get out of Ukraine now! And Putin, you will answer for your war crimes against civilians!
The only condition which will be met is tresemme
Ok, but what are Putin’s demands?
God I hope they accept it. All I want is peace in the world
Bloody Putin not valamir Putin
I believe that Putin just wants a buffer zone between Russia and NATO.  AS I thought through all of this. Zelenski, has been Manipulatinga bit by asking for non Ukrainian volunteers for his Army. If he gets takers the potential exists for Putin to see these men as "official" interference from whatever countries the Mercs call home. This engages other countires ON THE SNEAK, and could be  deemed as leas than honorable.  I believe that Zelenski has been banking on everyone else jumping in , AND THAT'S NOT BEYOND REPROACH EITHER. HE might be gambling long odds.
Sounds more like demands for stopping and full invasion/bombing.... Not really setting any options for dialogue....
Do you think the people are fool ...
What are the conditions?  You failed to name them.  Oh well, nice try
MAKE LOVE ❤️ NOT WAR ✈️ 😌
Putins demands will not be met.
PUSZYSZ SIĘ ŹE WALCZYSZ O TO CO NIGDY NIE BEDZIE TWOJE .'UKRAINA' NIE PODDA SIĘ TOBIE NA PEWNO NIE.!!!!!
Curse the mass murderer 🤮🤮 So called powerful vulture filled with Greed and arrogance Go to hell🤮
That's extortions
Lyes like other russian people . All ar lying
Bro that notconditions based lol. Thats a unconditional surrender on Ukraines behalf with the government being replaced and decapitated.
I HOPE UKRAIN WILL UNDERSTAND THE USA AND WESTERN CONSPIRANCY
Ukraine, tell Putin you agree,  only if Putin repairs all the damage😊😇
And then Putin and his Henchmen get tried for murder.
imagine all the people living life in peace ✌, make love not war!!!
How about telling us what are this domands?
🇷🇺     PEACE  NOT WAR
What a joke! "If Ukraine first stops fighting ... ." You are fighting. They are actually defending.
What I understood was Putin was asked to stop his invasion and he promptly replied no u, fair enough I guess can’t argue with that
Terrible journalism. You didn’t even say what the demands were.
Russia is now a terrorist state, run by a terrorist called Putin, using cluster bombs against civilians.
So it's spewtins way or the highway. Good luck with that.
Good, he isn't as dumb as he seems.
War is on we know but giving misinformaition to the world lead  to more terriorist and all give us appropiariate reson why we should trust your news.dnt make hater news or onlys one news report be from un by sanction all news other then un gov have full authority to rule one government to ask or report
Master Putin
*First Zelensky got his own people in a war were is absolutely NOTHING to win.* *Now that he failed provoking a World War III, what is he going to do??.*
It's not a conflict it's an attack
This is just repetition of what we already know.
Putin be like "stop fighting so i can invade you in peace".
How to be a foreign soldier to help for Ukraine? Im willing to join.. Pls pls pls... God bless... From Philippines with Love..!
Nothing Putin says can be believed
Please Please please God 🙏.. No more war....
RUSSIA WIN uurrrrraaaaaaa NATO have shit 😄😄😄
Murderer!!
The conditions imply that Ukraine must surrender and give-in to all Moscow's demands.
perhaps, if you were a legitimate news source, you would indicate what russia's demands are.
i think Travis Scott can stop this war
Russia wants unconditional surrender
Who does he think he is
so sad when a conflict of "higher ups" affects the lives of the innocent forever.. those people will never be the same.
Crazy condition , No body accepted !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,    1,5 million people  Homeless .  2000 people get kill , 500 children get kill ?????????????????   Stop , moving BACK to Russia , then Talk
The West Greed is the rule of all evil around the world just look at there history. Zelensky doesn't care about us he is a puppet to America and I must say if you guys didn't know he was comedian actor before he became president i guess the joke is on us.
Vladimir Putin visits a primary school one day And he gives a lecture about how great the government is, and how Russia is the best country in the world. At the end of the lecture he invites people to ask questions and one kid stands up and says “Hello my name is Sasha and I have two questions” Putin: “go ahead” Sasha: “Why did Russia sent troops to Ukraine and why did Russia annex Crimea? ” At that moment the bell rang and everyone went to lunch. At the end of lunch the Q&A continued and another kid stood up “My name is boris and I have four questions” Putin: “Yes?” Boris: “Why did Russia sent troops to Ukraine, why did Russia annex Crimea, why was the bell 20 minutes early and where is Sasha?”
Stop invading so that ukrain would stop fighting. The other way around? Insanity
To tell an entire country of people to stop defending themselves while you attack is nothing short of the actions of a terrorist and a bully.  We need to make a show of force as a planet against thugs like Putin, if we do not they will continue this conquest bit by bit until we are all under Russian authoritarian rule.
Blood on the face of the world... Stop the war, please!! Whatever the reasons are!!! NO GO!!!!! Please Mr. President of Russia and Ukraine sit down together to find solutions peacefully. Don't let your people being a VICTIM because of your egoism, ambitious, greedy, mental sickness and your personal interests...UNO should do actual n real actions to stop "Mr. INVASION", not only talking and talking... the dictator should be accused as "criminal war/agitator and bring to the International tribunal".
Ukraine needs to destroy all the Russian war machneries that invaded Ukraine and the international Sanctions to Russia should continue until Putin is deposed or until Russia pays off for all the damages done to Ukraine  with 10 trillion dollars. International community must punish Russia being kept in poverty for the next 100 years.
☮️
Putin is asking for the same things that would avoid the war in the first place
Thanks for helping Israel God bless your country to support of Ukraine people 🇺🇦🇮🇱
Ofcourse there will be conditions
Cease fire should have been before he DESTROYED their COUNTRY... TALKS NOW IS WORTHLESS UKRAINE CONTINUE YOUR DESTINY, OR PERISH... WHAT HAVE YOU LEFT? EXCEPT THE WILL  TO BE FREE FROM PUTIN, AND HIS CRIMINALS CALLED AN ARMY.  THEY ARE TERRORISTS.
What's condition?
What is wrong with the Russian people? They are fighting for a 70 year old wannabe Stalin who wants to go out in a blaze of glory. Nuclear fallout, deliberate or accidental, is inevitable. The existentialist crisis of 20.02.22 affects them as much as anyone else. Only their mad ruler has a bunker stocked up with 10 years worth of food and water.
Repetition on what he already has said since the beginning of the invasion, and then the 1st negotiations and even now. It's basically a surrender from Ukraine, and of course its not going to happen.
The process has started which will end the conflict and send bozo Putin back to Russia.  He finally figured out he is fighting the entire world.  Moreover, his troops are not doing so well because they don't buy into his BS that Ukraine belongs to Russia.  His economy is in ruins.  He has strengthened NATO and set off movement that will diminish Russian sales of hydrocarbons to the west.  In sum, he totally forked it up.
War don’t usually end this quick. It was staged to make impact on fiancial situation.
First lift sanctions , then think only
Maybe the murderer Putin planned the refugee crisis ahead and knew it would be something he can use to blackmail the world?  He might be a murderer.  He might be a madman.  But he is probably not stupid.
& of course this is not Okay for Zelensky. 😏
looks like Putin askes/nicely for turkeys attention 1:17
"if our demands are met"   Yeah, thats terrorism.
It's funny your are destroying a country n asking to halt the depender?
Don't trust putin he said he had no intention of invading ukraine but he did, he's a liar
I just hope Ukraine an the west don't fall for this trick..
Once again, you repeated the same story over again. Trying to extend your YouTube watch times?
Dangerous countries r NATO and USA
The west betrayed Ukraine.
No news there, Their demands are not acceptable to Ukrainians
Putin can NOT be trusted by ANY THING. He lied to French president and lied about the mini ceasefire he promised. Putin conditions is rubbish in my own opinion.
That Man has got to go, that is  me being polite in accordance with YouTube rules
Putin only speaks to turkey to passive them from helping in there own future defense. / Is easier to betray your own eyes???  // How convenient: turkey stands in the way of Syria  🤐🤨😎 /// I got a long rope to drag Putin as long as he wishes; through the mud. "Hope he enjoys the ride/slide if lucky."
This war was all staged
*Putin* "We have a military alliance with China, send weapons to India and use Belarus as a military base" *also Putin* "No one is allowed to join NATO or we will bomb them!"
Even dead Russians are not safe from being cancelled in the west.  Italian journalist Alessandra Bocchi tweeted: "Italy’s main University in Milan just banned teaching Fyodor Dostoevsky because he’s a Russian writer. Dostoevsky was sent to a Siberian labor camp for reading banned books in Tsarist Russia. We are reaching levels of hatred and stupidity that I thought were never possible." Wonder how the woke and the foolish leftists, liberals, and others of their ilk will live this down. The sanctimonious Western media and academia, which never tires of pontificating, is like the emperor without clothes
No, the West shall not agree to aggression (to do so, only rewards more aggression!).
This isn't an invasion or conflict...it's murder!
Wion हिंदी कब आएगा
Putin is loosing.
What are president putins demands?
Zelenksy should give up. because of him Ukraine has been Almost devastated. He has always been best comedian that profession suits him. He doesn't deserve president  post.
They are basically saying if they wave the white flag and surrender russia will stop fighting
Putin must resign as a president of Russia for the war to end. Then dialogue follow, step by step  wen people of Ukraine ad people of Russia Will  meet at the border to negotiate intermarriage continue after it has been suspended with Putin.
Where is West ? Shame on you.. You are not helpless.  You are same guilty as Putin.  History will remember your name. Shameless rich west.  Putin is Bully and understand only one language. Russian people can't do anything to Putin...So, stop impressing Russian people.  Every one has to die oneday. Question is : would you die with honour or with regret.
We need Putin and Erdogan in the octagon. Putin will get spanked
Teşekkür ederim!!
Ok end the war ,,peace right,,,,how about the damage ,,the  deaths of civilian  ,,the collateral damage,,the international law that has been violated,,,no one will be persecuted,😅😅
Nope Zellensky will never agree to Moscow conditions.  It's waste of time.
What are his demands?
This is all a plot to destabilize the EU
Comedian Zelensky is responsible for this mess. Hope he get some wisdom to bring peace. This is not bravery but foolishness to risk entire nation for false ego.
Nonsense.
What are the conditions please?
This war no end.
RUSSIAN SOLDIERS also called as RUSSIAN SLAVES....
Stop frighting
So why didn't you say what the conditions were?
For the sake of ordinary Ukraine civilians. Let the conditions be met🤝
Now you know russia 🇷🇺 mouth is easier than action .time to stop war bring your soldiers back home to their love ones like yours. you hiding them and want them safe but you send other to die putin enough is enough. God be with you putin
Russia go home
Turkey's big mouth is not too open this time. They see Russia means business when seriously offended.
The government of Ukrainia must stop its flirt with NATO. This is a threat on Russia territory. And stop mistreating the Russians of Donbass. Crimea belongs to Russia.
Yeah Ukraine should just give in and end all this unnecessary bloodshed.
Agent Zelensky must back down!
Peace pls. Proverbs 21:1 “The king's heart is in the hand of the LORD, as the rivers of water: He turneth it whithersoever He will.” Psalms 115:3 - But our God is in the heavens: He hath done whatsoever He hath pleased.  Isaiah 14:24 - The LORD of hosts hath sworn, saying, Surely as I have thought, so shall it come to pass; and as I have purposed, so shall it stand:
Russian forces are completely surrounded by 40 million people who are only limited by the amount of equipment the world can supply to them.
Ang dami talagang saw sa wira wala namang Alam.
WHAT A WASTE - THE PROCESS
So no conditions. Like his ceasefire not actually ceasing or his rhetoric of excersise turned invasion. How can anyone trust him at this point. Looks like the sanctions are working.
So NATO need to stop selling weapons to Ukraine an block them from joining NATO
nato and west only good for distroying putin in media and always. give fire with ukrain president
There’s not much news there. What are the demands?
this simply delays the plans that putin has for the glorious reconstruction of the soviet empire. i may settle things for a decade of so but putin, and his cronies, have their plan and they will continue to work on it. as will china with it's 100 year plan.
Bet y'all a 100$ Putin is gonna let em be sitting ducks,then kill them one by one like, man's a walking spewing diarrhea machine...full of bullsh*t!!!
Ukraine Completely destroyed the back to 30 years in terms of economic situation.
whats his demand?
Remove Putin, withdraw Russian forces, reimburse Ukraine for all damages, then we can talk seriously not before.
Thank you Turkish president for trying🙏 just hope Putin is not unreasonable with his demands😥🙏🤗
Yehee the war is indeed... Let's have peace in every country. From Philippines 🇵🇭
Sanctions started burning the bottom and made his mouth open.
Peace ☮️💔😢🙏
What's are the demands?
This is what Modi should have done…rather than robotic statements Indian govt. could have done more. I always hated Erdogan but I appreciate him on what he is trying to accomplish..
Dumbest click bait video I've ever seen.
Plant fruit trees not war
Tell him stick his demands where the sun doesn't shine..🌞 Lol meet his demands 🤣 🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦
what is the f*9king demand
Ukraine will never agree :/ I hope this time he thinks about its civilian. Please stop the war n choose peace.
This is not true
I hope his demands are met. We don't want a nuclear war!
Which will never happen
ukrain president pls accept putin condition for youre people of ukrain dont wait that nato and west are helping ukrain of war with russia all leaders of nato and west are afraid of war with russia god bless ukrain
Another words .... "NOTHING is NEW"
Russia is to agree that Ukraine joins the European union but declares neutrality and agrees never to join the united nations. This is a win for both sides & an end to war. May G-D make both of You listen and agree.
Wion you are total shit. What are the conditions???  Tell proper news
Salute President  Erdogan👏The world is happy and peaceful💛💙
Ukraine are brain washed people , who kill themselves by going against military , Ukraine president is a coward to ask people to fight instead of saving lives of Ukraine people by giving up his own ulterior goals to save his power zelensky using lives of innocent Ukraine civilians as shield against Russian army
*Putin should stop terrorizing Ukraine* 🇺🇦
What are the demands lmaoo?
How can the world watch Ukrainians being slaughtered by a dictator and his ex-KGB military junta? Russian citizens must stop this madman! Russian generals need to top being led by a small man with Napoleonic dreams! NATO must intervene or they will be facing him after he takes Ukraine.
So what are the demands? The video is just a repetition of 'Putin will end the moscow invasion if ukraine stops and demands are met'
Lol is already destroyed Ukraine , not a single Ukraine will accept Russia
Comedian president scratching his head in the corner.. 😂
no ending the  just continue release the nuclear warheads
Can we trust this?
Don't TRUST THIS EVIL MAN NAMED PUTIN!!!!!!!
Putin is terrorist
Botbot Nimo Putin,gustu ko Kita sa tv Nimo unsa Ang patay nga Putin
Hope this goes positive
“Glory to Ukraine” is a nationalist greeting / slogan used by Organization of Ukrainian nationalists, which was full of fascist ideas, which different branches collaborated with Nazi in WW2 and had aspiration to build Nazi-allied totalitarian Ukrainian state.
