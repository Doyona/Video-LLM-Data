Team Pain
Legendary comments about Tim Paine.                                                       👇👇
Ye Australian cricket team ka rahul ghandhi hai😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Ian Healy could back himself up with his wicketkeeper skills & batting by holding his side if needed. Adam Gilchrist - no need for introduction. Tim Paine - no comments.
Think before you speak mr Paine..
and his skills only allow him to talk... yap yap yap yap
Please give captaincy to Warner👍👍 Concentrate more on batting n keeping 👍
See you at Gabba 🤣
Come to Gabba.....for your reckless comment to Our Ashwin, Indian team should have won this series 3 - 1, remember to play humbly throw away your arrogance...
What has the population got to do with your loss???
Tim Paine, just shut up, go inside the men's toilet, have a good cry, go home, lie in bed, suck a pacifier, and go to sleep.  There's always the next day to show off your foul language and racism.
Paine be like:maaro mujhe maaro sab maaroo😂😂😂😂😆😅
You can't do better mate. You did your best. The opposition outplayed you
You more look like a MotoGP racer than a cricketer....
Sounds like thug at his best behaviour at the Police Station sensing dark forebodings. We know what’s beneath that mask.
Bit harsh on paine on trash talk. Tats part of game once there is frustration not able to take wicket. Cheating of smith continues though
Can't wait to see you at BABA KA DHABA 😜😜😜
When they resort to "banter" they know they are loosing.
Gabba...poda Bae
RIP
Tim pain the great Mentor for INDIA 🤣
Once a legend said, come to Gabba 😂And the rest is history 💥
Sledging,  pitch tampering, ball tampering,  Gabbas  history  will not  win you a match mate , to win a match you need steel ones ( B...S ) mate, keep it in mind the next time. You come across Indian  players.
Tim,  Any plans, of. Baby sitting, after, loud mouth, about  Gabba.
Tim is a real Paine in the aus
India in last decade had Shewag and Dravid. Now we have Pujara and Pant.
Me nd my Gully cricket team.. will definitely win...in Aussie....next too we will tour... bcoz Aussie National Team loss with Indian B team... They are able to play with my Gully Team....🙊🙈🙉🤣
Chal Nikal😂😂😂
Paine in pain
Wasnt paines fault. It was duds like warner who must have been paid by india to fail with the bat or he is fucken hopeless. I can score more than him so give me a game...absolute corruption at its best
भगवान आपकी (टिम पेन) आत्मा को शांति दे 🖕🖕😛😛🍼🍼
"Can't wait to see you in Gabba" - Tim Paine
Paine go to Play with ur area kids and prove itself 😂😂😂😂🤣😝🤭
Eriyuthaaa nalla eriyatu 😂😂😂..come to Gabba vamlaa😂😂
We won we r happy but paine is awesome bcz of you mr paine this series is intresting evn last too.... and honestly  u batted well 😊 but enjoyable series
Nice video, keep it up Guys. Ek hor nava song aaya hai JATT FIRE by zaffar & Gurlez Akhtar, lyrics by vicky daliwal and mind blowing model Mahi Sharma. Do watch the video plz...🙏🙏😊
Really a pain in the Auss.
I think Paine got some notes at his top coz he is seeing alwz at his top
2 years before they are excusing of absence of 2 players .... And now india win without their senior players... Actually india c defeat australia a .... 🤣😂😂
Your bowlers targeted body more than wickets 😁
Tumlogo ne Pujara ko out kar ke galti kar di 😂
Paine is filling pain😁
Finally.
Bechare ki shakal dekhar daya aati hai 😂😂😅
Australia has problems at 2, 5 and 6. They need to move on from Wade , Head & Harris and Lyon needs to stop bowling around the wicket and protecting offside field bowling at leg stump to right handers. Paine needs to step down.
Pujara took many hits... But Paine feels the pain...
Never underestimate the opponent. Don't be overconfident.
He wanted to see them at Gabba, now he'll never forget Gabba. Haha
Aur bhai aa gaya swaad😎😎
Guys the credit should also go to Sir Rahul Dravid who has coached many youngsters majority of them were included in Team India. Everyone has played their role and got this result.
Once a skipper said: see u at gabba Legend 😎 replied: come to India that will be ur last test & The rest is 🔥 history..
Stop chirping on the field and stay focused on the game. Body line?? It’s not 1930s get smarter
I spend my most time in '' recording " , gameplay, editing and uploading. I need all my brothers  and  sisters support 💪...Thank you 😭😭🙏
Who else can see pain in paine's eyes!! 😆
Bhailog please don't scold him guys 🙏
Come on SA it’s your opportunity to show AUS that they are not anymore champions in cricket.
you are the reason australia lost. maybe concentrate more on the game rather than your words
*"Paine" but nothing is silent*
This guy, who is the captain of Aussie Test Team wont make it into Indian squad with the meagre talent he possesses.
RIP tim Paine 🤣😂
Who is Will?
Yaad mat dilaya kijiye...  Shubhman gill 21 years old,  Rishabh pant 23 years old... 🤣👆🇮🇳
Meet at gaaba... Soojh gaya gaaba😎😎
Dont troll him he has responsibility to won test against india but not gone his side if virat loss test in india he also started sledging
South Africa karte reh stumps ke peeche hone ki Jajah TV ke peeche beithna ab
Thanks for your contribution for India's win, mate!
Tim Paine....the President Trump of world cricket: Always dropping the ball and making world class gaffes
Temporary captain
Tim Paine debut was with Smith. Smith performed. Paine just never had it! Captain by default. Selectors are useless as well they keep bringing the same selected players through who just haven’t got it like Paine!
There is maturity in his talk. It was a good competitive series. You win some and lose some. All in the game. Good luck for the South African series
Population
Can't wait to see u at the Gabba
Pitch report was spot on, they said in the morning the cracks wouldn't be in okay too much coz they are so big!
😎💪✌🙏💐🇮🇳
Karna hit you hard. Think before you act hereafter.
Paine in pain
Your main bowler staRC , always bowling short off length .. so he is ending with Nil.
Part time skipper  but full time motivational speaker 🖕🖕🖕
Kyu bhai aagaya swaad🤣
His Collars are down after Gabba 😂
Gabba gabba...aya swaad ?😃😃
Flopstar 🔥❤️
Guess u won't need a babysitter now Tim😂😂
You guys lost cause you guys worked hard only on sledging not on game
Last series as captain 😢  Full pain
"Can't wait to get to the Gabba 😉"
Dil chhota mat karo.... No1 test team se hare ho😎
we indians are happy because of u paine
Every time Paine speaks rubbish, India wins the series. Guess his words are blessings.
Expect an aggressive game by australians in next upcoming series they will white wash any team  in coming series   Wounded lion is most dangerous than normal lion   Lion is king of jungle no matter how much duration it sleeps when it wakes up its still a lion itself.
Tim is very much in PAINe
😂😂😂 paine in pain
Tim pain u r A temporary captain....it was ur last match as captain..remember it.... And don't say anything to indian(rishabh pant)....vrna baza farrr denge beta.... Tim pain- we c u in gawa Now Tim pain -GAAR FARRR DIYA RE BABA(RISHAV PANT TERa bap h re mc)
They tried their level best to sledge hurt feelings, injure them, what else. That is the result.
TIM PAIN TO PANTH-VIRAT DON'T LIKE U NOW AUSTRALIA TO TIM PAIN-WE DON'T LIKE U....WE LIKE PANTH
He should be dropped now.
And your skill allows you to drop chances at will ... 😂😂😂😂
Whole Austrelian team right now: Spiderman Spiderman tune churaya dil ka chain. And we know who is the spiderman 😂
WTF population has to do with this win. You literally need to think before you speak. Oz doesn't talk like that. You are in the wrong business mate. You should be in the meme industry. Damn population. Hell l..chinese might be thinking of cricket now. Hehe
Paine is in pain..😄😄
Tim paine is gentleman ,its india who couldn't get his banter ,he never abuse ,always great banter but i think soon ur career will be over, plz focus on game more than banter love u from 🇮🇳
Had you not droped rishabh pant when pant advances for a big shot and couldn't hit the ball, Australia had a good chance to win the trophy, but it was only because of that drop rishabh pant went on fire n wine the series, keep that in mind.
After virat left the team i really worried But they succeeded and won the series❤❤❤👌👌👌
Looser
Powerful pant make powerful jit
Paine after defeat to Ashwin : "I won't come to India this was my last series". Ashwin : pehle Bola kya tha ?
♥️♥️♥️♥️All those who are watching this video I pray , That their parents will live a longer life with good health😊👍❤️❤️❤️

Can you imagine, what was a dream for sachin dravid dhoni Ganguly, are made true by our young under 19 heroes. Many legendary teams couldn't do what India did yesterday at Australia. It is the greatest ever victory in the history of cricket 🙌
India team giving practice before Ashes to Australia and winning.. then will move to England and give practice ...?
Love from Pakistan for team India what a match
Do you still hate Ashwin????. You are a good soul. may be that was a fits.
Tu bol rha tha Ashwin se k mai gaba tak wait nahi kar sakta....ab kya ho gaya...bahut jyada nahi bolna chahiye...tumhe result mil gaya hoga jo tum sledging karne walo ko chahiye tha...aur sledging karo...mark Waugh aur Shane Warne kaha gaye jo Rishabh pant k bolne per bahut comment kr rhe the...spiderman ka song gaate gaate wo series le gaya...
what a win
Don't try to blame the pitch😂. Indian batsman outplayed Aussies bowlers. Old tricks didn't worked out.
O beta ji .. o babu ji.. qismat ki hawa kabhi naram kabhi garam... Jab din kharab chal raha ho na to muh kam chalaya karo
Please stop abusing Tim Paine He is a very humble guy off the field He also plays for his country so he just wants to do anything to win the match for his country THE ASHWIN COMMENT FOR JUST FOR THAT MOMENT BECAUSE HE JUST WANTED TO BREAK ASHWINS CONCENTRATION. PLEASE  DON'T ABUSE HIM.🙏
Once you retire, please come to India mate. You're such a motivational speaker. XD XD
*PAINE IN REAL PAIN*
He is to cocky. We  need a new captain, his words come back to hurt him. Well done india I like the way they play now never give up.
now I am feeling for him  he held the team's captaincy in a  critical phase...........  uplifted the team from there and went on to win the ashes trophy and rebuilded the team......  ca should back him........  aussies..........u are worthy opponents
Before the Gabba test, The Australian Bowling attack had a combined 1013 wickets, Where as the Indian Eleven that played had a combined total of 13 test wickets! (Including Rohit Sharmas)   Australia won every single toss, They were at home and still lost the series 2-1  The problem lies deep in Australian cricket! and it always has to start at the top!

Come to gabbaa
Never messs with india i say never..
well if you pick 11 out of 35 million aussie , then they are also best players of the country. Pretty irrelevant thing to bring that up , the first I am hearing from sportsman.  In that case Culture also matters , india doesn't have a sports culture like Australia does.  So that's not the point , this team showed character,  played well deserves the win.  Appreciate thats it. Pretty lame thing to bring it up by both Langer and paine must have discussed b4 their respective media conferences. :)
Would you like another slice of Humble pie Tim? You've seem to finish that first slice pretty quickly.
Steve Smith is better remember in 2014 2015 india were  242 / 2 to alot around 320 all out Steve is a better captain
Once a man said come to gaba  rest is history
Lets not forget Tim Paine  was a class act after he joined India huddle over abuse in Sydney Test. He is a young captain and will learn from this series. Australia management should not rush to remove him from captaincy. He was given the Job when he was not fully prepared and ready. He is still learning to be a great captain. On field there is always a banter, however he has been gracious in post game interview and accepts defeat with grace. This is maturity. With experience he will be a great captain.
All you were in over confidence Australia. Cost your defeat.
Good bye pain. We don't want to see your face.
End of Tim pain Era.
Finally Gabba became ghabba for Australia
Stave Smith and Warner will be eyeing for captaincy
Well played India, too good.
Don’t think I’ll ever see Tim Paine playing again
Guys please don't blame them.. just 2min silence for them who said India lost 4-0.
Australia team as a thief team in the world

🏆
Paine you are in pain now.
How did you became captain for what reason?? I am still don’t know it yet
Indian Cricket Team killed the fraudssies and abusssies with success and buried them with smile.
Paine "The most painful person on the earth today. "
Feel the pain .😂😂.....Tim paine
Gabba gabba Gabba 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Why would a captain of Australian cricket team say his country lacks talented players?
Shardul Thakur should've been man of the match for 7 wickets and 70+ runs in both the innings. That partnership with Washington in the first innings and giving break through by breaking the opening partnership of Australia in the second innings and he also took couple of catches in the field.
I think he is dignified in admitting areas of improvement and appreciation of Indian performance. We must not stoop down to being judgmental. He is human and he did the best as per his ability. We must remain civil and show true sportsmanship.
ये तो रोने लगा 🧐
PUJARA took the 8 blows n Rishabh had to give back numerous blows to Aussies!! This is KARMA!!😂😂😂😂
I think Paine said those words in Sydney may be to just make Ashwin angry and thus lead into a false shot and lose his wicket, Aussies are really masters in Sledging, I remember McGrath sledging Sachin when he used to bowl at him, sledging is in Aussies blood, you cannot remove sledging from them. Paine I think is slightly nicer than the former Aussie players.
Indian inexperienced young guns destabilised aggressive exp Aussies😂😂...Kudos Youngistan!!
Aggressive ppl are easy prone to get disheartened so easily..best ex- Aussie Players : Ponting, Smith, Tim Paine...unlike Dhoni..
Come on Gaza go garry,your gaba is done tim
Tim Paine is really in PAIN
Paine’s famous last words “Can’t wait to see you at the Gabba Ash”. Pant.. easy Ash! Ash, hold my beer Tim..I won’t be playing but let me introduce you to Washington, Thakur and Nattu mate! They will end your career at the Gabba! Ps: Pant won’t be babysitting your kids tonight... he gonna be celebrating the biggest comebacks of all time!!! Tim Payne, forget about Covid19.. time go for a check up for foot in mouth disease...!
Sorry to say Australia still have not learned the lesson of hubris and assumed superiority will always come back to bite you one day. Karma.
But hey, at least your teammates like you, Paine. You keep leading and playing this way, you can retire to babysit and wouldn't need Rishabh Pant to do it for your kids.
Man of the series should've been Paine for motivating India.
Mujhe nhi pata tha ki koi team sirf ek statement se bhi match har sakti h. Can't wait to see u at gabba😜
BEST  motivational speaker for crickets teams and youngsters 👏👏✊✊😜 yea
i live in sydney and trust me its one of the most racist cities of world. especially against indians they have kinda hidden hatred which popps up from time to time. they just cant digest india achieving anything at the global level, let alone cricket.
“THE TEST” season 2 trailer...
Tim will lost his job
New humming at Gabba... '32 years just waiting for this chance... Aussies... Who hv f*... the Aussies'
Next time when you sledge... look at yourself and your performances first. Bloody hopeless.
Tim Paine and cheater ... couldn't beat/cheat India..
Is it me who notices his breakdown. Doesn't he look like he is about to cry?
Is his last name Paine or Pain 😢 ? I can see Pain in his body language.
We saw you at Gabba.
Australia  NY Tu India Ko 36 Runs  par Out  Kiya Wo Bhul Gaye AP Sab
Aus Best Team Hy
was nice seeing ya at Gabba Mate🤣, love from Ashwin 😍
Paine is simply a Pain and Punt is the match winner, that is the big difference between two teams wrt WK pov
Australian MET dept should be changed for giving wrong weather forecast.  While saying likelihood of game disruption because of rain is strong and not even a drop of rain or loss of play was witnessed.  This is for the weather department.

this man was definitely crying before coming for the conference..
Class, humility, skill and guts. Congratulations to Team India on winning the series (coming to the Gabba also).   Karma for an arrogant and bully Australia team.   - Tim Paine throwing kindergarten sledges   - Steve Smith NOT shadow batting but removing Pants batting mark on purpose   - Matthew Wade pretending to run into Ravi to intimidate and bully him   - Josh Hazlewood bouncing Pujura and hitting him then taunts him with a remark "You didn't see it"
Only tears missing in his interview rest is fine 🤪😂😭
End of your stint as a captain and player Paine. probably your big mouth did it, why do you Aussies  cheat and sledge, by the way Paine are you ready to babysit???? I will give you a fair job offer, but close your trap-
The highlight of this series was the biased commentary on 7. When an Indian player gets out by a poor shot, the Australian bowler is praised, but when it’s the other way round, they don’t praise the Indian bowler, rather they complain that the Australian bats man should be ashamed the way he played. It was just annoying
Never under estimate any one ..today proved
In last match ashwin tell come to india that tour your last match but now I am 100% sure this gaaba match is your last match ,take a long rest good bye 👋
Maybe the solution is for the Aussie cricketers  to spend sometime with the 'panel beaters' as suggested by their commentators to Pujara  !!!
Cheater
Aur bhai kesi lagi , agaya swad
Example of Celebration Too Early for Aussies :P :P :P
Baap se panga le liya sala......
We want India to come to south africa not australia
Ye kuchh der aur bola to ro padega
U expect from cracks off the pitch....we gave a nasty one in yours....
People trolling him and all. Its really tough on him, its brutal but he has to take all the criticism and trolling on chin and move on. He such a nice bloke, you almost feel for him.
10 saal bad apne bachhe ko bolunga..ki ghaba ka ghand tutte hue mene live dekha tha..😂😂5 bje uth kr match dekhi h bc
I don't why I feel for him, he took the captaincy at troubles times and he did tremendous job. He is such a nice bloke.
It's tough for him... The series was a barrage of embarrassing incidents for him... Now he can chatter in the commentary box like Slater the cheater
Your arrogant is the main reason of loose
Guyz enough of pulling him down ....he apologised and admitted his mistakes ....Leave it now....
Cheer up bro,  we don't want  Aussies to lose the fire,
Make steven smith your skipper
I can see those disappointment and tears in Paine 's eyes.
Ye new India he ghar me ghus kr Marta h
T 20 is for Teens ODI is for Men But.. Test Cricket is for legends.
Australia was overconfident that's why they ended up losing side
Feel ashamed of u'll pig faces for the way U'll behaved against our players
No need to troll him as he is the captain of Aus...its a battle between 2 great sides of international cricket ..thats why this  series got this much recognition..players may exchange  words...we dont want to shoulder those...just enjoy the pure class of Test cricket..
Tim tim Tim tim Tim Tara chalti hai kya 9 (2) 11
Thanks for getting our new team members an opportunity to shine thru..we bring out the worst in Australia..you bring out our best..but a great test series for all cricket lovers..
Think about that stumping chance missed... The result may have been otherwise. Hence stop talking & concentrate on the job!
Paine has awarded with lots of pain....never ever can forget gabba... Kyon ki india banadiya gabba ko ek dhaba...... Jis mein paine tha ek continental cook.... Achha laga gaba ki dhaba....
What's with this huge population excuse? Even Langer mentioned it. India always had huge population, this is nothing new. It's not just about skills. New generatiion players have got a different mindset which is very agressive. Nobody in this team had better batting technique than Dravid, Sachin or Laxman. They just play complete fearless cricket now.
your skills only allow you to abuse the opposition u tool because u hide your cricketing incompetencies by hurling abuse. you wouldn't qualify for to carry drinks in some of the state  teams in india .
All pains for Tim Paine!
7 number jersey u wearing it's not lucky ok pain sir
How’s the pain ? 😜
Just a game not war.
Now you can babysit mate
This test series describes about optimisation of skilled players in India team for both test and ODI
Honestly I think he had it enough.. We Indians should stop trolling him because we people are hippocrites too, we trolled and criticised our own team when it got all out on 36.. Pant also received a lot of criticism after dropped catches.
Aussie never learn. They sledge kholi and he scores each time. I actually thought Aussies sort of have learnt this by now.   “Look, the moral of the story is never ever trash talk. First it’s a huge gamble, because the chance of the whole thing go awry is 2:1. And secondly, it’s damn humiliating“ I think there team meeting would be something on those lines. Lol Awesome team India.
Spider man spider man.... Tune churaya mere dil ka chain.. Ho ho..
See u on india Paine,  woohoo
See u in gabba👍🤓
Gaba bana dhaba
Smith should return as captain
Now its your turn. Can't wait to see you in india. It will be your last series
Newton's third law of motion : "For every pujara, there is equal and opposite rishabh pant " 😂

Let's just instead of trolling  appreciate how paine managed to handle the team after sandpaper issue and keeping whole team intact..
Temporary captain 😄
Happy retirement mate...thanks for welcoming us to gabba❤
4:33 Rishabh Pant’s skills
Can't wait to see you in India..... remember, it will be your last series... farewell is ready for you.
I don't know why Indians are suddenly hating Paine. What he did to Ashwin was a one off and he apologized. Other than that,he is always cool and funny with others. I really don't hate him. But guys like Hazlewood, Wade, it's a different story.
Australia: Can’t wait to see in Gabba   India : For a loss after 32 years?
Can somebody please have a word with Mark Waugh 🤣🤣
What about "see you at gaba" ?😀😀😂
Is he the captian of australia,!!!🤣
Rishab pant is main hero for historic win
You should play a series against no 5 or below to get it balanced..
Mr Paine your memes are going to be popular until another Aus captain sledge 😂😂 btw was it your last test? Just asking
Gabba 😂😂😂
Here is a simple method for Aussies to win all matches on home turf. Make the batsman  Steve Smith an umpire. He does all the cheating tricks for u guys.
Can't wait to see u guys in India..Belive me i will occupy seat near boundary and show u guys the real taste of sleding behind boundary.. Really can't wait
Come to India sir...we have some more gifts for u
Man no need to dislike this video the dislikes does not go to Tim Paine!
Just look at his face when he said population is the only game.🤣🤣
Although he acted like a d*** in sydney but i still admire how he stood up for aussies after sandpaper scandal. In the end,it's all about competitiveness and we witnessed huge amount of it.
How is gabba baby i know it's tooooooo pain😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 Give some rest to your mouth 😁
Its okay guys. Let's not troll him . Let's praise them as well. For reviving test cricket.
What you are speaking after losing match supper👍👍👌👌😀😀
India wins❤️🔥, Patt Cummins 💓💓
When they have nothing to coverup the defeat then they are just left to say that Population is the only game.😂😂
Tim I have give you best advice speak less work more
There's so much pain.
Kepachoda captain and tar khepamor moto decision...1st 3rd test a declaration date and last test match a batting order ta....as a captain kono run nei....team a chance ache....ki lobby sala😂😂..Aus cricket board hai hai😂
he looks like he is almost gonna cry ... Never underestimate anyone
Tape ur mouth
Ohh!! Can you feel pain behind his eyes & in his voice
The worst part for aussie defeat is they lost against India's team which was not even 100%  Congratulations India for wonderful win  Hard to imagine what will happen to Australia when they visit india  I think Indian spinners will roast them alive 🤣🤣🤣
Yah we can feel the pain
Talent and character .. Talent ok  But your character is a dust bin
O Tim Paine ,,, we can see real pain on your face 😔🤣
I think his career  is over. He missed a lot of catches and stumpings.  Most of his drs review went in vain. It is better if we dont talk  about his batting.
And.....we'll get you guys anywhere anytime  - Indian team
I fail to understand why he is being trolled this badly. He didnt make any personal remarks, he simply sledged on field about the game, something which our players have been known to do as well. They lost and his performance behind the stumps in the third test is up for scrutiny but still how is it justified to insult a human so extensively. If the intent is to "get back" at him then hasn't that motive already been met? How is anyone who abuses him and his family any better? If anything, they are worse since what he said was on field in the game, what the rest are doing in response from behind keyboards is blatant hate mongering.  This is so pathetic on our part ki kya kahu bhai.
MORAL OF THE STORY : NEVER MESS WITH INDIANS 😎😎😎😎
Paine : Can't wait to see u at Gabba Gill & Pant : We can't wait too
Loudmouth Paine ur banter was the prime stuff why we r most jubilant to beat the hell out of u
I understand your PAINe.....
Why would they doubt Paine captaincy' ?? The defeat was not by a big margin infact was a very close contest. It's not an issue of Paines incompetency, it's India at its best.
SEE YOU AT THE GABBA MATE  :P
Improve your attitude and your game might improve
All are correct😉😉😉😉 But paine is mainly the reason for the defeat of Australia in these series😁😁😁😁😁💙💙💙
Pujara's image might gonna hurt Australian a long time
When players are being controlled by backstage officials they can't play with natural instinct. After sandpapergate Aus cricket board thinks it's good to be called as nice team than winning team. When Paine was asked to apologize for his Sydney behaviour, consider his motivational level? Australia is known for sledging and by sledging they torment opposition concentration and got wins. This what happens if we put lion in a cage. This is not usual Ind vs aus tour. It's good but not best.
u know this was ur last series?? hahahahhahahhah
Can not understand his most words because of his accent😣
OHHH BETA JI.. kismat ki hawa kabhi garam, kabhi naram  Kabhi garam garam kabhi naram naram Kabhi garam naram garam naram  Gao bsdiwalo... 😝😂🤣
Australians have exhausted all their luck in Adelaide.
I have never seen the Australian keepers that missed these many stumping, catches. But Paine. He is mentally not fit it seems. I think he feels the captaincy pressure. Australian Cricket board should think about the captaincy change very soon.
Lolu captain of Aus.. not much international cricket experience..not much record ..still a captain cause he is coach's favourite. Lol
Now Paine and all aussie team: mere to L lag gaye.
Team australia beaten to dust by their own ego.
Who remember Virat interview in similar condition after loosing Adelaide  test. He was in tears too.
Pain should be thrown out of Australia team
Sundar , Pant , Thakur , Natarajan, Gill came from 'out of syllabus'. 🔥His threat to Ashwin for the Gabba test backfired.🎉
Tim paine u nice guy.. Everyone  has bad day.. I'm sry for it...
If Tim stay captain then he speak I don’t think he speak after that specially against indian because indian doesn’t give to second chance to anyone he doesn’t have a think box in his brain after he lost the series for sure
old proverb=No pain no gain  but Australia is in pain because they have Paine.
He is not at all a good sportsperson. No human nature at all
I used to have high opinion for Paine ahead of this series, he held the reigns of a side that was morally down, lost respect in the cricketing world. I felt he was doing a great job as a captain and player, even in the last test series, in Australia, his cheeky banter with Pant was entertaining (baby sitting one). But after this series my opinion for Paine has dropped quite alot. Expected a better show of character from Aussie skipper.

Worst Australian Test Captain in the last 30 years, and he should shut the FUCK up, as he can never walk the talk...Time to make that change CA.
Paine : This world shall know pain. Pujara : Earth style, mud wall
now care about your captaincy and career not ashwins career
Tim paine is a good captain and leader.. One of the best keepers in business too . But bad at speaking, that's it.. As an Indian proud of our victory..❤️ But 4 Australian bowlers continuously played 4 test matches... kudos to them🔥
Sachin n Dhoni always given their replies thro t bat only, not bi words! Same has been followed bi our boys!
PAINE IN THE ASS.. next time, please think before you speak
My words for Tim Paine Don't be too worried.winning and losing is a part of game.sometimes we win,sometimes we lose.dont be too disappointed and practice well for the next series👍👍👍
Mr. Paine...... Sorry to say dat "WE GOT U @ GABBA..... 😂🤣😂🤣💪💪🔥💪💪"
Mu ❤️de ke jaisa hogaya bichare ka piane get s lots of pain😂
It's official that Paine is part of the History as well.
love to see it.. chat shit, get banged.. mate
I was expecting Paine to give retirement speech..but i was wrong.
Bandarpani ka kya hal hua is team pane ka yad rakho team pane sabse aage hindustani
Aur lo ashwin sir se panga😂😂
As an Indian still love the allround effort from both team.... Aussies fight well, but India won the crucial moments..... Cummins ♥️♥️... What a bowler he is???!!! Thanks for both squads, team management, support staff, Cricket Australia,BCCI... For a wonderful series.....
Fun Fact 2018 test: Strong India  vs Australia without Smith and Warner. 2021 test: Young India  vs Australia with all their players.
Think before ink 😀😀😀long back some wise man said ..
BIGMOUTH PAINE!!!
Mitchell Starc cannot swing the ball without the artificial shine created by sandpaper. Back when Sandpaper gate happened, Stuart Broad said that, during Ashes, Starc swinged the ball at times when conditions were not even in the favor of it. Now Sandpaper is out of equation, he is pretty useless.
Tim paine.. will we see him again against India.. dont think so...
India played only one bad inning. They were all over in spite of team injuries. If could have managed well that one inning who knows India would have won 4-0
Enough pls now don't laugh on tim. He is also a good player anyways very Happy that India won and now people should enjoy our victory and should not troll this guy 😊
Ashwin told paine " cant wait to see you in india that will be your last series" i think this is tim paine last series 😂😂😂😂
yeah you missed his stumping chance!  You should step down!
We need an Aussies vs India series every 2 years like ASHES. This is the new rivalry!
Australia would be crying why it didn't rain today😂😂 Lol
Now I feel sorry for him🙏🙏🙏
Tim Paine ur mind was busy in abusing  Indian cricketers that's why u guys got defeated.
Tim paine kuch b kaha ho...lekin respect karo..ye khel hai ...harne walo ki aur jeetne walo ka b samman hona chahiye...from punekar
saari akkad nikal gayiiiiii kiya....bola tha sher ko mat jagaoooo
Aus fans don't get offended just imagine that what Indians had to go through when he told that statement to Ashwin. Bharteeya se takraya samjo choor ka choor choor ho jayega.
End of Tim Paine Career
Its sad to see Tim Paine being so sad. He is very uncertain about his future in the Australian side leave alone captaincy. He actually played pretty well in this series but somewhere they lost the rhythm.  In todays match both Gill and Pant deserved to share the Player of Match. For if it was not bcos aof a solid start from Gill with a good strike rate , India would have abandoned their desire to play for a win.
If you are waiting for the pitch to win you a test match, the pitch will support theyopposition
Win or loss is part of game mate but you guys played with lot of heart and give us some nightmare fortunately somehow we manage to snatch win but you guys are fab and best of luck for future and respect you ausie fromm india👍👍👍
India ended his career way before he reached India 😂😂
I think we can stop trolling or abusing him
Then: Welcome to Gabba , Singham 😎 Now: Cheating , cheating, cheating  hai ye 😭
The sport of cricket won by a huge margin today.  It will live on for many generations.  There were assumptions made by the home team that gave them a false sense of security, and that is what they paid for (and with).  I hope they come back strong.  India got resoundingly thumped by NZ in the 2020 tests, and this is their rebound with completely inexperienced test players.  They must not drop their concentration in England.  Meanwhile, I will be basking in a historic win. Cheers.
The mistake of Australia , they should have had yorkers in the mix
Common, shut your mouth n play cricket.
can't wait to beat you in gabba
Paine has played his last test as a player n captain too. Aussies have learnt a hard lesson n I think they will not take this defeat head down. Starc, Paine, Wade on their way out.
India India 🇮🇳🇮🇳
I reckon paine is in career crisis after this loss against young India team.
Indian s    powar chusara  be rechagodite tattukoleru ra  bacha
Don't worry mate is part of game win or lose. We played cricket then u guys. Tx for putting gr8 show. Al da best. Love frm India. Cheers to life. .
Can't wait to see you at  gabba Team ind:- can't wait for this interview 😂
Paine's situation reminds me of Captain Russell of LAGAAN
Remove Kohli paine
Say ❤️❤️Salute to indians.. shutup u r mouth..say india is great..
The most important question is : When is the season 2 of The Test coming ? Hopefully u guys will show great acting skills like u did in the first  😂😂😂
Tim paine to ashwin- can't wait to see u at the Gabba boi Today- bhaiya meri jaban toot gai glti ho gai maaf kr doooo  Haye mai mat gaya aaaa 😂😂😂😂😂
Legends say he is still waiting for Ashwin
I feel for Tim paine😭😭😭
2:45 So they have skillful players because they have got a huge population and lot of skillful players to choose from? I mean, seriously? How much non-sense this man can spit out? Really? By this logic,  I can't imagine to think how difficult it must have been for Australia to even build a cricket team with such a small population. And What the hell is China doing till now? They should have been all time greatest cricket team by now.   Grow up Tim. Do you even think before you talk all such bull*hit? Anyone can build a team, but YOU first need to build a character. That would be a good start for most Australian players.
Why this guy is still the captain of Australia? Is this the best they have to lead the team? Failure after failure but still the Captain???
Crying inside.
Slipper shot to aussie
Shame worm, Tim Tim pani, sandpaper scrubber, lawdushane, Nylon, Cumming,green chili,hajilvade,normal vade, Racist lawdus All are crying today.
Kon kaha thaa tum se ki udta huwa teer apni gaand me lelo aab acha huwa na benstoke 😂😂
Ye wahi hai bhosdi wala chacha 😂😂
Feeling bad for paine,but india earned its spot,feeling proud indian army🇮🇳
This could be Paine's last test match. Give him a proper send off. Na na na na  Na na na na  Hey hey hey Good bye
''Karma is a bitch''
Nice gazaa 😂😂
Best of luck to your next series we won the series doesn't mean we have the right to disrespect a player or the Team we celebrate our Victory
Paine - See You at GABBA mate Ashwin - Come to India, it will be your last series 😂 Pant & Pujara - We Can't wait till he will come to india , will do it  here only  Paine- ohh bhai maro mujhe maro😂😂😂😂
Even China has big population, funny thing is that they don't have a lot of cricketers to chose from. It is pitiful on the Aussie coach and captain to talk about the population ratio when they lose. Back in the 90s and 00s was Australia brimming with people? They still got talented cricketers into the foray. A lot of credit to the junior program of India A, U19, U16, U14 cricket and NCA for grooming generations of cricketers so that talent pipeline doesn't dry up.
Looks like someone has cried his heart out😂
Ben Stokes 😂😂😂😂
Taking nothing away from India’s performance it was unbelievable. But Paine is done. His captaincy has always had question marks with his ordinary tactics. But he got found out big time this series with terrible fields and no game plan just relying on his bowlers. Not to mention his keeping cost Australia the 3rd and 4th tests in key moments. Why do the media let this slide I don’t know 🤷‍♂️
A bunch of rookies breach the Gabba fortress
Aussies crowd made racist remarks on indian players cap paine said can't wait to see you at gabba in previous match and team india decided to shut their mouth by showing amazing skills on the field.. Team india have won hearts
Do you remember what you had said to Ashwin in the 3rd test 😂
*Temporary captain* has to go now. He's literally a burden for Aussies. They must take harsh decision.
Fear of loosing captency looks on the face
It was an amazing series from both the bowling attacks , Marnus & Smith did the bulk of scoring, Australia's fortress ground is broken.
Practice what you preach😄
Its about India playing just great cricket  not about  Australia underperforming!! Sometimes its good to just credit the winners!!!
I think Aussie played good cricket. It's Bharat that's punch above their weight. They negotiate Nathon Lyon very well. And played Mitchell Starc very well 🙏
Jessi karni wessi bharni   inkey sath easey hi  hona thha   koi b  kisi b  field mey ager dusron ko insan nahi samjega  bhagwaan easey hi  thapped  marta hai  jesse  ausis  ko paddey
I say this again Temporary captain
Cut him some slack tbh
Don't lose hope Timmy you still a great captain, can't win everything plus India planned & played better
Indian team humbled Australian players 😅
Temporary Accidental Ex-Captain of Australia - Tim "Loudmouth" Paine.
Paine'full strokes from Gill & Pant Most Entertaining comments are available here🤣😂🤣😂
L@wde Ka Gabba
Big hand to australian bowlers too they bowl their ass off...🔥🔥 Great test 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 INDIA...INDIA...INDIA....INDIA... if australians were not that good this would not be a great victory to us... Cheers guys...🙏
He is good boy
Okay but the question who will be the captain of Australia now :))
You were exited to play in Gabba.
This might be his last interview as a captain.. dropping lot of catches and doing absolutely nothing.. Take care buddy and all the best for your future endeavours 😀
Tim paine:come to gabba  Ashwin:come to india  Tim paine: dickhead . Now dickhead team Australia
We hope u still in gabba pain for this 🏆
Tim paine to pant::sun raha hai Na tu ro raha hu main😂😂😂😂😂
I feel for paine he is not absolutely best when he become a captain lots of thing going on in that series he have lots of pressure he have best bowler but our india team out class him but in Australia he feel lots of criticism but they have to admit they are best but out team is unbelievable
Tim paine : come to Gabba Indian squad : you should be very careful with what you ask for...
Don't get sucked into stupid comments and kiddish statements. I watched the full 5th day. Australia bowling line up is really the best. They are so precise, disciplined, aggressive, skilful it's almost like clockwork, Australia did the best they could so this makes the achievement even better. Those batsmen were literally fighting a war. Pujara will not get much limelight ever but he was such a soldier for India. If he had got out it would have been over because of how good the bowling was and yes after he got out 3 wickets fell fast. Look Australia play and talk the way they do, it's an international game, credit to them for making it very hard and really giving their best, all the bowlers really toiled, their intensity and determination on them is top-notch, But, in the end, the bench of India overcame that, let's celebrate it and not call the Aussies stupid names because they gave us the best bowling in the world.
i feel depressed watching this! I hope he recovers from this and lead with intent
if only yous stop sledging and start playing. lol cant wait for you lot to tour India, but you dont have to worry, you'd be fired by then.
Population is not an excuse. Most of the Indians do not play cricket professionally.
Wanker of a captain ! Not good enough to lead Australia.
Every Aussie is a gentlemen after losing. Before, Racism taunts and everything is Kosher. Learn to eat a humble pie Aussies.
Incredibly superb performance by the Team India especially by the debutant. So interesting to watch on the final day that it overtook the spirits of watching T20 games. All our ace old cricketers should come out to congratulate this Indian team. Jai Bharath, Jai Hind.
Justin langer : Never ever underestimate Indians 🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳 Bhai indian hain ghr m ghus k marte hain
YE TO RO RAHA HAI😭😭
Tim Paine : Can't wait to get you to Gabba  Rishabh Pant : And I took that personally
I think ashwins sledging is absultly right .that this or if australia came to india and losses then that could be his last series as captain😅😅😅
Kinda feel sad for him.
And you have skills only to run your mouth 🤣🤣🤣. Get ready to lose your captaincy
Mr. Paine, what a pain we felt when you bundled us for 36.
Blah blah..Excuses..India bowled well on day 4 then they did on day 5..And he says the pitch didnt have that much🤣
Here onwards concentrate on your game rather sledging the opposition.....😂😂😂😂😂
Bhai nya captain dekh lo ab na to ye bating kar rha na hi wicketkeeper hai
No matter how big player virat kohli is, but he should resign from captaincy. Kohli captaincy is unlucky for India and for Rcb. Rahane or Rohit should lead this team
"Banter" ....lol...🤫
gabba gabba gabba ....... gabbatoir gone ...lol
Well Ashwin was wrong, this was the last series for paine
Australia is a tough side and no doubt boast off the greatest bowling line up ...well fought Indians..great victory ✌
Looks like his career over let's see how cricket Australia backs him or not
ME: what happened in Gabba, paine? Paine: Gabba is captured by Gabbar Pant...
you talk to much ...
Gabba aao bey...  Thk u bhai❤️. Badiya tha. Abhi kahan chalna hai?
Well they didn't play bad But we played better
Both Paine and Langer are saying that there are so much population in India. Toh bsdk humne mana kiya h bacha paida karne se.
You talk less and do more.. your bowlers bowled body line to our batsman ..specially to Pujara..  I have no respect for Australian players .. I absolutely enjoyed the match today.. way to go India..looking to win a test series in SA!! :)
feeling sad for Tim pane ...
This is what happens when you trust your mouth more than your talent. Well if there's any.
Rishab Pant  typical Delhi toughness..Like Sehwag, Gambhir, Virat..Well Played..
Pant's heroics can be compared to Stokes at the Headingley!!!!!!
And Michael Vaughan said earlier that India will lose 4-0🤣🤣 This shows how unpredictable this game is!
Worst captain in world. He doesn't know how to win the match. Tim pain like a dead body player
India just lost that one session where they got bowled out for 36 in the 1st test. Other than that they won all because they read and managed well all the remaining sessions of all the tests. Each experience has toughened the young injury filled team. If you go to see it is really a B Indian team.
I actually feel for him. The pride and the fortress that the aussies and their former captains protected for almost 33 years has been lost under his captaincy. He ll be absolutely destroyed.
Shastri has lost his mind rather than giving credit to rahane giving it to kholi who left the team when team lost badly. Rahane stand tall and regroup the team and as a great captain with the available resources he generated immense performance .Hats off to my humble captain Rahane 🙏😀
Salo bahut garur kar rahe the. Hamare sherone bahut mara sale chu***
बहुत भोंक रहा था पिछले टेस्ट में...... अब क्या हुआ बोल नही फुट रहे हैं🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Sidharth shukla
Conquered Gabba...... No Kohli, No Bumrah yet we made reel down...
Hope u dont step down as test captain, i wanna see u facing India in India in test series as captain....
Bye bye 👋 now go baby sit in now that your captaincy is over 🤣
Tell your papa Ricky ponting- don't make shitty comments on India before the match
Paine dropped few catches in last test.. That ended in draw.. Today he missed stumping of pant and that cost the game... There is no fault of his bowler s.. They created enough chances.. Also batting department failed except Marcus and smith..
Aur bhai kaisi lagi aa gaya swad
Let’s be magnanimous in our victory! No need to be nasty! After all it’s just a game!
This defeat teaches Australian team that they should not be proudy,arrogant and selfish they were playing with 13 players but still courageous,brave and mentally strong Indian players gave them hard times  and brought them to mats
Vande matram
You are good cricketer but not a good captain  You loose your head which is not a good to lead a team you let your mouth not your brain Nd gloves Nd bat
Ro kyu rha hi ye
lol they deserved it.
India retained the trophy by 2-1 by historic win in Brisbane. Congratulations to Indian team. You made us proud to be an Indian. Congratulations Rishabh Pant for playing match winning unbeaten test innings on 5th day pitch in Brisbane to score a mammoth total of 328.
Happy retirement as captain @tdpaine36
Crying
Tim . Listen please . This is a new and rising India . A young breed that cares two hoots for anybody's reputation . Ever thought there are dozen of Pants and Sirajs waiting  on the wings to hop in . Just heard BCCI has extended the paternity leave of Virat Kholi so he can better babysit his new production . Hereon , for all Indian Test Cricketers Skype or Zoom will do . How do you fit in Ashwin or Vihari now in the team ? Cheers !
Still he is not in his sences. Still in shock. Don't know what to say.
Tim Paine today head paine
I think that tim paine played his last match for Australia.... he terribly failed as captain and player.... and even starc also didnt performed well... ca should appoint smith or marnus labschane as their test captain
We don't need Kholi to win games........... We don't need his verbal to show our  Power.
In previous test match ashwin was wrong....gabba test is the last test match for hin
We will see you at Gaba,  Once a man said ,and rest is history
Bahut gabba gabba kar rahe the, tum logok liye to hamari India A team hi kaafi thi🤣🤣
keeping aside the trolls and all...have to admit...this was the best test series where both sides gave their best! ind aus always a series to watch!! congrats to india and best of luck to both the teams for wtc final...want ind v aus in final as well🔥
I think after this match your captaincy and your career are on the table
See You Team Australia in FINALE of Test championship Trophy. Come back stronger, we love to play against tough teams.👍
Everything apart, i would say Tim Paine is actually a handsome man.  he has a potential to become an actor look- wise...
Team India has shown you the (ground) reality. Come out of your superiority complex - in both of your speech & attitude. The sooner the better. And this applies to your other team mates as well.
As a cricketer one should show respect to opposition. Uncalled for conversion with R. Ashwin.
They literally got defeated by a India A side
The Aussies got Tewatiyad.
Paine's time is over as a captain
why are they keep raising our huge population... its so rude and irresponsible
Be Humble and respect the opponent and see the difference....
Kohli ka Captaincy hota 4~0 se harte hum😂😂
Paine : Come to Gabba Pant : Apart from babysitting I also hit ball well. Well enough to shatter kangaroos' ego.
Today I got the feeling of wining the world cup
PUJARA,RISHAB PANT, ,AJINKYA RAHANE,ASHWIN,JADEJA,SHUBHAM GILL,WASAHINGTONE SUNDER,SIRAJ,WELL PLAED
Don't forget this guy's contribution , Appreciate him for motivating Indian players by his words
Are you still waiting at Gabba?
Australia 🇦🇺 all  😭😭😭
Gabba is painful.
So much pain in the eyes of Paine 😪
EXCESSIVE EGO CAUSES THE FALL....INDIA WELLDONE...CRICKET IS GENTLEMAN GAME...REMEMBER IT...
TIM PAIN LEADER SHIP NOT UP TO MARK  YOU TALK TOO MUCH THAS ALL YOU CAN DO
Shakal dekho inki 😭😭😭😂😂
Come to India that will be your last series 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Aus will never agree..  You didn't underestimate, underestimate is for underdogs..  Ind clearly ahead in each and every game in entire tour..
Ind ind ind ...
Bolne de bechare ko taklif huye hai. Spider-Man Spider-Man 😂😂😁
Kyu bhai...kaisi lgi...😂 Aagya swaad...???😂😂😂
Its a real shame for the Aussies. They couldn't take all the 10 wickets on a day 5 pitch while the Indian bowling attack with experience of 9 matches in total could do it!!!!!!
Stop telling about wickets. You are saying that u can't win the match if wicket is not doing tricks? What would have been happened then if india would have won all 4 tosses??
Credit to Aussie fans, they racially abused us and our players played with more determination and anger, hence we would have won in any situation against any country.
Aussies are always like gully cricketers (won't accept run outs, won't respect umpire decision) will do everything other than playing in genuine way
Tim Paine: can't wait to Invite Indian 🤣🤣😁😋😁😃😉😃😁  Australian fans: Abbey Sale 😎😎😎
He looks tired hard luck Tim!
They outplayed us...  I don't think we took them lightly They are a very proud cricket country Yeah they they played bloody well! - Tim in Paine
Aussies tried to bowl on the body of indian batsmen rather than to bowl towards the stumps.
Such a Paine in the Aus
Can't wait to gabba😒😒😒😒😒
@Tim, How about baby sitting?  Better concentrate on that at least
Paine is on the verge of crying.....
Indian's Always be 🦁 not 🦘!!🙏🇮🇳💥
Next time? There won't be a next time for this big Paine in the AUS!
Feeling bad as he looks shattered, but he kinda asked for it with his poor behaviour with Ashwin...better keep the sledges for lesser teams imo
He proved today again, he is just an accidental captain. There are many options to use to get Indians batsman out but he failed. He just played player role simply and called at toss that's it. Give Captaincy to Marnus for three years and see.
His eyes are full of pain.
Tim paine out Aus teem captan sa v out hoga abb coash v out hoga abb Aus teem ka..
Team in Pain with Tim Paine's captaincy.
4:34 who called Rishab a fat?
Indian team has wiped off the scar of 36 all out and also has put a scar on the Aussies. Well done team India. We are always there to support you no matter what
Good job👏💯👍 india🇮🇳
gattigaaa paddadii yedava kii... .
Tim your team fought hard, don't cry man, this things happen in sports
Kis kis ko tim pain ki sakal achchi nahi lagti?
See u at the Capetown
Tim spoke well in defeat..
Your title should be  converted to Pain
Muje ashwin ki bat yaad aa rahi he jo Tim pain ko boli thi   Next India tour pe Tim pain ab nahi aayege captainship se wo resign dege   Phir retirement
Poor man ,v feel for u but watch out out bantering
Tim Paine in very much paine 🙄🙄🙄
See u at gabba😂😂
Today's dinner menu:  Tim paine kangaroo dum briyani - Halal special, Wade panda curry,  Hazlewood-lyon kangaroo roast, Starc-cummins giraffe roast,  Labuschagne-smith koala curry, Warne-ponting Emu soup Mark,Clarke, McGrath pudding 😂😂  best served from  Gabba Brisbane.. 😂 Restaurant Tag line : " Can't wait to get you to Gabba" 😂😂  enjoy Indians and rest of the world
Don't cry Paine
inki sledging inko bohot bhaari pad rahi hai. it's high time ki tum sudhar jaao australia waalo.  apna muh band rakha karo field pe. zaroorat se zyada bologe toh maar bhi utni hi tagdi khaaoge😂😂
we need caption to understand . kayoki iske muh me supari hai😂🤣😂🤣
can't wait to see you at gabba
From now Aussies can't use 😂  Gabba
Tim paine is a nice captain don't blame him for this defeat
hello tim pain tell me about your pain how that is ?
TIM PAINE TO ASH:YOU COME TO GABBA ITS OUR FORT  BUT TODAY PANT TO PAINE:ALL AREA IN AUS IS MY FORT.. ASH  TO PAINE :SEE YOU NEXT YEAR
There is no usequse i have not Smith and  Warner one thing always be remembered  tim  paine you naver be mind for sledge  I think this is your last test match
This was his last match as Captain.. sunke pain hua..
Eyes is red 😭
Australia: Last series we don't have Smith & Warner, So you won ! India: Okay, We will send Kohli back this time. Australia: Nah bro India: Okay, 11 of our players will be injured ! Australia: Nah bro India: Okay, We will send our net bowlers in last match Australia: Okay, We will see you at Gabba  Meanwhile India: Hehehe 💥💥💥💥
It will be brutal only if you take the things granted 😂
Why he crying ? It is just a game..❤️ from india. This is our culture to ❤️ all...🙏🏼
We would have taken ODIs too if we had Rohit but still T20 and TESTs are fine for now😍
His wicketkeeping was the difference between India winning the series and Australia winning the series. Respect!!!
Man just admit that you are no where near a good captain of Australia and your team even with good players was nowhere near indian newbies because of lack of pressure applied,it takes tactics to beat this lion hearted team man and not to mention 90% of our team was the ones playing test for India for 1st or 2nd test and if we played with our fully fit team it would have been 3-1😂
Future champions of India
Relying on a deteriorating pitch as oppose to the skill of your bowlers. Come on skipper. Well played team India
Good keeping mate
Australia lost due to 1 Tim paine ( Playing with mouth) 2 Shane Warne , Ricky ponting, Michael Clarke, Michael Vaughan ( for playing mind games, they put their players in overconfidence)
గబ్బ లో  నువ్వు గబ్బుగాడివి అని  తేలిపోయింది...హా..హా హా..హ.
Looks like Tim Paine cried rivers before the interview
He'll retire...
Pant is no more only baby sitter.
A Baby sitter destroyed whole Aussies winning hope😁😁😁
Tim paine 's eyes looked like he CRIED or was BEATEN by the COACHING STAFF for loosing the game...🤣🤣🤣 TIM(e) for some PAIN(e) Killers!!!! 🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂👌👌👏👏👏👏
Paine bowled from one bowler regularly but i think he should change the bowler after 16 overs
Pant and ashwin be like  Ab bol. Ab bol na m**************
Next time when you score more than Ashwin in tests.. Then talk.
I will say He's one of the best Australian Captain . Can't blame him coz They have 130 and 100 overs respectively Bowlers didn't done the Job at their home on Day 5. Drop catches don't matter coz India dropped equally or more to same what they did but they were able to take all Australian wickets with inexperience in away test . Aus Bowlers with experience didn't Bowled well enough . Paine batted superbly as a no 7 batter .
"Team pain"
Don't mock your opponent after the game. It was a really tough series after 2005 ashes.
Well done  & Super effort .. Ricky Ponting team use to win matches like this ! Now it’s Virat & New India .. Gabba taken over by Indians
Don't provoke Indian boy's 😁😁
Paine: "can't wait to see you in Gabba Pant:  haa chotuu aur Bata!!! ** Ispiderman ispiderman playing in the background**
Thread of Unity in leadership under Ajinkya Rahane.
I am Indians ✊✊✊✊Australia 😛😛😛😛
Legendary words by Tim : “can’t wait to get you to Gabba”  after that result 2-1  “Do you baby sit?” After that Result 2-1
Don't sledge now guys ...what had happend in pitch is happened ..and they lost ..now stop..
Pain got real pain😂😂
Career finished
I had a lot of respect for Tim Paine. I even enjoyed his banter in 2018 series. But he is downright disrespectful under pressure. This win feels so sweet to me because of the faces Paine and Wade made on losing
U r just a kid Paine it's time to drink milk go ahead 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
cogratulations team india..
Pujara took the hit on his body and Tim Paine is in “pain” very unreal.
now Michael clarke should celebrate for complete year as said before series..
ABBA  DABBA  GABBA.
Paine and Co .. ,Vaughan ,Clarke ,Punter ....... Got Trashed away with their knowledge Vs Ind Z
ഒന്ന് പൊട്ടി കരഞ്ഞൂടെ 😂
13 vs 1300 test scalps n who wins?
I feel very sad for Tim Paine.😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭  He is always going to be my Inspiration and Greatest ever Captain to me.  Let's hope he Gets rid of all his Depression.  Bless you Painey.....    Don't worry Tim Paine.  Let's hope Australia beats India next time in the Border Gavaskar test series
Ashwin should have realised even this might be Paine’s last series before making that remark of Paine coming to India 😂
Lesson for Australia   from this series , Please accept the fact that India is way more stronger than  you imagine, Never be arrogant, Focus on the real job rather than focusing on  sledging, body line bowling  and other immaterial things. This loss is tight slap on Australia's face. I consider this win as a second best for any Indian cricket fan after world cup victory. India has created history by becoming the only team beating Australia on two consecutive series.
Australians are great people but we Indians don't like such toxicity, good efforts from them, I hope they would change, though lads from home did a stupendous job, Jai Hind!!
Kangaroo must learned his lesson.. He can't roar in front of Tiger.  Australians must know there place.. Never tease tiger.. In future. Results is brutal ...  Jai Hind 🏏🇮🇳🏏🇮🇳
Tim paine to Ashwin: can't wait to see you in gabba.  Tim paine at gabba:  Maakachud ye kya hogaya. 😂🤣 Really great win
Once a legend said ,see u at gabba.but history was wrong😀
At least his teammates like him....oh yeah and ash is a dickhead 😂.   Enjoy with your friends in this loss
"Can't wait to get to you the Gabba".....
Guy is about to break into tears. Poor chap bit more than he could chew. Indian stew with a lot of hard bones.
भारत शेर है क्रिकेट का। कंगारुओं का गाबा में किया शिकार। जय हिन्द वन्दे मातरम्।

You ain't coming to India, ever! Learn some sporting spirit and you'll avoid further pain e!
Poda loosukkkkkkk
In the morning Justin lenger was on top of the moon seeing the cracks in pitch, God knows how many cracks will emerge between Australian team now.  Keep glue with you , will be handy mate.
അടുത്ത സീരിസിൽ നീ ഉണ്ടാകുവോ ടാ?😂
Lavada come to India that will be u last time playing cricket in u r life, ask u r cheating mates they will teach u.
What’s your excuse now?
Amazon prime is signing the deal for the next webseries...the only positive thing Australia has gained from this series...😜😝
Congratulations young and talented indian team
Cant wait for gabba test mate😆😆😆
See you in India🤣🤣💪💪
Pant to pain:Aao kabhi haweli pae 😂😂😂😂
Pant to Paine-  You made me a, you made me a Believer..... Paine..🤣
Time to step down captaincy for Tim with Pain.🤭
Dear paine As aswin said we expect your presence hear in india.we want to give send off for you & your sledging
Gabba😂😂!!Painekiller
Thanks for sledging Indian Team and bringing the best out of them,
Had Shubhman Gill and Risabh Pant got chance in first Test, who knows, result could have been different and it would have been 3-0. Had Hanuma not got injured in 3rd, it could have been even 4-0.
I dont think his captaincy can be questioned. He is the same captain who retained the Ashes last year in England. Just a sport, get moving
Beta khun ka achu ro rha hai
TEAM IN PAIN 😰
Give captaincy to smith
He should be shown the door without any more delay. A very mediocre captain who can do no good for cricket Australia. This should be his last series
Do you know when Australia lost d match it's when wade sledging Rishab Pant on his over weight that's not at all the character that you have to show in the gentleman's game..It's the first fall of your team and next comes the frustrated Paine's over heated, unwanted conversation with Ashwin
worst captain ..he is 36!!he should think about retirement
Kuch indians abhi "I am from Australia" bolke like aur comment mangne aa jayenge 😝
And what's ur skill Mr. Paine? 🤣🤣
It could have been 4-0 india...... Just 1 bad session .
Cant wait you to get to Gabba. 😂..Karma being a bitch to Payne..😂
Ashwin was wrong....this was Paine’s last series 😂😂
They lost this match in Sydney
Its not Tim, it's his Karma speaking 😂😂
One of all time greatest moments in Indian cricket history, at par with 1983, 2007 and 2011 world cups.
is he crying....i reckoning like that??
Do i see tears in his eyes 😂😂
Nothing against him, & not a sarcastic comment against him.. But is he crying??.. It seems to be.!!
after all it all goes down as cricket winning...i wish us indians dont take it too personal and see this win as a license to troll aussies...they played really well. Wish them better luck next time
Don't cry bby,, shut Ur mouth first,
We were written of by many and thats how we reply through performance .....last 3 test series India won 2-1
Good play Aussies.. but don’t underestimate INDIA cricket team.. they ll come stronger when u sledge them.. INDIAN da ...
Surely he must have wished it rained.
Virat k bina nahi jit sakte ..ripe😂 4/0 se haregi india  ripe Ripe haters 😂
P A I N E 😂😂
Team pain harami
Look Paine is one of the best captain for Australia, but let's agree a cricket match with Australia that too a Test match that is played for 5 days till the last hour cannot be spicier than this. A tablespoon of blows to the helmet, 2 tablespoon of entertainment on the stump mics, and a handful of resurgence is all about this Test series.  Bottomline: From Ashes to Border Gavaskar, India, Australia and England are the three strong pillars/bollards of Test Cricket Thank you for the wonderful entertainment and for giving us a shimmer of new hopes in every aspect of life from the very beginning of 2021
Taking a lead from Rahane's gentlemanly behaviour, we will not speak ill or poke fun at Tim Paine. It is not easy to take a defeat after 32 years at their fortress.  They are a tough lot.  The more we cherish our victory, the respect for Australia only goes up as THE TEAM to beat.  We wish Australia all the best.
Now he can be at home and babysit as long as he wants 😂
I love tim he have done a mistake . love from india
Aur bhai...kaisi lgi?🥴🥴aa gya swadd??😂😂
Mja aaya No gain Only Pain Australian's 😂
It's time for pain to step down as test captain. Australia needs to get a permanent opening pair. They should invest on Alex carry as a wk bats. And the most imp the Ausie needs to rotate their bowlers like England did against Pak in 2020.
Meet at Gabba 💪Win at Gabba❤️
Ayyyeee... 😂😂😂
Defying the odds - one of the greatest series ever? They saw an hour of Adelaide and said this is surely 0-4. They said no chance without Kohli. They said no chance at MCG after Australia opted to bat. They said no chance after a collapse at the SCG. They said no chance of survival on the final day with battered bodies. They said no chance without Bumrah, Shami, Jadeja, Ashwin. They said no chance at the Gabba against an ominous bowling attack. And they said no chance of getting 328 on a Day 5 Gabba pitch with cracks. But here they are making history by winning back-to-back series on Australian soil - a series that's at least at par with the 2005 Ashes and they have done this without their regulars. A series to remember: It had everything: Heroes standing up, getting the KO, and then resurrecting themselves, apprentices turning master, boys becoming men, underdog stories, and some nastiness from beyond the boundary in Sydney that only managed to make Siraj's retaliation all the more romantic in Brisbane.
A tight slap on the face of those who predicted the series 4-0 in favour of Aus.
Lol tim paine believes indians grows up playing spin..n then shows up at their gabba fortress n show even our spinners like kumble are lions compared to their pussy cats fast bowlers.
Australia failed to escape this time 💪
Common guys don't pour hate on him.the banter was entertaining and I loved it. He is a good leader and lead the side well.   he was never abusive unlike ponting and Co. Through out the series they never crossed the line expect the crowd. The reason why India won is they never gave up. Which is why this series is special not only for us but to entire cricket feternity.
Tim Paine looks in Pain,anyway India could have lost this series also.But kohli less Indian team has rewritten history by defeating Aussies in Gabe .
I think Ausie this time excuses warner and smith wife not feeling well that’s by Ausie lost series
Tim Paine - Biggest troll in World Cricket right now. This maybe his last test series. Thank you Tim for missing catches and fuelling us to beat your team. We need a documentary about this Test Series
Winning and loosing is a part of the game but there are instances when you get respect even after you loose. But this guy’s attitude made him loose all the respect and became a troll piece for Indians..
ind vs Aus good teams to world good proformac  👍👍no impotent won or loss ,impotent is love to contry (desh)👍👍
Where is Marc Waugh,Ricky Ponting & Michael Clarke?🤭🤭🤭
पंत ने क्या पेला है ऑस्ट्रेलिया वालो को👍welldone pant or gill ❤️
Never underestimate the opposition you the Australian team..Jai Hind 🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳.. Happy Republic Day in advance..Vande Mataram🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳
Team pain lodu le le, lodu 😀😁😁🤓
Pink Ball captain.... Pinky
If he applies this talking sense in the field, he would have been a better captain. He has made things worse for CA.
Aur bhai aa gaya swaad😂😂😂
Now we Can't wait  to see u in india!  Be ready to face some heat from crowd!!☕ ur" last Series "
I scare about Australian media. Sorry paine don't feel.
കളി ഇന്ത്യക്കാരോടെ വേണ്ട മോനെ
Steve smith should receive more criticism for gaurd mark scratch and being arrogant about it. He defended it like assuming the viewers to be newbies.
Be prepared  for next series in India .. thik n then speak .
very very "PAIN"full
So why 97 dislikes ben stokes
Pls somebody tell Mr. Tim Paine that Mr. Rishabh Pant is now free for baby sitting...lol
Indian inexperienced bowling better was better than the experienced Australian bowling attack.
U wana indian team cm gaba again
3-1 win for India actually
Tim PAINe : whoever named him can see the future xD
Sly Fox
Tim Paine is not a cheater like Smith .. loosing is better than cheating and winning
Atleast my team mates like me.                    -dick head Payne
Tim paine still waiting for gabba test 🤣🤣🤭🤭
He is still waiting at the gabba
Paine don't cry give ur baby to pant and u just  focus on your wicketkeeping
Paine Said in Sidney test "I am not coming to India." He knows that his career is going to end in GABBA.
Paine's babies : See our babysitters is hitting supeerrr sixes... Paine : Both of u r grounded n no tv for u 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
You can see the “Paine” in his eyes
Well said Mr. Paine. Now, would you like some custard with that huge helping of humble pie?
paine ki pagilindi
Paine in pain for pant 😁
Now India is the powerhouse of cricket this is the era of India but remember they will get surely weak with time
Pain is crying
Ashwin is a legend u must not mess with him
Pichuaarya m Paine huaa na
Enjoyed the series. Tough cricket by both sides. Both teams played well. Indians showed lot more grit and resilience. It has been ages since Kolkota test match to have witnessed such wonderful test matches in cricket.
Change test captain
Tim paine , did not even win the verbal battle!! Did he ?
He is crying.... Ga   bba.......
Captaincy Gayi Iski
Thanks to tim paine😁😉
Tim Paine have now only Pain
Indian young players male him humbled 😂
Ky huaa or karo slazing  Beta Baap k Same Kam Uro
Tim Paine the useless player nd captain his career is ended
Can't wait to see you in India if maybe you're  selected 😂😂
Kya hua halwe..
Tim to Aswin : Atleast my teammates like me...😏😏😏 Teammates : 🦅🦅 Bhk bosdk catch toh pakdi nahi jati...🤣🤣🤣🤣
Indian team is better without Virat Kohli 🙏 no doubt Virat is a good batsman..but he is not a good captain. Kudos to Dravid under which Rahane n newcomers were robustly shaped
Caption of this video amuses me...... Pant was fairly beaten by Lyon many times...... When he wanted to finish the game early he mistimed the ball he was just a tad bit too lucky wade couldn't catch it....... But all in all fortune favours the brave, he was good and brave today...... Not to forget the immense contribution by Washington Sundar, Shardul Thakur and Mohd Siraj ..... Doesnt matter how their cricketing career will turn out....  they have left a legacy here
Pant made parmanent place in team but still have to work on keeping congratulations Pant & team INDIA All fan of cricket 👍🙏
Pujara will come in their horrible dreams!!!
We will see what you said to the team in “The Test” season 2 only on Amazon Prime soon. Cheers. See you in India(*if).
Wow will be interesting to see Aussies in India ,they are a fighting clan these people ,they will be itching to trump India in India.  Cummins ran in the whole day ,huge respect !!! All that brilliance from Australia was just not enough to trump this young Indian team ! Australia are still the team to beat in world cricket ...love Australia v India
Paine - can't wait to get you at Gabba.  Come to India, it will be your last series - Ash to Paine
India, remember 36,,,,,,,
Rohit, gill,pujara, kholi, rahane, pant ,sundar,ashwin,isanth,siraj,bhumra .... team for eng 1st two test matches (jadaja,shami,Vihari  unfit).  ......................(bench Thakur,kuldeep,agarwal ,saha,umesh)
Starc has no spark in his bowling needs to be dropped as well Lyon. They are liability to team.
Pujara deserves just as much credit as others
Jal rhi hai jal rhi hai...😂😂😂😂
Tim Paine is a result of worn condom 😂😂😂
We are waiting for ICC testchampionship trophy
Australian cricket team is in paine but e is slient.
Well played R .Panth,sundar,shardul ,siraj,and all tim india💪
Wanna baby sit your babies😅
TimPaine  you are not a cool dude man
Gajab beizzati ho gyi iski😂😂😂😂
Never Ever underestimate the INDIANS MIND THAT 🔥🔥
you guys over confidence and estimating other players as nothing, sledge made you loss
Paine in pain 🤣
Mr.michael vaughan better you consult a phsycologist for treatment of your narrow mindset
Next time any opposition team is gonna think a hundred times before they sledge or play mind games with India💯💯✌️
36 all out.... seniors injury....20 players played the matches....young and new players on debut...Vs A strong Australian team...no single person in the world would have predicted the final results... 2-1. The young yet a very brave Indian side just destroyed the fortress of Aussies...unforgettable day in the cricket history of both India and Australia. Very proud to see them sail through and clinch a remarkable victory.   Ay yes, Cric buzz commentary,  I just loving it. Superb
Tim paine in great pain after the series loss.
Aussie played dirty cricket. Bodiline bowling!!
वंदे मातरम 🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳✌✌✌💯💯💯 Proud to be an INDIAN 💯✌ PROUD TO HAVE SUCH TEAM AGAINST TIM 😂
Gravity don't pull my tears
Can anyone fell PAIN of Tim Paine 🤣🤣
36 Humiliation to 329 History
Canptaincy should be given to steve smith
I think he ll give retirement...... To baby sit 😁😁
I want Smith as captain of Australian team
WELCOME TO GABBA PAINE 😂
Historic day, great victory ❤️👍✌️💪 young guns new pride of Gabba ❤️❤️❤️thanks guys for such a great entertainment despite facing a lot ❤️❤️ sending you snow flakes from kashmir to throw on those who were doubting your calibre ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Come to gabba Paine is in lot of pain now...
Aa gaya swad
"Can't wait to get u at Gabba" its over paine
Ha ha ha he said that, "come to Gaba " 😂
3 bowlers in top 10(Australia) even then not able to win. That shows character of India.
1. T20 captain Rohit sharma. 2.ODI Captain Virat kohli. 3.Test captain Ajinkya rahane. India would be no.1 Side in all the three formats.
Don't mess with we Indians.! 😎
Sledge hammered the sledgers?!!!!
Mate you run ya mouth at your will wasn't effective enough to get this young team down instead Rishabh wielding his willow at his will had brought ur mighty team down. Kudos for Shubman, Pujara, Washi, Shardul and Siraj for their spectacular show. At least now Paine will stop inviting Indians to Gabba as he knows the pain of it.
Ammm ammm ammm
Just short of Crying 😢. Paine in lot’s of pain. Sometimes KARMA come back to bite you
paine  : Amm Lyon is a champion player..amm disappointed ammm
It was like loosing from India B team
captain of the year 😂😂😂
you lost because in entire series you insulted indian players. you lost because of bad karma. Be a gentleman in the future.
What a match what a series what a performance by  team india  WE ARE PROUD TO BE INDIANS🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳 First of all hats off to RAHANE - the man who helped india to comeback after huge loss of the 1st test match 36 all out😬 Next SIRAJ - The things he has been through in this series despite a great loss of his father😔,, racisal abuse, etc but you have raised as a player Next JASPRIT - the man who has bowled is heart and soul, most overs, leading pace attack Next pujara - The wall😁 Next shubman gill - Just a single word - QUALITY BROTHER👌 LAST but not least RISHAB PANT--- dude you are AWESOME 🤫 ROHIT SHARMA and TO ALL DEBUTANTS - thanks for entertaining us👍 We know we don't have our full strength team but this NEW INDIA 🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳
Poor...poor...bastard.
Well....See u at gabba
Only one player cause the damage for Australia i.e Tim Paine 😝😜
Malayali undo
No worry paine its cricket anything can happen..I wonder why people criticize u it can happen to anyone especially in sports soo be calm paine I'll always support Australia cricket...I only hope that u learn from such mistakes n move on...all the best for ur future...😊😊😔
We will see u again on Gabba... lol... dogs who barks don't bite
Myan if you drop catches like this you are gonna lose even with Afghanistan
Paine how much do want the wicket to open up?😂  What I have seen it did open up quite a bit in day 4, did the crack close in day 5?
Ohh poor tim paine about to cry😭
Ashwin right now you are gone mate Mr Tim paine now u can't come to India also 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Time to get McDermott, Head/ Usman khwaja and Pattinson in the team instead of Paine, Wade and Starc
I feel for him😔
Aggressive comments, unnecessary trolling will give you headlines, not win. Get out of that culture australian team and of course media
Smith should be a captain again
best of luck for the S.A series 👍
Too many nasty balls by Cummins and Lyon.
Don't cry now better luck next time
Hey  foxy look at your own face ! Can't really wait you to be dropped from the National side.
When anybody sledges or display ego time creates a situations to learn how to become human being
Well done India🇮🇳 Especially, pant, puji, Gill, Washi, Shardul & Siraj
Mat rulaao bechare ko...waise itni beizzati ho gaya! 😂
Captaine kadu nuvuu aus undavuv
Look at Tim's face🤣🤣🤣
Stop giving excuses...and also stop being such a racist
His face
India making temporary captains
269/7 se jab SUNDAR ne CUMMINS ko jo maarna start kiya He Demolishes CUMMINS Jo Coverdrives pe 4 and Hooks pe 6 mara, 1997 wala the GREAT DADA ka yaad dila diya.
If you talk too much it means some how you will embarrass yourself 😂😂😂
He missed the stump of Rishabh and saying they play spin growing up..... fellow we grow up fighting for everything and tolerating everyshit thrown at them and with waiting for opportunities to prove a point every moment
Imagine if he stumped Pant 🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄
Pathetic captain.....pathatic fielder and cud not defend 329
now ...was lovely to see u at Gabba mate😂😂😂
Looks like he got a proper pasting from Justin langer after the loss in dressing room just look at his face a tight slap from Justin langer 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Everyone is entitled to his/her own opinions. Just that.. We shouldn't go overboard.
Lyon 100 test is best memory in his career
dont know if any one noticed that australians talking about india population rather than skills and character shown by indian team
Ist match was Paine... N the final was Pain....🤣🤣🤣🤣
We need Rahane the Permanent Captain to win the test championship final.   Abhi bhi waqt hai.   Fir se bad 30 minutes nahi sunna chahte to
I hope some reporter asks him.."how does it feel to not be able to back up your talking with performances😂?"
Paine was checking 60-80% rain prediction on Google after match
Pujara is highly successful in making blowers get tired....
Mishbah - india covid ki wajah se jeeta
One minute silent for the paine bcoz he is in pain
India ne khoob pain de di yarrrrrr
Thank you Tim Payne for all the good memories.
Paine in Australia's ass now....be ready to be fired and demoted as a captain 😂😂😂 Piece of Shit Tim Paine!
Pain ,not tolerate anal pain
Paine: Dukhi man mere sun mera kehna Jahan nahin chaina wahan nahin rehna Dard hamaara koi na jaane  Apni garaj ke sab hain deewane....
I can feel the *pain* in his *paine* .
Main Culprit 😂
im an aussie but i have to give credit to india for being the better team of the series and we have to just bounce back stronger
Paine in pain 😂,aussies should have let Warner for captaincy .
Feel bad for him 😥
sir plz says tht word which u said to Aswin in last game..
You should blame all you retired players who miss lead you and made you think it will be 4-0 wash out , dont blame it on your self
Australian fans to Paine wah! Bete tumne toh moj kar di.... Tum toh bade heavy captian ho😂😂😂😂😂😂
Is bar perfect team thi aus ki or ind ki to balling bhut hi kmjor thi aus ne hlke me nhi blki ind ke players ne axcha khela h
“can’t wait to get you to Gabba” will haunt Tim Paine for the rest of his life.
Please check my channel if possible 🙏
Well done Team India!!
Australia can't play cricket he played Mind Games or Abusive language 👎👎
I think Mitchell starc need be dropped his bowling is very normal
He wanted to say can’t wait to see young India make history at gabba. Great victory jai hind.
Worse ever Australian captain in the history of cricket he has to go now that's for sure
Pichli bar ye bolre the ki Smith or warner nhi h tb jiti 2018 me Or is bar hmare mahan virat nhi the tb hm jitte  right naaa
It cannot be said before the victory of the series, (michle von)
अगली बार बोलने से पहले सोच लेना ।
Where is 4-0😀😀😀
He is not good,  u guys didn't play good
He is literally crying. We can see tears in his eyes.
Sack him only one reason is enough to sack him why mathew wade is keep playing in Aussie side
pain thanks for gabba
Cricket Australia should not remove Tim Paine from Test Captaincy . He took captaincy when Australian Cricket Team was  facing lots of problems and disappointment . He is a good captain and he should retain as a Captain. Many many congratulations to Indian Cricket Team for this historicl win and proud moment for entire country and countryman.
As an Indian I would like to appreciate Tim Paine as well, leading the Australian Team through Hard times when Smith and Warner are barred from doing the same. This man has a huge responsibility of leading a Team that never learned to accept anything less than a Win. Kudos to you Skipper Paine.
He missed pant stump at 16 . Chatter box paine ,no where he is suitable as Captain
this moments are to be in '' curb your sledging'' meme
In your face mY son😂😂Timpiii
“Gabba My Ass”
Can't wait to throw eggs and garbage on you Tim     Maybe not after all that shit happens in Australian culture not in indian culture
I always respect aussies because of their skills .. Ponting , Mcgrath  ,warne.. But paine is just annoying....You can't win only with sledging paine...
Paine is real pain for Australia
Winning and loosing is part of the game.. but what a series.. be proud 👍
Are you not ashamed of losing series to INDIA -A?
smith has to take over and I think there are better players in bbl then Tim. maybe by that he may comeback with a bang. all good well played aus .
Are ye to ro Raha hai....😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂
That how a new year should start....;
Eat the humble pie ,”Dick”cheating and verbal abuse never works .
Tim paine is still waiting for R Ashwin at Gabba.
Dont cry now think before speak
Let's not blame the wicket! It was all about application and execution.
SO ITS THE PITCH HELPS YOU WIN AND THE PLAYERS ?
Missed ishanth and his swag very badly..and his bouncer
Gaaba gaaba gaaba  gaaba  hi pane you need to pain killer😜 and go sleep   gaaba gaaba 😂😂😂
Fortress Gabba “CONQUERED”
What was the odds on the India win at start of play.
Tim "paine" the real pain for aus.
Aaur bhai ? aa gaya swad ?
Talk less work more mate ha ha ha haaaaaaaaaa LOOSERS
Now to give an excuse of a HUUUUGGGGEEE population!!!!!!
Test cricket won. Paine has had his share of hatred. Leave the man alone. They played in good spirits this game. He even owned up to making a mistake in the last game..admitting that he looked like a clown. After all it's just a sport!
Or BHI Nikal gya tera gabba.
Spiderman Spiderman tune churaya Smith Paine ka chain. 😂 on your face Aussies.
Concentrated on the game and not on sledging.
Your time is up bro choose another  profession.
he is almost stopping his tears. WELL PLAYED TEAM INDIA, BUT PLEASE DO NOT BLAME AUSTRALIAN TEAM. WE WON THIS TIME NOT BECAUSE AUSTRALIA PLAYED POOR, IT WAS BECAUSE WE PLAYED WELL.
Temporary captaincy ends here
Where r those expert...loollll
Sack him soon!!
Who  want Amazon prime series of this series?...it would be excited to watch...
"Can't wait to see you at gabba"
Your arrogance took you down. You being with the national side from 2011 doesn't scored a 100 yet and being kept in the side for sledging only
Ausi you lost reason is your over confidence
you must be missing your champion mate  "Steve" ,not Waugh . Bucknor
Indians always loves Australia ... We respect Ponting Gilchrist Warner ...
Better u resign from captaincy...if Australia retain you as wicket then opposition team will be winning definitely...
The rahane team well done . Indian captaincy  is test of will   and Thane proved  inspite of the absence  some big heroes .kholi and bcci has something to think about
These guys are saying India has 1.5 Billion population and that you gotta be pretty good to make it to the 11 that represent the team. Right then, if population was the reason, then China should've been the best Cricketing nation that way! Just agree that you guys fucked it up by selecting your 11 around those 3-4 main players. I mean Tim Paine's the captain of a team that has the likes of Smith, Warner, Lyon, Cummins, etc. That's ridiculous 😂 .. Ashes draw was a fluke. Australia should get rid of him and atleast make Cummins/Lyon the captain if not Smith.
I remember Paine suggesting Pant to do some baby sitting few years back. How quickly the tables have turned 😂
I wonder what happened to the innocent spectators who were wrongly accused of racial abuse???   NOTHING!!!  How disgusting that the Indian cricket player was not repremanded for this.
Don't bark if you can't bite 😉😉🙏🙏
Isne lagaan nahi dekhi....usme bhi gore match sledging ki vajah se hi haare the.....isiliye bola hai history jan na bahot important hai...lolz
Australian team to pujara: yeh diwar tutati kyu nahi hai
Chapar -2 kam kiya karo😂😂😂
Don't underestimate the power of pant ! Pant give u lot of Paine and serious knowledge ! Always respect Your opponents
Aaj lunch Nahi kiya press conference me 🤣🤣
முனியப்பசாமி வேண்டுதலை நிறைவேற்றிவிட்டார் வாழ்த்துகள் இந்திய வீரர்களுக்கு
*A time when the cricketing world is fed up containing VIRAT KOHLI India produces SHUBMAN GILL. He is not the next big thing, he is already a big thing* .
Next time  you culprits think before speak 🖕🖕💪💪
India never forget, India never forgive... 🇮🇳🇮🇳
I guess we won’t be seeing him at Gabba again any time soon...
Je to rone he LG gya phle to bhot hwa me ud rha tha
“Can’t wait to see you at the Gabba” - Tim Paine, India’s best motivational speaker🤣🤣🤣🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳
Don't cry 😭 man...
Don't judge  by it's cover the book.......
Till useless captains like u r there Aus will always be humiliated in home too .... 😂😂😂...
reason behind the defeat: arrogance
Karma will always come back to you.. Abusing or cheating will not win you matches. Learn and have respect to others in your life.
Gabba ka baba..🤣🤣🤣
Paine-ful 😄
BC wicket pichhe gali deta tha na 😂😂😂😂gand fat gyi 🤣
Can’t wait to watch behind the scenes on Amazon Prime 😂😂😂😂
Rishabh pant next 360
Tim Paine can only speak,  not keep
I will teach  cricket  to Aussie how to play cricket in ground😅
Happy retirement
Pietersen ka prediction 💯 right
Historic Win India , CONGRATULATIONS  It was unfortunate that i heard an howling sound when Tim Paine started speaking. It should have been avoided,
Don't insult an Indian Test cricketer with baby sitting sledges. Its racist and you got handed the lesson today. Hopefully you learn from it and pull your head in. Bravo Pant - true hero and can brag about this test series for the rest of his life.
First of cricket Australia should remove this muppet from captaincy.
Aussie is a  more cheating team In all match
Australia lost because they became 'cocky' from the last game. Test is a game of patient and girt, this day India did not had a match - they don't say this 'test' for no reason
Thats huge victory of India on Australia proud of India team
Congrats to India . Now Australia  it is a learning lesson not to underestimate  the capability of India
I think he very emotional.. can't wait gaba😂😜😜😜..never ever underestimate india🇮🇳🇮🇳💪💪🔥😜😜
Aab jara bol k dikha "Cannot wait to get to you  the Gabba"  Lol😂
Paine... You poked too much and now you are in pain... Gaba will be a permanent sore on you... The captain who lost the Gaba fort
All he can do is talking and talking                ~The Great Rishabh PANT
Paine: Can't wait to get you the Gabba! India: Rest is History.   😂😂😂
You can see it in his eyes he knows his time's running out. Feel bad for him
At least u can get draw y u took pujara wik 🤪🤪🤪
Abba see u at Gabba
And his skills allow him to do shit talks behind the stump
🤣🤣🤣 just cant stop laughing at the title of this video.. this man sledged pant.. and now has to praise him. Perfect karma🤣
11 players, umpires, crowd, hotel staff, former Aussie players ...... Indians outplayed all of us put together - Paine
Dilli aao tum boss abb tum dilli aao... 🤣🤣🤣
can't wait to see ur exit from captaincy 😂
See you at Gabba : Lord Tim Paine
Sabse bakwaas captain hai tim paine cricket ki history me
paine yr tu bohot bolta hai....player tu assha hai lekin as a sportsman not which everyone want
Don't take personal , it's game , that over.. good luck for future
Paine in Pain . 😹
No matter how much banter was there between teams... it was a cricketing feast.. pls Don Bully them dear Indians... frustration takes out bad things. It's human. Thanks cricket Australia for putting up a great show. This is Good for test cricket... better luck next time Aussies
Worst captaincy, good bowling, very bad attitude Australian teams against India..honest Indians well-done.
He was waiting for gabba for this?? So he could drop more catches and prove he is probably the most insignificant “captain” and keeper Australia ever had?? Cry in paine timmy 😂😂 that excuse of India’s population was a new low for even you.   We didn’t have virat bumrah shami ishant ashwin jadeja rahul and saini injured while playing the last test still we won the test and series and breached the gabba fortress and beat them at home with their full strength squad especially that fantastic bowling lineup of starc hazlewood lyon and cummins!!  Many “experts” like mark waugh and shane warne and the likes claimed a 4-0 Australia win was the probable result.... go analyze that oldies!!  We did it with a second or third rung side against your best full strength side!! Siraj sundar shardul natarajan were enough for us!!  Tim paine can chatter and blabber all he wants behind the stumps and miss all those catches and stumpings 😂 I am sure people like lyon smith warner etc wish paine just retires and they get a better keeper and a smart captain
Paine before this series: captain Paine after this series: commentator 😂🤣😂🤣
Paine in real pain.
Hahaha... Still relying on the pitch...  Dude, rely on your bowler and their skill. Pitch not going to help you every time. Pitch is same for both the sides. Its about the bowler, how they are bowling...
End of a stand in Captian .. australia should get a captian who performs well ..1 player less is no good for a team he missed stumping is Pant ..Sad if the selection process is this ..
I think this might be his last series as a captain and he might not get a chance to play in India 😎😎
Your are disgrace to CA and Humanity.... For your comment...NO  NATION Must have a captain with such mindset... RACIST AND A CHEATER...I am n never BITTER... WATCH  YR BIG MOUTH... Each time you speak... YOU LOOSE... Jai Hind...
I don't like when Australians say they have huge population so they have good players. Then China should be the best cricket team in the world. Our Indian players are very competitive and talented that's why they're the best not because of population.
We are waiting to get you to India. But till then will you be there in the team?????
Gill hitting 20 runs of Mitchel Stark that too without taking Risk. This is where India won the match , though finishing touch was given by Pant. About Pujara ( we don't mind giving rest to Kholi, Rohit, Rahane, but not to Pujara he has to do national duty.) As of now we don't have another wall which we can rely on.
Mavane... Vaayi.... Yo painey... Unn vela mattum thaan poyidunu nenaiykaathe.... Mavane unna naange vere levelile vaych seyuven.......
Paine: Come to Gabba Ashwin: Come to India, it'll be your last series Paine: Main aayega hi ni India....yahi mera last series tha🤣🤣
I think he's been in a tear .....jst look at his eyes
"We were totally not overconfident because we had experience and India didn't and we thought we were gonna smash their bowlers around like we did to England."  "We are basically helpless because the GOAT only works if the batsmen is defending. Pant was aggressive so he was useless. The fast bowlers cant bowl yorkers apparently so that's why we lost"
Tim Paine is'Sarfaraz Ahmed ' of Australia 🤣🤣
Maybe Steven smith did not CHEAT enough, that's why you lost   ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
I feel for this guy.
Mrs paine: honey its 6  Paine : oh my gosh they did they again hit a six? Mrs : its 6 o clock wake up and bring me milk and eggs😂  Ps : the tears in his eyes makes it extra special.
Unbeaten... mighty aussies.... gabba record...... young Indians bring it on....
Cricket is about talent, commitment and right attitude..."potty mouths" alone wiill not win you games.....
If Aussies were declared yesterday, he would have thrown under the bus.
DEEP INSIDE EVERYONE KNOWS, They Are Feeling Like The Guy Interviewed Outside The Bank In NOTEBANDI😂
We didn’t have virat bumrah shami ishant ashwin jadeja rahul and saini injured while playing the last test still we won the test and series and breached the gabba fortress and beat them at home with their full strength squad especially that fantastic bowling lineup of starc hazlewood lyon and cummins!!  Many “experts” like mark waugh and shane warne and the likes claimed a 4-0 Australia win was the probable result.... go analyze that oldies!!  We did it with a second or third rung side against your best full strength side!! Siraj sundar shardul natarajan were enough for us!!  Tim paine can chatter and blabber all he wants behind the stumps and miss all those catches and stumpings 😂 I am sure people like lyon smith warner etc wish paine just retires and they get a better keeper and a smart captain... Australia deserve a better keeper and captain!!
Lyon was even gifted a jersey by Rahane for his 100th test
Can’t wait for you to get to the Gabba Ash.. so that you can win the series without even playing there
He is in shock!!!
Actually he is trying to say " ma chudi pari hay ".
Best bowling line up couldnt take 20 wickets and young inexperienced bowler took 20 wickets in Australia 🔥💪👏👏
Happy retired life Paine...  Its time Australia has a permanent captain...   and to Ricky ponting need to learn a true lesson - your daily bread comes from India.  If you cant say good things least you can do is keep your mouth shut.  Heard a gentleman called Don Bradman ?  After he retired he maintained golden silence.  Thats why he is called the Greatest of all.
Ninaku pain edukkunnundo paine
You guys have a lot of expectation from the pitch..trust your abilities more..leave things you can't control..
Njoy the retirement now 😂😂😂😂
Probably the great test series win for India ever: 1. In Australian pitches and probably the best pace bowling attack Australia has ever had.  2. Skittled out for the second lowest test score of 36 3. Missing 6 main players , including the best batsman and best bowler in the world.
Last series h tra
Where is Rickyponting the punter he jumping all over the seat against India.
ek baar ki baat hai  ek gyani purush rhte the , unhone kaha tha Gabba chalte hai fir kya maa chif gyi 😂😂
Tim paine is suitable to australian captain...need to change new captain
Hey Timmy have you heard of "temporary captain " Now it's your time to go out of aus team mate😂😂😂😂
Just look just look at his baby about to cry face 😢😿😭😂😹😩😢
Shastri tonight...Drinks on me boys..😂😂😂
See u in the gabba man😂😂😂😀😀😀😀 shame on you
You should have waited for gabba 😂😂
Has anyone notice that umpires were very scared to give Indian batsman out today. Thanks to DRS otherwise we would have won much more series in Australia in past itself.
Paine - get you energy away from sledging to the actual game buddy
Life is like a test match but my fate is like Australia 🤣🤣😂😂
Now australia will say india has won bcoz of it's population. That's the stupidest thing i have ever heard 🤣🤣
In what other team would Tim Paine be good enough to be in a Test team? At this rate - do Australia deserve 4 Test series given they are as good as Bangladesh?
Iam sorry 😪😪Tim 😥😥Paine 😂😂😂😂
This guy has lost all respect,if their was any.
Na run h na koi record h tumhare paine.....bs baate kra lo
More power to you paine .
Every team has a bad series . India also lost in ODIs . So let's just respect sportsmanship .  They are international players , competitive cricket is but obvious . So let's not drag these comments out of the field . Hope we win all our overseas tour .  Love our team India 💖❤️
India is the new Australia!! This is what i see - league cricket has helped India and league cricket has destroyed Australia.  I think Sheffield shield was a benchmark for a lot of countries to look upto and BBL has ruined it . The level  of batsmenship has dropped in Shield cricket and the numbers of centuries pre BBL era werw much more compared to post BBL . I think Australia might have to come up with a plan like not allow cricketers to play 20/20 league till after certain age and groom them in Shield cricket before letting them out in the wild .
😁😁😁 oh Cary
Allow us to host u in India
Hi Sri pain ji aapse kuch kehna tha ..muh mey lega😂😂
I always wondered what if pain had a face
it was a brilliant strategy by India, to take match deep into the final hour (a kind of MSD style),  and go blast for last few overs. the 53 run partnership between Sundar and Pant blown away the Aussies. Outstanding.
Aus lost because of paine.
Let's have a moment of silence for this man lmao
Indians to tim paine : haa pata hai chal apne baap ko mat sikha 😂😂😂
I think paine was just excited at Sydney, he said what he said just after being a little excited and that's what this series an interesting one had to give that to paine.
What your wife says best babysitter is rishabh pant she said wrong that's you better you sit your home and take care the children.
Paine is getting more pain 🤣😂
कौन कहता है कि आसमां में सुराख नहीं हो सकता, एक पत्थर तो तबीयत से उछालो यारों...! Well Done Team India !!!
I don't know why  i just have too much respect for paine .
Back in past we compare our team with the Australian team. But from now this Indian team set the standard, tell the rest “COPY THAT”.. This will be a huge blow to the Australian team.
My XI for the WTC final at Lords (against NZ) this summer:  1. R. Sharma 2. S. Gill 3. C. Pujara 4. V. Kohli 5. R. Pant (wk) 6. A. Rahane (c) 7. R. Jadeja 8. H. Pandya* 9. S. Thakur 10. M. Siraj 11. J. Bumrah   * Assumes he has recovered enough to also bowl in 4 months from now, and Shami is unlikely to be available.
You should just shut your mouth... Did you turn up at Gabba??? The Indians did
Pant  :Have u heard a temporary captain😂😂
And it is your skill which allows you to quit captaincy
He is been fucked
Welcome to gabba
Why does media give Tim Paine credit for bringing Australia out of sandpaper gate saga and bringing Australian cricket back in track ?   The change in fortunes of Australian cricket came only after the return of Smith and Warner. He has hardly blooded any new bowlers, it's just been the four in Starc Cummins Hazlewood and Lyon.   This series he brought in Green but hardly used him as a bowler. Also Green's contributions with the bat were not significant enough to play as a pure batsman.  The ploy of giving starc just 3 over spells were pathetic too. He could have dropped him in favour of Neser who has been travelling like a Kuldeep Yadav with the team.   Also the move to push wade up and down the order and drop Head who had a better record as batman were dubious decisions.
ICC joke of the decade award goes to Tim Paine "See you at Gabba" 😂😂😂
Arrey chacha o b*******le chacha😂😂😂😂
Bc agya na apni aukat pe
Good
please dont troll this guy. he has enough. poor guy will made be scapegoat.
You should retire and and do commentary 🙏
Please think before you speak 😂😂😂 otherwise next time you will lose more badly 😂
This is why u invited indians to gabba?? India might have drawn.. but i thinks its u who boosted.. u will always be a good coach for the opposition team.. and when r u coming to chennai??!!
Can't wait to see at gabba where time Paine losses his captaincy.
His Career should be over. I don't recall he did anything great for his test team. Accidental Captain, LOL
time to remember how india got an independence. without violence. thats exactly we did in the ground and we won
Moral of Test series for India is  Will power is greater than ⭐ Power
I have never seen Australia been Broken literally like this.. u can See all are crying inside..
Did u like gaba u bla bla bla God and learn some shots useless
Did keeping the ball feature in your "plans" Tim?
Time to give captaincy to Smith back and just concentrating on keeping 😁😆
Time for paine to baby-sit at home 🏠
This is the next big thing for india after 2011wc and 2013CT
moral of the story   never predict cricket
Tarass a rha hai ab iss pr.....
THIS IS THE YOUNG GUNS OF INDIA DONT UNDER ESTIMATE INDIAN BATTING LINE UP MATE WE WILL THRASH U IN UR SOIL IN UR  OWN PITCHES AND WHERE IS UR COMMENTATORS RICKY , SHANE WARNE , MATHEW HADDIN THEY HAVE TOLD 4-0 WE WILL CLEAN SWEEP INDIA WHERE ARE THERE MATE SHOW THEM OUR UNEXPERIENCED BENCH CRICKETERS HAD DONE THIS.
Aus nahi ho raha kya ?
The Ashes home series is near, and that saved his captaincy bcoz changing captain now would be really turbulent. But as Gavaskar said, your days are numbered Paine. 😏
Looks like Paine is crying
One Word: Spider-man Spider-man
Summary of his complain "The dam pitch played fair unlike, our media and commentators" For Tim Paine's Australia its not enough  to  a) win all the tosses in the series  b) play with a full strength team against a depleted opposition  c) Crowed and media support, the sledging   the excuse "the pitch didn't deteriorate as we thought". Any other team would have said opposition was better then us ....Period!
Thank you Australia for hosting a wonderful series... the best one infact...  I am glad that india came on top... but dont feel let down... Australia is still one of the best cricketing world country... i am sure light will shine again... Good luck...  and love from india... 👍👍👍
Paine in pain
Le me: If Pain had a Face? Time Paine: His face after series loss to India
When Australia lost the 2018 test series there were talks on cummins replacing paine as captain..  I think it will happen now.
It's quite strange how we blame Ravi Shastri when team lost but not praise him for this fantastic win...
Ask another two questions he will be crying . But anyway feeling sad for him . Well played India 🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳
' Tim Paine ' , AUS lost in a ground they haven't lost for past 32years, guess who was the captain.
Ashwin: can't wait to get you to india, that will be your last series Tim paine in Gabba: well this could be my last series. Happy retirement paine, we indians wish you all the best in your future endeavours, maybe he will babysit and virat kohli and anushka can goto watch a movie.
I think Tim has played his LAST Test Match as the Captain of this Australian Team 😔
No one asking about paine saying to Ashwin :- Can't wait to see you at Gabba you deckhead😝
Come to Gabba baby
RIP TEAM PAINE CAREER AND MICHAEL WAUGHN PREDICTIONS 😥💔💔
If all the players were available, it could have been 4-0 I guess 😉
I feel langer is too strict with the aussie players their relationship seems toxic
See you at the Gabba, Mate! lol
To put it in perspective, The Aussies have no clue what hit them, for they cannot even fathom a scenario like this befalling them. For they have not been besmirched in this manner, and getting used to being humbled and outplayed is something they will need to get used to, the players and their pompous, arrogant retired cricketers. Believe the hype, mate!
Gabba record rest in peace
Too much pain in this video.
Team pain ( Australia ) from inside : Are maa ch*di padi hain 😂😂
घूस गयी सारी अकड़ चुतिया
Every Aussie is a gentleman after retirement
I noticed this point from Pain and also from Langer regarding the Indian population (exaggerated 1.5B people) and how good you have to be to play for India.... isn’t it the same from last so many years and why have they started saying this to make everyone compare the pool of people to choose from....... i guess Aussies are not the same anymore.... bad looser 😜
Tim paine be careful what you wish for next time
acc to Tim Paine ,kohli and pujara are just normal player for him
Can’t wait to see you at gabba mate 😝
Ghapa Ghap in Gaba 😂
What's population got to do with it.. Even Justin Langer says that.. Pretty lame cliche
Guys he's a good human. Be humble
Problem is with their batting except smith na labuscagne no one is scoring runs ..too dependable on them oly
You must be " Pained" with your poor wicket keeping and captaincy.. Time you washed your mouth out too!
Smith: Feeling disappointed, missed cheating opportunities in this innings
AUS team management should terminated Tim Paine. It's feel pained... 100 times should thought before sledging 🙄🙄🙄🙄
Paine to ashwin: can't wait to get you to gabba. Ashwin to paine (revised?): that will be ur last match as captain 🤣
Paine never forget this pain.ur behavior is not like an intentional captain.u r the worst captain Australia have ever seen.Waugh is the best and I respect him
Kabhi aana Mumbai me 😂
Stump-mic was your biggest enemy, Mr. Paine. It revealed everything.
The beauty of the series was there was no one man show...every time we were knocked down....some or the other player stood up to the task...this is a team win....❤️
Calling people overweight well that weight helped too smash u
Ghabbha ghab in Gabba
See you gabba....   Ben stoke........
Lesson of Downunder Series # Depleted and Bruised India C defeated a fit favourite full strength Australian team,media,umpires and crowd.. Kudos to Team India...🙏😚☺️
Sledge more lose more have a big mouth an  cant back it up.
He is the captain...he is accepting the defeat .....however it was a memorable series....js loved every bit of it
Lol Australian commentators and tv man show the screenshot of 1003vs 13 wickets experience now in tv screens ....
Tim Paine to Ashwin- I am sorry BaBu 😭😭😂😂
This Indian team has given free license to Virat Kohli to have a second child before joinig the team
Population ki wje thodi jeete hai bewkoof Paine 😂 haar haar k iska dimag kharab hogya hai !
Bahut jaruri tha
Paine deserves another chance. He is a nice guy with good sense of humor. He is a good wk batsman .He should captain SA series..
paine destroyed over 3 decades old gabba fortress built by aus legends
Ashwin: bro come to india that would be your last test series Pane: don't worry bro i won't be coming india in next series since this is my last series 😃
How's the "paine" mate..?
😢 cry 😭 pain cry 😭
Even after  cheating ,they lose 😂😂😂
Ashwin to paine-:Kyu bhai aagaya swaad.
Last series prophesy by Ashwin
It's a torture for him to be captain. Ben stokes and now Pant - his list will continue - he should retire.
This Australian team still won't accept the skill of Indian batsman. Still they keep complaining that the pitch didn't open up like they expected. It was with the same siraj and shardul created demons to Aussie batsman.
New excuse for ausies in this series : india won coz they have 1.3Billion people😂
when will Australia win a test series against India again?? feel like this is going to be similar to Australia vs England in the 1990s where Where England didn't win a series.
Just wanna see Mark waugh's Face right now 😁 Aur bhai aa gya swaad 🔥🔥
Well played Team Australia .
He is on the verge of breaking down.poor captain.
Still they are not giving enough credit still they are saying they had the chance to win why not they just accept india outclassed them with their backup team these guys will cry today and I will have happy good night sleep 😀
Where is ponting now?,,
TIM in Pain😭😭😭😂
NEXT TIME THINK BEFORE YOU SPEAK
Can't wait you get off  the team painey
Even as an Indian I can feel the pain in Tim Paine's eyes Cricket sometimes is such a cruel game. I am obviously elated by the Indian win but, I still feel for the Aussie's someone like a Cummins and Lyon bowling their heart's out. This series was so enthralling because Australia fought hard too so the Aussie's should also be proud of the effort they put in.
Previous tour bowler b4 2017 was weaker .. yet india lost ( having best batting line up )  Review system even helped india
Its time for australia to change their test captain
Your captaincy is gone “mate”... was lovely to see u at Gabba mate😂😂😂
Almost he's stopping tears
Initially he seemed a decent bloke, at times prayed for his success, but this series has shown that it was all a facade. I don't think he'll stay long now,well, but you have to give him, what an eventful career this guy has.
Kind of feel bad for him becoz Australian media is brutal , yeah he's not bright enough but things happen right 🙄
I always admire Australia for being Australia, but honestly why this captain is crying, he should not have come to press conference like this. In Winning you cry, people will appreciate but in loosing you cry, people will tag you as a kid. He is an Australian test captain, let me repeat Test captain not odi nor t20, even in loose he should always keep head high and also take care of his teams. Today is a lose but tomorrow there may be a celebration time, so be prepared for all the ups and down of the game  Hard luck and better luck next time.
'Come to Gaba they said'
You still think the pitch didn’t do enough? Just coz you couldn’t get 3 more wickets? You want all good length balls to hit the helmet? And all bouncers kissing the pitch? What do you want? The pitch was doing A LOT. Pujara got hit atleast 12 times. Lyon spun balls going directly to first slip. Even the Australian team witnessed the demons in the pitch in their second innings batting. Just that India attacked well, came down the pitch, tried to leave good balls and made sure the run rate was under check all at once.
I thought the Gabba was the fortress that he couldn't wait to play at😂😂😂
Waiting for Harsha Sir and Adam Collins chatter 😯
Tim Paine is not a good captain.
Tbh I feel sad for him
A new test era of an australian cricket team 🤣😂🤣😂😂🤣😂🤣😅🤣😂🤣🤣🤣😅🤣😂🤣🤣😂🤣😂😂😅😅🤣😂😅😅🤣🤣😂😂😅🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂😂🤣😅🤣😂🤣😂😂😂🤣😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂😂🤣😅😅😂
Paine: we'll get you at Gabba! Pant: 🎶 spider-man spider-man 🎶
is he actually weeping lol
My country is win 💪💪💪💪🙏🙏🙏😎😎😎😎🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻
For every Pujara, there is an equal and opposite Pant...!!!
Bharat mata ki jai🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 this series victory is bigger than 2018-19  With lots of players were injured  Mja aa gya puri test series mai Thoda bura lg rha hai  Because it all over now Bura isliye lg rha hai  Maine cricket or kuch wwe k alawa kuch nhi dekhta No tv series  No movies  No those idiotic songs  Nd i don't give a shit about t-20s   Nd 2 minutes silence for those  Who were praying for rain 😏😏
Aus, 4-0 ??? 🤣🤣🤣🤣
When pant's on fire, it's paine in the ass
I think Paine will have time to babysit since he'll be free now
India aane se phle hi iska career khtm ho gya
Thanks for inviting us at Gabba mate . Loved ur hospitality.  Can't wait to see you again in Mumbai, Chennai, Ahmedabad,  Kolkata,  Delhi infact wherever you want in INDIA.
Let me help he is just saying what that guy in demonitisation meme said
Banter aside.. Australia played magnificent cricket. They were equally deserving of the win and were no less clinical than India. Well done to both teams.
Paine must be in alot of Pain. His eyes says it all.
cant wait for u to come to rank turner Chennai and get badly  beaten
I am here Michael Clark who say if India win series they can celebrate for year 😂😂😂😂 he is right we are celebrating 🤩🤩🤩🤩
Look at him, he looks clueless. never in my life i thought I'll see a australian captain as clueless as him. And i remind you this is a country where being a test captain means you're second most influential man in country.
Hello,ponting..dont under estimate any team as u do against India..All days not yours always..Learn from India..
India 🔥🔥🔥
bad captaincy ... u must resign
Worst captaincy and poor wicket keeping  by Paine cost the Aussies test series and a place in for WTC final
ahhh blame the pitches 👍
Loude, Think twice before you speak.
The test season 2 will come I think...
Bol n..madh. ... Bol n madh...
Ravi Shastri vs Justin Langer 😂😂😂😂😂
Come to Gabba that’s probably ur last match next time come to babysit here 😂😂
"See ya at Gabba...."  - Pine
No questions on the prolonged body-line tactics that has made cricketers into punching bags and deepened the injury crisis??
Well it's actually bad to see how sad he looks
Lose and win happens but being a good human being on the field matters which Tim failed miserably in.
Now Tim paine feels the real pain...😂😂
Tim done India a favour by pumping them up
Saw u at Gabba mate
Paine thanks for your service mate !  Australian sledgers will miss their captain !
🤘🤘😎😎
Ashwin was wrong. This will be his last series after this defeat, not after aus visit india.
Australian bowlers are outstanding throughout this series. Australia too deserve this victory 🤝
"Cant Wati to See you in India Mate , That Will be last Visit "
Can't wait to have you in the gabba ash 😈
With today's win at Brisbane, India has won in all the major test venues in Australia
Starc and Paine, Unsung heroes for India!
Cricket is the great game
I wish anjikya rahane could continue as a captain because I think he is born leader
1988: Greenidge Haynes Richardson Hooper Richards Logie Dujon Marshall Ambrose Walsh Patterson  2021: Rohit Gill Pujara Rahane Pant Agarwal Sundar Thakur Saini Siraj Natarajan  The last two visiting XIs to win a Test match at Brisbane.  ‘Come to Gabba’, eh?
rip gabba
Best test series win for India after their win against WI and England in 1971
"Can't wait to get to you the Gabba".The rest is history.
Loved the Gabba mate🤭🤭hahaha jokes.. it was an amazing game of cricket.. India were amazing.. greatest win after 2011 world cup
He need some pain killers seriously!!
Rip tim Paine 🤒🤒🤒🤒
Tears in his eyes 😪, history created by youngistan
Paine-full stumping miss
Excellent knock rishabh pant!!
Time to Babysit.. that'll reduced the "Paine"
Team Pain😂😂😂
Steven Smith must captain Australia in Test Cricket. Mitchell Starc, Mathew Wade should be dropped from the team. Tim Paine should play only as a Player
How's the Gabba mate...
I can't wait for the GABBA test ..
India 🇮🇳 always fight back any circumstances ✌️ this series.  Australia loss because of Paine fielding and lack of planning .
You paid the price for your on field and your spectators off field antics mate🙄 Karma!
2018/19 - aus have no Smith and Warner and people blame that for the series loss  2020/21- India don’t have roughly 9 first team players and still win series 2-1 against a fully strong aus team
Ever ever langer😂😂😀
🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳What a test match & what a historic win for team India . It's even bigger than the world cup in my opinion .     Best example for "Never underestimate anyone" . 🇮🇳World cricket has seen many brave fight backs. But in current scenario, when a side looses half of its regulars to injuries....Facing hard quarantine, hostile media, crowd, racial abuse, lost  best batsman in Kohli...even loosing top performers during match... A team will be down and out loosing all hopes. But with all these adversities.... a team believe in their skills, potentials.... Back themselves....Come back hard against a tough opponent  and that to in their own back yard.... Called terrific Character. Considering these circumstances... one can easily say these  last three test matches will go down in history as most exciting and terrific fight backs the world has ever seen.. All credit goes to Team India .✌️👍 Love this team .🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳Jai hind
What a match today. One of the best day in Indian test cricket history. Test cricket is the best cricket than any other format of cricket and currently Indian cricket team is the best cricket team than any other teams in the world.
i am ill "  "And I don't have any job "😢 "But Youtube is not giving me views" Ya I am wrose than other"  "1k ke liye sirf 685 more 😖😖👈🙏
