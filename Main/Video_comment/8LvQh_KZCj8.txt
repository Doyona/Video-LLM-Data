Arms displays great acting ability in this video.
Breaking character at the end.  Love it...
0:52 They put a plaid blanket on the sofa and a suit on the bed just to combine the two into sofa-bed with a plaid suit? Name me a more clever and brilliant YT channel.
Please bookcase, we know you haven't actually read any of those.
Hotel Nightstand is such an underrated gag in this video
Im an English lass from Yorkshire and have only just found these guys! Just my cup of tea! No smut or profanity but just wit and the right amount of silliness. Hilarious!
"Oh yeah, Stein Beck!" Great intonation
Absolutely brilliant!!  Such talent!!
Words cannot express the genius that is Foil, Arms & Hogg! 😂
Great sketches!!
Funny and clever.
You forgot shelf
I wish there was a bedside table that kept stealing bookcase's books and not reading them quickly enough for his liking. (But at least bedside table reads them, unlike that posturing coffee table. =p)
Coffee table should have been short and have a joke about running into him, happens all the time.
Costumes are spectacular!
80s? Best sofabed I have ever had is from the 1950s. Damn thing has worked for my family for at least 3 generations.
Do have a coaster? No Coffee table walks away...🤣🤣🤣
I just had to pause the video for a moment to wrap my head around the idea of the cocktail cabinet and sofa-bed being an item.
1:50 a skip? What's that? 😅
Have you got a coaster? No. Walks off😂😂😂😂😂❤❤
Poor sofabed I love him
Boycott ikea
Well observed 😂
When are you performing in England 😂
Clever.
Always amazed by the level of insightful comedy you can deliver!!!! 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
"Sorry, is it multitasking if you do both tasks badly?"  Ouch! But also very true. Noone can truly multitask
These have GOT TO BE the MOST CLEVER VIDEOS!!!! SOOOOO GLAD I started watching them. Poor Sofa/Bed!!!!
…at least I can hold my liquor…😂😂
0:02 wait.... How could he be clean????
The sofa bed was my favorite part.
Thecend where they both craic up at the 101 movies to see before you die 😂 these boys are gold and represent whats great anout Ireland... our humour and wit 😂❤
No one invited the futon.
1:48  My brain read “sofabed” as “son of a bed”
😂😂😂😂❤
What? No Faulkner?
The hotel nightstand is so on point. Those bibles used to make me really uncomfortable as a child, me not being Christian.
Aw, a kiwi doomdah. 😃
'What part of Sweden?'  'Ikea'!😅
They really missed out on the repressed gay closet!
0:35 not me laying on a sofabed rn
Oh I am so gutted I missed you guys in NZ!!! 🎉 come back and bring some sunshine 😂
Adorable
Great skit! Come to Georgia in the US already!
Bed and sofa are just MEAN towards sofabed!
1:23 Arms channeling some serious Dylan Moran, here. I don't know if he even realizes just how much "Black Books" he's pulling off with that emoting lol.
🤣😂🤣😂🤣
cocktail cabinet x coffee table!
Next: Dictators throw a party!
These guys are so frickin clever ..not a single play misses !!
These guys have some remarkably well-fitting outfits for these sketches -- it's as if they've been tailored!
The Rug saying : What's wrong with me ?! I keep repeating the same patterns over and over again... I've been laughing for 10 minutes now 🤣🤣
Love the dooomm daaahhhh!!!!
I had to Read Of Mice and Men by John Steinbeck in class and I hated it. America might have had some good authors but I don't know why he's considered one of them.
The Bible on the hotel nightstand 🤣🤣🤣
Coffee Table says he's well read, but he's never even cracked the spine of that Tom Ford book 😄
Love the closing! Ah doom daaaah!
"Bed, are you alright?" "No, I couldn't sleep" "What happened?" "newlyweds"  Also the IKEA wardrobe looks positively Nordic
Wahey!
Coffee tables disgust at the lack of coasters was genius!! 😂😂❤
Brilliant
Do you have a coaster? 😂😂😂😂that innuendo grants a new perspective on "put a ring on it".
Just brilliant…. Like always 😂
Cocktail  cabinet, at least i can hold my liquor, Just slipped right in there..Ace.
0:20 tie tucked in 2:10 tie pulled out
Who even writes these 😂😂😂😂😂
Loved this
All the characters!!! Another amazing video!!
I once wrote a short story about a talking furniture in a downridden museum (Terry Prachett style)...
I’m not even religious but there’s something strangely comforting about hotel room Bibles
You are in New Zealand you lucky sods! I hope you have a blast, on and off stage💚hopefully seeing you again soon in ol'Dub city. Until then, take good care of each other, and please write LOADS of material. Best, Evy
Arms like a born snob and Hog's wanna-be snob got rid of my abstinence syndrome after the Snob's  death 🙃
:-D :-D :-D :-D :-D :-D :-D !!!!! - YOU are just my very favourites !!! ...OK, I might have spent the last half an hour in meaningful relationship with the liquor-cabinet, but I mean it - You are the best :-)
The banter is brilliant!  Poor Garden chair having survived winter; the Ikea wardrobe not admitting until the last minute! And Coffee Table skipping out on Cocktail Cabinet due to the lack of coaster!
I'm in love with the garden chair, just so awesome 😂
At least I can hold my licor 😂😂
“Do you have a coaster?” “No” Animal 😂
A video that's so funny that even the actors can't help but laugh, lol 😁
please explain me regarding garden chair and armchair: - there's a skip out the front...  what does a skip mean?
Really well done !
brilliant! but I missed the IKEA Expedit for vinyl records!!😄
I can hold my liquor😂
Hahaha I love you guys ❤
waiting for bloopers for this. Love that it cuts off after the coffee table says ''Architecture'' 🤣.
I watched this video and my phones battery went from 12% to 15%, I haven't plugged in my phone since this morning
Poor garden chair 😥 But don't worry. We LOVE you 💜😽😽 What would be the garden without you? ☺️
The coffee table was brilliant!
Fun fact: in England furniture dress more extravagant than people
"Oh no, he's opening up!" "I don't think so, it's too difficult for him" 😆 🤣 😂
One of your best!! Can't stop laughing.   Out loud.  Like for realsies!!
This was a gem! Keep em coming
I bloody love these so inventive. Thanks! Amazing job again!
If you are going to pose as sophisticated then at least spell Steinbeck correctly.
Coffee Table asking if you have a coaster hit me hard.
This is brilliant!
Perfect.
One of the best ones yet 😂 Loved all of them, but I think the garden chair is my fav!
Rug: "I keep repeating the same patterns, over & over & over" ❤😆
Great sketch lads. And ye have 850k subscribes now too 😀
Garden Chair is my favorite character.
Where have you guys been all my life?! Your sketch slipped into my FB feed and…you had me at immigration! 😊 Then Anne and Oisin…then fruits and veggies partying….now I’ve binge watched all your videos and am a FAHn! Hoping you come to the U.S. again so I can see you live.
Can I offer u a drink? ....Do u have a coaster ?! 😂
😂😂😂
So we'll done
Excellent 😂😂😂
Cool❤ NZ
Come to the South Island next time please! Couldn't get to see you in Welly or Akl 😢
I loved the "at least I can hold my liquor joke."
We do realize that these men have mastered personification, right? Beautiful scenes
I saw the sofabed opening joke coming and it still had me wheezing xD another brilliant and perfectly relatable party, love this series!
Brilliant!
I am absolutely convinced that the idea for this skit came when the boys saw that one shirt and said all at once "that'll make anyone look like a living room rug."
Poor sofabed….
The gardenchair could be ours, it also suffers the harsh outside all year long. I am happy they at least can party once in a while
Home Nightstand: *tissues, a lamp or something* Hotel Nightstand: Can I interest you in the Word of God?
Oò
The coaster joke came out of nowhere and it was top tier
The rug's patterns line was absolutely hysterical
Poor sofabed bit harsh there lads 😂😂😂😂
brilliant. Garden Chair is a winner!
The dining table didn't get an invite eh? 😂
Alternatively, what the coffee table is reading is a heavy book called “九寨溝風光" and only 2 people have flipped it in the 15 years after it was bought. 😂
@2:14 subtitles spell Steinbeck wrong and I'm 100% convinced it's on purpose lol
Who invited Hotel Nightstand? I thought this is supposed to be a private party! :=)
"I keep repeating the same patterns over and over" - this line was pure gold.
Makes me smile every Thursday 😊
Wait... where was the porcelain throne?    It's furniture... sort of.   The seat that everyone needs but no one invites.
There's seemingly nothing you can't do guys! This one was super funny and made my morning. Thanks.
Using the word "Liquor" to appeal to the American audience. I'm on to you lads! 😂
Plot twist: Arms actually has a book on his coffee table called "101 Movies To See Befor You Die"
Another hilarious video, but the whole sofa bed part, and coffee tables pronunciation of the word architecture just had me in stitches😂
You can see Bookcase starting to crack as Coffee Table looks for an answer to his question 😂
Just got tickets for Cardiff show. Can't wait to see you guys live!
Do you have a coaster?   No.  Runs off.
As someone who has slept 2 weeks on a sofa bed ... they really are understanding the uncomfortable, clunky and annoying factor. Specially if you need to undo and fold the bed every morning and unfold and make the bed every night)
I think this is the best party yet!  🎉
IKEA 🤣
Really enjoyed this sketch!! Also I just noticed your endscreen that says "wanna be sound? Subscribe" so I guess I'm officially sound.
An enthusiastic crowd, but a bit out of tune! Cheers, NZ
I am insulted that Rug didn't say he "kept walking all over me"
Who  knew furniture could such snobs!? 😂
Do a “the irish counties have a party” with each county with their own accent
YAY NEW FOIL ARMS AND HOG VIDEO
So sofa and bed are basically slagging themselves in their troubled years?! Great! 😂
Love the cravat on Mr Bookcase.
So good fun jokes.  Now you reminded me of the furniture word. In Romanian is " mobila " & nobody knows why.... Something that it" stays" is called " mobil... 😍😂😀
As usual you wrap up furniture personalities perfectly! Laughed all the way through this! I always thought that this was going on in my house. How about the decorative baby grand piano we have in our hous😂 that not one person attempts to play?
Garden chair—poor thing
I was in that crowd! You lads were absolutely Amazing. Thank-You for the Wonderful show, and uploading brilliant content 😊
Your writing always blows me away.
I'd love to see the antique grandfather clock that is sleepy old man that keeps making old man noises every hour!
Haaaaaaaahaaaaaaaaaaahaaaaaaaaaaaa
Rug... nice shirt 😅
Do you have a coaster?  Brilliant.
Actually I have 101 movies to see before you die 😅 Brilliant again!
Oh my Gosh lol I just got the liquor joke! Lol I also think my favorite part was the rug and the doormat
Genius
Arch-i-tecture. 😂
😅😂😅
The costumes. The costumes are everything.
Poor Rug...people just walk all over him
Love ikea & sofa bed  ! 🎉 thanks for coming to NZ I’m still doubled over you guys are hilarious - keep on making folk smile 😅
I've been binge watching your videos, I just found you a few days ago. Besides the weekend, Thursday is now my favorite day of the week. 🤣👏🏻
Superb, thanks you guys. Enjoy NZ.
I'm guessing Coatrack never made it past the hall.
Most Irish ppl know at least one lad like Garden Chair...
Was Archi-tecutre a pun on Archies comics and architecture? 😂 If so, nice one
Can someone please explain the joke behind "there's a skip in the front" and garden chair needing to hide? 😊
Hog's hair as doormat just looks like a doormat 😂 Great attention to detail lads!
I will not be able to look at the cocktail cabinet the same way again 😂 Loved it!
Hotel Nightstand outta nowhere
So coffee table is the guy from the cinema..
This is genius. So many laughs. I loved how Coffee Table flounced out when the coaster wasn't on offer.
Amazing!
please include more bloopers!
What does "There's a skip out the front" mean at 1:49?
"At least I can hold my liquor," great line!
haaaaaa m doo darrrrrrr   Next one bean bag chair and folding chair commiserating that they aren't loved or respected, reclining sofa arguing with bed, Dining table vs breakfast nook, toilet mat and bath mat, overhead fluorescent light vs candle and LED. These videos are so great thanks for the laughs.
what a glorious doom-dah!!
that one guy in the audience had a real deep daaa at the end there
Oh no, he's opening up, nope it's too hard for him.  Sofabed must become a new insult 😁
First, FAH gave us Chairheads - now, a whole house-party of furniture characters!  A snobbish heirloom Bookcase lording it over a fresh-faced IKEA wardrobe; Coffee Table insisting on a coaster for protection; the cruel ostracism of Sofa Bed by Bed and Sofa (reminiscent of Tomato's fate); gloomy moss-covered Garden Chair - and loads of puns - it's all so funny!
The coaster thing did me in 😂
This was even more fun reading the captions :). Those fancy furniture...really know the authors..."Stienbeck" instead of "Steinbeck" ;).
I was laughing while lying on the sofabed and I can say that everything about it is completely true. I hate it, it's terrible as a sofa, it's terrible as a bed 🤣
How mean of Rug to speak of doormats in such a way...I bet Doormat is top quality from Matt's Warehouse!
Ahhh! I wish I was still at home in NZ!  Missing your show here in Switzerland :(
Brilliant, truly perfect 🎉🎉🎉
- Well read! - Well observed! Oh I see what you did there 😁
plot twist - bookcase is actually from IKEA too
Thumbs-up for the live doomdah
Brilliant! 😂😂😂
Absolutely fantastic.
Here's the dialogue from the party where the Garden Chair and Armchair first met:  Garden Chair: "Ye know there's a grand ol' world out there, adventures just waitin' to be had! I dare ye to give it a whirl!"  Armchair: "I must kindly decline your proposition, young lad. I find comfort and satisfaction in experiencing the wonders of this vast universe safely nestled within my cozy cushions."  Garden Chair: "Right, right, maybe it's fer the best... Yer posh arse probably couldn't handle it anyhow."  Armchair: "For your information, my comfy bottom is covered in a remarkably durable fabric that has supported the armchair adventures of three generations of besserwissers."  Garden Chair: "Oh, I don't doubt it, but there's a whole wide world beyond the pages of books and the stories ye hear. Ye can't truly grasp the beauty of nature or the thrill of an adventure without feelin' it firsthand."  Armchair: "Your point is valid, however, I offer a safe haven for those who prefer to explore the world through the limitless realm of their imagination. I believe my contributions hold significant value in their own way."  Garden Chair: "Sure, I'll give ye that. But imagine the joy of feelin' the sun on yer cushions or the breeze gently rockin' ye. Life's not all about stayin' indoors, don't ye think?"  Armchair: "I understand the appeal you describe, but I know my role. I find contentment in providing comfort and support to those who seek solace in my warm embrace. We each have our unique purposes to fulfill, wouldn't you agree?"  Garden Chair: "Absolutely. I s'pose we just have different views on what makes life worth livin'. There's enough room in this world for both our ways."  Armchair: "Indeed, we complement each other quite well. While you inspire individuals to embrace the great outdoors and seize life with enthusiasm, I provide them with a comfortable space to relax and reflect on their many experiences."  Garden Chair: "Well said. How 'bout a pint, me posh mate? It might help loosen up those fancy cushions o' yers!""  Armchair: "Thank you for the offer, but I must decline. Warm beer-like beverages simply don't agree with my refined sensibilities."  Garden Chair: "...Yer lost."
DO YOU HAVE A COASTER?!!!!!! ;-)
Ar - chi - texture!!!
I wish I could get invited to one of those parties, but alas, I am just a flip flop and there are no parties for footwear.
OMG the doormat and the rug! LOL
Missed opportunity: Arms should’ve played the Armchair.
Rug❤😂
Omgg you guys are in New Zealand and I missed you noooo 😿💞
"Newlyweds" !!!!!!!! Bwaaaaaaaaa
This video was extra great today!
What does skip mean? 1:49
As a bookworm,  I absolutely loved  bookcase's "get-up".❤ Next could be - Hard/soft drinks throw a party.😅
0:59 never heard architecture pronounced that way haahha
Anybody else upon looking at "Coffee Table" thought about Daniel Radcliffe, or is it just me?
Their cocktail parties are the wittiest.
Ah jeasus lads, ye are brilliant
I loved the video but it feels a little bit unoriginal. No hate ❤
The ‘at least I can hold my liquor’ line is 👨🏻‍🍳👌🏻
________ Throws a Party are by far my favourite videos ye do!
Okay but coffee table going from “well read” to “101 movies to see before you die.” Is way too real.
If you jet spray Garden Chair he'll be as good as new.
I see I have to watch this a few times to catch all of the details. I don't mind. SO much fun. xoxoxo
I was at your Auckland show! So much fun - my sides ached from laughing. I hope you got to try some of the Vogel’s bread afterwards. Please come back again soon.
Sofabed = Xennial.
Poor doormat lol
Silly, funny without crudity and vulgarity.
Sofabed was on point
It was the coaster that really made me laugh.
Full steam ahead lads! You’re the best comedy going right now! Thank you! 💋💋💋
Arm chair & garden meeting is impossible. People would do with sofabed & dining chairs if they need extra sittings but will never bring garden chair inside the house🤣😭
♥️❤♥️❤♥️❤♥️❤♥️❤♥️❤♥️❤♥️❤♥️
They should do silverware & dishes next!
Commenting 4 algorithm
Great idea, great work 🛏🪑🛋👌😂😂
Sofabed should be morbidly obese. They're so heavy.
The way Wardrobe answers Bookcase's questions is exactly the way I behave when I leave Prague and I'm asked where I'm from. 😄🤦🏼‍♀️ (Classic stereotype of being hated for coming from the biggest city in the country. I'm not saying I blame anyone.)
Thanks for sharing your gift🎉. It's refreshing to see clever and gifted people who obviously enjoy what their doing. Thanks again for all of your hard work.🎉🙏
Nobody got tomato'd this time though!
How dare the Coctail Cabinet copy my look??? I, too, can hold my liquor quite well.
A classic, on paper it shouldn't work 😊😊😊😊
I was offended for doormat, that was rude af. 😂😂😂
What happens to the dining table? Hungover before the party?
For my fellow Americans (and others not used to British English), apparently a "skip" is a large container for throwing away trash, often used for larger items (like a raggedy old garden chair).
😅 love the bottle of Slane whiskey... my favorite too... 😊
shout out to  the rug! great shirt!
Trippers 😅
I was waiting for the drawer to stop by and show off his collection of batteries, lightbulbs, old foreign currency and instruction manuals.
Oh coffee table, but WHYYY, you looked great together :)))
The flirt between the coffee table and the cocktail cabinet was great!!  Great party!
Yeah to writers, performers, costume depts and editors. Thanks for leaving in the blooper. You guys rock-er!
Bookcase and coffee table = stewie and Brian Griffin
"At least I can hold my liquor" 😂 That one really got me!
Clever as always, lads. Hope you enjoy a bit of time off after your big tour!
I can't get enough of these party videos!
I thought that the flirting was rather real 😁
Really funny, guys! The costuming was so perfect for each piece! Poor sofabed. 😂
You guys are so clever!
💚☘️🇮🇪☘️🇮🇪☘️🇮🇪☘️🇮🇪☘️🇮🇪☘️🇮🇪💚
A coaster really is a deal-breaker. I feel so bad for sofa bed, but I guess he can go commiserate with his mother IKEA. There are so many good lines in this one, lads. I also see you're amortizing those women's jumpers. 😉
Well at least I can hold my liquor 😂😂😂😂😂
Those party sketches are just getting better and better.
The rug and doormat...good thing pot and pan are not furniture. 😂
Sofabed opening up had me in stitches.
This is an absolute outrage and sofabed doesn't deserve this slander. He's efficient, flexible and space saving, unlike sofa and bed who just lounge around all day doing doing nothing but take up space. They think they are above everyone else for being so cushy, but not everyone gets the privilege to prioritize such lofty ideals as comfort. Those of us that have to sacrifice comfort to get the job done are the ones keeping things together. If it wasn't for sofabed, dining table, coffee table and desk would've been lost years ago.   Of course the one time sofa and bed get replaced they lash out at sofabed like he's the one at fault here when we all know who really caused this. Maybe if sofa and bed held their own weight around here and stopped such wasting precious resources on comfort, then they would have never been replaced in the first place.
Use a bloody coaster on your soft wood coffee table people it's not that hard!
Hahahah you guys are so creative. This is a pearl, as we say in Brazil
At least I can hold my liquor 😂😂😂😂
How do they know exactly how each one should look??? I love the rug!!
Absolutely brilliant lads!
Brilliant! As usual!
THAT'S DIFINITELYY AGAIN ONE OF YOUR MASTERPIECES AGAIN LOL. CAN HARDLY TYPE
As if ppl only have Sex after they're married 😅🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I suppose it would be passé for the coffee table to be reading A Brief History of Time.
I wish we'd se "alcohol has a party" featuring sherry, beer and selection of fine wines.
I'm sorry but this one was not believable. The bookcase should also come from Sweden, and be nicknamed Billy.
This one was so well-written. Top job, as usual! 😄
'Oh no, he's opening up' & 'repeating the same patterns'. I laughed so hard. Genius work!
Bookcase cracked me up lol.
So excellent !!!😂😂😂👏👏👏
That ending😂😂😂😂
the outfits are ON POINT
Haha
Nice touch to subtly mispronounce 'architecture'.
Your best party video yet!
Soo good!  Sofabed getting rinsed was pure gold!!
Sofabeds eventual meltdown at a party was somehow relatable 🤨
Definitely one of your better ones, guys. 👍 Garden chair having to lie low was genius!
Why did I read this as  your future throws a party 🥲
No kitchen table identity crisis!
"Have you got a coaster?" So many layers to that one,!
nice choice slane is a good whiskey
I don't get why Bookcase snubbed Wardrobe, isn't he a 'self-made' man?
I'm imagining dining table and sofa having an argument about proper dinner etiquette.
Just me or does Coffee table say artitecture?  That transition from laughing to 'do you have a coaster' though 😂😂😂
Easily the best series
The word of god. The thick book. Was that Lord of the rings?
I... I like the 80s identity crisis...
There should be a dinner table in there somewhere. There could be a stool who’s armchairs annoying little brother that he had to bring. Also, all of the sex furniture is currently getting it on in the bedroom.
Fuck me if I didn't hear the clearly Kiwi accent of the crowd lol, might just be cos attuned to it but defo there
Hog looks like Andy Warhol with that silver grey wig. Great video, greetings from Sweden (aka Ikea)
He's opening up, nope it's too difficult 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
There's so much potential in this series! I enjoy all of them! Something magical lies in the objects party... maybe the costumes? Those are on point!
Literally said to myself - furniture?! What will they think of next! Cocktail cabinet and coffee table was pas particularly stellar
Ah lads!! Quality as usual!
Cocktail Cabinet and Rug costumes were fantastic.
Favourite world of personificated objects created by FAH! It's really great how you you draw parallel with humans, choose recognizable details (hotel nightstand and the Bible, sofabed inner conflict etc) and make the audience feel this ot that towards characters. Props and costumes are perfect as usual! I enjoyed the video, it's very funny! 🎉
Omg! This is tooo much! I love it!
Welcome to Aotearoa boys, thanks for coming over 😊
Flirty cocktail cabinet is all I needed on this cold and hectic Thursday. No, I do not have a drinking problem.
0:58 if it ain't ye olde goode le snobbe 😂
Coaster joke... amazing
"you must be so well read" and "at least i can hold my liqueur" are such good lines!
Rug: I keep repeating the same PATTERN OVER AND OVER again.  kudos to writing
You're good for my mental health ❤
Do you have a coaster? No. *leaves* 💀💀💀
Sofabed: I am actually having a real tough time  Sofa: oh no he is opening up Bed: don't think so it's too difficult for him GOLD
these sketches are my favourite i think :D
Love the way you play with the language. So difficult to pick a favourite line or a character or an outfit.. every single one is a gem. Having said so, you just nail the identity crisis characters. Thanks again for making our days brighter!
Party sketch never dissapoints
"a rough winter" I lost it 😂😂
Giving the Jacob Collier audience a run for their money there, New Zealand!
My table from IKEA with two of its legs converted into scratching posts says hello. I just covered them in duct tape and wrapped it in some rope. The IKEA bookcases would also say hello, but they are falling apart.
Nice, I like the variety and creativity of the jokes for this series!
Brilliant 😂😂😂😂
Favourite 1980s identity crisis 😂😂😂😂
Bookcase's inability to tie a tie is quite funny
The music! 😂👍 The dinner party detectives would be glad that there at least was some. 😂
Thanks, this was just what I needed!
You know Arms, the keyframing you've been doing on the graphics lately when characters duck down or sidle across the screen makes me giggle so much 😄
Hog as the armchair - wearing Arms' classic floral jacket!  👍🔥 Last seen, I believe, on Arms as the STI in the Other Diseases Are Angry sketch.
Thanks for coming to see us in NZ! Loved you guys 😍
what are you talking about? 101 movies to see before you die is an absolute classic! i will not tolerate this slander! /s
Love this party concept please make videos on Rooms,vehicles,gadgets & food items.
Nice to see the women's jumpers getting some more use 🤣
My favourite type of sketches you guys write, these always make my day!  With so much material I hope you never stop making these. One day I hope you make one with the planets in our solar system 😁
“You must be so well read?” “Well observed” that’s so clever for the coffee table 😂
I always like the 'party' sketches but this one might be the best so far. So many laugh-out-loud moments.
"You're too soft." Broke me. Thank you: Laughter really is the best medicine... sometimes.
Truly the best performers.  Please, Please, Pease come to Arizona on your next trip to the states 🙏
What on earth a hotel nightstand is doing in a home? I confused myself by assuming this the secret life of my my furnitures’ when i am not home.
Me seeing the title: There's no way that lads would convincingly dress up as a home furniture.  Foil, Arms and Hog: Hold my Guinness.
"O-oh, he's opening up." "Don't think so, it's too difficult for him!" 🤣
"Do you have a coaster? No." I'm dead. 🤣🤣
You made me care about furniture, well done lads.
I think this whole sketch was written to be a home for the sofabed joke. Good call.
Ar-chi-tecture 😂
Great sketch, but far more :D to have been in the crowd shot. Thanks for coming here, you guys were great live! :)
Now I feel bad for the SofaBed
Good to see you are home safely.
Did you guys get the gold bar in the end ? (Just saw you guys at the nz show)
Brilliant as always lads, thanks.
You are great!!
Hhhhhh
Brilliant!😂😂
holy crap howd you get the whole of new zealand in a room
Not nearly enough recignition being given for the "Well observed" line. Three-way pun going straight under the radar
2:05 Cocktail Cabinet “well at least I can hold my liquor”  Clever double meaning!
Question: Did you buy the red cups in the hundreds or is it always the same three? ^^ They keep reappearing in different videos as easter eggs! :D
😂
The garden chair part was hilarious! Good skit all around!
This is definitely missing the desk coming in all high and mighty because that's where 'he' spends 80% of his time anyway.
I feel so sorry for sofabed  ...The things FAH makes you say
I've had a "bookshelf- coffee table" discussion recently. An older colleague of mine was talking to me about some classic novel "And of course, you've read that book,..." Me: "ermmm. Yea.. I know I have it somewhere. It's by ermm"   Not a very comfortable experience.
You are great as always i enjoy watching you
My coffee table wouldn't be dressed like this or acted that way. It would carry two cats and a bunch of tabletop games. :D
"At least I can hold my liquor"  😂
love it just got a new Sofa perfect timing for the video :D
Well read, well observed 😂
You'll note, they invited Bar Fridge, but he was far too cool to show up.
I couldn't understand the last joke of armchair and garden chair can someone explaim
Stacked with brilliant lines 😂 absolutely love it!!
I love how quickly that mustard turtleneck has entered the pantheon of iconic FAH costumes. Has Foil taken a liking to it? (It does suit him.)
Can't belive nobody told rug not to let people walk all over them... :D I love these sketches so much!
Coffee Table is so relatable
These party sketches are so good. The costuming is just brilliant on this. Love the cocktail cabinet flirting with the coffee table, the rug crying to the doormat and lawnchair and armchair interactions 😂
You guys are just plain brilliant!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!¨
garden chair trying to dodge the skip, so funny, that was brilliant lads
Brilliant - as ever! Loved the "do you have a coaster?"
Well that's a nice surprise that the outro was from a show in New Zealand, I hope you all enjoyed your time here.
And Arms, explain the last second of the sketch? Was the character laughing or was it you? 😊😊😊
Elliptical machine: Hi guys, i'm with you! Other: But you are not furniture! Elliptical machine Come on, I had more clothes hanging on me than in the wardrobe!
Garden chair FTW! "It was a rough winter." killed me right off the bat. 😂😂😂
1:42 In case you don't know the Bible inside the drawer is meant to dissuade men from spanking the monkey in bed. It's like: "Jesus is watching you"
Poor Arm, always being bullied while throwing party
Thx for being silly.
Sofabed should be honored, not shunned. A great middle ground for a guest.  I even have the next evolutionary step at home: armchairbed.
"oh, he's opening up"  "no don't think so--it's too difficult for him"  GENIUS
You guys are geniuses! I love how bookcase's hair makes it look like there are layers and wisps of dust in top! Welcome home! Can't wait for a livestream report on your AU NZ tour! 👍👍👍👍
He can't hold his liquor. 😁
Brilliant!
Great job on the costumes, too! I especially love Cocktail Cabinet, Bookcase and Coffee Table!
Oh, he's opening up! - Don't think so, t's too difficult for him. I LOVED that.
Ahh, yes the sofa bed. It’s not a bed and it’s Not a sofa! It’s a horrid place to put the in laws .
Awesome crowd in Wellington!! We even put on the wind for them. It was good to see so many fans at the Opera House. I meet some lovely ladies who queued with me to the meet the fine Irish chaps.
Love it! The wordplay had me cracking up several times :D! Poor sofabed
The hotel nightstand is a Jehovahs witnes. 😂
There's also a French periodical on the coffee table: "La Guide du RTE..."
Just class lads👍🏻
"At least I can hold my liquor" 🤣  Simply brilliant as usual.
Sometimes I forget that its actually the same 3 people. Sending my wishes to the garden chair. really cracked me up :P.
What a doomdah!! Love the crack up at the end
I work in a hotel and laughed so hard at the hotel nightstand!
rug: “I keep repeating the same patterns over and over” 😂
At least I can hold my liqueur.
Haha love it lads 😂 I hope you made it home safely 💕
I was disappointed to not see a desk, but I suppose they tabled that for the office party.
Great stuff as Always! I would have loved to see coffee table and cocktail cabinet with reverse genders... drinks come out of the cabinet and go on the table..
Sofabed was amazing!
Here's some appreciation for garden chair 👏😂
Was waiting for the dog to get kicked off the bed...😊
"Yeah, well, atleast I can hold my liquor." YOU ARE THE GODS OF PUNS😂
Thursday mornings are my favourite of the week, thanks to you three geniuses!
This should go viral….classic
Oh! Really! How did I miss the New Zealand tour! Gutted! Let me know if you ever come back.
I feel really bad for "Sofabed", "Bed" and "Sofa" giving him a very hard time
There’s nothing better than waking up on a Thursday morning to the smell of coffee… and another fab addition to the party sketch portfolio! They look like a blast to film 😂👌
Just glad no reference to a STOOL sample 😂
Brilliant concept and well done
How do you do it ??? 😂  ...hold on I must watch it again 😂
Shit it’s Thursday already
Lads, I have a question.. are costume selections a part of the writing process in these party sketches, or you just brilliantly sum these up as you keep shooting? Just brilliant costumes.. 🤩
Chemistry between Cocktail Cabinet and Coffee Table... before a coaster :D  I'm in love with your thematic costumes, always so spot on ♥
oh look the snob disguised himself as a coffee table!
Coctail Cabinet flirting with Coffee Table is just hilarious! 😂😂😂 Coffee Table is way too sensitive if it cannot have a drink without a coaster, though 😁
Every "things throw a party/ go to therapy/ etc" episode is a pure holiday for me. Love you guys!
Fahntastic Statistic  Today's sketch marks the 11th Party sketch from Foil Arms and Hog. In 2018, 'Days of the Week' was the first party sketch. It took almost 2 years for 'Months of the Year' to follow. There were loads of party sketches in 2020 and 2021 since FAH couldn't gig during lockdown. After a two-year hiatus, the Party sketches returned in January, with 'Energy sources throwing a party'.
Awesome work on the thumbnail
Happy Thursday FAH fam
Liquor cabinet is the real love of everyone's life.. 😆
First class!! You've absolutely mastered this sketch format and the costumes are perfection 🤩🤩🤩  oh and a huge shoutout to Mr. Editing, flawless flow and delicious soundtrack ❤❤  Love how versatile the Snob character has become 😂 he should get a cameo in as many sketches as possible!!
Is Sofabed the new Tomato in the group? 🤣🤣
next..expect some display furniture just poping in till after the house auction or for the display home!
Hehe! Loved bookcase and coffee table. And sofabed being an identity crisis 😂 Hog must've made up the 100 movies line on the spot
The parties are the best!! Love these guys. When you coming to Alaska?
You Are Brilliant!!!  and one watch is never enough... there's no way one may want to miss any of your wit Thanks guys ♥♥♥
Hey Liqour cabinet, you are indeed hot!! 😉
Loved it ❤😂😂
Do you have a coaster 😂😂 I’m dead   👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 standing ovation… love every sketch you put out but I adore this style…so many jokes so many puns.
Brilliant party, as always! 😂👏 Was rather hoping for Matt Matterson to show up and kidnap Doormat for his warehouse at the end though! 😝
Typical, I spend months waiting for the daylight savings to change so the sketch doesn't come out precisely at dinnertime, then when it actually happens I completely miss it! 😂 Brilliant work as ever lads, far too many great moments for me to mention, but I feel like I may have been a Rug at some times in my life, so my apologies to any Doormats I might have upset. It was brilliant seeing you lads over in the Water Hemisphere, here's hoping you come back again within the decade 💖
Garden Chair and Gaming Chair are just not cool enough. They're just not Rocking Chairs.
Amazing! Coffee table is a surprisingly skeezy but the exchange between him and cocktail cabinet was absolutely hilarious. I think garden chair was my favourite... I feel you, man.
could do with a multitasker rn - am surrounded by judgemental looking flatpacks waiting to be assembled for weeks while waiting for yet another ikea delivery. i didn't even know flatpacks could look judgemental, so thanks for making me paranoid🤯
Was not expecting a party sketch today!! Absolutely brilliant! The characters, costumes, lines, everything was just amazing! So glad that Australia and New Zealand went well.
It's great knowing that your own material makes you laugh as well,  enough to break character even. 10/10 on the costumes again for this one
I was really expecting to hear rug say he really tied the room together...
Foil is a fabulous cocktail cabinet! 🍭🍹🍸
😂😂😂😂
Yes, another party sketch! 😊 I don't have every furniture that is mentioned in sketch, but can imagine what is their function through the jokes. I feel sorry for Sofabed with his identity crisis, he was just trying to be multifunctional. Also, loved the part about Doormat, that was savage. 😂🤣
I love the party sketches! 😂 They might be silly and not the hardest to write (for yous-i couldn't do it), but they're seriously good fun!
I will do anything to see a before and after photo of the costume room for any party sketch like this!!! 🤩 Brilliant..
The cocktail cabin though! So good!! 😂
Coffee Table 🤣🤣 Snobby show-off to those he sees as beneath himself then Bookcase shows him up 😂😂
that was great hope you had a fab time in New Zealand ❤🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
Bookcase and gran should never be in the same room 😅😅
0:22 most of my furniture comes from IKEA it's not that big of a deal
That was hilarious! Cocktail Cabinet especially was a treat to hear! (But I gotta be that guy, the subs spelled Steinbeck wrong.)
OK you've got 40 hours to surprise us with New Zealand Immigration or I owe Sam a pack of Penguins. Just saying.  And staring meaningfully. And looking up the cost of postage nervously.
These outfits are on point, lads! The costume dept is going all in 🎉❤
I love all these costumes, very accurate again And do I spot Hog wearing sti's jacket?
"Newlyweds" 😆🤣🤣 Love Foil as the cocktail cabinet, haven't seen that jacket in a loong time.  Get some rest, guys, you deserve it!
Sofabeds arent that bad guys! I mean there not great either but still. Felt bad for Sofabed.
Oh, Cocktail Cabinet, you look just FABULOUS! You absolutely must tell me where you shop and who your hair stylist is. Such exquisite taste! Bookcase looked quite dashing too.  Aw, you guys are the best! ❤ Love your 'party' skits! The one with food in the fridge - can't even remember how many times I've gone back and re-watched that one and will continue doing so as it'll never get old.
Half asleep I actually read 'your future throws a party', which had me slightly confused.
I was so hoping for my first ever sketch premiere in the air... but there was no available Wi-Fi on this NZ-Oz leg 😭 If the plane was on time I would have made it, but we were a good 10 minutes late touching down. If I was a child I would probably kick the seat in front of me in frustration
This is hysterical 🤣🤣🤣 And I love all the familiar costumes! Didn't realise La Bullshat was renting out his jacket! Too many jokes I loved to go through tbh. I loved them all!  No wayyy look at me writing about something other than Hogwash! I'm so proud of myse-anyway speaking of Hogwash... How much freaking fun is that show 🤣🤣🤣 Thanks so much again for coming. Had THE time of my life!!! Don't take too long to come back, you hear?!  And, just... keep in mind you got TWO standing ovations in NZ. Sure that's not many but technically, it's 100% of the time... hehehe 😉  And Armsy, that note on the back of your last poster meant a hell of a lot to me. Thank you so much for that 🥺
Just how many turtlenecks did you buy!? Are there any left in Dublin?
I had to look up "cocktail cabinet" just to make sure I was thinking the same thing.  I've only known it to be called a "cabinet" or "drinks cabinet" but yeah, throwback to 70s living rooms there.  I see Foil is back playing a woman for the first time in a very long while! Edited to add that I only just saw that mention of the 1,000 movies book you mentioned on Patreon!
2:29 Hog breaking character >>>>>>>>>>>>>>
And once again poor waterbed and beanbag chair get ignored
I don't completely understand the friendship between Armchair and Garden Chair, but I enjoy it! Where did they meet? A really big party where they needed to bring chairs from outside? Does Garden Chair tell tales of an outside world Armchair will never experience? I feel like their friendship has lasted many years.
I’m sure there were meatballs outside of the party trying to break in. Somehow they started to think they have a strong relationship with furniture, so they’re a bit clingy… hahahaha, great sketch, lads!!
2:11 Instant Red Flag if you like Hemingway or Jack Kerouac. I don’t make the rules.  2:14 (lifts up glasses) It’s ‘Steinbeck’ FYI.
I like how the wardrobe didn’t admit he was from IKEA until he had to, but I  also love how the teak bookshelf didn’t stop pressing the matter. Brilliant 😂
I love the party sketches. Great costumes ( I keep looking for turtlenecks in colours we haven't seen before), great acting and so so many clever lines. Have to watch it again a few more time to catch them all. Have a wonderful day.
That waas hilarious... 😍
Loved it! So well written, and the costumes! 😁 Garden Chair is great, but Cocktail Cabinet, you guys, trully awesome.🎉👏🏾💖
This time, you've really gone over and beyond on the costumes; especially how Sofabed is dressed as a cross between Sofa and Bed!  I really love the snobbiness of Bookcase over the IKEA wardrobe, and the granny wig is back! So many things I love in it, I would comment on the whole video here!  Excellent sketch as always! 😀👏
1:23 Gaming Chair is the hottest of them all 🔥
The perfect response to someone saying they don’t have coasters is to leave. Well done! 👏🏽 (proceeds to sip coffee and leave it on the table)
As an actual multi-Tasker, good to check get a name check in todays sketch, thanks lads 😆 (PS, we don’t do everything badly)
I misread the title as furniture to sleep on😂 fab lines!!!
You have been really spoiling us with all these parties of late! Considering how time-consuming you've always said they are to film, too. Have you refined your technique to speed it up, it did you just not sleep for weeks in the run-up to travelling!?
I don’t know which line in this I like the most 😂
I have to say, Arms was the best with sofa bed and rug! Another great one overall!
I appreciate the level of detail in poor sofa beds’ outfit - cream to match bed and a hint of tartan to match sofa. Nicely done. Also, who doesn’t love a judgemental bookcase? Great work!
Garden chair, what a state!!! I will look differently at outdoor chairs from now on, they do have a rough time out there 😅
1:09 The Cocktail Cabinet is well lit here 🔥
Was expecting either a blooper compilation or a snippet from a live show, but this was a lovely surprise. Great job lads! Hope y'all had a wonderful tour down under and please get some rest and take care of yourselves :)
1:03 Great job with the character of the Coffee Table. Although I’m sure the books are feeling left out.
The clothes are all so spot on
Multi-tasker? You called? How can me and Claire help?
I'll never grow tired of the party series 😍 But just say architecture one more time there coffee table, I didn't quite catch that...
Loved the video lads and I loved watching you live even more…if I am being honest, you guys could be comedians!
"If it's not our favorite 1980's identity crisis" 🤣
😂 Excellent sketch. That's some jacket that sofa bed is wearing. Hope you had an amazing time and have a good rest! Best of luck 😊
101 movies to see before you die....so true
cocktail cabinet and coffee table need to get a room.
These party videos are literally the best!!!! And all the costumes match perfectly!!! You guys rly are masters of ur craft
Costume department doing some of their best work here. I think I am in love with cocktail cabinet 😮 * Stands up and claps *
I feel sorry for Doormat. Everyone just walks all over him.
At least I can hold my liquor 😂
Did the garden chair survive without being thrown in the skip?🤣
These jokes are so clever and spot on!! You three can even make furniture funny!!! I love it!
0:41 You can be slanderous to Sofabed but wait till you hear from his father, Murphy. He doesn’t take any prisoners.
Good morning from the Irish Sea! Grabbed a couple of minutes of this ferry's wifi to say hi, and hope you had a pleasant journey home. I'm certainly enjoying this one, sipping a cuppa, looking at the waves, and getting a good laugh from your sketch! See you soon!
Bed thought he had it rough while Gaming Chair was all proud of 36hours nonstop activity
I hope you had a wonderful time on your Antipodean Tour. I certainly had a lovely time living vicariously through my FAHriends Down Under, plus persuading a couple of Antipodeans I vaguely knew online at some point in the past that they should check you out. I'm pleased to report that neither of them are mad they took my recommendation.  Now I hope you're able to get some good rest in. Here's an idea - nip into the office on Monday, bang out something really quick, a one shot wonder, then take off until after Easter. I'm sure you could think of something. Like, I dunno, New Zealand immigration? 🤔
Amazing! Another one with this kind of set up. You're so good at them and I bloody love them! I did not realise there was so much tension between furniture. So my house isn't the only hodgepodge...
Jared the carrot front and centre! 😂
All my bookcases are from Argos so I don't think they're as sophisticated as yours is! Thanks for the laughs lads!
Well observed, lads. If yoy really don't want to read the book, put it on the coffee table and it disappears into the void. It's like a cemetry of books.
I have to say, Bookcase might be a snob, but his suit. is. MAGNIFICENT!🤩😎👌
The bookshelf should have been from Ikea and called Billy.
How do you come up with something as brilliant as this, guys? Let me say this in Hindi - आपके चरण कहां हैं प्रभु।'
0:22 The Yellow Turtleneck has become part of the channel 🔥
So Arms, how does it feel now that people have found out you're not as tall as you say you are? Maybe time to find another excuse for clumsiness?😛  (*imitates lasers* pow, pow, pow, I'm back! Thank you, thank you, I'll be here all night!)
Were this my place, the furniture would all miraculously discover they're related by large white IKEA labels somewhere on them. Great stuff again guys!
0:16 As someone who adores bookcases, I’m here for Sir Teak Wigglesworth IV 😂  P.S. It hurts me to see wigs not being taken care of.
"he's opening up" 😂 🛋️🛏️  Tbh, Cocktail Cabinet is the best!
Hahahaha 🤣🤣🤣 I Love throw a party sketches !!! Arms ..you missed a trick ..you didn't mean COD for the game chair ..you mean PUBG ..hehehe 😊🎉 great sketch lads!!!
It felt like Hog was constantly about to break character and burst into laughter😂 That tells me how fun it must have been to film. Excellent one, lads!
Loved the interaction between the cocktail cabinet and the coffee table - " you must be so well read". The words, the costumes, the delivery, all fabulous.
Where did you get that perfect jacket for sofabed from? :D  I love the costumes of all the characters, so spot on!
Bookcase and Coffee Table, two snobs together. 🧐🧐 Brilliant sketch, lads!
I can't get over Foil as a cocktail cabinet...hilarious! xD
Making full use of those jumpers, are we? 😂 I do love your Party Sketches, lads. Uhm, Arms, what’s up with the sexy background music? 😅 I learned something though: NEVER treat rug like a doormat 😂
never failed to put a smile on my face 😂😂😂😂😂💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙
I love these ‘Throw a party’ videos. They are so cleverly written. 😉👍🏼
Of course coffee table refuses any advance that doesn't have protection
Name a more iconic duo than bed and sofa
Just a reminder that I came across the ‘Regional Accent Discrimination’ Sketch and “Mister Frodo, Mister Frodo, I don’t want to go te Morrdorr.” lives rent-free in my head.
Brilliant sketch! Hope you enjoyed your time down under! ❤❤
Poor Sofabed 😂. Love the detail that the pattern inside of the coat is similar to Sofas blanket.
Sofa-bed opening up (or not) hahahaha
Guten Morgen Arms! 🌦️ Du bist hoffentlich nicht hier heute, sondern schläfst noch! 😉 Aber falls du doch da bist: ich hoffe ihr hattet eine gute Zeit in Australien und Neuseeland - es sah nach viel Spaß aus. Danke für die vielen Patreon-Videos, so konnten wir wenigstens ein bisschen dabei sein auf eurer Reise, das war toll! 😍 Ich freu mich, euch in 4 Wochen auch endlich wieder zu sehen! 😊
Excellent. Such clever comedy.
Oh no.
Hey Arms are you there? Safe trip home? Anyway have a good rest lads!
I've always loved the party sketches but they keep getting better and better! The costumes are just out of this world, you must have great fun getting them together 😊 Also, finally watching at 8 am again, i can't believe it!!
I watched your show last week and it was amazing thanks for coming to Australia 😄
The thought that went into wardrobe's wardrobe 😂👍🏼
What part of Sweden -IKEA😂
Top job lads as usual
This is just my 8 o' clock alarm
Funny sketch lads 😂👍
Guten Morgen! :) Seid ihr gut nach Hause gekommen? Wie kommt ihr mit den Zeitzonen klar?  Ich bin schon seit der Umstellung auf Sommerzeit (um nur 1 Stunde vor!) letzten Sonntag schrecklich müde und es wird jeden Tag schlimmer...
Yeeooo
Oh lads! As you sit there today, tired and jet lagged from your mammoth trip home, I just want to say what an absolute joy it was to meet you and to thank you (once again!) for coming to these wee rocks on the other side of the world.  The shows & our times together will remain very treasured memories, and hopefully more can be made in the not-toooooo-distant-future  ~ Charlotte 🌸
Another fine addition to the party collection
Yay, what a great start into an otherwise dreary day! Plus: the theatre tours on patreon were great! It was almost surreal seeing Foil’s shorts (and yours) in their natural habitat while we had a snowstorm outside. I didn’t think you’d find the time to show us around, so thank you for that, I really enjoyed meeting the ladder family, the horrible plum, the tiny doors and the terrifying balcony!
First?
