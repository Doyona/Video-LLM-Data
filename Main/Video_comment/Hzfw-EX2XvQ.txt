the shepherd's English sounds like German, actually. most English spoken in Northern England sounds really close to German.
I like how the old man is also sort of giving instructions on how to steal sheep.😂
HORROR MOVIES YA BLUNT KNOB!
is he ok. Homie are you ok? This looks distressing xD
I'm not gonna lie, it makes me super fuckin happy that you gave Brad Pitt in Snatch the seal of approval.   That movie is amazing.  Ironically, the farmer talking in that video talking about the dog, I can understand with 100% clarity - as an American; the Rowers too.
Creole in the US is probably the equivalent to this.
Isn’t Brad Pitts character supposed to be impossible to understand?
I’m Irish, and I can’t understand his accent and I can do a Irish accent and myself
That shepherd is great, because sometimes I'll hear English and sometimes I will hear Swedish Chef from the Muppets.
For the first movie, _Wild Mountain Thyme_ got a 25% on rotten tomatoes, one of the biggest complaints were the accents lol.
I feel the same as you when Scots are depicted in Hollywood movies. Mel Gibson springs to mind.  😂
Real quick, why is this video in dark mode?😂
Okay German here, this may sound weird but this really is messing with my brain. Not because its hard to understand but because if its simmelaritys to Plattdeutsch. I do understand a lot of Platt but and Im quite good with understanding various accents but THIS is different. It kinda sounds like Plat and so my brain goes in german mode but then remembers its actually english. Its soooo weird.
How many accents does county Kerry have? About the same as the amount of sheep farmers in there.
Slavery is here we work to pay the government back everything they pay us money means nothing
I can't stand most Irish accents, can't half your accents be a bit more subtle like Ronan Keatings? But I do find it is mainly the woman Irish accents I can't stand 😅
Am i the only one that understood what they all said
The only thing more Irish then a Irishmen is a American
I had an Irish coworker once. In person he was easy enough to understand, but he called me a couple of times from the Ireland office and I swear my brain had to reboot because the phone tripled the effect of the accent 😅
after watching the show derry girls i can understand what theyre saying
The human equivalent of sergeant ducky
2:21 nice Arnold Schwarzenegger impression
For some reason, the sheep farmer reminds me of a scene from the Simpsons, where Marge shows Bart a "love postcard" drunk Homer sent her from the Duff Brewery.
I studied abroad in Ireland and the taxi driver I had that drove me to my student accommodations was literally the final boss of the Irish accent. Not the best thing to encounter on two hours of sleep and jet lag. Great guy though!
He SERIOUSLY needed more practice on the accent honestly the more I listened the easier it became to understand them I personally like Scottish accent the best
Thank you for including Derry (not the city) with Frostbit Boy. Too often, the stolen 6 are missed out of "Irish" videos.
The limerick one sounded like Nogla
people with thick irish accents sound like they're speaking in one long word
I remember watching these before dating an Irish man and I couldn't understand a word these guys were saying. Now here I am, 4 years later, having dated a man from Ireland and I can understand everything a whole lot better. 😂
I mean gypsy tongue and farmers have very similar verbal cadences. Think Brad Pitt did it spot on tbf 😂😂
The Brad Pitt accent isn't meant to be authentic, that's the whole point. It's meant to illustrate how off the wall his character is.
Wish he had a full clip him watching the last one
why is sweden on that list, we often sound so confused
How was Scotlish anywhere near the list?
Snatch is a good movie though ❤
brad pitt plays a traveler.  videos of seen of actual travelers,  he nailed it
I understood all of this owing to the fact that I'm from County Yolo in California, ya gaol yer actin the langers lol
Wait until this guy figures out what Newfoundland is 😭
Is it weird that I understand some of this even if I'm not Irish?😂
I feel like the Irish are like our Country folk, The more Irish they are surrounded by the more Irish they become
With the farmers, I actually could understand Richie completely, but I got maybe one or two words out of Mikey.
Cork and Kerry; Indecipherable even to Irish people 😂😂😂
Great rhythm and beat!
Most Americans think the "Irish Accent" is a Dublin accent. If you know that, it explains a lot, lol. All the aspirated consonants
Good journalism!
What about Christopher runnin
This video popped up in my feed. I remember seeing it years ago and that Derry kid absolutely kills me with the frostbit. The Belfast accent is another great one. It's a sing songy Irish accent mixed with a slight dose of threatening.
sean pretty please play dying light the beast
I give credit to Brad Pitt, because they acknowledge the off side of the accent when his character is introduced, "It's not English, it's not Irish, it's just pikey..."
I loved this even being from Newfoundland because theres a lot of similarities just a bit more Canadian with it 😂
You should hear all the different Swedish accents/dialects, some of them are actually not even understandable for me as a native Swedish person haha.
My ancestry is Cork Ireland
I dated a Irish girl in high school loved her voice and then a English girl from England.  I am Irish blood and proud of it
Ok dude that school kid is almost a spitting image of gman from halflife I can't unsee it lmaoooo
15:18 he has a gay accent😂
You need to react to a Newfoundland accent
Frostbet sounds like what I imagine Colm from Derry Girls sounded like when he was a schoolboy
"I don't sound like that" oh baby yes you absolutely do XD
Im american born but i am 7th generation irish. I could understand em all except for the last part if the interview of the shepherd 😂
Christopher Walken trying to do an Irish accent sounds like an Irish person trying to imitate Christopher Walken. Also, I love how he says "him trying to be Irish is the most bizarre thing I've ever heard in my life" as though Walken is not the king of wackadoodles. ALL of his movies are synonymous with the word "bizarre."
The more Irish people I meet the more I realise there's no such thing as an Irish accent - there are dozens of broad accents that are each unique.  Its as silly as saying an English accent - what do you mean, English?  Cornish?  Manc?  Cockney?  West Country?  Brummy?  Scouse?  Geordie?  They are all extremely different, just like with every country.  Someone from Dublin sounds nothing like someone from Cork or Donegal.  And when you get rural, good luck.
sean you should do something like this again, it's so cool to see you react and engage with content of ireland!
0:23, after all these years, I still feel a bit offended
God they all like drunks get me a bottle of Jameson I'll start talkin Irish for ya
I'm Australian and know approximately one Irishman irl, and he is my taekwondo instructor.  Martial arts instructors often have their favourite phrases they say over and over, and as a result I can say certain random phrases in an Irish accent but literally nothing else
You don’t sound like that!
Wild Mountain thyme is one of my favorite songs
12:19 Yeah Sean, it's "AN Irish Accent," not "EVERY Irish Accent"... 😂😂
I actually have a question for you Jack. I know that in another video you spoke fluent Korean, and I know you’re born Irish so what I wanna ask is does any of your family members speak Irish Gaelic? Like I know Ireland has English but they also have their own so I’m asking if your family members spoke it or all of you just spoke English? I’m just curious.
Apparently, the accent started out pretty tame in Snatch, but Brad had a ton of fun pushing it, and Guy Ritchie thought it would be hilarious if nobody could understand the film's mega star, so he egged him on
"It's all pops and whistles from over here"
If Anby Rae LaCombe escapes to Ireland and I'm still here in hell...well that will makes sense because life is fucked
Brad Pitt is speaking newfey, people from Newfoundland Canada. We get it
I'm a newfie (sorta similar accents to irish!) and i could understand most of what the farmer was saying. look up "strong newfoundland accent" and you'll be in for a laugh too
As someone who's lived in South Western England and visited the Midlands, Northern England, and Ireland, most people outside of Europe don't realize that the Irish accent was heavily influenced by a lot of English accents. If you've been to Bristol, England, the accent is very similar
The Irish rowers are from the same place in Ireland as me and I understand them😭
one second: ah it's a promo; next secont: it definetelly ain't no promo
The hardest bit is not the words being used or pronounced its the cadence. It's how one word ends and another starts and it sounds like it ends midway due to the cadence and you think those word and a half are one word.
that farmer was bad but i understood everyone else easily enough
As far as Snatch....Brad Pitt saying "You like dags (dogs)" is still spoken in my house 😂
When is jacksepticeye live
I can just about understand the farmer 😂
As someone with a Midwest accent, it’s amazing seeing the similarities between Irish and the Wisconsin Minnesota accent
5:32 sounds like an anime man...
Can jamaican and irish people understand each other? :)
9:08 I can’t even tell who’s talking because they aren’t moving their lips! 😂
Why does that schoolboy look about 45 years old?? 😮
Funny thing I’m from cork but my Nana’s from Kerry so I almost completely understood the sheep farmer
I follow Adam McIntyre (also Irish) and he says mirror like “murr”
Jacksepticeye: it's like the word Mirror, it's just Mi and 15 R's.... 😂
This reminds me of when in 1000 lb Sisters, they put subtitles for the Slaton sisters because even though they’re speaking English, their Kentucky accents are so thick that some Americans can’t understand them.
auzi women have better accents than anyone lol
5:37  I'm irish and all i hear is druken irish mixed with American type drunken word mixing up
2:25 bro just sound like Arnold Schwarzenegger
In my opinion the most beautiful accent is northern Norwegian. And I'm from Denmark
16:05, I love how Sean is just having a merry ol' time but as soon as he sees the stereotype he helped perpetuate in the video, his smile immediately shifts to shame
"Christopher Walken, Emily Blunt. I know...real strong Irish people." 🤣🤣🤣
Been here 5yrs, guess thats long enough to understand the farmer. 😂
Jack Septic Eye translates,okay I can kinda understand a few words.After the first translation...I'm not even close LOL
I love that you do Christopher Walken better than Christopher Walken can do a basic Irish accent. That's awesome. PMSL.
Let’s do Jacksepticeye try and pronounce H in an American accent
What about southern twang
I feel like Sean would enjoy Louisiana Creole.
I find it funny that youtube subtitles understand this accent like regular english
For some reason I had it in my head that the Dublin accent was the lightest and smoothest of Irish accents. Then I ran into some Northsiders and I thought, "Well, bang goes that theory!" 😂
here I was thinking I finally mastered english.....
Deckard gone Irish
I put cc on when the farmer was talking and all it got was "sheep" and "brione" i know what a sheep is but not a brione 🤷‍♀️
Americans have to do this with southern accents. There are some accents out there in the US that you cant hardly understand either. I dont even try with Cajun.
Are you okay? Brad Pitt is playing an Irish traveller in Snatch, that’s exactly how they sound 🙈
I will rewatch because youtube keeps pushing this to me because I am in the motherland.
4:41 IS THAT BRENDAN FRASER
Hot Fuzz clip with the farmer who had a armory in his shed. I think it was an very thick English accent though. Not Irish. 😉🤣
I think she's aiming far when teaching so the bumbling Americans get on average correct.
Is Celine Dion singing in Irish accent when Celine Dion does concert in Ireland, for the fans?
Just wait until you hear northerners try and say mirror :/
i just realized what a thick irish accent sounds like, it sounds as if the pronunciation hasnt changed since the 1100's
It kinda makes me sad that sean has lost his accent if you know what i mean
I thought the frost bit one was northern irish
19:10 I lost it here 😂😂😂
Looking forward to this  But also I expect that’s everyone trying to do another accent. I can’t tell you how often American accents on the BBC makes me cringe,.. and how often Americans try to do English is no better
17:24 is she british
Im half irish and i can even understand him 4:51
Lost it at 'fleur'😂😂😂
I've heard caijin accents more difficult to underatand does anyone remember the charscter on Saturday Night Live talkung in such a way you can not get any words he is saying and of course one guy in Dick Tracy named Mumbles we found out he actually could make sense that was the only person who did not get killed later on another funny moment was Steve Martin doing his conedy perfirmace in his own way and poking fun of the french accent adding to this late great George Carlin that did a little bit of the same by poking fun of the human language things we say but not examining words in diffsrent ways I often wonder who invented words in our hiatoey where did they originate from and develop later on  ?
I like you jacksepticeye and paddy 🍀💚🇮🇪😁🤩⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
Oil beef hooked
Duh; “JackSexyEyes!!!” Dang!!!🍀☘️😺😼🗺️🏞️🛤️
Loved going around and in Ireland areas with my mom for my 35th birthday which I thank her tremendously for doing the trip. Soooooo many red-heads and in my element I felt like I was normal but, it was hard to understand language (and/or said/written).
Happy St. Paddy’s Day; March 2025🗺️🏞️🌄😺😼🍀☘️🍺🍾☕️🫖🍽️
Now in 2025 Jack should react and try to understand Gerald from Clarkson's Farm.
Snatch is my favorite movie, Brad Pitt did play a pikey i don't know if that makes a difference or not.
Okay, I know this was a while ago but maybe he can do a part 2 and include David Boreanaz’s accent in Buffy. It was awful!
Irish man: hshhmeenisheen  English man: excuse me bruv could you say that again please?
Hearing English in Irish accent is almost like hearing Icelandic in Faroese accent, it's very unique and I like it
Jacksepticeye is flexing his Irish card 🇮🇪🇮🇪🇮🇪🇮🇪🇮🇪🇮🇪🇮🇪🇮🇪
I need jack to react to those videos that have the Irish getting drunk haha he would love it
2025? 😂
ah sure now your one on RTE there was just an old man, probably a granda by the sounds of things
My dads grand parents were from Ireland and he couldn’t understand what the hell that farmer was saying.
If I was listening to the Sheep Farmer, I would just think he was speaking straight Irish.
I laughed way too hard at this video. Jesus jack you're hilarious! Sad I missed this gem 4 years ago, glad I found it now thanks for the laugh! Really needed it
Brad pot was playing a traveller/gypsy it’s not English it’s not Irish it’s just well Pikey
You need to look at Devil's Own. Brad Pitt and Harrison Ford. Paul Ronan was Brad Pitt's friend. One of my cousins, who is from Cork, just destroyed him and said he wasn't Irish. True, he wasn't born in Ireland, but he was born to Irish parents and raised in Ireland. He's fluent in Irish. The Irish criticize the Irish for being fake or real.
I was at a screenwriting residency in Hollywood in 1989.  There was a man from Cork there. I was the only person who could understand him. I was translating English to English. Ironically, one of the speakers was Maureen O'Hara's brother, Charles Fitzsimmons. The three of us got on well together. After a while, no one but the three of us could understand the three of us.
As someone with celtic ascent I can confirm irish people jump up and down in a pub playing flute while chugging tons of guinness.
Because Brad Pitt is speaking Irish.  Jason Statham explains all of that before Brad says a word  Its Not Irish Its Not English its well its Pikey.
Pleaseee i wanna hear you do your best northern accent hahaha i love hearing people trying to do Derry accents 😢😅
You need to do a tutorial on how to do your specific Irish accent
that guy at 6:00 is like the boomhauer of irishmen
Worst fake Accent  2:32
Brad Pitt actually nailed it imo.
Rowers aren't that hard to understand
Being from the east coast of Canada, it wasn't hard to understand any of them.
Sometimes I can’t even hear the accent at least on Sean.
I could understand the irish athletes
English need to be translate to english??💀
5:05 My man be speaking in Wingdings, fam
12:16 Me during the Irish Aural exam for my leaving cert and I start hearing a new dialect I've never heard smh. _(Nobody wrote down the same answers, we were cooked...)_
Yaaay! Skibbereen represent!!! That was the accent I could understand no problem, the others were hit and miss ngl
5:49 - i'm convinced it's always "in the south" of every country where you find the thickest accents. 😂👍
For the sheep farmer I heard something about 45 sheep😂
I love being able to understand dialects and accents
The spar bag on the head for Limerick was such an obvious reference to the Rubber Bandits now, c'mon!
omg I visited Dublin and had zero trouble understanding anyone but if I end up in some rural part of Kerry I'm going to struggle a lot if that's what a lot of farmer types sound like. But mind you I'm in the South of England (almost South-West) and some of the farmers round here can be pretty hard to understand.
🤍🖤❤️‍🩹☘️🇮🇪👑🐐
"I want to watch it, tho", the way it sounds in comparison with afro American is different. Had someone told me to stop using 'ain't ', ain't it's a word , he was from somewhere from UK or probably Ireland, dunno...dunno...
Honesty, all accents can be confusing depending on where in that country you're from, to be honest.
I am half Irish half Scottish and my accent reflects that and from my experience with people is one of three they love they don’t care or on the odd occasion I am either corrected on pronunciation or they scream speak English
I'm from Poland. I live in West Cork for almost 20 years. I still can't understand people from Portlaoise 😂
"bad"?
I understood em all, except the sheep guy at the beginning, I could figure out context for the rest, while Mr. Sheep was just a lot of words. Local figures of speech I guess, it’s kinda like folks from Newfoundland, I hear the words, I just don’t know what they’re saying 😅
Hubby and I went to stay with an Irish friend of his, when I met the friend I asked my husband privately if his friend was speaking English as I couldn't understand a word! It took about three days before I came to understand what he was saying. Kind of embarrassing to look back on.
9:24 As an American with a Jamaican background, I'm tripping that I can actually understand what these athletes are saying.   But then again, there are rumors of Irish ancestry in the Caribbean.  So maybe it's hidden in the language.
Brad Pitt's accent wasn't a pure Irish accent. It was Pikey. They even tell you about it in the movie a bit. And from what I've heard. Its pretty much spot on.
why does the frostbit kid look like a teen version of gman from half life
Im an Irish woman with an extremely flat Dublin accent and until recently I've never heard a non Irish actor do our accent justice. I recently started watching 1923 the series and I have to give Helen Miren her flowers. Her Irish accent is AMAZING. Best and most convincing from a non Irish actress. Also as a Dub I can't understand a strong kerry/Cork accent so I don't expect people from other lands to understand. Ppl from kerry sing their sentences. It's funny. If your driving in those counties and your looking for directions and a local tells you keep going straight up It's only up the road. Just no your going to be driving for at least an hour maybe two. Up the road has a different meaning to them. If you don't know you would think they have sent you in the wrong direction 😂 💚🇨🇮🇨🇮🇨🇮🇨🇮🇨🇮🇨🇮🇨🇮🇨🇮🇨🇮🇨🇮🇨🇮🇨🇮🇨🇮
You sound like a Pikey from the movie Snatch.
Can you give up? thank you.
Chris Walken stars in a movie set in Dublinhattan
How are Irish accents good. English is def better
Meanwhile us Irish Americans are wishing we had command of mother tongue enough to travel the Gaeltacht with no trouble
It's so interesting how certain Irish accents sound like certain Caribbean ones
I'm Irish and I'm even having trouble understanding the sheep farmer
4:55 I've listened to this guy several times and all I get is the word "sheep".
6:13 the problem with this Kerry accent is is the the structure intonation (Lilt) and pacing are from another language Gaeilge. I’m guessing Irish is his first language. After you account for that, it’s as clear as cristal.
Ngl I’m Irish myself and I can’t even notice my own accent, it doesn’t sound very Irish lol (I don’t have an accent)
Did the rower at Rio say he peed in a cup?
I live in Ireland so I understand some things that they say😂
I'm from the Netherlands trying to understand Irish accents. Hahah, great video. 😂. We also have  accents/dialects that foreign people don't get. It goes from town to town. You can only know if you're a local. Ha, biggest mistake I made when I met an Irishman in Dublin and we were going for a coffee. So I asked, what's the best place to go to because you're a local. Oooooooh how offended he was. He said no I'm from Waterford. Then walked me around in Dublin to teach me some history and yes, we finally got a coffee. Wich I paid for hahaha. Fair enough,i insulted him. Love it. Sometimes it's hard to make fun or jokes when it's not in your native language/dialect.
Someone once told that accent coach lady that her Irish accent was good and she ran with it
my dad never liked jack but i knew that his favorite movies were snatch and hot fuzz and when i showed him this video he started watching jack with me
Brad Pitt was doing a traveller accent and I've met many of them fellas that sound exactly like that
I understood everything the Kerry farmer said. Not sure what that says about me. I'm Irish, but not from Kerry
I was so shocked when jack could translate what the farmer was saying!! it doesn't even sound like english
19:49 You didn't recognize a Rubberbandits reference? And you call yourself Irish?
Richie Griffin talks quite scandinavian.
ive watched this so many times and, being from louth, ive to say that theres NOT a louth accent😭
I didn't know the Irish were chill like that
0:41 EXACTLY! LIVING IN THE MIDLANDS IS    P    E    A    K    LIVING
The issue is, is that there is 16 different accents accross ireland, including from the actual Irish langauge (Gaeilge), and Irish-English. So which do you pick?
5:25 nooo not the 🏳️‍⚧️ sheep 🥺
5:33 I put the subtitles on all it picked up was sheep brione
I’m loving  that but I understand them all having lived in Ireland. Jack here hasn’t got a strong accent though - I hope they never change! This modern world is trying to iron us all out to be the same and it’s just great that Ireland retains its individuality
Want a REALLY bad Irish accent? Richard Gere playing Declan Mulqueen in The Jackal (1997)
I heard the farmer through my speakers and now I summoned a demon
So I tried to understand what the student said here 8:08 and I think he said something like "Well my mother says I have to go and I hadn't much a choice in the matter."
You didn’t do Gerald from Clarksons Farm
WTF Jeff 😂
Years later rewatching…. Still a great content.
Funnily I read a thing that said the Glaswegian accent was the most annoying and he’s saying it’s the sexiest
8:52 they sound exactly like CallMeKevin
Reacting to Newfie dialect would blow Jack’s mind 🤯
Have you guys checked out Cillian Murphy's accent  in Disco Pigs yet? I had to rewind several times. Irish people in the reviews were even having trouble understanding him. Someone said his accent sounded Jamaican. LOL
I'm from the southwestern united states. Sounds  like ya want to steal me lucky charms. Lucky charms is a cerial. Their spokesman is a leprechaun.
I'm convinced the farmer was speaking Irish and not English with an Irish accent.
I understand all of them which is odd cuz I am Irish but not a whole bunch of
omg i would have thought Wild Mountain Thyme was from 1991. 2020? Is it satire?
There’s no way this is still considered English 😂😂😂
Poor Kerrywoman. Anglo-Irish people exist! I grew up with that sort of accent in the Maynooth/Celbridge/Straffan area. I absolutely believe she could be from Kerry, which would make it the accent of at least one Kerrywoman. But in any county the Anglo-Irish are a tiny minority and our accent doesn't really represent any part of Ireland. She sounds like she could be a member of my family. I know people from almost every county with that accent.  I grant you using a tiny minority accent isn't a great way to represent a whole county. But then again the Louth man doesn't have a typical Louth accent either, and the Northsider doesn't exactly sound like a Moore Street vendor or a Colm Meaney or any of the archetypical Northsiders I know. I think they just got a bunch of Irish people and listed their counties, without really asking if their accent is representative of that county.
Best quote I ever heard from an Irish friend- "I like me' women, like I like me' coffee. Hot, sweet and all down me' front." 😛 I nearly choked on my tongue.
farty-five sheep😂😂😂😂😂😂
It’s 4 in the morning and Farty five has me in tears
The accent is i think is the most interesting was yours sorry evybudy else
If you girl came up to me and start speaking me like this, I’d be thinking things
Guy In my school speaks straight Irish farmer
I’ll take a thanks to Scotland I won’t complain that we’re third 😂
Goddamn, I usually have a bit of a knack for language and accents, and it took me 5 listens to pick out 5 different words from that Farmer. I'm glad Jack could hear it because I'd have probably had an Aneurysm by now.
Have ya tried watching a bit of Father Ted? Even just a bit of Foil Arms & Hog? Getting access to actual Irish dialog ain't that hard...
I can understand every single one of them even though English isn’t my first language
"the t is an sh sound" at 14:00 english: shit irish: shish
Its not 45 it’s fartty foive
Sheep guy sounds like he is talking swedish XD
In Snatch Turkish says it’s not English it’s not Irish it’s just pikey. It’s a mix of the two languages
The idea that Sean was kicked out of Ireland for spreading misinformation about Irish people saying "top 'o the mornin" to Americans is hilarious to me.
6:54
Listen to danny and micheal healyraes accent it's so strong lol
It's mad every county has there own accent and every county has at least 3 different accent you can live in a town go 5 miles out to the country side and its different
my friend is a traveler and he thinks brad pit did a fantastic job.
I voted it as MY most sexy accent when I was very young!!  I DREAM of being with an Irish man!!
Christopher Walken is so awesome, he can do whatever the hell he wants and he's earned it. Erm, great video too!
So sad..the Anglo colonised mind of this lad uses the word "bad" to describe Irish accents....good little gombeen
00:20 not yours pal
Emily Blunt is one of your favorite actresses??? In what?
There was a radio announcer on my local classical music station with an Irish accent. It was the most beautiful accent I’ve ever heard, I could listen to her all day.
As a Brit, that Kerry girl was defo one of ours
I loooove Irish  accent. 🥰
iv never had a problem understanding irish as a Scotsmen its properly the closest to us but some of the gypsy Irish can be a bit harder to follow but I think that's the point .. I think the Irish accent influenced the American accent
I'm Irish, and i understand a bit of what the farmers were saying
As someone who is Half-Irish, I don't understand these accents either.
Enlish: Bloody Irish: Bleedin America: FUCKIN
In the sheep one I only caught every like, third word. I think.
Sean: "Instead or 'your woman' we always say 'yer bhean', idk why"  A mystery indeed 😂
I'm an American, and I frankly rely HEAVILY on Sean's accent to help me nail the Irish accent 😂
Hay jack don't disrespect the scotts
Reminds me of how surprised people get when I tell them the reason Appalachian English doesn't sound like English is because it's NOT English. It's not not English as well. It's ~technically~ a dialect of Scots-English :)  Also most of my grandmother's family is originally from county Kerry, is this farmer how they fucking sounded!??!?
WTF😂
Is what’s cool is the more you listen the clearer it gets it’s strange lmfao
So, you guys can actually understand what he's saying?
To be fair Pitt was a pikey in the movie, their accent at least to me has always been rather gibberish. But that's coming from a Swede so what the hell do i know 😂
bhuel tá na hÉireannaigh ar na cinn is rathúla ó thaobh an chaint de in 2020
Mirror in my american accent is even worse than Jack's: "Meer" you only understand it via context.
I understood the rowers and the frostbit guy, but the shepherd may as well have been a different language lmao.
North Dublin and Cork do not sound like the accents from there. College accents. Kerry was probably born there and grew up in the England.
Diafuckingbolical. I've heard lots of Irish had watching parties for Wild Mountain Thyme to slag it.  I couldn't've have watched even for the craic. I assume it was hugely successful in America. And what era was it set in? Her wearing a shawl and then you realise it's supposed to be present day? Amazing she wasn't in her bare feet.
You know you’re fucked when you can’t even understand jacksepticeye’s translation 😭
my auditory processing issues are having a field day, i already have to ask people with a slightly stronger version of my own accent (southern US) to repeat themselves 3 times :')
Any time I attempt a Jamaican accent making fun of the old "Call me for your free reading" it ends up Irish. Don't even know how that works. They are close?? Bua ha ha!
Ireland4life 🇮🇪 ❤
The Sheep farmer sounds like he's speaking Welsh
That's the west alright
she is teaching a Monahan accent
Brad Pitt is doing an Irish traveller accent who are usually born in England, not a typical Irish one. They actually talk like that too he nails it
Fleare 😂
It's funny how natives can hear the differences in their accents, and non-natives can hear the similarities.
Which county is Jack from?
You absolutely do get that squeaky bit in your voice when you introduce yourself to the internet.
The Sheep hearder guy's accent is the most interesting one.
I think a lot of the accents that are often thought of as sexy are the ones typically from the major cities. So like the most appealing Irish accents to me were the Northside Dublin and Cork accents.
I’d like to preface this with I’m Australian lol. I could understand most of those accents, except ol’ mate with the sheep. So I thought, how many people can understand the Aussie accent. And I was shocked to find people struggle with the accents from people that live up ship creek lmao. Probably cause they talk a million miles an hour
Im from offaly😊
i love cork but omg everyone has so many diffrent accsents like i live near town but the north side is way diffrent from the west. the amount of times ive been told im talking to fast is so funny. i have autism so i developed this like autism accsent so i sound very american but i somtimes say random thinfs that just sound so irish its srange
Irish, Scottish and New Zealand accents are the most difficult accents to master 😂😂
I can understand Island Patwa, British and Australian accents. BUT GODDAMN THAT FARMER IS ON ANOTHER LEVEL!
I thought he said have a good jog😅
Listening exams be like 😂
5:37 even the dog is confused
Lad, I'm Irish, these "Irish accents" in movies are the most horrible thing I've ever seen😂😅
Do you live in Ireland?
Bros accent is heavier than casohs
I can’t tell when watching these videos if this guys name is Jack or Sean… that’s what I’m held up on… haha.  Also, I LOVE all the Irish accents. My family is originally from Ireland (on my Dads side)  There is a town there that is my real last name… been wondering if waaayyy down the line, my ancestors founded it.
Irish people here
So want the Bob Marley movie
honestly her american accent even sounds fake like she’s working wayyyy too hard to overpronounce every sound
YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO IM IRISH WWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
hello fellow Irish
Adult tdm
Although the accents are completely different, I love that both Aussies and the Irish hardly seem to move their mouths when their talking. 😂 Love the video and hello from Down Under.
I’m Irish and it’s scary that in can understand what he’s saying
Fair enough, because I live in the state of Indiana, U.S.A. Our state has different accents and there are 49 other states! There is a general American Accent, and there are large regional accents that cover many states, and more specific accents depending on what part of a particular state you’re in! Confused yet, because I am.
I met a girl from Ireland, I thought she said Arland TX. To be fair she was wearing boots
I reference the sheep guy in this video so much.
love an irish accent i always get called irish cus i’m ginger and people think most irish ppl r ginger and leprechauns and i’m like i’m not even irish but love u sean my brother got me watching u when i was younger!
It's all fun and games until you mention the cyounty cyavan accent
I’m IRISH!❤❤❤❤
Listening to the thick irish accent reminds me of listening to Friesen country folk
Sorry Sean, but my first thought was your own... sorry lad
As an American. Hearing all of these. Sean sounds the exact same....
Proud I can actually understand the kerry accent 😭
rewatching this ages later because youtube decided to shove this onto my homepage again, and it killed me how instantly wrong but also not wrong the 'how to do an irish accent lady' was. like the general idea she had was correct when pronouncing I/ireland, but she kept closing the first vowel of the diphthong too much. it's far closer to the korean vowel eo than the closed lip oo sound she was making. once we got to 'flower' it fell apart completely LOL. she even contradicts herself immediately after the i/ireland diphthong mistake by doing that closed vowel at the start of the diphthong, but then correctly saying immediately after that vowels in irish english move from the back of the mouth to the front in a fluid motion, which means a dipthong isn't going to start with a closed vowel and then open. it will either start with an open vowel and close, or use exclusively closed or exclusively open vowels. this is a concept that carried over to the irish english dialect from the irish language.
The sexiest?! I enjoy it but the sexiest? How many people were polled and who took part?
I just looked up the movie Wild Mountain Thyme on IMDB, and one of its trivia was "The Irish press expressed shock and disappointment in the horrible Irish accents in this film prior to its release."😂
“Why is the Kerry person English?!?! 😂 “ then you pause the video thank God. I’m from Ireland (more importantly from Cork!) and also love how diverse our accents are 😂 I’ve lived in Dublin the last 5 years and LOVE going back to cork coz I can fully appreciate how lilting and MELODIC our accents are 😍😍 sick of f£&ckin Dubs!
"FARTY FOIV SHEEP"
Brad Pitts accent was actually pretty spot on for an Irish TRAVELLER, if you compared it to a normal Irish accent then it's dog shite but that's not what he's doing
the accent people think of, which irish accent is that, because thats the accent i got from my great grandad but im from California so the two accents dont mix well
Repeat after me: Whale Oil Beef Hooked 😉.
I understand the sheep farmer. North east Scotland. Doric speaker.
You're not hard to understand Jack and the only thing I got out of that shepherd was that 45 sheep were lost but with that accent it's like Swedish to me but there are some words I can catch in them
Jack:  MiRR   xD  what a natural
Brad pitts accent was an irish travellers which is different and he did a pretty good job
I have lived in cork my whole life but my parents aren't Irish so I'm not very exposed to the accent... The only heavy Irish accent I understand is the cork accent
The accents in the EVENFLOW youtube channel are my benchmark for Irish accents 😂
the farmer was really funny for me, because when I went to Ireland, I was on one of the smaller islands off the west coast (can't remember the name, but it was near the Cliffs of Mohr) but I was at a B&B and there was this really nice old guy and he was trying to talk to me, and he sounded kinda like that, and the whole time, a couple of people were standing just out at the edge of where we were talking just keeled over laughing because they knew I had no clue what he was saying.
Pitt sounded more like a Newfoundlander
The guy narrating the farmers accent sounds the salesman for the Irish prep bowl
You sound like young Jordan Peterson lol
The sheep farmer actually has a very norwegian cadence when he speaks, which I find interesting.
Also would I understand the guy with the sheep if I spoke Irish. I’m from Kilkenny and dyslexic so never learned Irish. I love the Irish language. But I’m to dumb to know it
Okay, this is three years old. So my opinion means nothing. And I’m not a traveller, so I can’t speak to is it a good travellers accent. But it’s pretty cool that Brad Pitt played an Irish traveller. And Irish traveller is definitely different than most other Irish accents (. As one beautiful man told me there’s a whole language that you don’t understand.<3
I’ve got a little crush type thing on my teacher who Irish and I love it 😍
County "Kirk"
Where is your scream?
The accent is from the original Irish language
I'm Irish
2:12 one of the EASIEST things to do to sound Irish is pronounce the letter R, hard, when it’s in a word, and DO NOT add an R where there isn’t one like they do in England and Australia
I had no idea what there were saying
the shepherd sounds like english from the 1100s
in 2019 it was the Kiwi accent.
It's hilarious that the YT subtitle somewhat understood the heavy accented Kerry sheep farm bois 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Sout Wesht Oirland :)
Frostbet in Irish 😂😂😂😂 now that is super Irish!!
That Christopher walken impression killed me
Ireland is like my second home, and I think thats one of the reasons I love watching Sean's videos so much. It allows me a bit of Ireland when I cant be there.
12:17 I’m from Glasgow and it’s the same over here, there is no one Scottish or Irish or Welsh accent, someone from Aberdeen sounds completely different to me. Its especially annoying because generally “accent coaches” teach people how to do Birmingham and Liverpool and London and RP but they only teach one accent for Scotland, Ireland and Wales
Been watchin a lot of jack over the years and you can hear his accent steadily get lesser and lesser as the years go by :D
This is very similar to trying to understand some yorkshire farmers from around where I live
The reason that people's impressions of you dont sound right is because theyre being filtered through a cereal mascot.
You should try to learn the “Fredrikstad” dialect.
The best accent is Connacht
8:08 that "kid" sounds about 45 wtf.
I'm irish and I can't understand some accents in Co.kerry and Co.Cork.And the Northern Irish accent is also hard to understand too.
Jack would love to hear the Newfie accent.
sorry if kind of ignorant but... this means that not all irish people understand english??? or they do
Does anyone else think his accent got thicker throughout the video subconsciously
Sheep is west cork anyway
After the farmers, I felt very accomplished that I understood the rowers
Ah sure were just having the craic
Even after the translation, I'm still not totally convinced the first sheep guy from Kerry isn't speaking at least a little Gaelic. School was taught in Gaelic in at least some parts of Co. Kerry back when this guy looks like he might have been in school, so tbh it feels possible!
are u still in the uk then
irish accents are my favorite
Im veery proud of that louth accent  fun fact ive metthose rowers
I recently found a Harry Potter fanfic where quite a few characters, Harry included, speak with I believe it’s called a Belfast accent, since that’s where the first setting was relocated.  I thought it was very good, even though it got abandoned a few years ago. :(
Did I miss something about moonshine
How does brad wind up in the weirdest places
I'm Christopher WALKIN trying to be IRISH
The Sheep guy reminds me of this one video of a Norwegian guy being interviewed about a boat fire or something and his dialect is SO THICK that barely anyone can understand it
Jack is the only Irish guy I understand, Achievement accomplished
this was one of the funniest videos ever and so much love :D
FROSTBUTT?? LMAOOO
Brad Pitt isn't supposed to sound Irish, he's sounding like an Irish traveller living in England. Even to my ear travellers don't sound Irish in the same way as Irish people do
I was hoping you would examine a real accent that is absolutely unintelligible. Better than I could’ve imagined 😂
I understood everything that was being said and I have flat accent
Those rowers were hilarious.
Ah yes, I often look at myself in the mrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr.
that irish boy taliing frost=bit  sound scottish doric to me
"farty five"
That’s crazy.. he predicted the french shitting. 😭
Brad Pitt doesn’t play an Irishman. He plays a traveller. The Cork guys are perfectly understandable. I can’t hear the difference between the Dubliners and Cork.
I find nothing sexy about the Irish accent as an American. Maybe because I was screamed at  with the accent as a child! 😅
Telling the difference between Irish and Scottish accents is a bit tricky, at least to my American ears. I've noticed the Irish have trouble with the th sound and Scotts don't. I've never an Irishman say wee referring to small things.
I have to say Brad Pitt did a great job honestly! I'm from Dublin but right at the edge of the county. Had a lot of 'travelers' come through and stay in the town and Brads accent is spot on!
The UFO of accents is Bangor Maine.  Wild as hell.
I used to work with an Irish lass, she had been watching the netflix series "Power" and in the staff room she asked about 8 of us "zeniwun seen Parr?" She had to slow down and repeat 3 times before anyone understood what she was saying and people find our accent hard to understand (Geordie) 😂
That farmer.. can't believe I understood half of it, feeling fucking proud
Every time I hear this guy's name I immediately think of Pink Eye. Someone must have farted in his face.
The frost bit one is just how I hear people speak up in louchmacrory 😂
I have learned about moon shine night now.
I'm from cork but I was in kerry earlier today and there was this man that my Grandad was talking to and he had the strongest accent I've ever heard
this video has a higher view count than the population of Ireland
5:25 I exclaimed, "Forty-five?!" at the exact same time.
As a north east australian... you sound scottish but without the "im being oppressed by England" accent
I like daggs
he thought south side dublin was strong
to be fair, Brad Pitt is also doing a very particular pikey accent, which is even weirder than regular Irish
I’ve never met anyone else that knows about snatch! Great movie 😮
I missed the Mayo accent!!
Wild Mountain Thyme is shot where I live and the film is the number one most cringiest thing I've ever watched in me whole feckin life!! Absolutely horrendous 😂
I wonder what county Sean is from
The dark haired Olymic winner showed about as much dead face as the Scottish Tennis winner Andy Murry lol
northside dublin kinda scared me (Live near the airport)
true even me as I'm Irish as well .  but i do think that some of it was good as an Irish accent .
I don't know what it is.. But I kinda feel like thick Irish accent sounds like what English used to sound like to me when I was little (as someone who's native language isn't English)
u mumble less Sean.. lol
Not really oirland but more like aireland so she got that a little wrong imo but idk maybe that's a different accent than me what I'm used to
The Ulster accent in the 2nd vid from the reporter
I wonder of there are any american accents non americans can’t understand.
Needa find me an Irish man
I can understand it because I’m a newfy
The irish farmer is a pure example of braking all the rules of accents and just straight up making your own language 🤣
Cork energy! WOOOO!
I am from Northern Ireland
Farty Five sheep
Any chance of a tommy tiernan reaction jack?
"I can't speak Gaelic so I'm just going to be really hard to understand!"
I can understand the sheep farmer's accent. I thought it was only Americans who found it hard to understand English with an accent. The farmer is just saying that anyone can  come up the mountain and steal sheep.
I like warxhing irish people criticize irish accents. Every time Im just like, thats exactly what you sound like. . .
When Jack was making  fun of Wild mountain thyme and he said “he had a ROCK tied to his Nyeck” it legit sounded like Gru 😭😂
Mate I’m Australian 🇦🇺
Glaswegian accent is the best
to be fair (to be faaaaaiiir) to Brad Pitt, his accent was described as "Pikey. It's not English, it's not Irish, it's just... pikey"
Nadine from Girls Aloud actually says "flour" like that, there is a video
I keep confusing the Irish accent with the Scottish accent, so I found this video to remind me of what it sounds like.
No you do not sound like that at all.
Why don't they have people who actually have a real accent, or at least coach them.
U speak clear. Irish are my favorite people but i can barley understand a word. I understand everything u say. I think its a cadence thats different. That messes me up .
I'm over here in America, I can easily understand all of the clips he's played so far but the shepherds were hard. I think that's normal, though, try understanding an old logger out here in northern Maine, it's about the same.
Sean kinda sounds like cartwright
He does for this one!
I’ll always remember going up to the north to the dentist and my mother got lost and a farmer gave us directions and none of us understood him 🤣🤣 I do love poking fun at my friend from Monaghan though… TURRRRRSDAY 🤣🤣 I’m in Sligo and either the accent is pretty or I’m just used to it 🤣 my bfs friend moved up to Dublin as a teen and he has a full dub accent these days 😂I honestly DIED at the last video 🤣🤣🤣
fun fact I learned from an Irish friend was thet the Irish actually have a language but aparantly thier main language is english now cuz well England but the language is still taught in schools I had asked him cuz i have Irish Heritige and wanted to learn more about Ireland cuz i wanted to visit there some day :3 (please tell me if i'm wrong)  5:57 also i understsnd some of ehat hes saying but you have to pay close attention and listen
Moving to Dublin. Learning Irish. All the various agreements seem a bit banjaxed as of yet.
If heavy European accents get harder to understand, do heavy American accents get easier to understand?😄
Pitts accent is pikey
I have a scottish accent and my friend keeps trying to do one to and it sounds AWFUL
The best Irish accent by an American was Jon Voight in The General and worst Irish accent is a split decision between Kevin Spacey in Ordinary Decent Criminal and Tommy Lee Jones in Blown Away
I have to admit my Siri is set to Irish man. 😂
6:43 I don't care how irish you are Sean, you canNOT convince me that this giy didn't just say "All you need is to have a good jog and you'll be fine"
I laughed
I’m Irish as well ☘️
12:31 honestly i always think of that when i see people trying to give accent tutorials. Like I'd love for anyone trying to do an "american" accent to meet my Brooklyn accented family at the same time as like, a midwestern, or southerner.
Some people related to me at some point were from Ireland so I'm completely not qualified to say that I think that Brad's performance works in my opinion because he's playing a sort of trailer gypsy guy who no one understands. I think as long as it sounds vaguely Irish it's not distracting for that reason.
Wait how did these Olympic rowers not even move their lips while speaking 😮
To be fair, when I was younger I loved Finian's Rainbow purely because Fred Astaire 's and Tommy Steele's Irish accents in it. 😂 The singing and dancing may have had something to do with it though.
BTW Brad Pits accent was supposed to be basically  inaudible.
Am I the only one who wants to see him try to do other accents??
That strong accent with the sheep farmer almost reminds me of welsh in a weird way
The cork accent sounds Jamaican I can understand it very well
I thought Brad Pitt's character was more of a 'traveler' than an Irish person from Ireland?
Every and any movie should have rill ack sent
Mikey has to be half drunk. My family sounds like the sheep farmer when they come to America and we're hanging about after a few beers. I literally just stare at them nodding my head. Either that or he speaks fluent Irish and English is his second language. Side note, my cousins brought their friend with them and he was even worse than the sheep farmer. Our only common language was making out all night.
This is the origin for American Southern accent melded with Cockney.
Hi, new sub. I just came across this channel and I think your great. I love the Irish accent, my maternal grandfather and his family came from somewhere around Dubland.     I've heard a pretty HARD Scottish accent and, I have been kind of good at trying to slow my hearing down to catch words being said in other accents, but some of the Scottish accents, forget it, I got a little guy in my head with a badge trying to right a speeding ticket on their mouth. Lol. Thanks. I'll be back 😎
Somehow because i’m Irish, I understood all the heavy accents.
I've never heard any irish person say oil-land if you want to pronounce it right its I-aer-land or ei-yer-land or Rrr-land. I think most americans mispronounce it by over emphasizing the the Ire part but its almost like a single syllable.
we say merrrrr it duh midwest
Absolutely hilarious.
The Limerick animation was a reference to Blindboy boatclub from the rubber bandits
now THIS is why i subscribed to the internet irishman
Ahh bless the lad, I would haveof cursed out lil Tristmigustus for that!! Protectors of thrives and travellers...So he protect Irish travellers then. Very well then say no more about it.
I used to work for an Irishman and when he would go visit and come back, I wouldn’t be able to understand a damn thing he said.
Italian is better and i say that as an italian
As a Kerry man, I see nothing wrong with Mikey Joe's accent
Could you LOVE the southwest of Ireland anymore!!!?? How did they not do " C'meretamee"?
Did anybody elses mind go to a bad place when he said he "went down an Irish accent hole"?
I know the Irish don’t think so but you do sound very musical.
From Appalachia USA.  Even this accent varies from northern to southern Appalachia.  Most of us say it as apple latch ya in stead of app a lay she a.  Some common phrases. Squeet-let’s go eat. Shes ore the holler-she is over in the hollow or she lives across the hollow. Down yonder ways- go down the road for a while. Back of beyond- lots of miles away, probably another state or the other end of the state.
5:27 i love the trans flag on the sheep ik it wasnt intentional but very cute
Sean is the reason the irish accent is the most sexiest in the world
Christopher Walken speaks with a Christopher Walken accent.  No one else sounds like him.
What i love about our isle is that the thicker the accent the less their lips move 😂😂
As a French person, I ate some shit.
It sounds more like german than english
I’m half Irish and I trying to learn the accent since I didn’t have one, and this people suck at the accent real hard tbh
Ireland is just a greener verison of the UK
That olympian sounded Jamaican
I got a jack Daniel’s add for this video YouTube knows what they’re doing
I find his accent, insufferable, very much like Saoirse bleedin Ronan, ahhhhhh!!!!!
Brad Pitt plays an Irish traveller in Snatch, not an Irish person. Theres a big difference between being an irish traveller and being Irish. The majority of Irish travellers in England/Scotland /Wales have never been to anywhere in Ireland let alone been born there. They speak with the accents they have because they dont really associate outside of their own families and community, and just pick up that accent from birth, so they tend to have an "irish" accent that you probably couldn't place it in actual Ireland/Northern Ireland. I come from irish grandparents on my dads side but my soeaking voice is 100% local to the town i live in in England. I have a friend though, who was born in England, but is from a traveller family, and he has a mainly irish sounding accent, and although he has visited Ireland once or twice in his life, his most recent family that came from ireland before him is a grandparent on one side, and 2 great grandparents on the other side. But everyone in his home life speaks pretty much the same as he does. They arent putting a fake irish accent on, its just their natural speaking accent.  And in regards to Snatch, to be honest although he might not sound irish, Brad Pitt sounds a hell of a lot like the irish travellers do. also, regarding my mate has the traveller accent at home, but then has a generic vaguely local English accent for when he's outside of his home life. He's multilingual and multiaccented. And hes also doing what a lot of the travelling community have started doing, whch they never used to, and putting down roots, buying a house and settling down locally here. So maybe traveller isn't the right word for him now.
I could watch this all day. I luv the Irish accent.
I’m Irish on my mom’s side
As an Iriish man it's not the accent it's talking about nothing for hours on end and having great craic.  When you get get your better half asks "what did you talk about". Nothing.  I'm glad I'm an Irishman
But...what happened to your eye?
but that was gypsy they have there own way of speaking
Irish is the best! It is lilting and singsong, absolutely beautiful.
I was active duty on a Nato base. There was a bar there and the English, Scottish, Welsh, and Irish were there. In the beginning I couldn't understand anyone. Then it was like that scene from the 13th warrior. Once I had enough booze suddenly I could understand everyone. Not only that I could hear the differences in accents. I could understand the accents here, but yeah it runs off into gibberish.
This guy's Christopher Walken is on point lol
I'm fucking proud of myself that's my English learning skills got so far that I can understand a few Irish words
FLIR ? Forward Looking Infra-Red ?
Ur english is very clear!
Today I found out I’m from north of Dublin bc I live in the middle of Dublin but my accent I say dat dere and does
SNATCH is still today one of my top favorite movies of all time.
I love the Northern Irish accent
As an ignorant American, I can understand you well. With the Irish farmers, I was lost along with the sheep.
At 1:47 i thought I saw an O'driscoll because he was wearing a cowboy outfit with a green vest
Is the limerick character blindboy 😂😂😂
I feel like Ireland is southern part of America. You have the southern accent but then you go further south and it gets heavier and thicker like the farmer. i.e. Louisiana. Same for Scotland but they're in the Appalachian mountains and everyone has alcohol and moonshine so now you really don't understand a word, you just know everyone is having fun.
These are good, but nothing beats Jeremy Clarkson on his farm with Kaleb screaming at him for being dumb 😂
5:24 farty-five sheep is actually a buttload of sheep...
Here im from cork and were no that loud
Her name was Kerry 😂🤣
First time seeing that farmer first time when I moved here couldn't get a word in now I can but I'm also originally from Somerset where Hot Fuzz was made and that farmer I could understand fine
"yer gwan" man Jamaican REALLY does come from Irish! I honestly thought it was a f*cking joke at first ngl cause they couldn't be more f*cking different culturally 😂
the Irish accent is basically just pronouncing every vowel as e and you can't fight me about it
there's NO F*CKING WAY that farmer is speaking English
seriously WHY TF NOT JUST CAST IRISH ACTORS???? like there's literally never been more and more famous acclaimed talented and popular wtf???? it's like the Irish year 😭😭😭😭😭
Too much foul language
When they said irish accents are sexy they meant northern obviously 😂😂😂
I think in scribbles now
Looks like it's important to stress that this is AN Irish accent---not THE Irish accent. :) Man, I want to go to Ireland so bad. I don't care if I can't understand 90% of what anybody says; I want to go to Ireland.
Jacksepticeye's impression of Christopher walken Doing an impression of an Irishman Sounds like the terminator 2:15.
The wan from Kerry is probably close to west cork cos there was a load of English hippies made a community out there and now west cork heads sound English but were born in Ireland
Jack knows Brad was a traveler, so super specific accent. Just down the road they'd burn a caravan to the ground if someone passed away in it.   In the west and especially on the islands, its a whole new accent. Loved my time on Inis Meáin. Quiet but with a gorgeous pint at the end of the day.
How the hell he translated that man with the sheep 😮😭
Your Walken accent is better than his Irish accent but don't make it a bragging point.
2024 and just got this goldie :) Loved it!
I've literally never heard an irish accent and thought to myself....now thats sexy 😅😅😅
5:52 Oh God he reminds me of this guy from Kentucky they call him the Turtle Man.   He had a show on Animal Planet, Call of the Wildman.
0:40 I scream laughed, its 1:30AM.. lol
Jamaica 🇯🇲 accent is also similar to Irish accent 😂😂
The Brad Pitt accent was great
I am a foreign person living in Ireland for about 24 years I understand that Cork farmers very well. The lad presenting this video has a slight UK accent tbh.
But what about Scottish accent.. that one is impossible
I can understand them if they slowed it down a little bit. My Merican brain works slow. But I definitely understand what they’re saying when it sounds clear Hahahahaah
Hi I know I’m late but jack react to Conor McGregor pushing his accent than normal
Jack I got a question  I am Irish but I do not have accent   does all Irish people have accents can you please tell me
Nah seán every Kilometer there's a different accent 😂😂
Does he not know blindboy?😮😮😮
you need to do another one and rate rdr2’s sean irish accent
I can't believe tha'ts english
I wish Jack would have finished the Irish accent cartoon video, because in that video he goes on to talk about Irish people in the north and how they're more on the Scottish side, and he actually does reference the Frostbit guy as an example.  Classic Jack video to come back to, these types of vids really make me smile.
The banshees of inisherin had the best irish cast
Glaswegian is the sexiest, hands down.
I know this is a super late comment, But there are thirty to forty different accents on the republic of ireland, Which is the highest concentration of accents in the world. Saying you're going to speak with an irish accent is like saying africa is a country.
5:24 *Five farty sheeps
0:18 "The Irish Accent Voted Sexiest In The World 2020" AUGUST 1, 2019… 2019?! 🤯
I love how the reporters name for RTE is all caps, but then there is one small t at the beginning of his (?) family name ?  It's like they knew the internet was coming and decided having it all in cap was too agressive.
if there is an real movie of crash bandicoot jack can do neo cortex
Holy F you blend right in if you went to Newfoundland.
The Canadian equivalent  of the sheep guy is a hardcore Newfie LOL
I had an Irish (Born in and had family in Ireland) girlfriend but she sounded posh English because she lived near London most of her life and people would say she isn't Irish . I said she is Irish she just doesn't sound that way.
7:38 surprisingly I made out most of what they were saying , but some Scottish accents ( local) I’ve had a hard time understanding mostly because it was slang .
Hes like a canadian watching a video on newfies.  We're quite similar. The cork accent is definitely here in Newfoundland.
As a French-Canadian practicing english right now . The sheep keeper was max level  of difficulty
It's not only Ireland that has accents, I'm Swedish and my grandfather was from way out in the woods, middle of nowhere. When he came to the "big city" to visit us people couldn't understand half of what he was saying. I think we had to do some light translating here and there, but he could make himself understood.  Funny thing, him and grandma went to visit USA without knowing much English, so I guess he could transcend language barriers. How two middle aged Swedes got all the way to Hawaii with as much English ability as I have in my left pinky I'll never know.
Farty five and frost butt really got me😂
Sheep man be sounding Scandinavian…. 😂
as an australian with people who always get our accent wrong, I completely understand that first part
lol I understand most of these and for some reason us in Newfoundland sound very similar and the accents change from town to town
How can any accent be bad. It's rude to criticize a persons accent. Be proud of heritage.
There is a difference between a strong accent and simply not able to speak properly
An saoil thu gu bheil na sràcan nas làidire air sgàth 's gu bheil blas Gàidhlig aca?
Jacksepticye is like an irishman who forgot how to be irish
I don’t find it hard to understand but then again… I’ve been all over the southern part of America.
Brad Pitt is playing a pikey. And his performance is actually pretty universally recognized as fantastic.
last video was amazing
We took an dna test and we found out my mom was 97 percent Irish and my dad I forget but he is also very Irish and we are mostly from mayo county
ss
Sss
Donegal accent is the best 💚☘️
RTE all day errday
Proud to be irish
5:25 Farty five
Brad Pitt was doing a pikey accent, he nailed it..
I actually felt like the brad pitt one was ok not perfect but ok
I could understand the rowers but not the farmers, jesus man they’re accents are stronger than bourbon
Brad Pity has a Pikey accent in that movie.
Am I the only one who thinks the French accent should’ve been way lower on the list of sexy accents?
Limrick is just nogla
ahh thats a shame there is a portion of irish gaelige in the sheep video, i was wondering what would be your reaction to that, shame you skipped it haha
“TELL ME YOU LIKE ME HAT”  -Tom Cruise-
The guy who lost the sheep sounded Turkish help like I literally understood him when he was talking but in Turkish😭
This isnt pekins chat...
Oirland? Who the fuck says Oirland? Also, where I live in Canada people pronounce 'mirror' as 'mirrr'. Actually, we slur a lot of sounds together, like how 'I think foreigners get really confused about the language here' sounds like 'Thing forners git really cnfuse bou th lang wej ere'. N I wouln ave i any othe way.
0:27 As someone who kind of had a French accent from speaking it a lot, I'm offended. ( not really )
As a kerry-man, I understood everything, I dont know what yer on about
The farmers are like the Cajun Louisiana accent for irish people
As an italian it felt bad to get "second best"
What the actual feck?
American 🙋🏼‍♀️ I love the Irish accent, and believe it or not I DID understand a good bit of what these men said😁 I’d trade any Irish person to switch with me ANYDAY! You come to America (East Coast- South, 5 miles from beach,damn HOT all the feckin time even CHRISTMAS 🤦‍♀️🙄) and I’ll GLADLY and gratefully live in Ireland…. Just not Dublin please 🤷‍♀️. I love rain, cold weather and mountains ( seriously- no joke). I listened to TodayFM on my computer at one of my jobs everyday😁 I loved trying to guess where the person was calling in from just by their accent. I learned quickly. I don’t unfortunately know Gaelic, but hell , I took French two years and failed in school so🤷‍♀️. I miss Shane MacGowan, I like Damian Dempsey, and obsessed with Two Door Cinema Club ❤️ I dearly miss Tony Fenton 😢 my heart aches, he was such a great radio DJ, so kind, he always responded when I’d send little notes when he was out and returned to work, I didn’t learn till right before he left, he was dealing with cancer 💔 I leave this as my last thought about Tony, he was always positive, kind, and elegant gentleman throughout his battle. The one song I’ll always attribute to him was Elbows “Looking like a Beautiful Day” he interviewed them, he seemed to like that song and I thought “what a strong man to be going through this hardship with his health and rather than wallowing in pity, he finds simple things and pleasures like this song and the positive feelings it gives you “ ❤️ RIP Tony Fenton ,you’ll never be forgotten (even 3635 miles away)
6:04 bro there is no way anybody could have understood even this first sentence, i'm convinced you just adlibbed that
Scottish people can also have a pretty mad accent less frostbit more like an angry lawnmower
Sons of anarchy Belfast accents are absolutely hilarious. ”sorey jimmey, thet aall wen to sheitt.” - Liam O’neil
Mirrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
❤ ✿❧🌿❧✿ ❤
I am Irish and I talk like that lol
Ah yes the worst insult Jack could think of. "Drink your milk child!"
It doesn’t sound Irish to you 😉 definitely sounds Irish to non Irish people 😂
it's like it's a whole different language when the accent is so thick 😂😂😂 i love the final video we saw btw
In brads defense he was playing a pikey who can sound like that.
I don’t hear a difference between jack and all the others in the video 😊
I swear to god I can do the irish accent. You'll have to splice together multiple takes tho, it's very hard to stay on the rails without veering off into welsh, scottish or the way peasants in age of empires speak when you click them. I don't know the Dr. House cheat codes for it where you speak in an accent nobody has but nobody can object to. That's the magic.
Frostbet kid has grown into the handsome Frostbet man. Seriously! Look it up! He's a total stud!
The sheep farmer lives in an area in which the Irish (Gaelic) language has remained the first language, in the same clip you can hear his neighbours speaking Irish. He is difficult for many people to understand because unlike the majority of Irish people he has strong Gaelic influence on his English.   It is rare that people are exposed to the most diverse of Irish/Hiberno English dialects on the national (Dublin centric) television stations and it is quite sad that the reflex of many Irish young people is to laugh and make jokes about the way older people in particular areas speak. My fathers family are from Kerry, can understand the man perfectly and really don't understand the reaction to a dialect which to them growing up was not abnormal.
its only because people dont enunciate their words, and the syllables that were enounce are in the wrong ones.
bro the 3rd one, cc cant EVEN UNDERSTAND IT- thats how heavy it is
Well, Brad Pitt wasn't playing an Irishman, he was playing a pikey which has very little if not nothing to do with actual Ireland. It's British gypsies and their accent doesn't really sound Irish because it's not and it doesn't have to be.
sounds a bit jamaican sometimes
Thanks. Now I'm going to imagine walken's horrible accent when I watch Dune.
My german brain has some damage now. Why did I watch this😩
the farmer sounds like he’s speaking simlish
I wonder if Jack's ever seen "Darby O Gill and the Little People."
I've got a lot of Irish friends and listen to a lot of Irish music, so I've unintentionally ended up using a lot of Irish expressions and mannerisms in my speech, so I've got a bit of a bastardized American accent that sounds very vaguely Irish.
Jeff went on about he didn't find the irish accent sexy, heard one woman say "hi" and was immediately ready to get down on one knee. Have some self respect, jeff please
French was 4th? People like the sound of pure arrogance?
I’m from GA (SE America) and this is literally the same dialect…  Example: Mirror in a southern accent is just Mirrer.  Oil is Errl  Doritos is Deritaz  Water is Wadda  Etc…
There was a point when I swore that the sheep farmer said “45 sheep” and something about his wife… turns out he said “what can be done about it? Nothin”
Pitt's is actually pretty authentic and at least consistent. Actually an underrated actor. Chameleon you might say
Hey Jacksepticeye wait till you go to Newfoundland 😂
Sean! We need a part 2!)
My mum once saw a video of some guy who could guess where and how a person grew up by the way they speak and she thought he'd be bollocksed with my family because despite us all growing up in the same household and, Hell, me and my sister being identical twins, we all have different accents.  According to my brother, my sister and other brother sound British, I sound American and he's the only one who sounds Irish.
Back 3 years later! I love what you do...
I'd like to see a conversation between an Irish Farmer and Boomhauer.
🤣🤣🤣
Hilarious!  My mum is from Ireland and I'm Irish-American.  Growing up she used to get so annoyed by bad Irish Accents lol  Especially the Irish Spring Soap commercial.  Too funny.
I know this is an older video...but I think it would make for an AMAZING follow-up if you rated your follower's attempts at an "Irish" accent. 😅
see this is why irish people weren't considered white white over a century ago. oppressed for the accent
Ulysses is 1000 times funnier knowing the characters have an Irish accent
I'm still most fascinated by Sean being able to say a W with an h in front. "HWhy"
the third one didn't even sound like an irish accent or english at all, it just straight up sounded like a foreign language 💀
dielek?!?!? EXTERMINATE
With the farmer one, you know it's a super thick accent when they're speaking the same language as you and you *still* need a translation.
First time i met irish people, i had to share a room with 2 guys. I was convinced they were from like eastern europe until they said they were from Ireland.
As a German, Vhat ze Fack
Why does Pitt’s Irish accent sound like Sean in RDR2
Is no one going to talk about how the sheep had the star power up
I’m Irish, Scottish, and Scandinavian. This is my dopamine refill
"How to speak Irish"  Jack: ".... what?"  Also, as someone from kentucky with that accent, a lot of people where i live now ask me if I'm from Georgia our Tennessee like no, very different things 😂
I actually met this sheep farmer … nice guy but didn’t understand a word he said
I was having a hard time figure what the hell yur wan was saying about losen his sheep
Man, I have to give Brad Pitt props for that. He's making a hell of a better effort than most.
Jack did you play GAA when you were younger
North Dublin is the sexiest voice
I think he sounds normal, but I'm Irish so...
Sexiest accent in the world?  Who voted on that, all the Irish? 🤣🤣🤣  When I hear someone with an Irish accent, I step away, cuz I know a tantrum follows that tone.
Are you sure he not speaking gealiac
Wait, so where in Ireland is Sean from?
How to speak with an Irish accent: 1. Down a flask. 2. Talk fast as you dare 3. ????!llanofairigog???oireflair??? 55. Apply hangover remedy, return to step 1.
Yeah... It is hard to get it correct.
No longer top of the morning it's bottom of the evening
7:58 is literally on the UTV (Ulster Television) Ulster is Northern Ireland, and Northern Ireland is British. As usual, typical Gael colonisers trying to take credit and pave over the native Ulster-Scots. Disgraceful.
Man now I want to see a video of a native French speaker trying to translate creole... time for another late night YouTube click hole
more oirlend
My dad and I went to Ireland ages ago when I was 13 (from the US). We were out by some lakes in Kerry and I can’t remember if my dad asked for directions or just started talking to this guy but an old man standing in a dingy in the lake was sorta shout-talking to us and even though this was almost 20 years ago I still remember it just sounding like a bunch of Irish noise and being confused. To this day the image of a yelling Irishman in the dingy is still burned into my brain. I think my dad just nodded and pretended he understood 😂
6:10 this is literally like hot fuzz when the officer needed a translator. edit, literally sean said that right after i made the comment. god damn it.
Мой английский не очень хорош, так что я, вероятно, звучу как они
You thought Brad Pitt’s Irish was off, wait till you see Far and Away   I read that in Ireland, it’s considered a comedy
I heard what Gaelige sounds like and its sad that its sort of dying out.
Some were easier to understand than others
I love the Irish accents, my Grandfather came from Belfast, we never realized he had an accent because we were around him daily, but other people couldn't understand him. We kids picked up his accent.  I was in Ireland last week and I already miss it.
I’m from cork(north side) and my family’s from all over the country and I can’t understand a word of them farmers🇮🇪💀
at the sheep part, i did hear him say "Its not all that difficult"
Tbf I'm sure the lady is teaching people how to do something that seems like an irish accent for acting purposes.
havent been in skibb in a fat wan now like but all i saw there was just fucking water lol
I feel like when an American is asked to do an Irish. They will do a Cork accent. Just like when a non-American  is asked to do an American accent. 9 times outa 10. They will do a southern accent. And that 1 time, they'll do like a thick New Yorker accent.
12:29 I once told this American girl that I was English and she was arguing with me because I “don’t have an English accent”
0:36 he looses his accent here.
Watch Shaggy reviewing Jamaican accents and Holy moly is it funny how Americanized the accents were so they were understandable but still respectable to the accent and it being distinguishable.
ewes
You know, jazz and comedy are the only two places anymore where we can appreciate different cultures in an irreverent or imperfect way.
8:00-8:33 believe it or not this is the ONLY way I'm able to watch the frostbit video cause it's not allowed to be shown in the U.S. for some reason
Thought he was a gypsy in snatch?
The Irish farmers accent kinda reminds me of some sort of Austrian accent.
God it's like someone from the south translating bayou or Appalachian accents
Honestly I've noticed that your accent has decreased a *lot* over the years
I wonder, have you ever watched the movie Boondock Saints?  I think you'd like it but also, check out how well Norman Reedus did with his Irish accent!  It's one of my favourite movies of all time! 💚
I like how Collin Farrel speaks 🎉🎉🎉
11:53 she did not say flower or flour, she said flare
jak slightly got more and more Irish as the video went on
Coming back to this now and I think it's important to remember that with Brad Pitt's one, he's playing an Irish gypsy from the backarse of nowhere through generations of questionable practises, and the whole gimmick is that no one can understand him anyway so idk if that makes a difference but there
You shouldn't be talking you started with solid snake impressions look where that got you... wait
Thank you for translating the stolen sheep video. 😂😂 I understood "sheep" and that was it.
The fact that you were able to translate that and show off some of your Irish roots was pretty cool
If I listened closely I could understand the Olympic rowers just fine, but I'm used to hearing an Appalachian accent from family.
As a blind person, I have an easier time understanding sign-language, than this.
Now that I’m listening to this I can pick out the Cork accent in callmekevin’s videos versus Jack’s.
And i thought having to listen to a bavarian was hard
he drunk or high
The sheep farmer I he is speaking straight gibberish 😂😅
where i’m from, our accent is irish and canadian 😅
jack is not hard to understand but i will admit that he does break in his irish accent when he is speaking  i would say the best way is to travel to a place where the majority of people speak irish and listen to it and absorb it
for a while I thought I had a pretty good Irish accent, but now I'm second guessing myself...
My ancestors were outlawed from Scotland for being sheep stealers. I never realized this was such a prevalent problem. 😂
The cork accent would be alot different if she had North sider cork accent
The American southern accent is also one that is both loved and hard to understand if it's too thick 🤣
No no you’re very clear. These guys… I am so thankful you’re translating!
THAT MOVIE SOUNDS ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE
Jamie was actually born in Ireland too. And is naturally Irish. 😂
Pitt doesnt play an irish man. He plays a pikey. I guess your saying thats irish.... like wtf
5000 men and women.  Yes. That is indeed “the world” -.-
Omg the kerry accent, you gotta listen to it twice but 😂 lmaoo
I’m in Cork for my post-grad and the cork bits have me absolutely cackling
11:52 actually sounded Northern Irish
PARK.  GARDEN.  FECK.  ARSE.
It's obvious to anyone *from* Northern Ireland that the frostbit guy wasn't an accent, it was a bit.  That's how old (like 80+) people from round here all talk.
Jack does have the sexiest Irish accent lol I agree with that
"Eat shit, France!"  Not even three minutes in. Thank you Jack.
You should react to the Newfoundland(Newfie) accent. We are Ireland lite.
Weird thing, I am Polish but I was born in Ireland, currently live in Ireland, have never left Ireland and I have interracted with Irish people since I was a toddler but I never developed an Irish accent. But then again I'm a mildly autistic left-handed girl that gets excited about snakes like others do about puppies so I guess weird things are just normal for me.  Also I've stared at grass so long I found a FIVE leaf clover (sorry, just had to flex that).
its the way the farmer just kept saying stuff in the background
As a Wexford, I can listen to what your man is saying
brad pitt did the pikey accent sure like its not enlish not irish
Is it weird that i fully understood everything he was saying? Mind yiu i did spend three years or so in co.cork...makes me wanna go back as miss ireland...england doesnt really feel like home to me...not like ireland does...
he shouldve watched the rest of the last video, norn iron is a proper class accent
Bro paused and had to be careful what he said about Scotland 😂
The waffle house greets you.
bro started his video with a scream
look at his hair
Me hearing the sheep farmers accent: Whoa you can speak in cursive?
Irish people don't say, "top o mornin to ya" Yet Jack says it all the time.
The rowers trip me out because their mouths dont move. At all. Fucking insane.
I am from Ireland and I love the Irish
Jack is the real irishman.
guys this whole time i never knew he was irish, i never watched his channel before but ive heard of him and i just found out hes irish-
In Irish I lived here all my life and I pretty much had a stroke trying to understand the man who lost his sheep
This just makes me want to move to Ireland even more
Fun Fact: Facts Channel is gone and they started The Try Channel and it’s even better content now
There is only one line in one video Sean has ever said that to this day I cannot understand, and the captions conveniently skip over. It's in his LN2 playthrough after he flees from the Thin Man through the train, and he starts climbing up a ladder. I've watched that snippet so many times and only come back with ????
I love how the news in Ireland is just farmer in Kerry looses sheep lol
Please review the Irish accents on the show Warrior, especially Leary's and Bill's. I know quite a few of the actors playing Irish characters are British, but in many cases it's not their native accent.
i don't know maybe i'm half irish, but i could make out a lot of what the farmer said
im convinced irish is its own language
My Great Gran came over from Dublin.
5:02 as a scot, I could understand this man bout 1/2 the time
My family are of Cork (Very South) and every single one of them sounds just like the farmer from the video
5:55 the fact he can translate that at all is insane
Scotland and Ireland got the hardest accents and the best were on top
I can do an ok Irish accent, but my Scottish sounds like  drunk Scrooge McDuck. Lol
Honestly i think Mel Gibson did a better Scottish accent then the actors in Wild Mountain Time 😂
is féidir liom an feirmeoir a sheasamh mar Éireannach
Ngl that Irish farmer has a dope accent
Nice, i have the sexiest acsent in the world. Is a sin go hálainn
They try and do you when you had a strong accent so like early on in your youtube career your accent was strong asf
Wouldnt be surpirsed if the news one day was like: The guinneas has spilled all over the floor in __________ pub in county ___________ and the rats drank it and are now very drunk, one has been caught by scientists and is in for testing. I know this video is like 2 years old but. 💀
Irish person: "ah, ye would'nt tu longe get'n froastbit"  Also Irish person: "the f*ck did you just say?"
Irish person: "ah, ye would'nt tu longe get'n froastbit"  Also Irish person: "the f*ck did you just say?"
Buddy acts like he doesn’t talk like that off camera
Sean has the best Irish accent
irish yeah!!!!!
Jack translating is just the best thing ever lol
I’m from county Kerry and could hardly understand that sheep farmer😂
I can't say which is my favourite, but most of the Irish people I know are from Cork, so I'm possibly more familiar with that one. I'd take any of them over my own (born in Northumberland, so nearly a Geordie, lived in Yorkshire as a kid, then lived in Edinburgh for 30 years, but can't lose the Englishness). On the other hand, I've been all over, and the strong accent of that farmer was only a little harder to follow than the Shetlanders I meet when I visit my in-laws.
I’ll never forget years ago, working a merchandise stand at a rugby game between Ireland and New Zealand. ( why the match was being held at soldier field in Chicago I have no idea lol ) but trying to understand the irish people there when they asked me questions, it was so funny to me. Specifically when they asked about youth sized jerseys. They say it like “yewt” I probably asked the guy to repeat it 10 times before I figured out what the hell he was saying. Lmao to be fair, I’m sure I sounded weird to them with my Chicago accent. Accents are just funny as hell.
The farmer sounds almost swedish
6:46 fortneit
This is an extra great watch since I'm stuck on the train cuz there's some sheep run off and grouping together on the train. The conductor just told us the police has been called to assist in the removal of the sheep but one keeps giving them the slip 😂
i agree with everything said here
The fact that you can actually understand what they are saying is a gift.  .. ps. you have the sexiest Irish accent.
*froshbet*
Park, garden, feck.
My Dad was Irish, Ive got this.
2:23Jack turns into some one from Brooklyn
Im 2 years late to this video so hopefully someone sees this comment. We were allegedly voted sexiest accent in the world... but which accent? Because I have a Belfast accent and mate let me tell you, this is not a sexy accent. Wish you didn't cut the video at the end... he was getting to the Belfast accent
4:51 as someone who has family from Kerry and grew up in cork, I can roughly understand the accent, but it cracks me up when someone attempts an accent 😭✋🏻
🇮🇪 Ireland: Most beautifull accent.   🇱🇹 Lithuania: Highest depression/alcoholism levels in europe.
hey jack you should check out how they talk in parts of Newfoundland over here in Canada its like the irlend of canada
No making fun of ireland I live AndI’m from ireland
This video made me happy 😂🤣🤣  Edit: It's really not fair of Seán  to flex on us with his accent lool Man I wish I could do Irish accent 😅
im part irish, native american, mexican, british, and only god knows what else
Australian accents are the hottest
if anyone wants to here the thickest cork accents known to man look up evenflow, funny videos and gas to listen to
Irish tour?
I think I might be part Irish bc I kinda have 1 of those accents
I'm irish living in kerry, and I'm not going to lie. That's all I hear all day
I'm Irish and I cud only understand about 10% of that farmer
Im Scottish so finding out we’re 3rd for sexiest accent is quite gid if you ask me
Me when he was playing the farmer*   Jack* translates what he says: I lost all my sheep and I think someone stole then  Me* when I try and translate: a loost oll meah shape I ata thank sambooty stoool dem ( he didn’t actually say that I was using an example for a joke sorry if it wasn’t funneh)    btw this guy might aswell be a drunk American cause that’s what they sound like😂
Holy shit Seán if you can understand that farmer you can understand anything.
45 sheep missing is still more newsworthy than that time a TV station from Sicily reported a roadkill cow.
the fact that i'm Australian, and somehow understood most of what the farmer was saying.
"why am I promoting this fucking thing?". 😭😭😭
Lol aww I wanna see more of these vids  Him being a proud Irish
Honestly at this point in life I wanna leave USA and move to Ireland and learn how to be a chef there and live happily
There were points during the video of the Irish man with his sheep that it genuinely sounded like he was speaking fluent Welsh! You could’ve have told me his whole section was in Welsh and I would’ve been none the wiser 🤣🤣🤣
Jack: Everything down in Cork is just great! Me: ...Why does this sound like Lee Mack doing a Lancashire accent?  "Proper Lancashire is surprised to hell about everything all the time."
Its the same with the British its completely different once you get into Newcastle, Lincoln, Liverpool,Wigan,Cornwall we all have our own Accent nearly all the Americans think we all speak the same
As soon as Seán paused on the “Kerry” woman I was like wait why’d she sound British?!?
The old man in the beanie talking about his sheep sounds like Mr.Mushroom from Hollow Knight. XD
Sean, I love when you do videos like this!!!! And I love that you are getting such a big kick out of the whole thing! I visited Ireland once back in 2005, and spent most of it in County Cork... I found everyone mostly understandable... LOL!! It is the most beautiful country on this earth though... I can't wait to go back!! And your accent is just gorgeous!! Loves!! <3
The second one was more of a Carlo accent
A southern Irish man and a southern American man are kind of one of the same they have a thick accent that no one can understand unless you can speak it so my theory is anyone that come from a South part of a country has a thick accent. I can name several more examples if I could think of the names
At least we Scot’s are the 3rd sexiest unlike the French 🖕🏻 you Frenchies!
5:03 this is rigged he’s not speaking any dialect of English I refuse to believe it
I was born irish and I haven't got an irish accent I have an naerican one I don't listen to irish I don't listen in class etheir ok
I love the Irish accent always have always will
i really like the cork accent, its really smooth. also could someone explain where grounds keeper willy is supposed to be from in the Simpsons?
The only thing I heard from the Irish sheep herder was "coconut milk elytra"
I'm 15% Irish.  :)
irish accent has a good influence on a new england accent
I’m Irish and cringing so so so bad. I struggle watching movies with the accent 😂😂 so this is a lot for me
I'm Irish but I grew up in America so I have 0 irish accent
Brad Pitt’s was, I suppose, in the “uncanny valley” of Irish accents.
Can you translate The Banshees of Inishirin? I’m pretty good with accents but I’m fuckin lost there
Jack legit sounds like gru at 2:21 its uncanny lmao
My teacher was trying to find a video for saint Patrick's day and he put this video without knowing it had bad words in it
The northern kids is amazing
As an Irish person, I can translate SOME of it, but is just so funny how we talk😅
9:40 I live 20 minutes away from skibbereen. And my friend rows in the rowing club where they both rowed
yk im two years late to discovering this video. but as a kid who was born and lived in glasgow for a few years i can understand approx 30% of the sheep guys accent xd
Ah, jesus. The elder people in Lú you can't understand what they're saying. Someone came up to me saying "hosdswesharopdaershon" he was actually asking me what's the weather up there, son.
We have our own version of this in Belgium They are called West-Flemish people
20:00 That looks like one of the members of The Rubberbandits. Screw your Mistubishi, they've a horse outside!
Jacksepticeye talking about bad Irish accents, my vocal cords after I watch 3 of his videos trying to mimic him.
Try to do an American accent. "Question, What state? What town? Are you imitating someone who grew up there or moved? It gets very complicated when accents are involved.
Guys I think Sean is from Southern Ireland
First video was closer to Scottish than irish
I’m Irish but people say that I have a British- australien accent ( sorry if I spelled anything wrong)
9:14 this part glitched my Siri
FARTy Faive!!
blindboy!
Im the Irish Swagmaster but I'm burn in America
I'm Irish and scottish
Slowly as this video progresses, Sean starts slowly slipping further and further into a thicker Irish accent and he doesnt even notice
I love how Sean's accent just kept getting thicker over the video.
6:43 what I heard: "....some of a good job, you're joggin, Fortnite and moonshine light, just to be dragged around em, my trailer's walkin"
I’m convinced that the mad Irish farmer isn’t speaking English. He’s speaking Irish.
Ok. I could understand everyone pretty well.  Brad Pitt is playing an Irish Travler their accent is different  but he is accurate. Everyone was delightful.  What the hell is up with the spelling on the reporters name!!
how to do an irish accent was like a derry accent
Proud to be from Kerry 💪💪💪
The guy with the bag on his head at the end was meant to be one of the guys from an Irish musical comedy group called The Rubberbandits.
This video has convinced me that Irish is a separate language, not an accent.
Imagine being me with both strong Scottish & Irish blood running through me but a 1/14 of Italian blood ruins my accent..;-;
i went to the southern part of ireland and i found not a single person who sounded like this thank JESUS.
American and Part Irish- I wish I had an accent 😭❤
My grandpa is polish American, and he is the only person I know that says top of the morning
the big foot of the spoken world. yes.
WELL I WAS BORN IN A DUBLIN STREET
Have you seen Luck of the Irish? That'd be a good movie reaction
Brad pit sounds Northern Irish in snatched
You move a meter and they sound like this I GoTiin tO THe Frm
"You're lucky you're gorgeous." 😂😂😂
"I'm great at this" maybe it's because you are Irish?
I can't do Irish accent but filipino accent and english accent I know so well a
The farmer sounds like my dad drunk losing a poker game
Irish isnt an accent but a dialect... Seems noone understands the difference anymore 😬🤷🏼
Farty foive? That's a mad load o' sheep!
One time I scolded my cat in an Irish accent (I’m not Irish, I’m a born American of Scots/Irish descent) for fighting with his brother through the cat door
jamaican and irish accents are so similar
love u sean and this isnt ur fault but that list was all white countries lmfao
At the crack of the dawn thunder and lightning crossed the way The shadow of knight waited to see the bright light of the day Nobody saw his bitter tears through the dark veil of rain The river of blood under his feet run wild again and again  The green roses will grow While green fields turn to red Only memory remains Of hero and his faith  He just stood and he stared with a sword in his hand Under the bridge of rainbow's gold he fought for his land The black crow stole his destiny and flew from the cross Flyin' high, goin' so far to take his soul away  The green roses will grow While green fields turn to red Only memory remains Of hero and his faith  At the crack of the dawn thunder and lightning crossed the way The shadow of knight waited to see the bright light of the day Nobody saw his bitter tears through the dark veil of rain The river of blood under his feet run wild again and again  The green roses will grow While green fields turn to red Only memory remains Of hero and his faith
Just jack saying I’m great at this at 11:32 is the funniest thing ever
JAMIE DORNAN IS IRISH. But walken is walken
That’s insane. I listened intensely. Even after Jack told me what he was saying, I still couldn’t hear it. How tf
flower = floeur
With the sheep man I understud what he was saying unless he got really mumbly
im sorry but the irish accent is one of the most unattractive lol, Australian and Scottish are insanely more attractive
Why does southern Irish kinda similar to Jamaican in intonation
“It’s just M, I, and 15 R’s” 😂
Christopher Walken trying to do an Irish accent sounds like an Irish person trying to do a Christopher Walken impression
We love you Sean! I thought the term Taking the piss was a british term. When you said it it confused me. Is it irish too? Or did you move to the UK? I didn't even know you moved out of Ireland.
18:06 wow that video is much better than the one with the fake irish girl that sounded more brit :P
I thought British was sexier than Irish so I was surprised by that 2020 rank.
Sean says Park okay but Garden .. ya definitely still Irish but just not as strong as it used to be :P
Hey it is pretty good he has over 50% subscribers. I have seen other youtubers complain they don't even have 10% that are pretty popular.
7:50 actually Sean .. you do .. or at least you did in your older videos.
eee
give me my shyeap ack
Omg Im Irish😂 and that man I can just about understand
The Irish accent is as elusive as the West Virginia accent. (Jodi Foster doesn’t sound a thing like us by the way)
I love how she said try this with me and Seán just starts talking normal and i love yhe way he says flower this isnt Jack this is Seán in his truest form😂😂
Anytime someone asks "why didn't they cast actual..." it's because they're trying to make the most money... That's also the answer to almost any question today O.o
05:50. He sounds more like a Scotsman than an Irishman. Because he pronounces a hard ”r” instead of a soft ”r”.
Meanwhile every russian gangster in movies speaking elvish or something...
The fact that old man had a kid next to him and that kid looks so…normal 😂 like that kid just understood every fucking word that old man said like HUH?!
a stong irish accent just sounds like a really drunk irish person that isn't drunk at all
Why is this so interesting
Love Ireland 🇮🇪 from England 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 🇬🇧🇬🇷🇹🇷
Irish accent is basically English speaking doctors' handwriting
the farmer basically said a it was bra bricht moonlit nicht
''scatter cushions'' what? 🤣
5:32 I literally didn’t hear one comprehensible word lmao
I'm proud of myself for understanding most of what the farmer was saying on the first try
The Irish accent is the European version of the southern accent and no one can prove me wrong.
i neeeeed to know if hes seen derry girls !!!!
that vocal coach bit was over the top
those irish rowers were my fave ;)
Irish accents are completely different from each other
I think he is speaking simish
Whenever i try to do an irish accent it gradually turns into a scottish or sometimes australia accent
You should check out Newfoundland accent it'll blow your mind
yuppa kildare
Oh god what accent am i listening to
I've seen one of the irish rowers on Graham Norton and it was so much fun :) I watched it with a friend and we're both German. I grew up in a part of Germany with a heavy accent and she didn't. It was a blast because I understood the man as if he'd been my neighbour and she made no effort to even listen :)
I literally only do an Irish accent when saying 32, totally accidental.  I'm not even Irish
Mirrrrŕrrrrrrŕrrrrrrrrr you say?
The snatch one is just a mouth full of socks.
Cork! Loved those accents! And as an American, Irish is my favorite “foreign” accent, closely followed by Australian
Love this video ❤️😀
He died a pint
Holy f
That's a real sean
😘
But I am from Kerry
I understand everything
As someone who grew up around people from West Virginia US it is about as hard to understand some of the locals 🤣🤣
I’m from Arkansas and sometimes I have to translate the Arkansan for my non Arkansan friends XD
I’m actually going to Ireland Monday for two weeks haha, hopefully I can meet new friends and maybe a girlfriend haha 😢
I'm Irish but have an American accent 😮‍💨
The first vid Americans will probably think that's how we sound
My Irish friend taught me one phrase : " fekaf ye gobshite". I believe it's a traditional Irish greeting
I’m Irish American
18:33 this  woman is a rapper 😂
"A powerful TING." 🤣
"Stop having your EARS under a ROCK, _Jeff."_
This was awesome, I’m trying to tune my ear to the accent since I’m visiting soon and would like to avoid asking people to repeat or slow down.
The accent of the sheep man is what all english sounds like to me when my brain is not letting me process words.
IMAGINE NOT BEING FROM THE COUNTRY WITH THE SEXIEST ACENT IN THE WORLD 2020  LETS FREAKING GO !!!!
``He had a rock tied to his neck`` Jack becomes Gru for a moment there.
Your grip of the American accent being Irish is well done. To be fair American isn’t a well sought after accent, we love your accent much more. Pretty much anyone else’s accent tbh
You need to watch the part in Hellboy 2 where the prince kills his father. Plus he, his sister, and his father speak Gaelic. Is that another form of Irish?
There's this strange phenomenon where if your from one county and go to another for a week and speak to their people, your accent meshes with theres. IT SOUNDS LIKE SHITE WHEN IT HAPPENS. The dubs and the donegals are the most infectious.
OMG. The last 3 minutes of this were gold. 😄😄😄 Yes, I laughed, but I really learned so much about Irish accents. This was FUN.
Wait until he sees that Afrikaans is ranked second sexiest language. Greetings from South Africa btw, love your videos.
I come back to this video for a good laugh😂
Irish culture is the best in the world!!❤🇮🇪🇮🇪
This reminds me of the accent Gerald has on Clarkson's Farm. Don't believe he's Irish but his accent is so strong I always get so lost, and Jeremy Clarkson's reactions to it is hilarious cuz he doesn't understand either🤣
PÓG MO THÓIN, SEÁN! ❤
Sean thinks he's translating ppl that speak his language. Little does he know, they just sound shitfaced & half of us can already understand.
I'm laktose intolerante
Hot take: Jacksepticeye is ultimately a corporate scumbag dog who leeches off of people and has become a snobby rich Mick. You'd think an Irish person like Jack would use his money and massive influence to talk about the famines in Ethiopia, Yemen, Afghanistan, Somalia, and pretty much every other country throughout Africa and the Middle East his people helped colonize and destroy when the Potato eaters were part of the British Empire. What's even more shameful is that Jack's ancestors were starving to death and dying during the Great potato famines orchestrated by the English so you'd think Jack himself would be sympathetic towards the horrific plight of starving and dying Arabs and Africans. Jack is a hypocrite and his ancestors are cursing him out in the afterlife. Jack sure doesn't care if Palestinians are being genocided by the Zionist demons and forced out of their homes, Jack an irishman couldn't possibly resonate with those people because "the darkies were built for it". The Irish played a large part in destroying Africa during colonialism. Hell during the famines in Ireland the Irish were flooding into the USA as refugees and immigrants in waves and took over the country and took over all of our institutions and started using their newfound privileges and political powers to start being racist and oppressive towards Chinese, blacks, Mexicans, and other groups of people they viewed as inferior. What's ironic is that the Irish in the USA were literally horribly discriminated against and called "white N word" and were seen as people of color. The fact this potato head has more wealth and is living the dream while black people here in these impoverished ghettos are starving and living in constant misery makes my blood boil. They were right when they said that the Irish are a menace because they do nothing but leech off of hard working people like me who have been stepped on for too long. I wish the US navy had sunk all those boats full of Irish refugees and drowned them all. Jack tries to come off as a progressive but he's just a racist monkey like the rest of these ultra rich and wealthy YouTubers. How many refugees from the Middle East and Africa did Jack fund and help financially? Does Jack know that his country Ireland took part in the sacking of Iraq which resulted in up to one million Iraqis being murdered? I used to feel sorry for the Irish then I realized that they're also just as racist as the Polacks, Ivans, Urks, and other Europeans. The entirety of Europe is built on hypocrisy, greed, and callousness. Human rights my ass.
I COULD UNDERSTAND THE FARMER FIEND
For a person with German as her first language, Irish and Scottish are the worst to understand. Its catastrophic
so this is the Irish equivalent to brits trying to understand Winston Churchill lol
He should listen to seamus moore
I work in the airport MAdrid so  I hear lots of languages ... the farmer dude reealy sounded to me like some Iceland Finish Norway any of those old Vikings countries
That Kerry girl had the same type of accent as Maisie Williams
I'm American, but I'm used to hearing a lot of different accents, so I could fully understand the rowing guys, the student, and the newscaster.  I could only understand about 75% of what the farmers were saying 😂.  What I'm wondering is if they can fully understand someone that enunciates 🤣.
I feel like non-Irish actors acting Irish are the same as when non-swedish actors do a swedish accent, always just sounds like they're german speaking english..like just hire swedish actors that can speak english...
Best Irish translator right here
so, Irish people are Irish?
hilarious holy i could not stop laughing
That's like people with really hard-core southern draws lol. When I was in the military there was a guy that I went to basic training, AIT, and then to my unit with that nobody could understand, but me lol. People would literally ask me to translate and it was hilarious lol.
This makes me wanna learn the Irish accent, I'm American. Also I wanna learn the Polish or Russian accents
haha funny thing i can actually understand them  all, and i  am not even native english  speaker.. reason why, well in last 10 or so  years so many people from my country lfet to ireland and stayed there at the end, many ae my friends and insane thing is,  where they live determined their accents, way they speak etc. they picked it up and when they come  here they often forgot they are not in ireland and just  start to speak in english, i sometimes reply in  english or in croatian and they just continue in english, coz they are there for so long.. depending on the region where they live determined their accent.. with time i  kinda learned  all the accents and can understand them... also  gaming with  bunch of irish lads helped in that...
I'm Irish but born in America can but do you consider me to be Irish?
i catch certain words here and there but with that THICC accent i really can't understand the irish farmer 🤣
Brad Pitt sucks at accents🤣
0:23-0:27 was so hilarious
I strongly believe that your accent is the sexiest ever, Jacksepticeye.  Somebody give this bonny wee lad a pint o’ beer, please.
im from ireland'
5 68 mins in is so funny😂
“Why can’t they just use Irish actors?” This is exactly how I feel when I see foreigners doing Jamaican accent in movies. I always laugh when someone tells me they learnt a Jamaican accent from the movie Cool Runnings. Those accents were terrible.😂There were no Jamaican actors in that movie and the movie was not even filmed in Jamaica. The movie was just a bad imitation of Jamaican people and culture.
He should have reviewed Campbell's irish accent from Peaky Blinders, holy shit he does it so good
Irish people are the most authentic in the English speaking world. Greetings from Tunisia 🍀❤️
Just Celtic accents  It’s really weird
The Irish accent literally sounds like they chugged 50 gallons of alcohol
The mad one with the sheep sounds like scots gaelic (or irish) backwards. Tom cruise's accent in far and away isn't great either
That woman 'teaching' how to do an Irish accent has never spoken to or heard an Irish person in her life, I was expecting her to do a "top o the morning" at any moment lol
I'm from Bray and I think the Southside accent should be the easiest for a foreigner to understand.
Just say these words quickly but enunciate them well: whale oil beef hooked. Congrats you now sound Irish.
I'm Belgian and I reckon I'd understand even the farmers, context clues are right there. I have been to Ireland 3 times to buy sheep so I might have an advantage. It's true what the pikey handsome George said; 'D'ya like dags?' truer words...
_“Mirror in Irish is like M-I followed by 15 'R's”_
10:08 Sean’s face when he learns she is American hahaha
8:06 what stands out about this guy isn’t his accent: it’s that he looks like a 35 year old Nickelodeon cartoon character that is described as a “schoolboy”
The only reason some Irish accents sound funny or incomprehencible is the fact we're speaking English, were we actually speaking our language it wouldn't seem so odd
He HAS to watch that scene in Bratz Fashion Piziez with the Irish gnome
start drinkin more milk BICH
That old man speaking straight up gibberish.
Adal o Hanon and Frank Kelly not the rally driver the other one them 2 are the best actors
the Irish farmers video was Gaelic wasn't it? /:
The guys just don't open their mouths. Full uh marbles are ye.
I wish my family never left the homeland. I belong in Ireland 😢. I'm just another American who is "Irish" but lost any and all culture associated by the 2nd generation. I'm the 3rd generation Irish American. We get. St patties day. 🎉
It’s Dani de nogla lol
Christopher Walkin doing an Irish accent sounds like an Irishman trying to sound like Christopher Walkin
Jack, what are the best counties to see for a first visit to Ireland?
Funny thing is I'm about 37.5% Irish and I don't got the accent AT ALL, I mean I roll my r's to make it sound 5% more irrish-ish to me
2:22 Is it just me or did Sean sound like Arnold Schwarzenegger here 😂
6:02 you heard THAT? 😆
This was SO MUCH FUN.  Could not get the sheep-loss-guy to save my life outside of the number and "mornin".  It's funny b/c after hearing an accent of almost any kind, it'll seep into my brain as I think things -- so my inner narrator ends up with an accent.  Unintentionally, m'mom asked me a question, and I ended up answering with a really trash Irish accent that was completely accidental.  I'm glad no one heard me.
This was so fun! Would you ever do another video but listening to other crazy accents from around the world? :) <3
(That man)your man
County
Your right about down conty kerry
love it!
Big unus annus doing accents vibe
when she goes...  flare im dead
my favorite jacksepticeye video
That farmers accent was a cross between Russian and Irish 😂😂
Irish accents are like snowflakes no one are the same but there all the same thing
so basically Irish accent is a drunken slurring
They are soo wrong on what we do in spare time we go to the pub btw im Irish but im 9 but thats what lots of people would say
Everytime I hear an Irish accent I want to punch a Brit. God bless em
As a Scottish person I am very, very confused why we were in the top 3 sexiest accents, I don't think we should crack the top ten. I am also confused as to why the Kiwi accent isn't even in the top 5
I could not understand anything the guy who lost his sheep said
I can never tell if I sound Irish or not
He pissed into a cup? The best Olympic rowers
true my dad is from Dublin and we make fun of his accent because we are from the country side
I naturally talk very quickly and have spent my entire life trying to consciously slow it down. My one visit to Ireland had me feeling like I had finally found my people. 😂
The Southern accent is kinda like this if u go to more into the deeper part of Georgia there are some very thick accents there
The first thing to have a good irish accent is the voice cracks
What County  is this guy from?.
lol
Please do more of these - I was looking forward to you getting up to the North! Your Cork is spot on, boy.
I love this guy . Why do so many Irish movies have English actor s in it.
Brad pitt does not play an Irishman in snatch its pikey completely different thing
5:01 sounds like Gaelic 🤣
Hmm yeah.. having a Irish character in a movie BUT the actor or actress isn’t IRISH!!!   It’s a similar concept when Sia made a movie about a autistic girl BUT DIDN’T CAST A AUTISTIC ACTOR!!! I heard that she did try to cast a autistic actor but the actor didn’t pass the audition test and kicked the person out of the acting. Which that’s not nice
och cold ye wouldn't be long gettin frosbit
Ireland isn't really any different on the "accent" front in that there are multiple accents within Ireland...just as basically everywhere else.  It's always funny to me when someone does an "American accent"...like, which one? There are numerous *states* with multiple accents within...let alone the entire country lumped together as one. Like...listening to some people from parts of Baltimore then listening to someone from Bethesda...you'd never guess they were from the same state. California has like 5 accents, Texas has like 4, and Florida has about 3...and I'm only talking major differences here, if you did all of the subtleties, there'd be at least 1000 accents in the U.S. . In some cases, you can hear serious accentual differences within the same city...one of my professors was from Queens in NYC, and my grandfather is from Brooklyn...very different sound there.
Is he even talking english? XD 4:51
im scottish and i found out that im irish and welsh aswell,, no english blood {how was with two years ago}
I'm French😭
Yorkshire accent is nothing on the Irish accent but as someone from West Yorkshire with a light-medium strength accent and I can make it stronger, sometimes I've come across older people with the strongest Yorkshire accents and I'm still trying to figure out what he said like 2 years later so the fact that Jack could translate everyone is crazy.
Brad Pitt's in snatch isn't bad it's a traveller accent specifically it's not spot on but it's decent
Aw that sheep one is kind of upsetting now, that's a lot of money for a farmer to lose.
When you and Brian do other Irish accents...!
Fake Irish Christopher Walken is the most amazing thing I didn't know I needed.  Brad Pitt did amazingly in his role in my opinion. They even explain in the movie how strange his character is because other Irish can't understand him. Probably a side effect of fighting literally all the time.
17:28 glad I am not the only one who thought that
I was born and raised in the Netherlands and we have a very strong accent ourselves, so i wouldn't dare try any other accent towards someone who actually knows what it sounds like, but my violin teacher was originally from Londonderry county. He had been living in Holland for about 13 years at that time, so he speaks Dutch perfectly, but especially his R and L sounded very typical.
The farmer wasnt that hard to understand I honestly dont know what yous are on about
The Cork rowers are my favourite 😂 they have the same accent as my godmother who is indeed from Cork 🥰
I worked at a veterinary for some time and they did pets as well as farm animals. No joke .. when farmers called, lord did I need to concentrate - they do be having the heaviest accents out there. And these where from villages around my own .. it’s crazy 😂
My dad is one of the few people I know who can pull off an Irish accent and isn’t Irish
watching this with auto captions was the REAL wild mountain thyme lol
frostbat
If I concentrate I can understand it 😂
the sheep one tho
A lot of people say that I sound American , Australian , Irish , German , Mexican and I think British 😭😭😭
It is dreadful
Im irish slash eire
I might be too ignorant about it but im coming from a place of love before i look this up, but isnt irish scottish?
Oh, I fucking love the Irish. Such a grand bunch of souls
Real Irish accents: 'would ya like a padaita lad?'
“GET FUCKED ITALY!” 😂😂
Most sexy?, hahhahahaaha, you my mean in the opinion of Europeans who speak English. Aka white people..no part of Asia,  the Caribbean,  Africa,  Middle think that. I know we live in a horrible world where everyone thinks they are the best. I however have no bias. There is no such thing as the best accent.  It is all based on preference.
U know whats funny i saw an irish personand a scottish cunt have an argument 😂😂
Seán should drop a Irish accent tutorial
West limrick takes the best from limrick and kerry accents
I can understand like -30-50%- 10-20% of the words, but the meaning is totally lost to me..
Christopher Walken trying to do an Irish accent just turns out to be a bad Arnold Schwarzenegger impression 🤔
"start drinking more milk bitch" meanwhile im sitting at my desk at 1am sipping on a cup of milk
yeah the irish accent of a woman drives me mad (in a good way)
Hi jack im from dorgheda
"I'm a vowel bender" 🤣🤣🤣 I'm in knots!
At 19:20 I couldn't even tell he paused the video
I get this with South African accents. No one can do them and everyone thinks they can.
Brad Pitt stayed with travellers in England to get that accent. It wasn't supposed to be Irish Irish.
Is the sheep one even english
as someone from iran i always were fascinated with Irish accent and Ireland and the fact i partly understood 80% of what that farmer said made my day
I'm actually happy, that I being a non native english speaker, understood almost most of it. Definitely  not the farmer tho
5:31 “possibly at night like it’d be a full moon there all night and sure it’d be bright out couldn’t anyone go up in the mountains at night sure.”   5:50 “Well there was 45 sheep missing like and the lambs and everything with the sheep it counts out to a nice bit of money like. What can be done about it. Nothing.”
6:43 “It’s not all that difficult all you got to do is have a good dog. Have a good dog and go at night, some moon shine night. Just put the dog around them, put them on a trailer or walk them.”   7:14 “Whoever is doing it knows what he is doing”
Lad u sound American
Wrong Jack Northern Irish accent rated sexier in world which I find hard to believe fss 😂😂
Bro what do they mean? A British accent is the hottest cmon guys
I remember when I lived in Ireland and worked for a woman to take care of her garden, one of my coworkers had come from cork and he had such a strong accent I could hardly understand what he said, I felt so bad that I asked him to repeat all the time! People who can understand strong accents are wizards
miur
kerry accents 💀
Bro what's crazy is I have the top 3 genes in me, my mom is Irish, my dad is Italian and Scottish
The Last Vowelbender starring Jack
Hearing that shepherd speak is like having to learn English again
COUNTY CORK IS MY FAVORITE OMGGG   I’m Irish but I grew up in Alaska😩I wanna go to Ireland so bad. I love my people so much. County Cork is my favorite accent so far 💙
I've drank, mishka, eristoff, Smirnoff, perestroika, stolichnaya, absolut, Eros, skyy, Geoff Moore of dalby, pleased to meet ya
the sheep farmer sounds like Irish Boomhauer
I was literally going to comment about that Hot Fuzz reference
To be fair, Brad Pitt was attempting a traveller accent not any regional Irish accent.
What even is an irish accent.
Mayo the best
I'm in the feckin movie laddy
With the olympics thing, the hardest part is just the odd expressions they keep using... I can pick out the words when they're just talking about specific things, but they always lead in when speaking with random expressions I'd never have heard before.
I am an aussie, with a English grandmother (mum's side) and Scottish grandfather (Dad's side), raised in West. Australia. Yeah... we sound like a different breed, I swear
As someone who doesn't speak English natively, just hearing those farmers speak is making all the English understanding I had melt out of me brain
I exploded when he said "eat shit france"
We just make foon of each other
Is this ENGLISH?
Did this bitch just say flare
As a Welsh person, our accents are nothing special, but we do have the unique ability to understand all Celtic associated accents quite easily, the only downside to this ability is I can't understand accents south of Northampton and east of Bath, and don't get me started on the posh accents, I speak 4 languages and I still can't understand a word they're saying.
Oyerlund
Im american but ive been told by some that i can do a good british accent and i can sort of do an Australian accent and indian
I physically cringed in slight minor pain upon hearing you say herb while pronouncing the h
Out of the Irish accents that I've heard, Becky Lynch's is the sexiest.
all i heard was "DICK SEAT."
I was dying laughing listening to that guide to Irish accents segment
as a kerry man it was surprisingly easy to understand
I think the Irish accent to Europeans is like the Up North Minnesotan accent to Americans.
I go back to this video like 3times a year, and in those 3 times, I watched it for like 5 times lol makes sense? 🤣
Note how he didn't say anything about Australia because he knows it would come right back at him. We don't play around🤣
Irish sounds like danish!
Somehow I was able to pick up the majority of what that sheep farmer had to say
The most wierdest irish accent: *NOGLA*
I really hate to be that guy but the answer to "why not just hire Irish people" is that its acting. That's like saying" why not just hire real farmers".. because its a movie dude..
Love the video, however correction: Brad Pitt in Snatch is a 'Pikey', they gave a long winded introduction of it. However, please recycle this video and roast ta'fuck outta the new 'Witcher: Blood Origin'... The Irish accents are soo terrible, I can't even get into the show.
Are we sure the guy at 5:30 isn’t just speaking Irish? tuigim biergon gaelge.
All i know about Ireland is Conor Mcgregor and Jacksepticeye
5:05 losing his sheep turned this poor guy into the sweedish chef
1:46 you seemed to love the airplane emote all those years ago in skate 3
I can understand most of these people. probably because I'm like half Irish 😂
I'm Irish
i would bet actual money that "MAC AN TSITHIGH" eventually became "MacKenzie" and that's that on how absolutely FUCKED irish spelling is.
That Irish Accent music is like someone took the accents and meshed them all together.
Jeff needs a sorten out
Guy tries to sound Irish sounds like he's either from Brooklyn or Boston can't really figure out which one
Frostbet is one of my favourite videos of all time.
I don’t have an accent, though my mother was from Longford Ireland. But I would never fake an accent that’s just ridiculous.
Cork accent sounds like CallmeKevin
I didn't realize I wasn't subscribed after years of watching and rewatching your content. Ive seen this one SEVERAL times. IM A SUB NOW!!!! WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
i kinda wonder how the guy lost all those sheep tho
JACK! My Dad + Grandma are from county Mayo. Grandma's been in England some 50 years and she is convinced anyone from Ireland thinks she sounds English . I'm going to play her the good fellow who lost his sheep and see if she can understand it.
As an average Derry Girls enjoyer, I can proudly say that I did not have 0 fucking clue as to what was happening.
10:43 as a dublin man I can confirm no its just I maybe somewhere down derry or somewhere where theres bogs and sheep possibly then lmao
What county is Jack from?
Oooooh ye went be long getting  frostbit
I won’t lie- I was ecstatic beyond justification when I translated one sentence that farmer said
are you Irish like me
I've gotta say, even if the blonde girl was fraudulent, she was some truly lovely Kerrygold to me. Absolutely stunning, gorgeous freckles. Maybe she was one of the Others just having a laugh at our expense.
watching this is what i imagine its like for ppl outside the south to listen to deep southern accents, or like deep midwest boomhauer types
im way late to this one. so many laughs.
Those sheep the farmer had were Rough Fell It's a Common sheep in Ireland I think I'm not from Ireland but I do raise sheep and it's very handy to know the different sheep breeds.
A really awful Irish accent is Norman Reedus in Boondock Saints (1999)
Imagine a world where Jack isn’t Irish…. That’s crazy bro
I think he’s just missing a few teeth
I'm a vowel bender 😆😆😆😆😆😆
I always imagen irish like a small goblin with golden coin and a bucket
I’m actually irish and I’m patrick
"How to do an Irish accent." Also, "how to cook a food."
What the fuck is a european accent ?
I have a Bit of experience with Brogue, but I was only able to understand a few words here or there from the farmer. My Great Grandmother spoke with about a 25% lighter of an Accent than him, but I still can't seem to hear the part about moon.
My IELTS passing score didn't prepare me for this
ireland seems like a peaceful place. few missing sheep and old men speaking in tongues here and there but you win some you lose some
Newfoundlanders sound similar.
Why don’t you Irish ☘️ speak Irish? Why are you guys ashamed of your language? Help me to understand why you all rather sound like a leprechaun rather than speaking actually Irish?
Ok with the sheep guy I thought he was fucking speaking Gaelic
you should make a series of videos traveling trough ireland, i twould be really cool
i love it when seans accent gets stronger, i really enjoy seing his videos even more when that happens, not because i find the accent funny, i just really like that accent and like it when you are connected with your rooths, i think it's a good thing
This video was made 2 years ago today. Happy birthday
Brad Pitt was playing an Irish Traveller. Irish Travellers have their own distinct accent, and he was VERY accurate.
I always think the Irish accent is just a Scottish but very high pitch, but now I am learning Irish accent is when English says “Fuck it I am done”
How to have a perfect Irish accent:  Step one: be Irish Step two: live in Ireland Step tree: drink Guinness according to funny yt shorts
S'pose yur one's a plastic paddy?
I did knock a good laugh out of this.
I think Galway city has best accent in Ireland I don't like Northern Ireland accent In my opinion is worsted
I am Irish.
The two brothers I could almost fully understand... the farmers on the other hand...
And I thought a heavy southern US accent was bad
Surprisingly, I turned on captions and it actually understood the farmer's accent.  0:21 Think again,  Scotland's at 86% Ireland's at 77% The world is doomed.
I swear not all of our accents are this bizarre😂
'Snatch' has what I call 'Watery Irish'. It swirls in and out of the accent...
I have kildare accent
Well, you heard it here first,folks Jack is officially the sexist sounding person
It is the hottest accent though. Irish accents are my favourite. ☺
I'm from Cork myself but even i cant understand the waterford and kerry accents. They are truly a different breed
All I heard was "35 sheep missing" "down on the Moon"
my mother came into my room when I watch this I change to porn, Its easier to explain
11:49 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I'm irish
“Get Fooked Italy!” Lmao
The sheep video is a classic, but my favourite clip of Ireland was “don’t make unnecessary journeys”
Howdy from Carlow
The “what da phuck Jeff” reaction got me 😂😂
Lovely!
Farmer sounds like my great uncle lol
I’m Irish and I can’t even under stand the farmer that lost the sheep
Tbh Sean’s accent is extremely hot tbh
Listening to Brad Pitt I'm just sat here like WAT?
i ken may maw making a pie
mate i need to be on the phones in the morniing
"Your'e lucky your'e gorgeous". LOL...he did a Jamaican accent well...and now this. Farty-five sheep. A Dar-g around 'em. Frost bot...I have to do a version for BEV.
me being Irish without an irish accent: 😭
As a american. but is Irish,scottish, and Dutch. I could understand all of Irish accent
Am I the only one that had no issues understanding yer man,  the farmer
as a croat im proud to be irish
Do British and Irish people have the same accent? Or are they very much different?
i put subtitles on and it said "frosh but"
I think urwan was tryna get at the dublin accent, then had a mix of the North
Part 2???
I honestly would've guessed some heavier accents were speaking a Germanic or Scandinavian language.  It's like something about it sounds English but it ain't English.    At least I thought they weren't trying for English.
i have a communication disorder and this is something i dont understand
2:22 help why does he sound like gru
Ah the Irish David Platt
Diddlydee ptaters
Guy: *walks in winter without a jacket*  Jack: Irish people are jut built differently aren't they me: Minnesotans do this. Especially when there's only 2 inches of snow. also me: so the only people crazy enough to settle in Northern Minnesota were Irish? That checks out.
i   refuse to  believe that  farmer  is speaking e nglish
appeareantly donegal is 2 counties now and county letrim doesnt even exist
Is it bad that I understood every word of the mad Irish farmers interview. May I just add, I live in Australia, and the closest thing I am to Irish is my pale complexion and red hair
What shade is that eye makeup?
This was my favourite video of the year
What did he just say
There is not a word in the world more gender neutral with absalutely no gender assosiated with it then the Irish word "lads"
_Don’t let some legit Irish people force to watch some of that film, or else they might get mad_
I've met Rúidrigh  He's sharp as knives   Belter
Hey Sean. Where's me jumper you little Shit
It's like Jamaican accents. Hollywood casts like there are NO Jamaicans in the world 😆
I'm American and I understood the angry farmer... but I am from Kentucky and some people in the crevices around here talk like that.
That Walken impression at 2:21 is spot on.
OH BOY!!!! NEVER LAUGH SO MUCH IN MY LIFE WITH ONE VIDEO 😂😂😂 I'm crying 😂 i don't know you or the kind of content of your channel, but you have my sub and like just for making me laugh so hard today 😂.
Snatch is one of my all time favourite films and I could quote the entire thing off by heart thanks to watch it so many times with my dad; but it’s intentionally not meant to be genuine Irish because as the film says, ‘It’s not exactly English, it’s not exactly Irish; it’s just. Pikey.’ I love it lol.
to be fair, brad was trying to do a traveller accent in particular
I’m glad I’m not the only one who can JUST NEARLY understand them.
Im glad i have Irish accent
for some reason i have no trouble understanding cork accent.. im danish lul
I could understand everyone perfectly well (except the farmer of course, poor guy, I hope his sheep stop disappearing). I’m from southern US and have no exposure to Irish accents other than Sean and like, a few actors. But I understood every word all of these people said. Especially the rowers, they were crystal clear to me. Idk why
Or pikey In the movie
Is he Irish in snatched I thought he was Gypsie witch I have no idea about are they all Irish
Brad Pit is speaking more Newfie
I'm now starting to understand why Americans used to be racist against the Irish lmfao,
Do you have an irish accent, Or do you speak the irish as a language?lol.  Also Seán you should do one of your old Intro's and then Outro's
As Jason Stathom's character "Turkish" explains through narration prior to the first scene with Brad Pitt in Snatch, "Now there was a problem with Pikeys or gypsies; you can't really understand much of what's being said. It's not Irish, it's not English. It's just, well.. it's just Pikey."
Sean does a better Christopher walken impersonation than Christopher walken does an irish accent.
im from skibbereen in west cork (where the irish rowers are from) and understood them perfectly,  the west cork accent is so thick that even other irish people don’t understand it lmao
I'm a Newoundlander. You can't discount  our accent.
I absolutely luv this... Your accent is the greatest.
You have to blame Derry Girls for some misconceptions about the common Irish accent.
It looks like a couple of dwarves from Lord of the Rings come alive
Oh my lord I need you to react to Disney’s The Luck of the Irish, please for the love of God!
Whoever find a Scottish accent attractive needs help
No one will ever understand pickeys
you dont have a sexy accent you need to put on a dublin accent,i hate irish actors that put on american accent,theres an american actress that does an irish accent when the movie has nothing to  with ireland ,as for your accent you shout you should have a smooth silky voice like the rest of us
As a Ukrainian this makes no sense to me
Ireland is built different
I watch ur videos and I’m American!
I feel so dirty and ashamed that I laughed 🤣🤣🤣
What dialect is Jack?
I learn my Irish accent from this man, Sean McLaughlin
I understand that sheep farmer perfectly
A real thick irish accent is a thing of beauty and mystery 😜😂🤣 like Mr. O'shea 🤯 wow lol drunks are easier to understand
Farty Five sheep. That's a lot of sheep....and farts.
I have a bad habit where I watch a video of someone speaking with an accent and then I start speaking in said accent without even meaning to lol. So I would most likely pick up ab accent if I move to Ireland which I want to move there when I’m older
I have a feeling that Irish is an accent that you understand the more drunk you become
Then up here in Belfast it’s just YEEEOOOOO
LOL
They would have a better chance interviewing the sheep-
Is it weird I understood most of this?
me after about 5 years of watching jacksepticeye: *not even subscribed yet*
brad pitts accent is good if you consider that hes a gypsy
The farmer sounded like he was speaking a different language wtf
Jack, do you happen to know who Foil, Arms and Hog are? Irish comedians, I frigging love them. I recommend you a video of them named Regional Accent Discrimination.
I love putting on the subtitles for thick accents. Not just because I can’t understand them but I love when the subtitles go off the rails and changes words and makes it sound ridiculous. Perhaps I’m easily amused…Fir instance. That young guy said ‘frosh butt’ according to the subtitles.
I'm Irish and this video is so freakin hilarious and I miss Ireland too,I currently live in the US
Sean I love your Christopher Walken impression,so freakin awesome
Your Christopher Walken impression was spot on.
I just realized I’ve been saying frostbite like frost-bit ever since I watched this video and his video was left ingrained into my mind. I literally NEVER realized I was saying frost-bit (in my head, hadn’t said it out loud yet) this entire time until today
Regardless; fantastic video brother. I'm in Dublin now on Merrian Road and it was great to hear that I'm not insane.
Dude; I'm a licensed forensic phycologist with a master's degree in Education to teach English reading and composition, have spent years in Ireland and Scotland (because they are awesome), but that sheep farmer's accent is 98% unintelligible to me. I heard "mountain" I think haha.
I’m a year late but no. he’s half Irish half English thrown into a bumpkin blah. he’s a piky
I could pick up a couple of words from the farmer guy (I’m British btw) but most of it made no sense
Sounds Irish to me
6:45 huffungoojagin. Fortniesungk
Jack, be honest with yourself…Even yourself doesn’t know what 50% of him is saying
you should try understand Doric  some of our accents are even worse than these Irish ones
Dia dhuit
Sean needs to watch foil arms and hog, for a video.
cool
Your accent was the best, obviously. But please, shave more off the ugly moustache and the beard and leave just a hint of it, if you must. It looks disorderly, untidy. Sorry.
I have a welsh accent and even I cant understand this
my last name is mayo, fucking mayo about as irish as it gets
i’ve got a little irish boy last name
Bruh I’m 20% Irish… I can’t even attempt an accent… whenever I try I think of your voice and try to play off of it
I understood more than half of what the Irish shepherd said and I'm not even a native english speaker (I'm hungarian). **visibly proud of himself**
As an Irish person I find this hilarious how bad it this is.
Turned on captions and my youtube froze
Farty five sheep
Jack: *listening to bad accents*  Jack: *cussing his ass off*
F A R T Y   F I V E
The interesting thing is when an Irish accent pops up when you least expect it. Like Liam Neeson in Ponyo.
Late to the game but this video was the best thing ever. I literally got abs from laughing at this. 💜
HA, CAD FAOI GHRÉIR-ghaeilge!                                  (Used in Google translate, I don't speak Irish, but I doo have aan Irish acceent, and somehoow I can do a Irish accent, in FEECKING TEXT!
Are you kidding me? there are many more languages that are much more attractive than Irish. Don't get me wrong Irish is a fun language and it's very cultural and even iconic in some ways but not sexy.
Sean have you ever been in vew liffey Valley
I translated that to my coworkers andcI'm an American with Irish, Dutch, German, Polish, French-Canadian, and Norwegian ancestry...      Obviously after watching this....
I wonder if you're able to speak Irish??
I understood the rowers handsome of the farmer, it's not that hard really. And I'm Australian - part English too
I swear to fuck our wee Ulster accent is slandered I’m gonna lose my shite That boy at the end has a shite northern Irish accent
I have a Scottish accent and it was hard to tell
I'm from scotland and HOW DARE YOU SAY THAT TO OUR COUNTRY GRRRRR
My great grandfather was from county Kerry and my dad told me people couldn't understand him when he came over to Canada and then the US bc of his "brogue" and only hearing lighter Irish accents as a kid I never understood how... Then I saw that news video and it all made sense
8:12 that's a hearty Donegal accent right there!
Haha eat shit France had me laughing
The irish accent debate always just reminds me of Taliesin Jaffe trying to make his character have an irish accent, failing, and then Matt Mercer just took it and ran. Chances are that Matt's accent is still not perfect, but man, it's sexy.
Definitely different throughout Ireland, was at Irish college a while ago, and I’m the type of person to imitate accents subconsciously. Around some people they thought I was from Kerry. I’m from Dublin for the record
Im northern irish and even i understood these better than jack lmao
That farmer sounded like he was speaking welsh
7:36 portugal is the same xD they put so many news about dumb people and somethings that dont even make sense its funny, one time they talked about a man that saved a sheep during a fire, they talked about it for an hour straight xddd gandas tugas
Seáns accent sounds very similar to what I’d here around where I live in Tipperary (by the way if ye come to Ireland don’t ask us to say top of the morning to ya, we don’t say that 🤣)
I would love to see you review Moone Boy
Which accent though? Ah who am I kidding they’re all sexy.
Wait….his name is Seán!?? I thought his name was Jack this whole time 😅 Donegal has the best!!
We're planning on visiting Europe next summer and I'm tempted to ask my folks to drop me off in Ireland for a few months and see if I can pick up the accents. All I have to go off of are a few shows on the BBC network but that's about it.
It says a lot that as a Welsh speaker, the farmer's accent sounded more like Welsh to my ear than English
I'm in the US 11 years, lost me accent quite a bit but now and again I will get it back, listening to you, I got a bit of it back. This shiz is hilarious, love love love the farmer. It's nice to hear accents but FFS, those fake ones... and I agree with you.. Why couldn't they hire an Irish lady for Emily Blunt's character... And Christopher Walkin... I like him an an actor but I will not watch that film now... Scarlet.
Wow these put my friends "accents" of me to shame
Jack did a better Christopher Walken impression than Christopher Walken did an Irish accent bahaha
It's like hearing an Irish version of boomhauer
the sean news anchor sounds just like jack. they even have the same name. Sean M.
This is how I feel about people trying to do a Minnesota accent on tv shows 😂😂😂 WE DONT SOUND LIKE THAT
I always try to do an Irish accent with some of my friends that are actually Irish but it always and I mean ALWAYS sounds like I’m special ed xD
Am Yorkshire, and suprisingly, and impressively I understood a lot of what that farmer and that school lad had to say 😂
Seán Mac an tSithigh... Sean.. Mac an theegh... Sean Mac n teegh... Teeth... Sean... Sean Mac n cheese.. Mac n teeth. Cheese teeth. Sean has Mac n cheese teeth.
Wait, wait… You’re telling me AUSTRALIAN was voted one of the “most sexiest” accents in the world? Australian…? Really?
seans accent sounds exaugurated
I think sexiest accent is monaghans
BRO, I THINK ME TAKING IEP AS A KID FUCKED MY IRIRSH ACCENT
The farmer who lost sheep sounds like he's speaking a mix of English and Vietnamese. Like, spoken simultaneously. Or like English spoken with the tonality of Vietnamese, and Vietnamese has a LOT of tone marks/diacritics. --Sincerely, a half-white, half-Vietnamese person
Frostbit
Brad Pitt played an English Pikie/gypsy mate, not an Irishman. Brad was brilliant in snatch. The Kerry sheep farmer kills me every time.
Tree trees fell on a tree tree times.
😂 if people end up talking about Yorkshire accents.. doing em badly.. I get the cringe 😂 After game of thrones I got even more people attempting that 'northern accent'
Watching this makes me feel disappointed in the American school system cause we didn’t learn any of this shit😱
Here I am, having been looking for an Irish accent because I have a homework assignment to record my voice for an Ireland tour commercial. Jack Septiceye was not the correct channel to build my confidence in my ability to do an Irish accent.  For reference, I'm from Texas. Wish me luck!
11:27 Tutor: "Park" Father Jack: "Feck!" Tutor: "Garden" Father Jack: "Fecking garden!"
Surprisingly, I understand most of the words, and it is very strange for me to hear an Irish accent.
I'm from Cork and practically everyone speaks like that well depends on what part
go to Newfoundland, there are several Irish dialects there lol
13:06 yeah, that's me talking about anything relating to finland and suddenly my otherwise oh so nonexistant nordic european accent is all too present-
So is nogla in this
Being a Scottish person myself I understand the pain of being from somewhere that people would have a hard time understanding what you say even though it's the same language
7:00 Irish Albert Einstein
Not Irish nor English, but I do catch some words!
It’s so similar to the heavy Newfoundlander accent. You should watch videos from there.
Love to see if he can understand a Newfoundlander.... very similar accent to irish
I’d say that it’s more like a big fish in a small pond
I’m from Northern Ireland and can’t understand that farmer
This whole time I thought he was Scottish.
I thought the Aussie scent was fuck must have been wrong
How did I understand everything and I'm Australian
Man I hate it when people try to learn words from my language before we meet... Like, just ask me for the word, why do you think butchering some words will have an impact on our first meeting? The language doesn't have many tutorials so ask me cause you sure won't get a better source than a Slovenian
flars are pretty
If I was to say someone was doing a "general Irish accent" or if I was trying to do one for a language study, I'd probably try to emulate the accent of someone who grew up in the big cities, kinda similar to how London has its own accent apart from the rest of England  Edit: that being said, if I was an actor playing an Irish character, I'd want to know where my character is from to try to get the accent accurate to that region/town. If I was playing someone who's English but they're from somewhere up North, a London accent would not make sense for them
I cannot believe that Sean actually translated that farmers sentence
Mikey Joe O'Shea, the man, the myth, the legend!! But in all fairness I understood nothing he said
I only understand irish after about 2-3 pints 😅
irish CNN
I am Irish and this is just killing me  🤣
Farmer just sounded danish to me
I really want to know what an European accent sounds like, I mean is it like all languages mixed together?
I like how everyone else has to try and decipher what's being said and I'm able to understand it all hahaha
I'm from cork and and couldn't even understand the sheep fella
The rubberbandits!!
"Music, you call it. Muuusic."
why is it all uppercase then you get to the t
Frostbutt
I’m from Limerick and I have to say Mikey Joe is acting the dope
Yo sean do you speak irish? Like gaeilge?
every time I hear Cork my head turns 90 degrees I think I've been watching too much CallMeKevin
I'm Brazilian, and for me Irish sounds badass as hell! Is a crosspath between a drunk Scottish pirate and a Texas native 😆
As an Irish lad myself I can somehow understand him probably because I live in Kerry.
But I could understand it
That was a heavy ascent
Love you Jack
I like the way Irish people say "butter"
I want to wear a "kiss me, I'm American" shirt for next independence day
I understand just fine. Your accent is not thick enough to misunderstand. I can understand you better than many native USA English speakers
As an Irish person living in England I really want to improve my understanding of all Irish accents not just Cork and Dublin.
I think Tom cruises accent is alright actually. Maybe I'm just biased cos I love Tom cruise but he's actually doing grand for an American lad
Don't let Americans teach Irish. Stick to English
2:22 goodness he sounds like Gru
The woman you were saying was British and not Ireland is probably just from one of the places in Ireland where I think it was like every Irish woman must have at least one child for a British man say back when Britain took over Ireland
Irish person here. I too understand them. My grandpa sounds like the farmer.
2:24 xD 11:33 even an Irishman is happy when he is doing the irish accent correctly xD
Wait.. so if you live in Dublin, Ireland... Does that mean the speed that you speak at is Dublin'???
"Ya don't sound or look Irish!"
"Your one" is most used in my family.. I hate it. 😐
I really hope sean gets a chance to hang out with a bunch of Irish mates, I would absolutely love to see a video of that!
That article in the beginning calling Irish the sexiest accent in the world is written by "IrishAroundTheWorld" lmao
But I’m lactose intolerant……
Aren't there like... 50 different Irish accents?
I'm irish to so it makes Jack's videos 10 times better
11:50 Is she the language equivalent of that lady that was a “Freestyle dance teacher”
I, asexual but for some reason I got excited when I saw Scottish was 3rd on the list I was like omg no way my accent is so high! 😭😂 Funny thing is no one can do it, & Scottish actors being forced to exaggerate their accents *cough Cho Chang* doesn’t help 😭😂
This is how it feels when people try to do Australian accents! You sound rubbish, just cast an Aussie lol
Jacksepticeye is teaching me how to fake an Irish accent.
Disney Brave is a Irish princess who likes archery who disobey her mother and she cast her mother a spell and she’s trying to fix her mistakes have you seen Brave
I want to learn a Irish accent now
Oyrlind is apparently how you say it in an Irish accents
Sure and bejaysus now, dere's more to Oirland dan dis. 😄
French men sound like homasexerals.  Pitt was speakin Pikey.  Who's to say it wasn't brilliant?
It's all fun and games until you get to the Aran Islands can't you can't understand the waiter.
seems like the southern parts of different places in the world are always the ones that carry the heavy accents, but also, i didn't do well in geography so correct me if i'm wrong. it's just what i've observed is all
Ok so imagine if Ozzy Osbourne were Irish.
The farmer sounds like he's speaking icelandic
I actually really like the farmers accent, I can understand him just fine and when you can you can hear his accent and  it’s actually pretty nice.
when most directors who arent irish try to make irish movies, it just doesnt work 💀
never heard an irish accent in real life
Sean has the best Irish accent and I could seriously listen to him speak all day. I have a few Irish speaking pts and I so love their accents. I am 25% Irish, but definitely just a Jersey girl lol
6:47 fortnite
6:02 "Alright, alright - I'll translate for you."  *proceeds to take what sounds like a completely different language and translate it to English* (I know the guy's speaking English, but my uncultured brain can't piece it together. Please don't spam me, lol)
nothing will ever beat paddy heffernan isn’t that right jack
Omg that’s the exact video I watched to try and learn🤣🤣 jack show me the correct path🤣🤣
i also say mirrrrrrrrrrrrrrr sean
I’m surprised at how much of the heavy accents I was able to understand.  You should rate hard to understand accents of the world.  Heavy Cajun accents get pretty hard to sort out.
14:24 and you also like the ten months of rain and the drunk men walking around screaming like a husky and also let me guess the Colledge if you somehow see this you got to pin it if I’m right ok, alright here it is           UL
As a Minnesotan, I feel your pain and find this hilarious
This and the type of southern accent Boomhauer has are just as goofy
Jeff’s of the guy is not the only Irish person
I've lived in Ireland my whole life I haven't a clue what anyone's saying
i am so incredibly high right now i cant do that farmers one
Pikey brad Pitt is best brad Pitt
the vocal teacher lady is unninclusive, my irish teacher doesn't say "oiland," he says "Arland"
Oes rhywun yn deall be dwi'n ddweud mae pob person dwi wedi siarad yn dweud mod i'n swnio'n Gernyweg mae hynny'n hollol shite.
The way a Derry man says mirror is >>>>>>
Lmao the subtitles with the strong accent guy
I'm a Scottish doric speaker and I could barely understand the farmer. I thought our accents got heavy but the farmer is on another level.
As a southern American I couldn’t understand anything that farmer was saying. Legit just sounded like gibberish
Cork accent is the easiest to understand to actually...
Sèan’s reaction to “flewuer” was great
the worst is the dublin common accent... you can tell by my name 'IM BLEEDIN BAIT THE FUCK OUTTA YA, YIZ ARE SHITEBAGS'
I need to learn cork accent
I KNOW WHAT HE SAID!!.... BAGIBITYBAHHGIBITY-that psycho from rug rats!
i always thought it was interesting that Sean _barely_ has an accent - and i'm saying this from an American perspective.  like - he sounds vaguely sort of GenAm and i only hear a _little_ Irish and absolutely no English.  i often wonder how he got such an accent.
FUCK YEAH WE ARE SEXIER THAN OUR ENGLISH ANCESTORS
"GET FUCKED FRANCE" I fucking died after that hahahah
My aunt be like: gevmesjsacuvatesa Me: what? Give me a cup of tea
I canne do a Irish accent. I can kinda do a Scotty one
oy..blyat
personally I really enjoy Saoirse Ronan's accent and all her work as well, but I enjoy yours as well. I like to do an Irish accent at times being neurodivergent of sorts I do accents all the time sometimes completely unaware of it at first. There's some I can do really well and some not so much. Doing an Irish accent is decent lol I really want to go to Ireland and travel around and meet people. I'm part Irish so its close to my heart
From Kildare and live in Dublin and can confirm that a strong South kerry accent is 50/50 in terms of understanding.
USA: Gotta travel across state lines to hear a different accent.  Ireland and the UK: You can hear like 10 different accents just walking your dog down the road.
Jesus Christ, I have partial hearing loss (20% total hearing or so in the left, ironically 100% in the right) and this is a fucking nightmare scenario trying to understand that farmer.
How many of you know that his name is actually Sean. Like is it an agreed thing that we dont call him his name? Cuz i just got here and NOBODY is calling him by his real name its all jack jack jack jack lol
okay some words sound like a canadian accent xDDD
Love the Irish accent. The only time I've noticed that you can't understand it is when, as in this video and even watching Jack talk, is that they aren't opening their mouth and they don't enunciate. It'd be hard to understand anyone who keeps their mouth closed to the point they are almost mumbling when they talk.
surprised japanese accents werent the sexiest
*Irish accents are both beautiful and also confusing*
I love the way there is a skill gap in this accent  honestly even up north here our farmer's accents aren't that bad even in Tyronne
Ngl This vid makes me proud to be Irish
I understood most of the accents.  Although not from Ireland I am from Newfoundland Canada and many of us sound very Irish.  That first guy speaking about the sheep did not understand him.
i am irish i can barely understand that accent lol
As an Irish person, I can say confidently that that man was talking halo elite.
5:30 Possibly at 8? A beautiful mornin' around (Guessing a city name here) should be bright out; okay then im like ok ill go out in the mountains an' im like okay sure!"
After being with my Irish bf for 3yrs now and being around his family and Gaelic football teammates with strong cork ascents, I was actually able to understand the cork accents pretty well.
ok but what happened to the sheep?
I’m Native French and I don’t agree with the chart. I should be lower
🤣" start drinking more milk bitchh "
There's no gays in Ireland Kathleen!
I don’t think it’s bad it’s just hard to understand even for me
I can show you I’m Irish in one word: Barry’s tea
"The internet is full of people who don't have Irish accents trying to do one & it sounds awful"   Somewhere, Talisen Jaffe is mumbling into his hands "I know, alright. I finally was happy with it & then _he died_ - so I went with a Midwestern cow-dad"
I want him to react to the last monoglut irish speaker
I kinda felt lime I was watching sins talk in da farmer 1
//
The part where he said “try saying mirror” then says “it’s M-I- and 15 R’s” I was crying I was laughing so hard
Me; Trying to figure out what the heck the farmer just said Jack: *Laughing in understanding words*
whe jack said irish rowers i thought he said irish rovers.
This is how i feel about people who arent from the Southern United states playing someone from the southern united states.
I'm a vowelbender xDDDDD
Norman Reedus and Sean Patrick Flannery's Irish accents in The Boondock Saints aren't that great either. Great fucking movie tho
Are you sure he's not just speaking Gaelic?
This video:nobody understands people in          Kerry People in Kerry:🥲
"Drink more milk bitch" - Jacksepticeye 2020 love this lmao
this was my most favourite video of yours XD
His feet feel jelly? That's defeat.
The drawing of the man wearing the spar bag is Blindboy, from The Rubberbandits, who is from Limerick. He has a podcast with his very soothing voice & accent.
People always eyeing me for my Northern Language accent and when i speak "plattdeutsch" i even get eyed more cuz not all germans understand that haha
best video ever :D
Scottish is so much worse
Sad to see the death of Irish and greater Celtic culture by the British
No wonder I get turned on when I look at red headed chicks 😂😂
I understand some of what the heavy Irish accents are but I am northern Irish
oh hearing those cork accents was so good! reminds me of my mum when shes on the phone to her sisters and ALLLL the accent comes right back
I'm almost positive the Limerick fella is a reference to the Rubberbandits XD
god, im irish as well and i can confirm that i could not understand that rté broadcast about the sheep
Is it bad that even though I am American, I can understand everything that is said here
As a Kerry native, I had no trouble understanding poor auld Mikey Joe.  My dad sounds a bit like him, to be fair.
I'm so sorry but the farmer Irish guy sounds like a Sim trying to chew on a flute and I couldn't get one word but it sounded adorable
People from Ireland can agree that the Donegal accents are the strongest Irish accents ever
I had an irish accent when I was young (I've been in Ireland all my life) but when I got older my accent slowly changed to american, and I really miss my old accent
I'm an Australian, and can understand every word of these guys. I don't think our accent is similar at all, but we also have a bunch of blokes from out bush who are barely intelligible, so I guess I'm used to it.
OMFG the captions were doing gods work
I need another one of these videos. Jack please
Conas ata tu
Would have appreciated some subtitles on those clips! For me- it's the cadence that throws me off and makes some of the speakers sound like they're not speaking English. Strange pauses and also ums and other filler sounds 😂 This is so fun 😂
Northern Ireland has some pretty wild accents too. I grew up in Limavady and when I moved to the states with my family I had to take speech therapy for 2 years because no one could understand crap I said.
Here from cork and laughing my head off
the super thick irish accent just sounds like swedish
Oddly enough I'm an American from California and I could pretty much understand most of the accents with the exception of the sheep herder. I mean I would miss a word or two but I certainly understood the accents enough to get the gist of what they were saying. However with the sheep herder I could only understand about six words he said lol.
Now i want to watch Mrs. Brown’s Boys. 😂😂
Nobody: A man in 1940: 0:27
Good God, the Irish farmers are killing be, I can’t understand a fucking word. Weirdly enough it makes me think of the Appalachian dialect. That I can understand though.
What county is Jack from
10:10 😂😂😂😂 you pull exactly the same face that my husband makes when he hears a QUESTIONABLE "irish" accent.
To be fair… Brad Pitt was “Pikey” not Irish… he stole that whole movie, too😎
🤣🤣🤣 the kid said "frostbutt" 🤣🤣🤣
My man, you HAVE to watch "Regional Accent Discrimination" by Foil Arms and Hog
A friend of my parents went to Ireland and asked directions from someone in The Middle of Nowhere, Co. Roscommon. They couldn't understand the Irish guy and the Irish guy just finally goes "Well, what language do you speak, because I'm speaking English!" And my dad's friend decides to be a smartaleck and says "well, my first language is Spanish." And this dude with the thickest Roscommon accent tries to give him directions in Spanish.
I think the wan doing how to do the accent is a north Dublin accent sean
My dad is from Newtownards, can you do an NI accents video?😂
3:39 those lines sound like a high sean from rdr 2
Brad Pitt😂
I could understand every word all of these said , but I’m Mancunian and some of our accents are a mystery to me
Does he speak Gaelic too, or just English? Idk much about Ireland other than that Gaelic is their official language alongside English, but idk what percentage of the population speaks it.
can proudly say that i have sat on frostbit boy's lap
You had tell Ireland lots many people's often more visit Wales Cardiff Newport Swansea Bridgend sarn aberkenfig pothcawl maesteg Neath date Tuesday 31 may 2022 time 9:00am trill forever present good place to stay safe Wales and Irish people pub powerful forever present.

Pov you turned on subtitles
I love in Ireland and they really don't sound Irish my  teacher was from Kerry look up the accent I was in his class from 4th to 5th
just me or are irish mammys always talking about death?
You should do another accent review and include the various Irishman from Frontier
Even Ireland has their own strong southern accents. Looks like America is not alone in this
"Over *farty* five sheeps were stolen" 🤣
19:10 I think Jack might be from this place based on the accent cause it sounded so much like him.
When that farmer who lost his sheep started talking, it immediately reminded me of Hot Fuzz. IIRC David Bradley was using a West Country accent or something in that movie. 😂
Man the fucking accents are fucking to funny
Farty five sheep have been stoulen
Sean has a much better Walken impression than Walken does Irish haha
IM AN IRISH KID WHO LOVES SONIC
"Music u call it?....Music?"
Hello jack
Outch
I’m Irish and I can’t even understand the farmer from Kerry  Edit: I can kind of but it’s difficult
I literally didn't understand a word from that Irish sheep farmer.
When newzealand got worlds sexiest accent that title lost all meaning and credibility.   Change my mind:
Bokkit!!!
The farmers accent is actually really comforting to listen to.
11:19 Jack because people always ask me to speak in an Irish accent that it actually fucked with some of the words I say normally and has bits of Irish in them so this whole mirror thing is.....yeah......but now try that with the word horror you’re ganna offend a lot of with that one
Certified great bunch o' lads
Can you explain why American's can't tell someone imitating us?
xD
0:42  can't I'm lactose intolerant
HE SOUNDED LIKE GRU!!!2:21
Gotta love those Oirish accents.
I could actually kinda understand the farmer XD
This needs to be in a try not to laugh jack would loose instantly
irish women are gorgeous
My dad's so Western that when we were watching interviews and the man was a Dubliner - my dad thought it was a US accent LOL
I really enjoyed this. Thank you.
The Brad Pitt one is the only one I couldn't understand😂
You like dags? will be always be my favourite line from Snatch😂
The farmer's accent sounds like Dutch to me loll
ur WAAAY better when you pretend to be Irish!
My great grand mother was from Ireland. Dear god she had an accent, she was from Kerry. I couldn’t understand her most of the time, my mom would have to translate. They really have thick accents
There's sahm Scottish peepul that kinna say "Purple Burdlram"
Bro i was letting the video load while was talking in discord and i heard was "THE IRISH ACCENT" i jumped so hard
When I talk to people they say they can hear my Irish in my voice even tho I’m Scottish
Another fantastic episode of can't understand shite with jacksepticeye. Never can understand you, but man your accent makes me laugh
I honestly thought he was speaking Gaelic for a split second.
Jokes on you I love milk
was that farmer speaking some Gaelic mixed with the english or something??
Kinda proud bc I was actually able to understand a lot of what those Olympians were saying. Maybe it's just because I grew up in a very Irish-populated area
Nogla can sometimes come across with a thicken accent... or he's just being thick. 😆
Northern Irish is better sounding.  The Republic of Guinness doesn’t own the Irish accent you know!
I want to learn Irish I’m Australian we’re boring!! 🍀
There’s a video titled “the STRONGEST Irish accent you’ll ever hear!” and it is amazing you need to see it
The fact that my home country is ranked third sexiest accent is awesome
Either you did the captions or AI has no trouble understanding any of it. Almost perfect captions. Scary. AI is listening to everything….
The first does not sound irish it sounds scottish some sound scottish
Newfie people are just as bad in all honesty
I'm irish
7:47 that is how I remember Undertale videos sounding. That was my first experience with your channel.
irish accents are so cool to listen to, its like cool music
this clip was really funny and fun
> Conveniently ends before it talks about Northern Ireland  Very wise decision Sean. The comment section is relatively free of political arguments…
Putting your woman in there with the British accent in a video showcasing _Irish_ accents feels as if it was intentional. Almost like a dig towards Irish people lol
Great content
Some of these could have spoken Icelandic and I wouldn't have noticed the difference.
that lady "teaching irish accents" is mental. She says in American we say "i" in oil? As in Iile?
Member when he first started youtube3 and everybody keeped saying something along the lines of I have a Irish uncle and Jack isn't Irish.
I can actually understand the understandable Irish better than the guy in clarksons farm from the Cotswolds. Though we met a farmer on the Arran islands that we just could not understand at all. If I listen to Irish too long it just sticks to my tongue. Love it! Love it soo much!
I think there is a universal truth for us English speakers whether we are English, Welsh, Scottish, Irish, American, Canadian, Australian, etc. At some point when we head out into the country, we come across people who make us think to ourselves "Yeah......have no idea what the fuck you're talking about...."
Farty-five sheep?! That’s alotta sheep!😂
Farty-five sheep?! That’s alotta sheep!
In the news about the stolen sheep, I believe the only things I understood were "fourty five" and at the part about how they could have been stolen with the help of a good dog (before Jacksepticeye translates it), which I believe translates as "it's not a' all that difficult, all you have to do is have a good dog. Have a good dog and... go at night and (...) just put the dog around them... put 'em on a (...) and walk 'em" And, as a Brazilian who's self-taught in English since their teens, I think I can be quite proud of this achievement.  Also, Jacksepticeye saying "I'm great at this" is the same as me, a Brazilian Northeasterner reacting to a tutorial on how to sound from Paraíba and saying "córói, né que eu tô pegan'ujeit-?" ("wow, I'm getting the gist of this" in a very heavy accent, for those who don't speak nordestês)
YOU FIERCE GOWL YOU!
Sean your such a nice guy I'm like 25% Irish
I like to think us Australians can SLIGHTY  understand the irish accent a little easier. Probably because of both of our habit to slur some of the words together. Either way, this video was hilarious :D
Apparently I suck at recognizing accents
how dare he use the phrase 'away with the fairies' that's incredibly homophobic
You should watch the boondock saints
I WATCH AMERICAN MOVIES WITHOUT TRANSLATION. IRISH ... AND SCOTTISH GIVE ME GREAT HEADACHES. IT'S PROBABLY DONE SO THAT MORE PEOPLE CAN UNDERSTAND WITHOUT THE NEED FOR TRANSLATION. English is not my 1st language. I used google for this.
Bro don’t worry you do not sound like that to us Americans.
"Eat shit france"  spoken like a true man of the british isles
That south dublin hurt... I mean it's really accurate for Dalkey or Blackrock but no where else!!!
Nooo you sound perfect! Thank you for translating these crazy Irish videos, I felt horrible I couldn't get it!
To me the English accent is the sexiest in the world! Damn, one word with an English accent and I'm captivated!
I think in Snatch his character was supposed to be intentionally hard to understand when talking to people to help with him conning them. Taking that into account I think the accent came off pretty well. Pretty sure at some point Statham's character says something about it too.
As an Irish lad myself I tell u that I have never heard anyone say top of the morning
I'm from Ireland I can understand the farmer a little bit
My word. This was a fun video. It popped up in my recommended and it felt like when I had some Australian news reports come across my recommended videos a few months back. Fun to listen to and some of it, I understood them
The HERB  Herb? I hardly know him
'let me know if you can understand this accent' me: reads the subtitles
I noticed Swedish was number 7 on that chart. What about Swedish people who don't really have an accent? Like Simone Gertz?
Hilariously enough, the further into the video the better I was at comprehending their accents 😂
I hate when you ask me to subscribe in your videos... like.. i have to hit unsubscribe.. then hit subscribe.. EVERY VIDEO ... DAMN.. MY CLICKING FINGER HURTS
You're so right ab the sheep farmer. The hot fuzz scene 😭😂 I always come back to this video lmao
Sean + Christopher Watkins trying to be Irish = Arnold Schwarzenegger
Oh my Gosh I miss Ireland 😭
the guy with the paper bag on his head is a refrence to the band rubberbandits
I have been scrolling the comments to see if anyone else deciphered what Jack said around 20:13 bc auto captioning aint doin so great
I was doing Irish in school and my teacher played a video and the accent was mad
Naw mate, ye donnae sound like that MacTeagh guy at all I'm not gonna try to spell his name right I'm just spelling it how you pronounced it, yer speakin' perfect clear like English.  Better than a lot of ENGLISH YouTubers I follow in fact.
Everyday I relies Louth is one of the most boring places in the world
Brad Pitt wasn't playing an Irishman in Snatch, he was playing a Pict
Did anyone else see his white board that says kinda sus
Is it strange that I understood the accents? The only one I couldn't quite piece together was the Limerick accent, though that was mostly do to the terminology. I had to look up what 'acting a maggot' meant, or what a 'langer' was.  Acting a maggot: being sloppy, as to be excused from work you don't want to do. Langer: A twit, foolish person, or idiot.
"we're a different breed" i mean in a way...
Vừa vào đã nổi cả da gà 藍giọng a Phúc hayyy quá, mong sẽ tiếp tục cover ạ ❤️
im not natively english so i used to not notice dialects atall, i literally never realized jack's irish accent until i got a bit more used to the english language lol
Poor sheep 🐑😢
Shaun your mother launge Sounds like German ending with british accent but guicker 😁
dere’s more tah Oirlan dan dis
Love coming back to this video. I have an Irish girlfriend and fell in love with her accent the first time I heard her speak. I'm Aussie, which means I've heard my fair share of broken Aussie English. I do love puttin on my accent really hard sometimes talking to her just to confuse her a little 😂
I want him I review boondock saints
Accents are just so fascinating! I love hearing all the different types of accents even just w/in a language. They have like, ten million different variations and quirks w/in a language (and esp when people are speaking other languages), even w/in cities, nvm whole countries. People like to rag on Americans being stereotypically stereotypical about other accents, but for ex, what's usually assumed to be the 'Boston accent' is actually a South Boston accent, kinda like how 'Cockney' is the accent originating in East London. I'd never heard of that Wild Mountain Thyme film but I had to look it up bc I was like 'Jamie Dornan??? I thought he *was* Irish??' And he is, though he's from Northern Ireland. If he's off in the film, I can only assume he played it up for goofiness or it's bc he's trying to mimic an accent from a different area of Ireland. There seem to be a couple of other Irish actors, but none in the main parts.
"mIUuUSiC yOU cAlL iT?" KHSDGSDBGISB
By the way, aer wae sherr taht aern't Linzay Loan thaer pretenn teh bae Becca thaer? I'm not Irish, but I bet Jack read and understood exactly what I wrote right thaer. Also I think a bit of British annunciation has infiltrated into some Irish dialects and it's a shame. I prefer to have a reason to not understand the women I'm attracted to.
Why do some Irish people put so much emphasis on the letter H in words? Is that a specific dialect? Like ... they do it worse than Stewie Griffin does. Also why do some people pronounce heat as heath? What's up with that? It's not a T not a theta, bros. As an expert, Jack, please explain.
All these stereo types ha aha
Father Jack
Top of the morning to ya
I also thought it was English accent lmaooo
As a brittish person it also pisses me off that americans think all english accents are the same but they clearly arent there is multiple different British dialects but people seem to think we all sound like the Cockney accent or the posh Queens English I'm looking at you Family guy and the Simpsons were the same as you  go to New York you'll hear New Yorker accent go to Texas  Texans don't sound like a person from New York
I’d like to know jacks reaction to a Newfie accent lol
The Irish accent is the sexiest in the world        It's the most sexiest
christopher walken trying to be irish sounds like a stoned version of Arnie Schwartzburger
Just had to laugh at the appearance of The Rubber Bandits at the end there when discussing Limerick.
Jacksepticeye is so Irish that he's dubbed as the last vowel-bender. 😂
LOL I couldn't understand anything the whole time
"I don't sound like that. And if I do, I'm so sorry."  This made me bust out laughing. Don't worry Jack. You have a gorgeous voice and accent.
If ye miss it so much come back and let's get a pint in Bruxelles like.                                         tiocfaidh ár lá
Irish War with fake Irish
Ok I understand the farmer but not Brad pitt
HE'S A VOWEL BENDER!
As an Irish person, Jesus Christ the farmer with the missing sheep was so are to translate
Its mad cause my English mum can understand the sheep farmer just fine. Mind you, she did spend a good 10 years living in rural Ireland and Cork (West and in the city).
im irish i didint understand the farmer
Me watching Derry Girls over 10 times makes me feel like I studied for this video.
Can Jack speak Irish?
that is the worst vocal coach ive ever heard, it depends on where you are, like saying someone from dublin, someone from the north, and someone from the south all have the same accent aside from flower and sour and our this is the worst accent ive ever heard
The "sheep-man" spoke with, kinda like a norwegian accent, with a tint of a british, and then he randomly threw in some german words.
I am proud to say i understood everything that farmer said, 13 years here was worth it (I also understood the other ones)
Northern Ireland’s no better
How did i fall asleep to this
Dude this is so funny. I’m an Irishman, but I don’t have as strong of an accent, I don’t even sound like jack, well, not as strong of an accent at least 😂😅
The louth accent isint a louth accent
I am irish  and its fucking hilarious when people try to do an irish accent
Watched since 40k lol man that was a while ago holy crikey haven't checked your channel in a few years, didn't know you were so huge now
I loved this
When he’s mocking the “he had a rock around his neck” he sounded like Arnold schwrarzneger  P.s. I know I spelled it wrong
“OIL-land” 😂 I don’t know what that lady was on about
5:35 Sorry, I couldn't even make out one word!
Handsome man
Someone: **says a joke** Me: ok Jack saying "eat shit France" with an irish accent Me: *wheeze*
Farty five is a lot sheep
Stayed on a dairy farm in Rylane and couldn’t understand the host but got to watch the cows get milked and amazing views. It’s a cute little place on air bnb if anyone sees this a year later lol
Omg wow, never knew that pewdiepie could do an Irish accent so well!! I’ve always loved him though. I’ll have to watch his new jack septic channel or whatever.
Being Southern, I understand.
The only thing you can understand from that shepherd dude without translation is "in the mountains", "25 sheep missing", and "whatcanbedoneaboutitnothing".  The rest is a leprechaun having a stroke.
It's interesting how we group accents/dialects into these huge, overarching groups (mostly for convenience) and then realizing just how wildly different things vary within a relatively small area (sometimes even within a city).
0:23 I think it's hilarious that Australian is 5 lol
That old man was speaking Gaelic
*Somehow understands almost every word even though I am american.*
12:20 I think irishcentral has said there are no less than 32 accents and dialects of Irish, so that would make sense
Oh my lord I just had four men from Ireland check in and one of their accents was so thick like the farmers I had such a hard time understanding him lol beautiful accent though
2nd vid: I can't understand a thing 🥴 and I'm Irish. 3rd vid: "Accent?" More like foreign language! No you don't sound horrible, I can understand you perfectly. You have an accent but you're still english speaking - no gibberish mumbo gumbo. 💕💐
And this is why I wish I were Irish
Russian cursive scares me
I'm having a problem, I hear audio but there's no video playing, it's completely black
farty five sheep DAYUM
In Sweden we have an accent that has an inhale sound that means ”yes”
I can’t even hear the different Swedish accents
Accents are one of my favorite things. It's so fun! I love to guess where people are from. And the way sentences can get twisted and kind of behave like an inside joke. It's just nice, that's all.
Wonder if Jack knew any of the try channel crew.
im from longford and my grandma started dating a man from Kerry and i CANNOT understand him lol and last time he was trying to talk to me i felt so bad i just said "i dont know what youre saying" :(
"Go back to sleep child start drinking more milk [___]!" I was just laughing! In the morning! That just made my day!
this was amazing , I love the Irish accents
Major insult towards Spanish and French them a minor insult towards Scottish bro respect😂
Dude be like: "Get Iraq tied to his Neck"
Oh how I love self rising fleeeeeerr
0:38 I am literally in bed drinking milk the second he said this!
Irish is 100% the sexiest accent I take no criticism
She was bleedin English 😅😂🤣 as a Canadian i find your guys version of English FUCKIN PRICLESS 👌 not being disrespectful but Canadian stereotypes are just as wrong as your guys are 😅😂🤣
My opinion on the sexiest accent: 1. Irish, 2. Aussie, 3. Scottish
I think that the Australian accent is the best :ps I am Irish so I have no biases
Bro's speaking leprechaun instead of Irish
Brad pitt was one of the better attempts. Sure he stumbled quite a bit, but hey, he got the jist of it.
Irish people sound like they're just constantly drunk.
Irish people really do talk fast
Dude im just waaching this on st patricks day and infact.. im even irish
Jack following an Irish accent  tutorial while being Irish:  "I'm great at this !!" 😂
when your Irish and u only understand half of what these people are saying XD
He’s not speaking English surely
I can vaguely understand the farmer he doesn't even sound like he is speaking English I have failed my  Irish heritage
I wanna live in Ireland it just seems so chill
I think brad Pitt actually lived with gipsies for a bit to prepare for the role to make sure he moved and sounded like a traveler
He knows not to mess with Australia cuz we'll send the spiders
Idk why, but for some reason, even though I'm indian, I was able to understand the rowers accents, and even a little bit of the farmers accents
Irish accents are quite lovely
there all good
Anyone can go right here an taike m
Try a Belfast accent
i love irish accents lmao
Irish and Bajans sound sooooooo alike lol I love it.
The sheep farmer. I can understand many near incomprehensible accents, and I can't understand anything.
wow butiful irish accent
8:21 mans said "frhaussbutt""
This is why I don't think many of the "over top" accents that actors do aren't actually that bad. There are real accents out there and individuals within that actually do sound like what the actor imitates or even crazier.
Reminds me of the Australian video where there was a lighting strike behind a guy and his girl and it’s like “OH MAH GAH THA BLOODY LOININ BOLE JUSS MISSTEW!” the captions are hilarious!
Yes I'm on my grandma tablet
Sure I am an Irish boy from Cork I know what he is saying
Flour is apparently flare "everyone she has a flare " set her on fire first not me I have a dandilion
Is the woman okay il oil wrong her brain has disconnected
Frost bat terraria is what he said
His mistake was saying Anthony not antony
Female Irish Accents are hot and I am in England. Great video Jack. Did you ever play beyond two souls the developers of Detroit become human?
yall im irish im saying this bc  i understand everyone lol
I understand roughly half of this because I am from ‘NORTHERN’ Ireland
Huh
The rowers weren’t that hard to understand tbh
i got about half of the farmers accent but the farmers where i live google translate would fecking struggle ..its probably better to just think of it as farmerese that theyre speaking
Technically Brad pitt wasn't doing an Irish accent.
We need to see @Jacksepticeye react to a newfoundland accent! We're like the Irish your ma says you Ave at home! lol
i wasn't fully convinced the sheep farmer was actually speaking english for a hot second 😭
The “ H erb”
How Jack feels about Irish accents is how I feel about Jamaican accents. Hollywood butchers ours, too.
0:40 I think you mean Irish whiskey
I’m Irish but not from the motherland. I’m 2nd gen American and I even have slight accent from listen to my gpa and father. But mostly sound American with Irish slang. Only fucking kid in Cleveland calling friends mates
No fucking way that was English lmao only thing I ever understood was 45 sheep and bright out
Finally, my knowing of every Irish county is useful.
That guy from The Simpson’s, he was Irish I think but what part of Ireland anybody know?
Brad Pit nailed it lads. He was spot on, come on.
u should watch niall horan speaking sometimes
And you wonder why I changed Siri to Irish
''no love for you scotland'' me is scottish owch that hurt jackie-poo
Brad Pitt is doing gypsy accent not Irish haha
Second girl in the last video sounded exactly like atlas from bioshock
i started to understand them the further i watched the video
Jack, your Chris Walken accent is as good as his Irish accent is. Sorry bub.
a lads that farmer wasnt even speaking english tf hahaha
Same thing scottish at the start.
Another very funny "Irish accent" is Sean Connery in The Untouchables
Wild Mountain Thyme is not made for Irish audiences, clearly. This is how we all imagine Irish people sound in North America.
20:16 Irish ~ 🕳
Am I the only one that thought the accents at 5:06 sounded Japenese? No? Just me? Ok-
My mams side of the family is from Dublin and my dads side is from Tipperary, but I live in Dublin so I don’t see my dads side too often.  You have not heard a more gibberish Irish accent until you’ve heard a Tipperary accent. I cant understand half of what my family’s saying  when I visit.
I can surprisingly understand that school boy
0:28 noticed how he stopped at Australia.
My nan cringed so hard watching this. That all that’s left is a butthole muscle.
I just want to see Jack react to the conversation between Sean MacGuire and Molly O'Shea in Red Dead Redemption 2 for some reason
That mad accent guy sounds like reversed English
im dying inside of how much im laughing, damn, dont worry jack i'll probably let ya back in to ireland
im irish :)
Fun fact Louth accent and Drogheda accent are two completely different things
to be fair at 03:30 they do explain its not quite irish, its well.. pikey... Now that's almost definately now classed as a racist statement but they were making out its a deliberate rouse to make it hard to understand them in negotiations rather than being irish.
The real question is. Can irishmen with strong accent understand regular english
“Eat shit French” ah yes this is the normal now
I'm not sure if my likes count; if it's someone I'm subscribed to, I tend to hit "like" to signify to myself that I've seen the video...  But hey, +1 like?  Would like it a second time if I could, because the laughter! I love it! And a third time for the accenting, especially since it made me realize the source of some of my speech quirks (I had an "Irish" accent (I don't remember the specific one, would have to look into where my father's family came from again) as a kid; trained myself out of it due to relentless bullying)  (Edit: The demonstrated County Cork one seems closest to the one)
“I’m great at this already”  I WONDER WHY
Waaaait Scottish and Irish sound different!?!!?!?
If only everywhere was Irish.
Your one and your man
Shawn! teach us Irish slangs!
This reminds me of Sean Connery trying to be Russian in ‘Hunt for Red October.’ “Just one ping Vasiliy just one ping.”
2:21 IM SORRY BUT JACK SOUNDED LIKE GRU FROM DESPICABLE ME
I think I have a good Irish accent
In Australia we say mira instead of mirrrrr
Farty five….
Your one from Kerry is 100% English not Irish
As someone with Audio Processing Problems, to me everybody sounds like that farmer.
You got some gray hair
sorry I can't like this video because  its at 420k
Yup Ireland 🇮🇪 👌
My mother who is actually not a native english speaker understood the guy needless to say I was surprised
Sean Mac'n'cheese. Got it.
frostbit is a valid word. Its an alternative for future tense of frostbite.
I got a jacksepiceye ad on this vid
Lol jack sounded like gru 2:22
I live in Kerry, and trust me, most of the time i can't even figure out what they're saying 😅
Bondurant jeuen jejej jwuw77uu
In Denmark there are also some accents most of the Danish people can’t understand…
Trying my hardest to understand how Scottish got in the top 3
I’d say Americans don’t get a word anyone says in this vid XD but great job Jack keep up the good work
I tried. I tried very hard to understand that sheep man. I got nothing.
SEAN MAC  SEAN GLOCK
New York accent is far better
00:16:24 i already did a few hours ago!
PLEASE I LOST IT ON leprechauns on acid
it's weird that he's talking english, i understand and speak english yet can't make out anything he's saying
This was a treat 😊. I'm fair at hearing through a thick Irish (and Scottish) accent), so it's fun to get stumped by a really really heavy one. Thanks for the translation. I love hearing your own accent as well, twas noticeably thicker as you went, sounds so right 👌.
Racism
not gonna like, I love Irish accent... I WANT AN IRISH HUBBY
As somebody from Kerry I can confirm that is not a Kerry accent. As with all counties, there’s no single accent but her accent was not even Irish.
That brad Pitt one was legendary
To be fair to Brad Pitt, his accent was supposed to be traveller rather than straightup Irish, so Irish but not quite sounds about right
I'm irish and from tipperary and I don't think I have an accent but anyone not from Ireland says I have the heaviest accent they have ever heard
Every square metre in Ireland has it’s own accent
The Irish accent is the most sexy? Who did that poll?
I just realized, some Irish accents remind me of Canadian.
Irish sounds how cursive looks to a dyslexic
I learned English as my second language and I thought I'm pretty alright with it... this is another level I would have to conquer😭😭😭😭
My grandma has an accent and she’s from Northern Ireland, I sometimes can’t understand what the crap she says lol 😂
This is how I feel when I watch people making a South African accent and then choose the Afrikaans version instead of the English or the other 9 languages' accents! Then again, SA is a bit more diverse...
My Nan is from America so she was herb like ‘erb’ and I pronounce it with the H and I’m Irish FYI
Irish isn't sexy, it's incomprehensible. Upper class London women have the best accents...
IM ALREADY IN BED
I am Irish
WHAT EVEN IS THE CONTEXT TO BRAD PITT BEING IN A GANG OF TRAVELLING CARAVAN BUYERS
This might be the first video on any channel I've seen when they show the ratio of subscribed viewers is a higher percentage than not. That's actually huge well done 👏
I be northan Irish
Me being part Irish not knowing if I have an Irish accent:
guess this is how non english speakers feel when they are around us lol
It’s true. Jacks sexiness is like 75% due to his accent and swearing and I love it
I have audio processing issues so I usually have the CC on. Got to say, the auto generated CC for the Irish accents was suprisingly accurate even though it sounded like random noise to me.
it kind of sounds like he's speaking irish at some points and then goes back to english but still with an accent
I just love hearing other people's accents. My boyfriend is from America and sometimes he sounds so American, he says there are times my accent shines through so much he can't understand me and I'm from Australia mate
I saw that video with the sheep and was only able to pick up a small portion of the first guy, and I didn't know the second guy was taking about dogs. I heard dougin, and I didn't connect that to Dog.
I understood all of em, be more Irish laddie
Omg what is it with Brad Pitt, there’s a film he was in where he ends up doing a Jamaican like patois thing (I’m Jamaican). I swear to god every so often I watch the clip on yt it’s hilarious, hearing him say “Irie” LMAOOO I can’t 💀
not every irish person has an accent that you would call irish
theres more than two farms per mile
Brad is supposed to be an Irish traveler in the movie not Irish
The person that comes to my mind when I see the word Irish is either Jacksepticeye Or Niall Horan  gotta love them both
third place. not bad
Love how I, being from Kerry, can understand the farmer with barely an issue
It sounded like he said Fortnite 6:47
To be fair Brad Pitt's accent is purposely described by the film itself as "not Irish, not English, it's well...Pikey".
Irish people sound like they are always at the point of pass-out-drunk when you can't do anything but mumble.
the last segment reminds me of how Texans have different accents depending on the area. We all dont sound like cowboys.
The ain’t an accent 🤣 das a whole new language 😭
It seems to me that the Irish accent almost sounds like yelling or being chipper.  What do I know? I have an Utah American accent and it’s trashy. 😂
I am certain that Brad Pitt is doing a mash up of accents, it's not just irish
I'm from Newfoundland, Canada. We mainly descend from Ireland. I understood everything, haha.
The Irish: fuck English!
Brad Pitt plays the role of a pikey in snatch. It’s a mixture of English European accent and Irish. I know I’m late to this but he doesn’t just play an Irishman.
Hmm
Well, it could be worst, they could go full Gaeilge instead of talking English. Now it would be really impossible to understand.
The first one the accents sound Scottish. And yes, I'm part Scottish.
I find this hilarious, I have family in Ireland that we visit every year so funnily enough I understood near enough as much as you did 🤣
The 'how to do an irish accent' video just sounds like shes doing a Scottish accent
"It shit France!"  Me :that fair
I'm surprised our cork boy Kevin isn't here
"These sausage. With love." Please someone give my ears therapy
Brad Pitt was playing a Traveller. I've listened to them on a few documentaries and they sound like they're speaking Irish by skipping every 3rd letter. Then, speed it up x2 and you've got Brad as a Traveller.
What in the absolute rat fuck was that farmer sayin?
11:32 sounding like Father Jack from Father Ted, DRINK!
U missed Shane McGowen😂( the pouges)
Youtube subtitles got like 20 percent of what the old dude was saying and then just gave up.
Ps. Your Christopher Walkin impression SENT ME so hard I almost woke up my 3yo smh 😂
One of the funniest vids of u bro. Lol I love Jack
That lady was either on something or aggressively embarrassed to be in a blindfold.
Also that's snow Scotland would just say its a normal day
Brad pits accent is a irish gypsy accent Jack
Go home America you're drunk
Sean is absolutely right. Every country has multiple different accents and they all come with the varieties of different voices, cultures and personalities. Just listen to the differences between a New York (Bronx) style accent, a Tennessee southern (Howdy!) lilt, and a laid back Californian (Dude!) voice and you'll see what I mean.
7:45 yes man lmfao  love from USA
I love irish accents they sound so soothing to me lol
I keep getting into arguments about the pronounciation of certain words in the bavarian dialect (part of germany) and everyone is dead set on convincing me that their pronounciation is right and mine is wrong. They're all right. Within a 75km radius I've gathered 4 variations for the bavarian word "over there" (in German it's "drüben")  If you're curious: driam, dream, dreant, drent
It's so weird Jack didn't get the Rubberbandits reference
jackspedicey
Also being an irish lad me self we don't say 'oil' nearly as pronounced as she dod
Wait right ima cork lad me self but do ppl find it hard to understand  these?to me this is simple English
I have to be surrounded by only Irish people 5 days a week every week but after 2 years I still have no bloody clue what that farmer is saying
I’m surprised that I could understand some of the things that the Irish lads were saying
I can only understand that sheep farmer because my aunt is from Ireland and her accent is HEAVY
I’ve literally seen news stories about sheep on Welsh news too—any accent other than english and people never understand you. I should know, I live in England but after a few weeks in wales visiting family and friends and I’d come home sounding fucking Welsh, having little shites at school asking me to say Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch 😂😅
In Snatch they say, "its not English...its not Irish...its...well...Pikey" 😆 They also say or infer that they do it on purpose so outsiders can't understand them.
I’m part Irish and my friend says I sound Irish but I’m american
No joke, I’m from Cork and when I heard the olympians talking I was like “clear as day, what’s the problem” and when he started translating I realized “oh, maybe not so much”
I am Irish and even I could not understand the Irish man
Still like farther Jack as a Irish accent coach. " Drink! ,Grils, Sex!"
I love how even the Irish folks are having trouble with the farmer lmao
THIS MAN PRONOUNCED THE "H" IN HERB
My top two favorite accents are Irish and Scottish in that order. I don't know why they just sound so pleasing to hear.
Wish my mother-language was used in movies. Would probably judge movies the first 40-100 years of it, but the pride would be LEAKING :')
D
This feels like the Irish example of me watching literally any movie where they try to do a southern American accent
When Sean translates the farmer accent, I can hear and understand what they're saying. But Holy Hell, having to listen and identify the sounds on my own takes more levels of listening and translation than my brain can do in the time it takes those folks to speak
Brad got the accent right but sounds like he's drunk
Hearing the County Cork accent, it definitely is the accent that's portrayed the most in entertainment over the others
Jack……Jasaaaack……
What about Cavan? I want you to talk about Cavan.
This reminds me of how most of Newfoundland  the bay accents r brutal and most main landers r confused by our slang or straight up don't understand any of us
Imagine this with dutch dialects, shits funny.
“go back to bed, child” 😭😭
Don’t forget “fookin’ ‘ell”…
Jesus. As someone who has been around Border Collies for many years, we hear some crazy Scottish accents, but I only caught about half of what that dude was saying about his missing sheep. We have some world-class sheepdog handlers come to trials over here, and it's fucking HILARIOUS to see them telling a story, and all the other people will be smiling and nodding, and as soon as the Scot walks away, everyone's like, "Did anyone catch any of that?" LOL!!!!! A lot of classic sheepdog training videos done by old Scottish men have trained my ears a bit, but the slang still goes right over my head. It is funny to hear many American and Canadian handlers, who speak with "no" accent, suddenly turn Scottish when they're working sheep though. So many years of watching and hearing Scottish handlers just wears off on them, and it makes me laugh every time like, some dude from the midwest starts screaming, "LIE DOON!" to his dog. LOL!
I am an Irishman and the C R I N G E in the videos
Okay I noticed that with a few examples of these accents, why does it seem like they're talking with their mouth 1/3 of the way open?! Like no fucking shit I can't understand you... It's not your accent, YOUR JAW IS BROKEN
Honestly, as an American, I could barely hear your accent lmao. At first I wasn't 100%  sure that you were born and raised in Ireland. You speak normally, it isn't hard to understand you at all.
My name is Irish for poet and old french for devine....but i do have french in me so XD
Oiland 😂. She should try and do a Dublin accent sometimes they r hard to understand
It makes me happy that the anchor’s name is like Seán Mac An Cheese, but if you were to sneeze through the last word
"He had a rock tied to his neck" Man you killed me with that
2:11 HE LOVES EMILY BLUNT!!!! LESBIANS REJOICE! (emily blunt is my 5 year favourite human being but yes it so TERRIBLE but I'm obsessed w her and I will never talk negatively abt her (except for this movie) like why did she do it tho)
he's so funny xD "try saying mirror, it's just m+i with 15 rs" xD
Brad Pitt’s is more of a traveler accent
I’m American but have family from cork county
2:50 So have ya had the time to watch it yet? @jacksepticeye
my ears fucking enjoyed this!
I'm not even Irish (though I do believe I have some Irish roots, I heard some say that my last name is Irish originally, though that may just be because it's similar to Patrick/Padraig so they get that 'vibe' from it, for all I know, never did the research), and the Cork accent and the fake exaggerated version of it that Hollywood uses are basically the only Irish accents I was familiar with before this video, but even I could tell that that one from "County Kerry" was just English.
Thyme is a "herb" 😄😄
Do the Irish have beef with scotland?
Lads I can’t be the only one how’s granddad speaks exactly like your sheep man
Awk Jack wish ye had have listened to the northen irish accent
Im sorry!? Swedish at nr 7 sexiest accents. No way. We sound horrible an ridiculous!
If we went to America and you said to a gaurd what's the craic  and he thought u said weres the craic
🇮🇪🇮🇪🇮🇪
Omg bad acting or what...Brad pitts accent is a mess
How can I understand this
The dude in that in the "American listen to Irish accent" video was cringey as hell
I keep coming back here to practice the accent in the first half of the videos before he gets to the wannabe accents. I want to connect with my Irish relatives and not have to ask them to repeat themselves.
😂😂😂😂😂😂
LMAO OMG 19:20 COOOOORK 😂😂😂
15:39 COUNTY CORK AND KILLSHENDARA!!!!
Both sides of my family come from County Cork. One from East Cork City and One from West (St. Shannon Parish) County Cork and both sound different 🇺🇸
Funny…Google auto translate goes word for word brilliantly
im not a native english speaker, but i've studied english for more than 5 years, and i can safely say, i have not understood 98% of this video.
Sean’s accent just gets 10x thicker when he’s around other Irish people yeah?? 😂😂
Nah, travellers talk like that man. You can't convince me otherwise.
5:32 my grandpa talks exactly like this when i’m on the phone with him i can barely work it out but i’m getting better considering living in australia where u don’t hear many irish accents but the people from home always call + aus has a nice irish community:)
There comes a point in time when an accent becomes a language…some of these are literal examples
0:27
6:08 "Why would anyone go up to the mountains and steal my Elytra?" Damn didn't know he was a hardcore Minecraft player 🤣
Bruh my accent must be extremely sexy cause I’m Irish and Scottish
Brad pitt kinda tried. But that o'l farmer o'fella is best and that school lad man we as a people just don't care
irish is one of my top three... i was in northern ireland and it didnt seem to be the thickest...
This is actually one of my favorite videos. I come back from time to time.
Irish accents are attractive asf! Just saying!🤪
Well Sean! loved this video it was gas craic. Had a pain in me hole with the laughing, or maybe I just needed a good shite
I think the Madeline woman had a thicker accent
Have yall ever seen p.s. I love you
Wait he moved from Ireland?? I’m so late
its been awhile since I've watched a video on this channel and I gotta say I'm liking it. keep up the good work Sean.
Okay so the first "how to do an irish accent" it soinds more norweigen viking than it does irish on some things, at least to me anyway, it just sounds like shes trying to be hiccups dad or mother, idk been a few years since i watched em
I remember when people would say that you we’re faking being Irish ☘️😭
You sound like Charlie day from its Always Sunny in Philadelphia.  Lol
Rip my language 😂
Irish is the worst form of English ever…
Anyone remember when house of pain did a song called top o the mornin to ya? And then shamrocks and shenanigans. 🤣
Why can I understand the "the mad accent"? beacause I have a grandad thats why
Accent Big Foot an domhain
A bit off topic but isn't Wild Mountain Thyme a SCOTTISH song!?
Don’t worry, He was just speaking in an accent beyond his range of hearing.
That South Dublin impression stung but maybe I’m just in denial because I live in South Dublin
OMG I remind when that first frostbit clip came out, my cousin showed it to me
I almost forgot that irish farmer was speaking english lol.
I’m second-gen jamaican, I can really hear the Irish influence in our dialect and accents after watching the farmers 😂
I have a pretty thick irish accent and when ever i say ‘your one over there’ My inner Irish accent kicks in and it’s very thick
This is terrible ALL THEY HAVE TO SAY IS THE SPUDS ARE BOILING these are English
I thought a British accent was better…
Only one I couldn’t understand a lick was the first sheep farmer. I’m used to people butchering my language. I was in the Navy.
I'm irish and I can't even understand
I wonder if Jack has watched young offenders. Fucking hilarious Irish comedy.
The best Irish accent on TV would be father ted
I remember as an Irish person all the talk about this joke of a movie
6:57 irish tom hanks? :D
Wild Mountain Thyme was a very cute and very weird movie.
There is a disabled person nearby in the place i’m in that when he talks it’s mostly mumble but he doesnt talk randomly Like when we visited his place he asked to my broda (in my language not english) “do you want to connect to wifi?” and my broda got confused for a moment and few seconds later he understood
When the Kerry one came on I thought "well shit that's a really strong Irish accent" jack and everyone in the comments - she's bleedin English.
1) No, Jack. Your accent is nowhere NEAR that thick. 2) Actually, it sounds a lot the Newfoundlanders accent.
How to have a Irish accent 101, POTATOES
Mikey joe has my last  name
The farmer sounds like he’s summoning a fucking demon
It's not the accent that's the issue, the non pronunciation of the words is.
I mean northside Dublin girl was pretty cute
It's okay, Diane Jennings gave you specifically a pass on saying that phrase lol
That farmer had an awful thik accent and I’d sure holy god I’m form Ireland and could barley understand
I am pointing and laughing at the spelling of Sean Mac An tSithigh like Moe.
5:30 Jesus that accent is so heavy it almost sounds like he's speaking Norwegian 😂😂😂
please do one of these again, they're absolutely hilarious
Brad Pitt's accent is not supposed to be Irish.
how much beer do you drink
😆😆 This guy laughing is what was so damn funny!! Irish accents are absolutely awesome but THAT GUY ^^ is hilarious while watching videos!
"Mikey Joe O'Shea" dang
"Get fucked, Italy!"   ... and I took that personally 😆🇮🇹🇺🇲
This reminds me of newfoundland accent from Canada.
I my self have a mid-western “classic” American accent and my aunts, uncles and cousins all have the strongest country Kerry accents I’ve ever heard so nether of us can understand each other
Those Dublin accents were pathetic
Jack has a low key American accent tho and this is coming from an irishman
I once had a friend who believed that the "I" in "Ireland" was silent. Then again he was a little down on the IQ Chart so I don't blame him.
around 9 years ago i could have fully understood farmer guy.. lolz about half now tho.. good ol ex especially when drunk 😂
Seán an dtuigeann tú é seo tá mé ag staidéar conas Gaeilge a labhairt agus má thuigeann tú é ansin tá a fhios agam go bhfuil ag éirí go maith liom Tá mé 10% Éireannach
That farmer is the Irish version of Boomhauer from king of the hill
As a dane, it wasn't that hard to understand the farmer for some reason XD
The rowers from Cork just sounds like old Norwegian people being really bad at English!
Dude I’m from the south and I’m not gonna lie there’s some deeeeeppp south accents that I can’t translate 😂
Almost as bad as a newfoundland accent
house of gucci is the old mountain thyme for italians
I’m guessing South Ireland accents are the equivalent the American Deep South accents.
Brad Pitt was playing a traveller in snatch.....
Once upon a time, there were two mice, that fell into a... bucket of cream
my dad has a thick brogue, he was born and raised in Cork , I understand him but most people dont in the U.s.. this is the funniest video ive seen in months,.
i'm american but i love visiting my irish cousins, they really do have the best accent
When I lived in Michigan, we would drive up to Kitchener, Ontario quite often. Kitchener has a LOT of Newfie's up there,.  I have never heard such a combination of accents in my life than listening to a gaggle of Newfies talking amongst themselves. Irish, Scottish, French, German were all heavily represented.   For such a sparsely populated area, the amount of dialects you hear is kind of mind boggling.   Still, hands down, the nicest people I've ever met. 5 minutes after meeting one, you're family, no questions asked.
Farty five eh? That's a stinking lot of sheep!
"Irish people really are a different breed"  me, an Irish person: Yes we are  I understood every accent accept for the farmers
I love all of the Irish accents...I'm from Texas, and I totally understand how you can have a different accent if you're from a different area, even in the same state
I love all of the Irish accents...I'm from Texas, and I totally understand how you can have a different accent if you're from a different area, even in the same state
In America we get a fire under our ass, but in Ireland you get frostbutt.
How to Irish accent KINDA SUS 🧐
Why do Irish accents sound like patois?
Me :- Can barely understand british and australian english Irish English :- Hello There Mortal
I'm thankful to have worked along side an Irishman for several years (we work in California). His perspective on America and Americans is refreshing, because he doesn't bullshit. He calls out BS when he smells it, and you can call him out on his BS too - No harm, no foul. Irish people just naturally bring joy to a conversation, assuming you can understand them.
Brad pits was meant to be an northern Irish Gypsy accent
Col 3:8, But now ye also put off all these; anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy communication out of your mouth. Also, * 1 Corinth 15:3-4, 3For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; 4And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures: * Romans 10:9, 9That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.
Comment 🇮🇪 if your Irish
Lmao I can see how this would be slightly offensive😭😂
Farty five 😂 i love it😂
I'm Irish and I could understand all of them lol
And Scottish
I have irish in me
I'm Italian Irish but still American and love to see long green hills and orange roofing
But I brings views
"we dont actually say "top of the mornin' to ya ladies" so you mean to tell me after all this time....its all been a LIE!?
This was hilarious Jack. Wheel dunn…
You looked like ewan mcgregor at this Time damn
You should look into Louisiana bayou swamp people and the creole influenced English they mumble. It's almost as bad.
BRO, IF U PLAYED THE GAME DONT TAKETHE RISK, THE GUYS NAME IS SOO HOT AND HES FRENCH
In Sweden the accents and dialects depends on where you go. They're quite distinct a well. In Stockholm when you're ordering meatballs with ashed potatoes at a lunch restaurant they might ask: "Vill du ha lingon till det?" It translates to "Do you want lingonberries with that?". Where I'm from we say "Sa'ru ha kröser te' de'?". Our dialect is usually referred to as a "farmer dialect" since our county is flatter than a loli. In the west, north-west and south it's like Darkness and the east, north and north-east is like Megumin from Konosuba.
I thought maybe I could understand a bit of what he was saying and then jack translated and I felt like I had been watching a man speaking a different language
Sean's voice is music to my nostrils 😏
The t sound is replaced with an sh sound, does that mean that people have been speaking Irit and we always thought it was Irish?
"I just say 'M' 'I' and 15 'R's". I'm dead lmao
County Cork is my favorite one. My friend Patricia is from cork.
Im from cork and the rower lads didnt have a strong accent  at all
Have you heard Newfoundlander? (Newfoundland, Canada)  Julianne Moore said it was the hardest accent she ever had to learn and described it as "Irish Canadian "
The more I listen to the mad accent clip, the more I hear and understand him lol
I love this hilarious video. BTW It's the same here in northern Austria. Some local accents are very much incomprehensible, even to a native German speaker.
I don’t know how I found this video, but I’m glad I did. This was great!
Jack almost doesn’t sound Irish anymore
I personally love the Irish accent, i wish i could pull it off aha
Some of these accents were closer to newfoundland canadian than irish
a m a i and 115 RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR hahahahaha
AHHH MADELEINE HARVEY IS MY COUSIN
You should stream you watching the movie from the start
Irish accent beats rest of the world, guys can also put you under that table any day, kids.  Go back to yer mummy.  Also, there are many accents depending the the area you came from in that country, just the same as most countries... take it with a pinch if ya catch my drift lad  All that said, I'm English with an Irish grandad, I have the blood and I can understand every word no matter the accent.. love this 😁
I just finished an ireland course online for college. I reallt enjoyed it and it was pretty easy. I'm taking online classes anyways, but it was hard not switching into an irish accent. However, there was a bunch of guest speakers and so it was easier because the accents were different. I am taking German and Irish has been throwing me off. Lol
I'm convinced that the stronger the accent some has the more it sounds like a different language.
me Nan was from cork
😀
5:31 I'm fairly certain that's just Danish
Yeah, I agree. Trying to teach someone to do a country's specific accent is too loaded. You need to specify what area. Those of us in Chicago sound different than those in Mississippi. It's too broad to just say so and so country's accent.
12:58 Lmaoooo, WHAT THE FUCK JEFF!
Am I the only one who thinks Jack's impression of Christopher Walken sounds more like an impression of Arnold Schwarzenegger?
Even better if english is not your first language, I'm a latin spanish speaker talking from experience. Funny enough, we have people like that too, Chile is a weird one, we like to laugh at them, even themselves can't understand their weird words sometimes, and it's weird because their neutral accent can be one of the clearest along with venezuelan and mexican... AND THERE'S ONLY ONE LANGUAGE IN HERE, NOT TWO LIKE IN IRELAND!!!
The third guy with frost bit sounds very eastern canadian.
i can agree, irish accents are top tier
He actually sounds frequently like from Cark. If that's the correct republic? Hard to understand the toon because of the octave increase and thickness.
17:23. I can't be the only one that thought that she sounded very British
I mean it's really funny to hear that woman tell you had to do an Irish accent.. because I have HIV axon and in literally sounds like an Irish accent in the terms of how she's doing it park and garden
This needs to become a series PLEASE. Like to make jack do it
Hang on I thought he was talking about early in the morning he came out to the mountains and then he throw ashit missing how does that translate to it was something to do with the moon and he saw someone 🤣
She's so bad at the accent...
I can do an Irish accent. Of course it's sexy asf
Snatch was one of mine and my dad's favorite movies, we always reference the part when Brad starts talking about the dogs
You don't sound like your off with the fairies either
I was hoping to hear the comparison to a Belfast accent, bc around here is probably the worst accent in the world
well whddaya expect when only the Mick's vote
As someone from county louth and in fact we are the loudest County ever
im half irish and have native american-
wowwwwwwwwwwwwwww so heavy accent
I can tell this now I'm speaking the gospel even tho I'm part Irish but put German I cam do a cute Irish accent
MORE
Forty five not farty five
You should react to strong Newfoundland accent
You should react to strong Newfoundland accent
the most sexiest? are you sure Russia and alien (Mexican) dosent have the best?
When you watched the farmer and the lost sheep and thought you couldn’t understand most of what he was saying..........that’s us trying to figure out what you’re saying most of the time 😂😂
0:13 kait from fallout 4… 2:12 it sounds so forced… I hate it oof (I’m half from Dublin half from Offaly) 3:37 I can’t tell if he’s trying to do a northern Irish accent or Dublin… 5:00 up the county! 7:35 yeah bai let’s go lad 8:10 he’s Northern Irish pretty sure lol 8:56 won gold now lets fuckin go
"A dube gumut hardudv breaking fuutgh" said mad accent farmer
Just asking what's the difference between Irish and Scottish accent?
sean i beg of you to try understand us Aussie!!
Lol great video
I am gringeing so heard
Hahahahahaha that accent
I am Irish
yeh im a vowel bender water air fire earth ALPHABET
This goes beyond just hiring american actors for irish roles but they hired american actors who seem to of never heard an irish accent in their lives
So this is pretty much just like an American watching someone talking in a country accent (sorry country people teehee)
Being Scottish i can understand about 3/4ths but that isnt enough lol
cannot believe that this was a year ago now, time is really flying by
Greatest accent = Jack’s 💚
I remember having to translate mom to people when I was younger, she is Trinidadian and talked a mile a minute
Brad Pitt was making a Welsh accent. Not Irish.
I could easily understand him boy
I don’t think he’s tryna be Irish he’s tryna be a traveler right
i dont want frostbit
I laughed so much at this video 😆😆
As a Bristolian, I relate to having an odd/south west accent 😊
You sound like gru from despicable me
I'm indian and I relate so hard with this lol
With the sheep guy, no matter how hard I try to focus on what he's saying some words just turn into aughthisyahstuaugh
21 minutes of an irish man watching irish men doing very irish things with a thick irish accent.
10:50  lady-oíl  Jack-oil Me-OOL
Still one of my favorite vids❤❤❤
6:43 I am surprised understood like 70% of what that guy said
my brain hurt
every lad knows that every 10km you go its a different accent.
I loved this video haha it was just wonderful for some reason
Irish accents r rlly hot though-
The movie with the actors they didn't do real Irishmen because of money the more famous titles in a movie is more money
the sheep guy sounds like hes speaking made up german
12:40 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
"Smack and go" the title of my autobiography
Understanding gaeilge  listening tests ( with a Ulster accent) is the hardest thing you can do 😂
It’s like 4 am I wasn’t meant to laugh this hard
This video is 5% jack cringing 10% movies and  85% jack talking about his sexy accent
Newfoundland: finally, a worthy opponent
Sexiest accent is Australian.
I wish you could judge the SNL Air Traffic Control skit with James McAvoy doing his heavy Scottish accent but sadly you are only fluent in Irish I guess, lol
I can half translate as a scot
I'm swedish and whenever I try to do an irish accent I always try to channel you :p
The lady teaching the supposedly Irish accent: "In ENGLISH we say 'I', but in an IRISH accent we say 'v;iyfg-9qe7rg'"  What language do they speak there, again?
I know someone from Limerick. It all makes sense now 🤭
Brad Pitt spoke better Italian, than Irish..  And Irish is the English version of the danish dialect from both South Jutland AND Bornholm..
what til it is always sunny next season is in ireland.
pitt isn't irish in snatch
go back to bed ***** 0:43 .. i'm dying 🤣😂
I’m more impressed Sean can understand all of them
Dont worry Jack we know the craic. We all love Ireland when we are living in another country. But the minute we get back home its like, ah jesus back to this shithole again
akjghlhahga,mgalbglankhgajkhlbvla ~Irish Farmer
No way you don't sound like that hahhahaha I can defo understand everything you say. Can't understand anything from what those men say though hahhahahha
Farty fiv?
1:12 hmmmmm she looks familiar… anyone else thinking of what I’m thinking of?
so that's where that annoying american RRRRRR came from.
Yup Kerry
Ypu trying to do a Walken accent was actually SPOT on. He put just about 10% effort into which is unironically how much of your original accent shines through when doing a walken
Well, dude, your accent or maybe it's just your tone of voice, is far from sexy. Grating and obnoxious, maybe.
Irish axennt
I live in London and have a deeply anglisiced accent but It takes me just an hour or two back home to fall shtraight back intuh the limerick
i understood mabye 15 words from the sheep dude
I'm pretty sure I heard moon shine from seân macenche
As a southern American I can relate to the mirror one 😂😂😂 miirrrrr
Nothing elected in 2020 counts, sorry friend.
On the frostbit part it didn’t even sound like english
i watched this nov 24 2021 im scared
Irl
more irish accent videos i beg omg
00:04 hello YouTube timed reader
I live in the south and i could understand the kerry accent barely and thats on my grandfathers waterford culchie accent
Mirrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
My grandad was from Scotland so its easier for me to understand obviously not irish but similar
gypsies like brad pitts character  and the irish im guessing sound a little different theres caravans that gather around here sometimes in yorkshire am guessing the accent changes from people actually living in Ireland
If jack can’t understand it… no one can
"Just put a dagger round em and then put up out there and walk em"  - Apparently he said that all you need is a good dog?  I speak American and also a ton of English and WTF
Christopher Walken is like 80 years old. I think his extremely Heavy Brooklyn Irish NY to Irish is acceptable. I mean in the USA you have to drive 100 miles to find a new accent. In England it's like 10 miles!
I couldn’t understand the farmers but I could understand everyone else, I have Irish ancestors but I’m from New Zealand
If u go to kellys in portrush ul see frostbit he always was there lol
I think the northern irish is the best london derry i dont know why just sounds cool i have to say the irish accent is the best  and i would like to go there and see the country one day maybe london derry or dublin or go south cork, galway not sore which one i would pick
Remember guys, english comes in many ways, but irish? That is a completly diffrent story.
"Im great at this" -Irishman trying to learn irish
the thing is i mimic accents, so gimme a long conversation with an irish person and i'll be mimicing their accent soon enough
I would love to see Jack do one of these on Danish or German accents and/or phrases I think it would be really cool
A couple of Northern Irish comedians were talking about Wild Mountain Thyme's advert, and they likened it to: "Let's make a movie about life in a Japanese Country town" "Should we do a research trip?" "Nah, mate; I've eaten Ramen." "So have I, guess we're golden then. Let's start filming!" Which fits too a little too eerily well to Wild Mountain Thyme's advertising campaign.
My extended family is from the Ring of Kerry and I desperately wish I could both a) understand them half the time and b) also do that accent.
I had to stop at 3 mins. The second hand cringe at these accents. I don't have the strongest Irish accent as I'm from the north of Ireland but even still these fake accents are hard to bare
Which irish accent is meant to be the sexiest because I know it's not my tallaght accent
I actually understood the cork lads! Sounds like my family :)
@0:28 he knew not to say anything bout Australia lol Btw keep it up jacko
I witnessed these crazy accents myself. I am an American who travelled to the Kerry peninsula several years ago. I went to a pub one night and had a man walk up to me and start talking. I couldn’t understand a word he said, asked him to repeat himself twice and still didn’t catch a single word. Told him sorry I couldn’t understand him and he walked away. That accent  blew me away.
You'd be better off hiring some fellas from boston than have christopher walken do an irish accent.
the second one was just Seamus  Finnigan
You think that farmer is hard to understand, listen to an old yorkshireman speaking Tyke. I speak broad yorkshire and even I can't understand a word.
YES THE MOST SEXIEST GANG
Funny enough, as someone who's been attempting more of a Northern Irish accent (being told from a couple of Irish natives), yes, Jack, you are a good barometer for the 10:00 section
2:18 best Walken impression I've ever heard!!!!! LMFAO I'm dying!!!
I wonder if justaminx is from county cork. Her accent sounds like that
We have this here in the USA with like people from the really really really Deep South. Like Virginia North and South Carolina or anywhere in Georgia but Atlanta. You just can’t understand some of those people. And the crazy part is when I lived in Florida they made fun of my accent.
05:05 he sounds like he is speaking gaelic
FROSTBUTT
Sean: Irish people don’t say “top of the mornin to yeah” Sean’s Intro: 🏃🏽‍♀️
2:26 Jack sounded like he was trying, and failing, to do an Arnold Schwarzenegger impersonation
Listening to some of these. Makes me desire to travel to new Zealand with a mad Russia with a staff, a blonde Norwegians archer, a couple of East Timos midgets, and an old small southern Irish ginger with an axe to throw a ring into a volcano.
Kerry is easily the best county in Ireland
Did he say... Farty-five ?
Idk what website said that Irish accents are the sexiest, I’ve never heard that before
hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhherb.
Sgt ducky has some pretty funny videos about irish accents, if you don’t mind a little swearing
Could understand the farmers but I could understand the Olympic winners
This is literally the type of stuff they make us listen during listening exams at school  Im just a simple non native English speaker, i didnt ask for such kind of torture during class😔
He still doesnt translate properly everything that the toothless farmer says.
Were they actually speaking English, or Gaelic?
I miss top of the mornin to ya intro
I wish I was Irish so I can understand this lol.
sure im from dublin but i live in cork and he didnt really master the cork accent
You know Brad was faking it, it was good but yano it was fake
When I saw this title the first thing that came to my mind "Donegal" everyone in Ireland will tell you Donegal is the worst accent to understand
Jamaican accents can be crazy too
12:20 TRUTH they are just joking at you gyse don't listen to this lady
6:52 it s funny ascent that reminder me with the Berbers in North Africa they had funny language
2:45 maybe the actor's are simply not Irish people
I wonder how someone with a super thick Kerry accent and a super thick southern US accent would interact.
Irish Dundee: "That's nor a knoife! THIS be a KNOIFE!
I don't like Jack, but I love Oirlund.
I wish I had a Irish accent
The man with the sheep sounds like he has a thick Irish accent and a thick Danish accent at the same time. Btw, Brad Pitt isn't really supposed to sound Irish in Snatch, you're simply not supposed to understand a word he's saying lol.
Mornin' lad
Jack: Irish people don't say top of the morning to ya  Also jack every video: TOPATHEMOTNINTOYA MY NAME IS JACKSEPTICEYE!
6:34 LOL, exactly! It made me think of that scene from Hot Fuzz when you started translating.
I can't believe I actually can understand old mate Mike
Lol you should try to translate thick hillbilly accents next
Americans are hilarious when it comes to accents. I'm from Canada and I just roll eyes when they go on about how we say, well, "about" r "aboot". Lol. They lay it on so thick. Like you said, it depends on the area a person is form. There's different dialects. All fun and games till they get all weird about poutine. Sometimes, it seems they're the least self aware country when it comes to how the rest of the world actually sees them. Kind of fantastic. Lol. That surfer accent, or jersey accent etc. Like Jack from titanic, "I'm king of the world!!!" Lol. Bless that mess.
the best time to have the food of greatness and of the f***ing time so you can have a food of italy also have a great food meating of meat and sausage lumps to have the best of uses to eat the time for rools
Ah , to be Irish and smack some horses
I swear that “schoolboy” has two mortgages and regularly goes to doctor for his back pain.
10/10 For your Christopher Walken accent
They cant use irish actors because irish people cant act it's all genuine
Jack's accent is really strong when he's talking to other Irish people or about Irish people or when he talks about Ireland.
I just wanna hear Sean try and comprehend a really thick wisconsin accent.
You should react to ”young offenders”
Even me, the most American dude in the world is embarrassed by the actor’s accents in wild mountain thyme
i would love to see jack talk about derry girls at some point that'd be so great
“Brad Pitt, you’re lucky you’re gorgeous” 😂
He beard likes like he had glh if you remember what that is
I can actually understand those sheep farmers but I also have a ton of family who live/come from Co. Kerry and visit often XDD
When an english speaker needs an english translator for the other english speaker.
The rowers literally don't look like their mouths are moving
I actually could understand them somewhat, if I focused. As an American with Irish heritage, I’m proud to say I can understand them
The fact that the Limerick accent was just an impression of BlindBoy doing his stereotipicical Limerick accent was great
HEY HEY WHY DON'T YOU TAKE A LOOK AT YOUR OWN CHANNEL HAHAHAHAHAH
That guy with the sheeps, I literally didnt understand a single word
fun fact: im irish and my english teacher used the Wild Mountain Thyme trailor as an example of uneducated stereotypes and bad writing, and made us all right and how bad it was for homework. It was not a difficult task  edit: im aware of the spelling error, never said i was good at english!
Thy all awesome an I giggles me we laddie
The Irish accent is 100% not the most attractive
Oh shit I’m 6th most sexiest
“And I don’t sound like that. And if I do… I’m so sorry”  Right, who’s gonna tell him?
The movie att he start sounds more like australian
at first i thought he was speaking gaeilge
lived in ireland all my life and i couldn't for the life of me understand that farmer
Farty-five  I'm convinced scottish and heavy irish just learned to talk without moving their lower jaw
"Every town has a different accent" Wait till they realise, there's *two* accents per town, cultie and townie
I mean I'm Mexican and sometimes I don't understand other Mexicans.
Irish is the free form jazz of language
I don't like that chart I think scotlands second
omg this quickly turned into america-cringe. I wasnt prepared for that. It hurt my brain a bit.
People from Ireland actually speak Irit
Irish people = Built Different!
Im here because I'm watching the series "Time" with Sean Bean & I can't understand the lads. So painful when a great show has dialogue sounds like globerly skindillicky blatbihga Dootarthy flunterpully sploop
I've noticed that most epic fantasies like G.O.T & L.O.T.R's all use an Irish accent.
I decided to watch this again with closed captioning on. Oh my God
Dang this was a good video
Wait yo I have a question lol. What’s up with an “Americanized” Accent so to speak? I’m from the US of course but I’m curious about the accent thing. So let’s say for example, if I get an girlfriend from Italy and ask her if she wants to live in the US with me, would she keep her accent? I know that immigrants per se lose their accent when they come here to the US young(like Guava Juice) put if she’s like 21 and above, how will that play out? In general, I’m curious about accents and how they work!
The sheep farmer was the best, that accent is so pretty!!! 😄
I love how the rowers are giving an “interveiw”
Guys guys how do you say mirror? 😂
I have an Irish accent
Thyme as in the hhhhherb
Ngl Brad Pitt sounds a bit like he's speaking Simlish with an Irish accent impression lmao
Damn we're weird.
Lol why would they not just get Irish actors
Dude, as a non native English speaker this is just straight up listening to Sims talk at this point.
Disenchanted might sound irish
We did a test in understanding other irish accents it was rly suprising one none of us could understand
I’m not even gonna lie, I sometimes can’t even understand British accents so I’m like 😀❓ during this LOL
Most of them aren’t even thick they just have speech impedaments.
2:20 An Irishman does a better Christopher Walken impression than Christopher Walken can do of an Irishman.
That old guy sounds like he's speaking a different language
I listened to Jack translate it, and then listened to it again. and I STILL could not understand.
That was a good Christopher Walken  impression!
Wild mountain thyme.... Utter shite
10:45 sean triggerd a bit xD
Jack's Christopher Walken accent is on point
I'd always heard the brad pit accent was a from a very specific place in England not a typical Irish accent(even though there's no such thing as typical irish)
omg your Irish
I’m irish watching this video and laughing my head off. By the way what jack is saying is right, what he’s laughing at is indeed a laughable attempt at the accent.
Irish mirror. MirrrRrrrrr
at least sean didnt talk shit about the aussie accent
I want a part 2 pls.
Omg this is amazing 😂😂😂 I'm in stitches hahaha!   Sean, can you please do a callab with Call me Kevin and watch Irish news  please? He also did a video on the lost sheep 🤣 it's so much more interesting than Australian news 😅 well we are 5th on the sexiest accent list I might add but gotta love Irish news 😆
My brain threw away any hopes of understanding math just so it could understand that farmer's accent after about 1 and half minutes of listening to it. I've resigned myself to being stuck with the accent for a few hours now lol (at least I like it)
👎 this is the Dislike button. It's used on YouTube to voice a dislike in the video. YouTube is trying to remove this visible statistic to shut down your opinion. This is a protest. Copy and paste it to every YouTube video you can.
jack says"farty five, thats a lot of sheep"
Is this the Irish version of Boomhauer?
11:40 I’m from the Midwest. It isn’t “mirror” it’s “meer”
My accent 7th
So, Irish accents are so bad that even Irish people think they sound funny
Dia duit conas ata tu?.
The part of Ireland that was the "Crown of the Irish accent" should be called the Jeff Boomhauer of Ireland
i didnt even notice when the guy wet quiet and jack toke over XD the sounds blended AT 19:06
being irish  is one thing , but capturing this nebulas irish accent is as impossible as catching a leps
this is the most no true Scotsmens i have ever  seen xD ♥
Jacks how sick
Sean seriously you couldn't understand him
Why wouldn't you get orish actors to read through the script and imitate it
Irish news is the superior news.
The rowers weren't that hard to understand.
Some of these sounds like how Minx sounds when she gets mad.
The very first video I ever watched of Jacksepticeye I thought he was trying to be quirky by impersonating an Irish accent 🙈😂
I know everyone already pointed this out a million times, but I just love how Jack’s accent gets stronger the more he listens to his fellow brethren.
I’m Irish and I don’t get it- well kinda cause I’m part Scottish I live in Ireland and my mum is Irish and my dad is Scottish these were sus
Jack can do a better Christopher Walken accent then Christopher Walken can do an Irish accent. They should make a movie about Christopher Walken and cast Jack as him.
sounds like people talking in the deep south of the us sometimes
i find scottish accents to be extremely attractive. irish accents just make everything seem funny.
I can't believe he didn't understand the rubberbandits reference
man that accent is brutal. i got a few words here and there, but not much. doesnt even sound like english lol
You sure that’s not korean?
My boyfriend is originally from Dublin and he's yet to show me his accent lol he says I have to wait till we meet in person lol I absolutely looove Irish accents, they're so nice and exciting
your board in the back round...........  I don't know. It was acting pretty sus lately.
American accents are always either Texan or Brooklyn/Bronx. According to Europe those are our only available accents. Farmer or mob boss are our only career choices..
Honestly, the best source of learning an Irish accent I’ve found so far has been those “Accent Tag” videos. Makes it a lot easier to hear what specific consonants and vowels are pronounced as, along with some small bit of general vocabulary.  The “th” sounds stood out to me the most in those videos. “Th” at the end of the word tends to be shortened to just “t” and “th” in the middle of a word seems to fall somewhere between a “t” and a “d.”  Also, a lot of people try to put the stereotypical lilt in the wrong part of the sentence. It’s usually just at the end of the sentence, occasionally at the beginning but in a more subtle way.  Just an outsider’s perspective. :)
If Sean Connery can be a Russian sub captain of Lithuanian birth with a thick Scottish brogue, then Christopher “Gimme More Cowbell” Walken can do what he likes
It's funny how Jack said that the way Irish people say mirror is just MI and a lot of r's and that's how its said in the Appalachian region most likely because the deeper into the mountains the more likely you are to meet people of Irish descent when they immigrated over there because of coal.
I'm Welsh and I can't even understand him
What?!? People don't say "top of the morning" in Ireland??? But.... But.... Minecraft 🤔😱
The greatest accent is YORKSHIRE!... specifically the Calderdale accent! (Think 'Happy Valley', they had some locals in it, as it was filmed down road. XD)  And my Irish accent, (lol) always starts with "Da ting, wi da ting, wi da ting!" cos I used to live with a woman who came from err... which ever part she was from, and she said this to me one day, I loled, I'd just asked "Bu, do ya wan' owt down shop?"...
ive watched this video like 3 times now.
5:05 the guy lost mas soon as he spoke, i think im fairly good at understanding accents, but that is such a heavy accent
5:20 and onward, i could understand it, barely
fARTY FIVE SHEEP
in the video irish farmers lose their sheep mad accent I didn't even realize that they were speaking english
Funnily enough Brad Pitt's accent came through pretty clearly for me, it sounded more Newfie to me than Irish.
If you didnt spend this entire video talking outloud in an Irish accent then you crazy.
2:21 did i just hear arnold schwarzenegger
What county are you from jack?
When I saw the minx and jack talking in “strong” Irish accents I don’t understand how people don’t understand them, it sounds like English to me, maybe it’s because I’m half Irish? Idk I don’t count myself as Irish I’ve just been to the country a lot during my life mostly to a suburb of Dublin where my mum was born/where my grandparents live. But I have been to cork and Belfast (if you count Northern Ireland as part of the country.) I can only understand the REALLY strong accents a bit
heheh he stopped at the aussies
i loved this video exesivly
I think it may be my distant Irish ancestry because the more I drink the more I understand the people. The booze unlocks my Irish genetics!!!
You know what’s the worst accent? American accent with Russian language, no seriously, every time when someone’s says: Oh you’re Russian? What does these Russian guys in Avengers speak? I can’t tell, because everything I hear is ubludokmattvouanuidisudatiresilkomnelezttigovnosobacyemattvoutrahnutebaivsutvousemyu
ok but is the guy in the sheep video speaking English because I'm genuinely confused
…
Burst out laughing at the vowel bender
5:00 well then find me after them that's right then you own them. possible at night that'd be a full moon that i was liking and should have been bright out in the could anyone go up in the mountains of that was 55 sheep missing like in the lamps and wasn't in the shape just can't count out a nice bit too many like can be done about you nothing
5:40 that accent's so heavy it has it's own gravitational pull
Absolutely love hearing various accents from everywhere- especially at work (We've had people from Germany, Russia, China, Spain, etc). As an Asian American who learned German for four years and adore eastern European and British accents, I tend to understand a lot of different people (actual east African accents I'm still trying to learn to hear through- we've had some of those customers, and Indian accents I'm good with until a certain point, mostly because a good majority of my classmates in my magnet schools were Indian) and it's lovely being able to pinpoint certain accents and telling them that how they speak is absolutely beautiful. I love being able to tell people that how they speak is amazing and seeing them smile.  Beauty of working at a bookstore lol
im irish and ive no clue what that farmer was saying it sounds like hes speaking giberish
farty five
The farmer sounds like my grandpa
Heavy irish accent is to english what catalan is to spanish, it should be considered another language
One thing us Scottish have in common with the Irish is that some words will drop some letters and others will switch letters.
0:39 XD aparently im a child who needs to go to bed because I was thinking: gotoyourchannelhaha
I vote you should be on the Try Channel.
Part 2
Mad accent all I heard, sheep, sheep, lost sheep lol
"Get fucked italy" Smiles in italo-irish
JACK WHY DID YOU SKIP THE NORTHERN IRISH SECTION OF THE LAST VIDEO? :( we're Irish too
Ha ha ha the school kid was like the Canadian of Irish accents 🤣🤣🤣
That deep irish accent... did not understand any of that
I needed a laugh 😆✅
the 1st video is like english trying hard to be irish. 😅😅😅😅
Stop stealing other people’s likes
Russian is the sexiest.
every one in Ireland is like siblings or friends just making fun of each others accents
My Irish accent is non-existent.  Minored in theatre and my acting coach made me try one.  Yeah...that was fun.
It'd be quite a different story if they made an African movie with non-African actors speaking without an African accent
It's the second time I've watched this video and I still lost it when the animated dude started doing the Cork accent
I have a Northern Ireland accent and it’s literally the ugliest fucking thing. Like when I’m in Belfast (where I’m from) everyone speaks really stupid, and then when I go down south the accents just elevate in every way.  Edit: the Irish school boy with “frostbit” is a northern accent to give yous an idea of how shit it is lmao
Omg the lad from limerick in the video was the rubber bandits! Jack should definitely react to their music videos
Just like in the United States the California accent is way different than the New York or Tennessee accents.
0:26 I have a french accent.... Oh well... "Takes a big fat dump and eats it"
the fact i can understand kerry sheep man as a person from limerick city is amazing to me
I know what thyme is D'anam don gel  Jk    Edited:I mispelled diabha
midlands
once jack  translated the first part i understood the rest of what he said
Jack I've just started watching some of your content and I love the Irish accents, I also follow Justine Stafford of Nobber and she hides her accent all the time but once in a while it comes out and it's just feckin awesome.  Oh my lord I wish she would let it rip a little more but I think it's due to her career goals lol.  Thanks for the fun Jon
Uhh dude that’s what Irish travelers sound like. Just look up any video of Irish travelers on YouTube.
When you just think the sheep guy has an understandable accent :p
Lol so much of this just made me think of Daithi :P
I'm american but I come from Irish descent.  I could understand a lot of the dialogue in some of those clips.  Not ALL of it (like the sheep herder), but a lot of it.  I know that heritage has nothing to do with understanding an Irish accent, but I'm unironically going to buy a DNA test to see just how Irish I am after watching this LOL.
Jack, an Irish youtuber: "I'm doing great at this!"
Can’t lie I’ve watched jack for so long I can’t even hear the accent anymore 🤣and bc of jack I can full understand the Irish
My friend is from Cork but she sounds like British and Australian more than Irish idf get it
Title: Bad IRISH ACCENTS That Even I Can't Understand  Jack: Proceeds to understand everything perfectly
That Irish schoolboy sounds like how I speak when I go on a rant. Oh well
I'm from Cork and i can understand the strong Cork accents perfectly well  Welp-
Fell out of my chair so hard the dog jumped 3 feet in the air..... bahahahahahaha!!!!
1:04 he just sounds like Santa. --or what we have been taught is Santa.
At least jack didn't turn up like the old farmer guy because I'd be watching jackseptic goblygook
purple burglar alarm
I'm dating an Irish boy right now and the first time I heard him say "tree" and "tings" I was baffled because I thought it was all just accent jokes people made, like how people say "chewsday"
Mirror in a scottish accent is also mirrrr
I love your infectious happiness!  Gave me a good grin. Being a northern US/Canada boy I have had a fair few 'fargo' accent clips sent my way and have a similar fun time looking at them.  That accent is not common AT ALL around anywhere I have lived, (and not common at all in Fargo either), but there are for sure bits of it that many northerners (North America) have.
Brad Pitt nailed it a good amount but sounded a but drunk but at the same time most Irish are lol.
that how to do sounds more Dublin to me
U are so genuinely funny my friend! Great content! 🤣
is breá liom ireland  Please tell me if I did that right
I'm fine with 3rd, love you Ireland 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🤝🇮🇪
This video is the reason Zane is Borderlands best character
That movies got 5.7 out off 10 stars on IMDb. 😆
I can’t understand a word of it starting to wonder if my grandfather actually was Irish my aunt has a theory that he stole someone else’s ID before he joined ww2 . he was a prisoner of war at treblinka she gave me his gas mask a few months ago and his boat tickets to Canada after the camp was liberated the name on his ID was mckendrick but he had family in Canada already who’s last was was Rice
Who lives in Ireland Me
It sounds Scottish
Just thank you for being alive at the same time as me and making awesome content ❤✌
I could understand some of the incomprehensible stuff. Some of it. Mainly from the 2nd and 3rd strong accents… Neat.
I LOVE Snatch! Awesome movie!
The Limerick one is very exact 😂😂😂
watching this almost a year later makes me think of a "Midlands" accent (in England) none of them match! You can be half a mile away and speak in an entirely differently way, thanks Sean was a real boost on a day when I wasn't feeling so good!
I’ve been given the roll of an Irish character in my village panto and I CANT DO IT ISTG
Anyone else Irish here? Aon duine eile atá Éireannach anseo?
Is the farmer not talking in irish, not english with an accent, irish the language
The old dude sounds like he’s switching between English and Gaelic but it’s just his accent
I'm a vowelbender lmaaaoo 11:15
So happy this just got recommended to me I’m laughing so hard rn
simlish irl
Jacksepticeye doing an impression of someone doing an impression of Jacksepticeye. 7:43  And... I dunno about you, but it sounded exactly like Jacksepticeye.
I think the vocal couches are just trying to get you to a point where you can convince an audience, say for a movie role, in a short amount of time that the character you are playing is from Ireland. Without having been born and spent your life growing up there it would be very difficult if not impossible to actually convince someone who has, but it comes off well enough to convince the other 99% of the world who didn't and have never been.
Jack you have a very happy voice not a sign oh anger in there
Jack, your Christopher Walken is better than Christopher Walken being Irish lol
"Eat shit france"  -Jack, 2020
Hey Man!! You just turned into my favorite Irish person. I was laughing with tears with you all video!!
My Uncle had the thickest Irish accent, coupled with his myotonic dystrophy, couldn’t understand a word he said
8:30 frostbutt
i can always give it up to hollywood to use americans actors instead of getting an actor from said country, lbut theyve gotten a lot better now
I’m Irish and can’t understand the farmer
Bruh that guy is talking enchantment table
At 5:36 the dude with the god-awful accent I understood something about a night shirt.
What the fuck was Brad Pitt saying? I read the subtitles and I still have no fucking idea.
I prefer most scottish accent cuz they're impossible to understand. Just get plastered with them and they'll talk like aliens weirdly enough the 1 scottish guy i met in singapore was an anime fan went to a convention. He can't understand singaporean accents and singaporeans can't understand him as well so he's begging for help in the airport while getting plastered almost got thrown and me understanding a ton of accent because thanks to the good ole trainspotting movie I managed to get him to his designated hotel and met with his mates from australia played some Smash and got plastered again.
This was hilarious, I'd love to see more!!
"They don't sound Irish at all!"  Hopefully excluding actually Irish Jamie Dornan, lol.
Loved it was pretty funny
Jack does a better Christipher walkin than Christipher walkin
One of the best videos ever XD
I would LOVE to see Jack react to the IRISH TALE
I loved this!!! I love accents and to hear the different ones!!
That sheep Farmer Video...I Literatur felt like I was listening to a Drunk alien befire sean translated the words🤣
Accents so thick they might as well be speaking a whole different language.
And start drinking more Guinness and Jameson Irish Whiskey!!!☘️🍀🍺🥃
RT game, County Louth accent? 🤣🤣😂
Jack you have, to me, a very light irish accent unless you start talking with a thicker accent which you sure can do. But for me who is pretty good at talking with different accent but yours is hard to talk like. I have easier to speak with very thick accent then some lighter ones.
Dang, no one says "top of the mornin' to ya ladies!" In Ireland? I would just imagine a bunch of Irishmen having a sleepover and when the first one wakes up in the morning they scream "TOP OF THE MORNIN' TO YA LADIES!"      Just wanna make this clear... this is a joke.
"Drink more milk bitch"  Me: ....I'm trying so hard jack..to not drink milk because I am sick...why...you make me want to drink milk now 😭😭
Farty five sheep lol
You do a better Christopher Walken accent than Christopher Walken an Irish accent lol
I am scottish and I think the Irish accent is thee best accent EVER I absolutely love it! If I didn't love Scotland so much I would move to Ireland forever!
Irish accents are the BEST. EVER. If you ever go to Montana, we have a weird accent. A blend of the Dakota's with a hint of Scandinavian influences. Butte is also a very Irish town. Come on down and have some fun!!
7:55 jack you do sound like that no shame tho
When I was younger I had the thickest Dublin accent ever. My dad's Irish but he had a Wicklow accent. We had no idea where it came from but now it's nonexistent. I can't do the accent anymore! It's so sad
i have lisitned that irish people are famous for drinking so i think every irish person is so drunk that when they are sober they sound like they are are drunk
Turn on CC (Closed Caption) , google can even understand what this guy cant.
This makes me think of the east coast of Canada; it’s such a strong and specific dialect haha I’m on the west coast and I can’t understand a (far East) Newfie..😅😅
I love that Blindboy is the specific Limerick reference. His podcast is an entire experience.
The rower: *speaking in tongues* Jack: HAHAHA WHAT A LEGEND!!  Me: ...
Mi Nan was Irish with the T accent  & Grandad Yorkshire, I say a lot of T sound's ont mi words.. Thing becomes Ting, Three becomes Tree & Tree sounds like Trrree, used to drive an old ex uf mine crazy,,, As ya do!!
No one can out Irish Jacksepticeye
I’m Irish too we can work together to decode this together
Me English
I love Irish accents they are amazing, but yours is the best.
I'm irish
Clearly the deaf community trolled this poll.
Can you do an entire episode with an American accent? That I want to see.
8:07 - young Gman
‘Start drinkin’ more milk, bitch’ needs to be a shirt.
Dublin... reminds of that asshole from Bioshock
I never thought that Brad Pitt was meant to be doing an Irish accent, it was a "Traveler" accent, meant to be a mongrel combo of different dialects.
This was hilarious 😂
The guy who lost sum sheep is speaking doctor’s handwriting.
Jack translating the hard to understand Irishmen is like me being from Texas and able to understand Boomhauer from King of the Hill.
should have gone through foil arms and hog
Feck me and i thought our accent was harsh lmao
(●__●) trying my best to understand
HmMmm
The Irish accent is basically just holding your tongue in the R position.
I'm like "man Irish people are funny" then I realized I'm Irish also
These are Sims.
Is this the sexiest accent in english? Sexier than italian or french?
My moms side is irish I have always loved Irish people best in the world.
I want to see Jack become an actor and blow up in the movie industry
Jack now understands why I cringe every time some hollywood actor tries a southern accent
I'm a Newfoundlander & I can understand this perfectly LOLOL
YOU HAVENT HEARD SEXY TILL YOU HEARD THE WELSH
looses my shit
1:04 “Welcome to Ireland.” *Bird squawks at the camera*
Hey Jack, say "Girard the guard kicked me hard in the nards"
you know its bad when you can talk english and jackcepticeye has to translate english for you anyways.
What part of Ireland is Jack from?
whaddan done abot it? nottin
Cool
The majestic satin laterally blot because animal nouzilly bury apropos a majestic divorced. spiky, reflective bridge
Never been to Ireland, but I like leather jacket guy. He’s funny and actually perpetuates stereotypes. On second thought, that’s probably not what you want to hear.
im living in donegal (ireland) and the sheep farmer I could barley understand
As a Welsh person, I can understand some of the third clip and fourth
Only irish people understand the pain of brad fucking pitt being irish
I thought if you couldn't understand an Irish accent it was good?
How the fuck is an Irish accent sexy? The only way it’s sexy is if I can’t understand your talking at all
Burst a bloodvessel laughing at the Christopher Walken accent.
I speak Irish
Even tho this isn't the same thing, it cracks me up to hear actors do horrible southern accents cuz I'm from North Carolina surrounded by southern accents every day and it's hilarious
Not gonna lie I wonder how he would react to Zane's accent in borderlands 3
my great granny is from ireland and so is my great grandad, their from up north in donegal, the harkin family
I AM IRISH {FROM CORK } EVERYONE NOT FROM CORK TELL ME TO SLOW THE FUC  DOWN WHEN I TALK
Awww, I wanted Sean to insult Australia. I live and am Australian, so it would've been fun.
Mind you I hate people taking the mick out of my accent too.
Jacksepticeye: "The Irish accent is an elusive thing" Me: "It's not as elusive as my West Country accent although they sound almost exactly the same, as well as North American/Canadian accents sounding pretty similar."
Jamie Dornan did a shite job in jadotdville
at this point its like hearing proper englinsh in america compared to straight slang in america theyre still spraking english it just seems like mumbling because thats what we're used tto it
But our Irish Overlord I'm lactose intolerant lmfao challenge accepted lol
"whenever we say 'that woman' we say 'that one' I don't know why" I do, Sean, because it's not 'one' it's 'bhean' (which means 'woman' in irish)
btw I love to go into the garden to pick some fleirs
That's how I feel about my Boston accent.
Irish accents and aussie accents are so hard to mimic well
Really be speaking Simlish out here.
I want more of this video
Farmers accent was so strong sounded like he was speaking Dutch
im learning irish but damb do i want to be irish.
HEY! I'm Christopher walkin' here!!
As a Kildare man we have a flat accent
This is like americans speaking british
I'm Irish from wicklow we don't have a bad accent but this is can't understand
Please do like 5 more of these
When you translated my jaw went to the floor. I didn't think somebody so understandable could understand somebody so *un*-understandable
the school guy sounds like he is from the shire in lord of the rings
Isn't Emily Blunt British?
To be honest when it comes to good Irish accents James Frecheville in Black 47 is the first thing that comes to mind considering that he is Australian. Not only that but he spoke better Irish than I can
Man you have so see Scottish man stuck on a roof
“I don’t sound like that and if I do I’m so sorry”
do people find the guys at 9:10 hard to understand? every cork person sounds like that and its so easy for me to understand
please tell me im not the only person who can understand most of what they are saying
i have been around so many international ppl that unless accents are brought up (or someone accent is really thick and hard for me to understand) I just disregard accents and don't even try to place them (partly bc im so bad at it).
Alwways thought Scottish and Irish accents sounded similar, but it’s weird because I can easily do a Scottish accent but not an Irish one
v txf hfc          fdbbfb
My dad is Northern Irish ( I am half) sadley I don't have the accent but it's weird as people say they hear it :/
My friend is Irish but she and her family are losing their accents maybe because they live in Canada where they’re aren’t many people with Irish accents
Yer man with the spar plastic bag on his head is meant to be one of the lads from "The Rubber Bandits" a Limerick commedy duo ya gowl !!!!
No I can understand you but some of these I can't 😂😂 but I love it
I’m from COUNTY KERRY

UP THE KINGDOM 🇮🇪🇮🇪🇮🇪
my dad's side is irish and from belfast and lemme tell ya the norn iron accent is....somethin
I just want to hear Christopher Walken say "Faith and Begorah"
When your irish accent is so thick you sound german
After you translated what those farmers were saying. I think I lost my shit. I live in Northeast Ohio were we sound like the american national news broadcasters. But, if I hears someone from the south, I can't barely translate the crap they say. So good on you man, that was impressive.
I can understand 5:33 - 5:38 really clear, the other stuff is tricky.
2:20 why did he turn into Gru there 😂🤚🏻
its weird, I can understand pieces of the sentences but in between its just gibberish lmao
dreadfull
accent is so heavy it sounds german.
Scotts are better tbh
If you grew up in kerry, would an english / american accent sound strong to you? would you have trouble understanding what theyre saying or would the annunciation make it easy?
You should react to Alan from jurasic park playing an irish inspector in Peaky blinders👍 (i know it's Sam Neill btw)
I'll = oil
8:26 that’s from the north for sure
No bc all I hear is jibberish.
Just watched Charlie cox do a savage Dublin accent in Kin and that somehow led me here 😂😁
Im Irish and even I found it hard to understand
for anybody that cares, the frostbit guy was faking the accent to make his friends laugh, but he was in the news again twice recently. He went missing in the sea for a fair few hours and was found out at sea swimming with dolphins, he then went to the middle east on holiday literally the next week and got bit by a shark
ayyyy australian is #5 on the sexy accent. love it mate
Wait! He said it again! 10/05/17 "I'm in the game...  " TOPOTHEMORNIN2YEH!!!"
He says the Irish never actually say it, but if you look at his video "something doesn't feel right / duck season #1(VR), at exactly 6:00 he says "TOPOTHEMORNIN2YEH!!!"😁
This reminds me of that one guy from brave... except he was Scottish.
I am half Irish no accent but this is so funny
Can you please do this again because my narrow minded ass had no clue yall had that many accents, also I spit beer up watching
so this is kinda what it's like when people try to decipher a heavy Southern accent when i'm just used to it
The funniest movie ever the freaking dog it's the diamond and then this guy doesn't die after being like 50 times
20:45 on...... Amen!
Around 12:15 to 12:30: I totally agree..... I worked in NI for 3 yrs  and could tell difference between Down vs. Antrim eg. Less than 30 miles apart FGS!!
Your man who lost the sheep just sounds like the average person from Beara or anywhere along the Cork and Kerry border sure he's fierce easy to understand.
skill issue
Guess my surname? 🤔
yo is that a mirrur?
Fellow Irish person but im from the north so i dont have an accent🇮🇪
have you heard bad AUSSIE accents? if your australian i suggest to search some up if you want a laugh.
Christopher walkin doesn't do a good American accent either lol
when that lady said Oil and he said I'll and they sounded the same i lost it lol.
Talesin can do better Irish accents than the people in “wild mountain thyme” …….. I’m sorry………..
Farty five🤣🤣🤣
My aunt Niamh has an amazing deep Irish accent it’s amazing
I vote for jacksepticeye as the sexiest Irish accent!
Disclaimer: I do not pretend to know the language or accents very well I believe I have an answer to why they refer to "your woman" as "your wan" Taking Duolingo lessons, I believe it comes from the word for "lady". Bhantierna. The "bh" here makes that W sound, so it's more like WAN-Teer-Nuh. Of course, Duo has gone on to say that their Irish lessons are far from perfect or complete, and it is in beta as a course, so any connections I make could be completely wrong.
The hottest accent for me is probably Australian
Oh my god! None of that was Irish. It was either English or gibberish. I know because half my family are Irish. Because of how inaccurate it was, it was hilarious.
19:47 the dude with a spar bag is actually a real person from ireland loool
“Go back to bed child and start drinking more milk bitch” had me rolling on the floor🤣🤣

You actually do say Oi instead of I, Shawn.
Brad Pitt in snatch was spot on. He’s acting an Irish traveller in England, which sounds nothing like the typical Irish accent
Yeah I'm from the southern U.S., and sometimes I can't even understand country accents, I can totally believe this
I’m half Irish so I sound a bit irish
I love Irish...
No you do not sound pubescent
He speaks the way I write
I can confirm that those rowing boys are definitely from cork😂
Brad Pitt sounds like he hung out with only the most rural of irishmen to copy their dialect but he was there for too long and lost some of his actual english
Snatch is my dads all time fave movie every time he sees its on he will watch it
The old guy said “you just have to know what the f#*k you’re doing” 👍
they didn't pay attention to christopher's accent, they just wanted him in the film
Why is it always the southern region of countries with the weird accents (Germany has Bavaria, USA has Texas and Ireland has... well... South Ireland)
holy shoot is that jason statham in snatch
In Canada I frequently hear: "Oh! You're Irish! Diddly Dee Potaetooos, right?" And it drives me bonkers.
the girl listening to pick up lines in an Irish accent was down HORRENDOUS
Conas  ata tú
how the fuck can jack translate, i understand hes irish but by jesus
These accents are so funny, (im a little irish myself so heh
*intro
i am a 10 year old but that into sill hurts
i down a swig of wisky
I tried to say garden and park in an actual Irish accent but ended up just saying gairdín and páirc
My granddad if from Limerick I want to go there in the future
Thank god subtitles are on 👀
I'm Irish
I’m not very Irish, but I get an accent if I get really angry for some reason
Pitt was a gypsy though. He wasn't going for a full irish accent. They said they were going for a mix of irish and english accents.
The sheep farmer. Hes the irish godpidgeon
You did a great Walken impression 😄 👏
Me watching this when im irish:
i could understand brad and the schoolboy, but them farmers were like aliens who learned english from jpop lyrics...
I really don't have a hard time understanding these... Am I the weird one?? The only one that was difficult for me was the very first old man
i'm actually concerned how the man lost so many sheep
snatch is one of my all time favs, and i didin't think brad was too awful at it
I like the irish accent i also like the Scottish and England accent
?
The true spice of the world stew
The strong Irish accents are swole.
I wonder if Jack has seen that video of the bat loose in the house.
I didn't know that the Irish used "b'y's" like us Newfoundlanders do! Newfoundlander's is basically Canadian Irishmen.  I understood most of that without the translations- really not far off from a hard Newfie accent!  Would be cool to see Sean react to some Newfoundland accents haha!
Brad Pitt is Brad Pitt. Just perfect
I hate to go there but the Irish people just sound like they're drunk. Like if I was drunk I think I'd be able to understand exactly what was being said. I'm an American southerner so the accents (slack jaw) get pretty thick here as well. Some of these Irish people sound like my grandpa when he was sauced.
Where's the line between having an accent and speaking Gaelic?

Filipino accent: Finally a worthy opponent, our battle will be legendary
When you think you can understand english. Irish Farmer: 🤨
Jacksepticeye be like: fuk you drink more milk freaking big man baby. :me behind my computer:😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂man baby wtf😂
I know it's not funny but I feel that an impostor is there in Kerry... 😅
I basically love this video whith Mikey etc 🤣 any kind of English isn't my native so I love watch this cuz one day if I will understand it I will be sure that I on natives level 🤣
Not sure why someone would ask you to say something when they could just hear you say it to a camera here
Laughes in irish
I'm American, I say I don't have an accent until I get mad and on certain words.
His FACE when he heard the speech coach was American 🤣
No luck for Scottish!
I love Irish accents cause it’s like trying to decode a puzzle, lol.

I'm from Eastern Europe and I now live in Ireland in Kerry and I still don't understand what people say LOL

ROFLOA You think your accent is bad. Try being deep south southern.. Everyone laughs at my voice on my video's lol.. So trust me.. You've got it good.. HAHA
I'M AUSTRALIAN HOW DO I ACTUALLY KNOW WHAT HE'S SAYING
The accent is so bad it sounds like  different language.
I'm from the north east of england, we have some pretty weird accents. I understood every word that Irish farmer said.
Seo libh,  cánaidh,  amhrán na bhFiann!
Where in Ireland are you from so we know how your accent was supposed to sound like ',:/
How could you hate an Irish accent

Random question but why is the **t** in the news casters name lower case but the best of his name is capitalized? 7:38
Why does the incomprehensible Irish sound like a Swedish accent???? 😂😂😂😂😂
Hearing jack mentioning skibbereen puts a smile on my face.
I don't know why, but i always ended up laughing when Sean cussed lol.
I went to cork to improve my English Hahaha omg I think I can understand all the accents 😅 around the 🌎
limerick accents are accurate
I need more fuel jack
“Are you gonna say flire and siure?”  “Flare” 😂
"I'm a Vowel Bender"  Idk why that made me laugh xD
Im using this to better my irish accent for a character- dear god
Love the channel and a qweer bit of talent you are by the way. the only reason I can think of for not liking you is their thick as a ditch....lol
mirrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
I no longer feel bad about how I talk. Growing up was always teased or corrected about how i talked. Thank you Sean
Jason Statham @3:14?
the southern irish is still by this day, for me, DEFINITELY the hardest english accent to understand.
Its freaky how Swedish some words sounds like, really get the relation between English and Swedish.
That sheep guy is so irish he's close to speaking Gaelic lol
that sheep fella is the reason you guys won sexiest accent for sure
😂 bro their so badddd
If you close your eyes you can’t tell when Jack stops talking and the video he’s watching stops.
This is aggravating
FFS why didn't they cast  actual Irish people
I remember me and my father visited Ireland in 2005, when I was 15. Man I had to translate everything for my Dad LOL. Somehow I understood even the drunkest of people there but my Dad was lost LOL.
😂😂😂 "I'm a vowel bender."
I was born in Newfoundland, which is an Irishman’s home away from home if you know where to go.
1:05 that bird has me WHEEZING OMFG WHY IS IT SO FUNNY
id rather listen to sheep stuff then politics tbh
Irish accents are indeed the most sexiest. ❤ It's one of the things that got me into Jacksepticeye. I'd be okay with a video of Jack telling stories.
Maybe the farmer is speaking Irish and has a mad Irish accent
0:27 You are now officially English
Now can people see why casting scarlet on every adaptation is quite the problem?
At the beginning of the video of was thinking of that movie that tom cruise was in because my teacher showed it in class and I thought the accents were a little off
that farmer- man if I were to speak with him I would think either me or him is having a stroke.  He was 90% incomprehensible. I only caught single words.  I think that would be the experience with time travel.
18:46 Scousers also replace “th” with “d”, so you here “dey do dah don’t dey?” Quite a lot
I would love to learn how to speak Irish from seán.
So irish try to talk without oppening their damn mouths?
Idk if it's me or like a American thing but  is the Irish accent just really hot? A lot of my friends think it's hot or just sexy or something idfk but I love the accent. It's one of the reasons I watch him. He is really funny though and I don't think I typed this right lol.
Northern Ireland all way
The accent in the trailer makes me cringe waaay 2 much
im scared... Why can't i hear Seans irish accent anymore?
The fact the “frostbit” lad was found down in kerry in water surrounded by a pod of dolphins there a few days ago 😭
I'm so confused... Is Jonathon Taylor Thomas' haircut from Home Improvement from 1994 getting popular again???
The county cork accent will never be beaten. Cork is elite.
that video where they had people blindfolded listening to irish accents, for northside dublin they should have gotten someone from ballymun or finglas, the accents they have are absolutely horrendous and hearing them is pain lmao of course there are a lot of people from ballymun and finglas etc who don't have that accent, including me, but if you're from dublin, you know what accent I'm talking about lol
That frostbit lad was found off the cost of kerry
HE NEED SOME MILK
You know it’s a thick accent when Sean has to translate English to English for us to understand
I'm kinda disappointed I didn't see a culchie carving up a bar of soap.
18:46 it’s like how we Cajuns in the Louisiana say this, that, these, those, but we sound more American.
I think i need to start off by saying... I watch your videos just because I adore your accent. I really love all Native Irish accents, even the ones i can't understand, and i hope one day i could go and visit! Thanks for blessing us with this video! <3
He’s not Christopher Talkings
Irish people learned to speak enchanting table
As an American Brit, I like laughing at the bad accents in movies. My favorite thing to do is translate the different dialects and accents and watch people get confused. It’s not hard. 🤣🤣
i think the woman was trying to do an northern irish accent but i have no idea?
The farmer sounds scouse accent to me
Seeing people trying to do an Irish accent is like someone trying to sound southern with strong T's.
*yea I'm a vowel bender*                                                THIS IS MY FAVOURITE THING ANYONE EVER SAID
I'm from the north, where is that on the list lol
that farmer never said shit about some one taking them. he just moved his mouth and made spit sounds for that part
In snatch there not trying to be irish
When you're irish but don't have a accent 😪
Everytime i hear the name emily blunt i think of emily sharp
Malk
Bip
it’s so funny how he has to translate it
Fookin, fuckin. FROSTBUTT IS WHAT I HEARD I LOVE IT XD
Love your accent! My grandson and I watch your channel all the time. You are a funny guy! MN USA
I would love Irish accent but all I hear is äölsadlfäls¨ågpSFÄSÖKLG, I just can't understand the words. XD  Here people try to sometimes speak dialects that aren't spoken where they live or grew up and it's a bit annoying because they don't sound natural. I usually mix two dialects because my mom is from one place and dad from another and I just leaned to speak both ways. And sometimes I confuse people by speaking a dialect that isn't spoken around here where I live now. (Dialect and accent aren't the same thing? I'm not sure especially because English isn't my first language xd)
What's wrong with you Jack..?
Irish slang. 1. Feck 2. Me ma 3.bleedin' 4.shyt  Thank you for listening
The schoolboys accent is identical to my grandads, he's intentionally hilarious with it too 😂
Not but seriously sometimes I can't understand Irish people when the mumble and some Irish do mumble
"bangatambatan pandangan mountains"
Been a while jack remember u when I was 7 I'm 16 now nice hair change
Okay but Sean trying to do an American accent when imitating the actors is so underrated.
My ancestors are from Ireland
I love these lovely accents.
Brad pitt’s accent fluctuated between Scottish Australian and Irish. And at some points a mixture of all
this whole video was me trying to decipher literally everything while jack just laughs hysterically
9:00 kind of resembles jamaican patois 😅😅
I'm chilean (south america, Satan's ass, you get it) and I understood the gentleman with the missing sheep a little bit, after watching the video 30 million times and associating Seán's translation with the sounds that came out of that gentleman's mouth... I'm pretty proud of myself tbh
"this is NOT how Irish people speak!" - Irish Person speaking exactly like that
Irish Accent better than Scottish Fair. Italian accent better than Scottish aye right away and dinnae talk pish
as i’m drinking milk eating brownies
Lie dat Jamaican is the sexiest
Why is it when I spend so much time on YouTube I always come back to this video?
"Go back to bed child. Start drinking more milk, Bitch!" 😂
I find it hilarious when Americans try to Irish accents. I can always notice some sounds sound sooooo unnatural.
I’m from NY and I notice that when I talk to people my NY accent gets super duper strong. There are no r’s to be found.
Get someone with a thick irish accent to say 'tree', trust me.
My grandad has a really strong accent and i cant understand half the words hea saying
Your my favourite Irish ☘️ YouTuber well the only one I know
Ma’am please for the love of god stop using your hands so much to speak
The guy from County Louth did not sound Irish.
I need more...
Finally he does a video about the Irish accent.
Wait French is the most beautiful language and Irish is the most beautiful accent is in our person speaking French the most hottest person on earth
We miss you, laddie
I can mostly understand what the rowers are saying
All I got out of that was sheep.
I cant the "man loses all his sheep" i eben put captions on and the poor caption could not even understand it 🤣😂
Sean from RDR2 is the most Irish lad in the world
to be fair to that farmer he's probably a native Irish speaker😭
I'm sorry but in that last wee video donegal is one whole county not 2
If Jack can't understand then no one can UnU
Yo Sean what about Aussie accents
Irish is the language of cursive writing
Look, pal, I'm just a Mexican trying to understand what those Irish people are saying...
Which Irish accent do I like the most?  Yours, of course.  Silly.
I'm Irish and they have a terrible acsent
I love yours. But for some reason I picked it up and now people are constantly trying to tell me that what I said isn't what I said, and it pissing me off!
"Yea, I'm a vowel bender!" 🤣🤣
We do ,literally all irish people run in da fields. But deya know why because our fields are FECKIN beautiful.
I grew up around a lot of welsh and Scottish farmers with incredibly thick accents so I’m used to picking out words and piecing it together to make a sort of sentence so I can usually make out what ppl are saying no matter how thick the accent
Jack was the first english speaking youtuber I started to watch, not because I was interested in games, but because he was one of the few I could actually understand... I'm starting to doubt he's Irish after hearing some irish accent videos
God this reminders me of when i was employed in a callcentre in england as a dutch immigrant and my job was speaking to irish farmers that wanted to make bookings, it was awful i couldnt understand a word they were saying
Fun fact: if one smokes the wacky tobacky, time slows and one suddenly understands the Irish accent
Aye welcome to Ireland where the accent changes every 20 miles 😂
"WHAT the FUCK jeff?" Lmfaooo
Mrs Browns Boys reaction?
How in the fuck was the Scottish accent third!   I'm Scottish and the way we speak is disgusting!
Sèan's Irish Accent in a nutshell: pirate without the jargon
Yeah one who from Kerry is so not from Kerry
Idk you sound like Sean from rdr2
So, Ireland is like Córdoba for Europe
I am Irish 🇮🇪
Do you remember when jack made videos? Pepperidge farm remembers.
Fy faen, han har en spar pose o_o 19:50
As someone whos from and lives in Dublin ive heard most accents from people coming from down the country and stuff but I can understand the majority of irish ppl
"Leprechauns on acid" this killed me
mrs browns boys is based in dublin :P
🏝
11:49 Sean's accent changed so much
My family has a HEAVY irish accent and we all say porch but very elongated and all my none irish friends give out to me
This is probably my new favorite video on YouTube right now besides the Among Us duck game LOL!  Needed a good laugh
Great vid but man the cringe ahhaah we r so stereotyped hahaha
Brad Pitt is doing a Pikey accent not an Irish one, they originally come from Kent. I don't where in time their accents started to turn with the Irish twang
yours was the greatest Sean
english is not my first language, I'm gonna cry, it's been years since I've been this clueless in what someone is saying
You think irland is bad, there are parts ofcthe American east coast and midwest that speak languages that are dead in their native country sill.
Me watching someone try to do a Irish accent I butt in "FECK OFF GET ME A WHISKEY WHIL YA"
I live near athlone but idk if I have a accent but Sean I would guess you grew up near the west but not like mayo or sligo but for Sure like roscommon, Galway or westmeath
Go Hame Jacksepticeye!!!!
How in the name of Saint Patrick  did you Jackspeticeye keep your Thick Accent being away from Ireland ?
The Th in South is just Sout
Mirror.. it's just Mi and 15 R's i am dead lol
Jacksepticeye are there Distinct Differences in Accents in Ireland by Regions and how many are there?
The School Boy Accent was THE best
I think most of them aren't that hard to understand if you listen more. Like most accents for me. 🤷‍♀️  Edit: I got to the last video, and I take it back. 😂
Charles needs to back off *cough cough* leave jack alone Charles *cough cough* ur just jellous
Hearing multiple accents say the letter H. Hearing  "Heych" is a throw off lol
Soooo..."paerk" and "gaerdan"? I'm a tad confused on the phonetic spelling here.
Come to the Netherlands u will have a different accent every 10 minutes
"Drink more milk"
@5:50 i swear it sounds like he's speaking hindi or something
Much to no one's surprise, Wild Mountain Thyme bombed
The guy with the sheep just sounds like someone from eastern kentucky
When I use to work drive thru for a fast-food establishment I use to talk so fast people frequently asked me if I was from Ireland... I don't know how they came to that conclusion 🤷🏻‍♂️
Mon the irish
Froshbut
Hey, you guys think Sean should watch clips from Jeff Dunham and Gabriel Iglesias? He should! The way Jeff does comedy with his puppets, and how Gabriel makes different sounds when it comes to his comedy routines, plus the Racist Gift Basket....! Hilarious!
I feel like the Irish accent, if heavy, is like trying to understand auctioneers that call out bids, not sure exactly what they’re called😂😂
it got to a point it don’t even sound english. i thought i was hearing a  person from Finland talk lol
It sounds like he’s tryna be talking Scots Gallic with sore vocal cords
6:57 omg we finally found peter griffin's father
Up Athlone I'm from athlone
Northern Ireland can get almost impossible to understand
I prefer Romanian accents.
There's a fine lash on them, red and blue and anyone can see it. There's a fine lash on them.  It was a clear night , there be a full moon all night and sure it'd be bright out and anyone could go up in the mountains at night sure Well, there was 45 sheep, ya see Mich, missing like and the lambs, ewes and the sheep and it's come out to a nice bit of money like.  Nothing can be done about it.  2nd chap:  Gaeilge(look up, I heard "i do bhath" and some mumbling, dunno what he said there, probably referring to something geographical)  Come back, come back, come back  I'm missing about 10 yews (or ewes as /u/itsjustneverenough pointed out). It's not all that difficult, all you've got to do is have a good dog, a good dog, go at night some moonshine light. Just put the dog around them, put them on a trailer or walk em and then probably someone else to pick em up. whoever's doing it knows what he's doing.
@12:57 What the fuck, Jeff!  lol
your not irish if you have seen the movie young offenders
One of the worst was Julia roberts in Michael Collins   It was awful
Let me look ma self in tha mirrrrrrrrrrrrrrr.
Whale oil beef hooked!!!! No disrespect intended....I love the Irish accent!!!!
18:02
8:21
Why are our accents so stereotypical  Like jesus lad If you wanted Irish accents, get Irish actors
European accent...😅😅
I don't think it sounds sexy too lol but it sounds cool for sure, and crazy lol the Farmer man.... xD
“He’s got a SPAR bag and he has a knife”  Imagine disrespecting the Rubberbandits like that
Stop swearing pls
Stop saying swearing
Brad Pitt's one sounded like a rough mix of Irish and Canadian accents and I don't really know how to respond other than to laugh uncomfortably
I have Irish ancestry and someone I know trys to do an Irish accent but you could clearly hearers her dudley accent and it pisses me off when she dose it
"The south of Ireland has some of the maddest accents," me, having to visit my gran in rural south Tipperary each summer: yes, yes, they do.    (Or maybe it's just because in Monaghan no-one really knows what our accent is)
12:16 same goes for Scotland M8.
Laughter*
When he said go to bed b**** drink milk made me burst out of lafter
Its just like england every place has is own accent. go to London then go to Manchester. You will know what I mean 😂 PS( don't go to Manchester you will probs get stabbed by on of us 😂)
The one in snatch is Traveller Irish you hear it a lot with the travellers who put on a fake Irish accent ‘but how do you know there faking’ well stranger from the internet I know a few and the first time I spoke to all of them they put this accent on and after a bit it just faded to the regular accent (south walian)
Jack most Irish lads have a farmers accent
Love your accent Jack, I agree the Irish accent is unique and special.
Listening to his accent at the beginning of the vid then fast forwarding to the end is a trip. I feel like his soul transported back there by the end
lol when I first seen that farmer video I couldnt understand a word of it and im from the south east of Ireland, I can pick out what he is saying now kinda
Here's a little lifehack for doing a casual irish accent: start from a stereotypical pirate voice. The pirate "accent" tends to lean hard on Irish as a foundation since they say a lot of irish folk turned to piracy during that notable, brief golden age in history. And it tends to exaggerate the iconic bits because it's not tied to a country or culture that you might insult by going hard on the caricatures. Just make sure it's only the starting point, there's plenty of room for other accents in your standard silly pirate voice, so you need to know when to draw the line and start putting in more thought.
England is a nice city you guys should come here because, after all... “England is.... OUR city...”
Jack does a better Christopher Walken than Walken does of an Irishman, lol
Anyone outside Ireland that claims they can do an Irish accent says “top of the mornin happy st pattys day”
"That's understandable so it's not irish" -Jack
Jesus I'm Irish I can't understand that 😅
If I want to speak an irish accent I'd just watch jack's old videos
i feel like where i live in Australia...because a lot of us speak fast....i can understand most Irish accents fine
its bad when i could understand every thing the irish farmer said - i am irish but i not from kerry-
Bro I pride myself in the ability to understand every accent and it was shattered while watching this video
Boys wtf she’s not north Dublin
Mayo accent is the most neutral.Change my mind.
Sean is 600,000,000 views of 15 billion kinda cool if u ask me
I’m Irish!
Scottish is a mix between Irish and english
The automatic subtitles somehow kinda worked sometimes with the guy's accent, how I don't know.
This is like my 3rd or 4th time going back to this video lmaoo. Idk what exactly it is, but it’s great to see 🤠
“He had a rock tied to his neck” ah yes that New York Irish accent.
Bottom line: you can speak however you want in Ireland
Man, I thought the deep Appalachian American accent was bad…
Am I like the only one who can understand the farmer
The farmer reminded me of a taxi driver my family and I had on our visit to Ireland. Great guy but we couldn’t understand a word of what he said. He was great fun to be around, a really happy person, and to this day we only understood one sentence: “Ah, so you’re a fighter from way back.” He said this to my mom after finding out she was a part of the Davidson Clan in Scotland lol 😂
Why was the start of the video so whimsical
Wow, I’m totally in love with the Irish accent‏ since I heard Sean from Red dead redemption 2   Love from Middle East ☘️
Can you teach us more-? 😭🤚
Jacksepticeye is one of those people I watched before he completely blew up and now it just feels weird to click on one of his vids.
im irish and i can only a bit of what the farmer said
Brad? WHAt? WtH. Ive just been confused the entire video
there's actually a song called wild mountain thyme and i sang it with my madrigal choir in high school
Oim goiunu shyte en yar gaerdin
It’s not a heavy accent— it’s their own language.
8:15 he sounds like he is trying to speak Chinese but it sounds like legitimate gibberish.
Sean! You should definitely come back to Ireland On a trip and do a vlog for each county or town ye visit
oi love oirish, when me bye grohs op, oima teach it to im
i'm belgian and my irish is better than his XD
My Favorite bit was 8:00
The shepherd lad sounds like he’s talking backwards
All I'm questioning is how the hell Australia of all countries was on number 5 on sexiest accents in the world.......... just how
That "acting coach" and those like here im the US, are the reason why Hollywood continues to absolutely butcher the Irish accent by having American actors play it in that stereotypical sounding, basically comedic style.  People, Brendan Gleeson, Liam Neeson,  Michael Fassbender, these are all "normal" Irish accents, you don't need to make us sound like uneducated fairies that live off the land with no knowledge of the outside world anymore! We even have electricity here now too ;)
11:33 father Jack anyone
some of these accents are from a time when many people live their entire life without leaving 1 village so there was no need or desire for any outsiders to understand how they talk
FROSTBUTT
Im from ireland aka Dublin and I dont know what the farmer is saying lol🤣
That's fine my man. I'm southern U.S. born and raised, if I'm not careful the way I talk I'll sound less like keanu reeves and more like Sandy the squirrel.
My great grandfather (or was it his dad?) was from there. My grandfather was Scotch-Irish overall. As a result, my grandfather kept a close tie with his heritage. I have always wanted to visit, and I hope I will get to one day.
They should have just casted my grandad like he would have been the perfect Irish farmer 😩
I wanted to visit ireland before.. but now im scared
Home na we say welcome back to the gaf now
Christopher walken doing Irish is so unnecessary and hilarious loool
Fun, amazing video! I love listening to the different accents!.
northside dublin getting the representation
Kinda reminds me of all those german accents (i think swiss is the worst)
Some of these people accents almost sound like when you play a piece of audio backwards
2:21 Arnold Schwarzenegger
I know he said vowel bender but I could have sworn he said bowel blender
2:21 gru
6:12 wtf 🤣🤣
Sometimes when I go on a long binge of your videos I can feel myself starting to steal your accent, it’s not intentional but I start talking with certain ~Irish ~ qualities I can trace back to you
That's not Irish. That's the holy mother tongue... Bogfukkinese. Our ears aren't worthy.
I've finally watched this video and I found out that Irish accents sound like Newfie accents.
How can Emily blunt look young in this and old in a quiet place
I'm From Wexford, And Watching American's Impersonate Irish People Is Personally Insulting
Alright we covered the accent, now we need to cover the Actual Language
Ever heard a west virginian accent?
I think he might be speakin Irish not English Irish I think is Gaelic am I right?
Love ur vids jack!!😁
I'm scot-irish American dought I could do an Irish accent though!
11:46
"I'm a vowel-bender" 🤣🤣👌🏽
Nice shirt! I has the same one!
When he translated that farmer I was like how ?!
My dads side are welsh and i could understand most of it
In Snatch they actually say it isn't Irish, but something different.
Am Irish
Canada is the Ireland of French! Québec is Dublin, Nouveau-Brunswick is *_cARk!_*
No one:  Not even jack:      Me: *laughs at the fucking seagul squak*
"I'm a vowel bender." Had me dead! ☠
I don't know but i was a month long all over Ireland and i dint had any problems but scotland oh boi that was different
The Irish accent is equivalent to Jamaican patois; no one understands a damn thing we say. 🤣
The irish accent just evolved from people being drunk.
I found the rowers perfectly, and delectably, comprehensible in every word they were saying. The farmers I could catch the gist of what they were saying but most of the words a blur.
Ur man with the spar bag was the rubberbandits
I keep laughing when jack slowly turns to the camera and says OYL
Jack you’re on team nitro cause you’re Irish!!!! ☘️
it sounded like michael with the mad accent was speaking in the gaelic tongue
well actually Sean, us New Zealanders actually have the sexiest accent in the world from 2020-. and coming in second place is aussie and next is english then next is irish.... sorry bout that lad.
That’s one of the reasons why I love seán he tell France and Italy to fuck off and eat shit but when it comes to Scotland all he says is no luck love from Scotland 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 ❤️ and also at the teaching an Irish accent I think she’s doing a stereotypical Irish accent
there is no bad accent...
I think some of the Irish women accents sound beautiful or just super sexy
We lost Sean to the accent a couple times there. It's like me with my country accent. Listening to it makes it stronger...
Is it a curse or a gift, that I understood most of what they were saying?
What.....the fuck is dis man sayin???
Also the first one sounds like a mix of Irish, Scottish and American
Thanks alot for the scotland thing. Dick. (Still my fav youtuber tho)
WOOO we are the most sexiest
Absolutely love all Irish accents
0:23 Well, at least we are 2nd you know...
Wait don’t you start your videos with “top of the mornin to ya!”
"Whale oil be fooked"
I remember I heard RT game imitating a taxi driver he had, and I think the taxi driver said “Asher, where are you heading now” but it blended together and sounded like “Ashwherdyahedna”… idk how y’all understand that
when sean was trying to do the cristopher walken irish thing he sounded like arnold schwarzenegger 2:18
I do agree that jacksepticeye’s accent is hot. Along with his looks too
People on the USA news and UK news be talking about the guns and acid attacks.   *and then there’s ireland talking about sheep thief’s, people protesting about guinness getting wasted in drains and kids selling ducks on snapchat*
Is it just me or has anyone else's Irish accent become more profound when watching jack 😅(I'm Irish)
I watched that movie at Christmas while drunk actually hated it but I found of very funny while drunk 😂😂😂
Ahhhhhh my favorite translator
This guy is cool and vary funny I would like to meet this guy because of I heard that he is funny and I would like to know things about to fix my YouTube channel
I'm from Co. Kerry and I've never heard the accent that heavy before🤣🤣
For the life of me, I have the hardest time accepting that accents change in such small distances. In the U.S., you have to travel so far for an accent to change. In Ireland, England, or anywhere in the UK, the accent changes every 5 blocks. So weird.
If you want to hear some "questionable" Irish accents, just watch the Michael Collins movie.  I'm Irish and I can barely understand the guy in the thumbnail.
awwww i wanted to see the rest of the last video...
14:02  “the “t” sound is always like a “sh” sound”  me who doesnt even pronounce the t at all: 😎
I think brat Pitt was going for a gypsy Irish accent
13:28  *G E N E R A L  K E N O B E H H*
I have not hear a girl Irish accent but I think it Is scotsh
So, I’m Russian and it takes me a few rewatches instead videos like the farmers one, but I can understand an accent like Richie Griffin’s. Still, it’s tough even with 25 years of practicing the language. I gave up trying to do accents outside the generic ones you’d hear in video games, but I try to be able to understand as many as I can.  Oh and please tell me about how bad people are at doing your homeland’s accents)
We have the same headphones.  Also it's probably better an actual Irish person makes a video on how to do an Irish accent... 🤔 That's just common sense.
I’m Irish and Italian, should I be offended or not?
"Sexiest" or "most sexy", but not "most sexiest".
"Haha eat shit, France"  ~Jacksepticeye
I am part Irish although I don’t have much of the accent, because some of my family came from Ireland, but I am Canadian all the way. I also have some Scottish, Welsh and English in me. I can do it pretty passable English accent, I can tell you that. Years ago I knew somebody that had a English accent fetish, and without thinking I did an English accent around him, and he’s like oh stop that…because he was somebody else’s boyfriend. I was like, I’m sorry! I wish I could do a good Irish, or Scottish accent though.
10:10 shes already annoying
The sheep farmers are the Irish equivalent of Boomhauer.
Madeline Harvey is the same girl that says that Canadian say aboot not about
the guy who has the really heavy accent sounds like my dad !
im american and i understand everything you say. I think the american accent is similar to the irish accent.
Me who is not an Irish: oOooOoh these people speak voices  edit: the only thing I heard from the other sean(the man who lose a lot of sheep) is sHepP
Your accent makes me simp for you.
jack: drink some more milk bitch   me: i am dude chill out i just picked up my cup mate
The guy: *smack the horse*  The horse:🥵👋🥵
Ah yes all we do is frolock in fields with cattle fairys yes yes
2:22 he sounds like gru
Is maith liom Gaeilge
That's not an accent these people just can't speak English
damn even the subtitles couldn't understand the poor farmer lmao smh
The sheep guy sounds like he’s talking in reverse
that sheep accent video sounds like he is trying to do both German and Irish combined Lol
ok i’m irish and these people trying to do an irish accent is pissing me off
Ireland never die!
The puns I die
The silent ghana relatively deserve because pedestrian pathologically poke against a colorful trigonometry. new, trite professor
19:19 I didn’t even understand that he paused it and started speaking himself
0:42 Jack milk gang?
Eat sh!t France 😂 btw, hello from South East 👍
Jack: "he had a rock tied to his neck" Me: wtf are you trying to be terminator
I am Italian😢
I know you smacking a horse, you do it every time before bed :)
@jacksepticeye can you speak in irish?
Yeah covids bad but did ye know I'm missing 45 sheep? Sean McDonald quick get the news van this is the most exciting thing that's happened here since the 64 Nessie sighting
You should've shown a clip of that one episode of Drake & Josh where they both spy on there sister Megan cause she has a boyfriend, and they disguise themselves as Hasidic Jews but for some random yet funny reason they sound Irish, it is hilarious but crazy cause there are no Jews in Ireland, or are they.
As an Irish person I can confirm that you don’t sound like the lad from southern Kerry cos I can understand ye perfectly
“This doesn’t sound Irish, why are their accents so bad in this movie?”  Proceeds to demonstrate that real Irish accents are incomprehensible
Exactly how my fiancé sounded before he passed but with a country accent as well lol.
Bruh the man at the end got me 😂😂
Emily blunt sounds like shes waterford
14:12 I concur; If it’s any consolation at all, Sean, as another autistic man with Celtic heritage, I have a lot of respect for Ireland and the uk (along with many others, of course) so count yourself into that category; never forget that you are a great person who comes from a nation of great people, even though there are many:) plus, at 16:06 i think that us americans basically stole this line and made it our own, lol
So interesting, The T in Australian accent also sounds like SH lol
Yes Irish accent I'm Irish it the se*iset my accent is mixed with Dublin and limerick
That dog is more Irish and it’s a Australien shepherd
Now here is a question, what county has the best accent?
Yep so, I got anxius bc its literaly my granpa with vocals problems talking
Reminds me of here in texas the further south you go the more unique accents youll hear
Ah yes, getting cursed out of a pub is incredibly sexy. 🥵
As a fellow Irish man, IM *&£# OFF
The irish accent was voted seciest accent of the year which we spent most of stuck in our homes and primarily or only ever connecting on the internet...
I love how these accents are so heavy that we have to believe in good faith that the translations Jack gives are accurate cause I sure as hell don't know xD
you know the dragon prince? it has a character in it with an accent. dont know which accent- but an a c c e n t  edit: *i just found out its a scottish accent- my bad*
My accent is a mix between Irish and Australian
Believe me or not but I spoke with him today.
not gunna lie some of these accents, the way they're spoken (the tonality?) sounds like it could be canadian. I've heard some newfies (peeps from newfoundland) talk like this but a lot of them actually do come from scotland and ireland. but if you slow it down, and anunciate a bit more, these would be passable strong canadian accents. And as a Canadian myself, its tripping me tf out.
anyone else hear frost butt
The Irish Farmer sounds like he is speaking Bavarian German and English at the same time and it is very confusing. The Irish student sounds like he lived in the Rhineland for a while, came back to Ireland and had an even more confusing accent.
Christopher Walken trying to be Irish sounds like he is trying to do a very bad Arnold Schwarzenegger impression.
it's lowkey like Swedish, we have so many dialects here. Every city has their own dialect, it's beautiful. Even when we're speaking English it's different depending on the Swedish dialect we have. Well except those who have good English accents lmao but yea, I love accents and dialects. I find it so beautiful and it tells a story love it, wish I had one
I'm scared because he can still translate the accents EVEN THO IT SOUND LIKE GIBBERISH
HIYA!
Forget Irish accent, that farmer is speaking the Irish language
its the same as Scotland the Americans think we always say freedom the land of the free when
5:31 I wasn't even trying to hear what he was saying because I thought he was speaking a different language
11:50 LMAO 😂
Jack please invent a language that only consists of screaming and Irish swearing
I really saw "British accents" out of the title
Me: *is irish, has irish accent* My brother: *is irish...is mute, makes fun of our accent* 💀
Brad pitt sounds like a traveler thats just bit his tongue and its swollen up 😂. Its so weird and sounds kinda lispy. Also half my family is from Kerry and I couldn't understand that farmer, That's one hell of an accent.
Sexiest? Don't flatter yourself. Most abrasive? For sure.
Ya like dags?
I got Irish
I live in county Kerry
Snatch is a cinematic masterpiece.
Child: *makes fun of jack*  Jack: DRINK MORE MILK BITCH!
Awesome this was fun to watch
Flare is how to say floor in Scottish
this is a bad Irish have I ever heard from this show on YouTube bruh
The irish accent according to that women is just chew on something and speak without swallowing.
This is why I want to live in Ireland. I saw on an American news channel that police had ruthlessly killed a teen. Why do they always report the sad stupid stuff? I'd rather see a guy's farty-foive sheep missin' and cold frostbutt.
That's why I always have a stonk on when I watch your videos makes sense now
13:24
Does he not know who the rubberbandits are? 20:02
I'm irish and yoo all these people trying to have an accent yo you sound like you have been draged through a ditch  and you only woke up bruh
My great grandfather is Irish and I thought he had a thick accent.
Christopher Walken's accent just sounds like be bit his tongue
I want to be an Irish sheep
*farty five*
You make me want to move to Ireland
8:14 “frostbutt””
BEST VIDEO EVER SO FUCKING FUNNY xD
Irishman u mean  southern ulster man
I liked the music in the background of this vid
Wow I really learned how little my ears are trained for Irish accents, to me the girl teaching the accent sounded just like Jack... just me... oh okay ... lol
Lol it seems like the less I understand the better Jack says the accent is lmao
Please do a part 2 (love from waterford)
The farmer's accent sounds like Pingu's.
the sheep guy sound like a gcse german class
Hahahahaha
The Welsh and Scottish can be difficult
I’d love it if Jack would give commentary on Father Ted episodes
Say flower? Ah yes floor
If Jack could react to the handsome bastard that is Zane Flynt from Borderlands 3 😍😍😍, like Zane's accent and his loony responses
This is my fourth time watching this video and I don't think I'll ever understand Mikey's distorted english
I can do a Scottish accent, which is just a country Irish accent
when Jack said that Irish people don't say "top of the MARNIN to ya!" I died inside and realized that my life was a lie.
Can Horses Sound Irish?
With some of those, particularly the farmer guy, I was like, "is that even English?"
The blond north side Dublin girl is gorgeous what's her name Jack any idea?
I honestly thought the Kerry farmer said at the start he said the sheep had a fine arse on them that's riding them anyone could see it. hahahaha wouldn't surprise me with a Kerry man 😂😂😂. I'm Irish and I couldn't make head nor tail of what he was saying. Just could make out a few words here and there of what he was saying. the rest was gobble de gook 😂😂😂
I am 80% or so Irish but no one believes me because I don’t have an accent because I was born in new mexico
things ive noticed since watching jack.  1. when he gets angry his accent gets stronger  2. when he gets drunk his accent gets much stronger  3. when he says fuck its a lot more like FUUK
8:24 That's Northern Irish!!! That's my country mate! We are worse. Half of us are republican and want to join Ireland and the other half Loyalists want to stay with Britain and want Ireland to be apart of the UK
is it bad if i said i understood everything everyone said?
My crush after I ask her out: your not sexy   *laughs in 5th sexiest accent*
FARTY FIVE😭😭😭😭
Omg the Kerry farmer sounds just like my uncle in law. Jesus and my accent is a mix of limerick and meath cause of me ma and da. I pity my muinteoirs idfk how they understand me.🤣
The Kerry woman - I was like... Is Welsh an Irish accent now???
4:52 is where I’m here for.
16:48 is the best
I also relied that Jack, sometimes i do this,not a whole lot but, instead of to, he says ta
In good ol' USA we also have many many different accents. Like up in hollywood it sounds british, but down in california it might sound "American", or over in the middle states it might sound like a combintation, with a mix of different words. Like sometimes i yall, or even you all. It just depends. Many languages are weird.
My kids are Irish and I have some Irish heritage (from Kerry….) but being Australian they say our accent was born out of everyone being pissed and their kids following suit.
Might as well hire some Leprechauns...
I know what Jack means by Irish people not actually "Top of the Mornin' to ya." As a Texan, I have met people who think we say "yeehaw" all the time and shit. We don't.

My mom is Irish and my dad is Italian so most of the time I speak with an Italian accent but when I get mad my Irish accent shines through
Bro I swear I heard at least a couple Arabic words in the sheep guy’s video.
"How to do an Irish accent". Just go live in Ireland for a few months, you'll be talking like them in no time, it's a very contagious accent, I love it.
Irish people:                        Australian people:                               🤝    Accent never done properly in media
Emily’s accent is so shocking
I read Irish as British
What men think women want : Hon hon hon oui oui baguette What women actually want :
Translation was beautiful thank you jack
This makes me want to see Jack translate thick Newfie and east coast accents.
Burn Notice. Fiona and Micheal Irish Accents. Great show to watch if you have a couple months
Well no that I think about u don’t sound irsh but ya idk it’s weird cuz ur English and other people sound like the from spain
No u can talk great
When you start the video then go and get food and come back to “Drink more milk BITCH!”
No one  My Adhd: Ooh, he speaks like this, let's mimic his ascent to seem more normal.
the irish guy who lost his sheep, the speaking soyunds like swedish.
I'm so late to the party on this but if Wild Mountain Thyme wanted a pale ginger Irish woman as a lead, why not just get Angela Scanlon? she's like the most stereotypically Irish woman i can think of
6:50 I swear I heard "Put a dagger on them, put on a treadmill walkin"
I love hearing our Irish brethren argue; absolutely beautiful
How did i not know that sean went to my college, mad.
Dis bad content. Me no like
why dont so many utube channel wannabes say  tumasm  its easer and not hal as ear drainning
which is not alan coogan ha steve coofan in the trip whoops fail hehe
your accengt is like  a rob brydon version  of say micheal caine and the framer is the real accent done by alan coogan  which is authentic, legs say yours is over exagerated , no offence
its not that hard  just open your ears s
i understood the farmer  how can anyone go in the mountains  easy am not irish
come on christopher put a bit of effort into it, put your back in to it
Tommy wayching:👁👄👁
I don’t know if they’re gonna say this yet but the best Irish-based pick up line is "are you from Ireland, because when I look at you my dick is Dublin."
I like that no one seems fazed that the sheep are painted pink and blue.
Seán I love your videos but why insult my county Scotland
The only Irish people I know is JackSepticEye and Niall Horan ☺️. They should be mates
Irish Accent HARDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD but cooll at the same times B)
As an Australian....I'm most confused at WHY IS AUSTRALIA NUMBER 5? Who the hell thinks it's sexy?
so top of the morning is like Australian ausie ausie oy
The lady who’s trying to teach an Irish accent looks like hiccups mother...
We wore Vauted ash ta greeaatesht accent in da woorld.
Its Oiland not Ireland. Get it right.
Best part of the video was when the Olympian stated “We’re in Rio” lol no kidding
I legit thought he was lying about the translation at first lol
I couldn't tell who was talking between those two Olympic medalists. I think they're doing ventriloquism.
is Farty five , 45 or 35?
0:23 me being italian: 👁💧👄💧👁
rt's county Louth
Why does nobody realise that Brad Pitt was playing an Irish traveller and the accent was actually good
It is like the scene from hot fuzz I need an Irish friend to translate Sean and he’s translating an Irishman
2:21 he sounds like gru
Brad pitt sounds like a newfoundlander not an irishman
Jack: Eat shit france Me: Don't people already eat shit
I loved the video, and believing that you guys have many accents is no issue for me. I am Swiss, we're about 8 or so million people and there are propably about 12 million ways to speak Swiss German. That may be one of the reasons I have no problem understanding most of the English accents worldwide (unless they come from a tiny mountain town with like 4 inhabitants, those become their own language in my opinion - it's the same here) - my ears are used to understanding similar speech to the one I already know.
When you did the Christopher Walken impression just ended up sounding like Bill Burr 😂
I'm Irish and I can't understand it haha
The Irish accent is like men’s handwriting
Sounds like they’re speaking in cursive
I like how he was making fun of Italy, Scottland, and France at the begining XDD
i love being irish
the farmer sounds like my welsh uncle with a mix of my irish grandad
Are you from Dublin
Poor horse 😂
I kinda see the Irish accent as the Southern Drawl of Europe. Not the Alabama one, but like the sexy cowboy one
You should listen to finnish people speaking english
Title: Irish Accents that even I can't Understand. Me: Well There's A surprise, Accents even Not Jack (Sean) Himself Can't Understand.
Me after watching this video: imma just watch this video for the next two hours while I wait for my Siri to change its accent...  (Two hours later)  ITS IRISH FONALLY
I’m 35% Irish I don’t have a Irish accent, probably because I didn’t grow up In a Irish family
the language of the gods
I understood every one of these except half of the south Ireland sheep one, but I was born and raised in america
People take the piss out of Australian accents. No matter where you are people will take or try to do an impression of another accent lol
I don’t know much about the Irish but um no those lines came out like a fresh turd with no spice. I’ll freeze my aye- sa?
chante l'alphabet s'il te plait
one thing i picked up watching jack i dont know if its offensive but i picked up the way he says what
Honestly I don't pronounce the T on most word the end with t
I fucking loved this shit been having a rough ass week n this the first thing that’s made me laugh in awhile
"Start drinkin more milk bitch heeeeeeh". Favorite part of this
Canadian accents are kinda like weak irish ones. I grew up in a place where people had really fucking thick accents and you couldn't understand them unless you lived there😂
im both scottish and irish
tbh when i was watching interviews with soairse ronan, she would always get so annoyed and pissed at anybody who tries (jokingly) speaking in an irish accent. I honestly thought that was just her and she was just short tempered with those kinds of things. Now i see its just normal with irish people
I'm having too much fun right now!
First language is Ukrainian second is English some thing that man was say at first video  translated to wire word in Russian and Ukrainian
maryland accent is also just mirrrrr for mirror (not sure about baltimore)
accent lady is so cringe
I don’t fucking know what the sheep dude was saying
It's so true about the kerry accent being strong, trust me I'm from kerry and I cant even understand my cousin
You forgetting the part where Brad Pitt in snatch is a traveller, his accent isn’t pure Irish.
5:43 it is actually Shaun the sheep
I'm actually Scottish
I had an Irish friend and her dads accent was absolutely terrible
Watches the video once: What??? Watches four more times: HUH??!?!
Me: Is Irish, but has american accent, watching the thick accent parts. "H-holy shit dude thats T H I C K !"
How to gain an accent:   Step 1: Speak the language.
No you do not sound like that Mr SeAn.
I have no problem understanding any of these... But I'm from the south, in the USA. So lots of people have a hard time understanding my family too. 🤷🏼‍♀️
am i the only one who got mad when he said pronounced herb with the h?
Jack: "Music you call it? music?"  What's going through his head: "Ah, feckin shite! feck all dis shite!" (aka music to Jack's ears)
Aye reminds a lot of the Scottish accent.
sorry but irish accents sounds like a lumber jack and i can’t find that accent sexy at all
Jack how could you? You decided to end the video right when he was getting to northern ireland! :(
"oil" as in "well oil be fooked"
Brad pitt sounds like a newfy
For all my Italians. Dont worry we'll get it this year. At least we got 2nd!😂😂😂
Yup out of that come on DA IRISH
The farmer sounds like what Norwegian sounds to Swedes
The English is so bad that we beet the shit out of them  drunk lads
Nah Scotland should've been #1
6:02 it is like Sean is translating another language
19:18 I didn't even realize jack paused the video 🤣🤣🤣
It's fucking gaelga
I'm 10 and Irish and I drink  beer
Every accent is specific to a local area not just a country. I for an instance speak Finnish in a way to replaces some d with r and also extend h and inject it into some words where the word doesn't have h written. My sister replaces some finnish words with English words while speaking Finnish because of her accent.
I say mirror like you do but I have a southern accent/country/yeehaw accent
Surprised I didn’t see that video of the really old Irish guy in the bar whose accent is super thick and you can safely infer that he hasn’t left the bar since 1934
abeut farty feive sheep n lembs
I like how the accent says he can't understand them yet the heaviest accent he fucking knew EVERYTHING
I've noticed that these insane accents all come from people who don't know how to open their mouths while talking.
Farty five
when the old pastor talked i just get "the full moon" and something about "night". I love Ireland and irish people <3
0:40 epic roast.
hey, look, I agree that Irish accents are sexy (along with Scottish and Northern English), but lord...some of these guys don't even sound like they're speaking English
i honestly don’t hear an accent anymore while listening to sean
Hey guys I’m gonna go play with my chest hairs and eat potato chips
Ah I remember when I visited Ireland...our tour guide would speak to us in “normal” English and then when he’d congregate around with his other colleagues...I just heard *heavy Irish accent Englishy sounds*
Even me who’s Irish can’t understand half of what that man on rte was saying
now why we couldent do jack for sean in rdr2
Saw the bit of the movie with Brad Pitt and in the movie itself made a statement that Brad Pitt's character, and his whole gang, speaks with a broken Irish accent because he's a gypsy. So the badness of the accent was a point.
They focus on acting ability before accents when they cast actors. Emily Blunt is in that movie because she's a good actor. The very British Tom Holland plays the American Peter Parker because he's a good actor.
Reminds me of Denmarks different types of accents
when jack was practicing along side the vocal coach "by god,. hes a natural"
the vocal coach: (smth along the lines of) "when you say 'i'll' it sounds like 'oi' , like oil" me, an american: yes. that is what irish people sound like seán: (smth along the lines of) "no not at all" .... .. . .. are you /sure/?
Yeet
I’m able to do a Irish accent because I am Irish ☘️
Taint an accent, tis a brogue 🇮🇪
Jack:a Do you think (tink) Irish people just stand around in fields holdin our arms out all day?  5:19
The olympic guys almost sounded like a Swede accent
jack do a Russian accent.
i lost most of what he said, its like being in in the rural parts of Tennessee.
no matter where you're from. everyone's accent is influenced on where they spent the most time. its incredibly difficult to replicate them. unless you move there for a few years and are the friendliest bastard in 5 counties.
2:14 just cast Irish people! *Jamie Dornan pops up*
I actually understood the second guy
i loved this
I imagine it's sorta like an American southern accent lol. Generally we can understand but sometimes it's a bit difficult 😂
I cant understand anything but im laughing
Watching you for years is making me have a little bit of an Irish accent
as an american i can understand most of what these people are saying but thats because my great grandperants had a super thick accent when they get excited or angry.
I love how jack made a seprete video for Irish accent s
I wonder if people that aren't american and try to replicate the accent think they sound american or not.  They aren't good at it lmfao either and we americans can hear as well when you try to mimic it.
when I try to do the I to Oi vocal coach thing and Oireland I just sound like Nogla
I'd say Jack's accent is half way between Nogla's and Brian's
TURN ON THE SUBTITLES ON THE HEAVY ACCENTS
Hot Fuzz is one of my favorite movies too. Fun fact, the character you mentioned, whose accent was so thick it had to be translated twice, also played Argue Filch in the Harry Potter movies.
Sean begging to be let back into ireland has the same energy as me begging to be let back into georgia after being in texas so long
ima british person whos form southern england and people think my accent is hard to understand HAHA
I like how he does not say anything immature to Scotland because they are the other Gaelic
I wanna hear you try an American accent
9:16 "So I was there for a hour or two, trying to take a pee into his cup for him...."
The funniest thing is that I was in Skibbereen for 5 months for an internship program. It was so hard to understand their accent and English is not even my first language. So watch this on your channel now, just cracked me up :')
My brother can do an almost perfect jacksepticeye impression
Well I kinda understand some stuff Irish people say because I'm Scottish but the thick accents I dont have a clue
I could've sworn that Kerry sheep herder was talking about mountains, and Jack's translation's got nothing to do with mountains. I've failed you Sean, yet I believe everyone else did as well.
I thought I was going to be clever and turn on the subtitles...and then I just ended up laughing until I cried 🤣
You sounded like Father Jack at 11:35 😂🤣😂🤣
I'm sorry Jack but I'm an American 5:26 farty feiv??
I literally live in ireland and i cant understand a thing that old guy said
GHET FOHK’D ITALY
lol
sus
I lived in the UK for 5 years and, before that, my accent was american (even though I'm not). But after living in the UK, it just became... weird. Like a weird mix between English and my original american sounding one. But I stg, I had to many English people ask me if I'm irish, like... I don't understand how they thought I sound anything like an Irish person. But there you have it folks, if you wanna trick English people into thinking you have an Irish accent, take some american, mix it with some english and you're good.
Never fails to make me laugh
Russian?
A lot of those sounded like a newfie accent. Nicest people on the planet.
I absolutely love the sound of a pissed of Irishman going out on a swear binge! Earin' em' cal me a fookin' coont! It's so magical! Darty bahstrds!! Hands down THE sexiest accent alive!
this Irish accent must be like eastern Canadian Accent.
fln Jacks got some greys goin on LOL
Did I do ok in the translations if I could make out a couple full sentences
Irish people slur more words than cajuns and its amazing
Me an Australian but has family from Scotland and Ireland with HEAVY accents - perfectly distinguishable (think that’s the right word 😅) Yeah nah honestly the only time I do get a wee bit of a Scottish accent is when I’m pissed pissed 😂 don’t get me wrong I’ve an Australian accent but with certain words I go full Scottish/Irish
Coincidence that Seán in RDR2 is also Irish
It's not Irish though, it's Pykie
We just found out I’m more Irish than I am of African descent or any other ethnicity.  Funny enough, my iPad named Riku understands the man who lost his sheep and every Irish person in this video better than he understands any way I generally speak.
Am i just one of the only people who misses the WAPOOSH TOPPATHAMARNINTOYA MY NAME IS JACKSEPTICEYE?
great now all my thought are in an irish accent
god i love irish people
Sad that I am like 2% irish I understand everything
Try doing Scottish accents they are insane
JACK, review the Newfoundland (Newfie) accent!!
Jack: talking about Wild Mountain Thyme Me: "Oh jack is saying it how people say its supposed to be pronounced." (though honestly either way is correct) Jack: "not time like oh I'm late for a meeting, but thyme like the Herb" pronounced herb with the h Me: nearly spits out my Pepsi o_o"
Jacksepticeye: get fucked Italy  Me as an Italian: :(
6:50 I mean, i understood what Richie said perfectly, Mikey tho... that guy was just speaking in some kinda lost dialect, c'mon now, that's nowhere near the english language...
“In English we say I, in Irish we say Oy”
I swear I thought the farmer slipped into an Asian language at some points. Not trying to be racist or funny, I legit thought I recognized some other words.
I haven’t watched Jack in a bit and when he didn’t do thee intro I was severely disappointed
Me: okay i've had to deal with some real strong accents over the years, i'm sure i'll be fine picking out what they're saying Irish sheep farmer: [speaks] Me: *oh this is some god-tier shit*
The farmer might be speaking gaelic but i don't think so....
omg i can understand what he is saying thanks to the power of subs, when i read i can hear it!
Cloisim fucking níos mó den ima seo ag bualadh an bhuicéid
The mad lad sounds like my da
Harvey is Scottish. Why the feck is a woman with a Scottish last name teaching people a really bad Irish accent
for people who aren’t aware, Gaelic is a whole dialect. it’s essentially it’s own language
1 Italy and Irish 2 Scotland
That guy with sheep tho... Thought he was chinise
That guy with sheep tho... Thought he was chinise
I'm glad I was raised in Ireland to be able to understand them
I love this video more every time I watch it
If the movie were fully in irish, no one but irish people will be able to understand
Jack giggling is so wholesome 😅
irish music is the best
If I watched this video a bunch I’d probably start talking in a mixed Irish accent and would confuse everyone I know 😂
Mayo 4 Sam!
Brad Pitt was doing a Traveller/Gypsy Irish Accent
Brad Pitt wasn’t supposed to be Irish in snatch tho. It was supposed to be a mix of different accents so does that one count?
I could actually understand the 2 olympic guys perfectly
I hate these accent people
Jack what about Sean from RDR2 is that a good Irish accent
So I’m from the US (Dallas, Texas) and I only really found the farmers difficult to understand.
I’m Scottish
"Drink more milk bitch!" That needs to be a shirt
Irish people are a different breed but their funny as hell  😂🤣
Omg I know how you feel, I live in London and I have no other irish people around me
watch sgt duckys "The nearly accurate guide to Ireland"
im irish and cant understand the lad from kerry
THANK YOU so much for translating the farmer video, it really had my scratching my head in confusion.
I can't understand a damn thing that guy with the sheep says. It's like those images where you can't even name one thing in it
When I first saw Snatch I got the feeling that the Brad Pitt one was supposed to be a bit unintelligible for everyone - even his mates. I felt like he nailed it  xD (unintelligible I mean)
Growing up, I was obsessed with Ireland and it's traditions / cultural aspects [I still am honestly]. When I was younger, I learned from my grandparents [on my mother's side] that I had Irish in me [I don't know if it's like a small percentage or more, they didn't say] and it was one of the most exciting things to learn about myself. For some reason, I wanted to try and embrace that part of me by trying to be more irish and the first thing that came to mind was learn to speak with an Irish accent. So, I looked up a bunch of videos and stuff to learn how, but every time I tried to do it I felt like I was offending an entire country and it made me feel embarrassed by the thought. I mean, I'm somewhat learning still, but I've noticed that I tend to use one at random like when I hear someone else do it, my brain feels prompted to do it and before I even get a chance to stop myself I randomly start talking in that accent and it's so weird because my friends and family will look at my weird like, “Where the fuck did that come from?”  [Edit]: Apparently the when you randomly copy an accent it's called Unconscious Accent Mimicry or AKA The Chameleon Effect!
Smash that like button in the face like a boss
I think my Irish roots or my alcoholism came out cause I understood the talk
Sean the professional Irish accent translator
Moroccan Arabic is the equivalent of Irish in the Middle East, they're impossible to understand, these guys speak Arabic, Tamazight, Spanish and French all as one language it's insane, literally only 3 countries around the entire region understand them because they share similar dialects. The rest of us just listen to Moroccan Arabic and wander into space.
my family is scots-irish and throughout the american south there's a huge population of scots-irish people that have been coming here for centuries.  my family came in the 1600s as indentured servants and then moved through the south, staying in Alabama for a while and eventually Arkansas.  in certain parts of arkansas and along the south end of the Appalachians you can hear how the accent has stuck around.   The video of the farmer was neat because, while I couldn't understand everything, I recognized an intonation and rhythm that I'm familiar with
my great uncle had an even stronger accent than that jack 5:35
In defense of Pitt in Snatch, while his character might have been Irish, he’s also a gypsy, who in the film are said to be completely unintelligible. So maybe there was some Irish in there but really Pitt was just sortof making it up, making his accent sound all over the place.
It's probably because I have a speech impediment that I understood most of what the sheep missing farmer said lol
Irish Tom hanks??
It's a pity there's no subtitles.. irish accents are great 😁
My best friend is from Dublin and was the best man at my wedding. His accent made it possible to get people to toast a disgusting speech, lol. He spoke into the microphone and yelled "TO HONOR!" and as everyone including my elderly grand parents yelled a reply he muttered as they drank "to get on her and stay on her and if you can't cum in er cum on er."
8:07 It sounds like you would find a hidden message if you rewind what he said lol
I haven’t watched you in a long while but I can confirm even the Irish accents I can’t understand are incredibly sexy
One of the things about Walken is not so much his accent as his manner of speech. Which is why he's the best SNL guest host.
haha EAT SHIT FRANCH oui oui honhonkhonkhonkhonkhonkhon
to me it sounds like the farmer is speaking swedish or smn. and I'm danish, I know a good chunk of Swedish just by being danish
Jack are you from clotting in offaly
First video of you I ever watched I’m new lol I love your channel! Never subbed so fast
the oil thing i heard it allot
I don't think you sound like that. I can understand you
Some irish and scottish accents soundd like you had a stroke... 😂 Thats probably how The accents came to be in The first place, they spoke regular english then someone had a stroke and everyone just started thinking that person said it the right way and keept at it 😂
Did he say all you need is a good, “dragon?” 😭
"Irish people don't say that" says the man who's been using it as an intro to his videos for ages. :P
"I as in Owl"
I always found Irish similar to scouse, anyone?
As non native english speaker trying to understand these people talking, gosh my head hurts so bad I can't understand even a word, especially the Olympics gold medalists
Jack they'll never know how to speak Irish like the Irish!
I would pay millions to sound just like a strong Irish man
I went to Ballymaloe Cookery School, east of Cork, for a 3 month course. I spent a total of 6 months just exploring Ireland, though. Hoooooly crap are some people difficult to understand! I can 100% pick out and understand anyone with a Cork accent though!
Scottish accent sounds like a "forced laid back" kinda attitude.... like "that's just the way the world works." w/ the high pitch always begging your sympathy 'nd understandin.
Irish is like the Bavarian of English lmao
Thsi video is like how Germans feel when our accent gets reduced to "Oh jaja wat ze fuck"
Jack:"Oi....Oi it is Ireland" Jack in the rest of the video "Oiwrland"
I’m Irish I wish I had a accent though
“Eat shit France” seán 2020
At this point in the video I'm starting to understand what they're saying perfectly.
kinda same :D
I wish I was Irish, American accents are so flat and boring  Edit: Not because they're the sexiest
i had an irish teacher and to me at least she was indecipherable maybe because it kinda melded with the australian accent overtime(hehe me upsidown vegimite man) but honestly sometimes we had to tell her to slow down because no one could understand her
Mirrrrrrrrrrrrrrr. Spot on.
I heard "be sausaged with love"
Me from Ireland : understands everything W H A T?
I can recognize that accent by hearing the word "mushroom". It kinda sounds like moo-shroom :D
When women speak in an Irish accent Its pretty sexy.   Men...  Not so much xD
I get it.   I hate when people say something is an "American" accent.   Like...  which one?   People in Louisiana sound like they are from Mars compared to people in Boston.
Brad Pitt's accent was spot on lol, he's a traveller/gypsy from Ireland, that's exactly how they sound.
I'm half irish half scottish :v
I mean I would think the Irish accent is probably one of the most wide spread and known accent but I like that Georgian accent
East Texan here. My boyfriend makes fun of how I say “fire”  if I’m not careful it comes about “far”
Woah to hear my last name be said :000
you don't count jack
It’s funny when you aren’t realizing that these accents are the last Mogikans of Irish... It’s really sad...
Jack irish interpreter.
i'm canadian, can you do a video exploring east coast canadian accents? delightful joyous lilts connected to the old world, seasoned by the harsh canadian snow xo
alavyuuu AAaaaAaaaAaAa
Let's be real, nobody thinks an Irish accent is sexy. Don't fool yourself lol
Irish and Jamaican is kind of similar in a way
Im part irish but do not speak a lick of irish
Oml their terrible 🤣🤣
To be fair, in snatch, they even say, "it's not Irish, it's not English, it's pikey"   So I guess he wasn't supposed to do a normal Irish accent, but one that was barely comprehensable!
I love when Scottish and Irish people say “get f***ed” and “eat sh**” and “f*** me sideways”
"Start drinking more milk bitch"- Sean 2020, honestly ima go tell a baby this now.
Jack trying to talk like Christoper walking sounded like Arnold with a voice crack
I love being Irish
If your English teacher tells you that your pronounciation is wrong, just say it's Irish.
I’ve been to Ireland and it was absolutely beautiful! Unfortunately at the time I was going through a tough time and couldn’t enjoy it to the fullest so I hope I get to go back someday.
That sheep herder sounds like he's German or swëdish or something
Whenever you ask a non-American female to do an American accent, they always do valley girl. "Like oh my god, right?"
Old guy; "sojbw ridjhw fijebdzj skow"  Me; " hmm yeah I see what he's saying."
The hell is a feard gowel? Like I feel like it's an insult but I can't stop laughing
This is pog I'm from ireland
Christopher Walken doing an Irish accent is just like Sean Connery doing the accent for a middle ages Spanish noble to a Belgian playing a Scottish highlander
HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!! FARTY FIVE!!!!!!!
What fucking study is that?? irish is NOT generally considered sexy right 😂😂
You should react to irish people try ☺️
Bro it sounds like someone took a clip of them talking and played it in reverse with that frostbit clip
in ireland its not west its wesht its not gardai its NgArdai
Irish names: LOWERCASE t
When Sean said "Irish Rovers" I instantly thought of the guys who did the civil war songs
Seán, I would love to see you react to The Boondock Saints. I think that would be cool.
Eat shit France  "Jacksepticeye 2020"
Surprised Boondock Saints wasn't in here. Even more surprised that Snatch was. That's not Irish, that's gypsy, no?
Sean looks like brad pitt
hi just a random northern irish person
I laughed so hard, all I heard was dhjsggjs ghduioendh ttegdgjksv
*“Oilarnd”*
Jack should watch Foil Arms and Hog's Regional Accent Discrimination video
I am actually more shocked by the fact that jack can actually understand and translate that
the translation was impressive
The school boy is called Ruairì McSorley
Good.*
"FrostBUT."
Sometimes when I talk really fast I accidently do an Irish accent.  Maybe something I picked up as a child, as my family is Irish.  But when I try to do an Irish accent , I sound like an Indian (red dot) gas station attendant.
I have a mix of Scottish and Irish in me and yet...  I have no accent
This was fun- I feel so ✨dumb✨
Reminds me of the auction scene in the original roots series
Farmer sounded like German
I used to be able to do a really good accent as over 3/4 of my family is from Ireland but since I'm in the midlands I kinda lost it :(
I love the auto generated captions so much
i literally know the frostbit boy this is so fucking weird to see him on jacksepticeye's channel......
The very last animated clip on Irish accents is 100% spot on 🤣🤣🤣.  Besides the South Dublin one , we're not all fart sniffing poshies. Hahaha
My families Cork accent is by far the greatest accent there is
The way he talks about the south Irish guy is the way Kentucky talk about eastern mountain Kentucky people 🤣
Kinda Sus, that you got "Kinda sus" on your board
You should here my grandad
So VERY cool. We in Russia have a lot of accents too. For example wherever I go in Russia or Ukraine or Belarus everyone will recognize my Moscow accent. Anyway, thank you for this gorgeous video.
The Irish rowers are from my town, skibbereen, fine lads! Xd
Brad Pitt doing a nacker impersonation is very underrated 😂
The best “fake” accent I’ve heard was Sean Bean in Patriot Games. If you didn’t know he’s from Yorkshire you would think he was from Northern Ireland.
If I remember correctly Brad Pitt did say that that accent was deliberate. It was done purposefully to obfuscate.
Okay so Mickey is a Traveler not just Irish. But yeah it’s intense
WTFARMER. I'm officially wrecked after this
How to speak in cursive
You seriously stop right as they're about to do a donegal accent which was the Irish accent actually voted the sexiest in the world????,not happy😑
Brad Pitt in Snatch is one of my favourite things ever; he actually spent time with travellers to try and get the accent and mannerisms down.
To be honest I thought Scottish was some form of Irish and the other way around
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
what is he saying i am irish and i cant understand
Why did the sheep in the video have pink & blue on there wool?
I can't imagine Ireland have different accent in each town ... In Russia it's the same Russian all around, not big differences. Even in neighbor postsoviet countries it's very same
I have never been more happy to be part Irish than I am when watching you react to these
English is Not my native language and to me the sheep guy  does not sound like he’s talking in English anymore. I’m German and we, too, have a lot of accents that are really hard to understand.
1:53. My lovely horse...
Northen Ireland is a 100 years old today....don't know if I should be celebrating or setting something on fire
Me and my family are from Northen Ireland but my mum used to live in cork when she was a teenager and when she gets drunk she for some reason goes super cork
I like how they just have ‘English’ accent to cover every accent in England. 🤣🤣
can you speak galiege?
I understood more of the thick accents than I thought I would and I don't know how or why
snatch is such a good movie
kinda sus
I’m American and there are some Americans that I cannot understand a word coming out of there mouth 😂. It’s funny to hear other countries have the same struggles
I honestly never knew limerick was a place.
Don furgit ta lick da veedo xD
I went to Ireland (Cork) for work and I thought I knew english well. Turned out I needed to learn it all over again :D It was fine after few months, but then a guy form Kerry started working with me. Never understood a word he said, which was always awkward
If Christopher Walken wants to sound Irish he just has to mention that he don't know what things mean, but Grandma's got Arthritis.
I could barely translate 20 words out of that guys words
Brad pit played a gypsy in snatch come on sean
7:43 no dude lol, I understand every word you say
The people who are talking that you can’t understand they are called Irish travellers I am also an Irish traveller I close realise that because I’m told me this and I understand every bit of word of it
The only actual Irish person in the whole damn movie (Wild Mountain Thyme) was Jamie Dornan! lmao
I’m Irish and I couldn’t understand my grandad because ho spoke gibberish
I do love irish accent! Probably one of the reasons I like to watch Jacks videos.
Actually it new Zealand
far and away with tom cruise and nicole kidman
Wait a minute. Were they speaking English?
You have a slight Irish accent for an Irishman
In Ireland, accents get thicker the further south you go... Well, the same applies to the US. I'm from the southern state of Arkansas, but my accent is slightly different because of influence from learning other languages. I think the deepest a US accent can get is Georgia.
As an Irish person I can confirm I don’t sound like an American on steroids
Bruh its so ezzy 2under stand him tbh
Seans christopher walking is amazing
Brad Pitt’s Irish is good enough to sound Irish but sounds nothing like the Irish at the same time
"Are you going to say FlOuR and SoUr" Lol we say it like that up near the North
He sounds Japanese
6:27 How... can I understand what he's saying? And I have auditory processing disorder and I'm getting the general gist of this stuff. HOW?
Jack you do say oi a lot instead of i
I got so surprised when you mentioned Ballyhaunis
8:07 woah i understood that, i guess being newfie does help.. our thick accent is even more of a fuckery cause we got scottish in us aswell
im a newfoundlander and our accent is like southern mixed with irish and scottish (ancestors and shit confusing) but, our accent is a clusterfuck and i find it interesting
For any Irish person who has ever seen the first season of the spin of the hit TV show, Buffy The Vampire Slayer, Angel, is Doyle's accent okay? I didn't bother to see if his actor was even American, I just want to know if Irish people don't like his accent.
The Snatch quote that tries to justify Brad Pitts accent:  "it's not irish, it's not english... It's just, well, you know... It's just, pikey"
Is that the son of Ian Paisley?..jeez
I was on online class while watching this and I almost laughed lol
As a person with a tang of an accent, he sounds like he is speaking Gaelic....
Scottish is third place in sexiest accents  *Sad Fergus noises* sorry Fergus
I can't tell the difference between Irish and Scottish accents
I laughed so much when he sad .. Soiourrrrrrrrr , iourrrrr ,
I am from the southeastern United States, and I love Jacks accent.
In Gerard Butler's defense, he did appologize perfusely for his horrible Irish accent (being a Scotsman) and only did it because, when in Ireland, they were quite acceptant and offered him a pint for trying.
Its 3:50 am ... im dying yet again. Im probably waking up my parents
How she said “home, blown and stone” legitimately reminded me of Mrs Doubtfire. Just me oh well
8:14       i dont know what that means but grannys got arthriti-
You do know that Christopher Walken's real name is Ronald from New York.
I can't do an Irish accent or Scottish accent and neither can these people
And here I was, thinking I mastered English as a second language and even understand accents well... welp, I guess there is much more to learn
I always wish I could see Ireland. It was the first and only place in this world I ever wanted to see before I die. Probably never going to happen though.
It's like a sentence without any space
Is shrek irish?
I knew very little english when coming to Ireland at the age of 12, and take a wild guess where I landed? yes, the kingdom itshelf 😭 But still, Kerry is one of the most beautiful places in the world so in my heart there’s nothing but love.
5:32 sounds like a line from an anime
That deep Irish shepherd sounded more Skandinavian to me, lol.
the sheep one is like npc dialogue in a really shitty oblivion ripoff
Scottish accents out way Irish in my opinion
I’m Irish
skrek
I love the fact that I'm irish and I could understand what he sayed 🤣
Southern Ireland for me
Have a bit of fun: turn on closed captioning and see what the robot thinks yer saying.
I can fake an Irish and Scottish accents sometimes they end up fused.
Why does that irish schoolboy sound like a 54 year old professional darts commentator?  Also, what are you talking about there's not just a single Irish accent? Everyone knows that there are a total of three accents throughout the British Isles: Received Pronunciation, Cockney and Irish/Scottish (Interchangeable) /s
3:40 This reminds me of the shadow of tyre episode where Arcadum takes with that accent where no one can understand except for on player.
Struggled with the first farmer but did okay with the others, got a few key words. But then I'm Australian, not American and I feel like there is at least *some* overlap in accent sounds.
I'm watching this in vr
I'm Irish and I can't even understand this one
I’ve lived in cork county most of my life and I thought the north was always much harder to get 😂 😂 😂
the farmer was actually easy to understand lol
Fr0zt buTt
He should react to Jin from Yu Yu Hakusho.
Jack: Fuck you italy! Me: Come osi! siamo anche sexy
The Irish accent makes me go:🥵🥵🤪🤪🤪😏😏😏😩😩😩
tá mo chaoirigh ar iarraidh (my sheep are missing in Gaelic)
i say mirrrr the same way 🇺🇸
'Go back to bed and drink some milk, bitch!' I couldn't breathe for like 5 minutes!
"The MOST sexies-GET FUCKED ITALY"
I aprecciate this video
My uncle has such a THICK Irish accent that my entire family need him to write what he says down. WE ARE ALL IRISH! This is bad right?
Bro u sound like Irish gru from dispicibal me
Is it just me or can you just complete understand the Irish sheep man
19:11 ok for a moment I thought I heard Terroriser. Now I wonder which part of ireland he came from.
I like that people can understand you
Thanks for this video. I laughed so much my face hurts 😂😂😂
The fact that he laughs at his own joke makes it even better 🤣
Being from Texas I can sympathize with people failing at trying to do your accent. Most people mess up with the words that certain accents use.
I sort of understood the farmer the more. I listened
when jack said drink milk i thot of dani karlson o what is karlson ITS JUST A GAME DANI WOKING WISH NOW
I made out “lost” “bright” and “mountains” throughout all of that
I can understand the famer's accent, I live in Ireland
that man was speaking simlish
You should do a video on Irish spellings; gCities, dTowns, names, sobhnds, etc...
The world: “millions are dying from covid!” Ireland: “we ‘ave a fahermer missin bout fortah fayive sheep”
I honestly genuinely thought "Top o' the mornin' " was literally just a Jack thing
Holy hell that translation was IMPRESSIVE! and no, you dont sound like that, your accent could easily be fake.
Okay I’m from cork and can understand the cork swimmers or whatever, but the sheep guy is something else. I have an uncle John in the country outside bandon, and he’s absolutely unintelligible. The vocal coach hurt me soul
Me watching Sean: “Oh, Irish people aren’t that hard to understand.”  Me watching this video: “......whatdidhesayyyyy”
Wiled mountain thyme was filmed in Co Mayo
Brad Pitt is supposed to be an Irish traveler. Is their accent different? Genuinely asking
Kerry gang
The dislikes are from [insert_group_here]
I could understand most of them,  just a few words i couldn't get
I haven't watched alot of you're videos in a while but I noticed the intro is gone... wtf jack... what went wrong.. I dont get the top of the morning no more... now I'm sad 😭
I’m from Galway and once we had a teacher from Northern Ireland come down, She had such a thick accent, and I was shocked I could barely understand but was too embarrassed to ask.
Glaswegian lad: nobody can understand my accent. Not even other Scottish folks.  Kerry farmer: hold my sheep!
I wonder how the accents in Boondock saints are
How've you never seen the frostbit boy omg !! 🤣 Also the last vid of the cartoon of yer man with the spar bag was for The Rubber bandits lol :) had a good laugh at this 🤣
I love Irish women so I can testify that the Irish accent is the sexist in the world.
I'm weak!! >XD
As a non English native speaker I'm impressed how much i understood
Farmer sounded almost welsh
I am Finnish, grew up in Belgium, went to an international (american) school and uni in Scotland - where I worked at a bar and people would not believe me I was not Irish. Kinda odd but hey.
nooo sho wmore of that last video it was gold xD
Jack: that girl is not from Kerry. That is not a Kerry accent.  Looks up a video to show what a Kerry accent sounds like.   Shows us every every Irish accent but Doesn’t show us what Kerry accent sounds like.  I meant I could just look it up myself but still.
7:26 “Sean mac n cheese high” is correct way to say it
in Snatch, Brad Pitt plays a Gypsy not an Irishman....
Well I dunno what any of those words mean. All I know is granny’s got arthritis.
The movie in the beginning, I watched with my grandma. Even she said it was terrible, and confusing. The guy said he was a honey bee and the girl asked him if he was gay. 3/10 movie would not watch again
I find it hilarious when none Irish people can’t understand Irish my dad had a very thick farmer accent and I even have to translate for some of my Irish friends I would love an American to here my dad speak
jack: try to guess what he’s saying  me, five seconds in: 👁👄👁 ...what
I was drinking milk when he said that and I put my cup down 😂😂😂😂😂
yay im  sexy then
Mr. Sheep Farmer is tripping me out, he sounds Norwegian but it's just not computing haha
Where's your accent from? It sounds fake
Nah Jacks accent is a bit country side BUT! sure didn't he study at 5-lamps  close to sheriff street.  No doubt that gave country Jack the ability to buy drugs in at least 7 languages some of them not even human.
he was explaining that the Divine Comedy by Dante Alegeira, William Shakespeares complete works and the Iliad  Homer are good reference for writers.
the second dublin girl was the best out of them all. Although Jack is better
thumbnail: I can't understand this guy video: I'll interpret for you don't worry.
It sounds like a completely different language! Woah! Im amazed its beautiful!
Something just randomly popped into my degenerate head - Is there an Irish porn industry? Yeah, I don't think I've even heard anybody on porn sporting an Irish accent. Huh.
That ne with Caravan Talk. I'm an American and even I think it's bad.
I totally didn't use the "How to do an irish accent" for a DND character
When it comes to Cork there's one lad ta turn to
that girl from northside dublin rlly doin it for me
I think jack needs to take note from some of theses videos lol 😂
Brad Pitt and his band weren't playing Irish folk.  Those were Tinks (allegedly)!
is nobody gonna talk about the video that seán got recommended after the sheep video?
hey just a quick question for all of the irish lads  what's 26+6
Brad Pitt/ Mickey was a gypsy traveller not really oIrish and as Turkish explains, they speak a strange Barely English language that's almost impossible to understand
I didn't understand anything but I died at farty five sheep hahahah. I thought my accent was bad lol
Cork is the best place in Ireland end of
andyuhwudntwunttogitfrosbut
I laugh every time I watch Jack, and then watch That Chapter.  they're both Irish, but they don't sound the same (unless Jack's playing with his Irish buddies.  then the accent is stronger, but still not quite the same).  Jack says, "three", TC says, "tree".  but I love them both.
I'm part irish... just saying 😌 🤷
As an Irish person I feel like *yes*
he'll never see this.. but see if this irish man can understand a think newfy accent
I got an add with an Irish lady and I thought is was apart of the video
When jack said he was Christopher walkin trying to be Irish not he was Christopher walkin trying to be terminator
I think Jacks accent is top in this video
What really throws me is that their lips BARELY MOVE. Are all the Irish actually ventriloquists??
When it got to the farmer who'd lost his sheep I put on auto generated subtitles and it was quite something
y do they think Ireland is always sunny
Seriously, the only Irish accent I have heard ever in media is from the character Finan from the show The Last Kingdom. And I find it really distinct.
I need jack to be my translator if i go to ireland
Jack didn’t even recognise blindboy
fORTy five is how americans say it... jack: farty five
I honestly love irish accents
I love that you can hear that english is a germanic laguage clear as day. It sounds like Platt. Ike us in westfalen in germany other germans are happy we actuly get complete words out when they speaking to us
It's the Dublin ascent that sexy,,, ps lam from Dublin😜😜😜
15:12 is this the unreleased song that played in the background of the lackadaisy stream a while back
So the term limerick as in dirty limerick is named after an Irish town ?
Surprised there's no clips from Sons of Anarchy... Has some terrible Irish accents lol
5:32 - I've got no idea what the man is saying. Yes, Sean, thicc accent is RIGHT!
Is it illegal to move your lips when you speak in Ireland? Lol
That was a spot on Christopher Walken. Lmao 😂
How do you guys talk without moving your mouths?
the farmer talking:hewnkewrngli jack:he said an edge is an edge
I feel like Irish is the danish of English languages. It just kinda reminds me in its own way of that
Sean, as a Scottish person from an underrepresented region accent wise, thank you. Every town in my county has different forms of the same dialect, so nobody sounds the same. Scotland much like Ireland has dozens of different accents, there’s not just one accent.
aah boh ahspoz Yes, I suppose.
Just seeing sean slowly put on a smile on his face as he listens to other irish speakers just warms my heart
I cannot believe I could understand every word of the Kerry Farmer. I’ve never heard an accent like that before.
Why is the "how to do an irish accent" lady using a bad American (California area probably) accent as if it's her natural accent? It sounds like she suppressing a watered down Dublin accent. I know someone who's from Dublin and has lived in the US (Massachusetts) for 20 years and the woman in the video sounds like she's hiding the same transatlantic accent the woman I know has.
apparently, if you are 70% English, 25% Scottish, and 5% welsh then you can do a flawless Irish accent
when you realise Sean has over FIVE TIMES the number of subscribers as the Republic of Ireland has people.
2:15 how LGBT+ people feel when they cast straight people for LGBT+ parts
Have a good dragon, Fortnite some moonshine night
“Irish people, you’re great.” No Sean, you Irish people are grand. 😂
How can I understand this?!
That wasn't so haaaaaard.
A bunch of my ancestors on my mom's side are from Ireland and now I wanna know where from! So I can imagine what they sounded like and what the history is from there.
at 4:01 that is a irish gyspsy irish accent alot of travallers and gamon people speak like that 9/10 you catn even understand a word there saying
no such thing as a county louth accent, dundalk accent is the most unique one in ireland
Do a reacting to scottish junkie accents. That'll be a laugh.
Y
'ya smell like burnt potatoes!'    'Potatoes!'
I understand you perfectly, Jack.
I'm Irish too
It does get a little hot in my house when your accent gets a lil thick when you yell. Just sayin
0:24 "Get f*cked Italy!!!"             how many other ppl had to pause so they could change their knickers/boxers
Jacks accent is definitely the best Irish accent :') also, I'm from the north of England and the amount of videos of people trying to do a norther accent is ridiculous, and they're all shocking :)
Brad pitts accent is meant to be an irish traveller in england. I have known many irish travellers and they have a different accent to the irish.
Then some parts Dublin you'll find  the  howya girlies
Jack when he tried to recreate his Irish accent he sounded like gru from minions
Im from lithuania but i moved to ireland since i was only a couple months old and some people that speak my language are suprised at how Irish my accent is my teachers would always say you couldnt tell i was lithuianian unless you found out my name and the fact im blonde not to many blonde heads out here mainly gingers :)
5:10 this man isn’t speaking the accent, he speaking the whole language.
"Laughs in irish"
Ngl that one accent impression sounded just like you jack
Look I'll take 3rd place
I want an Irish accent
The zippy berry regionally transport because eggnog geographically discover a a spooky air. graceful, rabid trowel
Ah yes, the two genders. Run in field with arms out and ride horse
Jack obviously doesn't have much experience with the "pikey" accent that Brad pitt was doing. Its not a regular irish accent like Jack says. Travellers are literally considered a separate ethnic group and Brad pitt actually did a good job of it
As someone with family in Cork this video is soo funny! 😂
the north and south sides are bang on tho
Scottish is my favorite accent but irish is a close second
sean's accent is like a perfect mixture of all accents in the areas he's been to most, so he sounds american at times to me (an american) an then british at times and then irish and then some shit that i cant even place
NAH WHY TF IS SCOTISH THE 3RD SEXEST HUGUGSFGUFGIGKJBV
i think i speak for a lot of ppl when i say we love your accent.
The peoples republic Oh no
Jack imma be honest.... can you just tell me to drink more milk for like ever now.... no reason or anything.....
I am from Norway, and I am pretty shocked I understood most of it, even the sheep farmer! LOL
He sounds German for some reason
The Olympic guys were pretty easy to understand
Dublin ascent is very different to the rest of Ireland
Shows first video   "It doesn't sound Irish at all"  Me: sounded Irish to me🤣🤣  Edit: I like Irish news better, tired of hearing "another mass killing" "police dead" "child's body found"
Is it bad I can understand bits of that strong Irish accent and I'm from the North of England
17:30 as a British person myself that was amazing 10/10
Report Negative Comments Trust Me
Can I just say that last video was NOT a south Dublin accent, made me sound like a fucking D4 head, like I sound much more like what they said was the northern Dublin accent, but I’m born raised in south
3:17 is that Jason Statham?
All English sounded like the farmer when I was still learning it lmao
I love how he stopped the last video as it looked like it was about to talk about Northern Ireland. Like hmmmmmm, kinda sus
You’re not the only country to suffer from the movie accent thing! They should cast Australian actors for Australian characters because everyone else sounds ridiculous trying to do the accent!
As an American, his accent doesn’t sound very strong at all like I don’t notice it that much unlike most Irish accents I hear
I know this video is months old and you probably won't see this, but the little cartoon dude for the Limerick section was (I'm 99% sure) a reference to The Rubberbandits, a comedy music duo from Limerick city who wear balaclavas made from plastic bags. They're fucking hilarious if you haven't heard of them before. Check out Hey Mister, Are You A Hipster Or A Hobo?; Horse Outside; or I Wanna Fight Your Father.
Vowel Bender got me XD Like
This is my jacksepticeye comfort video
One thing on my bucket list Is to visit Ireland but its so pretty ive been concidering moveing there. If any irish people see this, do you recomend liveing in ireland aposed to the US? As a side note i do have some irish ansestry but i dont know if that matters.
Fish
This is just for me, so go on your way 18:14
I have seen the Irish rowers in Graham Norton before. They know that they can be hard to understand 😂
Táim ag iarraidh Gaeilge a fhoghlaim. Tá an Ghaeilge i bhfad níos deacra ná blas na héireann.
Jack does a better Christopher Walken accent than Christopher Walken does of an Irish accent.
I'm scouse and I completely understood what that man was saying 😂😂 We do have a very big Irish community in Liverpool though so I guess that could be why? 😅😂
I think he’s speaking the traditional Irish language
Yes jack irish people are built different
Es mejor México mágico
As an Englishman you know it’s gonna be a good party when there’s an Aussie, a Scotsman and an Irishman. You’ll probably get given a load of grief but god it’ll be funny
thank god he found raury mcsorely
IRELAND
The Irish acent is the most sexiest and you’re a great example
I love the Irish music.
2:21, Jack is now Arnold whateverhislastnameis
In fairness in think that farmer is probably a native irish speaker
Why did this video just skip every accent North of Dublin. Like you skipped 3/4 of the most prominent accents in Ireland and instead focused on a few counties with minor differences. Appreciation for Connacht and Ulster 2021 😂
Flower more like flare 11:50
7:05 I have such a hard time understanding and I'm m Irish
I wish more people knew a little Norwegian to appreciate our weirdass accents/dialects as well. I can think of five distinctive ways of saying I and not, that sounds like completely different languages.
I'm a vowel bender LOL and then the arrow 🤣🤣 and then you sounded like God damn Gilbert Gottfried 😂😂
I could actually understand some of what the Olympian said somehow
Hey! Hey. hey... that's Jamie Dornan in the thyme one. He can hold his body parallel to the ground - whoops on 'is dielick... He's either Irish or Scottish... Cork is great
Jack: starts to translate Also Jack: starts to get into the accent and we lose him
you wouldn be afraid of gettin frosbutt
snatch a classic and the ascent is a Irish traveller not irish
"Irish is the sexiest accent"     *Yes*    Edit: btw I am irish too.
Man, you are annoyning...
5:00 he's like the Swedish Chef but Irish
Fun fact: some of my relatives that randomly turn up at my family reunions sound like that sound like that southern farmer 😂
I thought Brad Pitt played a Gypsy..
It’s annoying that jack keep trying to be superior with the Irish accent
You need to look at Newfie accents. I actually only had a little difficulty with most of these, and some not at all, because I've heard Newfie accents made fun of all my life and I currently have a Newfie boss (who only has an accent when he's talking to another Newfie).
you know, i was actually starting to understand by the end if it.
Brad Pitt plays a Traveler, not an Irishman. smh.
"declared the sexiest accent"  by who the lollipop guild?
I swear the Irish are the country British
hope his sheep are fine
I've lived in Cork for 16 years and I've heared some cursed asf dialect.
0:24 wise choice of words
2:22 lol it's that guy from fifty shades of grey 😳😂
I think I got about half of that farmer's words and I feel like a *god*
When people try your accent... They  end up doing ours... The Scottish accent and it really annoys me
I wish I had an Irish accent
What is the most complicated language in the world BTW?
All I understood was “full moon tonight” from that old dude
12:25 same with America, each region and sometimes states have slightly different accents, it's probably the same in most countries
i undestand a whole lot of squat of irish accent hahaha
As an American watching an American "teaching" how to do an Irish accent: *all the fucking cringe*
farty five? xdd
Jack:so funny Me:what the fuck he says
Brad Pitt had the uncanny valley Irish accent
7:14 must be tom hanks twin
im English
This video is freaking hilarious. Thank you Jack.
*sees Australia as number 5* *Sean starts working his way down the list insulting other accents* Me: you be’er not cunt, you be’er fuckin’ not. *sean stops at france* Me: “good shit. Gooooooood”
frostbit lad is a diffrent breed the breed of a tinker
I love this vid lmao
You know who's Irish? Scrooge McDuck in the new Duck Tales 😉  And that dude from Harry Potter
I thinks thats great , i love the diferente ways a single lenguage can be , like here in México we speak spanish but almost every state and región   got their own spin to it , idioms, slang and jargon thats what makes a lenguage great
Is that bad that as the video went on i became able to understand it? That's wild.
That guy sounds like Boom Howard from "King of the Hill".
You talk perfect jack🖤
I thought my dads accent was bad, I'm never asking my father to repeat what he just said again...
“I’m fuckin- I’m great at this!”   -Irish man learning an Irish accent
Why do I hear a similarity between Irish and Jamaican?
I have NO idea the fuck just happened... And I love it... And I need MORE
me who is from meath in ireland i can barely understand that man
You should hear Drunken Old Western Prospector Gibberish (even though it was a joke in Blazing Saddles, there were old prospectors who talked like that sober)
totally you sound like the little leprichaun from the lucky charms and darn straight ill buy your cofffeee
I'm from kerry and I understand him perfectly its funny that ye can't understand a thing he's saying🤣
Arnold be like
So we can safely say. We can understand English. It's just the accents that screwed you over
Why you sound like a leprechaun?
Is Cork where all the Nuns are from? That woman was awful stern considering what she was there for and her age.
Irish the best
I can imagine with everyone wearing masks that there is nothing heard but a faint mumble in Southern Ireland
I'm pretty sure Brad Pitt's accent was supposed to be very hard to understand, for the sake of stereotyping rather than accuracy
Brad pitts accent isnt quite irish, ...its pikey, i could swear it says that in the film lmao, ....and the farmer sounds like a character from father ted lmao
Your Christopher Walken impersonation is spot on!
cork accent
The "Irish People Watch" guys gave Brad Pitt some credit for the accent too.
lmao... Im a vowel bender...im dying
I love how his Irish accent gets progressively stronger the further into the video you watch
The sheep farmer learned how to speak in Sim
My cousin just for married to an irish guy. I did their maternity pictures and the whole time he was trying to talk i was just like.....what was that? Hilariously my shitfaced boyfriend who was helping me with my equipment understood every single word.
i can only understand the videos cuz of my grandad i have to translate everything
At least he said he was sorry for sounding the way sounds farty five sheep that's a lot of sheep that's literally what you sounded like dude farty five.
hahah
Do you know actual irish language?  There is a video titled can irish people speak irish? React to that.
What the hell, I'm Dutch and I understood about half of the farm guy and 90% of the other ones
The farmer said how could someone take the sheep during a full moon it’s too bright
Was she doing a northern Irish accent when saying I
I tried to do an Irish accent for a D&D character once. I wanted to play a joke where I was this big hulking Hobgoblin War Mage with a non-threatening, high-pitched Irish accent.   It sounded more like a mix between Irish and Scottish.   ... i tried at least.
Stab city damn you got ur own liverpool
Dude, you sound like RP English after listening to Sheep Guy.
I have a cousin who left Ireland for America when he was 7. He has no trace of his accent left except when he is plastered drunk. His accent comes in so clear, you'd wonder if he ever actually left! The funniest thing to witness.
Not gonna lie the Irish accent kinda deserves that title. It’s such an energetic and fun accent.
The Cork accent of the O'Donovan boys sounds like the exact origin of the Jamaican accent. It's incredibly interesting, but if you transport your brain to a reggae song, you'll understand exactly what they're saying.
to be honest i think my favorite is county wicklow, and as a bonus, one of my favorite wrestlers (finn balor) is from there. i think thats where ronnie neville is from too cuz he has the same accent
'Bad' Irish accents? Wow, how does that soup taste, Jack?
No our NZ accent is the most sexy and exotic.
are u frm whestmeath
In that movie Jamie Dornan Irish I believe he’s from Nothern Ireland
So the Facts channel is now the Try Channel. Most of the same people are there including the guy in that video John Sharpson. Him and his brother Donal are just fantastic. Incredibly funny.
I remember the first time I had a really english conversation. In Panama we study english since kindergarten but it's never taken so seriously. There I was in Turkey, after a month of full english exposure. I could communicate somehow and then someone from Pakistan came in and talked to me... I was like... Noooo this is the final boss.... I was totally wrong after I saw the irish sheppard.
11:51 he turned into someone from armagh
I gringed so hard to this
Only the first sentence from Kerry was accent'ed
What da fuck Jeff!!!
"they seem to speck a couple octaves higher than the rest of the country 😂😂😂
Aight
* RACIST *
I’ve no idea why; but so many of my internet friends really like my accent and I’ve no idea why 😂 bare in mind I’m from Northern Ireland and to me our accents are some of the most annoying lmao
Snatch just sounds like brad pitt slipping in and out doing a bad irish accent and doing a bad impression of Ian MacDowell's cockney accent from A Clockwork Orange. I mean I can't be the only one who hears mostly cockney.
it’s is good or bad that i can understand everything they were say😭
Sean explaining how Irish accents vary from town to town is exactly how I feel when people try to do an "italian" accent and then they just do a bad Naples accent.
Thick Irish accents, a reminder that Gaelic is a thing.
I'd actually like to learn how to do an Irish accent. I'm part Irish, but I was born and raised in America. I currently have a voice I'm not very fond of and want to be able to change it to something that makes me feel more comfortable with myself, and I thought trying to adapt an Irish accent to my voice might help me with that. At least attempting to learn an Irish accent with give me a fun voice I can use in a Dungeons & Dragons game if I end up failing to adapt it to my actual voice.
Irish not wanting to say top of the morning to you is like British people not wanting to say skittles
Ironic that you're slagging yanks doing Irish accents when your own accent has that Hiberno-California millennial Irish accent abomination. :D
I could only understand like 40% of what that dude was saying and I studied Ireland/Irish for 3 fucking darn years
I’m actually from Skibbereen, and I know the rowing lads quite well. Great guys to be around, funny fuckers. We’re all very proud to have them in the area.
forget watching the news. Irish news is my new go to now. By by CNN
I'm part British, Irish, Dutch, and Scottish and when I start talking fast all come out at once and so I stutter lol.  And I was born in America lol
The Irish farmer sounded like he was speaking an entirely different language
Does anyone else remember when like.... a berjillion years ago, Anglophenia did a trip around England, Ireland, Scotland, and Wales, via the accents, when the gorgeous Siobhan Thompson was still with them? I loved that video. It was the first time I really started wanting to try to learn all of the different accents crossed the pond. Now I'm addicted, and I still miss Siobhan Thompson.
Was just watching Mike of @That Chapter then suddenly I'm here. Kinda gettin' addicted w/ this Irish men. 🤣
Was just watching Mike of @That Chapter then suddenly I'm here. Kinda gettin' addicted w/ this Irish men. 🤣
I’m not a single percent Irish, but believe me when I say the Guyanese people at the pub are exact replicas of that farmer who lost his sheep, were so hard to understand when we’re hammered
"I'm a vowel bender" 😂😂😂😂 I lost it
The sheep guy sounds Danish or something
The funnest thing to say in an Irish accent it shit
What i heard from the farmer:   SHCNIKER ASHDFG
I watch jack so much I'm so used to his Accent that it sounds normal
Pitt wasn't playing Irish, he was playing Pikey. It's like an amalgam of Irish, Scottish, Welsh and Manx
5:30 “when they were out at night it was nearly a full moon, plenty bright out when a bunch of them when missin’, right up in the mountains
Jack looks like he's in sage mode
I'm from dublin and we all talk about 6000 miles per hour when we see someone from a different place they never understand us
"Ha ha eat shit france" jacksepticeye
Oh yeah man sure in a simplified irish Accent is said O ye mn shr
Jack: 'I'm a vowel-bender.'   Me: *screams at screen and dies of laughter*
I'm sorry I can't stand I'm stuck to the seat!     I have frostbutt!
I think Scott is just cross that people think the Irish accent is better than his American accent
Did anybody actually understand the guy who's sheep got stolen? Cuz I'm not convinced he was actually speaking english words
FARTY FOIVE SHEEP
5:11 what the actual fuck is he saying? It just sounds like "jwkkskksixnd"
I haven't heard Brad slur an accent so badly. Maybe it's on purpose.
Brad Pitt played a gypsy in England, that's why the accent is different 👍
Yeah I’m related to all those Kerry people
GOD, I LOVE MY PEOPLE :).  My dad was well within his rights to be pissed at me for not visiting Ireland when I lived in Europe.
So I’m wondering if people who immigrate to Ireland have a different accent and how long it would take for accent to catch
The one with the towns I can really relate to. It's the same with the 'bavarian' accents. I was born in Rosenheim but if you go like 10 kilometers from it. You can already find completely different pronouced words and other ways to refer to a word. Example the word bridge: "Bruckn'" or "Bruckal" (just two examples) with the word "Brücke" in the 'normal' german. So if anyone tells you there is one bavarian accent, don't believe them!
Hah! My husband and I went to Ireland years ago. Galway had heavier accents here and there but when we visited the Aran Islands?  The man with the horse and carriage was so nice...but we couldn't understand most of what he said. We kept up pretty well up to then.
i feel like jake should audition for this.
The "mad accent" kinda sounded welsh at some points
Video: How to do an Irish Accent  Me: Watch a hella lot of actual Irish movies and Sean, then mimic as best I can.
Yes because I’m a Texan
Hahaha I’m so used to watching your streams I almost replied to something like it was live 😂😂😂
f l u r
IDK why but I was LMAO at 0:42 and I was drinking milk
The way I hear Jack, his accent definitely comes out every other word, but sometimes he speaks a full sentence without an accent and rather speaks like a squeaky toy.  Sorry Jack, can’t help my terrible American ears being bad.
to me the Irish accent sounds like a crossover of the British and American accents, specifically southside Dublin, but my favorite is definitely cork
okay but can someone link that irsih channel please that was hilarious
10:41 I can't help to notice that you did not like the video, Sean. Why should WE be the only ones to like it, but you, yourself, are exempt somehow? I call sheep bollocks, old chap. Big dangly ones.
Are you wearing eye shadow?
BionicPig tried to imitate “Top of the morning” in his most recent video and he sounds British. It made me cringe
And here there are millions of people with a American accent
I totally agree, why not just hire Irish actors?
Snatch is the best movie. Up the irish!
you should react to eastern canadian accents
PLZ . Do on a review on your cousin from Canada , Newfoundland 🇨🇦 ☘️
was the one drawing a guy with the grocery bag on his head? rubberbandits? horse outside?
Alternate title: Jacksepticeye translates a whole different form of English
Snatch is a great movie tho
I'm from the US but I'm Irish and I can do an ok Irish accent lol..
The really strong Irish accents kind of sound like Jack when he used to say "high fives all around" in his old outro
Is it bad that I can understand what they're saying even though I'm not Irish
As an Englishwoman living in the States, I've yelled at the TV in this same manner many a time 😂
I almost completely understood sheep guy and I'm not Irish but I have a little help I am from Newfoundland
I love how I can understand them, my grandfather was born and raised in Southern Ireland and he had a thick hardcore Irish accent
The more I listen to Jack the less I hear his accent lol
Okay but why do I understand all of these crazy accents, I'm not even an English native speaker, but German lmao
Watches Wild Mountain Thyme trailer: Jack: "Why don't they just cast people that are Irish" Does not comment on the only person who has lived in Ireland and his accent (Jamie Dornan) rofl
I can understand that because Im Irish
My uncle is from carrik on suir tipperary. He mumbles, has a deep voice and a super thick accent. I had no idea what he was saying for the first solid 15 years of my life.  I stayed with them for a week way back when and finally worked it out and boy was I missing out. He's a hilarious dude.
i thought that the farmer was talking korean or smthing
Why no Irish actors? Because..... *MoNnNnnNnNNnNeEEeY*
I feel like Irish is the southern accent of American English.. I can't help but think of it like that lmao
I want an irish girlfriend. 🤤
why does it feel like irish is basically cursive
My mother said she didn't like hue so stop watching you but never
Brad Pit flat out played a trailer. And he did the travelers accent flat out PERFECT.
Sean mac an tsithigh 😺
😂😂😂😂😂😂
Frostbutt
I am from kerry and somehow I can actually understand But sometimes when I talk people I just nod and say ya cus I don't have a clue what they are saying
At least my country is fifth in the most sexiest accent-
I love how Christopher Walken doing a bad Irish accent sounds exactly like an Irish guy doing a bad Christopher Walken accent...
I'm from Tipperary & I think it's fair to say that it's a bit of a shame that our accent - like a good few distinct ones in Ireland e.g. Wexford, Donegal etc. - don't get featured at all in the clips shown above (maybe because it might sound too similar to the other accents down south in Munster...possibly!?).  Any who - thanks for translating that Kerryman Jack lol!
The thundering cent formally stain because mom postsynaptically fry concerning a male respect. lean, careful fireplace
I'm American but my mom's family is from Ireland and Scotland. I remember Great Aunties and Uncles would speak and all eyes would turn to my grandparents for translation. Now, I'm the one who translates for my husband and kids 😂😂😂
NO LUCK FIR YOU SCOTLAND?          Thats offensive Jack... thats offensive
« Eat shit France » *and I took that personally* 😂 anyway, I laughed way too hard for a night before an exam, it was relaxing, glad I found this video 😂
It would be good it Liam Neason was in one
Why do all of them sound like they are wasted? 🤣
Jesus Christ, that dude speaking Irish is like the Frysian of the Netherlands, complete gibberish.
Me: accent isn't 1st place Also me: "I'm behind him I'm still proud"
My "Irish" accent is more of a Scottish accent (It could be because im more scottish than irish but all I know about that is im part Irish, Scottish, American, and German.)
This was fantastic! Jack, your accent is the best, duh <3
All my family are originally from County Down and I used to find it so fun going back to Ireland hearing all my cousins accents
I live in Dublin. I love Ireland and all the accents too. Im not originally from here though. Im from northern Europe. Yeah, It was a lot of fun to watch this.
10:50 this woman needs to be fired the only time ive ever seen anyone sound like that was Judi Dench in Artemis Fowl. She's shite XD
Im so sad russian accent isnt even in the top 10 :(
Pains being bout 25 percent irish and it doesn't show anywhere accept for the pale skin 😣
Is was amazing and much needed 😂
This rabbit hole of a video is amuzing to watch as a person with ADHD
I'm Irish but sadly don't have a thick accent cause I live in Dublin
The Irish accent is a treasure that must be protected <3
Frost butt
Farty five sheep
12:30 I'm from the North West of England and my Dad is from about 8 miles up the road and sometimes I need a translator for the things he says. So things like "Are you alright?" - as a greeting is "y'hall-reet?"  Went out with woman who lived six miles away who told me once she had "edyarch" - meaning a headache.   I married a Canadian. Life is so much simpler lol
I keep reading things in my head with a bad Irish accent somebody help
Sean Mac Ant Sit High
That man who lost his sheep spoken 99% gibberish and I’m amazing and astounded at the fact that jack could translate that!
I cannot believe you didn't recognise the spar bag as being blindboy... for shame!!!
Wait wait wait       Did he not get the rubber bandits joke in the last video abt accents when it was limerick   Disgraceful
Even though ireland is around the same size as Louisiana there is more accents the America combined cuz theres 32 countys in ireland and the all have a  different accents annd some counties have more then one like in limerick you have the less harsh east limerick but then west limerick is full of culchies so its way thicker
im From Tipp and i honestly couldnt understand that farmer! Also Irish Accent Is the Swiss Army Knife of accent's
flour = flower tbh
The school boy has a song. Northern stars YouTube channel
Jack, "Go back to sleep BITCH!"
The one with sheep. The folks are like the Irish Boon Howard. From the TV show King of the Hill. Southerner here by the way. Accents can get deep here. Lol.
Have y'all ever watched far and away with Tom cruise its a good movie
Im asian and I'm grown up in Ireland too
here in denmark we also have the southern jutland accent or dialect i guess which me and a bunch of other people have a hard time understanding as well. it's basically southern irish but in danish. i understand basically nothing. why is it always in the south that the hard accents appear?
I'm ireish but I don't got a thick accent
I understood clearly from the second Irish farmer onwards 😅 although I have family in Southern Ireland so would explain it.
The way jack sounds like I just came out of a episode of Derry girls say flower
Me being german and cant even understand anything its for me kind of like swiss german 😂
I love these XD
Holy shit his Christopher Walken impression is incredible 😂
As a dual citizen sometimes I go to Scotland and I get into Glasgow and I feel like 😳😳 and I’ve been around since I was born
i from cork boi
They should have casted cillian murphy in Wild mountain thyme
Whale oil beef hooked
This is the sexest accent
7:26 that was cringy and funny name.😂
If you concentrate, you can hear words
2:20 you managed to make laugh so hard that it differed from my usual laugh, my laugh sounded different, and I don't even know how... Amazing.
Snatch is a great movie, hilarious!
As someone who's native language isn't English, Irish and Scottish are the two final bosses of accents.
for anyone seeing this make sure to check out 10:25 for some amazing advice
I’ve learned that jack has a bad Irish accent after this haha
Im used to watching videos on 1.75x speed and boy did I regret that with this one.
Plot Twist, Jack isn't Irish and it's just a put on voice
My other comment was part way through. Now I'm at 12:10  This chick omg. I can't do a perfect Irish accent. Mine comes out more Irish and Scottish combined. But omg mine is so much better than hers. Wtf
I know this is a bit of an older video but I'm watching it for the first time now. I really needed this. I'm American but this makes me laugh and connects to to my irish heritage at the same time. I'm had a hell of a morning and I needed this. Thank you
The fact Jack does a better Christopher Walken voice better than Christopher Walken can do an Irish accent is hilarious to me
The sheep farmer speaking made me feel like I was in one of those situations where someone’s speaking another language that you can’t understand but you pick up one a word here & there every now & again yet have no fucking clue what was said as a whole.
I'm irish-         Dundalk          And I have an accent-
I'm hearing "Frostbutt", not "frostbit"
15 “R”? I fucking died!! 😂😂
I am Irish and I don’t understand him that much but I can make it into sentences  Oh and can you react to the Irish people in twilight  Because it’s very bad because they aren’t even Irish and they speak with a American accent
He might be speaking irish?
Omg, hahahaaahha. I'm always having to translate scottish to my non-scottish pals but this is brilliant!
I recently learned Spanish. Then I met a dude from deep El Salvador.  Yea it's Spanish but in English terms... you think Lil' Wayne and Queen Elizabeth could communicate?
Is it weird that the more I watch this, the more I can understand them? Im scared
I live in Ireland I can't even understand this I live in louth in leister but I'm from ulster .
5:57 I just understood “sheep” 6:13 What The..,
when he doesn't know the rubber bandits. He ain't actually irish
Laughed so hard when he said "Farty-Five" I woke the baby up. So thanks for that.
I am concerned.. Why do I understand al of that 😂 I'm austrian xD.. Maybe because no one understands our accent too xD
yes i'm mostly irish
I'd imagine that English is second language for the Kerry farmers, Irish (Gaelic) being their first. They probably don't speak English on a daily basis and would be pronouncing everything through the Gaelic alphabet.
Brad Pitt sounded as if Jack Sparrow tried to be Irish...
Brad pits accent is just a Newfoundland accent
as someone from nroth dublin tha was a real knock hearing it from an ouside point of view hahHh like your man got it spot on din he
Subscribed for "Start drinkin' more milk, BITCH!"
The way that he talks. No other Irish person talks like that and NO ONE SAYS TOP OF THE MORNING
Brad Pitt's accent is not irish...is irish travellers...
I’m Irish and I could not understand a word that the guy with the sheep was talking about
scottish is far from a sexy accent
His Irish accent is so good you would think he's actually Irish
You do a better Christopher Walken than he does an Irish accent 😂
“GO BACK TO BED CHILD”
Brad Pitt wasn't Irish... he was a gypsy.
You need to listen to a broad Scottish accent and Doric bc u will prob not understand any of it ahahah
I dn't know if I'm the only one who wants this, but PLEASE do other videos on other accents around the world, like Spanish or Italian... (I'm just listing those two because they're the only ones I can think of at the top of my head, don't want to offend anyone)
I dislike the fact that I can't like this more than once.
The dog did a better accent
CORK-- it's always Cork for me
People with a thick Yorkshire accent are almost incomprehensible
I thought he was speaking a mix of German and French
How dare you
I'm just realizing that Irish vernaculars use a different phoneme than /r/ used in North American English.  It has a slight trill to it or something.
My auditory processing is pretty broken so the only word that I could understand from that farmer was "sheep."
It's funny how I'm from New York but understand these people perfectly, who knew the Irish blood was so tick.
I’m a vowel bender😂😂😂
"Music, you call it." xD
I’m Irish and I don’t sound like it
At 2:22 Sean sounds exactly like Arnold Shwartzenegger
I heard to much now the voice in side me head has an accent
0:20 onepoll most sexiest accent they surveyed 5000 men and women in Ireland which is the sexiest accent. 14:26 ok i changed my mind now she wins! :P
All American accents sound the same huh? European doesn't like how Americans make generalizations and then generalizes Americans. I can tell what county in Utah you're from based on your accent.
Well, Brat Pitts character isn’t just a Irishman, He’s an Irish Gypsy. Who intentionally speak so people can’t understand them.
0:40 the bed part was kinda funny :/
Is that Arabic? Tf?
me: Being Irish  Kerry man: *talking* Me: Relieved Jack said he would translate it for us  XD
Yes this is wat we do in Ireland pretend to be an airplane and slap horse bum
The start got me 😂 just …
so Cat is Cash ?
You want to hear some thick Irish accents look up Newfoundland dialects :). People in remote bays and towns here are a real challenge
we need to know what are your thoughts on the song another Irish drinking song by davincis notebook
i didnt know ireland had spar
Not sure if Seanie is in pain or loving it 😂
Fucking Vowel Bender shit got me hahahahahahahaha
I mean the thing is, whenever your learning an accent for film or TV or anything else really, there is such a thing as getting to specific and noodly with these things.
“Haha eat shit France” favorite jacksepticeye quote
Jack never met cait in his fallout series.
Oh Lord, I couldn't understand a word that gentleman was saying.
Brad pitt was doing a traveller accent, it’s not reaaaally meant to be irish
Thanks for transcribing the Minecraft Enchanting language, Sean.
My family’s from Waterford , it’s so funny listing to people think that all Irish accents are the same 😭
Oh god, story time. So, half my family is Barbadian, and the older generation is a little hard to understand, even though they speak English. I stayed alone with my step-grandmother when I visited and I just had no idea what she was saying most of the time,  My dad, who's originally from a different has had conversations with her, also has no idea what she's saying and just fakes it. My mom isn't sure sometimes, and even the mailman who comes to the door to deliver mail and knew her by name was clearly very confused. I thing the internet forced all english speakers' accents closer together.
eyyyy, the rowers are from Cork, thats where my ancestors are from!
Love from my heart
WHAT THE FUCK, JEFF
For some reason, Seán saying "Haha! Eat shit France." Is the best part of my day.
What about Northern Ireland country
My 100 year old Irish granddad comes from skibbereen
I really wish Jack would critique Boondocks Saints. I think they sound great, but I'm American so the Lucky Charms guy sounds legit to me 😂
You wouldn’t be wantin’ frostbit
Farty5 sheep were missing, not 45, get it right. XD
"start drinking more milk bitch"🤣😆👌
I would love for you to react to heavy Canadian accents, they have the same sing-song sounding like Irish.
he paused the trailer so perfectly it looked like the horse was floating
Thank you for this video. What? Irish accents aren't sexy? Yes, thank you for pointing out there are different accents.
Na Scottish acsent is the sexeist
Oh I didn’t know that the sims 4 characters were irish
australian accent > irish accent. cancel me
I'm glad sean's translating
I'm Irish and I cannot understand anything, is this a separate language??? Lmfao
I'm watching this in March, the perfect time to be Irish
This videos view nearly the population of republic of Ireland
You don't sound like that confusing man
Bad... Forced... Multiplied??? Accent is sometimes funnier than normal
But they understand each other though? 🤣
Im from cork so I could understand the o donovan brothers well and all the accents im used to hearing at this rate from going to gaa matches
Something I love is just how...how charmed Sean looks when they speak, how delighted he looks. Just tickles me!
jacks ears r just built different.
You know what's funny jack says drink more milk bitch me having milk right in front of my face already😅
I am BAFFLED he was able to understand the lovely farmer
Fartee five?
I NEED Jack to collab with Leather Jacket Guy and Irish Jesus from the "Irish People Try" channel.
Maybe coulda used Strong instead of "Bad".
Is nobody going to talk about one of  the video recommendations was “Irish farmer eats a sausage raw”
everyone - are u Scottish or IrIsH  me - did u just call me fucking Scottish go chug ur iron brew
as an Irish person I hate it when people try to do it
You should check out Newfie accents. I think  you might get a kick out of them. (A Newfie is someone from Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada)
I recommend reacting to "Johnny B and The Boogie Men " and to "The 2 Johnnies". They're pure Irish crack!  Also, love your videos. They're great!
This is your best vid Jack!!!
does anyone else notice Sean gets more Irish when he consumes Irish content
Does Jack not know what the spar bag on your mans head mean
5:50 I could understand “sheep.”
5:32 mans be speaking a whole different language like an asian language or som'
I had an Irish friend she said "the girl with the fair hair" and i had a no idea what she was talking about.
Oh gods! The Irishman that gets mad because theres no soup!
lol...wut?
Jimmy McGill - Better Call Saul
19:12: Ok! I GOTTA subscribe to this guy! XD
Why, why, why can't Hollywood get Ireland and the Irish accent{s} right. It doesn't cost that much to come here. Just travel around the Island, talk to various people in cities, towns and villages. And you'll get your answer. We're not some backwards people that talk like a leprechaun. Actually we're in top 5 most developed in the E.U.
0:37: I was about to say "Like you, Jack!? XD"
Scottish accents suck... I should fucking well know coz even in Blackpool KFC CANT EVEN UNDERSTAND WHAT ZINGERBOX MEAL MEANS!!!!! 🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬
Love the Dublin type of Irish accent, and I agree that Irish is definitely very sexy. 10/10
I'm sorry can we talk about 'shave a bollock'
As an Australian, I'm finding myself confused why the Australian accent is as high as top five.
love this!😆😄 i love hearing different accents. the irish accent always fascinates me!
reminds me of foreigners with Australian slang
5:35 that sounds like russian
2:21 Jack trying to sound sound like Christopher Walken trying to sound Irish sounds like Arnold Schwarzenegger.
Love a woman with an Irish accent 😍😂
This video had me cackling, I go in and out of watching sean and not watching him but this video grabbed me by the neck and was like “nope ur back into watching him”
Jack: the t sound is always like an sh sound  Me with a lisp: my time has come
Pretty sure Brad Pitt was trying to be a gypsy not a Irish. But that might be the same 😅
It would be interesting to see how much Jack’s accent has changed living in southern England. My guess is if it has changed it’s probably softened a bit at the edges in a way if it has changed at all.
Thank god for Sean's translation xD
OK every body watching is obviously Irish I think so to prove you Irish replie with an Irish word
have ye seen the video of the sham from Killarney though
I swear that second farmer looks like Tom hanks,  I saw it before but never commented
4:54 timestamp for later
Jack: "We are built diffrent"  Me, canadien and irish: "Im a god amougst mortals"
This video made me subscribe. Loved it
Ah here Jack ya didn't recognise Blindboy with the bag on his head? Christ almighty you're missin out boy
Keep up the good vids
lol farty five that old man sounded like an asian who looks european but tries to speak a mix of irish and asian accent and a hint of ukrainian
I had a blast watching this
18:55 he sounds like hes from liverpool
Jack: “Irish accent is the SEXIEST accent”  also Jack: *Laughing at other irish peoples accents* 🤣
i love it when you full irish on stream its sooo funny
Kinda like English. Like in America we got Southern accents, New York accents and probably the most noticeable the Boston accent. So it’s kinda similar.
6:00 it sounds for me more like germany than english... ahhhhhhhhhhh
Jacks reaction to the vocal coach was by far the funniest thing I've ever seen and will ever see! 😂
The frostbite guy isn’t Irish he’s from Northern Ireland
"I just don't find the accent s e x y" WHUT THE FOK JEFF
When he said the Irish accent was voted sexiest I IMMEDIATELY credited that ONE irish ASMR preformer. If you know him you know him.
Oh god you wouldn't be long getting frostbit  I am from more northern Ireland
Dude, has anyone ever told you that you sound like Sheogorath from the TES games?
I was hoping to see you react to the Northern Irish. No1 understand kerry accent not even people from kerry.
Me: *hears the newsman and Jack say his name and thinks ‘oh this is easy, pssh-‘*  Also me: *severe brain farts, attempting to pronounce his name for about 2 minutes*
I lost my Mexican American accent when I was in 3rd grade, ever since then I can't do it, I sound white af now.
I tried to read all these comments but my accent kept coming out of the shadows   For instance, ‘Their mouths’ turned into “Thar Mawuths”
Jack sounds like Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz...
You do a better Walken than he does Irish
Jeff: I'm not drawn to them. Sean: WHAT THE FUCK JEFF!? His accent like on full blowXDXD
Im Scouse and I always say Irish folk are practically Family to us Scousers
I'm part Irish, so I understand a little more of what their saying than most people, but not all of it, like the old man, I had no clue what he was saying
FUN FACT THIS IS SET IN THE 2000S
When Jack reviews your cousin xD  07:00
KERRY PEOPLE WHERE YOU AAAAAT?!?!?
I'm from ni and this was made on my bday😬
XD
Feel bad that he missed Jamie Dornan in the first clip, the most northern irish sexy man in the world
im Irish but still can hardly understand what the fuck there saying
I’m able to understand almost all of them, does this make me more Irish than even jackspedicey???
he should've watched an episode of young offenders lol
*kicks door down* fuck yes Australia fuck yes fifth, I like how Sean also doesn’t say anything bad about Australia
Sheep and bright was all I heard.
'the Irish are build diverent' aaaand then you have the dutch and their accents.... like minen from Groningen

You should do one where you are trying to do other countries accents
Oh Ireland🇮🇪❤️ táimid ag fucking grá agat

Son: "Why did the irish old man sounded like he was speaking mandarin" Father: "It's a tradition"
6:45 YouTube subtitles: *HAVE A GOOD DRAGON*
Brad pitt is the most famous person from my home town. I think lol
5:13 That was what it felt like moving from Fermanagh farmers to Donegal farmers. I got a question asked to me and the whole sentence was crammed into one word they talked so fast. I got used to it quick but I'm an Ulster Scots dialect, Donegal was a shock to the system. Fermanagh were a bit more soft spoken

jacks accent is like American and irish mixed together i think it's the best accent i have ever heard.
I can do a banging irish accent
So I’ve been subscribed for a long time but sometimes Sean sounds like he needs to cough cause of the rasp in is throat
How can the auto subtitles understand the farmer’s accent and not normal simple accent 😂
jack i am from ireland!!!!
Im happy I'm irish I just wish my accent was a little more noticeable
I think the way we hear him speak is how non English speakers hear us talk 🤔
Australian accents are better but Irish accents are a close second
Tell ya one thing, Irish people speaking Gaeilge (Irish - Ireland’s national language)  It’s so fun bc Irish people speak quite quick so people like myself who speak gaeilge speak so much quicker

My favourite is jacks but my second favourite is mine which is northern Irish in county armagh WHICH IS NEVER MENTIONED BECAUSE JACK ENDED THE VID AS IT WENT INTO IT😡😫😢
I’ve actually watched the video with the accent coach
i was drinking milk when he was telling people to drink milk..
My accent is the best in the world   .  Cool i didnt know that
The mad accent one sounds like a sim talking
I love how the Irish rower guy on the left kept switching between smiling and looking serious, like he couldn't tell wheter to look friendly or professional.
f²
5:24 I honestly can’t tell if he is saying 35 or 45
I really love the Irish accent 😁  and to add on I can't say mirror either cuz I'm Afrikaans 😂
Don't worry Jack, I'm subscribed 😊 And your accent is awesome.
every time i hear somebody/youtuber say like and subscribe at the beginging of a video or half way, makes me want to dislike and unsubscribe but even when i am already not subscribed
I guess im use to hearing it, I have family that lives in Mayo. But those rural Kerry folk always make me listen harder. Also those Donegal ppl sometimes throw me off.
Drogheda is shit now im sorry  and dunleer
I feel like the last one is a bit of Scandinavian mixed with English which is the reason why no one understands him.
My Nan came from n. Ireland and my granddad came from s. Ireland, so I grew up being sworn at by both the hard and soft versions of the accent 😂
Jack: mirrrrrrrrrrrrrrr Me: wtf
Jack , did you ever get in many fights as a kid
"We Irish people are really a different breed"    Yeah, a breed that missed 2 evolutionairy steps
I used to work with an Irish backpacker.. he was a nice talkative guy but I had no clue what he said. Fuck they were long shifts.
I’ve lived in America all my life and have been brought up around American culture, but I’ve recently learned that my great grandmother was purebred Irish and my great grandfather was in the Irish Mafia, therefore I am an Irishman haha potatoes and whiskey top of the morning where’s my paddy cap
I've never hear my name being said so many times in a row... 🤣😵  I had no clue there was a place in Irland called Kerry.
The only time I truly go into my Irish accent is when I'm either getting agitated or when I'm a bit buzzed, however my accent is a bit high since my Irish ancestors came from southern Ireland, but I forgot the area that he said have a higher accent tone
Madeleine: "Flower. Sour. Hour." Sean: "Are you gonna say 'fleiyer?' And 'seir?'" Madeleine: "fLaYrE"
it is literally a new language
Uuhhh.... The best irish accent in the world is ya boi jack...😏

Yer one saying "in ENGLISH we say I" as if we're speaking a different language😂
I feel like people who fail miserably in doing a irish accent and my dude seán can’t even understand it, you know you fucked it up.
Why do the Irish put 239 beans in their Irish bean stew? Because if they put one more bean it would be two farty.
making fun of locals
Leave a comment about the accent I liked the most? The Irish one. Doesn't matter which 😂😂🤣
I understood about half of what the farmer said and that's only because the Newfoundland accent can be a right mess too 😂😂 Sorry my loves, but it's true 💕
Ah Brad Pitt you're lucky you're gorgeous..lol. weak 🤣🤣🤣🤣

Shout out to all the VOWELBENDERS
6:40 im from limerick and ive no fuckin clue what hes on about

We want a part 2 we beg of u Sean
6:43 this guy sounds a LOT like Daithi
If you want to hear Irish incarnate Sean Mcguire from rdr2
I thought Brad Pitt's... "tribe" in Snatch were actually Scottish caravaners.
The southern Irish accent is another dialect lol
I lived in In Ireland for 16 years of my life and than moved to the u.s my ascent has not gone away and my gf lived in Russia for 6 years and still has a little acsent

The high school boy one has the same accent as me
Irish sounds like a drunk polish person tried talking in English
I instantly thought of the guy from Brave that no one can understand
why the hell 18:33 look like Justin Trudeau
If you think these accents are hard to understand, you should try to understand someone with a Newfoundlander accent.
*That Irish farmer is my spirit animal.  I don't understand what he says with my ears.  But I understand with my soul.*
Yea we do run around in cattle fields tho lol
But Christopher Walken's mother was Irish?... You know what, nevermind.
I’m Irish
I couldn’t understand anything from the farmer, it literally sounded like he was speaking Vietnamese or some shit
1:40 that slap man
Spanish accents are the sexiest! (and the most masculine)
11:32 Man sounds just like Father Jack Hackett
Your accent is like half US.
Jacksepticeye is Irish. Has red, white and blue back ground. 🤦‍♂️😂
I would see that Christopher Walken Irish movie in theatres just to hear his accent
Ireland and Scotland on top
My first ever trip out into the world from my home of Finland was to go and meet people I had chatted to online for years in Ireland. I loved it! Bought a flatcap in Killarney in County Kerry on our way back from Moher, and I couldn't understand a word the old lady cashier said, so my Irish friend had to help! Good memories!
Me: *tries Irish accent* Me: *Australian accent too strong* Also me: * knows damn well il I'm Irish*
I’m from America and I’m very proud of myself because I understood a good bit of that.... wow
I hate our accents up North, sounds like a meat grinder ffs... 😂
Not Cilian Murphy? That's as blasphemous as an Irish not drinking Whisky!!!
"Park. Garden. I say those words like that already. I'm pretty good at this." Irish guy following a tutorial on how to do an Irish accent... 👀
Farmer Michael says you sound Jamaican. I've gotta agree.
irish to Irish encryption
this was so amazing! i can't breathe
I clicked subscribed when you yelled "get fucked Italy", I love Italy, but holy shit that made me laugh
Look I love jack but you have to notice he always avoids the topic of the north of Ireland, which I don’t get. Because at the end of the last video there’s a northern Irish accent and he totally skips it and he’s avoided the topic before. I love jack and idc I’m just wondering
You my friend are a legend
It sounds like french
Brad Pitt was doing a gyspey accent not an Irish one
“Eat shit France “ they already do      Snails
As it went on I got better at understanding it
I'm a translator who specializes in English and there *SO. F*CKING* little Irish and Scottish material to work with when you're learning different accents, _this_ is one of the most helpful videos i've found. Take that as you will.
I have a teacher from kerry and her irish accent omg when she’s pronouncing the ch it sounds like she’s choking xD  I still can’t put a sentence together in irish even after learning it for years lol
I once had an Irish friend ... almost couldn't understand some words but I learned that they sure are partiers
I'm from cork and I feel like a "stereotypical" irish accent is a very melodic harsh version of a cork accent🥴
I'm sorry did she really "in English" pretty sure you're American lady
Scotland is better
Me smiling and laughing while trying to understand the guy with a heavy irish accent*  "You need a good jog?"  Jack: All you need is a good dog" "OMG DOG NOT JOG- AHAHHAHAHHAHAHAH"   I'm going to be doing a irish accent next time i speak (I do that subconsciously, ill hear a accent for a while and the next time i speak i try to do it in that accent without even thinking. Im weird i know )( ˊᵕˋ )
I'm English     Read more
Brad Pitt's Irish accent is exactly how i pictured! 😂😂😂 Every accent he does feels like a blatant parodical knockoff!  In a hilarious good way i might add!
I live in skibbereen!!
Speaking of the French, their tanks had 7 gears for reverse and 1 forward gear.
"IM A VOYEL BENDER" BROKE ME hahahahH
when i was younger and when my ma and da said “aye your women” or “aye your man” i used to think that we owned women and men i was dumb sorry

0:15 I agree.
From an Irish man to an Irish man it’s bloody jibrish
"That Even I Cant Understand" Proceeds To Literally Translate Them For Us XD Classic Jack
The Irish Accent is the 100 Gecs of accents
UP THE COUNTY
Im from Ireland but i dont have that strong of an accent but i got so triggered at brads HORRIBLE accent that i screamed so loud that my mam busted into my room with a wooden spoon in her hand so yea I think you know what happened next😢
Bad Irish ACCENTS even caption can't spell it out
It sounded like he genuinely meant that to France
To all my northern irish people didnt anyone notice that he stopped the video when it came to the north were still irish u no!!!!!
I can understand the irish schoolboy but the farmer had me scratching my head an my mom has a thick irish accent at that.
Is it me or did he say farty five sheep
The Irish accent sounds like British and Scottish accents had a baby and then that baby decided it didn’t wanna sound like it’s parents so it made its accent more subtle Sorry if this was offensive, that’s just what it sound like to me 😅
I can understand a decent portion of the thick accents. Maybe because I’m part Irish. Who knows. But I grew up and still live in America.
Reminds me of finnish WRC rally english. It's horrible to listen :D
Ok. I'm Irish BTW so I know this. There are many different Irish accents depending on where you live. I'm from Waterford and I can tell you that even different parts of counties have different accents. For example there is a town on the border of Waterford and Cork and I swear to god their accents over there are insane. They don't know if they are from Waterford or Cork and they don't know who to support in hurling either. It's so funny and I can go on forever about accents but imma stop
that movie did have one irish actor jamie dornan
Irish people too funny
"Eat Shit France!" As a French person, yes. I approve
YES Sweden is number 7! My favorite number! Screw you number 1. 7 is better! 007. 777. 7 is the best!

The subtitles are actually good, just what I needed lol
I sound          Human
The kerry accent boy
I am 100% irish, I lived in Wicklow and then moved to Dublin. I do not thicken my accent to show dominance during an arguement. I don’t know where you got this fact, whether you made it up or you got it from the internet, but as far as I know, it’s not true.
Best accent in the UK/euro maybe NZ male accent is always top of the board globally
My accent is sorta fecky cuz it's a blend of Irish and Australian.
LOL, i couldn't understand a word that man said and my in-laws are from Ireland as well as the whole family.  No, you sound great.  You have a beautiful Irish accent.  Some sound like they are singing.  I love it
Very happy that jack is able to translate the farmer lmao
Irish sounds funny

This lady be saying jacksoiptoicoi in an Irish accent
Excuse me I'm Irish and I can't even understand them
If I was the reporter after he responded to my questions I’d be like: 👁 👄 👁
I'm from County Cork😁 (not very far from Skibbereen where the rowing lads are from), next door to Kerry. I can understand most of them to be honest. The first time the farming lad spoke hadnt a fuckin clue but honestly after second time I got him   And my God that girl was NOT from Kerry not a chance...
Your Christopher Walken impression was amazing 😂😂😂😂
IM irish and im pretty lose but its pretty easy to understand tho why is emily blunt like what is she doing speaking irish
frostbutt 8:15

19:10 I'm still laughing til this day
If irish are speaking english why is there accent so terrible? They need to fix that its anoyying one cant understand them same as europeans. They vomit their words out rather than pronounce them.
The hot fuzz joke made me happy
Jamie DaArnan is the only OYrish person in wOIld mountin Toyme!
Is "squirrel" really "skiddle" in an Irish accent?
Petition for Jack to do a southern accent I want to hear that
I was playing gta with some old friends of mine and they are Irish, but as the night went on there accents got heavier and heavier... found out later after I got off they passed out they were that drunk.  Explains the heavier accent
I always wanted to see Jack roast Sean Connery's Irish accent in Darby O'Gill & the Little People.
I’m so glad I don’t have a thick Irish accent (like i sound Irish and non Irish ppl can tell but like compared to ppl from cork or Kerry I’m but a CHILD)
Who here is from Kildare 🔥🔥
Is it strange that I understood the farmer perfectly well?
How did i miss this amazing vid
So I'm guessing the rubberbandits are from limerick, right?
11:32  “Feck” “Arse” “Girls” “Drink”
Wait why wasn’t British in the top 5 sexiest accents
That's how different languages form

Toppa the mornin' to ya lads
2:54 I watched the film Snatch yesterday and I thought of this video because I remember Jack showing this in the video 😂😂
This was fun.
New Zealand is the sexiest accent.
The Kerry one sounds like a brummy
Brad Pitt’s character speaks ‘so you can’t understand em’ in snatch  He’s not ACTUALLY Irish he’s just tryna confuse them 😂
I can watch this as a series, of Jack reviewing Irish accents
But that Christopher Walken was on point doe....
My name is ireland im a American its hard for me to have the acsent
FROSTBUTT
2:23  he sounds more like arnold schwarzenegger than irish
5:32 just smile and nod
You know now its New Zealand that has the most sexy accent in the world lol
I'm Irish
Funny enough, I can understand them. I can even understand the thickest Scottish accent. I don't know if it has to do with me being half Scottish and part Irish, I don't think it does to be honest. I think I'm just used to hearing them 🤣
Only reason I’m here is because of YouTube recommendations   I’m so glad it did🤣
There is an old youtuber I used to watch named ChooChoo gaming. And his accent was mad.  He was the one always saying. What's the crack lads? Definelty irish through and through
He’s so proud that the Irish accent is voted “the mOsT SeXIesT” accent 😂
Gerard butler is scottish
The Kerry one was English?
The louth one didnt sound like Louth to me at all?
Celtic accents are butchered more than any other I reckon. Even my own name but I don't really mind that.
That Kerry accent!!!!!!! That’s not a Kerry accent
Brad Pitt sounds like Russell Crowe in Winter’s Tale. That one was also pretty bad
Jack.....our indian accent is way more cringy... "HALLO, HOU ARRE  YOUU"
the rower boys are pretty :']
"he didn't sound like he was OFf WItH tHE fAIrIES" hahahaha that hits home haha that's every person I know that thinks they do a good Irish accent haha
I'm Irish and their SO bad Irish accidents
I thought british accent was hot and then I heard scottish accent and it changed my opinion... And now Irish... Guess I just love not understanding what people are saying.
Also, my piano teacher in community college is a very beautiful Irish woman. It sounds like she's from Cork, but either way, her accent is amazing!! This is coming from a guy that's your typical Texan music geek
Yoooo, Jason Statham looks so young lmao
Those farmers where good singers so they were 🤌🏻
Anyone seen the Commitments? Now that's a film of Irish authetisity

I am Italian and I’m not offended by this
All u need is a good dog and a tralor true farmer true. 🤣. I really don't sound Irish
I can do Swedish accent

0:24 Scottish should be place one no, wait. saxon. lmao
-Do you have a licence for that firearm?  -idoesforthisone -He says he does for this one. -What do you mean this one?
I'm Irish and I hate these clips
🇮🇪
This reminds me of Portuguese. So, we have both Madeira and Azores (Açores) islands, and we, continental Portuguese, need subtitles to understand our fellow Azorean Portuguese. Yes, you read right. SUBTITLES. That's how hard it is for us to understand them, but we love them all the same. I never visited the islands though but I do recommend, since it's one of the most beautiful places on Earth! 🇵🇹
Jack, I understand some of your pain, as an American, everyone thinks that all Americans have southern accents😂😂😂
Kevin couldn’t understand the Irish farmer
Ey celebrating my birthday on March 2nd by getting absolutely shit face I’m a McJunkin btw correct way to say it is McDunkin but America fucked up our last name when my ancestors moved here it’s actually both Irish and Scottish funny part is I’m also German and Scandinavian look more Irish yet have no bloody accent which sucks
I haven’t laughed this much in a long time
I’m English and I can confirm That woman is definitely British
lol I remember this one time this Irish couple came up to my slide (I'm a lifeguard I was in charge of Tornado) and their accents were  heavy and kept asking me questions, and they were mad drunk so it was even harder to understand but I understood some questions and they were like "oh your probably the only one that can understand me, now when we get off where the jacks here?" later found out too the catching lifeguard was told "Well that was a whale of a time" lol great people still don't know what they meant 😭
best Irish quote ever         Who the fook is that guy
How the FUCK isnt scottish above Itation
You do kinda sound like that but don't be sorry lol

"An 'edge is an 'edge, I dunno wha Reapers moaning abou" made me absolutely LOSE MY SHIT! 🤣
I understanded every word he said because I am irish
Lol your accent is so Americanized and I've been watching you for so long I am so used to your accent. These videos... I have no clue lmao
The most irish i could get to was irish capucinno
jacks accent is always tinted irish but he often sounds american but then he does things like this and he starts to sound like he's got a rubber tongue
Watching this video and seeing how Sean had now problem translating this made me wonder if I could do the same with my regional accent so I looked up a video of thick Appalachian accents and yes, I could understand every word. It’s funny how even if you’re accent isn’t as thick, how if you grow up in a place that you pick up on the language just so you can understand it.
I Dinae mind being 3rd
Me Being Irish Thinks This Is The Funniest yoke ever XD
Irish accents are vvvvvvv sexy, 100%- apart from maybe that one that sounded very Liverpudlian
3:10 - Technically, Brad Pitt is playing Romano-gypsy not Irish ...
Im irish aswell so i feel ye
You can never properly get a perfect Irish accent because different counties have completely different accents
As a person who speaks a heavy accent Yup even people in ur own country dont understand
In bruge is the best movie colin farrel
Petition for Jack to do his own "how to do an Irish accent" video
Hahaha you are killing me!!! I do this same shit with people trying to imitate Appalachian accents.
That sheep farmer guy, holy shit, I’m Irish but me and my friends and family have quite neutral accents so I always find it hard to understand any other accent that isn’t Dublin😂
As an Irish person these kind of videos are so fun
I'm irish
The best accent in this video was most defiantly Jack’s
fam cork has an unrivalled amount of accents, you can't just do 1
The louth accent is far off
Seán we for give you nah I’m joking come back we miss yah
I’d like to hear jack react to the Newfoundland accent
Come back to us sean
If your not Irish like me, believe me he sounds kinda Irish so Jack, you have a Talent.
I have a friend named Scot and every time he meets someone he says "Hi I'm Scot from Scotland." and He tells a story about when he goes to a restaurant with his parents he has to explain his parents order to the waiter.
I move to ireland 5 years ago, some irish were really hard to understand, and my English was also not good, I found myself confuse if was my fault or not.
The thick Irish accent makes it sound like a German speaking English . Btw i used to take German classes years ago even tho I don't remember anything but yeah :")
I was so off what the irish sheep farmer was saying lmao
"farty-five"
I am from Irish descent, and I can understand each and every one of them. Even though I was born and raised in America. I am only a little bit Irish, but me family members have a lot of red heads. I do study Ireland and Irish things a lot ,so. Not hard for me to understand them :)
Do you like dags ???
I never realised how much of an accent i had til i heard some of these. Just sounded so normal. It was like an out of body experience
Scottish...? I lived in Scotland for 5 yrs..n no...is this because of shrek yet?? Yea.. its shrek's fault.
10:45 I believe she is referring to a strong Northern Irish accent...where basically any Vowell sounds like 'oy' in some form. Actually nope she just mixed bastardised versions (that's not a criticism...imitating an accent will never result in the real thing) of about 10 different accents.
The best was when my class' Irish maths teacher had to say '43'...sigh.
And I thought Scottish was hard to understand
It is 100% the best accent...that maybe bias from a guy with a very large percentage of Irish blood but...still.
could kinda understand the farmer, im scottish so could kinda make it out
He does a better Walken than Walken does Irish lol
STOP STOPPING PLS GODDAMN
Me uncle below in Kerry does
I felt called out when he said "go to bed bitch"
Goes to Ireland Irish man: "ajdhjshkjdfdjhjs" Me: "where is Sean??? WHERE IS SEAN?!! HELP ME!! TRANSLATE ITTTTT!!
I’m Irish and good lord 😂 I fear for any tourist who asks for directions.
reguarding the locals thick accent i got maybe 5% of the first farmer lol maybe 30% of the second one then with the rest i was pretty good bout 50% or more
That last bit was so accurate
I'm from galway and I got an okay grasp of what the kerry lad was sayin
Loved this video! Our favourite Oirish accent was yours!
Omg the reason you can't understand them is because they barely open their mouths
I too, as a northern Indiana resident, say mirror with 15 r's. I thought that was normal. Turns out I'm Irish! Top o' the morning to ya, laddies!!!
At least I was the 6th sexistiest accent 😞
pov : your  from Meath and your grandparents are from Donegal  . and u didn't think it could get any funnier
That was the fella that made that song about the horse outside 😂😂
We get our accent from our native language. Seán is from Athlone is West Meath. If you want to here the strongest accents go to County Kerry County Mayo County Cork County Clare County Tyrone County Cavan County Derry County Donegal  Ye won't understand these now. I am from South Co Mayo myself so I've quite a thick accent apparently 😂😂
Wait- I thought ur name was jack, I- I’m lmao I’m dying
This video is hilarious.
Its funny seeing someone try and teach a South African accent. Haha, there is no such thing as a South African accent....we have 11.
İm irish
His impersonation of Christopher Walken at 2:20. It was great!
1:07 This Reminds me of Skylanders
A woman with an Irish accent, especially Dublin and county cork, sexiest accent ever to exist.
I’m from carlow I was at a game carlow vs Louth carlow won so I shouted I can’t hear you anymore Louth.      Like so jack will see
wait does seán not know about THE RUBBERBANDITS?? highly disappointed..
Im born and raised American but ive got half irish genes so i think that for some reason i can understand this shit lol, I literally understood what that heavy accent guy was saying evern though ive never attempted to interpret irish before lmao
Jack septic eye the Irish speaking translator for other forms of Irish at your service.
2:21 he sounds like gru tho-
mir
that rower lad is doing medicine in collage, hwhat a lad
we are amazing lad great vid :)
deewoooon in cweounteh kerlry, weeve de fine luvly acsent, fine kyerly wimen
era be grand let em off lad :D
Everyone knows Donegal is the best Irish accent. End of story.
Brad Pitt sounds more like he's from Prince Edwards Island in Canada, rather than Irish.
Shit Texas is just one state in the US and we've got at least four different accents here.
That rower was sk Irish he sounded Jamaican
I do feel like they could do that skit with the voice activated lift and the Scottish accent with Irish instead and it'd be just as funny. Actually just throw in one of each and we'd die laughing
Why was Scottish fourth? 😂😂
Is it weird that I don't think the Shephard guy was that hard to understand? Brad Pitt was harder lol
6:00 can I turn on captions and get a translation?
You should listen to the Scottish one.
What awful voice the guy with the earphones has. It's like hearing a chicken being strangle.
“Cork has the strongest accent” meanwhile Kevin
4:44 its says kinda sus XXXXXXDDDDDDDD
Ok when you said scotland is bad ummm I was like "thats your gaelic neighbor" xD
Scotland will beat your country in any sport even in wars
I lived in Ireland for two years and miss not understanding everyone around me!
Brad Pitt nailed the accent. That's what the gypsies sounded like.
Some of that farmer talk sounded like simlish
This video makes me wonder if my ancestor that came to the US 1850 was understood when he came here & if I’d be able to understand him
Omg the first movie has gotten SO much shit from the Irish. & I love how sassy they get about it
I don’t think it’s sexy, but I do think it’s adorable
Ngl l haven’t heard the word langar in a while
Russia should be nominated for most satisfying, scariest, coolest accent
I know you said you were from County Offaly in previous videos but I just wanted to ask, what would you say your Irish accent is closest to, geographically? Do you just have what would be considered the "standard" Irish accent? And no, you sound perfectly intelligible and fine.
im irish and i dont have a good one and i literally just cannot do one
2:22 sean lowkey sounded like gru lmao
2:21         New theory, Seán is now Gru
Brad Pitt is so Brad Shit at acting
Anybody else who's Irish cry while watching this 😂😂😂
Its all fun and games until this man spoke the  *enchanting table language*
Me: 6:06 am and I haven't slept Jack: GO BACK TO BED, CHILD, START DRINKIN MORE MILK, BITCH Me: * sets down glass of milk * but I'm busy watching ur videos 👉👈
"let's see how many of you can understand what the farmer said"  dude, i can't even understand what the newscaster said sometimes
8:12  I just wanna say Im feeling this dude roghtnhere cause when The Mother says you gotta go to school you dont got much choice in the matter. I didnt miss ANY school growing up unless the Doctor said I was too sick or the school was closed and EVEN then I had scool work cause my Mom would go TO the School and GET my work while my Grandparents watched me. There was NO Option when it came to school work except to DO IT. X'D
I couldn't even believe that the guy who lost 45 sheep was speaking english because I understood NOTHING except for when he said "45"
It’s very hard to not accidentally start doing a Scottish accent when I try to do a Irish accent.
Whenever someone says thyme I have a flashback to grade school where we were having an argument on how to pronounce thyme and then the plant man said it is pronounced thim-e
Dudeee i do a Irish accent when im mad, im actually Irish from my dad and Italian from my mum
Imagen 45 sheep being stolen
Jack trying to be Christopher Walker trying time be Irish sounds like me trying to be Steve Carrell as Gru
She is speaking the Belfast accent
Sean Mac an tsithigh or should I say Sean Mac and sit high
dying in cringe
jack's accent is the best
the sheep farmer part took a moment hearing it but i got it ... but seeing Scottish accent high upon the list ... i not mad at that and the respect shown got instant thumbs up lol
Bruh-
I feel like the irish and Australian accents are the ones that get heavily over exaggerated
5:32 (i actually understand a bit so I'll translate) "I'd be afraid there'd be a full moon and with the brightness I'd be afraid anyone could pull up to the mountains in the light, sure"
This is what I imagine english sounds like to non English speakers
Thats cause his is fake lmaoooo
It's CARK, baiii!!
the second guy in the mad accent video was actually pretty easy to understand from my perspective
Jesus Christ it’s like another language
Im irish I dont have the accent but can do it
Jack: try saying mirror with an Irish accent  Jack: *says half my name*
The frostbit guy is from northern ireland
He lives near me and all you people making fun of him he’s living in and Irish speaking part of Ireland English is not his first Language...
It's clearly made for an American audience. I doubt they're too worried about it tiny population. It'll probably end up on Netflix and get watched anyway. And OMG I know you'll never read this but I agree 100% with your assessment of Brad Pitt.
oh mah god! its so true lol
Brad Pitt sounded australian/Scottish.
Ok
Stop me if I'm wrong but if Christopher Walken was doing a Terry Wogan impersonation its fucking bang on
I'm gonna live in Ireland pretty soon, and English it's not my first language... So now I'm worried... hahahahhahaha
The lady: music of the Irish accent Sean: Am I a joke to you?
I come from England and I’m currently trying to do a northern accent and it’s really difficult 😂
When the farmer came on I felt like I was having a stroke
That news reporter is EXACTLY sounded like Jack in Survival Hunter Minecraft episode ;D
yes we slap horses asses and run through the cattle with our arms out
What’s the craic lad ?
Someone needs to try get an american actor to do a cork accent they would be so confused
Us: will you make another Awful Asmr video?  Jack: save your breath for cooling your porridge
It may be the scottish in me but i could understand him for the most part
me drinking milk from serial bowl when I said I was gonna sleep early   jack: WHY don't ya go back to bed CHILD WHY don't u DRINK MILK   lol it just hit my funny bone ya know
5:40 that sounds like he’s speaking backwards
Cork is easy to understand
Hey, uh, how's it going, I know this video is from a while ago but I just want to say...     *heswearingadifferentshirtinthethumbnail.*
19:53 Jack that's the rubberbandits!!
Wait the guy from hot fuzz was actually saying stuff...??
I figured out the farmer if you told me his subject matter and just paused and repeat his words.
Girl:o  Jack:I  Me:hoy is what we say in here
cork is my favorite, its the most stereotypical one Americans think of.
Jack's Christopher Walken impression sounded like Gru from Despicable me
It sounds like if German and English had a child that is that Irish farmers accent
every number that starts with “farty” is already a mad load
The automatic subtitles understand them so much better than me it's confusing
Try being polish
The farmer lived down the road from me
"It's just Mi and 15 r's" is fucking killing me rn
Are you sure the farmer was speaking english? Sounded like a completely different language 😂
im double subbed but im on my moms work account so i would sub again but she would murder me a million times over
VOWEL BANDERS
now you lesten 'ere boehb, i was takin a gander down at de new shahppe down de road, and saw de peculiar lettle feller sweggin down sahme cahld ahrange juice wit de bahys
Being Scottish I'm used to some pretty crazy accents but the farmer is basically just going uhhh ahj uaa
its the same with Scottish accent
why does it sound like German
@18:43 the character in the video sounds like bear grills 😂
you should move to cork for a year and see how you sound
Never even heard of this guy.
You can spot all the Americans so easily here
I’m usually good with accents but that farmer was a nope
12:58 had me breathless from laughing so hard 🤣🤣
I understood one word the farmer said and that was sheep
lmao. I'm fucked. Writing a story with an Irish character and some of my readers want me to do a read aloud sometime.
Please check out regional accent discrimination by foil arms and hog. It would be an awesome follow up!
its not the accent thats my favorite, but just the way that irish people speak
Nah, your accent is very clear. Quite easy to understand.. but when you played these videos.. some of these accents are so thick.. holy sheep..
Now I feel bad for loving Brad Pitt’s accent in that one movie. As a non Irish person, I thought how not understandable it was for so well with how naturally not understandable the accent itself is
My grandad had such a strong Irish accent I couldn't understand him.
Hes seen hot fuzz
That was a dunns bag and he did a PERFECT blindboy impression!
Jaesus those are some mad accents
MORE IRISH ACCENT REVIEW I LOVE IT (if you want)
OMG! I just realised why some ppl on the internet thinks im irish when i speak. My swedish dialect makes it so when i speak in english it sound a little bit like the O'Donovan Brothers 😂
Me: loves Jamie Dornan and Emily blunt also me: haha ha🤣🤣🤣
The equivalent of this, for German people is Hessisch.
My father was from County Kerry, Castlegregory to be precise.  Came to America when the lottery opened up in the 60's, that man held his brogue til the day he passed.  Not too many Yanks could understand him, even though the man spoke English lol.  But that is something I will always cherish, his voice.  It kills me to know I will never hear it again, but I was blessed to hear it.  I do understand the man in the video with the stolen sheep and I was born here in the states.
I know brad Pitt is planning to have a movie in Ireland soon (even tho corona is messing with that)...they’ve changed the script a few times now but like hEy he’s doing another movie in ireland
Yours is strong, but pretty much understandable lol
What Ireland is to England is what Friesland is to the rest of the Netherlands...
watch a newfounland strong accent trust me im newfi and uh...just trust me
I remember going to Dublin for a Football match and a Dub was f'ing and blinding and i died laughing because of her accent. Me being from Monaghan but a Tyrone supporter i was called a Black bastard.( black and tan in other words. Not being racist. Its just what irish people say to people from the North) and my Cousin told he to shut up and go fuck herself.
Alternate title, Irish man laughs at irish accents for 21 minutes. (Loved it though😂❤)
Thank you. 😊
I'm English surely I can understand that Irish farmer. Jack plays the video. Me: ... Nope
It's like trying to say different types of Dutch accents hahaha
Im convinced that the Irish farmer was speaking in sims language
i’m from newcastle and can understand any accent except my own
👁👄👁 me trying to understand some of the clips
have you tried to understand north welsh farmer sheaezuz
6:44 it's not all a typical job
Anyone else notice Jason Statham in the Snitch movie?
I think the guy from Limerick in the last video, with the spar bag and the knife, is suppose to represent The Rubberbandits

I love that jack trying to be Christopher  Walkin with a fake Irish accent kinda sounds like Arnold schwarzenegger
i never thought irish accent could be this heavy cuz I thought sean's accent was already heavy
Why does thick Irish accent sound so much like thick Minnesota accent sometimes?
I usually understand what Irish are saying. But these are the funniest I ever encountered!🤣
I got 50/ Irish but I geuss that wasn't  enough for a good Irish accent:/
Ahhhh!!!!!!! Limerick is not a bad place to live. Please stop calling us stab city. We only got that name cause 2 families went nuts and started killing each other and that was like about 15 years ago
OK so I'm an northerner in Scarborough and I don't understand the Irish accent heavy but I understand half of what the mad accent farmer who lost his sheep
I’m Irish I had a hard time figuring tha out for the old fella
I recognized the Cork accent as Kevin's accent (CallMeKevin)
Fart-i-five? Wtf? is that forty five?
brad pit sounds like his lines were so bad they had to auto generate them
lads before i start this video i bet i will understand them.
I live in cork lol
Please react to Foil Hog and Arms video Every Irish movie. It's like this movie looked at that skit and just copied it.
When people realize that there are different dialects of accents, theyll understand why everyone sounds different from the same place.
To do an accent I just watch Irish Youtubers. I watch a few, one of which is from Belfast :)
(Spoilers to American gods) Who also came here as a coping mechanism over mad Sweeney’s death?
No jack, I can understand you jack
"I'm great at this" - yeah dude, you are Irish after all... no surprise you're great at doing an irish accent :P
That guy on that UTV News report has a v VERY! Thick Derry Accent.
me, french, watching this video: 👁️👄👁️
2:25 Irish trying to be Christopher walken
I am irish to
Irish accents are absolutely sexy. My friend and I got approached by someone with one who asked for directions and we were so embarrassed we almost didn't answer.
Do Irish people think southern Americans sound weird
That was a very satisfying bitch at 0:43
The first one just sounds so forced its funny
Thanks. Im irish. Thanks. Thanks alot. Lol
What town in Ireland did you come from?
Miss Harvey makes me feel very uncomfortable.  She has the same vibe as an as seen on TV commercial from the early 2000s . . . somethings just not right 🥴
Jack's accent strengthened with each second that passed in this video  I think-
Jack is it weird that I understand this
MY BOY BE GETTIN GREY HAIRS!
she says garden like garda
I think the only reason i can understand him is because im from kerry
Also said 'sure cant ca'n anyone go up up on the mountains nowa days like'
My cosin is a farmer theyre whole family sound pure irish (im irish) but for the old farmer ah sure how can ye not understand him i think his accent was fine like he says 'i hink a couple of ran went up to em um he mountains ya k hmm' like simple i dont understand how ye think its hard seán
6:38 Hot Fuzz is fricking hilarious, didnt know he liked it 🤣 he must know Shaun of the Dead because hes called Sean too but spelt different 🤣🤣
I liked the vid casue he said bitch in the first minute
I'm French and you me to understand those accents??
Is it only me or Jack looks like he's wearing shades on his eyes? it's looking hella good tho
I'm Irish and even- Like there- Un hear able
*turns on captions to see if it can tell what they’re saying* captions: *just disappear*
Mmm I do enjoy hearing the Irish accent. But I reckon the Aussie accent is the best.
Jack: Shows his subscriber percentage  Me: BITCH YOU HAVE 26,000,000 SUBS!!!!! 😂
Part 2 part 2!!!!
I don’t even 100% understand jack, now I’m watching this. XD
Jack is like the study material.  The farmer is like the test.
I have a really americanized irish accent lol
"What a legend." *continues to watch video Meanwhile I'm like "WAIT BUT WHAT DID HE SAYYYYY?" XD
Hey I’ve watched vocal lessons from Madeleine!
I was actually cracking up from this, good stuff lol
2:23 he kinda sounds like gru from despicable me lmao
I know there are a shit ton of dialects, but which o e is closest to the stereotypical lucky charms leprechaun?
Mickey isn't Irish in Snatch. God I love that movie.
14:10 thanks for the apology
Lol I watched that ladies tutorial to learn an Irish accent for a dnd character
Everyone shhhhh  The Sims language is taking over
It's not "herb" it's "HERB"!
I'm from Cork, and I am *amazed* that you could translate the farmer's first sentence I stgggg

lmao jack you got me dead
Sean; go back to bed child, start drinking more milk B I A T C H  Me; ...  . . . I drank a gallon earlier
" Voted most ...... in the world!!! "  Reality with most surveys: Only 5000 people took part in the survey xD
Else do u want to build a snowman              Irish man : well you wouldn't be long getting frost bite    Else: ok fine
I’m fully Irish and can’t understand a word from the farmer
Snatch is a good movie
Christopher Walken is allowed to speak that way because he is Christopher Walken and people pay to hear him talk normally. At least he goes after the low-hanging fruit when it comes to Irish accents! ;)
Fun fact when irish people are arguing they thicken their accent to show an act of dominance
I thought it was new zealands accent
I’m from south Dublin and no. Ur one at the end from south Dublin is the posh side of south Dublin. I full on sound like Conor mcgregor
0:25 Sean: “No luck for you Scotland!” Me, a Scottish-American: “Well at least he was nice-ish about it and didn’t tell us to eat shit like France.”
Sometimes Irish people sound like Germans speaking english
How did 1.4k  people dislike this video, probably was all the British people living in Kerry lmao.
So basically the thick Irish accent is like a thicker upper Midwest accent...
Fun Fact: Scottish people a more likely to be Red-Headed than Irish people.     Fuck your stereotypes
They sound like the Canadians... no offense
I’m irishhhhhh
yo that first dublin chick is unfair cause she's cute as fuck and her pickup lines are adorable.
Old joke wadya  call an Irish 7 course meal? A tatter and a 6 pack
I love how you'll say the number 30
Feck it why not Sean come back well take ye any day u majestic specimen of a fella 😂😂😂
Yer fella with the spar bag and the knife is the rubber bandits they make music but there just mad funny they take the mickey out of everything
Connacht didn’t even get a mention 😔✊
Been to Cork once... Wow.
so forty five > is pronounced as farty fayv . . then cork is cark . . which means change the 'o' to 'a' and pronounce 'th' to just 't' then you are a little Irish . . i am fascinated by the accent
what an enjoyable video
To be fair, Pitt's accent is supposed to be Traveller, not quite Irish
Faking an Irish accent got me my current girlfriend
cén fáth Dia duit ann daoine na hÉireann     *lets see if anyone gets that?*
When county cork comes up nd its ur town on the picture
11:06 that sounds like someone making fun of an Irish accent, I know because I love to do it.
That schoolboy cracked me up
How did Irish win sexiest accent? When they start speaking is just "asdakjgfikuauoshdiajsjkladlahsuodh"
and they said britons had bad teeth
You should react to Cornish accents
@6:29 sounds like he has a lisp going on.
i can understand some of it but the rest sounds like some mumbling no afenss jack also my spelling is not good
I feel like those Irish accents are so thick cuz they are drunk as skunks
the guy who had sheep, I thought he was speaking German
My folk kinda made a point of saying "top of the mornin' to ya!" so we could joyfully toss back "And the rest o' the day to you!"
"ya see limericks known as stab city"  oh buddy if you only knew
I work in customer support for US but there was a time that our team was providing support for UK. The hardest part of the transition was to get used to the accent, but that heavy Irish accent is something that I wasn't and I'll never be prepared for. (Taking into consideration that my first language is Spanish)
I'm convinced that Chileans are the Irish of the Spanish speaking world
The video was super fun, mission accomplished.
So to be clear, that "How to do an Irish accent" was for singers, right? The way she was describing the flow of the vowels definitely made it sound like she was telling them how to sing an Irish song
the way i was sobbing but couldnt help but laugh at this
this is great
Farty five
I can somewhat understand it the longer I hear the mad accent
9:00 idk why but I understood like perfectly
I am Irish I am in county Mayo
Aang is an air bender katara is a water bender Zuko is a fire bender  Toph is an Earth bender but Jack 11:15
Holy shit i understand 80% that 45 missing sheep..
Farty  five sheeep
If you want a good accent you’ll probably need to live in the accented areas
I'm so late to this video. Still just wanted to point out that in Snatch the accent Brat Pit does is extremely over the top to highlight the fact they earlier in the move they said that they don't understand a single word they say :p
irish accent sounds like a voice being played backwards
Im pretty sure the guy from the thumbnail is just speaking gaelic or something, thats everything but english
You have to react to Tom hardy’s Irish accent from Peaky Blinders😍
please do Australian accent next, do my country proud
Do u know niall horan
póg mo hón
That 'schoolboy' was deffinitly a grown man
"Is this what people see me like?"  Well... it's an acquired taste, that's for sure. It took me a good few weeks to get used to it. It's really nice, don't get me wrong, but I do still remember vividly being absolutely confused half the time when watching you the first few days.
Dude, there are some broad Australian accents that sound like that sheep farmer. The rowers are hilarious, though their accents weren't completely indecipherable like the sheep farmer xD
I come from an Irish Family and struggled to understand that farmer past a few words
C'mon guys be serious. Frushtbutt is not to be laughed with.
why does the news anchor sound like kevin if his voice was a bit lighter
i encourage everyone to turn cc’s on. i’ve laughed way too hard at this already hahahah
I’ve heard some thick Scottish accents in my time but I couldn’t understand A WORD that farmer was saying 😆
When youv been friends with some one for years but they second they start speaking with an Irish accent you check if your phone and car keys are still in your pocket lol
after this, im convinced that sean has a translator built into his headset
The entire time that guy was talking about dogs i thought he was talking about taking a jog outside to release stress.
Is it just me or is he making us all talk to ourselves?
Why did I laugh so much at Jack repeating "FARTY-FIVE??"
“Farty-five sheep have been stolen” Sean:“FARTY-FIVE?!”
I am actually quite fascinated by Irish accents and history and I have been working on trying to translate any accents and I can actually now understand mostly any accent. ( including the farmer guy)
I heard FaRtY five sheep xd
JackSepticEye you are a TREASURE. Thank you.
How did you not watch any of the Irish Traveller call out videos!?
The sheep farmer nearly killed me. My God, that was good. 🤣
I wish I had an Irishman. Lol
I showed my mom this and she is now a jackscepticeye fan :) she really liked the “get fucked Italy” part 😂
The wan going on about how to do an irish accent is making me insecure about the way I speak 😂😂😂
His Irish Christopher walkin song like Arnold Schwarzenegger
jacks face during the brad pit one has me wheezing he looks so disturbed
I love how it's a universal thing that the more time you spend with people who have the same accent as you, the stronger that accent gets.
half of my family is from Cork so that accent was easy to get but the farmers?? my god I was STRUGGLING😂😂  aight I wrote this half way through but oh my god the end bit about the Cork accent being higher than the rest had me rolling lmfaooo sounded like my aunts😂
im pretty aure im 25% irish
Jack is so cute 🥺
No, Jack, when you talk we hear "Hearts, moons, clooovers"
Bout time our accents got acknowledged
What I have learnt Just don't bother lerning Irish accent
6:00 minutes in he's just talking french
bro im northern irish and yeah still kinda a different accent but normally i can clearly understand down south people but it sounded like that farmer was Norwegian
Get F!cked Italy😂
my man invented the sims language
5:13 The news reporter sounds like RT
Me: *understands a brief part of what the farmer said*  MR WORLDWIDE
I would really love to learn how to do the Irish accent.
"Haha eat shit France"
*Northern Irish confusion noises*
if you want a good Irish accent I thoroughly  enjoy look up sgt ducky or this little channel called jacksepticeye but seriously sgt ducky has one of the best accents I have ever heard and I love it
I love how Jack's accent got progressively thicker and more pronounced as the video went on. XD
IF U CAN TRANSLATE THAT THEN U CAN TRANSLATE WHAT THE SHEEP ARE SAYING TOO
Teacher: "Oyerlind" Sean: "EYErland"
Being from West Kerry myself, Mickey-Joe O’Shea sounds like a lot of typical West Kerry farmers and i understood exactly what he said.
Is that headphone Sony WH-1000XM4 or M3.
*2:24* HEY IM WALKEN HERE!
I've worked at an Irish pub for the last 11 years that has only changed its playlist like twice since I have been there. I've developed the most county mixed accent XD I feel like to leans most heavily towards Cork though.
The schoolboy said "Well the mother said we had to so we hadn't much a choice
Sean: translates english so people who speak english can understand english.
6:00 im from Dublin in Ireland I don’t don’t have a clue wa hes on abou
I AM HAVING FUN! 😂
I've had this three times in person. Once from a Yuper, once with creole, and once with a random native american man.
yeh'lad!
Based solely on jacksepticeye, I would definitely agree that an Irish accent is the sexiest accent in the world.
12:42 I'm dead😂
ive noticed oneof the problrms is the lack of articulation, they dont open their mouths hence the difficulty to understanf
Sean i don’t think you sound that hard to understand
irish accent is the sexiest because women LOVE to not understand a shit, because we men just say NONSENSE, so you start using your hands instead and they imagine whatever suits them xD
I'm from Northern Ireland I can't even imagine trying to do the Irish accent.
Me waiting for Niall Horan
i just really want to know what you think about english people
Fun fact: the Newfoundlad accent is related to Irish.
Down the country in ireland they really do have strong irish accents its funny cause if go to a different county they bearly understand me cause am from donegal myself and that is because we talk while fast lol
The Kerry accent is basically a different language.
I swear, I've seen this title like seven times throughout the last week and every single time my mind fuses "bad" and "irish" into "british"
His accent did get stronger. After watching to the end, I jumped back to the beginning.😂
It's high up on my to-do list: to go to Dublin and drink a dark coloured drink that is "supposedly" the best in the world
Christopher Walken Irish?! I thought he was American
The guy with the spar bag on his head for Limerick is the guy from the Rubberbandits they have music on youtube if you look them up youll have a great laugh haha
Didn't understand one dam thing in the vid Lmfao including the YouTuber
"Start drinking more milk, bitch!" - Jacksepticeye 2020
tAHP OF THE MORNIN TO YE: My boyfriend makes this leprechaun sound whenever I mention you.
6:05 what the hell did he just say ?? 😂😂
Nawww aussie accent is only number 5
His Walken impression made me snot everywhere.
When that farmer said auiowre ghtiuyer uilguidf i;ulseiruygailuer iuer, that hit me hard
The Tipperary accent cause we are all farmers and hurlers
Ya know... watching him do this makes me realize... Jack is probably the only Irish person I’ve ever heard talk... so I don’t think I really have any sample size for what an actual Irish accent sounds like.... because either fake ones are incredibly exaggerated or Jack’s is incredibly subtle?   I never claimed to not be ignorant...
D'ya like dags?
Jesus
11:35 Jack: "Wow, I'm pretty good at this."  says the Irish person speaking in an Irish accent
It's a good thing you laugh so I know when to laugh.
“Irish farmer eats raw sausages” how was there no comments made about that?
Me being from the uk but being round Irish travellers my whole life  I understood everything!!
jacksepticeye was the best
Hell, they sound like my Uncles and Grand Da.
As a dialect coach...the movie clips hurt my soul.
I am from Limerick and he is so correct
CAN WE TALK ABOUT HOW THE GUY FROM FIFTY SHADES OF GREY IS IN THAT FUCKING MOVIE IM CRYING
"Like in Aiuil (oil)" First thing I thought of was the Southern American version where we just say it in a way I can't even write. Thick Irish accents remind me so much of thick Southern accents because I've met people down here I can't understand because they either leave out sounds or talk so fast and don't enunciate correctly. It's hilarious sometimes because you're just sitting there talking to an old Southern man in Walmart and he's talking so slow and with such a thick accent you have no clue what he's saying.  My mom used to say that her grandmother would say that her brother got "madogbit". Like it was all one word. (Her brother got "mad dog bit", or rabies).
Youre absolutely Not a good exmple for a hard Brit ACC.....dont Hype yourself.its gay af
My dads from dublin and my mam is from dundalk, My accent is just confused if I'm loud I go to Dublin if I'm quiet I go dundalk
0:57 Was Saoirse Ronan busy?
2:21 he sounds like gru  from despicable me 😂
“GET F*CKED ITALY”  Absolute perfection
They should of just cast brendan o carol in all the roles
He plays a Irish traveler, I s totally different and did a good job
"Every time people ask me to say 'Top Of The Mornin' I'm like 'Oh noooo" He says as he's wearing a Top of the Mornin tshirt 😂😂
Hey Jack i am from Northern Ireland antrim I know this is going to be a weird question but have you ever hear the Northern Irish accent and have you ever been to Northern Ireland?.
I am Irish but I was raised in America so I have an American accent but I could still understand everything I AM IRISH DEAP DOWN
the news narrator sounds like rt-
You're right on different accents in Ireland. Same in describing "American" accent. Easily  dozens
Fuck yea fucking Australia is 5th
the man with the missing sheep sounds like what i think english sounds like to non speakers
I came here because I heard a Brittish person who sounded the most Scottish I have ever heard in my life
Nope, am having a bloody hard time understanding that farmer. But to be fair, I'm German. You should have heard my great-grandfather speaking in his Dialect, especially from the nick of the woods where I come from where every town has it's own accents and there's my great-grandfather speaking his Dauernheimer Platt. A bit of a shame that the accent is dying really but overall, even if I can't understand a single word sometimes, I still absolutely love accents from any language.
This was hilarious.  My fav was the vocal coach she hadnt a clue
0:42 my new notification sound
thnk you for everything ive been here sence you played skate 3 and my grandad who passed away on the 16of december from covid took uk to one of youre shows in durham so whether you see this or not (Highly Unlikely You Will) I want you to know that im battling some shit rn and youve helped me so much so lets keep it going plz for me and for your amazing community whether anyone sees this or not i love you all 😘😘😘😘
Sean is my Irish dad.😊
irish sounds like every nordic language combined
Y didn't u do a Wexford accent
i think your accent is the greatest jack
Brad pits accent wasn't as terrible as I expected it to be but his lines made no sense 😂
Wild mountain thyme is going to become a cult movie, but only for Irish people.
Limerick looks like a member of The Rubberbandits.
In the guide to irish accents, is that the dood from the try channel? The one leather jacket guy had a thing with his mom?
We are indeed the sexiest in the world, come on lads 👏🏼
I'm dead. All i could think of was Gaelforce audios...I've been falling asleep to a cork accent xDDDDD
8:09 that dude has made a song. i think it was called girl for me
2:21 he sounds like gru from dispicable me.
when i have to do my listening in spanish
Irish people will go on about how much they love their ancestral homeland, its culture, and its accents, while in the same breath declaring a Somali who washed up on their shores this morning not only an Irishman, but every bit as Irish as someone whose family has lived there for centuries.
"eat shit france" and my dream place to travel has been ruined
I was readdyyy for you to react to a northern accent and you just paused the video, heart broken lmao
The accents from that first movie are so not Irish, even I, as an American, can tell how blatantly not Irish they are lmao. The farmer genuinely sounds like he's not speaking English at all like come on 😂😂😂
I can’t be the only one who relates an Irish accent with jack and  the leather jacket guy from the try channel 😅
Do people from Kerry even use words??! 😂😂
farty-five ship lol five vessels that smell like fart? or five sheep that farted a lot? 😂😂😂😂
Yah I’m a vowel bender! 😂😂😂
love how he understands keyspam-speak
I cannot fuckin understand the Irish man that lost sheep, not one word lmao
I love accents so much. I feel like American accents are so bland unless you’re southern. 🥺
The guy who lost his sheep had a hint of scouser about him
I went back to check some older videos to be sure, and while I always registered Jack as being from Ireland, I've never struggled with his accent. I kinda wish I had examples of his accent back in the early early days, where he was doing what amounted to an American accent (I've not been around that long, to be clear). That said, I've always been decent with accents, and I didn't struggle with many of the Irish accents in this video (sheep dude was something else though, felt like I'd have better luck if I understood Irish Gaelic).
This video was hilarious. I would absolutely sign up for more of these.
the fact that the Australian accent ranked 5th "good aye sexy"
I'm not an Irish, but i am amazed i understood them
Ppl actually think we say flor Oil sorr😵
i was legit watching snatch yesterday
I think I have an accent just from watching this video
That very thick accent is more ancient northern Germanic than anything else. You can hear that it is a continental Germanic accent, it sounds Scandinavian (a sub ethnicity of Germanic) which makes sense given they colonized Scotland and Ireland and disposed of the indigenous inhabitants circa 800's.
no love for ulster 😞
(11:15) when your English teacher gives you an a in your class test
'I'm a vowel bender' 🤣 chocked on a chip
I feel like the more jack talks about ireland the more his accent comes out
Oh god this video reminds me of when Jack played Overwatch and was kind of disappointed about Moira’s accent when she was first released
If you can’t understand it, isn’t it the best Irish?
I'm here only bc pewds reversed his face reveal
HAHA EAT POOPOO FRANCE
Knowing the “twist” on Wild Mountain Thyme makes me want to cry laughing
The conor mcgregor accent is the most hated lol
i could understand evorone except only a little bit of the sheep farmer. can i get my honorary irish badge now
When she was saying ill my German speaking ass thought she was saying owl
I'm from Derry and dongal and i can't understand him
I love accents, and I'm always striving to make mine more authentic to each region. This is a great video on what not to do for my Irish accent.
Oil show you where ya can go now oil. Actually has me cringing inside myself haha. There are so many different dialects in Ireland that I can’t even understand people half the time. Ah sure look, be grand. Also, Kerry accents can be almost british sounding to being absolutely fucking indistinguishable farmer accents. I had an Irish teacher from Kerry who sounded similar to her.
I’m proud to be Irish  and I’m from Ireland
Woof
We have a lot of different accents and also dialogue , we use slang a lot also which for most who aren't from here makes it 10 times worse to understand lol also from the north to the south the accents are completely different lol
6:05 totally mad that up
The dog when he lies down in that sheep video..  Yeah that is me trying to understand that man's accent.  ThE fEcK aRe Ya SaYiN?
hi
Some of these accents remind me of Newfoundland & Cape Breton, Nova Scotia (where there's lots of Irish ancestry). Apparently most of the Irish Immigrants who settled on Newfoundland came from Waterford, Kilkenny, Tipperary, Wexford, and Cork. The cartoon guy for Cork and the "man with the sheep" definitely sounded like Newfoundlanders 😂. I'm from South Shore Nova Scotia and tend to drop T's (or replace them with the 'sh' sound) and accentuate vowels and R's. Lots of German ancestry over here. And yeah, the dialects change from county to county.. even if it's a 10 min. drive away haha.
Being Scottish, some of these reminded me of the Peterhead accent lol... The trawler men all sound like the guy with the sheep lol
Aye Shur I'll go to the Shuwr
I wonder if any british or irish people can't understand deep southerners
06:46 Fortnite?
Cork and Northside Dublin were 🥵👌
I'm American and this video gives me so much pain.
Why does 19:02 sound like the mmmkay teacher in south park 😂💀
Sorry I'm late to the party, but being Northern Irish this killed me 😂😂😂😂
you just need to wia to hear newfie accents
The only line I remember Brad Pitt saying in snatch is "feed dem dags"
Jacksepticeye: start drinking more milk. me chillin with a glass of milk aswell as a bowl of cereal
im irish but dont really have an accent
Makes me wonder what Japanese or Korean would sound like if they were spoken with Irish accents. Would anyone be able to understand it?
Lol😅😅😅😅
We purposely make our accents more prominent when we're joking around.
Lmao that student sounded like a who from the grinch
How tf did he translate he should get a job as a translator
❤❤
the accent woman made me cringe lol
i understood nothing that farmer said.
That’s one of my favorite scenes in Hot Fuzz, I love you Sean
The facts channel video has RTE host John Sharpson I think! 🇮🇪🇮🇪🇮🇪
The Irish accent is too inconsistent to be imitated. It cannot be measured. It will not be quantified. It will never be understood.
My irish friend literally said "top of the morning till ya" the other day
I've been gone for a year or two, is the "top of the morning" intro not a thing anymore?
Might as well be a new language
He does a better Christopher Walker accent than CW does an Irish accent.
SIR  you have a mouthloud of cavities , you might want to get that checked out. your teeth are gonna fall out
That fucking county louth joke actually hurt, me being in Dublin i don't find dubliner accent neither south nor north strong, like at all
me: oil jack: oil madeline: *œyl*
I get goosebumps listening to north Dublin girl I understand how it’s the sexiest accent now
Whale Oil Beef Hooked
Omg I could go down the rabbit hole of accents for days. That was so much fun. Sean translating the farmer was magical. I kept trying to guess and then would be 99% totally wrong haha.
I just notice, they hardly move there mouth
He's in Sage mode (look at those eyes)
So cringe when someone produce a movie and they don’t dare have a Irish actor ..
trying to do an irish accent is like doing an italian one: don’t. there’s just so many, you’ll get lost
I've always liked Irish accent 😂🖤 I would love to watch a video of sean going full Irish
I have to find it comical that in Walken's world an Irish accent consists mostly of dropping his New England accent
To be fair to Brad Pitt, Guy Ritchie specifically wanted him to be hard to understand as a lark since there had been accent comments about Ritchie's precious movie.
I imagine hearing someone with a thick Irish accent must be like hearing someone speak when you’re having a stroke.
as a irish person myself im cringing at too many of these
why would you ever LEAVE Ireland? I want to move there!
do irish people just not move their mouths when they talk
Your accents still the best one Jackoboy! 🤘
I dont know if its cause I'm half Irish but I can just barely understand the farmer everyone else
Irish accents literally change every 5 miles i imagine people find a Dublin accent more attractive than a Letterkenny one lol
Alternative title: sean giggling over irish accents
When your 3% Irish:
Jypsy Irish different to normal Irish? I can understand the guy mostly.
I’m so glad you put the Ruari video in 🤣🤣🤣
I hate my accent I'm a irish american born in the south so my accent is southern, irish, and american
Do Irish people use punctuation marks?   This is, of course, a legitimate question.
Am I the only person that can actually understand the farmer-  (I'm from Kerry sooo) He has a real spa or a dingle accent 😂
Jeff was…a thing, that happened, and everyone was uncomfortable.
... I'm drinking milk right now ...
As an American, fuck yeah, I just hear, “Ajdhhdhdsusbsbsjaojwlqpwlnrbcnnxeh.”
“Oi”
Even though I'm Irish, I could only understand about half of what the farmer said.
Humor aside, feel sorry for those farmers
I always thought the mad Irishman was speaking Native Irish.
Newfoundland accent on Youtube ...Good luck
I live in NI and I can barely understand the host.
2:20 there is no Jack, only, Gru
*Cries in being Irish but not sounding it*
Yer wans no more from Kerry then I am
Where’s all my Irish people at? 🇮🇪🍀
I loved everything about this video! Been to Ireland twice already and can't wait to go back :)
The fact you can actually UNDERSTAND THAT MAD ACCENT is mind boggling to me. It sounds like he's speaking Yiddish to me, not going to lie.
I have never laughed as hard as I have while listening to that sheep farmer
My ma is from Cork. I blame that for why I mumble so much.
My family is from County Cork and I grew up in Kansas and its hard to understand them sometimes ngl
Christopher Walken needs more cowbell
I must be the only person to ever to be able to  understand that
if i focus i can make out most words but i'm eating and that makes my brain hurt
I can understand maybe 4 words that farmer said....
remind me of Chris Rock......
“That’s just Christopher Walken being Christopher Walken!” I fail to see the problem here
ok but jack saying "the 't' sound is like an 'sh' sound" actually fucking... helped me understand the accent
this is my favorite video on the interest. wow
Is that old guy speaking gealic? Or nah
The people on the Irish side of my family are just as bad as that farmer. At some points I cant understand and i just nod along and hope for the best.
The Spar bag refers to the duo,  The Rubberbandits
Your man from Louth is a terrible example of the Louth accent.
The American woman doing a video on how to do an Irish accent is just wrong on so many levels. It's like the blind leading the blind.
I have somewhat of a good Scottish accent but when it comes to Irish I don't even try.
Why does that Irish schoolboy look like G man
Kinda the same sort of issue with English accents, there's London, but you also have Liverpool, Birmingham, then down south you have Somerset etc...
Jack's impression of Christopher Walkens is better than Christopher Walkens impression of Jack....by a  lot....
"D'ya like Dags?"
2:21 I'd say that's more Arnold Schwarzenegger than Irish x'D
Brad Pitt isn't playing an Irishman, He is playing a gypsy.
wtf is the sheep farmer saying though?
snatch is so good though!!!!
okay I fucking LOVE the Irish accents!
*i'm a vowelbender*
I was at a bar in Burr a few years back and I was talking to the bartender when all of a sudden a guy walked up and interrupted us and to this day I have no Idea what he said but apparently he was speaking english.
What I've learned from this video is that Irish is NOT an English accent. IT'S AN ENTIRE DIFFERENT LANGUAGE !!!!
This is the equivalent of doctors handwriting
they sound like theyre talking backwards
"it's just M, I and fifteen Rs"...that's kind a how I feel bout irish accent
Spend some time in country Australia, especially in farm regions, I grew up here and I still can't understand half of what they say, its gibberish haha
I swear it sounded French at sum point 💀
Very disappointed the Healy raes didn’t make an appearance
The Irish cram everything into one rolling sentence.
It seems that Irish accents are frequently updated by household. Yet no one other Irishman has the patch notes.
I recently found out im from skibbereen 😂
Subbed because jack called me out.
5:32 ITS LIKE HES SPEAKING A DIFFERENT LANGUAGE
I feel you on every Irish town having a different accent - my friend Tadhg (whose mum is Irish, I'm not completely sure where from exactly) met an Irish lady a few years ago from a few towns over (to where his mum used to live) and she told him he was pronouncing his own name "wrong" 😂😂😂
I just cackled through the entire video. Absolutely LOVE Irish accents! 💚 Every stranger we had to ask to get around Dublin was just super kind. When we were completely lost at a bus stop, people just came up to us asking if we were alright or if we needed help with directions. We felt so welcome in this country that we wanna go visit other cities or towns in Ireland ☘️
"He's Jamaican Katleen" ... "He's not Irish, Kathleen, that's a conspearaccie."
I came here from Farmer Michael so this is my first time hearing this cat. I hear a touch of American accent breaking through. He must either watch too many Hollywood movies or US-based gaming channels.
The fact that I understood most of that accent and I've spent most of my life between Derry and Donegal and barely hear thick irish accents like that
I'm glad i can understand everyone clearly, apart from the first farmer i mean i could just missed words out completely
Sometimes when you stream your accent is hardly audible. But every now and then it comes through and then My heart skips a beat. Love the Irish accent. 😍 greetings from Germany.
My dad's Irish and I've watched the young offenders so I'm well trained for an Irish accent
As an Englishman with many UK relatives and having been around the UK, I can confirm that there are SOOO many different English, Welsh, Scottish and Irish accents its insane!
I understood everyone except that farmer im convinced he was speaking in an ancient tongue and we were just cursed
Jack did such a good Christopher walken accent haha
"I don't sound like that"  Yes you do Jack
Man talks with heavy accent  Me: what??  Jack translates  Me: what??
19:21 😂
The New Orleans accent is unique
The Brad Pitt accent sounds an awful lot like a Newfy accent, “b’ys”
if you do more content like this video i’ll be so happy. this type of content where you just talk is really cool.
did i come back from the future or is this a reupload
Just watching this makes me realize how much my Irish and Walsh accident shine through when I talk fast.😂😂😂
yeh you do sound like that a bit jack XD
These thick Irish accents is how I imagine the Scandinavian languages sound like to none Scandinavian people.
10:48 she sounds kinda like she's speaking Italian
Have you ever been to newfoundland? The accent is similar actually..as i found out.. its the same! but slighty different, maybe with a Canadian twist lol ( i found out that many Irish immigrated to the provincem My stepmom is a Mckee! and i didnt realize some of her family was from there.     Anyways, I think that Irish farmer was pretty freaken similar lol. I could not understand a word...and it seemed fast..
That sounded more like "frostbutt"
2:00 He was laughing at the way the lady said "I don't care", I completely forgot about her and I was laughing at the guy who fell in the water
Me, a french speaking person, completly lost 98% of the video :P
I can’t basically understand the rower boys, but those farmers man. It took a good solid couple listens to pick up any of the words lol
I could understand some of them
it sounds like when I adhd space out while someone's talking to me
Alexa: Can you say Garden in Irish? 11:29
My Irish heritage makes me know how to speak in a Irish accent
im sorry i heard german not english😭
Jesus that accent coach was brutal, we sound nothing like that.
i thought french was the most sexiest but whtvr
shouldve just casted tom hiddleston man has an accent for everything
I have a friend who speaks - I think both Irish Gaelic AND Scots Gaelic? But at the very least Irish Gaelic. But he has a naturally very muttery voice so I imagine he's kind of incoherent regardless of skill.
Bring from the south of ireland I can say I sadly understood every word from that farmer 🤦🏻‍♀️😂😂
After spending my entire adolescence with people mispronouncing my maiden name (Mcdonough), I can understand why Irish accents are hard to understand...my name wasn't even one of the hard ones 🤣
I’ve watched this at least 10 times, please make another one I just moved to Ireland and this is great🤣
Dude, that might as well be another frickin language... for the Irish farmer.
You know what? I’m not even surprised if Mr. Tsithigh was actually speaking Irish Gaelic.
The schoolboy sounds like my cousin when he’s drunk 💀💀
Ok Im American full blooded, I could understand almost everyone to an (extent), but the sheep farmer man... it sounded like he was speaking a different language all together
A vowel bender is better than a bowel bender
I'm irish some accents are hard to understand but sure that's why we are so unique
But as actors Jack we just have to do what sounds to other Americans as an "irish" accent so we can get the role : ) Why don't they just hire irish actors? They do hire some, but there are not enough to go around sometimes, particularly at the level that would work for those films that want to garner attention with a "name" or well-known actor.
Me: Hey Sheamus, what does the recipe call for Sheamus: Fleer Me:.... so the recipe calls for baseball cards?
Bradpit isn't trying to sound Irish that's really how English gypsys sound like
Jack:" why can't you get Irish actors!" Now you know how Scots feel man
that farmer sounds like he's having a seizure
wild mountain thyme is an actual hate crime i think
Aw I love facts such a class channel
I'm surprised the automated subtitles can comprehend whats been said. Even the Kerry farmer! oO
I think the guy with the plastic bag on his head was supposed to be one of the Rubberbandits
The fact he stopped at shitting off accents at Aussie accent and I’m Aussie hell yeah
Sean is so right I love hearing vocal coaches do a specific places accent despite those places having several accents and or dialects
Most Irish accents are awful.
"m i, and fifteen r(s)"
i love the way he says "thirty five"
The first one sounds more Scottish than irish.... is that just me or am I being dumb? 😂
I'm Australian and can understand most of it.
New Zealand has a better accent. I'm a New Zealander.
Im freckin Irish and that farmer done a number on my brain. 🤣🤣🤣
I'm not Irish but I actually kind of understood the accents in that news video (but I had to listen to it a few times until my brain figured out how it works) lol
"Your accent is so strong" Sean Mac an tSithigh: Am I a joke to you?
When you aren’t Irish but you understand Avery lick of the accent.
While not Irish, my dads side of the family have very heavy Newfie accents(Newfoundland, CA) and most conversations with them have me just have me saying "yep, cool, or huh thats neat" because I can't understand them aside from some words.
if i unfocus my ears i realize just how un-understandable it is
Okay hear me out......the Canadian Newfoundland accent is similar to the Irish accent. My whole family is Newfie and I feel like the really strong accents are like a weird mash of Scottish, Irish, and a really drunk English person lol
Sean's Walken was better than Walken's Irish accent 😂
6:36 Yes! That's the first thing I thought of. Edgar Wright nailed that scene, needing a translator for a translator for weird unrecognizable regional accents.
Definitely can hear the Irish in the Newfie accent. They're equally hard to understand sometimes.
He’s translating a thick Irish accent with a less thick Irish accent 🤨 at least I can understand Sean 😂
Wel the d'mullers Schuller mafstutermc going along gettin frostbut
My family is from Yorkshire England. I understood some parts of his sentences but Irish is extremely different from my accent.
Now I'm beginning to question how Irish people communicate with each other...
the greatest thing about the Irish accent is that pretty much every Irish person grew up speaking English, and yet the accent itself so separate from any majorly English-speaking country it's beautiful
There is a different accent in Ireland for every mile on the island
I understood very little of that mans words in the 3rd video
I'm the same with the southern accent. Mine is from Texas, because of my mom, but because I live up north I usually don't have it. Whenever I listen to someone with a southern accent or country music, I have it back for a while and it surprises people that haven't heard it before
*Jack doing an exaggerated impression of himself* *Me* : Show me the difference
As someone who's first language isn't English, I thought that farmer was speaker a complete foreign language. Could not grasp a word for the life of me! Even Brad Pitt wasn't making any sense to me. Thanks Sean for the translation xD
I was planning on watching it as I saw it at the movies when watching wonder women 87
Went to Dingle in County Kerry last year for a wedding. I would be outside of a pub and someone would walk up to me and I would just nod my head and think to myself, "What in the name of god is this guy saying?"
Every time I thought I understood something jack translated and I was completely wrong
Jack a more Irish town name is clonakilty
Make it oughta a potatoe.
What I see here is an American sounding Irish lad taking the piss out of people who have real Irish accents.
I feel like no matter how good your accent impression is, the people who were born with that accent won’t like it.
All the english I've learned has been a lie
can we just appreciate how good Jacksepticeye‘s Christopher Walken impersonation is
11:39  From Northern Ireland.  Can confirm.  Mirror = mur
When he was explaining what which type of time he should have said meme  Time 🤣
This is the most entertaining time I have had while not understanding 45% of it.
This video had me dying
Jamaican and cork Irish accent are almost identical.
Wicklow accent on fleek 👌
The irish accent when in full bloom is the hardest thing to understand. I can understand scottish accents far easier than that monstrosity, but I love it!
I'm not from Ireland in any way other than genetics, nor could I ever do a good irish accent, and I knew that was horrible.
I grew up watching a lot of Monty python and comedians with cockny accents so I can understand a lot of this style of talking. So I showed a friend of mine a jon Richardson routine (figured it was easiest to hear) and they couldnt follow because of the accent. Even watching boondock saints they were lost. It was funnier watching them trying to decipher what was said.
I was actually able to translate some of what the farmer was saying 0.0
I've watched wild mountain thyme, don't do it to yourself .
Brad Pitt was doing a traveler accent, he was a traveler in Snatch.
Funny <3
Thats a limerick.accent if ive ever heard one
I’m Irish and I can’t even understand the oufella
Jack, I love you, but when you said fuck you Italy, all I could think of is "VAFFANCULO" Lmfao
The Irish farmer's accent reminds me of how thick the Appalachian southern accent is!
That was actually a good walken jack
How the hell is Australian 5th on the sexiest language list?
Richie Griffin sounds like Daithi...
Christifer walken sounds like the god darn terminator
Dudes accent is thick but if I close my eyes I understand it
my great grandad was from tobbercurry/tubbercurry
in the video of "how to do an irish accent" when she tried to say flover i tought she said flare :,D
Ireland the land of ire
It's so weird I kinda understand half of what the heavy accent lads are talking about as a Dutchman
Me who’s Irish and Australia 👁👄👁 I can’t understand either
i could actually understand them mostly
Every person who’s ever gotten a vocal lesson from that voice coach should get a refund.
The farmer sound chense
Love how you’ve stopped shouting! Been watching you more since playing among us, was never a fan when you was aiming at younger viewers with kids shots and screams haha! Love the new vibe
"Irish people are just build different, aren't they?" It's called Fetal Alcohol Syndrome
I think a lot of Americans can't distinguish between Northern Ireland and Dublin, so there's no chance they could perceive the specific sounds in Killarney.
Sure yer man from Kerry was just abit disappointed about his sheep being gone that's all. I understand him completely (I've Kerry blood in me and I go there alot so I'm used to the accent) Also yer wan teaching an Irish accent is all wrong
Why do we need the dog? It's not the dog we need. 5:05
The fact that my blood actually got going when he said it would at the top of the video 😰❤️❤️
Honestly, Jack, your accent sounds like it’s lost some of its strength since your move. I’ve never had any difficulty understanding you. 🤷‍♀️
@ 16:41 love this accent.
Literally sounds like a different language
There is something about an Irish accent that just gets a girl going.
Nobody: Jack: WHAT THE FOCK JEFF? Me: *dies laughing*     My humor is messed up istg 💀
When they started wi the diddly music I was like plz don't play anymore itl attract the old fellas who's all steaming 😭😂 the ol sheep fella reckons someone snuck up there coz of a full moon I'm dead 🐑🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂🎑
didnt brad pit play a irishman in the devils own
Looking at this comments I never realised that ya, are accent is so hard to understand.
I only understood him because I’m lived there for 5 years
Coming from the south of Ireland and having two grandads it’s actually very easy to understand that sheep farmer
what kinda accent does Jack hav?
4:00 I had same feeling when I as a Russian first heard Bulgarian language
Should try to understand Newfoundland accents
You should listen to strong Scottish accents, it’s the funniest 💩 ever
Dude this guy is freaking hilarious! 😂🤣
Scottish is Well better pal
0:23 as a italian thats offensive to my spaghetti culture country race
lol That sounds like my Buddy when he gets mad playing a Video Game, he goes off in Irish and none of us understand lol
Why does the schoolboy look like the gman from half life ? Is that just me
As a Norwegian, these thick Irish accents are easier to understand than the goddamn Scandinavian language called Danish.
I’m from limerick and a lad from school guessed my exact town by now I sound
Jack translating the farmer , to an Irish person is very impressive
How come Jack did a better imitation of Christopher Walken doing an Irish accent than Christopher Walken did.
I gotta hide from that boy
Havagooddaggan 06:45
05:05 i live for this so much
Tbf.. Brad Pitt on snatch is not exactly irish
I rate brad pitt trying to do a traveller accent
irish people: iabvfakj cisnvic vhuavugaj other irish people: *understands perfectly what he was saying*  every other culture: WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU ON ABOUT WHATS THIS GIBBERISH
I'm American. I've been picked on for how I say mirror my whole life. Apparently I say mirror like an Irish person 🤷🏻‍♀️

"The Irish accent is the sexiest accent."  Totally agree!
Honestly, the Rowers were the easiest to understand in my opinion xD
All the fucking Gaelic, man.
couldn't understand most of what them farmers said and i'm irish myself
Tir gan teanga, tir gan anam.
Why tf did my German ass actually understand the dude with the missing sheep like ?
White people don't realize that there are also some ridiculous Mandarin Chinese accents out there.
Sean im sorry but michael martin isnt lettin you back lad
Farty-Five!
I feel like the sheep farmer is the Irish equivalent of a thick Cajun accent in America
As an Irish person from Cork i can understand all of these but this is soo funny hehehe.
"Mikey Joe O'Shea" is the epitome of Anglicised Irish names, yet the guy with that name couldn't sound more Irish unless he started actually speaking Irish 😂
I love Irish accents-
the lady teaching the Irish accent was so calming idk why
11:02  She is onto something, I had an accent coach who taught me the ‘o’ thing. It’s a generalized accent, not dialect-influenced. Your accent is much more majestic, Sir Sean
It sounds hobbit.
Before watching this video I thought mumble rap was bad.  Now I realize its just a heavy Irish accent.
12:18 Exactly how I feel when people try to emulate the "Indian" accent. With more than 19,500 mother tongues throughout the country, the accent of even native languages can change within different areas of a city. It's so difficult to watch American movies without wincing at the Indian accent forced on to actors who naturally have an American accent.
my friend i physically cant even hear your accent
I found out something today. city Irish I can understand but if I get lost in the country way out in the boondocks I'm screwed because I wouldn't be able to understand anyone
JacksepticUUIIye
oh god deadly spoilers you made, lol
Being Irish myself, I-I can't
Christopher Walken sounds like he's trying to do a Scottish accent, not an Irish one. And he's failing at that too.
Glasgow
When the rowers were talking and Jack started laughing,  I laughed too pretending to know exactly what's happening😬
fact about brad pitt he spent a few months with a gypsy family before filming snatch
Wait.... is Nogla from Limerick? Because that was very Nogla sounding
as someone who's irish, i have no idea wtf the guy on the news was saying lmfao
Being an American that goes Irish when I stub my toe, this is pretty weird
The Irish accents in Snatch aren’t supposed to be understandable. There’s literally a part in the script where it’s “indiscernible”
Hilarious! And the Christopher Walken impersonation was flawless. :-)
‘Ere young jacka-boy. Don’ ye be talkin’ none o’ yer fancy horse shite about ol’Christopher. Else ya might come a’ cropper.
What about Jin from yu yu hakusho
Learning English through YouTube (aka just binge watching YouTubers) is really fucking up my speech and accent. British, American, Scottish, Irish, and many more...god help me
"Ha ha, eat shit, _france_ "
Italian still better
Did someone say something bout someone speaking garlic
I wouldn’t say I necessarily find Irish accents attractive, but they make me happy lol. I enjoy listening to people with Irish accents.
I've watched him for so long I don't even register the accent 🤣
When he mentioned the movie hot fuzz it's very underrated. Very gud movie 👁️👄👁️👌
5:40 the old man sounds like he's from japan
I’m from kerry and lmfao I guarantee that one is not from ciarraí boi
I honestly thought I understood what the thick accent guy said then Jack translated  👁👄👁
I actually loved this i was laughing the whole way through
Jacksepticwhydoesheexist... let me answer that if any of you are wondering, he is THE GEALIC GLADIATOR...THE...GEALIC GLADIATOR
*American.exe has stopped working*
How the hell was I actually kinda able to know what that farmer was saying
brad pitts not trying to be irish its a gypsy accent which is a bit different from an irish one
Is it just me or can any body else kind of understand the mad accent guy
react to the boondock saints
My godmother has an Irish accent, nowhere near the level of these guys but I don’t even understand her sometimes
I LITERALLY love you bro. You and lugwig are my greatest finds of among us lmfaoooooo
Subtitles are really necessary in this video
when he did the English accent i felt pain
"Haha eat shit France" is the most British thing I've ever heard, and from someone that isn't British but Irish
In the french version of snatch, brad pitt's caracter is a gypsy, not irish ???
why does the farmer sound like he's speaking welsh?!
Snatch is a modern day masterpiece and no one can convince me otherwise
Dude, Icelandic news be like: a lamb was born early
it doesn't even sound like english anymore. Its more not English than jeju dialect isn't korean and jeju is bad enough to practically be considered another language.
Pls do kildare next time
Everybody gangsta till the rocks and hills start speaking gaelic
i thought he said we r in Riyadh LMAO it was Rio 8:52
There’s no way that Irish farmer was speaking English
🥔
Should have done the one from The Gentleman
the more i listen to this the more i realise that southrn isnt that different from irish it still is very different tho
We don't say oirland, we say aarland. Or iiiiarrrland.
When your fave youtuber mentions skibb and you love there ❤️
The first guy in the mad accents video I couldn't understand at all and was very impressed that you understood him. The second guy though who said "all you need is a good dog", that one I could understand
flower=flare
extreame irish accent sound like english and danish combined
Pretty sure the farmer had stroke
NGL sometimes you go full Irish and it can be hard to understand you if I didn't have Irish friends
At 19:20 he paused the video and i legit didn't even notice 😂
Nowadays, Jack's accent is almost American at this point. Sometimes I forget he's Irish in recent videos and idk how to feel about that.
Why could I understand the farmer. It’s the Irish in my blood
WHAT THE FUCK !!!!  JEFF !!!!
I can actually understand a majority of these accents tho 😂
2:20 That just sounded like Arnold Schwarzenegger lmao
Is it bad that I'm Australian and I can understand 90% of what the strong Irish are speaking?
12:57 that “What the FOCK Jeff” sent me harder than any accent in the whole video
Jack: Makes an Irish accent video  Jack: Does a fake English accent  Me a Londoner: Ey?
Mirrrrrrrrrrrrrrr 15😁
The stronger the accent gets the more it starts to sound like a run on sentence with zero punctuation marks 😂
Kevin did it 1st
"Ohhh you wanted someone from Kerry? I thought you wanted someone naaamed Kerry."
The thing is, if you listen to Irish people speaking Gaeilge, the native language, the accent makes a LOT more sense.
His accent getting stronger through out the video is just awesome!
Jacks accent began with the soft poetic sounds of Northern Dublin to gradually getting thicker the more videos he went through. 😂😂
Over FARTY-FIVE Sheep Have Been Stolen.
I’ve grown up and worked around a handful of Irish people and I’ve got to say Cork/West Cork folk got the best accent in the country.
The Cork accent will forever be the greatest accent of all time, I challenge you to try change my mind
Jack trying to be Christopher walkin trying to be Irish = Arnold Schwarzenegger
I could understand the school boy?
Ruairi McShorley or "Frostbit boy" is Northern Irish, very petty thing to bring up but needed to be said
Jack doing an impression of Christopher Walker trying to be Irish sounds exactly like Gru
Me a Welshman who can understand every word because the Irish and Welsh evolved from sheep:
8:50 "Whats the crack ?" 9:15 Dude.. He is on the crack.. XD
Kathleen
Fully thought I was listening to like Scandinavian on the sheep one
I feel sad that Waterford gets ignoref
Irland all the way! And yet I’m yet I’m Swedish
When Jack ends the video just as that guy was about to get to northern irish accents ;(
I loved this! A lot of your videos I feel like I’m just watching you do something, but this one feels like we actually just hung out, had a bit a fun, and you shared a dear part of you. Get back home and enjoy it sometime cause you clearly love it.
One minute in and I'm losing it.  I appreciate that you were the least rude to Scotland in your victory dunks.
you can even see the rowers lips moving couldn't figure out which one was talking
i live in cork so i can understand the accents around carrightwohill and glanmire
i live in ireland and i can say for sure that in donegal the accent is so strong
Táim chun tú a mharú agus tú a cheilt san íoslach mura liostálann tú le jacksepticeye
Sean: down in county Kerry in then south me from Kerry: Sean Kerry is the south west
Born in Texas but I have Irish in me. I found my family crest.
it feels weird that i kiiiiinda understood the reallt irish guy at like 5:00
I was drinking milk at the moment, he said that, RIP keyboard got milked on... Spit it all out
When you think about it "Minx Simps" probably contributed to most of the votes for Sexiest Account 2020 was a wild ride...
13 years in Ireland and I can't even understand a word from the sheep farmer...
I could not imagine understanding the farmer, thank you for translating
9:08 I can understand this babbling more than the other babbling.
froshbutt
7:30 Why does this give me life? 11:37 This too. 18:17 This to the end.  XD I laughed so much while watching this. Love it.
jack you're from athlone. you know right well brad pitts accent was the perfect traveller accent. jaysus you used to live 10 minutes away from the big joe joyce
Yours is the best accent 👌💜
As a Canadian we have preliminary training for understanding a heavy Irish accent, especially in Alberta and out east. They're called Newfies. The first guy with the sheep, not a chance, the guy getting on the bus, got most of it 🤣🤣
I REALLY want to go to Ireland some day, it just seems like a really fun place to be.
Irish accents just make me feel very comfortable, calming, and safe idk why
Having been in West Ireland and hearing lots of them speak, when they say the the word f..king...... which in the local pubs they say a lot..... they say fogkin ..........kinda.🤔😏. Interspersed with the declaration upon entrance to the pub “Bless all with within”.   They also commonly speak Gaelic to each other.
Does any other Irish family say dooor
Jack trying to do a northern Irish accent is hilarious
I'm Canadian and I understood lots of them. The time I find I have a hard time understanding is when they aren't moving their mouths/lips while they talk so effectively they are muttering, so of course they are hard to understand. Short of that I didn't have to much problem other than an occasional word here or there. I even understood the muttering guy who talked having to take a doping test and then he urinated in the pool.
The farmer sounds so much like my late Granddad! He got worse with age as he reFUSED to turn his hearing aids on
OI OI OI I live in Scotland
2:21 sounded more like Christopher Walken than Christopher Walken did lol good job
I'm a Dublin boy so not a chance I understood anything that farmer was saying
It's funny how I can understand them but I'm Australian 😂
As an Irish person I am proud that I could understand what they said with some clarity
Ive actually always found the irish accent hotter than the british accent
Not Irish atal atal
I thought I spoke english
I love it. All of it.   Sean...bender of vowels!
THE LIMERICK AND CORK ACCENTS ARE SO ACCURATE
"I'm a vowel bender" 11:15 Brilliant
The more of these I watch, the more I understand.  Maybe I have Irish in my blood.
I'm Irish and this is the most cringe vid
Jacks eyes look like he went into to sage mode from naruto
This cheered me up no end! Anyway, must go and have a shave and look into the mirrrrrrrrrrrrrrr!
I feel this as an Australian trying to translate an okka accent or hearing someone trying to do an Australian accent 😂
Is it weird I understood all of the farmers and the dudes from the interview, I’m not from there, nor even heard. So it’s weird I guess, I don’t know.
the irishman sounds like he’s speaking another language
Jack is the only person I know with a real irish accent. Either way his is the best-
The guy from lymarick is the maker of the song "I've a horse outside" It's great. Yes he does wear a spar bag on his head.
Me, an indian, approves this.
Jack: stops the video near my county me: ffs UP DONEGAL!!!
I have watched Jacksepticeye so much that I can't hear Seán's accent
Holy crap, his Christopher Walken was amazing. He did a better job doing that than Walken did being Irish :D
sean: county kerry has the maddest accents me, from kerry: 👁👁
I love everything about the Irish accent, Ireland, just everything. Cork is my fav! I have family that still lives in Ireland but I’ve never been.
I’ve always said that... why don’t they just cast the people who actually HAVE an accent instead of Americans trying to speak in an Irish accent.
I'm not convinced that you aren't secretly Leather Jacket Guy
Brad Pitt fools you with his intonation but if you listen closely he's not pronouncing the words the way an Irish person, from Ireland would.
"Hey mom, can we get Conor McGregor?" Mom:"no we have Conor McGregor at home." Conor McGregor at home: 8:50
interesting..closed caption almost kept up with the sheep herder but could not make out most of Brad Pitt's words.
I want more of this.. i want more
That's exactly how minorities feel when white people are casted as another ethnicity
Jack where you from in Ireland 🇮🇪 I’m from cork.. not much of an accent though because I grew up in Britain 🙇
5:12 I could translate that to German better than any other language
Australian number 5 huh Hmm  I mean i was playing siege and decided sledge myers (operator named sledge, you know it, has a sledge hammer, basically he runs around and hits people with the hammer) and they heard me and said "Where do you come from thats a sexy voice" They were simping for me like jack and corpse does to sykunno And toast
the guy with the spar bag was a rubber bandit, you don't know who the rubber bandits are, you have now forfeited your citizenship
Yup, I'm headed to Southern Ireland just to be completely confused knowing I'm listening to English.  Pass the whiskey.
You’re lucky I can understand YOUR accent when you speak. The farmer was something else entirely
My favourite was jacks one
I never thought I would need a translator for my own language, English. 😂😂
My mother knows the first sheep farmer.
Im starting to belive that jack and minx are the only 2 irish people on the world. God save me
Bru I’ve been subscribed since you been livin in that cabin behind ur parents house
I was born and raised in Ireland, Dublin and the only accent I have is ( Dublin /only when mad )
ballyhaunis what a town  would u be listening to Midwest out in england sean
The further into these videos, the stronger Jack's accent gets😂
Yeah jedward
That farmer sounds like the Irish version of little Jacob from gta 4
My mind : that guy that won the Olympics sounds like nugget from that school game
"haha eat shit france" lmao
I might only be less than a third Irish, but I understood all those heavy accents. My blood must be strong for the Emerald Isle.
Fake Irish accents sound as horrible as fake Boston ones, almost painful to listen to.
Thay should've use the cast of derry girls cuz there actually irish
Sean imitating Christopher Walken is doing better job than Christopher Walken being Irish xD
Sean Why Did You Skip The Northern Irish Accent
15:32 Thats where my nana died
How dare you make fun of the Limerick accent
That Kerry woman was not irish
When I first saw that farmer video, I actually thought he was speaking Gaelic.
jack's was the best accent
I hate it. I have to listen to it pretty much everyday.. But you don't see it all the time in places like Limerick or Dublin.
Us irish are bilingual
I'm from irland and I understand irish accent better than english
The second farmer was so much easier to understand than the first. If you concentrate and listen very carefully you can just about make out what the first farmer is saying.  I can imagine if English is not your first language then you’d not understand a word.
Potato?
Long time wasn't here, cheers mate.
3:25 i have watched that. They aren't Irish they are gypsys. Its a different thing
I understand perfectly because of my uncle (the actual Irish farmer)
I love the pick up lines <3
So when are we actually tier-listing bad character accents and when will we see Angel from Buffy put at the top.
I was just having dinner and the mack & cheese smelt like ....SHIT....i smelt ut and it felt like i could taste? It..i feel so sick....(i dont know how to spell taste)
Jack's reaction is making me die in laughter
Yeeeeah, that last guy sounded Scottish of I’m not mistaken
When your Irish but can’t do an Irish accent😞
Your Irish
Jack must've heard Horse Outside by the Rubberbandits (Limerick animation), they're genius
Some random guy called Jeff: "I kinda like irish accecent, but it doesn't turn me on." Jack: "Whatda fock, Jeff!? Sexiest accent in the world, didn't we see that in the start of the video!?"
Irish people talking: -"Pojoip huimp nfuio nfiw nufuhfwvbhd hufiwbg rufeo fiwj."   Irish people having a seizure talking: -"Pojoip huimp nfuio nfiw nufuhfwvbhd hufiwbg rufeo fiwj."   How do they distinguish it? Just kiddin' eheh
You guys have a great accent.....but fuck me, I can't understand a word of what some of these people are saying - and I am Australian.
Wait till ya hear Filipino accents...
Im french sean and you re perfectly understandable.  However theses guys on the videos are just mumbling to me tbh.
I can't believe this was made one month ago it feels like years ago
I love how you laugh your ass off every time. XDD Makes it even more entertaining.
The more this video went on, I felt like I could understand it better.
terty tree
One day I hope to go to Ireland. Since I'm a ginger everyone always asks if I'm Irish (I am but that doesn't matter). The red hair comes from my dad's side which is Scottish, my mom's side is from Ireland.
What did you say
I actually have never heard  Christopher Walken's voice. I only know how he talks bc of the several youtubers that always make fun of him. (Btw my main language is Spanish so every movie that I saw with him in it was dubbed in Spanish)
If you invade Ireland, I'm totally in
I think that jack went school for a minute
I never knew how much I needed something in my life before
Ive been watching to many irish peoples channels and I’ve actually started to say shit like I’m Irish.
Farty Five lmaooo God I love the irish
"Sure ye wouldn't be long gettin frostbit" is what I have to deal with everyday, I'm Irish and I can't understand these people 😭😭
The show Outlander has great accents don’t think it’s Irish I think it’s Scottish....I’m not good at being able to tell the difference between accents so please don’t come at me >.< but the accent the main guy has BOMB
Couldn't understand a word but sounded very cool.And it's totally sexy!
Even me as an irish person can hardly ever understand Kerry it's just special
I try but im a tiny bit irish. Still not great at it though.
Im a irish man
I remember seeing that farmer video and not understanding anything when I first moved to Ireland. 3 years later and I got almost every word lmao
I feel like the American southern accent can be similar to Irish. Which historically makes some amount of sense
Jack with the sheep guy be like everyone who understands groot when he says, "I am groot"
The south is good but the south east is the crack
I hate it when people try to do an irish accent. I went to America last year and the accent sounded like a German trying to sound Scottish
I must have been from Ireland in another life, because I was able to understand most of what the farmer was saying. I'm from Northern Arizona in the U.S., aka "The Old West", but I've always wanted to travel to Ireland, and I've always had a deep love of its history, culture, music, and accents. When I was little, I watched my VHS of Riverdance until the whole thing had been so worn down, the picture wasn't fully visible anymore.
im from malaysia..but for some reason i understand what they were saying..is that weird?
the sheep farmer sound like an irish live action grinch
pretty sure the sheep had an easier time understanding the farmer than i had :/
Lol! "wtf Jeff! Sexiest accent in the world! Didn't you see the beginning of this video!?"
Hey buddy just wanted to point out your error in translation of the farmer he said lambs within the sheep or something to that effect, he meant he had pregnant ewes. Not lambs and ewes stolen
The how to do a an Irish accent was cringe because I am irish😠
Some of These pickup lines in "which Irish accent is the sexist" sounded like they were coming from a leprechaun, 😂😂😂😂  pot of gold  and lucky charms, love it .
Translation for 5:05   Beiohmereahteyaheh..
to be fair....we do have strange fuckin accents
Imagine getting millions of views and just be chill about it.
Seán: Irish Accent Is Friggin Hard to impersonate Scottish People: Am I A Focking Joke Tae Ya?
There was no reason this video would be this funny 😂
Was he talking Japanese?😂
Hahahaha  12 years in Ireland lol I use to translate my Irish colleges to American tourists 😂
I did my dialect project at my acting school on "irish" and its so true!! There are soooooooo many styles and variations trying to pin it down to a generic dialect is impossible :P this video is gold 💜💜💜💃
There was puns about lucky charms but I have never seen them where I am in Ireland
It took me awhile to understand what your intro was back in the day. No idea how I didn’t understand top of the morning to you!
Child of an Irish immigrant to the States here- Irish people Jack’s age and younger commonly have less thick regional accents, kind of cool
The cartoon Cork accent made me LOSE IT 😂
I'm fully convinced that farmer started off speaking Gaelic  edit: yes, I realize its called Irish, but I'm gonna keep it as Gaelic out of spite to everyone tripping over themselves to correct me over and over again.
Every county has an accent some of them can be slightly different but others are just mad
Something I rember reading is that, during a Scotland VS Ireland football game, the opposing fans shouted at each other with "we hate England more than you"
I feel like this is what English sounds like to non English speakers
I am so thankful for jack translating those stronger accents. I also always knew that jacks accent wasn’t very strong in comparison to what someone thinks of when they think of an Irish accent (unless he’s playing with the lads), however I thought I would stand a chance against some of the stronger accents in this video. I was so freaking wrong. It sounded like a completely different language, like actual Gaelic or something.
tá se go hánaigh
as an irish person, yes.
We say “mirror” the same way in the Midwest tbh
Is it just me that finds it weird that british accents were high on the 'sexy' list, we have so many accents in good old UK but only one is 'sexy' the poshos accent. Ya know like Tom Hiddleston style? (random example)
The Irish accent sounds like a mixture of the English accent and the word “Argh!” - like a pirate.
7:57 notice the way jack says thick hahah he's irishin' it up lads
2:21 Gru? Is that u?
I find this so funny lol Brad pitt’s Irish accent came about because he couldn’t do the British one, so they had him okay character and I always thought he did such a good job. Guess not though.
Lol the American voice coach trying to teach people to speak with an Irish accent saying "In English we say..." then proceeds to say it in American.  Later on when the woman talks with the Southside Dublin accent talks to the male Yank and he say's he didn't pay attention to what she said because her accent was so strong.....I mean, come on...that is not difficult to understand. You want a hard accent go North across the border to Belfast.
18:53- is South Dublin suppose to sound like Ringo Starr ????
I'm irish so I understood everything easily
I'm an American from the South I don't really feel I have an accent until I travel elsewhere in these great states and it gets pointed out I can spot a fake one in movies right away though. Like that 'Knives Out' movie with Daniel Craig I mean what the fuck was that???  🤣
I say mirror as merr
you do a better christopher walken than christopher walken does irish thats for sure
Kerry had the best accent, could be bias since I'm from  kerry we might as well have our own language ti's so hard to understand for people
Lol
One time awhile ago I asked you jack if you were gay and you said no but if I was why would it be a issue or something like that. And I wanna say I wasn’t judging you I was just curious as a fan sorry for making you feel like you had to lie. Have a blessed 2021 pimp
10:46 I was expecting her to say: WELL BAI ANY CRAIC DID YA SEE YER MAN AT THE MART OOH BE JESUS HE DID WELL TO GET THE CATTLE AT THAT PRICE UP MAYO
I'm actually Irish and I can't understand a word
Do the Irish speak in semi-understandable wingdings?
That video on how to do an Irish accent is literally just how we speak in Birmingham.  Is she the reason all Americans/Canadians think my accent is Irish 😂
I have auditory processing disorder and this is what regular english sounds like to me half the time lol. Closed Captions are a lifesaver
You gotta watch the full length of that frostbut kid. It’s hysterical 🍀
dA HhHhHhHhErB
Im from kildare so the accents are shite but im in the countryside so youd hear "ahshureerewasfifteencattlemissinfrommefarmyesterday"
School boys accent though
i like the number farty five
Farty five sheep missing lol
Subtitles make it funnier lol
Meanwhile in America: an Irish & Scottish American watches videos of the homeland while the USA is burning and infected.  lol. Stay safe y'all!
lmfao when that blonde one who is suppose to be from Kerry came on I instantly said tf is she english or something, I'm from Kerry and we don't sound like that
In Australia we talk really fast too and get told to slow down
Why is the aussie accent there.. i hate how i sound 😂
Farty five
The horse had a spot on Irish accent!
You asked if you actually sound like that. Sometimes yes. You sound like the lucky charms mascot or a movie/tv exaggerated version of an Irish person. But that's ok. Do you Jack.
Sean try doing an English accent
32 counties on this island and each county as about 1 or 2 different accents
6:43 “Gottogettheuse of a good dog, good dog, fortnite”
As an Australian who often gets told the accent is sexy, this video was just delightful 😊
This is what the local news in Delaware is like 😂
In hot fuzz, he was saying, "whats he moaning about"?
I’m from Cork and I understood every word the O’Donovan brothers were saying...
THE IRISH man: Aryabuiiandjakjcamjwbaojdiawf! Jack: Oh he said he lost 45 sheep!
At one point I stoped understanding both jack and the man with the stolen sheep hella weird
No way....my Japanese wife's accent is the sexiest.....
"eat shit france" me:they probly would
Jack: MEEWWzik ya coll it?! 🤣😂
Hearing a fake accent and knowing what the real accent sounds like is true torture.
Donegal accents arent mentioned at all.  Pure job now jack lad, cunts be bollocks.
Sounded Irish to me, I hate when people try an pull an American Southern accent, they never get it right.
The way Jack just yelled “park” and “garden” was the most Irish thing I’ve ever seen
D4 accents are so funny sounding
The culchie accent tho
11:33 I mean yeah.. u irish af
By the olympics video I could understand them 😂😂
He has a spar bag on his head because it's the rubber bandits
That farmer spoke what?!!!windows shutdown noises
If you can,  don't come to Ireland. Ireland: a corrupted land, leading in drug distribution/ dealer/ users across Europe, very high accommodation prices, homelessness, addictions, abuses, dishonest (some corrupt) politicians, and some what "lazy police": Gov' do not wish to upgrade or improve policing, security, in Dublin, Ireland.. 👎😞 do your research!
19:19 I actually didn’t realise Sean paused it
What?? Italian, French, Swedish and Spanish are way more attractive than some Dublin accent to me.   Nothing personal Jack, great accent in many ways. Just not sexy to me, unless it's Saoirse Ronan or something, then it's over.
I am Irish and I barely understand anyone in this video
I ain’t got thyme for that movie.
Irish sounds like a rollercoaster ride of a sentence without any spaces between words.
Well Jack I live in Ireland Co. Cork fermoy were you live
I'm Irish and trust my friends try Irish accent and they mess up
Even a real Irish accent just sounds absolutely dreadful 🤭 😜😂
All I hear from you that sounds weird to say is arrrrrrrrr  Y9u say lots of rrrrrs
I understood like half the words that farmer said but when he was talking about having a good dig, I heard "you just gotta take a jog every once and a while you know, get some moonshine, jog with em, an everything gonna be okay"
Bring the og hat back
Anyone think about Chris Hemsworth trying to do a Irish accent in the Hunsman?
As a Cork native i can confirm that at least half if not more of the people in the country sound like that also that last one was fecking brilliant
Irish accents are just as varied as German accents
'Sexiest Accents 2019:' Jack, you've gotta update your sources. What if Swedish is the next sexiest accent? But I agree with the 2019 source. Irish accents are sexy.
"In an Irish accent it's like we're smiling..." Drunk already, are ye?
That BRIEF moment of Jack having Airbender Arrow on the head, 'I'm a vowel bender" I'm DYING LOL!!
Ireland is Munster and Connacht.           The rest is the UK Part 2. *Sips potín*
Jack should teach us his Irish accent
It's not that different from Old English. Someone who can speak Old English should easily conquer Irish.
I tried to do an Irish accent but it started to sound Scottish the same thing happened when I tried to do an Australian accent :')
Jackcepticeye has the same name as me that feels good
The woman trying to teach an Irish accent looks like she'd sell essential oils to cure Corona.
County Clare is the best county
6:44  "Avagudag" "Avagudaggan"
Why don't the rowers move their mouths?...
that farmer reminded me of my grandad
"yeah I'm a vowel-bender"
Sorry Sean the best accent is the native American accent hahaha
I live in Dublin ireland and I went to skelligs in Kerry (where stare wars was filmed yes it was filmed in a small island in ireland) well there is an AMAZING chocolate factory and you can make your own chocolate mmmmmmmmm well the mountains look just like the ones in the video
I don't speak tungs
Oh boy the Cork accents can be the hardest sometimes, I have cousins from Cork and their father has such a thick accent that I actually no joke can't understand him most of the time
God I love being Irish
When you can understand the farmer perfectly 👁👄👁
This is amazing
Leonardo DiCaprio's Irish accent in gangs of New York was so bad.
Im Irish and I can't even do the accent 🤣
The Brad Pitt one wasn't Irish it's Travellers. When you said it kinda sounds Irish but not that's what Travellers sound like 😂
As an Irish American I'd like to say i've asked my relatives to teach me how to talk in an Irish accent, and I've failed MISERABLY.
“it’s just m, I, and a bunch of fuckin r’s” same w my texas accent lmao
Don't drink milk and go to bed, go to the pub and drink a pint of Guinness
The Olympic rowers sounded really drunk😂
Came across this vid by accident, but had the most fun ever... 😂
Me: “That’s some good accent”  Jack: “That doesn’t sound Irish”  Me: 👁👄👁  Edit: OMG. Thanks for 1k likes. My previous record was only 300 likes. 😍😍
OHHHHH Brad Pitt you’re lucky you’re GoRgeous
5:06 for half of this clip I thought he was talking a different language
Not sure how accurate the accent is but "The Young Offenders" is great tv show set in Cork
Frosebutt
Some areas of Atlantic Canadian, particularly Newfoundland, would have zero problem understanding some of the really thick Irish accents 😂
"Farty-five" :D
Farty faive? Jesus that's a lot a sheep gon messan
i see you avoided trash talking ausrailia
Heres what's funny when i speak it comes out as a Italian, Brooklyn, staten island but when I sing it comes out with thick Irish accent.   My grandfather still tops the thickest accent out of em all, my grandmother had a slight one mixed with Scottish. So why is mine so odd?
-What's sexy?  Men: uhh... Tits?  Women: a specific accent.
Oh man you should've mentioned the luck of the Irish movie from Disney channel 🤣🤣
10:46 omg the change in his facial expression is beautiful
I had no problem understanding any of the accents except for the sheep farmer.... whaaaaaat! Thank you for translating
"I'm a vowel bender." 😂
i wouldn't call irish accent music, i'd call it unintelligible gibberish at times
m i and fifteen Rs.   It's so fucking true.
awesome video!!! :D
Why does the auto generated (English) caption work Better with the Irish than the English accent 😂
"start drinking more milk bitch" 🤣🤣
Christ almighty... Some of these make listening to my friend in Edinburgh easy. And I can almost never understand wtf she's saying.
That farmer must have Irish Gaelic as his first language
You should react to heavy Scottish accents
If it's any comfort, I'm a born and bred Cork man and I couldn't make heads or tails of the farmer who lost his sheep😂😂
can this video please go on forever?
11:32 She is not amused with your accent...
wtf has he become
Didn’t see one Dublin accent 😂
Irish people pronounce some words the same way Jamaicans do especially "three"
my family is from southern ireland and my aunt sounds exactly like those two rowers!
Bro the farmer sounds like he's speaking japanese
11:12 nah the woman is speaking docklands
Why don’t they have Irish names if they’re playing Irish people?
I know a lot of people with the American ladies fake one 😂
You don't want to hear an italian talk in english, trust me you *don't*
“HE HaD a ROCK TiED to HIs NecK” I wheezeddddddddd  2:18 🤣
Best thing about this is I'm Irish \(◕ᴗ◕)/
Even only fools and horses have a better Irish accent than that farmer's one
Anyone else notice that the ones that are particularly hard to understand hardly move their lips? Try talking without moving your lips in any language and you'll probably be just as hard to understand.
mirrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
Park Garden Feckoff ! lol sorry Father Jack moment there Sean
I could understand the accents but that’s maybe cos I’m Scottish.🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
I could under stand every word
he looks too much like my maths teacher
as a kiwi. dude. same with the sheep stories. highlight of the week.
im from ireland and the films were shit
Yo Jack, trying to watch that guy was trapped on the roof. Mad accent too.
Man you gotta do another one of these videos 🤣🤣
I’m a vowel bender🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
This really reminds me of people complaining that they can't understand dead thick northern English accents, but times 100.
Sean: Gets to NI  Also Sean: Well that's the end of the video!
gg to that lady for trying but there's SO MANY it's like England in that regard, there's 3 massively different accents in my city alone
why does Jack's accent seem american?
I haven't watched this i just know kerry is on it
The Jamaican accent is on par with Irish accent right if not I feel offended
I understood almost every word and i’m scottish 😂
Mirror.
Im part irish. Weird
I can understand most people with Irish accents just based off dialect alone, Where i live (eastern canada) we have a Irish dialect but over the years adopted the 'normal' Canadian accent, most people from out of province can barely understand a word we speak, that and its because we talk very fast.
I love how relatable we are to jack and as a cork man myself jack did do a decent job but he’s like the spokesman for the Irish only his words get out there but god are they true ❤️
Brad Pitt sounds like an Irish lad going through puberty lmao
Reminds me of how awful Christopher Walken was as Captain Hook in the live Peter Pan play on TV  a few years ago. At this point, it's just sad. People need to stop putting him in things lol
I legit thought I was glitching out because the words sound like gousbfhs abd iebabfeaifbfa fbuegiaglkrg and I'm like WHAT LOL
Listening to that farmer is what I imagine it sounds like when you have a stroke and someone talks to you.
I have some good friends from Kerry who exchanged to my school.  It took almost a year to fully understand them a decent amount of the time.
Nobody can do a better Irish accent than the Irish.
"My god, you are so lucky you're gorgeous" Jack said about Brad Pitt. My mind: *w h y a r e y o u g a e ?*
I understood what the Irish man was saying because I’m a Irish farmer and another thing Irish people sometimes say is how are the boys and then you’ll answer by saying grand out
Uhh so I am Irish and I just don’t understand how people don’t understand the accents
Jack does a helluva Christopher walken impression😂
Imagine corpse with a Kerry accent
brad pitt plays a gypsy in that movie! doesn't he??
Each video jack listens to his accent gets less and less understandable
the cork accent at the end reminded me of billy from the young offenders lmao
Wait so is Sean actually Irish
Brad Pitt and Denzel Washington did a Jamaican accent in a movie, It was so cringey to watch. lmao
Me casually watching this video. *sees 0:40 *  Me regretting being a child and drinking a glass of milk while watching this
50 seconds in and sure Jack mentions Wild Mountain Thyme!!! Well impressed he could hold out  for 50 whole seconds before the Shite Irish accents in that film came into the conversation. Fair play, because that film is shocking and desperate to say the least! Just the idea of it does my head in. 😵😩
Frostbutt KEKW
That farm is speaking too fast . what is he saying?😂😂😂😂😂
No wicklow accent of course 😭
I NEED MORE. THIS CALIFORNIAN NEEDS MORE!!!
Færm
Didn't you used to say "top of the morning to you" in your intro?
You know you don’t make sense if Jack doesn’t understand you😂
I'm drinking milk right now 🤣
6:43 All i hear is have a good dragon and fortnite
English is not my first language, yet I could understand everything 😂 Even the sheep dude.
9:00 they sound drunk lmao
13:55 I think that's one of the *least* strong of the Irish accents.
Cork accent mixed with natural husk and alcohol..it took a few hours but I eventually understood the bugger. Lovely guy, constantly talked about ‘craic’
Are you from Southern or Northern Ireland Jack? What is the native accent where you are from?
You forgot Yola! The ancient Cork language. Look it up.
the irish farmer one was actually our practise matura exam for english class.....english is not even our native language
Jack, you need some rubber bandits in your life! Fierce Limerick
After one year in Carlow i can proudly say i understand a lot but that kerry accent...understood nothing 😂
0:40 💀💀
One of my favourite YouTube channels is a stand up comedy Irish group of lads called Foil, Arms and Hog. Brilliant
I came from watching Jacksepticeye to a worm hole of Irish songs. new fav Dulaman
*urge to watch Father Ted intensifies*
I love rte
Wonder what youtube captions will come up with these
ℍ𝕖 𝕤𝕒𝕚𝕕 𝕗𝕠𝕣𝕥𝕟𝕚𝕥𝕖
Its pournounsed uo
I understand mikey Joe's accent cause were sheep farmers
Bruh I don’t understand shit
Fun fact, Brad Pitt's bad Irish accent in Snatch was intentional, it was Guy Richie's response to criticisms about unintelligible accents in his previous movie, Lock Stock and 2 Smoking Barrels
Man lost his sheep and speaks doctor's hand writing; therefore, Sean is a pharmacist.
Cries in Scottish
“what the FUCK Jeff!” killed me hahahah
Doesn't say "top of the mornin' to ya"?...... but....... what about all the videos I've watched where that's literally your opening?  "Top of the mornin' laddies" = Jacksepticeye
For the farm clip, all I heard were bag pipes
You should have just whipped up some nogla vids
Shout out to my Aussie peoples
Aw I’m from Louth he’s from a part of Louth called Drogheda probably I think
Aw here how did you not hear of “aw ya wouldn’t be long getting frostbite” until now
about the word "mirror"....in my american accent we say it like "mirr" too but only with about 5 R's
You forgot the HEALY RAE as an example of Kirry
You can tell Sean has lost touch when he doesn't recognise the last cartoon character as Rubber bandits
3 accents people do horrible ott impressions of 1. British 2. Irish 3. Scotish
I don't think I know anyone more Irish than Jack Jackie's Irish as potatoes and Guinness.
*Hey Jack can you say top of the morning to ya and 🥔*
In my opinion scottish is better mate😝😝😝😝😝😝😝
I am swedish, and me and other swedish people is in 7 place :(
As an Australian, how did I understand ALL of these without needing some sort of translation o.o
Didn’t diss Australia 💪
As an irish ppl who impersonate irish ascents are just cringe
So Mikey Joe O'Shea is the Irish equivalent of Boomhauer
Am I the only one who thinks Jack's Christopher Walken sounds like Arnold Schwarzenegger?
I need clarification... Is that.. really English languange but just in a dialect or its an entire diff languange??? Coming from non native english speaker, who is amused and intrigued.
Jacksepticeye secretary British?  Evidence: Get f**ked France
Jack u should've watched the young offenders!
"Irish accent" mate, the 2 ends of cork city have different accents, please elaborate next time
gary and paul are bae
as a fellow Irish person, this was very entertaining XD
Frostbutt
Legit needed a translation for slang and an accent.
The rowing guy sounds irish- jamaican lol
The lad after losin his sheep sounds pure Kerry
Not only does that farmer have an extremely strong accent he is also an excessive mumbler.
To be fair to brad, the traveller accent isn't the same as any other Irish variant that he is likely to have ever heard. I think he did pretty well considering how far removed he is from the small community of Irish travellers. Even many Irish struggle with traveller dialects sometimes.
I hate other people trying to sound irish, the Irish can only be irish
Mirrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
Omg am I the only one that gets reminded of How to Train Your Dragon every time I hear a Irish man because of the vikings 😂😂
Me, a half hispanic, part Irish, German, Polish, etc: *can understand most muddled spanish speakers, and most American southern accents*  Me watching this and trying to understand this: ....Que?
Haha eat shit France he said it of funny stuff in the bif
I loved this so much! It's so interesting to get to know the differences between accents. It's way easier to notice the little things with an actual Irish person pointing out all the little nuances and it makes it so much more fun. I love how every Irish person called out the Imposter lol
But did they loose Farthy Fay Shee?
Please please please please please do another video like this🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Drink feck girls
One of the MOST gorgeous Irish accents come from Cillian Murphy, I cannot get enough of that man
As someone with a newfie family i could actually understand most of the sheep farmer
U realize Pitts doing a Gypsie-Irish accent right? Travelers have WAY different accents
Russian accent is the most sexy.
"Most sexy" or "sexiest", not "most sexiest".
Look I appreciate your  position Mr. Webly, but you can't go around chopping down other peoples hedges without permission
Saw this on my suggested. I was able to translate some of what the rowers said from Jack’s older vid teaching us Irish words. I’ve never felt so accomplished
When Christopher walken said "welcome to Ireland" I expected him to say the "land of ire" after it
I betcha the Kerry girl IS from Kerry because she definitely isn't English... if she walked in and said Imma do an English accent and did that it would be much more off than the Kerry by my ear.  Bet their channel is based in England or something and maybe she's been out of Ireland long enough to pick up a bit o' English without realizing it
2:23 does anyone else feel like he sounded like an off brand Arnold Schwarzenegger
Oirish people are awesome mate, just a statement from some random Eastern European dude on the internet! :) But ye, I love Irish culture and accents, and mainly mentality. :)
"Oi don't know if Oi'm a good barometer fer dis."
Oi, I'd rather listen to a puppy being eaten alive by rats than listen to this dude talk.
Whaaaaats daaaaa stoooooorrryyy buuuuuud ya got any chaaange
12:22 You know jack, it's actually the same with german langauge. Long tought and indulged american or english students practicing german, are horribly shocked when they realize, baverian german or austrian german, is not the same thing as standard German.  For example when they start living in munich.  Standard german speakers (born in states like the Northrine) have hughe difficulties of understanding  baverian (another dialect of  german speeach) language. So when ever a foreign student travels to baveria,  sufficiently versed in the standart german language, they will find themselves lost when talking to a native baverian in german. Luckily most can understand  you and respond in  "proper" german language.  They can understand you, but you can't understand them, unless they try to talk in standart german (which still has very strong accent in that case unless they in turn are well versed in it.)  It's practically a dual lingual issue.
At 19:20 I did not even realise that seàn paused the video I thought that the guy was still talking 😂😂😂
The opening was the worst interpretation of a irish farm I have ever seen
Farty-five missing sheep, eh? Well that stinks!
The sheep farmer sound kind of like rare dialectical Norwegian.
"_sexiest accent_" My accent: ellohay owhay areay ayay
Irish and scottish accents are the exact same, change my mind
Irish accent: bEsT  German accent: FunNieST
Irish accents are wonderful.
We have Spar stores here in norway too!
With all that oil America will sure invade soon
Jacksepticeye saying herb is my sexuality
Awesome, he did hot fuzz refence🤗🤗
You guys say 'arse' and 'shight'. A lot....right?
Jack the Vowelbender needs to be a series...😅
remember kids, tSITHIGH is pronounced tihik.
Ah the Irish boomhauers
2:21 sound like terminator
This is what english sounds to non engslish speakers
Im so glad to represent my irish blood ❤
at 11:42 i started dying for no reason when he said M I and fifteen R's
not me pausing the video of the vocal coach to see if I sound like it  and if she's acurate
They were trying their best at least
I’m verry disappointed that there wasn’t any junkie Dublin accent
i had a irish co worker i got along with real well, i credit him with y i understand most of these
6:19...alright ive had it! Who is michael williams?!
So what do us Americans do when we are planning to travel to Ireland?? I want to be respectful and maybe learn some Gaelic if it still exists in common speech. The stuff I hear on tv is just confusing! Are any of these folks legit? What do I do? Are there any good resources to learn a decent Irish accent? Please help!! I would appreciate it so much. Thanks!!💜
The northern Irish accent is 🤯
The one thing that always reminds me Sean is Irish is when he says "hard" (sounds like "hurrrd")
The snatch character isn’t supposed to be specifically Irish
I’ve lived in the US 100% of my life. But a third of my DNA is Irish and I’ve always said certain words with an Irish accent. I can only assume  some primal part of my DNA comes raging out or something. It happens unconsciously but after I say one such thing, I pause for a second and ask myself, “where the hell did that come from?”
Lowkey, this reminded me of my Physics professor. He was South Ireland born with a super heavy accent for his area, but I could typically understand him because my parents were weird and had me pretty cultured with a bunch of different shows and movies when I was a kid (I'm American). We were working on a different material instead of our predesigned plans for the day. Everyone knew he played golf and he was using golf, which I also play, as an example for something maybe 5 minutes before this section. As he was lecturing, he was not writing anything on the board and kept saying "par" and my brain did not process that he was talking about because I thought he was still talking about golf. Like maybe he had carried over the discussion from earlier. We get another 20 minutes into the lecture with everyone shooting me glances to help them because he had been going off about par for too long , so I raise my hand and I just go:   "Sir, why are we still going over par? I thought we finished the golf example?" He just stares at me.... "Par? NO... Pawr."  I blink a few times. "Yeah, par like the hole has 4 par and you get the ball in the cup in 4 strokes.". "NO. PAWR." I start to chuckle, "Par?" "PAWR." "Why don't you write it down sir?" "P O W E R." "Oh, power. Got it. So do you want to relate power to golf today or should everyone trash their notes and try again?" He dropped the marker and started laughing his butt off for 5 minutes.
Should've reacted to all of the weasley family's onscreen apperances
I'm quite late to the party, but thick irish dialects kinda sounds like a carribeean accent
8.50 the only word I got out of that was real
Nobody: Minecraft enchantment table: 5:32
❤️
My Soccer coach is Irish and when he is pissed.... He's scary ..
0:40
The captions translate the hard to hear Irish better then clear English 😂🤦🏻‍♀️
HOT FUZZ
You should react to the USA Deep South accents see if you can understand them lol
my mom's family is very irish-american and from massachusetts so the irish accent is just my grandma's accent minus the boston
Jack please react to father ted
Tom Cruise’s Irish accent in Far and Away is hilarious
I like how in the beginning he didn’t say ANYTHING to the Australians 🤣
MOOOREEEE!!!
yours jack is far by the best :)
I knew Mickey from Snatch was gonna be in here!! Love that guy lol
Hmm.. So, Newfies are somewhere between Irish and Welsh? If you can understand a thick ass Newfie accent then you can understand any accent. Don't believe me? Listen to a Newfie talk.
More Irish videos. You can learn more about your country and so can we
384 days of drinking Guinness...
Jesus that kid sounds like the 80 year old farmer next to me in wales
Ah lad, first time watching...😂😂  Keep it up man, and depending on your location God bless Areland...32 tal
The best Irish accent I ever herd was Robert sheehan. His voice is gorgeous <3
Watching people trying to pronounce your accent or language is just, It’s just weird...
Scottish>Irish change my mind.
Ha ha eat shit *France*  - Jackespticeye, pre-2021
I’m Irish, Scottish, Danish, Spanish. When I was getting made.... somethin’ went wrong, I’m ReTaRdEd.
Sean: my god that's a thick accent me: no he is just straight up speaking Gaelic at that point
You sound like dr dufinsmuchs when you see I don’t care
Why am I thinking how Irish rap sound like
I am both Irish and German and I do not actually have any accent
20:49 in da woRlD 🤣
I love hearin people try to do accents from southern America cuz they always go straight for the Texan accent 😂 like ah yes my state dont exist🤪
the farmer sounds to me as a German more like he is trying to speak dutch than englisch xD
Saying that the accent from Snatch is not accurate shows that Jack never spoke to someone from Tallaght, Finglas, Ballymun (Neighborhoods in Dublin).
Me being French and having an amazing time translating for my English cousin. It’s easy for me to understand an Irish accent.
the Kerry accent is amazing. i feel like if you can master that accent you might as well get citizenship right away xD
Iam from ireland
It’s hilarious to me when people from other places try to do the American “southern” accent.  I admit, my accent is pretty cringe, but I only notice when I hear myself on video.
wait... there are Spar stores outside the Netherlands? even i haven't been to one like... ever.
Oil beef hooked!
Yer a vowel bender harry
What I've understood: "The Irish accent is an illusive thing"
Why can't anyone do a decent Irish accent? Or is that just how we sound to everyone else
Fart Five.. five sheeps farted... yeah, that sounds right.
‘I need to have a shite’  ThAtS ScOtTiSh Also I LOVE sheep that baby is the cutest little thing
they never did Wexford
Okay I really loved that last little bit of the vid it put a huge smile on my face. I really like the way Irish people sound and I loved the way the animated cartoon like character was explaining all the different accents and sounds.
Me waiting for him to say fuck you Australia as getting the emus ready for war
*farthy-faive sheep*
I liked the Irish one
End up with an Irishman in the dark thats quite "talkative " you'll end up laughing and offending them.
It's Hollywood at it's finest.  Fake everything.  I grew up in the south, USA, not England for you wankers.  I live in the north in Washington State.  We had fellow come up from Louisiana and no one but me could understand him, lol.  I had to translate because his accent was so bad and he spoke quicker than an auctioneer.  Good times.....
Try Newfie slang, it kills me XD
Go to Dalkey. You will never hear "english" like it.
I vote Jack's accent was better than any else
"Music, you call it! Music!" He said musically.
Quackity: translates spanish to english  Sean: translates farmer english into understandable english
The look of pride on his face when he said “park! garden!” 😄
So where is jack from?
At furst i foht Irish wos a defferent langwedge
Nobody:  *Jacks accent suddenly feeling inferior*  _Jack gets more Irish_
Sexy accent, perhaps. But, ya need sexy hair to match it
Its like Newfie accents.  Since Newfoundland is very much derived from the Irish language, certain parts of the province are more heavy than others.  All in all I think we have 40ish dialects all with their own distinct phrasing and illegible wordings.
I can understand like half of them specifically because I work in customer service
Oh for ppl who CANT SPELL jack’s real name Seán if u put the accent on the E that will make it Shane.     i’m not irish ☘️...
that old man talking about his sheep is what English sounds like to non-English speakers
Is it weird that I'm not even Irish and I can understand most of what they're saying? 😂
That farmer sounds like my grandfather, the extreme accents of west west is crazy sometimes
I'm not even Irish (I'm from America) and I find this funny
That farmer sounded German to me !
My subtitles went wild when the farmer was on hahahaha
9:30 90% chance they just said to each other before the interview “let’s do the harshest accent we can do“
It's called Welsh
Tom walken pretending to be Irish who sounds like British toast who is imitated bye jack  can’t hurt you Tom walken: 18:51
Wow the translation is not random shit
0:24 good choice not dissing Aussies mate
Farty five I CANT BREAAAAATHE😂😂😂😂😂😂
i am a fecking legend
Pitt doesn't just play a regular irishman his character is a gypsy so it's not supposed to sound like a regular irish accent
I'm from Kerry and my dad sounds very like that farmer when he's talking to other farmers. I  started ironically adding the "sh" sounds to S words a few years ago, and once you shtart you can't shtop
Brad Pitts accent in snatch is much closer to the Newfoundland accent
I don't get how Scottish people get so offended when someone calls them Irish like I'm Scottish and when someone calls me Irish I scream ding ding ding bell of galec brotheren
is it weird i can undersdand  this wwo w its weird i have a super power  thats cool
well  try afrikaans
Oh my god, I’m so glad. I was feeling so bad about not liking Limerick but if I knew this I could have saved myself a year of guilt 😂 I will never forget that mall in Limerick for the rest of my life! However, had the BEST pub breakfast ever in Limerick. Unforgettable for many reasons 😂 I miss the Irish!
I know what he is saying
I’m Irish and OMG my mammy and daddy say I’m Irish
I studied English for more than 10 years, and here I'm looking like a donkey hearing that 🙄
Jack watching the how to do an Irish accent video "I'm going to have to put on my double seeing glasses because I cant even begin to see the amount of BULLSH@*$t COMING FROM YOU"
bro the first 45 sec thou. drink some more milk bitch
"I'm a vowel bender."  Thanks, now I'm dead XD
there are too many different irish accents in my family lmao. We're a fabulous amalgamation
that's literally not english
And I thought south Yorkshire accents were wild
Y’all can’t tell me that farmer’s video was not in a different language
How did jack not notice blindboy from the rubberbandits at 19:54
i came into this as a minecrafty person so i heard the farmer say: I came out for a cuppa joe in the mornin an someone stole my elytra
Seán it's not your accent that makes you hard to understand, it's how fast you talk that makes you hard to understand
Sean imitating Christopher Walkin's accent sounds like the Terminator
I laughed so much, I actually lives in Kerry and some of my friends are even worse than the farmer, you would think they speak Gaelic, but like Munster Gaelic, also none 2 people have the same accent here... Therefore I find other counties people easy to understand, yeah even Cork
When I hear an Irish accent I think of a fat lady in a cottage with porridge.
my friend lives next door to the frosbit ladd
gday
I can speak Irish.      Guten tag
This is the exact reaction I have when I watch the movie Fargo!  The accent is WAY overboard.
Me: An Irish brogue? Which county town? Teacher: What? What do you mean? Me:*uses the accent of the farmer Teacher: That’s not what I meant!
Also reminds me of Brigid from AC Valhalla
I swear I have not stopped watching this video until i was able to decipher what the actual fuck irish accents people have that are super thick
Takin a trip to the field across the road to run around with my arms out later tonight if anyone wants to join xo 😂
Hahaha look the guy in the top left corner is irish ha
My gf is from the south of Ireland
Tell me someone's revealed the twist of the movie to him since...
that southern Irish accent is the reason I email my cousins in Ireland instead of calling them. IDK what the fuc yer saying buddy.
i can just barely understand sean.. i dont even know if these ppl are speaking english 😭
its like joe biden when he said hvmhavmha
Is it just me or is his accent not that thick? For me he just articulates everything more and he speaks really clearly. It doesn't sound as soft or slurred/smooth as american english or british english? But I'm austrian, so what do I know 😂
I’m Irish
Kerry accents crack me up. The one with the old man in the bar gets me.
Why do people always ask to say top of the morning to ya.. Like where did that come from.. It's so cringy when people ask me. I've never heard anyone say this lol
So... non irish people doing an irish accent is like prussians trying to speak bavarian. Gotcha.
*I thought he was gonna watch Conor McGregor*
Sean at Wild Mountain Time: ALL THESE BAD IRISH ACCENTS Jamie Dornan actually being Irish: 🥲
@19:45 I get the impression that Seán doesn't know The Rubberbandits from Limerick. That's clearly Mr. Chrome wearing the Spar bag. Pure shame.
The sheep guy got me thinking im having a stroke !
To me (as a German) irish songs more like dutch or danish then english to me.
The guy with the sheep id hate to be my doctor
I'm one of your fucking Kings and I can't get accommodation, or a job, or a woman... Direct descendant of the gilpatrick's of ossory...
huat??
As a spanish speaker, who knows little english, all I hear is "flalfalljlkja i ioara koiar lioela ioeo r ioeirua leiuro"
Sean saying why sounds like "hwoi"
Ayeee my accent is the 5th most sexiest  But ngl Irish accents are sexy af
Lady teaching Irish accent saying flower. With Jack it sounds like flyer with her is sounds like flare. ? I don't know why I find this so interesting.
That Irish boy is getting frostbutt that's what I heard
an hoaarr oar chew💀🤚
One word sums up this whole video "WHAT????"
I understood about 70 percent of what the sheep farmer said. Surprisingly okay but that's really thick jesus
Wait i thought Filipino accent is the most sexiest??😂😂
Brad Pitt sounds right and not right because he is not only irish he is also a gypsy
Is there a jersey Irish accent suddenly? 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Tyrone speaks differnt from you la were like our own wee country
Ok please look for Cornish accent
There is an imposter among us
rant ahead:                  god and i thought the scouse accent craze was bad in my school- i get what u mean when u hear a shit accent (btw i constantly get called a dirty scouser and everyone does shitty scouse accents at me so i get what u mean) its proper annoying i dont know why they bother to do it because its just annoying and its not like funny or anything.  the sad part is because i moved from liverpool to where i live now like 5 yrs ago so ive lost me accent alot so i dont get accepted by my family and old friends the same and constantly get called a wool, but in my school and all me wool matescdont accept me as one of there own.  the worse thong of it all i sthat there are clearlky other scouser kids who are left alone by the ones who make fun of me and theyre like proper proper scousers so no one actually considers me as a proper scouser or a proper wool so im kinda just considered as an outsider? ik it sounds weird that i feel like this because of an accent but imagone being a 12 year old scouser in a almost fully scouser school and like the 3 scousers have super strong accents and live in liverpool-  okay sorry for the rant its just that im being fully singled out in school and its just hurting my feelings-
I can speak a whole bunch of languages, but what an actual fuck
12:30 I’m pretty sure you can classify American accents into just two accents  Northern  Southern/Country
Also im loving this
that farmer.. it feelt like i was suppose to understand him (scandinavian here) he sounded very similar to strong scandinavian accents but i could noot understand (exept some things ofcourse)
The comparison between you and the “Irish farmer” it massive jack being the better one
They didn't cast irish people because they're always too drunk to acr
IS HE JUST GONNA IGNORE THAT JAMIE DORNAN IS IN THE MOVIE!?
I would love to hear you do a video on a Newfie accent. It comes from many of their descendants coming from Ireland.
The only one that I could really understand was the Olympians. The others I was laughing like a madwoman and my puppy was checking on me to see if I was okay. Especially for the farmer who was missing sheep.
I watch about an hour of Irish accent videos to understand jacks videos
"skeedin Heetin Horten"
The farmer's accent was completely undiscernible to me. Every now and then I could hear the word "Sheep" or "Lost" but that was it.
This is the prettiest mane alive. And the funniest, at times.
I am from cork but don't have a cork accent like not really a cork accent
I’m scotch Irish and im am born in the us and I want to learn to use a Irish accent
Jack I'm from Ireland and I live in Meath,Navan  If you have heard of Navan
What the fuck Jeff
11:45 Vocal coach: "Flaa-wirr, Saaah-wirr  Aaah-wirr." Jacksepiceye: " Are you going to say 'flewre?' And 'Sewre?'  Vocal coach: " *Flywre* "  Btw: That vocal coach is Madeleine Harvey, one of the best in the world
I just think of Niall Horan bc hes Irish, sorry I’m a directioner.
"Park, Garden ... I'm great at this" - Jack says as he already has a Irish accent learning the Irish accent  11:31
10:46 bullshit
The fact that he could actually understand the farmers makes me so happy for some reason😂😵😆
I love em all xD They‘re so funny to listen to
5:36 i heard “bright out” then gave up
There's no bad Irish accent, only a good one.
okay yet us from wiltshire can because do good irish accents because they're kind of similar
I need to know every Irish accent now
7:57 - 8:33 I wasn't really expecting to see a Northern Irish accent make an appearance, but at the same time I'm not really that surprised! I could only just understand him, and I'm even from Northern Ireland. Thankfully my accent is nowhere near as strong!!
No Northern Irish Accents..... damb.
It’s so mesmerizing seeing Sean translate a very thick accent
I'm actually partially Irish so statistically I should have a better chance at doing a decent accent?
Not gunna mention Sweden in 7th
The farmer could only get more unintelligible if he was from Limerick
Think I just found my fav video ever this is amazing
“Eat shit France!” Spy will remember that.
I'm Canadian and yet I understood most of what the sheep farmer was saying. I did struggle tho lol
My auditory processing disorder is taking a beating
i was legit suprised seeing sweden on that list XD
"Start drinking more milk bitch" me who has a very low calcium and can barely walk-  yeah that's what I'm supposed to do- and as a tip from me don't drink 6 cups of soda everyday PLEASE-
What bout Newfoundland bhy
Me: that sounds like it’s German  Sean: I’ll translate  Me: (thinks he’s joking) Sean: starts translating  Me: 😱    Edit : thx for 69 likes
I have a friend that is Irish and lives in ireland and I’m surprised that I can understand what she is saying but except when it comes down to saying certain letters it’s hard to understand 😂
The sheep farmer just reminds me of north welsh
They sound the same lol sorta
What about norway-i feel targeted
his excruciating pain listening to the woman doing the accent is felt when listening to people try do the scottish accent ;-;
19.30 is accurate 🤣
Bai I'm Irish and I couldn't get a word of it  🤣 yuuup Cork is the best
11:32 When he says garden so happy is just makes me feel good
This is like When I went to London for the First Time. English is my second language but I was very proud of my Level, not perfect but I understood everything without subtitles for years until I arrived at London. First person I talk asking for directions and I couldnt understand a single word they were saying, I started panicking like : wtf where did my English go!? Help!!!!! Someone.   I nearly cried When I understood someone in the tube. This vídeo of the old man talking about the sheeps... Good.. Its like a flashback, the panicking of "what is he saying!? "
I'm a vowel bender 😂😭😂😭😂😭😂😭😂
Jack I can’t believe you didn’t react to “strongest Irish accent you’ll ever hear”. That shit had me howling, it’s so good. Please give it a watch
Brad Pitt wasn’t speaking Irish, as the movie says “it’s not English, it’s not Irish, it’s pikey”
Wild Mountain Thyme is the name of an actual Irish folk song! otherwise known as Will Ye Go Lassie. Listening to the trailer of the movie the same melody played during it.
I’m fucking dying 😂😂😂
7:32 No, it's not forty-five sheep, Jack, it's farty-faive sheep.😉
Farty Five
My cousin is Irish and he hates the accent
15:24 "there was forty five sheep missing" NOOOO you definitely said FARTY FIVE.
8:50 their mouths barely opened or moved !
God i confuse Scottish and Irish so much even though i know the vocal differences between each one ugh. I love both accents tho💕
Sean says he’s good at the Irish accent SORRY BUT YOU ARE
Mirror iwith 15 r's, that made me laugh hard
Fun little fact , I have some Irish blood in me and I’m Mexican but I’m thinking of going to Ireland and those places to know a little more of the history of my other blood cuz why not 😂 🤷‍♀️
I have genetic ties to the Celts (my dads side) and Anglo-Saxon (my moms side). I find it amazing and interesting to listen to all the different accents from both sides. My favorites so far are: Irish, Scottish, and Welsh
Why does the guy at 8:07 sound like he's mixed with southern/Canadian Newfoundland?
He is so young with grey hairs
Mickey (Snatch):  It’s stated when the Gypsies are introduced that their accents “aren’t Irish, and they aren’t English either”, so I’d say Brad Pitt did okay with that ._.
bro i know your pain with accents except im scottish
In Ireland the accent changes every 10 km
*puts conor mcgregor on the video*
Vowel bender!!!! 😆😆😆😆😆
I'm loving the grays growing in 😍
Nah, we can understand ya quite easily, Sean!
I’m from cork
PUT SOME PERM ON DAT ATTITUDE
The guy in the sheep video sound just like me when i'm drunk.
My nan is Irish through and through and cannot understand a word that farmer was saying 😂😂😂
The way they're talking you'd think they were actually speaking Irish.
Damn Sean you really did Italy dirty
2:21 u Sounded Like Gru From The Minions-
Wait-  That farmer was speaking English?  Also fun fact: I'm Appalachian and many people say that our accents are still somewhat similar to Irish and Scottish accents due to our heavy Scots-Irish heritage. However, I don't understand about half of what they're saying.
Those accents makes me think of Jacks accent so differently
Hahaha  I guess its sexy if you like the sound of alcoholism  Anyways, you want funny, Robert Pattinson doing a southern accent is HILARIOUS.
Jack reacts to Brad Pitt in the Devils Own
That whole video with the man losing his sheep has me laughing and saying “what?” The whole time 😂
Even with translating for the farmer, I still didn't believe that's what he said, lol. 😂
they're speaking the doctors handwriting
Frost butt
County Cork girl sounds like Rayla from the dragon prince
Wild Mountain Thyme said we have zero dialect coaches, or really much cultural research at all
Yo, my Voice II (studying dialect) class literally spent the entire second half of the semester shitting on Wild Mountain Thyme and the terrible accents.
Sean Mac An tSithigh  Jack Sep tIceye
Yo...I wanna drink with you and see how much jibberish comes out of our faces and the confusion between the two of us...
I’m ashamed I can’t understand the language of my ancestors
I was born and bred in Kerry that’s an absolute tan accent off your wan
i genuinely could not understand a single fucking word of the sheep guy like what the fuck was that
I haven’t stopped laughing yet 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Can Jack speak Gaelic?
Sean is the Irish Shrek 🤣
LOL Omg i love this! Also, part of me wishes this was the extent of the news broadcasted in my country.
the most underrated bad irish accent is justin theroux in charlie's angels: full throttle. the way he says pain haunts my dreams
at least the horse nayed in Irish ;)
Missing that Rubberbandits are from Limerick, for shame
Irish is to English as Andalusian is to Spanish
I honestly miss the "Top of the mornin" intros XD
0:27 HAHA! .. he said Frenz/Frends/Frens..
im northern irish and people still don't understand what im saying 👨‍🍼👨‍🍼👨‍🍼🤺🤺
6:46 is he speaking gaelic?
I fuckin have a sexy accent. UP MAYO FER SAM
I didn't think Brad Pitt was Irish. I thought he was speaking some special Gypsy slang. Like how America's deep southern accent is so different from the rest of the country.
I thought he said farty five o.o
To be fair to Brad Pitt, Turkish specifically describes Mickey's accent as NOT Irish
A Kerry accent is to Irland as a Newfie accent is to Canada lol
I've got my Siri accent set to Irish lmao
I feel like Jack was my TARDIS during this video. The more I listened to him, the easier it was to understand all the other thick accents!
Jack’s “christopher watkins” impression sounds like arnold schwarzenegger.
Honestly your accent isn't that thick lol Yours is actually pretty easy to understand.
8:20 sounds like german then japanese
*FROSTBUTT*
No one: Irish people: FARTy-five 5:25
that how to do an irish accent is so cringey
5:35 thats not an accent that a whole new fucking langaue xddd
You should show them some some Sminky shorts clips.
IRISH PEOPLE... THE MOST BEAUTIFUL AMD HANDSOME PEOPLE IN THIS WORLD LIVES THEIR. SO FAR ANY IRISH ACTOR OR CELEB I HAVE SEEN ALL LITERALLY ALL HAVE BLUE EYES AND BEAUTIFUL DIRTY BLONDE HAIR OR RED HAIR. SEAN HAS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL BLUE EYES. I HAVE BEEN IN LOVE LIKE FOR 5 YEARS MAYBE WITH NIALL HORAN. I FREAKING LOVE JAMIE DORNAN, JONATHAN RHYS MEYERS AND MANY MORE FROM IRELAND.
Sean said the hot fuzz thing before I could type it into the comments! :(
I thought that emily blunt and christopher walkin had a good irish accent, but ig not, because I'm not irish
The Irish farmer is just the Irish Ozzy Osbourne looool
Surprising that jack didnt recognize mr chrome . Thats limerick city
I love snatch-
Hahaha I used to talk to a girl from limerick and the stories were so unique and fucky lmao.
" eat shet france " said Jack
Also sèan what college did you go to, my dad was a sound engineer as well as lighting in the L.I.T
Eh they got it all fuckin wrong it’s areland I’m from Ireland I speak different but areland
The thick accents sounded like a different language
hsaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahasaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
As a Scot I have almost no problems with the Irish accents 🤔 except that sheep farmer sometimes
I need subtitles.... God I didn't get any of that
A County Down accent is completely different
Jack/Sean I hope you read this even though the video is a few weeks old but could you also react to Cian Berry doing the voice of Zane in Borderlands 3? Curious if you think his Irish accent is on par or not?
honestly im not surprised with the movie's character names and actors lmao just look at how they butchered many asian related movies
Wow offending the South imma stay in stáb city then
I thought I couldnt understand the farmer because he was missing teeth, but now I know it is just an Irish accent.
when the irish farmer started speaking my brain stopped working
Christopher Walken doing any accent is pure comedy gold. See the NBC live Peter Pan with him as Captain Hook.
6:04 can’t stop thinking of the scene from hot fuzz with the mumbling guy
I can do a: Ok British accent Ok Scottish accent Meh Irish accent Good Australian accent Goodish Boston accent Meh German and Russian accents
Mike Myers can do one
Don'tsh cheenge for anybotay!
The joke´s on you Séan, im not subscribed at all!
i could understand the farmer because i live here in ireland
What I learned is Irish accents are like Finnish accents, you can pinpoint where people are from with a 15km radius based solely on how they speak
I  love watching jacksepticeyes videos
Dang he has grey hair now getting older
Anybody else have a stroke when he starts translating the farmer that had his sheep stolen?
I think Australian is best 👌
To whomever added the subtitles to the Brad Pitt part of the video, I thank you wholeheartedly 🙏🙏🙏
Omg the sheep guy and Brad Pitt sounded like they were talking a different language!! I’m awful at identifying accents but I can normally understand them, but that straight sounded like a different language. (I’m also baked so that also may be why)
i feel like she was trying to teach the stereotypical irish accent lol
Can you please talk about the new copyright law that could potentially be a big problem for youtubers and twitch streamers!
2:32 that's scottish it sounds like groundskeeper willie
Tings lol
This video made me miss travel even more :'(
They sound like they're speaking currsive
He suspiciously stopped at Ulster... hmmm.............
i think every irish person falls down this hole every now and then lmao
I'm Irish to so the farmer was easy to understand
Also fun fact did you know irish people used to be mostly as another race, so you'd have the colours people, the white people and then the irish people back in history 🤔
Honestly in limerick for some reason we have another different type of accents we got like mix of everyone here, and to this point it's just normal 🤣🤣🤣 irish people are really just an odd ball in the bunch 🤣
15:49 I lowkey thought that was my irish teacher since she looks like that and is from Cork too
You should react to that Irish Whiskey commercial because it’s just... weird
Not even the Irish understand people from Kerry.
How the farmer sounds to me: sherdgvsjatgkeugbwohSHEEPbdgejsjbnrrrehj  Seán: yes, I agree, and he CLEARLY said...  Me: OwO
I’m obsessed with these types of videos! And no they don’t get old. I pick up accents from people like a sponge so I’m dying to spend time in Ireland and come home sounding like a new person LOL
LOL
that kerry accent  was from oldham england
Really thick Irish accents REALLY remind me of thick Newfie accents. Lots of similarities.
Why does the Kerry wan sound english??
0:23 you just know they’re gonna take this out of context and try to cancel him again 😭
I would love to see you try to parse the baymens accent in Newfoundland.
They sound like they're Irish but don't want to sound like they're retarded so they have worked on speaking clearly.....  Also, I'm Irish. This dude just acting like this for clout. Gtfo
One of the actors, Jamie Dornan, is actually irish
I want more this kind of videos xD it is fun to watcchhhh
8:10 sounds like a record played backward
Irish is it's own language 😂
everyone in the comments: “🤷‍♀️sounds irish to me”  jack: “what the bloody ell is this. you call that irish”
You know the fourth dimension has been entered when we need an English speaker to translate the English language to other English speakers
Flair... Flair
The Bigfoot of the spoken word. Understatement of the century.
hagrid is irish and we stan hagrid :) ☘️
New challenge: move to the place with the heaviest Irish accent and try to live without understanding them.
I want to see an entire video where jack tries to make an English accent, if he says anything with an Irish accent, he loses.
At first watching the Irish Lads was a tad hard, but it’s not too hard to catch onto
this is NOT the right video to watch when you haven't watched sean's videos in a while- i can't understand annnnyyyythiiiing
As an Irish person, if you ever come here, DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT, go to Downpatrick
I was convinced at some points that it was no longer English wow
Nice Christopher Walken
Omg katie magrath has an Irish accent i fucking love it
it's mad that there's no eng sub for the farmer one
I'm a cyclist, and try listen to Sean Kelly a retired pro racer is sooo hard!
Sean you really do say oi when you say your i words.
I swear to god if boondocks saints doesn’t make this video
Stab city how i miss you 🤣
women with an irish accent <3
i love Irish people
this is the best jack video ive seen in a while
6:10:00 in when Jack started translating I fucking lost it
When Jack compared the accent to the scene in Hot Fuzz I was thinking that  Also the guy who’s shirtless and has a spar bag over his head at 20:00 is a reference to a group called the rubber bandits
South Irish and swamp person from the states same breed right there
Callmekevin already covered this Sean! 😌
How does he understand wtf he is saying my brain isn’t like... happening
This made me laugh so hard I loved every second
Some stereotypical Irish is like Mix between English Geordie and Australian
Yo is Sean bisexual or something? I ain't judging him if he is, but I _highly_ doubt he's entirely straight after this video
Is it bad that I can understand every single word that the sheep farmer fella said
That was fucking fun to watch. Haha
Jack: I am great at this..!!? Umm u are Irish right??
he saw the frostbit video!!!!
I always wondered why instead of white he says huait... now i know
I’m glad I have a pretty trained ear for this stuff😂 thank you to video games at a young age that exposed me to peoples accents around the world (also to my scottish best friend when I was younger). I adore Irish accents, I can understand most (other than the dude talking about his sheep lol). Honestly wanna say I had a harder time understanding scottish accents (after 3 years after being at my scottish friends house daily I NEVER could understand his father. Now 8 years later STILL can’t understand his father😂). I’m American btw, from the south (NC in specific).
It's Irish, but more Irish
I'm from like the north of Northern Ireland and I was with my cousin in Fermanagh, she's a vet that also goes across the border to deal with farms there. The farmer I met there, his entire sentence just blended into one word, he was so fast. I just managed to pick out word and guess the questions he asked me
Pretty sure this is the only irish person who doesnt hate the brits
My main language is spanish and I'm bilingual (english).  On the LOL irish accent participants, I couldn't understand well the "kerry" woman, who apparently was English hahaha.  I feel bad now. D:
Mirrrrrrrrrrrrrrr, you know, the thing that shows ya your reflection.
That's a mad load of sheep
Us Irish are fucked
Omg
I'm part irish, my ancestors came from ireland to canada and i speak soooo damn fast, same with typing
Turn on captions and you'll see what AI interpreted our fine Irish friends accent as.
I could watch this for another hour:,)
I love that the Caribbean is a buttload of European accents mixed together, how the news reporter sounds is how almost every person from St. Vincent sounds
Why did you end when accent video was about to do the north of Ireland accents :((
all i wanted from this video was to see jack react to brad pitt’s accent in snatch and hallelujah he did not disappoint xD   except he didn’t watch the d’ya like dags scene :’)
Apparently biden is 3/4 irish
What ever happend to the top of the mornin intro?
i like turtles bark
Mmmmm pls don’t like this comment Shawn
Holy Mr. Hankey! Jack has a pretty good Walken impression.
farty five sheep
My background isa mix of a lot of things, so sometimes I get random accents. Some people get surprised when I accidentally get the accent, I got to explain to em that I get them and also when I get them I type like em too😂
watching this as an American, with my Australian husband talking to me is seriously fucking with my head lol
10:12 "music you call it?" well it is quite entertaining. haha.
Suddenly I was walking around Markets Drayton during a 1Royal Irish Rangers parade...only thing missing was the Fijian ascent, I'd have been back home! 😂😂😂
"Oilrund"
They are speaking thd language of GODS !
The last video had me weezin'
I could understand the rowers
It was 30 sheep? I thought it was 40 cause it sounded like he said farty.
*"No. Thyme as in the herb"*
The farmer:jhtddfhmhfmthgmdcmghhmgcdfgjdrngfhcmhgfmrjdgegrwewfqiopjguffdggggtdeshgvmjhkv Jack:translates Me:how?!
You should do Scottish ones next
The farmer one looked a bit more Welsh than Irish
It makes no since that your trying all the time to be Irish when your not...
in from dublin snd that one with the farm i csnt fucking understand a word
If ur from Ireland in the country like myself you'll understand but like even people form the city might find it hard to understand this nevermind Foreign people
You sound more like Christopher Walken than he sounded Irish!
Brad Pitt was playing an Irish Traveler. Tbh I think he did a really good job. (Native Irish btw)
A
I understand the language
Irish sounds the way liquid gallium moves
The Rowers were quite easy to understand tho :D
Wtf !which language were they speaking.
That website is a liar!  Everyone knows Afrikaans is the sexiest accent!!!
Wait do people really pronounce mirror like mirror cuz i say mirrrr too and im American 😂😂😂😂😂
Kerry, Limerick and Cork are my fave Irish accents. Btw, the Limerick guy was from the Rubber Bandits. :)
it all just sounds scottish
To be fair, 45 sheep is a lot to be missing.
WAAAAAAAY way back in 2002. I volunteered at a Girl Scout event in County Cork. The girl scouts had different stations with challenges that were spread out all over the place and they had to come find the stations by hiking about the area. The station I was running was set up along the roadside next to a beautiful farm. The guy in the "Mad Accent" video reminded me of the farmer (and family) I met there. Lovely farmer and his family, though as the farmer was talking to me (and I can follow accents pretty well for a Canadian - one of the Girl Scout leaders warned me the family's accent was very strong and she was struggling with it even though she was from Cork as well) and anyway the farmer came out of his home eventually and came to chat and check in on me, I just nodded and smiled and tried to make conversation as best as I could with the guy. Next thing I know (because I just kinda agreed with everything that he was talking about) I was herding his cattle with him to get them down the road and across to another field..... **sigh** My friends from Galway were much easier to understand! :D :D :D
I feel like people with thick Irish accents, do not speak English as a first language, but, Irish/ (Gelige?)
Why skip northern Ireland okay I get it some identify as British and some irish but still why jack why notice northern Ireland
I'm from northern Ireland and I cant do an irish accent 😂
Jack needa react to some old south Memphis accents
Billie Irish has joined the chat
im scottish and suprised how much i understood
S E A M O I N
You can't change Christopher Walken's speech pattern! I love him.
How to speak Irish: Say the following fast- Whale Oil Beef  Hooked
you forgot about the north 💔
I like your laugh. 7:44 No, it does not.  I could understand you, but not them.
I need more of these videos 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Frost butt sounds very painful
someone tell him ballyhanaus is in mayo
I can understand some of the irish  because i have family in cork shannon and limerick and dublin
Jacksepticeye= I’m great at this  Me=No fucking shet
Come on man, Jack must play or at least react to Sean of Red Dead Redemption 2.
Ngl I think England should be n.2
In the second video it sounded like a  newfie. Also heavy Irish is like Angry newfie
can't beat the donegal accent
I haven’t watched this guy in years but I’m back because I want an Irish accent lol
We're the bousey of the breed
Rate the accents in Normal People?
I'm Irish and I don't have an Irish accent It makes me sad ;(
Just gonna be that guy. Brad Pitt in Snatch, he wasn't doing an Irish accent. In the movie - "He's not Irish, he's not english...he's piken" Its a suppppper mix of everything together as they say. Gypsies. (Sorry huge fan of the movie KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK!)
Hack the matrix with this cheat code;              Hare Krishna Hare Krishna             Krishna Krishna Hare Hare               Hare Rāma Hare Rāma               Rāma Rāma Hare Hare💙
it's the same in West Virginia, some people have accents so thicccck, that you can make heads or tail of it!
i know your from athlone so have you been to banaher
I thought they were speaking Polish or something lol
Jack should try doing a northern irish accent
Yoyr man that lost his sheep had terrible grammar and I knew what he was saying but the problem wasn't his accent it was his fuckin grammar
Im not irish but i understodd everything the olympic rowers were saying because my geography teacher was from Cork
Go back to bed as I wake up to his yelling like lol you’re yelling woke me up in the first place went from Sam and Colby to watching you lmao
Kerry is the best.
Man bun :(
I’m from cork🥺😂
Our old neighbour back in donegal was named o’ Driscoll, couldn’t stand him neither.
I love the Try Channel.  So frigin funny.
If the irish accent is the doctors handwriting, the scottish is the chemists handwriting
Guy:"Speaks the language of the enchantment table"  Me:"No one can understand that"  Jack:"Translates"  My:"THE F**K!!"
Hi
10:05 for a second I thought she's gonna say "... my name is Kevin!"
MY GUY I HAVE THE SAME EXACT PAIR OF HEADPHONES
Séan: get fucked Italy! Me: * just being an italian * 👁️💧👄💧👁️
bruhhh
Nogla has the the best Irish accent
Listening to people try and do and Irish accent will never not make me cringe
Jack has to do more videos like this it is hilarious and I guess since he is Irish he could translate that guy but even he said that even Irish people have time understanding it
Hey man, thumbs up  for you being you.
if ireland is just horses swinging your arms around falling in boats Fucking Horse well then Sign me out imma go to scotland  oh wait they're the same imma go to alabama  Oh wait they're the same  imma go to australia   Oh wait they're the same
irish = scotish  both sound the same
the irish accent is also the shitest accent
at 5:40 the dog even looks like "Say Whatt?" like it's even confused about what he's a sayin'
The Farty Five have gone missing!?
Am I on callmekevin's channel?
iM a VoCaLbEnDer      😂⬇
“ Music, you call it? _Music..-_ “
the reviews to this movie have been hilarious. i kinda wanna watch this trash.
Yes 🙌
I DIED ON “GO DRINK SOME MILK BITCH”
Why does that sheep dude sound like the chef on the Muppets????😂😂😂😂
Okay, I'm sorry but I had to think for 10 seconds to realize it was Forty Five, not Farty Five in which makes no sense (I have no accent in particular because it sometimes changes)
The thing that annoys me when it comes to accents and people is that some would claim that someone else; whose from the same country just on the opposite side of it, doesn't have a "true (insert country) accent"  if they didn't know that other person was from the same country. That's how exclusive people can be when it comes to others imitating accents, like for fuck sake appreciate that they are trying!
when i first began learning english as a mexican kid it took me YEARS to understand there were other accents depending the country and the person and that there's no right way to speak _however_ the first time 9 year old me heard jacksepticeye and like, david tennat speak i almost cried because i couldn't understand shit lol
Fartyfive Farty five really jack really jack
I didn't know Ireland had a language until I googled it after this video..
hhhhhhhherb
AMEN...  IRISH FOLK, DON'T CHANGE FOR ANYBODY...  no one should change for anybody.  We should choose to change for our own self, our own betterment...  Thank you Jack.  I appreciate you.  Thank you for this vid.  I am now subscribed.
I haven't even reached the end and I can't stop laughing...  My dog even came to see what the kerfuffle was about.  hahahaha....  I may be 1 16/the Irish in my heritage, but what the fuck ever.  I love you and everything I have witnessed.  I hope that when I come to visit Ireland, I won't face the same bullshit racism that my own fucking country has been backing since the 2020 elections.
I’m convinced that man wasn’t speaking English at all...
No sir...  YOu don't sound like that.  You are delightful to listen to. hehehehe...  I did, however, get a great giggle out of listening to the clips you posted.  I was able to follow some, but fuck all for the first one.  XDXDXD
Hi.  I got to know you a little through Markaplier, but that isn't so surprising, seeing as how weirdly influential he is.  My Non Binary offspring is the one who introduced me to Markaplier, and through him I got to learn who you were.  so here I am.  :) I have a touch of Irish in me myself, but not really enough to make much of a difference to anyone but myself. I just wanted to you know that I like you.  Not creepy stalker like, but married, never gonna have the money to be a stalker, Like.  XD So I am just learning your content outside of your interactions with Markaplier, and am entertained so far.
Is it just me or is every accent after sheep Seán so much easier to understand
18:16 He gave the instructional video lady shit for the "oil" I but the dude here says the I in Ireland just like that haha
The mad Irish accent about the sheep I could somewhat understand
12:08 Lmfao it wasn't an "our" word but he pronounced "hard" in the exact way the lady was talking about haha idk why it made me laugh so heurd loool
When he was talking about 45 sheep I stg he switched to French
Am I the only one who thinks Ireland looks like a bear
My favourite accent was the jacksepticeye accent
1:16 i dont think i have ever heard jack sound more irish then here
The farmer talks like crazy dave
I love the Irish accent so much 😍
new video title: Jacksepticeye homesick
good english on the title
the guy who lost his sheep genuinely sounded like he was speaking a different language
I feel like the most clear accent from Ireland is the Northern Irish accept but up here is just full of pure headers
9:15 sounds kinda jamaican🤣
Im a vowel bender
I’m Irish but everyone says I sound American, so sometimes out of nowhere, I’d say “yeehaw” in my best Irish accent to sound like I’m speaking an illegal language
You don't sound that bad Jack. Its all fun and good crack. In America crack is drugs. So don't say your having crack or all fun and crack people will think your doing things that are illegal. To me Irish accents are the cutest accents among British Scottish and Australian accents. But I love them.
As an irish man im triggered
Ah, an Irish Video. Finally a time to flex the heritage of Adam James O’Heifernan IV. Originated from Belfast, Holidays in Dingle! Love me some Fungie, the 20 year old undying dolphin!
Wild mountain thyme is being filmed near where I live
*GEEEEESUZ*
You may have the best accent but Scotland comedy is better YASSSS
I’m cringing so hard right now none of these know what a real Irish accent is😂☘️☘️☘️
Me: Im british and ive always loved to try to do an irish accent.. ive now realised how terrible about it.
Jack: irish accent Farmer: i lreally sslosve yoy ssjzkaop sjabvwvxkz koenoe cowl swlakind
It's just M, I and 15 r's 😂😂😂
i have noticed how cute it is when jack's accent is way thicker when he plays with his fellow lads as opposed to the american boys lol
"I don't sound like that, and if I do, I'm so sorry!" 😂😂😂
well, to be fair, brad pitt in snatch wasnt supposed to ahve an irish accent, but a gypsey one
As someone who grew up in rural Appalachia, trust me, I can sympathize
You tell me to drink milk but joke on you I CANT maybe that’s jokes on me...
I spent years in denial that there was a Wisconsin Accent... until Metalocalypse that had Brendon Small doing the voice of Pickles the Drummer who was from Wisconsin... and I realised he sounded EXACTLY like a bunch of the people that I used to know from Wisconsin and essentially like VideoGameDunkey.  Everything just became crystal clear.
Is he trying to summon a demon
It's been so long since I last watched Jack. It's good to be back once in a while. Make more videos on topics besides gaming plz.
Jack at the beginning of the channel you did sound like that way back in happy wheals 1
Bro I could not understand the guy in the second video like tf are you sayin 👁👄👁
Does jack say thick like tick
I thought this video was a funniest home video
''Eat shit France!'' Nice one
"No luck for you Scotland"  Me: I mean, thanks mate-
jack: makes fun of the vocal coach also jack: why am i making fun of this its a HeEaRrd thing to do, this is hEaERd
Why can I understand most of these accents lmfao!!! Ive never lived a day in Ireland
Are we sure they're not just drunk? I've heard quite a few drunk folk who sound like that!
My family are all from cork and speak Gaelic or with a strong accent , my mates and younger siblings don’t understand 😂 my fav cousin is called blahned and sometimes it’s kinda hard 😂
Haha "Will you say 'top of the mornin' to ya?'" "No."
Brad pit is playing a gypsy, not straight irish
Up her in the north (us)we say orl sometimes
i can't understand half of the video ... and im in peace with it .
Afrikaans is 2nd. So I have a sexy accent.
I’m Irish ☘️
Being Cornish i find im having to say things twice to other's that arn't from Cornwall.
2:18 - 2:30 is a masterpiece
Funny how the subtitles disappear when the heavy irish language starts. At this desperate time the subs are in high demand to decipher the jibby jabber as I can't understand a bloody word lol.
And I thought the people in Limmys show were a bit of a challenge
My the only one that has like this little tick that they hook onto accent they hear and then for like a week they can't stop saying stuff like the other person.
im irish and i couldnt fucking understand that lad from west kerry
Omg. The farmer one-- I couldn't understand it! But it reminded me so much of a scottish accent that was really hard to understand too :'D And I am scottish! You should react to scottish accents! I just want to see what you think XD
That Walken impression though! 😂😂😂
love it ^^
Jack : County Cork. Cork has a very strong accent. Kevin : wait a minute-
I’m surprised how much I could understand. I’m Scottish 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
Don't worry Jack, you're actually understandable even to those who struggle WHY DOES THAT SCHOOLBOY SOUND LIKE A 59 YEAR OLS
Why does that third guy sound more like Sweedish Cheff?
loved it
I think this is one accent I’ll never attempt to learn, because no matter what accent I pick from Ireland I’ll still be made fun of
Chinese, african, russian, spanish, it doesnt matter, my mom always sounds jamaican when she does any accent (shes american)
Its the same with swedish, a lot of accents. Then add that some accents in Norway sound like swedish and some swedish sounds norweigan along the border and you realize that its hard to even say what is norweigan and what is swedish.
Farty five
Why down he have to be so FUCKIN funny lol 😂
That lady is misrepresenting Irish people as if they all have the same accent. Jack said so himself that to have the accent she's doing, you'd have to be from a specific place in Ireland. I'm not trying to gate keep more so than I am trying to keep history accurate. I don't want my children in the future to look back at videos like this woman made and assume they're legitimately all the same and not separate people with separate lives, feelings, thoughts and life experience. They aren't cattle after all
2:20 thats jack Schwarzenegger
Right underneath the ad for Jack’s coffee I an ad for other coffee brands lol
The only reason I stated watching you was cuz you was the only person that I heard with an Irish accent and I loved the way you sounded so much that I just keep watching you and now I just love your content😅
You should dub over Christopher Walken's lines in Wild Mountain Thyme
Thoroughly enjoyable
"Limerick has the nickname stab city" Me an American: "Ah so Detroit"
My favourite Irish accent was definitely Jacksepticeye, followed closely by the farmer who lost 45 sheep.
I heard " froshbutt "  uh-
these people sound more like they have a mental disability.
Qark
Sean: [is Irish] Also Sean: [watching a video explaining how to do an Irish accent] "Park! Garden! I say those that way anyway, already. I'm fucking- I'm great at this!"  "You either love or you hate an Irish accent, and if you hate it, you're wrong"
mmm yes irish accents definitely gets the blood uh flowen
15:50 Like a... clover? *badun-tsh!*
id like to just say that brad pitt plays a gypsy/traveller not just an irish man
11:05 Oil Land? Don't let "the states" know...
Recently moved to Dublin from the US and I work with a few people from Donegal. Half the time they sound like they're talking underwater!
As someone who is partially deaf and Canadian, I can say that I understood about 12% of this.
my accent is often mistaken as irish. guess what i am
Come back to athlone we miss you 😂
Bruh u think Irish is bad  Hear a THICK geordie accent
I wonder what you'd think of the Newfoundland accent. 😅 It's so easy for us Canadians to tell when someone is from there. To me they sound almost Irish, but not Irish. I guess Newfoundland is the Kerry of Canada; I can usually understand it, but lots of people can't.
You do a better "American Christopher Walken" impression than Christopher Walken's Irish impression lol
Me trying this would be extremely hard bc I’m a Scott not an Irish person lmao 😂
"Oiluhnd?! No, it's pronounced Oiluhnd!" lol, love Jack. I do the same thing though. In Texas we have a pin/pen merger where we pronounce both words the same. There's a super subtle difference, but essentially say the words the same way.
An Irish accent isn’t right without throwing in a curse word every two sentences.
Ya know frostbite boy he went to my cousin school and on the last day turned up on a white horse and threw carrots at the teachers he has released music just search frostbit boy
My Irish accent is like the same as seans
I assume brad pitt is playing a gypsy or Irish traveler
5:00 Me, as a mix of scottish, german and english picked up a few grains of the words. Every time I hear an irish accent I honestly think it is close to speaking an indian accent with a weird harsh mix sometimes in it.
I heard that Brad Pitt simply couldn't pull off a convincing British or Irish accent, so he and Guy Ritchie worked on a unique accent for him to use in the movie. So it isn't as much him doing a bad Irish accent as much as it is him doing an accent tailored specifically to his part in the movie.
Love this. More Irish content. Love the Irish accent 😍
9:30 why that man look like Terroriser
This video is amazing
11:15 “I’m a vowel bender” had me DYING
Sean Mac & Cheese is my favorite News reporter.
i'm a the only swedish here????????
I can understand the cork lads
I love the sheep farmer's accent, even though I could barely understand what he said  Edit: So, I was born in Texas, but I only lived there for maybe a few months. Then I moved to Utah and then Idaho. The only time I'd have a southern accent is if I'm super angry or annoyed about something. However, the only thing about my Idaho accent is that I don't pronounce the letter "T" if it's in words like "mountain" or "fountain"
Is it just me or whenever you watch or hear something with an accent ya start unconsiously doing it aswell ? And i if you listen u can also hear Seáns accent getting heavier
I watched Hot Fuzz the other day and you translating genuinely made me think of that XD
I from ireland and speak differently from my neighbour
Clip of the "frostbit" boy, 8:00, is big ruari mcsorley, went to school with him in derry, as we'd say here, he wus sum bai hi
the sheep guy almost sounded like Irish crazy dave
I need potato im hungry
My family are from Ireland but around 100 or so years ago we had to move to America because my great great grandfather invested $10k poorly.
This man said "I'm a Vowel bender" hahaha
"Hot Fuzz" is one of my favourite films. If you want to watch something similar I highly recommend "The Baker". Similar setting, similar explosions.
but at least in snatch they  did explain it was not  actually Irish or English  so they covered their butts. LOL
My grandmothers Scottish and I have to say your accent sounds like you had my bagpipes thrown into the washing machine.
“Ahh sure Jesus”
0:25 Me: excuse me well at least we were top 3 unlike French Australian English and Swedish I kinder take offence to that
which county is sean from?
I say mirrrrrrrrrrrrrrr for mirror too
5:07 he sounds like Pingu's dad
A lot of accents are a result of people failing to move their lips a lot to pronounce their consonants. Watch their lips. The less they move their lips move, the more their words blend together and become indistinguishable for anyone who doesnt already know the context of whats going on
How tf does jack understand them
My great grandpa comes directly from Cork. I've always wanted to visit to see where my roots are....at least now I know I'll never understand anybody.
Just go look at Unus Annus- oh wait *wait*
I wanna see what auto generated subtitles can offer with the south Irish accent. 😂
Yes
Irish sounds like if New York was in Britain.
Everyday, we stray further from the English language.
Italy when they get beaten by Ireland: ITS TIME FOR COFFEE.
sub to my channel where you see me throw things and see people dropkick eachother
The sims language was based on Irish accents.
8:10 this guy looks like a younger version of the G man
Honestly the accents are a bit difficult,  But I've heard USA accents that are more difficult,  Not to mention people in my home country speaking What they think is proper English
But the Irish accent has nothing on the corpse accent
If I ever move or flee the country, I'd go to Ireland. I've never heard of anything go down there.
im irish and i cant even get an irish accent🤧
Oh no the news guy from the lost sheep video is just RTgame in my head XD
*frustrated linguist noises because the language used in snatch is an irish dialect of angloromani so obviously an irish speaking person wouldn't be able to understand*
The “I’m a vowel bender” line really got me
Me, a french girl, having finally mastered the British accent. Irish accent : *allow me to introduce myself.*
"get fucked Italy!" me: 🥺🙁
I say thank you if people call me a b!tch  Cuz a b!tch is a dog Dogs bark Bark are trees Trees are nature  Nature is beautiful   So they really are calling me beautiful and how can you not say thank you or you too
Ooooo those rowers look gorgeous 😍
i'm not irish but this was hilarious i cried a little lmao
Old irish guy: hashsvidnehhshalayeckwazkbdhzyxusjwuwvjsnzixhsblskzvsksopaveiwkd  Jack: he said hello
I can’t translate Irish accents but as a half Scot, I can translate Scottish ones. It’s a talent. 😌
You need to watch the Try Channel. It’s great! A bunch of Irish people doing hilarious things. And lots of alcohol.
You need to watch the Try Channel. It’s great! A bunch of Irish people doing hilarious things. And lots of alcohol.
👀 as someone who can understand baby, dog, cat, and most thick accents. Oh jeez some of em got a REALLY thick accent.
Why can't I find a cute, single lesbian who's Irish?!
Is Jack Gay? That would be cool.
Randomly came here, dude your hella funny
Twitter be like: Wow man, you are making fun of people with heavy irish accents, like they cant change their accent. Get cancelled
Geall liom nach féidir le Sean é seo a léamh más féidir leis mé a fhreagairt.
Christopher Walk-In closet
5:50 even the sheep farmer with the thick Irish accent was easier to understand then the Welsh lol
Call me kevin, the 100% irish boy couldn't even translate the farmer
now get a person from Dublin with a whistle lisp to say things that has a LOT of the letter S in it.
Breaking news! : Irish Man's Christopher Walken accent is better than Christopher Walken's Irish accent.
Seán: HA! eat shit france! French porn stars: *OUI!*
the only time you sound like that is when you play horror games and among us, don't worry hahahaa
Froshbutt
I CANT UNDERSTAND U IRISH  PEOPLE EVEN WITH FUCKIN SUB TITLES
You didn't do northen ireland 😔😪
“Down in BALLYHAUNIS” when u live in ballyhaunis :😳
I love the Cork accent
Best video I've seen in years due to jack.
5:51 at this point he sounds like he’s speaking japanese
OMG I hope you commented on that one and said no majority say aye not oil lol.
This should be retitled. “Sean trying to do an Irish accent for 21 minutes.”
Honestly, I don't hear his accent anymore. I've watched him for so long, it's kind of disappeared to me.
Okay, there's Irish *Irish* and *AERESH*
How to be Irish:  1) have a stroke 2) claim to be Irish 3) get drunk 4) profit
I love how everyone thinks we're a shower of bog hopping leprechauns...admittedly not entirely wrong but still
Mate, please, give us more of that!
jack how did you pronounce “thyme” correctly and not “herb”
jack impesonating irish christopher walkin sounds like arnold scwarsanegger
i wanna hear jack try an american accent
In Ireland, the accent changes every five miles.
Just found you thanks to David JP Philips react video, and I love this! Please do more/longer ones on Irish accents, I haven't laughed this much all year. Irish is a lovely accent :)
Wait brad pitt was supposed to be a piky is what they say in the movie. "They speak irish but its not quite Irish." Lol
SNATCH IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE MOVIES ARE you FUCKING KIDDING ME
Please review 'War of the buttons' it was my favourite film growing up. Its about Irish kids but I struggled to understand some of the thicker accents on it
Froshbutt frostbite
You're better at speaking Walken than Walken is at speaking Irish haha
0:23 Lmao
8:35 He absolutely 100% said  "frostbutt"
This was so much fun! :D
Sean’s accent isn’t thick at all. But you can tell and it’s awesome.
Being able to understant that man is a superpower
ahaha
This "the farther you go to south Ireland, the madder the accent gets" really hits home for me because I live in south Louisiana, and OH BOY. Our accents literally just turn to gibberish. i have a very strong accent and half the time when i'm talking to my friends i have another one that translates to them. Ah.. the life of having a fuckin wack accent
Havent wached in years but so funny Brad pit sounds like he's from the nourth Sean down in Kerry are some of the maddist ascents me thanks Sean -from kerry PS Kerry is the south west. Yor one teaching people how to say an Irish ascents got it so wrong
Does jack not understand people can immigrate from another country to Ireland and not have an accent lol.
Irish accents are the Minnesota accent of the world
As soon as you laughed I knocked over one of those cups we get orange juice (I had a spoon inside it so I heard the metal banging my desk). Those cups are light as fuck compared to a spoon.
He probably wont roast Brazilian accent, and thats saas
Wow congratulations to Daniel for expanding his branding to Raniel Taniel News
As someone from Ireland I am CRINGING
I'm from Dublin and I can say I barely understood the farmer😅😅 And the accent isn't natural strong it only gets stronger wen we're angry or trying to say something that sounds funnier in an accent 😂😂😂😂
It seems like the accent from Cork is the one that people imagine as the accent for the whole country.
"I don't sound like that... And if I do, I'm so sorry." XD 7:54
I am irish
He likes the people and scenery what about me irish pub
Pff fartyfive sheep
I didn't understand shit that angry man said. Is that bad? 🤣😂
Ireland forever
You should review the accent of the main character in Leap Year
I've been all over Ireland (not including UK, obviously) and the accents can get confusing as hell
What does a Irishman with a speech impediment sound like.
Irish accents never fully commit to a T unless there's an h involved
Um, Seán, that's a cow
Honestly...u used to sound like that.
I can understand that hard one. Maybe because i'm kiwi and ours is fucked as well lol
ah yes Séan Mac and Cheese
Fun fact my name is Ireland because my dad wanted to name that due to our family history being from Ireland-
I love Sean so much xD I love when his irishness comes out ^~^ ❤️
Jacksepticeye trying to be Christopher Walken is better than Christopher Walken trying to be Irish.
I was convinced that Irish farmer was speaking a different language until Jack said I'll translate for ya'
Me: I’m tired I’m gonna listen to music to sleep  Me: *sees this video* Me: f u h k
Thx for not talking shit about Australia yes i am Australian and yea Australian accent was 5th but its still there
Madeleine and Jeff are *racist* 🗿

The man who lost his sheep has discovered how to successfully speak in cursive.

ARE YOU RELE IRISH JACK
Connor McGregor really nails an Irish accent..look him up..
Ever seen "Secret of Roan Inish", when I saw it as a kid took me a bit to understand what they were saying.
Nobody: Jack: "Get *FOUCKED* Ialy!" yes i typed it in an Irush accent edit: Irudsh I'm so tired edit: Irish FOR FUCKS SAKES
The way Jack says herb is a perfect example of Irish accent.
when your irish you will say the word “mirror” weird 100%
I saw jacks eyes going up and down, when he was looking at how to do a a irish accent
:( aww... Jack is so homesick 🥺
I say mrrrrrrrrrrrr
The news i remember actually watching that the night ot was on
if I focus really hard on trying to hear what they're saying, I can just barely make some sense of it.
Have you heard Liam Neeson speaking in his Ballymena accent?
As a Scot I am so confused as to how we are 3rd sexiest accent
The vocal coach made her accent sound Scottish
I'm from Limerick and the inner city accent here is just the worst haha
You may have done this already - but you need to do a video about Irish names and pronunciation like siobhan 🤣
This is callmekevins video but on accents
"Limerick has the nickname Stab City" There HAS to be one of those places in every nation on earth. Just has to.
In the video with the guy with a really wierd accent, I thought he was speaking a different language😂
This is what any show or video sounds like to me without subtitles lmao
When Americans try to do an Irish accent I cringe so hard
There is a point that it gets to just loud mumbling
Brads isn’t that bad, I just can’t understand a word he’s saying.
'Irish accents are the top sexiest accent' Me: is that why I love Sean's accent so much? xD
When the sheep farmer says "What could be done about it? Nothing." It lowkey sounds like he's saying "De ble borte i natten". (Literally translated from Norwegian: "They became gone in the night"), it caught me so off guard lol
I quit a job due to one of the regulars having the thickest Irish accent it gave me so much stress trying to disifer and take the order
didnt want this to end
I couldn't even tell the Irish farmer was speaking English.
Dawg I literally couldn’t understand that one accent from the guy on the thumbnail and I’ve never felt so stupid😂💀
ah i love seeing rowing content covered by creators i like!!!
mate this was great craic to watch
COPYING CALLMEKEVIN?!
I live in nc and in yadkin county (mostly referring to those who live on or by the river) we call the accent yadkinese bc unlike normal nc southern all of their words blend together into a mush
You know you'd watch it.
2:20 he sounds like gru...
This video is essentially just Jack missing Ireland
What did we larn today? Don't try to fake being Irish!
"Eat shit France"  I support this message
THAT MAN WITH THE SHEEP IS SPEAKING AN ASIAN LANGUAGE IN HIS IRISH ACCENT I SWEAR
"Ha ha ha eat shit France"
Good job Irish, you have raised Becky Lynch and Finn Balor well.  Jesus loves you ❤️ 💖
So here is the deal Seán now a days no you don't sound like that. But then like around green haired jack yes,yes you did
If you think Irish people are built differently look at them Russians there's a video of one catching a bullet with there HAND and it's a flying bullet to not just thrown
Ok, now do an entire episode with the THICCEST Irish accent.......I double dog dare you!!!!
This is hilarious
Your not irish if you didnt think of the song when you heard wild mountain thyme
How would he know about Irish accents? He’s a fake Irishman.
I actually fully understood the guys in Rio for the Olympics, but I am SO GLAD that you translated the sheep farmer. Also, I am very glad that you pointed out just how many dialects and accents there are in Ireland. When my friend and I visited there about 4 years ago, I found that out. Some of the locals told us it's so common that there are different accents even only a few miles down the road, so thanks for reinforcing that!
That farmer sounded like if you recorded an Irish accent and played it in reverse. I did not understand one word of what he said. Jack translating it was a scene from Star Wars where someone is translating an alien language to English.
The old farmer guy sounds like he’s talking in old English from the Middle Ages
0:21 you did a good thing stopping at france
is that sheep guy even speaking english??
Something I just thought of... How do you feel about the boys in Boondock Saints? I love the guy... but why was their father Scottish?
Close captions make everything worse
The Irish accent is the equivalent to the handsome squidward.
*"I'm a vowel bender"*  *"perk, gaerdan, i say it like that anyway"* 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I'm usually great at understanding accents, but this video made me feel like I don't know English because I couldn't understand anything. Holy moly.
Anyone else realise Jack didn’t want to say anything about Australia. We are watching you Jack don’t slip up or we aussies will get ya
It would be interesting to see you react to different Newfie accents considering the strong Ireland connection. Idk what Ireland accent majority of newfies accents are based off of so it'll be interesting to hear what you think!
The dud said frost butt to me and no jack you sound understandable and I'm really american I was born and raised in california
Jack:drink more milk bitch
I rælly wæsh I cæd spæk læk Jæksæptækæ.
That was a lot of fun! XD I love accents so much. Irish is definitely one of my favourites.
ok im a big sucker for the french but irish just hits different
I've become way too accustomed to KerryCowboy's accent to EVER believe that someone really believed they could pass that English accent off... :/
is cornish like a deep irish accent?? orrr
It's not a jacksepticeye video until you make a hot fuzz reference.
Yo that school boy almost sounds german
Alternative title: Jacksepticeye Laughs At His Own Accent but like 24 different ways.
fun fact about Brad Pitt's accent in Snatch: Guy Ritchie got so many complaints about his previous movies because Americans thought the characters' accents were too strong & couldn't understand them. just to spite those people, Guy Ritchie purposely made Brad Pitt's accent so extreme that everything he said would basically be indecipherable
That was the best. Bless you for such great content, please talk Irishness again and as many time as you wish in the future, I had a blast
Woman: We say 'I'll' as in 'oil' Jack: ???? Also Jack: "Oil"
I just wanna know how the fuck us aussies got 5? 😂😂😂 we shouldn’t even be on that board
"Farty-five sheep"
Everybody in in cork sounds like cait from fallout 4
How to do a strong irish accent, talk like you just got a few of those shots that numbs your gums and mouth and are missing at least half of your teeth. Then try to do a British accent for half of what your saying, and for the other half talk gibberish or yoda talk, doesn't matter which one as long as its hard for someone to understand you.
I am a freaking questionmark at 5:40 ... what did he say xD ?! lol
In the start he sounds like Arnold
I love the Irish accent
Seeing Australian at no.5 and being Australian just feels like a lie.
What about Darby O'Gill and the Little People? It's got Sean Connery trying to play an Irishman.
American News: (CNN) - Coronavirus, Election Irish News: (RTË News) - OMG SHEEP ARE MISSING... BREAKING NEWS!!!!! 😂
I grew up around loads of different Irish people but I'm incredibly British however, I understood what the farmer guy said and surprised myself in the process
In snatch he isn't meant to be Irish he's meant to be a gypsy not necessarily from Ireland though but I get why you think that it's meant to be I only know so much about Snatch because it's my favourite film of all time and I know it word for word and off by heart
0:23  Me, an Italian: THAT'S RIGHT. FRICK YOU FRICKING ITALY.
Well that was fuckin fun to watch! Thanks Jack!
Irish(any irish accent i've heard) accent sexy?, lol, not at all to me. Nice accent but not sexy for me.
where is the hat
ceeeounty kerry
I love seeing you  make content about Irish people, you just get so giddy.
Id love to see the crazy sheep guy meet my EXTREMLY newfy grandpa and witness their conversation.   Scary
how to do an irish accent is more like Scottish
So no Irish actors?
Who else say Sweden amd laughed at pewds
somehow that school kid sounds about 60
5:21 this man must have throat problems carrying around an accent so heavy
Him, leaving out Northern Ireland, i'm from Northern Ireland
The guy with the heavy accent sounds like he's speaking dutch with a heavy japanese accent, I literally have no idea what he's saying
I DEMAND "Start drinking more milk bitch!!" merch IMMEDIATELY
I'm from te nordth,  I got some of what the farmers were saying but not a whole pile, understood the school boy clear as day, sounds like some people I know and he talks like my granny, understood the rowers fine
Seán, I can't tell you how much I love these kinds of videos. So much of my family lives in Ireland (it's basically my entire gene pool) and I haven't seen them in years. As soon as I heard the Cork and Kerry accents I went, "YEAH! WE'RE FROM THERE!" and I can't thank you enough. I miss it so much, and this video helped take me back <3
My face hurts now 😂
My favourite youtuber, my best friend, AND my grade 6 teacher are all irish
It’s soo cute how excited he gets when he talks about his Irish heritage 😂
who wants jack to make an episode only speaking irish
I love the Irish accent.  When I hear it I unintentionally pick it up and start talking like an Irishman.
beeehhhh
Irish people don’t say “Top o the mornin” huh? So Jack perpetuated a stereotype with his old video intros. I.e.; “TOP O THA MORNIN TO YE LADDIES! MY NAME IS JACKSEPTICEYE!”
Jacksepticeye(an Irish man): laughs at heavy Irish Accents Twitter: You're making fun of their culture? CANCELLED   Imagine tho 😐
Being Irish myself I couldn't stop laughing and more with Jack's reaction
i forgot how to speak english midway through this video
2:20 Jacks impression of arnold schwarzenegger.
Potato milk
I practice many accents so I sound like a Japanese Mexican lol
Sorry Seán, but the Oirish accent is the sexiest accent... for ladies. Feministas. Gals. Oirish on gents was one of the Top-10 most annoying.  Sorry.
Understandable: "There was a full moon out, so anybody could have come up and taken them" That guy's accent: "The rewa safullm oono ut, soanybody co uldha vecomeu pandta kenth em"
Now all I remember is the video "2 Men 200 Accents". It's not around anymore. But if you do go looking for it and find it, remember that it shouldn't be there, and probably won't be for much longer.
This sounds like norweigan sounds to swedes
Oh hey, Scotland came third Explains why my partner thinks my accent is hot
This is oddly endearing. I LOVE IT.
I love an irish accent, and that might be why you're one of my favorites
Honestly at this point it’s a whole separate language.
northern minnesotan people almost sound irish
Farty 5
He had a rawck tied to his neck! Lmfao
06:23 Anyone else thinking of Animaniacs' segments where they have Yakko and Dot translate fancy poet talk?
only a small porcentage of people who watch my videos are actually subscribed
I'll wait for the subtitles 😂
French? Irish? Scottich?!? I think german is thehottest 😳
Us boys in Northern Ireland get left out of everything 😔😔
11:00 she's doing an 'Oirish' accent which is a characature of the actual Irish accent that is used in international/ just not Irish stuff    I'm not making it up this is a thing and it's so dumb but if you don't do it  American and Australian audiences won't know what the accent is
Alternative title: Jacksepticeye shames unsubscribed viewers!  Stop it. Get some help.
Callmekevin did the same thing like 2 years ago
Holy shit I haven't laughed so hard in awhile!
3:46 yo jacksepticeye its pikey
All I heard was farty five
STEP ASIDE AND LET THIS REAL IRISH MAN SAY IRISH >:(
"WHAT THE FUCK JEFF!!!" *I'm CACKLING*
~nya nya ❤️ * *Blushes at you brightly and smiles broadly, her warm loving gaze resting upon yours. Wrapping you within the fluffy confines of her loving arms, she kept you held tightly and presses her body closely against yours. Letting loose blissful purrs, she parts her maw and laps her moist tongue against your cheek.* *    ~mrrow, if you're reading this. pwease have a purrfect day. I love you <3 <3
i mean i live in louisiana and most of us down here say mirror "mir"
When Jack translated the farmer. I was confused af. It wasn't near to what i heard!!!!
I have the most sexy dutch accent, brabants.
I liked your video before we got to this bit... But the video teaching how to speak in an "Irish Accent" is pretty generic. It isn't teaching a regional dialect from Ireland... Just "Irish Accent". It's like in the states... wait... you just made my point as I was typing. LoL! Not all regions of a country speak the same. LoL!
The sheep guys the only one I couldn't understand. My uncle is Irish though so.
This video is triggering the Irishness to level up in Jack's accent
I understood the olympians just fine haha
That school boy sounded almost Scottish haha
Cork?! My family is originally from Cork :D
"Frostbit"? I think not. He said "Frostbutt"!
Jacksepticeye does a good Walken impression.
I understood most of these accents, including the farmer who lost his sheep.
Thank you for making me so incredibly happy
In fairness he spend more time talking to Americans he probably has no idea what Irish people sound like anymore
Damn now i wanna watch sgt ducky
my girlfriends dad is from ireland so i can’t wait to show him these clips
I get jack on this it's annoying to see people do you accent horribly I'm south african and watching blood diamonds made my ears bleed
20:05 WHAT WAS HE GONNA SAY?
I could’ve sworn I watched this video about 2 years ago on his channel idk maybe it’s me
Nope I think Australia is the number 1 Irish is seconded I can say this cos I have sum Irish in my blood so yeah XD and how don’t you know what Mickey say I can here what he’s saying now Australians god  no one can know what we are saying it’s impossible in not to bad :b
What the heck is the one you say fuck the r in Ireland. I'm told it's Irish but I have no clue and it only kicks in with Irish music. Only one who told me squat was it's drunk Irish.
top of the mornin to ya im jacksepticeye
i wish you'd react to a Newfoundland accent, we're like a mix of canadian accent, british accent, and carried some over from irish and scottish. sometimes it can be pretty thick too that i cant even understand, an i grew up around newfies and heard newfie accents my whole life lmfao
🤣🤣🤣 love it
What I find it's amazing is Irish people never seem to move their mouths 😂 especially when they have a thick accent
I thought it was really impressive that you could understand some of those.
10:52 the face of pure disgust
Farty Five
soulda' just nemmed it irish.mp4
I like all accent even Irish I am half Irish and half Native American.
But Shawn I’m already in bed.....
at some point I thought I was hearing German lol
19:18 I couldn't tell Sean started talking until his laugh
Jack: this doesn't sound Irish at all Me a barbadian: thats exactly what you sound like to me lol
"Get fucked italy." "No luck for you, scotland." "Haha eat shit france." I am dying
Anything that isn't Canadian or American is better lmao
So that means tit for you is shish?
Can..can somebody tell Hollywood that Irish actors exist outside Ireland...?
As a dungeon master who tries to practice accents I will use this video as my practice accents. If my players cannot understand me then it sounds like I am doing it perfectly.
Jack should make a vid on how to have an Irish accent
it sounds more like scottish
I put Irish inflections on words for about a month and convinced my friend I was part Irish. I am not
Ok sorry but   *Farty-Five* 🤣
the lost sheep video was recommended to me a few hours before i watched this video....wtf...
He sounds like Autotune
You should’ve watched that “the strongest Irish accent you’ll ever hear”
What can be done about it nothing, is about the only bit I understood, I refuse to believe that was English 😂😂😂
Jacks impression of Christopher Walken doing a bad Irish Accent sounds more like Christopher Walken doing a bad Irish Accent than Christopher Walken doing a bad Irish Accent
Yep that's a Kerry accent for sure 😂💖
sean: "here i'll translate" the sheperd: wuhfaibwegiuabwhiojsnefiuabweifbawiebfiauwbef sean: "it was a full moon. very bright. anyone could've gone up and taken them." me: *no fuckin way that's what he said*
Jack saying they should have used Irish actors really reminds me of my sister being mildly upset they didn't use Greek actors in Percy Jackson.
Paul O' Donovan is a handsome devil.
i thought my guy was talking clingon the way you translated it made e question my entire brain
How is it I, who has never been to Ireland, can understand about 70% of what that farmer says. It's like I got most of the translation, and when Sean translated, I was just like "Yeah... I thought so."
Oof, that farmer.... I'm aware that he's speaking English words, but damned if I know what they are most of the time. All the others, though, I watch enough Acorn to understand them fine~
I can kind of understand most of it, sometimes they sound extremely welsh
Like how hard insults Italy and France but when it comes to scotland, is just no luck for you. A man who knows more, might know less.....
The thicker the accent, the less the mouth moves, the closer the teeth stick together.
Sean: I wanna see if any of you can understand what he’s saying Me: *is English and talks quick* I mean for the most part yeah 😂
I need to hear an Irish person say Howdy
I think when most people talk about an Irish accent they are talking about Cork
I WANNA SEE CORPSE DO AN IRISH ACCENT!!!!
How are you going to say you're a vowel bender so confidently, i heard Bowel bender and i thought jfc he called himself a poop bender
I saw the one where the farmer lost his sheep a few weeks ago. I understood the jist of it so I translated for my husband. He thought I just made it up because he didn't think the guy was speaking English. I used to "translate" for my mother when we would go to Louisiana to visit our cajun relatives and while that guy's accent might be a bit stronger at least he's not speaking a mile a minute like those cajun boys 😉
I mean, he might want to check his facts. Irish accent is third. South African is second and New Zealand accent is number one, babeeeeey!!
Bruh he skipped out on my accent at the very end: Northern Ireland
This British teacher came to our school and was talking abt bullying, and basically he asked us what to do if someone started bating ya and the whole class said bate them back and he got so mad 😭😭😭😂💀
Omg this was my birthday yay!!!
Mi and like 50 rs 😂😂
I'm from Dublin/Louth
I kind of under stud
Should have watched the pintman
You think Irish is hard to understand...try Newfoundland
I wish you did cavan LMAOO
all of them are awesome!
It sounds like a mix of English, swedish and Norwegian🤣😭
Me waiting for jack to react to the luck of the Irish😐
Jack: Please Ireland, let me back in!
I honestly doubted if I really know English or not lol
Next episode: Jack tries different accents...
You should visit Newfoundland Canada at some point, huge Irish influence in the accent and dialect.
go to donegal and youl realize our acent is kinad simmaler
I know some people probably have a hard time understanding even jack's accent, but I kind of grew up with that type because all of my favorite celebrities that I listen to speak all the time are either British or have a similar Irish accent to him. ex. Niall Horan basically has the same accent as jack
My great grandfather had a really heavy brogue and nobody in America could understand what he was saying most of the time
Crack me up about the two Irish rowers is as the camera slowly zooming in because the director is saying I can't tell which one's talking they're not movementing their mouths!
"Sheep Farmer" Sheppard...?
im northern irish JACKIE BOY  im a boy
I lived in Limerick for a semester back in uni and only after watching that clip did I realize that’s exactly how I pictured the Irish accent bc that’s how they talked there. And YEAH, it was stab city when I lived there, my friend lived next to a place where a guy got killed with a hatchet. I heard Galway’s the new stab city though, but maybe that’s just the Limerick friends insisting on pushing it elsewhere lmao anyway great lads down there 10/10 if you can ignore all the stabbing 👍👍
I never knew there were different accents within a general accent in Ireland 🇮🇪.  This was definitely a learning video for me.
That's what the FCE listening exam sounds like to non english speakers lmao Europeans will understand me!
Brad Pitt’s accent is actually pretty good if you acknowledge the fact that he’s specifically playing an Irish Traveller.
Does Jack not know about the rubber bandits?!?!bandits?!?!
Does Jack not know about the rubber bandits?!?!
9:40 BRUH I LITERALLY LIVE RIGHT BESIDE BALLYHAUNIS.
Seán, you realize we'd watch you go down any rabbit hole you found interesting. This was great. You could make it a series or something.( Jack's Rabbit Holes) lol
I don't really like Brad Pitt, but he did good in Snatch. He was not just portraying an irish man, he was supposed to be a very stereotypical gypsy, very over the edge, so that was the reason for all the gibberish. And he made the character funny also
2:20 jacksepticeye sounds like Gru from Despicable Me
In good crack..... I will use that phase for eternity
i have always wanted a strong Irish accents just so i can talk shit abt people and no one would know
Isn’t the sexiest accent in the world the French accent?
Fartyfive
Jack impersonating Christopher Walken impersonating an Irishman is the best thing I’ve seen all day.
The hot Fuzz reference 😍😍
This is not an accent, this is a completely different language.
When he pays Chris out but sounds love like gru
I've once had a conversation with an old irish man with this exact accent and by i had a conversation i mean i stood there for 15 minutes nodding and understanding absolutely not a word.
Why does the schoolboy look like a young G-Man.
8:09 froshbutt
I don't blame you for shitting on the french accent, it's not sexy at aaaaaaall
That Hot Fuzz reference is spot on. Such a good movie.
“I was hoping I’d be A-Louth to buy you a drink.” Sir, you could buy me if you keep talking. 😍🥵
i am part Irish and oh yeah that is how we sound
you should find a s clip of the character Gin from Yu Yu Hakusho. They made him Irish for some reason and he's impossible to understand sometimes XDD (The VA is Jerry Jewel and he's not Irish)
Or when Tom Cruise played an Irish man
loved it :D
Once you translate a couple I could actually understand 95% of the farmers!
Loved them all
This was amazing and hilarious! Thank you
I went to Ireland almost two years ago and I can say that some people did sound like that.Very thick accents were hard to understand
19:49 = I've got a horse outside
It's not all that  difficult, just have a good dog and go at night. That last part wasn't to hard to understand. Some English accents are the same way though. You should listen to J.R.R. Tolkien speak.
I'm laughing at how Australia is on no. 5 on the sexiest accent. Lmao
I can (sorta) understand what the sheep guy was saying. However it is kindly similar to deep southern accent (where I grew up) I knew a feller with an accent so POWERFUL you couldn't understand him, unless you knew em' pretty well
Yeah i watched the 3rd video myself. Im irish but even I find it hard to understand that accent its so thick.
That's was funny Sean. I appreciate the fact check to after this I'm flushing all my lucky charms.
Move over Duo Lingo,  Jackaboy's got this.   The best translator for Irish language is An Irish guy of course.
This is hilarious, made my day thank you!
I really want another one 😄
Yo, how did Jack get Christopher Walken to talk in this video for him?
More videos like this!!!
I'm Irish and I could not for the life of  me understand that farmer
You ask if that's (7:45) how we see you, I can say no for myself. You have plenty of clarity when you speak. In fact, you helped me practice an Irish accent for my DnD campaign. One of my players even picked it out xD
Swedish accent is the SEVENTH???  But Scandinavian accents are horrible! It's why I made sure to learn to speak British English without the typical Scandi accent.  Thanks to my Scottish teacher, I speak with a hint of Scottish English, though.
Why cant apples fly? I mean their seeds are brown.
Ha I could understand about 60% of what he was saying which surprises me since Ive lived in Canada for 16 years now
I'm Here To Get An Irish Accent Cause I Realized My St. With The Same Name As Mine Is Irish
I feel like the Irish accent is very similar to like a Boston accent you either love it or you hate it
Any ballyhaunis subs here
I went to a speech in Ireland and it literally started with try and guess where everyone is from. And the weird thing was we guessed their entire backstory correctly just by their accents. And when I was younger people always asked me if I grew up in Dublin then moved. It was true but I didn’t even know I had a Dublin accent
Definitely couldn't understand a word the sheep herder was saying.
Its mad the mount of irish accents there actually is
pronouncing ireland as oirland sounds weird to me as my irish impression is over-the-top and I pronounce it as AARRLND!
I live in Ireland and speak Irish
I find Scottish more cute than sexy.
i feel like jack's voice has gradually become less foreign to me over the years and it doesn't even sound very Irish anymore
I'm a quarter irish
Sweet fuck your own accent isn't exactly music to the ears.
"Every town has a different accent" Now this is a fact!  there is a reason you can usually tell what state (I'm from the U.S.) a person is from and, depending on the cultural influences, the rough area of the state the person was raised. I live in central Illinois and can usually tell when someone's from further north, like Chicago or more east like Indiana. People have fun trying to imitate each others accents around here, its like a game XD
i have a friend who lives in cork and i swear it’s so hard to understand lol
I think that third video is very unsettling to me because it SOUNDS like english And my brain knows it should understand it but i just can't understand what he's saying is this what other countries feel like when they hear english??
My favourite part about the Irish accent is that sometimes you guys pronounce "r" as "or"
Lolllll why do the Irish barely open their mouth when they talk? 😂😂
I’m 60% Irish and the only thing I’ve got to show it is the hella pale skin lol.
H E R B
I can only understand them when I DONT look at them
You all the irish accents other ths. The north in the last vid ffs i wanyed to hear my accent 😑😑
I'll start saying 45 as farty five from now on
I would pay so much money if Jacksepticeye made boyfriend Asmr 😂😂
Could you please do a video just in irish accent please🙏🙏🙏
in Dublin ye, the people roll their r's but only once it's absolutely fuckin werd
I could not understand brad Pitt at all and the farmer who lost his sheep and!😂😂😂 and I’m have Irish
My favorite accent was jack’s
i understood "45 sheep" and that was it tbh
C'mon, that blonde Irish rower sounds so much like Dathi.
that how to be irish video is mixing like 3 different irish accents😭💀
Can we also talk about how people mistake an Irish accent for a Scottish one??
You should play among us but amp up your accent to the point where nobody in the call can understand you
The same applies when people do an "American accent". We've literally got different accents depending on what part of what town of what state or what region. There IS a generic America accent where you can't really tell where someone is from, but most people have some sort of regional accent.
Ahahaha, "frostbutt"
Best thing ever is being from the north of Ireland and saying "murrrrr" instead of mirror
Those are the balymun flats they got torn down but live right across the road from one of them
You sound like that😜
“I think Ireland has to get something straight with...Hollywood”  Africa: First time?
I thought it was November 6th, so when I was this was uploaded on November 10th I got very confused
I think your accent was the best Jack
As an Irish person this is hilarious
gotta be my favourite Bradd Pitt performance
The Limerick one was definitely a nod to The Rubberbandits.
Brad Pitt came to Tralee to learn his accent in Snatch, he got it absolutely spot on,  that's how the travelers talked in The Bull Ring
Kinda lovin the north side Dublin accent
Is it just me or that farmer just talking norwigen
Totally get what Jack is saying as even every county of England, Scotland and here in Wales have different accents/dialects. As for the best accent...that crown goes to Jack's when it's enhanced by witnessing other Irish sources.
Up the most sexyist accent jack what county you from
I easily could have mistaken that mad Irish accent on the old man with the sheep for a Finnish accent
this makes me wish I was Irish lmao XD
wheres kenos haus?
Brad Pitt sounds more Australian than irish to me tho
I'm southern and there are some thick southern accents out there some times I can't even understand them take Jim Tom  from moonshiners for instance
Got so much joy seeing him watch the last video and just cracking up
Irish is the number 1 most sexiest Accent in 2019. I wonder what famous Irish Youtuber is to blame for that?
He puts on an Irish accent lmao he's not that Irish. Still respect tho
American people can’t do accents at all 😂 us British can cuz we come default with no accent
That woman is trying to teach us how to talk like the Swedish Chef😂😂
when jack said is that a shilling in ya pocket i don’t know why but i needed that
Watching fake accents is one of the most skin crawly cringe things to exist. Texas has a specific accent as well.. And you notice when some people just... Ugh....
Jack's Walken is better than Walken's Irish.
Facts should of Cast Eddie durkan and the boys for it
One thing less taught when learning to impersonate an Irish accent is the rhythm and tonality behind it. It's completely different than most other English accents, so you gotta re-learn how to speak in a more fundamental level.
i wanna see sean try to be american
bruh im irish but i have an american accent. i cant do an irish accent on command but i always say random ass words in the accent out of no where...
Well, just as there are many american accents there are also many different irish accents.
Irish are all about rally racing and that's awesome.  The last year has been tough in the sport there though. I suppose I mean 2019 because 2020 doesn't actually exist. But the do not stop.
Man, I feel really bad for that Irishman, he's missing 45 eyes... I couldn't imagine...
I could barely understand that guy with the heavy accent I understood some but definitely not the very first thing he said
Jack* dreadful   Gordon Ramsy* ugh dry absolutely dreadful
I first saw the sheep video a few years ago, and I just thought he was speaking Gaelic. I was not convinced he was speaking English.
that limerick bloke is likely mr chrome from the rubberbandits
Okay, I've not laughed so hard in awhile, thanks Jack! I love the "Irish accent"...all 50,000 of them! That sheep farmer guy was unintelligible. I think I picked out about ten words in all....sheep, sheep, and sheep, with an occasional 'mountain' thrown in for effect, lol
Me: "That sounds pretty Irish" Jacksepticeye: "That's the worst Irish accent I've ever heard!" Me: "That Irish accent sucks"
What happened to top of the morning ladies
Im sad cause i lost my accent
There’s a pastor at my parents’ church who cannot do any accent no matter how hard he tries. It always devolves into an Indian accent. Even when he tries to do Irish
2nd vid y the words in there
Your Christopher Walken accent is better than his Irish accent
I'm Irish but I sound more scottish than anything else when I speak in an irish accent, also when you did intros back in the begining, all I heard was the blood poring out of my ears cause I wore head phones,.
H0W IS SCOTTISH #3? I love it so so so sooooo much, but it's just noooooot sexy...
I’m 31% Irish, my last name is O’keefe and my head hurts from trying to decipher what’s being said
I don't know what this guy is saying in the  irish  accent clip
Jakes eye went naruto sage mode
The blindfolded guy in the "Which Accent Is The Sexiest" video is just embarrassing.
6:44 I always thought he was saying “Have a good jog”
So real irish or fake irish accent is better?
why are your eyes red ARE YOU OK?
Ok but you trying to mock Christopher Watkins Irish accent by actually saying it kinda makes you sound like a younger, less accented Arnold Schwarzenegger
The Irish accent is like speaking without spaces and full stops
The first one she sounded more Scottish, like merida from brave
This video is just that scene from Hot Fuzz but with more Irish. If you’ve watched the movie you know the scene.  Edit: oh he already referenced it.
fuck basically east coast canada lol
Is The shepherd who lost sheep what english speakers sound like to non English speakers?
Wanna come to Michigan, Jack? I actually worked at a summer camp, in which most of the staff were Irish immigrants, and they told me Ireland is a lot like Michigan, except Ireland doesn’t have snakes.
I don't know, Sean, I think I like Scottish accents more...
19:11 Look! He’s doing his Jack Septiceye impression! 🤪
Both sides of my family have ancestors from Cork county, so I look hella Irish. I want to move to Ireland to go back to my roots and I think the accent is sick.
I love how, the longer he listens to the Irish accent, the thicker his becomes
The translation ❤️❤️❤️
i shouldn't be laughing this hard ✋😀
England is like Ireland in the way that every 'shire'(Yorkshire) has a different accent
Tell me does the movie leprechauns sound irish
I have a TERRIBLE time understanding accents, but I have NEVER had a hard time understanding you :) You have a beautiful voice and accent!!
You should hear the accent of the Upper Michigan Peninsula and Northern Wisconsin.
You need to review Matthew Goode’s accent in Leap Year - now that one was bad 🤣
I’m from Limerick and I understood most of these perfectly 👁👄👁
Jack, you gotta review the Newfoundlander accent
Okay, the Vowel Bender comment made me laugh harder than it should've.
subtitles, as sean swears: "[__]"
Our Swedish national news channel (kinda like BBC) once reported on Irish farmers losing lambs to EAGLES.  I swear to God, the subtitles that would otherwise be in place, were just a series of ????? ????? ?????. It's as if the translator gave up! We almost died from laughter!! XD
We have DID, we have an Irish alter. His name is Geoffrey, he's a fictive (look into it if ya dont understand). The character he's come from is originally from Dublin, but left for London between the ages of 8 to 12, so his accent isn't as thick as would be were he to have grown up to his canonical age (which isn't specified but I'd wager in his mid to late 30s).  As for the man in our system, Geoffrey really enjoyed this video and got a helluva kick out it.
Jasus I could not understand a word and I'm Irish
i don’t even really notice seans accent anymore just because i’ve heard his voice so much lol
Who the fuck voted Scotland as the third sexiest? Have you heard our accent? XD
~fleueeehrhrrr~
"music, you call it" he says in the most musical way possible xD
I lost my mind when Sean started translating the Irish sheep farmer because I had no clue what he was saying and anything I thought was not even close
I've been known to drink too much from time to time when I'm distracted and not being watchful.  I was hanging out with some American friends when one such time happened and a couple of new folks we bumped into along our way asked me if I was Irish or if I had met the other Irish woman at the camp ground. It was some mighty compliment in my eyes, my family being from Ireland though I've never had the pleasure of visiting myself, but no I'm not Irish in the sense of citizenship. It's the Atlantic Canada accent with a slur I suppose. A bit Newfie. All mixed with them being Americans and never having heard it before so not knowing to where place me from. It was a great time.  Anyway I feel like you could throw Newfies on this list and they'd fit in quite well lol Seeing as though it's mostly Irish folks who populated this part of Canada it seems, I'm guessing that's where we get it from. Not many of us know what the Newfies are saying when they really get on the go with it XD
So South Ireland's accent is basically the Irish version of the "California accent" lol.
Just to clarify the end of the video langer is a cork slang word not limericks theres a song by tim o'Riordan entitled langer to prove it
"... irish people, you r greeet"    xd
I got ptsd from this video of that time for my English class we went to see an English play and I had no clue what was happening
PLEASE REACT TO THE BOONDOCK SAINTS AND CONOR MCGREGOR
I thought I grew out of jack...But I didn't...
I loved this video Sean! Hilarious
19:58 - Looks like the Rubber Bandits.
The outstanding archaeology therapeutically arrest because dry ideally blind pro a threatening invoice. scared, idiotic brand
Oh man I am from west Cork, I used to work behind a bar, now lemme tell you those accents in the video aren't the worst...
Y you insult me Seán coz I’m from  Cork
The Irish are like the Danes of Scandinavia. When we talk, it sounds like we have a potato in our mouth lmao.
Swedish is 7th? Why?
Sur lad I live in cork but the areas called Ballinascarthy
I love Cork we have a lot more space than Westmeath
Jack I’m Irish and some of them are so bad
its like they dont have any spaces between words once they know what they're saying.  The accent just makes it more difficult to understand.
Aye you wouldn't be long gettin frost bit 😂 ffs I love Rory 😂
as a fellow irsh man i can agree is the sexist accent ever
I recently encountered an Irish woman and I about melted when I heard he speak. I've always wanted to visit Ireland, all the more reason.
Personal Opinion: Yeah, Irish accents are cool, but I'd die for someone with a German accent.
a bit of listening, then the accent starts makin' sence. But I can understand some thick, drunk scotts, even if I live in London.
I'm just going to put this out there, I'm a sucker for Corkish girls.
Vowl bender kkkkkkkkkkkk
You should see what percant of your viewers are Irish for a video
"The irish accent" which one like? Theres loads of them.
That american video where they made those Irish people speak really rubbed me up the wrong way. Like why did they have to make them say such stereotypical things that nobody would ever say. While the Americans were pissing themselves laughing at them. Like they are just people not court jesters for the Americans amusement.
yo that christopher walken impression took me out lmaoooooo
also pronounce ireland just like arrland
yeah you're from the midlands so your accent isn't that strong. Im from galway/clare so i know the culchie accent and you defo don't have one
"h in an irish accent sounds like sh"  wait so if a irish person tried to say hitler it would be...  shitler...?
Now that I look at it a second time, this comment is very irrelevant.  I need more milk in my life. I've not drank milk since school which I'm not even sure if that was proper milk.
i feel like im experienceing what its like to not be a native english speaker. what the hell is happening???
Southern Irishman are the Irish equivalent to Southern Americans when it comes to "what the fuck did you just say?"😂
I feel affended that you didn't whatch the northern Ireland accent
it seems like southern irish accents have an almost welsh-ness to it which i guess makes sense, but maybe that makes it harder for americans to understand
I'd like to know what Sean thinks of Anabelle Wallis' Irish accent when playing Grace in Peaky Blinders
Southern Irish professional translator-  Sean
😢 but we love u guys 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿💙💚🇮🇪
I dont think the subtitles help with these...
My boyfriend is pretty sexy when he speaks a spot on Irish accent
Brad Pitt was in The Devils Own and played an Irishman in the IRA...he did even better job in that with the accent
No one  Not even the ghost of Christmas past   Jacksepticeye: *POLITICS*
this video is amazing
Excuse me, but you cut of the last one when it was getting to the accents in the North!
im very good at faking an Irish accent i hit all county's plus Scotland and Pakistan in the same sentence.
im irish and this hurts to hear lmao
More Irish stuff please, it's so fun
id rather listen to the Irish farmer than mumble rapers
Im irish and all this is uterr shite
“It all started when the Vocalbenders attacked..”
What about Sean macguire
On the Brad Pitt Irish accent...It's not supposed to be pure Irish, he's a Gypsy. So it's kinda of a mush of accents in there.
Why does  the guy  with  the sheep sound Welsh too😂
Yes I’m a child but yeet I drank milk everyday for 2 years pint a day and I loved it
Brad Pitt is not playing Irish, he is playing a traveler.
Actually these guys are so Irish that poor Jacky boy can’t decipher them
the rowers were easier for me to understand than anyone lol
I feel everything Jack said in this video, but convert it to the *Australian version.*
"I'M A VOWEL BENDER" I AM WHEEZING,  I FUCKING CAN'T  I AM DYING HAHAHAHA
i could understand the second sheep farmer, but the first one no way
You’re not fecking  allowed back in jack
I love being irish
Where’s me gold?     Heh only true chads get that    Ok it’s a leprechaun reference     Wait you don’t know what that is oh your lucky    Wait how long is this comment huh
Séan: No luck for you Scotland Me being Scottish: ;-;  (this is so old please kill me)
one of the last accents sounded like Nogla
I got all of the stuff the sheep man said except for “what can be done about it? Nothing” For some reason until you said that I just couldn’t decipher that bit.
People who are not irish are so bad doing the irish accent 🤣🤣
Na jack you sound great that farmer and my great grandfather could probs talk all fuckin day, 5 year old me couldn’t understand a single damn syllable from him
That was really interesting and entertaining. Id like to see more content with you explaining your culture
The captions Oh the captions... May they rest in pieces
19:52 how does jack not know the rubber bandits?!
Iam from County Wicklow
The fawkin kerry accent
I have a new England accent, certain things I say are very obvious. Instead of orange I say arange. so yeah...everywhere has different accents. I'm a Mainer and I don't sound like someone from another state. Maybe I sound similar to someone from Boston but thats it.
12:18 that's the same with aussie accents there are  different accents in each state. This happened to someone on thw internet where people were saying they weren't Australian because they didnt have the 'aussie' accent
He playes a gypsy guy
just cast Irish people if you need an irish accent gosh
It's not hard to understand.... It's so weird people don't understand them
Since you've left Ireland jack the stabbing in Limerick is actually much less common!      They have guns now
I want more of this. Much more.
'You're such a fearted ghoul!' That made me smile
Can you review the new movie wolfwalker?
I was hoping that he'd watch the video of the irishman locked out of his car by his dog but maybe next time.
Ok, the Irish Farmer might as well be speaking Gaelic at this point.
SCOTLAND 4EVAR
2:22 - I swear he sounded like Gru and i'm not saying otherwise
Now we need a video of Jack trying to explain how to do them Properly
When jack’s channel gets to its 10th anniversary he should make a video back to the good old cabin Like if u agree 👍
God damn it he just roasted my to blood countrys italy and France
Irish accents are crazy- like I know some Spanish and German but Irish sounds like something I’ll never understand, like oh my gosh- it’s very pretty but jeez
i'm honestly surprised that he was able to translate what that one guy was saying....the school boy too-
I want more of this.
I find the irish accent easy to do. Im used to it since i got a friend from Laois
Sean you should do a Boston accent.
Why can I understand the Olympic guys more than sean
No shame in movin yer lips, fellas. Give it a troy!
Hands down my favorite video. I haven’t laughed this hard and this much in a while. Thank you Seań.
I need boy friend
Ok but the O'Donovan Brothers are badass rowers.
I’ve heard so many hard to understand Irish accents I understood it all
"Hey yo Tommy?  It's wicked awsuhm bein Irish ain't it?"
Well oil beef hooked
"all ya needsa good doge, on a moons' lit night, make sure that they're welcome" He thinks...his dog...is the problem?????
maybe the farmer man couldnt speak english without some of the gaelic reiteration :I
the farmer is genuinely just slurring every single word on my god  also I love how Jack's accent gets thicker over the course of the video jfhdgs
*Take away side of mustache* *Take away beard* *Take away goat-beard* *Shorten hair*  _Irrishh Heetlehr_
Farty five!
The mad accent farmer sounds like he's speaking Irish not speaking English with an Irish accent LOL
Im scared to go to Ireland without Jacksepticy now, I feel like Id need help desperately but I wouldn't want to be rude 😂😂😂
In the movie they do say its Irish but not quite as they are travelers it is a weird mix of accents :)
I understand your pain. When I say I'm from New York, people want to know what borough I'm from and why I don't sound like I'm from New York. People automatically assume, when you say you are from New York, that you are from New York City. They totally forget there is a whole other part called, New York State. In fact, all the entire state of New York has several different accents and dialects. If you live in the east, you might say "pop." In the central part of the state, you might say, "soda." And, in the western side, you might say, "soda pop." )Just my own observation.) Pizza can also be called, "pizza", "pizza pie", or a "pie", depending on what part of the state you are from. I think it is quite interesting. And, it is always fun to visit another state, in America, and be told you have an accent. 8-)
Snatch is a legendary film. Everybody should watch it.
Fellow Irish where are you
i didnt know what a female person with any irish accents sounded like and all i could imagine was just a really pretty and nice girl and they open their mouth and its just "TOP OF THE MORIN' TO YA LADDIES" full on jacksepticeye voice and accent
@jacksepticeye Brad Pitt wasn't playing an Irishman in Snatch, he we playing a Gypsy Traveler that lives in the UK, therefore having picked up a part English accent as well. Turkish even says it in the film, "It's not English, but it's not Irish either"
Your accent is an accent I can actually understand, but the sheep dude sounds like a baby+a grandpa+a professional gibberish-er
BANDOOONNNNNNNNNN
I go to school in the west of Ireland around culchies and farmers and I can confirm that these accents are on point.  It's so weird that for such a tiny country there's such diversity and variation between accents.
Ballydehob and Cloonboo are some other funny Irish town names that I've been to.
This video made me laugh so hard! 😂 I would love to see a group of Irish people listen to different Southern accents from the US.
2:23 you sounded like Arnold Schwarzenegger there
The Irish farmer sounds like he’s speaking simlish!
Jesus, I couldn't even tell that was English
Im a 2nd generation American. my grandfather was born before my family immigrated from Ireland. Id love to go back and see the town my family comes from.
For me, sense my parents have the thickest Spanish accents for English, I understood everything with the thick Irish accents surprisingly enough
It's so bizarre being able to understand these thick, southern accents despite the fact I'm one separated from the heritage. Though my parents *are* irish, they've lived in Australia since they were about 20 and basically lost their accents aside from a few select words and phenomes they still pronounce irish-y. I basically got all of what the strong accented people were saying which is just.. odd.
A hundrd mirs
5:38 I believe he's talking about how there's going to be a full moon that night so it'll be bright out for the sheep to go up on the mountain
I feel like Jeff was way to into those accents for someone who never thought of Irish accents as sexy. Either that or he REALLY liked those pick up lines.
Narin eyen =northern ireland
This is kinda offensive to me 'cause i am part Italian. But I'm also part Irish as well, so...
Yes we have good accent 😏
6:07 this feels like one of those moments when you listen to a song backwards and try to understand the message, then the supposed message comes out and you can also hear it after reading it
please do one of ur own
As an Irishman I am confused
i thought our local farmer was hard to undrstand
"The reason for this video is because of Wild Mountain Thyme." Nah you literally ripped off call me Kevin. -10 respect
I'm Irish
I would love to go to Ireland someday. I have ancestors from County Tyrone. I have always loved the Irish accent.
Way to rob Call Me Kevin
Is it strange that besides Bratt Pitt's last bit I understood pretty much all of it without being an Irishman/ever having gone to Ireland?
That wild mountain thyme trailer feels like a spoof film or something. I can't believe that's gonna be a real movie lol
I'm sitting here laughing but I know some people here in Texas that would probably sound this bad to someone not from here.
Sounds like a sim
me, a non native english speaker when the real irish people came up: THATS ENGLISH?!
We need a scots person doing this! also sorry Carlos this is your girlfriend taking over you while your out buying me wine... but i mean it all the same!!!! any way who is scots enough to make this as good! p.s must do reginal accents! all of them! just saying.. it isnt one single accent btw ameria ...especially east and west.... dont start a war now. 'mon lets do this shite!
8:10 thats the g man from half life
I'm from Ireland 🇮🇪 to did you see the all Ireland final
The best!! I'm not the only one who wants more, right?
Yer man with the knife and the soar bag on his head was blind boy boat club from the rubber bandits, check out his podcast/videos/twitch stuff if ye haven't!
omg this is so scary lmao
12:46 The crush I had on Seán when I was 12 agrees fullheartedly
You have to love frostbit boy
Jack don’t make your ponytail too tight, you’re gonna get tension balding
I just noticed that Jack used a Irish trope as his intro for like 7 years. And Irish people don't even use it?
Jack does Christopher Walken better than Christopher Walken does Irish
I've cared for an elderly man from Galway for a few years now and it's probably only because of him that I actually understand most of this xD
It's only okay to laugh at the Irish when the Irish laugh at the Irish
You know who's really Irish Collins Darrell he has the Irish accent
I'm from Wexford, one thing everyone bloody says if they're from the town is "Howya huuuun" 😌
This is awesome.
I was living in Northern Ireland for a while for as a non-native English speaker. For the first two weeks, I thought the main language there were Irish or something because I wasn't able to understand almost ANYONE! Tough times
I was born in Ireland and forced to move away to America so I’m always happy when Sean does something like this
"Why didn't you just cast Irish people"... POCs and Gays everywhere be like... 👁👁
All people from cork know we’ve the best accent
I accents in generally are hard to get right. I cringe when some tries to sound jamaican
VOWEL BENDER. 11:16  Also, I enjoy an Irish accent. It's one of my favourite accents. ♥
I showed some of this to my mom (1/8 irish and 3/8 Welsh on her dad's side) and she was laughing so hard especially at "farty-five", this is great XD you should do more of these, new series or as a part of meme time.
BILLIONS OF YEARS, AND WE ARE THE CHOSEN ONES TO LIVE DURING THE SAME TIME AS JACKSEPTICEYE. YEEEEEEES
"I Just Say Mirrrrrrrrrrrrrrr" -Jacksepticeye 2020
peaky blinders
15:37 hysterically laughing dunno why lol
In fairness Brad Pitt was playing a traveller who, although originating from Ireland, have become a completely different entity altogether by now. They have a pretty distinct, kinda Irish ish accent but it's evolved and changed into its own thing now. And for a yank to take on the role of a traveller and pull that accent off as well as he did, gotta give the guy props for that.
Was that Irish farmer speaking English?
Lol, RTE declared a "language emergency" after seeing Wild Mountain Thyme's trailer.
"Eat Shit, France" *sad renault vitality noises*
what the hell is that jason flemyng next to brad pitt
5:50 omg either im dumb (most likely) or the old irish man started sounding kinda swedish,,, whats happening    (coming from a finnish person who has studied swedish for years but if u told me that was swedish i would probably believe u)
As i understand, Brad Pitt isnt really playing "just an irishman", but some weird gypsy type, hence the accent is different?
County Louth just sounds like a gay guys accent lol
Jack how the hell did you translate that I couldn’t even tell that it was English
2:53 художественный фильм... Ну, вы поняли
Yeah the hot fuzz scene is really funny
bless the farmer- only the fairies can understand him xxx
I liked the county cork, northern Dublin and Kerry accents, county cork is probably my favorite
Teacher: The oral listening test will be easy The test:
the only time i have a hard time understanding you due to your accent is when you're talking with nogla
Sean thank for not mentioning AUSTRALIA where im from btw aussie for the win
When they said we speak higher in county cork I literally creased
The accents in fucking doneralie are so difficult 😂
YouTube subtitles had fun with this one
19:10 tarrorizer?
10:30 LOOK AT GRAPH
21 minutes of pure Irish gold!  Please, Jack.  That was the hardest I have laughed in a while, 2020 has been so drab, but this... we need more of this.
Tbh I'm irish myself but that farmer has a mad accent I couldn't ever understand him
please tell me he sees Peter quint from Bly Manor
I'm Irish myself, but my accent doesn't come out normally. You either have to make me laugh or make me angry as hell for my inner Irish to come out. LOL  (Edit: Why do you suddenly like this? This was just random... Well, at least I got to see a lot of my fellow Irishmen and women here. :3)
Even the captions don't know what the guy is saying
sent by vladklast to day hi!
It baffles me that I could mostly understand that farmer, I guess I'm just used to irish accents
Please do this again and have the boys around when you do it
"Farty five"
Hey jack! You gotta check out TABS, they give that game a unit editor now!
And Jack wonders why everyone has trouble spelling his last name.
Why am i always smiling when i hear Irish accent??
Tbh the accent in Wild mountain thyme sounds more Scottish than Irish
I legit got distracted when he played the facts guide to Irish accents vid, because I recognized John Sharpson's voice.
Is Sean going grey?
Me, first part of that sheep farmer: oh, this isn't so bad Irish Farmer: talks faster Me: p a n i c
I too speak the Irelandish accent
M I and about 15 R's.....😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂  I lost it there!!!!
2:26 Why does Sean sound like Gru?
From what I know Brad Pitt was trying to do the cockney accent in Snatch.
I can relate Jack, I miss Ireland too! I don't want an american accent, I want my irish accent back!  everyone go here 20:51
New video series translating popular Irish videos make it happen Jack
My Grandad was from Northern Ireland and until the day he left us, I always struggled to understand him haha
My dad's dad had a strong Kerry accent and when he lived in Ireland he would joke with his friends that he could speak Kerry lmao also we went to visit one of his friends' parents and his dad was from Cork and I could not understand a single word he said- meanwhile I barely notice Dublin accents lol
Is it me or does around jacks eyes look like he's went sage mode?
Me. And Italian. Looking at us at #2 👁👄👁
My gran was off the boat irish, so i grew up listening to her accent, and every now and then it comes out in my speech. Its not very good by any means, but it reminds me of her, an i tear up a bit...
"Start drinking more milk bitch >:0"              *giggles*
You sound Scottish to me Ducky
Pitt's not playing an "Irishman" in Snatch, what he's going for is a bit different. Check out "The Devil's Own." He's actually portraying an Irishman in that movie.
I'm never again saying I understand English
This makes me want to do a video on "how to do an American southern accent" because I actually grew up in the south and paid close attention not to pick up the accent because I don't like it, but I can do it real good, mhm. I've seen so many movies where they just BUTCHER it and make it even worse than it already is. And country music...lort... They ham that up for the fans and it's terrible. Even worse that I know people who defend it.
You sound like palegis in skyrim
However you have to remember diffrent reigns in ireland have diffrent variations in their accents most in the north will sound more British while the south where i am will sound more well you know irish much like how you can tell if an American is from the south or the north because of their accent
Nah how to be Irish you just gotta yell out your words
Sounded like Brosnan's accent when ye said flour and sour.
I literally only understood the word sheep from the farmer.
Jack: "Cork has a *very* strong accent." CallMeKevin: "Erm..."
Does jack not know the rubberbandits, that’s the lad from Limerick with the spar bag, can’t believe an Irishman hasn’t heard horse outside hahah
ok yes I'm irish , yes I'm scottish but I've never been to either and I understood them all even without jacks translation °^°` I be kinda proud of myself lol , also that kerry gal sounded british oof
Like what the fuck im russian, watching irish man watching mad irish accent videos
wow he is a natural at the irish accent
Ya irish really are " something else" 😂😂
30 seconds, 30 fuckin seconds in to the video and I’m LMAO🤣 I don’t think I’ll be able to finish it 😅 I’m laughing to the point where there’s no return 🤣🤣🤣
I miss his potty mouth
I’m Irish i just sound like Jack ahahah
What about sheagorath the daedric prince of madness
But I'm from America but my ancestors came from  Irish
My ancestors came from from Irish so I got I got Irish in me DNA
The sheep farmer reminds me of my grandpas neighbor in Georgia, I couldn’t understand a damn word he was saying but him and my grandpa had a full fuckin conversation. I under my grandpa fine but fuck it was weird
I literally died with the Limerick representation XD I studied abroad at UL and I lived off of spar next to Plassey, not to mention the "stab city" part that was shown in the doodle lol
I really, really want to have an irish accent. But the british accent part of my voice is overpowering XD
The only Irish person in Wild Mountain Thyme is Jamie Dornan. Truly amazing.
T>T Im french 😭 no really but I'm is it really that's cool!!!!
They haven't heard my accent the women love it, and the men hate it.
Step 1 - Have a stroke Step 2 - Claim to be Irish Step 3 - Profit
I’m disappointed he didn’t know the rubber bandits
like. you _definitely_ sound Irish, but you're much, MUCH easier to understand than some of these omfg
Haha my dad is from cork
I have the same last name as miley joe o shea haha
I want a video where he’s only talks and says Irish thing
Try to understand someone from eastern Kentucky..
Sean did you live in the south side of Dublin or the North and have you ever been to northern Ireland
for me the 2 sexiest accents is Irish and Scottish.....LOVE YOU JACK!!!!!
I swear my name is italy and I was distracted so when I heard "GET FUCKED ITALY" I was like woah woah woahhhhhhhhhhhhhh   then I realized  it was talking about the country
dude we had to do an Irish accent for my theatre class and we watched that one tutorial video with the woman and I swear-
Honestly Jack even Walken's could of tricked me if I had never known who he was :). I really wouldn't of had a clue lol it would probably be a fun game to play with your friends or other youtubers to see if they can guess a real Irish accent from a fake
this video is for irish people only
Kevin watched some these The sheep one to be specific
Pitt sounds more like he's from Newfoundland in Snatch.
The fact that you may not understand someone that is speaking the same language just because of a different accent is fascinating, but the Irish? They are sumtin else, they have made it even further beyond, to the point that no one ever will catch up to dem mad lads.
Jack literally called out every 12 y/o out there
*The farmer is just using irl encryption*
5:05 English densifies
Mama Mia
Althout America does have a few distinct accents I find it really interesting how in England and Ireland you can travel just a couple towns over and hear people talk completely different from you to the point you can barely understand each other. I would say America has about 4 or 5 distinct accents. If I were to travel a few hours from my home, no one would know I'm not from there. If I were to travel long distance ~15+ hours drive is when I would start to run into people who even noticed I was from somewhere else. It's like really different in the UK.
Honestly the most interesting accent is when Daithi sounds like he's going to blow a blood vessel at Kevin's antics. It's like an accent all of its own
Scottish farmers are the same. It's like all the Celtic farmers gathered generations ago and decided "we need to make sure everyone immediately knows we're farmers".
"beautiful moon... bright out.... mountain... light show? "  "45 sheep missing ... lamb..... count out a nice bit of mollywag?? that's all i got from the farmer lmao
As a Northern Irish person, I feel especially left out that we weren't graced with the godly accent that is *bleedin' eyeereish*
I shall swoon milady with an Irish accent now. Hope she is happy with the sudden accent change.
The all irish are farmers stereotype
I've never been asked to say top of the mornin' to ya! but a woman in San Diego airport, when she found out I was Irish, did ask if I could do a little dance...I was just looking for the Aer Lingus check in desk
“pstalavorshkinlockin” “tutulumarleshues” “hiletsportet” “ushustoshoedtubarlockin let’s be honest vartestoplevirelande” This is HONESTLY what i heard
tell me why the man with the missing sheep sounds german 😭
Great video! I can watch you talk about Irish accents all day!!
kerry people were never ment to learn the english language
Tf is an English accent
The Limerick fella with the spar bag as a balaclava had me rolling “shtab city bais”
6:06 me : is that man speaking  german ? O.O
I loved this video :} enjoy this. I am from Michigan and we do not say Mirror.. We say meer. lol.. Maybe a little Irish there ?
when he said "rosemary maldoone" he had to charge it up  like "rosemary malDDDDDDDDoone":0
I have an irish akcent becuse i was living in Ireland
I’m having KOTOR flashbacks this is what the Twi'leks sounded like
"I'm great at doing an Irish accent"  - Séan 2020
I understood NOTHING ...... JUST THE WORD SHEEP
the best accent is quebecois, ngl
Sounds like you may be having a vowel movement there
Isn't it confusing how you can have 25 million subs and only 2-4mil watch your videos? It's the same with selling anything or having an insta. I don't get it
it sounds like that farmer is speaking a different language
14:59 oii! Theres Louth! Thats where im from and where im at hey XD
To be fair, Brad Pitt was doing an Irish traveler’s accent. Isn’t that a different accent? Irish travels in the UK aren’t really Irish or British, they’re their own lot
Just heard that as "frostbutt"
This reminds me people on the East coast in Canada. Great people but can be a little difficult to understand (and they know it) LOL! However if I am not mistaken a lot of them have irish lineage so it would make sense.
Well hey whats the craic jaic
This is like Americans watching doctor strange
I know why Hollywood casts American actors to play non-American characters (star power), but the least they could do is get some voice actors to dub over their lines if their accents aren't up to snuff.
The drink more milk bitch just changed my mood instantly
We say Areland not Ireland or Oilrland
This is how you know Jack is feeling home sick 🤣 being from the Midlands and listening to the Kerry accents is like higglety pigglity
My accent is something called Pennsylvanian Dutch. I don't  say "sugar". It's more the line of "Sukar". It's more the line of bastardized version of German. Mine is light, I think. You just have to listen carefully.
i never commenr but ok maybe i will
The fuck are these Irish people saying?!
He straight up said *H* *E* *R* *B*
I feel like I’m watching my sims interact with each other, have a small idea what they are saying but not completely lmao
VIKING at 08:25
half time couldnt tell if they whey talking witha accent or speaking Gaelic.
God and people say that the South US is hard to understand
Irish people: *speak with a thick accent English: Am i a joke to you?
The only irish accent i know is I'll becomes Oil
Bruh
where do you live now jack
The kerry one is english definitely
The field 2:return of the yanks
From kerry and I can't even understand the farmers
Haha that school lad said sounds like my uncle paddy 😂😂😂😂
I feel so bad for the farmer tho!!! 😢😢😭😭
The movie should be scottish
tbh I'm German and it's so hard to understand accents/dialects from other federal states or areas. hell, cologne is like a 30-minute drive from here and they speak weird af ;D  also, I might start learning Irish next year (if I survive uni till then)
irish baking videos be like so i,m gonna get the flair now
I'm convinced every social group (like 12-15 people) develop what is essentially an accent heavily influenced by their parents and community. When millions live in the same city, the *accent & dialect* basically changes based on which school you go to, then social circle.
I feel like I am in Hott Fuzz during the sea mine scene!
You try saying that with a shalaylee up you arse.
Why is it in movies with horses you'll see someone slapping the ass of the horse to make them run?
I was severely impressed when he was able to translate that 🤣🤣
the cartoon man with a bag over his head is Mr. Chrome from The Rubberbandits
I love Jack's random tangents so much...
TELL ME YOU LIKE MY HAT
As an Irish person, this is hilarious! Btw, I understand the fella that had some of his sheep stolen or missing
I wonder if he'll watch a video on different American accents next.
Sean does a better Irish accent than these people do Irish accents
So the sheep guy, was he half Englishing half native languaging? Or is his accent SO strong it just sounds like he's speaking a different language? I really am curious, I have no idea, I am not trying to be offensive...
they should of asked jack to narrate his own life.  It would be 200/100
Brad Pitt's wasn't supposed to be "Irish" like Hollywood thinks of it. It's supposed to be Irish Traveller
This entire video was just me going w-what
Irish people have the sexiest accent bollox they clearly have never heard a Welsh accent lol
The more clips in this video the more I would say brad pitt's accent was pretty accurate.
Getting frostbutt.
My brother is named sean. So I know that spelling. I know it better the american spelling.
Turn on cc then the farmer said  bituminous
I first thought the guy was speaking either German or Danish.
You know it's bad when even the YouTube captions can't translate... 5:05
The Irish won’t change for anyone, don’t fret Jack
the farmer: dlhkcgkevjgckufeakjchkjefvcku jack: ah he said, "Hi how was ur day?"
09:20 I didn’t even notice the guy on the right was talkin
"Brad Pitt, you're lucky you're gorgeous."
Is it bad that all I really heard from that name was Seán Mac n Cheese???
*When you get aggressive after playing Among us @ Jack😂
lol midwesterners in america do the same thing with mirror
Why did you reacting to bad impressions of your own accent give me the best laugh of the night so far? I have to show this to my roommate. She desperately needs a good LAUGH!!!
The frostbit kid showed up to his last day of school on a horse, he lives in my city lmao
you should check out the try channel
Hey jack whatch the The Boondock Saints you will be surprized 😂😂
The Irish accent sounds like a leprechaun dragging is balls across glass
If this video taught me any damn thing its that the phrase "Irish Accent" is a VERY broad spectrum....somewhere between 'beautiful' and 'what the actual fuck are you saying'?
That Irish Farmer... damn I dont know what it is... maybe because I speak Spanish so accent sound different for me or something... but I heard that Farmer and at least half of what he is saying sounds German to me it's so weird.
Yours is best👌🏻🥰
For some reason I just had an epiphany, that jacks brother, the one that likes metal and stuff, is also Irish.... I wanna hear him
Strangely Sean doing a bad Irish accent sounds like Arnold Schwarzenegger lol
I love foreign languages
did anyone see this and think of the comedian Michael McIntyre going to the dentist and saying mirror
Irish accents are my fav and I simply cannot explain why. Also I think Brad was also playing a gypsy if that would affect it.
"It's a haerd thing to do" -Sean
3:18 if a movie has jason stathan in it it's a really good movie in my dad's persepctive, he loves jason S's solo movies
Oh no.. for some reason the more I watch Irish people.. slowly but surely my Australian accent becomes Irish.. how is that even possible? Hahah 😂
Wooodn belong gettin frostbutt!
I'm not Irish but for some reason I didn't hear any accent whatsoever from any of the people in the video except the farmer, the Olympians, and the frostbite kid. Being from America I thought I'd hear the accents stronger and not be able to understand them but I could understand all of them so much so that I didn't even hear much of an accent. I understood the Olympians and frostbite kid and heard their accents and could understand the farmer if I really focused on his words but none of the others sounded very Irish to me some even sounded borderline American. I kinda found that interesting lol
I’m Italian and Irish and I have a little bit of an Irish accent
At 4:28 what are they saying? It sounds like ah byze, but what is it?
Of course he didn't do northern Irish
"Farty five!!"
Heavy Irish accents is as close to speaking cursive as a human can get
They are just tryhards
No worries. You only get that thick of an accent when you get really excited or scared but we still get the message lol.
Anyone else that’s Irish this is painful hahaha
I love how when you hear a familiar accent you slowly slide back into it, like how jack does in this video lol
frostbutt
just skipped the north lol
Mirrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
oops i went
19:50 How do you not know The Rubberbandits???
Brad Pitt’s accent was actually fairly accurate for the role he was playing in Snatch. That’s a Tipperary perspective anyway.
I actually fell in love with the Irish accent in the movie Leap Year, the 2010 romance comedy   I love it so much I watch it like once a year if I can, definitely recommend it
Pun cake
My grandpa's an O'Shea and he's from Waterford, I could be related to this man XD
You do a great Christopher Walken impression 😂
"Get fooked italy" loved that one :DD
Brad pits accent was on purpose, that was the joke of the movie, no one could understand him.
I can understand it because that’s how my great uncles Irish accent sounds, you get used to it over time
So I practiced my Irish Accent being like its not accurate at all 2 videos of Irish accent to to do and Irish trying to say Irish wrist watch complettly just guessing off of how I would say it still thinking its shite and heres Jack saying its a specific accent meaning that I self taught myself how to do a vary specific Irish accent with little to no outside help Im still not saticfied please help me im going further into the abyss ahhhhhhhhhhh
This needed Big Joe Joyce videos
Lol tis true, we do say mirror like 'mirrrrrrrrr'
The wettest T’s like you wouldn’t believe
Christopher Walken is so awesome I don’t even care how bad he sounds 😂
I loved this so much.
I'm glad to see that SPAR also exists in Ireland
Love, love, love the Irish accent 😍😍 but yeah Hollywood does make a massacre of all accents in general.
Thank you for interpreting all the strongly accented speech!!
the way he said thyme is fascinating
The sheep farmer: Harder to understand than the co-pilot in rally car games
Hi
Me and my 10+ years of learning and speaking english: 👁👄👁
im Scottish and kinda confused
Haha I didn't really know what the old man was saying but I knew what he was saying if you know what I mean.... I'm from Newfoundland and my family is from Ireland, our slang and accents are a mix between Irish, French, amd English. And our slang is hard to understand, and like you said the next town over is a different breed of people haha amd accents
I’m from Alberta... and neyfoundlanders sound kinda like a toned down version drenched in maple
Hahah awesome
Great video Sean, it was fun and pretty funny to see different Irish accents, as well as what you thought about them
Herb with an h.
Now you understand what it is to be Southern in America...🤣
@10:36 Nay, I'll do it when I wanna and not when ya tell me to!
Thank god no ones heard of the somerset accent
“Ha Ha, eat sh1t, France.” 😂
You can hang your clothes in me. Who am I?  Answer: Christopher walk-in closet
**Cries in being Irish**
wHAT the fUCK, JEFF
my list of most attractive accents (in order): Lithuanian  Irish Manchester (Britain) Newcastle (Britain) Scottish
I read it as “Irish accents are the most sexist” and when I tell you I was confused- 🤣
The frostbite one actually makes sense. The verb form of frostbite is frostbit, so saying "you wouldn't be long getting frostbit" sounds weird, but it is actually grammatically correct.
Anyone gonna tally how many times Jack says "Irish" in this video? 😂
Which kind of accent do you have Jack?
It's like when you ask people to do a New Zealand accent, it always sounds Australian...
6:00
This makes me wanna watch "Father Ted" again.
Damn! Your Christopher Walken impression is better than 95% of other people's efforts.
Honestly this is what it was like for me when i first moved to Northern Ireland last year lmao
5:30, that sounded like Japanese.
I love being irish it’s the least amount of effort and the most amount of craic
Did anyone else hear "Frostbutt" instead of "Frostbit"?
2:26- Why did he sound like Gru from Dispicable Me
the irish vocal coach pronounced flower as fleur with a really bad french accent. fleur is just flower in french lmao
fuck, we are number 5 on the list, i thought us aussies had the best accent aha
Tfw you recognize several of these accents from videos with jack and the Irish lads and it makes you want more videos with all of them together going nuts
my man Mikey was speakin in keyboard smash
I’m pretty sure the the sheep guy also had, like, 4 teeth, none of which shared the same zip code👀👀👀
5:37 did he just say “elytra”
My ex-boyfriend is Irish. He once told me about how someone said, "Your Scottish accent is so sexy!" He told them he was Irish, and they said, "That's basically the same thing!" ....And he spend the next hour raging at them.
Search up bad newfoundland accents
Idk why but this was the video that pushed me to finally subscribe to Jack 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 I couldn’t stop laughing bruh. This was too funny!!!
I've never laughed more in my life tbh,this was hilarious my stomach actually hurts😭💀
Na man British alll       the         way Have you heard lusefers voice on Netflix 🤤
You can't even argue white washing with White Mountain Thyme because irishmen are already white.
i appreciate the county cork love in this video
6:46 'FORTNITE!!' LMAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Jeez this is hard to listen to. Walkins is trying to mix his normal voice with mafia and Irish...not a great combo lol. Now just need him to sing
Here in Dallas, we've set the record for most violent crimes committed in one year. The national guard is being called in to help the police because its just that bad....... meanwhile in Ireland some one stole some sheep.   Yep time to move to Ireland.
Sounds like if Boomhower from King of the Hill was Irish🤣🤣
Hands up who is Irish
i cant understand anything in this video. what was the guy with the headphones saying?
dude,  America has some good, one bad and a boring accent. I had to get the boring accent. In the west coast everyone is monotone. its like texting with all lowercase. We all know what the bad one is . . . depending on what you prefer for an american accent. A lot of people talk smack on southern accents. East Coast accents are really attractive
dude,  America has some good, one really bad and a boring accent. I had to get the boring accent. In the west coast everyone is monotone. its like texting with all lowercase. We all know what the really bad one is . . . that's all we're known for and I can see why. East Coast accents are really attractive
13:29 Woman: Hello there Jeff: Hi Me: Kill him. Kill him now.
Irishman laughs at Irishmen and not-Irishmen
fr i have never seen a SPAR in Germany BUT than i got to ireland and i saw a fuckin spar an i was like: well thats kinda crazy
19:15 THATS SEANNNN
Should do reacting to welsh accents, they can be crazy and really varied, it’s my home country :)
It's strange because I understand the heavy Irish accent but I don't at the same time
5:28 Farty-five sheep? That's a lot of gas
Shines flashlight up on face, “I’m the LEPRECHAUN! GARTH! Do not steal me pot-o-gold! Where you gonna move? Are you gonna move to IRELAND? THE LEPRECHAUN!!” Sorry I can’t help the Wayne’s World reference!  But genuinely I LOVE Irish accents and wanna visit Ireland AND Scotland SO BAD! I was supposed to go to Castlbar back in 2005 to compete in a world karate tournament, but it sadly didn’t work out.
When Sean said “sexiest accent in the world” the auto captions replaced “accent” with “accident” 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
A lot of times I don't even notice Sean's accent unless it's being directly compared to another accent. My grandmother was from Mayo Ireland and for many years when I was younger I didn't notice her heavy accent at all. Most accents just fade away very quickly with me.
"Get fucked Italy!"   Ah. Sean I missed you lmaooo
You can actually tell that the Background is real because you can see people walking in the parking lot at the bottom right
The second time he said have a good dog the captions said “have a good dragon”
Take a pee at the Comfort Inn??
Damn I can do the top ten most sexiest accents in the world I’m like freaking hudini
Well ... Oil beef hooked! Those were great accents! ;)
Being Scottish really helps to understand Irish accents😂
Hey jack do you believe In Vikings for your ancestors? Of you do did your parents tell You
Paul O’Donovan can **get it,** tho 👀
I live in Scotland :(
“That’s what we do in Ireland, we make fun of each other”   It’s called “slagging” each other and it’s one of the things I love about being Irish 😂
Please do more of these, it’s so funny watching other people react to Irish accents 😂😂
Voice coach: OiErLaNd, fLaRe, hOoM Me an Irish person: *no*
To be fair to brad pitt he was doin an irish travellers accent and it's pretty on point
This is just jack when he’s procrastinating. But the camera is on.
I don't know if it's because I have a heavy southern accent but I understood most of what was said..lol
I immediately thought of that part from Hot Fuzz as well. Every time I watch that part with a friend, they laugh so hard that I need to pause the film.
jokes on you i cant even understand like any irish accents
Pause at 9:23 if you want to stay awake at night
I would be flattered and ashamed to watch him react to my videos. Watching him cringe at my fake Irish accent would be an experience.
my neighbor is from Cork.
The teacher: The listening isn't that hard!  The Irish Listening: *farmer loses his sheep*  I mean, I understood most of that but in Irish it's 10x worse LMAOO
I was either super confused or laughing so hard while watching this video😂😂
He's right. Not irish at all
Irishman (Limerick) abroad here lad and that was funny. I love going home and listening to everyone. For the first few days I have trouble understanding people and it all sounds so funny to me but in the end my thick Limerick accent comes back out and my speech increases in speed. Then for a few days after I return to my new home no one can understand me and I have to readjust again. 🤣
Just an FYI; the little cartoon of the guy with the plastic bag over his head is Blind Boy from The Rubberbandits! Absolutely worth a Google to any non-irish folks reading this, he is a legend!
"there's a lot of examples of people trying to do irish accents and it sounds dreadful"  is anyone reminded of ethan's northern irish and mark's how to train your dragon one
The man who lost his sheep is literally speaking Russian, German, and Japanese
Didn't they just recast Fifty Shades of Grey, but this time he's not rich?
That accent offed all Kerry people
Dude sounds like he's speaking medieval
Öil
Anyone else live like an hour away from skibbereen
jack: i dont sound like that also jack: schoolboye wit tick accent
I watch your videos on my oculus quest 2
9:40 lad I live in Bally haunis in ireland
nobody: jacksepticeye speaking in his own accent: "I'm great at this!"
I’m Irish and honestly the girl that’s “teaching us” to speak Irish is hilarious
One I can speak very fast two I can understand people who talk very fast
Froshbut
My Uncle lives in Skibbereen, lovely place
Family guy: "You're from one town over so I hate chur guts"
oh my fuck, I was living in Ireland for a bit (I love Ireland btw I wish I could go back) and Irish accent sounds wonderful and at the same time it's fucking hard to understand for me. every time I was at shop or I was talking with locals at the bus stop I was like "....w h a t......" it took me month to learn to understand better XD I was living near Cork and traveling in that areas, I was also in Shannon, and I've meet people with so many accents, that's fucking crazy
What.. I thought SPAR was a South African thing XD
Jack we have an accent in Lincolnshire you'd just love check out farmer wick goes to london 😉 you'll thank me later.
*cries in english as a second language*
WHAT THE FUCK JEFF!
Lol at the Gerard  Butler reaction. To be fair though, he can't even do a Scottish accent anymore!
I caught everything the rowers were saying, nae bother tae ma ears Jim. Scottish btw, East of Glasgow (Glezga).
I didn’t search or know about this video(even though i follow the channel), but I don’t regret watching this after the YouTube algorithm led me here. Pretty interesting and good fun this was.  Thanks Jack!
Jerk
him trying to imitate their Irish accents makes him sound like Arnold Schwarzenegger
that man with the real accent, *that's supposed to be english???*
"Get fucked Italy!"😂😂😂
jacksepticeye: Why don't they just hire irish people BECAUSE THEY ARE NO GOOD IRISH ACTORS only joking
wow, you are such a jerk. With all your foul language.
Listening to Sean without bells is hard to understand.
He said getting frost butt. Those Irish peopled are a hardy lot, how could yo sit down if you got frost butt?
Probably....Kevin is way more Irish than you Laddy....keep your Slang deeper.
I just love everything about this video
😃
It all sounds beautiful to me  <3 Much love from Demark
It feels like like God spilled liquor on the Irish when he was writing their OS.
Only understand sheep
the rower sounds like a Jamaican man trying to pass as a white boye
I don't mind you looking at Irish videos it makes me appreciate my Irish roots
noiceeee
I am not Irish, but I know that is some terrible Irish accents.
Ur christopher walken impression is phenominal
It’s funny how she says the music of the Irish accent (10:28).  I’m a scouser and when I was in Peru one time, the Spanish speaking people in a local town tbought I was singing every time I spoke.
You should take a look at the Newfoundland accent. It has a lot of ties to southern Ireland. Older people in Newfoundland sound just like the man with the sheep.   Its the same way in Newfoundland, every town has a different form of the accent
"there are a lot of examples of people who don't have Irish accents who try to do Irish accents and it sounds absolutely dreadful"   ....Ethan.....
Irish the language hard to learn yee
British Man: you speaking gibberish aye? kinda stupid innit!
I understood most of the missing sheep report... and some of the others that followed.... strangely enough.  Also, I love the way that guy says "frost bit"
Liked it anyway
Loved the video deserved a love not a like
Irish accent is the spoken version of a doctor's handwriting.
lol I can almost understand that guy . I can't tho.
I really should go back to sleep. I got a total 2 hours ;-;
The sheep farmer Mikey sound like he’s speaking a different language in an Irish accent
Yes Irish women’s voices are soothing
I’m not convinced this is English
4:31 clean ya nose you irishman
frost bit boy is a national treasure up north now...
2:21 sound more like Arnold Schwarzenegger
It just sounds like they aren’t opening their mouth all they way 😅 I am terrible at accents lol I could never convincingly do a different accent then my own!
Some people say that the Aussie accent is similar to the Irish/Scottish/cockney accent
Seán: Go to sleep *time is 2 am for me* Seán: Go drink some milk Me who doesn't drink milk: *wait what*
Funny thing is Christopher walkens is german, scottish
he should’ve loosely mentioned *DELETED CHANNEL* and how they assaulted thy ears
To be fair to brad pitt he's not playing irish exactly, but a "pykie". In this case I believe he's a pykie of irish decent - not Kale (welsh), or scottish decent travellers/gypsies - in england.
mirr. thats how ive always said it.
Why are these Irish people the equivalent of any Southerner in america
This can be said in America as well, the north and south of America pronounce some things VERY different.
Isn't a good way of getting a accent is to live in that place for a few years?
.....this is too much irish for me
Accents come and go. You have to keep it up or you loose it.  Got a Texas accent 2 years in La will change it.
I remember being in a bar in Hell's Kitchen, NYC, and I could not understand a thing the owner of the bar was saying to me. At the time I thought it was the alcohol or the loud music, but now I'm rethinking that. I'm glad to know that there's Irish accents that even other Irish people have trouble understanding.
No. Not time as in watch. No not watch as in see. No not see as in ocean.
I love this because I do remember years ago, not sure if this is said anymore or not, but I remember when some folks here stateside were saying "you know Sean is just playing up his accent" and I responded with: No, he's making fun of false stereotypes (top o the mornin, etc.) If he was playing up his accent you wouldn't be able to understand him."
That woman who was obviously not irish...can people stop saying british? The lassie was english man, just like Ireland the array of accents across Britain...well 2 whole countries...scotland seems to not even bloody exist eh
Me: *Thinking I can understand all English*  *Watches video*  Also Me: "I cannot understand all English."
Irish accents and Scottish accents are among the best we have in this world!
that was the best reference to hot fuzz, I love Simon Pegg.
2 things, I love Irish accents and also idk ab other ppl but reminding me to like at the end is useful bc I always forget it exists
is i just me but he sounds more irish than usual in this vid
Jack: “did he say I need to have a shite” Whiteboard: “kinda sus”
Alternative title: Jacksepticeye translates his own accent
Love your work seán, from all your irish fans in country cork
You can take the man from the bog, but you can’t take the bog from the man
WHAT THE FUCK JEFF
13:00 "what da fock jeff!  sexiest accent in the world, didntyouseethe strrr rof the video"
You got me at vowel bender 😂
Nothing is as bad as my drunken Norwegian uncle. You have to spend about a week with him just kinda start understanding him.
Every accent in english sounds british in my hears 😅 and I speak more then 2 languages
This video made me laugh so much i cant
What the flare...now I want to listen to Celtic Woman.
I mean if ya listening to irish accents ya have to check out newfie accents, newfoundland for those less acquainted.
I was really hoping you would cover the vid of the old dude from Killarney being interviewed in his local. Straight up the strongest Irish accent I've ever heard. Still great vid!
Down here in clonmel brad would fit in fine
Covid lies watch dr vernon coleman.
The girl from Kerry sounded English totally! Loved this vid, so funny 😂
I had fun too, accents are great.
my god why
Sean is home sick.       PS I'll take me a galway girl.
perk! . . GERDEN!!!
I am part Irish and with some words you can really tell. I mean i don't have a big accent at all. Not even close. I do want a stronger accent but I can't control it at all. I still wish though
Kerry men speak a complete different language to most of us
I want to live in Ireland or England in the future just because it's so pretty, the lgbtq+ laws are better for my protection and the people are lovely there
Don't try to learn Gaelic Irish. You would be lost in figuring out consonant-vowel mutations for the rest of your life.
Aw I can relate 😅 ... I'm Scottish
Sean getting triggered at there bad accents and me just sitting there not knowing what a good Irish accent sounds like.
Now I'm curious what your thoughts are on gaelic and can you do it?
Jack, you should totally look up the Newfoundland accent!!! It's the most eastern province in Canada (a little island) and the accent is unlike anywhere else in Canada, BUT there are a lot of Irish, English and Scottish influences (and some french). I'm a Newfoundlander and there are multiple points in this video where your natural accent sounds like the Newfie one! It'd be cool for you to check out sometime, if you're ever curious about other accents! I wonder how many similarities that you can pick up on!
Well now you have to react to Disney Channel's The Luck of the Irish because..classic.
I just feel like, the thicker the Irish accent, the better they speak Gaelic.
Pleeeeseee for the love of God do another video like this I couldn't stop smiling/laughing !!!! I'm Italian so when I heard the farmer talking I literally thought he was speaking a different language!!! All in all this has been a mistycal experience ahahaha
Jack: Subscribe now! Me: Scrolls down and checks Me: JACK, I am Subscribed already!
Thick Irish accents kind of sound like Jamaican patois at times.  Interesting...
Day 1 of me being a dumb@$$ and asking Jack to play Danganronpa only to get attached to the characters die  right in front of his eyes
Brad Pitt was doing a fucked up gypsy accent as well though. I don’t think it was totally Irish
YOU MEAN THE SLEEP MAN IS SPEAKING *ENGLISH*
Accent but make it   *I r i s h*
And I thought boomhauer was hard to understand
You should look up the Irish pug!
Scottish and Irish do strange things with t's in words. In Irish like Jack says it turns into an sh sound but in Scottish we leave out t's entirely. Only shows up if it's at the begining of words. Scottish becomes sco-ish. And that happens with nearly all words with t's in it. Names included  Only very select words will have it forced. Like the band Metallica will have a t pronounced. But the word metal would not 😂
Add an “een” or “veen” to the end of any place and it sounds Irish
Come to the Deep South and you’ll find the exact same thing, as Southern Ireland.  Accents so thick even your fellow countrymen have a hard time keeping up.  Edit: I can kind of understand what they’re saying is that my Irish roots kicking in?
As a southerner, I also say "mirror" as M-I-RRRRRR...
T be done about it Nottin
Ah the kingdom repping the best accent
Jack, you need to watch Foil, Arms and Hog. And their Irish parodies!
Captions:  A boo boo dragon
You can be fluent in a language, but heavy accents make you feel like you know nothing. hahaha
Is no one going to talk about Sean doing a new York accent?
Jack should listen to sum Irish drill: AC-130, ink
Christopher Walken 's mother was from Ireland...his accent isn't that far off imo.
its 0:41 for me
Aaaaaaaaaahhhhh .
Ok but that translation was impressivvvvvvvvvvve
HELP I ALREADY LIKED AND SUBBED WHAT DO WITH THESE INSTRUCTIONS
On snatch the movie when he asks him for a sausage and he tells him two minutes and then he asks him if they're ready and then he goes 10 minutes Turk and then he says then it wasn't it just 2 minutes 10 minutes ago
im from  Termonfeckin
tried using the auto subtitles... no luck
🇮🇪
The fella for limerick is Blindboy isn’t it!? 😂
As an Irish farmer I can confirm alot of ppl sound like this
What part of Ireland is jack from?
What the fuck Jeff
the Cork accent is the stereotypical irish accent
*Not even Irish gypsy's understand each other*
anyone else hear jack getting a progressively thicker accent as the video went on?
i wanna make fun of it
That lady had the most shite accent ever
I was genuinely impressed when you translated that thick Irish accent. Like how the heck can you understand that
When someone loves you, the way they talk about you is different. You feel safe and comfortable.
whole heartedly agree with irish being the sexiest accent
I'm from Cork and I thought all Irish people said "Arland" instead of Ireland until Séan said Ireland. Now I'm realizing I have a thick accent.
I was born in limerick
Ugc
I'm just amazed at how Jack can understand this guy. Even if he's Irish. It really just goes to show, lol.
Random thing, but the commentary on Love Island Australia is hilarious 😂
i wonder why the UK and Ireland have such varied accent, it's the same in England, every 50 miles the accent changes
English being my second language, I'm slowly losing brain cells trying to understand this and I love it
*Most people:* Mirror.  *Me:* _Mirrrrrrrrrr_
Jack: Every time I do one of these videos I get progressively more Irish.  Me: *Has a flashback to that one Unus Annus video where he went full-%1000 Irish when Ethan tried to insult him*
I had always assumed the joke with Brad Pitt's character in Snatch was that you had no idea what the hell he was supposed to be saying.
I just heard 45 then I started laughing
5:38 when seán said yeah i thought i was listening to lil John
I have to agree with Jack at 12:29 were he says there are a lot of different accents and to just say Irish would be incorrect. I was watching a show and they were doing an American accent and it was honestly more Texas based then where I live and so it didn't sound right but it wasn't necessarily wrong.
Man, that was funny! Do one more please, those accents are great :D
aint gonna lie I have no idea what sheep man said lmao
I loved this so much. There's a video that facts did a few years back where Irish people reacted to Jack and it's another one of my favorites. Would love to see him react to that at some point
You should watch the video of young jack stauber speaking in an Irish accent for a short film he made. It’s called din the life. I would like to see your opinion on it
At 1:05 when the birb comes out imagine Jack’s voice “CawCaw Motherfuckers!”
I met those rowers in real life. I only understand them cause my dad's family all have the same accent
His accent really reared it's head for this one. Exposure done did it.
I was proud I could understand most of these  Then again it’s because I can lip read sooo
Sean: go drink some more milk bitch!   Me: *gets a glass of milk*
I actually thought at times that farmer was just straight up speaking Gaelic
6:00 is like that Hot Fuzz scene when they translate the country farmer, Sean is Danny 😂
Makes me miss Ireland, even though I only lived there one year...
irish farmers are just speaking Swedish
As Jason stathem ones said I fu*king hate pikes
im 11 and i like his jokes
I'm only in four minutes and I've had it paused for about half an hour trying to finish it
what the fook jeff
Leo in Gangs of New York please
So today i learned irish people can say novel length sentences without breathing
"Just put the dog around 'em"
That was so much fun! 🤣 I never realized how awesome Irish accents are!
I think the farmer is saying that there was like moonlight and anyone could've come out for a stroll? Or something? But still..oh the good old days when missing sheep made the news instead of the pandemic.
Oil
i had a combined irish and swedish accent in elementery school because i learnt english through jack and pewds :)
Walken only plays himself
Irish are built strong.
5:22 I'm irish even I can't understand that 😂
Mikey could be speaking Gaelic
Jack but he gets so Irish that he goes into a comma
2:14 because actors are supposed to act as something they are not, otherwise they wouldn’t be actors. Plus, they want to hire the best actors not the best Irish-sounding people. Although I do understand your frustration 😂🤦🏻‍♂️
jacksepticeyereland
That Irish farmer makes me understand how my friends feel when i send them clips of Derry Girls asdfggjkl
Honest question, do Irish people fully understand each other or do they work on context alone?
Im English and this is a bit cringe
8:08 is that... GMAN?
I like being Irish.  Up the Rebels 💀🇮🇪💪
Go to Cheltenham race week in March and you’ll swear your in every part Ireland at once
7:38 we gonna ignore the mad lad had "thigh" in his name?
4:52 Bruh I wish he would’ve saw the video below the one about the sheep guy, I’ve seen it on the ymh podcast and got damn you’d think he was speaking in a ancient language or something
i am from texas and i cant say darling or southern i say Darlin and sotheren because the r sounds different with my accent and i speak very fast i don't speak loud i am rather soft-spoken but i can get loud if i get excited witch makes my accent more noticeable and my s and r sound strange because of my accent compared to people in different states and its strange because my mom doesn't have much of an accent but my grandfather dose and i spent most of my childhood talking to him and my uncles who have a similar accent but my mom is more similar accent wise to my grandmother because she grew up more with her and speaking to her as a child
We need wide-irish
Idk if this happens to anyone else but I'm an American and my accent go from Scottish to southern and sometimes Irish. Idk why. I need help.
We need wide-irish
Not gonna lie the irich man with the hevy accent soded a bit like a accent of norwegian.
Next video you should trying to speak in a American accent
Dublin gang wya? ☘️
WTF.....The cursing is absolutely Hilarious!!
I absolutely love the Hot Fuzz reference lmao
I accidentally watch the first 5 mins in 2x speed and thought jack was doing it on purpose
Listen, I dont have an issue with jacks accent. But my mom can't understand lewis capaldi when he talks and I hear him clear as day so idk what my opinion really means
she's said fleur
Ok, but where is county monaghan? They've just extended Cavan 😂
I swear to Jaysus boi that wen i heard his accent i was rolling on the floor. The man is now an Irish legend  Btw Jack can you make a video talking about Irish language and how we learn it in school
"Irish people are really just built differently" so in other words, Sean's built different. lol
I've not watched snatch for fucking years lol brad pitt does a good gypo he must have done alot of research before hand
Americans probably watch this video with subtitles
Can we get a video of you speaking in a American accent
Holy fuck jack. Are you going grey? How the time flies by lol
imagine getting pinned by jackceptieye
Heavy Irish accent is a language of its own. I'm surprised I caught half of that🤣
I’m not Irish, but my mam is. So I’ve managed to keep up with the stronger of those accents. The saddest thing about my mam having such a great accent is that I arguably have the worst one in the uk, by a long shot. I’m a brummie. 😂
Please jack play Scrutinized it’s a horror game made by Adam
Sean play Scrutinized
Jack play Scrutinized 🥳
I can understand all of this and it's concerning
Notic how he didnt say anything about Australia yha thats right jack im on to you😑
The seemingly only Irish person in that movie is Jamie. Man come on😂😂😂
45 seconds in and I have to say... jack is completely correct I need to drink some milk and go back to bed. I'll get back to this video when I wake up.
I like milk I will drink more milk
Play Scrutinized comments help me please tell jack to play it 😭it’s a horry game made by Adam
Is it weird I can understand the Irish sheep farmer?
At the end of this video i was like "what? that's it? Is it already over?"  I would watch this kind of video all day, Jack reacting on Irish accents! I cannot imagine even one human being not liking Irish language! :)
coming from a French how do u find French accent sexy? (':
FartyFive
These guys really sound like Nords.
surprisingly i did understand the farmer kinda - i mean i am irish but i don't live there so yea...
Long ago the four nations lived together in harmony... but it all changed when the *vowel nation* attacked
"frostbutt"
You’re a litter easier to understand. It might just be that we listen to you all the time
jack: "Try to understand what hes saying." the man: "herginsperginsheepdoneranwawayakekmdmdj"
i think it's time too learn a new language lmao
Sean sounds like a leprechaun on speed
As someone who went to school with people who have Dublin north side accents not all of the accents in Ireland are attractive
Every time people hear my name they are like oh is that Irish? I proudly say yes but this one dude at work literally just says my name in a shitty Irish accent over and over 😂 he’s like KIEGN!!
I think maybe because I grew up in Texas with HEAVILY accented folks, but I was 95% on with all of what they said. ^_^
I only understood the second half of what the farmer said. Jack is good at this
I suck with accents so this is just a "People talk funny" video for me but I'm here for it
I love the fact that he stopped just before Australia, it looks liked he was gonna get in trouble for it or something
speaking enchanting table
I so wish he had watched the Try Channel, just a bunch of Irish people sitting around and talking.
I took my vacation to Limerick. I had fun and not even stabbed once.
sean:get fucked italy!   me,an italian:why sean,why?
Call Me Kevin is from Cork. 😂💗
I think my favorite is Northern Dublin, but maybe just cuz I love Saoirse Ronan.
6:12 sean how the actual fuck
What scares me the most is the fact that I'm fake Irish ( my mum was Irish and I was raised in Poland) and I understand everything without Sean's translation ;_;
Edge is an edge only cut it down cos I couldn't see me view no more what's people moaning about
I remember when Kevin reacted to that sheep video. 😂
brad pitt isn't meant to sound irish in snatch he's meant to sound like a traveller which is very different, idk if he nailed it or not though
Jack’s impression of Christopher Walken was better Than Christopher Walken‘s Irish impression
I'm from the South East of Ireland and I can bearly understand the sheep farmers.
Guess they never met corpse
Everyone who's not irish in 5:32 be like: ?👁️👄👁️?
Brad Pitt plays a traveller tho it’s not really the same 😂
Collab with stg ducky when?
I'm from south us and I can barely speak english I though the farther north the more sophisticated but nope
Im not even irish and im laughing!
When subnautica
Listen to Irish man translate other Irish men.
I just like how I'm both Scottish AND Irish, and yet I have neither accents-
"UGH you're lucky YOU'RE GORGEOUS"
I like how the video at 9:59 has 2.5k dislikes and that it's either a bunch of angry Irish people, a bunch of people who speak it fluently, or both
I'm Scottish and we came third, proud.
lady : do u feel that bending movement carry into the sound Jack : YEAH IM A VOWEL BENDER
6:08 Okay, I'm a noob when in comes to the Irish Accent, but I actually understood this small bit right here...
You sir are nothing more than a Common dandy
Anyone else gonna notice jacks solid Christopher Walkens impression
Frostbut.
I actually watched that ‘how to’ and used to believe that that’s how oirish people do it lol
Wait people can't understand the lad who lost his sleep? I know a good few who have that accent. Even though it is sometimes hard to understand them when they speak Irish.
God it’s 4 in the morning I just got done working out and it hurts cuz I’m dieing of laughter
sheep farmer is speaking blarney
Aha check out Cody Ko’s attempt when he was reviewing your coffee 😭
Funniest thing is I'm 45% Irish and I have a better accent then that...
I do not mean to offend. But how do you understand what he is saying-
frost butt
F A R T Y   F I V E
Honestly, the Irish accent can be understood better than Scottish imo. At least I can place myself in the irishman's story. I have no clue where the scottish person is taking me haha
I understood everything!!
I tried so hard to understand this that I couldn't understand my mother when she told me to clean the dishes
I need Sean and Niall Horan to have a conversation. Idc what's it's about. I  just that specifically.
no Jacksepticeye, you have a more clear accent,`
This was fun.
Had a stroke trying to understand that lovely farmer. Even after jack translated couldn’t piece together what was what
Omg the rubber bandits  (I don’t know if I spelt that right
Someone please tell me why the high schooler in the “frostbit” video looked like a 35 year old dad
guys, losing 50 sheeps isnt a laughing matter.
Irish named sexiest accent in the world  *me who watches nogla terroriser and jack* um excuse me sir
Jack: hmm yeah I get ya Me: the WHAT
Next you should try different accents from all over the world, I really want to see you try an aussie one
Sorry to say this Sean, but actually the Kiwi accent was voted the sexiest...
Every time I watch one of Seáns videos my first reaction is to say “hi pretty blue eyes” cus my little brother has his exact same shade of eye color and I call my brother that all the time...it makes my heart so happy
Sheep farmer was speaking straight simish lmao
the rest of the world: Irish movie Irishmen: THATS NOT IRISH AT ALL!!!!
My dad is originally from Cahersiveen in County Kerry and has been in Australia for 23 years (England before that) and I still have to translate for people or people will look at me for a reaction when he's talking. To the point, it used to bleed into my accent until I was about 19 or so and I used to be mistaken for a foreigner frequently despite being born and raised in Australia. I live out of home in a country town, so needless to say the Australian accent is quite strong where I live and it takes me a moment to be able to understand him again when I visit. You can take the man out of Kerry, but you still won't be able to understand him.
i love it whenever he says fun, lol fon
12:57 Obviously the best accent is such a heavy asian accent that its almost racist
Oh now I wanna see if you could understand the newfie accent!
I'm sorry Jack. We just want accents as cool as yours.
I don’t know why but this made my day
Jackseptoyceye
I’m convinced that farmer is a sim
The fact the the auto-generated captions are even close to accurate amazes me
Jack: watches people who aren’t Irish try the accents Also jack: IT DOESNT SOUND IRISH
To be fair, the first time I heard Colin Ferrel speak in his natural accent, I thought he was faking it.
"Froshbet"
irish farmer talk ain't to different from american farmer talk
I love an Irish accent. Def the most sexy accent. I love hearing the transition from when you first started to now, a proud Irish Lad! You keep being you Seán!
The Irish have an advantage in war because they don’t even have to encrypt their messages 😂
I am Irish and I play with mostly English people  and some Americans and they copy my accent and they do the "feeedle di di" Irish accent even though I sound nothing like that, I play with them every day for the last 2 years and they still think I sound like a leprechaun :(
Me: "what's he saying ?" My subtitles: *Has a stroke*
Love the way ye stop when ye get to the north sectarian heure
Yano....as a person from Cork, I sure hope I that isn't how I sound to everyone😂😂
DUDE!!! COME TO THE MARITIMES IN CANADA!!!  ITS IRELAND ON XAN X
Reminds me of the time Robert Downey jr. Played a welsh man. 🤦🏻‍♀️
Jack: We don’t hang around and run around in fields with our arms out...  Me: *reruns the good ol’ “I Love Nature” video from way back* You were saying..? 😏
Is Jeff Hard or what 😳
I like how Jack put on an Irish accent to copy the farmer conveniently forgetting he HAS an Irish accent. Bless him~
I definitely think you have an advantage if you're used to/understand Jamaican accents. Please do a Jamaican accent video because its so similar to Irish it's ridiculous xD
Snatch was a great movie 😂
That's the rubberbandits aw
farty five i cant xDDDDD
I don't know about Ireland but here in Aus a good Ewe could go for anywhere between $200-$500 a head in auction so I would expect to hear about 45 ewes being stolen in the news
I want to be a citizen of Ireland so bad, I’m an American citizen now but I want to be a citizen of both
9:43 i thought he said glory greatest 😭
''Get f0ked'' xDDDD  i do like scottish one too.
I don't even care what this video was but it had me laughing!
It's funny watching this from Newfoundland and fully understanding the farmers because they sound just like me uncle from up round the bay.
Australian is 5th, wow did not expect that.
Why does Brad Pitt in Snatch look like Colin Farrell in The Gentlemen
That farmer dude sounds like he's speaking norse or icelandic frrr tho, and I'm norwegian
Honestly, the sheep herder had the best accent
Yesss Facts!!
The lad who just lost the sheep is from like west Kerry close enough to me I'd say that was actually fine i understood all of it
The whole video is potato man missing potato land
Sounded like the guy said Frostbutt
Jack what region would you say your accent is from?
I can understand a word here and there enough to get the gist of what’s happening but it’s still confusing af
5:14 the sheep had the trans flag lmao
E
This was so fun to watch. 🤣
He does have a super power! He absorbs all a the Irish!
Irish people speak english in a different laguage
Oil no native English speaker. What Oil understand from the sheep farmer: "kwdjfljflj jkefwefwejfgwö oefipoffefg nothing."
Coldest place in Ireland         BIRR     tis OFFALY cold
Finally a video full of Irish ( btw I’m from Ireland)
19:56 isn't "Stab City" an actual city in GTA V?
Madeline Harvey, the Last Vowel Bender.
i’m not even a proper culchie but the D4 accent makes my blood boil for some reason
THATS an irish SCHOOL BOY??? I am asian and my grandma looks younger than him????
Everyone: "Thicc Irish accents are hard to understand."  American actors: "Hold my Oscar."
Farty five
I like Canadian accent
As we go through each accent, I kind of can identify where the Irish lads are from (Brian, Dahti, etc)
I'm not Irish but I can understand what he's saying a little bit not all of it just a little and he's mad his poor sheep and have a very good day and love the videos
I don’t love nor hate the Irish accent🤔 Scottish accent ftw tho😶
I like how you ended the video just before Northern Ireland lol 😂
That moment you're Irish and this video made you even more Irish sounding
Congratulations you broke the cringeometer
Have you seen sex offenders that's a good irish series
The guy: Frostbite The title: Frostbit The captions: Frosh butt  The video: Cork The captions: Cock is no no we must sensor that [___]
Haven’t watched in a few years, but I’m so glad to come back to this 💕 So much serotonin!
I actually understand the farmer.....I'm from Kerry.....I live there...... I am proud...btw my grandma talks like that
irish people be like "KAM OWN INGERLAND *DUN DUN DUN* SKOAR SOM FAKIN GOULS *DUN DUN DUN*"
A headspace meditation app came on before this.....     and then there was jacksepticeye!!!!!
2:22 *gru is that you?*
Now I just want to play jack videos of people speaking in Irish accents and asking him where they’re from in Ireland
Yes, Jack come back to the big green island.
Imagine the youtuber 'Sir Stevo Timothy' watching these. (Sorry If I got the youtuber's name wrong)
I just realised you have an accent
Thing about the Brad Pitt clip though is that he wasn't doing a conventional Irish accent, he was meant to be a traveller, and he nailed the traveller accent pretty well.
11:15 "Yeah, I'm a vowel bender" LMAO
I was born in  Scotland but only lived there for 3 years I lived in Ireland since am I irish or Scottish
Irish accents are the greatest! 🤣  They're funny, they're sexy, and over all just amazing! My favorite part is hearing Seán swear all the time! Your fantastic Seán! I love your videos so much.
Ahhhh. Now that you "translated" I can hear it, but before it was...like static radio,  in and out - "Well there was a ...real bright....forty five sheep...." Amazing how you hear it clearly once and then you're like "..oh."
What if Charlie (Penguinz0) had an Irish accent? Like, he already has the most bizarre insults and shit, but he'd have an even bigger arsenal if he was raised in the land of insults.
My moms a Newfie and the accent is so strong for some of her family but hers has tamed down over the years. I still meet Irish people with the same accent as her though!
BACK TO THE FUTURE
What I Love about Jack's reaction vids is that you feel like you are watching the vids with him and not watching him react to them.  Much Love Jack
I need more of this ❤️ makes me in such a good mood 😄❤️
listening to the sheep guy gave me such an odd feeling of nostalgia since i grew up in ireland and i could barely understand my grandfather half the time because of his accent...............
3:56 how I feel about Benediction Cumberland's american accent
Whenever i try to do an Irish accent it sounds Scottish
Loved this, as a dub i found this great please do more like this 🇨🇮
I’m pretty sure on snatch, Brad Pitt is trying to speak in a way that you don’t know what he’s saying
“Yeah I’m a vowel bender” 😂
Jack you should watching Irish people try (I think they changed there channel to something else but yeah)
6:47 I swear he said fortnite
My maternal grandfather was Irish, and he passed long before I was born. I’ve always wondered how thick his accent might’ve been.
and i always thaught my german accent would be the sexiest... oh well
12:52 exactly what I was thinking (his reaction)
Omg 0:22 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Im from Austria and we do have also an crazy and strong accent xD and normaly we do understand other Pps from other Citys but then your like "Wtf did you just say? o. o" Like Eichhörnchen Schweif is it normaly called but in Styria (Were iam from) it is called Oarchkatzlschwoaf and everyone just goes like "Are you crazy? You doing alright? Are you drunk buddy?"
Jack knew it was his time to shine
I’m from Newfoundland so I understand
.............. Mollymauk
react to that dublin crack head who's like I'd know i'd know i dont believe in all dem politics and all da also the one with the I LOVE COCAINE
My favorite accent of all time
I count four accents in Dublin alone
I'm Irish we are the best of all countries
That there is an English woman
I actually feel quite proud of myself for understanding most of these. After all, the UK is only a few hours away. Hello from London.
I understand more of the cork accent than the other accents xD
Jack’s reaction to Brad Pritt doing an Irish accent is the same feeling I get whenever I hear Tom Hiddleston do an American accent
5:07 and there you see the beauty of the kerry accent 😂😐 (by the way that's not all irish accents)
Lololol
I've never felt so proud to be Irish
I love the way Jaime Dornan who is from Northern Ireland can't even handle a Republic of Ireland accent lol
Just a “for the record”...Wild Mountain Thyme also stars Jamie Dornan, who IS Irish. So there’s at least one!
Wait y'all ever heard a jamcian accent well my mother has one and the rowing ppl low key sound like that 🤣🍄
11:25  That’s a true Skelliger right there
Weren't the two Rowers on Graham Norton??
Bahahahah but seriously if Seán can't translate I'm scared okay 😔
5:30 Sounds like Norwegian/Icelandic/English mixed together
by different breed i think he means inbred
Im american and watching this high is absolutly amazing
If the t sounds more like sh then does that mean his name is teán?
That smacked to the horse's behind has some girth to it
The third one I understood.
As an Australian I didn’t understand anything ✌️
ow my god I just love Ireland XD
jack: over 42% of you aren't subscribed! what're ya doin? me: ha, what losers didn't sub? i've been subbed for years now! me: *checks anyway* anyway thats the story of how i've been watching jack since i was like 8 but actually never subbed to him double check yr subs childre
My grandad was from Offally, and my God the accent! My mum and I would just smile and nod most of the time,
thats not how you are supposed to wear a mask
*camera zooms in on Jack's puzzled expression*  ... What?
people in America when they do Irish accents they sound like a leprechaun but when the rest of Europe does an American accent they sound like a hillbilly or just pronounce there "er"s like EEEEEEEERRRRRRRRRRRRRR
S P U D
Don’t you just love a good ol’ trip to Oil-land?
God: so how much Irish you want?  Sean: y e s.
Just like an irishman trying to be Christopher walking.... makes no sense😂😂😂
I constantly play the video back and forth between Jack's 'translation' and the original to try to hear them better.
Those rowers sound like they’re talking with their mouths closed
jack you really need to do this again but with a friend so they can compare yours and the accent video
The fact that after Jack translates and after and i can actually understand makes me feel better but also gives anxiety
Wild Mountain Thyme looks like the Irish Tourism Board shite all over again.
The man for the first 2 minutes sounds like German to me. And I learned German for 12 years.
More of this please
I slowly understood
I’m Scottish
When the video started I jumped bc my volume was blasted💔💔😭
Jack: the t sound is always like an sh sound Me: ITS A BACKWARDS LISP
It’s the dance of Ireland HOWOWOW it’s the dance of Ireland HOWOWOW
Anytime the kids from the Ulster Project are in town, if we hang out with them for too long I start picking up their accent by accident. It's terribly infectious and I love it!
Please you have to review Derry girls on netflix, that movie was amazing!! Irish accent had me rolling sometimes
"(Top of the mornin to ya) yeah, Irish people don't say that" I just paused on this SHIT-EATING GRIN! 🤣Like yep, I've perpetuated that stereotype. You're welcome, everyone. I regret NOTHIN.
Music? The irish accent? I'd be more inclined to compare it to dying lyrebird.
so whos gonna tell Kevin that Sean could understand the sheep guys accent
I would watch a thousand of these videos
Killinaskully for the win!  I miss the times living in Kerry....
Saying 1/3rd of every word in a sentence is an Irish farmer’s accent.
"frostbutt*
Most people: *really expensive merch*  Sean: *affordable $12 hot chocolate and $16 coffee*   (I'M ON LAPTOP I CAN'T TYPE THE FADDA OVER THE A DON'T KILL ME)
the point he quoted hotfuzz!! THAT is the reason ım subbed to this dude
I want Seán to watch more Farmer Michael videos. I’m sure he’d die laughing
I love all of em
5:12 I didn't even realize the news reporter was talking in English until now, I just thought it was a whole 'nother language lmao.
I started busting out laughing at 12:43
I don't think Brad Pitt in snatch is a great example since its sort of done on purpose, completely over board because it's funny.
Doesn't the one rower sound like RT/Daniel?
Im irish and i approve this video
Tbh jacks accent is btter
Every other Irishman :I like potatoes   Me: I like mashed potatoes
When I first started watching Jacksepticeye I could tell there was something non-American about his accent. Then he said he was Irish and I was like "oh ok". Years later I found CallMeKevin who's also Irish and it's quite obvious in his accent, and now that I'm comparing the two regarding accents, I'm just so fucking confused as to why I never realized how much Irish Jacksepticeye actually sounds.
Loved this hahah, please do extreme Aussie accents make sure you get a few of the aboriginal lingo in it!
Your voice is way out of sync
this sounds like  a whole different language TwT
The guy from country louth is right on point to what I'd think when I hear the word irish
i just so happend to see Swedish on the list and AHAHAH WHO MADE THAT LIST?? (i am swedish)
Anyone else just watch some of his videos for the accent?
Christopher Walken is from the New York part of Ireland as you can hear by his accent
Yep
dosent say any thing about australia i respect that
Now ya know how Aussie feel when u try and take the piss and mock us 😂😂
Accents are fun all over. It’s just a good laugh tryna do it like
why irish people smilin so  much
10:32 - I just realised I'm one of those distressing souls. I AM SO SORRY, Jack.  Now excuse me as I have to smash that like and subsribe button.
My captions just said it all for me
You should do Dublin these are all culchies
I've never laugh so hard before 🤣
is it weird, that me. a simple dutch guy understands this pretty decent? Maybe helps that i myself have a real thick 'brabants' accent from the south of the Netherlands
If you listen hard enough you can hear jacks voice getting more and more Irish by each video
Lady: "But in an Irish accent, we say _oi."_ Jack: _"I_ don't know if _i'm_ a good barometer(?) for this."
The by that said something about frost bite it sounds like a clip of someone talking in reverse
This is how I feel when someone tries to give off a southern US accent. Most actors use a deep southern accent which does not accurately represent all southerners.
I've been in Northern Ireland almost my entire life so I'm kind of used to it but honestly you can't compare the two (Northern Ireland is its own country)
I NEED more videos of Jack with the accent videos. Oh my gooooood I adored this.
"Whale oil beef hooked" as the Rumjacks will tell you, that's how you do an irish acccent
I learned from father Ted. Drink,Girls,Feck
You should've watched lil becky wants to blow up her school thats a proper accent
19:52 when jack recognises the store spar
Petition to record a video with the irish lads in thicc accents
NZ accent is considered the sexiest, but what evs
I could understand the student and the athletes, but not the farmer lol
Irish lads?
I kept hearing FrostButt
This was fun, I liked it very much. I love Irish accents, wish I could have heard my great grandfather speak. :D (I don't remember where he was from originally, unfortunately) It can never be left to others to decide what an Irish accent is; unless they themselves are Irish. I once had a lady come into my workplace and INSIST I had a "faint" accent. I told her repeatedly it was not so XD.
Disappointed he didn't translate what Irish the Hedgehog was on about.
"every town in Ireland has a completly different accent" lots of England has the same thing. you can cross a bridge of some small towns and encounter a completely different one pending on which side you are.
My father's great grandparents are from Kerry, and I'm not sure how the accent didn't transcend generations because it's so strong lol
Lady: FlOWer hOUr sOUr jack: What is she gonna say 'flier' 'saier' Lady: FLARE
Whoever voted hadn't heard too many Aussie accents then? LOL
Sorry but I have to at my favorite accent is Dutch.
Being from Canada and having an Irish accent my voice tends to change and go Irish now and again especially if I watch videos like your videos or the try channel. Or it just changes naturally itself. I have what I like to call a "chameleon accent" where it changes and mimics what accent I tend to hear alot. But Irish, being my strong one, comes out alot. So whenever I am out and around public before this whole scrap of mess called Covid came about, it always is amusing to be asked "oh how long have you lived here" or "where you're from" or "which part of Ireland you came from" and it's just funny to see their reaction when I tell them I am born and raised here in Canada. Irish is my strong suit as I can't get Scottish for nothing, even when I try I either just sound Irish or like a knock off Shrek
😂 I’m a VOWEL BENDER lol
i need u to watch derry girls. i really need to know what u think of it.
hey sean♡♡ a really GOOD irish accent would be norman reedus in the boondock saints!!
new zealand was voated the most sexy in the world multiple times
Hehe yours
Don't worry, I'm having fun listening to all these:D
6:56 Tom hanks?
Same with Scotland
I loved this video so much please do more hahah
I kept thinking how I wouldn't be able to understand the farmers accent even if I was Irish
Noooo his hair is getting grey streaks! HES GETTING OLD! Where have I been?!
Me dad is Irish and I got his accent and I can understand most Irish accents but the mad sheep farmer was so difficult to hear and understand XD
Jaysus lads theyre makin a mockery of us so they are. If ya want to learn an irish accent watch father ted for feck's sake. Pog mo thoin americans 😎😘
Full American born and raised in Ireland tho
Thats what we hear in America
I’m sorry but the Cork accent really is the hardest accent to decipher, my cousins will speak to me for a straight 5 minutes and the only thing I would pickup from what they’d said would be “like”
What the feck I'm Australian and I never understood I'm sure Americans just love to be racist I'm not attacking them just how do you not understand Irish accent??? Most Australia do it for fun fuck is wrong with you merica
The last vowel bender 🤣🤣 I mudpied my underpant
I can't believe that movies don't just cast irish people for an irish accent... like how hard is that? XD
10:43 níl sin ceart
My g-g-grandfather was an immigrant from Cork. I never met him, he died before I was born. I suppose he talked like those Olympian fellows!
Brad Pitt had some good accent 😆
North Dublin accent wasn't North Dublin. Kerry accent is nowhere near from kerry. All dub fine gael sounding accents
I feel like Cork may be Ireland's version of Texas
Fun fact the irish tend to have dark hair and blue eyes. And guess what I have dark hair and blue eyes and I'm part irish. Now I am truely closer to the jacksepticeye. Only part though I'm american
I guess this is what english sounds like to people that don't speak it
Growing up Jamaican.... I used to be very confused at why people said some of the different Jamaican accents sounded Irish. .... I am no longer confused lmao. I love this video
My friend can do one but for only one phrase...  AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH  It eludes me how she does it.
Is this what enchantment table sounds like?
Jack I love ur videos and ur videos make me happy and I am depressed so my therapist says that it is good that I have one thing that makes me happy so thank you Sean 😁😁😁
You and kevin should do this together and react lol
Where does Mike Myers as Shrek fall in the mix? (Or was that a Scottish accent, I’m honestly not sure. 🤔)
This makes me want to live in Ireland more
Me during the ads: ok gotta grab Google tranlate
How would you rate Sean Connery in Disney’s Darby O’Gill And The Little People? I know Sean Connery is primarily Scottish, but I heard he was partially Irish. In the movie, his character is specifically stated to have been from Dublin. I actually did watch it with a co-worker from that region once! He liked it.
It’s crazy how cork has such strong accents but Kevin doesn’t lol
wtf sean that's actually a really good Christopher walken
Omg Hot Fuzz is my favorite movie. And my brother's.  "No luck catching them killers then?"
Boys I haven't a clue wa ur man from Jerry's sayin til Sean translates it like fuckinnn helllll didn't know people here has accents that mad
FARTY FIVE HA!
I was about to freak out once I heard the british in her accent I was like who do you think yer fooling? And my roommate calmed me down after that for sure, I'm based in northern dublin btw
5:31 that’s is NOT English, no fucking way.
Sean pretty much sounds American with slight brittish and irish undertones now. 😂
I feel like ive learned how to translate a mad Irish accent
HE PAUSED THE VID WHILE THEY WERE TALKIBG ABUT THE SOUTHERN PART AND I DIDNT KNOW HE PAUSED IT
mate actually the fucking rating was rigged, Scotland is forever. i should know.
I'm partially Irish on both sides of my family, but I cannot and will not do an Irish accent because I would just embarrass tf out of myself and anyone within hearing distance
Its wired when I hear someone that can't speak Irish right
I have spent a lot of time down in the south of Ireland with people who have very thick accents and  I'm  surprised I could understand 80% of what was being said there. Good on me, proud of myself.
"All done in good crack "
Sadly the Facts Channel ended but the people from it started a new channel called the Try Channel
I love Irish accents
Me watching the video as non fluent English speakers: *_confused 100_*
I was actually SHOCKED when he was able to translate what that guy was saying. It still sounds like a foreign language to me.
the irish accent kind of just sounds like another language if you’re not used to it tbh. i’ve grown up around irish people so i have somewhat an understanding but people with HEAVY accents i just can’t understand fast enough 😂
drink some more milk bitch* this i will quote forever
So many of those accents from the vid w the man and the woman sat listening were very mild in my opinion! I have some dozens of hours of practice listening to irish accents just this year though, i suppose, between Sean and Raniel Taniel, but I have auditory processing problems to counterbalance that lol
septiceye the last vowel bender no okay?
Watching this video, made me realize how much Irish immigrants influenced my accident. Didnt realize the melt pot also meant accidents
I was hoping you'd go over The Boondock saints in this. Also New Zealand and Irish Accents are the sexiest for me, difficult to pick between the two. I feel bad for Gerard Butlers fail at Irish accent, he's Scottish of course he'd not do it right. That'd be like getting Jason Stathem to do one.
0:55 he says herb with an h and I love it
Wild mountain thyme -or- fifty shades of Ireland. I'll be leaving now. But seriously just CAST IRISH PEOPLE FOR IRISH ROLES give the little actors a chance
How was Italy sexier than scotland
As an American.....I have to close my eyes and listen and then I can get most of it other than some words from the first sheep herder
Love your accent! ❤
I think that lady giving the lessons spent too much time in South Boston. Because that was mostly a Southie accent she was putting on.
Hearing people try to do my Northern Irish accent while I’m living abroad is honestly the most painful yet entertaining thing imaginable
5:10 is the Irish equivalent of Boomhauer 😂😂😂
why is no one talking about christian grey doing an irish accent i'm dying
From the title alone all I can think about is 2 men 200 accents
imagine laughing without understanding anything
Honestly I'm from Ireland (Wexford) and I cant even translate that farmer!
my old maths teacher was from kerry and i was the only person who understood him lol
Thank you for translating.
frost BUT
seans ability to translate the farmer makes me ashamed of kevins measly attempt
Hey man, a dublin man living in New Zealand here and I've recently gotten back into watching your videos and the way you talk about ireland and the craic/culture we have really makes me miss home.  I absolutely love it man, it's like having a piece of home on the internet watching you... keep it up you absolute soggy piece of toast ☺
cork accents sound like the scourcers in england
I personally like southside Dublin accent myself.
The picture of the guy with a spar bag on his head is blindboy from limerick, aka the rubberbandits check out his podcast, u wont be disappointed
You don't sound at all like an Irish even when you try!
Lmao my ancestors are from Cork so I'm sure I wouldn't have understood them at all 🤣🤣
"The sexiest accent is Irish."  Me, who watched two Gaelforce videos: O_O wait what
Fuck sake sir you didn’t do a Donegal accent and then your man was just about to do one then you ended the fukin video
Yours is the best accent uwu
English is not even my first language I would love to have some sort of accent that ppl like lol
i hate when people call british people english, we rnt the same
I can't believe he didn't acknowledge the fact that Irish accent was so much higher on the list than Swedish accent.
Oh nothing is wrong with how Sean sounds...its just "SEXY", ...just...stay sexy Sean.. stay sexy.
I hate gettin' frost butt...
Jack, the illustration of the guy with a spar bag on his head @ 19:56 is supposed to be one of the rubberbandits because thats where they are from
I tapped my phone and you paused the video so i thought i paused the video 😂
when i tell you I LAUGHED OUT LOUD XD
when ur from kerry and thats how ur whole family talks
Its practically a different language
*video of an irish man getting happy because he is doing great in an irish speaking tutorial*
Don’t they say that an Aussie accent makes a lady’s knickers fly off?  **cough**
I’m Irish ☘️ lol just found out
the thing is they don't need real Irish it has the same effect on non Irish people anyway
Jack react to funny scottish people
Call me kevin sent me here
Guy: Oi Theb eya duil mune uuut seou eaneboe cu do teketh e   Sean: “there was a full moon out so anybody could’ve taken them.”
Scotland gang where by comrads at
Amazing!😂🙏🏼
Once he translated a bit i could half understand
Omg, I so get that. I grew up in southeast America, and a lot of people down here have super thick accents. My grandpa talks in a heavy southern accent and only my mom and aunts can understand him. It's like a whole other language.
Part 2 Nadine Coyle
Skibbereen waheyyy
i'm irish and have no clue what he was saying 😂
*fleer*
5 days later still processing how did jack understand the farmer
Can I have your coffee
i remember at my aunties house in cork she used to have a old man live behind her and he sounded so much like that sheep farmer, and guess what he was also a sheep farmer haha
where is the "top of the morning gelatis"
Part 2 pleaseeeeee
The Limerick guy was, I think, the main fella from the Rubberbandits - he wore a bag on his head in one of their song videos.
Idk some words the farmer said kinda sounds like Daithi De Nogla
I noticed that when the guide to Irish accents person was imitating the peoples republic of cork; it sounded a lot like Terrorizer, one of Jacks' Irish lads lmao. Pretty much sounded spot on to him!
I want to speak with a legitimate Irish accent and speak the Irish language, but I just can't do it.
“Go drink some more milk, bitch” Me, 15, who just had my first shot of whiskey:
Gypsy accents are definitely different to Irish accents though... haha
See, I think NS Dublin is the sexy sounding one. But having listened to this variety, in my head, when I think Irish accents, I think Dublin. Either North or South.  I had no trouble understanding Brad Pitt in "Snatch." I thought that he was supposed to be some kind of Scottish though, lol.  All accents are awesome. They are a bit of home for someone.  BTW you forgot to include the clip of Colin Farrell reciting the Lucky Charms list on Scrubs.
That boy said “frushbutt”
You saying your accent got stronger because this video cracks me up because your accent is always like this you’re just paying attention to it more because this video lol
Everyone thinks I'm nuts for thinking its sexy ....guess what I dont care it's my fantasy to have "have a funtime" with a man with the Irish accent  oh yea lol I'm serious
It's not Irish it picky
Get effed Italy needs to be merch.
I think the best accent was Seans
You know what clip would have been great for this video Jack? :D "When Irish People Can't Speak Irish" by the Irish sketch comedy group Foil Arms and Hog :p
Irish people are great! XD
19:52 The guy with the Spar bag on his face is from the Irish comedic duo Rubberbandits! :D
I was listening to a quiet video before this and then got smacked in the ears by Shaun
I mean ur not the only one   Even in japan they have like a whole dialect of Japanese that most of the city folks in japan don’t understand    I think it was from countryside or way north of japan that they have that dialect
Alright, where’s Mike? Mr. That Chapter! Get over here with your “trees”!
News in America be like: "Biden won againsed trump." News in Ireland: "my sheep's gone missing"
If Irish people don't say top of the morning why did you say it a lot and name your coffee company that?
Man you forgot Boondock Saints the father is hard to understand sometimes
"Oh kiss me arss, tell me you like my hat?!" That had me rolling on the floor 🤣😂😂
Yes you watch Simon pegg and nick frost movies!!!! I dont know anyone else who does becos dey all chavs and modern maet
Tbh they sound like drunk Americans 😂😂
this is hilarious
I want to be interested in Irish, but the Irish curriculum (language) only teaches you stuff you'll never use. like: "Cad a raimh Seán ag dheanamh san leithreas na gcailíní?"
am i the only one that was yelling about jamie dornan being irish in the first movie
Up here in donegal we say aye as in yes
“Eat shit, FRANCE!”
All the Irish accents ya went through and never mentioned the west me I was waitin for a roadie accent
I tried doing an Irish accent and it just turned into a British accent XD
Im from somerset but moved to yorkshire years ago, my uncle has a cow farm somerset and has the strongest farmer accent it really does sound like that guy from hotfuzz 😂
The Irish farmer reminds me of the guy with a really strong Australian accent I think (idk exactly where it’s from but it’s very thick) and lightning struck near him n someone else and it was so funny
"everyone in cork seems to talk a few octaves higher!" (everyone looks at CallMeKevin)
What the FUCK Jeff
what about Orson Welles' absolutely desgustang irish accent in Lady From Shanghai
react to the celtic carnyx
Growing up in northern minnesota, there are still ill a few pockets of people that have thick accents halfway between scandi and stereotypical Minnesotan, and growing up around it, it was still hard to understand them sometimes, you really had to focus on what they said.
jack is like my english teacher translating all the shakespeare words in macbeth
Sean translating that Irish accent is one of the most impressive things I’ve ever seen
I’ll never have a good Irish accident as an American, but by golly I feel Irish
Good to know my school decided to take us to Stab City last of basically touring all of fucking Ireland in a week... it honestly sucked but im gonna come back next year if i can... without school
The irish farmer sounds like me having a stroke trying to do an accent
There's a Graham Norton interview with the Irish rowing team that fried my American brain.
Where is Jack from?
its sad that his christopher walken accent is better than christopher walken trying to sound irish
And the Kerry accent is similar to Doric in Scots.
Why dont they hire people that actually represent the roles ;-;
“Oh, ye woodn be long gettin frostbit!”
“I just say the words that way anyway” yes jack because you have an Irish accent
Me knowing I’m not Irish: 😔 Me knowing a share being an Aquarius with Jacksepticeye: 🤩
i can do a so-so irish accent. Not like my mom, who somehow manages to do an Indian accent when trying to do Irish.  Holy fuck these are some thick accents
I was thinking about that scene in hot fuzz through all of this
I'm a Geordie and I speak fast & mumble and people always think I'm Irish. Dunno what this information means but yeah
I enjoyed this so much!
It's like listening to a language I hardly speak, pick out a few phrases you know and you get the general idea but I'll be damned if I try and figure out all the other stuff he's saying
16:07 hes too smart to be left alive
Jack, you use light theme that's good but have you used the theater mode It's fucking awesome my brother.
I understood most of what the heavy accented farmer said
After he translated that first sentence I could suddenly understand his accent MUCH better the rest of the way
Irish the Hedgehog
“Eat sh*t France” this will always be remembered lol
Subtitles can't keep up very well, quite entertaining to watch
jack: talking about how not many people say the ill sound jack a minute later: iurland
when im tired i talk so fast I apparently sound like the farmer
Got a dirty bean juice ad while watching this.
Like and reply if ur irish
Jack should act in WILD MOUNTAIN THYME, now thats a movie worth watching a 100 times.
those farmers are like speaking another language to me my brain hurts
Wow... He could understand him...
Wild Mountain Thyme honestly sounds more Scottish to me 😂
@15:16 that guy circling her like a predator was pretty odd. I laughed so much at the heavy accents part. :D I had just said "That girl from Kerry sounds more English than Irish to me" (an English person) and then Sean said "She sounds British" and I nearly had a fit. British people don't have one accent, Sean, you know this!! Britain is England, Scotland and Wales, ffs, all very different accents from each other, even if you only go with the accents in their capitals. Arrrggghhh.
if that sheep farmer tried talking to me I’d just feel so bad because I got literally nothing from that.
By the end of the video, Sean's accent sounded so mild comparatively! 😂
I can kind of understand the guy with the shed full of weapons and the "sea moine" in Hot Fuzz, if I listen closely. I can understand the old man on the police force in Hot Fuzz pretty good. That farmer with the sheep? I got nothin'.
Lol, I feel like they should've just casted people with an actual Irish accent.
I heard your getting canceled for saying “imagine not having a PS5” oh for fucks sake it was a joke they gotta calm down😶it clearly was a joke
Jack starting to look like he teach yoga in New York. Or writing a woke story at naughty dog
My grandma has a really strong Irish a accent
Where did Jack move to? I thought he still lived in Ireland.
You sounded better doing Christopher Walken with an Irish accent than he did.  Brad Pitt was playing a Gypsy and it was pretty damn good.
Where exactly is the line between accent and stroke?
I live in Suffolk in England and some of our old Suffolk boys have pretty strong accents too. All our local police post on Instagram is when they've met a cute dog while out working or seen some geese. Country life really is a league of its own xD
2:21 best arnold impression i've ever heard
How to do an Irish accent: fleur
*Manbun*
Rest of the World: "what about this plague?" Ireland: "whatn boutn te shapesnalambsnaewesgoh'n messin?"
Apparently, Brad Pitt's accent was pretty spot on. He was playing an Irish traveler, whose accents sometimes sound very much like his did, only his was exaggerated. Of course, anyone who isn't Irish doing an Irish accent of any kind is more than likely going to fail at it, but as far as Pitt goes, he didn't fail as hard as others.
0:33 *It'll Get The Blood Flaw!!*
Hahah I’m Irish, I agree jack, it’s hilarious. Nobody can pronounce it as well. And the heavy Dublin accent is hilarious
Brad Pitt was playing some one from the travelling community so in that respect it’s a brilliant accent.
I find it refreshing that we don't hear people cry foul about cultural misappropriation due to this. I don't understand why anyone would speak out against people flattering them by copying what they do. Allowing mockery is good PR. He aught to have gotten drunk for a proper attempt 😉🤣
Talk Irish to me baby 😂
It’s so funny that I understand the old man that has lost his sheep. Well that’s what I get for living in Kerry
Anyone else think that sheep farmer looks like the wendigo hunter from until dawn
Fun fact. The jamaican accent was heavily influenced by Irish. Especially clear when you listen to those rowers from Cork! Look it up if you don't believe me!
Some of these fuckin HURT
I love accents. Anything besides the American accents. I'm American and I hate them lol. I grew up in the midwest "buddeR" "leddeR". I hate it.
I feel like the only word I understood from the sheep farmers was sheep
The only reason why I, a dutch person, knows what they're saying is because of this thing called cito
Frostbit kids accent sounds a lot like a Minnesota accent. you betcha.
I see you skipped over the 5th vote there   Good man 👍
When You understand the farmer but not jack...
I like to see jack doing an Among Us video but he's doing the Irish accent the whole time
MOIY NAYME IS SHAIY PATRECCKK CORRMAUCK - Assassin’s Creed Fans know what I’m on about 😂
Irish accents only sound good when the person is actually Irish
The Mad Accent’s the Irish version of gummy Creole
"Ah you're lucky you're gorgeous!" ~Sean 2020
sean: it’s just cringey  also sean: wearing a tshirt with top of the morning on it
Never heard a scouse (Liverpool) Irishman
brad pitt plays a dodgy guy with a purposely hard to understand accent so people fail to understand him
Me realising that my name is also *ROSEMARIE* : 👁️👄👁️
The video: say ' top of the morning ' Jack: *doesn't advertise his top of the morning coffee with the shirt he's wearing* The video: you're like a coffee, hot, sweet, and you make me jumpy Jack: *DOESN'T ADVERTISE HIS TOP OF THE MORNING COFFEE WITH THE SHIRT HE'S WEARING*
React to 2020 sexiest language!
I heard Electra
I have relations in Kerry and it took me years to understand them, it sounds nothing like us in wexford
Brad pitt: *hungover noises* Jack: "THATS a good Irish accent!"
I want to go to Ireland to pretend I picked up a heavy accent and mess with people.
Omg Brad pit in snatch was the funniest thing, I love how eventually they got everything they wanted 😄😂
Swedish at 7th place😌💅
Yup British people love swearing you can't judge us but our favourite swear words are f, a, d and s and we love drinking beer
Yiddish is also sexy!
Irish is like the English version of Netherlands Fries, I speak the same language but even I don't understand
The fact that I knew Sean's accent (the farmer wi' the missing sheep) is fucking wild to me seeing as I'm fae Scotland nae Ireland, but then I remember... I'm in Doric land.
HAH you think irish is bad, try welsh!
Yeah Brad Pitt tried to speak Jamaican Patois once in a movie. It wasn't that good.
I'm English and I can understand it
I have a Northern Irish accent and jesus christ people up here forget that syllables exist half the time
I mean it is LITERALLY the scene in Hot Fuzz, Sean. It’s not close, it’s EXACTLY that scene
it’s like a mix between north us/canada and england
When the guy talk at about 9:35 I though "Thats not too hard to understand." And then I renbered taht my Uncle lives un Skibbereen and I've visited hin and ny Aunt every year for my entiee life and taht probably tge reason I have no toubke understanding them.
You insulted me when u said drink more milk. I literally drank a gallon of milk this night
You should hear a Newfie accent. First time I heard it I thought they were Irish.
i'm half irish and the One Thing i can say in a perfect irish accent is "Did you hear who died?"
I think you did a better Chistopher Walken impression than he did an impression of an Irish accent.
Boi Ballehaunis is in Mayo aha! Swhere were from!
The best Irish accent: Mirrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
Brian aka Terroriser has the most understandable accent.
I actually have family in Kerry, specifically Killarney, and some of their neighbors there talk like that. I’m American so it straight up pains my soul when I hear their neighbors talk
Me: *Watching this in the corner of my room* Sister: *Walks in* Me: *Trying not to laugh*
🤣 vowelBender
if you play this in 0.25 speed it sounds like hes drunk
Up the Athlone accent
If I weren’t already a new sub, this video would’ve made me.  So entertaining! 😂  As to which Irish accent is the best:  they all are. 😊
Oh how I miss Ireland! Lived in Dublin for over a year 😍
Starts: fuck you italy! Me: an Italian from Rome 👁️👄👁️
It’s impossible to say Ireland without a Irish accent
This is why my countrymen stopped trying to conquer Ireland...we got far too confused with their accents and thought fuck it were off home.
the part of Ireland i come from an Irish coffee is 2 percent coffee and 98 percent Irish whiskey
I could listen to Colin Farrell talk for hours.
My mother's from Donegal, my father from Kilkenny but they met and married in Rosommon,  I married a Galway man, my accent is very much  unplaceable.
who else lives in ireland
American  vocal coach's haven't a clue, God help her she is hilarious
Can someone PLEASE tell me they too don’t see the difference in accents,  Of a Scottish man where to talk to me, then an English man, I’d hear no difference in their talk,   I literally didn’t know my classma had a british accent for 5 years until a teacher mentioned it, even then I hear no difference
“Irish is the sexiest language in the world” Me with an Irish Siri: 👁👄👁
Ash framed furniture on point.
Make some more videos on this, like this!
Wow the Australia accent has been voted the fifth sexiest accent? I have mixed feelings lol.
To be honest, if I may, when I subscribed years ago it was because of your accent xD and of course your personality! Love you! XD
To be fair people shouldn't think these accents are normal here lol they're outliers isolated regions and alot of these people are old as the hills with no teeth especially the farmer and the old man in the pub who probably have Alzheimer's. You're just as likely to find crazy accents in the U.S., Australia or England as you are in Ireland.
I am do only one or when ever the man talks he sounds german
did anyone else thought that the title said bad british accents?
10:30  *scrolls down *nods in subscription pride
LIKE A BOSS!
all of a sudden this makes "Und hungr'y hogg" look like textbook English.
Ya I do here Irish people say "Ireland" "Oireland" LoL
I can understand where your coming from. It's like in NZ people have voiced to me that they can't understand the accent of local moari's/New Zealanders. But since I'm used to the accent and slang its second nature.  But I could understand what they were saying after a short while of listening to them talk. Perhaps because I'm part Irish and Scottish, in my family tree that is. Idk
"farty five" trap musician?
me a latin american that doesn't even speak english in a regular basis watching this video 👁️👄👁️
That movie is going to be the top movie of 2021 because of your promotion!
Oh God this is reminding me of the time I spent 2 years in Scotland for boarding school and I literally spent several months not understanding what the hell my history teacher was saying....
Jack's accent is definitely the sexist haha
I'm dying we do not speak like the girl saying how to speak in an Irish accent
I love this!  I love your accent!  And I love that you interviewed Matthew Mercer!!!  That's what I'll be watching next!  XOX
Come home to ireland jack 🥰🇮🇪
I’m English & in my early 20s I moved to Killarney in Kerry, at first the accent baffled me, but eventually got used to it. I thought I’d forget, but I understood every word that farmer said, it made me kind of homesick for Kerry, it’s a beautiful place, I really miss it.
What about Northern Irish...😑😆
00:40  Jack: "Go back to bed child, start drinking more milk BITCH!"  Me: 20 years old....in bed at 3 am....watching youtube.....drinking milk...... "whelp...."
That guy with the bag in his head is in a band called the rubberbandits.  Look it up  Edit: im irish btw
I  make fun of myself even if I 'm not an irish
Irish accent isn't that sexy.  Girl whispering :"Do you want to plant your potato in my soil"  Oh boy
I’m from Ireland and I can’t even understand em.
I find them not that bad.... But I'm also Canadian so that's low-level cheating cause.... Newfies. If you can understand a Newfie you can understand a lot of things.
UP THE KINGDOM!!!! (The how to do an Irish accent is definitely a donegal accent)
my country is in the top five YES      i don't have the accent though
I went to the same college as jack. We weren't in the same classes but I saw him around the campus
aight... imma need a series
I'm wondering..has Seán ever tried to  speak like an 'american' like without the Irish accent. XD
he’s so chaotic i love it
Constantly teasing everyone is apparently a psychologically characteristic trait of Irish people esp men so the craic ur missing is in ur dang blood Jack 😂
8:26 thats northern but im northern irish and can confirm we are also built different especially with our accent xD
I’m from Waterford and all I could translate was mountains
Buddy wait till u hear the Indian accent its the same as Irish thick and strong🤣🤣😂😂 Cuz am an Indian and I know how it is 😂😂
00:27  Did you just tell me to eat shit, Sean?
YouTube: "This video offers subtitles" Me: Thank god.
Irish people dont "oi" instead of "i" , i know because im irish myself
When I search the sexiest accents in world I get New Zealand, South African and then Irish🙈
U lucky u didn't insult australia
Irish and Scottish are exactly the same and you can't convince me otherwise.
the only thing i can say is 45 because my friend said it in one and we copied him lol
wild mountain thyme comes out in cinema Irish people watching: posh laughing
Can we have the Irish Boys back Jack?
Ok I an Irish but I don't have an Irish accent because I live in America but for some reason out of the blue I get an Irish accent
I'd love to see your opinion on the movie "Boondocks Saints"
As an Australian I just want to say why the hell are top 5 on the sexiest accents
I can't understand everything the sheep farmer was saying, but it was possible to understand most of the words the first time.
this is why I'm glad I don't have a thick accent since no one would understand me
I DON'T CARE  Girl from the movie thing
if milk is good for your bones, why haven't I gotten a huge gongus
Americans playing Irish people in films, reminds me when the obviously not Brummies in Peaky blinders tried to do the birmingham accent😑😂
For the farmer, I closed my eyes and when he started on about the sheep, I caught most of it! I'm an Irish Farmer Whisperer!
How did South African not win? Séan calls me a bitch. Ah.
Nothing compared to my cousin Lonnie in the hills of Breathhitt County Kentucky.
"i wanna see if yall can understand it" ha, i have issues processing words anyway, i was doomed to begin with
I really hop o don't get froshbit this winter.
2:20 jack turns into gru
The brogue is strong with that farmer. The ol' O'shea boi!
5:33 you see what he said was
Stopped short of calling out Australia as the 5th Sexiest Accent, eh?
I'm Irish and I can say those accents can only bee seen in at Dublin football arenas 😂
Fleur is French for flower not Irish.
* Irish man watching a video about learning the Irish accent * "I'm fukin, I'm great at this!"
If sèan says the “t” is like a “sh” the shit would be “shish”
I’m pale, am more than 50% Irish, *but don’t have the accent*
He should have watched the Killarney clip
I... I dont understand the Accent is to hard to understand my brain hurts
my accent is the fifth sexiest...? huh. WELL SHIT. ASMR CHANNEL HERE I COME- im kidding i hate my own accent with a burning passion because i hate m e
That was freaking awesome to watch and I love these little glimpses into Irishness😂  Also I wonder if he has seen Billy Elliot, I watched it recently and the accents are cool
1:12 has to be Cindy from The Grinch
The longer I watch, the more I understand what they’re saying
*jacksepticeye intensifies*
this man sounds like hes Japanese hahahha
This video showed up on my recommendations while I was watching an AMSR video.... YouTube you okay?

So the Irish News doesn't talk about Sinn Fein

0:28  Jack: *doesn’t insult the Aussie accent*  Me: *sǝsıou ssǝuıddɐɥ*
I'm a bit Irish and I could understand some of what the guy was saying on the sheep vid like that was a mad Irish
3:30 Pikey is not irish.
Takes one to know one
I've honestly seen worse in the UK lol
Jack you don't Evan have that much of an accent
Gaelforce brought me here and omg this was hilarious 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
When did Jack stop doing his intro???
“He had a riock tieed to hes neack” -Gru 2020
Turn on YT subtitles haha
as an irish man me self i can confirm this is a very heavy accent and i can bearly understand it
Who wants to hear Sean speak a clean American accent
"Start drinking more milk bitch"  ~Jacksepticeye
I can usually understand difficult accents     But good lord is that difficult
is that Jamie Dornan playing an Irish character
I'm Scottish
Ey boi can oir borrur some flurr sorry working on my irish accent thanks to this vocal coach lol
I can't understand irish accents
I'm American and I've been to Ireland once...why can I understand most of the really thick accents hahaha
"start drinking more milk bitch" literally made me cry thats the best insult
Jacksepticeye should learn the actually Irish language if he doesn't already
Omg this is amazing
Fuck I’m Scottish
That was fuckin hillarious to listen too
I went to Ireland for a few weeks. A few days there I unconsciously start talking in an accent. Someone in Belfast thought I was from Ireland. All the way to Dublin people think I'm Irish (I mean, blood-wise... yeah, partly). Go home....................... "that accent's so fake man." Apparently, Americans can tell fake Irish accents better than Irish people lol
The first time I heard Julia Robert's do an Irish accent was in the Michael Collins movie and jesus christ  our whole class wished for her character to be shot in every scene she was in to end the torment of that shite. Leave the Irish accents to us from the island, ta
Awwww Sean how did u not recognize the rubber bandits,  also did u go to U.L or L.I.T just curiosity
He's seeking german
Idk why I’m very impressed and very confused how he understands what that guy was saying
@jacksepticeye Seán, I'd love to hear your opinion on Hozier's accent!!
My fav accent would be Jack copying christopher walkin.  Great accents Ireland!!
he says they don't say top of the mornin...then whyyy did he name his coffee top of the morningg
It almost sounded like they said farty five when talking about the sheep 😂
Irish also has dialects so in Snatch it's obviously a specific dialect and way of talking the character has. It happens for real too. I do love an Irish accent but I love Scottish more.
Irish accent is definitely serious drunk or pitchy drunk..... it is tooo much
Irish might be the sexiest accent but what’s the sexiest language
Is it bad that I'm proud that I could understand most that?
im American, and yet at 19:09, i absolutely laughed my ass off.
Yay I love snatch
That frostbit video is such a throwback
Farty Five 😐..................😂
Hecking love Irish accents I wish ik someone irl who has one
English has it's spelling issues, but so does Irish Gaelic: Maith = "good", pronounced "ma" Taoiseach = "Prime minister", pronounced "tee-shukh" Aghaidh = "face", pronounced "aye"
i think you meant THICCCCC irish accent
Me during this entire video: Do you want to say that again? Maybe in English this time?
I've been working with a girl for the last year that just moved to Canada from Ireland, and the amount of times we've had to say "what?" to each other at first because of our accents differences is hilarious. but we've got each other figured out now
The Cork rowers weren't too hard to understand.  But those farmers, whew, that was a new one.
5:31 That's not an accent. My mans has just created a whole new language.  Edit: 8:08 He knows it too
you added snatch😂
At this point Jack should consider himself bilingual
I saw Callmekevin react to the sheep video and he was laughing because he couldn't understand the farmer at all lol
You know the accents bad when the subtitles say [ music ] 😬
Honestly, the entire reason why I watch you is because I absolutely can't understand hardly anything you say. It's great.
It was rigged the Irish people control the media us Italians clearly won
So funny that those rowers were commenting about how they will have no problem with the drug test (pee in a cup) because they've had plenty of water... LOOL
Being from Yorkshire. I couldn’t understand a fecking word of the farmer said.
Lucky you didn't say Australia as well at the start
"Haha eat shit France"
I love how we skipped northern ireland
oh bro dont even worry we kiwis are a different breed too
Jack wheres the blackrock accent
Ok now I want Sean to do a Texas, California, and New York accent. And, go!
I understood brad pit but this... I feel like I had a stroke if not Jack translating it and me undertanding him...
Ok but it's the lack of Boondock saints for me
Reminds me so much of sønderjysk xD
Us Irish don't have to say where in Ireland we're from. We just pick it up from your accent.
To this day, my favorite Irish phrase is "Come 'ere ta' me." XD
I was really hoping that he’d have Jin from Yu Yu Hakusho in this lol
I’m from Kerry and nearly everyone one that’s about 50 or older talk like that 😂😂
My boyfriend has a thicm accent but these take the cake!!!!
Mad respect for the hot fuzz quote and remembering the translation
Y
i loved irland accent and i understand it better than  neglish wow i have to move there
Ah yes, irish. The drunk leper's language.
Its  funny but i got the jokes and i am bulgarian we are interested in every culture and in our aswell :d
7:45 is what you sounded like with green hair
My family came from Cork, Laois, and Tír Eoghain over to Virginia and Kentucky some 200 years ago
So I’m 50% Irish and I love Irish accents so if you could just do this all day I would totally sit and watch forever.
seans getting greys
Honestly, we don't have it as bad as you guys with irish accents, but we have had some shocking Welsh accents around 😂  me and my mother have watched a few clips and heard some poeple talk to us and it's just "????????"  And we're Welsh and have had a hard time with it 😂 on another note, can confirm it is a sexy accent, me and my mate were being chatted up by some irish lads when they came over to Cardiff for the rugby, and we could have heard them talk forever 😂
Who else was drinking milk when he said go back to bed a drink milk?
The host is putting on an Irish accent. Wtf.
Jack sounded more like Walken than Walken sounded like an Irish lmao
The craziest thing is auto generated subtitles could actually understand most of those farmers words !!!!!!!! Try it yourself
Sounds like a different language lol
I feel like Newfies say "top of the mornin' to ya" than Irish people do.
Ay I am Scottish andIrish so you better watch out what you said about Scotland lad
póg mo thóin
I love hearing Jack complimenting Dublin accents,           Because thats my accent
Im Irish and I am nowhere close to understanding this shit.
Snatch is supposed to be gypsey I swear
poggers
The one about his sheep being stolen reminds me of nogla
love the irish whiskey ad on this video
Very important question do u say where or hwhere
To be fair to Brat Pitt have you seen that "Pikey Fight Call Out" video. Theyre fair close.  *Edit*  Did even better showing those rte gems to the world 💯
So Seán told me to drink milk.......just so happens I have a tall cup of milk in a jacksepticeye cup
OK but the second accent was at least understandable lol
Denmark is also a small country and I barely understand half of the accents in my fatherland... xD
Irish people are just built different
I R E L A N D
We're just built different
I just love the fact he referenced hot fuzz
SUBSCRIBE NOW!!!!!
I’m related to an Irish king
That was so delightful! It was great fun.    Could we maybe get a video where you translate other difficult to understand Irish accents?   Either way I loved it!
Yeah i did not understand ANYTHING from the guy with the sheeps 😂😂
It sounds close to a hard newfoundlanders accent, I was able to follow more than I though
Seán feels how i feel when i hear British voices in games and films and they just sound like that god awful stereotypical accent.
when he said "get f*cked italy" 🤣🤣
What, how is an italian accent sexy
2:25, you sound like that dude from fairly odd parents
Oh, shit you had me cracking up! She's not even Irish trying to teach this accent..Oh and the two Olympiads in Rio.. Hey in all honesty their accents were interesting kinda had an Irish slash Jamaican sound :-)
Did he just have to translate english for me?
Anyone else find it super hot that Jack could translate that farmer’s accent? 🥵😂
How can a man speak English and make it sound like another language, this is mind-blowing 😂
Was the farmer speaking Welsh or English
Sorry but what the living f**k is Jason stathman doing in an Irish film
Yer wan from kerry just moved dare I'd say. She was cheating
Well lad I am Irish too
@sgt ducky
Clearly the welsh accent is the sexiest, I love sounding like I’m singing constantly
it’s funny cause i know you are irish, but i straight up swear when you talk i feel like you never sound irish to me. you literally sound like you have the biggest american accent ever 😂❤️
I am Australian, my parents were born in England and my mum’s sister married an Irish man and his name is Se’an.
Brad was actually playing an Irish traveller
Why didn’t they just hire Irish actors. I mean.. saoirse Ronan and James mcavoy are just an example..
Up the Irish
Donegal also has some mad accents
You translating this is like me translating a terrible Newfoundland accent to my friend. "Where did he say that. Fucking where. No way that's English." 😂🤣
Jack sing some ira songs
Jack the limerick accent and the reason he had a spar bag on his head is cause his a rubberbandit search it up
Why people wimp horses ass poor horses transfer people to were they want to go (i know there are cars now but this is past i taking about) Just do not wimp horses ass and use a stick instead
''An American accent'' well I don't live in the US but I also bet they've got tons of different accents too
the southern Irish accent was a bop to listen to
Frost butt.
I think Christopher Walken’s accent wasn’t too bad. It was subtle; I think everyone is overreacting. I’ve definitely heard worse.
ah yes oirland
the last one about cork hit different oh Christ i'm questioning my voice
I think I was able to kind of understand the farmer and the rowers I got the gist of it
7:51 sounded more like you than you do
Oh gosh, Jack the look of visible pain when she was discussing "I" broke me...
To be fair to Brad Pitt, he's not doing an Irish accent, he's doing an Irish Traveller accent. Different culture.
why does sean have orange eyeliner
"Go back to drinking your milk bitch" but. I'm lactose intolerant jacl
Cant believe we got third, cant have anything in this house
I thought the farmer started talking in another language or just gibberish and throwing the word "sheep" often lmao
Irish accent voted sexiest in the world? Which one? Theres a different accent in every town.
My grandad is Italian and I did research on Italian and Irish accents but I can’t for the love of god understanding what the heck he’s saying
Boohoo well afrikaans is the sexist language
The Frostbit kid sounds like the Newfies in Canada. lol
I can kinda understand what he's saying 6:12
Plot Twist: they are doing good Irish Accents, Jack just does a bad one
I have no problems understanding you personally, but the first farmer and the student were impossible for me to understand. The second farmer I actually didn’t have any issues understanding for some reason lol.
This was amazing! More pls.
Ireland: *claimed for the sexiest accent* France: Hold up- 👁👄👁
What we need is jacksepticeyes power hour and get some LAUGHS!
Hey! Theatre kid here! So the reason videos like that exist is because often they’re used for something called “stage ____.” I am trained with stage British despite being an American. We use the most base-version of the accent without any dialect influences in order to replicate the accent as authentically as possible without the complication of a million different versions. She is most likely teaching a version of “stage-Irish” even if it isn’t marked as such.
6:47 "fortnite" ^∆^
I hate how I'm half Irish have like 80% living in Ireland and I'm hear in the UK. I could have a sex accent like Séan but nooo my parents decided Ireland wasn't good enough and moved to the UK 😭😭
Why is Italian voted the 2nd sexiest language in the world? Like, I don't wanna be having sex with someone with them constantly going "OoOh! MaMmA MiA"
The guy on the right at the start of the olympic interview is the kid who runs through the field in the C. Walken movie with his arms out.
If I had to say which Irish accent was my favorite it's the northside Dublin
That is NOT how you sound xD
Here that is not a kerry accent will ya get away
How to speak with an Irish accent, all u need to do is imagine your a bit drunk pirate
Jack Cork has the best accent and you know it
I'm Irish and its weird to watch this
Foil arms and hog guide to dublinesse
Jack's Irish accent is always WAYYYY stronger when he's talking about Ireland or something Irish (which is completely normal but I like it :) ) Update : well...he just said the same thing
ITS EXACTLY LIKE THE SCENE FROM HOT FUZZ! i can understand what he says because people i know actually speak like that (not everyone tho lmao)
"why didnt you cast irish people?" *a wild Jamie Dornan appears* well, at least thsts one  omg the farty five sheep one. probably my favourite accents video in history... the fact that you said "farty five", made a pause and your reaction was "thats a lot of sheep" and not about "fart"...yes. hahahaha  the best accent is of course mr farmer's. 20 years studying and knowing in english only to want to jump off a window cause im useless and cant understand enligsh ahahah
Jack’s Chris Walken is better than walken’s Irish.
Sean in Snatch Brad Pitt was playing as a gypsy that's why the accent was weird
Watching too many callmekevin videos and here i am saying feck instead of f**k
ur accent is really cool
Yeah I have some relatives from cork,I'm from waterford and have the time I havent a clue what there saying
I don't know if it's a good thing or a bad thing that I actually understood most of what the sheep farmer and the rowers were saying
Brad Pitt was speaking Piker.... It's just like slang talk.
This reminds me of my father. He is a literal "off the boat" Italian. Meaning, born in Italy, but Naturalized here in the U.S.   When I was a child, my family visited southern Italy, which is more Latin dialect. But up north, it is more a French influence. Even my dad had a hard time understanding the language up there!
I just got back from Ireland (county Louth) and luckily I could understand the people there
Are the Irish aware of how they sound? Because this is just gold 🤣
i understand most of these accents because my dad lived in offaly on a farm so i understand the farm accent my mums from cork and im from dublin
Nogla sounds like those swimmers to me. I have as hard of a time understand him as I do them. Makes me laugh because he looks so angry but all I can hear is a half woke  farmer looking for his sheep.
Here's a lesson in an Irish accent. Where myself and Seán are from, called County Westmeath, most people don't pronounce their t's. So water turns to "wauher" One like= one prayer for the pronunciation of my first name
I would love to see you do a video with Sgt. Ducky, about different Irish facts
Irish being the most sexiest accent and Italian second  My nonno (grandad) over here being half both lmao
why is derry never included :/
I am offended Sean didnt recognise the Rubber Bandits, is he actually an irish person?
My dad's Northern Irish, and he say mirror like "Muuuur"
"there are so many different dialects in it" "its like trying to do an american accent"  well ya see Jack, this is why many countries (and likely even ireland) adopt "official" accents (usually barely even a derivative of a real one) that get used for national broadcasts, to ensure programming can be accessed equally by all (so you dont have someone who speaks like the Sheep Farmer, or in America's case, someone from the Bayous of Louisiana, attempting to address the nation in an accent most of the nation cannot easily understand)
Do you like northern irish people?
"Powurfol ting" 😂 0:28
Why does that one guy sound backwards
I'm going to limerick University on an Erasmus program and hearing it's nicknamed Stab city i reeeaaally not reassuring
I'm German but I speak English a lot. Last year in July, I was in Ireland for one week and talked much with the people there. I really love the accent and the way they talk. And because I talked and listened so much, I use the Irish T-sound and feck instead of fuck when I curse. And all because of one week in Ireland
Jack reacting to these accents reminded me of when I a Minnesotan reacted to the Fargo movie accents
I didn't think Dublin was an accent,  but after hearing it compared to Americans I do now 😂
Sean, check out "yopper accents betcha' you haven't herd dat der" and "da yoopers"
Oh lord. I'm not a native english speaker and this video gave me such a hard time 0_0
It would be have been hilarious if Jack reacted to "Irish uncle cant find his soup"😂
I could speak to you in two accents: Mexican accent and American accent.
Hope there a limrick accent in this
Oh dear im going to ireland in January and il starting to think i won't understand a thing 😂
If he's wearing eye shadow, then hell yeah, you look great Sean (don't know where to put the accent.)!
The noisiest county in Ireland is actually Cork. Have you ever heard a proper Cork accent. The two lads with silver medals had a decent Cork accent but I know people with heavier accents than them from Limerick
Can anyone translate the "frostbit" boy...?
In my ears it's a combination of german and english together
Do you seriously not know the Spar bag is reference to The Rubberbandits??🤨 They're from Limerick
That movie was filmed in my town
Richie is throwing some serious shade
I’m irish and I thought I would understand the lad who lost his sheep but wtf was that lad saying????
Ahh the subscribers graph .... its here also.
6:05 HE SPEAKS THE LANGUAGE OF THE GODS!
It gets worse as "Wild Mountain Thyme" is a song about Scotland anyway. xD
What the FUCK JEFF??
Moooorrrreeeeee!!!!!!!
Hadn't heard the County Louth joke. Very similar to the fastest town in Ireland being Tuam (but that doesn't worth written down)
Chinese accents are bad lol. I can’t understand my grandma when she tries to speak English. It’s so broken.
Thank you for translating that video😂 i was like "is he speaking english?" 😂
How I feel whenever I try to decipher a good country Danish accent lol
Jamie Dormer is actually Irish and his accent still sounds off somehow (I'm aware it's not his normal accent but he would have a better idea of what actual Irish accents sound like)
why Irish people sound lile Russians trying to speak English?
Jack is an Irish accent expert lol
I'm Scottish
If u Weren’t Irish u would no clue what he was saying XD
Bruh im american and i can translate that farmer.
I understood half of what that farmer said
I'm convinced I can't understand English anymore
have ya ever seen the interview with the “sham” can’t understand the fella he spews absolute shite like it’s fuckin gibberish
I'm really good at understanding accents, even really thick ones, but what the fuck is the Irish farmer saying? 🤣😭💀
Is it sèan or séan
I’m Irish and I’m cringing so much at this ☘️😬
U sure the framer isn't speaking german
You Should react to 'Irish Slang' 100x times worse than English Slang
4:00 are the pikes
I have a Mayo- irish accent
I could listen to the kerry accent bit 10,000,000 times, and I still will never understand him.
That farmer, was like dealing with Jedwards Dad, I never believed anyone till I had to work with them for a night, fun lads but their Dad, you need a translator.
That is gibberish
i'm irish (from cork) but i've watched so much american stuff growing up that i just have no accent left
I have family from Ballylongford in Co Kerry and they all sound like that. I still have issues understand them some days.
Someone speaking a different language: Me: shit i can't understand *sweats nervously*  Some person behind me: *demonic moaning*
The Drogheda accent is absolutely Garbage. There is NOTHING sexy about it.
Irish man gets mad at other Irish man and becomes more Irish man
With the sh when you say shut is it like shush so shush up not shut up
The Kerry-not-so-irish girl was cute asf ngl
Sean in Spiderman games: *turns into a newyorker* Sean with the lads: *turns into a leprachaun* Sean trying to create the THICCEST irish accent: *turns into a rune mage*
Jokes on you! I'm already in bed and I'm lactose intolerant!!
They're basically loud mumblers.
It's nice seeing sean getting progressively more irish as the video moves
Next Jack will teach us Irish Gaelic
2:36 "COME ON, THAT DOESN'T SOUND IRISH" me: HA!!! now you know how your insulative British accent feels
"Why didn't you just cast Irish people?" cut to Jamie Dornan.  idk why but that cracked me up, ignore me.
Cw could be in a commercial for the phone book and make millions lol
The one in the instructional video is fine if you're going specifically for Northern Ireland around the late Victorian period to about WWI—which is exactly the type of Irish accent that Americans would be most familiar with, since that was exactly where and when most of North America's ethnic Irish population came over from.
I pity anyone not Irish trying to understand us especially when we speak at our natural fast pace
Under the skin has a Irish man on a bus and I have no fookin clue what he says
‘I’m drunk let’s make out’ ‘ I MeAn hE’S nOt WroNg’
Lady: Oreland. OrElAnD. Jack: IrElANd
I want more funniest home vids
All that I could make out was mountings
I could actually understand the Farmer 😂 this made me laugh so much! We are Irish are a special breed alright 🤣
I could barely understand the reporter... let alone the farmer.
E say n edge is n edge e dunno wha reapers moanin bout
*eat shit *
On the video of the farmer who lost his sheep i thought they were speaking Japanese for a second
Northen dublin is just YES ykno?
In conclusion, south Irish accent sounds like mix between German and Ukrainian
Me: yeah subtitles Subtitles: Djshsjsjjshsjsjsjsjsiwehebudbejsjsbsksbsjssj
Director: WE SHOULD CAST JACKSEPTICEYE I'M SO STUPID
Day 53 of saying trans rights on random channels till I get testosterone
Ahhhhh the fact everything about limerick is true! It's literally called stab city and I live in it 🤣
Man, yer one IS NOT from kerry she is english like um- no
I find it funny how if it was any other culture, it would be labeled "racist" or "cultural appropriation" but sure who gives a feck as long as you're white
It’s funny when Sean says someone’s Irish accent is so fake when he doesn’t even have one 😂 and when he does put one on it’s about as fake as theirs
Very glad I did not do this when I was tired when this came out three days ago or however long. 5? Anyway,  I'm moving to north dub to get me a wife, but I want you to dive deeper into the Irish accent myself. So diverse, interesting they are. As a dunn. We so few. I must say, do the Irish proud! (Sarcasm on the few, fyi)
When an Irish person says something with a t in it, it comes out like 'Is I-?'
YESSSSS you cant categorise the irish accent because theres about 20 different accents in one county 🤣🤣
Imagine getting lost in Ireland and have to ask for directions but you don’t understand a focking word. 😂😂😂
you dont sound like that, I am from Austria and I understand you xDD
i died when he started translating 💀 i got none of it
You're right though as an American.... I can confirm that there is a shit ton of different accents here and especially like Appalachian and really deep South accents it can be hard to understand what the hell people are saying even though you're both from the same country. It's easy enough to learn like a general accent like there's a way of doing a southern draw. But where I'm from here in Colorado there's certain little tiny nuances that make it unique to our area of the US.. It's one thing to get a broad generalization of certain words but definitely not the be all or end all of an accent. To be honest you kind of have to spend a lot of time in a certain region of a country in order to even begin to crack the accents of that country.
Brad Pitt you're lucky your gorgeous
I absolutely loved this 💚 There's just something about Irish accents that just makes my soul happy.
I'm mostly Irish but I've just got an Australian accent, mainly because I live in Australia.
That farmer wasn’t even speaking English half the time 😂😂😂
Jack is the only English native speaker who understands what a dialect is.
Is it just me or at 2:21 when jack was talking about the rock did he sound like Arnold Schwastnizer 🤣🤣
I'm cringing
Dude I want more!!!! Idc just make moooooooore
I hear that Ballyhaunis shoutout <3
Me: hmm My brain: Irish isn’t real
When you’re Irish but don’t have the accent:
This whole video: Irish sounds intensifies
Legit just had a nightmare that that farmer was trying to say something important to me, and Jack refused to translate, so I was panicked out of my mind.
YES. Some of my family members are from kenmare. Absolute mad accents
Why does brad pitt sound like a Sim lmaoo
Howa ya now brown cow
The kid talking about getting frostbite went to school with my friend's brother ahaha
Where's the Northern Irish representation, Seán?!?!?
I wonder if he has seen Song of the Sea, WolfWalkers, Secret of the Kells and (Breadwinner, which I haven't seen yet) 🤔
I’m Scottish but this is absolute shiet
Dude, I speak and understand Patois. This was hard af to understand. Bombaclatt, mi no speak Gaelic, ease haad.
Lol
I'm irish too
Farty five shep and tha oon ligh and a walk wih tha dawg
I'm from Ireland and I don't have an accent I'm sad
12:19 EXACTLY! My mate who is Irish watched one of this how to sound Irish videos and he was like 'That's not How I sound you stupid fecker!' Each Town, or region or north or south all different. I have a handful of Irish friends from many parts and neither one of them sound the same. Two do but they're both from Dublin. 18:27 Oh god no! XD
Irish and indian accent have been so typicalised by Hollywood its the same in India with all the states and also we share a lot similar flag
Was that guy in the last video about to say the Northern Irish accent? He better not have we've got different accents too and if there's one thing I'm certain of I do not sound like I'm from fucking Belfast.  Also the farmer isn't hard to understand cause he's Irish it's cause he's a farmer, my neighbour's a farmer and I swear I cannot understand a word that man says...
U need to be Irish to have the accent, it's just facts! shur I'm Irish myself 😂
Gotta watch this with my Irish stepdad at some point
He didn't do the one with the old man in the bar
My nan is 100% Irish an she speaks says things like mirrrrrrrrrr
This was hilarious. 😂😂 I love videos on accents though. Definitely earned their status of being the sexiest accent honestly.
American's:how can Irish people understand that farmer  Irish people:we can't either
Have you ever been so Irish that a Irish couldnt understand the Irish that speaks Irish so I could Irish that speaks Irish Irish?
Irish farmer spoke Minecraft enchantment table
Me, sat with my auditory processing disorder, listening to the farmer: o.O
I’m from county Mayo but Jesus the Kerry farmer sounded like he was speeding Russian
wexford accent d best  - the wexford gang
ive never been to ireland. ive never actually met someone from ireland, but i understood most of the things the farmers were saying... howw
being Irish and from The same area as sean its weird because you like the only youtuber ik whos accent sounds normal
Hey Jack are you okay? I'm noticing what looks like some bruising in the corner of your eyes. Take care of yourself, okay?
react to more accents!
I like your accent Sean. Eventhough I know it's not an accent to you but I'm American. I'm Italian, German and Polish but I love an Irish and British accent. Also I love when you do other accents.
The manbun cancels out everything.
I am from the deep South in the U.S and for some reason people ask if I'm Irish. Doesn't make any damn sense.
Jack: "I'm a vowel-bender" Me, a linguist: "Is that a challenge, mate?"
Im part irish scottish dutch welsh and danish but my accents are shit ;-; sometimes i have accents in a few words i speak like i cant say them properly. Idk im just dumb XD
There's a slight problem with your description of Brad Pitt's character in Snatch and it's that he isn't Irish. He's a Piker which is a derogatory slang term for Welsh people. It's disappointing that an American has to explain this to you.
I'm Irish too
My pop (now deceased) was an Irish immigrant and my nan (still alive) is from hermany
There is not only one accent...there can be the Cork one a Dublin one and much more...  Ua the swimmers are from Cork. U can tell by the accent.  One thing u won't miss about Ireland is the weather
Honestly not bad. But I want Jack in New Zealand 🇳🇿

At 7.30 he had me laughing out loud. "this is what we get up to" 😂
This kid in my drama class tried to do an irish accent and they sounded awful.
when people try to mimic your voice, they're often trying to copy your REALLY old videos where you pretty much screamed your intro
I’m from Tipp and Jesus my dad’s accent is so heavy I ask him again and again what he’s sayin
B0b0 @mp
Jack: focuse on the accent   Me: wow cows and horses  ooh fluffy sheep 🐑 😍 💕 💖
I can understand like 10%-20% of that *THICCC* Irish accent
Is they're an accent for American people? IDK
My ancestors came from Southern Ireland
0:25 im surprised that Australia is in the top 5
I am Scottish. I went to new York a few years ago and no one could understand me at all!  Even when I asked for water 😬🙃  I didn’t think I had a strong accent but hey  Also people always ask me if I’m Irish so maybe it’s that
JUST LOVED THIS ONE, IM LITERALLY CRYING OF LAUGH!!!!!!!!
This video could be golden if you d have your boys in it reacting too KEVIN, NOGLA,TERRORISER
me listening: *hears farty five* *dies* (yes ik its forty five but the why its said is just hilarious
ima a tiny bit upset cause Kilkenny wasn't there and neither was dublin
The Brad Pitt one pretty good, it's an Irish travelers accent
8:10 dude sounds like the mayor from whoville
G
Well I'm from Dublin and I don't even sound like that
Ohh ohh ohh. i'm wearing my bunnet
English isn't even my first language...
Honestly Jack, watching your videos helped me learn how to fake one for roleplaying puposes (D&D, specifically). I think I've gotten pretty good at it, in the sense that my sounds are consistent and I can pick it up at pretty much any point and roll right into it. But even after watching this, man...I have no idea where the accent *I* do would fit on a map of Ireland. I'm pretty sure it just doesn't fit anywhere, lol.   For context, the way I've learned to do it is with the shape and placement of my cheeks and tongue; I keep my cheeks a little tense and tight and my tongue is about constantly arched in the back. And that lets me just jump into it whenever the mood strikes -- without being ridiculously thick and cringy (I hope).
Me: I’m Northern Irish this should be easy  * the man starts rambling about sheep *  Also me: *turns on subtitles*
Anyone else Irish and just like 😐
In my town there's a male accent and a female accent as well
Wait I thought new Zealand had the sexiest voice
I feel like this Wild Mountain Thyme movie is like Jojo Rabbit where everyone still has theri accent but says "zee" and "ja"
the beauty of being northern english is you understand irish accents, scots language and scot accent,  london accent and london slang, welsh accent and welsh slang, and plus the northern english slang.  we are the only part of britain where you can understand all spoken english and similar to english language from birth
Don't know about the Snatch one. There's a channel with Irish people who completely understood What he said
My brain hurts. I think I broke my brain.
5:53 I’m from Glasgow in Scotland  and can kind of understand a bit of it 🤣
Lady: oile   Sean: OIl
My great grandpather had a very thick Irish accent I’ve only knew him for a few months tho
why he sound like gru saying this 2:21
What's up with the color around Jack's eyes?
I can understand the heavy accents but just barely
Seán's Walken is better than Walken's Irish
I can sound exactly like the Leprechaun off of the leprechaun.
why does Jack look's like he's in sage mode
I feel like the irish accent is pretty much as difficult as a new zealand accent. People try to do it and end up sounding south african or British bahaha
U want f up dialecks com to Norway. I am a suthing and I think som dialects are Talking about kake when descusing Road akcidents.
honestly dont hear much accent with this guy but i been watching his videos for a wile now you want to hear strong accents go to the bios of new orleans the kayjin folk be hard to understand

Im Irish like I live here but I didn't understand that farmer lad
Love how séan doesn’t roast Australia cos we’re so awesome P.s 18:37 why does it look so weird
Also I just started watching your videos (and love them!), so I don't know if you've mentioned this before, but I would've LOVED to see your reaction to Markiplier's impersonation of you. Heehee. =D <3
Woah woah woah! Was that English that they were speaking! I thought they were speaking in some other language when I saw these clips before.
I'm Irish 😎........Like 20%.....  And I can't even do an Irish accent..... I can do a New Zealand accent well though
you either love or you hate an irish accent. and if you hate it you're wrong." -Spedicey 2020  (20:50)
How old is you
It's taking every bit of concentration to understand the heavy accent
2:18 I CHOKED ON MY WATER WTF WAS THAT. XD Christopher Walkin is an AMAZING actor, but he's way too signature to not be Christopher Walkin, my goodness.
“ **haha eat shit  F r a n c e** “
Being oregonian I can understand what is being sad, but I can't re say it exactly nor could I replicate it. However being oregonian also means if I'm talking with someone with a thick accent I'll accidentally slip into doing their accent. I wish I could explain why that happens.
well i come from france my father is french and my mother is Irish  sooo im french and Irish xD
Heavy irish accent? Or just German?
Kevin tried to interpret the sheep farmer a while back and that was a trip
OMG the closed captions could NOT keep up! 🤣
Froshtbutt
I love Ireland, I went on a Europe trip and Dublin was my favourite. The people are so nice and charming. 💕
If you’ve ever heard the Limerick band, The Rubber Bandits, you know Brad Pitt was pretty darn close to perfect.
0:40 no jack
whenever i hear Emily Blunt,   i only hear Tempest Shadow :)
lowkey thought the dude who got his sheep stolen wasn't speaking English for a second
This cracks me: 00:37  ''Hahaha ~ Jack, you should subscribe to your own channel! Hahaha.. -go back to bed, child. Start drinking more milk, bitch.''  immediately laughs his own insults both himself and whatever 'the child' was  XD
Fun fact: when watching that Snatch scene “Caravan talk” with subs..not even they know what the fuck he’s saying and just says “????”
Really everyone with an Irish accent has there own accent. They just base it off the Irish accent
As an Australian, I can say: I feel your pain
All I hear is “Myklashipewatrymun”
Im sick of these youtubers trying to guilt me into subscribing to them by shoving their subscription rate in my face.
Ah I remember my time in Ireland fondly. We stayed on the slieve league cliffs in teelin, Donegal, county Donegal in the Slieve League B and B which was  owned by Ken, who everyone seemed to know. The b an b was also very cheep at just around 350 euro for us both for the week. We drove all the way up from Dublin to the b and b and drove around Ireland. We walked up the cliffs, beautiful views. Sheep's and collies seemed to just wander about on the roads, sometimes holding up traffic. We went to bundoran, where I learnt to surf and my friend got a chamrock tattoo. We went to glencolummbkille (which we were taught how to pronounce correctly) , and we went to malin beg which was beautiful. I got to drive my first boat over there. I went barefoot on the beautiful beaches and exploded hidden caves, wrote our names in the sand. It was a great time. I quite miss Ireland I'd like to visit again one day
ya like DAGS
Why does he look like he form in sage mode from naruto.
Its funny that jacksepticeye and me are  1: Irish 2: youtubers 3:have over 20 games at least
I definitely get frost butt.
This video should be renamed to "21 minutes and 13 seconds of incoherent irish gibberish"
I heard Mr Tim Hortons very real
i could listen to this allllll day
Jesus this looks like a parody
This was amazing 😂 I always have a hard time understanding my family members when they visit, but after a few days I understand them better. I was hoping Jack would review/translate the video of the old man with the impossible to understand accent, in the bar being interviewed. lol the YMH fandom has me forever searching for that video anytime someone says they can’t understand my extended family 😂 bless that gentleman’s heart but I still have zero clue what he’s saying for most of the interview. 🙈
See now I'm just really invested in that farmer and his sheep. I hope he got them back.
In a nice little place in county kerry, my friends and I shared some drinks with these nice guys where two I hate to admit I couldn't understand anything they said. That was before the heinekens.
Jacks space key is gonna be destroyed by the end of this video
5:34 WHAT'D HE SAAAAY
The thing about saying "_______ accent" ...people do it with every country. Like the number of times I hear "British accent". He even said it in the video about the Kerry girl. What does that even mean? There are 3 countries in Britain and across those 3 countries there are hundreds of accents. I know for a fact that people definitely know a Scottish accent and an English accent are very different so why speak like your the queen or cockney and not say at least that its an English accent instead of British. That's like saying "Its a European accent". ~signed someone from Wales who doesn't sound like someone from England or Scotland
Dude I got a body wash Irish ad
"It's just M - I and then fifteen R's."  I had no reason to laugh at that as hard as I did. XD Also, it's pretty surreal to be an American and start watching these accent videos. Like, damn, I want to apologize to everyone in the frikkin UK because Jesus fucking Christ, what the hell are we even doing?
fucking hell not even subbittles can understand shit right
MY GOD I thought Wild Mountain Thyme was a PARODY. I kept waiting for zingers.
They are right about Irish being the sexist accent lmao
Going to bed: nahhh Staying up and watching my favorite Irish man: YESSSSSSSS
He should react to dino's accent from FFXV
Irish people : good thing I’m Irish    Non Irish : I DONT KNOW WHAT THE FUCK HES SAYING BUT ITS HOT
My gran is Irish and I didn’t even understand one word the Irish farmer said 💀💀
Ughhhh I wanted to dislike the video because it was at 899 and that’s a strong thing to resist just for the satisfaction.
Some quality “Irish ASMR”
i swear that guy talking about the sheep was speaking a whole different language😭
"classified as sexiest accent in the world" second to corpses obviously
As someone from Northern Ireland I cant understand the sheep guy at all 😭😭 also I'm pretty sure frostbit kid is from N.I. too! Closer to the south, which is why he sounds more Irish 😊
*"irish man makes fun of non-irish people for 20 minutes"*
the schoolboy’s accent sounds like a perfect combination between a boston accent, wisconsin accent, and an irish accent.
When he stoped at french i knew why he did If he said something bad about Australia..... Im sorry R.I.P
I learnd how to do an Irish acsant by lisening to irish pepole and repeting it back lick im lerning a new language or something. And it cinda sucks

Me: *enjoying the video* Ads: *AFK GAME.* *ALIEN BABE FALLS INTO YOUR ARMS*
Im scared
(0:27) here as you can see jack skipped over the Australian accent, jack is hiding the truth, the Australian accent is the true *most sexy accent of all time.*
Do Irish baby’s have Irish accents
He should watch the Matchmaker from the 90s. It actually has Irish actors
The Connecticut, a state in America , accent forgets the T in most words. Look it up.
Jack: I went to college in this place called "Stab City" Me: Ah, that's why he loves murder so much
im part irish and i willingly admit that i cant sound irish for the life of me. i can barley sound australlian
24 seconds into the video and I hear,  “GET FUCKED ITALY!”
Sean: Try saying mirror. It's just M-I and like 15 R's.. Me too Sean, me too.
12:13 That's the problem. For that Thyme movie they should have picked a town and studied just the one accent! The characters are all from one town it looks like, from the trailer. There you go. Problem solved.
*Germans on June 14th 1940* : 0:27
we used to be friends with someone who's favorite phrase was, and i quote, "Thunder Cunt" but he had an accent and he said it "Tunder Coont"
Was a shit joke sean
Mmmm milk
yehhhh, s'bose..
Jack: Oh come on! That’s hilarious though   Me: *Can’t tell the difference* Yeah man! Come on!
we all know that Saoirse Ronan is the only Irish actor/actress come on
my grandfather was from Ireland and he would start telling stories and once he got going it became harder and harder to follow what he was saying. You'd have to stop him and tell him his Irish was was showing and he'd slow down and the accent would die down a little lol.  I loved listening to him though. :)
Can i have some fleer
Flir...I'm dead😆
we really are built different.
Its bad that I could understand that whole accent farmer piece
Yer man Frostbit was so famous in Derry after that clip from the news, I was at uni there at the time and ye would see him being swarmed at the bus depo after school with fans looking photos lol
“ Why didn’t you just cast Irish people? “ Just what every dummy thinks: “couldn’t find any that fit the description or worked well with.” This also is related to the one and only ableist singer Sia for her awful offensive ableist music video.
Can’t bate the bogger accent of the midlands
"Start drinking more milk BITCH" that part had me dying 😂😂😂
Brad pit sounded more like a gypsy than an Irish man in that clip
”music you call it? Music...”
The yea that jack screamed around 5:40 tho
THOSE FARMERS SOUND LIKE THEY ARE BEING PLAYED BACK IN REVERSE
If people think an irish accent is ugly search up a Brazilian accent im Brazilian and i even cringe at it
made me smile the whole video. Will make my dead Irish grandad laugh too.
doblun
"10:30 jack," look at graph!!
And here I thought Spanish was the most romantic and sexist language XD
That UTV clip of the boy warning of "frostbit" is Northern Irish not Irish, people from N.I r British not Irish...I'm from Belfast in N.I so that means I'm British so that shouldn't be Included in the "Irish accent" vid tbh
I have a mix of Irish and Australian
I hope I can understand the cringe so I can finish the video. too bad
*mirrrrrrrrrrrrrrr*
I'd hate to be those rowers. They probably got busted for craic
I'm French...........offended!           lol
next video is gonna be about the irish independence war
I was losing it when he started translating because it's literally the same language and I COULDN'T GET IT WITHOUT THE TRANSLATION LMAO
hi jack, I've been a fan since before happy wheels episode 1 :D please notice my existence
I can understand the farmers and I'm American... I think I'm the crossbreed lol
xxxx
bruh i lost it at 11:50
Fellow irishman here down in wexford
Aboydakid! Nice to see Limerick represented. Blindboy rocking the spar bag. Yurt!
My iris friend, lily, taught me what "what's the craic" meant
*HERB*
I'm waiting for the day Hollywood do a Movie in Ireland with actual Irish people. It would sound so much better, obviously, and if it's difficult to understand they can just put subtitles in it haha. I always hate it when I hear people do a Cork Accent. I don't speak that way at all hahaha. I admit I know a good few people that talk that way to be fair, which sometimes annoys me because I can't tell if that's how they talk, which is fine, or they are doing it on purpose just to sound cool with their friends. Some people might not get this but I heard of a few people who would speak prim and proper to their family when at home but as soon as they go out with their friends it goes from "Hi, Mom. How are you getting on? Will I run down to the shop and get some milk?" and as soon as they leave the house and are around friends its like they have a split personality and they talk like this with friends "Watz da stry Boi? Watz da crack wit u? Any sca? Nah Boi nutin hapnin wit me boi? Shes a dacent lookin Beuor over der boi? Yur wan over der look?" OMG!!! haha, nothing against them I just don't like people that force an accent. When I speak with people and say where I'm from in Cork they never believe me at first. Thy always say "You don't speak like someone from there? You pronounce your words more clearly and Don't act like people from there. You don't use as much slang". Don't get me wrong I love Irish slang but I just don't use certain ones which everyone is used to hearing. I hate the word Beuor, but I used to say Dacent a lot and my mom used to kill me for it. When I got older I realised it does sound stupid and silly alright. Dacent is slang for Decent if someone doesn't know. The one thing I'm trying to stop saying because I notice I say it a lot is "D'ya know what I mean Like? Translate to "Do you undertstand what I'm talking about/saying? I also say me instead of my a lot now due to the fact I was doing a course in college with people from all over the place and now working with a good mix of accnets that my own has nearly become a hybrid mix of them all haha.
i want a video where jack just watches gealic spongebob
Let's not forget, Jacksfilms is called John and Jacksepticeye is called Seán which is Irish for John.
Dude, is this the same as a heavy southern accent in the US being understood by americans, but not so easily by anybody out of the country?? Because holy shit I can not believe Sean was able to understand the sheep were stolen under a full moon. I heard fairy speech.
Thanks for explaining that the "Accent" is a shit ton of dialects, cause people never understand and it annoys us all.
when Seán said to just hire real Irish people and then Jamie Dornan, who is Northern Irish, shows up in the next frame 👀
I sometimes feel like it sounds Scottish more than anything, and not even Scottish, more of a mix between Scottish, Irish, and a piece of shit.
Funny thing is is that my great great great grandparents were born in Ireland. I can understand a bit of what theyre saying and Im american😂😂
Was actually expecting the "NEED TO HAVE A SHITE!!" scene. Lmao.
It sounds like it's speaking Spanish while speaking Bridge in Irish
I think you said over 45 sheep I don't know
NO NORTHERN IRELAND!!!! UNACCEPTABLE!!!!!!!!!!
ALL I CAN THINK ABOUT IS WHEN UNAS ANNUS CALLED JACK TRYING TO DO AN IRISH ACCENT🤣🤣🤣
is that guy in the clip just mumbling?!
THE HELL IS THAT GUY IN THAT CLIP SAYING?!
Jack I genuinely have a hard time understanding Irish accents and cant do one myself but for the entirety of the time i've been subscribed (since 2 mil for reference) you've been one of the clearest spoken irishmen i've ever watched, seen, or listened to   Don't worry you're doing fine don't change a thing in my opinion
Jack! I have a question! i was told to say i was for one Ireland United... ... ... Under British rule... ... ... To get in a fight while in Ireland... Any tips to make it work?
the irish farmer just sounds like he's speaking greek mixed with something else
thyme the 𝗵𝗵𝘂𝗥𝗯
*Im slowly becoming Irish while watching this.*
Could you review the Irish accents from Back to the Future 3 please???
So to answer your question , I am not sub I come here from time to time because sometimes you make content I like others I don't and I don't like my subscription to be bombarded like crazy. I was subbed for a long time like since you was 1000 sub but you have moments of cringe and moments of bad content and that made me unsubscribe. But I do wish you the best and I do stop by from time to time watch like 5 videos and come back 1 month later again. I know you won't read it but you asked and I answered.
There's a video that was going around a while back as an example of a brutal Scottish accent (Limmy's Show - water) that's got a guy speaking scots that none of my friends could understand, but made perfect sense to me. So I thought I had a good handle on the various accents of the British isles.   But that Irish farmer might as well have been speaking Klingon for as well as I could understand him.
I like how the sexiest accent in the world was decided by 5000 people 😂
Why neglect the north?
2:22 - 2:30 séan sounds like he is Arnold Schwarzenegger
Sean and Aisling Bea have my fave Irish accents ...
I kinda wanna give Brad Pitt extra credit as the irishman in Snatch since he was playing the character of an Irish Gypsy _and apparently the point was him being unintelligible_ haha
Mikey needs himself a gun like auld Richie down the road
Jack, when did you decide you wanted to become Irish?
"Which Irish accent is the sexiest?"   Obviously CallmeKevins
In high school I was in drama.. I had to play an Irish mother.. From like old school times.. I was chosen cause I was good at doing voices and accents.. OMG.. I think about it.. It's so cringe.. Hahahahaha "Yosephs a good laddie that be ye knowing ye Raised him pRopeR these last 19 yeaRs".. That was in 2004 or 2005 that I did that.. And I somehow still remember the very first line I had.. LMFAO
the irritating thing about that Wild Mountain Thyme film is that there are so many decent Irish actors in Hollywood that would have taken the job
Me confused on how I can understand some of the stuff they say 😂😂😂😂
If ya come back come to castletownbere west cork it's nice out
Him reacting to the peaky blinders
One of the funniest moments in my life was in an Irish pub not being able to understand a single bloke and them not understanding my Welsh accent. Was absolutely hilarious
"GO BACK TO BED BITCH" lmao
I love this video 😍
I figured out where my grandma was from county cork and I've got 75 percent Irish and 10 percent Scottish from the Mullikin family so I just love this soo much and love Ireland so much
Kinda reminds me of my grandpa who had a pretty thick southern accent that hardly anyone could understand yet the German exchange student we had understood what he was saying and didn't notice the accent..
Brad Pitt is playing a gypo
As a brazilian, I couldn't understand a single person in this video besides Jack (and the hollywood actors). AND I LOVED IT
Most become bitter with age but Jack just gets more positive
i actually understood the kid getting on the bus better than anyone else 😂 im half irish so i feel a bit ashamed that i dont understand the others except one to two words 😂😂
5:50 dude sounds like he’s speaking Gaelic
wish the unus annus moment was in here but ... ya know.... :(    2 men 200 accents was genuinely one of my favorite videos.
Not even the Irish lad could understand the horrendous accents of what we call Irish accents.
Fleur, ce n'est pas francais
Me a French student who's going to study in Ireland looking up to Irish accent to see what I'm getting into :  *cries in not understanding a single word*
Brad Pitt was spot on, his character was a gypsy and stereotypically that’s how they speak
😂😂 I have family from cork, oh that Southern irish accent is something else
Well, that vid was hilarious! More Irish them vid :D <3
I still don’t know how an actual irish accent sounds like
jack has such an athlone accent its mad
Found myself with a huge ass smile
Who heard frostbutt instead of frostbite
That's farmer sounded like a Liverpudlian more than Irish 🤭
I was on a choir trip to Cork (from America). We were staying at this dude's house, he would drive us and sometimes a few farmers into town when they needed it..... One of the farmers was trying to have a conversation with me and FOR THE LIFE OF ME I couldn't understand a word he said.... That was 8 years ago and I still feel bad
Dude hwyte ppl are good at casting other hwyte ppl for roles that they dont fit. They will jump thru hoops to cast another hwyte person before they cast someone that actually fits the description and its sad
the casting team on Wild Mountain Thyme were fools not to cast Saoirse Ronan
The part when you’re translating that all you need is a good dog to guard the ewes, I thought the guy was talking about moonshine
after you said it i could clearly understand before i could understand maybe half of what the guy as saying lol
Im glad that swedish is on the list on the sexiest languige
I LOVE it and I don't understand why. 😄
Farmers with mad accents talking about disappearing sheep on the news... Is Ireland and Norway actually the same place???
And then theres Ethans "Irish" accent and Marks French/Scottish trying to be Irish accent attempts...
I'm not laughing at the Irish. I'm laughing WITH the Irish
ethan had the best irish accent but the clip is gone now so
Sean just wanted to tell you that my dad saw you once at a YouTuber thing idk. Before you even died your hair. Also. My friend lived beside you before you moved.
6:03 dId I hAvE a StRoKe?!!!!!!
One thing to note, Accents morph over time, at with the westernization/globalization of the world, all accents are slowly getting watered down.  So as much as Brad Pitt's accent might seem ridiculous now, you'll wanna compare his accent to the accents at the time (20+ years ago) and not what is current day.
What a wholesome video
At 2:22 when Jack was making fun of Christopher Walkens why did he sounds like Gru from Despicable Me 😂
Can I have the second lady in the blindfold video? 👉👈🥺
I’m Northern Irish and we are essentially a light British accent until you get out of Bangor, then it’s just a strong norn iron accent that turns in the ŚÉÂŃ when you go down south. Might get frostbit
5:33 Man speaking enchantment table.
I love the concept and agenda of this video because a IRISH MAN is literally pointing it out, I just love the reaction and real facts coming from Jack😂
The large piece of Irish in me actually understand Ed almost all of this.
That guy's accent sounds like a different language
I sometimes start talking in a Donegal (Maghery-Burtonport area) accent although I've only visited a few times.
im so impressed you were able to translate that dude jack what the heck LMAO
What is the background music please? I've been wondering for so long
Yes i know this is a long shot but i had a cray idea! Jack give us lessons on how to do an Irish accent! I would double thumbs up if i could if you do that! And double my sub!! :P
I had family in west cork and its alot of just smiling and nodding at people. spar bag man....is blind boy right?
it's the same sense with a Yorkshire accent; there's so many towns and villages that have different accents that you can't just do a singular yorkshire one XD accents are weird but cool
Farty five sheep
me and the boys looking for bigfo... what okay  me and the boys looking for irish ascent
I was sad to see this end, RIGHT BEFORE HE STARTED TALKING ABOUT NORTHERN IRELAND!! Dont forget about us Jack, we’re Irish too :(
Gonna be honest, i couldnt understand a thing the sheep farmer was saying 😂
Lol im from Ireland
I am 90% Irish
now you know how americans feel when yall try to do our accent and just sound like valley girls
It’s true, his accent gets stronger 😂😂
maybe you should go back to ireland wink wink
this is my favourite vid of yours in a while
Wheres sham
honest after 1 minutes I was able to understand the accent and I find it fascinating!!! I like it 👀
Based off this vid tho you should do a video kind of picking apart the Irish accent. Thick or not. I think people who are trying to learn the accent (for acting) could benefit from it. (If he has already done a vid like that plz let me know)
I can’t be mad just cuz it’s Emily Blunt and Jamie Dornan.
that like to dislike ratio says a lot
*Foaurtee-faive shepp*
You were hilarious in this video 🤣🤣🤣 good shit brotha
The ultimate try not to laugh is watching jack in class when you’re supposed to be working.          Not that I’d know about that or anything,,,,,
yer one. imma just use that now thanks
sean having to translate english to english because we had no clue what they were saying just feels wrong for some reason
WHAT THE FUCK JEFF? 😂😂😂
The progression from these random rowers come to our school before apparently going to the Olympics (cool but whatevs) they get silver, entire town and surrounding area go mad, entire country is cheering them on for months on end, becomes really popular on YT due to their funny interview, 3 years later appears on Mr Spedicey video where he references my town, very nice.
Where are u from because I'm from galway
Just had to write a radio report for school... I knew exactly what to do...        It's about a dude who has lost 45 sheep
jackseptickeye trying to sound like cristopher walkins trying to sound irirsh sounds like gru
Every time I attempt an Irish accent it quickly turns Scottish, I’m so sorry
Watching this made me realize just how much of an accent jack really had and i love it.
Since english is my second language deciphering irish people and scotts is like taking a masterclass at Uni xD
My favorite is frostbit
Being a bad winner to Italy, then lightening up to Scotland before going back to a bad winner for france-
When you are from skibbereen😂😳also in 2016 pat and Paul the rowers came down to skibbereen and I was there!!!!
Why does the sheep guy remind me of gru?
6:42 I could understand that guy but not the first one at all lmao
This is hilarious. I think Irish accents are the best.
Man i can understand thick irish accents 100 points for hufflepuff
How to do an Irish accent.   Step 1: Be born in Ireland Step 2: Own a field and cattle Step 3: Lose half your cattle.   You have now unlocked the Irish accent.
8:08 ngl as a german.. i though he was german
Christ almighty, Frostbit boy went to my school. Heard him about 10 minutes before you saw him.
All I got from the sheep guy was how’d “anyone go up in the mountains”  😂🤣
I can understand SOME of what he was saying The rowers I could understand about 90%
This hits better when youre actually irish 😂😂
I’m not sure if i feel guilty about being able to understand most of the accents or I should be proud 😭😭😂
Im part irish and I only have an Irish accent with certain words but I'm also german so i have that accent with some words too
I live in Mullingar and my accent is alot different to Sean's
I wanna hear a conversation between Seán and Mike from ThatChapter
17:32 her parents are from Kerry but she was 100% raised in England lol
Sean out here making fun of people doing an Irish accent, meanwhile anyone who does an American accent always does the same region. Always. The same. Fucking. Region
Oh man I have friends who’s parents, and/or grandparents have Irish accents that I cannot for the life of me understand a word they say. I live in Boston, you know just a stones throw from Ireland.
I lived in Ireland for a while. I had no problem understanding the accent in Galway, Dublin and even the few smaller little towns, but then I went to Northern Ireland and the Belfast accent melted my poor American brain. 😆
im romanian, and tbh if a romanian compliments you and you dont understand the language, youll prob. think hes planing how to jump you XD
I had an Irish ad on a Irish speaking video😂😂
I love all of them especially the Cork one 😂😂😂 they speak just like my pap except he's got a southern accent. And says "poosh" instead of "push"  I have some Irish blood, but not sure where in Ireland. The DNA test only said German and Irish ancestry. Which one of my maternal great great something ancestors or grandparents was Irish. But nobody tells us crap in my family lol 🙃
The most bizzar things I have heard Christopher Walken say are  1: "This is not over. BEARS!"  2: All of the "I wanna be like you" song in the new jungle book movie
I'm right next tae Ireland, just outside af Glasgae and I don't even knaw what this lad is saying
I’m sad this video had to end
This was fun lol
“aggh brad pitt,, Youre lucky you’re gorgeous” LOL
I had to be in speech all throughout Elementary school because no one could understand me when I spoke my r's and people always asked what my accent was, even though I'm not even that Irish 👁️👄👁️
My granda has a thicker accent than frostbit lad
Wait how else are you supposed to say mirror?
Lol
look at  Richie Griffin's son pretending to understand what his father says
"Want to learn to speak in an Irish accent?"  "Which one?"  Not that you can't say the same thing about English/American.  Just that when someone says it's not an Irish accent, I think, are you sure, tho?
Review the accents from Peaky blinders, bc they’re mostly American and had to learn them
7:24 true
5:31 If I really concentrate, I can almost understand him - is it because I'm British and used to regional accents? XD
Jack: “I’m a vowel bender!”
No not 35 its 45 sheep
No matter what children are still watching every YouTuber got small amount of children
I understood the sheep farmer video in a way, but not when my brain is wired for English, but for Norwegian and thats kinda weird 😂😂
I’m Irish and those accents are HORRIFIC
Are all Irish schoolboys also 40 year old men? 😂
Tàim ag foghlaim Gaelige
Say "irish wrist-watch" in irish accent.😏 I challenge you! Just try it ;-)
In my theatre voice and diction class, i studied some of these clips and practiced on some of them, but when it came to my Irish Dialect monologue, I binge watched Jackcepticeye and got 100 (the highest grade in my class) on the final project
"Ya wold'nt belong getn' FROSTBUTT!"
Have you seen  Oliver Jackson-Cohen from Haunting of Bly Manor? This british guy fooled me not once but twice with his range of accents. I feel like he did a really good Irish accent in that show!
Im not irish but i live in Ireland for about 10 years now
How to do an irish accent  Step 1: grab a pint...
The Irish farmer sounds like he speaking gibberish
swedish nr7
K so that one with the sheep's... I only understood it when it was like... Really quiet and I just listened to it
The voice coach sounds a teeny bit like CallMeKevin! I think she has some of it right. Just some of it.
Americans trying to understand any accent from the UK is so funny to me. I'm Bristolian and I relate to this video so much XD
Try talking to an Irishman who’s first language is Gaelic 😬
11:16 the shittiest of the benders in avatar
person who lost his sheep: mergolna chernop glemashep! me: wait what?
The Irish shepherd sounds like he is talking German, except it isn't German xD
Irish people aren't a different breed, they're a different race.
0:23 WHAT! how can the swedish accent be at place 7 as a sexy accent??! Have you ever heard the swedish accent?! 😍😍😍
I think it's the combination of MUMBLING and the accent that makes it hard to understand. Funny enough, as a Swedish person I kinda understand some of the more "rough" irish accent and scottish accent. Might be because they have some norse in some accents xD But we have some accents in Sweden that makes me question we speak the same language xD
jack didn't recognise the rubberbandits :(
It's interesting to see all the dialects from each region and it's the same here in Newfoundland. We are a melting pot of mostly Irish, English and French words that have somehow been blended together. There's a lot in common with Ireland especially our sense of humor. :D
As a peasant American, the first time I heard “haitch” and “zed” was watching Seán. Also the first tilde used in a name, outside of Spanish. I was so uncultured. Thank you Mr. Spring.
the had subtitles and i still didn't understand a word he said...smh
5:13 i think I just got sharpness 5
Flir instead of flour wut never heard of that
when your from Kerry and have a really strong irish accent.... 👁👄👁   thanks Jack...
Thing is, I get the whole Irish accent thing because me being English apparently means I'm meant to be from London speaking in Cockny slang xD I'm from Fleetwood, Lancashire, in the North West of England, where we speak really quickly and husky with Northern words and all, and I move to Shrewsbury in the West Midlands and no one could fucking understand a single word I said because I have a thick accent. I was asked numerous times if I was Scottish. So I had to slow down my speech and go higher in octave to be understood, to only be stopped half sentence because I used a Northern Localism and had to translate wtf I just said. xD
Dude honestly even tho the Christopher Walken movie had horrible accents low key kinda looks like a good movie Also I think this video shows that only Irish people can really understand fucking heavy accents XD
imagine every russian, german, italian person complaining of bad accents and stuff in the million other movies that exist ;-P
“You’re lucky you’re gorgeous.”   If I had a dollar for every time I’ve been told this, I would be turned away from the Dollar Tree at the door.
Oh my god, Jack should watch the Irish movie, "RAT."
Jack I’m Scottish don’t say that about my country
If u do come to Ireland come to meath to see Newgrange because I live right beside it
Oh way down south in the land of traders rattle snakes and SPUDS
Not gonna lie, I'm gonna continue exploring this accent. You've piqued my interest, Seàn!🍀
Do you know Niall Horan
“Eat shit France”
Jack sying the world "miror"      "Mirrrrrr
0:26 You stopped yourself at Australian g o o d. if you would have said something about my Australian accent I would probably.... stayed a subscriber :l            (goddammit seán. 😆)
South Africa is also there
I’ve watched jack so much that I don’t even realize he has an accent sometimes
You should do a video about Derry girls
TIL flower = FLÆR
The lads from skibbereen I've met them as im from there aswell
If you think the Irish accent can be hard to understand try listening to Somerset accents
"Not time as in I'm late for a meeting, thyme as in the HERb."
Me having a Scottish-ish accent: 🥲
the town county thing is the same with english too, you either get the queens english or some form of cockney when people not from england try to do the accent, being from the west midlands our acents vary from fairly posh to so farmery its like trying to understand the irish sheep farmer
Says my ould one to your ould one...
Go on the Irish TIPP TIPP TIPP TIPP
OUR LANGUAGE IS THE SEXIEST?   not the commoners-
You should watch Wolfwalkers by Irish studio Cartoon Saloon! It's based on Irish folklore! It has an Irish cast I believe
I may move to Ireland ._. I'm part after all
I think the sexiest irish accent was Seán's.
I miss the " TOP OFF THE MORNING" intro
At the start when sean was talking about non Irish people doing Irish accents why did my brain go tonthe unus annus video
20:04 is meant to be Blind Boy from The Rubberbandits, the cartoon man wasn't drawn with a Spar bag on his head for no reason lol. Surprised you didn't pick up on that.
frostBUTT.
This was class lol you should do a video on the accents in the North of Ireland just to see the difference and being from Belfast let me tell you our accents aren't as nice as Southern ones 😂
When is he going to play minecraft again
I read somewhere that Brad Pitt's accent was quite accurate
“I’m a vowel bender”
Take a trip back to Ireland your acccents lost its touch 😂😂
How have you so many followers?
Those people who try teach Irish accents online are usually the biggest eejits in the world.  They always feed into the la de ha de ha type crap but very subtly
At first, I wasn’t really paying attention to the sheep farmer man, then when I decided to pay attention and comprehend...I barely understood full sentences. I picked up a few words at a time and put the sentences together amd waited on Sean to explain what he really said. I was somewhat close about the dog sentence.
The every day Irish person
My Irish friend and I watched the one about the stolen sheep together and she had no idea what was going on. We had a good laugh though lmao.
the irish hit diff tbh
2 DaYs AgO
Can understand from a southern USA perspective, when people do what they think is a "southern accent" its just all over the place when a "southern" accent can change just from a region within a state, sometimes changing from county to county. We always know when someone is faking it lol
I met an irish girl years ago in an island in Greece, we tried to talk in the club and it was so hard for me to understand wtf she was saying sometimes, I couldn't even understand her name so she just added herself from my phone on FB. Out of desperation that I didn't want to seem like an idiot, I did the last line of defense I had, I started kissing her and the night went on this way. Next morning, when I woke up, I saw someone accepting me on FB, Aoife it said. 5 years later and I still have no idea how to pronounce this name at all. Havent talked since then either.
i thought spar was South African but it is also Irish, i cant believe this
Langers just fuckin got me
I tried so hard to understand, I feel like I have failed yous, and people say I sound Irish 😂😂
My mother lives in the town picture they showed for county Cork
TY for complementing me accent im dublinish
I'm Irish
I'm English but the entire side of my mum's family is Irish so I can understand the majority of the Irish accents quite well. I'm best at the cork and Limerick accent lmao
ahhh now, but what do ya think of the longford accent
he should listen to pintman
I want more of theeeeesseeee
WHAT THE FUCK JEFF
He should have watched some boondock saints and seen Norman Reedus do his Irish accent hahah
how about connor mcgregor ?
One day he’s just gonna have a pure Irish accent and we’re all just gonna be struggling to understand him the whole time, can’t wait
Had to say I'm here laughing it was a great video and jack you should have finished that one it's great at the end haha, ohh and also that guy from louth did sound abit odd but there's lots of different accents in louth specially dundalk and drogheda
I swear to fucking god jacks spontaneously just yelling and joy make my fuckin day-
Haven’t even started but if I don’t see Kerry cork or GALWAY ima kill someone
3:55 My _exact_ reaction, when listening to Dutch as a Norwegian 😂  (Also similar to British VS this scene)
“Start drinking more milk, bitch!” Best line of the video.
Why the fuck is Aussie only 5???!!!
Top ah da mernin to ya...lol this video had me laughing all the way through it.  Probably the best video I have seen from you to date. Not that any other was not good but this one was hilarious. PLEASE do more like this. Many thanks for the laughs bud.
This reminds me of unnus annus  when they try accents
Do you speak Gaelic Sean?
That irish lad with the sheeps missing, his southern irish accent is like skånska (southern swedish accent) in sweden. It can be so hard to translate for someone that speaks swedish but isnt from sweden.
The sheep guy sounds like my grandma speaking English with the strongest Icelandic accent
I got scared when Jack translated for Mad Accent guy. I specialize in speaking English, German, and Japanese. I could only pick out words, not sentences!
I wonder if hes ever listened to a Lurgan (a city in Ireland) accent, I live about 2 counties away from it and I still can't understand it
Brad didn't sound Irish it sounded like jacked up ausie
5:31 this is what jack sounds like when he was drunk   Really his sound look like jack
I watched the video "Guide to irish accents" in school in english class.
You should watch pixie it's an Irish film just come out with Alex Baldwin not a bad accent. It's a funny one so it is
damn i was close on 7:14 i thought he said all you need is a good rope and the will just walk with you didnt think it was dog
I understood like 3/4 of this.
Whenever I get off the phone with family, my husband is often shocked because my southern accent comes back without me realizing it. Takes a few minutes to shake it off.
What bout philippines?--
Jack the last vowelbender
But I am americam
Some of these guys sound like they have something in their mouths
“We don’t say top of the mornin, it’s cringy saying it” *names his whole ass coffee company ‘top of the mornin coffee’*

The Brad Pitt one from snatch was a Irish traveler gypsy accent that’s why jack was like it’s good but it’s not lol
Mirrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
I’m just surprised we Scottish accents made it third😳but we do fancy the Irish least I do😌

Hi
HOW!!!!!!!!!!
Holy GOD!!!! YOU watched to much of GlenROE>>>>>>>>>>> The Irish accents in this film  are so BAD back to drama school for them
The Irish accents really helps with SUBS ,it has for me :)
I laughing my ass off!!!! I'm Irish and this is brilliant 🤣🤣
As someone who goes to an international school with a lot of Irish students...ya I can barely understand some of them 😂
2:22 lmao he sounds like gru from despicable me
We need more videos like these every week
The amount I heard was just "it's bright out, beautiful morning anyone can go up on the mountains." the rest my brain could not process 😂
Jack: Laughing at something he said Me: Haha ha ha ...... ok
Shawn Mac'nCheese

Try listening to some Danish
I have friends online from all walks of Ireland. Ah sure the crack be grand Bai. Love them all in their own odd way 😉
These people sound like they're speaking German
Lemme guess country was on the very bottom? 0:27
Wait, hold up.... there's spars in Ireland!?!?!? I thought they were a south African thing!
CallMeKevin flashbacks intensify
I'm from Brighton uk and my nan is from Cork, its easy to understand her normally until she get flusted.
Honestly Sean, you have the most un-irish sounding accent when speaking on youtube, even my own mother doesn't believe you are irish. Do not take this as an attack on your heritage or anything. I am just stating the facts.
You know that wired video with that dialect coach? Jack should parody them and just focus on the Irish accent
surprisingly i understood that, it would however take a couple of times repeatedly listening to it b4 i could repeat it back to u though
12:14 it's the same with British accents. Which one? The queen's accent? London? Manchester? Birmingham? I'll stop before I list every place but you get it.
His face immediately as soon as he sees an American teaching people how to do an Irish accent. That face hit my lil irish soul
all i understood from the farmer was there is 45 sheep missing xD
Found out my family came from from county Kerry when they came to America good to know if I ever met the relatives still there I wouldn't understand shit they say. 😂
That last video was so fcking funny 😂😂
What did he SAYYY
5:32 me trying to speak chinese
I cringe when non Aussies do an Australian accent because they make us sound like bogans. Which are the full on what everyone thinks we sound like but really it’s usually not that strong of an accent.
the Irish farm video I understood its actually interesting the heavy the accent is but then again I think there is like several irish diffrent dialect depending on what part of the country you are in. like native american there is several dialects and language  depending in which tribe you are from.
The Brad Pitt one was literally described in the movie as not Irish and not English it's something different
Jack youre getting a bit of grey hair my man getting old
Irish people are the feccin' best, ye just gettah chug down de old gargle n' have a wee dittah crack.
How about the movie black 47 it takes place in Ireland and I wonder how you think about their accents
Me, an Italian: *cries pasta water*
Brad Pitt wasn't playing an irishman in snatch he was playing a gypsy, thats how he gets away with that accent
As a person who's first language ISN'T english i understood absolutely NOTHING!
Jack. Jack I need a reaction vid to the last one. I creased at the Spar bag comment :D
I felt exposed when he said “start drinking more milk bitch!” since I still drink milk to go to bed 👁💧👄💧👁
Can you make a video listening to Irish celebrities!!!!!!!!!!!!
I think everyone who isn’t from England or America have to suffer hearing bad accents in movies. I still remember Robert Downey Jr trying to be Australian in Natural Born Killers.
That farmer sounds almost the same as Nogla
anyone seen the video with the irishman that can't find his soup ? Fucking hilarious.
He should do this for the Australian accent lol
I feel like Denmark is kind of like Ireland. All of this just reminds me of Denmark idk.
Irish rower to non-Irish people: oidvoiwunvuihw9üvocnvapv Séan: What a legend!
That "Th" sound the T makes is a very familiar sound we have in groningen in the north of the Netherlands. We call it "a wet T" (Een natte T)
I love that with extremely heavy Irish accents, my brain just registers the speech as noise with absolutely nothing distinguishable but I can also understand what's being said haha. The unexpected benefit of watching you and Kevin so much I guess hahahahaha
See I would make fun of you all but my Aussie accent isn’t any better😂 it’s a bit scary that I understand this
Do the Irish not know you open your lips to talk?
Its mad when irish people dont use subtitles for that farmer...
Ireland- every town has its own accent and dialect England- every village has its own accent  and dialect
I like how Jack trying to do an Irish accent with his Irish accent just sounds like some random New Yorker.
Damn at 2:23 jack sounds like grew from despicable me
Caravan road trip!
I’m from Dublin.......Dublin,CA. It’s actually Dublin Ireland’s sister city.
Holy shit i actually watched that how to do an irish accent video when i was trying to learn how to do one for a voice acting audition. weird seeing it here several years later
all world: coronavirus, debates, shooting on the streets  ireland: Mr. Sean lost 45 sheeps
I have the 5 sexiest Accents
I was giggling so much that my best friend(boy) kissed me 😂😂i love that video
As a fellow irish person I understood that farmer even though that accent was insane
It all sounds Scottish
what about "sing street"? huh?
Could anyone else pick up a few words with the intense accents? Or am I just a dork...? It’s the latter option? *Alright.*
i mean... that call in unus annus....
I can't really say if I find the Irish accent sexy because I still have family that lives over there.
Irish accents are really really damn sexy. I was gonna say imagine someone with an irish accent whispering to you in your ear but I started gigling because I imagined them saying a joke, which I forgot as soon as I thought of it. I wish I had an Irish accent(Even though I have no Irish in my blood whatsoever, only Aboriginal, welsh, scottish aand of course I can't forget my viking ancestry) but sadly I have an Aussie accent which is pretty cool. Sorry for typing so much.
Love it how Australian is 5th and he avoids it quickly, like nah I ain't dealin with that lmao
Is it just me or am I understanding the thicker accents the longer I listen to it?
Why don't you just go back to your own channel
16:31 if anyone didn't get this Bandon is a town in Cork
Ooohhh It’s Christian Grey/Jaime Dornan......he doesn’t need to sound Irish(even though he is), He just needs to be.
Sean: *Ah irish people are just a different breed* Me: *😂*
I was supposed to go to Ireland this year....and then COVID happened. So, supposed to go next year. Who knows.
I'm from England and I want to see if I'm right before jack translates. at 6:41 I think the man says "Its not all that difficult.  All you gotta do is have a good dog, ...have a good dog and moon full night just with the dog around um, bit of a march and then you'll walk um."  tell me if I'm right
These accents are hard but gotta say it ain't no cajun
SÉAN STUDIED IN LIMERICK WHY DIDN'T I RAID HIS FUCKIN HOUSE... it's scary how much the dude from the guide to irish accents got limerick too perfect
I think there Cork accent is fine (probably because I'm from here
Actually you're wrong Sean, if you google 'most sexiest accent in the world' you'll get the kiwi accent
I thought he said "Frostbutt"
Dia dhuit Jack, an bhfuil aon scéal agat?
I'm from limerick which is in southern ireland and to anyone thinkin we all have the same accent every single county has a totally different accent it's the worst thing ever for anyone with social problems cause alot of ppl mumble so you just say "yeah" next thing you know is you're a male Stripper..love you séan! The content is amazing so glad I'm irish and i can understand the stupid af jokes abt Ireland you make
Jack if I'm being honest your Irish accent doesn't sound that strong, like I can tell you are Irish but is a lot softer to most Irish accents I've heard through my life.
I loved this vid
Not gunna like brad pitt's accent is spot on cause it's meant to be a gypsy irish accent to and they do talk like that lol
the Irish accent is a bit like New Zealanders accents it changes to every region of the country that's cool in New Zealand you can have the hillbilly accent of the towny accent
Sean's accent is the best of all
What rhe kinda website is that
OMG ANG was air bending words dammmmmmm
watching a irishman laughing at irishmen talking then translating whats spoken and laughing that he has to translate, now thats a video worth watching ..... LOL
Sean does a better christopher walken impression than christopher walken does an irish accent
Never had a good laugh before but then you got me @10:00 😂
Can I just say the accents in the first video sounded more Scottish than Irish
Stop stealing his sheep 😔
0:25 Ya see that he skipped Insulting Australia he secretly loves us
Im aware its been three years since your playthrough of act 1- And idk if youll see this (and I know everyone will hate me lmao)- HOWEVER-   HIVESWAP ACT 2!! Its coming out soon! You gotta play it!
The Pikey accent for Brad Pitt was created for the movie because he was unable to do a London accent. It's not supposed to be from any particular place that's why there's the quote in the film "it's not Irish, it's not English, well it's just Pikey"
WHAT the Feck Jeff
I'm from hillbilly central and i understood every single one of the people XD
I live near where the farmer lost hid sheep its  hard  to understand what he says most of the time anyway even tho in irish
Jack: "I'm a vowel-bender" Me, a linguist: "Is that a challenge, mate?"
I’m very proud to say that (coming from England) I could understand the rowers
Mirrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
For a second I thought this said "Bad BRI'ISH ACCENTS That Even I can't Understand"
The rest of the world: we’re all dying.  Ireland: Sean is missin 45 sheep!
10:55  *USA: "DID SOMEONE SAID OIL!? OILAND???"*
Wow,Sean really has changed a lot physcly
Tha last video was fuckin gas 😂😂😂
i thouroughly enjoyed this🤣👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
i— can’t understand the farmer
Michael j fox
20:00 when jack pauses the video the irish guy goes "ni-"
italian is considered sexy??? wHERE
The farmer sounds like he’s speaking an entirely different language 😅
That farmer's accent is the Southern accent of the Irish world.
Jack's a simp for Brad Pitt
I've actually started pronouncing some words like Jack. I think my mind's being influenced by the irish.
if it weren't for seán translating some of these accents i would have had NO IDEA what they were saying
Sheep Farmer: *Says words(?)* Me: *Confused Screaming*
Watching auto subs trying to understand this is amazing
The Irish schoolboy just sounds like he has a THICK Newfie accent, it's insane lmaoooo
Ahre whe shur Hehs not jus speaken gaelic?
Is that how you sound in your videos? Nah man, you're like an Irish Gilbert Gottfried
At least aussie is number 5 and I’m aussie
As a southerner, those sheep farmers made perfect sense.
do a video with niall horan please im begging you
7:15  no one:  irish people: my last name starts with a lower case
lol america isn’t even there
Next vid pls: cringe TikToks
Jacksepticeye's most most irish video
Sean mac and cheese
With that Mad Accent video half of it sounded like Irish Gaelic because who needs English
The VERY end. THE VERY END GOT ME.
I love being irish :)
vowel bender that got my like
I rlly want to know where Jack's family is from, my family is from Newcastle County-Down so I hope he's from that area too.
Nobody: England at any given time: Ha ha eat shit, France.
"I'm a vowel bender" ~ spits drink in laughter.  I don't know why I laughed as hard as I did. xD
9:07 Irish Ethan
This is what I hear when I read Irish Twitter
Ok but can we talk about that one guy from the movie Brave that literally no one can understand
I'm just happy I understood at least half of the real accents without translations. xD
I loved this! 😂 I'm so glad I can finally track my ancestry back to my two loved cultures, I found some ancestors that can be mapped back to Ireland and Native American, specifically Navajo and Pueblos. I have always loved an Irish accent and I would love to move there one day, it's beautiful.
Imagine blinking your flashlight in GTFO and screwing over your entire squad
Sean make a video where you try to drop your accent for the entire video. Please. I’ve asked like every YouTuber I know 😭
....  Brad Pitt totally missed it lmao!!! it didn't sound english, it was like he was conjouring sum shyte
I wish I had a Irish accent with my Irish blood :(
My great uncle has a hard to understand Irish accent. My family tells me cause he used to live up in the hills with some older people or something and that's why his accent was so different, but when I went over a few years ago and I required someone like one of my cousins/great aunts to translate cause I couldnt even understand the man. Bad news, is some of them couldnt understand him either as it was like he spoke his own dialect
i can understand the farmer, but it wasnt the subtitles I've had on
Dude let me be reborn in a different country I’m tired of my American accent give me something to spice it up
I studied gaelic and don’t understand a word he said other than sheep and lamb
You should check out Shetland dialect 😉
The key to an Irish accent is being drunk.
I actually understood the farmer's mad accent! I have no fucking clue how, I'm Australian and we have the broadest, most drawn out dialect ever, but I got most of it.
it sounds like he said frostbutt
I had my captions on and it didn’t make sense to me lol
my dads fully Irish and when hes drunk he has a accent...I don’t but me and my family will always like laugh at how he says ice cream because he says it like “I scream” and its so funny and I wanted to know if you say it like that
Where are you from? Sorry, I am new to your channel, I didn’t mean for that to sound rude so sorry if it did!♥️
I wonder how you'd like the newfoundland accent it's Canada's irish accent
19:20 it’s sounded like he said “kickn’ and shovin’ chickens and shoving” something “up them” 😂😂😂
I would recommend a certain video, but sadly it doesn't exist anymore :(
The one from cork, she sounded like she was done with their shit before she met them like 😭
Lol I just saw that Australian was 5th... Hahahahaha yeah nah mate!!! 😂
I love me a good accent, the challenge of understanding is a good fun game dontcha think? I used to delve deep into accents for the fun of it, it is not to be anywhere near disrespectful but I feel like to understand what some people are saying you kinda have to get into the phonetics of the particular accent.
Hi   ... Read more
I feel like I can translate for southeastern Americans the way Jack translates for these farmers.
I'm American... Help
Im Bengkulu in Indonesia and... I dont understand that acent😌 AND MY ENGLISH IS BADD AS HELL
Oh your from Ireland?? I think ya mean oiland!
That was brilliant.  Check out Cajun accents when ya get the chance.  The further south, the harder it is to understand em.  Great fun!
“I don’t find Irish accents sexy” Seán: WHAT THE FUCK JEFF!
it was a challenge but i could understand the farmer guy. im really good at understanding people through accents so that it was rough goes to show how insane it is. ive only ever failed once, and that with rural newfoundlanders who talk a lot like that farmer guy except with like 70% more slang
I wouldn’t even have thought the sheep guy was speaking English 0.0
video: omegesh flaglesnifn de shartin jacksepticeye: OMG SO TRUE
No one:  Not even Jack:  Me:JACKSEPTICEYE MAN BUN?!?! 💘
I've tried committing to an Irish accent before but it certainly is tricky. I'm American and I want to become a voice actor as my career, so I always infatuate myself with different accents from around the world and since I have a bit of Irish blood in me, I always try and attempt the Irish accent to improve in that said accent. Since I now see that there, like in America, are different dialects in Ireland, it certainly makes for an interesting challenge to try and imitate the accent in different dialects within Ireland.  Of course, I don't wish to offend anyone by making a bad accent and seemingly mock people who have that accent.
I love the fact you mentioned my favorite movie hot fuzz
Those funny iris roars
I suddenly understand all of Ireland
This looks as painful as when Americans or anyone tbh tries to do an Aussie accent😂🇦🇺
Holy. Jesus. Christ. This. Made. Me. Feel. Physical. PAIN!!!  (but I also feel seen thank you Seán)
5:35 this is what my grandparents sounded like.
imagine not being a part of the 57.1% of his viewers
i tried to like this vidya twice
I'm of Irish decent, and I don't understand why the Irish accent is so hard to do... ;_; I guess it's because it varies so much from county to county.
It's not the first time Brad Pritt did an Irish accent he did one in Devil's Own
Why does his hair look so grey tho
Pretty sure the guy wearing the plastic bag may have been a reference to the rubber bandits since it’s their gimmick in their music
That's just silly. Brad Pitt is not Irish in Snatch, he is Gypsy.
Teach us how to do an accent
My ancestry is Italian, Scottish and French, soooooo...
I literally learn English whit your vids, duoligo who, greeneyelingo
this is me trying to understand the quebecois
No. Those farmin’ motherfuckers were speaking German and there’s nothing you can tell me that will convince me otherwise
The old man sounds like he’s speaking old English
This is actually the best
Please do more like this. I can't stop laughing lol
Your wan from Kerry DIDN'T have a Kerry accent 😂
That is the first time I’ve heard this THICC of an accent
If he can I wanna see Jack actually speak Irish Gaelic lol
we gonna ignore the fact that they called a shepard a sheep farmer
sean you silly man, that's Seán Mac and Sit Thigh
I swear the sheep guy sounded like he was speaking Russian
What’s funny is I’m not even from Ireland but my family is from Ireland and I couldn’t understand the hard to understand accents lol what’s that say about me?
Seán mocking Christopher walken, sounds like arnold shawrswhatshisname. And I can’t unhear it
The beauty of accents is no matter the accent and stereotype of said accent we all of to make fun of bad ones
My fake accent is somewhere between irishand scottish. I'm certain if i met someone of either ethnicity they'd say it's awful. I do a pretty good russian accent tho.
lol
irish accents might as well be a different language
Thank you for not saying anything about the Australian accent
Everyone ragging on our Cork boy Kevin
5:31 He's... speaking Irish, right? Like, there's no way he's speaking English and that's *just* his accent.
LMAO When he realized she was american trying to teach people how to sound Irish.
Lol I'm an American from the South, but my family says mirror almost exactly like Sean did here. 😂
21:05 I think your accent is my favourite! 🙃
Sean can you please react to Newfie accents, some people in town can’t understand people from around the bay 😂
Australia is 5th sexiest accent? He’ll ye
Incorrect. The sexiest accent is Corpse
I love the movie snatch
Well now jack she said an Irish accent not thr
I was taken on holiday to go cruise around Britain/Ireland/Scotland in 2013. We docked in Cobh and I straight up couldn't understand a word the women behind the counter in the tourist shop was saying. I felt so bad I couldn't understand her but holy cow was it cool!
I live in Newfoundland and Labrador, where there is heavy Irish influence in the accent. After almost 20 years living here, you’d think I’d be able to understand the accent. Well, you’d be wrong there.  Edit: I understood 6:40, so apparently my brain is just backwards
What got me is that Australian accent's are considered fifth in that list.  Ya'll clearly have never heard all of our cursed dialects XD
My God, that's fun!
I mean, if you have Christopher Walken play any other character than Christopher Walken, you've kinda failed at film making
Man a lot of actors can’t do Irish & southern American accents. I’m from the south & I haven’t heard one good one. 😂
surely...Surely Sean the shepherd wasnt speaking English- maybe that's irish, the language, and sean just forgets that it's not english....
This is how I feel watching people try to do a southern accent as someone who's Texan
This is the closest we'l ever get to a new Jacksepticeye's Funniest Home Videos.
For some reason, I get daily words in my email.  Today was "craic" and I immediately went to Jack's video on Irish slang.
Your reaction to Brad Pitt means he nailed it. Kinda like what Statham's narration says - "You can't really understand much of what's bein said. It's not Irish. It's not English. It's just, well.....it's just Pikey."
I fucking lost it when Sean had to translate and when he said the frostbit part holy shit, that part sent me
you should try and listen to some of the heavier Cajun accents most people cant understand them but since im from southern Louisianan its sounds normal
HECKA GREY HAIRR
Visited limerick and when the waitress came up and said, “how are ye today?” my heart melted haha.
This was fun! Wholesome!
11:15 Sean is the ultimate bender
I don't think brad pitt managed ANY language there....
*NOOOGGLA*
This is almost as bad as watching Americans trying to do an Australian accent in movies
the kid talkin about about frostbite gave me thick rural Minnesotan vibes
I'm currently studying to be an English Translator and this is so interesting to me!!  PLEASE MAKE A PART 2 JACK
I’ll have u know that I’m all ready in bead drinking milk
You should do northern Irish accents haha the Belfast accent is fuckin hideous 😂😂
Never do away with your accent. You will regret it. Also don't go full irish like the farmers because those videos will not do well with captions 😁
"When people imitate me they go:" *sounds exactly the same as always even though he thinks he's doing an accent.* Uuuuhhhh Jack-a-boy I don't know how to tell you this...
Another one that is really really really bad, is in sons of anarchy. It's a Northern Irish accent, but it is the worst I've ever seen 😂😂.
Oh, Jackaboy. Your accent is very light. I’ve never struggled to understand you.
Man, Sean's really got that Cork accent spot on. It's almost like he practices every day
I think Brad Pitt was speaking in middle english XD
Sorry but scottish accents are my favorite
I was kinda hoping he would look into Boondock Saints  with Norman Reedus and Sean Patrick  Flanery
the fella with the spar bag is a rubberbandit
Maybe it's me being from Kerry, but I have no problem understanding the sheep farmer
i didnt understand a fucking THING he said. 5:00
Nobody:    Sean: HERB
I’m so happy you mentioned hot fuzz haha just them saying seamine lol
I’m crying this video is so funny!
Irish accent in Snatch was hard to understand on purpose, throughout the movie they emphasise how the gypsies are hard to understand
I thought the farmer was talking gibberish omg
I'm from Galway and I've seen that farmer video plenty of times and could only understand a few words here and there so it was nice to finally get a full translation
Ever considered getting nice open back headphones, Jack?
Hello jack
Irish and Scottish accents are... very good
Through listening to accents being explained and the linguistics and examples, I could pick out some of what the farmer was saying but going back over it is clear as day once Sean translated by brain was like, 'well of course that's what he's saying, it's obvious!'
This was really fucking funny! Please make a part 2 or collab with other strong accented people and react to their countries accents.
I had a substitute teacher and he has Irish such a strong Irish accent and I loved it
Being irish but not having the accent is a nightmare, my friends and I just gave up trying to say I dont have an accent and just say I'm from wherever they think I'm from.
You doing that impression of yourself at 7:51 is just accurate.  XD
Sean, you had me in stitches! This is hilarious!
Almost sounds Japanese
Foil, Arms and Hog do a wonderful sketch about accents, and they seem vaguely possibly accurate.
At least the mostly widely known movie about your culture isn't The Waterboy.
I never thought I'd live to see Walken trying to do an Irish accent
You have a lovely accent, Jack. Very easy to understand 😂 love this
i’m from Maine State in The USA and I can understand these guys almost perfectly idk
I need him to react to our Welsh Accents so bad!!!
Your accent is the best sean!
this is me when I watch people do Jamaican accents😅
If you want to watch an amazing Irish movie watch pixie
His impression of himself sounds like himself but higher pitch and it’s hilarious!
it sounds like she's castig a signal with that flour
Irish=flower  Her=FLEUR
y bid she buch the irsh the Kerry accent
Literally Irish accents are just country Brogue Jamaican accents. We island people have a specific way of pronouncing words. Take a Filipino farmer, a Irish farmer and a Jamaican farmer and put them in the room together and I can guarantee it wouldn't sound like English lol.
I'm Irish and I can only understand some of the 3rd clip of "Irish accents "
Okay but I'm from *Oklahoma* and I could understand all of these perfectly fine 😂
What happened to the wpshhh
The kid wafning about frostbite sounded like he was talking backwards
Frauwist butt
When people ask irish people to say “top o the morning” it’s like asking Scottish people to say “och aye the noo” 😂😂😂
5:50 The guy has more accent then he does language.
aayy I form Kerry it great
Wait is his hair going gray or is it just me?
Vote JSE this election for a chance to get your ears blown off by Sean himself!!!
20:00 ish, is that meant to be blind boy..?
Having your stock stolen is super disheartening. Really feel for the bloke
I somehow understood all of that. Am I a some sort of god?
I heard "up in deh mountaynz" ... but that's all I understood lol
To be fair to Brad Pitt, the characters outrageous accent was a deliberate thing for comedy.
I have come to the conclusion...that a really *"TICC"* Irish accent is akin to a really heavy Southern accent.  Not the Southern _drawl,_ (think McConnahey(sp?!)), but more like _Boonhower_ from "King of the Hill."  I've lived in Texas all my life, but there are some people I just _cannot_ understand.
Reminds me of when Ender's Game came out and sir Ben Kingsley tried doing a NZ accent. Sounded mostly south African/Australian
Scotland, wails and Ireland are on a whole other level of lack
I'm irish
Oh, the sweet dulcet tones of Skellige.
“Watt dees teh dee?“ “wensdeeh” “Ah! sheer thooght it wes thersdee”
Do the one Niall Horan video no one can understand
Me there now ragen there was Nothing about offaly accent
14:51 - Pretty sure that's the same with any accent... People can just talk too fast.
ì love it when you do irish themed content, it really brings out your accent and it's so fun to watch. feels like we're just having bants in the pub
Me a County Down man as soon as the video was about to do a north accent but then he stops it 😑
MOORE
I love how am 50% Irish and don’t have a accent, I know that I was born and raised in America... I just wanted to be sexy
Yad know you were from offaly with that midlands accent , i can relate to that "Mirrrrrirrrr" (mirror) 🤣🤣
madeleine harvey (the lady teaching how to do an irish accent) is actually a wonderful vocal coach ngl
As a Welsh boi, you can pinpoint accents to the village with us. It's mad
I’m from Northern Ireland but for some reason when I talk to Americans they say I’m Irish and the don’t understand that I’m not from Ireland itself 😂
A whole video on Irish accents, and all i took from it was the fact that he knows what Spar is🤣🤣
I kept thinking about Hot Fuzz as well when Jack was repeating what the farmer said lol  Also I've always wanted to go to Ireland and now this just makes me want to go there even more 😂
Jamie Dornan is Irish tho 👀😂😂😂
Ok BUT have you heard a strong Welsh accent? 😅 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿
We're basically just a crap england
Omfl I'm from cork and we have a teacher from wexford and when I say I hate her accent I mean I HATE it.
I’m actually really proud of myself as a non-Irish person for understanding the farmer
When you understand irish accents bc you’ve been a directioner for 8 years and you speak Niall 😳
jack watching wild mountain thyme jack : HA HA NOT IRISH
Seán i think your accent is the best one
You do Jack but it was more so in the past lol
Those Southern lads remind me of my province in Belgium, we've got the strongest Dutch accent, so we sound like them rowers in the video to other Dutch people. You're girlfriend would certainly confirm that
Milk Gang
should do a Singapore accent (SInglish) video :D
I wish people were as passionate about accurately representing minorities in film as they were about accurately representing different accents 🙂
Oh shit does he not say top of the morning anymore?
I'm only half irish and I've lived in england my entire life, only ever been to Ireland once when I was 5ish. However, my irish family is all from cork so I have no problem understanding most(the Olympic ones definitely tripped me up)of these accents
As a Scottish lady I must say I love a Irish accent xD Honestly though irish accents are just lovely to listen to. Hence my habit of watching irish youtubers- so soothing to the ear. Unlike Scottish accents which is just people yelling 😂
13:08  Sean: *sees another Irish person  Sean: *IRISH INTENSIFIES
I never thought other countires had Spar..  The word means to save money in norwegian so I thought it was exclusive to us..
8:30 lol I’m at the same school as him
Watching this reminds me of the moment I fully believed that I have Irish ancestors...   My mom ordered a pint of ice cream...  But she said "pint" with an Irish accent...  I had never heard her say that word before, so I thought she was joking...   But she had NO idea she was saying it with an accent...  Then the next time I went to visit my Grandma, I asked her to say it (without saying it myself, of course) and SHE did it too!!!  It's funny how heritage can show up in the weirdest places...   Unfortunately, now that I pointed it out, they no longer say it with an accent...   It's a shame...
So "top of the morning" is the Irish version of "throw a shrimp on the barbie" from Australia, we really have a problem with that saying. Good to know, since I was planning on going to Ireland at some point.
Yo Sean, idea for a future video, compare the craziest Irish accents speaking English to Slavic and German people speaking English
Wasn't the "I don't care" at 1:59 more like a scottish accent? I'm not good at accents and I dont live in Scotland or Ireland, I could be totally wrong.
don't think i've laughed this much in a very long time, fantastic video 😂
I live in Australia but I come from what you could call the most stereotypical family. The majority of us have some sort of Irish accent just 2 people drink $400 of beer a week we can also drink 36 cans in one sitting and still go upstairs have dinner and go to bed. We almost always have fights or arguments at a gathering my grandmother was raised in the pub. My great great grandad had 9 kids and he was from Belfast and we practically live on whiskey rum potato’s and stew. Ireland the great couldn’t get better
Irish accent is to English, what the Swiss accent is to German :D
The Irish accent is build different, the Ulster accent and Kerry accent is just build even more different to the rest of the accents in the country
De best part o de Irish accent is ya got so many flaevers.
Unpopular opinion, I prefer the razor sharp Scottish accent myself.
I miss my home village back in Co. Armagh :( this just made me miss it more <3
Yera shur tis all sauce i spose notin but a bit a craic AN DTUIGEANN TÚ A CHARA?
Petition for Jack to sing “Kinky Boots”
pls i hear gibberish,  even if its english. IM SO GLAD OF SEAN,  HES TRANSLATING FOR ME AND OTHER PEOPLE WHO ARE STRUGGLING.
me: *unmutes right before starting the video* the sound: *is all the way up* me: WAIT Seán: *THE IRISH ACCENT IS AN ELUSIVE THING*
Me from stab city bein like hope he responds to Limerick
i love that when America makes fun of "Canadian accents" its always actually a fucking Minnesotan accent. check yourself murica
I KINDA UNDERSTOOD THE ACCENT IND IM DUTCH OH SHIIIIIIIIIIIIIT CAPSLOCK IS STILL on OOPS
This is a how a person from West jutland reacts whenever a person from copenhagen tries to copy our accent 😅 Also they dont understand US at all 🙄
I'm addicted to the Try Channel from Dublin. Please, Seán, work with them.
Me and my friend are Irish. Hes got a bit of an accent and then theres me, the Australian sounding muffinhead
My nan has an insanely strong Irish accent and I never have a CLUE what she's saying so I just look at her and nod ocasionally.
I want more of this it was fun
vocal coach: go ahead and try to say "park" and "garden" in an Irish accent!! jack: park. garden. I'm great at this!!
"The Irish Accent Voted Sexiest In The World"    .... by *Irish Around The World*
2:23 sounds like gru from dispecable me
Lol he was trying to speak Irish but he is Irish and already has a Irish accent XD tbh he's amazing
i could watch this video for literal hours
I'm from the USA specifically the midwest... didnt realize how close a midwest accent gets to some irish accents.  Ask a middle aged mom from Wisconsin what she wants at Culver's and youd understand lol
I'm probably one of the small amount that understood due to Irish family. That woman mind! 😂  and I love that cartoon video, I have shown people that one to help them understand.
Jack saying “top of the morning to ya laddies” in every video for like 9 years in the most exaggerated Irish accent possible definitely hasn’t helped our cause...
I feel the same way about movies where people attempt South African accents... It's impossible to get it right if you aren't South African XD
Is it weird I clearly understand what the sheep farmers accent and it didnt seem weird.
wats okkorin?
Frostbite accent is an Northern Irish accent.  It was gonna be covered in the video guide but Jack didn't watch it. :(  I guess because we are a seperate country. He was only covering South accents
That Brad Pitt one sounds Scottish a little but atleast
That one
the farmer sounded german for a second there lol...
did that guy get his sheep back tho?
jack come on tour after covid around ireland !!!!
I think I’ve watched that graham norton interview of the O’Donovan brothers so many times that I can kind of understand them now 😂😂
It says in snatch it’s a ‘pikey’ accent that doesn’t sound quite Irish. 😂😂
The one with the rowers is basically how the whole of my mum’s family talks lol
im irish and it was a struggle to understand
Any irish people
Marketeen tactic: BUY JACK/SEAN COFFE
Hey jack, look into southern american accents next, you'll get a hardy laugh
I am irish and these are complete shite
F can't understand him
Sorry this is random but 2:22 CHRISTIAN GRAY 😍😍😍
19:20 - 19:28 Caaarck, gre *8*
you should include Northern Irish accents next time! It’d be really funny comparing them bc they’re pretty similar
Jack is me when I'm trying to talk to my family that live in Newfoundland. I live in Toronto with a normal city girl life and any time I talk to my mom's family the main things I say is "yes...uh...sure...OKAY" BECAUSE I CANT UNDERSTAND THEM  Fun face Newfoundland is mainly made up of Irish and Scottish settlers hence why they sound similar to true Irish and Scottish citizens.....
Jack, your Sans is showing
no one gonna point out how our irish boy has grey hairs 🥺😭💔
Bro I love the Hot Fuzz reference
2:22 Arnold? Is that you?
As a non english native speaker, i still dont understand how i understood the student one (and sometimes some other sentences from the other video lmaooo)
I actually understand his accent
Where is Jack?
Pitt's accent in Snatch was horrible.  Good thing Statham just played straight with his natural South London accent to counteract Pitt.
and i thought i couldn't understand a drunk Scot but the Irish jesus
Farty five had me dying
i couldn't understand richie until i realised he was talking about a dog and then suddenly everything was immediately clear when i heard him again im from kildare
No you don’t sound like a leprechaun
mr. joe gilgun in preacher is english accented but his irish accent is perfect.
How about you try a Scottish accent. Like Scrooge McDuck?
As a Cork man myself I must say I have no accent
best irish accent is county cavan nothin else
they sound like their possessed
The real shame is being south dublin so you can’t do a stereo type accent and everyone thinks your American
the sheep guy has a irish accent and is mumbling with a lisp
I’m Irish and I can’t even understand the farmer
hiii guys  ! Who else is trying to grow their YT channel during quarantine. Let’s help one another. Much Love
You should hear my grandpa's Irish accent when he has only a few teeth left
I’m Irish and I can’t understand a word of that farmer
what the fuck was that kerry accent
The hot fuzz Scene is exactly this
i would love to see someone without and Irish accent preform a HEAVY Kerry accent
No favourites, all are absolutely amazing, just do more of these. I haven't laughed so hard in way too long. xD
Jacksepticeye's accent is my favorite
I was hoping to see that old man in a bar on an interview! that was insane
She is British
jack you should see if you can understand Scots since the accents are so similar
Rowers: "evskepbabaptrpoya a couple a hours der" Me: ??????? Sean: *cracks up* "fuckin' legend 😂"
PARK... GARDEN
How many sheep went missing? Farty Five?
I like your orange eyeliner
“Why didn’t they just hire actual Irish people?” Welcome to Hollywood baybeeee
Jack gotta react to Sminky Shorts. If u haven’t seen those vids and ur Irish, plz search you wont be disappointed
mine
what i hear from brad pit abecssh scootcheen ouffen lighched
As a Belgian, I understand your trouble. I can barely understand my own people either
the Oi from oil is not the same as the I from Irish lmao . it's somewhere in between AI and OI
I hate when people pretend to be Irish even though I'm half polish and half Irish but i live in Ireland
I could easily understand the rowers
Ah yes, Froshbutt.
The Irish Farmer reminds me of Welsh Shepherds, I guess the farmer type have their own accent that they all share.
Jack, if you wanna see Brad Pitt doing a Irish accent then you should watch: The Devil's Own. It's a amazing movie.
yes snatch is so funny XD
I would've lost my shit if the videos Jack was showing had an ad break.
2:36 where you paused the video it looks like the horse is going to faceplant real hard XD
i think the farmer is speaking gaelic
i laughed out loud when he said "hahaha eat shit france"
i come from cali so my "accent" is more of a laud back tone, but not like a surfer dude-bro accent like in a lot of beach themed movies (most people from cali dont even sound like that dksjsnekk)
12:37, Stonks.
I've been cursed with living in Laois so I, an Irish person, cannot do an Irish accent
Would you go for more, that's peak Irish times I'm not even Irish but I need more
The disrespect that the beginning was needed idk what y’all say
After studying German for a few years in school, sometimes the Irish accents are so thick that it sounds almost does like German.
i dont understand how do people not understand this
Ah sure just wait till ya see us speak Gaelic with an Irish accent
There’s no bright about to be going about the mountain at night maybe? Oh he translated it
I am Irish       But I do not have an accent
true, you got to narrow down where exactly your trying to mimic, the more specific the better
Thick accents where you can't understand the words are like the death metal logos of language
I might be more Irish than I thought. I didn't have that hard of a time understanding a few of them. That woman teaching Irish lost me though. Lol
Why did Jacksepticeye sound like Arnold Schwarzenegger on 2 minutes
you need to rewatch the Irish Farmer Loses Sheep video but with the auto-captions on...its the funniest thing ever because the captions are so so wrong
I went to Ireland once, four years ago, and it has been like the most amazing and touching experience that I could have done. Listening again to all these beautiful accents brought me back and made me laugh and cry of joy, so.. thank you Sean for this video, I really needed a trip back in time and memories 🥰☘️
Jack and what do we say about Donegal accents
as an irish cavan woman i was hoping sean would finally react or talk about our accents ahaha, oh well sure we'll get em next time
Hey I’m Italian
Imagine being latin and hear this.... wait im latin
Imagine being latin and hear this.... wait im latin
From a Scotsman to an Irishman. Fair is fair. The Irish accents are very lovely to hear.
What county in Ireland are you from i feel cork
American accent reveal at 26 million subscribers
I just want to say im irish and not all people in ireland speak like that farmer because some people in the comments are getting that idea😓
Ahh fuck you i never herd they way i say mirror now all im ginna hear is mirr (not a hatter) no wait mayo or limerick noo noo they cant speak irish down there idk reply if you see and want
That's all right seán McLaughlin, you had fun and it works in your favor, me on the other hand well, I'm just here for the laughs or should I say * thud * LAUGH, so we good.
You look so different now than 7 years ago when u were yeeting a ball for ur dog ;-; but u still look good 👌
you know you’re in trouble when somebody starts out a video saying they’re going to teach you how to do an irish accent as if there’s only one 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Ah sure you’re grand, I’ve been down this hole me self a number of times now
It troubles me that jack doesn’t know who the “Rubberbandits” are and just referred to your man as a lad with a spar bag and a knife 😢
19:12 Nogla? Is that you?
Surprised I understood that
Kevin couldn't even fully properly translate the sheep farmer if memory serves, so well done jack
No Belfast accent?
Seán: blah blah Scotland Me from Scotland: 😯😅😂
Irish person critiquing irish accents: When they know it isn't an irish person. "That sounds terrible! Get Irish actors"  When it is an irish person: "That sounds terrible! Are they really Irish?!  Or; "Do we really sound like that?!"
Let's go lads county louth lmao wait no I've never heard some one sounding like that
It sounds like backwards
Plsssssssssssss
Plsssssss notice meeeeeeeeee
You sound more like Chris Walken than Chris Walken
The first guys accent reminds me so much of strine!
Lmao English is 6th and I’m a Brit-
Ya! Wtf Jeff
The schoolboy sounded like the grinch 💀
I cracked up when he said “ya I’m a vowel bender!”
Saying "Lets do an Irish accent" is probably like "Lets do an American accent." Ok bro, you want Brooklyn? South? Deep South? Louisiana Creole? Californian Surfer? Midwesterner? Minnesotan? All of those are indeed "American" accents, but they're not "The American" accent.
Vikings, Celts, Picts... The best mixture of peoples these islands have harboured. Their legacy no more present than in Ireland today haha
LOOK UP THE MISSING SOUP CAN VIDEO! 😅😅😅
Watch Derry girls! It's an actual Irish tv series that cast actual Irish people!
People like Scottish accents??
I went to Ireland when I was like 8 and I was around my Irish cousins so much that I had an accent without really realizing it the rest of the trip there 😂
Yup the Dublin lads
This is my impression of the Irish accent: if a person consumed the British and American accent, and then took a massive shit, that shit would be what the Irish accent is.
MOOORE
Mate thyme is a plant 🌱😂
Irish Lads, Irish LADS, IRISH LADS-
@jackspeticeye Netflix's Derry Girls would really be up your alley!
WHAT IS THE % OF SUBSCRIBERS THING OML I CANT ESCAPE IT LMFAOOOOO
I am an Irish boy and I don't even have an Irish accent
Why is it that I understand real Irish people talking better then bratt pitt and.. I'm Finnish
sprite cranberry add
MIRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
In the south it’s actually not bad at all it’s the east Nd north of Ireland that are fucked xd
Jacksepticeye is a vowel bender im a bowel bender.
Can't believe he doesn't know the rubberbandits
I remember my first job working in a sneaker shop, my manager was on a break and I was alone (I‘m dutch) and some irish dude came into the store and I could not understand what sneaker he wanted but I did how ever think that he asked me on a date (I guess) when I told him that I just couldn‘t help him. Is that normal in Ireland?
It seems with the strong accent, the problem is people not opening their mouths.
my dads side of the family is very irish despite us being american lmao. I've seen that video of the shepherds so many times over so many years because of them
the less you understand an irish speaking english, the greater the accent
As a non English native speaker, Irish and scottish accent sound like a COMPLETELY different language jajaja I understand shit.
The only thing I understood was "sheep".
I could understand half the words that Irish guy said
I think British accent ( modern RP accent ) is the best accent
Jack... when you play games with other irish people you're accent gets thicker (or as you say it Tic-her, yea that's how it sound to me at least) and you begin to sound like the farmer
Bevis and butthead is the best show ever
I can understand the heavy accent, but the really heavy heavy one. I can’t.
did he say fartyfive? Oo
"START DRINKIN' MORE MILK BITCH!" - Seàn Mclaughlin (?)  Sorry if I spelled your last name wrong ;-;
1:47 - Jack makes fun of this, but he also forgot about the "I LOVE NATURE" video....
The cork accent was relatively weak in comarison to most cork accents, not to metion the kerry accent. Feckin mental
That is not a louth accent but ok
Ya the kerry one was a 💯% british
wait... doesnt he say “top of the mornin” at the start of his videos?
thick Irish accents sound like enchanting table writing
Oh my f$cking god it just sounds like gibberish I don’t get how jack gets it
I swear every irish has been to skibbereen it's a gem
The Kerry accent is the hardest to understand it’s like another language
Im irish and i cant even understand that 😂
Sense I'm from kerry i basically understood the whole thing oml that's strong aha
The girl saying caps
the hearders irish reminds me if icelands language
Wild mountain thyme but the cast is the Irish Lads 😂
When I used to go out to Ireland there was this man across the road who even my friends from there couldn’t understand
you wouldn't be long getting frostbit, it is a nice accent to be fair I could listen to such speach all day :D
Ppl outside of ireland don't realise that our small little island has wayy to many accents
I have a spontaneous Irish accent, and what's funny is it's actually accurate because my grandmother said I sounded like her mother, who was fully Irish and who I have never met because she died before I was maDe
Pierce Brosnan has a worse Irish accent. Look at the movie The Foreigner
Start drinkin more milk, B I T C H!
DId anyone else notice Jason Statham in the Snatch one?
Me, a person from Waterford who doesn't think I have an accent vs these people:
I'm betting that Evelyn would react the same way Seán's reacting to this if she'd react to the Brussels accent. Ir's still Dutch but damn...
I’m so sad the north just got abandoned, I just wanted to be included :’(
5:34 looks like he's speaking Dutch
Laughed my ass off the whole video 😂😂
0:39 oohhh self burn those are rare...!
"Why don't you cast Irish people?" - Well, Emily's from the next country over, which is basically the same thing for Americans, no?
Bruh how can anyone tell what he is saying, that’s wild 😂😂
Is it bad I understand the farmer
It's only me that hears german mixed with english? xD
Bro Chris isn’t even trying
I got an ad about Canadians pretending to be Irish 😂
When you said “he had a rock tied to his neck” you sounded like gru from Despicable me 2:20
CAN I LIVE IN IRELAND i'm from quebec and i feel the accent in my soul, i'm not a native speaker but i kinda get it also the weather looks less shit :D
Ngl I got some of what the sheep farmer was saying but Jesus that's a thiccc accent
He didn't recognise Blindboy when when they were doing the limerick accent
you NEED TO include Sir Timothy Stevo
Been Irish. These videos where very cringe
:D
You asked for what we think is the best Irish, and that would be yours!    Jk.
would love to here Jack's thoughts on derry girls. that show is hilarious and has a surprising amount of heart.
the accet is over 9000
Snatch, one of the greatest films of all time imo
I wish you still played fortnite
I’m from the south of Ireland and I don’t understand what the fuck ur man on about
I could understand everything the sheep farmer was saying 😊
Dunno if you know thid, but that thing Brad Pitt's speaking in Snatch isn't Irish, but Shelta, an Irish-English-Romani mixed language. So if you didn't quite understand that, it's not so weird: it's a different language. :)
Jack you should make a video with you reacting to Newfoundlander's accent :D
The easiest accent to mimick is the American accent because even if you butcher it, it still sounds like an American accent.
I have an irish friend with a thick accent, I messed up some words once while our group was out for a drink and the audacity to make the joke "slowly, just get the words out" I was like, "fuck you, why don't YOU get your words out?" That was great fun when they told me, sadly, I only remembered that I said "fuck you" to him since I was drunk then.
So according to this list of the sexiest accents in the world, people apparently get turned on the more difficult it is to understand someone.
Things like this are reasons why I like jacksepticeye and the Irish accent
So the Irish don't say Top of The Mornin'..... well, Jack if I may then why is your coffee brand called that? ... also last i checked your Irish and you used to say that alllllll the time in your intros for years..... hmmmmm ... lol all in good fun! 😊
Wheres brian😂
no you are a good irish
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH Scotland :(
I actually thi k jacks accebt is litt e rally perfect it sounds good and you can understand him
I feel like this is homage to the Unus Annus video which was: "2 men 200 accents."
Jack! Next time check out The Boondock Saints!
The only person that has the best Irish accent is Sir Stevo Timothy. Ahhhh, imagine video with Jack and him, that would be dope
The irish: speak in an unintelligible accent about sheep stuff Women of the world: Yah that's hot
I love how Sean chuckled when they slapped the horses arse 😂
WHAT THE FUCK JEFF
i lost it at Vowelbender
I honestly couldn't understand that farmer 😂 but it reminded me of a time I was out in Liverpool, and I heard a drunk Irish man and drunk Scottsman having an argument 😂 was the funniest thing ever because nobody but their friends could understand what they was saying 😂 I was just sipping my pint thinking this has to be put on TV 😂
The sheep farmer guy sounded like he was speaking chinese or something 😂🤣
*when you’ve lived in Ireland your whole life but still can’t tell if your Dublin accent is there-*
I haven't lived in Newfoundland for years now, but thanks to the baymen there I can still understand ridiculously thick Irish accents.  The by's, they got to me .  I guess that's what happens when you live somewhere that at one point was made up of 80% Irish people mostly from Northern Ireland.  I don't know if it's a skill or a curse, so I have nothing to say other than: Whaddya at by's?
We need more of these
I thought the Brad pitt accent was like that because he was a gypsy
Still can't beat the Baltimore accent trying to say "Aaron earned an iron urn" "ern ernd n ern ern"
Brad Pitt's accent just makes him sound high. hes slurring all his words.
I've the auld mayo accent meself
PP
That's unfair I can't even understand normal English properly xd
I'm from Denmark and I can totally relate to the different accents around the country But i love the Irish accent
It’s weird how its like that because the farmer from Kerry I couldn’t understand much but since I’m from cork I was just wondering how people found the cork lads hard to understand
I watched Call me Kevin watch the farmer and even he was STRUGGLING trying to understand him 🤣
Jack: Time like the herb Me: TF IS A HERB?
Am I the only one thinking Irish people talk like they are trying so hard to be ventriloquists ?
in all my 20 years of living in ireland Mayo, North Dublin and Cork have the strongest accents
thing is, as a french dude who learned english by watching different contents online, my accent is all over the place. and because of sean i pronounce certain words with an accent (like "fun" i pronounce "fon" (faun? ) sometimes) god dammit
I didn't know that the Irish pronounce "Sweet" with two syllables.  I don't know what to do with my life anymore.
Fs for the farmer who lost his sheeps...
Very fun! Thanx bro! 💚
If u go back to Ireland, take me with u 🥺
I guess I'm gonna eat shit... ( 0:26 )
When your irish you dont realise you have an accent 😂😂 or is that just me 😂😂
I was adopted when I was five, I just found out a couple years ago that my birth grandparents immigrated to the US from Cork Ireland! One day I’d like to go and see if I have any extended family
So all the tdotoreals stating this is how you do an Irish accent is like someone saying this is how you do an American accent. 1 big problem on both is to pick a region for bother their is not just one. I have lived in the north, West, Midwest , and swamps not one sounds the same. I have family in Ireland and none sound the same.   Btw if you want to here a midwestern actor "Speak Irish" lol watch the irishman that makes me laugh
1:42 “This sausage with love” hahahaha
Love how the farmer starts talking and Sean starts grinin lol
I am FOOKIN crying after he went, “There was a rock tied around his neck.”
You did better with the translation than CallMeKevin did XD
"What the fuck, Jeff?!"
7:45 Yes jack this is exactly the way we hear you.
I got the second farmer okay. The first one I couldn't really understand, but the second one was a lot easier. just basically "all you need is a good dog and a warm, fine night. just put the dog around 'em."
AAAAAHHHHHHHHHH   okay I had to release the cringe 😭😭😭
We NEED a "What the fuck, JEFF!?" t-shirt 🤣
😮 you should travel round the whole of Ireland for a month and do a travel vlog for a month?
Bro love the content 🇨🇮🇨🇮🇨🇮🇨🇮🇨🇮🇨🇮🇨🇮🇨🇮🇨🇮🇨🇮🇨🇮
the hot fuzz sene was with a west country accent
Im mostly Irish and French and a tinsy bit Aussie lineage
Australia 4th sexiest accent in the world? I have hope 🤣🤣🤣
This video was so irish my latte turned into irish coffee xD
One of my best friends is Irish and he can do a perfect accent
Definitely the sheep farmer
If you want to hear one hell of an accent, I would recommend checking out a Newfoundland accent, out of Canada!
Your not 100% irish like Kevin oreilly tho
New game: are they trying to be Irish or Scottish?   Since a lot of people when they attempt an Irish accent sound Scottish and when they attempt a Scottish accent sound Irish 😂😂
Noooooo the last few seconds of that last video was gonna show off the NI accent!
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 its the translating for me
I can't hear jacks accent.
Only listening, I could only faintly get the gist of what he’s saying, but I still need translation to justify what I thought I heard.
With that farmer, if I tried I could make out some words. Not a whole lot, but some. It’s like knowing a couple car things, but you’re not an expert, so an expert talking in detail about it is like gibberish to you.
It was fun. Thank you.
Those irish rowers were kinda hot.
I-is jack getting o-old
It would be hilarious if you reacted to a really thick northern Irish Belfast accent.
5:06  that would be felix trying to speak irish whilst having a swedish accent
I had to turn on caption to understand anything lol
When the accent is so heavy, I started to question whether the language was actually English... I could not understand anything the irish farmer was saying, and it sounded like a completely differrnt language...
My family are from county Kerry, my grandparents visit sometimes and I've always wanted to go but I'm terrified for this exact reason
How the fuck can he translate that so easy???🤣🤣
Spedicey: The Last Vowelbender
Lady: ✨park✨ and ✨garden✨ Sean: ⚠️pARK⚠️ 😀 ⚠️gARDEN⚠️ 😀
om f g, i had a f great time f watching this video hahahahaha this is gold
11:14 ATLA Nani?!?
Where are I from south east west or north
19:24 "Ya know how we go out and we kickin' and flyin' and shavin' bollocks, you know" ???
Been in Ireland during 2 months to learn english.. I caught the irish accent quite quickly
As an Irish lad I find it easy to understand this Edit: everyone in donegal says mrhrhr instead of mirror
Am I the only person who sounds like they're speaking in cursive when they try to do an Irish accent?
I’m not dumb I don’t think but isn’t Christopher walkins Irish
5:50 sounds like danish bruuh
19:48 Holy crap... You guys get Spar shops in Ireland??? I thought Spar was only to be found in my homeland of South Africa... My mind is officially nuked to blazes. I wonder what other countries have Spar shops...
It sounds like a mix of German and English to me like....WTH xD
0:38 Sean: “GO BACK TO BED CHILD - DRINK MORE MILK BITCH” Me: *sitting in bed with a cup of milk watching this before sleeping*
0:42is that a Dani reference?
i forgot he was speaking english
MORE OF THESE VIDEOS IRISH ACCENTS ARE THE GREATEST MORE!!!!!!!!!!! and i like the cork accent the best
Irish accents is a multiverse
The frostbit video made me laugh so much before, I used to quote it so often hahahaha
He didn't say anything bout straya
There's a fantastic clip of a country pub being reopened and I'm not sure  which part of Ireland (island) the guy is but his accent is even thicker than the sheep one.
I love your accent!
a sheep is 50-300$ in the US x45 that's quite a bit of money
Irish pick up lines with jack
Dammit jack has a flower   The vocul couch 15 miles away wait it’s called flare Me: what he has a flare gun that’s even worse
I also love that wild mountain thyme is supposed to be based in mullingar, and I can tell you now, those scenez are not mullingar.
THAT SCHOOL BOYE SOUNDS LIKE HE'S FIFTY YEARS OLD
Jaysus Jack not even the Kerry accent is that undecipherable as Brad Pitts version😂
5:00 the problem is I can understand around haglf of of it its the other haglf that annoys me
Jack you should do a impression of arnold' source naga snopes a reeeeee Terminator 2;23
Fake irish people doing accents:  Jack: This is the funniest shit I've ever seen.
Sometimes I forget Séan is Irish. I wonder if he’s lost some of his accent after moving away from Ireland or if it were never was that strong.
Jack: "Irish is the sexiest accent in the world"  Also Jack: "it'll get your blood flowing"   👀👀 I mean...yeah... that's one way of putting it
"Go back to bed child, start drinking more milk, bitch." Me: drinking milk getting ready to sleep at 4 in the morning. Yes
Super fun :3
Okay kevin
Sean doing a Chris Walken impression is amazing XD
You'll probably not read this/have been asked this ad nauseum, but do you, Terroriser and Mini Ladd ever talk to each other?
My husbands grandfather is as bad as that farmer sometimes. We're Irish, but even we sometimes are like "What are you going on about?" 🤣
Sean must be a very big fan of jacksepticye
“Yep, I’m a vowel bender”
As an australian who has family in cork, it's a nightmare to  try and figure out what they're saying
It’s 4:10 am what am I doing
“START DRINKING MORE MILK BITCH!” *haha* (I cant believe I said that 😂) later** (It’s staying in!)
The Irish accent is just a different language
Can’t believe he missed “dya like dags” & “whythefuckwouldiwantacaravan that’s got no fuckin wheels” from snatch absolute classic
Jack should react to really strong country accents from the us it would be hilarious 😂 please thumb this up if you would like to see it
The Kerry farmer who lost his sheep sounds like your man Fred from the Eurovision episode of Father Ted 😂😂
he says his opening is cringey.."tOP TO DA MORNIN TO YA LADDIES MAH NAME IS JACKSEPTICEYE"
you know, Jack.. Truth be told, I don't really care much about the accents, still I like the accents. What is so good about Irish people is their honesty and their easy life style. The Irish are one of my most favorite people in the world. That is also why I like your channel for example... you are a rare type of youtuber, successful yet not at all arrogant, maybe one of a kind... Stay how you are, bud!
The irish flower that that lady said was more like when I say floor (I'm scottish)
The farmer sounds like gru speaking gibrish
"Brad Pitt in Snatch!" Careful there Jack ;)
MY favourite is the Jacksepticeye Irish of course
To be fair on the movies behalf, if the actors actually were full blooded Irishmen, the consumers  would probably not understand what was going on in the movie unless you're from Ireland. Because they probably wouldn't understand what anyone is saying half the time and dislike it anyway. I  could be wrong though. I know I wouldn't, cause I don't even know what jack says sometimes. Like at the end when he said fearghal which I think meant "man of valor" (I looked it up)
Jack... corpse made a new accent....
As a fellow Irishman this video gave me a good laugh
That student sounded like an old farmer lmao
it sounded like he sed frost butt not bit
I lost it at "Im a vowelbender" 🤣
Please make a part two 😂
Jack is irish yet I'm still amazed when he translates and nails these accents lol. Loved this one
shouldve got the irish lads in for a group call to take the piss out of all the fake irish accents
I just love irish people so much more.  I'm part irish. Not connected to that family but god I wish I knew more
Oooo please part 2, had great laugh
The longer I watch this video, the better I understand the accent and what they're saying. If you want to play along, close your eyes.
H
Loved this Jack. I laughed a lot & still have a smile on my face. The Irish have the best humour. Never change. 😁😁👍
Loved this
I have been watching youtube since the beginning, how the F is it possible I have NEVER watched a vid of this dude? Hes HILARIOUS 😂😂😭😭
Brad Pitt's Irish sounded more Scottish to me, a Scot-Irish blend?!  i dinna even ken  :/
Me, a non-native who just differentiates accents in "British" and "Bri-ish": Ha ha, wrong accent thing funny
Being Irish, this video was both cringy and hilarious
Why the hell does the news reporter sound like young Jack?
My voice went full Irish when I  saw this
accents are like a long game of telephone
part 2 !! this was so fun to watch
School boy frost bit sound like frost butt 😆😆😆😆
I'm Irish:)
6:43 reminds me of the crazy dude from plants vs zombies
I think I've figured out why some of their accents are so heavy. Its like they have lock jaw and hardly move their lips and just add their daily Irish accents
Sooooooooo why didn’t they just cast Irish actors/actresses?? 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 where is the Irish?!
do a british accent and you sound very much like someone I belive to be dead . . . I KNOW!
is it just the lighting or does Jack have some grey hairs?
why are the sheep colored
Jack translated the sheep dude... but who’s gonna translate jack?
I imagine Irish youtubers tone down the accents a little in their videos so that it would be understandable
Saying you're going to learn "an Irish accent" (or any accent really) with no clarification is like saying you're going to learn an American accent without specifying what region; y'all could get a thick Southern accent or a Minnesota accent or a New Jersey accent or everything in between xD
Love how the example doodle for Limerick was one of the Rubberbandits
I love how he gets to Australia and just says nothing like that’s right Sean I see your respect there
First time checking in on this channel in a while and wasn’t greeted with a high five :(
Are there any North American accents that foreigners find hard to understand?
I don’t have an Irish accent cause I wasent born in Ireland or anything, but I am Irish, and some words I say come out with an Irish accent and I’m kinda just like “ oh wow dident know I could do that- “
I love how he translates rural irish accent for us because he realizes most of us cannot possibly understand.
I think Seán should do videos on learning different accents. It could be fun
An actor: is falling horribly at sn irish accent  Ads:what if an alien babe fell into your arms
and no Sean your accents pretty clear and easy to understand especially compared to some of the others you've shown even Brads impression was harder to understand... question do Irish Movies and and shows have English subs like animes? I think translation would help... not that i've been struggling I got sensitive ears and even though I don't speak any 2nd language fluently I can tell languages pretty often by the sound of em!  e.g the chinese hold on their vowels and the japanese like to have every syllable the same length when they speak, I can finally tell the difference between north and south korean aswell now even if I can't tell what they're saying...   then theres the instinct we all have body language and face expressions are almost universal so it's a good thing to learn cause even if something isn't translated you can get the gist of whats happening  as for west european accents I think ireland and england have way too many theres some english accents I can't understand so I think people focus on the popular ones that tend to sound like clear English and forget theres accents here that sound like a completely different language but are still considered an english accent!, and that's before you consider regional words that are just a local word but don't exist in the rest of the country!
It's funny to watch an Irish guy laugh at Irish people accents and make fun of.
14:16 I'm Brazilian and I'm really thinking of maybe, just maybe, visiting Ireland someday with the intention of living there. I really like what I saw about your people, your culture, cuisine, even your population density (I really dislike densely populated places, and Ireland has around the same density as Brazil which is pretty good in some places)
Jacks impression of Christopher Walken sounds more like Arnold Schwarzenegger
my great aunt has a strong accent like the farmer man and I can’t understand a word she says it’s so awkward 😖
Accents are funny things. I get mistaken as an American because (apparently, I don't hear it myself) I have a Southern "twang"...I'm Canadian though.
These are the moments I wish I knew what my accent is from. Like, i been cursed by genetics that I look half white and Asian, yet am full Mexican. And my accent is *completely* different from both Mexicans and Americans near me. Hell even my own family doesn't have my accent XD and i know I'm not adopted so that's out of the list I also been asked if I was Russian, Asian, or/and white so I'm hella confused.
imagine being Hispanic and taking a Spanish class, and the teacher says, "your accent isn't right" 🙄
i think sean's accent was the greatest and most beautiful one amirite
1:04 sounds like an Irish David Attenborough or like Walken was trying to sound like Attenborough because he's been watching Life On Earth for about half an hr! (yes I know each episode is longer than that, that's the joke), and trying to sound more like an irish man at the same time all the while it's a blend of three because you can still hear walken's distinct accent!
I honestly can't hear anything in common in the way you, Call Me Kevin and RTGame speak, for a kind of small country you do have lots of local dialects(or maybe I just can't "catch" the differences)
Jack is really good at how to do an Irish accent I wonder how
I'm actually irish so that is weird
I’m so sad because I’m half Irish and don’t have a lick of a fookin accent
The first Irish farmer there, I could barely fuckin understand him but the second wasn't too hard
Jack sounds like a dude id meet on the street but are those other people even speaking English
The Church there in the Country Cork picture, sure I was just there a couple months ago, we were gonna go down to spike islands but it was closed so Me, My Granny and My Sister went in there, its Coleman's Church I'm pretty sure
How many Irish accents are there, I wouldn't know, i live in Fermanagh.
irish man, watches a how to speak an irish accent video.... "iM GrEaT At ThIS"
OMG Jack... are you grow gray hairs? wtf
Jack is starting to have white hair, and it's making me feel old and sad
What headphones is he using?
My favourite one : "Over FARThY FIVE sheep were stolen"
I knew some of what that dude said bc im actually part irish but like damn    Edit* happy irish noises
How the fuck you translate that shit
2:21, why the hell does he sound like gru from despicable me... is that just me
Oh this was fun! You know, on top of the Irish accents, you've got the way Irish people structure their sentences too that makes them so unique among English-speakers. You don't get a direct yes or no to "did you break the dishes?" you'll get an "it was me" or "it was not me" more likely. I'm just a simple author and accent study still in the process of learning everything I can about language and accents. My curiosity has forged this path and it is so enjoyable learning and comparing various things. I went off on a tangent, pardon.
Is it bad that I almost always understood them? I guess my 44% Irish in me is shining through ☘️😃
That Christopher Walken impression was pretty awesome. I saw the play version of Wild Mountain Thyme. Pretty good play (Also don't know why they went with that name since the play is different) I feel like if you can get past the accents then you might enjoy the writing. At least they got one Irishman in there and that is Jamie Dornan. But yeah I'm not Irish and even I noticed the accents were way off. Usually they can find a better advisors to help out with accents, but also from an actor standpoint...the Irish accent is super hard  to learn because of all the regions. I did have fun watching this video. Just seeing what a TRUE IRISHMAN would say about some of these videos :D
😂😂😂😂 I love Irish people
Brad Pitt’s Irish accent almost sounds like Dan’s when he’s emphasizing his lol
18:16 "we don't sound like leprechauns in acid"...  Procedes to speak like a leprechaun on acid.
All I could think of was the Hot Fuzz scene, I know he said that but it’s just so much like it.
Jack is so BI (Or maybe I need to start accepting the possibility that basic compliments and affection doesn't mean I'm-I mean that he's gay.)
youtube looks at this video and looks over it and says lets not even fucking demonetize this what the is going on
What... the rowers were perfectly understandable. Especially compared to the sheep herder.
mister sheep gamers accent kills me
“The 'Newzild' dialect is outrageously charming,” the travel site wrote of the accent which is spoken across New Zealand. “The sexiest accent in the world? It's official.” Following New Zealand were the South African and Irish accents, which placed second and third, respectively
TOP OF THE MORNIN!!! (Jack did i do good?)
0:18 have they heard corpse though cause that would completely change the game
2:20 GRU IS THAT YOU!?
Is there a native language in Ireland? Do people speak 'Irish' or something else?
The farmer one is like trying to figure out what a baby is saying in its first months
Even comparing Sean with Kevin, they sound similar, but after listening to them both for so long I can tell they're still different from each other's. It's so fun learning about it
jacks has grey hair noooooooo the end of yt is near
2:20 YOUR CHRISTOPHER WALKEN IMPRESSION IS BETTER THAN WALKEN'S IRISH IMPRESSION LMAOAOOAOAOOOOOOOOO
hey sean, your light keep getting brighter and brighter; soon it'll just be your irises (which are nice and all, but)
Omg I actually laughed when jack made a pun with the county louth thing, lol
Jacks voices sounds weird for an American it sounds like he’s an Irish person
Ah I see u took something from Kevin
I’m liking this video because of the ad
Seeing people attempt an Irish accent is like watching people attempt a Southern accent and just barely miss it
These are so similar to the Minnesotan accents in the US.
I would say my Irish accent isn't too bad, but that's mostly because I'm (around) half Irish.
I want to go to Ireland now. I love how simple the news is tho
6:10 I’m just sitting there like “I like your funny words magic man”
Theres a video jug voice coaching video that shows how to do a irish accent. I want to see more of Sean just judging accents
This was great
11:16 I’m a Val bender🤣
At this point it's a different language
Petition to have Jack watch the entire Luck Of The Irish film please
Even tho I'm South Georgian, my family has Irish origin
I feel like everybody says, "that's a bad accent", when different places actually have different accents from each town to town. So next time you think, "that's a bad accent", just know there are different god damn dialects
Why do so many ppl have trouble understanding accents like this? Tis not very 'ard bai's
After 6:30 i was able to understand most of what i was hearing. I’m not sure if it was my brain that adapted incredibly fast or if they where actually just easier to understand after that point. I feel proud nonetheless
Does sean have,, grey hair?
Check out the accent of people from Newfoundland in Canada , if your Irish y'all be shocked I promise
Well next gen a while ago would be a ps4 and stuff but u know what i mean 😄
Month 11 of trying to get Jack to sub to me s and see if his subs will to so I can surpass charli and giveaway a next gen console
What I always find funny as an american with a very mid western tame accent is when foreigners do an "american" accent and they either do the New Yorker "Eyyy I'm walkin' here!" or the cowboy yeehaw voice or the california surfer voice. No one really sounds like those in real life only in movies.
5:05 man escapes mental hospital, starts yelling random shit at sheep
Why am I getting ads in Spanish
I think Sèan should do a tutorial of the Irish accent from where he used to live!
Im American... when im a tad ticked off a bit of Irish unintentionally comes out of me and i start speaking in an accent sometimes
nnoooo jack u have white hairs
Last year my friend and I stayed with some family friends in Dublin. They kept complaining that they couldn't understand our accents. We're Australian...
Only Brad Pitt can make something sound right even when it's not
Aaaaa dis vid too short saddd
I remember one video where Jack got real drunk. His accent kicked in at one point. “JAY-SES”
Wow, Irish accents have depth 😂😂
I didn’t understand a fucking word of this video but it was entertaining
the BagBoy reference at the end!
That was cool to watch
"frostbutt"
My great uncle from Co. Clare has never left the country in his entire 85 years of life, his accent is so thick I have my gma translate lmao
"probably the night then a beautiful morning lightest contributed bright out in the conveyor up in the mountains where it should well there was 45 sheep missing fishing lake in the 'langsen' and when the sheep it's gone it's gone out to the life where like um lassing up in 'idk' you go over there
I'm a bit Irish
Faurty five is what I said when I was five
HOW did you UNDERSTAND THAT?!
Oiland
Jack: IRISH ACCENTS!  Board: Kinda SUS...
I'd seen that last video before, and I was hoping it would come up. 😂💖
“no luck for you, scotland! HAH, eat shit, france!” *sad demoman and spy noises*
Brad Pitt isn’t doing an Irish accent. He’s doing an Irish gypsy accent.
Grandad's from Cark. Can't understand a thing he says..
As an American I feel like i could understand the older guy if I spent more time around him, the frostbit kid might as well be speaking greek. Minnesota here, frostbit'll get ya y'know, but ya gotta deal with it fer sure, hard to move but you can deal and get over, depends on where you're at. Kitty wompas.
2 men 200 accents, Anyone?
Me finally finding a legit reason as to how Nogla could also be Irish but sound like.... that. (I dont hate noglas accent it's just VERY unique)
I love the old intro
Sean, are you familiar with the Rubber Bandits?
ia ma an indian and nearly died during the sheep guy trying to understand what he's saying
Can you replay raft now that it has been updated again
Man Galway always gets shafted when there’s vids about us. City o culture baby
Ze French will rise, and conquer Ireland and rename it France 2
5:06  I didn’t even realize he was speaking English at first lmao
Sometimes I forget he’s Irish. Like I know he is but I’ve watched him for so many years that his accent has been drowned in my memory and I don’t hear much different than how I speak lol
to the Irish farmers accent. what
Seriously though, what’s so hard about casting Irish people for Irish roles lmao
I didn't know that Ireland had their own version of a Louisiana accent.
You know Niall Horan from One Direction, he is from Ireland. He's from Mullingar.
i can sort of understand most of what they are saying
I love how an Irishman makes a better impression of Christopher walken than Christopher walken does of an irishman
Newfoundland, Canada is the Ireland of Canada
American english is the best
the way i practically kinda pick up tiny things about the accent 👁👄👁 i watch too many irishmen
Damn from cork’s accent i remembered Kevin he dose actually still has the accent
Fuckin "flayer" 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
More of this, please. Even if you were just enjoying yourself, I had a great time chuckling along.
I can get out every 5 words from that one sheep dude hahahaha
Sean I hope this makes u laugh but did u know that patatos r irish apples🤣
jack: “ are you gonna say fliur”  her: “flear”  jack: “wtf”
Top of the mornin to ya lady’s
im irish-italian. unfortunately my parents decided a speech therapist should make sure i have a midwestern american accent, to sound a sofrgettable as possible that isnt even a joke. they didnt want me to steal their thunder
I  hope the 1/3 of my ancestors are proud of me for looking into current Irish culture.
good vid but...         it wud be noice if u played generation zero :D
Dude... that doesn’t even sound like English . What the hell , sounds like that make up language you do with your friends when you’re growing up
County Kerry. Lads
Hey jack I was wondering if you can buy me a Christmas present ps nic3 video peace out :)
Sounds like my dad when he's frustrated
"Keep it in the blindfold, Jeff." I can't.
there's an old lady in my local library that reads to the kids and she's got the coolest irish accent, i LOVE irish accents. jack's accent is my favorite out of all of them.
Hello there sir🙂
Give us more videos like this lmao
*Scrooge McDuck with bees up his nose is all I hear*
I’m vorifed
As an Auzzie I understand the pain of people (mostly Americans) butchering our language & the frustration of people not understanding what we’re saying. Except in Ireland it seems to be due to pronunciation and in Australia we usually just use different words.
Irish accent sounds to American accent what Chilean accent sounds to the rest of Latin America (they're supposed to speak spanish, but they manage not to)
I'm sorry, the subtitles weren't working for me here. I understand this is a video about potatoes, yes? And Christopher Walken, for some reason? Potatoes and Chris Walken.
Is my name Irish or Scottish?
full scores to robin for adding that arrow to your brow at 11:16 cracked me up
All I could hear is Shay from Assassin's Creed: Rouge
I think it's better for the farmer to stay as far away as possible from me before i offended him bcs i will for sure just answer yes or no randomly to his every question without knowing what he was asking 🙃
Imagine if hes just been lying about his Irish accent for so long
I'm Northern Irish (notoriously difficult accent) and I can't stop laughing
I specifically came here to watch Jack watch the video at 4:57 XD
Snatch is such an awesome classic
I'm not Irish but that vocal coach made me cringe so hard
Love Irish accents! Although I am partial towards my family's accents. I need to capture audio of my aunt speaking her first language, Spanish, with an acquired Irish accent, and my cousin conversing with her. My family, on my mother's side, are Colombian, and her oldest sister married an Irishman from Belfast. They live there to this day, and it's been my goal to save up and see them again when the pandemic is finally under control.
I did understand the school boy. But the sheep herder....I honestly thought I was on acid.
Honestly this is literally just Newfoundland some of those accents are just as thick
damn my guy has gotten older and grown ever since, last time i saw him as a kid :)
Not that you'll ever see this comment, but I actually really like these random videos on Ireland. I'm writing a fantasy series based on Irish folklore, so learning anything about the people and culture is super fascinating, and helpful. I also just really love Ireland. I hope I get to visit, or maybe live there one day.
imagine being an Arabic guy watching this ...
I was happy watching this video because im half Irish
LMFAO
How to do an Irish accent physically hurt me. Oy and Oyreland... Fleurr
the Bigfoot of the spoken world, eh? well I’ll take it I’ll tell ya
I'm a Texan so I get the whole 'people trying to mimic your accent and failing miserably' thing.. Every time I hear someone who isn't southern attempt a southern American accent it makes me cringe but then again, actual _STRONG_ genuine southerner accents make me cringe too. LOL.
Bro I’m Scottish
My favourite one has to be Dublin and cork, to be honest I’ve only been to Dublin once but would love to go there again.  Sean if you wanna react to something strange watch the film and tv series young offenders
Youre like coffee, hot, sweet and soon gonna be full of cream xD
oh godddd this was funny. sometimes i go find compilations like those but with scottish accents cause im scottish
Australian shouldn't even be on that list of the sexiest accents.
Oddly, as a Canadian, I find it sounds similar to strong Canadian accents
I thought every accent close to a British one is British
"Irish people don't say top of the morning" Aussies "Aww yeah we say g'day, we even put a cunt on it if we like the person"
Are we not gonna talk about how the guy at 19:48 is the guy from The Rubberbandits.
well this video was a lot of fun. enjoyed watching jack have a piss at different irish accents lol
I was crying before I watched this video, now I can’t stop crying from laugher 😂❤️
I evol hsiri stnecca.
Lol American is #10.. I’m surprised it even made it one the list! 😂😂
Ok so Jack asked about his accent I wouldn't know Jack I have a strong Irish accent and u just sound like a typical Irish accent
Brad pit was doing a Travellers accent though
yah, "mirror" is one syllable. "mehrrrr"
with the first news clip, with the 45 missing sheep, I could kind of understand it as long as I wasn't trying to listen to every word.
I'm from Cornwall (I don't have a Cornish accent, other than occasionally rolling my r's) and we get cross when people people mix up Westcountry accents, so I can sympathize when people deciding that there's one Irish accent and and every person with an Irish accent just spins around and insults them with the particular Irish dialect that is only found in the wee, small corner of the Emerald Isle that their accent comes from. It's like people saying "I can do an English accent" and what they mean is they can do a bad home-counties accent.  There are so many bloody English accents.  So many!  If they could actually do an English accent then they would be attempting to do a Dudley accent - an accent so maligned that even people from Dudley 'extract the michael' for sounding like they do.  But it's much more representational of a proper English accent than trying to sound like the Queen or trying to sound like a Cockney.  After all, the sheer amusement of my little niece asking for a 'hook' when she really wanted a cuddle just goes to show that the Cheshire accent is not without its quirks and that's true for any accent in Northern Ireland and in Great Britain.
As an Irish person, I've gone down this exact rabbit hole on YouTube. Anyway, we miss you too Seán, you're always welcome back here, even with the damage you've done with all the "top of the mornin' to you laddies!" 😂
Lmao
Belfast accent is pure ass like
USA: mirror Australia: Mi'rah Ireland: M'r
That was awesome! 😁🥰
"why didn't they cast irish people!" jack that's how we POC feel all the time
Jack did u really not spot blind boy from the rubber bandits in the Limerick section. Spar bag guy
you know what worse than irish accent, people trying so hard speak in irish
I think I only understood 10% of this video
Brad Pitt sounded like he was constantly dying every single time he said a word.
'You're such a fierce GOWL'
The Irish are really trying to communicate without moving their lips
My god I love being Irish
started the video not understanding the thiCC accents. Halfway through I was fine listening though
Keep up with the vids Jacky boi. As a recommendation for a video, try doing as many accents as you can.
this makes me SO proud to be irish lmfao  that and i’m from the same town as jack lived in before brighton and yes i’ve met him hehehe (it’s athlone , i met him in centra !!)
Lol anyone else think his Christopher Walken voice sound like gru 🤣
I think Irish people are beer benders
Well, this disproves my theory that the Irish accent is a mixture of the British accent and the way the New England speaks.
I love this so so much
Jack "its cringy when people ask me to say ... top of the mornin to ya." Jack/every intro ever ........ 16:14
I live where the frost bit guy lives. He was viral in Derry
This is a reupload
I have some Irish ancestors however i do not have an Irish accent, the video he criticizing is way off the accent, it is as bad as many Americans trying to do a British accent rather embarrassing they should have used an Irish man.
Been to Ireland once and have been wanting to go back since! Amazing country, wish I could see more of it.
I saw the play Disco Pigs, starring Evanna Lynch and Colin Campbell, which is set in Cork. The accents were so strong and honestly I really had to concentrate to understand, but I guess that means you're actually paying attention to the play. Anyway, I bought the screenplay and it's written in the accent! You can't make head nor tail of it unless you read it out loud and suddenly you're from Cork yourself 🤣  It's a wonderful play, pretty dark, but I do recommend.  Also, Colin Campbell was amazing and it makes me sad that he didn't get much recognition because he was acting alongside Luna Lovegood.
Is it weird for me that im able to understand Irish accents when im Asian
"sh features even when it's not there" hahahaha amazing ^^ that guy's guide was really funny and good.
This was great! Love accent/dialect stuff
When he super imposed the avatar arrow I died 😂😂😂
I don't know why but I was really shocked when Jack was able to translate that guy's accent so well
I don't think I should've been able to understand almost everything said in this video....
Ah shur, te accents aiynt tha bad at'll. Ih just takes a bih, o gettin uset ta! Nota boder
is it just me or does he sound german at 2:21
Irish person listening to "how to do an irish accent"
What is funny is I find Romanian accents fairly attractive.  Edit: Jack needs to watch the Scottish man vs sheep in the road video. Its fucking funny.   "Fokin move!"
I wonder what he thinks of Jin's accent from Yu Yu Hakusho in the dub. I would say that was my first introduction to an Irish accent. That guy with the sheep wasn't too hard for me at times.
19:00 "its levi-o-saaahh"
Sean: I wanna see how many of you can actually understand what he’s saying-  Me: Say no more bro... *puts on subtitles*
How is Australian accent not the most sexiest
this gave me a headache
that sounded vaguely like some sort of chinese dialect for some reason
Wouldn;t say 'bad,' just thicc enuff ta stop a bullet.
just watch the boondock saints if you want a good movie
Personally don't care if you're Irish. If you're proud of it, yay. But DON'T smack talk that milk
Irishman: *speaks in Rubik’s cube*
Tbf, in snatch he is meant to sound like a moron speaking gibberish. You know more than the average Irishman does anyone.
Meanwhile in Canada we all walk around denying that the Canadian accent exists.  Every Canadian at one point in there lives and either thought or said “I don’t have an accent, I’m Canadian”. But I will say, hardly anyone really gives a crap about maple syrup and we do not say “aboot”
Jack - *pause* Irishman -  N-- …No
Why are his eyelids orange
I really want to see Jack react to Newfie and PEI accents
Mum: what’s so funny?  Me: nothing   My brain: farty five
5:31 is that even English anymore?
man skipped northern ireland :(
And I cringed when he sed langers
this video needs to be english sub cuz this irish anime is hard
Dublin and limerick was gold.😂
Y'know I thought I understood at least the basics of pronouncing words in english. Turns out I was wrong.
well Jamie Dornan is Irish well hes Northern Irish
Are you going to be playing the new hitman Jack?
**Me sees horse** Also me: "juan."
i absolutely love hot fuzz
I'm irish    "Abbie" 2020
The farmer sounds like he is talking in a different language
Wait a minute, I've seen the play "Wild Mountain Thyme" is based on! It's called "Outside Mullingar"! This does not look like a good representation of the source material, because even putting the accents aside, Anthony Reilly (the male lead) isn't a weirdo. He's just shy and lonely. And the whole play happens over the course of two evenings. Inside Reilly and Muldoon houses.
@2:24 why did jack sound like Arnold Schwarzenegger for a few seconds Irish people can do his voice wow I thought he was a different person everyone that watched this
U should hear a drogheda accident
Scottish is 3rd? No. Just no
You should do a video on trying to do an American accent
I remember call me kevin did something kind of similar to this ages ago that led him to the same sheep video
I think Brad pit did a good job I dont think athlone had many travelers I live in rosscomon and around galway so any way I'd what I was saying I forgot
*Thumbs up if prefer Ownage Pranks accents* 😳
Also, don't forget The Devil's Own🤣
OMG I don't know why, but I need 10 more hours of Irish accent reviews from Sean. It's criminally entertaining; so much so that I had to come comment. Also that Dream subscribe bs got me; he really is a genius but I see Sean is playing both ends of that fiddle 😹.
That farmer sounds dutch
Sean translation of that dude was amazing
What's better: Brad Pitt's "Irish" accent or his "Creole" accent?
The Irish accents are such a treasure...    ha
what type of music. rock?
This was awesome.
) A group of 119 Israelis, including 30 professors, 25 rabbis, and around 20 medical doctors and scholars, recently signed an open letter to the new Israeli Health Minister, Yuli Edelstein.  Among the signatories are former Deputy Speaker of the Knesset Mr. Moshe Feiglin; former Knesset member Mr. Yehudah Glick; Prof. Jacob Lavee, who has been leading efforts to stop the Chinese Communist Party’s killing of Falun Dafa practitioners for organs in China; and chief rabbis of several cities and communities in Israel.  The letter calls on the Minister of Health to examine and immediately stop all cooperation between Israel and China in the field of organ transplantation. This includes preventing Chinese physicians from training and attending professional conferences in Israel, as well as stopping all cooperation in research and development between the two countries in the face of the Chinese regime's forced organ harvesting of prisoners of conscience.  The signatories believe that a law should be enacted immediately to impose criminal liability on all forms of cooperation with Chinese entities on organ transplantation, including by private Israeli companies.  In addition, the signatories asked the Minister of Health to stop direct and indirect transmission of Israeli citizens’ genetic information to Chinese state-owned companies. Furthermore, the signatories call for immediate action to end Israel’s dependence on Chinese medical equipment and to re-examine the need for, and moral justification of, existing “twin hospital” agreements between Israeli and Chinese hospitals.  Two Israeli media outlets covered the issue: a radio station interviewed one of the signatories, and an online Russian TV station interviewed the petition’s initiator.  The petition was submitted to the Ministry of Health at the end of May, but no reply has been received so far.   The project was started by an Israeli Falun Dafa practitioner, who suggests that practitioners in other countries consider taking similar initiatives.
I feel so lucky to be Irish lmao like there’s only like 5 million people in the country and we have the sexiest accent in the world lol go us
5:09 WHEN I TELL YOU I WAS WHEEZING I-

So does jack know Irish?? Dumb question but I’m curious
I just love how the Irish don't pronounce there H's three is tree lol
my ears are bleeding.
I speak English, French and Arabic, and this shit sounds closer to Arabic than English to me xD.
Now do Daithi's accent :'D
Wild Mountain Time sounds like quite a different film...
funny how i realized this now but, there was actually An Irish lad in Red dead redemption 2 named sean.  WELL OK, ILL CATCH YOU LATER THEN.
I think the reason they get the accent wrong so many times is cause theyre using bits and pieces from each of the accents mashed together so it sounds like a hape of shite
JACK! how'd u not notice that was the rubber bandits at the very end from stab City itself
The sheep guy sounds like another language than you somehow haha
Why did all of my family have to go to Australia I could've had that sexy accent
I thought that farmer was speaking Gaelic his accent was so thicc 😳
Don't Judge me
*ME WHEEZING CUZ I HEARD FROSTBUTT* Im sorry if this is offensive XD
As a north of the border lad, the "frostbit" schoolboy has me cringing since it's one of the accents I hear the most (besides Belfast or Derry accents).
I hit subscribe simply because you put yourself through this. Thank you for your sacrifice.
Sean: Go back to bed Child  Me: Fine  *Cries self to sleep*
45 sheep is a big deal.
Kerry is mad
Bless those rowing lads, had to make sure they were included cuz they were the absolute highlight from Rio
My brain was fried trying to understand that farmer
As a spanish speaker person, i understand nothing.
No, thyme as the Ferb.
11:36 Jack: is Irish Also Jack : "I'm fucking great at this"
I'm studying English in France and everytime we speak about English accents, teachers end up showing us the video of that old man who lost his sheeps x) I think Irish accents are very cool and fun to listen to ✨
Ok I just wanna say as a person who lives with only people born in England and who’s only living blood related family is English...WHO ELSE GETS SUPER ANNOYED AND ANGRY WHEN SOMEONE PRONOUNCES WATER LIKE THE T IS A D AND PRONOUNCE IT AS WADER?!?!LIKE ITS A T NOT A D AND IT SHOULD’NT MAKE ME CALM WHEN JACK PRONOUNCES IT RIGHT!Who can relate?🙃
2:23 when jack goes arnold 😂
u mean “oonderstand”
Hey my dad worked on Wild Mountain Time
The hardest language is afrikaans
Which accent was the greatest? Why, yours, Jackaboy!
Have you ever played hurling
People doing Irish accents that just sound like shite... Have you met Taliesin Jaffe's accent for Mollymauk Tealeaf? Matthew has tried to save it, but it lives in infamy. 😏  Edit: These boys from Cork sound so similar to Patois! The Irishman is adjacent to the Jamaican patois.. Confirmed.
I can only understand half of what they say. I wish I had an accent like that XD
i find it sad that he didnt recognise the rubberbandits
We have the same thing with Newfies in Canada. Can't understand em for shit. And everyone else gets the accent wrong lmao
"GO BACK TO BED CHILD" that got me, wonderful way to tell someone to sit down xD
Disappointed u didnt know the rubberbandits
Jack you should watch this show called Letterkenny, it's a Canadian comedy and it's Hilarous
I love Sean's accent... Definitely the best 😘
Jesus I couldn’t understand anything with that one video until he translated it. That’s nuts lol
20:00 Rubberbandits reference!
People watching Wild Thymes:  Sean in the background: *irish giggling*
I loved the norther Dublin accent
ive been watching jack for so long that i dont even realize he has an accent, like i just dont even notice or remember that he does. idk its kinda weird, like im so used to it that i dont pay a lot of attention to it or smth idk if im making sense
This reminds me of the scene from Ralph Breaks the Internet when Merida was talking and we're like the hell did she just say
I live near ballyhaunis jack love ya scan
He left us out up north☹️ we're still Irish🇮🇪
Jeff: I don't find Irish accents sexy. I like them but I'm not turned on by them *me makes happy asexual noises* :D  Also I feel the same way about when people try to do an Australian accent and they all just talk like Crocodile Dundee. We don't sound like that at all. I mean we don't have different dialects (except for the Aboriginal peoples who absolutely all have different dialects of their collective language) but we don't all sound the same down here either.
No nuance November, Irish people have balls to say whatever they want cause they're confident most people won't understand anyway
He surely misses Ireland.
How good are the Dwarves Irish/Scottish accent in the Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings??
ah yes, farty five
im swedish and its not that difficult to understand these accents
I've figured it out, the Irish accent is to English what the Austrian/south German is to german
Allow me to transcribe that for you:      "Malala fine maffen them, das ridin', bjoen domin, anyone can see it, fine maffen them... Yeh! See! Sit down! Possible at night, thig be a full moon derawell night in ten shu te be a bright out in the godaniel n' go up in the mountains somewhere light sure. Well there was forty five sheep missing making the lyams and nyo with them the sheep let's come- let's come down to nice be two mollywag. Tem be done about it, nothing."  "It's not at all that difficult, all you gotta do is have a good jog. Have a good joggin'. Go at night, some wounds sigh night. Just put a dagger round him, put him on a trailer or walk him. Whoever was doing in njor fouk he's doing."  Hope that helps!
0:38 Jack gets angry at himself
Oh im so glad frostbit lad is on here
Proud to be a kerryman
He should do an Irish aceent Among Us stream. Only Irish gamers
My Irish friends can't even understand the farmer.  This defines the my English not good meme
Let's go Ireland
Unpopular opinion: I don't understand the whole sexy accent thing. Don't get me wrong it's interesting, but i don't see it as anything more than appeal thing. I mean to say the f or sa word but this youtube, gotta keep it pg. Would anyone like to start a talk about this? I'd like to hear other opinions about this topic.
8 live in America and am very irish , scottish and such it's weird how I understood the accents for the most part
Love this! Please do a part 2 and include the scenes from The Foreigner. Thank you!
Me -   Not One Soul -   Youtube - 8,000 views, 200k likes, #44 trending  Also me - Makes Sense
The God dam dart line has a different accent at each stop!
i dont like that the cartoon guy has balls
Every Irish person watching this is smiling rn haha
Try watching the boondocks saints it's one of my favorite irish movie
A very strong Scottish accent is very hard to understand as well, also wouldn’t mind seeing her lucky charms 😉
To be fair the lady didn't title, "How to do THE Irish accent".  She titled, "How to do AN Irish accent".  So if there are thousands of them its still accurate :p
Yes, I love this video
I absolutely loved this cause I'm meeting a bunch of Irish people and this helped
Thanks for repping the country lad
2:30 That's more Scottish than Irish.
Pleaaasee do this more
Uppp the rebels!!
Cant believe they used a picture of cobh for cork big up cobh
I could kinda understand
At first I thought you were Canadian
Up da deise
At least im 3rd
Something was bright...
That guide to Irish accents was great to listen to as a dubliner 😂😂😂love doing those accents hahahaha
why don't people put Wexford accents on the internet i'm from there and I've never heard it online anywhere
Jack is going to be laughing in the movie theaters 😂
When speaking in an Irish accent, try removing all other letters when you come across an R unless it’s an N or a D.
You're going to make another one of these videos.
me when i forget literally everything my french teacher said: 0:26
I'm American
Maybe it's because I've grown up around mumbling kerry farmers but the "Mad accent" video was really clear and easy to understand to me. None of the people in that vid mumbled, but those around me..... holy feck you'd think they were humming. It sounds like there's a few words scattered about some buzzing. And then..... there's the old kerry farmer who had a stroke and his lips can hardly move.
I love irish accents BECAUSE I hate them
The irish dude who lost his sheep ... had to be noglas grandfather or somthin because they sound SOOOOO similar in some parts
As a fellow Irish person. Can you do the honors of ending my suffering.
1:37 am i the only one who heard "why did you make me soup"
i could understand when he said sheep, missing, and 45
I love when jack does videos about Ireland and Irish things
Seán trying to sound like Christopher Walken trying to do an Irish accent sounds like Arnold Schwarzenegger and you can't change my mind
AY. Mr. pitt wasnt doing an Irish accent.
I'm welsh and i understood everything haha thats what 3 years in Ireland does for ya 😆
Jack, in Rockstars game Red Dead Redemption 2 there is a irish man named Shan
I like how Sean was able to understand the old man speaking gipperish and I'm Irish and I have 0 idea what he said
*Jack*-Satirically jokes about how Irish people run around in fields with their arms out to point out how false that stereotype is  *Also Jack*- I LOVEEE NATURE!!!!!!
hey, don't insult milk like that >:(
This is the first video to make me genuinely laugh until it hurts in like, four months.  Thanks Sean :)
"hello there" him : hi  my brain : "failiure" u should ave said General Kenobi
I kinda want to move now to Ireland
The shepherd guy killed me I could understand a little bit because the Newfoundland accent is a lot like an Irish accent crossed with a Canadian accent
Irish is the best
When you hear somen talking about the acent is when you realize how strange it is
There's a really good news interview you didn't cover (search ''The highest pub in Ireland reopens''). It's great, their accents are so thick, and then a dude randomly has a sheep on his lap half way into the interview haha.
jack: "What THe FuCK JEFF?!?!" XDXDXD
Jack is like when dads are trying to show you some classic that “he saw your age” movies
Irish accents & Australian accents suffer from this lmao
This is how I feel about Benedict Cumberbatch’s American accent lol.
React to the Olympic boxer from up the north 🇮🇪
Have to recommend to watch how to speak dublish by foil arms and hog
Why not a react to American accents? As someone from the south it tends to catch others off guard.
seriously im a huge majority Irish with full Irish relatives, these fake accents literally hurt
Every body out here with normal accents then there’s us welsh who speak in comic sans
Isn't Kevin from cork
I have left a comment Very pog
yep... doing an Irish accent is picking some idiosyncrasies, for the most part pick about 7 or so drop about half the H's in Th's and tend toward an upward inflection at the end of a sentence
DOESN'T RECOGNISE THE RUBBER BANDITS JACK YOUR NO LONGER IRISH MY GUY!!! 😳😳😳
oof
I'd love to know if Cara Delevingne's Irish accent in Carnival Row is any good
im gonna ask a cursed question, see it Sean..  Is an Irish accent just a mix of Scottish and British accents?
The fuckin lads down in the rosas will be good
I really couldn’t stop thinking about  legend of the leprechauns  It’s been years since I’ve seen it ah the memories
Hehe 690
Irish, Scottish and Aussie accent is the best, I love hearing my own accent, I'm Scottish. And least you've got Jamie Dornan in that first clip you showed. Can't get any more Irish than that
christopher walken as an irish man gotta be like trying to have arnold schwarzenegger as a friench man LOL
When I went to England for the first time I tried to talk to a cashier in second hand shop. He sounded exactly like that dude who lost his sheep and I couldn't for the life of me understand him😂😂
The 'mad accent' sounds exactly like my uncle! There are no complete words. Everything blends together. Not a soul outside the family can understand a word of what he's saying! XD I love him dearly but as a Newfoundlander and a drunk, there's not much hope of understanding what he's on about. Talking to him is like pretending you heard your parent speak to you while playing a game and hoping whatever you come up with as a response is vague enough to convince them you weren't spacing out.    On another note, Norman Reedus' "Irish" accent in my favorite thing in the world. I was cry laughing the whole way through Boondock Saints. Just beautifully awful!
Frostbit guy is northern irish and belive me when i say most of us hate our accents 😂😂
Me an italian: Nani.the. fuck.??
Idk if I say it wrong but I’m Irish and I say Ireland like our-lind and he said it weird in my opinion    Also 1. Do you think you’ll come back to Ireland  2. I hope he does more videos like this because he just does these good and I can laugh because I’m irish
11:53 When you mentioned “mirror”, it reminded me a lot of my own Wyoming accent. We shorten a lot of our words, drop a lot of “t”, “o”, and “ing” sounds. For example, mountain becomes “moun’n”, going becomes “goin’”, and have to becomes “haf ta”. We don’t have a very distinct accent, but it’s certainly (cern’nly) there. Ya just need ta lisn’n.
I want Sean to react to Scottish accents as well and see what he thinks, Scots accents are all so different and are nothing like the English accents.
Sean does a better Christopher Walken than Christopher doing an Jacksepticeye accent. and that Irish accent from RTE broadcast, sounds more Norwegian/rish to me. Laddy.
start drinking more milk bitch...  That bitch was kinda harsh man XD
If I'm being completely honest with Jack right now, I actually want him to speak with a stronger Irish accent like normally while he talks for a video because I actually love that accent! <3
E
why tf was on of the search results are "how to be Irish" im worried
Jack the frostbit guy is from Derry in N.I, technically Claudy but its like 20 mins away, my mum met him in the chippy in Claudy like a month ago
Ireland, the land of potatoes and rain (from experience lmao)
Ok so I’m from the Orkney Isles and all that I found out that strong Irish is just a more understandable version of Orkney mechanic:)   Oh and if you see this Sean : Hi  And: (why is Sean not spelt Shon as I think it should be.)
Mate, I am good at understanding thick accents, and I can only understand about two thirds of what that dude says.
Hur fan blev "swedish" de sjätte mest sexigaste språket?
music.......
Sean I understand your language 👍🏼
Sean-thank you for translating. I tried following it.
Im from kerry and yet i cant even understand that accent from the sheep farmer
Okay but Seán can you please review Jakers! The Adventures of Piggly Winks?? I LOVED that show as a kid
Bro that Irish Farmer accent . I understand nothing until Sean translate it . And come on farty-five ?
8:14 "Ooh could you wouldn't belong get'n frost butt".
Hey jack I feel offended I’m in bed drinking milk 🥺
The Spar bag on the head is a rubber bandits reference...
Umm, is it just me or is there something on Jack's eyes, specifically on his right eye. Well, his right, our left. Idk, it just stood out too me is all.
8:00 im very surprised the captions are on point.
Good to know you can safely travel from portlaoise to tullamore without breaking county restrictions according to the map FACTS used, i hail from offalaois myself. Leitrim, forget it. Split meath into 3 for the craic! Carlow will be missed.
Day 1 of asking Sean to play Bugsnax
2:20 sounds like Vinny from atlantis
Jack : "eat shit  France" Me who's French : dude...uncool
Did you say fuck Italy? I AM ITALIAN
11:47 loving the Northern Irish accent, from Derry myself
Fucking hell 😂😂😂 I thought us in Wales were bad 😂😂😂
Don't worry you are very easy to understand.
I know the frost bit man he's from my part of the country he has a music video out you should do a video on haha
So do we have to feel blessed bc we understand Kevin? Bc those Cork athletes... I couldn't understand even half of what they said.
"Farty five sheeps" The only one I understood was the first one 😅
By jases your great yourself Sèan
Y’all I’m so proud of myself I actually understood the rowers!!!! Being like what, 6% Irish? has finally paid off!😭😭😭
I am but I can't speak Irish
I started choking at the how to do an Irish accent and I’m not even Irish
We can not speak Irish
But... I already subscribed.
Bro you’re literally stealing videos from call me Kevin
Séan mc and cheese
Flour: Flair  Me: ???
Jack: GO BACK TO BED B**CH, and drink more milk Me who already did those things: I'm two parallel universes ahead of you
Honestly an Irish accent can be very attractive ♥️♥️
Honestly an Irish accent can be very attractive ♥️♥️
You should do a tour and do speeches in Irish secondary schools
I'm irish .and yeah OK
Is the guy at 6:00 speaking German? All I understood was sheep
haven't watched the video yet, but it reminded me of the scene with the old farmer and the dog in Hot Fuzz
I see how it is :( 0:24
We need more Irish Accent Videos 😂❤️❤️
sean: "im fcking great at this" bro ur literally irish lmfao
What's the craic lads. Ya wanna Goin  to the pub an have a few pints with the lads. Oh ya you see yar wan over there. Ya she's a right feckin ghoul.  That what the standard interpretation of the Irish Acent should sound like. Ya feckin langers.
Please, I need hours of this content
I think your accent is the best its easily impersonated and you can understand what it is that your sayin
8:09 "Oh, top 'o the mornin' to ya there Mr. Freeman"
7:55 you totally used to sound like that lol don’t lie
I'm not even Irish and I cringed.
Man, this is a great video. You should make more videos like this.
*Frostbutt*
I just want to watch Jack watch Snatch. Would be funny AF
some really thick accents sadly sounds like gibberish
That farmer's accent sounded like he wasn't even speaking English, it was like he was talking in an entirely different language.  Also it made me think of Boomhauer from King of the Hill.
Every video Jack mentions Hot Fuzz, I fall back in love with the channel again.
Irish people have the series accent in the world.  Evelin: Sweating in the background
Confused irish noises
I’m Irish and My whole family are and don’t speak like any of these
Nah us Scott’s have a much better accent
Hey Sean, can you speak Korean? Our tall Dutch queen said its really good, I'd like to hear it please
The only thing I can hear from the farmer is: mountain , sheep and 35
What do they mean Irish accent? There’s a new accent every 7 meters 😂
Why is Australia no. 5? Should meet a Bogan and then re-evaluate your decision.
I am from the Caribbean and I have an English accent
Hey wasnt Brad Pitt's character not speaking clearly kinda the point.
Jason Statham is in this! Yay!
There's a thing about Irish women that I absolutely love.
ok I am not educated on Europe history but I think it is admirable if that was their way of talking before the takeover
2:10 HE SAID IT! HE SAID THE TING!
6:08 are you sure that's english?
Bruh no joke I thought he said farty five
I never understand why they don't have actors from the ACTUAL country they are portraying lol.
0:05-0:11 Don't think I don't know who you're talking about there. I know for a fact that you're lowkey calling out two individuals in particular ;)
I’m Irish from Tralee co Kerry I haven’t a clue what ur mans sayin
If the Irish sheep farmers joined in the video where they had the blindfolds it would be gold
The Irish accent and Scottish accent are somewhat similar to the Jamaican accent and it’s so easy to understand half the time.
Jack you've got that lovely flat midlands accents
I would love to have a this Irish accent just to piss off people of them not knowing what the fuck I'm saying 😂😂😂
great vid! <3
-“If you try to find happiness through the pursuit of worldly things, it will elude you. The only way to find happiness is through the pursuit of God.”
I miss the LAUGH series
Thats not amish its german (5:05)
Finally an old-school youtube video by Jack. I'm happy
Looool it take Jack's translation for me to understand the old man loool
*whispers* Wolfwalkers...
The reason it’s hard to understand is cause they’re accent makes it so they don’t open they’re mouths a lot when talking, making it sort of “muffled” and hard to understand if you’re not used to it.
An entire rabbit hole of Irish. I LOVE IT!
"It's just M I and 15 Rs." I lost it xD this was hilarious :D
No one mentioned people from Co Mayo's accent ☹️
I’ve been sad lately and this is the video I so needed
Dublin cork Galway o conell street Waterford
Oh lordy, I'm planning to go to Dublin next year if things with COVID have cleared up enough ... and boy, I sure hope I don't happen to run across any people that talk like that sheep farmer while I'm there. I already have a hard enough time understanding people in the first place, without an accent so thick it sounds like you're speaking another language 😅😅 like, I literally understood about 20% of what that dude was saying  I'm not discriminating btw, I'm just saying so people don't come after me lol
I always loved it when Jacks accent starts to get more prominent whenever he either is with his Irish friends or making videos like this. So fun to listen to.
✨🐝Jack the vowel binder✨🐝
Mirrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
I'm Irish from Kerry
i unsubscribed just so i could resubscribe a second later because jack said to subscribe
If this is how irish people sound is jack even irish... I feel like i can hardly hear a accent from him lol
CHRISTH
....best video ever.
IRISH FOR LIFE BOYYYYYYYYYY
When he mentioned Stab City, I immediately thought of GTA 5
Irish feels like the Bavarian accent for Germans. Not even native germans would understand what they are saying, not even themselves. That's like a whole nother language coming out of peoples mouths.
You know Jack I'm 12 years old and I don't even know your longuage all that I know is that I understand what you say and you always say FU CK which makes things much better
Well, I have now discovered which breed of Irish accent our Newfie accents came from lol
Me an American trying to understand chinese.  "AAAAAHHHHHHH" Me trying to understand thick irish accents  "AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH" *dies*
i found out i’m  60% irish ☘️
Jack, you should do a video on the United States Appalachian accent. It's derived from Irish settlers, I think you'd have a good time with it. There's northern Appalachia and southern Appalachia. My family is from the north. We definitely have an Irish twang to our accent.
Newfoundlanders are just recycled Irish
America: [riots] France: [terrorism] Britain: [another quarantine] Ireland: someone lost some sheep in the south
this is how Scottish people feel like when our accents are in films
Coming from Newfoundland, I can half understand some of what they’re saying. I think that’s pretty good considering we can only half understand what people say over here anyways.
I accept you into Ireland :)
I want to show this to my boyfriend to see if he can try some of the accents. It will be funny to see because he’s British😂😂
I am the irishman and i am the cringeth
Honestly Jack U dont even sound that Irish to me. I can understand u perfectly.
Irish accent is fokin brilliant
see i'm an 67% Irish lad and that wos  hard for me but i got it down....... sortev
Do more irish vids man there so entertainin
Ure a traitor Sean u left us
The woman trying to teach the irish accent is literally teaching an irish accent (irish gaeilge language)
The woman trying to teach the irish accent is literally teaching an irish accent (irish gaeilge language)
Glad im not the only one that hates france
Had so many laughs during this!!!
You should review Flashback!Angel/Angelus from Buffy/Angel
I'm irish
Poor farty, I hope it finds its way back. Is sheep farmer a thing? Growin sheep on the fields. A bushel of sheep went missing.
Who else is Irish and ure dad talks like the farmer in the vid 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
ALSO I JUST SAW YOU REACTING TO THAT ACCENT VIDEO AND OH GOD-
Cut your hair and wax your face , you look MUSTY
You need to look up think newfie accent
15:53 I think he genuinely was trying to get a date from that
Here's the thing. I have been watching Séan for roughly 7 *years* so I understand exactly what he talks about. When you put on the "mad Irishman" I almost understood *exactly* what he was saying, word for word. At least I got the point.   Now that I'm thinking about it... I understood 9/10 things. Maybe I'm the crazy one! Haha.
i think i’ve heard some people from cork talk and i honestly can’t even understand a word those kids are saying
its gas that he thinks the south have mad accents sure down in cork we have very light accents but i think the mid of ireland and up north have very heavy accents
As someone whose first language is Portuguese I didn't understand half of this video. But I laughed anyways.
Y'all shud cheggout sum deep suthrn accents
The fact is that I can't tell what's wrong with the irish accent
I'm wheezing at this cuz my Irish self can barely understand
Jack Jack Jack! Remember the game Hiveswap you played 3 years ago? Act 2 came out recently! If you're still interested in it, could you please check it out? *Also you were the one that got me into Homestuck and I love you for that <3*
TIL 2 things: You make a better Chrstopher Walken than Christopher Walken makes an irishman.  Spoken Irish is the most efficient language on earth. Seriously, you barely move your mouth and lips to talk!
Avatar the last "Vowl Bender"🤣🤣🤣
I can do a Irish accent because I am half Irish- but I rather do a English accent while I’m at it
Wtf is that Irish guy saying
Use me as a “wtf” button
The Jacksepticeye impression that Sean did was OK
People that pronounce mirror as Mirr-Or and not mirr, then get out
WhaT THa foCK JeFf?!?!
DO ANOTHER ONE
The first news anchor sounded like RT
Haha i f*ing love this, i recently stumble upon your vids while watching Pewds, since i've used to watch him everyday a couple years ago, and recently got on to check his videos out and heard a funny bastard in the background sounding like an Irish, and i look at all your vids now, and i love em! i love u becuz of your accent and your humor and that u can laugh at your own expense ( Im trying my best to translate, im a swedish bastard, let me be :D) Keep up the good work :)
Hon hon hon hon hon
11:36 " I'm great at this"  - Jack who is an Irishman while trying to imitate the Irish accent.
I wish Sean reacted to The Irishman and laughed at it
How do you spell seans second name
M I R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R   Don’t count!! it’s 15 Rs
Engineer Gaming brought me here
I love the Irish accent! Yours is my favorite by far!
Up da ra
The Irish rower wearing the country's flag sounded like Kevin
Something clicked in my brain and I can actually understand them now. I have no idea how lol
The ‘frostbit’ video is actually the Northern Irish accent fun fact!
Irish accent literally sounds like people are speaking another language, Sean was actually converted into English for us.
Isn't pikey just supposed to be a made up accent?
oi jack I'm gonna keep it real with you hiveswap act 2 just came out and you kinda promised
Okay but... MY ACCENT IS IRISH AND SCOTTISH because my grandad it's Scottish and Norwagian. And my grandma is Irish so what score is my accent at???
I love the UK accent
This is why I love being irish 1 i can understand what my irish people are saying. 2 i can understand all our sayings and insults. 3 i can watch jack and not feel like the only Irish person here.
I'm Irish and I'm barely able to understand
What are they even saying?
It’s really “FON”
We let you win :D
that was fun
3:47 Is he the guy who played Handsome Rob in the Italian Job?
I wonder how many people could understand the Kerry farmer. Yeah, here and there I thought "what the fuck is he saying", but it wasn't that hard to understand for sure for sure.
Came for Jacksepticeye, Found Irish ASMR
The Newfoundland accent is technically a variant of the Irish accent. You should go down that rabbithole and try to understand what they're saying.
jack's like in court for doing something and his lawyer just goes: "your honor, my client says in his defense and i quote 'we irish people are just built different'"
That thumbnail looks like Sean's a dog tilting his head🤣🤣😂
Brad Pitt was not doing an Irish accent
I have not  watched him in  5 years
We are talking of a revolution not physical but psychological revolution where there is no, at the depth, conformity. Conformity exists when there is comparison but a mind to be totally free of comparison that is to observe the whole history which is embedded in you.
Hey Seán have you visited an Italian city along a coast yet?
ok, you need to take a look at the film Blown Away with Tommy Lee Jones and Jeff Bridges and the WORST accents ever!
This has nothing to do with the video...But I want to WARN you all in 💝. Please everyone choose Jesus as your Lord and Savior. All these natural disasters are lining up with Bible prophecy in Rev. We are getting closer to Jesus's return and judgement coming on the entire world. Please all repent with your mouth to God and admit we need a Savior Jesus Christ who died for all our sins. Believe and have faith in Jesus Christ and how he died on the cross for our sins and rose again. Invite the Holy Spirit ( being baptized ) into your life and turn from your sins. For those who don't repent and choose Jesus's gift of dying on the cross so we can have eternal life.. Things won't go well for them. I don't want to see anyone perish. I love you all, why I'm warning everyone daily and praying for the entire 🌎 daily. God bless you all!! I'm a sinner and I'm so grateful Jesus saved me from perishing. I keep seeking him daily and his commandments and they aren't burdensome, instead I have peace even when the world seems to be falling apart. God is on the throne, amen!! 🙏💐😊💝💝
Please try this with other accents
I'm a vowel bender 😂😂😂😂
french gets last on list revolution
I see Jack got this idea from his good old buddy Kevin
all i heard from this vid is jd djdvdbdkdudbrjdbsj
I thought i knew english until hearing Brad Pitt talking Irish
Shit I'm irish and 8 could barely understand the farmer lad
I feel like people doing an “Irish accent” and all sounding the same despite the multiple dialects and accents, is like someone doing an American accent and just sounding southern, or European and just going with German 😂
Dont know if anyone watches cody ko here but his product tier list he does an Irish accent that Jack needs to see
8:08 The grinch! But a little less green...
While Seán was translating for us he had GOD ENERGY and no one can tell me otherwise cause it’s FOOKIN TRUE
You know your man with the 45 Sheep I didn't know what the FUCK he said and I'm from Dublin XD
Whale Oil Beef Hooked
Jack, Hiveswap act 2 just released today. I would really love it if you made a series on it.
I think someone needs to stick a bunch of thick Irish accented people with some heavy Northern American/Canadian accented people, and challenge people to try and translate their conversation.
Jack! Hiveswap act 2 is out!!!
Brad pitt wasnt trying to be irish he was just talking fast...which now that i think about it is about 75% of the irish accent.
It's like watching actors try and pull off the South African accent. 🤣
Love this plike
When the guy said "everyone here speaks few octaves higher for some reason" That legit killed me😂
11:15 when Jacks says hes an accent bender, i swear i went straight to Avatar and "everything changing when Ireland attacked!"
Oh my gosh I was talking about Emily Blunt earlier today because she is on my top favorite actors list 😂 I hate Christopher Walken though lolllllll
19:12 ive never laughed so hard in my life
As an Irish man I relate to to this every time someone tries to do an Irish accent
Swedish is the seventh most sexiest voice, yay
Irishman with heavy accents: I am groot. Jack: ah yes, *SHEEP*
That farmer sounds like when you watch anime not in english
I hate where I live cause I use to have such a heavy Irish accent but then I moved to America and my teachers couldn’t understand what I was saying so my parents made me talk American
I fell like his youtube is like why is an irish man looking up other irish people
Dang jack's pretty good at doing an irish accent
Seriously what angry ass people dislike Sean's videos 😂
jeez, somebody please show him the Irish Pingu
I’m not Irish but I’m cringing so hard rn
Am I the only one from America who has been dying to either 1) have an Irish accent or 2) go to Ireland?
hey Sean i just found out that rock of ages 3 is out. you should play it (if you want to).
Should I be worried that I could understand  Everybody in this video Including the sheep farmer And I didn't need Jack's translation
If I laughed any harder, my head would explode. That last one was hilarious!
Im Scottish and Irish but mostly American...my accent isnt that strong bit still there
Damn  This dude's gettin old
clickbait he understood it all good vid tho
The first one they sound more Scottish then Irish
Im from northern ireland which is right beside ireland. I wish i was irish 😢
I lost it with “Vowel Bender”. This video is great.
I Don't Know What The Farmer Is Saying, But I love it
I’m from cork and I can’t u understand a word he sounds like pint man paddy and someone from Liverpool
I want an Irish accent...
Where I live on the news some douche burned a bunch of honeybees and now is in trouble with authorities... WELCOME TO OHIO!!!!
It would be really awkward if no is when we find out he's not really irish
Ахахахаххпхаахпхп
Whenever the Cork accent is mentioned I can't stop thinking of Jock and Connor from young offenders :)
I kinda wanted to see him react to conor mcgregor’s accent 😂
I heard of this movie before
Jack! You should do a Try Not To Cringe (Proposal rejection edition)!!!!
I am in actual shock that Jack translated the Sheep Man
you should play happy wheels again... I LOVE THAT SERIES!
All i heard herfgsfehkufwafeyi
My Scottish accent always comes through more when speaking about it too,  and to the  people who say our accents are the same, they rlly aren’t lol
THE MAD BOLLOCKS LEFT THE NORTHERNS OUT
Irish man learns Irish accent
Lol I cannot understand the individual words Irish farmer said.... But the Irish in me knew exactly what he was on about
19:12 sounds like terrioriser 😭😭
American English: "I'll knock your block off!"  British English: "I'll knock yer bloody teeth out! Put em up!"  Irish English: *Speaks in non-Euclidean geometry*
It sounded like jack said farty five
chrishtopher walking impressioned by jack, start to sound like Arnold Schwarzenegger.
Irish Crisiphar Walkin sounds like Arnold Swartzinagor
Dear god. Don't ever let jacksepticeye to forget his irish accent. Its pure gold.
i laughed the entire time lmaoo
Bro call me Kevin much
Well I have a thick farmer kiel Irish accent. I say sweet like skwayt
Brad Pitts one sounded like a dublin accent change my mind
when he talked about Cork all I could think about was CallMeKevin
Only a native Irish man could translate another native Irish man's tongue 🤣💀
Did I just watch Seán be homesick for over 20 minutes??
Varför skriver du inte svenska?
I’m from Dublin originally and now live in Louth but a Louth accent does not sound like that guy
You said your accent gets thicker— just as I was thinking exactly that.
Dude he said that he lost 45 from the mountains
Jacks shirt is a top of the mornin shirt
Lmao, vowel bender :') contanants beware! XD
GO DRINK MORE MILK BITCH me who cant drink milk bcs the doctor said so and i trust his medical opinion as he studied medicine:  ;-;
I'm Irish and people who impersonate me piss me off so much
Casually waiting for Jack to play Hiveswap act 2
19:19 Woah at first I actually didn't realize that he stopped the video started talking :D
My God I wish I was Irish
Seamus from Harry Potter
I remember my great gradnpa his accent was so bad.  My family from Ireland also  Donahoe or odonohoe is surname
You could do like 5 more videos of this and I would watch every one of them. I'm an American Linguistic major with Irish heritage so I LOVE listening to the different types of speech.
when he gets low and starts speaking in the high accent and im shook lmao
Ok but why half way through the video did I start to understand everything they're saying?
I just noticed the board on 4:42
Jack does a better Christopher Walken impression than Christopher Walken does an Irish accent.
as a person who can only access their Irish accent when angry- this was funny af to listen to. I am Irish descended along with Norse and Scottish and these accents are so thicc its just beautiful
The voice of John Sharpson in a Jacksepticeye video is great. I still hope for a future Try channel and Jack collaboration some day.
The boy in the snow... PURE BALLEYMENA, I’ve actually never heard anyone under the age of 50 with an accent that strong. Pure Northern Irish farmer accent 😂
hey jack whats the craic. ah and dont worry us English are  slowly invading Ireland  lol :D
i dont think the people speaking even know what they're saying
Jack reacting to two people trying 2 to do an Irish accent has the same vibe as me reacting to people trying to do an English accent other countries assume did everyone speaks the same everywhere when every place has a different accent
even the fcking subtitles couldn’t understand irish shepherd for fucks sake XD
Lmao seán Mac an tSITHIGH sounds like he’s trying to speak welsh in a Scottish accent 😂😂
plot twist: they don't actually say top of the mornin to ya on the daily
The reporters last name was "SIT HIGH" what a name wow
Me just eating my food and drinking my milk  jack-“start drinking more milk b*tch” me*takes a sip of milk*
He blushed
Snatch, Hot Fuzz.... Classic movies
i am sorry this is such a good video jack i can't get over it
Jack hiveswap act 2 is out you have to play it!!
Yeah there are millions of Irish accents in Ireland, there's at least one for each county. Some Irish people can't do other Irish accents. I think my favourite accent is from tipperary, I live in West kilkenny so I have a mix of two.
I literally watched that one tutorial lady because I had to play an Irish person in a musical, I was like “oh yeah I sound pretty good” a tragedy really
Idk they all sounded Irish to me and I should know cause im  Australian 😉
Hahaha Northern Ireland gang
i want to hear an irish accent so thicccc so aggressivee it sounds like you're murdering sound itself
Don’t call the guy at 5:10 Irish. He is from The North
Christopher Walken pauses while talkin, that is all thank you
Can you do Mexican hard accents
is jack getting  grey hair?
we need an accent👏review👏
Jack:Start drinking milk little frik. Me:ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Anyone else thought the farmer was talking some other language?😂😂that was a heavy accent
Lolz he should rate the kiwi accent and how we speak in general lolz. It is so different in evry town. :p
The farmer sounded like he was speaking german so then this poped into my head IRISH HITLER
10:50 ....oh no she didnt......
jack hiveswap act 2 is out. pls pls pls play it :))
I reckon Irish, English and French are the best accents. Literally all next to each other as well. I'm English so I'm biased I guess.
The heavy girl was hilarious.
in 11th grade, we went on a school trip to Ireland after having learnt English in school for like 9 years and although I had like B2/C1 skills at that point I felt like I didn't know that language AT ALL xD Edit: Maybe I should mention that I'm from Germany. Also, I have adapted a mixture of accents from all over the world (mainly from the UK though) thanks to youtube :D
That man with less sheep sounded like someone out of a Tolkien book to me... xD
The two silver medalists talked without their mouths moving. Like wtf? All the while sounding as incomprehensible as possible. Jesus Irish people are hot
Does anyone else notice Sean  might be wearing eye shadow or is that just me
the vocal coach says "oirland", most dubliners would go "arrland", but the americans go "aierland", which is by far the most hilarious to think of
My mood in this video went to HAHA FUNNY to NO ENTIENDO NADAAAAAAAAAAAA (I don't understand)
lmao not even callmekevin could understand the farmer, jack's got some mad skill
you are trying to learn irish because you think you are irish but ireland english séan means in Swedish is du försöker lära dig irländska eftersom du tror att du är irländsk men irland engelsk séan in Swedish
FROST BUTT
0:06 insert unus annus video "1 man 100 accents here" oh wait
if i try to do a irish voice it will sound scottish as all fuck
Jack played with other Irish people Jacks Irish intensified
Does it count if in 45% Irish
I'm always told In Scottish I'm irish
Sean The sexiest Irish accent is by Peter in the haunting of Bly manor change my mind
Just leave the Irish accent to irish ppl please
As an irish lad🇨🇮 i can confirm it was diffrecult to understand some of these accents
Hey I just remembered your birthday is feb7 and I got super excited because my birthday day is the same.
It’s always the southern accents huh? 😂 in American our southern accents can go crazy too
me saying mirror..... murrrrr
I don't know how. I don't know why. But I understand it 😂
When he said he was a vocal bender and had the avatar arrow on his face I just died😂 I had tea in my mouth too and it was painful
I do love learning about various accents in different countries, and the Kerry and Cork ones are fantastic!
Am I the only person who wants part 2 of this?
18:23 The guy: tankyou Me: *immediately thinks of daithi de nogla
i got a feckin potato ad, lads, i’ve peaked
This guy has a true irish accent and I am Irish
US SCOTTISH FOLK WOULD BEAT THE SHIT OUT OF YEEEE luv your vids :3
Oh lord XD The farmer sounds like he's speaking backwards and full speed.
Can you make a 10,000,000 rap like h20 delirious
I feel like trying to learn a new language made my listening skills loose enough to catch hard to understand phrases instead of listening for a word pronounced they way I would expect
I was born in Clare, my family moved to England when I was a year old, so I only say a couple of things that actually sound Irish, but even I sound more Irish than yer one from Kerry.
Oi!
When he said go back to bed child. Well for one I'm still a kid and I'm watching this in bed *I am 4 parallel universes ahead of you*
Sminky shorts would do the jobbb for you hahahaha
The rock around the neck part rly sounds like doofenshmirtz

I’m Scottish and I’m proud
Ah yes give me a usb with nothing but jack talking and thems some white walls
Lads I don’t go around saying ‘oiland’ is there something wrong, I say it like ‘are-land’, just me?
Is funniest home videos here
I feel that the bit about so many different dialects is the same for the UK and ROI it is just so packed
My dad and I are from Dublin and my mum’s from Cork but he still can’t understand some of her friends. We just are built different
JAAAAAAACK Hiveswap act 2 is out
My coding teacher is an Irishman, he’s cool af but I’m starting to feel like Ireland is the loudest place on earth after hearing him, Sean, nogla, and Brian (terrorizer).
I feel like his accent enhances when he is mad or scared like when he is playing Among us and he gets mad bc he gets voted out or when he is playing a horror game with his buddies.
The that lady pretending to be from kerry is so cute ;3;
Jack translating is literally the scene in hot fuzz
At 2:26 sean kinda sounds like Arnold Schwarzenegger
im a vowel bender LMFAO
he talks a couple syllabels out of sync
"flower, sour, our.......flr, sr, r."
Me an Italian watching this and knowing we are second in the sexiest accents : 🤌👁💧👄 💧👁 🤌
"M, I and 15 R's" 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
North side Dublin sounds like Cait from fallout 4
Definitely want more of this haha
I as an Irish person myself can confirm I have no idea of what they're saying
I feel like I listened to someone speaking in reverse.
I am only halfway through and feel like I have unlocked a new level of translation in my brain. Why can I understance the olympions?
*Sean saying how bad the accents are* Me who cannot distinguish his accent from the people in the videos: *chuckles awkwardly* yeah... sounds terrible.
Who knows what kinda mic Jack is using?
He didnt pick up one the rubber bandits reference XD
If the Irish accent is music it is literally just 100 Gecs
Um...that movie's title is already taken by a band called Wild Mountain Thyme. Don't believe me? Look up the moose song.
seeing him saying that they have a heavy accent, from an English boi like me it sounds like what I think they would sound like.  I've been lied to my whole life!! I can't even trust myself. (but fureal I thought thats just what they sounded like not that they had a super heavy accent)
when i heard the farmer talk i thought he was from Asia XDD
I was laughing the entire time. This was so fucking funny omg
The Irish farmer sounds more Japanese accent edit: until the latter half
that schoolboy sounds 80
Why can I understand those super irish accents? I'm american-
Me being from Cork finds this fucking hilarious, especially Americans trying to do an irish accent.
i- okay my mums from monaghan my dads from cavan my accent is a weird mix of both in monaghan I'm made fun of for sounding like I'm from cavan and in cavan I'm made fun of for sounding like im from Monaghan but.... that farmers ... im lost I understand you 100% but I understand  everything else so far ahahhaha
My sister calls these accents ruddy wanker lol She's been to both Ireland and Scotland almost went to school in Scotland also those farty  five sheep ? That's alot of possibly smelly sheep missing
Ight, I'm not even Irish, but these are pretty bad
Is that even english
i barely understood a simple word lol i didn't even master the english lmao
I lost it at the cork accent I have relatives down there that I've been told have the posh version so I dont hear the normal one often sounds like there havin  Some great craic there
Video: Bad Irish accents Brad pitt: *Drinks* Jack: *Laughs* That's pretty fuckin good
Trying to be Irish is like trying to be English. Or British. Or German. Because when it comes to us Irish people we all have different  accents like I'm from Limerick. And my accent is- Actually I remember my mom said my accent sounded like I was from cork- But anyways- Every single state has an accent and oh my god these peoples fake accents sound nothin' like em'.
JACK!!! THE NEW HIVESWAP GAME IS COMING OUT!!!! REMEMBER ACT1???? ACT 2 COMES OUT TODAY!!!!!!
You should just spend a full video reacting to kilnascully irish program for who doesn’t know it
im french come on give respect ---------------->>
Why am I even here? I have a test tomorrow. I don't even know what's irish
Jack: *translates* Me: wait, you can actually understand him--
hey sean, have you seen the boondock saints? care to give your thoughts on the accents in that movie?
Im not from ireland but i want to move there when im financially stable enough to XD and i have irish in my blood
Jacks "Irish" accent sounded like a New York accent to me.
Try understand Northern Ireland accents
Also I learned that Irish must speak two languages first Irish and Gaelic Irish
Jack! Cody Ko featured you in a video
"I'm a vowel bender!"😂😂😂
Norwegian accent should be the best.
When you pause a jacksepticeye video, 5:47
Google translate: struggling to translate   Jack: step aside,
Hey man just wanted to say I have been here since 100k I love you and will never stop loving you
im from dublin but moved to meath when i was 2 and ive been alive for years and my American friend tried an irish accent and it was very bad haha
Ya can’t beat the cork accent
Bring back jackseptiiceyes funniest home vids
Can you give me some teacher Miss Sam for the shout out she subscribed to you
XD I cannot speak a bit of Irish yet I understand what the dude at 6:56 is saying. Welcome to Michigan, where we speak to each other like this: “Wirbekfbskrboedbktbe.” And understand what’s being said.  Edit- at 10:35, Jack turns into Dream.
I am Irish coat
Play bugsnax, you might like it 👀
WHAT IS THAT MOVIE CALLED?! I HAVE to watch it. It has Jason Statham in it!!
Theres a lake here in shelton washington called lake limerick
I am pretty good understanding different accents, but Southern Irish folks just make my eyes cross.  Of course that where my family was from as well.
HAHA THIS GIGGLES MY FIDDLE
ok im from limerick in ireland and i can only understand 50% of what the kerry farmer on rté
Im from fucking northern ireland and i can't understand shit of what these guys are saying
YES, that IS how we see you :D
The sheep video just sounds like Sean streaming with his Irish friends
Can confirm irish accents are super hot
19:22 if you dont look you dont know jack started speaking
Northern Ireland accents are a cross between roadman London and Irish accents lmao
North side Dublin girl would certainly get my "south side" doublin in size...
Who else turned on translation?
Haha eat shit France! I am dying 🤣🤣🤣
I never thought that my irish accent was really strong, except for my scary flat dub phase. But then I went to America in 2018 and people wouldn't stop asking me about my accent, I did get nice compliments though 😊
The farmers losing their sheep one, omg, Callmekevin had that one on his channel once. You translated better than he did lmao
Lol
To me, people who try to have an Irish accent, try to hard and push their voices too much that's why they are so bad
Somehow I forgot to visit this channel once in a while. But this kind of content never fails to entertain!
I haven't laughed like this in a while Sean, thanks a ton!
australia is the best accent
I love this video sm
people who ran to the comment section: 👁️👄👁️👌✨
I'm not Irish so why did I understand all of that XD
can i have a phone big willy will?
I can’t wait for the late late toy show
In class (in Ireland when I went for a few months) they’d show us videos of Irish people and ask about it to see if we’d understand, I remember a video about a government person and I could not understand a thing. They wanted us to understand so in case we needed help or something we could understand what the other people were saying and that’s so NICE BUT IT WAS SO EMBARRASSING WHEN YOU’D UNDERSTAND SUCH A DIFFERENT THING 😂
I could not tell when he paused the video if it was the video he was watching or it was just him.
My hurling trainer is from kerry and I swear to God not a single person on the team understands him..
5:31 I’m Irish and even I can’t decipher that accent. 8:07 that one is easier. 8:50 I’m used to a cork accent, still kinda hard to understand.
11:50 you 100% sounded like your from Ballymena
Well then WHY THE FOOK DID YOU MOVE AWAY
as an american, it’s not necessarily difficult it’s just a matter of taking the easy way out
Everyone google "Why is my pee red?" At 6pm GMT on December 1st to confuse search algorithms     (this is copy pasted from r/madlads and if you want to help us achieve this goal, you can copy that top part and paste it on any videos you want)
No one:  Jack: I am great at being irish
That mountain movie brings up a problem I have with casting actors of different nationalities. I looked it up, and it does indeed have some Irish actors, but Christopher Walken is American
More Irish videos! I love Sean diving deep into Ireland related things
Seán you have to visit Westport, it's been voted Irelands tidiest Town and its so so nice!
Almost any language other than English is frickin attractive
Jack is banned from Ireland confirmed.
I went to Ireland for 8 months 4 years ago and I still remember when I was babysitting 2 kids and when their friends came around I would speak with an Irish accent... IM FROM FUCKING MEXICO but I couldn’t control it, the kids were so confused!! Their friends even asked if I was Irish. The funniest thing is I CANNOT FOR THE LIFE OF ME DO ACCENTS, I don’t know why it came to me ONLY when the kids had visitors 😂😂😂
Jack im great at this  Everyone else we suck at this
I feel like I started having a stroke trying to understand what I THINK was english
Do a review of the show Derry Girls!
Me: northern Irish  Me: 😎😎 hello mr sheep man
react to niall horan
Jack you should try devil may cry 5 at least the demo  see if u will like it or not jack
Who the fool do they think we are like , bet she is from northern ireland
They sound scottish
10% English 90% Irish
Do we know what part of Ireland sean is from?
I love irish cause it just sounds like scandinavian-english. Which is what it is.
british accent got voted best   but any accent in the british isles is the best 🇬🇧 🇮🇪
Bys im from Tipp i have a thicc Irish accent
Dammit now I wish jack would do videos with his accent
Ok, I understood like maybe 2 or 3% of what the farmer was saying. I couldn't understand the rest, so I just ended up laughing because I just loved listening to his heavy accent!😂 I just love listening to the different accents of the world! It makes me happy anytime I hear an accent that is different from my own. A lot of times I don't know how to contain my joy and I just end up laughing.😂 The Irish was so strong at certain parts, I thought potatoes were going to start popping up out of the ground!🤣 I'm currently reading all of these comments, including my own, as if there's a little Irishman on my shoulder telling me what they say!🤣
You think that’s bad try coming to Liverpool and understanding the scouse accent
The fact that brad pitt played a knacker is just
Why do Irish people talk like they don't have lips
8:15 is that GMan
BRO PLEASE REPLAY DYING LIGHT. The story is fun but confusing at the start. Please!
Christopher Walken sounds more Welsh than Irish. Makes no sense
Lol I love you Jack ur great.
Among us prop hunt
This video was great. That's what it was, Seán
21 minutes of laughter. this was hilarious! have not watched this channel for 6 years or so but i think i am ready for another few years of jacksepticeye :D good job sean. EDIT: please make more of this :D
21:00 the Irish accent is the one
Boondocks saints is a good watch
The farmer sound like a human from TABS
hEIm jack septiceye-
Man: Speaks in a Irish accent that Sean can't understand Sean: *I SENSE A DISTURBANCE*
I couldn’t understand the man with the missing sheep but I could understand the rowers pretty well.
Drunk and slow
This was so much fun! I love listening to accents from around the world. I wish I could travel here there one day. I know I would piss off the people from there, because I tend to pick up the inflections of the people I am around if I am not careful.
It would be cool if Jack started a series all about reviewing Irish movie accents.
A man who tried to hide his accent, now making fun of other people’s😂
My moms cousin spent some time in Wales and some guy was talking to her at a pub. She had absolutely no idea what he was saying, but she was sure he was speaking English
this video made me stop crying, thanks
what did you do with that mans sheep, Jack?
wtf svenskar är på 7th plats hur fan 0:24. just google translat it if you wanna know what i said
I love that scene from hot fuzz, I die laughing every time 😂
14:00 This. This little accent quirk right here is why I'm _fascinated_ by Irish accents. I reckon it's also why it's the "most sexiest" accent. There are alot of satisfying sounds in the world (a cat's purr, light rain on the roof, bowling alleys) but this? This is one of my favorites.
I like female Aussie accents just sooo good.
Kevin did this
*flashback to the Unus Annus episode where they tried to mimic an Irish accent*
6:55 Irish Tom hanks
You should react to a donegal accent it's the funniest thing skann
Everybody welcome to Jacksepticeye steals a Call Me Kevin video idea clip for clip lmao
Has Sean ever tried an American accent? Like an honestly trying one. I wanna see that
*Jaaaaack*
Impossible
In the farmer one
I heard bright out 45 missing and mike🤣
my great grandma has a hella thick scottish accent, and its really funny to watch my uncle's fiancee pretend to understand what she's saying
isn't the sheep dude the guy that callmekevin couldn't make heads or tails of.
Good
I'm more British  but I'm Irish
Wonder what they all sound like when they are all yelling
This is why I love jacksepticeye what is because he'd Irish
FARTY FIVE is a lot of sheeps indeed
He sounds like a speedy auctioneer
wait hold up ur 40 ?????
Lol. I'm American, and... I fully believe Irish accents are the best. I grew up in the south. Some of our accents are... tough to understand too.  Sean, have you seen the Try Channel?! And also, you don't sound hard to understand ever, except when you're streaming with the Irish lads! I feel like all of you get a THICKER accent over the course of your stream. :)
I want somebody to clip “haha eat SHIT France” so I can send it to my French teacher
oooo poteto cantri yes
I feel like the Irish accent is what “Drens” is to the Dutch language
Absolutely accurate that when people do accents they just do generalised ones. Everywhere has hugely different accents depending on areas. I think where I am (australia) is probably the least varied though for size, for us it’s just like east coast and west coast mostly. Everywhere else it’s like drive an hour and everyone sounds completely different
Teach us your ways then Master of the Irish Accent! Please make a video with the golden knowledge of the Emerald Isle!
Cut the ponytail
*Meanwhile my country makes shitty comedy movies*      I only liked one movie made by turks and that was Ayla
The strong accent just sorta sounds like they're putting minimal effort into actually sounding out the words... Kinda like if you F up and someone asks about it after, but you're embarrassed or something so you explanation comes out as a muffled jumble of excuses. 😂
If you liked the Facts video you should try the Try Channel. Facts, as a channel, died some years back and so most of the talent went to Try instead! Beautiful and wonderful people they are. :)
anyone else been subscribed before he hit 7mil or is that just me
Top o' the Mornin' to Yeh is to the Irish as cowboys are to most Americans.
Ya im from cork and i had no idea what you man from the sheep one was saying XD
WOW
11:28 Perk, Gerden  CallMeKevin: For Feck Seyk
No one: jack: mirrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
Kerry is nice. i went to kerry before the lock down and i was clue less also i’m Irish so yes i some Irish people do have a hard time understanding
I died when you said vowel bender🤣🤣🤣🤣 Great job with the editing whoever you are! 👍🏻
The lad from kerry haha. Swear people in the pubs there actually sound like that. Thats what i like about my home though.
"Go back to bed, *child.*  Drink more milk, bitch."  My new favourite insult to ever leave Seán's mouth. 😂😂😂
Eat shit France 😂🤣😅 I'm kidding France I love you guys
Didn't jack sound like "irish swarzenegegger"
I don’t know why, but I fucking hate the movie just because I know that jack is the only Irish accent that is ok.
Im irish and I still can't understand the sheep farmer
We've seen this one about the sheep
Yes, this is what I needed today. 21 minutes of bad Irish accents that jack tries to understand.
At first I thought he said the interview was with the Irish Rovers, but after a second realized he said rowers.  Maybe it's just my Irish heritage, but i understood some of the sheep farmers and most of the frostbit boy.
The limerick accent from the guide to irish accents vid is just blind boys accent 😂😂😂 Also the guy with the spar bag on his face IS blind boy from the rubber bandits!!!
10:45 oi vey!
8:16 "getting froosbutt"
0:05 - flashbacks to the Unus Annus accents video 👁👄👁
*laughs as Jack's accent just gets stronger and stronger through the video*
I’m FROM Kerry and I’ve never heard a Kerry person speak like that she is 100% raised by British people or born in England or something???
The worst Irish accent I've heard was the guy who played Jimmy o'phelan in sons of anarchy
I think Irish accents are just so pretty. I love listening to them, and I don't hear them nearly enough living in a small town in the US. Jack is the closest I can get most of the time, although I watch the Try Channel, too.
I hear frickin Arnold Schwarzenegger
As a man who’s lived in Scotland his entire life, I have no god damn clue how we even got in the top TEN sexiest accents
you should so play skate 3 again and/or gta 5
in my opinion that the irish accent is just like a really really lazy and drunk englishman who tried to explain to the police what the fook is he doing in the middle of the night
Grandfa!!!!
I kind of understand
I'm Irish and that's fucking hard to understand 😂😂😂
As someone who lived in Cork, I can confirm; those accents are THICC
jack, follow your heart, go back awhile. why not?
Same energy as “British accent”
Look at this flerrrs over therrrrrrr
19:27 Jack went SCOUSE
Ok but you need to see the accents from burn notice. They are pitiful.
One thing I fucking hate too is how the rest of the world thinks Ireland is just dublin and everyone speaks with a dublin accent. WE FUCKING DONT
how to do an irish accent: Step 1 - HAVE AN IRISH PERSON DO IT!
Jack please finish Superliminal
Being from cork this is just hilarious to listen to
Hey Jack ik it's not the best video to be make a sad comment but...  I'm struggeling rn and ik you're not gonna read this but my life is going downhill rn...I don't see a single thing that is worth to be alive my motivations is draining...i just wanted to let you know your videos brightened my mood and comfort me in any way possible  Thank you for being here
I love Jack doing my northern accent 😂😂 8:40
Im an american but i still wanna watch wild mountain thyme
The old sheep owner sounds like a german
Oh dear me
0:40 😂
I moved to Kerry from limerick when I was 13 and I’ve never felt so out of place because I have a limerick accent and every old Kerry man sounds like the sheep man 😫
I miss the outro 😕
Honestly, the rowers and the schoolboy weren't that bad. Those farmers, though, I thought the sound file must've got distorted.  Also, I watched that vocal coach lady's video on Southern accents, and ran into the same problem. She used what we down here call "The Southern Belle", and then generalized it, as if that's the only Southern accent that exists.
what a fun video. Thank you for guiding us through this tour of Irish accents. I love to hear how bad Hollywood does accents sometimes.
I’m French and I think we are pretty sexy even tho Latinos are the sexiest
should’ve watched Pixie the movie and judged their irish accents
Hi Jackaboy
Come back to irland
He said it'd be bright at night and anyone could be coming up the mountains (im live commentating so stay tuned folks)
No accent in existence: Not even Egyptians: Irish people: Farty-five.
U NEED TO REACT TO TRINIDADIAN ACCENT!!!😄😄😁😁😁
At 7:20 didn’t anyone else see the video that said Irish farmer eats raw sausages
I made it here exactly a day late
No u dont I feckin love ur accent mate
I've been binge watching Eurogamer for weeks just to listen to Aoife Wilson.  So worth it.
Sean please do a part 2 I'm actually weak I can't stop laughing u have made my day
I dont ✨u n d e r s t a n d✨
I'd love to see you try to narrate a movie Jack 🤣
Brad Pitt plays a traveler in snatch to me it's accurate enough with the travellers I've had the (unfortunate) pleasure of meeting
I have a yeehaw accent and sometimes irish
I love Irish so much, it is literally hilarious because for us not speaking that language it just sounds like a baby that haven’t learned his / her first words and is just mumbling REALLY heavy words like the SSSsssss at the start in 5:50. 🤣😂👏🏻
jacksepticeye : Irish people don't say top o the mornin to ya  all his old videos:
I like limerick cuz rubberbandits are from limerick
I would like to think I'd do pretty well understanding Irish people if I'd ever went to Ireland, but listening to some of these accents... just.. no. No I would not. I'd just spend my entire visit looking lost
Jack should play rdr2
Can u like upload a Irish lesson video?
OMG WILD MOUNTAIN THYME I LOVE THAT SONG!!!!!!!
If there is one Irish accent I love listening to, it's Dara O'briain's
why the fuck do you still add backround music to a commentary video so annoying
As a person from kerry I have no idea what that lad said
Sean I love frostbit 🤣
The fact that I got an ad in Spanish after the video ended 😂 What does that say about the Irish accent?
"Eat shit France" was the moment I decided that I do in fact like Jack.
I thought I recognised your accent! My family is from Clara, Offaly. u sound like home
and here i thought it was impressive that i could understand donald duck... some of the heavier accents in this i could only get every few words
Me: sees no damn difference Sean: OH MY GODS
This video makes me want to travel to Ireland so badly!
Does.. does sean have make up on his eyes?
Is it bad that i can fully understand the guy from kerry btw im from cork so maybe thats y
Even if ya moved away - we still miss ya Seán :)
Plot twist: he has the original Irish accent and jack was just too dumb to understand
As a Greek that has English as a second language I don't understand anything.
5:50 I didn't know the Irish had their own language. I thought this video was about accents not the Irish using their native tongue
If u can't understand Sean obviously something is wrong because I've been understanding him for the past 7 years since I was 7
I feel like no one without the real Irish accent can do a good Irish accent (belongs to Being Scared )
i irish and  11:55 no just no...
the magic of youtube is: there's a close caption. no matter how weird your accent is.
This reminds me of how my grandparents talk. They're not Irish, they're from Newfoundland, but what Jack was saying about every other town having a different accent? Same type of thing.  Totally different accent, but that's what it made me think of
I think every Irish person from Ireland will appreciate that he stopped before going up north.
In English we say "I" But in Irish accent we say    *Ö I*
Soo what I learned from this one is that Jack likes an Irish accented hole ?
farty five sheep???? no way
I'm irish
I have never smiled so long and so hard in my life 😹 Thank you!
Oh man I was thinking the hot fuzz episode as well xD I'm the country bumpkin translating normally.
Jack I understand I lived in the Philippines each island has a different language
s  h  e  e  p  .
Little did we know that accent was the bigger barrier than language.
As an Irish person, the Hollywood Irish accents are ridiculous, but I was laughing at the end with the clip of actual Irish accents. They were so on point for us 😂
for some reason i can understand, and i am scandinavian
I was about to be like “why is Irish the sexiest? That had to be wrong” and then remembered I literally fell in love with a dude because I thought his accent was so adorable... fine I guess you guys win  It’s hilarious tho he’s a weird mix of 8:08 and then super posh British😂 poor guy, tries so hard
Sean didn't you vlog yourself basically running around in a field years ago? i kinda remember something like that
When your Scottish... 😔
Real Engineering I think it is sounds exactly like Cairn or however it's spelled.
*I ' M  A  V O W E L B E N D E R*   Fucking creased XD
I feel like your accent is very thin like it’s not a thick Irish accent I have never had a hard time understand you, you enunciate very well
Imma watch anything u upload
And btw we don’t talk like fkn leprechauns and we’re not all ginger and small 🤣🤣 sorry just had to put that out there
I confess, at times when I watch videos from those I'm subscribed to, I forget to hit the like button.

Am wonderin how much ar this al understand as a Scotsman. When a was in primary school thur wus an Irish member ae staff and a wus yin ae the few people thit didnae need um tae slow doon tae understand um.  That's was difficult, I'm too used to typing like this so people can understand me

Thoroughly enjoyed this video👌🏼
I’m Irish tbh that was easy enough to understand and no Sean u sound more American then Irish atm that’s not a bad thing 🤣🤣
Jack is that eye makeup?
......... is Jack wearing make-up???
petition for jack to make a video and having a very strong accent throughout
I had to concentrate so hard for the guy missing his sheep's but I got it
In the netherland there is something called twens and its a accent that can be realy strong 2.
When jack did a cork accent I died omfg
Being from the southern US I can relate to some of this. The sound and thickness of the accent changes wildly every hour you travel and actors can never do it justice.  My accent is such that locals think I'm a transplant in my hometown but if I leave the South I'm immediately clocked as from Georgia
7:53 yes you do sound like that. I'm sorry too. 🤗
The missing sheep one gave me brainpain
I smiled the whole video through
my sister lives in skibbereen
HOW WAS THE AUSTRALIAN ACCIDENT NUMBER FOUR ON THE SEXIEST ACCENTS The British accent wasn’t even on the list

REALLY LIKED THIS ONE
I only understood “Bright out”
Now do you doing a Swedish accent
7:44 I don't think you sound like that Jack, but overselling the accent is the only way I know how to do an Irish accent XD
Honestly my Favorite is jacks accent
Didn't know I got accents when speaking English until I travel oversea, speaking English and people pointing out there's unusual accents when I'm speaking English. Bloody hel'.
Who is the potato god? Jack or Nogla or Terroriser WHO DA POTATOOO GOD??
My man really said frostbutt
i'm kiding  i  am  AMARACAN
Go scotland 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
I could have sworn this was a CallMeKevin video xD
Oh my God that fucking farmer doesn't sound like having an accent just sounds like entirely different language
5:00 I think he’s speaking gaelic
She looks Irish but sounds British
Jack: I'll translate it to you Jack: *translates* Me: tf are they saying???
Pit sounds like a Newfie
I Bailey  promes  i  am irsh
That farmer sounds like he's speaking welsh!!
I'm like 100% Sure that 90% people who voted for Irish being the sexiest accent, only heard Jack's voice... And I'm okay with that.

Was expecting the video to be on Americans actors or people to trying to speak with Irish vids then we get the farmer and the Irish schoolboy and seeing Jack’s reaction just cracks me up harder. Especially with the vocal coach.
day 1 of asking Sean to react to welsh accent   ALSO SEAN YOUR GOING GREY🙀
Jon Snow has pretty decent Irish accent,  too bad he knows nothing
I would say “fuck you sean, I’m Scottish” but I’m Irish too
I understand everything in the old lad brown pants
Irish people just dont move their fucking teeth do they?
Jack: haha you sh&t french Jack’s french flag behind him: STOP IT
Gotta love some good ol boy border collies <3 (I have one, absolutely fantastic breed)
The only thing worse than Americans doing Irish accents is Americans doing Scottish accents
OH MY GOD I KEEP GETTING THE SAME GODDAMN JAGERMIESTER COLD BREW COFFEE ADD AHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAHAUHAAUHUAHAHHUAHDFUGHFJ
Moving to Ireland is sounding better and better... Also most of my family originated in Ireland and I am wondering what possessed them to leave... I have a bit of an accent and speak really fast as most in my family do,  but I am also very loud. I have no inside voice... It's good to hear others speak really fast in an accent.
This was posted on my birthday!
What I learned from this video:      *“h” = “haech”*
Can you play dangonronpa? I know it’s old, but still can you play it?
Remember doing orals and they’d make us listen to someone from Donegal speak it’s like listening to another fucking language
i've watched that video of the farmer with the mad accent so many times now that i can actually understand it and after all the laughs he just sounds like a sweet old man. hope his sheep are well lmao
In a general sense, ANYONE doing ANY accent that is not their own makes me cringe so hard😬
Please react to Scottish accents
All Irish people are confirmed Airbenders, they just do all their bending inside their lungs and vocal cords
Whenever I try to do an Irish accent it just ends up sounding like jacksepticeye
I think having the Lads react to this would be a good video.    *Nogla and Terroriser: Rehsism*
why did that guy have the spar logo on his face??? :)
5:05 it is easy he is speaking German
The Irish accent isn't elusive, it's just extremely slippery
That guy on the right who won the silver medal has a thick irish accent but talks like he’s from norway
Why'd you cut out the northern accent? Coming from south Armagh, idk, seems a little bit offensive
Great! Now I want him to record a "How to do Irish Accent" video xd
Idk If anyone has said this already but a *thicc* Irish accent always sounds like the backwards voice filter on snapchat its hilarious xD
I'm sorry but if I was lost in Ireland and someone found me with a heavy accent I would die of laughter before starvation 😂
Isn't Jamie Dornan Irish? So maybe they got one irish man for that first movie you looked at 😆
Being from cork I can confirm were the most tapped people you’ll ever meet
This makes me scared to visit my family in Ireland 😳
React to dublin drill BTW from Dublin
"why don't they use Irish actors" Me aa a scottish person, "welcome to the club"
I'm 7.5% Irish, Welsh an Scottish! Me accent is grreatt!
As a Cork man I absolutely can confirm we all speak at least 4 octaves higher than the rest of the country lol
oh god sometimes being Irish is the best thing in the world😂🇮🇪
Irish guy watching.... Hilarious > Cringey
For a part 2, I really recommend looking at the Sminky Shorts animations YouTube Channel! Best Irish accents :))
Jack: *talking about irish accents* His inner viking: LET ME IIIIIIIIIIIINNNNN
I HAD TO WATCH THAT MADELINE GIRL'S VIDEO A FOR A THEATRE PRODUCTION AT MY SCHOOL I-
John dimadon onwer of the demsdal demadon
The only thing I understood frpm that third video was SHEEP
Irish and Scottish people are casted out and made fun of but it is because our accents are far to complex
Its the townie huars that ruin the accent
Innit that that schwetupid jason staham
The song
JACK PLEASE MAKE A OUTER WILD PART 4!!!
All the way
The more i listen to irish accents it always seems strangely familiar to a Canadian one. Take away the cursive in irish and its basically Canadian
Sean you should play genshin impact 😼
I had no idea there was such a wide range of accents, and can I just say the farmer actually being named Mikey Joe O'Shea is so great. I would watch Irish TV about sheep theft with the subtitles on ALL DAY.  At this time I would also like to plug the movie the Secret of Roan Inish and endorse the general concept of singing loudly in pubs.
BrO cAn YoU EvEn AcCsENt
An Irish man reacts to Irish accent.
By jaysus me da sounds like mikey Joe
TBF in Snatch they did say it didn't sound like Irish accent
"Haha eat shit France!"  -The British every day for like, a thousand years
Bruh, what the fuck, I literally watched that video yesterday because I wanted to show my sister a true Irish accent, and few hours later Jack uploaded this :O
irish man: frost bite? no no no, frost butt.
19:47 The guy with the Spar bag on his head is one of The Rubber Bandits, they're from Limerick and they wear plastic bags on their heads
Is no one going to talk about jacks translating skills 😳
What's happening
hahahaha ah sure im from limerick aswell bai
It's hilarious
He complains about the cold, doesn't wear an overcoat and gloves, he deserves to be frostbitten.
Listen to in 1.5 speed and nothing is understandable.
Disappointed CallMeKevin, the most *Irish* sounding person wasn't here  (Obviously jokes, where is that man's Cork accent at all, at all??)
I love these sorts of videos because people who impersonate other accents really tend to overdo it.  I feel like this is true for most, if not all accents, but it was fun watching a true blue Irishman laugh at the bad Irish impressions.
I love all your Ireland videos. Its the best content!
What county are you from
How the blazing fuck does an Aussie accent come anywhere near sexy? Have they heard an aussie bogan speak?
Brad Pitt was playing a Irish gypsy so that’s why he sounds like that
"Why don't the hire irish people?" Poor Jamie Dornan who is irish sounds put on! As a scottish person, I feel your pain and cringe.
They say the history of the language of Ireland is an extension of English...how tf did we get here?
As someone who learned english in school and thought they were pretty good at it, this video crushed my self-esteem :D
I’m Irish and I’ve never found a video so funny haahahahahahahaahah
Oh god! I haven't laughed this hard in a long time! This video was comedic genius from start to finish. I loved every second of it!
Have you ever watch to lol( life over life) videos of among us?
I couldn't even understand the sheep guy lol

I did an Irish play called The Shape Of The Grave (great show) in high school and we used this exact How To Talk In An Irish Accent Video. Imagine a group of 30 Mainers sitting in a room overexaggeraging an Irish accent
Whilst us English is just: wat iz that... Bit scheeeewwwpid init'
Irish People speaking Irish: *noise*  Me: Gesundheit!
You kinda sounding like Gru from Despicable Me movie
Vowel bender sent me lmao
Jez this reminded me of when I was recording a danganronpa let’s play with some friends and I was voicing a girl(which I am not) so I ask my friends to name a voice or accent and on ego them said Irish jokingly but I literally turned the character into a leprechaun for the rest of the game and I have no regrets
Aa the lepricon on acid one :D
Brad pitts is a traveller accent which is fairly accurate. It's different to any other Irish accents
is that makeup on ur eyes?
I havent watched the video and im already thinking the accents sound like Kaisnjk jaanqkjjkhahbjabaaoikhaj a sso huhso hubis
YOUR accent is the greatest one.
After watching this video I can feel what people do when complaining about Chileans talking so fast and with a lot of slang. Im so sorry yall lmao.
Make a video critiquing Irish accents—
Omg gaelforce audios. Check out that channel!!!
So, I actually know the vocal coach for Brad Pitt from Snatch, have trained with him a few times and watched him take a grading for his 4th Dan I believe it was, and the accent isn't mean to be just a plain Irish accent its a "traveller" accent that has a base in Irish, think it was a Belfast area base.
I thought I knew english
“For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but in order that the world might be saved through him. Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only Son of God. And this is the judgment: the light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the light because their works were evil.” John 3:16-19  Again Jesus spoke to them, saying, “I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will not walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.” John 8:12
there was news in my country in iran that guy needed to pay the bank so he literlly bring an cow he owned and bringed it to the bank
Root Beer
🤣 my gosh I am Irish & I STRUGGLED with the Kerry farmers. But the frostbite boy i can remember on the news a couple of years ago.
I loved this video!
I have never been to Ireland, and my immediate family are not from Ireland. I was born in Plymouth, and was raised in Cornwall. O'Shannon isn't my original last name, I changed it when I started transitioning, and I picked it because it is the original form of my family name (Cannon), and it went better with what I chose as a first name. My first name was originally "Tristan", which for those who know Cornish/Irish folklore, the reason for my choice of first name should be obvious.  I was going to use the spelling "Iseult" but felt that people would struggle with that, so went for the spelling "Isolde" which people still have difficulty with.  I never ended up with a Westcountry accent, unlike the rest of my family, it has always been rather neutral. I can't even fake the accent from where I grew up. Funny thing is though, whenever I have had a few drinks, my accent has always changed to "some sort of Irish", not put on, I just fall into it. After watching this, I was curious what some of the other regional accents sound like, so looked at a few other videos.  The accent I seem to drop into sounds very much like County Clare.  I have always found it strange that my accent changes like that, when I have never been exposed to it.
5:07 Me when i wake up in the morning talking to my sibling
I don't know who you are, but this video was hilarious
Northern Irishman here! I love the guide to the Irish Accent video you played last, Jack! I always recommend people to watch that to understand just how many dialects Ireland has XD
19:14 as a cork man I can say That accent was pretty on point
Literally everyone complains of "half the viewers", I'm beginning to think nobody has 90% subscribed.
This was an amazing vid it brightened my day very much 😅❤️
9:15 feels like sweedish people trying out english and idk why.
Italian and french accents disgust me lol cuz if u combin italian accent with certain voices its just hilarious
I feel so uncultured now, me with my southern accent, although I try to not have too much of one, and I can’t even understand most of these people ;-;
Why didn't you let the video play with the north of Ireland, sure the Belfast accent is mad to listen to and I love it
this is what it sounds like for me: ihgurfihdigifhunihdi
Ah sean is homesick god bless him
But, I understood the guy form hot Fuzz because he was a northerner, like me
Jack: Get f@cked Italy  Marzia: me and my creations will come to your house and destroy you
Lol the actual Irish guy BANGED the cork accent reminds me of priimary
alternate title: Irish man watches videos of others with the same accent, starts to regain his accent.
Brad Pitt wasn’t necessarily Irish in snatch. He was a Gypsy.
who’s here after he changed the title
10:11 he’s like u really are a dumb dumb
I have NO idea why but for some reason Sean being able to translate felt like watching magic. Which is weird cuz I speak French and translating is really not that magical but this is different somehow lol.
Jacksepticeye literally sound like his from County Cork
10:30 holy sh!t that a lot of people if anybody is watching dream they know that he has like a 20% subscribed and 80% not subscribed rate and he has over 50% subscribed  ooooooooOOOoFoOOoOfOOFfofFffFffff
I am Irish/USA and I wish I had an Irish ascent
As a Kerry man that accent is genuinely every farmer round here and tipp
I am drinking milk 0:35 😂
Jack: insults someone also jack: laughing at his insult
I don't know where it was voted sexiest, but somewhere new Zealand was too
I had a smile on my face this entire video. Really is a SEXY accent.
I wouldn't mind a more heavier irish accent from you tbh. I understood much of the news reports just fine.
if i squint hard enough, the cork accent sounds like a horribly overdone norwegian accent
Jack: Is amused that he is good at Irish accent.  Bro. U already Irish.
Try doing a heavy southern Maine accent, I don't have a problem understanding this.
Do you know what I’ll take 3rd happy with that thought we’d be like 10th at best 🤣🤣🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
Sèan: "I want to see how many of you can understand what he is saying." Me: Being an estonian and not undersatnding even what Sèan says half the time cause i normally speak estonian.
Jack: Feels bad when they don't cast Irish people in Irish movies. South Africans when they make 100s of movies about us and never cast local actors: First Time?
i feel like yours is good but ive gotten so used to your voice
I totally understood the rowers :D  Come do the deep south and try to understand creole, superheavy.
This video made me laugh so hard my sides hurt! Some of them were the equivalent of Irish accents on steroids!
I think when people think of the Irish accents that are sexy, they think of Colin Farrell's.
I had to turn on captions and not even google cant handle the accent
''frostbit''

How is this #37 on trending?
"mirror" with the 15 R's, I cackled. I went to Disneyland with some American and English friends and they kept getting me to say "Tower of Terror" because of my accent. It was coming out as Towrr o' Terrrrrrr and I could only say it differently if I put on one of their accents.
That farmers accent is so heavy I thought he was straight speaking Gaelic 😂
Watch "irish people try" on the 'try' channell youll love it
What the fuck, Jeff?

Northern Irish accents are very thicc up around Belfast, I wonder if Sean has spent any time near Belfast
Jack little nightmares 2 just cane out!
I know ye won’t see this Seán but please react to the guide to Ireland series from Sgt Ducky, they’re bleedin brilliant
I can’t believe that we got 5th sexiest accent, good on ya Aussie
You should do a voices video your walken was on point
Jack trying to sound like irish from people trying to sound irish makes him sound like Arnold Shwatzenegger
Probably the weirdest thought ever but has anyone ever thought about being Sean’s child, anyone? No? Ok.
Yes the only reason I subscribed to Jack is for his  Accent lol love you Jack
Fucking brilliant Jack keep up the great work from Northern Ireland
The worst is whenever someone tries to do an Irish accent and does a Scottish accent instead
The shine on the board is flexing its arm
cringe
This might be irrelevant but does anyone know if jack voiced that one creepy guy that keeps popping up from trash cans in river city girls?
I’ve grown up around like really strong Irish accents down in Kerry and I don’t have a fucking clue what that man was saying
I have an Irish person living down the road from me n she is amazing

Brad Pitt sounds more like he's drunk on St. Patty's day than actual Irish.

Newfoundland and Labrador accents it’s described as sticking peanut butter to the top of your mouth with a spoon and trying to talk

26+6=1 Eirin go bragh
So where's Shaun's accent from??
and another thing scottish accents are one of the hardest to understand and the funny thing is you cant whisper a scottish accent your still whisper yelling
I have an Irish family and they are either so fucking loud when they talk or they are whispering it's so funny
He should play Little nightmares 2 when it comes out, or maybe it came out already I can’t remember. But he should play it when it does.
The Irish accent is just English but you can’t understand it

And people taking the piss out of it is just annoying as hell
I love this so much holy shit
Mirrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
I haven’t adopted an accent but I’ve noticed since watching Jack’s videos, I’ve been pronouncing my ARs more Irishly
the Irish accent is very loose but pronounced
The accent in snatch is supposed to be not quite Irish.
Jack! Play Huniepop 2
Me who was forced to learn an Irish accent for a bunch of white peoples entertainment, watching this video, thinking I’m doing well, comes across a how to do video, I’m fine so far, it’s the one I used to learn the accent, 😐
Idk... us Puerto Ricans have some sexy ass accents 🤩🥵
can't believe he didn't catch the rubber bandits reference for the limerick accent with the spar bag on the head
Jack is basically bilingual
Sean you should do a house tour
Could you please do a tutorial on Irish accent? This is not a hate comment, I just want to learn Irish accent really bad for DnD and all those tutorial videos arent much of a help. And I would rlly like to watch that :D
the farmer sounds like a sim lol
This is as confusing as Russian cursives
I love how we can actually understand jack, but when he starts swearing, he’s speaking fecking alien talk
Seán William Mduduusjjsnwnebwo
A Corkonian friend of mine greets everyone with "top of the morning" constantly. We tried to reason with him, but alas.
🤣🤣🤣 I enjoyed every minute of this.
Frost Butt
okay IF there's gonna be a part 2 I really just wanna know what he thinks about Pablo Schreibers accent in American Gods because idk if it's actually really good or if they tricked me into thinking it's good
I can sorta do it
How it sounds: "Mac An Tee-hee" How it's spelled "Mac An *TITSHIGH"*
I’m surprised I could understand the rowers 😂
If you stick an Irishman in the sun to long he starts sounding Aussie.
5:17  ''Ģe Si'' Lmao
As someone taking linguistics rn, the video on how to make the accent at 11 minutes was.... painful. I can't help but cringe because a vocal coach (singing) is so different from a dialect coach (linguistics major)
@10:50 omg i'm dying 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Guys he forgot who the rubberbandits were  a sad day for the parish 🇮🇪
Guys he forgot who the rubberbandits were  a sad day for the parish 🇮🇪
tbh one of the only reasons I'm still on the fence about moving to Ireland when I start college (aside from being a million miles away from everyone I've ever known) is that I have issues understanding what people are saying normally- but add on a thick irish accent? I'd be getting on everyones nerves asking them to repeat themselves 8 hundred times
0:42 I was pouring milk into my cereal
Ah this is like Call Me Kevin's video reacting to Irish News, glad to see more Irish people commenting on the sheep in Kerry
Pleaseeeeee come to donegal !!!!!
Omg who painted the fuckin sheep smh
I love this
im american but i can do a perfect scottish accent i sometimes have to clarify to people out in public that im american not scottish
The Irish farmers sound like they are speaking in reverse
At least we can understand Jack. Except when hes around other Irish people. Then all hell breaks loose
Does anyone know the name of the background music in the video?
What's the name of your background music every time you talk?
tbf the woman doing the lesson ended up sounding like my family in Derry lmao
what about northern Irish people
FARTY-five sheep, one may say that's a lot, or one may say it's hardly a breeze.
that mad accent sounds like danish
Making fun of each other is a sign of love in most places. But, ya know, America has to be different.
That kid like stuck his whole ass face in the flower lmaooo
I feel like you kinda have to be Irish to properly understand the accents like, and yeah, you really can't generalise an accent as "Irish" because there are just so many like...
Love the Irish accent. But then my family is from Cill Mhant`ain... Wicklow for those that didn't get that.  My mum  was taught to drop the accent at school. Sad really. Some people look at me and ask what is that accent..I don't even notice. So yes irish accent is sexy
6:19 Sounds like my Dutch grandmother when she thinks she’s speaking english
Seán looking like Tom Holland, mixing accent lol
2:23 why do you sound like Gru from despicable me 😂😂
please do a watch of a pro irish guy do accents
I can understand the Cork accent much better than the Kerry one. Then again I have had a holiday in Bandon and I loved it.
I bit
Why you dont play warzone
irish people: yeah let's just speak in tongues and see if people can understand
Alternative title: Irish man insulting non Irish people trying to do Irish accents and simping over heavy Irish accents.
i feel like people from ierland and people from wisconsin were built from the same factory XD
okay but that trailer deadass looks and sounds like 90s movie trailers like the goose movie uhhh Fly Away Home??? like that
Literally to the 1% who'd reading this, God bless you, stay safe and have a wonderful year.....
Oh my gosh the translating had me dead 🤣🤣🤣
Im 1/2 Irish but bbybi couldn't make out a WORD the first one was saying
I feel your pain.... Braveheart -_-
It has been exactly 6 years since Sean beat Hard Time. I really miss that series
Could you watch "young offenders" best moments, the irish bbc comedy series. It would be fucking brilliant 🤣🤣
No no. Welsh is the bigfoot in pur world
Reminds me of a vid I've seen about Danish people not understanding their own language.
You thought the impression of Irish accent in the movies was bad? Consider yerself lucky! Just look at how they usually depict Russians :)
Irish accents are just magical
Man, who made this list? Like, have you ever heard brazilian portuguese??
They officially did hear the French accent yet 😉 haha
m
30 seconds in and I gotta call you out on your shit Jack. It was actually the New Zealand accent that was voted sexiest in the world. Do your research next time you absolute pleabian.
I know that the American accent is dead last on the most sexy accents
pcrow's voice: ONLY A (small) PERCENTAGE OF VIEWERS ARE SUB--
Omg. My sister and I visited Ireland last summer. We had no problem in Dublin but when we traveled out of it we were very much like “😀???????? (what’d he say??)”
I’m glad that Jack didn’t say anything about the Australian accent, that’s one of the reasons why I’m subscribed to this man.
My name is corbin and its irish for god of ravens
I'm still shocked that Sean could 100% understand those farmers     w(°ｏ°)w
I HAVE MET THAT FROSTBIT BOY! He’s Northern Ireland’s legend
Like in Dublin there is a huge difference between north and south accents
17:03 "I don't have 4 leaves, but if you ???? I can give you luck." Did she say paint for the ??? part? I dunno what she said. :c help
Try an Australian accent
I swearrrrrr you've done this video before... either that or it was callmekevin.
WE WANT MORE IRISH CULTURE!
jack: go to bed child drink some milk bitch dani: am offended
i can understand most of this cause I'm from northern Ireland but there is some parts I'm sat here like wtf
5:30 just sounds like if you combine swedish and japanese
Yes !!!   Irish and Patois ❤️ Belong together lol 😂
I’ve a thick Tyrone accent... it’s messy lmao
Noooo, react to the full video! That was great at the end!
Oi this video pre'ey schtewpid innit
I don't why but I really loved that kind of video and I laughed so hard, and PLEASE! do other accents maybe
He should have watched Boondock Saints. It's just Daryl Dixon becoming less Irish throughout the whole film. AND THERE'S 2 FILMS!!
Can we all agree that Jack's accent is the best one? Or is it just me?
you should Look at Strong Newfoundland Accents, They're Pretty much the Irish of Canada
How not the Aussie accent sorry it’s just my opinion
I am Irish
I remember rowing for a race there in cork Man it's been nearly two years now🙃
“Sad mazia noice”
me, an emily blunt stan watching this video: 😳
Jack's accent has definitely slowly changed over the years. Don't know how to explain it, it's like slightly americanised now or has a bit of English sauce
even the subtitles are struggling
i wasn't calling your mum a tart
Just letting you know - you are completely understandable. When my English wasn't so good, I could understand you waaaay easier than many English people for example
I only gave this vid a like because jack said that Brat pit was gorgeous
The only word i heard was sheep and not that difficult
I didnt understand a thing in this video. But im happy
The only Irish man I saw in the wild mountain thyme trailer was Jamie Dornan. For anyone living under a rock the past few years, he played Christian Grey in 50 Shades of Grey
This is why i dont want to go to Ireland because i would ask people if they could repeat that a thousand times and i think everyone would juss get pissed if im tryna talk to em
Dublin accent is the best Irish accent
Wait,  does Sean not know about The Rubberbandits?
Looks like another episode of LOVE/HATE
So, Philippines no longer have the sexiest voice in the world....
Think they are confused with British, Scottish and Irish. Lol
I thought the Jacksepticeye impression was scream everything you say
The third one sounded like a Liverpool, welsh and Scottish accent in 1 😂😂😂
OILLAND OILLAND nailed it.
5:00 I have a lot of Irish friends(my grandma and dad are also Irish) and even I cat understand it is he even speaking english
I understand your pain. Every time some of my English friends tell me: “they go to the Netherlands in this movie”, I brace myself for the horrible fake Dutch accents I’m about to hear (just to name an example: the new Spider-Man movie, when he ends up in Broek op Langedijk)
Jacks Christopher walken impression sounded like Arnold swartanagger 😂😂  EDIT: I know that’s not how you spell swartzanagger
Mirr' 🤣🤣🤣🤣 it's funny cause it's true!
this video challenges my English vocabulary
I feel like some of these are like the Irish equivalent of the hood people in the movie airplane and Sean is the old lady...
Random joe: can you say top of the mornin  Irish woman: no     Irish to jack: THIS IS YOUR FAULT SEÁN!!!
Hi jacksepticeye, can you pls react to my 1 second video on my channel in a video.
Australian accents is also a big weird thing in the whole accent world. We don’t even sound that much different
Every other country: WERE IN CHAOS SOMEONES DOIN DRUGS AND TERRORIST ATTACKS ARE EVERYWHERE  ireland: sooo uuuuuhh we have someone who lost 45 sheep in our country
I love all Celts and this is just me getting into the spirit of things. Aah to be sure Sean t'was a fahntastic filum!
At least us Aussies are 5th in the world of the most Sexy voices.                                                                                                  Right?
I'm listening to these movie accents like, "Lolwut"????  😂😂😂🤣🤣💀
0:23 Get fuck lonely
21:12 - ironically, not a bad impression of Christopher Walken.
After restrictions are eased would you ever consider doing an ireland road trip? Take along one or two youtubers you're close with. Would be fun to watch.
11:43 M, I, and then 15 Rs. ~Sean Mcloosken, 2020
"Oi mate, stay away from me missus or I'll knock your block off" definitely screams 5th place for the most sexist accent.   Stay classy Australia
Not going to lie but the thickest accent i have ever heard was when I was down in Louisiana. I was down there visiting family and there was this one kid who kept trying to talk to me and I could only understand every 4th word. And that was with him using is hands to describe what he was saying. I tried to talk to some of my family who lives down there and get them to translate. Even they couldn't understand. I have a northern American accent so I know I must have sounded weird to that kid but I thought it was funny to try and talk to the kid and see what I could understand.
Yes we irish are built different
jack: translating   me: am i the only one who knows what there saying
I only know one Irish word. And it is.. 🥔
That is not English 💀💀
As someone who has lived around southern people in the US, I have no problem understanding Irish accents.  If you think that shepherd was bad you should hear some country folk from West Virginia, you would swear they need subtitles.  O-O
Sheep mans accent i understood like barley anything  Ahh of course the music of the irish accent.... jibberish  to only light accent
Must be the Irish in me but I could understand the Cork boys perfectly. And can anyone tell me why Irish lads are so damn beautiful?
A graaaaaaate buncha lads
Thanks jack. This will help me when I visit Ireland to search for my family. I still won’t know what anyone is saying but I can show them this video
Jack do you know that ireland has won the most  in eurovision competition
Its isnt bad its just irish
So used to the Cork accent that I barely even notice what's wrong 😂
My only question: *‘Why are the sheeps pink snd blue??’*
1:11 what is this? the discovery channel?
Day 1 of asking for maneater part 6 lol
and we didn't get any accents from connacht, shame
wait my accent is the 5th most sexiest in the world?? eehhh still didnt raise my self esteem
I’m Irish honestly I can just understand them the sheep dude though. Bruh I’m also from laios and my grandparents sound like they’re from cork but they’re from roscommon
It took me a while to realize that the farmer was speaking English. I thought the clip was about the reporter.
5:32 man straight us sounds like he’s speaking Welsh and as a welsh man myself: trust me I’d know.
I watch videos like this to prepare to meet my uncle from Kerry, and his accent isn’t even as hard to understand as some of these wow
𝑰𝑹𝑰𝑺𝑯 𝑰𝑺 𝑰𝑹𝑺𝑰𝑯
It’s so funny. When my dad goes home he comes back and I even struggle to understand him 😂 I’ve always loved the way he says mirror and wine - especially when he teases us aussies for how we say itz
there was sssffffffateyy foive shieep missn 6:17
What happened to and I will see all of you dudes in the next video and Sam at the end
Haha wow😂 Jack always funny 😂
this reminds me of when i got to my grandparents house (deep south) and they say I  sound Canadian because I'm from Washington. ya know with our lags baygs and ehgys (legs, bags, and eggs
the olympic rower wearing the black shirt sounds like a Swedish person with a strong accent trying to do an Irish accent
jack please watch more scary things
Next up: React to Dutch Dialects with Gab!!!
Jack: i like the Scenery   Me i like the mf POTATOES
I spend three months in Belfast and it took me fucking a month before I got what anyone was saying there lol!
I’ve understood people mumbling, i’ve understood every word my parents whispered downstairs when i was a child, but i cannot figure out what that irish man is saying.
I am Irish, and I do not understand that farmer
I am ethnically Irish but i am a southern american from the great state of Mississippi... However im also autistic and i had a terrible speech impediment when i was young and learnex to speak clearly by organically switching accents as i speak... I am now 29 and my most common default accent is a monotone irish accent that me grandmother speaks in. Not very stereotypical so folk around me thinks I am speaking in some strange english accent so i got that going for me. Ha!.
More of this jack
The first interviewee one be like: is that even english?
Jack should react to US accents. The one I always make fun of is New Jersey.  Some people question me on stuff I say being from the east coast but currently living in the midwest. Thumbs up if you understand "Ill as a hornet"
This was so much fun to watch.. Its only when I see our accents beside an American that I realise how strong our accent are
I'm partial to the County Wicklow accent.
If y'all want more Irish content, would recommend 'The TRY Channel'.
I’m not even Irish and I was cringing 😂
I’m actually drinking milk right now and feel asaulted as fuck
As an Australian, I want to vOMIT when people attempt an Australian accent. I feel ur pain Jack
why does he look like the bad guy from watch dogs 2
Thank you for translating that farmer, Sean. I remember seeing the video years ago and he has haunted my dreams ever since.  I literally can understand most Irish, but that farmer was beyond my comprehension.
Me, a Brit with welsh cousins and a Scottish friend who lives in Canada: bitch please
petition to have a watch party of the brad pitt film with the irish lads!
It should be voted to be the funniest     accent in the worl (not hater) pls
That mountain man is speaking native language
Its like comparing Kentucky accent to Alabama accent. 😆 🤣
Idk how but YouTube’s subtitles can understand yet when I speak it sounds like him
How is the Australian accent number 5. Have they even heard bogans, they sound discusting.
WELL, how many times did Jack butchered French accent, tearing my French ears apart? I consider his complains about that "Irish" movie inacceptable :(
... I wasn’t going to say it, but yeah you’re definitely the reason American’s ask us to say top of de mournin to yeh
Pit sounds drunk irish
Seán you're a beautiful human being. And I don't understand a word you saying.
this video isn't about a movie. he's just still hung up on Ethan calling him a son of a trucks mother   Edit: 76 likes?! this is my first time getting over around 10 likes on a comment!!! THANK U SO MUCH I LOVE EVERYONE WHO REPLIED, THANK UUUUU!! AM I FAMOUS NOW? can I get a gold play button for this, I'm so happy, was a reference all I needed to do? holy dang, ty :D
Jack can’t use a heavy accent or the video would become age restricted. After all, Irish accents are the sexiest accents.
It’s my favorite accent.
All I learnt for an Irish accent is hold your ‘R’ and ‘L’ legit hahhhah
Im from newfoundland, and i also say alot of things that sound irish, because pretty much all of newfoundlands ancestors are irish, but he used mirror and he said "mirrrrr" and i say it like it to
I *LOVE*... ... Me lucky *CHARMS* ... ... They're *MAGICALLY*... ... ... De*LICIOUS!*
This was great fun! ^_^
They updated subnatica
Norway also have an insane amount of accents.
French a sexy accent !!!!!! This is the most ugly accent in the world or maximum it's a funny accent not SEXY
Im starting to think Jack watches Mrs Brown's Boys.
I didn't know Spar was Worldwide
I enjoyed this video very much.
As an Aussie... I felt this
At least the number of people subbed is over half. The one supposedly from Kerry may have sounded british , I wouldn't know personally. However she was rather cute.
Having Irish family you learn to understand certain things, but some parts of the country I just nod and smile.
Jack your accent is a mix between multiple thing like American English and Irish it get stronger from the different ppl your hangout with
the brad pitt one i can’t 😭😭
Shouldve listened to Sean Connerys "irish" accent in the untouchables. I dont think youd even know it was supposed to be irish lmao
If you want to speak with an irish accent, all you need to do is say the words ‘whale oil beef hooked’ 🤣
It’s more than just an accent
Jack do you not know Blindboy?
OMG guy's i just realized 30 years from now Jack will be 60.
This seems fitting 🤣🤣
As a person applying for Irish universities I'm kind of afraid I'm going to end up speaking like that lol
" i was there for her, and her kiss... Mmm... *BREAD AND BUTTER* "  ~Ytp harry osborne
jack.... please tell me you got the rubberbandits reference
German: *is not in the sexiest accents* *Cries in German*
There is no pause, commas and full stop in Ireland.
That farmer is impossible to understand for me. Holy shit dude. I'm honestly surprised Sean can.
THAT VIDEO WITH "MAD ACCENT" IM NOT NATIVE ENGLISH SPEAKER SO I LEGIT THOUGHT IT WAS SOMETHING LIKE FAKE AUDIO WITH SIMLISH REPLACING ACTUAL AUDIO WTF
God I watched snatch for the first time the other day! Bruh
"The iresh ackcent"
please more of this
Man I remember a few years ago a bloke from Ireland came to Queensland Australia for work, guy was from cork.. none of us could understand a word that he said but we knew his name was Seamus (pronounced shay-mus) but we don't have that name here so he became jaymes then later Jimmy, then we gave up on that on just called him Irish..  (just roll with it we're Aussies alright..) poor bloke used to drink like a fish at the bar and try pick up the girls, but no one could understand anything, so I had to laugh at this thanks Jack please do more of these if you can :)
Never let a non-irish person teach you an Irish accent
Its 3:am for me right now
My bus driver in 2018 was Irish
I could understand most of them. The Sheep famer was a bit harder to understand but I could understand portions of what he said.  But then again I have family in Ireland on my dad's side of the family so a bit of ancestry there, and I'm also from Michigan which has a bit of a fast speaking accent it's self so that might be why too. (Well that and apparently over 10% of  Michigan's population is Irish or of Irish decent so.. 😅 We hold Irish music festivals and such here too.)  Also in general checking out other accents, even if it's your own, is always fun and interesting. 😄
I love how CallMeKevin watched that Irish farmer from Kerry and struggled to understand him and now Jack is going,"yeah, I think some Irish people would struggle to understand him." Pure gold  Editing to add: Listening to Jack cringe at Americans doing bad Irish accents is like everytime he (or anyone for that matter) does a North American Southern accent for me. It's kind of painful and you're wondering who the hell they've heard south of the Mason dixon line speak like that.
I love these types of videos. We miss you in Ireland Seán 💜
I'm Irish and I can't understand him.
Italian is second?! I didn’t know lmao, that’s why people love us! (That and the food i guess).
when you get to irish
can some one please get me a console
Dis made me miss Ireland!!
Lol
Reminds me of our vacation in Ireland years ago. Asked the bus driver if it was the correct bus to our airport. He talked a lot, but at the end I just looked at my friend "did you understand what he said?" and she said "no.." and then we just got into the bus and hoped we were correct. Irish accents are tough :D
It ended so soon I wanted more lol 😂
2:21 his voice reminds me of the dude off of despicable me... i forgot his name...   edit: oh- his name is gru... my bad
12:42 we can see how Mark's company has affected our Boi 😂
Hey Jack how about Claymore County?

-____-
Oil
Hey, that's not that hard to understand XD (except some words that are just new to me)
Dude, what about the Boondock Saints?
Imma guess...jacks from cork?
He made fun of the three runner ups, but stopped before Australia,  as he himself finds Australians sexy
In snatch, they had brad Pitt do his “own accent” because he couldn’t do a good Irish one and they even have subtitles just for Mickey (his character) because you can’t understand him very well.
Imagine hiring Christopher Walken for a role and not using his iconic voice...
Its funny how no one can understand the sheep farmer while for me its a normal accent I hear daily
I like how he didn't dis Australia
Jack should make this a series about all of the accents in the world
Why do jacks eyes look like naruto in Sage mode? 11:38
10:10
I understood the accent clearly
At some point it sounded like im hearing chinese rather than english
I'm kinda curious about the difference of accents between Scottish and Irish. Because to me, when their accent is really strong, I can't tell any strong difference between those two accents. Or I just confused Scottish accent with Gaelic. Can someone please help me with this?
So why wasn’t this a LAUGH?
I forgot about frostbit 😂😂 🇮🇪❤️
every time jack tells us to like the video... but i always like before i’ve even watched it...
6:47 "fortnite"
10:16    The way he just has to pause the video and say "music you call it" and then just the small little mumble of "music" has got to be my favorite part. Just the pure look of "well this is gonna be fun isn't it."
I can kinda understand the mad farmer
1:28  JoJo’s _______ adventure
0:26 so close to absolutely killing me for only being 5th
Can you do some more Among us with pewds
Now i kinda get it why irish accent is very hard, their mouth movement is very minimal and you really have to know their slangs i think
God the farmer at times sounds like he's talking Japanese or something
Ok, so I'm Irish but I was born and raised in America, and I understood all of what they were saying...like how?! Please explain
the show young offenders. they have a good Irish accent
38 on trending right now
In that sheep clip, I swear that one guy with the heavy accent literally sounded Chinese when I wasn't devoting all my attention to the video
I’m Irish, people are always telling me I have a bit Irish accent, now I see this I don’t know what they’re talking about
You have to listen and try to translate the interview they had with this old Irish guy in a pub. I may have understood 3 or 4 words out of the whole interview
Jack should look at the Tom Cruise movie where he was in Ireland
Is it just me or does Christopher Walken sound like Gru from despicable me
Farmer be like mahsnwjanduenwei
holy shit jack has an incredible skill to translate what sounds like gibberish  xD
"FrostButt"
Jack: whenever someone asks me to say top of the morning I just cringe also jack: *is wearing his top of the morning merch*
Seán: "Also, I notice that whenever I do this kind of video my accent gets much stronger"   Me, a non-native: "Wait, which accent? I don't hear any accent!" O.o
To Brad Pitt's credit, the accent in the movie was ridiculous and hard to understand on purpose.
LOL dude  Australian accent was the fifth or sixth one on that chart  IF YOUVE BEEN TO STRAYA YOU KNOW A L L T O O W E L L WHAT WE SOUND LIKE 😂
C'mon, after Harry Potter and Star Wars, Domnhall Gleeson's just asking to be in a film about Irish people... that isn't Brooklyn
Could anyone else understand the second Sheep Farmer better than the first one?
ig irish is more of the language of love than even french lol
Play robot 64 on roblox!
I'm impressed I understand half of it not even being a native English person
I start caring about irish accents because Pokémon sword and shield fan make a meme about the female protagonist being Irish, and now look where I am swimming in this internet...   Gosh Irish accent are SO SEXY!
I've always been jealous of people who are proud of where they're from. I'm from somewhere voted one of the worst English accents and I hate the accent so much I tried changing it years ago. Stuck with a hybrid accent now lol
Aww brad pitt, you’re lucky you’re *_gorgeous_*
I don't bother trying an Irish accent because everytime I try it sounds Scottish
“It’s not Irish, it’s not English, it’s just.. well it’s just pikey”
The only place in the world more accent *dense* than Ireland is _Sweden._  We can barely understand the county _next_ to us, never mind the *other side of the country!*
It's all different but also the same
How the fuck can I understand the sheep guy? I'm from Norway, I shouldn't be good at english accents.
Im proud I understood most of it
Jack play the undertale swich virsion (1 new boss) jack play it
The farmer could out rap eminem
how about teaching evelyne the irish accent:D
I am surprised you are able to understand the farmer. Because when I watched Kevin's video he was genuenly lost. And we all know he's 100% irish.
Italy Scotland and France: you gotta do me like that :(
SEAN! YOU SKIPPED THE BEST PART OF BRAD PITT’S ACCENT. IT’S THE DAGS! FUCHS WOULD I WANT A CARAVAN FOR IT’S GOT NO FUCKING WHEELS!!
Irish is the language with no periods
I have an Estuary English accent closer to cockney, I've heard so many actors in films try and do it when it's not their accent, Jesus it's hilarious!
11:00, dont worry Jack, she's just saying "i'll", we do not say oil for I and do not say oiland
Brad Pitt was doing gypsy Irish not Irish Irish
There has never been an Irish accent I can't understand because there's like 6 different ones in my class and 4 come from the town I live in, it isn't even a big town
Why do i feel like im in the airplane when the farmer guy talks 😂😐
I feel like Jack is Hector from BL2 translating for papa hodunk here
Aren't this just discussing dialects? I thouch accent are when english is your second language and your first language accent the english, so I speak with a norvegian accen in english, but I speak with a norvegian dialect in norwegian
of course that rower from cork could pass for Kevin's brother because Kevin's 100% irish...
SUBTITLES! XD The English Subtitles on this are absolutely hilarious!!
Stopping before Northern Ireland comes up in the video like sir
0-0 I just realized if I name my kid seán,  he would be a mix of jack and pewds (Seán Felix)  so uh yeah I'm doing that
I like how he posts a vid like this every two years to remind us that he's Irish.
Apparently, I have a castle named after me there... I'm guessing all I have to do is show up and they'll give it to me for the asking. Only problem is, that I don't speak the language ;-)
Jack I beg u     Please make an intro with u speaking Irish please
irish roars is what i heard
You should get all your Irish friends and react to more videos like these with all of them!!
Connor McGregor........
I'm American. Lived in Denmark for a couple years. Absolutely loved it but home is home, and when you're not home... well you're probably... probably quite possibly... not home? Kind of funny though because now I'm home and I want to move.... WHAT DOES THIS MEAN! One thing's for sure though, no matter where I go. I always end up coming home... because that's where I live.
My father and gran...had an Irish accent but I've never heard it outside the family...they come from the Dublin area, but it doesn't sound like that...and so much fasssster.
I kinda disagree jack. Irish accent is not the sexiest accent in the world. Corpse accent is the sexiest and that's it periodt
Irish when they mad they become germans
"I'm a vowel bender". Love this
Thanks for posting this on my birthday 😂
I'm Scottish and I'm pretty sure the folk song "wild mountain thyme" is actually originally a Scottish song too!😂
like a homegrown cork langer, boii especially after i had a Jumbo-breakfast-roll
Her saying it: Park Me:... pYark
This video really is just that scene from Hot Fuzz
watch at 2x speed
Love your accent! Adore all the United Kingdoms accents.  What is your opinion of the Aussie accent? It is also one that Hollywood NEVER gets right. They usually sound either British or South African (sometimes a bastard child of the 2). As you suggested with the Irish accent, they should ONLY cast Aussies for an Aussie part.
As an Australian I can relate to having an accent I don’t believe is as strong as my foreign friends believe. One in particular says I’m the most Australian person she’s ever heard but I have a standard accent, no bogan by any means 😅
8:00
Am I the only one who could understand them except for the farmer dude?😂
Dat wuz grat meh bah, mooch luvter yah.
Oh holy moley. If I cross my ears and cross my eyes, I can sorta make out what the sheep farmers are saying. XD
Jack like making fun of people for faking accents  Jack: used to hide his accent
Brad Pitt's Irish traveller accent was not all that bad.
Irish man nails Christopher walken impression while Christopher walken ruins Irish accent
How is the Australian accent ranked 5th? Have they... have they seen Australians?
Jack talking about Ireland always makes me happy
I took one of those ancestry DNA test things . . . There's a bit o' Irish in me!
Evelyn hit 500K subs , I think it's for a good ol'collab.
I think the no.7 was supposed to be no.1
sean, an irish man can understand a irishman with a heafty accent, me as a bristolian can understand and translate a fucker in a hot fuz who speaks compleat jibberish
Pretty sure my brain short circuited trying to understand the really thick accents.😂
The one with Christopher Walken was pretty bad but If you want to see a real SH%T show you should take a look at a movie called Far and Away.
What? No shriek?! 🤣🤣🤣😂 don’t shank me
Not 2 mention the clothes they were wearing lol in ireland ppl just wear o neills tracksuits and gaa jeresys lol
Sean your making me wish I was born in Ireland
sean...   are you wearing makeup on yer eyes?  they're so orange on the sides :0
You look so diffrent from 2012 you
I love me a good Irish translator 😍😂👏🏽
"Go back to bed child!" new insult
the subtitles tho
😂😂😂 your videos never fail to make me laugh, sometimes I get in trouble for staying up and watching your videos-....because of my damn laugh
I want to see you attempt a southern American accent 😂
I swear the last time I saw a jse video he had like 12mil at most...
Brad Pitt's accent is good there but his acting isn't. Like he doesn't have the rhythm of the lines down at all but he dies have the accent right. Probably too focused on one over the other
That was amazing and I want more
i am arabic proof? salam alykum keaf halak allah yawfqak fel youtube try to read that as a challenge.
Would also love to see a video about Irish (Gaeilge) :P I study Celtic languages and culture at uni and it makes me sad to see these beautiful languages dying out (can't speak any of them myself though :'D )
I know I as an American, have been watching way too much Irish people on YouTube when everyone's hard to understand Irish accents on this video aren't that difficult to understand.
I dont think english accents are really a thing either because theres loads of accents just like in ireland. im from the north of England and no one here sounds anything like english people in the media.
We have accents here in America near impossible to understand...namely the Deep Appalachian (True Hill Billy) accent. I speak with an  American Standard Accent...but Deep Appalachian has to be the HARDEST American accent to understand.
Snatch is still a good film
Irish man compliments himself at doing an Irish accent. 😆😆😆 Some of the best videos are unplanned, 👌 (like this one)
SÉAN. READ THIS.   You need to surround yourself with and embrace your Irish Culture - Just the way you keep telling ppl to laugh and be happy : When you get involved with anything Irish you are much more natural, confident and funny. Seriously seriously funny.  And the difference is so noticeable compared to most other video that has nothing Irish in it.  Because it is likewise noticeable tha you are adherring to a american or global crowd and it seems like you are trying to change or adapt yourself too strongly and thus deferring from your natural confidence and funniness.  You Love Ireland! Don't  be afraid to Be it. Be yourself because it's not happy to surpress yourself.  Kind regards,  Apex   "GET FUCKED ITALY!!!!" 😂😂😂
man, ive developed a wee bit of an irish accent just watchin ya
I can't believe that you missed to show 'A Kerryman Gives Directions' by Foil Arms and Hog. It's a classic. :D
Also Frostbit lad is well famous up here lmao
Im dumb im in a apartment and i seen a spider i was looking for the poison for it and i couldn't so i used my bb gun and now the window is cricked and i missed
Actually American accents are pretty similar throughout there's a few different regions and most people living in them have very similar accents
dude play hylics  just go give it a try it a great game but i dont really know why its not so popular. theres been nothing new in 2020 like a new game fandom though but hylics is one and it looks like everyone is kind of missing off
I think the Irish accent sounds like a mix between Dutch or Flemish and English sometimes
me sees the name of the movie”wild mountain thyme” * excited scottish/irish noises *      (if you know you know)
The translation part was by God the funniest freaking thing I've seen in a long time because it was literally like "I have no clue what he said" then you translated and I was like "OOooohhh I guess it did sound somewhat like that"
Vocal couch...jack “nobody sounds like this”.....county cork....everyone sounds like that.
As a Norn Irish lass. I'm shocked I can understand the Southern accents lmao. I love the Southern Irish accent more than my own lol
I wanna listen to Irish rappers now
Can you do this for Australia
You could have translated the sheepdude saying anything, I wouldnt have known.
Me at the beginning of the video: Oh, it can't be that bad, surely I can understand something. Me after the farmers: Nvm.
I hit like for "go drink some more milk, bitch"
"I'm a vowel bender"👌❤️😂
I had to turn on youtube subtitles to understand any of this.
Search up a newfoundland accent its worse
In all honesty, each country has a their own collection of accents. In Switzerland, we have over 30 different accents so that often makes it hard to understand certain people, even for Swiss citizens. Also, I've been to Dublin and I used to despise the accent until I was there. I wouldn't call it sexy, it's rather... cute. Just so goddamn addorable. Tirtee. I died. So cute.
Not trying to be mean...but the Irish man who lost his sheep... Someone get him some dental care, that looks painful. 😫
Technically jack doesn’t have a traditional accent
The school kids accent sounds like a mix between English and German
You should also take a look at yet another Irish Sean on Red Dead 2.
Mikey (as the news guy said) : Blimeyfindmeafterthem (or whatever) Me: kinda german sounding :o
Jack doing the Irish accent tutorial: Ï'm great at this! Me: He has achieved the ultimate comedy
Him translating Irish sounds like rocket translating Groot, doesn't make fucking sense
u know there bad when he says he can't understand them
When Jack is trying to do a irish accent even tho he is irish it sounds like arnold schwarzenegger
Now funnily enough I have an Irish uncle who taught me how to read Gaelic...so it baffles Irish people when a yank comes over and can read all the signs perfectly.
I don't care if she is English or Irish.. That woman is beautiful! I HAD TO SAY IT! OK?
I don't know if you're an Irish dan or dan is an English you I mean dantdm
ayo same for sexiest accent, but in 2019   im a  Kiwi
Me looking at jack's mouth:  wow that beard
Jacks accent I cant notice it because I watched him from the start
Sean, You should watch "The wind that shakes the barley" it's actually so good
Seán, thank you so much for not disrespecting the Aussie accent at the beginning
We need Jack to meet Kathleen so he can tell her that  *"There no gays in Ireland, Kathleen!"*
I love the fact he dodges dissing Australia, so he does love us
I didn’t stop laughing the whole time dear lord 😂
Watching you have fun was the best part of this video
The irish "Mirrr" for 'mirror' isn't half as bad as the north americans who say "mee-yer". Not all of them, but enough.
Jack: “ so many Irish people watching this right now are cringing “ Me: *laughs and hide under the blanket *
this was so genuinely entertaining
Actually my friend has such a good fake Irish accent he fooled Irish people.....in Ireland.
8:34 We watched that in English class
Wow even a 100% Irish lad callmekevin couldn't understand the farmer, Sean actually understands it. Sean is more Irish than Kevin confirmed.
Snatch is one of my favourite movies of all thyme. Also hot fuzz
"keep it in the blindfold Jeff"  Me: (dead on the ground)  Seriously this video made me laugh the most I have in a while and I don't know why. Maybe it's just because I think what they said about Ireland is true. In that, depending on how far down you are, your accent gets stronger and stronger. To the point where if you're out in Kelly nobody aside from your own neighbors can understand you, but further up in the northern side, your words can actually get across to native english speakers. No offense.
0:24 who the fuck wants a bogan wispering in their ear
No fair he's been watered-down by us plebs
O dear lord i turned on my Irish accent that i developed just because i love the accent and i cant turn it off
Is it bad i could almost understand that old man
Oh my gosh Jack translating is hilarious
2:20  Is that arnold schwarzenegger??
Oi I refuse this 8:05 ain’t English fam
I spent a year living in ireland with family and... my god, my great uncle brendan. I love him to bits, but I would dread when he'd take me out places because i'd have to spend my time trying to decipher his impossible speech, and guessing wildly at when nodding and smiling is appropriate, and when he's expecting me to answer. And how am I meant to answer when I have no idea what the bloody hell it is he asked? The man has three teeth, no inflection and doesn't open his mouth when he speaks. He CLAIMS he's lived his whole life in Dublin but dear god he's the only person in the whole city who I can't understand at all.
19:20 "Everything down in C a r k is just g r e h t! Ye out an ye go ought an we dkikin de flayn n shavin jis shaev a boluk a yeoaowh!"
I love that when Sean mentions people trying to copy his accent and he mimics it, there is no change from his original 😂😂
8:16 it sounds like he said frostbutt
Look up the water boy movie assistant coach and thats cajun dialect that i can't understand
I feel proud that my Australian accent beat the sexy british one
This video was so amusing, I love when Sean just gets random and enjoys himself. Not everything has to be planned. Feels like we're just hanging out together watching videos, it's great.
My southern heritage in the US is comprised of Scottish, Irish and English, with a little French thrown in.  Some of my family’s surnames are Sturgeon, Sutherland, Smith and Russell.  I’m a Sturgeon.  My sister is a redhead and my brother has a red beard.  Also, we cut off the “ing” in word endings too.
Me: * being calm * Jack: THE IRISH ACCENT IS AN ELUSIVE THING🔊
ngl i could lowkey understand what they were saying and i have no idea how
I could almost understand the farmer, but not quite
I’m so glad my ancestors are Irish.
I thought it said “sit thigh”
I sang a song in choir class called Wild Mountain Thyme so this is gonna be torture but I'm here anyway
Sean talking about Brad Pitt: it's good you're pretty cuz you dont got much else goin for ya
I live in Spain and one of my high school teachers thinks he’s Irish and speaks with a horrible fake Irish accent. I think he’s nuts
Jack you need to watch the quiet man John Wayne it's a amazing movie
wHat the FOHK Jeff!?
At this point, I could only say they speak the accent of Gods
I watched jacksepticeye so long I can't even hear his ascent
He didnt say eat shit Australia. We're still in Aussies.
Dang. I didn’t want this to end  😂😂😂
Also I really love the Cork accent. I love all of them, though.
Momento Mori..
Jack translating that video for us makes him look like a man with godly powers
00:06 Throwing shade ad Unnus Annus?
I think that at least a third of Jack’s fans have been waiting for a video like this for years
Farty five
Doing accents is a small talent of mine, but Irish has always eluded me. I cannot for the life of me figure it out and always slip into Scottish afterwards. Props to anyone non-Irish who can do a solid accent
Bro, imagine how Americans feel when other countries represent us, heeey.. I'm walking heeeree. Were not all from Brooklyn lol. But yeah America does make a shitload of bullshit Irish movies
Whenever my dad starts talking with one of his relatives on the phone or something his accent immediately becomes 9000% stronger and refers to everything in the quantifiable universe as "yer man"
I have family who live in ireland and I live in the states i can understand everything they say when I go on holidays but I love listening to different accents at the moment I miss my family so jack you make me feel better every time I hear you talk it's beautiful not to mention I love your videos cause your awesome.
jack you should teach us how to do your accent
Jack has just lost a bit of that accent he may have had at the beginning, but it's still in there! Talking generally with less of an accent, but it'll still come out from time to time! Also I'd assume Madeleine's video is more for theater or singing perhaps, where emphasis helps a lot. An obviously Irish accent will likely have a good few of those recommendations!
I've been waiting for Jack to watch the Guide To Irish Accents for such a long time 😂
Why is no one talking about THOSE EYES!!! THEY ARE AMAZING!!!
I feel bad for mickey. like he just wants to be on his farm with his sheep!!
Flower = flare
I think Brad Pitt was supposed to be doing speaking in an Irish Traveler Cant, but I don't remember very well, it's been ages since I've seen that film.
0:52 The *H* erb
Me still waiting for a LAUGH video and a video about the Slap Chop
Watching Derry Girls in comparison to Mrs Browns Boys is such a shock for me because I didn't think the accents were that different.
Yo Sean, how come you haven’t done a series on Ghost of Tsushima?
As a non native speaker, I can't understand a thing ngl.
as someone who struggles with understanding accents in general, this is a wild ride
Heavy Irish v Heavy Dorset?
Ireland is the iM nOt LiKe OtHeR gIrLs of countries
mirrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
Sometimes I forget that Jack has an Irish accent, I always just put him in his own category. Is that weird? :>
The guy with sheep sometimes sounded like the TV when you're falling asleep
Can't wait for the english version.
i understood most of this however im scottish so yeah
How the actual f*ck did you know what he was saying about the sheep?? But I do understand the Cork accent pretty good lol.
They should have casted sgt ducky!
*Why is Australian the 5th most sexiest accent we sound terrible*
20mins of Jack being homesick
"Top of the morning to ya" is the exact equivalent for "Chuck another shrimp on the barbie" for Australians
12:58 "What the fuck, Richard?" 2.0
The highschool boy warning about frostbite looked like a whoville citizen
fun fact of the day: if you search up the most attractive accent you'll find.. Well.. Not Ireland, oh how wonderful it feels to be a kiwi
You can't miss the rain though right
8:06 that is not an Irish accent it is a Northern Irish accent there is a difference folks 😂
Hey Seán, I know you might not see this but if you do. I just watched the whole subnautica series again for the 3rd time. And just for one video could you go back to your old world and just stuff around with some stuff. It will mean the world to me.
Seans interpretation Christopher Walken trying to sounds Irish sounds like Gru from despicable me!!
Jack's accent is the best in my opinion   (jack told us to type which accident we liked so i typed mine)
Oh Jack.... what would I do without you 🤣🤣🤣🤣 always making me laugh an shit.
"Start drinking more milk, bitch"
Like music rap music
sean, are you wearing some eye makeup?
An Irish movie made by... not Irish people. Is that a foreign film for us, them, or the whole world? lmao
I can understand everything they’re saying is that weird I’m from South Carolina and that’s south south
There are 3 types of Irish accents   1: polite, calm and interesting to listen to 2: strong  3: ma shaep wa taken a foo moon noigh vfgrbtny fvgbyntgyh
16:19 jack wearing the top of the morning shirt while saying it is cringy
ORIGINAL COMMENT HERE!!! Alternative title : Jacksepticeye but his accent gets thiccer over time
"GO BACK TO BED KID"  Me watching this at 1 am with school tomorrow:  👁️👄👁️💧
Imma search a video now about Jamaicans reacting to Little Jacob and Badman's accent rude boys an tings
My friends told me I have a slight Irish accent in my English. (Pretty sure this isn’t a proper sentence but sure.)
Bruh I have been to County Kerry, and I walked past an elderly man whom I hardly understood because of this deep accent. That place is wild.
Jack sounds like arny
frosh but
Thank god, I was watching This House Has People In It, scared the crap out of me, this is the only thing that calmed me down.
0:26 germany to france 1940
Ladies with an Irish accent 👌
you can make a Video explaining the behaviour of birds and i'd still watch it Jack
Tried learning 5 different accents at the same time all it did is that now I cant even speak normally lmao
Sean.....your friend's wife is from Italy..............
Ireland has a Spar? I've never heard of a Spar outside of my country
‘just cast irish people’ welcome to the lives of LGBT folk! 😃
WHY DOES HE SOUND LIKE HE'S SPEAKING WELSH
I’m betting he made this video because someone called him a son of a truck’s mother. Dunno could be just me.
Being an Spanish that speaks English, these mad irish accents sounded more like a weird german than english 😂
Jai
Eat shit France    Sean-2020
Watching jacksepticeye slowly making me having a Irish accent 🤣🤣🤣
I feel like I'm hsving a stroke while Ii was listening too the guy talk about his sheep
for additional context, the character and accent that Brad Pitt is portraying is that of an Irish Traveller (which is a nomadic ethnic group in Ireland and the UK, for those unaware) and I honestly think he does a pretty good job in the accent department if you've ever heard a thick Traveller accent
Where ye from again seán
me being someone of Irish heritage and my family still having an accent despite being from the US then hearing THAT SHIT
That weird kid who plays fortnite: 6:46
I know we're speaking the same language, but I can't understand
We all love jacks accent
HAHA loved everything about this! Enjoyed every moment and every accent 😍
I think I like north Dublin the most
He speaking tongues my guy
10:26 that freeze frame tho
Jack should make a video were he listens too some Irish songs
Worst one has to be Tom Cruise
Hey jack are you ever gonna go back to the days when you play different types of games like dying light or skate 3 I miss the old times
AyE jAcK iF yOu WaNt To SeE a BaD iRiSh AcCeNt ThEn Go To YeR oWn ChAnNeL
I loved jack even more when i saw him talk shit about countries but stop just before Australia
When you google Wild Mountain Thyme, 90% of what comes up is articles criticizing the accents
I wonder who's gonna be animating Seán as JACKSEPTICAR!!! The vouelbender.
im from the somerset in england and i could understand every word said is there something wrong with me lol
I'm probably gonna sound like a complete idiot, but i didn't know other continents have a Spar XD I'm from South Africa and legit thought it was only us
Ireland? did you mean *_Scotland 2?_*
Hey Sean you ready for blue zero I know I am no clue when it will come out but Just watched the wholeee subnatica series like all 75 For the 5th time but still keep Up the good work your really funny and I’ve always wanted to be a YouTuber and you enspired me I might of been 5 years late when you started but I watch all your vids 100 subs to 25.7 million keep it up man keep pushing your positive mental aLtiTuDe
1:41 I thought he smacked her
Ok this thing is seriously bothering me... is jack wearing makeup? Like am I going crazy or do I see orange eye makeup?
The Irish have Alcohol in their blood. Some just have more than others
@jackspeticeye was this at all spurred on by you being in Hasanabi’s chat during one of his Top O’the Hour ad breaks a day or so ago? Lol
Jack: “Irish people don’t really say ‘top of the mornin’’  Also Jack: *[is wearing a shirt that literally says “top of the mornin’]*
Jack's Christopher Walken is better than Christoher Walken's Irish
I mean at least Jamie Dornan is Irish
not being an irishman i dont understand any of these accents and the jokes but seeing jack laugh makes me laugh
Sean: there is a different accent for every town in Ireland  Me a English man from Yorkshire: finally someone gets it we don’t all talk cockney or in a posh accent
I'm Irish. I dont have a thick accent but I do understand what the true Irish men are saying for the most part. I also love how Jack says " You know what WE need to watch?" Instead of "You know what I need to watch?" I feel included.
Sure this video is classsss
i love this video. thank you for it.
😂🤣 Jack you did a better job of translating than Kevin did! Thank you! 😂
How is it possible that I am Argentinean, still learning english and I could understand almost everything- HOW, JUST HOW
us as fans: mirror  Jacky boi: Mirrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
He described the pronunciation of "Mirror" exactly as I would have. "It's just M-I-and then just 15 R's. "Mirrrrrrrrrrrrrrr". What's a beautiful language.
i am was born in Ireland both me parents are Irish and people still say oh are you Swedish
can you play god of war 3 on your channel?
You sound more Walken than Walken sounds Irish lol
Let's be honest, every country has a region where few and far between understand what the hell is being said. This sometimes correlates to insults of animal relations and incest, but not always.
Me: <listening to the Irish couple next door violently having it out about something nigh unintelligble, with the husbando frequently calling her every profanity imaginable, usually along the lines of "fat cow"> My loins: <melts>  I dunno, the Cork rowin' boys were pretty easy. The sheep farmer I could only hear bits n' pieces of, oongh... the vocal coach made me giggle a little bit, especially with flour. Just imagining chucking a flare into a cake, mh.  I'm totally gonna steal that Irish Coffee pickup line on my girlfriend tho', yeh yeh.
sean mac and tis thigh
Jack don't celebrate you got voted sexiest accent because so did Essex and you don't want to be near that accent
he didnt even go anywhere near the north or west
I am currently learning Irish at Uni so this was just a great way to start off the morning xd Will have to chose the Munster dialect as the best because my teacher is from there :D
*YEA WAT THE FUCK JEFF!!*
this reminds me of boondock saints, good movie but what would i know, i was raised by that movie. Every st pat day
Jack i love Irish accents, but the thicker it gets the drunker the person sounds
Jack translating some of those accents feels like translating Deep South Boonies for city folk and non-Americans
"In English we say "I" ..."  Me: "Darling, you're American..."
11:17 I like how your trying to rebuke the voice coach by trying to say "park" and "garden" with an Irish accent but it just sounds like an American accent XD
Haha he didnt say anything about Aussie accents. I’m Australian. Love from the boys down under
As an Australia, Irish accents sound kinda normal same with British but it’s this American accents you immediately pick up on
....irish name... spoken 'shane' ...written..'sean' ...ye that makes sense ,but we all know irish is the first stage of madness so its not surprising.
The Scottish can be just as hard to understand. When my grandad was around if I read his face while he spoke I'd get it. On the phone, nope. Just chuckle and agree and hope you didn't upset him 😂
wait that's how i say mirror too is that not how y'all say mirror??
“Go back to bed, child!”  Me -under 18- watching this at 1AM: :|
ughhh so goood my ears have been blessed, i thank u
For the "Which Irish accent is sexists" I was waiting for someone to come in with the most incomprehensible accent.
Get Evelyn and do one more please.
SEAN MAC INTEEHEE gh
But I don’t want to drink more milk Mr Jack 0:42
I'm Irish and I'm having a hard time understanding him😂
kEeP iT iN tHe bLIndFoLD jEfF
Just a suggestion but i say one day for just one video you do your old intro and outro for like a throwback video or something
Reminds me of the dude played by Filch's actor in Hot Fuzz
Low key want more 😂😂 couldn’t stop smiling the whole video
omg the rower lads. they're VERY much from cork hahaha. they're cahrk bais!
You'll never go back to hoirland. You belong to os now!
if you want to really like irish humor check out foil arms and hog at the end the spar bag was the rubber bandit from the song horse outside
Jacksepticeye:music you call it. Music huh? Irish farmer: angry demonic chanting in the distance
The vocal coach sounds like the western conception of an Irish accent.
I don't think Brad Pitt was saying ngl
He has not changed that much im glad
Is it bad that I watch jacksepticeye so much that I can’t really tell his accent is getting any stronger
I was slightly offended the first time i saw the trailer when it came out
Love the Irish accent 💖 could listen to it all day long 😍
Hey jack you should do a reaction video to Spiderman ragdolls
I used subtitles to see what they        would say and if it matches up with what they were saying.........it didn’t 😐
Why was I called out for my south side Dublin accent?
What happened to the Intro
Is it weird that I kinda understand what is meant I am no Irish but yet weird enough it wasn't too hard to understand
The farmer kinda sounds like he is in an anime to me.
BEALACH AN DOIRÍN ❤️
JAMIE DORNAN♥️♥️♥️♥️
His accent gradually thickening? Anyone?
my siri is irish. thats something.
Not related but quarantine makes me wanna binge Jack’s Subnautica so much
"Ha ha eat shiit France" idk why I didn't expect that loool
I find different dialects around the world so fascinating. Irish accents are some of my faves. Thoroughly enjoyed this.👍
POV: you heard jack say drink more milk so now your checking the comments to see if DANI commented
Jack: Top of the mornin is cringe now Also jack: wearing top of mornin shirt
BRA Jack why your eyes orange?
Wouldn't it be frustrating if you're talking to each other in the same language yet you couldn't understand each other because of accents. Man, I surely will be one way or the other.
I'm from the Netherlands and remember in secondary school I had my final listening exam for English. The main part was two Irish blokes.... like excuse me I've been learning a second language in school and you expect me to understand this heavy accent?! No surprise, I failed that exam
11:46 Jack’s reaction killed me
Literally when I was 12 I new this was bad lol
*grabs cup of milk*
Thanks for not saying anything shit about the Australians Accent :D
Call me Kevin did it 1st   Still love your show tho
Jack then: (hiding Irish accent) Jack now: (Irish potato noises)
Daaaggs
Jack: i love Ireland. Also Jack: Leaves Ireland  Ireland: hmm... seems sus
I love Irish accents, so much variety, and I love when you talk more Irish.
I am here and you cant stop me jack
I'm Irish and jack ur killing me
Definitely thought those farmers were actually speaking Gaelic which is why I couldn’t understand ‘em. Nope, just the most Irish of accents.
I'd watch more of this cause it's just great to listen to
Ngl Wild Mountain Thyme looks good
LOL. One day, I will make it to Ireland.
plot twist: hes not irish hes just pretending
With English as my second language, I don't know if my English is getting better or worse by hearing those accents.  Also I like Jack's voice of that's in the option
Me - hears FrostButt Everyone - Hears frostbite
XD
That Jeff guy missed the opportunity to reply the "Hello there" properly
aye...                        ..don’t go throwing shade
Some of this sounds like terrible British accents
Jack: anyone faking an Irish accent sounds bad  The Australians: b r ö t h e r
You should do more videos with Eveline.
😂😂he sounded more german then Irish
English is that you?
THE NUBER 1 ACCENT IS CORPS
Coming from Scotland I can understand a thick accent
I think I understand about every other word I hear. So around 50%, is that bad?
Silly Irish man it’s Erb not herb
18:52  I found sight of the young jack, wish I could scream at him and say," you better play more SUBNautios"
The first farmer i understood bits of what he said but not all of it and the rowers i understood perfectly fine.
I was suprised wgen I could actually understand the irish accents
Tbh I had a hard time understanding a guy who was raised in south Irland I speak to online when we first started sending voice clips and video chatting, his accent isn't supper thick thanks to moving to Britain but after 7 years of being online friends, I can comprehend him much better.
Do it again
my family drink 4 gallons of milk every week
That irish guy that lost his sheep be like : asoeowqjeasdxkmcewkriosdjFAKINsarjijhasduirhywe8yhsdjkhrsda8u farty far
5:32  I couldn't understand what he was saying. It sounds like he was drunk or something   OH wait that would make alot more sense
Please listen to some Newfoundland accents (from Canada if you didnt know :P) They are like weird mixtures of Irish, Scottish and English depending on where you are on the island, It's where my family is from and it makes me laugh having people experience them XD
Hey sean are you doing a black Friday sale on your coffee
isnt brad pitts accent a particular subset niche accent
The sexist accent is one no one can understand
The farmer's accent is thicker than Gordon Ramsay's lamb sauce
THE SHEEP DUDE SOUNDS LIKE HOW FUCKIN SIMS TALK
His ascent Is great you d swear hes irish
I've been watching you so much that my Irish heritage all the way back from that Irish gentleman that banged someone back in me family tree... where was I going? Oh yeah, I'm starting to morph my own Australian/Irish accent. My S has a bit of an SH to it, and I seem to same TIME like an Irish fellow a bit then I feel embarrassed. I could go on!
I started growing grey hair 5 years ago and i just found out jacks age, he's 11 years old than me.
Me not North American, European, or Irish feeling left out
I like Russian or spanish accents more than Irish. Can't stand most English accents. I could understand all the Irish accents except the old dude talking about his sheep and I've only ever been in usa.
Why did you move away you traitor
Moral of the story, the less you pronounce your words unless you swear the more irish you sound
I decend from many different places, including Ireland and you can tell when I say certain words like "mirror" it just sounds like "meer"
Now I gotta look up what my Great Grandfather would have sounded like. Except I only have a vague idea of where he’s from.
You didn't react to the best Irish accent in the world. Conan O'Briens Irish accent.
this was a fun video. its nice when you don't do a video on a game or memes. it's just jack and the viewer
We get a similar thing with Canadian accents. The stereotypical Canadian accent is from a very specific part of the country. 😊
Sean Mac An tSITHIGH
Ooooo an interesting PAUSE on NI at the end there xD
Ooooo an interesting PAUSE on NI at the end there xD
Diaguit
proud irish sister!!!
Wait what about NZ sexiest accent...
The kid when he said frostbite it sounded like frostbut
When she pronounced "I" Sean looked absolutely revolted 🤣
These weird videos are the greatest
I’m in tears. This video is hilarious. 😅
Jack:I'm great at this! Also Jack:being irish
looking at the title. Me: IMPOSSIBLE
When i was a kid I thought Irish people spoke a completely different language
the farmers accent is the same as my dads side of the family wthh, he's right with the county kerry vhfdbvhakdj
Thank god I grew up knowing patois because everyone's accent is a bit easier to understand
he says well then find me after them that's right then you own them thats the first part i'n not saying the rest
Any1 from cork
I have a friend who has a cousin who's relative is partially Irish and hangs out with us whenever he visits, one time he even brought his Irish friends and we  toured them around the city and just listen to them compliment everything. I dunno what magic these Irish people have but the way they talk just makes me wanna smile & listen to them all day..despite not knowing half of what they are saying.
“Why didn’t they just cast actual Irish people!?” *Aka Jack secretly getting mad at the fact he didn’t get casted*
Great even Jack isn't sure if he's Irish enough
I have family in Cork. God help me if i ever meet them. Gonna look like the woman in that math meme.
I legit thought he made up lines at 6:12 to “translate”
Dont be sorry Sèan its so funny
i was so surprised with myself, my mum is irish and so is her family and i don’t have much of an accent but i could understand these people😂
I don't care at a 1:57 sounds like Moira Mctaggert from X-Men
1:46 here, and 2:55 in Jacks old vlog video “Vlog I LOVE NATURE A Day in the life of Jack”
That Irish farmer... His name wasn't little bo peep, was it?
do you like doggies
The vowel woman is doin a feckin galway and mayo accent
One of the most amazing and (weird)  accents are: Irish, Indian, Bangali, Scottish
pleaseeee do another one of these! it was so funny to watch
Thankyou jack i have not LAUGHED like that in a long time
I think we need a video of Jack going as Irish as he can to Evelyn (idk how to spell her name sorry lol)
12:57 "What the FUCK Jeff?" 🤣🤣🤣
Do you still have a sup a whiskey during vids off-camera?
The person watching the sheep news:ahshiilucslieteyfounmeh ahsusanpacyabagswermovintothanothanirelan. Edit:hey if anyone understands or thinks they do plz write what u think I said
North side Dublin!!!!!
This is the Jacksepticeye I subbed too!!
Anyone realize that Jack's "j" in his YouTube name is non-capital...         No? Just me?
Mikey sounds like a mummble rapper
Hey.  I UNDERSTOOD plenty of that.  Does that mean my Irish heritage is acting like a sort of translator?
My dude, my bro, if you think this is bad.... check out South African accents.
me: hears irish accent   also me: *spits water after listing to these accents*
Ah yes, I always fix my makeup in the mirrrrr
when they say “Ass” and not “aRs” 🥱
im not vocal teacher but im a wind instrument player. Getting lessons in academy from superb teachers. but she said : is izh.    i have no fippin idea if that ...... no wait. i tried saying... it feels that --- is it - tongue is very close to teeth. ----is izh ---- tongue is very far from the teeth .  maybe im wrong idk
Jack I just want you to know all Americans talk the same we don't have different accents okay
Jacksepticeye: I’m a vowel bender
the only thing i understood from this video was its title
next time do australian accents, ones you cant understand haha
mirrrrrrrrrrrrrrr is that how? did i do it right?
ol jack a boy, i remember your 1000 subscriber video, now you’re 25 million strong, the smell of success is rich, i love you man and thank you for making me smile through my breakdowns, you always bring a smile to my face
Hay i want to start a channel but i need some tips. I have a gaming  computer but just need tips for  starting.
2:20 - 2:25 Is it just me or did he sound like gru from despicable me
Now we need Felix to review some bad/good swedish accents
I’m irish and he is write
The mad farmer sounds Scottish
Sheep man is speaking a different, new language.
Irish accent : eyy lad ,  can he get me some spuds eh... I watched jacksepticeye Minecraft walkthroughs
I am a child and I’m watching this at 1:18 in the morning so good advice I should go back to bed
You wouldn’t be long getting frostbutt.
The guy who lost the 45 sheep didn't even sound Irish  just sounded like he was from the f****** what's it called from the f****** f*** f*** f*** s*** what's it called what's it called what's it called what's it called what's it called a different country
has anyone else been watching jack for so long that you dont notice hes irish  and when you hear anybody who sounds irish you just think theyre jack
The farmer be sounding like some ancient dwarfish
the Irish accent hurts my face
Hello all the way from silvermines tipperary
I’m Cornish and my Nan pronounced mirror as mrrrrrrrr
I tried to play a Gaelic D&D character, inspired by unus annus, but gave up on the accent cause we dont play often enouph for me to commit to the hardest accent in the world xD
Jack needs to react to Sheamus
i wish i had a spicy irish accent instead of a plain american one
Yoooo so I recently started watching DeeBeeGeek on youtube and I think Jack and DeeBeeGeek should do a collab some time, a fellow irish youtuber, I think it'd be cool :3
6:34 literally the best movie ever
when the farmer guy said “arvajoo gavin” i felt that
I love that Irish people just say whatever the fock they want and no-one criticises them because they have no idea what he's saying
We need more sean!
8:48 I Always thought i was weird cause i didn't move my lips when i talk turns out i might be irish
I love your accent. It's charming and idk, when I hear you speak in videos from recently I feel relaxed. You're a pretty positive and accepting person and it's therapeutic to watch your videos, especially with your accent (I know it sounds weird and you might not get it but it's a thing I've noticed). Your content helps me feel better.
Im surprised that CC was this GOOD
5:36 ELYTRA ????????
No Racism Involved But. 2:33 👈 This Sounded Indian
the reason you can't understand them is because your British not Irish
Jack does better Walken than Walken does Irish.
You are pretty easy to understand. I generally don't have a problem understanding people who speak English, Counties Kerry and Cork leave me wondering if they've gone back to speaking Gaeilge.
2:20 Jack: "He had a rock....tied to his NECK...." Idk, I think you could give Nolan North (Uncle Nolly) a run for his money on the Christopher Walken impression....
Nay, Irish accent isn't the sexiest accent nor France. The sexiest accent int he world is the Scandinavian accent or how the vikings talk
It was grand
County cork I think has the thickest accent and is my favourite
Boggers. Boggers everywhere.
It was fun, I laughed a lot, thank you. Very much!
Walkins trying to be Irish man  huge fail  Irish man trying to be walkins huge success
You wanna hear my Irish accent?
Nah man, German accents do it for me.
I'm from cork so the lads from cork were easy to understand
In the new Moominvalley cartoon that woman from Titanic (can't be shoved to actually remember her name) plays Mrs. Fillyjonk. I can't remember if she's supposed to be Irish or Scottish but she sounds ambiguously European so either way. . .
I think I heard Terroriser at the last sections of the vid.
That Walken impersonation was pretty good... And to think you can't even do Greenpewdiepie's intro anymore.
The problem is there's like 40 vastly different Irish accents and a good number of different dialects with their own slang and such so that tutorial might be really good for like ballybeg two miles up the road there but when you go down past the yellow house no one will understand a word you say
"dis dat deez and does" ah ya mean a Chicago accent
No one:  Jack: Sean Mac ntity
19:42 sheep?
I want Jack to teach me his irish ways, the american accent is boring as fook (no offense to my fellow americans)
I could barely even see the rower's mouth moving
25million I love you bro keep growing 😭😭😭😭
Irish accent is just like a different language      Lol
Jack might be the best person at saying bitch ever to exist
I love that, when the vid got to the farmer & his sheep, even YouTube's subtitles were like ¯\_(ツ)_/¯.
Why is russian not the sexiest accent
loved this im irish myself and was laughing even before jack was cuz I picked up on this stuff  keep up na  good work there love your vids
Im upset!!😄
Loved it
Omg!! This made me laugh so hard! I hope jack does this again!
Farty feive vats a large load of sheep
Not at all trying to sound racist i promise! but being American is a oof when I realize it all sounds the same to me  XD Also Sean i have watched you for so long that at times i forget you have an Irish accent lol
Being from Limerick I feel that my accent started getting richer as I watched this video just like Jack's did😂😂
The farmer didn't even try speaking English anymore, bruh
This is off topic but, I'm drinking this juice and it tastes like the smell of cheap perfume.
I almost had a stroke watching this
Jack laughing at all the Irish people while they talk. Meanwhile me watching like: 😯
Damn I never knew mr Conor mcGregor was from the northside
I'm not even Irish and I'm cringing lol
Over the entire video his accent just gets stronger and stronger and I loved this so much ahh I was just cracking uppppp
Ya wan kanobi.
i just realized jack had eye shadow on
This is by far your best video in MONTHS! Thank you for the quality content!
0:42 I was actually drinking milk when he said this almost spat it out and cried
I can see where the Canadian maritime accents come from now, especially with those farmers 😭
Loooved this video 👍
Jack: so many people butcher the Irish accent Australians: welcome to the club
I mean, I guess Mr. Grey is Irish irl lmao
The video wasn’t loading for me, so it was just in the background and I forgot about it. And like 15 minutes later, it loaded, started, and scared the shit out of me
I live in Scotland. I'm insulted 😭
"Everytown in Ireland has a different accent" Yeah so does the south in the United states but everyone believes "southern" is one and all ,but yeah...that now true some people in Texas sound way different than in Alabama or Georgia for example.
jack needs to react to the viper from the hardy bucks
new zealand sexist no cap
Jeez irish accents are something huh? Beautiful ❤️
I don't know why but i understood them and I'm a New Yorker. Maybe it's because it sounds like they are talking fast so i just get it
The dogs face at 5:38 is my face going what the 🤬 Jeff????? 😂😂
"There are a lot of examples of people trying to do Irish accents who don't have an Irish accent, and it just sounds absolutely dreadful." *Flashbacks to the UA accent video*
Yo jack, *Remember to kiss yo Homies.*
Jacks videos don’t have nearly as much energy and compassion compared to his old ones really makes me bummed out
Everyone but the ol farmer I understood lol my poor American ears lol
I can barely understand Scottish and Welsh accent but holy heck Irish accent is blowing my mind.
Ive been watching Jack(sean) for like 7yrs or more and I can do an amazing accent *screams intensely*
That Irish farmer reminds me of the old man in Hot Fuzz who had the sea mine.  Edit: made this comment before Sean said that.
I am still trying to process what people are saying in the first minute
This was incredibly fun.
Brb going to listen to Robert Sheehan speak
Which part of Ireland did you grow up in jacksepticeye
And yet no one realized  that name is clearly SEAN MAC ANTi's THIGH
I genuinely would love it if Sean makes a series just about Ireland. Just talking about the different regions and experiences he’s had there. Or even just going through other accents like American, French, or even Southern U.S. and having a laugh.
MAKE MOREEEEEEE OF THESE
Do this with boondocks saints @jacksepticeye lol......one of my favorite movies of all time
Jack: "Music ya' call it?" Also Jack: *awkwardly* "music..."
the farmer almost sounds like he’s speaking swedish 👁👄👁
I’m so here for this video and entertainment.  Not Irish but family is from Scotland and when my mum orders food they sometimes struggle to understand certain words she says. 😂😂 so I’m sitting next her, yelling out the window in my Aussie accent so they can understand
Hey that's mean I'm Italian I'm sad now because I've been watching you since I was 6 years old and you were still my favourite YouTuber
oh god I can't even speak English properly and this is just to much for a B1
My grandad Has an accent exactaly like the farmer
when the irish person makes a better impression of christopher walken than christopher walken makes of an irish person
Snatch is one of my most favorite movies
When the farmer talked I thought I was having a stroke
5:46 We have learned that NO MATTER where your from, if you from the south, you have a heavy accent
Jack be like "the lassie's wrong, oi'll show her"
That's not even English anymore
This was hilarious!
13:30 “Hello there”, “hi” bruh really missed his Kenobi reference opportunity
Wait lads, anyone else notice the grey hair...?
God, Ireland is blessed. I wish farty fife shep gun missn oot ahnte moonten was my biggest problem.
Hey jack I got a question ik u probably won't see this but I been getting rumors on my tiktok that u don't believe in god is this true
Jack: laughing   Me:what tha fuck are they saying.
Jack: I’ll translate for you Me: ok C3PO
That accent is how a stroke feels

Even Sean says to drink more MILK!!!
Nah russian accent is very sexy.
I died when he said "What the fuck Jeff"
My friend is Scottish );
0:36
That sound like german abit
dude just got done smoking a fat blunt look at his eyes bruh
*Me understanding some of these* Maybe I'm Irish?
RIP that time Sean reviewed Unus Annus' attempts at an Irish accent 😂
15:50 Sorry for another comment but I'm so gay for the lady from Cork, holy shit...
When Jack says "Uy'll" ahahaha
Hey Sean, did you every see that the Facts Channel reacted to your content?
Haha he didn’t want to say anything about Australian haha
The one with brad pit is just supposed to be absolutely stupid
Jack: saying how bad people Irish accents    Me who thought it was British: :l
20:00 wait a sec........THE SPAR IS IRISH we haveit in the netherlands 2 XD
That transition @19:10 had me dying of laughter. Love your content man, keep up the awesome work!
I used to have an internet friend who was Irish and one day he asked if he could call me. I could not understand a word he said. I just sat there going "Uh, yeah. Uh huh. Okay. Alright, I'll talk to you later." I felt bad that I couldn't understand him but I didn't want to be rude either.
he's watched the video (Irish Farmers Lose Their Sheep, Mad Accent) for 8s and and it felt like they were talking for 8 min
The disrespect to the Northen Accents
Sean took a step backwards
The proper reply to Top of the morning! And a Bottom of the fifth to you.
Jack looks like a default nord in Skyrim
Australian accent is fifth as the most sexist- *happy Australian noises*
I’m Australian and I can understand a lot more than I thought I could
In convinced that yall have a different language and just call it english
I only recently found out that I'm part Irish ( and Scottish )   so it makes sense that I can actually tell what the farmer is saying
The old dude wasn’t speaking a language other than English?
I feel like the heavy accented irishmen didn't open their mouths, like they talked with clenched teeth - which made it hard to understand because the words just flow together 😂🤣😂
10:25 yes i liked and subscribed.... to madeline harvey and not jacksepticye, thanks for recommending her to us sean
It almost sounds like an entirely different language.
17:02 I didn’t realize I liked girls with freckles until now. She cute. No cap.
Jack: T’s make an s-h sound Me: I love poshashoes
Sean doing an English accent was so pure 🥺🥺🥺🥺
Please new spiderman video already
Random thought, just finished watching the escapist series and thought it would be epic if you and robin or someone else perhaps to continue it🥺
6:57 This accent reminds me of the dude in the Eurovision Father Ted episode talking about the bucket and throne flyin'. 😂😂😂😂  (yes I know Linehan is an absolute bastard but I still can't let Father Ted go yet...)
Bro hes funny he should make a youtube channel
Thank you for the translation Seán 😂
While Felix announced GAMING MONTH, Seán should announce Irish month, a whole December of him playing with the Irish lads
Me being over here half Irish and half Hungarian, but grew up in Australia so I don’t know how to speak like either country. 🤷‍♂️
how old is jack, he looks like he's 50 wtf
just to clarify i wouldnt touch her with a nine foot pole with a bit a shit on the end of it.
Left a like.  Even if I didn't understand a word the entire video.
The gamers accent had me wondering if I even knew English, it's SO Irish it's almost it's own language
I know that your Irish so this video makes sense but I wolud love to see more accent videos. If you were to do more I would suggest Newfoundland accents next.
I noticed I could only understand the schoolboy because it sounds just like a Midwestern American accent.
Imagine jack interviewing saoirse ronan one day
Hey Jack Listen To Bag Pipes pls
Because frostbite already happened, they were just frostbit a while ago
It sounds like Korean
Jack: [Brad Pitt] doesn't do that thing that EVERYONE does with an Irish accent! Jack: TOP OF THE MORNIN' TO YA (is jokes 😂)
lower the background music when you play something
Grow the beard long!!!!
Nice eye...  (Waves hand round face)  Stuff.
Why are the corner of your eyes yellow?
all i hear is Sean from red dead 2 and Mimir from God of war lmao
i worked as a customer service rep for a while and the accent I'm most afraid of was the irish accent.
also we belgians are pretty much the same every town and city has a different dialect, and unfortunatly i don't understand alot of them
When Jack flex his irish skills
Bruh I’m Irish but I can’t speak it I needed someone to teach me
Wtf Jeff 😂😂😂
Isn't Jamie Dornan Northern Irish?
that was Grand, love it
Brad Pitt was playing an Irish gypsy, which is why he sounded weird.
5:27 Farty five?
2:21 wow you out-Walken’ed Christopher Walken so hard that I nearly spit my milk out
I understood 0% of the mad accent guy
"Start drinking more milk bitch" Sean 2020
I'm from Newfoundland, and the accent here can be a bit like those Irish farmers. I worked with another Newfoundlander overseas who was also a low talker. He was administration, and the rest of the staff knew I was from the same province, so they'd often look to me when he was particularly incomprehensible. I wish I could have helped them. :D
The accent with the farmer was very thick and hard to like understand honestly Irish accent sounds good
When Jack says" love" in his Irish accent, I just melted a little.
The schoolboy was like shrek
The mad accent guy for an English guy sounds German? Is it just me?
you heard of ingrish! you heard of the doofenshmirts house of russian, now ,get READY FOOOOOR! e'ridsh
IRISH ACCENT ACTIVATE
I'm a filipino and my accent is burned into me that speaking any english words sounds.....weird Totally can't relate to any of this but it's fun
You look like elijah kamsky
well kevin is 100% irish and yet he hardly understood it, but jack does understand, i am very confused
Never have I ever heard of something I feel so familiar yet I understand none
6:16 Bruhhh you givin me mad Hot Fuzz vibes!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣👌  Bruh I wrote it just before Sean said it 🤣🤦‍♂️
I understand most of these because I have grown up with a fully Irish step dad who’s family is entirely from cork and half the time it sounds like.  hgjohohhohcohhocoohhohdhodfohodohdgidhxkggkcgochkcgkddohdo
the olympians sounded so similar to a jamaican accent that i didnt actually find it that hard to understand them
0:53 bleecker st?? We gonna see Doctor Strange??
I want him to react to sean in rdr2
I've got Newfoundlander in-laws and the farmer was still too much for me xD
SPEAKING OF THE IRISH can we get the irish youtuber gang to play some Among Us together???? I need to see CallMeKevin's absolute chaos added to the mix of all the rest of your 9000+ IQ plays
Tom Branson from Downton Abbey pretty good
Is Seán wearing eye makeup or am I just crazy
When for a few seconds you start to hear Gru from Despicable Me
You just have to listen to one word from corpse and you will put the American accent at number #1
Saying fuck off backwards is saying fuck off in irish
he's probably had this idea since that one video from unus annus
Hi
Do the fake lilies at 1:33 bug anyone else? They don't look like that normally and it's unsettling to look at. 🤦🏻 In reality they're like long leaved bushes with the flowers growing up in them. I know no one prob cares but gah it's killin' me. 😂
Anyone else reminiscing about 2 men 200 accents?
he knew not to fuck with australia hahaha
Hey Jack
Sean when france gets an upgrade"👁👄👁"
2:24 you sound like frickin Arnold Schwarzenegger
It's been so long since I watched him and he's paler.
Am I the only one who heard farty-five
Music you call it *music*
Yelling “what the FUCK Jeff?!” for any reason starting now 🤣
who else noticed his hair is turning gray
I can understand the Irish accent though? When it’s super thick it just reminds me of Russian English accent
Almost released my Dingo’s when I saw Australia on the top 5 of sexiest voices, and he just missed insulting the Australian accent lmao
"What the ****, Jeff!" - Jacksepticeye 2020
Heyyy
This is helpful for working on my own. I have a decent Scottish accent (Think Ruthie Connelly from SUpernatural), but I can't seem to get the Irish one down
I can understand some of what he's saying
I have an Irish accent and a speech impediment so fun
Okay, but the longer the farmer clip went, I felt like i understood it better..
Try to understand a Glaswegian accent..... all my friends I had to translate too. Couldn’t understand my mom
The Irish is accent is my favourite. I could listen to it all day! The Matchmaker made me fall in love with it and one day I’ll get to visit 😍
Thank goodness for a straight man that can appreciate the handsomeness of other men.
6:07 even the subtitles can't keep up with the old guy
I’m Irish ...        No fucking clue what that shepherd was saying
Brad Pitt doesn't play am Irishman, he plays a gypsy in Snatch
This was like the Irish version of some of OzzymanReviews videos
Subtitle be like : "Irish noises"
am i the only one who misses his "top of the morning to you." intro?
Jack accent through the video 📈📈
I'm Australian and can normally understand any accent pretty easily but god damn that one with the sheep is blowing my mind. It's the first time I haven't been able to understand an accent lmao I can make out what the man is saying out at the end "it's not all that difficult, all you gotta do is have a good dog. Have a good dog, go at night, some moonshine night, just put that dog around them, put them on a trailer and walk them"  now, after typing that out, that guy looks hella sus, he knows exactly what to do
Dude sounds like hes speaking danish...
Try War of the Buttons
Which irish accent are you considering here, irish or fake irish
I can't even do an Irish accent and I'm Irish.
Hey jack love your vids and keep up the good work
Actual NZ got the most sexiest accent bro
I'm from Illinois, and my Southern friends think that I have a super thick accent and they can't understand me sometimes lmao
I immediately thought of hot fuzz when the guy with sheep started talking lol
5:28 why does it sound like he's saying "farty-five"
A female Irish accent drives me nuts in the best way.
The sheep farmer sounds like my grandfather he was born somewhere in south Ireland
I love looking at my mirrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
When I saw that Brad Pitt clip 3:14, it reminded me of the first time I watched Sean aka TheSepticBeast
i wanna see more of sean just laughin at irish accent videos
"Eat shit france" Me the only american born child in my French family: understandable have a nice day
I found out I'm part Irish
"I kinda want to watch it though, at the same time. I just wanna watch it and kinda giggle at everything that is happening." I fell you Sean, as someone from the south US, and "Cowboy" or "Southern" movie that comes out I watch to see them do a TERRIBLE "Southern" hick accent. We can't even get our own accents right. XD
I want more of this, I laughed so damn hard.
I’m in love with this video. I needed this
I'm not even from Ireland and even I say Mirrrrr/Mearrrrr Do people really say mirror? I feel outa the loop...
mate, this is the same complaint Australians have ALL THE TIME
Christopher Walken is a damn L E G E N D
I thought all of them except one were funny
“But in and Irish accent we say oue “  I think I almost pissed myself watching jacks face
I think that the Farmer is just speaking Irish.
I would love to see an irish person try to "irish good bye" me. Not only is half my family irish and I know what they doing, BUT IM FROM THE MIDWEST I TELL YA, AND I GOT ABOUT 7 CONVERSATIONS PLANNED FOR A GREAT GOOD BYE AND  YOU CAN BETCHA I CAN THINK OF SOME MORE AS IM TALKING ABOUT THEM.
*Audible confusion*
Honestly the Irish and Aussie accents are similar
He sounds like he has a sack of potatoes in his mouth
Watching this was like watching the  "what english sounds like to foreign speakers" video
God I'm Irish but ill tell you what lads I have no effin clue the one girl from "Kerry" was on. Like bloody ell she ain't from Kerry she's from feckin somewhere but it ain't Kerry for Jesus sake
The thumbnail already cracked me up again ^^
If i could understand the accent of the irish farmer, i'd be the proudest man in the world.
You tried your best subtitles you’ll get there one day
I understand a little over half of what they're saying
when jack forgot to turn off sage mode
I like how the further Sean gets into this video, his "translating" for us slowly just sounds more and more like the videos that are nearly impossible to understand. 😅
6:02 when you have been around someone way too long and know exactly what they're saying when they're mumbling or crying (best friends, moms, siblings, spouse's, all them would know that stuff)
I mean you were born with it and I love lol
why can't they get a real irish person to play an Irish person
I think it’s really cool to hear Irish people talk about Irish accents, and culture too! It’s fun to learn about
I'm 30% irish and 15% scottish yet I have zero accent can I teach me🥺
I understand nothing
God those Skibbereen lads are hilarious, they make me holler everytime
Irish has the most *Gorgeous* accent ever!🍀
JESUS
Now, I have never heard any Irish other then Jack here, Yet I could understand wowed for word, what sheep man was saying with out Jack’s translation.
Sean should go back to Ireland someday to make a video just trying to find the person with the thickest accent in town. Maybe talk to them and get to know a little bit about them and where they came from. Show a little bit about the boots on the ground culture over there.
I'm an Aussie, and I can just barely make out what's being said hahah
in 2:21 Sean actually kinda sounds like Arnold Schwarzenegger  correct me if im wrong but dont be to toxic
When I was a kid I thought that Iceland was same as Ireland, Scotland was at Asia, Great Britain meant England and England was at America.
11:53 "fleur" 🤣
Jack lost part of his accent
Partition for jack to make a music video and name the tittle rap septiceye
I could understand the rowers perfectly
Jack I love you I remember when you were gone for like 2 months and it was so bad I had nothing to do I love you sm your amazing and I loved the god of boy series your channel is amazing ❤❤❤
is it weird that i could under stand everything this guy was saying
farty five sheep edit: *frostbutt*

Thank you for posting a lot lately, your videos really help with the big Sad's.
*confused American noises*
when he said go back to bed child, I felt it...I am currently watching this at 12:30 in the morning 😂
(Boys we haven’t even been out here a day, and were already worshipping a fuhkin potato) Jacksepticeye 2020
in michigan, we say "mir" instead of "mirror" too
"Why don't they just cast people who actually fit the description?"  Because Hollywood gives no fucks about accuracy, only box office outcome.
Guess jacksepticeye is family guy and callmekevin is the simpsons
I can understand most of what the sheep man says and all of frostbit boy
When you first said that farmer was Irish,  I was thinking “That guy isn’t Irish, he is German.” How wrong I was...
well now i want to know if all my irish ancestors were from kerry and were near fehkhin ihmposhibwle tou oundershtahndh
top of the morning black tea when?
why do they dye there sheep? .,.
I watched this with captions on and I'm crying
you should react to the "american hillbilly" accent lol
0:40 I'm in bed drinking chocolate milk and I'm 12 soooooo your welcome?
Richie did look like a lad tho
Me before jack repeated them more clearly: 👁👄👁 wut?
Top of the evening to ya
As someone with a heavy Irish accent, this is just awesome. And yes, us from Southern Ireland can hardly talk to eachother most the time
Jack spedicy.....the VOWEL BENDER!
For those of you who couldn't understand the farmer here's subtitles     *read more*
i has question who else preorder  cyberpunk 2077?
I love how Jack is able to easily translate what the Irish farmer was saying, but Kevin couldn't understand wth he was talking about. The difference is so interesting!
*I'm From Columbus Ohio But Live in Kentucky & The country Accents get Thicker than molasses. I feel for Ya Jackie Boy* xD
Jack you got grey hair now o.O
Nogla is an incomprehensible Irish man sometimes
Me: "Damn, that's a good Irish accent" Jack: "THAT DOESN'T SOUND IRISH AT ALL" My Impressionable Ass: "yeeeeah right that's a horrible Irish accent yeah..."
I absolutely needed this today. I love it when you make videos about Ireland and just Irish things. It always brightens my day even though it gets dark at 5pm lol. I don't think I have a favourite one, I like them all. 😂😂😂💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
I love how everyone is mentioning the farmers accent, yet no one is mentioning the “go back to bed child. Start drinking more milk bitch!”
I say mirror like "meer"
Please make this a series.
We have spar in south Africa
This is a random question who remembers his “all the way “ song on happy wheels
Poataytoe
Im aussie and my partner is born and raised inner city Dublin. It brings me so much joy when he gets mad at something or worked up because his accent gets so thick! Though to be fair, he says I do the same thing, god forbid we get into a fight, aint nobody going to understand what the hell we're on about.
How the fuck is Scottish accent nr 3? It's the least sexy accent ever
In an American country accent, I say Flower like Flyer
Anyone notice his board? 😂
I'm a funny short kind of chameleon like, the more I'm around people the more I pick up their dialect and pronunciations. But they missed out on the best pick-up line ever, hey baby can I get in them jeans, I just s*** mine. But what do I know, I like my coffee like I like my women... cold and bitter.
Is it bad that I understood everyone but Brad Pitt and some of what that sheep herder was saying
hahahaha the ending though
me 7 years old jack go drink more milk b i c h me :(
Farty fife?
Everyone always freaks out about casting...there is such a thing as faces that put butts in seats...Christopher Walkin is one such face that puts butts in seats. There is no more thought than that.
TBH this should be a new series on the channel, just Sean reacting to accents 😂
Everybody needs their own personal Irish person, it’s just a necessity
I am Irish and yes some of these are even hard for me to understand xD.
someone plz put captions on this video it needs them
i mean, if someone from ireland heard me using deep midwestern slang theyd probably have no idea what im sayin.
I'm not an irish but I can understand a little bit because I have an irish friend who has a strong accent
I loved all the accents. The farmer’s accent was very thick indeed. The Irish Women in that pickup line video had lovely accents and were gorgeous. The the fake Irish Women was still gorgeous even faking her Irish accent. I wish I could see more Irish tv series. I miss Father Ted and My Hero (lead in My Hero played by Ardal O’Hanlon from Father Ted)
That old sheep farmer sounded like he was speaking literally Gaelic Also react to really Australian people, we are alot easier to understand but still sound stupid and funny
One of me favorite childhood movies was the luck of the irish but now I feel like all the accents were fake. Me childhood be in runes. ;-;
Seàn: even some Irish people could have a hard time understanding him  Me who's ESL: well, guess I shouldn't feel that bad then 🙃 Thanks for translating Seàn 🙏🏻
Jack is google translate for irish accents
I was pretty confident that I'd be able to understand what sheep dude was saying, but I truly couldn't understand a word of it except for "bright". XD
Potato Potato, Potato?
I VOTE JACKSEPTICEYE FOR THE BEST ACCENT
Ze acshent of ze irISH wrealllllyy turnz meh on
Bro they all sound fucking jamaican wtf I was so confused
Speaking of accents and dialects does anyone know about that video about a village in northern Canada that speaks “English” but it might as well be a different language.
Just joined  the channel ive been subscribed for about 6 years
Watching it with captions is even funnier
Get in frost butt he says
the only thing i understud was sheep and it took me five mins to understand
Did anyone else hear forty five as farty five lmao 🤣
Sean whipped it out on them children 0:40
"The Cork accent is very strong" oh yeah, well explain Kevin's
This is how you sounded when you did Irish the Hedgehog that one time, I didn’t even know that this was out and I watched Irish with my mom earlier today
Damn when it said Irish accents were sexiest I thought at least 95% is just jack
9:16 ~ btw. these 2 guys thought it would be fun to make fun of the moderator with a thick accent. You can see it in the smile of the other dude.
On a trip to Ireland, I experienced three of these accents because our tour guides were from different counties. I had one from Kerry, one from Cork, and one from Dublin. They were all beautiful to listen to, but once I heard one of them speak Gaelic in the Kerry accent and I realized I do not understand any of their accents when talking to them. The only thing I got was Puck the Goat and which team they rooted for. xD And the phrase "What's the craic?"
If Jack’s accent just gets stronger the more he’s around other Irish people, I wonder what he sounds like in his natural habitat of Ireland.
I love the accents not the sound mean but I think it's kind of cool and funny how you say barrel not to mean please Jack don't get mad at me Lol
at 14:00 the video is stopped, as you can see he has the smart cast symbol. What other devices could he have connected to I wonder
U should U a Australia accent
The farmer is speaking Minecraft enchanting table
**remembers Unus Annus** Oh no
Ireland: *has it's own language by now * Jack: WE HAVE THE SEXIEST ACCENT!!
i cant understand a thing happening w the farmer,, like,, all i understood was 'sheep'
Me: plant a flouwr mate Also me: *Points a flare gun at the ground*
so i was trying to understand everything and i cant understand merely anything
Snatch is one of my fav movies lol
im iresh
Sean i have a question Do you sent your coffee or hot chocolate to iran? Cuz i live in iran and i realy want to try your hot chocolate
Flare?
It would be funny to do a whole video in the thickest accent possibly
hard but i got it
19:15 that dude sounded EXACTLY like Jack
Jack should teach us HOW to do an Irish accent
Im jamaican and those rowers almost sound like us 🤣🤣🤣🤣 its the pronunciation of  certain words
36th on trending
I used to have a mix between a Scottish and an Irish accent but I lost it and I’m kinda mad about that
Sean being worried that the video wasn't cohesive enough to be entertaining, but little does he know... Sean doing anything that makes him laugh makes me happy
i really wish i had an irish accent i love them wow
A few irish accents calm me down when I'm too stressed and jacks voice and attitude make me wanna laugh my troubles away
Hahah i think they’re just lazy to open their mouth while speaking hahahah. Great accent though.
If the vocal coach added a bit of swearing, then it would sound more authentic.
believe that when people mimic the Irish accent, they sound a tad bit Scottish
watching this video made me realize that northern americans (northern states in the US) have little undertones of Irish accents. so cool!
I wonder if the old jack who started this Chanel and uplaoded his first video I wonder did he ever think he would get this far
I just saw you on tv so congratulations it’s insane to think of when I first started watching you and comparing it to now keep up the great work your such an inspiration to so many people 👍
"i wasn't calling your mum a tart, i just meant.." that is just sounds so funny to me 😭
Why wasn't that video of Sham from Killarney included?
i wont to see him play the Irish bois again
0:23 Marzia: *sad pasta sounds*
fros'but.
You should play Rock of Ages 3
i have a irish accsent y the fuck  i aint got no girl i forgot i watch anime
I can here almost all of them
I bet Kevin could understand it.
A legend 😂🤣😂🤣😂
My top 5 1. Irish 2. British 3. Swedish 4. English 5. Italian
When he mocked walkins he sounded like gru
i see the mirrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
I like how Sean started doing videos with the Irish Lads. It just unlocks his Irish side and you can tell how he feels so comfortable and at home with the lads. I hope he does more with the lads.
I understood the news reporter and a little bit of the giy
That farmer is speaking terms and conditions bro
I really want to see him rate more Hollywood Irish accents, like The Boondock Saints.
These are the people that speak directly to the potatoes
I think the most sexist accent is seán
after everything youve been through your vids are the best and you make my day all the time
When I got to the end I didn't want the video to end
Okay but what do you think of The Boondock Saints?
Jack I’m proud to say I am also Irish
Sean you need to rate how bad Sean Connery's Irish accent was in the movie Darby O'Gill and the Little People. If you can survive 🤣. But seriously, Sir Sean Connery Rest in Peace.
I was hoping for a big thick Dundalk or Drogheda accent for Louth 😆
Hey Sean, here is a joke for you: An Irishman walks out of a bar ;)
The only people who have been bred throughout the years specifically so Fetal Alcohol Syndrome no longer affects them.
I've been watching Seán so long I sometimes don't even recognize his  accent, but when my friends hear his voice for the first time they always point out how "strong" his accent is 😂 and I only hear it when he exaggerates it
"There's lot of examples of people trying to do an Irish accent [...]"  Unus Annus....
Jack has a beird now and im not used to it for some reason.  edit: I am now
I fecking loved this
I dont understand a spect of this video
More of you going down the Irish hole please.
every one in the world: why is your accent so thick  irish people: Were just different
The Irish accent definitely isn't the sexist. I would say its either Hispanic or Australian. But of course thats my opinion
Subnautica below zero please
Oh man you really gotta do more of these videos! They're so much fun to watch & listen to! And the Northern Dublin accent is the best out of the bunch
I love this so much I wanna move to Ireland
I don't want to ruin any sort of vibes but I just wanted to say that you've helped me through a lot of tough times and I found that whenever I was sad I could come to your content as a distraction, so thank you so much
Oh my god I seriously loved this vid. I love when you talk about your country stuff :)
"dis, da, and daithi de nogla"
God this just reminds me that whenever I tell someone I'm from New York they assume NYC and they look at me like I have two heads like???? You don't sound like your from Brooklyn or the Bronx? No I'm sorry I'm from the armpit of the state don't mind me and my dull ass accent.
When I'm older I'm going to open up a bbq restaurant and call it butt stuff so a dudes girl will say hey babe let's try butt stuff and then he gets excited and then sad to find out that it's a restaurant then happy again when they find out its bbq
The only thing I heard is he took a pee in a couldron
I’m cringing and I’m not even Irish.
JACK u should do a video in an the most irish accent u can
You should look at newfie accents lol
Nobody:  The Sheep Farmer: Phlyyndragillionsandsflasingdagwillionbradsingollionanticyliangoghgoghgogh
I LOVEd this! And I love THE IRISH ACCENT'S. Scottish as well lol
As a part of the Irish community this video is great 😂😂
This was just a lot of fun to watch! I find it interesting that it' like that everywhere, where one accent can't actually cover the whole thing. Like everyone thinks they can do a "Texan" accent, but which one? Dallas? Houston? San Antonio? Heck, Plano or Balch Springs? I'm sure when you break it down, most accents are like that.
In Brad Pitt's defense, they explicitly say in Snatch that the Pikeys aren't exactly Irish and are more nomadic like Roma, so his accent was likely factoring that in.
Sup shawn my glocklin
The Boondock Saints is one of my all time favorite irish movies and I don't care what anyone says i love them. Although the second one was not as good as the first.
I miss the old videos don’t anyone else
That trailer is hard to watch, omg its terrible. Lovely veiws of Mount Neifin thought, makes the West look both beautiful and stuck in 1900 all at the same time. Lol. Its not just all farmers and feild past Ballina we live in 2020 too
When Jack translated, all I could think of was about the anime and their weird translations like:    "ワードワードワードワードジャックワードはいアジャ大丈"  "Okay"
Jack: "Oirland? I don't say it like that!"  Jack 2 min later talking normally: "I love Oirland so much"
Ah... good to know that everyone has a South where people find you hard to understand *cough* creole *cough*
Bruh, go a whole episode in an American accent, but like a crazy distinct one like New Yorker or Texan.
I feel like Sean barely sounds Irish anymore. Sometimes I almost forget he has an accent.
This is Jack just topping up his Irishness
"Doing an Irish accent is like doing a European accent or an American accent. There are so many dialects." THANK YOU JACK 👏👏
a human mouth cam form many words and accents and other things and as i am german also
Really enjoyed this one. Got to love the ol' Irish Accent.
I love when youtubers do reaction videos and it turns into them going down the youtube rabbit hole and just watching random videos lmao
Irish cringe gang right here. Like if you agree
Hearing in the last video about Limerick, and after recalling that Daithi De Nogla is from there, I totally understand now
I sooooooo loved this vid!
Seriously these accent videos are so broad you get a person from Texas and a person from new jersey and tell me they sound the same lol that's the beauty of the human condition so many different accents you can't pin it down to just the country I honestly wonder how many there is that are unique
I love the Irish accent
The dude from the RTE vid sounded like RTGameCrowd
This video gave me headache
This was very entertaining! Laughing a lot has given me more energy to study - thank you! Also, I think my favourite Irish saying that you introduced me to is "Who's after dying today?"
2:20 Jacksepticeye + Irish Christopher Walken = Arnold the Terminatoe man
I one point I heard: beaten boregon shnoggin.
I love this so much man. I am pretty good at understanding accents, even thicker ones, but I could barely understand the beginning guys who lost their sheep. They were rough lol. If anyone wanted to watch more funny accents I live in Kentucky, specifically western Kentucky. But Northern and Eastern specifically have HILARIOUS accents. Just in case anyone was curious lmao
Ha! "I'm a vowel bender"
Ive learned that to be irish all you just do is scream
Well I'm impressed he's so pure Irish he can understand the thickest mad Irish accent and actually get a coherent sentence out of it that's amazing other cultures always fascinate me
the irish accent is the most SEXIEST accent  me: SO THATS WHY YOU HAVE A LOT OF SUBSCRIBERS, WERE ATTRACTED TO YOU! NOW I GET IT!
FARLAWN AND MEELODIC! LMAO! X'D
“Oi ned ta harve a shiet.”
Can you play Fortnite
the media cant do aussie accents either and they always sound so bad
Hey jacksepticeye I just started playing river city girls with my nephew and I noticed a very familiar voice
I have irish dna and i understood half of it so i think i did good
I think my favourite part of your Irish videos is that all of a sudden, all of your Irish viewers come out of the woodwork in the comments and just seeing what they have to say about everything is so fun
8:08 Alternate universe G-Man
This was the best shit I've seen in a while lmao xD
The word that got me when I worked next to an Irish gal from Belfast was "house."  Finally got it after weeks of it being a joke, but yea, not easy to get the stress accents and the mouth formations correct.
Can you make an all the way remix.
Literally two weeks ago I was having that exact conversation about the sheep farmer and feeling like I was in that scene from Hot Fuzz translating. (I'm not Irish but I grew up top of Scotland with such a thick accent but had to speak slowly for English family)
3:33 Is that Avatar music?
What if when Jack becomes an old potato sage of infinite wisdom, and a belly full of coffee. Drops his accent and informs us it was all fake and he had been deceiving us for years with his claim as an Irish man.
U won te ays scrim meyt? Hye kent andoorstand me ayrish meyt  You want the ice cream mate? You can’t understand me Irish mate
WHEN SHE SAID JUST SAY OIL AND IT DID A CLOSE UP ON HIS FACE I STARTED CRYING REAL TEARS
ok jack but what about meme time???...
You should react to Derry Girls from Netflix!
Must be nice having your news be about Missing Sheep And not . . . other things  *crys in american*
I wanna learn how to lrish accents......... but how?
I laugh but deep down inside I know I sound like most of these videos but replace the "thicc Irish" with "thicc southern accent".
malk
Drunk is just part of Irish genetics, so it's no wonder you can't understand half of them.
"Top of the morning" we don't say that.... buy my coffee TOP OF THE MORNING
Me playing among us putting my name as Donald trump so nobody will vote for me
"Go back to bed child!" new insult
When I think of Irish accents I think of the country cork accent first 😂
I dot Kare wat hi tinks(close enough)
Irish Alex ovechkin
Vowel bender 😂
your accent isn't that strong jack, but when you nogla and terrorizer all were playing raft, the accent came out pretty bad lol.
*I'm gonna rememba tis video four long time* funniest part hearing this had ppl say I've sounded Irish or Scottish before but seeing this now I can't see it at all *laugh my arsh off*
Every single word from that farmer didn't sound like english
This reminds me of when my family went on a trip to Ireland and we met a nice older gent, I have no idea how my dad knew what he was saying XD
Honestly loved this
hello <3
Did... Did he just say... Herb with the H sound? Instead of erb?
Is it only me who thinks his voice  is like the voice of Dr. Doofenshmirtz from Phineas and Ferb?
Try to do Queenstown accent
I could understand a decent portion of the accents, even doe I'm a native french Canadien speaker who learned English as a 2nd language and no Irish family... weird
Now speak in every American accent
good thing he didnt make fun of the australian accent when he looked at that list of sexiest accents
2:24 you sound like Gru when you say that.
Anyone else remember that time Sean said that begging for more subscribers and saying "fun fact only 21% of people watching this video are actually subscribed..." sounded desperate, needy, and was super annoying? Or is that only me??? :3  (Its ok I still luv u Billbybob Mcginty pls dont ban me)
Brad Pitt’s character is a Gypsy... it’s a good accent when you remember that
9:10 Guy bouta cross Eminem with the Irish version of lose yourself  Arms weak Legs are Jelly I've lost 45 sheep already Get some ale with the boys and Terry
yeah just hire irish people lmaoo
This was great thanks.
Is it weird that after watching this back even without jack saying anything I could understand it
Anybody else found that his irish voice sounds like someone from despicable me 2:19
The thumbnail farmer sounds like he’s speaking German
Ah sure hope those farty-five sheep didn't get frostbutt
This feels like watching CallMeKevin's video a 2nd time.
Don't put too much weight on it.
Well then find me after them that’s right then you own them so you want them so you find them. Possible at night they be a full moon that I was liking? That’s all I could translate
I have a family friend from Dublin who has a thick accent so it took us a bit to understand her but I love listening to her talk
I totally get why you did this!  I am originally from North Carolina, and every now and then, I look up vids of people with the accent.  Also, i love the Irish accent.  So beautiful knowing I once had family who had the accent
I live in a state called Vermont in America and I say mirror the same as Sean😂
Where's subnautica
This feels like we're just hanging out and watching his favorite vids and losing "farty foive" sheep. I can catch the "cark" accent, the test not so sure.
I live in West Virginia, and somehow people round here sound like they took a ferry straight from Ireland
Hey Jack, us Americans can just say "whale oil beef hooked" fast to try and sound Irish.. 😆
im fricking drunk im having a blast jack pleas do a dutch version of this whit ya girl i wanna laugh on all the dutch accents aswel pleas do it shine some lite in this bloody dark corona days i need it hope ya seeing this
Jack should watch how to speak irish without knowing how
His face at 10:47...🤣
I loved this video
Im mostly irish but all my irish blood was from people with american accents so im unable to speak in the sexy irish accent which really sucks
At one point I thought my mind forgot English
After watching the young offenders a Cork accent isn't too hard to understand anymore
There are 3 types of Irish accents   1: polite, calm and interesting to listen to 2: strong  3: ma shaep wa taken a foo moon noigh vfgrbtny fvgbyntgyh
Is it just me, or was the farmer bloke not too hard to understand after Sean translated it once?  Maybe Kiwi's just have such a neutral accent that we can pick up anything and understand any accent...
There is no way that farmer speaks english. His Irish is on another level
After going through this you can definitely hear the Irish influence on northeastern American accents. New England and upstate NY in particular. Here in my walk of NY state you'll hear people call the car a cair, and so on. It's very easy to roll into faux-Irish from a central-western NY accent by accident, I've done it.
I'm usually pretty good at understanding some more difficult accents, but oh my lord this was something else
2:20 is he the terminator now
What if corpse was irish !!
Anybody else having Unus Annus flashbacks?
what it's like watching a Nogla video
Thank you for showing me that I wouldn't have been able to understand my Moore family's accent.
I feel like Canadian and Irish ascents  work similarly in the fact that ever place sounds different. And people can't understand the "hick" versions form towns unless they are from a town
You should make a video of of your mess ups
He had a rock tied to is neck in that voice = Arnold shwartsnagrt
I suppose. I suppose. He suppose
i don't understand how i can understand these accents im not Irish
Y’all remember that one scene in hot fuzz with the old dude with all the guns this is it
Idk if you guys notice but jacks hair looks whitened
Sees Christian Grey 😍
Jack: Irish people are just built different Some 8 year old: YEAH... WITH SOME EXTRA CHROMOSOMES!!!! Haha so funny. Wasn’t that funny, Joe? Laugh bitch. Yeah, that’s what I thought. I’m funny as hell.
Damn it makes me wanna go to Ireland even more!! My family came from Ireland long ago to the US so I wanna go back & see where my family came from
Try turning on subtitles some of the words it doesn't pick up
I'd like an Irish person's opinion: Cassidy from the show Preacher-- does he have an accurate Irish accent? I think the actor is English.  I'm American and have auditory processing issues so I can't tell for shit.
Watch water boy and try and understand the country man, I believe only us southerners can
Pls give a showt out to fre3fire pls he love's your vidoe's
@jacksepticeye hey can you please do your old intro and outro just once in your next vid? lol the good old Top of the morning, and if you Like it punch that like button in the face!! lol bring back the good old times
Today is three years since the beginning of my trip to Ireland and I miss it so much! I totally agree that it’s the sexiest accent. I sneezed walking down the street in Dublin and someone said, “Bless you.” And I thought I was going to swoon
Of course you can’t understand them, you’re not 100% Irish. Ask Kevin to translate.
Being from newfoundland this accent reminds me of home
When your half Irish and Half Austrailian   Me: NOICE
that old man though he sounded like he was just making random noises "a aug ight a beutyful mornin h the sheeps se sountin out." LIKE WHAT
Roses are red Oh golly gee I'm glad I went to Limerick for an English trip and I got fucking *s t a b b e d*
I love the Irish accent but it definitely ain't  sexy 😂
And the best instrument award goes to the bagpipe
im from Michigan, and i also say mirrrrrrrrrrr
Yooo, isn't that Blindboy Boatclub they used for Limerick? Rubberbandits Represent!
Seán: “this is all we do in Ireland. Run around in fields with our arms out.” 45 seconds later, we’re watching a news clip about missing sheep.
Being a Russian, watching American actors play Russian characters and do absolutely horrendous Russian accent in every movie ever is always a very painful experience for me, so I understand the cringe
About the only thing comparable to that deep Irish farmer's accent in the US would be maybe some old Creole in Louisiana.
16:01 her reaction KILLED ME
Please look at Irish Twitter next lol
To pity I no la ma go kar bu no mock mount the cannon on the cart
Christopher walkin in a winter wonderland
I was watching a meme time video and my mom who comes from Newfoundland and she thought that you were from there i just laughed and then I told her that you were from Ireland
Ok Irish accents are better than north Dakotan
Why does a really thick Irish accent just sound like super intense mumbling??
THEN YOU IS NOT IRISH, YOUR SWEDISH
S.H.E.E.P
jack you are the only irish man i can understand
I wish I could like this video more times. The Christopher Walken trying to sound Irish made my week!
I would love to see a part 2 to this
Irish and Proud😊🇮🇪 I am homesick tho, I live in Spain😢😂
Holy shit boys if ya goes for a stroll yull trip n’ fall one step out da doer
giggle-fest for sure
I’m upset cause it’s the anniversary of my grandpa‘s death he died on November 30th 2018🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺 I miss u grandpa always will miss u🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺
It sounds very similar to a Newfoundland accent
😂😂 great laugh and great video
Jack translating them is like me explaining to my friends what the fuck my grandmother just said. (She’s Irish)
l
There is a little Celtic shop in Pennsylvania where I live called "Oxford Hall". There is mostly Irish stuff there and Scottish as well, but there is some English too. I bought a hat there not to long ago that was hand crafted in Ireland which is pretty cool in my opinion. They sell tea and some "classics" in food choices and play the (sort of) stereotypical "Irish Music" non-stop. The man who owns it is always at the front check-out counter and is super nice and has been to Ireland multiple times. He has never had anything bad to say about it, so y'all must be doing something right (LOL). Overall it is a pretty quaint little shop. I like it.
Hey jack I know you probably wont see this and that it's been a few years but in episode 4 of life is strange when chloe is in a wheelchair, if you go into max's messages with Nathan it talks about  max working in the DarkRoom
WHAT?!?!?! XD
Also... More..more..more of these Irish videos!!
Watching you react to these was funnier than what was actually going on
10:30 look at the graph!!
10:26 you would think they would have an Irish person for it
I thought it was nogla 6:43
Also, at 2:22 he sounded like arnold schwarzenegger
6:44 have a Good dogin good dogin
Jack learning irish all over again 😂😂😂
I just learned I have some Irish in me
I have no clue what anyone is saying any more I’m so bambozald
When I lived in Scotland I found the further up north they were the harder it was to understand em.  I do agree the Irish accent is amazing. <3
I'm german,American and Scottish. Can anyone tell me what they are? am what to know.
Anyone else just legitimately forget that Sean has an Irish accent. I've been watching him for so long that I don't notice
man, I'm mostly irish but grew up in America, I had no idea alot of the ways I pronounce things would be similar to these accents
I love you Jack and your vids but my personal accent preference is from my French friend and my Spanish Latino friend :p please dont hate me people xd again love your vids Jack <3
You think copying irish accent is hard , wait till u see them trying indian accent
"There is no Irish accent." What the FUCK Jeff.
i like the orange around jack's eyes
I'd love to see another one of these listening to the accents in Boondock Saints
Except Christopher Walken isn't even an Irishman. Christopher Walken is a New Yorker
The fact that I didn't make it a whole minute in without laughing is exactly why Jacksepticeye is #1
What happened to top of the morning
the brad pitt one sounds pretty accurate to what it sounds like to an american when someone with a thick irish accent talks lol.
I can kinda understand what their saying
We can only stand jackaboy because of his time in GB
I can agree that Irish is the best accent, also sometimes I practice my Irish accent.
jack who is offended but not enough to be mad. this is why hes amazing
It was already hard for me to understand the British accent, to Irish accent I will need subtitles.
9:51 *Glory incarnate.*
Should try doing heavy Australian accents.
I lose my shit when Jack say im a vowel bender😂
3:20 drnk tomska
Petition for Sean to do a video entirely in Irish dialect without English subtitles- ..Only I wanna see that? nooneelse? just me, ok-
Sean, I freaking loved this video. Keep being you.
You sir, are not remotely anything like some of the mad accent lads.  I'm used to Newfies, which is our canadian version of irishman, and yeah... some those guys, I'm glad you DID translate lol
Try watching leather jacket guy
2:21 WHY DOES SEAN SOUND LIKE GRU BAHAHA
americans : no jack, his name is pronounced seen-mac-ant-sit-high
is it weird that the more I listen to the accent the more I can understand it?
i like when u said white... cause its sound like Hu-Wa-Et
*Shadowlands intensifies mostly since it is now officially released*
He sounds like anime people
"Give it a smack and go" beautiful line from Jack
Wtf is he saying
The fuck are you saying i dont speak taco bell.
Sean: I just say it mirrrrrrrrrrrrrrr (yes that is 15 r's) Me with a Utah accent: I don't say mounTIN like you people on the west coast, I just say moun'n.  Ik it's weird and this comment sucks go away
Walken trying to sound American sound weird.  Why does it seem like the south of any country has the hardest accents to understand?  Also, how do you rate Mrs. Doubtfire's accent (Robin Williams)
yknow i still think he's not actually irish
Off to watch the guide to Irish accents... Away!
Bruh that sheep guy is speaking other language
did anyone understand ANYTHING in this video?
Jse is true heart of Irish accents
Speaking of movies, when is the movie your in coming out Free guys?
IF IT COMES TO THAT ILL FREEZE MY EGGS
i miss meme time ;;
This was recorded November 10 and it said 11 hours ago
Does jack wear makeup for his eyes
Is that John Sharpson’s voice I hear in that last video?
What?
I have Irish ancestors but I have never actually been to Ireland. I've always wanted to go, The only one I really had a problem understanding was the sheep farmer. I can barely do an Irish accent without sounding like I was forcing it out and not being able to breath. But I do think it is a very interesting accent with how many different Dialects there are. Love your videos can't wait for the next one. :)
PAHTHAYTHERS!!!
Shower is the same for me as jacks “Mirror” “Sharrrrr”
Hey Sean just wondering where the bell went. It was all over the place in the beginning of quarantine and now it’s in the void of YouTube
So are we 100% sure that sheep farmer was speaking english? XD
Anyone want to talk about him pronouncing the H in herb
Jesus....the one with the 2 Irish rowers...it looked like the one wasn't even moving his mouth
Only thing I ever heard with that dude with the missing sheep was "beautiful morning" out of that entire video
jack, please go look at the cajun coach from the water boy movie. its based in louisiana
Everyone:  Farmer: *speaks Minecraft enchantment table in a cursive accent*
Sean makes me happy to be half irish. You can tell it’s real Irish if they say “that’s great crack” and don’t mean cocaine. Well they might mean cocaine sometimes.
this was hilarious and wholesome, i love your irish-related content
ㅤ
Jack is 50/50 irish british and understands the sheep guy accent. Callmekevin is almost 100% irish but doesnt understand 🤔🤔🤔
He can't understand them because he's not 100% Irish like Kevin.
Are we haring the same language holly shit
Irish kinda sounds Jamaican mix with smth else😂
I feel like there are thousands of dialects for each accent. But literally every accent has one dialect no one actually speaks but everyone uses when they don’t have that accent. That sounded a little weird but you get the point
I love how most English people are confused and jack is just laughing his butt off because he can understand it but also know how silly it sounds
I just enjoy hearing Seán have fun!
The end video was the best. Don’t cut that short....
why does jack translating for the farmer reminds me so much of the scene in bedtimes stories where he gets stung by a bee and has to get someone to translate for him
i can't help but keep repeating when that woman said "flour" after jack's guesses because it made it look as if she was correcting him in a very annoyed manner.
Oh gosh. The Irish accent a few octaves higher got me. I laughed harder than Sean.
Do more tabs please!!!
It’s sad that Christopher walken can’t do an Irish accent but Sean can do a better Christopher walken impression than Christopher walken himself 😂😂😂
The farmer is so easy to understand you aint irish if you dont understand lmao
Jeez you have grown alot since 2017 btw you saved me from boredom when u played sniper elite it was funny
Ehhhhh my favorite was the one that sounds like nogla
"try to say mirror in an irish accent, it's just M I and 15 r's
America has the sexist accents cause we have corps.
Are we sure it's just a thick accent because some of them sound drunk as fuck. Listen to them slurring their words together like crazy.
Tom Cruise has a pretty bad irish accent in Far and away, but its still one of my favorite movies
Lol don't smack a horse to make it run. It could kick your fucking jaw in without effort
A vlog of your return in Ireland would be great!
That was so fun to watch!
Hahaa sorry Sean but you do sound like that but way more in your old videos with your old intro being deliberately stereotypical people were bound to only think of that voice when they thought of you haha
Best Irish movie: the quit man
the point is they sound irish the drunker u get
How about try watching Peaky Blinders
Okay but now Sean has to listen Coach O from LSU so let’s see if he can understand a Cajun accent
The fact that I’m Limerick😂😂😂
I think you could have made this a one hour video and i would have watched it all. This was wholesome and funny for 20 minutes straight.
No Shaun.  You sound clear as Mac Ailello's Bell!
Please play Among Us with Irish gamers
Well Brad Pitt in Snatch isn't Irish, he's an English gypsy. Their accent isn't placeable on purpose. Little bit Irish, little bit English, little bit who the fuck knows.
Do Minecraft again it’s been so long
Sean, Sean, Sean, Sean , Sean!  Do a whole video with that beautiful Secsy Accent from the Land of Irish
When he’s repeating park and garden he looks so overjoyed
You, Terroriser and Nogla are the reason I say tree instead of three and trone instead of throne. I love it thank you. 😂❤️
Is it wrong that as an American with a couple of shots of rum I understand everything they said lol
You should look at Boondock Saints. It’s got Sean Patrick Flannery and Norman Reedus. They’re Irish twins living in Boston.
Why is one of his things I like ya cut g
8:50 is just Call Me Kevin
I’m 25% irish and I absolutely LOVE Ireland but I don’t have an Irish accent which makes me upset cause I love Irish accents TwT
My Partner is from Cork :') listening to these are nice since I can't hear his accent anymore O.O woops
RIP FACTS
Jack just says "Mirrrrrr" when saying "Mirror"?  Don't worry bud. I miss the ror too in Mirror.
I only caught a couple words from the guy who lost his sheep
the lass doing the vocal dohikies got me crying
Aha but watch brave 🥰
ahhh
I wish you would do an ASMR that doesn’t involve a bell....
You should react to the try channel
"Sexiest language" I'm sorry but who? Who voted ?
Just an observation, for the movie trailer. I just went "NOOOOOOOOOOO," because shame got me.
LOVE YOU JACKKKK!!!!
Lol Kevin couldn’t understand some of em either
When you can't even understand your own accent
Thicker the accent the more it sounds like they attempted to learn English but couldn't let go of speaking Gaelic
Jack - *tries out a Irish speaking vocal lesson Also Jack - I'm great at this! :)
Neat my assessors are from county cork! Cool to hear that!
Tbh, I used to watch his videos back in the day not knowing that understanding his accent would make me understand my best friend... . . . . Who is IRISH
After watching this video I feel like I can hardly speak right anymore. I'm from the state of Georgia, so I already have a southern accent going on, but after watching this I feel like the southern has increased and that has mixed with me unintentionally doing an Irish accent of some sort and it's weird. (Update: that didn't last very long but my was it an experience).  Like our man Sean has said, there are many dialects. Within' the American accent there's Southern, and within Southern there's Georgian, and within Georgian there's the ones in different cities, and I'm sure that can be divided up into more. I never really noticed different accents in my state before this one field trip in 8th grade that lasted maybe 2 or 3 days. Kids from different cities were at this one place with my school, and these kids from Atlanta said we (coastal Georgians) talked funny. We were really confused 'cause we thought they were the funny speakin' ones.  Anyways, I'd never think the Irish accent to be sexy. In general, I don't believe I've ever considered an accent to be sexy. I guess the closest an accent would be to sexy for me is Southern. As we established I'm Southern myself so I guess it's kinda weird to be attracted to accent in the same group as mine, but If you know me, you know I have a thing for cowboy men (I love them and wish to be one). McCree from Overwatch and Arthur from RDR2 yes pls. That's the only accent I think I can consider kinda sexy. I think a better word here would be attractive. I feel like I'd apply sexy only to voices, and even then I think of accents and voices on more on a coolness scale, which is basically how much I want the voice/accent for myself. Accents I find cool are , Irish, Scottish, and Australian in general since I can't name ones of specific areas in their respective countries.  (P.S. Sorry If this isn't understandable. I'm not very good with words.)
6:46 did he just said fortnite
4:28 yeah that might not make sense but ya know what makes more sense?         MORE COWBELL
You're a better Christopher walken than Christopher walken is an irishman.
The rowers sounded like CallMeKevin, I know Kevin is from cork too but it's funny to see it on the news
I like all Irish accents that I understand. I had an Irish lover. So, it irks me when a fake grates against my ears
Jack's accent was the best!!!
Weewwww I'm sweating trying to understand what some of these people are saying and Ive been to Ireland and I didn't have this much problem, wow.
Wow can’t believe that the majority of ppl who watch Jacks vids are subscribed its usually the opposite
I need a part 2 😂😂😂😂
I kinda wanna see Jack react to Craig Ferguson and Dara O'Brien. Just like there jokes. Even if ones Scottish
I moved to Ireland at 4 and it was the first accent of the English language I learnt.
Freaking fantastic... do some more
Kiss me, i'm Ireland
Sometimes if someone has a heavy southern-American accent you can’t understand a word they say.
Super irish accented people speak in a code that only irish people understand
Irish accents? wait a minute.. aren't you that guy that gave that anime girl from Doki Doki literature club Irish accent steroids?
I live in the southern part of central Florida and we had a neighbor whose country accent was so heavy and thick you couldn't understand a word he was saying. And that's saying something since almost everyone where I live has pretty decent-pretty heavy country accents. There's a point that some people reach where it's not speaking English with an accent, it's speaking a completely different language
I reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeally miss the, “top o the mornin to ya laddies!”
Just watch The Devil's Own
I really wanna know if Jack has seen young offenders 😂😂
Sheep Herders in Ireland have guns right? A good dog won’t fix people stealing your sheep but a good shotgun round in the air would be better. I sound like ur stereotypical American but I’m a liberal Californian. But that’s cattle restyling and a shot gun shell over the shoulder works a lot better than a dog you can feed steak too.... Ready for the criticism, hit me...
I want jack to do his best American accents
Wexfordman abroad and this made me both homesick and gave me the first good laugh of the week.
At that point its not a accent, it's a speech impediment.
Irish accent+Scottish accent+British accent = 😐😐😐😐
Hey jack um so I really like your vids and I've been watching you sense I was 5 years old now I'm 13
not a bad walken impersonation & btw i could understand  the farmer just fine
Wonder how sub teachers pronounce there names
they went with famous people form the county, limerick was one of the rubber bandits, and south dublin was ivor from damo and ivor
0:40 - 0:48 is when I liked. Jack/Sean if you are reading this, can you respond. Don’t have to though
I’m muther fuckin eenglishh
1mil likes in 20hours? yeah id call this video fun
I was gonna be upset if tom cruise wasn't atleast mentioned
Pls start talkin like this
Bro more than half the viewers are subbed that’s a lot better than most
It’s like they have their own separate English language that isn’t Gaelic!😂
I'm sick of how half the comments section is full of spammers, self promoters, trolls and bots on big youture's videos. YouTube should do something
Literally the most New York Irish accent ever
Irish English might as well be a different language
I wonder if us Americans are that hard to understand sometimes
Makes me miss Unus Annus a bit.
What about a Prince Edward Island accent? My girlfriend is from there and she refuses to admit that the Irish accent and the island accent sound similar
JAAAACK where is man eater?
Now that there is no evidence that unus annus ever existed Jack can Steel their video idea
Frost butt
This was ace, Sean. Thanks, mate. 💚
i didn't realise how much i loved irish accents until i started watching sean's channel, i find them absolutely delightful
ahh no New Zealand has the most sexiest accent just sayin no hate
I live 2 minutes away from where hot fuzz was filmed (wells, south west england) and i feel your pain when it comes to things like this. I moved here from south london at 4 years old (im 15 now) and that scene in hot fuzz you spoke about, is sooo right
I'm part irish but I can't speak irish so please don't make fun of me thanks wait I have something to say ( I'm part irish and shèan is irish so )
Seàn you should've ran for president
They speak cursive
Okay I'm Irish and even I can't understand half of what that guy who got his sheep stolen was saying.
NO. PILIPINOS HAB DA MOST SEKSIYEST AKKSENT EBER. PAYT ME JAK, P A Y T M. E
Jack again say SLAP TOP OF THE MORNIN TO YA *attept 5*
Yeah..  no fkn clue mate
irish noises intensifies
I fucken love this shit, I was just going over some accents the other day so this is convenient.
That man was not talking in english and you can't convince me otherwise
I'm Scottish and don't see the accent sexy at all. Even if it's third in the list  😂
I enjoy learning accents and I gotta say that I really liked the southern and northern Dublin, idk if its accurate but I enjoyed it lmao
I want to see a video of Sèan being as irish as possible
5:31 Wtf did he say I didn’t hear anything
3:13 All hail Jason Statham.
0:28 I am Italian, Scottish, and French..... What luck :)
When he said Brad Pitt, I immediately knew he was talking about snatch. And I knew he was going to bring up the caravan clip.
I could understand the farmer just barely
Wh3at has jacksepticeye become no top'o' the morning no outro
I have the same shirt 😍
He should react to Derry Girls!
I hate it when people say "Look at my Irish accent!" And then they make themselves sound like a Leprechaun.. (I'm from Northern Ireland)
The closest thing Irish is my cousin Shaun with the last name Fitzpatrick
Irish people: The only people that can say whatever the f**k they want on live TV, because most people don't understand their accent anyways.
better than a static voice nobody can hear that you have to yell to tell
Loved this video
I live in Pennsylvania US and we have a weird thing where we pronounce the a in water as if it were a u. so like we say "wuder" instead of "water" and I hate it
Nobody: Literally no one ever: Sean:hAhA eAt ShIt FrAnCe!!  0:26
Yeah children go to bed drink some phucking milk (I’m 13)
If you say isn’t it in an Irish accent it would be isn shit?
It  is  weird  to  think  that  one  island  a  fraction  the  size  could  have  as  many  varied  accents  as  the  entire  US.
FUCK JACK YOU CAN'T END ON A BANGER LIKE THAT, I CHOKED ON MY ROLL!!! XDDDD
Just try deciphering the accents when your on the verge of passing out
i find it easier to understand if you dont focus on the accent or the words to hard
Been bingeing seán for 2 years now
it sounded like the vocal coach said my nickname which is flare XDDDDD not flower
I will never understand why Hollywood doesn't just cast real Irish people for Irish characters...maybe it's because they're worried about the accent barrier.
I LOVE you Jack and your the king of Irishes ❤❤❤❤❤❤👌🐱‍👤
That Irish schoolboy looks like gman
Kevin did it first!
Is Charles Maguire an Irish name?
Don’t ever lose your accent. It’s one of my favorite parts of this channel :D
Don’t watch this high 💀
jack says the way he says "mirror" is funny but have you heard a midwesterner say it?🤣
im depression, at the part when he said "I don't say top of the mornin to ya" i rewinded to 0:00 to confirm and then i was sad that he actually doesn't say that anymore. Sean we honestly need you to say "Top of the morning to you" cuz 2020 is sad and depressing. pls :)
Jackie Jackie Fishy in the see A little Irish fishy Yes indeed
Actually in snatch, he's speaking with a english Belfast accent ☺️
I love the term leprechaun on acid
When that woman said "flour" like that, I legit thought it sounded like the Swedish Chef from the Muppets.
Heavy Appalachian accents feel close to this.   “It was airish out so I was figurin on goin inside but then I saw my toilet was sigoglin. So I went yonder down the road to tell those younguns to quit it”   No idea if it’s right, I’m not Appalachian
Brad Pitts irish traveller accent was spot on
We’ve been toppled, the scots have once again been taken by surprise by the Irish. But we’ll still make the joke that WE’RE BETTER THAN FRENCH
I don't know how the fuck they did it, but tjose 2016 Irish rowers sounded Norwegian.
omg the way she said flour TAHTS FRENCH NOT IRISH
It's even funnier watching this in one dollar ear buds
It ain’t possible some of these people are speaking English. Like what? Like the farmer all I could hear was farty fiveee....
ITS ME! MR. DUCK! I'M COMING TO KILL YOU...  -Christopher Walken, 2014 Congrats to anyone who gets this callback
...I feel like the people in the comments don’t get that as you’re around people with the same accent as you your accent gets more intense lmao
I'm watching this video at work and when it came to the part where she was pronouncing flower in an Irish accent I had to SLAP my mouth to prevent myself from laughing my ass off lmaooo I can't handle it
People can hate an Irish accent?  I didn't think that was possible...
Hey Jack, when are you gonna play that Demon's Souls remake?
Just me being able to understand all of them just fine lmao
brad pitt isnt doing an irish accent hes doing traveller fgs
Can you play more Minecraft
I think the really hard to understand one it so interesting xD i feel lile im solving a puzzle just tryna understand em
Geezus!!! The intor aiajsj
man's speaking a different language
I like old english laguage
Jack said get more milk, if your really Irish get more whiskey
I swear I thought the farmer was speaking russian
You guys have the same problem as Spain. Huge country with different accents everywhere, and some don't even speak Spanish the further north you go. You only realize it when you find that you need to watch a galician movie with subtitles 😂
I might be the only one, but I find a German accent appealing.
Ive watched your videos so long i dont notice your accent as much
The mirror pronunciation is true for southerners from the US as well. Where I'm from most people just say "mirrrrs."
When the Irish don’t want u to understand what they say they speak Gaelic adirnudjnwneksodps
So, Irish are to english what Chileans are to spanish.
This is just making me want to take a trip to Ireland after COVID so bad.
Sean saying he wants to travel back to Ireland and I immediately said afterwards without thinking, "you can take all of us on a fieldtrip", as if he could here me and as if taking thousands of different people on a group trip would be possible.
There must've been a ton of Irish people originally in my hometown because half my family sounds like the second shepherd and I'm from rural Mississippi 😂😂😂
It's not trouble to tell where Newfoundland gets a LOT of its dialect and slang! Love the similarities 🙌❤
The Irish accent is so much like the Newfie accent I can understand it. It’s too similar
These people talk and I'm just like, the FUCK?
Alt title: Jacksepticeye but his accent gradually gets thicker
I don’t carre
Everybody knows the most sexiest accent is the Indian accent
listen as he slowly becomes more Irish as he watches more videos
I would watch a whole video of Jack making fun of that entire Wild Mountain Thyme movie.
I'm French canadien and god I thought your accent was something but you know what! Your nothing compared to the sheep guy. I ddnt understand a thing...
Does anyone speak Irish, I can’t understand a single word jack is saying
Jack: Hit like on this video! Also Jack: Proceeds not to hit like on the video he's reacting to IRONY!
Id say one of the most unattractive accents i think ive ever heard is the stereotypical canadian accent im so glad i didnt develope one even though ive lived here my whole life
IT DOESNT EVEN SOUND-- ENGLISH I MEAN-- IT SOUNDS CHINESE LMAOO
John Wayne has a more believable accent as an Irishman in "The Quiet Man" than Christopher Walken, and John Wayne gave zero fucks when it came to even trying.
After living three months in Cork, I still don’t really understand what they’re saying
I REMEMBER THOSE ROWERS! THEY ARE VERY FUNNY!
Sean please play rdr 2 even if its only 1 video I would love to see you play it i know you would enjoy it :)
This video was great! Have fun more often!
Irish people don't say that Sean: "TOP O' THE MORNIN' TO YA!"
is weird that I can understand the Irish accent and I'm Irish ???? edit: well most of them lol
It’s crazy how diverse the Irish accent is
Irish accent makes English sound like when someone talks to you and you have just woken up
Try ondine jack
The phrase "Accent Hole" took me OUT
This was one of my favorite videos 🤭
I adore the Irish accent. Irish people are awesome
I can totally appreciate this type of thing. When you live in another country, listening to a whole lot of your own speak in "your" accent can ease a good bit of homesickness.
Sean: Hahaha no luck for you Scotland  Me: am I a joke to you
The *FECK* Jeff
“Eat Sh* France!” - Sean 2020
And this is right after watching 3 lads on a raft;)
this was golden
Jack: start drinking some more milk BITCH me: (drinking milk) BRO WTF
I am humbled and honoured...cause I'm Irish...but also a lil' insulted cause I'm Scottish...🤣
I like the last name of that Sean guy, just ignore 80% of the letters. ITS ALMOST A SILENT WORD
LMFAOO
no one can do northwest American accents. everyone always dose southern twang junk
IRISH
I understood most of the accents but the one that gave me the most trouble was the farmer. If Sean wasn't translating I wouldn't have understood him.   Still love the Irish Accent. It's beautiful and sexy!!
my grandfather has a hard accent when he gets mad he sounds like you sheep
Sean if you have a ps4 you can get  Destroy All  Humans 2 on the ps4
<——
after watching this vid im reading everyones coments in an irish accent lol
11:45 Sean’s “What’s... fler?”  😂😂😂
Can't believe my family came to America from famine only for me to have a shit Irish accent
I’m Irish and even I couldn’t fucking understand that farmers accent 😂😂culchie to the max
I've always wished I had a Scottish accent. sorry jack lol
My favorite part of the man's accent is when he says "fortnite" 6:46
So I just had a panic attack and the sound of his voice just cheered me up so much so thank you so much for being here me and us you mean so much to all of us
I absolutely adore content like this
Honestly, Sean, I don't even hear your accent anymore. You pronounce some words differently, but you mostly sound "normal" to me. Maybe I just got used to it
jack: START DRINKING MORE MILK  me: I drink 2 bags of milk everyday
I'm 75 percent French 5 percent native ameriacan and 20 percent irish
I'm a mutt and bcuz I am I slip into my diff accents alot, mostly me Irish and British and a bit Scottish. And I almost always text in my accents without know I bloody do it.
To those who are new, you can't really call Seán out on being racist since he himself is Irish
I really want you to judge Hasanabi's irish accent 😂😂😂😂😂
you should do a video on New Zealand accent and slang
his face around 10:45 bduwndhdv
The farmer’s accent almost sounds like he’s talking backwards
I want to know his opinion of the accents Norman Reedus and Sean Patrick Flannery did in Boondock Saints
Unrelated to the video id love to see you play danganronpa Edit: forgot to say that as always your videos are amazing
I should visit other countries... probably too late now...
I dont think the Dublin accents are thick but then I’m used to weird T sounds because of my very German grandmother lol
So when I started watching you I was 8 years old and now I’m 15 going on 16 in a few months but I almost started crying because I grew up on your videos and how I was thinking that your accent  used to be so damn strong
I used to think those rowers' accents would've been super strong until my roommate from Sligo had an equally intense (though obviously very different) accent, to the point I could always only ever understand the last word in the sentence. 'Shtory is certainly a greeting too.
"When the wild mountain thyme grows around the bloomin' heather, will you go lassie? Go"
“Go back to bed child, start drinking more milk BITCH” 😂
Yours the amazing, the jewel of Ireland is the best our of the videos you showed
My dad was in a play a while ago called The Seafarer, about an Irishman who makes a deal with the devil. The director, who also acted, as the devil, practiced the accent by saying "Up there for" as "oop dare far" and my whole family still makes fun of the awful accents used and it's been over 2 years.
is athlone interesting or maybe birr, kinsale, westport, dingle, kilarney, clifden, and louth.
I love to hate the accent, because i hate i love it.
I'm never actually heard Irish accent properly until now, it's really interesting
All i understood was sheep
Im a vowelbender killed me
Is anyone having Flashbacks to the 2 MEN 200 ACCENT video lol!?
Me an Italian: Yeah! Eat shit France!
Cork was hilarious in the last video 😂
"my lover" veering into Cornish there!
Me: Steven Hawkings Jack: No, Steven doesn't Walkings
Pre-Jackie translation:  Le me: The sheep herder said (I believe) "little over 30 head of them have gone missing it must have been in the early hours of the morn before the day was short".  Post Jackie translation: I have no idea how I heard any of what I heard. I sat there playing the same 30 seconds over and over trying to see if I could even stitch in a single bit of understanding of what he said but I give up now 🤣🤣🤣
I can get a little bit of what the farmer's saying.  Something about "Beau'ful mahrn" "bright oht" "up on the moan'tin" but that's all I got.
I'm from Scotland which obviously isn't too far away but I could barely understand most of these
Genuinely triggered that Jack didn't know who the rubberbandits are when he's talking about Limerick .
Ok this is great and all bois but I still don't know where tf Nogla got his accent from
yours
This video killed me I needed this I was so stressed from school lol jackaboy always makes me laugh
5:32 the farmer that lost his sheep kinda sounds like he's speaking backwards like how in gravity falls their is backwards messages
7:49 no jack your accent is not that thiccc it's a bit Irish, British, and American accents all added together but not an east or south American accent more like a New York accent.
It said 2020 but published in 2019? Lol...not ruining the fun just saying and also im not disagreeing, im just making sure you saw it..
I kind of want to see Jack play Danganronpa for some apparent reason
Every Irishman can be represented as one of the characters from Father Ted. Jack is the crazy old one who screams obscenities. Pretty sure his name was Father Jack, in fact...
Sean is getting some grey hairs there
That guy with the sheep is what most of my Norwegian family sounded to me as a child.  "Ihafthsaddamnarragawdabbagharandacrieagraggdedaisado!"  O_O ... **Smile and nod, smile and nod** "Uhh. _Yes_ uh, words. Mm. How 'bout that...daisado... hrm."
callmekevin 😂
Id dive down seáns Irish accent hole
I'm sure there's a person trembling on the ground while foaming by just watching this video getting more and more Irish
Proud to say I could understand 98% of the words spoken in this video! (Dropped a few words on the farmer though... that’s one strong ass accent)
I loved the cork accent. It sounds like a irish and scottish mix. Either that or I thought cork was a scottish accent all this time. Wow this comment ended up wayyyy to long.
ummm....am i the only one that realized that trailer was similar to the movie Survival of the Dead? it had the same names, the daughter had the horse...the dad was the same actor as the man on Survival of the Dead.....AM I THE ONLY ONE THAT MADE THIS CONNECTIONNNN!?!
dublin because.. katie mcgrath
Inconvenient of learning half your English from an Irishman and the other half from a lost Swedish swole boye as a Frenchman is that you end up sounding like s train wreck. Spent my whole highschool getting shit from my teacher for "forgetting Ts". Hell I don't even sound remotely close to sexy so it wasn't even worth it, but had a great laugh looking at Jack so it evens out
The accents are as bad as JACK PAUSING THE VIDEO EVERY 10 SECONDS! sorry just a joke... kinda
0:12 *I better start practicing.*
I really wish I could tell what my accent was like...
They just sound scottish to me... am I insane ? Edit: the ones that are bad at it
My Uncle had a friend who had a thick Irish accent and I always knew when he was over cause I'd walk in the house and just hear him babbling on in what almost sounded Gaelic lol I'd always get headaches trying to make heads or tails out of what he was saying. He would actually have to use an "American" accent for us to understand him half the time XD We would watch movies like "The Boondock Saints"(one of my all time favorites) and he would make fun of their Irish accents and repeat their lines how they should have sounded and it was always a good time because we would be drinking beer and whiskey lmao
0:45 jacks laugh
I'm from Cork (the county next to where the Irish farmer is from), and I still barely understand half of what he's saying. Kerry culchie accents are fuckin lethal, man.
I understood a fair amount. Hope one day to visit Cork, and Claire, my ancestors are from there and I actually still have some distant relatives that are there.
18:17 It was nice to hear Munteoir John in a JSE vid 😁
I do love Sean's accent. Plus what was that one guy saying?
You want another laugh look up Newfoundlanders accents. And gotta love all of them. So charming and delightful to the ear.
Accents are so fucking bizzare.
alternate: jack slowly turning irish again
i like the accent war between Scottish and Irish im Scottish
Aye jack try listening to Scottish accent. most folk struggle to understand us scots
After listening to this, Jack doesn't sound Irish to me anymore
hold on. he just said herb as HER-b. instead of pronouncing it erb.
I have my own experience with incomprehensible Irish accents.  I live near Newry, which is the closest city to the Northern/Republic border. So you have the Ulster Brogue from some people in the city or those who come down to Newry to do some shopping since it has 2 shopping centres... or those from across or near the border who have the thickest fucking accents.  I did a work entry course via the Clanrye Group (wonderful people who run the course and they got me into work) and the bus driver was from across the border and sounded just like a Hollywood leprechaun. Also did a work experience in a shop in town and had to day that I couldn't understand a farmer due to how thick his accent was.
Tbh, I never understand Irish accent. I never get how they were different. Ever since I saw Jack, I never knew Irish accent. I just enjoy how he screams and have fun.
How the hell was Australia ranked number 5? Our accent isn't sexy. It sounds like a log going through a wood-chipper.
Has anyone noticed that hes wearing makeup
You should play new game + in miles morales spider man
Oh, to live in a country where the worst thing that happens are farty-five sheep go missin'
he missed Northern Irish places
Tbh, I speak a little Irish... ON ACCIDENT!!!! Sometimes I will talk and then it just...happens.......
I understood the rowers.. that was about it haha.  This is great!
I miss ur old intro
But I thought New Zealand got sexiest accent in the world?
These are not really that hard to understand that or I’m to used to it XD
That fecking kerry man is a legend. Any Irish person that tries to show someone outside of Ireland a thick Irish accent, shows them that video
Flare wat is she saying?
Sean have yu seen the movie Luck of the Irish. It was a Disney movie that was released in the 2000s Would love to see you react to that movie
When the Limerick guy with the bag on his head showed up all I could think of was The Rubberbandits - I've a Horse Outside 😂😂😂😂
Remember the game tabs well now it has a beta unit creator 🎉🎉🎉🎉 WOOOOOOO GO TABS🎉🎉🎉 ahem anyways have a good day 👍
I suggest that you watch this with subtitles they are funny
There is a movie of Irish people and their accents are pretty strong the movie is called "the siege of Jadotville"
And there is a lot of memes from those bad Irish accents videos
Tell me that that schoolboy did not look like the grinch
thats last vid i could tell where Daithi, Kevin and the rest of the lads were from
I can understand everything they are saying that’s the pros of being from Devon, you understand every accent in the uk and Ireland
Christopher Walken trying to be Irish reminds me of Sean Connery trying to do any accent other than his own.
Sean im canadian and a little Irish and I understand
Omg the Irish news just remind me of NZ news
18:23 - 18:38 lmao 😂
I’m Irish and live in Ireland and I can barely do the accent myself 😂
I think jacks accent gets stronger the further you go into his old videos 😂 it’s an amazing accent tho 👍
In my opinion jack's accent is the most interesting. I can do other accents but jack's is just different😳
I feel like I'm just having a brain fart trying to comprehend what they're saying
I needed this video more than I thought lmfao
Jack is milk gang
Unnus annus tho 😂😂
oi you know there has been a major update in plague inc.?
When someome changes their accent it sounds like crap
Thanks to Sean I can pick out an Irish accent and a Scottish one lol I can actually tell the difference I work at a hotel as a night auditor and one night had to call for help from the systems helpline and the person who helped me I could tell he had an Irish accent and I asked him and he said yeah he's from county Cork and I was like well I know where that is actually lol just thought it was funny. On a side note as soon as I asked him if he was Irish his accent got so much thicker it was like he was trying to calm it down and not sound Irish and more American it was music to my ears
This makes me feel like a South Park episode. Jack casually translates my English language but heavy accented that I can't understand. Wew
11:53 Kinda sounds like Flare. I’m not offending anyone I have a bit of Irish in my bloodline. In fact my hair changes from blonde to a bit of strawberry blonde in some lighting and that’s how you can tell I have a bit of Irish.
bruh, aussie ascents are the best, aussie aussie aussie oi oi oi
Um Jamie the guy that was in 50 shades of grey is Irish
I could understand very little but I think thick Irish accents sound beautiful.
Now I'll call Sean - Sean Mac N Cheese
This just reminds me of people asking (What's a dialect?) Me being like Σ( ° △ °|||)︴boi....
Loud noises are my kind of humour
My favorite accent...still Jackibois
I can’t understand jack, uh does anybody have subtitles
0:40 my favorite line from Jack

Next time you should review Irish people in movies, like Waking Ned Devine. I loved that movie when I first saw it about a decade ago.
I need more of this
19:10 I wasn’t looking at my phone during it the first time but I heard this dude talk and I quickly shot down to look at my phone cuz I thought that was Terroriser for a second 😆
The Irish accent has to be my favorite accent in the entire world
That was brilliant!
react to derry girls!!! it takes place in Northern Ireland and it's during the Troubles the accent? thicc the slang? somehow I, a Canadian, can understand it hotel? trivago
I love this video
Is it just me, or did the reporter kind of sound like RT
Anti:You stupid,jack Jack:ITS OPPISITE DAY,ANTI!!!!SO,YOU STUPID,YOU SMALL STUPID BRAIN!!!!
This video should be retitled to Irishman Makes Fun of Other Irishmen's Accents.
WE NEED HIM TO DO AN AMERICAN ACCENT
Being from South Dublin I love hearing ppl try my accent, but yer one from the first movie had me in tears
Bruh turned flower into flrrr
I wonder what you think of Cassidy's Irish accent for Preacher.
the accents that no one can understand sound like another language
Wait... if IRISH people don't say "Top o' the Mornin'," then where DID that phrase come from?
I remember you didn't have an accent on your first video
"I'm a VoWEl BenDeR" pure gold
It was like every five words the farmer would say two or three in english then switch back
this is great
True,I live in a state that has so many different accents
This video reminds me of the fact that in King of the Hill, nobody can understand what Boomhaur says unless they are from Arlen Texas.
Australia: 5th on sexy accent poll   *sexy Aussie noises*
Wait what would happen if you gave Corpse a Irish accent
Jack,1:whats ur real name?2:are the EGOS alright,how r they doing?3:WHERE IS ANTISEPTICEYE?!?!
Callmekevin also did one of vids like these. Jack and Kevin should do one together, and just have absolutely no idea what their own countrymen are saying together
This video made me feel great about being Irish and Sean didn't even talk about where I'm from. (Cavan)
I can't believe i actually understand some of these videos especially the in the sheep one and im nit even Irish  im 🇵🇭
hahaha you literally read my mind, I was looking at Irish accent videos the other day and wanted to watch you react to them.
for a second 5:06 reminded me of that subtitled seal video sfkghdf
I would absolutely watch a series of you just reacting to various Irish accents. I loved this!
I WHEEEEZED at 19:10
Jack has the power of the ultimate irish accent
I love that Jack has already watched the news report and that leaves the question, how many times has he watched it?  Also as an Australian I am very confused how we ranked 5 on the sexiest accent of 2019... You have heard us right?
with the mid english-irish accent sean has id really love him to be in pirates of the carribean now
B R U H . That farmer sounds like he's trying speak russian.
This made me smile the entire video without realizing
Why are the sheep have pink and blue on their fur?
He's speaking the language of the Gods.
Me:what the heck is that farmer saying (im filipino)
I honestly thought the sheep herder was speaking Gaelic for a minute there. Whooo, that was heavy.
"people that try to do an Irish accent that don't have an Irish accent and it sounds absolutely terrible" Now u know how us Aussies feel
10:37 *confused  Irish noises*
:O we have the same shirt! :)
Oh that was so fun!
I thought Brad Pitt's accent was not pure irish, they were travellers, like roma travellers. 🤔
I really wanna know if Scotland and Ireland ppl get along
I vote for JACKIEBOY!!
Are you wearing eyeshadow?
We needed this today
when he said he had a rock tied to his neck, he sounded russian
Australians were abouts to send their whole army of... Wombats, Kookaburras, possums, Cockatoos, Black Cockatoos, Short-beaked echidnas, Dingos, Tasmanian Devils, Tasmanian Tigers, Wallabys, The Cane Toad (I dont even know what that is), Emus, Goannas, Taipan Snakes, Death Adders, Playtypus', and Kangaroos after you, if you said  "Get fucked Australia!"
My fave accent is cork and kerry can u tell what Kerry's saying jack?
When I visited the Aran islands, an old farmer spoke to me exactly like this and I didn't have a clue what he was saying - I felt so rude! To be fair, he was probably just taking the piss and making fun of the tourist
😂😂I’m fookin great at this
Ever planning on continuing outer wilds?
I'm on my phone right so i left my tv on YouTube and let it auto play and i was listening to music. Then i see this video so i clicked it. 5 minutes in i look over at my tv and see the exact same video exactly 1 minutes behind the one i clicked on my phone. That's a wild coincidence i wanted to share.
Damn, I have an Irish mate that talks like this but he is slightly more intelligible. But beh jehzus ya canne undershande whet he is seyin haph ‘he thyme.
Random things like this just makes Sean's video even better!😂😂
I'm glad we can understand you XD
The best part of this video is how much you enjoyed yourself. Really great to see, had a lot of fun watching.
The only words I understood was Moonlight and... crap I forgot the other part but I understood those two parts alone. I had no idea there was this many almost as much as we have different individual accidents in the United States as they do in Ireland.
What about Glaswegian. You should see if you can understand Glaswegian dialect.
Jack! I'm getting a Sun conure soon and I wanted to ask if you have any name suggestions for her!!
Just found out I'm 43% Irish...
When Christopher is angry with that Accent he sounds Scottish
Greatest irish accent in my opinion is still Jacks
I want jack to play slime rancher again they added more stuff to do
Forget about CORPSE's voice. I totally simp for Jack's irish accent and energy
Speaking of Hot Fuzz you should try and understand some of my friends from the west country where I am. I’d love to see your impression of the west country accent. Thick Somerset accent
If you're so irish why don't you drink irn bru      ;)
Get effed Italy ?? Thems fighting words
Forget irish acceint he was speaking irish language
I'm brazilian, for me it's already hard to understand jacksepticeye talking, but this guy right here 06:17, I can't understand anything he's saying omg.
I always feel like I have a “default accent” which does NOT feel interesting at ANY times  Apparently I also say mirror in an Irish accent, but everything else is American-
Jokes on you I drink lots of milk
Where are you from
I'm Irish Australian and I have been to Republic of Ireland for a week on my 27th birthday guess that makes me a sexy Irishman downunder
*Don't get Irish mixed with Scottish*
That dude at 8:11 looks like the G-man XD
Idk if anyone else could basically understand every word that was said but I could it sounded like my home when I was younger growing up with Irish grandparents and great grandparents it didn't help they would talk fast
These arent Irish accent they're Irish speech impediments
Brad Pitt wasn't playing an irishman, he was playing a romani
The sheep farmer sounds like he's speaking Simlish
My question is...what is the Tipperary accent? That’s where I want to move to one day, so I’m just curious
Review more accents, I like it very much. Is so stereotypical, in a funny way, I love to hear foreign accents
Irish accents are just pirate talk.
At least Jamie Dornan is actually Irish
I dream of going to Ireland someday
GOSH I love accents and linguistics SFM! I think sheep dude's was my favorite because it's practically evolved into a whole new language and that is AWESOME because that's how dialects and languages work! Even in a relatively small country! Give North America a few hundred more years and the distinctions between the accents we've already developed will have become this strong, too! Completely without conscious intent! It's so cool!!
2 mins i dont care reminds me of disneys brave
wtf why are strayan accents 5th sexiest?
I like the background music!! nice little tune!
My uncle is Irish and when he talks Irish it is the best
jack yes agree IRISH people are something else but man you all make me laugh my butt off love the IRISH people there awesome
Is it weird to say that I've actually met farmers that also sound like the sheep guy? But minus the Irish accent.  I guess it's just universal that country folk have heavy accents.
my granny knows the fella on the news that had his sheep stolen, was hilarious watching it on the news
I tried doing Scottish, but ends up doing a Northern Irish Accent similar to either Michael Smiley or Ciaran McMenàmin
Hey I'm watching this on 25th November 2020 from India, tamil nadu and we are having a cyclone in 12 pm india time November 25th and the onlybthing that can calm me down is jacksepticeye vids ❤️ u jse .
Can you play more flash games pls
australia is florida, ireland is texas, and England is california
Yeah... s'like people assume that a "Canadian accent" is just Bob and Doug for days. ... Which would be more like a Newfie accent. Whereas someone from BC (like me) sounds NOTHING like that. lol
as someone who talks spanish and is learning english, i can't understand anything
I honestly think that Seán’s accent isn't that hard to understand. (but I have been watching his videos for 5 1/2 years at this point, so maybe I'm just used to it.)
I liked this video. More accent videos please
Whale oil beef hooked. :D
OMG I'm sooooo excited for Christmas because I'm getting Top Of The Mornin hot chocolate!! 😀😊☺
Jack translating that Irish guy is amazing.
Hey jack I have been watching your videos since you had 20 subscribers and watching you’re videos is the only source of happiness in my life, thank you for making videos.
Where should I go when I go to ireland
Jack hiveswap act 2 tomorrow are you gonna play it
I'm no understand Jack's Watching Other Language
i was born and raised in America but my grandparents are both from Ireland and this video opened my Irish third eye
So Irish accents for me is depending the tones or the words are smooshed together
I"M AWAKE NOW
I'm cringing and i'm not even Irish.
No one: Absolutely no one: People living in ireland when they ask a teacher to go to the toilet: An bhfuil cead agam dul go dti an leithreas?
The irish accent is intresting but talk too fast and i'll be a sheep and sorry if offensive.
The farmer and Jack, is like Badman and Little Jacob.
I can always count on him to make me laugh
Well, to be honest, you don't really have a stereotypical irish accent anyway, and your accent has probably changed a bit sense you don't live in Ireland anymore.
React to Norman Reedus’ Irish accent in Boondock Saints!
Yo wan wasint bledin irish
those damn yanks again
ayyy the sheep said trans rights!
There is only black in this video
I think I m you but jack        Wtf did I just say
11:53 SHE REALLY SAID fłęër 🧍🏽‍♀️  also sean’s smile and laughs fulfilled my daily serotonin boost for today
When he siad you cant understand they people with strong accents but I understand 90% of it
Does anyone know if Sean is a northern Irish or southern Irish person
10:26 nice pause seán,     Also, edit, the part where your accent shines the most is any word that has *wh* at the start, you pronounce it *hw* like, for you whale would be hwale
Ya skipped right as he was about to talk about northern Ireland fuckin balloon
I died when Sean said "keep it in the blindfold Jeff"
This is so funny 'cause I am vurrently learning an Irish accent and most of the videos that Seán watched like the sheep, the schoolboy and the tutorial are the videos I only recently watched 😂    You okay? 🤷‍♂
I’m from Newfoundland and you don’t have a heavy accent.... you sound Like you could be from Newfoundland. But not everyone has a strong accent here but me and you speak kind of the same. And I’m only 12 so yeah ❤️
I can't get over the fact that in Ireland the political parties differ on how much they hate England and that Scottish citizens and Irish citizens have an on going battle of who hates England more xD
Brad Pitt in snatch isn’t supposed to be Irish, he’s a gypsy, it’s somewhere in between English and Irish, and it’s pretty accurate to those I’ve met
as a fellow Irish woman I absolutely love these Irish videos, rippen that you didn't show Fermanagh accent where I'm from, awk but sure here, ye cant have everything
It all sounds Irish to me
#43 on Trending    Nice Jacksepticman
these accents are just the best. man i love the irish culture edit: as Gordon Ramsey would say: oil
New quote of 2020 "what the fuck jeff"
People love there leprechauns
My favorite college professor was from Ireland and when she got excited about a topic her accent got thicker....it took me a while but I eventually could keep up with her.
this is how I feel watching Fargo
Fuck dude, Irish is a separate language and I refuse to learn it.
How the hell douse he understand i know he's irish but damn and if i dindt spell something right its becouse im dutch and young
JUST AS HE WAS ABOUT TO DO THE NORTHERN IRISH ACCENT YA STOPPED IT! WHY DO YOU DO THIS EVERY TIME SEAN!?!?!? do us northern irish not matter? :(
I like that Seán’s impression of an American doing an impression of an Irish person, ends up sounding like a Schwarzenegger impression in itself! 2:25
The Irish farmer with the sheep man- I’m usually good with accents but holy shite
I miss the "top of da mornin'" intro
These types of videos are the best 😅😅
him saying that irish accents are hard i be like ever went to barbados
Lol, in the thumbnail you can see Sean's background between his head and the headphones.
i understood some of the accents, surprisingly 𓆉
The like and dislike ratio on that trailer though, probably a lot of angry Irish people mad at the casting choices lol I'm not hating, I just find it funny
I've lived in Ireland for the past 24 years and even I cringed at some of those videos.
Sean translating the sheep farmers accent made my day.
Cork has a strong accent. Except if you're Kevin, who is also from Cork.
hi jack love this video. i am from tullamore co offaly.
I'm so proud, Australia is top five and of course nothing could top irish accents but im still so happy.
ooh “flower flare”
Dude talking about his missing sheep Me: I like your funny words magic man
Why do they sound constantly drunk😂
also here in indonesia we have hundreds languages, and each leanguages has many accents
When the woman said "add the i to the word ireland" and jack said ireland i literally started crying out of laughter. He doesnt notice is like "oireland" for him
kinda wish he included some north accents
Whale oil beef hooked!
God, i was hoping to see some farmer michale in this.
These accents are making me believe I don’t know how to speak English 😂 it sounds like a completely different language and I have no idea what anyone’s saying 😂😂
That video was wonderful.
Some people say Sean’s accent must be fake and that he doesn’t even sound Irish, after watching this video I’m more confident then ever that his accent must be perfectly feasible if these fucking people are walking around talking like this.
Nowadays the only movie i can think of when I think about actors doing fake Irish accents is Boondock Saints. Not the best accent work in the world but at least they were consistent. Sean Patrick Flannery's isn't too bad, and I definitely think it comes across sexier, which maybe that's a heritage thing, but Norman Reedus' makes me giggle uncontrollably every time I rewatch it, his is so cheesy
This is heavier than a kilogram of feathers
Not gonna lie, I really like the Cork accent. Even if it's the stereotypical one people are usually thinking of when they think "Irish accent".
There are supposedly different accents but we only see and hear one common one for all. Same with British, Australian, etc.
I loved this video plz do more videos like it
I'm cringed in position
You need to listen to the Irish Rovers. The Star of the County Down is my favorite tune.
anyone else have their subtitles on? 🤣
Come back! We miss our mascot!
This is the actual content I like
2:23!! Anyone else hear Gru from despicable me??
Séan please do a northern accent PLEASE or attempt it if u want :)
"Farty-five"
This was really fun just listenin to ya Jack XD The irish vids are always tha bessst! And it's even more fun cause you're have'n a blast of a time!   *totally not slightly pretending i'm typing in an irish accent lol* tell me i did good~!
Sean say 333,333 tree's 🌳🌳
Mr Jackscepticye ,sorry I don’t no how to spell that, my name is Luke Robke I have anxiety autism adhd depression and shortness of breath I’m having a hard time ive had to go to hospital school but u have kept me happy I really wanted to meet u if u get the chance pls give me some words of encouragement ur my hero mr jackscepticye thank u so much🙂
Brad Pitts character wasn't Irish though. I forget what they are called but it explains it in the movie there jackaboi
You know it’s a strong accent when another Irish man says so
When they said "I don't care" I immediately had flashbacks to Happy Wheels.
I’m Irish and I done even understand that oul farmer
Hey jacksepticeye, here's a fun fact, blum house has a script for the fnaf movie, and they film it next year during the spring
how in the ... did they lose to Spanish, that is what I thought was the sexiest accent. interesting.
2:26 Sean be sounding like Lars Ulrich
can you pls play teardown?
I grew up around thick English, Scottish, Irish,  accents pretty much any accent u can think of we get all kinds here in Wellington, New Zealand, so I have always been able to understand thick accents, and I'm the one in the friends group that has to translate lol
I want to learn how to do an Irish accent. Irish accents sound so cool. <3 to all and all good well.
I always like when Sean gets really irish.
I’m 3rd generation Australian on both sides of the family but my great great grandfather is from County Mayo. This is not relevant at all but I felt the need to prove my slight percentage of Irish DNA.   ...  Carry on.
Period films with Irish characters: English actors Period films with American characters: English actors ....they do realize that you can hire actors from the actual countries, right?
That farmer and I do not speak the same language
u should do 23 n me test see wich bloodline u from
i think around waterford was the best accent when i visited
I feel like this is changing my whole conception of my american accent. I can barely speak this hurts me.
The “How to do an Irish Accent” video is more of a generic Irish accent for the stage.
Had to turn the subtitles on... That's how hard is to understand for me 😅
i wood like to play among us with u
I watched that woman's video to learn an Irish accent
Now you know how I feel about "Asian accent". Which is laughable at best offensive at worst.
Jack: *Laughs*  Me: What the f*ck did they say?
Can we get a whole video with sean just speaking in irish accent, (pls provide subtitles) cuz that would be funksjsks
Sean make a video where you talk in an American accent
I’m very fascinated by other cultures and places, and I love hearing Jack talk about Ireland! Jack could make a ten hour podcast about the history of Ireland and I’d immediately listen to it. It’s so amazing to hear about different places and learn about their cultures.
The start of this video went from 0-100 real quick. And if u don’t like that   U can go drink milk bitch 😂
After hearing all the accents, I like Sean's the best.
Accents are great, its either you understand them or you donr.  I just realized my country’s accent is so much lower in the list than i thought. (Philippines) I actually didnt even know we had an accent.
Seans accent got thicker and thicker as the video went on 😂😂
Now that you are saying you b us don't have very much political debate on the news I want to live over in Ireland with you jack
Love your accent🤩. Also love Aoife from Eurogamers (Derry) accent😍.  She also taught me wain is not equal to Wayne😅
Puts up image of subscribed vs not subscribed  Me: yeah that just seems to always be how it is. normally about half the people that watch content dont subscribe
He did not mention missing a few ewes...
whenever jack listen to an Irish accent his accent gets thicker its great
damn that guys name is really shawn mctitty?
Jack's accent is like Hollywood Sean; it's cleaned up for a larger audience. Now when Jackaboy is speaking with a fellow Irishman or even watching other Irish people speak, Sean emerges. His accent goes full pot-o-gold within 10 mins.
the amount of serotonin this video gave me
HOW DID. HOW DID HE TRANSLATE THAT IRISH SHEEP MAN. I'M SO. WOAH.
Jack's so defensive of the Irish accent cause of the whole "sexiest accent" thing....but as a Kiwi, I must remind you that in 2019 our accent was voted the sexiest in the world...and it is ANYTHING but 😂
I am part Irish and I can understand some of the accents but because I was born in Australia my accent stops me from doing an Irish one
you don’t even sounds like you’ve got an accent 😂
I once had a Irish bus driver.
You mentioned in a different video the Vermont accent and I'd bet good money on our accent being a hard mix of Scottish/Irish and Dutch with a side of French Canadian. I feel like accents that are that noticeably shifted are hard to do without growing up there. (Vermonters also hate T's at the end of words for no reason lololol). Accents are fun and this video was cool to see you going through what made sense and didn't to you. :)
I can’t fucking recognize Irish accents wtf For me english is all the same shit except for the britannic accent
good translating I will be honest I had no idea what he said
We really need the old intro and outro back
The equivalent of a thicccc American accent is a Louisianan accent (not New Orleans city but like in bayou)
You should roast our accents
As a non native speaker I did find the Irish  (Cork and Galway) easier to understand than the Scottish (Edinburgh, Glasgow and Inverness)
He said herb weirdly
Jacks was the best accent
im convinced that mikey fella was switching between Irish and English
What the fuck was the ad I got before this video though
I’m English, born and raised here but both my grandad on my mum’s side and my nan on my dad’s side were born and lived in Ireland for their whole childhoods. Both from Tipperary and it took me 17 years to realise that they actually do have accents 😂 everyone in the family understands what they say, but everyone else who meets them has no idea what on Earth is going on
Sean you should play Silksong when it comes out. Ooh or you could play Hollow Knight before Silksong comes out.
0:56 Jamie Dornan's Irish lol
Are the corners of Sean's eyes discoloured, or is he wearing eye shadow? Not judging, just curious if it's a trick of the camera etc.
Its my first place i want to travel to Dublin, Ireland
I remember when Call Me Kevin showed the farmer on his Irish News video. Good times.
Jack some good USA accents to look up  Wisconsin Louisiana creole New York Mississippi California
MORE OF THIS PLEASE!!!!
Im used to your accent cuz ive been watching so long, but when you play games with your other irish friends it comes out strong😂
JACK! Felix ask you where did you get  the axe
The last video was my primary school teacher
It's so funny that Sean did this video on the same day that Cody ko tried to do an Iris accident
Hey Jack did you make another account under Richie gamer? If not, they are posting your streams on that channel.
Your accent is so strong that you yourself can't even understand what you're saying anymore.
as an englishman, i can confirm, she sounds english,  fake irish confirmed
WOOO limerick 😂
Scotland here were offended
Irish, Scottish and some southern accents are some the hardest to understand. I think the more rual you get the thicker the accent
the difference between Kevin and Jack translating the Irish farmer is hilarious, kevins like, ". . . . ehhhhhh" while Jacks just "Yea the moon was out and anyone could have stolen the sheep, just like the farmer said"
Alternate title: Sean being very proud that hes irish for 21 minutes straight
Sean Mac an tsithigh Mac an t  sith   high   Sith   High Ground
You know what? Everyone should start drinking more milk. Milk is tasty and good for the bones. Lactose intolerant people are outta lick.
Hey Sean you should take a holiday back to Ireland an do a vlog about the different cities you travel to
It looked like jack had eye liner on did anyone else notice?
Brad pitts one was more cultchie like  norn iron cultchie
Sean’s titles are starting to look like titles on tuber simulator
Lol I learned something today (that I should have already known) as SOON as one video he was watching talked about Limerick I was like OMG the Rubberbandits! Then obv realized the little dude with the mask was him and realized I dont watch enough music videos 😂
and not a single mention of Niall horan 🥰
Heck, Taliesin Jaffy and Matt Merccer can do better accents that these actors.   I think. or as jack has recommended -Higher Irish actors.  Fluent Forever is a good reference website for American actors, via recommended by Matthew Mercer.
haha mirrrrrrrrrrrrrrr go wee
this was a great vid, honestly just good fun
Captions may have been a thing
can this have a part 2? it was so fun!
Sean Mac an tSithigh is a legend.
oof- im part irish but i dont have an accent  XD
When a person starts speaking with a Irish accent: Neuron Activation
All I hear is jock and Conner with the cork lads
I'm American (Midwest). I think I've gotten a lot better about this, but I'll still talk so fast and low and murmuring sometimes that people will have no idea what I'm saying. After seeing that bit with the farmer, I'm like, "OK, so great-grandpa must have come from the South, and that's where I get it from." [After thinking about this for a minute, I remembered that everyone with our family name and its variants are from the Southeast.]
God I loves me country 🤙🏻💚💚
Rt and Terroriser are northern dublin Daithi limerick Kevin Cork
You should check out Rubber Bandits! Especially the song Roisin
As a Canadian, if theres one thing I understand it's "frostbutt"
I have a friend from Galway who taught me about the notoriety of Limerick  Also I can empathize with you on feeling alone from being away from where you love. I was an exchange student in Japan for a year, and while I felt alone in my thoughts not being able to communicate, once I broke that barrier and could speak more freely, I felt more free than I ever have. I loved speaking the language and figuring things out whenever I was stuck on a word, and being able to rebuild myself where no one knew me was a liberating experience.  I truly loved being there, and being back home brought back the same pressure and depression I always lived with before. I'll be going back after College, but it's a hard feeling to work with.
I may not have an accent, but I am over 90% Irish and my uncle used to babysit you when you were younger.
It's weird how as soon as Jack translated, my brain was like, "Yeah, obviously! You can clearly hear those words now!" As if it hadn't just told me "He said, 'SHEEP ajfskjfbwijfbw.'"
I made the mistake of showing my 73 year old Irish ☘️ mother this video, now I have to watch it again and again because she loves it. 🍀 🍀
When ur so irish that the irish cant tell what ur irish says
6:04 my man sounds german
I can understand some of the dudes words
You should get drunk on the channel jack
i am from kerry and i was so scared you weren't going to say anything about that CLEARLY british person
Fourty-five sheep 🐑🐑🐑
11:44 I spit out mt cash dang soup
I thought filipino accent was the Most sexiest XD
Seàn : Eat shit France!  Me (who is a little bit French) : *knowing it’s a joke but also thinking a small part isn’t* Because you are one of my four, #1 spot favorite YouTuber, I’ll let it slide.
I found that milk insult very offensive.  I hear it enough from the people of Skyrim, I don't need to hear it from you.
My ancestors are from Ireland and France but Here I am a typical boring American. Lol
FARTy five is a lot!
They call me lucky charms because i am magically delicious
00:35 no joke took me 3 times of playing it to figure out what he said here XD
In Cork City and surrounding areas alone there's at least 8 differnet accents ranging from the snobby shites (looking at YOU Douglas and Bishopstown!) to the absolute moshpit that is the North side which is a mash up of the typical Traveler slang and the word "like" is attached to every sentence at least once or twice. Great craic. And the further out you go you'd be lucky to understand a sentence being spoken XD.  Edit: And don't get me started on the number of accents in Dublin! I'd be here all day trying to describe that! 🤣
did you guys notice how many WHITE HAIRS jack HAS?!
How can you make this video without reacting to the man with the single strongest accent known to mankind? The man's name is Sham and he's from Killarney. Watch it.....................and L A U G H
Can we get more movies with Saoirse Ronan getting to use her actual accent? She easily could've been in Wild Mountain Thyme...
Unus Annus viewers: I understood that reference
I'd love to see your reaction to the Newfoundland accent. It has a heavy Irish influence (obviously not as thick) and it's completely different to a typical Canadian accent
Jack following that accent tutorial was like me following an English tutorial.
oddly enough i can kind of get the strong Irish accents, i don't however understand the slang
the captions just give up when angry irish farmer talks
Sean: no luck scotland Me: cries In kilt
Newfie accent is just the Irish accent but Canadian
400 dislikes exactly? well frick the 400 that did dislike
I watched this solely to finally find out what the fuck was being said in that video.
The lady from county cork sounded like she was going to kill them
Jack! When covid ends and when you go back to Ireland with your gf, can you go  with Felix and Marzia?
John 3.16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. Romans 6.23 For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Romans 10:9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.
The thing with the how to do an Irish accent video is that it’s a good starting point if you started with that then continue to practice and speak faster with more confidence you will develop something different and more natural
6:07 i don't care what anyone says, this isn't English
Next he's moving onto Scottish and English lmao
19:47 a Rubberbandits reference 😃
Jack's Christopher Walken impression is much better than Christopher Walken's Irish accent. Lol.
0.1 seconds after that old man started talking: yeah no i dont speak latin dude.
Irish man does Irish accent    *"man im great at this"*
Nice
This reminds me of my business partner, but he doesn't have an accent he is just an idiot. Don't like his videos please.
i was cringing the whole fucken time
Jack. Now you know how we feel about Tom Holland’s American accent in Spider-Man. Like it sounds American, but it just isnt *right*
Ireland is kinda like Dalmatia, THICC accent, schools closing on 1mm of snow and alchohol drinking madlads. The main diffrence is that Dalmatians are dark toned and freeze on 16C
Fun fact lads my uncle used to be the manager of The down Gaelic team lads
I love a good Donegal accent! But Cork takes a close second!
11:35 you seem legitimately happy you can do an irish "accent" and it's adorable
I low-key wanted Jack to listen Becky Lynch's irish accent
"Every county, every village has a different accent" So what you're saying is, Irish accents are just about like Southern American accents (I swear to God that farmer sounded like Creole)
This reminds me of people trying to do an Australian, whenever i hear people imitate one it always sounds british which isn't what we sound like lol.
12:22 its the same with regions in America and British people can't tell the difference!! its crazy
I am Polish and I live in West of Ireland since I was one years of age and I have a decent accent meself💪🏼😃
I'm part Irish. 👌
Aye jackseptikeye lol
I like ur accent the best just sayin
My personal opinion, I still like Jack's the best
Hey jack, I’m a teacher and if you dress up as a leprechaun and start speaking in a thick Irish accent and I’ll make my class subscribe to you for homework, also if possible say “ you need to burn things”, most people won’t get it but I’ll give you all a clue, Ralph wiggum
Bring back sims 4
The starts so aggressive 😭😭😂😂
Al take 3rd
My grandma has an insane deep German accent and I can barely understand her sometimes
everyone: Irish = loud
Ah jasus he didn't realize it was the lad from the rubber bandits @20:03
I don’t mean to be rude or anything but seriously “music”
I seen Jessica Buckley in a movie not long ago. “ I am thinking of ending things.” She plays an American girl but when I watched an interview of her she has a thick Irish Accent! I think she is from south west Ireland near Kerry County.
Irish accent : *sexiest accent in the world* Corpse husband : "finally a worthy opponent"
“Eat shit France!” -Jacksepticeye 2020
Brad Pitt was a gypsy not Irish i thought.
Thank you for making this, dear. This was fun!
I’m so proud of myself for understanding the Kerry accent 😂
Why do the rowers remind me of mcmurray from the show letterkenny
I love Jack watching/speaking Irish, cause his own accent comes out more and more as the videos go on
Jack : its oll don in good crack me : Ummm.... (pretending to know nothing) im so sorry if i spelled words wrong... im not irish
Isn't jamie dornan irish
I could understand the guy. You just have to listen carefully.
Being Irish I can understand this fine but I can see how others struggle

The bull mick Daly

Can you please play escapists 2 with friends?
Damn Jack is starting to being old, look at that white hair
They should've just hired Seán as an actor in these movies
2:22 why does his christopher walkins impression sound like arnold?
funniest video. Love it
Irish accents are sometimes as hard to understand as Irish words
"down in ballyhaunis"  *does shocked pikachu expression as i live in ballyhaunis*
jack can you watch history of entire world i guess its really good
I hate how Americans think that Ireland is like that portrayed in Wild Mountain Thyme, they must be so disappointed when they actually visit us 😂
There’s a show called hardy bucks. It’s itrish and filmed in Ireland. Like a comedy documentary “a day in the life of”. The accents and little sayings and dialects in that show make the comedy 100% better! I’m not Irish tho so that’s probably why it seems funny
I called a rude customer yesterday a bloody test and they had the biggest confused look on their face it was priceless. I live in Texas and omg I wish I took a picture
Loved this! 😂
Sean *N Irish man*: I’m great at this  *trYiNg tO Do N iRiSh AccEnT wHiCh He HaS*
You and Kevin watch a lot of the same videos.
I LOVE videos like this! I love how accents are so unique.
Your translations were actually amazing lol
....but have you seen Scottish Twitter?  Also, Italian... *chef kiss*
Why can I understand the Irish☘️ better than the English🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 😂 I’m Scottish🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
As a native of Tipperary take comfort in the fact that I struggle with understanding each of these accents too lol
My mom and aunt visited Ireland. The taxi driver accent was so thick they couldn't understand him very well. They got really hung up on the word kite for some reason 😂
Apparently I have 3 accents bundled together and different people hear them individually, some think I have an irish accent some think a Canadian accent  but I'm actually Geordie, for some reason I've not picked up the broad geordie accent.
I understood "bright out" and "mountain" from that guy talking didnt understand any other word
Wow  what a great french youtuber jack is
Brad Pitt actually plays a traveler man or gypsy, which it turns out can be used as a derogative term, but I'm not sure.
There are different accents in every area in Ireland, It’s just the same in England 😂, though they aren’t as interesting 🤣
Has anyone else noticed how jacks eyes faded from a bright peirceing blue to a silvery blue.
Nah Indian accent...supa sexy
Id love to see jack react to strong aussie accents or just any other accents and try to decode them
I wish the rest of the world made fun of each other's accents as much as irish people do their own 🤣
I tot that the sexiest is Filipino
The farmer with the lost sheep was definitely the most interesting, I've never heard anything quite like it. Btw, any other Aussies surprised to see us at number 5?
1:48  Jack: “ That’s what we do in Ireland, by the way. We just hang out in fields and run around with our arms out...in the middle of cattle. And then we jump on our horses and give it a smack and go...”  Also Jack: “ I LOVE NATURE!! (To equine) Come here... Let me love you!”  XD
I am irish and I don't even try to do it because I know it sucks. Come to think of it, I never spoke irish in my life. And I am *50% IRISH!*
Cmon jack, what about us up north!?
I absolutely lost it at "stab city" I like videos like this alot
I hear "my lover" all the time in Wales, didn't think it was Irish
These accents could pass as their own language.
Christopher Walken pretending to do an Irish accent!? Why was I not informed about this movie!? 😆😆😆
Nobody : Irish schoolboy : frostbutt
I had a dream where Sean came back too athlone and we were like best friends and I woke up proper sad cause I thought I was in town with him
I cant understand him at all, but like how can Sean I know it's his own accent but like how I just see colored sheep
I’ve been trying to learn Welsh and how it’s spoken in the north. Difficult isn’t even the right way to describe it, but I have so much respect for it.
if you are a cheater put on auto translate caption it isn't that bad it is pretty accrete (for English anyways)
People need to realise they're about Thurteeee Treeee different dialects within Ireland. I'm from Dublin and we've about 4 hahah. 🇮🇪
jack host meme review plsss
im Irish and people say i have a hot voice- its scary
So this is what non English speakers feel like when they hear us talk
You should listen to The Hunting Party audiobook, those accents are fantastic
Irish people don't say that, Sean says that, and is Irish, doesn't that mean Irish people say that?
The Farmer is so Irish even the loud Irish YouTube coffee man can't understand what he's saying
Not gonna lie, I was expecting to see some young offenders, but this was still epic
i have an irish teacher
My family is Irish but I’m Canadian and randomly when I talk I get a Irish accent
Actually the kiwi accent was voted most sexiest in the world so chur bro new zealand for the win 🇳🇿🇳🇿🇳🇿🇳🇿🇳🇿
Brad Pitt was playing a Piky. Its not Irish, its not English. It's jus piky... Lol LOVE that movie.
Top of the mornin to ya laddies
Guys. Support a small Irish YouTuber that’s reacting to this - just search ‘Irish actor reacts to wild mountain thyme’. She’s fuckin’ hilarious. Just thought she deserves a mention!
“It may be English.” I sure hope not, given that no one likes the English, least of all the Irish.
there were no lies in the original article. irish accents are the hottest. and irish men too (colin farrell, aidan turner, and you too sean fella). i just like listening to it!
Jack : "Brad Pitt isn't that bad"  Me : "how bout Unus "Norther Irish"  Nestor ?"
Voted sexiest by IRISH AROUND THE WORLD what a pat on the back
as a corkman from ireland   this video hurts to watch
They sound more Scottish then Irish
the way she said flower... literally how you say flower in french. And I say “mirrrrr” for mirror -i mean i’ve adopted a lot of british from my childhood of watching WAY too much british tv/movies so I occasionally say “li-tra-lee” and I say shit like “straw-burry” and “blue-burry”. I do have a speech problem tho....
Best vid ever hahaha but only because I'm irish
I know it will never happen but, it would be funny to see Seán react to Nogla’s rage moments cause that is something else
You got a play more minecraft
I know I sure enjoyed this Irish accent hole so feel free to go down it any time my dude.   ETA: uh...I did not mean that to sound as bad as it did lmao... I just legitimately enjoyed the video and I enjoy Irish accents and random Irish facts so it's fun any time you cover anything Ireland 🇮🇪
Them 2 irish rowers believe it or not, they came to my school and gave us like €5000
3:11 woah I was not ready to see my boy Jason Statham this early in the morning, needa go watch that movie gimme a few
“oil” ...... GIRL PLEASE AKDNFJFJFJFJ my irish ass is giggling
I used the kerry accent as a reference for a creative writing project. The one with the guy talking about sheep.
Did Jack not Mr. Chrome during the Limerick accent??
Watching you translate what the sheep herder said was honestly amazing, I barely understood a lick of it! Loved this video
froshbit
Vocal coach needs a new job ! 🤦🏼‍♀️
Irish accent : *sexiest in the world* Corpse husband : "I beg your pardon"
I've lived in the US so long my Irish accent almost sounds fake
Other countries:corona virus, fires, black lives matter  Ireland:we lost 45 sheep's today so we did so we did
why did at 2:22 he sound like he was trying to be Arnold Schwarzenegger lmao😂
Jack honestly has the best irish accent
I feel like most subscribers would just listen to you say jokes, the rest of your content is bonus. We just enjoy having you around man, thanks for being on here
how to do jackspedicey and pewdiepei minecraft accent
wonder if there are similarities between the Irish accent and the Newfoundlander accent considering Newfoundlanders are descendants of Gaelic people
Yes Sean, for 10 years watching you, I have heard nothing but this
You all don’t know jack like some of us. You haven’t seen the dude play skate 3, five nights at freddys, and turbo dismount. That’s the jack I know
Im acc from fermoy cork ireland hahah we are so delightful🤣🤣🤣
Hey, I'm part Italian, Jackie. How dare you 😒
I’m Irish and I legit can’t understand the farmer, I’m from the south too so...
"haha, Eat shit, France" Me (a French guy): anything for you Seán
She says the Irish accent is like music, obviously hasn't heard the inner city Dublin accent
Bell of wholesome
As a Scottish person, it's a skoosh Tae ken
Your accent. That's the Offaly-Tipperary accent I know and love, the one my aunt and her friends have. :) Reminds me of going down to Nenagh with her on trips and taking a peek in the bookshops there...and the castle too.
my parents keep trying to do an irish accent but it sounds scottish
That moment you realize Irish people hate "Far and Away", but it's still one of your favorite movies... 👁👄👁
I can only make out one or two words a sentence. Edit: now that I watched it again I can make out a few more words.
I'm from Southeast Kentucky. So glad I clicked on this.
sean let me move to your country
That schoolboy sounds like he has a  very strong Glaswegian accent
8:20 im just built different😈😈😈
Watch sir Stivo Timothy
“Brad Pitt, you’re lucky you’re gorgeous”  Jack-2020
I absolutely <3 your accent! Probably my favorite one. Watching you play games makes my day because your accent gets me giggling all the time. Esp. fuck because it sounds like fawk and i snort really hard.
You know what? Fifth sexiest accent in the world, I’m fine with that
An Irish man making a bad Irish accent what just happened
I like Filipino and Japanese accents. They're adorable.
He's speaking the language of the gods
I learned my last name comes from a show called The Brady Bunch. Thought ah well that's pretty cool, something to brag about..  Found out I'm part Irish from my father's side. Im feeling bloody lucky at this point got my Claddagh ring. Been in New Zealand my whole life and find out Irish accent is the most sexiest. Now how do I speak that without sounding frustrated.  This clip was hilarious btw.
Never! Jack, you will need to apply again for your gaouler license before being let back in.
The more you listen the easier it gets 😂
Oh holy Mary the country lads have the absolute maddest accent even I can't tell what their on about
Please do more of these videos!!!!
At 7:00 the farmer looks like if Bill Murray and Tom Hanks had an irish little boy.
I legitimately thought for years that Brad Pitt's accent in Snatch was supposed to be a Newfie accent. And now I really, really want to see Jack's reaction to various Newfie accents
I want more videos like this :)
👍
Is nobody talking about Australian being the 5th sexiest accent? That has to be the biggest troll ever. Margot Robbie is really carrying that title on her shoulders because the rest of us sound like gumbies
that farmer wasn't even speaking english I'm pretty sure that was native irish.
11:13 got me
Omg yes I agree about how cringy it is. I hear people at my work try to do an Irish accent. I mean I realize that the southern states in the United States are mostly irish descendent. But jesus mary and Joseph just no
Is the farmer even speaking English??
When you're shipwrecked, scared, confused, and the captain asks you to send up the signalling device: 11:57
Why does jack sound like yancy at 2:22?
When Jack is somewhat British and Somewhat Irish: OI YA TWAT
You know Irish accents aren't the only accents that are the most elusive. Australian accents are pretty close if not equally as elusive. I've heard plenty of bad Australian Accents
how is this english @6:11
I can tell how hes got 362 dislikes from this video.
Sean... we understand you! Its not like we've just been nodding our heads and saying yes every few minutes hahahahahAHAHAHAHAHA
I lived in Kerry for 16 years, the same place this old man is from... I can’t understand most of what he’s saying!
12:36 Lol Sean's face just said wtf is this lady talking about?
Yo jack you should do this again with the irish lads
Yeah I like the first one
nahhh the Dublin accent got me 😂 I'm Scottish and the Dublin accent sounds like the Irish equivalent of a Strathclyde University accent 😂😂😂
America: Trash. Ireland: SHRASH
I was chewing so loud I thought I heard him say we say “sh” as “t” and so I immediately thought, “From shit to tit!”
That farmer just sounds like he's speaking Gaelic.
Thanks for translate
Im from glasgow and im working in edinburigh just now and there is an irish guy on the building site with hands down the thickest accent i have ever heard and surprise surprise i found out last week his name is paddy haha
I'm watching because people kept saying I sounded GAA-lik (spelled phonetically) - isn't that Scottish pronunciation?-  and have been repeatedly asked where I'm from originally (annoying because I'm like 5th gen Canadian). I have Irish ancestry and my mom's family is from Ottawa Valley (large population of Irish people in Canada). My mom and auntie have pretty strong accents so I think I picked it up by accident. It popped up on my Ancestrydna test as 25% Irish, which is way higher than I expected.  I'm subscribed, definitely love the memes and the Irish content.
Are you going to play Earthbound?
somehow this was one of my favourite videos he’s ever made
Was anyone else waiting to see if Conor McGregor was going to show up in the video
If you get to go back to Ireland, could you do a vlog in Killarney? My boyfriend and his sister were from there and I've always wanted to see where they came from.
Non-Irish People: "They all sound the same"
A sure lad he is an Irishman
I disagree.    I don't care how irish the accent is. If it's just a little bit russian...
R.I.P. Jacksepticeye’s funniest home videos
Jack's accent is the best. 😍
I bet Filipino accent can compete as the sexiest accent of the world
Someone walks into the bathroom with an Irish accent and walls out of the bathroom with an Irish accent, but what is their accent in the bathroom?            Some smartos might say “Well, technically Irish,” but the real answer is that their accent is European Don’t ask me to explain the joke... just don’t
that farmer at 6:17 sounds like Ozzy Osbourne speaking german with an irish accent
The only accent I understood was the Dublin one which isn't surprising since my Maternal ancestors came from there, actually my paternal ancestors came from your part of the country Jack.  This is funny because  if I talk really fast I have and Irish accent even though I am Canadian.
9:33 Irish Jim
Canadian here, I know EXACTLY how you feel. In the movie “Super Troopers 2”, they gave all the Canadians French accents(or at least what Americans THINK the French accent sounds like) instead of Québecois accents, and it’s really jarring.  Clearly they didn’t know the difference, and simply assumed that Québec would have the same accent as France for some fuckin reason, but it really grinds me ears to hear that shite.  For a good Canadian and Québécoise accent, look up the show “Letterkenny”, especially the scene with “les Hicks” that brilliantly demonstrates the rivalry between Québec and Ontario as the boys ice fish.
You are so smell amazing Jack
Wait jack is irish
such a stupid smile on my face watching this
Irish Man
This was the best. Lol made my day
“Eat SHIT, France.” My new favorite quote. :)

"START DRINKING MORE MILK BITCH" Me: Is cereal not enough?! ARE YOU KIDDING ME
If you say "fuck off" backwards it's still fuck off but in Irish accent 😂
Brad Pitt in snatch plays an Irish traveller  Its a bit different than actual Irish  Absolutely amazing film
5:31 it sounds like every single one of the keys on the keyboard are sticky
I live in Ireland since I was 10 years old, I am exactly 20 years old now and English is my most used and fluent language. Still have anxiety every day that I won't understand the thicc accents of the Irish townsfolk so I just stay home in fear
The characters of Wild Mountain Thyme sounds more Wild Western than irish..
Reply to my comment, Yung LTL❤️
9:45 I’m from ballyhaunis lol didnt realise it was a very known place haha just a tiny fuckin town in the west
Is breà leis na Gaeil faoin aimsir
There's this character in Red Dead Redemption 2 named Sean, and he has a very good Irish accent. You should listen to it in your free time!
That is so funny because I am Russian and I can understand you perfectly, but my mother can't understand a word you say
Hello there
Jamie with the cast trying to do the accent :❔👄❔
The welsh all have different accent like in the valleys they sound so welsh were in the south like me we have a different welsh accent but i love wales am proud to be welsh and we all freindy peoples here we also have the coolest flag
My grandfather was an Irishman! I loved his stories he would tell me about the place and i always wanted to visit. Thats how I got my name. The "Hill of Tara" is what i think I remember it was from.
he sounds like a sims character
the amount of jacks videos ive watched and the amount of times ive watched the young offenders... im used to it
question!!!!!! do you speak Irish like i know its not English with an accent there are some languages ?
Hi my name  Dominic
Jack, just so you know, your accent is not that thick imo
Ah I was hoping you'd do the Tip one! Makes me miss the family over there and it's the only Irish accent I can do.
Yo I have been here since 1k subs and ur my childhood YouTuber anyway thx for making my childhood bro best of luck and keep up the good work you happy wheels legend
I wish I was more Irish 🥺😭 genuinely 🥺😭
Im Irish but I wasn't born in Ireland so I don't have the best accent in the world :(
0:43 Me who drinks in the morning: How dare you?
To be honest i dont understand a thing HAHAHAHAHHAHAJAJAA
I can understand basically what he is saying but I have to concentrate really hard and I cant understand every word
Jack would be the perfect Lucky charms mascot change my mind
Not Irish-flour That one lady teaching you a single Irish accent-flerr
The mirror one is for reals Mirrrrr or drawer
I really want to see him react to a Newfoundland accent. Cause it has a lot of Irish influence and it's kind of a mess to listen to if you're not used to it.
This video left me with a massive smile on my face
Is it weird that I understood all of them 🤣
As an Irishman these accents are normal,Sean has just forgotten our Irish accents and our potato’s
I feel like if someone had that thick of a accent then they could make a joke about you in English and you wouldn't get it
Good lord...i watch this while having my breakfast and needless to say i eat my breakfast wayyyyy longer than i usually did 🤭 thank you for the wholesome content ❤️
The video: how to do an Irish accent Seán: I’m pretty good at this! All the viewers:...
That accent is like a combination 15 differnt languages with broken American english Edit: holy hell this video is gold
I'm bad at noticing accents. First sheep farmer remained a partial mystery but others sound completely normal to me.   Only thing I noticed was that Irish apparently like talking really fast
just go to west Kerry
If I were to practice an Irish accent what one would you recommend.
Kevin could understand the shepard guy, holy fuck Jack.
Hey jacksepticeye question did you ever see or hear of the show the adventures of pigley winks or jakers because i always heard an irish accent XD
This was great
Irish people: speak. Subtitles: Music
Reporter's name: Seán Mac an tSithigh Me, immature: Sean Mac an TEEHEE
My dad's side of the family has a mix between an Irish accent and a south Boston accent I'm from a town East of Boston, however I have a Midwestern accent, meaning I don't have an accent  In all honest, half the time idk what they're saying so I just smile and nod.......
I'm sure I'm not the first to write this but, Jack's Christopher Walken accent is better than Christopher Walken's Irish accent.
.....kevin       didn't realize jack and Kevin were the same pffdsd
I liked the one with the Irish accent.
hey jack,,,,there's a youtube site that is just fascinating and incredible,,,Daily Dose of Internet,,it's amazing

In the last part of the video about the limerick accent I'm actually in shock that Jack didnt know who the guy in the spar bag was!!! Hes one of the rubberbandits!! 😱😱
Pretty sure I drove past one of the recording sites for that movie
Noooooooo! More irish!!! Moooaaar!
Saoirse Ronan: Am I a joke to you
HEY MA MA JACK IS FAMOUS
“What the f*ck Jeff” got me 😂😂
I agree Irish accents are pretty sexy...
olard I couldna halp loozin' m'shit ah "FROSHBUTT" boyo. Marficul bloo jezus.
I'm Irish and I found it hard to understand the farmers
I don't know jack that one from Kerry kind of sus
I was really hoping that Sean was going to react to the character Rory Flanagan ( actor Damian Mginty) from glee
I’m Irish and I can barely understand that Kerry man holy god
20:30 I’ve always appreciated this about Irish folk, being from Texas I feel like we have that in common...yee-haw
I’m 70% Irish and that one sheep herder confused me a lot
7:19 - I'm sorry; I saw that name and just thought "Sean Mac An tsithigh mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn"  XD
Do Irish people understand one another?
Seán travelling across Ireland!! Make it happen. 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍 YESSSS
Petition for jack to use his old intro again

Send help, I want an Irish boyfriend all of a sudden😅
Thumbnail bad Irish accents i can't even understand everybody our king has fallen
Can we just quickly appreciate Seans Christopher Walken impression?
Jack please do a video on Crash Bandicoot 4
Jacksepticeye..worlds greatest version of google translate
I just noticed how similar Jack and I’s accents are(I’m from southern WV), and besides some of the slang being different it’s actually very similar.
My Grandads Irish!
“Haha eat shit France”  I love that sentence
Music she calls it  I call it a bit of hodgepodge and mismatched sounds
19:22 I hadn't realized that Jacksepticeye took over the narration lol.
OMG this is the most fun video you have done in a long time!
"Eat *shit* France" Chill man 🤣
Seán: Bad Irish accents that even I can't understand. Also Seán: "COMININADALITTLEBITLTLTLTADELAY"
There is only like 4 variations of the American accent
It's funny because I started watching Jack because we were doing dialects in my theatre class. Came for the accent, stayed for the laughs :)
next video: Among Us But With Horrible Irish Accent
What about Marty McFly’s many greats grandfather in Back To The Future 3, I’m pretty sure he had an Irish accent but was it good?
Jack sounds just like a Leprechaun would sound. Except he doesn't swear enough.🤣
When she said “flour” it sounded like “flare”
Haha! LOVED your reaction to the Wild Mountain Thyme trailer - I did a reaction video for it too! The accents... well, let’s just say we Irish are finding them interesting...! Fellow Midlands dweller 👍☺️
You should be in a Irish movie
i am Dutch i think the how to do Irish accent is cringe
The Limerick city accent is a force to be reckoned with
Cyark bai      <3 from Cork
That guy is Not speaking English, like how
You're the best YouTuber ever Sean
listen to me when i say this, i will never in my life hear a convincing texan accent unless you are from texas. EVER. NO ONE EVER DOES IT RIGHT
I love the fact of listening to these people and I learned how to speak galic and I sound so different. I sound more simular to you but that could be because I picked up the accent from my mum's side
Sean, I personally find you very easy to understand. You have much more clarity in your diction than many of the fools we have in the state where I live. You're awesome.
Y'all sound like Newfies to me.
Parts of the first accent explanation video sounded more like parts of Scotland
Him translating the farmers blew my mind lol what a precious bunch of old men but I couldn’t understand shit
For literal years the way Jack says “height” as “heighth” annoyed me so much. Also good job not getting political and calling Northern Ireland “Ireland”
You should do a video about the Forgotten Irish Language. Gaelic.....I can never understand what my mom is saying and she speaks it!
I don’t get a lot of things.. but apparently I understand the Irish accents
For what i received i passed on to you as of first importance: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, that He was buried, that He was raised on the third day according to the scriptures  1 Corinthians 15 3     PS: "according to the Scriptures" - what the Apostle means is that Lord Jesus fulfilled prophecy's of the Prophets of God in Old Testament. There are like hundreds of Prophecies that Lord Jesus fulfilled, just look it up bruhs and gurls. God is our Father. He is the best of Fathers, the most lovable and merciful of fathers. Read the whole uncensored Bible that is Catholic(The Original) and  pray my friends. Wish you all well🙏amen🙏
Normal people: tf is that one dude saying Seán: so he's saying
The sheep guy is Russian
jack stop putting coffee  ads that aren't your's
Us the guy in how to train your dragon irish??? the bestfriend of hicup(idk any spelling of there name) dad?
“If I do sound like that I’m sorry” lol 😂
Off topic (ish) But imagine Jason Statham being afraid of Brad Pitt 🤣🤣
The lady teaching the Irish accent sounds a lot more like a Newfoundland (in Canada) accent
What's really interesting is that I can hear the influence on the accent in my city Pittsburgh. Our accent and slang is influenced by scotch Irish, Pennsylvania Dutch (ie German spoken by Amish and Mennonites), and Eastern European like Polish, Russian, and Hungarian. I think the Irish shows in how we say, or rather don't say, the th sound. Like we'll refer to our city as "Da 'Burgh" or totally omit it in the case of the phrase "'n' 'at" (and that). I also find myself saying f instead of th lime in funk for think but I'm not sure if it's accent or mild speech impediment. Also we mush up our words-  iron is arn (1 syllable) and when I say Irish it can come out as Arsh, again just one syllable.   This could also be due to the other influences on our accent, but the similarities in this video were interesting.
Alternative title: Jacksepticeye but it gets gradually more Irish
It's official, I MUST learn the Irish accent NOW.  Even if it is nearly midnight.
Damn, that heavy irish accent sounds like they speaking in reverse. Ican imagineiftheywriteareportorsomething, they’llforgetacomaanditwouldbelikethis.
React to the rubberbands there gas 😂 there from limerick
Me and my daddy where wondering how to say mirror we never found out.                 MIRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!!!!!!!!!!!

I’m from Ireland and I have trouble understanding some people
Jacks next video”24 HOURS IN TALLAGH (GONE WRONG)
Petition for Sean to do a video on how to do an Irish accent
Finally a jacksepticeye vidéo that isn’t pure aids
he really said "blaahd flaahhw" in the beginning there
I have a kind of heavy accent. Is this how evry guy outside of my region is fealing when I speak to them?? xd
When Jack translated the Irish farmer and referenced Hot Fuzz i died of laughter
My Scottish ears have aided me here in understanding my Gaelic brethren, (likely because Irish people had a large influence on Scottish people's accent)
I think I only understood it cause Aussie accents are heavily influenced by Irish and many others 😅🤷‍♀️ As I say.. Then there's Australia... The country where every accent gets thrown in a blender given to a kangaroo, regurgitated up, then drowned in the sea for a while then spread unevenly across the entire continent...
Listening to this video makes me want to talk in an irish accent even tho I know it probably sound like shiet
Then theres us from norn Ireland. .. our accents are something else
Brad Pitt is NOT doing an Irish accent it's a travelers accent
Fun Fact: The Boston accent is derived from Irish-Americans. Everytime I hear someone try it in a movie it's so obvious their not from Boston. I myself is from Massachusetts and have Irish grandparents so bad accents are easy to hear.
Hey Jack! I just wanna let you know that Subnautica Below Zero was updated. It looks prettier, the entire story was changed again, and all the dialogue is voiced. It’s also a lot scarier, and they changed the soundtrack (plus there’s a bunch of new characters and creatures)! There’s so many more things they added and I want you to check it out. The game is really really good now, and I’m requesting that you do another playthrough of this game please! After all, you are the Subnautica king!  :D
No complaints about the Australian accent being up there. None from Jack either
those rowers r HOT
I need 4 hours more of this, please, Sean 😂
It looks like a band ass hallmark movie
I started pissing myself laughing when Cork and Limerick popped up as both of my grandparents come from both counties 😂😂
20:57 ah sure ya know yerself like go raibh míle síle
Jack talks shit.   Also Jack  I already do that this is so dumb        Me: what?
Being American all done in good crack means something else
0:16 Well it’s a good lad I’m Irish.
im crying right now hes the best my child hood is all about him and i even had a birthday about him im so happy for him i sub since 5k
Um i just saw that sweden was number 7 on the list... who tf made that list? As a swede myself i only see when movies and media make fun of our accent ”yaa, mah name is Helga, im a blonde swede” (btw that shit is hillarious!😂) never ever have i heard that someone thinks swedish is sexy, the people gets called sexy, but not the accent 😂
Me after watching all of dreams videos   Sean: a unsub sub rashio    Me: DREAMMMMMMMMMMMM
Nah but this is why accurate representation is so important lamdkwkf cause like if ppl watch that and thats all they know of Ireland...its unfortunate.  edit:  just saying this to put in perspective for groups that are generally underrepresented   Also I loved this video cause of how he was able to laugh at it
CallmeKevin already did this I’m copy striking you
Póg mo thóin
jacksepticeye is swedish now
Yours is the best Jack. Its the most unique cause of everywhere you have been its not just Irish anymore.
17:48 "Yer wan" (meaning "that woman" in Irish slang) is possibly a shorthand for "your woman". I couldn't find any sources for its origin, but my best guess is that it initially referred to a female partner ("your wife", "your girlfriend") and then eventually was generalized for any woman. Something similar applies to "yer man" (meaning "that man" in Irish slang).
i think the poor farmer was missing 45 sheep lol
Went to N. Ireland for like 6 weeks, all the kids didn't believe I was American because I picked up the accent in like a week.
Brad played a gypsy, hes speakin Pyky
Is it bad that I can understand all of them???
I’m not entirely convinced the sheep farmer wasn’t speaking another language.
I FKN LOVE IRELAND PLEASE 😭🧡🧡🧡🧡🧡🧡🧡🧡 gawd. Hahaha nothing will change my mind, i will retire in Ireland.
The intro made me flash back to 2 men 200 accents 👁👄👁👏
Jamie dornan from the first movie is actually Irish which is the only thing they’ve done right in that movie
Sean doesn't have  a Irish accent he just shouts and calls himself irish
Young offenders county cork 🙌🏼
I am part irish and it is not that hard to do if you put some effort in doing it and I can do a great irish accent
*Irish people only* Ní riabh fhaca mé beirt cáirde háillean, cathfigh duine acú bheidh grána!!
European news are weird don’t ask questions
I’m Irish but I don’t even have a fuckin accent so what’s the point!
If you see this (you know who).. text me back ;)
2:21 Arnold Schwarzenegger is that you?
Jack play tabs there is a new update there is unit creator creator
I think the best one was Seán’s
You missed the, God awful atrocity that is Leonardo Dicaprio in 'Gangs of New York'
Ive lived in tipp and Limerick since I was 5. I can understand less than this Irish lad. Limerick and tipp is pretty understandable in comparison to Kerry. That shits barely intelligible  The Limerick accent at the end was too good. It was beautiful.
We need a review of Wild Mountain Thyme from you, Jack!
I never want the Irish reaction videos to end jack there not there haliours
Sean are you growing grey hairs 🥺
Hey hey now, scotland got sexiest 2020 so hush your mouth
he said there was ab 50 sheep missing, nice translation sean
Can we get a podcast
Mirrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
Me (not native English speaker) trying to understand anything from these videos: 🙂
Hopefully, I will visit family in Cork and not in Kerry because I'd just smile and nod 😂
Idk if this makes sense but thick Irish accents have really similar rythms and phonetics as swedish🤔😂
" I'm a vowel bender ".....🤣🤣🤣
Those Two Rowers Came To My School A Few Years Ago
There does seem to be some "ui" in an irish accent, but there's also a lot of "aye" sound where "-oy" shows up (see: boys)
MORE MORE MORE  this was so funny I really enjoyed it
I feel glad that he say anything about Australian accent
Irish accents are awesome! I love asking my Irish friend to say 33, he doesn't mind and it's one of the best things ever!!! 😊 Sean is very easy to understand, lovely accent. Much more interesting then mine 😆
Scrolls down slightly:  Buy my merch:Top of the morning coffee
Spread this message across YouTube.  “If YouTube actually starts putting ads on non-monetized videos by creators who never asked for them, that just goes to show how greedy this corporation can be. This thought is disgusting. YouTube is essentially making free money off small channels and not paying them a single penny. Yes, these are small channels, but since there's so many of them, YouTube will still make a huge profit off of this new policy. I don't care if YouTube hates us now, it must be said by someone. I urge to our subscribers that we spread the message to all creators, and urge YouTube to immediately repeal this new policy.”
Am I the only one who feels deaf when I watch this?
I would love to see Jack try to understand my Appalachian accent 🤣
I've been listening to the most recent Skulduggery Pleasant book and the guy tried to do different accents for everyone. I mean I can tell they're different but it's neat to see where some of them come from (his American accent is just weird though 😂)
Me when i realized im mostly irish: 0-0
6:20 reminds me when no one undertsood the story cause it was in irish and our teacher was translating but was disappointed that no one understood it
mfw he didn't know the rubberbandits
She put like a d4 and a northern Irish accent as the one
I love 0:24 “GET FOCKED ITALY!” and “EAT SHET FRANCE”
making fun of the accents of your own language is so funny  ^^ whatever the language
I'm Irish and I understand this really well
The best accent their was the cork one up the rebels
I'm also appalled, Sean that you said "look at the boy with the spar bag on his head" .. do you not recognise your own BLIND BOY from The Rubberbandits?? FOR SHAMEEE
im not going to tell ya a word of a lie but im irish and when the irish farmer came on i coud only under stand half of what he was on about
Hahahah it's one of the guys Rubberbandits as the Limerick graphic
The rowers are the easiest to understand lmao
Tell me I’m not the only one readin all these comments in my head with an Irish. Accent now
While fully acknowledging that Americans know nothing about the rest of the world, I feel it's fair to point out that other countries don't know anything about America either. As Exhibit A I present that god-awful BBC Radio adaptation of Pet Semetary they did. Seriously, if you're not American and you listen to that and think it sounds fine, you've proved my point. btw this is meant to be friendly ribbing, not an insult :) ...except to the BBC Radio adaptation people who made that awfulk show. They can feel insulted
9:15 is at my limit of understanding. If I really try I can sorta understand.
When she taught us how to saw flour it sounded like Fluer from Harry Potter
Irish are awesome  Who ever is irish drink jack daniels and cheer wahoo
I think he’s speaking a forbidden language or something like that
Weird for sure, but that was a fun video. Thanks :)
Yoooo... jacks getting hella white hair
10:20 I’m worried. Very worried
What happened to the high five at the beginning of videos?
fuckin meme matirial 1:40
If thats Irish, then the Irish are speaking klingon to me and I'm 1/2 irish..lol 😆 🤣 😂
I love that farmer from Kerry even if I understood about three words 🙈
Callmekevin and Sean should do a in person collab,since they only live about 481 miles away from each other
I heard you say bigfoot
The Kerry folks are essentially speaking an entirely different language.
For real! Why did they not hire Irish people!?
bro im so fuckin mad, im 90% irish and aint got a Irish accent, i got me a shitty Baltimore accent
Please do a part 2!!!
The Loudest Youtuber hasn't heard himself yet? WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT!?
Hey could you play genshin impact its a great game that deserves recognition and the community of it would apreciate it a lot a lot.
Anyone else think christopher wallin sounds a bit like liam neeson
Mirrr That one's easy xD
Imagine being able to pinpoint all the accents in the video *cough cough*
I smashed the like button when he called me a Bitch ... XD
I’m Irish and those farmers are an enigma
3:06 I thought he said innit like tommyinit
Like Kendrick Lamar said. Man down, where you from my Irishman? This is stab city where you from my irishman.
Why can I understand this language they call Irish so well and I've lived in America for 16 years and the closest thing to Irish I've ever heard or seen is mister Sean McLaughlin
smart to cut out the north to stop people getting pissed off in the comments lmao
“I’m good at this” Jack, while watching a video that explains the Irish accent. This is the comedy I adore.
Tbh tho in snatch he's more based of a "pikey" in that film and thats just how they talk 🤷🏻‍♂️😂
Me: I’m Australian what is he saying Jack: it’s easy just listen
It’s right to give God the credit and not brad Pitt or anyone else.
being irish myslef it comes naturally but you really gotta focus on the sheep one dam
I said to my mum : Nothing like the sound of an Irish man in the mornin !  *With a sudden slight Irish accent *
American accents are boring but at lest  north is better than the south. I'm from Florida but I live in Orlando so I don't have a heavy southern accent. Florida in itself is weird.
Seán should be a translator for police investigators.
Yas, 3rd place for us. A bronze medal to go with our irn bru tans.
Imagine having that Irish dude wake you up every day by whispering in your ear
Jack: says he cant understand some irish accent  Me: still try to remember what that one guy who stopped me on the streets with a thick jamaican pidgin was asking me  MI MON? WERES DI GAS STATION NEARES DI LOCATED INNA?
"I'm a vowel bender" 😂
It’s awesome to hear a lot of accents around the world. English is my second language (I’m Mexican) and accents are actually a barrier sometimes. Just in Mexico our accents are way too different depending if you’re from the south, Mexico City, or the north.
"Say top of the morning to ya"...."Irish people don't say that" (says it in every video)
Damn Jack when did you learn Sage Jutsu?
Lol he said start drinking more milk
My grandma has a thick Irish accent, and when I was younger I remember every one couldn't understand her, but I understood her.   I live in Australia, and I sometimes slip into the accent as I use to spend all my time with her and her surrounding family when I was really little.
My dad puts on an Irish accent all the time... It's not great.
When I try doing an Irish accent,it sound like a fucked hybrid of Irish,Scottish,British,and Australian.
Jack: I'll translate. Me a Irishman: Hmm you think i need help ha puny human
This is how I feel with Irish grandparents, especially when they come back from visiting Ireland and their accents are stronger than ever ahaha. Ones southern and ones northern so it’s completely different ahah
Do another one of these but with different languages. Interesting what your insight would be.
I’m jealous like we have you too our left with your beautiful accent then up north Scotland who’s accent I think is also really good and then England I’m the middle and we’re just boring compared to you two
Drink some milk.........That just broke me!!!!! Also.....of course Sean would find a way to get Hot Fuzz into the video
No you’re crystal clear when you talk my friend.
I love that he made a hot fuzz reference
im cringing
I'm so glad I Row at skibbreen rowing club
Jack the frostbit guy is northern Irish
Hi Sean
i loved this Idk why
Mate I'll unsubscreeb coz I'm Scottish
As a Newfoundlander, I feel your pain. It's either people don't understand you, or no one knows how to do it. I recommend listening to it sometime. It's the bastard child of Irish, English, Scottish, and French.
Im over here watching this Jackie boy, and im at work, now I am talking with your accent instead of my own, and I cant help it. Lmfao. Love ya bro.
I’m Irish and I tried to do a accent but I’m bad
How is italian I hate italian accents I want to die to them some of them that is I can't stand super high pitched voiced or accents my fav are Russian and irish polish and british aren't bad too I love how Russians roll there rs and have a brass voice also want to say I had a irish accent but thanks to schools I was turned like a native american to fit in and .. it's barely there now working on making it stronger again I miss it
HE'S NOT ORDINARY IRISH HE'S A P!KEY WHICH IS AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT ETHNIC GROUP
Omg we watched the Irish farmers lose their sheep video in my vet class and My friend Ally and I looked at each other and laughed😂😂 we said Jack as we looked at each other😂😂
0:42 I'm already drinking milk lol
Sounds like gru🤣
Me: I'm a Brazilian but I can speak english verry well and understand it quite easily! Irish accent: *Exists* Me: I don't understand A SINGLE WORD he's saying I feel dumb
You should take a look at Jessie McParland on Britain's Got Talent. Her accent isn't as strong as some of those in this video but she's so adorable 😍
Am I the only one that noticed that Seán's teeth are nice and straight now? Good job with the invisiline!
i went to irland to visit family and this is so funny  beqacus it true
I was hoping Jack would watch the video titled "The STRONGEST Irish Accent You'll Ever Hear!"
I’m Irish and British and I have a normal accent
I'm CRYING 😂🤣😂  Absolutely loved this vid,  And of course your accent is my favorite 👌
Love all the Irish accents and this was truly a lovely video. I wish I could accomplish a decent accent interpretation but watching this showed me im far from it
Brad Pitt kinda sounded like a Newfoundlander, like Donnie Dumphy, I think.
Turg
Me growing up welsh, visiting my Irish relatives. Lovely people, but damn, I cant even understand the Welsh accent, so its a nightmare for me to understand them xD
Turg
Honestly, it didn't make me laugh like crazy (maybe bc I'm not Irish) but I enjoyed watching the vid seeing Seán happy and laughing.
Turg
Turg
Turg
what makes it so hard to understand is that they just say what they gotta say in one long train of words instead of sentences lol
Before jack translates, I want to have a go at it. "Its strange that people would jack my sheep since its bright out 'n shit." That's all.  Edit: aaand I'm wrong.
Irish language being music to the ears if you ask me. But hearing it explained, not so much.
You know im not afraid to say it but you've either lost or never had a Midlands accent
HHHHERB
I didn’t know jack went to UL. I live like 20mins away. If only I knew.
"Good as a concept, but I'm not being a test subject"
The guy with a very thick accent literally sounded like he was talking in a different language. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Aww. You miss it here Jack? *Looks outside at the pissing rain*
That other guy looked like Irish g man
You forgot the Donegal accent in the Irish orals
I’m Irish and I can barely catch a few words that that man says.
cork was interesting
Jack: some people try to do an Irish accent and it just sounds horrible.  Unus Annus: ........
Gotta love Jack ❤ Aka Sean
The ONE time they appropriate a white culture. Welcome to being a person of color. 😐
I thought my grandad had a strong accent
Thnak youf
wait so where is seán from?
When you think ah sure everyone here is also Irish but he has over 6 times more subscribers than our population
No fuckin way she's not english I ben to england all over and that's english.
6:16 Im sorry WHAT? You could understand that??????????
To be fair to Brad Pitt, he's doing a Irish traveller accent as opposed to a typical Irish accent, or as they call them in the movie, "Pikies" haha
sean, please watch the Try Channel! i love listening to them talk (or giggle, mostly) while they try different foods nad mostly drinks!
In English at my school we had to watch a movie called war of the buttons and it’s in Ireland about kids going to war against a rival town to sell tickets
FARTY FOVE?
The Irish accent is more iconic than Superman in my eyes
Am I the only one who was absolutely appauled at the fact that he didn't recognise the rubber bandits from Limerick, HE EVEN POINTED OUT THE SPAR BAG LIKE 😂😂😂 were lockin him out of Ireland 😂😂
I can't believe they showed frostbit boy
“Why he built like that”
Only reason I can understand that farmer is because I’m from Kerry but just about 😂
Me being from limerick but don’t have a accent 😳
Hahahahaha omg Ruairi Caoimhin Rapheal McSorley aka "Frostbit kid" went to my school up in Derry 😂 he's a fantastic lad and true culchie 😁
I absolutely love learning about other cultures and I know basically nothing about Ireland,,so these videos are always amazing! 💚
we out here from cork
Is it just me or do the nps in papers please sound irsh
i’m scottish, and im thinking thats given me an advantage because i understand almost every word spoken
Is it weird that I was able to understand almost all the Irish accents? 😂
You’re one doing the “how to do an Irish accent” cracked me the fuck up.
I don't know why but "what the FUCK Jeff" got me
The only thing I understood was 45 sheep lol
Mirrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
This video made me smile. Thanks :)
15:53 - 16:05 Had me laughing and then ‘Keep it in the blindfold Jeff’ 😂😂💀💀
Even further back in the day, (1998!) I'd just left London and was overseas calling random BBC offices to order a copy of the original Neverwhere book (winding up with mostly tapes) and something about reaching the Dublin BBC was SO STARTLINGLY REFRESHING AND CLEAR. Someday I will attempt to write an essay on what the hell that experience was.  It was similar to being in France for a year, hearing no English, and then suddenly hearing an excited American five-year-old in a city center.  Like cold fresh water.  Like vacation "I don't have to TRY for this one!!" (Even though trying is super rewarding too!) People and languages and voices and all are weird and wonderful and will never cease to fascinate. (Lord, Covid isolation is gonna madden and then kill me, I need to hear other voices SOON,  I wanna go to Wales)
This is one of the greatest videos ever made.
You didn't recognize Blindboy!
Most of my family are from cork and trying to understand what they are saying is like trying to use a fork to eat soup
I still can’t believe that wild mountain thyme is supposed to be modern day Ireland, I’m sorry but fuck noooo 😂 Also the lad with the spar bag on his head was supposed to be one of the rubberbandits
I love u Sean Mclaughlin  u my f av yter  but I'm 13......
One of the person that makes me inlove with Irish accent.. Pierce Brosnan... He's soo good especially in the movie The Foreigner... Daaamn Irish Accent sounds gud...
Yea that's right shawn dont say shit about Australias accent, smart choice pal 😑
Jack, PLEASE do more commentary vids
i could understand what he's saying cuz i spend an afternoon looking it up lol
Brad wasnt just Irish. He was a jipcy
Love this 🤣❤
2:20 he sounds like FRICKIN ARNOLD SHWARTZENAGER (sorry if i spelled it wrong)
Can you do vr
I really dislike the irish accent on men (sorry seán i love you though) but on a women, damn gets me feeling rigid
Irish farmer named "Sean mac an tiddie"
Jack: Why didn't you cast Irish people?  Jamie Dornan: Am I a joke to you?  Jamie Dornan is literally an Irish actor
The Cork accent is the worst, my god it goes through your head 😂😂
Well, Jack If I'm Being Honest The Accent I Liked The Most Was Yours.
Your voice is higher pitch than you hear when you talk because of the vibration in your head ... so you do kind of sound like that 🤣 Your the Irish Charlie Day!
10:45  The U.S. speaking in Sandy Cheeks: DiD SuMbOdDy sAay OiL?  Lol in all honesty I love the Irish, American here and while I unfortunately haven't had time for learning other languages (ed system doesn't bother much to teach us other languages and it sucks just teaching us Spanish anyway), I've still practiced many accents throughout my young life, Irish being one of them and out of all the Irish accents there are to study, the "oil" that she claims is in the "I'll" isn't really what I'm hearing. To me, it's just a heavier "I" because the Irish speak in much firmer tones than average Americans do. Love ya and your accent, Jack! The vigor in your accent is as good as a morning cuppa coffee!
do more of this lol i love it
Can we appreciate how wholesome Jack is? And how fun this video was like man
PLEASE DO MORE OF THESE I LAUGHED THE WHOLE TIME I LOVED THIS
The problem with generalizing the irish accent is that you can start one place and then go out few mile this way or that and the whole accent changes on ye. it's feckin insane! Ahem, yeah there's many types.
How do you understand that?!??!!??!??
If I didn’t know jack and saw him in public and had a conversation with him I wouldn’t know he was Irish unless he said something with a hard accent
How the FOOK IS THIS SEXIER THAN BRITISH?!  AT LEAST YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THE BRITS (most of them XD) PLUS IRISH JUST SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE DRUNK WHILE TALKING AROUND FOOD
As an American wife to an Irishman, I can confirm that yes, Irish accents are indeed sexy. ;) As far as *YOUR* accent goes, Sean, you're similar to my husband in that it's very Americanized, sans some pronunciation differences here and there, and of course when you're playin' vidya games with the lads sometimes your Irish accent comes on a bit thicker.
Yeah I'm from offaly and never knew I had an accent then I was talking to some lads in England and apparently I've a strong one. Also any midlanders often won't use t's or th's
Im irish but i dont have no accent at least not like the foke in Cork
I am going to live in Cork next year 😂 didn’t know it was one of the strongest accents. My poor American accent 😩😭😂
I'm acticualy Irish and nothing annoys me moor than a bad Irish accent
This is delightful and informative!!
American: frost bite Irish: fros'butt
Me after reading title: *impossible*
@jacksepticeye please watch deep Louisiana cajun accents. They're hilarious
The Irish People Try channel has some women with accents that just...  Goodness.
8:08 it’s Irish gman
I'm playing a DnD character that I decided was Irish since I named him Podrick. It's ridiculously hard to find a tutorial on any Irish accent that sounds accurate because they all are so different.
Waiting for a boondock saints reaction now
Oh my god, all these real and fake accents are making my brain play hopskotch in my head... I can taste the pot o' gol' an' it tastes like magenta.
Frostbit not FROSTBAART
Wicklow >>>>>>>> Other counties
watching this literally feels like having a stroke oh my
Noglas Irish accent is better uwu I know what I said and I ain't scared
When I was watching this I was like “ WHAT  THE FUCK DOES THIS MEAN” but I do respect the Irish culture and accent don’t get me wrong
Cause I say mirror with 15 r’s 😭😭😭
A couple years ago I went over to Bannow,  County Wexford, with my parents as that was where my nan was from and I had never visited before. One day we met a farmer who my parents knew, as they had been over many times before I was born. No word of a lie I could not understand him! He was exactly like the farmer in the video. Maybe all the farmers just have the super thick accents? I would love to go back and see more of the country. It was sunny for the entire week we were there and we found a third cousin who worked in the chipper! :)
Christopher Walken: I just want to be..........Irish
Bruh where was "Hiyaaaaaa" from the Cork accent
I find it funny native English speakers can't understand Sean's accent. It seems pretty clear to me.
Shaun does the best impression of Christopher Walker doing an Irish, I've ever heard
Jack, I’m from Armagh, my nana was from Kerry and I’m 16 yet I still can’t understand her when we visit her in Enniscrone Co. Sligo
Some of these are really easy to understand I'm irish so it might seem easy but the rowers from cork unless you speak a whole different language they arent too hard to understand
Come for the games stay for the accent
DUDE, Dude, dude. I don't know if you know Mrs. Browns Boys show but it's great! The first time I saw it I was howling with laughter my guy!🤣🤣😂 Please react to it on your channel
Is it weird that I could understand the farmer before Jack translated?.... lol
Yup the Sligo bays
9:10 I feel like the reason it's so hard to understand, is because they're trying to speak in a way where they barely have to move their mouth :p
I'm so glad jack watched a video from Facts! I'd so love for him to cameo in one of the videos of their new channel The TRY Channel.
Listening to the farmer with auto-subtitles on is the funniest shit
Don’t be shy say which limerick college you went to
I love that Seán watched the exact same video as Kevin did a while back and did the exact same joke about Irish news lmao
i just fecking love being irish
I was on a water ride called Pluto's Barge at Universal Park in Orlando, and my wife and I was on it with three guests from Ireland.  Not a word did I understand.  I'm guessing they must have come from somewhere similar to the shepherd in the video.  It was interesting.  I used to pub crawl with a fool from Manchester when I lived in Chicago, so I thought I was fairly versed in thick accents...  Nope.
6:44 have a good dragon . Fortnite . And moonshine . thats what i can hear
Horrendous Irish accents: *cough cough Kerry
I have an exam in a couple hours
I think it’s crazy that he can actually understand that farmer😂😂
Seán! You should make videos about Irish culture and history from time to time, I’d love to see it!
*1 Man, 100 Accents*
10:00 Music of an Irish accent, huh lass? I may not be the worldliest of gentlemen, but I shall think I've heard more opus from the backend of the cow than admonished by ere tart.
There needs to be more of this! I love accents, all of them!
Your Irish accent is the best UwU
My genes: is mostly different countries (I don't remember the specifics) Me: understands most of the words that are being spoken (I'm 3 or 4 percent irish)
im sorry to laugh at this but sounded like he said "Frostbutt" lmao
Thank you Seán for translating the farmer video because I was struggling.
Sean I’m a 12 year old boy that is from Ireland and I am 5 foot 6
This reminds me of a certain unas annus vid
I'm terrified of being around Irish people (as much as I love the accent) because I have such a neutral accent myself and I also can't help parroting whatever accent I happen to hear a lot of so I'm worried they'd think I'm taking the piss
This should just be a daithi de nongla video
We love the irish content!! Also did Séan go to UL??!
Me watching the news video about  the Irish man losing his sheep ????????? What's he on about lol
Tiocfaidh a lá
The school boy at 8:00 looks like he has the face of a who from the Jim Carrey's Grinch.
Awesome!!!!!!!#!!!!!!!!!!!
Web site: Irish is the most sexy language in the world Irish people: Wel I fund shome sheps ento ze county Me: ¿Y el español qué? Españita, yo si te quiero.
As an Argentinian living in Ireland I can tell you this, you guys waste a lot of air when you pronounce Ts 😆 Also, you change Us for Os, Like in fun or done 🙉
Any of y'all remember that one time when Ethan tried to out-Irish Jack?
2:35- That horse's Irish accent was _horrible._
When yr Irish and u can understand it. :D
Seán should do a video trying to do the different American accents.
SEÁN!! react to newfie people, we can be hilarious sometimes when our accents are thick.
Okay but for real: Irish voices are sexy. I’ve always loved your voice, so when I first met my boyfriend and heard his Irish accent...My heart melted.
I'm Irish. I sound british. Fuck.
You either love or hate an Irish accent, and if you hate it you're wrong!
I've been watching u since I was 4 and I have been watching u for 6 years pls notice me
I honestly can't even consciously attempt to mimic an accent. But ship me somewhere for a year and I'll likely have picked up the local accent. I feel like my natural accent just comes more from my environment rather than where I grew up. Which is weird for me to think about. Like a few years back I spent some time in Germany and by the time I flew back home I sounded very german. And its not intentional at all. It just happens.
Part two please!
Jack all ways finds content.
The only quote I understood of the deep Irish man was 45 sheep missing and that’s it
Waaaaaaaay way back in the day I took a clandestine two-hour lunch break on a Friday to see Snatch with coworkers.  Shhhhhhh...  (Apparently Brad's Traveller was very impressive to Irish coworker.  Who was not a Traveller so might not be the authority.  God that was a lovely day)
Top of the morning was your first words on your golf video from a year ago
The video is over and I’m still waiting for him to laugh at Cameron Diaz’ accent in gangs of New York.
I thought the whole point of Brad Pitts character in Snatch was to play not just plain Irish, but specifically an Irish Gypsy who I think they even said in the movie spoke "not english, nor irish" or something to that effect, like the whole idea was that the gypsies had kind of evolved a language of their own that was just supposed to be kinda weird. From that perspective at least I think he pretty much nailed it.
Wait which Ireland side is he at?
My legs are like jelly  And so is my accent
yo! some of these dudes i swear they sound bajan, too!
Always adored an Irish accent, so this video was heaven to me
Is it just me or does the Irish guy with the  mad ascent sound like a sim character 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
There was an irish guy that traveled to my country we throw a party for some foreigners and he got drunked and OMG i was in "ULTRA INSTINCT" mode try to figure it out what is he telling me ...
Kinda hoped that there would have been the scene from wreck it Ralp 2, When Merida talks :D
Easiest way to have an irish accent, say the following phrase: Whale, Oil, Beef, Hooked 😂
did that guy ever get his sheep back? ;o;
I'm from Donegal used
Can we talk about the "I'm just enjoying myself now"? 😂 14.58
i study linguistics and this video makes me absolutely happy
im happy that at least im under the man himself jack in the sexiest accent
Accents are awesome lol 😅
Nah its kinda annoying when ppl do Irish ascents cause we don't really have and ascent we just say things funny we don't speak like junkies
Is it just me or does he look fucking old
I e never cringed so hard
listen to wild mountain thyme by the longest johns. their songs unlocked the Irish in me
I’m from Cork and I love when my aunts and uncles talk cus it’s so funny
Hey jack i dont no if you no this or not but there was an irish movie made a few years back that had a young lad in it that needed subtitles cos they wanted foreigners to understand him
This is great
I have Irish blood in me but i cannot do an Irish accent I feel as if I have let Ireland down
Irish, Scottish, and Australian accents really make me act up
Canadian plus Irish accents, don't mix very well, eh
awww I have origin's in Ireland but I'm not exactly an irishman I have a mixed accent between a New Zealander and an Irish accent
The most sexiest is Corpse's
I don't think you know what irish sounds like. That trailer was irish as fuck
"Da ya like DAUGS?"
four steps for an Irish accent 1 say whale  2 say oil 3 say beef 4 say hucked
Tbf to Brad Pitt in Snatch, its mostly meant to be a piss-take. He’s intentionally over-doing it, and its genius.
What about the series Derry Girls, is it a realistic accent?
Why can I understand these farmer xD I'm german and not even that fluet in english
it's basically the same for every country. for example many people think Austrians speak German but there's worlds between all the different dialects. hell, even i as a native  have a hard time understanding the people  from the next village... like go find an old farmer and good luck with understanding that xD
Tried turning on subtitles, they just stopped
They Just sound like Arnold Schwarzenegger
Great video spdicey want more of these
The american government after hearing oilland 👁👄👁
This video just makes me want more Misadventures of the Irish Lads.
As a non native english speaker... FUCK.
Is it just me or have Sean’s eyes been pollinated
Limerick accent = nogla
What a accent that guy his and that boy I am irish but I can't believe that old guy had that accent the boy one I can understand but no the old man
Irish content is the best content!
I wouldn’t even know what brad Pitt was saying if there were no subtitles lmao
“WHAT THE FUCK JEFF?”  Quote of 2020!
Sean: Irish people don't say that (Top of the Morning). And every time people ask me to say that, I say "Oh no, it's just cringy now."  Said the guy who named his coffee company Top of the Morning.
"Why dont they just cast an irishman"  ikr. Why can't they just cast an Australian???. You yanks and Brits know you can't do our accent, but you alllways try
Or maybe ur not Irish enough.
‘Brad Pitt, you’re lucky you’re gorgeous’ - an entire mood,
my best accent is Jacksepticeye's video "I Opened A NETHER Portal In Minecraft - Part 4" at 12:20. a sheer Gaelic gladiator there.
The Irish farmers accent is not an accent. It's an entire different language. Change my mind.
Póg mo thóin
React to David McPhail
I basically understood everyone who was actually Irish perfectly but the farmers which I had like 25% comprehension.
AYYYY I LIVE IN SKIBBEREEN SUCH A HORRIBLE TOWN
Now an Irish accent is stuck in my head. I really enjoy listening to different accents. The Irish ones are one of my favorites.
Ima vowel bender
Iam from Ireland
Jack:"get fucked italy" Me: *sad italian noise*
Hot Fuzz! My favourite Edgar Wright film :)
"the T sound is always like an SH sound"  Well that's a shwissh. [Twist]
Thank God he translated what they were saying. I could understand a few words here and there and get the idea from context clues but it was hard to put together. Hahaha.
Trying to get 100 comments on Sean’s channel
She's not from Kerry
Accept Jesus as the Son of God. According to the Bible, all Christians who recognize Jesus as the Son of God are able to be saved.  Read about Jesus’ death on the cross to understand salvation. In the Bible, God sends Jesus to Earth so that he can die and absolve humanity of original sin.  Devote yourself fully to God in everything you do. ... If your confuse just do this if you want to be saved do this repent  know that you are a sinner , believe  that Christ  died for you for your sins  and That God raised him from the dead  on the third day . If you believe it  with all your heart all your soul and all your mind you will be saved by  The Holy's of Holy's.  Amen 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
the one around 5:43 sounds close to Japanese
Conor McGregor has the best accent
The fact that you didn't touch on Norman Reedus in boondocks saints made me sad.
“Just cast Irish people”  *Jamie Dornan jus chillin there playin with shit*
I came into this vid for content. I came out Irish ☘️
Irish accents are awesome i could listen to them everyday yet wouldn't understand most of them lol
I get like the first 10 words or so and then it just plummets to I dont even know lol
Yes I'm from Kerry
Music you call it “MUSIC” okay
This was hilarious!
I'm Irish this is bad
I could just watch the Spedicyman do this all day.
Jack do a video where u get different people from every county and u talk to them and ask for them to talk in their accent
My Favorite Irish accent is your accent and Daithi De Nogla’s accent
Being able to understand a heavy Irish accent is like being able to read morse code.
Do more Irish videos. I love accents, all accents so please do more
Didn’t call me Kevin do this?
5:29 I forgot for a minute that that he said he was speaking it in an  accident when I heard this Irish men's accent oh God I thought it was a language
I can already imagine a Karen yelling at these guys, telling them to talk English
Seán's revenge for the colour dots.
Now I dont think I have an Irish accent but whenever I talk to someone they always say are you Irish. If I meet someone in ireland they always know I'm from cork
I think this was my favorite video ever
Im so proud to be of heritageeeee💕💕💕💕 so wish I was 20000000000% Irish damnnnn ittt
It’s kind of like southern accents, North Carolina is different from Mississippi, which is different from Louisiana, which is different from Texas, which is different from Montana. I always find it funny when people are talking about Louisiana shit in a Virginian accent.
O! U bastard! U cut off as soon as they were gunna talk about Northern Ireland 😂
Hey Jack you should play the old GOW games on the channel
okay
Wait a second, are you telling me that Sean has gray hairs????
I haven't watched jack in a while why tf does he look like an old skeleton i know he ain't 21 but jesus
This is one of the best videos in a while lol. Thanks Jack!
i love how me along with all other irish ppl watching this defo tried to see if they didnt sound as scuffed as the rest of these fellas
Jack, SUPERLIMINAL!!!
Omg. Tom cruise in far and away!
I wish I was Fork Ireland rather than my family came from there
Shawn, why can’t I get you coffee in Australia... I got so excited when the cold brew was in stock 😭
Mup Skibbereen
The how to do an Irish accent video is on my birthday
Howdy sean could you please review the animated children's movie song of the sea I love it. It's based on irish/celtic filk lore it's also set in ireland
Just me or people from northeast Tennessee sound about the same as the sheep guy? I could understand him fairly well. 😄👍
Seann silver fox??
I’m mad that he didn’t look at the Boondock Saints. Like just why ?! I was SEARCHING for Norman Reedus why wasn’t he there ?!?!?! 😫😫😫
There's a character in Assassin's Creed Valhalla that I think is meant to be Irish.  When she speaks even the subtitles just say (unintelligible)
I am Irish and I still didn't understand a thing the farmer who had his sheep stolen said
When ever the guy whose sheep were stolen said dog my captions thought he said dragon
This is the most fun I have had watching a video in a while
this lady also spittin bars
This just reminds me of when and American came up to me and said they could do a British accent and I asked which one .....           They didn't know there was more than one accent???
Every time I use Siri it can’t understand my accent ( I’m Scottish) i need to do my best American accent Is it just me
The sheep video sounds more swedish than irish to me :D
Videos like this make me really  proud to be irish
Cork is the scouse of Ireland
Holy be to the jaysus, this vid just would make every Irishman laugh at our own race and even more by trying to listen to others speak like us 🤣
I feel like Jack's accent is similar to when I, a Texan, go to visit other Texan family members with a heavier accent and come back with a right proper Texan accent.
Loved it!
Connell from normal people though 👀
Doctor:you have osteoporosis  Me:what should i do Doctor:drink some more milk bitch
With my accent mirror terns to mirr
Kinda sounds like German where he says " muss man wolken machen"
i understood most of it but I could NOT for the life of me replicate or translate it in actual words. How does that work????
0:53 did he say herb as herb? Isn’t the h silent? Idk I’m American so
Jack can you please play Minecraft again
That 'kerry' accent is not a kerry accent, ill do a far better job aha
I felt the same way with the english dialects in BLy manor, I couldn't take it completely seriously
Please review more!
IRELAND
I love your Irish/Ireland related videos, but at some point word just turn to mush and I feel like my American accent is dying.
Honestly when the horse got hit in the bum I thought Sèan was going to say " SPANK DAT ASS!"
Ah jasus jack what are ya doin
@GaelForceAudios if you think Irish accents are unattractive Gael will change your mind ✨COMPLETELY✨
I wish he reacted to a certain pair of youtubers that are dead now rest in peace their souls
As an American who had to do an Irish accent for a play (which, I might add since it’s fitting for the video, was because I was a *sexy Irish nurse* so...sexiest accent in the world indeed) and failed *miserably* at it...yeah, they are pretty hard to do if it isn’t naturally developed. Gotta respect the people that can do them well, natural or not.  Anyways, I really enjoyed this video. I’m always fascinated by different accents and dialects because there are so many. Like Jack said, as an American (while still having an American accent) I have a *rural* Pennsylvanian dialect, which is completely different from the city accents or the accents our Amish have...because Pennsylvania has a lot of Amish people btw. And comparing that to say, a New York accent, it’s like night and day (I mean, again, comparing it to a Pittsburgh/city Pennsylvanian accent there are huge differences.) idk, it’s just really cool. Humans are cool beings!
Your accent has been completely understandable for my American ears.  DAITHI THOUGH...!
Built different 🥶 🥶 🥶 🥶 🥶 🥶
Jack watching dipshit McGee butcher his language kills me
Give us another Irish accent video I lived it
Now all the irish appear
I'mma be honest, before I found this channel I had no idea what an Irish accent could sound like, let alone what Irish people actually say, so just about every single accent featured in this video is absolutely magical to me. I'm surprised I can understand as much as I do (which isn't much but it's something ain't it?)
Understood everything the lad with the “mad accent” have some experience with understanding strong Irish accents a hard one is trying to understand a Donegal man talking fast
When sèan was saying mean things about languages, when he stopped at Australian I smiled  I’m Aussie btw
“and leave a comment to which accent you loved the most” Hmmmmm lemme thinkk....i liked irish the best😂😂 ahhh jack you say the best things😂👍🏽
I've been watching you for about 4 5 years and you finally get some white hair.
Brad Pitt’s accent is absolutely spot on for English-Irish travellers. He sounds exactly like half my family.
Check out Norman Reedus doing one in Boondock Saints!! 🤭
My familial Irish blood flowing through my very Canadian veins is actually allowing me to understand pretty much 80% of what's being said. Mad.
Sean translating made me feel like I was in a real life movie scene and it felt like I was also having a stroke
Hey where the fuck is the hat?
So to be fair, that lady wasn’t wrong. She’s teaching an Irish accent! Just not a specific one
Corks favourite Liverpool fan
The fact that Kevin gave blue screen at translating the same kerry accent video sends
What's the difference between a Scottish and Irish accent
Some of these sound like Newfie accents 😂
Listen to a junkies accent from North Dublin and then tell me if Irish accents are still sexy 😂
I’m Irish and I’m proud 😂😂🇮🇪🇮🇪🇮🇪
Sean Is right about the "American" Accent, there's so many different ones, some of which are only found in ONE STATE ONLY, i.e. Chicago, California, and North/South Virginia. Then you have the typical Southern Accent from Texas and the states around it. The "Accent" most would think about would be the North-Eastern States, which sound Quote, "Normal" (NOT COUNTING DETROIT DIALECTS).
"Im fuckin good at this" I died
Day 5 of getting famous off yt comments
I don't get it. Maybe it's because I'm from the north of England and had a heavy accent myself at one point, but all of this was easily understandable to me.
I fecking luved itsh
The world news:  talk about Covid-19  Ireland news: My sheep gone missin
So Which county is Jack from then?
Christopher Walken is so badass that he doesn't even need to have a good Irish accent. The late great Sean Connery (RIP) didn't have a Russian accent when he did Hunt For Red October, but he was still badass just speaking with his usual Scottish accent.
Jack should do just a video where he just talks in his Irish accent 😂 it would be so cursed and no one would know what’s he’s saying
The lads from Cork were so feckin easy to understand. Mad that ppl from out of Ireland wouldny understand them.
My mind just exploded lmao. As someone who's first language isn't English this was so fun and strange at the same time.   Idk if it's just for me, but understanding jack is easier than understanding someone who only speaks english.  love u jack 😂😂 and ur way of speaking is so beautifuuul
I'm just going to watch Derry Girls and repeat after them.
The cork one is so true
Can there be a part 2 to this please?
But where is Jack from?
In the Bahamas we say oil like erl
Brad Pitt’s accent is apparently a very specific regional accent. Some professional accent dude analysed it and said it’s actually spot on
No you are banned from ireland after this
Well, as Jason Statham's character says in the movie "he spoke with a weird accent, not scottish, not irish.. just.. pickey"
I think you'd make a good pirate with the way you say "hard" lol
Will you ever play Mario & Sonic at the olympic games.
To be honest, i can understand most of it. Idk if its bc I'm part Irish or I just have good language skills, but I can :p
I now see why my dad says lover instead of loaver
Brad Pitt isn’t doing an Irish accent so to speak, it’s stereotypical ‘Pikey’ which is like this weird In between. One of the lines narrated in one scene is ”it’s not Irish, it’s not English, it’s just well...It’s just Pikey” describing the obscure accent :)
I was bron with a irisch accent LoL
Chic be like oilland
I understood the caravan one perfectly lol
Your man with the plastic bag on his head is one of the rubberbandits, a limerick treasure
I'm learning English and usually I understand about 80-70 % of what jack says  This video the ratio dropped to 20 %
There's an interview with the cast of Once Upon a Time (from years ago... like a comic con interview or something) where Colin O'Donoghue and Robert Carlisle start talking to each other in their real accents and they are so hard to understand.
The sheep guy sounded like he was talking while being rewinded
I swear to god, Sean is getting more and more Irish every fucking video XD
How the fuck did australian get 5th
I’m Irish and I can tell all of those were bolox
“ I’ma vowel bender” 😂
i think the vocal couch might have been for music, and in music accents are different to fit music better
Fun fact: I clicked this video Bc jack was wearing a cool hoodie in the thumbnail and he’s not even wearing it in the video. Disappointment. (Still a good video tho)
i just moved to the US a few months ago from Cork Ireland. and the people i’ve met who try to do our accent 🤦‍♀️
the first two Irish-men talking to each other be like: Oi M8 how 'bout we tolk in a way no human bein could understand us
Why is it called Irish accent. It's clearly another language.
God I miss home so much 😭 came to England for Uni and Im dying to go back to Belfast
JACK, Im from kerry and understood this farmer,  but if you really want an accent hard to understand, look up sham from killarney, that man has some accent but only an elite few lads know what aul sham says
Hi Jacksepticeye!
5:36 all i heard was Bright out in the moring
As soon as I saw the Irish school boy one I cheered. I'm from Northern Ireland and my friend used to get the bus to school with him He put the accent on for this interview but still, I love it so much. Its so funny We just watch it every so often
Please make scp #3
Sean: h-a-che
@Jacksepticeye love your videos SPEED IS KEY!
😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😂😂😂😂😂😂
Am i the only one who sees jacks eye shadow and has a problem with it?
You should watch Jeff Dunham’s Irish Baby skit
"I'm so tired of every Hollywood movie doing British accents regardless of the movie's setting." enter stage left, Wild Mountain Thyme. "Okay I see the problem now."
Jack should do a video teaching us the accent 🇮🇪
no he is not speaking english thats a different language like celtic or some shit that sheep farmer on something i couldnt understand anything except when he said it was bright  JEEZ
Jack, When are you gonna play Among Us with Syykuno and Corpse and the rest of the Gang again??
That's okay I love you videos I have been watching you since your first video ever
Sean i had fun also lol
Long time ago I was working in a warehouse and we were storing U2 merchandise. A fella showed up and asked to check on it. His accent was really tough to understand.
Jacky are those grey hairs or is it just the lighting ?? 🥺
The County Louth accent is like Swedish southern Stockholm accent.
This was a really fun video!!! 🥰
I wouldn't call that farmer ''Bo Peep''. More like ''O'Peep.''
Can someone tell me how accurate the accents in Derry Girls are? Yeah I know they’re Northern Irish but still
I liv up in donegal and I coud hardly undirstand thee Irish
Lol, Jamie Dornan is Irish tho
As an American, I have to say that Sean's accent sounds very clean to me.  He's definitely got a recognizable Irish accent, but I can still understand every word he says.  He'd do very well in voice acting.
My accent changes because I mixed my parents accent together, My dad toppled and started laughing, spitting out Irish insults with a smile. my mom just looked at me, I barely understood him. I can read Irish Gaelic, but not speak it very much.
Anyone else understand all of the heavy accent even thought they aren’t Irish?
Videos like this make me jealous that accents in the North aren’t like this 😔
jack learned some words from dani "Milk"
The hot fuzz reference was spot on😂
Who already heard of the mad accent from a nas daily video
This is like Kevin’s video!
Jack says no one in Ireland says top o’ the morning when he is wearing his top of the morning coffee shirt
Don't want to get that frostbutt
I LOVE IRISH ❤❤❤😅
Vocal coach: "Oiland" Jack: "Ireland" HAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!!
The main policeman in the peaky blinders had a fine irish accent .
the devil came in jack at 2:00
@jacksepticeye there is a new bendy and the ink machine coming soon called bendy and the ink machine and the dark revival i don't know the release date but ill let you know when it is
For fuck sake 😂 try and get a video of "Wisconsineese" accent.
This whole video rememberd me about how I learned how to prenounce llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch... Its a real village in Wales, and the writing is Welch.
Jack.... why would you expose Limerick to the world like that! We had just about gotten rid of that nickname ffs! Dunno if we'll let you back in the county after that now...
The fella at the end with e knife is one of the rubber bandets
I went to Cork and my answer to everyone was “What??!”. Then a bus driver told me “I’m not talking slower you’re going to have to think faster.” I just did a lot of nodding after that. Love this video!
JACK I LOVED WHEN YOU INTERPRETED THE STRONG ACCENTS ISHXKSHS
Scotland 🤝 Ireland
Actually the thing I love the most to hear form Jack is "I dont know GHUUHHWHY" I have no igua how he sais it but I love it
Sean watch the angry scotsman
“Music.” More like a babbling brook.
It’s funny cos some of these kind of sound like the Doric accent here in Scotland so I can kind of understand some of it 😂🤣😂 also 12:15 it’s the same in Scotland, there’s a few different Scottish accents out there not just the one
If you don't pronounce the letter h like "haech" then you aren't the one for me
Bro what the hell that man was literally like safdhugseyuvbseuyg that is what it fucking sounded like!!!! (the old man with the sheep)
Jack I think you should just start recording random things and having fun and just hanging out personally I love that kind of content and I sure it’ll bring many more viewers Idk tho you’re the one with the giant channel haha but if you see this just an idea
19:10 as a person from cork I can confirm that this is true and I actually know A LOT people who do it to that extreme!😂
Now I know why I say "mirrrrr" when trying to say mirror. Grew up in a Scottish household in Texas. The combo of me mum's soft scottish accent and me growing up in america made me sound "Irish" according to family that would visit from overseas.
As someone living in Kerry lemme tell you not even people in Kerry know what people in Kerry are ever talking about, we can't understand each other anymore than you can
why when watching the old farmer i think im hearing a anime?
Sgt Ducky's accent cracks me up aswell as all other accents from Ireland. I'm from Ireland and I don't think mines thick.
Best video in a while!
Level 1 Seán accent : Fuck off will you?! Level 2 Seán accent : Feck off will ya?! Level 3 Seán accent : Feck off will ye'!  Level 4 and beyond Seán accent : FEC' OF' WI' YE'?!
It all started with a certain Unus Annus video
My nan moved from Ireland to England when she was 20, 50 years down the line she still sounds like she lives there, lol. She can't shake the Kerry accent no matter how hard she tries
random, but if u listen to a Cornish it just sounds like ur on drugs and can make out anything
yeah it was fun, so thanks man
I realize Seán’s Irish, but I would love nothing more than to see him react to funny Scottish tweets, ‘cause those are pure gold
That Jeff dude was just Thirsty
Jack never likes my comments 😢 still he my fave  YouTuber
What's the craic, gwan, gway Gwan so
I was born in belfast
This guys accent is like if gnomes had there own language.
Flash back to that one Unus Annus accent video
Jesus christ I'm from Skibbereen !!! Didn't know those lads, well done to them
Last year I had an anthropology lecturer that was Irish and she played us a video about some part of Irish history (can't quite remember what it was) and it was an Irish guy speaking about whatever it was inside a prison or something and I think I understood about one or two words maximum. I was losing my shit. I was like is everyone else hearing English right now because??? what?? is happening??? the lecturer was nodding along like uh huh, yup, this dude is making good points. I was so stressed out.
Wasn't Philippines top 1?
Since I was young I’ve always pronounced t in the middle or end of the word slightly more like a d I’m the only person where I’m from that does that and it sounds just like you were describing I was raised in Tennessee
I like hearing "That chapter" say 3rd, thirty, and just 3 in general
Gotta get back with the lads Shaun
Evidently the "South" in any country makes it's own sounds as they go along (I'm in the South of the US).
Why is seán such a good youtuber
Currently eating 💩👍 0:26
Sean: *Explaining how there's no one Irish accent and that the accent changes even city to city* Also Sean: *in response to a Southern English sounding accent* "sHE sOUNds bRitISH"
As an Irish girl I'm not allowing you back into Ireland
“The Irish Account voted Sexiest in the world”  Corpse Husband: *complete Sub to Jack* 😂
Me and my Scottish accent: sawd scodish noyzes
A vowel bender I cant EVEN!
Ye gotta check out our Newfoundland accents, bloody brilliant they are
Is Sean getting grey hair??
I used that "how to do an irish accent" video when I was trying to create an irish dnd character 😭
Its funny that i understand them haha... Hon Cork!!
"Start drinkin' more milk, BITCH" -J'Sean 2020 😂
Thos rowers are probably from cork lol 😂  Edit: they where I knew it 😀
Why have I never noticed the similarities between the Irish and jamaican accent up until now
ALRIGHT....Who pissed in Jacks cornflakes this morning? Who added  the salt? You should be ashamed, doing my boy that way.😂
LOL - the news clip wasn't THAT bad - Richie's last comment cracked me up "Whoever's doing it knew what the fuck he's doing." Basically the lads just talked fast and mumbled a bit.
I under stood every single word
This is EXACTLY what it feels like when some one tries to imitate a russian accent.
What's your thought on the films Boondock Saints?? I think Sean does a good Irish Accent but Norman on the other hand to me it sounds like he slips into a strange Irish cross Scottish, special in the Courtroom Scene at the end of the first film lol
0:41 Sean milk gang? Anyone else milk gang
I surprisingly understood a most of this😂.
Whot da fock Jeff 🤣
I want to be a YouTuber 😘
I think I just about died listening to these accents
Better title, Irish man tries to do Christopher Walken trying to be irish
People trying to do southern united states accents are always terrible also
Is it weird that when i heard some of these people talk i get the feeling of talking to a nice old man or nice old lady?
Me an irishman could not understand him
Me enjoying my milk: 🙂🥛 Jack saying milk is for children:😥🥛
That awkward moment when a real Irishman does a better Christopher Walken impression than Christopher Walken does a real Irishman impression...
Jack has to watch american southerners and see if he can understand a bit of it. when I moved out in the middle of nowhere from a big city, I couldn't understand a single thing anyone was saying, It was a bit of trip at first to say the least.
maybe those unsubscribed viewers are just your subscribed ones from another device
Omg I'm playing River City Girls and I don't expect Jacks voice to be the potential creep in the game that's awesome
my ma has some people that she works with and they speak in such a strong accent nobody can understand a single word
Midwesterns also say mirror as meer
English:  Iron - Ayorn Irish: Iron - Arn
as i was typing the hot fuzz reference sean made the reference that why this channel is the best
I dont think you can say much you lost your accent years ago
the lady : pairk, gairden jack : PAIRK!! GAIRDEN!!!!!
petition for jack to do a vlog where he goes back to the cabin in the woods (or where it was) and have the nostalgia hit.
Bitch, how tf is an American meant to get a joke about Bandon?😂😂😂 Also the brit talking about shillings, we haven't used em here since like the 90's haha
I enjoyed this throughly.
(2019) 0:25 But is still my favourite either way.
And I know a lot of people probably say this to you but I love you dude I've been watching it Channel since I was like 5 and I'm 11 and I I really want you to respond. I know you're probably not going to but it's fine
I really like that kind of video! I laughed and I learnt sth new :D
Brad Pitt was supposed to be hard to understand.
Everything changed when the consonants attacked
When are you going to restock the shoes cuz I'm looking to buy a hoodie a Sam plushie a phone case and a pair of Converse
Good’ol Mike over here kinda sounds Norwegian like from Trondheim... i’m from there btw
HE PRONOUNCED HERB LIKE HERB- IT'S PRONOUNCED LIKE "ERB" 😭
Cork is the best accent so ya
Jesus, Jack! I thought you'd know he meant Julia Roberts from the Michael Collins movie! Thought that was a given. 😂 And the Limerick lad with the bag on his head and the knife is Blindboy from Rubber Bandits!!
Ohh the mountains are breathing close
my friends dont let me do the Irish accents any more except if I'm speaking Irish and now I can subject them to this
yeah what the fuck jeff, get your shit straight
thats Right!! totally Agree, sexiest most attractive accent ever!!! idc if I don't understand.. when I start flirtatiously giggling uncontrollably (aka in almost ALL of jacks older videos back in his cabin years)  I'm just  a sack of potato's in jacks hands >.> ..... IM INNOCENT i SWEAR... (edited after the end of a video) yup Jack you just made me turn into a sack of potato's now damn it!!!  my BF tried to pull off his "Scottish" accent on me (when he is only 10%) and its clear its fake and just not Irish.. ITS NOT THE SAME!!! Jack gives me my Irish FIX.
I luv frostbite kid
I’m Irish but I don’t have an Irish accent so yeah 🤠
Come back to us jack for the love of the baba jayzus
I love how the frostbit guy sounds like he's saying, "Frosht-butt".
just don't attempt English lol
2:20 despicable me gru
am i the only person who heard "fortnite"  he must be an epik gamer
I think the greatest accent I heard today was yours Sean(sorry Idk how to do the thing on the a). its really not the accents that make Irish people so appealing its the personality! ;)
please-- please do more irish stuff.. it so funny :D  like a dialect tour of Ireland
I’m from Scotland and can understand ever word in all these videos
I didn't know about that movie until you started talking about it lol.
Dye your hair green please
I was hoping to hear an Athlone accent , miss it so much :((
Really wish you'd have looked at Norman Reedus in The Bookdock Saints cause that's... that's a tough one.
Jack is a great Irish lad I glad to learn this language
MOTHER IRELAND
The man who speaks mad Irish sound like me when I first couldn’t talk English and I just spat out random shit out of my mouth that exactly how it sounds for me
Far cry primal pls 😁
Don’t worry Jack — I love Ireland and I can’t wait for the chance to come back 😂💕
haha i'm lactose intolerant jack...
So basically, Irish accent = drunk British with lots of "shh"
And I thought u where  Swedish like Gordon Ramsay( y am I wired) does anyone else see Seán with grey hairs.... Seán is old now
Ngl, Sean's Christopher is great
Can you do the top off the morning again som time
18:36 Jesus Christ this is a great meme template! You're welcome...
So um... here before a million views. I'm gonna be buried in a few minutes...
Don't worry Jack, when you say mirror in the north it's just mrrrrrrrr - no vowels for us 🤣🤣🤣
Today I've learned that Ireland is similar to Scotland except the further North of Scotland you go the harder it is to understand what is actually being said.
I love the accent that says "perfect"
This makes me feel like I never learned how to speak English (English is my second language)
also i'm pretty sure the new zealand accent got rated the sexiest last year and as a new zealander i question this scale lmaooo
I want Jack to listen to some of Guy Martin's older interviews. I know he's not Irish, but his accent is so strong!
I'm an Irish descent does that count
Gypsy doesn't mean Irish.
Jack you need to go back to the OG intro please ... Top of the morning to your ladies
Christopher Walken as an Irishman is my new favourite thing.
ok so can we have an episode of LAUGH entirely in Sean's Irish accent with subtitles plz
Every Irish person has said wats the craic wey ye
*flashback to Unus Annus*
I feel like its normal for ppl to love their first languages' accent/dialect, cuz i 100% went through that. I'm Puerto Rican, grew up in the States, and finally started getting back into my language and it just feels so comfy to hear it. Idk how to explain it but I wanna surround myself by Ricans again :)
This is so shit as a fellow Irish man
that sheep farmer accent sounds like a whole different language
Thought I had watched enough Father Ted to be able to understand the Farmer Mikey's accent...  I was wrong 😔🤘.
That brad pitt bein an irish gypsy tho does that change anything ?
me starts video, hears no wpshh *Cries*
sean talking about mirror becoming mirrrrr, my history teacher was irish and could never say terrorist or anything with the word terror in it, would always just be terrrrr, not very good as she was teaching us about the troubles 😬
look let me say something i was gonna tell a story so one time i was in fortnite and there was three irish people talking and one of them knew how to speak an english accent and than all i would,ive heard is heyfh i,amch irish haha lol xd it,s so funny.
TRY THE FINNISH ACCENT YOU WONT
You should react to Calvary with Brendan Gleeson
If you can learn to understand a county kerry native, you can understand the world!
I'm Finnish, but when I lived in UK people kept complimenting me on my lovely Irish accent 😳 I have no idea how that happened but I got multiple compliments on it.
Im sure u read this but duh jacks accent was the best out of this whole video
You should have done Sean from red dead redemption 2, he has an pretty heavy irish accent, it isnt that mumbly doe but it shure is heavy
Ok this is very random and trust me it's not a lie but I am related to Micheal Collins,no joke. He is my great grandmothers 2 nd  cousin so that's pretty cool. Anyways ya I'm related to probably the biggest irish hero of all time
Thank was brillaint ahahahahaha coybig
Oh bloody these accents arrrr da best
Ok Sean, you can speak Irish, but can you speak English? 😎😎😎😎😎
anyone else feel like he should watch mrs brown boys...
Yo Jack! Do you remember Outer Wilds, the space exploration game you played about a year ago?
To me you sound just grand, I’ve notice in your streams in twitch when you play with the lads your accent gets thicker, but so does Kevin’s, and I just love it! I learnt my english in Ireland, Co. Kildare, and I sure miss it!
Next time Jack should react to other thick accents
When I was a kid, we use to drive down to Florida from Michigan. There were some places where when you stopped the peoples accents were just as thick.  It always made me think about all the different variations of an accent each country had within their borders. Is it like that in Japan? That kind of stuff.
Cork reminds me of the young offenders
Hiya jack I luv ur vids
13:08 I don't mind if your accent gets stronger because I like it...let your accent flow
Turn subtitles on thank me later ☆-☆
That moment when Jack starts to translate that irish farmer and I totaly lose what they both are saying....
this was such a funny video lmaooo
Imagine corpse with an Irish Accent
7:05 Kevin couldn't understand that man so sean is right lmao
Spanish: Fast and spicy words German: Angry and long words French: As fancy as it sounds words Irish: All the words all at once.
I think that some Irish accents and Southern US accents have similar ways of saying things. Like, as Sean said with the word mirror, where I'm from in the US we also say Mirror as mirrrrrr
17:42 when you lie on ur resume but you still get the job XD
Really interesting and entertaining at the same time XD would love to learn more about Ireland and it's culture in this hilarious format with you Sean :P
my dads from belfast but i live in new zealand and no one understands how i am able to understand irish accents 😂
Hey, Seán just found out I'm more Irish than I am British also my middle name is Seán
I have no clue why but I'm Welsh and can understand near to every word they say
“There’s a lot of examples of people trying to do Irish accents that don’t have an Irish accent, and it just sounds absolutely dreadful.” Me: thinks back to [REDACTED] and cry-laughs
2:26   this is just  21 minutes of jack being  the terminator
I am in bed man
Lad I'm irish and I had to like actually listen to this guy and I had no idea what the fuck he was saying.
This cracked me up so much. Loved this, thanks for doing this.
My middle name is Sean didn't know there was a different way to spell it until like a month ago 🤦‍♂️
That's it guys. I already was thinking about it but I've confirmed it now. When I graduate collage I'm moving to Ireland. Does anyone know how hard it is to get citizenship in ireland?
I am Scottish and Irish
The movies are the cringe
OMG. I need to learn to understand that accent xD
try to react at some stereotypes please
Every week I get to watch my Malay Singaporean best friend try to play football with a guy from the south of Ireland, and a bunch of Australians. It's an amazing hour of people screaming "what the f-k are you saying??"  I love it
Wait, is RT Game from South Dublin?
that irish farmers video is how most people sound half the time when they talk to me,,, i love having audio processing issues
Jeff: "i like them, but i don't like their accent" Jack: "BELL OF BURN IT BEFORE IT LAYS EGGS" yes
Cool story: a couple of weeks ago I spoke about the irish accent at lexicology at my university, and I didn't understand a single word from the sheep video, sooo WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN JACK I NEEDED THIS TRANSLATION
That dude at the end is so.......wrong
Jack doesn’t even have an accent
He should have reacted to the young offenders
Jack, you should speak gealic in one of your videos for an intro. You could say top of the mornin' in gealic. Though you probably don't know how to speak gealic.
To be honest, I clicked on the vid out of loyalty for Jack but I actually ended up reeeallly enjoying this like...I'm on the floor laughing kind of enjoying so thanks!
What is the background music??,,
First lad is pretty decent, the ginger is a joke. Brad pitt is good as Irish traveller.
How did Mini Ladd and Jacksepticeye end up playing a couple of the EXACT SAME MEMES? It's so funny
He said frost bite but it liked frost but
Yeah I always wonder, when people generalize something as (select a country/nationality)'s accent. Do they just not have different dialects around the area they're from? Why would it be any different in another country? A different language isn't an all-encompassing accent all the speakers share :D  But do consider: Finnish accent in English.  That's some sexy stuff.  Check out an interview form Kimi Räikkönen if you don't believe me xD
I'm at mid video rn and I hope you reacted to an old man in a pub who had a very thicc accent more difficult to understand than the farmers
That was hella entertaining thank you.
Does Sean golf?
Which Irish accent was voted the sexiest? Like many places there is no one accent spoken everywhere. For example with English accents, the accent in Machester is very different to the accent in London.
12:30 jack it is the same in switzerland. You have normal swiss-german and then every canton has their own version of german
As an Irish person this pains me so much
You mean that isn't what Irish people sound like? :)
I'm from kerry but I have english in me and my parents are from cork so I basically dont have an accent but I do have many neighbours with the deep thicc boi Irish accent and I just love it
The similarities of Irish accent and Australian accent. We both sound piss off our heads
You should hear Canadian accents/dialects...
YOUR ACCENT.💮🌸😊💮🌸
FROSTBIT BOY!!!
Ya like dags Tommy?
I recall watching Call Me Kevin react to some of the same videos, and he couldn't understand them, but Jack actually did, and translated them perfectly. As a result, the title is surprisingly misleading.
American people:"Forty-five"  Irish people: "Farty-five"  Hahaha
Jack trying to be Irish even though hes already Irish sounds like Arnold
5:27 *I SHIT YOU NOT* my uncle talks EXACTLY like this... I'm a Kerry girl but picked up a moderate Essex accent when I lived over there but HOOOOOOLY, Kerry has such an extreme accent.... I love it.
Brad Pitt was the worse what are you talking about :O
Top ah theee morning
Jack: I want to see has many of you can hear what he is saying   What I hear:gjhhacalaketaeflada sheep mieaslaken monkaneta 👁👄👁
People from Kerry realising no one understands them:👁👄👁
I don't even register Sean having an accent anymore
Everybody's Green Street noo how the fuck remember the comedy gold snatch
You should do a video critiquing actors bad accents and actors who do really good accents. Doesn't matter really what accents but i think it would be funny. Maybe do Scottish or English.
0:40 does this mean he's milk gang
I hate when people try to speak in a southern accent
I don’t know what this video turned into either, but I’m enjoying every second of it.
I'm from ireland down the south in cork
I loved this so much!!! Please give us more.
Should’ve pulled an Irish goodbye at the end of the video and just skipped an outro haha.
The most incredible thing to me is that "SEAN MAC AN tSITHIGH" which was presumably fully capitalized for formatting reasons, specifically has that one lowercase "t" in it.  If anyone knows the reason for that, please tell me, I'm very curious.
When he cuts off them talking about Northern Ireland in the end :/ welp I’m definitely not hurt .......
Well i am from germany,i can understand you very well but i didn't understand him a little bit😀
Just feken dont put on a face acent if your not irish
Omg jack please i am begging you please please please play " a plague tale " please jack please
My favourite thing is Irish and Scottish people doing other accents because they absolutely can't hide their native accent properly
My half irish as lived near Cork jezus how did i understand people then
This was so fun to watch :)
Interesting Meme Time format
If Irish is music then it is mumble rap
ahhh an Irish movie staring English actors...... can't get more Irish than that
Is anyone else who’s part Irish, never been to Ireland, get the accent sometimes out of nowhere?
it was a bit more difucult understanding the other counties but it was easy to hear what the cork lads were saying. im from cork so ya
You should play the new assassin's Creed game it has your Ireland in it
I can understand the farmer because I am Irish
I'm amazed Shawn didn't look up Leo de Caprio in Gangs of New York how bad his accent was
They sound scottish
I love the Waterford accent as I’m from there. Also you should do a video on the different counties and what they sound like
I turned on my captions for the Irish farmer and they turned off completely then started spouting random shit 😂 like even my captions went 🤷🏽‍♀️
This ere would be ard to understand but luckily my O Irish last name gives me the irish ears
Wait till he discovers newfies
Which accent you thought was the greatest one or the most interesting one             commenting because you told me to.
4:57 yeeeeees I love that video!! I screamed!! Is so funny the accent of that farmer
this was a great video it would be better  if you did more
The cork accent will forever make me laugh I really don’t know why
Kerry sounded bloody English and I am English and btw the tea thing is not true we actually adore tea💂‍♀️
Jack: *WE DON'T SAY TOP OF DA MORNIN'!!!*  Also Jack: NAMES HIS COFFEE TOP OF THE MORNIN'
As a Bavarian I know how you Irish folks feel the rest of England can't understand you, the rest of Germany can't understand us. Also there is a different dialect every 5 villages  Bavarian: zaus I wett a Hoibe German : servus/hi ich hätte gerne eine halbe/bier English: hi I would like to have a beer
Jack, Shawn baby, you should do a video where you react to us trying to do an Irish accent X'D i think thatd be funy and fun to do since this video now exsists! xp
It's a shame you didn't get to react to "How to speak Dublin" it's such a funny short skit about the accent.
I've watched Jack for so long now he just sounds normal to me 😂😂😂 My brain rarely registers his accent anymore LMAO
Jack needs to hear a Newfoundland accent, the Canadian Irish accent!
you should do Southern American accents next
Love your videos 😍
Jack learns Irish in his free time to get back into his culture: *Normal Brain*  Jack learns Irish on Duolingo and makes videos on it so everyone can also learn the language of the potato: *Big Brain*  Jack makings live stream of learning Irish on Duolingo so that everyone can interact with it: *Ultra Brain*  Jack learning Irish on Duolingo while live-streaming it with the Irish Lads: *Colossal Brain!*       But in all seriousness Jack you don’t have to do this. I just thought of a meme that’s all.
someone: jaberhsiuadof  jack translating: ye so my cows have been taken  me trying to understand: wtf is this shit mate
Irish alexa
Wat up with the shipping it's almost the exact same as the hot chocolate
ah the limerick accent is something special
I really liked the lady from Cork she had such a pretty accent!
When that one guy who lost his sheep started talking, the only thing I heard was sheep, please tell me I'm not alone
I'm irish and I couldn't even understand that Irish sheep guy
Thanks jack your video's are great all the time and you are awesome and amazing 👏 😀
Minx must be from cork
"START DRINKING MORE MILK BITCH" Is my favorite thing ever said by anyone ever now.
Oh naw Seánie boy! Da diff'r'nce 'tween you an' normal Irish people is you articulate we can understand what you're saying because you enunciate each vowel and consonant. Ah but you're still a sound lad!
I'm assuming Aisling Bea is from Cork, because she sounds similar to me.
Love you Jack! Been watching since 900k subs❤️
I bleeding loved this video!
Jack said about hot fuzz before I could, but it is like that when Jack translates
sometimes an accent gets so strong it sounds like a different language.
What about Galway jack
The Lady is forgetting putting a h in front of EVERY s
Where is JustaMinx from?
DIS RANDOM VIDEOS I LOVE !! BRO DO MO
Please anybody that sees this look at foil arms and hoggs guide to dublinese! It's perfect
might be cos im from manchester but the frostbit guy wasnt that bad
some of these people sound like they are speaking a different language
A lot of belly laughs watching this video 🤣
An european accent is not possible because we dont speak the same language.
not Sean understanding every word the farmer said and me sitting here like 👁👄👁. 😑. 👀
Can you rate the Irish accents in Boondock Saints? One of my favorite movies as an American with Irish ancestry.
5:32 why does this whole statement sound like what’s his face from aot?
Wild Mountain Thyme almost seems like Wales
Surprised you didn't talk about Norman Reedus' irish accent in Boondock Saints
The missing sheep guy sounded more welsh to me 🤨
Reasonable nationalism is so wholesome 06:33 how the hell can you understand this 16:14 HAHAHAHAHAHA 17:55 probably because of sexist cultural tradition, am I right feminists wink wink 19:18 HAAAAHAHAH that's fucking amazing 20:38 I love crack!
Been watching you since I was 8 I don’t regret it 😂
The fact Jack didn't recognise that was The RubberBandits at 19:52 breaks my heart 💔😭 F*ck youre Honda civic I've a horse outside!!!!! Whoever sees this comment and your not Irish,  Search "The RubberBandits", Youre welcome🤣
YouTuber watches YouTube videos for YouTube content. Do other accent videos!
Pretty sure, New Zealand has the most sexiest accent title lol
Can confirm. I went on holiday to Ireland a couple of years ago and we stopped off in Cork for a couple of days, genuinely thought I had just gone mental because I couldn't understand anyone. It was as if I'd gone somewhere in the ass end of nowhere in Europe tbh.
Ya boisss lol those accents are so bad
please do more I'm at uni in London and i really miss Ireland and everything to do with this this genuinely made me so happy
Just "look at the graph" lol
oh my gosh please more videos like this! I love learning about Irish culture. I am 50% Irish/British according to 23 and Me and I know really nothing about my heritage from my family. Videos like these are just amazing and make me feel like I'm getting the inside knowledge about my heritage that I never got :)
I'm from Scotland and I can understand most of it. I'm half Irish btw 😂
I agree that the Irish accent is very sexy. I absolutely love it. I don't really care it it's Northern or Southern, I melt. I like the Dublin accent in general, both are gorgeous. The County Cork one is nice too when it's understandable. County Kerry and County Louth didn't sound that Irish.
Jeez I’m proud to be Irish
I'm from Ireland my dad seen u before.   Lol
Fun fact about Brad Pitt in snatch, the reason he was cast as mickey was because he loved lock stock and 2 smoking barrels and begged Guy Ritchie to be in the next film (snatch) But brad couldn’t pull off the cockney accent those films are both famous for, so the character of mickey was created to get him in the film, and the rest is cinema history.
This video killed me 🤣🤣🤣. RIP me 💀💀💀
U shud play Gta 55 campaign
Love Irish accents
JACK LISTEN TO A NEWFIES ACCENT
Love this video!
I love this so much we need more :D
Those Irish accents reminds me of my current situation. I moved to Bavaria/Bayern a few years ago, and there are sooooo freaking many accents xD I dont even understand them.
MY FATHER HAS POSTED
Idk if it’s an ADHD thing but if I turn off my brain and not try to understand every word specifically I can actually understand the farmer 😂
HUH? 😂😂
The same time when he said (go drink some milk child) at 0.43 I got a notification from a YouTube the had milk in the title
Jack: Mirror Also Jack: Mirrrrrrrrrrrrrrr Me: Whooot? Is he trying to trick me?? * *giggling noises* *
lmfao i loved this <3
Makes me wanna go to Ireland!
Ok
limrick rubber bandits baby
2:25  Jack sounds like grew
My father's father would talk like that. Always called me lad. Not sure he knew my real name until later in life.
Lovin it
sounds like he’s speaking norwegian
Dang it 5 hours late... whatever I'm still here🤣
If anything wild mountain thyme was like Scottish
My psychiatrist is Irish and he literally says "top o the mornin to ya" when we talk
Honestly, I was surprised I was able to understand the guy who lost his sheep
Who still watches jack
This is the same as the accents in Canada I have to put one on just to understand the newfies
When yur man was on about Limerick and the little fella in de corner showed up  I was wake laughing 🤣
Any Newfie’s?
Ireland sucks      This post was made my Scotland gang
Love Sean! But I do like Australian accents more
ive been summoned
I got a friend who's from Dublin and he has a Welsh roommate. They like to try and talk over each other for my attention and then I have no idea what either of them are saying.
I feel like no one without the real Irish accent can do a good Irish accent
As a dub all I can hear when yer man is scuttering on about his sheep is muck savage grunting
I'm currently re-reading the skulduggery pleasant books and at this point I have given up on imagining the irish accent almost everyone besides a few characters have. Somehow this accent is really hard to grasp - for me at least
I can proudly say that this is what I wake up too aswell.
Loved this video, it was such a hoot :D  My grandparents are from Newfoundland, so I do understand the dialect part. And the gibberish! Thanks for the video:P
Why do people dislike the videos just leave don’t try to bring someone down bc you don’t like it just leave
I couldn't understand sum of em but the ones with tho silver medals weren't bad at all ya should do a video of Scott's accent and see if you can understand em
You know what's worse than the "bad" Irish accents?  Your constant pausing. Hands off the keyboard and mouse!
The problem is what the accent is, and what people think the accent is. Like there was this time my choir was learning a Scottish song so we had to say somethings differently to sound right, well eventually we did a clinic with a Scottish composer who stopped in the middle of it to say "I don't know what you're trying to do or say, but it sure doesnt sound like my home". We all awkwardly laughed
So the words stay the same but how you say them changes. Well try the netherlands XD Words are made for the accent and then there Friesland. Fck i know how that happend.
As a spanish speaker, this video was a little bit easier to understand than to Jimmy Fallon.
i am born in dublin, And the farmers accent is just about understandable xD if i listen ill get it but sure look
Twas fun. I love a good Cork accent.
How here's irish
I live in Thurles in Tipperary and if I go 10k to Clonmel the accent is completely different
Some of those accent sound like swedish language
Took me a long time to realize the farmer speaking actual words and not Gibberish
I don't know about the sexiest, but listening to Irish people speak just gives me so much serotonin, you just want to smile hearing their accent. its not just the way it sounds, its the words and sentences they use, its so adorable.
That guy who lost his sheep also lost me in the process
if my video is on here i will cri :|
As a fan from the north of ireland i was a bit dissapointed we weren't mentioned at all, i suppose sean just wants to avoid any political issues to be fair but to have an entire video dedicatd to irish accents and then not talk about the thickest of them all  the belfast  accent seemingly because of fer of backlash got me down a bit
Holy shit the how to do an Irish accent video was made on my b-day
ire land
am i the only one who tried to like the sexiest irish accent video then paused the actual video and realized your a dumbass
I am so glad Jack knows about tHA FAWRTY FIVE SHEEP.
I'm from Ireland but I live in Australia so have a horrible mixture both accents and no ene can understand me except my Scottish friend... Make of that what you will.
Me and me mates would always say “oh ye wouldn’t be long getting frostbit 😂
Seán should react to Irish tik toks, I know Kevin did it but sure look
Jack smaller channels need your help with speaking out against this new policy youtube has put in place, the one where they put ads on smaller channels videos and dont pay them, youtube will make big money from this since there are so many smaller channels, SPEAK OUT AGAINST IT OUR IRISH YOUTUBER!!!
12:58
Ah there's a big difference between a travellers accent and an Irish accent even with Brad Pitt doing it
when  you see jack makes a reaction video and he didn't get demonetized
This video made me appreciate subtitles
I am a potato
I'm part Irish and Swedish and Scottish
i’m very much american and even I’M like “oh... oh no no no” 😂
before even watching the video im saying Unus’s  Irish accent
Imagine having an accent so strong you have to be translated from English to English.
omg thankyou, you just made my day this made me laugh
I feel like I have an Irish accent, I’m Dutch, is that weird?
Bruh just imagine the subtitles for the angry farmer
Man they did limerick so wrong swear down they just took the fkn rubberbandits pretty much haha
I think the "your wan" thing comes from the Irish for you woman which would translate to "do bhean" (pronounced duh van) which overtime softened and turned in wan... at least it's my theory.  P.s. As an Irish person you are forgiven for the "top of the morning" thing as long as we don't have to feckin' say it.  Go raibh mile sile!
I’m Irish and go m cringing at them trying to do Irish accents🇮🇪
though she got her cake vibe checked 1:55
To be perfectly honest Jack, whenever I am trying to do an Irish accent, I try my best to replicate your voice
I could watch this all day. My thick Texan accent sounds awful, the Irish accent sounds positively gorgeous compared to what i hear all day.
I understand 95% of what was said in all the videos without seàn saying anything does that mean I'm irish??? (Well yes partially (like 1/32 irish) but that means nothing i never been to Ireland so how could I understand it simple it was mostly in english)
Every time you do one of these videos, I wish you would collab with Hazel Hayed 🙈
I went to Cork for a choir trip and i think even I, a canadian, had an irish accent after bring there for just 2 weeks
Try do Sean from red dead redemption 2
Australian is nice too
Just turn on the captions...DUH
Nogla's accent by far.
For the sheep guy I could only understand like...half of what he said. I so.
Brad Pitt gets a pass because of the Italian accent scene from Inglourious Basterds
I'm sorry Sean, I had to unsubscribe in order to subscribe again. I'm so sorry....
oh i am Au and  thought that we where hard to understand
Australian got 5th? Wtf?! Australian accents are awful, I would know, I live in Australia surrounded by people with strong accents. Edit: I take back this comment, the fuck was wrong with me, Aussie accents are fantastic.
Sean you had me laughing my ass off at work. Thank you for lifting my mood!
TBH when I was maybe 16yo and just started watching english speaking youtubers I would use subtitles because very often I could not understand what Sean was taking about xd Now I have no problems with that ^ ^
16:59 OMG YOU SAID MY NAME I’M FREAKING OUT (It’s Fleur)
Hot fuzz is the BEST film 🧡🧡🧡🧡
Learning any accent requires months of prep, and most actors can't or won't put in that much time. The Irish accent probably needs tree times as much time.
I love P.S. I Love You 😭
Irish farmer: *starts speaking My Asian ears: Is he trying to summon the final boss?
Irish farmer: *starts speaking My Asian ears: Is he trying to summon the final boss?
brat pitts acent is actully good its kinda dublin
6:45 am I the only person who hears "fortnite"?
How is Scots came third is beyond me, we are harsh as fuck 😂
There’s always that one girl who talked in an accent in middle school
OMG REACT TO SMINKY SHORTS THEYRE THE BEST THING EVER
poor Robin having to edit these unintelligible Irish noises.
Is it just me or do some of those accents almost sound... Jamaican? Like the rowers did for a second I swear.
13:28 "general kenobi"
*Get To The Chopper*
Wondering if sean ever watch Derry Girls 👀
Sean should have joined that Among Us game by OTV & friends where they made impressions.  Would have been hilarious 😂
My German teacher tries to put on an Irish accent
That Christopher Walken impression was gold... I died.
Now accents are cool and all, but I feel like you're forgetting the MVP. Gaeilge.
The videos: Sidndbsimanalsidbdbsmskjs Seán: HAHA Me: 👁👄👁
But like Jamie Dornan is Irish soooooo...
The thick irish accent's are like people who mastered not moving their lips or have their lips paralyzed.
You should make a teams or a google classroom.
Sometimes when the Irish farmer was speaking it sounded like he was speaking Japanese lol
I'm from kerry so I could detect the accent immediately
I THOUGHT GAA WAS RTGAME
I wish he put on English auto translation/subtitles just to see what madness YouTube came up with
I am doing Irish it's hard
19:07 Literally JUH SEAN in a nutshell.
this video was great
I've been working on some construction site (not really technically, but sort of), and there were multiple contractors and other company chain guys from different countries.  I was on site for three days, and asked: Are these guys Swedish? they were Irish.. you should have seen a look on my face.
I kinda want you to do this video again, but with dutch accents.
Ireland is cool but Gaelic is a dead language should never be uttered again, don’t believe me well “an féidir liom dul go dtí an seomra folctha” is “can I go to the bathroom” THATS WAY TO LONG IRELAND, WAY TO LONG!!,
Bhí an ceann ó chiarraí bréagach
At 3:45 is that Jason Statham?
This was very cool to watch I really liked this. I wish to go to Ireland one day so I can cross it off my bucket list.
18:27 here is were i died(lol)
I'm from Ireland, but I live in Australia   so I have a horrible mixture of both and no one can ever understand me except my Scottish friend and no one else can understand him either...
So interesting. I love language and accents. That we use these sounds to communicate, and that it's just so incredibly diverse and beautiful. It fascinates me. Being swedish myself all the accents from north to south has such a diversity. And I hope it isn't going to die out any time soon. It has sort of started to sadly.
Norwegian is easier to understand to an English speaker than the farmer’s Irish accent
Wanted to let you know that I’m from Texas and somehow we say mirror the same way, like “mirrr”
Said he said i
eh skhsgykfjfjsifui fiji sheep in like the yamth of the sheeep shookutin mountain
It’s sad when you hear stuff like this and you go “ oh yeah that’s easy, try talking to a man from the south with no teeth”
you should watch 'belfast film' by shane todd, honestly one of my favourite videos  11:52 also that was the most ballymena accent i've ever heard
Cuppa' Tea f'teh Big Falla
Irish people, your accents are beautiful. I may not be able to understand some of you, but I think they’re lovely nonetheless.
That old man sounds like he’s speaking some sorta Nordic language
Do southern people in every country just have stronger accents. Like the more southern you get wherever in the world the stronger the accent
there’s no designated accent for a country because there’s so many different accents depending on the part of the country lol “i can do a british accent!” lmao okay? which one?
The explanation of how you pronounce "mirror". Literally same lmfaooo except I'd say it's more two e's instead of an i aka meer + 14 more r's, in my case at least. I don't think anyone actually pronounces it the way it's spelled. (Please, let me know if I'm wrong reply section) Because even brits pronounce it like mirrah lmfao
Why can Jack do a better british accent than me... I'm from London too
Irish person  learning Irish hmmmm
Got love me the American white cishet neurotypical actor The character is from a place with a strong accent? We can do it The character is a poc? We can do it The character is trans? We can do it  The character is autistic? We can do it No hate but Hollywood thinks they can put these same american actor to do anything instead of shining a light on talented actors who actually fit this categories
FrostBUTT
I'm with jack on going to Ireland! My great grandfather came over from Ireland when his church burned down an married my great grandmother who was born in the USA but was also full Irish. Also I'd like to know what my name (Shawn Delaney) means like Jack knows what his name means in Ireland lol.
That moment when Irish, Scottish and British English, and Australian English sound all the same, that you don't really care anymore, all you can say is "welp, It's British English " :D even if it is not. Scottish I think is the most distinguishable, the rest just sounds the same with slight changes.  P.S. You should've done a review of the Peaky Blinders episodes where they meet an Irish mob boss or something and he speaks in Irish (Thomas meets Jimmy McCavern), I actually liked his way of accent, but would like to have had your opinion on it.
Jack sean whats your name I will buy you a happy meal
I've listened to that farmer so much that I can understand him now
Try looking up Newfoundlander accents basically the Canadian version of a Irish accent.
You should have reacted to some accents from the north.
I'm from london and I could definitely tell that lady isn't Irish 😭
Why you didn't see the video with the old man ?
I'd love to say "you are FEKKIN EJIT" to someone straight in their face, it sounds what it means, but may leave the opposite party unsure what you meant
I can understand it but just barely,
Omg I’m Irish and I had no clue what that farmer was saying about his sheep well I actually cinde new what he was saying but not really hahahhahaa
This must be how most people hear us talk on stuff like Swamp people
Some our thick Quebecker accents are almost as bad. But a lot less famous than Irish.
With the Farmer one it kinda sounded like thai to me if I didn't pay really close attention to it (as in how the flow of the words, break up of syllables, & highs and lows per word) Since Thai has a usually smooth, soft yet sharp tone to it, so it racked my brain a bit lol (Also, unfortunately I can't read/write in Thai just understand it :,D)
Jack summoning that nature chakra for this one.
Most of the time we understand you just fine Jack but, sometimes when you play with the lads your accent gets all thick and such and its a bit more difficult to understand.
Hey Seán! If you haven't seen it before...Irish People Try America's Strongest Alcohol is one of my favorite Irish lyrical journeys on the internet.
I was drinking milk as he said it go to bed birch LOL :(
its like in umbrealla acadamy (good spellingbtw) the swedish guys arent even swedish like what??
I love this Seán!!  Thank you for making me laugh yet again. Its been a rough day and you just made it a ton better🙂 Love you  and I hope everyone has a great day!
L O L
Jack introduces his most Irish video ever, But Seán where's the beer?
Hey Sean! In my school I’m actually learning how to speak in an Irish Dialect, so I got excited when I saw this video!
Sean you look tired
6:37 I'm trying to figure out what he is saying while thinking about three other languages and trying to talk danish
All these just reminded me of angry Nogla😅💚
It's minion speak, a mix of a bunch of different languages
Think every country is like this lol. Even in America it’s like this. Though more of every city and town will have a slightly different accent. Every state has a designated accent but every city and town for some reason changes it slightly.
I am awful with accents and dialects! My brother is so good at them,  why can't I have that skill😂
fun fact the ‘FROSTBIT’ vid is actually shown in my uni during the introduction week of english linguistics because its a great example of the difference in regional dialect also my uni is in belfast, northern ireland so its hilarious since we have a high number of international students who hadnt a fecking clue what was being said in it
And if you hate it you're wrong
Meme time
Jack is milkgang
Are leprechauns real? ☘️
Arhg
Drinking milk? Ha jokes on you am drinking chocolate milk
You should do more videos like this but with other accents
The irish love the accent
Did you stop turbo dismount you haven’t done that in a long time
Think being Scottish helps with the understanding? I heard all of that.   🤣🤣🤣
... is this farmer even speaking english. what.
There are so many dialects and I think a lot of people forget about that when they think of accents🙂
I love that europeans can do american accents brilliant but american cant do a irish accent at ALL
JESUS, 1/5 of your viewers liked your video xD
The joke in Snatch is that he's a Traveller and no one can really understand him.
Jack can you look at your early videos so you can compare your accent to then and now lmfao
My anatomy professor this past semester was Irish. I’ll never forget my amazement when I heard him pronounce the word “three” on the first day of class.
Finally its not among us Miss u so bad🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤
at 5:38 i remember thinking wait... that's fucking ENGLISH
Me reading the comments after watching the video everything sounds irish
The two people listening to the accents are wearing their masks wrong 🙄
4:57 Yes, there it is! Kevin watched this before and I just knew you would too <3 8:18 Sus indeed!
Please bring back Dead by Daylight
Hey France ain’t the only one eating shit think about Quebec !
Is jack gonna play cyberpunk when it comes out
"Flower" killed me😂😂😂
19:10 i swear to god, i legitly thought it's Terroriser making an appearance lol
Jack being irish Jack watching a video on how to speak irish Jack: saying all of the irish words correctly  Jack: omg I'm so good at this
Honestly, Ive watched jacksepticeye for a long time, I sometimes forget he has an accent.
19:51 Im suprised sean doesnt know who the lad with the bag over his head is   Im pretty sure its meant to be Lost Boy from the Rubberbandits  Great podcasts and very smart/funny lads.Sean if you see this i recommend checkin them out there great craic on there podcasts Now i dont know if your into podcasts but sure look it.Give them a chance and see how ye like them
rumor says that 99% of jacks dislikes are mothers getting mad at there kids for watching someone who swears
Stab city??????
I had an Irish teacher once her name was miss Meagher
i find it so strange that people always do an Irish accent like a leprechaun, but if you hear traditional dublish its the complete opposite and Dublin has the vast majority of our population
"Why don't they just cast Irish actors"  HEY SIA IF YOU MAKE A MOVIE ABOUT AUTISM, WHY NOT CAST AUTISTIC INDIVIDUALS HEY STRAIGHTS, IF YOU MAKE A MOVIE ABOUT LGBTQIA+ CAST LGBTQIA+ PEOPLE sorry about that, but its like if you're not American and straight you don't get accurate rep, not even if you're Caucasian yourself
Its like doing an English accent too. There's so many :'D
Jack play Valhalla
The number of people from America that try British accents is so bad and I’m Bristolian and they use the queens English and I hate it
I was hoping to see some of the Young Offenders stuff on this but the last one had me in stitches 😂😂
We need more of this. Please do more video's of this.
Before you even said the Christopher Watkins line. I literally said to myself, “sounds like Christopher Watkins and that’s it”
I’m Irish what part of Ireland are you frim
Sean, I would LOVE it if you did a reaction video to Gangs of New York. It's a great movie (Daniel Day Lewis is arguably the best actor in the movie, one of his best roles imo) but OMG Cameron Diez(?) does an AWFUL "Irish" accent throughout the entire movie. Some of the other accents are a bit iffy but hers is genuinely horrid.  Edit for clarification: Some of the other actor's accents could be explained by their characters coming from different parts of Ireland, Cameron's accent is just wrong all around, I cringe every time I hear it.
I would LOVE if Jacksepticeye talked Irish slangs for an entire video, but I would LOVE LOVE if Jacksepticeye talked Irish slangs in a multiplayer video.
Watch sgt ducky he has the best guides to ireland and they are soo funny
I'm from the deep south of the US, and had zero problem understanding the "mad" accent. Definitely couldn't replicate it though! After hundreds of years at this point living in the backwoods and introducing accents from all over, we've developed some crazy accents of our own. I know several people who sound legitimately like Boomhauer from King of the Hill.
yes this is what anyone who isnt in hollywood does in life lol
JACK WATCH THE NEW TOM AND JERRY MOVIE
I've watched young offenders too many times that Cork is the default Irish I go to.
I have never laughed so hard in my life! 🤣
I can’t believe I’m hearing actual English....
ME: OH wow thats a good Irish accent.... Jack: THAT DOESNT SOUND IRISH Me: 😳❓⁉️
His Christopher Walken impression sounds like Arnold sqwartsinager
7:43 There is some slang that comes out that I don't know sometimes, but I think Seán is completely understandable. One thing I have noticed over quarantine is Seán's grammar changing. Frequently dropping the word 'to' from a sentence-- I don't know if he's aware of it.   In my personal life I am FREQUENTLY asked where I'm from.  My accent slips a lot because of the kind of TV shows I binge. So one inflection on a certain vowel, and people assume I'm from the midwest USA, or the UK. Someone asked me what part of Greece I'm from? No, I'm a southern belle from Tennessee, y'all.
irish is just mumble rap wym
now whos generalising by saying she sounds british. some of ireland is british
"Aaahhhh Brad Pitt you're lucky you're GORGEOUS "
This is before I finished the video and if he doesn’t show the scene where Unus and Annus tried speaking accents I’ll be very disappointed
I can't tell the difference between irish and scottish accents.
5:25 i dont know if theyre saying 35 or 45.
ya like jazz
Ya, I am a sucker for an Irish accent. Though this was quite entertaining
I was watching this right before a class and when I joined the class my teachers was trying to do a Irish accent. It was terrible.
As someone who's from Yorkshire and has family in Cork, can you imagine how our conversations sound? Lmao.
Being able to understand that farmer is a whole another level Seán , damn brilliant
If you slow the playback down a bit during the farmer bit, makes his accent so much funnier.
To me he is talcing jiberish
The Irish accent is like the mumble rap accent of English.
I like that Irish accent best You know, the one with the man
The subtitles for the Snatch clip just make it even more confusing. My brain hurts
That was fun to watch Jack...
Sure jasus boi that's gas craic now.    That was a great video 🤣
ya jack 2012 hey hey! how's its going
I can not understand a single fuckin word
we too have alote of accente like 30 km by accente in the biggest country in africa more then that we have alote of language too so diffrente that we dont understande but the native language is arabic and we use somekind of arabic mix with france that no one speak arabic can understande and its very faster too then the iresh and its sound better too .
“Go back to bed, child. Start drinking more milk B***.”  I literally took a sip of coffee right as he said that. It stopped me in my tracks and I stared at him for 10 seconds contemplating what just happened. I have concluded that I am not a child. I drink coffee. Scared me there.
Aye, those are some grand accents right there.
I feel like this was a target at the 2 Men 200 Accents Unus Annus video
Dia dhuit an bhfuil sibh go maith
Duely noted. Before I audition for a revival of "Finian's Rainbow" I'll devote myself to listening to Sean for a week.
The Olympics 2016 video I could totally understand. But the man with the sheep really didnt sound like he was talking English.
You should look up Newfoundland Canada accents a lot of it comes from Ireland/Scotland some people just here in town have crazy thick accents
There's a channel that does Irish people try different things. You should watch those videos
At first I couldn't understand the farmer, but the more I heard him speak the more of it I understood.
Jack sounds more of a mix between Irish, English and American accents. Like his accent has become a lot softer over the years and I think it’s safe to say it’s very easy to comprehend for most English-speaking people
This is really fun! Wish this video was twice as long
Some Irish accents are so hard to understand, that some almost sound Russian
This is how i hear it..  Su oi caim back frum school the other da' and de fukin ice cream man staded' de regula' rout ye?' so wen oi welk bock om' and pet mei' dowg oi se'...
Irish people are just European Australians
U should make a video speaking as gailge
My dad is Irish but I sound like ass trying to do the accent
Has anyone heard of the drunken sailor song?
teacher : the listening test is going to be easy the listening test :
I have a British or Australian accent but no Irish accent. None at all!
Why do i feel like ive seen this video before?
I absolutely loved this video 😂
The fact that I literally was thinking "so you're gonna just watch your own videos then?" as a joke right after drinking some milk anD HE FUCKING SAYS THAT  Sean. Please stop being on the same wavelength as me. It's weird
Your stealing CallMeKevin
Why the f is Swedish nr.7? It's awful XD // a swede
"Why didnt you just cast Irish people?" Says the Irish youtuber. Me and autistic to Sia "why didnt you just cast autistic people?" Bish.
This is the third time he's berated me for watching while unsubscribed... He finally broke me
Ya like dags?
some people from the more rural parts of quebec speak in a similar way but in french
and this is why people thought all Irishmen where drunk
no New Zealand was accent was voted the sexiest accent in the world or something like that
Those rowing dudes weren't that hard to understand to be honest. I caught about 85% of their words
Lady: They pronounce it as Oiland Jack, immediately afterwards: Ireland
As an American, I find it really hard to imitate an Irish accent.
Hi Sean I know you might not see this but I wanna thank you for giving me the confidences to speak out to someone get get the help I need. It my not seem like much to others and you may not know it  but you really made a big impact on my life.without your videos I probably wouldn’t be here right now. Thanks for everything. 😊   Plz help me get this message to Sean so he can see what he does to help ❤️ thanks
This video has helped me fake an irish accent better than any how-to video on yt I've seen so far and I've watched several
I swear very few Irish people me being one of them actually watches Sean it's nice to know that people actually realize Ireland a thing
react to the rubberbandits lad
Learn english back in china in a international school with 47 different nationality in a span of 3 year, I came through the wildest accent that be Scottish, australian, asian never add a hard time understanding any of them, but god protect me this irish farmer is impossible to understand
Are we sure he's speaking english at 5:06
Irish accents are my favorite. It's just so fun sounding
I'm Irish and even could barely understand the farmer at first
They probably could’ve cast Soarise Ronan and it would’ve been better
Congrats to jack for translating that verbal diarrhoea
I'm Irish and can't do the accent to save my life
You should have worn your hat for this
i'm quite proud that i was able to understand the farmer but aye it was a struggle
2:21 HEAHAEHA sean sounds like gru when he says it like that
You know what I want to see? Jack playing legend of Zelda breath of the wild.
Yer kerry one sounded like she is from listoal or whatever way you spell it
This is from another race, an ethereal one, like, they speak the language of the gods.
I can understand everything because I live in Ireland   R.I.P to all Americans
"Get focked italy" . As an italian, i'd be willing to be getting focked, as long as it's an irish cute woman (?)
I'm from Cork and yes we do talk a lot like that. 😂😂😂👍
aww.. no Norman Reedus' irish.. XD
BRO it sounds like the irish old man was speaking Spanish and I cant believe Australian is in 5th place with the most sexiest accent in the world. IM PART IRISH AND I CAN DO A AUSTRALIAN ACCENT BETTER THAN AN IRISH ONE WHAT THE BLOODY FUCK
Seán: we don’t say top of the mornin to ya Also Seán: has a top of the mornin coffee brand and has said it in videos for years
I am still fully convinced that old irish farmer is speaking some ancient and unknowable language
I'm half irish and even i couldn't understand half the things that farmer was saying haha
this just makes me think of sean from red dead redemption 2 lmao
seán: I don't know what this videos is my unwanted opinion: the actual best video on this channel
19:50 is it not a 'the rubber bandits' reference??
On a similar note: Cajun food not made in south Louisiana by a Creole or Cajun cook, IS NOT CAJUN FOOD.  (this means your popeyes)
I watched the farmer video like a week before and was like “I wander what Jack would think”
This was hilarious It wouldn bodder me a bit ta see mar oirish accent vidyas
Whats wrong with milk?
10:16 *Dueling Banjos intensifies*
I'm lactose intolerant Jack.... No milk pls.....
Dude I'm not English but still understood most of the hard to understand Irish people
Me a real Irish person
Call me Kevin did this first
When is your next laugh it’s been months
I just do the fake Irish accent for fun
Woah woah woah woah woah woah woah woah. HOLD THE FUCK UP.  French accents are rated fucking FOURTH? Who the fuck took this survey? French is the universal "sexy" accent, it's called the language of love for a reason? o_O
Who else misses the outro
I really enjoyed this video,  as a foreigner, I do love Irish accent but I get anxiety if I need to talk to Irish people here xD Greetings from Cork.
We will never know whether jacks translation was correct or not
"Keep it in the blindfold jeff" 😂
I love that you did this kind of video. Your reactions were great lol
Ex-bloody-cues me i can sound sexy if i wanna.......but first i would need to not panic about anything and everything that can go wrong.       XD
Are ye trying to ignore the north of ireland
idk whether it's because I'm fully desensitized to accents or I've just been hearing jack speak the whole video but the accents were a lot softer then I expected
I actually understood bits and pieces of it
HOW IN HELL CAN JACK TRANSLATE
It's like I can _kind of_ get the gist of what they're saying and then Jack translates and I realize I missed an entire phrase or term. Well on ya, lads. That's a hell of an accent you got.
You say oil dat sh** mine
10:40 - ''Now in ENGLISH we say I'', as if we didn't know already that Irish is not english at all.
7:44 no.. actually I can understand you but I think people like to exaggerate the accent just a little bit.. some people aren’t that nice.. oh and I could understand that guy.. but some words my brain refused to translate coz my brain doesn’t know what it’s hearing.. it’s so weird.. sorry for laughing though..
i can translate it cause im from a ireland and i have a strong irish accent
Jack! You should play dying light again and do the story this time, trust me it's a good story I did it multiple times. Also, dying light 2 is coming out near 2021. Hope you see this! @jacksepticeye
I could understand rage school kid
I thought he was speaking Chinese
Wtf i didn't understand shit
In Irish and this hurts my soul😐😐😐👉
the farmers accent is so strong he sounds scouse
I've read somewhere that the Gaelic language is dying but it's a good thing that the accent is here to stay with these thick Irish accents haha
Which ones were y’all able to understand? The only one I couldn’t get was the sheep farmer 🥺😂
this video was the most confused video I’ve ever watched being in this channel for idk 4/5 years? english isn’t my native language and it’s hard for itself, i literally sit for 21 min asking wth were they saying and it was amazing
i'm questioning my fluency in english
The old man said: “Possibly at night, that’d be a full moon that I was likin, and should’ve been bright out and then anyone can go up in the mountains if they like to” that was the hardest sentence to figure out lads, but I did it, I think I messed up a bit but I did my best.
Makes me miss my grandfather. He was born in Limerick, but I'm not sure if it was always stabby or got that way after he left.
I DON'T CAR (1:57)
i literally couldn't understand what the angry farmer was saying to save my life.
watching such videos makes me want to be irish
Ja loking litte wierd after i saw 10+hours of you playing gow4 so you looking litte wierd and sound litte difrentte
I know Sean isn’t Australian but he should react to some Australian accents
HAHAHAHAHAH I GOT THE TOP 3 SEXIEST ACCENTS My bad, top 4 sexiest accents
I do like the "polite" lilt. But that's mainly because I didn't know there's so much more to the language.
Is Éireannach mé so I mean
Next up, Peaky Blinders! I know it's English, but I still need subtitles.
Only time I found Brad Pitt attractive was in Snatch. Hmmm
10:15 the only thing musical about it is, it sounds like a grand piano being shoved down a flight of stairs.
noooooooooo jack stopped before northern Irish accents at the end
The only one I couldn't understand was the farmer, thought I could but Jack's translation proved I didn't lol
How to say flour in an irish accent    Flare
Here in Australia I see a underwear ad and this guy on the ad was trying to be Irish
Who else loves jack 💯
at 10:40 his face went from okay to hold on wait a gosh damn second really fast 😂
I dated a guy from cork for a good while and the cork accent is the only one I can understand lol
brad pitts accent is deemed flawless by most accent coaches
If bad handwriting was an accent it would be Irish
my teachers Irish and i do not learn from her  history btw which i have just found out that a-lot of history teachers are Irish
When you're with your lads you absolutely sound like that.  When you're just recording it's much more clear.
WHAt tHE fACk jEFF
Irish people basically speaks both German and French at the same time. That's my conclusion.
I feel like there are different accents wherever you go. When I moved from Michigan to Ohio, only about 150 miles, I noticed differences in accents and pronunciation.
I figured it out, the accent from the frostbit guy, he sounds like hes from wisconsin or alberta canada, its the same sing songy way of speaking holy moly, how delightful xD
The best one was from a US show Castle doing Geordie! I fucking wet myself. I'm from Gateshead (or Gatesheed) no one can do it 😂😂😂
Ireland’s most famous gamer makes fun of his own culture
i love brad pitt’s fake accent lmaooo
If you’re able to watch that Thyme movie in the cinemas you should occasionally speak in an Irish accent while making fun of their bad impersonations of it. That would be hilarious if someone just heard that while watching that movie.
this vid just made me realize im racist
We say are land that's how we pronounce
I want JSE to make a video of him cooking traditional Irish dishes and tasting them
The funny thing is right now to me that I was watching u with undertale and didn’t focus on all your new videos at all I want you to do undertale again
There's a severe lack of "hoity toity" going on and I'm convinced these aren't REAL accents
All irish people watching this being like "Sure no bother Sean, no need to translate I've got every word"  Everyone else : "👁👄👁"
I don’t know who it was but their “Irish accident” just sounded like one of the terminators
Watch sgt ducky
“It may be English...” What an abrupt end to a delightful video!
That was posh Louth hey
The sheep part just reminded me so much of Hot Fuzz.
id love to hear the dude with the 45 sheep missing speak while high, not a single soul on earth would be able to understand him
I like how the boy sounded like he said frostbutt
I had a physics teacher two years ago who had a thick North Dublin accent. He was an incredibly nice but slightly intimidating man.  And as a Scotsman born without, I would absolutely LOVE to have a Scottish accent. My dad, grandpa and all of my sisters have thick accents, but neither myself nor my brothers have accents. My older brother can well mimic a Glaswegian accent like Kevin Bridges' one, but he doesn't have an accent himself. If he does it's almost undetectable. We were born half English, so our accents got put right in the middle between northern Scots and southern English. Quite a bit disappointed that I don't have an accent, if I'm honest.
We really are a different breed! Teacht ar Éirinn
BRUH THE IRISH ACCENT IS ITS OWN LANGUAGE
You should play assassin's creed Valhalla it's a viking game
Sean, we ALL had fun
I'm from Northern Ireland translate:Am fum Nor Irn lid meet at bss depo meate
Being in different counties in Ireland  is like being in different countries and I live there 🤣🤣
Never say that to a Scottish man i would know i am one.
The greatest one was the sligo accent, da wan u didn't show in the video but shure yell find out anawy
all hail pickens
People done realize that there are tons of different accents in every country 😳
You played Teardown yet?
💚💚💚💚💚
I Hate when people say Scottish and irish accents sound the same im Scottish and they sound completely different lol
it's the same where I live, some people have a thick quebecois accent and nobody can understand them
All I remember from Snatch is Brad Pitts accent
Jack better be on this list
Aaaaa this was so fun to watch!
"go back to bed child" me who just woke up: (._.  )
0:26 Germany during both world wars
Jacksepticeye's funniest home videos?
Me, not even being from any english-speaking country, makes this a hard one to follow at times. But I love Irish accent, it's so wild.
All right. I need to visit Ireland now.
Sean, you gots ta do more of these improvised videos. Absolutely grand.
This was so funny
I’m Irish and my god the accent of the sheep guy is very heavy lol
I love how many countries have their Kerrys. For example here in Austria, we speak German, but don't try to understand somebody from Vorarlberg. Even most of us can't understand a word they're saying...
It's fun because some words sound like a drunk swedish person trying to speak english. 😂
LIMERICK REPRESENT. YA GOWLS
Now I want to watch Circle of Friends lol
How the heck can you translate that jack that impressive
There is no way that man is speaking English 😂
I'm Irish (mind you Dublin irish is very different to other counties irish) but even I dont have a clue what mikey o'shea was saying 5:15
MAYO FORR SAMM!!!!!!!!
video:*talks about how  some    people don’t all sound like leprechauns* me at 3AM with a fear of leprechauns looking at the screen confused:  wait a minute your telling me SOME can sound like leprechauns 👁👄👁
The irish farmer sounds like a North Wales accent at times
Scottish top of morning:Tae o' tha murnin' to ya laddies!  Just saying Scottish top of morning sounds like a fit top of morning. But I'd say urs is better no offense!!!
That was amazing.
As a Spaniard who almost don't speak english this was a confusing video
Honestly I understood like one word
Over farty five!
Jack just kept on laughhing of his own accent. Brad Pitt (i need to take a shite) Jack Nice One.
IS THIS A REACTION VIDEO?!?
Am I the only one he said Irish actor’s Thoughts of Liam Neeson
Watching people butcher a generic version of the Irish brogue makes me realize why Seán muted his own accent in 2012. He must have thought the rest of the World assumed that’s what all Irish people sound like! 💚🤣🤣💚
Why so segsy 😲
We need a part 2 and 3 and then ask other youtubers and ppl
The thing is though, I am not even a native English speaker but I do actually understand plenty of what they are saying
Irish accents just call out Tree Potatoes
That accent was so heavy it sounded like a weird imbred child between German and one of the norther European countries
Seing Sean like others comments Me getting excited and thinking of something cool to say so he will like my comment. Also me: haha Irish go brrr
I might be child but i drink my coffee like i drink my milk ( if i drinked milk)
me, a swede who questions why sweden was even considered let alone PUT on the list of sexy accents
6:46 its sounds like a cross between a different language and just being played backwards.
Ahhhh so this is the video you were talking about in your stream
The title is clickbait  Sean would’ve been able to understand the accents
Favorite accent? All of them.
I can't choose a specific Irish accent I could just listen to them all for hours tbh I love it.
Im 50% Irish
Hold on wait a second, I agree that Irish should be number 1, but why is Australian at least number 2 sexiest accent.
This is the second time today I heard someone talking about the movie “Snatch”.  That’s weird.  Both mentions were from men who think Brad Pitt is “gorgeous”.  Incredible.
Jack your accent is number one ALWAYS
I’d love to see Sean try redo one of the Irish listening exams that they do for the leaving cert 😂😂 it’s all good until the Ulster dialect
Jack's not even Irish anyway
How did you not talk about the Donegal accent, sure tis the best one lad!
Jack, you'er like an irish coffee, hot, sweet, and full alcohol
7:23 it just looks like some slammed thare head against a keyboard.
Go raibh maith agat. Great content!
Same in wales. People don’t realise that there’s more then one welsh accent
Amzing funny video and i loveeee accents tooo
so I live in the Scottish borders where are accents are generally lighter than up in the highlands and I thought it would be pretty easy for Americans to understand me but when my granda went on holiday to America he told me just trying to order a meal was almost impossible because they couldn't understand him which makes me think my accents gotta be thicker than I realise
Do lots of different accents from different English speaking countries
English is not my main language, but i must say i never had any trouble understanding what you say jack.
Farthy five
This was fun
Honestly, it sounds like the sim language
My favorite accent is Irish and my second is Scottish. Scottish is so brutal
5:07 sounds like hes a scouser
Being Irish and watching yer man in that video gon about dem er sheep was so cringy liek
“music of the irish accent.” it’s music alright. it’s mumble rap.
My favorite accent was Jack's
I want to hear Jack do a full video with him talking as if he was back in Ireland, using all the sayings he grew up with.
I'm American, but I've had similar situations because part of my family is from a small town in Mississippi, where the southern accent is deep and they talk fast, and I'll understand them, but anyone else will be clueless 😂
According to his accent coach, Brendan Gunn, Pitt’s accent is a generalised travelling community accent and tbh, as someone from Belfast, it’s fairly spot on
Seán you should do an entire video speaking the Irish accent with english subtitles
The actual best accent in Ireland is Fermanagh (no biased here)
-Google translate has left the Chat
Where are you from jack I must know now
you do, but you don't sound the same - we just generalize like mad because we human aren't we
this was great! love the Irish shtuff
7:51 this was you years ago
jokes on you, i AM IN BED
You should get a few Irish people to get together in an Among Us lobby. And post it on YT. And since I'm your "cousin" Vote Me! :P
I’m part Irish, I do have a little Irish accent, jack you are amazing 😉 you made me be myself when my accent came out, thank you 🙏
There's a scene in The Godfather where Michael asks one of his buddies to translate his English into Italian despite having spoken Italian in an earlier scene.  When I was younger, I never understood why, until my dad explained to me that the difference between dialects in the Italian Michael had spoken and the Italian his friend was speaking and even the (very small amount of) Italian that we speak in the US are so different they might as well be another language.
"Say top of the morning." Jack: "Nobody says that." Jack's fans: "bruh"
As an Italian, the Irish definitely deserve the #1 sexiest accent spot
That lady was legit just doing a Cavan accent
You do  sound a little bit  like that lol 😆 😂🙃
why i had so much fun
What? This is like watching sims trying to talk to one another and I'm trying to understand.  Trust me, I love every bit of it.
Mirrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
Am I the only one who thinks the Irish Student looks like G-Man?
we got 3rd leave us alone
i fucking understood the frostbit school boy holy shit, i mean i am from scotland so listening to fast talking people isn't too hard for me but it all depends on where that person comes from
Also shaun should listen to rally English 😂 thats whats worth laughing at.
Noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo right at the end there he was about to do donegal
Its sounds like a different language
Yes Scottish came 3rd
Irish is basically trying to say as much as possible in the shortest amount of time while simultaneously trying to not open your mouth much. Gods be damned, I'm proud to be part Irish.
My American accent is boring
the things you learn on youtube
Out of all the accents that I herd yours was the greatest
was i the only one that got unus annus flashbacks when he was talking about non-irish people in the beginning having terrible accents?   yeah... okay
i found your videos a few years ago during my drama class! we all had to pick a accent and give a monologe! and you were the first video that popped up!
Congrats Jack you can roast yourself now!
10:19 in and Im thinking of a song that I was taught when I was younger. You canne shove yer granny af a bus
honestly jack has a very clear hearing irish accent  plus i love all accents but irish is a very unique accent and sometimes very funny
You should do a video reacting to Scottish, Welsh and English accents! Think that would be a funny video to watch 😂
Do more subnautica  below zero
😈what about the American accent😈 it’s the most underrated accent in the world
Me a Newfoundlander be like: hey that what we sound like
The two types of people with the name Sean  The one who screams like a rooster, addicted to bells, and calls everyone on the internet children  Then the one who sounds like someone smashed a keyboard
Niall from 1d has an accent like séan
Do a vid about the netherlands!!!
This would be great watching people try to do scouse accents
the sad part is i understood all of these while being American but i grew up around my Irish family
We have sexy accident .... FUCKIN HELL YESSS
Subscribe to oompaville
Me: Bends over to pick up a pencil Literally every friend in the room: 1:52
"Haha eat shit France" made me lose it
We need scp cb.
I can't believe Sean was able to understand that guy 😂
It's so hard watching people mess up your accents, you feel a sense of second hand embarrassment
Try the Newfoundlander’s accents 😳🤚
I dare Jack to do an American accent.
5:32 Fred Rickwood from father ted 🤣🤣🤣
Jack: get f*cked Italy, bad luck for you Scotland. Me: *looks further down the list sees Australia* Well it good to see 3 of my background where close.
Scotland has entered the chat
Jack please play destiny 2 it is soooooooooooooooooo good
Can you do a skate 4 let's play pls.
I love seeing Jack gush about the Irish culture and such. So interesting to see how different every area sounds
Did he just say hhhhhheeeerrrrrb 🤢
Irish accent of billy boys in peaky blinder is also pretty good lad.....
It was the same in New Zealand when we one the worlds sexiest voice. There's like three different accents down here just based on your job
Lovethis 🤣🤣made me smile today! Thanks Sean
I am sad becuase I am scottish
YUO BAD\
These are seans funniest type of videos 😂😂😂
Jack should watch peaky blinders
I have learned all I know about Irish accents from Foil Arms and Hog
I’m so happy you did this video! Thank you for translating for the sheep farmer 😆 been wondering for years what he was on about
Omg I literally laughed the whole time watching this Sean ur actually amazing best YouTuber ever💞
The fuck is that dude saying? Btw: it’s the bit we’re the dude loses the sheep  Wait imagine if your freinds with this dude and he starts speaking jîbërįšh you would be like 🤔 Wut? Sorry didn’t get that  Edit: 8:17 Did he say frostbutt?
When he mentioned Hot Fuzz all I can think is that's my county accent... I understand it 😂😂😂
as someone who grew up with a grandpa who immigrated from ireland when he was 18 this video is hilarious and it makes me miss my family back there
The Irish accent can be summarized as you walk from your house for ten minutes you find three or so new native accents not including any accents from different parts just moved there.
I love how Seán translates what I hear as jibberish. Love you Seán🤣
Im Jamaican and relate to this on another level
make new minecraft sires pleas for the boys and girls
How does the sheep man sound exactly like shaun (sorry cant put the thing over a)
Women: “perk” “Gerden”  Jack: “PARK” “GARDEN”
I really hope Jack plays Bugsnax one of these days since it’s a pretty chill game and I think he would really enjoy it, he liked Slime Rancher so I guess it’s his kind of game
Now I wanna watch Wild Mountain Thyme with me mum who used to live in Ireland and also she doesn’t even like Emily blunt so
I work for a global company. in Dec 2018 and Feb 2019 I had the pleasure of flying to Ireland to work for a few weeks with some colleagues. I had to really focus on listening in order to understand at first, but the more you listen, the more you pick up. What was nice was going to one of my coworker's home for family dinner with them. It made a stressful few work weeks really nice. So, I will say, it just takes time. the more you hear it, the easier it gets to understand. Sean, your accent at first seemed heavy. After the past few years, not so much. Plus, I think the Scottish accent can be even harder to understand.
The World: Can you say "Top o' the mornin' to ya"?  Jack and every Irish person: *No ❤*
It’s all because of the amazing Niall Horan and you!!!!!
Farty-five in Irish actually means just five, but five of the less valuable ones (‿|‿)
Can you understand a co. Tyrone accent ? 😂
Tuam the fastest town in Ireland
Love your ascent Jack and I never have a problem understand you. In the whole video, the only one I had a real problem understanding was Brad Pitt. For me it more a problem with understanding some of the dialects.
Seán: *Sees the video that’ll teach you an Irish accent* Kinda sus... *Actually watches the video* Hella sus
Petition to make the Irish accent a separate language sign with your name.
I saw this type of video at CallMeKevin
I've been listening to the Dubliners music every now and again, I like how Ronnie Drew spoke. Real gravelly and chill. Then there's accents like Cait from Fallout 4, or the Lucky Charms leprechaun, not bad
Frostbit boy is a national treasure 😂😂😂 he was a meme a few years ago
There comes a point when it’s not an accent anymore lol
Watch the movie the young offenders tis a class 1
Why does that guy sound like the beginning of pretty fly for a white guy
Thank you for translating.                              - The Americans
Is It Possible to Perfect The Irish Accent?
Yo Hot Fuzz was hilarious
Not even gonna lie.  I have no idea what they're saying.  It's like the videos where a scot or a brit talks in a deep accent with slang, and you catch like... 2 words of it.  "Wait, they're speaking the same language?  The hell you say?"
So,I bet 2 family packs You won’t see this
I loved every single bit of this.
My uncle has an irish acent i cant understand him :|  (he is from cork)
You insult our similar culture? The both celts?
"GO BACK TO BED CHILD START DRINKING MORE MILK B**CH" 🤣🤣🤣              THAT HAD ME DIEING 🤣🤣🤣
Where all the junkies? “Ahhh sure givas a yaroo chickie “
I like how that lady in the video "How to do an Irish Accent" has 51K likes and jack has 90K, she also has 2.5K dislikes while jack has 273
you got me Jack. I'll subscribe.
Guys we need to get Jack to decipher Zane from Borderlands 3's accent. that dude has the best dialogue.
Irish accents to me just sound like A very strong  Scottish accent
Sean has lost his accent I think from being on youtube.  It isn't as strong unless he is playing with other Irish gamers.
I tink I like de Kerry accent better den de rest
its so funny how u guys get sheep missing on your news and in america, news is just: ANOTHER GENOCIDE HAS BEEN CITED TODAY IN A PIZZA HUT AND WAS CAUSED BY A TWIG, BLM IN OUTRAGE!
chawmukloghlahn
I...wha... Jack translate i dont understand a word xDD  Some of the not heavy ones i get but the really thick accents.... They re just a different language xD
try understanding an Australian accent or even harder a Australian bogan accent
me:*can bearly hear the Irish accent* my friend:"why do you what the guy with the Irish accent listening to other people with really heavy Irish accents" me:"you hear the accent" my friend :"........you don't " me:"n-no" my friend:"....how" me:"no fucking clue"
I understood every word... having Irish family helps!
This video is now my favorite video of all time
More. More! MORE!  *MORE!*
Sean’s grays in his hair are gorgeous. I was thinking about how he used to speak back when I first watched hm and looking how old he is now. HE AGED LIKE A FINE WINE, NO ONE TALKS ABOUT THIS!!! Anyways, Sean’s gorgeous.
Why did he sound like Arnold Schwarzenegger at 2:20
I am Irish and when he said all the Irish people watching are cringe I immediately agreed
Say "laddies and lasses, lasso the masses, of horses with glasses. The fastest gets mastifs, while great uncle reyses, takes 'em and eats 'em for breakfast" 5 times fast in an irish accent.
I’m irish and am struggling to understand what he saying. And if u think that’s bad don’t go to cork or Donegal or Belfast
You should watch Hardy Bucks. It's this absolutely hilarious Irish sketch show. It started as a web series, but then it became a whole show. Kinda short though.
Jack can u continue the walking dead saints and sinners U make the best videos
interesting/random fact my towns accent was votes as one of the hardest to replicate
Now Seán, I'm officially revoking your Irish passport, the fucker with the 'plastic bag on his head and a knife' at 19:53 is fuckin Blind Boy from The Rubber Bandits, an Irish staple! How, as a fellow Irishman could you not know that one now?
Jack: every town in Ireland is different  Yes Sean it’s called a dialect
Honestly, I just see Ireland as sheep farms and plains
Mirror is a hard word... ;_;
Dude Irish isn’t an accent it’s a whole other language at this point
I feel like it got voted the hottest accent because of all the Outlander fangirls lol
i was really hoping sean was gonna react to the *frostbite* video because my teacher showed me it and sean is irish heh
Anytime someone asks me to do an Irish accent now I’m just gonna do Christopher Walken😂
Sir when will you play fnaf security breach?
This was amazing
“WHAT THE FUCK JEFF”
No one:  Me:  Hehe... farty-fife...
Wait do you speak Gaelic?
These accents sound a bit too Scottish. As someone who's accent will flicker between American, Scottish, and Irish, as well as having Irish DNA, I can say this ain't Irish.
There's no way that farmer was speaking english. If it had to be translated, its a language all of it's own XD
As someone extremely accent deaf, I feel like I'm being whooshed through this whole video.
Well Sean how are ye. Im from Ireland and I was watching this video and my ma started talkin to me and as i responded my accent sounded 10x more Irish than it had. I become more Irish while listening to Irish people.😂👍👍
WTF. When I heard this irish farmer speak, I thought for one second, he speaks low German xD For everybody who doesn't know: Low German is a german dialect spoken in the north of Germany near the coast and apperently is closely related to Frisian and English
Ah those cork boys, make me miss my grampfer (that's how he pronounced it) when he used to rant he needed subtitles but damn was he hilarious!!
all i heared from the guy wit te mad accent was "theres 45 sheep missing "
Seán, can you resume or restart superliminal since you’ve never made a second episode.
Scotland dose not eat shit England dose
Genuinely tried to understand the strong Irish accent but.... I just couldn’t 😂
Is it good that I'm part Irish, and because of watching Jack, am starting to get a slight accent? 😂
Who else would love to watch him react to foil arms and hog?
I feel like this every time I see someone talk Spanish in a show when the actor doesn't natively speak it. Which is in about 1 of every 4 shows now.
"SAVE YOUR BREATH FOR COOLING YOUR PORRIDGE" IS MY FAVORITE LINE OF ANYTHING SAID EVER.
Jack: let's listen to bad and/or very strong Irish accents Me, a maritime Canadian: Sounds like Newfie to me... 👀
I thought new Zealand was voted sexiest accent in the world, also tom cruise and nicole Kidman did a pretty go irish accent in far and away, but then again tom does have irish in him
The guy on the thumbnail : " *Hold my beer* "
Being Canadian and working with newfies all day has made me impervious to impossible to understand accents. You  haven't lived until you've been told a three hour long story by an 80 year old guy from Newfoundland Lord tunderin!
Is this video exclusive to the Gaelic warriors?      (Scotland and Ireland)
Okay but 4 hours ago is early for me
Let's be honest, if they've cast Christopher Walken as an Irish man, it means they've just given up going in 😄
The only one I couldn't understand really was the guy who had his sheep stolen 😂
Yo Jack funny lol
jack: say mirror  me: mirrrr jack:mirrrr
No matter how old Seán gets his channel will NEVER die and will always be funny like if u agree
What i understood throughout the video     Nothing, it looks like that scenario when you are with your friends, your brother comes and you 2 start talking in your own language or something like that and your friends are like:"Da fuck were you 2 talking about?"
I live in Wales so I don’t have much trouble understanding thick Irish accents :)
I have an american accent which is literally the most boring
Bring back jacksepticeye funniest home videos
An irishman laughing at other varying levels of irish accents he may or may not be able to understand for 20 minutes made my day
Irish people speaking English are like Austrian people speaking German
Me favourite is the cork accent coz of young offenders 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Jacksepticeye: Irish people don't say "tap in the morning to ya" Jacksepticeye intro: Tap In The Mornin' To Ya
I'm from Wexford (south east Ireland) and as far as the accents go Wexford is the most basic and understandable , to me that is . But Jesus there are so man that scale from a slight twang to "ah hare bi hwatcha ohnnn bout"
That O'Shea man is not speaking with an accent, that's a completely different language 🤣 how does Jack even understand what he's saying
Me knowing I'm Irish before watching Jacksepticeye: Okay, dope  Me Knowing I'm Irish after watching Jacksepticeye: DING DING DING! IRISH NOISES!!!!!!!!!!
You should watch peaky blinders. They have some great Irish accents
Agreed. Irish accent is the sexist.
"Why didn't they just cast an Irish person" - this is the eternal question for all casting in movies. Maybe 60 years ago it made sense but planes exist and are common now. Just cast the people who are what your character is whenever possible.
I love this video haha
This movie is based on my granny no 🧢
Oh my god Sean, it's like you've been practicing. You're a natural at the Irish accent
Would you be well 😂😂 does Seán not know the rubber bandits tho? 😂
Glad seeing you again Irish potato man
Me: haha this is like that scene in Hot Fuzz- Jack: I feel like that scene in Hot Fuzz Great minds think alike, but fools seldom differ :) we smooth brain
Can’t wait to see a film portraying Bristolians. Only problem will be that the film will be about farmers and pot heads
Narrative of Self is the result of a feedback loop between “Separate Self” & Cosmos ⭕️
I hate to tell you this, but I started watching you cause listening to an Irish/british/austrailia person cursing is the BEST fucking thing.
No,I know Hot Fuzz is jacks favorite movie. But I'm just impressed at the way he knows the lines by heart, including the gibberish Filch says
Jack just want to let you know that subnautica below zero got an update i think u should play it
It’s not hard to understand if your Irish
12:13 the video is called “an” Irish accent, not “the” Irish accent, she is just doing one possible accent, don’t go too hard on her
Somebody notice video 4690 haha funny number
I’m American and even I found this utterly painful.
This is like listening to those songs that are designed to sound like how English sounds to non-speakers. Like you think you can make sense of it, but then nope it's gone.
John Wayne once played an Irish character in a movie set in Ireland. He didnt even need to try an Irish accent tho cause he was returning to Ireland from America 🤷🤣
the way jack says herb hehe
mountain thyme= needs a good looking male irish lead the film= casts someone with most likely an awful fake irish accent  michael fassbende, a perfectly smexy irish man = am i a joke to you
This video made me laugh out loud so hard I snorted Let's go, fellows with accents! XD
Who else waiting for him to get to 30.0M?
I hate to inform you but as of this year, english is the sexiest and Irish is the 4th SORRy
If he doesn't look at the video "the strongest Irish accent you'll ever hear" then I'll eat flamin' hot Cheetos like cereal  Edit: welp, my stomach is going to hate me..
I can’t drink milk Jack I’m lactose intolerant :c
Djdhdjdcbdjdhndbd Brighton Gdgdjsvdjdb Elytra
If a Irish is having a bad day can you give them a potato to make them happy?
I love to see, as a french people, that in an Irish dedicated video, you have the colors of our french flag in the background of your room xD
Is the sheep guy speaking even english?!
am i the only one who enjoyed the way jack pronounces the word "thick"
This makes me smile
I'm Irish and people say I sound American or British.
I'm not Irish, im American, but how's she cuttin, Jack?
Nothing gets my juices flowing like a well done Irish accent from Sëan McLean
I absolutely ADORE the Irish accent. I can listen to it all day long! Want to hear a retarded accent go listen to an afrkaanse poppie speak... CRINGE. Im not the biggest fan of South African accents. But this right here was AWESOME!!!! 😘😘
It sounds like a whole new language when they speak 😂😂
Wild mountain thyme is basically a mix of British and Irish they try at least but they just butcher it not to bad But my best was the Irish farmer the second it started was the second I died watching the original video.
Play Darksiders i beg you
Why is it sometimes that his eyes turns orange. Like Sage Mode from Naruto
Ah jaysus da was fierce craic hey. Mad shtuff ya aul bollox. Sure your welcome back to yon mother land Jack. Just make sure ya bring da bickies
I loved it, great video. I'm going to send it to all my friends.
I somehow understood all of them p-p
In Snatch the character actually say in he beginjing this dude doesn't have an Irish accent
I've also noticed that some say FOCK, and some say FECK
People really don't get that a country has a lot of accents lol. I had a french friend who decided to learn my language (Swedish),  because he was really into this 1 artist who was singing in Swedish.  He then begged me to speak in my language to him, but as soon as I opened my mouth he was like "no. That's not Swedish."  because our accents were too different, he's now convinced their accent is Danish instead LOL. (AND THATS WHY WE'RE NOT FRIENDS ANYMORE jk)
2:20 lmao jack sounded like Groo 😂😂
My phone screwed with me and made me think i wasn't subscribed i nearly was disappointed in my self😅
Kevin couldn’t understand the man from the sheep interview a few months ago 😂😂
Heads up. I'm not sure you want to be focussing on your subscriber to non-subscriber rate. If your viewers were 100% subscribers you probably wouldn't be getting any new viewers (as none of your audience would be non-subscribers) and therefore no one to become new subscribers. How many are converting to subscribers over time might be a better metric. Say you had 10million non-subscriber viewers and 2 million of those converted, that could be good as long as you're constantly feeding new traffic to your channel
Christopher Walken trying to be Irish is like Gilbert Gottfried trying to sound like Morgan Freeman.
This is what I heard from the farmer. "There were farty five sheep hssjhdb djfbdak bdudixnsn djfhdudk sheep hdheisndn sheep djsjwhvddhh. What can you do about it? Nothing
I’m from Northern Ireland and I was having to proper concentrate to try under that sheep farmer and still couldn’t make out half of what he way saying 😂😂
I fel he Irish in me American blood awek
I'm Irish and I barely understood to be fair I'm from the border right next to northern Ireland so me accent ain't that heavy
Haven't watched yet but is it justaminx for the whole video
As an Irish-man I can confirm I had not fucking clue what your man was talking about when it came to the sheep farmer
Okay, so when Jack asked if we could understand the man with the lost sheep, I turned full theatre kid and just listened. If I'm honest with you, I only understood some because we've only been studying Irish accents for a week or so, but I'm glad it's paying off!
The school boy looks like a cross between gman and a who.
You should've watched the man who interviewed the old man in a pub in Killarney 🤣
As an irish american whose also 25% Italian, i can say that both accents are sexy
Could jack understand the thickest Irish accent ever?
Just makes me want to watch Derry Girls again
9:20 10 liters of water holy jesus.
That one sheep guy isn’t even speaking English😂
"Drink some more milk BITCH!" 😂
This is why I want to live in Ireland. I love America and the accents here but nothing can beat an Irish accent. 😂
Hey guys hivesswap chapter two comes out on the November 25 2020
0:42 i was literally drinking milk while he said that
made me laugh a bit too much
That video for the Irish farmer losing his sheep was played by my history teacher 2 weeks ago, and I was shocked
The schoolboy’s accent is a mix with Minnesotan Irish and a tiny hint of Canadian.  Sadly, I understood it a lil bit.  Your accent is still there, but not as THICC as molasses having a race with a tortoise.  Now when you do get upset or angry, the accent gets thicker.  I am a sucker for an accent. Shush 🤐 😉 🤫  Sean, much love to ya hun.
when jack says "he had a rock tyed to his neck" he sounded like Arnold Schwarzenegger
Please play hollow knight jack😀
Hmm yes, that is in deed a bad case of Irish accent
12:58 My Auntie whenever my Uncle Jeff leaves the toilet seat up at home
I wanna see him listen to a thick southern or NYC/Boston accent to see if he can understand it
Fuck man. Well, I think I found the English equivalent of Bedewian Arabic
This is like when people talk to droids and they somehow understand them
Wow, Saun is great at doing an Irish accent.
"start drinking more milk bitch!" (-Jacksepticeye 2020-)
Jack you say herb as erb you don’t say the h
This is just people belittling Seàn's entire country
I believe in the country areas of many countries the accents are the strongest ...like in the Caribbean for instance or new jersey or Even some new Yorks
your apology is accepted jack
Omg the last vowel bender. Grant me thine powers o mighty septiceye
not sure if its been brought up before, but newfies (people from Newfoundland in Canada) are known to have a similar accent to the irish, would be interesting to see if you can understand them
19:22 I didnt know he paused the video he was watching lol
"every town has a different accent"  yeah I get that, but strong regional diversity is part of pretty much every language, is it not? Im german and I got trouble understanding people 60km north from me :D
holy crap, when I have a severe migraine I mumble. THIS is how I sound!  My brothers always get pissed cuz they think I do it on purpose. I am not even Irish. I get it now.
The funniest thing is i understood most of what the lad with the ship was sayin do to the fact i use to live out in the country  Also all irish people dont say go for a poop we all say i need a shite
Here, quick Irish accent lesson, from an Irish lad. Say: Whale Oil Beef Hooked. There ye go. G'wan now, bye-bye-ba-ba-ba-buh-bye.
this made me think of kevins video when he watched random irish news videos love it!
8:15 Froshbutt
Brad Pitt's accent is ICONIC YA TICC LOOMPE
no one asked but the spiderman ps4 has new suits can you react to them?
That sounds like my uncle 🤣🤣🤣
I hate the dublin accent
Honestly Australian and Irish accents are the things in this world that get me the closest to being gay
Now I really want Seán to make a video about the Irish language.
I could understand most of what the dude was saying, but there were still moments where I was like “Mmmmm what now?”
I was down in cork twice and  I could hardly understand what they were saying. And some of the people in my own county , Fermanagh, I can hardly understand!
People making irish accents: iM iRisH hElLo
i just saw that you have gray hair ur old man
Brads is actually pretty solid
Welcome to the comment section young ones!
10:13 does she consider mumble rap to be music?
I can only understand the farmer cause that's my grandfathers tone who happened to be a farmer
I am absolutely offended he didn’t look up Sir Stevo Timothy
Hi
All I want is Irish news after 2020
I hope he's seen markipliers impression of him
Check out foil arms and hog they are the second best Irish channel I have ever watched
I can't even do a Irish accent I can do a Scottish accent but I'm not sure about Australia
me every time Jack speaks in an Irish accent:  👁👄👁  i absolutely love it tho
Why did Cristopher Walken when trying to do Irish accent sound like a bad impression of Arnold Schwarzenegger
“They’re were 45 sheep missing and-and the lambs too just gone, gone ya know” was all i vaguely understood
I really didn’t find any Irish accent attractive until I heard Jacksepticeye speak and then I couldn’t look back.
Now I want jack to start a accent review
Ummm I can understand him 😱 kind of lol. Oh god the rowers are hilarious and I'm from Cork 🤣 fuck sake they had to show a clip of Cobh for County Cork 🙄🤣
I’m 86% Irish but I don’t have a Irish accent :/
Ayo, ello from co.Kilkenny!!
How could ya Jerry
love that he watched the one of yer man from Antrim
“START DRINKIN MORE MILK BITCH” *insert cartman crying audio*
I'm from Norway and understand surprisingly noise
English isn't my mother tongue so don't ask me whether you have an accent,  but this was way   hilarious and even a tad bit educational. Thanks for the good laughs :D Also kinda proud I could decipher a few words in there but without a translation  most of it would have gone way over my head xD
regarding the sheep video, the second dude wasn't actually that hard to understand, but i had to listen to the first dude two or three times after you translated what he said to actually hear it.
why did some of the accents sound vaguely West Indian to me...
When Your from Dublin you don’t pronounce your t’s
I like the cork accent, they sound like they're living the life
“I’m a vowel bender” 😂
Oi, I subscribed Jack, I've done it. Sorry it took a weebit of thyme. It's darn.
the amount is of times that “eat shit, France” has been said is probably ridiculous lol
I can understand it just fine i dont know what your. Talking about
He sure do a boston Irish accent video there borcked
Swedish is 7th?  Lagomt.
As a Canadian I swear if Emily blunt lowered her pitch in her irish accent a little bit she would have sounded like she had a thick Canadian accent
The auld one wasn't that hard to understand
I live in carlow and we even have our own words
when he said "i just say 'mirr', it's just M-I-and 15 Rs", i felt that 😂
irish accents are so diverse i cant understand my neighbour of 20 years and he cant understand me Edit: I think my home town of balinaboola is actually the most Irish named town
*me, having heard many Asian accents that was very hard to understand*       what the actual fuck
"Drink more milk Bitch!"   Me: *Sitting here with hit chokki milk*  ;^;
I would love it if Sean watched Ryan's Daughter, and hear what he has to say, since most of the leads in that film were English; except Americans Mitchum and Jones (who was dubbed in the film), and Australian McKern, who didn't even seem to try to do an Irish accent.  However, a lot of the villagers were performed by actual Irish actors and actresses.
Irish Appreciation video, peak of my day
The Irish accent is the sexiest sound right after corpses voice.
Is it just me or is everything that they say sound like gibberish? Like I didn’t get anything
How can you judge the actors when even you dont sound / speak irish 🤨
When will the next ep of satisfactory come out did you forget about it jack
i cant even understand accents very well and this sheep dude is on a whole new level! dude sounds like he's speaking backwards
Americans: how many states are their  Irish ppl who have to learn all the county's off by heart in English and Irish
My great grandfather was Irish and my grandfather is also Irish so I'm a tad bit Irish but I can't even understand these people
Jack i know what you mean. We are special. I might not be irish, but i know what you mean.
Galic Gladiators
12:53 THATS MY COUSIN JEFF HOLY SHIT !!!
3:55 Brad Pit is a himbo confirmed.
10:25 it sounded like she was just saying Oil
:0:42
Hey jack do you know after 30 genocide runs in undertale you face a new opponent gaster
Down the Irish rabbit hole we go
"How to do an Irish accent" I've never cringed so much 😂😭
Finley's accent is fake... I've seen him get mad, and he's lose his accent
:0:42 hood get on that you could have the best marketing ever.
i laughed at the part where you said you'd translate for us because whenever any of the irish side of the family would visit, my (canadian) mother could never understand a single bit of what was being said, so someone would always have to "translate" for her
The shepherd's accent reminds me of that Norwegian comedy sketch of the Danish not being able to understand each other, or the video of how English sounds to non-speakers.
Jack's accent by himself: wek Jack's accent when around or talking about other irishmen: stronk
I could barely understand the lad who lost his sheep, got to love a good ol' Kerry accent.  Me personally I'm a Tipperary lad,  I'm from Carrick-On-Suir and like Seán said, every town has it's own accent. Also your one who tried to teach people how to do an Irish accent was shite, she was trying way to hard.
as a scot i don't mind losing sexiest accent to the Irish but i call BS on losing to Italian. >:(
dose jack have eyeshadow  on
Cork is by far the sexiest Irish accent. I'm biased since I'm from there,but all Irish accents are great in their own right. Tiocfaidh ár lá.
listen i thought i could listen to Scottish accents pretty well but Irish??? no way. i thought i was having a stroke when that guys accent- when he just-
Jack watching terrible faux-irish movies to laught at how wrong they got it is sort of like professional fighters watching fight-scenes, or real-life spies watching James Bond, to laugh at how -unrealistic- _shit_ it all is.
“YA WOULDN’T BE LONG GETTIN’ FROSHBUTT”
Video reminds me of Boomhoer from king of the hill XD
That 'sexiest accent' list is NOT credible, we Aussies at number 5? No way 😂
And Boondock Saints
Only 500,000 views? This dumb shit deserves more.
watching this video well doing irish homework
I needed this from you 😂😂😂
Well what do you think about the movie trainspotters
For April fool's jack should record a full video in irish
also, here in Nova Scotia, there are people that sound very Irish. we pronounce things like "car" "Irish" "About (which is actually a-boat not aboot" which sounds like a subtle irish sound
keep it in the blind fold jeff!!!!!!!!!
How could anyone understand Irish accent? If you could understand the irish accent then you're a God.
Im sorry but, actually, the new Zealand Accent is the sexiest in the world: Kiwi accent New Zealand voted as the world's sexiest accent  According to an extensive poll conducted by Big 7 Travel, the Kiwi accent is "outrageously charming", and officially the sexiest in the world.Jul 23, 2020
ah, this video was too short :')
Ah the bun looks good today
Loving when I hear the differences in accents from Ireland
I have a t shirt of irland in limerick
Drink your milk bish
See the guy in the pub please I beg you
Ngl actually understood alot of this
Watch war of the buttons
Cork sounds like my Mom's family but a bit stronger, so it's the easiest one for me to get.
I felt that when he said "naight withiln dobeldun outabyun alermsaabin"
Those Irish farmers sound like old people who made their own language up but based it on English.
“Go drink more milk” as I poor myself a drink of straight milk.....
For some reason I can understand Irish people I am also part Scottish UwU
How did Australia not win sexiest accent? Maybe they misunderstood the entry. Not no crocodile Dundee. I'm talking hemsworth.
That “vowelbender* joke got me a lot more than it should have
This made me want to watch Father Ted again sooo much
Even tho I'm an american I am very good at an irish accent and a couple more to actually
I watched Kevin react to some of these clips and he couldnt understand em either
The Brad Pitt one I was just like pARDON?
Isth thernan galak isha minshun et t'me wuif.
im swedish and is this realy enlish
Quick tip people with hard irish accents cannot say 33
Man Im from Kerry and this is too accurate
You sound like jack
11:26 I think she was doing a Dublin accent at the start cause she pronounced things the way I do. My accent is apparently super strong cause every time I talk to a foreigner or someone from another county they immediately know from from Dublin and sometimes where in Dublin.( I'd rather not say online if you heard my voice and were from the area you'd know) county
You should do the Bristolian accent
Is this about wild mountain thyme? Please be about wild mountain thyme
Irish accents are basically just Jack's not so heavy Irish accent, but spoken by a drunken man who speaks really fast.
I'm from kilkenny so my accent isnt that strong compared to some places in ireland but people not from ireland would notice it.
fuck Irish accent, ill rather speak Irish
My grandparents are originally from Ireland, I am not. Born American but mostly raised by them. Gran taught me to use both my accents which is really hard to remember. If I had to guess, my Irish side sounds a little like Jack but a touch lighter due to the "burgers and beer" side. It's a touch embarrassing when I get into a fighty mood.
In the video 'Guide to Irish Accents' it looks like you didn't pick up on during the Limerick accent that they guy was supposed to be one of the Rubber Bandits from RTE, a comedy duo.
I wonder where Jack is from in Ireland!!
Jack literally just thought me how to understand these accents, I have been awakened. Thanks Jack
this cracked me up
The Olympians HAD to be high! :D
6:17 It sounds like he's saying "those f***ing white sheep"
So we just gonna ignore the fact that Sean just said Irish people don't say 'Top of the morning to ya' whilst wearing a shirt that says Top of the Mornin? 😂😂
the hell?! I didn't know Ireland had "Spar" so weird Ô-o
if you hear irish once its hard to understand but listen too a few and it starts to acute your ears to the language.
I loved this video a lot more this week 😂😂 keep it up 🥰🥰
Can weeee siee yo gorl in a vid sume time me ladie?
I deadass searched for his Irish videos today, and here it is! he uploaded another today. 😱😂
I got surprised when they showed st Finbarrs but that's the only thing they could show
The farmer sounds like every English listening test
I can kinda understand what there say but there is a part of me that doesn't understand At the same time
Oilland
Me, a Slav who barely even knows English...
listening to anyone with an irish accent imitate someone else with a different irish accent is the most confusing thing I have ever heard lol
at the beginning when jack said "hurbs" instead of herbs lmao
sounds german, that man with the lost sheeps lmao
I would like to see you play hand simulator survival it’s just Minecraft but you know... hand simulator
Sounds more scottish then Irish._.
mmmmmmmmm Grizzy mmmmmmmmmm
Do a reaction to fluffy pretending to be Irish !!!!
jack wheres LAUGH? i am feeling very sad theese days i lost all my progress in a game and lost my chance at having a girlfriend
I need more of this🤣🤣
From the South of the Kingdom myself. Yeah you do get some strong accents down here. By the way when you talked about people doing an impression of you I think they are focusing on your early intro 'Top of the morning...' you do have a bit of a change to your accent but I believe that was on purpose back then. The video about 'How to do an Irish Accent' I think that is the TV version of Irish Accents. At least you pointed out the different counties have different accents and in some cases some counties can have multiple different accents.
Petition to have Sean watch the try channel
18:53 The Chad of the Irish lol 🤣🤣
there's also some of us who didn't pick up a specific accent bc we grew up on the border between two counties
Fun AND educational! :D
I come from Scottish descent and fully get not being able to understand Scottish people. My friends couldn't ubderstand my dad and I could,but I couldn't understand my Grandmother at all, her accent was so heavy.
I loved it
Lol this video is called being homesick. I do the same thing with novelas when I miss Dominican Republic ☹🥴🤣
💕💕🙏Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare/Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Hare Hare🙏 💕💕
Yes
Being part Irish, Irish accents are music to my ears lol
15:30 is not what Louth people sound like. They either sound Very Northern Irish, Very Dublin or both put together
Jack translates heavy accents  Me: Really?! It was way off than what he's saying
I really wish I was more irish
My brain kind of stopped working with the sheep guy.. I tried to understand what he was saying but it sounded like he's talking german but it wasn't :D
It's great to know my country isn't the only one with more than 50 accents
The captions are unavailable for this video 😂😂
After seeing Jack's reaction to different Irish accents makes me want to see how he'd react to a Newfie accent since it's the Canadian equivalent to the Irish accent
The most sexy accent Is corpse
teaching irish: say perk, gerden,  jack, an actual irishman: perk,gerden,   im great at this!
at 11:21 why is jack learning his language again. lol
Rowena from supernatural
a thick irish accent sounds like swedish.
The 1st guy in the newscast about the sheep I had trouble understanding, but I didn't have trouble understanding the 2nd guy, Richie Green, at all.

When he said garden I just heard rather Jack Hacket hahaha
7:51 that's 2013 Sean
Anytime jack does a video about Ireland it’s just: *Irish accent intensifies*
Day1 of asking jack to bring back the old intro
Ngl, a bit disappointed that the Donegal accent wasn't featured but Louth of all counties was. (Sorry louth)
Australian is the worst of all English
More Funniest home videos 😢
I feel like Sean sometimes doesn't sound Irish, or it just becomes normalized to my ears.
this whole video to me i just heard gibberish😂
Is it just me or does that old shepherd look like Tom Hanks
*IRISH INTENSIFIES*
Most Irish people want to watch Wild Mountain Thyme... you're not alone, we want to take the piss out of it
My mom was pretending to do the irish accent while I was playing this on the TV
"what the FUCK Jeff?!"
Can u play more silence bc ur lady vid on it was frikin halarious
LOVE FROM PAKISTAN SEÁN🇵🇰🇵🇰🇵🇰🇵🇰🇵🇰
Can confirm Cork has a very strong accent
I needed his video three weeks ago when I made a presentation on Irish English.
how can I understand them I'm from Texas.
I don't know how much russian speaking people watch this channel, but for us Brad Pitt didn't play Irish in that movie
Which accent I liked best: yours Jackaboy. Love your accent ;w;
He pronounced herbs with the 'h'  Not you too Sean
im proud to be irish      *wait im the other ones on that list too*
I've never been able to tell the difference between the Newfie accent and Irish accents. Then the bit from the rowers from Cork happened and I had my answer. Apparently Newfie just sounds like Cork to me. Ya learn something new every day I guess
You should so do a Welsh accents video, you'd be amazed.
Brad Pitt isn’t playing an Irishman he plays a gypsy, in the words of the movie itself “it’s not quite English and it’s not quite Irish”
its official jacksepticeye is gone in his place Sean. Where did the intro go?
Hello love the videos keep up the great work 👍
As someone from louth, people here either sound like theyre from northern dublin, or a bunch of mixed dialects thrown together 💀
IRELAND IRELAND TOGETHER STANDING TALL  Co. LOUD
How the f does jack understand the sheep guys . Look man ik he's irish but sheesh!!
I spent two weeks in Ireland, we went from Dublin to Cork to Kerry to Galway. I had whiplash from all the accents I had to get used to 😂
I freaking love Irish.
I thought it was a Irish accent this is a whole nother language
You have a better british accent than me and I'm british
Mickey from snatch is HILARIOUS
Low key Newfoundlander.
I am Irish and I can't understand that sheep fella......
I think the best Irish voice is yours Sean. I lived the UK for about a year and had a few Irish friends could hardly understand them but your voice is awee bit clearer.
My granddad was Cork and I never thought anything of his accent. It might have been singy rather than how some of these from Cork sound a bit "dopey" hahaha. I also once served an old man from Kerry and you literally had no idea what he was saying xD
South African accent be like bruh
The Kerry Irish accent sounds a lot like the Hoi Toid accent from the outer banks of North Carolina. It is Elizabethan English with some Irish and Scottish tones mixed in. These kinds of accents exist due to very little outside influence. In the case of Hoi Toid, these were fishing villages who weren't really visited by outsiders until the 20th century. I have a feeling Kerry is mainly farming communities that stay relatively isolated. Both of these accents will eventually die out due to the exposure of the modern world.
The two rowers live near me haha
Brad Pitt playing an Irish Traveller is just gold in my opinion
the best accent is the accent from the french part of Canada also called "Quebecois"
HOw feckin dare you do a video on Irish accents and not cover the actual sexiest irish accent, Female Donegal. Now if you want back in Ireland you and me will have to have a box
the 2020 survey says that scotish is the sexiest... theyre obviously wrong and rigged
I just realised that its an Irish man reacting to Irish men
Ok legit were the dudes who won the silver medal even moving their mouths when talking? I swear the dude with the sheep was mumbling to a point i dont think he was speaking english
tou have like between brittish and irish accent
I'm impressed that Sean understood that guy
Irish accents are really fun to listen to. I didn’t realize there were so many different accents though. It’s the same with the south in the US. And not even just the south. Texas alone has so many different accents. I think that the general American accent is really boring, which is the one I have.
Either I'm crazy, or that's the lovely sound of John Sharpson in that "Guide to Irish Accents" video.
Where’s me lucky charms?
i dont care who goes against me snatch is one of the best movies on earth
It's like how I feel when people say Namaste in the weirdest ways and in weird settings! 😂😂
I'm not Irish and I'm cringing
American accent in reality: *normal*  American accent to everyone else: PAK THE CA IN HAVAD YAD
limerick was the rubberbandits Sean, the geniuses behind horse outside XD
😂😂😂😂Im dying with the translations 6:00 This just became my favorite video
had fun also thank you Sean Bean
I am sorry in advance, but to anyone with a strong Irish accent like that sheep farmer your manner of speech is set to "drunk" 24/7. That's just what it sounds like. Nothing but slurring. 😂
Jack Brad Pitt is a traveler in that
I have friends from Cork and I love their accent so much, they pronounce beagles as baygles!
Ok i can understand most accents but what the fuck did this farmer just say
🤣🤣
I literally fucking live in park and no one but that man sounds like that he's a local hero went to lumen Christi college and that is a real accent
Idk I really liked the Irish accent best
The fact that this video was harder for me to understand than BTS speaking Korean is hilarious😂
Is it rude to laugh? 😂
I can't even understand half of this without caption. I'm hard of hearing with tinnitus on top of it, honestly it all sounds like one long word.
Watching this makes me think more about the different accents not just around the world, but even just in America. A few weeks ago I did a video chat with an online friend, and one of the first things they mentioned was they noticed my southern accent 😂 makes you really think about how you sound when talking to people who aren’t from the same area as you
I wonder what he would think about Secret of the Cave. An American kid goes to stay with his aunt and uncle in Ireland because his dad has to do business trip stuff and gets dragged into a mystery. It's a student film done in 2006 by university students.
Hi Im irish and this is fUCKIN HILARIOUS i didnt think i had a distinct accent but this is making me have second thoughts
After watching sheep guy a few times I think I became an Irish Accent-English Accent translator     I'm really Irish from Rhode Island ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
JACK! TEACH US IRISH ACCENTS!!!!
I'm the 450,610th viewer :>
No one posts videos about Kilkenny, the best county 😢
why does Irish sound like a remix of English and Austrian accent at the same time
Jack, I hope you watch Juice Box for You on youtube
did u ever go to the debs
This was a trip to watch!!  So glad you watched the Facts video!!
I need an auto-translate for this video to understand what they are saying
5:41 I’m also Irish and this sounds like he’s speakin another language “if it was idk ;-;)
"Most sexiest in the world"  And then there's Nogla.
Irish and Scottish are ties for my two favorite accent due to someone who appears on drumsy’s channel called Illy, who is Scottish and due to JackSepticEye.
I love how in a lot of irish accents the "th" is said like a T or D sound, meanwhile in Gaelic any word with a "th" is just pronounced like an H. As far as I know anyways, I know the variations in Gaelic pronunciations are ridiculous, i.e. some areas pronounce "mh/bh" like "v" or "w" depending on the letters around it, while Munster (and other areas?) just say "v" regardless.
snatch is on netflix
im surprised he didnt watch his number one boi norman reedus be irish in the boondock saints
Legitimately floored that you could so effortlessly translate that sheepish gentleman, Sean. In any case I love accents so this was delightful.
12:00 this is her 👁👄👁
Normal people: Look in the mirror Irish people: Look in de mirororororrr der
Saiorse Ronan has my favorite Irish accent. When I used to go to church (I live in Florida) my priest was from Ireland and had more of a posh accent that I really couldn’t pin down, but it was super relaxing. It wasn’t the kind of accent that is seen as standard though.
That farmer was speaking Simlish I'm telling you
I dont find irish accen...  WOT DA FOOK!??!!?!
I love how the not Irish people watching jack talk about the counties have no idea what he is going on about
Being irish and watching this vid made me both laugh 🤣 and cringe especially at the bad attempts of  irish accents but also being from Limerick and finding out that  jack went  to school here makes me wonder what he did and we're he went that has me curious now 🤔
The rowers weren’t that hard to understand tbh
This is fucking with my mind  at one point I stopped understanding what jack was saying  then my mom spoke to me and I didn't understand her either. she speaks portuguese.  whares hepenen ?!?!
Pewds and KSI mentioned about a Irish meme collab with Jack, and you prolly wanted to avoid that.
jack is milk gang like if you agree
Sometimes it's painful, as an Irishman, to hear bad Irish accents.
Sorry, but I’m not going to call it Oiland
Jack u need to shave
I’m from Yorkshire in England and got most of what that sheep guy said and everything the guy in hot fuzz said 😂 my accent is pretty strong though
Funny story I've been watching your channel for like 2 years and now sometimes I catch myself saying  a's like á's  you broke me jack
if any one has watched criminal nods you must know of william lemontague/ the husband of jj but anyways they tried to have him play someone who he from louisiana but he’s actually from west virgina and no one can understand what the fuck he is saying half the time because it sounds like he’s doing a really bad irish accent
My grandpa's family came from Ireland and that whole side of my family makes fun of each other all of the time ... Sean's not wrong about that. When grandpa gets angry, that's when his accent is strong because otherwise he's become pretty Americanised. On that side of my family, all of the current children have been given Irish-based names in honor of my grandfather's family.
I gotta say, this rugged, slightly salt-and-pepper look is doing something to me; and that accent, oooh, baby. Is it because of Sean that the Irish accent became the sexiest accent in the world?
U should look at knives out the James Bond guy is in it and he tries to do any American accent and it was shit
🇮🇪
i kinda understud
Brad Pitt said he came up with accent when studying a character in Fr. Ted. Turned out to be "Tom" played by Pat Short.
That guy talking about peeing in a cup is the funniest crap
I love the england accent  and scottish 🥺
I much come clean, that is how we sound in Cork and Co.Cork
I loved the Cork accent, it's so damn funny.
I watch Snapchat
I swear Hollywood never hire people for who are actually that thing. EVER.
My parents are from cork but I have no accent
the sheep farmer is probably related to me, my mums maiden name is oshea and im from kerry omg
“Yeah, I’m a vowel bender” 😂😂😂
When I make a presentation about Ireland, I'll just show this video
I remember the last time I went to Ireland I heard two people that I was so confused about what they were saying. I first thought it was s2 guys that came from Whales because of how un-deniably weird the accent was, but now that I think of it they might have been from Kerry.
Russian accents tho
if i could choose to have one accent from anywhere in the world, it would definitely be an Irish accent
React to Welsh accents, particularly ones from the North!
Jack you should see all the people attempting Australian accents.
when you start understanding
Don’t you mean Unus Annus?
I’m from Newfoundland, honestly the accents can be very similar
You should react to other accents. Maybe a southerly American accent
I’m part Irish and my dad has Irish friends who sound like they’re speaking gibberish
Have to say, if we had to be second to anyone, might as well be second to Irish accents. XD Though Italian accents have the same problem: 20 regions? 20 accents. And 4-5 variations of each accent per region. People do not seem to know and default to a very poor caricature of Neapoltan, which usually ends up to be dreadful to listen to, sooo... Joining the bandwagon of misrepresented accents I guess? XD
You should make a song with Janet devlin she is a Irish musician on YouTube
Christopher Walken does an Irish accent like La Croix does flavor.
13:30 i would love to see the farmers talk in that video
6:54 Richie Griffin looks like an old irish Tom Hanks 😂
My aunt is northern Irish and Half the time I can't understand her.
Seán should teach ksi how to say mural, idk why. Just think itd be funny
jack: "no luck for you, scotland!"  me: "i mean.. they sound more intimidating anyways.."
I don't know why but I liked this video
I'm half Irish but when I get pissed my Irish heritage kicks in with the Limerick accent
Jack, if 100% Irish man Call Me Kevin can't understand the sheep man, what luck do any of us have?
Jack reacting to thick Irish accents is like how we in southern Sweden reacts to the Elfdalian accent. You don't really get half of what they're saying unless you're really good at deciphering it, but you can't help enjoying what it sounds like.
My supervisor at work is Irish from Limerick....I swear to you I would let me read me the phone book and I would swoon!
Lmao, now I want The Quiet Man remade with Walken as the wisened carriage master and Matt le Blanc as whatever part the Duke was playing.
The accent wouldn't be so hard to understand if people would just OPEN THEIR FUCKIN MOUTHS WHEN THEY SPEAK instead of mumbling geez
Minilad watched the one farmer and the school boy 😂
Dye your hair white eivor
YOOOOO FROSTBIT I KNOW HIM!!! He was filmed like 150metres away and he put the accent on in 3rd year and can’t stop. Raurai mcsorley. He is so kind and nice. Especially after his rise to fame!
That's a damn lie a Puertorican accent is the most sexist screw that
You should watch the Graham Norton interview with the two rowing boys, Michael Fassbender and James McAvoy. The combination of all of them together just makes their accents stronger and it is fantastic
Oh no all these fake accents are terrible, that's not how Irish people sound at all! Besides, there are many different Irish accents, why can't people get that right? Meanwhile in among us lobbies: being loud and using glottal stop in every word to emulate British accent xD
Callmekevin did it first
I wonder what his feelings are on the accents in the Boondock Saints?
Flashbacks to when Kevin tried to “translate”
15:32 Good ol' Cobh. I can almost see my house
we have english listening exams and ur like 'alright should be fine' and then they throw in the dude from 5:06
Aha man this is possibly made my day I haven’t laughed soo hard in my life until it showed the farmer lad from Kerry . About 45 sheep 😂😂😂😂😂 aha up MAYO
*meanwhile in Ireland*
I can tell you for a fact that we North Carolinians are about 70/30 on southern accents which often depends on whether we were born and raised in the cities or outskirts. I have at least 80% distant kin and friends of family within a 15-mile radius of Raleigh who can confirm this. The remaining 40% were born and raised in Virginia. A handful of them are about as heavy as Texans.
You sound Irish and I can’t do an Irish accent
Why does Jack always accidentally show the most stereotypical Irish stuff? Seriously guys we are not that different.
Hollywood: We're going to make a regional film. Whatever you do, DO NOT cast anyone from that region. Jacksepticeye: *laughs in fading accent*
When Seán said “WTF JEFF” I got big “WTF KYLE” vibes 😂
Just to remind you Sean, there are people who think they learnt english from watching your videos. Just saying. XD Also feeling proud to be one of the 57% who are subscribed. SUB SQUAD ASSEMBLE!!!
Bruh
As a Kenyan sub . You do sound like a sheep herder, from South Ireland when you talk and laugh..
In thinking about how to do an Irish accent, every town seems to have their own accents and every town has an explanation aboot how to do an Irish accent. I think what ya got der is a contest Jack.
whale oil beef hooked
I'm from Dublin so the Dublin accent but that poor farmer
I'm Black (African American), & I think I can speak to any other Black person in the country & be totally understood, but I feel like it's always interesting to see what terms we use that go global; it's a weird mix of different parts of the country that aren't really spoken in one place. I suppose it's due to rap music primarily, & some terms have become generally accepted, but imagine Lil Wayne, Jay Z, LeBron James, & Snoop having a conversation. (Or just watch The Wire. Yes, I'm old.) The difference in accents is really striking if you think about it.
I’m a Dub but we’ve a family home from where my grandparents were from in the arse end of nowhere Mayo and I remember I brought my friends out there like 2 years ago and we decided to go for a walk. One of the locals was at her gate clearing up and she stopped us for a chat (and the figure out who we were) and I just about managed to keep up with her THICK Maigh Eo accent and chatted to her and my friends didn’t have a fuckin clue what we were on about 😂
Honestly you don’t really have an accent anymore Sean. Only certain words. Your American friends have corrupted you.
There is a kid in my Irish class called Sean mcgloughlin😅
I feel like I'm in a zoom meeting watching him play the trailer
Is it just me who has just like gotten used to Jack's accent that its not there anymore?
My dad is Indian but I was born and raised in Somerset with a Devonshire mum, so I didn't realise how West Country I was until I went to Uni and a lot of my coursemates couldn't understand Arthur Webley from Hot Fuzz the first time but I could XD
19:54 I refuse to believe that Spar isn't a Norwegian store. My life is a damn lie.
I would bet it was straight american men who mostly made the sexiest accent #1 lol. They saw Celtic Women and were sold. I don't think they saw Jack and went "that's like an angel flirting with me!"
as an american, i couldn't understand wtf anyone was saying lol
That farmer guy is speaking the doctors handwriting
Should’ve watched the boondocks saints 😂
8:07 Irish Gman
The Irish a great bunch of lads
JACK PLAY NO MANS SKY VR
Me being like 40 mins from Sean's town in the Midlands looking at the vocal coach noticing how more broad and round the midlands pronounce shit 👁️👄👁️ (we say Ireland like ARE-land)
This was a great video oh my lord
That is not english...
That awkward moment when the Tom Cruise movie Far and Away is my all time favorite movie 😅
11:50 communism has struck again
After a few videos I started understanding everything they were saying!
I've got a super strong Manchester accent so nobody understands me
I understood about half of the irish farmer. I'm Scottish.
Literally in the first TWENTY THREE seconds, Sean insults all of my culture and heritage.... *angry pizza noises intensify*
All the Gaeltacht areas always have a thicker accent ngl
ALL OF THE ACCENTS I LOVE ALL OF THEM
Jack just being a simp for the Irish
Im from skibbereen
.....ok hold on...... yes the accents were either crap, amazing, or hilarious,... but the only thing i could focus on the entire video.... is wondering if jack is wearing eye liner.....eye liner? is that right srry idk make up stuffs.....but there's definitely intense makeup on his upper eyelids.
8:16 FROSTBIT = FROSHBUTT
Learning to do an Irish accent  Of course she’s American
I love your accent.
Sean (can't type the a properly I'm on PC): Laughs at Irish accent. Also Sean: *Sees a 16y/o white chick running to him* "Reply with more memes"
NOOOOOOOO!!!    I need more "Screaming, unintelligeble-talking, no-idea-what-you-just-said, broken human google translate species, NOW!!!
Do more meme times
I know it ain't pure Irish but I love the Newfie accent because it sounds somewhat like North Dublin. All in all I find it to be best kind
is it weird that when ever I hear Sean's voice, that my mind keeps going to "how to make fnaf 3 not scary"? all I think is him as phantom foxy talking about growing up in Dublin where he was a potato farmer and met a pretty lass named Ruby.... anyone else? just me? okie :')... sorry Sean... also, sorry for any grammar and spelling arrears..
Jamie Dornan probably is the only person with a real Irish Accent in the first trailer  I understood most of the accents as I have family in Republic of Ireland   Also I had some Irish teachers when I was in school and I was the only one who understood them lol
My favorite Irish accent is the England one 👁️👄👁️
I was slowly able to understand the accents throughout the video. Anyone else?
Christopher Walken trying to be Irish is the best Christmas gift ever
I watched the Irish farmer clip on Kevin's channel
Haha needs to do one with Boondocks saints 1 or 2
Me being a Brazillian seeing jack speaking english while translates ireland accent:    *what?*
I had an Irish teacher and she some of what she said was like her but others weren’t
Ayeee im from good ol' stab city 👀
I want to move to Ireland because of how pretty it is 🇮🇪 EVEN THO IM MEXICAN 🇲🇽
My was your accent💜
If I'm ever going to visit Irland I'm not worried that they don't understand me, I'm worried that I don't understand them. But I like hearing it (beside the most southern one. That one is just mumbling to me)
Alright, this is gonna sound corny as hell... ...but I think Jack had the best accent.
Sean never said what type he was hmmmmmmm
p
I absolutely love the try channel, the people from the facts channel started it and it’s all about Irish people trying things like food and alcohol. It’s so funny and really addictive
My was yours
Fun little short story: My boyfriend and I were leaving Magic Kingdom at Disney World at closing time for the park after the fireworks. There was a LOT of people all leaving at once and out of nowhere I started having a pretty bad panic attack. I hid my face in my boyfriend’s chest as we started making our way towards the monorail and while his presence helped me calm down a lot, what really helped distract me and comfort me was actually a group of Irish tourists with really strong accents talking quite loudly in front of us that I was able to just enjoy listening to. :)
Watch siege of jadotville
Ireland vlogs when?
I know this isn't heavily related but my father is from the south in the US and his accent is really thick. We're black and my girl isn't so when she hears us talking with him and understanding him, her head flips every time.  It's hilarious.
“It’s all in good crack...” continues to snort cocaine
The bradd pitt irish accent was a gypsy accent which jason stathem says earlier in the film, somin along the lines of "it aint irish, it aint english. Its just gypsy" film is a materpiece
Um Sean... Limerick is one county above where you said it was... I think, I dont know I’m from Dublin.
17:49 Yeah, just omit the 'm' to make 'woan', it's easier. That's what we (English) do to 't's.
Mirror sounds like that in a Detroit accent too LOL
As I'm sure loads of people are from Ireland here as am I. But damn most of those were horrible and some were really relatable. I don't hear my own accent really but hey maybe there is one.
You either love or hate an irish accent. And if you hate it your wrong xD thats a vibe haha
Its the same with people who think they can do a 'South African' accent but we have soooo many different accents and when tourists try a 'South African' accent it sounds like *none* of our accents😂
8:50 these are the young offenders now... Feel old yet?
Sean doesn’t even sound that Irish
8:11 he looks like the G-man from half life
Love the fact that Ireland is so small yet it has a fucking million different accents
I live near Skibbereen those guys are like local heroes, also pretty much everyone sounds like that, in fact they speak pretty clearly for someone from West Cork
HAHAHAHA Hot Fuzz is one of the funniest films i have watched.
More we need more videos like this! please! MORE
The travel ban is strictly to keep Sean from going back to Ireland
I’m not Irish but I am half Scottish and I can do a decent Scottish impression
Wait no don’t stop
At the end, I'm pretty sure that was blind boy, no?
When I clicked this video, I had hoped Jack would see the clip of the coach in The Gentleman, but this is great too
“im great at this”  *says the irish guy*
People impersonating Irish accents is like the people who say “I can do a Southern accent,” and proceed to just put yeehaw after every sentence and think we all sound like that. Each state has its own accent and even different variations between each part of the state too.
How does anyone understand anyone else in Ireland? I felt like I was having a stroke.
Irish people: *exists* Lil pump: that's my inspiration
1:13 this girl actually looks like jack
The farmer is not that hard to understand. I dont see what the problem is
Walken IS irish
Well we can clearly see who coached the cast of Wild Mountain Thyme in their Irish accent....
The thicker the accent gets, I'm just like ?????? relying on Jack to translate.
0:43 why do i hear a video game punch?
I thought the farmer was speaking Geilic
The accents are confusing me because they sound pretty different than my family in Ireland.
I'm still in the middle of learning Irish from Sean (rdr2)
theres a fine line between strong accents and not being able to fkin speak
I feel like really severe Irish accents sound like they're just talking with a mouth full of cheetos
even im from ireland (Dublin) and i havent a clue what that famers saying
Its pronounced erb...herb is someones name GET ENGLISH
He should have put subtitles on to see what it would say.
Jack does a better Cristopher Walken being Irish, than Cristopher Walken does being Cristopher Walken being Irish.  Edit: idgaf how his name is spelled.
“FUCK YOU ITALY!!”  Me crying in a corner: “the dance of Italy whowowoh...” sniffle sniffle
Dude it's the same here in Scotland. Speaking to a working class Scotsman who has a thick accent and uses words you've never heard of is hopeless.
Now i want to learn Irish  Jack where are your from exactly in ireland
Irish Farmer fellow sounds like he's Norwegian trying to speak english.
My favorite accent was the Irish one
Ngl I could listen to the sheep farmer all day without understanding a word he says and be content
IS THAT COBH I SEE IN THE BACKGROUND 15:53 LETS GO BAAIIIIIS
When Americans think of an Irish Accent, we're thinking of Northside Dublin. I will say several years ago I was traveling home from a conference in London, and I had an 11 hour layover in Dublin, and me and many other people just waited in the Airport Lounge for it to open back up, and there was an Indian man working the bar, and I could not for the life of me understand a word he said as he had a super thick combination Irish-Indian accent.  After watching this though... It might have just been full blow Irish.  Because I also remember this red headed woman walk into the airport with 7 red headed kids, and I remember thinking "That's clearly a good catholic lady" but I couldn't understand a single word she was screaming at her kids.  I knew she was screaming in English... but I just couldn't make it out as she berated each kid, and then her youngest was rolling on the floor and she went all in dragging him up and was shouting more unintelligible words. That layover was practically a weird Irish fever dream.
Isn't Scottish the same as Irish?? XD
Its really fuckin easy for people that live in the Southern USA to do an irish accent
Love this
There's no such thing as an Irish accent, it differs wildly depending on the county
At 2:21 he sounds a bit like Gru from Minions
me being irish amd still not understanding
Irish peps go ding ding in the replies
how the fuck do i understand all of this
We’re is corpse on the list
I'm Scottish at least I'm top 3 but Italy? Bruh how, theyre accent sounds like a sweaty obese man who's been smoking since he came out the womb 79 years ago
wait frikin jamie dorman is in here oh god not again
2:20 Jack goes full Arnold Schwarzenegger
17:27 All of this group sounds British or American with a hint of Irish to me.
Me: sees the video title Also me: immediately think about ethan
I'm from county Antrim and there is like 15 diff accents round me lol
Yo jack you should react to drum covers
Ths is precious. :)  EDIT: The ancient farmer's accent is the one for me. Yes sirree!
Seán: get f**ked Italy! *Angry spaghetti Marzia noises*
RT News...      COINCEDENCE I THINK NOT
So I basically built a grenade...   It’s true I did by putting coke and mentoes in a water bottle then shaking it up then it got really pressurized and I didn’t want to throw it cause I’m inside but woop di do its already snowing outside so ima throw it out there.
45 sheep less for the welsh
Im irish, and i cant understand that sean mac guy 😂
Lol I got an ad about a disaster relief hotline while watching brad Pitt
Kerry accent is my favourite I’ve got meself a Dublin accent T.T
That sheep farmers accent is so heavy it’s it own language
I'm Irish longford this is amazing
The funny thing about how Irish people sound when they speak English - our accents come from how we would have sounded when speaking in Irish, (with regional dialects and stuff) if the majority of us still spoke Irish. For example, the “shh” sound in the Kerry accent is still there when a Kerry person speaks in Irish and the broad, almost nasal sounds of the northern accent (frostbite guy) are still there in the northern Irish accent too. And then the accents just loose the plot all together when you meet actual native Irish speakers, for whom Irish is their first language. It’s gas altogether.
The lady is teaching you a kind of Northern Irish acsent
I couldn’t understand all of what the farmer said, some words, and the school guy couldn’t really understand almost at all, but everyone else was perfectly fine
Brad Pitts character Mikey is an irish gypsy, i honestly cant believe you havent seen Snatch lol.
aka Jack being a little homesick for 20 minutes : ( Sorry you can't go home yet, bud
Im irish jack
This needs to be a series o-o "Frostbutt" can't tell if he meant to say that, or it just sounded like that... xP either fits..
I have no idea why but an unintelligible Irish accent is the funniest accent in the world
No one is gonna see this but I’m gonna say this how I heard it 19:23   Everything down in cark is great, you know when your kicking and flying and shaving and then shave a bull out of your mouth    I feel like I’m gonna get so many dislikes on this comment
Me and my mum's side of the family are all from rural Galway (literally in the backend of NOWHERE, sheep everywhere, barely any shops, fields all around, everyone has a collie, nobody had internet until like last year). My grandad had the STRONGEST ACCENT IMAGINABLE because he was like... A proper old Irish farmer (like owned a lot of land and livestock, owned prized horses that were trained for professional horseracing, owned an old castle at one point, drowned kittens and puppies because they had no access to vets). For my whole life, I don't think I understood a single word he said, and I always had to get my mum to translate anything he said to me even though he was SPEAKING ENGLISH. It was absolutely wild.  Fun fact also: my grandad survived carbon monoxide poisoning, getting hit by vehicles like 6 times, 4 house fires, 2 heart attacks, being kicked by horses countless times, electrocution, various other near death experiences, and was also HELD AT GUNPOINT in a bar he owned and walked up and fuckin TOOK THE GUN OFF THE GUY saving like a HUNDRED people in the bar. He was an amazing man)
I might not be purely Irish but at 10:36 is when my soul started to hurt
You should vlog travilin ireland
It would be awesome if u go to Ireland and make a videoblog of ur homeland
scottish accent? never heard a scottish accent, ive been to scotland and everyone just had a british accent
All i got out of that was sure it would be bright out
how can jack even translate this..
I would love for Jack to go travelling around Ireland and go exploring it would be a bloody great vlog, like if you agree :)
Is it me or does the irish schoolboy look oddly like Gman
Dude, I'm still so amazed on how jack was able to translate the Irish famrer. All I understood was 45 sheep. I have low IQ, my human mind is too weak
15:07 that Louth accent is absolutely shocking. I mean form that guy not the actual accent because I am from Dundalk
You should've listened to ANOTHER IRISH DRINKING SONG
Random thoughts: - Christopher Walken always sounds like Christopher Walken, no matter what role he plays. It’s one of the things I love about him. - I understood most of what the first farmer said, but thought the second was talking about jogging, not having a good dog.  - No difficulty understanding the “frostbit” kid or the silver medal winners, but if you’d asked me to guess, I’d have said the kid was Scottish. - I need to find that last video. My great-grandmother on my mother’s side was from County Clare. I want to know what she sounded like. - Sean’s accent has faded over the years, but returns with a vengeance when he collabs with other Irish Youtubers. I wish he did that more often. - I wonder which non-Irish actors Sean thinks did a really convincing Irish accent? I think Joe Gilgun did a great job in Preacher.
You should react to the guy at the end that said "it may be english"
Sean mc glock em
This is completely off topic but I saw "Top of morning" in Harry potter goblet of fire in the quidditch world cup scene if you look close enough thought to let Sean know about this
My family is from Galway. Sadly I was born here in Missouri so i only slightly have an Irish accent.
I shouldn't be laughing, but i'm laughing.
"Eat shit France" needs to become a meme
Bruh I don’t understand how I understood most of that when I can Barely understand my moms southern Tennessean accent.🤦‍♂️
But I am not tired
When Irish is too Irish
The thing about Wild Mountain Thyme as well is Jamie Dornan is from Ireland, the North but STILL you'd think he could do a kerry accent (i think that's where its based idk)
I'm subscribed! I love you Sèan!! Im also Irish but I was born in United States!
My country(Netherlands also including Flanders for this) has 5 official subgroups of dialects in the Dutch language that can also all be divided by around 4/6 depending which province or region you mean. In total we have around 25-ish different dialects in the whole region. So yeah, welcome to Europe.
13:05 I think that happens because your accent has felt insulted. x)
I love this video, haven't laughed so long 😂
E
You should do a virtual tour of Ireland. Not your previous home or anything super personal but some cools spots
The fec im Irish that Irish voice frickin video sound notin lik it
I cannot get over the fact that Seán was actually able to translate that farmers accent 🤣
You didn't even watch sham's rté interview
I m colecti g mony for my fathers home can you plz help me
Flowweurrrrrr
I dont think hes wrong about Irish accent being the most sexist
I live on the Cork/Kerry border so I have the pleasure of being able to switch between both accents when I like ehe
My dad is Irish. Born and raised, lived there for 22 years and he doesn’t have an accent
It’s always funny. My family is Irish but I’m from the US so I don’t directly have the accent but somethings pop out every now and again and I’m able to understand the accent better than a lot of my friends.
The Irish accent is just less aggressive scottish
jack did you used to play hurling or gaelic football  when you where younger
HA SEAN MCGLOCKLOIN MORE LIKE SEÁN MACORONI is the meme still a thing or nah?
Those accents aren't too heavy. The farmer one going on about the missing sheep was now but the others were nothing.
4:02 - "Brad Pitt, you're lucky you're gorgeous." Truer words...
I think the Cork accent might be the “quintessential” accent, the one that most considered “Irish.”
I'm currently trying to do british and Scottish accents. I am American so it's hard lol. I'm not even going to attempt the others until I get those two.
I am actually crying this was so funny :) Loved it, do more!!!!!!!!
I was trying to eat while watching the brad pitt part AND I LITERALLY CHOKED AND SPIT OUT WHAT I WAS EATING My throat hurts now
I pride myself on being able to understand strong accents, but goddamn that sheep guy is impossible. he says a bunch of gibberish and then "FARTY FIVE SHEEP"
can i be injected with some irish accent....?
I think there's something beautiful about how Irish those accents are
My favourite examples of irish stereotypes all being thrown together is those random episodes in Star Trek. There's at least one episode for every version of the franchise, I swear
i'm Irish and couldn't tell you what the sheep farmer was saying half the time
so I'm Irish, Scottish, German, and Native American, does that make me a heathen of all languages? or am I perfect as is?  and my grandma was born in France!
Jacks accent has went from Irish Irish to American Irish
2:22 He sounds part Felix and part Arnold
i visited ireland two years ago and we stayed in dingle (country kerry) and this man wemet had the thickest accent ive ever heard lol
Can you please make more fortnite videos pls
Watching this while drinking Jacks's peppermint Hot Chocolate
Im just like, If my aunt can barley understand a thick British accent; she be stumped with this
The US is just as bad. I’m in the Midwest. Yes we say “Ope” Lol
here is a tip for among us on skeld asteroids is a visible task the guns move on the outside so now you now if they fake the task
Me, a Brazilian guy who have been watching this channel for so many years and have spent 2 years of his life in Dublin, living with Irish people: well, I can understand 98% of what these people say. Lord, I’m a genius!  Also me watching this video at 5:06 : Am I dumb? Cause I couldn’t understand shit. It sounds like German to me. The only thing I could understand was “sheep”. 😂  And Jack... your accent is hot/sexy af. Just saying. I’m actually learning how to have your accent and your videos are helping me a lot.
The word mirror: Irish - Mirr Texan- Meer  Woohooo both deletin extra syllables
I imagine the third clip is what my great great grandparent would sounded like because somewhere up there one on them was from Ireland because I'm half Irish
Me: >_<      Ad: PENNY STOCK PICKS, PENNYSTOCK PICKSS....
Honestly that dude's accent wouldn't be as ridiculously hard to understand if I knew Irish slang. I could follow some parts of what he was saying and once he slowed down a bit it made a lot of sense but some of that fast bit was a very Irish manner of....phrasing? I guess? so I couldn't piece together what he was trying to say.
Imma be disappointed if am Irish lad can’t finish this “ONE GEARDAI”
Jack, are you getting GRAY HAIRS??   I also love Irish accents. I've been practicing mine.
Call me kevin reacted to the irish dude with the heavy accent and he tried to translate but he couldn't understand half of it, I was impressed that jack could get all of it.
12:52 Then again, this was the same Buzzfeed idiot who thought to drink squash undiluted.
I liked because I liked.
Jack should do a video about celebrity look alikes, because when I first saw Jacksepticeye, I immediately thought of Murr from Impractical Jokers, I have no idea why.
Wait but in your older videos you said top a ta morning.
This video just kinda confirmed that I like the collabs even more. Hope everyone had fun.
how DARE you miss the northern irish accent in the last video
That farmer is like my uncle, next thing he's telling you how to hot wire a tractor
we had a teacher who was Irish. He had to say the word mirror and it just sounds like murr. Some poor guy just kept writing murr in his essay cause he just couldn't decipher his thick accent
Ah fuck I can actually understand the old lad which is said. The kerry accent will be the death of me
Idk if you have heard of this show but it’s called hell on wheels and they casted real Irish people and it was amazing you should check it out, I think it’s still on netflix
Jack I love how much fun you're having in this video. It's fun to listen to and accents in general are such a topic.  Also realizing you sound like me (or I sound like you?) when I went and found "Over the Moon" on Netflix and just fanning over the authenticity and familiarity of it.
Do a full reaction video to wild mountain thyme movie plleeeeaaaasse
I fuckin love this
Jack! I love you and nogla for the accents and content. Both make me smile always. My grandma was a 1st generation immigrant to US from Ireland and she had a heavy accent. Reminds me of her when I hear ya and love it
Jacksepticeye's Funniest Home Videos?!?! Is that you????????
Scottish is the meanest accent 😂
I want more of this tbh
good god i went to school w the frostbit boy
I think the Cork accent is the one that most people associate with Ireland.
WTF what is this !!!
Sad we didn't get to see the drunk Irishman video on youtube where his calling out Davey and his son John lol
Sean could've translated that guy as saying anything and I'd believe him, I just heard sheep lmao
Wild mountain time ding ding ding top of morning
Sláinte!
0:23 Mario Mario, And Luigi Mario wants to know your location
Is there just an Irish accent or is there a full blown Irish Language...    - I feel every Irish speaking person sounds like complete gibberish...  The more exposure you can get to anything, the more you might be able to understand it better... (In this case, the Irish accent...)  I like the girl from North Dublin...
When your Irish and this video just makes you slowly die Inside
I hate my accent lmao it's just like the "frostbit" one. Luckily it's not as strong.
“There’s a lot of examples of people trying to do Irish accents that don’t have an Irish accent, and it just sounds absolutely dreadful”  *Unus Annus flashbacks*
Is he speaking Chinese because it sounds like it to me btw this is not meant to be offensive this just what it sounds like to me so yea
Thick Irish is like a new laungage.
hes got gray hair...
Seans face at 3:48 😂
OILE
Having an Irish soccer coach for three years has prepared me for this moment
I heard you on the radio
1:45 I LOVE NATUREEEE
Last year, the lift in my school got stuck half way down and the caretaker was on the phone to the lift man talking in a REALLY strong west clare accent at the speed of light, you could not understand a single word he was saying. I feel sorry for the lad on the other end of the phone, I mean gees! Im sure some of you have had the same experience.
Come out ye black and tans
RIP Americans who can’t understand the farmer… I can just *barely* understand him...
The way she said "Ireland" makes it sound like "oiland"  Just don't let America hear you say that.
You are very very clear to understand. The video with the sheep, I couldn't understand anything. Im a french Canadian.
6:10 *Jack translates the Irish mumblings*  Me: .....How the hell? I’m not trying to be disrespectful, but what exactly is he picking up on to be able to translate? Irish or not, I’d have a hard time translating anyone speaking that softly.
*Deedle dee-dee deedle dee-dee*
I love how nobody knows "Top of the Morning" is just a Jack thing
If you do another accent video, can you react to the language Afrikaans. Think you would like to hear it
Jack should’ve called upon EEF to judge these accents
I don't really think irish accents are all that difficult to understand (I'm Portuguese) but Cork... bro.. when I was in Dublin I met a few people from Cork and I always needed a few seconds to process what they said because w h a t
REPRESENT MY BOY
Sexiest accents haha wonder if mine is up there... Just kidding there’s absolutely zero chance, ppl hate my countries accent. *pitifully laughs in german*
"oh my G(WHEEEEZE)OD!"
This is why Americans forget most Irish people speak English
Live in Ireland. Can confirm
I'm from Galway originally and moved to the North when I was younger. I was bullied in school for my accent because if the way I said Flower (like Flouy-ur) compared to the way their northern Irish accents said it like 'flar' :' ) Now I have a DIRTY STINKY northern Irish accent because I was bullied into it : (( RIP my amazing Galway accent (objectively the nicest sounding one)
who else wants jack to play spiderman ps4 remastered >
This should be called Irishman watching Irish Stuff
Why was Australia no.5??
Why does jack look like he’s in toad sage mode this video
Being Irish makes this so much better. Ya always have that one family member with the real THICC irish accent ye just cant understand a fucking bit
Is it weird that I actually understood that farmer 😂
I can understand the sheep dude and it makes me so happy  I'm not even Really Irish I've just got Irish ancestry and am attempting to reconnect to it by being angry at the government and listening to Black 47
My Irish boyfriend sent me this video and I'm dying
The Irish accent is like a language of its own
I imagine Ireland to look like Essex, except 70% of it is replaced with fields of sheep.
Jack: eat s**t France   Me: (has a French accent) wait what u says bish
Can you replay far cry 3 dude
U did pewds thing when mentioning the subs lol.   Pewds: LWO IAY TRANSLATION No way
Jack @19:54 the lad with the Spar bag is 1 of the Rubber Bandits. Look for a song called Horse Outside
Holy sh*t 6:10 Jacks translation is impressive
You should do more of these
0:41 seconds in and he's already aggressively insulting us :>
You say you have no idea what it was, yeah, more of that please, love it when you delve into languages and accents and different places!
Jack can you do more Irish accent videos
What is that saying “an edge is an edge I don’t know why the reapers moanin”
I'm from Quebec (the french part of Canada) and I swear to god, I felt this video. We're pretty much the equivalent of the Irish accent but for French. Any french speaker from outside the province could try it's best and attempt to speak with our accent but nobody can get it quite right. Pair that with the fact that almost every region has their slight differences and you get some outsiders very confused. I can't imagine coming from another country without being kinda weirded out by our accent at first.
i remember seeing some of this on Kevin's channel and laughing so hard! nice to laugh again
Jack you should play the new Legend of Zelda Hyrule warriors game. It is soooo fun
You should react to and watch a video which goes through the different accents in Wales and see if you find any difference😂there is, but not everyone can hear it.
PLESE DO SWEDISH ACCENTS
I tink oi lovt evry occent. Sorri for me badt Oirish lads.
Sad he didnt recognise the rubber bandits......
Such a beautiful country and the people are just lovely!! My week there was way to short. I hope to make it back there someday. Listening to jack makes me nostalgic.
11:13 had me rolling.  "Yeah, I'm a vowel bender."
You haven't seen the Artemis Fowl movie, have you? The accents in it are...
Love your videos man keep up the good work and making the greatest videos ever and yh man Irish accent is good man
I must confess, I didn't understand anything until the two Olympians. After that I understood everything. I'm from germany and can't even speak english very well. XD
7:43 Nah, you're clear. I'm English (in Essex).
i'm actually quite impressed with Jack's christopher walken accent :D
Y’all Americans think that French accents are so fuxking romantic until you spend all day surrounded by actual like VIOLENTLY FRENCH accents in English and bro I’ll tell you-
No, you sound understandable most of the time...but with the Irish lads...oh THAS ALSKAJLALZOLAKAL SUREJSLLAJ
Yritäpä ymmärtää Tampereen murretta.

I thought I was just rewatching the Call Me Kevin video about the Irish news for the Twentieth time.
I'm from cork and I could understand it but goddamn the fuckin Kerry accent

Whale Oil Beef Hooked
I really liked hot fuzz, it was well thought out. I had to watch it twice to get the story right. (U can watch it on Netflix)
Anyone else from Limerick??
Drink proper 12 whiskey
Immediately sharing with the family xD
"Irish people, you're great don't change for anybody" says it with americanized accent lol, It's better and funnier when his accent gets thicker during the video
Irish Brad Pitt sounds like Sean in RDR2
i actually loved this video!
Only Irish people can like this
THIS ISNT EVEN AN ACCENT ITS JUST A DIFFERENT LANGUAGE WTF
I am Irish and undstood it perfectly I am from clare also for people who are not irish people if you want to know how are you its pog mo thoin
Irish isn't the bigfoot of accents, but Christopher Walkin's attempt was the bigfoot of the Irish accent. Every once in a while you'd hear a word or two and then it's gone again.
I dont know if its because i come from an irish decent but i could understand that farmer perfectly fine...
They didn't cast Irish people for these because only Irish people would understand it
7:31 so that's where RT games gets his name from
so are they talking in english? I dont understand much at all
I remember when you first watched the rowers from Cork video :') good times
FANTASTIC
imma be disapointed if an irish lad cant finish this  "ONE GEARDAI
why do i feel like if you asked one of jack's subs for one of his personality traits, somebody would answer with 'irish'
I’m Irish but not the authentic Irish type I only have ancestors that were Irish and some alive I’m pretty sure that our Irish I still haven’t met yet cousins or something like that and as much as I’d love to be all knowing of the culture of my ancestors I’m not and I’m never going to act like I am some full-blooded Irish lass because I am an American girl with a bunch of different things other than Irish some British and I mean a little bit like 2% and I’m 2% Scottish I think the British part is whales in the Scottish part I’m not sure but I’m also Norwegian Swedish Polish Indian Cherokee but not that much either of Indian still don’t know the percentages exactly but I know at least two of them of the percentage I mean also German still don’t know how much I am on that side either but anyway after this whole pandemic is done I’d like to know more about where I come from or more over about my ancestors where they came from anyway thanks for the video Sean sorry to say I can’t put The accent over the A but at least I didn’t try to spell your last name wrong anyway top of the evening to ya( I mean have a nice day😊)🤗
So, after watching this, I have an important question. How good is Atlas' Irish accent in the first Bioshock? You know, considering the plot twist and everything.
Avater the last voul bender
The Irish rowers Graham Norton interview is absolutely brilliant
Just sounds like Brad Pitt is stringing together words that relate to caravan and ma 🤣🤣
YES Italy accent is the second sexiest accent (I’m Italian btw)
I love this friken video 😂😂😂😂
what the fUHCK, JEFF?
My prayers have been heard, another video about Irish accents!!
It's so weird when ppl generalize a whole country's accent. I'm from the US and have lived in the same city my whole entire life, and I have ppl asking me strangely often where I'm from or if I'm adopted 😂
That was fun! you should go down some more holes.
Loved this video. Very fun & very funny. I moved away from my native land too & I often miss speaking with ppl who know what I'm talking about lol. I hope when you can travel again, you can take your beautiful Dutch queen to your birthplace & travel around & get back to your roots, even if just for a while. 💚💚💚
Oh come on, now. Christopher Walken could pass for an Irish farmer in that movie...... he's at least as believable as Sean Connory was when playing a Russian submarine commander in Red October. XD
The sexist accent is a Indian accent
12:34 IDK Why this is funny😂😂
The scenery is gone by 4 o clock jack your not missing much
get FOOK italy
Jackoboy is backoboy
2:21 He sounded like gru from despicable me 😂😂
I love that while watching Wild Mountain Thyme trailer I could not stop hearing my uncle and cousins from Ireland complaining about it lol
"FrostButt" 8:15
Please do more I found this very amazing
@13:05 no jackaboy it’ll be the Afrikaans accent for sexiest in the world thank you very much
WATCH OUT FOR WALKEN
I didn't understand half of this video
I just yelled mirror like MIRRRR and I just got an “are you ok” look
L A U G H
When your Irish,Dutch and German and you live in the USA it sucks ass
Was that Jaime Dornan in the first Irish movie trailer?  Edit: was that young Shaw in the second clip with Brad Pitt?
I Love how only US Irish would be the only ones to understand those accents
haha jokes on you guys im irish, scottish, and english
I could understand the 2 guys who were Olympic winers or whag ever
7:25 this basically summarizes the majority of Ireland. People don’t care about the rest of the world they care about this lads sheep
Afrikaans is better than Irish!!
You should have done an inner Tallagh accent😂
😂this is blursed
Farty five
Australian is 5th?!   thought it would be at the bottom end.
I'm kinda sad he didn't review Norman Reedus' Irish accent in the Boondock Saints movies tbh!
It's my birthday jack and this video is the best present you could of given to me. Love to Ireland and their gibberish
minx is definitely from cork
Me: Irish and can understand the farmer.                     Me: I AM IRISH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
That last cork ascent broke me 🤣 I'm from cork and that was spot on
Reminder to everyone that UK government is still surprising native Irish speakers in their own country
Hey New Zealand has the sexiest accent in the world
I'm dying of laughter,
Irish accents to me aren't really attractive. It just makes me want to attack England. It's a automatic testosterone boost to reclaim the land
My Gaelic (my grandma would be turning in her grave if she knew i misspelled Gaelic) is not that great
Mirror: M - I - and fifteen R's had me laughing.
I think that my country (malaysia ) is similar to Ireland because we have one language but many different accents. And if you're malaysian, where you from.
I'm a quarter Irish because my nan was originally from Ireland and my mom had to translate what she was saying because her accent was so strong when she first moved to England.
I think we figured out what Irish noises are
jack: lets invade Ireland  also jack: irish people im sorry pls let me back into the country
Was SOOO hoping for a look at some Blindboy Boatclub interviews!
Irish accent: voted as sexiest accent Me: laughs in lucifer
one of my teachers is irish and i love his voice so much
I honestly listen to you so much that I forget your Irish until you say things like garage.....
Let's ask the other Irish lads to do this video!!!!
Hey I hate waking up in the morning and looking myself in the *mirrrrrrrrrrr*
I'm Irish and I couldn't even understand that poor farmer!!! Come back to us Sean!
Did Sean just get a Terminator accent?
Why do I get wholesome tingling feelings when listening to an Irish accent?  *H E L P*
Since Southern dialects originated mostly from a mix of immigrants from the British Isles, I was surprisingly able to understand 75% of these examples. I have a thick southern accent since I was born in Mobile, AL. A lot of people don’t know that their related!
Glad to know, that you irish people do the same as we swiss people. Everyone makes fun of the other accents.
6:14 THATS ALL HE WAS SAYING?? 😂
I'm half Irish lmao
The Frostbit Boy became a bit of a celebrity in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland for that news report. I remember seeing him at a bar in Belfast and my friends were starstruck
5:37 i thought that was a unknown language i could understand a single word  Edit: the translation is insane jack
The U.S. version of that sheep farmer's accent is Deep Bayou Cajun patois.
6:17 jeez they still speak Celtic
God. I remember Jacks overgrowth video was the first video i watched. He didn’t even have a million back then. What a ride.
I can barley understand Jack when he speaks and I love it
I want to move to Ireland now 🇮🇪
Having an Irish accent looks extremely tiring
Me who's going out of country for the first time to go to Ireland in march
I heared mountains, sheep, and 45.
The pronunciation of that name is Shawn Mac an tee es I thigh
Jack has the best accent
The lost sheep Irish guy sounds like he’s speaking Japanese/chinese.
Kerry to be fair has the best accent
Seán
I do not speak potato but i wish i could
which was the greatest? Well that'll be yers of course ;)  Okay that felt wrong I'm sorry LYNH
Crazy how long I watched jack ever since he lived in his cabin it’s been a long journey
Bro, over 50 percent are subscribed? That is really good.
You’ll never know what ts said
Hey oh buddy it’s been a long time I remember the first video you did also the first time you had a 1000 subscribers that was amazing and now look at you you’ve gone so far almost makes me feel like that you were the greatest YouTuber in my childhood
That farmer sounds a bit like my grandmother not gonna lie ... to be fair shes north Kerry but here I am with my south Kerry accent sounding nothing like a farmer .. oh wellllll
Lmao
The strangest thing is that I an American, can understand quite a bit of these
Why I mostly understand everything I'm not Irish at all but still
Irish people feel very special rn
Jack: "That's how you read his name, Sean Mac An Tsithigh" Me: "you're one to talk Sean McLooLoo"
I didn't understand anything that farmer said... jesus WHAT?!!  The schoolboy wasn't so bad at least!
That farmers my neighbour
'eye dunt cear'
The girl they used for the Kerry accent is a wolf in sheep's clothing that's why there is 45 sheep missing
Also watch Young Offenders... you'll thank me later :3
Sean doesn’t know the rubber bandits? Shameful irishman
Also, Sean you REALLY have to get some sleep
Why do the sheep have trans flags on them 🏳️‍⚧️
That Richie fella knows what the craic is about... get yaself Loyal Dag
“Get f-ed Italy” Me who likes Italy:.... ow, that hurts lol
This gives similar vibes to what happens in NewZealand when a tourist tries to speak Maori. They mispronounce the simplest of things, everytime.
Actually somehow I'm pretty sure the kiwi (New Zealand) accent got the sexiest
Jack tries to translates his baby's mumbles. 6:04
Jack Why'd u not include the northern Irish one at the end 😔
I'm so shocked I could actually understand them
Call Me Kevin couldn't translate the sheep farmer, yet he talks about being more Irish than Sean, lol.
All I understood was 'sheep'
Watching this video just reinforces me wanting to learn how to do a proper Irish accent and get proper control over my accents in general, I have a problem that causes me to shift into/out of accents pretty much at random and I have a hard time maintaining one accent even my own.
Although irish was 1st in 2019 the best accent in 2020 is now kiwi. But irish is in 3rd sadly
Frostbite boy is from NorthernIreland
Awe he’s homesick
Sean go back to ireland and revisits childhood memories???
I’m sorry but this looks like a terrible movie  ******* the first one *******
I feel the same with people trying to do a southern American accent "THEY ARE NOT ALL THE SAME"
I feel like it all of a sudden turns into a new language/ dialect.
He should've reacted to the snl pilot skit where Kate (i think that's her name) and james McAvoy speak in a Irish accent
I know of a good (from what I thought) Irish accent from the game Red Dead Redemption 2. I think his name was John but the voice actor did real well
My accent was the best accent
When u are watching other people with Irish accents your accent gets stroger
What is the guy saying???
Kinda Sus
jack, can i get a heart on this comment so i feel special
I actually thought they were speaking another language at first
hahaha great video!
The 'frostbit' video went fucking VIRAL for ages and was filmed near where I lived. They made MERCH of it and I couldn't fuckin get away from it for like A YEAR. No Ody in school would shut up about it and the guy was interviewed on the news after it went viral and everything. Oh my god the memories I do not want to have
As an Irish lad, I have no fuckin clue wat there on bout
I absolutely love these types of videos please keep on making more😊👍🏻
I like the part when they said”ahehehje alga huji ai shen shiep of margantt am ti ssjssdjfb”
.I too say "mirrror" as mi with 15 r's after it.
Yer woman there definitely wasn’t Irish bai 😂
U should do these type of irish videos once in a while....its so cool😂😂
Ever try doing an Irish accent and you end up sounding Russian, but you roll your Rs and nobody can understand you because you also sound like you have a lisp?     Oh...
I work at a summer camp in Missouri and we get a lot of brits and aussies sho are counselors. The kids love them and after 8 weeks you can see their accent become more americanized. They also love to here us homegrown midwesterners and the Texan talk.
As soon as i saw that opening, i knew this was gonna be a good video
Brad Pitt’s was meant to be unintelligible
no one:  my brain: hey, hey psst.... MIRRR
i didn't understand the half of the video KXLSJSLJSIDKAFHOAJS
I just got Cuphead the other day and now i gotta fight the freaking Iron Giant. AAAAAAA
I had to comment back to say Damn You Sean. I looked up the sheep video and fell down a fucking rabbit hole.
Honestly I like Seamus Finnegan’s accent from Harry Potter. He was my favourite character in those movies. Always blowing stuff up 😋. I’ve actually had an experience with Scottish accents as a guy I dated in high school had relatives from there. OMG when they came for a visit and his grandparents were over as well (live in Canada but from Scotland) I was listening to one of their conversations and the only thing I understood from it was Niagara Falls. I honestly try to understand what people with accents say but when they either start drinking or just talking fast my mind can no longer comprehend lol.
Jack! Please react to horseoutside by the rubber bandits! You probably already know it but the irish childhood nostalgia would be iconic 🤣🤣🤣😍😍
Is this movie shrek the live action movie
Please do one of Northern Irish🤣
Man I can’t believe he didn’t look up the old guy in the pub with no teeth. He has a 10 fold stronger accent than the farmers.
I still remember the "hit the like button! LIKE A BOSS!!" at the end of his old videos
hi
Have you ever heard a Yorkshire fisherman’s accent? You cannot understand a single word
I love listening to Jack, (Sean, whatever his name is) talk, he's hilarious and every video he makes makes me very very happy.
News in the Czech Republic: "Woman gets stuck under a tree root, pees herself".
MORE MORE MORE!!!!!!
0:42 I am in bed, with a cup of milk next to me, I feel attacked
Talking about the Irish accent. What do you think of Derry girls?
jack being irish and being able to do an irish accent: wow im great at this :)
many people i have talked to say that my swedish accent sometimes sound a bit irish which is a bit funny when people say it cause to me does it sound completely swedish all the way...
I feel like the Irish , Scottish and Welsh when trying to understand a strong accent  in the uk tend to have a good amount of understanding. :’) like ' your accent is strong, but we get you'. And some English people of course, mainly the north(I’m looking at you my Newcastle cousins).
my drama lecturer is from county cork lol that part had me wheezing
12:28 I mean she did say A Irish accent, meaning she’s teachin ya one of em
The animated channel, was just animated RT

The only irish person i have heard say top of the morning is sean and my granny
18:20 “Ya’see, we don’t all sound like Leprechauns on acid” Killed me.
💚
Poor non Irish people trying to understand half of this video
The frost bit video went viral in the North when it first happened, can’t believe you’ve never seen it! Accents in the North just aren’t as nice as the South... and I’m from the North even we simp over those accents 😂
I thought nz is the sexiest
I wanna see a video where you put on your strongest irish accent
Child who said to look at his own channel : 👁️👄👁️
Imagine being bad at your own native dialect
This has made my day! They are all fantastic accents even if I can't always catch what they're saying if they speak their usual speed.
I want him to do a vid where he talks like he would around Irish friends use inv Irish slang that’d be funny
The Dublin one got to me. If I had a blindfold on and I heard it. I woulda fell in love
*Ah yehwouldntbelonggettin’ frost butt.*
I feel like in america jack is one of the only irish people everyone thinks of. Nogla doesnt count as irish and brian isnt as famous
We sound like the Olympic guys here
Herb spoken like (erb)
When i watch sean watching irish stuff and his accent gets stronger and mine does too and i dont even have much of an accent
Omg jacks going GREYYYYYYY
Pretty sure in Snatch he's supposed to be an Irish gypsie?
😄
i think Puerto Rico is the same fuckin way but in spanish
Alright that "how to do an Irish accent" video, she wasn't "wrong" but also very much wasn't "right"  Each vowel sound sounds slightly different depending on where you are in Ireland, so it's reeeeeally hard to fake the accent without actually having been there. (true for a lot of places in the world but idk where else has so much diversity) The point is if you learn one vowel sound wrong, maybe you make the "oi" sound too strong, it'll show every time you talk and it's really obvious. (Saying "oi" as in oil is a terrible way to describe how to say it, but I don't have a more accurate description that's short enough so I guess it's hard to blame anyone for it.)  I have a friend who moved to the USA, (I forget which state, somewhere on the west side) and he's been there for a while. Now he actually sounds like an American who's trying to sound Irish.
This video is golden
Can't believe he did my man blindboy like that
hey Jack i remembered a game . try doing it if you like it ( the name is straded deep)
5:42 i dont understand that man
Ara no, you didn't get around to the Donegal.
How the hell does someone steal 45 sheep over night
I felt that "COMEEE ONN." when you were watching that Emily Blunt movie trailer hahahahah why didn't they just hire Irish actors!?
NL
I’m great at this yeh cause your Irish
Mannn. Brad Pitt kinda sounds like Sean during his play through of minecraft. Lol
jesus is jack never gonna leave sage mode
I am  Irish and have family in Cork and even and I don't even understand
They should’ve let nogla narrate the movie instead    You want Irish? WELL YOU GOT IT
i am from NO and I we have strong accents like wash ya doin bye or was shalt or how's ya cuten
Earliest I've been😂
i live in castlerea so yea i hear thoses accents rarely
Sure, if we have to speak English, we may do it in a way that no one can confuse us with the English!
I can understand the Kerry farmer but only cuz I live on the Kerry, Limerick and Cork border and some of my cousins sound like the farmer so...😁
Could you possibly play the new story of subnautica below zero that you started you never finished the story?
In a seminar we watched the "how to do an Irish accent" and i just saw the girl and was sent back to that time and dying at the "floar floar" and just dying laughing. I'm glad Jack thoight it was funny too
Austrian accents/dialects really are something as well.  Although I feel like the differences aren't quite as crass as the ones here in this video. If you look at Switzerland, Germany, Austria and South-Tyrol* combined they might be able to keep up though... The Video “Germanistik: Warum sind deutsche Dialekte so unterschiedlich?” by “Universität des Saarlandes” illustrates the difference between different accents in the german language quite well right at the beginning. BTW: A lot of accents in Germany have similar Austrian accents and vice-versa  * South-Tyrol is an autonomous province in the very south of Italy — German with an accent fairly similar to the tyrolian one is relatively common there though since it once (before ~1919) belonged to Austria.
if you want a good example of the Kerry accent just look up videos of the healy-raes!
Now look at American Accents
I don’t understand a single word in this video.
I love this video so much, you did a similar one a few months ago xd
Jack, i'm not convinced you we're translating english some of those times. 8oI
I can only understand him because my mom is from Ireland
Christopher Walkin is taking revenge on every Irish person that made fun of the way he talks
I live In ireland and I didn’t see anything like this and I’ve been living here for about 20 years
my cat died 2 h ago  )=
I LOVE YOUR VIDEOS KEEP GOING

LIKE for me it sounds Irish but I'm not Irish but I guess it's the same when I hear fake Aussie accents I fucking die and can pick up on it really quick
Séan : Fuck You Italy!! Me whos Italian : 'v'
welp this is like the irish version of brave heart probs not a single irish person in it
The part were this farmer lost his sheep i understood shit i don't understand what in the world he was saying
Could you do more 60 seconds please, btw I love your videos.
If you think thats bad you should hear what vocal coaches teach actors for a texas accent or any southern for that matter
I love jack
The beginning of this video had me thinking about Saoirse Ronan and wondering what she's up to. The answer is she will be in The French Dispatch... next year? It is slated for 2021, but all sorts of movies are being pushed.
He’s spent to much time in Britain. He doesn’t even have an irish accent anymore
Just saying I’m Irish to and I love I’m ireland
Apparently I have a super power to understand heavy irish accents as an American.
I recognise the Limerick cartoon & the accent: It's the Rubberbandits!
My son wants your intro back
Jeez Sean I'm lactose intolerant so that drinking milk might not be the best idea.
you should bring your intro and outro back pwease I miss that
Hoome blooown ALIGATOR SEE YOU LATER
Oh my gosh please do more of these videos, I could listen to this shit all day
Ok but Marks and Ethan’s accents were immaculate
the hot fuzz quote, so good!!!! 😂
I love how this video is literally an Irish man translating in english what another Irish man said that is also in english
My granda was from kerry it's like second nature to me
When it got to the Brad Pitt part I really thought it sounded just a little like Nogla
Oh I wish he'd react to/review UK accents as well (especially Gordie) as he lives there now.
MORE VIDEOS LIKE THIS PLEASE BABY BOI
It could be worse jack, the could be trying to do a british accent. It's always a call for disaster when americans try to do british accents.
something aint right, I have no Irish blood in me and I'm from south east US and I can understand almost all of the words.
This video was hilarious. Love it!
At least I’m #2 for sexiest accents even if I don’t have one,
Kerry, mumble rappers can't compare to em'.
"People get the irish accent wrong" *Laughs in swedish*
Sean doesn’t sound like he has an irish accent to em he sounds like he has a British accent
mean while sean says "*HH*WHILE"
Totally feel like you cheated with the Irish sheep farmers, nobody can understand them except other sheep farmers!  I knew they’d be included and I love it! They’re as bad as hei’land fermers.
WTF youtube unsubscribed me and i missed all the alerts from about a week
I kinda feel like Sean taught the world how to pronounce Sean

Newfoundlanders accent is the best hands down. I feel like its a combination of irish/Scottish/nova Scotian accent all rolled into 1
How it’s supposed to be pronunced: Erb.   How Jack says it: HHHHHHHHHERB
indian accent
the Irish schoolboy sounds like someone out of still game hahaha.
Listen to David Boreanaz's from Angel, it's a real sh!t show.
Northside Dublin is the sexiest Irish accent, fight me
The Doolin County accent is one of my favorites. They don’t pronounce n most of the time, it’s an r. Ex: Panoramic, pronounced Paroramic
I can't take thick Irish and Scottish accents seriously... No Offense but how the hell did they make it in the top sexiest? Did an Irish man/woman make this list???
Mirrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
*Click on video...SILENCE* Me: ... *Realizes it's muted and unmutes*  "Start drinking more milk BITCH!"  Me: ...wtf?? xD
That is wrong, number 1st is Kiwi 2de South African and at 3de is Irish. Almost as sexy as me buddy.
if you enjoy doing things, i enjoy watching those things.
One of my favorite vacations was in Ireland! Cork to be specific! But I had trouble understanding the owners of the house we lived in for the time, even though I've done my IB on an international school and was one of the best in English class AND watched Jack for years already, since back around the time he got the Pewds shoutout :P
italian over scottish???? my accent sounds like gravel while scottish sounds so good, the fuck are they on about?
12:20 omg, there are more accents in Europe than in Ireland jack, so triggered...
Nobody can understand the irish except the irish ☘

I was in a play about Skibbereen
This video is too irish for me XD
Please tell me I'm not the only one who despises that man bun.
does Jack even have an Irish accent   sry
Ngl sexiest accent is the farmer. Lov it
He should try being an Irish version of Deadpool
STEALING KEVINS VIDEOS EVIL ARRGGGGGHHHHHHHH FUCK....
It's the same when they try do do Bavarian accents on German TV shows and films. It always sounds sooo awkward, like no real Bavarian would *ever* talk like that. I think it's because no one would actually understand proper Bavarian speech, but I honestly can't watch it without cringing all the way through. 😂
wait wait wait...if Irish people don't say "Top o' the mornin'", where the hell did it come from? like did ONE dude from Ireland meet someone not from Ireland and say that and the person speaking to them was like "Huh. I guess that's an Irish thing" and then spread it to where everyone thinks the Irish say that all the time? XD
.....  i understood the irish farmer better than you sean.  My uncle in law has a super heavy accent and then throws gaelic in sometimes. Now he is hard to understand until he starts cursing.
I can not understand anything but they seem like nice fellows
Wait hol up how do we have the sexiest accent we literally have like 200 different types of accents
Listening to that one farmer was like trying to understand a Newfie
The reason why Italian came is seconds was because of giorno giovanna
The second accent in the video titled  "guide to Irish accents" is RTgame's accent IMO
I'm South African and I fully understood everything these people said...   Am I okay?
i love it please do more
Accent Teacher: Yeah it’s oi  Seán: Tf did you just say?
why does the sheep guy sound like memier from god of war
Totally unrelated but I just ate 7 Popeyes biscuits with no drink.
I agree with jack,all the accents in ireland are super different despite the country being small.i was born and raised in dublin and the dublin accent sounds nothing like a typical irish accent it sounds like a liverpool accent but mixed with very low level culshie.i myself have a mid atlantic accent and everyone thinks im super american and are surprised when im just from dublin also in my secondary school everyone thought northerners had really really strong irish accents
cork sounds like the Minnesota of irland
Much love Jack
As an Irish person I am genuinely offended by that thing with Christopher Walken.
Do this more. I adore the Irish accent. Scottish accents are pretty nice too.
me an iranian not understanding a single word
Let's go whiskey challeng
Every linguist who watched this video had a lot of fun. I know I had a blast!
What about Bangla and Hindi accents of India?
I remember my first Jacksepticeye video, I was hooked on the accent and subscribed for the laughs and good vibes
I'm from northside Dublin meself and I couldn't for the life of me tell what that Kerry fella was sayin
Me a non-native english speaker trying to understand what the farmers said: that's it i'm giving up on this language
My ancestors are from ireland so i feel like i am part irish and im proud of that✌🏼🇨🇮
im used to alot of accents as my family is very scattered but i could BARELY understand the man with his sheep
I'm from Ireland in Clare if you don't know what a Clare accent is well ... you don't know do ya
WTF is this dude saying ''Irish farmer lost his sheep'' WTF AM I WATCHING
Sheep Farmer takes the Cake👌🏽👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾💖🔥💖💥
You aren't allowed back... I'm sorry... now the world just thinks we say top of the morning ...
I wonder what Irish singing is like...(Thinks about it)... Nope! never mind.
I dont know why, but the rowing team dudes accents sound like british mixed with Caribbean, and its the most confusing of the irish ones to me lol
Yo Irish music lowky a bop
This is one of the best videos I’ve seen in a long time.
The spud whisperer
I thought I was having a stroke while trying to figure out what the farmer was saying
I took an accent class in college ("Oral Expression through Theatre", I believe was the name of the class), and we did Standard British, American Southern, and Irish. Irish we did last because the professor was directing "Playboy of the Western World" the following semester and wanted a fresh crop of Irish accents.  We got tapes to listen to, but for the British and Irish accents, I just watched Britcoms. For Irish, I mimicked Ardal O'Hanlon. Got me an A.
that translation scene in hot fuzz is a damn classic i love it XD
I want to move to ireland for a few years and get that beautiful irish accent
Lol I needed this. Spent 6 months in Ireland and hearing people attempt to mimic the accent is like nails on a chalk board.
Jack has such contagious laughter, every time he laughs, I just crack up laughing 😆. LAUGH.
That sheep farmer sounded like he spoke a different language. That was NOT English i heard i stg Edit: also that schoolboy LMAO
Are we in Boston pahk and gahden
and 12:40 she sounds like shes trying to make a canadian accent
Okay but did the farmers get their sheep back?
I love most accents i think lol. Interesting to see the variations of irish accent 😂
This was really cool to watch! It's always neat to learn more about the country you came from!!
but what about Norman Reedus's irish accent in Boondock Saints? or was I imaging that one?
That  farmer almost sounded like a dutch person, trying to speak irish. 🤣🤣
I'm Italian so I'm 2 wow
saun says that every town in ireland has a different accent but i kid you not you've never heard albania literally one country that feels like it speaks different languages sometimes we can't even understand each other like  like every neighborhood has it's own accent (not really tho) but it feels like it
Now i know how Jack feels when he is trying to guess the language that his fans write
Irish people should have a language
I want Jack to do an American accent
0:05 okay Seán you don't need to call me out like that
Right crack this one to be sure 👍
they’ve used that news clip of the sheep herder on an LA radio show for YEARS & no one had any whiff of an idea what was being said and it’s insane to hear you actually translate it to real words and sentiments
As someone from Northern Ireland I find it so funny when I go down to Ireland and I can barely understand half of the people. This is why I make sure to classify to people that I’m “northern” Irish.
I’m from Kerry and didn’t understand half of what that fella was on about
Bro you're Christopher Walken impression was literally on spot
that farmer is 101% irish
My puppy is just fascinated by the Irish farmer and his sheep. Okay, really, she's just fascinated by all the Irish accents, good and bad haha
Na the  Sexiest accent is female British the London one
The Irish accent is so DAMN hard to understand good thing we have jack.....    oh wait he can barely understand either lol!
As an American, honestly most accents sound the same to me. Except the “country southern” accents. To me, Benedict Cumberbatch and Tom Holland have amazing American accents to me though I hear people complain about Benedict’s though to me it sounds normal 😂
There are 2 people in this world people who are Irish and people who want to be Irish
Is that Christian Grey?
Try understanding Scottish lol
FIRST OF ALL. I'm Scottish and French and feel offended but I love you so you get a pass.
Dear God, the longer the video went on, the more I started to understand 😮
I'm glad he translated because I had no idea what the fuck half of them were saying.
Would you be able to do more VR
im irish WHAT TF DID MANS SAY 😭😭
Was it just me that, when the Olympics were taking heard “I need to go pee in a cup? 😂
Host meme review
yes very much
Why does Irish sound like  English with no punctuations?
county louth sounds like rtgame lmao
Would you rather stay where you are and stay with Evelyn or go back to Ireland and leave her?🤔
When the acsent is so thick that it sounds like it is a new language...
Jack I just wanted to say thank you keeping me happy for years
Brad Pitt isn’t attempting just any Irish accent, he is attempting the “Irish Traveller” accent! 😁
p o t a t o e   p o p u l a t i o n
Unus Annus is shaking right now
it's not Irish it's Irit
I'm really good at understanding pretty much every accent but this... It just sounds like syllables and mumbling.
after hearing jack for so long a few of these were surprisingly understandable sfjhskds
Irishman reviewing irish accent! So much irish!
listening to jack translating is like witnessing black magic
The channel Facts reacted to you Jack!
I love this because in Canada all of the Newfie/Newfoundland accents are a fun Irish mix. It's great. You can either understand them a bit or it's just pure madness, especially when they're drinking.
Irishman says he’s good at Irish accent
Am Northern Irish
This is hilarious 😂
Ngl I love the Irish accent. It's hot
Du ye haav sheventeen cent fur de hostil
Jack have you ever heard an Newfoundland accent it’s a lot like Irish
Jack asks if that what he sounds like. Sometimes I have trouble understanding when he records with other Irishmen.
Jack, could you do a another accent vidoe but with Swedish accent??? :D :D
I wonder... what's the difference between scotish and irish accent?
"UGH, you're lucky you're gorgeous"
Not gonna lie jacks accent reminds me of my grandpa he died when I was 8 but we used to talk all the time and it always brings a smile to my face when I here him talk
You are VERY easy to understand. I thoroughly enjoyed your legitimate translating!
I vote jack
Stealing CallMeKevin's ideas i see
Jack's not irish confirmed
Holy fuck mate 😂 that was rough to understand
I’m actually half Irish but was raised around American parents because I’m adopted. So jack if you see this can I play among us with you sometime?
Can you please do another one!!!❤❤❤❤
Anyone else think Sean translating is like C-P3O translating
movie accent cringe is heavily felt in boston as well lol
I’ve been to every county In Ireland 3 times
Half of these ones don't even sound like their counties
8:26 he sounds like if james stewart tried to be irish
what accent does nogla have
Mirrrrrrrrrrrrrrr there ya go 😁😂
If Sean Connery could be a Russian submarine captain, Christopher Walken can be Irish lol
This video has made my day.   Thanks for posting it.
What a sexy accent that farmer had
So i clicked on this video with my volume on 100% sean made me drop my phone
Sup
the guy that lost his sheep just had a stroke while talking
People with strong Irish accents me: why are they speaking minecraft enchantment table?
I loved this video so much just hearing how Irish is supposed to sound and how movie stars do it 😂
Jack you need to watch the comedy stand-up trio Foil Arms and Hog! They're a great bunch of Irish ladds!
@20:34 Jack: all done in good CRACK Me: ahh yes the GOOD CRACK
Christopher just sounds Scottish lol
Every goddamn time I hear Walken now, I hear his ass say "FUCK DA COPS! FUCK 'EM!".
In my opinion Brad Pitt tried to do a really stereotypical accent but he actually followed through with it and made it work. It just works for the character because I don’t think you’re meant to be taking him too seriously.
Like you to watch and see how everyone all over the world
Jack you kinda sus
that sheep guy made me think "Ireland doesn't need a language their accent is their language".
Imagine people who think Jack fakes his accent
I can’t tell if that farmer is speaking English or not....
Yours was the best jack
Nobody sound like that
They all sound like Nogla to me
Im irish lol  And my name is Emily oof
Honestly that sounded more like how to do a Scottish accent for idiots. XD
I dearly wish this'd become a series, boys.
0:43 had me in tears
That's not north dublin my granny lives in north dublin
Americans: frostbite  Irish: frustbutt   Me: 👁👄👁
5:10 my mother tongue is Spanish, but I've been studying English since I was about 4 years old. I have no fucking idea of wtf it's going on in the video.
All of this makes me want to go rewatch The Boondock Saints......Again.
Mirrrrr
Seán! Will you please say,  "I may be daft, girl, but I'm not blind." "You know why I'm called the dark one?" "'cause his brain's full shoe polish and it's leaking out." Also, I love your videos. Those lines are from my favorite Irish movie.
*Cries in french*
Cousin that first showed your channel to me in 2014 told me u now only want money and subs I punched him and broke his nose while laughing my ass off and saying HAHA POOR
You should react to some more accents! Also i love when you do videos with no plan behind it. Just seeing you having fun and enjoying yourself is enough!
Southside Dublin: hello there Me in robot voice: General Kenobi
father jack
It's mad how there are different accents for different counties. I'm from Dublin by the way 😂
I'm still debating whether or not to move to Ireland, its such a great place, the folk are grand and when i was in there it just clicked with me. Great buncha lads!
As a Dutch person I can’t even understand some of the HEAVY accents in the Netherlands, I think this must be similar =]
i know what mikey was saying my great granny and grandad was from kerry so i was there most my life and i have some stories he drove a zetor from half way across ireland
I could understand most of what that farmer was saying but in parts I was clueless
Jack is so Irish he eats Potatoes for breakfast 🥔
Bro I’m half Irish and I can’t even do an Irish accent
I think I'm getting used to it. Once you got the the Olympic guys, I fully understood what they were saying
when the olympics guys’ accents sound close to Niall Horan’s accent so you understand what they’re saying from years of experience
"mUsic you call it? MUsic...." he sounded so offended and it made me laugh
Idk why but I'm American and I could understand more of that accent than most probably
i am in awe of the fact that kevin, a 100% irishman, couldn't understand that southern guy with the sheep and sean over here with his 64% is blowing it right out of the park
He soubds like hes wafflling
I remember Call Me Kevin reacting to sheep man. And frostbit boy
My favorite accent is the Cajun accent. I also like their food
Ah yes,this is the best birthday gift I could have askes for!Thank you Sean for uploading this onto my birthday!
I visit Ireland every year and honestly that lady nailed it. Jacks problem is he has a hybrid British Irish accent so it doesn’t sound completely Irish.
Sean you should get your liver checked man. That orange around your eyes doesnt look good, unless its make up.
Nogla has a great Irish accent
I am Irish but I didn't grow up in Ireland and I also do not have an accent.
Frosh-butt xD
Where is the Corpse accent at
Jack: This is a reaction video  Me: He just wants to play the irsh part in a movie
👁👄👁
How many sheep?  Farty five 🤣
Seán I’m irish to
Drinking more milk tell that to a guy your telling him to get taller  Tell that to a women and most likely your one of those guys
Is Sean going into toad sage because there’s orange stuff around his eyes
THIS VIDEO IS GOLD!!!
Apparently I've so many Irish relatives  I'm now a Rosetta stone for the accent. Early exposure is key.
There’s a fun Irish monster movie called Grabbers. It has the same not-quite-comedy feel as the original Tremors and was filmed on a beautiful little island in the tropical North Atlantic. :)
Ya'll feel about the Irish the same way Germans feel about Austrians. Can't understand a word we're saying.
Well Kevin was stumped on that accent Jack can't believe u were able to translate it lol
Is the pirate accent just Irish this whole time
I really loved this video. Can’t believe blindboy boat club made an appearance. Don’t worry you’ll always be welcomed back with open arms. 🇮🇪
Where is the Corpse scent at
a ton of irish accent videos including the sheep lads, frostbit boi, and irish rowers were all in my recommended yesterday... spooky but awesome
if you wanna hear thick Dublin accent listen to Versatile - Glossary - the one without lyrics first :))
I really liked this video! I have a lot of school stress from tests and we're going back to school from home again and I hate it... So this fun vid was awesome!!!
Hoot hoot hoot hoot hoot hoot hoot
Yah u fecking moved to Brighton lad
is no one going to talk about the reference to the rubber bandits
*Scotland being the 3rd sexiest accident* me: WHO THINKS IS ALRIGH TO HEAV A SHET AND NOT FLUSH THE TOILET
SEAN! Herb is said with a silent “H” and a slight emphasis on the vowel, as in eurb- or eurbs- as this is part of the French origination of the word, adding a very slight “U” sound before the “R.”
Those farmers' accents sounds like what a cornish accent sounds like to a posh/middle class person in the uk 🤣🤣
"It's all done in good craic" is something you shouldn't say to anyone who doesn't know what craic means.
I'm irish but I don't have an accent help
You have to do more
You mean to tell me that guy is speaking eNgLISh??!??
PARK! GARDEN! FECK! DRINK! GIRLS!
Don’t worry guys it’s all done in good crack
Just like Spanish, everyone in South America and Central America speak differently and sometimes we just do not understand each other. Specifically.. Slangs OMG Slangs I'm lost there.
We went to a pub in ... somewhere in south of ireland last summer. And a guy asked us  something and it took forever and he had to repeat himself so often. He was just asking where we're from and what we're doing and so on. We were so so sorry! We just had a very hard time to understand him 😅
I love all kinds of accents. All different kinds of Irish, Scottish, Asian, English, and so on. Listening to the natural song of voice makes me feel like I'm listening to my favorite kind of music.
Jack, I would LOVE it if you tried knitting. Ireland and Scotland (and Norway!) originated a lot of knitting techniques that are world famous now! Cable knit sweaters originated from scotland/Ireland. The fisherman's sweater came from there too! It's a dream of mine to visit textile/knitting museums in Ireland and scotland
The fact there was no foil arms and hog is shameful.  Fecking hilarious though.
I mean donegal😂
I watch the irish farmer even with subtitles and still can't get what he mad at, until 3rd times
Sean when ever I watch your video I have a top of the morning cup of coffee to listen up my day
Definately more Curry than Kerry.
when he was translating the Irish my brain clicked on and i could make out some of what he said
I do not understand a thing
Are we all going to ignore the fact that Sean was translating the man with a strong Irish accent.
Séan have you ever visited ireland? I live there🙃
I was waiting for the Cork accent , GWAN THE BAIS. We do have a very strong accent
I'm from the southeast but the southwest is where the accents are mad
ar ya sher tha th'r speken engish
Sweden is seven?? Hell yeah xD Heja Sverige!
man i wish i was born somewhere where they have a cool accent...i was born in the midwest in the USA...we have like the plainest, most boring accents in the world XD
only irish people can like this comment
HOT FUZZ! Yes! Amazing film
A lion a witch and a wardrobe walk into a bar in belfast and the bartender says get out I'm serving  none of ya (nan ey ya)
Hey seán, you should do Scottish accents for your video and I love Irish
Jack which part of Ireland are you from?
Is it weird I knew what sheep man was saying??
Isn't that the video the Irish news wanted you to translate?
If you want to hear America’s weirdest accent, check out the accent on Tangier Island off the coast of Virginia.
That sheep farmer was from Kerry that's why no one understands him
i like them all
I wanna hear jack and his friends sing "what will we do with a drunken sailor?"
Theres so much variety in Irish accents like, I went to a school 20 miles from my village and people at school could tell what area I was from from my voice. 20 miles difference. Mental
Irish accents😳 WHY ARE THEY SO GODDAMM ATTRACTIVE
I think Sean does a better Christopher Walken accent better than Christopher Walken doing an Irish Christopher Walken
Ogh.. That's amazing lad. just wait till they hear like ''Irish Language'' or ''Scots-Gaelic'' ya buggah's wouldn't comprehand that either i supposse.. now innit? Scots n Irish, Bloodbrothers to eachother, and both hating England with a passion lol
Okay. So. In my university back in Russia we had like linguistic variation classes, I studied English in particular. The final task was to present any accent, so obviously I chose the Irish one and showed some of the videos from this video:D  Thanx for interesting cultural details like "stab city"! Hah
when the old Irish man spoke in my greek tiny head it sounded like the Japanese you hear in anime
You sound more like Christopher Walken than Christopher Walken.
5:05 Wait, is that like, Gaelic or is it English ? I genuinely can't understand anything, especially the beginning, it sounds like a half-assed attempt to speak Chinese.
I’m Irish, but raised in America, and I understood the speech. It was funny to hear my sister not be able to tell what they were saying
Ack be jases
Kevin! How dare you steal Jack's idea ahead of time?!!
what i was hearing before sean "translated" the old men: obbe weehlan lum sker jheuna sean: he said all you need is a good dog me: hmmm okay, now i see it!!
Also, Irish definitely wasn't the sexist accent last I checked a few years ago. I get the feeling our Gaelic Gladiator has something to do with this...
The sheep man's accent is the equivalent of a thick Cajun accent in America. No one can understand them 😂
I loved this so much
No one:  Brad Pit: AjhIDHEOWkwkqhilBEIGHQLJKSQODqhnwf
That "Kerry" girl is probably from Northern Ireland.
The frostbite one was Scottish not Irish it was an aberdonian accent
Sean's pretty much the reason y it's so great...no lie I love it when he says bastard.😂
Jack not understanding that the guy with a spare bag is from the rubber bandits
Brad Pitt in Snatch is supposed to be a Traveller, they even call it out that what they're speaking isn't exactly English and isn't exactly Irish, they speak they way they do because it's confusing to non-Travellers.
I'm not going to lie I couldn't figure out who was talking during the Olympic 2016. I was like wait so the left one wasnt talking? Both their mouths are open at one point.
News Caster: Farty Five Sheep went missin'  Sean: Waaaow FARTY Five Sheep?   😂
Why did you make this, are you trying to flex your diversity?
Every time i hear Irish accent, I'm like NOGLA, NOGLA, NOGLA!!
One of the ads on this video is how to cook a potato
2:21  Gru? Is that you?
im irish and my grandad has the same accent as the sheep man
As an Irish men  myself, the accents here are hard to understand 😂
Jacksepticeye accent is my favorite ;D
I HAD FUN~! I feel like I haven't watched you in a while!! THIS WAS AMAZING! I was dying laughing, I really love videos like this lol do a couple more :P I think they'll do good, but keep it sweet :P
Omg, please do more videos like these in the future!
Brad Pitt is doing a gypsy accent (I'm pretty sure). A mix of Irish (Gaelic) and the mutt-of-a-mix of ethnicities gypsy's are. They're the cold-weather Cajuns of Ireland/Scotland/Greenland. I'm a 6th generation Gaelic Scott and I can't even understand em without the subtitles lol.
Jack: "top of the morning is so cringe!" Also Jack: Has a top of the morning shirt on while filming the video, named his coffee brand top of the morning and said top of the morning everyday for at least 5 years
Jack’s accent without his Irish lads: Very weak Jack’s accent when he is doing anything that is Irish related: STRONK
and in the netherlands we have 2 official languages one of them i say is still a dialect nobody can understand but its called fries the otehr part of the neterlands also have some dialects but only a few speak it most can understand but not speak it
You should’ve included Marks Irish accent
Me: *gawking at the fact he can translate that shit*
Irish accents.... think of them as dialects..... XD
I had no idea there were so many Irish accents.... I need to travel more!
Jack in the thumbnail looks kinda like ugly gru
I from Ireland 🇮🇪
Please do a review of the movie once it comes out. We all want to laugh with you. Plz.
I Wonder how it feels for him to look back on him celebrating  1000 subscribers and now he has over 20 million I wonder how crazy that feels and Sean I know you’ll never see this but thank you I wouldn’t be alive if it weren’t for you you got me through some tough times
"What the fuck Jeff" 😂
One of my favorite videos we need a part 2
2:21 your christopher walken is as good as his Irish.
Oof
Sean I’m from co. Limerick from the country side and lived on a hill two hours from limerick itself and I have the thickest accent and the one guy from Kelly I just couldn’t understand a word    That voice coach too when she goes the beautiful harmony of a voice. What the living fuck you say it areland. Not Ireland ARELAND    The Stab city joke... yeah no
the more you listen to irish accents and jack's translation makes some of the accents more understandable
This is making my day.
“Leprechauns on acid”
Its crazy to see how much of an influence the Irish accent had on places in Canada where I live is places like nova Scotia in cape breton or in newfoundland
i laughed so hard at the merrion part because i live in mount merrion lmaoooo
My dads Irish and when he says mirror I always say “where’s the gold and frankincense?!” Because it sounds like myrrh! 😂
Sean you sound more like a Canadian than an Irishman.  Come join us in Canada! ;)
The Irish man is good at an Irish accent shocking
I understand how Jack finds people who aren't Irish try to speak with an Irish accent funny 100% I'm the same way but with American accents, especially when they try to do a southern accent
The Limerick spar bag was a reference to the rubber bandits who are two Irish blokes from Limerick who made music and wore bags on their heads. Please please please listen to some of their songs like horse outside. It’s absolute class
I'm a native American English speaker and we have a default "standard American English" accent that is often considered ideal. Here regional accents are gradually becoming associated with being poor and/or uneducated. It's always cool to me to see that in Ireland (and England, I suppose) accents are treated as a normal and universal part of a culture that can be celebrated.
The more I listen the more I can understand
i miss the "AND IL SEE ALL YOU DUDES.................... IN THE NEXT VIDEOOO!!!"
loven ot
Jack you often say wHile instead of while, is that a joke or is your accent?
I could understand a few words the sheep man was saying. Mostly the word "sheep" Also, Brad Pitt sounded like he was either drunk or had a slur
Ngl, when they say sexiest accents they prolly mean women
Ok the reporter's name was either: mac and cheese OR mac and tetties, change my mind
my mother weirded out by me smiling to words i cant even understand
Anyone talks irish feels like your funny frined
ORELAND>IRELAND FLRRR>FLOUR
Hey im very Irish but i dont live in ireland
There’s so many countries and regions like this, where people think there’s only one accent when there’s tens maybe hundreds. There’s no African accent, no (US) Southern accent, no Irish accent, etc. Compare a South African to a Nigerian or a Texan to an Appalachian, they’re all drastically different.
I'm dying..haha
Your Walken impression is better than his Irish accent... LOL
Every town, has a different accent! And the hilarious part is if your from an irish town you can work out where the other bloke is from just by listening to their accent. Also, I pronounce mirror "murrrr" so... I can relate to that Sean.
This is how I felt in “Devil All the Time” when they hired all British, Scottish, and Australian actors to play southern people from West Virginia
now try to talk filipino...  it has 300+ variations
The second hand embarrassment in this video was TOO MUCH
2:22 jack sounds like grew from Despicable Me
You are so violent
Dont worry jack its the same here in America, The further down you go the less you can understand what people are saying XD
Americans be like: my relatives five generations ago came from Ireland/ italy so I am 100% Irish/Italian
I feel like this video made your accent STRONGER 🤣🤣
12:20 That's why no one can do an American accent. America is so big, that there is so many ways people speak English. Like for example, how people in the South talk different then people in the North, talk different from people from the East, talk different from people in the west
I'm not the only one that want to watch it just because of the horse right?
what i understand from the farmer : "sowkdpoid doicjeoc ekceofem eoidcoei SHEEP podko dcjeokdcoe wlkced eceojcneojf FARTY FIVE SHEEP wkmdxowdnewjdweclw wlcekiwoe wokcw SHEEP pcdp eindciecdnei odjcoe GOOD DOG."
People say the Irish accent is hard to understand. Y'all haven't heard the mf APPALACHIAN accent
Sean what's your irish accent
lol loved the video i have not watched any of your videos in a long time almost a year but coming back seeing this awsome
Can someone crop the part where the woman says "our" (11:49)  and put the soviet national anthem after it.
So this is what our english listening tests are based on
This video went from "Bad Irish accents" to "This is what Irish accents ACTUALLY sound like"
Imagine being in a war and your General says this to you: YELADS GON DED CE TE! GAB GOON AND FORE ATAY!
I live in Limerick about an hour's drive from Kerry and I could not for the life of me understand what that farmer was saying except for a few words.
Now I want to know what you think of the accents of the actors in the movie Pixi. Cuz they’ve been praised for getting it right.
Apparently, when my great-grandfather - who was from Waterford - was drunk, he more or less sounded like the farmer who had his sheep stolen....was golden to listen to Also, hailing from the South West of the UK, I can confirm that the accent of the hedge cutting farmer in Hot Fuzz is legitimate as I have an uncle that talks like him
Hey can someone translate? It's so Irish I can't understand 😂
Fuck you Ireland!   - Love, from Italy :)
E X C U S E M E? All I heard were vague mouth noises??????? This is giving me flashbacks to foreign language classes
This it what i think people hear when they speak to scandinavians😂
I just found out that I'm irish!!!
the old guy sounds like hes from iceland
It's so cool he translated for us!! It's been a short while since I've seen one of his videos and he's still nice...
Ah jack you need to listen to rubberbandits
Lol this is too funny.
The irish acsent feels like with the lads drinking until we pass out
Where in Ireland is Nogales accent from because it is real thick sounding
i love how jack is putting out more irish content and streaming with the lads lately, these are my favourite!
When Jack skips out on the six counties :( our terrible accent needs recognised
I just heard an Irish man tries to be an American man who tries to be an Irish man.
all i thought of being from kilkenny that i assumed he would just look at people from cork or dublin farmers
Funny enough, that Wild Mountain Thyme movie has Jamie Dornan in it, who's from the North. I'm tempted to blame it on that.
that rowing team would be 100x faster if that guy waxed his shoulders
anyone being like it's *northern ireland lol
Jack straight up has one of the best Subscriber to Non Subscriber ratios I've ever seen
Everyone say it with me: MIRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
Dafock?? me aint british but me understand dont 😂 me axcent
*oil*
Irish person: ih taek eh the goots os fordergoeherherhmm The world: thats the sexiest accent ive ever heard
This video has convinced me that Irish people don't speak English bcuz wtf 😭😭😭💀
I agree. Sexiest accent. I'd just love to talk to an Irish woman
Voted most sexy accent??? By who??? Lol cause its definitely far from sexy
So you british right 🤣😁
Pretty sure a Yorkshire accent and an Irish one are distant cousins; because I'm pretty sure you get that same range!
I’m slowly understanding what their saying
its like in norway its so many accents and some are so hard to understand
Ah, development in my mission to figure out what allos find sexy: Irish is sexy.
Accent coach made me think of Swedish Chef from The Muppets
Are there a lot of big cities in Ireland? I've always pictured it like the way it looked in the sheep video
Dude he sounds like the guy from water boy
as an irish person , the farmer was almost impossible to understand everyone else was fine. and jack made "top of the morin' to ya" a stereotype XD
I miss “Top if the morning to ya” jack we still love you❤️
David Boreanaz’s Irish accent in Angel was hilariously bad— so bad, in fact, that he decided to stop doing it.
oh didn't you know? in hollywood it's illegal for the actor to have ANYHTING in common with the character they're playing. asians can't play asian characters, autistic people can't play autistic characters, trans people can't play trans characters etc nope not allowed ever because then it wouldn't be ~~~~ _acting_ ~~~~
Jack: “Go back to bed child, start drinking more milk bitch... *wheezes* “
It sounds like a Norwegian with the flu trying to speak english
Im a corkonian and i feel personally attacked
Have you done one of the videos before? for some reason I thought I already had a memory of you talking about the lost sheep farmer...
MORE OF THIS PLEASR
i dont know they all sound like leprechauns to me
Holy s*** I can actually understand them pretty fluently
“Fler ser”
Didn't he do this video already? Edit: 4:53 SEE, I SWEAR HE DID THIS KIND OF VIDEO ALREADY, RIGHT THERE WHEN HE SEARCHED FOR THAT VIDEO IT HAS THE RED BAR ON THE BOTTOM INDICATING IT WAS ALREADY WATCHED. I'M NOT CRAZY
First I thought the farmer was speaking German.
nice!
Did anyone else read that one name as "Sean Mac ant sit high"
HAHA I'M PART IRISH AND SCOTTISH AND FRENCH HAHHAHA (i am not mad)
It’s simple he is saying iwasoutinthefieldbutsheepecameouttotakemesheepwiththemoon
Listening to this is like trying to read Shakespear
thank god I love in the Northern part of Ireland 😂
This is exactly how I feel when people try to do a South African accent. Apparently people think we sound Dutch with a mix of an Australian accent, an example is the Afrikaaner man in the new Amnesia game I think his name was Leon de Vries? He couldn't even pronounce his own surname right! Developers, directors whoever they are NEED to cast people who are from those countries or else everything is just a joke 😂😂😂 like I swear, I'm Afrikaans and all the accent attempts I've heard hurt my actual soul deep down to the damn core. My arme hartjie kry baie seer, ek dink hulle het regtig genoeg geld om die regte mense te kry vir verskillende rolle in films! Anyways Sean love your videos! Greetings from South Africa, Cape Town! 🌼
i cant belive he didnt notice it was a RUBBER BANDIT BOY
I just realised where our Gothenburg accent came from. Search for "Volvo Nvidia presentation" for a true masterpiece of "Svinglish"
Now we need a video of you trynna teach Felix how to speak Irish while he teaches you Swedish
you should just do an entire video speaking in a strong Irish accent
You should look at the Murphy brothers Irish accents in the boondock saints movie xD
I LOVED THIS
Why is it, some bits in this video are pure meme worthy?
My stomach always drops when he doesn’t do his signature intro
Do another video with a video of a limerick accent
Sean's Christopher Walken is way better than Christopher Walken's Irish.
Sean Mac an SIT HIGH
subtitles: (unintelligible)
if theres so many irish accents, then i guess theyre all... Ire-ish
The vocal coach is trying to teach a language but sounds so weird. If I'm going to learn a Irish accent I'm just going to Irish person
Do Irish speak english with accent or they had their own languange??
I feel like I speak normal english
This is so wholesome x
Seán’s Irish Christopher Walken sounds like Arnold Schwarzenegger
Jacks really good looking compared to the people we seen in this video
I love how seans accent thickens whenever hes with the lads, or talking about/reacting to irish culture
THAT OUTRO HAS ME WEAK!!!
I think that irish sound reversed
Why is it always the southern part? 😂
This reminds me of when my friend from cali came to miami and met my friends (highschoolers) and he was so confused and I had to translate what my friends were saying
Worked with so many Irish people and they were/are the funniest people I have ever met !  💪🏼😎👊🏼
“wat the ffffffffock JJeff”
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
See you go in thinking these attempt of accents would be cringy but Jeff just embodied all of the cringe there.
seán: HAHAHAHAH LOL me: smile and wave boys (⊃｡•́‿•̀｡)⊃ smile and wave
I love that Jack had to translate for the sheep farmer
Irish accents get me blood rollin 😍
I haven’t seen jacksepticeye in a long while and I’m glad to see him still the same cheery funny guy.
One of them there rowers mentioned Henley! If I look out the window I can see Henley!
i think the wild mountain thyme is supposed to be like that
The accent should be its own language
This was amazing
Jack's Irish language: *Perfect and beautiful*  Mine: *FIDXJVIDCKSKVSICORIDKFDUGFIVJE ITDIVIDOGO!!!!*
I WANT MOREEEEE
watch welcome to the netherlands youll like it its just like this bud better
“Jack saying christopher Walkins doesn’t sound I rush at all” “Me, convinced by his speaking that he actually grew up in Ireland”
Brad Pitt nailed the gypsy accent
He looked so offended when she said music
I have no idea why they don't just cast people who are the ethnicity that they want. I guess they just prioritize talent over accent. Or maybe just recognizability over accent. Everybody knows who Christopher Walken is. Not sure who the best Irish actor is.
Mikey Joe O'Shea vs Sean McLaughing would be the greatest rap battle of all time.
15:31 YESSSS! Was not expecting to see Cobh on a buzzfeed video but I'm happily surprised! Nice one!
I'm Canadian, and I'm cringing through this!
I'd love more videos like this!!💜😄
That is no longer a Irish accent, that is just scrambled Scottish
that was really fun :D make a other one :P
I'm usually pretty good at understanding other accents, but my goodness that farmer was impossible to understand 😆
my dad is from derry, Northern Ireland and my friends always notice and are like what did he just say? And it always confuses me so much because it just sounds normal to me lmao
Fun fact: I “learned” english with you and I didn’t know that you were Irish so now make sense why take so long😂😂
5:28 Me thinking Do they pronounce 40 as farty  When Jacksepticeye said "farty five" i thought he was gonna talk about it but he never, I guess that's how the Irish pronounce 40
The Irish accent is to accents as 100 gecs is to music
irish people when they fail no nut november:  "Oh so NOW we like me lucky charms aehh?"
Random fact: My wife's cousin was the one who got the tattoo of "Pullin' like a dog". If you know, you know…
11:40 Up here in Northern Ireland, we just say... Mir.  There is no further pronounciation of the other letters, just a single syllables.  And before someone says, "Sure, I'm Northern and I don't say that!" Then come to Belfast!!!
React to a notern Irish accent pliz
the accents going from bad irish, to russian, to boston/russian.
Heeeyyy!! I did the voices in the video from 18:11 onwards and I'm THRILLED that Jack didn't slate me!! 😂😂😂💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼 Yeow! Thanks man!
I'm so happy the last video you showed had the Limerick accent.  That is actually where my great, great grandfather is from.  But honestly the more I watched your video the more I was like, these accents and candances remind of the deep south of America where I'm from 🤣
Your Christopher Walken is better than his Irishman. LMAO
this is the best thank you for sharing these clips
7:25 is absolutely incorrect. The only thing we talk about is the virus.
I can't believe jack didn't realize the guy with the bag on his head was one of the rubberbandits
Ah Jesus as a Cork lad myself I’m cringing like the back of bail here
Sean, I think the reason they don't hire Irish actors is that you needed to translate the accent because it's that much of a foreign language
“Eat shit French”  Damn, that hurt
This girl sounds like ms.doutfire 11:50
Jack we need subtitles for some of these 😂😂
i guess my voice is sexy now
I’m also Irish, but my Irish accent is horrible
South African is second this year
took me to just when you were translating the sheep farmer to get it.
my grandmother is Irish but I'm not bc im adopted so I'm actually British.
Im from kilkenny and watching this is bizarre
Now Ik how my friends that don’t know English feel like
This was great! :) When my hubby and I were trying to learn Italian, one of the podcast teachers was from Scotland. So she was saying Italian phrases with a hybrid accent, and we were so intrigued that we went down an accent rabbit hole. We listened to Scotts, Irish, and other English-like languages and accents. So interesting!!
btw what happened to Gizbo
Bai I used to live in Cork and this gave me MAD nastalgia
i thought the old guy was talking in german and saying sheeps in between
jacksepticeye MILK GANG???
unpopular opinion (clearly) : I don't think the Irish accent is sexy...  And I'm not saying that cuz I'm french  I sure think it's nice and I tend to be filled with happiness when I hear it because of Jack but that's it
Where is Conor McGregor 😂
God I love an Irish accent. It either turns you on, or baffles you as to what they're saying. Brilliant
14:04  “I think I’ve talked ABOOT this before “ I laughed way to hard ejdjdijfkf
i watched the lady at the end for our play! we are doing an irish play for school :)
Boondock Saints review?
These are worse than being sent to the guillotine
I’ve been waiting for this one
The luck of the Irish disney movie
Why does jack look 50 years old? What happened?
7:44 nah man, I *learnt* English pronunciation from your videos as a teenager, it was much clearer to understand than most
"Eat shit France"  as an Englishman, that makes me happy
As a kerryman, even I have a tough time understanding the Kerry accent sometimes.
I could understand like every other word but Mikey the farmer was saved
Can we get Sean to react to the TRY channel??
The girl from County Kerry is fucking gorgeous!!!  😍
I didn't find any of these accents hard to understand. When you deal with the American speaking heavy yooper for long enough hard to find an accent that's harder to understand.
5:07  I understand Weihnachten (Christmas) and Freundin (Girlfriend)
I was hoping he was going to rate Norman Reedus and Sean Flanerys Irish accent on The Boondocks Saints. Pls do another one lol
18:29 sounds scottish lmao
Im lrish county down. jack Ireland has not changed. and i got so pissed when that jeff fela said there's one accent and if you do come to back to the home land plz come to county down i would love to meet you and we could never get rid of you your always well come in Ireland
I wish the world was such a great place where 45 sheeps go missing is a "Breaking News"
Jackaboy, please bring back SCP Containment Breach! I believe I speak for everyone when I say that we need more of you being a scared Irish potato.  Please?  Signed: A loyal Subscriber.
No u American stop faking
Yur man
Park... garden... arse.. girls!!! 😂
Honestly my favourite irish thing is when people say "you know your mans daughter you know yer wan what's her face you know yer wan I'm talking about
I am irish just putting that out there
I had a friend from Schull, and the first time I flew over to stay at her mum's they introduced me to a couple of the local farmers and then ran off in fits of laughs as my unprepared English ass tried to make sense of what they were saying. Couple of the maddest accents I've ever heard.  Spent some time in Ballydehob and Skibbereen too
whenever I try to do an irish accent I end up sounding scottish.  I am terrible at accents
This could've been jacks first movie
Brad bit feels like irish in nutshell
I feel like the only reason I understood some of the stronger ones (frostbit, the rowers) is cuz I've watched Jack for years.
2:32 sounds more Scottish than Irish 🗿😂
I remember going to Ireland in 2017 and loving the accents. We went from Killarney to Dublin. Such a beautiful country! Such amazing accents too! We sat in one of the pubs and there were just some old men talking. I miss Ireland. I’d love to go back!
You should react to the Irish fiddle next or another musical instrument that sounds Irish
I can't I'm allergic to a ingredient that is put in milk so it stays in the milk after the process it goes through
I love this video so much but *THERE WASNT A SINGLE WEST OF IRELAND ONE*
5:40 I, being Irish AND from Kerry, find this very relatable. It still remains hilarious.
The dog and a horse sound more Irish than the actors.
"The Irish accent voted Sexiest in the World 2020" -published August 1, 2019  Me:*visible confusion*
Why are all of the sexiest accents from European countries? Seems like a biased list.
that frostbit kid sounds strangely like Jeremy Irons....hmmmm very interesting
Mirror in Northern Ireland is either just “murrr” or “mirrr” bit of knowledge there for you
Jesus died for you was buried and rose again on the third day according to the scriptures   If you confess with your mouth Jesus is lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead you will be saved. Please repent of your sins and accept Jesus Christ as your lord and savior
Thank fucking god we have jacksepticeye. Google would even have been able to decode that shit.
Your not irish unless you say mirrrrrrrr
That dude almost sounds swedish
The hard Irish accents feel like listening to another language
Love it XD I moved to Norn Iron with my other half who's from here originally, and it's better than England in all ways, especially the accents XD
all I could hear was “my legs are like jelly and then it took me 2 hours too pee” 😭
Im trying to get rid of my north english accent it needs to be put away
This video just proved that I still havent learned english very well.
Would have loved to see him react to Tommy Tiernan with his Cork accent imitation.
the irish accent is just a very long drunken slurrrrrrrrr
he's also from Kerry, the outskirts near dingle
tHAT man at @5:57 is talking in english right?
You used to sound a lot like that but not any more
Jack: Makes fun of the phrase “Top of the Morning” Also Jack: Wears a Top of the Morning Coffee t-shirt
So, considering english isn't even my first language, I was just utterly confused during the whole video. Still very fun, though
theirishaccentisbasicallytheequivalenttotypingamessagewithnospaces.
I WANT A WHOLE VIDEO OF JACK WITH HIS ACCENT
Me an Irishman : What’s this Englishman know about accents
This video Made me happy today I love you Jack for everything you do. Hope you see this🥰🥰🇮🇷
my grandfathers accent is even heavier somehow
I'm pretty sure a clip of that farmer was on a show called Harry Hill's TV Burp. He had different sections and this one was "I Beg Your Pardon? Of the Week". Fucking hilarious
Jack is so Irish he eats potatoes for breakfast 🥔
Hell no it isn’t cringy jack top of the mornin intro with the smack is the best intro on yt I love it it’s been something I’ve heard since I watched u play happy wheels when I was a kid like below guys if u think he should bring it back😂
"'Top of the Morning' Irish people don't say that." While wearing his Top of the Morning shirt lol
Jack slowly realizing he's Americanized his accent over the years...
"What the fuck Jeff!?" got me so bad holy
what if i drink a gallon o'milk a day mate?
All o tem
My father was in a brotherhood in collage in west VA and he was working a hotdog stand at a carnival and my dad asked this kid “what can I do ya for” and this kid said “merph aneph eh dephea” and my dad asked “what?” And he repeated the same thing, so his friend who is native west VA translated what the kid said and told my dad “the kid wants a jalapeño dog and a coke” my dad still wonders how the hell he got that from what the kid said.
2:23 sound like Arnold Schwarzenegger 🤣
*“shut up you son of a truck’s mother”*
I can't even Understand a single word from MIKEY JOE O'SHEA
I haven't seen Snatch but if he's supposed to be a traveler then it's actually pretty good lmao
all I know is BEATENS!
I’m realizing now that the Midwest of the states (where I’m from) has a similar accent to jack now.... bet if you get my drunk enough I’ll sound like the guy that lost the sheep
youre dad looks like eazy-e !
Anytime sean is with more Irish people his accent gets ×1000
Wait, where are you living right now?
He should listen to the paddy losty video
jack you have given about 300k people bad ideas of what irish people do
Thats great now I can say more than top of the morning to ya laddies, cause that gets cringy fast.
Petition to put every Irish gaming YouTuber in a room for a couple hours and call it a podcast
For Snatch, director Guy Ritchie directed Brad Pitt like that because Americans complained about his previous film (Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels) that they couldn't understand their accents. So with Snatch, he had Brad Pitt do an accent that barely anyone could understand in revenge I guess 😂
dont worrie i know what you say just not them
for a long time, while learning english, I thought Ireland had their own language. I didn't know it was english too
4:25 Looks like Post Malone
7:24 I shouldn't find something this true to me this funny.  World: going up in flames Irish news channels: aw well sure Aisling's lost a few sheep this winter  so s'has and there's lovely moons and that lovely; grand full moonand the mountains with your dog for if you , would'yas all make sure to wrap up sure it'll be feckin cold and all that. g'day yous all. Would'ya passmyfeckincoffeeoveryadaftbugger ayethankyouSiobhanlovelythings. Anyone: wha- sheep- Irish people: SURE THE WEATHERS TO BE FUCKIN BALTIC GRAB YER JACKET. Good woman yerself, Siobhan.   I also find it funny that when I talk to people not FROM Ireland or the UK they're like "Oh wait, you're Irish what about your accent?"  and I gotta sit there knowing I am forcing my voice to be any level of understandable to them like please that's not just me.
And I though i struggled hearing Nigerian accents
Another thing is that I'd like to thank jack for helping me through the years, but also God damn you. You are the reason why just because I watch you and have Irish ancestors I have grown to be a partially unintelligible, incoherent speaking, scrawny boy.
He should react to Adam B's accent
You k.ow what I've never seen a female irish person. EVER  But i confused if those women were actually irish
If you look at an american say they all sound the same they'd cause an uproar, someone from texas won't sound like someone from new york or minnesota. Yet they just kinda assume that every other country (ireland in this example) will have one accent. Just like your accents change with regions so does everyone elses.........americans man 😑
Me thinking I understood what the farmer was saying:  :) Me when Sean translates and it's nothing like what I was thinking:  :(
The Irishmen and women with those thick accents sound like Newfies LMAO, most Newfies came from Cork and Munster so it makes sense
I speak with a ulster scot accent a notern Irish one
I can uder stand what the British guys is saying that Jack can't under stand DBSJDVSJAHS
Mirrrrrrrrrrrrrrr...
Jack don't tell me you don't know Blind Boy with the spar bag? He's from the rubberbandits, cmon
i love irish and scottish accents more than british accents. i just think they're more interesting to listen to
I wish he wore... the hat more
Pascal Shehee rte news cork
Sean teasing other Irish people for their different dialects is very reminiscent of Illinosians who do the SAME THING. In rural Central Illinois, we have these weird "southern" accents. If you go to far north, people start to say "hot dog" and "mom" like the fucking words are spelled with "a" instead of "o" and it's horrendous. Then on the Illinois side of the Mississippi, near Saint Louis everyone sounds pretty uninteresting. There's not much of a lilt or change in their voice for most words. And I've no actual idea what the southern tip of Illinois even sounds like. It's the only damn place we've got trees and "hills" but I've never been. 😂
was honestly hoping he'd review Far and Away
Jack: Are you gonna say flaur? And saur? Lady: Floor
ok i think i decided which irish accent was the funniest and interesting......this guy names jacksepticeye
I want to see Sean try to do different Irish accents now 😂
You should react to Conor McKenna's first interview in 2015. He played Aussie Rules Football for Essendon, he's originally from Tyrone. Couldn't understand a fucking word he said.
Why wasn’t ethan in this video? ... sorry
Sure you're right about Southern accents here. I'm from cork and the accents are mad down around here
Never knew the struggles of so many Irish school children getting “frost butt”.  So sad.
He said start drinking more milk bitch but I was already drinking a glass while I was watching the video and I was on my  5th glass
What I read: Seán Mac an tsithigh What I hear in my head: Seen Mac and See Thigh
Thyme for some Cheeze an herbs.
That sheep farmer almost sounded like he was swedish or maybe german idk xD
I think I don't find many thick Irish accents too difficult to understand (except those farmers good god!) because I'm Welsh. We also have rather strong accents and speak incredibly fast 😂😂 so we're used to it to a certain extent
all im thinkin about is ethan trying to do an irish accent
Is it weird that I actually sorta get it?
Man you want a linguistic experience, try the Newfie accent.  So interested if you can understand them... cause yikes
I am starting to think that Ireland is just some fairy tale land and doesn’t actually exist (and mind that I’ve been there and loved it)
Welcome to America where they use every white person they can find to play different cultures instead of getting actual people of that culture lmao
6:46 fortnite
True
Nah Pascal shehee is better
Tbf travellers in the U.K. do sound like that.
Watch a Kerry accent
3:40 excuse me are you trying to say words because you’re failing epically
I didn't exspect this video to be this funny lol😂😂
2:22 kinda sounds like gru from dispicable me
HOW CAN YOU UNDERSTAND THE SHEEP VIDEO OMFG?!?!?!
13:28 General Kenobi
10:51 Oh god, that face! X'D I'm saving that for meme time
Cillian Murphy’s accent in Disco Pigs is the strangest Irish accent I’ve ever heard. It doesn’t get better with the weird dialogue either.
Subscribe
bruh, Europe doesn't only have different dialects, it has different languages xD
*proceedstotalkwithoutspaces*
Apparently I’m 74% Irish so that’s good
Do all of irish people have pale skin?
When I try to do an Irish accent but it just makes my fenland accent stronger instead lol
The farmer is the equivalent to the assistant coach in the water boy
Sean trying to do Irish Christopher walken sound like Arnold Schwarzenegger
This is how he got to date Gab xD
2:53 omg Jason Statham 😘
The sheep guy speaks Minecraft enchantment table... actually almost all of them do
At least he didn’t diss Scotland as much as Italy or france
Alternate title: Jacksepticeye Criticizing His Own Culture for 21 minutes straight
As an Italian, I feel ashamed yet proud of losing to your GLORIOUS accent
0:23 Italian and French: I'm about to end this whole man's career
the channel "Overly Sarcastic Productions" did a video on Ireland if you're interested. I thought it was really enjoyable. There's one about the history of Ireland and then another about Irish folklore called the "Book of Invasions".  That was a lot of fun to watch. please please please look into it, Jack.  I think you'd like it a lot :D
MEME TIME WHEN
<3 <3 <3
So that’s why when I watch jack I get tingles down my spine
I feel like he would of had a blast reading the Irish side of twitter
Thanks Jack you're pretty great yourself man I wish I had more of an irish accent but oh well can't have it all I suppose.
7:43 "Seen Mac An T-Sit High" is a tough lad to be understood
No offense to Irish and Chinese but I really thought at first he was talking chinese
I havent laughed so hard since Unnus Annus ended
I adore Irish accents. And seeing you having fun with this made it ten times better.
I think the only reason i can understand this it because i have a Canadian actsent
how jack feels in this video is how africans feel while watching black panther.
Irish aint an accent its a language
Jack translating what the farmer was saying was just... it just felt like a guy translating for someone with a speech impediment.
as a foreigner I have no clue what half of these people said XD
Sean: WHAT THE FAWK JEFF
I blew up the white house.  :)
the “Irish” accent they gave to the jester in the dub of black butler circus  DISGUSTING
Sorry Jack but some of your accent had decreased over the years
next video Sean needs to do the entire thing in his heaviest Irish accent the entire time
Irish ARE just built differently but in the BEST way <3
Please do another amd react to boondock saints
As an Irish person this was fucking hilarious
I had to focus *so hard* until I started understanding more clearly
have you seen boondonk saints?
HAHAHA Go back to bed child, drink some more milk B****!
How was I not subbed I was watching for a long while
I’m Irish
My Luvver?! That's a Somerset thing!!
I love this kind of video
Heavy Irish should be considered another language ngl
play among us with the irish lads!!
i love the real kerry accent
maybe he was just speaking gaelic—
how is it that i an american understand more irish than the irish potato of youtube does
I love how Felix just imitated Irish accent recently
Your one or owfala
Great vid
Who is Missing TOP OF MORNING!!!!
English speaking countries to Ireland: “What did you say?” Hispanic countries to Puerto Rico: “... what did I just listen to?”
I could understand about 70% I would say. As a non native speaker, that should be pretty okay.
Being born and raised in Scotland, then moving to the USA for education purposes... whenever I see or hear Shrek I wanna throw up
This is the same as when I hear people doing scottish accents in movies and TV 🤣🤣
i feel like the only reason irish is such a sexy accent is because of irish steve jobs
This farmer who lost his sheeps is a perfect example of how english sounds like to non english speakers
Jack please go play some escapists or sniper elite I really enjoyed those series and I’m sure there are other people that agree🙏🙏
“Léigh go cúramach na ceisteanna ar do scrúd phaipear agus éist go cúramach leis an mír, cloisfidh tú gach mír fa dhó” IRISH PEOPLE iyk yk
These thick Irish accents have kind of similar speech patterns to people where I live in the south west of England,  so I can just about make out what they're saying!
Nogla is way worse than you
I always say “Tip of the coffee and top of the morning to you!” thanks to Jack. Thanks Jack, I now have a favorite phrase.
1:39 why did i laugh at this for 10 minutes tho. Like i cant breathe lmaoooooo
Donegal was voted the sexiest accent in Ireland didn’t even listen to a bit of it I’m ashamed Jack
Jacksepticeye's 'flour sour hour'
1:12 Wendy’s movie commercial
Ireland has the sexiest accent in the world I’m so proudly my country🇮🇪
That’s so (Irish jibberesh)
Those thick accents remind me of when I moved to New Orleans and the first day there I had to go down to the quarter for an interview then I got lost going back to my place. I stopped at a corner store to ask for help, this woman started to and then directed me to her husband because he knew the area better. His Cajun accent was so thick all I understood was something about following the river and the rest of the time I just nodded like I knew what he was saying. 😂 They were so nice I didn't have the heart to tell them I was more lost after our conversation.
sean mcthicc
Aaahhh the age old tongue of potatoes
2:22 GET TO THA CHAPPER
thinks about gaelforce
"Heebdbehsjd moonlight heeddere gootentag dhehhrhdhd"  Ill never forget how that sheep got lost😭
Sexy jack, lol, i miss when ur accent was thicker and u would talk really loud and fast that was such a great time, lol
i can understand irish but i cant understand Scottish. Scottish people talk so fast and it takes me five seconds before I can comprehend what they’re saying
Wait a minute. Is Sean wearing makeup 👀
The fact that Sean could understand and make what sounds like gibberish to making sense blew my mind😂
the accent i loved the most....Seans ^_^ <3
So a dog is a dag?
5:35 all I heard Was "bright out" and mountain" maybe "moon" aswell. LOL
*flashback to Unus Annus*
Snatch is hands down one of the best movies
Is that really a Louth accent or was the guy just a bit camp in his voice?
Note to self: don’t eat spicy food while watching jacksepticeye
Geordie accents make these look like mandarin to a Spanish speaker
Irish hunk: *says something with Irish accent*  Me: "... I don't know if you complemented me or insulted me, but I'm yours, handsome"
Jack should be cast as the lucky charms mascot change my mind
Well Jack I like to think I can do a pretty decent Irish accent lol  I'd love to have you judge it 😁
3rd clip sounds like Ian Paisley
Video idea get Evelyn to pronounce Irish names  like Niamh or Caomhie names like that.
me: sees video title my brain: this is going to be all cork people isnt it
im an Ozzie and even I know that isn't an Irish accent 😂
I loved this video. I had a great time *tought in an Irish accent*
I can’t tell if he’s actually translating the sheep man or pulling it out of his ass
I can do both Irish and Scottish, but usually I accidentally mash them together
Can u play slime rancher is their r any updates pls, it is funny and cute
Sheep guy sounds like a Sim if it was Irish.
I very easily understood everything said in this video. But that sheep farmer... what the actual fark?
Also im a american form Boston but still understood some of that sheep dood
Jack, please teach me the way of the Irish 🙏
i love our nation
any plans on a Ghost of tsushima walkthrough? i would love to see that.
Jack doing Irish Christopher Walken just sounds like Christopher Walken
Bad? You mean Great
F r o s h b u t t
Tf, I’m Italian and French, why you hate so much, like if you are sorry
That was one of the shiniest foreheads i've ever seen wtf
Jacksepticeye has the best Irish accent!
Sean this video: "puts medal on sean"
"M-i and 15 Rs" killed me. Lol
I have always said that I would love to go to Ireland for some drunk adventures. But now I wanna go so I can learn to speak like the farmer 🤣🤣
I like Nogla’s accent, its my favorite irish accent variation
Sean's interpretation of Christopher Walkin's Irish accent sounded legit like Arnold Schwarzenegger...
whats good my dudes
When I first saw you, your accent was a bit hard to get over. I remember thinking "He seems like a cool guy. I look forward to the time when his accent becomes white noise and I can actually pay attention to what he's saying."
Seriously though, I took Irish in college and OH MY GOD THE DIALECTS! It was kind of an excuse when we couldn’t say something right “oh sorry, I’m from Connemara.”
Omg ,what im hearing "😂..
I love it when he says "hard"
As someone who’s been trying to learn Gaeilge for a couple years and has had a love for Irish culture for many years, this video made my heart very happy.
I could understand him just a bit but not alot
Jack saying eat shit france made me lose my shit. idk why
My great grandma was from county antrim
sean didn’t react to northern irish accents :(( well frostbit guy is northern irish i think
It's sounds like if they were speaking chinese with an Irish accent
Aye Jack... I love ireland and i never been there :)
Gawd! That farmer that lost the 45 sheep sounds like a less coherent Daithi de Nogla. (YES got the spelling right the first time!)
Why did it sound like terminator when he said he had a rock tied to his neck or when he said Christopher Walken trying to be Irish
Please watch the Foil Arms and Hog video of them making a trailer for an Irish film. It was made a few years ago and is dead accurate for this trailer 🤣
I’m so glad you’re back on the internet. You make my days. 😁
I'm from Scotland.
But wait, if that's a Limerick accent , the fuck's up with Becky Lynch's accent then?
jack! there’s an irish comedy group called foil, arms & hog! idk if you’ve ever heard of them but they’re hilarious and you should check them out
I'm Irish and I can't understand 😂
Casually eats mango
I’m completely British but I’m glad I could understand the rowers :D
Me trying to understand, when English is not even my first language...
Jackyboi..... You died :(
the I thing was fecking weird actually the whole vocal coach thing was weird also as he said there's no definitive accent usually u can tell where ppl r from roughly and ppl from the country have a thicker accent
aRe yOu bRiTiSh oR sOmEtHiNg
Sean please wath the first movie with us on stream🙏🏻😂😂😂
I'm gonna be honest with you, I thought I had pretty good speech recognition in English for a foreigner, I always watch movies without subtitles and understand everything, but then I came across Joseph Gilgun in _Misfits_ and _Preacher_ and was forced to turn on subs
How do you say BAIS
this video single-handedly made me miss my semester abroad in Ireland
The young offenders, dunno really me thinks gud
You should look up videos of the deep South in the USA. No one understands them.
"That's what we do in Ireland, by the way, just hang out in fields and run around with our arms out in the middle of cattle."  Um, isn't there an older video of Sean running through a field with his arms out, yelling "I love nature?"  (Granted he is holding a camera in one hand)
Hi     ⁿ⁰
Jack made me sad because I was actually drinking milk when he said drink milk b**ch.
it's funny how im russian but i understood enough of what that shepherd was saying to... well, to understand
I know you were trying to be nice about that lady but she sucks at an Irish accent.
News reporter: irish accent Farmer: ╎ ꖎ𝙹ᓭℸ ̣  ᒲ|| ⎓⚍ᓵꖌ╎リ ᓭ⍑ᒷᒷ!¡ ∴⍑|| ᒲ⚍ᓭℸ ̣  ⊣𝙹↸ ↸𝙹 ℸ ̣ ⍑╎ᓭ ℸ ̣ 𝙹 ᒲᒷ
This is Sean’s revenge on us for making fun of his colorblindness.
I could understand it the second time. But goodness I thought my audio fucked up for a second 😂😂
What Jack failed to mention was that irish men was also voted the ugliest in the world, again. For a stand-up bit with Dyland Moran from nine years ago check out /watch?v=itwfSrSeb64&t=8m58s
I thought I had pieced together pretty well what he was saying but I was waaayyy off 😂
That guy who lost his sheep is what French teachers play for oral exams istg
Honestly for the guy who lost his sheep, Jack could’ve just been making up whatever the heck he wanted and we would have no idea
The Christofer walken impression tho
dam, this jacksepticeye fella should take up irish classes! i feel like he can pass it with flying colours! especially since he already knew a bit of it...
I’m Irish but I have no accent. I don’t know if I should be happy I don’t because I might have ended up with an accent hard yo understand but eh. I’m fine       And I’m Italian as well so “y u booly me”
Wait even he can’t understand impossible
jack react to irish mike
The look on jacks face at 10:48-10:55 is priceless
Brad Pitt was made to sound like that just to confuse people just for the shock value.
My mum says Christopher sounds Yorkshire 😂
Seán, the only reason the Irish accent is #1 is because you exist.
The Irish accent was voted sexiest in the world huh? I knew I wasn’t alone in thinking that
That was the greatest, thank you! LMAO
Bhí mo chara ag labhairt Gaeilge
Dood talks about sheep mine as well talk villager language from minecraft
Just to make everyone aware, the Facts channel was run by a twat who tried to cheat the staff and performers. The staff left and formed a new channel called the Try Channel. Also they did once "react to Jacksepticeye" when they were still at Facts. Met a bunch of them, lovely people and comedians.
We need Sean on young offenders or Derry girls
I really enjoyed this video. I personally love the Irish accent and I also enjoy the differences per province. It's the same, but different. I hope you do more of this kind of thing.
accent so heavy sounds like a different language.
Sean is from the south of Ireland and I’m from the north there is a difference between accents
I feel really bag for anyone that needs subtitles, IMAGINE the subtitles in this
factual
HE HAD A ROCK TIED TO HIS NECK. I laughed wayyy too hard from that
Ah Christopher walken.. when a New Yorker tries be Irish. lol. Now I’ve heard it all. 😂
I tried to learn Irish in Duolingo but I got bored so I tried something else BTW Im a Filipino  and failed Irish... I need to learn the accent first before continuing the lesson....
Oh man, do I love accents overall
Dia duit! Conas atá tú? An bhfuil tú ábalta Caint as Gaeilge? Chuir Caca Milis  sa físeán Seán le do thoil. Go raibh míle ;)
Indeed some Irish people could have a problem understanding that- idk wtf he said- I’m Irish-u no sound like that
Oh yeah Sean well I do drink MILK beat that
see if i try to do an irish accent i end up doing a british one and i’m not even good at that
i love and hate myself for understand all these...god bless my parents
Sean you should have reacted to Norman reedus’s Irish accent in the boondock saints
His regular speaking voice get waaaaay more Irish when he's reaction to Irish people/accents
I like the people at Facts, but the channel Try is way better. Because they were able to split off of Facts, make their own content, and run the show themselves.
6:00 Sean, pls, I'm begging you. Tell me he's speaking a different language, I can't understand a single word
I live in Ireland and, an Irish accent changes in every county
I was drinking milk when he said drink more milk
Half the time I'm trying to understand what there saying
We need a Down the Irish accent hole  series
As a Wisconsinite, I feel the same way whenever someone tries to do a North-Midwestern accent.... dontcha knowh?
pin me u won't COWARD
Im irish
20:08 "Oh, you're such a fierce Gaul!" XD
Sometimes the accent sounds like swedish 😅
I'm sorry but how the fuck are Scottish accents sexy! We sound shite, and like a drooling drunk half the time... wait.. I think there's a pattern emerging ...
i just want you to make fun of the finnish accent cause it's SO BAD
Jack: im not turned on by the Irish accent  Sean: WHAAAT me: ohhh yessss
I studied abroad in Ireland a little more than 3 years ago. I went to get food at a Subway (I can't remember where I was because we went everywhere, but I believe it was Dublin). Anyway, the employees got a big kick out of the way I said "ranch". 😂   I'd go back in a heartbeat. It was the best experience of my life.
Fuck Ballyhaunis caught me completely off guard dont think you will be doing much rowing down there tho
I'm danish, and I'm telling you some of those thick Irish accents sound a lot like Northern swedish
I love that Kevin and Jack have found the Irish farmer video. Golden.
Irish man gatekeeping his accent for half an hour straight
I'm so proud of myself, I could understand everything but that sheep video, only a couple sentences on that one. The only Irish I've got in me is my ancestry, they moved from Ireland to the Americas. I absolutely love Irish anything, I really wanna go someday!
This was fun
i’m irish and that farmer was very hard to understand lmao
these guys sounds EXTREMELY German to me
The farmer reminded me of when my po pó would try to talk to me in Cantonese and I would have no idea what she was saying
Jacksepticeye would be the perfect voice for the Lucky charms Mascot Change my mind
14:16 SO MOVE BACK
I caught like half of this
Irish Accent:  Whale Oil Beef Hooked.
* flashbacks to 2 men 200 accents *
That voice coach with the I's made me hella uncomfortable
Christopher Walken as an  Irishman makes as much sense as Sean Connery as a Spaniard or Russian. LoL
lol
I’m subscribing to other channels who like this. 😎 I am slowly growing my channel as well. 👍
I can barely understand them and I'm in the middle of no where in the countryside where ppls accents are rlly heavy also jack u barely have an accent
Ya gotta check out da tick Newfoundland accent!
Ive been sat here saying MUR(mirror) for longer than I should admit
God I love Snatch so much
I have very little Irish in me
The funny thing is i am danish and It weren't that bad as i understood everything except for those two sheep farmers those were hard to understand, got a few words though.
Im irish and this video was so funny no one can do an Irish accent unless your irish end of story but the best accent is the connamara accent its from the west of galway best place to be without a doubt
I am not a hint of Irish, and I think the actors and actresses accents were weird.   Maybe because I’m watching this guy and shows with actual Irish people, but 🤷🏽‍♀️
Idk what it says about me and the fact I could understand a lot of it... I'm Scottish... XD
I feel like among us is taking away from our precious meme time.
(:
I'm going to be honest I really like Irish accent and I was trying to say some Irish accent as well but I was so bad at it 😆😆😆😆
this was so cute for some reason? Just seeing Jack reminisce and smile and laugh was just utterly wholesome.
I don't think I can even understand Jack anymore, and he doesn't even have an accent. What the... Also, I love it.
Jack going 'im fucken great at this" to the Irish accent tutorial actually killed me
Please for the love of god do a southern accent video picking out what people are saying. I’m a southern woman and I would absolutely die if you did. Ah 😭😂 also why could I understand some of these. My AncestryDNA Irish: 3% aye lass!
5:19 that guy is just 60 year old Jack.
the how to do an Irish accent has more likes and views than this, lets change that guys!!
The sheep man has such a thick accent it just sounds like he's speaking dutch.
there's actually a place in cork called ringoskiddy
Jack you need to watch young offenders cuz I didn’t understand almost half the words they say
Jack can I volunteer to subscribe for the rest of the 42%?
for a second I thought the farmer was just speaking straight Gaelic lol.
MOAAARR JECK!!
I do have a lil bit of Irish in me, and I talk really fast most of the time, and I tend to stutter and mumble too.
Jacks number 1
As an Irish person, I heavily relate to seans reaction to hearing that its an american lady doing the "how to do an Irish accent" video, 10:07.  Not slagging you Americans but you actually don't know shit(e) about the Irish accent, and it's so funny hearing ye try.
can sean speak gaelic????
Jack!!!!!! Watch derry girls on Netflix. Im sure you'll like it
Nothing beats a strong cork accent,  every time i visit my mates down there i just get confused and happy.
The sheep guy just sounds like any person on a listening comprehension 😔
Faarty five
Like when English or US people talk German and every German be like:??
Eventually we will need to reclassify heavy irish accents as new irish
That guy with the sheep reminded me of the world snake from God Of War 4  "he speaks in a dead tongue"
Ohh Jason statham fucking circle head
I was HOPING he'd react to these videos, aahhh!!!
8:15 I've heard this one before and I, a non-Irishman, thought it sounded like a fake sarcastic accent.
I myself am Irish so I can relate to this
the person from Kerry sounded like she was from Liverpool imo
The mad accent just sounds like gibberish😂😂
JACK PLEASE PLAY ORI AND THE WILL OF THE WISPS! THERE ARE SO MANY NEW ADDITIONS TO THE NEW GAME, AND THE COMBAT SYSTEM IS VERY REFINED AND JUST IN GENERAL ITS SUCH A BEAUTIFUL GAME AND I LOVE SEEING YOU PLAY AND YOUR OPINIONS ON EVERYTHING! PLEASE PUT IT ON YOUR LIST OF THINGS TO PLAY! LOVE YOU AND YOUR VIDEOS!!!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ LIKE SO HE SEES THIS! ORI FANS UNITE!!!
We get wild mountain thyme and oregano it tastes s”lightly different
Hahaha his face when she said OIL
FARTYFIVE LOL
:Could you say top of the morning :no Jack: Haha. Irish people don't say that. Me: your Irish and you say that in most of your videos
I saw a video of different bloopers from a series called Auntie's Bloomers, and one of the news clips was this old black and white news clip, and this Irishman was with his friends for a small protest strike about work, and he not only had an Irish accent, but he talked WAY too fast for anyone listening to understand! If I can, I'll try and find the clip!
Trying to understand Irish is like trying to read black metal logo’s
Irish Accent being played.  Jack being an Irishman : " I'm really good at it."
*sips irish tea* "Aight who wants the secret of irish accents"
The Olympic rowers weren’t hard to understand... not as bad as the farmer by far
HAhaahahah
jack there's an update on tabs, its called unit creator. you should check it out
The anchor from RTE sounds like Jack's early days.
I literally fucking cried laughing at this video, thank you so much Sean.
Take pewds with you to Ireland
Petition for an Assassin's Creed game in Ireland.
“Go back to bed, Drink more milk B”  We need that on a shirt
i really like Irish accents its so fun to listen to.
I'm not even Irish but this hilarious
Irish accents are quite similar to Newfoundland accents so I can actually understand a lot of this which is interesting
While watching this video I felt like back in the day when I didn't understand a word of English-
maybe I'm just desensitized to Jack's accent but I could really understand what most of the people were saying except for the sheep guy and honestly Jack doesn't even really sound Irish to me at this point
The guy that lost his sheep.. what  Sean said and what I heard oh wow xD
love it
Oh lordy. I needed the laugh today green bean:) i love the irish accent, i feel like sometimes there should be subtitles for it, but it's great:)
Video : no subtitles  Me hearing : potato potato potato potato potato potato potato potato
2:22 JacksepticGru
christoffer wolkin
I'm not sure if Wild Mountain Thyme is a disaster or marketing genius, they got every Irish person talking about it before its even released 😂😂
i went into it thinking "why the hell people think irish accent is sexy?" but then... 14:26...
every time i try to pull out an irish accent, i always end up with a scottish accent with a soft 'r' sound.  i realized my tongue wasn't designed for this.
Now, I want to see Irish accent vs Boston accent just to see who the most talented.
Whale oil beef hooked.
Seán have you seen the try channel? They posted a video compilation of people trying to do Irish accents and it is hilarious.
As a Scot, I sound very Irish with certain words; primarily 'cardigan,' and 'shortbread.' xx
ah yes the music of an irish accent:  perish song
"I wouldn't say I find irish accents sexy" Me: ARE YOU MAD?!
I'm only 3 minutes in but God I hope Norman Reedus is in this lol
So you telling me that Kevin, the 100% Irishman, couldn't understand the sheep man but Jack could?
I remember when I used to have an accent that heavy when I was little 💀💀
The sheep farmer said fortnite wha-?
so people from cork
Fun Fact about County Louth, it has a large Polish community (I am part of it) and not alot of us have an Irish accent but I so happen to be one of the few that do. I've lived in Ireland my whole life so i have a fairly strong accent but I am able to switch between accents without a problem.
“You’re great! Don’t change for anybody.” Lol for some reason now all I can think of is signing year books and HAGS! Lol
Jack can upload more often , you videos are great and I can't wait for them.
I LAUGHED THROUFH THIS ENTIRE VIDEO I LOVE IT 💀💀💀
Jack, your neck is getting apparently red, be careful bud
Hey jack my papa sadly passed away but he was from Cavan country and me personally my name is Cavan but he had a very strong accent and he would always try to make me laugh and I could only get the strong accents like cork
The video was amazing jack!
And here I was, thinking it's all about the "arr" while it's actually about the "oii".
No disrespect or anything but Irish is third sexiest accent your sources are wrong. 1st is Kiwi, 2nd is South African (Shout out to my South Africans), and 3rd is Irish.
"farty five sheep" 😂. I'm Scottish and it cracks me up when people try to to do our accent.  My dad's side of the family are southern Irish and my grandparents had the strongest accents ever. Even I had a hard time understanding understanding them 😆
Lol Sean i heard an Irish man say my name before. My name is Tabitha.
WTF is that one at  I live in Ireland and k don't hear anyone saying "oil do this"
0:20 Corpse with his American accent:  “Am I a joke to you?”
I'm from skibbereen!!!!!!!!
BY JESUS BAIS, HE DIDNT FECKING HERE YHE IRISH TALE   just go look up “An Irish Tale” lads you won’t be disappointed
I am fecking Irish and I can barely get it

I’ve never lived in Ireland but I have some dna and a bit of an accent somehow-
What about the Irish accent in sons of anarchy is that not real too?
jack is irish this video is prof just in case someone dosent know that
Which part of Ireland is jack from
I am Irish and I have been told have a really strong accent and that it is hard to understand so story time I was in America and I went to a lunch place and they told be that no one can understand me so I did not end up getting food that day😁👌
ur frostbit lad was class
13:29             *General Kenobi...*
That accent jack did of himself sounded like old cabin jack 😂
I'm lactose intolerant!!!
Your accent is great, not weird, just a good Irish accent 😊
*FROST BUTT* that's gr8 XD
Quite a beautiful accent.
The rower I could under stand clearly
When the ad closes the comments: The lion, the witch, and the audacity of this b**ch
My mans speaking German
Annunciate this sentence     ----->    "Whale Oil Beef Hooked"     Congrats! now you are irish.  When my american friends online tell me they are 1/16th irish and emphasise their heritage, saying they feel like they belong there and are really in touch with their familial background.  I have to politely tell them "Bitch, no ya fookin arent"
2:20 Jack just started doing Arnold!!😂
I'm so glad you made the comparison to American accents with the diversity of dialects throughout the country because like.... try to understand a thick Boston accent if you're not from Maryland. Try.
I LOVED THIS 🤣
Evelyn’s next video: “Listening to strong accents in all 57 languages I speak fluently”
Wow HEAVY ACCENT and no you don'tt sound like that jack
The worst thing is I watched that voice coach to sound like Jack
The girl that said kiss me I’m Irish who else was like ✋🏽 I’m in 🤣☠️
Irish tea is jack daniels
PeOpLe
I’m surprised but also not surprised, and impressed, that Jack could translate that sheep guy.
When they got to county corke I literally just hear dahi speaking to me
I'm Oirish, tuh be sure, tuh be sure. It's like Temple Bar in high season - as Irish as spaghetti.
American: Park Ireland: Park Trump Supporters: PORK! DID SOMEONE SAY PORK!? F*CK KOSHER!
I have the tiny Irish Accent and only use it when I’m PISSED
I’m not even Irish and I was cringing like crazy at her video
Watch Derry Girls on netflix for an amazing Irish accent experience!
While listening to the farmer one I was tripping because my ears felt broken
when u where talking about the word 'sweet' i found my selft lost in ur got damn eyes just staring without fkin knowing it untill u zoomed out the face cam again, thats never happened before... your eyes are very nice..
Jack sounded like grue from  despicable me when he did that rock tied to his neck part😂
Sure I’m Irish  I’m in my fecking kitchen having a slice of Brennan’s bread  Bout to have some avenmore and taking a shite
Love some UEC! ~Unintentionally Educational Content~
Worst pickup lines😂
Damn, Jack nailed the Irish accent very well. :o
I'm Irish and I have no clue what there saying
Hey! Jack I'm part Italian and French! I take offense to that!
Best accent in Ireland is the Sligo accent. Fucking class accent.  I still live in Ireland and no county sounds like that woman. No one unless your an owle Dub.   I live in Ulster in the county (not going to name my county for privacy reasons) on the border of the north and most people more northern of the county sound like they are from the north.
I have a slight Irish accent(very slight, sometimes I'll hear myself with an Irish accent, sometimes I won't), and it's only from watching Jack, and kind of "connecting" to my Irish heritage, but I love it
PLEASE DO MORE ACCENT REACTION THINGS IF YOU DO PLEASE DO NEW ZEALAN OR AUSTRALIA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
When your farty-five sheep have been stolen 😔
English with Irish accent sounds like Dutch.
1:43 am I the only one who heard "this sausage I love" lmao
My Grandad is from limerick, I love his accent.
Brad Pitt is doing a Traveller accent, specifically a UK/English Traveller.
Should react to the strongest Pittsburghese accents, takes a lot from Scots-Irish, PA German, Polish, Ukrainian, and Croatian. I think it's why more of us can understand some heavier accents, cause we can understand bits of it and all that you know?
I love listening to you and another Irish youtuber named TacticalPotato. He hates when the Warframe devs give things a "turty-tree point tree" stat.
Thank you for this lol what timing, I literally was trying to learn how to do an Irish accent yesterday.
Irish accents make English another language
yesss please give moreeeee MORE I sayyyy
It would be really cool if you started reacting to American accents! Some are really strange lol
You should check the movie Untouchable (1987) where Sean Connery was trying an Irish accent but he gave up and used some kind of scottish - american mix accent.
Talk like a pirate and you can be Irish
I was literally making a potatoe while watching this-
This makes me cringe....and I’m American.
The next time he browses YT he will only see news & shit.
This is SOOO funny as I was just wanting to get you to check out Mike on the YouTube channel That Chapter...his Irish accent is killer! Love that he teases himself about saying tree instead of three lol
Anyone wanna se him colab with Connor McGregor not sure what they’ll do but still
i moved away from Ireland (my birth place) 2 years ago and i never thought i would miss the accents so much
the thing that Sean said about Ireland having thousands of different accents also applies to England, *especially* the North. i cringe whenever people try doing a Yorkshire accent 😂
I'm American and I'm only like 30% Irish and I understood the farmer wtf
Sean, don't worry. We understand that just because you don't live in Ireland anymore doesn't mean you're not Irish.
I feel like the more I watched this, the easier it became to understand the some of the heavy accents. Just some.
why wasn't the video in my subscriptions section?! wtf
This was definitely entertaining while on my break. Thanks Jack!
KINDA SUS
Ah the good ol accent.........best is when Sean plays with the Irish Lads
Who else in class tryna not to laugh
... when your from Kerry and confused because you can understand the sheep farmer perfectly and no one else seems to be able to 🙊🙊😂😂😂
As a Southern American with a thick accent, this video had me rolling. I could partially understand some of the farmer. This video reminded me of my time in Scotland and how much I love the accents from that part of the world. I love how unique all of the dialects are. Just like how different the southern accents are
Dia duit jack im not irish im a polyglot áfach ach tá mo bhéim i bhfad níos measa ná mo chuid Éireannach ach tá an teanga go hálainn
I can barely understand what they're saying, but for some reason, I still want to hear them talk. Ah, the Irish: a great bunch 'a lads! XD
I almost fully understood the farmer! I fully understood what the schoolboy and the rowers were saying, surprisingly! I want a deeper accent than the very shallow and only slightly hinted one I already have. I want jack to teach me a deeper version of the accent I have.
Talking Irish is like talking as a ventriloquist, moving your mouth as little as possible lmao I love it
The scottish accent sounds like a drunk person "Yeh menn de fickn coows in de felds mann
It sounds like he's playing with the Irish Lads again
Drink some more blue wicked child
The guy with the sheep, I could barely understand him. Thanks for the translation lmao
He isnt playing among us nowadays or he would've protected sykunno
I might move into a house that the previous owners name is Sean O'Laughlin, I'm not joking and in the basement there's a 420 room 🤣
My sister was Irish
L is for lovers to love one another  A is for ass of which I like to eat U Is for ur the only one  for me G is for gamer the one I see H is for happy I always feel it   When you put it together what do you get what do you get what do you get   LAUGH!!!!!!!
Lmfao I love this his accent really does get stronger as the video goes on 🤣😂
lmao as another irish person im sitting here wheezing- they just sound like they are all drunk- like where all the words ramble into eachother
How about Nogla accent?
This video brings me joy. Appreciate the translation Jack. 💚
Bro no Irish accent is bad wtf. The ones you don't understand are from the West like Kerry. Come on man 🔥
This is absolutely my fave vid ive seen in a loooong time, loved it
Why did this video come out right when I’ve been practicing how to do an Irish accent for theater
You know what... We need this more!!!
I can’t be the only one who develops an Irish accent the more Sean’s accent comes out.
the point of brad pitt's irish accent is that you're not meant to understand it that's the j o k e
I mean, you have one generic accent for places yourself jack, how about you make some videos about it, I think that would be intersting for everyone
Petition to have accent Olympics
Would've loved to see how he feels about The Boondock Saints movies lol.
Hey Jack, I love your videos! I know that you aren’t much of a call of duty guy, but I would really love it if you played Black ops Cold War
Lads watch Father Ted and Mrs Browns Boys and you'll be grand  ~from some irish girl
sean was so aggresive with that intro
I **need** you to do a reaction to Boston accents now, pleeeeease. I think you’ll find a shocking amount of similarities
i dont understand why they dont just hire an irish person wtf ekdk
Farst!
I just woke up and this confused the living life out of me
Definitely hot fuzz vibes in this video man.
Jack: I am reviewing Irish accents because I am from Ireland.   Jack's lights: FRANCE!!!
Forgot to comment
i am so glad im irish so i can understand this
I like these video bout lrish I do joy it like lrish voice
Wild Mountain Thyme starring Tom Cruise as the Last Irishman. 🤣
I wanna live in Ireland....It's soo fuckin beautiful and calm
I love Irish accents. I’m American and our accent is so boring
next Sean  should do a American country ascent. I will judge I'm from Knox county in Knoxville TN
That irish farmer is the voice they use for an English listening test in school, honestly
Put this on 0.5 speed it sound like he is drunk
I remember when jack would hide his accent and I hated him, but now he's irish boyo
Now why didn't they just cast Saoirse Ronan for Wild Mountain Thyme?
Jack you should play games with irish fans (Now im not sayin I want to be in that video buttt......)
now i want to watch only irish news
I'm watching on my 4k monitor and I can SEE Jack's white hairs growin' in
In The aquaman movie he is supposedly talking icelandic. He doesnt he just babbles. Fookin disgrace
I loved every second of this video
So Sean didn't leave Ireland, he was exiled
.
Lmao the boy wasn’t hard to understand, I’m from south London and I understood it, nor was the rowers
jack when you play gone little nightmares 2?
That farmer when he spoke     ???????????
Am I tripping or is the Dublin accent.... really light?
*Talisian Gaffe has left the chat*
Christ, sure I was down in Skib with my uncle when quarantine was calming down and the water was fuckin freezing like, as yer man from the North said I wouldn't be long gettin "frostbit". Twas fuckin gorgeous tho, first time I'd been down there and it was fierce sunny too
The first video sounds more like Australian
Thank you for this
I- Is this how non-americans feel when trying to understand Texans-
Don't the edges of Jack's eyes look like Naruto in Sage mode?🤔
Jack you should play a game called Pikmin 3. It just got remastered on switch and I think it would be fun for you to play.
Craziest American accents are on the island of Tangier, Va. Sounds like an old English accent
The people who aren't Irish saying they understand the man who lost his sheep are definitely lying lmaoo
Brad pit wasn’t even saying anything he was just reading a dictionary
Irish rower: *inaudible Irish noises* Sean: What a legend
I’m sad he didn’t react to Sham from Killarney
Lol!! My family is from Bere Island off the coast of Cork and I want to say that my uncle is hard to understand, but I get him. idk.
That's how America is you can go to a state that's right next to it and they have different accents and by the way she's supposed to be a professional so you can make fun of her all day if she's getting it wrong
Man that sound more swedish then english to me
I wanna see Sean listen to deep southern accents I'm from Louisiana and can't understand some of these Cajuns
That was so hilarious omg I'd love to see some more accent or dialect videos
It's so weird, every time I watch videos about accents I always absorb them and can only say cirtain words
I just wanna say in my opinion Scottish is even harder to understand.
Please, for the love of God, do the Artemis Fowl Movie next. Its AWFUL!
Keep it in the blindfold Jeff
omg this was so much fun. i've been watching you vids so long i don't even fully register your accent anymore. so hearing all the other Irish accents was really fun
Plllllllllllllease jack replay night in the woods Like if you think so too
i feel like i could talk like any mix of these accents and it would be correct
Alternative title: Un-irish irish man judges un irish people's irish voices for being Un-irish
but i and people from the country side say shtone or buildin shite
I understand all of it without any problem other than the sheep farmer. 😂I'm Irish / German, unfortunately born in the US. ;p
Irish people just speak cursive
Irish is going to become a new language at this rate
jack if u see this can you tell me how to make it as good as a youtuber like you
You should react to and criticize the Irish accents in The Boondock Saints. If you haven’t seen it, it’s one of Norman Reedus’s best roles before he got super famous in The Walking Dead.
The heavy irish accent sound like he’s speaking in tongues
When your accent can’t even be understood by Sean you have no hope in life.
The farmer sound like Turkish more than. Irish
E
This video should be called “Irish accent are awesome”
What's the background music at 7:44?
The loud accent was done too clear
It's like when Hollywood does one of two English accents despite how there are so many bloody accents.
Fastest accent I ever heard is Ardoyne, North Belfast.
It's weird depending on what I say, sometimes it'll sound like an irish accent, my mom's side is from, I think southern ireland, so the "ar"s is mainly where you hear it. Rarely you'll hear it in "u"s, but only if your looking for it. My mom says you can't hear it in her voice anymore, but I still hear it sometimes XD
Love em or hate em they spittin straight gibberish!
Wow I wanna go to “stab city” 😂
“He’s speaking the language of the gods!”
I like it how respects his country like he loves his country like shit
my god i just love cracking jokes at portuguese accents... on my own even... cause for some reason the rest of the country thinks we are always pissed off and being rude all the time.
I love irish accent, sounds cool, smart, dumb and loud at the same time
What's a feerted gouel?
I ACTUALLY UNDERSTOOD WHAT SEAN WAS SAYING A LITTLE BIT (The farmer not our Irish boy I obviously understand him 🤣☠️)
Why does no one like American accents? I feel unappreciated...
You should really react to the newfoundland people’s accents, it’s like an irishman got lost in the woods and ran over by a bison
This wos fon
How About Canada? (English Canda)
0:50 I’m not shitting you when Jack was about to list the cast numbers for Wolf Mountain Thyme my first thought was Emily Dickenson for whatever reason and then he said Emily Blunt and I was like 👁👁              👄
Kinda wonder what happen when Jack, Dathi, Ken, Brian spoke their unique Irish(Gaelic) language... Damn
aww irish people have to deal with people badly imitating their accent    ........"laughs in Scottish"
This is literally my Aunt speaking.
Wow . I love your voice but I will admit I couldn't understand all of them accents. I would love to visit Ireland some day in the future.  Then Norway to visit where my Viking blood comes from
this is so weird.. like, from what i get, most Irish people can understand eachother's dialects? I'm used to Italy where every 10 minutes you travel by car you get a new dialect, close to the last one maybe, but still different. People from the north don't understand the people from the center or the south's dialects and viceversa, mainly, every region has its own dialect (generally speaking, since in reality, every single town has something that changes from the main dialect).
Fsssity five
Is that still english?
Why did I take so much joy in Sean saying “Eat Shit France”?
Lad your man from “guide to the Irish accent” was the best
I love the accent
Loved the video thanks for the laughs
Seán, You have the best Irish accent!  I want to hear you talking for real in your Irish accent. Like read a short story or do a video in just your Irish accent.  Thanks. Love ya!
“The music of the Irish accent” If the Irish accent is music, it’s 100 gecs
lmao, im from the south of ireland and i can barely inderstand the farmer😂
I'm from cark ant teres a ting ar too about te accent farst Yar usually missen a few wards ar replacin em wit vales ar tee's
Am I d only one who understood everything
My french teacher told us to watch that trailer for the mountain one because of how bad the accents are I'm not even irish myself and that accent still feels wrong
The girl at 17:04 is beautiful!
Damn, I wonder where jack is from? My bet is Cork
Christopher Walken sometimes sounds like he’s from Boston when he tried to do a Irish accent.
Anybody else read the title and think straight to the Unus Annus vid where they called Sean while trying out an irish accent?
Being Irish and trying to listen to your one teach people is hilarious
Kevin's video on the matter was one of the most hularious videos ever, so I'm expecting much from this.
It's like the Boomhauers Of Ireland.
Me, a non native English speaker: ¿¿¿¿¿
"He didn't sound like he was off with the fairies"   D-don't all Irish accents sound like that.... Just the people I know...? Ok.
English is English
I’m not Irish but I say mirror like that too😂 mirrrrrr
When I try to do an Irish accent I sound like Fat Bastard, and he's scottish.
JACK WHY DID YOU STOP THE OUTER WILDS SERIES?
Ask Corpse to do an Irish accent on the next among us stream!!
It's like his trying to speak to me, I know it
I'm from limerick let's ģoooooooooooooooooooo lads
I live in irlind and it is dark  Loish
Translation Well bah = hello friend Sta craic = what's up Tree = 3 Póg mo thóin = kiss me
Why is everyone talking in enchant table
Where's scp
Living in Ireland is the best
I liked the part where he spoke wuth an Irish Accent
great vid, would love to see a series of jack going to different places in Ireland after the rona is over
Ye have to listen to the northern accent hai especially the cavan accent 😂
I love a good irish stereotype film🇮🇪
He knows his accent is almost non existent 😂
Watch "Snatch" again, you won't regret it.
Play MONSTRUM
My family said to me imma third irish and this was interesting to see
I will never tire of these videos! It's always interesting to see someone from a specific area react to others doing their accents. Also the comments are just gold lmao.
Is it bad that i understand 90% of this How irish am I?
I don’t care what anyone else says, no one here in Ireland sounds like Emily Blunt’s attempt of an Irish accent 😂😂
I adore the Irish Accent. My Gran's family is from Belfast. My Great Gran had a lovely accent, however for years we weren't sure if she was calling my then boyfriend Brian, or is actually name Ryan. All my Gran's siblings still have strong Irish accents while my Gran had lost hers...unless she's angry...if you hear the Irish accent return you run!!
I have a couple of Irish friends and their names are Ruby and Payge and I'm in love with their accents and they love my wicked one.
the kerry man i understud every thing but i know it therms like round arse on that because i am a farmer
xD
0:09 do you mean Ethan? 😂
Ugh that high pitch shit made me laugh way to damn hard. Need to find that video 😂
I am Irish and I am cringing so hard
My music teacher can do so many accents he’s like super funny too sooooo he nailed the Irish accent
Fuck..I didn't even know, this was posted just an hour ago. I used to ignore Jack's videos , but I'm happy now, bcos, I can binge them.
8:08 i can tell this is some one from northern ireland don't ask how i know lol 😂
I love Ireland. Visited Dublin last year and now I really want to go to Cork. Also, Kilkenny looks very beautiful.   Just overall kind people w good humor, nice food & beautiful nature.   Hugs from The Netherlands ❤
Jack's triggered about fake Irish, while I am about the horse smacking Please, don't smack horses. They actually have thinner skin than humans and more nerve endings.
I love when Jack goes down rabbit holes or story/rp videos
At points Pitt kinda sounded more northern than southern. Its so funny being northern Irish watching a true Irish man reacting to Americans tryna sound irish
Me: listening to irish accent in every clip of the video. Sean: says that half of them not even close. Also me: WAD' TE FOCK 🗿🗿🗿
I looked and there is 1 person that is Irish in wild mountain thym
Out of what the farmer said I got “beautiful morning” and “mountain” sooooo
0:37......what's sad about this is I'm sitting in bed drinking milk rn
I don’t remember any woman coming from me
The man that lost his sheep so reminds me of Boomhauer from king of the hill if he was Irish!
I understood about 10% of this video
Seán this was amazing. Please do more of this shit🤣❤️❤️ you are so wonderful and fantastic and the irish accent is the best.
14:37 smooth
The "Pikey" accent in Snatch isn't Irish. Brad imitated a strong Newfoundlander accent mixed with more Irish than normal (Newfie accents are a mix of French, English and Irish) to pull it off.
Clearly we need more games with the lads!
Jack's Moustache looks like Yosemite Sam.
The awkward moment when Sean does a better impression of Christopher Walken then Christopher Walker does of an Irish person 😂
I like the subtle increase of your accent as the video goes on, like a subtle flex lmao
So I got to the point where the American (I assume American anyways) woman was going to teach us how to do an Irish accent. And THAT is when I started to just instantly cringe in my chair before she even got to the accent lesson itself. All I can say is....I'm sorry from all of us Americans. We have no excuse. We just tend to suck at non-American accents.
Me who prided myself on becoming bilingual all on my own :   who the fuck is english? Who is she?
My friend’s dad has a thick Dutch accent, so Irish isn’t that hard to understand.
I want to come to Ireland and be blissfully confused
Scottish accent is very similar. Like you say you only have to travel outside your town and accents can swing so much.
Brad Pitt in snatch is playing a gypsy Irishman and hes talks like that to trick you into things because you dont full understand them.
The man with the sheep is not speaking English and no one can convince me otherwise
I feel like @jacksepticeye needs to hear the Newfoundland accent
I DARE YOU TO PUT AUTO-GENERATED SUBTITLES ON THE SHEEP GUY. LET'S SEE WHAT THE SUBTITLES SAY
Only thing I understood  Bright
I have planned to move to Ireland to study the accent in order to get one myself.
The reason Hollywood didn't do the smart thing and hire Irish actors is that they wanted to get Americans to see the movie by using famous American names. By casting people that the American public is already familiar with people will be more likely to see just to see the celebrity  (in Hollywoods pov). It's the same reason why so many animated movies include celebrity actors instead of voice actors, to appeal to the adults who see the names and go "I know this guy" and watch it with their kids. They do this just for celebrity endorsement (marketing) over accuracy.
I can understand about 1/4th of what that farmer is saying...
Some accents are so strong they might as well be speaking another language
How to learn an Irish accent: subscribe to Sean's channel, watch daily. Also, it's a shame you were never on Craig Ferguson's show.
I wonder what the captions look like for that mad lad of a farmer lmao
Ahh you should check out the Try Channel! The people who made facts, that’s their new channel ^-^
The weird part is that after 10 minutes in the video I started understanding the Irish
Oh you’re Irish? Name every Jacksepticeye video.
ok ok ok, who the fuck put swedish accent in #7?? swedish accents are awful, and I can say that cause I'm swedish
Weird, by the end of the video I started to understand those thick accents :p Also, if you wanna learn a language or an accent, ALWAYS learn from a native speaker.
To quote Baldie's Basics in Education and Learning, "I HEAR IRISH THAT BAD"
The accent of that movie just sounds like Scottish or a disappointed irish mammy
🔔🔔 DING DING DING!!!!!!! Irish noises!!!!🔔🔔
Irish accents are far to powerful for the world that many cannot master the art those who do master the art becoming beings the world can understand
Have u heard some South Africans speak Afrikaans, some sound like motorbikes
Jacksepticeye I am 50% Irish does that count as being Irish
that horse be like "Wtf bro"
Jack, you think Irish are difficult to understand you should check out southern US citizens with them thick country accents, you'd be hard pressed to understand a word as well! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Irish people and Colombian people have some really weird things in common. I was surprised to hear that irish people say "your one" because in some parts of the Caribbean coast of Colombia people refer to others the same way (La tuya/el tuyo= your one). But obviously not every Colombian says this.
This was fun
At this point it should be it's own language
I thought Australian accent was the most sexy in the world- welp
lol the girl in how to do an irish accent not irish so she better stop talkin XD
Its very low but... does anyone hear music in the background of jack's video? its very faint. Edit: nvm in other parts its not as faint lol
The THICCCEST accent is CLEARLY the greastest
I have never been so confused in my life. I might be able to understand calculus vs the Irish accent
That farmer is just Irish Boomhower
i'm so glad this came out on my birthday, it's fucking delightful🤣
I have to admit i never notice his accent until i saw the gameplay with his irish friends.
One time, while working in a restaurant, I had a couple ladies ask what part of Ireland I am from. Now, I've lived 100% of my life in the United States, and my Great-Grandfather was born in Dublin for my closest to being from there. I apparently have a very subtle "Irish" hint when I talk according to them, but unless I'm consciously trying to do that "Lucky Charms Irish" accent, I honestly do not hear it.  Regardless, the ladies refused to believe I wasn't actually from Ireland and they referred me to as the Irish Lad the rest of their visit.  It was weird, man.
The farmer sounds like Princess Merida speaking on Wreck It Ralph 2.  🤣
As someone who moved away from my home country I feel the mood in this video. Home is home no matter where you go.
I would so watch a second video of this
Only one so far hard to understand was the farmer. The rest I understood at least 90% of what they were saying.
Brad pitt in Snatch is playing as an Irish Gypsy, so hes meant to be kinda difficult to understand. For an american, he did a good job haha, nice vid jack keep it up
This was super awesome thank you thank you thank you! I started dying laughing with the "vowel bender" comment. Okay Aang.... True story, I always loved the Irish accents I have heard since I was 4, that's when my grandfather told me his family was from Ireland. Being smack dab in the mid west USA I rarely hear any but when I do I am smiling ear to ear every single time. I recently found out my mom's side of the family is super Scottish........................... idk what to do with that but I have started studying up on my heritage recently so this video was so amazing. Thanks!! <3
Damn this is making me miss both Ireland and Scotland, I need to go back sometime soon!
Can you react to sgt ducky's guieds to Ireland, you might need to censor and cut out parts.
*Ireland in a nutshell* "Well man any craic with ya" *Drives 15 minutes down the road*   "Wellll,fefnioenfienfje"
Even as an Irish person myself I could not understand that farmer for the life of me!
*Unus Annus flashbacks* RIP
Brad Pitts' character from Snatch.  The Farmer from Hot Fuzz.  The super irish son from Brave.  Plenty of good candidates in films there :P  I swear, there are a LOT of irish and glaswegians that are practically impossible to understand, even other irish and glaswegians.
*He had a rock tied to his neck*
As an Irish girl from Limerick, this was hilarious. Irish accents are brilliant
I love them all. When you get playing with the Irish lads I love hearing them cone out.
Look at this graph 📊
Jack AKA google traduction
is spar a big thing in ireland then? i love the place but i never thought of it as a chain, i always thought it was just a shop on its own
they sound like their from meath or something
Did that guy not say there were 45 sheep missing?
I understand the farmer but its not easy lmao!.
13:29 GENERAL KENOBI
We northern Dubliners speak very fast
It's been a while since I have watched your vids I got scared off when you did last of us 2 cause I wanted to play
I feel like the more I hear it, my pistons in my brain fire and I’m starting to understand it better
What's your opinion on a Waterford accent? Mines isn't that strong but by the god the way some of the lads and girls speak is a hilarious
I feel you Jack. I'm from South Africa and when ever there is a South African character they choose a famous person who has the worst accent in the world. Like seriously?
I’m weirdly enough happy about this educating video about the different Irish accents. If you want to make more videos like this or about Ireland in general, I will be there to watch!
6:30 Jack could have said anything and was would have be leaves him lmao
Really expected some Peaky blinders thing in the video  But still great work   *Aour lowvly fowkin potato*   Luv u
15 seconds in: yep, I remember that unus annus video 😂
I'm Irish but.. My accent isn't there..I need to move to Ireland.. Help..
Irish accents are just great
Can you teach some Gaelic words???
You should play the marvel avengers game
Legend has it, their vocal cords are really just long potato fries
Irish accents are the best especially for puns
Sean should play Cold War Campaign so we can show him the true feeling of confusion
what happens if i'm irish-italian?
I'm from Liverpool and this was odd cause alot of the "irish" accents people try to do sound like a very strong English accent sometimes ngl
My favorite accent starts at 0:01 there's just something about it that is very intriguing
The final Irish boss
Scup the irish !! Hi from Louth in Ireland 😂 and that movie that is coming out is soooooo cringy!!!!why cant they just hire irish actors! And why does Hollywood think we all sound like fucking  leprechauns 😂🙈
8:30 that guy looks like buzz from home alone
Shave the beard and bring back the hat for a week
I really like jack's accent. Here is a vote ✌
French ? The fourth most sexiest accent in the world ? Really 😂😂 it’s joke for me because I’m French and.....I think it's very far from being a sexy accent 😅😂🤣
There is NO WAY that farmer was still speaking English
I have to say, any Irish accent sounds soooo much like an eastern Canadian accent, the reeeeeal east coasters like Nova Scotia, and just like Irish, sometimes their accents are so thick you can't understand them
Jack! I love your videos and I was watching a tik tok where someone drew you as Present mic and as they said "I'm drawing one loud bean and another loud bean" and whenever you say "Yeeah!" I get the image in my head
1:59 didn't realize smeagol was irish
top o' the 7:32 PM to ye
mmy friend youtube dyson_2Fa
Every accent was interesting in that they all sound completely ridiculous. So lovely
😳..... I understood most of that...!😧 Its mostly the sentence structure that gets me😅
As a person from Wicklow I’m offended we’re not represented yer man is not including us!! Hahah lol
is it just me or jack wares make up on his eyes
AHhahhahah! I get the same reaction as Jack when people states that swedish accent sounds musical as well xD And also... Why is the swedish accent #7 on that count-down in the beginning? It sounds friggen wuzzy if you'd ask me as a swede. :P
Jack: "Is this how it sounds when I talk in my videos?" No, definitely no.
Sean makes me think Ryan Tubridy
6:00 I know why they stole from him  They didn’t think he would be able to tell anyone about it. Ha
I've watched that Irish farmer video like a dozen times over the last few years but my understanding of what he's saying ranges from 60% to 80% on any given day.
I love making fun  of my cousins from new jersey (i'm from Georgia)
brad pit was not fuckin close it started northern and ended downsyndrome
If you can’t understand their Irish accent then it’s a true Irish accent
I love linguistics and the Irish accents are so interesting to listen to, very melodic and bouncy. In Sask, Canada, we had a very high Scottish and Irish population along with German, Ukraine and First Nations which created a very interesting accent. It's a mishmash of a bunch of things but I think the main ones I hear in our accent are celtic, french and Cree.
As a Kerry person I’ll admit sometimes I say stuff and pause, realising that what I said might not be understandable whatsoever
an Cabhán
Your accent is always the greatest, Sean!
Ik Sean is Irish but I still find it impressive he can explain the farmers accent
Wut...
Beannachtaí mo chomh-iriseoirí. Cosúil má thuigeann tú!
Based on this video I think my hairdresser might be from Cork because she sounds exactly like the girl from Cork
After watching Sean for years, I have adapted his way of saying car and my cousin always laughs at me. I enjoy saying it the Irish way.

me: an irish woman  also me when the sheep man speaks: tf is he saying
Personally I live for scottish accents
"Try and say the word 'mirror' in an Irish accent. It's just M-I and then 15 Rs." It's not just Ireland lol. I'm Scottish and I pretty much say 'mirr'r' as well, and whenever I've heard Americans say it it sounds like 'meer' (may not be the case for all American accents, just the ones I've heard). Also, on the topic of Irish people saying Oir-land according to that accent coach (don't worry, they often get the Scots wrong too), I've also realised that if I say Ireland without thinking about it, it usually comes out as "Arland" for some reason 🤷‍♀️ lmao
I kinda really want Jack to play Fallout 4 to react to the over the top Irish pit fighter's accent.
Even Christopher Walken does a bad Christopher Walken impression.
I’m not Irish, but I can somewhat relate, since there are many different American accents, just like there are many different Irish accents
I'm Irish and i still cant understand that guy
Hey I'm french! Who cares? No one.
okay, hold the hell on for a second. I understand that all accents usually have a SUPER heavy "version" of itself but DEAR LORD. some of them might as well have been talking in a different language at that point. NOT ONLY do we have to try and decipher what they're saying but we ALSO need to try and just understand their figures of speech
This is hilarious
Im American and I can understand them😳
I’m from Kerry and couldn’t understand mikey
I think corpse can change that
forget the accent... irish spelling hehe it's got way too many vowels for anyone to understand,   even my Scottish friends can't deal. no wonder people think Irelands some fairy tale land
Could you please look at "wolfwalker" it's an Irish folklore animation film
You should play Untitled Geese Game (Untitled Goose Game Co-Op)
did anyone see jacks white hair at the sides
Omg best video ever. From Galway funniest video bc some of the accents where so bad and some where good
That first one he showed just sounded like an english accent
How can you understand that old man lmaooo it sounds like gibberish
This video is stupidly funny.
This makes Jack’s voice sound clearer and easier to understand
Kildare people don't have t in water or what it's wha waer
All I got from the How to speak Irish video was "Say Oil-land and your golden" and I freaking love it!
You almost have 26million subs jack! Very happy! Iv been watching you sence 5k subs and you inspired me that anyone can do it as long as they tried much love man
You should watch how to speak Dublin by foil arms and hog
almost everyone that watched this video liked it
Idk jack's accent seems normal to me? Cause i remember me watching jack for the first time i thought "woah he sounds weird". Its either his accent changed bit by bit or i just got used to his accent.
Nobody:   Jack:TOP OF MORNING TO YAH LADS
I heard sheep 45 and London that’s what I got from that
Jack in the title acts like an irish pro but moved away long ago
15:36 that church is down in cobh
Why does this loud irish man have only 25 mil subscribers, i'm losing me brain!
I’m just disappointed you didn’t get to the Donegal accent. MORE OF THIS PLEASE!!
You know he's a true irishman when even in an interview he opens up with "What's the crack?"
Love your videos keep up the good work
Lmao the translation he did from that guy 😄❤😂 Oof the ppl talking to each other with the blindfolds .. sploosh
When he started translating i lost my shit XD
Wa County are ya from
Jack i think you should play dying light again
I love the Irish accent.  I have a lot of Irish family, I love getting to go over there and visit them (obviously can't happen right now).
I want jack to react to Scottish twitter next.
The worst thing is Walkens accent is still better than the actual Irish lads accent 😂😂
I started watching seán about 6 months ago and when I heard his voice I thought it sounded so different and interesting, but now when I hear him or any Irish accent it sounds normal and doesent stand out. My ears have adapted
The best part about Irish accents is that they say forty like “farty” and it’s just hilarious
Do Welsh next we are so weird with our accents some times
Never clicked so slow— Wait, that’s not right...
6:34 "I feel like that scene in Hotfuzz" I had a customer that sounded just like that. A work colleague asked his Daughter what his accent was, as she couldn't work it out. The Daughter replied said that his voice went like that after his stroke. My colleague went white as a sheet after that.
Hi Shawn mcclockin
I couldn’t differentiate between actual speech and just mumbling random stuff like the voices in my head, thank you Sean for somehow being able to understand what these people are saying
HA! Irish people
that's proper offensive
I have a Scottish accent ;-;
God damn these videos make me wish I was Irish
Is it me or is the Irish farmer talking gibberish and somehow jack is translating it in to English....
That sheep man is speaking in reverse
I have met many kinds of people with variations of so many accents but by far, the irish accent and people are the most delightful company
My favorite was the man who lost the sheep, such a fun accent
how do you even understand it I am just laughing
The best irish accent is every one You will never change my mind
Please do other celtic accents like South Wales more specifically Swansea vs Neath and up to North Wales which is vastly different then up to Scotland which I don't know too much about.
Irish i could understand them.... :)
Thank God Sean was there to translate because it was definitely needed. I can usually understand most Northern English, Scottish, and Irish accents but those farmers were DIFFICULT lol
This video was actually incredible
Does no one else think there was a missed opportunity to smash cut to 'I LOVE NATURE!!!!!'
95 percent of the people in Ireland can hold a big conversation in English
Wait, Emily Blunt is one of your favourite actresses? Really?? Why? Her films are dreadful.
I could understand Mr. Griffin. I just had to replay it a few times. But I only caught bits and pieces of what the first farmer said.
literally like dhdhd I'm from Cork but everyone has different accents, not just counties but every town has their own strong accent it's nice actually irish accents are lovely
I could only understand "Sheep"
I want Séan to react to Matt Mercer's "Irish" accent from recent episodes of Critical Role
Jackie boy man why u leaving out the olde Donegal accent. Find it very offense. Also not even I can understand the kerry boi.  Hup Donegal.
As a Scot, I feel this video in ma soul
Ah!!!! The frostbite guy! I met this guy in real life! Go and watch his song!
oh my god i'm crying this is hilarious!!! i love the accent please do more!
The ireland content is the best content
Me drinking my milk when jack yells at me calling me a bitch for drinking it XD
My dads from kerry but his accent  doesn't get as heavy as the first one lmao Mum on the other hand is from litrím so they have a pretty different vibe 😂   It's videos like these that make me sad I don't have one (my uncle tells me to come back and 'get' my accent tho lmfao ironically I have to put one on anyway coz he can't understand me across the phone 😂)
0:07  example: 1 man 100 accents  For those of you who know... good on ya
5:16         SOOOOOO thats how you spell seán's name
He's missing a few U's... A's, E's and whole bunch of other letter.
I didn't understand A SINGLE WORD THE FARMER SAID AAAAH
Cork is the Essex of Ireland, the accents sound similar
jack i have a question, how do you move your tongue  like you irish people mine cant do backflips
I'm becoming a weeb for Ireland.
You know some of the people who were harder to understand sound a lot like thick Newfoundland accents.
irish accent is like swedish but no
I wonder what Shawn thinks of Newfoundland accents lol
That schoolboy looks 40
arabic language cry in the corner
Watching Jacksepticeye helped me  learn English. Fast forward two years: I don’t understand a word they’re saying. 🤣🤣
I honestly couldn't tell you which accent came from what county, even after watching the video. I feel like we need to review for the quiz at the end of the week as a group
Jack really nailing these Irish accents like he's from Ireland lmaooo
Jack should do a  irish acent srry im kronk
My mom when I was growing up... "Jaysis, Mary, an oly saint Jhoseph" Something like that anyway...
We have ruined syllables.
He wasn't doin an Irish accent in snatch
The fact that Sean was sincerely translating. TRANSLATING. Blows my mind. Like how? What power do you hold Sean.
This video is a pawt o goooold
this is a glorious video, cause Irish accents.
Ah lad she fecking English for the love of god
We need more of this asap, you can take a 5 min walk and come across a different accent over here
If kathy bates' awful attempt at an Irish accent in American horror story  isn't in this video I will be very surprised
Lol I live in longford in Ireland and there is no irish accent
i love this video
Me: watches video Me after video, watching someone speak normally: Whath the heck are they saying?!
Jacksepticeye being irish is the best thing i have ever seen in the entire history of the entire world
The Dutch accent is my favourite 😁
“Oskskmsaososm” - An Irishman
I need leprechaun  And a pot of gold (ps i am not racist)
Brad Pitt wasnt just playing an Irish person though. It was Irish traveller specific.
Aw no boondock saints
Sean Mac An Cheese
"I'm a vowel bender" 🤣🤣🤣 this made me laugh so hard 😂
huh Am i the only one having a hard time understanding Seán?
Me working in a German supermarket Guy walks in speaks in English and I immediately think woa what a sexy accent so I asked him where he's from...  Turns out he was from Ireland.
To my great surprise I understood the gist of what the farmers were saying BEFORE Jack translated it. English is my 3rd language.
You should do other vids on different accents, like American accents from different states, southern, French, British, Russian whatever ya find lol
Honestly it's so true that every town has a different accent. U can go 5 mins down the road and it's like your in a different country altogether.
Please do more Irish videos!:)) and as an Irish person myself, the hardest accent to understand is the Kerry one. And yer wan at the end wasn't from Kerry at all lol
I hope you'll do more videos like this one. :D This is very entertaining!
15:04 is that the field from spiderman far from home
Yes there is no one Irish accent I’m from Louth and I sound nothing like someone from Cork or Kerry
Pfft as someone from the good ol emerald isle of Donegal, I really wish they casted Irish people to be, irish people xD
I feel like that's the case with the accents of any country, every single province/county/city has a different accent, but people from other countries only know the "average" accent from a country.
Did jack just insult milk
Is it just me or does Sean look more and more Irish as this video goes on
Jack I'm Irish and sometimes I cant even understand my dad and his friends. Kinda confusing
This video is just a representation of my brother trying to do an Irish accent to annoy my cousin
It's like Daniel Craig trying to be southern.... It doesn't fucking work
I can understand the acent
*Pyark*
Me whose Irish and understands everything:|
FARTY FEYEV ship?! 'Ave ye herd of a fence, ye git? ETA my gran was from Cobh, so the Cork-ney accent has a special place in my heart
Did you know that the Irish accents is one of the hardest version of English to understand?
The levels of Irish:  1. Irish  2. Seán  3. The Irish lads
11:53 Fleur?! That’s just French!
how meny other ppl say to themself oil when she said "i"
I feel the farmer might be easier to understand if he didn't have such bad teeth.
I am curious, have you ever seen the movie ‘Far and Away’? I would be curious to hear your take on Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman’s accents
Jack: “Irish people don’t say Top O’ The Mornin” Also Jack on intro to pretty much every video: “TOP O THE MORNIN!!!!!!!!”
He is hard to understand and the school boy i can understand
19:11 That sounded like Sean.
The Irish accent of the Gaelic Gladiators is the best Irish accent I've ever heard😊
Smajor has such a strong accent
The trailer made me cringe so hard
I'm an Irish-Scot but I have a Scottish a Scottish accent and I feel like a lot of the time people don't understand anything I'm saying so I really pronounce my words, syllable and all 😂
We pronounce Ireland Areland
Loved this video it was so funny to try and understand some of the accents😂
When I try to do a Irish accent it's normally for a pizza store and it's horrible but it's finny
In this video... Jack shows irish do's irish things, thank you.
Getting famous actors who are barely irish just cuts me down to the last atom with cringe. Just hire Irish actors. Then there would be a better experience. God's sake lads, the country isn't that big.
The fact that news stories in Ireland are about missing sheep really makes me want to move to Ireland.
I love hearing people talk about stuff they have a lot of knowledge in, the way they light up is so cute!
kind of sad this ended, i love ireland
19:11 feels like a Jacksepticeye impression
aah yes jack the vowel bender
You do not speck like the sheep farmer thank god
People that didn't understand the farmer's accent ;-;  |  | \/
I love these types of sit down and watch videos kinda content
19:10 Im from cork, south ireland, and by god am i so offended about something so true
Period
Jack: So this is what the farmer said... Me: Ah, hm, yes...excuse me but how?
I NEED MOREEEEEE
Can someone make this popular because this is absurd
"te faria senti 'l dialetto perugino vero quant' è tribblo da capi" now try translate this, bet u can't uh. (hint: it's italian) (second hint: it's Perugia's dialect)
The irish leaving cert listenings: Cuid A: 6:11  Cuid B: 3:41  Cuid C : 5:50
Lol Sean's accent does get thicker with this kind of videos it's lovely
A strong irish accent just sounds like they’ve had too much to drink and are slurring their words which is probably the case..
Guy Richie really is a genuis with his movies
Jack: im not good at this accent  Also jack: translated the farmer.  Me: whoat is ol dis then ?
Is he really speaking English????
wtf you dont know the rubber bandits
Jack im french and irish
this makes me want to go to ireland. the end.
exactly! like when americans say “ i love the british accent” its like.. what?? they just mean a north london accent haha. britain has a billion different accents
Only 4k comments in like 5 minutes? Cringe
I read the title as Irish accidents and expected the video just to be jack saying kevin then it ends
I remember when jake used to play Kerbal space program
When is the next Funniest Home Videos????
Idk Irish but sounds goooood
Jack does a better Christopher then Christopher does an Irish
This was great.
Your grand lad grand video
Half of yous are proper irish lads they others are just -_- i am irish my self
I lost it when he said     *”im a vowel bender”*
I’m A VoUl bEndEr
Hilarious! More of these!
People that aren't irish watching this video: huh...?  IIrish people watching this video: dying of laughter of these accents because we sound so bleedin weird
Wow
“Why don’t you hire Irish actors?” Precedes to translate IRiSH to Irish.
Waiting for Mollymauk clips to show up in this
anyone else getting concerned when the lady started saying : HOME STONE BLOWN  as if she was going to suddenly become an owl     just a joke
Idk why, but I find 4:22 hilarious lol
Hey Seán if you want to tour Ireland with a group check out Keegan bus tours. Lovely people and loads of fun. 👍
I'm Indian and even I know that's not Irish
“Haha, eat shit FrAnCe”  -the fucking legend JACKSEPTICEYE
I want to hear him try to understand a thick Appalachian accent now LOL
Im actually trying to learn english....
I remember Jedward was bullied by the judges of X Factor for the accent wtf xD
Lady: “oirland” Sean: “..Ireland”
I'm good with accents generally (from heavy scottish to proper yorkshire), most of these i could understand like the rowers and frostbit guy were pretty clear but my god Irish farmers are a different breed i swear i could barely hear 4 words in that. I always get confused when i see so many people saying Seans accent is unintelligable becuase he prounces everything so clearly
flashback to pre mortem unus annus
I think the reson Americans do the thick accent is because there accents are very flat and I think the reson I don't have much of a problem with the accent is because I'm a gordie and that's fairly similar and I would imagine Scottish would also have an easier time with it
As a scottish person, I love hearing the small similarites in the irish and scottish accents lmao the 'frostbit' bit didn't sound too far off how I've heard some people speak over here XD
I'm welsh, living in Birmingham and I have this weird thing were I can sound Scottish without meaning to
I wish you would do more of this! I absolutely loved this video!! Irish people are just wonderful and I adore how you show us the culture and experiences you have as an Irish lad viewing it and the rest of the world. Cork and Kerry are probably the most interesting accents to me, btw!
I grew up in an appalachian area in America and was told our heritage is a distant Irish (mutt), with similarities in accents (fast,   thick, a few new terms for mundane things) Maybe you'd enjoy listening to our accents for fun 😁✨
I just typed up how to do a Irish accent and the video Sean just looked at was the one I was going to watch
I can understand the middle-level accents pretty good but that one sheep one, only some words registered In my mind!
They gave Harry Potter a British cast...you guys need a better representation. As far as Brad Pii in Snatch... weren't they some kinda Tinker people who are kinda bastardizations of the Irish? The sheep man needs serious subtitles.
my brain:  heheh FARTY five  heheh
297,421st
Jack: "its cringey to say top of the morning" Its your Coffee's name 🤣.
Start drinking more milk bitch -jacksepticeye
My uncle is from tipperary, not only is his accent crazy thick, he mumbles and has a super deep voice. It took me into my late teen years to understand anything he said. Turns out he's a funny dude 🤣
Unas Annus fans were you at?
Irish: 🎶 Sinne Fianna Fail.... Others: I thought you guys speak English? Irish: ..... Ever heard of Irish?
Look up how to speak dublinish
fuck as i started to be so conscious of the accent i started to understand less of the video KJSAHDKUAHDE everything turned just into sound
Oh you should here an Irish Limerick accent
PLEASE react to the US accents everyone loses their s h i t
Irish and scottish isnt sexy
I wish I was blessed with the legendary Irish accent
Heyyy Kevin did thisss
And americans think, peaple here on Brazil speak spanish...
The horse is doing a better Irish accent than the actors. literally everything there on the set or wherever they are filming is doing a better job it making an Irish accent than the real people
English with an Irish accent is a different language
The farmer with the lost sheep sounds like a mix of Welsh and Irish.
Jack you can come beck to Ireland little lad
You should hear northumbrian accents, some of them are right hard to understand. People have occasionally mistaken me as Welsh 🤣
Ahh yes, I member my first day of work in Ireland, a lad fresh from the Netherlands. I got paired with a colleague from Cork for the day and I had not a bleeding clue what in the seven hells she was talking about.
Jack, you should compare your accent now with someone who still lives where you was bought up?
The strong accents sound more Swedish than English
I'm from Kildare we don't have an Irish  accent
Wasn't expecting to be personally attacked in the first 15 seconds of the video...
The Brad Pitt accent is a really good traveller accent
"ISH NASH NEER NA HOYA!"  Me: Pardon?
Irish people are a different breed
I live in the south, and I seriously vibe with a lot of the things he says here about accents. There's *thick* Southern accents that are almost impossible for even other Southerners to understand, and depending on what area of the south you live, you will have a slightly different southern accent. Pretty sure it's like that for most accents, but just thought I'd throw that out there.
Being from Cork, this is actually feckin gas!  Love from Ireland ❤️
If the irish went to war, the enemies would stop in their tracks to try and comrehend what they just said
Lololo
Living in Ireland for the last year, working in a hotel, (when eveything was normal) i can sooo relate to this video and everything this man said is true hahaha
Ok but, the second video subtitles made me laugh ngl
Jacks voice is a solid 34/10 🥱
The eh sound instead of ah makes me wonder if the Cardiff accent was a result of Irish mixing with Welsh in the city.
me wating for him to talk shit about australia so i could say something about me realising he didnt also me thank you lord
There are so many kinds of Irish accent such as the Donegal, kerry, north side, Southside, Kildare, Meath, cork, Midlands, northern Irish, Galway, mayo, bottom right and all the little tiny places.
I am soo happy he done the wee guy that lost his sheep. That kills me. My aunty used to be with a bloke from northern Irland and we went and visited his family and I had to get him to translate everything they said to me (though I was only 5 at the time and used to very scottish accents).   Also how the fuck are we the 3rd sexiest language????
I’m from Puerto Rico and I can still understand the Mad Irish talking people
Jamie Bell in Snowpiercer the movie is pretty spot on with his Irish accent.
He looks like he has orange eyeliner on
This was amazing and confusing all at the same time
Don't forget to subscribe to Jack, Like this video, and ring the bell.
Me American : Oh they sound Irish  Jack : They dont sound Irish at all!  Me : They dont sound Irish at all!
I understood all of the accents because I'm used to Newfoundland accents which are actually more similar than you would think 😂😂😂
I always loved Frank McCourts accent. He was a limerick man, and if you've ever seen Angelas Ashes, that's narrated by the man himself, and it's based on a book he wrote about his life.
They’ve quite the thick accent in the video, very hard to understand
Me: See's the thumbnail Also me:Wait but Jack I can't understand your accent
Don’t have a clue what good old Seán Mac An Tsithigh was on about haha
Not a vowl bender😩😂😂😂😂😂
That sounds like Scotland accent mixed with an Irish accent 5:30
Why would they have Emily Blunt and Walken's trash accents so heavily featured when they have Jamie Dornan, with a Northern Irish accent RIGHT THERE??  One of my favorite things was watching Cillian Murphy and Jamie Dornan do the interview circuit for Anthropoid because you got to hear the difference between a Northern Irish accent and a Cork accent (though Cillian's has become more Dublin as he works in Hollywood and such)
RTE reportter sounds like RT.  And kevin wasn't able to understand the shee farmer.
I never knew he went to college in Limerick
im suprised no one said to jack sean mac an tsithigh as a joke from the sean makglocklin
I legit thought this was from the unus annus video
Jaaack.. ever been to Derry/Londonderry. Same places different names depending on your religion.
Im the 57 %  subscribed
What a delight... I think this is the best video of the year for me.
I feel like they speaking rap god
I'm from Limerick in Ireland and that has to be the funniest accent I ever heard 😭😭😭
15:00 in Denmark we also have a joke. Which island is Denmarks funniest? LOLland
i think jack greatly represents how amazing Irish accents are
"I'm a vowel bender" got me way more than it should have.
Translation was needed.
As an Irish person I just can’t find Irish accents sexy I’m sorry. A thick one sounds like my 75yr old farmer neighbour while a mild one sounds like a yank in disguise.
I'm from Northern Ireland and accents get weird up here too. Been to Donegal loads and have got used to how their accent is. Farthest I've been down south is Dublin. Couldn't stop laughing cuz the 'frostbit' guy was the funniest thing in my school a couple years ago. Much love!
Jack pampering us with some good quality content 👏🏼
At least you don’t have a crisis about del Monte sweet corn
I remember when people accused Jack of faking his accent.
I have been waiting for years for someone to translate that sheep video for me THANK YOU JACK
Sean looking at the videos :  Me, and the fact that English is my second language:  I like your funny words magic man
When Jack said: "He had a rock tied to his neck." Why did he sound like Gru?
45 sheep? A lot? Come to wales innit we got many
Jack you do a better Christopher Walken impression then Christopher Walken does
Its like the USA. Every state has their own accent.
Thought new zealand was voted as the sexiest accent?
The Irish levels in this video are really over 9000!
do Wexford it is fucking brilliant
the first Irish Farmer's accent sounds like a mix between Irish and Norwegian
You should talk to miqzah
why did Jack say bitch so violently
Terroriser's is the best accent
Holy shit a mug for $32
I feel weird because I really love these types of videos and not the collabs like among us and stuffs
Hi
Irish isn't a sexy accent. It's a cool accent, and people can be sexy with the accent, but the accent isn't sexy by itself. Same with Scottish, why was that on the list? I feel like whoever made the list has just fine it every year but realised that accents don't change much so they've got to the point where they're just putting any accents anywhere on the list for the sake of just putting something new out.
Anywan else find the Dublin accent while hard to understand. Just me? 😂
Ill take 3rd
Not sure if my English is bad or my Irish...
Ah bois, where was the Wexford accent!
This video is a gem
Flour no  Flr      Fr    F
I always love when you play with the lads because your accent comes out so much more
This is what Americans think swedes sound like.
Irish man that let fame go to his head
In Brad Pitt’s defense, he was meant to be doing an Irish traveller accent, not just an Irish accent
me, czech, learning english language and thinking that irish and brittish accents sound the same, but irish is drunker
I’m utterly in love with Zane’s character voice on Borderlands 3! Voice actor’s name is Cian Barry I think.
never has "hes speaking the language of gods" resonated so deeply with me.
how can u translate what that man is saying. i cannot pick out one word
I can't understand a single thing the Irish farmer said. Only the reporter
I am from somerset and i understood everything being said in that scene from hot fuzz
Ik this maybe be cringey  but tbh I dont give a fuck but the best Irish  accent  that I THINK that was the best was your jack
You sound like gru when you imitated Christopher
My grandmother who died 26 years ago was from Cork 🙂
"it maybe english"
Please make a video on the Irish language.
IF THE CHARTS CORRECT ALL MUST SUB AND THE 25M WILL TURN TO 50M
Oh, yes, well, I would have to say that of all of the repugnant accents to cone from that godforsaken isle, that a very....VERY subtle northern Irish accent is the only one that does not make my ears blead, gafah! 🧐🎩🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🧐
I have an Italy family but born in Ireland so I have Italian blood but Irish accent. BTW I live 2 hours away from your old cabin and I went past it wen I went on holiday's. Your amazing.
I had literally NO INKLING of what these guys were saying till jack translated
These Irish accents sound like the vikings from how to train your dragon
i really enjoyed this video 😹😹😹
16:17 No, Séan, Irish people do say, or at least used to say, "top of the morning to you" 😂 My evidence is you, and my grandfather, who said it every time he came to visit
LETS GOOOO
"start drinking more milk bitch"  as I was drinking milk
Skid marks
Hi
LMAO I CAN UNDERSTAND YOU BUT NOT THEM 😭
I'm surprised I actually understood the rowers. That was great.
I love how different people from Ireland make fun of people who live in other counties accents
The guy doing an impression of the Cork accent in the cartoon sounds EERILY like Sean.
We need to start making Oirish meyms
Irish sounds like drunk scottish.
Yeah that "Kerry" girl had such a mild accent she was practically English
It feels weird to me that I am not reaciving daily gaming videos from jacksepticeye anymore
Sean: Get ****ed Italy!  Me 25% Italian: *why must you hurt me in this way*
i understand some 😂 most was just “baisjdnsjmznxksk”
I didn't get any one of the jokes    But i was laughing at jack😂😂
I don't even speak english on a regular basis, so confuso-meter was cranked to the MAX.
I bloody love these accents even though I know that I wouldn’t be able to understand them if I were to meet someone with one
There's some guy who keeps asking for hate comments on his video
Me remembering that one Unus Annus video when they called Sean asking him what he thought about their Irish accent.
Please host meme review. Pewds wants you to.
Miss Jason Statham
I couldn't hear a single word when that Irish dude who lost 45 sheep was talking...
He sounded like Arnold Schwartznegger at one time
IDK if it's because English is my second language and the region I come from is butchering my first language (French) like crazy. But I do understand a lot of those. I feel like there's a lot of similarities between Quebecois/French and  Irish/English. Or I have a 6th sens in Irish accent comprehension!! XD
People get like for no reason so there. 1k likes
"Oh Brad Pitt, you're lucky you're gorgeous."
Come back to us Seán! When you come to Ireland come to cork!
Seán : "I'm a vowel bender" 🤣
Whos watching the video with a confused face
Some of them sound like they are speaking simlish
The only person I could not understand reasonably was the farmer, though I was able to pick up a word or 2, on the other side, Aussie is pretty easy, just understanding the meaning of a few words is probably what stumps most people, If an Aussie said " Scarnon mate, I got yah a packet of durry's from the servo afta I went to macca's, thinking of gahin to tha beach in me budgey smugglers, want me to pick ye up sum grog from the bottle-o" obviously there'd be more swearing, but you'd probably hear what their saying, just most non Aussies probably wouldn't know the vocabulary.
Early gang
Can you do a proper Irish slang video please?
14:25 yes... we here in Swords do sound like that, it’s amazing, every third person wears a bubble jacket
sean is going to start a world war XD
I'm Irish but I grew up in America so I have more of a American accent but when I really don't care I slip into my Irish accent. I listened to all of these people and understood everything fluently
Going from dublin to cork is a wild time. The people of cork sound like the are actually speaking Gaelic.
I feel like if i hadn't been watching this channel for so long i would be even more confused
I can understand this . Even though I'm from Galway. Also im a rower 😊
i hope you get to visit Ireland soon. it sucks to be home sick.  Ireland is on my bucket list of places i'd like to visit one day. :)
Thanks Sean!
Hey jack can you make an apex legends season if you have got one can you make season 2 please?
Jack you mad lad, you have done nothing but get better 👍
19:19 I couldn't tell he paused the video and did an impression on the accent
Oh no, I've gotten used to hearing Irish accents after watching this video, that now when I read things in my head, it's Irish!
I got me some of your top of the mornin coffee and hot chocolate!!
This is the best 😂😂
My accent also comes out more when I'm around family or with others who have the same accent. I love it. I need to just keep it 24/7.
And when you say it we say i or eh we don’t say the t
Actually you do your intro like "TOHPOF DA MORNIN TO YOU LADIES" And I love it very much.pls do it again.
This was such a fun video, I'd love to see more videos on Irish accents.♡
Where is sam?
wait, Italy is the 2th most sexiest language?
I didn't know I needed this lmao
This was the funniest thing I’ve ever seen surely make this a serious with other countries. If Australia has different accents 😂😂
Honestly, Sean sounds ever more American with every video... Until he does a video like this.  Also: sometimes Sean's volume/yell reminds me of Chris Rock.
Irish accent the most sexist accent? 2020 is truly a horrible year
A man with a subscriber count 4 times the population of Ireland (Including the North) has single handily brought "Top of the Morning to ya" into the vocabulary.
I have a true philadephia/new jersey mix accent from the United States.  What I can say is that while many have heard the US "southern accent" some of those get so thick they are almost equally hard to understand!!
StAHP making me ireland-sick XD I miss my relatives...
Your kinda like my English stepdad. After a while of knowing him I dont hear his accent. After a while of watching you I dont hear an accent unless you use the Irish mumbling.
In the first video you reacted to, they’re Scottish. Scottish sound just like the Irish.
At least Jamie Dornan is Irish haha
jack way You don't blay Minecraft
Sean pronouncing the farmer’s name: “Shawn Macantehig” Me reading the farmer’s name: “Shawn Mac and ch-SIT HIGH”
americans be like: wow YooouR ACksENtttt is strOOaAAAng
Being irish this is the funniest video I've ever watched
Sean's is the BEST Irish accent, specially when he does these videos and becomes MORE Irish! not that I'm sure how that's possible, but we all heard it here folks !
I'm e mer cun
I feel like if you did a gameplay (with someone else than Irish lads) talking just with your stronger accent, I'd be amazing if you got angry😂
Me: ......I heard maybe something about the moon and lost sheep? Seán: translates a novel Me: HOW??? THAT'S INCREDIBLE!
I feel like the irish accent is like, what dutch is to germans. Dutch sounds a little like drunk german. Weird pronunciation weird tone, it justs sounds off, but at the same time you can hear its kind of german. And to me, the irish accent is excatly like that
Wild mountain thyme just sounds like they're trying to sound like shrek with the accent.
imagine getting frostbutt
Jack is milk gang???
the farmer is speaking the language of gods
My favorite accent has to be you doing Christopher Walken. Just saying. I came to your channel because of your accent. I love it.
That's what we sound like when we talk in our language, nobody can understand, except us. South-African, Afrikaans I'm proud of my language
Would you say JustAMinx has a good Irish accent
Jack is now looking like his fallout 4 character.
i think this is the language of the gods :0
7:48 if Sean spoke the same way I would have just clicked of from his first video i watched back in 2014 cause English ain't my first language and I don't get heavy accents
That was an amazing video and i laughed through it all! hope you and Gab and BB are doing good! much hearts and love! <3
Potato man funny
I’m not Irish but I’m part Irish and i know that lassy ain’t from Kerry
Wait😂 I'm scared, is it bad that I understood the farmer with the sheep the first go watching it... AND IM NOT EVEN IRISH? I'm American, God help us, but I still understood😂😅
yea i vote for you
So this is a video of Sean gigglin' at other Irish people and I am here sitting like "WHAT IS HAPPENIIING?!" cause I understood absolutely nothing XD ♥
I swear the heavier it is the more the Irish accent sounds like a completely different language all together.
You really should go back to Ireland when you can
Welcome to the Jacksepticeye‘s funniest home accident.
Guide to Irish accents video. the Northern Dublin demonstration just sounded like Daithi to me but just a higher pitch
Finally another funniest home videos kinda thing , seán can u please do more funniest home videos
You need to watch some scenes from a movie called “Luck of the Irish” i think it’s a Disney movie and it’s so incredibly bad it’s hilarious
bro ive been in skibereen holy shite
Nothing makes me laugh harder than jack doin Irish voices
Jack does a better impression of Christopher Walken trying to be Irish, than Christopher Walken trying to be Irish lol!
Jack do you mind explaining that shirt you're wearing ;)
Snatch is one of the greatest movies of all time
Let's go pick some "Flears"
Have you seen Derry girls?
This video was beautiful. I laughed so much! Made me fall in love with accents all over again 😂😍
Me whenever I watch Sean's videos:
0:22 ok :(
I miss him saying top of the morning at the start of his videos
The farmer sounds like he's speaking Norwegian
I cringed so hard watching this, it has mocked my country
i got family from apparently county clare am i sexy now?
Title: Irish accents even I can't inderstand Jack: understands them perfectly
Limerick lads where ye at
My favorite Brad Pitt roles are the ones where he makes a bold acting choice and fully commits.  Like Jeffrey Goines in 12 Monkeys, Floyd in True Romance, Aldo Raine in Inglorious Bastards, Chad Feldheimer in Burn After Reading. My favorite will always be Mickey though.
Jack needs to do an episode of this with Nogla and Terrorisor.
Our accents used to be very distinct but younger generations must watch more american or british tv as those accents are more common these days, especially in cities and suburbs. Out in the country most people still have the thick accents.
jack my first language ain't english, I am sure I ain't the only one. what hope is there for us to understand the man at 5:05?
Mirrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
So it tis! So it tis!
Wushu buuuu fly up the mountains with an elytra
Also maybe on your own time so you don’t get copyrighted, check out this Irish punk band called Flogging Molly. Great music and maybe you’ll also enjoy it.
I really hope there wont be any irish people in my IELTS exam XD
We need more of this but with the whole irish squad. Please!!
Austrian is similar to that. Some people you understand as a german. And some you cant understand at all
Look at SGT Ducky  Best and funniest Irish man with an ascent to match
I’m an international student who will study aerospace engineer in Ireland next year , I hope I don’t deal with anime misunderstandings with some of the boomers there , please wish me luck bois.
6:00 he talked more danish than english... must be some old Norse clan.  :)
sounds like talking in reverse
Wait is Sean's hair turning grey?
whel esh ben gefit frutbut
To be fair Brad Pitt's accent is that of a gypsy rather than a full Irishman.
Jack: Yea that’s what we do in Ireland, run around in the fields with our arms out. Also Jack, running through a field with his arms out: I LOVE NATURE
Me and my mom are going to really hard time right now I would love it if you would shout out me in a vid
This is how Hispanic people do when they hear American people trying to talk Spanish
Ok...yeah...What?! What?! Wait ok... Nope....WHAT?!
Low key he sounded like a sad Italian speaking gibberish
I thought I was fluent in English, but i was watching the farmer speaking exactly like this 👁️👄👁️
Honesty I feel like every country has many different accents. Each city you go to specially the ones further away from where you live you’ll find a different accent.
This video just wants me go to ireland so i can understand what the fuck they're saying. Also because i think its beautiful
same problem with scottish accent
I love the beginning of every video. He’s so enthusiastic.
2:22 why did he sound like gru. someone explain.
there is a scene in wreck it ralpth 2 where Merida from brave is talking in a very heavy accent and i'm curious if it actually is Irish or just jibberish :D
What county in ireland are you from. Im from Dublin
north cork accent... oh boy
Your accent gets 10x stronger when you play with the Irish lads or even when you start talking about Ireland, like it just subconsciously becomes more Irish.
The sheep farmer's accent was so thick he sounded Dutch😂 also shocked the fact the phrase "It's fierce mild" wasn't said once
As an irish person myself , I feel like seán should be on the tourism  board
They sound like they tried not to throw up
You should check out the show on Netflix called Peaky Blinders, it takes place in an older time, but maybe the accents themselves will just be fun to look at.
:(
I tried to say Oireland but the bend was so strong that I fell over
I don't think non Irish people realise that there is an accent for every area in ireland
I understand most of the words but I'm Arabian how do I understand that accent
What the hell was that woman woman saying I've never heard any word pronounced like that and I've lived in Ireland for most of my life
I have no accent, but my ancestors, I'm pretty sure, came from Ireland
This is exactly what I need now during my semester abroad in Ireland!
Jack is now a translator lol
you irish are built different
Even when listening it after the translation I couldn't understand what he was saying
That's the most Irish accent I've ever heard and I'm Irish.
This sounds like the Midwestern accent to others
To be real honest, I barely hear Seán's accent, except for when he accentuates it.
How they heck did I understand this dood I’m white and only know American English and just a little Russian
you want to talk actual indecipherable irish accents, try the fuckin listening exams lmao 😭
With the hard Irish accent guy all I hear is sheep and bright😂
Frostbite looks like the g man
You should react to the serie "Derry Girls" lmao
Great job Jack you managed to translate English to English.
If ya want to learn an Irish accent watch Father Ted
Jack doing one I mean
The difference between north and south Wales in accents is just... wow.
i sound like this i am convinced i am Irish but i got my blood tested and i am from America
I can now say that I'm built differently and I almost took a stroke trying to understand the thick accents-  You're accent is really easy to understand and I think mine is too but I guess it depends on where you're from.
*unus annus flashbacks*
I have a parrot living rent free in my brain so this whole video was me trying to copy all the accents (meaning no offense, blame the parrot) and dying of laughter at how amazing they are lmao
Too much laughter! I peed a little jeezz!!!🤣🤣🤣🤣 Im cryin!
Hey does anyone else wander how he would do if he tried to do an American accent?
I'm Irish and IDK what de guy from kerry said ya know boiis
leaving cert listening be like:
I’m just fekin ofened
Irish people are just built different
I say you're allowed in Ireland any time Séan we'll forgive ye after a few pints
Can You Please Play Cold War & Godfall Please like so he can seeeeeeeee
when he said forty five   i thought he said farty five  fart  fart   (im not trying to offend anyone)
Woooow, nice translation seán
Ballyronan is a town near me
The hubby's Irish so I didn't have any problem with them.
Imagine not getting the rubber bandits reference 🥸
The whole point of Brad Pitt's accent in snatch was that his accent was atrocious. Literally you're not supposed to understand it
Things can bend. Aang is an air bender.  *And apparently, Irish people are vowel benders.*
I just feel like that "shhh they're communicating" meme rn
lol... first minute of the vid is me when americans attempt to speak icelandic in a movie... or just in general
Brad Pitt’s accent is perfect—he just sounds black out drunk and like he slipped and bashed his head on a rock the entire time.
It’s funny but I say mirror the same way
dude im litterally drinking milk as he tells me to go drink more milk, so i took another drink of my milk
Seán: Manger de la merde France  Moi: Non.
The German accent is the best and idc too spexy. Also some American accents
Oh you're Irish name all the countys
Earliest I've been here but I love you jack
Are we not gonna talk about those literal rainbow sheep
My favourite accent is Connor McGregors 😄
Love it! This video is hilarious!

Oh my god it's you! Ooing the last vowelbender!
Jack needs to host meme review
I love listening to him talking about Ireland and the accent and stuff he has so much love for it
Irishman watches vids of people talking with Irish accents and laughs. Meme at 11.
Wait... So theres an entire island of people who copy how JackSapticEye speaks? Thats awesome!!!
Jack I can’t find you in the free man film
Even though I have been learning English my entire life i don't think i'm extremely good with it, but hearing Séan speak reminds me of college and what a fun time it was. Hope you're having a great day!
You and call me Kevin have practically made the same vid
"Top of the morning" is so cringy that you just had to turn it into a brand of coffee.
hey my lads
yes
Hi Jack this video brought back memories of my grandparents form my mums side. My nana was from Cork and my granda was from kilkenny.  I have no accent at all being brought up in the U.K. baring the old word that slips in every now and again. This video made me realize how much I miss a good old irish accent. Brilliant video jack you made me and my three lads laugh so much.  Ireland is so weird you just have to love it. .
Me: convinced they're just speaking gibberish.  Jack: _translates_  Me: 👀👀👀👀
As a non-native English speaker I've always thought, that "top of the morning to you" is Jack's self-made Youtube phrase to greet his viewers up until today. The more you know, i guess... 👀
If a list says the Swedish accent is the 7th sexiest then you'd be sure that everything on that list is pure Bullshit.
dude this automaticlly turn german in my head hahaaaa
8:50 That's the trick to a proper thick Irish accent - you just don't move your lips.
In India according to a general consensus we have approx 780 languages with 22 being recognised by the Government. So there is no one funny Indian accent like Apu from Simpsons. 😂
You know that there's a unravel 2 on xbox.
There are 3 levels of Irish accents: 1: Polite and interesting to listen to 2: Slightly loud and sound angry occasionally 3: Ih taek ta sheep on usbsydhebdirbhrud dhdbdh
Third
I feel like am doing my Spanish listening exam

SEÁN THE LAD WITH THE SPAR BAG IS FROM THE RUBBERBANDITS
How tf did you understand that mad irish farmer
Yo!! You got a spot on Walken bro!
Met Gary and Paul one day, Fine lads the both of them
And I thought Cillian Murphy told to sound English during 28 Days Later was bad. Jesus Christ.
2:21 is it just me or does he sounds like gru here 😂

"Tell me, tell me yeh like my hat." "Shey it!"
im learning the irish language and that vocal teacher hurt a little
The heavy Irish accent literally sounds like another language
Man, my fiance's grandfather was born in County Kerry, so I'm quite glad my fiance didn't have an accent, cause I wouldn't have been able to understand a single damn word 🤣
Seán: Manger de la merde France Moi: EXCUSE-MOI. je suis offensé
I actually know your man in the "frostbit" clip his accent still remains a strong Parke accent
5:31 that CANNOT be english
this man needs to react to Father Ted
As someone who's half Irish and who has family with heavy Irish accents, its hard to understand them XD the poor farmer sounded like he was speaking a different language bless him
"How to do an Irish accent" Add H in *EHVHERHYTHING* and replase i with Ä.
Ah yes, Oil land
YO JACK ITS MY BIRTHDAY!!
Me watching this video as an Irish person: This accent is so thicc
How to do an Irish accent people. Been single for years. XD.
When he said "eat shit france" all i could think of if him being and extremly irish commander in the calvary in the 1800's, talking about going to war with france.
The sheep man was extremely hard to understand, frostbite man wasn't that bad, and the Olympic men were fine.
Brad pitt was class in that film, not gonna lie.
I'm from realy close to skibarien in cork  the cork accsent is 100% the best And the joke about something bandon  bandon is a place also near me
Rural Irish check: you have an idea what they’re saying
I am irish and I can't understand that farmer
Watching this video is like talking to my uncle
Was hoping he would have gone through the whole video at the end lol!
Phasmophobia 👻
im HEVILY irish so. that sheep guy is only slightly hard so understand
Jack:- the T sound is SH    Me:-...Shish
"whats the noisiest county in Ireland" if I had to guess, id say whichever one your from Sean XD
Shut up and play a video game!
Honestly I feel like west country accents and Irish are kinda similar...
We need more of this hahah
Has Sean even encountered the people from Newfoundland
The lad with the spar bag is one of the rubberbandits
I once worked with a man from Limerick and my coworkers had a hard time understanding him. They thought it was because he talked too fast, but no, he skipped whole parts of words. Once I was talking to him and he said something about an “am lance” and I was like wtf is an “am lance”? He was absolutely floored that I didn’t know what it was, saying “am lance” multiple times trying to confirm I didn’t know what it was. He then stopped and stated very clearly “AM-BU-LANCE” and I’m like “dude, you can’t skip a full syllable and expect me to know what you’re talking about.” He literally was not saying the “bu” in ambulance. No wonder everyone had such a hard time understanding him.
can anyone check out my YouTube channel i've been grinding on it thanks!
When your voice coach video is scrutinized by JackSepticeye. O____O;;
You should watch the auld hard bucks it’s gas
You should watch black butler and their English accents🤣
i was really hoping he was going to react to the SNL kiss me I'm Irish skit
“Eat shit France”     On t’aime Jack.
Jack that's your trademark keep saying it
I wonder if Jack ever watched the young offenders
I mean im scottish so i understood the sheep farmers it took me a minute but i got it
“Irish Farmer loses their sheep,mad accent”   Me who somehow understands what they say: *MAYBE I AM IRISH*
3:41 *hshchdjsbxbxhsiaixjdjsioa* me: 👀subtitle 👀
Hair is scrumptious
"It's Thyme as in the hhhhherb" 0:53
If Jack did this earlier he could’ve watched the Unus Annus video
You don't know how much something means to you, till you miss it.
But Sean, where in Ireland are you from?!? Woulda loved to know more bout that
this was a DELIGHTFUL video Jack :D had a good laugh after a rough day at work
When your only 23% Irish and understand all of it
Jack don't tell me you don't recognise the rubberbandits from limerick
I know this is irrelevant, but I just ate the driest orange I've ever had
He should make another video where he tries to do other accents.
19:10 - best Irish and most stereotypical accent. Is that "Cork" he's trying to say? It sounds like "caaark".
I lost it at "What the FUCK, Jeff?!" 😂😂😂
Obviously you will not understand Irish 100% hence you are 62% irish (comments correct me on the percentage is it 62 or...)
Scottish is #1 accent since more women think thats better i dont know why, and the list u looked at was 2019
I feel like Canadian are the Irish without the crazy accent unless your from certain places here anyone else know what I mean or am I dumb
23 minute ad about... Ulala
How they gonna hire Christian Grey as an Irishman 😂
why don't you play  the walking dead saints and sinners any more
This felt like watching the what English sounds to non English speakers video all over again.
I enjoyed 👌
The Limerick one at the end kinda sounded like Nogla lol is he from around there?
I can understand the farmer my reasons is I am half Irish I do have a mixture of irish and Australian accent so it's a good trait to have imo
Irish people are built different
5:00 is it bad i can understand quite a bit of it cause ive heard a lot of strong liverpool accents and it made me sometimes understand strong accents (sorry for the bad wording i didnt really know how to phrase it well)
Ye shuld reveewa few mer oxents le yalla bee vairdy interusten ta seeuh un airishmun vew em whit nah cuhntext
Are you from Longford
i love omg. the only comparison i can think of is the pure Devonshire and Cornish farmers
Seán, as an Irish person I have to say     YOUR ACCENT IS GETTING WORSE EVERY VIDEO I'M SORRY
I’m just watching Jacksepticeye laugh at videos that I can’t understand the words in
Let me show you how to do an American accent without even speaking  Just say everything in the most disrespectful way possible. You say soda? POP! But say pop super flat and disrespectful   So American accent isn't that hard
8:09 My man looks like G man if he was 16& Irish
Galway > All the other mank Counties
I’m Irish but eve I couldn’t understand that sheep farmer
i understood the schoolboy but the farmer? jeez
I just saw my country got ranked 5 and I have so many questions
Do you speak Irish ?
I'll be real with ye, the cork accent you'll really only find in the countryside most cork accents are actually not that high😂😂
I'm gonna be honest and say this, I honestly thought that the herder was speaking galic
Do some Northern Irish accents. It's a whole different breed of accents up here. That's 2nd clip of the man getting frostbit is from Londonderry
You should watch thick scottish accents and try to understand those
This makes me so damn nostalgic. I've lost my accent to be replaced by the far worse Midwestern US accent (even my deeply Wisconsin mum agrees) and have been soo deeply ingrained in the American language. I miss having to decode my teacher's lectures.
This was a fun one! It's so weird to me that people think all Irish people sound the same. I'm American (from upstate NY) and I don't sound anything like people from the city (like a stereotypical Brooklyn accent for example). When I go outside NY sometimes people don't even believe I'm from there cause I don't sound like they think I should. Honestly though, I agree most of the Irish accents are pretty sexy, especially Jack's LOL!
I love how you’re just able to laugh along with the deep accents haha makes it more relatable
Try listening to the Newfoundlander accents
Your accent was the best accent
I could understand almost all of what the rowers said and the majority of what the school boy said, but I honest to God could not understand a single thing that sheep farmer said
jack play red dead redemption 2  there is a Irish guy
I think Jack's accent is the best one
This sounds like the Irish equivalent of American game companies making English characters
guess I'm secretly irish
“Ha ha eat shit France”
Im from Europe (from Poland) and I have Belrusian accent and my English sucks honestly    *sad polish noisis*
Love the irish accent it is
Am I like the only noon Irish person who doesn't have too much trouble understanding this (I'm from the UK so that probably helps)
Try and think of an actor that has done a good Irish accent... you can't can you?
I heard go out to the mountains with elytra
The longer i watched, the less Irish Jack sounded! 😅 PS, next episode you should do the whole thing in a Bri'ish accent and we'll judge you! ;-)
There is not any one Irish accent. Theres god knowes how many of them. Those accents were pure diabolical and another thing, they didn't learn the language that is Irish Slang. Not a single slang word at all. Pure shite that first film will be i'd say.
At first I thought the sheep guy basically just said, his sheep followed the light of the full moon 😂
Please do a video talking irish
No you dont sound irish anymore
from now whenever i see a child i will say "start drinking more milk bitch" words from a true legend
Christopher Walkan doing anything other than his specific accent (yes he has his own accent beyond regional 😂) is a fail and the walkan comes thru strong it’s hilarious 😂
I am only a fast talker, not a irish accent. Its such a disappointment but at the same time a blessing.    So atleast some people can understand me.
its like that distorted voice that when they tell you what it is you can understand it.
lmao i was jUST watching you and ur irish friends
He's trolling right? like there's no way any one in this video was speaking English
I’m Irish and I could hardly understand anything being said
Good to know that if I move to kelly I’ll be able to understand 😂
(screems in Irish)
I love these videos, where he just does some random crap and it ends up being fun to watch
LIMERICK CITY *inhales * KIIIIIIIIIIIIDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
All the irish boys should go backto Irelend for a vlog and play golf it irl
I love how he shits on Italy and France yet goes gentle on Scotland, love it XD
The best part of this vid is Seán getting progressively more Irish as the video goes along. He practically turned green! All the while, participating in the greatest of Irish traditions...Making fun of people. Don't ever be embarrassed of that that accent Seán. It could be worse. Could be Swedish...Poor poor Felix...
have you seen the short video of the irish guy stuck on the roof of a house getting mad and yelling at his friend who's on the ground? that guy has a pretty strong accent too
I understand Eminem better than the videos he watched. Hahahaha
But jack! I'm already subscribed what else can I do?!
For all the questions in this vid: YES!
one cannot "do" an irish accent. you must be a master, a scholar if you will.
Dude you should be in the new shark boi and lava girl movie you wud do great
he is trying to be terminator at 2:22 lol
I'm sorry I had to dislike this   Know one else dislike
Ditto on bad accents. I’m from the southern United States and when I hear an actor or actress try to use a southern drawl I cringe.
THE IRISH GUIDE yer wan YER man Shhhhhhhhhh Well lads Lad Well Well keed Acting the Maggot Your a bit ah a ghoul What's the Craic What's the Craic Bai I'll shee ye later lads Tanks byebyebyebyebyebyebyebyebyebyebyebyebyebyebyebyebyebyebyebyenow
I can understand what that Irish Lad is sayin
Why does everyone in these vids just sound like they are saying hdoe fyekzj2vudnzjdjdifbxkgdkdowbdyaoabdgudebd
I wish he reviewed the accent in DerryGirls
FYI Jack, this was fun
5:50 this is probably what English sounds like to people who don’t speak it
The Irish are so Irish the Irish man couldn't even understand
Reaching jackaboy’s Irish levels are physically impossible 🍀
I was born in America but I'm 75 percent Irish while my dad's 100 percent and I somewhat understand the thick Irish accent but you definitely dont have a thick accent also this is funny for some reason
I want to hear some country Welsh. Those are even worse
I cannot believe Sean could translate the sheep farmer for us
I like how he shits in peoples faces when he is number 1
It's like when jack comes back to Ireland call me kevin is the king of the hole place kevin just took over of  the hole place he's just the god now
Those accents were so heavy, even Betapixl (the editor) couldn't put subtitles
That sheep farmer reminds me of the old farmer in hot fuzz, where three steps of translation is needed.  Edit: and directly after I commented and resumed watching, wouldn’t ya know what comes up.
THAT-WHAT IS THAT ACCENT
18:58 I-I haven't heard it in a while, but from what I remember, that sounds so much like the narrator in "the I of It"
Jack accent is there, but it is even close or that bold of an Irish accent. His is like a whisper of an Irish accent with all of the hard vowels. 😂
I am Irish and if I didn’t see the words to the second video I would not been able to understand that
Lady: "In Ireland they say "I" as "oih"." Me, not knowing a thing about Irish accent: "That doesn't seem ri-" Jack: *face of horror* Me: "I stand correct then."
Tbh Shawn. your voice is nice because it's different. Sometimes I watch you just to hear a different voice.
I love jacks irish videos, theyre all super fun xD
And frome watching jack septick eiy i some timse prnouns my r's funy
The lad with the sheep in kerry is inaudible 🤣 I've seen that video loads and i still can't understand it (I'm from Mullingar)
ah yes rte
What happened to the "top of the morning to you laddies" intro ?
I/ oil
Seeing Jack's reaction to someone teaching others how to do an Irish accent had me on the floor......
DANG youtube changed their thing so that we can't skip them by ending the video and replaying it F**CK
Him commenting abt all the accents is so true tho like some places have really strong accents and places(especially in the north) have really light accents
that's weird can someone explain why i understood what he said
"Irish people really are just built differently aren't we" well that's what makes all y'all lads cool mate ain't nothing wrong it.
I have a VERY HEAVY working class Dublin accent🤣🤣
Jack telling us "that's what we do in Ireland, hang around in fields and run around with our arms out", as if everyone of us didn't already know this as facts about Irish people 😂
U no what it would be good to go ona good fishing trip with sean idk but i just was imagining us going fishing in a good spot me and a friend go to
JACK I BEG YOU TO MAKE MORE MAN EATER!!!   THAT AN IDEA FOR A FUTURE VIDEO!!!!
the only thing i got from this is Daithi is probably from Cork
Wtf is dat farmer saying I’m (Irish and this is hilarious for me)
Try listening to someone with a thick Newfoundland accent. It's like an Irish accent but even weirder.
Only thing I can compare this to is when I, a Texan with a fairly mild accent, have to translate for my grampa, who sounds like Boomhauer from King of the Hill. 😂
Well, when I was in ireland I was in college in Limerick city too. Now I kinda want to know which college Jack went to.
Insane 32k likes in an hour
sean does a better christopher walken impression than walken trying to do an irish accent
Sometimes the southern US accent (Texas, Louisiana, etc) is just as hard to understand especially when they throw in some jargon and slang around  Yeehaw pardner
the irish rowers have a preety undestandable accent
I don't understand Seán Mac An tsithigh's accent but i like it
There's a show called Bridget and Eamon  It's kinda funny
WTH THSATS NOT EVEN RIGHT
Can you please try a Scottish one 😂 I have a cross between a northern eastern Scottish accent and a north west English accent and everyone thinks I'm either Irish or Canadian...??? So Scottish accents must be like Irish accents, I mean Scottish and Irish people all talk super fast anyway 😂
I loved this video. It's always fun seeing Jack being so happy while talking about Ireland
Jack, i'm sorry but the old man who lost his sheep, it reminds me of the scots language. I speak scots (being a scot myself) and omfg this had me jumping through loops since it sounds like things it shouldn't be! XD LMAO
Matt mercer is doing an irish accent for critical role now, if you don't care about spoilers you could check it out :)
Know listen to heavy american acsent
10:51 my face matched Sean's exactly, pure disgust at her accent
Nobody ecer gives us Northerners credit for our accent. We may sound a bit scary sometimes but were nice people too i promise
0:13 i can disagree
It took multiple attempts to watch this whole video as an Irish person
Snatch my favorite gangster movie 😎😎😎
yours was the best for sure.
As a Polish person living in Ireland its so hard for me to understand some accents   Like Kerry but I'm sure no-one can understand that accent
Jack if you watch the Mandalorian, the episode on season 2 episode 11 the guy that is the general on the air craft is an irishman that was on Sons of Anarchy but he does an insane american accent
You have to comment no on the how to irish accent video pls
Also the cork accent is the best though I do love any northern Ireland accent tho
I'm impressed with how much I understood and Cork isn't that bad, but as you said there isn't just one per county XD Thank you for a great vid before I sleep and take care of yourself please, Mate
Idk about accent but, I love the North Dublin girl..wanna fall for her 💚.
bhuel ar a laghad ní hionann tú agus muintir na hAlban
😂😂😂
I thought I'd be able to understand the people talking because I'm a Newfie and we share quite similar culture and speach patterns but nah, I understood nothing lmao
Me: *watches this video* Also Me: *flashbacks to Unus Annus*
in wild mountain thyme, there's  an actor called Jamie Dornan, he's actually Irish!
7:44 I'm french and I can understand you perfectly, your accent is not that heavy. That farmer though, I'm gonna have nightmares about being lost alone in southern Ireland.
Eh, Scottish accents are still better.
Checkout Chibs from Sons of Anarchy Jackie boy(Irish accent)
is the cork accent the Irish version of the Liverpool accent in the UK?
That actually was the best thing ever
I am enthralled by your homeland, magic man
From Wexford and even I can't understand the Kerry farmer
Top of the morning
👀 I remember the Missing Sheep guy, can be a challenge to 'translate' but eventually you'll get it. The last video was xD 👌 I remember having to watch it for a class project. Whether it was reliable or not, still got me the high score 👌 A bro of mine got to travel to Dublin (before pandemic) & kept saying how beautiful it was & how he'd like to go back on his free time (stayed for a project). Hopefully he does, so I can go with him xD. Thank you for the fun video, nice to pick up some new 'vocab' from ya, keep being awesome & safe bro 🍀 😎 👊  0:59 👀 xD 3:40 He did try (can be a challenge to try/pull off) 4:49 Oh no xD The Mad Lad missing sheep 6:00 I know what he's saying xD but alright x) 10:05 👀 Oh no xD 12:11 Depends on region/area/section 👌12:46 Jack xD. 15:04 Oh xD. 18:14 x/ I remember that vid xD 20:32 Craic 👌
you don't sound the way people do impressions, its just the way people do impressions 😂
Soooo if what jack said is true than it's Jacksepshiceye not jacksepticeye
13:29 General Kenobi
Kneel down peasants before the "Vowelbender"!!!
I wanna hear Sean react to patois.
I catch accent easy
That Iris farmer sounded German
The shepherd has such a deep accent that it's so close to Norweigan that I thought I could understand it.
Why am I watching a CallMeKevin video?
I came here for frostbit boy and I was not disappointed
Jack are you aware Disney is stealing your content
WHERE IS ANTI
all i hear is complete gibberish but i love it so much
Ah shite, here we go.   (Resident north dub here)
Ok don’t come at me for this but I think men with Irish accents sound like slightly better than women with Irish accents but it really depends on the county/town.
All of these accents are just stereotypes of Irish accents
Why I it sounds like germany
I wouldn't say the Irish accent sounds "sexy" but very wholesome
the way bthe kerry girl said luck she sounded welsh
I am Irish myself and couldn't understand the man with the sheep   Btw I am not fully Irish just half irish
Next video - what do Irish people think about the different British accents?
I know Dublin doesn't exactly have the stronger accents, but some of this is gibberish.
I love Sean’s impressions of a thick Irish accent
please do this again this is great
this is me, a south Floridian watching all those “florida man” videos, which are just northern florida trailer park dwellers and having absolutely NO IDEA what those people are saying
Half of them I barely could understand and I am good at voice acting
Sometimes the Irish accent and the Scottish accent sound familiar ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
dont forget the new god of war 2021
ive been watching him for so long i even forgot he had an irish accent
I don't know what just happened I could barely understand anything but I need more of it please!
I love Irish accents 🍀
They say Christopher Walken is a tiny Irish. Allegedly. But he's 100% New Yorker lol
jack: big smiling jeff: i am so sorry to do this to you but can you say top of the mornig to ye jack: smile disappears
The dude's accent is so heavy i thought he was speaking german for a second
No Seán... u don’t sound like that old man also named Seán
U need to watch Nogla misspeaking compilation
Listen if you’re talking about the Kerry accent you should look up sham
the next three scary games video is just gonna be jack watching the julia roberts movie start to finish
Those accents are cool and interesting 🧐
After listening to all of those accents, then going to that lady who wasn’t Irish I was like “ oh I get it “
oof
Irish and scottish accents are truly a thing of beauty. Coming from a spanish speaking country, hearing that Saoirse Ronan girl speak for example, is mesmerizing.
Here before 1million views:") damn it's an achievement huh? Like ooff
Anyone else remember when 720p was seen as HD?

I'm absolutely awful at doing accents but surprisingly I can understand a lot of them fairly well. I could only half understand that sheep farmer guy, though, like..... WHEW.
100 percent the most hilarious human being I feel like I have watched in a long time.  Examples  Irish accent = 100%  *Jackscepticeye : France, Italy, Scottish, get 💩💩💩💩 on* his words not mine.
Maybe you should do those videos again where you have to guess what the different viewers sent you in their language/ accents
the irish accent just sounds like they haven't learnt that your tong is allowed to move from the left to right as well as up and down
It just sounds normal to me come on baaaays
Only us Irish may understand the tongue of gods
This is great
If only Germans would have figured out how to send Irish voice code then things would have been  different. Smh.
It kinda sounds like german
I'm sorry to say but you and markipliers channels have became shit the more you moves from gameing
Irish farmer is going to be the new Florida man.
I mean the girl from "Kerry" is pretty cjejjxx.
Him cracking himself up is wonderful
I do love Irish accents, the Cork one being the most fun.  But sexiest for me goes to Scottish thanks to David Tennant LOL
This is how I feel when actors do southern accents, because in the old days in the Appalachian mountains in one town they could talk slow with a deep drawl and take an hour to tell a 5 min story where as a town 2 miles down river could talk so fast you can't understand them. Not every southern person talks like a plantation owner or some belle.
Captions: Unavailable       Sounds about right
U should go back and play We Happy Few
No, you don’t sound like that. Your accent does come through but you also tend to enunciate english... so us uncultured americans can understand you easily. I’m considered a southerner (Texas) so sometimes my accent is hard to understand.
Is it weird that i could understand the rowers and the second sheep guy who said, you just need a good dog. m from asia
Let's be honest the real thing that inspired this is Ethan's god awful attempt at an Irish accent
i live in irleand co.kerry and my neighbor has such a fucking accent hes so hard to understand i could understand quite a bit of the irish farmer while i cant understand shit from my neighbor
Do some of those farmers speak Gaelic regularly because I can't understand how an accent like that comes to be
The "WILD MOUNTAIN THYME" actors trying to sound Irish sound like if Arnold Schwarzenegger tried to be Irish.
His basically a diet callmekevin at this stage.
The way the vocal coach said “flour” sounds like something Felix would say 🤣
Irish people exist ya know, you don't have to fake having an irish accent
Watch foil arms and hogs how to speak dublin
have you check gerard butler?
Jack translates his people. . Please let this become a full series 🙏
Jack: Alright ill translate for ya  Me: There’s no way he can understand that Jack: fully translates it  Me: ö
there were parts that had such a thick accent that i couldn’t tell if it was gaelic or english for a moment
0:23 Hold on...Why Italian Second on Sexiest Accent and not the Corpse Husband Accents? that is not right so this shit rigged
Movie time with Jacksepticeye
when he said drink more milk bish i just thought about the gallons apon gallons i have drank over my childhood a still so 0-o
The guide to Irish accents the little cartoon dude for Limerick was one of the rubberbandits. How did you not get that Seán, tut tut verdy disappointed. 😂😂
It's like trying to do an "African" accent. There are just way too many and you'll have to be more specific about the region.
People trying to do a Irish accent: simple challenge I call bullshit on that.
Facts got shut down and became the TRY channel fyi!
funny enough, i didn't know that Italian was in second place on the list of "sexiest accents" and it's actually the first time i felt kinda proud of being italian. so I'm happy to know that me and Seán have the two sexiest accents in the world
As an Irishman I can confirm I have no clue what the sheep fella is talking about
The Irish accent has helped me overcome my speech impediment
Lol the whole video
There is another Sean in RDR2 who is Irish which I think you probably know...
I bet most of the votes for Irish is the sexiest accent were fans of jack
Lmfao mirror is a great one even for us up north, it goes miiiiiir or murrrrrrr or a really overpronounced mirROR 😂
Now if they were speaking In Irish it would be a whole lot worse
I’m learning I can understand people my age with Irish accents, but even fellow Americans trying to talk in a “middle aged Irish accent” is almost impossible to understand. Kind of makes me think the internet/videogames have started to create a global accent
Are we not going to talk about how great Jack's Christopher Walken impression was
I mean this in the nicest way possible...Irish people sound like 3 year old going on some tangent where you follow in the first half and then get completely lost in the second.
Jack completely wrecking that tutorial on irish accents SENT ME 😂
(Not being rude, this is just a joke)   Jack: Was born Irish   Also Jack: Let's learn Irish that I can't understand!
That’s mad I literally am in da middle of hot fuzz
Your eyes have a little bit orange color around them, you look like u went Sage Mode Luv u btw <3
Lol so many great Irish actors out there and they're like WE DON'T WANT ANY OF THEM.
I only have ONE question, WHY WAS BRAD PITT TALKING THAT THAT? HE WAS LIKE "FUWUWUFHUHHF WUU3 CARAVAN EWFH4CIFJFX3 ME MA R3QFNCHQOP CARAVAN"
Some Irish people seem to speak different language 👀
I need an Hour of this.
Pure and utter shite 😂
Hey séan, what if you did a video about Dutch accents with Gab.  Zou ik wel leuk vinden MAAT !
“Eat shit France” is my motto
9:36 dang there last names are pretty close to my first name.
plastic bag on limric fella   is the rubber bandits]
Irish wrist watch 10 times fast
7:47 "is this what I sound like?" Only when your playin' wit da bayz.
Ah, yes, frostbutt
Remember when people said he wasnt Irish, good times
Leave a like if you’re Irish
You know what. Only thing I got was sheep
Sean missing Ireland like crazy XD
6:58 and thats exactly how my family feels about the Irish. They just can't understand them.
Brad Pitt sounds like he visited ulster, picked up the accent, and then tried to do a south dublin accent
5:35 ooooh i get it, that's why there was that old man in HotFuzz  Edit: he knew... f
They might as well be speaking ancient english or just straight up speaking irish
ThE mOsT sExIeSt AcCeNt Edit: the Irish farmer's mad accent was so fast and quick in the subtitles lol.
Sorry Jack im late and sorry im not watch your video because im busy
Newfoundland, the Ireland of North America.
Seán your Irish accent is terrible
no one:  irish lads: the sHeeEiIIEp wErAE MiAssSaaAng
Damn I must be in the minority but I don't find Irish accents attractive in the LEAST. I would actually say they're one of the least sexy imo. However, they sound AWESOME and I love how Jack's gets stronger throughout the video lmao
I’m so glad that as a Scots man I can still understand it
Ooooh I love Irish accents
The Kerry accent may be bad, but look  at Cavan!
I love this!
Sean, you LEGALLY now have to hang out with Robert Sheehan. it’s a law
There ears are natural translaters
Jack: Wow there are parts of Ireland with people who have accents that even I the irish man can't understand?  Me: 1:58
H played an Irishman a few years ago in another movie and did the same thing. just spoke like he normally would
It's Kind Of The Same Here In America With Southern Accents Jack...The Show "MoonShiners" Had Subtitles Because A Number Of People Couldn't Understand People Speaking With South Carolina/Tennessee Accents...lol
4:50 I actually had an Irish teacher in English class (oral practice more specifically) and she shew us this video and said it was okay to have an accent as long as we are more understandable than this guy 😂  We then had to talk by pairs and she saw I was alone so instead of creating a group of three she decided to talk with me for a couple minutes and she said I had a good English (even though I know it's not quite true, because I'm always babbling anxiously which can make it hard to understand me).  The next year I had her as a teacher again in a subject where we had to discuss the adaptation of an English work into a movie and make a presentation about it. And instead of imposing us to work on specific movies her colleagues had chosen she let us choose our own adaptations and everyone was really happy about it.  I did a presentation about the adaptation of the comics Watchmen and (since it was during quarantine) I recorded myself, except I was really anxious and found myself out of breath so I had a hard time speaking and was making quite a lot of mistakes. So I sent it to her and told her she might have a hard time understanding me, but she took the time to respond to me and said she had listened to it and it was fine.  She really is a super nice teacher and everyone loves her which is why I often catch myself thinking Irish people must be really nice seeing how she and Seán are such nice people.
Seán, everyone in this video sounded just like you when ur talking with the lads, get better headphones.
Weirdly entertaining vedio
Be jaysus 🧡 tis a beauty of a ting de ole irish shpeal 😂
I be scottish. INSULTED
Sean I know you’re an Offaly man like myself but we’re tick fuckers so we wouldn’t be able to understand any accent outside of the county lol
5:00 thats how daithi sounds for non irish ppl
When he did the Christopher walken impression it was actually pretty good,lol
KINDA SUS
It’s weird, I live in America, I’m more Irish than American/European, no accent. But I have the Bluest eyes out of everyone in my family
I wish they’d do Ulster Scot or Ulster English.
Ayo, what county do you live in? I live in Waterford 😂
6:47 Did he say Fortnite? I swear, if that farmer has a thing for Battle Royales, first, odd combo, second, odd choice
2:21 he kinda sounded like doofenshmirtz😂😂
Bro I thought that farmer was speaking just straight up Gaelic lmao
Pictured : me trying to mimic my irish grandma
Dohntsh foerghet tuh leighk ahnd sohbscreighb!!
Jack: Thirty-Five.  Me: Fartty five? Lol.  My Brain: Fartty Five, Smelly Four, Poopy Three, Shitty Two, Dirty One!
I loved that! I find accents so interesting to listen to, so if you want to do a video like that again, I'm so here for it!!
Jack just insulted my country.
Plot twist : its actually the correct pronunciation and the most fluent irish accent
Oh. My. Goodness. Jack is Rocket Raccoon and everyone else is Groot.
"What the fuck jeff" 😂😂😂😂
At least we swedes are in the top 10
I don't think I can go to southern Ireland with that accent
Non Irish people wondering why Sean is mocking people’s accents in his own accent
OMG the "How to do an Irish Accent" video has me rolling on the floor, like. That's why people speak "OIRISH" in things, because they don't know any better than listening to these "experts". Has she EVER met someone from Ireland?????
HELLO
I love hearing foreign accents.
Have you send the show Derry Girls? How accurate is it?
Sean your Irish accent too fake lol
Sean: Irish accents are the sexiest accents in the world.  Russians: YOU DARE OPPOSE ME MORTAL
The title should be : Loud mouth Irish Youtuber reacts to people speaking Irish.
Do a Bristol Accent Jack.
Meanwhile Felix: "What's all this then?"
Hhhhmmm I'm hungry what should I eat ?
I have problems understanding some accents. Unless I've been around someone who speaks one of them. For example I don't understand the Scottish accent but understand a Scottish man I know. I don't understand the Irish accent but understand Sèan. Probably because I'm always watching his videos. I have problems with Nigerian and Asian. It's a problem at times. Especially when I used to work for a Asian couple. 🙄🙄🙄🙄
The one Irish accent Ioved is William Dafoe in the lighthouse.
Apparently Jack has been doing his accent wrong according to that vocal coach
They were from Cork?? That's where I get my Irish roots from 😂🤦😂
The cork accent in the final video was so spot on it’s crazy 😂😂😂
Being from cork and my dad still having a slight accent (we’ve lived in the uk for 7 years) that last video made me and my dad laugh so bloody much 😹
0:41 GOT ‘EM
I'm not a native English speaker and I'm from Europe, so I'm used to so many different English accents. Mostly because of BBC. I never thought that example every day British is that much of a difference to every day American, but YouTube collabs proved me oh so wrong 😁 It's also always entertaining when Americans believes that they don't have any acsent 😂
I'm Irish and I can only understand half the things the first farmer is saying
I laughed my ass off the whole vid😂😂😂😂
I'm sorry, Sean, but although I love (some) Irish accents, Aussie accents are the sexiest.
I always like learning about Jack’s Irish background.
I went to read the comments, and realized I was reading them all in an Irish accent.
I could understand those Irish people
What do we do with drunken sailor   what do we do with drunken sailor   what do we do with drunken sailor  Early in the mornin'!
shouldn't it be butt of the evening to ya?
I was living in Ireland for pretty long time, yet, a lot of accents all around Ireland sounded like turkey's to me :D (I was living in City Cork moslty and i loved their accent the most ^^)
I have met drunk people that sound like this and they're not even Irish
'Tis a powerful tin'.
Please make more irish videos
he should've used the irish dude who can't get down from the roof, that video is hillarious :')
Living in a small town in cork is the strangest thing, It feels like that one episode of SpongeBob when he's in the marina trench trying to get a bus, the people feel like characters. And the guys accent at the end of the video was spot on.
Flower=flarrrre
Have you watched Black ‘47? I just watched it recently on Netflix. Imagine John Wick existing in Ireland, 1847 as he goes on a redemption adventure against the British. I recommend!
Snatch is actually one of my fav movies
" your one " is a great woman to be eatin them p-o-t-a-t-o-e-s and drinking tea.....
Being Irish and watching this just makes me feel better about myself
here before 200k!
Jack teach Felix Irish on ur channel and get Felix to teach u Swedish on his channel if u can.
This is unrelated to the video but are you planning on going back to subnautica below zero any time soon?
Im going to try this with a Scottish accent.
Love the vid. Can you play 1.16 Minecraft please.
i lost it at " I am a vowel bender"
Jack: Tells me to drink milk Me: Im allergic you di- 😂
They should do movies that have real people with the real accents instead of faked ones make it realistic make it more immersive
i clicked on this video faster than james charles can say "hey sisters"
7:32 SEÁN MAC AN t (sit - high ) why is the t lower case though?
Some day a Couple with Cajun roots and Irish roots will have a baby and the poor kid will never be understood :)
I can understand most of them accents but I am Scottish and we got our own version of those horrendously difficult accents to deal with too... the most common "hard one" being Glaswegian but the further north and more rural you get the more like Brad Pitt's pikey accent you get and worse... I got lucky with my accent as I grew up it got slower and clearer but used to still talk way to fast :P
We are from the same county, but I’m closer to Dublin and the coast. My area has a mix of sea fairing accents and “posh” accents not quite Dublin cuz we are more south. Some of our Gaelic, has latin in it. “Conas tá tú” vs “Conas tá shiv.”
the fact that scottish was up there we sound like the most clueless and agressive folk out there
Should do one of these with Kevin
for me google says it's "French" .
in my country SPAR is the most exspensive markets
My first trip abroad was to Cork in Ireland and I coudn't understand anyone 😂 I thought my english was just shitty. Now I understand.
I have to say, I’m from Cork and I can agree some of the accents down here in the south can be quite mad 😂
7:50 back when you had green hair and I had to turn my phone/tv down to watch your intro   That.. that’s what you sounded like
I am a bit Irish from my dad
why do i think that he has google  translate open no one just me ok
I honestly think of the time when Unus Annus did an Irish Accent
so im irish but live in the UK and was just wondering if anyone else says film as filum.  just me... ok
This was great :)
2:21 Sounds like Arnold to me 😂
idk why but im so happy you know what hot fuzz is   lol i forgot you mentioned it in a few videos
This was very interesting information about Ireland
I needed this, south Dublin ffs
As an Irish person, most of this is so hard to understand
It's a bit weird that I almost can  understand the irish accents pretty good everytime I hear them even though I'm from middle Europe. Maybe watching videos of the lads helped me or maybe I had irish ancestors or something xD  But anyway, I absolutely love you lads play together and also reacting to irish stuff on your channels. Hope we get more content of the lads in the future ^-^ I'm already really excited for you to continue Raft because it was an absolute blast
45 minutes ago and 3k comments
Irish accent may be sexiest yes but which dialect? as Sean says in a previous Vid, go from Cork to Dublin or Donegal, you'll hit about 4 million different Irish accents  man what a wonderful island we have
Irishman does not recognise the rubber bandits................... nooooooooooooooo
Jack can you like this please
Ah the Irish.. A great bunch o’ lads
What county is daithi from
I love Irish accents
5 Stars.  Laughed alot at this one
in my country SPAR is im front of my apartment
Love u Jack
You say the t sounds like sh but when Brian says thank you it comes out as tanks you
I love how my family are from Kerry and this is how they’re doing back home. I’m a traitor and an Englishman
How does anybody get any information from that sheep farmer
Subtitle: Man: * unintelligible sounds”
what sorcery is this how do you understand what he says?
If ya like accents, watch Fries, Gronings and Brabants in one session with Evelien...even she will go, What? Cus she’s from ABN county....we are so small but if you travel like 30 mins an other direction, you’d have an other accent here in the Netherlands....so weird.
I barely understand the Irish farmer and im Irish
YO
Jack havin a crack about his heritage chat  (his blood) Hnnnnnngh... *SIGH* felt like an overdue stretch and jog through the morning fog
Brad pitt was speaking in irish cursive
Is the mad Irish farmer speaking English? It doesn’t even sound like he is
Man, how i love to hear you laugh!♥️
I hope if Jack does something like this again, he’ll judge more movie and TV shows on their Irish depictions and accents, and I hope he includes “Blown Away” (starring Jeff Bridges, Lloyd Bridges, and Tommy Lee Jones)- that’s an Irish-featuring movie I wonder if he’s seen.
you should do norn irish accents and see if you can understand them
6:42 sea mine
I kinda want to see you do one on Aussie accents, just to see what you think. I don’t believe there is an Aussie accent, cause I don’t hear it any more, but apparently it’s pretty strong. If you do it though don’t get it mixed up with the bloody Kiwi accent.
The Snatch accent is meant to be Irish Traveller, not your mainstream Irish. I don't know if that means it was more or less accurate, but it isn't a total surprise that it would sound "off" to an Irishman.
The only irish accent i can pinpoint on the spot is belfast , its just so specific a sound
Wait- is Seán wearing eyeshadow!? If so...  YEEEAAAAAHHH! I love it, you look amazing
What part of Ireland is Fack from
The frosbit one for me he sounds more northern Irish  But idk even tho I'm from there 😂
Lol that man with the sheep makes me think as a southerner in georgia I am from the coastal part savannah relatives come down from the mountains like hillbilly deluxe people and we barley had a clue what the hell these 2 older people said thankfully they used there hands which helped lol 😆 my fav is the sheep man he's amazing
Jack should've seen Brad Pitt's accent in The Devil's Own
Why do some of these sOUND LIKE A FOREIGN LANGUAGE ARE YALL OKAY???
I want a video of Jack/Sean speaking Irish for 9 miniutes.
I’m from Northern Ireland so I understand them but I wish I didn’t. (Armagh)
It seems like people from other region start talking in scotish accent when they try to talk in irish accent.
yep, just gonna delete my old cringy ass irish comment.. great video💀its so dumb, istg lmfao.
I'm having flashbacks to that one unus annus video
So Conor Mcgregor must be northside dublin
This guy actually went as far as to turn off the captions so we couldn’t understand what the fuck anybody was saying
I'm from kerry lol
2:20 Sean sounds like a mix between Gru from despicable me and Arnold Schwarzenegger
Sean "and if i do im so sorry" me lol
The rowers from cork would be good ventriloquists. When they talk, their mouths barely move at all
Yo they adapted Jack's nature vlog for a movie niceuuuu, (I LOVE NATURE SO MUCH!!!)
i feel attacked im italian
the irish famer sounds like borat
You should do an irish charity stream with the irish lads to help small businesses over in ireland! Call it the charmed accent charity fund! Wooo!
God I cant wait to develop an irish accent when I move there
Brad Pitt sounded so stereotypically Irish that he forgot how to speak English.
Is it just me, because sometimes I forget he's Irish, not in a bad way I just get used to how he talks I guess? I just expect it I guess?
Me the non-Irish-but-Asian guy: "What?"
Jack: "top of the morning is cringey now" Jack's company: *AM I A JOKE TO YOU?*
I love Irish accents! They’re all so nice and, ngl, very sexy
I've never believed a Youtuber more than Jack. ;)
The t thing is true, my mam could never tell whether I was saying Irish class or Art class
You just scream, that’s why it’s hard sometimes to understand you 😂😂
Idk why but it reminds me of a Norwegian accent haha  Like...slightly
*M U S I C  H U H*
im british and that "kerry" woman sounds more british then me
Jack is *KINDA SUS* that the whiteboard behind even says it.
The irish want ya back sean
That’s not brad pit
I was gonna go to Ireland this year but.......a Thing happened..
11:05 oil-rend?
Also omg Sean mentioned Skibbereen, (I live right near where the 2 rowing lads live)
Jack: There’s a lot of examples of people trying to do Irish accents that don’t have an Irish accent, and it sounds absolutely dreadful.  Ethan: **nervous laughter*
My favorite movie of all time is " The Nephew"... Love it... Yall should go watch it
As someone who is already hard of hearing, this was just a whole web of confusing
"YEAH EAT SHIT FRANCE"  France: "hon hon hon baguette brune"
i heard jack doesnt read comments                jk i know he does
SEÁN MACINTHIGHITTH
You actually mentioned Ballyhaunis you legend❤️🤣love your vids jack
I could understand him, not entirely, but enough. The guys after the fellow who had his sheep get stolen, perfect clarity.
Seàn: is translating for us  also Seàn: translates some parts in a heavy Irish accent I cant understand
I’m here
Can anyone translate what Jack translated for me?
As an Italian, I 1000% agree that Irish accents ARE the sexiest 😍🥰       (Also partly Irish)
Ive watched jack for too long that I get confused what is an accent and what is Irish accent
Bottom of the evenin to ya
It's like when people try and imitate a South African accent... Like I live here and I dunno what that sounds like
I'm pretty sure Brad Pitt wasn't playing an Irish person but someone of the travelling community, like a Gypsy
If you wanna watch an Irish/Scottish show watch peeky blinders it’s about a gang back in 1960s it’s really good and me and my dad love it
I love the farmer... I understand about 4 words hes saying 😂
Irish man translates irish
So in Leverage (the best TV show BTW) there's a Rashomon ep and Sophie's accent devolves into absolute gibberish in some characters' recounting of the story...anyway that's what these accents sound like to me.
I have a potato farm behind my house in minecraft
Why d'you have to end it when he was about to do the Donegal accent just... why
I love it
Does that school boy remind anyone else of G-man?
I saw one video where a guy wanted to speak but he was Irish.....  Aryaryaryaryayr
bro i love every  vid he post i just love it thank you for the memes jack
I love different accents, it's so fun to try to understand that sheep guy talking.  This happens everywhere right? Those parts of the country that have such a thicc accent that you have to be paying attention to understand
2011= Sean trying to hide Irish accents 2020=VERY LOUD IRISH NOUSES!!!
Irish people making their accents bizarre so other people won't understand their secret talks
Yeah the Sheep farmer sounds just like my Uncle Timmy who is also from South Ireland. Dude the South Irish accents they can be the thickest chit you've ever heard.
My god this was funny lmfao
who would've thought you only needed to learn hard irish accent to speak the alien language.
I only understood  "It's not thar difficult a boo boo Jägen"
5:32 Translation: It’s a beautiful Monday. Sure it would be bright out and anyone could go up to the mountains at night sure. Well there was forty five sheep missing Mike and the lambs were with the sheep’s it’s come, it’s coming out to be nice for me to be out on my bike, sure they’d be about for nothing. What I heard and I’m Irish
Yeah Jeff What the fuck.
I feel like id have a better chance of understanding them while they are speaking Irish
These people are so Irish that even the computer who makes the subtitles can’t understand
this needed to be an hour vid!!!!!!!!! lol
Sean: " we Irish are a different breed." Everyone thinking: (inbreed)
hey sean could you keep that  sokka  look i would apressiate it btw love your vids!
Sean the last Vowel Bender
I clicked this video much faster than I was born
As a Irish person i can confirm that every county has its own accent.
hi jack
This video was definitely fun Sean, I really liked it.
When jack said slow down my video started buffering
I'm irish the only thing is that I don't have the irish accent and love your vids man
Yess! Love Gerard Butler! And your accent ❤️
5:30 sean just played a guy talking in a completely different language and thought we wouldnt notice
As someone whose native language is not english, I'm very confused.
My grandad sounds like the sheep farmer so i understand him
Especially Robert Sheehan
I’ve been waiting for his take on this movie 🥴
Brad Pitt got that role because he couldn't do an English accent to play Turkish, which he was originally auditioned for.
how the heck is Sweden on place 7. xD
Is it weird that I understood everything before jack translated?
“Brad Pitt you’re lucky you’re gorgeous”   I felt this one 🤣
I would @ tempest in this but it's a youtube video 😔
This was fucking HILARIOUS 🤣
Guy: "boysnas boynaa couldbefonbon anyonec monofoo noght"  Jack: "There was a full moon out and it was real bright, so anybody could've come out and taken it"
that"s funny im 50% irish and my accent is not like that.
Like n Subscribe for big pp
This is such a funny vid
Dude the fact that sean could just effortlessly decode that enochian beings angelic noises blows my mind
Sean should do welsh accent next
Yes the scenery lots of fields and cows
Tbf in Snatch, Turkish does explain when we first meet Mickey, that he speaks "pikey".  "Its not Irish and its not English, well its just pikey".
That scene from Hot Fuzz is fantastic!
1:48 yes jack you made a video about this it’s called I LOVE NATURE!!
only i can understand is sheep
my literal favorite content is people judging people trying to do their accents
I'm from kerry and the last one is very accurate
Táim ag foghlaim Gaeilge an bhfuil sé seo á dhéanamh agam i gceart?  I’m learning Irish am I doing this right? Is what I said can someone confirm it’s right-
hey jack, say whale oil beef hooked in a thick irish or scottish accent
I want to learn your language Jack
If you don’t say Mir your not irish
Eating a cupcake while watching jacksepiceye
No way in hell is that even English let alone an accent in it
Call me kevin is fuming right now
What u think about rubberross's accent
That's a rad Irish pair of lads!                                                    -Jacksepticeye 2020
Y’all think Irish is hard try freaking Glaswegian!
I love a woman with a strong Northern Ireland accent.
Brad Pitt be spiting faster than eminem
Christopher Walken is a great actor, but when he pulls off that Irish accent I cringed a little bit.
I love dis vid bru
I love how videos hes self conscious of he always says “I don’t know what this video is”... I liked it DONT worry lol
Froshbutt
wait am i the only one who can under stand the Irish man at 5:06
I have been here since around 1,000 subs
If it still existed, this would be a great time to cut to Unnus Annus
"Frostbut"
My favorite thing about Brad Pitt's accent in Snatch, is that it's purposefully indecipherable for audience and characters alike. Guy Ritchie caught flak from Lock, Stock, and Two Smokin' Barrels from characters having accents that were hard to understand. So he made Pitt's accent ridiculous and impossible to understand to sort of poke fun at critics, and yet, critics thought it was pretty spot on.
If you get drunk.. are you this hard to understand ? Lol
also please do some more vr and please do more watchdog legions
Thank you for this! 😁😁 Love Irish people!
me: i think i'm pretty good at understanding english no matter the accent "Irish farmer lose their sheep mad accent" :  * Existis* Me: 👁️👄👁️
Incomprehensible Irish accents. Even though they are speaking in English. I may not be a westerner, but my English is good enough cuz i grew up speaking English.
Why does the second one sound like an Irish man tryna sound like an Irish man?
“ whut da fuk jefr”   12:50
*Jack speaks in thicker Irish accent*  I like your funny words magic man!
Irish: FAAAAHHHRTY FIYEEVE SHEEP!!!
See also: Slavic people  listening to actors butchering our languages or even better, speaking three different languages at the same time, but the bad guy (always the bad guy) is identified as a "russian".
Hey jack, can ya please start to upload everyday like you used to do..?                                  You are a stupid to click read more......
Imagine asking a Irish person to speak English.
Brad Pitt is doing the best Irish impression any of us Americans are capable of, lol
I have like 5 irish friends and I can confirm that they all sound wildly different from each other. Some are soft and some are absolute blenders of an accent. It's a fun time. 😂
I was working in tourism for couple years and I speak English pretty well, but once I met older couple from Ireland with accent I´ve never heard befor ... it was really mindfrick, because I knew they were speaking English and I should understand them but at the same time I just wasn´t able to .... they were really lovely though and laugh about it
me : *remembers when unus annus tried to do irish accent and Mark's sounded like french*
"In Ireland we make fun of each other" I wish the rest of the world could do the same (I mean twitter)
Jacksepticeye Is such a great motivation for me on my youtube journey,I am glad I was motivated by this man
Your accent is the absolute best Sean
I don't think anybody ever noticed this but...              Jack has shiny eyelids
But milk gud
i love how i go to all of the areas like skibereen pretty often XD also fuck off cork people don sound like tha
When Jack goes into ireland: Jack: I'm sorry... Ireland: Defeck you duin ere?     idk if thats how you say it in a irish accent but yes
“i wanna see how many of you can understand it”  me, a bilingual, suddenly feeling like i have never understand english in my entire life, and even starting to doubt my knowledge of portuguese
This video summoned a pint of Guinness on my desk
Those olympians, the Irish versions of 8-BitGaming.
Watches in 2x speed: WTF is happening?
This video made me laugh so hard it was great. Keep up the good work jack
🥔SPUDS🥔
First
Sean's accent is the greatest one. Also thanks for creating this video and sharing this content with us.
i'm pretty sure brad pitt wasnt doing a irish accent he's just having a seizure
Sean isn’t even Irish though
so in ireland, more south you go, the less you'll understand them
Funny thing is Jack sounds better doing a Christopher Walken accent then Christopher Walken doing an Irish accent
I like when he translates the heavy Irish accents. I feel like I'm learning a secret that no one else knows.
Don’t look at the screen at 3:07. It’s very fun not knowing what anyone is saying.
8:00 I'm just gonna say that the lad saying frostbit was actually faked
"Why don't they just hire Irish actors?" - Jacksepticeye being a genius!
I really want to know if Jacksepticeye knows Mini Ladd,if they do I’m curious of them playing Minecraft
ok
What is your favourite soulsborne game?
Okay, that schoolboy said "Frostbutt." And you can't tell me otherwise. I *live* in this country, Jesus.
I’m sad that he didn’t watch the video strongest Irish accent in the world
Fellow Irish people ASSEMBLE.
*Ireland intensifies*
10:49 jacks face is priceless
It’s like a boomhauer accents (witch exist) super thick southern accents, that unless you know the accent well, your as lost as I am now watching this video of a man loosing his sheep.
hey i love your vids they help me when times are tough they make me happy keep doing what your doing please
Please tell me Seán has used some of these pick-up lines before
I have some hearing loss, but love Sean's accent. I understand him well without my hearing aid.
If you can remember what hurling is you will like him
no one can do it unless your born with it like you are jack. im born with i dont what accent im born with but it is not an irish accent i will say that. also 3 youtubers i know have british accents which is dantdm thnxcya and ldshadowlady
When is there going to be a meme time video and ya irish is very very good
Gwan Ireland!!!!! Fair play Seán, you’re a great representative of the parish
I actually wildly dislike our accent Edit: Take back what I said but still hate the Aldi ads
yeet
Not time as in werk  Thyme as in herp.     Aight fam
Jack pls if u read this just know that u have made me happy so many times whenever i feel down i watch ur vids and i love u so much pls keep up the happy atmosphere
I am Scottish so I can relate to this cringe lol
Were as us English run through fields of wheat 🌾
Irish people : Ahh I can kinda understand what they are saying Me : *CONFUSED SCREAMING*
I'm American, but my grandparents and one uncle(and his kids) are/were Irish. I was fun visiting them in Cork, but it is so hard to understand them as well as everyone else. My God. Plus, they were thrown off by me having a slight accent from having lived in America's South my whole life. I got a bit of a southern drawl.
500,000,000,000,000$ for this man for being correct
They should've cast you tbh
Plz play more beat saber Jack
I... I didn't know Brad Pitt was supposed to be irish in snatch...
I could kinda make out that one accent for the farmer. Maybe it's because my family originally came from ireland? I have no idea
DO MORE OF THESE.... THIS WAS HILAROUS
Jack should make a Duo Lingo for strong Irish accents
I have this stupid dream, that Sean could see my Saturday is Memeday videos I started doing as a tribute to him! At least the first one. I want to make this world a  little happier,  and help other out as Sean helped me with his videos. (not self-promoting, I'm practicing my English at my channel, might be a little cringy to watch but really want Sean to see it... if you wanna go see my videos I warn you, my English is not perfect but have to practice it to make it better and have no other than the camera to do it). Pd: And could LAUGH at my accent too probably although I'm not Irish (I wish I could be Irish tho, love the country).
E
It sounds like he said "frost butt".... Which I definitely don't wanna be getting.
Irish gang
idk why but I'm Italian and can understand Irish accents 😂
JACK
I’m not in a Irish person myself but I can kind of tell they’re trying by Shawn’s reaction
If irish was the sexiest accent then what's English(BIG BRAIN TIME)
Play with nogla brian
I know that they're speaking english but my mind can't comprehend what they're saying at all
hi dad
This takes me back to when Unus Annus did the accent vid and Seán made a cameo
As an American I will speak for all when I say "What did he say?"
my English teacher is Irish, when she talks to us we all sit there confused, SHE TALKS FAST AND HAS A HEAVY ACCENT we don't understand anything @_@
Hi
I ordered some top of the morning coffee beans and hot chocolate about a week ago and it still hasn’t arrived. When should I expect them.
Jack: "There are so many accents in ireland, there isnt just one." Also Jack: "She sounds british", when there are 3 countries and about 1000 different accents.
5:53 there’s an accent there? That’s sounds normal to me😂
i love ireland, never been but i love it.
When Swedish is up on the top, you know that list is false
🇺🇸I mean I’m not Jacksepticeye or Sean but I don’t think that’s  Jack accentCan you tell I’m American besides the flag
Funny how I literally had to watch that woman explain how to do "irish accent" for english class.......all I could think of is "I've never heard an irish person say OIRLAND"
i absolutely love listening to the accent in Derry Girls
Where is man eater
Are you wearing makeup?
Kevin tried a while back to understand that farmer and he didn’t have a clue what he was saying
Petition to get Sean to watch wild mountain thyme and review it
The funny part is that your irish and even you can’t understand it.
It was just great seeing Jack really laugh and giggle with the people of his homeland , I lived in Ireland for three years and it made me ashamed to be English I loved the country and the people they are the best in the world.
Do Scottish next I donnie imagin even you would understand
Disclaimer: this video contains bad Irish accent
I'm northern Irish and my accent is super strong so any time  I talk to someone from America they almost never know what I'm saying
is it just me or do irish accents sound oddly similar to jamaican accents??
Try to understand a Newfoundlander accent and GOOD LUCK 👍🏻
welcome to ireland Bird: *HJONK*
I'm usually pretty good at understanding accents but that farmer had me like... "DUDE WHAT!?!  Were there any words in that?!"
i enjoyed this so fucking much. omg
My favourite Irish lads to listen to besides yourself, are Sir Stevo Timothy and Artifexian. check em out
When you realize st.Patrick isn't even irish
With Jack, the more Irish people are around him, the stronger his accent gets
I could not understand that farmer with the sheep at all! I couldn’t tell u one word he said! But the Irish accent is the sexiest accent of all! I need to go to Ireland! ASAP y’all have good looking men and a sexy accent! ❤️😍🥰
Wow, the Cork accent is very sexy. The others are fun & cool too, but Cork is my favorite
I couldent understand anything the farmer was saying
That’s not English that’s gibberish
Im starting to think that chile is the spanish ireland
jack:DRINK MORE MILK BITCH  me: (chokes on milk)
Any accents are _interesting_ for me.. especially, this YT video that I've just heard/watched. 😁🍀
"Irish es the sexiest accent in the world" Me: yes it is, scottish too.
God I LOVE BEING IRISH!!!!
Is it a problem that me (a Canadian with a Scottish background) can understand some of these quite well. And even have my brain re interpret them as very heavy Scottish.
flower ➡️ fler home➡️ herm
watching you’re video to calm down from a bad panic attack, it started at 12am and now it’s almost 4am 😅 wish me luck
Is it odd that i understood all bar the farmers accents and even that one i understood some sentences? that kerry werent an irish person at all, at all
as a Canadian whose ancestors immigrated from Ireland I'm jealous i don't have this accent. would have loved to hear how my ancestors sounded  im assuming they sounded like some of these clips, this was awesome. thanks for sharing this sean!
Loved the video!
Can we all take the time to just to compliment how *BEAUTIFUL* his eyes are? :)
19:52 That's Blindboy! He's really famous here now, started doing comedy songs but now he has his own podcast where he talks about politics and the economy and stuff but still makes it really funny.
To me, it sounds like arabic for some reason
is it easier to understand the welsh being Irish?
Now I'm curious what Seán 's Irish accent is
im 12 percent irish and understand crap
Me an Irish person with a light accent .                                              but it gets very heavy when I get angry
There are 3 levels of Irish accents: 1: Polite and interesting to listen to 2: Slightly loud and sound angry occasionally 3: Ih taek ta sheep on usbsydhebdirbhrud dhdbdh
I am more of a murrrr not a mirrrrr
HOW DO YOU UNDERSTAND THATDKWNDKEMS
"Holy god" We have reached a new level of praise
*UP IRELAND* 🇮🇪🍀😂❤️
fun fact that probably no one cares about thyme in Arabic is زعتر (zaatar)
I love accents especially English and Irish. My grandmother was born and raised in England. Jack I love your content but I love your accent more. I can listen to you all day.
"Yeah, I'm a vowel bender"
My Irish CDN teacher be like : “ giv me de tamn fown before I send ya up TO (a thicc T) de principils ofiss ya wwwweeakkling”
they arent even bad accents they are just strong they are all understandable
I was fortunate enough to travel round Ireland for about 10 days a few years ago. Not only is the country f***in beautiful, I met some of the loveliest, kindest, most welcoming and friendly folk, with incredible accents!
My brain through out this video: I LIKE YOUR FUNNY WORDS MAGIC MAN
Sus
“Start drinking more milk bitch” had me dead 💀 lol
When ever I think of irish accents I don't think of  *mmmm sexy*
Looks like Sean is being *Blunt* about Emily's accent
John Sharpson, ole Sharpy on the accents video at the end I think... sounded like him. 😁
See every time you do one of these my Monaghan accent get like 10x stronger
Go back to Irlind if you miss it
Irish accent is refreshing for some reason...
Throw back to when Unus Annus tried the Irish accent and Jack just completely roasted them
thank God we’ve moved past the among us videos
"its like mi with 15 'R's. mirrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
I only disliked the video so we can have 69 dislikes but I really really love the video  Keep up the good work
Fecking love it
I got so confused thinking he reacted to these b4 how dont u remember them then realised callmekevin reacted to them not jack
If Yur one is used for "that woman", then what's used for that man??
My family is irish, and i can only understand like every other word of the herders accent 😂
Irosh
Ireland!
I NEED MORE.  This was hilarious.. Thanks for this Seán.  I needed me a good giggle.. And the greatest accent is obviously yours my darling..
Jack dont apologizes for your accent
Pls do more video like this!
Jack should make another drumming video      Like so jack can see
The one with Christopher Walken was pretty bad but If you want to see a real SH%T show you should take a look at a movie called Far and Away.
Irish is basically the thickest, most southern Bavarian dialect, but in english
10:16  That concerned Dad: "Music you call it. MUsIc?"
Hahaha favorite video!!
fartyfive??? damn thats a lot
I actually like the video but i saw the opportunity to be dislike 69 and took it 👍
Laughs in Canadian
at least jack loves the Kerry accent
16:07 the smile that disappeared from Jack’s face
Bro I thought I was watching anime when he went into the guy with the sheep 😭
This is probably the best type of video to have posted on my birthday 😂
Well atleast jack knows what that one dude is saying
Jack, Jack, Jack. You know we all love your accent the most XD
My favorite old Irish saying: Everyone's crazy 'cept me an' thee. An' sometimes... I'm not t'sure bout thee.
When you can travel again, I'd like to see you hang out with the lads on the Try Channel.  Even an episode because I'd love to see you try Everclear sometime!
you always give me so much serotonin it's incredible
KINDA SUS!!!
How are you doing today?
this is like watching old cartoons you saw as a kid and you finally understand what they're saying
U wouldn't miss the rain
Jack: “hmm yes I understand.”   What I heard: ahtheydhsheepajdbdudbdog
jack: laughs me: ur offending me countryyyyyyyyy noone: ...........
Could you react to other countries accents plz
For the Snatch clip with Brad Pitt, in the field, I actually personally know someone who was an extra in that clip, he's the guy standing next to his left shoulder, with the short hair cut, not the long haired guy with the beard.
Do Irish actually say wee laddie or is that a false stereotype also
I’m from cork and I have no idea what the farmer was saying
Hello there Jacksepticeye
Honestly, you have a great accent Seán but Daithi.... my goodness. I think his accent is the best thing.
Alternate title: jacksepticeye laughs at his own breed for 21 minutes
More of the Irish accent pls
I can't drink milk asshole, I'm lactose intolerant.
Jack is the human version of an Irish stereotype
Hmmm... "Stab City" sounds a little sus...
Hey Jack, just wanna mention, I live a few minutes from the fields that the Wild Mountain Thyme was filmed, so yes, Christopher walkin had a pint in our town, cheers lads
Irish sounds like everyone is drunk, turns out I'm Irish all along!
Some bits I understand, other parts are literal gibberish 😂
I feel like everybidy has forgotten about Northern Ireland 😂😂🇮🇪
I can do a Irish accent I think it's good and I love the movie Snatch I've watched it like 30 times
Jacksepticeye has a Boston accent
Much love man loved the vid btw I’m subscribed lol
Irish wristwatch
Ive never had too much trouble understanding Irish accents. The farmer was a bit difficult but i got the gist of it though. I think some of the toughest are thicccc Scottish accents.  Also, do you think that when you hear people do Irish accents, it just sounds different because you are Irish. (hear me out on this) As if when I hear my own voice outside of me talking it sounds wrong? I have heard someone bash an Irish accent, yet what the person said was spot on and sounded exactly the same. Hearing things from a 3rd person perspective may not be the same as hearing it from a 1st person perspective? idk. I know what I am trying to say, just may not be coming out right. I am for the most part scottish and irish. Heavier Irish than scottish. Maybe that is why i don't have as much problems, or maybe because i watch many Irish and Scottish movies or shows when i can.
the kerry lad just sounds like me grandad, i understood most of what he was saying, but when me grandad is drunk not even god can understand that shite
This is offensive to me I’ve got a letter Kenny accent and a Carn accent I live at the top of good old Ireland except me surname Morrison is originally from Scotland then passed down to The English and to Letter Kenny and my name is Irish me so yeah me accent gives me away a lot but Sean is stronger like me teacher
I didn't know i needed jack to translate. Thank you jack
I wanna learn Irish Soo I can impress this Irish girl
I hope Dani sees this video
Is Jack alright? Seems to look like he hasn't had enough sleep by the colour on the sides of his eyes
😂69dislikes
I thought Wild mountain thyme was like an film set in the early 1900 but it’s not, seriously the country side is not that bad
The sheep farmer has the most interesting accent by far. I'm so glad Séan translated it for us. 💚🤍🧡
i enjoy the fact that we get 21 minutes of irish gibberish we mostly don't understand
I was sort of expecting this to just be a reupload of 2 men 200 accents from Sean's POV
I... Did not understand a thing in this video
Bit sad he didn't recognise the rubber bandits reference at the end
I love all these types of videos
Sean: Eat shit Italy! Me an italian living in Ireland:   👁👄👁
5:25
From were I am from in Tipp we do not the letter T at the end of a word
it's my first time watching jack at 720p60 and it's wierd Hahahah
I love being from Cork, we get so much fame. I still don’t know why yer one from England was there from Kerry tho
Well at least I can say that after each video I could understand more and more of it...
I love how he is just translating the heavy irish accent into a slightly less heavier one for us
So you went to college in GTA V
10:43 that’s not how you say “I” in English it’s how you say it in American though
Oh gods, this reminds me of whenever my friend tries to imitate any accent and he thinks he's good, but really no, no he's not... I can do a decent American southern accent, but I honestly would not try to imitate any other accent out of fear of coming off racist
It literally almost sounds German
They say coffee cool too
if we are soo bad at doing irish accents teach us how to do one
ok so I couldnt understand the farmer, but everyone else was fine
To the one who’s wanting hate comments, GO SOMEWHERE ELSE! It’s annoying!
I feel this way about English accents too like seriously where I am, go 2 hours one way and 2 hours the other you’ll get completely different not only accents but slang too, it’s mental
Pewds: Talks swedish when he started Youtube  Jack:Doesnt sound like a irish man but.. when he starts talking irish...he'll prove you wrong
My favorite thing is when Jack tries to do an Irish accent AS AN IRISHMAN WITH AN IRISH ACCENT 😂😂😂
my name is just undeniably VERY irish i come from a EXTREMELY irish family (dublin and donegal) i have an irish passport.... yet i cannot do an irish accent 🥴 i know i’m a shame! i unfortunately grew up in manchester so i got stuck with that accent instead 🙃 hahahaha
Im from dublin. Jesus christ i cannot   believe the fucking accents
Got to go to the toilet and do the big job😂
Irish accent go brrr.
i dont drink milk i drink energy drinks and coffee
I was almost wondering if I’d have to deal with the pain that is Gerald Butler sounding like a cartoon leprechaun.
Oi ladd fretch me dat potato over there why dunt cha
Wow this was bludy enjoyable
early
Did he not recognize blindboy at the end
0:40 i should go back to bed. i'm so freaking tired.
69 likes lmao
I’m over 90% Irish but my accent is shit
"M-I and 16 R's" it's so true 😂
Hell yeah, I like it hwen you talk about irish accent, (that's what I notice with your irish accent Jack, every word that starts with 'wh' at the front you like to change the position of the 'h' to be in-front of the word, pls correct me if I'm wrong) anyway, love your vids man 👍
“Ahh shur jayses I’m an Irish man “ ☘️
My poor Italian/Canadian heart
30 minutes and 2 minutes late
I want more of these videos
For a german myself I can say that irish men have sexy accent 👉👈
I guess having non-irish ppl portray Irish ppl like that first one is a form of cultural appropriation?
yes finally he saw that video..
jacksepticeye speaking irish ☘️ for 21:13 minutes
This makes me soooooo happy!!!! I was recently watching a clip of your stream where you broke down the Irish accent and pulled up the video of the cork boys :))))))) <3
I tripped in the grass and once saw a clover. I am Irish now
I'm actually surprised that I managed to pick up quite a few bits of the real thick accents. I am welsh though so I'm used to mumbling and trying to decipher each conversation I guess lmao
Brad Pitts doing a Kerry accent
NOW THIS LOOKS LIKE A JOB FOR ME
Haven't you reacted to this like a few years ago?
Love the vid my YouTube channel is flipping king gaming too I got 13subs
The old man sounds like he was talking German
I drink a lot of milk thank you very much
Brad Pitt sounds like a Conor Mcgregor with brain damage
Your accent sounds normal to me Seàn The rowers are normal accents too btw
My mom was going back to bed and Sean said " go back to bed child, start drinking your milk bitch!" My mom said your friend is rude. LMAO.
6:36 when you mentioned the Hot Fuzz scene, I knew exactly who you meant and I just started laughing harder cause that's what it feels like! But, at the same time, I think with a bit of studying and constant listening to gets easier to hear through those accents. At least, that's my personal experience, but at the same time, I'm always also in need of subtitles xD
Jack the lad with a bag is a reference Rubberbandits :P i.e. Blindboy Boatclub and Mr. Chrome
If I don’t see ya through the window I’ll see ya through the week
All my friends when they do an impression of Irish people are like HEIRISH FAWK SHITE POTATO and that’s their whole impression
jack watch Boondock Saints - Norman Reedus with an Irish accent
Southern English - Lack, Northern English - Luck, Irish - Luck
Jason Statham! Awesome!
Maybe you say 'your one' for a woman because of bean in Irish? It would aspirate and sound sort of like 'one' in a few accents (do bhean).
If Irish be the sound of love speak on  If you understood that reference comment
pog
I feel like.... The Irish accent is so harsh and strong... Like WE CANT UNDERSTAND THEM but... They can  understand eachother??? Or at least for the most part? I feel like at that POINT it just becomes a new fuckin language 😂
Petition to have Jack and Daithi have an Irish Off
that sheepfarmer almost sounds scouse
Your Irish accent is very subtle actually
I met a woman with an Irish accent and I fell in love with her the second she spoke
This was a good video but dont let this distract you from the fact that bungee gum has the properties of both rubber and gum
I'm a big fan of "oireland" "EYERLAND"
Fait nd begora me laddie like topa da mor'n
I definitely know how easy it is to slip back into my accent when I'm around people with the same accent But when I'm around people who don't understand the accent, i immediately switch into the general US accent lol
I am good at English but fooking hell, can't understand a thing. Laughed my arse off though
You what Jack???
I heard the trailer on the news 😆 😂
I thought us sctts had a extremely strong accent but that farmer is something else
Yeah Jack, Irish people are built from all the spare parts that real people didn't use. That's why you all drown yourselves in booze and religion.
i was having such a stressful morning until this
The 2016 silver medal winners look like everyone's favorite humble gay dads.
Kinda wanna hear Seán's opinion on Matt Mercer's irish accent on the recent Critical Role episodes, just cause he knows him. It's a very light accent and it sounded okay to me but I'm not irish so idk
Jack keeps bitching about the sub/not sub graph when he's been using the shit out of clickbait for over a year now. Naturally people come in, watch a video and not subscribe. Nowadays we click on some videos without knowing if it's a game (and which one is it at times) or a different video. I also feel like a lot people are subscribed but don't watch a lot of his content nowadays. But then again this is just an opinion and nobody here asked to hear/read it.  Have a nice day, folks :)
PLAY PIGGY IN ROBLOX NOOOOOOW
Shur look shur listen what can you do when you live in a shoe
its like understanding a toddler. you have to be around them for a while or just be the mom to start to understand
The Irish have their secrets......
Irish IS the sexiest accent in the world. There's no debate there.  Edit: I'm from the Northern United States and when I was a teen I traveled to Tennessee A couple friends I'd made thought my "accent?" sounded odd compared to theirs but we were younger so 🤷‍♀️
2:19 He had a ROCK. Tied to his NECK! Oh my god I laughed so hard.😂
you only have an accent this thick when you're playing with your Irish bros
I love being from Kerry and understanding all the old farmers. It's like knowing a secret language.
Got a Snoop Dogg ad, so I watched it the entire way through :)
Im early (kinda)
Jack do you miss old jack with the top of the morning if you want to laugh tip my hero crakadamia 9 to 12
I love how seàn translates english to English lmaoo
Man, waching this right after waching the pewds and ksi vidio with the british accents, thats an emotional rolercoaster
i’ve gotten so used to jacks accent like i be forgetting he has one
I mean they cast Jamie Dornan... He's from Northern Ireland... so kinda close to a real Irish accent......   🤷‍♀️
oh woow  i have a arabic accent even though i am india
I’m Irish and I’m proud I can understand most of this
I know someone from Cork!! He's a pianist/musician... from a long line of musicians!!
I can't even understand heavy american accents ;-;
Vowel bender lmao xD
Can I be your friend?
I think it's just difficult to understand sometimes, because some people don't take a breath when they talk x'D
Kevin wants to know your location
It sounds way more like they are trying to speak like a Scottish person than an irish
I just now noticed on the white board, It says "Kinda Sus"
Eef
Trying to be irish be more like trying to be Arnold Schwarzenegger XD
I grew up on The Commitments, Billy Connolly and the late Sean Connery.
Me: watches this video Also me: sorry I don’t speak potato
Guess Aisling Bea's from Cork then?
2 Men, 200 Accents... Anyone?
farty five            WHAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
He's speaking the language of the gods
I’m Irish and I couldn’t understand the farmer properly. I could hear every 4th word maybe
Seán: Irish people don't say "Top of the mornin"  Also Seán: *wears his Top of the Mornin' coffee shirt*
I'd be interested to see an Irishman's reaction to a Newfoundland accent—they have very similar features
Ah, I see the problem here Sean. It’s actually “the world’s sexiest ACCIDENT”!
You shawn you should play a game called crossout it has virtually limitless creativity please trust me
:) me likey a potato :)
pure knacker accent off pit
Just saying Hello, feel free to say Hello too.
I love when you post these types of videos Sean. You are at your best when you are reviewing funny Irish stuff.
Walken looks weird with a beard.
*this is a fantastic video... gotta love da Irish :-D*
The farmer dude probably turned into a warewolf that night and ate his own sheep.... It was a full moon after all
cant believe i’ve been watching since 2013– it’s amazing to see jack’s growth since then.  i was around 6/7 when i started to watch. i’m now 13.
"You're like an Irish coffee, hot sweet and you make me jumpy"  **top of the morning coffee intensifies**
The weird thing is that the irish people don't teach irish accent the british or American does  What is really going on in world???
I guessed he said "Liam Neeson" But it's actually "Lamb missing" 10/10 would translate again. Also Liam Neeson should've played the Christopher Walken's character.
Roscommon have the best hon the rossies
my grand-mum is from Cork, and listing to this video was like going/listing to a family reunion
I don't even know what to comment
I would love more videos of Jack just watching vids of THICC Irish accepts and translating some of them 😂😂🖤🖤
the farmer just souns scouse
The "how to do" videos are always the stereotypical accent so for scottish they say roll r's but we don't do it as much as people think. mabye some people do
Jack you should play rdr2 and listen to sean's accent
You should play danganronpa, it is an anime murder mystery type of game. It’s really fun and there are 2 more games after the first one if you like it!
i cant fake a accent at all- its too hard for me i guess
Did he just say Fortnite 6:49
It wasnt in the video but the west Clare accent is by far the best
*this reminds me of a YouTube channel a couple months ago. They’re gone now but they practiced doing an Irish accent and they showed Sean what they learned. Sean was proud of their accent.*
I'm gonna make a movie called for feck sake Kevin starring actual Irishmen
I think jack should play EFT just to see how good he would be, maybe with some good tarkov youtubers like drewski, karma or oxide so he doesn’t die
"Hop on the horse and give it a smack" Woah there buddy, ye better take this relationship a bit slower will ye.
Fun video. Can please jump back in the rabbit whole?
What county is jack from??
My accent is strongest when I'm angry or excited or playing with the bois
Anyone else notice the “ kinda sus” on the white board?
Disappointment inhales Jack
Pure gold
As a kerry man myself I still cannot understand what ur man was saying 🤣😂
Jack and Kevin need to do a colab watching Irish news and stuff 😂😂
Jack: "Yeah, Irish people don't actually say 'Top o' the mornin'"  What did you name your coffee company again?
Ya France eat it!!
The county Cork girl is the most English looking Irish woman I've seen in my life.
I love the FACTS channel!  Edit- I mean, not as much as this one of course...
When Sean paused the video to do the Cork accent, I thought the Facts video froze - I heard no difference lmfao
I need a irish hat
Your irish accent is beautiful sean because well your irish
Great idea for a video!
I've always laughed at people (coughAmericanscough) who claim they don't understand Irish or Scottish people, but i might have to eat my words because I genuinely didn't understand a fucking thing that farmer said the first time around. The second time I caught "45 sheep" and "what can be done about it? nothing". Mans accent is a madness.
*cries in 2 Men 200 Accents*
Also Jamie Dornan (I think) is northern irish and even his accent isn't good in that movie
Do you remember when Shan tried to hide his accent ?
His logic lol!
When Sean mentioned the translation scene fromm Hot Fuzz, you he literally made the same thing right in the video, love it all
Epic games
He’s not playing an Irishman, he’s playing a gypsy
Ah Sean! Snatch’s accent is brilliant, it’s not just meant to be Irish it’s meant to be traveller and it’s sooooo good
Kerry was the imposter!!
Jack and Kevin are becoming one. As callmekevin did something similar to this I think
Sad times didn't even look at any notheren Irish accents
I am supposed to be cleaning but I have never clicked a notification so fast in my life 🤣
Unus annus fans: 👁👄👁
Why are they speaking Japanese
I can understand the farmer, starts at 5:06, a bit but I grew up round North Yorkshire farmers so that may have helped a bit
They ain’t to crazy when you grow up around new found land
It’s like that one scene from hot fuzz
Tis fine jack we all have a bit of an accent
I'm Irish and this video was class
Sean Mac an Tsithigh, I only saw the word thigh
Way back when you first started YouTube and you were screaming and talking fast then + your accent,.. yeah no it was hard to understand you SOMETIMES.
Should have watched Amybeth McNulty teach Lucas Jade Zumann different Irish words it was hilarious
Hi
You should do a video with lythero
5:38 and I thought Donegal accents were bad
CHECK OUT SGT DUCKY
The guy sounds like if you put a random letters and Google translate and click the speak out loud button
Jack is Irish in general and it’s amazing he always brightens my day he’s so funny 😂
Yeh :)
😂1:32 I was VERY confused with the editing of that Irish Thyme clip!! Suddenly, the boy turns into a girl and gets on a horse! 😂
I'm Irish and I barely understand those farmers lmao
I like this jack
the pure cringe in Jack's face is phenomenal
10:42 At this part I started to make tea kettle noises
Seán should react to irish names some of them get hog wild my full name (Seán Killian Murphy) isnt crazy but some get feckin wild
Hi Sean I made a tiny bell for you but I don’t know how to send it to you please comment on this so I can send it to you
You didnt keep the tyrone accent in jack
They should've got Robert Sheehan to be in the movie
For a sec i thought that the sheep man was speaking german dutch or something like that. A fast german that id
I didnt realise it was a Spar bag, that fucking killed me
Say it with me now: 'County Cark'
Lad us fuckers down in Waterford don't really have a strong accent but then again we don't really talk about Waterford, fair dodgy it is
Jack in his Irish ascent in a video. Normal people : ???????
I really want to move from the states to Ireland but I'm worried about attitudes towards foreigners when I've visited its honestly been a bit hit or miss
Jack: laughs at the movie “that’s what we do in Ireland by the way. We just hang out in fields..” etc. Irish news: man in a field lost his sheep..
Ik! The Wild Mountain Thyme looks terrible. They should just ask Irish actors. So silly
I'm Irish and I had a bit of a hard time understanding that farmer 😂
Last night, I watched Leap Year and laughing at how awful Matthew Goode's accent was. Today, I get this 😂 gotta love how things work out
yer wan who lost theyre sheep omg thas a mad one he's not barely speaking English like
Hey Jack. I'm from Galway and what is the guy on rte saying
Ok. Im Polish and I uderstood most of them but holy fuck i could not understand a Word the Kerry ład was saying.
🇵🇭🖤
That farmers accent ......... it does not sound like english
Me being Irish-American 👁👄👁
If they don’t say it how’d it become an iconic stereotype
Think we can all agree the Irish accent had many more variables than the Welsh.
I don't know I actually think Irish accents do have a bit of a musical quality to them just based on how often they change volume and emphasis.
5:06 I thought that man was speaking Irish all this time
You should judge accents from all over the world-
As an American who studied an Irish accent professionally (I was cast as Johnnypateenmike in a stage production of Martin McDonagh's "The Cripple of Inishmaan") I can confirm that it is a devilishly tricky accent to learn. I had a dialect coach, and I listened to multiple accents over the course of a couple of months (including some of the videos that Séan showcased) to get my County Galway accent _just so,_ and even then I knew it wasn't perfect. It's been a few years since that play now, and it got decent reviews, but I doubt I could still render that accent correctly, not having practiced it in that time. It would take me about a month to get it back. Irish accents are not easy, so please, cast an Irish actor instead of an American one.
If I remember the commentary correctly from "Snatch" Brad based his accent off Irish Pikers.
My grandma’s dad, me great-Granda’s from Clare. Me great-grandma (grandpa’s mom) was from Cork. Any tips on a good ol’ Munster accent, Jackaboy?
ya the woman wasunt from kerry she was bri’ish
LOL so Irish~
Hm, I wonder where Jack got this accent? Do you think he’s American? 🤔
Well same as with the English accent too, most videos it’s like teaching people how to do a posh English accent. Where are all the other fucking accents in Britain? XD. I mean ok I know the video would be a few good hours long but we don’t all sound like the queen.
Aaaa fookin welll
The more you translate the thicker your accent gets and then it just sounds like you are repeating. Lol. We need a translator for the translator. ;) jk you are a gem.
Dey don't tink like I tink
I pride myself in being able to understand most accents. Irish accent is one which I can't... If you show me a movie in thick Irish accent you might as well show me a movie in gibberish.
Wee Mikey O'Shea, Has lost his shape, And cannot fuckin' find them.
It sounds like they are speaking backwards
ohhh god even though i'm in other country and different language im still laughing ahahahaha
the fact the jack can understand him is actually insane
Do a video on Minnesotan accents
Americans and every non Irish person watching this video including me “SOUNDS IRISH TO ME” 👁👄👁 😂😂
Poll: The sexiest accent is Irish. 🇮🇪 Irish People: *No*
The problem with this is that I can’t understand you if you’re speaking too slow. I’m not taking the effort to wait for each word to come out of your mouth. Speak faster or not at all
He don't like being having american accent and he doesn't even want to have an Irish Accent
I'm not irish and I can completely understand what he's saying with no problems, LMFAO
Some ones loosing content
hi
i had absalutly no clue what that irish dude was saying
*facts. isn’t irish anymore! The channel got sold recently and it’s all different! This is from five and a half years ago though*
No wonder why the Irish accent was voted the most sexiest.
Im from leitrim and i havnt got a clue what ur man from kerry was saying
I feel weird I could understand that accent... Maybe I was Irish in my past life.
Jack has lost his accent
Christopher Walken is probably the worst *voice* actor they could've chose. He only has one voice😂🤣
This was absolutely hilarious. It’s so fun. I hope Jack makes another video like this.
Jack should do a whole video where he lets his full accent out and uses all the slang
I'm Irish and I could only understand sheep in that whole report
The longer I watch, the more I understand
8:15 that guy looks like Gman.
Jack: *apologises for content*  Also Jack: *makes content anyway*
Yer wan who lost his sheep is the WORST kind of accent when it comes up on the listening comprehensions
Its a problem when even a Irish man can't understand some Irish accents
This feels like a Funniest Home Video minus the intro
That was alot of fun, ngl
I can see Jack is wearing a top of the morning shirt. Nice promo lol.
She calls the Irish accent music, I call it drunk fighting words
im british and i can say that i do not sound like kerry, shes a london gurl
There's a baking channel name "Bigger Bolder Baking". She's Irish and I love her accent. lol
As a spanish dude, I loved it when you said "EAT SHIT FRANCE!"
I'm from Dublin 🤣 this video is great
Kindly vocal coach: "...to include the music of an Irish accent."  Sean: Press X to doubt.
The fact that he can translate that farmer’s accent is really impressive
Yea the in the south the accents are mad
That was fucking amazing i love it XD
People cannae do a Scottish one either I know how u feel
2:10 HE’S one of my favorite ACTRESSES. 😂

Okay thanks
Like this video to vote for seàn
My dog can speak better irish the the lads in the trailer and I'm irish
I could just about understand everyone but that farmer. I'm wearing headphones, but no matter how closely I listened, it sounded like he was speaking gibberish. I could understand a few words, but that was about it.
I can’t stop thinking about the gen 8 trainer
What do we want  More great irish accent   When do we want   More great irish accent
Wow to that south accent... although Newfies in Canada too sometimes 😂
Now I just want to know if he'd be able to even begin to understand the Newfoundland (Canada) accent.
As an Irishman man myself I know an Irish accent and shir not a single one there bar the last one was accurate but I understand there struggle though 😂. Love the content jack!
This was so much fun! I couldn't stop laughing
Holy jesus 2k comments in 25 minutes
My tech teacher is actually Irish and he’s amazing
“M, I and 15 Rs” made me laugh so hard! 😂
I’m Irish and I can’t even understand what the fella who lost his sheep is saying
I loved this video lmao
Do a minecraft server like rt
Craziest times
"emily blunt" thats the perfect name
i personally find the welsh accent far sexier also this is your best V.T. yet hilarious
Irish accent is like the chilean accent for latin American people
Jack trying to impersonate Christopher trying to be Irish just sounds like Arnold Swarzenegger
i was working abroad in ireland for a bit and my two favourite words in the irish accent i heard were wednesday and film(movie). the person i heard them from pronounced them like Weddinsday and Fillim.  i fuckin loved it.    i've just realized that this is probably not that interesting, but i'll leave it here anyway....
I would give my left leg to be able to do an Irish accent-
I do hope you have a license for that firearm Isdosefrdisun
*Irish listening exam begins* Irish teachers: The accent is not that hard to understand  My Irish listening exam: 5:31
I think god purposely made Irish people the sexiest people on the planet
*le me at the start of vid patiently waiting for sure ye wouldn't be long gettin frostbit!*   7 min in, am not disappoint 😂😂
being a not native speaker from that sheep clip I understand literally nothing
Jack you need to watch young offenders its on rte player and bbc it fair funny on its based in cork
Should have shown the guy with the Irish accent in the game Mafia 3 for this video.
I feel the same about the Devonshire accent... I've lived here all my life but I could never understand a fucking word my grandad said.
oh god that poor vocal coach will be ripped a new with shit like "well Jacksepticeye said..."
You were the best ascent jack
Down here in Cork we speak a few octaves higher bc we're all just happy people lmao
cap
i love irish accents ! but im french so yeah hahahah
Literally anyone: *tries to do an Irish accent* Seán: I'm about to end this person's whole career.
In Pewdiepies last demon souls video he was making fun of your accent please check it out!!!
What’s so funny is that Seán is the only person with an Irish accent I can understand.     Unless he is playing with the lads, then all sanity has gone down the drain.
Jack listing and romania
What about Unus' accent?
In last video I barely understood something. Nice video Sean but next time give us subtitles 😂
scottish accents are also among the worst for americans especiallyu trying to do as well as among the sexiest n tbh if anyone slapped my horse like the trailer theyd die lol he'll kick ur face off
In response to your question 'if you sound like that to us', no I think you articulate and vocalize very well. Probably from all your time public speaking, but eitherway your accent though distinctive is very intelligible.
I'm not irish but lived in cork for around 10 years and cant believe that the cork accent was really clear to me lmao.
Hey can i ask is bille eilish Irish?
Plot tabes
I love that Jacks doing what I do when watching a movie with southern people being played by non southern actors. Laugh yet slowly die of anguish
Too many people have done accidentally done a northern irish accent so Seàn just  went and showed how a real irishman talks
Jack went to UL or LIT !
Funniest shit i've seen all year.
I’m northern irish and I say half these words
You should react to Far and Away
Jack: *Makes video *  Also jack: it really hard to put yourself out there on the internet like that
Did he credit Kevin for the idea?
I thought this was kinda funny because me and my friends were just talking about how I get an Irish accent when I get pissed off and they can never understand it.
oof my friends try to do irish accents and- o h g o d
Finally, the randomness is back! I've missed this. All the live streams and games are fun but I've really missed the random internet videos. But hey, what ever you make is great. Keep doing you Jack!
I love a Irish accent 😍  The fast talking girl reminds me of young Jacksepticeye intros 🤣
Cork accents are my favorite! It's fun to try and figure out what their saying. 😂
“ De Urb “ i can’t understand him anymore
today i learned irish people are actually speaking english....
I always hate when people try to pronounce thing in our accent
5:30 They've a nice arse on em? Sure it was a full moon last night and anyone could have went up the mountain...
That old man one felt like he was just saying random nonsense
These accents are so focking bad
The first person I, a non-english-speaker, talked to on Gatwick airport, spoke in a thick Irish accent and I couldn't understand a thing. I had to ask him to repeat multiple times and it made me feel so bad.
i can’t believe i need a translator for *the language i speak*
I feel like you repeating all the different ones was my favorite lol
My father is a 77 year old German who always watches a little bit of YouTube videos when I have it on my tv. As I’m mostly watching English creators he listens to a lot of English but understands NOTHING. Sometimes he mutters some words he picked up when leaving me room 😂 I feel like he knows how „English“ sounds like ya know. Well.. he just walked in and stared at the tv for a a good Minute and just looked bewildered and helpless 😂😂😂😂  ofc he doesn’t know what’s going on in this video but I think he just gave up on picking up English words 😂😂
just when yer man was getting to my accent the video ended 🙂
it's so funny because my nanny is from cork and when i was younger i literally could not understand her at all but now i understand her perfectly and when my friends meet her i have to translate for them 😂😂 so i understood most of this video but i can definitely see how for some people they absolutely wouldn't understand a word
Jesus was that English or Irish or a mix??
Me, from Georgia, any time people from elsewhere try to do a Southern accent. :/
As an italian who's been insulted almost immediatly  *sad (but almost sexy as an irish) noises°
For some reason I have an obsession with all the Irish accents...
Once upon a time, because I was a big fan of an actor with a thick Northern Irish accent I'd grown very accustomed to Northern Irish accents. In his acting roles he never used his own accent though, I got used to it cause I would watch all of his interviews. Then he acted in a movie and I found out he was playing an Irish character from Dublin, so he would still not be using his own accent but I was like "oh okay it'll be fine I can understand his accent, surely it won't be that difficult for me to understand his character's accent". Maaan was I wrong. I start watching the movie, his character shows up and literally the very first thing he says is so unintelligible to me that I replay it for maybe 10 times, not being able to even take a guess at what he might be saying, and I give up watching the movie until I can find it with subs a whole freaking year later. I can still remember the sentence cause it left such an impression ahaha. I think over the years of watching Jack I have grown much more accustomed to Southern Irish accents though, I was able to understand some parts in this video, so I want to go back and rewatch that movie again sometime, to see if I've acquired the ability to understand his accent after almost 10 years ahaha
This video is so Irish i can't understand a word. (Btw im not an Irish)
Its fuckin' amazing
This is why Jack shouts. So people can understand him
Callmekevin has got to be shaking in his headphones right now
Is it just me or who else misses the comb over and green hair
Sean: shows a clip of an Irish boy running around a field  Me: oh no it's coming back-  I LOVE NAATUREEEE!!!!!!!
That Christopher Walken clip, oh my 😂
i understood most of what the old guy said
A strong Irish accent sounds like what I would imagine enchanted table language to sound like
I could understand it all, except the old lads on the news, that's a bit to strong for my ears.
It's so strange - i learned english and pronounciation mostly from jack but I still can't quite understand even a basic irish accent
All these intelligible accents and the thing I understand the least is how English was number 6 on that list
*start drinking more milk BITCH* I felt that
Jack: "I'm fucking great at this."  Me: "You're IRISH!!!!"
IM DYING 🤣😂😭😂🤣😭😂😭😭
Jack and Kevin have really light Irish accents.
Jack I robux
The man with the sheep could destroy any other mumble rapper in the world and just rap about sheep.

Well,in indonesia,we have different accent in every city,and every island has traditional languange

Ireland is like the Noord Brabant of the english languages.....
Yes
Drink milk and Jack's coffee ☕
Why does it sound like the terminator
One thing tho, how tf was scottish voted higher than french?
Being someone from Scotland I actually can understand Irish accents pretty well because some Scottish people have extremely strong accents especially where I’m from so it’s not too bad 😂
SEÁN MAC ANTS THIGH XDDDD
Sean, Check out heavy NEWFIE accents. I'm from Newfoundland. Mostly Irish Descendant. Check us out by'
Jack your not allowed back into the country. You have disgraced us. None of us say top of the morning. And we are definitely not very loud. *Ireland is more superior than all of the other countries* We are on another level. Bow down to us.
"PARK!, GARDEN!, CURTAINS!... FECK, ARSE, DRINK, GIRLS"... You wouldn't be long getting Father Ted references with an irish accent.
Bruh why does brad Pitt look like mid 90s jay kay from Jamiroquai
Cringe but in a good way😂
Being from rural Scotland, Irish accents aren't too hard to understand as I'm normally listening to heavy Doric accents day in day out 😂
I was fine until I heard tom cruise say "tell me ye like me hat".
This was way better than Biology zoom class
I'm Irish and I'm proud but tf in just laughing my ars off

Voice coach: Say "oi" for "i"; "e" for "ou"; "e" for "a" Jack: I don't know what you're talking about, Me OIrish Eccsent ois netting loike wet ye sed! (Oh gosh, writing Seán's heavily accented sentences is like writing Old French)
Hi from South Africa reackt to afrikaans

alot of those words sound almost like some french accents
^-^ <3
Im from ireland sean this is so fcking accurate i love it i laughed for hours
Loved this video sm!!!
Did I understand a word of this video? Not really Did I still watch the whole thing, laughing like an idiot the whole time? Absolutely  I definitely feel like I’m more educated on Irish Accents, thanks Seán 👍🏼
The longer I listen to these  thicc accents the more my american brain can interpret them.
Ah yes, more content
My irish language professor in uni was from Kerry 😂
Are you not Irish?

Me during this whole video: W-what? What happened tp the sheep? What did those boys do? What  are they saying?! Also me when Séan talks: Gosh I finally understand something in this whole video O_O
He's more English than Irish now. Can't even understand the Irish 🤦‍♂️
Can you put your hat on for at least one video you found it didn't you

Hi
LOL I saw this trailer and immediately chuckled at Walken's "Irish" accent. And I was going to try to ask you on Twitch what you thought of it.🤣

I loved this so much, felt like being Irish and watching this video was like being in a little club. 🇮🇪💕
Gods this was hilarious
That wild mountain thyme was filmed down here in mayo
I now need videos of jack reacting to various languages and each language gets its own video. Haha
Is it actually possible to learn an Irish accent though and not be horrible
And what about vampire from serial show “The Preacher”?
Jack: “There’s a lot of examples of people trying to do Irish accents that don’t have an Irish accent, and it sounds absolutely dreadful.”  Unus Annus intensifies
Meme that, WHAT THE FUCK JEEF
Honestly I can understand clearly and im not irish
mirrrrrrrrrrrrrrr...
Day 24 of asking jack to play maneater again
I'm Northern Irish by birth Scottish blood on 1 side German n something else on the other with a South English accent fuck me I'm a mutt 🤣🤣🤣
Around 19:14, i almost spat out my coffee because I started to laugh but yeah half of those fake Irish accents made me cringe and I'm American.
I feel like I've perfected my Irish accent because I watch jack
There is an Irish actor in the first movie. Jamie Dornan is an Irish actor so he's the only one.
I am a child. And i am offended. And i drink milk. Alot
so basically, irish people are hobbits?
Yay I love the Irish accent I wish I had it
northern norway fishermen folk has some thick accents as well. impossible to understand
No wonder why I'm attracted to jacks voice... I'm not even a girl...
I literally just watched the losing sheep video yesterday wow
*mirrrrrrrrrrrrrrr*
Okay no lie, I used the video at 10:18 to help me do an Irish accent for a Ren Faire I was in last year. And after listening to her for awhile I said screw it and just listened to a bunch of Jack's videos and honestly that helped me more than just trying to do it the way this woman taught. Not saying it was bad, it was just easier for me, personally, to pick up on the accent.
Sean: Irish people don't say that.. Also Sean: ...you can buy my Top of the Mornin coffee products below :')
now you need dragons
Watch their lips. Barely open when they speak. :D
Holy crap, that true Irish accent almost sounds like German 🤣
Bruh ur videos have gone down

That guy with the sheep is just the guy who voices the blond sutor no one can understand in brave. Lol
Snatch is the best thing ever. “Good boy Daisy” is prolly my favorite Sentence in the movie
I absolutely love this freaking video... Oh my gawd.
I'm from Meath
farmer: arn and sherpr fa;fjfd  Jack: he said that there's alot of sheep  out there in the barn but a few are missing
“I’m a vowel bender” 🤣
It's like the t's are th's and the th's are t's
Please do this again with Daithi, it would be hilarious
Me learning from Jack
1:41 why did this make me laugh so hard?
Ain’t no way that “school boy” wasn’t a grown ass man
Seán:3
UuUuUuh-huUuh..? Does any one know, what's on top of Sean' eyelids? That' make-up?
The bad Irish accidents made me lose my appetite (I was eating during this)
Come back to connacht bai
Jack translating just reminds me of that scene in Hot Fuzz where the sergeant with the dog has to translate for the farmer. Edit: Oh. Okay. He literally said that as soon as I unpaused. Well aren't I a stupid?
We watched that Irish guy with the sheep in my fuckin school
Seán also has the chart!!
I half Irish and half English and I'm soo fucking disappointed that I have an English accent and not an Irish one
I love the Irish ☘️
If you drink, it makes sense! Genius!
Jack you sound nothing like that. You I can actually understand.
7:05 yeah i can hardly understand him
County Loud LMAAAO
*Me, a non-native English speaker trying to do an Irish accent:* aAAaawwwWghHhsShh
I like British and Irish accents.

I was listening to Brad Pitt speak. I was reading what it said he said. I couldn't understand a single word. My new favorite thing.
oi mate br ish is best ACCENT
great vid
I think noglas accent is stronger than Sean’s. Not by much tho
Hey Jack I think a green top of the morning shirt would look really good
Please tell me you've watched 'Derry girls' on Netflix, it's amazing.
I bought some top of the mornin’ coffee! Very affordable and DELICIOUS 🤤
I didnt know bazzz was irish
But jack you live in the LGBT city ... sooooo gargle the white milk
I’m not even Irish and I don’t even believe this farmer is irlsh
Hey Sean I think Brad Pitt had spent 3 weeks in Ireland before he was in Snach.
i feel like i’m learning a whole different language
the first 50 seconds were fucking amazing
"Hello Becca." **Ad**
Oh wow just realized how early this came out lol love your vids hope you have a great day
The Vowel Bender 😆😆
Im irish but rarerly talk english and cant even do the irish accent i am a shame 😞😞😞
Jack i’m starving out here I need meme timeeee
Early
That guy making fun of Cork accents literally sounded like Kevin I couldn’t take it
Even the captions don't know what's happening
Christopher Walken trying to sound Irish is like Tim Curry trying to sound Russian. It sounds nothing like what they are trying to sound and is just hilarious to listen to
that irish farmer is speaking something that is far from the english language
I can't understand a single irish word...
jack i love your accent its awesome and i wish i had an accent like it
To be BLUNT, Emily probably had the best Irish accent in the entire video 😎
Youve heard people sounding irish but have you heard irish sounding not irish the awnser is yes so there was not point in reading this but I wrote it so read it pls REEEEEEEEE
It killed me when you just translated it like it was so obvious what he said. 😂
I can understand accents coming out more when you look at stuff like this. My accent usually isn’t that bad but the more time I spend around people with the same one the stronger it gets
Americans: Mirror Irish lads: Mirrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
we have the most dumbest accents :HINT: Guns with the red white and blue
LoL love it! I don't know if it's the jobs I've worked or the movies I watch but I'm good at understanding accents the only one I had a hard time understanding was the sheep guy lol!
Some of these bad irish accents just sound like drunk bostonians and it makes me feel at home
5:31 all my brain could register was possiblemightencouldamerkdosejfjdfkdoseelytra  edit: ive come to the conclusion that jack can be a translator if we ever come into contact with a foreign alien. the man can make words from oddofjdjdldkfkdjdddhd
This idea is stolen from call me kevin
AY JACKSEPTIC... EYE BRING BACK THE CLASSIC EYE INTRO PLS
omg ive been getting reccomended these vids lately
oh dude i laughed so hard... the moment Sean said "oil" it reminded me of the dude that couldn't say "e-yes" hahahahaha damn that eyes wide open expression was gold xD
No Jack. That's not how you sound. We can clearly understand what you're saying
See sean is from the east so he wouldn't understand a thick west Kerry accent like that
I feel like the bit at ~ 12:30 is true for so many places, England has so many different accents as does America, Ireland, Australia and everywhere, its so strange to see the accents that come out in films are crazy
26 mil
The less understandable the better in my book.
I feel like Sean talks like this when he gets angry at some points in any game.
I’ve been watching since the last of us
“Farty five” 😭
as someone from northern ireland, that "frosbit" clip became a meme for so long as soon as it was on the news hsdfhds

wild mountain thyme is classed as a crime
Should I be worried that I could actually kind of follow what that sheep farmer was on about? I’m not even a native English speaker.
I'm early friends!!!
I’m Scottish and I can understand what the man was saying
I’m Irish and I can understand most of what hes saying
I can't t hear the "frostbit" as "frostbutt"  Only me? Sweet
The Irish accent is as versatile as the German accent. The further you travel from north to south, the weirder the people sound.  I must know. I am from Germany and have lived for 18 years in the middle of it, have studied for 5 years in the north and now live since 10 years in the south now. I've heard some weird accents and lost my own on the way xD
You should react to the northern Irish accent
Am i the only one who misses his old outro?
"We were classified as the sexiest accent in the world."  Mhm you know it ;)
Irish Christopher Walken is Father and you can't tell me otherwise!

Irishmen: The fook is a pandemic? I gotta find my sheep!
I don’t know why but Jack doesn’t sound Irish to me anymore. As someone who also isn’t from England, I have also seemed to lose my accent. Weird world huh?
wow. i didn't know Jack could speak enchanting table
Well this video is going to copyrighted to all hell.
Your accent isnt even bad so i don't know why people put on the typical high pitched bs. You do get more irish the more you get excited or angry though

Yaaasss!! My favorite movie! Fookin piekies It’s actually easier to understand the more I hear it. I’m just an American and out of “practice “? Ha ha but I agree the Irish accent is beautiful & melodic
Fun Fact: the Dislikers didn't even have time to watch the whole video, means even they have notifications on.
Am I the sexiest accent ?!!?!?!!?? Because I’m English/Irish
Irish accents is just the white version of an Jamaican accent..but stronger
You should react to some other accents that can get thick as fuck like scouse or scottish for example
Nollaig shona dhuit Seàn!

We all know Wild Mountain Thyme is doing a terrible job at being Irish. I saw no potatos in the trailer. If Seán has taught me anything is  Irish = Potato. 🇮🇪 = 🥔
I love the Irish accent so much like if you put someone from Donegal and Kerry beside each other they sound nothing alike but are from the same country and I’m Irish it amazes me everyday 😂😂
Original Irish accent is like bitter black coffee. Jack's Irish accent is like Top of the Mornin coffee.
Well you are the only person with the most Sexiest, powerful, Gaelic gladiator, potatoe “Irish“  accent, so dw Seán
My family is from Cork I thought that wasn’t too strong lol but people struggle
Woohoo
It just feels like another language at this point, not even an accent. xD
Like in Wyoming most people don't pronounce t's
I *love* that as an Aussie with rural relatives I could get most of what they were saying.
Tree huntret and tirty tree tousan tree huntret and tirty tree
The swimmer on the right looks like Toby Maguire
The farmer sounds like crazy dave from pvz
Listen to a Newfoundland accent. It sounds very similar to the Irish due to ancestry. You won't be disappointed trust me
Over here in Ireland, we have a little town called Killenaboy. We only sacrifice girls there though.

I feel really robbed to be honest. If a job opportunity for my dad hadn’t fallen through I could’ve grown up in Ireland and had the sexiest accent in the world :(
Americans be like 10:48 did someone say oil.
The farmer's accent was so heavy, I could hear German and mandarin simultaneously when he spoke...

Well Jack, it isn't like Ireland has a proud history of theater and a current roster of good actors the caliber of Liam Neeson, Colin Farrel or Say Danial Day Lewis and Brendan Gleeson. And forget women, we've no actresses as good as Soarise Ronan.
Jack: The sexiest accent in the world. Screw you Italy! God, i can't stop laughing at that :) and the FARTy five sheep(How i heard it)
But Jack I'm tired of subscribing and unsubscribing everyday.
we are just watching Sean laughing for 21 minutes straight
I am Irish, and I could understand EVERY WORD
11:51 he says something that sounds like flare, so I’m gonna make this into when he says (in my ears) flare I’m gonna play someone shooting a flare gun
your merch i wanna get is out of stock in my size :C (small)
Ten minute gang
Irish accent really thin hard to understand if you listen carefully its When you don't you lose your mind 🤯
I was straight until i heard Sean's accent
Being from Newfoundland I can actually understand the farmer pretty good.

Froshbat must be an Irish subspecies of the the bats...❄️🦇

Bruh, I’m Irish and I needed a translation 😂

Be careful of frostbut this year

Jack: Translates English to English
I heard sheep And 45 the rest just sounds like a whole different language
I have no idea what he said
Cries in Scottish 👀😂
A generous tip:- Increasing the volume will not help you understand
I'm Scottish and i have to ask, how the hell are Scottish accents even that far up on the  hottest accent list?
Being Irish is the best thing ever
Movies that involve Irish people should just have jack play a part.
Jack, you should try playing Nier:Automata and make content out of it. Not sure if you played it before, but if you did not, go for it, it is a great piece of work (soundtracks are god tier). Attempt #21
I mean, they obviously were looking for names to promote the film instead of being accurate. :/ i mean, why hire Benedict Cumberbatch to be Doctor Strange? Why have Michael Cain play a Texas man in Secondhand Lions? They wanted the names to help sell the movie...
yer only irish when you know about the young offenders and the late late toy show (im from north dublin)
I hate the Irish accent so much, and I live here.
Ok i am from iceland and i understood like 80% of the words they were saying the other 20% was just gibberish.   (Sorry irishman)
These are the equivalent of a deep southern accent
You should just react to people speaking Irish at this point
oh i didnt even realize this video was so new lmao
"Accent's happen"
Welsh is best
the olympics one wasnt that bad, i understood it
This whole thing is really interesting to watch cus the way some of the people talk reminds me of how people from Newfoundland talk.
I swear the guy in the video about the sheep isn't speaking English
I laughed at the intro. Haven’t stopped yet
"Too bad for you Scotland." Me, who's part Scottish: Is that a personal attack, lad?
I want him to do a vid where he talks like he would around Irish friends use inv Irish slang that’d be funny
Oh wow, didn't know my accent was #2... neat lol
FIRST
I am convinced that Jack is bilingual, he speaks English and Irish both
57,949th view gang were you at?

I'm so happy you reacted to those Irish rowers. I was killing myself laughing at their Graham Norton interview
Wtf xD my teacher is american and she speaks gailge better than this 🤣🤣🤣🤣 (im irish btw)

Is the Brad Pitt thing even accurate. I’ve heard some people’s accents can be hard to understand
No one finished the video lol
Has anyone else noticed that captions are disabled for this video?
Your accent comes even more  when you are streaming along with your other Irish men... and it's AMAZING!!! I love it! :D <3
Jacksepticeye has a nice Irish accent but wheres his real accent
my cuzin also has a speach impediment
I am getting a German Shepard puppy tomorrow I am so exited.
Well my peoples accent is the scariest in the world it’s scarier than the Russian accent
The way he can translate the Irish accent that sounds like gibberish is HILARIOUS to me
Your accent has been muddled with an English accent. You sound more like an Irish American than an Irish native
I just ordered my first piece of merch! im so excited for it to arrive!

It gets worse, look up the ”Glaswegian” accent
Love your videos mate, Seriously have helped me a lot through ups and downs <3 Funny video btw :D
Me: an Irish person unable to understand a word that Irish farmer lad was saying
With even the strongest accent seán says, we scottish can still understand what the man says, such with us have strong accents way far up in Scotland 😂
I can’t believe English made it to the top 10 sexiest accents like:  “Oy mate, fancy a bit o tea and crumpets wiff me queen. 50 quid for a laff and fart out me bum. Schtewpid innit, what’s this en? Cherrio”
Lad I understand what's hes on about
This is why the English left the South of Ireland alone, they couldn't understand a word they were saying!
8:54 these 2 lads used to train down in West Cork where i'm from lmao
Wat Dublin like
I Really want to live in Ireland its an beautiful country ❤️
That lad talking about the frostbite was Rory Mcsorley
I actually understood without translating "a good dog"
I can them because im irish
I genuinely did not understand a word that old man said but apparently we both speak English
Fun fact people who say first probably haven’t watched the whole video
Why did the coffin guys dislike this video
The frostbit wee lads accent is fake... He put it on for the news lol
When he tries the fake Irish voice, at one point he just sound the guy who played the terminator. Arnold swartsenagar or whatever
i am Irish, but i am not complete with the accent... i am now not Irish
The longer I watch this, the easier it gets to understand.... What is happening?!
You meet an Irish person on there own accent not strong a group of Irish lads you’ll hear the thiccest strongest Irish accent ever with them speaking a load of nonsense 😂
"Built Differently",No,Its built different.Just different.not differently
"people who don't have an irish accent"-- Cries in Dublinner.

As a Welsh farmer I can kinda understand the mad Irish farmer’s ascent but who’s going round stealing 45 to 50 sheep, I’d be fuming
Who thought irland got the best irish accents
Conspiracy theory: JackSepticEye isn't even Irish which is why he doesn't understand it, but Sean is
Please make a video where you And kevin play AMONG US PLS , And pls make more videos og scary games
I guess its because you migrated to England.

Irish accent is the most seeeeeexxxxxxyyyyyyyyyest in the world
As a non english speaker since birth  I'm not able to hear too much of a difference in accents. Yes that's my excuse
All of jacks Irish videos: Irish accents I can't even understand
Most of this video is just how Americans view the Irish accent lmao
Brad Pitt, right in the middle of the Irish accent uncanny valley :D
I will edit this comment and make it say I changed this comment multiple times so the replys don't make sense Say random stuff In the replies to confuse people!
Thank you for translating that one clip for us! I show it to my ESL students when we do a lesson on accents to explain that not even all English-speaking people can understand each other 😂 I’ve only ever understood 10% of that
i am jamaican and my accent has a little bit of french in it since i speak creole and  i didnt know this at all O^O
Somehow I could understand that farmer 😂
wassa
For you the south have accent in Minnesota it’s the north and woo that’s and accent
jack play tabs again theres a uniy creator you can create units that you want from it and theres a new faction one off the new units in the faction is your favorite i think maybe.
i think he forgot the 45 sheep part
Oh dear... For the Irish Farmer Lose Their Sheep, Mad Accent... I kinda switch from knowing it's English with Irish accent, to thinking he's speaking Dutch... Then nodding at the end of the sentence right before my brains say "Wait, you understood anything?"   I didn't. I don't even know Dutch.
Seán dies perfect intro: “I don’t sound like that.” I mean.... I’m sorry to be the bringer of bad news....not so much anymore, but when you were trying to sound SUPER Irish...that’s exactly what you sounded like.
Jack-a-boy
that movie should’ve casted you and niall horan 😌🤝
God I live where Wild Mountain Thyme was filmed, I feel so sorry for my poor mountain, it doesn't deserve to be connected to this shit

Even Kevin couldn't translate the farmer my god. As an Irish person I understood very little
Jacksepticeye is shit. All he uploads are the shitty videos of him watching other content because he's too lazy to make his own
2:21 IS THAT GRU FROM THE MINIONS IS JACKSEPTICEYE GRU
Jeez if he can't understand it you done messed up.
I'm Irish not even I can understand this and we Irish say the some wired things
I remember that moment in hot fuzz hilarious best movie ever
Even as an american i got a good laugh out of this video. It’s great XD
Sean, rewatch Snatch. Great movie. Brad Pitt plays a Gypsy in england and they say "it's not english, it's not Irish" because they haggle and you can't understand them that way
Remember when the kids said your accent was fake
Jack will you ever play subnautica again on the new consoles?
Strong Irish accent exists Mumble rappers: Is for me👉👈
It wasn't frostbit, it was CLEARLY frostbutt. 8:16

Jack not being able to understand the irish accent *What is life at this point?*
damn brad really called that guy's mum a tart....despicable
Jack should have a translation service for everyone visiting Ireland. I feel like it should exist
The number of people commenting without watching the video completely is enormous
I can't do any accents, besides southern and British.
Noo I'm first comment pug my place
Ireland Accent:   sean:IM ABOUT TO DESTROY THIS WHOLE MANS CAREER
I don't think people in general know the crazy amount of accents on this island, you can travel a very short distance and encounter a totally different way of talking and slang words, it gets very lyrical at times too.
I'm legit laughing in amazement on how Sean is understanding and translating the hard accent one to us, jeezus.
**Flash backs to Unus Annus**
Your Irish if you watch the late late toy show
Hey Jack do you play halo?
5:32 The man is spitting bars
The wild mountain thyme was filmed in the west of Ireland in my mates house it was really cool and he makes a appearance in the movie at the back of the scene where the car is shown!!

Ok, i'm confused, i'm not a native english speaker (i'm from mexico) , but  it's easier for me to understand the british, irish and aussie accent, rather than the american accent, i can't understand it bc they talk so fast, it's incomprehensible. Am i the only one?
Sweet Jesus lads we made it on the channel!

Woww

Sean hello pin me and I will scream the meme time song in my city centre and post it on YouTube
I wonder what a Irish/British accent sounds like
That first one sounds like someone thought "Irish!" and then just went into a bad Scottish at the same time.
You should react to Maura Higgins from Love Island

I thought Alabama accent was the same as Irish 🤔
At this point, it's not an accent it's a freaking language
i just changed my mind into swedish mode and it was actualy easier to understand the first video i mean the farmer
Love waking up and immidiatley hearing Irish accents 😍
You should play this game called OneShot its a really great and meta game, meta than Undertale. And here's a tip once you start the game don't exit out of the game, just close the game. And another tip once you beat the game reset the game, and it'll get really meta.
Are... are you wearing gold eyeshadow today?
hi jackspedicey

The Irish sheep farmer sounds like Daithi if his tongue was stung by a bee

As an Irish person I have no idea what hes saying and btw yes this is the stuff on the Irish news
Kinda sus...
Any one who comments early     Bots: its free realstate  Also bots: give me hate comments
Ireland sounds fun.
Some of the accents are turning into Bostonian accents
What county are ya from jack And that is not how we talk and we all do have different acsints
💚💚
I'm Irish and I'm like the fuck are some of these accents?!?! XD XD
I love how Sean is translating for us
If your Irish you feel like your bonding with him cause you know exactly what he is talking about
Idk why but I just LOVE hearing Scottish and Irish accents. It's kinda similar to an Indonesian tribe's accent, which I am. It feels so entertaining to listen to.
You should watch Irish tik toks like Kevin did
Jack: laughs about none of the actors being Irish in the first trailer Jamie dornan: AM I A JOKE TO YOU??
Hey +jacksepticeye was just wondering cause i remember you doing SCP videos before your haitus, would there be a possibility you could continue the SCP Containment Breach series? Thanks. :P
Uu i’m early but have a good day 😎
Intro translation: STFU Felix stop doing my accent
I miss the vids with Sean and the Irish lads. That's when his accent is at it's thickest.
i swear the british isles have more accents than the rest of the world combined and yes for those who aren't big geography people ireland is considered part of the british isles despite being a very very different country
Hi :D I hope you all are having a good day.
I am early?
Good good
i am drinking milk while watching this
I know how to speak Irish but I'm have alot of Irish family but I'm just not very good at irish because I'm learning but I feel like jack,nogla,terrerisor can definitely speak flawlessly irish
JACK!!!!!! PLAY DOOM ETERNAL DLC!!!!!!
I'm abit irish but not really
4:44 Green has ALWAYS BEEN SUS!
The guy from the thumb nail isn’t actually speaking English.. right guys
Does anyone else find this cringe? or is it just me?

Wen is the walking dead saints and sinners coming back

I feel like your irish accent definitely enhances when you're playing with the Irish lads. Absolutely love it
hello
Cheese
My family is from Doolin in southwestern Ireland and their accents are so thick it’s hard to communicate sometimes but they’re all very nice people 🤣🍻
Jack: "Irish accent is the most sexiest accent in the world!" French ppl: huh?
Nobody:  Bots: OH JUST GIVE ME HATE COMMENTS ON MY VIDEO OR ELSE
And daddy he scared me. Wow jack
Jack: GET FUCKED ITALY  Me: mama Mia imma about to-a make a iriiiish pizza pie

I didn’t understand a WORD from the Irish farmer 😂
Ireland, land of the *inaudible screaming.*
hi jack i hope you have a great day
I know that you won’t see this but I have never been early I’m on online school because my family has COVID but We are doing fine And me and my brother have been watching for a long time and hope u are doing well
On my many trips to Ireland O have learned that the Irish accent can range from extremely clear to not even the locals can tell what the hell they are saying. I have run into the former more often but every few times I have run into the latter. I honestly wish I had dual citizenship like my mother because Ireland is such a beautiful country and the weather, even though rainy, seems to stay pretty temperate at times. Plus you can get really good local salmon at certain times of year if I remember correctly.
The Irish accent is legendary      And this is coming from an Irish man, who, by the way Americans, lives in Ireland
You should do your Irish accent for a hole video
jack i dont know what you mean these accents are the best you accent is the one that is bad.... duh
Nice
Good morning jack. how ya doin

It's like Arnold Schwarzenegger trying to be Irish
I'm American, but I picked up a light Irish accent from watcing Jack's videos lmao
hej jack,I have an good game for you it calld hollow knight it's a game about bugs game grumbs play this

0:23 Jack: " Get fucked, Italy" Me, an italian: *thumbs up crying cat meme*
Hey Sean! If I've got Irish in me, does that mean we're brothers? Brothers in arms. Gladiators gotta stay together.
Whoever is commenting now have not watched the video
The irish proportion law: drunk=5²⁷× Illegible accent
The pain of not understanding your own accent is the baddest thing, trust me.

I CAN DO CORK ACCENT JACK

Being an American it all sounds the same to me
"START DRINKING MORE MILK B****" should definitely become a catchphrase

I’m glad I’m not the only one who couldn’t stop laughing at the Irish accents attempts- but I did cringe a lot at it
Who makes an Irish movie and doesn't hire Colin Farrell??
Irish man 1 - saying something I don’t understand  Irish man 2 - laughing at something I don’t understand
After he said “ We were classified as the sexiest accent in the world”, I said “damn straight”. In the worst Irish accent you could ever think of.
you should listen to david boreanaz's awful irish accent ajsjs
When Sean tells you to drink milk,but you're lactose intolerant:....well....there seems to be a problem here.
Tbh.. In the Netherlands we have two separate languages.. one is actually an officially recognised one and no Dutch people can understand wtf they are saying

If i'm this early it is confirmed I haven't watched the whole video
*"Eat shit, France"*  - Jacksepticeye, 2020

Jack je taime
I’m part Irish, and part German but my German accent is more realistic, same with my British, Japanese also more accurate then my Irish which I’m more Irish than anything else, I’m just American so I have a dumb accent
Yo jack I have been watching you since happy wheels I love your vids ♥️
The Brad Pitt clip sounds almost exactly like a stereotypical Newfoundland accent

0:42 Dani stonk noises intensifies
14 dislikes in a video only 4 minutes old? I sure hope they find the love they are looking for and missing. 😬
The thick Kerry accent from the guy in the thumbnail is just how my grandad sounded - I can actually understand clearly despite being born and raised in England.  I remember a cousins birthday bringing together family from Kerry and Wicklow, with neither side able to understand each other.  There's me in the middle, the lad with a surrey accent, translating between them 🤣
I’m even Irish and if Jack doesn’t know what Brad Pitt  is saying, no one does Well Irish blood in me
I have tried many times to impersonate an Irish accent, but it always sounds scottish
F**k is this bad the Irish man can't even understand his own accent
Irish is actually the 3rd most sexiest language 😂😂
You should react to Mrs browns boys episodes
yes the bigfoot of corse and the most sexist
bro bots are so annoying there on every channel and it’s not even interesting since it’s always the same comment
im an early bio
I’ve been doing an Irish accent for a D&D character for the past year, so now I can just pull it out without thinking about it!
Your accent becomes so pronounced and vivid when you play with the Irish lads that you could be talking *actual* Irish and we'd probably understand you better 🤣
It’s the same with Scottish accents, there hasn’t been a soul who isn’t Scottish that can do a convincing Scottish accent.
Irish potatoe?
You know it’s bad when The Gaelic Gladiator himself can’t understand 😂
Plz jack you must complete the ultimate quest
CHEESE CULT
U should finish Henry stickmin  completing the mission
