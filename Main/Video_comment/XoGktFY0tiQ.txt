Come on ya boys in green !
KAMPAIIII
Love these tunes, blasting them out with a hun pub a hundred metres away! 👍😂🍀
Well done Ange and the players  🖐💯💚🍀..
I hate football why does YouTube think I'm interested in Scottish football??????. Its a load of rubbish crap and garbage. I'M NOT INTERESTED!!!!!!!
Some great goals and assists. Should've finished 3-2 for the foul on Bosun, but winning on penalties shows great character. At Ibrox as well. Bring on the weekend. When the going is this good, why stop? Keep progressing. Loved the assists for the second. Running power and touch. Perfect. 'Mon the Hoops !
Wow! ...at 3-0 it looked like it was going to finish 10-0, but the boys lost their discipline & maybe ran out of gas after that opening effort (which was impressive!), and their opps gained momentum.  ...job done in the end though 🏆
a green and white wash season
Well done bhoys 🏆🍀 My nerves were in shreds watching that 😂 Outstanding saves from Josh Clark 😳👌  Great celebrations at end and good seeing the young academy kids enjoying it too. We never stop winning 🙌 💪 🍀💚☘
Well done bhoys , fantastic entertaining game ,,and  mutual sportsmanship , 🍀🏆 brilliant 💚HH
Enjoying watching the game but the video at half time with Sean and his Mum breaks your heart God Bless Sean, his Mum, and the Celtic Foundation Sending positive thoughts and love to them YWA
Rangers always in our shadow! 😂
We’ve got good future with amazing young lads like Rocco vata , Ben summer that goalie and number 6 I think it’s kenzie
Well done to the Celtic fans too for not booing the sevco penalty takers.
They try and try but they should know their place all levels 🇮🇪🇮🇪☘️☘️
Sick of winning everything man 😂
They cannae win fk all 🤣🤣🤣
🎶 just can’t get enough
Brilliant celtic🇮🇪
We just keep winning and winning and I ❤ it
Well done young team, plenty to take away from this. Some of our attacking play in the first half, was stunning. The defence was suspect, second half and struggled at times. The history books will show another trophy, do we still have enough room?
Absolutely Superb Goalie defo man of the match for Celtic 💪🇮🇪🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🇮🇪💪🍀 HH Congratulations BHOYS
Another win for the mighty Celtic this season
bet at every level 😂.
