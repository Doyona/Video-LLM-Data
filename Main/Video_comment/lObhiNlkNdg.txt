3:00 so real tho!😂❤😊
Winter van life isn’t always fun especially when you’re water tanks turn to ice you have to get the snow off the van it’s freezing cold & the heater decides to die but the snow always looks beautiful 😉
2:18 helmet and blueberries 😂
Whoa, was that an open flame, like, inches away from your fabric window cover? Yikes.
That ag green stuff is $60 for travel packets
Kara and Nate are such a cute couple
Another fake full time vanlifers.
17:32 bro ate raw ramen
don't shave it nate
OM-GOSH YALL WERE IN AMARILLO AND I ACTUALLY WAS BORN THERE!! I’m not currently living there but atleast people know from you guys atleast slightly because when I say I was born in Amarillo Texas they have to look it up 😔
A women that loves her mans stache... Nate you are a lucky man!
OMG THEY CAME TO AMARILLO!! MY HOME
Vegan cheese taste disgusting and most vegan foods are ewww IMO.
WHY DON'T YOU GET A REAL VAN ? THE ONE YOU WERE GIVING AWAY, WORTH 60 GRAND, LOOKED PRETTY DARN NICE.
I think it was clever, Kara…… nice deduction skills.
I love the slow motion “re-play” on Kara’s turn this lever 😂
Having seen your earlier pre-mustache videos, I happen to think you look better without it. I can understand the shock of looking into the mirror after it is gone and thinking "Who the f*** is that?!" But then again, I have had a furry face since I got out of the Air Force in '82. I am not the only one who has been shocked to see my "naked" face. After a mishap with a beard trimmer guard, I had to end up shaving the whole beard and mustache, as I stepped out of the bedroom I ran across one of my step-daughters who literally freaked out and started screaming. (Her mom and I had been married for a little over a year at that point.)
chees is no chees wen ther is no milk in it😁
Kara & Nate are the goats
14:39 lol
"I'm typically like Monica.. when  it comes to living in the van.."  "Who's Monica?"  ..I knew exactly who you were talking about. 😂 lol  ❤🎉  Endless love to yall from IL USA!!!!

When I see a van I always think of Kara and Nate
My dad is a plumber 😊
“I love you so much i’d walk up a hill for you” 🤣😂😭🤣😂😭😂🤣😭😭😂
* getting dressed to ski *  Kara: “I could wear my tie dye hoodie 😊” Nate: “it’s a crop top” 😂😂😂😂
Just a quick question whats exactly in the salad. I watch EamonandBec it looks as though you added something. The colored chunks . Love your videos.  Enjoying all of them
@20:30 kara looks high af 😂😂
I love your guys vibe , your video makes me feel like I’m there with you I’m definitely following

Love you please do more skiing videos ❤❤❤
I live there
Ko
Definitely Kara's idea lol 💡
Hi
This is the standard weather in Scotland
In 🇲🇰 is 54-%
I am subscribe
OMG, you were right down the street from my house and totally could have stayed here.  Also, just in case you didn't already know, you were right next door to the Santa Fe Opera.  There are BEAUTIFUL views from their main parking lot. AND, you were at REI on the wrong day!  LOL.  On Saturdays, March through December, the Santa Fe Artists Market is directly across the street from REI.  My husband and I participate in that.  I'm a potter and he is a painter.  The farmers market happens at the same time right across the tracks too.  You can get fruits and veggies, honey, soap, breakfast and COFFEEEEEEE!
He new outfit you got Kara the brand is vuorl and it is the best band in the world. I am literally wearing a short and short from there right now and I wear it literally every day they’ll clothes are amazing.
Kara is so adorable.
I miss van life 😢😂❤
😂
I always forget that Americans use Fahrenheit so when they said -4 I was like what!? That’s not too bad the I remembered like oh I’m an idiot😂😂😂
When you asked Siri for the weather ours responded 😂
can we talk about her handwriting!?!?
AMEN!!.   LOVE EVERYONE!!.   LOVE GOD!!.   LOVE JESUS!!.   LOVE MARKY!!.           AMEN!!.   LOVE HALEY!!.   AMEN!!.   LOVE EVERYONE!!.   AMEN!!.
Shave it Nate, you look amazing without it lol....sorry Kara
The YouTube rich pretending to be poor. Most people are struggling to pay for food.
You know Kara is the same name as mine mine name is Karalynn
hi
This was one year ago?! I remember watching this and waiting for the next episode. Man time flies.
-you punch my face on pourpose...   😄😄
Bruh it is -52 right now in Canada do not complain
Are you guys vegetarian or vegan? Love your vids
I love  you guys you both Start my morning
I’m watching this year after it was posted and I love the snow I am really inspired by your guises lifestyle I really don’t think I’d be able to do it I’m only 10 but I have a Lotta stuff and I just like take for granted everything I have and I watch your guys Videos and I have seen friend you’re my best friend love it .
Yalls can looks like my nana's house.  Hoard city. Nate you don't look like a teeny bopper anymore!  You look so grown up with that mustache!
Don't scrape the ice off the inside of the windshield, put the defrost on high, and be sure to crack the windows to let the water vapour out. Also don't wipe the condensation off, it leaves a mess on your windshield. A message from the great white north, we know a couple things about the cold.
hey man -7 to me is hot bc I'm a Canadian
plz shave the thing we like old nate #oldnate
Oh my Gosh!! I live in Amarillo!!!!
Can y’all make another stop/meet and greet in Amarillo again? Huge fan!👍🏼🙏🏼
guys a few days after you going to the snow you feel sick like I am
like I wanted to a creative band when I’m older like you guys, but I have to pay for everything the water and the heater
lol -4 isn't Cold to name I live in Minnesota it's - 20 all the time or -10 lol.
I like nates socks
I live in New Mexico!
👨‍👩‍👧❤🎉🎉
They are old They need kids.
They need kid
I love that you both call a water hose a hose pipe! I’m from Mississippi and I live in Alabama. My mom lives in Mississippi and often gets weird looks when she calls it a hose pipe. If you also called underwear “step-ins” like my grandmother did, I’d be convinced we’re related. 😂
I’m also a fan of writing things I’ve already done on my to do list just so I can cross them off. 😂 I need credit for what I’ve done, and the satisfaction of crossing it off is 👌🏼.
The porn stache doesn’t look good on Nate. Lol😂
22:30 😂😂 i love you Kara ❤
What was your Georgia video? The state
I just can't take Nate seriously with his moustache.HaHa
I`m sooooo jealous right now, I won't be able to ski this year since I have to study for my finals in the only free time I have which is the skiing season.
I snowboard and you guys look like your doing good for skiing but I don’t know what good is for skiing!
I live in Alberta Canada and it’s like -20 To -30 every day in winter
It is your name in the whole coffee thing. If I had had someone speaking to me that's a sweet way and being so supportive everything you said to me and telling me how great it was all the time I've heard would still be married instead I got some thing. Very different from that. I need to keep it up you are an amazing example of what a man to be each of his way his wife 😅😅
Just so you know depends on the cheese you bought but normal cheese is not vegan. A vegan diet excludes any meat and animal products
By by flavor saver
You poor vegans y do you do that to your self I don't need to kill somting every time I eat  put I do need food that sticks to my ribs .
Nate....mustache 😂 come on man......
19:10 minutes in. Did Nate say shit? 😂
How do they take a shower? I’m confused 😂
You need my dad with the plumbing my dad is a Plummer
panino is one sandwich, panini is plural
Amarillo my town
Hi!
You need to get a real knife.  10x over worth the price and you're going to cut a finger off with that steak knife.
Nate looks hot with facial hair he should grow it out
Is anyone else wondering why he didn't just mix some antifreeze in the gray water container under the van?
Kara  You are  A flake.
I'm so glad Nate is gonna shave his mustache. Can't get used to it.
nat: this is home for the night  kara: WE'RE GOING GAMBLING!  I DIED LAUGHING Man it was so funny 🤣🤣😂
22:02 you guys should invest in some rain-x anti fog stuff ...you buff it into the window it stops it from fogging up then the fog can't freeze.... Using bar of like Dove soap is the cheap man's way you just rub it all in the window then buff it ...works on mirror in bathrooms to
5:30 that's perfect...it's temp easy to switch from summer or winter or easy to dump if you just keep that one
as somebody who lives in sweden and seeing you guys freak out for a couple of days with -10 to -20 celsius makes me laugh a little. we are all from different places and used to different tempratures but here in sweden on winter days that can last weeks it usually gets down to -20 celsius even in the day but we carry on with ours days normally haha
THIS LOOKED SO FUN!!!
Haha I can’t stop laughing at Kara “oooh I can wear my tie dye hoodie” Nate “ItS A CrOp ToP”
it feels weird seeing nate having a mustache. i've only watched their vids made in 2021. and i started watching them a couple days ago..
Love how that mustasch goes all around your head Nate
Go to vail
I can do a black diamond and I am ten
when I watch you guys I feel like I am there, like I am talking to you guys. And I love every second of it, I never taught I would say this but your channel brings me joy and you guys are the only ones. I appreciate your videos and please never stop filming
YES!!! You guys definitely need to do a 24 hour video at Jungle Jims! My fiancé and I & kiddos live an hour from there and visit on a monthly basis! You guys are our favorite channel and hang on each and every video! You guys are the best!
I have a question ..lol how do you shower now? Your life is my husbands dream, maybe one day.
Nate, there's a caterpillar growing on your nose. Set it free.
The fact that Nate knows what a crop top is. hahaha
Great video - as usual. I know I'm like 8 months late to this but I'm working through your videos. One request for any future videos is to mute Hey Siri. My HomePod/iPhone/Apple Watch all respond. It's super annoying!!
Idk why but this video makes me so happy ☺️
@nate… in this video at approximately 23:13 you hit the slopes … you are wearing an orange. Ish hoodie / base layer… what brand is it? You know where you got it?
I’ve been going to Taos since I was born!! Love y’all’s vids!!
I live in that neighborhood
I am literally having some good vibes rn😂😂😂😂Ah!(ﾟρﾟ;
Hello you all
I actually enjoyed watching you both it calmed my nerves.
i always think kara reminds me of someone and i couldn’t figure out who but now i’ve cracked it. the woman from bee movie. sorry for saying you remind me of vanessa bloome from bee movie kara but i think it’s just the voice …. of course not related to falling in love with a bee
John 14:6 .Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.
When skiing is what you do a lot of it is so fun to just point your skis straight down hill on blue
How do u wash your clothes
turning was completely your idea kara.l nate was lost and confused,
If You Eat Healthy,you don,t need a 103 dollar sjit scoop off water shit 🙋greetz from Dallas hospital dietary 🏅🙋
The first (only) time I went skiing it was.the funeist thing I'm so jealous 😗✌✨❄
The way that they talk to each other with such encouraging words is heart warming
:o MUSTACHIO

What’s your guises job
What’s your guises jobs

How can I find the Salida camping location?  If it is a secret I will trade you for our fav camping spot in Buena Vista with views of the colligate peaks.
I made a new year’s resolution to learn to ride my bike this year
What was the app you used to find the casino?
Bro that mustache has been throwing me off
I don't know how ski on a mountain
i love your videos
That mustache tho. Lol 😂 love it, so retro!
wait you guys so that cadalac its like the presdents car
"Let's write it on the list and mark it off."  Yes!  It still counts.  I think Nate is a lot handier than he thinks.
25:12 now i want a sandwich...
nate wuy do you have a mustash
,,Van life is weird,, -Nate, 2022
When nate was squished when doing the blue bucket water thing my claustrophobia acted up instead of him... Oh lord the struggle it whould take to get me to live in a van 😂
“I HAVE NEVER LOVED YOU MORE!” 😂
I love how Nate said “I’m so proud of you” and Kara put her hands up all happy 😂😂
Hello
That mustache is great😩
i live in amarillo
at 22:22 Nate looks like a basic white girl in leggings and a hoodie😂
Nate make Kara ag1 for coffee!!!
Welcome to New Mexico!
i saw cara boobos
27 degrees is like are summer in england
Kara's idea for sink Nate
Might be better to hang your gloves upside down, then again good snow gloves won't be wet inside.  Sounds like that was ice on the hlll.  Well done ya all! Love the mustache.  You look like a grown-up man.  Very handsome.
How y’all take shower tho? Don’t tell me y’all don’t take shower for days, if that the case, Y’all must stank so bad….🤣😂🤣😂
WE GET TO GO TO DURANGO SOON!!!!!
Kara is for sure always the sexy one but Nate I feel you comin in Hott with that stache too!! 😂 you guys are awesome let me just say. ❤️
the british when they say 27deggrees thats bioling
They gonna visit every country state next
The only good vegan cheese is tofuti. All their fake dairy is good, they make cream cheese, ricotta, cheddar single, and icecream sandwiches. I'm a dyed in the wool real dairy lover and they're good.
Not sure if you read comments from old videos but why didn’t you run antifreeze through your drain and grey water tank?
It’s unattractive when’s girls act dumb
Nate looks like Mario 😟
Hey Kara and Nate can you tell me what kind of pipe that is for building a new gray water tank plz
You are eating raw ramen ? LOL Vegan is
I just wanted to say that at the beginning, Kara said she's like Monice, and at minute 5 of the video, she said- "I KNOW" exactly like Monica 😂
i wanna know the internet bill cost
OK 27 degrees in the morning is great here
Does Kara actually do anything? Nate seems to do all the hard work :S
Taught myself how to downhill ski but been years since last skiing. With it even only 20min away a Hill..!!!
I have been in -30 and ur freezing at -4
Nate i never saw u whit a Moustache
Kara French Fried when she should have pizza'd.  You French Fry when you pizza, you're gonna have a bad time.
Oh yeah!  @27:40 rockin' that classic Casio F-91W!  Hells yeah! Still have every single one of my classic Casios.
please take me on one of your trips with you
just downloaded fare drop, you two are living a dream, I wish I could take a year off to van life it up, stay safe out there, looking forward to future vids!
I'm sorry but were is your fridge 😕
So you slept in a casino parking lot but then wake up and go shopping at REI......................  That's like sleeping on the metro in Paris and having breakfast @ Guy Savoy!!!!!!!!!!!
She trying to be healthy but look like she 50… just being honest
what mileage do you guys get?
My favorite thing about traveling in an RV is the ability to pull over and take a nap, go to the bathroom or make some food.
omg I know where that apartment is in dallas lol
Nate - time for an Apple Watch!
My dad's gaz cap string broke too and he hasn't lost it yet so I believe in you both
Love the videos but where do you shower then?
The montage of him explaining what’s wrong with the sink 🤣🤣 that’s what my mind does when guys try to explain mechanical stuff loll
That moustace and hair has got to come back!
Ag1 taste nasty though
Make sure you guys are eating enough food in terms of calories
If yall have a kid can it be me
No offense but im 11 and I think I may know a bit more about pluming then Nate
If I could share what I want too
I love you regardless ❤️
Hi, Keep the van clean or you'll have some uninvited guests (rats). They are hard to get rid of. Good videos.
They are such a lovely couple❤
Funny indeed
I’m sorry Kara, but I hope to speak for all Italians, I wouldn’t call plant based cheese real cheese, much less call it “un panino con tre formaggi”
Can you guys buy a bus so it can be big
He should go back TEs I think the bronze sits better for sure
Whats the app you used to find places to sleep at?
Finally, Some one who dont DEEP CLEAN the van before a Video, There showing us the truth to Van Life
What does the athletic greens taste like?
God bless you again for defending our country on our own land
You guys are fun
What??!  I just saw a video from TN about changing gray tanks..which didn’t happen.. now you’re in Amarillo….And there was no moustache.   Is there a way to number or date your vids so I’m not so confused? Please?!  Maddie T. numbers hers, so I can watch them in order. It’s so helpful!
Kara “I could wear my tie dye hoodie,” Nate “It’s a crop top.” LAUGHED SO HARD❤️❤️
Well well well, I got the Buck List for myself over the Christmas holidays...and I was reading through it and saw someone very familiar in a featured photo in Iceland I think?
Huh I also made a new floor. The list seems a bit light. Let’s right that and cut it off
Nice video edition
I live in -50 in canada

$500 a night?! kookoo!....glad your in your van
where do you take showers if you have skis in there?
Maybe next time y’all visit Amarillo the newest Buc-ee’s will be built! The project should be complete within the next two years!
do any of these places give you a hard time about parking/sleeping in their parking lots?
Taos is absolutely gorgeous! had the opportunity to RV through NM and Texas and I want to go back so bad!
It's videos like these that make me want to throw all my eggs in one basket and buy a van. So many options and configurations. If I end up getting one it has to be perfect...or as close as I can get to it on a budget lol.
Belly piercing and a mustache. Love you wild ones
You should go to snowshoe West Virginia it’s my favorite place on earth no other place I would rather be then there!!
Nice stash Nate! 👍
Great video! Curious - how many miles per year do you drive? and how much does it cost to maintain the vehicles mechanics (engine, drivetrain, etc.  - not the camper mods; just to keep the van running)?
OMG!  I wish I had constant footage of, ‘what was said’ to replay!!!!
https://youtu.be/FTooUx-963U
What is the name of that book that Nate has mentioned several times about travel and getting out of your comfort zone.  and Kara read it later and they started traveling?
Your only fooling yourself. Plant base cheese is revolting. Same with plant base protein (veggie meat). 🤮  Good video though.
That casino is 35 mins away from me and it is the weirdest feeling because no youtubers usually are near were I live
To think that all that is happening inside a van in a parking lot at Lowes...
The slow mo Kara was right recap has me dying 🤣🤣🤣
That is so badass..and I don’t even ski! But I’ve live in snow and what TN calls snow and this is just awesome.
My off brand fluf crocs are from amazon and i love them
Why u dont install diesel heater in your van
If I don’t marry a Nate I’m not gonna marry anyone.
I've been really enjoying your winter adventures!! I just moved to Montana so I think I should probably learn to ski! I'm also FREEZING so I would love to know the brand of Kara's cute coat! :) THANK YOU!!
Dude watching this video gave me soo much joy and your guys persona is so addicting ! you two seem like lovely people and i really enjoy your guys vlogs <33
In Maine, about 2 weeks ago in my birthday, first day there it was -17 Fahrenheit and it was coldddd we went skiing in it to
I would absolutely love to live in a van and go traveling but my motion sickness could never lol.
I'm sorry but I have to tell you that that's not cold where I live -30 degrees is a normal
Get a gas cap with a key
Lol it’s been -40 here for like 2 weeks
You guys are the freakin BEST!!!!!! Best couple best YouTubers best everythiiiing
TIP> FOR KARA AND NATE< USE SHAVING CREAM ON INSIDE OF WINDOWS TO ELIMINATE MOISTURE... USE WATEROPROOFING SILICONE INSIDE DOORS ON SEALS ONCE A YEASR SHOULD BE GOOD TO ELIMINATE MOISTURE COMING IN- from a wee Canadian Canuck
👍
Hi guys, love the video. Love the way you two learnt to ski. I used to compete in skiing and it is allways lovely to see someone get into it. Just a quick tip I guess you can call it that. When you are about to do your last run of the day, don´t say it is the last run, because pro ski people believe it brings bad luck. Just say "we will go one more time." Anyway great video. Love you bye! <3
Hey yall, so next time theres ice on your window fill a plastic bag with hot water and run it over the ice and it will melt away in seconds, a real life saver. I love your content btw keep it up!!
i live in Santa Fe and totally missed you! the one week where i leave town 😝if you're ever back this way do a meet up?
17:23 was I the only one that heard that-
We get -25 here
SWEET MUSTEGEGE NATE
Really need to get organised you used to be so good now??? UK
Wait... yall have a house?
18:03
Aww! Nate looks so much like his grandpa.
Ok I have to say it..   Nate's moustache looks so good .. ugh
Nate you need to shave
-2 digress isn’t that cold really
Hi I love your vids
Both of you are really cute.
https://youtu.be/-WvV9w0aRuw
Am i alone with this feeling? I find it really uncomfortable watching ultra-enthisiastic hyper happy people. It's obviously a me problem but just wondering if I'm alone?
Kara and Nate, I just love coming along on your adventures. I live in Colorado and you took me places I haven't been to or fully experienced. You have such a good energy. We haven't skied for two years either, but I'm hoping to get out again. You two remind me of how good it feels to be out on adventures. I'm 64 and my husband is 71, but we still plan on getting out skiing, bicycling and traveling You both  inspire me to get back outside.
idk why but i get so much joy from watching youse
I now remember going there but went tubing.
I use that same foam stuff in my basement around my washer, dryer, water heater, and furnace. It makes a softer surface when we're standing there doing laundry, and my furnace technician says he really appreciates having it to kneel on when he comes to service the furnace!
always love your adventures guys
We will miss you deeply Nate’s mustache. Gone. Not forgotten.
Are you going through cuba mexico?
Stomp it tutorials is incredibly helpful!
It is my husband and I’s dream to go traveling one day in our own van- we are starting to save money right now to hopefully be able to do this in a few years and experience so many places we never could otherwise. Could you guys give us any idea how much money we should expect to spend on a livable van? I’m only 21 and I don’t really have a good idea of how much to make a goal. I’ve got my little envelope ready and decorated but we’re still just kids and trying to figure things out lol.
*4 years later* okay so today were gonna fix our jet and fly to the Bahamas
29:29 - yes - pls shave off that smudge of hair in bw ur nose and upper lip.. lol haha
23:20 - i thought the point of clearing the shower was for the ski equipment BUT u ended up renting it at the resort??
22:28 - nice find... free parking is always good
21:30 - u guys are paying to park there???... ok
1:19 why is there a patch on nates head?
Super glade you said something about that app that’s gonna be really useful for me when I do my road trip down south in my truck.
Not to be rude but you should go to the rocket mountains next
Panini is actually plural and a derivative of "pane" or bread. To say "I am making a sandwich" you would say, "Sto cucinando un panino". Love your vids and I hope you guys have safe travels. Buona fortuna!!!
I used to ski in CO all the time. Those greens actually look pretty intense for a green. Nice work 🤙
I love how Nate always makes Kara coffee.  Those little things mean so much.
Just curious which apps you guys use to find places to park overnight?
Nate the mustache looks great! Loved this video guys!
"who's monica" hahah same Nate, same.
I am drinking strawberry lemonade natural flavor but not in the can in a spray bottle Yep in a spray bottle that you usually put on cleaning supplies and I’m drinking lemonade in it and I got done with Pepsi Pepsi Dr Pepper yummy you guys should try it someday Walmart🍋🍓
How do you guys shower
REI you can return your stuff the next  yr. when you're ready for new, (no matter how ratty your stuff ends up being) and get a full refund. So it's like one investment, and you can always update
Look at Nate harnessing your inner Riley (Sailing La Vagabond) with that stache!  🤪
Same watch as me 😂
Idk why but I was happy when they showed the temperature in degrees celsius
Y’all need a new van
have you guys tried snowboarding before?
You should visit bakuriani in georgia there are very  good place to ski like didveli
Hehe. Awe so cute ! y’all are talkin about the “winter” temp being -3 u say? Well I’m over in Toronto and it’s -15 ish with the windchill making it feel like -30. Lol!
Put the gas cap on the fuel tank door when you open it. That's what gas attendant's do in NJ
They remind me of GABI peteto and the bald guy.
I have not watched These guys a month and then all of a sudden Nate has a mustache
i love your mustache
Don’t think that moustache looks good on Nate at all.
i feel like kara would go crazy living in saskatchewan because it is -40°C up here
The mustache is brutal…
You need a roof rack bad.
I’m very sorry about your loss it most be super sad
You guys are awesome, your chemistry reminds me a lot of my wife and I. It would be great if one day we were able to travel like you guys do. Thanks for the great videos!
Them say -20C us in Edmonton with -40c -30c
I ordered the greens but want to ask how hard is it to stop the subscription. I couldn't find that part.
Sir that’s better than our weather we get down to -35 dont underestimate New York
To bad you didn’t get to Amarillo by morning!😂
But does AG1 have a good taste? Usually “green” juice is nasty
Nate why the mishmash
Okay hold up, wait a minute... WHO TF EATS RAMEN NOT COOKED??!! HUH
have you ever been to colorado they have so much good skiing
Love you guys! Epic video as always!
Earlier this week it was 0 degrees outside
Anyone else skiped the ice scraping part 🥶🥶
noo the mustache makes you look 80
Nate channeling Matthew McConaughey...
Have you guys ever had a knock on your window while sleeping? And if it has happened what did you do? I would be totally freaked out.
Where r they gonna use the toilet
How will they shower
so... idea... nate should grow out his hair.... just saying
......but I LIIIIIKE Nates mustache :-/
This is so aesthetic and I love ur videos it’s sooooooooo COOl 🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🤩🤩🤩😃🤩😃🤩🤩🤩😃❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
Did I just trip out watching this yes yes I did
Not me cringing when Nate called last run 😬 I'm from Massachusetts and we're superstitious but I've also been skiing for over two decades, don't call last run! That's when bad things happen!
Make some real food next time
Welcome to beautiful Northern New Mexico! I literally recognized every location that you visited in Santa Fe by the background shots alone. After following you around the world to places I’ve never been, it was so strange to see you in my own familiar backyard.
I thought you were gonna shave that stash off!!!!  Lol
at 13:09 the intrusive thoughts hit lol
I love seeing your adventures! you two are so well suited for each other, and seem like lovely people. All the best!
Try the wether in my Buffalo on Ellicott Field because it was 1° all the time and I live here so I should know
That dance from Kara at 25:57 is straight out of wii sports
So when and where do y’all shower??
Not feeling the mustash
Panino is the singular of panini, no s needed.
Wow, I don’t know why I haven’t been watching you.  I am subscribed but you don’t come up in my feed!  That’s very suspicious to me.  Oh well, I will search you if I need to watch your videos.  You guys are adorable, I love it.  I’ve been living vanlife for 19 months now and started planning by watch Eamon and Beck, Trent and Allie, the Nomadic Movement, 40 Hours of Freedom, and Kombi Life.  You are in great company! 🙋‍♀️ Question?  Where did you buy the rubbery flooring?  What’s it called?  I would like to put it in my van.  My feet get frozen too.  😎🚐🥾
Ok this might be one of my fav videos from y’all EVER
Like that 70's porn mustache!
My old jeep has a broken window.
"and now we're going gamblinnnngg" 🤣 I laughed way to hard lol
I love you guys in so many ways. I wish I could explain, but not in a comment. I hope one day we cross paths, but for now I will try my best to send you guys our love through views and sharing your videos to friends and family. Im curious about the green juice you guys talked about,  I don’t usually buy things from “sponsors” but if it helps you guys financially, I’ll do it! Plus it’s beneficial for us too, can always use more vitamins 🙂 anyway you two are incredible, good luck on your trip to Mexico, we’re locals here in San Diego and travel there often, I highly recommend soaking in a little bit of San Diego’s energy before you head south, maybe then we can cross paths. ☺️  Regardless thank you for always applying positive vibrations. Rooting for you two always. Good luck ✌️
I live in alberta Canada and it gets down to -45 degrees celcius here... so -20 aint bad lol.
Come to Oregon!!
Eamon & Bec 😔
Browsing your video is like reading a good book! I have benefited a lot! Thank you for your hard work!🥰 Your channel is great. I'll never get used to saying it is worthy of a million likes! Fully watched! 💯🥰💝.
How many miles are on that van
kara you look so pretty with the nose ring
Shower/ski locker/washroom, love it
i am in canda right now and it is -15f
Take the tree or ur face
Just wanted to say that you guys have perfected coexisting with technology without letting it takeover your lives. It’s really refreshing to watch and I think it’s what technology should be here for. Also, glad you guys are enjoying Veganuary! Appreciate you both trying 😁
The inside of their van looks like a New York City apartment, nice and small…. Except an NYC apartment costs about a million more. So I’d say, though it’s a lot of work, it’s a win 😂😂
I've been watching you guys for a while and let me tell you, today this video just made me smile so many times without even trying, thankyousomuch for being so influential and contagious when it comes to your guy's attitude, outlook, and overall 'take' on life. Ya'll are awesome!
Good for you guys for celebrating veganuary!!! 🙌 looked great!!!
The tash is a no no, nay nay, nian nian, nO nO, non non, ei ei ':(
BALD SPOT
im sorry but i had to laugh when i saw yall ski because you look like the children in switzerland that are pretty new but already this good. but your american so its diffrent because we can go skiing way easier i think and its part of our culture :D
-10? -4? for a van yes that is cold but for me who lives in a small house in Minnesota we are experiencing -25F or below!
How do you shower
Hey I have a question if you don’t mind then how do you make money
22:40 "who dis" IM DONE🤣
Omg Kara I just noticed your nose ring. I have one on the same side and it's a diamond as well. Most ppl don't notice it to be honest. I really wanna see Nate w a Goatee. I think he'd look great. Hopefully you guys stay warm! I'm in the house and complain lol
really enjoy these kinds of videos, gets me inspired to go on a epic road trip like you two. On a side note though, I love to see people cooking for themselves and one another, but it pains me to see people struggle to put together meals using tiny dull knives. if you can buy a decent chef knife, it doesn't have to be a fancy Japanese one. Just get a 6"-10" inch one, Mercer or Dexter brands are food industry standard, and are no more than $40 and will last a lifetime with a little bit  of care. Get one and watch you make that tortilla soup recipe done at the speed of light.
You guys are bad actors you're so fake
It looks cozy. I want one to go places. They make it look fun even tho sometimes it’s not, but still looks like something I wanna do lol
I want a van like this 😩
Hiiiiii
This video was fun to watch! Good job good work 👌👍
Bro you look like Cristiano Ronaldo wtf! Great content btw! :)
slo mo I told you so was epic!
I went to santa fe last spring break and went to that same REI! right as i saw that u guys were there i was like hmm an REI in santa fe and then i saw the outside and i was like… IVE BEEN THERE!
wish you guys came to alabama <3
You look like you need to be in a 240sx drifting with that style :)
The fact that people can hate on such sweet, amazing and genuine people is very disgusting! Kara and Nate if you see this know that you have MANY supporters and those people who hate just don’t have anything else to do ! You guys are awesome and make my day MUCH better when I see y’all videos. Love you guys❤️
Hey, when are you going to update your website with the expense and revenue?
👍
I would like to get some of those flooring pads.  What's the name of them and where did you get them from?
I live in CO
omg i havnt seen ur videos in so long!! ive missed watching u guys<33
Nate looks really cool with the mustache!
"I don't understand how plumbing works" oh jeeze.
I love when you feature Eamon & Bec in your videos!!!
2 questions bro no 1 how you heat your van 🚐 second how your van diesel not freeze 🥶 you use any anti galling
Where were you skiing? What country?
Done
Lol where I live we have been in the negative thirties (Celsius) for about a month. Right now it’s -37 😂
Just found your channel on our journey from Texas to Oregon for the holidays. You guys are a lot of fun. Get the popcorn... Wifey poo and the animals are going to be binging on your channel. Stay safe. Peace
K and N-  -4 is SO COLD Midwesterners- I’ll see your -4 and raise you -30
I, hope you change your Van to 4*4 one, with change. The suspension , Off road tirs,.........etc. So , you can go through Snow weather easally.
why does nate look`s like a guy from france
no more earthroamer.😓
That made my heart happy you've got some strong friends ❤  I can wait to see becc come out of his stronger then before
LOL this is a great video! Quick question - what brand is that hoodie that Nate is wearing in this video? It looks really cozy and warm - I want to buy one :) Thanks in advance!
Nice stash Nate
I’m australia 40 degrees is literally as hot as it will get- it is so, so hot at 40 degrees.
I an so, so excited to see more from y’all and be apart of ur journeys!
If we’re talking about same Walmart you’ll be glad you didn’t stay there in Santa Fe. So many people walking around will knock on your window in middle of night I tried to sleep in that lot once and had my bike on back it didn’t work out ended up moving
Put double sided tape around you windows and then good plastic around them. It will stop that annoying inside ice.
your crazy, I live in Florida and get cold.
Great video!  What you guys using to keep your van toasty?
Do you have a heater (not the heater that comes stock) in the van?
I went skiing like 4weeks ago and I swear I went to the same place
Go to door county Wisconsin
Oh my Nate has a mustache 😅
You guys should buy electric socks. they work like a charm
Ok, you guys are always in good spirits even when the chips are down. But Nate your positivity and happiness in this video is contagious ☺️ have fun guys
I’m curious if the propane will still be vented outside? Wasn’t there a hole drilled through to the bottom of the van where the propane originally was?
awww. I wish I knew you were in Santa Fe. You could have parked in my driveway.
Uhh i still watch this channel even tho im more of a gamer
That mustache.
We Italians don't have cheese sandwiches, but in case we would call them “panini ai tre formaggi"
This was amazing I hope I will once have an adventure like yours
How do Kara and Nate wash their clothes? Am I th only person who wonders that?
Let get you to 3mil
Whenever we stay in our camper I’m the one who tidies everything up lol. And I’m 13
Nate looks like randy orton
Like that u added celsius!! Really nice :)
Everytime I see a picture of Nate with his mustache it throws me for a loop for like 3 seconds while my brain figures out he isn't Dusty! 😂
Looks like Taos is a blast & that you two enjoyed skiing 🎿⛷️🥽 I wasn't aware that #EamonandBec have a vegan cookbook 📖 Thanks to you two, I'm ordering a couple of them! Keep the mustache Nate! It looks great, and I can tell that Kara really likes it 🤫🤭
First 9 min boring 👎👎
That was a great  video you two. It’s good to see you having such a blast. Repairs included 😀
What’s up with the porn stache
Awesome video
At least in the North East, this has genuinely been one of the coldest winters in years. I wish you both luck!
Just found you. You guys are great. Only thing I don't like is the porn star moustache...but thats a personal preference. Thank goodness eveyone voted it off.
It's my second year watching your videos. Hoping for more happy trips for both of you! Sending love from the Philippines.😍
Come to Savannah! I'll show you around
You guys are epic! Love all your videos and the energy you bring to each situation you are faced with :)
I love you guys. You bring such joy with your interactions and encouragements of each other. Thank you for sharing your lives.
if you believe they really live in a van i have a bridge to sell u
I aspire my relationship to be even half of what you beautiful couple have 💗 Love you guys!
kara and nate regular content  ok kara and nate vinter content   unbeateble
Nate’s mustache is genuinely repugnant.
4:53 I did not know GlaDoS could say Lowes... I call the Female Self Checkout voice Either Cortona or GlaDos based on the 2 tones my Self Checkouts had at one of my old jobs.
Lowe’s Hates Autism No Joke
Pubity stach
i bet this is a dumb question but how do they get money for gas and food
Im really happy that you have been in New Mexico
I just watched the video where you went skiing in the mall in Dubai (I started from the beginning because I'm new here)...and Nate was like "Does that mean maybe one day you'll go real skiing with me?" And Kara was like "maybeee." And I had just watched this video last night! And now look at what y'all are up to! 😁🥰
Nates love for the floor and brags on your skiing were so pure, so proud of himself and you lol!! The travel vlogs with Charlie were no doubt some of my favorites you guys are hilarious together, look forward to a possibility of more in the future?!
11:27 kara is such a vibeee
next time put antifreeze in the gray water tank. it wont freeze if it is about 1/2 gallon of antifreeze.  just remember you can no longer use that water.  A bonus fact is you can find antifreeze that is animal safe if you do hit something that breaks the tank and leaks.
I love skiing its the best thing to do
I love this video! Please post more of your skiing in the future videos!
They make a real pair of insulated crocs if interested
This video is fantastic. You two seem so happy - glad to see you enjoying your time together on the slopes!
Nate my man grow beard or shave the mustache
🍉🍯✨🍭
love the pedo stash 👌🏼
Great video! One of your best in a long time ❤️❤️❤️
No washing😫
Hey y’all!! Not sure if someone else has said this since there’s 2k comments I can’t even check. But!!! It’s important!!! In ski/board culture, make sure to never say “last run of the day” , it’s bad luck!! Always say 2nd to last run of the day even when it’s your last :) that way you won’t fall hehe :) glad to see ya back on the slopes!
You Guys, Charlie!!!!!!!!!
Shave muststash
So excited for this season! Love K and N!
Ohhh please, those bloody overpriced AG again! Thanks but not worth it
Seeing the Tesuque Casino in one of your videos is so random and cool!! I'm from northern NM and have driven by this probably hundreds of times! Y'all are the best!!
Been watching you guys since norway, and i’m still obsessed!🎉🎉
I Love IOverlander! Even in my little corner of the world, I've managed to find obscure places to empty my tanks and get water - all for free!! I am definitely heading to Walmart for ugly fur lined crocks 😂.
I’m sorry sir WHY DO U HAVE A MUSTASHGGGDGEDHEHGDSHGDSYGGDHWEBDYWE I mean you look great with it but…you look..different
i love how i immediately knew which Monica she was talking about
That burner is way too close to that curtain guys - watch out.
Nate asking Siri about the weather ended up asking my Siri about the weather too 😂
Haha you think -4 is cold we have temperature that goes-40
I was there last summer. LOL! I love Taos, can't ski though and it would be too dangerous to start. Albuquerque has had like a half inch of snow this year. Looks great though.
When Kara say "I KNOWWWW" Kara definitely #monicafriends
where I live in winter the coldest it can get is -8 degrees
LPG does go stale. I was informed, by a large producer, that it has a shelf life of 6 months. I couldn't  boil pasta water. At all. And I wasn't at 4,000 metres altitude either. Same applies to petrol left in outboard motors and chainsaws. They won't start. Good luck. PS, I watched a load of epps, very confusing. Then I discovered I was watching yours with Eamon & Bec epps mixed in. Bloody youtube.
You look like Luigi from mario bros 🤣🤣🤣👍🤟
Vanlife only works when you can live with simplicity, and without all the luxury of a house. These people got carried away.. Way too much unnecessary stuff.
Why not just insulate the tanks? Love the vids !!
I just love y'all
Dont. Block the shower.....that salt life is not it... 😀Rest is cool
Keep the mustache Nate!
Most plant based vegan food is all synthetic and processed. It is sooooooo bad for you! Soy bean them self was created in a lab! If you are going to eat vegan you should grow your own clean food! This is why most vegans are dying early.
Iam interested in what is nate doing for work?
hi mate, i really found your channel because of the mustache, is cool. For long time i want a clean shave with mustache and that short one seems very nice. how long is your mustache? how do you trim it
If you guys Mexican Mexican Car INS. Stop by at Baja mex for the drive-thru money exchange AND car insurance. Good luck in Mexico!
Just saw Bec's announcement before I watched this video.  Prayers for them.
You truly went back to your Van ;-) Nice Winter Van Video.  We love driving our Sprinter through spain
Love the vid
Please don’t scrape your window on camera again…my poor teeth! 😂
I love y'all omg 💕
NATTTEE!!! You made my house crazy and every Siri device told me the weather 👀
Got hooked during CoVID lockdown. Love the show but lose the pimp stache Nate. You look like a friendly human trafficker.
Your living my dream just apart from the unclean van that would drive me nuts 😂❤️
Any chance you will be visiting Trent, Allie, Leo, Frank, and Lika (YouTubers Trent & Allie) near Salt Lake? 👍
Do you not have a frig anymore?
Whats the name on that yellow hoddy you have on Nate ?
There is a small YouTube channel called Landingdos. Living in Lapland, Finland. With very low temperatures in a van. You can see their videos that are spectacular. You will also see what it is like to live at -30° in a van. The "only problem" may be that Americans don't speak other languages ​​and won't understand much.
You are a vegan
You are a vegan
So please be careful
Because here disturbing people to say something .
So be careful police all criminal is out from jail
I said that bijay dube is catching his mother by police
I said bijay dube boys shanshank dube
Behind every great man is an even greater woman 😌
Thank you for also displaying Celsius when you talk about the weather because Fahrenheit super confuses me!
Ive been watching you guys for about 3 years and how have I never noticed that you have a nose piercing 😂
You guys should try astrophotography.
How amazing would it be with Kara &  Nate do a colla with Trent & Allie!? 😱
Grow a beard to that mustache :)
Tag Dag..!😹
Kara where did you get theat bracelet? id love to get my GF one she'd love it.
Quite impressive that you didn’t get cold in the night! Did you run the heater all night?
ok
Mark you pipe /valve with an arrow to the shower and write shower cut off. You should see if you have rhe same for the sink. Label it!!!
love your vids keep up the work
I HATE THEM BOTH IM WAITING TO MAKE MY MOVE
Cool
Bruh you think it’s cold it’s -40 in Canada overnight
Should've explored more of New Mexico, culturally, cuisine, etc.
Taos is kinda a hard mountain
Ever thought of a roof rack instead of putting stuff in the bathroom, Also putting a propane tank inside is dangerous, one leak and spark and your dead  that’s why they are outside and vent to the outside.
I live in Amarillo, TX and that’s the Lowe’s where I shop all the time. I’m a Kara & Nate Superfan. I’ve followed y’all from almost the very beginning. I look forward to this new van journey. Be safe!
The window cover sooo close to the fire on the stove was streesssinggg me out
He did a lot....girl you had one job. Make sure things are neat and put up.
Lol hey I've spent sun up to sun down at lowes .... oh wait I work at a Lowes
😄❤️
Nate sorry but I don't like the mustache
I used your video as inspiration for my video ^-^ https://youtu.be/UFdm4NutfMA
Great to see you guys back on the road again!
vegan cheese ewwwwwww
Yes no more mustache!!
You need a sombrero with that mustache essay.
I haven't skied in over 20 years. You guys made me want to give it another try. I live too far away from the slopes to do it regularly so maybe when I retire. Have fun!
I love to just watching yall video well painting
How do you do with the time change
LOL Cracked me up with "That's the most powerful hose I have ever used" As your covered in water with water everywhere... Ahahahaha, Keep up the great content, Love your videos!
-6 yeah... Come to Norway and feel -30
Get water boiling in your kettle before adding it to your pot. It will cut down on your cook time!
I’m a little concerned about the ‘cloth’(?) insulated hanging behind the propane stove. 😬
As a Canadian I appreciate you converting Fahrenheit to Celsius more than you know 🤣🙏
Thanks for doing AND mentioning Veganuary. Hope more people feel inspired to try it.♥️
Sounds epic.
You guys should get a little Air Fryer for the van. Honestly, buying an air fryer changed my life. The BEST grilled cheese sandwiches ever are the ones I make in it!!
It got to -15° in New York
I am always so happy when i watch your video's. I'm always home since i got disabled almost 8 years ago. I always wanted to go travel, long trips to the U.S, Austalia, Afrika and of course visit everything in Europe. I always thought that I would have time later in life, when i could efford to not go to work for 3-6 months without getting paid. But i never got there... But i am thankfull for your videos, now i get to see how the world looks like, i haven't missed one video in all these years. So guys, THANK YOU, you change my world, thank you for taking me with you all the time. You guys do a great job!! ❤
I was waiting for the comment about what the last video had on the poll if he should shave or not....sorry Kara but I gave the video a like 😂
How can I order AG1 from Serbia?
I started preparing for winter 2 months ago LOL
Why does beautiful Nate have a mustaches???
Pov you live in Canada and it is -30 degrés half of the time
Awesome videos sorry I’m soo late
I thought Nate snowboarded??
Mustache game strong
Good try on the salad still looked awesome😊
Why don't you sleep in truckstops. I do it all the time when I am traveling and have never had an issue. PLUS if you have a points card and fuel at most of them you can usually take a shower for free. They have food, coffee anything you need.
Meh. -20c isnt bad
You were in Santa Fe!!!! My home town!! Wish I could of met you amazing people!!! 💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
Nate it’s not cheap, it’s call spending wisely 🤣🤣🤣 I learn that after having 3 girls
🤣🤣 that’s the only way to shop when I buy someone something I buy myself something 👍🏾👍🏾
I live in Amarillo
What an awesome video from van packing, improvements, finding a place to sleep and skiing. Wow!  Have to say Nate, although the moustache does look amazing, it does make you look older. Not in a bad way! 😊
You both are adorable!
NO WAY YOU WERE IN AMARILLO
I really want to get into van life - but my job... I love my job... I can get a new job and be 100% remote as an IT person... but I love working for Goodwill.  :D
“Hose pipe!” Love it, proof of where you hail.
I like these two but it makes me really sad that a child has to explain that people littering their undergarments is like decorating a tree. She is a child and should not have to see undergarments in trees at a ski resort
Always put anti-gel in your diesel in the winter
Guys! You know that ''the last ride of the day'' is the forbidden sentence! 😄
I LOVE CHARLIE FROM AUSTRALIA!
Haha I think be a vegan is not as easy as you think,  but you are in the right way,  enjoy!!
whoa dude, you cant just spring a stach like that on us without warning. children are watching
Spot-on Monica impression at 5:05. Also, that window shade hanging THAT CLOSE to the open flame of the stove made me really nervous.
Her eyebrows are missing
I hope they flip the van
Thank you for shaving! Sorry, but I hate the ‘stache  🤐
Oh my gosh, I’ve been wondering about Charlie!!!!
continue being gross you two
This video just goes to show that personality, desire & love triumphs over van skills, in building a large subscriber channel.  Learn as you go, but don’t burn that window covering!  Great video.
I watched again because YouTube said I didnt watch it🤣 so many laughs! Thank you Kara & Nate!!
I BET HAVING FOOTAGE OF WHAT YOU SAID COMES IN HANDY TONS LOL .... imagine them being like I told you I told you lol
Nate with his mustache is just a copy of dusty! They really look alike
I thought you got 50k likes on the video so you would shave the mustache?
I loooove watching you guys, been watching from the beginning and it's amaizing to see you guys grow; however I CAN'T TAKE NATE SERIOUSLY WITH THAT MUSTACHE 🤦‍♀️😂😂😂... stay blessed and keep on living life💪❤
I live in an uninsulated and unheated and unventilated empty van in Colorado... I am not impressed.
Kara, who makes your hoodie at 7:44, please?
Way too long and way too many ads.
Your to-do list videos really inspire us! Thank you for the newfound motivation! 🖤
Nats moustaches
You both have the same vibe with Aemon and Bec. I love you guys! Now, Im a new subscriber! Done!
You guys really need to clean this comment section up or get a moderator who will. *WAY* too many people pushing scams in here, and nothing seems to be getting done about it. *Add their links to the list of banned words. BOOM. Done. Problem solved.* Allowing them to roam around the comments lead to people clicking on their links, which will lead to people get scammed/hacked.  *Do not allow that to happen to your viewers. As a content creator with a large following, you have a responsibility to protect your viewers from these predatory practices.*  Sorry if I come off as brash, but it's sad to see these scams being spammed in every comment thread while seemingly *nothing* is being done to stop them. This should not be a problem. Take care.
Good video
Thanks for the enjoyable video. You guys are amazing!
Nate is correct about vegan cheese. There was only one I would consider a “day one” vegan cheese and it was Chao Cheese by Field Roast
Do you know you guys have fake crocs
Ha ha, Nate!  I can tell you're still a kid at heart from the opening picture.  An adult (me, for instance) would put on a winter coat--maybe even a parka--in weather like that.  You, instead, wear a hoodie, in spite of the fact that Tennessee isn't exactly blessed with real winter weather. May I suggest something that you need to buy for your frosted windows?  Scraping with a plastic blade is worthless and/or time consuming.  Try to find a scraper with a copper strip for the blade.  They work like magic. Being dressed in black, with a mustache, you remind me of Zorro.  : ))
Hate to be mean Nate but you need to shave your  mustache
Van life is tight. Nate like the bucket to collect water for the sink
Nope, can't do that! Maybe skiing is easier than snowboarding, I don't know. I tried snowboarding with my daughter on my 44th birthday. She took me down a blue slope for my first time! 😲 Ski patrol wanted to bring me down the mountain, I fell so much! 😂 Despite the fact that I was an avid water skier when I was young, it took all day to get down that mountain! 🤣 I did make it down on my own and on my own two feet, but, yeah, never again! Took me a year to heal from that, no lie!
looks like an amazing adventure!!!
Mate please shave your mustached since it doesn't look that good on you.i know it's your interest but can you shave it?
Why won’t y’all just get a bus instead of a van .. because yu could have more space while living in a bus .
Please don’t shave!!!!!!!!! The stache gives you sex appeal!!!!!!!!😉
i miss no mustache nate
It's impossible to watch your videos and not be happier at the end. Fantastic video! Have fun!!
Shave that damn mustache
I am looking forward to Nate shaving off his moustache ;-)!
dude looks way better with a mustache
You guys are the best. Stunning footage on the slopes.  Im curious, where do you shower. By my calculations thats a fair amount of days without showering 😜
"And now were going gambling" 🤣 Kara is so funny you two are the cutest. And Kara looks absolutely stunning as well.
Nate your mustache
Lol you guys are to damn cute figuring stuff out. Good job. 👍
Did Anyone notice the veins popping out in Nate’s arm when he was talking and putting in the padding???????
In all seriousness ….I love what you guys do!   Like many, doing this would be a dream for me!!  But…I’m getting a bit old!!  Lol Anyhow….for an episode like this, how many hours of footage did you shoot before editing….or, do you edit as you go along?  Seems like you are always filming!
I love you so much ❤️
With nearly a million viewers ! Why don’t you Just put online any DIY assistance  That you may need ! It’s odds on that there are a lot of people with the easy answer! Ive always found the Aussies & Canucks useful with DIY STUFF 👍 🇬🇧
What’s with Nate’s 70’s porn star mustache??
Love you guys. You went from living out of backpacks to living out of van and buying more crap than you need
Yall need to check out the Liard Hot Springs in BC, Canada :)
Nice video! Just a but, 😉 you are not keeping your promise to us! Most of the votes were to shave the mustache no reaction from you 🤔
Are we rly not gonna talk abt Nate's 🔥 Mostouche
Love this video, you looked like you had so much fun 😃 your curtain behind the gas burner gives me the heebeegeebees! 😮😬is it safe if a draft catches the burner flame? Probably fine just looked so close! Enjoy the skiing and stay warm✨🌠❤️
Nate buddy , please in the name of the wee man shave that off or grow a beard with it you look like a stereo typical 1920's teen who's just gone through puberty!!! Still love you guys !!!
Isn’t it just so cute that Nate makes Kara a drink every morning 🥶🥺🥰
Nate already in his mexican vibe with his moustache!..Looks so cool!
Kara and Nate you have colours of my country
Inspired. By eamon !!!nice
It is so good to see a new video!!!!!!!!!!!! You two are so inspiring, I love your videos!!!!!!!!
I once saw a happy couple going on a tour like this.  Just like Kara and Nate  adorable kids They started out happy and singing so glad to be filled with youth and sense of adventure. In a few days they started arguing. Soon the argument lead to punching and slapping.  The police are called. Tears were shed. Relationship in brink of collapse Conversations became difficult strained Sadly the boyfriend strangled the girlfriend outside the van He left her dead body in the wilderness like an animal And later the boyfriend recalled her murder in his notebook and jumped off a bridge and plummeted to his death Van life lead to murder and destroyed them.  Van life is harsh living  please be careful about misleading people about van life and the incredible hardships Shame on you. These comments was happily sponsored by ag1 and its shaker.  It’s important to keep sponsors and promotions in your videos always. Vejanuary superexcited
Don't cook near the shade again...Please.💗 I was so scared it would catch on fire......Love you guys!,,💖
If no one has mentioned! You need to stop the pump from running when the shower tap is turned on. If the tap gets knocked and the water flow is isolated you will stand a good chance of burning out the pump. And storing skis in the shower there is a good chance it will get knocked.
Guys.... Just buy a better van
Nate is looking HOT.
My grandpa built the Toas ski resort back in the day❤
Glad you guys are back on the road! Wish we were winter sport people. I’m curious, do you guys use a gimbal when you vlog? I️ see no shake, I️ ask lol
I am disappointed in Nate for not knowing who Monica is...  Kara for the win here ! 🥳
Why not put fish tank heater in your water tanks to prevent ice build up  they don't use much electricity and cheap and easy to install.
I’m with Kara. Do not shave the mustache!!!!
Love Watching your Videos!!!!  I am a follower, but sorry that Stash on NATE has to GOOOO!!! lol
not sure how i feel with nates mustache XD
whats the promo for the athletcis greens ?
Nate shave the mustache
Loved this video and all of your fun adventures 💛💛💛
Why isn't the mustache gone yet
If Kara likes your facial hair you should keep it .
you should save up for a earth Romer
I was just in Taos with friends and we went skiing too
I am a little concerned how close your back burner is to the window cover.
thats not nate, thats nate brother tate
...and loving every minute of it. See you guys in the next video!
Will you be skiing at Snowbowl in Flagstaff, AZ? Looks like it is on your route! Safe travels and bye bye mustache!
at 18:35 that truck behind the van looked awesome
Definitely wish these two had their own show! Something about their content is relaxing and calming. A good favourite past time of mine for sure. But did I miss if they were just not going to use the shower at all anymore because of the ski closet? Lmao 🤍 ps, the moustache looks like it’s always been there and he should 100% keep it 😂
So basically Kara has more common sense than Nate (regarding plumbing) ;)
You guys are scared of -4 we’re I live it gets down to -20/-30
Totally waiting for the window curtain to catch fire...
Kara and Nate, I have love everyone single one of your ideas, and I always think “there’s nothing they could do that I would love more than this” and you guys prove me wrong every time.  I came for international travel, and you guys have kept me hooked ever since. But I love skiing Kara and Nate!!
Fills water tank with "NON POTABLE WATER"....
my god your teeth where can i get that from :O
Can we PLEASE get a compilation of Nate running back to get the camera after the van pulling away clips. Love y’all!
I live in New Mexico, and last summer we went up to Taos Ski Valley to hike Wheeler Peak. (New Mexico’s tallest mountain.) You just have to drive down the road a little longer to the Bavarian restaurant and there is a trail that will take you up to the summit.
Felt the pain after leaving REI when I made that same trip this winter to buy snowboarding stuff 😂
Is it me or Nate looks like hitler
After 7 years of living in a house, being the Master Tenant, dealing with the highs and lows of tenants I had a f%*K it moment and decided I needed some me time. I have a small art studio I share and did not feel the need for living in a house with people so I went out and got a 1994 Ford Econoline Club Wagon Van last January and converted it into living quarters. For a year now I've been living in the van in my city and working my job. I'm much happier and my mental stresses or dealing with others has gone. In 10 days it will be my last day of work and 10 days after that I am leaving the state for a 10000 - 14000 mile road trip covering the United States, Canada and into Alaska. I'm excited for this adventure and honestly owe a lot of the jump to Van Lifer Videos like yourselves. Van life is not always pretty but it's become my way of life for the past year and while I cannot stand up in my van, it's cozy and keeps me happy.
Shave
Have you guys ever considered doing the Amazing Race?
This is funny you guys think -4 is normal around here that is nothing it is -21 one day at like 12 pm it is crazy
So how do you all get showers??
Nate with a mustache hits different haha 😂
Too be honest that's the only vegan cheese that tastes ok. Not really like cheese but not gross. My son has a dairy allergy so we've tried a few.
love to see some made in new Zealand things in video's not made in new Zealand
Bro I’m in Texas out by canton ,I’m a plumber so if ya ever need help holler ol son 🤣🤟🏽
No good
Thank you for another enjoyable video.  The family member who put our kitchen floor in did it wrong and most of the tile broke. We did not have the money, but we found the same material you used on our floor and it makes walking through or working in the kitchen much more enjoyable.
Hi I like your videos
Still following you out of all the travelling, vlogging couples as being  the most interesting.
*DO NOT SHAVE*
Nate I know it's cold but please, please please shave the stache! LOL
Looks like y'all are having fun!!!!!
This was wildly motivating!!!!💪
You guys are so fkng cute.....hope Nate shaves that pornstache
A porn-stache?
You guys gotta get used to it it’s -30 here in Canada
When I was a kid we would take the giant r.v. To ski for three days regularly and we all would ski all six of us and my mom and dad would cook hot food for us all day . This makes me remember all the fun we had! Thanks guys
Amazing video
WHY IS NATE GROWING HIS BERD OUT
enjoyed this video so much! the cuts the clips you two :) thanks for taking us along. and this just tells me what the identity of your channel is. not the van not the travels, just the lives of both of you wherever you go.
I love Taos.
What do u guys do for jobs ??
What model Casio watch is that Nate?
Nate not using the Buckee onesie
CharLie!  It's CHARLIE!  haha  I'm laughing out loud already!  OMG - CHARLIE!  CHARLIE!
A ski jacket is called a parka
You guys should come to uk in London
So glad you got to ski Taos!! I absolutely love it there. There's also some hot springs nearby in Santa Fe if you're ever in the area again.
litterally love this video
Actually the stache just isn't you Nate.
Omg I wish I could’ve met y’all! I’m from Amarillo,texas! Well currently in San Diego  California 😂
Thrilled to see y'all back on the road!!!
who the hell is monica :D :D :D
I love your videos, and have followed along since the beginning. You guys have so much fun and live life with kindness and integrity, but....I just cannot overstate how much I Hate the 'stache!! Enjoy Colorado!
Can't you put ski holder on the outside back of the door or on the roof? Just asking.
Best line ever from Kara and Nate   Kara “I could wear my tie dye hoodie”  Nate: “It’s a Crop Top”  Kara “Ok”   I am dying haha 😂
This video was so refreshing!  Felt like old school Kara & Nate vids
I wasn't a fan of the stash the first time... but it grew on me in this video!!
Hey! just a little tip or not so tip I don't know if you did this or not but you should next put go pros on the helmets so we can see what y'all are seeing!
I started to watch uou guys last year you keep up the videos
You guys are THE best. I cannot wait to follow this new adventure!! Leadville video(s) sooooon please!!! <3 <3 <3
keep the stash...rock'n the West Hollywood vibe. 🤠
I wonder if that "I KNOW!" Friends reference at 5'10" was on purpose?
Nate no mustache
I grew up in the Toas area. My grandma lives down there to this day and sells her homemade woodcarvings! I hope you enjoyed your trip. New Mexico is awesome!
i love to skiing i have  been skiing sense i was 2
I think we all can relate to how Nate aspires to be as handy as Eamon when it comes to van builds 😂
This my all time favorite vlog ever
Did you put dry noodles on top of your food?
This going to be such a fun trip to watch. We agree with Nate "you can only like vegan cheese, if you have been vegan for awhile and haven't had real cheese in a long time"🤣.
Hi Kara and Nate!  Not to be rude, but why reroute the grey water and rebuilding it, when you can just put a dash of anti freeze in the original grey water tank to stop it turning in to ice? That's at least what we all do in Norway!  Much less work, same result!   Other than that, i love you guys and i love your videos, and i allways wait unpatiently for your next video!  Love and god luck from Norway! 😊
Nate got a mustache!!!!!
So bizarre that I'm still finding vanlife vloggers I didn't know about before! Thanks for showing the crazy messiness at the beginning of a trip. It felt good knowing that isn't just happening to me!
Kudos to you for preparing vegan meals, and using Eamon and Bec's new cookbook to do it.  No doubt you'll be eating more vegan meals for sure. Yay!
Kara: (after buying clothes at REI)... "That one hurt." That's what happens when you buy designer ski clothes from a ski specialist during the ski season. With Nate's planning skills, I would have thought purchasing ski clothes earlier or online to score a bargain would have been more of Nate's style. That was a great video by the way. I thoroughly enjoyed it.
Guys, i love you  but u need to step out! Go travel again. I know, its hard now but u can do it for sure. I think it will bring great content. Cheers!
Is there video content of Nate where he isn't shouting at us on camera?
Thankyou for the litle -7 degreesC  because i haf now clue what 19 degrees in freedom units means....
REI clothes last forever! It's ok.
shave the beard
Nate's moustache suggests he can do magic tricks now
Nate, when you opened up the well pipe I was saying to my wife, "I bet he doesn't know that pressure is much higher than regular. It's gonna fill up FAST." I hope your van doesn't freeze while flooded. Good luck and have fun guys.
5:04 "I KNOW", she is definitely Monica 😂
Wished I could have meet u in Amarillo
@nate You look great in a mustache!
I'm with Kara. The mustache looks good.
Yeeeeyyyy how cool!
First and foremost, Thank you for another amazing video! I recognized the outdoor store you were shopping in and your comment of "that hurt" at 15:36ish resonated with me as I use to work for that company. It will benefit you greatly when you "return" the items purchased, when you get to warmer climate or begin heading South. In order to conserve room.  You have 1 year to "return" because the items "did not meet your expectations". As van lifers,  you have to think in terms of modular clothing.  I used to outfit folks for that company and understand function over fashion in addition to savings and investments that will save you over the long haul. Reach out. I can help you.
SHAVE THE MUSTACHE NATE
Shave Nate’s mustache and use the hair for his lil bald spot lol
I’m from Albuquerque, New Mexico. If there wasn’t snow in Santa Fe, we’d go snowboarding in Taos! It’s a great little ski town! Great restaurants too!
Didn't they JUST get all those FREE winter clothes/boots from LL Bean? Ohhhh, it's another brand deal...this time for REI. It seems very wasteful to get all these clothes.
If you need any resources i.e. water fill up, a shower; or recommendations for AZ, let me know! Keep doing what your doing!  Cant wait till the next vid. Love yall!
Nate looks like Dr. Watson of Sherlock Holmes
Um. I take back my like on the previous video.  I've gotten so used to the stash, that I forgot about it  Keep it for your wifey.
You guys should trade your skis for snowboards😂
put a magnet on your gas cap so when you pump gas you can stick your cap right above the opening and never set it down somewhere! <3
Awesome that you take part in veganuary 💪🏼🙏🏼
Awesome video! Just want to make sure you guys are triple vaccinated? I only want to be watching Youtubers who are triple vaccinated and compliant to Health guidelines, and not support neo-nazi Trump-supporting antivax conspiracy theorists 😂
The projects that you both tackle remind me of working with my mom, be it Ikea or some assembly required to minds are better than one. Y’all function great together!
I wanted to go there and just clean your van for you. Such a stress reliever.  Fave lines: "It's a crop top" "I've never loved you more"
This makes me want to buy a van! Pumped on following your new adventures!
As I’m watching there are 32k likes and ZERO dislikes! Yay for positive energy!
Why didn’t you guys buy skis and boots? Wouldn’t that be cheaper since you’re doing it for a while? And then you don’t have to spend time renting everytime you go to a new resort?
I was like "Frommage is French!" then I realised like an idiot that it's the same in Italian. My grandfather was Italian, I'm supposed to know this.
Do you like Zach brown band
Where did you get your cream colored fleece, Kara?  I love it!
Team shave the stache
Noooo.. Please don't shave🥺 u look such a hottie Nate.. Omg this video is just amazing as all other of your videos but it has soooo many cute little moments that make it extra special.. I'll be watching it over and over again.. Thank you so much❤
Nate…. The bad porn stash….. really?
With that stache Nate looks like some dude in a pop punk band.
Damprid will help with condensation inside the van.
I clicked on this cuz i saw nate have a mustache for the second time ever Edit: little did i know i was in for a big suprise.   The van has been ransacked!
Still wonder why you take the poles.... Usually you are a beginner or even just a bit more skilled, it is so much easier without the poles!
Don't forget to subscribe us 😊
Please get rid of the moustache
Awesome video. Loved 😍 traveling videos I too loved too travel ❤️
Anyone else alighting at the fact Kara was wearing the tags still 😂
YESSSSS!!! SHAVE THE STASH!!!! WOOOOOOO😁
Never seen Nate so up and energetic - and he FIXED things, cool! Some of Eamon rub off on ya, 'eh'? Lol LOVED this video, made me want to try skiing AND get Eamon and Bec's e-cookbook. Can't wait til next week! PS Get a new gas tank top NOW, you will lose it when you're in the middle of nowhere!
Man….y’all are just awesome and I will NEVER EVER get tired of watching no matter what y’all are doing!!!
Gas to close to blind!?
Cozy Crocs/Slippers work wonders on my toes in the minivan, but having legit heat in the van is pro. Fun times!
17:20 Nate's smile ❤️❤️
Yes, shave it!
Honestly I don’t like Nate with a bear like its nice i just prefer his without it
i am go skiing so bad
You guys make me smile so much. Thank you for posting and being awesome!
Please get that ( in danish, SKÆG) bear off, it do not fet your face Nate..... 😣😮😕
I dig the slow relaxed ending ☺️💜✌️
You "hey Siri'd" and my phone went off at 3:30AM when I was trying to be incognito while my husband slept LOL.
Isn't Kara so helpful!? hehe
I’ll stick to my meat lol
Thank goodness you guys did this before I brought my van up through New Mexico & Colorado because I NEVER would have thought of the foam floor and I am SOOOO about to install that this week!! Cold feet on the van floor are the worst!! And I'm MUCH less afraid of taking the van through winter weather now. Phew! Thanks y'all!
Hey...you were supposed to shave the cheesy moustache!!! Lol...but really! Or grow the whole goatee.
#Shiryo #2022 🔥🚀💎🙌🏻📈
Love your guys traveling videos makes me want to do more traveling with my man more then what we do now seeing your guys adventures!  Glad I found this channel!
whoever is reading this, GET RIGHT WITH GOD! GOD IS SO AMAZING! TRUST GOD! HAVE FAITH! GOD BLESS!
I agree with Kara don’t shave! Love you both!
this would be nice to do with your significant other
When are you guys going to remodel the van ? Or go up a bigger size…. If you guys even wanna do that !
You guys literally are my light on dark days. 💓
can you guys do an odometer check? id find it interesting seeing how many miles yall have driven
Nate! Don't worry about losing your gas cap, go to amazon and they sell a small rubber coated magnet that sticks to your gas cap via 3M tape. I bought one for my motorcycle gas cap so I can stick it to my bike when filling, there really small don't hinder it while its on and are only about 13 bucks hope this helps.
Great vid! Love the classic VLOG style.
EXCITED !!!
You two are so much fun to watch. Especially love it when you’re doing van life. Please shave mustache.
I’ve stayed in one of the cabins on the hill. It’s absolutely AMAZING! I love Taos in the Winter.
hi!  seasoned Canuck here! love your docudramas :-D  I look forward to them  along with Eamon and Bec's.  FYI, the frost on your wind screen can be averted by circulating the heat in the van with a small fan. or you get an in car heater if you don't have windscreen defrost in vehicle.  there small fans for offices that plug into USB ports or an ac outlet. they even have a clip you can attach them to a ledge or a visor.
What is up Nate and Kara!?!?! Ohhh my it is so fun to know y’all drove thru where I live 😛!! I love watching you guys!!! Thank you for passing thru yellow city!!! Y’all have a great trip!!!!!
Go back to eating real cheese. You are awesome to watch but real cheese is better then all fake cheese.
Like the mustache, must keep, why, because, just like a sailing boat, needs it's captain, a captain needs it's mustache 😀
thumbs up for kara to get some implants
Kara, as you go up in altitude the temperature water boils at goes down. That means it takes longer to heat your food up.
Bru lose the mustache
"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten son, that whosoever believes in him shall not perish but have everlasting life." -John 3:16(bible) "the wages of sin is death"-Bible. Therefore God the judge has given man the death sentence due to man's sin, but because of God's mercy, he gave himself(god incarnate/jesus)to die on a cross for the sins of the world. That means he paid our fine and if we trust in him God can legally let us go guilt free in court/judgment day and have everlasting life with Him!  "Go and sin no more!"-Jesus
Guys when you’re in Arizona let me know if love to show you some awesome local stuff around the state that you’ll never believe is actually here!!!
16:05 Kara was like, heck no not again 🏃🏻‍♀️💨
Yayyy Amarillo Texas!!
Try snowboarding…sooo much more fun imo…quick edit, Nate loves her lots b/c vegan cheese is torture.
whenever i’m sad or have a bad day or week and you guys post my day or week gets so much better and you guys are so funny it helps me so much
Great Vlog👍, loved seeing you guys trying to readjust to van life! FYI, you can get large diameter PVC tubes/pipes used for water drainage, put the screw on caps made for it on the ends and attach it to the van roof, or standing upright on the rear doors, to store your skis and poles out of the way so you get to keep the shower! You're going to want to seal the opening of your grey water tank replacement so it doesn't slosh water out going around turns and bumps. Get a piece of rubber sheet (Lowes: "Keeny" 6 inch rubber washer $2.48) cut an opening slightly smaller than the tube so it stays tight around it and clamp it to the jug opening. No leaks or splashes! ....OVER! lol! 🤣
Omg! Watch that gray water level real close! I can only imagine the mess from sloshing while driving!   And we learned about diesel engines freezing at Winter Park last year. Not fun. Don’t forget to treat the fuel. :-/
It’s -20 feel like -28 where I am 👁👄👁
Kara: “there’s no way this is all fitting in there” Nate: “huh” i died!!! that was so funny
the canadians laughing at -2 and -6 lmao
Does anyone else get the warm and fuzzies watching Kara and Nate?! 😍 I can't wait to do vanlife!
Good times!! Thanks for sharing.. as you head through SoCal - take a stop in Temecula our Wine Country (50+ wineries) 45 min north of San Diego.. keep up the entertaining videos for us. Cheers
Wanna consider an ultra trail race around San Diego area before heading south. There are a few 50k and 50miles races in the area 😁
Right now for me in canada it's - 20
After several months it's nice to see you back on the road again...
Ski van lol
Love the rugged sky van! I’m from San Diego you guys are going to love it here!! Go to mission bay! I have extra paddle boards if you guys want to paddle here!
Love you kara and Nate. Sorry Nate ditch the stache. Looking like one of the Super Mario bros. Lol jk. Ps the fine you got, made me not want to go to some National Parks. Ttyl xoxo.
Pop would be so proud of y’all ❤️
You won't regret spending the money for your Patagonia jacket. I have worn this brand for decades. My current puffer coat is one that I've been wearing for the last ten years, and it's still going strong. So when you spread the cost of the coat over a lifespan of 10–15 years, then the brand is a great value.
Stop In Pueblo!!
Nate: it's a crop top  He said on a annoying voice got me laughing so hard
Amarillo Texas! You were at my neighborhood Lowe’s. Literally 1 mile away from my house. You missed the snow. We had a dusting today. Glad to see you on the road again!
The mustache ages him so much😭
What's with the pornstash nate?
I do not like the mustache (no hate tho)
Yuck
I love your YouTube videos and my mom always once when she retires she wants to explore the world
FOR THE UNDERSINK TANK: Just take a cheap led flashlight, connect two wires, one to the internal battery spring and tape another wire to the other terminal inside of the flashlight. the other end of one wire, tape to one end of a battery and a 3rd, separate wire to the opposite end of the battery (whatever battery you would typically use in the flashlight being used). you now have two ends of wire, a -/+. tape the ends to the full line inside of the water tank. When the water level rises enough to touch both wires, you flashlight will light up and you'll know to stop running the water before the tank overflows. just a quick and easy thought. about 7-10 minutes to do.
Thanks 4 taking us along on your adventures. I really enjoy them
Nice stash😂😂😂😂
Guy's I'm your biggest fan!! And hearing that you guys are trying veganuary....it made even more big fan of yours. Thanks for choosing kindness at least for one month
Based on the shower conversation I realise I need to start recording all of our caravan fixit conversations so when my ideas are the right ideas, I can just play them back without having to say ‘I told you so’ 😀
Missed these kind of travel vlog ❤️ ❤️ ❤️
Two things:  1. I’M SO EXCITED TO FOLLOW YOU ON THIS TRIP!!  2. Did you join the REI Co-op?! It’s $20 for a lifetime and their return policy is AMAZING!!! (Honestly, return anything within a year and you get dividends back at the end of the year for full price items… it’s a win WIN!!)   Did I make my excitement clear enough?! Lol! ;o)
Y'all are so much fun. I voted shave. When I saw the thumbnail which is the size of my thumbnail.... I said whose that guy. Oh... OH!!!! The shave gods have answered. Kara you are a natural on the slopes. I love your bravery. Not so much your stove lighting skills. 🤣 Great video as usual. Be safe 💕
PLEASE PUT SOME ANTIFREEZE IN YOUR EXISTING GREY WATER TANK!
Ah, love this adventure so far! :) can’t wait to keep watching. I’ve been binging your channel for a couple of months now and I’m finally all caught up from beginning to present. Love your channel.
Hi Kara and Nate! Love your channel and been subscribed for a while now. I have a channel in Colorado and spend the winters filming ski footage. If you ever want someone to come along and film you guys skiing or want to go ride I'd be more than happy to help! Best wishes and I hope to hear from you both!
Nate, 1972 is calling and they want their mustache back!
i love your van videos! where I live it’s about -30 during night time.
Not sure if this has been answered, but as a fellow full timer how much propane are you using to stay warm??
You guys are doing great at skiing!
stay happy, watching your videos makes the day better
Yes please shave!
Safe travels….your both awesome!
I love Kara’s matching jogger and sweatshirt outfit at the end 🥺❤️ looks sooo comfy! Definitely need to find a dupe asap
I'ma were a patchy lip fur because I need a thing I am so hard to place
These people are like if soggy bread was a person the most bland unspecial  un-unique thing to exist
How bout a Kara and Nate afterdark? Just sayin
Kara won project #2 FOR SURE. ATTA GIRL!!
Unsure if you mentioned this in another video, but did you buy your own skis and boots? Do you have any recommendations?
What brand is that hoodie Nate is wearing?
Nate, dude, off with the mustache. It’s not a good look for you.
Nate, dude, shave the mustache!
I use those foam squares down in my basement floor and they work great.
"I love you so much id walk up a hill for you" THAT is true love! hahahaa
"Oh I can wear my tye dye hoodie!"..."It's a crop top" about had me rolling on the floor 😂
Veganuary, you make my heart 😃
I like the ’stache since this is the first video I watched with you having it. I’m with Kara, sorry to see it go.
Nice job skiing.  One piece of ski advice for anyone that is buying a new ski gear get either a bright helmet or jacket.  Helps keep your fam together and able to see each other.   If you are out on a busy Saturday you would not believe how much black gear there is.
That burner is awfully close to the curtain. You guys might want to do something about that.
I think I like the mustache
y’all were right by my house! if only i’d known haha! ❤️❤️
To be honest, I'm going to miss the mustache. Maybe keep it just a little bit longer?
I have to say the mustache looks so much better when you have mirrored eyes and high collars, sort of like a race car driver.  Could you be at an altitude where water doesn't boil as fast as at lower altitudes?  Seriously, the stache looks goofy.
Can I ask a question. How in the fuck you not work for 2 months and still have money. Must be nice
Healthy cheese is NOT orange. There is no such thing as naturally orange cheese. You are eating food coloring, and other junk.
Have you guys ever been to El Paso?
I love Charlie (Chad lol) when do we ever get to see him again??
I've missed Charlie in your vlogs!! Always a lot of humour when he took part in your vlogs! So cool that you are still in touch!
I only watch your channel intermittently, but I always wish you the best on your adventures. Plus You have never done anything to put me off watching you, which is why I always come back after a period of watching other content on yt. Looking forward to this season!
My husband died 2 months ago and I have been binge watching you guys. Thanks for the distraction. You guys are the best.
SABATON - Soldier Of Heaven (Official Music Video)  https://youtu.be/LYI3eegIJlI
Nate! Nate! Nate! There's a caterpillar on your lip!
Stay warm! It’s -20* F where I’m at right now!
If you need a place to park in Mesa Az, our driveway and electricity is all yours!! 😁
i decided to rewatch this and IT WAS RIGHT AFTER my father came home from work and told me he got walmart crocs and then I turned back to the video and it was the exact pair Nate showed 😭
Excited to see your adventures to Baja. @MrandMrsAdventure just got there too. Hope your paths cross.😀
So how does the Athletic Greens really taste?  I'm wanting to try it but really don't want to spend the money on it if I have to gag it down.  I really wish there was a way to get a free sample so I could try it.
PS. Please do a video if you will be going to RAGBRAI so I can keep a look out for you guys while on the ride to say hi! 😀
YAY for Veganuary!! I found you through Eamon & Bec. Good job!!!!
Signing up for RAGBRAI THANKS TO YOU 2! I hope to see you there and that I can get to meet my 2 favorite youtubers! We have been fans for a long time! I'm skipping Oshgosh this year and my hubby will be throwing me out in Iowa cuz I said I'm doing this no matter what! Lol 😆  Thank you for being so awesome. We always look to your videos before we travel!! Thank you!!!
I was very excited watching this video! 😁 I live in santa fe nm and you guys are by far my favorite youtubers!
Wow 2 million subscribers feels like yesterday you were only at 200k
thank you for the added subs of the celcius conversion! definitely made me less confused than usually when talking abt weather haha
Happy 2022. Back to your brilliant best.. the rest did you  both so good. Fab video 👌
I live in toas crazy you were here !!
I’m so happy I found this channel.
Why the terrible mustache???
Hoping the long videos stay!!! Highlight of my week
2.85 million followers making millions and u decide to live in a van? why not live in a bathroom? 😂
undies come off while on the lift. its a thing. jus sayin'. Well done guys, shave it.
Not Nate not getting the Friends reference 😂
folks who r thrifty with  $ always look for the good deals. Good on ya!
where does the shower drain?
I really liked this video!!  It is cool to see van life on the road and behind the scenes.  The skiing looks so cool 😎 you make me want to do it!!!!  Do you know if the snow melts in the summer there?
Please come to india,,, love from kerala
seal your grey tank for smell?
I have enjoyed watching your videos for the past 4 years. You have inspired me to travel the world and I bought a minivan to travel around the US. You are such a joy to watch and I learn so much. I’m even working diligently on becoming a digital nomad. Keep up the good work.
I cheered for you when the shower purposefully didn’t work! Haha, you guys are awesome :)
Don't shave your mustache, Nate!
There has never been a more convenient place to park for home improvement projects. Total van life win.
Couldn't you put antifreeze in the grey water tank?
Nate keep the stacheeeeeeeee!
kara is such a goddess!! amazing content as usual we love you two!! also keep the stash man
Mustache does not look good.
“Who’s Monica?” 😂😂
I miss the coffee intros 🥺
Everyone getting Crocs
you're both so tan and freckly from being in Mexico! :)
Can’t wait till you get rid of that caterpillar above your lip.😝🐛
Love you both. Hope it’s ok that I report spammy porn comments for you.
Cut the beard 🧔 off
Do either a full beard of shave. Moustache ain’t working
Omg when Nate said hey Siri what’s the weather, mine turned on and told me the weather for my area lol oh funny
Fahrenheit is so stupid like -4 is -20 in celsius
This is soooo cute how you get impressed with cold weather! I'm in Quebec Canada right now and tonight it's gonna go down to - 38°C 🥶🥶. Hope you had a great trip!! Big fan here!!! 😁
I probably have a generator for sure.
12!!!!! Trend!!!!!
Woohooo you came to my hometown I hope you liked Taos! Taos is expensive too! They remade it a few years ago, but hopefully you enjoyed your stay!
Nate do you ever get told you look like Cristiano Ronaldo? Good heart as well.
Ok the mustache stays ?     What's up with that?
I missed Charlie so much! He needs to come visit soon.
That view looks so beautiful ❄️
Anyone else catch the illuminati pose in the thumbnail? These guys are frauds but what did you expect? You're not fooling anyone. Souls were sold
Shave it shave it!! 😊
Kara:”oh I can wear my tie dye hoodie!!!”  Nate: “….it’s a crop top 🥴”  WHEN I TELL YOU I LOLED. Hahahah I needed that laugh 🤍
You guys quickly became one of my FAV YouTubers to watch. My days fee complete when I get to live vicariously through you guys! Can’t wait to see what this year holds for you guys! 🤍🤍🤍
You won't loose the gas cap if you buy a replacement  now. That's the way it works.
I could’ve swore i saw y’all while i was there!! I was like no lots of people have vans nowadays. Ugh I’m so mad i didn’t say hi!!
Hey. Top Tip. There is usually a slot on the gas flap for the cap to slot into while you fill up. That way you won't misplace it.
God, i cant Get over how much joy this video gives me. One day I wanna start my own vanlife
I love skiing and I was so happy when you guys said about this ski trip ❤️⛷⛷ Can I give you some skiing tips?  - before you start skiing make a little like  5 minutes warmup for your legs, arms and neck. It helps a lot  - if you’re still skiing for 2 months it will be helpful for you to get a ski instructor that you can get your technique better  - don’t be afraid to try more steep slopes because if you’re just gonna use what you’ve learned and you don’t panic it will all go smooth and if you’re gonna look back at what slope you’ve just been on you will be proud of yourself  - enjoy every single part of this trip  Ps: yes Kara, the jacket is a little too long for skiing but it’s ok 😊🙃 Lots of love and support from Romania ❤️🇷🇴⛷⛷
Great vid! Love the classic VLOG style.
I was already in the process of taking a bite of my lunch as soon as Nate mentioned mold. Thanks Nate loll
I hooked up with Eamon and Bec because of you. As a Canadian thanks for mentioning them  and also putting the temps in Celsius lol great vlog. Enjoy be safe
That 'stache has got to go... LOL
I feel like this is the life Nate has wanted in the van since you guys bought it, haha.
Lovely video! I was smiling through the skiing parts and Nate you look good with the moustache! 👨🏽
OK!  Love  it! I haven't read the comments yet, and I am only at 21:23, So I don't know what's going to happen,  but right now I am thinking it is too cold for Diesel fuel (it stars to becomes  gel like), and thinking you might have problems to start up the van. Sooo exiting, too cold for diesel or not?  lets see hitting play now....
I need a SLV and Kara and Nate crossover
Hey glad to see a new video you made and you came to my home state of New Mexico. I came across your guys channel and am going through and watching all your videos. Keep up the good work. Also just a reminder when you are at altitude it will take longer for things to boil than they will at sea level.
Keep the ‘stach!
To old Hole for the grey water, just have it shut with a opening, going down a road Without a tailing car, dump it.. its grey, not sewage.. just buy Sailyacht cleaning materials and its licensed & healthy for nature
9:40 I did not know Kara has a belly piercing it looks so nice!!
The audio on this video is awesome!!! Also, are yall still completing the 50 states goal?
I just love you guys so much
Y’all should make an onlyfans
If u have ice in the inside u have bad inselation
We used that padded floor in our living room on the hard wood floors.  We put it under our rug and it makes all the difference in the world.  You could also put carpet on top of it in your van and when it gets dirty you just shake them out.  We did that in our van as well.  So much nicer than muddy floors and when it gets old, we just toss the carpet.
Fun.
I was literally in this ski valley during the summer! I did some geologic mapping for a class. it is so cool to see you guys there!
dont forget all the ceiling space you guys have above your bed!!!
Sorry Kara, but that stash has to go! 😂😭
I'm with Nate on the vegan cheese. I've been dairy-free since 2012 and I *still* don't think vegan cheese tastes good. It's weirdly sweet.
Wish you guys made it to Michigan.
Look at y’all go!!! Love y’all, prayers and love towards your 2022 travels!!! 🥰
First of all, love you two. Second, not saying this to be snarky but I think vegan cheese tastes better when you think about the harm to animals and the planet that animal cheese causes. Animals go through torture for dairy products from being forcibly impregnated to having their babies taken away. They cry for them for days. I am of course speaking on factory farms which is where most dairy products come from. I hope you can continue your plant based journey beyond January and maybe someday be vegan for the animals. ❤
The tofu/noodle/peanut butter dish from their book is TO DIE FOR ... nice and quick, super simple, but SO TASTY
Could you please give the link for ryan & Beck's youtube channel
Love u two  You inspired me to start my own channel and start blogging !!!
Loved seeing you back in your van. Have fun.
Hello Kara and Moustasche Man 😁 In this comment I act like a norwegian frozen wannabe expert: When you put that padding on the wooden floor,  be sure no moist/ water goes under it.  It might not evaporate fluids and can create mold underneath. Maybe just air the floor often. And for the bathroom:  a big bucket/basket with a coolander? could collect water so it doesnt run into the drain frozen shut/ the pipes breaking because water freezing inside them.  Happy travels and greetings from 🇳🇴 🖖
I would have attached the skis To the ceiling with clamps.
💚💚
Loved this one!
Vegan but eating cheese 🤣
Nate I love ya but No No No on that stash. That is not you  FYI: the family 18 kids and counting show, showed that you can go the a goodwill in ski country and get all the ski suits and clothes for super cheap and they are super cute
Don’t shave the mustache. Go to a man salon and have someone shape it up.
SO FUN!!! omg though...that curtain behind the cook top freaks me out! it's so close to the flame!
ya'll gotta come up to montana and ski Big Sky! I guarantee i can take you on a longer green (or blue) than you've ever done!
I just watched ur video this the 2nd one, keep them coming, are you living in the van Permanently??😱😱
When Nate was holding the crocks, I totally thought he was holding Kara's feet and I was like "ummm I think Kara is in trouble being in that position" haha
Cheesy 1970’s porn stach has to go!!
I think you need norwegian wool underwear. when its cold it keeps you warm, when you're too warm it cools you down and it helps with sweat. its very thin and goes underneath most clothes.
Awesome video as always but I have to say Nate, the moustache isn't for you mate (in my opinion)
I loved you guys before but love you even more now that you're being such great role models for the plant based way of life. Way to go guys! From your South African fan living in Seattle.
As someone who has lived in NM my whole life it is so nice to see people highlight the good here.  ❤️
I tried to watch Eman and bec but I just don't enjoy watching them like I do with yall videos.  I love yall personality and life spirit. You guys are literally the best. And also anytime bec gets a chance, it seems she likes to throw shade on kara. Like a jealously thing. Anyways,, I don't like watching amen and bec. Yalls videos are way better watch!!!!! I love you guys so much.  #1 biggest fan
Hey there, KARA and NATE.     I have a question if you have time.  A while ago you had a sponsor , an airline price saving company.     Can you please repeat the name of that company if you have time?    Thanks 😊
Exhaust leak or was that your rockers knocking?
To the point about being Ok with a mess once it gets to a certain point, I am watching this on my couch surrounded by the remnants from my thanksgiving travel while propping my feet on my still fully packed Christmas suitcase as an ottoman and I am eating frozen food that has been in my freezer since covid started. CHEERS! This is the bad place.
NOT THE MUSTACHE DONT DO IT
Nate bro I feel you my wife’s the same don’t trust our handy work
The human body has teeth which will chew meat and a digestive system which digests meat for a reason. The human body evolved this way because the brain and body needs the aminos. protein, etc.... that we get from meat.  Do not have to like it but it is science.  I was having issues years ago.  A college teacher explained my being a vegan was hurting me not helping and explained why.  It makes sense like it or not.  Fish and whole eggs have choline which is great for the brain.  Not egg whites,  the yolk is great for the brain.
Most of our casinos in NM will allow overnight parking. Tesuque is one of the new ones. Right next to you there is the Opera. The skiing going up to and past High Park is good. There is also great skiing in Taos, NM which is 72 miles north of Santa Fe. In Colorado there is Wolf Creek pass near Pagosa Springs, CO that has great hot springs. Then continuing east of Pagosa is Durango and Telluride that have good skiing too. Enjoy our state.
Love you guys And I really love that living in a confined space and being together all the time doesn't make you two irritated of each other  Your relationship and life style really makes me wanna live in a van
i ate in december only vegan food so it is veganber
You should try to do a "January National Carnivore Month" instead, it would be better for your health. Meat is the most nutrient dense food on the planet. You don't even have to make a choice between your health or the planet health because regenerative agriculture is the best way to save the planet from intensive agriculture (like soy, wheat, almond, avocado and CAFO meat) and yourself from highly (vegan) processed food like the genuine faux cheese in the grilled cheese). But I understand that you want to help your friends sell their new book. 🙂
YES!!!!! SHAVE THAT THING!!!!!
Bruh dude you look like Cristiano Ronaldo
Y'all need better knives!
why d u blur brands?
So glad you’re getting rid of the 70’s porn stache!
I like how she shows herself FULL FORGIVENESS for the times life is messy and her mindset allows her to not get upset, knowing full well she’s capable to tackle it at any time.
Your window blind beside the gas cooker is a serious fire hazard. I would advise you guys install a backsplash of some kind. Great vid!
I can't stop looking at Nates mustasch!
Kara and Nate up to #5 on trending. You guys deserve it !!
You should try make the “ski locker “ into a confession room
Great vlog as always! Shave it! Lol!
Nooooo we love ur mostacheeeee
Dehumidifiers help a ton for moisture inside the camper!  Not sure if you guys have room though lol
Fun!
Love following the two of you! Is there any way to block all the porn trolls that are inundating your posts? YouTube needs to get with the program!
Love how you add things you have already done to the to-do list just to check them off.  I do the same thing
😆 lol nate you still have your mustache! Then at the end I see your shaving it off. Kara says no I say "yay"!  But to be honest I was getting used to it now and it looks very becoming. 😊😘 Great job on the vegan diet 👏 👍 and skiing looked so fun.  Love you two!!!
Kara and Nate hope you had fun.  Thank You for sharing.
Can i just say how happy you guys make me❤️
Oh my, the mustache is still there!!! YES-the next video with mustache shaved!!!
Kara was Monica for the first part
I like the mustache on, keep it, please 👨🏻
Glad to see you guys back in action. Love the winter videos!  That being said...my wife and I are pretty sure YouTube is making/paying you two to hangout/advertise for "those other two", and we can't roll our eyes hard enough whenever they come up. I get why that might seem like the way to go, but trust me that your audience is probably into your channel for your particular flavor...it feels much less organic than your recent diet. 💎 Don't let them rub off on you.
don’t shave it
Assalamu'alaikum Salam dari Indonesia 🇮🇩
You can only shave the stash if you do it in the reflection of pops hub cap.
I didn't even recognize Nate with that mustache. Had to look down at who's video it was.
Why do not just move on to a place where is summer and make it easy on your selves 🤭
Damn is that Gabby Petito right there??
Kara was literally carrying everything and Nate from behind carries three things and two of those fell 😂😂😂 love you guys
Be careful with the back burner and the fire, that makes me nervous 😬 happy and safe travels!!!!
Where was everybody else - before the last run?
Loving this road trip!  Heck I love your life!
Haven’t seen this channel in a while you guys don’t look healthy maybe should take a break and what’s w the pornstar stache?
Are you at Angel Fire?
great adventure 😀
ha flagstaff anybody else clock it on the map ? isnt that were casper the friendly ghost is at?
When this video started…. Your “STASCH” jumped out at me…. Happy the fungus is to be removed!   Now we will see if Kara can change the will of all of us!! 😁😃😂🤣😀❣️💕
I love you guys!! I wish we were friends in real liiiife!!!!
Great job guys. Just wondering why you bought all black clothes? A little color on the slopes is quite nice😊
I watched Emon and Bec just before this. i was in stiches. now to see kara tearing up with laugher is priceless!
Just want to say that I love your videos and you two inspired my wife and I to start vlogging our travels! We now plan to  sell our house and start traveling full time in the next few months. Thanks for bringing these awesome adventures to the world! Also so happy that you are participating in Veganuary. I participated in Veganuary in 2019 and have now been vegan since.
I want to live my last years of life in a moving van and want to enjoy life
Omg kara I really like your necklace!  where did you buy it? 😍 So happy to have this 30min vlog 🥰
Loving how you are showing vegan recipes! Just had a vacation with my partner in a ski town and it is so hard to find vegan food at restaurants. Cooking on the vacation really helped us to not go hungry. Thank you!
KEEP THE STASH
Ok so I need to know something...are they talking to Charlie hunnam the celebrity!???bc he is my biggest crush ever!!!???
Why don't you guys try to convince one of the major Motorhome makers to offer you a free or super subsidized one... They would probably do it because of the free publicity ... and you guys would get a much more livable vehicle than your current hard to live in van...
1:38 far out, your voices are almost exactly the same 😂😂😂
I've noticed something different about this one. Seems like you aren't presenting your experience. It's more  in the flow. No frills. Your evolving and some other deep stuff, lol. The undertree was pretty funny.
I really was hoping we’d seen the last of the van once you guys went back abroad…but any Kara and Nate is great Kara and Nate 😊
Yay!!! Charlie is around!  So happy to see him!
I was watching this entire video asking my self “didn’t we vote that mustache off?”😂
Im sure you can hang the fuel cap on the fuel cap door. Most german vans/cars have this feature, becuase leaving it handing isnt very ordly!
I’m so embarrassed for you about the knock off crocks😂😂
It’s snowing here it never does
Kara - where is your cozy outfit from? The one you took the tags off because you weren't sure if you liked it. It looks great and now I need one! More info, please!  Also i like his mouth beard it looks good on him haha
I love watching your guys' vidoes they're always so positive! I saw you guys had The Bucket List on your front seat in the vid, it would be awesome if you guys shared some of your favorite books you've read in the past little while. Have fun and be safe on the slopes!
Ai live in Norvei end its so so kold. -29
One of your better Vlogs. Prefer just watching what you’re doing without the fancy B-Roll and stupid transitions that some are now trying to do. Don’t be like everyone else and get an Editor - it will change how you come across and you will lose viewers. I hope Eamon and Becs Vlogs stay authentic after they get an editor. I know it’s hard work editing but you guys keep it real and it’s very enjoyable to watch.
Wait what’s ur shower drain going to?  Same problem as sink?
As I am leaving to go ski on Monday for a week this has increased my anticipation.
Nate need to loose the mustache bud, lol
Getting serious Craig Holmes from Kinging It ✌🏼vibes from Nate with that moustache!!
Those fuzzy crocks changed my life lol. Sooo ugly so comfortable!!
Kara - "I'm kind of like Monica..."  Me - "Huh?"
Thankyou for putting the Celsius as well! We currently have 38C/100F temps in Australia 🇦🇺 your vlog makes me miss the cold so much
Shave it! 💪   😂 it’s fine but I really like Nate better without the mustache 😜😁
Okay, listen up, when you make it down to Cabo, head to BURRITOS EL SACRIFICIO, get there early and fill up, the food is amazing.
dude, lose the stache. not a good look.
so excited to see you guys on the road
I grew one of those moustaches last month. My partner said she’s cancelling the wedding unless I shave it off 😂
"Forgiveness is divine but never pay full price for late pizza" - Michelangelo Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
Amazing! I've sat watching this when I've sat eating my first official vegan meal, I've switched to dairy free milk and yoghurt today too, mainly because of following Eamon and Bec too! I feel really proud of myself so I hope you guys are too!
Good morning from Minnesota!! It is-14F here this morning.   Glad you stayed cozy in your Van! There's something satisfying about surviving in the cold. 😉
I have those "crocs" too! They are super comfy.
Ok Nate since you mentioned the moustache first I’m creeped out by it,come back baby face Nate 🤣😂
It has been a year since we moved from Santa Fe NM to Portugal. So nice to see some of the old stomping grounds. So far our winter here in Alentejo has looked more like spring with flowers and trees beginning to bloom. If you get a chance to go to the farmer's market in Santa Fe it is the best.
-6? Lol not bad.. im used to-40 winters
Love this video so much! I’ve missed the two of you together. “It’s a crop top” “let’s go gambling” 😂 just my two favourite Americans!
So cool
I am really not a skier (even though I am from a Nordic country), but this made me want to go skiing🤩
Thanks for sharing your lives! I look up to you as a couple. Looooved this! 💙💙💙
What an amazing video! I have fallen In love with you guys and I’m exited to watch your Journey over the next two months ☺️
You guys going too telluride?
As great as this is, and it really is another great video, my favourite part is the conversion to Celsius! THANK YOU!! :) It makes it that much better :) Greetings from South Africa.
15:53 I love how Kara is wearing a jacket with a tag on it 😂
Hahha as I'm watching this it is currently -11 degrees f.
You still keep those Tibetan flag😍❤️
redundant comment. You 2 have become such interesting personalities to watch no matter what you do. Thanks for the content!
Why does Nate look like mustach mannn lol
27:03  Nate, is that the tag still on your jacket??
I loved this video!!!! I can't wait to see  Kara turning on the stove again 😂   Can I say though, and this might totally be a perspective thing, but the window cover on the door looked dangerously close to the flame as Kara cooked that last dinner. Please be safe 🙏🙏🙏🙏
So fun!! Enjoy your snowy trip!!
Great video! Love watching when coming home from school make me so happy! ❤ keep being you
noo...dont shave the mustache...i personally like it and wud prefer you to not shave it off since you look good in it
Is part of this trip to get some of the states yall haven't done yet? Just wondering?
Great video but missed the change of state like New Mexico yell
don't shave plz
Is nate going too shave his mustach
I loved this new vlog style guys!
Hey guys!  I really love your videos. Can't wait to see you skiing :) Really can't believe you are doing veganuary. I have some videos with vegan ideas if you are interested. Sending you tons of love! Have a good ride!
Did you winterize the outside mounted water tank so the plastic doesn’t crack? Just checking…
Tip- boil water in your kettle first and then pour in into the pot to boil, because it’s already at a higher temperature it won’t take as long to boil as soon temperature.
Aye January 8 that my birthday
Guys, you are awesome!!! Skiing is so much fun!!! It is amazing that you may stay in your own country and drive for a few hours and you are skiing in the mountains! So cool
The first ride is ALWAYS really shit and everything hurts. Each time I think; WHAT am I this bad, does it hurt THIS much. And then all the next rides are 100% better! Looking good! :D
Hey Kira and Nate.Simon here from Australia.Love watching all your videos.Just been watching your latest video and I have noticed Your gas cooker is quite close to your blind.Just wondering are your blinds fire proof.Just a little concerned.Keep up the good work guys.😊
When Nate said you got the last lift for the night a movie popped in my head lol Check out the skiing movie called frozen not the cartoon with Elsa and Olaf
The next Brian and gabby! 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Dislike the chapters!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Shaveeeeeeeeee
Sacrilege! You had posh cheese toastie without tomatoe soup to dip in!
Another one of my favourite videos. We’re in the middle of Summer where I am but I’m a Winter baby. I miss the cold/cozy vibes 🥺 loved this video!!!!!
ROFL the "green" runs at Taos are not so green.
I thought Rei changed their name
Mexico is a bad idea... period.
love you two!!!
Damn 😍 this is absolutely amazing vlog guys
Thanks for taking us along your trips. Love your vlogs.
@Nate: what Patagonia Jacket do you wear?
I think you should get everything out and nothing in the van and start from scratch or buy a new one. Because I don't think this van is you guys, ask Eammon and Bec  they would love to help, they do great designs.
As I watch this #9 on trending. Well that makes sense cuz THIS WAS A BANGAR !! Haha. Safe Travels Amigos
I can't deal with the mustache lol
When Kara and Nate go do what we love doing the most! 🥰 ⛷ Greetings from the Netherlands!
ATHLETIC GREENS IS PEOPLE!!!
Guys im worried!! You have linen blinds behind the fire stove, like really close to the fire :( i know youre all hotties and like hotness  inside the van but please dont burn that van. Use metal plate between fire and blinds. Love and peace x
My favorite part is when Kara says, "I can wear my tie dye hoodie!" and Nate responds, "That's a crop top!" because that's a conversation I've had with my boyfriend before!
Word of Advise Stay away from Albuquerque. BTW welcome to them land of entrapment. Come on vacation Get stuck on Probation.
I think Nate can be a better rapper than Kara. Sorry ghorl. LOL Kidding.
Love your vlogs but…. Nate’s moustache is a bit disgusting….
How is Nate's health?
15:57 Kara, rockin' the price tag under her armpit. ;)
And this video is sponsored by Eamon and Bec! Great video loved the “add it to the list so we can cross it off”
Is the curtain not a bit too close to the cooker?? My OCD just can't get past the image of your van going up in flames. Please be careful!!
Nate is so handsome in his mustache! 🥸
You guys should add the Molly Kathleen Mine tour in Cripple Creek and a trek to the Alpine Tunnel next trip to Colorado. Always enjoy watching your videos, keep up the good work.

My favorite part is when Kara says, "I can wear my tie dye hoodie!" and Nate responds, "That's a crop top!" because that's a conversation I've had with my boyfriend before!
I am starting van life tomorrow! I am starting in Montana and it's COLD!!!
I miss the humor and shenanigans of Charlie. I was wondering when he would be back on your videos. Have a fun trip. Love watching your adventures.
I love the thumbnails on your guys videos, Your also super inspiring
Grey water fix, NONO NO NO NOOOOOOOOOO, smelly grey water smells will result in your van. Use the lid from the NEW blue container with a seal on the new flexi waste pipe.
Hey guys! Long time vegan here and happy you are going for it.  Just so you know, fake cheese and fake meat and all the other processed vegan food is being "junk food" vegan. If you were to stay the course you would stop eating these things. They aren't healthy and they don't taste great. Have a great time.
I have a pair of Walmart Crocs and they are the best! They're basically Crocs and I seriously wear them all the time
Great video!! I need to check out that app Nate was talking about for when I start my solo traveling. Also, hearing the "over" on your phone call reminded me of talking to my dad back in the 80s at the military base's MARS station when he was oversees.
Nate I appriciate your mustache, it is great 👌🏽😉
Love you guys!  Kara, your laugh cracks me up. ( In a good way )
Try sticking bubble wrap on the window to see if it helps with condensation for the van.  Understand it’s helps with heat loss, too.
Charlie came my mind the other day and was wondering if he would be joining you again. Looking forward to that adventure.
You guys are sooo wholesome 🥺
That was a awesome adventure thanks for sharing 👏🏽👏🏽👍👍❄❄❄👍👍☕☕☕☕⛷⛷⛷❤
Nate looks cute in beard😉
village person on the road
Yay Charlie! We’ve missed him.
Nate, you're confusing us with your mustache-removal dilemma. You had a beard in the 1st video of 2022, then in the previous video it was gone, and now it looks like you grew it in a  week. We are only 20 days into 2022. Edit: I wrote this comment halfway through the video when I noticed the mustache. I just got to the end and realized well ...
Great video! The whole time I was watching,  I was trying to think of a comment to write that would get Nate to shave that hideous  face  fuzz. Thank God  for the 90k likes!!
Omg- its only -6 for yall??? for me its -20 on a daily basis
I’m so damn proud of you guys…living the dream…I love the stache…Kara you’re a joy as always…thanks for bringing smiles and smiles and smiles xoxo
Haha, I thought Monica was the caterpillar above your mouth Nate 😂😉😜
https://youtu.be/6EnNiug2o0g  The moustache…
Nate can look like a hipster barista. Just needs a beanie and glasses 👓 🤣
Keep the mustache. You look more mature.
Gentle reminder that OCD is a debilitating condition, not a casual interest in cleanliness or organization.
Shave the Mo!!! Yes!!!
Joke. How do you know if somebody is vegan.?????? Don’t worry they will tell you.
Whoop Whoop  - back in the van.  This almost feel like the good all traveling days.  Cannot wait to see what this year has install for you guys.   Exciting times.   And thanks again for a really enjoyable "real" video.
Don't shave!!
I forgot the -6 was cold... cuz it was -28 this morning and I still walked to school lol
This video was amazing (As always) but so happy to see it trending so high!!! Everyone should jump on board for this adventure!
How do y’all get wifi everywhere???
The stash needed to go, Nate.  Glad y o u got 90,000 likes to remove it. Looks like y'all are living and eating great.  I think it was smart to put foam down on the floor.  Foam installation on next van,maybe?  Have fun til next week.
So over AG1.  So many influences promoting it.
FYI eating meat is more healthy than eating vegan foods .
so excited to see you guys on the road
All I want is for Nate to keep his mustache.
amazing
Violife is not the one you should base your expectations of Vegan cheese on. :) At least not in Europe. There are so many better brands
Awesome..Please shave your moustache Nate. You look so good clean shaven :)
So excited you guys are trying veganuary!!! Cherry on top for an already lovely couple 🥰
That "curtain" in the door behind the cooker looks like living a dangerous life with that short distance to the fire on the cooker.
So. Much. Fun. 😁❄️👍
when you said “hey siri what’s the weather” it activated my homepod and it scared the life out of me lol
Love your videos…. but the mustache, has to go. I’m sorry “Stache” fans, but I just end up looking at it like a mole on your grandmas face. It haunts me.
I could literally watch them all day. I love them and their content so much. They honestly need their own TV show haha. Please never stop being yall, and living life to the fullest. You guys truly inspire me!
Congrats on getting all those likes on the last video…….hallelujah, you’re shaving that mustache off!!!
0:22    21F**  19:20 as well lol
Vegan is an native American word for LOUSY HUNTER 😉
Dude ...I love you but you've got to lose the mustache. Either grow a beard or lose the caterpillar
1. I love you.  2. I will watch no matter what. 3. Thank you for the RAGBRAI coverage. I'm an Iowan transplanted in Texas and miss Iowa so much.  4. Please. Shave the mustache.
Using ( almost )  pure alcohol instead of a scraper is the fastest way. I also put it in the water for the windshield AFTER having filled it up with water.
In an Instagram story you guys said you were done with van life. Is this your last van trip?
One couples dream is another couple's nightmare.
Glad y’all are back!! Excited to see what adventures come your way in 2022!!
Hope your pipes were ok. Normally in Canada you would drain the water from the pipes not just turn the water (only preventing new water from entering the lines). The tank would have Antifreeze put in and then run into the lines.
"Vegan cheese only tastes good if you've been vegan for a LONG time and forgotten what cheese tastes like." 😂
Let me politely ask to,shave the beard Nate we liked it for the first 10 mins but I want the  old Nate
Jesus Christ called people everywhere to repent, therefore, if you confess with your lips the Lord Jesus and believe with all your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved and inherit the Kingdom of Heaven and eternal life. told other people how good he is, how he saves, heals and liberates and gives eternal life124
*hangs socks in the driving are*  Kara: Ive never loved you more  Love it 🤣
The ghost of Freddie Mercury thinks that moustache MUST GO.
Love you guys! Think it’s time to get a bigger newer van. Just saying😉🙃😳😁
Awesome! Although I can’t wIt for the surfing because I’m in Canada and it’s usually always -20 here lately.
So excited for your trippp!!!! Excited for the skiing vlogs!!!!! 🙌🥳⛷️
First video I’ve seen of you guys and I love the vibes, the energy and chemistry between them, I love it ❤️
Van project videos  > walking through a state video
Love following you guys. Quick tip for you, boil water in a tea kettle and then put the water in pan.
Did you ever put your undies on the tree kara?😂 I love watching all your adventures but this is a good one for sure! My husband and I want to convert a school bus and do the same, you're a big inspiration!
Finally you guys are back!!!
The amount of time Nate says how proud he is of Kara is just absolutely heartwarming. You guys are adorable it’s ridiculous!
Hi you two! Greetings from Arizona! My hubby and I recently discovered your channel, and we enjoy watching your adventures. Kara, can you tell me the brand of your white ski helmet you wore in this video? I’d like to buy one to wear on my ebike! 🙏
None of us are good, nobody is better than anybody else, we are all sinners who by God’s free gift of salvation by dying on the cross for us, freed us from the pains of hell, and the human fear of death. Come to the LORD Jesus Christ, he will always love you, he will never neglect you. Come to him before it’s too late. ‘’For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life’’ John 3:16. Salvation is not a reward for the good things we have done (it’s not based on our performance) so none of us can boast about it. Ephesians 2:9 It is only through the grace of God are ye saved. So accept God’s Mercy repent for all of your sins, aloud to the Lord Almighty Christ Jesus, cry aloud that Jesus Christ is God, who was crucified and was raised on the third day. forsaking your sins and trusting in the rich blessings of his grace. ‘’for it is by faith that purge’s us from all sin, faith in the living God Christ Jesus’’
Does anyone know what type of camera they use ?? And what type of editing program ?
im kinda digging the stach now
nate looks SO MUCH like Dusty with that stache!
Has anyone tried the greens product they promote? How does it taste?
Props to y’all for promoting Eamon & Bec’s new cookbook; definitely good friends to have. Keep up the great work and safe travels!
Go home stop complaining
Kara and Nate I just adore you guys. I'm a fan. But so sorry, Eamon and Bec's veg recipes are really ewww. They're a cute couple, but clearly they don't cook. Their veg recipes are for people who hate eating.  Bleh.
It might be a myth but I’ve heard it’s against the law for any gas station to deny you air or water. They will put a price on it for you to pay, but if you go inside and just ask them to turn it on for you they will. At least they do in California.
when I saw Eamon and Bec on Vagabondes channel I lost my mind. I've really never been into the youtube thing but all your separate channels, I have been so excited for and y'all some how happen to start collabs together. Kara and Nate- I've always thought the ocean is your next adventure. The sailing community is waiting for you. And there's no one I would rather see go out for it.
These two are the definition of the word poser
I love it and I hope you guys are happy have fun
Kara and Nate, if you are ever looking for a good ski spot in the northwest, Mt hood is absolutely amazing, Skibowl in particular as it has the largest night ski area ⛷
Bro I'm digging that stach Nate so lushious lol .
I love Nate's mustache. He's so confident in it and pulls it off so well... dont shave it!!!!!! Love you guys and you are amazing I love ALL  your videos every single one. 😁
shave it off!!!!!
Yay! Glad your losing the mustache. You are such a handsome young man
Nate looks just like his brother Dusty in that pic.
Your gas cap reminds me of a funny story. I used to own an Isuzu Amigo (in hind sight, should never have sold it) and when we moved from NM to Oregon, we stopped at a gas station in the Columbia River Gorge, got gas and continued on to our new home. Sometime during the week, we realized we no longer had the gas cap. Where in the world did I leave it? The following weekend we were headed to WA state to visit family and stopped at the same gas station. We asked if they found a gas cap and they did. They even said they had tried to flag us down the previous weekend but we didn’t see them. Do you have the little arms on your gas door? Just store the gas cap there every time. Don’t ever set it on the gas pump or you might drive away without your gas cap!
The part with the crocs 😭😂 you guys are so funny and kind I loveeeee it here ❤️
Yay, I'm so glad you guys posted again! I love your guy’s videos!! God bless you too!!
What could go wrong living van life??? Brian Laundrie gave van life a really creepy vibe for most of us. Sad. RIP Gabby.  Bye the way, no one stores Propane inside where they sleep. So unsafe and goes against common sense.  Please move that propane tank to the outside . That is disturbing and we do not need to be reading about another van life couples demise over a propane accident. Or don't. Up to you.
nate you have to shave man
Kara revealing that she got a pair of those knock off crocs too.. I DIED. 😂 I love y’all 🥰❤️
you guys have changed my outlook on life so much i’ve been watching for about a year on and off but recently been watching every video of yours! the first video i ever watched was the one where you climbed to base camp of everest and OMG i was hocked from there on out. I’m a 16 year old New Zealander and i’ve decided i no longer want to live the ‘normal’ persons life i want to travel and do challenging things and that’s all beacuse of you beautiful people. Thank you for the happiness you bring us all and i hope to see you maybe come to New Zealand once Covid is over!
Watching you guys is like the kindest thing I can do with my eyes and soul.   Such AMAZING vibes.   Kara, I'm working on my mental health SOOO bad since I was a kid. 29 now. Still putting along.   And if I can come even close to becoming the wonder that you are, I would be truly fulfilled in life. ❤  And nate, my word. I've never seen a man treat a woman like such a godess, and I've never seen the kind of look Kara has in her eyes given to any man before.   You both are an absolute blessing and thank you for sharing that with us so we know that potential exists.   🤟🤟🤟🤟
An easier way of getting rid of the ice on the inside is to turn the van on pump and the heat through the vents by the windshield a few minutes before you want to drive.
i’ve been having a rough couple days mentally and watching this video just brightened my world a little bit (: thank you for sharing your adventures and your love with us!
Love watching your travels.  More than that I absolutely love and am inspired by your energy.
Not gonna lie but the mustache looks good on nate🤣🤣🤣
Hey Nate I hope you secured that grey water container...don't want it tipping over on those mountain roads! Isn't Eamon inspiring...way to get those projects done!
Welcome to New Mexico. Great porn star stash...lol.
I'm sorry to say but I can't seem to take nate seriously with his new mustache 🤣😂🤣😂
The mustache needs to go Nate. Sorry,  I do love you. It reminds me of the "Three Musketeers" and not sure which one you are. Did I mention I love you?  Pease just shave.
I've been waiting for what seems like a dry spell for you two to post.  This just made my week watching you both.  Yay
you are such a handsome dude Nate, please get never have a 'stache!!!
Can you mix AG1 with chocolate almond milk instead of water
missed you guys!!!
Oh my gosh! I just bought the exact same Walmart crocs for me and my husband-mine are identical to Kara’s. 😆 They are amazing!
I gotta say I have OCD to the point this vlog is hard to get through.  I felt so anxious seeing all the mess.  I kept hitting the 10 seconds to see it clean.
Thank you for shaving!
Watching how you guys act around each other is so much fun. Add that most make me laugh, and I have to say, don't stop posting videos!   I will say, I have been a fan of E&B for year's but glad you guys hung out. Watching people on YouTube that seem authentic is really awesome.   Stop reading comments and get back on the mountain!
Kara…Did you find your furry crocs at WMart? I’m trying to find them online. And thanks you guys for the tip about putting the foam squares on the floor for insulation!👍🏻 We’re gonna do that.
The skiing looked fabulous! It’s your face you do you! I need to order the cookbook!
New Mexico!!  The land of enchantment, and my home state!!  SO great to see you there😊❤️
Thank god you’re shaving the ‘Stache. It gives too much of an 80’s porn star vibe
Bots are ruining YouTube comments.  So annoying.
noooooooo why did oyu publicize ioverlanderrrrrrrr.... cardinal sin Nate!
https://youtu.be/vWlvBM9Oe7M
keep the stache
I think bear is more suited you than a moustache
@Nate you got 50,000 likes on last video let's shave the stash.
New game, tequila shot every time Kara mentions Eamon & Bec. 🤣 Love their vlogs as much as yours, I was dying laugh again at the chewing gum as much as you both were! PS: Good thing the drinking game starts next week otherwise I’d still be drunk next vlog! Hahaha
NOOOOOOOO!!! DONT SHAVE IT!!!!!
Just a heads up, if you have to scrape ice off the inside of your van, you probably have a water leak somewhere.
We created a YouTube account just to like that video so you will shave!
You should attach a servo motor to the shower water valve which runs to a remote/switch so you don't have to constantly open it up
Hey Kara and Nate, Come up to Central Minnesota where we have -20 degrees Fahrenheit this week 😂😂
What about showers ?
Kara bringing freestyle Fridays even if Eamon won't.
Come to canada
Yes! Sayonara, mustachio! 🥸🤣  Sorry Kara. 🙁
Omg Charlie!!!! I've missed him!  Oi... shudder flashback to the scary border crossing!
Love every one of your videos✌💜
So dose that mean that thing above ur lip is going bye bye!! Lol
So are you shaving it off now lol?
Best vids ever!! I have never been skiing or anywhere in the mountains :( dream someday
I miss Charlie!  I was wondering if you still kept in touch.  Yay!
What was the music you used for the skiing part of your video ???
Another amazing video. Love what y’all do
Lets go i love the van life videos!
can you put antifreeze in the grey water tank?
Noooooo! Don’t shave the mo 😭 they just liked the previous video because of the content not the moustache 😂😭
Seeing that ski lodge bring back so many great memories. I’m from Oklahoma and love going there to ski and always have fun we usually stay in red river the trails are really good to ride Polaris through and then when it’s to warm to ski we bike the trails and zip line in Taos or angle fire. Love y’all’s videos.
Love this content!!! Also love how you publicized eamon and bec that was so nice of you
Wait Nate still has the mustache why!?!
I was just thinking about Charlie the other day and hoping you guys were still friends :)
Much love from an Amarillo fan❤️
I love how much ya'll love Eamon and Bec!  That's how I found ya'lls channel and I can't decide who I like more now!  :)
Amazing video!  So excited to watch your winter van life ski adventures ⛷🥰  These skiing trips are my ideal van life along with bringing my bikes for some rails / trails cycling :)
Last year I binge watched yu guys constantly every vid I watched the best one was easily the one that was in the cave or the Antarctica blog they the best imo but thank yu guys
I was wondering what is the shower situation like for this skiing trip?
Ok the moustache may be growing on me…
Not sure if I will get used to the porn stash.
I do believe the viewers got it right: 80s porn stache it's time to go, lol.
At first glance at the thumbnail I thought that was Craig and it was a Kinging It video with the hat and hoodie. Glad you will be shaving the mustache soon!
Just remember that it takes longer to boil things in higher elevations so that's why it took more than 20 minutes. Looked like you two had a great time. Looking forward to more of your adventures!
Okay, I did that comment to help you guys...I have a channel that I am learning about how important interactions are...but that does not mean I am meaning to lean on you guys to get there - we got this!!  We have watched ALMOST EVERY VIDEO!! AND I JUST BOUGHT INTO EPEDIMEC MUSIC.  Oh you guys are my HOPE!!!
The Wednesday videos keep throwing me off in the best way possible! Love watching all your fun adventures and new challenges!
Nate's mustache: "Hello...my name is Inigo Montoya....you killed my father...prepare to die." Kara's libido: Nope..."it's Rugged." @11:29
I LOOOVE the interaction between you two guys, you treat each other with so much love and kindness. Is really fun to watch your videos. 💕 SUBSCRIBED! 😁
We have the same water container :)
Call me a murderer all you like, I will never renounce my meat-eating ways even when I'm dead.
When In baja definityl stop in San Juanico. I'll be surfing there mi February.
That most certainly was not a ski jacket
I think a goatee would suit him better instead of just the mustache or maybe the mustache and goatee together 🤔
Your channel is the only channel on youtube on which I don't get bored after watching a 30min video After the video ended I thought "that's it" Love you guys  And  Nate pls don't get rid of that moustache It looks good on you 🥰
Are you guys going to come to Utah? If so, then I'd LOVE to go skiing with you guys!
Nate looks so much older  with a mustache
That stove burner flame is so close to the fabric window cover!😬
White people are amazing
“It’s a crop top” may be my favorite Nate line yet
Hi guys I’m going to YouTube and I really love your videos like that I was in my search
Hey look it shows Odessa on the map               Aka were I live
Get that mustache off😀😀 but he making videos
Last 5-7 videos have been realy boring for me :(
I love watching your videos! You guys seem like such lovely people, so genuine and kind. You guys definitely deserve this trip. ❤
Love seeing you guys back in the van!!
Hello, my question is will you guys be taking a shower elsewhere and did you guys think about putting the 🎿 on top of the van in like some sort of holder or something? I was just wondering. Love your channel.
I LOVE 😍 long videos!!
Nate talking about how cool it is to wake up in new places and it still feel the same while Kara is barely awake is just so them and I love it 🥰
Hey Kara, what does Athletic Greens taste like? I love the idea of getting all my nutrients, but I,m very picky about how things taste.
Super hype for the upcoming content 😃
That moustache looks lovely on you.
Have y’all ever tried a ranger roll before? Might help packing your clothes in a small space.
Do not shave!!!!
Ya. I mustache you, no.
Skied Taos over the new year! Let us know when you’re in COS! If you hit crested butte I have fab food suggestions as well as Buena vista, Breckinridge, etc….!
Honestly, you guys r great…. But… I do love your European travel, first class and always how excited u were to visit the lounges.. watching life in the van reminds me of my every day hum drum life…… all the challenges.. sigh.. looking forward to heading back to The Lounges with you…:)
That night sky in Taos was amazing!! Glad you're back in the van!! Have fun!!
Nate looks a little like Dick Dastardly with the mustache 🤣Love it!
Now at #10!!!! It’s a parrrrrttyyy 🤩🥳💗 thank you for making the best, most wholesome videos ever and inspiring us to take our own trip to explore the world and capture it!!! Can’t wait to see more of the adventure you and Nate go on and of course more videos!!! ⛷🎿☃️
Omg I live in Amarillo!!!!!!! Wish I knew you were here, I would have loved to meet you guys
1. PLEASE DONT SHAVE IT 2. I want a love like Kara and Nate have 🥺 3. All of your videos never fail to put a smile on my face
I miss the coffee cup openings.
You guys should come and ski at Ski Santa Fe here in New Mexico.
Loved this video!  It felt like it was so haphazard and made you seem vulnerable and relatable! Love you guys!! Thank you! 😘 (You look so cute in your new jacket, Kara! I love the style!)
Nate looks so much like the actor Jeffrey Donovan he’s not the most famous but I see him in some things and he looks exactly like you
Watching Nate take on an Eamon project was amazing! Great job! I loved how Kara was like "who's idea was it?" Then was like **flashback to my great idea.**
I love REI I’m a Boy Scout so that’s why
Fyi...you can usually rent ski jackets and pants/bibs
Isn’t there a spot on the gas tank door for the cap? You kind of slide it in?
so I'm wondering if you are like Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis- anti-bathing/showering? Doesn't seem like you mind going for a long time without and looks like you have no plans now that the shower is out of commission...
All of a sudden I'm a huge Van Morrison fan.
Nate is  scarping ice
I just love you guys and how real you are about the cool stuff and daily life! You inspire me to want to be adventurous in life and not to let it pass me by! Thank you for always being a light in the world, I’d watch anything you guys post! ❤️
I laughed so hard at the REI trip…. Literally every time I go in there 😂😂😂😂
Nate: find a small magnet and glue it to your gas cap!! You’re welcome ☺️
Bit more work on that moustache Nate and you guys might end up pregnant!
Don't you dare shave that stache!! Looks like an epic start to ski season. You *almost* made me want to winterize my van and hit the slopes. Except that desert heat is so so nice!!
Crocs turn in your man card
I ❤ the love fest between and Eamon & Bec. Two of my favourites.
The reason why your chili took forever to boil was because you’re up in altitude. You are going to need more energy (heat) than normal to make something boil. So that’s why it doubled your cooking time.
Shave your beard nate
Sorry, Nate - that plumbing solution was TOTALLY Kara's idea. 💯💯💯 Also, I am HERE for Hipster Ski Bum Vegan Kara and Nate™!! This was AWESOME! I feel like you guys are living my thirty-something dreams (from back in the day) and I endorse your wise decisions. ❤
Has he had her nose pierced the whole time I have watched them? I have just noticed it. I love it.
Did you consider a roof rack?
So much fun!!
Nate: That mustache looks creepy dude. 😬
You’re kidding us with the stash right
Shave the stache please! Also, get Kara some hot hands.
Me living in MN and they are like -6!
You guys make me so happy, i make me so happy to see! I love how your videos show the world to people that may not get to see it otherwise! :)
OK IM SO HAPPY TO HEAR ABOUT CHARLIE AGAIN!
I will say I miss the bloops at the end of every video
I just  remember the old Nate with out a mustache and it always shocks me every time I watch a video and I am like What who is that and then  in see that it is just Nate but I could never dream of these amazing people quit making videos. I have been here since the  capsule hotel in japan i think and the mattress was like an inch thick and the pillows were made out of beans. I wish they could come visit me sometime they are not busy with travel. Love you Kara and Nate!!!
Dang I wish I knew you were here! I’m in Santa Fe, but where you slept was very close to me!
I have the same Bucket List book! Such a cool book.
Dang I wish I knew you were here!,,, I live in NM, close to where you were!
50,000 likes, doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with the mustache, we all just like the show. Instead do 50,000 comments about the mustache, it actually looks really good on you.
Im already stressed for you guys
I probably the only hood dude that watches you guys 💯❤️😂
Charlie!!! I bet he’s the reason you’re trending. 😉
“Vegan cheese only tastes good if you’ve been a vegan for a long time and you've forgotten what cheese tastes like” 😂😂😂  Some of them are kind of funky... I have tried several non-dairy cheeses, I prefer cashew cheese the best!
Did you go to Loveland ski area
Roof rack for the skis?
Nate, Kara's cooking at the end was slowed by the altitude, takes longer for water to boil there don't you know?! lol !   But seriously, who cares, as long as it tastes good.  Better yet, what a way to end a terrific day.  Thanks for the video you two.
I remember when I used to go skiing in Mammoth, and the slopes were so crowded! I was constantly dodging people and worried about being run over by hotshot snowboarders. I can't believe how wide open the slopes are in your video. And such a beautiful area. I hope there's snow waiting for us in Yosemite Valley in 2 weeks. We're renting a campervan to get there, thanks to being inspired by you and others.
What is the ski area you went to
So we have a toy hauler and we buy at the dollar store these.The Home Store Moisture Eliminators, 8.1 oz. Containers.they help get rid of waking up to the ice on the inside. Happy safe travels hope this can help.
We call those shoes Croccasins in Australia as they're mix of Crocs and Moccasins!
This was a triple-like!
Why was Kara cracking me up that whole video 😂😂 can’t wait for this big adventure!
Nate and Kara were brave to sleep there! From a fellow New Mexican
I’m so glad y’all are back on skis! It warms my heart knowing that you both will become ski bums. Have been waiting for more ski videos since the treehouse last year! ❤️
Love the skiing guys! Glad to see you back in the van for a bit. Thank you for sharing your dreams!❤️👏👍😉
Thanks for sharing your adventures with us!
Hey! Great mods. :) One question, where does the shower drain? Ya mentioned the skis drip drying in the shower. Doesn't it drain to possible freezing grey tank?
The ‘tree of lust.’ Ski racers make those!!
lol kara does not approve of no mustache! give her a beard instead hahaha
The mustache makes you resemble your brother more.
we NEED:cKara and Nate X Sailing La Vagabonde X Eamon & Beck
His mustache cracks me up!!!!!
Watching this video when it’s trending at 10
I'm in central Canada, if it was -10 here in the winter, everyone is happy because it's so nice out! Today was -30, that's an average day.
Wish I had known you were in Amarillo. I would have been there with my tool belt on to help!
I liked your travels in other countries better.
Keep th moustache, the likes will be under 1k cuz you rock the moustache
Nate’s mustache is giving Robbie Rotten vibes
Good vlog! Yes please shave your mustachio
Thank god the “likes” won!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Can’t wait to see you shave it off!
IM SOOOO HAPPY YALL ARE IN THE VAN AGAIN!!!!!  I Love watching your adventures.
🤍🤍🤍🤍
Taking a break from going in order BUT just finished the video where Nate first showed a stache back in 2019 from your guys Mexican workation! Looked good at 30 and still looks good today!!
Are you going to buy your own ski’s or continue to rent?
I Love the Mustache! Love it! Love it! Love it!🎈
if you guys want to get frost of the windshield quicker/easier use a ziplock with warm water and drag it along the wind shield.
Please shave that silly mustache!!!
Oh dear gawd please lose that awful mustache. Gross.
What is with mustache Nate last I check you didn’t have one 🧐😂😮
Just to prevent a possible disaster I recommend duck taping or securing the blue bucket to the funnel
Finally!!! New upload 😍
You guys should drive from the farthest northern point in the US Prudhoe Bay Alaska to the cape of Punta Mariato in Panama.
That panini looked damn good
Yea Nate please shave that moosttachhheee lol 😂I feel like that’s what it would want to be called haha 😂 now if you wanna try and grow a beard thst would be cool lol beards are cool 🧔‍♂️ 🧔‍♂️
Charlie!! I've missed y'all's travel buddy!
Love seeing you two just follow your hearts and have fun! Thanks for taking us along!
“It’s like rugged” (cool voice) - Kara  😂
I live in New Mexico Los lunas
WTH😳is Dat strip of mold under Nate's nose🤣
Nate looks like Dusty with the porn stache!
Go Kara! Go Kara! Lol! Just kidding, Nate! You guys rock! Have fun skiing!
I love watching y'all, but who else thinks the mustache makes Nate look like a 70's porn star? Y'all are so stinkin' cute! We're going skiing in Colorado at Wolf Creek. It would be so cool to see y'all there.
That back burners’ proximity to the window covering is giving me major anxiety.
Thought you was shaving that off !
Loved your colourful Buddhist prayer flag in your van.
Your guys channel is so fun and entertaining! You make everyone happy !keep on doing what your doing ur great!
Kara "oh i can wear my tie die hoodie!" Nate "its a crop top" The diction in his voice made that so funny.  Skiing looked like so much fun. Go Kara!  Your relationship is beautiful.  Noooo. I love the mustache.
Man I just started getting used to the stash  lol
They make adhesive heat pads for the gray water tank. 12 V, low current. Keeps your tanks from freezing.  I have them, work great.
You guys inspire me so much and you make me laugh and I went to a place to a place you have been in a video
I would like to thank kara for converting the temperature from fahrenheit to celsius!
For the vlog... Try snowboarding!!!!
Quick question have you ever gotten kicked out of a parking lot with your van?
#relationshipgoals
I just love watching y’all! Great job skiing!! Hugs from NC 🤗💜✌🏻
Make sure to keep your shoulders pointed down the hill :D
Please hold Nate down and shave that thing... it's distracting
Amarillo has a pretty nice Walmart to crash at! It’s pleasant after staying near Denver and having the all night drug dealer lurking the lot.
Actually some Crocs do have fluffy stuff in the inside
Please tell me Charlie is going to make a special appearance this year! Your old vlogs with him are some of my favorite!
your a good man nate that plastic rubber you bought really does make it look like it's been part of the van for yrs that's very cool plus no more cold feet when walking around in the van or bathroom yay go nate go but then my fav part at the 4:45 mark kara goes: THESE are all of nates clothes yes im that guy who has dated a girl in many yrs but you sound annoyed, what's that? you'd love to visit me in ca and give me nate's shirts? ok if he wears xl then i'll take em btw yes i saw that emamon and bec video too iv'e dated girls like bec she'd totally kill me if i was talking like that with gum (most women really hate that not sure if that bothers you kara) but that's why i don't chew gum around women i do that here at home before i go out oh and yes i almost forgot...kara: omg what? nate? yea look underwear and bras on the way up kara: wow i didn't see that before nate: ikr i said the same thing too im like omg what the, that kinda reminds me of friend and fellow travler who has a channel on here the one and only justinscarred one of the first trips he did was check out old route 66 where i think in az is where they have those cars stuck to the ground and people tag them all over one day i need to go there and spray paint my name i'll have it say: matt alvarez was here that would be cool   p.s. me thinks nate should watch more emamon videos on how to make the van look cool i think he said they built that ladder to go on the roof themself i think you can do it nate hell recently youtuber camper van kevin installed and made holes to make a ladder so he could go up and down his rv plus he added solor panels on the rv roof and even painted it a new color all without even knowing what he was doing that's right half us guys think we know what were doing but then what's in our head comes out better than expected it's like oh, i did that? i like it then others will also say what a good job you did !!
ITS TRENDING #9 ON YOUTUBE RIGHT NOWWW IM SO HAPPY FOR YOU GUYS!!!!
Are you guys ok?
Hello Kara and Nate, Im an Occupational Therapy Intern in the Philippines and can I just say your videos are one of the things that help me get through this pandemic. Wishing you all the best!!!   PS. Hopefully next time when you visit the Philippines you will have a better experience 😢
Y'all should watch Mav but to me  living in Wisconsin -25isn't anything special.
You guys are awsome!
Nates encouragement while skiing, so sweet!
I love you  guys!!!!  I found your channel a year or so ago and fell in love. I have never really traveled much in my life, I mean I have never seen the ocean and have only been on a plane twice, so love seeing all the different places and cultures and foods!!!!  I lost my husband 5 years ago the day after Christmas to cancer.  I love watching you guys and seeing how much you love each other, respect each other and utter confidence in each other!!  Keep up the amazing videos and I hope that when you make it to West Virginia that you are somewhere near me so  maybe I can say hi!!  Love ya'll
I see Kara got her way and the mustache is back! Im curious to see what all us viewers think though 🤔?  Team mustache, or baby face Nate?? Comment below!
Hi I love your videos but can you put Eamon in them less? He really creeps my family and I out!!
Nate, Yesssss shave 🪒 that snot-catcher 😁😁😁 tell me I’m wrong!!! Especially ⛷ 😁😁😂
Looks like Nate got all that work done on the van so you are comfortable in that bone-chilling weather.  Glad you enjoyed you skiing trip and oh it seemed like it was not terribly expensive.  Good job both of you!
Can't wait to see more adventures with Charlie 😊.
Nate with a moustache is really unique
Wish I would've known you guys were in Amarillo. I would've suggested some amazing places to eat. Also, I love Taos. Red River is another gem that's not to far from Taos.
This makes me want to learn how to ski. Looks so fun!
So they are called groomers. The machines that clean the ski slopes. We call them snow cats in Utah:) You two are awesome!! Again if your in the area I can try to hook you up:)
Charlie!!!! He’s not forgotten! Some of my favorite K&N vlogs were with Charlie.  Are y’all doing any other travel adventures with him?  Can’t wait to see more of your Mexico trip!
From Amarillo
Hello from Canada 🇨🇦 😍😊 Lucky ducks! Sleeping at a casino 😆 #winners  good Job at skiing ⛷ 👏 👍  love you both!! Now let's head to the beach! Brrr hahhaa
Dude....the stache!!  🤣🤣
I’m so glad you were using Eamon & Bec’s recipes look so good.Nate was really liken your mustache,please don’t shave it it makes you look so good.
did u guys see the milky way
A nerdy fact on Kara's defense, well sort of!... Due to lower atmospheric pressure at higher altitudes the boiling point of water is lowered and as a consequence cooking time is increased, therefore it will take longer for your food to fully cook... Though... it should have increased only by a few minutes... not an hour... LOL...
Just go with it! Whatever seems fun..... Life is too short‼️
I know you all are tight on space, but what about getting one of those 6 in 1 appliances?  They are: air fryers, slow cookers, roaster, indoor grill, bake, steamer, simmer and saute' all in one. You won't have to contend with the propane and have to worry about running out of propane or finding a place to get your tank filled.  Just a thought.....I've ran out of propane many a times in the middle of a meal...usually late at night where I couldn't get it refilled.  Amazon has these for about $200 with all the bells and whistles.
If you need to learn to Ski you need look no further than South Park- make sure you dont *Pizza* when you should *French Fry*  or you're gonna have a bad time..
Hey! Where are the Bloops????!
If you are doing what you want , there is nothing wrong with that. No regrets.
❤️❤️❤️All I could think of through this whole video is that Nate is a 70’s porn star🤣🤣🤣 I think a goatee could be a better option 😉😘
So Happy to see you both back in the van and enjoying all the creature comforts you had installed last year finally. Look forward to your next video always -Justin
Its so hard to watch these because I used to live in a rv and travel the country, Toas was my favorite. I miss it sooooo Much :))
Yay! I'm so glad it got enough likes to shave your mustache. Hey, did that problem with your tire get fixed? The one where Kara had tire pressure issues driving by herself.
Wished y’all could explore Amarillo Tx more that’s where I’m from
White people. 🤦🏾‍♀️🤦🏾‍♀️🙄
It looks like you guys will be driving through the Inland Empire as you go to San Diego — there’s some really cool outdoors stuff to do around here including hang gliding :) also beautiful wineries in Temecula to park the van at!!!
I can where my tie dye hoodie! It’s a crop-top. 😂 Kara and Nate 2022
I couldn't finish before commenting.....Shave the stash.  Ok, I feel better.
Hey there Kara and Nate I recommend Steamboat Springs as a amazing ski place. I live in Steamboat springs and I think you guys would have a blast up here. I love your channel.
hello kn, this video came in and nate showed her love for ski and board so that is 3 boards for only two feet - and kara loving the stupid SUV of the folks van is too funny.   kara keeps showing how he has to fix this or that of the now federal express vans all over the leftover americans crisis of driving a you know what van.  elle for over the hill pretzel with mustard couple
In Kara's defence, altitude effects the boiling point/temperature and efficiency of your gas burners. As you guys know, higher altitude equals less oxygen, which  equals longer cooking time. Although I love all of your adventures/videos, it's good to see you guys back in the van.
I miss Charlie. He needs to make an appearance again.   Also, there’s so much happening in this vlog, I keep commenting and there’s so much of the video left.
Looove the mustache! :) Don't shave it! lol :P
Add fixing your gas cap to the list! I feel like I'd lose that too LOL  so happy to see ya'll back traveling in the van!!!
I went to Taos once and it is the best! The place is so fun and amazing! I hope y’all had fun!
1) this video has me excited about my upcoming ski trip at Snowbird! My favorite and I’ve been to many. Maybe I’ll run into you guys - we shall see! 2) REI empties my wallet too but more so on the camping gear. 3) Will you attempt snowboarding? 🏂 Once I got into that a decade ago I never went back to skis. 🎿  4) Your window covering right at the cooktop makes me nervous, lol.
Kara's hair is so long!!!!
I’ve been silent about this but I can’t do it anymore…. With the moustache, Nate looks like an 80s porn star!  🥸 sorry!  I just can’t be silent anymore!  Lol. Please, please, bring back cool Nate! 😎
PLS DONT SHAVE
We love the stash Nate! Don’t shave it!!
Absolutely loved this and the real life nature of everything!  Thank you for sharing your life and talent with us :)
Have  you guys been to Michigan?
I feel like having a steak with a side of fried chicken after watching this.
What is your last name
Kara, please let Nate shave the mustache!
Really need to thank you Nate for sharing your Skin Cancer story,as my husband has had a sore between hair line and ear for 2 yrs and we got him into the doctors on Monday and by Wednesday today he has an appointment to have it removed and hopefully also one on his arm next Wednesday ( so that's a total of 9 days and from appointment to having the skin cancer beginning cut out). Thank you soooo much for sharing once again and hopefully it has helped many more people. Sending much ❤ 😍 love ❤ 😍 💖
Have a fun trip!
Best line “I agree with you Eamon”. 😂😂😂
great video guys!!
Is it bad I was mostly looking forward to nate saying he is going to shave his stach. Good video still, but the next one will be one of the most viewed for the mustache shaving
Your messiness gives me anxiety
I hope you guys have tire chains
The stache looks creepy  I love your content anyways lol
You guys should ski at either Snowbird or Alta when you are in Utah!! Those are the best resorts! And you can buy an AltaBird pass where you can ski at both resorts because they have a connection!
I love that you still talk to Charlie, I miss him in the vlogs!
I think you looked better with a full 5 O'clock shadow grown a bit
9:07- I’m sure you planned for that storage area to fit a suitcase, but can we talk about how pleasing that was to watch it just slip right in and out of sight.
lol Tortilla soup with a HINT of spatula~!!!!!!
Such an awesome, sweet, and wholesome video. You guys look so happy & I’m glad you guys had a good time.
❤️
So vegan cheeses taste so much better than they did 20 years ago when I found out I was allergic to dairy protein, so no more regular cheese for me ever again
I live watching your videos. I am glad you both are back on youtube.
This is making me want to go skiing agin SOOO bad! I have a trip plans for this spring but till then watching your videos is awsome!!!
I thought Nate’s mustache was fake lol
Oh my gosh. I’m cold now lol this is why I’m waiting to move in my van after winter haha I’m so excited but I gotta get used to life in the van  before I get used to winter😂
Those crocks are so funny because I was at Walmart the other day and my niece bought  those same ones. I kinda talked her into it. lol
OK I think the mustache is working for you...
Wonderful video,  I love how the floor turned out .....great ski mountain time....keep warm ....🇨🇦
You should have had your Grandpa to help you.  Awesome man btw.
As usual, loved the video!
Weird I was just talking about Ramon noodles and how I really don't think they are good for you to eat. Well now i don't know
Something to consider is that you’re cooking altitude. It’s going to take longer
I have to say I am not a Vegan but Eamon and Bec and also Isabel Paige's cooking so make it look like i could do it with no problem!! Both of them are amazing at cooking plant based food that makes me so want to eat it everyday and not the caca i eat now!! Also your channel got me to get athletic greens samples, but I still have not tried it yet!!! I am so bad at drinking something green! I feel like Dr. Seuss lol
Lets write it on the list and cross it off. Does kara know me? Lol
You guys are my favorite YouTubers ever love watching your videos
I am glad you ended the show with, I am going to shave :) You guys are fun to watch.
OMG I so loved that clip you stuck in there of Eamon and Bec!!!!! That was so funny how she did that tp him with his gum!!!
I am so pumped to watch y'all on these new adventures! The energy that comes through your vlogs is contagious. 😁
You should try to ski in Ogden Valley at Snowbasin or Powder Mountain.
Amarillo... approaching the town from the west on I-40, it smells like what I imagined the trash compactor on the Death Star smelled like.
I'm so happy I got to see you clean and travel I love your channel so much and from what I see your relationship is so close and cute. :)
I'm so excited to see you in winter van mode!
I love these van admin videos, it really speaks to your talent as creators that just watching you organise and solve these problems is still absolutely charming and entertaining. It reminds me of Casey Neistat's videos, he did a lot of crazy stuff, but watching him do "everything else" us ordinary humans also had to deal with was still great to watch. You guys are amazing storytellers <3
Well shoot!  Missed a chance to meet you.  Thats my Lowe's!    We live in the neighborhood behind it and I'm there ALl the time.  Next pass through, give us a shout!
Fuzzy lined Walmart Crocks are the best!  We live on a 45 ft Catamaran.  Last November we were in Deale Maryland, they were the best purchase when the temperature dropped.
I’ve been so excited for this video. It’s so much fun watching you guys. Thanks for brightening my day while I’m in isolation with covid, alone. ❤️‍🩹
Van life would not be for me because I need a shower atleast twice a day but I love watching you guys !!!!! It's very interesting and you guys are funny asf. I wish I could travel around the world like yall, maybe one day!! Xoxo
Nate either needs to go full beard or keep it clean.
All I am seeing the stash  🤣
Bec treated him like a six year old, but Eamon spent the last three episodes acting like a 10 year old. Not fair!
OMG please can we have Charlie back in the vlog? It has been way too long since he made an appearance.
darn you were closer in dallas lol
Noooo. Keep it. Kara quick hide all the shVing equipment. Lol
Your so close to Houston please come here!!!!! I wanna meet you two so bad!!!
I bet Dusty is wishing you had that padded floor when he was sleeping on it!! Lol
Yes I was so bored and then your video popped up!!!!
Disappointed to see that you have to wear a mask in the beautiful western part of the country. Mass formation psychosis, look it up. It’s a thing. Check out Joe Rogan‘s podcast with Dr. Malone. We’ll all be worried about viruses that have been around for thousands of years and we’ll all be wearing a mask forever unless we realize that we have been conned about this pandemic. 😔
Love you guys to bits, buuuut please get rid of the stach.  Reminds me of Porn stach from Orange is the new black.  Sorry, not sorry
I bet these folks started off living in a van, got a huge fan base,and now lives in a mansion.Everytime they film a new video they just take a van out .
Not a fan of the mustache Nate,  sorry.
I want a relationship like yalls
Charlie!!! Always fun when he is in the vlog.  Now I've really got itchy feet to go skiing! (But no sports rn because of mono, so I'll just keep watching you two ski 🙂)
Shave the bigote 🤩😊
This is so satisfying and I am glad Nate is not messing around too much with the electricals lol
Please, Come to Fredericksburg, TX.
I’m #TeamKara don’t shave the mustache  Bonus-she loves it on you!!
Never a dull moment
The mountain looks so beautiful, hope you had a great time skiing! I love your videos so much 💕
Ok.......The Mo....has to go  !!......Hope you're in Breck for Ullrfest.....and.....time to invest in a lockable roof rack  !!!
Great video!
No keep the moustache,  it's nice!
I’m laying in my 1994 Ford E3 50 watching this. But I’m in Key West so I’m really warm
You guys are so cute together ❤️
Aside from keeping up with the current videos, I am binging your past videos from the beginning. I’ve watched your guys’ videos on and off since 2018 and I started watching every new video since a few months after you started van life. I’m currently on your amazon videos and it’s crazy to see how far this channel has come since the beginning. Thank you so much for sharing your passion and I hope you guys never stop!
Kara and Nate you should go to space in the future!! that’s a one place u haven’t visit yettt, love you guys sm ♥️🪐👽🛸🛰🚀👩‍🚀🧑‍🚀
I just you know how lucky you are
NO SHAVE!! The moustaches is amazing
When it gets to summer time y'all should try to make a trip down to Corpus Christi Texas and visit the beaches and national seashore. I would love to see that on your videos. P.S. I love y'all's video. one my partner and I will be on the road like y'all.
Love nate moustache Memories of van life
You should have a seperate ball valve to shut off the hot water.  You only showed cutting off the cold water and did not appear to test the hot water in the shower to see if it was still flowing.  All that said, if you keep the van heater on above 40 or 45 farenheit you should be OK if all your pipes are inside the van.
I think you 2 are the best. And the love you show and the commitment  to each other is rare in this time of life is  one of the best  things. You far out do any of the others in this field.
Outlet shopping come on...
Upgrade needed...https://youtu.be/HtRrlsQ-JRE
Love that you guys are hitting the slopes, I grew up skiing, and my dad and I used to play a game every time we went. We would look at which number our chair was on the lift that day, and then try to beat our chair back down the mountain. He passed in 2005, and I haven’t played the game since. Hope you guys can pick up the tradition.
You should make a Van life daily life lists book.
I love Taos! My family has a cabin about 2 miles from the Ski Valley. I've spent so much time skiing/snowboarding on that mountain, im so glad y'all got to enjoy it!
Literally Nate suits that mustache Soo much 😂.  I love it
I’m curious, do you keep a jug of spare DEF in case you’re low and the gas station you’re fueling up at doesn’t carry it?
I can’t wait to retire and live in our camper.
No shaving
Y’all should try snowboarding during this road trip. That would make a good video
Let me just say I think that about 78% of us do not like Nates mustache
So glad Nate is going to shave his moustache. Every time I saw him on screen- I’m like….who’s that?  He just looks so odd with it. 😂  One thing I would say about your grey water tank- as there’s no tight seal, it’s going to stink a bit. Especially if the waste water is left too long, as it’s exposed.
Don’t forget about the propane leakage! I believe when the box was installed he also put a leak valve on the bottom so if any fumes did escape the propane bottle, it would go out the bottom of the van!! Just a thought!!
My Siri was activated when Nate said “Hey siri …” 😂😂😂
Dude. Love the stash!
Never call your last run!! Take two, and skip the last
Don't knock casino docking, it comes with security patrols. My wife and I feel safer at casinos and Cracker Barrels than we do at WalMart. Bonus: CB and most casinos offer hot breakfast and coffee at good prices. We've had the same conversation about how no matter where we're parked, we wake up looking at the same four walls.
If you’re heading into freezing cold conditions, buy a can of Silicone Spray and spray it around all your rubber window seals, so you can roll down your windows, and open your back doors. Also buy a can of de icer spray for your gas cap flap. I leave in Northern Maine, and these are things that are super helpful. Also, a bag of cat litter just incase you get stuck someplace. Helps with tire traction.
all of this work is worth it for the INSANELY amazing trip you both are going on 😍
Howdy🤠
Such a sweet couple.
When did Kara get a nose ring? No not attractive. And Nate should not have facial hair either.
Great vid! Love the classic VLOG style.
Label the hoses for future uses...
1 word === Shave
are you guys doing ragbri 2022?
oh jeez still the cheesy mustache? Some serious pornstache dude vibes!
Omg I miss Charlie!!! So happy you guys are still in touch all these years later 💛 I love international friendships like that 🥰
Is your diesel heater working now?
the muststash you have is great
Great video guys
Love the stache 🤩🤩.
Shave that moustache
Yay, no more mustache (sorry, Kara... :)
Why not just let grey water drain to ground? Or put gutter deicer cable or fish pond heater in grey tank underneath van. Tank inside van takes away from storage
So so so excited for the next few weeks of videos and all these ski adventures!!! I hope you guys stop at all the national parks in Utah too!!
So happy you still talk with Charlie , hope you guys meet up soon, he’s so funny in your old videos
accidentally shave the mustache nate- like your razor just "slips" and oops-- it's gone!!!!
next project:  tear out the shower to expand kitchen!!
Those mats  you used for the same that I used for my gym
I'm getting use to the mustache. It grows on every vídeo
-20 in Minnesota and I'm sleeping on a frozen lake
That stash...i was watching IT while you were talking 😂..good times!..love all your vlogs! Keep being amazing!
This is the earliest I have ever been I love u Kara and Nate! ❤️❤️ ( 7 hours!)
HIGHLY RECOMMEND a night or two at The Ritz Carlton, Bachelor Gulch in Colorado, ski in ski out resort, with spa, steaming pools and hot tubs and unbeatable service!
let’s just appreciate Nate’s mustache. He may think he don’t look good in it, but it makes him look very stylish and i love it
Arnt you bringing Nate’s dad?
How about a roof rack for your skis and then your surfboard?
Did I miss the heater install?!?
Kara was your sweat suit from vouri
There was no one on the slope.  WOW.  Good for you!
Pex can freeze and thaw, but the brass shower valve cannot. Plumbing for the shower is in the conditioned space, it's just a likely for the sink to freeze as the shower.
The mustache has grown on me. I’m changing my vote to keep it 🤣
LMAO your asking Siri for the weather set off my Siri too :D
Nate you are wearing your 29029 sweatshirt
Jesus loves you he died on the cross for your sins. All you have to do is believe in him and you will be saved. ❤ ✝️
That Mustache is horrifying
Props to Nate for rocking the porn 'stache.
Great ending.  Na na na na.  Na na na na.   hey hey hey goodbye 👋🏻 mustache
Awww, I miss Charlie from Australia! ❤️
I am about to go on a ski trip with my school
The mustache has to go!
I’m loving the video but the mustache has to go
Hahahha yay for you two! Got get it!
Sorry, if the wind make the weather colder ❄️🌬️ in Amarillo. The wind is always a challenge. Howdy from A-town, my home town !!. #howdy #amarillo #wind
No more bloops? 😕
So happy to hear you still talk to Charlie!
Glad to see you are trying a Vegan diet in Jan.  I have been Vegan for 4 years and have never felt better,  not to mention having compassion for our animals and the climate implications.  Cheers to you both.
On this trip will you be visiting Park City and if so when?
Random but helpful tip  In stead of scraping on the ice on the inside of the van turn on all of the fans and face them towards the windows and it will melt them in minutes. You can also get a bag with hot water and put in on the window. Just a helpful tip from a Canadian :)
Go figure, yall actually live around 4 hours north of me! Wouldn't mind meeting up with y'all in the near future (even though you came to my town recently for your Buc-ee's video)...
Charleeeee I missed that man. Especially in Poland vlog I guess with the bikes (or scooter I’m old I can’t remember). Bring him back into the vlog.
That casino has the attitude that built Walmart: Customers are good for business & anyone (other than a bum, er, 'homeless' person, can be a customer. Don't drive anyone (except bums, er, homeless persons) away. Loss of that ethic is killing Walmart. They let bums in and drive mobility fans away. Smart? Not to this mind!
Did ya'll enjoy the smell leaving west out of Amarillo?  lol
Kara has the cutest essence to her ! I aspire to be as cute as she is
Yuck...LOSE the 'STASH
so much respect and love for all the work that went into this video! i can only imagine how much cutting and editing it took to get it to 30 mins. Love you guys!
So happy that you're gonna shave it. I didn't recognize your image for the video when I first saw it... I was like, "Who is that D-bag?" Only to get really excited upon realizing it's Nate.
Hey Guys- you'll need a u-bend in the grey water outlet and seal around the bucket, otherwise smells from the grey water will start seeping into the van (and up through the sink hole)- food waste and water = smelly van! Or if you cant fit a u-bend- make sure the outlet is sealed into the bucket opening and then have a plug in the sink hole at all times the sink isn't being used to avoid smells
with that ‘stache…..I’m waiting for Nate to say “I’ve come to clean ze poooool”
Sometimes that veagan cheese has weird effects on your digestive track I had to stop using it.
Are we going to see the famous Charlie again soon?  I loved your videos with him.  He is awesome!
Love it, keep on sharing..Definitely my favorite channel..I hope the vans water tank is insulated/heated...
What is that pornstache?
When faced by a total mess, just start somewhere and don't stop until the mess is at least organized.
I plan to watch your videos your Bangkok pod sleepover is what drew me in safe travels guys
You have stuff on your stuff!
That was really cool! Safe travels and happy life!
Thank goodness the nose ferret is going 😉
you think -6 is cold? i live in minnesota and the coldest i can remember is -40! at this point i can just walk outside when it’s 20 degrees, no problem. 😂
Love the mustache
-21 that’s warm tonight it’s going down to -37
You guys are absolutely awesome. I wish I was exploring with you.   MANY years ago I made me way thru university as a ski instructor and ski patrol. I have 1 suggestion: when you are working on your slaloms think of your centre of gravity as the middle of your chest, not below your bellybutton as normal. (Get your and my mind out of the gutter…. There’s not enough room for all of us) think of a big grandfather clock pendulum going from side to side. Look further forward to plan your turns. And always plant your inside pole at the apex of each turn.   You will be pros in no time
Please get a couple of ski lessons - does wonders for your technique which will really help with your stamina and overall enjoyment!   Coming from someone who has done ski racing but brought people skiing from beginner to advanced!  Love you guys so much btw!
This makes me want to buy a van! Pumped on following your new adventures!
My baby waves at you guys everytime I turn on a video. We love you guys!
Super
i think you should find a way to secure the blue jug so while you drive it does not move around and potentially spill.
Save the plants eat BACON :)
Yay, more van-life-influencer-wanna'be's clapping their hands together to start videos.
You guys are amazing.
Omg u guys are so productive and so brave of how to show your personal  life style
Can I please have a life like yours?????
00:42  Right here is where I was hoping for a Casey Neistat style unboxing lol
to put on the back of the van
buy a storage trailer
You kept the 'stache!!!!  As someone who has had one from. The age of 16, which allowed me to buy beer for all my peach fuzzed friends, then to be compared by everyone from the likes of Tom Selleck, to Freddie Mercury, keep it bro, hang on to it, it will define you, I promise LOL!   Keep up the great vblogs.......
i have family that lives in toas! such an awesome city
Don't shave the stash! It looks good on you!!
Over 🤣
😁😁😁 buh bye '70s 'stash!! 🤣😂
What did we do to deserve a Wednesday vlog from the favs!?
Today’s my birthday and yall made it better
Awesome video! God bless. Always remember that Jesus Christ loves you all so much! Jesus Christ is King and Savior! Have a great week!❤️🙏
REI needs to sponsor you now. LOL
Cool tripe , i just bought  Eamon and Becs book :)
Welcome to winter in Texas!🥶😊😊
Who is the guy with the mustache? I have not watched in a while
the mustache
When you were getting your ski cloths on did you feel like you were on the Antarctica cruise again
keep the stacheeeee
Love you guys, but Nate get her a better chef knife.
I want a relationship like you guys 🥴maybe not the van life but the relationship I'll take.
You guys inspired me to start skiing I asked for it for Christmas and it’s going to be my second time going this Friday
If the snow from the skis melts and drips down the shower drain, wouldn’t there be water again in the grey water tank, which could freeze?
Hope you guys are getting a residual for all the cook book plugs
Ok I gotta ask, where are we showering then after this remodel ? Haha
What season do you think you guys are on?
Please watch  the flame on the stove next to the window shade!!!!!!
Just love that you are watching Eamon and Bec swimming in the Bahamas while you're surrounded by snow 😄
Well Officer Nate it was nice knowing you knowing 😂😂😂😂
them: its negative 6 out side.. me: i live in Canada it was negative 30 out today🥲
Hang your gas cap on the inside of its door.
Dying at Nate youtubing how to ski.
A great start to getting back to Van life. I have missed your videos and it felt like visiting with old friends ❤️
Ski bum van life is the DREAM
I have one question who do your guys do your Landry
Be happy you are not in Canada currently where I am living it is -35 degrees whoohoo
I love love you two! I can’t wait for your next vlog.
I want some of those Crocs with fur in them
Mexico ? Really not the best of time's to be going there , stay safe very very brave people , or foolish people ..
who else spotted the ESEE knife
Nate, the moustache suits you. Keep it. Great video as always. Thanks :)
Guys we lost another one. That Vegan Teacher is spreading. We lost Kara an Nate.   Lol I’m sorry I had to say it
come to michigan!!
My guys! Give us people with sensory issues a heads up before you scrap ice please, I'm ice cold now and still cringing 😂😂
👍
I love y’all❤️
I loved you guys before, but love you even more that you are trying vegan food. A big thank you for the animals who suffer and a big thank you for the environment and a big thank you for the enjoyment of now watching you cook and eat and from now on I will not fast forward over sponsored ads or when you were eating meat. Loved this episode.❤️
It was Kara’s idea.
Keep the stash! Great video guys. Safe travels and shred it up on the mountains.
why not just get a Thule rack box for the top of the van? store skis and boots and whatever up there.
Love this!!! Can't wait to see the rest of the trip!  Also, I seriously just watched that same Eamon and Bec video this past weekend! Thanks to y'all for introducing me to them...I also bought their 1st cookbook awhile ago and now y'all have sold me on the 2nd one.  *I think they owe you some commission. 😉😁
You were next door to me dangit
13:25 Nate talking way too much for Kara's awakeness, lol!
Road to 3MIL
Lol Nate kept the mustache
How much did you’s pay for the lift passes? I always see that in American Resorts, prices are pretty extortionate, in the Alps, a daily pass will be around 50-60 euros at a top quality resort.
The mustache leaves, bout time my guy
Vegan Food is Amazing ❤😍
I literally am addicted to this YouTube channel I cant stop watching them
Charlie needs to join your videos again!
Saw the Carver surfskate sticker on your water bottle, I have one of those boards too! Great for skating and surf-training!
As someone that loves skiing, it is awesome to see you improve your skills and also have a great time on the slopes! Hopefully at some point when I'm out of school I'm able to enjoy skiing outside of school holidays (which typically means big queues although week after the new year wasn't too bad this year).
Knowing you guys were in Amarillo Texas for a full day and 3 miles from where I live kills me lol wish I could have met you guys!!
CROCS are the best thing ever!
I love this video so much its my dream to live like a ski bum and drive through canada and the US love you vides.
Please tell me y'all have an REI membership and shop the garage sale too, they've got SO much good stuff in the Garage Sale and you can save money. Plus the membership really pays for itself.
I dont know what to say, this channel is truly amazing! CANT WAIT FOR WINTER VAN LIFE!
Make a Ziplock baggie of warm water to rub on the window to remove frost buildup ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Thank you for finally getting back to normal, together, travel videos
You're gonna need your bathing suits tho... #skilife is miserable without some time spent soaking in hot springs, hot tubs, and saunas! P.S. you're trying to boil water at higher elevation, it will always take way longer than expected.
Stomp it ski tutorials ftw !
Lose the moustache, you look like a used car salesman from Cookeville, TN :-)
You think -6 is bad I LIVE SOMEWHERE WERE SOMTIMES IT CAN  BE -38
I bought those identical knock off crocs from Walmart too, best $13 I ever spent
I’m so happy you are back !!!!!
Why don't you guys have a fridge anymore?
Nate has a shaved moustache in the sponsor part
SO excited to follow your trip as you go down the Baja Pennisula. I'm looking to do the same in the next 2 years. I've driven to Ensenda but never farther.
This video is a banger!
My dad lives in this town called Edgewood, New Mexico. He and my step moms family love going up to Taos to ski and they enjoy it. I can’t wait to see your adventures over the next couple of weeks.
When you poured out the cumin powder I had flash backs to the cinnamon explosion… that will ALWAYS be the funniest thing EVER! 😂😂
-4 would be tropical right now in NS Canada 🇨🇦!
DONT SHAVE IT!
I love the mustache you are killing it definitely keep it
When are you guys coming up to North Dakota? It might be hard to find civilization but we're out here haha! Come up and see us, you'll have more fun than you expect to. You just have to go to the right cities (Fargo or Grand Forks)
Awesome to see you guys are trying Veganuary! Hope you enjoy it and consider continuing it! From New Zealand 🇳🇿
Clearly, you guys aren't from Wisconsin. Today, the high was -10F and honestly, thats not that bad for right now.
The panty tree, welp lol
You guys encouraged me to get back into skiing after not skiing for years and it’s so much fun. Stay warm and happy skiing! ❤️
Summmer: conditioner 50% needed  Winter: 527% needed
Shave the stach...yay!!!!  This won't get a heart from Kara.   It ok.
Ready for winter nzte? Its mid january, in 2 1/2 months dpring will arrive
I LOVE WATCHING YOU GUYS DO VEGANUARY!! Eamon and Bec make such good food and it’s so cool watching you make their recipes and also promoting veganuary. Really awesome of you x
That was a great video ! Really fun to watch.
Am I the only person who never stopped smiling while watching the video?
You guys are awesome.
Nate:  MONOCHROMATIC MINIMALIST lol
Watching Kara and Nate pretend to enjoy van life is just getting akward and weird at this point, starting to lose all authenticity. I’d rather see them making content about stuff they genuinely love.
It’s either a caterpillar or a 70’s porn stash on Nate’s upper lip
Y'all just make me happy lol and also make me want to ski?? My husband would love that! Also the reason I say y'all now lolll Thank youuuuu can't wait for the next one! Stay safe!
When my husband retires in 8 years we are planning on getting ourselves a nice van so we can travel about the country and play at as many disc golf courses as possible. It's fun for me to watch your channel and dream of our own adventures. Thanks for your inspiration.
The music overlays in this video are ON POINT! Great tunes.
You should go to philmont, it’s in cimeron right where u guys are going. Eagles best is right next to it and you can see baldy mountain.
bro the stache gotta go. lol
I heard Kara say about the levers on the water pipes! And yes, shave it Nate! X
Love you guys xxxx
So the van us winter proof but how will you shower? Or wash clothes?
Great work guys and wow that is cold! Keep safe!
The higher the altitude the harder it is to bring water to a boil.
Totally disappointed in your disgusting way you left your van maybe your getting to much money from youtube
AHHHH GOOD JOB ON #21 ON TRENDING <3
That looked amazing!! I’m only fifteen, nearly sixteen, and often ski on blacks, and double blacks in New England and it’s forever been a dream to ski in Colorado, Utah, New Mexico, etc, and seeing y’all do it is incredibly inspiring! Thank you for sharing y’all’s journey, been here since 2018. :)
Dose anyone have an extra banana because I ran out and my cat is getting really mad
DON´T SHAVE THE STACHE NATE!! I´m with Kara, it looks really good on you!
I’m actually getting used to the mustache. 😂
I love the skiing clips! Looks like so much fun. 😃
I want to go! I live near Phoenix and I Love ❤️ Cabo ! Check out some other van life people. Great ideas 💡
Is it just me or does anyone else feel like Nate really needs to shave the mustache? I cant get use to it. Please Nate, no more stache! I will still love you guys & continue to watch no matter what! Excited to see what 2022 has instore for you & us!
Thanks for this video & the memories …. Forty years ago we used to sleep at the mountain ski resorts in the van … mostly on the weekends.  …Now I am an old lady who lives in Florida!!  😉.  I could feel my weight shift as I skied down the ski runs with you.  ⛷🚡
How are you able to survive so many days without taking a shower? I take two per day and I can not imagine arriving from skiing and not having a place to shower 🙈
You guys just need a bigger van. It would drive me nuts living somewhere that small!!
With the new drain system, I can just see these two screaming: "Oh no! There is water everywhere!" 🤣🤣🤣
What does the nutrient drink in the ad taste like?
Hey guys, to find skiing easier I would suggest not throwing your shoulders when you turn, keep them facing down slope or direction of the slope. Hope this helps!
propane box in new location is vented to outside I Hope ? yall gonna Skip showers or stay at a campground with shower house?
Noooooo not crocs lol 😆😆😆😆😆😆😆
Nate wear sunscreen!
“Are you punching me in the face on purpose?” “Uh huh.” 😂 married people morning conversations
Nate still got his stash!
Sure it's time to change this channel's name to - Kara, Nate, and Moustache
“I’ll bring mine tomorrow” why I am baffled that came out of her mouth 😭
Flipping awesome and entertaining as usual. I love your down to earth realness. Thanks for the celcius conversation for us Canadians. Am I missing something? Can you not put ski racks on the top of your van like we do here in the great white north?
Thank you Kara and Nate for putting the tempetures in °C too. It's really helpful!🙂❤️
When you guys stop by AZ come say hi!!
What kind of heater are you using in the van?
I live in okc and guys were so close
Thanks for taking us down the sloaps⛷️ Taos is serious skiing.
SHAVE THE MOUSTACHE
Thank You Guys. Always, great stuff. Keep smiling Kara😁😁  Jim and Harriet . Richmond, Va.
You guys eed to do mont owls head one day it located in Québec Canada
Is it just me or Nate should be a model
We have more than -10 in Massachusetts Celsius
Ok but how are you going to get clean if the shower does not work
I LOVE THIS!  so excited about this trip! Its already amazing, i love the ideas and love the feel of it.
I swear I thought I heard Kara say “Stoodis” while putting her gloves on 😂 if you guys have Disney+ Reservation Dogs is a must watch!
Nate, I'm sure this comes too late because of your filming/posting delay, but I'd say keep the 'stash and add a neatly trimmed beard to it.
I love you guys 💖💖💖
I’m not a huge snow person despite being a Wisconsin native but OH BOY did this make me want to go skiing!!! Always love the vlogs ❤️
Awww, I love your friendship with Eamon and Bec... 💕 my favorite YouTube couples
I like your mustache I guess you married Mario
It funny here here y’all complaining about the cold in Wisconsin I had school today and it’s -17
You should really buy a 12 V socket heater
#savethestache
word of advice for the gray water bucket. 1. get something to hold it in place, a strap, bungy cord, rope anything to keep it from sloshing around and moving so much when you drive. 2. do something to seal the top around the pipe you put into it. you can cut  a hole in the cap that came with it and use plumbers putty, tape anything will really work. just something to keep water from splashing out when your driving. otherwise you might end up with some water in that compartment which could cause water damage or possibly even mold  as for the water freezing in the walls, it looks like you have pex pipes which are burst resistant, they will expand when frozen but it is very dificult to make them burst
You should say hi to Mr and Mrs Adventure!
Great video Kara and Nate Van Life is back I love watching your adventures , this time skiing in the mountains of New Mexico awesome . Look froward seeing more of Van Life.
NATE IM BEGGING U GET RID OF THAT NASTINESS ON YOUR UPPER LIP PLEEEEEEEEEASE!!!!!!!!!!!!
your videos make me so happy
NATE IM BEGGING U GET RID OF THAT NASTINESS ON YOUR UPPER LIP PLEEEEEEEEEASE!!!!!!!!!!!!
Kara finding so much joy in ending every transmission with "Over" is part of the reason I love this channel. It is something I do at work all day every day, it's become so routine. That made me smile.
When are you going to Wisconsin!!!!
I want y’all to come to WI soooooooo bad
God  how about come to Albany Western Australia and drive up north, I’m from Albany Western Australia bigger than Texas and you can apparently fit 7 Germanys in
What does AG1 taste like!! Plz respond!!🥺🥺
AG1, the terrible tasting all in one drink they they say is healthy....lol. Id rather drink terrible soda and be happy than drink that mess and be miserable while drinking it. Word of advice, you don't need an all in one drink to be healthy. You could drink water and get the same results. I know they sponsored you guys, but these all in one drink companies are a scam. Find better sponsorships.
Nate made the mess poetic!
It's weird seeing Nate with a mustache
Shave the mustache
Use bubble wrap on the windows it’ll stop it from getting ice-they need to be damp but not wet so it’ll stick.
You should put RV antifreeze in the pipes you are not using.  It is safe and made for setting up RV pipes for the winter..
🙈 I am native Coloradan 🏞️ since 1971, who never went skiing because as a child👣 I got hooked on snow 🍩 tubing!!❤️ #davesandersstepdaughter
I miss it when this used to be a travel channel. Now, your content is getting more and more boring.
Why don't you just get RV antifreeze and keep some of that in the bottom of your grey tank.  Each time you empty, add some more.
Maybe I missed it, but how are you showing and going to the bathroom if you converted your shower.
Okay everybody sing: rolling rolling rolling keep that  van a  rolling  rolling out rawhide. Thinking about that sunshine go to Florida sunshine you’ll be a freezing  about singing rawhide hello from Clearwater. Yes I’m a smartie
Nate kinda looks like dusty🤣
I love that E&B sponsored this video! (Jk) but seriously prob going to buy their book after seeing you cook all these amazing meals. I want to go skiing now.
Hi
anyone else annoyed with vegans? I must be showing my age..
My Favorite place to ski TAOS ... been there so many times!
Kara you should get an electric blanket. They have them that plug into cars and wall outlets both
Good luck and I hope you did what you did because I can’t watch the whole thing right this minute and I have a 55 item marketing list to attend to and after that Kara can smile. If I had a YouTube channel everyone member of The Florida Bar will be extremely ticked off because confidentiality will be breached because my husband is an attorney.otherwise, I would write about my writing
being an OG watcher and hearing Charlie make an appearance brought a smile to my face!
Please add a vent out the bottom of your van for the propane tank. It needs to be vented otherwise the propane could build up in that box. Propane is heavier than air and will sink if the hole is at the bottom. The box is worse than useless if it isn't vented as it just contains any potential leaks and lets the propane build up to dangerous levels 😆
Omg I'm gonna be in Beaver Creek and Vail at the end of the month! Hope to maybe see y'all out on the slopes :) (Also RIP mustache, you will be missed!!)
I’m hoping and waiting for a camper van Renovation series whit Eamon and Bec of your van, I think it would be fun.  Since you have said before you hate it
That’s so cool I’m going to toas in a week
Would you put a link up for the site that you found the casino and water please?
You probably have to keep the heater running during daytime as well. Also take care of your batteries. If they are lithium they can't (won't) charge below freezing, most are configured a few degrees higher as cuttoff point. Depending on the location of the batteries they might be very cold, or in worst case too cold to charge (unless you have heated ones). Lead-acid is no problem.
Do yall have a PO Box? I wanna send you an invite to my wedding because I love yall so much but I can't seem to find it! It's April 30th in Northern, IL
Women always have to remind yo whose idea something was
Love seeing you guys back in your van! Kudos going Vegan this month! As a vegan, I hope you decide to become a vegan eventually- so good for your health, save animals etc❣️ You’re both such great athletes- loved watching you ski! I love AG- need to order some more as I took a break - xoxo can’t wait to see your next video
NATE PLEASE SHAVE UR MUSTASH
Wondering why you didn't just get a ski rack and put it on you van roof.
I love that you guys are doing Veganuary! I am too but in an effort to become fully plant based and omit all the processed foods.
Shave the stache, let the hair grow.
Confidence..  That feeling you have before you fully understand the situation.
This was so much fun to watch.  Seems like you're getting your groove with van life hacks, improvements and the best uses for space.  Don't feel bad about the troubleshooting that Kara figured out Nate.  Some women just have great mechanical reasoning abilities.  You'll always have the stove.  Hehehe!  God bless.
hey Canadian here. I love your videos so much and this was a great one! Just some tips from a Canadian ski bum  1. make sure your boots are warm before you put them on it will make all the difference. Either stick them beside a heater for at least  20mins or get a boot warmer for your locker. 2. idk if this was just editing but make sure to give the vans engine plenty of time to warm up before driving when its cold ( like at least 5 minutes)
Thank you for adding Celsius temps.
Kara and Nate , take a look at Ladi &Margarets video on insulation .  think it was about 2 weeks ago. Margaret mentions the back door and using some insulation to cut down on the condensation and cold.  might be a simple add to the back doors.
Your videos are so amazing. I love watching your adventures!!
Love it!! I can't ski so all I imagined was skiing right off the cliff... 😳
Such a great episode. Wish I could be there shredding right now! And that view every morning is amazing 🏔🏔
Who else’s Siri got turned on and to old them about the weather from when Nate said ahaha
Hi I really love your Chanel!!
You can buy bitcoin
Sorry Kara... that pornstache has got. to. go.
Skilife is the new van life !! I’d watch and be engrossed even more - how many ski resorts can you get to in one year … there’s a thought 👍
I love your videos especially when improve your van
Can u shave this mustaches  pls
I literally work at that lowes and didn't realize that was yall.
When I saw u guys posted again, I WAS SO EXCITED! I LOVE YOUR GUYS VIDEOS AND ADVENTURES SO MUCHHH! :)
Awwwww Taos! My favorite place on earth! It might be easier to stay down in town or in Arroyo Seco if they have spots. Slightly less cold anyway. 😬 Taos Ski Valley is kind of expert level skiing btw.  Good German food up in Ski Valley tho.. and Orlando’s in El Prado (La Reina) or Ranchos Plaza Grill (stacked Christmas cheese enchiladas) for New Mexican food. Five Star for great Burgers. 💚
Nate you really really REALLY need to get rid of that awful mustache sorry
So glad you returned to spend some time in New Mexico!
Hi kara and nate
💜
Safe travels & thanks for the laughs 😆 I was cracking up while watching this video.
Hubby and I both think you should lose the mustache Nate!  You don't have any need to cover any part of your face! By the way we loved the video with your grandparents!
Hang your gloves by the fingers or you are creating a soap in your fingers!
also aren't you supposed to just turn the car on and heat that inside ice off with that instead of scraping ice in? :P food for thought.. also also its unfair we always get a bunch of likes on your videos most ppl just do it like me before even watching. reverse it, make it comments for shaving and likes for not shaving.
Casinos have excellent security, so if they are available they are far superior to a Walmart.
I love you guys!
Those crocs the best think ever I have a par of them to
You have expiered me to more to can life when I'm older
have you guys thought about when you are old what the plans are for van life?
Great video I enjoyed the skiing  ! God bless ❤
I have been WAITING and WAITING and WAITING for a Charlie return!! I've missed his cameos!!
Is that some slight Eva zu beck music I hear??
Do not drive at night in Mexico make sure you get to a safe location with security that's gated where you're going to stay at night. Absolutely NO CAMPING on your own Mexico is dangerous. Do not leave your van unattended unless it's in a secure gated parking lot they will smash and grab and take everything  no one will stop them. Mexico has a big drug problem and with that comes all the problems related to it. Do not pull over for an unmarked car with a police light they're not real cops they're going to rob you happens all the time especially at night . I've been going down to Baja for 30 years I've seen it change for the worse I don't drive to Cabo anymore except during the Baja 1000 lots of Americans on the road there's always someone to help if you need it
Ha, you haven't seen winter until you've lived through a northern Minnesota hell season. A crap ton of snow and anywhere between 20 to 60 below. As soon as we retire and can afford a camper, we're out of this hell.
Tip for you Nate, DOOOO NOT put the cap on the gas bar, you will totally loose it there. Put it on the rim of the door where if you shut it, the cap will stop it, or  put it upside down on your seat.
Don’t shave your mo
Not sure I could do van life in the cold without a hot shower but it’s a beautiful view! Kudos on the skiing!
The moustache rocks!!!  Loved the quote about vegan cheese 😂
So excited to hear from Charlie!!
love watching your videos makes me feel like i’m there with you it gives me a way to open up to everything and makes me wonder about my like in 10-15 years
Hopefully you added winter cooliant so the radiator doesn't crack
Any time Nate says propane I get soooo nervous 😬
I think you should both try to lean more foreword.
Water takes longer to boil at higher altitudes. That some potential reason it took longer to cook the soup.
NAT , Pls shave that tache off
Sorry Nate, I am in the no moustache camp.
Who's Monica??  😆  had to laugh as I instantly got the reference.
Thanks peps for overwhelming likes, his creepy look was getting to me, yes shave it off.plz
Oh look it’s Nate the Mexican
just so you know ocd isn’t being a perfectionist or wanting everything to be super clean. it’s a disorder where you get intrusive thoughts and compulsions to do things and if you don’t do them then this voice tells you something bad will happen to you. i get irritated when everyone compares these struggles to being a perfectionist and if it’s not a valid mental illness. this isn’t hate as i love your content but i just want to educate you :)
I just smile through your guys videos, thank you for sharing your adventures with us! You guys are so wholesome. I'm so excited to see the future adventures! My boyfriend and I are dream of having a van like you guys!
Kara, the Italians will say: tre panini al formaggio!
Amarillo is ama-rio it’s yellow in Spanish
You two are an absolute delight!  Always a pleasure to watch!  Thanks for sharing your epic adventures
You guys should really switch to a diesel heater.. by the looks of all the frost on the inside, you are using propane. Having a small diesel heater tapped into your main tank would be so beneficial to you…
Keep it! Don't shave! Kara you're such a lovely person Nate is lucky to have you and vice-versa keep exploring for us
So brave for spending the night in a parking lot in Albuquerque! 🤣
Man you guys make the best vlogs.
I always love to watch your video You have fabulous day 🤗 God bless both of you guys 👼👼👼👼
Loved this video so much!! Can’t wait till you come to Utah ❤️
Is it just me or are there other people that  also think the the grey water will start spilling out of the blue tank once it's nearly full and Kara and Nate start driving on some bumpy roads (or slam the brakes)? I'm sure we'll find out soon enough. 🤣
love this couple you guys are the best.
question for the gray water: what happens when y’all leave the van for hours to ski and the water freezes? will it crack the tank or is there another measure in place?
💗🥂
You should try snowboarding!!!!! I love it
for some reason, that mountain parking lot made me think of that time WHERE ALL OF THESE KIDS started to come around the van and say hi. remember that?
Loves Gas stations will be your best friend. Gas, Diesel, propane, water and dump stations… awesome video guys! See you out there!
I live next to a mountain, and everyday when I look out the window, I can see the mountain probably better from my cheap 3rd floor walkup than most people literally across the street who paid many hundreds of thousands of dollars to live in a McMansion... xD I prefer the view. They can keep the maintenance bills! lol
Loved this video!
Cut your beard off
Another awesome vlog guys! Love the raw aspect but still fits in the story🤙 Glad you guys upgraded the van for Ski season!⛷  Also a little tip for the ice on the windshield, you guys can buy a spray for anti frosting❄️ Cheers guys!
Why is that thing on Nate's upper lip? My comment, in no way, should be interpreted as support of that thing! Trust me, you'll regret having video evidence of that in just a year year or two!
Please PLEASE PLEASE shave the mustache!!!
The shot of your van under  the stars was really pretty.
I am so early!! I love y'all!! I look up to yall sooo much I want to live In a van when I grow up because of you and your Vlogs!!
U guys need to get a massage gun for when u come off the slopes... for under a hundred dollars u can improve ur comfort a ton!!! Have a great time!!!
You advertise Athletic Greens, with the tin thats “always in the fridge” just 60 seconds or so after saying you have removed your fridge 😂
DON'T SHAVE THE 'STAAAACHE 😂 Loving the cozy winter vibes of this vlog!
Please be careful NOT to burn the window covering in the kitchen with the gas stove...
Glad you are back on the road...missed you!  I would like to know where you got that close line.  My grandson might like one for his skoolie
I have done the pepper flakes in a pan myself, Its literally like getting mace in the face LOL
off with the pedo stach lol
This is inspiring.  Now I am (almost) motivated to start on my list of projects.
“And now we’re going GAAaaAAAMbiiiiiiinngGgg” 😂😂😂😂
You guys need to update your banner!
Sorry Kara, but I didn't even realize this was y'all in the thumbnail! That mustache 😳
Please shave your mustache (you got your likes on the previous video)
I’m soooo ready for this!!!
WAS SUCH A NICE SURPRISE TO GET THIS VIDEO TODAY!
Nate looks like a dad with his mustache
-20? pathetic compared to Canada a while ago it was -40! and there was people including me wearing jeans and hoodies!!!!!!!!!
You know it's an amazing day when kara and nate upload! You guys never dissapoint with the uploads, keep up the hard work and dedication!
Omg pls tell me Charlie is coming back to travel with you guys!!
You guys are project dynamos!
Nate looks like a early 50's British army personnel
I barely recognized Nate when the thumbnail for this video popped up 😂  I feel like you should wait for Mexico to shave, it’ll keep your face warm in the snow.
Omg why were they so productive today tho?
Nate, LOVE the channel...BUT, is that stache open for discussion:)
To save money on ski rentals go to a Christy sports (because they are a chain) and get a seasonal rental
That looks soo FUN!
Wow what an amazing video and such a fun couple to watch! I’m so happy I found your channel. You guys put such a big smile on my face :) excited for the future videos!
From an experienced snowboarder, don't skimp on getting the right snow gear. It can make all the difference in the world. Keeping warm (but not over heated) and dry is so important as I'm sure you've experienced. Outer layer that has zipper vents you can open up and air out while going down the slopes and zip up while on the chair lift is a nice touch. A simple snow mask to cover your nose/mouth when winds get high and temps get really cold can be a trip saver. I don't know if the van will ever need chains but might be good to have a set just in case. Have fun!!!
Hey guys. Why don’t you just buy a small trailer to pull behind the van?
Can tell you guys have been hanging out with Eamon from those renovations
I would have went gambling with you Kara!
It's the "Marci Bra" tree!
Your propane tank should not be inside, not safe, nor good for your health
love ur beard Nate!!!!!! and love ur outfits Kara!!!
Nate you look mexican with that stash, it  looks cool bro. And Kara, you rock every day
i like the mustache but you guys do so much good for your insides  of like to see a winter skin care routine... it gets extra chapped in the writer time
y’all would hate where i live in canada it’s been -25 to -30°c for the last week and for the next 2 weeks. that’s -14 to -22 F
Thanks sooooo much for putting in the Celsius temperature every time you say a Fahrenheit temperature.
Seems like the shower takes up too much space and you don’t use it very much.
oh man. jealous of that EMPTY mountain
My biggest question is how, when and where do you shower? I wouldn’t give up my shower!! Do You rent skies and boots?
Oh and I live in Dallas and you left on my birthday!
Love the new floors for you! 💫
Would u guys ever consider getting a trailer for storage?
I was wondering why you hadn't shaved yet. You had 50k likes the day after that video posted. The stache makes you look like the villain on Dudley Doright. Snidely Whiplash.
Lol the “stashe” …. Dirty sanchez just has to go! Lmao.    Nate you’re not a porn star?
You should have put the ramen and almonds together and toasted them.  It’s better than raw ramen 😂
Are you guys going to get one of those celebrity rv vans
One of my favorite videos so far!
SHAVE UR MUSTACHE LOL
I love that you guys have become such good friends with Eamon and Bec I love both of your channels so much <3
Please start actually using the metric system more. The american system makes absolutely no sense.
As a 4 season native I feel like I should tell you, in the future, you can just turn the defrost on hi for a few more minutes and internal ice will evaporate. Kinda like when it's on the outside, except it evaporates vs melts. No mess.
I'm so happy for another video this week! Watching you guys are a part of my usual routine now and seeing you guys marks a smile on my face. Great life and road adventures 💗
Loved this video and following you guys ..... Great work on the slopes not sure sking is for me I don't mind the cold but I think that would be a little to cold for me oh and I'm to clumsy I would probably break a leg hahaha
Since your shower will be busy maybe get a planet fitness membership so you can shower for $24 a month
Whenever Kara and Nate post it’s always a good day!!
Omg, guys, how happy and cheerful you are in this video! :) Enjoy the trip!
Fellow van lifers here! Currently in Houston doing similar winter renovations for our van! Love the videos as always, and maybe we'll see you in Baja in a few months!
You guys have to be careful with the back burner and your window curtains. Being so close to the pot or burn can send things south very quickly! You guys are awesome👌
What a life❤️❤️
Wonder if that gray water is going to start smelling pretty bad being inside the van
Yes! Finally, death to that mustache. Death I say.
I build a whole trailer camper in lowes parking lot
Nate : <<scraping ice off inside of windshield >> Me : oh god, OH God, OH GOD, STOP, PLEASE STOP!!
Cosco has ski coats also
Kara is skiing so well for a newbie! Look up some drills for upper and lower body separation and you will both feel so much more solid on your skis. It may seem like a waste of time, but they will honestly make such a difference to your skiing seeing as you are both so athletic.
My husband is an engineer! And is always amazed when my ideas are better than his. I get it. Milk that thing, girl!
Can you do a YouTube short on why you chose the sprinter van
That if you confess with your mouth, "Jesus is Lord," and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.  Romans 10:9 😁
a hack for getting ice off of the INSIDE of the window is using an old gift card and scrape using that! Using a scraper takes way too long!  #canadianhacks - LOVE YOU GUYS!!!
I agree Nate, shave off your mustache. You look so much better without it. Great video. Be safe,.
Hi I love your guesses videos I watched a lot of them I've been watching aggressive videos for 4 years is now or 5 years now
Perfect video! You guys are too fun. I’m so happy I found your channel!!! Thank you for sharing your life with us!
When kara n Nate post a video my day is complete 😂❤️👍
I LOVE the longer videos!! So great you guys!! Can't wait to see where 2022 brings you.
You need storage boxes at the back of the van to give yourself some more storage space
I think i've seen van mini project videos from you guys a couple of times already. Why dont you just totally remodel your van how you would like to be?
I bet when Kara gets mad at Nate she says "ur sleeping in the van tonight"
Nate is giving me Waluigi vibes with that mustache XD
Fave travel vloggers ever ❤️❤️❤️
You guys should check out Mavrik Joos. He filmed his trip to the end of the peninsula a while back and he stayed with a fantastic couple on their ranch for his first few nights, Raul and Caroline I believe. I think it was called La Bellotta. They are a great place for overland travelers to go since they give awesome tips on going to the end of the peninsula!
Your videos are lengthy but worth it.  Keep it up. Great video as always.
You guys bring me so much joy ! Enjoy your trips!!
I heart you guys. I wish I was 35 years younger so I could use these as a tutorial on how to enjoy life.
KEEEP THE MOUSTACHE
What is the name of the app Nate uses to find places to stay?
love the mustache!
The 🌽 ⭐️ mustache must go! Yay! 👏🏼
Viewer brought to you by 🥓
I can't get over how good you look with this stash and hair lenght Nate! Kara is a lucky lady!
I totally agree with Nate in the vegan Cheese!! So excited to see ya'll traveling again
I’m honestly so excited to Ski season with Kara and Nate 😍
"I hope this is a life investment" it is! Ski clothes are DEFINITELY a life investment because it lasts for so many seasons! - atte. a 20 year old who still fits in her ski pants and jacket and undergarments from when she was 14.
Thank you for a mid week bonus! I laughed so many times watching this. 🤣 you guys are too cute!
Lmao 🤣 I love love how much this vlog made me laugh and  smile 😊.  My face hurts. I’m so excited for your adventure. Happy skiing ⛷
nice to have you guys back
Crocs are just the best for skiing, taking your boots off at the end of the day and slip into this light weight shoes feels amazing 😀👍🏻
Omg! Miss Charlie!! He has to come for a visit
Yayyy! Y’all are BACK! So excited! And, Nate.. it was totally Karas’ idea. 😂🤗 Excited to see what this year holds for you two AND us followers! ❤️
If its possible you should hook up the blue gray water tank inside the Van with the outdoor gray water tank so you would have even more space for gray water, maybe you should consider making it airtight so it wouldn't smell. (Ofc. first when your done with the epic cold adventures) I love the videoes! From Denmark!
DON’T SHAVE NATE!!!
nate got veins 🔥🔥🔥
21:47 nate looks like the soup nazi from seinfeld..... LOL i can't unsee it
They are fantastic people I am following them since 2018 for me they are like family...love u both!
Watching this while I fold my laundry :) I love hanging out with you guys while I do house chores. Stay warm dudes
Love fur lined crocs!
Kara..get off Amazon…the vacuum seal storage bags for your clothes..they come with the vacuum pump too..I love them..
Don't you need a device to prevent the stink from coming out of the new gray tank? In a home its the trap full of water. Pretty sure there is RV equivalent. Has like a check valve or something. Seen it in other van builds
Pretty sure the cereal wasn't vegan.
YEAH!!!  shave that mustache :)
I love this type of content!
not going to lie nate the mustache really threw me off but it looks good. can't wait for the next vid
Hey, i live in Colorado and going up skiing over the weekend, i love you channel, and was wondering what mountain you guys are going to in Colorado
Love the mustache!! Circles a great smile!!
Ok but what does AG1 taste like?
I had fun watching this new content
Noo, keep the stache Nate! xD
honestly one of my favorite week in the life vlogs!! ❤️ seeing nate successful with updating the van,  yall supporting eamon and bec, seeing how eamon and bec made such an impact on yalls lifes and, just such wholesome content!! i hope to meet yall someday, youre so inspiring! ❤️ safe travels xx
Ski newbies not putting the bar on the lift down. Never thought I will call Kara and Nate classical Americans 😂 as someone coming from a ski nation and who skis 30+times a season, but the god damn bar down.
Next time you might consider going to a second hand store when you need to buy clothes, jackets, ski/snow wear. ... We live in Florida and when we go somewhere "winter" second hand is the way to go especially if you don't have much storage when "summer" returns you can donate the stuff.
I just binged all your videos from when covid first happened! Crazy
If y’all come through Boulder, CO. You can park on our block! :)
In my opinion you guys are really the best and most honest van lifers on YouTube and I love it! Keep it up ❤️ also, Nate's mustache is epic 😂
Can't tell you how happy I was watching this video! :) I was smiling the entire time. you guys are great!!!! my favourite videos to watch. Enjoy the slopes and have fuuuuuun!
Great video guys, yall make skiing look so easy.....Jason has been trying to get me to go so we will have to see. Thanks for sharing!
You should be able to hook the gas cap onto the gas cap door to ensure you don’t lose it.
Why does the thaught of a 1970s porn actor come to mind?
Love your Chanel hope your trips are fun
Nates moostache needs to be trimmed not to exceed the sides of his mouth.  It looks great and amazing but its too wide.  I keep looking at it😳😕 my hubbie noticed it first. DONT SHAVE IT OFF!!  He looks way younger
I was wondering if you had been off playing in a porn movie with that stach, lol. Or maybe you were just trying to keep your upper lip warm since you were going skiing. 😂
Great video as always! But I’m pretty sure there is still water in the pipes that go to the shower. Just not enought pressure to push it out the end. Maybe im wrong tho🤔🙄
I love how Kara and Nate teamwork, so excited to see you guys on the road again too!
Mustache….makes me laugh 😂😂😂😂😂
I can’t remember how your furnace works, is it propane or electric?  Glad it kept you warm. Don’t forget to dump that indoor grey tank, they get stinky. Loved the video makes me want to go skiing! Hope you wore lots of sunscreen on your face Nate for that high altitude sun.
The mustache must GO!!  Either that or find the pink panther already!  (Just teasing!)
I'm a huge fan and look forward to your travels. I have to say that the stove flame with the curtain covering the sliding door windows was a little too close for comfort for me.(35 yrs food service) Is it just the camera angle that makes it appear so close to burner/ flame??
DONT SHAVE, I love the new look!
Where are they skiing?
And Nate, it's time to lose the Villain Mustache
I love their videos!! They never fail to entertain!
Nate, loose the stache
the edititng is so good on this guys!!!
Thank God, you're getting rid of that germ infested moustache! Facial hair can contain more bacteria than the average toilet seat. Look it up, I'm not lying. So Gross!!!!
appreciate the temperature to celsius😉
Kara is so good at editing!! The way she arranges every clip, insert references. The effort that goes into making a video is just.. I made a 5 minute video last week and I lost my whole week to it. Kara doing doing 30 minutes, 1.30 hrs and stuff is just inhumane in a good way
I really like your cheerful videos. It’s the reason I follow you. BUT pls keep your videos out of that vegan staff. I just stop watching E&B bc they had too much that veganism. It’s fine if you like vegan food, but don’t add that in videos. You rather be full time veggies for your own will, but copying that for someone else is just matter of pleasing. It’s not real you and that fakeness annoys. I’m sorry.
Why’s Nate still got the moustache?
My husband and I have such different YouTube channels we watch but Kara and Nate we always watch together.  Your ski adventure looks so fun!   Have a blast!  Ps:  not to beat a dead horse but how about some new kara and nate merch?
Maybe you will run into Mr and Mrs Adventure in the Baja ...that would be a great meet up.
CHARLIE!! I miss him!!
Or pipe fitters have a pvc tube that runs along the roof and side they carry their pipes in works for skies too!  Also YOU LOOK LIKE YOUR BROTHER
Truck stops
Funny how YouTube helps you to watch irrelevant things.
🇿🇦♥️♥️
Check out boot dryers/warmers. We have both the dry guy travel and force dry models. Putting on warm dry boots is a game charger.
Great video can't wait for the next one 😀
I appreciate the F to C conversion
🥰
They have ski lockers that mount on the back of your van.
I just love you guys!!! This video was so great, i had fun WITH you both on this journey! ❤️❤️
C'mon, you didn't think all that stuff would fit?  It was mostly Amazon. Everyone knows if you get a giant box from Amazon it will have another box inside with something the size of a nail clipper inside
Yay!! If I liked cold this would be a very convincing video to try  ⛷
This video actually made me super happy. Even though I’m stuck at home felt like I was there with you guys. Thank you!
How about a rear crate carrier yah know for bikes, pet carriers and xtra storage then when you open the back doors its like an xtra step
No offence ... BUT Nate looks like a porn star with that moustache 🤭😂🥴
Happy New Year!!
can yall just like adopt me? im 19 and all but like your living the life of my dreams 😫😫
Get rid of the mustache
I love you guys and all your positivity, but I have to say, I’m not fond of the influence that Eamon and Bec have with you guys. Please stay true to yourselves <3
WoW love you guys
is it like, a thing for skiers to toss their undergarments into trees? I remember when i went skiing there was something similar to what Kara and Nate saw. is it just a joke among regulars or is it blatant disrespect for the site?
Take note: at altitude, water takes longer to boil, Kara!
Knock-off Crocs and a pornstache. Nate is quite the catch ladies.
I have a great place you can go with all your winter gear.  Edmonton Canada trust me, you will need it just to leave the van.
5 minutes in. Did you guys make a hole on the floor to vent the propane tank ?
Maybe gas cap reattachment could happen with a few zip ties hooked together, like a chain /shrug
LOL, I always cough because of pepper too, didn't know others did that as well.
What can I say, Well done and adorable.
Wasn’t there an agreement  about the mustache…
Congradulation On Your Skiiing
+I live by the beach in North east Baja, San Felipe Great camping I have space so stop in overnight
Link to that black padding. Going to do the same to my RV floor to protect it from my MTB
I liked the last video only because it was a good video but I want the mustache to stay!!!
Van life are my favorite videos at the moment 🥰🥰 is so natural and just showing us your amazing life story…. Keep them coming!!🥰
I like your prayer flags
stay safe my guys and have fun
Please guys I feel bad for your unorganised van 😂. Stay organised, you will save a lot of time and maybe get some peace✌🏽
Get rid of that tiny van and get a RV like Endless adventure. Or a newer RV.
No don’t Nate you better not I hope you didn’t
I thought u said that if it got 50k u wouldn't shave it?
Those temps we call a Tuesday in Minnesota….
Love your channel
I like  his moustache but I like the curls better.
You guys were in my home town Santa Fe and I had no idea! What 😱 I love you guys and your content! Big fan over here and I’m so happy you guys enjoyed your stay in beautiful Taos!
I love watching you guys!! You two are the greatest and humorous too. Much love from Wisconsin!!! 🤪🥰
Love watching you guys but I am sorry Kara I really do not like Nate’s mustache. Prefer watching him without it.
all Im looking at is nates moustache
Yall really should get a trailer
Um can we hang out and I can learn to ski with Kara? I think that's a good plan! 🤣
Just love you two…… Kara you’re great… and Nate I think I prefer you without the mustache… SORRY…..GREAT SKIIING!
Yes welcome to my winter van life, camping out in the mountains and snowboarding is the life to me. The parking lot lodge makes it even better!
looks amazing! All except the vegan part! lol
OCD is so stigmatized and misunderstood. Unless you have a clinical diagnosis don’t claim to be “so ocd” about something. That devalues the struggles of those of us who battle it every single day. I don’t appreciate that Kara. Please stop.
Hope you guys enjoyed NM! It's a beautiful state and I love living here. You guys have to come back in October for the Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta!
22:11 Nate looks french beecose of his hair and the moustache
Taos....my favorite ski area of all time.
guys you don't have to do this
I really appreciate that the temperature is also shown in celcius. I just love that they thought about every other country that does not uses Fahrenheit.
Great, next video will star Kara & Nate instead of Kara & Snively Whiplash.😀😀
The mustache looks great, Nate!
Well done guys a good film. We missed you and you come back big. Stay safe and warm.😎
Can’t wait for your next video
I love you videos! I live  in a beautiful little ski town in Colorado. I would be happy to give you guys some suggestions and possibly a beautiful free place to park and stay!  Let me know if you are interested.
OMG I've missed Charlie SO MUCH!! Once the world is back to normal please go visit him in Australia!
Great video both….joyous and wonderful.  Glad you got 80000 as I just can’t get used to the stache.  Keep on keeping on and enjoy the slopes.  You ski like I did….fun to watch.  You guys are the real deal ...all the best...Chris 🇨🇦
I absolutely love watching your videos. 🤗
Is it just me or Kara and Nate are always saying "this is the best trip we've ever taken" or "the most dangerous experience" "the most expensive hotel" etc etc??? hahaha
Love you both xxx #couplegoals
I've never been skiing before (part of growing up in a desert climate), but seeing your video really makes me want to go skiing! You guys are the best, thanks for the amazing content.
You need to be gifted better chopping knives ❤️
I swear I get so happy whenever I see a new video like y’all slowly curing my depression
“Who’s Monica?” …The audacity 😂  sounds like y’all need to binge watch some friends 🤣
Happy to see you kept your mustache Nate. Excited about your winter travels and haul down the Baja coast. I’m happy with what ever you two decide to do but I was just curious do you still plan to knock all 50 states in the van? I’m loving the suspense. Whatever you do just enjoy yourselves and keep up the awesome videos.
I mean, one of the best things about skiing is going to the hot springs or hot tub after hitting the slopes so I think you’re still going to need swimsuits! Jus’ Sayin’! :)
SHAVE THE Moustache PLEASE NATE
A surprise Wednesday upload from Kara and nate made my day😍🥰💗
Funni and Too relatable 5:55
Kara mentioning Monica and then, later, saying “I KNOW!”  This!
You definitely need to get rid of your mustache it makes you look like the Frito Bandito
That is so awesome that y’all are skiing the slopes and can come back and hang in the van. You guys are great. Great video
The trick to skiing, to go skis in French fry position to stop pizza position. Remember that and you are good.
Please tell me not only my Siri was activated when Nate said "Hey Siri" lol
You guys are the best
-6F?!  I could walk in that naked right now.  It is currently -20F with the wind chill in Alberta, Canada (with an extreme weather warning).  Regardless, I still love your content!  It’s awesome!!!!!!
This morning Cara 🤣
Hi Kara!  Quick tip about your Athletic Greens.  You should drink it 30 minutes before your coffee (recommended on the site).  Caffeeine prevents absorbtion of vitamin B.  So you are not getting the best out of your AG1.  Nate is going to have to change his morning coffee cup filming routine to shaking the AG1 shaker! :)
Good to know I'm not the only one who writes things on my to do list after they're already done just to cross them off and feel more accomplished!
me: I would lose that gas cap so fast 10 seconds later nate: I'm for sure going to lose that one day.
You guys are a trip...⛷️⛷️⛷️⛷️🏂🏂🏂
I just love you two!
Yessss!!!
Anyone else smile at their phone the entire video? 😂 Kara and Nate, y’all are the best!
Ninty thousand 😆😆
I just love watching you guys.
You two certainly know how to have FUN!
YAYAYAY.   You are handsome with or with out the mustache,   But really looks like you with out!
Great to see you in the Rocky Mountain Region again.  Hopefully we run into you as you travel around Colorado.
You’re at altitude. Boiling water, or anything for that matter, takes longer or takes more power.
You guys always make me want to explore more vegan food options and I just love Nate's honesty about about vegan vs dairy cheese. P.S  Kara your crunchy ramen salad looked amazing 😍
Nate you had 55k likes within a day, if not less
Loved this video. Reminded me of the old videos. So great to see you all doing what you love!
woahhhh this is a new video! I'm here the same day of the upload for the first time ever!
The floor was a genius idea! It looks like it's feeling more comfortable each time you travel. Have you thought about an Instant Pot?  Making the soup reminds me how easy it would be. You can all fry in it, bake, yogurt. So many things.
Sorry Kara, but Nate is going to have to shave off his mustache, but nothing says he can't immediately start growing it back out. He is a man of his word so I know he'll shave it. In a couple of weeks I hope you will give us your opinions on surfing vs. Snow skiing, your honest assessment. I really hope y'all have fun this month and don't have any accidents. It would be tough recovering from something like a broken leg. Have fun in the winter sun!
Can't wait to follow this journey, love you guys ❤
Yep REI is expensive but so worth it
Good to see 3 of you in van again. Kara, Nate and Le Mustache.
Living your best life, love it. My dream…
Nate looks like British Colonizer..
The reappearance of Charlie!!!!! Missed that Aussie ruffian - hope he manages to get in a video soon!
Love the video and can't wait for more of your ski videos. Your the best. Sorry Kara but he promised and now the mustache goes bye bye. lol
The mustache would look good with a beard Nate. Just not by itself. I’m sorry!! 😅
Kara likes the stache....not even sure why you guys put it up for a vote...other than just to get a few million opinions.  I've recently learned how fun it can be to just let that facial hair go wild...and the girlfriend informed me of her opinion, which got a prompt shave...cause happy gf = happy life.  Anyways...to me, it's better to let it grow wild when older...cause it looks better, but...if Kara likes/wants it to stay...she overrules any vote I have.  Happy wife = Happy life there Nate.  Haha  You already knew that.
Okay, so my last good comment was replied to by someone I don’t trust, deleted it, looked liked spam and not edifying as sent!  Said to only view if 18 or older, seems like YouTube could block headers like that!  I want you to know how much your videos bless me, trying again!
Hey wait. Did you always have a nose ring? Don’t ask anyone in Lowe’s for help finding anything Nate. Just figure it out on your own. Ha
It sounds fantastic but please be careful in Mexico ive been there and the cartels are very dangerous please take care ❤️
I'm happy to see you guys actually winterize your van! I've seen too many other vanlifers try winter in a van for the first time and just wing it and it's bad lol.
Nate, that 'stache is epic!
Absolutely love the longer videos!! This is set up as a tv series let’s go nat geo!
You guys are living the dream! Makes me want to throw all of my stuff in storage, pack the car,  grab my dog and just GO. Also really love how supportive and proud of each other you are.
Love the crocs
Do they literally think the dirt stache looks nice?
Wooooooop finally more van videos
remove ur moustache pleaseeeee
Pretty sure Kara is using reverse psychology on you so..
Oh my gosh, the crocs bit just made my day hahaha
Love the stache!!!
Gonna go get me a watch like Nate's. " I saw Nate wearing a casio watch so I bought a casio watch" . Lol
Didn't you get enough clicks on the last video Kara? Nate still has the catapillar 🐛on his upper lip😭.
You guys are such a fun nice couple to watch, please shave the mustache you look cute without it ❤❤
DONT SHAVE!!!!!
I think you guys are awesome 🤩 and I love your videos. But, can Nate please shave the mustache? Either that or I’m going to start calling him Stephen. Or maybe Poncho? 😂
thank you for manning up and willl. shave your mustache. it is bad.
Looking forward to the 2 month road trip. Love that you both are on a health kick but are you going to be one of those channels "casually" mentions they are vegan at every opportunity? Vegan is such a dirty word. Try "plant based".
u guys r awesome
Its the moustache for me HAPPY NEW YEAR
Love this video !! So real and so much fun esp the cheese comment about forgetting what real cheese tastes like!! Thanks for posting guys!! Bring on the shave!!
After 14:00 "We gotta be productive." - Nate ...... Someone put that on a shirt.
This was such a lovely watch. I realy love how happy you two seem. Can't wait for more of this new adventure <3
If the spatula melted,  get a better/ high heat spatula! The plastic is bad since it melts that easily.  Snow looks so pretty.
I've really missed your videos! They really put me in a positive mood. Thanks and welcome back!
I know its irrational but the clothes on the stove gives me anxiety😂😫
YESSSSSSSSS NEW VIDEOOOOOO
must be nice to have travel funds
I’m so excited to see all the coming van videos!! Let’s me honest though, we all love every video you two make!
🥺 Nate...you still have something on your face🙊
That made me nervous seeing how close your curtain was to an open flame while cooking,   yikes.. haha  be safe.  Looks like fun
How about bolting the sink tank to the floor?
I think it easier if you just insulate the gray tank below the van. I love to saw Nate become more expert to fix thing mad Kara start to cooking better. looking forward Nate without moustache. hahahah
I was waiting the whole video for a flashback of Kara falling in her skis and it never played! Disappointed. 😂
Never say last run before you do it, always 2nd last at the v least! Its a skier superstition but it's important for preventing injury! Also, your skiing looks amazing, great progress!
shave the stach nate!
Impressed with kara today ❤️
I'm with you Kara! love the mustache!
Hi Kara and Nate
Wow I missed you guys- glad you’re back! I hope your break recharged you guys.
It's sooo cool to discover what view you have  when you wake up, after you get to a new place. I always take a picture with the windowframe on it. So now I have a whole collection. Pretty neat!  Love from the Netherlands 💗
From one Coloradoan to another (honorary) Coloradoan, when y'all walked into that REI and said you had no ski clothes, my eyes about popped out of my head knowing what was about to happen. I feel your pain.
This was such a cute authentic vlog I loved watching this you both looked like you were truly in your element, I love all you videos honestly but I can't wait for the journey of the people I saw in this video so natural and happy. Love it lots, plus great ideas on dealing with winter weather do you have any ideas for combating the ice accumulation on the inside of the windows? Thanks for all the videos and all the best in the New Year!! 😘🤗👏
Amazing as usual, i think that all of this pandemic BS has been a lot easier with you. Thanks from Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina.
I have those floor mats in my home gym and they are awesome. I also carved out a fit for my camper shower. Good ideas!
Haha as a German I really appreciate the conversion into Celsius ♥️ I love your videos. Also, I’m pretty sure the the new grey water tank is going to smell really bad without a siphon trap thingy  😅
If you guys pass by Yuma, AZ! I can take you guys right across the border to get the best fish in Mexico!
BLESSINGS to you BOTH ❤️💯
Why dont you guys put up some LED lights in the van
I think maybe another reason it took so long for your dinner recipe is the knife you were cutting with! 😬 😂 you guys definitely need a better knife if you’re gonna follow Eamon and Becs recipes! Nothing too expensive but something better than a serrated steak knife. Love your channel and the love you have for each other!
It was so great meeting and working with you guys!! This video is such a great addition! Hope to see you all again! God bless!
Trick for the condensation turning to ice in the van fill some socks with plain uncooked rice and place them by windows works amazing x
Every van lifer will now be installing that on their floors! Brilliant! Love you guys & can NOT WAIT TO SEE POP AGAIN! 💗 Be safe & make more beautiful memories! (I'm still having to get used to that think above your lip Nate 🤣 Giving me the Ron Burgundy vibes 🤣)
Of course I would drink the AG1 if I was getting it free too! No brainer.
I’m so excited for another video 🥰
This is the best YouTube video in 2022
Keep the mustache Nate.  At least through the winter
Love your videos. So funny. Frustrating and ling and bothersome to you, but funny for us.:-)
The fabric curtain looks so close to the stove flame.
Nate my man you gotta shave that stash man either keep a trim beard or nothing at all
YAYYY!! Shave the pornstache!😁😉 Awesome video btw! It was really fun.❄️
Wow your both Amazing on ski. Have a lot of fun enjoy your selfs . Looking forward to your next adventures 🥰 Take care 🥰
the drain in the shower goes to your grey water tank under the van.
wait i was hoodwinked I thought if they video got 50k likes you were KEEPING the mustache
Nate - Hop into Lowes, get some Velcro tape or magnet tape. Will hold the gym mats in the shower a bit better. I have a feeling they'll end up dropping quite a bit.
DO NOT CLICK YOUR SKIS TOGETHER!   My husband just watched me have a full blown panic attack in 1 second.   I moved from Tahoe, to central NM to get away from skiing, but you have convinced me to take a trip to ski taos at some point. Great job with the winterizing!
I love watching you guys, if you are ever in Northeast Ohio with the van and need a place to stay, you can always park your van in my driveway
I think putting that padding down was one of the smartest things ever! It'll definitely keep the cold out and help retain the heat. My friend runs her daycare out of her garage (more space than her living room) and she has two layers of the padding on the floor and the kids run around in bare feet. Those things are a life saver! Easier to clean too! Glad you had fun skiing!
yall are sick for making nate shave his mustache
Kara, the reason it took longer to cook wasn’t because the burner is too small, it’s because you’re at an elevation higher than sea level, so it will take longer to boil and cook anything on the stove.
Love you both. Nate, would you shave off your mustache. You look sinister.
My husband & I own/operate a small B&B in Breckenridge!! Please stop by, we’d love to have you!!! We’re a 5 min walk from the mountain!
11:50 new England memories ❤️❤️
Kara should start an Onlyfans, shes smoking
Great video! The only thing that bothers me is the curtain behind the back burner on your stove. I keep seeing a flame up at some point (is it fire proof?) but this is ten days later and I guess nothing's happened yet. You guys have fun!
I love you guys! It must be awesome skiing with no one around. I hate when the slopes are busy. It makes me so nervous.
I'm happy to meet up with you in Utah and give you any ski tips! I've been skiing almost 20 years :)
Link to floor mats thing u used? Thanks!! Headed your way in 2 weeks and doing a month in CO skiing as well.. but we are RV life 😀
1. The mustache looks fine.  2. With the Patagonia gear you bought Kara is right, that is life investment. I just had them warrantee replace a coat i had for 10 years because a zipper broke. gave me the full 350$ value for it. Upgraded to a warmer puffy for the winter. 100% always go with Patagonia for outdoor clothing.
A Charlie Sighting!  woot!
Soooo sooooo soooo underrated.. You guys should be on your diamond play button by now.. The quality of content that u guys deliver is just amazing.. Love love from India❤️
The floor looks perfect for winter van life! I love watching you two embrace the van and continue to make it what you need to travel! AND $25 per night to park in a ski town, so cool!!
"nOtHiNg LiKe A liTtLe SpAtUlA iN oUr SoUp" -nate-  best quote of the video :)
dont shave the mustasge
Wow this is just a dream! So amazing to wake up and just go skiing! So cool😍 and to easily come back to go eat when ur hungry!!! I love this
oh my goodness i've been wondering if y'all still keep in touch with charlie! does that convo mean we'll be seeing him again soon?!?! i love that the friendships yall have made during your travels are still going strong
Talking of nutrition, Kara is skin ageing rapidly. More red meat and dairy required as part of a healthy diet.
I saw the thumbnail and nate looks so different with a moustache I like it thou
Litteraly ordered AG last night using your code!
I hope u guys took a pic on ur bed with that beautiful snowy view!!😍😍
Yayyyy! Love that you guys are back at travelling! :) You guys make me so happy!
i am happy yall are back
0.33 Nate we’ve all been there
Guys! This was such a good video, excited for more road trips through the slopes :D. Nate, keep the stache!!
Amazing guys.. you guys work so hard ..love your videos
I bought magnetic diesel caps for my pickup off Amazon. So I just stick it to the door while I pump
i'm gonna miss the Nate-stache😂❤️
Why not just use some antifreeze
Good to see you guys going back to van🤩
you sould have a 360 cam for these shots. it would bring funny content. nice video
Amazing video, the energy of both of you inspires me to do more every time I watch. Have finally hooked my husband in watching with me. (he is Italian) So today's episode and Kara saying 3 cheese sandwich in very wrong Italian was very funny for us. I wish I would have filmed my husbands face when he heard it so I could send you. Was special and cute moment for us. Thank you both for what you do and making us smile.
😍😘🤩
So excited to see your video pop up on my feed!! So refreshing to see you guys I hope ur having a good day! Love u guys ❤️
It was great getting to meet y'all in Taos! Hope the rest of your ski trip goes great, I'm sure y'all will be pros by the end of the month!
Hi, i have been watching your guys video for a few years now, but have not commented before as, my life can be a mess of hectic to say the least. I just wanted to thank you, I am a tech support agent, and thus do a lot of work on computers etc. But with this job, it’s either super crazy busy, with no time to do much else, or dead as a doorknob with ample time needing something to do. Your videos are a great way to de-stress, or pass sometime while on a lunch break. I just wanted to reach out, and say thank you. Every week I get super excited for another video, never being disappointed from the content. You help sometimes make a insanely stressful day more relaxing, or a way to pass sometime till the next call or email, which to say the least makes my day always end on a happy note. Thank you guys truly being someone in Canada who (as could guess with the job) doesn’t get out much, it’s a way to watch something that is going on, while still being wrapped up in a blanket, with a cup of much needed coffee for 7am ❤️never change being you guys. I never care what the video is about as regardless it always is the best part of my day to watch it. Thank you again truly, have become part of my weekly routine ❤️❤️🙌
Please leave more of the in-between dialogue! They crack me up 😂
To be honest… the stache has grown on me. 😂🥸
You two have such a great honest dynamic, very infectious!!! We always looks forward to your videos no matter what you are doing or where you are. Thank you for such a great video, we are with you in spirit on those slopes 🎿!!
wow kara's I KNOWWWWWW was literally Monica's i knowwww
What's the altitude? Doesn't that affect boiling time?  As usual it was a great video! You actually made skiing look fun to my old bones. Smile.
You guys are awesome,you guys inspire me to do van life and am only under 13! I already started planning and watch you’re guys videos all the time!
You guys are great! I have followed you for quite a while now but I have not left a comment. I just wanted to let you know how much I enjoy your videos. You are, in a sense, the envy of the young and young at heart. I also understand why you get awards for your videos. We would all like to travel the world like you do.  I live vicariously through you. I am old and disabled now, but when I was young, I would have loved van life! I was very adventurous when I was in my 20’s and 30’s.   Many Blessings and stay safe! ☮️💟Debbie
That's really cool, I was just wondering if you guys kept in touch with charlie. I've been watching some of the old videos where you guys were together.
Such a cool video! Plus, the asmr sounds were so nice.
Omg! love that you guys put up the temperature in degrees celsius ❤️
So glad to have a 'real' Kara and Nate video, and Wednesday bonus was awesome! Have missed these type of videos where you just take us along on your life adventure. Together you two are something truly special.
I’m surprised the wall padding by the burner doesn’t catch fire. It doesn’t look safe.
Seeing them back together in the van and on road just made me smile throughout the video 🖤🥺
Get an old sick put silica cat litter and put it on the dash. It will suck moisture from the air so the windows won't freeze up
Where doess the shower drain????
What heater system do you guys use?
Watching Kara and Nate on my lunch break! I got so excited to see this posted
Nate looks like a slim Chris Bumstead. 😂😂😂
Two things: 1. Ditch the moustache. It makes you look like a college student trying to fool the bouncers. 2. The padding on the floor is a great idea. It reduces sound, too.
I feel like this is one of the best videos you two have had in awhile.  Keep it up and can't wait for the next one!😊
Just love your guys energies!! The love is so genuine between you both. — Thanks for shearing what you both have with all of us in YouTube land💯 it’s appreciated💯💪🏾
Please! LET ME KNOW WHEN YOURE IN PHOENIX. I HAVE SOME GREAT SPOTS FOR YOU GUYS
Great video I didn't want it to end
Definitely hit up Winter Park and Snowmass in Colorado. I worked as a liftie at Snowmass for five years. A great mountain with all levels of terrain. And shorter lines/cooler people than Vail.  Side note: don’t ever call last run. Most of my friends who break something, they call a last run. Always say ski two and skip the last 😊😊
Why are you filling your water tanks?  Won't they freeze too?  I just buy a few one gallon water bottles and I'm good to go.  No way I would fill my water tanks in this situation.
I love that y’all show the stuff that’s messy and doesn’t always go as planned. We have been RVing for 6 yrs and that’s how you stay excited is rolling with the expected! And I love winter videos while cozy in Florida!
My favorite part of your home-improvement adventure was the fact that "multiple trips to Lowes" just meant a brisk walk to the store... from the parking lot. :) Fun when you can take your house to the store!
I def want to know the brand and info about your jacket Kara! I’m in the market for a new one and that’s exactly what I want!
Walmart knockoff Crocs are great for the cold weather. I've shoveled snow in mine and didn't bat an eyelash! Maybe just one haha but I did chuckle because my fiance and I have matching Crocs to yours
Fun and happy video!!!!❤❤❤❤😎🏜🇺🇸🌈
I like the mustache!
My first thoughts about Baja, good thing your friends with Eamon and Becc. Lots to know before heading down there.
You guys are so much fun. and Eamon and Bec also :-)
I really appreciate that you put degrees in celcius on the screen
I hope Charlie is able to join y'all soon!
Always love your content and journey! Look forward to it every week! 👍🏻👏🏻❤️
Okay so Athletic Greens... I want to try it... but usually supplements make my insides really angry and I've wasted a lot of money.... Do they have a way to order some travel packs so I can try it for a week to see how it treats my digestive system? I think there really should be a way to do that.  Also, I'm excited that you guys are back in the van ! :)
Maybe you should get some roof racks installed and it would give you some more storage options.
You guys should do the post cards again! That's amazing!!!!
Nate..... brother I'm going to recommend growing a goatee at the very least.  Looks like it's going to be a completely different type of video with that mustache. Lol.  Love the video btw.
Lose the porn 'stash!!!!!
You need to down booties for winter vanlife. They are the best!
Kara using Monica's "I Know" 😂😂
So with the shower being a ski locker… where do you shower? Lol. 🤔
I love Taos! Such a fun mountain.
What happened to the clothes from that sponsor, did you forget to pack them?
Nate being proud of Kara while skiing was so cutee🥺🥺🥺
What happened to Nate
Their cookbook has been delicious! That sundries tomato pasta was amazing!
I love that blanket at 11:44 do you know where I can get it
Don't shave the stache! Love yall so much, you brighten my day when I watch your videos. Thank you for taking us on your journey 🤗
It's funny to see that Kate still has here store tag on her coat while skiing...  lol
❤️ Love you guys!❤️✌️
I miss skiing so much, sad I’ll never do it again
Kara,  great job! keep those knees bent and you got it! Nate, you are a great cheerleader for her, we love the encouragement, yes! Can't wait to see the surfing videos! Enjoy living THE DREAM
I love a surprise Wednesday upload! ❤
Just what I needed after a bad day as a nursing student, thanks for the video and have fun guys :)
Every ski  hill I've ever been to has a bra tree. You just need to find it! And thanks for another great video!
LOVE you guys but need to play bossy person in the comments and say that back burner next to your window covering is a big fire hazard. Flammable material is way tooooo close to that open flame!
Remember, you're also high up in the mountain so water will take longer to boil.
You guys Rock!!! Slightly concerned though about the cloth window covering behind your stove. Is it made of fire retardant material???
Ok just grow a beard please.  Love the vlog as always
Woohoo! Excited for your journey to begin. Safe travels!
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️

Nate looks like a uncle with a hot wife (bye bye moustache) 🤣👍🏻
Loose the moustache Nate. You look like the Mario Brothers video game character!
Ugh, I love yall so much :)
The flooring will also help with sound 😀👍🏻
Love you guys! Found myself grinning while watching and am so glad you’re on such a great adventure ❤️ P.S SHAVE IT.
Kara 💯 nailed it with the shower water valve! Sorry Nate!  Also, loved the short beard… not a fan of the mustache though. 😬
As a local new Mexican I love to see yall here Taos ski resort might be the best one out there love you get to visit this beautiful state!!💖💖💖
Nate has grown some mustache i was shoked
I know that feeling Nate. I too love that feeling when I get a good deal. And Kara, did you put your panties on the tree? Roflmao
Please shave that creepy moustache Nate!
Thank goodnessssssas you guys are finally back together
Nate ending the Dirty Sanchez look!  Finally!
Hey! We have the same grey water drainage set up in our van. In the cold you shouldn't have a problem with smell, however as you travel into warmer weather, if your grey water tank starts to smell since it's now inside of your van, you might want to seal that gap between the pipe and the jug opening. You can seal it by 1. purchasing a seal to screw onto the jug or 2. In a pinch you can use a sock or piece of material and wedge it up around the pipe (maybe secure with a rubber band). It should block smells from entering your van.
Why you look like Justin Bieber with those message.😁
Did Nate get a mustache
BEST  WEDNESDAY SURPRISE EVER!! <3
Thank you for sharing your adventures!!!
Amazing Vid as always! Keep mixing the pot to boil the content faster.....it really helps the heating process.... its a game changer!
Make sure you ski in Flagstaff at the Snow Bowl on the Peaks. Flag is where we live! So excited you guys are heading this way! You guys are so adorable! Enjoy :)
How are u guys the best
Seeing Nate having the confidence to start making and doing things to the van is so amazing because you can tell how he's growing and getting more comfortable in there home.
I changed my mind. I like the mustache now.
Isn't storing propane in your "home" a little dangerous?
I love the handiness and confidence Nate has now with the van. I’m so excited for this  journey you all are going on. Of course crocs are super comfortable I have a pair of cheetah print ones best thing ever
Thank you for longer videos!! 🙏🙏
Kara laughing and crying at using the word "over" in a phone call brought me immense joy. Actually, there were multiple times I got a good laugh out of Kara's quick wit!
Love this video ! You guys look like you are having so much fun !!,,
Wheres the bloopers?? Thats the staple of kara and nate!
Omg hiiiii iam your biggest fan u love your videos ahhhhhh I cant believe I can see your video and you like just posted the vedeo
Vegan cheese only taste good when you have been a vegan for so long you forgot what cheese taste like hahahahha accurate
I honestly didn’t miss the mustache, thanks for the much needed laugh on a Wednesday!
Shave the stash lol
Sorry
Woo hoo go Kara !!!
God bless you and your family
N-Stache,
-4 is nothing when i was on vacation in poland it was like -21 once whole day
Yay! I’m excited to see this new adventure! 💕
Yay! The best work day distraction! Love your videos!
Thank yall for all you do to make these videos and share with us. I love it all!!
Please Nate, get rid of that moustache 😉.Anja from Germany
God tier watch there Nate!
I love you guys you are my inspiration for life
When you get to Baja I hope you go to Cabo Pulmo. It's an amazing dive.
Thank you both for sharing your adventures with us!! The cinematography is excellent, the locations are picturesque, and your story telling abilities are captivating! Mad love from Vermont! *#karaandnate*
So I grew up skiing in New Mexico and Colorado, and one thing that changed the game for me and made fall in love with skiing was when I figured out to put the hand warmers under my toes in my socks and then put my ski boots on. Also put one in your normal jacket pockets. Lol, haven't been cold since I figured that out!
Chatting with Charlie?? Possible reunion?? I hope so!! He was so funny I loved him <3
lol my god get some proper knives before you cut yer fingies off!    Love you two!
since you converted the shower into a ski locker, where do you shower then?
My favorite moment is when Kara says “I can wear my tie dye hoodie!” And Nate replies with “that’s a crop top” 😂 b/c that’s an exchange I’ve had with my bf before!
So amazing to see you guys at the ski area where I grew up, and where I started skiing at 1 years old… Beautiful place
You all are at altitude. Water boils at a lower temp and food takes longer to cook!!!!
Bwahaha -- nate's vegan cheese comment is spot on!
New Mexico has some of the nicest people on the northern part of the state
I usually compare kara and bec of who's crazy. i think i decided to name kara the craziest😉
Kara and Nate, thank you. I enjoy so much watching you both. I look forward to all of your new adventures. Be safe. Have fun.
Ops I mean good
Love you guys. Come back to MN and ski lutsen!!
This vidio was amaizing 🤍 I Love to ski she is pretty giid
The pucker factor was high with Nate lighting the stove. Glad you got through it without moustache burn 🔥 .
Idk man. Oddly enough that sash suits you. Keep it!
Love you guys so much!!!
A dehumidifier makes all the difference, when you are living /camping in a van or camper in cold weather.
Hi nateee and kat, i really lovee u both. I just discovered u recently and i can't stop binge watching ur videooos. I lovee u both <3
Great episode! You guys need a proper knife though!
Yuppie van life started...  and Nate is going to clean his mustache.... sooo happy 😊 😃.
Shave Nate.
My husband was a vegan for 15 years…until we moved to France. The best vegan cheese we found was rice based. Wasn’t as stinky and melted well.
Full disclaimer - when listening to this (not watching) at max volume on bluetooth in the car in a snowstorm, the sound of scraping the ice off the windshield and the sound of skis down the hill might just (almost) send you off the road. Such a "what the heck!" Moment!
I found your channel two days ago by coming across a tiktok video about bunkers and I came to YT to watch more about it & found your channel! I haven’t stopped watching since then! I’m so happy you guys are posting , I love your channel and watching you guys travel 💕
Please don't shave you look cute
Skiing is so sick I love it! But haven’t been in so long! Since 2014! Wish I could go back to skiing 🥺
GO KARA!!! Love your cooking efforts! Now I really really really want to get Eamon and Bec's cookbooks! Been thinking about since they released the new one! ^_^ GO NATE! Love that you just went and did the renos yourself! ^_^
I live in New Mexico, y'all stay safe😭
Great start to an amazing new adventure!
Nate's moustache is killing me, I cannot stop laughing, go Nate! :)
57 min also so "cool"
Amarillo by Morning!!!
Omg y’all were in Amarillo!?!?
Skiing is my absolute favorite thing to do!!  Once you get really good the more fun it gets!! Investing in more ski lessons would not be a mistake!!
Cant explain why, but this video is soa wholesome
We love it when you surprise us with an extra video 😁 The enjoyment Nate gets out of a good deal is the best! 😂🙌
nate looks like mario lmaoo
Shave the mustache!!
FINALLY!!! I have spent the last couple months watching every one of your videos and said I would not watch a new one until I did! I promise I have a life. Great stuff guys!
i watch yall so much that i wanna marry kara and if i was a girl i would be wanding to marry nate
Great to see you guys in the van again!! vibes were immaculate this video, cheers
Shave it man
If anyone can rock a porn "stache" it's Nate!
No morning coffee making montage?
Kara you sounded just like Monica when Nate was hanging up the clothes in the front seat! Love the video!
CROCS ARE THE BEST THING EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Y’all just made my day uploading
You all be careful in your travels Covid is back on the rise wear your masks be safe but have fun see you in the next one ❤️❤️❤️🌈🌈🌈🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
Your videos bring an instant smile to my face! I’m living vicariously through you guys, stay awesome !
Yay fuzzy crocs !! So warm and cozy. [Side note;  it takes longer to boil water at higher elevations]
Yo, did Nate get new teeth.. I couldn't stop staring at them the whole time hahahha he looked like when Ross got his teeth whitened on that episode of Friends
I know it's kind of redundant but have you thought about getting a small enclosed pull along trailer?
gotta check out steamboat sometime this year, winter or summer you wont be dissapointed
I hate to be a safety nerd but you should not be storing a propane tank with liquid in it inside the van. The odds are slim but never got a leak out of that tank and it finds a spark very dangerous situation. You’ve probably already been told that but my 30 years in the propane business won’t let me see that and not try to warn you I hope it never happens but it’s one of those things that can be prevented. Keep traveling and having fun.
I would love that ski with you guys!!! It's very strange to ask but I would love to meet you!! This chanel has helped me through incredibly difficult times!! I love you guys!!!
i reported the fake mr beast btw
Loved this video, easily one of your best
Yay guys with *50k+ likes*
So… did the coffee pot get washed yet or is it still producing antibacterial agents? ;) lol   Skiing looks so much fun! It’s definitely on my bucket list!
Yeeeessss Crocs!!!
Nate looks like a CIA agent from the 80s with that mustache.
What apps do you use to find overnight parking. We usually use iOverlander but didn't have much luck with it the last few trips
My husband does the same thing like Nate. How he forgets when I say something sensible. 😂 #marriedlife
Love watching all your vlogs!
Wow! Ski all day and still get some work in. You inspire us all to dare to do what we love, so that work and play can be intertwined
I like how they think -6 is that cold when where I live it gets to -14
I'm concerned about your stove.  I feel you need a heat shield on the back to keep from lighting the curtain on fire...  Keep the mustache, grow beard to match...
Dang!!! You guys have to say 100k likes now for challenging us 😘❤️✌🏼🌎
but its winte for like 2 months now wth guess usa has bead seasons
So sorry Nate your Moustache needs shaving off and start again you look like someone from the 70s but if you like it no problem it wasn't a criticism a obsovation you both are brilliant xxxxx
Girl after my own heart - write something on the list so you can cross it off.
Wow, Wednesday surprise!
Last chair to the top did you never see that movie 😬🤣
Love you guys ❤️ thank you for making our days 100x better.
Excited for another video!!
My boyfriend has those crocks and he LOVES them! Lol
The best surprise as I clicked onto YT 🤩😁
Yay you posted! I love you guys Kara and Nate! Your my absolute favorite YouTubers and I love the van! Have a nice rest of your day to whoever is reading this!
I really appreciate that you take the time to provide metric conversion for the temperatures and stuff! Thank you!
Eamon: "Anyone else's fiance treat them like a six year old?" Kara: "Yes! I agree with you, Eamon!" Kara, two minutes later: "Ohhhh! I was turning the wrong knob!" Kara, two and a half minutes later: "Ohhhh! I forgot the ramen!"
Nate why don't you use antifreeze in your greywater tank
KEEP THE MUSTACHE!!!!!! 1 like on this comment = 1 vote to keep the mustache (If you already shaved it then you are legally forced by YouTube laws to grow it back)
Where are you showering?
the stache looks better than in the last video
Great energy. Keep going. I will keep watching!
You guys are the best! Truly enjoying the content you’re sharing
Cant wait to see Charlie!
Gotta be honest,  concerns me how close that open flame cooktop and those hot pots/pans are to that fabric insulation on the window.  Seems like a fire hazard.
Sending sun from Israel ☀️
Beautiful area of New mexico. I can just imagine that sticker shock walking out of rei ha
You guys Rock!!! Couldn’t click fast enough!! 😊👍⛷
Nate! I feel like you really started to own the stache this episode and it really suits you! Especially for the ski/surf bum lifestyle! Sad to see it go so soon! Also, this was a great vid guys! ❤️
Vegan cheese does bad things to my GI tract 😂😂😂
This is my favorite type of Kara and Nate video and it's only Wednesday!
For the first time, I watched one of their videos in less than 5 min from being uploaded!!!
Okay I'm gonna come back because the wife and kids will be mad I watched without them
You are super hungry cause you are eating vegan.
NOT THE MOUSTACHE
"We're going Gambling!!!"  ha!!!  Perfect timing.
Liquids take longer to heat depending on your altitude.
Love Nate reminding himself how to ski😂
I really want a van now.  I have come to realize that total freedom and avoiding the crowds is what I want.  It is to hard to get campgrounds now or find a place to park in the city with an RV or trailer!  Keep up the awesome videos 😀
Great video!!
Thanks for the upload! Great episode!  I just watched one of your older videos and I was wondering if you had ever considered to plan again for the Pacific coast road trip you had to cancel at the end of 2021? I think you are going to Mexico next, you could take the Pacific road coast from South to North and even push to Alaska through Canada if the weather and COVID situation allow it… Just a thought… Your channel is one of my favourites! 💕🎉😃
có ngôi nhà di động ntn tuyệt vời quá ạ
Oh I love you both so much!!! Have fun and I cannot wait to see your next adventures!!!
Also so happy to be watching a mid-week bonus episode! We’ve been craving snow lately here in Turkey so living vicariously through your ski ⛷ trip!
With the stache Nate looks even more like Dusty
So nice to have you back!!!!
wow😍❤️ finally new video after a long time I waite
Wait, I thought Nate was going to shave the mustache …😄😄
Hello guys love you guys so much really gave me the courage to live in a small or big house love you guys❤️❤️❤️
Why not just carry a gallon or 2 of  antifreeze for gray water.
That was a great way to spend my break! Can't wait to see what happens next!
Nate just get loose of that moustache
Are you going to meetup with #mrandmrsadventure when you're in baja?
Nate looks like anchorman when he all bundled up with his ski gear 😂 with the turtleneck and helmet and goggles on
Firstly nate cool moe ... really enjoyed this video . Learning how to edit video using this video ... nate kara thanks
I can’t believe you guys came to Albuquerque New Mexico and you didn’t even do a meet and greet or say hello 🥺✌🏼❤️🌎
Hi guys I love you
keep the mustache!!!
They have these heating mats that go on RV water tanks for winter boondocking to keep your tanks from freezibg. You should get one!
Ngl i  been binge watching you guys for the last week or so and every video you guys always drink coffee so i  had a thought if you guys can do a week of no caffeine to see how bad it affect you guys
Good job getting your ski legs back! Well done!
I've just started learning to ski too so this was extra fun to watch! Loved this episode!
did u bring the massage gun with u ? u have one of those right?
Ok.  Had to comment again lol.  Tara writing something on the list so she can make it off is sooooooo me!! Lol.  Also love the floor idea.  Best part it’s not permanent and when it’s not ski season you could just take them out and store them until next time!!  BRILLIANT GUYS!!!!
Just when I thought Nate couldn't get any more handsome...add the ski goggles with that mustache!!!?! Keep it Nate, it suits you! <3
h                                                                                                                                                                 i
Time to pull out your sun reflector on your front windshield to help insulate during the night! Love you guys!
Surprise video this morning! Yay!
Its not the burner. Boiling water at higher altitude sucks!
Noooooo the mustache looks so good
love your van life episodes!  one small suggestion...always park your van front out.  give yourself a clear drive out ability no matter where you park.  ive lived in a van/rv for 8 years and it is just a good idea for safety.  can't wait to see your adventure, especially the mexico section!
I was meant to be going sking on Saturday but my sister has just tested positive
If you aren't using the shower why did you cut around the faucet.... asking for a friend....
Wow surprise Wednesday's episode. Was not expecting that!  Thank you to Kara and Nate for making my 2nd day of my last semester of college more bearable!! :)
Wednesday is my new favorite day! ❤️ Can’t wait for the new adventures of 2022!!
Awwww…so good to hear Charlie again! Over. 🤣
You guys are still so tan from Mexico!!
Not sure how you would fit this into the van, but it would be great for printing replacement parts, hinges, and that kinda thing. Especially if nate becomes more handy, Id get a 3D Printer. The Prusa Mini is a great pick and its pretty small. You two could literally 3d print replacement parts for the van.
Finally an upload
I love you guys, I’ve missed you!!!  Keep making videos, doesn’t matter what “type” of content, you guys got it!!
You should come to Hayward Wisconsin ,at the end of February and ski the American Birkebeiner ski race!!
****PLEASE do a video describing your gear. I’d love to know which type of suitcase y’all prefer. What has held up best for you?
why does nate have a mustache??😂😂
As much as I have a disdain for snow these days, Taos actually looks beautiful.
Love ur vids so much! Don’t love his mustache so much tho hahah
I love skiing
Windshield Tip: use RainX outside and inside, no fog, or frost
Visit Ruidoso NM
Don’t shave please 🥺
Not to be a naysayer - but am wondering if damp between the new floor and the boards below will end up creating mold and mildew? I think you can purchase a kind of webbing to lay in between for some airflow/ ability to dry out trapped moisture? Or maybe there are enough ridges in the material for there to be little air pockets anyhow?
Kara eating blueberries with a bicycle helmet sitting in a complette mess describes my mental status in 2021.
yay i want to live like that
i dont like the beerd for your look
Eamon: "Does anyone else's fiancé treat them like a 6 year old?" Nate: Forces Kara to be "productive".  😂😂😂 The way that was so much funnier than it should have been lol
So when are yall gonna join La Vagabonde like Eamon and Bec?
Yessss!!!! Love u guys! So happy you'll be skiing in CO soon!!!
I felt the large REI bill from the Patagonia stuff in my soul.
Yes!!!!! Love you guys so much! Always such great content♥ Love the longer video so much guys:)
Hey Kara and Nate. You both are in the cold weather that we decided to avoid. We were in Alburquerque, NM heading to AZ when we figured it was going to be too cold for our campers. We changed our plans and headed south to Las Cruces and then west from that point. We have to say that making that decision brought us to some amazing adventures. Videos to follow.  Stay warm! ;)
Lol y’all really slept with all that stuff on you 🤣 when you’re so tired u don’t care! Also what’s with the panty tree lol we need that story
I just turned my tv on and Apple TV.  Got a notification that you guys had a new video!!!   So happy.  Just what I needed this morning.  Got my coffee all ready.
Hi
Nate love the mustache.
Can’t wait for you to hit the road again.  Thanks for the update.😎
YAY THEY POSTED GEGEBEGGEGSNBE
What is up with the mustache? Yikes.
As a brit I find Fahrenheit such a confusing measurement. 🤣
Have you every thought of making shorts because that wound be cool to short but of you life or do you already done them
yessss i’m so excited to follow along on this new ski adventure! so pumped for you guys!
13:05 - Just Kara absolutely destroying Nate who's falling a sleep 🤣 I love every video including the van, man. It's a dream of mine to travel around Europe like this 🌏
You know guys, it's time you both start acting and living like adults and not teenagers. Lol. That mess would drive me nuts. You guys can do it!!! You're both off to a great start. Lol. Safe travels.
I have never been this early!! Love ya Kara and Nate you inspire me so much to travel!!
Lol. I thought I was the only person to do something and then go add it to the list just so I can mark it off.
I AM DYING WHEN NATE WAS LIKE “AND THIS IS HOME FOR TONIGHT” AND THEN KARA PROCEEDED TO SAY “ WERE GOING GAMBLING!!!!!”
Nate still rocking the Porn-stash 😎
I feel too early 😍
I hope YouTube sends you all the money and the algorithm works in your favor
I almost didn't recognize nate again with that mustache
Loved watching that eamon and bec scene again 😂😂😂  Obsessed with y’all’s friendship!!
i am here for nates mustache😂
Kara and nate DIY channel coming soon?  Lets colab! Lol great video guys!
Love Nate’s mustache!! Have fun on your trip!
Come on over to Utah and we can ski the "greatest snow on earth" (our state motto)
Hi l love you
I can’t wait to watch this, in quarantine and this made my day😄
Yay!!
Recently I’ve been watching a bunch of Kara and Nate’s old videos..! Excited for another video to watch!
I have spent the last 2 weeks researching vans to rent for a 2 week road trip. But also to buy. You both are truly an inspiration!
I live Tucson Arizona  you guys are more than welcome to come and stop by for a home cooked meal
I’m so excited for a new video today!  Can’t wait to see your next adventure.  I wanted to ask about Charlie and your friends Julianne and Jordan — I miss your adventures with them!  I hope they are all doing well.  😊
Yay I am super early! Travel safe y’all.
Good luck in the cold weather ❤️❤️❤️
Oooooooh new video nice!
LOVE YOU BOTHHHH!!! I’m hoping to live in a van when I’m older, you guys really inspired me. Hope you’re both well! Love from the UK x
If it's grey water. Why not just add a bit on pet friendly anti-freeze to it? I added the pet friendly cause I think its environmentally safe so you could still dump it anywhere. Some one info me lol?
I love you guys but that mustache reminds me of a 70s porn star or a guy with "free candy" on the side of a white construction van
The Lowes' people would have helped you. Also near there is a travel trailer place near you that would have had everything you would need for any conversion.
Idk what to say but good content kara and nate
IM SO EXCITED !! saw this on ur instagram 💕
“remember who’s idea this was” 👀👀
Nate looks so good with his mustache! Lucky Kara 🥰🥰🥰🥰
I'm so excited for this adventure, but how cold is it? :/ it's 2 degree celsius to us already can't imagine how cold is it to you <3
I can’t wait until you guys start visiting many counties again! I was subscribed pre pandemic and watched almost all your pre pandemic videos. I’m not a van life follower but I’ll keep a look out for your next foreign travel adventure
Great to see you guys back in the van! But when are you going to do a California state road trip?!
Mustache? But you almost hit 100k likes and "only" 10k comments. We need a clean Nate!!! finally got to the end of the video and YAY... Clean shaved Nate next week, can't wait.
Yaay I’m in the first 8min
Surprise bonus episode on a Wednesday?! Heck yea, love you guys! Y’all are the best, thank you for all you do ❤️
Back on the road to new adventures!
Am still catching up with watching your older videos.  Have been binge watching from the beginning and am at #577(?), finished the Nomad games and you left for TX.  Just love watching you two! You really make my day!!! Love you guys and your loving interactions with each other❣‼
That _moustache_ will definitely take some time getting used to ...but oh man am I curious about how it's gonna be by the end of the year lol
D
So excited to see where you are off to next.  Sad it’s not by air travel, but we get it and will remain patient.
You guys are the reason for my obsession of watching van life videos. Love your work!!!

Awesome, love you guys, and so glad for another vid.
You just made my week posting today 💗
Let me tell you about the real Kara and Nate. My mother was a big fan of travel vlogs, and she died last month. I thanked  all of her favorites for entertaining her. The only one to reply with kind words were these two, despite being the most popular that I reached out to. They are the real deal.
Notification squad!!!
Yes I love when you do van life?
