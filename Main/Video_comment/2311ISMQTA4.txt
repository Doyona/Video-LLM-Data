I want clombo back so bad :( if epic doesn’t bring him back ima just cry 😢
So what your saying is people are to sensitive and need to get a hold of their life
Tbh I kinda like bows
Nobody’s talking about ufo
How did you do that
I hate some people
aint no way this list is wack
4:18 lmao
No Build mode was the best feature ever made on fortnite. It’s what got me to play.
No Build mode was the best feature ever made on fortnite. It’s what got me to play.
I personally loved the bows
Pump was removed in season 9 not X for clarification
The primal shot gun is not over powered, people are just bad
I only died to a BRUTE once it’s not overpowered
LMG IS GOOD
Everything you said was over powered, you were wrong people are just babies and quit the game cause they die once
My friend’s got a 100 Bomber in Fortnite mares
The mini gun was soo cool
For me, season 7 was the 2nd best season (first for me is season 4, the thanos event :) )
4:20 we aren’t going to talk about it.
I like the drum gun 😠😡
They replace the infinity blade with a light saber from Darth Vader 💀💀💀💀
I did
These are some long comments💀
“Way wOrse than miniguns”
Dis like
Be quiet
I loved the infinity blade but it’s only fun if you have it
I cried when I heard the pump was gone
I loved the bows wish they would come back again.
Actually the first ever op gun in fortnite was the zaptron
Skins don't matter:/
I mean other compliants are  reasonable but the compliants about weapons mean ur a wusy  or trash it your fault for dying to it or not looting for it lol.
If anyone wants to join my fortnite clan, watch my latest video!
Hi
By the end of season 2 tanks would have missiles coming down in them cuz of the mech 😳
everything else I'm fine with cuz I'm bad but klombo being removed is when they cross the line
tank wer trash i  hade a jet pack a io killed me youes en the jet pach
What if the mech could ride klombo that had guns and turrets like that.
nice :)
slurpy swamp was goated and season7 was one of my favorite seasons
We dont know why everyone hate the season even our love youtuber they jusr ask idiot  Then if fortnite see this they are done this game should be now not allowed is now deleter for 2 years should be
Tbh I loved season 7
Just like come onnnnnn Fortnite
…
And the people Who delete the game they just have anger issues
I love all of those none of those items were a mistake people like them and if u Remove items that people love then they will delete the game and ur a mistake.
Yea well guess what I miss the infinity blade
fortnite since chap 2 is the biggest mistake this game is so dogshit compared to post chap 2
i loved the fortnitemares so idk the problem with that
Becousse of you bancily i know much more about fortnite and ur video's are AMASING
Congrats on 500k!!!👏👏👏
Also releasing no builds fortnite was pretty much pub g
Ok. If you are reading this, sub to vs Mobile. He puts in a sh*t ton of effort for barley any supportt.
Why is everyone crying that STUPID KLOMBO IS GONE what about the scar the pump or just anything from old fortnite but no ohh klombo is gone SO WHO CARES
we have had the drum shotgun for two full seasons dont complain it couldve been in every season
No it is dead look a the scull in the sowny I miss him
Planes were glass cannons, they had like no hp, just some decent stuff and easy plane claps
Bows are good… 😐😑😐
Some of these are things that people actually hated and I’m pretty sure the other half of the list is just things that you put on because you don’t like the weapons cause you get beat by them every time you join a match….
Nah, new shottys suck a$$
Even though they rereleased the skull trooper it was still kind of og sense it was still chapter 1 and there wasn’t as many people playing then
Fortnite with out building is just "Nite" Because there's NO FORT AND THE FORT IN BUILDING!
Bruh
Fornite doesn’t care about anything about what the community thanks really
I honestly loved fortnitemares.
I really appreciate this video
I hated the drum shotguns so much because all of the noobs just got free spam kills and it was so annoying
I don't know why so many people just hate the weapons fortnite wanted to try something new
Otherwise somebody people have you had at weapons at fortnite just wanted to try something new
Don't judge but I like the drum shotgun
WAIT WAIT WHY DID THEY ALWAYS RESET CROWN WINS??
So basically this is a bunch of babies who want every gun nerfed to 1 damage
I feel like I'm the only person who owns the mako glider and that's kinda sad
Does that mean skull trooper isn’t coming out or am I dumb
How do you do
I wonder if the infiaty blade cloud kill klombo
Recon expert has a black variant
he spoke to soon about the LMG
Tfue: fortnite no building is fun! Me: Do you mean Nite?
2:09 the hell you talking about removing building was one the best decisions Fortnite made, only assholes that live off building hated it because without there precious building they suck
I don’t even know how much seasons I’ve skipped I think MAYBE and chapter and 5 seasons. I know very random but I just wanted to bring it out.
Even if I play a normal gamemode I will always never build
I saw a guy die of fall damage when she removed building
No build sucked at the start but now only noobs play lol
No one even f*****g cares about Fortnite anymore
ITS NOT FORTNITE ITS EPIC THAT MADE THE BIGGEST MISTAKE 😡
I loved season 7
Don’t bully klimbo
i do miss the bows
.
Not dead hybernating
Hi
I like how half of these complaints actually came from twitter, what most people think is the most toxic app ever, and mainly for arguments
Kilo can not go that deep in just a few days after the new season so he is still alive maybe he is dead but we don’t know
7:38 bought the mako at that time 😎
I hope account merging returns
I like how he says fortnite vaulted the mounted turret yet when we have different versions of them on the map but stationary lol also mounted turrents are the best
Nigga
Klombo's hibernating, he's on the map.
Rose's are red violets are blue I got clickbaited and so did you
No buildings was explained in story tho so it made sense
Season 7 was great loved the dogfighting in the air me n ny girl played she wants planes back
I subed I long time ago
Which sound/song did he use here? 0:10 Like from the start
U
Him : ‘glad LMG doesn’t come out, it’s worse than miniguns’ 😌 Epic : ‘ heheheh boy let’s unvault them on Thursday or next Tuesday 😈😈
This is soo cool
I LIKED BOWS
l
Hi
No, I love no building.
I remember the days when I got my hands on the infinity blade
In the start of this season some of my friends quit because their secret weapon was building
red knight is back again
I hate Colombo
I was really mad when fortnite added back breezy emote for that one week before I had it when it was released and I was upset when they added back meaning it was less rare
"i don't think that there's a single person who liked the sword" Tell that to SSundee's 8 million viewers who liked his videos.
m.
When the views are 969,969
I started in last season In the battle pass I didn't get The spider-man! 😭
and he isnt in danger or dead, he is just fine.
im waiting for scar and pump epic
wait the star wound is in the item shop tho
If they killed klombo tilted will be destroyed
👋 hello
7:34 the GALAXY SKIN HOWW
Klombo is again sleeping in the snow
NAHHH I'M GUILTY OF THE SLURPY SWAMP ONE 🫣
You can never make a whole community happy
all the items are coming back
Do a video about the fresh aura skin
To be fair them resetting crown wins was kind of good because of them toxic people
🥲🥲😂😂😂
600
God's love is like one of those tank shells exploding ah haha ah haha no back at you!
That cannot be klombo  because the skull looks to small
i disagree with everything in this video, but especially fortnitemares. Fortnitemares is something added every halloween to celebrate it in the videogame, and it is ALWAYS fun. It is also always something new every year, which adds to the reason its enjoyable.
Click bait but ye
Clickbaiter
aaaah
FORTNITE WHY KLOMBO WHY
He's using top 5 gaming's videos he just put them all together and started talking over him
Pump has been removed because the community if the community didn’t use double pump, pump would still be in game
Hi my fortnite name is Clayman571 can you please add me?
The stupid Fortnite community just hates everythings thats funny and cool. What funny items are in the game right now. Right none.
Ya pumps are good but combat shot gun is extremely fun
Pin this I dare you
Kolombo is alive
Yo
I just noticed the infinity blade does as much damage as a harpoon gun 😂😂😂😂😂😂
That Can bea monster grom event 0:37
If you go in the zero point you’re skin will go in the item shop a day after my skin was bronto
The biggest mistake they ever made: creating the game
bro i didnt play fortnite for 1 or 2 year what the f%ck happen to the gamee
I love your videos they're cool
klmbo isnt dead thats the monster
dragon breath was awesome I carried two and never used it at close range
I'd love to combine my two accounts and still have my crown wins building they could have just added no crown variants or just have it keep upgrading every season a new style or somthing
klombo is coming back as an armoured battle beast the saddle will let you control it im guessing tanks are awesome if you cant take out a tank you are dog water if you cant use them let a pro drive builds or no builds ill destroy you with a tank or grenades
They need to remove the drum shotgun asap, shits broken as fuck and everyone knows it 😒
I think drum shotguns should stay
Tanks are to overpowerd
The gold snipers do 198 dm and not one shot
that's true that klobo is coming back
Mechs were too op!
If og renagade raider camecback
This is very sad but did I ask?
i remeber everything in this video and people use to go invisible in playground and i killed the invisible person
He is my favorite youtuber
It was slogo
Fornite battlepass I just shit put my ass loading up the pc cuz I need it fortnite battle pass
I really don’t like the tanks and I hope they actually do bring the pump back
I don’t like the tanks that much
your just complaining about nothing these aren't issues
Stop giveing Fortnite so much hate
the one about the no building is stupid because the nerds who have absolutely no life and sit at their desk and play fortnite 24/7 need building because their aim is shit and they don’t want to see people being better than them. they honestly have no say because the majority of them aren’t ogs (i started in season 2, so i know a lot about this game) and have only started playing sense building was a main priority. it’s almost like a drug for them and they’re addicted to the sound of their controller or keyboard sounding like an earthquake when making a simple 1x1
Why did the screen go black when he talks about the primal shotgun
Klombo is locked in the  io vault
They chute removed the jet pack cuz it way to op
They probably intended the plane to counter the infinity sword
season 7  was the reason i join fn
6:54 Yooo that’s my clip! No way
How does he not have one million subs
I spotted doge the dog his owner is vitamin  doge is funny man and i saw a real life roblox dog doge i am ultra lucky
i was mad that combat shotgun got nerfed bc i hated it before and now i love it bc it got nerfed even though everybody hated it alrdy
I have seen you since 10k subs bro
A lot of these “mistakes” were just changing the game to have fun
I don't understand why people were mad when the skull trooper re released, since even though it was rare it still was an item shop skin and item shop skins are ment to be cycled in and out of the shop no matter how long its been gone for.
When u showed the starwand it showed my friend code padaw8n
I still have the fortnite twitch prime stuff from season 3 even the emotes and stuff lol
The combat was introduced in season 9, you made a little mistake but I don’t think anyone really cares
ONLY 9K LIKES AND 15K DISLIKES??!?!?!?!?!
This is cap
klombo is not died
This guy is a nerd he doesn’t like any of the fun stuff
Click bait if I’ve ever seen it. Lol
I have the original Renegade Raider from season 1 the season shop skin that makes squeakers go crazy whenever they see someone use them but I do know it's never coming back but at the off-chance that it does I would be perfectly fine with it because that means that new and old players will have the opportunity to enjoy and have fun with it and it will give Fortnight more profits which then they can make the game better make better events anime better fortnite skins and have more money to hire lawyers as in case of some guy tries to sue them again and we also have to remember this is whose game again that's right Donald mustards and he pretty much has the right to re-release anyting and we all to mately would have to deal with it so again I do have the Renegade Raider I'm hoping that doesn't come out but at the same time I I would be okay with it you know whatever but what am I going to do harass them on Twitter
We can all agree that he never disappoints us with his content💝❤❤cs
one sweaty skin just got in the item shop its from season 1
They should keep tanks but put less in the map or move their locations around so players dont know where they will always be
0:38 I got that loading screen a few days ago. Never knew that could be a klombo skeleton
I think that the seven was over exaggerating with klombo the were pretty much slaving him from klombo berries to klombo wich gave us loot so what if we're the ones that are being bad to klombo
I guess the infinity blade was disgusting but the tanks are not a problem😐😐😐😐😐
Yeah klombo and crowns uuhhhgggg I’m still sad for klombo🥺😭😭😭😭😭😭🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺😩 epic I leave the game if you don’t put klombo
I liked fortnite but it got bad so I stoped fortnite
I love The drum gun
my brother said that building will be gone til next season?     dont call him dumb or ill steal ur robux
Glad I never played this game
And plus you were are the mistake no one else but you no one cares
Island originals
Hey stop clickbaiting
UFO’s were also pretty annoying
sounds like they know how to keep the game fun and changing rather than make a stale game with no crazy and fun weapons. game would be dead if they never had op weapons sometimes or crazy fun things to do. also no building was the best thing they ever did for the game. its more popular now than its ever been
HOW THE FUCK IS THE ZERO POINT A MISTAKE BITCH TELL ME
basically whenever Epic changes something in fortnite someone is butthurt. It's a progressive game. Only thing that really ruins it are the sweats.
Plus me LG's coming back this ism
I don't understand why people were mad when the skull trooper re released, since even though it was rare it still was an item shop skin and item shop skins are ment to be cycled in and out of the shop no matter how long its been gone for.
The thumbnails now 💀
Renegade raider didn’t not come back 😂😂
The one about the bows being added I kind of like the bows because of their like wide range of like purposes by preferred or snipers especially into a dotted sniper cause I just played fortnite recently and the new exotic snipers op because like you can shoot a coin or out at sniper bullet speed and you'll be able to snipe somebody from when you cross the map with a coin it's like having hacks I mean hacks and if II don't know if it's actually in the batte royale but you're creative and seriously a super cool but also I suggest people to play fortnite and check out the stuff and creative cause it's pretty hard to get it in normal mode but the angel rocket launcher is pretty cool in the new season
Food fight* auto correct strikes again
Do you all remember having the mounted turrets in GOOD FIGHT!!!
the only mistake here is you for adding the LMG on this list because it was higher than uncommon so it was harder to find
I love how most of these "bad" ideas are just the community whining about stupid shit. Like don't get me wrong game breaking glitches is one thing but come on like most of these are just people whining about a harmless weapon because they're bad which I find funny. Like I can also agree with things like removing a whole type of weapon ie Snipers. Like how is the drum shotgun bad? Not all shotguns are pumps in real life so I know Epic would have to add new things to spice the game up, just because a small group of people don't like it doesn't mean it's bad. Some want to know why it's so powerful in a close quarters situation, BECAUSE IT'S A SHOTGUN XD. For real though this was a great video and I'll be sure to check out more, I just wanted to put my two sense into this as I think the community bitches about stupid shit all the time when it comes to this game. I could write a whole novel about the things the community bitches about that is not worth the stress and they should suck it up, like NInja for example who most likely whines about so much in this game and Epic probably would have to listen since he's the biggest content creator for this game and the thought of losing him and all the money he draws in could give the CEO of Epic a heart attack.
I loved season 7 chapter 1 it had alot of fun updates also if you hate a weapon don't use it
no tank good
I think it was a bad idea to remover building because now, If you aren't very good at the game but you still want building, You will be absolutely destroyed by pro builders and it's insane, when it comes to before they removed it, Since there was only one option, Building would be for others good and bad at building there so you get a mix of both, But, I have to say that lots of people are happy and I won't hate very much on it because of the fact that it can help but still ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
This is only trending because of the click bait thumbnail
1 mistake: existing
Bancily sorry
If you didn't notice banilcy said infinite blade not infinity blade
lmao these "pros" mad at no building are the same ones that trash at aiming but godly at building. Zero build gives the game a better playstyle. You have to aim and give better positioning
Dude was called the infinity blade not the infinite blade
Im honestly impressed by the time and effort you put into these videos, keep it up! 🚀🚀
Actually no one really hated Mini guns people loved it also the crown wins was said to be because glitches and it was said to be buggy said from testers and some people weren’t even mad most of these are wrong
How’s building a mistake it’s something to help us get better as much sweats and stuff use builds so now we can focus on other things it’s very helpful!!
Tanks aren’t too op in no build there’s many ways to damage them
And84
AC/DC also hit56
people complaining about them rereleasing “og” skins have no real problems in their life lol
Tanks are easy asf to take out what do you mean lmao? They’ve literally given us the tools to take out vehicles easily.
this is just a video of a guy bitching about minor inconveniences
I like infinity sword
Building is coming back
I Like the tanks. I don't know why people hate it so much.
i subbed
Pump vaulted in season 9
44Trending
NOOOOOOOOOO WAY I THOUGHT TN WAS REAL!!!
Really crown wins reset at the start of a season oh no  big mistake to set every season apart.   Also complaining about weapons people enjoyed and calling them mistakes this channel is a joke thumbs down never watch again
He’s not gone dumbey
Most of your "mistakes". Are just changes you seem to not like so you put it in as s mistake
fortnite fans keep making excuses like bro just play the game :/
You know, I might've been the only person to trick shot in c2 s6 cuz I once hit a guy mid air and the bow wasn't even fully charged
I wish account merging came back as I didn’t know my switch account as that has some of my favourite items on although my ps account is of but the switch has season 5&6 so I hope it comes back one day 🤞
I love the turret
Hi love your vids im 9 but love your vids
00PSSS...
cap
I know I feel like the clubhouse did for now in fortnite season 1 I hate fortnite season 1
I love her to get Rider
Boys in fortnite I killed somebody with a pistol
I want scorcher I miss web shooters in the Columbus 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
The kitten I play fortnite 2
The reason they took account merging is because so people wouldn’t buy og accounts and merg them to their main
Sometimes Fortnite is the best and the worst that is why sometimes I'm a sweat and sometimes I take a 3-month break anyone agree
No company is perfect and mistakes are very common in every game as the owners are human.
mans just saying pretty much everything is fortnite a mistake XD
og skull and ghoul trooper as the dumbest thing epic had ever done
honestly why complain about tanks in no build just dont play no build then
Also look at the description of the crown win emote
I like the turrets and the Infinity blade because it it was a good cause to help us win and games
bringing back the og skins are not a mistake. It prevents people from buying accounts which is not allowed
You can see klombo hibernating in the snow biom
hes not dead there are new snow piles with klombos hidden around the map.
Fortnite: adds tanks in no building Fortnite players: bruh nah I will delete the game Meanwhile Cod players: destroying over 5  tanks with just grenades
Wait
Fake
I loved the infinity blade for a reason I could get revenge on those toxic players or sweats who never sleep It was the only thing I liked about it but the game mode was even better because everyone would be on hoverboards with it and it brought the idea of people doing weird fights like backflip into a slam to kill
Once when I was playing the pit with my friends I hit an insane trickshot with the grappler bow so my friend was mid air and I shot the bow trying to grapple then I hit a headshot
It’s fake bro I saw the shop
On the first one people get mad over a pixel
in my opinion, tanks are easy to kill, it just takes a heavy sniper and a good hiding spot
Klombo didnt die because tilted towers is still here and not destroyed
I love drumguns
True something where over powered but think about it without epic games there will be no fortnite I just started to accept the fact there id always a way to avoid and learn no is perfect but it’s okay
What about ufo
this was posted on my birthdayyy
Is a mistake
Fortnite
Klombos are hibernating not dead
The IO capture Klombo
Chapter 2 Season 6 Primal Chapter 3 Season 0 Primal  Chapter 2 Season 7 Invasion  Chapter 3 Season 1 Klombo is Hibernating  Chapter 2 Season 8 Cubed Chapter 3 Season 2 Klombo is Extinct Kinda
I subscribed and liked and turned notifications on I want to open Fortnite with gifts pls Can someone gift me battle pass or skin. Or emote on Fortnite I got nothing my IGN is : Average Bomber
gosh YOU ALREADY DID A VIDEO ABOUT KLOMBO THAT SHOWS THAT KLOMBOS ARE NOT DEAD YOU ABSOLUTE FOOL
Wtf they re released mako? I didn’t play all chapter 2 but now I play again in season 3 and all I run is mako we’re people able to buy it and if they did was it removed from they account?
i loved season 7 because the battle pass and map but the planes where so bad
The brut is y my brother quit Fortnite and is now about to quit again because of the tank
Omni sword is broken because it hits twice and other puck axes hit once.
(Username: WheelieJack) if you gave me literally anything I wouldn’t care I just want a item lol
I hope epic sees this
I personally think that season 7 season was the best bc they added many things and I had the most fun
I don't understand why people were mad when the skull trooper re released, since even though it was rare it still was an item shop skin and item shop skins are ment to be cycled in and out of the shop no matter how long its been gone for.
I think there might be a Fortnite World Cup in 2023
Bancily why do u click bate
I love the tanks but give them 1500 hp
IO didn't kill Klombo, they're hibernating while the war is going on, you know, for safety.
This was in a asmr search, wtf
That’s a lie abt season 7 chapter 1. It’s actually one of the best seasons to ever exist in Fortnite. The only reason people didn’t like it was bc of the planes, infinity blade, and broken zip lines. But overall it’s a good season. I mean I’d rather have that forever that have what we have now.
everyone likes the combat shotgun
Cap the youtubers post are not saying they want building back it said they wanted a no building mode so man does post that u show are damn caps sypherPK show all of their post and in does post that u show are not even true they wanted a no building mode so people who dont like building go to zero build i like both i play more Arena and building mode but still it was cool giving us that warzone or call of duty hype i do love the mo building mode everything has to depends on ur aim building just gives u another day to live in battle royal
Fun fact: kolombo dint die
If you hate building that much just play warzone
I regularly visit buffets in different cities around the states. Before I go to a buffet, I will place 6 corndogs in my jacket pockets. After entering the buffet, I sneak the corndogs into some of the fried food section trays. It is such a joy for me to see other customers of the buffet eat my corndogs thinking they were part of the bufffffff
The fact that he called Lazar beam a pro is just funny
2:22 season 9 not season x
in my opinion charge shotgun was the best shotgun in ther game
Ya
Knew u we’re gonna do brutes at the end
BRUTES ARE BACK!?!?!?!?
Boo
Lol my favourite season in this game is chapter 7
SOMEONE KILLED ME WITH A LMG AND I DIDNT KNOW WHAT IT WAS
klomo is either hiding or hibernating
I miss old bancily the old music the old transitions the skin, pickaxe, and sweaty cosmetic videos where the best it was just such a good relaxing vibe it was my favorite channel now the songs are just meh the transitions are used by like every fortnite channel and the videos are just rip-offs of top five gaming no hate intended I just thought I'd give my opinion
When bows got added I shot the like bomb bow or something hit a guy while he was driving and of course extra damage with when it blows up so I don’t think it was to bad to trick shot with
I’m actually happy about the crown win removal, because you can actually see your progress and not have to be like “huh so i had — last season… subtract this and that-“ and you don’t have to worry about seeing a sweat with 72,910 crown wins.
Klombo is actually still alive I think there’s many klombos since there were klombo all over the map. If you go to a hole where klombo was he is hibernating
4:18 Voicecrack.
Did u know that if u went under the zero point as u where getting out of the battle bus it gave u shield and it just makes you go down there faster and get like 2-4 kills
Why does this look like a tg5 video...
Click-bait
I have the mako, i had no idea they accidentally re released it.damn
"the minigun is the first overpowered weapon they added"    *bro wait till he hears about the zapatron*
Some of these mistakes were just people finding glitches. Why couldn’t epic games just fix the glitches
The biggest mistake fortnite made was existing.
I’ve figured it out  The IO is trying to ruin fortnite in order to take pressure off of the Zero Point so that it doesn’t overload from processing power
Tanks are just mechs
It only counts wins in that season
I don’t actually care about any other skins right now because it seem likes I’m the only one who noticed fortnite made lara croft a big fat ugly boob job 😐 I hate it now I refuse to wear it anymore 😏😔
100th comment
Yeaaa klombo came back yo so we good  We don’t have to kill tilted towers
tbh i really liked season 7
Reacting to Players Eliminating me In Fortnite...
I just want everyone to know that klombo isnt dead, or even captured. They are all hibernating. Go go the area between lumberyard and the seven outpost, and you may spot a familiar sight: a klombo under the snow. There are 3 in total near the area, and finding all of them is not too hard, and will give you XP. So dont worry, klombo will hopefully return, and he isnt in danger or dead, he is just fine.
I always hated Klombo He gave me the worst weapons and always ate something I wanted to pick up
Poeple complain too much.
Season 7 is one of the best seasons
Tanks ain’t bad and season 7 was one of the best BECAUSE of the planes and infinity blade
Did he say they removed the pump in season x and replaced it with the combat instead of saying season 9
You should def do a poll and see which one people prefer more; the tank or the plane
Fake
why do people like klombo so much hes not that cool
Calombo not dead Fortnite tweeted they would remove tilted if he died
Everyone needs to get over themselves and be grateful for the fact that we have a great game that is not only getting awesome updates on a weekly basis but hasn't shut it's servers down and ran with the money, they could've made Fortnite 2, make it the same game and closed all the servers and make us redo everything,  you know like call of duty does, I guess at least they keep their servers up but remaking the same game or going worse with it Is something epic could've done a year or two ago
We have mounted battle buses now
Did bro say infinite blade it's clearly Infinity Blade
2:05 I love how he says "Becuse pros are making tweets about how dum it is" And damn lazarbeam is there! Lazarbeam pro fortnite player confirmed?!?!?
Klombo isn’t dead he’s just hibernating
People Didnt like the Dragon Breath Shotgun beacuse they couldnt hit their shots or hit that juciy 152
Max is so bad
Man I loved planes
this man dosent know what hes talking about tannnnnnnnjnkkkkkkkkks
I think the first over powered gun was actually the zapotron
Tanks arent that bad i find they give fortnite a more fun challenging aspect in no build mode since what i usually do is charge at the tank driver and hop in his gunners seat then shoot his own tank making him have to bail it feels alot more fun with then without in my opinion
I actually have 2 account I want to merge I hope they bring it back
Why this show when I searched twerk battle
Ok
173rd
This is why I hate fortnite
Bruh plz do more
Fortnite tweeted that the klombos are in hibernation or hiding
i left a like on every single comment in the first hour for this acount
Existing is the biggest mistake
No u did by the thumb nail by replacing recon specialist with renagade raider
I just love it when the notification pops up "someone liked your comment" or "you got a new subscribers" it makes me so happy 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Fornite will never make everyone happy just be happy with what the state of the game is!
People tht played in the season 7 are og's?
Am I the only one who loved the planes in season 7?
I actually love tanks yeah their a little op but not to much bc they take so much fuel slow and big targets so u can take them out with strategy but when u have 2 people who are good at driving and shooting on a tank it ain’t good
My family share a PS4 in my brother room and my other brother don’t let me go on it and it’s not even his so I couldn’t play Fortnite, I haven’t even been to tilted and I haven’t met klombos dinosaur, and they got removed already
@epicgames 😡😡😡
Fortnite makes so many mistakes like bruh they love money so much that they love re-releasing OG skins
70k in an hour my man
Bro why this clickbaits
That's fake the item shop screen
Early much?
Infinity Blade in No Build Mode would be broken
You're right...they did make a mistake...Existing lol...Just kidding but As soon as...well Technically Chapter 1 season 6 came...Fortnite was now pronounced Garbage
i just noticed i got rickrolled
Fortnite is a mistake
The vault turrets are only I one place on the map right now it is near a factory
Ya
Fortnite just ruins childhood
Klombo is coming back their just hybitnating in the snow
they can't keep on getting away with this 👿
Me who likes the drum shotgun: ... The reason I like it cause it can get me easy kills, and any other shotgun
1 time
Klomp isnt gone everybody chill out. You can collect “evidence” that klombo is alive now. And yes you get a notification by fortnite if you find a peace👍🏻
hi i am foor
Do not make a video like this ever again
Your opinion is not fact, get over what Fortnite has done, I disagree with 90% of everything you said
I loved fortnitemares
This isn’t asuras wrath
Oh yeah the light machine gun is coming back..
120th comment and this was released 52 minutes ago i was so early
Top mistake fortnite made: Existing.
I am the 42,990 person who has watched this video I’m not kidding
HI i hope you read this, if you do keep up the good work
Klombo is back
I wish fortnite put the infinity blade back into the game
Me at the end what about the fake reigned raider in the thumbnail
They always make big mistakes, because the game is bad
fortnite isprobably adding lmgs back because it was in the c3s2 trailer
Nice click bait
I know one thing stronger than the infinity blade the infinity gauntlet and maybe mechs
Fortnite itself was a mistake
100th
👋 hi
That huge mistake is u
All so with the infinity blade I pretty sure it came out just before a tournament.
i hope pump shootgun comes back
True
Not releasing neo or trinity on the mayrix colab or not adding nathan drake as gaming legends instead of the shitty movie..
rip dwayne haskins
The power of photo shop
I want to add one, fortnite removed the SEA server and won't bring it back again
U mean uh pump vaulted season 9 soz but ye
click bait thumbnail tho
I loved the bows
Imagine this gets pined
this was soooo accurate
E
Pump got removed in season9 not season x
These videos is the thing we need
haha ghoul & skull never should had gotten those og styles since they were never og to begin with there were halloween based skins makes sence to release them only on halloween that was a big mistake of epic to gave those 2 skins a og look like i  understand for some skins like recoon expert like i know 3 skins thats should get a og style that was Marshmello and if they decide to bring them back Travis Scott & Astro Jack
Hi
You should make a video about the sweatiest skins pro players don’t (or do) main
When Fortnite will learn from their mistakes?

0:38 Klombo isn't dead. Klombo is sleeping in the winter region
Hi
Klombo actually isn't dead he's actually hiding it you go north of Logjam Lumberyard you'll see a mound of snow similar to Season 1 where Klombo was before and if you go to it it will say "Is Klombo hibernating or hiding"
First
I think Fortnite taking out klombos was the saddest thing
If they have killed klombo,tilted would not be on the map
