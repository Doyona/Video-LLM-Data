She looks so happy, glad she has one of her little fosters as her very own. She was acting like a besotted mom worried about her baby. Now he's a happy spoiled baby with 3 loving parents.
Animals are from the angelic realm as are these wonderful people who care for them.
Sassy lil tripod boi 😻
Thanks to Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ amen
Heartbreaking, precious, sad kitty and awesome dog.  What a positive change after surgery and what a great vet you have!  So happy for the entire family♥♥♥
This will, at first, sound morbid, but I’m glad they were able to preserve his hip joint. When cats need an amputation, preserving the joint really helps their balance
so sweet
Another Miracle Kitten is Puffs at TinyKittens.
Kittens hissing is too adorable ❤Thanks for sharing
A great story and a good cry....where is my Kleenex?
GOD Bless you all.
❤❤❤❤❤
Tuxies rule!
🥹 This Is Such A Beautiful Story-& Testimony For PiediNo! Such Beautiful & Lovingly Blessed Babies You've Got Here Eleonora! God Is Good!!!! Jesus Loves You All! ✝️🥰🙏🏻💗
You're loved no foot ❤. You too sharon.
What a great story
It made me so happy to see Eleonora accept and UNDERSTAND PiediNo biting her. I feel most of the world would just be like "what's wrong with this stupid cat?!?" and some sadly might have even hit him but he was just stressed and in pain. Eleonora listened to what he was telling her and kept trying to comfort him ❤
I can’t believe how tiny PiedNo was 🥺😍❤️
Such a kind lady!
" Piedino" oh you guys 😉
So heartwarming.  Thank you for being such a good owner to two wonderful animals.
😭😭
Omg so cute thank God for people like you ❤
Good story that
Chúďa a bez nôžky 🐈😢 a havo krásny so zaujímavými očkami 👍🐕
Good stuff
I wasn't ready for no legs part 💔
Sweet
Aww, what amazing, guess it is!... God bless together love with, hmm? Just glad it is wonderful! 💖😍💖
A lovely kitten but, please, let alone italian, please... we have not a single word for no-foot and the only legitimate form of "piedino" means "little foot". Except that, this little, furry thing is just lovely. 💖💖💖💖
I love that the husky is named Sharon!
Precious and Blessed both of them
This is so sweet. Beautiful fur babies. Why can't people treat each other the way this sweet husk does.
So awesomely special, thank you
Piedino is such a handsome fella! Thank you for letting him grow up into such a wonderful kitty!
Husky is the Queen here... Today's culture is so obsessed with Male-Female competition that we forget our Mothers' and Fathers' sacrifices.
I knew some of these meowing sounds from another video of a Siamese kitten. Why the hell did you need to edit them in? Makes zero sense.
🥰🥰🥰
I think our huskys are blood relatives  mine is exactly the same I mean identical  100%
CUUUUUUUTTTE!
Animals that know they got a 2nd chance have the most unusually awesome personalities. They seem to live life twice as hard. I saved mine at 3 weeks with pneumonia and she gives the same sassy nips when you pet her and she's ALWAYS in the mood to play, even at 4 years old. This cat seems to be the same way, what a great pair🙂
Aww yis, that's that hit of dopamine and sweetness that I needed. Best in life to you, PediNo, and to you, sharon!
Sharon is such a nice dog.  I hope both of them stay healthy happy lives
Considering how many 4 leg, healthy kittens get killed everyday, keeping a 3 leg or unhealthy one is stupid, cruel and pointless.
Funny enough piedino also means tiny feet in Italian... But i get the meaning piedi-no/no-feet
"piediNO" means "NOfeet" and "piedino" means "tiny foot". Smart.
“Piedino” is an Italian diminutive word that essentially means “little foot” or “footsie”. “Fare piedino” means “to play footsie” with someone. It does not mean “no foot”. None the less, this cat is adorable.
Piedino means "presserfoot". "Senza piede" would be "no-foot".. 🙄 😂 but lovely story ^^
Dogs are not mans friend, they are everyone's friend.
Love these types of vids
Actually Piedino means little foot in italian, still a pretty adorable name, very fit.
poor cat. So cute though.
0:53. Sound the kitten makes is added. I recognize that sound from a non dodo video.
Animals don't ever let their disabilities keep them from enjoying life.
tidy
Sharon: 👁️👁️
this is why i prefer animals than humans  ^^  (call me crazy,  is a gratification for me )
Bless you for taking care of that kitten like that.
what the hell dodo? 0:53 this meow is stolen from another video here on youtube called "Siamese Kitten LOUDEST Purring" featuring billie the kitten. i just find it weird why insert the noise from another video???
Protect the Kittehs!
Poor thing, feel bad for what it had to go through, so happy that it has found a loving home!
Now this is freindship!
Do you know about the iguverse project and its help-to-earn model.  Where each user of the system will have to allocate at least 1% of their income to help the shelter and organizations helping animals around the world?
Got me crying in the club
1:07 OMG!!!
I am a arseninst
What no feet ?
wait a minute... when she was small she looked like my kitten and when she did grow up she look like my kittens mom!
That looks just like my boy.
Awesome
"Piedino" means "small foot", BUT if you make a PUN it actually goes "piedi-no", which could mean many things, among which "no foot".
heart melted
What a sweet story God bless these lovely creatures..
Tripod Dingus
watching this brings tears to my eyes. 3 years ago my cat died of cancer with 11 years, 2 weeks ago my dog, 8 years died because of bladder cancer. Did everything possible to effort the expenses, but in the end she just died while having seizures. They both grew up together, the dog was the pub, she even adapted typical cat behaviors like jumping everywhere she could reach. The bonds between animals are just special, whereas humans cant even live alongside eachother
Piedino means small foot, in italian.
Aww! 🥰
Im a edm music producer and trying grow my channel! Im at 76 subs trying hit 1k! Once I hit 1k I’ll do video showing how I made my song 🎵 that earned 65k views!
Cry in pain, no Vet?
I like how he kept biting you but you just continued to be there for him until he accepted it and calmed down. I feel like a lot of aggressive people are like that inside....hurt kittens.
🥹🤗🤗 so glad you took care of the kitten God bless you and that sweet beautiful dog🥰
i cried during this video..
How do i fall in love with the kitty AND the pup in under 4 mins? How? and HOW are they both SO ADORABLE that they'd register at ♾ on the Cuteness Scale?
Thank for sharing I have same type cat we took in as a baby we have two older cats already in house , we called her Bela like Bela Lugosi’s Dead song by Bauhaus cause her face and ears look like A Bat :-) shares 1- 6 months old and sometimes terrorize the older cats it’s funny to watch her !!
That was very up lifting and positive..thanks for sharing , all the best to you and yours..many happy adventures together... semper fi...
This channel renews my faith in humanity some
A hundred _Thank You's_ for sharing your story, & for uploading this video.  I've got absolutely nothing against other dog breeds, but now everyone can understand why me & so many people are forever partial to Huskies.  Any sled breed, really:  Japanese Akita & Samoyed, too 💜❤💜❤
💕💖😾🐶
Dogs really are the best
thanks 4 helping him❤️
He’s like take the nub take it take it
Huskys aren't giant.
So cute....great job!
What a beautiful Bond you've encouraged I hope you have the opportunity to reach out and help heal many animals in need.
Wait, you guys add extra noises in post? Oh wow, you do. You ripped the audio from "Siamese Kitten LOUDEST Purring" by Beatshack and added it to this! Hahahahaha! Lame!
That is a great animal friendship.
Give him a artificial leg
Huskys are incredible dogs.  I am a cat AND dog person.  During my career as an airline pilot, cat made sense because.  Now, I'm in a Townhouse and dogs are not allowed, unless service.  And, I am getting a hip replacement
😻😻😻😻😻😻🐶🐶🐶🐶
This is beautiful! 🤍 His story warms my heart. Just a side note: “piedino” means “Little Foot” in Italian. It fits well also like this but it was probably a minor error due to the fact that in English to put a noun in the negative form you usually put before or after “no”. Probably you used the translator to find a word with “no foot”, so you used “piede” (foot) and no to negate the word (cause also in Italian means no). So… piediNO. It’s a misconception. Piedino it’s a diminutive in Italian, expressing something little. If you wanted a real translation it would be “senza piede” or “azzoppato” or “zoppo” but it would also not be the same 😥. So, me being picky aside, it fits and it’s cute. I hope I had explained it well cause I read a comment of a fellow Italian with some rude answers telling that what he was saying was not true… so I explained the meaning very carefully. Hope to not be considered picky about the name of a cat 😅 it wasn’t my intention.
👍👍👍👍👍👍
They are siblings no doubt. Can't separate that. Thanks for sharing your story
What a beautiful relationship they have!
🥹🥹🥹
Thats weird. senza piede is the italian for no-foot or footless. No such thing as piedeno or piedino. Its like ordering fettuccine alfredo in italy. IT DOESNT EXIST.
You guys are the best!  I wish more people would adopt animals that need special care.  And Sharon is without a doubt a sweetheart!  Keep up the good work love ya dudes!
So it seems that not only humans don't deserve dogs...
That is so awesome. Thanks for sharing. Your Husky should win "dog of the year". So well behaved and caring. I used to have a German Shepherd, female, and on two occasions I got kittens for our family as well. Only the Shepherd could play with them, and as much as the cats would annoy her on occasion, she protected those cats as if they were her own puppies. And once the cats knew this, they would run underneath the standing dog whenever they felt threatened. It was quite remarkable actually, I was so surprised. Best of buddies they were
The cat looks almost identical to my brothers cat, she was also found in the woods alone as a baby. She had a broken leg and the vet said the odds of it healing are very low and it will probably have to be amputated, she was the tiniest kitten I’d ever seen and she had to be in a crate for ages with her bandaged leg, she cried out so much too. But thankfully her leg healed perfectly and now she’s a 1 and a half year old menace who just adores following my 11 year old cat around like a shadow. 💗
I mean hey. A chair with 3 legs is more stable than a chair with 4.
😪
porque o cachorro não faz o que ele é programado para fazer?
Ho pianto che meraviglia
God bless you for giving these two all the love and care they deserve. 💜🌷
Women are God greatest invention...Thank you Lord
The Dodo videos never fail to put a smile on my face
Your Sharon is a real angel....hugs for both sweeties.
"I've never seen a kitten in his condition."  I have. We picked up a stray kitten maybe 3-4 years ago. Same color scheme, but had all 4 legs. Problem was, we had a dog who was very touchy about food, and he lashed out and broke his jaw. The vets had to wire it up while we fed him with a syringe. He died shortly after, he just couldn't eat enough. Rest in peace Spike. I hope you and your attacker are on better terms in heaven (the latter died of twisted stomach a couple years later).
Thank you for sharing this beautiful video  ❤❤
you are an amazing person for saving that adorable kitten.  I felt so bad hearing about a kitten being left behind but wormed my heart to see him in a good home.  I also loved how your dog became best friends with a kitten so cute!!!
This is one of the few times I cry :)
Beautiful
Should had named it pirate for a missing leg
What a moving story, animals instinctively know when something is wrong.. As any behaviourist will know Cats only attack, bite, hiss as a last resort with another animal through fear and the horrible one is pain.. It was sad to see but short lived and seeing the recovery was so beautiful. They are true soulmates and I am so glad they both now own you 😇😁😇 Thank You for sharing this beautiful clip with us all, you are truly one special lass 🙏😇🙏❤️🙏😇🙏
BFF 😇
Man...we have so much to learn from animals. The most powerfull force in this Universe is LOVE!
Except my tears I don't have any words just to say thank you for saving his life ND giving him second chance to make  life happy
Thats so so heartwarming 💖 💕
nice story
how beautiful together .. good life
U don't want to help cats u just wanted to Make this video!!!!!!
I could  give you kittens much worse than him !!!! Probably every year!!! Put ur money where ur mouth is u jerks !!!!!!!!
Dang, these allergies....
What an amazing husky!
😍❤
so cute kitty.
Imagine if both of the managed to make some crazy dog cat breed
I've seen a lot of videos of dramatic husky, but yours certainly has a different soul.
1:53 the husky is just like "what about me?"
0:47 IS JUST THE CUTEST RELATIONSHIP I'VE EVER SAW! 💖
Dogs and cats living together. It's mass hysteria! But it's the cutest thing ever.
Why wouldn’t he want to play “like any other kitten”? His disability isn’t who he is, even though you named him for his disability, which is hard to understand. (Would you like being called Big Butt Camille, if you had a large derrière?) The missing leg is just how he looks, like having blue eyes or spots or stripes.
When there is a growing parasitic population living off the backs of the working people..democrats have become a nationwide problem!..the Brandon administration is to blame for all this and more!
Aw man she's gonna be heartbroken once she finds out "Piedino" actually means "little foot" and not "no foot". :(
0:53 those are exact sounds ripped from a kitten Siamese cat video, very strange
My heart melted from watching this ☺️
We don’t adopt animals we own them. You adopt a child and raise them and be their parents but an animal you own and keep around the house like furniture.
Fun fact: not only is PiediNo italian for no foot (Piedi = feet, No = no lmao), piedino also means "little foot" What a cute name!
CUTE!!! I have a Kitten like Yours. her name is Princess. I love Kittens
I love how so many foster stories turn out like "there was no choice but to adopt them"
💓💓💓
Piedino doesn't actually mean no-foot, it means tiny foot, something like that. Or otherwise if you separate the the two words No Piedi  you can translate them as No Foot (but still this isn't 100% grammatically correct).
"Piedino" means "small foot" in italian
💌💌💌💌💌💌
Very Sweet.🤗
Damnit, MY HEART!
I just love this story, Even though a petty cat Was in pain. When he got better I felt so relieved. It's so adorable and sweet that Sharon would take care of him. What an adorable pair together.
Cool ass cat!!!
This beautiful story made me cry cos it’s so full of hope and love! 🥲🥰
I'm sure it has been said already but Piedino (pee-eh-dee-know) means little foot, not no foot.  Edit: in light of the spelling shown Piedi-No could also be literally translated as stated.
Does the cat's name translate into "no foot"?
Excellent works!
is it a perfect family, isnt it?
Her dog’s eyes look so human wtf 💀💀 1:52
Siete bellissimi
<3
He needs a wooden leg then he will become a Lil pirate kittie
I have the same breed of cat what breed is it tho
Best friends 💓 💕 adventure time 👀💯
Animals will always show us the way to become better humans
August 4th, 2022 Sharon and Piedino are the cutest 😭
:57 this from another video
Wish we could afford a dog .
the cat is cute, the lady is a google translate enjoyer, the name she gave to her is horrible
Abandoned a kitten I can't even imagine when humans are bad they are the worst species on the planet.... That is one precious kitten/cat and I love your husky
Ohhh, that poor sweet baby
heartbursting...
this one brought tears to my eyes! hope Piedino continues to flourish. so lucky to have you and a whole husky to watch over him. 💓
Cats and dogs are both such lovely creatures
Hello, piedino in Italian means literally Little foot. Piedi no means no foots. I like piedino more)
i’ve had three huskies in my life they r the most intuitive, friendly, and playful dogs i’ve ever owned.
She named her kitten PiediNO but for doing joke about his handicap. But she doesnt realize in italian Piedino mean "small feet"
What is this moisture forming in my eyes?
0:39 **dies**
❤️❤️❤️🥰🥰😘😘
❤️❤️
Damn. that dog’s gooooood 😎👍🏼
This (0:53) sounds familiar...
"Ah, so I see you chose snuggles!" More Sharron please. Much more.  In fact, all the Sharron please. PiedNo is a gorgeous lil thing too.
Am i the only one that can see toothless in the thumbnail lol. That kitten is cute
❤❤❤❤❤
This is so sweet and adorable, what a strong kitty 🤍🖤🐈
I needed to see this in my life, thank you.
Looked at the cat and said “toothless?”
^^
👏👏👍🙏👍👏👏
Thank you dodo for learn humanity us
I feel really happy for these folks that their husky is so good with cats! My family was a cat household that tried adopting two different husky puppies on separate occasions, and both ended up brutally killing some of our kittens. My mom swore off owning huskies after that, but at least Sharon is the opposite of our experience! And what a beautiful girl, too!!!
Omg that's the sweetest husky and lucky happy kitten
That baby kitty hiss! ❤️❤️❤️
So sweet
Piedino means Little foot in italian ❤️ Oh wait but maybe u called him Piedi-No that means no feet 😅

i'm not crying i swear, just these damn onions i'm peeling.
Adorable   ❤️🌹x ♾=🥰 ♾
I love foster fails.
Everytime I see Husky being sweethearts, I remember this jerk that told me "Huskies are a catkiller breed, they can't live with them, their instinct is to eat them" when I was a kid...
Piedino means little foot
I’m not crying , YOURE crying !!! 😭😭😭😭❤️❤️❤️❤️
Ohh he was missing both back feet:(

Extremely cute, but “piedino” in Italian means “small foot”
tiny kits hissing so sad and cute
What would the world be like without cats and dogs
So many beautiful people in the world - you are one.❤️
So sweet
Well done 👏 for saving the cat 🐈
All Soo cute
Both Soo cute
Animals in general, have an amazing capacity for empathy towards each other, especially when one of a different species, is in need…
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤GOD BLESS YOU😃😍😍😍😍
Poor kitty  Bless him and the good people who saved him!
Missing a leg is scary if anyone out there has a similar situation with their pet I hope this story helps. I had a cat who at 1 year old lost part of her leg to a farming machine. She then went to the vet and had the rest of that leg removed. This NEVER slowed her down and with only 3 legs she lived another 15 years running, playing, and climbing trees. I don’t think she even realized she was technically “disabled” lol
I am in Love with this kitty.
💘💔👏👏❤❤💖💞
Beautiful little kitty
"I am Death on three legs, have at thee!"
❤❤❤❤
The cat and the dog are so adorable 😍 but piedino in italian means small foot
Love this story. Thank you for sharing.,
Several years ago we had a Husky. She was young and full of energy. When we took in a tiny abandoned kitten I was very concerned about the tiny baby. Nicole (the dog) could have killed him with one swipe of her paw. I tried to keep them separate but Herbert found that sleeping with a very wooly dog was quite warm. We have photos of that tiny kitten curled up against Nicole’s belly, sleeping like the baby that he was. They never had a problem.
Awesome story. What a gorgeous dog Sharron is.
❤
😍😍❤️❤️
❤❤❤❤❤
0:52 ngl that kitty sound is rly familiar 🤔
Very cute
This is adorable! I love this video so much, but I just have the smallest concern about the cats name piedino. So I am Italian and the thing about the name piedino is that it doesn’t mean no foot it means small foot I’m just a bit confused why they said no foot but other wise I am in love with the video! ❤️
Sure.. I like dags
Nice video…  Piedino in Italian means “Little foot” PiediNo literally means “Foot No”
What a video made with much efforts great and lovely family
Piedino doesn't mean that in italiano btw.....
saw a husky jump a 7ft fence to kill about 14 chickens was a massacre.
What is it with black and white cats. They always have a white belly and white socks, and then the white splash on their upper lip. Looks just like my boy
This video made me so happy i cried a little
Videos like this keep me going in these crazy times we live in. 🙂
Cat attacks dog.  Dog: Come get this love you freak🤣😛
VAR: There was no tacklin! No foul!
PiediNo is original! Ciao ciao from south Italy
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
The Dodo always give us a beautiful story💕
This is such a sweet story with a happy ending.
Mhhh... Google translate hits again
One cat, one dog and one bird will be perfect pets
🥹 precious
this is nice and all but piedino is such a stupid name lmao
Seems like another forced human trying to make $$ on a dodo story
I love how the husky is named Sharon ✨🫶🏾
Thank you for sharing 😊 so heartwarming
omg the start of the video cute wittle bundle >.<
I love the name Sharon for a Husky
The sound of your voice, is more feeble than the kitten! Do you have a sore throat?
omgeee..so sweet the two of them..thank you for sharing.
One of the most adorable videos i watch on youtube, Agree if u like🥰👍
This is really heartwarming ❤️
So very sweet ♥️
I saved a kitten who looks a lot like Piedino. He was just a little bag of bones when he came to me one summer day. Almost dead of starvation and thirst. I'm sure he'd been on the street all his life. Wasn't sure I needed another cat, but hey, what're ya gonna do? Now, 4 years later he's a gorgeous tuxedo cat with gold eyes that have emerald green centers. What's more, he has enriched the life of my other cat and I wouldn't trade him for the world. Saving an innocent animal and giving him a good home is one of the most rewarding things I've ever done.
Totally cute Blessings Now and always be well stay strong
Poor kitten- damn
😻😻🥰🥰
Your dog is an angel sent from heaven
👍😽😍👍😽😍
God bless you🙏☺️
Such beautiful babies, I wish you all the best in your lives together.
Sharon and my Husky Bloo could be twins!!! She’s so good with PediNo, just proof love can bring about wonderful things ♥️
We can all learn a lesson from animals:  do for one another.
We just rescued an 8-ish week orphaned medium hair tuxedo from our woods.  They're such awesome cats!
So beautiful!
Lesson for humans.
There’s nothing more beautiful to me than the relationship between a kitty cat and a puppy dog.
Thank God for people and pets like you
AWWWWWWWWWWWW
PiediNO purrito so cute
I had a friend that named his cat, "Yard" I asked why, he said because the cat only had 3 feet.
Thank you for saving him....(!!! if I happen to win the lottery big,, cheques will fly out people like you....  !!! )
Man I love animals!
Quw bello bebe😍
My ex tried telling me once that huskys and cats dont get along😂😂😂
I was crying so much I had to wipe the tears with my Glock to feel manly again 🥲

Good to have real animals featured on here instead of murderbreed shitbulls.
Thank you so much for being you!!!! The Dodo Rocks!🎸

This made my heart swell with joy. I foster cats but side-note; growing up we always had a dog and a cat together. Always special but when I went off to college I came back w/2 kittens whom lost their mother and our family dog, Maggie took them on as if they were her own babies. So beautiful to watch.
You will have good fortune for the rest of your life for saving this kitten. Advice: Play the lottery. You're welcome.
Angels in disguise it's what they are
God, the love I have for animals 😩
Loved video. Thanks for saving and helping this cute and adorable kitty.  Bless you and family for adopting and giving him a forever home with a great partner in crime. Such a beautiful and caring dog.😽😽😽😽😽😽😽❣️💞💖❤️💕💗💓💓💗💕💕💕❤️😍
Piedino in Italian means “little foot”
These kind of stories put a smile on my face, God bless you!
I just love watching cats and dogs being BFF’s….melts my heart ♥️
Thank you very much so cute kitty and nice lovely dog ❤️💙❤️💙❤️💙🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
Cute husky, poor kitty
What a beautiful relationship between cat and dog! Thank you for adopting the kitty and giving him a chance at a happy family life!
That little kitten found himself a new mommy
Precious moments what a beautiful story with a wonderful end you could tell how much they loved each other 💕❤️
So flipping cute
<3
👍
You and your Husky are Angels for helping and loving this tiny fur baby.❤️🙏
Love this story! Also as an italian... well PiediNo is a pun actually, piedino per se means "little foot" but the "no" at the end it's a negation, so it's a pun for "without a foot"  Edit: spelling mistake
Piedino is Italian for "little foot" ;-) (from piede = foot).
This is so beautiful. ❤️
That. Was the single cutest kitten. Ever.  The hiss and roll basically broke, melted, then reformed my heart all at once lmao
“If my people, who are called by my name, will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven, and I will forgive their sin and will heal their land.” 2 Chronicles 7:14❤️ Please don’t take this lightly guys repent today, no day is promised so do it now, here’s the sign you’ve been looking for. God loves you and so do I❤️❤️
Am the only one wondering why his cat looks like 'Toothless'??
Animals have figured it out. Why can't we?
Absolutely precious 🥰❤️💕🥰❤️💕
Aw, that’s so sweet.  God bless them.
Aaah. What's with women these days and all this vocal-fry nonsense?! Drink some water... or is it done in a futile attempt to be cutesy?
HE IS SO CUTE!! :D
Stop melting my heart!
Awesome husky. love seeing dogs cohabitate with cats
Feel sorry there's humans who exist who would abandon this baby. Not much makes me more disturbed
Love me some kitties ! ❤️👍🏽👍🏽
❣️❣️😍
😍😍😍😍😍
I love it. I don't get why a beautiful video like this still gets dislike.
damn, they used the loud saiamese kitten purring audio
What a little angel
We rescued a three legged cat and named her Tripod. She moved around so fast and easily. Amazing how they can adapt!
Dio ti benedica.Tu sei meraviglioso.
🥺❤
to be COMPLETELY honest i did do and/or probably will SOMEWHAT like huskies and cats
My cat Oreo looks so much like him he's ten
Peoples dogs and cats hugs,licks each other .. When it comes to my dog and cat theyre always fighting haha

Most good pets just seem to know when someone is sick I find :O

These stories are always over the top, talk about milking it!
He’s a little rascal❤️
How Can you put clothes on a cat???What is wrong with u?
I'm Italian and hearing this name is painful
The cat is so tiny and cute the dog is also cute
Pure love! Really brought tears to my eyes.
That's why I tell people all the time if you're going to have a dog and it's a female little have her false little puppies before you fix them because she could be a really good mother or she can be a really sucky mother that way she'll have her own babies
0:52 bro this sounds are from another cat video, the one petting a siamese purring kitten or sonething like that
Precious
I love 💕 stories like this
She didn’t wana pay for the vet to fix a ruptured ACL on a cat , so the leg had to go
This is so cute I love this story.

Piedino in Italian actually means "small foot". The correct name to represent the fact that he is missing a foot is "senza piede"
Fun fact: in Italian piedino mean also small foot
"Dogs and cats living together ... MASS HYSTERIA!" (You know the movie)

Piedino = Little Foot
This is really a heartwarming video, thank you for your kind act to take care of this lovely cat. They are so beautiful and harmonious, I hope they can live a healthy and happy life
Husky dogs...very intelligent and clever
Jesus Christ called people everywhere to repent, therefore, if you confess with your lips the Lord Jesus and believe with all your heart that God
Piedino means Small foot, No piedi means No-foot but that's not the same thing
In italian Piedino means "little foot" :)
piedino means little foot in italian.
The cat in the thumbnail looks like a toothless cute ❤️
НИЗКИЙ ПОКЛОН ВАМ👍👍👍😘😘😘😘
Piedino in Italian means little foot, not without a foot😉. He is awesome!
Pedino looks almost exactly like my cat, Buzz. Except Buzz has four legs, but has no tail
aww, Sharon is so patient and loving with Piedino, it's so cute :)
😭

What an adorable pair
Tuxies are the funniest.
I had a Persian Tuxedo, same colors as that, that used to fight (and loved) two huskies with very similar colors as well, although I think they’re a different type of husky. Sadly one of the huskies was put down for a tumor, and shortly after the cat had a CHF and passed away as well. We weren’t sure of the cat’s age, probably like 8 or 9, but the husky was a male that passed at 17, and his sister, the other one, is still alive and I think is nearing 19, that or she is 19, but either way she’s old and still somewhat lively.
Piedino means small foot
What a beautiful story thank you for sharing these two very special little babies I wish them long happy lives together!!!  Also thank you for being such a special caring person
DIY Jinx
So moving, I cried. Aren't dogs just the most wonderful beings? Aren't humans at their best the most wonderful beings too?
I have tuxedo cats.  That little baby was so tiny with the leg missing.  The dog and cat are so beautiful together!! So glad you gave him a home and brother.  Makes me so happy.  🐈 🐕
Such a sweet story! Never separate them 🥰🥰🥰
good doggy 🐕‍🦺🐕‍🦺🐩🐩🐕🐕🐕🐕🦮🐩🐕‍🦺🐕‍🦺🐕‍🦺🐕‍🦺

My Husky is terrified of my tiny little cat
ALHAMDULILLAH(SWT), ASTAGHFIRULLAH(SWT).
Very Nice Bro! Get Good People!
Gosh! Such an awesome beautiful story! Love this so much❣
Best story yet…..
Both so special and precious  💕 that husky is such a sweetheart, so gentle and patient 💕 I love the bond that has happened between them 💖 love this, thx for sharing!
Huskies are ridiculous drama fur nuts...but so often the most kind sensitive creatures...
What is this… leaking from eye?! You got a truly special dog!! Can see it in her eyes…. She has nothing but LOVE to give!
Awe he's looks just like our new kitten skuzzlebutt. She's just as crazy with our bulldog too.also likes pine cones and attacking us under the covers lol
PiediNo was an adorable kitten. ❤️❤️❤️❤️This is such a special bond. It made me cry.
Every time I watch these I just know they are going to kill me but I love watching them anyway.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤👍⚡
What a blessing see your beautiful soul !
Even the ugliest creature responds to love
Piedino as a whole word actually means little foot in italian (and is a cute word too) 😅😅 they literally translated no-feet = piedi-no
Ah poor kitty cat
You and Sharon are amazing! Beautiful story!🇨🇦
Describing this story as heartwarming would be a severe understatement.
1:07 My heart…🥺
Yup, Sharon made the decision for you. Piedi No is her cat.  You had no say in the matter.
Just Grrrreat!
God will Bless you and Sharon for your big hearts ♥️
What a drama queen!
My husky wants to eat the kitty next-door… I’m not sure how to make peace between them since the kitty is not my kitty… 😢
Them beautiful Husky eyes. Wish them both a happy life together 💓
This video has gotten me tearing 😢 up! ❤️
Actually piedino in italian common slang means little foot... Hi from Italy
Wonderful!  God bless you.
Beautiful!💕😻
They are both so cute
I love the video!! Thank you for sharing such a great story.👍
This is so heartwarming
Love❤️❤️❤️
What an adorable family this is! I live with my two beloved cats, one of them ist a three-leg angel, and i know, how wonderful this is.
They are treasures and so adorable.
I had a husky that went to doggy heaven a couple years ago named Jasmine and looked identical to your husky. She was 14 and was as much of a sweetheart towards others as she is.. Cherish the times you have with them!
Aww he's so little and so cute. And that tiny little hiss. 😍
Piedino means little foot in Italian.
Aww 😻💖
Thank you for what you did for this kitten!
Idk what to say i love no foot I love mama Sharon both so precious and dear
Thank you Eleanora for caring 🤍
I missed my cat so much 😭 after 12 years of the headaches I wish so much he would be here to continue annoying me? Jijijijiji 😆 jk. My cat had all the same colors on near the same spots as Piedino.
Adorable !
Wonderful cat care!😊
I love it
❤❤
That's wonderful! This woman is amazing. He is so cute playing with the dog.
Awe...these two siblings are adorable.  I love how Sharon is so gently with pedi.
God bless you
😇😇😇👍
Thank you for adopting this kitten and taking care of him ~~~  When my cat was ill and we took her to the hospital, my dog was really worried... And was really happy seeing her back. I didn't know the dog could totally understand what's going on.
He look like toothless the dragon
HES SO CUTE PLEPASSSE
Cats are amazing pets and every family should have one. I hated them when I was younger but have grown to love them as an adult. Truly awesome companions to have.
Mom my brother
Who's the animal on this planet?
💞💞💞💞💞
What a beautiful relationship. Sharon is wonderful!
God bless u all 😭❤️
Eating WATER MELON and suddenly tears began 2 run down my cheeks ! GOD IN HEAVEN CAN BRING SOO MUCH JOY !
I'm so glad PiediNo is no longer in so much pain and he's got his best protector, Sharon, watching over him. You should consider contacting Derrick Campana, the Wizard of Paws, who is an amazing animal prostheticist. Sharon would really have to watch her back if PiediNo had four limbs! 😂
If only the "adults" (well, most of them) would shut up their yammering and pay more attention and listen to our children and our animals we'd all be so much better off. JMHO. God bless this family and these precious, precious animals!
I think if you can't have the original person narrate their story, you should get someone who's a good storyteller to read it! The narration really threw me off because it sounded insincere. Adorable story though!
🥲🥰😍❤️✊🏽🙏🏽👍🏽
That husky looks just like mine
Thank God that the kitten had a good mother to take care of him. She gave him the love and attention he needed. Thank you, Sharon.
God Bless+
Absolutely Precious Furry Babies 🐶🐱🌟💗💙💕
Beautiful story. The husky feels that is the kitten’s mom. That’s adorable.
Que Dios te bendiga por ese amor tan grande para esos hermosos 😻🐕🙏♥️🥰🤝
My husky and kitten are playing as I am watching this. The kitten just pounces all over and attacks my husky. But he doesn't care he plays back and very gentle
I'm not much of a dog person, definitely a cat person...I could go for a husky, though.
Thanks for s t kitten 💜🥰🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿☮️
We humans do not deserve pets. We could learn so much from them.
Ahhhh..sweet..💕
Foster fail, YEAHHHHH!!!
Sad but beautiful😅
Such a sad sad story with a happy outcome. I wonder when animals will stop suffering at the hands of humans. This poor little baby was sent a human and canine angel.
God, I love animals. They’re so amazing. ❤️❤️
Beautiful pair ❤
Clearly not Republicans :)
💖💖💖
It's not the size of the cat in the fight, it's the size of the fight in the cat.
Thank goodness there are amazing people like you caring for the innocent!  ✨💕✨🐈
He's so cute 🥰💜🖤
This made me cry. 😢😢
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
I love this 😀❤
What a great video...thanks for uploading this uplifting video!
Such as sweet husky and adorable little kitten. So glad you gave him a loving home. 😻😻😸
I've never seen anyone pet animals on the eyes that must be very annoying for the snimals...
Poor kitty :( Glad he found such a good human!
00:25 Anyone else turned around to see if these sounds came out of your own room?
Too adorable
It’s crazy how a cat will be a little shot when it’s in pain. You take it to the vet and it wakes up pain free. It’s like the cat knows you came to its rescue. Same thing happened when I got my cats teeth looked at back in the day. Total rot, broken and one had a hole through it. Imagine what what would be like. He got a deep clean and a few pulled. Ol he was totally different the second I picked him up from the vet. For like the next week would jump in my lap the second I’d sit down.
We as humans don't really deserve our pets .
I really couldn't stop laughing.
❤️❤️❤️❤️😻😻😻😻😻😻😻😻ty so much
Tough as nails and a role model. 😌 But also incredibly fortunate to have found such a great family!
I just perished from cuteness
How precious both of them!
So HAPPY YOU KEPT HIM❣️
Beautiful journey 🐕🦁❤️💃
💐
Wonderfully uplifting. You’re a fine human being for your love and care of that special kitty.
Oh my heart just melts.
Husky says who turned this little fur ball into a attack cat 🐈 😂
I saw no tackling.  Lies.  Sweet, nonetheless.
Just goes to continue to prove that dogs are so much better than cats.
Weems & Stephens Equine Hospital in Aubrey, TX murdered a horse named Black Lives Matter and stole his sperm. This horse and this family deserve justice. Please share this story. Their licensing should be revoked.
Bless you all x
Actually "piedino" in Italian means "small foot".
Such a sweet bean, with his white beard
I have a cat with an amputated leg - she lives the happiest life of all my cats :)
This made my heart flutter with joy thank u for opening your home to foster and especially thank u miss momma husky!! ♡♡♡
What an amazing story !
Very touching story but it's a bit fucked up to name your pet after their trauma, no? I had a cat growing up with fiv and 1 with diabetes but they were named Lucky and Boots.
سلام من  جندسءل پیش  از کمدخنجر خوردم از کسی که  زندگی ام  به او دلخوش بودم امید وارزوهآیم بود ولی بعد از پنج سال یک پسره پیدا ش در وزندکیما من را به طلاق کشید  و۴۵ روز صیقه اوشد فقط ۴۵روز  به خدا  سپردم  تو آز زندگی آن بگو!
My cat only has three legs too... I love these story's!!! Love the husky and cat!!!!
These stories never cease to amaze and bring me such joy! I LOVE ANIMALS, ALL OF THEM🤙
thank you. <3
Piedi-no translated would be feet no,  piedi is plural. Also, piedino (single word) means little foot
So Sweet!!!!!.
So great not seeing another shitbull video
You forgot to include a video clip of the kitten fully grown tackling the dog. Someone needs too fix that
As an Italian, I liked the name of the cat😊
I love these beautiful friendships! 😻 😸 I trained myself to be a better guardian so my fur kids can live a happy, loving, healthy, balanced life together. 💕
Im heartbroken to see such an adorable kitten without lil foot😢if i could i would give him mine without 2nd thought
Omggggggg he's so cute!!!!! 😭😭😭❤️❤️❤️❤️
Sharon is amazingly awesome for mothering PiediNO 🥹 can’t forget to point out how strong PiediNO was for overcoming everything 😁
These are my favorite stories ❤️
What an angel of a dog! This story is pure love all around 🍀
So sweet! 💯
Beautiful story!
Piedino in Italian means "little foot" And he's adorable!
"We made him a boot out of the finger of a glove" that is the cutest thing ever😩🤣
We need more people like you in the world.
Thanks Dodo I wasn't exactly wanting to cry today but here I am grown ass man crying in the club.
So, so precious. I’m in tears at the love, the bonding. Bless and protect all cats and all dogs; all animals, actually.
So cute  🐕🐈💙🧡💜🤍💋🌷🌻👍
This is no ordinary husky. Credit must go to you for raising them so well
He can still walk moslty okay, that is good :)
Thank you for realizing they needed to be together.. Bless all of you
What a "purrfect" trio! 😻👍💐🌹👏🙏🤗🌟🐱😻
Thank you MA'AM
That’s the least hyperactive husky that I’ve ever seen in my life
Thank you for taking care of him and helping him find a best friend
This kitty is lucky to have you and your doggie take care of him.🖤🙏
What a beautiful video! Sharon and Pedinoe truly have a very special bond, I'm so happy you adopted Pedi! Watching Pedi with Sharon was so endearing, Sharon is a beautiful, and kind soul.
Thank you❤️
Oh Sharon is a sweetheart. I have adopted my fathers husky since he assed 2 wks ago but my cats hate me and have lived under my bed since the dog has come to stay.
Who names their dog Sharon???
They are just toooo precious ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I really wish people would stop naming their pets after their disabilities. It's not cute.
True love knows  no boundaries. Not just for humans but for all animals. This is just amazing.
We also have a tripod!  They are wonderfully special.  Thank you for loving this little one.  And your Husky is a beautiful soul.  💕💕💕💕
Heart warming!
Beautiful cat 🐈‍⬛ and awesome dog 🐕 what a great bond they have
Hey! Did you know God is three in one!? The Father, The Son, and The Holy Spirit! Bless him! Jesus died for our sins, rose from the dead, and gives salvation to everyone who has faith in him! True faith in Jesus will have you bear good fruit and *drastically* change for the better!
I recently brought a kitten home and my husky has been so sweet with him. I think my husky thinks she's his mom.
Best friends 🐶🐈
Thank you
🥰😍🥰😍🥰😍😍😍
This is sooo sweet! And you and your husky are amazing!😘
This was the Best!
what an adorable pair of furry friends ❤❤❤
So cute I like when cat end dog together
I miss my 3 legged cat😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
💜
i never been an emotional guy but animals melt my heart when i see the condition prior to the rescue im not gonna lie i tear up thats why i tend to skip the bad bc not only does it get me emotional and teary eye it stick in my head  for along time and all i can think of and fantasy about is coming across the abuser and doing stuff to them i will not describe you have to really be a heartless evil piece of trash to harm any animal but i will tell you what karma is a b and your gonna pay ten times worse sooner or later it might take days weeks months years but its coming and for the rescuers you people are true hero's in my eyes your as much of a hero as  cops firefighters doctors emt nurses in my eyes words cant describe how much i respect you and appreciate you heroes plz keep up the amazing world changing work you do this world really needs you and these animals really depend on you i to will keep doing my best volunteering every chance i get but i cant foster bc there's no way i would be able to give it away after we bonnd i know myself and my house would be a zoo and a bit selfish on my part but i know it would effect my emotional health
So cute little kitten and Guys you are really beautiful peoples on the earth❤️👍😊😇🌹💖
You are going to have the kitten neutered isn't you
I have Husky his name is Rocky and he very Sweet boy🐺
Thank you for find and help kitten.God bless you.🙏🏻♥️
How cute
THANK YOU for sharing this story with us. It warms my heart.
I'm so happy this story turned out wonderfully.  I had tears and laughter watching it.  Thank you for being his saviour.  Also to his humans ♥️🐱♥️🐶♥️🐱♥️🐶
How much u wanna bet it was the dog that injured that poor kittens leg? Drop $ amounts below
😭
Peidino means littlefoot. Not no foot.
Are you going to get him a wheelchair to help him be more mobile?. Looks like he does well without one of his legs.
So beautiful. Their friendship
Animals like this make me a better human being....
A dog and cat that don’t hate each other on sight. Fancy that.
funny tripod cat
What a wonderful story.
So cute 🥰 thanks for saving the little 🐈‍⬛❤️ I m happy that he is okay now x beautiful cat x
The husky called this cat the N word 😞
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
=) warmed my heart
Our cat cut her tendon on a piece of glass and we spent over 600 $ on her but we need more to tie her tendon and we just left it like that cuz we have too many debts already :(
Humans can learn alot from the actions of other species.
Beautiful
I started a company called Ani-mold 3d, we make prosthetic limbs and 3d printed casts for animals at an affordable price. We’re starting by donating. Let me know if there’s anything I can do.
So glad you kept this foster
This video made me cry, if only humans were this kind and nurturing to each other like dogs and cats can be
Aw you can tell when he was "biting" you how much pain that he was in. Poor thing just wanted it to go away
Great
Real friendship
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Aww love the kitty and the beautiful husky.
💕💕🙏🙏
1:52 👁👄👁
Love the husky combat strategy of lay on cat. There is no counter.
I’m so happy you adopted him.  Sharon would have missed him so much.  She’s a lovely dog. 💕
Piedino reminds me of Toothless. 😜😘🥰
PiediNo was so tiny, I’d have been nervous caring for him too, but how amazing is Sharon!  I’m sure her devotion to PiediNo secured his survival alongside your help, a beautiful ending to such a tragic beginning for the little mite.  Great story💗🤍.
I hate when people say when they hear about a journey like this in animals: "why didnt u put him down? Its so expensive and the pain is not worth it" . I always say: yeah its painful but pain in usually just a phase, afterwards the reward of experiencingnlife, love is so  worth it. Who are we to take that away when we can give so much more than that. Thank you for taking up so much time and work to get to this point  where hencan now live a full life. :)
What a great dog. And really lovely to see that they get to spend the rest of their lives together.
Piedino literally means "small foot" in Italian. To say: "no feet" you would have to say "Senzapiedi" Senza = without, piedi = feet, or "Senzapiede" for "No foot". Or "Nessunpiede", for literally saying "no foot", which it would be hard to say in the plural, in fact you could not say "Nessunpiedi" it wouldn't make sense in Italian.
Amazing how animals just adapt.  Never are the victim they just move forward.  We as humans could learn from them
Love.
👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
I have a manx female born with half a right rear leg. We named her Hopkins. Though she hops as she "walks" to protect the stump leg, when she wants to motor, she can run like the wind on that stump. We LOVE her. Thanks for rescuing a wounded warrior.
Such a doll baby.
I love all of the videos you all put out. Mankind can learn alot watching God's beautiful animals and this is the way the good lord wants all to live"a loving caring life from us all" thank you for videos I watch all of them...
You should rename your dog to Pedie-cure for helping your cat ❤️
Piedino is not italian for "no foot" but italian for "small foot"-
🥰🥰🥰
❤🐈❤🐕❤
The dog’s look so clearly said: „we are keeping him, right, mom?“
I have no doubt that Piedino survived because Sharon nurtured him. When you are that tiny, a mother figure can make the difference between life and death .  Thank you for rescuing this tiny creature of God.
Котособак…😍
I so love how the Husky doggy is so gentle towards the kitten and even so when the kitten grew
Thank you, you have truly made a fantastic start to my day, what a wonderful video.
It's a great word pun, but in italian piedino means Little foot, not no-foot😅
I remember having a family cat back in the 90s who liked to sleep in the engine of my grandfathers car. One day, my grandfather drove about 8 miles to work. The cat must have been in the engine, because he crawled 8 miles home with his leg severely severed. We brought him to the vet who said the cat had to be put down. A month later, another vet heard about our cat and said the cat could have just had his leg amputated and then gone on to live a full life. And that the other vet was either lazy or incompetent. It always bugs me 25 years later that the cat struggled so hard to get home only to be killed by malpractice.
Sweet little one. Thanks for helping😻😻😻
🥴💕👍
Oh sh** didnt excpect to get recommended something this wholesome 😭
❤️❤️❤️
What a lovely story. Wonderful people and pooch and cat. Thank you for sharing
His feet is a little sus.. it seems to be cut off or something... Who the hell would do that if that's the case but it's good that he has a good life and happy now
u r a grt soul....keep loving them...
a dogmom and her catson
Each scene of this video was more adorable than the last until we reached a cuteness overload. 🤗🤗🤗🤗
By our faith in Jesus we became clean and as if we had never sinned.  What a powerful revelation.  We were transferred from the kingdom of satan into God’s kingdom of light and love with a noble inheritance awaiting us.
So beautiful these two animals loving each other ! Thank you for loving this baby and giving this kitty a wonderful life 💖
Piedino in italian means small feet actually. Get your facts right Sharon. He and his husky buddy are immensely sweet, no mistakes about that!
❤️❤️
they look like my cat poemangrannet
So cute
ZAH-RA
His name would be incorrect for the wording order changes from English to Italian so “PiediNo” can’t be the translation of “NoFoot\footless”, BUT “Piedino” is an actual diminutive term that means _little foot_  , which is *very cute* :))).
Ugh, I love this interaction
Nothing but 😘😘😘🥰🥰😁✌️
I eish you woud mother meee! hehe :)
Aww, so cutw! I just want to eat it up :)
Bless them. They were meant to be. 😻❤🐶
Sharon is a sweetheart. Thank you.
How precious is this video and this amazing dog and her kitty. Thank you for saving this special kitty. 🤗❤
She's the doggy glue that holds them all together,  that's what they do...God love the babies
That's one calm Husky 🐶
Thekitty looks like chimuelo. so cute.
@1:53 She used her eyes asking if he was gonna be o.k 😇  She was really concerned❤
Every the dodo video make me want to pet a animals
May all human blessings be visited upon you and Sharon for your incredibly huge heart and immense compassion.
I'm definitely not crying  😢
You do realize, Piedino is Sharon’s son. She has clearly mothered him from the day she saw her boy.
🙏🙏🙏❤️❤️❤️
I'm so glad you got him healthy. You can tell he was uncomfortable until after the amputation. And yes, your husky is adorable too.
🥰🙏❤
0:35 The rolling while hissing. My heart
1:52 *those eyes*
Blep
Loved how PiediNo warmed up to Sharon. Not right away, but Sharon knew he needed her. So happy for this kitty, you definitely did what was best for him. Thanks.
Why oh why can't people be more like these two.
She is so gentle even when he is tackling her  Smooshes cat
That cat would make a perfect tripod for my camera. 👌
Lovely people.
When my dog was little we was a fluffy fur ball
Thank you so much for rescuing this cat.  Not everyone would give him a chance.
It's cute also because in italian the word "piedino" means small foot... Piedi No it's something like No Feet, but in italian we say Senza Piede, that means without a foot.
Those emerald green and icy blue are just so amazing
so beautiful!
You are an awesome person Sharon knew what to do and that was pretty cool I'm glad you kept that kitten he is awesome
❤
God love you and your  two blessings.
This is so beautiful. Thank you to and husky for taking care of the kitty ❤️ I have a cat who was also so small and now she is a fearless and curious kitty.
❤️
The hissing as a kitten got me, lol so brave
If I ever saw someone raise their voice in the general direction of PiediNo ; I would proclaim that they came from a bloodline of cowards then challenge them to duel.
We get more than we give.
I love people that are good to animals.
They both are beautiful and gorgeous animals!!🥰🥰
ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL,  YOU WERE SO PATIENT WITH HIM AND SO COMPASSIONATE AND MUCH LOVE. BLESS YOU ALL, AND I WISH YOU ALL GREAT HEALTH.🥰😇💚💙💜
So beautiful ! thank you for sharing this with us! One Love 💕
Tears always for me, when i see this
PiediNo is too precious for this world🥺
We need more of this kinda love right now.

Thank you my rescue angel❤️
Thanks for the feel-good moment.
Wow , that so amazing how this sweet Mama Husky took baby kitten under paw . Now they have a very special bond that you know will last lifetime.
"Piedino" in Italian also means "small foot". Cute name for a cat :D
Wow! what an adorable dog. Wow amazing.
Thank you for this beautiful story!
🥰
This story gave me tears but it was tears of joy. That little kitten who had no foot grew to be a wonderful playmate for the dog. That's why I love this channel so much. Thank you for your heartwarming story, ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
Huskies are such great caregivers when they do care. I would be a little afraid of introducing a little kitten with their high prey drive but this Husky seems to understand.
🥲🥲
you are the champions !!
Thank you for adopting such a beautiful kitty.  As a Tuxedo boy I'm sure he will give you lots of love and cuddles.  His relationship with Sharon is so sweet.
how nice.  us humans would be a lot more sad with out our dear pets.  God bless all good people. ❤❤
SO AMAZING THE LIFE GOD GIVES US!  THANK YOU FATHER 🙏❣
SWEET PAIR ♡☆♡
God bless them two for finding each other. ❤️🥰🥰
Piedino is that special kitty ! Never a "cat" always a "kitten" ! Now the kitty has a BUDDY ! GOD BLESS YOU PIEDINO and your family ! Thanks for caring and sharing !!
If your were going Italian I think you missed a golden opportunity by not naming him treppiedi (tripod)
Such a wonderful dog for taking care of that beautiful little kitty. What wonderful people for taking in the poor little guy. Thank you for loving him.
This one was amazing
That was so sweet, no I'm not crying.
That husky is the quietest one I have met yet. (I’ve only met about 3-4)
Looks like "No Foot" found a great home 😀
Ag shamepies the baba ☺️ You guys are absolute angels 😇 for saving him 🙏 🙏 🤗the world needs more people like you 😊 🙏
i 💕this kudos doggy
Lol cute battles
That warms my heart
I love Piedino and gorgeous Husky !!!💚💖💚💖💚💖😸🐶. Thank you Eleonora 🙏👼🌺☺...
a couple of months after my neighbor's cat lost a leg she was horrified when she saw her husband tossing the cat at a tree. after she stopped screaming at him he looked hurt and said "physical therapy" she would need to be able to protect herself, and he was actually being quite gentle, and she did learn how to climb trees with 3 legs
So cute. I hope the little kitty is no longer in pain and only thriving.
That's cat is so lucky
Unfortunately a Pit Bull killed the cat and the Husky tried to protect and also perished.
Petty Ho  Edit: whut  a slut
Oh my god what a awesome sweet story
I love his name. What a couple of sweet lucky babies. ❤️❤️
is it wrong to say i absolutely love dogs and cats more than human beings?
Bless you
Your kitty looks like my two with the little white spot on their lips. Adorable
🥰🐾🐾🐾🐾😭
I have had 2 different 3-legged cats.  It did not slow them down a bit.  First day home from the hospital they were running around.  I don't think they even noticed it.  One was missing a front leg and one a back leg.
Their relationship is so touching💙. Gosh I love animals😊.
❤️❤️❤️
Italian here saying that is a non existent word. Bloody Yanks.
I know this isn’t the point, but “Sharon” is a hilarious name for a dog.   “WHAT’S IN YOUR MOUTH SHARON? DROP IT! SHARON, QUIT CHEWING UP MY UNDERWEAR!”  (Neighbors all down the street going “wtf? 🤨🤯🤯”)   Funny story time, if you’ve got a spare minute or two. We used to live in a townhouse and hear the couple next door fighting all the time. The lady would go off yelling like “dammit John! It’s like you never listen. You never used to be like this, and now you’re so stubborn! Get the hell off my bed! Right. Now. No, not even the couch tonight. You can sleep on the kitchen floor and think about how you’ve been acting lately.” And my then-gf and I would be like “jeez John, stand up for yourself! Nobody should disrespect you like that day after day!” We knew from (separate) past experiences, that calling 5-0 when DV is involved can often heighten the situation to dangerous levels, unless it’s handled expertly. So we’d go out often, hoping to catch him alone getting the mail or on a run or something to discreetly check in/offer resources if he wanted them.   But we never saw a husband. Just the lady walking a cocker spaniel.   Yes. Yes, you already know what we didn’t for months. That cocker spaniel was none other than John.   We learned this as she tugged the leash and said “John! Quit it! Gross, that’s random poop! Heel, John!”  The realization hit like a truck, and we both laughed until no sound came out and laughed some more.  So I love to imagine this lady standing at her back door like “Sharon! Quit screwing around with tennis balls! You gotta let No-Foot lay on your stomach!”  (For the record, because I know people are gonna bring it up: it’s a funny story, but it’s not cool to yell at your dog like that. I don’t at all condone the behavior. But otherwise, she more than met John’s needs - and you can’t very well remove a dog just bc their owner is a c-u-next-Tuesday.)   Anyway, I adore Sharon and her tripod buddy. That tiny lil hiss attempt at the beginning was awesome.
I try not to let myself see too much animal suffering,  as it utterly decimates me in my old age... but this story was so special... of course animals feel as deeply as we do... they have other words,  with their expressions, and actions... what a beautiful story! Thank you for sharing!:-)
Down right Shakespearian in its pathos; a reflection or lesson on co-existence, be human or canine or feline.  Cheers.
So heartwarming
I have a tuxedo male cat named Buddy. I consider him as my best friend. Watching your video just now made my day!! 🤗❤🐱 🐕 I love all cats and dogs!!

These are beautiful stories in such terrible times!
Best channel on YouTube
I'll never stop being amazed with how dialed in dogs really are... They just know stuff we don't and it's wonderful... I love dogs... (and my cat lol)
💕🙏💐❤️💚💜😇🍀🍀🍀🍀🍀🍀🍀🍀✨🙏😇🍀💜💚❤️✨
What a beautifully kind and caring family you are, you have given this remarkable kitty everything possible to have s joyous life in a loving family!  Sharon is so phenomenally kind, gentle and patient with the kitty and their bond is so very special.  Thank you for sharing your beautiful family animals, they bring joy into the lives of viewers, as does your caring for extremely vulnerable animals.
Love
I love tuxedo cats like this
That concern in his eyes said it all. There is good  in the world you just have to find it where you can.
Great, loving people keep us from despare. 🤗🤗🤗
I'm not a believer, but if there is a God, this is his form of love
"No choice but to adopt"  ... yes, I knew that early in clip.. 😉😂  ♥️ and 🙏🏻 for a great life for this family from Oz👍🇦🇺
What a beautiful friendship .. love has no boundaries and I am sure kitty healed much quicker due to the love they share ❤️truly angels in fur ..
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Soulmates dont have to be from the same species!
So amazing, yoyr husky would of been lost without it after that! Thank you for choosing to keep the cat! Also this is a very very rare husky they usually are stubborn and not to affectionate. They choose a person and that's it but that could of been what it did here was choose the cat which is amazing! Even rough husky can be in packs it's actually not usually something the need.
Amazing how he gets around on 3 as if  nothing. Never lost his little saucy cait gait.
Bless you, for the care and love you give to the fur babies you care for. I agree that PiediNo and Sharon were supposed to find each other but they were to find you also. Your family's story is precious. God Bless You and Keep You.
In a time where evreyone is hurting and scared about the future, these videos really help IMO. I always find myself smiling at the end. Thank you 😊
The cat name is stupid but the story is touching.
kitten flips over while hissing. 😂😂😂
I love Huskies
true friendship has no boundaries! I had a red Siberian Husky named Meko {2001-2014} looked just like Sharon but a little more orangey - PEACE LOVE n HIPPYNESS ✌💗☮
So sweet 😍🥰
In the modern world, it seems to me that many people are elevating animals to the same level as humans.
1. You're pronouncing Piedino wrong 2. Piedino is Italian for "presser foot" not "no-foot"
I was stationed in Italy back in ‘the day’ and we adopted 2 sib kittens from a family that was transferring out, Mezzanotte  and Tigre, and I’m sure you can tell by their names, one was 100% black and his brother was a classic tiger.   Such great pets.
I literally started crying. Who says cats and dogs can’t get along 😭😭😭
🙏
Some things are just beyond comment  ❤
Too cute and precious  ..must protect.
Thanks
Thank you for taking such good care of kitty. The husky is a doll.
I've had two cats who were missing a rear leg. They got around just fine.
love the cat though!
PiedNo and Sharon are adorable
guys Piedino means “little foot”
Sworn enemies yeah right
Once two animals bond like that, you gotta keep them together 😌
Lovely 🥰 animals
God bless you billion time for saving poor disable very cute kitten PiedieNo  thank you  very much you are angel kind and hero .your dog is so sweet l like the  wonderful friendship betten him and PiediNo l will  pray for the kitten 🐕🐈🐈‍⬛💋🌹💓🐕🦮💔💔💝🌷🌺🐈💋🌹maybe God put his miracle on him l mean doctor can put for him artificial paw or feet so he can walk  ran like other cats-great God bless PiediNo the dog and you Always Amen
Wonderful story ❤️
This is why it’s so important to take your cat to the vet if they start reacting like PiediNo at 1:26 out of nowhere! If a cat starts hiding, growling, not wanting to be touched it’s a sign that something is wrong not that they “suddenly hate you” or they’re mad at you or something.
Keep inside at night from coyotes
Please keep animal inside at night so coyotes don’t get them
Piedino doesn't mean "no foot", it means "little foot" in Italian.
Absolutely Heroes!!!!
❤️❤️❤️
Heartbreaking and beautiful! Thank you for sharing. May you all be blessed and thrive! ❤ 🐈‍⬛ 🙌
Piedino actually means "small foot".
So precious thank you for caring and loving him
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤🙏🙏🙏🙏God bless you
piedino actually means little foot not ‘no foot’
I would have never forgiven you, had you not adopted him! I mean that! They are so perfect together and for another!
That's amazing!
Both are adorable!!
Husky therapist helped kitty grow strong and loving
His eyes are beautiful
Animals bring the sun to rainy days
TUXEDO CATS ARE THE BEST SURVIVORS !!!
Your kitty looks just like my Tuxedo kitty.  She is feisty too.  I have rescued many kittens but feel unprepared to parent a cat who is definitely much smarter than her parents .  Today I found her trying to turn on the bedroom light, jumping up the wall and touching the switch but not angling quite enough to get the deed done.  They are smart and never give up. Have fun with your new precious baby.
I'm not crying your crying 😢
🥰🥰
So, So great to see this. Thank you
So precious and a lil fighter and your beautiful husky is a beautiful caring spirit💖💖💖💖💖💖💖
Piedino is so cute 😁 Sharon is so cute too 😁
❤❤❤❤
Sharon is so precious - I have never met a dog that gentle, or that invested in a kitten before. He's a cutie, much like my cat when I was growing up (such a handful!), and it's beautiful to watch them together 💞
Thank you for sharing such a wonderful story about two best buds...loved it!!
You are so generous and kind. Thank you for adopting him and giving him such a beautiful life with his other mommy Sharon! He has two mommies now! ❣️😻🐾🐈💕
cool
Thank you , for caring for the Kitty . She will be able to thrive now. Along with the beautiful and gentle Husky. You will have wonderful adventures now with your Kitty and your Husky, they were made for each other .
🥰💝💖💗💞
Thank you for being kind and caring and taking a chance on that little tiny kitten.
animals are the best therapy 😍🥰😇
What a beautiful story! Bravo on your good choices!
Wonderful !
Beautiful baby!
Animals know when you are in pain and they can feel your emotions.
thank you
Lovely !!!!  😘😘😘
Extraordinary 🙏
These videos would be so much better if there wasn't cheesy, sappy, manipulative music playing in all of them. Let the action of the people and animals speak for themselves!
Best human!
🐈🐱🍀🐈🐱🐾🐈🐱⭐🐈🐱🇧🇷
Lmao those tiny hisses
This touched my heart so deeply. Animals are natures miracle and we need to do all we can to show them love, respect and protect them.
Piedino means little foot.
Wonderfull story 😍
Special stuff right there !
Hope and love!!!!!!
Ok everyone, WE ALL need to take lessons in how to love and respect each other no matter our differences, from this beautiful relationship💗
OMG 🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲
God bless that big ball of love ❤️
I grew up with a Maine Coon cat who lost her rear leg when a horse stepped on it when she was 10 years old. The night we brought her home, we had the bed set up and we were expecting to do all kinds of care, but overnight she got up and ran all over the house. I was always amazed by how agile she was. She could beat up dogs. Her personality continued to be dominant and lovable, and she lived to be 19 years old. Her body was very muscular and strong because running on three legs involves a lot of core muscles.
Little side note: Piedino in Italian actually means "Little foot", in an endearing way (I'm italian). It fits splendidly either way 💕
Excellent!!!
Daymn those tow are adorable!
J’aime tout ce qui est dit et fait par cette si merveilleuse personne et quelle joie de voir ces deux Êtres liés par l’affection, comme ils sont beaux. 🙏🙏🙏🙏♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
So cute
Thank you for this video. Both of those babies are absolutely adorable. Also you and your family are truly fantastic people for all that love and care. Thank you,thank you!
Angels. Both of them. Angels.
The best part: piediNO is a wonderful pun, as it can be read as "piedi - no” (no foot) and as "piedino" (small foot).
Beautiful story and Soul Mates.
He looks like Toothless from HTTYD 😍 and her patience with him during his pain made me tear up.
Gracias por cuidarlos
Thank you for sharing this amazing video.   Please put updates.  It makes me smile to see your furr babies.
I hope you and your dog get the best table in heaven.
Siberian husky cat color black definetly amazing
🥲🙏💖🤗😺😊
Protect the husky cat
Just a note: PiediNo in italian means little foot not no foot at all
❤❤❤❤❤❤
0:52 weird that this was lifted from "Siamese kitten LOUDEST purring"
Trop beau 👍🤩😍😘🍀❤️💋🙏🥰
"Tripod cat" - I like that 😆 And Sharon: she really cares 🥲
What a special little family 🥰❤💝
🌻❤️👍🏻
😂
Sakaki: Its a nibbler.
Sorry girl but Piedino means small foot in italian. Even Piedi-no would be wrong because "piedi" is the plural version.
Heart warming, and So much Compassion given to the little kitten. Thank you much
I'm a fairly tough old coot, but this one made my eyes water up a bit.
....thank YOU All soooo much !!! Kinde regards from Switzerland !!!
Too much time before going to the vet😡
That was a nice video to watch. Thanks
Aww so lovely.
So glad you keep him, that should do everyone !
The old saying proven right, "Sharon is caring".
Schöne Freundschaft unter Tieren. Und schön zu sehen wie sich der Kater entwickelt hat.
The best friends
Poor little sweetheart! How can someone be so cruel to abandon such a beautiful creature! I am so happy you adopted Pidino and your husky  is incredibly sweet!!
Love, love, love!!!
This is just way too special! Thanks 😊
They are so adorable I feel like crying
The Dodo is a Great channel ♥️ There is something so special about a Sweetheart of a Dog nurturing a needy Kitten, and Sharon and Piedieno are Beautiful and have a wonderful Momma ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️🐾🐾♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
I am a fully grown man and I cried. God bless you all that help animals! Heaven awaits for those kind souls 🙏
Oh how sweet is that
1:53 Jumpscare.
God bless this family ❤️
Sharon is a sweetheart. I wish most people were as caring
What a cute little squeaker X3
❤❤❤🥰🥰🥰🥀🥀🥀❤❤❤🤩
Бог,спаси нас от зла и разрушения. Всем любви и взаимопонимания. Не ешьте животных, ведь мы их сами называем братья наши меньшие.
how sweet!!  It's a joy to see them together!
Piedino in italian: little feet.
Love stories of animals overcoming physical limitations.👍
❤️
Beautiful baby 🐈❤ thank you for the care.
Bless
Sharon is a good girl, give her the pets she deserves, and the cat too
Precious ♥️
Man this is so freaking cute, I love these two and love those white whiskers🫶🏼🫶🏼❤️❤️
Grazie 🥰🐶 super
Too precious!
Dois anjos lindos ♥️😻🐈❣️🐕🐾😍👍
Omg soooo cute I love animals keep them both safe god bless you for helping kitten
Lovely 💖... but let me tell you: in italian Piedino means Little Foot - if they really meant to give the cat that name, they should have called him No Piede, or even better Senza Piede (without foot) ☺
I love when dogs make cats part of the pack
Don’t you love kind people
Is that the best dog in the whole wide world?
They are the best so cute !
My husky had a litter and 5 out of 8 dogs died, 1 that survived is a male that was born without one of the bones in his left front leg, the mom instead of rejecting the boy, she became protective of him, we tried to fix it with surgery (as it was pointing to the inside so it was a high risk of getting caught on something and breaking) but the tension was too much and had yo be amputated (just the paw, not the full leg) now he ls a crazy happy dog with a protective mom and 2 sisters, it’s amazing how they all react if a dog tries to dominate him, maybe it’s because he is the only male, but he is brave and seeing those interactions is quite amazing
Yeah this is very familiar.  I don’t have a dog but a bunch of kittens forced their way into my home and heart by forcing their way inside my truck fan. It was brutal.  Amazingly they all lived and, Willow, my inside three legged cat, was the only major injury.  Now I’m the old cat man. Never thought that would happen.  Absolutely ridiculous.  Wouldn’t trade them for the world.
That is so sweet!!!!
We had a cat that lost a hind leg and her tail in a car accident. Within a year of bringing her home, she was running around almost as fast as the other cats and climbing trees.  Nice to see another critter not letting something get in the way. Also, that dog is a saint.
😘That's One Down B*tch!😘
😺 ❤ 🐶
💕
So happy you got the bad leg removed.  It will make it much easier for him to move around and he won't be bumping the stub all the time.  Sweet cat, sweet life.
At 02:34...the video is out of sequence because after the leg amputation, they went out on adventure walks but you could still see the bad leg still attached. This was bad editing at THE DODO.
♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
Do you have to show the CLOSE UP of butt licking... gross.. trim that stuff out...     I sure hope whatever happened to its legs was before it could really take in pain information.
They are both adorable
Foe nem tweaking @ 1:53
Oh my goodness I feel so bad!! How cute is that little kitten🥺❤️ it is definitely a blessing to have him recovered😻💕 Great work!!
What a wonderful loving dog Sharon is!  I'm so glad you adopted this darling kitty.  I think both Sharon & Piedino need each other.  And I think you needed him😻
What a wonderful family. So awesome!
S9 VERY SWEET 😋  THANKS FOR SHARING
PiediNo landed in the best human & dog family! So much love and care.💙❤💚
I am NOT crying! There's just something in my eye.
😍😍😍😍😍😍
What a special friendship!! ❤️❤️❤️
❤❤❤
2:20 I love when Piedino is attacking Sharon and she basically just lies down on top of him, and looks up like “problem solved”. LOL 😂
👏👏👏👏 Thank you and all blessings for you ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
This was just sooo precious!  So glad you all found one another and that kitty found a loving forever home!
I’m not crying.  You’re crying.
Thank you Noah for saving God’s beautiful creatures!!
Back2Basic: I would say thank YOU to my Doberman at all times i was proud of him!!, he shined!# 😆
What an amazing husky 🌈♥️. Beautiful ❣️
Such a cute little guy! 😍
I reckon the kitten is the luckiy one because you found him in the nick of time! Thanks for saving PediNo's life. Sharon did a great job too, helping out when possible!
Who's cutting onions?!?!😭😭😭😭😭🥰🥰🥰🥰
This is the cutest thing I've seen all day
Wonderful woman :)
Omg he is such a special kitty to survive not having a foot
Such a nice story.
This is a beautiful story! You are amazing and you pets are beautiful ❤️❤️
i will never understand how people can even think of hurting animals. they are the best thing on this planet!
💓💞💕❣
OMG my girl sersi has the same markings and same coat color
Mama huskies are the best - so gentle and caring. What a sweet story!
How could anyone abandon such a tiny, frail kitten like this? It breaks my heart and makes me cry. Thank you for adopting him and giving him his forever home. ♥
This is what a true love between a cat and a dog looks like.
God bless you all.
I’m not crying, YOU’RE crying
Unlike for dogs, a cat with no leg is hardly a cat. I'd just have it out down, sorry
Thankyou for adopting him ❤. They are both gorgeous 😍
That's not what it means in Italian 😂
Aww!
Animals have empathy.  Unlike humans. Probably the coolest husky I've seen in a while.  Good job. Just awesome!
Huskies are the greatest dogs!!  Sharon is a wonderful sentient being.  🌠
To all those people who will blubber, blather and bemoan that the world is terrible and there’s no hope and every ones a victim of something. Yes, there’s bad things that happen every day around the world. However, there’s far more that’s beautiful, loving, encouraging and shows that no the world is not a terrible place. There’s far more good decent, kind people doing the right thing every day than bad people doing bad things. And all the proof you need is watching this video and the hundreds of thousands like it. You don’t have to go out and try to save the world every day, all you have to do is.....what’s RIGHT. Thank you to all of you fabulous people, that wake up daily and sincerely attention to do that.
😍😍😍
That is a very lucky cat, but that husky is a saint.
Leg amputation always ends up a liberating thing. Tripods forget that they aren't supposed to have 4 legs. 🥰‼
Wow 😻🐕
He lost the same leg as my tripod kitten.  My Angel is so mischievous at times to the point he's a little devil. But I love him all the same. After a couple months of him recovering and the wound healed up he made it clear he didn't want to be inside all the time. He's a spoiled indoor-outdoor cat.
SWEET story!!!!!
How kind would you have to be to take such care of a creature that would have died otherwise. I had a hard time just handling my kids. But my wife made me keep them and now that the kids are finally gone she makes me take care of her 16 rescue dogs an 5 rescue cats. Can’t wait until they all move out. I do it because I’m forced to but this young lady does it out of kindness.  In this case angels do exist. Thank you lady
Tiny kitten hisses are so cute 😍!!
The mother probably noticed he was sick too and left him, nature is harsh
Bless you all ❤️❤️🧡🧡🧡
Love it! Thank you for caring for him.  It warms my heart.
Owning a three legged cat myself (her front left leg) I can tell you she is just like any other cat they don't know their different and I treat her like her brothers one of which is also special needs. All animals need love and affection in order to shine! And this story proves that ten times fold! Beautiful story!
My rescued kitten would sleep atop my adopted Amstaff. Love is here, just look for it✌💜🐶
Thank you.
GRACIAS  RESCATADORES POR TODO EL AMOR Y EL GRAN EJEMPLO DE VIDA QUE DAN . LES DESEO TODO LO MEJOR PARA TODA LA VIDA AMIGUITOS !!!!!
We people MUST learn from animals how to live in unconditional love, respect and peace!!!
So glad you adopted him. Thank you so much for helping him grow & heal & for him & Sharon to stay together, such a beautiful bond.. & bless you taking them on adventures 😀🤩💖
Both of them are so adoreable ❤❤❤
What a treasure...your husky is SOOOO beautiful!
KUDOS for your HUMANITY for the Voiceless........!
Those tiny hisses! ❣️💕
Thank God for people like you.💞
When the kitten gets bigger, maybe you could consult your vet about the possibility of some kind of prothesis for his missing foot, so he could get around easier.
Adorable duo ❤
I so love how the Husky doggy is so gentle towards the kitten and even so when the kitten grew. Such sweet BFF’s.👍🏼♥️🐕😺🤗💋
Almost 60k views in an hour.... 😎 Let's go DoDo!
tears of joy
Their journey will be legen… wait for it… dary
What a beautiful cat and a beautiful relationship! Just FYI, piedino does not actually mean no foot in Italian. It's something like cute little foot. (Adding "no" to the end of an Italian word does not negate it.) Piedino is a great name anyway.
please try to see if piggy back rides could be an option so they can explore together longer and share those  videos 🐕🐈🥰🥰🤗♥️♥️♥️♥️
♥️♥️♥️♥️
DODO is blessing to animalkind,..... Thank you for the sharing so many kind stories of animals who got human attention and got better life on earth..... Comparing to those stray animals
"Piedino" in italian also mean little foot, so kinda fit on both meanings
Not an eye dry...
What a special dog. ❣❤❤Sharon was made for a special duty and fulfills it well. The pet parents are special and lovely people too. Glad they found one another. I like the end when the animals go on excursions with the human family. How sweet.
Some bonds can't be explained just feeling could...
He’ a cute little typod cat 🐈‍⬛
A love story all around!😍
I  believe it's one of the most beautiful thing to watch kitten playing with husky.
)👍🏾
Love his little white murder mittens!
❤️
Soul warmer
This is why I love animals❤️
The tears won't stop, such a sweet story.
Can't miss those beautiful eyes of a husky😊😊
Guys LOL 😂 1:52 look at them WIDE EYES OPEN then oml 🥲
good people still exist in this sick world
Bless you.
I’m sorry but piedino means small foot in Italian not no foot😭😭
"Piedino" means "little foot". "Monco" means "without foot or hand".
That bebe is basically Sharon's child ❤️
Omg! I love this story’s ending! You’ve done right!
Lmao the dog is named Sharon
WHAT A COOL FAMILY!!!
Very sweet story
I love the name she gave the kitten
SooCute!!!
mom: gets a kitten Sharon: hi little one PiediNo: *tackles* hi-ya!! me: roflao
Seeing that tiny cone on that little kitty was heart wrenching!!! Midway through, I thought, "How could you NOT adopt him?". I have to admit it was a HUGE relief when you did...
I have that same cat! His name is pepper and he acts so much like piedino😸
Squeaky little baby ☺️💕
I absolutely love and adore this kitty! ❤️💯🥰
Please make sure you know Jesus Christ as your Lord and Saviour everyone! He is coming soon! Please don't be left behind! Repent and accept Jesus! JESUS LOVES YOU! John 3:16, 2 Peter 3:9, Luke 5:32, Acts 3:19, 1 John 1:9, Matthew 4:17, Mark 16 16-18, Revelation 20:15
There's nothing I feel more sympathy for than a animal that has missing limb🥺
Lucky cat..
Omg I happy video I just can’t take tear jerker .the way the huskie looked at her when the cat was recovering I could feel the trust n love
A healing story!
Js
Did someone hurt the kitten or was he born that way?
Sharon is the best girl
I cried while watching this it melted my heart to see Sharon being so loving, sweet , loyal and gentle to a tiny wounded kitten. Dogs and cats are truly the best animals to exist seeing this video really proves how loyal dogs are to their loved ones. God bless the owner, Sharon and most importantly Piedino wish you guys the best of luck.
Just beautiful.
no words needed face so much  Love involved.   Beautyfull familly
It’s amazing that 3 different species can live and thrive in a shared environment. Different languages but love and caring is understood. As humans, I wish we could apply this to each other.
This is so cute!
Beautiful story and special to see Sharon the Husky looking after the cat so well :)
Huskies are the best!!
Thank you for not giving up on Pendio 🐈‍⬛ . He was small But he has a Big heart ❤ Pendio loves his older sister Sharon  🐕. She loves her little Brother as well as they Both  love Mom.

Mimieeeeee
So cute 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
Great friendship
Whoever's reading this I pray that whatever your struggling with or worrying about is going to be fine and that every one has a fantastic day...
What a wonderful, patient Husky gal.
What do you call it when you put a big female husky and a teeny weeny little 3 legged kitten together ????? And on top of that add a good mom??................... LOVE. 😬💝.
omg those  two are darling.
Hadir nyimak saudara ku 🙏
Video of the month? Year? Ever?
This video just makes me happy.
😻🧟‍♀️
❤❤❤❤❤
Why put the glove finger on the GOOD foot? It should have been on the bad one.
This is so beautiful thanks for sharing ❤️❤️
You and no foot and Sharon are inspirational. Good fortune and health to all of you all your days. Thank you! Thank you! ♥️🥰😍💪
Too cute. I can't take it! 😆
The resilience of animals is amazing. I see so many of the vet shows where they amputate a leg andin a day or two they are walking, wagging their tail and ready to love.  And yet there are still people who mistreat animals.  Thank God their are loving people like you left in the world.  I always say. God has a special place in heaven for people like you.  And you can bet that place will be filled with all sorts of animals.
This is true love ♥️♥️♥️
Grande,,❤️❤️❤️
I took in a 3 legged wee beastie. First year was a bit dicey but my little skuttle bug is a chunker now and full of fluff and stuff lol. Hes also pretty fast and enters all rooms like Kramer from Seinfeld lmao. I have too many cats and did when I brought him home but I dont regret it for a second.
Sharon is. good thang 🐈‍⬛🌻💞
Inutile dire che gli animali sono meglio degli umani, basti vedere questo bel cagnolone, quanta delicatezza e Amore ha verso il gattino..... Grazie x averlo accolto e regalatogli una vita stupenda 🙏🏻❤❤❤❤😍😍👍🏼👍🏼
💖
Godbless
Eralyyyyy
What an sweet story❤️👍
💕🐾🐾💕
piedino means little foot - in Italian there's a work indicating someone missing a hand (monco) but no word for one missing a foot (for which we use the generic word "amputato")
😟😟😟😘😘😘😘🤗🐈😘😘😘💞👏👏🏘️💖💖💖
O my gosh..so. SWEETTT..they are so beautiful!BLESSINGS!
See, even dogs and cats don't have to be enemies. What a lesson for human beings.
What a cutie pie!
🙂🐾🐕🐈❤
I wonder what the situation was with that one leg. I'm sure they did the right thing and this is a great story. Kitten had a hard start. Thanks for seeing him through
Finding a new Dodo video is like picking summer berries. Just when you think you've got them all, another berry shows up under a leaf! 🌿🍓 I love this channel.
💜💜
Amazing so beautiful there bond n love 😻 🐕 🐈 ❤
❤️❤️❤️❤️
Who would do this to a poor kitten?! I hope they get the same treatment they did to this kitty!!! Poor baby! Glad this woman found him💞
🥺🥺
Dogs and cats show compassion that humans cannot. So happy this was a foster fail. Pedifoot and Sharon were meant to be buddies. Thank you for helping these two to live the best life. 💞
I'm so glad you have rescued that sweet little ❤ kitty 😺 ❤
Special friendships. 😁😁👋👋❤❤
Heartbreaker:[
I've always had cats and dogs at the same time and the only dogs that I've had that liked cats are the Huskys I've had.
So AMAZING, thank you for sharing!!!
If I had enough money ,I can help some cats  .... but it's  so hard for us.....
Me an italian: aww they called him little foot (adding -ino to names makes them mean the smaller version) They: we called him no foot Me: I mean, they ain't wrong
that dog is a better friend than most   humans
Beautiful video...May God bless you always
ALL creatures great and small, the Lord God made them ALL.  Thank you from the bottom of my HEART.
Ohhhhhh❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
🥰❤
He's a big fighter cat! He has a kindred spirit in Cassidy, the Miracle Kitty of Tinykittens, both survivors and just as awesome as any other four footed feline :)
1:54 ... his gorgeous face getting a thumb stroke.
That little hiss 🤣
😍
This is  true love
Thank you. He's Beautiful
What a sweet husky sharon is.
:)  Don't forget to remember that none of this would have happened without *you,* Ms. Burke.  :D
Sharon as a husky name tickled me, she is a lovely sweet mom to a dear, little needy kitten. These two are a match and I’m so glad the kittens forever home is with the only family it’s ever known.💕
My god he is beautiful cute lil no foot
So nice Together
Piedino means small foot .....
They are both sweet brothers who have a special bond. It's beautiful watching cats and dogs become best friends.
You had me at Hello! 👼❤️🙏🏼❤️‍🔥👼
So beautiful these two animals loving each other ! Thank you for loving this baby and giving this kitty a wonderful life 💖
Beautiful Dog for that Kitten.

Really made me mad when she was petting that cat while he was growling and hissing. Leave him alone!!!! You are not soothing him. He is TELLING you he is scared and hurt and doesn't want you touching him. Goodness he looks so upset, how horrible. It makes YOU feel better, not him. For him it is torture. Growling, biting, flat ears and whiskers, lashing tail, how many more ways could he have told you to stop touching him?
So sweet to see animals grow and be loved through out their life , unfortunately not all have this opportunity😢
Everthing is Purrfect ..
Protect your husky at all costs, she is a national treasure..... Why are they both so adorable

You are one of these youtubers those put pride flag to their pfp but after pride month they just disappear. That's not very nice from you ☹︎
Tooo heartwarming
Your videos are amazing ❤️
There’s nothing more precious than a teeny tiny kitten who hisses at you! I had a 2 day old kitten hiss at me and my heart melted.
