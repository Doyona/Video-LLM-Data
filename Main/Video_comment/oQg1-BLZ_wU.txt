Arright immaculate beauty featured alongside the pg for the storyline, & for eric iv, & holy, one sexy feature artist, & well we all knew the pg is a chameleon, slides into any new genre with ease, kills it. Reminds me of oldschool late 90's early 2000's r&b.  Fabulous, 50, nelly. Immediate classic 👌
