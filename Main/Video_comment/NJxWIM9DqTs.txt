Im so glad they broke up
Is it js me or am I the type to try making 1 drop leave the bottle but then the table starts drowning😭
Kids who don’t have any water: 💀
That was so mean of him
He snapped like crazy. He saw how the video was going to end and then he went fast. He went for it and that switch up was also crazy. He went from being calm to being crazy that’s insane.😂

“And that is how we broke up”

If you’re here after the breakup😢😢 👇
If you want to do that again to make sure whoever steals put a paper towel under the cup
Why did you do that
To think them not together
We will never know why he gave her up😢
Who’s watching this after the breakup
Cheating from him, Katie you should put 10 cups over his head.
Me playing this game in summer:(pours as much as I can)
POV: you are watching this when they broke up

I feel so bad for you!💖 lol😂
I would never spill freezing water on me just for a game and by the way that was funny how he just threw the water at her😂

Sean was like ( in his mind) - lets dump the water on her before she makes an excuse🤣
Rude
Unhealthy Relationship RED FLAGS All over the place I this video. Karie, Please dont ever get married to this  guy. Trust Me when I say I would loved to have someone with experience in a mentally abusive relationship and got out successfully got out of it, would have told me to step back before I was almost 15 years in.
Katie spilled it literally almost every single time😂
Sean actually spilled it first because he spilled it on Katie
His laugh on the end tho-😂😂😂
Annoyed how childish someone can be he spilt it first and emptied it on her when she did it after it took about 5 times after he did it for them to actually say it spilt 😂😂😭
Lol
He spilled it first actually
At the end I saw that coming
That was so disrespectful
“You obviously haven’t been in science class”  -Sean
When you point out a tiny bit of water then you spil some water and say it dosent count
SEAN!!!!!!!!!!!!
I hate him
Hey dude I know you're trying to play but that's not how we played that's rude
Aww it was so wholesome ❤️
too easy.
Where did Shawn go I haven’t seen him in any of her videos in a while 🤔
Did it spill? Or he dident want to get spilled.If he dident want to thats cheating but if he played fair and she spilled it- its ok ✋
I like scary
Sean spilled it he cheated
Kids pouring water then wanting to walk in them be like:
That is not nice
It's not fair he wanted to when so that's not fair you got to take turns

I love when ______ wins and _______ lose im so sorry for ______ and the face that _____ is so funny xD
The end  L😂 L
I would smack my BF, if he did that, to me.  Probably break up, too.  That's just not cool!  No matter how much it was agreed upon, the losing party would still be pissed.  Don't pretend you wouldn't.   It's not funny, to dump water on people.  I like to have fun, but I hate stuff like this.
sean cheated

Finally the girl loses
This is called surface tension
He should have been the one who got soaked.  He spilled it, insisted on the technicality, then tried to call her on the same technicality for the rest of the video.  What a cheat...
Sean and Katie are like IT DOESNT count
I called it i 100% knew he will do that 😂
Am i the only one getting bad vibes i mean that really wasnt funny at the end
That cold ain’t it
Ayo😳
He looks like pasey from dawsons creek

My Anxiety every time they pour the water : 📈📈📈
He just pours it casually!
He is such a savage u poor thing 😆😬
I think I saw a tiny dot of water going  down😂
Katie you deserve it lol
I always thought she would get it but when she didn’t my heart literally broke :(
R.I.P
Yall must be super boref
Aww poor katie she did not even spill anything
If i had to describe katie in 5 words that start with e it would be: (I know this is kinda random) 1. EXCITING! 2. Empathetic 3. Extravagant 4. Extra amazing 5. Extra kind
She was probably so mad
his Face before he threw it on her was hilarious 😂😂😂
Idc if he is the right guy for u Katie he’s mean

I love how katie is making a exscue saying its not cheating XD
I love the end 😂
She pours a little bit and he pours more for her sake because he's a gentleman. Oops, what happened at the end?
If I was Katie I would have smacked him

Ice bucket challenge back?  My childhood
Water has hydrogen bonds which makes it attracted to itself. That’s why it has such a high surface tension
Scary to marry this kind of guy

Jojo's bizzare adventure

D' Arby vs Joseph be like
Too easy
Please come to God and be saved. We need to know that we are saved because times are getting harder and eternity is what is important. But God cares. Tomorrow is uncertain. But God is in control and even though out sins have created chaos and separated us from God, we can still be saved. If we ask God into our lives sincerely, he can be our God and Father  If we repent, we can be forgiven. If we are Baptized into a Church that truly follows the Bible(and we have to make sure we that we are following it as the Church)we can have our sins washed away and we can be given a new life. And if we do all these things and do God's will(and we can know it is his will through The Bible and the Holy Spirit, if we test the Spirits)and put our faith in Jesus Christ, we can be saved from hell and have everlasting life with God in Heaven! God is love and Jesus is the only way to be saved. It may be hard at times, but God can do anything and we can find hope and peace and Grace and mercy and even forgiveness for many horrible sins in him. Please, come to God today and know that you are saved in him, and follow him because he can give us new and more fulfilling life, and even give us a future in Heaven. May God bless you and lead you in the Truth! 🙂
The end

Lmaoo

Lmfao
No Sean spilled first ı saw look close to Sean's side
Ever watch Jojo’s bizarre adventure?
When he dumped water on her her face expression was Hilarious
Is that a Jojo reference
Who she
SURFACE TENSION...
Its spelling
She was right the first time when she said he spilled because it happened on the side of the glass to her side and he denied without dignity.  What a shame
Waste of water bruh
Stay strong 💪
Did you know that Jesus died for your sins and you can go to heaven by trusting that Jesus died for your sins
Did you know that Jesus died for your sins and you can go to heaven by trusting that Jesus died for your sins
She didn't notice
bro she should have done it outside the forest facing the sun so the water would evaporate
His laugh is so annoying
Final interaction.
Like it’s not a puddle forming at the bottom of the cup
IT JUST GAVE ME AN HEART ATTACK WHEN YOU TOOK THE GLASS AND POURED ALL THE WATER IN HER :(
It do spill
The table under the glass is wet af but yeah sure no spill
L boyfriend
Jojo fans = 🤦🏾‍♀️🤦🏾‍♀️🤦🏾‍♀️
😂😂
Oh man I want cold water now lol
🤣🤣🤣🤣
😂 lol
She deserved it lol. She spilled it like 3 times
I don't know them
not a simp
I'm sorry but he is rude you obviously never been in science class like science is my favorite subject and I don't see you there
they should have pritted a paper around the glass to see if it gets wet
tbf she actually did spill it first 😂
🤣🤣🤣🤣
D'arby would take that gamble
Them having fun: Me an environmentalist: BRO WHAT A FREAKING WASTE OF WATER!!!! LIKE WHY?????
Idiot tik Tockers
She did not even spill the water dam
I THOUGHT IT WAS EMPTY😂
We not gonna talk about the puddle of water on the table
Ice cold water sounds refreshing rn.
🤣🤣 omg why did that scare me I backed up from the phone 😭
Jee advance 2020 question
Haha
All i can think about is the episode in jojos bizarre adventure with the bet mr.joestar made and the game he was playing with the water tension
He really just snatched it up
The cup has an invisible hole in it 😬
Ayo isn’t this the mango chick
It’s spilling but it didn’t hit the table
Hj
You've never been to a science class Also him: it's never gonna spill
With coins would be cooler
In France we call that « la goute d’eau qui fait déborder le vase
Fr now, is that a Jojo reference?
You spilled it🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Love how he just typed it all over her🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Surface tension 😉
it's a classic game called surface tension. but we be using coins instead of water
Imagine if both of you two pored all of the water and it didn’t even spill
Wait but he touch the cup so he spilled it 1st
Okay ! How many times should it spill actually ?
For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son so that whosoever believeth in him shall not perish but have everlasting life - John 3:16🙏❤️✝️

Cheater girls rule boys drule
It’s not ice cold if it doesn’t have ice
Now fill it with coins
They should’ve done this by dropping coins in that would’ve been funny I think
“How to not simp”
His energy is weird af lol.
he sounds like finneas o’connell
This reminds me of that scene from jojo’s bizarre adventure
He cheated
Lol
Just goes to show you how pathetic I am for wasting my life watching you do that
Can I just say the glass was an inverted mirror

Dumbasses doing it with cold water that will pull the water from the top…
The reason it doesn’t spill is because the water is constantly evaporating

To the person reading this: even tho I don’t know you, I wish of you the best of what life has to offer ❤️

LMAO WHAT A SAVAGE
He’s mean
RUDE
If you bowing down to wicked/ corrupt systems of this world you’re trying to save your life, and will eventually lose it!  Luke 9 [23] And he said to them all, If any man will come after me, let him 💥(deny himself), and take up his cross daily, and follow me.   [24] For (whosoever will save) his life shall lose it: but whosoever will lose his life for my sake, the (same shall save it).🔥🙌🏽
The bored life
I am watching till the end

The Gospel of Salvation/Warnings  JESUS CHRIST is the only Lord and Savior this whole creation needs. Please turn to Jesus Christ and get saved now while his grace is still merciful for he is coming soon!   John 3:16 “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life”.  Isaiah 45:18  “For this is what the Lord says— he who created the heavens, he is God; he who fashioned and made the earth, he founded it; he did not create it to be empty, but formed it to be inhabited he says: “I am the Lord,     and there is no other”.   Deuteronomy 32:39 “See now that I myself am he!     There is no god besides me. I put to death and I bring to life,     I have wounded and I will heal,     and no one can deliver out of my hand”.   Philippians 2:8-11 “And being found in human form, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross. Therefore God has highly exalted him and bestowed on him the name that is above every name, so that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father”.   JESUS CHRIST WAS GOD IN THE FLESH; Son of God.   John 1:1-5 “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was with God in the beginning. Through him all things were made; without him nothing was made that has been made. In him was life, and that life was the light of all mankind. The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it”.  John 1:14  “The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us. We have seen his glory, the glory of the one and only Son, who came from the Father, full of grace and truth”.   How to get SALVATION (be saved):  1. Admit that you are a sinner. Romans 3:32   “For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God”.  Romans 6:23  “For the wages of sin is death”.  2. Believe that Jesus paid for your sin at the cross. Romans 5:8  “But God demonstrates His own love for us: while we were still sinners, Christ died for us”.  Romans 6:23  “but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus”.  Ephesians 2:8-9 “For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God—not by works, so that no one can boast.”   3. Confess that Jesus is the Son of God, and commit your life to him.  Romans 10:9  “That if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved”.    4. Repent (What does repent mean and do? To repent is a change of mind, that leads to a change of heart, that leads to a change in actions. This “change” involves both a turning from sin and a turning to God.) Luke 13:3  “But unless you repent, you too will all perish”.  Acts 3:19  “Repent, then, and turn to God, so that your sins may be wiped out, that times of refreshing may come from the Lord”.  2 Peter 3:9  “The Lord is not slow in keeping his promise, as some understand slowness. Instead he is patient with you, not wanting anyone to perish, but everyone to come to repentance”.   Once you come to Salvation then comes baptism. (Baptism is an act in which symbolizes one’s renewal/purification and becomes a child of God with the power of the Holy Spirit through water, whether the water is poured on to the forehead or one’s body is immersed into it. This symbolizes the death of our flesh with Christ and our new life through Jesus by the power of the Holy Spirit.)  Acts 2:38 Peter replied, “Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins. And you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.”  Galatians 2:20  “ I have been crucified with Christ and I no longer live, but Christ lives in me. The life I now live in the body, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me.”  Galatians 3:26-27 “So in Christ Jesus you are all children of God through faith, for all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ.”  1 Peter 3:21  “And this water symbolizes baptism that now saves you also—not the removal of dirt from the body but the pledge of a clear conscience toward God. It saves you by the resurrection of Jesus Christ.”  WARNINGS!!! Anyone who does not have Jesus Christ will always be condemned and their righteous deeds are like filthy rags.   Romans 1:8 “There is therefore now no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus, who do not walk according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit”.  Isaiah 64:6 “All of us have become like one who is unclean, and all our righteous acts are like filthy rags; we all shrivel up like a leaf, and like the wind our sins sweep us away”.   Do not worship/sacrifice to other gods; you will only bring harm to yourself.   Jeremiah 25:6 “and do not go after other gods to serve them and to worship them, and do not provoke Me to anger with the work of your hands, and I will do you no harm”.   Deuteronomy 8:19  “It shall come about if you ever forget the Lord your God and go after other gods and serve them and worship them, I testify against you today that you will surely perish”.  1 Corinthians 10:20  “No, I imply that what pagans sacrifice they offer to demons and not to God. I do not want you to be participants with demons”.   TAKE HEED NOW!!! Jesus Christ wants you to have a personal relationship with him. He cares and loves you more than his own life that he gave it up for you to be saved. Jesus Christ is the ultimate sacrifice for all mankind; to atoned away all of our sins with his precious life and blood, that we may share in his Kingdom (1 John 2:2 “He is the propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only but also for the sins of the whole world”).  Jesus Christ is not about being religious but to be in unity with him and allow him to deliver you from the bondage that this sinful body (flesh) is doomed for; eternal hell (John 3:36 “Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life; whoever does not obey the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God remains on him”).  Only through Jesus Christ will you ever get to heaven (John 10:9 “I am the door. If anyone enters by me, he will be saved and will go in and out and find pasture”). Seek Jesus Christ only: no other gods can save you from God’s wrath. God’s wrath is not a joke or to be taken lightly (Hebrews 10:31 “It is a dreadful thing to fall into the hands of the living God”). Remember he is our Creator and all things are possible with him (Matthew 19:26).   May God bless you and soften your heart to discern the truth that is in Christ Jesus, the Lord of Lords and King of Kings; the Savior of this world!!!.

You can see the meniscus

Water displacement...the tiny amount you pour on is the tiny amount that will drip down the side then surface tension kicks back in
Why does this girl always end up in my youtube shorts? Never blocked a youtuber, but i guess its time to 😬😬
😂 she acted like she didn’t spilled it. He was like yeah! You did 😆
Oh it's a prank  Well done 👏👏👏
I was afraid he was going to spill it on her in the end 😂
OK if kind of funny
"And thats how we broke up"

I love how the person filming the challenge or whatecer is so overly confident that the other person is gonna lose, and then they lose, their face is priceless and they look so mad that it didnt turn out the way they wanted it to

Why do i see shane west?

Jotaro
Is this a Jojo reference?!
cool
I would've just drank it tbh no one would pass on an ice cold drink
How much you wanna bet that a fight happened after the camera stopped! 😂
jojo reference
🐐
I had spilled didn't anyone else see the water go down the clear glass come on???
😂😂😂
How the fuck does this have 800+ likes?
🤣
More of an "overflow" challenge that they mean they're doing, I think. Imo, it spilling would be dumping too much in to shoot it out of the glass, where them pouring tiny amounts is it just overflowing off the sides of the glass, so there's no loss to the spill one if they're just pouring the tiny amounts
Some parts were kinda cut out so that doesnt count
Who else thought about JOJOS
I can guess that this wasn’t planned before
Me bottling up my feelings
Then ending was funny
Lol
Him: This video is turning to shit, how do I save it
Damn these tiktok are wasting water
That looks like sum good water went to waste
Hi
u should be droping coins in it

I mean there's people that would really need that water
haha nice man won women los
This made me thirsty lol
So who is joseph and whos darby
They both lost so fast though, why y'all gotta cheat like that when there's visible water drips down the side of the glass? :')
The beauty of patience 😂😂
Is it possible to learn this power 🧐🧐🧐🧐🧐🧐🧐🧐🧐🧐🧐🧐🧐🧐🧐
I would do the same
aren't you supposed to put in coins instead of poring water
Water: **leaks**  Him: *tHaT dOeSnt couNT it DiDnt SpilL*
Y’all better drink that fucking water
Alternate title : how to waste water
How about just drink the water bottle
Theyre pouring so much lol
They do be messin with the laws of gravity and physics and stuff I dunno but they messin with some sheet 😂
Yall keep talking ab surface tension.. no fucking shit but shes literally spilling it every time she pours water
She’s a baddie
That looks like slme good ice cold water
Put a small bit of chocolate under the glass then it looks like it will spill take time and let the sun melt the chocolate so you win
Go ahead, mister joesturrr
Her: “ it didn’t spill yet” Him: decides to dump it on her anyway  Edit: guys Ik it spilled anyway I wasn’t trying to make anyone offended I was just trying to make a joke sorry if I offended anyone :)
My anxiety rn 📈📈📈📈📈📈
Wheres the ice, how do we know its cold?!?!
This man is my idol
You can tell he’s wanted to do that for a long time lol.
*am I the only one thought there wasn't water in the cup until they started pouring?*
Ahhh the day they broke up
Foggy bottles just make me thirsty 😂
I think it's funny that it took them a minute to realize that with those rules it will never spill
The Walter flows down there my God
Lol
Frausters😯
1:54
It’s spilling every time because of the condensation on the side of the glass. For this to REALLY work you would need warm water and a plastic cup.
They don't know what surface tension is
I was like staying in my mind spill it on your girlfriend and then when I saw him do it I'm like oh yeah
🙄🙄
That would be nice in 110 F.
She can’t even pour right
Do it but instead of adding water add coins instead
Jean spilled it actualy so do it katie
And somewhere in Africa they’re some poor dying kids craving for that water.
We would've thrown hands

To tell the truth he did lose because in the back of the cup you can see it was falling down on the cup
I mean she did spill it, watch closely👀
Surface tension

Surface tension do be sEgGsY
“Well then it’s not ever gonna spill.” Starts hitting her
Nice... wasting water
Drop some coins instead 😈
Why are people saying she spilled first? He clearly did and then denied it. 😂
If anybody took chemistry they would know that a hydrogen bond is incredibly strong and that’s why the water can go over the glass without having it spill over is cause of how strong the hydrogen bond is.
There's a piece of chocolate underneath the glass
THIS IS A JOJO REFERENCE
Is was spill

Lol there sould have been a paper towel under the glass to spot spill
she was too bad to be his girl, right?
Dude her first go spilled 🤣
This is stupid the Africans need that water...think of jabombom
Friend: "And why did she break up with you?" Him: "W A T E R, yep"
At the 1st sec the girl spilled it lol
She spilled it I saw it go over the side
Is it against the rule to drink from the glass before adding more water?
That was mean
I would have broken up with him on the spot if it was my boyfriend . And have him hell if it was my brother .
That’s what we call “Surface tension” that’s also why water feels like concrete when hit from a high place.
She deserved it
"It didnt hit the table though" well it WILL if you give it time
Is that a jojo refrence
She’s literally been spilling it the whole time lmao
she deserved that lmao
She deserved that she was cheating
Scary
“It never spilled” Puddle under cup keeps getting larger
God Is Good .
If the boyfriend got splashed: *Girlfriend laughs out loud for the whole day.* If the girlfriend got splashed: *”THAT’S IT! NO SEX FOR YOU FOR THE WHOLE MONTH!”*
😎😎😎😎😖😖😖😭😭😭😚😚🤪
☹️☹️☹️☹️

Everyone else: worried about water already on the table around the cup  Me: I'm waiting to see people chuckle about the pronunciation of the word "condensation".
If you live in Arizona you’d never pass up the opportunity to get splashed with cold water

Feel free to waste water you dont have to worry

Never gonna spill! *sees it spilling literally each time*
I wanted to see who would  spill it
Not him spilling it first💀🤚
Y'all a bunch of cheaters, lmao
she was doing the smallest ours ever he did bigger puts so it’s kinda fair
Realisticially the condensation on the glass is gonna break surface tension of the water in minute amounts making it tough to tell when a “spill” occurs
Lessgo y’all not fake
jojo reference
Imagine he just picked up the table and smashed her over the head with it .   YOU SPILLED…
Ахуеное мужик! Так и надо ей! Молодец
Im mean technically in the end she did 😀
"It didn't hit the table!" meanwhile table is drowning

*Jojo has enter the chat
Jojo be Darby????
'a bottle of ice cold water" if it's ice cold then it's ice humanity is just going to die saying something dumb

Joseph joestar
Jojo reference???
🤣
In this weather, I'd mess up on purpose.
Gaha
Just go play Jenga
Ppl need water and this man over here with his gf is wasting delicious ice cold water u should be ashamed tsk tsk tsk
Should have done it with warm water to stop the condensation on the glass, the surface tension of the water was hitting the drops of condensation ..........Science ............
She had the perfect movie “I just got soaked” face
And this is how they discovered surface tension... Good job guys 😃
ain’t no one gonna notice there’s a literal puddle of water under the cup. and they said ‘iT dId NoT hIt tHe tAbLe’
Water displacement says it goes out of cup right down the cup because that’s the path of least resistance on to the table wasting water woooooooooow love to watch them end it tho
Duffy dizzy crush cystic Dixon focus rests a uniformity six
You must be very bored.
that was stupid
Me trying to add more soda into my cup without overflowing it
No, that's not funny.
Fun fact this trend was made to try to trick they're s/o who don't drink enough water
Surface tension
They had a whole puddle on the table.
This is how me and my brother split snacks, whoever spills it first gets the smallest piece of the chocolate bar.
How romantic
Reminds me of that one episode of JJBA in part 3 with that gambling game.
I see the water literally spilling ..... this whole timeeeee
This is a jojo reference
"It didn't hit the table though." That's... Not how that works
Bro if someone did this to me we would’ve had to fight

https://youtu.be/8VwiC-IJi7U
Water is truly an amazing thing
That’s what she gets for spilling 500 times and thinking that it didn’t count
Everyone know Jesus loves us and He died for us and you can become one of His followers. Ask if you have questions
He is soooo rude!
Technically he spilled the water.. ;)

U meed a shot cup in the water
Wasting water... what idiots
Go ahead mr. Joestar
it could be a loop to troll everyone
Different types of sins are lying, stealing, coveting, using God’s name in vain, dishonoring your parents, looking at someone with lust, having other idols/god(s) beside God, and more. You can’t be a good person to get into Heaven because you have already sinned at least once and there is no work YOU specifically can do in order to be saved. Sin is so serious in God’s eyes because sin the cause of all pain, suffering, and death. Yet God STILL sent His Son Jesus to willing die on the cross for all OUR sins and rose from the dead three days later because God loves us soooo much. If you repent (to change your mind and recognize that God exists and that Jesus Christ is the Lord our God and Savior), turn to God, and trust in God that He will save you ONLY because of what JESUS DID for us on the cross and rose 3 days later (“by grace you have been saved through faith, and know that of yourselves; it is a gift of God, not of works, less anyone should boast.” -Ephesians 2:8-9) ,then God will save you from your just punishment of hell and give you the gift of eternal life with Him! After you have been saved, make sure to turn away from and forsake all your sins (but don’t just say you wanna stop sinning, actually make a change. Otherwise your are playing the hypocrite. And you can only make a change with God’s help and strength, ask Him for it), live for God for your entire life, and always love God more than anyone or anything! God DOES NOT hate you, GOD LOVES YOU and wants to SAVE YOU!!! And don’t wait either because you can die tomorrow, tonight in your sleep, or even in the next hour! And once you have died and you haven’t repented and turned to God, it’ll be too late. God loves you more than you can even understand and He is always waiting for you to come to Him!
The boy a sweat
XD LOL

Couldn't they use a re useable bottle?

That look so cold and good
Side note its been spilling the entire time. Look at the table near the cup
We’re literally watching it overflow over and over and they just keep going
Lol I was honestly thinking of that through whole time...I would've done that wayyyy before anyone spilled (when I get the bottle so they cant spill on me)
This looks like something off of tiktok
Damn
They copied it from JoJo
Stop wasting water
This guy had no mercy
I.       Neef.        Wata

No brooo😂
Ok that was funny🤣🤣
If you use cold water there’s gonna be condensation on the outside of the glass. So instead use room temp water and place the glass on a paper towel.
I just wanna sip it so bad😂

He cheated he put a piece of chocolate under the cup and when he needed to moved out the way to make the chocolate melt
🤣🤣🤣🤣👊❤️
Woww😭😭😭

And after he so graciously poured the water on her I would have pushed him into a pool if they had one

Break up
It look like a glass cup idk I might be wrong 😅😂
He's a liar, it wasn't there. They both spilled it, and at the end, she tried to play it off as if it weren't obvious.  "Whoever SPILLS it first" "No! It didn't touch the table *giggle giggle*"  Basically, they're both cheaters.
You're the one who spilled it so she didn't spill it
Joseph did it first 😌
JoJo moment
I literally called it😂
By looks it seems they’re really in a bad relationship, pretending for TikTok otherwise
she looks like marsha may
😂😂😂
You betrayed me and I know you’ll never feel sorry for they way I hurt- LMAO
Now show this to a African kid... very funny...

Is this a jojo reference?

He was right though if u keep adding like a drop of water and a little comes out and u say it dosent spill then the cup will never spill
Thank you. Finally for the first time I see the girl get water dumped on their head and not the boy
she’s so pretty
I love how he said that it "Didn't count" because it didn't touch the table when he spilled but when she spilled and it did the same thing He said that She spilled
PLSSSSSS- THE END-
Only some will use the chocolate trick...
Why he did that? Its not funny
Why are they doing it with cold water outside
I did not see that coming
🤔 how does that work
The fact that she thought she could cheat
Watermelon sugar High

Such a sore loser, I’ve never liked sean

He was the first to spill. She called it and he denied it. This dude is always disrespectful to her. Its so subtle but u can see it. Its not cute its annoying.
She wasn’t in science class cuz she had the whole fball team w her in the locker room
Wtf lol then some goes boo lol I am dead

You need to use room temperature water. The cold water causes condensation on the glass and the water will spill over less obviously than it would  otherwise

Am I the only one who often feels like his actions on videos towards her are just bit off sometimes? And it makes me a little uncomfy
Why cold water? literally ruined the challenge

The girl did not spill it it was the boy you lieer
Is this a change
Shoulda put chocolate under it and waited for the sun to melt it       Haha jojo
The condensation on the outside of the glass was allowing the water to trickle down in tiny amounts when the water tension broke, it would’ve spilled more obviously if the glass was dry on the outside.
Him: pours water on her Her: IM BREAKING UP WITH YOU!!!
🤣🤣😂😂😂😂
He spilled it first
https://youtu.be/gkrqeI1ZLr8

"It's not ever gonna spill"
Not funny you do not pour water on your girl
Revelation 3:15 I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot: I would thou wert cold or hot. Revelation 3:16 So then because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spue thee out my mouth. KJV BIBLE.

Love how they don’t realize it only spills as much as they pour… it’ll never completely overflow
“It spilled” “No it didn’t” “That doesn’t count” “Looks like it’s spilling to me”

WHY IS THIS TRENDING?!?!?!
Obooooo
0:02
I hate him
Fun fact: it’s actually not going to spill, it will slowly lose water by slowly dripping down the sides, the cycle will just repeat.
It feels like the remaining 1% of the battery that seems to last forever.
John 3:16-17 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.17. For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. Romans 6:23 For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Romans 10:9-10 9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.10 For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. Amen.
The nerve lmao is beyond the next level of betrayal 😒😂😂😂💥
That water look good ngl
Y’all it’s not going to spill it’s going to overflow
Wait what he spilled it multiple times too.. 🤷‍♀️
It’s been spilling little by little down the sides of the glass guys.

One doesn’t experience self-transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates🔻

There’s a puddle of water under the glass and they kept playing (._.)
I'm sensing a break up
Netflix: are you all watching? Someone's daughter: the end of this video.
The boy definitely spilled first
Its really running down the sides a lot and y'all don't notice 😂
I don’t understand what they expect to happen? If you keep drizzling water in then water will only ever drizzle out. It’s not gonna be some kinda tsunami lmao.
Everyone i know: never  This guy: not ever
I would hold a grudge for YEAAAARSSS!!!
"Get soak in ice cold water"  Me : pours it right away 😌
I saw that the man was failed but they said that he didnt so ı dont know but ı saw it

They should put a glass into a pitcher and then fill it up with water, when it gets too full it will sink. In the Netherlands we call it duikboten (submarining)!
There relationship is over...

It feels like the remaining 1% of the battery that seems to last forever.
This challenge reminds me of science class when we would see how many drops of water we could fit on a penny without the little dome or whatever it’s called breaking and spilling
Who being the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high;
