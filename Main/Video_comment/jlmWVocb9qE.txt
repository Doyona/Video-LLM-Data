you guys are bad journalists, you ask him about England all the time, he doesn't care.
Kasper was right
Get me a translator for harry Kane
Put this on sky sports Retro 😉 it Will always be relevant
It wasn't a put-down. It was fact.
Are people so dumb that they don't realise that "home" means where the game was invented? 🤦‍♂🤦‍♂
Oh I’ve seen it all now🤷🏻‍♂️ That world famous football pundit and ex professional?? Mr Wright,Y Well done mark on all your success 👏👏👏well deserved mate.
Snap arr
The arrogance of the English is breath taking.
There is no response
Kasper not looking happy - in disbelief more like it…
England will fall apart when thay face an organised team like France, Belgium or Germany. They talk alot on off the field but cant come up with much answers on it
Obviously
As a dane this. Is. Gold. 😆 Because we actually have won the euros and England hasn’t so this is just legendary 😆😆😆
Stupidly structured question by the reporter.  Definitely a red top tabloid which love creating false narratives
kasper is right here, the england interviewer was self centred about england
Kasper is right. It’s never actually been home😂.  First international football game was played in Partick, Scotland and finished 0-0…so unless Scotland win it, and we know we won’t it’s never “coming home”😂😂.
harry kane`s real respond was scoring that penalty to sent kasper home. from a denmark fan
If u didn't know you wouldn't know which was English 🤣
Can’t believe Kasper speaks better English than Harry
I look to the side of my screen it says “ Kane sends England through to Euro 2020 Final “ 😂
Great Kane, great Schmeichel... and at the end it went home, it went really home... it went Rome 😉
I really don’t get why England fans should be upset by that comment… “it’s coming home” has nothing to do with “has it ever been home” England is the home of football as it has the best standard, the sport was created by the English and is by far the most popular sport in the whole world… I’m a German fan and it sucked when they beat us but I keep seeing this comment by Kasper and it really doesn’t make sense
Only one comment: IT'S COMING ROME!!!!!!!!!!!!😅😅😅😅😅😅
harry kane:yes hihahahi hohuho🤣🗣
Won’t come Rome in 2022 England will do better by far🤡🤡
NOOO SO CLOSE
and  next .... coming Rome ! thanks Kasper ! 😁
Arrogant fuckin scumbags got put in their place in the end!
KANE FINISHED. IN THE EUROS. GREEDY PLAYER. WASTE OF MONEY. ONE TRICK PONY. EVEN ARTHUR DALEY.WOULDNT. EMPLOY HIM. THE AMOUNT OF WAGES. HE GETS. SCANDAL.
The only think I see here is another epic win of a great man who answers gorgeously to the classic boring provocative stupid question!  And what I keep seeing  all around is SORE ENGLISH LOSERS!  England lost so many times with Italy and on so many level  (First the human one) the day of the finals I lost the count!! English fans and players you don’t know how to win and you don’t know how to loose ! That’s the reality!  Ciao ciao IT CAME WHERE IT BELONGS TO WICH IS ROME 🤣⚽️🏆🇮🇹
CORRECTION: You're two games away from getting spanked by the Italians.
bruh stop making fun of harry kane's talking problem that's so wrong 😭😭😭
10 54 31 da giocare al lotto ruota di roma e nazionale
Esilarante!!!!
ITALIANS DO THE BEST, !
I wish I could see Kane's interview with the same questions on the 12th  July 🤣🤣è venuta a Roma!!!!! 💪🇮🇹💪
It went to Rome!!!
English supporters believe the rest of the world give a toss about them.
Spolier: it still did not come home … because it came Rome! 🇮🇹🏆
This guy can barely speak, what a clown. Glad England lost.
forza italia
Its a stupid question and its disrespectful, he should of asked about denmark or Erickson. Sometimes its embarassing to be english with the way the journalists and some of the fans act
He was overconfident kid couldn't stop England from going to the finals ... regretted for what he said and kane scored
Anyway you lost...
Spoiler alert! It went to Rome!
Kane SHUT UP!
Harry having to use both his brain cells to respond.
It is obvious that the journalist is disrespectful: he is English! Kasper Schmeichel simply told the truth at the press conference. It's ridiculous just to say "It's coming home" for something that has never been home. But I repeat, they are English, and as such they cannot accept the truth.
LOL well done Italy - its never coming home retards
So, kasper was right...
Italy won for Denmark too. Justice is served.
Kasper the friendly gholie.
Go Woke go broke wankers
There's no point... Kasper ended England and you can see it in harry's eyes
gli inglesi hanno inventato il calcio ma a parte un mondiale rubato alla germania non hanno mai vinto nulla , sono un po come i francesi che hanno inventato il bidet ma non ne hanno mai capito il reale utilizzo.
wow
I love when the ad is half the video length
Where's Bonucci Respond? ahahah
It's Coming Romeeeee !!!!
Kane did nothing in the final! LOL
All I know is that sterling got England to the final by diving.  That’s how they beat Denmark
Mister 175 mln Euro! Mah
I don't think people really understand the song or are just ignorant . Hope Casper goes home soon not to return.Take your old man with you.
Harry Kane did nothing for England against Italy in the finals.  England was unable to keep up with Italy, and the ref didn't give it any gifts as was the case against Denmark.
Kasper didn't 'put down' England. He simply stated the truth.
The entire media bring umbrellas  whenever this guy talks.
Well guess what at least Denmark didn’t stop us
Ma come fanno a parlare di calcio se non hanno mai vinto nulla con la loro nazionale, pazzesco! Ci fosse stato il var nel lontanissimo 1966, altro che mondiale vinto!!
66 you cannot get through a tournament without mentioning something you never seen.. Majority of  enguland fans are trophy virgins
The Euros isn't even half a World cup anyway.
Italy soccer  best in the world
Hahahaha forza italia.😛😉👋👋👋
Kasper was right the journalist has no respect for Danemark his question was insulting
1966 ??? World Cup ??? With the  goal stolen to Germany ??? Now it is in Rome where Britania was founded and created. Italy deserved totally the Victory. They dominated the field for 3/4 of the match. No question.
I don't undertand if it's coming home or Rome ,it's a doubt persecuting me from che beginning of Euro 2020 .Can anyone help me  ? 🤔
sukate ma di brutto
classic boring Basket answer by Kane!!! Witty Dane boring englishman nuff said!!!!
Kasp: Have you ever won it? Englan: We won a different competition.  Mense sakes.
Hold din kæft “Harry Kane” gå hjem til din klamme land og dine beskidte fans beskidt og dig dit klamme lorte “reporter” du skal slet ik tale . Du har ingen respekt og du skal ikke prøve at være sød fordi hele Danmark hader dig og gelé Danmark hader også dig “Harry kane” og dit beskidte hold + land
"All roads lead to Rome" old chap.
Nation of losers
harry has a cringe voice
He sounded like he was English when he said 'was that not the World Cup?'.
Who has the "journalist " who asked that stupid question yo Schmeichel??? So rude!
That English confidence it's just toxic...
Why does Schmiecel sound more english that Kane 😂
It’s coming home, straight to Rome.
When Harry Kane in your team I Guarantee you never win any trophy. Like Tottenham. 🤣
Arrogant man. England 🤢
Now that's why england got kicked from the EU ... they keep acting so from so many years...
for your info , the euro cup is in rome now , thank you
KASPER. WAS RIGHT.  66. YEARS WHEN .ENGLAND LIFTED THE CUP.   NOW KANE HAS HAD HIS TIME.
Referee was BRIBED to award that circus penalty for England
England players are like robots. Proper media trained. Not even allowed to go off character and make a joke like kasper did.
well done denmark you did well a hard team to beat
A casa merde
First of all, Kasper's english is much better than Kane's. Secondly it went over the line by an owngoal and a rebound on a missed penalty which actually should not have been a penalty at all.
Opposition should start singing "You say it best, when you SING nothing at all"
The reporter merely mentioned the cup coming home......the home of football........(England/Scotland is the home of football). I can see Casper being booed at every away ground in the country now.
Sucate frocetti
Is coming Rome and Kane don’t tuck one ball hahahahah
Harry is humble unlike his country people
I was waiting for the 'response' being witty or sarcastic after seeing the title - but there's nothing ?. It must be an English 'thing' as the presenter seemed to be smugly happy with whatever it was that Kane said - baffling !
Kasper spoken english is better than the english captains
Rumor has it kane is still on the ground. What was he playing at diving non stop
Shocking: Harry Kane has a brain unlike many Ingerland supporters who were angry at the answer for no reason
Ageing like fine wine.
Can i tell Harry his Future 🤌🏻🇮🇹
Im fairly fluid in english, but can you please put some subtitles on the second guy???
Dear Danish friends, we took your revenge! I hope you enjoyed! From Italy with love
Ah well England didn't win the euros but at least we still have the Premier leauge the best leauge in the world at the moment constantly winning the champions leauge and europa all English finals recently 👍👏
"Kasper not looking happy" Ehhh?? :D What a smile Kasper ;)
The ‘coming home’ bit refers to England being the birthplace of the modern game that FIFA and EUFA play under; borne out of our association football  - nobody is saying anything about England being the rightful home of the trophy - but having said that; the euro trophy was made here and engraved here.😎🤩🤣 if it was left to that Viking lot we’d be wearing sheepskin shorts and throwing axes at a wooden ball🦶🤪
Loved seeing how upset daddy Schmeichel was on tv after Denmark went out.
Love that! Never been home and will never been home! Viva Italia😃😁😍
Kasper ask the most logical question ever. The Italians are the people that put down England last night 😂
It's going to ROME 🤣🤣🤣🤣
How nice is it to watch Kane's answer now after they've lost xD
It has officially come to rome 🇮🇹
But it didnt come home😃😃😃😃
That kaspar nothing like his dad I find him too arrogant
kasper at the start sounds like he’s proper english
Would have been more fitting if  Kane said "our 'laser' focus is on tomorrow night"
This is even sweeter now 🍬
Home is Rome
England are always ready to create controversy, they're so negative
Can you stop mentioning 1966! It's so cringe and so history. This is 2021! By alluding to this historic victory you're only saying how crap England are!
Kane thinks he is a politician taking a knee , wearing a gay armband stick to the game and leave politics out of sports ! I can’t stand Kane anymore !
Lane can get fucked with all your team and fans dickheads can't take a loss twats spiting their dummies
Great performance and very close in winning the tournament well done to the England team, been waiting for years to see them win major tournament, a brilliant effort and we now have everything in place to have a very good chance to go on and win the next World Cup  🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿👊🏽💯🎉🏆🙏🏽🙏🏽
And now it's coming to Rome 🇮🇹🇮🇹🇮🇹
Two games away lmao, think again. Bottler back at it, IT'S COMING ROME
"not looking very happy about that question" goes back and double checks, Kasper is sitting with a fat smile on his face.
Harry came home alone - hey we colonised and stole football from other cultures fair  and square.
is going Rome
You couldn’t do it on your own football is coming Rome 🇮🇹🇮🇹🇮🇹❤️🏆🏆🏆❤️👏👏👏🇩🇰
Kasper did not put down england  He put it in its place 😂
Well italy won now
You lot didn't invent football
NGL I didnt understand a word Harry Kane said can someone please add subtitles
Arrogance  Still didn't come home
Never
Does that stupid goalkeeper not remember that England beat Germany two all in the 1966 World Cup final??
Well, Kasper was right after all.
It's still not coming home
Has it ever been home hurts alot more now than just a joke
Sterling diving to win penalty lol. The cup didn't come home but Karma did. Congrats losers hahaha
It’s coming Rome
Coming home means its coming home as ENGLAND CREATED FOOTBALL THEREFORE IT IS THE HOME OF IT
Title is 'Footballs coming Home' not the Euro cup or world cup or for that matter the Nations cup. Anyway, he is back home now🤣🤣
Coming home in the context of the song Three Lions means football coming to England in a major tournament not the throphy.
Kasper, coming home means something else you muppet
I always thought it coming home was just a win of anything football related as in Football is English.
England. disappointing
The true.. :  England did not win over Denmark .. They only won by cheating. They used laser light against Schmeichel so he could not focus and grab and hold the ball so Svindler-England could score .. !!! It demonstrates clearly, as well as the fabricated penalty kick, where a hand touched an English player, that Englishmen are immoral, can not play football, are weak, and try to win only by cheating and fraud ..! The European Championships should bend England, as part of the European Championships, as they are not a football nation, but full of deception, lies and low morals, which represent not just the whole country, but every single Englishman .. !!!!!!!
To be honest Peter was Wright, and when they say its coming home, it means England invented football we created it that's what it means, so that reported is a idiot
Haha love Kaspers response 😂
Lol omg even Kane didn't say that it's not about a trophy
Get off your knees.
Forgot the 2nd part of Schmeichel’s reply, along the lines of “I must admit, I haven’t given much thought to what it would mean to England, as much as what it would mean to my own country, Denmark”
i have to learn harry kane english
Come on Italy👍🍻
Sky Sports turning into talksport Mark Wright ffs
Footballs coming home not necessarily meaning a certain trophy
"It's coming home" ...on a Stirling platter, oh sorry SILVER platter, like a Dolphin coming to shore.
Raheem the cheater
Schmeichel: “has it ever been home?!” Savage 😭😭😂
How is Mark Wright still got a job on tv. Zero talent
Kasper was my man of the match in the game. Unlucky to be on the losing side. As cool with the words as with the saves.
Wow Harry Kane is practicing English well
All that money and his underbite remains 😂😂😂
Well said Harry. good man.
ugh i hate kane
How did he put England down you f clowns. England has never ever been to a European final let along win it this year is the first
The song is "Football's coming home" not "The Euro's are coming home", if he wants to be pedantic about it (not a classy look). Now that said,  WHO did Peter Schmeichel play for and win a host of trophies with? WHERE did Kasper spend most of his childhood? IN WHICH COUNTRY has Kasper played his whole professional career? I get it English journos are numpties, but it's no need to insult your host country that has provided an élite lifestyle to you and your family for two generations.
Mouthy Schmeichel  ! Bet he´s not so mouthy now the Danes lost.
Glad Kane scored then
I hate Harry Lane
Thank f** I am not paying for Sky TV.
Who is laughing now hahahahahahaha
Did Mark put money on Harry putting one past Casper...perhaps he should have done...man of vision!
Scandinavian smugness comes back to bite 'em.
How can Harry Kane be such a good footballer, but dumb as a spade?
England won the penalty because the match was played in England. Refree was biased and favoured England ... It was a cheat ...  This is how England wants to win a silverware... Shameful English...
No Casper you missed the point we brought football to the world we invented it you plonker
ENGLAND PAID REFREE TO
Refare should be investigated
Harry Kane put nobody down here especially Casper who only spoke the truth about England never having won this tournament .
Who is the female presenter at the end?
That's what I call a classic reply
Dont worry Kane, ITS SURELY COMING HOME🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🦁🦁🦁🔥🤞⚽️
Humble man
Interviewers ask such stupid questions time and time again. It is annoying. They are not clever in how they do their work. If it’s not that, it tends to be repetitive boring questions:-  Would you have taken that half time score at the beginning of the match? How do you feel now, after loosing 8-0? Etc etc.
Kasper English > Harry English
This euro is for england- play all games tá nome WTF they they have the VAR and the REF help them AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Bit a banter, calm down you queens
Kane is not doing that good this year
hopefully in the tokyo olympics final.. 🇩🇰 Denmark VS Italy 🇮🇹
England winning a game with diving classic :)
Let's be honest Kasper was right. Hopefully we can put that right on final Day.
kane never disappoints with the most robotic response ever
stupid question to ask Kasper tbf.
How about showing the face of these clown journalist that ask these juvenile questions
Ah well, they had to cheat to get past Kasper Schmeichel so he had the last laugh...
oh look it's the Crawley legend himself, Mark Wright!
Well, even though I'd love England to win the Euros, technically, Kasper was quite right.
Whos the female presenter ?
If Harry Kane wasn’t a footballer he would’ve been a politician!
Lol people really getting their feelings hurt because of a journalists question? HAHAHA!!!  I thought global warming was a thing... seems more like global freezing with all you snowflakes around
This is why the world laughs at England and hates them, this is just embarrassing
What was the reporter expecting as an answer what a silly question
I always thought "It's coming home" made sense because we invented the sport. Not because of winning a trophy.
Harry wasn't interested in egos, and it turned out to be obvious to anyone that England were the better team........
Danish goalkeeper, has better grasp of English language and humour than England's captain 😔😔
I really like Harry Kane! But why is his English so weird? Does he have problems with speaking? Something with his voice?
Unfortunately England fans tried to blind the keeper ...
Well it's not going to Denmark is it Casper.🤫
Schmeichl sounds more English than Kane 😂
Fair play to Kasper
He only told the truth
....Harry Kane interviews great cure for insomnia...
Kasper will be one of the most sought after players in the world now.  He has 10 good years in him too.  Tremendous keeper with a fantastic pedigree.  Could become  the world's most expensive keeper this summer.
Kasper , another in a long line of people disrespectful to a country that has given him so much.
It's to do with the origin of modern football, not whether England has won the euros...
Congratulations England on the classy laser light show, artful diving, and accommodating match officials. I heard the timely penalty called "lucky" and I feel certain that England will enjoy similar luck (as required for purposes) at your next home match. No doubt, ecstatic English fans will be able to savor your impending victory for decades to come and you can finally lay by all that desperate crowing about 1966.
I love that Dane!! He's right! Sterling brought home the gold in diving at least... Italy will win this.. better side.. better tactics and hugely underrated.. Because all ya think about is your EPL
congratulations to England for winning the trophy🦉🦉🦉🦉🦉🦉🦉🦉🦉🦉🦉🦉🦉🦉🦉🦉🦉🦉🦉🦉🦉🦉🦉🦉🦉🦉🦉🦉🦉🦉🦉🦉🦉🦉🦉🦉🦉🦉🦉🦉🦉
only luke shaw playing outstanding
This aged well
Its Diving Home!
'It's coming home' refers to football originating in England. I don't know how that's not obvious, although according to slime ball Sepp Blater football is bloody Chinese.
Harry Kane is a goat 🐐
Kasper looked touchy there. Kane calm and relaxed. Who ended up on top?? "ITS COMING HOME ITS COMING HOME!" 🥳
As an englishman it is so annoying how everyone lives in the past and keeps bringing up the ONE time we won the world cup where most of us weren’t even born yet.
I'm here from the future. Kasper saves a penalty from Kane but he puts in the rebound !!
This aged like milk
It’s only bad if England do it. By the standards of the moaners.
England are Diving it home!
How on earth was Kasper being disrespectful? He was asked an inane, asinine and incorrect question and simply answered...Accurately.
1 nil, 2 Casper 👏👏🤣🤣
Does Kane have loose teeth or just a speech impediment   ??
Kane ...like always.....PENALTY.......CLOWN....
Whos here after we won
Schmeichel..We invented the game ! Plus..we wiped the smile off your Fizzog ! He who laughs first, laughs last ! 😁😁😁
Thanks for the sub titles
Ha ha ha Schmeichel ha ha
as an English fan, that was a fuckin dumbass question to Schmeichel. And he spoke facts so take it up in the chin and move forward and we did. Glad we won the game but fair play to Denmark, hell of a campaign!
reporter was asking the question as if england have an awesome history of winning or even making it to the finals, kasper answered perfectly
Yeah now go to McDonal'd to get a bi' ma'c and some chip'
Ouch this hasn’t aged well
Sterling took a dive and Kane got lucky with the peno its that simple but you need luck sometimes.
“What would it mean to you guys to stop it from coming home, tomorrow night?.” If this was the question, wt kind of a response is that.
We best win
Someone should ask Kasper how his vision is?
Denmark were fouling England players all game longas they could not live with England's front runners.  The referee let them get away with it all game long they should had player's sent off for cynical fouls. 21 fouls to England 10. Denmark deserved to lose.
Sky sports are trash
Harry Kane,  had the last laugh. Football coming home..😂😂
Can we have fewer words on autocue for Mr Mark Wright? Keep it below five, poor lad!
The danes are a bunch of small, cocky, wacky players. they only won over lower ranked teams.. as soon as they meet decent resistence they come to short.
What is this title for fucks sake? Schmeichel didnt put England down. The arrogant English media put Denmark down.
Nobody: Harry kane:hrompetrehrion
The arragonce of the England fans and media is a joke ! Kasper was right and they didn’t like it
It not coming home...🤣🤣🤣🤣
Cheats
I just found out how harry Kane is so successful
IM IRISH BUT ENGLAND WILL WIN THE EUROS I BELIEVE: 👊👊👊
Kasper speaks better English then Kane
I really hope kane lifts that trophy so it can give spurs fans some sort of connection to a trophy. They deserve it.
has kasper ever actualy lived in denmark?
the classic foreign journalist who is only there to ask questions about his own country xD
' Its Coming home' naah no way,  'It's going to ROME'
English fan getting hurt over this looool
Coming to Rome … 🇮🇹
Kanes response: Wait to see the referee and Sterling🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Seems like England has quite literally taken it home this season...
What did you want kasper to say? “Yeah, basically I’m just gonna stand outside the net and let it come home for you”  Wtf 😂
its diving home!
Laser on the eyes? oh.. that's just kids having fun.. the far better team won.. England, BEST in the world!
No doubt England deserved to win. Saying that, the English pundits when the penalty was given, saying we don't care if there was contact etc. Yet these same pundits have spent their lives calling foreign players cheats, but when their own do it. Not a problem, it's OK.
Here's one thing Kasper can agree on, he's going home 😀
No England fan can moan if Italy win by a last minute dive
Believe Jesus died for your sins was buried and rose 3 days later and you'll have eternal life and you can never lose it
Didn’t age well I guess from kasper , all jokes beside he was a wall in net
If one of our players said something similar about the Danish we'd be called out and accused of typical English arrogance.
DIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIVVVVVVVEEEEEEE
Kaspers going home😂
A cowardly game from England, a shameful penalty. Rahim can only beg for a penalty, ugh
England won the match, but at least Denmark have the consolation prize of winning the pre-match banter contest 😂
Little did Denmark know, Kane would send England into the final! So much for the keepers snide remark, though somewhat true.
wonder how kasper feels now after last night thumbing his own bus home😁
Here after last nights game 😀🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
HAHAHAHA !!!!!!!
Who the f-ck are these 2
He really hurt the fragile England fans feelings with that comment. They booed him the entire game and couldn't respect that he played out of his mind. He kept Denmark in the game with some incredible saves.
Harry kane... "ভাগ্যবান ব্রিটিশ কুtta"
What is Mark Wright doing on Sky?
Good answer by the goal keeper of Denmark..
Reporter: harry is it comimg home  Harry: erm not sure but kasper is
Shame on Sky for instigating.
Football coming home refers to the simple fact that Football was invented in Britain and specifically Scotland.  It has nothing to do with the EM or WM.  And I say this as a Scot, England have consistently played well over the past 150 years and should have been EM Champions in 1996 and WM Champions in 1990.  As areal sports fan I have no time for al these part time England and UK haters especially those from my own country. Politics should also have no place in this sport,
Typical English reporter! Aswell as typical England. Last night result tarred by the fact  It was never a penalty and Sterling should have been booked for simulation and also there were 2 balls on the playing field and going by rules the game should have been stopped immediately. But then again it’s England and there always giving special treatment by UEFA AND FIFA. All you need to do is look at the FFP punishments they have received
Now England beat them and kick out of semis huaaa
One of the only company's not putting adverts in the videos. Its by the people for the people. Respect for not trying to capitalise off the emotion. Leaving the country space to breath without adverts rammed down our throat. Respect for that! Your prices are pretty steep still though 😁
This is so funny now 😂
Mate Denmark 🇩🇰 has won euros before but England you still haven't so shuuuuush until Sunday.  Lol
1 word football is coming home put that in your pipe and smoke it Kasper Schmeichel you Danish waste man we'll deserved victory for England get in and on to the final Sunday FOOTBALL IS COMING HOME ⚽⚽⚽⚽⚽⚽⚽
England won the match by help of referee ....
Let's be honest here it's diving home.
"Football" isn't "the Euro's" It is football. "Football's coming home" not "The Euro's are coming home"
What a snob Kasper is, well its on the way home
Hahaha Baby Smhmeical not HP
Its coming rome🤣
Go on Barry
The biggest driving cheat in football today, even surpasses Ronaldo.
Well now he can watch from home now they been put in there place
Kasper Schmeichel..he's out of line but he's right.
Well, what happened yesterday? *England flipping won* :) so he can shush.
Who remember cheilini saying England are arogant???😁😁😁😁 Sunday is a game
And this is why we haven’t won nothing for 50 plus years, because of how arrogant we come across. How can you say something’s coming home that you have never won??? Media trying to bait Kasper but never thought he would blatantly give you that response lol.
England created football so it is coming home
Why was Kaspers comments deemed whitty? He literally just stated a moot point. What does it matter if we've never won? Coming home refers to football returning to the country it was conceived. Seems like a linguistical misinterpretation.
Kasper is bang on! It's never been home, then the crowd start booing during the match 😂 how said is that.
Your not smiling anymore
For me footballs coming home has two meanings, yes it means winning the tournament but also in the context of the song which was released in 96 when England were hosting and England is undoubtedly the home of football.
According to schmeichel a word cup is less prestigious than a Euro cup 😆
Yet to be determined is football is coming hone, but Kasper is for sure going home….Kane made sure of that.
Yeah Kasper sent home by Harry! Goodbye 👋
Kaspers comments aged well…
No Kasper was right, why is the English media trying to make people bend to their will. England never won a Euro, was he supposes to focus on opposition rather than themselves ?
Raheem Sterling dove, a laser was pointed in Schmeichel's eyes, another ball before Sterling's dive.  it does not deserve to come home
Come on Italy 🇮🇹
It’s coming Rome and you know it
At least his Dad was gracious in defeat, it was never a pen but we should've scored all night.
🤣🤣🤣
Harry Kane: it's about us, what we can do. Really they did everything, they dived all over as if it was an Olympic diving competition
bloody crook
This aged well😂
Kane responded by scoring the goal that sent peter smiechels son (all he'll ever be) home. I'd rather talk on the pitch than off it. Enjoy the plane big man
Pure class, Harry.
Bad sportsman Schmeichel !!!!!
Who’s laughing now, Kasper? 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
Kasper 🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫
Looks like it is coming home! And Kasper is going home! 😂😂😂😂
Football was invented in Scotland so if England win it hasn't came home
It’s fuxking coming home!!!
Well that's unfortunate.
Well, Kaspar, what's it like to be a loser?
It wouldn't be impressive if England won it they've had the easiest route to the final and have had only 1 away game in the whole tournament. Its natural that teams do better at home than away somewhere else. This euros was unfair on every other country as when it was supposed to be all across Europe, England managed to only have 1 away game. If it weren't for this the euros would have been much more entertaining. Tonight they barely beat a team who are as a nation 9x smaller. And better that its absolutely hilarious that the one team they couldn't beat was their big brother Scotland, England will never have good fans they're bad lovers and horrible winners. I said Scotland were there big brothers as their league isn't as money driven, they have more passion, they come in huge attendances despite the size of their nation, they are humble in defeat and victory, and most importantly they are loud in a football stadium. Is there such thing as ultras in the English premiere league?. I'm not saying England are a bad team im saying that the euros has been handed to them, their fans aren't much better than the Americans and that they are bad winners  and are incredibly arrogant. 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🇮🇹🤝🇪🇺
Well that aged like a fine wine
‘Football’s coming home.’ Not the specific trophy for the tournament in which you are participating is coming home.
You would say that if you’re not an England fan😂
Are you going to win with Italy? Hahaha Haha
ITS COMING ROME !
Great players
Got the last laugh now
Bad reporter work there really.   Fair play to kasper for answering so bluntly like he deserved.
Lol
Hardly a retro style for the ages.
It's coming home 🏡🏡
This aged well
Media asked wrong person to respond. Harry Kane doesn’t know anything about winning titles
The song is "football's coming home" not the euro trophy is coming home, I can't blame a footballer for not being smart enough to understand that though.  I don't know if football is coming home but I know one thing for sure... 🎵schmeichal's going home, he's going home, he's gooooing🎵
How can you be financially free, some please help??
And the you can go home with your bacon
Schemiels going home😂😂😂😂🥱🥱🥱🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I think we will win 2-1 in added time
Football coming home not the cup.
Who’s watching this after England beat Denmark 2-1 lol
Didn't age well for Kasper did it ?
This aged well 😂 good job you saved that pen ….
Kasper should have ignored his dad cos ITS.COMING HOME!!!!!
Who’s here after we smacked them
Aged well
2-1 England Win.. Denmark's Going Home.
Lucky England won!!

How did Kasper get on with that then?!!💥
Very disrespectful from Schmeichel with those comments about the country that gave him the game  which gives him the lifestyle most of us can only dream of.Anyway he's been made to look the fool he obviously is by the boys,looks like football's coming home after all while he's just going home.
These two played a lovley one, two for the second goal ...thanks Kasper!!😉🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿💚
Who’s laughing now Kasper?

I guess Harry had the last laugh.
Haha this aged well. Italy will silence England on Sunday. England haven't played a team who are inform yet. Italy are on a 34+ game unbeatable run.
I think now it's coming home...bad luck for Denmark 🇩🇰 keeper...😑
Kane's best response was scoring a penalty against him lol and knocking him out the competition I think. 😎😎😎

England don't deserve to be in the final. It was because of referee wrong decision which favour the English team. Otherwise it was already out of the tournament. That was not at all the penalty. English team was not able to score even one goal. It was actually Denmark 2-0. England zero goals. What is the use of referee using VAR when it clearly shows that there was no touch??. It was not fair. It is a classic case of favouritism and bad referees.
Anyone here after Denmark and the Ref FC lost to England?
Sterling is a cheat and a diver!! Just saying!! Football fever dies!!
Schmeichel, sh sh shhh it's OK mate
Who’s here after England beat Denmark!! England made it to the final after 55 years 😱😱🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
Whos here after england just won
Kasper  .harry put in your ass goal  huaaaaaa
Most overrated striker of all time.they will never win, definitely loose to italy in finals
Harry Kane - homosexually!🌈
Why is it people in Europe where English is not there first language speak better than the England team. Been puzzling me all tournament. There’s got to be something wrong with our education system.
Stop q by stupid ego driven media
That's what I have always said about England, Harry and Schmeichel are both correct. England should stop singing stupid songs now and first focus on the job. That song is to be kept to be sang when they eventually win in the final not now. England fans always behave like children, and they don't always learn from their mistakes. They sang that song in the World Cup 2018 and yet they didn't bring it home, because they distracted themselves. Yet again, they are making the same mistake. I pray they get the job done this time and not distract themselves.
Stupid question to start with! How did he put them down by speaking facts? Classic media
Schmeichel is a far better goal keeper than Pickford. This could be the key difference between the teams.
it is true though what Kasper said, England haven't won the Euro's to this point so it is a "bit arrogant asking is it coming home"
So called journalists just trying to stir up poop. Kudos for Kane to see through that nonsense
Kasper have done it before  and will do it now
What a terrible question, media around this sport is such garbage lol.
I’ve no idea what harry said but i’m sure he meant well.
A very easy match and within the reach of the English national team. And the dream of the Danish peacock will turn into a nightmare on the Wembley floor.
ask casper where he earns a living.his father would not be proud of him for his comments.
The lions are coming too get you Schmeichel
What England and most of it's nationals did during the 18th and 19th century was documenting things that were already there and claimed them as their discoveries. You can't be a father of something if you aren't any good at it. So, chillout English people
Hahahahahahaaa
the reporter just doomed england
Was hardly a put down of England , ffs 🤦🏻
Even if England Manage to get Pass Denmark Italy is gonna throw them away like Trash. The Only Threating team England has Faced is Germany who wasn't good From tge Start of The Competition. Soo They Should be worry about Facing Denmark
On your knees Harry
It's all bollocks and it's wearing thin. Now get the game on ffs
Yeah obviously
The hurt will continue ENG......
Kasper is a fuckin' legend
Harry Kane what a gentleman! 😎
Typical English media......... talking arrogance and bullshite
Why is he doing a Danish accent ? He's lived in England ALL his life
😂😂 Kane taking no prisoners with that response 😴😴
How to wind up the opposition? Listen to Casper.
Doesn't matter that it hasn't come home yet, what matters is that it will. Football is a legacy that no one can take away.
Kasper has better english than Kane.
Kasper sounds more English than Kane😂
To the one who has ears to hear, let him hear this message   Don’t play games with you’re soul Jesus loves you so much as you can see from what’s going on in the world things have changed and you probably wonder at times if things will Ever go back to normal ?   the answer to that question is no. God is allowing you to see just how evil this world is and you’ve seen so much that should make you think and ask yourself is God speaking to me ? Is God warning me ? yes he is and God will judge this world but God is patient with you and with all Not wanting any to perish but all to be saved   Today and even now is time of salvation make the best decision you can make in this world and give you’re life and you’re heart to Jesus Christ and accept Jesus as you’re Lord and Saviour doing so while understanding this fact that eternity is forever with no end And no such thing as time in eternity    God loves you so much God doesn’t force you to accept him but they are consequences for rejecting the forgiveness that God offers to you through Jesus who died for you as a sacrifice for you’re sins   God wants to forgive you and save you but you need to stop running away from God the bible says all have sinned and are guilty before God but loves us so much that he made a way for us to be saved   the judgement of God is near with all that’s happening in the world the earthquakes the volcanoes the vaccines it’s obvious that something is going on and you need to get right with God because you’re sins separate you from God. God doesn’t want you to Go to hell which Is why Jesus died for you In you’re place paying the price for you’re sins   receive the forgiveness of God in Christ Jesus today   John 3  For God so [greatly] loved and dearly prized the world, that He [even] gave His [One and] only begotten Son, so that whoever believes and trusts in Him [as Savior] shall not perish, but have eternal life.  Whoever believes and has decided to trust in Him [as personal Savior and Lord] is not judged [for this one, there is no judgment, no rejection, no condemnation]; but the one who does not believe [and has decided to reject Him as personal Savior and Lord] is judged already [that one has been convicted and sentenced], because he has not believed and trusted in the name of the [One and] only begotten Son of God [the One who is truly unique, the only One of His kind, the One who alone can save him].   This is the judgment [that is, the cause for indictment, the test by which people are judged, the basis for the sentence]: the Light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the Light, for their deeds were evil. For every wrongdoer hates the Light, and does not come to the Light [but shrinks from it] for fear that his [sinful, worthless] activities will be exposed and condemned  . But whoever practices truth [and does what is right—morally, ethically, spiritually] comes to the Light, so that his works may be plainly shown to be what they are—accomplished in God [divinely prompted, done with God’s help, in dependence on Him].”” ‭‭John‬ ‭3:16, 18-21‬ ‭  For the wages which sin pays is death, but the [bountiful] free gift of God is eternal life through (in union with) Jesus Christ our Lord.” ‭‭Romans 6.23  2 Peter3   9The Lord is not slow to do what he has promised, as some think. Instead, he is patient with you, because he does not want anyone to be destroyed, but wants all to turn away from their sins
Can Harry Kane stop being professional for one second.
Schmeichel was simply stating the obvious. Has anyone else noticed how everything in the UK these days has to be reduced to some trite inaccurate and meaningless slogan.
"Kasper not looking happy when asked that question". Because it was stupid. And now they are trying to stir it up. Typical media slimebags

Schmeichel's got better English than Kane lol
As a Scotland fan with a lot of English family, I wish England well. Good luck, hope you get to the final and win it. I will be cheering for England tonight.
That's how dull banter has become. I was expecting something edgy and quick. That response had asthma and a glass eye.
Should have sent someone out to speak who doesn't have a mouthful of marbles
Apparently Southgate stuck this on a tablet in the dressing room
big Hazza claps back!!
Glad I watched this.
It appears even here nobody is aware that “ it’s coming home “ refers to the obvious fact that football was invented here......... strewth! 🤦🏾‍♂️
I mean he’s not wrong 😂
The media might love harry kane but he'll never be a rooney... will he go missing tonight ??...  2/1 he does
What language is Harry Kane speaking? Can we have some subtitles please?
The English have made fools of themselves by singing it's coming home ..your country has never won it and even your sky sports reporters got it mixed up with a world cup ....don't even show up because Italy has it again
Kasper catching bodies
i like k
Send me some crypto 🙏🏼0x2d210a936009A48DF404035cd8Fa1554bBe8DD79
Arrogant English media at its finest.
Please Harry - stop talking...
I like Kane, he's humble, hard-working, and talented—the exact opposite of his country's garbage media.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Harry kane is sooooo boring like watch paint dry listening to him
Harry so funny
How is it that Schmeichel "put England down" when he only said plain facts? Now, extrapolate this irrelevant sport example to the level you like and you get  Fake News!
Isn't "it's coming home" a reference to England's inventiom of football?  Rather than a specfic cup.
Clearly No one told him we invented it 🤣... That's why it's coming "home"
These guys know how to make players fight!
Idiotic reporter, honestly fire that utter moron
Lol, there is no comeback to that.
Let’s go Kane
brilliant response harry.....top banter!,..obviously...
Didn't understand a freaking word Harry Kane said to be honest.
put down more like stupid question
Like Kane’s reply.
I really don’t understand the joy of making fun of someone’s speech impediment!
Kaspers a legend
The song refers to the creation/ invention of football which was obviously English and winning a World Cup or Euros would give the feeling that the country that spawned the game has finally brought another trophy back. The song is already self deprecating so shut the fu*k up Schmeichel cos 'it's coming home' 🥳
How the hell is saying the truth considered a "put down"? The British Media are the finest twats on the planet
Let it not be said Kane isn't an engaging and mercurial personality, he's even more irresistible in front of goal.
Title should read: Butt hurt Sky Sports commenter offended over facts.
It was never about winning euro 96, it was about hosting it and the joy of that. Very simple.
Footballs coming home refers to the games origin in the UK.
I couldn’t understand but i bet it was very funny
Kasper I hope you have a bloody nightmare mate 👍
Kasper employed in England... zero f***s given
What does Harry mean by hompetition?
Hardly a put down. Just answered a daft question with a bit of personality. Media scraping for drama as usual.
denmark never won a world cup
I don't think Kasper understood the question, bless him he is blonde..reporter asked what it would mean to stop it coming home not if it had ever been home 🤷🏻‍♂️..✌🏼💚
Don't worry Schmeichel. Kane will Destroy you. Also It's Coming Home 🏠🏠.
How is that a put down lol I cant wait to see England lose
I support england but I must say Kasper was spot on in his answer, who made the question tried to pull kasper's leg but he was so smart he belittled him instead. 😁
Kasper, the song title refers to the 96 competition being held in England, the content of the song refers to England's failure to win major trophies. Good job you're a goalie. 👍
He’s right, every time it’s coming home! Which home? As it ever been home! People big mad 🤣 have a glass of 🥛
Sense Denmark  win cup
England will smash the Danish bacon lovers ..... however that comment was hilarious from my man Kasper
«He is right» was basically the response. Good  on Kane for not getting sucked in.
Calfreezy was right. The most boring bloke ever.
Kasper like I was 5 years old when my dad brought it home .... 😀😀🇩🇰
All of this is pointless everyone knows it’s coming home may as well have trophy preparation tomorrow
His “put down” when that was a ridiculously dumb and self centred question 🤣🤣
I hope Harry scores a few past Casper as songs it’s coming home right into his face!! 😂
Kasper getting a bit of stick over this, but here's the thing, he was spot on! Made the reporter look stupid to be honest!
How could they say It's coming home.!??? They can say that it's coming to England.. that's more appropriate.
The nations in this tournament have more to play for than just beating England... the arrogance of the English media sours people's perception of the team in a big way
He didn’t put England down. He put the reporter down. And rightly so, the question sounded like one from a 10 year old.
England should win whole thing now, they have had home advantage almost every game , hardly any travelling, home fans in and the millions they have spent on training facilities , specialists in all aspects of sport.Besides the second half of last game England have been boring and predictable, can anyone tell me a memorable moment or piece of magic by england? I never thought I would enjoy watching Italy before England .
pwned
Its squeaky bum time now! nerves is the only thing that could mess england up LOL
Kane's reply wasn't even a retort. He simply acknowledged the truth in Schmeichel's answer. That's the most one can do in pre-match situations like these. The rest is to be replied on the pitch.
He does realise that 'it's coming home' is because football was created by the English?
its "football is coming home" not the Euros is coming home, ya know cause England invented the sport
Pundits will obviously favour ENG. They need to relax.
English media do us no favours in regards to how we are viewed by other nations. Well said kasper
The chant is footballs coming home.  So what they on about.  We invented football so it's irrelevant if we've won the euros or not.
I want England to win because I like the players and manager, but the media are absolutely the worst.
Coming home to Denmark.
To be fair, the journalist asked how Denmark will stop it coming home, as in, how to stop the cup from coming home to England. If Denmark win it, then it will be coming home with him to Denmark. It would probably be more embarrassing had the journalist asked him, how to stop it coming ‘back’ home. So great response from Harry.
Not looking happy?? He looked pretty relaxed to me
England is like that ugly kid on the playground who doesn't know he's really ugly so he hits on the girls and acts rubbish, but in reality everyone just feels bad for him until he takes it overboard like the British always do.
Love Harry
Put two passed him 2 nite harry. And bring it home
Harry Kane has the personality of a boiled egg
If England didn’t fear Denmark, they would be fair and give half the tickets to Danish fans not just 5000,
Its comming to ROME
Has it ever been home?
His comment wasn't that it hasn't come home, it was that England is not 'home' for anything international football success related
I thought the English were supposed to have a great sense of humour and the Danes were supposed to be humourless.  What's going on here?  I want answers.
Kane has dealt a hammer blow to the Danish with them comments
To be fair I think that's a nice little jibe from Kasper, slightly teasing us English but also making a very fair point!  Adds to all the build-up. Got to love him. But please concede a few tonight.
Still surprises me how Mark managed to get that job
Why does Harry always look like he's been chewing on concrete.
'We're two games away' sounds almost like 'a bridge too far'.
Kasper made a great response to yet another stupid question that seems to forget that England, contrary to the belief of English media heads, is not the center of the universe.
The way Kasper responded had so much swagger
Kasper starts banter and Harry shuts it down.. boring
I think ‘coming home’ refers to the fact that football started in England. I don’t know how anyone thought casper’s comments were witty or inspired, they were based on misunderstanding. Harry’s response was spot on, and very clever. Most comments are low life slurs regarding Harry’s speech!
So Schmeichel states a current fact yet the reporters want to create conflict between him and Kane or England... PATHETIC!
Denmark won the competition in 1992 if I remember correctly.  And Greece won it in 2004!  So it is doable!  Just that Italy may have the same idea(!).
By coming home we don't mean the trophy is coming home 🤦🤦 it just  means that football's coming home to it's creater, make what you want to make of that. Why are these ignorants and haters still  bringing this up ???
WoooooooowW What a Response Harry!   Lool
So?
Well Kasper is spot on we haven't won it yet! Kasper probably be the hero for Denmark and stop England, lol, it's coming home song is annoying af tbf! lmfbo if that did happen and Denmark do beat England and Kasper is the hero.
Harry Kane sounds like Darren Farley
Great character from kane
How on Earth is that a put down? he is just stating the facts
Come on Denmark!!
England is still the home of football.. we have just been missing something lol 🤣
Kane has scored more past Kasper Schmeichel than any other keeper
Kasper speaks better english than Kane
To all the foreigners fascinated by the UK media.  Thanks for the compliment.  (But we still couldn't give a 7ck about yours)
'Football's coming home' just meant the tournament was coming home, to England in 96. It technically has 'come home' again this year.
Typical arrogant English reporter.
We will see if Kasper keeps smiling like that when he has to get the ball out of his net
Really good to see Harry not responding to this rubbish question thing.
Kasper Schmeichel: EPL, FA Cup   Harry Kane: Golden Boot, MBE
Come on England, do it for BRITAIN 🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧
Loved Casper's response :P come on Danes! Do it 4 Eriksen... i hope Casper's wit and confidence doesnt come back to haunt them :P
Pray Kane puts a hatful past Denmark 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
It´s not a put down. Issa fact.
Good to see Harry Kane's English is getting better.
England will bring football home... by having the final at Wembley 😀
when you’re on media company’s payroll, stupidity comes long with it………..
A withering retort from HK. Cutting, witty, charming yet succint. A true raconteur. ffs
I dont blame kasper. You cant bring home what was never at your place. Nemo dat quod non habet ( google it) I still dont see why every international competition's feelings have to revolve around how england feels over it. Footbal was born in scotland, you do know that right?
I dont blame kasper. You cant bring home what was never at your place. Nemo dat quod non habet ( google it) I still dont see why every international competition's feelings have to revolve around how england feels over it. Footbal was born in scotland, you do know that right?
i dont blame Kasper….the journalist is STUPID…!!! Sky’s peep  i wonder…🤷🏻‍♂️💁🏻‍♂️🤭
See never showed this last. Night Casper had lot say reporter , CNT take Danes lightly full steam I think tonight if lose well better team will win on night either way best luck Danes ,
Stupid question which he should of answered with a bit more tacked knowing the background of the country.
kasper is right in terms of what question was asked
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣Well done kasper hope u win tonight come on 🇩🇰🇩🇰🇩🇰🇩🇰🇩🇰🇩🇰😜😜football not coming home Again!!!!!!!!! 😜😜😜😜😜
God the reporter has to get something called a sense of humour
Footballs coming home. The home of football. Admittedly we're not the best at it, but here is where it began. That said it was a stupid thing to ask. Good luck to both team's, hope it's a great game.
This nonsense about England being home to football should stop.  The laws of Association Football were drafted in England, but so what?  England hasn’t been the greatest footballing nation.  It’s not like Canada with ice hockey.
can someone make subtitles from 0:15, can't hear what that mong is dribbling....
Denmark are gonna win this
Kasper is a number 1 football shill!!!
Was hardly a put down, keep your jocks on.
Nice reply for its coming home Op brother
Can someone explain why mark wright is on my screen
Erm erm erm
Shots fired!
That was an arrogant question to ask , that is the main reason why I don't want England to win it, Italy will win it
Lazy and poor journalism, shock
You know... If England weren’t so smug I would probably support them. But this is why other fans don’t like England. Questions like that
All ANGLAND FOR THE CUP THIS TIME COMON ANGLAND GARANTI
Kane always appears a right sour faced git to me. Just saying.
that was proper stupid thing to ask Kasper, sports journalism fuked up in uk
Brazilians spoke ''it's coming home'' in 2014 ! And look, what happened after...
I hate Harry Kane’s professionalism, have some passion and just reply we’re playing nobody’s who is that talking away isn’t that peters son
Kasper football has always been at home for England we invented the game tut tut tut know your history.
Lol...English press...smh
To be fair we say it's Coming home because we invented football... Not because we won it..
The reporter who asked the question to Kasper just turned me from a neutral to a Denmark fan. Well done
On another note Harry why not respond with the fact they didn't actually qualify when they won it they need to thank the countries of yugoslavia!
as a spurs player
Typical English 😂  Casper was right, it’s not home so why say it? Never won it and to throw 66 World Cup, really??? Still going on about last century 😂
Even if we beat Denmark which we should Italy will be a very tough nut to Crack.
Kane cracks me up
he didnt put England down he get a stupid question
England's media is to blame for inflating expectations.
Kasper spoke the truth so the English hate him now.
Come on Denmark 🇩🇰
IDIOT....  Kasper LOOKED VERY HAPPY TO GET THAT QUESTION AS HE HAD THE PERFECT ANSWER  Did the Sky moron think we did not done see or hear that?
It would help if the reporter (and Schmeichel) knew what the song is about. They lyric is wistfully remembering past glory and lamenting past failures. It is not an arrogant boast that we are the dog’s bollocks who deserve the trophy by right!,  but a song of hope that we’ll do better this time....more than any other time. This time...😄
What is Mark Wright doing there? Seriously....
Kasper is pretty much english so i dont see why people made such a big deal about his joke
Very classy response from Kane. Not so classy from Kasper. You won’t find our “arrogant” players belittling other countries.
Just friendly banter. Kasper was joking around. Harry knew it and didn’t take the bait.
Kasper Schmeichel is a premier League winner. What about Harry Kane? 😜
And then they cheated the ball never crossed the line He's right it's never been home.
TBH Kasper is not wrong. Denmark last won it in 1992, and England has not won since 1966. Also, England does have a very good squad, but come on English players are always somewhat overrated. I think this continual appraisal from the media always builds up the hype for England which in turn is disappointing when England losses.  Overall, both teams are good, and I'm actually supporting England, but I wouldn't be unhappy if Denmark won too.
Serious question: Has Kasper ever lived in Denmark? I’ve said before “It’s coming home” should mean football is coming back to where it was born/created buuut if the oppo are going to get so easily needled by it (which all the comments suggest as “arrogant” confirm) then yeah belt it out at them. 😜 Usually  you don’t give away weaknesses that quickly.
Harry Kane licks the windaes oan the bus
Schmeichel's response to that stupid question was meteoric lol
I love how they say Kasper “put down England” how do you think Denmark felt when that reporter asked that dumbass question?
Harry should have said it’s coming home cos we invented the bleeding game
England will win it this year, denmark has no chance, england will beat italy as well
Omg the English reporter asked a player playing against England for the English media about England! Wow English people are so arrogant! Why don’t they discuss Kenya!
Hopefully South gate shows Kaspers comments to the boys
Raheem 🔥🔥 will do it again
Brilliant from Kasper. Seriously the Poms sure know how to jinx their chances.  I hope they do win but try a little humility guys
Wtf was this.. Journalism in the UK is dogsh!te. Sky is a disgrace.
He didn't even defend the English singing it's coming home, he just accepted Schmeichel's slap to English faces 🤣🤣🤣
It's coming home means football coming back to where it started not if you've won it we made football thats why it's coming home
I don't see nothing wrong with Casper comment..
Kane looks like a Geography teacher
I think Kasper did a great disadvantage to his team ahead of the semifinal...
The danes are  acting like they've already won the tournament, big mistake
Gonna be so funny if Harry kane scores tonight! Shut those dirty cocky Denmark players up
Harry Kane makes Michael Owen sound exciting.
C'mon lads!!!! It's Coming HOME👊🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
harry kane discussted that a bloke named after a ghost can speak better than him COME ON DENMARK
Schmeichel's comments are a better listen if you consider that Denmark have actually won the euros. I'm sure the cup was comfortably at home in Copenhagen for a bit.
Maybe what the saying "Footballs coming home" means is its coming to OUR home, not THE home of football!
I found it quite disrespectful especially after his career and upbringing in England. Theres too many people missing the point and meaning behind the chant. if you don't sing it you won't understand.
Reports have it that, Harry Kane will be taking English lessons from Kasper next season
These "journalists" loooool
Pls sacked that reporter who asked that question to kasper.
Football is such a white supremacist sport, invented by the British colonialists and exported around the world. In fact, most major sports that make millions of dollars, are all born from the British. Football, Rugby, cricket, tennis, cycling, industrial revolution, etc, etc
I thought, "footballs coming home'", is not about a competition/cup, etc 'coming home' as such, but more about England being the home of football, *the originator of modern football...*  hence, "football's coming home'"...  but Kasper is correct of course, just the understanding of what "football coming home'" actually means isn't correct.
After all the talk, imagine the meltdow if England loses tonight 😄
it's coming home means football returning to the country of its invention. slight misunderstanding I think
A real brain fart of a question from the reporter
COME ON DENMARK
Time Denmark was going home
Hope Kane rockets one in from 25 yards against kasper
Kane said if we can get it right,history of the spurs in him😑
Love Kasper, and that interviewer got exactly what he deserved from a pretty sharp cookie. There was no disrespect, but just an honest, sharp factual response.  To be honest this coming home gets on my nerves the way it’s wheeled out at every opportunity and usually out of context.
Haha has it ever been home? England never win euro  omg 😱
Draw
Casper: Has it ever been home?  Me(Non brit) : That one there is a violation ,Personally I wouldn’t have it.
Like always, English medias making their usual best efforts to motivate the opposition team, captain, manager... with arrogant and silly questions.
Which one is england player again?
I think we call all agree that reporter fucked it
Kasper is English, who is he kidding.
Harry kane vrs Kasper...but Kasper  wl be hard to beat...then..Denmark wl score more goal..(2)..compare to Englang 1..😀🇱🇷🙋‍♂  bye bye England
Kane hat trick just to rub it in COME ON BOIS
I bet Kane is great to have at a party😕
I mean Kasper grew up in Manchester, went through Man City's Academy, and a fan of The Inbetweeners.  Of course he speaks better English than Kane.
Kasper,you legend
The problem is our media think we have won it .Bunch of clowns
Kanes true response will come tonight when he's sticking the ball in the back of the Danish net👊
Kane is Irish.
"Kasper not happy with the question" more like English journalists being mad at Kasper's witty reply.
Lol
Irrelevant.  If England win they're not beating Italy.  Nothing has been clearer in human history.  Denmark will be England's first test so far. To this point they have struggled if we're honest.
Dumbass question!!!!!
Dullard
Comeeeeee on England
Come on Denmark!!! You've got our suport from nearly everyone in Scotland😂😂
How can something come home if you never had it in the 1st place? Typical British media.
I'm an England fan, but Schmeichel's comment was pretty funny tbh
Southgate pre match team talk just got a lot easier if that isn't enough to motivate the team to demolish Denmark then this generation will never achieve anything
Mark Wright stick to your poncy  tv shows please.
Peter Schmeichel’s son, nowhere near as good as his dad.
England is just too arrogant...
Im with kasper on this.coys
What's meant by that is the game was first played in this country the birth of football. Any form of cup for England is football coming home.. COME ON ENGLAND..
England England England!! All the Best!! YNWA Cape Town. Much Support here.
Well done kasper. Someone had to say it
Even if we win this They will still say we ain't played anyone Do you know why It's because everyone isnt as good as their previous So boo hoo It's coming home
tbf coming home refers to football not the trophy.. as in England started modern football and so if we win it comes full circle..
Kasper - have you ever won it ? Kane - yeah vsbfwc jbkacdbkbadcbflibaklrcbkbsfkxzgbsfbcjkabcdfksbk
Kasper with the perfect northern Accident.especially when he said the ‘World Cup’.
Saying it's coming home as if it left and is coming back. England haven't won the euros ever but Denmark have and Peter Schmeichel was the goalkeeper back then. If his son wins it that would be incredible but I don't see Denmark beating Italy. I see them beating England but not Italy. Even though England are expected to win, I'm not ruling out Denmark. They could do a Croatia in 2018 World Cup
kasper went for the throat
Beware of bucket of cold water, because you think it will come home, is dynamark play a lot, it will be a difficult game.
Is it coming rome/home...... 😂😂😂
Schmeichels is a legend 💪💪 that response was epic
Its coming home has nothing to do with winning a tournament 🙈 Its because the origins of football were made in England.....
Has it ever been home😂😂😂😂💦
'Put down of England'? Bruh that reporter was putting down Denmark, Schmeichel was well within his rights to banter him back. Imagine thinking that a Danish player would be focused on 'stopping' England rather than winning themselves...
I'd hate to hear the banter in the sky sports offices
He talks like such a melt
Wonder where all the Kasper ass lickers are gonna be when Denmark get pumped tonight?🤔
He's right though!
Kasper speaks better english than harry kane
This interview was quite long , and the reporter said it right at the end .  I see no problem here.  Come on England 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿  👍🏼🍺⚽️🥊
Kane absolutely smashed it with that response. Sick burn.
Why would you ask a Danish player if he thinks England will win 🤔
Kane is a great player but he is thick as mince.
Good question,has it ever been home?🤣 and Harry kane answer it so well. Although England have the squad to eliminate Denmark tonight but Italy gonna win the Euro because those Italian boys are something else
The arrogance is not by the playing staff but the English media - Luka Modric
Yes Harry you tell him. Much love to my beloved England from sunny Florida!!!
Kasper you G! 🤣🤣🤣
Oooohhh that Harry Kane sure does ooze personality doesn’t he?
Come on Denmark, you've got the entire world (besides the butt-ugly whinging inbred poms) behind you!!
Kasper needs to remember where he applys his trade 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
It's coming home means back to its birth place. England is where football as we know it began.
Kasper taking the piss🤣
For people who think Harry Kane's reply was witty or humorous. His reply was simply a sincere acceptance of the fact that they hadn't won it yet and an optimistic approach towards their chances this time around.  I know this should be pretty straight forward. But people don't seem to get this !
This is just poor journalism.
The phrase 'It's coming home!' refers to the fact the English invented the sport of football/soccer. It has nothing to do with past trophy wins. It simply means that the sport is coming home to the nation that invented it.
Hey Harry Kane
It is  come home  football England win today against Denmark 100%
If I was Harry I would have just said, Yeah well it's definitely not coming home for Denmark!
Kasper's dad probably laughing like it was 1992.
England is the home of football. That’s the point that Kasper is missing lol
He meant 'it has never come,home', then why should they be afraid of England .
Kasper, very good
Danish fans have a new song. "We're going home,  we're going home, we're going,  Denmark's going home" .🤣🤣🤣
Harry kane is such a bad captain, why didn't he say, footballs never even been on holiday to Denmark, or its where you play football kasper
Kasper "not anywhere near as good as his father" Schmeichel
I agree with Kasper. Our song and national chant is incredibly presumptious and arrogant and we look silly for it every time we get knocked out
The reason people hate England is because of the media. Good luck England. Good luck Denmark.
Schmeichel was 💯 , disrespectful question to ask. Denmark have also made it to the semis
This is why people can’t stand England. The pretentiousness disregard and disrespect to opponents and arrogance is something nobody does to their level. The English media have a lot to answer for.
Its not what he said, its the way he said it. Simply can't teach that.
England will beat Denmark comfortably. Denmark punching well above their weight. Definitely an England Italian final
Stupid question from the reporter.
That question is Stupid
🇩🇰
Foreign players always speak better english than english players. Being stupid in england is a badge of honour. It is something to aspire to.
My dad’s bigger than your dad - Kasper would win
Kasper has said nothing wrong here.. he's right we've never won the Euro's, just stating facts LOL.. BUT STILL... IT'S COMING HOME!!!
Kasper speaks better English than Harry haha
I'd put up what Kasper said all over England's changing room to motivate the players.
0:16 ya argh ya he is right Ya arghh coming home
Kasper: has it ever come home? Kane: yeahh..eemmm...rrmmm.
And this is why people from Scotland, wales and Ireland get pissed off. It’s not the team or the people we don’t like, it’s the arrogant English media. They’ve been saying this nonsense since they beat Croatia in the group stage, it’s pathetic. I personally would like to see England win it, but it’s the twattish English media that make me not want them to win.
england fans i really want to see your faces when you are getting knocked out by denmark and you realise you blew it AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN!
Argh really?😒 that response from Kane was as weak as his start to the tournament. Top player though
Denmark didn' t even officially qualify for Euro 92 and they still won it!
So now Denmark is the villain to put down..tbh the question is a trap
Here we go again..english media smh
the arrogance to call it 'home'
Professional banter
Harry Kane... Wanker!
Oh, let's make fun of the way Harry speaks even though he's already done better at life with a speech impediment than all of his haters have without one. 👍
An insult to Kasper! Terrible reporting
Hilarious Harry 🤣classic !
Vi er røde, vi er hvide Vi står sammen, side om side.. Vi er røde, vi er hvide Vi står sammen, side om side.
Imagine it is Jamie Vardy that answer the interview.
Kasper is just gutted he didn't get an England call up! 🤣🤣🤣
Fun fact: Kane has scored more goals against Kasper than any other goalie.
Trust a dane to be more artuculate then our own player
English media outdated and boring 🤦‍♂️
The phrase "its coming home" is wrong and right.  What comes home could mean something that once belonged there and is now returning. Coming home might also mean that the trophy may have been alien or a stranger to the UK but now it's coming home.  But the English fans create a false impression that sounds like "they own it" when they say its coming home.
Tne funniest part of the video is the transition between 0:15 and 0:16 when the camera cuts from Kasper Schmeichel's smirk after completely destroying the reporter to Harry Kane looking confused and out of it as he starts answering his question.
Ok, the song was written about the World Cup but it equally applies to Euro 2020 as we invented the game and it will be a major international trophy coming home, with most of the previous World Cup winners already dispatched from it 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
Kane just echoed what Casper said about their teams. And i don't see anything wrong in the way how Casper asked. The presenter don't even know what he tries to tell us
kane has scored his most goals against kasper!
No one can disturb your peace unless you give their opinion power to, let no words disturb you or offend smile and laugh
Leicester City  vs  Tottenham   England  vs  Denmark   lol    kone  vs  kasper Schmeichel    lol           in euro won  🏆  England  winning   coming home
denmark will win
Kanes vibrant and energetic personality really shines through
Kasper Schmeichel is trying to put more media pressure on the English players. Harry Kane is trying to diffuse it....
We will pump Denmark like we pumped Ukraine...   Queue the impending, 'this comment aged well' comments.
Wise up fs he's right but England has never won it still go on bout 66 like it was yesterday can't wait de they fck up England are the spurs off international football 🙄🙄
Casper's "put down?" Give me a break! The journalist was putting Denmark down and Casper destroyed him.
If there is ever a quote to rile the troops, then thats it, come on England.
Classic comeback by harry....whaaaaa
The incredible wit and humour of Harry Kane's retort has me in stitches.
True though, you can’t call it a home when it’s only visited once in 100 years. More like, it’s going to a hotel I visited once on a crappy holiday I still bang on about 50 years after the fact
Football is coming home, Denmark is going home.
I thought Kasper was English and vice versa.
I’m all for professionalism but Harry Kane is the most boring footballer in existence.
I predicted that the final would be between *Italy* and *Denmark.* One half of my prediction came true last night. The other half will come true tonight.
kasper's reply was spot on. If you ask stupid questions like this you should get trolled
Why either of them were asked this is absolute garbage journalism
How is that clown on Sky Sports News ? Jesus...
lol...as if Denmark are relevant.
I like Kane's style: simple, serious, professional, no banter, no controversy, never gives the damn journalists a chance to come up with clickbait-headlines. It reflects his personality, which I admire just as much. There are enough comedians, prima donnas and attention whores in football  these days.
What coming home? Has it ever been home? HAHA
😂😂😂 Kasper so cheeky
Think perhaps a few people have misunderstood what 'footballs coming home' means. It's not a trophy that's coming home, it's our game. And it's just a song kasper, about just a game. Pity that so many people confuse hope - after so many years of failure - with arrogance.
Cricket coming home to Lords.. Tennis coming home to Wimbledon.. Football coming home to Wembley.. With this term 'its coming home' English wants to take credit for all sports, but no one else calls England home for any sport.. Only English people say this as they suffer from superiority complex originating from their colonial past.. And I hope 'IT GOES TO ROME' 😋
In what possible way was what Schmeichel said a put down? It was a factual statement in response to a stupid question that only English people care about.
Battle of English fluency : Kasper 1:0 Kane
Arrogant English
I'd rather he was fit, focused and firing than able to crack better banter so this is fine with me. Come on the boys.
England show no promise- I wish England were more professional and focussed England show promise- Harry Kane is SO BORING
Surprised Sky didn’t call this HEATED!
My view - The game of football began in the UK, we were the country who invented it.... that's why football's coming home! Kasper should have been put in his place with that response
'It's coming home' was originally just meant to mean the Euro's was coming to the birthplace of football. Now it's been turned into England will win a trophy.
Hopeless, disrespectful self centered journalism from English journalists as ever.. and when England do fail, watch how quickly they will jump on them.
We are coming home! 🇩🇰🇩🇰
Have to watch a 20 second add, to view a 50 second clip
The great heathen army is coming home !!!
Harry sounds more foreign than Kasper.
More muck stirring from the usual two Bob English reporter, smugly saying anything for a cheap story.
Just to mention that Harry Kane in the premier league scored the biggest number of his goals in the Leister, 11 times))
Enough trash talk! This is not boxing.
Regardless of the outcome, Schmeichel definitely looks like a more cheerful bloke than Kane.
Kanes gonna wipe that smile of his face hahahaha
Say it after you reach Final, Mate... focus on the match first
what did harry say?
🤣🤣🤣🤣, if anything Shmeichel should be the one saying that statement coz they won it before
Which one is the native English speaker?
Does it not refer to the fact the game of football originated in England..?
England sure do know how to annoy the rest of the world
Harry Kane with the tantalising conversation. Our Captain!
I think that it would be disrespectful to the inventors of football to play the missing games. Danes and Italians should hand in a beautiful metal plaque as an hommage and leave the pitch, waving to the fans in the stadium. And then: the glorious celebration of the inventors of football. This is gentlemen-like behaviour and fair play.
Yea obviously
It's gonna be a tough season for him at Lec !!English pundits might burn him  for no reason is all I can predict.  If England lose
English media just cringe and shite tbh
Well said Casper 😂😂😂
I was supporting Denmark to win the euro because of the atmosphere they have since Eriksen incident but kasper just gave the win to England i have watch football for a while now and I can tell you any player who down their opponents before the game always ended up losing
Nah nah nah its home @ present being @ WEMBELY 🙌🏽👏🏽🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿#3-0/1🕺🏽
Ouch....lmao but england will go through
It wasn't a put down. What's up with England fans? You guys really think England are superior like that, man and that's cap
Kasper’s use of the English language is better than Harry Kane’s.
It was never going to be a clever or witty comeback was it? Harry needs to do his talking on the pitch, to shut schmeichel up.
This story won't end well, I'm telling you right now.
Hahahaha about time someone said it!
This video deserves zero views
Harry kane should of said no but your team is going home.
What a question by a typical stupid reporter. These people are arseholes
Harry Kane got the personality of a dried leaf the guy is legit a talking head
When people say its coming home it refers to the world cup, not the euros.
C'MON DENMARK
Boring response
I kept asking myself wtf do they mean when they say it's coming home, they've never won it. Kasper is a savage
Kasper have more respect for your home  country that's put the food on your table and because of that let's hope we can reflect after tonight and ram it down ,let's hope kane ads to is 16 goals you already ad to pick out the back of the net
What have denmark ever won?
I hope England get twatted!!!!
It's 2 games away, for BOTH Demark and England, and if Demark gets it right, they will go through too.  Not sure what Harry Kane was trying to imply.
Top banter. It just makes the wait for the outcome greater. The reporter must have been from the SUN.
We’ll beat Denmark and then get schooled by the Itailians! 👊 We’re going home….AGAIN
Best ting about this clip is the Asian ting lol ha ha ha
Think kanes scored 14 past him before so no reason he can't score more
Embarrassing reporting by the fraudulist , deserved to be embarrassed like that 🤣
People in Ireland (besides supporting Wales and Scotland) have been supporting Italy since the beginning. Why? Because Italy knocked Ireland out of the 1990 world cup. I dont understand it either
Kasper is right in that England have never won the Euros. As for people saying "England invented football, so its coming home", there are about 20 countries who claim to have invented football. Historically England have claimed whatever they "liked" even if it wasn't theirs, so l wouldn't hang my coat on that line either. Lastly, come on Denmark!
Ridiculous questions put to both players. Kasper was dead right to put that stupid question where it belongs, fair play to Harry kane for talking football and not childish rubbish like that.... Its coming home.... My ass.
The trophy is coming HOME To ROME  FORZA 🇮🇹
Harry Kane has fixed my insomnia😄
I just wish our English bloody media would stop banging on about it coming home. It doesn't do us any favours at all, and just motivates our opponents  🙄
God the media are such dick heads.
France and Italy were my picks at the start of the tournament but Italy looked absolutely knackered yesterday. Spain ran them ragged for 120 minutes. I’m not sure they’ll fully recover by Sunday. If England can get the job done tonight within 90 minutes I think it will give them a much better chance. Also Italy aren’t as good without Spinazola so maybe it really is coming home 😉
I just hate that question , its not England trophy, it belongs to every country if they win
technically the its coming home song relates more to denmark than england for the euros.
The English media and punditry is embarrassing and boring. During matches it’s clear they only watch the prem as they rarely know any players outside it. When they cover a game they also do nothing but talk about England, they should do their job and give analysis on the game they are watching.
English invented football. I love how foreigners believe everything on the internet about England haha they are so lost what England is hahah
Its often forgotten that Kasper grew up mostly in England
It's coming Rome
Well, we know Kane loved 'The Last Dance' documentary about Michael Jordan, so maybe he's going to take this put down personally and it's all he'll need to knock a few past Schmeichel.
Harry will be even happier when he sticks a couple past him!!
Kane just looks so relaxed 👌
Kasper was spot on for it to come home we first had to have won it ..  wrong cup to sing about
Solid, sensible. A captains  retort from Kane.
Kane is a boring nasal sounding drone
Schmiechel has won one fa cup and he’s giving it the biggen hope we batter them
Kasper cheeky confident smile Kane serious look and more worried as is the norm with England in big games of football
Why is Joey Essex reporting on Sky Sports??
1966… it wasn’t a goal.
Epic burn from Kane
I believe the words are « football is coming home ». One thing we cannot deny; football comes from England. And tonight, football is coming home!
Mark Wright is ridiculous  i feel
His father had won it before. Hope Denmark go to the finals.
Yeah obviously
Reporters should realise that they are not trolls on twitter like ffs do your job and be professional for ONCE
Denmarko
Just do your talking on the pitch Harry... Better to be known for your world class ability than your witty remarks
"Has it ever been home" seems to comment on the arrogant notion that football belongs to anyone. What gall to define yourself as "home" of a sport. Especially when you play kinda boringly and your fans are both such aggressive losers and condescending winners. Football loses if that wins, so go Denmark!
I'm English and Kasper was right media etc are all FKING clowns 🤡
Come on England 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 can’t lose this time. It’s coming home.
It does sound arrogant to sing the song when its before even the semi final but I think this song has been taken out of context. I believe the song was about the "game" coming home ie "Footballs coming home" when the Euros were hosted in England
Well we all know it’s never been to Denmark LOL
Has it ever been home?? It's coming home like that world cup in 2018
No one likes the English that’s why saying it’s coming home is just a real douchebag thing to say the English hype themselves up if any team deserves to win the tournament it’s Italy 🇮🇹
Such a boring reply. Wish they put Grealish on to clap back
How is it possible Kasper can speak better English than Harry ?? My 13 month old son is more articulate than Harry Kane.
1992 vs 1966 HAHAH
Kasper was speaking the truth, no one can deny that
Wtf
It wasn’t a put down. You guys are making stuff up now
The guy is spot on hes living his own dream getting to the semi finals for his country and all reporters care about is England im sure it gets abit frustrating
Come on boys 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
The audacity of the press say it came home in 66 is incredible really
2-0 DENMARK. JUST WATCH RIO FERDINAND last night so arrogant like he's been in a SEMI FINAL BEFORE with ENGLAND
Love to see the mate who started the whole"it's coming home" thing😂
The question is how many goals as Harry Kane Scored Past Kasper Schmeichel. So far in history. They should be talking about that before the main match today.
It seems that many people in England, a country that have fostered so many good comedians, are not able to take a good joke.
Kane with a hilariously witty response...
Kaspar the daddy's boy
I understood Kasper  but not Kane.
Football's coming home, didn't Scotland get eliminated?
I've always been led to believe football’s coming home means back to it's roots, where it begun
Kasper is spot on. A quality keeper and articulate bloke. As for him not looking happy? Quite the contrary. He was bantering. Denmark actually won this competition didn't they?
English media being cocky and jinxing it for them again.
Great stuff, riveting 🧐
Maybe don't ask stupid questions?
He's obviously missed the point of the song
Put down? The question was extremely arrogant and ignorant. If anything he should have went harder at the reporter for asking such a disrespectful and self absorbed question. Also the first part of his answer was clearly given a joking manner.
Mark Wright's veneers fell out at the end.
Casper .....born in England....show some respect
I want maddison to smash one past schemical just for club jokez
Harry Kane, he just oozes personality doesn't he? So funny and witty. I wish I was as charismatic as him.
hahaha kasper was spot on hahahaha
Disrespectful asking Kasper rubbish like that. His Dad was in goal when Denmark won the Euro's, something we haven't won.
Of course Kasper is right, but it was just bants. He's been here long enough to know that but honestly the reporter was the moron, why not ask Kasper what would this mean to Denmark if they get to the final? Not sure why he brought up it's coming home? Bit weird and perhaps needs sacking for asking dumb questions.
Come on England today  beat Denmark please don't mess it up play well in the second half and first half we all know you can do it we got faith in you
Kasper seems like more of a English guy than Harry kane 😂😂
No chance
Why does England,think it's the home of everything, Wimbledon is the best tennis comp,the open is the top golf, lord's is the home of cricket,bla,bla bla,and only for Russia and America ,they would be German now.
"Kasper not looking happy when asked that question". What on earth are you talking about? He was only too delighted to answer it with cold hard facts.
Come on England 👍🏆⚽️,come in Home ( we did before in world cup which, ;bigger and harder)
I right barrel of laughs is he 🙈
It's coming home. It's coming home....
Boring hell Harry, have some banter mate
"It should be enough, to get us over the line" - arrogance.  See Rafa Nadal as an example of how to conduct yourself without arrogance. Lack of intelligence.
It better not come home
Ooh, Danish friend
Oh ouch kasper feel that burn of a response....🙄🙄🙄
Harry Kane just sounds like a robot, absolutely no emotion
I suppose it was just far too much to expect a boring, humble non media-trained response with a bit of personality thrown.
But he didn't respond?
Let’s face it, regardless of what happens “it’s going to Rome”
1-0 to Denmark, even before the match has started!!! Goalscorer: K. Schmeichel ;)
Kasper is legend like his Father 🔥👌🏻😁😂
I thought "football is coming home" was in relation to the fact we invented the game. Football was born here.
Harry Kane responding with his usual wit and humour.
I am so hoping and praying that the English bottle it tomorrow. You lot are so obnoxious!
"Schmeichel's put down of England"? The reporter asked if his job tomorrow would be to stop a trophy "coming home" to a country that never won it. He's just defending his flag.
Come on Denmark! They've definitely been the form team of the tournament. Get them guffs telt!
Wat a answer,has it ever been home,brilliant
Both forgot to put those coke bottles in the bin.. Disgraceful 😆
Lol its footballs coming home not the cup .What league does Schmeichel play in the Danish league no .He plays in England the home of football
Hahaha it not coming home for u guy coz it never been home before  up Italy
Actually neither Kasper Schmeichel or Harry Kane should be put down because of this stupid question. The question says everything about the journalist and not much about the players. Still Sky things it is okay not to see the next part of it, where the journalist ask what it would been to stop England...another stupid question. Of course the players think more about what it will mean to their own country and to themselves as a team/person. What about taking your journalists to school?????
Good on you Casper.
Well he didn't put down England at all
Classic Harry Kane witty retort, top banter
That was such a stupid question from that journalist, Schmeichel handled with class actually. He could have berated that guy and asked him to pull his head out of his own ass before asking the next question.
My boi The Unfriendly Ghost
Be nice for England to sniff the trophy and get pumped out by Italy. Hopefully tonight’s game wont give them that sniff. It was never home and never will be as the game was started in Scotland. It’s like england fans don’t know how to google this, or have, and still sing that ridiculous song 😂. Be a long time if ever til it actually comes HAME, UP THE ROAD
Kasper is just taking the piss everyone needs to chill.
😂😂😂 na he violated these english are to hype singing it's coming home already stfu
The song says football is coming home and last time i checked the world Cup is football so yes it has been home 🤷🏾‍♂️
Typical SKY stirring things up again, trying to provoke a response.  You are just a rubbish TV and news Channel.
wow brutal
Kaspar Schmeichel should just shut up because England won the World Cup while Denmark won the Euros. England will WIN and unless Denmark pulled a page from Southgate's playbook, we will never be embarrassed ever again.
Kasper has just plummeted in my estimation - FU
Kasper 😁 nailed 👌
Exactly its never been home
Lol people think the coming home thing is because of winning it no ITS BECAUSE WE INVENTED FOOTBALL AND ITS COMING BACK HOME
Harry has such a dead personality
Harry Kane, go to sleep mate
It was a stupid question to ask Kasper, that team have been through a lot emotionally and this is the only thing he can think of to ask him.. If England loses, it'll be more stupid and embarrassing!!
Just a funny line from kasper, he should of just laughed at it not give some media trained response 🙄, make him pay tonight Harry 😂
Has it ever been home 😭😭😭😭
The song isn't referring to bringing the trophy back home (because we've never won it), it's referring to England inventing the game football and bringing the game home.
It's coming Rome
That reporter should lose his job for being so thick and uninformed about the Euros.
Daily reminder that Denmark have actually won the Euros before, unlike England.
The song is taken out of context! As baddiel and skinner said the “tournament is coming home I.e footy was invented in England. It was never meant to be the trophy coming home
About time england won the euros. Sterling man of the tournament for me. (Scratch that, not after that shameless dive )
Football coming home is a reference to the fact football was born in England.  I hear so many scandic players and fans coming out with this crap.
If ever the English players needed anymore motivation.. Play that clip of Kasper to each and everyone of them.
He said, she said, he said.
Nice try Kasper.
That is why everybody is against u guys winning it
So just imagine this: Your country is in the semi finals of a major competition and has a chance of reaching the final in a long long time, the players are in their highest spirits,the fans are excited too and then a question gets hurled asking about the chances of your opposition country reaching the Finals, that's just frustrating to say the least and Kasper responded aptly to that ridiculous question.
U guys should just wait till u win the competition instead of is coming home that u guys are not sure of yet
Tbh the reporter was disrespectful to kasper
Well said Harry, kept it diplomatic. Actions speak louder so put a couple of ⚽️‘ s past him tonight  . 🦁🦁🦁🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
The most over hype national team
If I was England manager and we win tonight I'm going in front of him and I'm doing the same celebration Jose did after beating juventus  👂👂👂
