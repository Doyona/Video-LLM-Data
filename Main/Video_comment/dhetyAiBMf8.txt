Is that kingdom hearts music playing sometimes in the background or is it just super similar?
... Milotic   If you know, you know
I was studying for my midterm on ancient empires & literally was studying the Roman Empire as Jan mentioned it, and I had a heart attack. (Yes, I know this comment is 2 years late)
30:31 buddy really attacked while it used bide…
You two are such a good duo lol I love your energy with each other
Was that Lethal league music in the intro? Peak!
Oh Man we ran into someone with a mewtwo ☹️ -Dang man! Ya and 3 dragon rage mons -DAYUMMMMMM😳
Did @PointCrow just made a @MegaMogwai  reference?
SLUGMABALLS!!!
jaiden and alpharad ahh run
y'all need a redemption storyline, it would be great to see you two soul linked with at least equitable RNG. love this pairing
The mystery dungeon music in the background is peak
They be talking about splash and spike moves. what happened to "Dig Theory"?
pChal: "I've got balls"  Point Crow: "I do too but not in-game"  LOL
Wait do you not play with type claws
this felt kinda weird ngl
1:39 why the QR code kinda look like a shotgun
The encounter rng in this reminds me of Jaiden and Jacob soul link with him getting legendaries left and right and her just scraping by 🤣🤣
don;t get anyone pregnant. Both of you need to just pack it up for the greater good
Was flygon in this race and never uploaded the video?
I just got into this content, what Room are they playing?
20:52 its pronounced conical
No way that the Cyndaquil option was randomized to Cyndaquil
this shit was hilarious
Listen to Cartmans voice in the WOW episode of South Park. Then listen to one of your videos. See the unbelievably cringey (i hate that word) similarities. Now change it. Thanks man.
The problem with randomisers is that they completely invert the difficulty curve. Starts a ball buster and the end is a walk in the park.
I love how underhanded the intro is, he didnt use a clip of pointcrow making any plays to show he's actually good but instead just a clip of him running in game
nobody else see the shiny ditto at 31:48?
I love Jan’s reaction to the bat, its truly beautiful
Your editor is great for including that jojos reference with the hand
Pcrow had horrific luck in this one
"you flatter me"         he wasnt
encouter luck for jan is pure skill
Saying Rabies is extremely deadly is an understatement actually. It has a 100% MORTALITY RATE WITHOUT TREATMENT FOR HUMANS. It is no fucking joke. It also has a 100% mortality rate after symptoms occur. Inversely, if it's treated before symptoms occur/before the virus reaches the brain, it has an almost 0% mortality rate. So, please, if you ever even think there's the slightest chance you were bitten or scratched by a rabid animal, or that any saliva could have gotten into an open orifice/wound, go to the hospital IMMEDIATELY. If left untreated, YOU WILL DIE. Rabid animals will almost always behave in unusual ways after being infected. Staring up at the sky, spinning in circles, falling over, spasming, being seen in places they normally shouldn't be, like seeing a raccoon walking around your front yard in the middle of the day, with people around, acting unafraid and walking straight towards you, etc.  Regardless of behavior, though. If you're ever attacked by a raccoon, squirrel, bat, dog, or any other animal, you should always go to the hospital and be tested for rabies. It is far too deadly to gamble on.
For randomizers, toggling on 'gyms are a random TYPE' drastically reduces how often you bump into dragon rage, but for a RACE its definitely still just RNG vs RNG
Point crow looks like a lower rizz adam friedland
Pchal encounters so good, he got zubat IRL
"hey, was that battle as good for you as it was for me? 😉" lmaooooo
Jan playing both save files is real G shit. And like the real G he is, he skimps over it like it’s nothing.
Why didnt they get articuno?
pChal is Kira Yoshikage confirmed?
Why would Eric accept the invite to this knowing he didn't have the time..... Kinda just shat on you
oil up or shut up
IDK if you're using different rules than other soul links I've seen but linked pokemon can't have the same primary so sharpedo and seaking can't be chosen together.
I'll be honest, whoever didn't disable Dragon Rage (/Sonicboom) in the rando settings messed up.
25:10 me when I lie (its using uproar)
White Nancy Jackson Richard Perez Richard
Yan goin to get his girlfriend to rescue him from the bat is  way to funny id have just got a shovel 😭🤣🤣
Omg point crows rng is worse than mine holy shit
Yeah yous got fucked hard at the start, that maganuim was unkillable with that rng i think 😭
First
Your ad plugs suck
you take a like and a comment good sir, boost the algorithms to celebrate your determination
2:07 Just casually "oh hey, an Articuno". Just an Articuno. Casually
Crow had a negative luck stat
Bro that bugsy team for pchal💀💀💀
Why run from Articuno?
Shame he had to run from that crobat encounter. But then again that new move "rabid fang" has a 30% chance to proc rabies. It just wasn't worth loosing the run and having to start all over. Just getting back to adulthood after a run ender takes nearly 2 decades as it is. Then he would have to redo his entire poke-tuber skill tree, and reaquire the professional nuzlocker ability. And that would just be a huge hassel.
THE PILOT SOUND EFFECT LMAOOOOOOOOOO
Pointcrows such a cutie, of course he'll find a girlfriend
Is... is he really doing a raid promo.   Ew.
So what's up with Registeel's previous level up moveset having Explosion being a lv. 1 move, but later generations having it be the last thing it learns
Right off bat, Articuno, Registeel, HoOh lmao
Jan was Alpharad and Pointcrow was Jaiden, lol.
25:38 No, Since this is a randomiser you have a lion in your room. 🦁
I've been playing since red and blues release, so many many years experience, yet I never knew you could use the computer in the hideout to switch off the statues ... My mind has been blown.  I am never looking at the hoards of zubat drowzee and rattata again 😂
I drink pp Jan
i thought soul link nuzlock you couldn't have the same primary typing...
Point crow hitting a ground type move on water type Mudkip really drives that death home
26:03 I didn't know Jan was left handed.
30:27 That smile got wiped off his face
With all the legendaries you got, I was reminded of jaiden and alpharad's soul link
No way Jan got bit by a bat and no one noticed and then died on camera from rabies in this video.
A wild zubat appeared
I love raid so much! But I need them to keep sponsoring my Favourite youtubers before I will download and spend money on the game
do this again
They got nerfed and still almost won
What game or rom hack is this?
at what point does point crow learn the type chart
Honestly the fact that they had to restart twice & were only slightly behind, while 1 of the players was screwed by rng & getting nothing compared to legendaries, pretty impressive attempt
Poor PointCrow had to deal with 2 dragon rages, only to get hit by a mewtwo
Komm, lass die Fledermaus in Ruhe, die ist nützlich. Frisst die mücken
No Raid shadow legends got to my boy Jan
all the teams need to battle on showdown at the end of this to determine the real winner
2 of my fav streamers 🤯
I dont judge jan for being scared of the bat. Rabbies is no joke!
Did anyone see the shiny ditto?
PointCrow was literally so useless this whole run lmfaooo
Idk why PCrow and PChall are two of my favorite YouTuber/streamers yet so different in personality which makes their interacting golden
Is that a shiny ditto? 31:47
Everything being randomized makes it completely uninteresting.
His girlfriend is a hand 😂
Another great video, I would love to know if you ever heard of Pokemmo and whats your opinion on it
32:39 I was a classics major in undergrad: every god damn day. And I don't even study latin anymore. I study modern Korean history. o-o
The bat thing happened to me last year. I was playing among us and it came out of nowhere and started dive bombing me. I had to leave and I called animal control to get it out but they sent fire fighters instead for some reason???? The fire fighters got it out of my house after making a bunch of Batman jokes and I was voted off the ship in among us… and humiliated because a whole fire truck was parked outside for one bat….
Raid Shadowlegends is a bad moneysink game that doesnt give you anything for your money it makes me not want to watch yoir video while knowing You promote this crap. :0
Can someone link the race please
I'm voting for Nidoran♀
I now understand why you hate randomizers with nuzlockes because wow Crow's luck was awful every time 💀
Holy fuck dude, the rng was so against y’all, the encounters and the gym pokemon, it’s so rough bro
I don't really care about pokemon or nuzlocking, but i come for the raid shadow legends sections. love that game innit
Is that Amp Plains I heard in the background? As usual, Pokémon mystery dungeon music makes the video even better.
This is phenomenal content. Great work both haha
I didn't get the girlfriend being a hand joke till I read the comments 😅
Who were the other teams and did they make videos too?
It never ceases to amaze me how carelessly Pointcrow plays Pokémon
You ever considered doing anything with Colosseum and/or XD?  I feel like there's a challenge run that could make those SO intense, a randomizer would be limited but interesting. I wonder, could some amazing modder put Pokemon from Stadium 1/2 in there? Cause that would further change things.  Vanilla is great already if you can figure out the right rules though, if a bit predictable once learned. Perhaps some coin flipping stuff to determine which pokemon you may catch?
The Hardest Nuzlocke is the FNAF World Hard Mode, No Giftboxes Nuzlocke, Trust.
Pointcrow w the disable …
damn half way thru the video im feelin so bad for pointcrow man, and for pchal to not even be able to enjoy his encounters caus pointcrows were so bad aaah ya hate to see it
When losing “this is so weird”
You should try and get MandJTV to do a 2 player Nuzlocke with you
Have you ever considered a temtem nuzlocke? I would really love to see you crack said puzzle.
The thing with the bat happened to me too lol germany is great
27:28 Really appreciate the Xenoblade X OST insertion, very nice.
Does anyone know how to set up what they did?
Anyone else notice the chiptune Hideki Naganuma track in the intro to the video?
I 100% expected Crow to make a "Slugin Ma Balls" joke after asking PC to repeat Slugma's name.
"I'm going to use Psybeam" "You want to octazooka actually" "Oh really, for accuracy right" "that, and just damage really.." 😅
Not knowing  how disable works is a bad day lol
Pointcrow thought he could use healing items in battle lol
Man, Jan is getting as many legendaries as Jacob did in his Soul Link with Jaiden XD
Random new encounter in your own room and instead of catching the useful Zubet you just Run away safely? Your title is at risk for sure... :-D
Who allowed Dragon Rage? What a dumb decision
26:00 Wait, your "girlfriend" is a hand? ...right.
Been watching so much Ironmon that I forgot you could know enemy move lists in advance.
Everyone loves Dragon Rage until the enemy uses it on you. 🙃
How does he stay under the level cap so easily? Whenever I do randomized runs, they over level from battles and idk how to turn off or slow down exp gain
btw at 11:48 garchomp only got rough skin as a hidden ability in gen 5 so it wasnt a factor to consider!  :D
16:57 sr a second garchomp has hit the field
You guys should try to finish your saved files if you still have them or do another hardcore soul link again
They could have won if it wasn't for that meddling bat.
You don't even need to have been bit a drop of infected salvia in your mouth, nose, eyes, ears, or broken skin can kill.
Why did he run from the first encounter? Isn´t the first encounter on route 29 a guaranteed catch?
No way Eric asks about the Roman Empire. I can't believe this stupid meme also made it into an Austrian newspaper.
💙💙💙
Don’t tell smallant you talked to point crow
Are they disqualified?
I can agree, as a kid I liked water sport but realized when I got older how dumb the idea was, like fire is already not effective on water and I don’t even think it effect lasts after the mon is switched out
I see your death’s door music there at the end!
22:14 does anyone know the ost/song?
27:27 - 29:51 not every day I run into people using the Xenoblade X soundtrack
calling swallot a gulpin? lol
wait i thought in soulinks you can only have one of each type? so seaking/sharpedo pairing wouldnt work? or did i make that rule up myself
Jan shlda asked smant instead
Why does mud sport even exist lol
Are we going to talk about the RNG difference between Crow and PC. I know that randomizers can be crazy in terms of variability but the difference between their runs and encounters is night and day. Including a bat encounter that had him off acreen for a sizeable amount of time. Seems suspicious.     I dont care either way, just an observation.🤷‍♂️
An impressive showing despite everything. Ya'll should be incredibly proud of that placement.
Smant>
Once again RSL spending 90% of their budget in marketing 😂 I feel bad for their m serious players
I still have no idea what a soul link is
You two have amazing synergy
Love the vids my dude. Found you about a year ago and I’ve binged the main channel so we’re starting on daily’s when I work
Aint no way he using the xenoblade x soundtrack
Jan, consider consulting a doctor for a rabies shot. If you find a bat in your house, even a small scratch when you’re sleeping could be enough. That’s the standard, especially for children
why is pointcrow only using special attacking moves on his skarmory im so triggered asfafs
I feel like switching out to sceptile was a throw. It outspeeding chomp meant it coudlve gotten two hits in. Same with Seaking, getting the horn attack has more value than the supersonic imo
"same egg group"  xD
Dude it's honestly so cringe to see pchal, the goat, playing with these braindead people who seemingly have no idea about anything pokemon
Duuuuude, this is what happens all the time when my brother and I try randomizers... his encounters are never nearly as good as mine.
Insane rng on the garchomps in gyms, i would have been so damn tilted
@ 11:04 And that’s why most players use Dragon Rage Clause at the start of Nuzlockes. That means any early death that happens because of Dragon Rage doesn’t actually count. It’s very unlikely your Pokémon have over 40 HP at the start of a Nuzlocke.
Wow! Super lucky catching that Zapdos. Congratulations Jan.
Sweet way to end the video, awesome writing man!
Point crow has impressed me with the misplays. Of course  my Pokémon Challenge knowledge has been raised to a ridiculous level because of this channel. Also beat my first nuzlock. Cynthia almost got me but hobbled through with 3 mons left standing
I will say the luck in this game is just unbelievable
lawak bot
The hesitation in the gf question means that point crow won't get a gf 😂
damn i watched the first half of this a week ago then had the busiest week of my life and just now finished watching the second half. What a fucking story holy shit
Saw the slugma encounter and it reminded me that me and my friend call it “mini magcargo”
The ruins I believe randomizer wise counts each version of unknown as it's own pokemon so roughly 26 different pokemon there, not too positive I have been nuzlocking jhoto recently
you know, somehow i missed the part where it was a race, so when he said "we were 1 hour behind the competition" I went "wait it's a race?"
I just started the video but they both started with water types.... I thought it was a soul link
Lol your girlfriend is your hand
Cant believe pchal has a gf I thought he was gay for the longest time good for you dogg
The girlfriend just being a hand was a nice touch
I'm so confused because soul link has some rules that were broke in the first minute of the video
"Holy shit theres a bat in my room, im terrified" Jan said calmly
One guy sounds like he knows what he's doing, the other guy sound like hey!!! This is good right!?
Love your videos man. You guys were a great team.
Asome intro bro
Love that music cue on the Tailow encounter XD
this video shows the 2 ways a randomizer can go... either insane unbelievable luck or horrible and garbage luck
The bite thing is legit, hematophage bats have numbing saliva, its really easy to miss a bite, better safe than sorry.
Wow. That was some Jaiden/Alpharad tier luck disparity.
Wait, how did a bat even get in his room?
TAILOW
Did you forget that alpha ruins has different forms of unown? Randomizer usually randomize each form independently. If you can't capture the base one for dupes clause, go and do the one puzzle available to get some more possible encounters.
2 player nuzlocke but you battle at the end to see who is the true champion
Clearly Jan forgot to put on his repel since he got jumped by a Zubat
Lmao, how did a bat get in Jan's room?
Karma hitting big, good job you don't use legendaries on your runs
To be fair, the Roman Empire was well known for its pokemon battles in the coliseum
Does that mean.. i also.. have a bat in my room!  Did not expect that😂
Damn, Jan had to fight a Salamance. But luckily he led with Heatran and not a Palkia.
Is it just me or is the primary fire type heatran being paired with the primary fire type combusken an illegal pairing?
i dont even know if it was intentional but jan's girlfriend being a hand was comedy gold.
There's something people should know, I discovered it short time ago: You can use the PC in the Rocket hideout from the side without having to fight the scientist
What are the rules you guys use? 45 pokeballs in the beginning? And picking whichever starter? I thought picking a starter was linked as well, so if one takes the right, the other must as well
these randomisers are so dumb when every second pokemon is a legendary.
That one dude that can't take a joke?
22:12 can someone explain the joke? i’m a little lost but i recognize the song!
Can u update ur ds emulator guide do u use the new desmume 9.13 os r u still on 9.12, and do u not not plan to switch to melonds
So i have had two bats in my room one i hit with a tennis racket the other i caught with a blanket BTW was in a dorm and there is nothing funnier than 6.5 roommate with a six pack screaming like a girl  I also screamed but it was more holy shit as it flew past my head
Point crow is trash no thanks
For anyone confused, the concern with the bat is that, as bat bites are extremely tiny (look it up- they're pinpricks), it's possible for a rabid bat to bite someone in their sleep without them noticing. The chance of a bat in your house being rabid and biting you is extremely small, but rabies WILL kill you if it isn't treated before you show symptoms. Yeah, you'll notice if you're awake and a bat lands on you, but you might not if you're asleep.
Watch out PointCrow might make a video crying about any small thibg you say
That was such a smooth sponsor transition Im rolling
You should play Pokémon emerald Ironmon
Why was Darkrai named Kenya?
uproar famous electric type move
What happened with hating randomizers huh Jan?
Raid's infected Pchal too omg
I saw the Mudkip go Bide and when Crow switched Marowak in and I was like  “Oh, he knows how Bide works, this is gonna be a Tail Whip and an easy kill”  And then I saw him go for Bone Club 😶
yeah rabies is 100% deadly if not treated early and its also a very very painful death. you start to get spasms, cant swallow anymore(thats where the foam comes from) and its very gruesome :s wouldnt recommend. if a wild animal scratches you or bites you, go to the doctor. :)
What emulator does Jan use? On 32:06, the font used and the fact that it can be Unlimited rather than 4.0x means it's not desmume?
at 2:11 are they playing the same game? how did they do that?
That level9 Garchomp was a menace
Jan's effort on a manscaped ad compared to the raid ad really shows
I had to like this video simply from the girlfriend joke! Lol
THE ROMAN EMPIRE MEME HAHAHAHA
sorry to dox you Jan, but bro lives in mt moon
can't believe jan found a zubat in real life
Pointcrow had Seaking and Marowak as starter choices in Attempt 1 and 3. Some weird other random rolls too...
Such a cute thumbnail, kudos to the artist
Everytime I do a randomized nuzlocke of these games I get all the legendary for all the routes until first gym if I’m lucky I get 1 route without legendary but barely happens
Pkmn challenges was so lucky to get the “Worlds Greatest Nuzlocker” on his team 😊😊🤯🤯🔥🔥
Bat in room. GET A RABIES SHOT
That taillow pilot meme got me good ty editor ily
Exited to see you play “Pokémon too many types” from alpha rads team of modders
I always love hearing Kingdom Hearts tracks for bg music 🔥
Rabies, once you start exhibiting symptoms, is deadly. Full stop. You cannot survive. Get the shot.
came for the pokemon soulink stayed for the bromance lol
eric is so high key compared to jan, it's funny to see them side by side
The first encounter would have worked, Claydol doesn’t learn self-destruct until 19 and learns explosion somewhere around 30-40, so sad they left my boy
Lol @32:42 I asked my dad, who is a really stoic hard ass kinda guy, if he thought about the Roman Empire and he said nope but than he said he wished he had said all the time because he actually had heard of the meme which was honestly funnier and more surprising than the outcome.
Anyone know where to get that rom?
watching this live was so painful. TRULY thought this would be the matchup to win but that RNG was insane
One of these days… FlygonHG. The self-proclaimed best nuzlocker vs the actual best nuzlocker.
He should hve named the Mon paired with tailow “pilot” and not said anything
Rest in peace Jan, it was so tragic that he contracted rabies from the small, numbing bite of the bat
blame yourself when you get rabbies
the dead silence after "we dont use healing items in battle" lmao
Good outro music, I enjoyed that crow game
25:08 Uproar is an electric type attack ?
Went to get gf lol that’s sort of sad NgL
Is your girlfriend a sister of pointcrows girlfriend? They look to similar.
Losing uxie to a biding mudkip is such a rookie move 😂
Man why didn’t you catch that zubat encounter in a nuzlocke
This why you should only randomizer soul link with the king of luck alpharad
Why is your gf a right hand lol?
Seeing a lv Registeel for those who know: RUN. RUN NOW.
Haha I was watching live on kidds stream when the bat was in your room.... I'd forgotten about that 😂
The girlfriend in the Zubat story being just a hand is an underrated joke lmao
That first run singlehandedly made Jan's distaste for randomizers make sense.
good vid
Yeah, i really like soul links :D
"I will say I did not miss-play that so that was luck" 😂😂😂😂
wow i forgot how insanely unfunny pointcrow is
did anyone else, completely bereft of the context of the other streamers/youtubers that are also doing the race, have no idea that Jan and PC were racing anyone until PC mentioned that they can "catch up" around 7 minutes in?
Love it 👍
I Hope people react to this nuzlocke
Alright everyone be nice to PointCrow in the comments or he’s going to make Jan cry on stream in a few months
Pchal did the calcs in his head and was able to confidently tell the crow bro that his chances of getting a girlfriend were greater than zero
I think it’s a bit too edited to understand what’s going on you skipped a lot
really fun watch
PILOT!!!
Most scuffed soul link
I really think that if they are to make a race out of a randomizer they should at least use some of the balancing randomizing settings (very easy to add). Especially for the legendaries (just remove them).
Bro missed out on Crobat irl. It happens to the best of us
Yo the bat actually made me wake up my gf this morning I was laughing so damn hard
I'm fairly certain the scientist next to the button in the rocket hideout was optional.
gotta love the pro nuzlocker getting carried by legendaries by rng and then pcrow plays expertly with the hands he is dealt
no randomizers should be allowed to have dragon rage like that, it shouldve been taken out in generation.
being scared of the bat is actually pretty reasonable. You do NOT want to fuck with things that can carry rabies
Can I humbly request you to start Eric -Pchal 😂
I love how despite how bad the situation/luck was throughout the video,  PointCrow remains so completely optimistic and happy. I've never watched his content before now i want to!
not the hand for his gf lmfaoooooooooo im dead hahahahah
If Raid wasn't a gatcha who's primary gameplay is "turn on auto and go away" it might be interesting...  Instead it is that... and also it mandates certain types of characters for certain important fights for progression... no you don't get targeted gacha's, why would they give you that?  Also probably the stingiest with free spins of any "you must have other characters of the star level to empower your characters" gacha I've ever played...  Any one of those problems alone would be enough for me to derec Raid, all of them together, and Raid... is the worst gacha I've ever played.
Eric I'll be your girlfriend ♥️
This video was ludicrously entertaining. Sometimes, two individually entertaining people don't work together - like I think you and Jaiden didn't click all too well with each other f.e. - but you and Pointcrow are a hilarious duo. Him as color commentary, you as the knowledgeable one. Plus, you're both funny and you jump on each others' jokes. I had a great time with your banter. Fuck you, have a good day.
does anyone know what song starts at 27:28?
funny how you never considered just simply playing better against those garchomps
What romhack is this?
25:06 hell yeah I'm gonna nerd comment that uproar isn't akshually an electric type move
Falkner must hate Pointcrow
This was so great to watch. I'm just loving that jan included kh hollow bastion music in this.
Biggest takeaway of this whole video:  Jan is dating is hand :0
Jan pay jaiden to animate this please 🙏🏾
LETS FUCKING GO HE MET ANOTHER SPONSER DEADLINE!!!!
This was so fun. Can't believe how unlucky you guys were at the beginning with the restarts. Low key funny but also a bit sad you got legendaries and Pointcrow didn't. 😆 The bat was crazy though ngl.
The amount of info PointCrow knows is confusing me on how he is an “unskilled” player.
I have a question if you switch consoles during a nuzlocke do you have to start over
We had a bat in our living room some months ago, it had just randomly come in through the window or maybe the garden door, I don't remember what was open at the time. It looked and sounded like a very big moth, and definitely the first time we've had a bat enter our home. We had to turn off all the lights and open the windows and door so it could leave on its own, and not be disoriented by the lights. We've also had a few small birds, either titmouses or blue tits (WHY ARE THEY CALLED THAT IN ENGLISH) which we had to coax outside, one day there was 2 of them, the second of which took TEN MINUTES to get outside while it kept latching itself onto the ceiling with its talons. So now during summer we have to have our garden door open just a little ajar to get fresh air inside, so we don't get freaking random birds and bats in here! Still kinda exciting to get an accidental visitor/intruder like a bird or a bat (or a butterfly) in your living room, like, even though they are scared and confused and I/we obviously don't want them in here, I still kinda like these experiences, something funny to tell about later. XD
I got so confused when I suddenly heard Kingdom Hearts music😂 Hollow Bastion theme haunted my dreams as a kid
I can completely relate to not really wanting to confront a problem, and so you do something not entirely helpful to kind of stall, and then the problem kind of goes away on it’s own. This happened with a bird in my house. I had no idea what to do. So I was like, “Uh… let me go get a broom.” And then when I came back, my wife said she lost it and I was just like, “Huh… weird. Let’s go to bed” lol this also happens sometimes with programming or yard work or really anything. Sometimes problems accidental solve itself and instead of investigating and doing any real work, I just chalk it up to it no longer being a problem and I move on.
I remember when Jan had the bat show up in his room, crow was asking if he was going to get rabies and we went down the rabbit hole of what infectious disease Crow would get, and I said “Gonorrhea Pog” and Crow read it out loud. I’m so glad that little piece made it into this video.
The visual Jan decided to use to represent his girlfriend is a right hand.  Yeah.
I don’t think you would have had a fighting chance if the number of bats was closer to 100
Tail Glow Azelf is sth I wanna have in my game 👀
Can somebody tell me is this a seperate rom or is this just rules u use on a pokegame ?
Radical red hardcore mode will definitely take you 151+ attempts
This was enjoyable
Jfc the bad rng... wait, was Alpharad participating? If so he probably stole all the good luck
Jan with all of the RNG luck..... Eric getting WASHED!!!!
19:11 PointCrow did misplay that though. Disable disables the last move used and the last move was Take Down. It was only randomly selecting a move in gen 1, gen 2 and onwards it disabled the last move the opponent used. So yea, I'd say that was a misplay.
bruh dropped the raid shadow legends in 2023💀💀💀🤓🤓🤓🤨🤨🤓☠️☠️🤔🤔🤔🗣️🗣️🗣️
Juggler bugsy
Jan must not like the RNG-fest that is a randomizer, but through it he and Point Crow had fun! That's more important than the competition!
2:06 skip add timestamp
Wild zubat appears
Jan playing IRL Pokemon while doing his Nuzlocke.
Honchkrow does learn moves by level up and Garchomp can't have Rough Skin because it's a Gen 4 game (unless the randomizer adds it). Just for future reference 🫡
Pchal did NOT try to make a clever plug at all 💀
I'm sorry but I cannot believe this Waa completely unrigged rng looool
Jan, warum läuft vor deinem Video AfD Werbung? 🤨
Cpt. Kid always with the whacky ideas
Geh zum Friseur jeez
PointCrow shouldn't have played if he was gonna leave a SOULLOCK without half of itself......how inconsiderate
When I did a randomized nuzlocke of Black 2, I very quickly established a "Dragon Rage Clause", where early deaths to Dragon Rage do not count. Because that shit just isn't fun.
Crow cheated on Smant i cant believe it😢😢
yo
Anyone know what randomizer mod this is? I really want to play it.
Does Jan still do Nuzlocke reacts ?  Because there is a Youtuber who makes really great Videos on different types of nuzlockes with some wolfey style animation thrown in called Macarjoe. For all the effort he puts into those videos he really deserves the shoutout and traffic of a Pchall reaction
Not disabling dragon rage was a really dumb design choice. Randomizers can be lots of fun, if you get rid of these 'you lose" situations early game.
God Pointcrow is obnoxious. Anything with him is unwatchable for me. Sorry Jan skipping this one.
WHERE THE FUCK DID HE GET A BAT
Hey editor, could you put the team info (like at 22:39) on screen for a little longer?
POG
No way I could deal with a bat
Two player soul link of the best nuzlocker of the world...probably. We eating a lot today
Cool idea for a randomized nuzlocke, you can catch only the trainers Pokemon, one per route/gym, hardcore nuzlocke rules apply
guesswild bats are more dangerous than zoo bats (zubats  :D we have a zoo with a bat cave and I got nibbled on quite a bit there pretending to be a rock :D
considering how fast they catched up, the first 2 resets were indeed kind of a handicap to give others a chance, else they would have been at least 2 badges ahead without reseting.
It's different Unown forms isn't it?
Lmfao the hand as your girlfriend is amazing
Poor pointe crow
Awesome run!
Let’s all hope Jan didn’t get a bite from that zubat encounter
Oh great, another Johto play through 😴
I clicked for the soul link nuzlocke but stayed for the jokes and innuendos. XD
Why is they call you Peach Al
Did Jan change the outro music? Nuuuu
WHAT SINCE WHEN
THEYRE PC^2
Another pchal upload??? My hunger is sated
Congrats on the Trending!
End of the month = 2 Jan videos while he catches up on his ads for the month
Please get a haircut
Rabies is not “extremely deadly.” It is “certain death.”  I LOVE bats. I volunteer at a bat and bird rescue here in Austin. But you HAVE to be careful with wild animals.
Ads less than a minute in 😂
Soul link that means he gets a gf to
His repel in his room ran out  Zubat entered the chat
hollow bastion background music on a pokemon video? Nice!
" I went back to playing children's games with my friend".  Everyone's ideal day!
Wild zubat :0
25:09
Brother you have to do this again it's the most fun to watch!
You see a pokemon use Bide,and what you do? Just hit it twice...what a throw...
22:11 not the emerald kaizo music when point crow ran into taillow 😭  song is “were finally landing” by HOME
Awesome Vid
Long haired Jan, so sexy
hey pchal why is ur chat times new roman
26:02 nice girlfriend ✋
Why were they forced to skip the encounters the first time I don’t get it? Is it no legendaries?
Pointcrow so annoying crikey
Hey just a PSA about bats in your room. If you ever find a dead bat in your room, store it somehow, in like a baggy or something, and take it to get tested for rabies, and then get a rabies shot ASAP. Bat bites can actually be as small as mosquito bites, so a dead bat in your room could mean you were bitten by a rabid bat in your sleep.  However, if the bat is alive and in your room then your problem is that there's a live bat in your room.
The Taillow bit returns lets gooooooo
idk why you cut to alpharad when you talked about friends
part of the rare few in the analytics who searched for the video :)
Going by these encounters, if Jan got rabbies, PointCrow would get like a cold or a headache or something.
Objectively worse move than Water Sport that has an actual effect - Mud Sport. Pretty sure every Pokémon that can learn Mud Sport is either already resistant or immune to electric type moves. At least there’s a small variety of pokemon that can learn Water Sport that are hit super effectively by fire types.  EDIT: Didn’t know they would talk about Mud Sport the literal second after I paused the video to type this lol
26:03   My name is Yoshikage Kira. I'm 33 years old. My house is in the northeast section of Morioh, where all the villas are, and I am not married. I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink. I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone.
Yo Pchal you shoulda sprayed water all over the room, if it has rabies then it'll freak tf out because of the hydrophobia.
The Pilot reference LMAO
Yeah, definitely look into getting a rabies vaccine. If you develop symptoms, you are going to die. It takes a while for symptoms to appear though, so you might forget about this by the time symptoms present.
PointCrow is trash.
Everyone makes fun about Zubat until it enters your room.
Thank you for the video.
Disliked due to raid sponsor
I never get tired of the Taillow meme lmao
The thumbnail looks awesome
Archy luck on legendaries are showing 👀
Question for clarity. At 25:07 PChal comments on PCrow losing his swellow to an electric type attack, with the attact being uproar. Would that not be a normal type attack? Granted, PCrow was using a flying v electric so it was bad either way, but just curious about move typing.
This run doesn't have the stipulation of "your linked encounters can't be used if they're the same type"?
you should really get checked for any bites or possible rabies bro
26:04 wait.. your gf is your right hand?
When did people stop calling a Soullink a Soullink?
4:48 Was that his first time saying that?
The zubat bit was crazy but I can't believe no one is mentioning that Jan used a hand to represent his "gf" 😂
Jan dodged that gulpin joke without even realising XD
I absolutely LOVED the EK Pilot music throwback.
He gets more attractive with every video ngl
Point crow: *Accidently Locks Gabite Into Dragon Rage* Also Point Crow: "I didn't misplay that one"
jan get yourself checked for bites, we don't want covid back again. or rabies, that's bad too, bats have numbing saliva
the taillow bit gets me every single time
What's with that Dragon Rage luck though?
3:22 slugma balls
Please run it back for the redemption arc of pcrow's encounters
cant believe PC teamed with PC in this!
SOME OF MY FAV YOUTUBERS COLLABING?!?!
Jan, you and your girlfriend should both get just-in-case rabies vaccinations. It's very unlikely the bat had rabies, but rabies has a 100% fatality rate if you don't get vaccinated. It's not worth rolling those dice. Just be smart and play around the crit, dude.
I have balls- "I do too but like not in game", bruh I was expecting something serious , had me laughing so bad
Nearly closed the tab when I saw who the sponsor was
You didn't win but you won in my heart
You better both of gotten rabies shots, holy hell. you dont know where it went?? you will not know if a bat bites you
[Jan after I release hundreds of bats into his room]: "We still have a chance"
They have options in randomizers to remove dragon rage/sonic booms.... whoever set this up hates everyone.
This PointCrow guy is WAY better then DougDoug! His perfect gameplay is practically glistening!
PC just willing it into existence that octillery would be fine.
Bats dont really bite ppl
For a man that doesn’t post his videos are goated
Pointcrow got a toothy ass grin
He likes using Crobat saying it's a really good encounter. But not a good encounter in real life apparently 😂😂
Gonorrhoea is not poggers kids.
nice vid as always!!
Should've turned off move animations.
I was today years old when I learned you could turn off the team rocket hideout statues
Bat was a paid actor
Ahhh that death to bide is pain just play around it
Randomizers are so cat piss.
This was a good one. Nice. You and PC vibe.
Would have gotten 1st place if you'd teamed up with SmallAnt
my wife olmost kill me because becuase she tought you where me
25:06 Uproar   My favorite electric type attack.
Loved the Tailow/Pilot Summoning Salt music edit, made me chuckle ✌️
The encounter differences are the same energy as Alpharad luck vs Jaiden luck lol
The worst RNG of all was getting a teammate that was not only bad, but also had to leave early.
You had to be with Pointcrow, the most annoying Pokemon creator
The Pchal-Pointcrow relationship is so heartwarming
I really did enjoy that 5 seconds of thinking about starters.
So did the Bat fly out of your room?
Jan and Pointcrow are good together. Should colab more
That tailow music takes me back
Surprised no one is making the joke about pointcrow cheating like with smallant
watching this videos fun because youll see Pchal have like a regigias named sunkirn, then it will cut to pointcrow with a Stantler named Mewthree
These days i'm so alone just working that I would love to play games with someone.  I'm 23. Everyone that would play is studying while I work in my business most of the time...  I dont like to play single-player because it feels more... Loney?  Sorry, english is not my first language.  I'm just saying that I really enjoy these videos when there are two players or more, it feels good. Thank you!
Bats are HORRIFYING, no shame in being frightened lol
The xenoblade x music showing up in this video threw me off
I know Johto has been beaten to death by now, but seriously HOW are they fighting LEVEL EIGHTEEN TRAINERS STILL at 33:45
25:08  Ah yes, the electric type attack, Uproar.
Haha the Taillow sound
Pointcrow is budget
So he cheats even in races, nice.  Mans just cannot play one single valid Nuzlocke run
8:00 is this... Into the Breach music?? Good choice, editor
the single-second music swell when tailow was on screen was gold
Unironically, get your rabies vaccine NOW if you haven't already.
I really like this duo! pls more!
The kingdom hearts music towards the end at around 31:55 was super nostalgic! Two amazing childhood games and memories into one vid! Salute 🫡
Pc lookin cute today
Bro. You didn't have to out yourself as a beta that needed his gf to help get the bat outta your room 👀
im so pumped for this
Hello Doctor my soul linked partner mabye got a bat bite I need to be checked...
"Should have played around the rabies"
22:12 PILOT IS BACK
Honestly whoever set this race up really done goofed by not disabling dragon rage early game. Most randomizers have the option built in...
Having a soul link where the enemies can have stuff like dragon rage amd stuff early game is super dumb and not well thought out
why is your girlfriend a hand png Jan?
You two made a very funny duo to watch. Unfortunate for the encounters haha
I hope Jen takes that chat members advice and did at least check himself for bites. Bats have numbing saliva and it can actually be extremely difficult to tell if you've been bitten and if you get rabies and you don't realize you got rabies once it gets to a certain point you just f****** die and there's nothing you can do
I am hooked on your videos for a while now, was eagerly waiting for the next post 😊 this was so fun to watch, hope you guys had fun running this
PLEASE GET A RABIES SHOT YOU CAN GET RABIES FROM JUST TOUCHING A BAT AND MOST OF THEM HAVE RABIES!!!
a
Did you get vaccination because of the bat encounter? In Chile vaccination is warranted if you find in your room because of rabies
THE TAILLOW ALWAYS GETS ME ASHUJISDFDJHGSDVHAJSFDFGH
the amount of disappointment i heard in "and i'm paired with pointcrow"
That taillow encounter with we’re finally landing caught me off guard in the best way possible
25:18 I haven't seen Pchal so baffled by something since the Alpharad Onyx incident
two of my favorite poketubers together? NOICE
Always funny when YouTubers have to pretend like Raid Shadow Legends isn’t garbage
"How often do you think about the Roman Empire" only true friends ask that
Garchomp coming from the "banned" grave to haunt Jan now
I get bats in my house all the time, I feel your pain.
seeing pchal playing gen 2 is the highlight of my day
Looks like the bromance with Alpharad paid off. His encounter luck rubbed off on you Jan.
I thought for soul link nuzlockes you weren't allowed to have the same type pokemon on your teams i.e. Seaking and Sharpedo both being Water types. Or am I wrong?
You should do one with young yong!!! Can you imagine the animation :)
not knowing how much time has passed is absolutely killing me
Where’s this Captain Kidd video you speak of?
Bat Gang 🦇🦇🦇🦇🦇
Not even batman could stop your luck 💀
I was actually having a really bad day due to stuff beyond my control, but this video helped me feel better SO quickly. 💖 The absolute abysmal luck PointCrow had and the bat bit with your GF being a hand-- 😂 Whoever edited this is a genius. You guys did so well together! It looks like even though the luck couldn't be more opposite for you two in these runs, you still had fun. 😊 This video came out at the perfect time.
🦇
Ngl i was hoping this was going to be with smant
so sad he died from rabies
No more sweaty and unshaved balls talk 😢
that thumbnail is soo good
Why did you partner with pointcrowe. He’s obviously got the weak mental considering the small ant situation
Comedic timing in moments was hilarious ..  1. point finally defeated gabite, then was like ok here we go we got this - then a level 15 new two appears 2. Pchal telling point to spam swift to damage mew two and no other way - mew two disables swift   Made me laugh that
I will never understand why these random nuzlockes keep legendary encounters on. Imagine how much more interesting this would be if there was no legendaries and no fully evolved pokemon
The hollow bastion music is greatly appreciated (around 34 mins in)
Why did pointcrow schedule an appt at the same time as this event 💀
Dude got zubat IRL like wtf.
Jan suffering the pointcrow luck.  And it isnt like Jan has the best luck either.
I double take everytime I hear pilot’s themesong
This is literally jaiden animations and alpharad part 2 except it's pointcrow and pokemon challenges. One gets really good pokemon the whole time and the other gets the leftovers
You guys should do a two player nuzlocke in Pokeone. There's story co-op, so every battle becomes a double battle. It opens room for a lot of new strategies.
PointCrow probably the whackest streamer to ever do it
Jan finding a real life zubat reminds of that video of the Irish family trying to get rid of a bat in the house.
22:13 i fkin died lmao
how are you in multiplayer? what are you using :o
Also not sure if Jan or the creator of this event  will find this  acceptable but for a nuzlocke most  YouTubers use dragon rage clause which basically means until the second gym if your teamwipes or you lose a mon to Dragon Rage its not seen as a lose so you can keep going with the team or mon that died to it.   Main reason is because if you encouter Dragon Rage in the early game its pretty much GG theres pretty much no win con unless you get super lucky   Oh yes if you have a mon with dragon rage you can't use the move.
They sent a real Zubat after you~~~
Yay
The Pilot edit on Taillow is hilarious 22:11
Shouldn’t skarmory have alternated between swift and peck, if not spammed peck because it was physical and a lot better against mewtwo
25:57Had me rolling 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 Had no idea of Jan has Chiroptophobia (Fear of bats)  Also I feel you guys Randomizer Hardcore nuzlockes are tough.   I mean even if you get amazing encounters or legendaries theres always that one Pokemon you come across that wrecks your entire team. I've only attempted two and failed both😅
I love that the Taillow in-joke continues
22:12 the only moment that mattered
Watching it live and seeing them wipe to the second gym and seeing Drxx having no problems was messed up.
THE SUMMONING SALT MUSIC WHEN POINTCROW FINDS TAILOW LMAO
The man who doesn't like using Legendaries in Nuzlockes, get all the legendaries
Theres no type clause?
The Taillow bit had me dying oh my gosh
If you missed the text on screen: bat bites can be very small and easy to miss, and they're common carriers of rabies, so PLEASE if you come in contact with a bat, go to the doctor. Better safe than anything else, because there is NO CURE for rabies, and if you get it you WILL die, and once symptoms are showing, it's already too late. Take rabies seriously, and don't touch wildlife, even if they're dead.
i love the soundeffekt when crow got tailow. good old e-kaizo
Imagine being that good at Nutzlockes that even Batman is trying to sabotage your run.
bro forgot his repels rest in peace
Man, pointcrow is the worst pokemon player I have ever seen! If pchal had any other parter they wouldn't have withed once
Are they using a multiplayer patched ROM like Quetzal?
I like how every time Taillow pops up it plays that theme and zooms in, In honor of Pilot
the taillow moment made me let out a slight laught
I'm sorry for your loss.
This is Jaiden/Alpharad all over again
Team PC & PC love it !
Best nuzlocker in ge world thinks uproar is an electric tyoe attack
Finish the Smant player controller AI
"Eric losing his swellow to an electric type attack" last time I checked uproar is normal type and all rotoms including the flying type one have levitate
Fantastic video as usual!
I gotta say I’m glad pchal had a higher speed stat and avoided the bats mean look
Here we see the difference in skill levels between a professional Nuzlocker, and an amateur. Jan was able to get good encounters, while the inexperienced PointCrow got shit encounters.
Not the wild zubat hitting challenges with the poison fang toxic proc.
The taillow edit from kaizo haha
Classic Eric L, rare Jan W
Encounters here have huge Alpharad and Jaiden energy
Love the Deaths door theme at the end!!
he is so casual about there being a bat in his room
Loving the script writing these days. Not too dry / bland, but also not full alpharad style tragedy writing. Feels very genuinely you
Haven't watched the whole video yet, but at the beginning I saw both of them in game at the same time, do you guys know how that works
Bird Dad and Daddy Dad in the same video!? Omg 😮❤
Man it wasn’t bad enough that Pointcrow got shit encounters but he played like such dog shit to boot. To attack while something is doing bide is next level brain dead. I guess game knowledge was severely lacking lol
Excellent Duo! I love Pchal and PointCrow and would like to see more in different formats.
That commenter about the bat is actually true. Many bats' saliva numbs the bite so you won't ever feel a thing, especially if you're asleep. Rabies is 100% fatal once sympoms show, so it's better to go to the doctor than not.
Pointcrow- both our teams suck PChal- I have a Zapdos and Staraptor, we are not the same
We need more soul link from both of you!
Raid shadow legends, really pc. You're better than that
So unter uns... musst du wirklich n Raid placement annehmen? Das game ist ultra schmutz, und auch wenn 95% deiner Community das ignorieren, was machst du mit den 5% die sich das echt holen und sogar Geld lassen? Und dem einem der zu nem whale wird? Klar kann man sich immer einreden das sowas nicht passiert, aber das ist ne massive Collab alter klar wirds unter den mehreren Hunderttausend Klicks wahrscheinlich so nen Typen geben, die kommen ja nicht von ungefähr und Raid zahlt ja auch nicht für Werbung weil sowieso niemand das Game runterlädt. NordVPN ist mit dem infinte loop auf der Homepage schon cheesy, meiner Meinung nach aber, wirklich knapp, gerade so noch überschaubar.  Du solltest doch wohl bessere Möglichkeiten haben als so n Müll...
Don’t have time to watch the whole thing rn but liked anyway
0:32 Gulpin DEEZ IZ WRONG
Hi algorithm. Yeah the weather is terrible, isn’t it?
i wonder if the wild bat was shiny or not
i've had 2 bats there nice :D
The ek sound for taillow gets me everytime in every video
22:12 Lol that split second music cut actually got me
You could see the friendship progression throughout this video. PointCrow was calling PC Pchal and after some point he switched to John and PC started calling him Eric.  Edit: John was a meme because PointCrow mispronounced Jan's name as many people do and it sounded (at least to me) like John 😂
The tailor meme gets me every time
Early dragon types are soo broken.
The tailow bit made me spit my drink. Pchaldaily enjoyers know what i mean
3:50 omg that unown dupe clause was hillarious  but how is that even possible? if ant already met a doduo that would mean that 2 different pokemon rolled into doduo which can happen if you code it like that but it seems like a very weird design decision
I feel like this DLC is just prepping for DLC 2  Edit: I don't know how this posted here, I was trying to post to a different video
I love that FlygonHG is your biggest competition.
What if you wanted to beat the nuzlocke  But Arceus said..   Garchomp
Congrats on the Zubat encounter!
The Tailow meme still gets me
that music when he found the tailow.... fly high pilot o7
I LOLd at 22:11
Bromance of the century
You guys don't seem to have the greatest synergy, idk felt like jan was just annoyed the whole time lol.
Who are the other racers? I'd like to see everyone's POV!
Giovanni ass dude. “But he is Giovanni”
Bat encounter irl goes crazy, no matter where you go, you can’t escape Zubat
The bullshit pointcrow gets for comming out about what a larger youtuber did to him makes me so fucking mad
You can feel the oozing disdain for randomizers lol
No way Jan got that wild Zubat encounter.
I love that Raid ads are basically just a free cashgrab for any YouTuber. We all know Raid sucks ass as a game and they make the ad segments in videos so obnoxiously obvious with the onscreen video its easy to skip past em. Tis a win-win.   Oh, also great video <3
I do so love PointCrow collaborations while committing first degree murder on a family of four.    For those not in the know search youtube for "Pointcrow family of four"; I guarantee you'll laugh!
PC uploads are a love/hate relationship. I love watching the videos. I hate having watched the video because now I can't watch it first time again
After all that bad luck, PointCrow Deserves a Girlfriend.
Youtube decided this is leafgreen/firered..... uncultured swine
Ok, the thumbnail is really good
The dragon rage users thing is just crazy to me
I can't with raid, it's a mediocre rip off of clash of clans when you're not in battle, including the multiple days wait times for upgrading buildings, and when you are in battle it's one of those games that automatically fights for you unless your characters have a skill ready, then you tap them to use it. There's no gameplay.
Slugma and Gulpin actually are in the same Egg Group lmao. Impressive
The hand as the girlfriend is crazy 💀
ew pointcrow
EU-friendly upload times
never been this early
3:17 best part
Full health, paralyzed Kyogre with a pokéball on the first try. Just take my like.
Pchal+pointcrow= pchrow
"Dragon Rage Garchomp is cheesy," Jan says, right before PointCrow ends up facing one.
Ok.
"Live by the dragon rage, die by the dragon rage" 🫡🫡
the rng on what enemy mons you guys are facing is nuts xD so tbh with the bat you did the right thing they can have rabis and a lot of other nasty stuff that they can pass on to a person
Oh hey i actually caught one of your videos as it released
Dragon rage was so unlucky my god
Fifty-first! Wait… is that a thing?
I bet no one has finished this video yet
Loving the series of nuzzlockes with other youtubers!
44th !!!! OMG
Sick, this is a cool concept. I'm glad captainkidd triggered this.
YOOO PCHAL SOUL LINK NO WAY AND WITH POINTCROW BROOOO
Algorithm
WOW I LOVEEEEEEEEEEE RAID SHADOW LEGENDS🥰🤩😍
YEAH WHAT A COMBO
I can't believe I'm saying this but I miss the times when everyone was sponsored by RAID
Fhg
I'm a simple man... I see a PC video, I click on it.
Im early & excited, like Jan when he sees a catboy.
I will also contribute to boosting the algorithm.
You guys should have reset waaaayyy earlier than you did. After missing like 3 mons, and having bad mons, not sure why that wasn't the point you decide to.
This is a comment.
Cool
Anybody mess with cock and ball torture?
This looks cool
Can’t wait for PChal to completely ignore the YouTube Comments!
Slugma nuts 🎉
I’m sorry Jan, I’m obligated to skip past any RAID ads I see. However, I will comment for the algorithm’s sake, and I will ensure that I’m both subscribed and hit the bell. Is…is that a fair trade
POG
Can’t wait for the many Pokemon deaths to come from both misplays and killing them in “catching”
The last time I was this early, Mr. Challenges was facing serious allegations. Good to see him doing a collab with the uncontroversial PointCrow!
smash
Yo
Ngl have avoided pointcrow over how he portrayed himself in the smallant drama.. just seemed off vibes wise.
comment here just to boost algorithm or so.
Hi
This is gonna be good
The crow
omg the legendary collab… point challenges!
First
First
First 😆
