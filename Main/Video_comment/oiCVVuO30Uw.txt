with the amount of food on this i don't think it can be called a chuckle anymore, it's more of a chortle
God I got hit in the face when Wilbur appeard, better times when this came out.
Tiny tucker
15:09 AND THIS IS TO GO EVEN FURTHER BEYOND
imagine owning an airbnb and seeing it in a video like this. I would personally be shocked
16:15 Ted makes a One Piece reference
2025 here, when are we gettiong the fuckle sandwich?
15:03 that was a jumpscare 😭
I thought they was gonna eat it until halfway through
i love that they even added Jaiden's little tooth-pickle (yes, i just combined toothpick and pickle.)
hate seeing the Brighton biter
Meatcanyon carried
not them just driving an s class
7:53
I think factor has those
Very interesting issue, as always informative and fun
Why does every youtube channel have a "Tucker" is it the same guy?
Not the Wilbur jumpscare in 2025
changed the video so quick when the biter was mentioned, really had to process what i saw
wilbur jumpscare BOO
20:02 so… what happened to the gun
wilbur foot jumpscare
Ham steaks are pre cooked but why on earth would you eat one without pan frying it
Probably great faded tho
8:59 shlingus must've had a flashback to what he did in '99
Cheers to 100 more my ass lol
The real Chuckle Sandwich.. were the friends we lost along the way❤
Wilbur Soot jumpscare
“It’s an electric stove. Have you done this before?” “Dude your like a fucking asshole to me all the time” “You two are drunk” “IM NOT DRUNK” *starts rumble* Less than one minute later “Ted you were right, it did catch on fire” “Dude what the fuck is wrong with you” The combo
15:09 I forgot that man existed-
HER SISTER WAS A WITCH👹👹
Fun fact for all you uncultured people: barbacoa is actually cow brain
The fact that I'd still eat this is a testament to how fat I am.
I expected schlargus not to know how to cook but TED?
LUDWIGS A LOSER WHO DOESNT DO TIER LISTS.
My grandma made this every sunday
when i tell the local sandhich shop to make the sandwich a bit crazy
The schlexual tension is palpable
Yeah I would eat that, yea no me and my gramgram made that every sunday when I visited
i was having a great time watching this. then wilbur showed up.
Me and my Gram-Gram used to make this every Sunday before "Schlandwich" brutally murdered her back in '99.
When Schlett went to open up the beer and was struggling with it, I swear to God, I thought that he was going to just break it open on the counter and drink out of it like that
I'M FROM THE FUTURE, JUMPSCARE AT 15:00 - 15:13. YOUR WELCOME IN ADVANCE 😸👍
Endless bacon. Not games, though.
mmmmmmmm
Just the way jschlatt was about to fall 😂😂😂
its terrifying to see a fictional sandwich become a reality
all iu have to say ranboo what the fuck and emma great choice
Wanted to watch this again in 2025 to remember the podcast by
kinda crazy how only 1 person has been cancelled from this list
recreate it NOW!!!
"Jhuckle Schlandwich" was fucken dying
I miss Charlie
The chuckle sandwich should have weed in it
cant believe he got facetimed by the one and only nibbler soot
20:21 A plane has hit the first tower
Tucker carried the cooking
I'd eat that
Crazy that the only two I knew previously were the first ones said
20:20 schlorgasm
Woah I forgot the brighton biter makes a jumpscare in this vid
“Here’s to a hundred more” 😢
Does anyone know the music they're using at 5:05?
looks tasty tbh ngl id eat that
Yea no, me and my gram gram eat that every Sunday.
wilbur jumpscare
hi
The bacon cooking tells me neither of them have ever cooked a full meal in their lives
Too a hundred more? Huh interesting...
15:08 the bite of ‘24 appearance
Me and my grandpa make this every sunday
wilbur jumpscare
5:07
peter griffin with jshlatt
this the kinda shit Mordecai and Rigby would risk their lives for 💀
4:07 what happened to Schlatt here??
dude this is what the rest of the world thinks Americans do. chad would be sad to see you fail so long at opening a beer
I love this video its amazing
I came back to rewatch this masterpiece and had a heart attack at the jumpscare that is 15:10 i literally shriveled away from my phone.
This is just Ted being a divorced Dad and going through the pantry to try and find something to make his kids for lunch.
15:12 Ruh roh.
me and my gram gram make this every sunday
Me and my gran gran make that every Sunday
HOW WAS THIS A YEAR AGO WHAT IS HAPPENING
I used to make that every Sunday at my grandma's it's not that bad!
wow, the audio is borderline unlistenable. ARENT YOU GUYS SUPPOSED TO BE PROFESSIONALS 🤬🤬🤬🤬😤😤😤
I would eat that                (I don't think I can digest the gun, but I'll try)
9:54 Is that ape escape 3 music or something else
tucker always looks so happy to be there
yall is schlatt’s knee okay??😭 he keeps falling over
He was definitely going for a second bite 😂😂
That's a really nice car.....
13:39 its just a skidmark dude XD
I noticed that ted and schound dog didnt get any gun in their bites
wilbur scared me
I think Wilbur would like a bite
Did anyone notice Trevor (Cow Chop/OffCANNY) is the camera man??
what the actual heck you guys are funni
I like how Eddy Burback seems like one of the most normal dudes but he has the most unhinged addition of shaved thick water + a gun
grass not cut at sunrise, invalid sandwich
"Schlatt struggles with everyday kitchen gadgets" is a series I didn't realise I needed until this moment
That sandwich saddens me
eddys gun is my fav part tbh i also enjoy the fact that shlat just has a gun on hand
1:14 the further down the stars, the worse.  5- I enjoyed my stay and also realized that perfection does not exist.  4- Multiple issues that need improvement   3- Major issues. I hereby pronounce it uninhabitable. Shut down with haste.  2- I will glowingly recommend this place to my worst enemy.  1- Call the authorities.
Sand is criminal
6:43 the way he says it🤣🤣 “hold on, Hold On, HOLD ON, HER SISTER WAS A WITCH!!” Then schlatt’s blank stare🤣🤣
Me and my gram gram make that every Sunday! Such a crazy world!
Foolproof bacon: Lay out bacon on a sheet tray (and for fuck's sake put something on the sheet tray so the fats don't brown onto the surface and stick in an impossible mess on the tray) Put in cold oven Set timer for 20 mins Set oven to 400 degrees. Watch it at the end of the timer to get it to preferred doneness (different thicknesses and all that) Remove from oven and drain pieces
watching this 10 months later is funny cause i freaked out when they called Wilbur, i was worried he'd bite him
There's only like five ingredients ruining the sandwich
5:07 that did not age well 💀
Rainforest Cafe W
17:50 the way Ted called Tucker cherub lol
17:24 / 22:17 ur supposed to use the key that comes on the top of the tin and then twist the tab on the side with the key
the fact that danny requested grass cut with a scythe is the most danny thing to put in the chuckle sandwich
tucker was outside digging a hole in the front lawn. you know if you know
Tucker was definitely planning on going for another bite.
The ingredients where i draw the line: cheese whiz, corned beef, i respect danny and his addition but i think id avoid eating grass, ice probably, sand,  and probably slimecicle.  I think thats probably the typical no-gos, yeah?
I got scared when I saw Wilbur 😧
the rainforest cafe haunts us
Wilbur Jumpscare
I love Schlatt speaking good Spanish (Que es esto guapito? (`what is this, handsome?)), so cute! 6:36
I’m surprised that they didn’t add bacon.
Me and gram gram make this every Sunday ❤
the sandwich made me chuckle....jobs a goodun
this is straight up diarrhea and death
yeah me and my gram gram would eat that every sunday
Large men
6:25
Is no one gonna talk about 0:57 😭
6:45 i quote this all the time..  *”YOUR SISTER WAS A WITCH!”*
erm actually, unlike most solids, the way that water forms into ice actually makes the ice LESS DENSE than the water, thats why it floats! So ice is not like thick water
1:28 the 1 star rating said call the authorities  💀
4:49 pure comedy
This is the Human Cake all over again
6:36 "¿¡¿QUE ES ESTO PAPITO!?!??"
15:09 jesus christ what a jumpscare
15:00 Northern Nibbledr jumpscare
love when schlatt gets to a point of being drunk where he starts throwing tide pods at people
love how quackity's looked the worst but tasted the best
underrated channel
Bro when schlatts knee went out I fkn died bc that’s something I experience daily in the SAME KNEE 😂 I had surgery on it like 4 years ago and I don’t think it’s ever been the same 🥲
ted looks like a father and schlatt looks like the homeless guy that'd steal ted's shoes
Rest in sandwiches, Charlie would of loved this 💔💔
11:03 teasing the chicken *pop*
15:08 AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
I world definitely eat that. My grandma and me would chow down and eat that every Sunday
I SAW A SEA HAWKS CUP RAHHHHHH
15:03 fucking jumpscare
wheres the action on a man cutting grass with a scythe in a field during sunrise?
extra crunchy with schlatt's big black gun in the sandwich
5:06 that sounded actually painful
The way Tucker just casually says that the grease  caught fire is hilarious
you can tell they have never cooked before 🤣
wait who’s filming
Tucker with the aura
Crazy to see Wilbur
as a jimmy johns employee, the way you cut the bread had me dying imagining if i cut bread like that at work lmfao (also im only at the beginning but for all of the ingredients there’s no way this thing is closing😰)
dannys notion of grass cutting scythe is actually one of the funniest bits on the internet i think
i love how every new comment is just “wilbur jumpscare”
Will being in this did not age well...
turns out the chuckle sandwich is not chuckle worthy
i wish schlatt would shut up, this isnt about him honestly.
Would you guys have caseoh on the pod?
NOOOOOOOOO THEY WASTED SO MUCH FOOD DROPPING THAT SAND IN THERE NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
looks like something mordecai and rigby would die for lmfao
wilbur really just wanted a bite of the sandwich
The mentions of wilb*r are from 15:03 to 15:12.
Ted and schlatt have always been my favorite YouTuber you guys are awesome
This sandwich made my father chuckle until he died
Watching this now....the wilbur face time was a little bit of a jumpscare.
Ah.. if only schlaft can tease me 😔
Ted: HER SISTER WAS A WITVH Schlatt:😶
These three people are just large, immature, children.
0:13 he had no bullets
Tucker and Trevor added so much to this video, I love my T-boys
11:24 que schlaart being so wanted he can open a bottle
5:10 urmmm guys? Is schlatt a little wasted?
danny gonzales being mentioned in shredded grass is truel funny ( i love watching danny gonzales i didint know he was gonna be in here!)
My and my gram gram make that every sunday when i visit, the sandwich is not thay bad
it would've been so funny if schlatt pointed the gun at tucker and tucker did some john wick shit and took it from him
id eat it  ts look mad good
yall in Seattle?
There is a very strong ‘ sims stuck in the kitchen ‘ vibe through out the entire video
0:12 WHY IS NO ONE QUESTIONING SCHLATT??? LIKE SURE, THATS JUST SCHLATT, BUT STILL
Was Schlatt drunk?! He was definitely drunk😂
Wilbur soot jump scare.
Yeah I’d eat that
Wilber was cancelled! 🌚🌚🌚
I have never seen packaged barbacoa, nonetheless microwaveable... You guys are brave
I was with the sandwich until the Cheez Whiz. Urk.
Freshly cooked barbacoa is good. Prepackaged is ew
10:19 telling qac to come home and eat dinner with family is a flash form The past.🤯
I miss unus annus
19:40 Now that’s what I call …. Chekov’s Gun.
Yeah id eat that me and my gram gram eat that alllll the time
Im getting flashbacks of Trevor filming cowchop videos in their house kitchen while watching him in this.
Does anyone remember Cooking With Cream - this is that
I really do not appreciate the camera man gagging every 5 minutes 😂
Wilbur jumpscare 15:08
Mordecai and Rigby would blow up 3 timelines for this sandwich.
Yeah i would eat that
FUCK YOU TUCKER HATERS.
15:02 There's the guy that should've eaten the sandwich, I hear he's got quite the jaw on him
When they started putting that sandwich together I started getting Filthy Frank Max Mofo and iDupes doing hair cake vibes, felt good beautiful work boys.
Dear Snat and Todd, Thank you for inspiring me to make my own sandwich. It was not good Fuck you
what do you have against corned beef??
Ted and jschlatt have to go every McDonald's
Me and my gram gram eat this every sunday
These are very two large men I’m realizing
tucker is just so happy to be there it’s so cutw
I have never in my life seen someone make bacon look so gray
I don't know if it's because I'm hungry, but I'd unironically eat this entire thing
12:46 LMFAO not the fucking electric stove 😭 bruh
Y’all should redo this at 150 where you each have to pick 25 ingredients (like take turns draft?) and execute a plan to combine them into an edible sandwich
the way they cooked the barbacoa really bugged me lmao
hold the fuck up is trevor from cowchop their cameraman? i know that voice
Is the camera man Trevor from the old cow chop vids?
me seeing the wilbur call now
tucker’s “not that bad” compared to schlatt’s “i’m gonna vomit” and rinsing his mouth in the sink is so funny to me
Can’t believe they cut that gun diagonally! And ate it afterwards! That’s crazy.
Modern day Human Cake
Somebody's gonna ask for this as their last meal and they're gonna have to make it.
the barbacoa slander is actually wild tbh
The man in the blue shirt is too right "that was the tipping point" me too brother!
Nah, I'd consume feverishly.
airsoft pistol
um autist here tucker was right about the tree it is elm
It looks like something Shaggy and Scooby Doo would eat
I am feeling Wilbur will have a bite out of this chuckle sandwich
RIGHT. AND WHAT WAS HER SISTER? A PRINCESS
I bet Wilbur would love to get a big BITE out of that sandwich!
ngl i want to eat that
I knew as soon as I saw Tucker's face that he was going to say the sandwich wasn’t bad
Schlatt in that hoodie looks like one of the goombas from the 90's mario movie
Wilbur would bite into that
I feel like I'm watching myself cook
Did the wash the grass? And is it weird if they didn’t?
fig jam would go hard on this
wild to me that schlatt complained more about the tomatoes or pickles than some of the condiments or the grass lmao
what the fuck is jschlatt. what is he
11:22   as a german that made me irrationally angry.
I love this part ted! 12:38 😄🫶🏻
6:43 schlatt looks so distraught
If it didnt have a gun, sand and grass  and those thic slices of tomato I would have eaten that
Schlatt looks like the type of man to willingly drink a twisted tea & drive an off brand tesla lookin thing
okay well corned beef is also like a sliced deli meat and not the breakfast kind of corned beef that's used in camping and DOES need to be cooked. like corned beef cooked over a campfire is literally so good, clearly I'm watching a bunch of city slickers...
THE WICKED WITCH OF THE EAST BRO
When schlatt threw the tide pod at the camera man, (5:06) it sounded like the camera man just threw up due to the sheer strength and velocity behind that tide pod
The dramatic shot of the bacon burning on the stove while Ted and Tucker fight in the background.... Poetic cinema
I just got an Arby’s ad
anyone else see the sandwich from amazing world of gumball?
15:14 here so you can skip Wilbur 😁
The fucking banquet barbacoa????? And then you MICROWAVED IT???????
“Is that self driving” “no” had me laughing so hard
9:50 I have that same microwave that thing cooks shit up real good
me and my gram gram eat that every sunday
I can smell this video
would...
This is the kinda shit shiny hunters make
this turned me from a tucker hater to a tucker stan in 0.001 seconds
9:00 agresiv
8:49 love that pic
I know I'm in the minority here but when did 3 stars become not the fucking average? A 3star hotel is average. A 3 star restaurant is average. Why do all these fucking apps think I'm going to give their shitty AirBNB with 500 rules 5 stars, if it's exactly what you say it is, it's 3 stars AKA: MEETS EXPECTATIONS. 5 is GREATLY EXCEEDS EXPECTATIONS. 50% of my uber/lyft rides are 3 stars, some are 4, I've given two 5 star uber rides and they DESERVED IT. Same with AirBNB shit, 1 stars are FAR more likely than 5 stars.
why the did yall get a brioche bread
How do fuck bacon up so hard
Y'know I bet Trevor would make a wonderful vampire thrall for a man like Ted, simply wonderful.
Two schizophrenic men build a sandwich with each ingredient being chosen by their caretakers and imaginary friends they met in the mental hospital.
My biggest question during this whole video is how the hell do American homes not have overhead fans for every cooking surface?? I've seen this multiple times now, and it makes me incredibly concerned for their well-being.  Edit: Concerned for their mental well-being, that is
TREVORRRRRR
Now kiss!
if you didnt add the sand and grass id try it. idk if id like it but id sure as hell TRY it
unironically this is something I'd make and try. I made a "lasagna" with gummy bears instead of hamburger meat, boiled tortilla shells instead of noodles, shredded hash browns instead of cheese, and smuckers caramel sauce instead of a normal sauce. video evidence on my channel... not a promo
Sluckle Chandwich
Schlag with the squidward bite
tucker looks like a non-alcoholic mason
Bro schlatts auauaauauauaggghh was so unnecessary 💀
yeah no me and my gram gram made that at like every sunday when i visited!!
Tucker walking in is like seeing Jesus himself coming to aid your
wheres anthony i mean charlie
I'll never not laugh at Tucker reaching through Ted to grab Schlatt @ 13:02
other then the gun i would acc devour that
They did QTCinderella dirty ☹️
How are they going to do Danny Gonzalez?
them putting the gun on there made me cringe the hardest
im going to have nightmares about this sandwich
6:25 the spanish is sending 😭
Me and my gram gram eat this every sunday
Me and my Gram Gram make that every Sunday bro
for YEARS that is not what I thought Ted meant by the butt pieces of bread
Schlatt should not be driving considering what happened in 99’
love how "schlatt" got the cheapest piece of shit barbacoa known to man to put it into the sandwhich
schatt drives a damn s-class? why am i surprised?
tucker deserves an ingredient on the sandwich. and borif
I died at 14:06 when he said "I fucking hate pickles don't put another one" and then it cut to another pickle on the sandwich.
I feel like Boruff definitely meant the deli corned beef you get on a Reuben and not the shitty canned corned beef you brown for hash
I’m gonna make this sandwich and I’m gonna eat the whole thing. If I die I die.
22 minutes to put together a sandwich? damn, you guys are worse than my wife!
HER SISTER WAS A WITCH!!!
im crying myself to sleep
I really hope that Ted was able to buy the anaheim rainforest cafe cup from the owners!
when Tucker walked in, i couldn't even edge. i splooged immediately. clean up on isle my pants
Schlatt is probably a whole lot of fun to hang out with.. Until he is not. Then he is the most insufferable person to hang out with.
damn I smelled that shit from another dimention
Schlatt looks like 2 children in a trenchcoat why are his shoulders comically broad at the beginning
bruh why didnt anyone say baby food
11:05
10:48 helpp
12:55
yeah i would eat that, my gram gram used to make it every sunday when i visited her
me and schlatt are the same
Binging with Babish couldn't dare top this
*points* "You're through"
I knew I heard the beautiful voice of Trevor love to see him Back at it filming some caos again
what are the odds that Ted finds a Rainforest Cafe cup
cool. now collab with joshua weissman and have him make an edible chef inspired gourmet version of this sandwich
You should have had Charlie in the beginning and then he just disappears
So no joe bart salt
i love randomly seeing wilbur appear in different places around youtube
200th episode is they have to eat an entire chuckle sandwhich each.
I need a recipe.
I love watching Tucker make videos with his 2 large and very special little boys
is this binging with babish?
i think the toby fox battle music really adds to this
Crazy how they cut the gun in half!
In a world without Unus Annus, videos like these are what we need 😭😭
does anyone else see that weird black line?
If this guys bought a ticket for me I would give them a cooking lesson cuz this is actually giving me the chills.
It looks inedible 😂
CHUCKLE SANDWICH (Legendary Cursed Item) Deals 1d100 damage to whoever consumes it Roll 2d100 to determine a random effect. Most common is uncontrollable laughter, but others include: Internal Gunshot Wound (1d6 ranged) Transforming into a Gelatinous Cube (Until long rest) Lungs magically filled with sand (Lasts until short rest) Hypothermia (2d4 frost damage) Spontaneous Combustion (Instant Kill)
That looked edible, and possibly even a little bit tasty, until they started putting grass on it.
Bone apple teeth
They should do multiple generations of the chuckle sandwich
They need to release the recipe in an actually compressible form that's not just a chaotic video
Tucker is a cutie 🥰
this was distressing
the Kinjiro reference was one i was not expecting lol
they should do a collab with binging with babish to try make an edible version
scoobie and shagie
Mmmmm, Yummy.
I cannot believe they desecrated a loaf of challa like that, thats a bread that deserves respect
Yeah no id eat that. Yeah thats me and my gram gram would make that like every sunday
This is exactly what I’ve been waiting for
I fukin love tucker man
i think that ted is always high
19:13 I thought that joes was the wildest one, but then it just cuts to eddy Burback  with a gun at 19:45 😂😂😂
Before watching, hope they add the human skin!
Multiple issues that need improvement
l love how schaltt just cut the gun inhalf flawlessly using a knife
I love how for Danny’s they had to use a scythe
lmfaooo not Danny's scythe
As someone who”s only watched 3 episodes to completion, I’ll gladly take credit for my .0000000006% contribution to the show, which statistically is 0.  (Bonus points if you recognize that specific percentage from a certain comedian)
If someone doesnt play ”Green Goblin Mode” right now im gonna piss!!!
ted looks like a skinny peter griffin
I don’t think that sandwich is gonna allow for alotta chuckling…, but rather a lot more *CHOKELING.* wait that sounds like a chocolate treat… somehow.
schlatt the kind of guy to be more scared of a saw like 2 feet from him than a gun pointed directly at his head
Trevor bwing here really caught me off guard, i didnt know they were friends and got some wild cowchop vibes
Schlatt in the new schcedes
Every 100 episodes this should be done, and it just gets overwhelmingly big and whenever you want to quit the podcast just say you fear the chuckle sandwich
Bro really said "Fuck you" *unbigs your mac*
I swear I was watching a old filthy frank vid this is chuckle sandwich?
Type of shit scooby and shaggy would eat.
Schlatt cut through the gun?
Cant wait to see how they incorporate the vibe of scything grass early in the morning
this is like watching any of the haircake videos without feeling like im gonna throwup its so good
The way they all yelled when Wilbur called 😂 But honestly like so happy for Chuckle Sandwich !! ❤ 💯
12:50 you dont need fire to start a grease fire i had an electric stove at my dad and when i was making something it boiled over the top and landed on the stove i quickly turned the heat off but just after that a fire started
12:53 grease can catch fire on electric stoves, some hot oil sloshed out of a pan i was using onto the heating element and there was a small fire
Where’s markiplier
This should be one of those eating challenges at a restaurant
why is schlatt built like gru with his super baggy sweatshirt
I don't remember subscribing to this channel. I just saw one video and blacked out half way through it. I woke up days later in the corner of an empty parking garage in a cold sweat, my left kidney missing, and I was watching this video with somehow having subscribed. A very good looking sandwich.
Spam is so good idk what they are complaining about honestly.
You are never given a wish without also being given the power to make it come true. You may have to work for it, however.
The elephant didn't want to talk about the person in the room.
Being in humaneness is good. If we select other goodness and thus are far apart from humaneness, how can we be the wise?
We can do no great things, only small things with great love.
To be fully alive, fully human, and completely awake is to be continually thrown out of the nest.
Success is determined by those whom prove the impossible, possible.

He who knows others is wise. He who knows himself is enlightened.
He knew it was going to be a bad day when he saw mountain lions roaming the streets.
Yo was that Trevor? Did I hear Trevor? Trevor? TREVORRRRRR  Edtit: IT IS TREVOR OMG TREVOR HI!!!
I mean, it was fine until they started adding actual grass, sand and ice cubes, also forgot the middle big mac bun
@binging with Babish your move
children's in Africa going to lose their fyxking mind over this. God save us from these Americans
Flap, Nipple, and Tim, congratulations on creating world hunger!
I feel like I’m watching that episode of adventure time were Jake makes the perfect sandwich
Wow, the actor they got to cover for schlagg really did a good job of upholding his character. Its almost like hes still with us.   R.I.P. Big Guy
Spirit of gram gram in the background at 9:16 🧐
Its weird seeing Jshlatt in a kitchen
1:14 Are we just gonna ignore how the two star rating is "I will glowingly recommend this to my worst enemy" and the one star summary is "call the authorities."
WHAT ABOMINATION OF BARBACOA DID THEY BUY????
Yeah I'd eat that.
ted is a young phil from modern family
Tucc, Toob and “Shloop” really knocked it outta the park with this one.
would.
schled and tat
Can’t believe they desecrated Charlie’s remains on camera.
the first rule of gun safety is to have fun
I recommend saying this video is out on ur pod because it didn’t get recommended to me since I only listen on Spotify🎉
My god they’ve actually done it… the absolute mad lads!
Yeah, me and my gram-gram make that every Sunday, I'd eat that.
cute !!!
I had multiple problems with this video and therefore I give it 4 stars and one pity like
that barbacoa is an affront to god what did you buy
This reminds me of the blender challenge from 2012
Get binging with babish on this.
RARAAAAA ARAAAAA ARAAAA ARAAAAAA
He was the type of guy who liked Christmas lights on his house in the middle of July.
Make the best use of what is in your power, and take the rest as it happens.
I’m noticing a lot of sexual tension between tucker and
One star. Call the authorities.
at the 200th episode they need to make this again but add the stuff from first one and from the new ones.
He fumbled in the darkness looking for the light switch, but when he finally found it there was someone already there.
Believe deep down in your heart that you're destined to do great things.
shoutout to trevor for dealing with crazy mfs
tucker looks exactly like i thought he would. like a king
Bacon bits isnt bacon bro 😭😭
The Trevor from cow chop cameo was a special little treat of its own
smh no scott the woz
if you want a oldschool liver and heart recipe. look up 'balkenbrei' and translate to english
20.55 best frame in existence
bro thats like 4000 calories
Can’t wait for the sandwich in episode 200
yeah i would eat that
None of them knew how to open the corned beef…
Beautiful car splatt
schlatt trying to eat the sandwhich reminds me of that episode of spongebob where squidward eats a crabby patty
Okay but I'd actually eat that
Jandwich Schlatt lmao
But what does this have to do with kanye?
7777
These idiots never seen a precooked ham steak before
That's an airsoft gun☝🤓
Canonically the best sandwich
this channel who doesn't even know I exists takes batter care of my mental health then my own parents
CHUCKLURS?
Tucker was totally gonna go for that second bite till Ted called him out on it
This was such a fun video I love the goofy irl stuff. It made me chuckle, even!
honestly this makes me wish someone like binging with babish makes a more... edible version
How much is the car?
I love that Ted knows so much Rainforest Cafe lore that whenever he saw the downtown Disney cup he decided it was important enough to mention it is a close location LOL
It was a mistake eating while watching this
I would eat that. ME and my grandma make that every Sunday.
I wanna see Binging With Babish make this sandwich but actually good somehow
Should’ve mixed all the sauces/liquid and spread them evenly.
Wheres my schlanket schlatt
most normal white people food gun and all
I like the concern about the ham steak being edible, considering the additions of grass and sand. Oh and a gun of course
Jesus loves you
Chuckle pasta next
Let's go cameraman Trevor!
reminds me of hair cake saga
Chuckla fellow, and a chuckler
⭐⭐⭐⭐ This video has multiple issues that need improvement.
They're going to need to replace that microwave 9:45  That smell is never leaving
11:33 Ted watches his son struggle his first beer
Man no slimgimikilmecicleiso. :(
im ngl if you didnt put grass or sand or a gun in it i would eat it, it looks good
My friend thought the chuckle sandwich was taking two pieces of bread, laughing in between them, and putting them together.
This so trend going too far man Rip Jschlatt you will be missed😢☹️🪦🪦
At this point it feels like Wilbur will show up in anyone‘s videos but his own
paused at 13:08. pure nightmare fuel
Everybody's got a Tucker these days
Can we talk about how this was a half decnt sandwich before they threw fucking sand and grass on it 😂😭
i have a crush on all these large men wtf stop being funny
tucker will always be my favorite member
Is that my guy, Trevor, tasked with camera duty? 😮
You can tell it’s an elm because of the way it is. That’s pretty neat.
Who knew the only Wilbur soot content we got in the last month is on Chuckle Sandwich🥲
I used to make and eat this with my grandma. R.I.P Grandma
Does schlatt really fucking cruise around texas in a black mercedes S class?
Only 4 mins into the vid and Schlub's already drunk af
Tucker taking every second to threaten schlatt is exactly the kind of hope the victims need. He's not invincible.
not toasted? for shame
only took then one minute to break 2 gun rules at once
So the chuckle sandwich was the friends we made along the way?
honestly, getting a sandwich with the butt pieces of bread onto the logo has been long overdue
Chucklesandwich lost its chuckle when slime left
I would be a good creamy spread of Brie.   Because I get everywhere.   Interpret that how you will.
the fact is that if we forgo the corn beef, waht ever quackity put in sand and grass, and ofc the gun that seemed like a pretty banger thing to eat
I can’t believe Ted and Schlatt ate out all of their guests of the podcast! Happy 100!
Barbacoa is really good! Maybe the microwave version is shitty cause, y’know, it’s microwave food, but actual barbacoa is so yummy!
Describing Schlatt as the silent problem kid is spot on actually
me, a home cook, dying on the inside watching them not stir fry the corned hash... and everything lmao
Glad you’re still going
How could you do this and not being Charlie back this is bullshit. You’ve performed a Christmas miracle before to raise him from the dead.
the fucking rage seething through my Mexican body as schlart reacts like a four year old to barbacoa
Given Trevor filming I get such old cow chop vibes from this video and I have a weird feeling of nostalgia from this and house era cow chop
I'm late. Danny's was incorrect because Danny stated very clearly that the notion occured durring sunrise. Do the video again.
That sandwich could kill an entire town full of medieval people just by the sight of it
They didnt cut the grass at sunrise.
3:42 KIA SOUL CAMEO
lmao i didnt know Tucker was the shortest
Major issues, I hereby proclaim it unwatchable. shut down with haste
In terms of the sANdWicH, would you rate it, or hate it?
"So many flavors that hit you all at once... and it's mostly corn beef"
I got an ad for a casino and an ad for a Mercedes van. I guess ill try get one
You forgot Markiplier's request for bleach and ammonia, it's understandable though given the circumstances of that episode
cant believe it's been a hundred yrs 🥰🥰
DID THEY LEAVE THE FUCKING BONE IN THE HAM?????????????????
the 'her sister was a witch' lit up a part of my past ngl
Schlatt when you can't open the beer I think it's a sign you've had enough
the faint deltarune music threw me off why is it so quiet it makes me feel like im hearing things
Why was the bacon grey tho 😭😭
HELLO Ted and Schlatt! YOU'RE AMAZING, your culinary skills always harbour all the best feelings of LOVE and JOY to all that watch your content! I would PERSONALLY like to congratulate you on your STUNNING performance, and your ability to ALWAYS make people laugh! Have a JOY filled HOLIDAY!
I once had a thought of making a sandwich with every ingredients of every 10 episodes of chuckle sandwich and I made them, I only never uploaded them anywhere cuz I don't have anything to record with, the original plan was a YouTube channel with me making the sandwiches and saying which episodes had the best combination of flavors, I might still make it someday but still, I'm glad the guys made something I dreamed of doing as a tribute to them ^^
Why is it called garlic Aioli?? There's already garlic in regular Aioli.
5:07 is nobody gonna mention that my man just threw up upon impact.
very proud to know i have the same microwave as chuckle sandwhich
Schlatt being an enjoyer of the Huberman Lab Podcast simultaneously fits his character specimen so well, yet came out of nowhere… 10/10
ted and schlatt saying “pendenjo” really made my day
someone needs to be the airbnb plastic cutting board under the sando now
4 seconds in and schlatts playing with a gun. i love it
Schlatt simping for Quackity? /j
tbh this camera man is not it. </3
Me and my gram gram make this every Sunday morning.
FINALLY THE CHUCKLE SANDWICH IS HERE
Couldnt even edge to this!
why does schlatts head look so small compared to his body
5:04 LMAOOO
Didnt expected Toad Kaczynski and Schladolf Schattler to make a sandwich that could kill a whole town of Victorian Children
That's a really funny sandwich
mb guys thought this was gonna be a porno.
i’m sad charlie isn’t here for the 100 episode
her sister was a witch made me cry
scatschlat with the s class 8D
Never have I been more repulsed by a sandwich before
The mentions of Quackity Barbacoa made me very happy
schlatt was the ONLY one of you that took an acceptable bite. he put his whole heart and soul into that bite.
i’m so happy they included the notion of cutting grass with a scythe. bummed they couldn’t do it in the morning tho
Love this so much!!💜💜
Binging with Babish colab when?
go give it to a homeless man
The way Schluntlet dropped that gun on the sandwich really reminded me of how he disposed of the evidence back in 1999.
Tucker: "this is a birch tree, you can tell by the way that it is." 1:29
The absolute and complete lack of any food based knowledge is astounding. Y'all need a lady there to help.
whyd they pick the absolute worst chips for will neff
that moment when the sandwich started chuckling was my favorite part
bumbaclat
Welcome to the Huberman lab podcast... 😂😂😂
Someone get Babish on the horn!!
bro i got the same fuckin microwave holy shit
Que es esto quackito???
ur supposed to cut challah with a special bread knife, otherwise you pull it with your hands
Multiple issues that need improvement.
its bulking szn and i would fucking destroy that sandwich
Chuckle Sandwich!!!
Watching the creation of the chuckle sandwich while eating a sandwich
We love trevor in the household
6:49 the snicker from the fucking camera man
oh yeah m and my grandad used to make that sandwich before he died from, the incident.
I would eat that 😋
5:05 why did it sound so juicy ?!
schlatt doing the squidward bite
bro got a m1911   i think????
Tucker making the Marine Corps proud by almost going in for seconds on a sandwich that includes actual sand, freshly cut grass, suspicious hams and jelly.
Yo shout out to Trevor, love that iconic camera work 😊
Where’s joe bartolozzies little bit of sand
You gotta update the logo now
The Holy Trinity. That's all I have to say :)
awww you guys made that recipe? me and my gramgram would make that every sunday...i miss her
Tucker grabbing schlats collar as he and Ted wrestle is comedy incarnate
Anyone else get a tide pod ad moments before schlatt threw one at ted?
I love how jschlatt is the alcoholic and he was struggling to open the coronas
it took 100 numbers of some scale of time to make a fucking sandwich
The rainforest Cafe souvenir cup took me out
bro I make that every day
dude you just invented macless big mac
I need to see a "Babish version" of this
So… the meat.
Schlatt is so drunk I'm crying
I’d be a comically large cartoon chunk of ham with a bone sticking out of it
that might be worse than the meat mountain....
Dodnt watch yet, Im expecting hair cake
Yo is Trevor from cow chop the camera guy 8:05
Tucam tucker cam pov view camera 😂👍
Me and my Gram Gram use to make this every Sunday! Thanks for bringing it back guys I miss those days, good ol Gram Gram.
I don’t think there’s a worse feeling than spending a lot of time cooking something and it ends up tasting bad. Well other than watching the second tower fall
omg schlatt also has an unhealthy love for mayo he's just like me fr
Been here for like 80 eps and holy- time flies.. AND I KEEP FORGETING SHLATT HATES TOMATOS? WHAT THE SHIT IT LOOKS HEAVENLY (the tomato.. not the chuckle sandwich)
Charlie without glasses hit different
Me and my gram gram eat that every sunday
TREVOR FROM COWCHOP OH MY GOD
It’s not chuckle sandwich without Charlie
This reminds me of the time when filthy frank made the human cake
I'm glad tucker has slowly become a more prominent member of the podcast. It's great to see.
I loved the part where shart and red said "its chucklin' time!" And starting chucklin' all over the place
this is definitely an american podcast
Needs more shots of tucker, bad video
Schlatt needs to own a Five Seven
Lost it when Schlatt started using the scythe to open the meat
forgot tucker was a marine until bro immediately switched into schlatt 1:00
Yeah I would eat that
Between the cost of the sandwich ingredients, the air bnb cleaning free, and the future therapy visits for tucker with all of schlatts bullying, the total of the experience will only be: $9,864.83 (:
Now ask for favorite pizza topping and do this
AND WHAT WAS HER SISTER?! A PRINCESS!!! the wicked witch of the EAST BRO
As a SM fan, seeing Matt and Ryan's faces in a tiny ass png in a chuckle sandwhich video gave me too much dopamine, I miss those boys
This isn’t even nearly as bad as any british sandwich
Schlatt cut through a gun
Quackity meat
Tucker is jacked
did schlatt break 5'7 in the whole video?
change the corned beef for short ribs and take out the dirt and grass, SALT THE TOMATOES, and i would  go for seconds propably. maybe thirds
i thoroughly enjoyed this video i just wish {REDACTED} was here to see it i give it a call the authorities out of five
watching these "people" trying to cook, makes me realize what kind of creatures they are
10:30 … alright we get it, you’re gay, no need to spread your propaganda
yea i would eat that, me and my gram gram eat that like every sunday.
sdp better
The power that surged through the room when Tucker walked in was actually unbelievable. Bro sent chills down the shaft of my cock
“HER SISTER WAS A WITCH”🤣
Every 100 episodes you recreate the Chuckle Sandwich with more and more ingredients each time, until by the time the podcast ends the sandwich is the size of a fucking New York apartment
Glad to see Trevor hasnt been eaten by the goblins he keeps in the basement yet.
This feels like watching two middle school boys making a hazardly food combo with the school chicken sandwich and different juices
How did they forget to drench the whole thing in milk like Markiplier requested in his episode?
Schlaft looks like he shouldn't be that tall, he looks like he got leg extensions just so he wouldn't look small when standing next to Ted.
As a part of the chuckle sandwich I'm excited to make it and try it myself
5:08 what was that sound
Audio listener btw what a short episode of the pod not sure what happened hope everything is ok guys 😢
Loved it when Ted and Schlatt said "It's time to chuckle!" and then ate the last bite.
How to basic back at it again
This is what it's all about
The fact that both were drunk made this video 100x better
When I first started watching I thought I would be able to follow along and make a nice sandwich one day.. I am so glad I didn't attempt to make what schled and tatt did
What kind of an stupid idiot do you have to be where you can't open a can of corned beef with the key?
this is favorite puppy
when ted and tucker had that fight i laughed so hard my stomach hurt. genuinely one of the funniest moments these guys have ever had
Ballad and Ded finally made the actual grunkle bandwidth
So nostalgic. Me and me gran gran used to eat that. REAL
I'm disappointed that not a single guest picked anything spicy.
Merc 🤢
0:57 classy
can we appreciate the trigger control on tuckers part for the starting bit. thats my vet o7
if you asked me to guess who would make a guest appereance i would have guessed everyone except wilbur fucking soot
I’d feed it to some raccoons 🦝
I can’t believe Tab and Shift finally hit 100 episodes
I was here from the beginning and I regret every step of the journey
I almost puked jesus christ, happy 100!
why dose every youtuber have a tucker
Tucker, Schlatt and Ted look so cute together! I'd love to see more throuple content
Me and my gram gram make that every Sunday when I visit
Ted...Tell me you stole that Disney Rainforest Cafe glass
0/10 no slime
As a non audio listener, tucker looks so different from the side
For some reason I could smell the new car smell when they got in the car. Hope I'm not the only one!
This is why men scare me
The first guest's choice never made it. That weed brownie...
I like how Schlatt just glossed over the one star rating being "call the authorities" before he was brutally murdered by Ted Nivison.
Give the rest to a homeless person
the sandwich was edible before the grass
Funny brothers mentioned!
For 200 episodes they have to make the sandwich and eat every last sand particle
Schlatt needs to start throwing tide pods at every guest they invite
tucker is so hot   youtube be making funky sounds i like
YES!!!
I think it might need one more stick of butter.
Tatt and Schled
11:56  he died a very gay man. Rip.
this is glorious and amazing and better than i ever thought possible
me and my gram gram make that every Sunday
”Let me pop the AUTOMATIC trunk” 😒bruh
not even shaggy and scooby could concoct this monstrosity
my favorite part was when shag saaid "its chucklin sammy time" and thern jed nivi said "i think this calls for a chuckle... sandwhich"
It was actually looking quite good until the grass and then it all went down
God Ted is annoying!
“Quackity’s been on my mind for years, dude. He’s never left.” Same Shatt, same  Edit: “Stop adding so much Quackity.” “I love him.”
This poor poor poor fucking airbnb. That microwave is never gonna recover
It makes me so happy seeing Trevor in content again!
Now have binging with babish on and have him make it better
LET TUCKER TALK ABOUT HIS TREES MY GOD THE MAN DESERVES IT
A virtue (Latin: virtus) is a trait of excellence, including traits that may be moral, social, or intellectual. The cultivation and refinement of virtue is held to be the "good of humanity" and thus is valued as an end purpose of life or a foundational principle of being. In human practical ethics, a virtue is a disposition to choose actions that succeed in showing high moral standards: doing what is right and avoiding what is wrong in a given field of endeavour. When someone takes pleasure in doing what is right, even when it is difficult or initially unpleasant, they can establish virtue as a habit. Such a person is said to be virtuous through having cultivated such a disposition. The opposite of virtue is vice, and the vicious person takes pleasure in habitual wrong-doing to their detriment.  Other examples of this notion include the concept of merit in Asian traditions as well as De (Chinese 德). Buddhism's four brahmavihara (lit. 'Divine States') can be regarded as virtues in the European sense.
Thank God this is their last episode
I watched this in black in white… why did I think that was ok.
minus the jelly, that sandwich looks tolerable, if not a little tasty
The greatest thing is that the only time these two made something even remotely eatable was when they made icecream with alcohol
Really disappointed that Ted didn't cut the bread with the scyth
which one was penguinz0 again?
yeah, i'd eat that
I love how there is a firearm included in the first 10s of the video. what the fuck xD
What a neat idea for an episode! I would have loved to see Its_Jawsh here, but this is something that should really only be done by the hosts.
they just act like how real friends act which i find awesome
I love tucker all my homis love tucker
Not enuff mayo
I couldn’t even edge to this, I exploded immediately!!! Clean up on aisle MY PANTS 😂😂😂😂
4 stars, multiple issues needs improvement…  Got arrested for the *alleged* attempted vore-ing of roughly 40 mostly YouTubers and Streamers. ❤
Bro tucker had that fucking quick draw wtf
Danny Gonzalez’s ingredient - the notion of a guy cutting grass with a scythe - will probably always be my favorite part of the sandwich. It was so funny and out of nowhere when Danny chose it.
This is painful to watch when you know how to cook
Yeah, I feel like the Jevil theme would play if anyone tries to fight Tucker
i love that this is a spiritual successor to the 'making the ultimate x' videos
:)
Just like me and gram gram used to make 😢
The disrespect of giving the B. E. A. UTIFUL Cherub a single Mac, not even a Big one.
WE MAKING IT INTO THE SANDWICH WITH THIS ONE🔥🔥🔥🗣🗣🗣
Lmao i need to hear more of schlatt trying to speak spanish
I want to try this sandwich so bad actually
love seeing my baby boy trevor
This was both disgusting and beautiful. Congratulations on 100 episodes!
They forgot to add the milk that Markiplier added in the lost episode.
Now you have to do a collaboration with Binging with Babish now to make a "good version"
So proud of my sons. They finally learned how to make a real sandwich worthy of the family name. Congratulations tack and shled.
"DO YOU NOT KNOW WHERE YOURE HERE FOR???!" - Ted 2023
Having the oven in the middle of the room is a flex. 7:11
Don't shame a man enjoying his Chuckle Sandwich
They never added the weed brownie 😔
Me and my gram gram make that every Sunday
This was a great video to eat too
Love these guys  lol
i hoped shclatt would spread the mayo with the scythe lol
19:33 they fucking killed charlie again
This is the best episode of Epic Meal Time ever
Modern human cake
I can totally see 20:10 being in the intro from now on. Also congrats!
I would devour it like it's nobody's business honestly Makes sense tho because I was here from the day 1 lmao Happy 100 :)
honestly fried chx skin on a sandwhich sounds pretty awesome
wtf is up with the throwup sound bro
i finished the pod for the 2nd time so hapy 200th episode
I think I got food poisoning just from watching this. Love you guys <3
Schlobb whippin the s class
It's finally happened. They did it. The chuckle sandwich itself. We're now in the post-sandwich arc
yall need the new zealand corned beef
Whole thing looked good till the grass and ice and dirt. Also the tartar sauce. They should have cooked the corned beef
the only podcast I've consistently kept up with, thank you for such a good celebration video
i dont see any concepts of men cutting grass with a scythe on this sandwich. edit: i hadnt watched the video when i made the original comment above, and now i realise how wrong i was. the madmen have actually put a hint of a notion of a man cutting grass with a scythe. this is a small step for podcasters, but a giant leap for sandwich kind.
Every time I see Trevor in a video it brings me great joy.
tucker looks so happy to be there😭
heehee they included the supermega boys ryan mafunny and matt giggles
Great episode.  It does suck to see food waste when I can barely afford gtoceriss.. tmi
two vindictive little demons torturing me with their nonsense
SCHIBBLE🎉🎉🎉🎉
SCHIBBLE🎉🎉🎉🎉
SCHIBBLE🎉🎉🎉🎉
SCHIBBLE🎉🎉🎉🎉
SCHIBBLE🎉🎉🎉🎉
Thank you a million times over for this amazing podcast. It’s consistently been a favorite piece of YouTube content for me for nearly two years and I can’t wait to someday get added to the sandwich as a guest on this illustrious podcast
always chucklin
Schlatt is my favorite acholic
Wait rip lunch club
I was drunk when I stared watching now I,m just more drunkk
5:07 what the fuck is this sound?
I cant believe fuck and shred made the crunckle bandwidth
3 years later, content just kept getting better. love it
Won’t forgive him for what he did to my family back in ‘99.
A joy and privilege to be here in this part of history
I actually feel sick. Congrats!
Average new Yorker sandwich
Now put the Chuckle Sandwich in the ice-cream machine
I teared up when Schlibb chuckled and sandwiched all over the screen...
man you guys really have fallen off
Schlab beat the living fuck outta that potato chip bag... probably thought that it was a bag of children that he murdered in 1999
Chuckled that sandwich
6:47 HER SISTER WAS A WITCH CAUGHT ME SO OFF GUARD-
Cuts all the vegetables with a bread knife and then cuts the assembled sandwich with a chef's knife
wow i cant belive that ted and schlatt support isnotreal😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡
I genuinely love chuckle sandwich but every person in this video scares me so much
Man this looks so good i would devour that sandwich!
this is funnier knowing their were 4 people present not 3
There's a no smoking sign in the kitchen but no hutt over the stove buncha stupid fuckin' owners
the perfect video to watch being inside of a chimney. Chuckletastic
This whole video is just a fever dream version of fat tv's crazy joker sandwitch
Nothing seasons a sandwich better than pure gun metal I’ve always said this
this video has multiple issues that need to be resolved. 4 out of 5 stars.
This like new fortnite
No way  shart immediately pulls out a gun
HEB SWEEP
How the fuck did Jslaght almost fall while standing still  Also 5:06 did my guy fucking throw up when he got hit in the nuts cause holy shit
I cant believe its been so long, holy cow. Proud chuckler since day one.  That shit looks vile btw
I love Tucker!
Honestly, with everything on there, it doesnt *LOOK* horrible, but im sure it is.
12:07
You should always donate your leftover food… 22:03
Watching schlatt sit hunched over defeated after taking a bite of the sandwich was unironically my favourite part of this video
20:07 I mean, the sandwich looks okay… if you ignore like, 80% of the ingredients in it.
I was so ready to call them a coward for initially saying they didnt want to eat it but after seeing them add grass and sand i see why
Jschlatt has that aggressive homeless man energy. The perma antagonist.
One star: Call the authorities.   WHAT
oh shit new how to basic video!
did u buy the cup off them or did u steal it
Loved hearing Trevor behind the camera
What part on the sandwich is trevor?
I can't believe Bled shot SchuckyBucky in the first minute SMH shaking my head my head
this is such peak, "Last Day Of Vacation, Fuck it" energy.  Love it
the world revolving fits them ngl
Idk why I thought Schlatt was short 🤷🏻‍♂️
this is just a young sals big joes sloppy italian from gereleos
What brave young men willing to sacrifice their lives for the sake of our chuckles 🫡
this was everything i expected and so much more. cheers to 100 chuckles!
The wet scream at 5:06 is what really made the video
shoutout tucker. love that guy
chucky merchy pls
this made me chuckle.
HER SISTER WAS A WITCH👹👹👹
yeahhh i'd eat it
"What's gonna start a fire? It's an electric stove."
Honestly, I want to try and make this just to say, "Fuck it, I ate a Chuckle Sandwich!"
It’s like the appetizer from that one episode of SpongeBob where squidward becomes the boss to impress Squilliam Fancyson.
this MIGHT just kill a victorian child :3
Can't believe blatt and night vision made this amazing sanwich
Boy am I glad that Schuckle and Z (but the way that british people say it) brought the chuckle sandwich to life!
Why is he showing off a BB gun as if it's cool or something when Austin is mentioned?
Fuck
You should have mixed all of the sauces into a delicious slurry and spred that on there
I may be suicidal for saying this. But I'd honestly love to attempt to consume a Chuckle Sandwich. SOME of those ingredients go well together, so if you did it right then you could eat portions at a time, and have a different experience each bite (Like the episodes!) Edit: I too have regretted my statement after the addition of the corn beef. And Sand. That was definitely a deciding factor. But literally before that I'd be willing to take a big bite
Tucker makes me quiver
Can't believe that poor Marine had to take on Ted all by himself. What a champ!
Charlie shouldve been here 😔😔😔
Lovely video boys. I’m going to share this recipe with my grandson ❤
3:00
i’d eat it
Endured rough exam scores, this was a blessing to watch.
Who is the camera man??
schlatt looks like a kid in a trench coat
A sandwich fit for a god
jelly with bacon
Hey @jschlatt my 1998 Mercedes has an automatic “Trunk”, learn a different feature to flex with, dick head    Ps nice car
I Loved when the chuckle chumps sandwiched then proceeded to chuckle all over the place
And now we wait for babish to attempt this. A fine attempt after the adventure time sandwich
Now give it to William and have him laser cut it into vin diesel
I would prefer Alecs rather than the dollar store variant (schlatt) and with Trevor here it's so close to the Chop
Shut up Ted
When i read the title of this video i audibly gasped
I’ve been chuckle sandwiched.
Thank you for reminding me that I schat the ted.
this chuck guys funny
ted nvidia make sandwich with blanket guy
Need to laugh fr rn
Where is the fishing episode
You poor souls, don’t know what Barbacoa and how to prepare it. It’s so good 😭😭
crazy how schlapp cut the gun
HEB >>>>
It’s funny how every funny man duo always have a crony named ‘Tucker’
this is the requirement to get the true ending
11:23 so sad to see Schlatt struggle with his crippling parkinson’s disease
I think schlatt is allergic to the number 100
That sandwich looks shockingly good
I really hope thats not a real gun tucker pointed at schlatt
What did Sark add?
SuperMega❤️💙
I would eat that. Me and my grangran used to eat this every day.
THE CHUCKLE SANDWHICH.. IS ACTUALLY REAL??!! 😮😮🎉
That sandwich would kill a medieval city
I love sleep deprived overcooked ❤
dont cry over burnt bacon
sandwich of chuckle
Forgot the horse radish
this is some shit Mordecai and Rigby would destroy a planet to get a bite of
you can tell schlatt plays baseball lol
Can't believe it's already Chuckle Sandwich's 100th years anniversary. Congrats guys
Me and gramp gramp used to eat that every Sunday!! I would totally eat that!
Tucker’s aura is like a warm shining star. Beautiful yet powerful. His sheer presence is enough to make anyone cry tears of happiness. He is Tucker: The Great One. Praise be for he has graced us with his presence yet again. Be well brothers and sisters of the Chuckle.
you should remake it every hundred episodes
i love the budding romance between jonathan schlatt and trevor modestcube
"I work for Ted" is the funniest joke in this whole video.
Audio listener here, this video made me subscribe to the channel
Jschlatt is DEFINITELY a 500 year old vampire lord.
the meat that came in the bag was supposed to be microwaved in the bag
This is the type of sandwich shaggy would eat
I wonder what the gun tastes llike
oh yeah, me and my gram-gram used to make one of these every sunday! Good memories...
💯
10:17 christ
Hey guys and welcome back to Sluckle Chandwich
please make an official recipe, i gotta meal prep
The last time Schlatt got to 100 episodes of a podcast, he shot himself. I don't know if that's better or worse than having to eat that sandwich
Maybe the real chuckle sandwich is the friends we made along the way
I am a tucker LOVER
oh man, me and my gram gram would eat this every sunday...miss you gram gram
Gus Johnson lol
My stay was fucking awful My stay needed Improvement. Please
FINALLY
Wilbur’s cameo really touched me
gesticulating wtf such a good word
i can't believe they put charlie's meat in the sandwich
20:26 AYOOO
I’m so upset that they didn’t get Charlie on
Shlobb immediately pulls out the blicky
Mordecai and Rigby would go through an intergalactic journey for this sandwich.
let's gooooooooo
"that's a closed location right there" followed by the shiftiest eyes. Ted was definitely considering saying he's going steal that rainforest cafe glass, then remembered he's on camera
do you think filming this gave trevor ptsd to food lab and test kitchen
I wanted to hear Tucker talk about the tree wtf... unsubscribing
what the fuck?
my boy trevvy 🥹
This reminds me of the shit we use to make in middle school lunch
Feels a little unfitting to not have Charlie here
Everytime I see white people prepare spam, they eat it raw and say it's gross🤢 please slice and pan fry your spam people
Can't wait for the 1,000th episode when the sandwich is an inedible 3ft mound of random foods
The three of them give off such polyamorous relationship vibes
Tucker is very powerful. I would tread lightly boys
14:43 "I loosened it" 😤🙄
11:57 the fact that i fo the same thing when i get hurt
10:27 *flashbacks of "flatty patty" and the whole manberg lore*
That looks absolutely vile
Biblically accurate chuckle sandwich
6:43 i should try this.
Schlatt looks like he has football shoulder pads on under his hoodie
5:04 "silent problem kid"  Most accurate description of schlatt
Why does this actually work
Schmuck and Red are so funny 🤣🤣🤣
i would like to see a youtube chef try to make a real sandwich with all these ingredients, would be cool
Love seeing Trevor there he should be a guest in a future podcast
That sandwich is something Shaggy and Scooby would inhale without a second thought
18:08 is that trevor from offcanny behind the camera?
Congrats on 100 subscribers!!!
Congrats on 100 subscribers!!!
I KNEW IT
As a licensed Tucker lover, this video made me very happy
THIS IS NOT A PODCAST!!!
Why the fuck is the microwave on the floor BY CHOICE
i could eat that
Not enough m&ms.
i can already tell this’ll be an instant classic
Man when Ted burnt that bacon i made the weirdest noise because ive burnt bacon, but ive never BURNT IT THAT BAD?
why did schlatt point out the airb&b star rating system and not mention the most hilarious part of it "one star: call the authorities"?
I started clapping when our little cherub Tucker made an in person appearance.
re7 meal
This sandwich might be able to kill a victorian child, I'll be honest.
If this is on spotify I'm gonna be pissed cause of the length. I listen while I drive doordash
I can’t believe Ted and tucker slowly worked up an immunity to poison so they could kill Schlatt like this 😔
i'd eat it
The yelling for Tucker reminded me of Breaking Bad.
Yeah me and my gram gram would make this all the time at home
I was wondering why that car was driving off with someone saying "you can drop me off here" when I was at home depot. Actually, still wondering...
You should get Binging with Babish on the show, so he can coach you on how to transform it into an actual tasty sandwich
Fuckle Sandwich recipe when?
Need Babish to make one of these
dude this is crazy, me and gram gram would eat this every day before she beat me with the belt! thanks for reminding me of years of trauma!
3:20 SLEEP DEPRIVED MENTIONED⁉️
they forgot scott the woz and wilbur :(
I think the Challah is honestly the only part about this sandwich that I'd eat
I love our little cherub. I'm glad he's here
This is everything and more
Nice!
<3
This is like the avengers of all sandwich
Truly disgusting that some "people" would do this horrible thing.
grass and sand
I just realized that Tucker isn't actually short, Ted and Schlatt are just freakishly tall
Tucker is a fucking beast
Food hazard tp end humanity
Shlatt is fascinatingly bad at opening bears
Love how everyone’s ingredients are based off the fact that they thought it’d be a hypothetical sandwich but they have to make a new sandwich every 100 episodes now (maybe cook all of the ingredients that need to be cooked too)
"audio listeners-- LOVE YOU TO DEATH"
this is like the plot of everything everywhere all at once  the everything sandwich
tucker is such a sweet lad
Early ish for once
The line "It's chucklin sandwichin time " had me in tears it was so beautiful.
I love tucker bro just seems like a nice dude
As a diabetic, I approve of this mental overload 🙃
the meat mountain fails taste in comparison to the Chuckle Sandwich
my favourite part is when jschlong and ted nivision said in unison "now that is one chuckle sandwhich"
I can't believe they didn't chuckle their Chuckle Sandwich 😢
Now for the 200th episode, you have to do the fishing episode
Chuckle Thanksgiving feast:
tucker is the only one to make schlatt nervous about the gun. usually he's the one making people nervous with it. tbh tucker is a Marine so he probably wouldve been able to kill schlagg without even thinking about it
Tucker is such a f*cking powerhouse.
yeah so i give them 2 days before they pass on to the afterlife after eating this
I'm an audio listener and this the first time I've ever seen shlatts face.  Let's just say I'm not coming back
Big Tucker fan!
watched this while eating a BLT. I cant tell if it heightened my eating experience or worsened it. thank you.
Money
Cant believe “schlatt” said “Qué es eso Guapito” in regards to Quackity
Next episode is the long awaited Markiplier episode. It’s the last chance they give him.
Do this more chucklers
I hope "Schuabshire III" doesn't get worms from the dirt
hehe im the 666th comment
The audio quality makes this so hard to watch but I’m trying to stay strong and watch
The Chuckle Sandwich now at …..( any sandwich place; jimmy John’s, Jersey mikes, subway, idk)
i cant believe they put a real quivering member on the chuckle sandwich
11:23 relatable
Ive been listening since day 1 and I dont know what Im gonna do when this ends
a microwave isnt meant for fully cooking things oh god
You can tell schlatt has worked in kitchens while Ted has only worked retail.
I cant believe they visited Ryan and cut off his fingers to put in the sand which
1:30 ELM FANS RISE UP! THE AMERICAN ELM WILL ONE DAY MAKE A GLORIOUS RETURN
me and my gram gram eat that every sunday
Binging with babish is sweating and taking notes for his next video
If only they had unlimited bacon but no more games with which to make the sandwich
i have bought that exact ham steak several times, the actions executed in this video, well, will have my dear mother rolling in her grave (not dead but WILL ROLL)!!  and i think i’ll have to quit watching :(
they forgoot the sand
Ah, The Chuckle Sandwich never fails to take the smile out of my face!
big Man Tuck had to come in and save the bacon.
Schlatt and Ted Sandwich. Ted Sabdwich
Hey its like from the show!
I love food and cooking, and looking at the overall list I think there’s room for improving the sandwich to be actually palatable? I’ll have to do some tests lol, I think a real enjoyable Chuckle Sandwich is possible
I am Tucker's #1 fan
i could eat that
I realize I’ve never actually been on the channel before I’ve been an audio listener since the beginning
Poopy face
HELL YEAHHHHH
I will glowingly recommend this sandwich to my worst enemy
It'd be fun to see a take on this sandwich that wasn't as scuffed. An actual, legitimate attempt from somebody who knows food. This sandwich is definitely not unsalvageable. At all. Aside from the scythe and gun. You could for sure produce a sandwich with all of these elements that would probably taste good.  Somebody call Babish?
This is just a ted video on the chuckle sandwich channel
Yeah I'd eat that. Me and my Gram Gram would make this every Sunday actually
tuck has ascended from cherub to god emperor
Yo, they stole this idea from my boy @Elijah_Gillard and I
this is my favourite sandwich! my grandma used to make this exact one all the time
HELL YEAH
love how it slowly becomes inedible
If only Charlie was there
Glad to see they were able to get Squirt’s hologram working for the first ever Sandwich 👍
tucker has Daryll from Marvel energy
The rainforest cafe glass is actually awesome
The sandwich’s flavour equals its podcast quality
I love me some good old Schlatt and Bed content
they were drinking a coronas. the brand of the saw is corona. coincidence?
I had a long day today (especially when Ted came to my work and broke my kneecaps) and seeing this upload instantly made it better.
i love it when schlitt and fred make these food videos
Every YouTube video prove how unexperienced in life youtubera are
Can’t wait for season 2 with 100 more episodes and see what the next sandwich is
Yeah, I would eat that. Yeah no that's a- me- me and my gram gram eat that like every Sunday when I visit.
I was noticing a lacking of gun while the slice was happening
I love when Ted brings his XXL toddler with him!
YOU BASTARD, I ALREADY DID THAT!
This dude directed a highly professional music video this year. The parallels are hilarious.
6:42 hold on HER SISTER WAS A WITCH 😳
Live action chuckle Sandwich don’t mind if I do
Animals died for this
Yeah, I would eat that. Yeah no, actually me and my gramgram make that like every Sunday when I visit
The fucking power vacuum left by schlatt falling for his own gun bit has made tucker my new favorite chucklemaster.
Audio listeners, F&_( you, idk how you'd just listen to this amazing video
Me and my gram gram used to make this every Sunday
Can't believe they dug up Slime's grave just to liquefy his bones for this video! What dedicated friends!
If I ever own a restaurant I’ll put this on the menu, as long as one of y’all don’t diddle kids
Should've known Ted and 'Schlutt' would create the most evil sandwich to ever exist after what they did to my kneecaps back in '99.
i wonder how they’re going to get the whole scene of a guy cutting grass with a scythe
:o
Nothing like Schlunt and Tim making the ultimate consumable.
you ate Chuck The Sandwich... how could you?
they really captured the notion of cutting grass with a scythe, truly beautiful to behold. brings the whole sandwich together
Can’t believe they put cum on the sandwich.
hey bros there are children in africa  that really enjoy this podcast!
they actually did it. Pog
Schlatt drives a fucking S-Class?!
This unironically reminds me of a supermega drunk drawing video so much
"ted your right it is on fire..."
It looks appetizing
me when they say make a sandwich for class in grade 3
YEAH! the best podcast of time.
To the audio listeners who can’t see the video, schlatt and Ted are fully naked the entire time.
Make the chuckle sandwich your new pfp
what about Mark?
5:05
minus the ice and the sand... i would eat that... and the grass too but i know i wont taste that.
YEAHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
You guys gotta do an updated version at episode 200 :>
mcdonalds supports israel :/ why would u buy from them wth
I have the same microwave :)
Scooby doo looking sandwich
favorite puppy
Schlabb using that scythe/saw thing to cut into the meat reminded me of '99 when he brutally murdered my parents.
Now they can rest when ted leaves forever
…no cram?
I can’t help but notice the severe lack of gun in the sandwich as they cut it diagonally
I just want Charlie back 😢
can i just say tucker looks fuckin great in a navy blue t shirt
This looks like the monster sandwiches you make in Pokemon Scarlett.
I always forget how big these guys are until they stand up. Schlatt and Ted are built like fridges.
"Hey guys, were going to make the chuckle sandwich" *builds a biological weapon*
honey bustard pickled sea fuck combo
Someone said human skin right? Jaiden the second time? Emma? Someone unhinged
Should have saved it for the 1 mil tbh
Im so glad theyve finally made it!!!!! Beautiful loaf of shit right there boys
I’d give it a good shot. Gotta remember Ted is a liberal in LA that smells his own farts. And J is a complete man child that probably only eats chicken nuggets
Watched this while running on the treadmill!
I'm dead serious when I say I'd eat that
Schoot and Ten Venison finally made the sandwich
I can't wait to see Babish tackle this one
Together, we are Chuckle Sandwich.
They are eating human remains?
They kicked Charlie out because he didn’t meet the height requirement.
My favorite part of Chuckle Sandwich is when Schlatt initially throws a manbaby arrested development temper tantrum before changing back to normal like nothing.
You could really tell how schlatt and ted were so intimidated just by tuckers presence alone
just like my mee maw used to make 🥹
corned beef is good blame yourself for getting  a can normally it's basically the same thing as pastrami or sliced brisket
Its ok if you burn the bacon. We have plenty extra here. ❤
Love the epic meal time reboot
I can't believe you did this without Charlie...
I ain’t gay or nowt but tucker a cutie patootie
“There is no way I can do three more years of this shit”
This made me chuckle
yeah i'd eat that. me and gram gram made that like every sunday
Schlatt adding so much of everything enrages me but also makes me happy
So nice of them to make a delightful "Schlandwich"
She schlatt on my ted till I chuckle
The ultimate who would win, the chuckle sandwich or the sorry burger
i would eat that and then proceed to fuckign die
I haven't listened to a second of your podcast but I'll be here for the 200th episode when you eat shit
interesting
Where would you recommend to get the best quality notion of a man cutting grass with a scythe at sunrise? I find the one from Walmart is a bit dull...
Such a good video I wish the 100th episode wasnt the end of their lives
The barabacoa with no seasoning and straight into the microwave hurt my soul
"HER SISTER WAS A WITCH!!!" got me. congratulations and rest in peace Ted.
Chubkle Sammy
Was fundy filming?
Dude make the fucking sandwich
gun
me and my gram gram used to make this every sunday
Can you hurry up with the fucking sandwich!? I mean how much can you ramble on?
Schlatt and Trevor are such wholesome familiars
Jschlatt’s head is soo small lol
mmm i want some of teds black bacon
tucker is the most guy ever
Next milestone chuckle sandwich restaurant mr b's style
i love trevor
Where the HELL is the lime in the Corona?
Schlatt listening to Andrew Huberman is a collab I never thought I'd see
I wish charlie was there
It's a shame Charlie couldn't help.
Hooray!!!
Poor Schlatt couldn’t bear the strain any longer. 😂
I’ve had a hankering for some Schlatt/Ted irl videos for some time now
Oh yeah, tucker looks like a Marine in every good way. Love you Tucker
just remember ladies and gents if you fail at city skylines enough and complain about korean bbq you one day could be driving a crisp new S class
A whole one hundred episodes and only one member died
Outstanding 🎉
So sad they all became violently sick and died after such a epic video 😢
I WOULD HAVE said “I’d eat that,” but then Ted had to make the bacon more burnt than the Triangle Shirt Factory.🤦‍♂️  Thank god they made an actual edible batch!
love you guys
5:05
Proud to have been there since the start
You can make like 4 or 5 separate really good sandwiches out of this
is this a merc commercial
There's so much more chaos and danger to be had simply from them standing up for a video
Tucker really does have a face like a cherub
First video watched usually an audio guy. Seeing experience 6/10
Letssss fucking goooo!!
God Bless America
This was a great video hearts out to Big guy, Guy and Small guy for making this channel/podcast❤🎉
Amazing sandwich, or rather Chad-wich, now you gotta make an edible one, or not idc y’all are awesome
Nice
My and my gam gam make that every Sunday
the deltarune music was so good
I am waiting for this exact video but with a good audio quality
This is litteraly how I imagine an American sandwich
where Charlie??
tucker had a real Marine moment after that first bite
This is the best cooking video on YouTube and it’s not even a Short
NO WAY
I feel like slime should had been for this one. Like, just this one episode
I would plant a soft kiss upon tucker's forehead
3:20 you look at this and you just know this is Ted honing his direction skills
I gotta say this was probably the greatest crossover since End Game.
The title brings fear to my soul
I love how easy Tucker went on Ted when he could have pulled out some of his MCMAP and smoked his tender ass.
TUCKLER IS HERE
My favorite character in this episode is unnamed camera guy
I can't believe they made it through the video without any injuries.
4:02 ted walking schlatt 😭
Now that's a sandwich worthy of the gods. Congratulations boys on the big 100 🎉🎉
Me and my gram gram make that every Sunday
“Schlatt” drives like a dad trying to scare his children on a road trip
add me to the burger im battery acid mercury in retrograde tangeriene cleaning agent multi faceted plunger tool
How did they cut the gun?
me and my gram gram make this every sunday
the sandwich is real!!!!!
Never thought I’d see live action chuckle dungeon
Ted I think it needs another stick of butter
That looks so fkin delish
quit using bottle openers, use your teeth like a REAL MAN
No one has ever made a sandwich consisting of such ingredients before this video
i cant wait for bingeing with babish to remake this but actually edible
I've never felt more hungry and disgusted in my life. Thanks bois ❤
Did you guys buy the original cowchop house from colorado?
This is the perfect podcast to listen to while making a sandwich
I feel like we could've gotten a bit more scythe action going on
i knew this would be a disaster as soon as i saw how they were stacking the ingredients ONLY in the middle lmAOO
Tucker definitely Earned his Carhartt
Wrong meat on episode one Charlie says turkey as he is listing the ingredients
WHEN IS THE CHUCKLE SANDWICH FISHING EPISODE GOING TO HAPPEN?!  also love this sm
I knew our lil cherub would like it. He was military after all
yeah i would eat that. me and my gram-gram make that every sunday
5:31 Tucker, the mildly concerned friend watching as the other two nearly injure each other making a sandwich: 👍🏽😊
Miss Our SuperMega Boys, LETS GET THEM HOME! #FreeSuperMega
Some fan is going to eventually stumble into this Air B&B and realize they've accidentally discovered a holy relic. As well as Ted's dent in the fridge.
out of all seriousness, I'm concerned for "slat". He has a history of passing out, and it's scary .
Bro i got offended when shlat said corned beef was horible coz i love it so much i eat it by its self 😭
This shirt looks like Ted was fated to wear it.
I’m glad they got authentic barbacoa 💀
This vid was great, very funny and entertaining. Happy 100
And then they said "It's chuckling time" and chuckled all over the sandwich. Truly the podcast episode of ever
10/10 recipe! will make again! help me!
Food?
Honestly, if I wasn't a vegetarian, I'd eat that.
Yea I would eat that. Yeah no, me and my gram gram make that every Sunday when I visit
fun fact: schlatt used that same gun to shoot me in the kneecaps whenever i asked him for a picture when i saw him in a trader joe's parking lot. it was great meeting you javid schletterman!
I bet that tasted delicious
loved the part where ted and schlatt shouted "tucker time" and oiled up the boy and put him on the sandwicj
curious as to how danny's is gonna fit in here
Danny's was supposed to be in the early morning.
Tucker is so cute
Scythe-cut grass is strong
culckle
it is on this day in history schlatt & ted created the chuckle sandwich
Cool
YEAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH
ted didnt even eat he barely even touched it
reign orange dreamsicle is a goated energy drink just wanted to point that out good taste
Should’ve had some milk and honey in the background for swagger
The only person to scare Schlatt. is Tucker.
scooby doo ass sandwhich
This is how "Schlatt" gets over what he did in 1999.
Glad to see after all these years, Trevor is still collateral damage when filming two idiots in a kitchen - RIP cc
Looks like the start of a gay porn lol
I just realized they never asked Sark what he would be
I’ve never been this terrified in my whole life
very cool.
love this deleted episode of 'the bear'
Great video! Goof job! 👍
We need merch of this amazing sandwich
Shlobb on my knob immediately shlobbs on my knob
Average day for Scooby and Shaggy
They should mail this to Charlieis coffin
they should send a bit of the sandwhich to every podcast guest as a thank you, itll warmen up their day ☺☺
Watching Chuckle Sandwich make a Chuckle Sandwich, while eating a sandwich, and having a chuckle.
Tucker got the hot shit-mid-30's-midwestern-man-running-the-front-end-of-a-grocery-store build
tucker gives me elon musk vibes
Bread Nivision. JSchreddy Cheddy. Tucker Carlzone.
Chuckling
This did not make me chuckle
shameless stealing of another persons video. reported
I’m chuckling
the AI of shlitt is really well done in this video. It's like he is still with us...
Me and my Gram Gram ate that every sunday
Hot
Me and my uncle eat this all the time
I just realized that for some reason, every time they described the chuckle sandwich in an episode I imagined a burger. Like everything is stacked on top of each other.
This put a very real smile on my face
Tucker is 🐐
Men born after 1997 can’t cook. All they know how to do is chuckle sandwich, be bisexual and lie
schlatt took that bike like a man
history was made today
Certified Chuckle Sandwich Moment
i can't believe it's already the 100th year anniversary
I actually came across Ted and “Schlatt” after this video, and when they saw me “schlagg” pulled his BBG and put two holes in my left knee, while I was screaming Ted actually pulled the sandwich out of his milk bags and proceeded to shove it down my throat, after he got it wedged in my face he proceeded to waterboard me with thick water while breaking my right kneecap while “schlurt” and tucker laughed, I had some trouble breathing so “schlumpus” put a hole in my neck so I could keep breathing. I am currently in Austin State Hospital awaiting surgery and a $500000 medical fee I was hoping to instead spend on purchasing a small child. Great meeting you guys 😊!
shlorgut has gaslighted me into HATEING ted for no reason i genuinely feel like i have been manipulated into being a Ted hater instead of a tucker hater  (fuck you tucker haters)
Can't belive Scahlum canonically died on the 100th episode of TWO podcasts!
I can't wait to see what unholy abomination of a Chuckle Sandwich they make for 200 episodes
kids in africa couldve eaten that
Tucker needs to be an official cohost
Finally, the monstrosity is real!
You should make this like a seasonal series where every 100 episodes you make a different chuckle sandwich of the last 100 episodes
That Wilbur cameo with the sudden jump cut made the video several times better
I love you guys, hope you do more stuff like this <3.
You gotta tag everyone in the description to see their part of the sandwich
bed and shlagg really did it!
11:59 DAMN I didn't know the Big Guy was a professional soccer player
That’s the microwave we have 10:05
SILLIEST
the fact that three grown men are so insanely inept in basic kitchen/cookery skills to where they end up asking if shit like corned beef and ham steaks are cooked and also just not knowing how a can opener works shows us what the major celebrity lifestyle does to people, also ted fucking burned bacon what a stupid prick lol
I wanna eat that
Schlatt pelting Ted with tidepods and Ted not retaliating with a harder throw is some serious self control
Amazing!!!
seems delicious
schlatt made slicing through that gun look like cake, I dont want to end up on his list any time soon for sure.
Yeah yeah I would eat that me and my gram gram make that every Sunday
Schlatt unironically is my rolemodel
Music is on point, man.
5:07 you can hear cameraman glugling
At first I wanted to try that sandwich but after I seen the after math I don’t want to anymore…
Schlek and Ted never cease to make me laugh, thank you for the 100 episodes of pure joy!
Yeah, me and my gram gram made this every sunday after church.
You boys are in for a real treat! Me and my gram gram have this every Sunday 😊
i’ve never seen someone cook bacon so poorly that it turned GRAY
the shot of the bacon cooking and then ted and tucker fighting in the background is a modern renaissance painting
give me 5grams of weed, a good movie and probably a fork and I'll eat that.
'let me pop the automatic trunk' bro thinks he's the real 'jschatt'
Looks like such a yummy sandwich. I'm a long-term chuckler now.
With in the first two minutes this immediately made up for the lack luster 100th episode. Welcome back to glory boys
Beautiful creation
I wonder if tucker was joking about the fire to fuck with ted or is he was serious
The greatest crossover ever, they are all in the sandwich.
this has some classic filthy frank max mofoe cake video vibes. not as horrific and vomit inducing
Now we need a rendering of that sandwich as the new logo
Hey, Tucker Slimecicle looks a lot different to how he did in the earlier episodes, glad to see him back on camera tho.
Slight human cake vibes
Now that the sandwich has been made, they have to lay in it. There can never be another addition to the sandwich.
That was a chuckle sandwich alright
ted rockin the matpat in five nights at freddys movie fit
yum
Multiple issues that need improvement 4/5
Look don’t like kill me here but like I feel like tucker is a transphobic cuz there was like sort of a recent episode where schlatt was talking about how a man would wear a dress and tucker was like drop it. Look I know that tucker haters fuck you but I feel like a good amount of chucklers are from the lgbtq community and honestly idk what I want maybe for us to address it or tucker admit actually I guess there’s not really enough evidence but still I’m tucked hater now ain’t gonna lie.
Tucker looks like Elon Musk if he had a normal human body.
holy shit why didn't i get a bite >:/
That sandwich is probably one of the best tasting warcrimes of all time.
Plot Twist: Charlie was the cameraman
Guys, who else is chuckin their sandwich to this?
You forgot to agressively chuckle at the sandwich
me and gram gram make this every sunday
what kind of staus effects would this even give you
i wouldn’t eat anything you guys made 🥰🥰🥰
This could have actually been a great sandwich, if they prepared it properly.
how come... Ted said... we're drinking beers... and then took a sip of... Corona? that doesnt make sense...
Wasnt there supposed to be a foreskin...
I wonder if that Airbnb uses pesticides to keep the grass looking nice...
This video makes me miss Trevor :')
GOD, tucker is so fucking hot!!!!!
If only Charlie lived to see this moment
Me and my gram-gram eat that every sunday when I
“thats a heart attack on a bun”
where is the markepliar sour patch kid?
Schlatt gives off short, lil guy energy. It makes me uncomfortable seeing how tall he is on camera. Hopefully this will be addressed and corrected in the next video. Thanks in advance!
holy fuck i’ve been waiting for a new schlatt and ted video
Wow this sandwich looks so good! Me and my gram gram would makes this exact same sandwich every Sunday!
Ted, buy some GOSH DANG lav mics.
Nice schload
4:10 schlort was already drinking before yall went for that drive
Boy dinner
Ted Vison please tag me
My favourite scene was when Schlbb said "it’s Schlubbin time!“ and then he schlobbed all over the screen.
THIS IS WHAT THE PEOPLE WANTED
When New Yorkers move to Texas so they can own more guns...lawl
LETS FUCKING GOOO!!!
ily 😘
17:37 "That was the tipping point" -Tucker 2023
HI TREVOR!
“You gotta stop”, but Ted knew schlagg would never stop.
You know it’s a good food video if Trevor is yakking in the background.
This episode is favorite puppy
schlatt drives like me
I love jshleeb and tod navson they make some great sandwiches
Yeah I would eat that. Me and my gram-gram eat that every Sunday
I love all forms of ted nivison, tucker and schlut content!
The corned beef, as always, completely ruined a beautiful thing.
“Que es esto guapito???” 😭🤚
how could you freeze regular water for this
Finally…. Sandwich
We're begging you Tucker, please stop Ted before its too late
when schlatt said "its chuckling time" i lost it. Marvel movie screaming audience worth line
It just gets progressively worse 😂
Next have mythical chef Josh make the chuckle sandwich
Absolutely vile concoction. This thing should have never seen the light of day but pushing limits is what it's all about about, can't wait for the primordial soup after a 100 more.
@derekdraws
I had a sandwich once. It made me chuckle.
I can't believe it, it's been 100 years of Chuckle Sandwich
this the shit that shaggy and scoob eat
lov tucker
I miss charlie tho
I think it would have been really cool if they had Charlie on for this, and he just had like, a tub of mystery meat for the sandwich
Before the sand it was borderline edible lmao
17:44 HE SAID IT!!    HE SAID THE THING!!!
Seeing videos of Schalg alive still bring me to tears 😢😢😢
clearly you are supposed to think of a man cutting grass while eating the sandwich or it doesn’t count
What a beautifully disgusting sandwich. Thank you for 100!
hearing schlatt and ted speaking spanish was the highlight of my day
I hope they do this again at 200 episodes to see how its changed
I genuinely cried when "Schaltt" said "It's chuklin' time" and chuckled all over the place
This was a great video 👍
I hope that you guys do the fishing episode someday.
Have neither of them ever cooked anything?
no shot
The world isn't ready for this.
We need the shlopcts and theeds secret sauce for the fuckle sandwich
shut up
Slab really had to add the FUCK YOU, BORUFF
You better add the concept of farming
nice <3
Holy shit my favorite food is sandwiches and this one looks SO good.
Camera man needs to control his gagging, I’m trying to watch art
ITS CHUCKLIN TIME
Holy fuck that's my local home depot. wtf, it's genuinely like, close to where I live... Do I live near shalagg?
Schlobb immediately pulls out the blicky
tucker being a bit of a nature nerd in the beginning made my day

Fucking finally, god
I know where they live now....
Tucker up'd that mf immediately 😂
So glad to finally see this type of content from you guys, hopefully more of this comes out later because this is amazing
So excited for chuckle sandwich 2
Im ngl i would eat this
i loved the part where they both said "together, we are the chuckle sandwich!" in sync made me chulk in happiness
I didn't expect at 5:04 to hear a regurge sound when schlatt throws a tidpod at him
We got the real chuckle sandwich before gta 6
i enjoyed this video and also realised that perfection does not exist.
i bet there are some times that charlie is glad he left. i think this is all of them
Been waiting for them to create the sandwich for years
Finally, the chuckle sandwich
When schlatt personally came on the sandwich it made me cry
Tucker is so funny, so glad that he’s apart of the podcast! Tucker lovers unite 🫡
FUCK YEAAAAAAH
Truly one of the sandwiches of all time!
This is the perfect example of why the American society will collapse and the Turkish empire will come back bigger and stronger than ever.
Oh yeah I would eat that me and my gram gram would make it every Sunday
Oh man me and my gram gram made that sandwich every Sunday
Tucker, u should used ur tan belt mcmap training to take Ted down, I'm disappointed, the Hollywood choke was on point lmao
THE GUN
Tucker kind of looks like Elon Musk, but instead of Tucker being the good version of Elon Musk I theorize that Elon is actually the dark distorted version of Tucker.
Schlandwich
Barbacoa looks bad cause it's American made, you need that authentic shit
the two food groups of Chuckle Sandwich guests: Pickles and bacon
This is like a Filthy frank video
yes
I can always count on Chuckle Sandwich to be a good influence of gun safety
Schlubble always makes me smile so much!
Schlaggalicious.
Too bad there’s no slime  I was so very wrong
I think charlie should be here
the prophecy has been fulfilled
where slimecicle
Sukuna vs Mahoraga < Fraud Nivison vs Goatucker
Now that I think about it, Will Neff did kinda put me on to crushed chips on sandwiches. Goated choice.
They did it! THEY FINALLY CHUCKLE SANDWICHED!
no way "schlatt" and "ted niggason"  went into an "AirBnB" kitchen together. WE SAW YOU IN JAPAN, YOU CANNOT HIDE, AND WE KNOW WHAT YOU DID. Don't think for a damn second you tricked us.
schlatt's built like a live action mario movie goomba
of all the possible ingredients, pickles is the most common
me and my gram gram actually make this sandwich every sunday when i go visit her, what a world!!!
thank you for your service kings
THE CHUCKLE SANDWICH IS REAAAAAAAAAAAAL
Couldn’t even edge to this, I exploded immediately!!! Clean up on aisle MY PANTS 😂😂😂😂
i literally made a video of me making the chuckle sandwich a year ago, im hoping yours is as terrifying as mine!!
This shits better than end game
LETS GOOO TUCKER YEAAAAAAHHHH I love this guy
love that you bring trevor along
I was legitimately wanting to barf during the entire process of making the sandwich
I love how well, in these past months, tucker has taken the role of [̸̢̗̀R̷̭̐E̵̗͘D̷̬̩̚A̶͓̝͂C̶̬̦̓T̷͓̓E̷͉͖͝Ḓ̶̝̃̅]̸̰̏, although it truly is a shame how [̸̢̗̀R̷̭̐E̵̗͘D̷̬̩̚A̶͓̝͂C̶̬̦̓T̷͓̓E̷͉͖͝Ḓ̶̝̃̅]̸̰̏ mysteriously blew up from a pretty weird pipe bomb and as any chuckler would they would really miss [̸̢̗̀R̷̭̐E̵̗͘D̷̬̩̚A̶͓̝͂C̶̬̦̓T̷͓̓E̷͉͖͝Ḓ̶̝̃̅]̸̰̏ yet it’s great to see tucker not just be the guy who searches up things but apart of the show 👍
6:14  *sob* i cant believe they turned him into schmeat
Yaaaaaay finally
Oh God I think I'm boutta Chuckle everywhere
Peak
CHUCKLE CHUCKLE
Shat's a little violent fella aint he.
I would eat that
God schlatt has some cakes🎂🎂
why is ted pulsating
Epic video can’t believe it’s 100 episodes in
I never expected Schlatt to be so tall. I always envisioned him as a small little whiny guy who was like 5’ 5”.
I can't wait to follow this recipe! I am sure my family will love when I bring this to Thanksgiving!
That part when Schlatt said "I'm 'bout to chuckle" was truly emotional. Thank you.
i schlame everywhere while watching this video
Tucker be like.. gimmie that Schlatt I'll show you how to use it.
this gotta be the next best thing after filthyfranks cake trilogy
The greatest sandwich!
Tuckers trigger discipline is good but pointing it at schlitts noggin is a no no!
Schlatt's gotta get himself a little cherub intern boy
Now make the fuckle sandwich!
