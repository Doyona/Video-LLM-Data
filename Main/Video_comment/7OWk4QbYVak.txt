You guys are so funny!! I was literally watching Gilmore Girls at the same time ahen Eamon said about Stars Hallow well Bec actually
22:10... wish I could have been there. Would have mudded and taped for you. It`s easy!
Drywall is easy!!!
I think you should get a professional builder
I know that most people say you don't need insulation in interior walls. However, you have very harsh winters in Canada. Why didn't you put some insulation in the wall of that guest bedroom before you drywalled it?
You guys are amazing! Love watching your videos!
Rewatching the cabin build for the 3rd time and seeing Lee on FaceTime being so positive for drywall warmed my soul and brought a huge smile to my face I had to jump back a couple seconds to see her again ❤
OMG- I missed the opportunity of winning a VAN? I’m a year or five behind on opportunity of winning a cool prize! So bummed. I need to catch up on your videos. Lol.
I'm so proud of y'all.
Sorry for the late drywall hanging tip, but never have a drywall seam run above or below the corner of a window or doorway as you did at 13:30 when you hung your first sheet.  Expansion and contraction of the house will cause the mud to crack at that seam.  By now, you 've probably already developed a crack along the seam of that doorway.   Your first sheet should have started at the wall and covered the doorway.   Once you get the top sheet hung, use your reciprocating saw to cut out the doorway.  When hanging drywall, you have to plan for doors and windows so the sheet does not terminate at the edge of a door or window.
you guys are way crazy to mudd and tape...i'm hoping theres a video on it
you stagger your joints...you use a rotozip, I can do this with my eyes closed....love it  wish I saw this a while back, i'd have come and helped man...I love you guys...your awesome and you didn't even get to the mudding part...it's 10x harder than hanging rock...I love watching this though...makes me feel like i'm not just some dumb drywall spray foam guy  if you have any issues please feel free to have eamon hit me up...i'm sure the project stopped by now
I do drywall for a living...haha..and spray foam...whoever sprayed it did a great job
More drywall🤪🤪🤪
That trailer needs a jockey wheel. 🤣
I like how Eamon measure  "From here to My nipple."  :)
Dear Eamon and Bec.  Please love your backs!!!   Being a landscape gardener all my life I am now suffering from a messed up back. The thing with backs is there is no warning and then you are crippled!!!
You guys ROCK !!!!
The discussion about the angle gave me flashbacks to lole every discussion my buddy and I had when buiöding something 😂
5:34 Lee!!!!! :(
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣…..
Look who it was Trent (and Allie)!!!!!
BTW, I love your vids.
You would have benefited greatly by spending more time googling ""HOW TO" before you started. Yes you got the walls covered, however, you created a lot more mudding and sanding for yourself.  If you contract it out, they will charge quite a bit more because you created more work for them.
5:34 Lee is so positive, optimistic and supportive. I Iove her spirit and love you guys! Thanks for sharing.
If a right triangle use: A squared plus B squared equals C squared. C squared being the longest side
Trent!!!  I knew there was a reason I loved you two!  If Trent and Allie like you, you have to be good people!
Everyone discouraged you from doing the drywall yourselves - except Lee. She was the only one who said you could do it, and she was right. This world is a sadder place without her in it. ❤️😢🙏🏽
Lee ❤️😔
Question: why wouldn’t you put up insulation in the ceilings? It would quieten footsteps above and be better with energy consumption, right?
Oh my word. Dry wall is just....ouch. I redid my bathroom in my old house and well....nothing is straight. Mudding is hard, but I was blessed my dad is great at it.
We did our own basement and when the walls were wonky, we decided to stucco... hides all the mistakes and warms up a room with a little texture.
Rewatching some of your older videos while doing homework and seeing Lee made me smile <3 I have had many a friend suffer from depression and one of which you ended their life because of it. I can not imagine how you are all feeling at this moment but please know that I am sending all of my love and support to you! :)
5:35 Lee believes in you. 💜 For someone I never knew she will be so missed.
So Eamon & Bec should definitely build stairs from the main floor to the basement and make it into something fun to utilize the whole cabin..? 😁
Eamon is a trooper ha, ha
Law of average; get the nos out of the way until you get a yes! or that one friend that just says go ham!!! We can learn anything we want, all you need to do is search how to do it!
🏠👍
I didn't see you guys putting any insulation between the studs. When you were hanging the drywall in the guest bedroom. To help keep the room warm, and sound deaden it, during the full moon fever nights !
Your trip to town reminded me more of Beetlejuice. They go to the hardware store for one item...then, off into the river. Love the channel. New sub. 😊
My tip and it works every time really, get a bloody gyprocker 🕺🥁🎷🎻🎼drywaller , I live it and its no stress, we finally finished drywalling after 31 years in our previous had it just right and sold it...
Drywall is so easy. I don't know, why so many people were telling you not to do it.  It gets easier when you cut on the white side and break it. Then, you just have to cut the brown paper side of the plasterboard and job done. When I fix plasterboards to the studs I mark the centre of the stud (on the floor and ceiling) and use chalk line to mark where the screws have to go.  For fine tuning use a block of wood. You can "shave" the plasterboard this way. It's messy, but for small adjustments it's much better than cutting it with a knife.
Just found your channel thru Trent and Allie, loving your adventures! I’ve entered several Omaze giveaways in the past. 😊
Eamon- get some YouTheory Turmeric and balance strength between back, glutes and core. Hopefully will help your back 4ever. 😘
Legit you both are a riot to watch, out of ALL the bloggers I have watched you two I could binge for hours and it's like I'm watching to of my bros just work. So down to earth, you guys are killing it and the hard work is paying off. So proud for you both! Big fan of this progress ❤️
wow that was a rank drywall job
Looove watching u guys. It was a crazy week here in Houston!!!! Hope ya'll give out another sweater soon!
I want 2 c this 2 when they 90! The love is in the air! Luv it
Wowwwwe👍
yall sponsored by milwaukee or what
Awesome videos sorry I’m sooo late
Eamon, a great you tubers for stretching n helping with pain is Bod & Brad. Both are PT and can help you get the stretching n strengthening your lower back.
"It's very small" *is bigger than my whole house*
Eamon, didn't anyone teach you how to negotiate the trailer alone?  The following is how I used to do my boat trailer by myself. 1. Find or cut yourself a stump 8"-10" diameter by about 2" taller than the height of the hitch on your truck. 2. Place the stump next to and close to the end of the trailer tongue 3. Lift the tongue of the trailer onto the stump,  4. Back the truck up just under the tongue,  5, Remove the stump, lowering the trailer tongue onto the hitch ball 6. Make necessary connections and drive away. ONWARRRRD!
I totally just entered that omaze thing! Here is hoping!
Semangat maju sukses
Wow, y’all definitely got me giving my bro-in-law props for doing drywall as a job... didn’t know how difficult it was until watching this.
Amazing one video I'm addicted can't stop watching
Catching up, 3 videos in one night lol. You two work so well together ❤
Brave souls! That’s what I ❤️ about them!   Btw  Happy  Valentine’s  Day to ya both! 🥰😍
You could  put a cement brick under you trailer head to help
You didn’t need a protractor 😂 as long as you have one angle (the 90 degree one here) and the length of two sides you’re good (because the other angle just depend on the length of the sides). So  Eamon probably just figured out the length of one of the sides wrong 😬😬 anyways haha just wanted to do my nerd here, sending lots of love from Belgium !!
WHERE DID YOU GUYS GET YOUR BED SHEETS?!?!?!?!?!
Can I please ask where you got your intro done please?
“Who runs the world..? NERDS. Who got it wrong? Buddy!” I haven’t laughed that hard in awhile 😂😂
I am 80 years old and would like the van to vacation in
Recorded horizontally😀👍
When are you going to announce the winners?
Who'd have thought watching someone drywall could be so entertaining! Very funny guys.
It's a good idea to insulate & "soundproof" the wall between the two bedrooms. Your family and guest won't hear the goings-on in your side of the bedrooms if you know what I mean ;)
Eamon, where’d you get those sick glasses????
What’s the name of band in in opening

Don’t hesitate to get back issues checked out...seriously. I “threw out my back” and was in bed for 3 days then went back to life as normal. Apparently I had several bulging discs and like 6 weeks later I bent over to change our youngest’s diaper, no big deal, and fell to the floor screaming. I was right next to the couch and it took 3 hours to get onto the couch. Couldn’t get up for literally anything, for over 36 hours. We should have called an ambulance but didn’t because we knew how expensive it would be. Overall, it would have saved us a lot of time and money to do that. I ended up barely doing anything about it (we have 6 kids as we are a blended family and with custody schedules with both our exes, and everything involved with 6 kids, our life is INSANE) and just wanted to muscle through it like I always did everything else in my life. It took almost a year of being bedridden 80-90% of the time, but I finally got an MRI and had not one, not two, not three, but FOUR herniated discs. We tried for months to do every treatment option besides surgery. Finally, after a year and a half of being bedridden, I got the surgery on the worst herniated disc (apparently getting surgery on herniated discs doesn’t actually stop back pain, so they operated on the one that made me walk with a literal zombie walk and caused so much pain over the others). It cost almost 4K out of pocket, and then 3 weeks after the surgery, I herniated the exact same disc AGAIN. This herniation was twice as big as the one before, and was going to get serious very quickly. I was in surgery again, 3 days after we found out it re herniated. Had to pay the same amount again, even though it was a month later, because I hit my out of pocket maximum for insurance with the first surgery, but at the end of the year, in December. So in January, I had to hit the out of pocket maximum AGAIN. ‘Cause you know, who with 6 kids that paid like 2k for treatments leading up to the surgery, can’t then afford two 4k surgeries only a month apart? 🤦🏼‍♀️ Anyway, I’m sure based on how you acted afterwards, it might not be serious, but it’s worth getting checked out. Once you start having disc issues, your life will likely be changed forever, and not in a good way. I used to be able to do anything physical I wanted, and prided myself on how tough I was. Now I’m being told I’ll likely never be able to pick up any of my children again. Who even knows about any of the other things I used to be able to do, like bend over to pick something up, lay on my bed without having to get in it a very slow and specific way that sucks, run, jump, lift anything over 4 pounds, and the list goes on. I was only 28 when this happened, and even now, I’m only 30, and my life will never be the same again. I’ve been through the ringer, physically too, in my lifetime. Everything else healed just fine. But back issues, especially discs, are so different. They get very little blood flow and it’s hard to do anything about that. This tiny little thing in your back can seriously affect the way you move every single part of your body, it’s mind blowing how much it can set you back.
My 33 yro daughter is the same way!!! NO EMPATHY, CONCERN or CARE when it comes to boo boos or ouchies, including blood!!! What is WRONG with these girls???🤦😪
The FACT you DIDNT LISTEN to BOB & TRENT shows just how completely stubborn you are when you could have had it done CORRECTLY the FIRST time!!! 5 thumbs down on this video👎👎👎👎👎
did you just put the ceiling in with no insulation ?
Where is Dogui🐶
Go for it give everything a go as Bob said that’s how you get better but not about dry walling 😂👍 don’t know about there but in the uk we have to have pink plaster board behind a fire (fire rated plaster board)
Bec, you're SO beautiful! 😍
I like the yellow color and the style of your eye wear. Looks preppy.
The girl looks like the girl in the movie Love Story. Best wishes!
Am I too late again? Nooooo
I think you two have been doing an awesome job with your renovations and keeping your unity while going through it! Beck, I have been married 18yrs and my Hubba Bubba becomes my 5th baby whenever he gets sick! Lol
What happened to the guy that was helping you?
The tape and mudding isn’t the difficult part, it’s the dust from sanding. It gets everywhere even in closed cupboards! Looks great!
Yes! Come to Mexico!!!
I don’t think you two are crazy! I think you are courageous for attempting to do this work! And you have reaped the benefits of your efforts!!! Great job!!
I think the wood paneling is better and it can be painted why do people spend money on dry wall if it already has paneling
Don’t make me fly over there to press the upload button it looks fucking cold
Hurry up you fuckiing sexy people new video plz your late
Hello can you upload the new video please don’t make me talk to my wife
love those little cuts like the cofee one 11:27 - 11:30 sweet ... :)
Why did you change the title...?
Backing up to the trailer and hitching it up was really funny!!!
I love your videos, but I am an OLD OLD  person and don't know how to get re root, so I guess this will be the last video of yours that I will see. You both are amazing.
What an epic job guys, well done😁👍
Yessss I’m so stoked about reroot being back!! I actually listened to your old episodes the other day and I’ve been dyyyying for a new podcast to listen to while I drive! (Delivery driver here!)
When you mud, try "wet " sanding. That way you won't have sheetrock dust EVERYWHERE!! Then a wet rag is all you need. Been there done that !
Congratulations for all you have done.
My family has been doing drywall and taping for over 30 years and you guys did a great job. Mud is my favorite part and I think you guys are gonna love it. 😍
So glad I stumbled along your channel a few months ago, you two are so inspiring and are living the life that I am striving to live myself. Thank you for all the inspiration, the great storytelling and camerawork. The effort you too put into these videos is incredible and I look forward to every upload! :)  P.S.  The cabin is looking great! You guys are really doing an amazing job! Even if you don't have a protractor ;)
You will hate the mud, sand, then mud, then sand, then mud again.
I would just do a stencil in hard plastic, but heh I have NO idea but that's how I did a mirror on a sloppie roof.
Y'all can mud and tape. You'll be fine. Before you go very far you'll have it. After all, you're going to watch like fifty YouTube tutorials first, right?
When she said he hadn't looked so cute for awhile I immediately thought of his hair cut!
In the UK it doesn't even matter if there's little gaps in the boards or the odd cut not straight as we scrimp tape over the joins anyway before bonding and scimminng with plaster
Install a Trailer Jack with a Castor roller on the bottom
You look good in glasses bro!
Do not mud and tape. A good taper fixes the mess that a bad drywaller does. It's hard, and done properly it is tedious. Done properly the taper will take about three days to finish a room, with multiple applications etc. It is a hard job, that you should hire out. IMO.
Do y'all have a link for your work boots? They are so cute and I would love to have some. Also love the videos they are amazing💕
Leave the mud and taping to the experts!  please please insulate the walls between guest and yours...you would be surprised what you can hear and not wanna hear if you catch my drift!
Doing Dry Wall is a piece of cake, I would rather be doing that then the painting.. But both are routine maintenance. Get the right compound and take it easy with it, unless you want to be sanding forever  I found your page today 2/5/21 somehow through Trent and Allie, I'm thinking he is joking on saying he is gonna let someone else mud and tape.... hahahaha If not he is gonna get some hate hahahaha when that time comes..
Eamon where are your  sunglasses from?!
Nice!
My stepfather over  sanded the mud its not easy hire some one to help you. Don't be stupid  especially if you want it to look nice.
Hi 😊 Since you're in a cold climate I'm just curious why you're not insulating the ceiling or the walls.  I see some spray foam on the outside wall but why not the inside walls for added warmth and a sound barrier?
Great job! I loved the quick cabin tour!
Bec seems so happy and funny a goofy in this video! I love it - you made me smile so much throughout. Always enjoy watching you guys 💕
Yes you can.  I did it.  If I can do it, anyone can.
Secret to drywall...make seams as few and no gaps...then tape with a good tape (paper vs other kinds) use THIN coats of mud, let dry, take wet sponge and go over, take off any excess, let dry, repeat process until you have an almost perfectly blended seam.  Let dry...sand.  Brush sanding remains off, base coat, then top coat of paint.  Ceilings are especially difficult...but you can rent a thingie which will hold dry wall panel up to ceiling so that you can attach it.  If I were you, I would pay someone to do ceilings...someone who is experienced!  Good luck.  Love your videos.  You two are so adorable and fun to watch together.  Blessings!
I swear 5:10 is Steve Martin
How do you remove snow from a roof with a rope? First, you should tie your hammer on to one end of the rope, creating a makeshift weight. Once you're on the roof, toss the hammer on to the ground (but don't forget to hold on to the other side of the rope!) Once you've dropped the hammer, wrap the rope around the edge of the piled snow.
To take care of that back you're gonna need some chickens, a goat, and if you can, a cow, since you're on a homestead anyways.
Can you enter the van comp if you live in the UK?
You are not crazy at all you guys are amazing
Me: an American who is very angry for people not wearing masks and following restrictions, watching Bec talk about Covid in Ontario: 'Only one person is allowed in the store at a time'  Me: I should move to Canada
🤣 I love how you measure. Its from here to my nipple length  Rofl
We call it plasterboard in the uk 🤓 my husband and I plasterboarded our staircase and yes protractors and lots of calculations were needed. We called in the professionals for the actual plastering though 😅
Hi gies, very positive video. I would like to invite you to my channel too :))
Montage appreciated
I’ve drywalled. Messy, good learning curve, wear a respirator mask, prepare for drywall dust everywhere, watch some videos on it, don’t skip on tools. Start in a place it won’t show all the time to practice. Have fun. If I can learn, so can you.
Injection foam insulation may help you out a bit... it helps with noise dampening and can help with energy efficiency.
Canada Right? I live in Florida yet I insulated between the room walls,exterior walls,ceiling between floors as well as the Ceiling below the roof as you should be also... Because of this insulation my power bill is rarely over 100 bucks and that's running a reverse cycle heat pump year round.... Really Eamon you can't insulate too much
I am currently drywalling “by my self”, a bathroom and bedroom. Ceiling and walls, everything. You can’t have too much plaster. Fill in those gaps first with plaster, then lay tape on wet plaster and use more plaster to fill in the wholes in and around the tape. Then use even more plaster to even it out. You would rather have a little too much plaster then not enough! Really. It’s a pain in the $&&, to sand it even and level, but that to me is the hardest part; sanding. Good luck. And remember to use many layers of paint (white ) first. Then paint your others colors if you want.  Oh by the way: always put factory edge cuts to factory edge cuts. Put your cut edges in corners and on the floors. This always makes it easier to cover your mistakes when cutting drywall. Measure twice cut once, but I find with drywall measure four times and cut once. Measure and measure until your tape measurer breaks! LoL “just kidding“.
Would you mind sharing... Where I could get one of those ladders 🪜 for Myself!!♡
Awesome Videos guys...I appreciate them a lot! Can someone tell me the name or artist of the song which is played at 0:58?
hey my name Emilie and I love watch your cabin build vlog I watch it every week thank you for making them really help with lockdown in uk x
Great job with the drywall guys!
Hi, idk if u already answered this, but what’s gonna happen to your van?!? Bc I will happily buy that! (kidding, but really, what’s gonna happen to the van?)
Just do it!! lol
get big knife will help
I don't understand that big deal about doing the drywall, taping and mudding yourself... I guess maybe because my dad has done it for so many years himself, and now my husband has been doing it on our house. I understand it can be a pretty big job, especially depending on the size of the project. Crazy thing is, my dad is in his mid 60's, has terrible knees/back/hands, but loves doing drywall, taping and mudding. haha Love watching the progress y'all are making on your cabin! Can't wait to see more! <3
I've done the mudding in 2 different houses, not that hard. You may want to watch a tutorial to get started. I'd rather do the mudding then hang the drywall. You guys can do it, no problem.
I love Trent. In a strictly platonic sense...maybe? Dunno if I could say no if he made the first move.
Hey Eamon and Bec! U have  inspired me and when i get older i really want to live in a van too but my big question is how do u get money do u work or dont? X
Mudding and taping is my least favorite thing to do, of all the things I have ever done. Contract it out. Hanging is the honeymoon phase, mudding and taping is your wife taking the house, the car, the kids and getting alimony.
Well at least mud and tape and coat like one room or wall first ... so you can see how it goes ... that way you will see how your screws and joints affect your later detailed work ... but it looks like you already got all the drywall up anyway.  Endless videos online on how to do this.  Hire someone to do one room and then compare the results.
The Cabin is looking good, Greetings from New Zealand ☺
Cute the front first not the back
Mud it yourself! It’s easy. Look up VancouverCarpinter on YouTube. Drywall finishing explained at its best
Prop the tongue of the trailer up next time.
What is drywall ?
Sanding is the worst part so have a good quality one!
Actually hanging the drywall board is not that big of a deal, but do yourself a favour and hire a PRO to tape and mud the seams. A good mud job can save a not so good hanging job and even an excellent hanging job can be ruined by poorly executed taping and mudding. Don't be downhearted, some trades are a magical mix of science, art, skill, practice and a bit of MAGIC!
Assume job you guys can figure out how to get it done. Love you content 😘.  You make my Sunday a happy 😊place ❤ya.
Good work guys ! really loved this video
well done guys very Good job see u on Sunday
Koodos on tackling that job. I've done it many times in our houses, in my experience mudding/tapping is the hardest part. It's the fine tuning. The more seams you have the more noticeable it'll be a DIY job. Finding the angle, us carpenters use the sliding bevel guage. Very handy, in expensive tool. Pssssst, sub out the mudding. After my last drywall DIY I vowed never to do it again lol.
I miss Tim
Wasn’t able to send you a message but.... is this you Eamon https://youtu.be/BteDmm9vA-I
So thanks to you guys I tried chai for the first time at Starbucks end it was AMAZING!!!! So I could only imagine y’all’s is even better...but 20 dollars plus shipping is so much and I don’t know how to even make a latte at home 😭😭😭 I just make my own coffee. I stop buying coffee at shops....I was spending $300 a month on coffee and teas 🙃
showed my husband, the contractor, your video and he said, "Go for it. It's the only way you're going to learn."
Seriously! Y’all make hanging drywall fun!! Stupid!! Can’t wait to listen to the podcast. You two rock! 💪😻
Omg, now that I've seen the town, I know exactly where you are! Don't forget to hit Ottawa for a skate on the Canal!
I think you two are remarkable! How are you going to keep the dust down ? Especially when you are living there.
GREAT JOB AS ALWAYS YOU BOTH WORK WELL, THE NEXT STAGE IS VERY MESSY BUT IT WILL LOOK GREAT ONCES YOU CLEAR UP THE MESS, LOOK FORWARD TO NEXT WEEK YOU BOTH CAN DO IT FROM THE UK
Straight up crazy for sure
It can get messy. Pay someone to mud and sand.
Can't wait to see the final transformation, especially that filthy carpet hahaha
You guys would be crazy not to try to do something new so good job on the new look.
Why not ask your deck guy to do it?! He seems pretty capable! If not someone who has local connects of who can do the drywall.
Bob surprisingly younger with a beard!
Go for the mud and tape!!  It will be fun🤔🤓
Crazy hell no - fricking amazing guys, I would hire you both
"Drywaller" must be a profession that only exists on that side of the ocean. In Europe that's considered one of the easy DIY projects. ;-)
We did our own drywall with no experience and having only watched one tutorial. It's not nearly as difficult as people make it seem-though the mudding takes a lot of practice to get seamless it was more important to us to learn how to do it ourselves than it was to have it look perfect and it will save you loads of money. My advice is start slow and build and taper every mud layer-better to need to add another coat then to have too much even though you'll sand it down later. As you're mudding mix the solution with water in little bits at a time since it starts drying as soon as you mix it! You guys can do it!
I wish you knew how fast I went to my podcast app and hit subscribe! Quick! Love you guys! “It’s the great content for me” ;)
Drywall that is poorly installed with  gaps, cracks isn't easily fixed by the tapping and mudding process.  There is a level of art to all things drywall which is a talent I certainly don't have.  I would agree with Trent (Trent and Allie) on this; I might tackle small patch type projects but never again for full room.  It maybe your place today but think about when when/if you sell.
What one man can do so can another. You will figure out how to mud and tape. Just go for it.
Thats so great
How are your shoulders feeling after all that overhead work? Whatever you do...don’t make the mistake of thinking you can do all this again when your older...much harder without the youthful exuberance and young, healthy fit bodies. Currently renovating a very small house comparing to a project almost twenty years ago...things aren’t quite the same!
Missing isn’t bad as long as you match the seams...you can make it really smooth! It isn’t a fun job...but you can get skills if you practice.  That’s awesome you’ll try anything,  you are both young and healthy!
I love the Omaze concept... very cool 😎!
Shouldn’t “pot lights” be “spot lights”! Great job guys
Lol Gilmore Girls was shot at Warner Studios in Burbank, Ca got to work on the show!  I agree Morocco was amazing! Got to go out on camelback 20 miles and stay in Nomads camp!
I know it's late I had to jump back on the channel and say you guys need to make more videos.  I am tired of watching political videos.  Once a week is not enough we need help in the States from you Canadians
Is this vansmith thing really real? Also would they ship to South Africa at all??
Looks good with all the dry wall, but am i the only one who thinks it's a shame to loose the rustic feel with the wood beams etc?
Hanging drywall properly is more important than taping properly.  All of your doors and windows are going to crack and all of the vertical seams that run from floor to ceiling are going to crack. If you want it to still look nice in two years,  redo it all now..... 1. Always hang sheets horizontally,  even short pieces.  2. Always hang a full sheet across the top of a door or window,  then cut it out. 3. Leave a half inch gap at the floor.  4. The smaller the gaps,  the easier it'll be to mud 5. That six inch overhang is no good..... watch videos by "Vancouver carpenter" to learn how to mud.  That guy is a PRO.... You don't know what you're doing,  but neither did I two years ago.  Google before you start a project and you'll be soooo much further ahead..... I agree with your decision still though. Better to try and mess it up than to pay someone else and learn nothing.
Always remember "Measure Twice Cut One" and don't freakout about the mudding and taping.
Do not do the mud and tape, please!
May I suggest U research ARNICA instead of Advil , I have been using it for years now. They have little tiny pills & cream as well. The plant is Arnica Montana 👍🏼 As always U2 work great together. If U get a break check out Sadhguru as well. Been watching many of his vids lately to.
I love y’all. Good job!
You’re not.... okay you guys are crazy but... e&b in for the win on that dry wall - e did way better that I’ve done! Congratulations on another stage done on the El Cabana, my friends! - much love from Oklahoma!    P.S., Eamon, I wish you luck surfing here if you guys ever come. It’s boat after boat with crazy waves! We basically flip our kiddos in tubs on the lake as a rite of passage so 🙋‍♀️😂
That looks awesome guys what a difference white walls make!
Get a stump to put under that trailer tongue when you store it!! lol
makes the room look total different. looks good and bright. just before the housing crash of 2008 i was working for a custom home builder and then the crash happen, the contractor who i was working for got a bid for a small project that the home owner was so proud of that they did not spend any money on sheet rock but saved ever bit they could find for free. If you have seen the meme where it has 100 pieces on one wall ? ya it was awful and the homeowner could not understand why everyone wanted to bid for a tare out and new sheet rock. Needless to say the wall ended up 4 new sheets of dry wall.
Btw, where Eamon keeps throwing his back out is indicative to "degenerative disc disease." I know because I have it in 3 of my lower lumbar discs and always find I'm tweakin' a nerve from torque movements. Mine started when I was 27; Eamon's 30 😏
So, a question; who told you to run your seams sideways? I've always installed my drywall with vertical seams with little to no issue. You just find the stud it ends on and cut at halfway point. Then you continue with the next piece and leave the bottom an inch or so shy all the way around. That gets covered by baseboard. I'm just saying... it ain't rocket science.
Don't use paper tape use the mesh tape . I find it easier
if youre gonna have someone vaccumming behind you with a shop vac as you sand. and whatever you dont want covered in dust put away. that stuff coats everything.
Oh and this makes me happy 😁
I litterly wait every wait every week for these episodes! Yay
You guys rock-tackling these projects! I find myself laughing so much too, at your cute ways, and your banter with each other. Love your videos!!
U MAKE A GREAT DRYWALL TEAM! LOOKS FABULOUS!!
Hey Eamon, put blocks or wood under the tongue of your trailer, so you don’t have to lift it up every time. It will also prevent your coupler mechanism from freezing up. We love your videos! - Rkia & Noah
Duuude probs behind the ball🤓, but who were you guys playing at the beginning of the drywall deconstruction?🙏🎶
YouTube uni..how to mud and tape.
lol ce tem que saber o cateto da hipotenusa.
OMG love that LIfe is Good Store! Love you guys too!
It looks great! Insulate between the interior room walls. Agreed. But it really looks nice 😃
your town looks EXACTLY like Stars Hollow !!!
Take 1: no, don't do it Take 2: no, don't do it Take 3: no, don't do it Take 4: no, don't do it Take 5: no, don't do it Take 6: do it Eamon and Bec: LET'S DO IT
Watch out bec that trailer ganna take yo mans also I subscribed and turned on your post notifications
Fun videos!
A good muddier will do the job in a fraction of the time it’ll take you. It’s easy to do, but hard to do efficiently if you’re not experienced. Expect to do a lot of sanding if you do it yourselves.
Your editing skills are getting better and better each week, all the little details ❤️  I love tuning in 😍 keep on killing it!
The edit and production of these vlogs are just getting better and better! Suport from Pt 🇵🇹
Why wouldn't you just hang wooden planks? It would look much better(more of a cozy look) and would be much easier
15:10 no backer on box around pipe. Sheetrock needs backers at corners. Love it Keep it up!!!
When will trinity be back
As somebody who's done a fair little bit of trailer driving I'm low key impressed with the trailer backup at 7:45. Well played sir 👏🏻
I did some successful taping/mudding drywall at age 18/19, once you get the hang of I,t it's not hard! the sanding takes a long time but never leave behind a little hole bec it WILL bother you once painted. Super enjoying your vids, love from an American in Luxembourg.
They told us not to do THIS?! You won't BELIEVE number 7!! 😱
We tried mudding & taping recently and ME, the crafty one did a horrible job and ended up crying in frustration. My boyfriend, who is NOT handy fixed it. lol
As a painter, who has done a WHOLE lot of unqualified drywalling in my career, I can assure you it's not as bad as everyone is making it out to be. Just super messy, but you guys love getting your hands dirty so you will be JUST FINE!
Are you guys vegan? Love your content btw 😽💕
Very cool project we would love to have a cabin 😁
Insulate all walls interior, exterior & ceilings. Always!!!  Great video
This is @justkensie’s mom. If this old lady can dry wall, I know you two can do it!  It totally sucks, but if you can build a van out..., you will conquer the drywall!
watching someone mud drywall is just as horrible, don't do it.
YES reroot is back :)
At first I thought a whole renovation would be difficult to do, which I’m sure it is but it seems totally doable now that I’ve been watching you two do it! Looks great 👍
I remember when I first subscribed to you guys 2 and half years ago and still my favorite channel 💯💪🏽❤️
Is the van giveaway US only? :)
Missing and taping aren’t too bad. I just hated sanding
Get you a cinderblock to go under that trailer tongue, make your life easier! Great job on the drywall! You guys can do your own mudding. Just go with thin coats. May have to do it more than once but makes sanding so much easier and will look good in the end. Y'all rock.
Love watching your videos!! ♥️ I’m always excited to learn more and see what new things you guys tackle! Question for Bec, where did you get your neck warmer??
Awesome job, you two👍
I read so many comments about putting soundprood material between your drywall.  Is it possible to take some sheets down, put the soundproof material between and put the drywall back up?  At least it's already measured.  Write matching numbers on the drywall and the studs so you can put the sheets back exactly where they were.  I know nothing about building but anyway I think that is what I would do before moving on.
Trent! Love that you guys are in touch, even if just for this vid.
I’d LOVE a van... do you ship to South Africa???
75% of heat loses in a house are through the ceiling.best double the insulation here
That intro. 👙😎❄️🤣
I just finished hanging and taping drywall in  an entire house. I watched  2 Canadian you tubers and had no issues. Vancouver carpenter and home renovision. Highly recommend them. FYI, I turn 60 this year. If I can do it you can. Taping is easy if you follow them, I only sand on the last coat to minimize dust. I did buy a chesp drywall lift, highly recommended for ceiling. Get the bags of 90 minute mix for the first coats. Only mix half a bag. Don't try to be perfect on first coats. Don't sand till end, just knock off high spots with drywall blade. Soak your tape in water to prevent bubbles. Final coat use pre mix and a keep a spray bottle of water handy  in case it dries out on you.
Insulate now will be glad you did in the future, also should not be breaking your sheet rock (dry wall) on the same joint will make finishing tougher. God Bless
You will find that it is best to put up the largest size piece of drywall you can. Try to have only one horizontal mud line and NO verticlel lines except corners . Every INCH of less mudding will save so much time     CHEERS    Steve h.
Drywall's not so tough, we've done it ourselves!   The mudding & taping smoothly is the bigger challenge...but totally doable.  You guys are handy, you'll be fine through any of these projects!  Just watch lots of youtube vid's to get tips/tricks & important "must/must not do" type info (like insulating interior walls/ceilings!) --- you guys rock, love watching you tackle these projects fearlessly :)
Do you think you could be vegan while backpacking through south east asia? Personally I found it hard even being vegetarian in south america...
Bec's cheerful energy is contagious... she can even make doing drywall seem so fun...much love to you guys I look forward to your videos every week.
With Eamon and Bec it's always about great storytelling, even when the story itself might seem not worth telling. Making a dull subject fascinating to watch is what makes them  so engaging!
I grew up with a father who did carpentry. Drywalling isn't that difficult... Perhaps my dad made it easier?
If you're at all picky about the finish of your walls (after painting), hire a pro to do the mud/tape. It's really worth it!
The worst part is yet to come --- taping/mudding --- no joke!  But, it wouldn't be a home reno if you aren't doing it yourselves :-)  Expect some mini-meltdowns....
So since you use the trailer regularly... i found a trick that if you put the trailor in the same spot everytime and mark it then put flags where the hitch is at you can back without struggling everytime in and out to find you hitch... i do the same and works like a gem!
Could you guys do a house tour whenever this masterpiece is completed
Great video and couple makes me smile
The trailer scene... pure gold! 😂
Wow a lot of van lifers have $$ 2 buy homes.  Strange
2 Side notes 1) You both look very relaxed, good to show being comfortable in "wild" build area to allow play with work 2) Can skip this opinion as home nest is very personal   but look at slowing down by avoiding common materials and go with more traditional older techniques. Allows more meditation like art so can uncover things needed for better work and life quality for health.  Maybe for future material option invest in a bio crop that reduces global warming. Used in buildings, hremp will continue to absorb carbon dioxide. Believe gypsum drywall can mildew. Usually has chemicals that reduce that damage but can get inhaled by workers. People can get cancer from chronic exposure. So drywall is especially not good for future remodels imo, requires dust free vacuum methods..  Liked these videos for future house build focused on a non drug variety of hemp:  8:37 video length Plastering with Hemp by The Natural Building Centre https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDa_ZiB91ek&t=6s lighter than other natural plaster, goes on fast  14:54 video length A Stunning Small Home Made from Hemp by Living Big in a Tiny House https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gg17npoP0uk  For me would like to research imo "healthy" hemp as sustainable crop for use in a finish or insulation to house diy and continue farming it for long lasting clothes fiber. Hemp is oldest textile found in archaeology.. .maybe why acts small to mind. Can also control aluminum dyeing process that is used in most clothes and have a homestead self work industry. . .at a manageable scale.
THIN COATS, don't rush it, it goes faster and easier, slow and thin
you two are CRAZY GOOD!
You CAN do it!!
Misaphonia issues with you eating that soup dude 🍵🙉🤫😂 ...well done on the cabin guys
drywall fun, been there, done that.  Hanging the stuff isn't to bad, a pain sometimes, especially when you don't have one of those angle finder things :), but the mudding. that's a different animal all together.  The drywall I did was in an old house so the walls weren't exactly straight.  It's amazing what a good mud job can do to fix all those wiggle's in the drywall.  So yea, hang it if you want to have some fun, but pay to have it mudded.  My two cents :)
Where in Ontario are you guys at?
I was a drywaller for more than 40 years. Get yourself a back brace with lumbar support. For any kind of lifting and working. You will thank me in the end.
Love the coat Bec!!
I’m so stoked for Reroot to be back!!!!
I say mud and tape it yourself. It’s not hard just a bit time consuming. Good luck can’t wait to see your next video!
Guys check out Life Uncontained here on YT. They're just starting drywall too.
You can do it! I did it with no experience and it came out fine.
Thanks for the tour lol 😆
Do the tapping easy. Can do plastering ive tried it but is just quicker and easier to get someone in. You can then get on with abother project. You could labour for the pro and save money.
yall got past the hard part the tape and mud is easy... you can always fix it with your sanding block later!! just make sure it dries long enough!!! lol i have faith in you guys you got anything you can put your mind to <3 dont ever stop you guys are the best
Nice work guys, thanks for sharin.... 👍👍
Why do you install loads of lights when one main is sufficient side lamps are a must.?
Seriously i miss BOB ! Hope to see him soon ♥
Dry wall... What you can drywall no problem.
Hi Eamon and Bec, I have been following you guys for several years with response, but this video is so close to home. Drywall, this video reminds me of working with my parents in NY. Eamon no worries,  my dad's back also would hurt afterwards as well.  I am proud of your fearlessness to try everything at least once.
When you say "yaaa" or "jaa" that's actually yes in Norwegian, "ja". And we say it too when we're satisfied with doing a job!
You guys are incredible!
Hi Eamon and Bec  love your youtube. Your doing a great job on your cabin. lots of work  thank you England
Check out the YouTube channel."Dad How Do I" for your drywall project.
Been a drywall finisher since 1985, the hardest part for a novice is the ceilings, you guys don't have to worry about that so you are good to go. But if I were you instead of tape and mud, I go with American clay product a much environment friendly ( no toxic fumes ) and way easier to do, no sanding need it and even better looking anyway just my two cents. Good luck
Sound proof your interior walls. I regret not having done that in our home especially between the kitchen and master bedroom. The fridge is really loud.
Who watches these abysmal click bait title videos???
You guys should tape, an cover screws& holes, I would get someone to block an skim. Trust me, way less headaches (plural) .
Hi just wondering and hoping if the omaze comp is open for international subscriber's? I am in Australia I hope so! As I just find myself and my daughter without a home as our family farm has been sold by my brother after I have just spent the last five years nursing my mother immediately after my father had passed in 2015. It's been such a rotten time not just for us but for so many people all over the world, what a great comp, here's hoping and a huge thanks to you both, your content and channel brighten my day, allows me to relax and escape. Thanks x
It’s beans beans good for your heart the more you eat the more you fart 💨 haha😜
You both are sensational
I'm not a builder but I thought to help keep the heat in and or cool to stay in you put in insulation.??  Am I wrong ? There is the space between the inside wall and the outside of the wall and you put in like rolls of insulation. Wouldn't that be of help for you guys?  Just askin.✌
Nerds are always right.
... I admire any one who isn't afraid to take on the  DIY challenge's you two are doing.   ...  We hired out the Dry wall in two houses we built.  I think you can do it just fine, but its hard on the back kiddo's.
🧻🚽📐📉✏️👷‍♂️👷‍♀️👍...
You guy's are awesome. Love your attitudes about this project. You can learn how to do everything on youtube so just look up how to mud and tape dry wall. It can't be that hard.
Being an actual nerd for a living, I can tell you that Eamons way of measuring the triangle should absolutely have worked the way he described it. Probably one of the measurements was wrong :D
Lookin good!!!! 😊
Your better keeper around because she knows angles it's simple geometry if you know the pitch and the rise in very high butYour better keeper around because she knows angles it's simple geometry if you know the pitch and the rise
We plastered our bathroom And hallway with no experience - there are some good YouTube videos on it and once you get in the motion it’s all good - and anything terrible you sand away anyway 👍🏽
Watch Mr. Build it
Hahahahaha i love the effort. If you’ve measured both sides correctly, you don’t need a protractor.
Always have wood blocks for the trailer;)
What no insulation ....???
I would love to know what coffee you folks use on that breville, and are you making espressos or Americanos with it?
Go for it. Looking good 👍
Thank you for uploading this beautiful video once again and now we will see it together with friends in the office, and in your video there is love, you love each other, you have any plans for the baby don't get angry just ask. Special greetings from Afghanistan :)
My husband and I have been remodeling the master bath in our 95 year old home. LET ME TELL YOU! This has been an adventure. When we started this "adventure" the bathroom didn't have insulation or drywall up. What we had was grocery store plastic bags stuffed here and there as some kind of insulation. To hold that in the previous owner had screwed in fabric and fake leather on the walls. The subfloor consisted of 47 year old plywood and newspaper from 1973. It was interesting to say the least. Oh, the floor wasn't level and NOTHING in that bathroom is straight. During this whole thing my husband, my stepkids, and myself have been redoing the plumbing, electrical, drywalled, mudded, put new floors in, painting and staining. We are FINALLY onto the walk-in shower portion, but wait my husband wants to change out the ceiling we put in. Soooo we have to do that before we can put the tile on the shower walls. I'll be so glad when this whole thing is over. Basically, what I'm saying is yes you're crazy for doing it yourselves, but y'all aren't alone.
You guys should totally do a murphy bed in your guest bedroom! That way it can also side a functional office! You could even make drop down desks that are supported by an upside L so the desks would almost blend with the wall when not in use!
You know.....I kind of miss Tim......
We just did our basement playroom. We hired someone for our mainfloor in our townhouse. For our current home my husband researched and found Vancouver carpenter. Made a huge difference having the right tools and tips. Its not as intimidating for the rest of our projects we got lined up. Here I am the wife who doesn't do it saying this. I just help hanging the drywall and carrying stuff.
Hey Eamon and Bec! During Covid I've been spending time with my dad renovating his basement and we're doing drywall right now too. He wanted to share his mudding tip with you guys so we made a little video with some tips.  https://youtu.be/IPl-Oy1NS1w
it was a right triangle... 90 degree angle ...
Might have wanted some insulation in the roof
You guys got boring AF
I can't believe Trent said he's going to hire someone... My father did drywall... It's really only difficult if you want perfectly smooth walls... Textured walls give you some grace
Oh my oh my where you guys have gone.  I just viewed your "Someone Broke Into Our Home" video. And Bec at 7:10, classic.   So sorry you went through that!  Been following for a long while now, best of the best, keep up the great work!   Love your place up in the sticks!  You are amazing!!  Cheers from Sauga!
It's best to hang dry wall vertically so you have less cuts, and than you can hide any waviness with trim
Grew up in that little town and still love to go back! Recognized the drone footage of the lake on your way there.
need to get a dremel!!
get a dimpler to put the screws in, makes it a bit easer
you are fucking hilarious
Amazing back up job with that trailer.  You make it look easy.
Beans, beans, the magical fruit. The more you eat, the more you toot. So save a nickel and buy a can and you can be a musical man.
Please put in some Mossa content next video and also thank you so much for the longer format 🤞🤗🤗

Who runs the world? Nerds. Who got it wrong? Buddy. 🤣🤣🤣🤣
I love your bed sheets. Where did you get them from?
I am sure there are some dry wall experts there in Westport.
Eamon, you and that trailer made me bust a gut.Been there done that.You'll be an expert before you know it..
Mudding and taping isn't hard, just tedious.
No insulation???
Guys why aren’t you putting in the insulation in between the floors it’s going to echo really loud? We’re not putting any insulation you’ve turned your floors into drums
Drywall is more cumbersome than “difficult” electrical is problematic, prone to fire if you do it wrong or plumbing that floods the house if done wrong.  Long story short drywall is easy watch about six videos of drywall professionals and you’ll get the jest.
go heavy with tape and mud then sand at least 3 times/layers
had the walls been square then eamons trick would have worked.
Mudd and tape is messy, wait until the spring so you can do it with the windows open and blow the dust out
Ughhhh what I would do to win that van 😍😍😍 made my donation!! 🤞🏼
Hi there... i was just thinking that you could have made master bedroom more bigger by joining with guest room... i dnt know if that’s possible... i got no talent in building homes... just felt like sharing my thoughts, which doesn’t matter to you off course... but love watching you guys remodeling 👍🏻
Yeah, mudding is super easy. You'll be fine, you just have a lot to do and it makes a ton of dust when you sand.
Oh gosh... you are into the mud and the dust minus the glory now! Go forth! I am sure you two can do anything. Expecting to see a coupla gost like  white faces after a round of sanding. Hahah had to give it a go myself.  One day you two will be telling someone else not to do it!  It is just super messy is all. You've got a big ole lake full of water to mop the dust up with.
The secret to mud & tape... wet the tape, use 5" knife for first coat of mud.... don't worry about gaps/divots/holes, they'll fill in later... use 8" knife blade for coats 2 & 3/skim coat... smooth as you go... wait for it to dry a little then knock down any ridges to save on sanding.
Beans, beans are good for your heart. The more you eat, the more you fart. The more you fart, the better you feel. So eat your beans at every meal. Lol
Yup, they told ya not to do it.  Dry wall can be a bitch.  Good luck with that.
You guys are amazing!
I'm sure you can do the mud and tape, and I'm sure it will be a pain in the booty.  Another opportunity for "how it started, how it's going"  I've only done a little, but I believe that when it comes to sanding, bee sure to close off the room you're sanding, so you don't get dust EVERYWHERE. :)
site doesnt work
Watching you guys eat delicious, healthy vegan meals then an ad comes on for macdonalds and it’s a person slow-mo eating a big meaty Big Mac...
I personally hate the mudding and sanding part of drywalling. I agree with other suggestions to start with inconspicuous areas first to get practice at how thin you can get the mud to avoid wasting time on sanding. If you do decide to do it yourselves, you’ll kill it just like you do everything- you’ll have fun, make mistakes, and learn and ultimately it will look amazing!!!
also if you tear off any of the white paper be sure to prime the "scar"  with a sealer like Zinsser Bin (shellac) or  Zinsser123 or Zinsser Gardz (order on amazon) to seal it before you mud. Else it will not look right forever.
Hi There you are so funny and fun to watch. I did do mud myself in a washroom reno. I would say one tip that help was to wet the dry wall tape. When the tape is wet the mud stick to it better. That would be one of my take.
#27 on trending !!!! So proud of you guys !   Sending my love 💕✨
Don't forget to attach your trailer chains, it''ll keep your hillbilly rig from flying into oncoming traffic.
Drywall is easy. To Screw Up.  But watch "Vancouver Carpenter" channel.  He covers most everything.  with Drywall.
💪🏾
The editing and cinematography is so on point!!!
haha love lee, she's so right if anyone can you guys can!
Dry wall is ez, unless your lazy.  Sounds like those people r lazy.  Mud in several thin layers to reduce sanding as much as possible.  And start at the bottom first!  The next one up can then just lay on the edge of the one below.
who else waiting for the closeup ASMR when they mud? "Click, click, click, click, click" But legit buds, kudos for DIYing it all. can't learn until you try.
Hey Guys when you go to start to Mud and Tape,Keep in mind "Thin is in " You may have to do a few more coats,But you'll have a much easier time Sanding, Good Luck<Can't wait to see the Finish. agreed!
were is the dog ??
How many of you feel nose itching when you see dust flying ?
Personnaly IHATE SANDING!!  how will you live and breath in that space with all that DUST in your nostrils dudes?? BTW good job!
You guys are great! I love your laugh bec, it is so cute! sounds like me lmao
You're proving you can do anything you put your mind to.
FYI Somehow I was unsubscribed. 😡
A wide 12 knife, pre mixed mud, and mesh tape with sticky back. You can DO IT . 👍👍🍹
Go to Mexico? lol The US-Mexico border has been closed since March 2020? You can fly, but only essential business can cross, at least until February 28.   ...and low empathy is a sign of a narcissistic pathology, so...maybe more compassion and kindness toward one another? Easier said than done when remodeling a home yourself. lol  I respect you for taking this on yourselves. I wouldn't even attempt it. lol Stay safe and sane.
YOU GUYS DID AMAZING!!!!
Relaxation - YouTube
im a plaster and dont do it your self im telling u , its very tuchy, need alot of dexterity ! i know Eamon your good with pretty everything but that ... hope u the best because anyway you gon do your way so ill see you next sunday
Drywall and mudding isn't that bad. Don't let them psyche you out!^^
Do you ever fight?
Great job with the drywall! That is the easy part. Tapping is pretty easy too but getting the 'mudding' right, I would hire a pro for that. Every mistake is visible unless you use a the right kind of tools and then the right texture on the wall before painting. It is so time consuming learning to get it right. A professional gets it done fast and correctly 'mudded' the first time. Just speaking from lots of experience as some of your other comments say:-)
Awesome job! You guys are an inspiration!
What a beautiful town, very whimsical. We  also have been in lockdown since 26th December in Northern Ireland. Nothing is open but essential food stores, post office, Chemist and Doctors and hospitals.  I know I am feeling a bit fed up at times, thanks for all your Vlogs they make me smile.
You should get rid of the guest bedroom and make a large master! The guest can sleep in the loft
Eamon, where can I find those glasses at 1:32 ?
You guys are on Trending ✌🏽
Also should use fiber tape it's easier to use than paper tape.
Make sure all the screws are sunk in and not sticking out. Do a first coat of mudding over the taping thin so the sanding is minimal and then a thicker coat to blend it.
Omg #30 on trending!!
Get Tim to help you with the mudding. He seems like he would be good at that!
Omaze is a scam why do you not research what you promote. Check out trustpilot over 80% say it’s a scam. I’m considering not following you anymore because of this.
When you're mudding, put less on and do more coats rather than telling yourself you'll sand it out.  Wet the tape before you apply it. Fan your joints out at least a foot or like 16 inches.  I use an inside corner trowel because I'm not a pro, but I've still mudded about 3 houses.  It is not the easiest, but it's a nice skill to master.  I'm pretty good now, but it took a bit.  Depends how perfect you want it.  You got it.
It's all in the wrist with mudding.  Watch tutorials or pro's, believe it or TicToc is loaded with them...the most missed thing is the constancy when mudding. check that out
I love everything you guy's have done to the cabin so far but I was wondering if you're going to replace the front door.
Always take a lady seriously when she knows her protractor! Good job y'all!!
You can do it, no problem! I've done small jobs myself. As much as you've done already, I have complete confidence in you!
eamons gray beard patch is coming along strong
That's the same Omaze winner as the one from GoneWithTheWins channel...
Regarding your podcast my small dog walking business has decreased by 80%! Because of our lockdown... Downtown Toronto! 🇨🇦I’m trying to building up my YouTube audience slowly maybe make some money that way :)
👏
Me today* Eamon and Bec should befriend Kara and Nate!!! Me listening to your podcast today.. Eamon... our friends Kara and Nate... NO WAY!!!! Collab one day!!! :)
All I can think of is...the dust...when you start sanding all those walls!  ... it’s everywhere and gets into everything...cover your kitchen appliances...close your bedroom door!  It’s the only part I hate of home renos.
Wow that looks really nice!
For 1st timers putting up drywall, you did a fantastic job.  Taping and mudding are a bit harder but if you take your, time you'll be okay.  IMO, the trick is doing 3 coats and each one gets a bit wider than the previous coat as you are filling in that dip between sheets of drywall......You two can do it I'm sure.  Sanding can get a bit messy and I like to wet sand....actually damp....but that may not be the best way.  Just take your time and don't worry about perfection.  Can't wait to see how it all turns out and what colors you choose for each room.  Best of luck.
Good job!
I was 26 when we bought our first house. We tackle just about everything ourselves. Drywall and mudding is about patience and learning when you should stop! A few tips: 1. Install drywall vertical, not horizontal. There are special divets on the long sides of the drywall sheets to help you mud. If you install vertical then you should only have two drywall sheets touching for the most part. If you install horizontal then you can have 4 sheets touching and those divets end up running along the ceiling or along the floor! 2. I prefer the netted drywall tape because it's sticky and someone can tape while another starts mudding. 3. When it comes to mudding, less is best. I still need to remind myself of this after 7 years! GOODLUCK! Can't wait to see your progress next week ❤❤❤
No sugar coating, but what you need to read.....A few things amateurs are clueless about..... NEVER have a 4 way intersection. T intersections are better. Especially when taping and spackling (USA language). Stagger the boards so no 4 way seams happen.  (Saw you did 4 ways every opportunity). Always try to lay the 4x8 sheets across the studs, and the more studs, the more stable. Put the sheet against the ceiling first and press it up so it touches the ceiling. Level is the only thing you can trust. Use it. DON"T screw the screw heads so deep they rip the paper. This eventually will let the sheetrock pull from the studs from daily vibrations over the years.. Dimpling the screws and/or nail heads gives the spackle more surface area to adhere to and remain stable longer. If you have never spackled from start to finish, you will be sorry after you paint and see how bad you did. Getting it done properly is an art that comes from experience. Floating and working with different sized knives to perfection doesn't happen for a long time. Nor does polishing! Do it right.... Pay the price. Or the price you wind up paying will be painful. Sometimes Luck comes from educated decisions, rather than over confidence that hasn't been earned. Hope this makes sense and helps! And pad out headers that sit too low rather than cutting the studs around them. DOH.
1. Love to see you guys having fun. Quality video! 2. Drywall sheets are super easy! 3. What you guys call 'mudding' and we in UK call plastering or skimming is super difficult and a real skill! Once you've done the WHOLE place you'll have learnt how. PAY SOMEONE! (I didn't 😁)
WHEN I HEARD YALL ON THE MICS I DIED. I have missed reroot so much and was just thinking how badly i need a new podcast.... I am so pumped!
Looks FANTASTIC!  You can hide any minor imperfections later with an application of 50/50 wallpaper glue  and water with a small roller  It gives the smallest texture to throw off the eye.  You can do it!!❤️❤️❤️
You guys totally got this!!
New subscriber -  binging Eamon & Bec has been great during lockdown! Love following your remodeling progress.  Question: Bec, what brand is your sunglasses ? I've been wondering since Morocco. See you next Sunday ;)
Wish your blogs were Longer 😭 they go to fast 25 mins is not long enough Love you thou 😘😂
When hanging sheetrock horizontally which I recommend you need to stagger your seams.  Like you do flooring
I just fell in love with you guys.... at " welcome to our sleepy hollow"  haha home hardware for the win! I resonate because I'm building right now as well!  and also in a small snowy town in BC! (however I am coming back to Toronto in a few weeks!
Eamon, use a chunk of wood to put your trailer tongue up off the ground😎
why are the two of you so cute
love the intro. The snow is so pretty.  Then sipping on sunshine comes on at  1:01 - 1:18 😊 love this song. Posted it on my channel. https://youtu.be/wKXf2HDo-xQ You just go a New subscriber. I can't wait to binge watch ur videos over the weekend
Tips: use a drywall banjo for taping and do a skip trowel finish for texture.I've done this method before and I'm not a pro... hides a lot of mistakes, is easy to match if you have to make repairs, and looks awesome 👍https://youtu.be/gW2w8hzLn8k
Taping is pretty easy. The secret is not to skimp on the mud. Make the joints wide so you have plenty of room to "feather" the joints. Pro mesh can be stronger than paper tape and a bit neater to apply. The smoother the application the less you have to sand. Apply multiple coats and invest in the proper tools. Don't use some old putty knives you have lying around. Sanding (dust) is the worst part and get a sanding pole.
Oh my goodness...Eamon!...thank you for showing the world that we guys can take like 4+ attempts to get the trailer hitch distance to the trailer right!...It's a thing Bro and you are not alone...:)
Can someone tell me what is the name of the song at 1.07, thanks much
A sprinkle of nerd + a dash of add/ocd + a little lunch = the next home renovation show for HGTV folks ... go for the taping & muddin !!! You guys do all the research necessary for everything else anyways - this is just the next thing to learn 🔥
That ladder is AWESOME!! What’s the brand and name of it?
Guess who's back? BACK AGAIN! Reroot's back. Tell a friend! Season 2 of our podcast launched this morning and we would be so grateful if you'd give it a download, a listen and a review. Thank you for all of your continued love and support x Apple Podcasts: https://apple.co/39Df2qI Spotify: https://spoti.fi/3jecsdS + AVAILABLE ANYWHERE YOU GET YOUR PODCASTS 💜 .
When you are taping and mudding remember... Thin is the idea when mudding and as flat as possible.  You have to sand in between the mudding and should be done in 3 coats, with sanding in between the coats. hope this is helpful!! Cheers.
If your tape and mud looks bad just speckle your walls and you won't even see it.
That guest room looks great! When can I visit? Lol
I swear the guy who won the van also won one on another channel? Is one competition for every video amaze sponsors?
You will do a Phenomenal job!!! But,  I suggest you finish the dry wall in all rooms first then tape. Its going to look AMAZING!!! Praying for ya'll!! <3
If I may suggest  , that u look into fire rate drywall or concrete  board to go behind your wood burning fireplace, for safely  reason and possible home insurance  issues . 🤔 I hope u don't mind me mentioning  it.🙂
Tape it and mud it yourself Eamon.  Take your time.  Yes, it will take more revisits than the pros to fix all the imperfections.  It's a cottage, you guys have got this.  I would suggest you do NOT use the dust control joint compound, it dries very hard and is tough to sand down if you make a mistake.
Your videos are honestly the highlight of my week! I love seeing this new place come together and it’s such an beauuutifuulll place to live! Being in the miserable uk (covid and weather) is made a lot more bearable with the escapism you guys provide! Thank you thank you thank you
Was so cool to see Trent lol! and you are crazy hire a mudder!!!!
Love every minute of your show each week! 🙏💕
A friend is looking for property in the kingston area..she is extremely jealous of yours and is looking for a nice chunk of land. Any real estate agents you could suggest?
I kept feeling like a missed a cabin tour somewhere. This little walkthrough was super helpful. I would love to see a more detailed tour of the place with like explanations of what you envision for each room.
Insulation!  When you renovate your bathrooms, and kitchen wet areas, you may want to consider using heavier waterproof wallboard.
lol you idiots clearly didnt get any information on how to drywall. all your boards are fucked and your tape and mud will crack within a year. you didnt stagger boards and line bevels up. im sure your mud and tape is an even more hack job
Good on you guys. You couldn't pay me to drywall. I've done it only once and I'll never do it again.
Had me snacks ready but no video then I found this one       This video pleases the pp *highly recommend*
Make sure you guys look into some sort of soundproofing for behind your drywall! My wife and I used Rockwool Safe n' Sound, and that stuff is magical.
Better not tell people from B.C. to go to Mexico. They will have to get tested coming home, quarantine, and pay a $2,000. fine. We’re being told by the government not to travel (so maybe edit or cut that part out?) Just a thought. Love you guys!
Wonderful video and excellent work on the cabin guys!: ps your editing is next-level good
Loved the four-pane shots and synchronized music! Also, Pythagorean theorem FTW.
I actually enjoyed the mudding part of drywall. The cutting and hanging was nooooooot my fave.  I say good for you and go for it! Everybody's gotta start somewhere right? ;)
Man I'd love to get myself a van...I've been really considering vanlife, to the point I'm  working on an actual design. Taking into careful consideration what me and my dog would need... I know vanlife isn't all rainbows and sunshine but I know this is something both me and my dog need. She'd love the adventure and freedom, and I'd actually get to live a much "simpler" and happy life... I've never been happy living the way  one is "suppose to". Congrats on everything you guys have done. The cabin is going to be absolutely stunning when you're done
workout in those shoes ? i think they stink because you are married to them .
Mudding and taping are fine. It’s sanding the mud that is the real battle. It will be EVERYWHERE
Very easy-to-use put thin layer of plaster when you put the tape on and walk way move to the next siem don't play with it you get the hang of it.
You doing good good job
Thats ok eamon and bec next time you need help hanging sheet rock you let me know ok guys
Is it just me, or does Eamon give off Jim Carrey vibes sometimes (intended as the best compliment ever)
You should watch Uncontained!!! There currently doing that!!! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5L80nwg7bo
For lower back pain get in child’s pose and do core work (planks) not crunches
Mudding and taping drywall is not at all difficult. Watch a couple of DIY shows or videos and you're golden.
I love you guys 😭 such peaceful vibes
I always look forward to the inspiring & oh so hilarious videos each week!  🧡 See you Sunday!!   p.s. I call my husband buddy now 🤣 thanks
Take it from the painter; not even drywallers who do that for a living can do it right. I ended up covering almost the whole wall with putty.
Mudding and taping isn't terribly difficult, its just really easy to make it look bad and the time spent on it as a beginner to look good may not be worth it compared to the speed and skill of a professional. My parents have remodeld houses for over 20 years and have done sheetrock in almost every house, but anything bigger than a patch job we have a professional do our mudding and taping for smooth walls.
The trick to mud and tape is to have patience, don’t look to close and lay down some thick texture. That worked for me 😁
do 4 thin coats rather than 2 heavy coats of mud
I watch this channel called "Life Uncontained". They make the dry wall installation look easy. Maybe you should hit them up! :)
Funnily enough, the Gilmore Girls pilot was filmed in Ontario (Unionville). The set was partially based on that town
Mud and tape isn't very hard, feathering and making it look good can be tricky. DO NOT USE 90MINUTE MUD OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT!!!! get a 5 gallon bucket of regular drywall mud and a mixer for you're drill. you can always save your leftover mud by leveling it out in the bucket and covering it with an inch or two with water. put more mud on than you think you need. you can always do extra sanding to make everything smooth!!
They're better at video making than building
I’ve never commented on a video before, normally I’m just a silent viewer😅 Buttttttt I wanted to comment today. Recently I’ve been going through a pretty intense wave of anxiety, and though YouTube is normally my preferred method of viewing content, lately a lot of my favorite channels have been a little triggering for me. Then there’s you guys. I always look forward to your videos because I know they have a calming effect on me. Thank you for continuing to release light hearted and relaxing content even though the world we’re living in today is anything but. I appreciate you both so much.♥️
That song that you used when you was going to post office what’s it called lol. I want to use the same one for one of my videos. Cheers guys loving the snow out there am from uk and the only snow we get is enough to fill a bucket. Cheers guys
They are living my dream life
"hi Bec, it's me Taylor:)"
Beans beans, they’re good for your heart The more you eat, the more you fart The more you fart, the more you eat The more you sit on the toilet seat!
im impressed.
you need a front lift on that trailer hahaha
My husband and I have done dry wall many times. the mudding part is like frosting a cake; it's all in the wrist. One thing I learned last time though is that the mud is toxic to breathe in, hour after hour. Made myself sick for a day doing this in the cold last winter, so open the windows!
at 15:27 did anyone else look around to see what was making the Beeeeeep? lol
At time stamp 16:57 Amin’s Phone read 2:22 if you’re reading this pause at that time and make a wish it still counts ☺️
Mudding and Taping is not easy, but it’s not difficult either. Too much mud and you’ll be sanding for days. Too little mud and you’ll have to add another coat and let it dry and hold you back. Watch some videos by Mike Holmes to get some hints. The drywall looks great. Way to go!
My parents have pulled a Trent and alley and built their own home (but it’s a biggie) and they’ve done pretty much everything but the foundation and metal roof. They’ve done all the drywall, tape and mud and they are 62 and 64 and my dad had a triple bypass surgery 5 months before they started building! They are close to being done with the whole house a year in. If they can do it you all can! (Ps my mom worked for the school district and my dad was a pipe layer before retirement so neither had a lot of construction experience)
Eamon!! Go get a hair cut pleeeaase! Hahaha
hints to mud and tape; cut away any raised flags of paper from the sheets, don't use fiberglass tape for the corners use paper, do buy the corner trowel for the inside corners 2", 6" 12" knives for the rest. Use corner mold for the outside corners, don't worry about corners and edges that are covered with trim. mudding is not about flat it about smooth (within reason) seams take at least 3 coats 1- fill crack and stick tape on smoothly 3" wide +/-(tape doesn't need to be a continuous piece one end to the other) 2- cover tape 4"-6" wide, 3- smooth skim coat 10"-14" wide, repeat #3 if required. Sand only enough to take the edges off the previous coats, successive coats cover the edges and fill the holes, the smoother you get with the knife the less sanding you need to do but don't over work the mud. And clean up tools regularly don't return mud to the pail small bits of dried mud will make smooth mudding imposable when you see lines in your smoothing stroke stop an clear the knife chunks in the mud will make the edge of your knife work like a rake. Clean up sanding dust right away wipe it from the wall as well it will mix with new mud and make chunks ^ and will spread and dirty everything it is much like mood dust of the desert it will get everywhere. Wear a N95 mask for sanding and clean up. Vacuum only with a hepa filter it will just blow the finest particles everywhere if you don't.  It takes patience and perseverance this is 80% skill 15% art, 2% black magic and 3% divine intervention. Good luck it mostly takes practice.
You're flat out crazy but it'll be a learning experience!
In UK we tape and mud, then skim the whole sheet so there’s no sanding. Once dry you apply and ova glue and water mix to seal the finishing plaster.
Welcome to small town life 😜🥰
Awesome job, dunno what the problem is everyone saying don't do it-sticking up the sheets is a breeze it's the plastering that's a complete dog. Eamon go dude
Yey 🤓 nerds🙌🙌🙌🤣
You guy are my buddies I just love you two
You all need a break, DO NOT tape and mud yourself!!! Get a pro!! Please please.
We did all the drywalling in our bathroom reno and yeah, there were mishaps but totally worth it! You guys are doing an awesome job! Deff continue!
Good job
No go for it, you will pick it up Like everything else you do will be a great job
Yassss! So glad you did it yourselves!!!!! Looks so good!
I’m with Lee. You should go for it.  I’d say just practice in areas that are less visible. Otherwise, how is anyone supposed to get good at mud and tape if they don’t try it themselves at some point?
If you can dry wall in which yall clearly can then you can tape and mud. Mind over matter. Yall got this.
Just purchased an item from your advertisers. Keep up the good work guys!
Hahahahahaha the trailer part had me dying 😂😂😂😂 I just love you guys so much hahHaha
Love the new glasses, Eamon. Your transformation into Bob is almost complete.
Hey guys. Just caught a glimpse of the lintel above the window in the guest room and it looks like you have or had woodworm. Might wanna check that out.
I've taped and mudded before, it was awful. So if you can afford to hire someone, I'd hire someone. But if not or if you just want to do it yourself, go for it!!!  It can be done, it's just a lot of work and a lot of clean up
Y'all are doing a good job but the hardest part is tape and mudding. Them cracks along the ceilings you can cover with trim. Y'all work so good together . Love y'all's channel.  God speed
Eamon gets passed food... Skip, Eamon gets passed more food... Skip  Life is so much better not listening to him eating 😂
its looking great the only thing sad about this that we have to wait until next sunday for more 🥺 something to look forward to ! 😍
" Ειιιι dry wall all day "  🙌🙌🙌🌊🏄‍♀️🙌🙌🙌  I was this van too , can I?
19:47 "you're a nerd" 😂😂
https://youtu.be/K7NV-Jkvjok
So smart she look good and he films her and they get paid. Should buy a trailer tongue jack for the utility trailer.
Dewalt makes a bit called a Sheetrock driver bit   Every screw is set with a small dimple for finishing. Works great! Saves the over and under you get with a straight bit. You also want to stager the vertical lines of the Sheetrock joints
anyone know the song at 6:00
Hire it
You make it seem fun!
Should definitely get some help on mudding and taping. That's the most tedious and tiring part. My husband is a contractor and he said he wouldn't mind coming up to help you guys in exchange for ice fishing on the lake 😜
Drywall is definitely an art. I think you guys did really well!
Super fun to watch two of you renovating your own home 🔥
A squared plus B squared equals C squared
woohoo you made trending!
As always... entertainment value 200%.   "I'm an expert" closely followed by "oh Sh**". Eamon what your friendly nerd did not tell you, one of these "MILWAUKEE 4932459597 POCKET LEVEL" stuck in pocket.  I believe you both should take a massage course, relaxation time with each other taken to a whole new level. Massage followed by hot tub... then movie.
Loveeeeee
DIY - DW tips: Might be too late.... Longest sheets possible, fewest seems, leave a small gap (1/8" ish) at all joints for compound to go in (not enough compound under the tape, guaranteed crack). Minimize butt joints, use paper tape not fibre, set the tape with sheetrock 90. Use Durabond 90 (not sandable but solid as rock) to adhere the overhanging DW to the corner at the boxed in duct, and other tricky spots. Boxed in duct will put lots of stress on joints from expansion movement. Use regular DW compound for finish coats, it's easier to sand and makes a nice finish for priming and paint.
We’ll see you Sunday, Funday, Mud-day!  Lol ❤️ you, see you next week 😊
You’ve got this! I prefer mud and taping over hanging drywall. Lol
Anybody else desperately just wanna help him connect the trailer? 😅
I had to help with drywall and it wasn't fun
oh oh,  where is your vapor barrier??  You might have to take it down.
Drywall is THE WORST. Hanging it isn't bad, but everything else sucks. It's not hard, just a major pain. If you can afford it, I'd always hire it out. Also, after doing our home renovation and doing all our own drywall, my biggest tip is to use a vacuum when you sand to try and remediate the dust, and use plastic to tape off your living areas to try and keep the dust down in those areas. Good on you for trying it! Hope it goes easier for you than it was for us! haha!
You were also right with the scalene triangle Bec......
Loveee you guys !!! 💕🔆🕊🧘🏻‍♀️🔆💕
Where is the doggo?!
I love following all your adventures - whether is hittin up Morocco or learning how to install drywall! (I also love that you guys are so close to Kingston now!!) see you Sunday! ❤️
it's actually the ceiling running out of line, not your cut by look of it
Also,  yes I personally think you're crazy to try to do drywall on your own, seems like it turned out well after all 👍 But please wear a mask while cutting or sanding drywall ⚠️
Do you currently send your chai tea to APO/FPO address (military)? Thanks.
Hey I am not expert, but I did figure out drywalling for when I renovated my townhouse in Coquitlam (near Vancouver). It can be done, but yes it's a pain and it won't look perfect, if you can live with the imperfections I say go for it. You will learn a lot and will have stories to tell. Now it does look to me like you should have done the ceiling AFTER the walls, so that you could hide the drywall seams, right now the way you did it I wonder you will you be able to cover that gap since you won't be able to mud and tape when drywall meets wood...
I think you have  both done an excellent  job,  the place looks awesome,im sure by the time  you get finished, your place will be beautiful
I think the most important part of taping and mudding drywall is to eliminate where one piece of  drywall connects to another piece of drywall (which creates a distinctive line when you want to paint). My dad doesn’t have any depth perception OR experience with drywalling, but he’s amazing at it! We’ve hired guys before and we can all see the lines of drywall connecting. So, my dad went in and fixed it all because it looked so horrible. Don’t listen to what others tell you, this is your adventure, so make it your own!💗 You guys will do great, but Eamon, being a “nerd” about this stuff will be helpful to the outcome of it😁. Thanks for making amazing content, I hope taping and mudding go well for you guys😊
I would make the guest room in the loft and open up your master bedroom to make it bigger.  Just an idea. I am sure however you do it will be awesome.
Loved every minute eamon and bec Ray of sunshine thank you 🌞❤💯
Really enjoy your videos!! One thing tho, it would be amazing if you included titles/artists of songs you use in them. Do you have a public Spotify playlist somewhere? 😊🎶
Anyone saying drywall and mudding is hard never did it before.
I have a random question why do you keep calling your wife buddy
Looking amazing!!!!!
I dry-walled (aka did the taping, mudding and sanding) when I was like 15..how is that hard? It's so much fun!
📣📢 Bec ya need a sticker or magnetic dealio when its your turn at the wheel that says    *SILLY BOYS  . . . TRUCKS ARE FOR GRRRLZ* !!
love u sooooooo much guys ;)
What brand is your bikini I love how the bottoms fit
🤟🤟 *L-E-G-E-N-N-N-D-S  opening deck shot, but 'Buddy E.' could have* *been sportin' a wee speedo dontcha think*  ?!?
Damn so thats unfair! Bac you have banging body.🥳
Plaster board work is easy, it's the plastering thats the hard bit
Firstly why did you cut all the sheets, why not a full sheet from floor to ceiling. And drywall must be supported on all four edges. There should have been a support horizontally between the top and bottom sheets as drywall is not structural and will flex between the studs
You guys are adorable. Can you just adopt me
You got this
Drywalla Dry
i didnt see any nail guards on the on the wood to keep you from drilling into the wires.
Why do you not insulate the ceiling? 🤔
Eamon glasses😍😍 i need them, where’re they from??
Lol. I’m a complete amateur and we framed and drywalled my older daughters room when I was 7 months pregnant with her little sister. My own sister and I did the mudding and taping. It’s a lot like spreading frosting. Check YouTube for how to videos.
I don't know how much drywalling you have left, but you can buy a super cheap drywall screw bit tip and it makes screwing in drywall 10x easier you won't need to worry about over screwing a screw in.
Vaccine attachment for your Sanders for mudding and taping, get pre mixed mud 3 to 4", 6 to 8", and 12" spatulas for feathering out joints, the smoother and flatter it is the less sanding is needed, dont put on too much mud to start.   Why r u not chilling in the hammock?  Mudding not too hard, sanding sucks, dust g er ts EVERYWHERE.  HENCE THE VAC attachment and good filter bags on shop vac.  Have fun, hug each other more.  It's TRUE love when u bring them tp in the am
My first thought about the town was: it looks like stars hollow from Gilmore girls. Bec 5 sec later: it's like stars hollow
Why didn’t you put insulation in the ceiling? It will make the house a lot warmer.
Are you and The Wynns giving away the same van?
I love gilmore girls,
Where is TIIIIIIMMMMMM????????
nothing says I Love you like poo news in the morning lol
COVID what that hahahahahahahahahhhahahahahhaahahahahahh we do not even wear musk any more hi from NEW ZEALAND 😂 lol
Nice work but you really should be wearing dust masks. There's a lot of crap flying around.
you guys are rockstars!!!
Not sure how much drywall you have to do... but you could get a drywall lift. It will make your life a lot easier. Or do what the guys at Life Uncontained are doing... go watch their drywalling video's to get some useful tips. But seriously - if you are putting drywall on the ceiling - get a drywall lift.
Are you going to put sound deadening material on the inside walls??
Ya did great!!!
Try the cupping technique for his back, thank me later ✌
You guys are craziness if it were human, Ilysm
What microphones are you using for the podcast? it sounds so crisp.
Yah!!!!!!!!!!😀
Of course you can do it yourself. Drywalling wasn't that hard? It just took some work and work means content for the channel and you learn new things. When renovating yourself as much as you do, hiring someone for drywalling or mudding seems totally pointless.
LOVE your editing!!! So much fun to watch you guys and I am in love with your cabin! When do you come out with more merch? :D
you guys aren't insulating every room??
My father is a contractor and he usually just hires someone to do the mud and taping as it can be very difficult to get it to look nice.
You guys got this! Life Uncontained is also dry walling so, can’t wait to see how things go ;)
Did you guys have a falling out with Tim or something? Really miss seeing him around, his interactions with Eamon was hilarious. Or is it covid ruining everything as usual?
Awwwww 💕drywall is my husband's last name lol 🥰!!! 20+ years of experience!!!  Leave  it to the professionals!!! It's a work of art! practice makes perfect 💯!
I love how easy it was to convince y’all to hang the drywall. I grew up in Talladega, AL so if you didn’t try to do it yourself you weren’t a true homeowner. Lol tape and mud and scrape and getirdone y’all! Much love!
Hey guys. Loving the Reno videos. Don’t know what it’s like in Canada but in Australia we install glue behind the drywall (plasterboard) and then don’t have to use as many screws and once the glue dries it acts as the main source of fixing. Otherwise taping is easy. Small amounts and let it dry for 24hrs between sanding. But be prepared for get dust everywhere so seal off rooms or leave the dust extraction on
Go Team Nerds! 🤘😇
What the ef man. 0 "Zero" kick backs to the people of the US? You're Dodge Dakota seems to be working fine. Yes the John Deere was a pain but c'mon man, you got a GREAT deal from Americans. Some of us are shitty but most of us are great. Hah end rant
ok you have did that b4  . nerds lll
Well Done! For amateurs and no experience, guys done a good job!! Nothing is impossible if you can make it possible! 👍👍 From SA!
Get hold of Kevin from modern self reliance, or dump the mud and use caulk put it on with a putty knife and flatten it out with an old rag roller, you can paper over the top or just paint straight over, we use it for sweeping rounded walls in walk in showers with the advantage you can create shelve pockets in the rounded corner, everyone needs some where to put their conditioner. 👍
I shouldn’t be this excited over drywall, but HECK YEAH!!
I taped but didn't mud because I covered all my walls with carsiding and my ceilings with beadboard.  Twenty years later it's still good!
My father was a taper for 40 years and so I can tell you honestly you need to hire someone good to do it.   Yes, you could do it yourselves and it could look good, but the problem is that after a month or two it could start cracking because you didn’t know what you were doing.   Many of my dad’s jobs were going to fix botched taping jobs done by amateurs.   But if you don’t care about possible cracks, then give it a shot!
Get the girl a tool belt so she can put the nails in there instead of on the floor
What was the song in the beginning?
bloody good shit mate great job ,,Eamon looks like john lennon with his retro specks haha
that was the best plug ever, it didn't feel like a commercial at all
"I DON'T HAVE ENOUGH TIME !! "  that's ,my line and it's never worked :)
At least you had a degree of success getting Eamon to use a protractor!  Get it?  degree of?  Yeah ok sorry I'll go now, bye
so many mistakes. gonna have major issues after mud and tape.
Someone send Eamon a jockey wheel for the trailer 😂😂
❤️ from India 🇮🇳
can stress enough, stagger your joints, causes less cracks in the future years to come !!!
Did drywall by myself when I first bought my house in my early 20's. The biggest pain is the absolute mess it makes throughout the ENTIRE HOUSE when you sand it. I was vacuuming dust (and therefore unintentionally breathing it in too) for what felt like weeks. Do yourselves a favor and section off and put plastic sheet around the area you are working in to keep the dust levels down in the rest of the house. I have every faith in you that it will turn out AWESOME because you guys rock at everything you try! - Alis
If you do more drywalling, overlap your pieces to help prevent cracking. Over windows and doorways, don't just cut a piece for the top, use a bigger piece and cut out the window/door so you have continuous drywall around the opening. Hard to screw up mudding, you will just mud, sand, sand, sand, sand. Use less mud and apply more coats if you need to - sanding is for losers! Love your content!
Mud and tape: give it time. I usually do three coats. First with a 4 inch knife, filling the gaps and covering the yellow tape. 2nd coat with a 10 inch knife smoothing the edges of the first coat. 3rd coat with a 12 inch knife to finish it all. The idea is to make sure the mud is as smooth as possible because the real pain is not mudding it's sanding. So the less sanding you do the easier it is. For the corners I recommend investing in a reinforced tape called "sure corner". It will save time and booboos.
I thought we might meet that special doggie on today’s blog!!!
Good Job Buddies
“A farting mule will never tire...a farting man is the one to hire” 😆😄😆😄
First Things First: i love following you Around in your vlogs. Thank you for sharing your life with uns 🥰 second important> BEC.... where did. you get those black yoga pants from and what is your fav brand? X
Know Trent is going to ask you too do there's 😂
Love you guys, thats all this week.. or maybe Its Friday!!! what what haahahha.. Trent be like, shiz i gota dry wall a whole dang house soon lol..
I was so sad when I realised I was already half way through it please make more on Wednesday and Sunday
So yeah. Mudding and taping sucks. But you can do it. If I can do it you can do it.
That did sound crispy, what kind of set up are you using for your pod cast?
Did anyone else see the ring again?? Did I miss something??? 😵😍😍
Do you plan on painting the outside of the cabin ❤️
Insane drywall effort guys, Eamon just fit a dolly wheel on your trailer will stop the back pain my friend
Make sure you glue your plasterboard sheets to your studs before screwing if not your sheets will pop after a year or two
Another tip: score the drywall with your utility knife on the front side of the drywall, not the backside 👍
My hat goes off to you two! I always reminded my faja telling us how difficult and  rewarding putting in dry wall in all the many homes he built. Not many want to take on a challenge and you two have done such a great job! It has inspired my husband and i to go for it and get projects done around the house. Biggest project to come is building our wall around our home. Praying we’ll find the help we need and all the patience for the process 😅😀 can’t wait to see that cabin completely, but low key enjoying the work going into it. 🤍☺️ it’s satisfying!
I think you’re u guys are amazing!!! I wish I were you!!!!🥰 I wake up like...it’s Sunday!!!
Great progress! I bet you can tape and mud too!
You need to separate the vertical joints on your walls, each vertical joint (butt joint) should only be 4’ long on your 8’ high walls. Your splitting the top sheet and bottom sheet in the middle of the same stud. That makes for an 8’ butt joint from ceiling to floor, which when taped and mudded will make for a very wide finished joint from ceiling to floor. Basically you will have a large vertical hump in the middle of all your walls from ceiling to floor where each of these butt joints line up unless you can find an experienced drywall finisher! A couple drywall terms: A flat joint is the seem that runs through the middle of your wall from corner to corner and has the factory tapered edge. A butt joint is the seem that runs vertical, where two drywall sheets match up in the middle of a stud.
EAMON WEARING A CAPE TOWN TSHIRT OMG I'M SO HAPPY TO BE FROM CAPE TOWN 😭❤️
Looks Great, Team Work Baby!
I'm a Tape and Bedder by trade and part time sheetrocker... PLEASE DO NOT try the tape and bed yourself. It's really hard to fix certain mistakes so please just look for a professional that doesn't charge that much in your area. :) Thanks for taking the time to read, God bless ya!
10:15...I'm out.
5;48.......hey, hey, jaja   Great Video!
It looks like it will take forever because your have loads of walls. Try I’m sure you can hack a new skill
Buy a tens unit for your back. It wonders for mine before it got too bad. I eventually had to get surgery to remove a severely impinged L5/S1 but the tens unit did WONDERS to help with the temp back pain. Throwing out your back is no joke.
Hahah of course you will do the dry wall. Thank if anyone tells you know you will definitely do it and try. This house is the best project for Eamon and Bec because Eamon needs to be doing something always.
Great job ! You’re an awesome team!!
ITS THE DRYWALL FOR ME!  Hahaha the only thing I kept thinking of when you did your drywall dance!🤣🤣 much love!💖💖
I helped my dad drywall our 200 year old house in Vermont on the border with Canada when I was 14 years old. Loved it! A skill that made me feel capable of anything! That was the early 1970s! Drywall Queens UNITE!
You can do it ! Get the bigger knives and trowels... so many expect to lay magic with tiny little putty knives. Great days to you two, see you next week !
I wish the borders were open. I would come tape and mud for you! Very little sanding needed when I get done!
Hanging sheet rock is easy enough. I paid someone else to tape, mud, and sand. It all is about how much of a perfectionist you are and whether you’ll care if it isn’t just right. Best money I spent, as it gave me back what would have been weeks of effort
Dry wall isnt that bad. Its the mudding. I did most of my house.
.. real quick..roll up a small face towel lay on your stomach and put the towel between the floor and front of the hip (the one in pain) while laying there and have your beautiful wife ☺️ rub in some tiger cream or some warming lotion and then alternate (next day) with ice packs  And epson salt baths (or hot tub😅?)  Love your videos such great shots you’ll are doing an amazing job happy 2021!!!
Wow are you creating a lot of joints, you are going to get really good at taping and mudding.
You remind me of Clint Eastwood In Magnum Force “ A man’s got to know his limitations “ lol How is Bob doing? Please tell him I asked about his recovery. Still in my prayers
I'm a retired electrician so have worked along many a Drywaller. There loonie and goofy and seem a little hard to figure out. Ya you'll do OK as drywallers. LOL
You didn't put any glue behind the board. It's going to be very slappy.
Where’s the foster doggie? Are these backlogged?
mud and tape isnt that bad
Even the pros started out not knowing what they were doing. If ya got it hung, you can probably tape and mud 👍🏻 I believe in ya
You guys are amazing and it looks great!!! Soooo exciting!!!
I searched for drywall alternatives and there are several methods with pros/cons. Did you consider other methods?
Amazing as usual lol. I too like to nerd and I was wondering dimensions and sizing specifics during cutting 😭😂
I actually live in Sleepy Hollow lol. For a moment I thought you were talking about my little town.
You've done a great job so far.  I reckon it will look spectacular when it's finished.  Never say never.  You're *****d before you start.
You need one or two of these so your screws don't go in to far.  $4.50 DEWALT DW2014 Drywall Screw Setter Bit Tip
Bec would not be allowed in Iran🙄.... cuz there its illegal to wear anything that even shows the sholders... but anyway love your videos! And your the cutest couple👌
You 2 are the best I hope I can win the Van I really want to take my disabled son on a Road Trip around the Map
I love how you guys are such loving and caring people but can still kinda roast each other 😂 . Love your guys's vids!
So master bedroom eh? Where do you keep the slaves?
diggin eamon's glasses!!
Careful with that old drywall. Probably has asbestos in it.
Nice job Guys!! Is there anything you two can't do?? I say, GO FOR THE MUDDING✌️✌️✌️
Hanging drywall is easy. The tape and mud can be learned by watching videos and less is more
Ahhh! My family has an island on a lake one lake away from the town y’all go into! We go through the lock and boat in to get supplies and ice cream from town :)
Check out the Vancouver Carpenter.  He gives a lot of insight on how to mud and tape.
Check out mudding and taping tips from Jeff at Home Renovision DIY and you’ll be good to go! Lots of great advice for homeowners willing to tackle anything.
You're flat out crazy! I did that and almost lost my mind! Seriously!
Definitely hire someone to tape and mud; you will not regret the decision. If you do it yourself you will notice every mistake.
Eamon is a whole vibe and I’m here for it
WHO was that long haired, bearded STUD on FaceTime? 🤔🥰❤️
Mud and tape is pretty easy it just takes a while .. we did our unfinished basement and we are pretty happy with it.. if we did it, I’m sure you guys can do too. Greetings from Alberta..
in my country the beans tune is... baked beans are good for your heart the more you eat the more you fart the more you fart the better you feel so eat baked beans for every meal lol enjoy it
18:39 Metaltech Ladder - I am working with them down in USA - awesome thanks.
Crazy to read all the comments i did mud n tape for my folks when i was a kid n did it a few times as an adult, its my favorite thing to do, so precise n clean n makes it look so good!! Love the sanding, priming n painting too.
Hmm why not destroy the cabin and build a 400 thousand dollar house  u wanted to get away  from the city it seams like  your no ruffing  it at all it seamed that what u wanted in the begging living in a van not having much looks like you have lots now just saying
you can mud and tape very easily. it’s simple
You did great!
Drywall isn’t hard, just tedious. Mud and tape isn’t hard either, just messy.
You can do it!!  If you hire someone, they will make it look sooo easy and you will regret not doing it yourself. Just take your time. If you struggle, hire someone. You two are doing great by the way. Happy for you.
Good work, it ain't easy as it looks, but you make it look fun😁
Take the time to let ur dry wall mud and tape dry. Do not cut that timming short. It will cause bubbling and cracking to your drywall later on if its not fully dried . Also a good sanding job. Makes a nice smooth finish. Havent dry walled since I was 7 yrs old. But my dad would take me to work and I patched the screws. Dry walling is an art!! Good luck. You hanging drywall was actually not bad. Good job!!
“Let’s do it your way and then cut to oops ” I think that’s the next merch. LOL.
How do I find your pod cast? Is it in u tube somewhere? Would hate to miss you both!
You look soooooo much better and adorable with your hair cut!!! You guys are the bomb!! Hello from San Diego!
Somebody get Eamon a chiro! 😉
A great job on the walls👍👍
#10 on trending🥺
Stagger vertical joins. Try not to have a join at the corner of a window. Mudding is an art. Hire someone or you will have a lot of sanding and dust to deal with.
You both always make me smile! Always look forward to your videos! :)
Remember: "Less is more" When tape n Mudd'n. The more time you take in muddin and making it smooth the less sanding you'll have to do.. fyi drywall sanding "SUCKS" And its messy! Dusty! So if you can get an attachment or rig one up with a shop vac the less dust you'll have all over the house.use drywall sand paper,  its screen so the dust falls thru. Good luck! Oh yeah wear masks! You dont want white boogers or cough up white loogies!!;D..have fun
Always love to see your progress. Inspires me as I work on my house. I found drywall bit to be extremely helpful in setting the screw to the correct depth.
I am in the middle of doing my own drywall finishing. It's an intense shoulder exercise when sanding the ceiling!
mud and tape is easy...i've done it before in my master bedroom....looked great when it was finished.....you got this.
Just put in 250 tickets. One to support but also to win that van. I’ve really been lost in life. And need a get away but do it without seeing people or having to pay extensive amounts of money.
I mud and taped when my parent were building our house I was maybe 10. It’s not hard just time consuming bc u have to wait for it to dry sand it and then patch and wholes left and repeat. It’s just a s time consuming as painting
I could be wrong but are you not going to add more insulation to the rest of your guest room? My husband and I are starting our first tiny house journey ourselves and have no experience doing any of this lol but big fans of yours since trinity 🚐
I aspire to have Bec’s style! ....P.S. I wore my sage sweater today and my mom said it’s “the cutest and most perfect sweater” so same to say you guys killed it!!💙💙
Just subscribed. love your content, love your motivation, and love the cabin!  I just did a home addition (whole back of the house out 16') and while I did everything on the addition (including electrical and plumbing) I refused to hang drywall!  Its dirty, annoying, frustrating, but most importantly... back breaking!  I dont have the back to do drywall and I just hate playing with mud.  I know you have not done the mud yet, but you will really regret the final look if mud is not done right.  But if you think the drywall and mudding is bad.. the SANDING is even worse!  Painters plastic is your friend unless you want dust EVERYWHERE!  Good luck!
Wondering if you're going to put insulation in anywhere???
#BOBLOVE! Missed bob! Love bob. 💖💖💖
The muddying and taping is not hard. The pain in the but though is the sanding, sanding, and sanding after. Not only do the seams need to be taped and muddled, and sanded, but every stinkin’ screw hole needs mud too. Oh, and the mud shrinks down into the screw holes, so you’ll probably have to mud them at least twice.  Now let’s talk about the dust all this sanding creates.  IT GOES EVERY WHERE!  Better get more filters for the shop vac, and your masks. I think that there’s  a sanding attachment for thee vac that pulls the dust in while you sand.  I did this in northern New Hampshire.  Good grief I wish we had had professionals available.
My first time mudding looked good - until i painted the wall! Then all the imperfections showed through. i put up wall paper to hide the seams!
3", 5" and 8" knife for applying your joint compound.  Tape your seams, start with the smallest knife. Get one of those small red troughs to put your compound in.  Three coats, lightly sand in between. Use the fiberglass tape. Do NOT prime anything until you are happy. Trying to sand after primer is close to impossible.  Take your time.  You got this.
If your mud job looks like crap in the end and you don't like it, throw about 5X the amount of mud on it and attack it with a wide puddy knife. make it art! it can end up looking like a cob house with a pretty awesome texture.
Love from India, kerala 😍❤️❤️
The drywall (especially in the living room) looks amazing! 👏
hey hey hey Great Job ..... Eamon & Bec , drywall looks great.
Loving the progress and humor! Way to go!
To mud and tape get the right spatulas and watch some tutorials on you tube and use base coat for the taped joints oh and get a proper corner tool for your right angles. You can do it, you are definitely good at diy, just research it.
When hanging rock horizontally always stagger your courses preferably by two joist and when going around window openings and doors etc. If you can hang it vertical hang the whole sheet then cut out openings with roto zip or rock saw ! Taping the toughest to learn is butt joints and inside corners ! Make sure to add water and whip it with a paddle in HD 1/2 drill when bucket is opened. Nothing to it after your fourth or fifth house you will get the hang of it ✌️💜🎸
I want that ladder!!
Just a trick from a trucker walk it off next time and then put something on the ground outside the truck to back up to.
You can do it! Not that difficult to do. I helped my brother and we did good. Can't wait to see you tackling the job!!👍💣💯💯
I don’t know if you’ve tried all your bedroom yet.  I would encourage you to insulate that wall between yours and the guest room. Or you’ll be hearing each other‘s conversations. It looks like you can do it. It is open in your room.
You can do the dry wall......just YouTube it!
I have done my share of dry walling, it is not fun, it is not hard, it is just so boring you want to cry or be drunk the whole time. In all our remodels we never had the right equipment but it always came out fine, except once. I thought I would do something different with the texturing, something a little artistic. It came out so rough that you could cut anything that rubbed against the wall, which resulted in a complete sand down and a light retexturing. I never got creative again. Good luck!
That face at 4:55 😂 Maximum concern.
Tape and mud do ittttttt
Contest page Omaze states no donations or payments needed to enter. Yet one cannot enter without a donation/payment. That sucks!
You need a. Jockey wheel for that trailer, save your back, disconnect and drive away even when the trailer is full, easier to use the reverse camera to get in the right spot to hook up. Too many benefits for like $60 to $100 au so probably similar price where you are. It’s a no brainer. Loving your work and vids btw.
The key to mudding is good lighting and really taking your time sanding and mudding.
Mud+tape is easy, y’all got this!
I think the most relatable part about getting your partner the toilet paper was not taking it out of the package first!!!!!!
you can do it!  Just be patient and take your time.  It is easier to add more coats to smooth it out than to put too much and have to sand out the lumps.  Do many coats, don't try to do it all in one.  Practice on one wall before do the rest.  Also...I agree with those who are saying to insulate interior walls.  Totally worth it and insulation is cheap.
You guys made my night! Always keeping us laughing! :-) Plus seeing Trents face & his advice was super cool! <3 Trent&Allie & You guys!
The sanding of mud will get all over cabin if you don’t have the right equipment.  Sander needs a vacuum. It’s hard hard work without right equipment.
2 vid a wk please.  Lol
Love love love Trent and Allie!!!! I thought for sure Trent would be for drywall!! I used to tape and mud drywall and it’s not that bad... not thattttt bad
Stagger sheets
Making sure you mud is smooth and doesn’t look like a sore thumb sticking out is key to nice finished walls
Honestly, i luvvv your chanel. I look forward every week to watch your new video. Every single time I watch yoir videos I have the biggest smile on my face. Its either finish or starting well my week. :🙂😊
You guys dress outside in the snow like we dress during Australian winter 😅. We are so excited for your podcast!!
Don't know how far behind your videos are, but if you haven't started tape and mud yet, be sure to check out Home Renovision DIY's "How to Drywall" playlist. He has great tips and makes it look easy (it isn't.) Love your videos!
I LOVE to mud. It is really satisfying. Just get yourselves some basic tools - a wide 6 in FLEXIBLE putty knife, a palate or handheld "hod" to hold joint compound, have a few smaller putty knives for small areas and maybe a triangle for those spots where nothing else will fit AND a LARGER 12-14 in knife to fair in the edges after the first couple of coats. Start with the 6 in knife and after a couple of coats of mud use the larger to fair the mud feather thin at the edges. I use only the mesh fiberglass tape for seams and corners and I'd recommend that too. Paper seems tricker to get to stick for we part-time tapers and the mesh is strong.   One of the most important tricks I learned from watching professional drywallers is to use your 6 in knife to knock off your high mud spots once it drys between coats. It makes far less a mess than sanding and if you are careful and use large knives that fair your edges well it makes for minimal sanding at the end. Remember, you can fill in concavities or voids as you go but anything above the surface has to be knocked off or sanded. Also, do one side of the corner the first day - that way you can leave the little "bead' that rolls over and that will chip right off the next day. And then do the second edge of the corner. Good luck! YOU CAN DO THIS!!!! GO FOR IT!!! Brava! for the NERD in the house who knows her angles when hanging sheetrock! Good work Bec.
Calls Trent for advice. First mistake, lol.
Was his mudder a mudder?
Actually, I think you can do the mudding and taping.  Maybe look for the newer mesh tape with adhesive on the back.  The part I think needs to be hired out is the texturing.  A good "orange peel" or similar texture will hide imperfect taping.
Looks like both you and Jeremy from Good Simple Living YouTube hurt your backs, Eamon
Anytime we’ve done drywall we use a texture gun to give the walls a slight texture. That way any mistakes or imperfections from taping get covered up!
Hilarious video you two. My recommendation for Eamon's back issues (I've suffered many a time) is acupuncture. I absolutely swear by it. It has never failed me. In my situation, 1 a week for 3 weeks has usually done the trick. Try it out.
Use Fiberglass sheetrock  Tape on joints.
Where's the insulation??  You should have insulated the ceiling and walls.  It keeps the house warmer especially between the rooms and ceilings.  It's got some sound proofing too.   Always insulate!
Holy cow. I've been away for months due to the election. Amazing giveaway! Love you guys in the cabin but was surprised to see you NOT  in Trinity! Catching up tonight. Can't wait.
My favorite but was Eamon struggling with the car and the thing at the back 😂😂😂
Donated ❤️🤞🏽🎉
We have done all our mud and tape ourselves. The tricky part is making sure you sanded well. You think it’s good and then you add some paint and you see all your mistakes. We always do thin layers, sand between each layer. I also learnt font someone but have never tried it that you can actually thin out the mud just a tiny bit for easier application.
Just wanted to tell u thanks for being my bedtime routine on Sunday night 😍🥰
For the love of baby J, do NOT mud and tape. But - if you are stubborn and do it anyways, buy a drywall sander/vacuum attachment.
Sooo I didn’t even know that I didn’t understand the layout of the cabin until this short tour 😂 Looking great guys 🤘🏼
My girlfriend and I have been watching your channel for a while and love the hard work that you both do.  You have a great chemistry and are doing life the right way... Two thumbs up
Love Eamon's sunglasses.
What kind of ladder is that?
You can do it.  My husband did ours and it took some trial and error but the perfectionist in him did an amazing job.
Go for it!
I always look forward to watching your videos as you never fail at delivering smiles :) A request from the Vanlife days of yesteryear...please consider bringing back Freestyle Fridays with Eamon? I do miss those spontaneous creations. Be safe, stay youthful.
Hey, if I can do it, I have no doubt you guys can do it easily.  Go for it!!!
I’ve not heard the word “protractor,” so many times since 9th grade! Y’all did a great job on the drywall!
Here are the tips, its EZ...#1. buy the pre mixed mud in the box. Super EZ and super cheap. Start doing the screws first they are EZ.  #2...Use the tape that is self adhesive.....another short cut that will make life very EZ. The thing is you cannot screw this up. I will warn you when it comes to time to sand it makes a mess  and a big one. Since its winter and your place is shut up figure a way for dust control like dropping some plastic. Now the sanding  doesn't need to be perfect. I assume you will texture when you are done? This covers and hide all imperfections. I suggest you learn on the small bedroom. The branch out.  Good Luck !
Hey is there another house right next door to you?? Love your channel!!!
Your sponsor made me yearn for the next years to come. Unfortunately, only being a senior in high school, my dreams are still only as such. Dreams. I literally cannot express how badly I want to be living in a van, traveling, not knowing the next destination. Thank you for being one of the first vanlifer’s I’ve ever watched and for all the inspiration you’ve given me. I love you guys!! ❤️❤️
Mud and tape isn’t too bad. Just remember that you need to use more mud than you think because it shrinks as it dries!
How to.we enter for the van?
I never see you guys add insulation
I’ve done construction for 20yrs,  I’ll do everything but finish drywall.  DO NOT DO IT.  It’s not worth any money you might “save”. It is an art to mud and tape DO NOT DO IT
I found putting up the bottom sheet first so then the top sheet can rest on the bottom sheet while you screw it in is easier. Also making your first cut on the white side where the paper is much thinner and then snap. Mesh tape is much easier for the beginner. If you use paper tape, put mud on wall then put on paper tape and press into mud. Wait until this dries before putting another coat of mud on top. If you get in a hurry and put another coat on too soon the paper tape will pull away and create a bubble in your seam. Mesh tape can be put right on the drywall first before any mud. Good luck
You guys can do anything you put your minds too!!!! Can’t wait to see how it goes!
when mudding, first of all use the paper tape and NOT the mesh, also to make it way easier you need a banjo (not the instrument) you tube it.  good luck
I would think dry wall would be the easiest of all your projects. but, I am no comtractor
Looking nice. I love how you guys are not scared to do tackle any projects.
Love your channel!  BEST investment I've ever made is an inversion table.  Stretches those muscles out painlessly and immediately and no pain meds needed.
Not a good idea doing the  Mud and Tape... Sooo.. Just send it guys :")
Omg amazing love yall
Just watch a couple you tube videos on muffing and taping, it is not any harder than all the other stuff you have done!!! You can do it!!
Um? Mask?
what is the brand of your boots?
Yall are everything 😍 #NoMoreBlueInsulation 🙌
I’m from uk can I donate / enter the giveaway ???x
me & my roommate are calling each other "bud" now. Thanks a lot eamon and bec ;) see ya sunday
My 2 cents...  Anyone can mud & tape because you can always put extra on and sand it off.  BUT...  Sanding is a HUGE mess.  Basically your entire cabin will look like 37.4 bags of flour exploded in every room.  And when you see professionals do it you'll see the difference.  Basically they can get done in a day what will take you guys a week to do.  I'm ALL for doing things yourself (that's the way I am) but in this instance...  You MAAAAYYYY want to go with a tape & mud guy.
you can do it. mesh tape cracks less. then mus, then again, as flat and lump free as possible. sand or wet sand. if you see a seem...only a third float on certain spots. boom
Oh laugh you two, if you measure something really well, master the Pythagorean theorem, everything goes much easier and quite accurately. First artificial axes, mark exactly with a long spirit level, measure exactly from there and it will fit. In corners where it is tight, first make a model with cardboard, goes quickly and if that is OK, cut the part 1/1. Greetings from Frankfurt and stay healthy.
Commercial Architect here...with three decades of experience and many, many, home remodels...100%, 100%, 100% HIRE SOMEONE TO MUD+TAPE!!!!
You guys did great, its looks amazing!
You guys are good friends with Trenton alley I just watch him
You'll only really see how good until you paint it.
Love your glasses Bec! What brand/style are they?
You are awesome, Bec!! And you too, Eamon, I guess!  You all know women rule the world.  PS You should do your own drywall.  It’s a no brainer and why would you pay money when it’s easy to do.
You fit in beautifully with my retirement hobby -- watching other people work! Thanks!
Eamon YOU MUST PUT metal plates over every spot where a wire passes thru a stud.
I love you guys and your videos, but what’s with all the sponsored content recently?
OH! my one picture hanging from a short possible fire,
Does Tim mud and tape? Because if he does...bring back Tim!
Drywalling is easy, just spot the screws, mud the cracks and tape it......and wait a day before you top coat the tape and your good. After that, it's all texture and sanding. Oh yeah, and paint.
Eamon with short hair is soooo weird. I like it but it's weiiiird!
Drywall looks great, way to go!
Mud and tape shows all imperfections, hire a pro or you will just stare at your mistakes for as long as you own the joint
if you guys have to scrape anymore spray foam, use your oscillating saw it’s 10x faster
Check out Vancouver Carpenter
mudding and taping is fairly easy! i’m 17 and i helped my dad with drywall in 2 different houses already :-)
Beans, beans are good for your heart, the more you eat, the more you fart..  From England :)
Whats the song at 5:50? You guys should do song credits, #1 just cuz and #2 so i dont have to spend an hour trying to find these jams lol
Hey will u add sound proofing insulation to your walls in bedrooms!
Do the same over the windows either run the drywall completely over the window and cut it out or run the butt joint above the header
Good job! I knew you could do it👍
I'm an old drywaller/contractor who hung and taped drywall for almost 20 years and glad to give you a few tips. One tip, when you hanging drywall you need to stagger your butt joints, meaning don't put the top and bottom joints on the same stud but stagger them. Also if you can, run your drywall over the door header past the door jamb at least 6 or 8 inches. Both of these will help prevent future cracking of your joints. Especially the door jamb given the stress the jamb will create over the door.
You need a jack dolly wheel for that trailer
I’m glad that we were never told to hire out our drywall project.  It’s been years, but I don’t regret ever doing it ourselves.  You have to feel empowered!  I’m enjoying seeing your progress!  👏
“🥲” me Bc I want to enter bro get a free van but I’m broke and I don’t have a card.. lol
Mudding isn't that bad as long as you have the right tools to apply.
Hahah where’s that protractor at when you need it?
Best of luck mudding and taping! Get yourself some extra sandpaper to save a trip into town! Lol See you Sunday!
Oh yeah the electrical wire trapped between the spray foam and the drywall is a bit of a problem. You could easily punture the wire with a nail or screw hanging a picture or other.
Hey guys.   You are so much fun to watch.  Ok, you did great with the drywall.  I know people are saying don't do mud and tape, I don't think that's the hard part, make sure you have the right supplies.  I think they mean, SANDING IS THE HARD PART.  You don't want the tape lines to show, or the screw heads.  Seriously, the better you tape and mud, smoothing it out, feathering it out.  I think you'll do ok with the mud and tape.  Although I am not a professional drywall or mudder/taper I am a dancer, no I'm not, but I'm not a construction person, so you probably should not take my word for it. haha, love you guys and the videos.  Stay safe and stop being a man, Eamon, and take care of yourself.  Get the Advil.
Watch Vancouver Carpenter on YouTube! He's awesome at drywall and taping.
Yep, I agree.  You should insulate inside walls for a number of reasons.
Those mics sound amazing!
You made a big mistake hanging the drywall...too many butt joints...good luck with the tape and mud scenario. Otherwise love your adventure!
Good job keep er lit
So great 😊
Why do people subscribe just to give a thumbs down? We love you guys!
Eamon, take it from someone who has been dealing with back problems for nearly 50 years. I either sit up straight in a chair, or lay on my stomach on the floor, or I have one of those workman's back braces I'll slip the ice pack or heated rice pack into so I can walk around. Put an ice pack on it first, not too cold, use a kitchen towel or paper towels to insulate a bit. No more than 10-15 minutes of that. Then MOIST heat for another 10-15 minutes. Those packs filled with raw rice that you stick in the microwave are good to use. Again a kitchen towel can avoid the rice from burning your skin. Avoid twisting motions or lifting anything above 10 lbs for a few days. Tylenol or Motrin or Aleve. If none of those does it on it's own you can take Tylenol and EITHER the Motrin OR Aleve (never all three). Make sure you take them with some food and don't take more than instructions say. Lay flat on the floor with your legs up on the couch, scoot your butt up against the base of the couch. Lay there for 30 minutes. Avoid twisting motions when getting up.  To help keep back problems at bay do exercises to strengthen your stomach and ab muscles work the muscles of your abs and lower abs. (don't remember what they are called). Those muscles and your obliques muscles need to be in balance with your back muscles. Avoid laying on your stomach while in bed. Sleeping on your side with a small pillow between your knees can help too.  Good Luck!  The worst time I threw my back out  I was in my early 20's and getting ready for work. I was stepping into my jeans and my back went out so bad I was in bed for a month.  I had to think while in bed "How bad do I need to get to the bathroom?", "How long can I go without getting up for food and water?".  Seriously.
what is the track @ 5:54 I MUST KNOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Just keep your little paws off electrical please! ⚡⚡⚡⚡
Yeah, good luck with that🤣
I skimmed through the comments and they all seem to be generally supportive. As a professional drywaller mudder taper i couldn't stop cringing during this video at the number of horrible mistakes you made in your ignorance that reduced the end quality and added on extra work. I will be truly shocked if that drywall does not crack at every joint next to a window or door within the month.  All honest mistakes because you didn't know the common issues and how to avoid them. But big ones that will result in very noticeable cracking that will show up very soon.  But you have already shown a willingness to live in less than ideal conditions if it will save you some money, so good on you for being willing to do this as an uninformed amature. Drywalling sucks and mudding and taping sucks even more.
Good luck with mud and tape.
You guys sure try out whogivesacrap toilet paper. It comes in a cardboard box and the rapping around the toilet paper is recyclable too.  It’s a big win on for the planet.  They also have paper towels and Kleenex.  We love ours😍
On the occasional Sunday’s I have to work bunch early in the morning, I forget all about your video upload because the kitchen I’m in is not fun, which is unusual, so when I get off work and take a shot(or five) and get surprised with eamon and bec day, it just makes it so much better. I didn’t even like y’all four years ago. Who’da thunk! Ya won me over, much love!!
So glad the podcast is coming back!!! Can’t wait to listen
Fantastic! You are learning a lot. Congratulations!
You guys have the best vlogs
It might already be too late to comment ... but watching you put drywall over foam insulation on what looks to be an exterior wall. Where is the plastic vapor-barrier? 😳
Y'all are doing such an awesome job, so looking forward to when you have all completed with your cabin. And, it's fun watching y'all doing the work on it and all the fun stuff y'all are doing in between. Y'all are just a trip, and make me laugh and my day too. Love y'all from me and my dad in Odessa TX USA, see y'all next Sunday. Be blessed and safe too. 🤗💖🤗💖🤗💖🤗
ya'll need SOH CAH TOA
I drywalled (including mudding & taping) my sister's laundry room -- 2 short walls, 1 long, and the ceiling. NOT fun, but not a showstopper.   :-)  As far as straight lines in 1970s houses... wellllll..... when we put up wood paneling in the family room (and it's harder to  get more 1970s American than that, eh?) my grandfather was pulling his hair due to measurements never quite being right. We finally just used paper to make a template and then literally cut a shallow sine wave into the top of each panel, and voila! they finally fit perfectly....
you did the hard part.  you can mud the seams.  get 3 tape knives 6", 8", and 10 inches.  go for pancake batter constancy.  don't overwork seams and use tapping knives to knock off drips and high spots.
Get the Chirp Wheel for Eamons back!!!! It’s the best thing ever
Love the music and the effort..  You're great.
lol okay I'm sorry but you guys crack me up - my husband and I used to have a small drywall business back in the early 80s and I know all to well the pain in the arse hanging drywall is, next time you deal with a full size sheet, get a kicker (black gadget that you use with your foot to hold up the sheet).  Taping and texturing isn't that hard.
My whole entire family pretty much knows how to do drywall!!  Here in Louisiana we pretty much do everything ourselves if we can 😂 my husband’s dad used to live in a 3 BR house  that his dad built! all he bought was the land and used the wood to build with his bare hands with an outhouse! We now use that same house as a deer camp or family get away (theres a toilet in their now.) back then they had a wood burning stove and no A/c and he had 4 other siblings and when they weren’t building or in school they would play in the woods!
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Love watching ur vids hv watched for ages since u started the van build and travelled.   But bet there is no way being in U.K. I could enter the comp to win a van is there xx
Next week....dust....everywhere.
You can mud and tape! So easy.
Beautiful area! Westport is a cute little town
Can y’all show some of your recipes?
Mudding isn’t that bad, watch a few videos and remember less is more.  Edit: I’ve finished several weekend warrior drywall jobs, so while I stand behind my less is more advice... hire the job out, it will be complete in a matter of days, diy mudding will take weeks.
I don’t know why people say drywall is so bad. I hang drywall and tape and mud usually once a week turn some tunes on and time will fly by.
Light spray with apple cider vinegar and a smooth sponge = no dust.
Genuine question. Why did you choose not to insulate above the ceiling?
Recommend after mud dries use large yello sponge with water to smooth out works much better than sanding so much. I think you did GREAT!! On hanging the drywall😎
Wow! What a difference. It looks so much better. The nerd is always needed. Hehehe. Great team work guys.🤗😘🌼🇻🇪
love your videos!!!!!!!
Mudding tips... use sticky tape to tape seams, get some nice blades (especially a wide one) and a 90 degree blade.  First coat use heavy mud then others may switch to lightweight.  Many small coats better than putting on too thick.  Get big sponge to smooth out after dry (No sandpaper= no dust).  Everyone told us not to do it but it was easy.  But if you do want to make a mess with dust, we are sure everyone will enjoy the footage...
when you do the mud and taping do very light coats and let them dry between coats. And when you sand the walls make sure you change your air filter in your central gas unit often so you don't fill your duct work full of dust.
Loved the video! Can I please get the title/artist for the song playing when you guys are on your way to the post office? Thanks!! :)
Why must you shout so much! Piercing!
Check out Ivy Tech's channel for some really good videos on taping & mudding.  It really made a difference for me. Yes, I've done my own taping & mudding.
Cool to see you pull I to our little town, and then to see our son in your vid outside the hardware store.
The podcast sounds is bad.
Eamon,  get a cheap jack to support the trailer hitch so it's a little above your truck's ball. Back up the truck, drop the jack and you're almost ready to go.
Eamon, do us all a favor and don't do a close up of your face, because your ain't pretty. dude
If I had that house, I would eliminate the guest home, enlarging the kitchen area, removing the wall  behind kitchen and guest room.  Putting in a walking pantry, and storage for appliances and things that are only used occassionally. Guest room  up in loft area.
Someone once said something like, “Don’t tell someone they can’t do something when they’re in the midst of doing it”. If You Believe you can, you’re correct. Well done!! 👏👏👏👏🙌🏼🎊🎉

******** READ ME ******  Make sure wherever there will be lights casting shadows, the joints are super smooth.  You'll really notice them when it's done and painted.  That is critical...   Mud and Taping is like icing a cake.  Anyone can do it, but it's really tough to make it look smooth like the pros do.  You'll end up using a ton more mud than a pro would and be a long time sanding it down.  That's the difference between Joe's and Pro's.  I've done my share of building and two things I won't touch...   mud / taping and installing carpets.  Leave it to the pros!  Worth every penny.
I look forward to your videos each week.  My husband the nature boy keeps trying to convince this city girl, we should do the same.  I feel like he may be right each video I watch.  Thanks for sharing your journey! What are the boots you both wear?
Fill the gaps with duroc 90( prevents joints from cracking and shrinkage)  use paper tape for the corners not the mesh tape. Make sure to use the right muddying knife for each application of mud. The premixed boxes of mud are nice to use. After the coats of mud are to be sanded, use a light close to the wall so it’s easier to spot any high spots. It’s tedious work but when your done and the wall is primed then painted it will look amazing. You guys are doing great, cheers.
Gosh, I wish I was there helping!!!!! Dry wall is HARD. I tried it and after I had made a total mess of it, I hired someone to fix it all. But I tried. So far, it looks like y'all are doing a GREAT job with it!
You mentioned you aren’t renovating the bathrooms. Any particular reason for this? Or just because they don’t really need it? Love you guys
love ❤️
First day on your channel - love it! (found via comment on Trent and Allie's channel)  Takes me back to my early '30's when I bought a "project" on Deer Isle in coastal Maine.  Small owner-built house (think he procured materials at the dump and in other folks barn lofts - rural dumps were actually pretty great back then) - rough-cut lumber, nothing square or plumb - crappy rock wool insulation (sinuses still remember that sans-mask removal) , cheap panelling, ancient linoleum, and of course rotting joists, single-pain windows, and inoperative septic system (discovered post-sale):  a 50 gal. rusted out barrel (still gunning for the "inspector" I paid).  Positives:  great oak recycled staircase and red oak flooring, good house proportions, a really old "marginal" barn (1860's), southern exposure,  and "down the hill" to the ocean.  I was single, hated my job (really just my boss), and wanted to live alone.  Working full-time, a 2hr. one-way commute away, and NO money.  This was the mid-80's, so there was still affordable real wood available for flooring, trim, doors, windows, wonderful used brick for the chimney re-build, leftover granite at the abandoned quarries for steps and garden walls, used, great condition Vermont Casting wood stove, and folks who needed work at a reasonable rate who were desperate enough to let an inexperienced woman work with them.  Can TOTALLY relate to hanging sheetrock when no square/plumb and "sticking-out bits".  No screws for me either - all done with a hammer and sheetrock nails like the ones you pulled.  I actually liked the taping and mudding - sort of an artistic endeavor, but took forever.  Laid ceramic tiles in my kitchen - another project where I learned a lot, so of course saw all my flaws.  Installed "real" multi-piece built-up baseboards and crown moulding - only seen in mansions these days.  Also made the mistake of putting cedar siding on the house and using galvanized nails which wind up leaving gray streaks, so had to set and fill every nail hole before painting.  I loved doing the whole thing (took several years by the way), learning so much, but don't think I could do it again at my age.  So I will watch you guys and gals with all the new materials, tools and accessories and enjoy vicariously.
My husband and I refuse to hire someone to do what we can learn and do I'm the nerd hes practical but together we make it work we've done our master bathroom and our livingroom now we are doing the kitchen and dinningroom if we can do it I have faith that you guys can do it just remember mud less is better and don't go across it too many times it pulls the tape off but if you have lots you can sand (I do the mudding because the hubby has a heavy hand and I have to sand it while he's at work )
Love you guys! So funny and such a perfect couple!
Another great video, you guys make my week! Such chaotic, fun, infectious energy. I hope your back gets better soon Eamon!
PLEASE tell me you'll be restocking your hoodies and other apparel soon.....
You just need to measure the height and width like Eamon said, the problem is that the height and width need to be at a right angle :)
I’m so impressed the way Eamon backed up that trailer! Awesome!
Haha I love seeing the contrast in weather! Here in Australia we are doing vanlife but it is SO HOT! And over with you guys it's snowing and cold! Please send us snow hehe. Love your channel guys keep it up! You inspired us to start making videos :)
Like said below, mudding is easy. Thin layers that is the trick. And don't stress about wave lines from the edge of the mud blade. Mud every thin. Dry and sand (knock) high points. Mud again. Sand high marks. use wet cloth to wipe down dust. Look for pin holes that need to be filled.
That’s what makes y’all such a good team! Brains and brawn. 😉😎
What can’t Eamon and Bec do?!?!?!
every time I see your vlog I regret not getting a sweater bring them back!!!
Can i live with yall ill help mud lol
Cannot stress enough the need for insulation on ceilings!!!
Omg...that was great.  I can’t wait till next week so I can laugh some more.  Keep up the great work💕💕💕💕
i think your supposed to use special screws with little green circle things, drywall screws i think theyr called
Great Job On the Drywall!!! When putting your tape on the joints, us stickey back.
Always love the humor - thx 4 the laughs - Solar powered backup camera for $100 will help u line up that hitch
I had to pause the video to say how EXCITED I am for the podcast to be back!!!!!! 😁👍🏻😁
Don’ do it!  If you mud an it isn’t done correctly you will always see the seams and it drive you crazy!  That is one thing to pay for  to have a smooth finish. We built our house and in part we tried to do it ourselves and it was awful!  Had to pay for someone to come in behind us to fix it.  Cost more than if we had just had them do it to begin with.
When they were all saying "Nay" I thought Eamon & Bec will do it, Yeay!!!  (Smarties!)
Taping the joints and corners is not too difficult. The key is taking the time to do 3 coats with good sanding between coats. Resist the urge to go thick and try to sand it smooth. Put 3 thin coats and sand each smooth. It’s very dusty and hard work but it can be done well if you take your time. Get the right tools also. The final coat needs to be installed with a 12 inch trowel to assure a smooth transition at the edge of the mud.
Nice job, just take it slow - measure twice cut once. Eamon your hair looks so much better - well done Bec ....
take your time to mud and tape and also do not sand a damp sponge will do a great job if you are careful with the mud and will only need a very light sand do one room first and you will see how not to use too much mud good luck
You should watch DIYferent - they do a lot of drywall in their home improvement series and I recall him explaining a lot of what he did. There’s a variety of episodes where he does it - here’s one: https://youtu.be/pO-hm-h1tL8
If you guys watch a few videos on kidding and taping it can be very simple my first time a few years ago I was terrible I recently re did my room and watched some videos and did pretty good I’d recommend mesh tape over paper tape tho and make sure you have the right mud some are made for use with a power sander but good luck guys! 💙
When doing sheet rock you want to stagger your seams it helps with the strength and to lock things into place. Also when you do the taping in the mud make sure you don’t go heavy on the mud on your first coat you shouldn’t even have to sand it if you do it correctly then the second time you add a little bit more mud and that one you should have to sand lightly and you should be ready to go.
Wish ye guys uploaded 2 a week !!Great job with the dry wall 👏
Hire a professional for tape and mud. If not done correctly no amount of paint will hide the imperfections.
Yaaaaay! You did it. I love watching you conquer new things. I have Mondays off work so get to enjoy my Eamon and Beck every week with my morning coffee. Perfect way to start a day off. Happy week from Australia
I would do it, you have the worst part over
Long time watcher, love your channel!  But Eamon please don't feel left out, we really miss seeing Bec in a bathing suit!!!!!  We are ready for you guys to find a warm beach somewhere in Canada!!!!  lol
i have to know, how do you guys do the drone shots while you’re driving? do one of you get out while the other controls the drone??? i need to know!!!
Put Insulation on your inside walls!!!!!
Y’all are amazing!!
Anytime I see Bob...i know some dad wisdom is about to be dropped.
Just a FYI, Your drywall corner should be staggered. Also mudding isn't that hard.
hire a taper trust me
Taping....easy. Mudding...omg...u need alot of patience...thin layer, let fully dry, thin layer,let fully dry, repeat, repeat...its not rocket science. It'll bubble,drip, or crack if u layer it too thick /wet. Y'all got this...I have faith...yall have tackled some difficult projects and u are artistic creative people so i think u will have the right touch to pull it off like pros
👏👏great job !! ❤
Get someone to mud!
I’ve done DIY drywall lots of times. Last time was when I remodeled my bathroom and replaced all the plumbing. (I was 69! And I am a Great Grandma). There are cheap drywall screw bits at your hardware store.  They keep u from putting the screws in too far and breaking the drywall. I like the self sticking yellow drywall tape. Then u can tape it all. Then mud. And you don’t have to do both in the same step.  You need to bed your tape w a thick layer of mud. I use a 4” rounded edge drywall trowel; to put first layer on and then a 6” to push it in and remove.  Flare it out at edges.  The next day; Sand or use a damp lightly any ridges. And to flare any thick edges. Next layer I put on mud w 6” and wipe off w 8” trowel. Next day sand lightly any too thick and ridges. Put on skim coat w 6” wipe off w 12”. Sand smooth BE CAREFUL never sand into the surrounding paper or you’ll have to sand your primer paint! To knock the ruff off.  Suggest you do spare room first and get your technique down. Then other rooms. Living room last as that is the room everyone will see!
Where's your dog?  I thought you two recently adopted a rescue dog?
I worry (and laugh) about the things Eamon does and screws up. A lot! Haha. I'm thinking OH MY GOD LET BEC DO IT. But hey. But dude... what's with the hat? Lol. The peak is straight as a board and tilted slightly up lol. Men don't wear their hats like that. Lol  Watching it on tv right now. Every once in while there are more laughs. Thank god Bec is there!
DON’T DO IT!  A good Taper can fix a lot of things and make your work and effort look even more phenomenal!  And they are done in no time!  Not saying you can’t do it but God love you more than me and I built houses and remodeled enough times to know when to say enough.  On the other hand,,, you two are so damn entertaining you might offer a good giggle or two, or three...
definitely go ape shit with insulation, esp ceiling and roof. better too much than not enough. no heat leaks!!
🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦 welcome to #Morocco ❤❤🔥🔥🔥
best part of the entire week!!!!
Look at Mr. Bob rocking that facial hair &  beard ... looking debonair.  🧔
No way they still have a life is good store, I thought they were gone !
Can I just say, I've binged watched every episode in probably from the past year the past couple weeks.  Long time fan, love you guys!
Mudding...just watch Jeff on home renoVision DIY ... he has a series on it that taught me 🤪😊
This was fun.
Oh wow you've done a great job! You'll do the mud and tape easy x
Not too shabby! Taping, muddying and sanding is what drives you to drink!  😎👍
AWESOME JOB!!! You already have done the hard part. Muddy and tape is easy to do!!!  Just make sure you let it "DRY"!!! THEN SAND IT.. Make sure its nice and smooth.... YOU BOTH CAN DO IT!!!! Good luck 👍💓 THE MAN THAT'S TRYING TO BUILD-UP MY CREDIT SCORE FROM INDIANAPOLIS 🇺🇸
You can easily mud and tape, just be ready for a lot of really fine dust.   Move everything out of the room before sanding.  It gets everywhere.  Wear a dust filter mask.   You can also have someone hold a wet/dry vac under the sanding block to help collect the dust.   Don't get discouraged after the first coat; each subsequent application gets better.   It can take awhile to dry if it's cold (which appears to be the case at your cabin), so count on some time between each coat.  My husband and I have drywalled several rooms and done lots of patching.   It's actually kind of fun.
Mudding and taping is just patience and practice. Start in a less noticeable place. Your drywall work is so good. Contactors were not born knowing how to mud and tape.  You are both more than capable of doing this. The cabin looks awesome.❤
Don’t put the mud on thick, just thin layers. That way you don’t have to sand as much.  You will do fine it is not as bad as some people make it out to be.
Love this channel - it makes me anxious and makes me cringe all in the same breath. An E&B ‘how not to do things right’  book would be sweet.
See you Sunday!!! 🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻💃
Not crazy to drywall, but you got to be nuts scrapping away insulation with crowbar and no mask on. Not healthy.
good job guys! nerds and buddys!
Love that little town! Start with the taping and mudding in the spot you’ll look at least...it’s one of those things you’ll probably get the hang of with practice but at first, woof. You could also try on a bunch of scraps first! Warm up and get that muscle memory going! Good luck!
Lee got faith in ye  🙌😅
Great job guys, after you mud n tape, don't sand, use a wet cloth to do the job.  I wish so bad I didn't know this.  SO SICK OF REMODELing ... MUST TRAVEL.
Seriously hire someone!! Drywall is hubbys job, mudding and taping, mine....sanding....someone else
Don’t forget to stagger the drywall next time. For strength and seams they make the panels offset kinda like bricks :) .... also ughhhhh drywall. We just built a whole tiny house .... refused to do the drywall ourselves lol
Eammon you need to put a jockey wheel on your trailer.make life much easier for you ☺️
That wire should’ve been secured along a stud and not floating in the middle of the wall.
At section 2239 I’ve noticed a live wire floating in the middle of the wall behind the sheetrock. If you pound a nail in there to hang something you will kill that wire or hurt yourself be careful
Drywall is easy.  Watch a few youtube vids.  YouTube channels like Home RenoVision DIY...he's in Ottawa...or Vancouver Carpenter. I just put up 45 sheets of drywall in my basement.....didn't do the ceiling because I will drop ceiling that sucker. You mud it and sand it.  You're good to go...and you save a ton of money.  You can eat an elephant, one bite at a time.  I can't believe Trent isn't going to mud....no way.
OMG!!!!! I recognize the so called "sleepy town Hollow",   which is really Westport Ontario.  My parents rented a cabin on Bob's Lake, for 30 years right there!!!,  also saw Wolfe Lake.  Never realized how close you folks were to where my family vacationed.  LOVE WESTPORT.   did you walk down to the waterfront in Westport to the bow bridge & yachts??  Across from the post office is a green brick building, use to be a 5 & dime......your hardware store use to be a Canadian Tire many years ago,  The Cove, was the one & only hotel....thanks for the memories. 😉
We need the long hair back ASAP.......
my advice on mud and tap.. invest  in a quality pan and knife.. the goal is to make a smooth seamless transition from one sheet to the next.. its not easy and might need to be fixed several times.. so the cheaters way is to texture the entire wall.. a pan and knife texture is simple and only requires inconsistent strokes. the goal is to hide the tape and cover the screws.. after it has dried you sand the rough surfaces and ridges, then paint.. just a warning.. closets are a great place to start until you get the hang on it.. if you don't have a closet practice with a spare sheet of drywall or plywood till you have a method you like..
Stagger the butt joints (4' end of sheet) so you don't have a seam that is directly above the other to eliminate the possibility of cracking and having a harder time finishing the joint.  The other way to make the butt joints easier to finish is to buy drywall shims (thin cardboard strips) that you put on each stud the other of where the butt joint will be.  This will give you a little bit of a dish at the butt joint so it is easier to tape and finish.
Me and my late husband built our first house ourselves and we did the drywall. Wasn’t bad. Just take your time and sand sand sand. Lol.  Love that you asked Trent on his opinion 💜💜
Westport! Such a neat little town! You guys gotta check out foleys mountain, especially in the fall :)
You guys should knock down the wall that’s between the master bedroom and the guest to make a bigger roomy room for the both of you
You are indeed crazy... But you are a crazy lovely couple!!!! Keep on the good work... Hugs and kisses from Portugal...
Did you use glue behind the dry wall???
Last post. Your crazy. Mudding and taping is tough and messy and if not done well, leaves a lot of sanding which will cover your entire house and everything in it in a fine layer of white dust. 🤔.  🌞
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Z5IT08P01o&t=464s
Hire a professional!  This is a critical step in the process.  Good luck!
Why do you guys sheet from top to bottom?  In Australia we sheet from bottom to top and work from the corners to the door/opening cutting the openings out.   It saves alot of time and stress! Any mistakes get covered either by mud or skirting/architraves
The montage of Eamon trying to connect the trailer had me ded! 😂
Good job!  🌞
I am both happy and sad that I no longer think of you as a man bun and bec
Drywall is easy! Mudding and taping is another story! 😉😅
Mud and tape is well within your ability. Buy the ready mixed compound. If you do it well there should be almost no sanding. Vancouver Carpenter has excellent tutorials https://youtube.com/channel/UCbZdXox6mKHdcT2QdVT-goQ
In the guest room, if you start laying sheets on the bottom half of the walls first, you can rest the top portion of the drywall on top of the bottom half while you screw it in to place. 🙂 Looks like ya figured it out! Great job, looks good so far!
You two are so cool.
Life Uncontained is putting up dry wall in there tiny house maybe you can get a few pointers from them?
Get yourself a jockey wheel👍
Happy Sunday! :D
Umm, bottom up. Not top down. Carries the weight of each sheet to the floor so is not on the fasteners which as you can see, is through just paper and chalk. 🌞
Heck yes you should tape & mud. Practice on scrap pieces first to get the consistency and flow that you want and then go for it! YOU CAN DO IT!!!🙌🏼💪🏼👍🏼
GO CHECK OUT YouTube Channel "Vancouver Carpenter" for tips on how to tape and mud!!! One of the best drywallers I've ever seen!!! I've been in construction for years and i could tell ya a bunch of short cuts... but he'll show ya...plus, you might be able to collaborate with him via Skype or zoom or something.... worth a look!!!
You are great on diy! Do you plan to paint it after?
Go to Mexico? Pass
Funny story... I left this comment first on Nomadic Movement channel ...  it was for you...    The main goal with mud to to try to avoid sanding,  use thin coats .  Avoid ridges and bumps ,  if you apply it neatly you avoid the worst part which is sanding.  Use different size taping knife for each coat.  Working from 6,8 12” knifes for each coat,  plan on the mud being about 12” wide for each seam.   Alway pull your knife along the seam.. not across,  using long strokes in the directional the seam...  it is temping to try short strokes across the seams but is is much harder to control that way.... 3 or 4 thin coats are much easier that a lot of sanding.
Oh my gosh, A FREAKING VAN?! how could I not make a donation, it was such a good cause and price for alot of entries 😍 keeping my fingers crossed!
You can mud and tape no worries 👍🏾
You guys should have took down the wall in that guest bedroom so you can make the master bedroom a nice size bedroom. That would have been so nice
You are great on diy! Do you plan to paint it after?
Can't wait to see what muddling is. I guess plastering in UK. If so good luck!
You can definitely  do the mud and tape,it's  ok at first not fun as you go. If you can afford hire. Installing  sheet rock is easy pease
Putting up sheet rock is easy, but mudding and taping is another story. My husband and nephew did the drywall and mudding/taping in the kitchen, and it didn't look good (still doesn't). I put my foot down and insisted we let a professional do the sheet rock/mudding taping in the basement. It looks so much much better. The guy we hired to do the mudding and taping was flawless.
Eamon, I hung rock in CA after high school. Hanging the board is easy. Measure, mark your line, score with a drywall knife, bend, score paper on bend side and snap back. Clean up the edge and install. Screws should just dimple the paper. Do no screw all the way into the chalk or it will not hold. Hire the taping and mudding out. Those guys are artists. Its tough to do and messier than you can imagine. Have fun! 🌞
I love mudding and taping! Wish I could be there to help you. It's easy and you will do great! Good luck!
Insulation    Insulation  Insulation     Insulation  noise  and   warmth   & cool
I did mudding and taping for the first time this spring and it wasn’t too bad!!! Don’t let people discourage you haha, you can do it, especially having done all you’ve done so far!! Having the right type of mud tho helps it spread and sand way easier!! My fave is CGC Synko dust control drywall compound. It comes in a purple and white bucket! The Home Depots and home hardwares in Alberta carry it!
depends on what kind of texture u want on the wall ...have fun w it make it all old world style
Make a L
Here it is                |.                                               1.                      S    |.   Put a piece of plywood behind stud and screw it to stud ply should be 5 inches wide that way it makes your corner solid do this one up and one down  I hope you understand this
need a wheel for the front of the trailer.... avoid lifting.
Eeehhh if anyone can do it my money is on you both! Just do ittttt!!!!! 😃 Now about your give away!? 😀 ✌️ ❤️
I also am a sucker and will try anything if there is a Youtube video showing me how to do it 😅  I spent my summer renovating a backyard office and drywall was by far the worst part but I did find this series to be the most useful: https://youtu.be/7VpzUYln8g4  It really just comes down to practice and patience. It's not rocket science just hard skilled work.
Great job.  My husband put in wood/laminate planking floors this summer.  His back and knees hurt for two months.  Hope you get that massage soon.
The wall and ceiling looks really good!  I can't wait to see the finished cabin, it truly looks like a labor of love😊
You guys are inspirational 😄 I’m sure behind the scenes you had your moments of 🥵🤬 Bahaha  Keep up the awesome work, love watching show. 👍❤️ love you guys x
You can do it! Compared to cutting those triangles... a piece of cake! Get dirty! Love mud and clay. I even sculpt with Rock Hard Wood Putty.
How come Americans and Canadians never use drywall glue , it’s the drywall glue that holds it , screws can pop
I love it! Can't wit to see you next Sunday <3
I Love Sunday's with Eamon and Bec You guy's are Adorable ...
Eamon you need a chiropractor and we need a segment where we hear your cracks 🤓
Personally, I enjoy drywall
You made me cringe when you cut the back side of your drywall first! Cur the nice face first to avoid tearout. Also when you install the drywall, alternate the joints so you don't have long joints from floor to ceiling, since those butt joints are a bit more difficult to finish. For taping and mudding, go the Vancouver Carpenter channel, I think he explains the best how to do it. If you follow his instructions, you can make a great job, both of you are great!
Where did you two fabulous beings meet at first? This stuff is golden. 🥰🤗
Eamon next time you find a corner like that you can slip in two short  pieces of ply wood in the corner attached them into the existing stud I wish I could show you it’s  a easy fix and works .
🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦
where can i get Eamons head band/ hair band??
Yall are funny! Thank you for the video! See you Sunday!😃👍
Put the trailer on a log,  It's much easier to hook it up next time.  Just saying 😁
Nice job with the sheetrock! I've never done a big mud and tape job but I think you got it.
It'll be nice if this black family wind this time. I'm just saying 🤷🏽‍♀️
DO NOT MUD AND TAPE YOURSELF! Hanging drywall is the easy part. It is WELL worth the expense to hire a professional for the mudding/tapping.
The amount of sanding you have to do is rediculous,very messy, and very time consuming. It is really a learned skill. If you can afford it..... Hire a pro! Goodluck it's all looking great!
If u can dry wall, u can definitely mud n tape 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
Why did you not insolate the ceiling?
Sr engenheiro  arquiteto e esta linda modelo e linda princesa muito guerreira gosto muito de voces e teus video
Dont skim/mud/plaster yourselves. The finish of a pro is so worth it. Trust me. Ive been there. Took me hours to do one room and it was awful. Professionals had it done in half the time and it's so smooth and nice.
You know the border is still closed ,don’t you?
I love you guys ,  i put thumb up before i see even the video cause all your videos are amazing and inspiring and give me energy . Keep making those amazing videos
After hurricane Harvey I learned how to sheet rock, mud and tape, then add then finally add texture.
My husband and I mud and taped our bathroom. It looked amazing...for about a month. Then the dry wall lines started to come out. Not sure if we needed to sand more or what but all the lines started to show. We had to then hire someone to come in and fix it...my advice...just call in the professionals the first time.
So do you guys not have building codes in Canada?
Dislike because you played rap
My partner’s dad has built quite a few houses himself and every single time he’s paid someone to do the drywall 😂 y’all made it look easy though!! can’t wait to listen to the podcast tomorrow!!
❤️ Trent and Allie😊
Gewoon proberen, zo heb ik het ook geleerd. Maak het zo dat je het ondersteboven kan houden, zonder dat het valt.  Oke, ik heb wel bouw ervaring en 2 bouwbedrijven in de familie.  Dus als iets niet helemaal lukt, is er altijd wel iemand om op terug te vallen.  Groetjes uit Spakenburg, Nederland Gerben T
You two are so incredible. I hate it when your weekly video ends it’s the highlight of my week. Take care xx
That soup looked great what was in it?
Pretty confident y'all can do it ... just watch some videos. The toughest part is blending and sanding. Use some chair rail around the top to hide the seams between the drywall and the wood.
you guys have it, this dry wall is like cutting ply wood. tape a box up is the same as tape a wall, just use the mud to make it stick ! you guys have it ! love your show..  marky mark
I love your orange bedding, where is it from?
You guys already did the hard part , I trust you to do the taping and the mud 🥲😂😂😂
I would never try to tell you what to do, but... Here’s my mudding/taping experience. I built a closet, drywalled it myself and mudded it, too. Not a perfect job, for sure. I will hire it done for the rest of the house. It IS harder than it looks!
PROCRASTINATION NATION made me think of our Congress here in the states!  HaH! Why do 2day what we can put off till...whenever the heck we feel like it...OR...NEVER!  Thx 4 the vid guys. Y'all make me smile, laugh & cry. 😁🐒😁
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH...
Nha looks like you guys are doing ok.  Give the tape and spackling a shot.  Just just just above the ceiling in the guest bedroom, don't you want any insulation up there?  Was the poly-carbonate for the windows on the porch expensive considering there's been a lot of demand for it lately?
I had figured out your layout before this but it wasn't easy ! Well everything except that second bathroom surprise.
I’d recognize Westport ‘Stars Hollow’ in any video 😂 very cool to see you guys living around there!
I love doing drywalling. Yes the taping and muting can be a headache especially if you want the flat wall finish.
Subtitulos en español por favor 🙏
Oh what I'd give to get a van. ESPECIALLY during lockdown.
As they say, "Measure twice, cut once!" #NerdsRule! Loving the videos!!!! Your property looks like a WINTER WONDERLAND!
Can’t stop watching your vlogs I am addicted to you two, both are so inspirational love ya 😁😁
😘😘😘😘😘😘😘
"The sympathy level is so low with you " 😂 Bec is tough as nails, no nonsense when she's around 💗 love it
What the news about your van in morocco ?
Eamon, sorry about the back dude.  Hurt mine 20 years ago bad enough to end up in rehab.  Still twinges on occasion.  My go to is Robax Platinum.  Basically Advil with a muscle relaxant.  Take one before bed and awesome by morning.  I find once my back is aching my muscles tense up fearing the next twinge.  A little Advil with muscle relaxant allows my muscles to relax and let's me heal quicker.  Stretching slowly and exercise help a lot too.  Good luck!
Hubby and I remodelled 50000.00 worth of damage for 25000.00 this summer after our basement flooded. We did everything ourselves including drywall but subbed out the mud. Social media is the best way to find someone local on the cheap. 1700 for a journeyman to do 1000 sqft. Best part, done in three days.
My husband is a professional metal framer and dry wall hanger..... He doesn't tape or mud anything.... Finishing drywall anyone can do it..... But if you ain't a drywall finisher you will be able to see EVERY mistake bump and uneven spot.... So much easier and faster to hire finisher.
By the way I did it for a living
Drywall itself is relatively easy (Eamon’s and my back aside). Taping and mudding ... well have fun you two.  You should survive. How well you enjoy it...?
All the snow having melted off your roof suggests you need some more insulation up there...
I'm 99% certain that there was blood on that craft knife  while you was trimming that plaster board (drywall board) but whose was it ?. Great job guys loving it.
You guys are nailguns
Where did you get your sunglasses Eamom. I really like them
I think you should use the wedded tape instead of paper tape. 🇨🇦😇
I agree with Elaine and Nancy. If you can insulate between the walls I would do it. Our bedroom and the kitchen share a wall.  Every time my husband bangs around in the kitchen it’s like he is unloading the dishwasher and putting the dishes away right over my head, cause he is. Sound proofing insulation would have been a smart thing to do.
Why would anyone say that plasterboarding is 'too hard'? It's not rocket-science. I've never seen the point of plastering after you've put the boards up. Just tape the joints and smooth them then paint it all. Jointing compound is a hell of a lot easier to use than real plaster because you can sand it easily. Well worth 20 quid a bag rather than 6 for the versatility. Any fool can get that right. Takes a while, but so does everything. If you do decide to try and plaster it you'll find that actually plastering large areas and getting it flat needs real practice. It's about the only DIY thing I've found hard. I still DIY but your first few goes will be pretty crappy and you'll have to do a lot of filling. Also _never_ try to use plaster that is significantly out of date (a few months is OK, but not years). It really does go off way too fast to be able to get it smooth and flat.  I would have put so much more insulation in that place! You just seem to have 3 or 4 inches(~100mm) of foam in the wall. Nice and airtight, but it's proper cold where you are: twice that much would be appropriate. Glad to see some attention to airtightness though. Overall it's looking pretty good.
1:25 I need these sunglasses in my life 😱. Where did you get them?
Good job guys
We did a whole extension on our house ourself and the mudding and drywall was the worst. My only hint is not to put too much mud on. If you need a second coat later once it had dried it better. We made that mistake and it took forever to dry before we could sand and the the sanding took forever, and the dust from sanding was so bad. It gets in everywhere.
search you tube how to drywall
Lol he said “ 🏃🏻UUUGGHHHH “
If you guys don't hire out and try it yourself I would say just watch a couple videos on how to tape and mud drywall
What is mud and tape from an ignorant UK person.its gyprock not dry wa
So far, so good. It ain't rocket science, but it's a tough job. The worst part is the dust when you start to sand the mud down. Make sure you have a good shop vac and keep your camera and computer gear sealed up - that dust gets into everything.
Hi Eamon and Bec from Melville Saskatchewan have a blessed day
See y'all can do anything together.. I  love it..
Eamon-I see you are using a reg Phillips bit to drive the drywall screws ,.there is a special Drywall  bit you  should use,,it's a Phillips bit with a collar on it,when used it properly sets the depth of the screws so that when you mud and tape the seems it won't show the screw heads.In the closeups the screws looked flush with the board.Hanging drywall,mudding and taping  easy.The chore will be when use sand the seems after putting on the mad and tape,..Lots of dust.
Fascinating. Guessing dry wall is jib and mud is plaster. Just finished plastering my son's house.  Wow new products like premix and the awesome corner trims make it a satisfying and much easier job than the last time I did any plastering ... ouch must be thirty years ago.  Learnt from my mum as a child. Have the right tools take your time. It's fun!  Sanding helps hide  imperfections. Wallpaper also but I've  painted son's  house. It will be my last house renovation don't have the same energy levels...buggar! Oops New Zealand 'oh dear' word not a swear word.
Good Job
The thumbnail...Bec is so beautiful 😍
Can you do the taping and mudding, sure. However, a pro will have it done in a couple of days, it'll take you a week, it won't look as good and parts of you will ache that you didn't even know you had!
Drywall tips- -When taping you must make sure there are no air pockets behind it. -Sanding sucks! When applying final topcoats of mud "go thin to win". You can always add more. -Nailers, these are the boards you will use to screw in the drywall. Sometimes you'll find theres nothing to screw to. Like when you drywalled the duct 😉
Just take your time with mudding and let it dry all the way. It's a bit of an art, but very satisfying when you're done!
I wait all week for Sundays to see what the new project will be. Love watching your journey, but why didn’t you insulate the ceiling in the guest bedroom? Wouldn’t help keep that room warm and also with noise?  You guys are doing great , love eating your channel. Do you have plans to get back in the van when your able to travel again?
Whoaaaa! You’ve a couple orbs around Eamon’s legs at the 13:25-13:31 mark! Who lived in this house before?
You may want to drywall then clad the ceilings, in that room you just did, if you ever need the ceiling down for wiring or if you get a leak, it will be trapped up by your drywall.  Small wood trim round the edges after final coat on the drywall and it will hide the ends of the boards. Also, plastering (as we call it in the uk) been there tried it, EXTREMELY MESSY and looked awful so I would definitely hire someone to do the top layer as it will look like a hand finished garbage
Love Trent and Allie
My dad taught me and my husband how to mud in like 5 minutes, it was super easy, and I think it looks good😜 He did the taping though 🤔
Personally I only make bone broth soups unless u have something better
Why aren’t you insulting the rooms?
I spent the start of this video going “what is drywall and what is muddying?” I’m in Scotland, we call it plasterboard and then you tape and plaster it. 33 and just found out what drywall is....every days a school day
As a full time drywaller and taper for 10+ years, I can appreciate your struggles. Nice to know my profession is still needed!
Bec's last outfit reminds me...who won the merch sweater?
Great job on the drywall!! So awesome to see the progress each video! And again on point with the wicked transitions and editing 😃😜 always love the music you guys choose 😃💜
As a CONSTRUCTION WORKER myself, the work you all are doing is 98% INCORRECT and I will be quite surprised if you PASS INSPECTION! BAH! HA! You two are obviously way to stubborn or just plain stupid to be doing your drywall yourself, as you just asked your family and friends AND 99.999999% of them said ***NO!, Do Not Do It Yourself*** Then you IGNOR BOTH DADS (That Are Our TEACHERS In Life) that said NO - then you decided to listen to 1 person that is NOT a certified dry-waller. BAH! HA! HA! HA! I hope you're both ready for a ton of FIGHTING, ARGUING, BACK PAIN, SHOULDER PAIN, NECK PAIN, MISTAKES, EXTRA COSTS FOR ALL THE REPLACEMENT SHEETS AFTER YOUR MISTAKES-HAHAHAHAHA Good LUCK-LMAO!!!
Is Trinity still in Africa??
Sorry about the State of emergency but I'm sure yall will make good use of your time. Be safe and healthy.
You guys make a fantastic team!
Omg you’re giving away another van!!!!! Thank you. When I win it I will give you both free readings!!!!!
Totally do the mud and tape.  It’s really messy.... really messy.  But it’s not hard.
Good one guys. I recognized the area this time. Shopped there many times. The village green is a great store. 🙂
i want to enter the giveaway but i live in belgium and i can't enter :'(
You guys are getting goofy
You guys kill me with how often you are out in the cold in swimsuits, even dipping in the pond. This sixty-something thinks you are nuts!!! (Shhhh... I am actually jealous.)
This bloke is awesome at explain muddying and taping drywall.  https://youtu.be/3T7vu20Ac5Q
You 2 got this 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👍👍👍👍☕☕☕
Walmart doing trifle that good on you trying to do it just take them at the kids are they seems before Martin the lot
Don’t try to mud and tape yourselves if you are going for a flat wall. If you are ok with imperfections and “character” though you will be fine with enough sanding... good luck!
My bf will literally do everything in the house, but won’t do drywall because of how easily it can be messed up lol!!
You guys are living the DREAM!
Hire someone to do the taping and muddying says my hubby! We’ve renovated a few houses in our time and that is a job for pros. My hubby is great at everything BUT mudding. Even though he sanded in between, I still saw the mud through the paint after. It’s because it’s so labor intensive that you get tired and just want it to be done. Hence, laziness. And lumpy walls.  Good luck!! Cannot wait for the next episode. Love you two!❤️❤️
Those chickens, nothing wrong with drywalling. Don't forget the corner protectors.
Looking good :) you're both such hard workers x
You don´t even bother to get some workoutshoes on, gotta love it. ❤
Can you guys make a 30 minute workout video?  I would definitely be inspired to "use it" as this pandemic has made my life more sedentary 🙄
Song at 05:53?
U need a pet lol
is dry wall what we in the UK call plaster boards? if they are then its pretty easy really ... i live in a timber frame house and plaster boarded my house a few years back .. only needed the help of my brother and dad to help lift the weight .. so seems us females are right lol .. its easy ... as all the gents in the video said 'no get some one else to do it' and the only female said 'yes go for it' ... i rest my case lol
We built I would say 70% of our house and the one thing we hired out was the drywall! You guys rock doing this! You can of course do it. Suggestion from a mom...I would insulate the wall between your room and the guest room. If it becomes a kids room in the future they don't need to hear what mom and dad are discussing through a wall. Someone told us to insulate all the walls of the master and I thought it was good advice.
yall are pretty fake now, but im sure the money is good, hope it's worth selling out!
💎BEST TIP EVER: from a guy at my local wall paper store: - use the non-woven wall paper glue (instead of the mud) to attach all the strips that goes between the dry walls. Much faster and a splendid result. Mud as usual after that.
good luck with all those butt joints!! Can't wait to see the trials :D
Lol, you should have called my hubby😁. He did his own drywall... he says you can do your own drywall!  No problem. ( side note.. he did our upstairs drywall before the kids 23 years  ago when he was a buff go getter and i have never before or since heard anyone swear, bitch and moan that much since his drywall adventure.... now he is still a pretty tough old goat handy man....but his memory is gone 😉. I remember him saying never again back then..... and really trying to decide if i really wanted to marry a 'do it your selfer' . I did, but everytime i watch Trent and Allie i have traumatic flashbacks to redoing that first house! ) 25 years together later,  my empathy for his aches and pains and injuries is null❤... i let his health care team do all that hard work.
Be like Trent and Allie and just own it: "Just a hair out of square!"
Just started listening to your podcast...LOVE IT!! I’ve been trying to find one that I’m interested in and finally 😆😆
Do it. Not much that can go wrong or is not fixable later ... soo yeah. Have fun
Nerd 😂
I helped put the drywall up in my garage but we put insulation under it.  It looks good you guys are doing a great job.  Eamon & Bec  are  talented in building the inside of a cabin.
Lookin good guys! You’re doing a great job NERDS! You two are complete NERDS but you luckily possess super adventurous souls. I’ve been watching you since this summer....catching up. Lol. I CANNOT get over you two NERDS in SNOW! 🥶 Take us to 🇲🇽 🏝 🚌 ☀️ 🥥 🧘‍♀️ 🧘 ✌🏼 🍴
Eamon! Where did you get those glasses from @3:39? They look so cool!
You should insulate between studs for warmth and noise reduction
Why did you do full walls in two it’s normal to do them in full sheets
I say your both doing a fantastic job. Yes do the mudding and tape yourselfs. Along time ago my dad, my husband at the time and myself completed our basement of our new home we built around we hung the drywall and it was my job to do the taping and mudding . i actually found it relaxing and sang while doing so. You guys always look like you know how to make anything fun , so go for it. Much Love from Bonnie S aka Lucky Warrior. ( Sorry it might say Linda Womack. Was an old roommate. We still share a phone account). Love following you guys journey.
Hey next time you need to hook up the trailer put one phone in the car and one on the trailer and FaceTime yourself
Mud and tape is simple.  I did a fine job the first time with no instruction.  You'll have an easy time getting it right.
Beans beans the musical fruit the more you eat the more you toot lol.  I know it’s not a fruit but a funny rhyme
You guys can do the mud and tape no problem, just take off as much of the mud as you can so you don’t have to sand it off because that’s a make a big mess all over the place.
Tape and mud- paper tape, thin layers of easy set (the bags of unmixed drywall compound) scrape off your lines before next layer with larger trowel and make thing as smooth and spread out as you need to avoid flashing.
Wow feel like you guys have taking the editing to the next level on this one!! Super excited for the return of the podcast tomorrow!
Loving the space buns bec👌🏼👌🏼
Fantastic- I have no doubt between the Nerd and the Bud, mudding will be just another hurdle you will conquer!
I didn't know that it was hard to tape and mud so I did it.  Okay it was a little wall below a bar.  Okay, someone else cut the dry wall.  And tacked it up.  Alright, somebody else mixed the mud around for me.  Fine.  Someone helped me stick the tape on and took the scraper/smoother out of my hand to smooth the mud.  And when it was dry, someone did help smooth the mud with a hand sander.  Okay maybe I didn't do any of the work.  Wait, I painted it after.  Well, the first coat.  Well, I was there anyway.  Perhaps I phone it in.
You guys can totally mud and tape! My dad is a contractor and taught me how to do it with the help of a YouTube video and we did my entire living room together!
Great effort Guys, Just one bit of advice, its best to stagger joints so your not left with joints that all meet each other, like a cross. These areas are known to pop after finishing.
7:20 that moment when Eamon doesn't connect his safety chains haha
are you still online? Love you guys. Do you use final cut pro or Premier for your videos please comment thanks sooo much
good job, but why dont you insulate over the ceiling in guest bedroom. u loose a lot of heat energy.
So bad ass! NERD GIRLS RULE, boys drool! LMAO
As a 23 yr old, I helped to mud and texture our first house drywall. It is doable, yet the texturing aka the sanding before painting took more time and fussiness than we thought it would. If two 23 yr olds with no carpentry experience could do it, so can you.
Omaze isn't available in Belgium
Mud, tape, sand, paint, repeat.  Ya'll could  do it, of that I have no doubt.  You just will not enjoy it.
I can’t get enough of your videos I want mooooreee !!! 2 videos a week ..?? Please
I always think you guys are calling a dog when you say "bud"
These videos are the highlight of my Sunday! Lake looks amazing covered in snow ❄️
Hire someone to T&T.  You'll be glad you did as you start painting.
Do it. Just be careful, start in a part of the house that is less important while you're learning, and USE THE STICKY MESH TAPE INSTEAD OF THE PAPER STUFF. Also use the big trowels and place them perpendicular to your seam once youre done - if there's light showing anywhere, you don't have enough.
Taping & mudding drywall:  Been there, done that. Hate looking at the imperfections in my bedroom. Professionals make quick work of it. Worth the money. Not worth the hassle for a DIY. Part with the money. Or ask Trent & Allie for some of the extra cash they have laying around! 🤭
I recognize that town. I only live 30 minutes from there, but haven't been in forever. Lots of great little shops.  Can't wait for Covid to be over and all the little shops in all the nearby towns can open up again. Be sure to check out Perth when they do. And it's a little further away, but Merrickville is nice too.
Evening Eamon&Bec, firstly I was impressed with the trailer reversing.. No easy task, and the plasterboarding went well I thought! (with help from the nerd!) always listen to them! Might be a British thing but is the mud stage what we call plastering!? I wish you the best of luck with that, but think you've done exceptionally so far! SUS! Health@Happiness 2U!
ur vids are the hightlights of my fucking week!
Yeah I might have like 80 videos in my watch later playlist, but do I always check out y'alls new video every week first? Heck ya
Swede here! Love you stuff, long time fan of your travels :) Drywalling is very comon here in sweden and most "home-renovators" do it themself so you can defenetly do it!  The mud and tape is the most hard work. Lots of sanding! Recomend good sander to ease the burden. and it get s very very dusty so cover stuff up. Also a bit late advice, perhaps for the bedroom, but we sometimes put a sheet of plywood or similar behind the drywall so if you want to mount a shelf or whatever you can just use woodscrews and dont have to use drywall plugs. And dont skip the tape, crucial to prevent crack. Keep you amazing content coming! <3
When you work as a team ,you can accomplish anything.😉
Thanks for the chance to win a van!!! I've been hoping to have a chance to win a van and this is the perfect time to do it
don't tape and mud!
The difference the drywall makes is amazing! You did great!!
Drywall I believe you put the bottom piece up first then you can rest the top sheet on that.
I think you should put up some wood shiplap type thing for the walls. It would go with the cabin vibe more.
Enjoy watching your journey... But why no insulation in walls and ceilings???
We'll just ignore the code violations.  Two that I've seen so far and we still have 5 minutes left in the video.  LOL
Y’all .... I can’t explain my excitement when y’all started doing the mic check and put your headphones on. YAAAAAY! I can’t wait 😁😁
Hi, long time fan.  Just had a question? Why aren't you putting insulation in the ceiling. Is it because you guys are by the water?
❤❤
Stagger the joints buddies... otherwise 'Great Job'
You are both  nuts but nice nuts. John UK
Lee is the best 😂
Good job guys
I've done it in three houses and I"m an accident looking for a place to happen.  On two of those houses, my girls helped.  Then they got too cool for school and worried about their nails.  DO IT!  (Although,  there would times I thought hiring a pro to do the taping and mudding would have been a good idea) P.S.  You don't need no stinking protractor.
WARNING! If you don't want sheetrock dust on it, cover it. Even then you will have it everywhere. Mudding, taping, and especially sanding drywall is one of the messiest things you will do, so be prepared. Also, when putting up full sheets, stager your joints. Have fun.
Also the fact that Eamon got that rash from the hottub means his immunity might be low. Read up on the nutrients you are missing from a vegan lifestyle. Read up on B12, choline, taurine, Coq10. Even sufficient calcium and iron. And those are just the ones we hear about. There are probably many more micronutrients we haven't named. You will not get them in needed amount from a vegan diet. You need to eat at least a little fish, and maybe some eggs, to make up for the short comings.
It's the drywall for me... 😂😂😂
You will do good on the mud:))
Everyone also told us not to drywall, mud and tape we did it and it’s actually not that bad you guys are more handy then the average joe so I’m sure you can it
Excelente.... Saludos desde Venezuela  Lamentablemente no podemos participar en el sorteo...  VanLife es nuestro sueño
Little  bump out wall build a bookshelf  by the window  side the curtains  rod be on that two the other wall  so looks bult in also
Mud and tape yourselves! My twin brother and I did it years ago at 19 years old in a wonky attic remodel with the help of a retired contractor friend to walk us through it! and it looked passable. lol. Youtube it. Ask around. You can do it!
What is the name of the song of the minute 1:15? 🥺
Are you’s having Tyler and Todd on your podcast?
Bec was very unsympathetic to Eamon's pain. Getting a massage and stretching are not going to miraculously heal an injured back. And an injured back is not something to joke about.  Also his 'flu' last week, which I guess was that hot tub thing, is also not a joke. I read it can cause fever and possible septicemia which can be life threatening. Laughing at people's injuries is not cool.
What a difference! Looking good!
The next 6 days of waiting are going to be pure torture. I'm so looking forward to the finished product!
If you're go on a do mud and tapping just watch a few videos pre hand ! Y'all can do just about Nothing you put your mind to ..from on Canadian forest dweller to another have a good day eh!
"is there anything he can't do" Go through the man's flu with dignity
I love those glasses Eamon.  They suit you.
Yah Trent n Allie are da bomb building their own house in the mountains
Doing a minimal amount of research, and actually following a few guidelines could have made this much easier and would yield far better results. That's not to say that I didn't enjoy the episode. I cringe at times , but I still enjoy. You do you.
Why no insulation? For cold, heat and noise control
Forget to insulate?
thin thin coats of mud
You can definitely do mudding and taping! Just it will take a month 😅😅. Vancouver Carpenter on YouTube has some of the best mudding and taping videos though, I cannot recommend him highly enough.
Fun to see that you are in contact with Trent and Allie. How often do you connect with each other? How about Luca and Sera? Do you know them since they also know Trent and Allie?
Looks like it's pretty cold building at all, how's temperature inside at the night?
I can't stress this enough, insulation is a big deal. Insulate between the walls and also insulate the ceiling in order to keep you warm in the winter and cool in the summer.
I really love this relationship🥺
I still wouldn't mud and tape even after staying at a Holiday Inn lol, Good job so far, check out this guy coincidentally I watched this yesterday, it's a playlist https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caJO1l0p6uw&list=PL_Aetb7e8ejzo0lucfWzu1TxvCl-IDro4
If you don’t use the right screws you will be using the right screws after many failed attempts
Very interesting to see u go without experience on dry wall...mud and tape is an art, let see if you will become muddy tape Artist.... pulling your way.....
Love it
hey guys, if you don´t mind some advice. About dry lining, you should do over lapping, it will prevent cracks in the future. Next to door jam, don´t place plasterboard just next to it all the way up strait, but cut over the door, at least to the middle, that will also prevent cracks coused when you shut the door and the stud on the lock side will shake. When boxing in ducts or pipes, in the outside corner use timber all the way from bottom up, it will be sturdier and better, again, to prevent cracks. Type and joint (as it is called in the UK) I personally would hire somebody to do it for me, even thou I have experience with it, but if I would want to do my house and want to have nice clean lines, would most probably hire pro. The think is, you might think that it looks nice, when you did it and send it, but once you paint it and light will shine on it, you will see every single uneven bit made either by sand paper, or trowel. And repair it after it is painted is gonna by nightmare. Never the less, if you decide to do it, I recommend to buy premixed mud, it might be a bit more expensive, but you will use every bit of it, meanwhile powder one, you wont use everything as when it starts to go off, it is hard to work with and you end up throwing out quite a bit of it. Not talking about the time you loos mixing it and cleaning bucket after every mix, as if you leave it with dry bits, they will fall in the new mix and will make marks as you trowel it on the wall.  Sooo, don´t want to rain on your parade, I just think that this might help you to get better. Good luck :)
I’ve mud and taped before and it wasn’t that bad. It’s kinda fun actually
SO good to see Bob!!! We miss you, Bob! <3
2 words drywall rasp.......Money!
What do you use on your head as the head band? It’s doesn’t move. All mine move
I'm new to your channel and I'm loving your  positivity. Looking forward to seeing your cabin take shape. No idea what mud and tape is but I'm sure I'll find out eventually. Love from England x
Use the right screws
Nice job! can't wait to see the dog on your vids :-)
Well y0ur young fit athletic, and prepared why shouldn't you dry wall, if you were fat middle aged and unfit probably not a good idea, but you did great i really enjoyed watching this
when you mud the first coat..taping..if you have big gaps, then add some plaster OF PARIS OR DUROC to the joint compound..it dries quickly so do, small batches..it can enable you to fill gaps bigger than half an inch and tape it in there..always, take off as much plaster as you can initially..unless you have a big valley, then you can start building up around the joint 2 feet wide with very large trowels...big trowels of 15 inches wide are the secret..initially, the taping is done with 3-4 inch wide trowels..but building up the joint well takes large trowels..The Pros hardly sand in the end because they scrape most of the excess off, then fill in the small knicks later..3 coats..know when to stop on each..>Have lots of Heat for Drying..some even install Fans.
Wear masks, and keep the door closed in the bedroom, or plastic off the living room area as you will get plaster dust EVERYWHERE when sanding. Easy - but laborious. You’ve got this!!
Your videos are so helpful at actually really explaining how every step works when renovating !!! Thank you guys love seeing you every sunday.
Canada is so beautiful!
Like how warm is it in there when it's so cold outside? Bec is almost topless. It's not much more than a shell.
Looks great!! Tip on mudding and taping. Take your time!!! Be patient!!
I think it’s awesome you guys are attempting this! It’s a great opportunity to learn a new skill, one I’m sure you will use again and again over the years. Just watch a few YouTube videos first so you can avoid the major gotchas. :-)
Eamon's trailer scene had meeee 😂 Too far bud... try agin... welp... one more time... oh my land
Your videos are so much fun! ...all the way in Bangor Maine!!!!! Love your merch too!!! ❤️
You want to throw a jockey wheel on that trailer. Will make it so much easier
Never fear to take action,  great job guys.
Dry wall is not that hard
ummmmm. that wall looks fantastic. hope you keep it white against the black. yipppeeee for nerds and cute boyfriends. xxoo
Doing good it's a pain in the ass but the only way to do it is try and do your best you kids got this
When there’s a new video from Eamon and Bec : 😁😁😁
You can do, just remember any extra mus will need to be sanded off. Light touch and you guys got it. Good luck. You'll need it. Lol
Dry walling is easy my dudes. When you plaster make sure you get rid of all the lumps in mix. And you will be fine. I HAVE FAITH. X.
Surprised your fire code that doesn’t require drywall under wood paneling, like on the ceiling.
Just do it! You got this
Just a few YT videos to watch. Of course This Old House should be first. But there are a lot of "how to's" out there. You solved your biggest problem by doing the lovely paneled ceiling. You've done the heavy lifting. Mudding just takes a little finesse.
Thank you guys for having coffee with me and making my day every Sunday ❤️
I would have knocked that wall down and made one big master bedroom.
WHO RUN THE WORLD?!? NERDS!!   Great episode you guys, officially the masters of the dry wall! Obvs buzzing to see Bob this week he’s such a precious soul and we just adore him!   See you Sunday ❣️  https://instagram.com/ytlegends2021
You guys are my favourite YouTubers and when I’m old enough to have my own home I’m living in a van just like yous 💗💗💗💗
Was that Bob's new winter look?
Thanks for keeping us motivated to keep pushing thru projects. Your engery level is contagious! Keep it up
You need to get a Coffee tamper from Andrew Szeto, He is in your neck of the woods. That being Eastern Canada :)
I am a little too happy that you know Gilmore Girls.  I had a heart attack a couple of months ago and have spent more than a little time daydreaming about chucking it all in and seeing the world while I have time.  Fingers crossed I can win that van!!!
The best part of the week is when you upload look forward to it every week thank you :)
Mate muddying is EASY just make sure you’re even on your mud thickness, don’t go over board on it. And get a good mask cause that dust can be intense.
THE PODCAST IS BACK?!?! Cannot wait for reroot!!
Good team work!
I still don’t understand why anyone would hit the thumbs down button on any of your videos ? 👍🏼
I look forward to your Sunday Post!!  Great job guys!
Fantastic job guys
That's why they call it Cry Wall 😭
<3
Looks good to me.  Mud and tape should not be too hard and have fun.  Stay safe and warm.   Walk in Peace.
is it me or does eamon look really good in a hat
BOB IS ALWAYS RIGHT!
Best money spent is paying someone to mud and tap. We will do small jobs but never again the whole house.
Eamon i love your smooth move when you turned around and snaped the drywall in half. With your hat on you looked like the guy on the Indy project. Another You Tuber. You are doing a great job on the dry wall work. When you do the taping use the netting typ of tape it has a sticky back, it's easer to use than the paper tape. When doing the corners, fold the tape in half the length of the wall ,and push it in the corners.Use a 6 inch wide trowell, using drywall compound apply a light coat to the area's and let dry for a day.Do not use rapit set compound for it drys too fast to work with it.Then on the second and final coat, take your trowell and just go over the dryed compound just to knock of the high points. Then apply the second coat of compond with a 12 inch trowell and cover a wider area than the tape.Its called floating the wall.Once it is dry you can lightly sand and your done.When doing the corners with compond take your finger and run it down the wall and it will give you a great finish.Use metal corner bead where two drywall boards meet, also after nailing them on tape and mud. Also use a compound mud tray.
I don't think your crazy!  Maybe a little cabin fever!  I've known people who did great jobs mudding.  I do recommend you make sure the screws are in deep enough!
It's so funny that you guys and Trent and Allie always loved hot climates traveling and both are building and renovating in SNOW
This is amazing one day I will also live in a van cause u inspired me a lot!
That’s crazy that everyone told you not to do your own drywall. I actually decided to do my own flooring for my bedroom and everyone told me that I shouldn’t do it myself either. I still did it and it came out great. Glad you two decided to do it anyway 👍🏻
Just did my garage as my first drywall experience. Found a tutorial that preferred paper tape but I found it to bubble a ton more than mesh tape. If you use paper, make sure to water down the joint compound so it really soaks in the moisture. As an amateur, I’m gonna stick with mesh tape going forward. Also, think about some sound proofing insulation on the wall between guest and master bedroom for...ahem....some privacy.
Eamon is going to be such a fun dad, you guys would be great parents together!
I say beans beans the magical fruit the more you eat the more you toot the more your toot the better you feel so lift em up and let em squeal
That’s funny that everyone told you not to drywall, but we just did it and it wasn’t hard to put up the sheet rock, but we hired out the muddin’ & taping & texturing. That’s what I would say definitely needs the experts. The sheet rock; yes, go for it!!
When you mud use the mesh tape not paper. I have seen paper give out. Also, when feathering the seams, if you can feel anything it will show up. Be patient mudding and sanding.   The drywalling looks great. Good job!
Spackling is an art. Get a professional in and have them do it .You will never get rid of all the waviness in in the walls . You will appreciate it after you paint the walls and everything looks clean and even. It’s a process that requires at least 3 days if you want it done  right.
Don't mud.
You guys are fearless.
Guys, Love the Cape Town shirt Eamon has on, love the weekly show love from Cape Town South Africa
You can do it.  Everyone should mud and sand at least once. Watch some mudding, sanding videos. One tip on mudding. Don’t put a heavy layer on the first time, you may have to sand and mud a couple times.
Yes!! Lee coming in strong with the support
Hi from Morocco 🇲🇦😊
Eamon you made me LOL! Love your hitch the trailer technic!! Good Luck with  the Dry Wall😂😂😂😂😂
Eamon gives me Jim Carrey vibes
Mudin  is fun , just look at U Tube first. Put it on in thin coats. Good luck.
Where is your bedding from?
I helped my dad do drywall when we were remodeling our new home, it wasn’t as hard as everyone made it seem. It was a pretty fun time helping him with it. You guys definitely got this. 😁
Like Craig said less is more also get 25 or 45 minute durabond a powder that you just add water to.mix it in tiny batches until you get good at it. Use a strait edge to check the height of your joints. Use joint compound only for the last coats VERY THIN!!!!. And don’t bother with knives wider than 10 inches/what ever centimeters LOL looks great have fun
OK let me get this? You ask all your friends ...including Bob the Builder (AKA Trent)  and they all say, "hire it". The one person who has probably never thought about dry walling says " yeah do it" you jump all over it. Seriously? Scratching head on that one.
I know everyone is talking about your drywall mastery but m here to tell you loved your glasses and where can i get a similar one ? 😅  Love your channel btw.
Living in a construction zone is pretty chaotic. Thumbs up for your effort, in both (re)building your own house, but also for living on that madness 😁  Cheers from Portugal!
Dang good job backing up that trailer.  In your cold climate, I would have insulated more and done the walls and ceiling in the guest room as well.  Every single bit helps.  But Great video!  You guys are great, and I can't wait until the world is back to normal!!
Take my word for it. Call a drywaller. I worked a lot of construction jobs when I was younger, plumbing, painting, electrical rough and finish carpentry and even concrete work. I tried drywalling and lasted less than half a day. Just remodeled my house and took most rooms down to the studs. Did everything myself but the drywalling. Call a professional dudes.
Every man needs a nerd 🤣🇳🇿
Great job with the drywall.
LOL I forgot you guys were on today silly me so excited to watch 🤩 love you guys ! 🤗
A couple of comments re the dry wall. Do not leave any drywall unsupported ie the corner with the 6" and the outside corner should have had a 2X4 all the way up so when you put the beading on it is fully supported. Next time you're at the Home Hardware in town get your self a "dimpler" it will give you the correct screw depth every time. Love your show....Marty
WAIT....no insulation????
GOOD MORNING BEAST EAMON BEC YOUTUBE VIDEO CANADA ONTARIO 🇨🇦🇨🇦❄❄☃️☃️
Everyone SHOULD fight through drywall at least once.... then be thankful to pay the pros to do it better faster on future projects  :)
Do it not that hard
Hey guys when hanging drywall, over and under doors and windows, make a seam over and under windows , and over doors please.  you'll see a difference.  In the long run you all will see a change,   JUST DO IT>  lol, but it is the way in an enviroment that you all are in, your house will move.  You guys are who we want to be be in a few years.  I'm old and still learning and just try to pass on my mistakes.
I’ve mudded and taped. It’s pretty straightforward. Mud -tape -mud. Take care in the corners (fold the tape). I did tape for outside corners, but you can buy metal corners which take abuse better. Y’all got this. Love from South Eastern VA
Wow this was satisfying to watch!!!
We are do-it-yourselfers too. I had to laugh when I saw all your seams in the walls.  When we drywall we try to lay out a sheet so we have as few seams as possible to mud and tape.  You’ll understand when you get to mudding and sanding.  This is so fun watching you do this renovation.
Good job at the drywall looks good.. Keep it coming....it,s a party to watch you guys on the sunday... See you next week.. Gr.from Holland🤪✌
If your very comfortable painting your car, I'd say go for it when speaking about taping and texturing your dry wall.  Remember it takes alot of work to correct.  But if you choose to go for it, set up a temporary fake wall in your porch room to practice on.
Hi, Bec
I think it makes it look less like a cabin and more like a home. Great job!
How do you guys feel about Tyler and Todd copying every tittle and content of your videos?
Mud will be easy unless your going for a level 5 finish. Can wait to go down to Mexico hope our truck is not to big :)
You just  did the very easy part of dry wall.
drywall is all about the math! If you have someone who can see it like a giant jigsaw puzzle, you're gold. Be careful with the tape and mud. Decide if you are using the tape or the mesh. Also - do thin layers. You can always add to it. If it's too thick: it'll take forever to dry; it'll be a major annoyance and pain to sand. That's all I got. Good luck guys
Get a flat box off ebay, use it, then sell it when you're done. It'll save you TONS of time. Seriously
My first house we did all the drywall.... you guys did great... next mudddddd /Sand time be ready for dusty hair😅 .. we were never good at  wet sanding.
Nice job drywalling💪
Mudding tip: be very patient, lots of thin layers.  Thick layers won't dry and will crack over time.  That's our best tip.  It takes lots of layers.......oh and the answer to "I think the texture will cover it" is NO, IT WON'T.  It needs to be super smooth before you texture.  Good luck guys.  We believe in you!
So Eamon got some new sunglasses that he rather likes!
put mud on in layers. Use three different width knives.  A narrow one for the first layer to fill the cracks between sheets, installing tape and covering screws.  Use a wider one to cover all the cracks in the first layer.  Use a foot wide one for a final layer which makes a nice smooth finish.
Holy sheet. Learn everything you can...things are about to get REAL. Stay safe you two
Love Love Love you guys!! Im officially obsessed!!
you guys did a great job......cant wait till next week.....
Leave to Lee for the positivity!!! Nice!
you could make coasters from all the cutouts of the recessed lighting holes! like all you’d need to do is possibly stain and epoxy
I thought somebody broke an arm.
I fricken LOVE you two !!!! Absolute Dream Scenes Happening !!!!x
Leeeeee! Gotta love the friend who will tell you what you what you want to hear!
You just finished the easy part. Hire a mud guy for cash their expertise is invaluable. Plus (a biggie) if you do it yourself there will be drywall dust throughout your WHOLE place for weeks, yuk.
Eamon, I think you need a jockey wheel for that trailer.
only 1/2 crazy... sanding while living in space is well... horrible!
The sanding of the mud is the main annoying thing because that fine dust will permeate the house and the ductwork and take a good while to get rid of. Put up plastic tarps taped tight to try to minimize spread and always cover the heater/cooling vents so it doesn't get in there. Just use the fireplace for a bit for heat til the dust settles from the air. It's not that drywalling is hard, but it's messy. Also you'll have to texture the walls and that is very messy and annoying to get right. Good luck!
I’ve been mudding and taping sense 13 :) y’all got it!!!
everyone says the little beans jingle differently, I always said it "beans beans the magical fruit, the more you eat the more you toot, the more you toot the more you fart, beans beans they make you smart" I like yours better 😅
Yaaaaayyyy!!! So glad the podcast is back!! :)
I renovated my whole house last summer , like gutted it, and the one job I hired out was the mudding and sanding.
Always love watching your Sunday vlogs! You two can totally tape and mud, just start small, figure it out and get it done as you always do.  💕
Thin mud
do the walls first. Then the ceiling it will cover and short cut you do.  No molding needed.
Love u  guys thanks for sharing
Good job guys!!! Doing the "mud" is the difficult bit though, so you may want to get someone in to do it for you. With practise I'm sure you'll be able to do it, but it might be a frustrating process getting it just right. But hey, that's just great content for us so crack on!! Glad you're both doing well. Stay safe!!! Hear you tomorrow and see you next Sunday.
"Professionals" hehe! Awesome!
Check the Home RenoVision channel. Seriously. It's not hard, but it's messy if done wrong.
tip 1 Don't do it
LOL you guys actually make me laugh out loud. "Collaboration of nerds and smokers pit 🥬"   Thanks for making me smile!!
Hire it out... unless You’re not real “particular” about the result....
My husband and I are 64 and 68, still remodeling houses and we do the drywall along with everything else so you sure can. Its boring work and takes patience, the more you do it the better you get so start plastering the closets and back rooms. Most newbies don't buy the proper drywall knives, add too much plaster and then have to sand too much. If you watch a pro do it they put on several very thin coats of mud and use a larger knife every time and hardly have anything to sand.
I'm a 69 y/o retired ad exec and lifetime homesteader. Family and friends have always called me crazy so be crazy and be happy ... I am!
TRENT!
Awesome!! Good job, just getting that wallboard up and it starts to look like a real house!! Yabberdabberdoo!!!
I’ve watched your work and drywall’s a snap! No problem! And you have a helper from heaven! My helpers always seem to have a disgusting plumber ass crack when they bend over! You are truly blessed!
Small tip,when drywalling always do the bottom of the wall first so when you do the top you can rest the sheet on the bottom one,if that makes sense.
Just made my day happier!  : )
I love you guys, but please don't tell people to go to Mexico or the US while we're in a pandemic.
Where did eamon get he’s shades 🕶
My dad made me mud and tape my own room when we renovated it, I was 18. You can figure it out ;) But I would recommend covering your furniture. The amount of dust when sanding is a big ooof
Are you guys going to be doing van life again year? (if things go back to normal)
Your awesome!!!! It looks great!
Doing drywall is easy. Doing drywall well is a whole other story. As an electrician I've seen plenty of professional drywall companies do an awful job. Only one company in my area does a truly great job. Good luck, take it slow and steady! As long as you're happy with the finished product that's all that matters!
Excellent job guys. Congratulations. Eamon when are you going to the barber shop to fix your hair? Look so funny. Take care guys
Haha I love you guys ❤  I entered the contest! I never do this stuff, but I feel like I have a great chance of winning!!!
I will enter every contest !!! My DREAM!
So, the shot UP EAMON'S NOSE .... nope.  I'm out.  I need a break.  Why?!
😆 that's funny! 10 ppl said don't do drywall, yet you've chosen the advice of the 1 person that said, "YAYE, go for it!!" OPTIMISTS! I'd have done the same thing!! 👏
Don't tell anyone I said this but. I love mudding and taping.  Just be patient, it takes longer than you think, but worth it for the feeling of satisfaction you'll get.
drywall is easy and mud and take also..  painter marcel
I just hope your high school math teachers don't see this😅😅. But who cares?? The podcast is back😍😍
do  a textured knockdown  finish, smooth walls are so hard to do when the rooms out of square, plus it will hide any small mistake that you made. roll it on with a big furry roller and use a 6 or 8 " knife to knock it down, looks great and goes fast, one with the roller and one with the knife same time. If I could send you a picture you could see my place and see how nice it looks. Go on line and check it out. I did all the drywall in both my builds.
You can do the drywall... Mudding and taping is the hardest part, but if I can do it, you can definitely do it!
Gr8 job with the drywall
tape the closets first, by the time you finish the closet you will get your taping technique down.
OMg I love your version of Stars Hollow!!  also, sheetrock is the absolute worst.  We get asked to do it all the time, and we always try to get out of it!!
Bec where did you get this cute sports bra ?
Ya’ll are doin great job. Just remember no mud fights while taping.
My dad does drywall for a living and when I showed him this of y’all FaceTiming friends he was laughing😂
i enjoyed this.  see you Sunday!
I had so much fun watching you  two young nerds hehehe. Keep up the good learning time together. “Make mistakes and learn from it”. Thanks for sharing your fun.
I’m always so gutted when it ends! See you Sunday! Well... my Monday... I’ll see you then!! So cool about the van giveaway! Too poor to enter even haha but man that’d be amazing!!! And would for sure have a layout like your latest ones. Genius!!! Have a great week guys and that dry wall looks amazing!!! Good on Lee for telling you to do it cause you both did awesome! Listen to the nerd with the protractor!!! 😉😂
I just love you guys
Beck, where did you get the black puff scarf? Thank you!
Just an fyi, when hanging drywall, work upwards. The first sheet hangs close to the floor, about an eighth or a quarter inch off the floor.
Great job on the drywall! 👍🏻
What kind of ladder is that??  I must have it!!
if you still can, insulate interior walls and floor to deaden sound
Good job you two! 👍
Beans beans, are good for your heart, the more you eat the more you fart 😁 💨
Hey I'm thinking the mud and tape can't be that hard...? A guy hired my ex and taught him how to do it in a day so that he could work ahead of him measuring, hanging, making holes etc.  "It can be messy.", I think he said, but he got good at it fast. You might want to practice with the consistency and not make too much at once?
How is it that I want to watch your videos even if it’s only drywall installation 😂 what has my life come to. 😂 love you guys. I love Beck’s attitude always. I wish I was more like you but I’m Latina and I’m feisty. 😆
Yeah nerds 🤘🏼⚡️
Eamon, cool t-shirt... I'm watching from Cape Town :)
I appreciate 1:39 to 1:45. Slow mo to sped up, back to slow mo, keeping the truck in frame, using the music at the right time... idk, that shot just excited me! Well done🤓
I KNOW WESTPORT WHEN I SEE IT!! So happy you two are in the hood :)
You are craz you make about $ 2 US dollar and hour in Chicago vs hiring a Mexican drywall
Excellent job guys 😊❤XO
So far this is coming along awesome and keep up the great work. From what you have done so far it adds value to the place. I am so proud of you guys. Se ya next Sunday. Love y'all
Can't travel to Mexico right now...(fly in or out)
stay thin and skim...  3 coats to totally cover is actually easier in the long run, lessened sanding for paint prep.    Nice job guys :)
What is the song at the beginning?
The problem with drywall tape and mud is the dust from the sanding!!! It will get everywhere. Tradesmen know how to minimize the amount of sanding and the gear to contain it.
Thick is better when you mud 🥲 learnt that the hard way
Not bad. Did your best.
OMG that first scene is 101% canadian 😂😂😂
“today we tackle the TriAnGLe” 😂😂. You two are hilarious and this is the realest renovation series currently on YouTube - very inspiring, so thank you!!
I remodeled my mother-in-laws kitchen without an prior experience of drywall and it was pretty easy.  Watched "Home RenoVision DIY" drywall videos and he explains, mudding, taping, corners, etc.  Watch his videos and you'll have all the knowledge and then you just gotta go with trial and error my friends! :) You guys are a huge inspiration and hope me and wife get to meet you one day!  Going to start my tiny house build soon and document the whole thing!

The sun won't get you ANY D3 in the Winter! You can only get vitamin D that far north from about March through September. The sun angle is too low in the sky. It has been proven scientifically, you can look it up. Most everyone is low on D3 due to modern living indoor, sunscreen and more clothing, plus bads chemicals in our foods. It's best to get a supplement with K2 because that keeps the calcium, which D3 helps to increase uptake, to go into bones and teeth and NOT into you arteries where it stiffens them and causes problems.  Do NOT use D2, it only does partial benefits and has some bad effects too. D3 also has way benefits than most drs or even other health people realize, but too much to put here. But, this is a good starting place. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74F22bjBmqE
sleepy hollow, SUPER LOL!!
most mudders won't do drywall that they didn't hang. You're probably going to have to finish youselves.
I coulda watched for another half hour! Way to go guys!
Love the fact that you both just ‘jump in’ and get it done !! And why not .... you may expose all these hidden nerd Talents you’ve been hiding ....😃 and it’s your cabin ... if you really screw up , you can always call in the professionals , and tell them it was the original home owners ‘that did that ‘!!!! 😂 love your cabin build !!
Where did Eamon get those Awesome Shades....I want a pair
If you can build a van, you can drywall. Go for it!!! Plus, Trent needs to learn from your mistakes.  Lol
It’s not as hard as everyone says.   It just takes time if you aren’t a pro and have all the expensive tools.  It can be done with simple tools.   One tip is to whip up the drywall mud.   It makes it go on more smooth.
You guys say “Ja” like proper South Africans(Afrikaners). Same with Braai!
Brilliant episode!
I think Eamon just needs to except the fact the Bec is always right 🤣 love you guys 💞see ya Sunday
Buenas vibras para el resto de su semana, los amo <3
My husband and I have done drywall and it's not super fun but I have no idea that people were so against it. 😶 The sanding sucks though.
What’s the brand of ladder? I need that. I’m single. Fix things. Need something easy to maneuver
Song ID @5:55 anyone?
Awesome! So excited for the podcast to be back!
you should try   Tissue paper walls  you still to tape and mud but you don't have to get it perfect  looks great   try it on a spare sheet of drywall  check out   how to enhance walls with tissue paper  i would recommend folding tissue like accordion  and tearing the edges before you crumple the tissue  good luck
Bec! What are your favorite workouts? Vids? Thanks for the reply!
If you guys want things to be perfect then hire someone.....but if you dont care and just want finished walls then do it yourselves. Most times when a person does their own projects only they can see the faults. So I'm sure it will look great either decision you two make. Things are looking fine so far, I think.  Good luck with the rest!
If you are going to mud and tape you are going to have to sand that stuff too.  That dust gets everywhere so my suggestion is to get a bunch of inexpensive plastic sheets and partition off your dining and kitchen area so that you don't have so much dust getting into everything.  Of course if you are good at doing the mud you won't have to sand very much but I'm thinking you are going to have to sand quite a bit being new to it.
Taping and mudding is easy but time consuming and dusty. Cover thy stuff.
You can do it! I believe in you more than Trent!
Looking great! and Yes, drywall is a bitch.
Can I take part if I am in India I wanna have a chance to win a van
Thin layers of spackle, let it dry, sand lightly, and repeat.  Repeat about 3 or 4 times. Good luck.  I know you guys can do it.
I think you guys can do it don't listen to the neigh sayers. Power on looks great listen to the nerd 🤓
Gooood white wall job😂👏🏼
Your joy is so refreshing! 🤗
When you said stars hollow I was STOKED!!! Loooove Gilmore girls and love your episodes just as much!! Such amazing content
omg Gilmore girls yes!!!!!!!
Taping and mudding drywall is not that hard to do. It's just time consuming. First you run your mud down your joints and then you lay your tape down your joints and then you mud back over it let it sit and dry overnight then give it a very light sanding and then you get a wide spreader and then you spread more mud down the joints let it stand and dry for 24 hours then give it a light sanding again and then you repeat the process for the third time and then you want to make sure that you send everything flush on the third time and all your screws you do the same thing you just mud over it the screw dimples let it dry you were like sanding mud over them again give it another light sanding after 24 hours do it again for the third time process is all done like I said it's time consuming and it's dusty from the sanding. You want to make sure to use drywall sending screen is designed for sending drywall.
Mud and tape is actually pretty easy, we had no experience at all and I think we did a pretty decent job. 😅
Woooow   !!!   Excelente trabajo, muchas felicidades. Saludos desde Zinacantepec, México,
Insulate  between the bedrooms.  It won’t regret NOT hearing what people are doing in the room next to you.
Plastic. Lots of plastic to prevent the white powder of doom settling on everything. Cover door openings to every room. Mud is easy after webbed tape, then sand, Remus, sand Remus, sand and finish, easy peasy. Lots of sanding blocks too.
I don't get the naysayers.  Tape and mud can be an annoying and time-consuming job until you get the hang of it, but it's not that bad.
Looking good!  Definitely concur with many other comments about mudding: thin layers, dry/sand between.  Also, if you have any wide seams, put some mud in them, let it dry and sand level before applying the seam tape.  This keeps the tape from pushing into the seam and gives a smoother look when finished.
You tube has a great drywall video mixing key put it on generous then use  your blade with good pressure and smooth!
Everyone: HIGHLY RECOMMENDING NOT TO DRYWALL  Eamon & Bec: challenge accepted 💪💪
OK. The sarcasm has reached its end. Easy part. Have fun.
I can help with some partner stretches for the back, if you’re interested!
I hope to one day have projects like this when we move into our own place! Thank you for letting us learn from your trial and errors 😂 keep it up!
Long drywall knives, thin coats of mud, dry wall sanding pad with pole, cover everything with plastic, the dust gets EVERYWHERE.
Always loved the bean song. My dad had a pen from a company that processed beans and their logo on it was "Beans, the tooting fruit". I thought that was the best logo as a kid.
Its so beautiful over there!! I'm in the UK saving up hopefully to move over with my own van one day! I love watching you guys and can't wait for more episodes ❤
I have to have that latter
No one should be afraid No one should be afraid to put up plasterboard, it could not be easier! Measure, cut, adjust, screw ... and finally, putty and grind, done! But I was a little worried that you did not insulate the ceiling in the guest bedroom !!? All roofs and walls must be insulated, for the sake of sound insulation and in your case, the retention of the dear valuable heat.
We've drywalled 2 houses ourselves. We always hire a professional to do the mudding and taping. Save you tons of time and frustration. The cutting and hanging of drywall is the easy part! Hire the professional!
Where’s Mossa?!
Looking good it is coming along, So proud of you two!
Nope nope nope ....    all men are babies sorry but they are!
You're funny hilarious adorable and pretty interesting to watch without feeling bored and wanting to change the video...   I guess this is what happens when you're soulmates.. Less drama and lots and lots and lots of fun what makes life Happy fulfilling and awesome ' Thank You for NOT being boring .. Never change and always be YOU..  Love you BOTH ..  STAY SAFE !!
Is there no insulation in ceiling? Or sound proofing
Not a big deal. Just do it. You can always sand.
Hire out the mud and taping.. You two are amazing and so capable... but that job is a b**** to get right. Plus prepare yourself, drywall dust gets into and on everything.
CRAZY. HIRE SOMEONE AND...GET A MASSAGE!!!!!
I got 5 on it, they hire someone for mudding.😁
E &B drywall company 🙂
lol...love the opening!!!
The Gilmore Girls reference had me 😍☺️
Me and my husband renovated a tiny house/ workshop few tips and drywall the first time like we did !!  - fiberglass tape is easier to work with if you are new to taping - quality small and big (1ft)  drywall spreading knives and an angled mud knife for corners are essential  - use a flat trowel tray to scoop mud onto the wall  instead of a bucket, it is easier to hold and work with at a moderate pace and easier control and how much mud you put on your trowel. Like a paint pallate.  if you do use a bucket get a metal one, not a plastic one - wetter mud is easier to work with ( not to wet or it will drip, you are looking for between play dough and thick soup ) but some cracking can happen, you can fill in cracks for the  second layer.  -  you can create a stronger joint if there is a small 1/8th of an inch between panels because it gives the mud something to grab in to. Works great when you dry wall a ceiling as well.  - we highly encourage proper PPE when sanding the mud when its dry, open a window, use a respirator, the dust gets everywhere!! Not good to breathe in or get in your eyes.  - if you have any large gaps between panels do a layer of mud first to fill it in, smooth out, tape and then do your second layer, sand, and then a finishing layer.  - drywall over screws! Its easy to forget. - try to keep the mud clean, try to make sure there's no dry specks in the mud or it will come out bumpy.  - if you have something bowed out and crooked like a door frame you can use the mud to build out the wall/ door frame to make it level, and smoothed out with panel edges to make it a clean look.  - painters tape off any edges  you don't want mud on like a window, if you do happen to get in on the window you can clean it off with hot water. Putting tape down first can help save time cleaning!  - mud takes multiple sessions, layers and takes time, don't do it all at once. Leave time for every layer to dry! You will be fighting cracks the whole time and will come out looking sloppy.  - Take breaks during drying to avoid pain for arms, hands, wrists etc.  - other than all of that ! Watch alot of professional videos on YouTube for more tricks and tips, it saved our butts when my husband spent hours watching YouTube(:  I hope this helps guys!!! You're awesome and drywall is possible! Doing it yourself save so much money instead of hiring someone to do it. I had to help and share cause we totally remember the struggle! Let me know if you have any other questions that I could help you answer! (:
Wish you would insulate the interior walls!  Better for sound transference & it holds the heat & and cooling better.
Am I the only one that doesn't think doing dry wall is that bad? lol I would do dry wall any day over doing anything on a roof.
yep, the dry-walling part is actually FUN (as you saw). Like making puzzle pieces fit together. You two did GREAT! The taping and mudding... not so fun. But doable. Maybe watch some YT vids on it and you guys will prob make it thru. But someone who KNOWs what they are doing with experience can make it go by SO FAST, and the first time. Something to consider.
I love you guys SO MUCH!
King & Queen back at it again. Good luck on the drywalling Eamon, with Bec helping you should be alright. Later
🥰🥰🥰
Wtf that guys is the same winner check Gone with the Wynns !!!! Looks bad....
Changed my mind...your music changed...don't like that fast rap type music...enjoyed other music though.
Another great episode, love your pared back lifestyle in the cabin, there’s a certain freedom to it that’s missing in a traditional house. Good luck with that drywall taping 🤞🏻
I think do a trial of mudding and taping in the guest room first. You may want to hire someone to do the "triangle." Although, I think Eamon would get a kick out of using stilts drywalers often use.  I'm concerned about the old dry wall. When we remodeled an old home, we learned that we should have used primers over the old, unpainted drywall. We wasted so much  wall paint and time because the old walls just sucked it up. When we finally started with primer to seal the wall, the wall finish went on beautifully.
Sanding can be done with damp sponges to keep the dust low.
Great video
Unless you are experienced at doing tape and plaster, it is better left to a professional. you may be the 1 in 1000 person who is a natural... or maybe like 1 in 10000... but odds are definitely against that. The problem is, the quality of the plaster finish is what you are going to see. You can do as good a job as possible on everything else, but if the finish on the plaster isn't good, that is all you will see for year to come. And trust me, once you prime/paint it, you will definitely see your mistakes. I hate to be negative, but you also have left yourself a lot of butt joints from the looks of how you hung the drywall. These are no sweat for a professional, but they are much harder for a do-it-yourselfer. I am speaking from experience here... I do absolutely everything myself... everything, except plaster and tape. If you want to be pleased with the finished product, invest a small amount of money and have someone who knows what they are doing finish it. Just a hint, most guys who do this will also want to prime it, that is when they will see their mistakes and go back over to fix them. If you decide it isn't that important (the finished product) then good luck! Either way it looks a hell of a lot better than when you started.
Do you ever plan on expanding the cabins size to create more bedrooms/office areas ?
I love the videos so much makes my Sunday!
Mud and tape is no thing! It just takes time, lots and lots of time. Like icing a cake 👍 A dry chalky vertical cake 🙄
There's not a lot of things that I don't do but the thing that I refuse to go anywhere  near is drywall and mudding you guys are brave to do that. My dad has done drywall and mudding and it's grueling and easy to make mistakes. Best of luck.
If you are going to dry wall . Watch all you can on you tube about dry walling!
TIPS from been there - done that - many times : NEW mud and tape. Proper tools. A "V" trowel is a good tool. Self adhesive tape is helpful if you have the budget. And necessary for small goofups and gaps / plugs Small and large spreader trowels on hand - and maybe a square "hawk". ( hand held platform - mud holder ) THIN COATS. Spread out over multiple days is easier than KILLING yourself - your lungs - your arms and filling your house with dust.  Thick coats will crack anyway and then require deep sanding and redoing it. Frustrating. Time consuming. Proper temp and humidity ( if possible) in the rooms - for the drying periods. You might consider plastic sheeting the room openings before sanding. Dust will go everywhere - and into other rooms. Have a wet dry vac on hand with good filter and working properly. Proper masks and even eye coverings for sanding stages. Close tubs tight if any left over - or use all remaining in tubs. CAREFUL if doing mudding / taping / sanding on ladders up high. ( Scaffolding ? ) or at very least an "A" frame type ladder - or ladders with wood beams to stand on ( homemade scaffold )  IF using days old mud - add water and mix thoroughly. And simply skimming off top dry portion works.  Rent a lift for ceiling panels if full sized. And lastly - get a few DRYWALL BITS with a concave holder mechanism. They are like $ 2 or less - and are incredibly helpful. And stop drill from going too deep.
Drywallschool.com and less is better! Underfill and more coats is better than days of sanding. Get covers for all the furniture and such before sanding bc the sand will literally go everywhere.
Love tuning in every week! You guys are the best!  Where do you guys get your music from?
eat meat
They make a taping and muddling gun if you will that helps put the tape down. Also make sure to let the mud to dry between each application. And sandpaper will be your best friend in getting rid of the extra mud!
Lol you guys are not math people
Totally agree Bec - if you’ve offered multiple solutions and he isn’t helping himself then what are we going to do 😂🤷🏼‍♀️
Loved the video. Y’all are such fun.
After watching Eamon and seeing our similarities. He’s helped me realize I could make our pantry bigger, but then I remember reality, I don’t have the tools nor help of the legendary Bec. Maybe I should buy a house in Canada... without a Canadian citizenship
Drywall is one thing, SERIOUSLY HIRE A TAPER AND MUDDER. Not the messy thing you wanna do in your own home, you'll be cleaning mud off of everything in the house for weeks to months, the same with the dust. Oh and on the dust from sanding the mud, which has to be done atleast 3 times before the surface mud goes down, J**** my shoulders and back are killing me just thinking about this, back to the comment: Get plastic drop sheet and tape a space between the walls and the room to try to keep the dust controlled. If you weren't living there at the same time this wouldn't matter, but the damn dust makes a mess for YEAAAAAAAARS. Go and buy a really good wet/ dry vac that your prepared to toss afterwards because the dust can kill vacuums really easy. SERIOUSLY, HIRE SOMEONE FOR THE TAPING AND MUDDING.   BEC, Don't give Eamon any choice in this or you'll be  physically dragging his little boy ass out the door, down the stairs and into the truck physically. Taping and Mudding and Sanding are the absolute worst parts of construction. Painting can be painful too, but, it's easier to control. Taping and Mudding/Sanding, NOPE. Leave it to someone who is okay with abusing themselves.  The drywall is looking pretty damn good for a newbie. But it does help to have a nerd around to figure out the tricky angles and cuts. Bec wins on that one Eamon. Hahahahahaha!!!!  Keep Safe All, Peace, Happiness, Love and Laughter Always, Matt
hire someone to mud and tape!!!!!!!!!!!!
Yeh right you snoozed off sunbathing on the deck with all that snow around half naked.
Hey! I love your videos so much! I have noticed that Bec does a workout using only weights. I was wondering which workout it is. xoxo!!
Lol literally everyone is telling you not to do! And the last one was right if anyone can do Eamon and Bec can!
Drywall is the easiest thing in the world. Mud and tape would be the tedious part. You can use a tile sponge to help with the edges. Just get it wet wring it out and wipe the edges so you don't have a lot of sanding, it goes a lot faster. Make sure you stir the mud before use.
Cabin tour?🙏
Do IT!!! Really it's not that bad. You just need to do a little at a time. And go fast is
Omg... this is exciting! 😁😁 a dream come true!
Such a refreshing couple. Love you guys.
🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🤝🤝🤝🤝🤝🤝🤝🤝🤝🤝🤝🤝🤝🤝🤝🤝🤝🤝🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦
Thin, thin coats or you'll be sanding your butts off. You ain't seen dust till you see dust from sanding drywall. I remember it actually ended up in my ice trays. Good luck guys
Awww living in New York city having to deal with the most unneighborly people. Winning that van will be a dream come true.👍 😍🙏
Absolutely wonderful!!
" bookin" it into town with Eamon and Becs
If you just hung all that drywall successfully, you can mud! Haha I helped drywall a house and ended up having to go back and make sure the screws were not sticking out. Take a paint scraper and go across them and you shouldn’t feel the screw! I learned that the hard way! Mudding is messy and putting paper or plastic on your floor is smart! You guys are awesome! 👊👍👍💪💪
Love how you two will tackle the impossible.  Wonderful outcome and well done.  Now ...on to the taping and mudding....that's the fun part !
My dad is professional drywaller. Now he just finished but he’s up in his late 50’s now. He’s done it all over the years... he’s been dry walking since he was 14. It’s hard work and even with him as my father and seeing it done my whole life I wouldn’t try to do it. Stilts terrify me!
Phillip is right... unless you have a ton of experience go thin! 3 passes at least.
Even if everyone tells you don't do it,Eeamon has back pain,man flu the show must go on jejejeje
And when you do any corners you have to do one side first let it dry and the the other side
It ain't a fit night out for man nor beast - Nothing wrong with one horse towns as long as they have plank walkways 😊
another banger of course
You will totally succeed in the finishing just remember the less mud the less sanding 3 coats and each coat is thinner than the last. You do that by thinner mud. Lay tape = 6" knife first coat 8" knife then 10 then 12
The fact that Trent is going to have someone mud and tape should tell you it’s going to be very difficult. I’ve done it myself. Lots of cursing. Lots of crying. Lots of sleepless nights. Feels like you will never get it done. Feels like it never ends. You are going over it more than the amount of times it takes a professional to do it. I’m telling you... you should take the advise of everyone who you called and don’t do it. Pay the people who do it professionally. You will be happy in the end and there are so many other things you can do in your home that will give you satisfaction that you did it yourselves. Look at what you have done so far. You are both amazing. Watch the professionals and take pointers, try something small in the basement later. Don’t kill yourselves now in the main living space.can’t wait for next week. Have a wonderful day!
I love seeing your channel evolve, I think I found you guys around 20k subs.. I came across your video when you went to Banff and I was like “holy cow they are only 4 hours from me” 😂🇨🇦 you guys gave inspired me to try van life one day!
a^2+b^2=c^2
Bec!! What are your boots? Where can I get a pair!?
I had to remove the snow and ice on the sidewalk so I am really tired.
Oh anD the drywall square is the perfect width of a outlet box so when you hang it on a sheet theres your measurements and width laid out for ya
I don’t understand, why is drywall considered more intense than any other aspect of the build that involves carpentry?
min "19:22" Eamon is graduating
Too short! Love ya!
I love drywall!!! Especially the mud!!  HATE sanding!!!!!  Also, Eamon "just going to grab" the trailer!!!!
Good job just do it ..... watch you tube videos on how to tape and mud then bam 💥 you got it or hire a GREEK guy 😂
After having watched you guys do the complicated things building out your van.....you definitely got this!
I don't usually enjoy the sponsor spots, but yours was so fun today!!!
Do not mud and tape. Drywaller can do the whole house in one day and will look good forever. Save yourself some grief...hire a pro!!!
Good job on the drywall so far.  My son and I hung drywall in my basement.  I have done a lot of home reno over the years with help from friends, even electrical and plumbing so I have been thru the insanity of home reno.  I HIGHLY recommend hiring out the tape/mud portion of drywall.  It truly is an art and requires more skill than you would think.  The sanding alone can drive you mad.  This is one job that is well worth the money you pay out especially if you want a smooth finish on the walls.  Its super hard to mud a wall to a smooth finish.  Texture hides some mistakes but not all so if you mud yourself, you might consider adding texture.  Good luck to ya. ;)
Well done, you got tonnes done. More power to you, you both have an amazing work ethic.
Goodluck y’all!
I NEED to know the 411 on those glasses Eamon!
Stud adhesive people. Your going to have lots of cracks at the joints without it.
With mud. Thin layers is best. You might have multiple passes but thin is best.
Not crazy at all! We all have to learn some how. My husband does dry wall for some projects on our house.
Next time you guys on road,,,, try to visit OMAN,,,, im sure you gona love it
TAKE IT SLOW YOU WILL DO FINE
Greetings from Switerland!!! Love your videos soooo much <3
As far as I'm concerned, it's not the tape or the mud, it's the sanding afterwards! Best of luck.
Bec sounds alot like Loreli from GG lol
Taping and muddling isn’t that hard. The first couple times until you get the rhythm of it. They do make equipment to make it easier. And make yourself a deadman to help hold it up is really a great idea. I helped my dad when I was 16 do our whole house.
The best way to do it is hire someone that knows what they are doing!!! It is worse than grouting tile!!!
Bec: Always cold  Also Bec: Bikini in snow
Quick tip- the reciprocating tool you were using to cut out the outlets (on my site we call them fine tools) work amazing when taking spray foam insulation off of the face of studs. You guys are awesome! Dry walling isn’t fun, but you’ll get used to it. 👍
Great job guys!👏✋👊 and I was going to say "listen to Trent"😜🤭🤫😏 can't wait till next week!
Some advice for the muddling. Go easy on the mud , less mud less time sanding .
Great work, but where is Bob? Missing him 🤣
I did drywall Myself, (we call it gib in New Zealand) Its not fun. Expect lots of sanding and when you are all done that it doesn't look good. my hot tip would be that you can't cover it up with paint so make sure it prefect before you paint it.
Oh Bec! They're all like that! My fiancé will complain about the worst pain and he will still refuse to take medicine or go get it looked at 🤷🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️
I told ya I do the tape and mud for my own business and I'm in Ontario. I work and can sleep in my work sprinter van. Also near Toronto.
Hey bec where did you get the sunglasses?
“Nerds rule !“🤓Love you guys awesome job. I think you can do it .
Love you guys!!!!
Who runs the world?
Bec! where are your boots from? thank you guys for always being my favorite part of sunday’s ❤️
I don't know nothing about tape and mud...However I love watching Y' all.... Always fun  on Sunday.... Ask Tim your body....
Not to foget. Bob, a beard looks greate to our age. 👍👍👍
Oh man you railroaded the sheetrock your gonna have problems with your finishing at the intersections. You should only have a three way intersection of tape and mud so you can feather your mud properly
My husband's favourite building quote:  "Don't worry - trim will cover it!"  hee hee
You can't learn to do drywall unless you... just do it.  Suggestion: On 8 ft high walls,  hang your drywall standing up. That way you will have less non-tapered joints.  Suggestion 2: No protractor needed. One corner is 90 degrees so you just need to measurements.  Measure twice and cut once still applies to drywall.  Good job on hanging drywall. :-)
Like your video...dislike  your music choice.
Use less mud or you will be sanding forever or hire a mudder. They really will save you a lot of frustration.
It would be no fun watching professionals mud and tape.  I bet if you guys mud and tape, Trent and Allie will too.
Eamon and Bec, where did you get your boots from?
You guys are so close to our place. We should do a collaboration. !
yay TRENT :)
The one blue wall by the door Eamon hates.. the wiring there was very dangerous.. floating in the middle there.. if someone hangs a picture there and puts a nail or screw through the wire.. should be pinned to the stud..
I have mud and sanded drywall. I am not an expert but my suggestion is put lots of drywall compound on and then sand it smooth. But don't sand it all the way or else your have to add more compound lol. Don't worry your both will do fine  if i can do it and i have a learning disability im sure you both will do way better than me :)
listening to your bean song was so weird! I live in Pennsylvania in the US and i’ve only ever heard it as, “beans beans they’re good for your heart, the more you eat the more you fart, the more you fart the better you feel so eat beans at every meal”!!
Looks amazing!! Also what’s that song in the first 2 minutes of the video ? You guys soundtrack your videos so amazingly
Nice Job Guys!
Will there be a "Buyer Beware" for future owners about the drywall?
lmao love the kelly family rev! XD
You did a great job - from my view / but of course I don’t know anything about Reno’s like that lol 🤣🤣
As Charlie Harpers says.... "just hire a guy"...problem solved
Don’t mud and tape get a pro or you will end up doing it at least 2x
Love Trent’s reaction to hanging drywall. Get someone to mud and tape. So true! Having hung drywall, and taped, spackled, sanded, spackled, sanded, spackled sanded, spackled sanded.... did I say spackled then sanded? No? Repeat. Over time you will get the technique for taping and mud. Suggest not to use pre mixed joint compound, instead invest in mixable compound, adding a small amount of plaster of Paris will speed up the drying time on your mud job. Get graduated in size “Knives” (aka putty knives) from smallest in width to widest. professional mud applicators have a machine that tapes and muds simultaneously. Don’t know if you can rent one. But if you do decide to tackle this yourself practice on a scap piece of drywall. Learning how to feather your application is the biggest hurdle. One piece of advice, once you smear out your compound, don’t try to go back and resmear it. Forget using the mesh tape, that’s for repairing holes, always use paper tape.  Good luck and my the mud be with you.
Great episode yet again!!!! Still think Bob woulda had that drywall done in 10 mins but hey ho. Lol. Have a great week guys x
NERD Power realness....at its best. Thanks for keeping it real Bec!!!!
I have no experience with drywall but it looks like y’all did great!! Y’all are adorable. ♥️
the best advise I can give is watch YOUTUBE videos to see how it's done! you will be fine!! mudding isn't hard...... I watched my ex-husband do our whole house!..... I didn't help since I was 8-1/2 month preggers! can't wait to see it done now!
Hey love the glasses But the Alignment next time keep a stick in the truck. Put the stick down at the ball of the hitch so you can see it from the driver's seat. The back up to the stick you should be right in Alignment for the hitch
Don't apply the plaster to sparingly. More is better. Make a uge gap between the single sheets and place a plaster bandarge to the filled seam. Look that the screws are at minimum 4 mm deep. Smooth the filler not to exact at the beginning. Sand the dry filler with a uge wooden board. The result is as good as you like it. 🤞🤞🤞
Is the coffee machine any good
Just an observation; maybe you put a jack stand under the trailer so you don’t have to pick it up.
That ladder is the ultimate flex
Hey Guys , mudding and taping is easy, Plus alot less hard carrying. A little more messy when you go to sand off the lines.  Make sure your screws are not  flush with the dry wall. You will have more fun doing it , because  you can both do it at the same time,. Just mudd let dry, reapply. mudd again sand, Have funnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn Dave in Ohio
A tip - if you don't know this already - ROTOZIP - or equivalent generic off brand one. Makes cutouts so much simpler - easier - faster. And best technique is to use the bit as a "router" of sorts to ride along studs or framing. You punch through - got to stud or frame slowly / carefully - then ride the surface all along to get a perfect cut out of a window - door etc . .
Fantastic job 👍 love you guys
Well for first time dry walling you have done a great job I hate dry walling myself , now remember I’m a 69 yr old widow woman so I do know what everybody says about let the professionals do it but that cost money, the trick to taping and muddying,..... taping is not hard but it’s like you have to get the moisture part for the tape just right, I’ve seen it done few different ways they even have tape that is like webbing with sticky on the back. But the muddying part is and i was told this by the pro’s apply the mud in thin layers otherwise as it dries it will crack and sanding it smooth will be much easier you all will have a lot of mudding to do I’d hire someone but it’s your call good luck with that but it looks great can’t wait to see how it turns out ...... my thought on any job is you don’t know if you and do it unless you try so give it you best shot look at what you have accomplished already ....it’s going to be fine as always sending love and prayers your way ❤️❤️❤️🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🌈🌈🌈
I used to Drywall, but instead of typing a paragraph; I would advise you to U-tube your butts off.  I am sure there is a tutorial for everything. LOL  Best of luck!
Dry walling is easy if you're good with measurements. The mud and taping is easy once you get the hang of it. Your doing a great job for beginners.
You need some insulation for sound proofing on those interior ceilings and walls—especially bedroom walls...just saying. Nobody want to hear ...snoring coming from the next room...yeah snoring.
Doesn't use a protractor...  it doesn't make sense. Measure twice cut once!!!
What about the dog mossa
Seriously I don't think there is much that phases you guys lol good job xx
Everybody tells them it’s difficult. Me: hanging drywall is not difficult just need to nail it up with a nail gun. Eamon: there’s nails everywhere this must’ve been down in the 70s. Me: oh there’s a new way to do it now, it’s probably difficult.
Wow!!! That ride into town is breathtakingly beautiful!!!👠🚌👠
Sprinter van to Bhutan 🇧🇹 would great
Oh What the Heck ! :)
After Eamon's haircut u guys look like u r having more fun hahah ... Great episode as always thank you ❤
watch life uncontained on YouTube and you will quickly hire someone to hang the drywall lol
Love it ♥️
Still waiting on insulation in the interior walls. As it is now, you’re going to be hearing Bob fart in the guest room when he comes up.
also why do people on the other side of the pond always split it on the middle of the wall ?   just install them standing
it looks great. I wonder where mossa?
NERDS united...
As long as you're not hanging drywall on the ceiling it's not difficult.
great video, what is up with trinity?, won't you have to do something soon?
Don't know why people are saying avoid doing drywall - it's not that bad! You did an ace job. I wouldn't worry too much about the edges, you can tape over when you skim, no one will ever know.
I have two words for you: Vancouver Carpenter. Watch his channel. I'm sorry I didn't when I started drywalling my basement. But after watching him, it definitely is easier (albeit much slower).  Also, stay away from the mesh tape and learn to work with paper tape.
i hop[e get a mudder. hanging is one thing mudding is another
Taping is easy....muddying is another story. I once watched a pro and he had two spatulas, one smaller than the other. So he’d apply the mud with the smaller spatula in one hand, then feather over it with the larger spatula using his other hand. It was slick. Also, I “sand” the finished mud with a damp dense soft wallpaper sponge. No dust this way.
Once a week is not enough for me
Hi Guys, when drywalling put the first sheet at floor level then you can sit the second sheet on the top edge of the first sheet, saves struggling holding it against the wall at head height. Also doing cuts, fix biggest sheets first and smallest last, then if it’s wrong you only have to re do the smaller board, saves on materials. If possible fix full sheets in multiple rooms and do cuts last out of off cuts. Great job guys.

Love your videos, everyone get a big kick out of you guys , so funny, stay with it guys,your doing good,
should check out lifeuncontained on here, they're currently dry walling, you should of done the walls including the door then cut the door out afterwards I think, not an expert just what ive seen.
So excited for podcasts!
Hanging is physically hard but kinda easy. Muddying takes really good technique (suggest finding lots of YouTube videos- which we didn’t have at the time) and it’s dusty and gross to sand. After doing once in our first house I started to do a lot of t and g and paint it or hired out drywall. It’s amazing how good some people are at it and quick! So worth the money. I’d do electrical myself before drywall.
Invest in a sander shop vac attachment!  It won't take care of all of the dust, but it helps a lot!
I would rather put the office instead of another guest bedroom. Because u should use the location in the house that ist the most accessible. And If you don't already plan on making an office I would recommend it because you guys edit a lot and have a podcast so a good desk and an office chair would be really helpful for your health.
My husband and I did it together.. it wasn’t fun but it worked and came out pretty good.. If I do say so myself! 😉 You guys make a great team 👏🏻
@9:35... I'd follow Bec anywhere!
Why are you not putting isolation in the walls/ceiling? Could have made the place a lot warmer 🙈 Bitta kingspan or fibreglass rolls place would be so toasty
You might want to watch Life Uncontained on YouTube,I think you might find it very interesting an helpful with your new journey
I liked your vid. I've been trying to research for  a educational vid that really educates everything in this vid! 👏Your tip for sure reminds me of the videos of this smart health enthusiast Doctor Ethan. Dr Ethan's tips are really informative and he actually helped me a lot on my studies. He is an educational Dr.  I suggest you watch his YouTube out and give the med student a subscribe here! 👉 #DoctorEthanYouTube
Love this!! Per usual Sundays are always better with new Eamon & Bec :)
I’m only 2 minutes in but had to comment because I was literally thinking aww it’s so cozy like stars hollow when they drove into town! Also anyone know the songs throughout the vlog? I wish they were all linked because it’s like a perfect chill Sunday playlist every vlog & I looveee it!!
Love, Love, Love the trimmed beard
We didn’t have. Good luck with the mud part. Everything else we found doable. We tried but ended up calling a professional to finish the job. Hope you guys have better luck. Y’all are awesome! The cabin is looking good!
how do you heat that house😀
Get a book on how to do it. It is a pain to do, but doable.  I've done it myself.
Awesome job you guys, knew you could do it !!!
Great job kids i figured you could do it. And i have faith in you. You can mud and tape. Its not that hard. Love ya. Hugs. ❤🙂
with your statement that if you make a mistake you cover it with lipstick Laughs so I thought that is what women use so much makeup and lipstick
On the Omaze things, they put in the legal parts for the winner : "In addition to all of the other requirements stated in these Official Rules, if the Potential Winner is a Canadian resident, (s)he must correctly answer a mathematical skill-testing question to be eligible to be confirmed the Winner. " ???? I'm soooo confused. WHY??
drywaller ?  it aint even a occupation in sweden.  :)  just a part of being a builder.  Drywalled so much that i wanna puke .
3 months in 1 place...  new record for you!  Greetings from Vancouver Island🇨🇦💕
Beck: Did you get a massage, did you take Ibuprofen, did you stretch?  Beck: I think you need a protractor. Comes out pretty good. Beck: look who was right me.  Beck: Gloats horribly over a heavy piece of dry wall hung up by Eamon because it fits in place.  Eamon: Replaces Beck for someone who will, take care if him while he is sick, massage his back, give him Ibuprofen, help him stretch and encourage him while he is working.  Take care of each other!

Can you please tell us what’s in your camera bag? Or at least tell us the camera and lens you are using please
Hanging it is easy. Mudding and taping it is a pain in the ass. People that do it for a living can knock it out with no problems and make it look easy. But it isn’t. Not saying you can’t do it. You just don’t want to. Lol
Tapping and Mudding is so easy. You guys got this.
If you are going to tape and mud yourself make sure you plan to put a pretty heavy texture on top to hide the imperfections. Lots and lots of little coats - do notttt rush it. Take it from someone who’s “buddy who used to do drywall” did her walls. Mudding truly is a practice makes better kinda thing.
I love, DON’T DO IT, but you did it and it looks fine. Did you do this one before you fostered the pup? How long of a trip is it into town? It looks like a beautiful drive. Stay safe❤️
two bathrooms? right across the hall from each other?
I was so impressed that Eamon DID only get one thing at the hardware store-need to know how he did that?
My husband use to do drywall, and its not for the faint of heart...ALSO, maybe put a time capsule behind your drywall, for a future person to find! Sending hugs, from Haliburton, Ontario! Kim
Thanks for the video love you
Tape and several THIN coats of mud!!!
Keep it coming. Look forward to seeing you every week!
Huzzah! You two ROCK!
You guys are awesome. I’m going to to say it every Sunday. You need to make her your wife. Oh ya hire a tapper it will be less sanding because muddying is one thing sanding it to perfection is something else.
Go for it you can do it
Ahhh so stocked Reroot is coming back, I just finished the last episode a few weeks ago !  Loved this video as well ! A little sad we didn't get to see Mossa, do you guys shoot a week before it's out (so that would be last week)? Anyway I guess we'll see him next week and I can't wait ! I'm very confused how everybody told you not to do drywalls, I've always seen my dad and friends etc doing those (I'm from France) lol See you sunday !
Be particular in your mudding, flat even strokes, the better the coats, the easier they sand.
ya run from the mudding and cover everything sanding is nasty. Mudding and taping is really an art.
Since you live in the house  a pro to tape it will create a lot less dust for you to live with and be a lot  cleaner
Are those boots warm? Cute, need some. If so what brand please?
The triangle no protractor needed just a parallel to project the correct angle from the ceiling to the board this may need to be done more than once depending on the width of the parallel. while holding the board in the correct position no nerds needed and will do an even better job
It's just a matter of practice. The mud work will be very easy once you get the hang of it. Do a couple of thin coats so it dries and sands easier without misshaping, or causing lumps. You got this! Say hi to Bob from me!
Good job guys!
Looking great! You guys are nuts for wanting to tackle taping and mudding yourself, but you handle everything like pros, I must say! Question/comment: is there insulation in the wall between your bedrooms? It didn't look like it in the video. Hopefully there is, otherwise there is no sound barrier between you and your guests. Just a thought.
Don’t, for the love o god don’t mud yourself ....but well done on the drywalling, great job for first timers 👍
I was told that newer Sprinter vans can't do Mexico because of the diesel fuel not being compatible with newer motors.
Hey guys, just binged watched 10 episodes today 😬😳all caught up, love the energy you guys have, and the Cabin is really taking shape awesome job, and got me through a full lockdown Sunday in the UK 🙄I laughed so much with some of your antics, especially yoga pants guys.... Eamon maybe fit a backup camera for hitching the trailer.
Like a few others have said, mudding and taping aren’t actually that bad if you thin out the mud, wipe it down with a very wet sponge (not damp, submerged and then quickly squeezed, still dripping water is what you want)  right away and just accept doing several very thin layers. Pros can do it well with thicker mud and fewer layers, but that’s only because of practice. You’ll be sanding to get things nice and smooth between layers, but sanding can only do so much. The point where people really start cursing the job and swearing to hire pros in the future is when they realize they made things too thick and uneven for the sanding to do much good. Thus the thin layers and sponging down to really smooth it before it dries.   Also, the degree to which the dust will get everywhere cannot be exaggerated. Use twice as much plastic to protect the kitchen, etc. as you think you’ll need.  I’d hang it from he loft to the floor between the living room and dining room but also drape your dining table and kitchen counters in it while you’re working. Especially since you are going to be eating in that space during the time you’re doing the job, you want to make extra sure you don’t need to wash every dish before every lunch and dinner can even be prepared. Laying plastic everywhere will feel like overkill but it truly isn’t.
Great job guys! Excited to see more. You two are so lucky to be able to spend your time building your own house, and even making money in the process! Living the dream :)
I so admire your ability to tackle all those tasks yourself.  As for me, I'm much better at writing checks.  Hats off to you guys!
I entered the giveaway and I live in Colorado!!! Double win?!?
Awesome job on the drywall guys!! Taping and mudding is a reall b^£€h! You may want to get someone in for that.😊
15:26 I'm like ... "what's in my microwave?!  🤔🤔🤔"
Sleepy hollow is in New  York, that's where my dad used to take us fishing when we were younger
🥰 Oh I can see your house smiling 🏠 the love and care you are giving it is so amazing.
Oh a snap of Bob and he has a beard!  Lookin good!!
If anyone can do it it’s you guys. So fun to see you talking to Trent (Trent and Allie) my other favorite couple.
cutenest , music, nah.
YES - drywall is INCREDIBLY taxing physically - very labor intensive - takes a long time with multiple steps involved and even quite messy when you get to all the mudding - taping and sanding. And THEN you have to paint it. And even getting it to your place is a nightmare - with paid delivery being the best route. I HATE drywalling. And with 2 small people like yourselves - you have to be careful to not hurt yourselves - especially if you are attempting ceiling drywall. ( rent a lift ) Anyway - good luck. If you can afford and a crew of at least 2 really big strong guys to do it for you - it can be worth the cost. Especially if they have done it for a while - or years and years - because they are incredibly fast - and can make it look perfect easily.
I used texturing as my way to plaster.  Not with grit but trowel tool.  Color finish too.  Venetian plaster.? Sweet abandon. Be creative.  From now on I'll use boards if affordable.
I am soooo impressed!!!! Damn
do not mud and tape..  but if you do, spray texture on wall to hide all your mistakes :),  because you will see them.
Guys love how much u bringing happiness to us by watching ur hard work, positve energy and love. All the love all the way from Yemen 🇾🇪.
Brilliant Job guys.
Pay someone to do the mud/tape. You can do it, it will just take a ton of practice to get it right, and it probably isn't worth that kind of time investment. It really isn't something you learn to to well in a day or even a week. But if you are going to try it, watch this guy first: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL34cQkzKfXWanlUzNzLhfMK1s7w0Un9gt
Great job!
I drywalled my living room once, my living room was covered in plastic for 3 weeks from having to sand the mud over and over and over again. My mud had air bubbles in it and I'd sand the dried mud it would have all these little holes, then I'd mud over the holes, then sand again, more holes, then mud again and sand. A pro could have done it once and done. Sanding mud makes huge dust clouds. Mudding is a craft you can't learn very quickly. I'll be paying someone to mud next time I do sheetrock and I never hire out work.
It looks great! 🙌 I love that you guys are always ready to tackle almost anything to get the job done.
Great drywalling!
Drywall awesome!
Does anyone know what the song playing in the beginning of this episode is?
Great job with the drywall.  Despite what you were told.  Thumbs up for Eamon and Bec.  Greetings from Switzerland.
Ever thought of insulating above your ceiling panels? Would help retain the heat and also provide some soundproofing
Can’t wait to start my van life journey
I drywall for a living. when you tape and mud you should 100% make sure to lay down paper so you dont get mud everywhere! I recommend Black Top All purpose Joint Compound for the first coat and Plus 3 Blue top mud for the second and third coats. Good luck!
you can do it, watch a few videos for the basics. I notice a few comments to sand between coats and generally that is not necessarily the best advice. rather use your putty knife to knock quickly knockoff the high points when the first coat is dry and lay down the next coat. Likely you will need three or four coats and sanding between coats will remove material that will just need to be be added back. the first and second coats will look rough but don't let that discourage you.
You can do it.  Watch video the go have fun
What an awesome feeling it must be to sit back and look at what you’ve accomplished like that!!  Ik you guys already are but be proud of yourselves!! Not just for working so hard on the house but working as a team so well!
Your cabin is looking soo good! It has come a long way! Enjoyed the episode!
Also currently drywalling with my parter and having similar “discussions” hahahah can’t wait to see the mud!!! Love you both <3
Dude. I am consistently impressed with Eamon and his ability to not only build stuff, but make it look really good! Everything you guys do is gold. I’ll always be stoked to see what you’re doing next!!
At 17:12, only concern is the hidden wire there, might have an electrical problem later if you try to hang a picture there abs pierce the wire. Maybe you can channel the spray foam along the stud, that way it should be out of the way of a stray screw later
2x4s look very tight around hot chimney pipe.. as young kid my pole lamp burnt a hole into plaster board sloped ceiling.  Later as teenager baseboard heater ignited whole room when lamp cord contacted heating elements
looks beautiful there in Canada eh! good choice withe the cabin build!
Nothing better then Sunday morning coffee while watching my favorite you tubers!!!
You will regret muddding...and if you don't, you are definitely kot normal. My ex was a rock/ plasterer/ painter and he us the best I know, but the taping and pkastering took him years to perfect. Good luck you optimistic nerds!!!
Omg the podcast is back!!!!!!!
I haven’t gotten my cookbook yet , ordered in December  Lov the vids
I can’t wait to see when it’s all done, it’s going to be stunning! I absolutely love following your journey in making this place your own❤️
Wear swimming goggles when you sand your mud to keep the dust out of your eyes. Taping is easy, mud takes finesse & patience & will hurt your back. The triangle wall looks like it will be the hardest, save it for last. Good luck and stretch!
Tape and Mudd easy...light coats sanding sucks...this is hubby's favourite part of homebuilding 😜🤣
You too are so funny!  😂
Less screws love u guys
You two are my favorite youtubers, fellow canadians. I wait every sunday for your video. My husband who is an electrician licensed in Ontario and made a comment about your first blue wall with triple gang box that the wires were not stappled to the 2x4. He glanced up while watching the video. He was wondering if this was done before putting up drywall because it is a safety issue and it doesn't meet ontario electrical code. Keep up the great work, looking forward to podcast tomorrow!!
You guys did very well hanging that drywall. A few comments learned from my mistakes. Always stagger vertical joints. Put some Rockwool in the wall between bedrooms and other rooms to keep noise transmission down. I always get a pro to mud and tape. This is what makes or breaks the job. In addition, the sanding dust will be way low as their joints are almost perfect once done. My 2 cents.
Tape is easy. But when putting 'mud on', scrape it off so it only fills indentations, let dry, give another coat. Don't put mountains on and think you can just sand it down. horrible work sanding and you just sand wrong places anyway!!!!!!! If you scape it on fine two or even three times, you almost don't need to sand, just a light sanding and you are done!!! :-) My thoughts!!!! what you've done looks great!!!
Perfection...NERDS RULE, buddies drool 🤤
Just keep in mind that all the mud you put up you have to sand....and sand and sand lol. Keep it thin!
she is back @5:34
she is back @5:34
she is back @5:34
Hanging sheet rock is an arduous task.....mudding and taping THAT is an art. My opinion....hire a professional.
she is back @5:34
she is back @5:34
A for effort!!!! So a few things when hanging drywall is try to use full sheet and cut around openings so you have less joints to mud besides who ever is mudding not sure if thats you guys it will be a hell of a challenge! the guy that will mud will know it was not professionally done! keep up the great work videos are awesome.
Although you guys are the “A” Team and kick ass with all you do, save yourselves and Hire a professional to do the tape and mud.  🥰  you will be happy you did........ just saying 💋
taping and mudding is not bad - heck a lot easier than hanging the dryway especially when you have off angles to be considered.
My boyfriend and I love watching your channel every Sunday! We also just went back and (inspired by your recent posts of Mossa) watched your series with Rojo. You two are such amazing doggie foster parents! We fell in love with Rojo so hard and cried when he was united with his forever family! I am so SO relieved to be able to follow him on Instagram now as I grew very attached! Do you guys ever visit him now that you're not too far away?
In the UK, mud and tape is called plastering. Anyone can do it, the difference being, when you run your finger over a professional's work it will feel like glass with almost no imperfections (lumps, scratches and divots); an amateur's work will look and feel like a cave wall. It is actually most difficult in warm weather, because it dries before you get a chance to get the smooth even finish. Even an experienced amatuer can expect a lot (hours) of sanding and filling once finished. You'll be fine!
Hi guy's I love the vibe between u too and cracking joke's and spirit. Do u know youtubers Life Uncontained- he dose the dry wall himself he accually build whole house himself after wife giving birth. U do need people around who belive in u
This is sooooo satisfying omg!!! I was waiting for this since you moved in the cabin ❤️❤️❤️ all the love From Honduras 🇭🇳
Mudding is No problem, have done my whole house my self, and it is not very difficult. Just need some patiens, and apply many layers until it is flatt. I usualy find that 3-4 layers is enough. I would recomend cutting a groove where you hav puttes upp te drywall, so that te mud getts some ting to stuck to. Love your videos, jeep up the good work. Greetings from Norway, hope you visit her soon after the pandemic.
It’s your first home trial and error why not try drywall!!!! The house is coming along awesome Bec in yoga pants it’s always a treat on the weekend😊
I think you guys can do ANYTHING.
I’m excited it’s Sunday!!!!! And I’m super excited for Monday for the first time during this pandemic and home schooling! You want to know why......Eamon & Bec and now Reroot! Yahooooo
Always Awesome Guys!!    Thanks
Ok this is sooooo nice to look at 😍 oh and at the end of the video we can see some Macramé, where are they from ? :o
The mudding stuff will drive you crazy. It can be done but ......it will test you.
I would say the taping isn’t too bad it’s all the stinking sanding and the mess it makes that’s the super unfun part. Not “hard” just gets very tedious and annoying.
GOOD JOB!!!!! Hard work pays off!!!
My dad used to do all his home diy. His over the top pro tip:  put insulation between inside walls for a bit of sound proofing. Of course he had 5 kids lol.
😆 gonna look nice when its done
add a little dishwashing liquid to the mud to avoid fisheyes (bubbles)
Dam straight Bec! Protractor for the win!
Mud should be done with a light hand, as you have to sand it too. Start small and go for it.
You should take a spa break or see a good chiropractor to straighten everything up!
You guys are seriously the best thing about Sunday’s!!!!
You can use a speed square to get out the angles
If you aren't using one, get some drywall dimpler bits for setting the drywall screws. Sets them to the perfect depth. Also, lots of contractors now add construction adhesive on the studs prior to screwing the drywall down. Helps eliminate popped fasteners.
Doin a great job, way to go, dont be afraid, its the mudding and sanding that is scary. Be careful of that back Eamon, you dont want to make it worse🔨🪓🔨⛏🔧🛠⚒🔭✏🗒✂🥡🚩🏠🧽🧹🚯✅🚻🆗👩‍❤️‍👩 Love you both, you are an amazing couple
lol like 15 people could’ve said don’t do it and Lee is like ‘GO FOR IT’. Love her ❤️
Yay so happy reroot is back!!
" who runs the world nerds"  " Who gets it wrong buddy"🤣🤣🤣
You guys are totally awesomely crazy! Every Sunday you make me laugh and teach me how to be brave! All the love from Lithuania! <3
It’s just a dirty job is all... make sure you have a good respiratory system! Well done guys! ❤️
Nice 👍 and they said not to do it 🙄
🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷
You guys are so cute.  I enjoyed seeing you both traveling throughout Europe and America.  Fixing up your home was a good transition.  I look forward to your vlog.
Happy Sunday to you both!
Hi from Spain I love your videos. Be safe
y'all are CRAZY!! ....in a cool way ;)
I think I could just sit here for hours and watch you guys!! I wish the video were so much longer!!
Favorite part was seeing all the friends on the call about doing the dry wall! Please do more! It nice to see the other friends of the community.
I so appreciate your videos ~ smile while watching ~ thank you!
I’m digging Bob’s beard 🧔🏼
My dad is a crackfiller and it can take years of practice to make things look perfectly smooth and well done!
I made my attic livable back in 2000. I only had one whole sheet and 80 pieces. 80 !  You just get better as you go with mudding. Patience. Take your time. I love watching your videos and Trent and Allie's too. I liked those building days. I now live in the house my father built. I was 2 when he started, but through the years I have helped on many projects around here
hire someone to tape and mud.
I'm starting with an internship tomorrow and I am very nervous! I am so happy that I can watch your video! Really helps me to relax a bit! ❤
eamon is giving sadd_papi vibes iykyk
You might be good at it.
🇹🇷
Why not upload the podcast to youtube? I personally would be more likely to watch it through video and that way you also get adsense!
Of course Eamon and Bec are going to totally ‘smash it’ when EVERYONE else says don’t do it!! 🙈We all know them by now. Great work though guys.🙌🏼 how’s the hammock holding up though? That’s such a cool idea too!  Love Georgie from 🇬🇧
Are you not supposed to put insulation on the outside walls behind the DRY WALL.....
It is so messy when you start sanding the drywall. Dry wall dust everywhere......Been there, Done that!
The ole nipple measurement, works like a charm! 😆😜
Listen to someone who did two rooms and a bathroom, call someone to tape and mud. Wait till you find grit on and in everything.
DON’T DO IT!!!!!!
Next time you do drywall start from the bottom going up it’s much easier
Hubby and I laughed with you guys so much in the past 2 videos!   You guys are doing great!!! We built our own house... I was the taper/mudder... not my favorite job...
Don’t mud & tape, so not worth the time and effort! Get an expert, they’re worth their weight in gold!
It’s so funny to me to think people are scared of drywall. When I was a teenager, my dad (who’s a farmer and a huge advocate for doing everything yourself) was remodeling an old 7 bedroom farmhouse. So there was a lot of walls moving around and removing the old plaster and lathe to change a bedroom into a bathroom and a lot of other odds and ends like this. When we were installing the drywall and doing the taping and mudding, 15 yr old Victoria didn’t think it was that bad haha
Love watching you guys.   You can do the muddying!     Put on thin coats and it needs to be warm when you do the muddying per my husband!
Taping and mudding- easy peasy. Sanding- THE. WORSE. JOB. ON. THE. PLANET. Well worth the money to hire a professional (although they will want to do the mudding because they know how to make it easier for sanding)
Hi guys, we are UK based and currently renovating our 3rd family home. We have done all our own plasterboard (drywall) and plastering (undercoat and skimming) work and whilst it's time consuming, it will save you a lot of money. What you've done so far looks absolutely brilliant and I bet you feel a real sense of achievement. Keep going it looks fab!
NEED a link for eamon's round glasses
Each to their own, but “buddy” is not what I want my romantic partner to call me.
With mudding, less is more!!! Thin coats!! Helps in the long run, trust me on that 💜💙💚✌
Prop the trailer end on a couple cinder blocks back enough so you can pull underneath the hitch.   You should be able to make it high enough so the front end of the trailer is a little higher than the back so it can still drain.
Lol loving the intro. Your Cabin looks Amazing  Love From the UK 🇬🇧
Well plaster board up and looks so much better than that blue . Just need to put the plaster on now . Oh sorry thats what we call it . But looking great its coming along .
What were builders smoking in the 70s? 😂 Our house is like Wonka’s factory!
Should have torn it all down and started over
Taping and mudding is hard but the sanding is, ugh, so messy.
Can’t wait to see those front doors go , they look like they belong in a public library or building. Other than that Great Job!👍
I am not saying you can't  do the mud and taping, it's really hard, dirty work and so time consuming, but the worst part is every mistake will show through the paint. If you hire someone it will get done way faster and the finish product will be better.
I would think that mudding and taping would be the easy part. Go for it!
You should definitely do the taping and muddying yourself, prepare to sand a lot and you’re fine. Practice on making the mud (if you’re mixing powder with water), making it smooth like toothpaste. Make also sure the tape is recessed to prevent thick layers. Just start with gaps, apply tape, mud, let it dry, sand, redo if needed. I’m looking forward to the next episode!
So what’s the paint colors y’all will be going with Bec?!
just a pro tip for drywall is to stagger the joints
Did you just measure the first triangle back to front? Hence why it didn’t work?
Do it! That's how you learn.
You should not the wall out between the master and the guest room
Everyone else: DON’T DO IT! . Lee: GO FOR IT!!! . 🤣🤣🤣🤣
I almost left my husband over mudding and taping drywall.....do. not.recommend!
Drywall isn't that bad. (Vehicle) body work is much worse.
at least you don't whine about things like Trent does LOL
Mudding and taping are easy, but they take a long time because of dry times. Do it!
Yay it’s Sunday!!!
Lol..interesting that Trent and Allie are hiring someone to do drywall!  But they have those really high ceiling and walls! I have watched and helped my dad do some drywall many years ago. The sheets are heavy, but the tape and mud is doable!  Drywall contractors are fast and they are mesmerizing to watch, but if you are not in a hurry, you can get it done!
Good luck with drywall 👍we know if anyone can pull this off...it's Eamon &Bec.♥️✌️
Y'all are legitimately the most adorable couple I've seen on YouTube.
Start mudding in a room you don’t care so much about or that will have a lot of pictures and stuff ! Keep it thin !
They will probably hate I said this, but I’ll miss these days in the future. This is better than HGTV shows.
Get a mudder
Don't do it!!!!....get a pro in to tape and mud.
Still startles me when I first see Eamon with short hair :). Hanging drywall is the easy part. Taping, mudding and sanding is hard.  Put mud on thin and wet sand. The dust gets into EVERYTHING 😟
When we decided to finish off the lower level of our house , we hired the hanging of the drywall out. I figured, since I was an art major in college, I should be able to do the mudding and taping. Two weeks later, I started getting carpal tunnel syndrome from holding the taping knife, the taped seams looked sub par. I called back the drywall guy. He said he’d seen worse. It took him two halfdays to clean up my sloppy job.  Hire out the mudding and taping. You will not regret it.
un saludo desde Valladolid ,España
I’ve been wanting to ask what is going to happen to your van that you left overseas?
Great job....OK, if time doesn't matter, do it yourself :-) You've now reached the "art" portion of your remodel. Perhaps it's time for an artist to take over.
Sorry about your back Eamon. Some back muscles are "shunting" to help with the healing. You just need to respect what your body is telling you and be patient. Hopefully, you will notice you get to be a tidsy better day after day. Sorry to comment so much this weekend, I am suppose to research retirement funds. "drywalling" looks funner  hihi
you guys are my fave couple on YouTube.  Sunday morning is the coolest!!  you killed the drywall.  I am super impressed!!!  wonder what you will do...paint?  wallpaper?  to be continued..
I knew you guys would do this, you two love trying new things no matter what others say!! Great job!
Bring Tim back for the taping, mudding and sanding!
your boarding is fine but sling a piece of wood on the floor and use that pry bar as a lever to lift the boards.. cut the boards against a wall, making a table out of them leaves no space to work.. protractor? No Bec, bad Bec..  good job though.. 9/10... as others have said, do a few thin tight coats of mud, sanding is painfully boring.. here in the uk we plaster, screed, render etc, we can mud but it’s not skilled and rarely needed here and we leave that to the painters..
What is the song at the start of the video shazam doesn't work?
Brains and Brawn...taking over the world!!
You can do the muddying and taping, but once you start you’ll realize a pro would have been done in half the time and twice the result.  Pick a small room, give it a go and then call a pro for the rest.
please call 1 800 drywall and you can stay together .. eh
Super great job!!  💪💪
Mud and tape is the hardest part.?
better than anything on TV... Have a great week!
Now Trent and Allie know who to call for drywall!
Glad you are placing the drywall with the wide side across, in opposite direction of the studs. Good show. Only suggestion: When going around window/door openings, lay one piece completely over the opening, screw the piece down, then cut out the opening. Repeat for upper drywall piece.
In the UK it's called plaster board and DIYers do it regularly but when it comes to plastering then most people will get someone in to do it unless they decide to do it themselves.  I think that you call it muddling. Put me right if that's not correct  Your doing a magnificent job
Hi eamon & bec i love you guys
loving the hair eamon
As a drywaller, please don't try it yourself. The worst part of drywalling is fixing other people's mistakes 😪
NO WAYYYYY I LOVE GILMORE GIRLS I RE WATCH IT AND RE WATCH!!! UGHHH LOVE THAT SHOW AND YES IT IS STARS HOLLOW!!!!
So, tell us why you didn’t insulate BETWEEN bedrooms?? 😆😆
So excited for reroot again!! I’ve listened to your vegan story episode several times. 🔥
I'M SO EXCITED FOR YOUR PODCAST!!
I feel ya Eamon.
I'm impressed you guys!! Great work!!
your videos always teach me new stuff! thanks, btw what boots do you guys where? I love the style
0:58 Can someone please tell me the name of this song and the artist?
You guys are ✨thriving✨ and I just love to see it
Just a bid of advice... I had almost the same style cottage. The would on the ceiling tends to squeak when it's windy outside.
As an electrician, drywallers are our natural sworn enemies. I have new respect for them though 😂 but my coworker can do the whole shebang herself, pretty impressive. Thanks for making Sunday's fundays!! Can't wait for the omaze results 😏
u guys do lot of things i will be happy to hear all the behind the scenes in podcast which you guys don't show .
There's a good chance one or both of you will to try to kill each other if you attempt mudding and taping. Hire it out.
Eamon I love you man, your ability to give your authentic self and not being the best at backing up to hook up. Gave me a needed laugh thanks! 💜
There’s a tool that you put on your drill so when you screw the screw into the plasterboard it stops ever so slightly in, stops popping the paper and costs a couple of dollars, google drywall screw bit, saves loads of time and like I say stops the board popping in the future
Excellent job on the drywall. Please, please, please hire someone to tape and mud. Honestly when the lights turn on in the evening you will see every single ripple, bump and uneven mud spot. Don’t invest your valuable time trying to do this and end up with a substandard job. (Even when you say yeah, it’ll be fine - it won’t be. People that come to your place will say oh yeah, you guys did a great job but they will be lying. LOL)
From amateur "diy"ers ourselves, our drywall mudding tip is thin layer, sand, thin layer, sand, again and again until you have the desired smoothness or do a texture or a textured paint job so maybe you don't notice. Hahahaha. We remodeled our salon and we kinda figured it out but our business partner at the time did not and we ended up doing a sponge paint job and its less noticeable but wouldn't recommend that way. Go slow and be a perfectionist...it will pay off in the end!
Two words of advice: Vancouver Carpenter. I've been doing the ceiling/walls in my house and they look a lot better because of his channel.
You guys make me wanna go study as hard as i can, finish my engineering degree and get my hands in a fun project like you always do!! Love your videos! <3
Expanding foam for all the small joints 👍🏻
hire mud and tape
For first time doing drywall you did a great job! Your outlet cutouts seemed to fit well, doing the mud is a matter of practice, you can do it, will probably be doing a bit of sanding though. Never give up!
it looks a lot easier than it sounds

Tape and Mud...hire a pro!  Takes serious skill and if done wrong the bumps will show , tons of sanding mess, and the tape will eventually pop out in places. Hired un-pros, had to have it redone, and new guy finished in 1/4 of the time and it was perfect. They can quickly do the messy texturing also. Money well spent!  Good luck!
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻❤️❤️❤️❤️didn’t doubt you at all...but apparently mud and tapping can be messy...but such an accomplishment when it done! 🙋🏻‍♀️🇬🇧💕jane
Muddying and sanding is a PIA but its so satisfying to see the finished job.
Mudding isn't that bad tbh, its the sanding and all the mess that sucks. Rent a giraffe sander with proper vacuum cleaner, and it's a piece of cake! (And you will be proud for having done it yourself)
5:34 of course Lee will support you guys with whatever you decide!! She's part of the throuple!
Just cover all the drywall with wood, no taping or mudding,  Hell its just money :)
I absolutely adore you two! Since I discovered your channel about two months ago, I'm obsessed with your content. You guys are such inspiring, funny, calming, and kind people. Keep it up! <3
Greetings from cold Bavaria! Just donated :D love you guys so much! I am so glad I‘ve found you on YT. You make my day!
I love watching you guys :) I always look forward to your videos and can really appreciate the hard work involved with content creation.  Keep up the awesome work and thanks for sharing your lives with us!
You guys should of staggered your drywall; or at least do that for your next rooms
Your videos are actually the highlight of my week!
I'm a truck driver listen to a lot of Podcast I'm a subscriber!
Yay! Drywall hanging is doable for any newbie, but please, learn from my mistake, taping you can do, but DO NOT try to mud your walls or you’ll have to learn to live with them bumpy and stripy. It’s really an art form.
I need drywall done at my house, you’re hired! 😁
In the UK we have a phrase ‘bed side manner’. It relates to Doctors and Nurses, good or bad bedside manner.  Bec would never make a nurse, ‘it’s not funny’.  ‘He doesn’t help himself’ 😂😂😂😂😂😂
with covid it might be hard, but do you have a " Habitat for humanity " store that will take  the wall finish you removed to resell to somebody? just curious.
Sunday morning routine!  Love seeing you guys! ♥ 🤗
BoBs looking handsome with that fabulous beard 💙
My brother and his wife built as a wall where our former kitchen bar counter that was never used and awkward to the layout and my dad and I ruined it with the mudding😂😭- we only noticed after we painted so be careful! Aside from that, you guys are doing great😂😁😁
As im watching everyone say its hard and not to do drywall.. Im like I learned to do it when I was like 8 or 9 😂😂 and i actually enjoy it lol
My parents drywalled their entire place when I was a kid. It's hard work but y'all can do it. Just use texture over it. My parents aren't drywallers, just DIYers. It will be fine.
Watch Vancouver carpenter on YouTube for drywalling tips. Best drywaller in the great white North 👌
4:39 What do you do when everyone in your community tells you not to do something? DO IT ANYWAY 😂
Thoroughly impressed!! Great job guys.
Awesome job guys.
Have a go in the guest room and see how you feel about the rest!  And it’s the zip wall you MUST put up along with the respirators you MUST wear  when you go to finish for paint or paper prep...we hired a ‘professional’who neglected the zip wall and had dust all over our house...what a horror!
jeez I gotta find a chick like bec..I eny your guys life!
great video, love you guys! Bec i was wondering what your puffy scarf is? I live here in Maine and work outside all day and would sooo love one!
The editing is amazing, congrats!
Paint those two little bits of drywall in the living room a teal blue for nostalgia :) then Eamon gets his drywall and bec gets her blue! Lol
Bummer. One must donate money to win a free van? Boo. Drywall is easy. I was just having curry and thinking of your leftover curry. Lol. I found this in my deep freeze. I think its curry. Lol. Thanks for sharing u sunbathing in the Canadian snow!!!! Ps: Luca and Sara know drywall really well.
Awesome, Looking good! I'm ready for next Sunday already. 😊
communist canada, just like the US now, next three masks, no leaving the house, manadatory rfid chips, with sterilization compound vaccine, yeah, it's all good...life is good....
Beans beans they’re good for your heart! The more you eat, the more you fart! The more you fart, the better you feel! So eat your beans at every meal! Lol 😂
This video kind of shows that if you are dedicated no one can stop you for doing what you want!
Check out Vancouver carpenter, he'll show you how to mud and tape.👍🏻
Definitely insulate the interior walls...
love you guys <3
We know you are flat out crazy. It will be a learning experience!!!!!!!!!  TC  Ernest
Well done!
Just woke up to this notification! Heyy E&B💜 fun fact: those are me and my twins initials:))
I love your enthusiasm and can-do attitudes.  You guys really look like you are having fun and enjoying each remodel “win”.  I was cringing watching the trailer-lifting scene having strained my back doing that.  One of your other commenters mention sticking firewood under the tongue...that’s great advice.  I urge you to listen to the majority of the advice-givers. Hire someone to mud and tape.  If you don’t, 1)over-working the mud and 2)putting it on too thick are the biggest mistakes.  But seriously...hire someone.  If you want to feel like you did it yourself, you can sand and finish it. That’s the messy time-consuming part.  BTW...you may want to change out that old sheetrock... especially if it’s wavy. I love your content.
I love your guys videos . Do you guys do a rock, paper , scissor on who picks the music ?   We’re do you find your music ?
Yes, you should have insulated inside as well first. for sound and temp. Believe me privacy is nice.
Please wear safety goggles when putting the plaster on the walls. Its nasty stuff if you get it in your eyes; I'm talking a get to the ER before you go blind job.
Oooh big question! If my email here and my email for Omaze is different and I miraculously won, would that be a problem?? Goodness I hope not! 🤞🙏
So, ya have to donate to enter the drawing?
It looks amazing! You made it look easy. Just love you two.....so adorable.
Good luck mudding and taping. Less experience = more mud = more sanding = more dust!
i like how Eamon listens to "nerd" Bec . For instance, when she read the instructions last week when installing the internet booster, he just went with her directions. i really like that.
i would be insulating the ceilings and between the rooms, keeps home cooler in summer and warmer in winter, AND you can,t hear a fart between your bedroom and guest bedroom. lol
I say go for it. You guys did all that I think you could do the rest. But also, I know nothing about any of this. So maybe don’t listen to me 😂
looking forward to the mudding video (plastering here in the UK), Tried it never again, it's a black art......good luck...:-)
😂😂🙃 You 2 are so funny. Made my Sunday shine
It looks beautiful 😍
Lee always knows best! Look how far you guys have come. Wow 👏🏽
Yay! REROOT IS BACK!! OMG SO EXCITED!
Can't wait to see Kara & Nate and Trent & Allie up at the cottage - and then all go down to Utah to see Trent & Allie's cabin in the mountains.
My 1st job was working at Home Depot and I stayed 11 years. I think you can mud and tape just fine because you can hide any imperfections when you spray texture the walls. You spray the goop and flatten with a trowel to get the look we all know when looking at most walls in any home. I think cutting and hanging would be the hardest and you made it fun especially with math. Have fun and get messy. 😃
Crazy good!
As was said before...thin! I skimmed an entire bathroom ceiling....sanding sucked!!
When mudding keep it light/thin build up if necessary (per my carpenter husband) and taping & mudding are easy compared to the sanding when dry...it gets every where ! Lol wishing you both luck👍
We did dry wall many years ago. We hung it but allowed a professional to tape and mud to cover all imperfections!!! Get a professional!
I always enter the van contests imagine winning that van it's amazing :O
I think mudding and taping is fun 😆
Your not crazy ! My wife and I learned when we did it in our home. Just do research on Youtube on how to do it. You will be fine
!!! When you start the taping and mudding, I recommend you start in the less conspicuous areas so you can practice a bit before doing the main walls. Tip: trying to do a smooth tape job is harder than applying a "textured" job.
drywalling is not that hard. May take a little bit to get the mudding down but you too will pick it up fast.
please re-vamp the kitchen counter top!
Looking great!... Use acoustical sealant instead of  tuck tape for the sealing of your poly vapor barrier.  Dry wall tips hmm, well its pretty easy and the two of you will make it look so :) ... have it nice and warm inside...do a test patch and tape a long joint... use enough mud but little as possible... tools -> mud pan, 3 sizes of trowel knifes, corner trowel (just a cheap one... u only use for taping), drill if you need to mix, mixing paddle, Wallsand Drywall Sandpaper 3-5/16 Inch X11 Inch 150 Grit Handy-Pack (do not use the drywall screen) and a sanding pad........   mud mix to remove air bubbles you could do this in your mud pan by hand for the amount you have->tape->add a skim of mud over top-> trowel (smallest taping knife)and remove access-> let dry-> add another coat (next size bigger taping knife)-> let dry-> last coat use (widest taping knife)->let dry->sand->paint with primer or paint and primer-> fill in any defects->sand-> paint and prime spots->paint last time.... Just remember the more mud you have on the wall the more you have to sand... for any nail holes use the back of your trowel knife and dimple them in and fill.   Looking forward to seeing the results😊
Looking good so far. Next time use glue in the studs before the drywall.  It will help with pops later down the road.   Thanks for the close up of the latter. I’m definitely going to search for one 👍👍
BOB!!!! I miss that guy 😭 also LOL the sunbathing- love it!
My husband and his dad work in construction, and they will do everything they can without hiring the job out except electrical and drywall haha! My husband has had to drywall and mud before, and he has said it's by far the hardest to do! Best of luck, love the spirit!
You guys run the world.
Are you guys going to have a office?
The way I understand it is very hard to get a smooth finish on the mud and tape even the professionals have a hard time with it.
Get a proper mudding set-up.  13" spreader with a trough.  Use a 6" spreader for the 1st layer/ embedding the seam tape.   Use corner bead for outside corners.   Once dry, a light scrape with the 6" spreader to remove any loose or ptiud bits, then a coat with the big spreader to make a smooth transition across all the seams. Let it dry. A light sanding should do it.  I recommend that you get the sanding attachment for your shop vac.  Get the one witha pole.
🇲🇽💜
The bean song in my family.. Beans, Beans a wonderful Fruit The more you eat, the more you toot. Love beans with all your heart. The more you eat the more you fart 'farther noise'
Any Trinity update? Is she safe in storage in Morocco?
Hola! Hey can you tell me where you bought that down neck warmer thing? :)
Eamon and Bec should do a series of workout videos
What you guys do is amazing I'd love to get this it's our ideal to travel
love those guys but videos becoming boooooring.... becides the fact they post it once a week. something is missing... trent and allie work so hard on utube. love  u guys... and sooooory for my words...
Get a drywall screw setter or a drywall gun it’s going to make it so much easier to screw it and when you go to mud it it won’t be a headache
Hey you too I didn't know that you knew Trent and Allie I watch their YouTube video too.😁
You can't get vitamin D if you're complete swathed in clothing, even if it's sunny! lol
skip toweling gives a nice texture and will hide any bad mud job
Props to the mad geometry skills Bec! I'm glad you are there to keep Eamon moving in the right direction! ;-)
When will you be selling your sweaters again??
Nerds!!!!! Yes everytime 🤣🤣🤣❤
Eamon put block under the tongue of that trailer!
You guys did a great job hanging the drywall, but you really should leave the mudding and taping to a professional if you want your walls to look right
Finally get to watch your videos again together with my boyfriend!! 🎉 We haven’t seen each other in 2 months. This is great 🤗🤗🤗
Dude, you need a dimpler for your drill for putting the screws in.
Plastering is mandatory when renovating. Just do it. It's liberating. (She said some 20 rooms later.)
WHY OH WHY?? Are you not insulating the walls? I’m so confused on this?
Let's do it your way and cut to "oops" 🤣😂😂🤣
Yeahhhh bud looks GREAT job well done PROUD OF YAS!!!! L0ve ya guys hope yas have a super blessed week 💕🤲💕
Sailing with the winns?  Same give away?
he probably had covid. it gives you a rush also.
we Canadians can,t fly to Colorado to pick up the van
Thank you for sharing your moments
Also known as whistleberries
Also, do you wish your insulation had been thicker? especially in the summer to keep the house cooler? or you do not know yet? future video topic.
Where is your friend who was helping out? We haven’t seen him in a while!  So love your episodes - I look forward to them every week 🥰
I really like Eamon's glasses!
So amazed as always! Keep tackling those projects! You really inspire me so much! 🥰
Beans beans are good for your heart, the more you eat, the more you fart, the more you fart, the better you feel, soooooo let's eat beans for every meal!  You're welcome!!  You guys are the best🤣
Bec you need to take Eamon to a doctor right now. How did he manage to come out of a hardware store with just 1 item, how did he do this, how? Eamon are you Scottish, a 'wee' triangle bit! Lol. Oh Bec's almost forgot to mention, your skills with power tools and putting screws has improved loads #rightangledude #straightinnomessingabout. Love from Cyprus guys.
i thought the duct work  on the outside looked good! very " Centre Pompidou". but covered is good too.  "Kevin" told " Trent and Allie" that indeed it was the job of the "drywallers" to hide the crookedness of walls. so it was OK if Trent's was building his walls crooked. Trent then reminded Kevin that he was going to be the drywaller. LOL. you can commiserate with Trent on your podcast about it.
Enjoyed every single second of this boring ass drywall!
Where are your boots from? They are super cute
Here in Manitoba we are doing alright with cases so everything just opened back up, but the rules are strict. Glad we finally got out
my dad also put on dry wall for my room. ALONE.. and took a week for him to finish it
Saying as you have’nt done it before 👏👏👏
Lee is the type of friend that everyone needs in their life. 6 people said no, her - GO FOR IT! haha love it
I loved this episode.  Y’all did great on the drywall.  And pulling your back out tryna move the snow plow is probably the most Canadian thing I’ve ever heard.  😂
Be afraid , very afraid ..... hire a mudder!  Seriously..................
Coffee and the usual eamon an bec shenanigans!!!
Beans, beans for sex appeal. 😀
Awesome !😊
You can do it!
My mom and I did the dry wall in her basement. :) Was it easy? Nope. But we had fun doing it together. ;)
Did you insulate the guest bedroom ceiling?
Yes.. come to México..  but covid free please!!! ❤🇲🇽
You can do this yourself, ofcourse! Your going to hate it, but thats the fun hé.
Funny, it(drywall) is not something we do at all in europe. Very interesting to see how houses are so differently built around the world
Hey buddy  Do it but right make shure to  spread like large
I agree. If anyone can do this, it's you two! Do your research, learn, try with a small section that you won't look at all the time... what's the worst that can happen really?  There is no "danger" to trying.
I have always been successful hanging drywall. But my OCD makes tape and mud very time consuming. I’ll still do and it looks great but I lose a year of my life each time. Lol
You guys are getting funnier and cuter every single week!!  🥰 You’ll probably have a huge mess to clean up (mostly due to sanding) after tape and mud, but it’s all for the sake of good content. Lol. These videos are even better than your travels.
Beans beans good for your ❤️ the more you eat the more you 💨 the more you 💨 the better you feel, so eat those beans at every meal 🥘🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
REROOT!!! Sooooooo pumped!! Ps mudding blows, but give it a shot!!
It would be Lee to say "go for it" hahah
Van life would be awesome.  Omg. It would be neet.
Please, for your long term sanity and short term frustration factor, get a mudder.  Not too expensive but your final result will be soooooo much better.  It's a skill that only comes with much practice.
Here to tell you that with enough YouTube help you CAN mud and tape but it does totally suck and it’s very messy.
Nah, NO problem! As long as you don't mud the enitre wall . Just do over screwes and seemes, just to get the walls smothe. I look at a lot of people fixing drywall on Youtube and do not understand why they mud the entire wall🤔. Keep The layers thin and sand inbetween layers. I on the other hand do Wonder why you don't insulate in the walls, to keep noise down. I've done a lot of drywalling , no problemas😅Anyway, you're doing good guys!
Cut the white side first guys! You will get a much cleaner edge. Also make sure the corners are battened or filled with mud when on to brick, if someone leans on it or it gets hit with something the whole finish will crack and need redoing. Do it right first time... Unless you plan on making this video again next year  🤷‍♂️😊
Who runs the world? BEC 😁 LOVED THE VLOG AS USUAL. CAN'T WAIT TO SEE YOU NEXT SUNDAY 😍  Ciao from Italy 🇮🇹
Surely ya's have an Italian friend!??  Those Amico's got muddin in their veins! 🤣🤣🤣
We thought we were superheroes & hung all our own drywall, taped & mudded. All fine & dandy until we painted 🤣 it looks HORRIBLE and now we don’t know how to fix it. I’d leave the mud to a pro so you don’t have garbage seams like us 🤪
Great work guys! 😍😎👌🏻
Back pain is no joke though!! I feel you
Is there a YouTube channel for the podcast?
See you sunday
If you have to drywall more than one room than it's not crazy at all to learn to do it yourself.  If you have the patiences to learn a new skill than it's worth it. Drywalling is a skill so there is a learning curve but if you're motivated than there is no reason you can't do it
Just realize, they call it "mud & tape" but what they mean is SAND...  And you are going to live there while it is being taped, mudded, and sanded. Which means drywall dust everywhere. So go buy 3 or maybe 30 box fans and put air filters on them and plug them into every available outlet.  Change your fancy new HVAC system filters EVERY DAY.  I can see drywall dust pushing Bec over the edge so just prep for the mess friend!
Great job with the drywall, but hire someone to do the mud and tape
Those drone transitions. What an inspiration.
Bec the masseuse girl is working from home....:)
I hope they paint some of the new wall the turquoise color. I like it 😊
At the same spot in our renos, also drywalling. We're also not hiring someone. Good to know we're not the only ones that are crazy enough to tackle this themselves. Good luck!!
🇿🇦♥️♥️
So many laughs! 😂 love it folks! 💛
fantastic video as always guys, keep it up
Good job.
BOB😁😁😁😁😁 we missed u😜
You guys make me smile and a few giggles to... And I definitely need a giggle or two... Thank you so much!!!
Eamon & Bec 1 drywall 0 ..... you won guys!! Proved everyone wrong, best team ever!! Love ya 💚💫
No link to the giveaway?
Impressive .
Might want acoustic insulation between bedrooms....lol
If you want it done right hire someone if you don't mind the cracks and uneaven walls i say go for it yourself
My favorite part of Sunday morning :)
I have done drywall myself with no experience.  It is difficult to make it look great, unless you are planning to texture coat it.  Texture will cover a lot of blemishes. Either way it is very tedious and messy.
Protector no, lol. You get a square line up measure across the bottom and if it’s no to you measure up.
This might sound kind of weird but can someone tell me who sings that song at the beginning of the video? Sound good, can’t find it anywhere
Love forcing my children to watch you guys with me every Sunday!! But where was the pup in the video?!?
cue the circus music for next week..
Nice shades eamon!
I “toot” in every Sunday.I toot in every day 😉
The worse is filling the gaps. Just never done properly , i will remove the dry ceiling for pvc as it is the toilet.
I love how Eamon was measuring with his nipple!!😂😂😂😂 "It's like from here to my nipple... Yeah, it's nipple length!" I can't with you guys hahahaha too funny!!😂😂
good job..))) i like happy people ,,,bec is great..))
I did not read all the comments. You may want to get a dry wall dimpler for your impact driver. If you got a box with multiple drivers you may have one. It will sink the screws to the perfect depth for mud.
Hire out the taping and mudding.  After doing it myself in our rec room, It took me up to four times to get it to look right without bubbles.   It is the one thing I would pay for after renovating my whole house.
I know that town. I am close to you guys. I live near Perth. I assume you want to stay anon. Cheers.
I like they way Lee said it "if anyone can do it, it's u guys" loved watching ur friendship
Why are Americans so scared of drywall?
I'm sure you can do it.  To do it well and fast is an art and skill mastered over time.  I've done much of my own, and got better - but the guys that do it all the time can fly and do it with less sanding/dust.  If I had the dough, I'd have it done - no shame in that.  Or, do just your master bedroom yourself for the experience, and hire the rest out.  You also, I think, have a lot of joints that are butt, not the tapered side.  (Impossible to eliminate all of them).  But, those are harder to mud because you don't have the recess to fill in.  Whatever you do, it will be great.  You are definitely capable and will do a fine job.  In the end, I agree with Bob.  Big electrical and tape/mud - hire out.
Hey buddy.great job on plasterboarding,that's what we call it in the UK.next time use some small off cuts and lay them on the floor and stand your plasterboard sheets on.saves you having to prop them up while fitting them.
I AM SO EXCITED FOR THE PODCAST YOU HAVE NO IDEA!
Heya! I follow Life Uncontained too and they have been doing their home drywall so maybe they can give you tips about it :)
Yayyyy!!! I love this!!  Looking SOOOO GOOD!! ~MAMA TELLE❤️
Very bad
Your doing a great job  keep it going
This much I know, it's messy, if you now how to do it, one day the whole house is done.
great job on the drywall! now you just need a nice paint job done and to brighten up the dark door with some fresh paint. Can't wait to see that done. Have a great week!
My Sundays now consist of my husband asking “did Eamon and Bec post their new video yet?!” Needless to say, we’re addicted. 😎😁👍
you guys got this mudding is not that hard it's just time consuming and messy, good luck
You guys should check out life uncontained
I’m really loving those glasses Eamon 😎!
We did drywall and missing/taping ... drywall was easy, taping x mudding was tricky and messy. Go on THIN and take your time. You can do it. After you do one room it will be so easy to take on the rest. The reason to pay is it’s really time consuming x annoying x messy. Sooooooo maybe it’s worth paying? I’m not a DIYer, so if we can do it ... you can!
Mudding takes many coats and sanding makes a big dusty mess
Awesomeness
It isn't hard to mud and tape...it is time consuming.  Use fibreglass tape.  Much easier...
I remodeled a very old cottage and, as a single mom, I wanted to do the things I could to save on budget. The walls in my bedroom were lath and plaster which was damaged in some areas. With a friend's help, we tackled the job. Applied light layers of plaster, sanding and more plaster...it went on for too long. A contractor friend came over and was admiring the work and said he should hire me and my friend. I said even if he paid us a $1 an hour, he still couldn't afford it because it took so much time. My vote is hire an expert(s). It will save you in the long run.
I reckon after watching this Trent will decide to give it a go himself!!! It’s okay if it’s ‘a hair outta square’ 😎😎
Your cabin is really comeing along I'd say!!!
Eamon's total disregard for math is cracking me up
Yeah.  About the vitamin D.  Here in Canada we are not getting the right wavelength of sunlight to generate enough.   Take at least 1000mg a day.
Amazed keep it up 👍👍
"It's perfect nipple length!"
Watching you two every Sundays renovating your cabin as made me want to do the same with our run down cabin too!! It needs mucho updates
Nice Tshirt eamon😉 .. my home town for the win 🙌🙌🙃
I only live an hour from u
Keep Mossa please!! 😍
I’ve run a drywall company for 20 years. U either have it or u don’t.
There’s this brand name tushy toilet paper. And it’s 100% plant bamboo environment save. They also use the bamboo the pandas don’t like😉. We started using this week and it great. You guys should try it out!!! 💖
What was that song?
Are you guys going to skate on the Rideau Canal? and have a Beaver tail?
Mudding and tapping isn't hard it's just really messy and dusty. As long as you know what you are getting into you will be fine. Be patient. It takes time. But it will feel great when you're done. Happy mudding. Oh yah I hired a guy to do it on our latest remodel.
"I'm a drywall expert" To "oh sh!t" has me in tears 🤣
Do you know how a Jewish housewife make dinner? She makes reservations. You know how Canadian does Tape & mud drywall ? Hey call an expert  ! ! ! 🤷‍✌♂️❤💪👨‍🍳🎅🚌🙏
Even and Katelyn have a good video about how to mud and tape
Always looking forwards to sundays to see you guys!!! It’s part of my routine!
Me: (re)binge listening to Reroot season 1 so I can prepare for more podcast!! 😍🥳
Tip for hooking onto a trailer, when backing up to it apply the ebrake before releasing the foot brake. The vehicle won't move ahead, as the park pin engages.
Until you stared I was wondering what in the name of God was drywall hahaha We call that plasterboard here in Ireland.  Anyway, love the channel guys, has kept me going for the last few months and now in Lockdown 3 here in Ireland we've another 6 weeks to go (until we find out whats happening next) so looking forward to your next video already and going to start listening to your podcast now too.
Y'all are risk takers and I love it !👏🏼👏🏼 that's how we learn
Eamon where are your glasses from? Another great vid! Weather is a little different from where you spent last January 😩😍
It’s starting to look so good and come together , good job guys ! ☺️
I think you are both awesome and seem to have success at most things you attempt. Go for it! And , just think about it, if you fail, it will be a great video......lol. You're welcome You guys can do it!!
Brilliant, love you two.... look forward to this every week.
top 10 worst mudders here but learned get the drywall as even as possible (mud will not cover it up) start with the small spatula then go bigger as you level it out. oh and paint will not cover your mistakes!
You are flat out crazy don't do it
How is Tim doing?
You two did a TERRIFIC job!  Nerds RULE!
Where is the dog?
Haha, my house was built in the 70s as well and also doesn’t have very many square walls. Everyone tells me it’s just how things work but it made installing baseboards... interesting!  Drywall hanging is definitely a DIY in my opinion but I’m with everyone else about mud and tape. It truly is an art form that skilled folks can do so much quicker and easier. I have a couple of patches in my house that we took on ourselves and they aren’t pretty!! Can’t wait to see Mossa in the next video!!
Get this beautiful couple to a million SUBS please!! If anyone deserve it, it’s these two!!!!!!!
Omg Eamon looks gorgeous even more than before ps the dry wall looks amazing
Just donated $5 = 50 entry’s I’m so excited
You won't notice it so much during the day but at night with the lights on you'll see every flaw, and there will be plenty and it will drive you nuts. Good luck 😉
Where is the dog your fostering?
First coat is like the re bar in concreat to fill your joint with sheet Roc 90 Second coat make sure it’s thick amd covers everything use cgc white light compound Sand amd put a final coat on,  this is the skim coat.  Put the skim on and take it off tight to fill air holes.  Finish sand and done.
It is not "hard", although there are tricks. Just tedious depending on how perfect you want it. Thin layers and sand...thinking one thick layer will save you time, will not.
If anyone can do it yous guys can xx what an amazing job you should be super proud....... no more blue walls in the lounge yeah xxxxx
Mudding is so fun...sanding sucks so bad.. if you do a bad job use flat paint it hides everything
Bec with the scalene triangle 🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼 currently watching from the Rochester International airport as our flight is delayed due to a small winter storm ⛈
That's a big job. I take my hat off to you. 😀
My husband always uses a protractor. Bec was right. The more mud the better. We always do more mud than we need because you'll be sending to make it flat so you can paint it.
looking good be safe have fun
Love the weekly videos!! Also, random question but what brand of glasses was Eamon wearing in this video?
Y'all did a great job! It looks so good!
Eamon looks so young with his hair cut short lol
🧰🪜⚒  Well guys, I didn’t doubt y’all’s abilities at ALL...actually when you guys set your mind to do something ...it gets done..Am impressed at all y’all do...I wonder what everyone that told you not to do it thinks now...Anyways I can’t wait to see the finished project I know it’s going to be beautiful...and Bec you are 100% right about the view....stunning...I love y’all’s property...Until next week...Much love ❤️ New Orleans 🎭🎼🎷
I love y’all, and i’m vegan now! It’s the best, feeling awesome
Always listen to the nerd 🤣. First time watching and I loved this
Why not make a big kitchen instead of the guest bedroom?
You guys are awesome! Where’s puppy in this video? Rescued yet?
I hear that all the time.  I’m a drywall taper going on 20 years.  Any questions don’t be afraid to ask.
Great job guys and try tape and mud small coats is better and sand and one more and evaluate.good luck you can do it
I saw a few other comments but thought I'd offer my opinion as a contractor who primarily works on remodeling projects like you have here. Adding insulation in the walls of the guest bedroom would have been good for heat retention and sound barrier, but the opposite side in the kitchen/master bed may still be exposed so you still can put that up. Likewise in the ceiling if you can get to it from the loft.   In terms of mudding (or we call it taping in the States), I have a few recommendations: get a variety of knives (not actual knives, they're more like a flat scraper but we call the knives in my area) in different sizes for applying the compound. I'd recommend a 2", 4" and 8". Having an appropriate sized surface to spread will make a huge difference. Second, put at least three coats of compound on spread out among ~3 days (one coat per day). This part is tedious, but making sure each coat drys before the next goes on is essential. Related, be sure to sand only when the compound is fully dry, and do so between each coat. Also, keep in mind that this next part will make a huge mess as compound easily falls on the ground. Watch your step and clean up as you go to avoid spreading it through your entire home, which becomes a nightmare to clean up (it does NOT clean out of surfaces easily). Best of luck to you!
Don’t they say you don’t usually want your drywall to meet at four corners, so to always offset if you can? Not sure where I read that but it’s living in my brain rent free as I watch this so, take it as you will! Great job though you two!! 💯💯✨
Probably want to check out this guy's tips and tricks for dry wall and mudding and stuff  https://www.youtube.com/c/HomeRenoVisionDIY  You guys are doing great! keep going!
Anybody know what pants/ joggers Eamon is wearing?
I have learned that doing the bottom  dry wall first, gives you a place to rest the upper one it while you screw it in and not have to hold it up. Saving your back from injury.  Bless up!
NAILED IT!!!!!
Large sponge slightly damp is great for feathering the edges, really reduces the amount of sanding. Also use as wide a knife as you can on the second fill.
As soon as you started 12:08 I started singing Let’s get physical by Olivia Newton John 🤣
I love eamon's glasses ❤️. I also love the landscape shots they must take you forever to do.
I just have to ask, how come you don't insulate the walls or ceilings? now you have nothing to deaden sound... love your videos... your land is crazy nice. Good luck with everything
Comment #554 Like #3.3k, I always love their content!
Those glasses are awesome
Great show, love waking up Sunday morning and seeing you guys!!
omg, this hurt my face did they even watch one how to hang drywall videos? lined up every sheet let the cracking begin .always offset the sheets is just the first thing. why are you hanging the top sheet first snap a line put the bottom row in then stack the sheets the mudding is going to be a disaster
You both are awesome! Definitely one of my favourite channels on YouTube. Representing the best of Canada! Would love to help work on the cabin with yous if it weren’t for the pandemic. Looking forward to seeing this cabin turn into something truly yours! :) I love to travel and cook and you both have inspired me to make my own cookbook :)
I knew by the stretching montage this wasn’t going to be good. By the time you didn’t put the nailer in there next to the duct. I knew this was going to be very bad. That joint is going to come apart constantly.
Shouldn't there be insulation in wall 4, behind the giprock? But I have no experience, so probably wrong.
My husband and I tune in every Sunday and watch while eating your avocado toast recipe ❤️
Soooo pumped about reroot!! My all time favorite podcast without a doubt. Thanks for bringing it back!
Bob 🥰❤️🥰❤️
No one told my husband how hard dry walking is, so he was happy that everyone told you the truth 😂
LOVE what you are doing! I wonder why you aren't putting sound insulation between floors (ceiling of guest bedroom) and walls (between kitchen and guest bedroom) and walls between guest bedroom and master bedroom?  Also I taped drywall for an entire summer ...be prepared to be covered in the mud and weigh 20-25 lbs more each night! I think taping/mudding drywall in the summer is one thing (can always hose off outside before showering) but taping/mudding in the winter means you better know how to clean your pipes easily. All the best!
Who run the world? Nerds! Loved it!
🌿 Positive vibes to my favorite Sunday morning routine‼☕(Drywall sucks)😁 Why no insulation?🤔 #davesandersstepdaughter
You can do the taping and mud. But it won’t look good. It’s a real skill to do it well. I say respect the skilled laborers!
I love you guys🥰 I smile I laugh!! Thank you for that👍🏼🙏🏼❤️
It's coming along!
Love Bob's facial hair.  It's a new look for him.
KEEP GOING GUYS!!!!! its a great sense of accomplishment when you can tell people "I dyrwalled and mudded" myself
Nice job!!!!! Has anyone told Eamon that he looks like Anthony Kiedis from the Red Hot Chili Peppers when he wears that baseball cap👍🏻🤣
I did some drywall years ago (I’m 75 now) when we lived in a communal house. My job was taping and mudding. No one told me it was difficult. I just did it. There was a learning curve. Best advice: mud it thinly. You will have to mud several times and putting it on thick doesn’t decrease the number of times you do it. It does increase the amount of sanding and subsequent dust when you put it on thick.
We totally forgot who we were dealing with when we told you not to do this...straight up professionals!! 👏🏼😍
My partner and I have always done all of our own drywall.  It's messy and a pain when you are living there at the same time, but totally worth it to save the money and have the satisfaction of doing the work yourselves!
Your flat crazy, but we love so much!❤👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Hey both buddies , you make my sundays with your videos and today after three days struggling with the lockdown your vlog made my day . Spending the day studying and have you vlogs in the background x thanks x from mollie in Cambridge England xxx
you guys did a GREAT job!! TIP for mudding: 1. Buy the "dust control" mud 2. Add water to the mudding mixture (1/3 of over-all weight).. it will make application WAY EASIER!!! and then you have less to sand down :)
Definitely hire someone to mud (or plaster as we say in the UK) if you want a good finish
Love your videos!
We totally dry walled our house in 1994, to cover up 1960’s paneling. Then in the mid-2000’s we drywalled our basement ceiling. I say go for it. Mudding is a pain but it’s doable. Totally. You’re young, enthusiastic, and capable. What else do you have to do right now? It’s not like you’re going anywhere anytime soon, right? Love what you’re doing! Lots of love to you both from the Thumb of Michigan!
Love your show
You can tape and mud.     Just learn how to do it and practice on your least visible wall. A good job = way less effort, so try to do it right.
Just my humble opinion....based on experience.  I am a DIYer as well.  I have learned to have experts mud and tape.  Mudding and taping is easy but DIYers tend to over mud to make it look good and functional......BUT over-mudding creates a sanding issue.  If you over mud and sand to make smooth then your house will be a dusty mess for months.
I’ve never mud and taped but I’m with Lee - if anyone can do it, you can!!
When Eamon said "the sympathy is so low with you" I felt that!  PSA: Men feel pain too, Men suffer too, men deserve sympathy when they're in pain too..!
the serotonin i get from these videos is unmatched <3
I love sundays 💞
brilliant! Takes me back to my first home...in love and 5 year reno.
See? Drywall ain’t so tough. The taping and mudding will make you crazy if you are seeking perfection. I know this from how ours turned out.
I love watching your videos so much! You guys are the ones who inspired me to try out van life! As soon as I finish high school I am hitting the road!
I love your guys video thanks for deciding to share all your fun adventures!
My 5 foot 2 inch daughter dry walled and taped her garage by her self and it looks great. She did not know anything about it either. Go for it guys.
Hey. Guyswe also have one of those headers that we bang our heads on and we etched it out no more head banging on the header
When you guys have been building, have you been getting permits or looking at 'building code'? Or for the work you guys are doing, does it not really apply? That stuff always spooks me when we decide to do something in the house! LOVE your vidssss and all its Canadiana vibes <3
Love you guys! Eamon please get the massage and the damn Advil Bro! 😂🙌🏾🤎
Bec is like Amy Santiago from brooklyn 99
Who was everyone on the calls?  I know a couple of them but if the rest have channels I want to check them out.
We've been renovating our house by ourselves and did all the drywall alone, definitely do at least 2 thin layers of mud! Sand in between and use tape to prevent cracking down the road!
Westport is awesome in the summer!!!!
Bravo!!
Haha introvert who takes her time and gathers all the info versus an extrovert who ploughs ahead and doesn't listen....I can relate 😂😂
If anyone can do it, you guys can!  Don't be out off.... You'll get the hang of it pretty quickly!
Eamon, you should have also FaceTimed Nate Buchanan, Christian Matney and Chase of Tío Aventura as well and get their opinions regarding drywall and mudding.
I like how you just trust and go for it.
Hahaha the sunbathing 😂 love you guys. The cabin is coming along so nicely!
You need a drywall dimpler for putting the screws in
Wow! What a difference with the drywall! Looks awesome 😁
I’m almost shocked Trent said he was going to hire someone! Meanwhile on his channel....”I told Eamon I was going to hire someone to mud and tape...but nope, doing it myself!”
Research some "how to" instructions on mudding the drywall . . and OBEY those instructions. DO NOT lay it on thick expecting to sand it down!!! that makes for murderous levels of labor and choking dust!  A few LIGHT layers done right means very little sanding. Take your time, do it right, and it's very light work. Trust me, this amateur knows well the WRONG WAY!  P.S.: Please lose that awful rap music. Bleah!
I got tired of waiting for a pro to start the job so I started to mud and tape myself when I was finishing my basement.  It just took the pro extra time to fix what I did.  It will take a pro so much less time to get the job done and then you can start painting.
Cover up everything if you don't want drywall dust everywhere and just take your time taping and mudding you got this life is not a race!!!!
Mudding and then sanding is the worst part of drywalling, if you guys are totally going for it watch a bunch of videos and maybe talk to someone whose done it a lot. But you got this!!!
I taped and mudded my bathroom by my self. Turned out great. Previous comment is true... thin is in. keep it smooth, less sanding. Your's is just gonna be a big job. But you can do it!!! On a side note, maybe see a chiropractor for your back and get some relief... Eamon, your glasses look great. See ya next Sunday!❤❤❤
You two are so brave!  Nice work.  From a fan in Ottawa.
yes get a professional to mud a tape.  takes a lot of patients and once you paint you see all the imperfections
Sitting here watching you guys work your butts off instead of working on my bathroom.  It's not the skimming, it's the sanding I hate.... Sigh!  I'm goin.............😔
Sunday’s are the best day of the week, cuz it’s the day Eamon&Bec comes out. You 2 can do anything 😀
Wow guys! You rock. You showed that drywall who’s boss. Good luck  finishing up the taping. I know you can do it.
Less is better with the mudding because sanding is messy and it sucks.
You guys are great!  I love watching and I’m pretty impressed with your skills.  You say you don’t know how, but it’s looking amazing!  I say great job!
Did y'all insulate the ceiling?
You guys should do a video where you aren't getting along. You have to bicker every once in a while.
Just discovered the channel last week, feel like i missed so much fun stuff in the past years! Now I need my Sunday fix
I hate to break it to you, but the taping and mudding are the hard part. Really hard to make it look professional.
Have never commented on anything on YouTube but have appreciated you guys for so long...my opinion, do not mud and tape. Get away for 3-4 days and let the professionals come in and get it done. It will preserve your lungs, backs and relationship.
Need some insulation between those walls or you and your guest will hear everything and I mean everything you say and do.
Oh vey u guys can do anything 🤠
I converted my garage into a room, drywall & mud taped joints . No Experience just watch a few YouTube videos it worked out great a solid 8/10 score saved a fortune .
I use your videos to keep track of the day of the week lmao
Looking awesome!
Good job! I was wondering why you didn't put any insulation between rooms... I'm totally not a handy person so I really am just curious, I can't offer any advice! I will say that my sister in law put up drywall in their home and did the mudding and taping... and she swore never again. But, I am sure you'll do just fine!!!
You can do it. You need three GOOD quality putty knives, 4", 6" and a 9". Go thin coats and take your time. Start with the thinner and work out to the wider. A corner knife is needed as well. Don't forget to get the corner beads nice and straight. Sanding is the exercise. I would try the guest room first to see if you can do it. If not have the pros come in and finish it.
If you tape and mud yourself use mesh tape, and a textured paint...it helps cover the mudding errors...from experience 🤣😂🤣 Also, learn how to feather the edges...you tube videos😂🤣
You should paint the inside of the living room door white, would look great :)
You guys are doing great!  Keep it up!!
Oh I loved this one. Great to see the joy in your step Bec! I bought your cookbook today for that soup! Yum🌱🌱🌱🌱
You don't need protractor to do the triangle you need to  use a very wonderful topic of mathematics which none of us loved in school and that is TRIGONOMETRY.  Remember??
Not crazy drywalling. You guys got this. Just measure twice before cutting.
Happy Sunday!! Loving the cabin, good luck with trying to mud and tape 😂
I loved that you both called Lee when you wanted someone to tell you what you wanted to hear! I do the same thing with my friends, call the person you know will agree with you when you want a second opinion. Can't wait to watch you mud and tape next week! I know you'll hit it out of the park!
Love your videos. I'm quite a handy guy & haven't come across much I can;t handle. Not into having someone else do what I can do. I've drywalled before. Want my opinion? OK. lol. HIRE someone to mud & sand!!!! It's not something you watch Youtube to figure out. Sure it looks easy enough. It's an art. You'll have to look at it everywhere you go in your house. If you had lots of body shop experience I'd say hell ya go for it. Remember I said I'd done it before...ONCE & never again & I have worked in a body shop!! Good luck. LMAO
Omggggg it would be so cool to win the van! I’m located in buffalo ny and would deff travel to see you too!
Make sure when you mud to remove as much of the excess mud while it is still wet.. The worst part is the sanding down to make it smooth! If you leave it thick... takes longer to sand..
First off, I love watching you guys. Your make an adorable team.  Second, as an amature builder, drywall  is not that hard. As long as your prepared for the messy part. Just dive in. You guys can tackle this project no problem.  I have faith.
My husband is a contractor and we live in Waterloo if you ever need a hand 🥰
The only advice I have on mudding and taping is when u mud, always do thin coats, that way it drys faster, easy to sand down after, it is defiantly one of the hardest things to do 😁 good luck guys!! You are amazing! Such an inspiration!! 💕💕
When will the “see your Monday merch” be back in stock??
Admire all you are DIY’ing.  There is definitely a skill involved in hanging drywall (try to avoid seams at the corners of doors/windows) and mudding is a skill onto itself.  Many years, many attempts, many homes I can do it pass-ably, but hiring a skilled mudder before the first layer, is where I go now, to me, worth every penny, in time, efficiency and effort.   Especially the high portions, watching a skilled drywall person (often on stilts) makes you realize why you didn’t do it yourself.   But sure, give it a go......... ❤️🙏👍
Check out the Vancouver Carpenter for great muddling tips
I drywalled (w/ tape and skim coating) my entire house (3 br 1 ba) alone. I am 5'2. Just watched a lot of you tube! If I can do it, you two can!!👍
drywall came out perfecto if you can build two vans you can do anything except put the hitch on the back of that truck bye guys love you see you next Sunday by the way todays my birthday
I love you, guys! Amazing energy!👏🦋
Have fun doing all that mud. Good luck.
Definitely NOT crazy. We plan to do this on spring to build me a crafting space. :) I have watched another youtube channel do it and it does look tedious buy doable. Wabi-Sabi. Might be worth a look. They're renovating an old farm house. ;)
You guys... HEROES
Go with Trents advice ❤️
Save your back and install a "Bulldog" jack with a wheel on your trailer. Crank to lift  and lower your hitch, flips out of the way when you travel. Best investment for any trailer owner and not that expensive, around $40 USD.
Crazy to mud and tape.....definitely hire that done....just my opinion
Eamon trying to get the trailer hitched was hilarious 😂👌👏 Good job though!!
a2+b2=c2 Eamon 😂😂😂
I'm gonna make some popcorn for next week 🤣😂🤣  You guys are the awesomest 😎💖🙏
Do it eamon! We wouldnt have any drywallers in the world if everyone thought it was too hard.. you will learn it .. just like everything else..
Brilliant as always 🤘🏻 I wouldn’t mind that drive to the post office 😍🚐
Love the cameos, especially Bob and Trent!
“Who runs the world? Nerds”
This guy has some great drywall tips:Taping and Mudding 101 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIvmfBuAQIw
My husband is a builder and epert dry waller  Never run the seams verticle aslong the door or window. because it will crack when you put a small piece above the door or window.  you cut the drywall at least 4" over the window or door.  For mud and tape it will be easier for you to use fiberglass tape vs paper tape.  Don't put too much mud on is the key.  Also plastic vapor barrier is not the best choice due to mold growth .
Great job on the drywall guys! Mudding and tapping is not as bad as everyone says. Do three thin coats and tape every seam. Get the right tools for the job. Good luck! Can't wait to see the finished job!
I always liked mudding and taping; if I can do it - ya’ll sure can! Do thin dabs of mud, let it dry. It will shrink, layer another coat. Put the metal edging over outside corners for damage control.  And, if you use nice soft layers of mud, and do not goop it too much, you can smooth the mud with a slightly damp 🧽 instead of sanding. Much cleaner.
Love you guys and love your vid as well ❤️😘
Love the bean reference
Eamon & Bec be like :   if the drywall professionals can do it.. we can do it 😂😂 proud of you
Nerd :) wins again :)
I LOVE YOU GUYS!!!!
Drywall is fun but it’s nice to be taught some tips. Boarding can be hard work. Taping is enjoyable. Sanding not so fun 😁. You’ve got all winter, DO IT! Don’t put the mud on thick! Thin coats spread wide means less sanding/dust.
'We will try anything once.' I think you should try letting a fan from the U.K come over, skim (mud) your walls for you, and pay me in food and lodgings in your  paradise that you call home. 😂
Amazing job though! It's certainly not easy but you did it anyway. Those sheets are heavy as f*ck so I applauded your excellent work :)  Go for mud and tape too! Unless you're impatient like I was and don't have a wide enough scraper thingy it's not too difficult. Just frustrating to do it properly. Imo the drywall itself is the harder part.  But either I'm living in denial or my dad is a drywall magician because I don't remember it being unmanageable to do yourself when I drywalled my bedroom last year. Maybe because our sheets came in full length from floor to ceiling? I thought it was the norm to do it yourself, or maybe Swedes are just weird, or my family is stubborn fools... I'm probably living in denial...
Good job! We are renovating our house and are currently finishing the mudding of the drywall in our bedroom. It really is possible! You might need a few more layers than a pro would, but really, just go for it! If we could do it, so can you!
Hey Eamon, you should put ceramic car coating on your xplornet dish which means you won't need to go up on the roof so often.  Hope you see this as it would help you out a little.
😂😂 seriously love you guys!
if you live in the back 40, drywall is a thing,  its like living in muskoka, and never drywalled, you're called a citiot.   eamon; like they say in the furniture business, sofa-so-good
I love you guys
With mudding do you go over the whole wall or just the joints? I'm a plasterer or mudder in the UK and we call it skimming if you're going over the whole wall and tape and jointing if you just go over the joints
Good Grief, you keep saying it's only a small cabin... it's larger than my 3 bed house in the UK! hahahahahaha.... The envy is great! :D  Keep going guys, I always like to do everything my self too,  live and learn, always worth it to me! Good luck.
I loved that gilmore girls reference! definitely my fav show ever❤️
The Drywall up gets me so excited to see how you guys decorate the cabin!!
My cousin did all of his own dry wall. said it was a lot of work but never even thought twice about not hiring someone.
Eamon...you can do anything with your nerd!!!💕💕
Life uncontained are doing drywall see what they do they know as much as you do.
Ceiling pros except for Aimee and Craig's 😂
You guys did an awesome job!!!
Boarding: Easy.  Mudding & Taping: Sculpture and Artistry for the unforgiving.  But give it a try in small area 1st - it's the E&B way after all.  Just don't do what I did and do the entire floor.  Makes it more expensive for the pro you hire later to fix your work. 😂
If Trent says no I wouldn't do it.
I would never mud drywall. I've hung plenty but way more goes into taping and mudding.  And you will hate looking at it everyday if the job isn't done right.
i feel like i was the only one who joins in when e&b start dancing around and doing exercise
Really good job!! Still can't get used to Eamon with short hair!  🤣 take care x
It might be to late, but you want to stagger the drywall so the seams don't crack.
Drywall is easy but only if you don’t put too much mud on. Thin coats is best. The hard part is the sanding. So keep it thin and then you won’t need to sand much at the end.
Best thing I've watched all week! 🥰
idk i'm 15 and I put drywall up with my dad it wasn't that bad haha
We all knew they were still going to try to dry wall 😂
So my dad has been building houses all my life and I learned to drywall and paint at age 6 y’all can definitely do it!
This is great, happy, motivational video like always! And it was great to see you on the Instagram live with Craig and Aimee this week too! I hope you have a great day:)
So motivating , we also got a cottage in 2019 that is in similar state minus plumbing and electrical, permits are such a headache 🤕 but we want to do everything correctly so we don’t run into problems!  Did you guys have a hard time being on waterfront as well?  We are in lanark .   Love the videos we’ve been following along since the birth of trinity xo
Should insulate the interior wall with Roxul...it will keep the rambunctious shagging noises dulled down for the camp..
If Milwaukie colors were green , you’d be Luigi💚💚
My husband and his brother drywalled their parents entire basement themselves and then my sister-in-law my husband my brother-in-law and I all did the mudding and painting we had no experience we just jumped in and did it that worked out just fine it really wasn't that hard but you do need more than one person someone to help hold it up and someone to help nail it.
Okay, but your can do attitudes is what I need in 2021. You guys killed it 👌
Drywall install is no big deal but the taping and mudding can be tedious! It can be a long process to get it right. Get ready Bec, you'll love this part!
How to do it is really easy...  Pay someone else to tackle that nightmare...
Hello beautiful Bec your place is looking good
Look at you guys go! Great video and I’m excited to watch next week. 😃
Taping and mudding: If you love seeing all your "custom touches" and want them to always remind you of the wonderful times working together on the cabin, go for it. If you have enough memories of wonderful times, and you don't want to ruin them with nightmares of taping and mudding in your sleep FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIVES, I'd go with hiring it out.  : /
I absolutely love  the drywall process makes you feel like the finishing point is near.
love the Gilmore girls shoutout :))
Guys is the giveaway international!?!? Sick vlog as always btw
I’m in Trenton Ontario if you need help! With tape and mud
HEYO BEST PART OF THE WEEK!!!!! Happy happy sunday friends, have a great week
I love you guys.i wish I was as confident as you
Loving the new sunnies Eamon! I love how you two always seem to have such a good time even when you're tackling big scary projects! :)
Tape and mud is my favorite part!  Sanding is not much fun.  Try and keep the sanding to a min by putting on the mud smoothly.
The more I see what you do, the more I also want to buy a cabin and renovate it by my own! Greetings from Germany :)
The ‘Beans Beans’ song had me giggling! My dad taught me this song! I am pretty sure it is a dad song pass along!
THE PODCAST!!!!
Your positive attitudes are astounding. You have my deepest empathy to endure rennovations while living amongst it all. I was a teenager when my mom rennovated our home and we lived in a house flip for 5+ years. Dry wall, plumbing, foundation fixing, etc. It is emotionally taxing for sure but your enthusiasm is inspiring 🌈✨💙 see you sunday
i was thinking about listening to your podcast and i was wondering whats it about?
Whoever edited this is legit..
Westport is such a cute little village. Pre-Covid, we would take a drive in the summer & check out all the little stores. Hit up the ice cream shoppe & walk down to the water.
So excited for reroot to come back! Can’t wait ti continue my tradition of listening to them before work
so close to 1mil
I do a lot of plastering on film/tv sets as a scenic artist here in the GTA.... it’s not that hard... I have all the confidence that you’ll both be able to tackle it, no problem!!! Thanks for another great video 😊
Protractor/contractor. .. either/or 😂😂😂
You are crazy.  My only tip for mudding and taping is: less is more.  If you don't like putting the mud on in the first place, you really aren't going to like having to sand it all back down flat.
Taping and mudding sucks. You can do it but you probably won’t be happy with the end result. Hire a taper. You will be glad you did. Keep on boarding though, who needs a protractor!😂😂💕🇨🇦
I would check out Ottawa Builder. He does a lot of DIY videos and has a whole drywall series that's brilliant and saved me a ton of time and headache! He gives you good tips on spreading tips, drying time, taping methods, shortcuts, etc. I would also look at Mr. Build It drywall tips. He talks about the perfect consistency to mix the mud to to make it easier to spread. Like ketchup or sour cream. And there are different grades of mud you can buy to mix. Some are harder to sand smooth than others after they dry.
Look up Joshua Alexander, he is in Canada, he is an artist but does drywall for extra money. Look up DIYfferent, Doug has redone several houses they have lived in. He redid everything in the house they own now. You can get bathroom and kitchen ideas and how tos from him.
Don’t mud and tape yourself 😅
Best start to the week! Can’t wait for reroot season 2!
I have done drywall for over 30 years. You need to stagger your sheets and if possible install full sheets on the walls. Less chance for multiple cracks later on down the road. You need to get an adapter for your screw gun for the screws. If put into deep, you will have pop screws after awhile. When taping, use paper tape only. No mesh tape. Use all purpose compound for coating, especially the base coat. Do not use the gimmick easy sand compound. Put 3 coats on the joints. The last coat, mix down the compound to a consistency of putty.  This will help even out all your mistakes . Ask a question anytime. Good luck.
Hire someone to mud and tape. The sanding is the nasty part... drywall sanding dust is evil.
Love the vlogs! Can you win the van if you’re not from America? (from Sweden)
Stayed up till 3 am to watch this in Aus, did not disappoint, been waiting for this video since you first showed the cabin!
Don’t put the mud on thick remember the thicker it is the more you sand thinner means more coats but less sanding
Thanks for the tour, it really put everything into perspective! As for drywall, my brother is Class A contractor and I have seen him tape and mud, would not attempt after seeing the expertise! I did not realize the master and guest room share a wall, would have absolutely done something to help soundproof....
Go for it guys! Plastering as we call It in the UK looks lovely and rustic when it’s not so perfect. My husband and I have just completed our barn and we dry walled and taped and mud? Do you call it? It’s not perfect but then neither are we!!!
Hair out of square!  Just like your BFF's!!
Great work guys.  I think you may find the "tape and jointing" (as we would call it in the UK) a different matter and very dusty.  I would consider having the walls skimmed by a plasterer the finish would be so much better.  Don't forget to put some plastic sheeting down to protect the floor.  See you next week...
Your doing great 👍 you make our Sundays sooo much better 😃
not crazy for mudding yourselves. tips... small layers of mud passed by multiple times is easier to work with then heavy layers. for the corner you created around the went add a metal corner to solidify the corner (they sell some with tape added to it too), when sanding have a damp towel and pass it on the wall before you sand (this will help the dust fall and not fly away), be patient and breath, after sanding check with your hand. good luck!!!!!
don't do it. a big mess
Pro Tip: Score the drywall on the front side, break, then cut the paper side from the back for cleaner cuts.
Don’t be afraid of the taping and muddying. The key is to do lots of very thin layers and don’t rush Eamon.
Just tear middle wall down and make it a huge master and cover up door next to kitchen 👀
Neeeerds 🤘
WAIT A PODCAST OMFG NOW I CAN HAVE EAMON AND BECK TWICE A WEEK
What happened to the guy who was helping you??
I love ur videos ☺️❤️
Eamon...maybe you should consider wearing a back brace/support while your working!!!💕
Dry wall?...this is the 3rd channel I am watching doing the dry wall. Life Uncontained started it, next was MBF-Modern Homesteading, and now  Eamon & Bec 😊
i agree mudding sucks, but if you're going to do it anyway....... (because I still do too)  1)apply think mud on joint, 2)cut paper tape to length and get it wet (not dripping wet but flexible) 3)press over the joint 4( apply a thin layer of mud over the tape a smooth out ( use a wide knife for this, 6 to 10 inches) 5) walk a way no no don't touch it walk a way let id dry!    Next day ... light sand and apply a thined out layer of mud as needed.  and again walk a way. .... rinse and repeat as needed.     P.S.  Love watching you two!
Good job guys! Mud and tape.....I have done this.....don’t know why it’s a big deal. Piece of cake.
I wish, your channel has bigger thumbs up button, this one is not enough :) You re way more amazing than you could image!
After many many many attempts with taping and muddling(yes, muddling) DO NOT do this yourself  End product will be fat superior with a hired pro Just sayin
Yes yes yessssss Sunday!!!!
Great work, the cabin is really coming on nice,, great team work.
I've been re watching your Morocco travels to stay warm. 🤣🤣
Good luck mudding hanging dry wall is hard work but the easiest part of the job in my opinion. Mudding and floating is all about touch
Thank you so much for the tour! I can totally see your space in my mind now 💋
Good Going! 👌🏾👌🏾 #FaceItAndFixit
The beans should propel Eamon  thru the day.....
Who runs the world - nerds. I was so with you on this one, Bec. We saw it coming. Lmao 😂
Eamon, dude I legit threw my back out too trying to move a washing machine. It has been one hell of a January. Did the massage work? Get better soon!
Ahhhhhh YOUR VIDEOS BRING SO MUCH JOY INTO MY LIFE!
I have been waiting so long for the dry wall! Feels like a personal win, haha. Enjoy those beatiful crisp sheets, guys <3
Just entered the giveaway 🤩 fingers crossed! We would LOVE to win a van! Thanks for running such an awesome giveaway guys 😄
Mudding....good enough... easy. Not!
Hey Guys when you go to start to Mud and Tape,Keep in mind "Thin is in " You may have to do a few more coats,But you'll have a much easier time Sanding, Good Luck<Can't wait to see the Finish.
I spied VanWives wearing your #SeeYouSunday ☀️ hoodies this morning 👀
my mom and my dream is for both of us to be livin van life together ! (separate  vans ofc) but i cannot wait ! i’m already saving up money so once i graduate i can leave asap! i’d love to win. but i am out of money lol. better luck next time !! anyways lovee your videos and hope to meet you on the road sometime !
I would have looked in to combining the two downstairs rooms for a bigger master bedroom
Eamon and Bec makes everything seem so easy, love you guys and your vids.
That was awesome.  You both did good for your first time.  I’m really liking the cabin.  Very rad. 🤙🏻 Also, where was Mossa?
Can't wait to see the end of your home project 😬😍
Mud it yourself. Eamon can do everything!
Nerd here - they never listen to us Bec until they’re out of ideas. Also, as someone that just went through drywall/mudding torture for sure hire someone. You’ll be so thankful you did when you don’t spend hours sanding after trying it yourself! See ya Sunday! 🥰
should of used a protractor 😅
Dude,  before you drop the tongue of the trailer back on the ground, stand a pce of firewood on end under it 👍.
What a fun video 😁❤️
I have one tip, wet sand your mud.
Re-root: Subscribed!!
Umm just set the trailer hitch on some cinder blocks or get a cone on Amazon for such things that you can set it on.  LOL, too funny.  Also mudding sucks!  Now I just pay them to do it and it gets done so fast.  Totally worth paying someone.
Great episode! Love the optimism you both have! ❤️
i love you guys so much, you should have your own tv show, never a lack of funny content! look forward to next sunday
Always the perfect way to spend my Sunday- Eamon and Bec, matcha latte, and kitty company! 🥰✨
Skip the mudding and taping. LOL you're welcome
You guy are killing it! Now let's see if you do the mudding yourselves or if you source it out? Great job!
My fiance has started watching your videos with me every now and then, and my favourite part is when he comments on the handy work (and all of the things that are being done wrong or should be considered, like the size of the drywall and various technical things that I have no idea about). I just tell him its FINE, you guys always figure it out, even if you make a few mistakes along the way 😅
Omg!!!!! So impressed, but knew you two would get it done!!!!
no dog yet
Mudding and taping not fun, but once its done its done!! Enjoy!
About to enjoy some coffee and take this in! Love this Sunday ritual! Much love guys!
I always love a new Sunday because I can see a new eamon and bec video ✌🏼✌🏼
Do not mud and tape, you may complete it and it may look "ok" but you will see every single imperfection when you paint and it will start to peel after time. Pay a professional for the mud and tape.
My fav is. by far Trent's reaction.
OK I'll ask you in this episode :D since you didn't check my comment on last week's video :-( :-p "I wanted to ask this for a while now but what brand are your boots? where can I find some :-D  I need new ones and wanted to know if they are vegan or are those from before you guys turn vegan"
Bob rocking the beard! Solid!
I love Sundays!! Your videos have turned into a ritual at our house. My boyfriend would kill to have your Milwaukee tool collection 😂
Ya’ll are the best! I knew you could do it!! PS. What program did ya’ll use to make your animated intro??
When covids over il fly out from swanage in England and plaster it for you! British style 😉
All you need is one person to tell you you can do it and it’s on.. of course lee is always that person 😂    The quality of your Vlogs is getting better and better! I’ve been watching your videos for the last 3 years and watched all of your videos too many times to count and you can see where the improvements happened each time but recently it’s just been a constant step up in quality and you guys should be proud! the mil subs are gonna happen in no time at this rate :)   Can’t wait to see your journey this year! 👏🏻
Hahaha my husband is currently attempting to drywall our laundry room so we feel your pain! Good luck this week!
😂 you guys are hilarious!
Drywall : easy  Mud & Tape : A master skill only for artists ! hahahaha 😂 #truff
For mudding: Make sure you put a little amount a a time. Dans every layer. You'll know when the mudding is perfect when you close your eyes and pass your hand on the mudding and you do not feel a dent or a hole. It has to be straight. Good luck!
Flat out crazy to mud yourself???  Good luck!!!!!
Honestly mudding and taping isn't too bad it's the sanding after words to make it smooth to blend it all together. Just make sure your drywall is consistently like toothpaste
You guys need to wear particle respirator masks!!! Really bad for the Lungs!!!! Stay safe guys.
BOB!
Too bad the guest bedroom is near the bathrooms and not the master.
mud and tapping isn't that complicated
It’s looking great! UK version: beans beans are good for your heart. The more you eat the more you fart. The more you fart, the more you run. Eat more beans, it’s so much fun 😁. Looking forward to next week guys x
Don’t let anybody tell you not to do something, best to try and fail than never to have tried at all, You two are brilliant, love watching your videos Xx
You guys definitely make Sundays Fundays!!! Great job nerds! 🤓 🤓. Who runs the world Nerds!!! Great job so far, keep doing what you do!!!
Y'all are living my dream life. Love the vids
Is there any thing that Damon can’t do but good job looking forward to next Sunday
OMG, the edition when Eamon is trying to place the pull car is the best.
No matter who does the taping and mudding, cover everything! I mean everything. Sawdust is nothing compared to the fine grit from sanding the mudding! We found that out really quick. Good job you guys!
Miss Bob
Thank you for the walk through, maybe I have ocd or something but it was giving me anxiety not understanding the layout, lol
Remodeling a cabin with nerd and buddy! You two make my Sundays. 🙂
Just heard that you guys were in the comments section so A BIIGGGG HIIIIII
See you Sunday. Do you know when your t shirts and hoodies will be back in stock please ❤
Where are your boots from? I also see vanwives wearing them?!?
"Is there any thing he can't do?" Eamon is the best!
I love your "can do" attitude! What you don't attempt closes down what you will attempt...which then leads you to live in a box! Good job👏👏👏👏👏
Hi everyone!!!!! God bless
Guys fit the dry wall verticale, not horizontal. As there is a feather edge on both long sides of the dry wall sheet it makes it much easier to mud and feather when these too feathered edges are adjoining each other.  The top and bottom edges, which have no feather, are then covered by skirting and molding at the top ;). Mudding is easy, just takes a bit of practice, go for it :)
So I don't have any experience of building anything but I've been wondering...don't you need to kind of insulated the ceiling? Or is that ok?
It's starting to take shape!! These videos are always so we'll edited
you guys are normally so on point ... But Hovering today .. not so much :)  10:45
YESSS I am LIVING for these renovation videos!!! Do you guys think you'll ever do freestyle Fridays again?? Cabin version?! They have helped me so so much as I am a very visual learner and LOVE cooking now! Also, my whole family is vegetarian now and I never thought I'd see the day! We have your cookbook too. Love you guys and I am hoping & praying for some more freestyle Fridays in the cabin!!
Am happy
every day im chacking youtube if something new post from youuuu ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Loving being able to follow this journey ❤️❤️
Yes, the Determination is awesome! Love you guys and the vids!
First.....heh I just signed up for that van.
Hey guys! Love your videos where are your bed sheets from they are so cute!!!
Where is your cabin
Love you guys! Favorite part of my Sunday
Haha I love how supportive Lee is! Like "if anyone can do it, it's you" 🤙
I'm excited to "hear" the podcast. Listen? Ya listen to the podcast. Bwahaha.
love youuuu guyysssss ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🌹🌹🌹
The best part of the week is this vlog
guest room for subscribers? haha jk..kinda :) awesome to see the work all coming together
I am SO excited to hear you have a podcast! I cannot wait to listen! Have a great Sunday!
I literally start my sundays with your vlogs🥰
I absolutely love small towns. My husband is from a small town in Maine and it is a cozy little town. I love to go for rides when I am there and see the beauty in every small town.
Speaking of Morocco, are you guys worried about trinity?!? She’s been there for almost a year.  😢
I am so excited to see this today! Yesterday I spent half the day thinking it was Sunday and was very disappointed when I realized it wasn't!!!! You guys make my weeks complete!!!!!!! <3
There is a drywall screwdriver tip you can buy to help inset the screws. You will thank me later when you mud.
Happy Sunday, hear you Monday!
Guys I love you! Honestly you inspire me so much ❤❤
The post office opening though haha
edit in: i havent deleted my initial comment but i have put tips from 20yrs of work in the field in the comment  i wish theyd contacted me, not that they would/could, iv had 2decades of residential/commercial drywall exp including mud work ... its _easy_ ... of all the aspects of construction drywall is the least stressful the mud can be applied with no more than 3 of the blades used, a damp sponge the day after to let the mud dry overnight and no need for sanding to make smooth easy easy work and if you can read a tape and know the stud centering its stupid simple ... in a 30min convo i can explain to all but the most dense how to get perfect joints with 5min practice on scrap material edit in, the time wasted making the 2nd cuts on the drywall is very rookie and hilarious, score break and snap off  mudding tips. thin out the mud a tiny bit. do it per tray not per box. i.e. when you load the mud tray add a little bit of water, mix it in lather rinse repeat until its creamy but not much thinner than when you dug it out of the mud box. youll know you got it right when you load a blade and the mud stays smooth and piled up, if its too dry itll break and crumble along the sides if its too thin it wont form a smooth pile on the blade itll flow off. wear clothes you do not mind never getting clean again put down a canvas drop cloth, plastic will fail do not trust it. wear shoes that can be taken off easily so when you leave the area covering by the drop cloth you can leave the shoes there and avoid tracking mud you will drop all over the house wear a bandana that completely covers your hair. trying to get dry mud you didnt realize was in your hair out is NOT FUN use regular yellow joint tape for inside corners, staple it up as high as you can and mud almost up to it before pulling the staple and finishing it. do not leave it to dry and come back the next day to deal with it, doing that will leave a lump you will have to remove before finishing. a 2 inch spatula blade is for working very tight areas and filling in small divots, you can get by with a 6inch and 12 inch blade but if you want to add a bit of a step you can use a 4inch blade to load a seam joint before putting the tape up, the 6inch blade will work fine for dragging the excess mud off and setting the tape. let the 1st application dry completely before doing the second pass and float pass you will get mud all over you, you will wonder how you got mud in your hair when you were only working on the walls and lower joints butt joints, areas where cut ends meet up will require extra work to smooth out. expect to float 16 inches out from butt joints to fade them in outside corners are best done with metal corner strips that come pretaped they will give you beautiful corners and hide those wavy cuts unless you put the cut to an inside corner and the seam joint to the outside, in which case still use the metal corner fitting it is always best to use a rigid corner material on an outside corner because the moisture in the joint compound aka mud will make getting a clean corner on the 'will be damp for days' cut drywall corner is _very_ time consuming and pros usually just rip out the dry wall and redo it seam corner out if theyre allowed because of how much effort is required to make a damp wavy edge into a nice clean corner regulations for float in commercial here in the states varies but is usually 24inches which makes it look like you are essentially plastering the wall and it isnt necessary. a good float can be done at 12 inches let the float coat dry completely then use a damp sponge to wipe off any ridges and make the float smooth as glass when taping start from a corner and work all the way across, working from the corners to the center will leave bumps and working from the center to the corners will waste lots of material trying to get it right before picking up a single mud tool or scrap of tape make absolutely sure all screws or nail heads are counter sunk, for screws the 2inch blade is ideal for mudding in the divots nails tend to require a 3 or 4 inch blade because to set then below flush you have to leave a hammer head divot which is often nearly an inch across and a 2inch blade will leave an odd depression/require more effort than necessary for seam joints on the walls the sticky mesh tape is perfect, you can put it directly in place, no mud required to hold it in place though a staple on 1 end will keep you from pulling it loose as you work just remember to remove the staple. i know this tip sounds like im repeating it a lot but unless you are fine with frustration every few minutes take it to heart but dont forget to remove them. MOST IMPORTANT MUD TIP do everything you can to avoid dry mud chips from the bag the mud came in from dropping into the mud your using, even a small chip will leave gouges and tracks that will frustrate you to no end. the best way toi avoid the problem for a short term at least is to move the mud from the bag its sealed in in the box to a bucket with a good lid. to do so do not untie the bag, lift it out entirely and while the strong person holds it over the bucket the person good at directing things rips a hole in the bottom and squeezes the mud into the bucket. when removing mud from the bucket avoid smearing mud up the inside of the bucket, it will dry and crumble and make everything else much much more frustrating after every full tray has been mostly used, i say mostly because by the time you get to the last dregs the mud has dried out considerably and there will be chunks of assorted detritus mixed in, wash out the tray, clean the blades, do not half ass it orr you will be further frustrated. if you take the time to watch some vids on the tapping and floating part and get an idea of how to do the main work you only need to remember that as long as you dont leave any major gouges or ridges you will not have to sand at all, a damp sponge will let you get rid of small ridges and smooth out the joint to a near polished state ... as long as you dont over do it corners are the mudmans bane if said mudder is inexperienced. inside corners are hardest because you are working 2 sides towards the center. use some scrap drywall to experiment with butt joints, seam joints and inside corners until you have an idea of what to do. its a time killer but for beginners that practice can mean the difference between a nice finish and a bunch of 'why did you punch the wall now we have to patch _that_ too!?'
Wheres the dog? Did i ask to soon or miss his appearance?
Thank goodness for some comic relief after getting a call from my daughter that her car had been broken into overnight!  😩
I'm still sick with covid and don't really feel up to watching or commenting on videos. But it's Eamon and Bec. And btw it feels like the flu so if Eamon was feeling like that maybe...
bec! your winter outfits are killer?! I end up looking like a burrito
That's funny you faced time Trent i just watched  the Trent and Allie  vid on plumbing
As a Northern Minnesotan, I will say that winter sunbathing is the best feeling ☀️❄️
Bec's space buns during the drywall are too cute! Y'all make Sundays so much better!
Yay  .... oh Man flew  so bad ... We need help :)
I always look forward to y’all’s video every Sunday !! I love y’all
I can't wait to see this completed! Love watching the process
Sunday morning routine: make some chai, snuggle on the couch, watch Eamon and Bec! I'm always entertained and often inspired. I'm a former omnivore, current pescatarian, headed in the vegan direction. You make it look simple and natural and that's inspiring! Xoxo
I'm so early on this video!! Man my partner and i would love that van. Its such a dream.  I'm also in Ontario! My uncle has a cottage up by south river :)
Who would’ve thought a video on drywalling could be entertaining 🤣...
love love love every video💖💖💖
BRO those sunnies are mint.
Oh no even Trent said not to???
Looking so much better already !
When can I come stay with you guys?! I graduate high school this year and it would be my dyinnggg wish to come stay with you before I get shipped off to college!! You guys are my daily inspiration and motivation to be happy in life❤️
Oh man i wish i could win that van..  😭😭😭 my life would be changed forever
Yay!
yayyy we are sooo excited to listen to the podcast! Loved listening to the first season!
OMG-My daughter and I LOVED the Gilmore Girls! Bond bond bonded over that show and identified with those characters so much.
So excited for the podcast! Catching up on the backlog now! What's y'all's timeline for finishing the cabin reno?
IM SO EARLY YAY
Love spending my Sunday mornings with you guys ❤️
Sleepy Hollow is a jail in PEI lol
🖤
HI GUYS!  Came over from Instagram to just say have a great day and keep Mossa.  ❤️
By far the best part of my week❤️
Yay! You guys brighten my day!
I would have insulated behind all of the ceilings and dry wall for heat retention and sound reduction. Why are you chosing to skip on this, just wondering?  I would also replace the existing 'brown' wall in the guest bedroom as it looks old and a bit warped which will get worse with time. For the sake of a few sheets of dry wall, I think you should replace it and stick in some insulation between the two bedrooms or your guests might hear you ?  I'm an architectural technician so do know what I'm talking about, but feel free to ignore.  Dry wall fixing is doable and you ve done a great job, but taping and 'mudding' or 'plaster skimming' as we call it here in the UK is a skilled job for professionals IMO, but knowing you guys, you will pull it off.
YESSS!! I WAS JUST THINKING ABOUT THE PODCAST THIS PAST WEEK AND I WANTED U GUYS TO BRING IT BACK 🤩🤩
Thank you Eamon and Bec for bringing us so much joy with your videos!  I introduced my husband to your channel and videos and he's so cute, on Sundays he always asks, "What are our Canadian friends up to this week."  lol.
Oh  yay!! So looking forward to the new season of podcasts!! Now we get to see you Sunday and hear you Monday haha
Eamon, those glasses ARE THE BOMB!  But seriously, take care of your back ~ give it some love
Ahhh love your videos! 😍
Watching this in my Sunday sweatshirt happy Sunday everyone!!!!
My heart is so happy seeing that this pup gets a second chance!!!
Suntanning in the snow 😂😂
if I won the van, I could begin my dream of traveling the country with my environmental science degree i receive in less than one year! I've been in school for 3 years now and can't wait to go into some sort of conservation work when I'm done! That cool-ass van would be a dream come true!!!!!!!
0:50 the most Canadian thing we have seen 😂
I get up early on Sundays just to watch these videos. Yes!!! I am SO SO excited about the podcast is coming back!!!
seriously i need to know if anyone else binge watches eamon & bec 😂😂 i’ve gone back to watch sooo many of your old travel vlogs over the past 2 weeks ♥️♥️ much love from toronto
Hiiiii my favorite couple!
I miss the man bun!!!
Thank you for your weekly uploads. I can’t see my partner at the moment because we live apart and we are in lockdown again 💔 but we call and watch your video together on a Sunday evening which is such a lovely way to end the week
Hello! I can not wait for the weekly uploads. I have been following along on Instagram, I love Mossa! I know he may not be in this vlog, but I hope he is doing well with you guys. I am sure he will find a loving home. I can not wait to start up your podcast again, it definitely gives me something to look forward to. I hope everything stays going well, and that the winter and lockdown are not too harsh on you guys. Thank you for bringing a smile to my face and brightening my day.
Got my chai and I’m snuggled in to watch my favs❣️
I can’t believe it’s already been a week! I can’t wait to see Mossa!!!
Hey y'all!!
Sleepy Hollow made me giggle, you guys are so cute
Youtube is broken again 0 views and 141 likes 27 likes
Lol, was laughing so hard even Trent's like taping and mudding...I think I get someone else to do that. Mudding and taping is not fun at all really messy and sucks if your a novice  remodeled some of my house and had some drywall replaced or repaired. Good luck
So excited for the Reroot reboot!!! Also, love Eamon's glasses!
If it's not something dangerous I see no problem with doing it yourself, always love a good challenge!
Awesome to hear from you guys again!!! You are such an inspiration. Random question do you guys think you will ever go back to van life or is it over 😂
Yay new vlog! Sunday is complete 🥰
I love how 6 people told you not to do dry wall, then Lee swoops in and says "if anyone can do it, it's you guys!". Love her energy, and your relationship is so sweet! Great video as always :)
