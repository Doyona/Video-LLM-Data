Had to come back after SmackDown!
It’s happening again tonight
An absolute shame aew wasted Malachi Blacc smfh
My favourite  Black only one
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👌 good 👍
black mass is very Dangerous man..
So beautiful cody Rhodes ❤❤❤❤❤❤
Blacks is the best
This guy is very dangerous ( Malakai),he wins all most every match
Why is Cody Rhodes weak in AEW?
0:31
I temember this like it was yesterday. Black beat obe of the biggest stars in the company like it was nothing. Awesome moment 🤯👍
Aleister  black is my favourite guy to me his the goat i love his fights and performance in the ring and outside 👌❤🙏
Malakai Black is Sports Entertained.
Malachi has broken the American nightmare
Malachi black broke Cody
Imagine if this exact outcome happens AGAIN in April...! 👀
I will never get tired of seeing Cody sell that Black Mass kick.
Black is dangerous
My god this match was great
Cody 😂😂🤣🤣💩  Aleister black 🗿💀☠️
ब्लैक और खड़ी की फाइट यूनिवर्सल चैंपियन कराई जाए ब्लैकजीतेगा😂
Cody tu bache ki tara har gaya😅😅
The way cody jumps not from the kick but on his own 3:04 just funny😂
No codey no 😂😂❤
"dutch style of muay thai" ???😂
You were suppose to destroy bad booking, not become the very thing you swore to destroy...
What a great match! Too bad AEW sucks now
What is his name? malakai or aleister?
good allister black.😮 cody😂😂😂
4:40 “That won’t get it.”  *Malakai wins*  *”MAH GAWD!!!!”* 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I love the way Cody threw himself to the table
They did nothing with this momentum and win. Everyone who Cody feuded with was just built up to lose to him in the long run.
Malakai black is like a very dangerous person in the aew dynamite but I think Cody could handle and take malakai down and destroy him as well so good luck to Cody and please win ok !!
This guy need more adjustment
Black mass part 2
aew treated cody bad.
Tony didn't capitalize on Blacl he should have beat orange cassidy for the international title
Pisses me off they never capitalised on this win for Malakai by giving him some sort of title run.
That ws huge. Fight reigns pls
That is a huge very huge win. Cody rhodes. Fight roman pls
Black Mass part 1🥊🤼‍♂️
Hello
That roundhouse will get ya every time
❤
Break is arm
Malakai should become AEW champion
This is the start of Cody getting booed because Malakai was over as hell when he debuted
The real god mode 🔥🫡
Malakai Black!!!! He's awesome!!!!
Just do this when he comes back please!!!! This man is a god
And now we're back at this over a year later. Damn. How badly this great momentum was lost. How badly this aged, after Cody's efforts and Malakai's vision.
Coulda had a main eventer, coulda saved yourself from the decline, coulda gone into fall 2022 looking strong instead of looking shit. What a shame. Can't wait to see Tom booked under Paul, the one guy that treated him decent.
Crazy to go from this 10/10 debut to today's current events 😕
Number one Alister black
Omg the announcers don't know SHYT about martial arts there's no such thing as Dutch Style Muay Thai Muay Thai Is from Thailand....... Malakai isn't a Muay Thai Practioner he's a Kickboxer a Dutch Style KickBoxer they are not the same styles ......
Rewatching this and damn JR was bad calling the finish he sold the kick after Black got the pin lol
Yesterday, today and tomorrow... Malakau number 1.
Legend has it that Cody is still asleep to this day.
I hope one day to see Sting - darby allin - malakai black doing a stable 🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻
That Step Pin The Hardest Pin Ever by far
Goddamn Malakai is one of the greatest things going in wrestling right now.
@4:40 when the baddassness starts
I love malakai black❤
Cody how can u be champion when u get not beat this guy with ease.
Aliester vs brock.,.last man standing😎😎😎😎😎🙂
<----- Still in Shock
MY GOD IN HEAVEN. haha man Jim Ross is the best.
Wow what a black mass he hit Cody rhodes
I am here just because of Alistar Black 🖤
Anyone else watching this after Maliki blacks first loss
Cody Rhodes is great,
Black
AEW now has it’s Undertaker?
That won’t get it.. 1 2 3 MY GOD! WHAT DID WE JUST SEE!! Lmao!!! Love Jim Ross
My God...JR stinks on kce!
Ok first off the table spot was off on timing and the finish you can see the leg slap on the inside thigh . This is embarrassing 😂😂😂😂😂 got to love fake wrestling
weirdest "omg!" ive ever heard JR say haha 3:05
3:05 Jim Ross: "Oh my God! Oh my God!" I love the way he says that hahaha.
4:25
just watch the match, why the fans are booing cody and cheering for malakai?
Signing JR was the best thing AEW ever done. ❤️
when cody goes through the table and jr says “oh my god, oh my god!” the execution is just perfect. so good.
Cody gets squashed but then he tells Lee Johnson and Dustin to have a competitive match where Malakai has to cheat.
I love that neither man looked pathetic.  Even getting his ass handed to him, Cody didn't look bad.  That's showmanship and talent.
Malakai Black getting a Jake the Snake allusion from JR?  Interesting... since AEW likes factions/stables... perhaps a new Legion of Doom?  Black, Archer, and a recently recruited Windam Rotunda being the 3 piece to start it? Mebbe. Dunno. Just musing
The Chris Jericho taunt pin worked? Wow! 😳
ALISTER BLACK MESAGGE TRILPLE H TO CODY NEXT COME SUPER MECTH TRIPLE H VS CODY ;)
Allister Black is doing something somewhat worthwhile in WCW 2.0
@ 00:11..That's what she said!! 😂😂😂😂
This guy back there had the potential to conquer any title... But they never used him the way he should have been.
Rematch @AEW
The hush of aew
Damn nice match and straight to the point. Cody sold him as a badass.
Alistair Black rocks over Cody Rhodes
Aliester black and malakai black are tge same person?
We need to see Malakai black vs Pac
This guy is sauron in aew
Why didn't the nightmare family help Cody?
Yeah that table wasn't placed there just for that spot was it.  At least don't make it obvious
Is it just me or doesn't Malakai Black looks like eivor from AC Valhalla?
in 6 months - 1 year NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO RUSH Malakai vs Punk
Wrestle everybody no exceptions just great matches no ego's just Talent. Keep doing what u doing Malakai Black.
I wish he pinned people like this every week. That's so great, but he hasn't done it since. It puts over his finisher as such a death blow that he doesn't even need to properly cover them, plus it's rubbing salt in the wound of the person who loses.
Bro wtf that jump was so delayed he leap off the turnbuckle so lame
Lol jump  ......3rd class action
Cody is alive
🌅 ବଢ଼ିଆ ମଜା ମାନେ ଶ‌ଇ ମାଡ଼ 🌹
Black vs Punk!
Black Butler does fane
Malakai Black Vs Cm Punk , book it khan
Anyone else want a Jon Moxley vs. Malaki Black, lights out match?!
Cody Rhodes good fighter but black is fabulous
Good
3:11 look at the bruises on cody's back... sometimes we forget how much pain these guys endure, thank you really
At least the camera man got Black's good side.
That guy is athletic as hell.
JR is THE GOAT
Yess good to see his talent being appreciated here
"It is big. It feels big."  Thats what she said.
all I can say for real real. Dusty would be so proud of his boy.
Announcers calling the holds.  A ref that matters, you can believe they're trying to enforce rules.  A crowd who recognizes and respects the craft.  THANK YOU AEW for PROFFESIONAL WRESTLING!
Cody doesnt know thats Alister Black
This match says it all - This is AEW's Undertaker! Scratch that, this is no undertaker, this is MALAKAI BACK!
Everything looked awsome except for that jump on the table😂
10 count took a whole minute long
Seth rollin's impact  carried by malakai black
If Malakai gets squashed when Cody comes back, we riot.
Malakai Black  killed  cody that night  and  tonight  he will eat Brock Anderson alive
Cody is getting fatter day by day
Cody botch with the table…too late!
I would have thought he would use the name Tommy End again, just sounds cooler imo
Black vs punk
Hola
Are now has two people who like to sit crossed leg in the middle of the ring.
Cody appears to have learned the lesson Jeff Jarrett never did.  Just because you're part of the ownership doesn't mean you have to continually book yourself up carry the strap
I'm waiting for that moment when CM punk trash talk then Malakai black apper and kick him out of no where.😂
How did JR end up here
CM. PUCK!  CMPUCK ! CM. PUCK!!!
Black super kick awsome foot
외국인이 저래 편하게 양반다리 하는거 보니 개웃기네ㅋㅋ
Cody Rhodes has to be the ultimate punching bag. Azz whopping after azz whopping.
Don't forget, Black is an experienced MMA artist. It shows too. Love watching his style.
Cody are you still going to wrestle though? It's only one match. You've got more left in the tank.
Black mass
Never really cared for wrestling anymore like I used to back In the day and my friend like check out malakai black because I train muay thai and I love this guy 😂
Lol Cody threw himself through the table 🤣
Jr really ruined this match
One of these guys is an overrated loser with bad tattoos…the other is Malakai Black.
Is he Alastair black🤔🤔
Jesus Christ that knee strike bro fire
From aleister black to Malachi black
As usual Cody crying after losing one match with new opponent
God, I fucking love this company. Thank you for making it ok to be a wrestling fan again, and to actually *gasp* base the company around putting out a product those fans want to see!
This is lame.
Yeah I didn’t expect him to lose
Any martial artist would destroy A professional wrestler
The moves in professional wrestling is so fucking stupid
This guy is it. This is your next Undertaker.
Black Mass has to be one of the best looking finishers ever, to be able to perfect that and barely had a legit injury takes talent
Wow Cody could you have dived to go through the table any more dramatically
Alester black number one
Black. Omega. Book it
I like this new aggressive side of black. His going to be a champion someday
Black WILL BE CHAMPION OF AEW. HE WILL. OMEGA IS NICE BUT BLACK IS ON A WHOLE DIFFERENT LEVEL. UNDERTAKER LIKE.
Aew champion for Lakai black
Cody will book himself to get his win back at the PPV I'd imagine 😔
Wow black mass
Hahahahaha, that fake jump into the table
Why I need to do to get a contract I’m not getting younger I miss the gold I miss the title I want my Waze I miss tried changing the best with the company has to offer If not just come in fights it’s about time I’ll go on a rampage
When dat guy went to aew
Definitely a must see
Nice delay between the kick and jumping off the turnbuckle 🤣😂🤣
Stardust and black we miss you 🥺
Safe to say that everyone in the company should be used to being around a demonic dark presence like Malakai
Respect to Cody for doing the job to Black. I respect Cody a hell of a lot more now.
What a acting by Cody 😀😀😀👎👎👎
Malakai Black dominated Cody. Kenny Omega....Your time is coming
Alaster black is in aew now
🇳🇵👍🤩🤩🤩🤩
He should wear black tight. That would be cooler imo than that black muaithai short, unless he start working out buffing his tight and leg
It's so sad to see black here in AEW
Hang about… an actual wrestling match and not just the Young Bucks doing fucking flips for 30 straight seconds? I can dig this!
Look at Cody's jump on Table @ 3:04, Totally Fake (I mean bad acting)
Cody sold like a champ, absolutely fantastic match. This is how you use TALENT.
Malakai Black is the best
🔥🔥🔥🔥
this is by far my favorite "modern" pro-wrestling match that I have seen in a very long time. it looked excellent, everything was crisp, no goofiness, had a big time feel and realism to it. didn't care that much for the table spot but it did work to a lesser degree. nonetheless, i really hope this is the direction that pro-wrestling can move towards. stuff like this makes me a big time fan of pro-wrestling. maybe it was short but i believed it.
now this is pro wrestling
Its an absolute shame Cody doesn't have his heart in wrestling for AEW he seems to be the only one that knows how to actually book stuff while bridging the AEW fans and real wrestling fans
absolute STAR if Tony only knew how to book people over
What did we just see?????????    ehhhh    The same thing we saw last time he had to go do the other job he really wants.....
Wow, talk about amazing talent. And to think he was getting buried by Rollins just a year ago.
5mnts match 😜🤣🤣🤣🤣
Cody gets kicked on turnbuckle.Cody also decides to throw himself through table! 😅😂🤣
Jr missing the mark on a finisher then having to play it off
We have to rename the finishing move of Black from "Black mass" to "Black out".
Yes I think I'll be watching AEW and Wrestling a bit more now some stuff is improving
I always though AEW was terrible until I got lost in their ig tv
Malakai black is awesome
Cody in SmackDown you are Campion
3:03 that,was like Batista selling
Fun fact: Malakai also has a neck tattoo
Ok hear me out... Malakai black as baldur
Buena lucha...
The fact that Cody tries to surprise Malakai Black with the Cross Rhodes at 2:45 baffles me. He's so over-confident that even when he's clearly losing thinks he can throw his finisher out of nowhere
Now we just need Andrade to look this good
GUY COULDNT HARDLY BEAT ANYBODY BUT CAN ON AEW
Alester black 😍❤❤
Goodnight Irene
I like alester black
Malakai black? Alister black?
Dam a good match 👏,  the crowd is interested in it, I'm actually impressed.
Lucha Libre a las Escuela Clásica Mexicana ❤️
Victory for Prince Zuko
It feels big it is big. Thats what she said
Alastair Black
AEW should hire Mauro Ranallo
Jim Ross makes it so epic
And that match did more for black than his entire main roster run
Black is going to be hard to boo right now
Pedro
Malakai Dakobla"  :)  so funY"..in WWI not more funny
Muay Thai is not known for kicking. Who's announcing this b.s. It's known for Elbows, knee's, and element of surprise.
I just love this wrestling
The way Cody Rhodes just put Black over massively. That's what I take from this.
What happened to his eyes
Jimmy Ross’ skepticism of the pin made it 100x better
Alister black  in Aew🤔
I love the black mass 🔥
Saw this on TV I can't believe he is in AEW.
Cody needs to learn how to sell a move properly, he literally threw himself on the table
Looks so fake
Alister black so dangerous 🔥
Malakai doesn't have a good ring to it like alister black
He is probably the best in the world at the moment. Best ive seen in while anyway.
Aleister black
He whooped his ass
Black is my favorate. Black mass cick.
This is alliester black
Haven't watched rasslin in years (WCW and Ruthless Aggression era) but this Malakai Black is pretty legit. Might have to give AEW a shot.
ISN'T HE ALIESTER BLACK???
"When they read u the script and tell u ur gonna win the fight"
He looks exactly like Aleister Black ⚫ 🤔
🗑
Now dats the push malakai needed
ʙʟᴀᴄᴋ ᴍᴀꜱꜱ🎳
I hope they protect finishers in AEW. Especially that kick.
He did exactly what was writing in the script! Oh my God! Amazing!!!! Lol dumb
Cody jumped into that table.  Weak sauce.  Gotta make it look better.
Dutch Muay Thai GTFO with that nonsense
Ima go get a word from Cody ima go get him up  *Slams headset on desk*  😂😂😂
Jim Ross can't do this anymore.. he sounds too artificial, they need someone new for this.
How to get a finishing move over. Step 1. Have it finish a match. Step 2. Have it keep finishing matches.
God, this is what i wanted to see
Not a big fan of the way AEW refs seem to work. No warning for the eye gouge after he saw it. I saw a tag match earlier today where the ref may no effort to control things when the wrong men were in the ring, just watching them double team. I had hoped they would be tighter and cleaner.
Ok now this is quality. I only watch ufc now but 😲.
😆😆...  This is so trash it's hilarious!! Fake shit
Legend says Cody still hasn’t gotten up from that kicking. Some say he never will.
This is exquisite. This two guys fits so perfectly in the ring together.
Cody is so boring mate, there I said It.
Wtf was this is this what you aew marks creamed your pants over this was absolutely terrible debut and if it were any other company yall be screaming how lame it was and wasted his talents smh
Malakai Black is so Great
His finisher is legendary ❤🔥
Mantap,,
Black mask and sleep
Malakai black!! Now wait a minute🤔🤔...I think I have seen him somewhere
0:25...they headbutted each other pretty hard there...suprise no one got cut open by that😳
good sut
4:28  Kick of the decade 😶
Malakas
🔥
🔥
4:32 a huge right hand? Wtf is this clown still doing at commentary?
Aleister plz wear the trunks these mini shorts are ugly
I did it wrong, to get someone over u have to lose in 2 mins in your first match
Amazing wrestling 🤼‍♀️ match.
Cody... he a company man.. he is a smart man
Malakai black next champion
Fake fighting krte hai khud hi girte hai
Future champion black 😈
This is how you make a new star in professional wrestling. Other organizations would do well to take note.
Alister black become malakai black if he go impact will he become monster black ?😂
Black rocks 🤘🤘
Ese ; era antes Alister Black ! ; .
Im an even bigger Malakai Black fan now. His in match style is so smooth and believable.
I actually liked an AEW match.
1m🤙🖤
Hey! Para todos los fans del PRO WRESTLING hispanohablantes! Somos El Tag Team y queremos hablarles sobre éste arte que tanto nos apasiona. Escuchen nuestro debut!
La patada de alester blac boltea mascaras
If bray Wyatt comes and adds to this I’ll have no choice but to watch
Black definitely deserves to be a world champion! Been a fan since his Tommy End days
FUNNY THIS GUY BLACK COULDNT BEAT NOBODY ON RAW BUT DOES ON HERE WEAK WRESTLERS
Nice one there, Cody. Good job being a leader by giving this man that win like that.
Máquina de sexo eu canto igual animal a chatuba de mesquita do bonde sexo oral
04:38 🔥🔥🔥
3 days and 1m view wow
Everything he touches is gold. He just needs some sick looking Muay Thai shorts with his name written in Black Metal font.
Wow🤟
For those of us who remember Tommy End with a ponytail and board shorts, the black muay thai shorts are a welcome throwback.
Matthew is here
Who set the table ? at right point
Are video game
We want AEW in india ❤️❤️❤️
listen 3:04
More matches like this please. The flips are cute, but it's not 2005 anymore.
He kinda looks like aleister black
Alistair Black rocks over Cody Rhodes
And that's how you establish dominance and a super star in one night. Who ever booked this major props and respect to Cody.. ladies and gentlemen  we have a new player in AEW
4:49 I don’t know why but I love this fist bump in the upper right corner. These guys don’t know each other but what they saw was so cool that they both wanted a fist bump and found it right next to each other
Imagine if Braun strowman actually showed up in aew. He'd eat these guys alive. Black is supposed to be this dominant force and he's like 5'8
Only thing they can improve is Black's attire
get rekt Cody
That was a solid match, now build up Malakai Black and put a Hardcore Strap on him (all black, black titanium!) 🤘🏻
👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎
🔥
🔥
Awesome Debut
zzzzzzzzzzzzzz...
Malakai Black is Great he must Stay Undefeated
The Cody hate bothers me, dudes been spending the last year putting over a bunch of talent when he doesn’t have too
I love Malakai Black more than Aleister Black.
Alister black😥💔
Malakai Back is the GOAT
This is EXACTLY why Cody wins WAYYY more than he loses. Because, the people who beat him INSTANTLY become stars as a result.  MJF Brodie Lee Darby Allin Malakai Black  It's booking 101
anyone know what Black mouths at the end? seems something like "thats how it's done around here" but it doesnt all match up.
I wanna see either Pac v Black... Or Pac & Black on a team
Blackmass
This is finally the right way to book a wrestler, Malakai Black is a god damn star and deserves this fresh new step in his career and the new entrance song is absolutely awesome, cant wait to see whats instore for AEWs future
4:50 Any lip readers out there? "Thats how this was suppose to go" ? best I got
The good folks at AEW made this man a star in 5 minutes.   And just wait until he has to actually GO with somebody…and wait for how much it’s going to mean for whoever beats him.  No time soon of course..
Is that star dust?? The blond guy
Alester  black
Very interesting name there…
Hate to be this guy but that table spot would’ve been way cooler if he didn’t slap his fucking thigh…it draws my attention away cause that’s all I see lmfao
That's some trash gear. Js
Black squeezing the kneecap in that Boston crab was a great little detail in attacking Cody's leg. 👌
I kinda liked Aleister Black as a charcater better but i love him in AEW
Malakai Black ❤️
Cody is now a jobber??
It took five minutes to make Black look like a killer and a mega star. Incredible.
Dream match: Malakai black vs the demon Finn balor or the fiend….book it and take my money!
Dude Cody is the most overrated wrestler in history! Dude even got a neck tattoo thinking he’s the shit 😂 dudes been a joke his whole life
Their competition wasted a Malakai vs. Fiend feud.  They are the modern day Jake the Snake and Mankind!
I can’t wait for Bryan, especially cm punk and hopefully bray to show up as well to wrestle a lot of talented and known stars like them both, this is a way for Cody to take his time off a bit to spend it with his fam
I cant get behind blacks dark/ocult char when he is wear shortie shorts.
So I dont have cable... does AEW do streaming? Just see highlights :(
Welcome Mr. Black
That guy looks a lot like Alistair black
Compare this to Killer Kross's debut on Raw vs Jeff Hardy
Malakai ? wtf
What you just saw J.R is the Dutch Destroyer taking over AEW in his own chilling way. As the saying goes..." you're not Dutch, you're not much", and he exemplifies it, darkness has come to Khan town.
clowns show xddd
Weird angle their at the end of dynamite. Didnt make sense. But thats professional wrestling
Cody Also..Young❤️👍🏻
Black is Back!👏👏👏
Ohhhhh, so that's how you get one guy over (black) and build up a babyface (cody).  Cody is awesome.
I love Malakai Black
Malakai Black 🖤
Imagine just telling anyone at the start of May or June that in 2-3 months a Dynamite main event would be Alister Black vs Cody Rhodes, truly unexpected
Malakai black is the best of AEW 🤩🤩🤩
Men what happend to Aleister Black😳
Better than that Monday night and Friday night garbage 3:05
Black is Bangkok ready
That's how you book this guy!
Most of WWE's washed up former employees end up at AEW.
Gil180 BX 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼🇵🇷👍🏼🇵🇷
What did we see? Script well played
Dónde están los latinos ? 😁
Black whipped his ass !!!!!!!
اليستر بلاك✔ ملكاي بلاك❌
His build reminds me of CM Punk, and his kicks and knee/leg pads.
3:03 😂😂 clear acting
Cody is the shit....what he does business wise is glorious
This is awesome!!
That was not a knee bar more like trying an ankle lock .. wtf 😬  When someone gets kicked they generally fall forward and his muay  Thai is shit
Who falls back like that just let’s go of the rope . Yea ok mate ! 😂
That table bump was trash why not just have the table closer so it's not so obvious you just jumped on your own through it
Aleister's Black Mass will become the most beautiful move in wrestling entertainment
This was an awesome match! Black is finally showcasing what he´s all about, I see big things for him in AEW.
Malakai's tattoos bring all the boys to the yard, damn Cody their better than yours.
Dad bod at its best….
Black's attire is so bad. AEW lacks charisma rn if you ask me.
Cody the great amature wrestler lmao
JR: „Nah that won’t do it“  Beautiful 🤣
Waiting for cm punk debut
I love this guy!  Not only can he wrestle very well, he's a great talker, but what I like the most is he uses one of my fighting styles!  I've never seen it before in wrestling and it makes him unique.
3:06 oh my caaw oh my caaw
Codie rhodes is the only thing worth watching on aew
Vince ruined this guy, AEW will make him a star
3:04 man wth 😭
First aleister black  Now malakai black
Trying find this on TV network I can watch it besides Hulu
black  champion material
Sad Acts wearing the masks
Now I know where's aleister black now..
Looks like AEW has finally found their top heel!!! Pretty soon the whole wrestling world is gonna chant Roman who?
They need new commentators or they need to get out jim Ross ear or something
Jim Ross went from no chance to by gawddd!!!!!!!!
Malakai black is a draw already nearly 1 million viewers . Numbers don't lie
Still better than 3Hrs of Raw
Malakai Black is Amazing
Love the reaction of the fans..  Like paid actors 😑
Why is Black wrestling in women’s pajama bottoms? 🤷
3:03 wtf 🤣🤣🤣
Black is the best in The World !!!
Black with the kicks are something crazy
Cody for the AEW World Championship!!
Cody putting over new stars is amazing and meanwhile we have Omega and Young Bucks who are actually Overrated and ppl still hate and call Cody overrated. Please make Omega lose the belt to Christian and Young bucks to Eddie Kingston and Moxley. Massive respect and love for Cody.
This was trash
In Which channel in tatasky this show telecast?
Love to see where Tommy End is now. After I saw him first time live @ wXw back in the day, iam a huge fan
And so much of his offense he didn't show.  Basically the opposite of Andrades  debut match.
The kick to the head and the fall to the table I'd give that a 4/10 sorry but it wasn't that fluid
I miss wcw
Awesome moment from JR here lol
That kick was so on the button, he hit the jaw and nothing else
3:03 What a sell
Worthy to be champion of this company
Scripted 😂
This vince... is what you're missing
aleister black is still the better name to me
Cody Rous xd
Every single move looked fake...
Ahh yes finally black mass...
thank for Kassandra , the Eagle Bearer , now i think his name is Maláka :(
Interesting Match :)! I love the way you fight, both :)
Loved that table spot! No one expected it and just added so much more to the already awesome match!
Alester black still good
The black House
Aew smackdown is the best
Alister black 🔥
Malakai Black looks incredible and Cody sold that finisher beautifully. Massive props to both guys
Cody just literally threw himself off the ropes to hit the table😂😂🤝
Facts
He needs to loose the boxing trunks lol go back to wrestling trunks
The next Undertaker!
You  never see black coming win he strikes and win he hit you don't no what happened till it's over
4:28 black mass
Man that sell on that kick before Cody leaped backwards for that table was terrible 😂
I see AEW vid. I decide to watch. Match is iffy at first since I cannot understand what anyone's plan is at first. Malakai sinks in an awful looking single crab, but I understand the plan. Then Cody, who has a battered leg, decides his best course of action is to climb the corner post, whereupon his opponent kicks him and he laughably flings himself into the announce table for no apparent reason.  This right here? This is why you are stagnating, AEW. Just because we all know it's a work does not mean you can disregard verisimilitude.
Alister Black is Great wrestler love you from Pakistan
Black has the ugliest inting wrestling attire
aleister still using the black mass nice.
I really love Black 🖤
that table spot was faker than the marko pizzeria uno elimination spot
Fake
White guys in aew only wanna put over other white guys
AEW is just for kid
I feel like JR is just commentating to be a commentator. It's like he doesnt care, his reaction at the end when malaki won was like delayed, and should've been said the moment malaki hit the kick. Like,   (Black mass connects)  OH MY GOD, CODY'S JAW JUST GOT TWISTED SIDEWAYS!   (When malaki wins)  Oh and some added disrespect for the pin. malaki did exactly as he said he would do, and cody was swept through by (Malaki's nickname if he has one I don't watch AEW)
i hope the trunks for black is temporary other than that everything is great !
I swear people would remember cody as a world's best in the future.
None of their matches ever have logic.
Cringe. YouTube keep this shit out my damn recommendations
Take a lesson here Vince.......what you should've been doing with Black.
Anybody Saw That Ric Flair Wooooooooooo?
I never was a fan of a strike as a finisher but this black mass is a beautiful move that needs to be sold accordingly. With MMA being prominent, a move like black mass needs that devastating finisher effect.
I swear, Black spins that kick even faster than before. His accuracy is on point.
Blacks over huge! Jr lol. "Attributes of jake Roberts." lol um no
This Whole Video Is Better Than Monday Night Raw😶
Jim Ross - “That won’t get it” Jim Ross - “MY GOD MY GOD”
WW Ed really fucked up not letting Black at least finish his new character, hes amazing.
Black's attire is based on darkness and cody's is based on light just like in Super Smash Bros. For Switch.
Black's talent is wasted with this bozo. We all know it's scripted, but it's not supposed to be obviously so. Rhodes needs work.
Seriously? Weakest kick to send someone through a table I've ever seen, not to mention the delayed reaction to the kick from Cody. I like Malakai Black, but sorry folks, that was weaksauce. Nice boxer shorts on Malakai as well.
Alastair Black...BLACK MASS🔥😃😃😍
Bruh Black dropped Rhodes like a bad habit, goodness.
oh men, I should watch more AEW. shame on me.
1:38 Did this idiot just say the Dutch style of Muay Thai?😂😂
Stardust gonna win this
Never been a big fan of Blacks but he is impressive.
Cody Rhodes has the dumbest tattoo of all time, and that's coming from someone with a couple of contenders himself
I don't get what's it about Bkack. His overall character and wrestling ain't all good.
Where did Black find those schmedium boy shorts?
Best ending to a match I've seen in a while.  I'm glad the fans are back.
I look forward to more of tommy end. Right now he is hitting second favourite. First is Moxley
That kick at 1:41... that kick tells you this guy's something special. Not many people can do that.
Was the "wooooooo" with the submission a spoiler to whats comming next *____*
Malakai Black is the perfect wrestler  I hope they don't let Punk and Bryan overshadow him  Give him big things
Cm punk return confirmed
This match was something else, was not expecting this. Brilliant!
Beat Cody with no effort at all 😂
whyd this virgin shit pop up in my recommended
Cody was out after the table shot for about 25 seconds 😂😂
Black is a really skilled guy man damn..just so fun to watch 🔥💯
Kudos to cody to put him over like this. Allowing black to put his foot on chest for 3 count to make black look more dominating.
3:04 same as with  mhurphy
3:04 wtf was that 🤣🤣
Ppl where so afraid of Cody burying Black while I've never seen cody bury any talent at all LOL
Black vs omega!!
Straight into title picture please.
Those jake the snake roundhouse kicks were lethal back in the day.
I like how no matter where he is wrestling he will have that black eye that Murphy gave him
If Cody wants to put you over, you're over yesterday.
I watch AEW for Malakai Black 🖤
Came for the kick, stayed for the pin.
Elister black have to return back in Raw/ smackdown... Pl come
To me, he's name isn gona go to be Malakai black, i'ts gona be Aleister black..
One of the dumbest table spots ever 😂
Cody loses again.... So the legacy is keeping wrestling alive and not about being on top.  The common man lives!!! Dustys legend continues!!
I can't believe I'm saying this but Excalibur got something wrong for once. He WAS correct about the use of the Dutch Muay Thai system but was wrong about the punching. The Dutch style is MORE known for punching than the Thai system because it focuses on foregoing use of elbow strikes and using punching combinations followed by kicks to the body... The thing that was happening on screen as he said that.
Is this "Malakai Black" the Undertakers former prodige, "The White Malakai"? From the ruthless agression era?
Black reminds of Baldur from God of War
🥱
Tbh I've been wanting Black vs Pac
Idiots saying that Cody never loses: The reason Cody needs to look strong is so when it’s time to put someone over, beating Cody means something. MJF, Darby Allin, Brodie Lee (Rest in Paradise), and now Malakai Black. All defeated Cody and are big deals now.
Malakai Black being the “Dark messenger” should use that role as the dark messenger of the exalted one sent to  reestablish the Dark Order in his own twisted interpretation.
Cody looks like new STING
We need more matches of this quality and tighten up on the rules!!
Cody just threw his self off the turnbuckle to the table
Spoiler alert: Cody immediately makes it about himself right after the fight is over, crying on mic, faking retirement for sympathy. Gets booed and HEY HEY GOODBYE chants, but AEW edits it out when they reupload the clip.
Not a fan of the goofy stuff in AEW..  But damn if they get guys like Punk Bryan Cole in the roster along with the current guys like Black miro Cody Omega Paige and others.. It'll surely give them a lot of credibility
I love how shocked JR was. Remember he never knows the end. Cause he doesn't want to know.
Hope to see malakai as world champ
You can hear JR say "that wont get him" when Black pins cody
This is how it's done.  AEW is on fire!  Black's entrance was so sick too.
Somewhere down the road and I'm not sure when, Malakai and Miro are going to meet
Thsts the power of Malakai black.
That Dutch style - Muy Thai.   Uh, what?
I want punk vs black
Black is such a overrated character.
BLACK destroy a CODY  Good for business
The way cody  fell of the turnbuckle on the table. He was buffering took him 2 seconds affer te kick😅😂😂
JR gets a lot of stick for his commentary as of recent but damn he was phenomenal here. You could feel that genuine reaction. Legendary
I dont consider this a squash match Malakai was definitely working him, but Cody definitely wasnt obliterated...and definitely last 5 minutes instead of the usual 2 to 1 minutes or under.
Easter eggs from The Elite segment on Dynamite last night:  Counting to 2012- CM Punk and Daniel Bryan feuded with each other that year.  Gallows wearing the Flair robe and his Woooo at the end - Obvious.  Young bucks Hawaiian shirt - Bray Wyatt.  Kenny Omega's shirt - Cookie Monster, CM Punk use to joke when wrestling on the indies that the CM in his name stood for was Cookie Monster.  At the end of the segment, The Elite kept saying - "What time is it", Punk would always say - "It's Clobbering Time".
Malakai 🖤🖤
Black still didn't recover from Seth Rollins's hurt! 😆 Still carrying it🤔
Cody staring at those bright lights...😮😮
Cody is gonna get his revenge
They have to make spots less obvious, like when Cody  is clearly pushing himself for the fall into the table.. Cody is a pro and making this mistake.
Jim Ross had an all-time call for the finish. 10/10 match.
This is how you debut a future 🌟 !
Now that was a wrestling match. Not a high spot fest that goes on way too long with zero psychology. What a debut match
thank you AEW because you made me love wrestling Again. ❤
Malakai Black ain't no joke that dude is lethal with his striking.
Best striker in wrestling history black is here
Malakai needs new gear. Those shorts ain’t it.
Black Mass v Beautiful Disaster
This wasn't just a very impactful debut, but it also left me wanna see more of Malakai in the ring!
Borred Black
He fucking KILLED him
Black and Raven would be a perfect tag team
Aleister is gone, Malakai has arrived.
props to aew for reviving black's powerful reputation
Dang alister black you still bad and mean
Its fake wrestling
Malakai Black vs Anthony Ogogo is more exciting , kicks vs punches .
Malakai Black fighting style is a type of pencak silat from Indonesia .
But in less than 5 minutes? Why?
Cody sold that like he was hit with a baseball bat
The fact is: this is what Tommy needs to show his abilities.
Malakai Black is a Star
Stardust vs aleister black
This is what you gave up Vinnie Mac
What an ass kicked… next AEW champion
Was that meant to be a squash match man basically became a jobber in that match😂😂
The most Dangerous. Malakai 🖤
Is this Alester black ????
This is how you build a superstar, not by putting it in meaningless tag teams
Gjb
Aleister black is overrated like aew
JR my gawd  what have we just seen Er we've just seen Cody put a big time piece of talent over clean or doing the honours
One small kick The guy flies a long way to land on the table 🤣🤣🤣
Ref could count to 50 for that pin
MALAKAI BRAVO
Malakai Black vs CM Punk please!
More matches should be this length. Fit a lot in a short period of time.
Hahaha Cody takes the kick, braces himself amd throws himself through a table. Jesus christ they need to stop with these ridiculous stunts they can't pull off.
The way the camera was set up you'd think Austin and Hogan were in the ring. This is a joke.
Wow
🔥
🔥
🔥
Aleister black
Looked really fake when Cody speank himself off the rope rope
Short but a great fast paced well timed match. It’s a good build for Black while Cody can legitimize time off while letting newcomers get over and grab some ring time. With all the comparisons to wcw this is an area where it seems Cody knows how to sacrifice where the big boys in wcw always kept themselves on top.
Cody got his ass kicked
JR saying "That won't get it" and then "MY GAWD!!!"
All the best best black for new journey
Isnt this Amazing YouTube brings me here after watching Charlotte Flair vs Nicki A.S.H
I give Cody credit for allowing these guys to get put over
Some part are face
When JR says this is a match you need to watch again. He wasn't wrong. For the first time in a long time, after watching a show, I had to go back and watch this match again. And again.
Awesome match. I just hope that if there is a rematch, Cody doesn’t win (ie Brody Lee) he doesn’t need it.
his black mass is no more smooth as 2 years ago
Omega vs black we want
2:18 he got till 5  Jr said he can't remember who said that well that was a good one Daniel Bryan will show up sooooooooooooooooooooooon.
I hope this rivalry develops after Cody finishes his game show tapings.
Is that’s how you make a crowd pop with a finish. You don’t need an afterbirth or masses of flips all the time
Tony, "I'm go see if I can get a word with Cody if he can get up".
ALEISTER BLACK TO MALAKAI BLACK
nice running shorts
Zalina vega will join aew soon tho
This dude kind kinda reminds me of Allister Black. Even does the thing where he sits in the middle of the ring
Superb acting 👏👏👏👏
This is so good! Theres a shift happening in wrestling folks! Right now! Its incredible and awesome time to be a wrestling fan right now after so many years of crap we are finally getting back to a good place again.💯🙏🏼
he needs a better ring gear though. What are those short!!!
It’s my first time properly watching AEW and I have to say, I enjoyed it.
3:00 Cody jump thru the table, nice storelyne for AEW.
waw! that kick had retarded effect Cody flied rigth to that table where a crew was expecting him haha
Oh.. alester black..... Looking like an idiot after becoming malakai black....
If anybody seen shooting style wrestling match Daniel Bryan Vs Tony end " malakai black" Daniel Bryan wins with low kick knock out "in real time black is not a tough guy"   But Daniel Bryan is a tough guy
Bro this match fucking sucked both no sold each other's moves the entire time
Aliester black name is better than malakai black
Cody is the fucking man. Put's over Black. Puts over Brodie. That boy knows "what's best for business"
Dream matches for Black:  1) Omega 2) Ambrose 3) PAC 4) Penta 5) Hangman
Holy crap !!! Malakai Black!!
No build up, No suspense, Black just barely shows up In Aew Week or two ago, Now He is put in with the Main Event Draw of Aew, and both have a Match on Free Tv, not even a pay per view, and , Cute how Cody threw himself on the time keeper's table like a good stunt man, with that weak fucking looking kick from black. This is why AEW is Total Amateur Hour.
This is good, the wrestling I once knew!
The atmosphere of his entrance give him a lot of presence, but it's his crisp, vicious offense that really makes him fun to watch. He's so precise and deliberate. I hope he's around for a long time.
Turned into a fight right quick 🔥.  Great performance by both men . Black   brings A fight with him . Sudden finish was lit 🔥.
TFW you put a FULL MATCH on your youtube but don't say it cuz it was so short. I love when Cody Rhodes just gets DEMOLISHED to make a guy.
That half crab was Sweet!!!
0:10 yeap that’s me
Oh my gad, OH MY GAD!!!
3:05 OH MY GAWD! OH MY GAWD!
Oh man malakai black should wrestle aliester black one day, dream match right there!
The best part of it all for me is when Malakai Black flashes the smile at the 5:09 mark, just for a split second, he knows this is what it's all about. Great job!
.this was a company respecting and believing a talent
Alister black is on fire 🔥🔥🔥❤️
Way to go Vince……
My  favourite black
Black is in the right company
OMG what are you doing aleister black?
Rayback rayback
Boss willing to get squashed for the company.
Cody Rhodes vs malakai black  My red rose fade to black whatttt!!!!!
Black mask didn't even connect properly
😃People in the crowed cheering for Cody in the beginning of the match and at the the they all switch up (WHAT bitches!)😬
When you book someone the way they should be. Props to Cody as usual.
Cody deserves more!
Ok, that was good stuff.
this felt so underwhelming besides the fact that the crowd felt dead , the commentary was a straight horrible especially JR he legit feels like he don’t care
Amazing match!!!
I used to have a lil hate for cody cos of how much he puts himself over; but seeing this it proves he knows when to put his ego aside and elevate others. Good shit man
Is this wrestling company real?
1:14 they gotta stop having their refs look like idiots
Watching this match live certainly did not feel like it was only 4 minutes long cause I was still reeling from Malakai's entrance
Malakai is the future.
Just Perfect
I am not sold on everything AEW is doing. But signing Black makes me want to get more invested in the show.  Let's see what kind of waves Punk and Bryan make.
Have to respect Cody for treating the new AEW members so well, putting them over all the time.
The atmosfer its so good
Black's kicks are some of the best I've seen in this industry! This match was FIRE!!!
That look he gives the camera at 4:46 is so fucking ominous. It felt like a nonverbal warning to everyone else that "if he couldn't get the job done, what makes you think you could?"
Does Malakai Black Do Exactly What He Said He Would?  FTFY
I saw this pick up(Tommy) coming a year ago but holy sht never thought yall would bring him in like this gzez Hats off to Cody also this is how you elevate other talents 5 fckn stars
Like how the ref didn’t hide him saying go
I remember 6 months ago AEW was getting 50k views in 24hours now they are close to 1 million. AEW we love you.
the shittiest stage ever
Someone is getting their memory back after their fall from grace
Loved every second of this
Where's Arn Anderson when we need him????
I was there with my little boy, what a match and what a memory! Malakai Black has world champion written all over him!
malakai v pac, like for yesterday, in my veins, please
Cody turnin is bad news for wrestling, cause back then among the elite guys he's the heel that nobody wants to mess with.. Ibushi knows,
JR:  that won’t get it..  Also JR:  OH GOD.. MY GOD! …WHAT DID WE JUST SEE!? …MY GOD IN HEAVEN!
ARW no goog.
Give props to Cody by putting other talents over him.
Go home Cody  Go away heat 4Life
Ohh good ol jr it feels big it is big lmao
Future AEW Champion
Now, that's how you sell a kick and do a job. I didn't expect a finish like that although I suspected Malakai would win.
Malakai Black's gear is lame
Even though it was a short squash they still told a story and had several memorable moments. Impressive -  Compare this to Kofi-Brock !
They actually just showed the whole match!
Now let's hope to God cody puts him over again in the rematch. No need to 50/50 this fued.
Last time it was dog collar match b/w Brodie Lee & Cody and this time its Malakai Black vs Cody Rhodes.  Both the matches were the gold.
Jim Ross is so shocked.  I loved his reaction.
I'm loving this character so far. Everything from his entrance to ring work fits.
3:04,4:29
Malakai - Ultimate Kuuga   Cody - N-Daguva-Zeba
This JR isn’t the JR I remember
He may just get me to start watching wrestling again. Very big fan of his style and just brutality
I wonder if Aleister Black and Malakai Black can wrestle each other soon.🤣🤣🤣🤣
Poor acting by cody😂
"That won't get him",  Jim Ross says while Malakai pinning Cody with one foot. Then  MARKS OUT stunned by the win. Loved that
I like how here if someone is portrayed unstoppable, they actually are unstoppable.
Cody: Cross Rhodes you. Black: Kick to the head. Cody: Aerial move. Black: Kick to the head and have a table. Cody: Missed the countout. Black: Too bad. Kick to the head a third time. I win! Cody: DAMN!
😎👍
Black is trash all he did was kick whole match
Stellar match! Perfect intro for Black. Loved it!
"That won't get him" ... "MAH GAWD MAH GAWD!"
Voilà comment on book un talent du calibre de Black
Was the fall into the table delayed??
Malakai dominated Cody sheesh
Why would they show the reply of that table spot? You can clearly see Cody toss himself towards the table
That’s a statement if I ever seen one lol
Who is that people person by the time keepers table?
Ladies and gentleman the next Undertaker 👏
Cody, the only one to not put a title on himself just to show he can.
Looked a bit ridiculous when Cody clearly waited a few seconds before throwing himself through a table. They can both wrestle, don't need to try and throw in an obvious cheap spot for the sake of it.
Cody best jobber
Black is a real wrestler
This ref is the worst ref.
Cody is a barbie doll
About time black gets some respect
J.R's commentary is slipping,
I like that people thought Cody was going to win. And can't have Cody losing every match. Have Cody look strong and have someone else take him down and that person looks even stronger. Cody did it for Brodie and Malakai.
Next TNT champion 👊
1:22 🤦
Come on Cody that was horrible falling through the table he completely missed you
The top rope spot looked a bit dumb because of the way Cody jumped off rather than fell off. Some of the rolls black did looked weird and unnecessary too.
Right
My personal favorite Black Mass kick ever delivered 2nd to the Leon Ruff one
God bless Cody he threw himself at that table.
1:04 that's called an Imanari roll Excalibur, get your shit straight
I would enjoy wrestling if it was actually real, knowing this was choreographed before makes it all seem silly.
Malakia did what lance archer was supposed to do.  mr Brodie destroyed cody in a similar match .
Even that end promo couldn't get the crowd to boo him. Black is too incredible to be booed.
loved seeing Black back in the ring. love to see him back, love to see him booked well, and man ive missed the black mass. way to go AEW.
Dam that kick knocked out cody 😯
This is the difference between a professional and an outlaw mudshow wrastler.
La singuiente victima es keny omega  va a resibivir un black mass
This match totally mix. . 🥱
Black looked to be on another level in all aspects! So glad he's ALL ELITE
That’s how you put somebody over that was way over already
Well done AEW with the main event. Black was put over perfectly. That finishing move is something else too. I don’t know how he makes it look so real without hurting anyone. Love his entrance too
I'm not big on strapping rockets to new signees but hot damn. Adam needs to beat Kenny for the World title but Black need to beat Page for it. Definitely one of the best In ring debut AEW had done
AEW botch 3.00 to 3.05 🤪😭🤪😭🤪  you sold out  This match already fixed  Fake jump aew botch
Black got a huge huge pop
Jr saying under his breath at the second count "well that won't get him" and then the realization of what just happened, like Jr is absolutely off guard & shook  love it. love ya'll
Such good matches for tv people. It’s great to be alive and watch wrestling again.
Cody needs to stop doing things that make him look dumb..let me just climb this turnbuckle before the guy who likes to kick faces in is worn out
Did Cody have to jump on the table? 🤣😫
There is no greater finisher than the Black Mass
I love this match
03:05 Jim Ross sounding like a Pokemon here.
They didn’t job him out of night one?  Oh wait this isn’t Raw.
Cody catapults himself into the table. Audience chanting: "This is awesome." >> Question is: WHY??? Seems like wrestling fans have lowered their expectations over the years. Quite a cringy moment there...at least for me. My advice: If the table stands too far away for a proper and save landing...then simply don't use it...and maybe give that table bump stunt a second trial later in the match in some sort of way. BTW: Rest in peace, "beautiful" Bobby Eaton.
I love this match so much. Black has been in two of my favorite matches in the past like 3 years. That one with buddy Murphy would be the other obviously lol. Also that strut to the pin was mint.
That Cody jump onto the table was so noticable!!! that's hilarious
0:09 THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID!
Cody put over: Darby Allin, Mr. Brodie Lee,  Wardlow (Cody wins but made Wardlow look great), Anthony Ogogo, MJF.  But yall still call him selfish, Cody is one of the greatest.
Psychology and selling? Putting over “new” people instead of ridiculing them? Whaaaaa????
Does Cody ever win? I get it in this context but it seems he only puts people over and he's not at that stage of his career yet.
God damn Malakhi retired Cody Rhodes?
I Think Cody just seen his nightmare
if they can replace jr with mauro aew will become so much better
Welcome to The House Of Black.
To those saying Cody retired, I’d like to point out that Cody never got the opportunity to take BOTH boots off and leave them in the ring. Cody only got 1 boot off before Malakai attacked him again. I think this is a crucial detail that some are overlooking. Malakai refused to let Cody put his boots down and walk away. Malakai isn’t finished with Cody. He probably wants to permanently injure Cody and send him out of AEW in an ambulance
malakai black is now the undertaker
They have still not named malakai blacks finisher. I know it was called black mass but the commentators didn't even mention any name 🙄🙄
Sure wish Hulu would stop cutting off the last 20 minutes of Dynamite when it records each week ffs
I would love to see him and Miro face each other somewhere down the line for the TNT championship
Cody took that black mass like...wow
5 minutes of black>>>>all matches of Roman Reingzzzzzz
Malakai is definitely a future world champion, that kick is too OP
Black vs Omega AEW world champion Black wins 🙏🏻
Cookie Monster (not from Sesame Street), the Chick Magnet or Montgomery Burns (the Simpsons' / Homer's evil villain boss) will be All Elite, some day.. one day = the First Dance at the United Center, in Chi Town, Chi-Raq, the Windy City of Chicago, iLLinois.
Cody jumped lol but still a nice visual
That Cody jump tho xD
Whos that guy wearing a skirt?
I’ve been really resisting AEW out of 25 years of loyalty. But I think they better now
The princess fallen…..Long live wrestling’s new Dark Lord lol
That the EVP of the company puts you over like this shows such a great humility.
Il give it 2 weeks and he will be back
Okay he needs to vs Chris Jericho
A great start to your career at AEW!
Did they go over the time because my DVR cut this entire match.
You should really think Cody for putting you over because otherwise you wouldn't have got over
Black already looking better then what he was before
Aliester still has that bruise dang he scary
call me at all the homeowners of the company is the only one that is not afraid to put somebody over and doesn't have to have a bed around his waist I respect that cody
It's a common trope when a race horse breaks it's leg, it has no value anymore, so it is euthanized. Black's promo last week told a story an old prized thoroughbred that was taken out to his favorite pasture, fed his favorite treats, then put down.   Black then spent the match working Cody's leg until he couldn't stand anymore. After the match Cody said to the AEW crowd "there is no better place than here" moments later, Black hit him with a kill shot
At 4:29  you can see Cody's soul leaving his body after that Black Mass.  Protect that finisher like OWA. That's cool, badass and looks like hurt people to out them down.
The fact that Malakai is still selling the eye injury is phenomenal… fucking love Tommy End
Way to over sell that table fall…
WHAT A DEBUT
Shout out bro the knees 2 faces shirt at 5:00
He just so damn cold 🥶🔥🔥😭
Cody's fall back through the table looked horrible. Really bad execution by Cody. Not to mention the delay in his fall after being hit.
Cody is one of the greatest I mean the way he sees the bigger picture on things especially to put people over and how he basically made the TNT championship his world championship when he wins it since he can’t challenge for the AEW championship I mean this man has skills and Malakai Black was the truth I really did not care about how short the match was it was the pure fact that Black and Cody had great in ring chemistry
I just came for aleister black
Nice...
Cody doing business the right way…that’s why this company is gonna succeed cause of guys like him
Jr is so terrible lmao
Love from India ❤️❤️❤️❤️
can't believe they let that guy wrestle after killing those psychiatrists
Can't take black seriously with his shorts. Great match though. He should stick with the tights
Cody will be off to do his other shows and then be back in a couple of months to get that win back.
But omg, you people actually think this isn't staged? You morons
Malakai black got the old kane vibe look
Damn... JR’s reaction is awesome. Is like he legit doesn’t know that Black is gonna score the pin fall
Cornette will not like this
Well Done Aew Super star
Cody did what was right
Cody could of beat shit out of him.
Black IS best wresling in thé World AEW 💪 n1
Malaki looked like the Wendigo
They’re making black an a Dutch kick boxer and I love it
Is very bad Move Cody😅3:16
Loved this match. Loved the new look and gimmick and cant wait to see how his story plays out.
cody is what hhh should be
Cody the jobber😆
This is why AEW is the future of professional wrestling. Incredible.
Aew is the best wrestling
Jim: yeah that'll get him. Ref: *counts 3* Jim: Oh shit it did.
Good match but why Cody is no selling at 2:48 and then there is the "Imma throw myself through the table" thing. We don't need 125 spots per match, just good spots.
Now we saw Brodie (RIP Jon Huber) crush Rhodes, but this was absolute decimation. The cover with the foot after only a few minutes...Cody had practically no offence. Massive respect to Cody for that, and Black put on a brilliant performance...future champ, no doubt whatsoever.
Black is a fighter for real
Cody isn't afraid to put over Malakai Black here - he will definitely beat Malakai in the rematch which will also be a Dog Collar Match XD
Would love to see him take on Pac. Now that would be a war.
Cody's promo after Arn got beat up by Black was classic..
Malaki Black absolute Beast. LOVE AEW
Did coby just jumb into a table
have him squash Orange
And THAT is how you make a star. Should've been done a long time ago.
Black and white freemasonry ritual.  People need to wake up.
BLACK MASS looked Awesome... CODY was a real pro putting BLACK over like that.
lmao JR definitely didn't know what his finish was
Malakai black aliester black
Amazing debut for Malakai Black
Now THATS how u debut!
trending uk
Black vs keny
Black looked great, but the match as whole felt clunky. Cody looked amateurish.
Why too soon? Make stories no squash stories
Swear to god live AEW fans mark out for literally anything! An extremely hokey table spot getting "Holy shit" chants is nonsense.   Black looks cool and this was a strong debut, but my god that spot was terribly done.
huge respect for my body cody
3:04 just like he did to Buddy Murphy 🖕
Malakai doing everything to be a proper heel while I’m just sitting here admiring how much of a badass he is haha
Hope to see Kevin Owens and samy Zayn sooooon in aew 🔥🔥🔥
Allah is an idiol sending many people to hell don’t let you’re country or you’re up bringing send you to hell or determine what’s right or wrong jesus is the way the truth and the life which is why Christians face the most prosecution Muslims don’t no one really cares no Muslim would be killed for being a muslim but christians are the most prosecuted group in the world that should tell you something either Jesus is who he says he is and claims to be and you’re wrong   That should tell you something if Satan’s not coming against Islam that should tell you that it’s false you need to come out of that and get to know the true Jesus who can save you and give you peace and joy and assurance of eternal life and get to know the true God  You’ve sinned nor amount of Good deeds can take your sins away there has to be justice a payment you can’t rape a million woman’ and say well God I fed the homeless I get to go to heaven there’s no justice in that and God is just perfect in judgement in God judged that way then even hitler would be in heaven or Satan   Now someone has to pay either you or God and Jesus paid the price for you’re sins all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God the wages of sin is death but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus   So receive the gift
Malakai looks so hot with those tattoos on him and what a talented wrestler
Those shorts tho 😬
Hopefully cody won't go super cody and turn black into just one of the guys there. He has done it multiple times sooo...
That headdress is the stuff of nightmares. Best spooky debut in a decade
They made him look to strong
the leg sweep on the injured leg was *chef kiss
5:12 Everyone pray for Cody :P
I'm not surprised because I didn't expect Cody Rhodes to win or anything like that.  Although it'd be a lie if I said "I knew this match wasn't that long".  I hope Cody will be alright since this match against Aleister "Malakai" Black didn't go so well for Cody.🤷🏽‍♂️
Never seen a half crab look so good
I thought his name was Aliester black.
"Sweep the leg. Do you have a problem with that?" "No Sensei"
I like how the blackness keeps spreading out further from Malakai Black''s eye. It's like an infection.
malakai black looks bigger
This is the start of the return of the horsemen.
Say what you want to say but with the current AEW roster Cody is one of the best professional wrestlers too bad his always not around.
Thank you. Thank you for making Black look so good. Yes he does a lot of that himself, but hell, you guys started things right. Thank you.
If you are going to do a table spot then move the table closer so the jump doesnt look so stupid lmfao aew is pure shit
I dont get why everyone seems to have a raging hard on over this dude?
Perfect start for Aliester Black
Cody should be squashed every match lmao hes garbage
am telling u rn black vs punk will be hell of a match
Malakai Black is Great
Man I wish there was gonna be blood
Should have been cristian getting his ass kicked
Malakai Black is Amazing
Malakai black is so flipping cool i want him to be world champ
Black looked so good here, props to Cody for the great sells too!
Wow!
damn good match
I got Chills.
Loved this match. Tony said it right... Definitely a BIG MATCH feel!
Like the thing they did with Aleister Black's eye
Alister black 🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤
idk if it would work as a heel v heel feud but i can see Malakai beating Miro for the TNT title
Thats how karrion kross should have debut
One match in and Malakai is this big of a star. Good for you Tommy. You deserve it.
AEW just needs Liv Morgan for me to switch completely over.
Would love to see Moxley and Black team up to take out Omega, The Good Brothers, and The Young Bucks
Malakai Black 🖤
This was Awesome!!!! Love them both! Screw Vince!!
Tommy’s attire would’ve been even more perfect if he was wearing his spiked pads and covers
Jr can't tell a kick from a right hand anymore....
JRs commentary cracks me up… bawhhhh gawddd
Going through a table outside then the Black Mass. Take notes that's how a finish should be built up
And people still say that Cody is hogging all the power and buries new talent…. He lost clean to Malakai in his first AEW match in 5 minutes after one black mass and even took the cocky pin.  Clearly Cody’s is burying talent left and right…..
Tommy End looks Amazing in AEW
I am so happy these high caliber matches aren't always on PPV
Now that's how you promote talent in their debut
The next aew champion
Even though Cody loss, but he did it in an orderly fashion. He has signed the most underrated wrestlers in the company, and put over the most underrated wrestlers on their in-ring debut. He has never disappoint the fans.
Great call by Jim Ross on how Rhodes seemed looking for a big, flashy move to end the fight quickly, leading straight to Black kicking Cody off the turnbuckle.
How he rolled into the half Boston was amazing
I'm still pissed at tony and Excalibur for not calling it *black mass* smh
Maybe they’ll have opposite eyes just like their clothes after this match because of that gouge
Aliester Black sounded way cooler
- delayed reaction going through the table after the kick
This is what this guy can offer you, and much more, all the props to Malakai Black
Are you watching vince?
Cody just putting everybody over
Malakai Black is Amazing
"Dutch muay Thai"🤣🤣🤣🤣
That was perfect.
I expected that to be much closer.
Please make this character the next generation Kay fabe character!! Undertaker is gone but this man has a bright future. He needs to go on a undefeated stream especially on PPVs!!! Massive potential
did anybody notice the hint that ric flair is coming soon to aew?
How DEEP is this roster
Alexstar black go challenge Jon moxley if u r a toff guy
Thats a bad sale from cody flying to table
It's the full mech
Black mass is my favorite finisher
I have one gripe that is the in ring gear
Damn puts him over clean in the middle of the ring. What a statement.
Jr be like it is big it feels big 😂 0:14
People praising cody for not making sombody loose to him before putting them over 50/50 booking everywhere
Cody Rhodes Vs Alastair Black
Just imagine Black vs Darby 😍
I have been in martial arts since the late 90s.  I am still amazed he can pull of spinning back wheel kick without seriously hurting the opponent.
I love JR going "That won't get it" then hes like "MAH GAWDD!" seeing Cody get pinned like that
Cody earned my respect. Thank you for putting Black over, you won't regret it
Black could be the new leader for dark order
Malakai black 💧🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Damn what a BADASS match,Malakai literally put Cody through hell
Black vs Pac .
This made me forget all about Cody's talents being wasted on QT for the past 6 months 😭
Malakai Black an Cody it was like breathing fresh air last night I cried emotional rivalries. When I saw Malakai black hit his finisher an the ending I love Cody . I love what this could be. An like Malakai said on Renee Young podcast just give him a chance. last night he did not disappoint. Thank you AEW creating stars using legends rivalries that will be talked about forever. Thank u AEW
Malakai black 🤩
Love Malakai Black. Needs a title ASAP.
3:03 MAJOR  OVERSELL!!!!
Welcome home buddy.
El mejor Luchador SIN DUDA ALGUNA
in spanish No hay ningun LUCHADOR DE AEW que le este A la Altura de BLACK👈
I love Malakai Black
Malakai Black 🖤
Malakai beat the loving hell out of the code man. Lookin real jacked baby!
Sad that no one else sees through it that is just Cody putting himself over as a baby face more. Like he lost his smile and will win in the rematch.  I still see it as Black deserving better than starting out against Cody.
Malakai with those Low Ki 2002 ROH shorts.
Who’s next for Black??
I just wish he kept the ring attire of Aleister Blacks
That is how to book Black!!! Thx Cody..
I just see it all predictably about Cody’s redemption than it is about putting Black over. Which is the only reason he put over Brodie last time as well. Since he knew he’d win the rematch. I still would have rather have seen Black start out against anyone else but Cody. Since he really does see himself as AEW’s Cena either way.
JR late as hell lol
They're so determined to make Malachi a star. Deservedly so. Gotta give it to cody for putting a debutant over like that 💯
And yet again kick off top rope was no where near looking real and then u see Cody jump backwards himself well after the kick was landed awful timing. Then Cody waiting for black mass could of easily put hands up etc. I know this is staged but seriously aew you need to work on your timing massively awful match.
Adam Cole, take notes, either this or main roster debut, choice is easy
Fucking amazing, im so glad AEW isnt going to waste this talent
Crazy to see black still keeping that eye
Alester black?😳...I thought you was still telling us story on Smackdown 😂
get rid of that trunks
A great victory and a beautiful victory. I hope to see you champion AEW All the best to you, Black
Malakai Black 🖤🖤🖤🖤
Superb
Black 👌
"Dutch style of Muay Thai." You mean just kick boxing. SMH
I bet every superstar that win against Cody, thanks to him and give respect as a truly one of the leading man that put talent over and give good chance
Haha..  I was expecting a Cody win.  Then I realised they wouldn't let black lose on his debut 😂😂😂😂🙄
Cody put talent over is smart and genius, thanks to him as the Executive President of AEW. I hope as other superstar rising up, Cody also win AEW Championship.
Awesome. :) AEW is Awesome.
I expect more booo
Malakai Black is the Best
Great match but they should improve on the execution that cody jump to table looked completely fake
What was that commentary from JR?
That's how you put someone over and make them into a monster. Thank you Cody.
Malaki Black Needs A Really Good Attire Not Digging The Shorts
Aew getting better than raw and smackdown
What a great match looking forward to black's stuff
I'm sorry but JRs commentary is just brutal, especially after the kick
Say what you want about Cody Rhodes - But how many others in his position with his amount of power / influence would put people over the way he did Brodie and Black.
This man is dangerous in aew
That Cody table spot was a bit dramatic lol
Aew in india on Eurosport 🤗🇮🇳
Cody deserves respect for pushing up the newcomers like that... even allowing them to pinned him in a humiliating way... HHH never did that
Cross Rhodes reversal 🔥🔥🔥🔥
The way Black Execute the black mass is incredible, perfect every single time. I give credit to every wrestler who put trust on Black's kicks not to fully hurt them.
I love his finisher. That kick is just so fluid and the way it is sold  is just so beautiful.
Great Debut Black
A good match Cody Rhodes you lost again need to step your game up
Where are all the people who said Cody wouldn’t put him over?
Black Mass Kick
Black vs Omega for the AEW championship
what a delayed reaction from the top rope lol
Cody's Jacket reminded me of Homelands outfit from the boys
Malakai Black is Superstar right now
Alestre blak  now malakia blak
Thanks for uploading the full match on YouTube ❤️❤️❤️  In South Asia (Bangladesh) we cannot watch Dynamite on TV 😢😢 So please AEW do something for us because as a wrestling fan we just love YOU ❤️🙏❤️🙏❤️🙏🖤
How can something so short be so sweet?
Lol I love how everyone normally hates Cody then praises him to the ends of the earth when he puts over someone like this.
I'm glad Black didn't get the Ogogo treatment.
Thank you Black
What a banger of a match! Black looked like a BEAST!
Decent match, beside the vomiting appearance of that wherever black guy 😨
Malakai Black is so Great
Channel name ati
You shouldn't have done that replay in slow motion because you can see Cody jump off the turnbuckle himself.
He is Aleister Black u know
Respect for Cody. This was similar to when he put Mr. Brodie Lee over for the TNT title. Hope they push Black to the moon. He's such an awesome talent.
I love JR reaction from ‘surely this doesn’t finish him’ to ‘BY GAWD’
It's time for Malakai Black to be relevant
Man I can’t wait to see Black kick Kenny Omega’s head off…
Malakai Black my new Favorite wrestler right now
Very good match, all around
JR over selling the ending!  Apparently he forgot about Brodie destroying Cody a year ago in 3 minutes but just like last time, Cody A.S.H. will be back to face Malachi and beat him cause he’s Cody “booker man” A.S.H.
Malakai Black will face Kenny Omega for the AEW World Championship.
Alistair black is a demon
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Ya let’s see him against miro 😂
That table bump… woooof. And is JR doing a Joey Styles parody on his call of it? Jesus guys, y’all are better than this.
This was sick match. 😀 Loved it! Anyone catch the Flair Easter Egg? Oh yeah The Nature Boy is coming to AEW where he belongs. Wooooooooo!!!!!!!!!
I'm Sure JR could have but over the finish better . He kinda paused when black stood on Cody. After the pin JR woke up
4:38 that warrior to macho man finish
Not really a fan of Black's attire, but a very good match nontheless
damn malakai is fucking awesome
Cody is a Team Player and Put People Over no Wonder Why he is a Incredible Legend.
YOU ARE A FUTURE WORLD CHAMPION DAMMIT, GOD IT FEELS SO GOOD TO ACTUALLY ENJOY WRESTLING AGAIN
GG!
That was just as lame as Jeff beating Cross
I forgot that Cody can do those really good sells
Excelente AEW y saludos desde Lima Perú
Malakai Black is Amazing
Love Cody, puts talent over bigtime!!
Cody return to the attitude of legacy
Cuz when he was with legacy he wouldn't get beat up like this!!
If Cody can check back into that attitude that he was in when he was with legacy with Randy he is going to be a dominant Force
Damn I love Malakai black fighting style especially when he  attack the legs 👊🏽😎
Cody throw him self on that table.
Also. Awesome calls by JR
Cody is great!
I wanna see him with Miro  it will be good  match
he’s going to take time off to raise his newborn,chill and let him go be a father
One of the best wrestling matches I've seen in a while. I'd rather them waited a week for Cody's promo and just let it go off the air him laying flat in the ring
I love how JR sold that, he reacted almost exactly like how I did. I thought maybe Black Mass was gonna be his "Signature move" to set up a new Finisher when he first hit it but then he just pinned him and I was completely shocked
This match was booked perfectly. Amazing crowd reaction.
Black mass 🥰
The moves Malakai Black using is so Bayman in Dead or Alive series. I'm a Bayman main so I feel so related.
I just dont get how Vince fucked this guy up. Black has that Undertaker shit. Just let him do him. You dont need to "Produce" him. Just give him the space and resources and let him do the rest.
Black need a protected finisher. His black mass should be book the same as the judas effect and the one winged angel.
Cody will bury him shortly and he'll be worthless, like brody lee, lance archer,
So is this gonna be another Brodie situation? Lose to go film something then come back and beat em at the top of their game?
Malakai Black is Amazing
JR is so confused .... He reacts to everything 10 secs later
Nottforgettin d club head Anderson gallows
Kenny omega sucks Yung bucks tooo
That was Awesome !!!!!
Anyone else notice the Leg Sweep at 1:40? Reminds me of Mortal Kombat
It truly is black vs white because of their attire and suits when they confront each other
The best squash match I've ever seen. Instead of the boring 4-5 moves by one guy then we're done we saw him counter all of Cody's signature moves. This was a masterclass. I'm sold on Black in AEW.
It's nice this happened in Jacksonville, but it would've been better if the match happened outside of Jacksonville.
Again most of moves in AEW we could make out as fake...like Cody falling on table
The man from Amsterdam, aka  The Mansterdam
Codey build AEW with his blood and sweat hat's of you codey 👏🏻
I like cody .. he's done well by wrestlers so far in aew!
Malakai squash cody?WHO CARES 😒😒😒😒😒😒😒😒😒283th dislike
So this match 🚮🚮🚮🚮🚮
That was exactly how it should have gone, absolute perfection!!!
WHAT A DEBUT
Vince tried to ruin Aleister Black, but failed :)
This what aew do like WCW
Guys don't hate me but JR just doesn't sound the same. I listened to this and it just sounds like he's lost his fire 🤷🏿‍♂️
That was the worst Jim Ross 'oh my god' ever😂
That Black's pant tho
This is how its done!
Cody is nothing but class putting over the new star Malachi Black. That’s a true professional in my opinion. Hopefully he doesn’t call it quits. And we have him for several more years.
3:05 Good thing that table was there to break his fall.
if you have to say it has a big match feel a few times..... its not really
I forgot just how good Black is in the ring.  His transitions and reversals are as smooth as butter.  The Black Mass always looks so devastating.  I don't know what AEW has planned for him but Blacks a gem of a talent....
“I don’t know if Cody CAN regroup”
The ovation of crowd was like the cherry on the top for Black's debut
Atleast we don't do rollups and disqualification In aew 😏
The kickboxing persona is part of malakai's aew run
Where can I watch AEW. When and where? From the UK.
Cody repeats the same story everytime he takes a break.
3:02 Mundial Ronaldinho Soccer 64
Great way to put over over a new addition to an ever growing and awesome product of AEW.  This definitely is making me love AEW more and more each week!
Imagine Pac vs Black. It would be a classic.
2:46 Oh lord, Cody should've sold it better.
genial 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
My only problem with the match was that the commentators didn’t sell the finish  Didn’t even seem like the match was over  He looked like he hit the black mass but they were silent so I thought it was just a regular kick so I assumed the match would continue. It wasn’t like the squash with Brodie where u kinda knew the match was done because of the shock that he hit his finisher out of nowhere.  If the commentators had sold this it would’ve been a bigger moment for me personally
wtf is that neck tattoo
Soon hangman vs black to take overdark order
Nice match, even though it was pretty much the same one he had with Brodie, but this is what gets a HOLY SHIT chant now a days? What a bunch of marks
Yes and that's a smooth match with a great finish. Cody's spirit is like wake up, wake up..lol
What a debut match for Malakai Black! Cody Rhodes put him over big time here! The foot planted on the chest after the Black Mass for the pin? That is establishing dominance!
Damn They made him so Dominant!!!
Malakai Black has one of the best if not the best finishers of modern day wrestlers. Hands down.
J.r just dusnt have the same energy anymore.
Let's also talk about how awesome the single leg crab was. Black had SO much aggression behind that. Also - loved the unique grip on it.
They have good chemistry
Cody in most matches: “I am a warrior, I will bleed and cripple myself to win a match!  They’ll have to carry me out on a stretcher!” Cody when facing a new signee: “Ow my pinky.”
Love his face paint. Simple but effective
What a Match, AEW has so many dream matches, Kenny vs Malakai, Malakai vs Sammy Guevarra, Malakai vs Darby Allin, Malakai vs Hangman, cant wait.
3:03 when you get kicked in the hand so you throw yourself into a table. Edit: why would they show a replay lol
That look on Black's face when he put his foot on Cody to pin him.  It's like he knew that it really wasn't there anymore and he was disgusted that he had to put him down
Table spot didn't look great but everything else was fantastic
If there wasn't such an awesome storyline of omega page I'd have black win the title straight away
So so good
Vince, if you feel regret right now (or not), it's too late.
Black is maybe my favourite wrestler of all time, I just love his in-ring style and his aura, also his kicks are great and the black mass (unless it’s called something different) is to me the best striking finisher of all time and just a great finisher in general
And thats how yu book him💯
And the undertaker is re-born
Malakai black and bray wyatt best Dark charakter
Are they not allowed to call it the black mass?
What's wrong with his eye
Now that Cody is out of his way because he just destroyed Cody black needs to keep an undefeated streak keep wining and then go after the world title this Guy can destroy omega like that im telling you
And ladies and gentleman this is why you allow wrestlers creative control 🤯!
They talk Cody up like he's god
Some ware in the world triple H and Paul heyman are kicking rocks because they lost  black
How can you botch such a great wrestler?  He is a legit ass kicker.
Glad Cody did a job but that finish was flat as hell
Amsterdam? He’s from Alkmaar 💪🏻
I hope Cody doesn’t do the same thing he did with Brody! He comes back and wins
The greatest debut in AEW history (Black)
One match in AEW and Black looks like the baddest man on the roster.
Every match feels like a goddamn payper view. Dynamite is the shit
Malakai Black as heel wow 😳😳😳😳 absolutely love it
Pure dominance Black got a great debut.
Daniel Bryan, CM Punk,  Ruby Riot, Bray Wyatt, Braun Strowman, Kurt Angle.
I really enjoy watching aew Thank you aew
aew should find muhammad hassan and sign him because he is a charismatic person in the world of wrestling .pls mr khan  give him a chance
Tbh very boring match
AEW become the best show wrestling😍😍
Good match. But that kick off the turnbuckle was so weak. There was no way realistically Cody would have flown off like that. But not a bad match
Malakai Black is a huge deal. The guy has got everything, the entrance , one of the best finishers (it looks way more devastating then one winged angel) and an incredible acting ability. 2.41 looked like a monster who’s going to finish his prey. When he pinned Cody he looked like a evil god. What a debut!
Wow… Cody (In his mind the biggest and most important) on screen AEW wrestler puts Black over strong. Don’t worry folks much like HHH (his role model) Cody will get his win back and bury Black on the way out.
Cody with the Flair wooo. Ric coming to AEW soon..
Cody's great. We all know how good black is but cosy is always putting someone over and is good doing it
Malaikia black vs Cm punk aew championship
Tried to take Malakais moment and be the center of attention as always. House of Black<House Targaryen
His black mass should be called black eye
That table bump was awesome.
That's how you debut a character you're going to build something for. AEW is winning BIG right now.
That kick into the table was soooo delayed and bad and fake looking.. this is why wrestling sucks compared to the 80's and 90's, the art of selling naturally has disappeared
Enhance the strength and support and evolve the weaknesses.... Thats the art of pro wrestling... That table spot was brilliant.. Cody is excellent...Great work putting Tommy over..
My prediction right, black destroys everyone, becomes number one contender against hangman, then when they have a one on one Cody returns ever since this match, screws him on his win, and the Cody gets his revenge with a rematch beating him one on one one... Go ahead writers take my idea I don't even mind
How can he make a single leg Boston crab be devastating. He's so good
Black is gonna have to keep punching himself in the eye. I really don't care for the fake black eye
watch Cody get his win back in also a "tremendous" fashion lol
Well at least cody Rhodes is putting over talent and not letting the EVP job go to his head like the other three muppets in Kenny omega and young bucks are doing just cause Tony khan gave them idiots EVP jobs
Finally people can be quiet about Cody burying talent, there's always a bigger picture.
Just as Brodie Lee tore through Cody in amazing fashion, Black makes one heck of a statement.  The House of Black may have destroyed the cornerstone of the Nightmare kingdom...
That neck tattoo still looks stupid on Cody.
Great match
they should allow women to win men’s championship belts. Just my thought
"My God, my God, what did we just see" - JR trying his absolute best to hype up the finish. It just doesn't sound the same as his calls for austin, taker, michaels, etc. back in the day
Just black isn't color 😉
This Malakai Black seems like a nice gentleman
Wooow😳😯😲😱beauty, wonderful match. I Remember old time
Jim Ross is so poor compared to what he used to be. So calm after a massive move then when Cody was pinned he goes off his nut as if that was a shock to be beat by such a move
It’s a shame that he basically confirmed that him and the Elite guys had a falling out. They are the pillars of this company. Hopefully they see eye to eye again.
That’s how you debut a new star don’t have them lose their first match on your brand
Now I want to see Miro vs Malakai black!! The demon vs God's favorite champion
5 minutes.... a shame this wasn't longer
Better than any Anime combined
Do hope Cody gets to hold the belt for a bit in a few years. He's cemented himself as a legend on his own right for what he has done in establishing AEW.
awesome
Cody blow's
“You gotta break on 4 cause you’ll be disqualified on 5,” you sure about that JR?  He gauged out his eye with the ref looking right at it.
This was wonderful, thank you Cody. I can even forgive if Cody comes back in 6 weeks and gets his win back with how fabulous this was.
Great match
It's such a disrespectful finisher. Just a swift round kick to the side of your head. clean and on point.   Night night.
Crowd sucks
AEW took WWE's doctor too? Wasn't "Doc Sampson" the doctor at ringside when King had his heart attack?
Finally, an AEW match that Cornette wont bury.
Watch Cody, that's called SELLING, kids.
Poor acting by cody
Malakai Black... awesome in-ring gear made in simplicity to allow him effective mobility, precisely executed movements to result dramatic but never overdone... I have two things to point out, which I didn't like and my suspect is that Cody didn't sell them well... I'm speaking of the "jump" onto the table... it was clearly overdone... might have work out in the arena because of the speed of the action but, when you see a replay you perfectly see where and how the kick landed. Speaking of Black Mass... I dunno if it was supposed to hit higher or not but, especially at the end, you can tell he "kicked" the top of Cody's chest, not the face, and I don't see how that could have costed Cody the match. I understand they wanted to give Malakai a quick win to make him look even more powerful and devastating but left me with a lotta bitterness in my mouth. The match should have lasted 5 minutes longer, with another 2-3 big-time-hits, showing a seriously even more dominant Malakai Black and a more resilient Cody Rhodes. I dunno if this is gonna be a feud lasting a couple more matches, which would make this one look like a match in which Cody underestimated Malakai's dangerousness and which would lead to far more intense and finally satisfying couple of matches, letting Black affirm his own dominance and leading to new feuds with other opponents {Bryan Danielson!? CM PUNK!??}.  Anyway, notwithstanding I would give this match just 5 stars out of 10 I'm far beyond happy to see Tommy End {my favourite wrestler, here why I'm so critical, I perfectly know we can expect much much more from him. His arrival in AEW alone is what really made me finally have real interest in this promotion, no other.} finally in-ring again. Welcome, Malakai Black!    ~ About me: 47yo, watching Wrestling since very early 80s.
HHH watching like 😤😑😢
Good match but I'm not a fan of blacks attire
1:11
2020: lost in a second against Mr Brodie Lee 2021: Lost in a second against Tommy End   Dang Cody that sucks😮
1:12 Wooo
Wasnt expecting a squash match but it works. A Black vs Punk or Black vs Danielson match will be fire.
That was a lousy angle to take the black mass from
Cody did a woo before the figure 4 leg lock
That's how you debut someone! Take notes Vince!
Gonna miss having fans at venues, it was fun while it lasted. Hopefully summerslam gets a real live audience.
Booking Malakai like a beast.
Que mal vemdida fue esa patada xd
Wrestling is cool again, it's happenng.
Cody is one of the best wrestlers of generations. Generations like american dream dusty Rhodes and of course dustin Rhodes aka Goldust.  But despite all that aleister black theory. I think he's changed for the worst, matter of fact, any villainous character that can take any hero character of wrestling industry.  Quite Frankly, aleister is more stronger than any promotional wrestling shoukd take a test to the worse.
This is what happens when a business gives you the green light to just be you. Malakai Black is here ladies and gentlemen
Fade to black mass
well, that's actually a pretty decent debut for black, and i wonder what they gonna rename the black mass finisher to
Malachi or Allister Black good with his legs, Cody isn't a match, wether Scripted or not Black is Good.
I love Black if I'm watching AEW cause of him. He's the best ❤️
Malakai black the next líder of the dark order?
Cody is an awesome EVP
AEW
Me sitting back wondering if anybody noticed that Cody got taken out ...exactly like a horse with a bad leg. Wrestling psychology 101. Welcome.
1:12 woaahhhhhh
Wow AEW 👏
This is how you book a demonic monster!
How the hell could the other company release this guy with all this talent. Either way good job AEW.
I literally got goosebumps when Black came out to Amenra, one of my favorite Bands <3
Cm punk vs  black Pac vs  black Danielson vs black Omega  vs black Moxley vs black Allin vs black Aew on fire
If malakai black takes the aew title he would become a legendary final boss
This is awesome thank you.
Please get Buddy Murphy to AEW to get Malakai Black's revenge
Welcome back ninja wrestler I knew you would have dangerous guy from day when I saw you restful first time back to make champions around your waist soon as possible you deserve it amateurs Donnybrook pain you dare to make a proper statement money and the bell nothing else what power needs a wrestler
Ever bodies face at the end was priceless mainly its like they never saw somes head get kicked off before
Cody will always have my respect. He puts wrestlers over. Even when he's a big name himself, he's not afraid to get squashed in order to put someone really over. Hat's off to him.
Its about time they replace jr
What a win for Black over Cody that was shocking man
Fair play to Cody, he can make someone look like a monster
Omg Cody rhodes
Aew is fucking great
JR: "My God! What did we just see!"  Me: "An *** kicking! A world class *** kicking!!"
Was a school boy match lmao!
Well at least this wasn’t the EVP’s burying the newer incoming talent like the bucks did to FTR
Only time Cody puts anyone over is when he is going to film his show. We already know from Brody, that once he is done with the show, he will come and put himself over strong.
CM punk needs to join AEW and job to Malakai Black.
Some mediocre commentary from JR towards the end of that match 😒 it's like he lacks the passion he had and there's no heart in it, imo js
Black Mass!!!
why the f cody look like vergil
This match was on another level! Black’s techniques are so unique in wrestling, and Cody is just superb! Loved this!
I think Black kicked that neck tattoo clean off Cody
Great debut but Cody just destroyed his legacy with this lost
Black lost 1eye because of Seth,Black is a good 👍wrestler suddenly happens.
Now that's a debut!  Dominant,  clean win
Black just yote his soul into the 27th century xd
absolutely great show
Now this is WRESTLING!! AEWW AEW AEW AEW
i felt the promo at the end should have been saved for just the live crowd. its kind of a low key no sell of the black mass
⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
🔥🔥🔥🔥
So is this over now? Just another wrestling angle rushed. Someone tell me why the hell didn't Black keep messing with Cody all the way up to All Out? He definitely could've put another video like his debut one together. I've been waiting for someone to put some kind of story that makes me want to watch each week just to see what will happen.
The thing is, Cody was about to retire taking both his boots off. But it seems like Black stopped it. Taking half of him with him. Hence one boot.  The other boot was still on Cody.  This is an interesting take this story is going.
“That won’t get him”  *gets him*  “MY GAWD”
Pro-wrestling perfection right here.
Cody heel turn
He wearing my old dad's black shorts! Don't wake him up!!
Pure dominance… good god..
1. Black mass 2. Punt Kick 3. Sweet chin music  4. Claymore
Thats how he should pin everyone after hitting black mass
So this is how Black is like when he's booked right. This was amazing to watch :o
He just know karate kicks 👐🏻
Black put over STRONG 💪 just what I expected from Cody and I loved it AEW is Professional Wrestling 👌
ok the commentary team need some upgrade now
This is how you book malaki ( alister) black.
Crazy how Cody gets shit for "winning all the time" although he's only won one ppv match the entire year.. Funny seeing Kenny and the bucks are doing the EXACT thing the Cody haters claim Rhodes is doing.. the bias is real
I don't understand two things!! First,If he's a psychopath like he's supposed to be why didn't he kill Cody and the referee??He killed doctors so why not them?  Second why does a psychopath wrestle??
AEW should add more title.....
He does indeed have these kicks so popular in the Netherlands!
Cody is leaving for go big show 2.0 lol
Loved this.
This was everything I hoped it would be. Also his eye gets more black every time and I want to know what is up with that. Something cool no doubt.
this is proper wrestling, not the 1000 dives and hooky shit
Literally the perfect debut for Black. Great entrance, great tactical move set and fighting style, and the match was booked perfectly.
3.07 shows it was fake. you can see that when Cody gets kicked, he then jumps.
Call Moxley
Cody did fall on the table, perfect acting 😂
Cody can’t win a world title He is willing to get squashed.  And you guys complain when he beats some younger talents to make himself look good.  He has to build his value so when he looses like this it makes it seem even more epic than if it was the same match with a talented jobber instead.
15 AUGEST aew in india I am aceted
Good fight
Massive shock to see him get the win over Cody though to be fair.
Thank goodness Cody put Black over , now can Cody just retire already or just go away ? let other wrestlers have there moment to shine in AEW.
Exactly what I wanted to happen.
Going to have to unsubscribe from the youtube channel because you guys consistently spoil your own show within hours of it ending and I can't open my subscriptions without finding out how big matches end.
His kicks remind me of steve blackman
It's funny how black is supposed to be the heel and yet he gets cheered.
Malakai is not an Undertaker, Malakai Black is a Middleweight Brock Lesnar. He makes everyattacks legit, and painful.
Nice finish
Malakai has a mad theme song doesn't he? Love the flying kick thing he does. Is very Muay Tai or something you know. Enjoyed the match. 👏
Man that's what I LOVE about Cody... he is a great wrestler who obviously has his own ambitions but he's like the opposite HHH... no matter how much influence he has backstage, he's not afraid to lose like this if it's good for business. Great match. Black looks strong. Nothing taken away from Cody
Black Mass👍🏻
Cody Rhodes character has just fallen off a cliff in this company. Same pattern of selling and then the redemption arc, hopefully they can think of something other that the redemption route this time.
I like its Cody...
el 99% de las persona no leerá esto. Pero se que algún día me are conocida en esta plataforma de YouTube  con Dios por delante😟😳..*
That cody fall to the outside was comical.  Well What can you say? AEW  is always a botchfest.
Malakai Black vs CM PUnk.  Malakai Black vs Darby Allin AEW!!!
Cody wasn't match for tommy end
Black and miro has the same move in just like A black and rusev in the other company
Kenta or Katsuyori Shibata vs. Black would be violent yet amazing to watch.
American Black
That Black Mass, smooth
Can't wait to see more Malakai Black in action, hopefully he can win the AEW World Championship or the AEW TNT Championship in the near future
Milakay sounds like something from like a cartoon or tv show. His entrance sucks and cosy should of not put him over. Cody is like John Cena of aew and should bury people
Alstra black mass
Everything about this just makes me think please keep this man far, faaaaar away from Vince
he is the hottest thing in pro wrestling today
You know what makes a great table spot? Not delaying the "fall" for a few seconds and not jumping a couple of metres when a normal action would be just to fall off 🤦🏻‍♂️
@3:06 jr with the oh my god oh my god, just isnt the same as the “good god! Good god! Good god oh mighty!!”
Booked Right 💯🤘🏾
3:20 “Pinpoint accuracy into the face…”, meanwhile he barely his the bottom of Cody’s arm and they still replayed it and talked about how good it looked!!
Cody knows he's over and he's a star, so taking the L won't hurt him. Malakai Black looked like a star, and that Black Mass is still a thing if beauty! They set Black up for great success!
I'm notice AEW have zero storyline match .Whoever on debut sure have big match big event .anyone agree ?
Awesome debut for Black and big props to Cody for putting the man over in a big fashion. Proves yet again that AEW knows what they are doing with the new talent. I am a fan.
First win malakai black match in AEW, he defeat former TNT champion.👏
Malakai Black squashed Cody Rhodes, just like how Brodie Lee (God rest his soul🙏🙏) defeated the latter. Respect to Cody for putting Black over. Plus, his Black Mass is damn effective.
Vince screwed up!
This match Is too short i want this rematch again  20 august rampage at Chicago pay-per-view match
Cody over acting
I’m sorry but dynamite needs to fix their commentary team for moments like this. Great play by play duo but no emotion what so ever for special and big moments like this. Which is a shame since at one point Jim Ross was the great of all time when it came to showing emotion.
Such good shit damn can’t wait for the arrival of Daniel Bryan and punk this show will officially be the best it’ll have great wrestling and stars
Malakai Black 🖤🖤🖤 Cody Rhodes 🤍🤍🤍
Malakai moving like a new man now in AEW now he is away from the PG style
IF Bray Wyatt comes to AEW, this is the match to make with BLACK. FOR the AEW world heavyweight title.
Malakai Black vs Miro for TNT
Quick work on Cody
Malakai whopped that ass, damnn🔥🔥. Keep building him up, he has potential to be AEW world champ. Such a cool character man, Darby should worship him not Sting😂
Sign Brock Lesner, Braun Strowman, Bray Wyatt, Lars Sullivan and Hammerstone. Aew needs more big guys in the heavyweight division.
I hope Malakai goes for the TNT Title. He's the only one on the roster who's got a chance
AEW sucks...
man i love this!!! way better then that other company ;) AEW AEW AEW AEW AEW!
finised ko 😰😰
Yeah I get that Cody is putting wrestlers over but this makes me look at Cody as a stepping stool for new comers
That's a mean ass half Boston. Man had that set in DEEP
That black mass was 🔥 Malakai black finna get that push the others wouldn't give him
The other night I was thinking, That'd be cool if Darby did a coffin drop on the ⚰,  and then he did! Tonight I was hoping Malakai would come back out and end that speech, then he hit him with the crutch! 🤣🤣 AEW always giving me what I want, thank you 👏👏👏
We need bray wyatt on aew team with black and Erick young
Awesome
Lame match.  Cody just looked like a 2 bit jobber
That table spot didn’t surprise anyone
Nice work
Most powerful kick
Man those strikes during 1:21. That's awesome stuff!
Well hot damn...AEW knows how to deliver.
Black is my new favorite
Now this is what makes me want to watch wrestling again
Black maas ko'ed the nightmare
Can’t wait to play him in the aew video game
Tommy is the End
Even though it is a quick match, I absolutely appreciate AEW for posting this whole match for free.
Wow malakai was smooth as ever
Black should be thankful to Cody.. Best seller..
I would changed the pin but nice match.
What a squash, Cody is the man putting over new talent, he sold that leg work so well but I'm still unsure about Malakai 🤔
He finally put someone over, good job Cody
Coming in December. A 4 way  with black. Miro gallows and punk   for the title
This will go 3atches with Black gettimg 2
Awesome debut
Malakais ring gear needs some work lol
CRAZY FINISH!!!!
Flair to AEW!!!!!!! Cheers Cody for the hint.
This is exactly like his !atch against Brodie Lee. He was dominated from start to finish.
Codys legs are huge compared to Malakais Damm I remember when Cody was a skinny newcomer
Maybe don't slow it on Cody's obvious jump LOL
LETS GO MALAKAI BLACK!! 🖤🖤🖤
Here's a sad truth , No matter how much Cody put over some talents, people will still call him overrated.
Very disappointed by the spoiler title...not everyone is from the US and able to watch it live you know? Only way to avoid these spoilers is by unsubscribing to your channel...
Welcome to House of Black
Apologiesed match
Word is cody really got knocked out! Dam! Wondering if he will get in trouble for that
My favourite wrestler After Undertaker  The Dark lord of black mass🔥🔥🔥
This weeks dynamite seemed poorly rehearsed, even malakai's kicks weren't as clean as before.
aew show is awesome... except the elite segment... sucks
Will watch more AEW if they sign Juventud 👍
Could Ric Flair be going to AEW after that reference from Cody 1:11 🤔🤔
Rules in AEW?
Cody nod
Am I the only one who finds this moment 3:18 funny? I had to laugh at that little reactionary pause from Cody before he flings himself off the turnbuckle 😅
Dude Jr please just retire already you can’t act anymore it’s cringe as
I think Black should've done one more brutal sequence then finished him off with that slick Black Mass with the same foot on chest pin fall. Would've been more dominant (I'm thinking Lesnar-Cena Summer slam type domination)
The table spot was not needed here everything else was okay
Black is insane talent
Cody stood toe to toe with him look for more matches down the road
Cody is the stepping stone literally, props to the forever top midcarder.
Lmao we gonna ignore Cody just yeeting himself onto that table?
I don't know for what cody get so much hate just for not putting over an unknown upcoming ogogo  The guy has put over darby mjf brodie and now malakai big time he bring that big fight feel to every match  Stark Eddie all are in aew because of his tnt title run  If he beat ogogo god damn it he deserve it he maybe evp booking but he earned it for himself
This match had put Black over in his debut
I subscribed  to your channel  and I joined the Notifications Squa
Cody did damn good by putting black over.  To those that are complaining about the few he didn't put over, Penta, ogogo,Archer...WTF?  Is he supposed to lose EVERY match?   He's put over a good number of people and in great fashion.  Cry elsewhere.
Awesome match 👍
only one word 🔥🔥🔥🔥 its fire
Lol his right eyes is still different from what Seth Rollins did to him
Black dominated as he should have, but of course Cody has to make it about himself afterwards with a lame retirement hint that nobody believes.
For some reason, I want to see Malakai vs Lance Archer. Great PPV level caliber.
This ruled. Plain and simple.  Also, JR sounded a bit odd. Was that audio problems or is that how JR naturally sounds now?
I was there for this it was crazy!!!
Full match eh?
The hells up with the black spot on blacks eye
This debut was great choreography in selling Malakai Black. Major credit to Cody for putting him over in such style.
Amazing debut!! Already feels like a star!
I totally agree about Malakai Black’s similarities to Jake the Snake, albeit Black is a much better athlete.  It would be great if he tag-teamed with Lance Archer, or better yet they started a Dark Order-style power stable.
This is WWE's biggest loss up to date
Why Cody jump rightly on table
So you are telling that black one side face has really gone black !! Ok
Hhh or randy Orton will never do this but Cody being a corporate executive jobs for his wrestler
We are fucking competition long live AEW
That Cody delayed fall to table is as wack as Batista flailing and falling backwards after a 3 second delay
black looked awesome and cody sold him really well, table spot was daft and unnecessary though.
Cody is such a pro. That is how it's done cena.
Can always tell when JR is into the match/story. He was great for this.
Almost a perfect debut. My only critique, maybe don’t wear those shorts next time.
Seems like JR doesnt know the black mask kick is the finisher XD
I don’t love to see Cody loosing under 5 min..it should at least be a 15 min match, no matter how much powerful the opponent is
Why they are not using Black Mass word 🔥🔥👍👍
Cody will be back changing his hair Black
Cody taking one for the team to put Black over. What a legend.
That leg sweep was straight outta Mortal Kombat 👌
JR is an all time great commentator.. but just take him off of tv.. everything just feels so forced from him and I feel none of that “Good Ol JR” passion anymore
พี่มะระไก่ โคตร​เท่
Man that black mass😍😍 I can put it in loop and watch it all day.
Good debut but the delay between Cody getting hit and falling through the table was painfully noticeable.
Amazing
I love how real Malakai Black feels. Working stiff and making it feel like a real match.
I like malakai black
WTF! Black kicked  him so hard his soul was in the future giving his retirement speech. No not yet Cody!
what will be the name of the black mass now? Dark Mass ?
Now that’s how you make stars and NOT waste momentum. Take notes Vince
Black Vs. Bryan Danielson would be good wrestling.
Beautiful technical wrestling for a change!
Should be a PPV debut match.
Why crowns shock? Lmao
Love a old ol slow motion thigh slap
We have gathered here today to celebrate the death of cody Rhodes.  He got destroyed on nation television
Is it legal to poke in eye during match. Ref didn't give a damn about that. 😂
Jr' s "oh my god" i wish they got Joey Styles as a part of commentary section
Man, Cody's loss was heartbreaking
Booked STRONG AF!!!!!!!!!!!!
I wonder if Cody is warming things up for Daniel Bryan to enter the scene to show how anyone can use determination to reach their goals. The Cody retirement storyline could involve Daniel Bryan and the Yes era arrives in AEW.
cody is a gentlemen ...he knows how to do that for a company to survive
Did JR just say the black mass was a 'solid right hand' ?
Fhek mache ,,🐗🤣🤣🤣
Very nice
Awesome ✌️
After the shawn Micheles,,,  black is the best kicker😇
JR can't understand what he's watching lately lol.
Hi
1:10 RIC FLAIR TO AEW CONFIRMED  Or is it not because Cody didn't apply the Figure 4?
Who wants to see# black vs omega@
Small thing, I love that in 2021 we are seeing a single leg boston crab being used so effectively and put over as being so painful.....the old school submissions are still the best!
This was an excellent match
HOUSE OF BLACK
1:11 Hey!!! That"Wooooooo" sound might be sign that Ric Flair will join AEW😍
Cody telling out a heartwarming and a emotional promo to the audience and Malaki comes by and ruins it, that's a truu heel
Black is collecting retirement boots, baby. Next up for my boy? KENNY OMEGA
He made Black look damn good
BLACK MASS
So really cody ur goin out like this if ur retiring.  And kick to the face.  From 1 black eye Willie.
THIS IS REAL WRESTLING!! THANK YOU AEW
Jim Ross just bore witness to The Black Mass.. Lol
Cody knew he gonna lose tonight that's why he's act like injure
Something else is coming for malakai black i think its bray Wyatt
This is a STAR making squash
Is Cody trying to make black famous with such a quick loss and injured knee gimmick
So that finisher's gonna be super protected huh. Love it.
What a dude. I guess he's been portrayed as an absolute monster wherever he was before AEW.
I love they were doing the good vs evil routine.... Michaels vs undertaker....
That table spot was fkn corny. That wouldn't happen in a regular match. SPOTS! SPOTS! SPOTS!😂
Can't wait until Cody comes back from filming to take away another guys rise😒(Anthony, Brodie and Black).
They compare Black to Jake the snake. Gtfo. Zero comparisons.
Jim Ross needs to retire. Didn't even realize that was the end of the match. Pathetic old man.
I really hope Cody does not retire. Like for real?
Fudu match.cody never loose match
Welcome to the House of Black Cody Rhodes
YESSSSSSSS!!!!! Now that was a match!!! This how most matches should be AEW
Jesus christ, Black is just so good. One of the few who just emanates pure star power! 💀
This is how you put someone over. That’s cody Rhodes for you. He’s big enough of a star to do that.
This should have been a ppv. We need more
battle of the two faces malakai vs darby woot woot!!!..... n malakai is sooooooo the new dark order leader material....make dark order DARK again...now they're just some clown order.... but I LOVE them so much!!!!!!
5*
whooooooooooooo
I love black and black mass move😈😈😈😈😈😈
3:06 JR becomes a parrot (circa 2021)
Let me guess, Cody is gone for a couple weeks and then comes back with black hair
Lol Cody talking momentum to land on a table who seems to be there for no reason (nothing on it, no chair near it or people)...
I thought this match would be longer and I was shocked, I thought was gonna retire and I'm like two shocks in one night! But, low-key moment of the night the lil girl face he gave the belt to. She kept smiling that moment made her night, that's what these wrestlers live for to make us fans smile and give us happy moments
How it should have ended
THIS is how Black should've been showcased all along! It's not fukn rocket science! When you actually let talent have control of their own character.......Magic happens! No sitting in a fukn closet waiting for someone to knock on the damn door! From the entrance, to the match itself, THIS was just pure Old School Magic & was fukn awesome!
I think Malakai was so dominant that this video was the whole match. Astounding.
if they keep pushing him hard enough he can become a modern era undertaker
Cody making us believe he was actually retiring lol. He'll be back to continue his rivalry with Black in about 6-12 months after he's finished doing other projects. Meantime I enjoyed Malakai rightfully squashing Cody in this match.
Cody is highly skilled in the ring and on the mic. However, I find him to be very annoying and I'm totally sick of him. The big lights always need to shine on him, everything is always about him, he is in love with himself to an offputting degree and cannot lose a match without injuries or cheating or now, faking retirement post-match. That long speech he had diminished Malakai's impact, it should have been his moment. Win the match and end the show. Done. Yes, Malakai got extra heat for attacking him before he could take his second boot off but because it was Cody, I hated it. I just wish he could be utilized slightly differently. Win 85% of matches, sure. Use him as talent enhancement, sure. But please cut the crap about his endless ego-driven speeches and storied losses.
Why is this match even given here for free?
omfg this is the best thing ive seen in wrestling since probably the attitude era everything is spot on  amazing job
DEAR VINCE  THIS IS WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE WHEN U HAVE A STAR ON YOUR HANDS BUT DO NOTHING WITH
A moment of silence for Cody he was welcomed to the house of black tonight
This is how it’s done. Great match by Black!
Amazing table bump wowwww
Dafuq was that pointless promo after match
Black mash
Kudos AEW. Got me interested in sports entertainment again
Fantastic debut for Malakai Black! Side note: This is probably Cody's best wrestling gear yet.
I love AEW is doing this but why is it always cody rhodes? Cody needs to do it less and goldberg needs to do it more lmao.
THIS is how you book Tommy End. 👏👏👏👏👏👏
Big fight feel, glorified squash match, and right outcome. Making Black a straight up killer, I love it.
Ek reason mila are dekhna ka alixter black
JR at the end of the this match was cringeworthy. Beautiful match though. Great storytelling
That was awesome!
Let’s goooooooooooooo!!!!
Vince McMahon what did I just do
Anyone else get chills on his entrance the same way when The Fiend made his entrance? Wooo damn
Big E will rip him off....by Cody Rhodes♍®
I was straight marking out for this match.
AEW 🔥🔥🔥🔥
3:04 That oversell
*Cody gets kicked in the head while on the top rope* Cody immediately after: Hmmm, now let me launch MYSELF off of here through a table  I'm sorry, a lot of these AEW spots have made no sense and have looked terrible
Black vs punk vs bryan
Black is just so damn good in the ring
Cody jumped on that table he could’ve finessed that spot a little better….Jim Ross is still gold
malakai black should join dark order
Outfit was too much & not needed cuz hes awesome anyway & the makeup works perfect.
Black is one of the most believable workers in all of pro wrestling 🙌
absolutely amazing !!  i freaking love seeing the crowds expression ! DAMNNN !!
The American Nightmare Cody Rhodes vs Malakai Black in this is amazing match in AEW on Dynamite at Homecoming in this is amazing match i like soo much see this is two amazing athletes together inside the AEW ring for the frist time ever amazing match and amazing victory by Malakai Black him is amazing athlete 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
New leader of Dark Order there
BOOOOORRRRRRIIIIIIINNNNGGGG!!!!!!!!
I was rooting for Cody.  But that kick he gave Cody was smoother than Sammy Davis Jr 🤭🤭🤭🤭🤭🤫
As much as I love Jr it's time for him to retire you can't get out of goddamn word without stumbling
YES LEKKER TOMMY! WAT EEN OVERWINNING! 🇳🇱🇳🇱🇳🇱❤🤍💙
TELL JR IS WAS A RIGHT FOOT...NOT HAND
Malakai Black’s wrestling debut in AEW was booked perfectly. Credit to Cody Rhodes for putting Malakai over in a big way.
Malakai Black is the Future AEW World Champion
Black kicks Cody clearly throws himself off the top rope Such an amazing kick by Black
I do firmly believe that Cody will retire soon, i think there is some truth. With all the amazing talent they have i think he will take a step back to let newer talent get more spotlight. He could run the business and start helping more backstage.
Malakai Black's entrance music reminds me of the movie Hereditary it's freaky in a really good way
Kudos took an upset loss to put over new talent. BRAVO, CODY!  So glad you made the RIGHT call!  If you had won that match I think everyone would have rioted.  So glad we don't have to worry about that. Fantastic debut of M. Black. Awesome entrance and music too.  I really hope you guys can leave Daily's Place soon. I can't take that location anymore due to the pandemic memories. Crossing fingers for smooth touring travels again.
I’m sorry but my brother said who Malaki  black was and I said Emo HAHAHAHA IM SORRY
CHILD OF THE CORN WINS
Black vs Pac or Archer
That crossroads counter was clean 🔥
Malakai matches are always something else to watch
WTF is Malaki Black wearing man?!😭😭😭
As a wrestling fan i feel so happy to see him on aew ❤
tht cody's jump from top turnbuckle🤣🤣🤣🤣
Now we can have malakai black vs darby allin
pentagon vs black
3:20 JR: What impact! Me: Where? 👀
CODY PUT PEOPLE OVER THE WAY YOU SHOULD PUT NEW COMES OVER IN PROFESSIONAL WRESTLING
All you dick heads talking shit about Cody and like the class act he is, he put Black over. CLEAN. Great fucking match, guys! AEW! AEW! AEW!
Thinky Aew
Cody took an absolute beating to introduce Brodie.   Here he took some nasty kicks and a crazy top rope table bump.  I kinda think he sacrificed his own damn leg for this one.
Black's theme tho 🤘🤘
This was the only good thing to the show Young bucks and omega suck and are awkward as hell on camera maybe they should just fall back be happy they got this done for the fans wrestlers and celebrate making history but for God sake young bucks should just right/book the stories for the show if they love wrestling so much Kenny idk maybe but differently not a top star..JIM IS RIGHT! JIM IS RIGHT! JIM IS RIGHT!
Can't wait for 15th August... Aew coming to India 😊
I just love how Cody has no problems putting over newcomers. Just goes to show you Cody how classy the guy is. If this were John Cena, Hulk Hogan or Bill Goldberg they would refuse putting over anyone over themselves because they think hey are above every other wrestler.
Everyone talk about how Cody never puts anyone over. Accept when he constantly does
What other company puts a main event of their show in full on youtube lsss then 3 hours larer this was a great start for black dont blow it in the rematch
What happend to his eye🤔
Cody was late on that spot... couldve been great but oh well
Another lame-ass camera work kudos to the crew. 3:03
Holy cow! Cody putting Black over!! And Malakai looking like a monster! Fucking awesome!
Its protected and we respected
ดีใจได้ยินคำว่ามวยไทย😆
What did we just see? What we saw was Cody leaving to make TV shows only to comeback and squash him in the rematch. More garbage. This would've meant so much more if Cody hadn't already done this shit.
حرامات كودي روز يخسر
So Cody no sold the move and cut a promo at the end of the match.... bruh this company just keeps getting worse every week
I LOVE THIS COMPANY
All we want is CM Punk vs Malakai Black
That was a murder!  Im calling the police!
That was incredible AEW is just so good.
Lmfao that commentary during and after the black mass was god awful
Fack
I feel like Black felt this was more of a "you thought you knew how good i was, when really i barely got started ". He just seemed so much smoother. I like this.
and come on lol @3:05 cody just literally sent himself to the ringbell table XD
Does jr not know that the black mass was black’s finisher? Sheesh
That's Cody for u  That's AEW  They know how to built stars  And Cody is surely can run the show better then the other promotion  Great debut from black  Want more destruction from black i mean I more haunting and destructive like the undertaker  Well done AEW
Love how the 5 mins play out Cody pretty much has the same aura like Moxley he'll be fine this was big for Black & he'll truly benefit from this.
JR commentary is so cringy now...
Them trying to bleep out the “holy shit” chant was funny lol
Man he did it for the business he’s the only one doing it.. Man malaiki would be the perfect leader for the dark order. He can beat with that move black mass!!! Everybody else is doing there 2013 nerd stuff.the so called the elite one thing they don’t do is put people over
I love watching when that black mass connects I know it's only a back heel spin kick but it's so beautiful
Black wanted to thanks audience and Cody however his character didn't allowed it... But his eyes said it all
Fantastic i am glad Cody put him over he deserves it.
Somebody keep the Timekeeper's table away from Cody......
black mass never connected
We need Murphy Vs Black.
Black the best
Oh mah gaw, oh mah gaw
John Cena and Roman need to take notes of how to put ppl over clean
Alistair Black didn't even touch Cody as he fells from the corner through the table 🙈🙈Fake...
Itʻs blacks SILAT training that make him dangerous!!
Black baby 🔥🔥🔥
Man, that was just vicious.  I don’t think I would call this a squash though.  At least, it didn’t feel like a squash.  It felt like a systematic dismantling of a skilled opponent through superior technique and it didn’t really feel like Black went over the top with any of his moves. No unnecessary brutalization of his opponent, but rather each move felt almost surgical in nature and had distinct purpose to it.  And Cody sold those moves like they were doing real damage.  He didn’t lose, he was beaten, and there’s a huge difference between those.
Damn Baldur just got one of the best debuts ever     I hope Kratos comes to AEW to stop him again
Imagine the confrontation between Black and Sting
Khali pin style 😅👍
Hell yeah! I wish he was using Tommy end though it’s a much better name
I feel giving this away on free tv was a mistake.   This confrontation (and continuing the build) would’ve been worth a ppv alone
Love how everyone was shocked when Malakai won.
I love how black missed the knee up top and cody still jumped onto the table
I really believe that a great storyline 4 AEW is Dark Order vs The Elite where D.O. is focused/determined, twisted & dark because of their new leader, Malaki Black or even Bray but in my opinion, Malaki would fit the role better. He even renames the group the "Black Order' & goes on to convince Page to come back & he changes him like he did the rest, Page becomes the Dark Cowboy/Horse of the group & with Malaki’s help, he wins the TNT championship from Miro, while Malaki get the AEW championship & other members of his group get the AEW tag team championships & maybe even the Impact championships. But, 4 now I would like teaser where Malaki watches the group from afar every time getting closer to confronting them & he even leaves messages that tell them he can help them be better, same 4 Page. Because I want this to start happening, when the Elite are at their most dominant, when truly no one left to fight. Then, Malaki as the leader tells them to wait 4 the right time the strike but as they wait, we see backstage segments where members of B.O. are watching them even do some disappearing acts. When Malaki does decide it's time, it's when all members of elite are in the ring & while they're talking, the lights start flickering which Kenny says is distracting then they turn completely off then back on, which shows the Elite in the middle of the ring surrounded by B.O. members inside & outside while all members are wearing masks excepts 4 the ones who already have masks, they just change theirs to different ones. Anyway, we see Malaki w/Page & someone else he recruited, coming to ring, also wearing masks,  especially to Kenny's face to declare War & to get their most prized possessions, their championships, every last one. Lastly, Malaki does replace some of the members with new members, adding some muscle to the group. Malaki has meetings like Brodie did but we see in the back,  Cody's shoe(s) on a wooden stand hanging from the wall, while across from it, is a pic of Brodie Lee to honor him & show respect that even Malaki gives. These  backstage meeting segments only happen after they declare war on the elite too. The wrestlers he recruits & convince to join him are Butcher, Blade & Bunny,  & Nick Comoroto, maybe even Jimmy Havok & Chaos Project, mostly Serpentico, if he/they can.
Some idiots want Cody to loose all his matches
Can u believe this shit was only 5 minutes?! *FIVE MINUTES!!* Great fucking match gentlemen.
Haha lol...cody throws himself towards the table...even a 3 year old can understand it by seeing this match
If it ain't Dutch it ain't much...
The Table Spot was bad. But it can be turned into something like Malakai Black can do some black magic and forced Cody to Jump and even Retire.
Respect for putting him over
Malakai Black vs Miro, or Malakai Black vs Kenny Omega, which one would you choose?
Amazing
Malakai Black has arrived!!!
Yo AEW you should clip Malakai Black's entrance, it was siiiiiiiiick.
deym, Malakai Black is perfection...
Overselling by Cody 😕
This is how you book him
Malakai Black is just shitty name, sorry.. it reminds me of the Mordecai flop lol
Black is next superhero
Malakai Black Eye 😂
WTF was Dr Sampson doing? He looked like a damn faith healer.
I love me some Cody Rhodes. He's a professional wrestler who knows how to be professional even when others are not.
Cody is a true team player in AEW as he always looking for long term for the new and up and coming wrestlers to get their shine.
🤣🤣🤣🤣  he is the HUSH of prowrestling today   welcome to dark teritory
This match setup was rushed. They could have built up Black to be a real threat by having him go thru the entire nightmare family leading up to a match with Cody
This was quite something
Happy for Black, but Cody's the real MVP.  I believe in AEW supremacy !🙌
I thought Cody was still in his prime.. Too soon man, too soon.
What a wonderful thing it is to see a promotion that wants to make stars.
AEW is starting to really gets its groove with some of these finishes.  Genuinely surprised by that.  Good match.
Now that’s how you make a debut 🔥🔥
Swaaggg black
Aew# the best pro wrestling in tv 1
I honestly think black will defeat Miro for the TNT Championship
Malakai black gave Cody Rhodes The Angry Pirate early 😂😂😂
2:07 - I don't think legs are meant to bend in that direction...
3:23 pin point accuracy by cody to the table😃😃
I wanted a big ppv style match...I wasn't ready for a squash match but I loved it with the promo at the end that made me want more...this company just gets it!!
That kick to Cody on turnbuckle man, just sharp and vicious
Malakai should create his own faction... or just lead the Dark Order
The promo was lame..the match should have lasted longer..
1:12 ric flair confirmed AEW😃
That counter of the Cross Rhodes was a thing of beauty.
Release Jade's match
3:03 WTF was that? Jim Ross failed. Don west would have been perfect for this moment
The way Cody jumped off the turnbuckle to sell the kick lol
how is this mans right eye STILL bruised. man had his eye dug out a year ago. how is it even bruised? its not like they punched him lmao
Is going actually going to retire at 36 bro really wow we truly will never see Cody as world champ
Wow..Black Mass..What a finisher....
The Black Mass is the sickest looking finisher ever!
3:02 absolutely beautiful
He learned from when they called Cody HHH
That was... Amazing
If the rumors are true, when punk and Daniel come in, I can't wait for matches against malachi
This is some good quality wrastling
That Freakin Black Mass
Malakai beat the hell of Cody that was amazing
Would've been cleaner if Black pushed him into the table
Cody is jobbing to broddie lee, darby, and now malakai black 😂😂😂
Black is already steal this show for sure he's easily The Best Superstar on AEW right now!
What a match
“It is big Tony you’re right. It feels big and it is big” 0:08 🥴🥴🥴🥴
No one is ever truly good
Who remembers dashing Cody Rhodes ??
Loving how Black's eye makeup is spreading
Now that's a debut.  Much respect to Cody Rhodes for putting Malakai Black over very strong.
Wtf is he wearing? Why is he using short pants like that? It kinda remembers me when he's in the raw underground lmao. Cmon, make him use his actual wrestling gear.
Man I forgot how good Black is, I was absolutely mesmerized by him. And the finish with him standing on Cody for the pin omg. What a debut.  Also his entrance is fucking amazing
Cody Rhodes was just fade into black.
1:12 Rick Flair to AEW confirmed!!!!
Black 😘😘😘🔥🔥🔥🔥⚡
Okay obviously all this was incredibly cool but shout out to the very small touch just after the match ended, where they cut to a woman who legitimately looked like she was praying in the crowd, that was nice and really demonstrates how you build a character like Malakai Black
Man my respect for cody how grown even more after how he has put over black in this match
Only with the caliber of a man like Malakai Black, can dethrone the God's Favorite Champion, Miro.
And this is how you debut a new star in your promotion.  Are you watching Vince?
I love the standing pin there, everyone expects a break there... did not happen. Just great
Fake
Only complaint is that the kick from the turnbuckle threw the table wasn't needed. Other than that it was a pretty solid match.
Hope black gets his well deserved main event push considering he is one of the most over  talented and charismatic wrestlers on the roster
if anyone is a "lame horse" that needs to be "put down," it has to be Jim Ross. He sounds fake, emotionless, and tired.. a shadow of his former self..
aliester black
J.r commentary just isn't what it used to ne almost like hes trying to hard
0:11 that's what she said 😉
Cody don't make stars, He make superstars 🔥🔥
Waoo
Black looks like a superstar 🔥
Man I am glad they are putting over talented wrestlers. Hope black gets a run with the aew world championship in future and puts great matches
Jim Ross is wrong, no one was chanting Cody or Malakai Black, they were chanting Holy Shit J.R.
I love Black's style. Mixing amateur wrestling with some martial art strikes mostly Muay Thai. I see big things with that wicked man. He's awesome
3:00 lol
Stardust vs Aleister Black
Get JR off the commentary...
EXCELLENT MATCH!!!  MALAKAI’S ENTRANCE, OUTFIT AND STRIKES WERE ON POINT!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
3:04 « He did Twice to Buddy Murphy's Jaw.
Black vs miro next
There is Cody, there is Black but still God bless the crowd ❤️
Spectacular entrance match
Cody teasing a retirement...imo was USELESS...
Jean claude van damme spinning heel kick
Cody is boring wrestler..
They give us the entire main event match.
fake wrestling
3:03 Cody sell it very well tho🔥🔥🔥, but hard-core wrestling fans will notice th weak point here
AEW is the new home of Black
4:29 here it is. Built different.
I cant decide if his new gear is better
mox vs malakai 💪
rektD
🔥🔥
This could be the star of a great wrestling company
🖤🖤🖤
Cody got injured early on his leg, Malakai exploited that injury which hindered and grounded Cody's mobility, then Cody was kicked and fell outside through a table. He barely beats the count but by that point he was too beaten to avoid the inevitable and Black's lackadaisical cover just put the icing on the cake.   Simple perfect story a convincing, dominant debut by Black and no BS Superman comebacks or overblown booking. Perfect selling by The Great Cody Rhodes to put over Malakai. The match is what it is and that's just perfect. Great job to both guys.
Cody doesn't work Augusts.
And people say that Cody always book himself to win.....idiots
HHH must be disappointed at his father in law while watching this.
I'm enjoying Black's mma trunks look, always thought he should've went with that look after appearing on that one Raw Underground with MMA trunks.     Good to see he agrees, and he still managed to keep his dark feel with them as well. Also awesome way to win his first match here.
Didn’t know Muay Thai was Dutch ..
He should have put Cody's boot back on to send a message saying he isn't done with him yet
That, my friends, is how you book a shock squah match. Malakai instantly making his presence known.
Delay drop to the timekeeper's table ........😔
Whaaaaaaaaaasaaaasaat
Jesus this was vicious- even when they started with a lockup, they did so like they were trying to throttle the life out of each other, and every bit of Black's offence looked like it was intended to _maim_ Cody. And while some people have criticised JR for his performance in AEW from time to time, he was spot on for this match. Brutal.
Cody is the best in selling moves❤️ absolute legend 🔥 He can make anyone a superstar ❤️
Now it's time to bring Murphy for Black new opponent
WELCOME TO THE HOUSE OF BLACK AEW!!!
💪💪💪💪😎😎😎😎
God I forgot how smooth his move set is
This is why Cody wins most of his matches. Feels awesome when he puts over talent like Black
perfect debut for black made him strong
RIck Flair AEW
AEW Sucks Aew Is Pissed Company A Trash There A Stupid Trash
I came too see Cody ain’t no retirement yet
Black is awesome!
Love black from India
He is over With the crowd
This squash felt different and unique and was a great way to introduce Malakai to AEW, couldn’t have been booked better!
Today wrestling is just more acting sometimes...
HOW WAS THIS GEM A FREE AGENT?!  Guy is the next TNT champion and more, heel and has the entire crowd chanting his name, i cant even remember the last time another singles wrestler had the crowd captivated like this. This guy's stuff is cranked to 11
Hopefully Cody being squash here lead to his redemption arc. Prolly turn heel and join The Elite, finally.
Don't beat black for a year
P.S. Your speakers are pus-sies.
Is too good to see the BLACK MASS again!!!!
Sweet sweet debut. Welcome to AEW Malakai Black.
Looks like the black house is tired of playing moderation, to me. And that definitely sounds more different to me, than it would to you. ;)
Damn right he did!
Malakai is not a wrestler, aew needs to resing
Great match and ending Malakai looked like a true force to be reckoned with! Considering how much Cody has done to make stars and put others over he deserves his pyro and place as one of the top guys in AEW he's done more for this company than any top star would in his position.
Blacks ring gear looked cheap
2:56 man that was smooothhhh what an absolute pro move from cody u know he sacrifice his body for this kind of stuff
Wow🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💥💥💥
Malakai Black vs Windham would be a mega dream match
Cody is the man, putting himself over for Malakai before taking his vacation, huge respect and props to him
This is the same Tommy End who Vince McMahon kept in a dark closet for months because he had nothing for him.
snore. (gimmes)
Que bien que malakai sea main event estoy contento y satisfecho .
that woooo before attempting the Figure-4 was teasing a little 4 Horsemen Reunion reunion at AEW down the line.
Yeah now black won.But after he wins TNT or world title cody maybe the guy who defeat black. Aew is the company which is builded for all 4 executive vice president😂.
That table has the strongest gravitational pull in all of wrestling!
Miro vs Black
2:00 That’s the most intense single leg crab I can recall seeing. Black making every single move matter, well done!
Lol, how many gimmes did Cody need to give(?)-- because, I see a few (Batman).
His eye makeup looks so fake now they need to keep it how it was when he debuted
All it takes is one Black Mass and you will FADE TO BLACK
que calidad de llaveo,velocidad y técnica por parte de Malakai!!
Cody = HHH? I think NOT.
Ngl, among the superstars who claims that they know Muaythai, Black is the one who look most legit.
AEW is just getting started and treating the wrestlers how they should be 😍Cody putting over young talents are great to see
Wow
We witnessed history tonight. Great things to come in AEW 💯
WHAT. A. DEBUT. 🤯🤯🤯🤯🔥🔥🔥
Black VS White
that was awesome!! that was aweomes!! that was awesome!!
Malakai is gonna have a great run in aew. Can't wait to see Daniel  Bryan, cm punk, and I know rumors of Adam cole coming since his contract is up after summerslam only signed to put over riley
This was the first time I saw Black wrestle and I wasn’t disappointed
did cody just lost clean to malakai black?!
Malakai ALMOST surely wrestles like there ain't no rules. How's that seat guy, nice and warm....(?)(.)
This is how you book strong debut match 🔥
The white horse has fallen, Holy shit is right! Wow
This is why my wendsday nights have meaning again!!!
JR. buddy. Friend. Can you maybe and I mean this respectfully. Retire?
Funny how this scripted bs is showing up in my feed. I quit watching when I was 16.   Which was 28yrs ago.  Just something about a bunch of dudes rolling around with one another in their underwear that doesn't work for me.  But obvious you all love that sausage party bs lol.
Cody Rhodes don't mind putting wrestlers over. He respect the business and wants AEW to have ready made stars that can move up when the current top guys leaves.
This muay thai kick boxing style he has looks so amazing and deadly and has amazing and incredible move set what amazing creativity
Just put the title on black already
Malakai's theme is fucking sick
Lol, Malakai seriously gauged Cody in the eye. (twat)
Malakai black=Undertaker  *The new Undertaker in AEW*
Good match
Fantastic, Brodie levels of squashing there. Just don’t have Cody come back in 30 days just to get the win back again, leave it as it is
I was maybe hoping this match would go a little longer, but maybe that was the point, it made me want more.  Also, it might be wiser to refer to Malakai's style as kickboxing, since that is what the dutch are known for, not just exclusively Muay Thai
Quick ass debut match Black kicked him off top through the table then the Black Mass pinned him with his foot DAMN.
I hope Cody Rhodes comes back all dark and is a force to be reckoned with.
Love you aew from algerain🇩🇿🇩🇿🇩🇿
Wow, This is wrestling.  Just wow, both men deserve a real bow.
Shades of Cody vs Brodie Lee with that ending. You love to see it.
The only knock for me in this otherwise perfect match is Black's downgrade in ring gear.
To be honest, I'd rather watch Black and Buddy Murphy go at it till the end of times than see cm punk in AEW. I mean come on, that man has no respect for fans and only cares about who throws more money at him
This is who CM Punk should beef with
Perfect debut match for Black, can't wait to see where his career will go in AEW.
AEW haters have to pull off some pretty elaborate mental gymnastics to say this company’s product isn’t on fire right now 🔥🔥🔥
Good✨Night🤟🌟🤟Sweet✨Dreams
Cody is a star maker
"Say it ain't so Cody. Say it ain't so."
Fans don't deserve cody
🔥🤘🏼💀🤘🏼🔥Black!💯
AEW IS BEST IN THE WORLD
What a fantastic debut! In his first match, Malakai is already a bigger star that he has ever been before.
Well, in my opinion it's not fair. You just make someone look so dominant in his first match. Cody should fight back too
white vs balck  this is the wrestling i was waiting  now its actually happening  thanks AEW
Has anybody sacrificed more for AEW and its talent than Cody Rhodes? Between his squash match loss to Brodie Lee, forfeiting his right to challenge for the AEW World Championship and then losing a one-sided match to Malakai Black where he was pinned with one foot. The man is a true martyr, and easily the most unselfish top star in wrestling.
Malakai Black looked so dominant after the match. What a great booking, AEW.
epic match, malakai black is really good
I’m still in shock Cody lost that fast
Welcome to the house of Black
For those say his gear looks bad. It's not bad but plain. Which isn't bad just kinda mediocre. Learn the difference. Lol
Malakai Black will be a huge star in AEW
I love how Cody isn't afraid of being squashed just to put over the newcomers in grand fashion
The crown is on 🔥🔥 🔥
Not since Mr. Brodie Lee has Cody been torn apart like that
That's how you build a star!!!! LETS GOOOOO
Malakai black vs Cody Rhodes match was awesome
When I saw we only had 10 minutes of show left, I knew it was going to be a squash.  Happy for Malakai Black. Also props to Cody for putting him over. I think Black might fued with Sting next.
What a perfect debut for Malakai Black first of all his entrance, the move, everything was perfect, second the promo after that it felt like Cody Rhodes was retired but I feel like it him taking a break for a while
Malakai Black is one of my favorite wrestlers in modern wrestling. He's so badass and could have a good match with anyone.
Can't wait if Malakai Black feud with Miro.
Black Army 🖤🖤🖤🖤
Black is like an anti Hero.. Wanna see him to dethrone Omega 🔥🔥
4:34 Sweet Dreams, Cody... 😴
Cody put him over like the way Cody can, confident but absolutely destroyed in the end. He did it with Brodie and he’s done it again, both times are wonderful.
End now black moves are awesome
Good to see Alister black 🖤
Malakai Black's presence  is so badass and the in ring work was so great he can ascend to the top here in AEW. That kick to Cody on the turnbuckle though... HOLY S!
Cm punk cm punk 🔥🔥🔥
Malakai   full match
"BuT CoRneTTe DaDDy ToLd mE CoDy DOesn'T PuT AnyoNe oVer"
3:03-3:05 DAMN!!! 😲
Black is just in his own world. His kicks are soo clean
F*ck These Youtube Titles
This is how Black should have been booked the whole time
Year ago late Brodie Lee squashed Cody just like this. Just awesome👏👏👏.  RIP BRODIE LEE!
Where's the retirement bit lol why show that on thumbnail but we can't watch it haha
just hear that crowd!!!!!!
Black mass 🔥
I thought Cody Rhodes was retiring at the end, lol. But he's not. I'd love to see a rematch between these 2.
It's the full match, WOW
Love the black and white contrast here.
Yes I'm first means I'm the best aew fan
My money is on Malakai to resurrect Adam Cole!
Great Debut match for Malakai, can't wait to see more!!🔥
2nd
