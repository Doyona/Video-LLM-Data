:( it all went poorly, so sad
Now only if the show was this good
xbox live bug fix when ? would like to play the fcking game here
Lollll
dude i fucking HOPE that we get something like this again in the next game, i fucking loved everything about this, spartans showing up and being depicted like this just makes them look so much more badass imo
Nah bro they were too slow
was that an i love bees reference at the beginning?
0:33 it's actually one of life's great mysteries
Anyone notice when the Spartans are walking with the soon-to-be-training-commander  the armor of the brown spartan carring the wounded one turns blue when they zoom into her necklace?
Anyone know the guitar part at 2:04? It sounds so good for an edit.
"Why are you here?!"  "TO DO WHATEVER YOU TELL ME TO DRILL SERGEANT!"
I genuinely hate the Spartan 4s these aren’t real Spartans they are glorified marines and odsts
im god
This makes no sense timeline wise

I'm pretty sure these are spartan 4s
HALO es precioso
Aren't brutes like excellent hunters by smell?
I’m here for teabag everyone on my way
This could've been so good man
2:10
Ah cut content. The team behind Infinte is now gone. Halo 7 will be made by a new team of devs working on their first halo together maybe even their first game. As it was with 4 and 5.  Zero growth as a company. Zero familiarity with the franchise. This is why 343 continue to fail.
Too bad these cinematics that were made for multiplayer cannot be accessed in game anymore.
We need her armor
kinda wish the story had time to be fleshed out and implemented
The Spartan IVs are in default mark 7 because they haven't saved up enough credits for other armour. They just managed enough for the armour coating.
So you're telling me that in 8 years a 16 year old teenager started to look like 40-50 years old?
1:20 I think that its Leon 011, Robert 025, August 099 and Naomi 010 ! Old members of the Beta Team of Red Team on Reach 😉😉
Go woke go broke pussies
If you noticed that their armor is more covered in this game than previous halo games. Halo 4-5 had less plating and had sleeker look as in halo infinite the armor is more bulky.
Hace cuántos años existía ya la versión de la mark VII?
#DEIkillsart
shivers 😂 1:52
DEI, ESG, CRS, CRT at launch and for awareness holidays but then they abandoned the development lol. Wild how misleading the marketing was. Scamming the fan to a new level.
The brute that first sees her isn’t even in game
Interesting that we can all look back and see how MS was trying to jump ahead of the Woke Agenda and came up with this Trash No Body Character for MP.    Which makes all the sense today, as a Purpose Agenda because we already had Sarah Plamer as a Femalw Spartan Lead.   But I guess Palmer wasnt Woke Enoufuh so they had to replace her with a Black Gay.   Most Black People arent even Gay so why is almost eveey black person in a Video Game a Homosexual?
Back when there was still some hope that the game would turn out to be good.
Shes literally a usless pandering character. Has no importance to the story and no contribution to the story. Why does she look like shes in pain when she asks "are you ready"? And she isnt even yelling at them. This is not only corny and useless...its cringe asf
Anyone notice the "Second Prelude" from Halo 2 ? I love this trailer.
Man, this game had so much potential.
This trailer is so damn good
Who is she? Nobody knows. Nobody cares. What's the bee mean? Nobody knows. Nobody cares. What's her contribution to the story? No contribution. If she was taken out of the story would it have any impact? No.  Oh so its just a diverse character for pandering. Cool?
Los que la rescataron eran Spartan lll?
i hope all halo games get remastered  for new xbox  and hope it gets cross play and Play Station 5 help it grow
God everything halo is so lame now a days. Is just feels so weak and pathetic. Idk how you can call that pussy bunch Spartans. “I cahnt hee you”.
WHY COULDNT WE GET MORE OF THIS IN THE CAMPAIGN & IN THE SHOW
Why does she have to be a gay, black lesbian? I mean do you genuinely think your player base is composed of people like this? Lmfao
DIVERSITY INCLUSION EQUITY GAY
"diversity" 🙄
I like overwatch
Arh hidden cheeks home town
2:11 sir yes sir is better
The most useless character addition to halo …
What a waste of time this entire story was, just for the damn company to end it abruptly.
😂😂😂 GAAAAAAY 😂😂😂
What.... Spartans were on Earth besides Chief?
I’d love a halo series or a movie animated like this rather than that garbage live action series
El trailer 😍😍😍😍😍😍 El juego 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
what emblem is that on the fireteam's armor?
Oh good grief with the DEI 🤣🤣🤣🤣  Give me a break lol
Multiplayer had some really good cutscenes for no reason. Sad they scrapped them now.
1:51 God damnit, that piano... :')
Hi
The spartan that offered help to Agryna is actually wholesome
should've just used the cinematic team to make the halo show
When the world seems dark, our shields will light their way and when the enemy marches forward, the flash of our muzzles will blind them
I like the one final effort music bit
PS5 is way better than this Garbage, Halo Died after Reach
Is that London? If so it’s cool how the only remain remnant of the city it once was is the Big Ben clock tower preserved as a historical landmark
While far from perfect, Halo Infinite is the closest to the true spirit of Halo we've had since Bungie's departure.
Great marketing. Terrible product.
I dont like how that spartan had an injured leg so Easily. Like that seemed kinda uneccsary
Imagine being a regular civilian in 2553 and become a Spartan Commander in 2560.
Just coming back and rewatching this in 2023 to see how far the game has come. There’s been improvements in-game but the cutscenes I’m not so sure of despite how cool it is to see OUR Spartan in those scenes.   Also, for this cutscenes, these have to be Spartan-IIIs. The timeframe (if it’s during the prolonged Battle of Earth during H2-H3) is too early to be Spartan-IVs, and well I don’t see the UNSC wasting the limited Spartan-IIs they have on recon sweeps/clears on Earth (even though there is little to no difference in terms of skill between the S-IIs and S-IIIs). I like to believe these Spartans are sent down into cities and urban areas to completely rid them off Covie forces.  As for the armour being Mk. VII, well there was GEN1 Mk. VII Mjolnir, but we only have known it to be given to Naomi-010, but it’s not crazy to think some Spartan-III operatives and teams who survived the Battles of the Epsilon Eridani System (the system Reach was part of) to get this armour too.  Either way love this cutscene, and if it’s Spartan-IIIs that just makes it better for me personally as I love Spartan-III lore!
bad game...
Some random person... lets hire her in the spartan program!!!!! this game is a joke 343 is a joke get them out of here
blah, these cinematics dont look that good. Was expecting much better
You stupid monkey.
Dear CJ Stevens, I am going to orbital drop you in public.
Imagine getting a Halo game, may not even be chief led, where we play as part of a spartan iv fire team, dropping in to a situation like this and it's our job to save as many as we can during the campaign. That shit would be fire!
I don't like her voice. They could have gotten someone else more official and serious!
#Wastedpotential
I like This cutscene but they’re wearing MK 7 and fighting covenant… who are wearing banished gear which isn’t that big of an issue but still it just confuses me
10 years of cringe and counting. Ty 343i
Once again… 343 makes an ad that has absolutely nothing to do with the game play… THERE ISNT EVEN A CITY IN INFINITE 😂😂😂🥴🥴🥴
is this the girl from the H3 ODST voice logs
Easily one of the most cold-blooded, badass cutscenes in Halo imo
The dehydrated kid became a dehydrated uninspiring c.o.
"Nobody were concern why they were originally built" - Dr Catherine Halsey
2:06 best part 😏😏😏😏
i think people forget spartans aren’t just mindless covenant killing machines; they’re protectors and that little nod says so much
Spartans 4 are strong.No matter what people say about them.
This is so dumb
man i wish there was a game mode like this trailer as a sort of firefight
So by the color of the Phantom dropships here, it seems like this was potentially an occupation of London during the Human Covenant war (which would make sense in timeline since Agryna looks a lot younger in the flashback, and likely spent the next decade or so breaking into the scene herself to become a Spartan).  With that being said.... shouldn't those brutes be wielding classic Brute Plasma Rifles and not the new Pulse Carbines?
I’m gonna be completely honest I really don’t like the new main multiplayer protagonist. She’s better than Palmer for sure, but that speech she gave wasn’t great, she doesn’t sound like a leader and honestly I just think it was a step in the wrong direction. I think they should’ve gone with a character who’s been in the game before, such as Buck, or Locke. I think 343 is trying to be “empowering” to women considering every multiplayer protagonist has been a female, first Palmer now this lady, and I think it’s a step in the wrong direction. I think we should stick to the core of halo.
the core gameplay is super awesome, the only thing wrong with the game is the lack of content after a full year which is unacceptable.
What generation of Spartans are portrayed? Are they S3?
This game had so much Potential.
Why isn’t this campaign!? This is some holy grail halo stuff. Dropping into that dense city environment would be insane to play through. I mean the drop pods with a Spartan team are just unreal
Since this takes place in 2552 this was before Spartan IV's, does this mean she was saved by Spartan III's? There's too few Spartan II's to have been spared for London and most would have been probably sent on more important missions
THIS IS WHAT INFINITE NEED MORE OF!  This is way better cutscene than the ones we've been getting for season 2. It's so much more atmospheric and thematic. The ones in season 2 are kind of dry and the faces look uncanny AF
Wish the narrative events had stuff like this
Still the best cinematic of infinite.  Edit: Wow I came back to see the old comments before the game was launched... and I can say people was so fukin hyped for this game. Damn this is a disaster...9 months later
Can we get more military oriented Halo? I sometimes dont feel like the super weapon of the UNSC but more like Doom guy.
All I see is a nearly shot for shot remake of the Overwatch cinematic trailer where they fight for the glove LOL
“Yes, ma’am” 😆
Kinda wish the Halo tv show was about this commander and chief would just show up at the end of the show
It would've been better if it was some non British guy than a 🤢 British black girl who's bald 🤮
So the Mark 7 already existed in that time :v
Can't wait for odst
1:25 dafuq. Why can’t my shields recharge that fast?
I love this cinematic
Big Ben looks so out of place lol
yaestoi bie loquetas asiedo krytal en mucieño tiene ame jemelo como mismo nobre queyo emiliano dejadese yo queyoago en misueño traidora
Superposition. I'AM only 4 people I'AM Vi in REGENCY.
Timeline shit I guess.
Vic Fuentes was here too.
I was in the band literally in the black and white photo. Submitted music. Those other people are crazy.
And my sibling of Crown the Empire band.
Bill Joe, and Mike Shenoda visited.
A Clone. They dropped off my guitar, but they tried to theft it. The RhoadS.
My Daughter was raped also and now a Matt Tuck imposter is here again.
Vayne Solidor was here also...
Their raping in my area again. The Final Fantasy people.
I’ve played Halo since the very beginning, yet it’s always wild seeing how massive a Spartan is compared to the average human. 🔥🔥🔥🔥
I’m glad they handled the Spartans MUCH better in this game compared to 4 and 5. THIS is how Spartans should be
I was Black Squad from Black Ops. They never showed up.
Left to Survive game now there are zombies again.
I'AM on Star Trek Task, Star Fox Task, and Halo Infinite.
I know Halo infinite.
Stop running at my home wearing MP uniforms. After the first 3 instances your retarded. I have toandatory kill all yellow shirt UNSC. We are USA.
thats ins't the banished they not use red colors earth that is the battle of earth in late part of the conflict so in the time in the traile we still have UNSC Infinity and UNSC still have only 3 frigates in earth  and the unsc was about to win the human covenant war
It’s crazy how ironically the Covenant was probably the best thing to happen to the Spartans. Thanks to them, Spartans are idolized as heroes instead of being the oppressive boogeymen they were designed as. It would be like if during the original Star Wars trilogy the Yuuzhan Vong decided to attack and start wasting both Rebels and Imperials, and Darth Vader was the only one with the power to stand against them, how much the public’s attitude toward Vader would’ve changed as a result.
She might be Sargent Johnson’s daughter
Watching this again months after the release still gives me chills!
Spartan Instructor: Why are you here?  Me: It's one of life's great mysteries isn't it? Why are we here? I mean, are we the product of some cosmic coincidence, or is there really a God watching everything? You know, with a plan for us and stuff. I don't know, man, but it keeps me up at night. Spartan Instructor: WTH? I meant why are you right here right now!  Me: oh.
This is how the show should have started.
Gayyyyyy
cringe
Watched many times cant stop the feeling  coming from  this
Overwatch 3 looking good.
This intro is so amazing...
Where halo? All I see is woke bullshit
After watching first episode of halo series needed to watch this cinematic to make myself feel better about halo
Now look at the state of halo infinite.  Games dead because of 343s incompetence and negligence
god what a fkn let down
343i,please just release season 2 cinematic already!
thats how you introduce a badass women character
Was London attacked during the events of halo 3?
I wish we could have a halo movie animated like this
I’m not sure why, maybe it’s because a lot of us have been here since the beginning, games, books, shows, etc and it got on an emotional level. But seeing videos like this where you see the other side of the war (civilians) and why they dedicate themselves to want to do good as well, is so beautiful it brings tears to my eyes. Possibly the best saga in the entirety of the universe.
Yet we have multiplayer and it's a fraction of what everyone thought it was going to be. :(
Brutes: **Gets alerted to Agryna’s presence** British Cop when seeing Brutes brandish weapons publicly: “OI! I HOPE YOU HAVE A LICENSE TO USE THAT!” Brutes: “What are you going to do? Spank me with your primitive hit stic-“ British Cop: **Yeets Brute into next year with the baton’s internal field generator**         I also admire the fact that the Covenant, including the Brutes have the decency to not destroy any famous landmarks on Earth.
That was the slowest drop pod impact ever. Also I like to think @1:36 that the blue spartan selfishly kicks the shock grenade toward his team mates, injuring one (causing them to limp) As he stands there looking proud of himself. Seems in character for a spartan iv lol
0:34 "Why are you here?" "That's one of life's great mysteries, isn't it? Why _are_ we here?"
what is a Spartan? A Spartan is a symbol. Hope were there is none! in time of darkness... we are hope together we are unstoppable. a gothic person said to himself why be the drone when i could be the queen king lesbian ruler
John 1:17 English Standard Version 17 For jthe law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ(priest kings).
Holy crap 343 is giving me bungie level feels
I really hate the multiplayer music theme
1:51 childhood memory unlocked.
0:04 is that the clock tower of buckingham palace? by the way great trailer and the spartans even the spartan II have always been so human as to show the delicacy and empathy shown by the spartan in the video. So stop fuc)(/&ing around.
1:56 she is next to a bunch of shaqs.
Commander Agryna is super annoying, the time period of this cutscene is ambiguous and makes no canonical sense based on the mishmash armors and vehicles present, and that annoying pep-talk speech comes off less like something you’d hear at a spartan training facility and more like something you’d hear at a children’s summer camp.
Damn, London is highly advanced
0:46 omg the Halo soundtrack sounds so good I wish this played all through Halo infinite
those are all wear mark vii  helmet-
Is this cutscene supposed to take place during new Mombasa? It’s really well done and stuff but being an absolute moron I crave to know?!
I wonder if those are Spartan twos or threes
No ur not hope, spartan 2s n 3s ar
Yo halo make more trailers like this, this was so cool
Don't cry, don't cry...(😭)
Would have preferred jun but this is still good
What's the name of that commander in the last scene the black woman??
Why does she look like she has pink eye? Does she not wipe when she poops?
Theses Spartan armours are 👌👌
Can I just say this! I get shivers up my spine every time I see a spartan come on the battle field, and this scene just made me wish I could become one😅.  Words can't describe the respect I have for chief and the other spartans ✊❤
Why are Spartan 4's in London?
This is what spartan IVs should have been in halo 4
Agryna really changed what it means to be a Spartan.   ... Heros, rather than political assassins.
I like the trailer but there is no story carried through the multiplayer in the actual game.
She definitely dead. Cortana blew up the Spartan training station.
Is that clock tower Big Ben ??? Is this London 😳??
I liked this new spartan character, everything about halo infinite is beautiful, you can tell alot of love went into this game💜
343 PLEASE do not allow The Endless to be designed like the Harbinger. Her design is super unremarkable. The Endless should look ICONIC. PLEEASE
Coming back to this trailer after beating the campaign… RIP
I was playing Halo 3 ODST again... So is she Sadie Endesha?
go straight to Games Workshop with this animation and give them hope where is none...
Which Spartans were these? Definitely not II’s
When's her backstory supposed to be set? During the Banished occupation or Covenant occupation?   If it's set during the Covenant period I didn't know they occupied London; weren't they only focused in Africa + Spartan-IVs were only experimental at that stage i.e. they wouldn't even send them out to fight   But if it's set during the Banished occupation (post-Created uprising) then wouldn't the commander be too young/inexperienced to be a commander by 2560? Unless the multiplayer is set years after 2560
"It's one of life's great mysteries isn't it? Why are we here? I mean, are we the product of some cosmic coincidence, or is there really a God watching everything? You know, with a plan for us and stuff. I don't know, man, but it keeps me up at night."
Is this Sadie?
I like how spartan use his body to protect civilian
Anyone know the theme at 0:05
am i the only one thinking this looks like sadie from halo ODST recordings?
Seeing the spartans in this trailer feeling like theyre badasses, titanic and unstoppable. Bring in a Spartan II, everything changes.
🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂
Halo Infinite!! Look!! Sooo!! Cool!! 😎
A Spartan isn't just about being a badass, it's about making a choice and doing what others can't for the sake of everyone else.   Palmer didn't get the memo.
that spartan
to be honest I think this was the covenant and not the banished but I could be wrong
Fun fact: the Spartans in this cinematic sport the “hero” visor.
Imagine you could pick what Spartan generation you are.
Looks like she encountered a Spartan-III as a child which is kinda rare since most of them were sent in large suicide ops in hundreds
Get woke...go broke.
Palmer should have stuck to being FemShep tbh
After seeing today’s prices for some of the cosmetics in the halo infinite shop. I have decided to only play MCC for multiplayer. However, I can’t wait for the campaign! Please no more paywall surprises 343. You guys have me feeling like there will be something in the campaign that’s going to force players to pay in order to proceed in it. You told us on day one we would have millions of customization options. We did not. At least 80% is locked behind a ridiculous paywall. I really hope by ‘day one’ you guys meant December 8. Because as it stands. Now, we are not even close to having that many free options.
I wish they had different commanders you could choose to follow. Kind of like picking the AI, I would love to see a Sgt. Johnson-ish commander instead of Agryna and Palmer.  I cannot stand this chick in the background of weapon drills every time I mess up and I hear "Jun himself would be proud". At least Palmer would say exactly what I'm telling myself "That sucked run it again."
I wonder if her symbol was an updated version of the Manchester bee.  Perhaps she was visiting London or was now living there upon leaving Manchester.
1:20 thanks David
More lore inaccuracies in two minutes than the entire halo series
1:28 Just incredible, i got chills. Just like Rookie, we will never forget you. The best protagonist in all halo games. Rookie, halo 3 odst, the type of a silence and stronger soldier.
less race swapped forced black folks plz jesus
Sometimes you forget just how goddamn MASSIVE Spartans are.
That second Spartan who came out firing! I don’t know why but that was so badass
Halo Infinite's Atriox. ? Boss laatst. ??????
Oh wait the game is free. Lmfao how to rip off more more ppl
Why they making us pay for everything that was free in the last halo ?
"Why are we here?"  It's one of life's greatest mysteries.
Am I the only one who thought this was Sadie from ODST?
I hope the halo series is like this
Anyone know which song is played here?
She's more of an interesting character than Spartan Locke
FPS Fanbase: Betrayed by BF2042 and CoD Vanguard Halo Infinite: 1:51
When she said, "Why are you here?" I was praying for someone to go "Well that's one of life's great questions, isn't it?"
You just broke the lore again. Not surprising though, seeing as how this was outsourced.
rocking the I love bees embelem
1:22 in multi-player you would already be one shot after that lol
She is the girl from Halo 3 ODST recordings…
This brought more chills then 2042 did
I miss Johnson.
was it London or am I going crazy?
It would be great if they made a halo movie, ender style or guardians of the galaxy style, I would not miss that!
they should’ve spent less time on that cutscene and more time on the progression system
Many people think this is the Battle of Earth, but this is just normal England after our 90th football loss that week
OMG what song is playing!
Their are four types of people accepted into the spartan 4 program each with their own distinct traits and personalities - Personalities similar to our own. 1. The prodigy: These are individuals who are naturally gifted in a certain field that enables them to advance faster than most before becoming spartans - Think Olympia Vale. 2. The leader: These individuals are gifted in the art of combat tactics and situational analysis, they can easily adapt to any given situation, enabling them to lead their allies to victory- Think Edward Buck, Gabriel Thorn, and Jameson Lock. 3. The Specialist: These are individuals who possess an exceptional level of skill  in their respective fields - Think Naya Rey (Signal intelligence) and Holly Tenaka (Engineering). 4. The battle harden warrior: These are individuals who have proven themselves capable of going toe to toe with foes more powerful than themselves single handedly- Think Sarah Palmer (who killed a brute chieftain by herself) or Frank Kodiak (Who killed a sword wielding elite during the covenant war)
The Multiplayer Beta is out, and looks, feels and performes like shit... This is not the real game is it?
Love that the commander has the logo from the Halo 2 I Love Bees ARG
Okay, but why is it Mk VII armor wearing Spartans helping her? If Mk VII was available, why did they give Chief Mk VI just days before this? Are those early generation, experimental Spartan IV's?  Why didn't the brutes smell her?  Outside of those issues I have, it's a badass trailer.
This was so well done and amazing. Love it. ❤
Well talking about spartan ring side seat
Happy they made an SIV Leader that we dont feel obligated to follow. I actually feel like I want to be lead by her. Palmer was more of a hothead teammate than the SIV Commander.   However, I'd hate to find out she got the off screen assassination treatment, rather I'd like to see an evolution of her character after her being more battle hardened from the events of H4-5 and now Infinite
Don't let this awesome multiplayer trailer distract you from the fact that 343i now uses the classic monk chant (0:49) for any time they want to get a nostalgic emotional response out of the audience when in Halo CE, 2, 3, ODST, Reach, and 4 it was only reserved for when a Halo ring was in view. And as you can imagine there was no Halo rings in Reach and ODST so it was not present in those games.   They also use Cortana's theme at 1:50 for a similar effect despite Cortana not being present at all.
1:50 NAME OF SONG?
why cant Halo infinite credits be earned, they should really be given to you upon completing challenges. For example 10 for basic (completing a game), 20 common (winning a game, x kills), 50 uncommon (ctf, weapon based), 100 heroic (specialist achievements, milestone), 200 legendary (big milestones), and 500 for mythic (massive milestones). Or maybe 1 credit for every 10xp for each challenge. Just some ideas really to encourage people to play around the game. I dont like being forced to pay money for something I used to get for free. I get having some sort of monetization because the game itself is free but we should still be able to have a lot of armors for FREE. Or pay 60 dollars for the game and get it all.
cultural appropriation
I dont like blacks appearing in White games/movies
The Spartan using his bodyshield to protect the civilian is just absolutely badass
in times of darkness... WE ARE HOPE
Love the music
When guys from big team battles gets pulled into the campaign 😂
A cinematic intro for the multiplayer? The hell have I missed?
Loved this intro it's really good, too bad we didn't see the Spartans mess up the brutes like back in Wars.
That's all cool and all but why does she look like a man?
damn halo really had to go full woke on this one, as a black man I don't want to be watched by a strong black woke womans, can you guys cut the crap pretty please, its very divisive. hell next they are going to say that she trained master chief himself, give me a break with this nonsense.
This is what we want.
That was awesome.
Dun, dun dun, dun..dun dun...... You know the song 😉 chills. Halo feels like it's back
Where were any of these spartans during Halo 2/3/ODST?
"Feet first to hell?"  "Feet first to hell."
0:41 Are they on reach??? Those mountains in the background look awfully familiar to the ones we saw in the epilogue cutscene in halo reach.
Did you guys see her little hand inside that Spartans Giant bear paw
estoy enamorá de este video.
I thought she was sadie
It is really starting to look like a spartan bargain sale. Anyone can be one. Plus they do like giving females a commander position huh
I love how every building in London has turned Big Ben into Little Ben
I love how they paint the Spartans as these godlike saviors that normal people idealize. But at the same time show that Spartans can get wounded and sometimes need to be helped by their team. I like the idea of Spartans being the peak of humanity both in physical strength but being good people that want to protect the ones who can’t protect themselves.  You can interpret and gain all of this in a 2 minute trailer from Spartans that never even say anything. Peak characterization.
Someone needs to convince me that this is not Sadie from Halo 3 ODST
Man can someone stop cutting the onions?
Halo beginning to reclaim it's identity It's enough to make a grown man cry
I’m soooooo ready
I hate how some people hate the nod the Spartan gives on "it's informal and they would never waste the time" Halo 5 had the most by-the-books military style dialogue and acting and that was so boring. It's nice to see some character in Spartans, even from something as small as a nod
I’m really hoping that was Sadie bringing her back as a Spartan would be awesome if actually cry
That was the weakest "I can't hear you". Cringe.
Is that Sadie?
They gave great significance to the Spartans to the human race... It's beautiful
Idk why I thought the multi-player was coming out November 15th for free and the campaign you buy on December 8th
Water on my cooling
VERY NICE
Man this trailer GOT ME HYPED. MA'AM YES MA'AM!!!
CG characters have that weird uncanny thing where it doesn't look like they're touching the thing they're holding, like their hand's hovering over it.
Pretty sure that the multiplayer takes place years after the campaign.
I know their inserting blacks into this for politics etc but why make her a complete liability and getting in the way tripping over everything she can?
Bruh it took me like 2 minutes after watching this to realize the woman who was talking is the same one with the orange hoodie
December 8. Candidates, are you ready?!?! Me: Ma’am yes ma’am!!
WE WUZ
Tryes to escape brutes and get almost killed by UNSC drop pods. Life must be hard as civilian xD
Did i miss anything or when did brutes invade London?
This cinematic makes no sense.   The flashback setting is clearly on earth during halo 2/3. The brutes fly Banished-design banshees. Spartan 4's are dropping out of ODST droppods. Anyone else seeing the issue here?
"Together...Together we are unstoppable!"  Perfect line if they ever introduce Playable Elites...
That makes me wonder is the ODST drop pods the same as the ones used by Spartans? If so wouldn't that mean that the drop pods were designed a bit too big? Or do yall think it was done so intentionally, thinking that in the future soldiers would be larger?
Ba. Please I'm crying.
cool trailer ig but that voice acting was kinda cringe bro
These wanna be spartans from the spartan 4 program
I love bees.
Awesome!!
Gave me an idea. Would be cool if they made a game where the enemy consisted of only Ai's that made beating the game extremely difficult because of how intelligently they maneuver. And in order to even unlock the campaign, you have to first reach a certain level in multiplayer that proves you potentially have what it takes to beat the actual game.
The only way to get me to play multiplayer in this game is if you can be as an Alien even customizing the elite as well
Am i the only one who got chills when she touched her chain and the rock music dropped…?  This shit is gonna be sick dude.
Season 1: Heroes of Reach  change my mind
Humanity first.
Imagine if this was on legendary mode. That shit would of been bad.
what's the Big Ben doing in the background at the start of the cinematic?
Independent black woman cringe
Why cant they ever put equipment attached to the Mjolnir? Wheres the ammo pouches, the grenade pouches, IFAKS, the assault packs, etc. Its so damn lazy that they dont render the armor with all that on it.

Where is white people in games now?
I like her!
Our UK voices just don't have the gravitas for these kind of speech trailers. It just sounds weak.
Ok how did you get into military, let alone become a spartan, if you have hearing problem?
Can we get Steve Blum (Tom from Tunami)? He has a Spartan like voice
Disliked for misrepresenting the spartans. Did anyone ever read the source material? You guys have lost it so hard.
I don't even know who this spartan is in the cutscene, but I already love her.
It’s Sadie from Sadie’s story
damn  knowing that the girl is Actually The Spartan Trainer is really  Convincing
Those ODST pods would be dropping in so much faster than they show
Quick question for the modern woman in the comment section, I’ve seen alot of movies and tv show’s recently portraying women as wanting to be warriors fighting for their lives in video games now too like how they erased the saints from saints row for women and effeminate men and even our army recruitment was geared towards women and lgbt. So my question is there alot of you women who aspire to go to war? Im confused where all this is coming from?
let me guess they will milk cow the PvP with battlepass and skins over next 10 years so they don't hav to make another single player halo game lmao
this just puts a big smile on my face
Oh ya the woke trailer lol- it’s what the halo community is all about Hahaah
I can’t tell if it’s intentional or not, but I like the detail of her facial bone structure changing from civilian to Spartan. When she’s a civilian, her face is slimmer and smaller. When she’s a Spartan, her face is more round and denser looking. This is presumably due to the physical augmentations she went through to become a Spartan. If anyone knows anything about steroids, you would know that taking preforming-enhancing drugs will change the shape and bone structure of your face.
Beautiful 💜💜

AYO  *smacks lips*  SO YOU BE SAYIN   *puts on halo armor*  WE SOME KINDA SPARTANS?!??!
Why is it always black ppl that represent ethnic groups. Where are the Indians, Asians in gaming??
All the lore breaks aside this is pretty cool ngl.
This is my opinion. I saw it more like Firefight. 4 Spartans dropping in to secure an area of Covenant Brutes. We also saw Phantoms roaming around too. I would like Infinite to have a Firefight mode like Reach and ODST.
Cool how the civilian became inspired to become a Spartan.
Ok
So people are complaining about the fact that the brutes here are using pulse carbines, forgetting that just because weapons like the spiker weren't in Halo CE and 2, doesn't mean they didn't exist in the universe.    Yes I know it's in Reach.
Cringe
modern games suck, too much woke, forced diversity shit and child friendly disney cartoon like feel. absolute trash.
Someone else commented this so I can’t take credit but I like how we see an injured spartan at the end. It shows that our enemies aren’t to be taken lightly.
stop adding new characters bruh just stick to chief ur ruining the lore
This intro bring me question about chronologie
Wart wart wartort
Love this trailer.
That's pretty inaccurate, any brute would've said "that stench, I've smelled it before" and found her very quickly.
I don't know who this girl is, but I gotta say she does a better inspirational speech than Palmer did in Spartan Ops..
The second we got the close-up I knew that bee was gonna be on a suit of armor.  What a trailer though!  Hope we get these every season
what does this have to do with halo
That's the quickest shield recharge I've seen
1:24  they cover her back with behind shield like a terminator 2
"why are you here"?  "its one of lifes great mysteries isnt it, why ARE we here?, i mean are we a product of some cosmic coincidence, or is there really a god watching everything?, y'know with a plan for us, and stuff, i dont know ma'am but it keeps me up at night"
awful, i hate this lady more than spartan Locke
2.1k are bots
Her voice doesn’t match her lines. I’ve never heard “I can’t hear you” sound so weak in my life.

Hearing that little Halo 3 Piano bit gave me shivers...
We need Church As an a.i
Dura 2 minutos con 41 segundos pero se sintió mejor que toda la campaña de Halo 5 jsjsjsjjs
I hate the idea how anyone could be a Spartan. It's like anyone can receive the Super Soldier Serum and they too can beat the shit out of Master Chief without having to go through brutal military training as a child with decades of experience at war.
"WHY ARE YOU HERE?" Me:to play Halo infinite
We wuz spartanzz n shieeeeeet.
1:20 when my little brother is getting picked on
We will be seeing Chips Dubbo again, chips never dies ;)
SADIE?
Did the covenant land in London?  Regret brought one ship 🚢 into atmosphere.  Truth committed “all of his forces here” and started digging.  So……? Breaking canon for a trailer?
the halo 2 opening theme at the beginning tho oml
Perfecto.
I can keep watching this trailer and not be bored. I’m so impatient for when the game launches!
This trailer is a good representation of how Halo ages in generations.  The first generation is now the one educating new generations
Anyone else notice a lot of the music at the very start and trailer in general is very reminiscent of Halo 2 when they show High Charity in cut scenes
Like a good neighbor, Spartan is there 1:15
Meanwhile ODST HQ: Abandon all hope ye who enter here you worthless excuse of troops *Drops them to certain death in a metal box*
Great trailer but terrible voice acting
I like to think shes Sadie from Halo 3: ODST
Feels like this character is just a stand in for Palmer, not really complaining since most people didn't like Palmer but I'd bet she was replaced for a cheaper voice actor.
STOP MESSING WITH THE HALO LORE! 343 Please stop outsourcing cinematics to 3rd Parties. They don't know what there doing. Wrong spartan armor!
Hopefully it's explained exactly when the original covenant occupied London? during a time when there were multiple Spartans around?
Is that the girl in those recordings in New Mombasa in ODST?
Wtfruk is that black girl doing in that friking bridge ??
Is that Sadie from the Halo ODST logs?
Where master chief at
I bet these new Spartans are called Spartan V's
It looks amazing how they introduce the lore of her, just unpriceless
she asks: why are we her?  me: to finish this fight
What Gen Spartans are these? I know they are definitely not 2's are there 3 or 4s? Also what were the aliens? I'm recently starting to get interested in Halo so pls don't hate me if I get things wrong.
Played the beta and love it. I am only cofused by some instant jump melee IKs. But I am new to Halo.  I wonder how many COD players will switch , because I cant help it, but Halo Infinite is the game they want. They want action no camp game where aim is major skill to have. COD has way faster TTK has bullshit like recoil ADS etc which in my book essentially kicks it out of arena shooter genre which many claim it is. I like COD of course, but Halo Infinite is Unreal Tournament era for me. It just plays and feels really good.  Cant wait for the release :)
The starting of this cinematic gave me destiny 2 red war vibes.  Actually I feel like halo infinite will have seasonal campaigns like destiny has.
I hope that there will be a thing like spartan ops but way more better!
Spartans are the defenders of humanity….weren’t they created to crush human rebellions?
Show de bola 😃👍🏻🇧🇷😃😃😃😃🇧🇷🇺🇲🤜🏼🤛🏼
Why does the trailer for a game made for a male audience have a black female protagonist? It's like they want to alienate their audience.
I actually cried at this trailer when the Spartan reached their hand out for the girl. Liek, god damn that was amazing
This is like the US military recruitment video but actually good.
I'm just happy to see diversity in these games now all these games include all kinds of faces and that's very good to see
This is why the IVs are shit. Wouldn't have been able to do a tenth of what the IIs pulled off
I did not like that they put an injured Spartan, if they only fought with a few Bruts, once a single Spartan destroyed an army (Spartans 2)
I’m hyped but I’m also irrationally mad that they got the Time period wrong for the flashback😑. They didn’t look like that in halo 3!
When will the soundtrack from this trailer be released?
lol so the multiplayer has a story? I hope it's not a working together thing. That's not why we use the internet.
How do we expected to survive when we got clumsy kids like that...
Seeing those Halo 2 ODST pods are so nostalgic, I fell in love all over again
Talk about nostalgia. THESE are the trailers we remember as kids. We were all the lady at one point. 😭
anya de jo volt
John 117 is transgendered
Second guy came in a lil hot and ended up being injured 😄
Soyjak: WOMAN POC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I can't wait 🤯🤯🤯🤯
Too Good to even be Real!👏👏
Looks like halo infinite is getting the Disney star wars treatment
i'm not crying you are crying!
When is this piece of ahit game going to actually come out? Did they push it back another year?
Best army ad I’ve ever seen
To be a Spartan! 🔥🔥🔥
I dont get the hype this trailer has at all.
not a fan of the mandatory lesbian, black female woke nonsense.
i like how the first spartan never takes his eyes off the enemy, even as he nods to the future commander
Thought it was Sadie at first
Looking back on this I just realized that it makes no sense that Spartan IV's saved her when they weren't even a thing yet.
Absolutely Incredible Trailer. Couldn't have been better in my London opinion!!
Would’ve been real awkward if the pod had landed on her
Here we go with the identity politics rearing it's ugly head. Killed 3 birds with one stone. Woman in charge, obviously gay, looks like a dude. When you go that far to make her look like a man, you might as well make it a man.   Thank God for Retro.
Her necklace and icon a I love bees reference
THANK GOD FOR THE DIVERSITY AND WOMEN REPRESENTATION, JUST WHAT HALO WAS MISSING THANK YOU!
I kinda wish the Spartans they used were Fred, Kelly and Linda as they were around during the Invasion of Earth.
how did she get taller shes probably a spartan 4
Is that Carter before he became known for his skill nd leadership in his first s3 gen Nobel training?
"Our duty as soldiers is to protect humanity. Whatever the cost." - Master Chief
Acesta va fi un portent acest joc
"Season 1" = code for microtransactions galore
The Spartan reaching out his hand to help the civilian and the quick piano made me oddly emotional. Like, this is what being a Spartan is all about. Helping people and saving people.
Is this real time?
Is that supposed to be Big Ben in the background, is this in London?
For a sec. I think she was the girl in the odst audios...
Lo ví ebrio y llore
Beautiful trailer loved the remix of sacred iron suite as well as the halo 3 piano stunning!
Yuk, minorities...
1:51 I started crying 😭
Is Noone curious as to why her bag was so important?
Porá me arrepiei todo Tá muito interessante
Spartan 3 on Halo 3
For A Xeno Brutes they have poor peripheral vision
I swear these cunts are responsible for dying light 2 being delayed into 2022
Imaging she got hit by the drop pod door
I remember joining Xbox 11 years ago. Halo was one of my first games. Proud to be with Microsoft. This will be a day 1 purchase for me. My favourite Halo so far would have to be Halo 4.
any one notice big ben just sitting there
Honestly the brutes look appalling, I do not know why it costs them as much make them look like in halo 3 odst .
I have to be 18 to test flight :<
Oh man, even though I hate shooters, Halo was the only shooters game I looked up to, and it just never failed! When will we know how much it costs tho?
Man growing up I wish I was motivated but no had to get abducted just to become hope.smh🙃
Injured spartan IV: *Exists* Jerome in Halo Wars 2 killing four elites and a horde of brutes by himself: *"P a t h e t i c"*
Lol, the big ben is tiny compared to those other buildings.
Average Londoner
That phantom isn't going backwards like portrayed in the games :(    I'm kidding.
odst vibes right now im gonna cry i love this
Jugar Halo en una Pc usando control de xBox???? Hereje, a la hoguera!!!!
So who are the Spartans that drop during the trailer?  I don't recall any Spartan deployments to London during the Battle of Earth
Cool trailer, but why is there the newer armor and phantom in a trailer that is supposed to take place during the events of Halo 3. Stick to the canon please.
This game really wants me to get a Series X but I cant find one in stock
I’ve probably have watch the trailer over 100 times and each time gives me chills like it was the first
I hope that if we get to drop in the ODST drop pods, and that if we do said drop in this scenery, that it at least has some kind of ODST feel; lighting, rain, ambience, neon glow etc.
Probably some of the weakest generic spartans we will get to prolong the fight instead of finishing it.
halo 5 was terrible and had a better multiplayer trailer then this
Banished invasion of Earth? Campaign is going to be sick nasty.
Hire FatRatLolololol to make multiplayer gameplay footage for a multiplayer trailer  for Halo Infinite . He is serious top tier Halo talent when it comes to multiplayer combat and it would help promote more sales for Infinite  seeing a player absolutely shred in a multiplayer gameplay trailer. You should seriously consider hiring him for this before launch. If you are not convinced, just check out his content for yourselves and you will.  You will be completely blown away by some of the plays he pulls off.
This was a wonderful commercial!  It was refreshing to hear Ma'am, Yes Ma'am for once.
This trailer is wack af.
I want the music... Especially the track towards the end. Could anyone help me out? Track @ 1:57
Halo Halo es mi infancia me acuerdo cuando sólo r era un niño jugando halo 1 :')
You can see big ben at the start implying that this is London   So London is still a shit hole in the future
ODST GANG
Awesome 😬 👌 🆒️ 🙌
So... are you ready Spartan?
To those of you intelligent enough to know not to trust 343 and are not zombies who preorder from untrustworthy companies thank you. You're the ones who keep online console gaming from becoming one giant fortnite server.
This shit gave me chills😧💀🖤🤍💯
Can someone explain to me why these Spartan 4's are fighting during the initial Covenant invasions, they were in service even though Master Chief was a Spartan 2?
I love how when the first Spartan appears and they nod, like "Don't worry, I got you". Great trailer!
For the record, in the Marines, you say _Aye Aye Ma'm!_ ... not _'yes mam.'_  The Marines are part of the Navy, not the Army. In former versions of Halo, the vernacular has been Naval, such as Portside and Starboard. Sorry to split hairs .... Marines also dont do 'Sir sandwiches' like they just did when they said "Ma'm, yes m'am" ....  Might seem like an inconsequential particular but for anyone whose actually played these games and also served in the USMC or NAVY, its somewhat silly.
So excited. Go for Infinite!
Zzz
Stop making halo Infinite Woke! we want genders, not Body Type 1 and 2, and we don't want gender neutral armor! stop politicizing Halo!
was it just me who started to tear up at how epic this trailer is?
I absolutely love this sudden shift in perspective. To see what it's like to be the defenseless person. It's astounding.
We've had a small amount of "woke" stuff in Halo's past, but this is not it. This is 343 making some Bungie-level trailers!
what is the song that plays at the beginning of the trailer
completely innocent civilian to spartan commander, thats how you put a woman into power, take notes disney!
Is no one going to talk about the lore breaks?
its so god damn annoying
its rated T. 5 was rated T. Not a good sign
If the civilian is Sadie, it will be cool
Yay
DUDE I'M GRINNING LIKE AN IDIOT!!! THAT'S AWESOME!!
This trailer was so good it gave me goosebumps
Cool, but, when is the campaign story gonna get a trailer?
Hope that pod drop is gonna be how start big team battle matches, would be a sick intro
Lol Spartans we're not originally made for hope. They were made to bring the colonies to heal.
Mark 6 armor was not Invented yet also there's no sparten I Vs in 20552  it was'nt in till 6 to 26 months after the events of halo 3 they were first created
Should’ve scared up her face. Honestly when they show characters that are supposedly battle hardened, scars add to character development.
What if that girl is actually the girl from the audio terminals in Halo 3 Odst. I also believe those soldiers are spartan III because of the time skip to her also being a spartan.
rated T? I'm out
This game looks worse with every new video... Im really losing hope.
If only a live-action movie were made similar to this.
Just realised the first Spartan appears at 1:17
That black woman is better than Master Chief
plz add Halo 5 online its time
343 TE AMO
The beginning music and all throughout the trailer! godlike!
Arbiter: “Season?” Master Chief: “We don’t do that here.”  I severely hope this doesn’t hinder Halo. So few games actually somewhat succeed in “Season” loops. But, the track record for Halo has been….well
Waww que pedazo de tráiler se me erizo la piel te espero con ansias HALO INFINITE
T?
Im so happy that the retards bitching about woke shit and idk what else are being straight up ignored or only getting attention from the same retards.  Btw, the lore is inconsistent because this was outsourced, 343 didn't actually made this.
Personally I feel  343 completely destroyed the Halo series and has moved away from what Halo was.
So Canon means nothing to 343i? Good to know.
Xbox is dirt
OVERHYPED!!! CYBERPUNK VIBESSSSS!!!!!!!!!
well actually that is correct, they became the symbol of hope! go spartan 2
I just love how Spartans help each other when one of them is injured 🤙🇦🇷
When a video game made a better recuitment ad than the actual US army ad
Since England's Big Ben was apart of Halo's cinematic I can safely assume we're all apart of Halo lore. Just like 5000 years ago or something.
My only comment... why not take the scorpion? Lol
This video sucks
That was dope, halo gonna be my 2022 benching game🤞🏾✅ I’m treating it like it’s halo reach nothin but love 💕
What the game installs with the master chief action figure?
how's this a multiplayer trailer...?
great intro!
She has more personality than Sarah Palmer
I dont know why kids hate this game. Looks so good man! Good job 343i!
This makes me more excited for halo infinite, i can't wait for it to release
Yay the game is rated teen
All the same mistakes.
MK7 didn’t exist yet during Halo 3…and that brute armor is a Banished one and they weren’t on Earth…
Wow this is actually a good trailer gave me the chills half way through for some reason
Can I Expect Mumbai Server
💙❤️
If you tell me, that Commander Spartan, for whatever reason, is Avery Johnson's daughter, I'll believe you, 100% maximum no chill: She reminds me a lot the Johnson of Halo CE: cocky, passionate, caring and a natural leader.
I see what you did there, wokism creeping on Halo
what soundtrack is
Based off this video I’m sure we will be seeing some trans Spartans sometime soon
-You ever wonder why we're here?   -It's one of life's great mysteries isn't it? Why are we here? I mean, are we the product of some cosmic coincidence, or is there really a God watching everything? You know, with a plan for us and stuff. I don't know, man, but it keeps me up at night.
No coop. No forge. No classic halo progression. No campaign flood. No playable elites. Stupid battle pass. Messing up the halo canon. 343 really does not care what they do with with the franchise just so long as someone buys it.
This giving me Halo 2 and Halo 3 vibes!🔥
I LOVE THIS TRAILER, WOW LITERALLY WOW
After watching this cinematic trailer, aint no way the campaign cutscenes are going to be bad, I hope this game lives up to the hype and can become just as legendary as Halo 3 multiplayer and Doom Eternals Campaign
I like how they can finally make something as small as this but give it so much impact on emotion and connection to a character.
Is that girl supposed to be the Sadie from the odst lore?
This game needs to be for series x/s only I’m sorry but in the old days you needed the new consoles to play the new games . It’s jus how it is
O H Y E A H B A B Y
plastico
WE WILL GET SPARTANS BY MOTIVATION !!! Gen 2/3 Spartans y’all are baby’s
so much homage payed to the old.  From the music, to the ILoveBees reference.  ❤️
My heart dropped at 1:50
Yéyéyé just Exellent 💚
🍌🍌🍌
i love halo simple
Yay lore breaking cinematic!
I honestly liked Halo 5 a ton. I played some of the flight testing for infinite and it was ok. This trailer is dope, but for the first time it feels like 343 is going in the wrong direction, IMO. I just hope I do enjoy it.
great looking trailer, but it isnt lore accurate
That civilian turns into that spartan instructor just saying.
It's sad knowing now this trailer isn't lore accurate, after hearing about it.
Inspirador!!!
Watching the Spartans drop Gave me the same chills like in halo 3 trailer where they think chief is dead and he comes on the radio and says “not yet”
Played the beta for this and cannot wait for the full release of it.... lets go hype train 🚂🚂
I like where Halo infinite is going but this multiplayer trailer is inaccurate with law Spartan shouldn't have that armour it should be the old school armour and the covenant shouldn't have those weapons/armour
What's the mysic at the end
The Spartans arrive at 1:17, neat lil nod to the Chief if it's done on purpose or not.
Someone really into the lore please explain me something: I thought Spartans are/were normally always kinda obducted at young age, so since when do they "spartanize" adults?
Love the spartan using himself as a bullet shield in order to protect a civilian
1:32 when that spartan comes out BLASTIN and pacing is just the most kickass thing ever.
are the new spartans more resilient and efficent then halo 2 armor system? or halo 5 considering it was slightly worse for wear taking the revive system into account?
Ah yes, diversity. But only when its for black people.
Who is the target demographic with this?
HOLY CRAPUUUUUU
W
That was a cool trailer, but, how the hell did the Covenant/ banished invade Earth again? 'cuz unless 343 changed the lore, Chief was the only active spartan during the invasion. Meaning Earth was invaded again some how.
QUE JOFASSO DA PORRA!!!!!
Ok joke a side where do I sign in to join to become a Spartan Guys...
Goosebumps.
Diversity! I love it! Every time a kid sees someone who looks like them on screen..it makes them feel empowered and that makes the game and experience even better.
Did anyone notice that the spartan appears in the min 1:17?  Nice one 343i
Anddddd what has this gotta do with Spartans killing each other in online multiplayer exactly?
How tf does this cutescene take place in 2552?
i got London will never get tall building :)))
We never really got to see a lot of what other major cities looked like in the Halo universe. I love how Big Ben is just a small little building compared to the massive constructs around it.  And it's nice to see some new faces that aren't immediately hated by the fans. Hopefully the game comes out soon and blows away the crowd.
Just hoping its not 15 - 20 usd
AHH Yes the Halo gods are smiling. I cant wait to Tbag some noobs aye mate.
So what's the deal with brutes not being able to smell humies now??   Other than that great trailer.
0:34  It’s one of life’s greatest mysteries.
I do respect them, but at the same time, imagine not being able to solo an entire armada.  Weak.
deff looks like a 343 main stream halo game i dont like main stream. halo died after bungie left they are the creators.
This is such a terrible cinematic, I'm actually blown away. I'm even more blown away by how many people actually seem to like it.
Freakin PC will crawl it's way onto everything! Disgusting how this franchises has lost its way of revolutionizing the online gaming.  Fking sad sad sad times when they use whats popular 😞 and engaging into the gaming community only to stamp their political correctness amongst the public but most importantly the youth. This IS NOT the Halo universe story...
i think i might cry
Bruh her hand looks like a baby's compared to the Spartan's
Aliens invade London in an orbital attack resulting in $2.3bn of improvements.
Pls make a flat top crusader helmet and crusader armor
2:02 -- when she realized she wanted be one of them
This reminds me of the "Believe" trailers for Halo 3
Lets  be honest thins isn’t your first time watching this.
HYPE HYPE HYPE HYPE HYPE HYPE HYPE HYPE HYPE HYPE HYPE HYPE HYPE HYPE HYPE HYPE HYPE HYPE HYPE HYPE HYPE HYPE HYPE HYPE HYPE HYPE HYPE HYPE HYPE HYPE HYPE HYPE HYPE HYPE HYPE HYPE HYPE HYPE HYPE HYPE HYPE HYPE HYPE HYPE HYPE HYPE HYPE HYPE
Such an epic trailer totally ruined by the lowest testosterone sounding spartans in the world.  Why does the commander sound like she's a primary school teacher - and the spartans sound like school kids.. wtf happened to your casting choices.
Ok this is actually cool
Idk why Spartan candidates needed that motivating pep talk. This is why the 2's and 3's are superior
Loved this trailer, although seeing that “Season 1 Intro” in the title has me worried. Please don’t pull a Modern Warfare or Coldware where the first season trailer is high quality and true to the games narrative, but the following seasons are pure unrealistic cringe.
0:49 never realized how big scorpions are!
Finally a game that won't make me bored for a while, I was in desperate need of one
This trailer is very similar to the flashback in The Mandalorian where kid Din Djarin is saved by the mandaloirans.
imagine if they didn't kill Johnson..... *how badass would this speech be*
Is it me or did that last Spartan sound like one of the Marines from H3?
Spartans look and sound like cosplayers these days. Weak shells of the former Spartan II's
Goosebumps !
Lol this is some serious virtue signaling BS.  I really hate this woke crap
CHILLS
i really like the logo on her chestpiece i hope we will be able to get something similiar if not on launch then later on
The piano riff at 1:50 I literally can’t contain my excitement
shouldve put in the spartan IIs, it wouldve looked and felt better for inspiration
Getting some nice Spartan II vibes from those Spartan IV's. I like it.
The Spartan's energy shield and how it formed, flexed, and deformed around the model was the only good part.  The animations look like total dog shit, the dialog is cringe, and the Brutes look like the same bungling stumbling morons that 343 turned all the aliens into, all like they did with Halo 4:Spartan Ops, 5, and Wars.  I have zero confidence in this series anymore and its going to continue to be trash for as long as 343 keep making Halo games.
I liked it but when are we getting the campaign trailers 343
Daaaaamn
Waiting for this epic game
Fandamntastic! I can't wait!
Anyone else miss red vs blue
The notes of the theme just give me chills completely. Also the cinematic reminds you to ODST. Completely awesome!!! Can't wait!!!
Hape!!!!
Bangalore? :0
halo murio en reach
“In times of darkness” *spartans whip out destiny supers* “we are the light”
I legit got a hard on
The difference between spartan and normal human is crazy
Rated T? Is that just the multiplayer?
where is actual halo though.
- I cant hear yooou  - AYE AYE CAPTAIN
I like the Halo 3, Reach trailers. but this was interesting tho. London looks like a cramped city.. scratch that off the bucket list.
好吃
This made me cringe
Was that Saidi? 😯
Yea this won't appeal to the asian market well.  Scenes were just a little to dark.
Really well done! Love seeing the Spartans once again🙌
1:51 the iconic piano note 🥲
If this is how the integrate the multiplayer into halo canon, I’m really happy. But the T rating is troublesome I hope we still get everything that made the game great. Rating does matter going from M to T can ruin a game
I'm not convinced 😕
Whoever directed this give yourself a Pat on the back
allright bangalor new skin looks great
HALO 2: Season 1
1:52 dab me up
1:51 the piano..  BRB crying
Wow, London urban planning went down the toilet 0:03
Really loving how this commander type spartan actually gets some kind of back story. An actual reason to fight instead of Palmer just being there. Huge hope for Halo's future.
Kinda get destiny 1 vibes form the narration, which is fine I suppose. But why my spartan bois always gotta move so slow?
Ladies & Gentlemen, i cryed :)
ODST 2 confirmed?
What will be the minimum pc specifications to run halo infinite-multiplayer  my dear pc will run it?   Core i5 3470 16gb ram gtx 770 4gb
You know she was just a few feet away from being crushed by falling space metal.
Spartan recruitment has come a long way since the I have free candy get in the van S2 days
Duuuuude I'm hyped af even more now man holy
I hope she´s Johnson´s daughter
Female, black, and LGBDT+ .... they hit all 3
Looks like shit
Looks like reach in the background the Mountains seem familiar
So does halo infinite take place AFTER the covenant war? What war is being fought now?
This is some epic stuff
Yep...i peed a little...felt like a child again!!
Is this in jolly old London
Think i peed a little....
halo i hope you can change XP into cash instead i hate xp
hahahahahha i would laugh at that "spartan"
Should of released it closer to December
fireeee
Thank you 343 for showing us that ladies are inspirational and tuff! I just wanted to say like wow. We certainly don't see this EVERYWHERE! There's no way this isn't a knee given to feminism.
Dude I love the attention to detail
No me fallen esta vez como con halo 5
How to download the game?
Dam that opening was insane i want to play it just for the story yehaw.
Wait I thought Spartans started out as children?
Anduin Wrynn becomes a Spartan
It's looking good, it really seems like 343 took the feedback from previous games
This is a beautiful trailer on many levels:  - The drill sergeant becomes relatable, and is a great conduit for the viewer, experienced Halo veterans and green rookies anew, showing how personal her respect and love for the SPARTANs are.  - The SPARTANs themselves are tough, but not invincible, mythical and yet human, warriors yet humble - they can get hurt, but the focus is to work as a team, to deliver hope.  - The music, pacing, atmosphere, worldbuilding is simple, without unneeded exposition, and shows without telling in a good way.   - This is how you show Halo for the younger, new generation, while at the same time respecting the older community.
Token black woman lol. Its so forced nowadays its just so cringy and obvious
This really puts into perspective how massive Spartans are
So much SHIVERS !!
umm... those look like Spartan II's... are we retconning even more of them to being alive now?
This is so good I can't wait for halo infinite!!!
Amazing trailer. But who else is saying 'damn I hope that armor lock crap ain't back in here'
.
I like the rating mentions blood, language, violence. Its only missing horror.
I thought girl was the one girl in odst that  was with virgil
We just need the release date of Halo 6…………..
This game gives the nostalgic Halo vibes and builds on them so well. Everything from the lore through the artstyle feels so right. I hope this entry is really one of the best in the series.
This is sick.
Great trailer if like to see more of this live action stuff
Holy f*ck this is sickkkk!!! To bad i can't play it
Oh man I hated this . A black girl in London wearing an orange Vest Hoodie ? Like wtf is this ? I hate how games try to add more style . This is garbage 🗑 will be skipping every cutscene
cant wait!!
Please go back to real actor cinematics and if you don't - Please make the voice actors have some energy. That sound off scene was the weakest and most cringy Halo scene I have ever seen. Please honor the lore and actually make the Brutes a believable and worthy enemy, and stop tokenizing black people and women.
OOOOOOOOOOOOMMMMMMMMMMMMGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG
😍
Why is Masterchief using Astartes drop pods?
Not nearly as impactful as the ODST and Reach live action trailers. “We are unstoppable” is the type of dialogue that belongs in power rangers.
Exposing your back point blank to a brute. These spartans are SMART.
Ya lo quiero jugar
Awesome!!!!!!
except for the firing and shield sound effects, Now Thats Good Stuff
I need to know what Spartans these are meant to be. Surely spartan IVs right?
This gave me chills and reminded me of Halo 2
If the multiplayer is pvp only with no coop I can see it getting old real fast.
Maybe I’m dumb, but I don’t understand how literally anyone can becomes a Spartan now. Before it took a whole augmentation process that spanned an entire human development process almost.
Could’ve done better and should be doing better in cinemática like it was done in HW2 but was still good.
please stop using the word "darkness" to name any threat on any vidogames........its too cringe
I'm not happy they are pandering to the woke diversity hire mob. Making the main character of the trailer black woman in a position of power. Getting all to cringie now. Won't be buying it if full of woke nonsense.
Rated T? I'm already disappointed
Damn she became a Spartan 4
Please tell me the hands are fixed from the test build and look as good if not better than the other halo games cause they looked like weird magnets
now that's a sexy spartan
Let's kill some split lips boys
DROP PODS!
HOLY!, they managed to make in a 2 minute video spartans look way more human than the entire reclaimer trilogy alltogether, that's improvement
My god this is so campy like fortnite. I couldn't tell the entire time that kid was a girl and not a boy. Also, orbital pods don't drop like that. But whatever.
😃😃😃😃😃😃😃
Dude... Right in my heart... Finish the fight piano riff♥️♥️♥️
Aint that the chick from OMNI ♤?
Halo 2 sniper jackals would have made this trailer quick
That theme at 1:51 sends chills down my spine. What an AMAZING trailer <3!!
England in 500 years, only person left is some black woman. Absolute top Kek what a shitpost
Add playable elites
Uff fui el único que se le erizó la piel cuando suena el piano?
Yooo I wanna see more of London! That was so freaking cool how different London was
SPESS MEHRINES, COMMENCE OPERATION STEEL REHN!
I don’t understand why it’s the multiplayer cinematic. Just call it a cinematic trailer.
Random New Character: "Why are you here?" Generic Soldier 1: "To Fight!" Generic Soldier 2: "To Win!" Generic Soldier 1: "To be a spartan!" Me: CRINGE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Seriously, who is writing this garbage?
This made me happy
OMFG,THIS IS SO F EPIC,A WANNA PLAY THIS RIGHT NOW!!!
Anyone gonna tell us how augmentations make your body extremely big
Halo is dead and 343 wants it to die why else would they basically turn it into Fortnite f2p bull$hit it's just gonna be halo 5 all over again lol they used halo 5 minus a few mechanics anyways so it doesn't really matter lmfao halo infinite is just a evolution of halo 5 and it's microtransactions xD I hope halo infinite is dead in the water at day one and this is coming from a hardcore halo 1 fan etc.... 343 sucks and I can't wait for mister chief to come back :D
Halo always brings me to this place where I just feel like I'm home <3
i love halo, but man was this cringy
Never played halo before I have a xbox 360 do you guys recommend playing game by game story mode ??
oni propaganda team went crazy with this one
Cringy female commander
Goosepumps... Rock Hard Nipples.... Lets fkn go!!!
What's the soundtrack that starts at 0:30 ? It sounds so good!
This is the most anticipated game of the last decade for me 🥳
Halo Sjw infinite for Xbox Drm X/S and Pc pro gamers xddd
It’s confirmed there is no ranking, xp or levels. Only challenges when complete will progress through battlepass… it’s all bad
Nice to see Tyrone become a Spartan
That joints pretty inspiring....
well, It's the most unconvincing trailer of all halo games ever released.
Really hoping that these battle passes don't affect campaign and 343 can deliver on an amazing and fun campaign.
Why do the people in armor kinda look like Master Chief from Halo
Nombre del soundtrack
She reminds me of the lady from the terminal in Halo 3 ODST for some reason.
This just shows how small humans are to spartans
This nice and all but Splitgate beat em to the punch
WHY IS EVERYTHING SEASONS NOW? Please explain
Are people blind? That was the lamest shit I’ve ever seen for a multiplayer trailer.
If this any hint at the writing we are going to be soarly  disappointed ☹️
no more thicc female spartan :(
What are brutes doing in London?
E-S-P-E-C-T-A-C-U-L-A-R parece que ya no habrán ODST, es comprensible, ya que la tecnología spartan avanza cada vez mas
Pretty but kinda leaves a bit to be desired.
i want to play THAT game
My soul is ready, but I hope my body won't fail me, aiming isn't as it used to be. Please, wish me luck.
Aaaa , quiero llorar 😭
343 is like the general that tried make bart an his friends the "join the army" backstreet boys ... really hating the message this game is giving, and no yo say, but bungo just destroyed this piece of shit with a Ton, and i mean a Ton of coming stuff
So what...Spartans are just regular people now?
Too bad my toaster pc won't be able to run it: /
It never gets old. Watching this just about everyday while counting down the days to release.
Imagine playing a game so dead they keep dragging on the series after it's finished 🙄🤮💵😂🤢😡
They stole this from Fortnite 🙄
I was hoping Virgil would sound some alarm 😅😅
Now go back and look at the trailers 343 made that you bungiedrones shat on them for. Not so bad now are they? The Halsey interrogation, the H4 ending, Spartan Ops, etc. Well now 343 went woke, hope y'all like this trash. An entire Spartan team deployed to save shaniqua and her keedz, that also "inspired" her to be come some kinda Spartan big shot. Fuckin yikes
Algo faltó no me motivo 😔
Did anyone else have a black screen the whole time?
Have Brutes lost the ability to smell prey?
Drop pods don't just fall down 5 feet in front of civies. What were we born yesterday?
it had to be a black woman right
Anyone notice The Eld like symbol on the spartans hand at 1:53? it looks very similar
AAAAAA ME VENGOO
Brute line: In the jungle the mighty jungle, the jackals feast tonight!
John is my Spartan hero.
Sheesh Spartans & UNSC gone Woke./Me2..
Perfecto como siempre!
Spartans nunca morrem, apenas desaparecem em combate.
Voice acting is a bit wacky, hard to take seriously when it sounds like the cast of a Disney film. Would have preferred voices similar to noble team or chief. When the women says “I can’t hear you” it made me die inside.
I can finally watch this without a halo YouTube and their over excited reactions and screams over it.
Hmmmm very realistic  :]]]
Holy shit a girl Johnson
Aight time to lock and Load Marines!
Climax!!!
I feel like this could be a Spartan II & some Spartan III’s or one of the larger Spartan III’s & the rest are more average sized Spartan III’s. If you pause at 1:57 you can see the height differences really well with Agryna in the middle
Wow rating is for teen? That's fucked man kinda disappointing tbh
I got chills
HALO OF DUTY
It's very predictable seeing a future London, the main character wasn't even English.
The World; Hey that's Big Ben, that's cool! Every British Citizen; You mean, Elizabeth tower and without Westminster palace, this is outright heresy! "and we take it personally"
What's with all the dislikes??? this is awesome,
This is easily one of my favorite halo trailers in the last decade. So pumped!
bro why is people saying halo infinite is unfinished it has campaign and multiplayer
Fortnight fucked the gaming industry up bro I swear
"Why are you here!"  Most people: uhhhhhhhhh... I brought the game and now playing it 🤷🤷‍♂️
This game gonna be dead in weeks lol
What happened to "Brutes must've sensed our smell"
Anyone else notice how the logo for halo infinite, the "fin" in infinite loads first....
Bungie had a thing with bee's, so its nice to see 343 adding old touches like that.
Fix your body type selector it’s wasted potential, all three are essentially the same. Trying to make one group of ppl happy you excluded the other group who would like a buff Spartan or a feminine Spartan. Wasted potential
0:07 Note the Big Ben, this is future London under brute occupation.  Damn missed that part!!
"Spartans are heroes and inspiring". I guess 343 forgot that actually the vast majority of Spartans were war criminals sent to murder anyone who dared to rebel against the UNSC, including civilians on many occasions.
Love that they remix ghost of reach and a bit of music from halo 3 for this trailer which gives me hope for this game .
Halo more like, gaylo!!!!  nah jk . But thus  looks god tier, but WHERE IS PLAYABLE MARINES AAAAAA
.. Spartans.. it's time from Reclaimer to take what's on forerunners wanted us to do.. reclaim hope..
?????
Reminds me of the overwatch trailers for some reason
Really bummed about that T rating ngl
The king of fps is back
Game looks bad & Free Multi-player= Microtransaction fest.. 343 Sux
If only this could be free...poor gamer
Rated T??? Wtf???
This is basically destiny 3
HALO IS BACK BABY
I already love her way more than palmer
now that ive seen the costumization i think we need more body types, forgive my english not my mother tongue
IM TOO FUCKEN PUMPED FOR THIS LETS GOOOOOOOOO
Talk about underwhelming. . .
That was good. I understand why they were wearing the noble six armor. To remember him and reach. Or I could be wrong but still that brute chieftain is what I have as an action figure. Pretty cool.
Wow....the brutes look less like monkeys and more like bulldogs..          I LOVE BULLDOGS!!
Oof
Of course it has to be an African American female. Smh. And are you telling me SPARTANS the most insanely trained, most disciplined, intelligent fighters ever to exist, are talked to like this in their training/creating?!?! LMFAO.  The other sergeants in previous bungie titles actually talked like leaders & drill instructors. Seems like marines are trained better.... Bungie went out their way to do that. Seems 343 thinks the military is some magical hogwarts teacher BS.
"Season 1" ? Oh oh I can already tell this franchise is desperately trying to stay trendy
So, what? Did the new Spartan 4s replace ODSTs or something?
Strong and empowered, opposite of white, woman
Really cool.
2:18 ehh is that a women?
Her pupils dilated
The spartan's gloves are mendicant bias, no?
El juego estara en español
Yeah, so I'm just gonna say it. This is more a campaign-esque trailer than a multiplayer-esque trailer.
finally, a black lesbian is the main character
when that spartan came out of the pod... chills man
I just noticed after watching this trailer for the billionth time how big the Spartans' (who help commander Agryna) hands are
It was too slow 😔just like the chief fight
Cool trailer but that Spartan woman is no Sgt Johnson. It sounds so forced.  Lame.
I can't wait! And it looks like they are listening to (some of) their fans and delaying instead of releasing a hunk of deadline rushing unfinished crap! 💯🤘
A Mirror's Edge runner becomes a spartan
As nice as it looks, it only adds to the inconsistency of the series. A lot of games do this and honestly these small things add up over time. Like the new plasma guns the brutes wield during the invasion of Earth when in previous Halo games they didn't have them (though I appreciate their armor is the one from 3). Or the fact that these Spartans are Mark VII's. It's these small details that hurt the franchise under the skin for me. It's so refreshing with stuff like Bad Batch from Star Wars when they re-use old sound effects from the movies or old games to keep the immersion in the series rather than make new looks or sound effects. Halo just isn't what it once was and this is just the icing on the cake of problems this series has had since Reach. But, it's all good because the new game and its trailers look FANTASTIC. Once upon a time small details made an uproar, now people are like "It's good enough." This launch and series could have been so much better. It was... once upon a time, but people don't care enough to say anything or just weren't there to know what was so great about the old games. Halo MADE the Xbox great, but it feels like Forza is where its at now. Sad for me to see the old king these days.
I truly believe Halo has the best cinematic trailers in the game community
Low key she could be our replacement for SGT Johnson
Why can't they just make a Halo movie as well?
This is my first time coming back to the series of halo after 4 came out. I was hoping to get the console for this game, ive been saving bc of this but scalpers ruined it for me this game was my childhood..
Can u guys add like a local mode that has ai's like cod and other games and have 2 player split screen pls
Okay this is epic
I liked it better when the Halo Universe was dark, scary and depressing and spartans were drug-infused, kidnapped children instead of Coke Commercial Happy Recruits.
hyped
Caboose for MVP
Is that the girl from the halo 3 ODST terminals
I hope in the missions we can rescue civilians and they actually tag along with us. I’m on the hype train again.
@halo ADD PLAYABLE ELITES!!!!!
No cuidan a sus usuarios, de la noche a la mañana dicen que sacaran una edición especial, deberían avisar con dos meses de anticipación, para que se prepare la gente y ahorre el dinero. Abran las reservas y que el cliente sepa si acepta la fecha en que la entregaran para que cumplan así sea , 5 o 6 meses,  pero el usuario quiere comprarla. y tres días después,  ya ni la pagina de reserva aparece
I'm really missing Bungie when I watch all these trailers... I don't think I need to say anything about that gameplay trailer they presented year ago, which gave us amazing Craig meme... Let's watch this CINEMATIC trailer carefully:   Brutes can't see her at 0:15 & 0:21 (she is in the light, perfectly visible, one of the brute is looking right at her) and don't disturb her and spartan from greeting each other when they actually noticed her at 1:12. How patient brutes are nowadays for ladies xDDD  And by the way... when would there of been brutes in London and also Spartans to fight them?
Oh yeah. More woke nonsense. I'm sure your target audience can identify with these characters. Worked so well with Palmer in the previous installment. This is the least inspiring trailer of any game ever made.
I saw the beta, it turned halo into every other shooter. I'm so disappointed. I'll be sticking with the master chief collection and halo 5 until I'm proven wrong
Halo infinites gonna be the game of the century..
Halo needs to be rated M
Bro they should add dragon balls to halo infinite so that master chief makes a wish for goku to come and help them fight the evil dudes
This cinematic is epic and has me so hyped! I'm just wondering when this is happening.
*Epic*
MAN I'M SWEATING!
The music legit made me cry. I'm gonna get a Series X just for this game
Every one felt that ODST vive at the beginning?
Imagine still believing they do commercials to appeal to the demographics of people who will be buying and using their product. Pure propaganda
Godda love how dystopian London looks.
More personality in 2 and a half minutes than palmer has had in 8 years
Was that supposed to be new Alexandria from Reach?
I just realized, in ODST you may remember from the audio logs of a woman who wanted to enlist in the UNSC, her voice is the same as the woman here, and now I know, she finally became a Spartan
Get dis bish some chapstick
I will guess this trailer is present time in which new Spartans are being trained for the conflict with the Created. The flash back was when the Covenant did their occupation from North America, to Antarctica, to Chile, to Africa and so on.
omfg what a sick trailer!! and how good r dem graphics :0
OG halo fans don't care about the Toxic pvp multi-player microtransactions game. Thay want A Goob Campaign storytelling
Cant stop watching
I’m not crying. You’re crying! 😭😭😭
So forge not until summer 2022? RIP
Oh! Halo Overwatch Kings Row. I always thought that the game play looked like Overwatch, here's the proof. I really like the idea that we're supposed to buy the empty campaign as well for 60 euros, good work!
"why are you here?"   "TO FIGHT A COLOR CODED ENEMY BASE IN A BOX CANYON!"
Why does every game now  have to have a strong female in it it we get it women are strong too but come on !
Wow, I've always wanted a crossover between Halo and Overwatch. Slayer on King's Row is gonna be epic.
I crieded
Eso parecía nueva bombasa
I hat the way the hexagon/octagonal energy shields look, looked better when it looked like yellow and white and blue lightning mixed together  But over all it is pretty good
This game is looking like its going to be such a redemption arc for 343 is honestly can't believe it.
I remember when the trailers for halo was made in “live action”
So cool to see the Covenant again.
OMGGGGGGG IM SO EXCITED!!!!
reminds me of that line "this is sierra 259, you got spartens on the ground sir, we not going anywere"
Hell yeah that was awesome
Feeling chills. So many chills.
Felt a little like Halo 2 mixed with ODST XD
Was that Carter and noble team?!
i love the trailer but if everyone can become a spartan then what about odsts? marines?
Bruh I just went on the xbox store and saw this has a PG rating... what in tf are they trying to do to the series? This means it's for ages 8 and over... I have a good feeling this is going to be a very watered down child friendly game and I'm already not a fan at all.
Ngl this was a pretty weak trailer
The music 10/10
Cool trailer, very excited to play the game!
I love how they gave her a character, now I actually like her, unlike before where it like she was just a stock trainer made for like a few voicelines.
dang halo infinite is in 2 months. Im so sooo excited!
Bloody gorgeous! I'm so excited for December!
RIP Halo, fond memories. forever pozzed
where my noods?
Such a nice symbolism for the generations that have been with this game since the very first moment, people that grew up with it and that now play together with the new generation.
Why does she seem more likable than Palmer from H4, Palmer could’ve been cool but she’s just so…meh Blandish.
I’m so flipping excited
This was an amazing trailer! Felt like Halo 100%
And even Halo now is spreading ``THE MESSAGE``.
HOW MARK 7 GEN 3 COULD APPEAR DURING BATTLE FOR EARTH 2552-2553??!!
See, my issue with this is not because there's a black woman, it's just the dialogue is cheesy af. 💀
I'm hoping they bring back Spartan Ops, it had potential
Not bad I wanted to see that Spartan actually fight instead of the scene being blocked out but other than that not bad
This trailer was trash, all I saw was yet another game pushing diversity and inclusion instead of actually showing what the story is about. What's next is the game going to give us a shit story focusing on her struggles as an lgbt+ POC, instead of the war against the enemy?! I hope not, because if that's what the game is going to be about, it should be thrown in the trash, smfh.
Man it makes me crying
This isn’t multiplayer related. Where’s the tea bagging? Body shooting? Corpse punching? 😅
This isn’t multiplayer related. Where’s the tea bagging? Body shooting? Corpse punching? 😅
This gave me maddd CHILLSSSSS
*insert caboose* Neat
Este tráiler me llena de orgullo
Omg!!!!!!!!! 🤩
I'm so scared right now. I don't want to live anymore. I think I'm going to kill myself
wish my pc could run it :(
No campaign co-op = no download for me. Staple since halo 1 and piss poor excuses to not be able to do it on powerful hardware. Pathetic.
This trailer is just completely beautiful I don’t know what else to say. I’m so excited for this new halo game❤️😮‍💨🥴
Drop pods land : 😃ODST’s?  Spartans enters the battle field : 😳I’ll take that too
OMG I predicted this, I want to animate it Someday...
This is sick
In that moment that just your mere presence makes your allies respect you and your enemys fear you, that´s really something else!
Im spoiling it. The end of halo infinite is gonna be master chief or some other protagonist having to activate the halo ring/rings in order to stop the flood the biggest threat to all life in the galaxy which has been revealed to still be in the game, while humanity and maybe the banished because they may work together at some point to fight the flood, take refuge on a shield world, possibly reqieum, in order to survive the coming fire from the halo ring/rings and now everyone can live in peace, the end.
WHY HAVE I NOT SEEN THIS YET... OH.. MY GOD..
Literal shivers dude. 😭 I’m lokey interested in the character that was shown in this trailer, is she gonna have her own storyline or is she just a side character that trains Spartans 👀👀👀
ight who disliked something so beautiful
Why didn’t 343i make her the girl in the audio logs from odst?? Would have made more sense than this
Why I’ve always loved Halo was that it was never just about shooting aliens, it was about being a hero.
You know it’s good when it gives you goose bumps
No entendi una miercoles pero ta mamalon
Siempre he querido ser un spartan , creo que me unire al army:)
It’s gonna be great! Battlefield vs call of duty vs halo vs far cry
Oh my god female charachter that actually doesent piss me off right from the start
I will play when coop is available.  That is my halo.
I only play halo on day 1 coop to experience the story.  Thank you all for fuching that up.  I will not play until coop is online, as that is the only way I know how.
shes got more in common with the brutes than the spartans lol
cant wait for a 3 hour video breaking it down! lol
HALO IS BACK BABY
Odst cinematic was better
Guys I really want to say this is the covenant and it fast forwarded to the future right before they go to war with the banished but there not being any elites does not help my theory but brutes where part of the covenant. But my hopes where filled the cutscenes are like Halo Wars 2.😀
Holy crap am I ready for this thing
Halo Wokenite. I got the message! Thank you 343 and Micro$oft.
this looks amazing
now if i can just get my hands on a xbox series x
why is every spartan shown thus far extremely emotional and sympathetic. what happened to going on mass ethnoreligious genocides while looking cool?
Dope
The chills I got from this gave me hypothermia.
they're really lowering the bars for spartan candidates here. SOUND OFF LIKE YOU GOT A PAIR MAGGOTS.
Best news I’ve gotten all flipping year! YAAAAAYYYYYYYYYY  (Pray it doesn’t get delayed again.)
I’m I the only person that thinks as soon as a Halo game is T it automatically isn’t as good as Halo Reach? Trailer still looks amazing though. I just hope it’s not like Halo 5 multiplayer.
It's perfect ❤️
Meme de Leonardo DiCaprio señalando: "El pianito, el pianito!!"
I like the nod to the bumblee marketing campaign. but what is up with every company going so woke these days making ethnic/female characters and pushing that shit in everything? I don't mind as long as the character have depth and are  written but it just seems very heavy handed and pushed onto people and just done to make more money.
Kind of a cringe cinematic to be honest
Wtf are they even releasing it without coop campaign or forge. Why are they selling an unfinished product ffs. On top of that, why are so many people buying an unfinished product. These half assed game releases are getting tiring
i am ready !!!
Oh shit you can see Big Ben in the opening scene, thats cool. I guess her accent corroborates that this is england
Im loving the music. It has revived the atmosphere we all know and love and it sets the tone the emotion that it wants you to feel. Beyond grateful for the music alone everything else is a bonus!!!
London looks more hideous
343 Please stop with your art style, that phantom just looks terrible. Why God WHY did you take Microsofts biggest poster child of a series and say "How can I make this look like shit?", I am not trying to be rude but God please stop. The Brutes look great, that is definitely a plus.
The game better live up to this level then.
I smell a possible announcer, like from Halo 5.
The Weapon AI is a clone of Cortana and tries to kill herself after finding out. The Endless were trapped in the Halo by the Forerunners and the Harbinger has teamed up with the Banished to help release them. Master Chief kills the Banished leader Escharum and The Harbinger but the Endless are released anyway.  Interesting.
Holy shit these comments are cringe lol
I cannot get enough of this man I'm so proud of 343, their story telling and music is so good. They just goofed Halo 5, its story telling was good but the story itself just didn't fit in with the other games. I'd love to meet the music team and tell them how good of a job they're doing its incredible. Halo has so much potential.
Look how big a scorpion actually is wtf
Cant say for sure, but seems they’re moving away from mature war writing in favor of Avengers-esque super hero writing. Don’t know how I feel about that, tbh.
ahh the music
Was that London?
😍😍😍
Looks like they brought back the reach AR!
The voice acting ruined this
1:56-  Everyone: *seeing an injured Spartan* Me: That's that one homie that probably carried his team.
The soundtrack is special
1:51 Come with me if you want to live.
I LOVE BEES
Getting some hardcore ODST vibes and I’m here for it
wow I cant believe that it took me 1 extra watch  of the video to figure out the lady on the run was the spartan giving the speech
that was a bit silly
Are they going to realease it on console
1:52 - Come with me if you want to live.
strong black independant wemen that became some kind of a general. thumbs down. And ofcourse nwo you will have to ban me for my freedom of speech in order not to hurt the feeling of minorities. Such hypocrytes haha
Se parece al Myles Morales
1:20 Beautiful I'm not gonna lie I almost teared up watching this Whole trailer I can't wait!
Feels we will have Coop multiplayer, awesome
Why is it Dec 9th for Australia? If it’s midnight New York Dec 8th it’s still gonna be the 2pm on the 8th in Sydney Australia…?
The one thing I regret having a ps5
One day I might play on my mobile too
OMFG BLM again! I`m tiret of this
Big Ben is the Forerunner structure the Covies really seek, and the Queen, its custodian.
Just realized  Destiny hive are floods, cabal are brutes and fallen are elites
Average Brute virgin/Average Spartan gigachad
Spartans working in a co-op campaign.... Feels like something we wont be getting in season 1.....
So this game is going to fail. So long HALO, the woke cult has gotten ahold of you.
Is there new mombasa? Is she sadie?
Halo forever
funny memes for you in my channel 👍.
This has to be pre banished era and during the covenant invasion of earth I guess. Bcus if this is during infinite seeing the age of the commander a good 10 / 15 years have passed.
Are we going to address how its rated T?
neat
Lmao
Its bangalore feom Apex. Looks exactly same no racist
Gotta love to see people frothing at the mouth over a minority
Jesus Christ is coming to Rapture up his church very soon! Time is running out! We are in the very last days. Bible prophecy is unfolding right before our very eyes! It won't go back to normal! If millions of people disappear, it was Jesus rapturing us out! If you are Left Behind, they will tell you that the aliens took us, and if you are left behind Dont Take The Mark of The Beast!!! If you take it you are Doomed for Eternity!, and wont inherit the Kingdom of God!! Repent and Accept Jesus as your Lord and Savior! Jesus Loves So Much and wants to Rescue you!! Surrender to him Today before its too Late!!
Battle passes or season passes are literally ruining games now .. & eventually will do the same for halo infinite.
Ta chido :)
The odst loneliness hitted hard when the drop pod entered the scene
Every single piece of media about anything and oh look another black lady.
So halo is going to stop with the multiplayer offline?
This reminds me of those apex trailers and it’s so sick
Everyone so excited for a 343 game.....remember this excitement when it launches and the game is full of bugs, glitches and trash writing.....
Mehh... 343 is just going to make it another micro transaction disappointment.
10/10 to armor designs! they're perfecto
No XP at launch. No co-op at launch. No forge at launch. No complete game at launch. MCC all over again.
Amazing!
Oh boy another brave strong black wahman at the forefront of marketing
And after this heroic speech they unchained the flood to fight the Banished and the Harbinger.
Am I the only non bot posting here?

Set in London yet shows more black people than white people wtf
🤢🤢🤢🤢
Hello, can I reprint your video? I will sign your video on the reprinted content
Before I see any comments about when this trailer takes place. The stuff in the City is just flashbacks to 2552. It doesn’t matter that they are using Halo Infinite designs for the armor and weapons. They just re-used assets they already had so they don’t have to handcraft new assets for a cinematic trailer
"SPARTANS ARE THE DEFENDERS OF HUMANITY" - immediately cuts to multiplayer footage of Spartans beating the living christ out of other Spartans
2:18 "Are you sure this will help us sell more video games? "Video games?"
Is that Big Ben?
Woke trash
YES. We are all READY
- Why. Are. You. Here? - Life's greatest mystery, isn't it, Ma'am?
Почему черные командуют белыми. Это смешно.
Interesting story arc for Miles Morales
A conversation amoung the brutes.  Brute 1: "Brother I am back from E-Arth and I have story to tell you!"  Brute 2: "E-Arth you mean Earth?"  Brute 1: "That what I said E-Arth."  Brute 2: "Arrrgh whatever what is this story you have to tell me?"  Brute 1: "I was at this human city with odd out of place tower that tell time-"  Brute 2: "A clock tower?"  Brute 1: "Yeah that! Anyways I was part of the demolition group."  Brute 2: "Oh? You were? What did you blew up?!"  Brute 1: "We blew up this large bridge! And I created a song as I am good telling and creating stories of my great battles. Hahaha."  Brute 2: "How does the song go?"  Brute 1: "It goes as this:" 'Human Bridge is falling down, Falling down, falling down, Human Bridge is falling down, My Atriox!'  Brute 2: "That not bad!"  *Brute 1 and 2 sing it*
The stimulating fired correspondingly mend because wool hisologically flower above a hanging paperback. odd, spooky medicine
4 spartans: kills like 8 brutes Noble 6 and chief: Fuckin noobs
Song name is Finish the fight from Halo 3 if anyone wanted to know.
They should make Halo anime series, like Star Wars Bad Batch.
Cool cinematic give us campaign gameplay next time.
Loop for the effects of the armor shield💦
It would be better if chief was giving the chief not some bald woman
The piano stinger when the Spartan reaches out towards that girl got me a little bit not gonna lie
Sizue
I'm willing to bet the spartan that's being helped up got landed on by a pod
Shit game no love to the series
Please give us this music!
This is so fantastic I can't wait for the game.
London ? No way!
Oh Hell Yea!!! NOW THAT IS HOW YOU DO IT!!!
Interesante
The Halo 2 music in the beginning is so GOOD!
Gave me literal goosebumps. I can’t wait for the launch!
So cringeworthy.
why cant humans just make real spartan armours? like...bruh, its not hard, just combine all earth's money and make one. bruh, its not hard
Gave me goosebumps ❤️  Amazing 😍
holy shit, for some reason this gave me chills.
*Hey, to you reading* ... you are loved in this moment, just as you are, here's how we know: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”
te quiero mucho laurette
I liked the trailer, don't get me wrong because it was actually very good. Everything that we heard and saw in it was on point with quite literally everything that was going on. My only nitpick is when Agryna was asking the candidates if they were ready. To be honest, her voice should've been louder and more aggressive than what was delivered, but not too much. Same with the candidates. I also think they should've been louder and sound more motivated than what we heard, not too much on the volume though. The reason I say this is because I think it would've sold the cinematic to a bit of a higher level. I don't know if I'm the only one who thinks this, but that's just my opinion on that one thing which I don't see a problem in voicing. Other than that, amazing cinematic! I cannot wait for Infinite's release in December
This trailer actually reminded me of Destiny in terms of trailers/story telling, love the vibes!
Wow. How flagrantly stupid. Sheesh.
This will be a huge hit, beleive that :)
I’m confused on the timeline when the covenant were attacking, is this between halo 2 and 3?? Also, these guys are Spartan 4s right?
Cool trailer, but kinda stupid that she survived. Brutes have a extremely good sense of smell, if this was lore accurate she would have been torn apart in seconds
For some reason that female spartan reminds me of Sgt Maj Johnson.   I wonder 💭…
I have pc, so I buy on pc.
🌎🔜🔥B.C. and A.D. are timemarks everyone uses. Jesus Christ is the one and only Lord and Savior who Rose again. There is no peace without repentance and resurrection. ⏳⚰️🪦✝️
better fruits?
Is this new Mombasa I only think this because if the covenant  colors on the phantoms but with banished brutes I'm confused if where this is
Don't care about a trailer.  Need to see actual game play.  Want this to be good but I have 0 faith in 343.
aparently 1 trailer and everyone has forgotten about the last update relating to launch
Of course they had to make the person in London black. Are you paying attention whites, this is the future they are planning for us. To be a relic of the past in our own lands. That’s what you should be worried about
Now, this is was Spartans should look like. No anime style designs or balloon-isque ornamental features. Just like how it was back in Halo 3 and Reach.
what a cool new character I'm sure Halo fans will have nice things to say about her
I love that we’re just injecting regular characters into the spartan program and making sure that they’re diverse. Gotta love a SJW Seattle company buying something they shouldn’t have their hands on. Oof.
Yo the music is sick
No se puede reservar, la consola edición halo 😢😞
heckin chillerinos
Why the brutes are in the Earth?? Is there someone explain to me?
Did I just hear a cheeky little Sacred Icon Suite?
This was amazing !!!!!
So now Palmer is an African american... God damn it.
What I want to know is what’s in her backpack. She obviously keeps fussing over it. What’s in the bag?
Such a boring trailer. Give us an ODST trailer.
It's like The Mandalorian. She was saved by a Spartan and then became one. I hope this character is in the single player campaign.
I like that casual little nod the Spartan gives to the civillian like "Hey, don't worry you're gonna be fine."
Bangalore looking pretty sick
WE'RE IS CHIEF I WANT SEE HIM 😡😡😡
EPIC!!!!
One word... Goosebumps!!!
So does this imply that sadie from the ODST audio logs became a spartan? If so that would be a cool continuation. (edit) Never mind just realized this is london not mombasa
0:09  My GOD!! I didn't see the BIG BEN before :0!!!
1:52   H A N D
First of, is that a spartan 4, because they look nothing like actual Spartans 2 or 3? Second, if that girl is that spartan instructor, how old was she prior? Third, what year did that battle take place?
So this is what they meant when they said they wanted to give the multiplayer a story to follow kind of like how Spartan ops was. I like it 😌👌🏾
Waited for this moment
whens game coming out
Shows how inaccurate this is. Spartans were molded into it from childhood, not just ooo im a strong independent black female off the streets and magically become a spartan after a year of college as an English major. Like come on
Apparently 100% of video game developers just decided black women were the cover characters/protagonists all at once.
Yo 343 what’s this about no after match xp and performance bonus how can we grind out the battlepass if we only get so many challenges a day? This is Unacceptable! And players should boycot the battlepass till this is resolved! No co-op! No forge! No match XP?!? How hard could this be to fix at least one of these issues in 3 months? This is gunna end up like another halo 5 you can’t not have players sitting in match’s playing preforming well but having to wait till the next day to progress again it’s madness
Really hate that 343 is pandering so much, I really didnt even see anything halo related,  just a camera focused on a black woman.
Quieres? 🤌
I never noticed how big Spartans hands were until I met chief 🙂
good that im year 2500 african american people still have rights
The Only that bugs me is that we're gonna be playing the same maps for 2 seasons
Very cool, just wish the Brutes would've been using Brute weapons and not Pulse Carbines.
Love how they made the Spartan IV s more relatable in a humanist and non "bro spartan" kind of way . Spartans were  always the strong silent type.  They all had that trait.
Hilarious to see Big Ben dwarfed by all the sci-fi buildings
If Martin O’Donnell is not the composer for this game I’m not buying it. 😂
Why is it rated Teen 🤦‍♂️
ive been waiting since last year
🐞
I believe that Sadie, after Bad Blood, became a Spartan IV like Buck and went to train the IV gen IIIs, and she used the Battle of New Mombasa as a training sim. Why she became a Spartan, idk, but this can potentially be considerable if we get some new footage regarding the season's story.
\_¥_/
Remember when Halsey committed crimes against humanity and made the Spartans  to crush rebel insurgents and be hyper lethal assassins.
Cant remember the name reminds me of that halo2 map city center under construction. Cool
Oh wow so we’re going back in time before the original series!? By the time CE took place, Earth was long gone if I’m not forgotten.
Awful lot of triggered racists in the comments, I knew the situation in the gaming population was dire, but I thought it wasn't this bad. Really guys? Really? Halo is over because a black woman is on a trailer? Maybe try getting out of your parents basement for a second and check reality.
Hearing the ma'am yes ma'am gave me a good chuckle
Just wondering. Were they going for maximum woke? Of all the types of characters they could came up with…
Even I’m hyped for halo infinite and I play on PS4
SO CRINGE.............halo is ruined.!
Can't wait for December. 😩 First Spider Man now this? Shit looks 🔥
You guys had the opportunity to make a live action trailer and missed it…
Letsssssss goooooo!!!!
I hope we get some fight scenes in the next season cinematics I bet they'd look incredible in this style!
spartans 3
ODST 2?
Yo no estoy llorando, tú estás llorando...

Can’t wait
So Spartan ops is getting even more flushed out I hope could be an easy way to do dlc and shit
Woopedy doo.....blah blah blah is all i heard during this boring trailer
If Craig was there, this would have ended very differently
So jealous,that woman got front row seats to a Spartan vs Brute fight… then became a badass, Amazing!
If we are going by the rules In the books most of those candidates will die during the process of becoming a spartan. unless they perfected making them somehow in the games?
Everyone talking about the soundtrack its the same sound track they re used from halo 3 unreal😒
Wait it’s rated T ? So no flood?
Big hope is we see something like spartan ops in this game. I know it wasn't exactly a loved mode but I saw the potential it could've had in Halo 5 and infinite seems like the game that could do it.
Que coisa mais linda meu Deus ❤
Fantastic. Whos Excited?
Question: Commander Agryna, does she love bees?
She looks like a gay person🤢
What a shit trailer, stupid tripe crap.
Why didn't they use the scorpion?!?
DIOOOOOOOOOOOOSS HASTA SE ME ERIZO LA PIEL, HERMOSO EL SOUNDTRACK!
Whoa... the spartan coming out of that drop pod hit me right in the feels. I am way too emotionally invested in Halo.
The choreography of battle and the entry of the spartans is super bad. Reminds me of the intro of Halo Wars. Kinda nostalgic if you ask me. Otherwise I am quite hyped for the game after the let's say medium performance of the prior two games. "Of all good things there are three".
I'm glad they've got time for trailers for multiplayer, but they don't have time to get co-op right in time. Am I the only one who misses when a game was about a game and not about pushing seasons of multiplayer crap?  Maybe I am...
This looks amazing! The spartan walking out of the first pod had me almost in tears with how good he looked, if every season gets a high quality cinematic like this I'm super excited then!
Romans 10:9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. Mark 1:15 And saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel. Acts 2:38 38. Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. Mark 16:15-16 15. And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.  16. He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned.
I really like the hints of the older music. Feels like halo, can't wait.
feminist bullshit. would rather play halo combat evolved
oh boy sorting this comment section by new reveals a lot of racist bigots lmao
Exquisite… 😭
Man, I hope the Spartans compensate the ODST's for their rides they jacked.
Halo is now trash lol.Same old shit different story.
343 your giving me chills
i am... extraordinarily confused.... how old is agryna in the flashback? how young of a commander is she if she was rescued by spartans in mark 7 armor? or is this like the halo 4 intro and 343 was just too lazy to render actual mark 4 armor?
im ready mam
*me last year: HALO IS DEAD *me now: TAKE ME MONEY
The Music... ;-;
All hail the future matriarchy! Yes Ma’am! Haha
Well, sign me up! I’m ready to do my part.
They got brutes in london
mucho mejor que halo 5
I already feel more connected to the commander lady than Palmer
343 industries l want to make a halo comic l hope they let do it and that they give me the rights so that they do not sue me for my susede project before halo infinite with love a dear fan jair ferreira
Everytime i see a new trailer,cinematics, news from halo infinite. Im so excited dans happy to see that my childhood game is still alive and giving me the same feeling as combat evolved back in the days. Thank you 343. Thanks to you i have so good memories and souvenirs i could never forget. And thanks for what is coming to create other souvenirs and memories i would never forget 🥰🥰🥰🥰
Chills!
Black female ....Spartan...I'm so tired of this
OMG!
not gonna lie that actually sucked, compare that trailer to literally every single halo trailer from before.
I wonder where Queen Elizabeth is in Halo Lore. She's immortal after all, I'm sure the brutes didn't get her.
Wow... I am utterly unimpressed. You can show us Spartans doing badass shit and you don't. Instead you show us some person we don't give a shit about yet. What is this fortnite?
Where's the campaign, 343?
Is it me but the girls looks like melusi from r6
I like that casual little nod the Spartan gives to the civillian like "Hey, don't worry you're gonna be fine."
The trailer doesn't make any sense, but it sure is cool
Finally 343 knows how to make a likable generation of Spartans
i really admire to Noble 6 armour on Halo infinite multiplayer Concept art. Because i admire it. But.. i still doubt the reality lately. Because i was like and secretly admire inside of my daydreams creative lately. Each choices i already accepted it. To Doubt the reality over time. God will dislike for what i doubt the reality.
other than i think the drop pods needed a bigger thud this trailer was pretty sick
Best birthday present ever!!!
Can’t wait to play this on Co-op…
Some awesome Noble team vibes 😎
That was the worst Halo trailer I've seen in a very long time
I hope it is as hype as they are advertising
I thought Brutes had an incredible nose for smelling; especially human meat. Hopefully, we get new enemies because I'm tired of Brutes, but I'll take Brutes any time of the day instead of Prometheans.
I can't get over the size difference between her hands and the Spartan's
Amigo epicardoooooooooo
Lore wise the brutes would have been noticed that girl since the beginning due to the brutes godlike sense of smell.
this trailer gave me chills, the cutscenes in halo infinte better be like this please 343 , please Microsoft just please everyone
I’ve read a lot of comments regarding the possible lore behind the trailer and I’ve decided to write down some things that could potentially find a very close answer to where this all happens in the Halo Universe.  Let’s begin with the evidence as shown in the trailer and in the common Lore of the Halo Story.  • Spartan IV GEN3 MK VII armor was manufactured in 2559 after the Cortana Crisis event happened. (Source: Halo: Shadows of Reach. Halo: Official Spartan Field Manual, Pg. 178)  • Spartan IVs in the trailer were seen wearing this armor during their drop in the city of London, England, Earth which vastly indicates the year is set between 2559-2560+ Present Day. (Source: The Halo Infinite Cinematic Trailer)  • Spartan IV Augmentations, too, change physical and attributable appearance of human beings. Not as much as Spartan II augments. This could have participated in Commander Agryna looking so much different than her teen self on Earth. (Source: Halo: New Blood Chapter 14. Halo: Initiation Issue #2 Pg 5/6).  • The Banished are made up of multiple splinter factions, a few are known such as the Keepers of the One Freedom and such. Not all brutes in the banished wear tradition Red Coatings as there are Teal and Blue colored Brutes in the cinematic trailer and Campaign Demo and whilst they do seem to look like Human/Covenant war brutes, the Plasma Carbines they hold in the trailer weren’t developed until Post-War 2553+. (Sources: Halo: Shadows of Reach, Halo Infinite Campaign Demo, Halo Infinite Tech Preview).  This approximately takes away the theories here:  • The Human Covenant War never happened in London.  • Covenant being present on Earth after their defeat in late 2552, to Jul ‘Mdama’s Covenant in 2558.  So far, our closest time stamp that this trailer takes place in is definitely around 2559 - 2560+. Although there was a Covenant Phantom and Two Banshees, that’s where this sideline theory kicks in.   • After the defeat of Jul ‘Mdama’s Covenant, many factions of the banished (like mercenary groups) would refit and establish covenant vehicles, weapon and tech, etc. So the presence of those vehicles in the trailer could also mean that the banished had acquired them recently before styling them into their own traditional look like in Halo Wars 2. (Sources: Halo 5, Halo Wars 2, Halo: Shadows of Reach).  • Don’t forget the fact that the Reclamation had devastated many military controlled planets where the Guardians were sent. So the use of older or unaffected vehicles, weapons and whatnot came to the limitations of what the banished factions could acquire for their military. (Source: Halo 5: Guardians).  So now, what I’ve factually placed sets up the London Timeline in a theoretical placement of where and when it all happens.  Now, for the events regarding Commander Agryne in the Avery J. Johnson Academy of Military Science after her backstory on earth, there are two plausible theories in what timeline her present story takes place in.  • It’s late 2559 to 2560 (during Halo Infinite). This can be backed up by the Spartan IV augmentation fact. Commander Agryne’s physical appearance could have changed during her Spartan IV augmentations which we can presume it makes her look like her present day character in the trailer even if it was a year after her backstory.   Here’s the second theory which was originally thought up by someone else.  • It’s 2561+ (After Halo Infinite). This can be backed up by common sense in age growth. It could potentially be many years after Halo Infinite due to the fact she would look a little bit older in some parts of the trailer. And the creation of GEN3 Spartan IVs would probably still be active by that time.  Although, there’s a flaw in the second Theory. Written in the description of the trailer it states: “Commander Agryna knows firsthand the difference a Spartan can make — a difference never more important than now. Humanity’s forces are scattered. Desperate resistance efforts have continued to fall short on multiple fronts, from Cortana’s relentless martial law to the expanding power and ambition of Atriox and the Banished. But there is hope: a new generation of Spartans, training in secret to become unstoppable”.  This description implements a different turn into that theory.  • It practically means Agryne is the Commander of the New Generation of Spartans being created “in secret” during the Reclamation as stated; which very well means that the first theory along with all my other facts regarding Augmentation in Age growth and physical change and attributes along with the banished being on Earth in the city of London between 2559-2560+ present day, applies to her current status.   BUT, that doesn’t mean that theory isn’t flawed either.   • Agryne is the rank of Commander by the time she has leadership over the Spartan IVs, and if that’s the case, the second theory takes the spot as Commander was an non-commissioned and commissioned officer rank in the UNSC (If the military rank structure is still employed by the 21st century system) Officers would need to have spent 15 years of service in the branch to become a Commander if my memory serves me correctly. Although, the Spartan branch doesn’t employ traditional ranks. All Spartans receive a direct commission as an officer of the UNSC as of their active status, so the amount of years it could have taken Agryne to become a Spartan Commander would have to be within 3-5 years, approximately. (Source: Halo: Official Spartan Field Manual, Part 8: UNSC Organisation, UNSC Ranks Pg 139-143. Halo: Official Spartan Field Manual, Part 2: Spartan IV Program, Spartan Command Structure Pg 32-33).  Overall, that would lead the second theory’s time stamp as a Spartan in service between 2560 and 2565.  There’s one more theory.  • Despite what we’ve seen in the trailer, it could all potentially just be a marketing campaign, similar to Halo 4 when there were copies of Mark VI MOD Master Chiefs falling down to a city during a Halo 4 Cinematic Cutscene with what was meant to be Spartan IIs in accordance of the story lore. So the indication of London being invaded, a mix of banished brutes with Plasma Carbines, Covenant vehicles and MK VII Spartans are all just for marketing purposes in sole definition of presenting the Season One Element into the multiplayer side of things.  (Sources: Halo 4, Mission One Opening Cutscene).  Overall that’s everything I can bring to the table here. But if 343i end up writing down the Lore behind the trailer and it’s not even close to what I’ve come up with, I’d be surprised and at the same time, excited since it’s something I never would’ve come up with.  Anywho, looking forward what you guys think. And if you have any other theories, I’d love to read them.
1:50 the music😩
What with all this aliens obsessed with London these days? Yes, I'm watching you, Reapers.
Wouldn’t the Brute Smell her?
Wait the Banished are back?!?!?
Let's get missing in action Together!
Gonna trade my Serious L for a PS5 Digital, it will look great next to my Disk version 😏
Stronk diverse spartan woman don't need no man
Tengo mucha esperanza en esta entrega no me deserciones
the big ben's still alive but do you guys think the queen is still alive?
more forced diversity. grosss.
They playing with the sacred odst and halo 3 trailers vibes , but it’s fine this game will suck just because they keep doing the same shit year after year trying to get the fortnite kids money
Why is the main character in every single game trailer some black girl with the same haircut? It's getting old.
Me crying in pain ilas I won't be able to play this masterpiece of a game till next year may June
When I ready season my heart sank sick of video game bullshit hope the campaigns a masterpiece
dont like this "seasons" bullshit
1:51 that theme callback tho
Chills and feels all around.
Y asi es como se lapida Halo.... Que se lo devuelvan a Bungie!!!!!
This really shows that halo is the true icon of the Xbox console.
AYO DOES THAT MEAN WE GOT ONE CINEMATIC EVERY SEASON?!?
Se viene con todo! el infinito esta mas cerca de lo que creemos.
So Spartan op returns
Can't wait 😁💯🔥
This trailer lacks some fried chicken
London sure got tall.
😍
Release date moment
Mmmmm the spicy taste of strong black woman
She's already better than Sera Palmer her voice needs a little more work amp up her motivational speeches more
Trailer is perfect, but I wait russian language for this game
She's so strong...
Love to play this, but when the hell will I have the actual privilege of buying an Xbox X?
But Forge and Campaign Coop won't be ready. Really shows their priorities.
What’s up with the T rating? No gore, no Flood??
WAIT HALO IN LONDON I WAS BORN IN LONDON
GOOSE BUMPS!
this and bf 2042
so lame with the 'African female' character
Women are so uninspiring.
I’m 21 and watched this in a cafe. I wanted to Jump and scream, it filled me with joy and I felt like a little kid! :)
The spartans never die
Saved by Spartan 3s. Became a Spartan IV :D
meh.
So the flashback to London seems like it's supposed to be during the Covenant invasion of 2552 judging by the tech the brutes are using. My question is why then is there a squad of SPARTANS decked out in Mk VII and who are they, IIs or IIIs? To be fair I suppose Mk. VII looks almost exactly like Mk. VI.
Big Ben is still here is the 2500’s lol
😖😖😭❤️❤️❤️❤️
Scream it out Marines, got another giant hula hoop to go control
It's good but does have Tampax advert vibes 😂
what is it..? more brutes?
Aww I thought they’d release on Halo CE date
She is not a sparten. Its not just augmentation and armour. It's training since a child to become the best possible soldier.
😯 actually gave me chills. And I never even played one single Halo  game
a query, that happens in the streets of Nueva Mobaza or in the streets of Peru (I think), because the chief was deployed in Nueva Mombaza but the blue team in Peru (I think it was there where the orbital elevator of Latin America was), I They give doubts by the events of the game and the novels, there is also no mention of other deployment of spartans
Co-op mode(?
OMG HALO IS BAAAAACK!!!!
Is that the armor of noble 6?
I will hurt whoever disliked this. 🥸
I’m just saying, that gave me the chills and I love it🤘🏻
wow
Woke characters.
Amazing trailer! Absolutely loved it! So hyped for Halo! LETS GOOOOO!
Meh.
🧀
We wuz Spartans and shieet
I like the fact that when she's hiding from the brute, the music in the background is from Halo 3: ODST because that is the theme associated with New Mombasa which is where she is.
I've never cringed at anything so hard in my whole life. Wtf is this? 343 does not understand the franchise. Never have, never will. Trying to bring in an entire new audience while they leave the people who have been playing since 2001 in the dust. Shit is too pc, not even remotely canon and where the hell is Chief? Ya know the hero of the story? I think 343 has forgotten that. You don't just go to Spartan boot camp, that's not how it works. The Halo franchise should be put to rest forever. Whatever this acradic halo ripoff is it shouldn't be allowed to be branded as "Halo". This is a joke. I will not be buying the game. Can't play Co-op on Infinite on the PC I paid so much for to build? What a jokeeeee. Microsoft needs to step in somehow and force 343 to sell this franchise to a developer with some competence. Is this apex? Destiny? CoD? What is it? Whatever this version of halo is not for me
the luckiest human in halo "sir a possible voice actor has been cornered by the covenant" "Launch drop pods immediately"
cringe at the sjw themes
The music though!! Bravo 343
It’s impressive that the halo games just get worse and worse, but they still turn a profit. Whenever you feel like you’re too dumb to succeed, always remember there are idiots out there that will prop up your stupid idea and give you tons of money for literal trash. The American dream is real. Any of y’all can do it, you just gotta find the right losers to scam. Keep buying that trash, losers. You’re the true heroes. God bless America.
Cyberpunk: Halo
I saw the thumbnail and thr helmet looks SO much like Noble 6s. I got really excited 😊.  Then sad 😔
This gives me real Star Wars vibes
looks like a child movie
"Why are you here?" 'FOR GRIFF BALL'
This is a shit trailer
Its was good. Classic Halo. Except for the radical black lesbian with a nose ring. That part was totally unnecessary. Also, BLM = Burn Loot Murder. True!
this made th eburtes more bruty than gorrillah
AT 1:53 NOW I KNOW THE TRUE SIZE OF THE SPARTANS
As far as halo cinematic trailers goes, this was by far the weakest one yet. I’ve seen McDonald’s commercials more inspiring than this hollow attempt at an identity for what Halo should be about or “is”
THE HALO 3 PIANO LET'S GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
I look forward to not being able to log in to micro$h!ts servers
The main character better be Master Chief or I'm not even going to buy it
This is one of the best cinematics I've ever seen, I'm really crying with emotion. Thank you Halo and thank you 343i.
Axios!
OMG ITS EPIC
I loved HALO since 2007 and I still do
IM SO DAMN EXCITED
She should have been more aggressive when asking for confirmation. Those types of Drill Sgts are usually in your face an screaming. But these soldiers are trying to become Spartans... treat them like they need to earn the title..  But overall, good trailer. 👍
Shit’s gonna b fire. Video games will never b the same again
Burgers?
So is that sardie from odst?
I was originally super pessimistic about halo infinite but as soon as they announced free multiplayer, I was intrigued.   After this, I’m all in.
was that stephen amell?
Stop stop, it's already dead :(
Really cool to see Spartans out there protecting civilians. We're so used to seeing them in settings where there are none and they can just go ham on enemies its easy to forget about stuff like this
Holy shit imagine this as like a Firefight mode or something? Rather than just the fighting off waves, you have to protect civilians, extract them, etc, like what they did during the attack on New Alexandria in Reach
The voice acting left a lot to be desired.  0:16 that "huh!" sounded very out of place. 0:39 sounds like a 60-year-old woman voicing a 20-something year old 2:05 that whole scene lacked a lot of fervor, especially the "I can't hear you" and "again" which gives the impression she's never raised her voice in her life, pretty cringe  And keep politics out of games, please. It's a huge turn-off. Thank you.
Why does the UNSC seem like it’s full of softies now? Where is Johnson 2.0? We need a Johnson.
Poor penis blowers burning with halo god, who leave their dislike showing their despair of a mediocre company that is Sony, do not give them news but disappoint them
Hell yeah! I can't wait! We finally have a release date that will be well worth the wait. So excited!!!
Please keep LEGACY SERVERS ALIVE
This kind of gave vibes of Sadies story form ODST, hope they make a good use of that simple but powerful plot fuel.
Oh man, the music >w<
HOLY SHIT THIS LOOKS SOOOO GOOOOD
Ok this trailer was so good :) and I will forgive 343 about not releasing halo infinate with co-op but I’m still pissed about no forge but I know halo infinate is still gona be a great game oh and one more thing I’m confused about the situation in the trailer because I can see the brutes are no friends of the unsc but at the same time it seems like they where station there because if they did take over then I feel there be much more crazy in the city idk this is just what I got to say wait wait I got to say some thing else I’m sorry ok if it’s not a earth or some human place then why is big been in the back ground I’m sorry that just confuses me or guys I have made game breaking lore the British want to make a second empire it all makes sense now wait one more thing WHATS IN THE BAG
Let's go!
I beg you, please don’t screw this up. I have such high hopes so far
I love this, do it again!
The game releases on my birthday lol.
They are really kickin' @ss on the music this time.
Jesus, the moment the first pod landed, MAJOR GOOSEBUMPS. And then it just would not stop
Ooooh me vengo
this is gay
the game is going to be a mess
Anti-White propaganda
I really love how much the spartans feel like super hero's in this. I mean realistically they would be that beacon to the average person.
That piano... my god, gave me goosebumps.
343: "hey man can I copy your homework?" Bungie: "it's literally just ikora" 343: "yeah but can I copy it?" Bungie "this is why we left"
"Please sir, may I have some more?"
Que les costaba??... Simplemente, hermoso... Confiaré una última vez en ti 343. Pero es la última. <3
Hope Gamma Company Shows up
The character is so cringe and unlikable. She could've been made a child and didn't have to be 50+ in the later scene. Compare this to Sgt. Johnson as drill Sgt. What a waste of potential.
So Gen-5 is pretty much ODST now...
Got the Netflix-Diversity-Paintjob^TM, but at least they seem to be remembering that Halo was never a personal drama about introspection but a hero epic and the chief was never meant to be humanized but to be a larger-than-life culmination of the ideals of heroism. A light in the dark that kept going no matter the circumstances that inspired the best in those who beheld it.
Oohhmy god the music ..the piano from halo 3 ...I literally shed a tear of joy ! Please let this be a good game please please please ..
looks sick
hey guys the 20th Anniversary controller and console pre orders are already sold out..   So only a handful of you will get to celebrate that 20th anniversary with them... The rest can buy em off of scalpers..  Yay that wasn't predictable.
They shouda glassed the UK why do it look like that. Halo turned me into an edl member fr
I am so excited this dude right here is tearing up a bit!
Noble 6
Está mucho mejor está cinemática que la  de la campaña jajajaja
Cringe feminist agenda
It's weird hearing Spartans with British accents, think I prefer the American Spartan accent instead xD
*HALO IS BACK* OORAH!
One of the best trailers.. Gave me chills.
Anybody notice reach's mountain range in the background at 0:38, season one is based on noble 👀
good trailer but Commander Agryna's voice acting was pretty flat and had no impact. Iv noticed that most of the voice acting in this game is not up to standard.
Eu quero é saber da campanha, CADE A CAMPANHA
I like how that dude just runs toward the chieftain like he's not about to get one shot melee
More of the same
The sound effect sound like that from an anime - think Gundam - and I'm all here for it. The zing of the plasma shots, the sound of the gel layer deflecting the shots. DAMN
wow thats is greats😀
creating all contents for people of colors and LGBT+ groups is as racist as white supremacy!
I love how the beginning had ODST feels! Reminded me a lot of the audio terminals you found throughout the game
La emoción que me generó este trailer es indescriptible :'v
I finish playing the master chief collection like 2 months ago. That's about everything I knew about halo and many lore description from youtube and halopedia. It's amazing to see the spartan 4s growth, but the more I see them the more I can't stand the fact that this people will soon replace the Master Chief.
Nice
How to make a HALO Trailer:  Spartan: *Does something random*  Ambience: _PLAM, PLAMPLAM. PLAM PLAM_ (One Final Effort)  Halo Fans: Good Trailer!!!
Idk but they look short than chief
The way the Spartan drops out of the drop pod and just gives a slight nod before shielding the civilian. Thats the way Spartans operate!
Joder te amo Halo
Fuckin chills
why don't you guys put your differences aside and just make it cross platform to ps5
Incredible!
Were them soldiers really saying “sir, yes ma’am” ?
That music was perfect.  The piano, the guitar... The lighting too - contrast from cool to warm near the end...
Okay we get the point you like females with British accents can we get something else for once please.
Its a little cheesy, but its better than 4 or 5.
Nice Baby! Endlich wieder einen neuen vernünftigen Shooter😂👍👍👍
A truly epic trailer. Ever since Halo released I have called myself a Halo player throughout the good times and the bad. I couldn't be happier to keep on fighting.
Bery nive
halo literally fell for its own propaganda lmao
Black Palmer looks cool I wonder if she's gay lol
These "seasons" will ruin gaming even more awesome.....
Are you not able to play a normal human in this game all these years later?
This isn't Halo at all.
Well done, excellent cg intro and well done to the Devs, Halo is looking better than ever! The MP is going to be a hit, the Beta was fantastic!!
The way they built up those Spartans man, genuinely gave me some goosebumps
Damn. She's like... a MUCH better executed version of Palmer
Well, starting December 8.....bye bye responsibilaries  LOL
Just, they reach the perfeiction!
Phenomenal cinematics! This it what Halo's all about, whether 343 or Bungee
Were those spartanIIIs?
Esta hermoso, pero esas madres debieron oler a metros y detectarla
Did she just take a hit from a nade with no shields 🤨
I’m tired of black people
This trailer was weak as hell and pure cringe.
Love 😘😘😘😘😘😘😍😍😍😍 so good halo
this trailer was.... meh honestly. And did Agryna really go from civilian to spartan leader in ~5 years? that really cheapens the spartans and makes it seem like anyone can just "become a spartan" when that's not true even for Spartan 4's. For example, Buck was chosen as he was an elite ODST for years fighting on the front lines, this chick is just... some random civie :/
1:54 Just look at how massive a spartan's hand should be compared to a normal civilian
In the books I don't think you would survive that plasma grenade at such close range
I love bees!
Johnson’s daughter?
Game must be short it's rated T?
You guys should hold off launch till coop is in the game at launch
*People noticing the Bee necklace and symbol belonging to Agryna:*  "Yo that's awesome! It must be a reference to "I Love Bees"!"  *Me:*  "Nah, she must be from Manchester then."
Hate to be pedantic about lore details, but assuming this is 2552, why are the Spartans wearing Mark VII? Chief had only just got his Mark VI that year. Also, I assume these Spartans are meant to be 4s. Pretty sure there were no 4s in service in 2552. Maybe someone can help me out here.
Thank you 343
for 6 years, we have been waiting for  the release date for the game, and i have been waiting since 2019, and i have been playing halo for 5 years.
Es como ver a los Dioses volver
It's been 6 years. Where's the campaign gameplay?
She almost looks like Johnson. Imagine if Johnson had a daughter somehow :O
??? Xbox hasn’t launched with 1 exclusive PlayStation has tons it’s been delayed so many times it’s release will be a year after the Xbox series x
Halo infinite BIRTHDAY RELEASE!
HALO Infinite:        When sjw hits an iconic franchise          .......    ending in ashes.
SPARTANS, WE THOUGHT YOU DEAD! HERE YOU ALL STAND. FIGHT HARD! DIE WELL...
I wonder if Chief is going to have to destroy Cortana.
Amazing trailer. She still would've ended up like the civvies on New Alexandria though 😂
Wanted master chief to narrate this imo he should have been the Spartan for the job
Thanks for the release date information.  Though the CG trailer looked nice, wouldn't it have been more sensible to have it as an in engine trailer to show off Slipspace?
I like the little head nod that first spartan does😂 very nice trailer
There are 7 Brutes in this trailer.  c:
This does tell me I have absolutely no idea what’s happening story wise in this game 😅😅
I can't wait
We finally get to eat lets gooo
People on ps4 watching for no reason like myself
I love bees...
Really does feel like I'm watching UNSC propaganda. Nice!
Fish and chips is cannon now
i do not understand why covenants  doing in london ,earth
😭
a strong interesting female character lets gooooooooooooo its about time
Chills! Cannot wait for this :)
the female version of sargent Johnson
let's appreciate the colosal amount of details we have in those graphism, i'm amazed by te face of the lady
ive seen this marketing train in canada were this is no more white people on billboards or adds or even video games. always black females i have nothing against it but this past year there has not been any white people which i find suspicious . shows companies bending over to social justice pressures lol
Another black character here, another black character there. No surprise after what America did to Floyd. Now they will put as much black characters as they can, because we need to be politically correct, right? The worst possible thing at these days is the white musculine man.
This is why the Spartan-II's are so popular. These new kids get it easy. They weren't kidnapped at age 6 and forced through special forces training for nearly every single day for 7 years, go on spec-ops missions by 14, augmented with experimental or forbidden medicines to help boost their capabilities, watch over HALF of their brothers and sisters die while lying in bed powerless to save them, or to never have the chance to see their home again.  Spartan-II's for life.
What are there seasons in multiplayer? is this like spartan ops or something? I dont get it.
I love bees
I remember buying my first xbox and this was the first game I played. There was no online multiplayer until halo 2. This was the original Xbox. The first one.I payed just over $200 for it new from best buy. I worked summers as a brick masons helper. Oh the memories
Please keep this art style it is the best this trailer is epic!!!
Looks wrong
That's not the girl from the comic connected to ODST is it? And that necklace looks very familiar. Don't frag me if I'm totally wrong, just a question (as 343 seem to have changed history in places, as in losing the war against the Covenant).
This is giving ODST vibes
Why are you running? Why are you gae? *WHY ARE YOU HERE?*
This looks so good
lol looks like netflix made this trailer
Why are you advertising new content for a game that isn't even out yet?
I’m not crying you’re crying
The beginning kinda gives me odst vibes
Not sure exactly at what point my eyes teared up but my wife just asked me why I was crying… This is so epic!
Dang, we need all Noble 1-5 DLC now
Badass
ugh better not focus on fn multiplayer - haven't had a decent single player campaign game since Halo 1
Just like what Jo Staten said, it’s all about being a hero. Thanks 343i for taking the right steps.
The halo 3 piano actually made me tear up, it feels like halo is truly returning this time my 10 year old self would be proud of this.
The lore is busting at the seams, just waiting to be dove into like a history book ♥️
Seriously don’t understand the comments this game looks terrible don’t know what every one else is watching!
SGT. Johnsons hype speech was better in combat evolved
How cool would it be if the actual game looked like the trailer
Just don't steal girl
Nah brah where my ODST at????
When can we preorder and play multiplayer
Oh s*** the day before my birthday! Thank you for the birthday present can't wait.
Very underwhelming trailer. Disappointing
how are they going to give us a trailer when this shit comes in 4 months?
Thank GOD the odst drop pods are og again
Cringe af... Is this the fourth or already fifth meaningless cinematic/cutscene trailer we got
Reminds me of halo 2 delta halo mission  Cortona: Can we possibly make anymore noise ??!! John whips out the R. Launcher  Cortana: I guess so.
Love how cool Spartan armour looks, it's like a sci-fi tank in humanoid form
I like that we are hearing more electric guitar in the music, it was always a smaller part of the OSTs so it’s different, but I like
Brute: *throws plasma nade at fire-team* Blue Spartan: Imma pretend I didn't see that.
Yaaaaaaas. So many questions! So excited!
I don't feel anything with Halo anymore :(
I thought it was Destiny at first not gonna lie.
Amazing! Can’t wait!!
Wait, what? Is this more continuity bullshit? Or is this supposed to be present day halo? And if so, how'd a civilian join the spartan IV program after getting rescued by 4s? The UNSC picks 4s from their most extraordinary soldiers, its not something you just join.
And yet, Spartan Project was originally designed to create supersoldiers for anti-rebellion warfare. It was not meant to be humanity's last hope against the Convenient, just a tool to maintain UEG's power.
Spartans looking a bit sloooow, aren't they..
Show us moreeeeeeee!!!!!!!!!
As a brit I think it's quite funny we see more of England than America. Halo 4 had a few seconds of cut scene in Phoenix, London gets a whole 2 minutes. 🇬🇧🇬🇧
hmmm, no trans or asian spartans? I feel left out... this game is instaphobic trash !  BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO !
Playable Elites, now please
I dont like the happy go lucky feel of the trailer. The whole "wE'rE a TeAm AnD If We StiCk tOgEthEr" anime power of friendship kinda thing. I know they dont exactly say this in the trailer but the general light hearted tone of the trailer kinda sucks. These are the universe's most elite fighting force and they get trained like this. I mean yes, spartans do work better in a team, but show us the hard military lifestyle of these super soldiers. Do the whole jarhead slams face into chalkboard thing. Do something like the ODST trailer and show us the harsh reality of being a spartan like how ODST showed the reality of being an ODST. Part of the reason I think people like master chief and noble six is the fact that they go through hell for humanity, and nothing, not even all the medals in the world (literally, except the pow medal) will make up for everything they did for us.
The Americans idea of an English accent is, and has always, been terrible
What a Recovery. I’m loving Infinite more and more by the minute. Hope it buys up to the hype. Haven’t been on the edge of my seat for halo since Reach. 🤙🏻👑
Quiet inspiring in deed !
343 Destroyed halo
That Spartan turned his back to the Brute and was only shot four times? Must've been playing on easy.
What the f*** is this? this is not a Halo, but a piece of shit. Why does the Spartan run to the dense after saving the girl? Since when did the Spartans become kind and nice guys and not the machines for war that they were made with?
Sjw feminist wokester approved 👏🏽
I’m really disappointed they didn’t add elite to be playable what a let down☹️
*stands up and starts clapping*
Yoo this is dope love how London in 500 years still has the Big Ben 😭
THAT SOON?!?!?!?!?!?!
YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Where is Craig?
I thought this trailer was kind of cheesy at first, but reading all these comments by people who loved it have led me to the conclusion that I'm just grumpy. 😂 Looking forward to playing as MC again. ❤️
'We are hope' - nope.
MY GOD!! Halo 2 Weight of Failure in the beginning and Ending with Halo 3 Finish the Fight is like DAMN!! The feelings are OVERWHELMING!!
¿Por qué estás aquí?  ¡Luchar!  ¡Ganar!  ¡Ser un Spartan!  ¿Qué es un Spartan?  Un Spartan es un símbolo.  Esperanza donde no la hay.  En tiempos de oscuridad ...  somos esperanza.  Y juntos...  Juntos somos imparables.  ¡Candidatos! ¿Estás listo?  ¡Sí, señora!  ¡No puedo oírte!  ¡Señora, sí, señora!  ¡De nuevo!  ¡Señora, sí, señora!  Bueno. ¿Quien es primero?
Why are you here?  To fight!  To win!  To be a Spartan!  What is a Spartan?  A Spartan is a symbol.  Hope where there is none.  In times of darkness...  we are hope.  And together...  Together we are unstoppable.  Candidates! Are you ready?  Yes ma'am!  I can't hear you!  Ma'am, yes, ma'am!  Again!  Ma'am, yes, ma'am!  Good. Who's first?
Infinite really could do with a live action trailer, nothing got the people more hyped than that
gives me Halo 3 ODST vibes
I knew Spartans were masive, but holy shit their hand conspired to hers.
Looks like total $hit. Complete slap in the face for the real trilogy  I love how they had to make it all progressive as well, making the protagonist a female and a minority, really tasteful that is...
SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY!!
utter cringe
Really well made but I'll be the guy to say this is nothing compared to the artistry of the original Halo 3 and ODST commercials omgoodness
A rather satisfactory trailer but unfortunately no coop campaign at launch is a shame.
👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻
That was great. More.
That bee symbol seems familiar
This is trash, compare this to the halo 3 trailers like starry night. This games a joke.
1:20 I can't help but nod back to him... Lol.  This trailer so freaking badass as well!!!!!! Loved it!!!!!!!!!
No me gustan las imitaciones de los Spartan Originales.
omg. so stupid trailer. buy? meh  maybe killzone 2013 > halo 2021. lol
This looks like a destiny 2 bungie trailer, but it's halo
This is just to much,like I have a job n shit.                              *not after this.
So fkn awesome
I always LOVED how the spartans are so chill when fighting the brutes, like at 1:20 where the spartan calmly shields the girl, and how it shows how confident and powerful they are in just their presence, how 4 soldiers can take on a small invasion force with only their armor and their assault rifle, its BEAUTIFUL!
the feels
0:34 You ever wonder why we're here?
I just pre-ordered the collectors edition and the elite controller, I’m so freaking hyped I’ve been waiting 6 years and finally a release date to look forward to.
I cant FVCKING wait to play this game
Omg this looks stupid
Nice. I like the inspirational theme of this trailer.
I´m not very excited by the wanna-be-Johnson-Girl with spezial Piercing...sorry, that isn´t very particular, the Voiceactor sounds underwhelmed. But the Music is the right compensation and gives me Hunger for more.
what a way to make me completely unexcited for the next Halo the fact that you made a very simple concept trailer extremely woke and uninteresting makes me very worried about this game
that hit me right in the feels man i cant wait for halo infinite
Can anyone explain this timeline to me? Big Ben being shown means this is London on Earth, and these are Brutes invading so this has to be set during the Covenant invasion of Earth during Halo 3. But wasn’t Chief the only Spartan operating on Earth during this time, and didn’t Spartan IV’s not even exist yet? I’m confused.
Bungie writer: “We are hope.” Actual Spartan: “Hope is not a COA.”
Looks fantastic. Can't wait to jump in.
like the whole cept the visor on the spartans. those r ulgy
Did anybody else think for a sec that was Noble Six who first stepped out of the pod?
Y'know, I won't lie. It's kinda lost the magic for me. I get teary eyed from alot of Halo related media but this to me... Did nothing. It's a shame because I'd love to have that feeling but just don't with this. Here's hoping the actual game delivers on the magic.
What happen with the epic trailers  :(...?
I'm already liking this new character way more than Sarah Palmer.
Black people females in halo?
Where is my HU HA
Hot damn.
This is giving me ODST vibes and the music is giving Halo 2 and Halo 3 music vibes and love how the Spartans came out of ODST Drop Pods
December 8 ok im waiting
Halo inspires me to be stronger, this trailer made me weep
ODST units are rolling in their graves
I think a cool season name would be "Hope of Spartans"
Gotta meet those diversity quotas hav'nt we, absoloutley pathetic, is there only bkacks and women in the future if so humanity would be going backwards not forwards.
Halo is ❤
That’s gotta be an I love bees reference
1:51 made every 2000s kid cry.
Strong Black Woman. Good.
Yeah. This game's soundtrack is quite exquisite...
Everything about this trailer is just beautiful.
That was good.
When is this taking place? Is this during the Covenant invasion?
I like the apex like trailer hope they stick with it
Is this the girl from ODST? Like the one that was talking to the AI in the audio logs?
Just compare THIS and Halo: Reach trailer... night and day
Which timeline in this video? Looks like Halo 2-3 era.
Goosebumps 😍😍😍😍
I would've rather had Jun be the one to give a little recruitment speech. He's basically the guy who started the Spartan IV project
Anybody else weirded out that this game is T for teen?
This looks like it's made by Netflix representation squad.
What a modest Spartan. Pretending to be hurt just to avoid looking frighteningly invincible around a lone gal.
Yes!
Dope trailer, but I thought Spartans were super humans created from kidnapped children, how else do they get to be 10 feet tall?
YESSSSSSSSSSSS
W trailer
HOLY SHIT IS THAT A ILOVEBEES REFERENCE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
A little question. She is not the girl that is capitan of the Lasky squad in the movie of halo 4 forward unto dawn?
Why are you so afraid to show at least 1 minute of gameplay? Stop feeding us with useless garbage cgi tralers
Why is people hating this, is awesome, the graphics, the soldier story, the details of the spartan being injured, the shields...
That's two groups of bad guys who have taken over Earth in between Halo 5 and Infinite.  But I'm excited.
Spartan Lives Matter...
Spartan V's?
Wow. I was worried for a few months about this game… but it has peaked my interest
This literally brought tears to my eyes and it’s just a trailer to a season or game who’s released date it months away. Holy hell I want it here. It’s going be legendary and there’s no other way to describe.
This really made me feel something I haven't felt since MCC was announced
Yes Ma'am? that is like the most un-hyped soldiers I ever heard. It suppose to be HOORAH!  Sargent Johnson - Am I Right Marines?!
343’s storytelling is cringe
You know what? This trailer actually made me feel something for Spartan 4's, I feel like that was something about them we were missing to grow attach to them.
Gotta have the powerful black woman to end racism
YOOOO
Absolute trash.             Everyone knows he couldn’t have found her at 1:52, motion trackers can’t pick up peeps when they crouched and not moving
Absolutely great trailer!  The only problem with this trailer is that I couldn't view the 21:9 cinematic on my 21:9 monitor :(
I’m so exited for this game that I can’t express it
I wished this was a tv show on NETFLIX
the mountain in the background in the scene where the instructor talks is the reach mountain where noble 6 died
When Spartans drop in Croydon 🤣
Whhhhaaaaat??? Spartan IVs not acting like complete jackasses? Say it isn’t so
Ilovebees anyone?
So gay
Maybe I’m ready
Less than 3 minutes of trailer and that spartan is far and i mean  FAR superior than Sarah Palmer
,🔥
Afghanistan be like
0:33 "Why are you gay?"
I just realized they drop support for the GTX 900 series but are releasing this on the original Xbox One
Great Job, amazing! 🔥
Almost as good as the halo 3 trailers. 8/10
Halo infinit saldrá el día 8 si volteamos el 8 es un infinito *∞* Saldrá en el día 343 del año 2021 ( 343 es la desarrolladora de halo infinit) Se rifaron con la fecha de salida 👌

Wow
Halos back baby
Minority ✅ Wahmen ✅ Diversity quota ✅
When the Spartan gave her their hand, and then those magical halo notes rang, that gave me goosebumps ngl.
if there's ever a program to initiate future soldiers and guardians of the known universe I'm bloody in ✊
OMG THE CLASSIC SOEIV design returns
Wow GOOSEBUMPS 👍👍👍
I NEEED IT! Haha
Bravo! this is incredible
Beautiful
Halo Infinite woke
Too many black women
Do you think I can run this game on my Xbox one S? I'm not planning to buy the newest generation cause my era as a gamer finished but I can't deny that I'd like to play, at least the campaign.
I love bees
The music! This was perfectly made! Now this is how you introduce a new character. Already care about her than Sarah Palmer. Amazing! I can’t wait for this game!!!!!
ALRIGHT ALRIGHT
Did the candidates just assume her gender?
I hope the Firefight gets added in Infinite at some point too.
Reminded me of the side voice recordings that you find in HALO ODST
"Folks need heros, Chief. To give 'em Hope" Sgt. Johnson
I'm praying that 343i adds offline firefight with friendly spartan a.i just being able to fight banished with your own spartan squad would be awesome
I just hope we see Helljumpers
This the new overwatch? Pathetic.
A spartan from London. She's from the ends (London chat, you get me!!) . Yeah man I can dig this!! Confirm she's from South London @halo and I'll get the Elite controller lol
-infantry? -- High twenties, maybe lower thirties. We've had worse.  -Apes or alligators? .......?  -Jay? We got apes or gators!? --gators.
¿Que es un spartan?   un spartan es un símbolo , es la esperanza cuando ya no la hay en momentos de oscuridad… nosotros somos la esperanza y juntos …   ¡juntos somos imparables!.
Hoo rah!!!!  Long Live the Chief!!!
Those first street scenes with Brutes reminds me so strong to Sadie's history.  'Sadie -- Sadie -- Sadie -- Sadie!' 'Sadie, sweetheart... You make me very, very proud.'
Gonna be honest, when the first drop pod landed I thought an ODST or even Sargent Johnson was gonna jump out.
Nice smoke screen of a forest fire
I love bees..?
joder :'0
HYPED! These graphics looked PHENOMENAL!
Guys is this a multiplayer campaign? I'm confused
Why the forced diversity though?
OMFG!! I loved this!!!  Please tell me those are Spartan III’s
Ira nomás que bonito
Yooo
Could they please glass London
"Why are you here?"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Griff: : "Just to suffer"
AWESOME 💫🥳🥳🥳🥳
Why this shit got me emotional 😪😫
I'm ready! How 'bout you?   Emile
im fully erect rn
A su madre es Miles Morales.
Such wow
THE MUSIC OMG!!!!!
When did the brutes attack London?
I can’t wait
OH MY GOD I CANT WAIT
Gracias 343. 🥲
The music gave me blue balls
Epico, lo amo :3
Yes Ma'm
Halo Infinite bringing back the true meaning of a Spartan.
Gimme more!
That kinda looks like the rebel symbol for Assassin's Creed Valhalla. From the DLC "Siege of Paris"
For a second there I thought she was that girl from those halo Odst audio logs
Spartans are effing huge bruh
I got a bit emotional when the spartan reached out to her and seeing the transition from civie to becoming a spartan was badass. Absolutely beautiful.
As one Spartan once said...  "I'M READY! HOW 'BOUT YOU?"
343 la saco del estadio
Only one spartan is unstoppable.
bungie: "lets make the elites look advanced and sleek and the brutes look barbaric and crude." 343: "lets make the elites look barbaric and crude and the brutes look advanced and sleek." but anyways, still looks kickass.
Dope trailer but are we getting the multiplayer that was showcased in the first multiplayer trailer? Because the beta gameplay that was live streamed wasn’t even close and this game releases in less than 4 months.
:) makes me happy, makes me smile
Amazing trailer, halo is back.  Drill sergeant lacks charisma and power tho...
really corny, but ok
Did 343 cut out odst's? bruh for a moment I thought Odst's were dropping not spartans lol
1:51 - 1:56 Halo Veterans: **Hears certain piano notes** Halo Veterans: **Gets Finish the Fight flashbacks** Also Halo Veterans: "I felt that."
Sinceramente hermoso ❤️🤤
Strong Michael Burnham vibes. Major red flags.
Am I happy that theres finally a release date, Absolutely yes  am I still salty I didn't get into the beta?       also yes..
cool, but campaign co op is delayed
December 8, fellas. The waiting will be worth it...            Even if there's no forge or co-op at the beginning. We've waited long enough.
I know what I'll be doing on my Christmas Break from College.
Dope as makes me so keen
December 8th!
Que trailler!!! Maravilhoso!!! Só esperando essa preciosidade chegar no meu XBox One X!!! ✌️😎👍
That was surprisingly good.
This is where Halo 2 started then Halo 3 along with its spinoff Halo 3 ODST when Commander Argyna is surviving in London. 0:04. 🧐.
Unsc: yes the suits make you taller
Wow, they're actually making Spartan IV's cool and likeable
Yknow, aside from the setbacks regarding Co-op and forge...As long as the rest of the game is fine...I think I can wait.
An odd fight but it's fine.
Damm the sounds make me so nostalgic
Are these a new spartan generation? Or are they the 4's?
I am waiting for forge and co op to play this game no download on game pass
I'm glad they're already giving the characters backstories.  I like the fact they're touching on how she was inspired to become a spartan.  It really humanizes the characters, something that we didn't see in H4 / H5.
Can't Wait!!
Dam that brought deep emotion up,  great job!!
First halo I ever played was halo 3 then 2 then reach then 4 then 5 then 1
Pains me to see a broken tank
I’m glad they put some of the halo 2 arbiter theme on here
Lame, more race baiting with the black female, more reasons to not buy campaign.
IT WAS SOO AWESOMMEE
now that's an interesting character
A bit cheesy, but I'll take it.
Mama yes mama sounds odd and cringe I’d rather say sir
That jump cut from child to adult reminds me of the "We are ODST" trailer.
I hate it when games get announced so early, imagine if this got posted on december 7th and it would be like "HALO TOMORROW??!!!"
so was that the covenent or the banished? I assume covenant based on the time jump, but did the covenant ever attack London? Also voice acting was trash bro xD  also that chick aged fast. Also those drop pods hit like a wimpy punch. Also yes i am fun at parties.
No way the chick from the odst audio logs. ?
hate her already
halo is back
The iconic music was the BEST part of the trailer, it really shows that the Spartans are the hope of humanity. Being a spartan means standing to fight when others flee, to offer hope when there is none, to stop the enemy with the means at your disposal, and to ensure that humanity will have a future in the galaxy. Love the story here, and nice touch with the necklace being the emblem of the spartan! And dear god the Spartans are really huge compared to a human teenager.
1:02 "What is a Spartan?" Me: An machine
I love that Mark VIII helmet so much. Absolutely nailed the designs.
So, even civilians can become Spartans now?   Master Chief: "Am I a joke to you?"
Sounds a lot like Suzie McGrath playing the main character! I've looked and haven't been able to confirm it.
im starting to appreciate the brute design in infinite. more, now that i'm finally seeing them with proper lighting and textures. especially the faces. i know 343 needed to show some actual gameplay at e3. to confirm that they were working on the game, but could they at least try to avoid showing their faces. although we would have not gotten the memes
I'm getting some serious Destiny vibes from this trailer, with the Covenant looking like the Cabal and everything. Can't wait!
craig looking gooooood!!
This trailer was kinda cringe not gonna lie.   Cool tank though. Like the brutes.
Ok... where is Sarah Palmer?
I'm crying, that was absolutely wicked!
I feel like ur hiding stuff
even halo goes woke, smh
what a great trailer
The way she gives her speech reminds me of Zavala from Destiny but with a tad more zeal
Maneeee I hope we can still see real ODSTs in the campaign
Holy shit this looks amazing
EPIC !!!! THIS GAME WILL BE UNSTOPPABLE!
Ehh
Hype
I like that this is set when the covenant proper exsisted bc of the style of phantom. This means those spartans are supposed to be spartan 2s or 3s. So like a child at reach is now old enough to be a spartan with the time between reach and infinite.
6 years of waiting
This trailer but imagine it being live action 😳
Omg is located in London land <3
And when do we get all the missing content?
Wth was she trying to do running towards the enemy like that
When those piano notes dropped and the guitar came in, I got mad chills.
they would have not survived that plasma grenade...       lol
When the Leitmotif just right…
December 8th!
Cringe af
December 8, 2021, great, thanks for the news, see you then Spartans 👊🏼🙏🏼
This trailer was obviously played on "easy".
Weak. I wanna see the continuation of the infinity story for the seasons Not some new stupid strong, independent,  wahman story.
june himself would be impressed!
I cried hearing that music
I love the cyber city story trailer and the scifi city concept art is great
Half a game for half the price right?
About damn time😎
I cried the reminds me so much of that spark of hope for humanity that halo gives you that's been missing the last 3 game's
That finish the fight piano part tho
I'm choking up in tears man.
I love bees
So.. is there no more OSDTs?
Oh hey look it’s a black woman. I almost made it six whole minutes without seeing a black woman shoehorned into pop media
Gonk
Me acaban de hacer llorar, buen tráiler.
I thought season 1 was fall of reach??? Edit: “Heroes of reach”
El multiplayer se ve bien pero creo que para estas alturas deberia tambien a ver publicidad de la campaña y pues todo lo contrario no se menciona nada sobre la campaña
This was awesome, it’s nice to see that now we have a release date
I kind of don't like how London is all skyscrapers. I would think realistically the historical part of London would be preserved as old London and the sky scrappers would be built around that. But maybe not.
Awesome so glad we got the release date now.
the chills i felt watching this is unreal
These trailers echo so very shallow in the history of prior Halo ad campaigns. Compare this disappointing trailer to “We are ODST” or “Halo 3 Believe”.   Missed the mark by a mile. :-(
Am I the only one who thought she was Sadie Endesha on the streets of New Mombasa? Cool trailer :D
Yo the game is out on my birthday, I'm even more hyped 😆😆
I guess the kind of forgot the Master Chief was never in London fighting the covenant off Earth during the invasion during Halo 2-3, And Blue team was about to board a ship bound for Onyx around that time, Also not in London. I mean its old lore. Ah well.
nah he trippin
Se viene lo mero bueno con esta sexta entrega....estoy super emocionado...
Now is that Earth when the Covenant were there, or an Earth with Banished?
Fccckk this gonna be so freakin awesome!!
12/07/2021
Oh my landa...his hand is the size of her!
Amazing!
343 really gives no shits about the campaign fans lmao
Very Beautiful Very Powerful
I love how he walks out of the jump pod and is like "sup"
2:07 where is the fire in her voice?
Holy shit that is a lot of detail
Absolutely beautiful! What a badass trailer! That classic halo 2 music and then the hope piano! Holy cow, man! I love to see halo through the eyes of regular civilian people!   So damn cool seeing those huge badass SPARTANS dropping down! What a powerful presence they have! I'm hyped, bro this looks sick! It's got that earth halo tone to it! ❤ :')
Hell yeah man this looks great!
0:18 Is it that girls from ODST who was running around on trains and stuff, whos father was some researcher?
I am so into this
That Halo 2/3 music mixing in with the new Halo Infinite MP Suite is such an amazing thing.
To bad we will never see this in game.
I can finally be one of those commenters that say “WOW THAT’S ON MY BIRTHDAY!” and get hundreds of likes within months.  Oh cool the date at the end of the trailer is my birthday!
Why does this trailer feel like Overwatch? Specifically Mercy’s trailer
zzzzzzzzzzzzz
That iconic piano theme when the Spartan reached their hand out my got that was amazing
yes
😍😍😍😍😍
Overwatch 2 looks pretty cool
That bee... Halo 2 campaign?
This sucks they would have smelt her
What is Bangalore doing in a Halo game?
Epic
Epic.  Absolutely epic.  The music, the rousing speech, the environment.  And best of all, it does that while still having that Halo feel.  Well done.
Where is master chief idc ab those Spartans
this honestly felt like the halo i remember
Why are you here?  Well you see. It’s one of life’s great mysteries isn't it? Why are we here? I mean, are we the product of some cosmic coincidence, or is there really a God watching everything? You know, with a plan for us and stuff. I don’t know, man, but it keeps me up at night.
Is it possible this Spartan IV is Sadie Endesha?
Fucc i need a Xbox too now bruh , haven't played Halo since Halo 2 on the 360 😭😭😭😭
"Folks need heroes Chief. To give em hope."
No one is mentioning the fact that the Big Ben is still there, surrounded by the massive futuristic buildings.  It’s literally 700 years old at that time!
Aren't the brutes supposed to have one of the best sense of smell in the Halo universe?
gaming
These comments all sound like bots.
That was rlly cute
This is one of the most interesting opening for a multiplayer when you log on for the first time.
All of this *looks* incredible, but the dialogue is pure cringe. Did they ring Brian Reed back up for this one?
Pls… just take my money 🔥
I really want to see the campaign
a two-meter black woman, what else to dream of, after such a trailer, I definitely will not pre-order
Idk the trainees weren't screaming enough. Would've been better if it was a drill sergeant. They on some space force shit lmao
I wonder if we will get a multiplayer game mode with little missions and stuff that would be great
Those brutes would smell her and eat her up before she could get saved.
Shut up and take my money !
The multiplayer wasn’t interested but this Does completely catch my attention but  I guess time diffrence is a lot since she looked older I’m really looking forward to campaign for now it’s bf2042 this month so hopefully preorder special comes up for halo
💚💚💚
1:51 chills.
Still waiting on when the series x will even come available
HECK YES LETS GHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
FRIGGIN INCREDIBLE
YO HYPE
i like it overall but im confused when this was supposed to have happened did the banish attack earth at some point or is it the covenant invasion of earth (my screen is small so i cant tell what color the phantom is) and if its the second one why are there spartans in gen 3 Mjolnir
Right after EckhartsLadder did a video talking his concerns about Infinite BECAUSE they hadn't given a release date yet, we get one! Either someone at 343 is watching his channel, or this is pure coincidence... most likely the latter.
The trailer drops and big gamer YouTubers are now setting up their Screen, Computer, Mic, & Capture Cards so they can react to it blindly even though they watched it 3 or 4 times already. 😂😂😂 Some are already breaking it down into pieces by now. 💀💀💀
when did this take place be cause its i assume earth in 2552 but inifinite takes place in 2560 and ya 8 years but the difference in the look of her age from then to now is staggering
Stupid halo, game for noob call of duty player, Captain Price is better than stupid mastrt Chief
343 always slacking,  cut all the action😤🤣 dope tho
This trailer was kind of cringy..
HOLY SHIT IM SO FUCKIN EXCITED
Can't wait.
This made me feel like im  back In 07 when halo 3 dropped
H.O.P.E
Can't wait
I just wish they put as much effort in to making the game as they do making cut scenes oh well rip
OMG i would 100% play a halo game with the commandeer as main character, btw ¡fking awesome trailer gave me chills!
0:32 -Why are you here?  -It's one of life's greatest mysteries, isn't it? why _are_ we here? I mean, are we the product of some cosmic coincidence, or, is there really a god? Watching everything? You know, with the plan for us and stuff.. I don't know man.. but it keeps me up at night.
I am very disappointed in 343 releasing an incomplete product. Then we should only have to pay half price.
I can’t wait
Chills when the piano dropped and they reached out their hand
I can't wait for all the color combinations oh man.
YEAHHHH BABBYYYYY
00:40 could’ve been the perfect spot for a RVB reference lmao
😭😭😭
The best franchise ever😢
IM SO READY FOR THESE EVERY SEASON
Fantastic. Halo Universe approved.
"Sorry we can't do co op campaign, we're too busy making trailers for our battle pass- uhhh I mean season for you to pay for every few months."
I want this song.please
Just another trailer to always put a smile on are faces
Way too kid friendly. I would have liked it more if the banished were firing into crowds of people like in the halo 4 opening cinematic. Weren't much of a threat here.
Isn't she the girl you find the holo tapes of in halo 3 odst?
Change the voice trailer becomes better
Legend has it...     She grew 3 feet that day.
Bloody amazing
I'M READY! HOW BOUT' YOU!
Just wow
This reminded me of the odst trailer, which will forever be my favorite video game trailer of all time.
this stinks of wokeness....  wheres the action choreography?  what happened to fast thorough takedowns?
When tf does this take place, *2552?* *Laurette* is a child and *MK VIIs* are on *Earth WITH* the *COVENANT?*   The shill tubers are creaming themselves in the comments while neglecting 343’s inconsistencies with the canon as usual. 🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️ This is H4’s intro all over again.
This looks epic! Can't wait for when Halo drops. This is going to be a great game.
HALO IS BACK BABY
Been a while since a Halo trailer has had this kind of feels to it.
>All the checkmark Youtube accounts shilling in the top comments
W
Woooow !!! Some background story finally and we might actually like her 🤟🔥
Yup, put the "Stunning and Brave" BLM Wahman in charge of training us Spartans. Nope, I'm out, the second you put forced diversity, inclusion and woke politics into what's supposed to be a form of escape from the BS of daily life, you can count me out.
I'll tell you what a Spartan isn't.          *A LESBIAN BLACK WOMAN.*
Hyped me up
Nobody cares about empowerment. Too much corporate virtue signaling, just give us a cool game
Yes this was so amazing so hyped
Hyped me u0
Is that a bee on her necklace if it is it could be a reference to i love bees
Yet a gaaay guy called "rubius" says Halo died with Reach, never anyone has been so fking wrong
This game better not be rated T
This trailer got me so pumped that I want to enlist into the UNSC
Maybe DICE AND EA, should get an example from this, it was much more thrilling than 2042, it's been a long time since I've seen a real good trailer like this 👍🏻, love you Microsoft
I might be a bit early saying this but... HALOS BACK BABY!!!! WOOOO
1:14 I'm not trying to be a nit-picker but she would have been hurt from the rocks blasted from the drop-pods at that distance. Mabey they upgraded their drop-pods with antigravity nodes to slow the pod's descent. Again, I love, love, love this.
Why’s no one talking about why there wasn’t a lot more debris and smoke coming from the ground where the drop pods landed? Those are ORBITAL DROP PODS. Them shits hit hard and fast into the ground below. Just look at the 2nd pod that lands. It looks like it flutters down safely like a goddamn butterfly. We should FEEL the impact of that pod tearing into the ground. Not just a light thud…
Amazing! Can't wait!
epico 343   legendary work
so its gonna be sick asf if we get some of infinites campaign on earth
I kinda wished that girl is related to Johnson
This writing is just meaningless cliche talk. This game is not going anywhere, halo concluded with bungie
This gave me chills!!!!! Love it!
Didn't originally like this Character but she has an interesting backstory so gives context now to appreciate her.
Is that Sadie from new mombasa?
That piano though. H3 feels all the way.
HOLY EFFING SH@(&^ TAKE MY EFFING MONEY BRO!!!!!!!!
OMG This trailer make me cry, is to beautiful.
spartan 2s an inspiration to everyone on infinite. I HOPE THE STORY IN CAMPAIGN IS GOOOD
1:51 that piano
Yes back to halo2 drop pods
This was badass
That pod drop and the music just hits perfect.
I kinda just shit my pants I can’t wait to play this game
A huge part of me wishes Spartans were real cas I feel like there would be world peace and I really wanna be one
Who would wear a bright orange vest when trying to be stealthy
Aahhhhhhhhhh this is so awesome!!
This was absolutely amazing.  A new look.  More lore.  Beautiful, and this is just Season 1.
THE FUCKEN CHILLLS
I thought that the little girl was the little girl from the phones in odst for second
Finally 343 you're getting it
What does this have to do with multiplayer though?
SO EXCITED!!!!
“Folks need heroes.”
Are those Spartan III's from Gamma Company? That fits the timeline with Ghosts of Onyx for them to be showing up during the invasion of earth in Halo 2, but I hadn’t heard their involvement mentioned before.
Old Spartans don’t die, missing in action or passing the torch to the next generation
when that piano hit tho…
Wtf are you guys hyped about? That was awful
lame
bruh those graphics  are on top
AMAZING
Yo esperando a katarn343: 🤩 Katarn: hoy c come 🤑
season 2 cinematic should feature jun
They bigger, how big they down there though! 🥵
Holy shit
ALRIGHT GANG WE TAKE BACK EARTH RIGHT NOW OR NOBODY GETS TO PLAY HOT WHEELS WITH MY GRAMA
Multiplayer is great and all, and the tech preview was fun, but why have we not seen more campaign??? Heck, I'd take an updated look at the same slice of gameplay we got at E3 2020 at this point. How's Craig's face looking? What about that pop in 👀👀👀
Sería un pecado no emocionarse con esto
En Halo 3 el jefe maestro se chingo solo a 1 pelotón de Brutes sin sufrir daño y aquí 4 Spartans  vs 4 Brutes sale uno Herido 👎🏻
2 days before my birthday.... ultimate gift 4 this year
Good to see that even in the 2500s, during an alien invasion, Big Ben still stands.
Who ever catches this comment and is trying to land the Infinite Series X, go to your local gamestop and pre order it there. I put my down payment towards it and I had the staff there confirm multiple times that this won't get canceled and that I am locked in for whatever shipment my local store gets. They said worst case scenario would be not being able to pick it up in store on the first wave but when the next wave comes in, its mine. I myself cant believe how smooth it all went and am still suspicious if this will work since it's not even listed on their site yet but the staff received an email about 20 minutes before I arrived with the SKU number for pre orders. Good luck Spartans
OMG this looks awesome
I came my pants
This song is...
YESSSS! Cant wait to be called trash by kids literally half my age
That… that was Halo
💙 *tears* that was f**king dope... 😭 I love it. 👏👏👏 💙
The human touch of spartans, how I love it ao much in this trailer!
" Why are you here ? " " TO GIVE THE COVENANT BACK THEIR BOMB "
Was that Noble Team?
The Spartans to her were like dad's to a 5 year old
Full Game They will be out until This novemeber 15 2021 and Xbox controller will be out until December 8th
OMG!! I love this trailer 🥰🥰
WHOA LONDON
Hear that? That's the sound of every halo fan being hyped
If you volunteered to be a Spartan, you aren't one.   Brought to you by the Spartan II gang.  Also, people are actually crying over this cinematic? God, I just cannot get excited for this game for the life of me. I had the same instinct about Fallout 76 and Cyberpunk. We all know how those games turned out, let alone how their launches were. I loved Halo, man, I really did. It's gone the way of Star Wars and Marvel for me. Corporate greed and poor choices pave the road to dead franchises. The last real Halo was Reach. If Bungie isn't on the box art, it's not Halo. Bungie died off too, what they get for signing up with Activision to make boring looter shooters and chore simulation games with a cringe fanbase.  Time to go back to playing games released before 2013 I guess. Bummer.
WE WUZ SPARTANZ
So if this is during the human covenant war, why is literally everyone in this using post war weapons and gear?
i couldnt stop smiling whent eh drop pod hit the ground this is making me very happy
AHAHAHABDWNMms dnksnz..sznmemsmwmz.msmd elwmsznnsj, znxmamxmend IM  PUMPED!!!!!!#?@?, A
IM GETTING GOOSEBUMPS
Literal goosebumps. That's how I know this will be good
That use of the piano. . .Just a chef's kiss.
YES
The spartan had a huge hand
I was 300 so away from the max tier in season 0👏🏾
Just pre installed halo infinite can't wait
1:52 I forgot how large spartans are compared to us mere mortals
I just can’t wait!
The High Charity music was chilling
20 years of Halo, cheers to another 20 years!
This was a great cinematic, but where is the liveaction ones we get every halo? Where is coop?  :(
i got SOME GOOSEBUMPS MAN 🤣
Damn, I wish Blomkamp made that Halo movie
We need the ost!
¡¡AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!! ¡¡SO ASOOOMEEE!!! :")
Goddamn it why more season pass crap?  I hope they leave it all open like they did In MCC
I like the part when the gun shoot
This is fire
That piano will always hit just right 🔥🔥📝
Already pre-installed the game
A mí novio le encantó jsjs❤️
Beautiful trailer,however those can’t be 4s can they?, wouldn’t it be lore inaccurate.
Really hope that's is Johnson's daughter to pass the torch.
It's been too long since a trailer for a game gave me chills like that. Well done! I'm beyond stoked for this game.
Hey everyone, bit of a sin but we're self promoing our Halo inspired game here 😅 so far we have a bunch of good comments/ likes/ feedback etc and people love it! Check our profile to see it!
Okay, this was GOOD
If the Halo infinite campaign does not include odst's in some form it would be a giant missed opportunity.
That thumbnail looks like noble 6
🔥🔥🔥
FINALLY we get a trailer instilling the emotions and pride we got during the originals!!! Lessssgoooo!
I feel like this trailer would’ve been a lot better if it wasnt in London tbh because the banished armor and weapons plus the gen 3 mjolnir armor doesn’t fit the time period for when the earth had covenant forces on it
What is this? There is no flavor, there’s no spices. Where is the chips?
Im shaking.
Awesome trailer! I'm so excited!
So are we forgetting that ODSTs and Spartans are two different things 😂😂😂 what a joke of a revival… power power ranger Spartans
My eyes almost started watering up when that piano comes in
Damn, Spartans have big hands. I guess I should've guessed concerning they're 7 feet tall
Lo ameeeeee ❤️. Esto pinta bueno bueno.
Wow I’m excited !!!!!!!!!!
pls rethink ur decison of not adding the campaign coop i want to play with my little brother.
Is that girl really small or are those spartans (and spartan 4's at that) absolute units?
I'm a 26 year old man and I just found myself tearing up watching this. I'm very excited to play this new series entry.
I cant wait any longer!
Hearing that Halo 3 theme oh my. 😭😭😭
So...what’s the purpose of ODST’s now?
Omg 343 what an amazing emotional trailer bravo. This made me tear up so bad in a good way. Now I really can't wait to play
are these spartan 4's?
So when does the west coast get to play?!
GOD
I like the attention to detail with the plasma actually having some punch as it hit the spartan armor. Like there’s some weight to it as the spartan is getting affected by the hits and he’s enduring it rather than being impervious to the damage  Also love the casual nod to the civilian, like “hey, we’re here now, you’ll be alright”
She is a spartan IV, less children kidnapped and more veterans voluntarily enhanced
Now I want a series of short movies in this style
Looked like odst for a second with the vibe. Gosh i love that vibe.
2:12 how did she grow that much when she is already an adult? I was thinking once you are a adult the spartan modifications onto make you much taller especially spartan 4s
do i have to look for another cicada or is that just an easter egg?
Wow, those graphics are beautiful. We've come a long way from Halo CE, and it's been a hell of a ride
Got teary eyed watching this. Brings back so many memories of playing Halo as a kid. So excited.
T rating booooooo
Teabagging but with actual teabags now
Why are you here? Me: to Protect
Wow absolutely fantastic
That was daaank
2:01 tell me why I got Linkin Park vibes when the music started playing? My dumbass really thought New Divide was gonna start playing
Unrealistic. They need to make it more like the US Military!  "Why skin color is important on the battle field 101"
Multiplayer looks chef's kiss.  Once they fix campaign and forge we're going to have s game truly worth of the title Halo.
The music is absolutely on-point! The tone, atmosphere, timing and punctuation is so perfect!   I got chills when the Spartan reached out his hand to her and those iconic piano notes dropped!
343 forgets that brutes can smell humans from over a kilometre away as seen in the short story in halo evolutions, also contact harvest.
The Halo 3 melody HIT HARRRRD.
Halaa p#$ta  ver#&
Judging by today's political climate and idiocracy, I'm just going to go ahead and assume that she's a lesbian who's possibly a transgender as well.   But what doesn't make any sense is that she can't become a spartan just because she's a woman. Becoming a spartan starts from birth.
Bees! reminds me of when Halo came out and the bees and the RL hunting for clues about the lore of the game.
This is exciting! I can't wait for December!
Those brutes should have smelled her and ripped her apart and eaten her, that's what would really happen. This is cringy.
It’s awesome to see the halo community get excited for a halo again
I love that I find out that is awesome
The spartan helping the injured spartan looks like hes sick of the injured spartan's shit and the injured spartan looks like he just walked out of the bar drunked
0:35 Why are we here? I mean, are we the product of some cosmic coincidence, or is there really a God watching everything? You know, with a plan for us and stuff. I don't know, man, but it keeps me up at night.
Awesome, but London, Earth is occupied during Infinite?? If this was during the war on earth (Halo 2) then its wrong. It would be Spartan Blue team, not the new spartans.
Why bother making new music when they can just milk Marty O’s brilliance from 15 years ago for all the nostalgic marketing?
CHILLS!
Those Spartans clearly weren’t playing on legendary difficulty, otherwise they would’ve used HER as a shield.
4 Spartan vs a squad of brutes, one wounded... weak
YES YES YES YES!!!!
Why do i care for ms johnson more than i do of any character in halo 5
I guess the whole "genetically engineered super-soldier" bit isn't cannon anymore?
And remember, the multiplayer is Free! Which is great, but then you realize it's going to be loaded with microtransaction along with 343 selling the campaign full priced.
That shit bussin bussin
Give us a club errera themed battle pass. 😁
Wow this is gay.
I think Halo Multiplayer would work better as an MMO. Couldn't you imagine exploring huge maps as a UNSC soldier first, and then leveling up to ODST, and then a Spartan. And beyond that you could upgrade yourself with Forerunner gear and give your self special abilities for strikes and raids. We could even build our own forts with forge mode and fill it with soldiers we recruit into our corps and use them to defend your base or deploy them in missions.
garbage
So was this before the majority of spartan 2s and 3s died off? Or those are spartan 4s?
Man this gives me halo 3 odst vibes
Mememememdmeme me moje
I love the music Halo Infinite gonna be amazing I can't wait to play the campaign become Master Chief again ❤
i can watch this over and over, i just love it
Why is it Xbox always thinks we all wanna see the cut scenes only when everyone knows we all wanna see the game modes and multiplayer  this video ain’t show us shit
Wait a second....when is this a flashback to? Because armour inconsistencies aside why are Spartans fighting brutes in London before the events of Halo 4?
Really curious of the lore behind this
Damn… that one of the best halo trailers I’ve ever seen…
DECEMBER 8 IS MY BIRTHDAY!!! I hope 343 read this someday 🎈
okay, so, yeah she's cool, but this campaign/ story better not be about someone els like halo 5 was, that was really annoying, we want chief, we want cortana, we don't want to play as someone els like "spartan locke". save those back storys for the comics.
check out the symbol on the left chest plate. Wonder if that means something.
New Co-op mode?
Good to see the S-III’s back in action.
Oh I like her, well designed character!
that was sick and the Spartans look smexy
Am i the only one getting totally bored by this?
That armour and shield design is amazing! It’s like the blend of all the best parts of Reach, 4, and 5’s art styles. And the hexagonal shielding looks so nice!
Not gonna lie, I did get goosebumps. Halo is finally starting to feel like Halo again.
Classic Joseph staten at work
Existen obras maestras, pero esto, es cosa de otro universo, simplemente lo mas hermoso que he visto de halo
Super Ma'am.
Good to see heroism is still in the collective imagination somewhere.
New Mombasa Vibe!! Great to see the place is on Earth!! Great Cinematic 👍.
That was so awesome
Stop I wanna cry now 😭
Deliver Hope
Cringe
OH MY GOD MY HANDS RIGHT NOW ARE SHAKEING I CAND WAIT!!!!
Que pro
Ooh, I really like how they give the drill sergeant some backstory. She reminds me of Sadie.
This brought a god damn tear to my eye
Generic black lady with short hair ugh 😑
Killer of a trailer, not gonna lie.
Over yonder, Spartans.
I thought only the best became Spartan 4s howd she go from a civilian to a spartan 4 leader so fast?
3 days after my birthday!
Yo why do I have chills
I got pure nostalgia feel from this 😄
That's how you do a cinematic trailer
CHULADAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Are these SPARTAN-IVs at work and being trained? If so, THIS is how it's done! No the overconfident, arrogant, and borderline insubordinate fireteams we've seen in Spartan Ops and some other media.
okay that musical call back to halo 3 at 1:50 is just *chef's kiss*
Cinematics look great, but damn: She is UGLY AS HELL.   Tired of this trend of not making characters pretty anymore to appease uggos
I thought Halo was dead at 4, but here it is, alive and well, almost as if nothing ever even happened.
Most candidates died in the Spartan program. Maybe standards have lowered.
Are we going to ignore the fact that this trailer shows Brutes in 2552 using the new pulse carbine?  Talk about inconsistent continuity.
I was expecting maybe Gray Team or Omega Team to come out of those pods. But I'm still happy to see SIVs being portrayed better than they were previously in the past. I get the Guardians from Destiny type of vibe.
Does this mean campaign is getting delayed?
So that’s what 2558 London looks like
it's time to be spartans again!!!!
So I guess everyone can just become a spartan now
*"Ma'am, Yes Ma'am."* And so it's finally said.
0:34   "Its one of lifes great mysteries isnt it. Why are we here? Are we the product of some cosmic coincidence? Or is there really a god, watching everything, yknow with a plan for us and stuff? Idk man, but it keeps me up at night."
This trailer will go down as, ICONIC
The n word has me not excited but definitely still gonna play!
But everything else is beautiful. It gave me reach vibes tbh and a little bit of the odst trailer vibes as well.
1:51... Need I say More. THIS IS A HALO!
I am just gonna butt in and say that the placement of Elizabeth Tower is not respective of its actual placement alongside the banks of the River Thames provided the Palace of Westminster still exists which, knowing Britain, it would.  You know, unless Guy Fawkes the IVth got his revenge or something.
It was a fantastic trailer, but they are hiding a lot the campaign from the game, i don't renember but Halo 5 wasn't was like that, well, anyway, i'm extremely hyped.
343 IF YOU WOULD LET ME PRE ORDER DAMMIT IMMA BUY THE BEST EDITION TAKE MY MONEYYYYY👋👋👋👋👋
Man this trailer fell flat, I mean positively awful. I have low expectations for Infinite, I don't believe 343 learned their lesson after 5
I actually like how similar this is to how in 4 some Spartan 4s will talk to Chief like "hey you saved me years ago, thanks". Kinda touches that new generation of spartans nicely
bro when the piano part from halo 3 theme played bois we're home
Tbh y’all need anime voice actors.
That was kinsano ???from halo wars 2???
Great trailer... but I really want that campaign. That... precious...
"Why are you here?"  Griff: "Its one of life's great mysteries, I mean why are we here?"
Man I really do hope they have some more of the covenant in a different season's trailer
This reminded me of the ODST trailer a bit with the kid at the beginning of the trailer becomes the veteran leading the next generation
:)
"Why are you here?"   It's one of life's great mysteries isn't it? Why are we here? I mean, are we the product of some cosmic coincidence, or is there really a God watching everything? You know, with a plan for us and stuff.
the lore never said they hit London?
I loved it. Every second I was completely hooked.
Halo infinite and spiderman no way home?? Man December boutta be lit
Chills
The design of the human city is just beautiful and glorious 🤌🏼
I want master chief you dumb fucks not some random
Amo Halo, desde Halo CE hasta Halo Wars 2... Sin embargo, pienso que en lugar de añadir a un personaje (femenino afroamericana) bien podrían haber puesto a Sara Palmer o a Buck, es decir, hay tantas opciones ya establecidas... pero la gana de ser "inclusivo"... Halo siempre da protagonismos a mujeres y humanos de todo color, no era necesario hacer esto... pero bueno, mi opinión es irrelavante.... sin embargo ya quiero jugarlo!!!!
I just realized this is London with Big Ben in the background. WOW. Amazing details! Music, characters, hype, all of it - amazing!
We all know waht you tried to do here, the trailer is just awful, why add "wholesomenes" to a Halo trailer, compared to ODST and Reach trailer this is hideous, forced agenda and wholesomenes?
Dude the beginning didn’t feel like halo
Нет уж спасибо, опять 25...😡
Now THAT'S how you do a trailer
Es hermoso
Dude this was amazing, seeing Spartans drop out of space from a drop pod, the tall brutes, this makes me so hyped for infinite!
0:20 was that the minecraft zombie noise?
just a little detail I want to point out is that the first odst drop pod opens at 1:17
This is going to be the best Halo game by far
YES YES YES YES YES YES YES
i LOVE bees!
Loved the beta can't wait !!!!
The music call back tho!!
excellent cinematic was getting me going except for the smile at the end kinda cringy haha
Dios se siente tan desconocido pero tan halo a la vez enserio posiblemenge estemos ante el mejor halo que veremos
This is mass effect andromeda level facial animations
ES HERMOSO !!! T.T
Thought this was a War for New Mombasa flashback till I saw the armor! Still balling on brutes in Human territories I see!
Okay, chills.
Serious H3: ODST vibes from this trailer!
This game better not suck or I will lose hope.
This was very cool! Got me excited for the multiplayer.
SOLO MODE online? Apex squad = bad PlayersPlaystation=TOXIC
I love that the music transitions from Halo 2 (the Convenant invasion of Earth) into Halo Infinite (showing the character as a modern Spartan).
This is so trash.
Damn that was kinda emotional ya know...
1:54 Just look how massive this dude's hand is, like holy shit they nailed the sizes of Spartans compared to your average human
I like it! Wish the drop pods were more impactful however. They're inserted from orbit and can punch thru buildings. Not something you want to stand near!
Mk VII's make me Hot
Why do they always make the Spartans look slow and clunky? What do they not understand? I’ll give infinite a shot. But I don’t have high hopes.
Wow, this looks fantastic
Release the OST plz
Goosebumps everywhere
Chills down my spine. Great stuff
Thank you Blizzard, very cool
Let’s goooooooo official release date
HYPE!
Héroes de Reach ❤️
What a speech!! Can't wait to play this one.
Ya'll dont give me hope this will be like the good old days
I cant call this nostalgic if I didnt hear the menu music in the trailer
Eh, boo.
Where's Master cheif
MASSA CHIEF!
😭
Doom is eternal and now halo is infinite
Oh my god the amount of you all saying looks amazing or gave me chills, it was a cinamatic that showed nothing.  Have none of ypu learnt anything from all the broken promises ftom last decade.
Imagine this bridge or city could be a map for multiplayer. That would be awesome
Why's it gotta be T for teen man....
Now I can dig these IV’s
This puts smile on my face
So what's the timeline here? Obviously Halo2/3 but how come the covenant control London? I say control because we see no real proof of a struggle or conflict and they're going door to door. Also how many spartans do we have on earth during this time now? You'd think assisting John would be a priority no?
First off This is a great cinematic on so many levels. As someone how has enjoyed halo since CE but played mostly reach and h5 I'm super excited to play infinite. Contrasting this is my love of all things halo lore. This looks like a Covenant invasion of earth with Spartan 4's  maybe 3's present? I don't think this is the banished as it would take some years for the girl to grow into a Spartan drill Sargent and humans haven't had contact with the banished outside of halo wars. Anyone got any ideas on this?
Yo I already love that character
Already like her more than Palmer
Can’t wait!!! It’s gonna be lit 🔥🔥🔥
I hope we get trailers like this kinda of quality each season baby!!
THAT MUSICCCCC
Dunno something felt off with this
just like real london
The music is incredible
So hyped
I mean playable brutes would b cool
This gave me Halo 3 trailer vibes, so excited for this game!
1:24 first time in halo cinematics to have a fully functional energy shield
When was London attacked?
Omg trying not to cry when they show who the woman became leading the other trainees, showing the reason why she became a Spartan. BRB balling my eyes out.
I hope there is an Xbox bundle since I still can't find any Series Xs
Es bellísimo 🥺😭😭😭❤️❤️🤜🤛
The camera movement in this trailer is a like a movie. Good job for the camera man I hope his 👌
My only question is what was the Spartan team's mission? The whole city seems to be overrun by Brutes and there's nothing special about this location. The only reason for them to drop there would be to save the girl. That suggests that she was an important figure in the lore before becoming a spartan herself.
DECEMBER 8
AND THE SPLIT SCREEN?????!!!
God Bless you all! Jesus Christ is coming soon! He is about to destroy this world. Please my Friends, all you have to do is BELIEVE in Jesus as Lord and have faith that he died for your sins! The End Is Here! Please, this is the easiest and most important decision you can make in this life! PLEASE, HE LOVES YOU ALL!
should have made it live action like the odst oneee, still a good one none the less.
Imagine if the drop pod hit her
The piano gave me chills
God damn! That puts a smile on my face
Still looks dumb. I’ll pass.
Serious ODST vibes in the first shots. Lovely of them to actually give her a backstory regardless of length. Everything looks so fantastic. Also the release date is almost a month away from the 20th anniversary unlike how everyone speculated, maybe they did it to use that timeframe to bring Co-OP or Forge? Highly doubt it but that extra month has to be spent on something.
SO EXCITED!!!!
The lore brutes would have smelled her out before she got within 20 feet of them 0/10  It has a little something for everyone
Te amo mucho 434 industries 💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚
After Halo 5 I looked to things like 40k to find cool stories. Now it's really cool to come on back to this years later
why do these trailers keep making me tear up lol the minute the spartan drops to save the day and gives that head nod im like HELL YEA
Halo is BACK!
Seer in apex has moths, this spartan has a moth as well? Both are African american? Whats the trend? Is there something I dont know lol.
“We are Hope” “together we are unstoppable” in the times we are living I needed this. So amped to join the fight again.
omg. this comes out on my birthday.. .... ...my life will be complete.
That music is giving me goosebumps, man.
The "Halo Infinite", "Plasma Gernade" sounds dull, & not enough cues that it is what it is. No crackling electricity before the explosion, no high click cue when it lands, no rising shriek before the explosion. And No roaring thunder after it's explosion.
Imagine at 1:53 she gets a 360 no scope from an elite JAJAJAJJAJA
Where can i pay for this
This was pretty good. But lot's of little details could've made it much better
GOD my hype is through the FREAKING ROOF RIGHT NOW!!! HYPE 1000% RESTORED! CHILLS BRO CHILLS
me recordo mucho a Sadie Endesha ( de ODST) que buen trailer!!!!
I came, i saw  I came again  My pants are now white
Im so hyped for this game, holyyyy this looks so gooooddddd
I hope they will leave us add a symbol to the armor as she did
I’m so confused tho 😂 the flashback is making no sense unless I missed something the convent never occupied London. They only touched down in Africa. Anyone got a lore book I missed?
Is that Sadie?
1:47 holy shit you guys actually animated her *PUPILS* dilating
One of the coolest things i've seen in a long time...
DECEMBER 8 LETSFUCKINGGOOOOO
Love how the Spartan was injured. Kinda shows that our enemies aren’t just idiots like they were in halo 5 cutscenes
... That's one of life's greatest mysteries isn't it.  Why are we here?
Damn, Halo always gets the water works going don't they!
Yeahhh a subpar halo game!!!
woooooooooooooooooo
I hate seeing Spartans limping and being carried by another Spartan. If a Spartan needed help walking it would be because their leg was blown off.
I’m hyped!
that was so nostalgic for the pods to come down
Ok so can someone actually answer this to me This clearly takes place in London. So does this take place during Halo 2’s campaign when the Covenant attacks earth and then we fast forward to present events?   But if it’s set during Halo 2 time how are there numerous Spartans?   Or does ALL of this happen after halo 3 and she just aged like 20 years in a matter of days   And if that’s the case when did the Banished attack earth? Since all of halo infinite has been all about a new halo ring nothing about earth   I am NOT criticizing the trailer. This is one of the best trailers I’ve seen in a long time. I am just genuinely curious about the timelines here
Great Trailer!!!
Supreme
Cool to see London, I believe we’ve only seen Sydney and New Mombassa on earth in Halo
Chills, all I can say
Still no coop
The new spartans: Struggling to deal with a couple of armed monkeys  Chief in 2552: Hey what up today I just dismantled the covenant, single handed the flood and destroyed installation 04, where´s my new armor?
Why wasn't this at gamescom? Getting the suspicion this stuff is to cover for the lack of any news or gameplay in regards to camping
Not gonna lie. The multiplayer having a story line is lame.
The girl kinda reminds me of the girl from the ODST audio logs.
She looks like a man when she’s a Spartan. If only there was something they could do for the female Spartans in game model that would let me know if it was actually a female or not. Hmmmmmm
That's what am talking about 343.
damn good trailer, though at the end, the motion animation for the spartan breifing the soldiers was a bit unrealistic. Still, bloody amazing.
People hated on Halo 4's intro that 343i used wrong armor on Spartan-2s armor during Covenant war in Halsey interrogation scene. Here they did the same and used still Mark VII armor in such big flashback but  it seems fine?
yewww black female trope
Already looks pretty WOKE
Wow
So, are these spartan III's? I know the armour is new, but it I guess it wouldn't be too farfetched for it to be prototypes. Kind've like how the Mark VI helmet was in Reach.
Who else realllyyy doesn't care for this character
HUGE ODST VIBES AT THE START
Perron 😎👍
Absolute garbage
When the halo 3 music kicked in I came in my pants
Super neat. Some great simple backstory.
Bring it!
Ngl this trailer was sick. Very happy to see the classic armor appearance return. It looks so damn good.
heroic
so not only did sadie make it out of new mombassa she became a spartan
I cant wait to play it myself when it launches, im holding onto that pre order though
great hype trailer but not much info about game
That piano hit my soul ♥️ . Halo is back !
Gonna be a good christmas!!!
It may just be just me but I’m getting some Sergeant Johnson vibes from her
I needed this trailer after the dogshit Saints Row reveal.
This will be fun B)
I'm still angry about the cooperative campaign!!!
We have cinematic intros now?!?! Kudos.
Why did I almost cry?
What does this have to do with multiplayer?
WOOO  WORT WITH ME MY BROTHERS
Yo me engranoje
I'm excited, yet apprehensive. This better not be a let down
It would have been better if they released infinite on November 15th
great trailer
The first part reminds me a lot halo odst
Showing 4 spartans in some PvE area video while the game has no co-op on launch. Showing no campaign gameplay or even 1 second gameplay on the old Xbox One systems. F2P is the most important thing now. Awesome. Unfinished mess incoming.
What happened to white people? Did they disappear or something? Seems like every movie and game cinematic trailer they’re no where to be found. Are they endangered? Are they the minority now?
This new commander is very cool
That was straight up dope just have too say. This game is gonna be sooooo amazing can’t wait!!
Can’t lie this made me tear up LOL
YESSSSSS
the brutes and the city completely odst  feeling
This is what halo needed. The universe, its people; and most of all everyones story. It fleshes out what halo could and should be through the books and the games. Infinite is looking up. Especially if we get stuff like thais.
Omg this gave me the worst cold chills (or best?). This is so awesome.
Still no forge and coopm on release. So much for the promise that every new halo will have Coop ...
I already like her better than palmer
GOOSEBUMPS !!!! 😲😲
I love that they’re using the Halo 2 drop pods
Does anyone else think that the commander is the same girl that allied with Virgil in the halo 3 odst audio logs? I do.
Love you 343i <3
Absolutely fantastic trailer, really showcases how empowering and motivating the Spartan presence is
Good damn trailer but now I’m hungry for another halo game in the same style as ODST.
halo is dead for me, all you soyboys can keep it's corpse.
A la mierda tilín!!!
20 years later I'm still here. Can't wait for this next adventure. <3
This is actually the first really good representation of SPARTAN IV to me ! In this trailer we can really see that they are far mor human than the previous generations (SPARTAN II were born out of mortal trainings and modifications, III out of desperation and the previous).  I'm Hyped for the futur of Infinite !
Its okay
Man, those 4 Spartans who saved her are probably dead
Plot twist: She is Jhonson dawghter
Eso sí es podeeeer
This trailer was severely cringe. If you can’t see it then you’re lying to yourself
She’s a really bad voice actor
YESSSS!!!!!
She sure loves bees!
If you liked this that fine, but if you talked shit about 4 and 5 not being halo like and are praising this, yikes.
This look lit as hell really can't wait to get this game
When is this set??  Is this Banished or Covenant? I'm leaning towards Covenant - the colours, the fact that the girl is Spartan veteran and trainer in multiplayer which is obviously MANY years after this event... But the Covenant never got to LONDON did they??
“Why are you here?”  “To defend humanity, whatever the cost.”
Had a limited edition series x in my cart and it didn't process 😑the pain!
Wow, if only 343i would actually do Spartan II’s in their armor and not in the new stuff. They just make these videos more confusing lol  Same thing with the Halo 4 opening. They just magically changed all the armor of the Spartan II’s. I’m honestly starting to think they have something against them lol
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA MEUDEUSSSSSS
God that piano at 1:51 gave me chills
Honestly i was kinda hoping Commander Agryna was Sadie from ODST. The trailer really gave off odst vibes to me.  (i know Sadie was from New Mombasa and it looks like Agryna is from England)
Are those Spartan 2s in the trailer? I always prefer their armours more uniform look than Spartan 4s honestly
Most epic cinematic trailer so far! I'm so satisfying with Halo Infinite flight. I can't wait to play this game! I'm sure we will have a good holiday this year!
What year did that flash back take place? It looks like the invasion of earth but there are spartan 4 .
That head nod was EVERYTHING
I’m concerned. What are those Spartans names?. The ones that saved her.
the bees are back
The soundtrack alone sold me lol. God I’m so happy halo is back, and that it sounds* like halo.
Halo is BACK
I can't wait when this comes out
This just makes me want a new ODST game even more.
LES GOOOOOOOO
As a stand alone comment, why the hell could the brutes not smell her! Couldn’t get past that the entire trailer. At least keep it the enemies lore accurate Goddamn.
Don't buy games that aren't finished, guys. They hype you and then don't give you the product
I cried this is incredibly beautiful, nostalgic and inspiring oh I cannot wait.
Am I the only one who felt nothing?  What is even going on?  What planet is this? When was it?  I'm getting old I think. 😪
Great stuff, but this looks more like a campaign cinematic than a multiplayer one.
Do really expect me to play at launch when there's no Co Op at launch. Seriously all the shit with this game I can't even imagine what they planned to give us when they were planning on releasing what they the the Launch of the new XBox. I've defended 343 time and again. But this develope has shown, they really don't know how to make a good Halo. When co op does come out ima just play it on game pass and dip. I was excited for this title and now I'm not.
The size of the Spartans hand was EGGGAR
2:11 Spartans are Litterly walking tanks😲
I really hope they don´t screw this game up and realease it when it´s not even finished.  (I hope it´s not gonna be hyped and end up like Cyberpunk)  And then after 1 month people are dropping because they´ve failed with so much stuff. They need ranking systems, tons of armors and feutures for the players (like in csgo and lol, dota) to make it even more competetive. It´s the last Halo game so you better do an face reveal on Spartan 117, then you´d be the most legendary game company so far.
Ufas
IM SO EGG SITE DEAD
everything looks brand new, like dust Doesn't exist in this world🤣 This really Does not look like a world who have been through a war, haven't u learned anything from plastic guns from halo 5 343i huh!.
We need to more Xbox
YES MAM!
And just like that, Halo is taking over the spotlight
Campaign god dammit. WHERE IS IT???
yeahhhhh thats pretty halo to me
I like how it showed Spartan 4s as a bit more kind since they are usually these annoying cock mfs
Beautiful!!, just beautiful!.
Will this be in the game on launch? Or is it coming months after?
STOP UPLADING 21:9 CONTENT WITH BLACK BARS. HOW IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST CORPORATIONS TODAY STILL MAKING ROOKIE MISTAKES LIKE THIS. ULTRAWIDE MONITORS EXIST. NOBODY WANTS YOUR STUPID BLACK BARS ON THEIR SCREEN.
Even the Covenant appreciate our British landmarks respect to them  Also my hope on the game started to dip but this spiked it up to "hey I'm so hyped"
nah she was so fuckin dead
I know this is random but...   Man I'm trying to get a Girlfriend for like the longest time, I'm already in Junior Year. I at least want the experience before I graduate and enlist into the US Marine Corps, there's this one girl I like, just met her 2 days ago, we hanged out in the morning before classes started, we were really conversation and she's always interested in conversation.. It's been great and I'm feeling confident for once in my life, thing is I'm always askibg my friends for help on what to say because I'm so insecure about myself despite that I'm not bad looking and I'm fit, I just have a hard time talking with women and making a move.  I asked her for her number like an hour or two ago over Instagram, she said "911" lol, but anyway I don't know anymore I'm giving up trying to get a Girlfriend.. Sorry for all the ranting lol
That Commander reminds me of Sadie Endesha from Halo 3: ODST's audiologs
Me me me pick me
Horrible voice actress... Woke nonsense... Why is her facial structure like a man?!
I miss the old Kanye
that classic halo theme 1:50 <333
Delay the game.
NGL, hearing the Halo theme brought a tear to my eye.
hope i can get a series x till december...
Generic black girl hero activate.
Weak sauce, why use brutes but take away everything that made them scary? Like what happened to marines pinned and hiding in the mud while being tracked by animal like enemies that could smell them sweating in fear? ODST trailer was much better at showing a civilian becoming a soldier. Are we going to get a generic action game with halo skin just like this trailer seems to represent?
When he put his hand out for her🔥🔥
Literal goosebumps
0:34 “why are you here?” OMG!!! XD
Were it so easy..   Awesome video cant wait to see where the game goes with the lore.
Three months left, no extra campaign info but some weird cgi teaser and "limited edition" on XSX and controller. Nicely done, 343.
Amazing!!!!
welp at least there is Finally a release date, we have waited for an infinite amount of years. lol
That was cool keep it up 343
So much for brutes being known for their sense of smell, also wish I could tank fire like that mans got the overshield. Beautifully animated though.  "Commander Agryna knows firsthand the difference a Spartan can make" yet despite the great job of the animation and sound teams whoever wrote the scenario for this trailer did a poor job showing that. I'm hoping this doesn't mean what it implies too, that she went from random civi to spartan.
My nostalgia is so damn high I cannot wait.
Yes a live trailer dope as frick
Yo is that a bee necklace? ilovebees anyone????
I really don’t know how I feel about this seasons thing, but in very hopeful. Just please don’t do any and I mean any cross over events with another game. Halo is its own game and we don’t need any fortnite skins or even cold wars events going on here lol and when are y’all going to finally give us a real trailer  like there’s only been one good trailer and that was the one everyone said had really bad graphics. Other than that there hasn’t been one good trailer.  Where the trailers at 365, and bungie. You’ve had us waiting for more than long enough now!!
He didn't hear her trip because of the loud music :(    0:59
Halo is returning hopefully back and better like the bungie days I like the theme of this game so far
The storyboard artist and the script writer for this trailer need their wages halving 🤣
UNSC propaganda tbh, everyone knows those Spartans would've been melted by the plasma nade at that range.
105 days from now gentelmen
Slow aim garbage
I always knew Master Chief was a woman of color. Finally, some representation! Thank you, 343 Industries! 😄👍🏿
Contrary to the other comments, this made me immensely dissapointed... I'm not sure halo is the franchise for me anymore.  This feels marketed to a small child, unlike the halos of old that were gritty and dark. This is not something that I would come back to watch over and over like the original series trailers. You could build these brutes and spartans out of legos, judging by the way they look here.  Sadly, this is also the case for the multiplayer in the game, if it was just a trailer it would be alright. Luckily the way the campaign looks gives me hope, but its hanging by a thread. Perhaps I am being too negative or pessimistic. Let me know if you feel the same. Or not, its the internet after all.
That smile correlation at the end tho 💯🥺🤘🏾 I'm HYPE
hermoso no puedo esperar para jugarlo : D
"IT'S MA'AM!"
Spartans coming down from drop pods... BR ?
I like how they depict that Spartans give people hope. The fact she might be a lesser Spartan but she joined the UNSC to do that for others is pretty Admirable this is truly on the Bungie’s Halo cinematic level. Good job 343. I have doubts for campaign but multiplayer will be great I know it.
im excited for the game but idk why the movement of the characters seem slow and sluggish
At first I thought that was New Mombasa during the events of ODST but damn, apparently Atriox is expanding even in the face of Cortana.
That was cool
Wow " Diverse" "Strong" "Woman" has an actual compelling  story... Damn I didn't thought there would still exist people that knew how to tell good stories about characters.. so glad T.T  (just hope she don't get palmered :x)
That music hit me with a lot of memories. Im fuckin hyped!!!
Excellently done 343!! I swear the lore and stories from Halo could be just as infinitely expandable as the Star Wars and other genre-relatable universes like it! I would love to see those other stories!! Can't wait for Infinite! 😁
Hermoso
DECEMBER 8TH RELEASE DATE!!
that was a fantastic trailer!!!! love cinematics like this.
Guess Palmer got sacked? 😅
Amazing Trailer!! It really shows that Spartans aren’t all super soldier there human too! It was great and it shows how massive Spartans are 😂 compared to a normal person.
So many blacks. Too sjw for me, I'll stick with MCC.
Thank You.
1:50 it is time to return.
You can tell they are Spartan 4’s one of them got a limp from just a few apes
I HAVE GOOSEBUMPS, THIS IS SO AWESOME
Hyped Eternal
You know, I would love a sort of Spartan Ops for this game.
This was amazing
CM PUNK RETURNS , SPIDERMAN TRAILER AND HALO TRAILER DAMN WHAT A AWESOME MONTH
Beautiful
History in the Making also the song at the end nostalgia
"Ladies & Gentlemen.... we got HIM"
Wow, that was a really good trailer!
Yes
T for Teen??
Wow a trailer with no gameplay amazing!!!
What is a Spartan? A benevolent pile of secrets?
Helll yesssssssss
This it radical dude
YESSSSSA LETSSSS GOOOO DUDE. AAAAH IM SO EXCITED. That was put together so well and Post rock is perfect for sci-fi, especially Halo.
black girl
yesss
They were on Earth during the occupation of the covenant. I'm expecting ODST Spartans when were Spartans on Earth my guy what the f*** is this 343. Have this s*** link up with the actual story there weren't any Spartans on Earth that set master f****** chief. Gosh!
I don’t want to be that guy, but if the girl in the hoodie is the same as the Spartan IV instructor, then that would mean that her flashback happened during the invasion of Earth in Halo 2-3. Can someone explain why those obviously Spartan III’s are using the Mark VII platform then? Or did I miss something?
Should have used the original MK VI so that it could transition into the Infinite armor.
1:50 Hearing the Halo 3 Tune gave me goosebumps!
Poco menos de 3 minutos y ya me cae mejor que Palmer
Beautiful! :)
Sarah who…..
As a sentient sponge once said, "IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII'M READY!"
Epic
Wish she was white tho…
Why do the ODST pods fall so slowly? They just kind if daintily touch the ground.
I guess plasma grenades were nerfed cause that blue spartan sat right on top of one lol
Am telling u Xbox has a brand new bag. It’s take over season.
1:52 feels good to hear it
I want to play all parts of the series in order to be more listener in this game  I'm just excited about the story, and I hope it's not linear like the previous games , but rather an open world or semi-open world
Spartans meaning hope is something we haven't really seen in the previous two games. So glad they're making it a big thing in this game
The brute chieftains armor is amazingly designed.
My lil pp so hard seeing this 😳
Is that london
No M for mature
ew is this is bri’in
What is Halo Infinite?  Infinite is a symbol. Hope where there is none (especially after Halo 5's campaign haha). In times of darkness, it is hope. And together (the great community)... we are unstoppable!  Are you ready!?  Good. Who is first (to be teabagged)?
Can we get Spartan Ops back???? Something like this would be awesome in Spartan Ops.
It’s so cool to see the Clock tower still in tact even so far in the future.
The head nod... the injured fireteam member... They're making the spartans appear more human this time around in their promotional material. I like it.
How old was she supposed to be before she grew to Spartan height?
Noo more Sarah Palmer, nooo more cringy dialogue, noo more Sarah Palmer cringy dialogue
Awesome trailer, but it makes me wonder this. Agryna is the girl seen roaming the London streets before becoming a spartan. My guess is that this still takes place during a human covenant war, which also means that the covenant were spread far beyond just New Mombasa, and I also take it that this takes place during halo 2, 2552. so that means, that if she got all her training, joined the odst/marines, and was good enough to become a spartan, that means that the average time taken to be a spartan 4, is about 7 years. Not really pointing anything out, just thought this was something I thought was pretty interesting if is all true. (Hell this can take place before that and in a city that looks exactly like london, but who knows)
While people are really emphasizeing how amazing it is to see the Spartan IV's perspective during Halo 2/3/ODST which is indeed amazing, I am mostly curious about those other Spartans. I am curious ehether they are another Spartan II fireteam or more Spartan II survivors since we only know 15 remaining Spartan IIs in service outside Class II which we only know a single member of. Given the bee, I am guessing they are Class IIs because of ILOVEBEES.
omg omg!!! The sound of High Charity theme in the beginning!!!
Goosebumps
Halo has become more cringe than it used to be damn. Maybe it wasn't cringe back then because I was a kid but at least it used to be M for mature. Halo should be more like doom.
Yeah, that sucked and his felt like an overwatch trailer. Is this really the tone of how the franchise is ending? Just take a look at Halo 3 trailer, now that's Halo...
I have Goosebumps so badly that I’m getting them in places I never knew they’d be… Like down south!
If the UNSC Spartan program was real, this would be the greatest propaganda ever.
Campaign gameplay pretty please and thank you
How generic and lame. This made me waaaaaay less excited for Infinite.
gay-lo infinite
The T rating is a HUGE turn off for me when it comes to buying this game
We. Will. See.
song at 1:50 ?
So, yes 343. It would be great if she is related to SERGEANT JHONSON.
Yeah not hyped
What we need is for this to just drop now, there are no good games to play.
We’re getting actual backstory to the characters. Big step up from Halo 5.
Vete alv sale el día de mi cumpleaños ya estoy todo hypeado
Is that big ben? We’ve never had halo set in London before!
Strong black woman! Strong black woman! Strong black woman! Strong black woman!
The trailer is cool and all but I'm still wondering how the backpack she was wearing fell off like that
Halo is love. Halo is life.
Wow women of colour are so strong and brave
Es hermoso!!!
Unpopular opinion:  i miss Sarah Palmer. Her cocky attitude was quite unique in Halo. Everyone is so noble, and humble. Except for Fireteam Majestic that is.
Yessir!
Damn I just busted a nut watching this trailer..... welp better get a new pair of underwear...    Edit: Thank goodness my recommended came in clutch and showed me there was a new trailer.
Chills, anybody else? Chillz broo
Co-op mission on this story by nice 😩👌
The way the spartan exits the pod.. nods ... and then shields her 😍. I also loved getting to see the over shield. As well as the protective human nature. <3
Siiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
The cinematics looks cool but why do they keep devaluing Spartans to just dudes on drugs
We’re getting closer...
I love it! Reminds me of the Halo 3 Pre-launch trailers like the Believe trailer. 🥰 Emotional and really showing the Spartans in the heroic light they deserve to be shown in!
That piano queue always gets me
10/10 Would reccomend to josuke
Imagine a season pass set wherever that is! Kinda like ODST vibes
This trailer made me cry. It's clear that after 20 years the best years of Halo are still ahead.
A masculine strong woman of color that looks like an angry man. It's so brave and bold.
My day was seriously awful, I needed this dearly😭 still salty about delayed split screen and forge but you're clutch 343!
¿Es Sadie Endesha de los audios de ODST?
0:35  “it’s one of life’s great mysteries isn’t it?” -Grif
Think I might be the only person not that impressed/excited by the trailer tbh... looking forward to the game regardless, but not sure about this trailer
YESSSSSSSSSSS ❤️❤️❤️❤️✅✅✅✅ Calling all Spartans ! Calling all Spartans !
No me jodan, estoy llorando y aún no lo termino de ver. Lo mejor que he visto en años
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
I'm so happy for this
I was not expecting this at allll 🤯🔥
Absolutely beautiful, super excited!
🚮
These cinematics do nothing for me. Let's see gsmeplay wtf
Va a humillar a call of duty Vanguard y a battefield arriba halo
I find her voice very annoying. otherwise, great trailer
Anybody else's heart drop and get goosebumps all over their body when that release date dropped
LETS GO BOIS, HALO INFINITE ON DECEMBER 8TH. I CAN ALREADY FEEL THE ADRENALINE COURSING THROUGH MY VEINS!
Wonder if they invaded through the portal?
oh man i really cant wait 4 months thats too long thought it was coming november
Just a comment about the lore, timeline wise am I the only one who thinks it doesn't make much sense for this to be the banished? I mean the flashback has to be after halo 5 and before Halo infinite while the academy scenes should be either just before infinite or during infinite. Knowing that are we supposed to assume that she became a spartan (commander?) trainer which would imply a higher rank of some sort in the time between halo 5 and infinite. If so then how much time is there supposed to be between 5 and infinite. If this is supposed to be the covenant we have to ask when they ever invaded London and why it looks so undefended (and why we see no elites). Just food for thought.  Edit: I know that chief technically became a chief petty officer right after he basically got into active combat but the spartan 5s or 6s should be following more orthodox promotions taking at least a few years to get to a rank where the task of training new Spartans could be given.  Edit edit: Also it is somewhat weird that London is so undamaged, even if we assume there weren't that many defenders left it is still weird that the Banished (or for that matter humanity)  wouldn't destroy a single building in the heavily developed London.
HOLY SHIT HOLY SHIT HOLY SHIT HOLY SHIT HOLY SHIT HOLY SHIT HOLY SHIT HOLY SHIT HOLY SHIT HOLY SHIT
Bruh, she could have walked 10 more feet and she would’ve been crushed by that first pod😂
Yo that’s a release date!
new wifu
This was amazing
This makes me hope for a new ODST like game but where you get to play as your own Spartan in an open world human city. Because we really haven't gotten to see environments like this in halo games since reach
Halo Infinite will be T for Teen?
Seeing that Spartan waiting for her to get up while staying guard of her perimeter. Then the piano tunes.   Only real men shed a tear.
THAT DAMN PIANO!
It’s time to be The Master Chief once more.
Amazing! And that sound track!!
I grew up with this game but I started around halo 2's release. Since then it's been my favorite even if I haven't played Halo 5 as much as I did reach and halo 3, I cant wait I hope this will give me the much needed feel and put me back into gaming like i used to. Cant enjoy it without friends anymore, maybe ill make new ones through Infinite at release.
Thank you 343, for putting in the time to fix the past. I love this game with all my heart Edit: Oh how soon would I eat my own words...
I’m loving the music
New Mombasa looking clean
And here I thought it'd be November 15th because of the 20th anniversary
Give me chills 👀👀👀
I got goosebumps when the first Spartan stepped out of the pod. I’m so ready for this
Lo veo y c obra maestra
please, sir, may I have another?
Halo and Spider-Man in the same month!!! Oh yea…    And God’s birthday.
Any chance we get a call back to Reach in one of the seasons. Would get chills if i heard Winter contingency theme paly in a trailer like this.
is that a brute captain or chieftain?
The chills from the theme when he reached out his hand
$10 that marketing team at xbox made this & 343 developers is just watching it today.
Holy crap. This is hype inducing.
343 gonna force us watch these stupid videos when we try to play slayer like cod???
Halo. It’s been so long since you gave me goosebumps
:o im so proud of halo i mean this look amazing
Lo mejor de este Trailer y los que sigan es que después el buen @Katarn 343 le hará un video de 2 horas
So they barely won against the brutes almost died and this person later became a spartan.
*Insertar frase de Martinolli* Cuantas veces te pedí una 343 tantas veces, he vomitado bilis por ti, se me a caído el pelo por ti, tengo nervios por ti, voy al psiquiatra por ti y hoy, hoy por fin maldita sea apareces 343 Industries!  A pesar de sus pequeños problemas, 343 tiene mi corazón y  gran juego en manos
K that was stupid
so bad
I think we’ve finally come full circle 🥲
AMAZING!!! I HONESTLY CAN'T WAIT TO PLAY THIS! THIS LOOKS VERY PROMISING! I AM READY TO BE A SPARTAN IN INFINITE!
It would be cool to see some of halo reach soundtracks in this
This looks so sick!!!
Nice trailer and finally a release date. But what are we launching with? I'm saving my praise for when the game comes out.
OMFG!
They did that piano thing, neat.
Full price for just campaign and no co op.
I hate it
I still just wanna play now 😆
DOES THIS MEAN THERES A CHANCE THERES A DEFENSE GAMEMODE WITH EVACUATING ACTUAL CIVILIAN AIs?!
Ok, I like
Legit thought that black girl Was Sadie or whatever her name is from Halo 3 ODST
Too see Reach’s armour and weapon style continued in glorious 4K brings a tear to my eye.  We are back. HALO. Is. Back.
Halo make my brain go brrrrr
I'm crying... I missed halo... BUT NOW IT'S COMING BAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACK
This still looks good! That being said... Delay until co-op is ready. At least the campaign since it is already a separate "purchase" from the multiplayer.
Loved the fact they used Drop Pods, I miss ODST's
It's one of life's greatest mysteries, isn't it?
Arghhh giving us some damn good fan service!!
man I'm so excited for this!
OORAH!
This looks like among us
You're a Spartan! She's a Spartan! ...I'M A SPARTAN! Are there any other SPARTANS I should know about?!?!
Time to go PRO!
Ok. That works very nicely. I love it. So nice to see Spartan IVs that aren't giant douchebag fuckboys.
What happened to season 0?
I cried when I heard end the fight
Let’s goooooo, finally a date, now if December could hurry up that’d be great….
Freaking beautiful! I'm already drawn in to this new character and wanna learn more behind her backstory! Unlike *ahem* another certain spartan 4 character...
The trailer looks amazing,but what bothers me is the rating. I mean how does language and blood considered a teen rating? Plus how are they going to pull off the flood without any gore or  Grotest transformation? If the flood aren't going to be in infinite and 343i   retcon the whole zeta halo lore then its going disappoint alot of fans. If this going to be a spiritual reboot of combat evolve then they better keep there promise and keep true to there words. A mature rating has more freedom to tell a more darker and deeper story.
Cool but by the looks of it, that woman clearly need some lip balm
Its refreshing to see a strong, black female character who doesn't seem to come with any of the political baggage that other forms of media shoehorn in along with them.  Other movies and games can learn from this and I hope they do.   We connect with good characters, regardless of colour or creed and thats something alot of people seem to have FORGOTTEN.   If you cant relate to a character simply because they don't have the same skin colour, gender or sexuaility as you, I'm sorry to say that you're the problem.  Why did I write this? Ahahaha
Jesus, they gave this new commander more personality and development in a short trailer than they did with blue team and team Osiris in Halo 5
Amazing trailer!
Please please PLEASE don’t make the only way to unlock armor through the battle pass. I hated MCCs way of unlocking. Give us goals to hit to unlock the armor we like like reach, 3, and 4
YEAHHHHH
🤩😍🤩😍🤩😍🤩😍😍🤩🤩😍😍🤩
Not only was idea really awesome, but why is nobody talking about how AMAZING the graphics of this cinematic were? It’s crazy to think that the gameplay is almost/is on par with the animation. Just goes to show how awesome this game looks
They really just deployed a squad of Spartans via ODST Drop Pod! And the music.... my nipples could literally carve an ice sculpture right now. o_o
2:16 ME! SIR!
Not gonna lie, I didn't love it or hate it... Just kinda meh
Jeuss the hand comparison lol
343 low key giving me hard-ons while I’m at work. Probably something I should mention to my doctor.
Bro this game lets amazing I’m so pumped
ALVVVV
Dang 343 you really out did yourself
The Spartans care more for their own people, than Joe Biden and Kamala Harris does for their own.
Nothing gets the ol’ serotonin flowing like a bit of Halo
I’m wondering… when were the flashbacks set?
I've missed the Brutes.
RIP to blood and dismemberment of flood :(  Here is to 10 more years of halo!
The new overarching game looking pretty cool 😎
Daaaaaaaaamn!
This nearly brought a tear to my eye. Im beyond hype for this game. i think 343 is really gonna hit it with this one.
When i get halo infinite them banished gonna get f u c k e d boi
I am glad 343 finally understand Halo. HALO is Hope. Believe.
I have a theory that she is actually the girl from Halo 3 ODST Terminals who fled city of new mombassa
I must say halo, I thought this was gonna be a bad game but you clutched up, you got chills going down my spine
Cant wait bro! Thank you 343!!
"Again" sends chills down my spine Everytime. Almost like halo 3 when Cortana goes "This, is the way the world ends."
great trailer 10/10 will watch again!
Something I never thought about, that has so much possibility: the Bungie games are nearly a decade past in-lore at this point. Recruits in their young 20s entering the UNSC were still kids when Reach fell, when Earth was occupied. They weren’t even fully adults yet when humanity was nearly destroyed. They literally “grew up” with the events of the original games. Kind of crazy.   Maybe someday in the future the Halo timeline will get far enough along that younger Spartans were born after the war. The first generation in half a century not born into a losing war that seemed to promise humanity’s extinction. They would look back at the events of the Bungie games how we look back at the Gulf War or Vietnam or WW2. That’s such a wildly different perspective than any we’ve gotten form characters in Halo before. Could be really interesting to explore the difference in how post-war generations compare psychologically to people who grew up under the threat of imminent extinction. Having some younger soldiers making light of the war as people tend to do of past events, and then being put in their place by some grizzled old Marine sergeant who fought with the Chief on Earth, etc.
THE HIGH CHARITY MUSIC AT THE BEGINNING…. THE HALO 3 MUSIC TOWARDS THE END. THE CLASSIC PHANTOMS. CLASSIC BRUTES.. GIVE US THIS IN INFINITE HOLY POOP
this is so nostalgic I can't even being to explain how I feel, let's just say I'm crying right now.
Hágame el favor que belleza 😍😍
It’s for Teens???? NOOOOOOOOO
please tell me i'm right when i say those are sparatan iii's (in the flashback) cause the armor just reminds me of noble six.
This trailer gave me chills
Would be pretty cool if that's Sadie
No way no way..... NO FFFFFFFFFFFFFFKKKKK WAY!!!
Amazing trailer! Ready for the grind to begin!
It would have been a bad day for her if one of those drop pods accidentally squished her.
It’s hard to get excited for anything 343 puts out
Donde esta mi jefe maestro v:
This trailer is beyond hype and as a fan of Halo 3: ODST, I can't help but point out the major similarities I've spotted, going in 👌
THE CHILLS
Halo 3 Odst vibs
Awesome and based
A bee involved in Halo marketing? Where have I seen that before..?
Damn that was sick. So far it seems like 343 finally ironed out the tone and vibe
wooo  is perfec
How is this a multiplayer trailer?
This reminds me of the Starry Night trailer a little bit.  Also can we talk about how Spartans have effectively completely taken ODST's jobs? Lol
okay that piano bit from halo 3 will still give me chills.
Halo spartan forever
I love you halo ❤️
Were those Spartan 3s on earth during the covenant invasion? Badass
I thought she was scrawny but then I remembered how big Brutes and Spartans are. Damn that gives visual perspective to what was originally just a description.
Nice seeing the season before we have the game
I'm not crying. You're crying.
343i, can I just say you're just killing it with all this Hype!!!!
Here we go baby!
This is the best trailer for Halo Infinite we've had so far. Goosebumps up and down my body. Get me back in that multiplayer already!
OMG OMG OMG 👀👀
This is going to be the best game ever, I’m so exited, a new generation of spartan OMG THE LORE I CANT FREAKING WHAT
At this point, the game looks like a live action.
This made me cry man
I’m going to cry
Yes, I’m ready! How bout you!?
I cant wait to hear the lore behind this
That must be New London, crazy cool contrast between the super futuristic buildings and big ben
This was.. alright... It could have used some tighter writing. Examples include:    1) Main character should be shown as a young kid vs teenager. Usually people get hooked more deeply when we see children in danger.  2) Scene did not feel dangerous enough. It would have been more scary to see dead and dying people around her trying to help her get away, before she got caught and saved at last second.  3) It's unbelievably cheesy and unrealistic for spartan to turn their back to absorb plasma shots. You never show your back to your enemy in a fight. Real spartan would have grabbed her and moved her behind him while giving supressive fire.  4) Main character deserved a rocky-balboa-style sequence of trying to make it into the spartan program which she would have always dreamed about.
I Can't to play it after all these years.. 😇👍🏻💙
It gives me Halo classic vibes, the art and the music, yup this was good, still not that happy for the leaks and for not having co op and forge on release but I´d be glad if they delay the game again, just for the greater good.
Great birthday present!
Dude look at the Spartans compared to the girl like holy shit those fuckers are huge
Civilian: Thanks do much for lending a hand!  Spartan: No problem, I got plenty to go around.  Spartan’s hands:  1:54
Now this is sparta
This was epic, reminds me when we were in New Mombasa streets as odst Rookie. Downloading audio files
Wish she was Johnsons kid
Афигенно
all fun and games till we get glassed
So are they Spartan 4s or new generation Spartan 5s because 4s look way different armour wise and under armour
Отлично!
The trailer looks excellent and we are pumped for more Season 1 Content!
After 6 long years we finally got it, December 8th. Shoulda done it on nov 15th but still loving it
I think I finally put it into words. This isn't a classic halo game, its the TRUE evolution of halo. It doesn't feel like halo in regards to storytelling but it has soul and passion behind it so I can get behind it.
brutes wouldve caught her dang scent
God please don't let this be some SJW bullshit.
Wrong Armor Style  !!!!give us the halo 2/3 art style back !!!!!!!!
That Was Sick! You know, I really hope I can one day make an emblem that is all my own! That trailer has my imagination thriving!
That piano at 1:51 hits you in the feels every time.
YES!!!!!  I GOT FKN BUNGIE VIBES ON THAT!!!
Anybody hearing that Halo 2 OST in the background at the beginning?
damn... what a trailer.. honestly very well done and up there for one of the best halo trailers ever
🤢🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮
Eww black spartan
343 Knows what the ladies, and men, like.
I don't think I've ever seen a spartans shields flare up from getting hit in a trailer before.
Commenting here because I know this is a thing I’ll look back at
1:54 wtf the hand size comparison is ridiculous.
Woulda been cooler if the spartans were Mk 5's or 4's. It felt like ODST for a split second, and then it didn't.
Brutes seem to have regained some weight. I miss their old hairy look though. Epic trailer. Fantastic lookdev.
Fantastic! Go get 'em Spartans! Love how this cinematic shows the humanity behind the armor, from the quick nod on arrival to acting as a living shield for the refugee...definitely what being a Spartan should be all about.
Wait covenant in London ??? And halo 2 phantoms huh
we missed you Halo, glad to see you again old friend <3
Omg best trailer you guys have made
I’m excited n all for the game but how did this preview the multiplayer at all
“We are unstoppable!”  (One of the Spartans is literally walking wounded)
That piano motif, it actually made me cry.
600 Deslikes by the Reach kids
I <3 bees
cool
Time to fight.
This is an epic cinematic trailer that is most likely a propaganda movie fed to citizens to join the fight.
It will be hard to beat the original Halo games but I think this one will be one of the best halo games in a while maybe even better than halo 3!
FINALLY A RELEASE DATE YAAY
It comes out on my birthday hell yeah
1:51 wholesome
Xd
THE PIANO
Woow que chido
This man's hand HUGE
Am I the only one who got the chills during the entire trailer?
"FOR SPARTANS! Or whatever they said in 300 ☄️
Let’s go baby
Halo Infinite, Battlefield 2042 and Splitgate >>>>>> COD Vanguard 😁
So the little girl in the beginning, who is she?
Here before a Million
Such a fantastic trailer holy shit.
is that an "I Love Bees" reference? holy shit... don't do that.... don't give me hope...
That female spartan is cringe but i love everything else <3
Remember when Spartans were the best of the best? Now they are random people from the streets.
Holyshiiiittttt❤️❤️❤️❤️
O my goooodddd!!! :D
And all of a sudden mainstream gaming wants you to relate to black chicks, because... because.
bri’ish
NAH MY HYPE FOR HALO INFINITE JUST MAXED OUT IMA NEED RIGHT NOW 💥💥💥💥💳💥💥💥💥💥💳💥💥💥
Does anyone know/remember what she is carrying and protecting?! Is this the same girl from ODST but grown up?
What if the drop pod landed on her?
Holy shit that was amazing (fixed statement)
The fans are more interested in brohammer and John
aw I actually like Agryna a lot now, that was a great little trailer
This got me so hyped, I'm really loving the music too.
Awesome trailer now have a full bloody stock of your new Xbox and try and keep the scalpers from buying all the them REEEEEEE.. 2 Hours announced and its allready out of stock 😢
I just download it and now I’m waiting for the release date so I can play it
Jajaja quien más pensó que era halo 3 ODST
This is basically the plot of forward unto dawn summarized in 3 minutes
Ptm march, no tengo donde jugar halo infinite :(
Halo is back, man that music was a perfect combo of halo 2 and 3, and I was getting some ODST vibes as well with the city design
Wow. This was moving. If this is what the game is going to be like, it’s more than worth the wait. Thank you 343.
Fantastic trailer! Was so interested to learn about the new Spartan commander and you delivered a glimpse of back story I love, hopefully it's explored in game or in the books!
When the Spartan dropped from out that pod I got a lil hard not gonna lie...
God this looks like so a pile of shit for so many reasons.
Certified Greg moment.
Am I the only one who feels like that girl who gets saved by the Spartans and go's on to become one herself is saddie from Halo 3 ODST?  Maybe I'm wrong but as soon as I saw her and heard her voice, saddie was the first thing to pop into my head especially seeing as there's only brutes on the ground in a city like New Mombasa.  It would be badass to find out she became a Spartan after the events of ODST!
Wait so she isn’t a Spartan 2? Then why is she like 8 feet tall. 343, lore pls
I mean... This gave me chills like it's SUPPOSED TO and then some! Halo is back!
Top tier cringe.
I literally almost cried heating One Final Effort again.
Female spartan: What is a Spartan?  Me: The first real Spartans being Spartans 2s being kidnapped kids who were replaced by flash clones designed to die with in a few days that left their families heartbroken without knowing their actual kid is probably going through cruel training and augmentations that resulted in the deaths of kids and the family doesn’t know the actual location of their kid despite the human covenant war being over.   Female Spartan: Hey at least we got Chief.   Me: Seems Legit.
Thank God they delayed the game last year
Maybe we can show more races next time bigots
My first reaction - "WTF?! why is Big Ben in the background?!"  0:07
Yes
If the halo infinite Xbox sold out in 1 minute, which it did, how many people pre ordered it? Is there a record or a count? Was it millions?
Beautiful
This trailer made me feel like I've come home, its been so long.
They're no spartans-IIs but they will do.
Almost forgot how intimidating the brutes and other battle bois can look when you're not a genetically altered super soldier.  Holy shit they're massive compared to her and it gives you the perfect glimpse into how scary they can be when you're just a civ. Now I feel bad for all the ODST troops who charge into battle without Spartan or Heavy support.  They all have standard gear too.
YEEEAAAAHHH BABBY THAT'S WHAT WE'VE BEEN WAITING FORR WOOOOOOOO
ALTERNATE TITLE:  How to memory hole the fact the game won't ship with forge or co-op.
Let’s go! I’m so ready
The Spartans coming out of the pods were pretty cool.
Heartwarming and awesome little trailer. The relationship between Spartans and the Public is something I wish was handled more and it's something I appreciated in the beginning of Reach
OHHHHH ME VENGOOOOO
Im happy the power ranger phase is over
Bro...
She’s already more badass than Palmer
This was beyond amazing! Holy damn!!!! HALO IS BACK, YOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!
Yet another boring cinematic cgi trailer.
If people think this looks good then Halo fans must be down bad lol
I am absolutely amazed
1:15 The way the spartan leaves the capsule is so perfect
Cant believe they made halo T for teen again  Also it was cool but the ODST trailer is just a better version than this, the live action one
LITERAL CHILLS GOING THROUGH MY SPINE😍😍😍😍
Omg (⌐■_■)👍
Me gusta el vídeo de los spartan luchando contra el covenan y salvando ha la gente
That music though 1:57
what was the point lol
it was cool until the SJW moment at the end
This is outstanding. This Christmas is going to be awesome.
Yay!! I’m excited!
bungie would be proud if they seen this
Looking forward to dropping in to the action soon!
Always wondered what London would look like in the Halo universe. Big Ben still standing strong
I've been a bit iffy of Halo ever since the disappointment of Forge and CO-OP not being there Day 1 but this trailer (even if only CGI) was too amazing and made me decide to commit to still trusting this new entry
Amazing!! Beautiful!! And Epic!! I can’t say more about this trailer!! I’m a fan of Halo since Halo 2, and see this, makes me feel happy and so hype to have Halo Infinite!! Also this trailer makes me feel great (I don’t know why) but that’s the word. Thanks for this 343 Industries
YES
Was the bee symbol on the necklace and armor an ilovebees reference?
Unreal. This is how you introduce a character. I am more interested in them than any osiris character pre launch.
Cinematics are always the best trailers for anything being announced. We just need more of these cinematics as short episodes or something similar.
Literally one of the best trailers I’ve seen for a multiplayer
HALO INFINITE FINALLY HAS A RELEASE DATE HOLY SHIT YES
GREAT!!!!!
it reminded me somewhat of overwatch since it's similar to their cinematic designs. those spartans coming out of the pods was epic.
Fantastic trailer/cinematic, music makes it feel like home, I'm really excited for this.
A surprise to be sure but a welcome one
Love the trailer but this is canonically bullshit. Those brutes would have smelled her...
Great video but I’m not hyped at all. Please hear me out as I am very civil. 343 industries and halo infinite might slightly and I am completely unsure but it might be the biggest flop in video game history. First and FOREMOST the SHEER AMOUNT of time they have had to develop this game is beyond enough even INCLUDING the lame covid-19 excuse. So why is it so unfinished? What are they thinking when not including forge, campaign co-op, and split screen multiplayer and most likely theater at the launch date? Then they promise time tables of including them in later seasons happening three months between each season. That means we have to wait 9 months for forge to come out. WHY? Why are there season passes and an entire library stocked with microtransactions and yet most of the beloved features that make a halo game ICONIC are being tossed aside for later updates? This is literally turning me upside on the ENTIRE VIDEO GAME INDUSTRY. They do not care about anything other than making money. It is literally sad to see that something I have been able to love since a child is being abused in this way. they LITERALLY almost announced the release date a year or two back when the Craig meme happened. THEY WERE READY TO RELEASE IT THEN?????
This makes me want to be a Spartan.
Wwwwwwoooooooow :0
I like the Spartan 4s now
Chiiils <3
Now finish. This. Fight.
calm down, the game isnt even out yet
I loved the trailer but please dont tell me we have to play as someone other then Masterchief in the campaign again
HYPE
i dont really wanna be that guy but this game is gonna die as fast as halo 5 if they dont release the full game this year. i know alot of you are over hyping this game but they are seriously setting themselves up to fail. again.
My first profile photo on fb in 2008 was MasterChief  Halo is my favorite game Wonderful job!!!! Beautiful ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
my reaction: WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO LET ME BE A SPARTAN IRL TOO
Ahhhhh! Goosebumps!
When those pods came in and the Spartans burst out it felt meaty and punchy, like Halo is supposed to feel.
Do you guys think she loves bees?
Bruhhhh It’s London!!!!  Edit I wish we see more of Earth in I finite one day
This is gonna be amazing
why is nobody talking about the Big Ben?! is this really supposed to be London in the future?
Te amo tío 343 ❤️❤️
Honestly it was a cool trailer but I am a little disappointed there weren’t any ODSTs
Does this mean we will have a mode where we drop out of drop pods?
Time for the generation to be a spartan
Where the fk is campaign gameplay
Agryna: Why are you here?  New Spartan: It's one of life's greatest mysteries.
Halo 343,   Thank you for no forge. Thank you for no co-op.   Thank you, that that game is just made out of bones. Thank you for giving people hope to play the games with family members on one TV again and just give us all the middle finger
Masterful work 343!! I believe in you
Dude, this is so sick...
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Was that Sadie from H3 ODST?
Es hermoso 😭
Oh hello
Brute CHIEFTENS
it looks so good
By the prophets
Better back story then sarah palmers. Also i was expecting some hand to hand combat from the spartans, being they were so close to the brutes🤷‍♂️
That was cool
Damn did not expect to get goosebumps, been a VERY long time a game has ever done that, reminds me of the good 'ol bungie trailers
This is where the fun begins
Hopefully that chick isn't supposed to be a Johnson replacement because she's already underwhelming. Best part of this was the music for me, glad to hear Sacred Iron Suite and Halo 3's theme in there. Hopefully the music throughout the whole game is homage to all 3 games music.
I can only say one thing, it's perfect 👌
the 500 people that disliked are total bitches
And here i am with my potato computer 😪😪😪
ODST vibes
I love u 343i
yes because this is the same type of trailers we see all the time with halo. its alright but it better then warhammer
At first in Mass Effect and now in Halo, why is Big Ben left alone? I'm convinced the only reason why aliens attack earth in games is for Big Ben. That's it. It's the galactic war for Big Ben.
1:51 this is looking really cool!  1:52 HOLY SHIT AAAAAAAAHHHHH
we want coop
Every bit of this trailer was AMAZING. And you can tell that there is a huge story in this little bit of time. The symbolism of a Spartan and the bond between one and a civilian. Even to just the simple nod, offering one's self as a shield, to just reaching a hand out for her. The story of inspiration for the next generation. This is love towards the fans. I can't wait for the release.
Halo ratted T now?
Is that modern Nobel six team
Didn't this take place in Halo 3 ODST?
GOD THE ARMOR LOOKS SEXY
shit brought a tear to my eye, this is what halo is meant to be
Обязательная чернокожая прям вначале ролика, очень толерантненько, спасибо разрабы что не прогнулись
When that drop pod came outta nowhere *LETS GO*
Hell yeah!
According to lore, she would've died from radiation from that plasma grenade.
Bro those are some of the driest responses to an nco ever trying to hype up their guys
I have a tears in my eyes
Black trans??? Suitably diverse??
Halo needs a Dave Filoni and Jon Favreau type the way Star Wars has, to straighten out this Canon and do some real fan service
Absolutely fantastic.
Awesome trailer!  Love this so hyped for halo😁😁😁😁
this is a beautiful trailer
Happy folks seem to enjoy it...I guess...but from a military aspect it came across as particularly weak, there was no thump or cadence to the spartan candidate's, it just felt like if you asked some college kids why they wanted to be Spartans, and only 6? assuming they were whittled down by selection by that point they'd be on fire to be Spartans. Where was the drive, fire, passion to be something great? The trailer was beautiful, the voice acting and writing....not so much.
OMG OOOOOOMGGGGGG QUE PERRON
8 dec
Ooh noice! Loved it
Hype
Granted I'm excited for this game, but I feel nothing watching this compared to the Halo 3 Believe ad campaign.
Es hermosoooo
My god finally! Is Halo back?! After all this time?!
This looks way better than the co-....oh... yeah.
Only thing that felt off to me was the phantoms. Does this take place during H5 because those definitely weren't traditional or banished ones.
Oh my God the hype it's back..  I feel it... in my bones... in my heart in my soul... holy.... halo is back!! This is beautiful.
London under siege 😲 This is getting interesting, amazing trailer.
Looks like the spartan 4s go through an augmentation too, assuming the drill sergeant didnt just have a huge growth spurt
This trailer is so beautiful!!!!
Chills fr
4 spartans to take a few brutes and one still got injured. Heck, even marines could do better. Back in the day a spartan could take down a full armada without breaking a sweat. Only the very elite of the Covenant forces could match them. 😐
God dammit it feels like Halo again!
The music is fantastic. God bless you for listening to our feedback about wanting the original trilogy melodies and themes back! Please god keep Marty’s themes and melodies in halo FOREVER!
Are you kidding me😳🥺 this is the Halo we’ve been waiting for and I’m so excited!!😍
CRAIG looks awesome 🤩🤩🤩🤩
Objectively terrible. Not cannon. And shoehorning black people into it. Sad
The limited console looks so badass but I already have a PC...
What the hands do???? 1:52
Made me tear up with nostalgia
feels like watered down slow moving spartans.
Soundtrack 10/10.
That's some fine fine UNSC propaganda right there! Ooh-rah!
When can I pre-order?
What a cool trailer!!!
Please tell me shes the chick from odst terminals that escape new mombasa the oni women in those terminals that would be so cool
Great.. but what did that Have to do with the Multiplayer? A co-op pve or sumn? Awesome
It’s rated T? Wack
1:54 ok i know spartans are big and buff but DAMN i didn't know they are that buff! lmao
Am I the only one who wanted to see an odst going out of that pod?
AHHHHHHHHH OMG OMG WEEEEEY
0:19 seer from apex legends?
game is so overhyped Halo will never be what it used to be with 343 at the helm lol.
ODST vibes in the beginning
LETS GOOOOO!!!
Remember when Spartans like the Greek ones they are based from had to be trained from childhood. Also how they had to go through unethical genetic enchantments,  a real cool sci-fi element- kids were kidnaped and replaced with tiny life span clones to cover it up - you thought they were meant for the covenant but then realized the true intent was to control a civil rebellion, very few of them survived becoming Spartans which made them special and rare - well if everyone is now special then no one is special 🙃 My Canon brain has to remind me that MC was turned into a recruitment tool and an excuse to kinda forget ONI’s original plan for Spartans. These Spartans are water downed - a Spartan 2 would of made quick work on that drop shown in this trailer solo vs these multiple Spartans against 3 brutes that almost had a casualty.  PS: Halo needs a Dave Filoni and Jon Favreau type the way Star Wars has, to straighten out this Canon and do some real fan service
Makes me want to play reach and dress up as one lol
Really excited for this game as halo is my favorite game franchise but I am disappointed to see they are aiming for the T rating again… I feel like it’s much harder to portray halo correctly with those type of limitations to gore/violence especially with the flood. It definitely gave halo 5 much more of a cartoon type feel to it.
I never play halo before, you say this is gonna be a good start for people like me Anny recommendation???
pretty good trailer ngl, got some nostalgic vibes from the music at the beginning
This put a smile on my face. I can't wait
what are the banished doing in London?
Even this trailer shows the potential for stories outside of Chief. There are so many stories in the Halo universe.  Give me ODST2
que pro
everytime i hear those three piano notes i get chills
Está muy bien echo el tráiler
God the I love bees necklace, chills
I cannot put into words how hyped I am. LETTSSS GOOO
I just hope the game is as good as the trailers. I’m worried we’ll have a repeat of Halo 5, trailers were awesome but the game itself was lackluster
Increíble!!!
HAAAAAAAALOOOOOOOOOO
Literal    nosotros en tiroteo en zona de guerra  mitico.
damn....
This is so Damn Beautiful 😀  Cant wait to jump in the mayhem💪🏾
I got chills I’m not gonna lie to you
And guys... This, this is Halo
Please put lockout and guardian in the game
This is Halo
maaan the post rock take on the theme is liiiiit
Finally I know when it comes this is gonna be my boyfriend's present  I never play halo before but I will start with him   I was going to buy the control too but I think it's out of stock... And it's a bit expensive
No co-op is a let down. We have 4 gamers, 2 Xbox Ones, and 1 Xbox Series S, but can't play our favorite game together in story mode at launch this Christmas. Gotta say, the game looks good. But no elites took away some of the hype, no co-op takes away even more hype.
Is that necklace an ilovebees reference?
Instant ejaculation!!!!!
OMG. Awesome.
this is absolutely kickass, keep doing great 343, God bless you all.
EPIC!
Weeeeyyyy SIiiiiiii
There are only Three  Pros 1 Halo 2 opening cutscene music 2 Classic Phantom sound  3 No masterchief look alike Spartans
Yooooo chills and that music is amazing 😱 omg!!!!!
Unbelievable. This is beautiful
sick
Where is the company's single gameplay?  Why are you hiding the game?  Is it so bad?!
When the trailer has a better story than halo 5s campaign
1:52 made me tear up…
YES! YES! YES! SO EXCITED. GOOD JOB 343! 😁😁😁
So where is the halo multiplayer gameplay??????????
Never been this happy
Amazing
Great trailer! Love the heroic vibes of the spartans going on in this.
Is it okay for a Spartan there? A plasma grenade just exploded next to him
BLM! ma'am yes ma'am I'm a female! Ma'am yes ma'am  I'm being political in a halo game Ma'am yes Ma'am.....
Like the music and all, gives me some of the vibes of the old halo, I think it could have done the halo 3 ODST style though, like the person going through the stuff then transition to the spartan, but that is my take personally
I <3 Captain Bees
Just a thought here, but maybe don’t wear a bright orange hoodie if you’re trying to evade capture
I love it  It made me Cry.
Goosebumps!
She has a prosthetic leg! I want to know the story behind it
New Mombasa????
Seeing the plasma hit the Spartans armor and have him tank it like a champ, best part. Sounds so heavy and tank-like. Love it!!
I like how the Spartans were more beef tank soldiers instead of zipping around like crazy like Halo 5. Really brings it back to the military sci fi shooter vibe.
Omg that was sooo epic!!!!
Es perfecto!
WOW
Can't believe people hought this was live action. The 3D is fantastic but we still haven't quite hit that level yet.
Idgaf about other Spartans I want a good story for Master Chief. Can’t we see some real footage from the campaign or something?
Damn some halo 3 ODST vibes going on I see
Beauty
THE SCORE IS SO NOSTAGLIC AND AMAZING!
Is this supposed to be london? I saw big ben lmao
What is an ODST??!! Basically.
ilovebees
THE MUSIC!!!
That piano.
I don't know when we can get rid of CG trailers in the industry
Aye yo, I got goosebumps and shit
This hit me with some hard nostalgia
Who else got goosebumps
Im so exciting ❤️❤️❤️
Although i dislike Spartans IV a lot, they surely do look nice.
for a second i thought the girl was Saddee from ODST and i was like "WOT!?"
Stg. Johnson's daughter? 🤔
GET HYPEDDDDDDDDDD
I love it its like halo 3 odst
kinda cringe
Where mastr cheird
I don't know what do you think, but for me this feels... odd, ignoring the more than obvious diversity quota, is like, I dunno man, Halo doesn't even feel like Halo anymore, I don't feel the military vibes, it feels more like a generic sci-fi "super hero-like" story than what Halo was... even in this trailer, it lacks what others did have, like that Halo 3 one when we see the UNSC getting into a bloodshed fight in their own base, or the ODST one when we see the cruelty and sad side of what war really is. This speech felt more like a super hero speech than an actual military speech... The scenes; where is the destruction? the fire, the pain, the blood and the despair of an actual war? Is this Overwatch? it kinda felt like that. This is not a super hero story, and Spartans should not be presented as super heroes, but as soldiers. What happened to the Halo I've always knew?
Halo.! Yes.!
Console is already sold out…. Bullshit
Can't wait
Damn, this one hits home. Hope...
When the trailer started I thought: of course she is a black woman, they have to be progressive, it's just gonna be shallow propaganda; but as the trailer went on I started to see that it was an actual character and it made me feel. That's how you do diversity, by making a good story, not a tool for politics.
Stronk wamen of color
Assuming this is during the invasion and battle of Earth, there were no Spartans active but Master Chief (The last Spartan) during that time. Those Spartans were supposed to be ODSTs instead imo.
Amazing
343i, you got my approval :)
"Where is co op summer, where are you hiding it?"
I felt the emotion finally 343 is getting the way 🤌🏼
Ya le quiero poner mis manos encima
Looks great
I love the background music
Yay for more bullshit diversity. I've lost some hope for this game.
Spartan iv or 2 that came out of drop pod
In comparison to the Halo Wars 2 cutscenes this looks so cartoonish, almost as if out of a childrens movie.
holy shit the hype is real
December 8, 2021. I honestly wasn't expecting a release date like that.
I wish it was Johnson talking.
LETS GO!!!!! THIS IS AWESOME!!!!!
🇮🇱✡️💩        Rip halo infinite.
Wow, Spartan IVs are huge too. I didn't think the augmentations made them that tall. This means the IIs are actually gigantic
Rated T? There’s not gonna be The Flood is there 😔
1:50 almost had me in tears
Lunch together? Campaign launches March 8 and mp December 8. Weird how the dude got confused there.
Man now that felt like old school Halo.
I've only seen this girl in three or two trailers and I already like her more than Sarah Palmer
Globohomo, great.
THIS IS AMAZING
The US army should've used this video for their new recruitment add XD
So is that a spartan iv or 2
💕
So apparently I'm the only one who think it doesn't look very good... Well not "Halo-y". It looks like a marketing engineered bastard child between Halo, Spiderman and Fortnite art direction. ODST and REACH live action were far superior too this... Just watch "Deliver Hope" or "We are ODST". It absolutely murders this teaser.  The success of Marvel and Fortnite among young really is ruining a lot of stuff. Halo use to be the trend and its own thing. Now every content looks like they are trying hard to catch up to the trend like grandpa going Tik Tok.
The music omg
Did I just see Noble 6? & is that Kat’s blue armor from Halo Reach? So many questions, and I’m very excited!
Loved the “I Love Bees” callback.  Best ARG ever.
Nice job 343, take our money :D
I love this. Finally, we have spartans being portrayed as they always should have been
What does the symbol mean
Wish those HEV’s hit harder but it was nice to see them
When they showed the drill sergeant is the child from the beginning.. that seriously hit me in the feels. Got me absolutely excited to play this now.
Finally some halo content
Is that London? I love the depiction of Big Ben being dwarfed next to the skyscrapers.
I'm so excited.
Great trailer but where da multiplayer
Craig will be happy 😍😄 looks sick ngl 🔥
Finally a release date! So excited!
Market the campaign damnit
Let’s do it!
Still no campaign update?
How does one dislike this video? 😳
Is That the graphic of the game? 🤣
1:13  despite that I don't think brutes should look like monkeys (Halo 2A or Halo 3 brutes are best), this shot is glorious. I love their armor and I can't wait to see them with the newly added hair. Hopefully, they get toothier mouths too!
10/10
Why does American people worship black people?
Now this is a certified PogFish moment
Am I the only one who thought at first that was Sadie from ODST audio logs?
IM CRYING SO EXCIIIIIIIIITEDDDDD
They're not releasing it on the 20th anniversary.
Still no Co-op campaign at launch 😐
This is just beautiful.
CMON DECEMBER 8TH LETS GO!!!! 🙌🏼
Something about women in drill sergeant positions just isn’t as authentic to me as it should seem…
They should make the militaries ads
LETS GO!!!
Chills man, all up my back and arms. This right here is why I love Halo!
Good vibes ✅ Halo vibes ✅
Now this...this was better than Halo 4 and 5 combined!
Ahh that must be a new running ability in the moving thumbnail for this video!
This is the first time I’ve actually seen the comparison of a Spartan to a regular human. They are massive
-everyone liked that
DANG SON... I got the chills
Jeez this cgi is on another level, i'm super hyped
Uhm. This is the first time I teared up for a 343o halo thing
OMG I LOVE THIS SO MUCH
Who Is ready!?....I AM!!
Too bad brutes sense of smell has gone to shit since halo 3🤣 still a great vid
Umm.. since when did the covenant invade England? Didn’t they only invade Africa?
epic
I dont remmember that spartan augmentations turned women into dudes. The spartan armour adjust to body shape, like a exoskin, Palmer, Vale, Linda, Kat, Kelly kept their female skeletons and muscular structure after becoming spartans because spartan augmentations make muscules denser, bones stronger and all body size increase, but the female structure remain. This woman after becoming spartan just look like a dude.
He'll yes, boots on the ground, sir!
Oh goody.. seasons.. man these never get old in any game ever.
Is this the girl from the ODST audio logs??
Jobs all over the world felt a disturbance in the force, as if millions of leave requests were suddenly filled out in a hurry for December 8th, and were suddenly awaiting to be approved or denied
After seeing the disappointment that was the SR reboot this made my night. Nice to see a Londoner that isn't over the top cockney. Nice to see Spartans as a symbol of hope. Brutes look good. Nice to see The Elizabeth tower (Big Ben) is still standing kind, it's use I would assume as a symbol of hope of new and better things to come just like it is every new years.  Good job 343. Thank you for saving the evening from the SR reboot.
that trailer was great it shows how Spartans are to the people i cant wait for this dec 8 lets get it.
4 Spartans for a pack of brutes is a gross misallocation of valuable resources
I'm not crying... you are crying... 🥲🥲🥲
I'm crying😭 this game is gonna be so much fun 🤝😭😭😭😭
Super cool but I gotta know, the era mixing is just for fun sake, or does Mk VII really date back to the human covenant war?
🥵🥵 Love the lore!!! Can’t wait to play Halo Infinite again!!!
Finally. A trailer that screams Halo
Now this is more like it! Now this Spartan is ready for action!!!
Not only you give us a release date, but a kickass cinematic with clean-looking Brutes and Spartans AND a character that has potential to be very well written?  It isn't even Christmas yet...
I love this trailer I really wish though that these new Spartans would just keep their helmets on. In halo I’ve always seen Spartans as the type to think of their helmets as their true faces.
Finally the release date HELL YEAH!!!!!
1:54 is no one going to mention how BIG that Spartans hands are?!
Good trailer to start season!!
Great job with the trailer!
10/10
From Arstechnica: "'[The campaign] is this wonderful, wide-open nonlinear take on a Halo campaign. It's gonna offer so much more flexibility: take down Banished [enemy] bases from different angles and progress through the game in your own way. At the same time, that's complicated when you think about save systems and all the technology that's needed to drive this nonlinear experience. In a co-op scenario, that's even more complicated' Like the Halo Master Chief Collection, Halo Infinite will revolve around a 'season' philosophy of regular updates, each lasting 'about three months.' Staten says that his team is 'targeting' a campaign co-op launch with Infinite's second season..."  Season 1: The New Spartans train in PvP. Season 2, Spartans charge into their own linear campaign? I'm honestly so fricken down.
I thought that was chief but still an awesome movie trailer
So cool, keep it up 343!
HALO IS BACK
All I got to say is YES.
😍😍😍❤❤❤
Finally a release date! 😲 😲
Literal chills I cannot wait for this game to drop!!!!
I have tears of joy . And can´t wait aymore, I have to play it now. 🥳
This was a fuckin awesome surprise, loved how it felt like something from halo.
Wholesome and cool, I love it
Im a little confused on the time line for the trailer.
Voice acting is pants tho
Now i want a halo stealth game.
I don't even have words for this, I haven't felt this way since I was a middle schooler watching the Halo 3 trailers on the school computers
I'm disappointed that its rated T
Putting a lot into this multiplayer, hope the same energy translates over to campaign
Oh shiet 🤯🤩 can’t wait for this project in come
absolute chills😭
Ah futuristic London, good to see Big Ben still standing 500+ years later (I know it is Elizabeth Tower but Big Ben is more iconic)
Joder qué puto hype me ha pegado éste trailer, Qué ganas que salga pronto.
Stop releasing broken games. 3 steps foreward 43 steps back -343 studios
I WANT TO PLAY HALO INFINITE SO BAD NOW
If this is Earth-London, then they created a plothole
Wait I don’t get it. They’re wearing gen 3 but it seems it was several years ago. Might even be the human-covenant war but I can’t tell.
Awesome cinematic! I loved the human element with Agryna's backstory.
Es... Hermoso...
And sadly when we play, it's going to be a standard run jump and hit game lol moving nothing like a Spartan does in the trailers or books. Bring CES into the game! Combat Evolved System
1:54 The size of the spartan's hand... jesus christ
Its so damn cool and all but that December 8th date though. Sooo long
Can we have blur studios to do it this time...it will be way more epic and beautiful!
The music gave me the chills, and that glare on the visor when they stretch out their hands, it really gives you this feeling of, you are a Spartan, you might usually see Master Chief with these eyes that you idolize him, but a Spartan regardless of it's Master Chief or not, are all a heroes like him
Reminds me of SWTOR, good use of the covenant march
"happy screaming"
i might watch this trailer until halo comes out damn im so excited
chills. so many chills
god hearing that piano after 14 or so years made me tear up
Its a shame it's not 15th of Nov, would've been the best timing, but oh well still so heckin excited!
You still haven't shown any campaign and yet you give us a release date. I now have zero faith it will be good, what the hell is going on?  2 opportunities at gamescom and you didn't show us a single second of campaign footage. Massive fail.
Halo is now like every free to play pvp game. Full of Hollywood cinematic bull that has nothing to do with the multiplayer.
No puedo esperar a jugar, así serán todas las temporadas con un poco de Lore?
should have been on CEs 20th anniversary
Aw man, seems like they replaced Jennifer Hale.
This was badass
All lives matter :)
This is a multilayer trailer aye?
Ugh right in the feels 343, right in the feels
I love u, 343 💚
sheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeesh
I'm so ready for this.
LETS GOOOOOOO
is that an I Love Bees reference in 2021???
Another franchise destroyed by woke stuff. It had to be a Black Female and probably LGBQT+ protagonist who thinks is a deer from an intergalactic pink cow empire.
Pretty cringe
1:19 bad cgi spartan moment smh for 2021
Lmfao i was jumping like crazy when i saw this
Is it Londres with Big ben??
CHUPA RACISTAS DA XBOX MIL GRAU, uma MULHER NEGRA é a protagonista do trailer do multiplayer de HALO!! BLM ✊🏿
1:31 Me running through my door to tell my friends about the Dec 8 release date
HYPED X1000
That character left far more of an impression in this 2 minute trailer than Sarah Palmer did in two games.
This was AMAZIN'...  If this is a trailer for the Multy? I can't imagine the GAME!
It’s in London but the brutes are using halo infinite weapons not the weapons they would’ve used during the invasion of earth in halo 2/3 and the Spartans assault rifles aren’t the right ones either
y cuando vergas llego el covenant a Londres yo solo recuerdo que en la invasión a la tierra en covenant solo ataco nueva mombasa y oxaca.
I don't even know what to say, I got it  BREATH-TAKING
Its that a reference to I love bees???
Damn these cinematics look good
Instant stiffy
"Weather's shit init" -London Brute
1:50 finish the fight
This game is bringing in all the feels! Keep up the great work! Cant wait to play!
Awesome trailer, little too much identity politics though, if any other game I wouldn't play. But, given this is halo, as long as we score high on Metacritic than gayass PlayStation games, I'm content with any pile of shit MS throws at us!
This is going to be the best Christmas we ever had spartans.
They put similar music to the trilogy let's go
Smol ben
ARRIBA HALO INFINITE
Unceremonious announcement 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
This has got me so hype for a revamped version of aparten ops that much more heavily tied in with multiplayer, cmon 343 make it happen
Of course she's black. Racist af against white people
damn imagine the cutseance in this game
Wow. That was amazing. That's how you make a good intro to the multiplayer. Take notes everyone!!!
Let’s go! Release date!
Not to say alot about marketing, but anyone else notice the release date came out after COD Vanguard 's .... learned from Titanfall 2 so Infinite will release for everyone after BF 2042 and COD... cause it's Halo's time to shine.
Will play it since day 1
Half life 3 confirmed
this trailer basically depicts this transition beautifully. all of us CE players welcoming a whole new playerbase to become spartans.
When she said “a spartan is a symbol”   She became iconic
Aren't Spartans taken as children and trained from essentially the beginning of their lives? How could she become a spartan as an adult?
The possibilities are legit infinite with what they are doing with multiplayer. Looks like they'll be having a separate progressing multiplayer storyline, and my mind just got blown.
This is honestly one of the better trailers I've seen for a halo game. Any game really. Very excited for infinite- really feels like so much care and love have been put into it.
Where the hell is the campaign game??
Can someone confirm, is this in the human covenant war or is this in the events after halo 5?  Edit: the London part of the cutscene
amazing trailer!!! but what items does the first season contain?
Looks Awesome... now if only all the content in Battle Pass were unlockable without paying, I would be on board for the multiplayer
I’m not supporting another company that is releasing their game with battle passes or seasons. Enough is enough. It’s time to exercise your right to not buy this game and stop this shitty industry standard. Hype gone.
We getting forge with that right?
¡¡¡¡VIVA AMLOOOOO!!!!
I'm ready, I can't wait! HYPED!
Wtf is up with the janky slow movements
What is this spartan recruitment propaganda.
Yawn......no one gives a shit about the multiplayer, we've seen it so much and played it, give us more campaign like you said....
for sure getting this on by bday cuz my bday is the 13th
Thank god she was saved by Spartans and not Space Marines.
Babe new 343 Halo video just dropped Time to dislike
Absolutely breathtaking trailer! I loved it!
ITT: Gamers when they see a black person
The piano at 1:51 gave me instant flashbacks to Halo 3, good times. Really excited for infinite.
Ok this got me even more hyped up for Halo
Amazing
Agryna is already 10 times better than Palmer
Theme song brought me back to 2007 for a sec😭
Man the hype this game is generating! Could Halo reclaim its title for the number one fps shooter?!
I will be playing this for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
When did the Covenant invade London??? The only part they touch down was in Africa
I got the chills man.
The scorpion is massive. Damn.
This game finally has a release date and the game looks soooo good. The graphics, the animation, but most importantly, the gameplay m. Thank you 343 industry’s
We finally have the release date
Imagine if the graphics looked like this 😳
im extremely hyped for co-op halo . it's been a staple of the game since its first installment of the franchise and if it's not in at launch I will not be buying another halo game in the future , wait until the game is complete to release the game don't put out an unfinished product
You dont have to be a white man to be a hero see guys progression
Just got goosebumps when the music played
This just made me even more excited
Anyone get hella emotional or just me? Been on this for a long time, to make it this far. *sniff*  could make a grown man cry. Now let’s get to owning each other in multiplayer. See you on the battlefield Spartans.
This trailer gave me tears of joys.  Halo is back
No estaba Seguro pero me gusta el rumbo en el que va este Barco.
Cool trailer but nothing beats those live action trailers of halo 3 and ODST
LETS GOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!
She is already way better than palmer
How is this a "multiplayer" trailer? Looks awesome though
Hell yeah! Time to show the banished who runs this galaxy
Hell jumper hell jumper where ya been?
Big Ben in the opening scene is sublime. Awesome to experience the battle for earth as it happened in Britain!
Goddamn!!! Thats was so cool!
Sign me up
"Why are you here ?"  I don't know. It's one of life's greatest mysteries.
ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh yeeeeeaahhhhhh¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡
Looks badass
Solo puedo decir ¡WOW!
*comically sized big ben*
The moment the spartan held out his hand genuinely gave me chills
Doritos
It's cool to see how massive everything in Halo really is compared to a regular sized human
Really good trailer tbh, having the perspective of a civilian watching Spartans drop in pods like angels from heaven to save the day and then going on to become a spartan herself, this gets me hyped for what's to come. I can feel the H2 and ODST vibes throughout the entirety of the video, hopefully those feelings don't stay on the trailer.
the best game, forever!!!
Waiting fir the campaign trailer♥️ date is official though Dec 8 2021
Imma scream without the s when this comes out no cap
When Finish the Fight came in... gyadamn
Anyone else absolutely overcome with goosebumps when the piano riff kicked in as the Spartan reached out their hand?  Absolutely spectacular. I can’t wait
Epic! Can't wait to face you all in ranked!
You do not understand halo died years ago, most of the garbage that plays that shit from halo 5 or wars 2 are pure asshole who has known halo since 5, they really suck but anyway the community shit they have is idiot that is going to buy that garbage that they offer
Bro she’s only up to the Spartans waist omg hahahaha
POSITIVITY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Meh.
10/10
It took 2 minutes and 41 seconds for me to care more for this commander than I do for Palmer.
halo 3 odst moment
That's how you endear me to a new character
those brutes have no awareness
Is that the girl from the ODST audio logs?
Trailer looks good. Lore wise, it doesn't make any sense!
That one little piano bit at 1:55.  Just...a lil tear :')  343, do us proud. Y'all got this. Delay if you have to, I'm excited to come back to the Halo Universe and you guys should have the time you need to get it RIGHT.
The multiplayer better deliver good to make up for the lack of co-op and forge at launch
Un tráiler HERMOSO <3
ODST are so dope

For those saying this ain't canon accurate etc, Spartan 3s in canon were deployed to London in the battle of earth, I'm glad to finally see that finally visualized, the only inconsistency is they woulda had Spikers, Carbines, Brute shots etc rather than the new infinite plasma rifle whatever it's cold but still a cold trailer regardless
I love bees.
I can’t wait
so wait! they're as tall as chief? cuz i thought the new spartans were smaller?!
The only thing I was afraid of was the T rating. Other than that it looks awesome.
WE NEED INVASION AND WAR GAMES THAT PLSYBLIKE MISSIONS THIS IS AMAZING!!!!!
Bro the hype is soooo real right now.
Was that necklace/emblem an ARG ilovebees reference?   It looked like it.
You have smiled at the same time of the capitan don't you?
December 8th, Yeah baby, WOOOO!
Absolutely badass trailer
Que hermoso
Kinda cringe idk why
But what's in her backpack? it feels really important
Nice but alot of this is abit unrealistic like the way they react and move and how is the civilian so calm in this and not sweating and also how do the brutes not notice her when she is running around they are not that dumb
I love bees ;)
That halo feeling is back
I approve
Halo 3 Feels...
This trailer made me cry. Thank you Halo ❤️ My dad who was a fan of the game, would be happy too. He passed away this year due to the pandemic.
No one talking about the release date
Every trailer I see brings chills down my spine. As a 20 year vet(Of Halo) to the Human-Covenant war, 343, you got multiplayer in the bag this time around. Let's see how you can handle the Campaign though
Finish your game
Lol all the super futuristic giant skyscrapes in the beginning and then just regular old big ben
So the big ben is still there
December, so close yet so far
Once again, 343 shows that fans can still animate better fight sequences. Why does it looks like that Brute takes a half-assed swing at the spartan?  And why do you insist on making new characters no one cares about? Sarah Palmer and now this chick. Why is the spartan commander always a woman in 343 games?
Great feels when it shows her past life before she became a Spartan then cuts to her addressing the recruits
Only getting a Solo Campaign and Multiplayer feels slack, like 343 has no ambition
so much time spent on making a city that will never be in the game outside of this cinematic. While coop and forge were given a backseat. This game is horribly mismanaged.
Anyone think that was Sadie for a second? 😅
Wonder if she’s Sarg’s kid.
Oh hell yeah
Good trailer
Hermoso 🤩
these graphics for the human characters is what i've been wanting for the new halo. Not the kind in the initial trailer e3 2020
Now that's how you make the nay sayers be quite! Good shit 343i
halo  infinite december 8 yeahhhhhhhh
She's a lot better and mote likeable than Commander Palmer
This is so awesome. The hype is real!
I need to see more stuff like this
This is what we call an awesome thing.
Meh
Man if only the shields in multiplayer looked like that
As much as it pains me to say this. Cortanas got to die.
.-.
.
Felt like a movie I swear it gets better and better
This was super cool
cool to see cities we know today and what they look like hundreds of years in the future, cool to see big ben is still in the UK lol
Finally a release date
Yo when it comes out my birthday is gonna be awesome
This trailer literally embodies the atmosphere I want from Halo again.
I genuinely thought this was a Halo battle royale reveal. Such a missed opportunity! It would have been the most hype moment in gaming history for me
Te quiero mucho halo ❣️
Im more interested in these 4 spartans and that women than i ever was in Fire Team Osiris.
This is HALO! Beyond excited
I really like the military propaganda feel of this trailer. Really fits well with it being a multiplayer trailer with a recruiting/training theme
I’m happy that I’ll be done with exams that week and not have to be distracted before it I take them
I love the voice actress she’s from Star Wars Resistance!
Just ... I love it  Can't wait anymore
WE got release date too. HYPE!!!
Well color me F@£KIN HYPED!!! Ooooooohhhhhh boy this is gonna be good!!
UUUUUFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
Now that's what I call a damn good trailer!
I'm guessing its the battle of Earth in 2552, because the new spartan commander would have to be a teen at the time, and since its like 2560 now in Halo Infinite, an 8 year gap would still kinda make sense lore wise. Reusing assets from development to represent spartan 2s and covenant brutes.
1:50 this is Halo.
Ahhhhhhhhh😱🤯😱🤯💥💯🔥🔥🔥😍🥰 DIOS MIO DE MI VIDA yo creo que en mi vida pasada fui un spartan porque ESTO ME ENCANTAAA!!!! 😎
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!
Alright, that was pretty awesome.
Yess!! Release date. We are finally closing in to this game's release.
Man that was a fun trailer!
Just adding to the hype!
Ahh ah ahhhhh ah ahh ah ahhhhhh
Se ve piola el juego 👍
Bro is that Nobel team before noble 6 died in the ship? Or am i seeing things
Not gonna lie I have hope for halo
Why the covenant invade london? is wierd to see the big ben (from the victorian era) in the future
I felt that
Is it just me or does the voice acting seem to lack the kind of intensity needed for this scene?
Looks great and all for a CGI story trailer (for MP, which is… odd), but I’m still very upset about the lack of Forge and co-op. Game should be delayed again till spring 2022 for sure IMO.  NO MORE UNFINISHED GAME RELEASES.
is this the girl from the ODST audio logs?? PLEASE make it be
"Who's first?" "me please!" *gets halo infinite flight on xbox instead of pc*
HYPE! 1000%💖
Halo releasing on my 50th Birthday?? HELL YEAH!!
That spartan came out straight guns blazin like for the boyyyys!!!
Firstly, happy for the release date. Secondly, I really wanna know when that flashback takes place. Seeing Big Ben at the beginning would put it on Earth, probably during the events of 2-3, but the woman talking doesn't seem much older during the events of Infinite, so that's like 8-9 years
I like the direction 343 takes with Halo infinite gives me Valorant and Overwatch Vibes( I don't mean gameplay wise but a Story without a Kampaign i think you guys understand what I mean)
This seems more like a Destiny 2  cinematic than a Halo cinematic but I guess that's just kind of the way games are going now.
Very impressed! Honestly. Hope we get more like this!
This is so awesome! Can’t wait to see what armors we are gonna get!
My meat is very hard right now!
YESSSS!!!!
Lol, it is a girl from Halo 3 ODST
Least amount of back story in this whole universe. Hope the campaign is better than this
Spartans got some big hands lmao
I actually teared up, this is halo...
Absolutely inspiring
So much more character in that trailer for the Spartan Commander than Palmer got across 2 games.
I already love her
Spartans never die
Damn it, 343i. Stop pulling me in different directions. How can I be mad at you when you drop a trailer like this? I'm angry that this game isn't coming out with forge and co-op, but I'm so pumped to play the campaign and the multiplayer...
TE AMO MUCHO XBOX  <3 <3 <3
This has to be how Halo 4 should have portrayed their spartans... being young and defenseless amongst the mists of the war, only to know what stood in their way of loss of hope or acceptance of defeat was a suit of armor that was to defend them and humanity, for which they can be inspired to be all they can be in order to be next in line, to be a Spartan.
Queremos e ver os gráficos dele de próxima geração tá tão feio quanto fortN
Yooo this was amazing
Just with this short video she is instantly better than commander Sarah Palmer.
This trailer is amazing. But I am concerned that no campaign footage has been shown yet.
it feels so damn good to hear the 'end the fight' piano again
IM READY, HOW ABOUT YOU!?!
Hearing the Covenant theme return was way better than I could've imagined.
Big Ben still standing? Well call me impressed!
So cool!
How's big Ben made it there
Is that Sadie from ODST?.
Your enemy can't kill if they are dead!
"You don't have the fan loyalty to fight Overwatch sir."  "No, but I got the funds"  "Oh shit, wait...they killed themselves"
See this is how you make a new character, you made me feel for her 100x more in 2min than you did for sarah palmer in 2 games. The little touch with her necklace painted onto her armor at the end, yeh i felt that, nice touch.
Is that caboose??
Tis is Beautiful!
THIS TRAILER HAS GOT ME PUMPED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
343: here’s a free multiplayer and we’re gonna charge you 59.99 for half a game that’s actually just an early access single player campaign but it might be better 6 months after release...
hmm... well i guess Halo's dead :/
Wey no mames este trailer me saco el pedo de la emoción, esto se va a poner cada vez más bueno
Uffffffff!
Only a half game no co-op campaign no forge and more they dont say
This feeling….is it hope? Or is it happiness, or both?
cool
1:52 this scene is great because I just like when spartans get humanized
If the spartans are that big, how big are the doors?
I ain't forget about coop 343
She sounds like the big vampire lady from the new resident evil
I have no words. Thank you 343. ❤️
The first word that comes to me, Believe.
So there going to do like a spartan ops kinda deal with each season? thats a great idea. Great trailer btw
I thought that was Sadie at first.
I love bees!!!
Awesome trailer. Super hyped and can't wait for more!
Sweet trailer! Is this the girl from the ODST audiologs?
YES, WE GOT A RELEASE DATE!!! Also, now I want a multiplayer game mode where we go and attack conquered planets that the banished have overtaken
Am I the only one confused by the fact that they’re in London? Loved the trailer though,  just when was there a brute Force in London? Unless I’m wrong and that’s not supposed to be the Big Ben
This is cool but next time use lore accurate Spartan armour. I love seeing older armour like mk. IV and mk. V
fantastic Trailer, only whing thats kind "wrong" about it was the music in the beginning iIrc its the theme of High Charity/The Prophets but that doesnt even fit Halo Infinite. correct me if im wrong
Can we get a Halo movie in this animation please?
Reminds me of ODST
Seidi endesha ??
new mombasa?
Halo reach
This is great in all. If this was the covenant war on New Mombasa (Halo 2), instead of Mark 7 spartans. Be Master Chief, now that's Halo.
I'm coming from the emotion, how exciting 🥵🥵
Let's just watch it one more time, what's the worst that can happen
That dood got big hands
Way better then the Saints Row trailer that was shown
"Togevuh, we uh unstoppaboo!"  My lord. Why Can't the English Learn to Speak.
Well if the lore's taught me anything, they were actually sent down there specifically for her, and immediately kidnapped her against her will to enlist after this scene.
8th December release date???
To bad that this is intended to non loyal hardcore gamers and it's intended for Fortnite loot playing millennials. RIP halo , I'll just keep playing the original games. Will no longer buy halo or play infinite.
I am excited, yet still waiting.
Wow thats actually sick
I was so stoked I didn't notice they dropped the release date at the end XD
"You ever wonder why we're here"-RvB
still a better story than halo 5's campaign :v
When the spartan held her hand. CHILLS By the way, the beginning felt like she was the girl from the audio tracks in Halo ODST. Anyone has some lore behind her?
I quit the stream and I've just been watching this.  Man I wanna see a campaign trailer! Imagine if Masterchief dropped there
Time for Crusade! Suffer not the Xeno!
Though the years we've seen a bit of a drop... But it wasn't over... I've been saying I think we're just getting started...but now it's time to get... NO we will drop feet first into hell and battle the Banished and show them we are humanity and nothing can stop us... SPARTAN'S ARE YOU READY?
Hell yeah! The hype is real!
The Cinematic trailer looks awesome
This got me so hyped, and if you look at the part where the spartan grabs her hand, her hand is so small compared to a spartans
Me too I want to be a Spartan !
This short trailer shows 343 finally figured out what it means to make a halo game.  The heart, the spirit.  I hate that I have to wait. But by the gods is the wait going to be worth it.   This is going to be an amazing experience
Firstly This Looks FANTASTIC. Secondly i CANNOT WAIT For THIS To BE RELEASED ON DEC 8th WOOOOOOOOOOOO LETS GOO SPARTANS TO FRONT LINES THE BATTLEFIELD AWAITS
okay so that was awesome
W LET'S GO FELLAS W!!!!!!!!
Why they make anxiety moments like those when the girl looks in a very obvious way that she can be seen for everyone of those brutes. But it's okey, at least those spartans are looking good.
Already more connected to this character than Osiris Team
She already has more character development than anybody in Osiris not named Buck
NGL that spartan fight with the brut could have been soooo much better
The fans to 343: Did you do it?  343: Maybe  Fans: What did it cost?  343: We will see.
What if they make a halo game set on earth?
*sniff* *sniff* 343, you made us proud
This game is about to have the sickest firefight settings if we get stuff like this as a setting
Damn well done
Ptm ya antojaron
The depression is hitting knowing I won’t be able to play season 0
Stupid and cheese... 😒
Holy Sweet Jesus.... that is exactly how you advertise!
december....
This isn’t London. This is New London!
Here before this video ends up on trending.
What is Microsoft wanting to make a HALO CGI movie?
Those piano keys give instant goosebumps
It’s be dope it that was the girl from the subway in ODST
2:27 [Saturated shots] THERE IS A RELEASE DATE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This new soundtrack is just soooo good.
THE PIANO MUSIC
I loved this cinematic trailer. in truth halo is returning to being halo.
Fantastic idea to give the training commander a little backstory here.
At first I thought this a new spiderman game until the brute arrived
IM NOT CRYING YOUR CRYING! Its finally coming, Halo is on its way!
Where's the split screen/Co-Op?  You guys aparently had time to add those stupid AIs and spartan chatter, the battlepass and sell the colors as "Skins"  but not the Co-Op. I won't give you a single penny until the Co-Op is added.
Yep👍
Yo they are going so all out with this! OMFG.
Woo!! Hell yeah! I love seeing Spartans being the everyday hero!!
johnson wannabe
T rated, again...
How come their wearing mark VII armour? If this is during the invasion of Earth 2552, surely they’d be wearing Mark V or VI variants?   Trailer looks awesome though, I’m proper hyped for this!!
"Why are you here?"  "Its one of life's greatest mysteries, isn't?"
Noice ;)
Use my replys as a "I have preordered the game" button
DECEMBER 8TH😁😁😁😁 LETS FUCKIN GO!!!
E for everyone , RIP HALO
Spartans wearing Mjolnir GEN3 in 2552, Brutes attacking London rather than just bombing it from orbit while the ground forces focused on Mombasa and the new Spartan instructor was only a teenage civilian 8 years before Halo Infinite?
Heeeellllll Yeeeeaaaahhhh!!!
Honestly after having a hard time getting hyped for any games this year, THIS is what I've been waiting for. I hope that there will be a good spartan ops mode with a decent story.
Ouu gimme that
The music in this trailer feels so much like Halo 2. Reminds me off missions where you play as the Arbiter.
Is there a release date yet???
Hyped but not for the T rating
Plot twist: She is Johnson’s daughter Also I’m surprised Big Ben would still be around in 2552, considering this must have taken place when the covenant invaded during Halo 2
Yes!, finally a release date!.
Pfft You think you can win my heart back with a pretty video?      Yes. Yes you godamned can
Great artwork and cinematography. Can't wait to see 117 in action.
I can't be the only one that for a second thought the blue one was kat
So, i think this is in 2552. The Battle of Earth, so this Spartans have to be Spartan 2. But in that Battle there was not a 4 men team. So if this is Canon, this is the first appearance of at lest One Spartan in the games (Maybe Omega Team + Some one Else like Naomi). I Mean this is London and there are Brutes so it have to be 2552
10/10 cinematic intro
Loved to see the comradery and human nature in the Spartans.  I’m curious though as to when this takes place, due to what is more covenant colour looking enemies (Halos 1,2 and 3), what is most likely Spartan IVs (Halos 4 and 5) and the armour is from Halo Infinite.
Wait so theirs more spartan II's on earth? I thought only chief was at earth and the rest are lost in space
Halo infinite is really close now as it releases in less than HALF of an year
Great trailer but damn if it's lore-inaccurate. Spartan IVs in Gen 3 Mark VII and the Type-57 phantoms all of which are a post-war thing.  Let's just pretend that those Spartans are Cat 2 Spartan IIIs in Mark V(B) armor and those phantoms are Type-52s.
Ho.Lee. Shit.
Is nobody seriously upset that halo infinite is releasing December 8th and not on the 20th anniversary?
Destiny 3 halo guardians infinite looks decent...
I'm excited now 🥵
This is beautiful
1:26. One of the few times we see how shields work for the Mjölnir work.
Operation Infinite begins in 105 days prepare yourselves Spartans Keep your eyes and ears open and increase Training regement. Orah
Isnt this the community that was thinking this game is gonna fail because its not launching with co op campaign 🙄 yall are really toxic
Couldn’t have asked for a better birthday gift 😊
Would love to know when this flashback is taking place.  Pretty hyped though
The Spartan uses himself as a shield and then runs to fist fight a brute chieftain... absolute mad lad
<3
Doesn’t eve look like halo at times, ugh… really not looking forward for this,
Halo is back
damn need 4 spartans to take on 3 brutes?
this is an amazing cinematic
Oh my god that was AWESOME! LETZGOOOOOO
Too bad there won't be Co-op campaign and Forge at launch.
This Is so epic
2 minutes of apparence and i already think this character is 10 times better than Palmer
Awwww T for teen money grubbing bitches
I´m so hyped.I will give up my live for this game
it looks great and I cant wait to see it all in action
rated T?! so no flood?😭  it looks great, I just like the flood and excess blood.
Oof poor palmer and Locke they been the posterspartans for 343 but now it's this lady who has way more personality in a single trailer than the formers' entire existence
i lost the ever living shit of me
Sad to know that the British still exist in the halo timeline, but this trailer is perfect anyway
Now… IS THIS BLUR STUDIO? IF SO THEY BETTER DID THE CAMPAIGNS CUTSCENES!
Hooragh
Holy shut this was amazing!
Too bad those aren't real Spartans. The IVs are a sad joke next to the IIs and IIIs. The Spartan-Is were part of an unrelated program which was retroactively given the name "Spartan."
Am I the only one that’s not impressed by this trailer? Maybe they’d get co-op campaign and Forge done if they’d stop trying to copy the cod/fortnite/literally just about any game with a BR format. Extremely underwhelmed
Aww hell yeah
😍🥰🥳
Se me paro :)
This is why I prefer Xbox 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Apparently I’m the only one who sees this as a bad sign, you’re telling me they can make this dumb cinematic trailer that is essentially pointless and probably took months to finish, but we can’t get coop until 3 months after release, it just seems like the whole focus is on marketing and building hype as a pose to just making a finished game, it’s honestly giving me lots of cyberpunk vibes
Man, this reminds me of Sady from Halo 3 ODST. She did go trough stuff like when she tried to rescue Virgil and escaped New Mombassa.
This truly shows how big Spartans are ._. 1:53
I came
Dapper!
I'd say that wasn't during the occupation of earth, after seeing the the small glimpse of the new shock rifle in the last video the text says "Grunt comms officer, thinking about the other humans back on earth? well i wouldn't worry". perhaps this ties into the fact that earth during the chaos of the EMP from the guardian that is no doubt there. the banished may have attacked earth to great effect. However the age difference of the girl would go against my argument but spartan augmentation does change a lot so maybe I could be right? either way this was really cool to see!
Who here thought this little girl was Sadie from Halo ODST?
I want whatever drugs made her go from tiny little girl to big baddie Spartan.
Wow, will we actually get to enjoy season 1 at launch? Or will that not ship with the game either?
Bro im so hyped
So Spartans where deploy in London on the Covenant Invasión of Halo 2 and 3? This is relate to I Love Bees? Those are Spartan 2, 3 or IV prototipes? I NEED ANSWERS
When the music kicked in when the spartan reached out his hand I had chills I tell you... CHILLS
sure, make some fancy looking trailers. point is, forge and co-op is already not in the game at release.. just gonna feel unfinished
At Tier 100 you unlock co-op campaign
goosebumps finally
So, the origin story of Lady Sergeant Johnson?
This made me cry! I'm so hyped and happy of playing a new Halo game.
Delay the game please. Releasing it with so many missing features is going to ruin the experience
Noble 6
Pónganle un c0nd0n porque se vieneeeeeeeeeeeeee
You know, after some unfortunate news this kind of broke some of the fall for me. I'm hyped again.
This game is gonna be the best fps till the sequel Launches
Anyone catch the bee emblem? Possible reference to the "I Love Bees" marketing campaign for H2? Could be an Easter Egg in there for the eager eyed fan.
Bro YES THIS IS WHAT I WANT, Badass space men being badass and cool
Wenaaaa Chuchetumare!!!!!!!!!!!! Hoy se cena feliz
I’m getting mad halo 2 vibes from this song
Jle veux , jle veux , jle veux , ahhhhhhh j'en ai besoin 😭😭
Can anyone tell me where this fits into the canon? Fully-equipped Brutes on Earth (in London), but with Spartans coming in on drop pods?
The city looks like New Mombasa, I know its London but it gave me some Halo 3 ODST vibes
DAAAAMN!!!!
Brooo I got chills when the Halo 3 theme played when the Spartan hold out his hand for her Soo sick!!!
Sad, on Xbox One 30 fps
Of course the heroes are women.... just like in the wars, they are always up in the front lines
I love how Big Ben has not changed at all
So hyped
Uh. When did halo become a cartoon. Kid doesn't even look real
I did not anticipate a social justice warrior approach from Halo.
music was great! But the action scene was dull af.
You don't realize how Big the buildings are until you see that Big Ben building it's just Ben against those monsters xD
These Spartans actually acts like men this time, Hypee
I'm gonna have to take December 8th off of work now for uhhh reasons
Lmao, in every videogame britts are depicted as africans
This trailer whas epic.
When they drop the game right before finals week 😔
If she was just a few feet ahead she would have been crushed by that drop pod
2 things i want to say 1. Lowkey excited for infinite 2. Mostly better looking cinematic then call of duty seasons cinematic More excited for the campaign
Badass trailer
Bruh that was plowing epic!!! Let’s Geaux!!!
Hype
I got chills.
Now that was pretty cool!
Woooooooh lets gooo baby
The facts that 2 Spartans dropped in to help each other has me so sad about no co-op at launch
More character development in 2 minutes than in all of Halo 5.
I have been there for halo on launch day for every game since Halo 3, but no campaign co op at release? you should have known better 343... now I wait...
Criiinnngggeee.
geeeeez, the game's not even out until december 8 but we already have a season 1 trailer I'M SO HYPED
Got damn it Pavlov, cutting onions when the piano hit.   I’m so hyped for this game! Screw trying to stay calm about it. Halo’s back baby!
we wuz spartans
1:18 i tought master chief came out for a sec lol
Am I the only one who doesn't share the hype about this trailer ?   For me , it looks really bad . Too cliche , everything looks like an ordinary military trailer. Nothing interesting about it
Wow this made me shed a tear, it was so good!
I thought Brutes could literally smell anything?
Everyone. Ladies and gentlemen, mark your calendars for this date, December 8th. Halo and it’s fans is going to grow tremendously for the better.
Amazing! Can't tell if those are Spartan 3s or IVs, anyone know?
Cómo te quedó el ojo !
ALV. Wey che cinematica mamalona. Ojalá el juego no me decepcione.😎😎
This random Spartan commander has more character in this trailer than Palmer did in 2 full priced games
Been a long time since halo made my hair stand up and want to be a spartan again
I preordered the Halo Infinite Xbox let’s GOOOO! It should’ve been green but I’ll take it. 🤷🏽 Who else got one?
Now she has more depth than palmer lmao
I’m pushing the Halo ODST 2 agenda hard now!
STAY CALM EVERYONE
AYO WE GOT A RELEASE DATE BABY
No pero que rikooooo 🤤
Now their posting like the games out already I wish they didn’t the wait and the suspense is killing me
This makes me want a CGI series on the story of a civilian or a civilian family trying to survive amidst the war while trapped inside a city. I.e. new Mombasa for example (could be any city tho)
We know Halo Infinite is gonna be amazing
Epic
Bro that Halo 2 music has me HYPED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
"I'M READY! HOW ABOUT YOU?"
What an insanely good trailer!!
Pls make new movies or Series of Halo!!!
HYPE
This, is the sequel halo 3 deserved. Let's finish this fight.
Epic! If there was one every season it would be even more epic
Imagine if the drop pods landed on her lol
With the hand of the human and spartan alone it just shows how much bigger the Spartans are and know once again deliver hope
Very nice, flashbacks to the human covenant war gave me a nostalgic feeling.
LAME
I am about to cry. The designs look so nice. I love the new look of the brutes! The HYPE HAD BEEN BACK BUT IT JUST GOT MORE HYPED
1:51 that piano notes makes me cry remembering halo 3 god its so beautiful
Absolutely AMAZING
Actually looks real
So... i gues you fixed the Phantom
OMG!!! Yeahhh
Los amor
why am I crying?
All this focus on multiplayer kind of makes me worried about the campaign. We haven’t seen anything really.
"What is a Spartan?" A kidnapped child drugged up and made to fight a rebellion
Well... Sounds like the Spartan IV are gonna get a redemption arc...       ...about damn time
that was awesome 🤤
Holy shit is that London? Awesome!
AMAZING Trailer. We need more Halo lore on real cities, but look at how the UNSC massacred London. I mean, the future would have and obviously preserved the old and historical skyline, it wouldn't look as ugly or whatever the hell this 0:09 shot is.
How does this look worse than halo 2 anniversary 😭
I'm ready! 😁
Ameze
Johnson’s daughter.   Nah.   But what if?
She loves Bees too!
OHHHHH BABY A TRIPLE
This gave me chills! I'm so exited
I didn't know earth was overrun? When did that happen?
Imagine if you start in a drop pod and a intro plays out. Kinda like Titanfall 2.
I can't hear you!
How good are those graphics looking!!
This trailer shows everything thats wrong with 343 spartans hahah
I'm ready! Let's finish the fight!
WHY DID THEY NOT TAKE THE SCORPION??  That would have been so cool, plus it would have been a similar situation to the mission where the Chief drives the scorpion to go against the scarab in Halo 2, even there as a spartan he was a symbol of hope
I can be that annoying person who says due to her proximity to the grenades and no EM shielding, she probably has cancer. I can also be the person who says in universe we cured cancer by 2552. Happy Halo everyone!
wait...its london. so this is during the attack on earth after halo 2 i guess?  where are these Spartans from?
Why London looks like Mombasa?
The banished invading London, banished on Earth?!
This is the most halo thing 343 has done since they got the rights to the name
Omg they killing criag nooooooooooo
💚
Behold: London, New Mombasa but blue
This is Halo
disappointing. anyone else?
this is soo good!!!
HELL YEA 343! KEEP IT UP
Even the woke got halo
Bro the Spartans hand was so big compared to hers
oooof halo 2 drop pods but tf halo 5 phantoms
felt like a pixar movie rather than the direction the original trilogy took. dont know if it will fit me
Feels like 2007 hype
Wish that they would have stuck with the November release to coincide with the 1st games birthday but I understand getting the holiday sales rush
For the first time.. in a long time.. Halo.. has given me goosebumps.
Talk about great trailer it made me inspired to be a Spartan :D oh it wasn't suppose to? Well it did and it worked
I’m so hype
Not enough and to late. Pls Finish the Game and pls do it for Halo and the Community. The Last years where to much to take it again
Awesome!
lol so any one can be a spartan now
she will be silvia from the new mombasa recordings, and she turned into spartan?
Ever notice how when infinite fans in, it starts with just FIN 🤔
Again wokenism, wokenism shitting on everything. Of course it HAD to be a black woman
Looking pretty good
Goosebumps, when the spartan put his hand out to the civilian, I love that they're giving character and emotion to the world of Halo
Given with how close those pods were, I wonder how many civilians or friendlies have been crushed to death lmao
i always forget how large the spartans are
Woke? BLM... Americans lol. What next. Cripple fat Spartans.
Ahh yes, there it is. A release date for Halo Infinite. Thank you 343 for releasing it near the end of my school semester.  🙏🏼🎄
They way the Spartan stepped out of the drop-pod and into their armour was super cool
cringe
lol realizing how small regular humans are compared to spartans is funny
Is 343 can pull off a MP story line with seasons and keep campaign story in its sights too, this is going to be a huge shift in Halo.
It’s good but it doesn’t come close to starry night halo3 or deliver hope halo reach
I've rarely ever shed a tear because of YouTube, but this made me want to cry. The music just made me remember everything.
Wow, we're already character building and this is just a multiplayer short
OMG THIS GAVE ME 500% HYPE
Wish it was Comming out sooner but I’ll play battlefield until
wait I thought brutes can smell from like a mile away..
They look like playdoo
It's lovely
Spartan: " *Together* we are unstoppable!" 343i : Sorry no Coop-Campaign at Launch
1:50 AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Wow
Spartan drop pods!!!
Pre ordered
wait a second this isn’t campaign 🥲
I partially expected to see ODSTs in those drop pods, but Spartans are always a welcomed surprise! Bravo!
Spartan 424. Ready for action.
cool trailer
Looking a bit cringe there, careful 343.. :/
The necklace an ilovebees reference?
Well, there's my cue to play through the games again
its so good... this is halo
Excited to play this 😁
Is amazing xd
To be honest I’m a little worried for 343 right now but let’s hope they nail this out of the park.
I want a trailer when they make playable elites
So, no campaign gameplay? Okay.....
At the start I was like, OMGOD ARE WE GONNA BE SEEING A BRUTE INVASION OF EARTH!!!???!!!???!!!???  Then I remembered that we did... Five games ago, and that this is a flashback. Still really cool though
Say no more, take my $60
Woow, Que Buena Cinemática
Wait at the end, is that the release date???
No one gonna talk about how we just got an official release date!?!?
WHY I'M CRYIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIINNNNG!!!!!!!!!!!!! HOLY SHIT
Please. PLEASE. let there be a PVE mode like spartan ops
de los mejores trailers de la vida de halo <3
Those graphics, the cool back story, the badass nod of that Spartan! This is looking hella good!
1:59 Spartan's armor is Brown. 2:03 turns blue
I already love this Character and her origin story
Lovely message and introduction - gives a new character more depth for sure. But if that was 4 Spartans vs 3 brutes and one had to limp away, we need better heroes!
They played the Halo 3 tune! OMFG! This game will be better than Halo 5, cause that game was a joke.
i like it .. but also don´t... G3 Mark 7 in London during the Covenant Invasion of Earth? Yet, a powerful trailer about being a Spartan.
THAT'S WHAT WE'VE BEEN WAITING FOR!
This is the vibe and feel I’ve been missing from Halo! If this trailer is an indication of where 343s mind is on the game. I’m going to be pleasantly surprised.
Soon...
I love Halo, but this is an absolute disgrace. You forgot to turn everyone into apes, 343, there actually were couple of humans in background. Seriously, this is disgusting. If Master Chief wasn't shown clearly as a white man, I think you'd turn him into a monkey too. Oooh wait, you tried to replace him not so long ago, but it didn't work out, because thankfully fanbase still loves Chief, not your blm zoo agenda.
This. THIS IS WHAT IVE BEEN WAITING FOR!
:O LESS GOOOOOO
I like how they really humanized spartans while, also being y'know spartans
AMAZING
So cool
This was a really dope trailer, just wish the brutes gave off the vibe they did in halo 3 but it’s still dope to see them in the next game
looks epic!
The CGI Trailer really looks like a Sony Exklusive PS5 Game. But Gameplay looks like old Xbox One Game. Thats Not funny.
My body is shaking
i love how they are giving this new character a good backstory and relevance in the world
Holy shit Spartans have hella big hands
GOOSEBUMPS, CAN'T WAIT ANYMORE!
Ahhh, I can’t take the nostalgia! I love that ‘One Final Effort’ motif they included when that spartan reached out his hand 👌🏻
Ewww
Yall don't recognize halo 2 the heretic ost right off the bat? It's so good.
@1:51 Hearing those familiar notes.. Hope is the theme, folks.
BLM
12/8/21  Merry Christmas folks.
so cool
This is top tier
Cringe
we got a release date 😭 i’m boutta cry
Finally a halo multi-player that makes you feel like just as much of a spartan as halo CE through 3 made you feel like you are Cheif
Finally. Surprised its not Nov 15 or at least before black Friday. Hyped up tho
Wait, this would be Spartan 5s right?
God this looks beautiful. Nice to see humans are keeping Big Ben around
Brutal
Yeeeaaa booiiiiii
I feel the goosebumps! What a trailer!
Es lo más Épico que jamás había visto neta estoy contando los días para poder jugar Halo Infinite 🤩👏
I wonder if the instructor will be in the campaign at all?
DUDE, Halo is back stronger than ever and I can wait to play it:DDD
2030 gonna have soldiers shouting "THEY YES THEY" to their dangerhair drill instructor. "Ma'am Yes ma'am" gtfo of here lmfao
Isnt the girl too old to undergo full spartan enhancement? Usually really young children etc are they when augmented.
YAAASSSS
YES! Now those look like Spartans!
I'M SO HYPED FOR INFINITE LET'S GO BOYS
Where on the timeline is this if there’s new Spartan IV’s fighting the covenant on earth? And I wasn’t aware the covenant were present in any other cities besides New Mombasa
343 why is the dialogue always so cringe
That was a really frickin awesome trailer.
That has to be like the fully updated trailer
They made Spartans too big or is it just me bc got dang that hand was huge 😂
The new Mk. VII armor is probably one of the best in the series!
Kudos that this wasn't 10 seconds long with needing a few more months to be able to show the rest of the first half of this while the second half comes at the end of next year /s
This was extremely lame lol. Seems like companies and franchises nowadays like to ride on past success and put out lame stuff like this. The problem is also the fanboys who just accept and consume anything just because it’s Halo lol. OG Halo fan here and I remember when Halo was actually cool lol.
Perfection. Apart from not having co op and forge at launch, which to me isnt a huge deal, this game looks like it will be the next halo 3, maybe even better
1:51 Come with me if you want to live.
I like how they had to make her black and a lesbian lol
Chills. Am so hyped.
That's so sick
Epic!
I can't wait
Everything that makes Halo feel like Halo
1:13 Craig got promoted.
I felt tingles, way better than what @hiddenXpeira could give in his cope asmr
1:53 Look at how huge his hand is compared to hers! That's Spartans for ya.
London baby!
Seasonal trails !!! ❤️
Impressive how many tired tropes can fit into 2 minutes and 41 seconds.
0:49 It's a good thing that brute couldn't hear her over the music
Wow this sucks compared to old halo trailers
Love it
We have a date les gooo!
Get back to work on putting forge and co op in.
They honestly _really_ nailed the music in this
is this canon...? and if it is, how?   The trailer show us a futiristic London, and then a Phantom Type 57 and Banshees Type 54 most seen used by the Remanent Covenant in Halo 5, but in this case we see Banished tipe Brutes with pulse carabines... mostly used by the banished army.... but the colors are not red.  What is the event that show us the trailer?.... it its not the invasion of the earth in 2552, because we see Spartans IV with Gen 3 armor, and those began to be manufacturing after 2558 It may be the Subjugation of the earth in 2558 made by Cortana and her arminger army... but why are there brutes instead of prometheans. We see a young comander Agryna, seems like a Teenage, but then, when we see her grwon as a Spartan, she looks like at his 30 or maybe less. Which means this trailer events happened almost ten years ago. But Halo infinite it develops in 2560.   It this what 343 was referring about a reboot? They are gonna restructure the events bofore 2560?  so many doubts and so few answers  am so excited!!!
Let's go!!!!!
I love this
that was absolutely amazing holy shit
in xcloud too ??? I will enjoy halo infinite both on PC / XBOX / AND MOBILE
Halo: Spacekangz
Invasion of earth 2552? Gen 3 Spartans in 2552..?
This game really does give you hope. All the cinematics are really well made
i don’t even know her name but i stand with her!
Loved every minute, every second, hell, every nanosecond of this trailer! Looking forward to this.
I´m so excited
8th December release date?
H O L Y  M O L Y
La campagne solo ont attend encore le gameplay !!! 343 vraiment décevant c'est véritablement une communication malhonnête. 6 ans de développement ils sont pas foutu de nous montrer 2 minutes de gameplay de la campagne solo ce studio n'a définitivement pas les épaules ni le talent et encore moins la motivation pour réussir
So happy
Don't shout while at ease. Bring them to attention dammit!
So..yet again you showed NOTHING about campaign. This shit is getting weird. So much bullsh1t about the campaign gameplay. Yesterday they said that we were going to see some campaign stuff today..and now they showed nothing. This is your last chance 343.
Trailer is looking fantastic!
It's crazy how cool it was to see this kind of cinematic in the Halo universe, but it just works so well
This cutscene has more story than the entirety of halo 5
December 8!!!
Goosebumps
Tbh the one thing I loved about Apex is their cinematics, their expansion on the Titanfall lore has been freaking awesome. Of Halo goes along the route of constant lore expansion, I'm legit gonna cry
December 8th beater not be another delay point or I just may not join the fight if its not then sure ill buy that in the first 5 seconds its out.
I was a little hesitant at first, it seemed kinda like what COD has been doing, but then the spartans showed up.  _Oh yeah!~_
Cannot wait! Halo was my childhood!!! Bring it on!!!
Vamooosssss!!!!! UFFFF INCREÍBLE CINEMATICAS!!!!!! ME FASCINAN!! PARECE DE PELICULA!! ME ENCANTOOOOO MI JUEGO FAVORITOOOOOO SPARTAN!!! 133📢📣😍😎😎😎😎💥✊🏻💪💪👊🍀
💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚👏👏👏👏👏
EPICOOOOO
What do you know, they finally got the spartan's size right. In halo 5 spartan 2s were as tall as spartan 4s
Great trailer. Now will we be able to play against brutes as our own Spartan?
This character is already infinitely more like-able than Palmer
Holy Hype TRAIN
2552 during the invasion of Earth makes the most sense, but then you got the H5 Phantom, HI weapons and Spartans. She looks 20 years older in the present shots, though HI is set in 2560 I believe. Assuming due to limited access to game assets and Spartan augmentation for the drastic change in appearance. Spartans would most likely have to be, SIIIs or Blue team if 2552, but still think that's a long shot.
Claim your "Here before 100k" badge 🤩
Honestly, this trailer does do something to alleviate my distaste for spartan IV's but I still personally do not like the 4th gen as their initial presentation really soured my overall perception of them (except for Buck he really deserved it). Though I would be lying if I said I am not still anticipating the campaign.
The music is.  So.  Hype.
That was…really nice
186 downvotes from people who are salty they can’t play coop on day one…
Campaing?
Let’s go we finally got a release date
Amazing trailer
See you all December 8th.  Hopefully I'll reach 300 subs by then
Take a ticket for the hype train
Was that the lady from the halo: odst phone recordings? The one that tried to reach her father?
All these bullshit games coming out this the only 1 I'm waiting for 😲🥰🌹
What a great way to bring us back to what makes Halo so good. "We - are -  hope." Great trailer.
LETS. FREAKING. GOOOOOOOOO
Love these new spartans! Phenomenal trailer!
Me mie
*YES*
1:52 Thats when the Flood gates broke.... :,)
Great trailer. Didn't realize Spartan 4s were around during the event of Halo 3.
No gameplay :(
Hate that character but ok
On my Birthday!! Holy S
Who else thought that little girl was Saddie from the halo 3 odst audio logs?
Huh, I like her more than Palmer so far
This was so cool.
Nice ILOVEBEES reference 0:20
Not a lot...but fm they did that well
Okay guys hold on- hold on now,  Halo...   Is back 🙏
Holy frikin shit this is one of the best trailers ever
Where Craig?
No gameplay footage of campaign for the entire year of 2021 so far... this is concerning.
That was a snoozefest. I'll just continue waiting for a trailer for what we'll actually be playing.
I'm glad to exist at the same time halo did.
Love it!
As cool as this was. Theres ALOT of lore problems with this is there not
Hype is back in full force.
Just a shame that’s all we go from gamescon, we all got blue balled again lads
Apenas entré y ya están lloviendo vrgazos
Spartan at the end was like “Stand friend, you will not fall today!“
This gave me odst vibes, with the night time city combat against brutes
Oh boy, it's Laurette again.
Yeah im sold
Glad they got the good graphics back
Chills
Does that confirm halo is rated T?
This! This is HALO <3
They aren’t shoving pre order rewards in my face. That’s refreshing.
Gave me chills
halo spartans: viewed as heroes by everyone with humanity   WH40K space marines: viewed as empty precise and unstoppable murder angels by most of humanity with only few chapters valuing human life
Finally a halo accurate cinematic
Aww yeah she's definitely going to be better than Palmer. WHOO BABY WE BACK!.!!;
Damn this XCOM 3 trailer looks great.
She sounds so weak.  I think they need to change the voice actor and gender
EPIC.
That piano ong
"Gotta throw in the token strong independent female POC" said every multi-billion dollar executive from 2020 on
There are so many lore and timeline inconsistencies in here, I don't know where to begin. Otherwise, a very beautiful trailer.
Interesting backstory...line delivery was kinda meh, ngl. Felt waaaay too forced badass. Be natural and own it, don't force it. Better yet, get Laura prepon or letty Ortiz back from the halo 2 days.
BLM.... woke/ SJW infinite ?
Now this is what I'm talking about.
"iT dOeSnT fEeL lIkE a TrUe HaLo"
literal goosebumps. cant wait to play
THIS LOOKS GORGEOUS
This got my blood pumpin
This is great but I hope that ever seasons intro cinematic actually highlights something of story or gameplay and isn't wasting the animation teams time that could be spent on story dlc
It reminded me so much to Saidee, that's how I imagine her going around New Mombasa trying to save her dad.
H Y P E
This gave me goosebumps
Can't wait for that coop campaign experience
Bee!
Hyped for orbital launch day!
Show us the campaign you cowards
EPIC !
I thought this was overwatch
THAT MUSIC THO !!!!!
I know the trailers cool but OMG SPARTAN HANDS ARE HUGE 1:53
I'm pretty sure this takes place during halo 2
i like the fact we get to see a very grimy looking industrial city tho we havent seen one of those yet all the others seem like pleasant places to live minus the covie invasion
Of course it's rated T
Is that supposed to be the girl from halo 3 odst in the audio logs or is she someone else
Actual chills running down my spine.
Hmm ODST drop pods still being used 🤔, maybe upcoming halo ODST game in the future. Possibilities are endless.
YUHHHH
looks cool
I wonder if these are spartan 3's or spartan 2's
Didn't like it. I don't like the forcefulness of inclusion in my games. i guess you can't be straight gamer if the industry wants gaymers.
Okay that was pretty sick. Maybe the marketing for this game isn't that bad
Sooo is December 8th the release date...not seeing anybody in comments saying anything...
Trailer hasn’t even breathed for 1 hour and we got suckers bitching about “FoRced DiveRsiTy”. London is a very diverse place.
Nuuuuuut
That was beautiful
Bravo this single trailer has made cemented her more of a character than Commander Palmer.
Dope trailer, but when exactly does this take place? On earth with Halo 5 Covenant phantoms (not Banished), Brutes, and Spartan 4s in Mark VII armor? Huh? None of that lines up in the timeline I feel like
Caralhuuuuuuuuu
Karalho
IM READY HOW BOUT YOU????
i can't be the only one that thought about sadi at first, with the city being shown off at night with phantoms and brute search parties
WE HAVE A DATE!!!  (finally)
What, so we have date now? Cooooool!
That’s probably her home planet being invaded during the human covenant war, she does look noticeably older in her Spartan armor so time has past since the end of that war. This could’ve taken place on any of the human colonies during the humanities eradication and those Spartans are displaying the multiplayer armor designs for this game so I wouldn’t look too much in to the canonicity of their design but I could imagine this as literal display of how frightened civilians were during the covenant invasions and how encountering a Spartan would leave one in shock and awe, pretty near trailer tbh
Already like her better the Palmer.
December 8 is gonna be wild.
That was unexpectedly sick, I was expecting buck, or the rookie to get out of the pod for a second tho
Oh COME ON!  THAT was awesome!  The face transition was a killer, you guys nailed that one.
A GOD! This is amazing I'm so happy, so happy 😊👋🏾😊👋🏾
Es hermoso!! Perfecto!!!!
Amazing!! So excited for this. Trailer looks great!
OMG WHY AM I CRYING SO LOUD???!!!!
I dont comment on videos very often.  👏👏👏👏👏 This was an amazing trailer.
Folks need heros chief gives them HOPE
The vibe is back, the music is back, the Spartans are back, the saga is back, HALO IS BACK
Props to the design team for London in the 26th century, it looks so cool!
Brooo i just got goosebumps watching this trailer
JUST TAKE MY MONEY ALREADY
That's awesome Spartans 4s are actually acting like Spartans
A Spartan, is a symbol. Hell... and that moment, when he steps out like a boss.
La chica que corre entre las calles , parece endesha de halo 3 odst
The 'I can't hear you' or 'say that thing louder' has literally never been cool. Still hyped for the actual game though!!
Why does this remind me of Overwatch
Looks sick but where´s the campaign?
Doesn't make alot of sense that she was rescued by spartan 4s since the 4s have only been around about 4 years so it would've made better sense to be rescued by 2s or 3s and then show her progression to being a marine or odst looking up to the spartans then getting an opportunity to be a spartan herself because even with the 4s you still have to have prior military experience to become a spartan and once again 343 basically just pushed the 2s and 3s out of the way to focus on the 4s despite many such as myself not liking the concept of the 4s but other than that it looked pretty cool and more halo than 4 and 5
Halo Infinite is looking good!
I cried a little when the halo 3 piano played
December 8th 2021? I think the release date should’ve been November 15th 2021 for Halo’s 20th anniversary but that’s fine
that was the coolest thing I have ever seen.
Nice trailer, hope we get more soon.
Just make a f-ing movie already! 🤩🤩🤩
This was great and nice to see and I know they can’t change this now but was this really worth the time and money over other core features it idk what all went into this but it seems like you guys are targeting what other AAA companies are doing which it’s seemed like you were trying to avoid.  Still thou it’s nice to see that you guys are still out there and also fml I got a final on the release date
It is beautiful ಥ‿ಥ
Big hype
beau putain pourquoi c'est écrit en français ?
Great trailer hope there's more to come!!
Pero qué pedazo de trailer, acabo de llorar de la emoción 😭✨🥰🤩
Typical sjw shit. Miss old halo cinematic.
Goosebumps 😁
The Brute infantry designs in this trailer look fantastic. It mixes Halo Reach and Halo Wars 2’s brute designs while avoiding the overly bright armour colours from the 2020 campaign reveal.
Halo 2 metropolis - Halo ODST vibes
That was amazing! Truly feels like a continuation after the classic Halo era with all respects and credit to 343!
The US ARMY should be taking notes on THIS is how u do a recruitment video  There was inclusion and NO SJW BS
December 8!!! Let's go!!!
I AM SOOOO READY!!
That first spartan is an absolute legend
Love the Spartan Agryna, the vibes she gives, amazing trailer.
Already like her more than Locke. I’m loving the short and sweet backstory. They did the same thing with Brohammer.
Now I don’t get it, are they Spartan 4s? But on earth? Covent weren’t on earth after the battle of new Mombasa right? And during that time Spartan 4s didn’t exist? So it must be 3s? Because I don’t recognise them as 2s and close to all of the 2s we know how they look like suing that time
nice trailer, but i still hope you have made a beautiful campaign
And theres me thinking that Spartans was stolen as kids 🤔
😯😯😯😯😯
I dig it
Those Brutes look awesome!
THIS WAS NOT EXPECTED AND IS TOTALLY WELCOME
Rated T :( Blood :))))))))))
Badass trailer, but honestly not enough. We know multiplayer is good, we've played it.   I just want some campaign footage for a game releasing in 3 months. Show me it's worth $60, please. Last we saw of campaign was a YEAR AGO
What did I just watch? I guess we will see what this turns into. Incredible animations no doubt.
lets GOOO!!!! This getting me pumped for what's next. Damn.
Hype
That spartan with the sprained leg got hurt a little too easy
Is that an I love bees reference when she shows her Locket
<3
this is burning 🔥
I just want to know the PC specs of infinite, this is fantastic.
*But how is she so old when those Spartans are the new Mark-VII for S-IV?*
her having only one strap around her shoulder trying desperately to hold onto the backpack with her other hand instead of just putting both straps on like a normal person annoyed the hell out of me
This is what I have been waiting for. This holiday season is going to rock the world.
So the multi-player is canon. When did this trailer take place?  During Mombasa?  Maybe, but it's set in england.  During halo 3?  No cause there are other Spartans in the new armor.  During halo infinite?  Maybe, but than how did the new lady become a spartan so fast.  I'm so excited yet this question has me stumped
See ya on December 8th!!!!!
This reminds me of the shitty woke army ads.......
I think understand why this 6th Halo game is called “Infinite”  The “fin” in “Infinite” means “end” which means that even though this is most definitely the final Halo game ever, its legacy and influence will actually never truly end nor die. It will live on forever.   In other words, Halo’s spirit will live on *infinitely!*
This trailer gave me chills, i cant wait
This makes me want a seasonal story mode where you plays as ya own Spartan similar to Spartan ops, that would be sick!!
Bringing back that theme of hope we had in 2 and 3. Feels like a return to true halo.
Where coop
viva cristo rey!!!!!
LA HYPE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Voy a llorar
SO AMAZING
I’ve been saving my vacation hours all year just to play this game. I’m so happy I finally have a date to start the great journey.
Simply incredible.
If anybody else here played the test, you know like i do that 343 nailed the gameplay. Now I just hope the story is compelling to match it.
God the shield animation is so good
I think the mark 7 armor is now my favorite armor EVER
Why is no one talking about the release date
This really feels like halo!! I'm so excited to see more of these spartans and how they interact with people.
I’m fuckin creamin rn
Am I the only one who is absolutely in love with how massive the scorpion tank is compared to a normal person. To a spartan it doesn't seem that big, but in this she is barely bigger than the tread. Just love it.
Can't wait
Welcome back
Wtf!!! What happened to 20 years anniversary date?
LETS GO BABY!
Massa chief
Spartans never die
Dec 8th for infinite, or just the multiplayer?
Halo London looks pretty awesome. Hope we can get a map there someday.
And are cinematics going to be in the game at release or...? :P  Joking aside, I really enjoyed this trailer and I love the aesthetic they've created blending both art styles!
OH MY GOD YES
We all lacking on the fact Confirmed release date for Halo?
Imagine if season trailers for the first one “heroes of reach” we just see noble team
Bruh I got shivers
Can we preorder now??
Does anyone else realize how big they made the Spartans? They look actually huge now compared to normal people.
Welp 4 months to go. Glad I got Demon Slayer game and Battlefield to tie me over till then lol
I cried 😩
Chills. Literal chills. Been a while since I was this excited for halo
Noooo why are the brutes hairless
12/8 BABY!!!!!!
Looks like thanks to Cortana's guardians, the Banished were able to bring down many human worlds.
POGGEERS
Cool Ac room 🥶+ Snacks and Juice 🧃+ Full Internet Speed+ Halo Infinite 😇= Now we need to Fight 😭
This looks pretty good not gonna lie.
Yes, more beautiful animations to watch.
I am beyond ready for this game
Spartan dropped with a "sup" attitude let me beat this ape into the ground really quick
Wait Is this a new halo theme... ITS AMAZING
Ah, yes, I was curious what the theme of Season 1 would be. I can now see it is about [strong black woman] which is an important addition to the story and gameplay of Halo, and has me extremely excited for release.
ma'am, yes ma'am???
Halo is back fams.
Teen rating probably means the flood probably isn't in it.
Heyo
Yo do this mean that the fight is getting taken to earth in infinite
dang this is some next level eye candy   I love it
I guess I'm ready to let 343 break my heart again.
Those brutes are blind on god
1:54  Bro that guys hands are massive! Imagine getting punched by a fist twice the size of your face
People want heroes, give them Hope 💕
I <3 bees
Thought she was generic before, but this adds some depth to her. Love the brute designs.
Bro the Limited Edition Console just go sold out after minutes. Dude, why.
So awesome
AMAZING trailer but can anyone explain why there are new gen Spartans during the 2552 Battle for Earth..?
THIS LOOKS GREAT!!! But I kinda hope that we get more marketing before launch
That was fantastic.
There were news articles written about how disappointed people were that infinite wasn't displayed at gamescom, And now look where we are.
no forge or co op play on open world game 60$ where we only got gameplay footage and art design focus on a single part of the whole campaign and although they spent years only making the new slipspace engine it seems they didn't make enough time to make the game and the graphics on E3 release was sad and gameplay is decent really looking scary tbh prolly be delayed till spring like rumors say not relieced for christmas and its T for Teen which succc
"What is a Spartan?" "Ma'am. an immoral Black Ops experiment first created by a convicted war criminal" "I...ok yes what else?
Well it’s T for Teen☹️ but it still looks awesome!🔥🔥I just hope if the flood are in the game they’re not watered down.
Is that it? No campaign footage still?
This gave me chills! Really well done
1:49 This is gonna replace the Mercy meme
This trailer is awesome!!!
My excitement cannot be contained
I am the HYPE! This looks amazing.
This trailer was corny as hell
Dec 8th 2021 Boom
The hype is real.
I'm very confused. Is she a Spartan? Cause The Spartans towered over her, but they are there to become Spartans and are smaller than her. Are they just mini Spartans? Or do they grow?
The only complaint is leave the drop pods for the odst there awesome in there own right....all the awesome vehicles halo has like the falcon could have pulled up and drop them into the fight....still very excited but 343 do drop pods for everything but the odst the brutes have drop pods the Spartans the elite I see everyone dropping but odst ...
HELL YEAH BRO LETS GET THIS SHIT GIMME GIMME
No mameeeeessss 😍
Can't wait to start my journey not only in the multiplayer, but as well in the campaign of *Halo: Infinite.* Great job on this trailer 343i! 🙂👍🏻
Playing the beta had me excited but now I'm super hyped, I can't wait to play again!
Hype!!!!!!!! I'm body needs it!!!
Perhaps during one of the covenant invasions on earth?
YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
'WOKE' halo
Cool, trailer.  I don't think the actress can pull off ruff and rugged drill sergeant, though.
Ok, I’m hype now
HYYYPEEE
soundtrack halo 2 ...later soundtrack  halo 3. Is a mixed of soundtracks halos. Is delicious :P
Save the bees anyone?
definitely is beautiful, I felt almost cry
IT'S SO FUKING BEATEFULL
Though forge or campaign won't be at launch, let's remember that we're waiting for a huge game. The biggest one we've ever seen from Halo. It's ready when it's ready.
Is that the chick from halo odst terminals?
I’ve been hyped for Infinite since the get go but this trailer brings emotions I’ve never felt before. I am so excited for this game
I'm ready,  how bout you?
brutes invade london for bo'lls o' war'ar
Te quiero mucho Halo <3
"Been a long time coming"
Hyped! Let's go!
december 8! here we go boysss
Oh yeah 110% Buying Halo Infinite.
December can’t come fast enough!
So spartan armour makes you twice as tall and makes your hands super big
i came 🥵
No coop or forge but let’s spend probably about $500K making this cutscene 😂😂😂😂😂
BEAUTIFUL
Good shit, honestly really positive about this release
I had goosebumps, loved it !
Hi
It will come out the very same day as my birthday!!!!
TOUCH DOWN, HIT IT BOYS!
Ghost of Reach gave me chills
Best. Default armor. Ever.
Don't put SBMM into Social or you can consider Social Halo being completely chalked.
Noble 6?
no gameplay? hypersad
This gave some chills!
get a better voice actor
How the hell can the brutes not smell her?!
I'm excited but uhhh... where gameplay
1:54 YOOOO THICCC HAND
The fact that we’re seeing more of the free multiplayer portion and not the campaign gives me the feeling that it won’t be that good.
Raaaaarr...
This trailer giving me goosebumps
I think this is one of the best trailers I've ever seen
Some parts tell me this is in engine, but at the same time, cinematic too
Bloody awesome
🥜🥜🥜🥜🥜
The way they are trying to handle seasons feels like Apex Legends and that's not bad at all! 🥰
"SEASON ONE" yessir
I’ve always wanted to see a civilian point of view on the human-covenant war. This right here is what I remember the lore being, Spartans dropping from the heavens and becoming hope. And when that Spartan reached out with his hand…. Chills.
The fact that Big Ben looks comically small is a nice touch.
*Hello there!*
HYPE + The Mark VII looks so great.
So, so hyped. Exciting times
Quite enjoyed that trailer more than I thought I would. I’m ready
I want that controller
They got on the got on the trend of seasonal cinematics
Épico simplemente épico
Was that Big Ben at the start?
Wow, that's awesome! Can't wait. I hope we have some coop multiplayer missions or something of that nature!
Straight up brought tears to my eyes, hats off!
GOOSEBUMPS!
Holy sugar london! IN HALO?
When those spartans dropped in that was frickn sick
2:01 is that an I Love Bees reference?
I'm cying !!
So we're Master Chief floating in space and ejecting ourselves from a pelican into space after being "re-booted", but then we're landing our pelican on a Halo ring, but we're on earth... in the past as a child but then getting trained in the future by what seems to be an angry woke spartan that almost died in the past.   Either 343i story writers aren't communicating with each other over at HQ or there is some serious lore I'm not aware of.  Hmm, if only there was an Xbox app that had a channel that was dedicated to Halo and could fill in the lore gaps and get me up to speed.  You could call it .. Halo Channel.  Just an idea.    Is this going to be another Halo where Master Chief has two missions and the rest is a whole new character that we just can't relate with because of a lack of story building and weak writing ?  But hey, it's got customizable armour and a grapple hook.
This is 343’s last chance to get Halo right and not fumble the property like they did with Halo 4’s multiplayer, Halo MCC’s first few years and Halo 5’s campaign. Can they stick the landing this time after 6 years in development hell, a year delay, multiple project lead departures and missing features at launch? I doubt it but I hope they really nail it. I want Halo back on top and I’m tired of waiting.
Meh
This is actually a good backstory to her. Genuinely impressed.
I just watched this trailer and I am completely convinced that I will love this game
It’s Awesome 🔥 but... Propaganda kill my mood 🤡
This phantom has a beetle design rather than blocky design in infinite demo .  I don't understand
This character is already better than palmer and we’ve hardly seen her except for in these trailers  Also on an unrelated note the spartans when they come out of the pod are using actual in game animations from halo infinite
Wow
she already has more character than locke
Waited Years ! Its Finally Time!
Dope trailer. Nothing like hearing that iconic piano kick in. Always gives you the chills.  I am a little confused about the timeline. Lot's of Spartans on Earth/London when she is young during what I guess is Halo 3/Reach timeframe. Were there fireteams canonically in that period before?   ...  And I just read the info on this video which goes into the modern timeline, wild, Halo Wars 2 is relevant.
Wait wait a min 🧐 this game going to be T for teen not M for mature 🙃 just asking
Damn.
Help, the drop pods
Looks awesome! But how about that campaign?
Pls make a comeback halo
cool but where's my campaign demo?
chingon, supongo que la ciudad es Londres durante la invasion a la tierra en halo 3
Great trailer
Do it for her. *Become.*
Actually.. this is perfect. Wednesday December 8th I'll return to my old ways of making kids cry over the headset. December 9th my girlfriend will begin contemplating our future and how things may have changed for us. If everything works out she'll dump me right before Christmas, which will mean I can forward the cost of her gift to buying a console and this game. Cutting it close MSFT, but I'm optimistic.
What can I say.... I ❤️ Bees
I’m reeaaady!!! How bout youuuu????
WONDERFUL
And the Campaign? :(
This made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside.
THE MUSIC!!!
These MF know how to use the iconic piano at 1:52
They phantom actually looks like a phantom and sounds like one
That halo 3 piano tune just hit me really hard
This already looks better than halo 5 haha
HELL YES!
I appreciate seeing her design going from long hair to having short hair, this is how spartans should be done since they are soldiers and hair would get in the way of gear. (I'm looking at you vale)
Holy shit, 343 did a great job on this. Also, I see we have a release date now. I can’t wait to play this game.
This is in London? Damn big Ben still be there. Is that big Ben?
I pray every single day you guys can manage to give us the game you want to do, even if we have to be a little more patient.  I'm stressed about the campaign, which i hope turns out it will be something really important and epic for the community but for sure, i will be there for the multyplayer.  The thing is: i know you guys are really trying to deliver something really special for everybody and i hope it will turn out like this.  This cinematic gave me goosepumps, i will be there, on 8 December for the multyplayer.  Because Spartans Never Die :)
Its just me, or  the trailer is placed in London?
HYPEEE ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
WOOOOOOOOW
Ahahahah
The cutscene  was really good it gave me new Mombasa vibes, I'm really excited for this can't wait to play it!
I feel like the voice acting wasn’t there but holy shit that was great man.
Sooo...December 8th?
Why is Craig wearing Halo reach Armor? And clean shaved? How many times do we gotta teach you this lesson old man 343 lol
Damn, is that Noble team?
Epic.
More
I'm both crying and nutting at this intro.
MY BROTHERS ,write that date in yours calendars because we are gonna fight like if it was our last day!!!!!
IT'S HAPPENING, EVERYBODY STAY CALM
Man! I'm loving this post-rock music so much!! And that piano towards the end...AGGGHHHH!!!!
Hyped
That was awesome! I do hope this means we'll also see Firefight in the multiplayer as well ^^
show the campaign you twits jesus christ
yoooooooooooooooo, i thought it was sadie from the H3 ODST audio logs :(  Imagine if 343 did that
they will make these million dollar short movies but not co op campaigne
This was amazing absolutely fantastic !
Eso fue hermoso
The casual nod he gives the civilian before killing brutes is the most Spartan thing, I love it Edit: So some people in the comments are saying Spartans would never be this informal. I'll remind you that the first human ever to find himself face to face with the Prophets of Truth and Mercy was John 117. The first word he said in their presence was "Boo."
Original phantom sound
Is that London? siiick
It's so beautiful 😭😭😭
I'm not crying you're crying
YIKES that was cringe. This feels more like Overwatch than Halo. Can we please get back to long-forgotten ancient societies and technology that makes humanity seem small and insignificant in comparison, rather than just circle-jerking about how great spartans are? Oof. 343 really has no idea what makes Halo, Halo.
This f***ing awesome!!
This has halo Bungie trailers vibes
I almost cried when I heard the "finish the fight" tune.
Gracias 343!!!
2500s London love to see my hometown in the future
Solo te pedimos un pinche trozo de campaña ya no quiero saber nada del multijugador 😡
ODST 2
Good cutscene but where campaign gameplay at?
Finally
OMG this is amazing trailer I. I can't wait to see more of this and getting to play more
We got a release date
Infinite is like 2559 right? And Halo 3 where Earth was invaded was 2552. So this is 7 years later. She looks 17-20 in the young part, but like 30-35 in the older. I just don't understand that and that alone. Am I missing something? Like it is odd for a Teen of Earth during the Covenant invasion to be a Spartan TRAINER in Infinite.
Man soo what do you think the time period is for this. I was kinda thinking Halo 3 ODST. But that armors does not match for the Brutes and Spartans.   But to say the leas what a great trailer. I’m excited to see what happens
Hermoso siiiiii
Very cool
Delay the game until Split Screen co op is ready and  optimized for at least 30hz medium, i will not be buying the campaign until it is out.
December 8th let’s gooooooooooooooo
That was amazing
So I guess I'm the only one who shouted "Yes,ma'am" with the candidates? Although I wished to see more of the campaign, this was enough for me to get hyped for today!
So does this mean they were testing Mk 7 in 2552? Probably should have had them in Mk 5 or 6. Looks cool though.
61 brutes didn´t like this video
Anyone else think that has too much resemblance to I Love Bees?
The  location of where this is Earth as you can see big Ben at background. I don't think these are  Spartan 4 since Spartan 4 didn't exist during covenant war
Together, we are unstoppable!  Are you ready?    Spartans: Ooorah!
very beautiful!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2 days after my birthday :)
I think she look like Sadie from Halo 3: ODST Terminals  XD
Why is it so cartoony !?
Please make a trailer as with Halo ODST, those were GOLD!
SOOO FIIIIIIIIREEE!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Why call this a season one trailer when no content from season one is shown?
BRO can't wait to play this
*beautiful. The bald lady reminds me of that lady in Destiny tho*
Really humanized the new commander in a few short seconds. She's not just some hardass that will talk down to the other spartans, but someone that believes in spartans as symbols of hope. Rrally liked this short character intro.  Edit: The replies to this comment became a shitshow, so yeah, be warned.
This looks awesome. Can't wait to buy the campaign 3 months after launch.
sexy
Hey look a scene on Earth that doesn't take place in Africa!
You really are trying to fool us here 343.
So looks like Europe at the beginning.. Europe isn't really big on its black population, as for the lore, gen 3 mark 7 armor.. When? She's obviously alot younger in the part where she is being saved.. So how did she age 10 or 15 years
Well at least this was good unlike Saints Row
December 8th? Damn I was sure they would release it on the 20th anniversary of Halo CE
Sadie?
That was amazing
YO I can’t wait! I’m so excited!
That was probably the cheeziest script I've heard from Halo yet. Come on, you can write better than that.
Orbital Drop Spartan Troopers! ODSTs!
Where is the campaign :'v
This is absolute FIRE! Great work!
Amazing Trailer, though I do wish that it was announced side by side with Halo 3A
Infinite's presence at the event was pretty underwhelming. Just like every Infinite event aside from the tech preview, this is amazing but can we get some more?
DECEMBER 8TH LET’S GO
Ok?
Throughout the flashback there was no words spoken, just gestures and nods. It's so good and the visual storytelling is actually kinda neat. I really love how the Spartans are actually just silent and hyper focused on their task. Really cool.
Oh shit we got a release date now nice
well that was freaking cool!! cant wait!!
Amazing. So many easter eggs.
Damn I need a lore explanation for this trailer, like timeline and all.
HYPE
Are you ready! Yes ma’am! Is the game ready! Ye...
I'd love to see this vibe in campaign!
Literal chills running through my body
Absolutely stunning
I’m loving Infinites music so much!
Halo is back. Absolute chills.
I was like, "Good, they got the scaling right!" The spartans are huge compared to here. But then she's a spartan training cadets and she's bigger than them? I don't think augmentation works that way.
😍
Thank you for the release date lol
Launch yessss 8 diciember
What???? We missed the golden 20 year mark! Still hyped for this December
where's the campaign gameplay 343....we'd like to know....
See you guys December 8th.
By the rings
OMG IT'S HAPPENING! EVERYBODY STAY CALM! 🏃‍♂️💨
THE MUSIC, THE TRAILER OMG TAKES ME BACK !!  SO DAMN GOOD 343!
:00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000'00000000000000000000
I hear that Halo 2 theme in there!
Big fan of the trailer!! Let’s gooooo
DECEMBER 8...🥳🥳
The ODST ambient give me Goosebumps ;)
That head nod is so hype 1:20
Great trailer. On behalf of the community I can't express how excited we are. Thank you 343. I can't wait to play with you all December 8th! 🙂 LETS GO SPARTANS
I love how they make Spartans look here.         Then I remember Reach. Lol.
Hell yeah!!!
10/10 cinematic
This is so hype it feels like I'm taking adrenaline
Simplemente orgásmico este tráiler
gEN 3 mK vii in 2552 though???
Very disappointed that to celebrate 20 years they release a console version of infinite which ain't anything new they have done it before,  I kinda expected an anniversary for 3 or ce maybe but sadly no and no gameplay either which is also more disappointing tbh
At least hoodies are still fashionable in 500 years
Missed opportunity releasing it when ce was released
At least she doesn’t have that stupid haircut with side shaved that looks ugly as hell
Compared to the Halo 3: Starry Night trailer this is pathetic
More charcter development then Osiris
Them spartans look sexy! Also The H2 music 🤤
Wow that was beautiful! This got me extremely excited for Halo infinite! And i can't wait to play it!
Omg I'm not a fkn man if i didn't say I teared up a bit after seeing this. 343 you're making all of us wet 💦😂
"Could we possibly make any more noise??"
Mark VII is great for marketing infinite, absolutely amazing design
OH MY GOD WE GOT A DATE
This trailer really makes me wish we could have a game on earth again like the environments looked soooooo cool in this trailer, I hope we get at least some maps on Earth
Cant wait to stream Multiplayer and Campaign!!
Who’s here in 2024?
Weeee
Cool cinematic, but how about we allocate these resources to making the game complete at launch aye?   Also: the ending when she is motivating the cadets saying "I can't hear you" was weak af. I feel like she was giving that speech in a library.
IM SO EXITED TO PLAY THIS GAME I am a little sad it was not November 15 but its fine
Laurette has the serial number 327 on her power pack and the 3rd generation of Spartans are the only known Spartans to have serial numbers above 300 so she could be from either Alpha or Beta company
Not a huge fan of the H5 phantoms but this looks super dope. When did the covies invade Britain? New lore?
when did this invasion happen? can't of been the battle of earth cos there were very few other spartans around, espcially not the new gen. can't be banished cos of covie equipment. when else did covies invade earth?
This trailer is so sick 🤘 can’t wait for more campaign
This doesn’t make any sense, when would there of been brutes in London and also Spartans to fight them?
When can we pre oder the game ?
*inhales copium*
Wow, graphics are so so so good!
1:52 I love how they reinforce how big spartans really are
I love Halo but I thought the MJOLNIR Spartan program used kids and trained and altered said kids physically.. this trailer is kinda stupid. Reminds me of the mortal Kombat movie that just came out.. all of a sudden Sonya had her powers.. now this chick has what it takes to be a Spartan.. seems woke. I'll return it for an immediate refund if there's anything woke in the campaign.
Discover Cope
Hope <3
Holy shit.  This is beautiful.
One doesn’t experience self-transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates.🎈
together we are untouchable ... are you ready?
I like how they gave a bit of a backstory to the training instructor person,
This looks SO awesome! I cant wait!
Holy SHIT I'm so excited! DECEMBER 8TH BABY!!
LETS GO BOIIIIS!!!
is this the girl from the ODST campaign?
Despite all the controversy that there has been with Infinite in recent days, this trailer, its release date, the elite controller and the special console edition ... made me forgive everything. EVERYTHING!
SADIE FROM ODST !!!!😭😭
Why do i have a tear in my eye?
wait delayed AGAIN
Brutaaaaal me encanta que le den lore a los personajes
So are those supposed to be be the other spartans-IIs left on earth during the covenants invasion while chief followed truth?  Or is this a non-canon scene?
1:54 I sometimes forget how big Spartans are,then I see scenes like this and think GODDAMN!!!
0:56 Is THAT CRAIG????? If it is, si looking beautiful 😍😍😍
Happy Halo got its identity back
Chills down my spine
me, I'll go first.
Me moje banda me moje
This was a fantastic trailer! I'm excited if each season is getting something like this!
is that London in the halo universe?😱😱😱 Amazingg
HALO INFINITE ❤
help, I'm excited
Ohhh my god December 8 I can't believe that day when I get my hands on halo😇👏 last time I missed all Halo three 😡 but this  time I'm gonna be playing Halo infinite like it's the only thing which is worth for me 🤗
Made me feel better after that awful Saints Row trailer
Love seeing the old drop pods back!
I can't wait to be able to play this piece of art
My, those Spartans look *glorious.*
Amazing trailer.
This is awesome but we're all still worried about forge and co-op
So...we went from Master Chief to Massa Chief?
This makes me feel like a kid.
What is the age of the girl? , That was spartans IV , not Spartans ll or lll , the season its called heroes from reach , so why are they spartans IV?
YES YES YES YESZZZZIR WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!,! !
POOOORRRRAAAAA BOM DEMAIS
Well hot diggity damn Halo no need to be that aggressive
Did you almost cry?….
cringiest trailer I have ever seen, beautiful cg ruined by today's trashy diversity industry.
This is set during covenant invasion
When we needed them the most they returned!!!   🙌🙌🙌🙌 This is probably gonna be the best Halo we've had since 3. And by the looks of it might just surpass 3 once forge and co-op mode will arrive.
This is amazing! I haven’t been so hyped for halo since the announcement trailer back in 2018.
THIS IS MAGICAL  I HAVE CHILLS
This is awesome
Now, who's first?
Bruh a bit of halo 3 here 1:49
This is giving me mad Halo ODST/Wars vibes
I don't know why those brutes stopped charging at the Spartan or why those Spartans decided hand-to-hand combat was better than just headshotting the brutes with their ARs. Gorgeous trailer, the combat is just a bit nonsensical.
I mean, that's cool and all, but that trailer totally belies the utter brutality of the Spartan program, especially in the early days, and what that meant for new recruits (kids).
There better be some sort of spartan ops from the look of this trailer    Other wise this lore is as relevant as leauge of legends cinematics
This looks absolutely amazing
Yes, we finally got a date
This makes Spartan-IV's seem a lot more cooler
December 8th hell yeah My wife’s birthday too Happy early birthday 🥳
See you on the battlefield, Spartans! Hoorah
Tears tears in my eyes
So this spartan 4 was a teenager/young adult on earth that got saved by spartans in gen 3 but she looks way older in the "present" clips so what exactly is this time line? And did the banished invade earth?
What a bad overwatch clone 🤮🤮🤮
Omg this is amazing I can't wait
Call of Duty video and now Halo 👀 Battlefield next?
Hey, this is pretty cool
Can't wait for @Just some guy without a mustache to comment here.
BOOO rated T
Damn the halo 3 vibes in the music
You don't see Spartans smile much when there helmets are off so it's pretty heart warming too see.
That Spartan is HUGE!
Already she’s better than Palmer by simply putting respect and discipline to the Spartan name.
We went from the ODST trailer to this.  Why does the Spartan program sound like the girl scouts now.
And thus, 343 won
December 8th 🤯
The Big Ben? So this scene takes place in London during the Covenant Invasion of earth?
Can you guys please market your damn game I know the MP is free but still
I’m confused about the lore behind this. It appears to take place on Earth given Big Ben in the background during the beginning which would mean it takes place during the invasion of Earth from Halo 2 & 3. But we can see (presumably) Spartan IVs in GEN 3 Mark 7 armor which would put this several years after the battle for Earth. So, either that’s not Big Ben, or those are Spartan 3s testing prototype Mjolnir Generation 3 tech all the way back in 2552 prior to GEN 2 even being finished.
So hyped
Wonder what time period the flash back takes place. Halo 3? Was that the cov? Or the banished? Was weird to see s4’s. I’m not a huge lore guy but it was hard to tell, seemed like a mix of all the games settings
Cringe
It’s awesome but campaign?
Classic covenant theme omg i feel like kid again
I wish the actual game looked as good as this trailer.
Loke changed sex to be politicaly correct, and the trailer is pretty badass
LETSSSSSS GOOOOO
Is this related to the I love Bees marketing campaign?   Cuz I saw a bee.
A suprise to be sure, but a welcome one.
Alright, that's December 8 taken off of the work calendar
It's good to see spartans being heroes again. We felt that in Halo 2 and 3
LOVE IT! SAME FEELING AS THE HALO 3 ADS!
Looks like The Banished have destroyed at least one of Cortana's "giant dumb space owls"... no idea why they were so worried about them turning up in Shadows of Reach.   Either that or it's a flashback to the Battle of Earth between Halo 2 and 3.
Wow
0:04 Kinda neat seeing Big Ben in a Halo trailer. In fact, I don’t think we’ve ever seen any real-life landmarks in Halo before.
Another cinematic trailer i didnt need....
Go woke or go broke.
Hell yea
Aaaahhh hearing Halo 3 theme when the Spartan held he’s hand out made me had chills I’m soooo ready for halo again 😀
London!!! <3
What can I say. I love Bees
Sick how they’re making a backstory for new characters, hopefully better than Halo 5, where Osiris was hated because we literally knew nothing about them and why the became Spartans (except for Buck)
yoooooo
PREPARE TO DROP!
Gosh 3 mpre months
oh damn that was so good
LFG
They say Together we will finish the fight so go on Spartans for you know what the ladies like
WHERE'S THE GAMEPLAY CHAMPS!?
I’m in love!  I actually almost cried watching this.  I was disappointed in the presentations end where they showed off hardware. I really wanted them to announce Halo 3 anniversary.
Really wish halo would’ve go back to being M rated it made it stand out from other Sci Fi shooters with the amount of blood also I’m gonna assume the rating Is for the whole game so we probably won’t be seeing the flood I hope I’m wrong and the t rating is just for the free multiplayer
YEEEEES, MULTIPLAYER LORE WITH CINEMATICS EACH SEASON!!!!!
Sadly not November 15th, but y’know. There will be another Halo after ten years… right?
As a bri'ish man I highly approve.
🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
efectivamente 343 es GOD
Holy shit, if you didn't know how big Spartans were already, you do now!
Bro
🔵🔵
December 8th friends and family of the halo community
So, I suppose those are Spartan 4s? Cause that one limping Spartan cant be a 2 or 3
Not gonna lie I was expecting some campaign trailer and gameplay but that was sick.
It's rated T?! God dammit.
Godamn that gave off halo 3 vibes
Epic🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
this is just beautiful, simply amazing
0:05 Big Ben never got an upgrade lol
Honestly, without split-screen campaign I couldn't give less of a sh*t about this game. You've killed my excitement 343, and you're not getting my money. So thanks a lot 👎
DECEMBER 8😭😭😭😈
Wait, Halo infinite will be rated T ?
Dude ok that was insane. But is there not going to be a Collectors Edition.
Spartans never die 💚
I'm so hyped for this!!!! I got a chance to play it and I love how it plays it's going to be so awesome!!!!! It's reminds me of Halo 3 which was the best Halo!!!! I couldn't stand H5
Are these banished forces or covenant???
And we wait
Imagine having a full movie tho
Bro I really gotta wait all the way till dec 8, please come sooner
That was it.
Bri'sh Spartan
Interest rising...
Meh delay now
Video is amazing
Craig looking fire rn
:))))
Spartan gets dropped into battle from drop pod. First things first, let’s give a nod to a random person instead of coming out shooting like my brethren.
Well that was sick
Is she a Spartan 3?
I'm a bit disappointed that the Phantom design is the same as Halo 4 & 5, but it really is just a small detail. This looks great! Can't wait to get my hands on Infinite.
Surprised they are releasing after Black Friday but I am super pumped. Can't wait!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Lets go 🎉
Can’t wait, and I’m ready for this
This is beautiful 🤩 🥺😱
Dec 8th
The trailer was damn good, reminds me of old school classic Halo cinematics from Reach and 3!
This looks incredible
I don’t think the ODST would appreciate Spartans using their drop pods very much 🤣. Jokes aside cool trailer
POG
HYPE
Do you see how big the spartans hand is? 1:53
Campain Gameplay please 🙏🙏🙏
Halo 3 odst vibes, love it
Beautiful! Just, beautiful...
YOOOO CANT WAIT TO DOMINATE THE MAPS!!! Cant wait to upload the campaign!!!
His hand is BIG
This shit launches on my b day fck yeah
Genial loco
Wait…the Covenant invaded Earth again!? I saw the Big Ben and those were Spartan IV’s!
Let’s goooo keep pushing 343 you got this!
Now that's how you do mother fuggin world building.
Omg!!!
I have never said this before about a Halo game but I actually miss playing Halo: Infinite.
All together now!   "I LOVE YOU HAAAALO, AND IF ITS QUITE ALRIGHT, I NEED YOU HAAAALO!" 😍😍😍
Holy shit I can’t wait
1:50 That Epic Halo 3 tune from Marty near the end, just chills...
“What is it?”  “That music — I’ve heard it before.”
I AM SO HAPPY THEY ARE DOING THE SEASON CINEMATIC KINDA THING, THIS IS AWESOME
Look how fucken giant them Spartans are
Looks fantastic! December 8th cant come soon enough!! :-D
It is so beautiful it is this halo veteran cry with joy
So is that the official release date
That felt so much like halo
December 8th baby
I might be the only one but I still like the old shields more. The new ones look weird to me
Cool
December 8, 2021 mark your calendars 😈😈😈
THE RELEASE DATE OH MY GOD LETS FKIN GOOOO
Well it’s about dang time, outstanding work.
Wow you really put that at the end huh
I can’t wait for this!!! So excited!!
The game needs delay after what happened to cyberpunk. Live service games are unacceptable also with main features missing from it.
Oh yeah it's all coming together
Perfecto
This is gonna be amazing

She kinda reminds me of the character you find audio logs of halo 3 odst I think she was called sadie?
Hypeeeeeeee lookin good
Shiiiiieeet

Im cry
This is some relief after hearing the bad news before
Niiiiooocceee
Pure Halo.
HYPE : ON
She loves bees🐝
halo netflix series when?
How did she grow?
I'm so confused is that banished or is that covenant brutes from Halo 3? Cause then you got new generation spartans with the Keystone helmet.
This, THIS IS HALO!
I need it
That gave me chills! I'm so ready for this!
At first I thought it was from the campaign 😭  So this is why she wanted to be a spartan
Está tan cerca que ya casi puedo saborearlo...
This feels like I’m watching a trailer for a movie. This is so good!
Nice, but if you had this trailer why wasn't it shown yesterday in Gamescom, I literally just watch it because of Halo, and Halo not being in there left me with a bad perception of Gamescom
Hermoso. Sublime. We are hope!!!
1:23 terminator 2 reference?
love the remix of the soundtrack from halo 2, heavy nostalgic vibes
Goosebumps
Amo el bendito soundtrack ! 💜
0:56, the brutes armor looks so good
