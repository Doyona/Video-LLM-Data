Your not welcome anymore gotti you take down a tru Memphis king
.... Slick dissing at this point is just begging for the  easy way out of this wreck that you used to call a life, you laid a hand on one of the anointed...  I think you're cowardly.
Look, I wasn't never a hater on Gotti , just a real life Dolph fan. The niggas words just resonated and music was inspirational. Motivational. Instructional.. And beats was banging, King of ad libs,... Tonight I listened to 2 Gotti songs and I understand now what its like to be a hater. The best way I can say is that I just don't buy the energy. I just don't believe your energy. It doesn't match your words. And what are you even trying to accomplish except self snitching?   I think the songs were fine. Designed to be hits. It wouldn't matter who rapped what on them..  Me personally, I love music that s real. That's why I will always listen to young Dolph,, Forever Young Dolph,,. Immortal.. Can't say you aren't immortalized now also.. the cancer of Memphis. The shiniest. The slimiest. Judas. Brutus.  LLD &PRE 5L👼🏿🐬👼🏿🐬👼🏿🐬

Dolph’s music sounded good, better though. Ghotti is arm strong and hard flex. That’s the difference. Different ppl. There never could of been a comparison. Both streets but Dolph cared more for ppl. Ghotti for the gang. But all in all, Ghotti appeals to hard gangsters, Dolph to ppl that liked good sound more then flex, Dolph had money too and was building. Unnecessary beef, they probably never would of got allong, Dolph pushed too hard against Ghotti (to be fair) in his songs but he also got killed. It’s better to have ppl to compete for crown, not saying one deserves it or who owns it, but if one is saying I got the crown and am better. Prove it in the music, not bullets. It’s gang ik but bullets don’t say I won at music, says you won at gang. You already got that crown though. And many listeners are ppl trying to make it up in areas not there but also many out there want good music, they aren’t in or near Memphis. Dolph should not of dissed Ghotti so much in song but the beef should be lyrics only. Is it gang or music, when you mix them too much it hurts more then helps. It adds flavor to have and understood formal beef. Outdo him. Look at Eminem, he ain’t no regular rap rapper but he excells. White but but made a name in wrap. Many listeners enjoy that but do anything about the mob as Dolph mentioned it. Their lifestyle in gang may not be okay and might produce money just like music could but at the very least separate the two. I mean I’ve seen other rappers dis other rappers but never once do they get lynch men to get them killed, only in rap. He knows he had ppl hit Dolph. Dissing his songs but even his legacy songs sound better. And many artist get busted for murder by lyrics in their songs. Cops and some average ppl know how to read every lyric in wordplay and what it means. At least 5 in this obvious. From the grace his songs still hit better. My point is healthy criticism and who All you appeal to. And yeah Dolph was way too hard on you in lyrics. He disrespected you clearly in many verses, I never agreed with that or thought it was good. Was too much. But he was a good singer, idk about other but he sang good, idk beyond that the dealings that led to beef. But he told the world his beef yeah but to be fair his beats hit way harder. He was a way better artist. When it came to king of Songs. Dolph was king and is. You have hard rap, he had good sounding rap. Your voice got more of a crunch that sadly don’t roll as well as smooth on the ears as Dolph, plus he had fire beats, yours once again are more hard rollers for harder gangsters. But the healthy criticism, dividing between music industry and gang and not overly blending them unless your main appeal is to hard gangsters to gain more support for a bigger hustle in gang rather then music. Y’all were opposites to a degree but not like you say it does not seem. But more criticism, now the opposite, Yo Ghotti could be the king in music and be all the same just said about Dolph on music appeal. Because the factor is this. Different ppl like different sounds. Corse hard sounds better then soft and smoothe like Dolph had. Appeals to about the same about the same amount of ppl, so who was the king of music in Memphis? Hard to say, because they are opposites. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, they are both different so it’s not possible to compare. The beef of who is a better rapper is about like saying which of two pretty ladies are more beautiful, unlike counting dollars, that’s not something that can be calculated. Vain persuit. I can’t agree offing Dolph was good as ik they don’t care about that, it was not beneficial but as much as I hate that. I’m true to facts. Yo Ghotti songs sound good too, fire. That’s a fair opinion.
Classic Album 🔥🔥

YG short for YO GOTTI
Great tribulation is coming.  The only way through is Jesus Christ.  You must be born again and believe in Him.  He came from heaven as God, born of a virgin and lived a sinless life as man in the flesh and paid the price for our sins.  Falsely accused and unjustly imprisoned, tortured and hung from the cross, His death and resurrection and the shedding of His blood for the redemption of our sins makes us free.  He paid the price and did it all.    Romans 10:9-10:  All who call on the name of the Lord will be saved.  You see what's in the skies, Jesus is the way, the truth, and the life.  Come to everlasting life!..
I'm a gotti fan but this song is garbage too many cars and jewelry so what. Real

Yo Gott is sitting comfortable on top of the the rap game. 🔥🔥🔥
What a total wreck for the rap crowd this dude is a joke well your gonna finna hit the block as you spend your money on his flop instead of getin you a Glock
https://youtu.be/J-PyMOJmnp8
The media shows you that if you don't have wealth, jewels or hordes of woman, you haven't achieved success, success in achieving these things is actually worthless in God's eyes, because you can use your free will to get all these things easily, but after you die, you'll stand before God, and your gonna have to give an account for your life. Now the Bible says we have all sinned against God, no one is good not one, so if you think your going to heaven all by your lonesome you are hellbound, so you must put your trust in Jesus Christ, as the perfect holy and blameless one who took your sins on that cross, and died for you, because He loves you, but if you don't accept Him and follow Him, the alternative is Hell
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💯💯💯💯💯💯

Dolph is the king of Memphis 🐬
Can't hate on this man, coming with this level of quality.
Would you like to hear some good news? This is the best news you’ll ever hear. All of us, without exception, have sinned and fall short of the glory of God (Romans 3:23). And because God is just and will not let sin go unpunished, the wages of sin is death (Romans 6:23). As a result, that means that as sinners, we will all get what we rightly deserve: eternal punishment, which is called the second death. But the good news is that God is loving and does not wish that any should perish but that all would come to repentance (2 Peter 3:9). So He made a way for us to be saved and now graciously offers you the free gift of eternal life through Jesus Christ (Romans 6:23), all while justice is done. He sent His Son, Jesus Christ, to die on behalf of us and pay for our sins on a cross, and He was then buried and rose again on the third day (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Regardless of who you are or what you may have done, if you believe with your heart the gospel ( ^^ which I just mentioned above) and confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord, you shall be saved (Romans 10:9,10). Salvation is simple and free. It’s not a 12 step program, and don’t think, as many do, that you just have to be a “good person” or do good works to go to heaven. Salvation is based on what Jesus did, not what you do (Ephesians 2:8,9). Believe in Christ, and you will be saved. “For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son that whosoever should believe in Him shall not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world but to save the world through Him.” John 3:16,17

Yo gotti is the jayz of the south
You all love when nuccas ain't talking bout shit🤦🏿.
Jesus is coming back soon! The Bible foretold all of the things that are happening in the world right now over 2,000 years ago. The New World Order is about to come into power and the world is about to go into the 7 year tribulation, which is going to be literal hell on earth. Everything is coming together exactly like God said it would! Yes, for the world it is a hopeless situation, but the good news is that God has provided an escape through faith in Jesus Christ alone!       John 3:16: “For God so loved the world that he gave His one and only Son, that whoever believes in Him will not perish, but have everlasting life.”       We are all born sinners and doomed to spend eternity in hell. Romans 3:10 states that “There is no one righteous, not even one”.       Romans 3:23 explains: “For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.” We all have a sin debt that we owe God and it is so great that we can never possibly repay it. However, the good news is that Jesus paid that debt by dying and suffering the wrath of God in our place on the cross, and three days later He rose from the dead in ultimate victory over sin and death.       Romans 6:23 says: “The wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.” God loves us more than we can even imagine and is offering every single person forgiveness and salvation, regardless of what anyone has done, if only they repent and put their faith in Jesus Christ alone. We can never do anything to earn salvation no matter how good of a person that we think we are. Isaiah 64:6 states: “all our righteous acts are like filthy rags”. But praise God that when we accept Christ as our savior, Jesus gives us His righteousness! It’s a GIFT!       Romans 10:9-10 explains: “That if you confess with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you confess and are saved.”       Romans 10:13 “Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved”.        Jesus IS Lord and the Bible says one day all will confess that and bow their knee before Him. Unfortunately, there will be many that do that right before they go into eternal torment in the lake of fire. Do it now before it is too late! Jesus is real, He is the Son of God, He gave His life for us, and three days later He rose from the dead. To this day there is an empty tomb in Jerusalem! He is coming back soon to rapture every true believer. Don’t be left behind to experience the wrath of God that’s about to fall on this world. Repent of your sins and get saved now before it’s too late. John 14:6: (Jesus speaking) “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.”  Here are a couple links for further information.

Hey guys getting raped literally biologically takes away your ability to complain. Please relay this information to everyone on earth I think we can stop AIDS and go to Avatar/bonobo mode or something. Also I think when you die you just get absorbed by the fungus network under the earth [[ Mushroom Kingdom :) ]] and get reborn as another baby somewhere or whatever.
