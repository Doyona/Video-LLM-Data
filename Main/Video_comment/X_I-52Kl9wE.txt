Arsenal are struggling with games? They are out of 2 cups already though and had no Europa league for ages now. How an earth are they struggling?! 😂😂 my team are in all 4 cups and have even less of a squad. Arteta needs to learn from Ten Hag about squad rotation.
Tierney start LB Zinny midfield  Martinelli 9 Trossard LW Nketiah sun in
Nice to see everyone coming bk here to top of the league tv
COYG LET'S GO
Arsenal will finish 4th
Great to see the proper AFTV back again. I didn't recognise the imposter in it's place this season.
yous let a eight point lead slip in two games and think you'll still win it lool arsenal finish 4th
It’s the hope that kills you innit lads
I've been a GOONER 50 years and it's been good to see our season end in February...........it's usually October!!! Helps to have gallows humour being an arsenal fan!! Lol😜
But how does anyone beat a team that has cheated for 5 seasons?
As I’ve always said-City by ten!
Who's this oddball Goblin ?? lol.....Always 1 with the "I said it'll happen, I told ya this and that"....prat
Better players win games.
Lee is amongst the last of his kind. These football fans are disappearing, replaced by....
Walkers put Mbappe in his pocket twice
Worried he might poke the mrs eye out with that nose 😂😂
Surprised they arent calling for Artetas head! You arsenal scum are so flipant and fickle. The difference between champs and chumps
Eddie Missed That header city scored 2 mins after 😃😃
Gabriel was nervous The players played nervous cant belive that its embrrassing
arsenal no matter what have had a good season but be honest they are not better than man city  do think this was arsenal best chance of winning the premiership next season Newcastle will spend big and be better and again man city will improve and if man united take over happens they will improve and of course chelsea
should arteta make any changes to the XI ahead of villa tomorrow lunchtime? 🔴
Reis Nelson is the answer.!!!
Why is no one talking about penalty awarded to Arsenal? Never seen these given in PL, unless the keeper puts stud above knee. Even Arsenal players didnt realize a penalty was given.
We have achieved the target! Top four!
Resting players for the FA Cup halted Arsenals winning momentum. Arsenal have lost 2 and drawn at home since. Emery has Villa purring nicely at the moment, so Arsenal will not win this one. Throw the FA Cup in the bin as usual if you have to, but not at the expense of a winning momentum. Arsenal will NOT win the title this season. Its the wrong time of season to be looking up at Man City.
Very good bottle job by Arsenal 😊
We will never win the league tittle maybe we could be in the champions league
HaHa told you guys Arsenal always mess up second half of the season typical of Arsenal not-thing new there 😂😂 manutd fan🎉
AFTV is back
WE SHOULD HAVE PAID FOR MUDRYK.. that guy.. he’s perfect for us, our system. Chelsea’s not playing his strengths they have too many new players
One shot on target penalty come mon city
We won the league after 18 games f.c
Brighton Loading...score will be 1-0 to Brighton 😏😏
AFTV coming back after years of mid 😭
Like clock work the collapse is coming
Same old mistakes of not investing in squad depth!!!When will Edu learn???????????
Arsenal does great in the beginning of the season and just runs out of steam nearing the end. They are such an amazing team best of luck in the coming games to stay on top of the league.
Man said ‘Pep Gwollyolla’
Typical. It's all gone Chicken Licken at the first sign of trouble. Gooners must have exited the stadium at double speed like headless chickens. The only thing missing from this interview was the thrown in towel flying across the screen, and the white flag hoisted in the background. Another loss before March and it'll be, "Ar'e'a aah'!" ("Arteta out!")
Great game and atmosphere but Arsenal fans throwing stuff at professional footballers is totally fkn out of order.
🤣🤣🤣🤡🤡🤡
The  writing is  on  the  wall  asual.  Plain  to. See.   Another  year  of broken  dreams   one  hit  wonders
Another spin on that bottle cap
there are no positives when you are crushed by the team that would have been 6 points with a game in hand behind you ,i would concentrate on the top 4 now if i were u
Lee is right, we should appreciate/enjoy the joy this run brought us even if it has come to an end. COYG!!! Lets go.
DON Robbie... It's been a few months my friend but it's good to be back. See you next week pal
This bloke on Saturday after brentford game 'we will beat city'
Surely Arsenal will not bottle the league they boasted they would win!! Surely not!!
We had chance too strengthen we didnt!end of we needed a 6 and a 9 we failed
Arteta cold had to experiment new taktick folse no 9 with trossard
Poor run of 4 games 1 draw, 3 losses only 2 goals scored. Arteta needs to address that. Hopefully this is our poor run done.  16 games left, we’re still in this!
Needed a big striker
Great start to the season but that’s it Liverpool FC are coming boys
City fan here I said to my son Arsenal won’t be able to keep the first half effort up , second half they looked tired. Also the last thing Arsenal need is a 12:30 lunchtime kick off away going to be a real test now.
Mesute yaptiklerizin ceasing goruyorsunuz
Well said Lee,lfc  fan here,we're man city on fire?No and still scored 3 how do you complete with a team with unlimited resources,you need 100 points to beat these cheaters
Said it months ago, Arsenal blew their load way too early. Their reaction to winning games in October was like it was April on the run in, they’re done.
Think man City end up 1st, man utd end 2nd and Arsenal will end 3rd. By the end of the season they will drop a lot more and I feel city will get better!
Arteta is planning To fail,  Cheaper Player=Cheaper Motivation period
😂😂😂😂😂
i feeeeeeeeeel gooooooooooood 😅
1-3 is what happens when  you buy cheap
I’m worried too - apart from this vid, Turkish and Robbie - this channel barely getting views
Where is Jacub Kiwior?
These are good times for Robbie ! $$$
Lack of attacking reinforcements. Eddie just not quite there yet. We knew bout Jesus so not sure why a striker was not bought. Some a little bit clinical.
Top
"Eddie are you OK, are you OK , are you OK Eddie.
We hesitated. We came on to the game with nerves.
It's the history of the arsenal
Seen the same story under Wenger for years. Top at Christmas, 4th end of season. We're not winning the league.
Lee you lot are such bottle jobs you lot might finish 8th again😂😂😂😂😂
2:18 says it all, he can't even say 'why we can win the title'. Small club mentality
Giroud ,would of scored with the headers
Support no matter win or lose. COYG❤
Arteta goodbye and keep jumping on the touch lines
To be honest City was better bro.
The manner of the defeat gives me confidence arsenal can remain in the title chase! On another night arsenal are 2 nil up at half time. It's all about how the players react going forward that will determine where arsenal finish the season. I have faith they still can get the top spot.
HAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHA ASSNA IS BACK LOL I LOVE THIS
💪🏻🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Lee knows how big of a loss that was psychologically. Advantage City.
Bottle jobs London will always be blue!
Martinelli is getting no service from neither xhaka, odegaard or zinchenko. Zinchenko has been chocking for me all season. Just cause he inverts fans are droolin over him. The problem is if xhaka has a bad game the inverted zinchenko is a bigger passanger than Ozil was. Tierney needs to start next game and overlap and Martinelli will score twice
Arsenal finally humbled
1st time this season I have been able to look at AFTV,  may the usual meltdowns begin, happy days, the end is neigh.....
Top Quality comments as always.
Aftv secretly happy, billionaire boys club lol
DRESSED LIKE A TWAT
Thought you had nothing to worry about Robbie ha ha ha ha.... End up 3rd probably
poor Robbie all his all his daily videos about players linked with us for weeks what a waste of time we needed a goal scoreing centre foward we sold our best two goal keepers loaned out a goal scoreing centre foward gave 35 millon for midfield player that is no good i could go on and on we will be luckey to get top 4
funniest thing ever is they acts believed theyd win the league LOL
AFTV IS BACK…NOW AM ABLE TO WATCH😂😂😂😂
Absolutely disgusting treatment of Kevin De Bruyne by the Arsenal fans, because he was the best player on the pitch and ran through Arsenal, when he is subbed to keep him fresh, the Arsenal fans threw objects at him as he walked back to the dugout. It is an outrage, he was extremely lucky he didn't sustain any serious injuries, but that's what Arsenal fans do only attack in numbers against someone who can't fight back without serious repercussions. I hope Arsenal has the balls to scan the CCTV and find all those throwing objects and ban them all for life, the cowards.
I told you lot 2 weeks ago andnive said all season you will bottle  it like always
Let the fall begin 😂
Fuck I wish Claude was still around
Totally concured with you
Trossard has to play upfront while Jesus is injured! Otherwise Martinelli becomes 1 dimensional without a team mate to work with..  Nkhetia needs to go on loan, he does t get it, yet.. I don’t care about prior tap on goals Hes scored,, I care about the ability of today and tomorrow.. Until we give a chance to trossard up front, to run riot in the box and play along side Martinelli,. we will be lucky to finish 3rd
Where are all those fan's that says we have bigger fish fry?
YOU NEED A SONG THAT IS YOURS< Aleez Aleez Aleez is claimed by Liverpool, in England, sing it but its not yours Where's Saka's song ?  where,s, Odeegards song At highbury they got sang home Your trying to beat rich scum ,  Encourage ,encourage Get those songs ready for next year 1-0 nil to the Arsenal,. you can sing it , without actually scoring you know, its just encouragement
losing to everton was a big mistake, they are the games you dont lose if youre going to be champs end of.....ok....draw against brentford.....but 3 points against everton was a definite win situation and nothing else.....a draw against city and we would hve been doing ok....loss to everton was just typical arsenal.....and we were boys against men last night.....city will win the title....united will probably be second and we should finish third.....oh good...better than fourth....fck sake....
Mudryk and Felix would have helped us...
we are done.....no title thats for sure.....city have overcome big points deficits before and they have done it again.....and united are coming as well....seems we are fighting for third rather than fourth......65% possession and lost....awful....pep spanked arteta big and good......theyve now beaten us twice in a week or so.....its easy to see why we wont win.....if saka and mrtinelli are worn we dont perform.....we bought jesus as a goalscorer and he wont ever score loads....and of course hes not even playng....keeping nketiah, mistake....still....we sold olivier giroud and what did he win after he left us....oh yeah...fa cup, champs league, world cup, euro nations, italian championship......whilst still scoring goals.....and we buy.....jorghino.......youre f*cking kidding me right.....still not getting top players.....
Where's Mr NHS?
Arsenal have had a easy start to the season, playing most hard teams at home If Arsenal keep it together the title will be decided at Anfield
ARSENAL was 8 points i front few weeks ago , now the PL is lost , wake up ARSENAL Fans its over ...
Whoever thought Arsenal would win the league was deluded
Still gonna win the league at the Ethiad.
Lee thanks for not pressing the panic button, like most Arsenal fans do.
No one talking about the Japanese Arsenal player placing the ball at KDB feet? Psychology difficult to get past that when you’re playing a team like City.
Did Ederson make a save?
Those defenders can't understand what Arsenal is want because they play like midfielders  passing ball back passes
I'm a city fan but to all you lot saying banter fc is back, shame on you. they have the same points as us with a game in hand so they are more or less still 1st. unless you're a city fan, arsenal are above you in the table right now so worry about your own club 😂😂
Get nketiah out!!!
Start the new Defender instead of Magalhes.
Well said Lee… Good luck for the season mate
Poor everyfink! 🍿🍿
BANTER FC is back 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Eddie has been ok but chance goals have gone,we need actual know how.Trossard should EVERY GAME and play Gaby uptop
its high time Arteta played Zinny in xhakas role n put Tierney where he belongs.HOLDING for Saliba coz all teams are gonna target him with long balls,he is poor on the aerial
You've gone....... City will finish 10 clear ahead of 2nd placed United
Few mistakes that was made, was putting in Tomiyasu for White and they should have e dropped martinelli in the middle, subbed Nketiah and Troussard on the left.
Arsenal's new documentary is called "All for nothing" I love it.
🔋 ran out we won't get bk the number 1 spot
Don't defend Martenelli just because he had done good things in the past, he had 5 stinker games so far and every time Trossard comes in he does a way better job than Martinelli. Same position same service.
You have to score when you're on top. First half when we were at our best, we didn't score a goal in open play. Second half when City were at their best, they plugged away two.
How can you lose 11 times in a row to a club?
Lee is THE only Arsenal fan that’s NOT delusional. The rest in the whole world are. How are you gonna win the league with 20+ games left and the manager is Arteta 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Lee thrown in the towel already, pathetic
Trust the Process
How long before Arteta Out ???
This channel will reach the next level once Arsenal officially bottle this title challenge.
Within the next couple of games we'll see the gritted teeth and rendition of 'Eez fackin dun it again!'.
It's still in Arsenal's hands, game in hand yet it's City who remain calm, fans and team alike...and Arsenal are imploding with over reactive sentimental bollocks .....get a grip gooners
Arsenal since signing Jorginho:  ❌ Lost to Everton ❌ Drew with Brentford ❌ Lost to Manchester City  You can take Jorginho out of Chelsea but you can't take the Chelsea out of Jorginho
There is nothing to be worried about the title is gone period. I’m not even confident of Top 4 at this point.
Arsenal will end up fighting with Tottenham for 4th place. Loool
Bottled it 🤣
Funny how Ty never does an interview when Arsenal are beaten by the better team. VAR in favour of Arsenal twice so he can't complain about the officials 😂
You can blame the defence but arsenal are not getting the results becoz they dont have rashford or halaand players who score minimum of one goal week in out..when the team scores the defence also work with high level of confidence..
Two words - Good Ebening !!
Sounds like uve already given up pal😂😂😂
Bro..no need to worries bro
Okey cokey is only a week or two away
Corrupt refs. Corrupt City. Complicit league. Arsenal are top of the table in reality not the fantasy all the fans will live in. F the EPL.
Arsenal just got hit with reality.
nothing to worry about. still win the league.
coach special boy  martineli will start all game even if he lose his legs
Lee judges is the only real gooner on this channel
Yep Lee did say that about shoring up our defence, he never shys away from straight talking.
Where are all these cocky Arsenal fans now 😆  saying they won the league back in Christmas!! When a few bad results happen they all go into meltdown. Absolutely hilarious!!!
Worried about what? Finishing in the top 4? I know he can't be talking about being Worried about the title race because that is well and truly over! Blown 8 points in the last 3 games so please do not even mention a title race. It lasted for about 18 games. It was fun while it lasted but face the truth it is over.
No plan B, virtually  non / low level reinforcement in January, the squad is short in capability, experience & numbers -  the  momentum has shifted.....1 Man City,  2 Man Utd,  3 Arsenal this will be at  risk........remember Emery 20+ games run and we ended up 5th....
Check the views on these compared to when they’ve won 😂😂😂
It's over gents
I'm a Man Utd fan but that was a great match to watch. It's going to be exciting running towards the end of the season but all the competing teams get a great deal of credit. The real winner is the Premier League and all the fans who watch it. Oh and btw, Lee Judges is the most honest and knowledgeable fan of all . Big up to Lee.
Same old arsenal haha
Arsenal are a fantastic young team..... I've said all yeta they don't keep clean sheets when city and Liverpool were on top they used win 10 in a row and 8 or 9 clean sheets 2 or 3 nil wins arsenal at home against Liverpool and United conceded 2 goal each time liverpool had half there team and arsenal needed a ref to get over the line
Last team you want chasing you is man city……
English fans as ever. DEMANDING PERFECTION.  I wonder how u run your families with that kind of mentality.
Already turning after 3 games the arsenal fan base is actually horrendous
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
You should be Lee, your title dream is over. Arsenal played decent football, but there is not enough juicy in that team. It's time for old school AFTV with rants on daily basis.
If Arsenal win the league I'll give up smoking and become a none
03:38 Oolagard?
I can’t believe arsenal fans genuinely believed they were gonna win the league💀
Much needed humbling
The moment I saw arsenal sit back in the 2nd half and not really pressure the defenders I sensed danger....and arteta did not respond on the touchline
Does Lee know he's wearing a women's jacket? 🤣
I said Ode and Saka were jaded after the United game. It’s very evident last 3 games
Our attack is so stale now. He needs to drop Nketia. Will keep saying it. Put Tross in for Eddie.
Two lessons not strong enough in first eleven ,no strength  on bench, ,,sorry but look at last few games,newcastle ,everton, brentford ,city twice ,, and boy are we in trouble
Legend has it that they’ve won the quadruple
Manchester city is going to go harder now the are on top let's watch how the league goes hehe... if your a football lover check my page and also help it grow please 🙏❤️
I said we should have signed Chris wood on loan in January. 6ft3 lump just head the ball. Jesus I don’t think it makes a difference him coming back he doesn’t score. Our cb are shaky concede every game. We need bodies . Imagine zaha coming in for saka , Tony or a wood for Eddie . We always do this feb/March.
Lee is right,martinelli was starved of the ball,if we were being out played or being pressed in the midfield,kick it above the midfield & send it to either saka,or martinelli.
Arsenal can't win anything with the likes of xhaka he is useless 💩👎 drop xhaka play zinyy over him but I ain't coach arteta is too stubborn to experiment anything .
We do this every February / March.  We don’t have any depth. Viera is just pointless having him. We’ve got 2 strikers who one doesn’t score in Jesus and the other Eddie is hit n miss. People saying oh saliba has changed our defence we’ve conceded in what every game? 90 percent of games we concede.
AFTV is baaaack! love it.
All of you said City style will be better for you. I was laughing because you can't be pep with is own style. I knew city will come to Arsenal and march on easily
I love watching these videos of Lee and Robbie it feels like we are on this together. Good for the moral I hope we can turn this around I really do. Thank you for lifting my spirit ❤️
Worried ? Did arsenal Fans think they’re gonna win the league 🤦🏽‍♂️arsenal having a lucky season cos team like Chelsea , Liverpool and Man U having a dodgy season inoculating Man City who are not good as they’re last 4 seasons
L.
Gunner rattle come big game how to win cup 2 slip n tis look we endup 3/4
Do guys think it's easy to beat city?
"DID NOT MIX THINGS UP!"  This is what I have been looking for in all these commentaries that I haven't seen. I had to wait for Lee because I know he sees these kind of fundamental things. Arteta let the team down yesterday. Changes could have been made early, there were great options on the bench. Even White can play as a nmba 4 and penetrate this City side, Jorginho wasn't doing that. Even the new defender maybe could have come in for Gabriel, long ago. BTW same  White cud have  come in for Gab and the new defender who is great in possession comes in as nmba 4 bcos he plays nmba 4 too.  Nmba 4: def mid
Me too
I'm just so gutted after that second half performance yesterday We literally threw away all three points and City didn't even have to work really hard for the goals they scored Ngl, I've never felt this depressed and weakened after losing a football match in my entire life and right now, I've lost all confidence The guys at the stadium gave 110% screaming out their lungs only for us to give away silly goals in the game Even when they scored 3 goals, the fans were still at it but they team still didn't try hard enough to get another goal
Lee is right. We should be worried. Playing from the back against City especially in the 2nd half was stupid and disrespectful.
As I predicted back in November and reiterated at the end of December - failure of Jan transfer window will see Arsenal crumble from Feb onwards.... The title challenge is over when the crunch time of the season arrives. Close to £700M spent in last 3 seasons and a squad thin on quality as it was in Feb last season. And Arteta needs to mix it up. Play Trossard and Martinelli up front. Bench Nketiah. Reinstate Tierney and bench Zinchenko who has been crap in the last few games.
Why we don't  Play hard as a team,we don't have mentality,why we don't Play contrattack,why we don't Play slide tackle Like Martinez
Arteta out!!! How can you have xhaka, jorginho and martineli in your starting 11.  He sold pepe number 19 then went on to by trossard number19: okay which is better pepe or trossard? Many will say pepe.  Why is it arsenal only have 1fit striker?  I said this before arsenal will not win the premier league if xhaka in the team.  Arteta want to be like pep, I see that they both don't like African players if they have options they will get rid off all the African players.
the bottling is beginning
I can literary see that something is wrong inside the dressing room. Arteta is losing that dressing room, it was impossible for this to happen consecutively. There is untold story behind the scenes.
We need Tierney on the left. He overlaps and works well with Martinelli.  The left back is dead. And this has affected Martinelli's   game.
As a City fan this bloke talks perfect sense, he knows football and his team.
Did he just mention United bringing in Weghorst as if they didn't get Jorginho and Trossard in January?
Good to see Lee humble for a change 💩he seems to have lost his early season smugness, it is all downhill from now on 😭🤡
Chokers FC . Sit Down.
The fans will ultimately cost the team the league,  all the negativity has come back and it will spread as the pressure mounts , they will probably end up third . Such a shame cause they play some lovley football ⚽️
Arsenal tv is back 🤣🤣
I'm not sure Arsenal will make it not at all
Lee Judges, the man with the beanie and parker, A proud gooner, he's no Arsenal faker. On Arsenal Fan TV, he'll give you the scoop, And his honest opinions will make you regroup.  He knows how to judge a game and its result, With a sharp mind that's never dull or insult. Jaded is his favourite word, he'll say with a sigh, But he won't give up hope, he'll always give it a try.  He worries about Xhaka and injuries too, And his concern for Arsenal is always true. He'll be interviewed outside the stadium gate, And he'll tell you straight, he won't exaggerate.  A cockney lad, he's true to his roots, And he loves Arsenal, that's where his heart shoots. Lee Judges, the man who knows the game, A true gooner, his passion is never tame.
I'm not worried  I'm happy coys
New drinking game: every time Lee says “like you know” down a shot, you’ll be shitfaced every gameday.
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
Blaming coach now 🤣🤣🤣🤣last week hes was the best coach ever
Arsenal bubble burst a few weeks ago against Everton 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 boys against men against MAN CITY
I said a month ago city will take 6 points off arsenal,I think citys experience will get them wins over arsenal,arsenal fans right now🥴
They had the wowning
Your titles in trouble, Nketiah in the box
The majority of you blew your muck thinking it was won..........even with a 2 month break for WC. Delusional   Credit to Lee...I might be wrong but he was only one who wasnt running his mouth.
Still think arsenal can win the league not over yet
How many months till Arsenal fan are screaming “arteta OUT”?
Don’t worry Arseholes - you’ve already won the title 😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Booooooottler fc BACK AGAIN
Arsenal should have got joa felix and got outbidded by Chelsea being top of league he looks quality for Chelsea. The kronkes have let club down for years having nketia upfront alone have cost arsenal as well as the sloppy defender's
Lee "it's not good enuff" Judges
U lot got above your station , running your mouths up every chance u get I’m glad city put u lot back in your box . Let’s me fair your in nose bleed territory
Back to reality.. I wasn't coming to this channel for a long time..
When you're fatigued it affects concentration which leads to poor decision-making and mistakes which happened in the game.  Aretha needs to be braver with rotation starting at Villa, got to use the likes of Trossard, and Nelson and give the Polish lad his debut. The Boys in midfield look very jaded and fell away in the second half. That siege mentality needs to now be engendered the anger at decisions going against us needs to be turned into positive energy that everyone feeds off. Fans need to stay positive still a long way to go.
Our weak link is Gabriel has been all season people need too stop making excuses for him
This is not time to become sissies. Let's accept that we were under pressure due to the previous referee hating decision making.  Tonight our defence was left hanging on the lines. Man City was always going to outsmart us. We needed to have another formation to fall to. 4-2-3-1. This system I think would have worked and then field some of the defenders on the bench a CDM's. He needed to gamble with the new CB signing. Arsenal is composed but we can't deny that the previous game encounter did affect them.
As a Man Utd fan this is the arsenal we know and have loved for many years.
To be fair the grass was wet it had been raining
Waiting for the  bubble to bust
This game was always a six pointer as the race is close  , the question is is it a decisive game ,no if and a big IF !, can the Gunners keep it to the end for the extra game , it may well come to that.  Defensively a wake up call  yet again, for those at the back who were in honesty a sleep far to often and perhaps we could also say the chances for Nketah to hold that position  are running out fast.
As a gooner for nearly 40 years , tonight's game was a good test . Truth is too many fans believe Arsenal are better than we really are . That said , the team has improved massively from where we were this time last season . COYG
Hahaha hahaha   . Arrogant the lot of yous. Arent as good as what you think end of
Arsenal were never winning the league! One day hopefully
This isn't unfair absolutely spot on. We were so sloppy 😃 need to win against Villa because if we don't we might find ourselves further down the table than second 🥈
2 things guaranteed in life . Death and arsenal bottling it!
Ha ha 😂it’s all going pear 🍐 shaped for the gunners.
Not like most but something tells me it's definitely not all over just yet. Long way to go and no more pressure on us to maintain top of the table. We arent clinical enough, Eddie did well but need to hit the target on all 3 of those chances.
Gabriel Jesus back soon 🙏 are only hope
People who trying to compare arteta with Mr wenger are clueless about football
Love to see arsenal bottle it 😂😂😂
Crumble FC
welcome back to reality.
The problem with medical tampering is that there comes a time when you have to stop doing it. Look at what it's done to Liverpool.
Did Arsenal really think they gonna win the league 😂😂
Skills pays bills
Assna in the MUDryk lol we have martineli we don’t need mudryk we have eddie he’s doing good we don’t need to overpay for felix bla bla delusional arsenal fan base delusional robbie we don’t have to overpay ohh we are saving wages cheap ass edu jan window killed arsenal dreams are u now y’all happy with the jan window who were rating it good ??!
As an arsenal fan I'm wondering where we will get enough points to keep in the top 4. It looks difficult to get 3 at villa... Hoping to get those points but I don't think we will.
I am here for the meltdown 😂😂
Hopefully saturday will be a good ebening
So nice to have the real AFTV back
And why is Trossard not starting in these games? or at least early in the second half?
Goldbridge jinxed u 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 get ur banners Out.
City fan here.   Teams dont dominate City. Arsenal battered us. We had to go long ball to win. Never seen us play like that b4. Trust Arteta he is gold.
2:20 that stutter says it all 😂😂😂
Martinelli was poor, stop it! He did nothing, know he is your favourite but subbing him was good, Trossard over him, Martinelli needs to be benched to get his hunger back.   Subs needs to happen quicker, but even start Vieira possibly.
Arsenal fans are the only fans who keep winning
Couple of Stella’s got downed
Game over bottle jobs
Drop Eddie Nketiah,Martinelli to move in the middle and Trossard on the left it should remain like that untill Gabriel Jesus comes back.
Yeah they’re exhausted
Have you all noticed that Arsenal haven’t won a game since they signed Jorginho. This isn’t new. Arsenal bottled 4th place last season and Nketiah isn’t the striker that will take arsenal to the title
We had moments but we learn and we move on. Missed jesus today but still games where we need to get the wins back in. Changes were needed in the squad but heck better to grow and be equal second with game in hand and hopefully start a run and find the balance. We are jaded so up to the management side of things now. Jorginho played well today
This guy knows football. Honest, unbiased opinion. Lee is a credit to AFTV
Eddie is not a 2‘nd class striker we need a dirty roof attacker!
From winning the pl to challenging for the pl to making it to top four to finally finishing in europa...arsenal fans have come a long way....
Fabio Vieira for Xhaka by no means acceptable
Arsenal now need 13wins, 2draws and 1 loss to gain 92points enough to win the league.  Today's loss was a humbler. Tomorrow will be better. Let pick ourselves up and put on a fresh approach big energy. We will get back to winning ways again and possible win the title Let's go gunners❤❤❤❤⚽️⚽️⚽️⚽️⚽️⚽️
Ya worried because ya worried 😂😂
Gabriel Magalhaes and Oleksandr Zinchenko play their worst game of the season. Gabriel was nervous for 90 min. we lost the game because of them.
1 game a week still struggling same old arsenal 😂 6 weeks man United Wil be above you ! Remover this comment come back and like it when it happens !
I think we win today if we had Jesus or Balogun. Eddie had so many good chances and didn't even get a shot on target.
We know Lee wants to say more...I'm tired of the Kroneke's and Arteta not having a plan B. We need to step up and win on Saturday or it's game, set and match. This is a joke.
Eddie missed hatrick of chances.  Can't wait for Gabriel Jesus to return.
No fa cup no champions league they must be tired
Let's have it right. Prime klopps Liverpool is better than this arsenal team and they lost 2x titles by a point. Arsenal won't go the full way
Break!  Bullshit
Guys let's calm down. Jesus will soon be back and will go again
"I'd still be happy with Top 4 FC"
We don't have striker
Aftv such entertainment everytime arsenal looses.
Top 4 was the target this year ,anything else a bonus
Trossard and Tierney should come in. Xhaka and Martinelli dropped. Zinchenko moved to midfield.
Tomi had an absolute stinker
Jaded???? Lol United are in four competitions and played twice a week since the World Cup.
Gabriel was exposed today.
If u don't score goals u don't win games.. That's what usually happens btw Arsenal vs ManC.. u can't keep wasting ur chances & expect ur opponent to do same when they do have theirs'.. Lee actually spoke facts about the game! I expect Arsenal players to be shooting (they were doing that in the first half of the season, but they've stopped doing that).
Changes should have been made earlier
Villa in the heads of Arsenal
Lee's analysis really is amazing and spot on. Really enjoy his unbiased and open views. Comes across very well. Get him on match of the day lol
No ty for interview as he's still clapping the Saka goal
Ultimatlee Judges
As an Everton fan, I said after our game your team have a weak mentality. Its starting to play out
Worried? This is predictable happens every season why are we worried? We ain’t won the league for 20 years, fans need to wake up to the reality!
spot on Lee
Exactly what lee said at the end look where we was last season and now this season be proud 👏
The Difference Between NKETIAH and HAALAND..HAALAND look for options and quick to react.. Nketiah can't pass the ball to Nketiah at least he gets Assists
I used to pray for time like this
there's nothing to worry about baldermort, the leagues done, just focus on qualifying for Europe through Europa league because arsenal are gunna be 5th/6th
Haha bottle jobs
Its actually nice to hear a fan be honest for once
Lee has been saying what we needed to fix from the start but everyone was just telling him to be positive. We can be positive and level headed at the same time. Let's go and win. It's not over
Gabby constantly held on to the ball. Frustrated the life outa me
Gotta love Lee. By far the best on AFTV
Got caught up in trying to play,at 1-1 the team should have settled down. Zinchencko heads goes when we're not ahead he needed to let jorginho dictate the play more   The defence chose to play clever rather than just do the basics Going forward match management needs to be alot better
Its honestly over. We will drop points against Aston Villa as well. We have seen how we drop points in a bunch last season. Cant be too critical though, we have been exceptional the whole season. But Lee is a whiner though, Mike is doing an exceptional job. He isnt as experienced as Pep and that's what the difference was
Always referencing Man Utd, rattled. Not one since your cup final against us! 😂😂😂
Every team has its time when performance is down,,,I think right now is Arsenal time but not for long
Martinelli can't do nothing wrong in this guys eyes. He hasn't played well in the last couple of games.
Not winning the league now are ya 😂😂
Only here for Ty we’re is he? Arsenal robbed by VAR again I think not there was gifted a penalty and then slapped up
This is the AFTV I remember 😂back where they belong
Is everyone delusional!! Our defence is based on shutting down teams in their own half with consistent and hard pressing. WHICH NKETIAH DOES NOT DO, let alone finishing the chances provided to him or even worse drop to create the chances that Jesus does. Gabriel and Saliba are not the issue! Nketiah needs to be dropped and Trossard needs to slip in as a false 9 to create space for our wingers to run at the defence. Thats what makes us so good when Jesus plays. Nketiah is destroying the whole composition of the team and the gameplan. I blame Arteta for having some kind of blind loyalty to him. I have feel so sorry for Martinelli as he is being made to look bad because he is not supported. Its infuriating.
LETS ALL LAUGH AT BANTER FC HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
Xhaka and saka both had clear chances
I hear a lot of the Arsenal players have been approached my beverage companies to be bottlers.
the difference was they had HAARLAND
Arsenal fans moaning because they have to play once a week! Man Utd been playing 3 times a week since Xmas!
Bottlers FC , will finish 5th
FINGGGGG get in the judge man I respek dat ALL ARSENAL FANS LETS B PROUD  COYG
Why you only showing old clips....oh wait, this was yesterday's game.
Saka still in ake pocket since that fa clash
Arsenal got humbled 😂
Watching the first video of AFTV all season. Hopefully, more to come.
'We played our B team in the FA cup and City barely beat us, we'll smoke them at the Emirates'..🤦🏽‍♂️
Villa away and Leicester away, we won't take 6 points out of them 2 games
Nkethe should had been taken off when he got a yellow. Easting chances left and right ffs. Trossard should have been in the middle with Martinelli and Saka
No matter what happens this season it will be a fantastic season for us. We are a young team and every season we will be stronger. These are young guys and they are just learning.
From what i see,Arsenal  is definately  sliding down in performance and look that  with it performing,for sure at the  end of the season , Arsenal looks likely ended  in third position.For years ,i was following how Arsenal play, in the 2bd half of the EPL season,it  always did going down ,because its tactics and strategy is nothing new!
20 times 🎉
Until Gabriel learns to mature as a defender we will always have problems with potential teams. Arteta scored 2/10  today
We need a backup striker, Eddie Nketiah is bullshit
I thought yous won the league in January 🤣😂😂
How are Arsenal Jaded they play 1 game a week
Jorjinxho
Calm down, everyone, we will win the league the games where we drop points we shouldn't have. This fame was always going to be the one we will not win. Martinelli needs to do more, and we need to move him on. He is done nothing for the team. I am not worried we will be good guys back the team we were not out played
City cup loss started rot. Always play strongest team. We ve done brilliant this season. But not to be too negative, i think its over. To many mistakes. Look tired.If we make Top 4, we'll be doing well.
Arsenal effed up again in the summer and January. This has literally happened at least 7 times in 10 years. If only we had 2/3 extra top players. It's unacceptable
Lee said after the FA cup defeat that city would be really worried 🤔
Insightful, objective and on point
Christ, its not tonight's game, it was Everton and Brentford screwed us. Up front we're all of a sudden doing nothing !
I thought u beat city with your first 11?
Trossard should have started over Martinelli..
we mzee!
So you should be Lee . City will absolutely Romp their way to another title now and every gooner knows it 🤣
Still a banter club
First and foremost Arteta’s style of playing is too predictable. And  I don’t think if Nketieh could be the answer if in fact we want to compete the tittle With City/United.Simple
Drop Nketia play Trossard in he's place. He does nothing up front. City will stumble don't lose faith
With Nketiah yon can‘t win the league!
Try having Uniteds schedule then come back with ya excuses complaints whatever yz call it
assna fans right now are mourning 🤣🤡
Martinelli has flopped hard recently, don’t see this team winning any games at the moment, absolute shambles of a team.
We need proper investments, we need to force Kroneke to sell the club. Our squad to small.
Need Jesus back ASAP. I've been saying since day 1 that if you want to win the league you can't have Eddie as your main striker. He simply isn't elite level.
It’s not looking good brev 😊
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🎉😂😂😂😂😂😂🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Can Arsenal finish in top 3? I think United will finish second
We will end up coming 3rd.   City  United Arsenal
Bottle jobs. 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Gabriel is Arsenal's weakest link. He's too clumsy and switches off from time to time in game.
As a neutral, I really think arsenal's defense let them down. Especially on that left side, everyone was coming down Zinchenko's side, him and Gabriel were just having absolute shockers...failed to close Haaland down for that third goal, it was shocking......I still hope arsenal can win the league, because we hate city 🤣🤣🤣
I only come here when Arsenal lose
The sooner jesus comes back the better.
Back to the AFTV we all know and love 😂😂
Enjoy these moments. Take it one game at a time.
For the first time this season, this team's 2nd half performance had me jaw stuck as if I just had a bad news like......😯, 👋🏽😔🔥
That had silva at left bck lol u guys r same old same old
This guy is always worried 🤣🤣🤣
Why do I feel Lee is the only guy on aftv that is talking sense
So, it appears that the high point of the season was the win against United. The last time Arsenal won a game. Now, United have been allowed into the title race. It’s a 3 way fight.
We've been patient for so long, finally, we get the aftv we all love.
Arsenal are bottlers pure and simple its in there dna,they will win nothing as usual ,they are becoming a laughing stock
the breakdown this year will be extraordinary
Whos waving back now you clown
You can expect every home team to play better especially when they are down 1-0 or 2-1
Alright firstly can I just say nketia is well on his way to being a good goal poacher he gets in dangerous positions that header was very close good technique so of course when Jesus is back he starts but I’m more optimistic about nketia than before, secondly saka is now able to handle pressure better and clever with drawing fouls , however and I repeat week in week out, the keeper the first goal, he should’ve been further back and calling for the pass , he can see where de Bruyne is not tomi, so if he’s asking for the ball trying to help tomi then either his position is way further back so that tomi can play a harder stronger pass away from danger, or he positions himself more towards the right so that the pass isn’t close to de bruyne and tomi passes keeper clears, if he’s in a bad position and attacker is in front of him don’t call for the ball, and only the keeper not tomi can see de bruyne because tomi is occupied trying to deal with winger, it’s poor poor judgement. Second goal ok took minor deflection but if anything the deflection slowed the ball down and the shot was central and easy range, I probably would’ve been able to reflex kick save the ball away. Other parts of the gave he gave needless corner near half time when he could’ve caught the ball, another time very soft header should’ve caught it, flapped it back in danger area. We can still win this we have a game in hand but turner has to be between the sticks. Also too much faith in ziny , bring back tierney he linked very well with martineli. Also if keeper didn’t clatter into nketia the way he did then his shot would’ve crossed the line, meaning that wasn’t just a pen, it was a second yellow by default. So we were robbed this week of 2 points brentford and potentially and probably 3 points today. And this is again an example of not human error, an example of officials not understanding their jobs
This is going to be gold
Arsenal shaking chicks play with man city next game not sure arsenal will get 3 points from aston villa good luck
Hmm 🤔  Our team seems to have run out of legs!  Let us hope the comeback kids will have a spark towards the end!!
Just the gooners doing what they do best 🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡😂😂😂 bottle jobs
Realistically squad wise and experienced Arsenal were far from winning it.. Could go to Arsenal way if front 3 knew how to bury those key chances
this feels so sweet 😂😂😂
Dissapointing result, but in our current form, we didn't stand a chance😑
assna is city's bitch , they were our bitch but we passed it to city. 11 loses in a row in the prem? 💀
Comes back to the January transfer window we should have brought in more quality signings
A team is as good as the board & Management that constitutes it. What is Folarin Balogun doing in France when we are striking starved. It is wrong to make Arsenal look like it is owned by a clique of players and without whom Arsenal is dead. Ten Hag is months old what does Arteta have in comparison.
Lee Judges,  is going on and on about Nkieta, WHATS WRONG WITH US NOT SIGNING IVAN TONEY.... & ZAHA
The entire league has held Arsenal’s cojones for months now, it’s only fair City have a turn.
ARTETA, S TO BLAME FOR THIS DEFEAT...
Arsenal will win EPL this season.i have seen a team that is strong on all departments.we just need a touch in front of goal
What a surprise………not! Arsenal doing their annual bottling job. Clowns
Don’t have to b worry.  Arsenal. Don’t  have a  strong bench   Boys r tired   City  r man. N their bench  r strong
I know the Brits will always support Nkettia buh let Martinelli lead the line, Trossard replace him at the wing and it's high time that goalie got benched.
We haven't beat City in the league for the 14th time shame
we need jesus and smith rowe back asap
Good ol’ Assna is back!!
im utd fan but listen to lee honest fan an calls it way it is
Play KT and bench Zinchenko. In games like this we need a proper LB. Zinny was terrible.
Only shot on target was a dodgy pen.
As a United fan I missed this chanell
We hope finish 2nd or 3rd. Man united not loosing. City are back number 1. Be real no striker.
Eddie can not finish on top level.
Heard they had the warning?
The thing that should worry Arsenal is they did not actually play that bad. But City just flexed their muscles and showed them where their level actually is.
Reality check
We will win premier league arsenal
Give up going you keep changing your mind. Worst pundit on the show, none of the players are jaded their professional athletes for goodness sake.
They are BACK, the AFTV WE LOVE! \
Bernardo Silva left wing back thou
Ty completely forgets about AFTV after a loss lmao
Ha ha ha were Man City we cheat when we want now leave the football to the big boys ha ha deluded prick’s
bottlers
Shades of aftv of the previous years finally coming through again 😂😂😂
when assna lost a game.. robbie be checking his bank account..
Lads, please take a moment to appreciate the quality AFTV content returning.
Look at all the desperados trying to get on camera.
Default settings activated for Arsenal! Can't see us coming back from this..Lee hit the nail on the head, squad has no depth and we definitely miss a world class striker up from...Arteta will never defeat Pep...his ultimate nemesis!
Arteta being scapegoated 4 the defeat...What a surprise 🙄
Arsenal are back
how many Arsenal fans are hoping Man City would get deducted points with this alleged thing man city being investigated for ? LoL that's the only way I can see Arsenal winning the league this season.  I can see Man City still going to drop points .  All to play for . Many more twists yet to come & plenty of points to play for
Arsenal: CHOKERS  Arsenal: BOTTLERS  Arsenal: LOSERS  Arsenal: I can see the CHAMPIONSHIP  ME: 🤔🤔🤔🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Loser arsenal will not get the league
Let arsenal sign some good defender's the one we have rightnow  they aren't  performing
How much do you guys pay those fans to act like they give a fuck?
It's over
Zinchenko forgot he is playing for arsenal, dude just offering chances to city
Arsenal will keep on losing so long as Nketiah is in the first 11
The beginning of the end is here.   And now the painful descent into 5th place shall commence.
When eddies in from am not confident
I think zin doesn't like martinelle, how many times he passed the ball to martinelle. He only choose to play him when martinelle not in the good position to attack.
This is what happens when you don't get players we need and get cheap options, we needed a physically imposing midfielder and another striker we should have recalled balogun arsenal will regret not doing what was needed in the transfer window now it's a battle for top 4.
Where's that gift shop
There's no reason to be worried. Everybody knew that this would happen. Let's just hope that we would finish in the top3 so we'd get in to the Champions League.
😂😂😂😂
I knew why var ruins arsenal drop point so bad 😞
bye bye  🤣🤣 small  club
2nd time this season watching AFTV. Robbie is surely hoping for more nights like this……bills need paying😂
Arteta please use your head martinelli should not be subbed... what about Tierney... Gabriel and xhaka Nooo...saliba needs so'ne good like him not a shaky Mangalese 🖕 ahhhh some players are just tired we need the joginho energy
bye  bye   you  cry   you  smal club  ... this is your fate
Lee has two fings that bova him .
arsenal   small  club  ... they   run   always  and  then ... boooommmmm   you  wish
Back to default settings
The worst thing about the defeat is that its not even like they really opened us up it was our own mistakes that cost us
City will win league  arsenal will push but will fall short  was hoping some one else wins the league but city always find away got strength  through out there squad  arsenal haven’t but like to see someone else win the league then. City  Manchester United. Next year will be top dogs again
Lee you should be worried because it's over now, now Man city is going to destroy every game and win the league, Man city you're simply the best, 💃
God I've missed this... hopefully the losses continue now ... COYS :)
Played week in week out? Come on Rashord has been playing much more. Stop finding excuses.
Truth be told we need a classy number 9 to team up with Jesus,Nketiah misses a lot of goals for a striker
Forget about the title. This Arsenal team is not mature enough to be champion.
There is nothing to be worried  about. Arsenal will easily make top 4 as should have been their aim at the beginning of the seasob
Robbie stop promoting Eddie, not at this level, his not the main guy. His great against the mid table, lower teams. We need better quality!
United playing more games every week with a weaker team but don’t hear us complaining
Sooooo many games to go! You ain’t winning the league! You’re tired, jaded, out of ideas and you’re getting figured out already! One or 2 injuries and you’ll fall even further…
Ah here we go again. Yes we’ve still overachieved but I’m worried this is the start of a decline and we’ll end up 3rd or 4th or even worse
Elephant is coming down finally.
Two mistakes and chances miss  costs us the match ...its not Mikel's fault but errors from individual ...
what response, the ref gave you guys a soft penalty. 😂😂😂
It’s good to be back on aftv channel after this defeat for arsenal 😂
ITSSSSS TIIIIIMMME TOOO GOOOOOOO!!!!!
Where is that df tye now 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 INVINCIBLES
Banter era coming back?
Arsenah being very Arsey
Arsenal stopped pressing after 60 minutes. While City changed gears when pep brought Bernado on the front right.  Arsenal should be worried if I'm being honest. Once City have stones back and Foden finding his form....they will be farming the league again.
HA HA HA HA YOUS WAS NEVER IN A MILLION YEARS ‘GUNNER’ WIN THE LEAGUEB💙💙💙💙🥶🥶🥶🥶💙💙💙💙🥶🥶🥶🥶
This was inevitably. Arsenal fans was out here like they already won the league.
I think we are done man we given league to City man😔
Lol our manager is beyond average. How many games we were waiting for him to show us something different. Lol 😂  sack him even if he wins something. This small club city become tough for a decade after that investment. Whoever owns Arsenal Is criminal and is not rich enough.
The team look lost today
This is the first  I'm watching Aftv all Season
Don’t worry. Lemme tell you this. Arsenal WILL NOT win the league. That’s the reality 😂
“Take us seriously..!!!” Remember who said this not long ago.? 😂 Have you lot got a grip on reality yet.? 😂😂
Ever since pep has joined city ,  13 game 12 wins 1 draw  And 11 straight wins 😂😂 Come on city 🏙
The problem was with our finish!! Eddie cost us this win!
Him and Robbie are the only ones who talks sense out of all these mugs on here
We are back to the same old story 🤣🤣🤣
Paul Merson only 4 weeks ago……I honestly can’t see anybody catching this Arsenal team, obviously back on the piss hey Paul 😂😂 you’ll be lucky to make top 4 on recent performances you’ve bottled it big time
Deduct points for cheaters.
I guess there wont be anymore stupid questions from Robbie about can we win the title with 30 points still to play for.   Arteta is clearly useless when it comes to squad rotation, team selection and substitutions.  Arsenal have become predictable.
Big bro had to humble little bro. Arsenal’s only shot on target was Saka’s penalty;  0 shots on target from open play against an out of form City team. Let that sink in…
Arteta has no idea that 'Wenger Out' version of Arsenal fans is approaching him slowly but surely 😂
Aaaand  back down to earth 😂
Battered by the big boys
Seriously ..for 3-4 games. We look absolutely horrendeous and slopy.We aint playing like we used to do.. maybe its the end :/
missing old AFTV
🎶TAKE YOUR TIME WIT IT🎶  Arteta OUT!!! 🤣      GGMU 😩🤣
Arsenal manager, as a fan of Arsenal FC please change the line-up (Jorginho) if possible sell them bcoz Jorginho was super flop active
How many city fans are here rn ?🤣
This game was an indication of how the rest of the season will go. First half Arsenal were great and controlled the play but didnt take advantage of their dominance. Second half City moved some players around and changed their tactics and just had too much for Arsenal. This showed that Arsenal wont have enough to sustain their first half of the season performance. City just have too much experience, too much quality and too many resources. Its horrible but its just facts.
FOR SURE EVEN ME I'M WORRIED, THE SQUAD IS SHORT.
😄😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆
What a banana 🍌
Arsenal played like they haven’t got breastfed 🤱 we give to much credit to this kids 🤬🤬
And robbie thinks zincenko is better player than licha🤣
Summary.  Only one shot on goal , city six.  Defence poor , attack poor , second half battered. World class manager plays the game. Arteta falls over. Big loss.
Where's Ty?
Back to good old aftv. Where they belong. So good
My favorite therapy aftv
Chill y’all !! We’re gonna be good - let’s go Arsenal - I trust the players & Manager - Simple as !
Not the defence need a striker like ohsimen
BANTER FC BACK AGAIN
Villa away is our next game, worried we wount bounce back. Disappointed if we lose the league to city who aren't are their best would be a shame. Cause who knows when we will win the league next
I don't understand why people are worried and stressed and critical about how we played. I think we played very well today, it was just individual mistakes. Man city has never wasted time in the game but in the first half they were wasting time and we have the same points with man city with a game in hand. Arteta need to take out eddie and play martineli in the middle and trassard on the left
This is lovely Assnal
Would've thrown Zinchenko in the mid and bring on Tierney 2ND Half .
We aren't hungry enough for goals like earlier on
Spot on comments from Lee. We're happy to be in the position we're in! Contenders for the Premiership. No one expected it and we are definitely not finished! COYG:)
Humble pie to yall gunners😄🙌😄 Punished buy a class finish 👌
What happened thought you had already won the league hahahhahahaha
Back to aftv as it should be, but to be fair since the Everton match I haven’t seen you lot with the same fight and hunger you had before the new year… before you have up a goal every chance every tackle was a solidified squad together with hunger and fight I just haven’t seen that over the past couple matches from you lot that would be a worry if I was an arsenal fan… it’s still in your hands though on a positive
All NOT OVER
Need to pick up they was flying start season
My Liverpool of 1-3 years ago would've smoked that City side, they were avg and they beat you man 3-1 tf lmao
I am an Arsenal fan but today the better team won. Arsenal is winless in last 4 games. Old defense problems are coming back. Top 4 place is now at risk.
I’ve missed arsenal fans suffering
Nobody wants give the ball to Martinelli. I hope Gabriel Jesus comeback for the next match. Jesus and Martinelli plays better together.
Imagine playing once every week and complaining about fatigue. Man U still playing in 4 competitions and playing every 3 days. Get over it
5 games ago they were champions lol arsenal won't finish top 4 next season either
Complaining about fatigue.. 1 game a week? Cmon
The elephant 🐘 arsenal fell off the tree. Was a matter of time 😂😂😂😂
You are not the manager don't just compliant,No need to be worries.Arsenal is not there yet .don't blame the players .man city is good quality player with huge investment .money make the difference
arteta has to try something else, players look stale  and out of ideas
Pointless giving martinelli the ball against walker ...
Nketiah should never start again
Zinny sold us. He moved the ball too slow & his overall decision making was poor. Tomi definitely needed Thomas for coverage cause mans had nothing. What does Tierney have to do to get a game?. I know we were going to lose from the starting 11 but not like that. Plus when teams are pressing us & our players aren't coming back for the ball why df you gine play out from the backline noooooo get the ball up the field forget possession oh my word. Ramdale when we getting full man press & our team is moving the ball slow please kick the ball up the field not to the backline when mans down there neck....I seen ppl blame xhaka but honestly man cleared the ball many times when there was no other option( smart move). Overall zinny needed to overlap martinelli he got ate out there even tossard got ate out there too. Why Arteta eyes in an eclipse that he couldn't make those subs & changes to his game .
Hes dressed up like Captain james cook from the Antarctica even though his captain spock from Star trek 🤣
Assna typical
The faces of panic is hilarious. Business as usual for Arsenal
Voldemort should be worried
odegard was the worst on the pitch, plus we needed energy in midfield. cnt believe arteta didnt  change the formation or tactic, pep changed his formation and he won the game simple. teta need to see these things, put tross closer to eddie, give city something to worry about, city too comfy in second half!!!!
*The play put from the back was horrible far to slow too many back passes.  *Spent to much time thinking about passing instead of ACTUALLY passing  *Not 1 willing to take a shot *Not 1 willing to press with 1 2s  Honestly this team has been very poor for 5 weeks This was a MUST WIN after 4 previous royal fk ups and now it's at a stage were Arsenal are no longer in control. U would think the way arsenal have been last month that they have no interest in winning anything.
He’s right, Arsenal are a horrible 2nd half team. The numbers don’t lie, they need to look in the mirror
Your Prem is in trouble... Man City in the room!
You not worried yet mate 🤣🤣🤣🤣
I told u. Eddie was poor/bad player. Bench him. Trossard in. Or martinelli as a striker. Trossard LW.
Haha 4 games no win ...
Try playing 3 games a week
Aftv views are picking up😂
When City played 3 at the back, we should not have played 2 CDM. Trossard should have came on for Xhaka at halftime. Xhaka was poor in attack today all game, but not his fault as it was not his natural position. Poor management from Arteta today. Not buying a Mudryk was a costly mistake.
Zinchenko plays for Zinchenko
Were the 2nd best team in this League I would never have believed that 2/3 seasons ago ....COYG
You all change tune quicker than a juke box
Trust the process, right? Sick, sick sick of listening to the fools who keep backing Arteta and this trust the process nonsense. He's lost us this title by being a bottle job. We'll never get another chance to win it. OUT NOW
Arteta should think about Zinchenko twice. Just saying
Bottle jobs 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Bottler FC as per normal. I ain't surprise ...
As a City fan I massively appreciate Lee’s objective comments, especially with whats come at our club this last week. Regardless of the allegations, it’s not the fans fault for any of it  Arsenal were brilliant in the first half, genuinely a cut above us. You were unlucky not to be ahead at the break, just defensive errors and a slightly stagnant response. I haven’t been as nervous as this for a game all season.  Finally a title race with a bit of banter, it’s been horrible against them lot the past few years 😂
As a city fan genuinely not trying to be cocky here but I’ve sensed major panic from Arsenal fans past week and it gave me confidence. Liverpool fans are very arrogant but I think it helps them in title runs as they feel they deserve to be there, I don’t sense that from arsenal and from what I’ve seen yous should be supremely confident tbh
You played well, but a couple of good chances missed, and two key players absent killed you. You can't be too jaded, to keep our possession stats at 36%. Lowest in the Pep era. Slight change of chemistry needed maybe?
Arteta Out !!!  😃🤣🤣
No need to be worried its just some silly mistake cost us
Stop moaning Lee. These boys have done very well so far. Support your boys through thick and thin. If Lee is good at coaching, why is he not coaching a club. Stop criticising Mikel; respect Mikel.
You should be worried judges. Lucky to finish in the top 4.
Stay positive guys and be proud of our team. Its bad couple of games. Gunner4life
Facts
Arse has gone!!! Not got a title winner In them be that the team or the fans!!!
I’m backkkk to give robbie some money
The return of the original AFTV 😂😂
We cannot win the league without thumping teams weekly..and we just havent been doing this sadly
Lee is the only one who's not delusional he speaks the truth
Thanks for the ' gifts'
Lee never gives city the credit always “we were the better team” you are 12-0 to city the last 12 games
Nketia isn't the  stricker for a club like Arsenal
Top 4 was the goal
After the FA cup match this guy said City will be worried of Arsenal and now LOL
That type of talk,let's enjoy it don't help the team or the coach.Tottenham beat City,it is not about a depleted squad,it is about the will of our coach&players to go the length.  Players have to look at their coach,and make a judgment.
What no one ever says is Arteta like Emery before him, is responsible for 11 spoilt kids who are all millionaires by the time their 20. 10/10 birds, all the cars, tattoos, houses, holidays and have NEVER been told… NO!  Anyone who teaches this generation know it’s mostly an IMPOSSIBLE job even at school. Imagine if these kids were richer and more entitled than the headteacher.  That’s the reality of the world we live in and football in just a sad reflection of that. Those players know they can get Arteta sacked easy as pie. And it’s not just arsenal we’ve seen it at countless clubs.
I’m gutted boys. It’s not over but I need to see a response on Saturday

Listen to you guys, told you Arsenal is a joke. I’ve been supporting this club from 08 and they can do nothing right.
The bell curve is curving to the other tail😂
Arsenal was never in a title race wtf, 4 last games L-D-L-L will loose against villa away also, and leicester away. I like Arsenal, but the manager is deluded, and the team is way too prone for injury,  1 or 2 players injured and your goal will be fighting for top 4.
As an Arsenal fan -  we will end up third or fourth.    It's simply the talent we have, but the rival fans that keep saying we are delluled are ridiculous.  Not one Arsenal supporter thought we had this in the bag.   Lovely to be here
Swear i always come to this channel to laugh if am down 😅,thanks ❤
Aftv is back finally😂😂
City don't lose many games, and you can't allow a team like City to go ahead of you. They're champions for a reason. This is a real wake-up  call for Arsenal
Surprised Arsenal fans are not blaming Lee Mason this time. Have they written a letter to the PL yet about some made up Ref decisions that didn’t go their way or are they doing it tomorrow first thing in the morning?☠️
900th like. Sad day at the office. Coyg
Slightly the better team??????? What you smoking busta
One shot on goal whole match. Stop making excuses.
Beating City at home isn't for everyone 😂
When is a going to end
Oddegard and saka are your best players 😂
Don't worry it's football coyg we have a game on hand ✋✋✋✋ Arsenal 4 ever
Banter fc coming back, Qatar taking over united.. Life can't get any better
QUIET!!! Hahahahaha
Finally back to watching with some popcorn 👀👀
Missed your whinning guys, Cheers
The Judge has gave his verict 👨‍⚖️
Just a shame Eddie isn’t Brazilian eh Robbie😂😂
All Edu's fault
Now I can start watching AFTV again. I'm here for the Ls.
This is what I’ve been waiting for all this season
Tiernay should have started better defensive wise especially against a Man City side
I want Man City to win the EPL for no reason other than I love watching AFTV when Arsenal loses.  I'm not even a football fan!
I dont know whats happened recently. Zinchenko, Saliba, White, Xhaka, Martinelli and Nketiah have been poor since after the Man United match. I think they are burnt out after playing so many matches.
Back to reality..  nketiah was good for that few weeks... week in n week out need to be an pure profesional performin ...
AFTV feeding off the negativity
We are back boys.
I love to see assnal fans crying
Arsenal got done by the short passes in front of their goalposts when they know City is good at high press
This mental collapse stems for arteta, he’s mentally weak Blaming anyone but himself
This is where AFTV make their money back.
This is the Arsenal fan base that i know 😂 One thing i wanna say is this team surprised me all the way. I never thought Arteta had it in him and i saw one guy who talked about how Arsenal helped him to recover from the depression and heart break of losing his brother i wish God heal all the wound brother and give you all the strength you need. Arsenal FC y'all should kept your mouth shut😂
Arsenal back to their default setting😂 well done Agent Jorginho🤣🤣🤣
City looked pretty good
So happy the woolwich have started to hit a bad patch they were always gonna bottle the league
Arsenal were 1 minute away from only getting 2 points from 12 available! Leagues gone now... focus on keeping top 4. I knew this lot would fall apart eventually 😂😂😂
Sometimes u should play from the back City players knew arsenal defenders would eventually make a mistake !
That was a performance from 2 years ago, says which I thought were long gone. No belief we could win the game, no creativity and riddled with individual errors again. We deserved nothing from the game but the least we could’ve done was make them work for the goals.
Eddie missed critical chances we needed him to bury 😔
mark my words...Start Zinchenko and Xhaka together. You will never win a game. Drop Zinchenko and put the Irish guy on and see the results change
DAMN I thought arsenal lost the cup on porpoise to be fresh for the league 😂 what a bunch of clowns nice run tho !!
I don’t understand that Tottenham can beat Man City but Arsenal can’t .
Bottle jobs
Just like old times
Don’t blow top 4. Were is KT?
You lot actually thought you was winning the league 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Hahahahhahhahah. Look how humble they've become now. Deluded bunch of clowns. I thought you'd won the league last month lmao.
This guy said they'll beat us at their gaff with chest 🤣 what happened? Got put in a spliff. 🤣  Top of the league BACK AGAIN. This is CITY!
Not a great side arsenal be honest yer not
AFTV is dead for me since Claude Ty days…. Haven’t watched in ages but I am back today first time in a long time and I hope I am back again once Arsenal bottle the league.
Tomiyasu needs to play sensible. He was reckless
Arsenal gonna do a Spurs and come 3rd in a 2 horse race 🤣🤣😂😂
Firstly I'm a mancunian Man City fan.  I must say to Arsenal fans that your team is so young and so good that you will win the EPL if not this season, then in the next 3yrs? I absolutely guarantee that you will.
Arsenal we know is back🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Let the excuses begin lol
Wow. Talk about bottleing it. Spurs have a few spare bottles if you want some.
You know it’s Peak when Lee Judges has got the Lee Judges 2020 look!
Arsenal fans surrender like no ones business. Already given up wow
Ha ha are they moaning again the most fickle fanbase in the premier league. What a joke .
Lee knows what he’s taking about. You were never gone win the league. Top 4 will be a good finish for you lot. Then next season, with signings, you may challenge Man City. We’re just too strong, mentally and the player have been there and done it.
We won't win anything at all. Don't worry about Europa we will slip out of that tournament quicker than Gerrard  😉 😀 😜 😄 😆 😁
Well said, I love this guy comments and ideas❤
It's  happening again. Grasping at straws again 😃
😂😂 a reality check …. Just be humble
Do you think you will make the top 4?
Same old, same old. "Arteta, Arteta, Arteta." Bore off mate
🤣🤣🤣🤣
Hihi
Bottlers FC slowly resurrecting. 😢
CITY THE BEST TEAM IN THE WORLD ARTETA SAID 😳😲😤 GET HIM OUT ASAP
Two Manchester club is coming because arsenal is sliping !!!
Bad loosers FC, got goddy far to soon, fat lady haven't even started garggling. No way was that a peno 😀. Always like Lee's comments, tells it true.  CTID 😀😉💙.
Take your time with it
Tired of these AFTV people- should all move to Jonestown and keep handing out the cool-aid
Arsenal were doing odd creative high risk defensive passing, completely unnecessary. If anything, leave all that creativity to passes forward. We lost today because of lapses in concentration and just not being clinical. Martinelli at this stage needs to be dropped, he’s just not offering anything
Ah Aftv how I've missed you
Get Mr Poland Kiwor and Trossard rotating with Martinelli next game, Get Gabriel and Nketiah on the bench
But you are scared though..
Haha
I've been seeing it in their eyes... Arteta, their fans and their team are spooked... They are all in the haunted house together 🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂
Man City will lose to other clubs. I'm sure of it. They could even lose at Bournemouth next!! They just love to win against Arsenal.
Nice to have aftv back 😂
Lee being honest and sensible along with being realistic, Julian watch this video and learn something from lee.
How do you lose everything you've worked for all season in just 3 consecutive games? How do you drop 8 points in 3 games? Now Arsenal have to start all over again and be near perfect like they've been before these past 3 games. Otherwise, they'll end up fighting for the 4th spot instead of the title.
Arsenal are back 🤣😭🤣😭🤣
Arteta out?
It's not looking good bruv !!
I advice all arsenal fans in England to start boycotting the stadium. Arsenal need to be sold to a new owners. Arsenal are the only team who never pay 90-100-120 million for players. With this mentality will never win any trophies. Kronke must leave our team… since 2006 when arsenal have been sold to kronke’s family till now we are suffering. Man city are not richer club than arsenal, man city can not even fill their stadium in a pl game. I advice arsenal fans to start protesting against the board who will never pay a huge amount for players. Why can not pay 100 million for grealish? Why couldn’t pay 90 millions for mudryk? Why couldn’t pay 120 for Enzo Fernandez?  Are we poor and we don’t know ? Conclusion: while kronke is the owner forget something called trophies.
The players are jaded? You’ve basically been playing in 1 competition since football restarted after the World Cup, United have been playing Premier League, League Cup and FA Cup.
Trossard and white should've started, nketiah is worse player in the league, I'd rather have chamakh
YO didn't Lee say City are scared of Arsenal?!!
Lee’s confused, Man U play Europa now, we skip this round. We have got more than a week until Europa League games comeback.
With all that gloating ... Good to see the dust and cloud has cleared
Saka is terrible, drop him now 😡
Arsenal fan here, I understand disappointment but we over over achieving doing well. I want top 4 which generates new players and new money. Let’s get top 4 anything above that is a bloody bonus especially with the last 12 seasons.
Same old Assssssssssinal 😂
If arsenal seem jaded then imagine have the Man United current run of games.
Gunners till I die
Aftv down to earth again...huhu
Keep buying Chelsea rejects🤣🤣🤣 and we got a penalty that never was, keep relying on a championship level striker, and a defensive midfielder who is made of glass,  why not play kiwior in midfield instead of the Chelsea reject
Lee alway's gives an honest assesment
lee J seriously the biggest arsenal expert
Let the Arsenal bottle job commence
There is a lot of football to be played guys relax we will win.
Very good technical point about Martinelli, missed by all pundits. Hope Arteta listens to Lee!
Need to beat villa
Ah aftv and chill how have I missed you 🤣🤣🤣
🎵Your defense is in trouble Gabriel in the room 🙂👈
I have been saying for months that Man City will over power every team in the PL and win the PL by end of March !! Congrats to Man City cos they are the best team on the planet by far !
I was so sure City will get red but our players inexperience cost them. Walker would have got red easily.. I miss Jesus here. Lacazette in his last season in games like this will get u easy penalties too. We need to get a coach to teach the boys all these antics.
Arsenal gifted City the 3 points tonight and that’ll be a tough pill to swallow…
Lee is smart honest and he sees it how it is not like most fans with there rose colored glasses
This is officially not enjoyable anymore
Assna are back 😂😂
Shameless FC we back baby
I this side of AFTV, I've missed this 🤣🤣🤣
i miss Arsenal fans worring that much i need this
😂😂😂😂🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡
They bring in Foden, we bring in Viera🤣
WE GOT OUR ASSNA BACK 🤣🤣🤣🤣
We were kinda naive playing out the back in the final 20 mins and paid the price. But there are many positives to take. Arsenal for me has still overachieved this season. Target was top 4 and anything else is a bonus. I don't think Nketiah is currently at the level to feature in a game like this as a starter. We definitely needed a striker and the chances he got today should have hit the target to say the least.   Gotta stay positive and ride this out. I love all the players and the effort that they have taken up to this point is immense from where we were last season. Xhaka and Jorgi were excellent. Battling City is like battling two first teams.
Forgot about the title, playing like this, top 4 could be in doubt🫣
Emery gonna park the bus
As long as Tottenham stay below us in the table I'm happy with that
Big up half face in the far left hand corner lool ;)
😂😂😂😂😂
Villa won't be easy AWAY for Arsenal. Its going to be another loss I'm afraid.
What a joke! One thing you cannot do is make mistakes, and the other is hit the target and this Arsenal side cannot do either in a big game like this! Gutted but deserved loss!
Already lost the title after the january transfer window, man city have good backup for players out of form, who is our backup for underperforming Odegaard, who is our backup for Saka, who is the backup for Xhaka... and we have europa coming up, more fixtures, lets face it, we did not do our best to strengthen in January and we have to fave the consequences
Far from over lads. It was never going to be simple trying to take a title from city. We beat leicester twice and they still went on to win the league. Im not sure we will win the league but i am sure you cant say city will definetly win it ...long way to go yet...all we need is one game to kick on
Seems like man City have got away with the 100 supposed charges against them
If arsenal can not beat a very weak Manchester city squad. We can never win the league, no energy in arsenal squad and arteta really need to change his pattern of playing
Outplaying  ManCity is not for everyone 😂
He's  done it again
January Champions FC
I've been saying all season we would probably end up in a top 4 race. Mainly cause injuries . Especially when it happened with Jesus. We don't have enough midfielders.  Just buying jorginiho wasn't ever going to be enough. El neny injured all season too. Our players are so so tired. Xhaka went up a level but he's still limited. And playing every game and cause of his pace . He looks even more tired. This is on edu. We didn't buy anyone really last Christmas. Really only trossard and jorginiho for more first team stuff this Christmas.   Jesus and zinny in summer. But really .  That was never enough. But with champions league money and football. Next summer w3 could get a few  more signings. Better players and then our squad might be better. Gunners that saw our transfer window and squad depth were so silly for saying we were going to win league but it was mainly rivals. Putting it on us. We have over achieved.  So we can be proud. Finish second and that will be amazing. 5th to second with only a few first team signings is a huge improvement.
Come on! Should have seen this coming ! They have Haaland--we have Nketiah! He just isn't the man! Wake up to reality!!
I think Lee is just frustrated- Arteta did change it somewhat and it failed
Your best player was the corrupt referee
Lee said nah nah Gabriel dead food tammy dead food 😄😄😄😄😄😄
There’s nothing to be worried about. Worry implies there’s a chance to win the league. There isn’t. We will finish 4th so there’s nothing to worry about.
The worrying part is this aint the tough times. Its a thursday sunday wednesday time will be tough. As much as youwant to be positive. Its tough to take when your that in front half way through the season. Next game will show is arsenal can get past this. If not i do believe its a city prem win
OLD ARSENAL ARE BACK. NICE. 🤣
Lee is the only Guy on AFTV that is using his brain he said after the Everton game that things could go down hill. They all said he was daft Well he's proven correct again
Am worried about dropping to 3rd place coz Man utd are in great form
I'm sick of hearing that we have a game in hand now do you seriously reakon we will win on Saturday at 12.30pm after tonight's defeat
Jordan went to the game, the proof is here😂
Bottle jobs..
Ha ha ha ha ha, Lee, the gift that keeps on giving
Trassa one side martinile up front sacka one side drop enkatea
Man Utd lives in their heads rent free🤣🤣
EDDIE SUPPOSED TO BE OUR SAVIOR? No goals or assists how much games now? But yet I’m hearing he’s in form? 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣, this has to be a cricket club, we win Against villa and it’s foolish talk again? Poor Arsenal fans, and we think we’re a big club?
BANTER FC😂😂😂
Their going to destroy Eddie playing him starting 11 when HE IS NOT READY! Whys this board so hard headed.. WE NEED a better forward while Jesus is out... but no. rely on a young spark against the best team in Europe. I'm done...
I can finally watch aftv again.
The problem is we don't have another striker who can come in instead of Nketiah....
Lee speaking truth....it's not just about the loss it's the fact we have 11 players and we are squeezing them. Lee is right we were complacent in January and prideful....we don't have a squad
The elephant has fallen from the tree
I'm worried arsenal may not even be in the top 2
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Arsenal wouldn't finish top 4 believe me
Gabriel needs to be rested
let em slide, cry more!!
Congratulations arsenal you won half a league..all this mob giving it the biggun when you were on form and on top what they forgot was the league's 38 games long
Martinelli needs the bench for a few games. Trossard to start.
Eeeeehhhheeee hhheeeer he he he hhhaaaa Ha ha ha ha DREAMERS
When would yiu ever think we would be in this position, think of last season
Wheels are falling off but fair play done well if you finish second.
Need to stay positive and carry on supporting our guys on the pitch
should be worried, city aint playing around now.
Not buying Caceido as a backup cost us the game today, Joginho played okay, but he is not the kind of player Arsenal needs. The is a complete drop-off. Not just a new forward and a DM is the problem. The difference in midfield with Thomas and without him is huge. We have not won any games joginho has played. If he plays on Saturday, we probably draw or lose. He is too small, too slow and his positional awareness is a problem. Chelsea never played his as a lone DM, all the games they did they lost. The broad not getting the players the manager wanted and buying alternatives is showing up in different ways. Same thing happened last year.
We are back to the good old Arsenal days 😅😅😅
Arsenal were better the first half; in the season half when Pep changed to the standard back 4 the match shifted as Arsenal lost thier easy options out wide  So they struggled to play out which ended up resulting in City scoring twice from winning the ball of Arsenals defence.
The problem for Arsenal is that City has the potential to go on a 12-13 game winning run and I just can’t see arsenal being able to keep up
Maddest thing is we've fucked over FA and Carling for what? Oh yeah potentially top 4, if we lucky. 🤣🤣😭😭😭
Lee says you know an 'like' more than I breathe air
I am here for Lee Let’s trust the process
I honestly agree with Lee. The team looked jaded
We can still finish top 4
Lee Judges: not sponsored by Head & Shoulders
If Arsenal don’t win the league this year, they’ll never win the league. Arteta is an average manager, no plan B and very reactionary. There’s a reason he hadn’t finished top 4 yet in the last 3/4 years
Welcome back none Arsenal fans.
Complaining about defense after hyping up Saliba, Zinchenko, and Gabriel as the best in the league☠️Ladies and Gentlemen I present you the Ultimate Premier League Banter Club🤣🤣👏👏
Gutted I think the last 2 games have put a massive dent in our title hopes
City have conceded like 23 goals in 23 games, they only conceded 26 last season, they aren't that good at the back. Terrible performance.
That second half was shocking – first half was decent and we should’ve gone in ahead really – and we gave the ball away high up the pitch for all their goals and they punished us and were clinical – they deserved the win.   Xhaka, who has been one of our best players this season so far, in that second half was absolutely shocking (it was so bad that it probs made this game his worst game in an Arsenal shirt even though his first half was decent)– Jorginho was legit our best player today lol he was the only Arsenal player who had a decent game.  But yeah now we have to move on I guess and go onto the next game
The Villa game is a must win, but if Arsenal can win that game, they are still in the driver's seat.
DOBBY is fuming 😂
Cocky arsenal fans finally put to shame 😂😂😂😂
The collapse is more disappointing than the result tonight, 3 games no wins, threw away a lead in a matter of weeks, that's the real disappointment, win nothing with that. Gabriel has this stupidity in his game. I said only way to guarantee winning the league every game was a must win, we haven't won any of them. Man u are 5 points behind, I fear where we end up and we won't beat Villa, players heads seem to be dropping and too many not playing.
Excellent point about Gabriels forward passing
hahaha losers
I remember when Nketia was scoring Cecil and Robbie were saying were not missing Jesus...and he will have to fight his way back in the team😆
Arsenal were not the better team for any of that game,apart from the penalty they didn't manage one shot on target. One goal from open play in the last 3 games tells its own story.
I agree we gotto mix it up even I could see that Martinelli not getting the service.  But we will fight to the end
big lee
City have an elite winning mentality. I don’t see them throwing it away. It’s city’s to lose as far as I’m concerned. You’ll lose your next match against Villa and Emery. City will go on that winning run that they tend to in the early part of spring, the business end of the season. Arsenal have bottled it big time. 9 point lead at one stage as well. 👍🏼
1 shot on target at home… and that was a pen. No wonder youve got 0 wins 0 draws 11 losses vs us in the league the last 5 years and we werent even good today
Very worried, this team is struggling big time right now. We just can't seem to score goals from open play, nothing is working atm. For the first time this season i'm not confident going away to Villa and Leicester in the next two games. We have a terrible mental block when it comes to crunch time. I'm hoping for top 4, title is out of the question as far as i'm concerned.
Didn’t think we’d get throwback AFTV this season.
Rant rant rant BWUAHAHAHAHAHA 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡 ...... Banter FC forevah 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡
Our players were a bag of nerves. Arteta  let the team down again with his team selection . Tierney should have started  we need width on the left side
Robbie Will officially become a billionaire when arsenal bottle the league
lee is right pep school arteta today
The real arsenal are back
Gonna support these lot no matter what! They made me all us fans feel a certain way, a way we haven’t felt in ages! We need to keep our spirits high, I know this squad can achieve a lot of great things in the years to come.
Martineli cant even complete passes leave alone dribling wtf happeped to him recently
This is why we needed to bring in a game changer in January, instead we had a 5/10 window.
Why isn't anybody saying about the passing from the back from Ramsdale Ramsdale was shocking today
Game was a joke, refs clearly wanted gunners to win
Where is Ty?
Bottle jobs 8 point lead 2 weeks ago + a game in hand. 🤣 humbled 😅 Villa & Leicester both away next 🤪 can’t lie missed Banter FC 😁
What are you panicking about ? We're still in the race and if you realize that City didn't beat us,  we beat ourselves with errors that shouldn't have been made, so we dust ourselves off and go again..
Oh how I have missed watching these 😌
Beautiful words Lee, cmon the Arse 💪👍
Finally aftv is normal again
“We were the better team “FC 😂
His worried the tosser hahahahahahahahahahaahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahhahahahahahaha CITY CITY CITY CITY 💙💙💙💙
AFTV welcome back....it has been boring for a long time. Time to start laughing 😃 again.
So, who’s ready to have the convo about Eddie Nketiah???
this is the same Lee that was 3 weeks ago saying after City knocked out Arsenal "City should be worried" ... well 3 defeats in 4 games and a return to last seasons form ..who's worried now ... Arteta once again showed his bad cards to the master (Pep) ... knock it off with this "Jaded" excuse ..
Lee is a loss away from Arteta out again.
Jesus is going to be 50/50 once he comes back smith Rowe is semi finshed …
Banter club 😂😂😂
Arsenal is becoming the definition of  you ain't doing alright if you ain't got haters from the way our rivals are coming out of the woodwork today inshaAllah our time is coming
The capitulation is in full effect. We will end up 3rd
Edu is a clown
Shocking performance the Arsenal of old ain't far away tbh
There's not a chance in hell Jesus is in Arsenal's top 2 players. Not even close.
Hahaha funny seeing these lot go back to their usual selfs.
​WE ARE TOP THE LEGUE WE ARE TOP THE LEGUE 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
When arsenal plays city arsenal lose 😂😂😂
The worrying part is not the zero win in 3 matches but the performance we put in those matches. Some of the individuals looked dreadful. Too many silly unnecessary mistakes made and we were punished. From now on, City are the favourite.
🍎 crumble FC 😂😂😂
It happens a  lot that Martinelli does not get the ball early enough
AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 SAME OLD ARSENAL ,DECEMBERS CHAMPIONS AND MAYS BOTTLERS 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
i can't see how we beat villa with eddie upfront the guy has no link play no hold up play needs 3 to 4 chances to score a goal
Bottling the league against a btec man city team. Get back in your box
Is that Hugh in the background??! 🤣
‘We’re gonna win cause City won’t play like Brentford’
Back to the good days 🍿
He's back. Voldemort's back.
Should have done better in the January transfer.
arteta out if he dont win league. too young.
We still have one game in hand
Jokes aside, Lee was spot on after the Manchester united match. Arsenal were lucky to get 3 points and it gave the deluded fanbase false hope
as lisa maffia once said: "it's all ova"
LMAOOOOOOOOO THEIR FANS ACC THOUGHT THEY'D WIN THE LEAGUE  THIS YEARS BOLTTINGGG FEELS BETTER THAN EVER 🤣😭😭 WE HAVE THE ARSENAL WE KNOW AND LOVE BACK
Artea out !
The final boss in Hogwarts Legacy
Humbled
As a city fan I just admit I was happy when Martinelli came off
Finally AFTV and chill is back 🤣.Only Arsenal can bottle an 8 point lead in 2 weeks with 2 games in hand
This is why Robbie wants city relegated 😂😂😂 knows on the pitch they are miles ahead of arsenal. If u cant beat them kick them out the league 😂😂
The last 10 games of the season are gonna be more hard. Man City has got the experience and we needed the 8 or 9 points difference to win it... I do now see us winning 12 out of the last 16 games when we have to play at Anfield and Etihad...
AFTV is back!!
AFTV is back baby, Bottle FC 😂😂
Another Realist
Lee: I’m worried  Rival fans: Evil Laugh
Why we never ever play back Saka on the left to surprise our opponents, having him on the left create more chaos for defenders…The wingers just never seem to swap during games.
Gabriel tonight was poor !
United will finish above you mugs 😂
I don’t like seeing Lee upset.
I am very worried negl.  Arsenal over previous years have given me PTSD. If we lose the next two games we could end up in a top 4 race 🤐
The funny thing is everyone could see arsenal crumbling but not the arsenal fans😂😂😂😂
Attitude had changed a lot in a week wowza
It’s not looking too good if Lee is worried
Your defence in trouble, Nketiah in the room 🤣
