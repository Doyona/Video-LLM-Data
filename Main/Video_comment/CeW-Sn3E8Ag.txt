Weak ass version of chicken head.
Excellent!
This is where she stole that dance from. Duke Deuce got way too many moves and he dance better than her.
immaculate vibes
Good To See Duke Still Going 🫡 & Glorilla on It🏌🏾‍♂️
Sooo we bringing back the 54.11's? Okkkk
That’s the chicken head background word to pattaaa
What???!!!!’ 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
These two need to become a duo !!!
At least duke saved the song
This the 22-23 Anthom!!
Stop copping bizmark
This literally one of my fave songs of all time 😂
The ratchet meet up looked fun this week
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
JUST SAY THAT 😂
The Best Part of this song 0:55
Crunk sta Duce and Glo, Duce keep em’ coming!!
You can definitely hear the Project Pat influence. Great Record 👍🏾
He has a project pat flow
This got 3 6 Mafia and Project Pat written all over it! But it's still my jam tho.
Not gone lie. I was a gorilla hater. Naa she dope. Love this type shit
My man rocking the high top reeboks
That piano👌🏾
the way she say on gang...it'll catch Big Glo... you better start reading contracts and trademarking shti...caked up as makeup
🗑
You don’t really want no smoke you coke head just say that😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
I love her💕
“I got GG on Louis V ion care if that shit go”  Straight up bro 😂
Love her 😍😍
"Chickhead pt. 2" I love it! This brings back memories 🤣🤣🤣
Eeeyyye doe
that piano wasnt made by a beat machine those are real piano keys being played props to the person that made this instrumental
This video would've been huge on 106&Park. National rotation everyday for months..
This shit hard. I hope Glorilla throw Duke a big look in the future. She going mainstream on his sauce a lil bit.
Do I see a Reebok endorsement 👀👀
melody is hard asf. Beethoven must've made it.
Aye I fucks wit dis 🤣🤣🤣 y’all niggas did dat 💯
This gives me chicken head vibes..... I love it
ooooh oohhhhhh remind me of the 3 6 days
Kuz got the Fubu Jersey on. Let's go!!!!!!!!
🗑️🚮
But they cancel Andrew tate for supporting male mental health..
Why they trying to steal chicken head vibes LOL this generation can't be original.
MEMPHIS RAP IS ON THE MAP RIGHT NOW
Hold up I just realized dude had a 05 fubu throw back on 😂😂😂
“Ole caked ass make up , Ian trynna fuck dat ho “! 😂😂👏🏽
BIZ MARKIE WOULD BE PROUD!!
I love how she's tight with her friends. On all her videos it look like the same girls, but they really love her!!! Those Memphis girls will pull your weave loose about her!!!
What the fuckkkkkkk!!!!!
@2:45 DuKe DueCe snapped
This is reminiscent of Project Pat and LA Chant
Stop dancing please
Did shit 🔥
They rap about the same shit.  Gorilla or whoever she is isn't anything special.   They all have limited vocabulary and talk about the same shit in every song.  This new generation has low expectations of artist.
Low I.Q. vibes...💤 I'll passs
this is gold, its the classic fubu for me real south shit right here
We know the whole song 🔥🔥🔥 just say that
I’m really liking this beat.
Good song
Do this nigga got a fubu jersey on?
That beat is insane!!
Get it glo, I’m cheering for you!!!!❤
3 6 mafia kids right here 😈💕
Fubu or no?
This is a classic. A hit. 9M views isn’t enough and I’m a whole New Yorker lol this reminds me of when Project Pat hit up north in the late 90’s early 00’s real Memphis vibe. Y’all sleep B!
New chicken head song guess yall ain't see that
Glo gangsta boo and LA chat
This the new age project pat and 3 6 mafia fucks with this 💯
This video and song so fire
Imma need one with her and Suki. I saw Suki wit the blond wig on. I think that would be the biggest song of both of their careers.
Glo might be the one to bring back natural bodies
I love this shit........on da real.......
Love This.....Junt Hard  〽️901
Why does this song not have more views than this lol
I hope they never fix his Time Machine
Getting 3 6 vibes
I can’t say I’m broke
Feel like Memphis 1997
Nobody   Glorila.  0__________0
I’m damn near 40, and Ima be bangin’ that song til I’m 80.  That sh!t hard af
“Tryna buk cause I didn’t pay.. if you broke just say that”.. every broke bitch in the world that feels entitled to niggas money felt that one.
#MaaaaN_I_Love_That_Bitch_JST
#GotGlo_JST ❤

This is Heat! All Independent Artists and Producers tap in with me lets network 🙏
Memphis only has about 220 thousand ppl n the whole area or county 400-600 thousand ppl so it must have about the greatest quality of Rappers n Musicians outside of ATL n now when I think about the greatest quality overall period as far as music cause there's project Pat Juicy J Elvis BB King rip Triple 6 Skinny Pimp Duke Duce Pooh Shiesty Dolph Big Scarr AP, Zed Zilla Yo Gotti, Money Bag Yo, Block boy jb Black Youngsta, n many more
Memphis doing this shit right 💯

🚫I 🌏smoke💸 weed🧟 why📆
A lot of artists from other cities were influenced by the sound from round here, bit off a chunk and put their own spin to it. If it wasn't the dark cloud over this city that kept all this talent from uniting like artist from other cities, Memphis area would've dominated rap. 3-6 with Pat, J and Gotti would've owned the industry
She's 🔥 very talented and chill this shit look easy
🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
This song deserves more recognition!

TO THOSE WHO HAVE NOT YET PLACED YOUR FAITH IN CHRIST FOR SALVATION. RIGHT NOW YOU CAN STILL BE SPARED THE WRATH TO COME! 7 YEARS OF HORRIFIC JUDGMENT UPON THE EARTH FOR THE REJECTION OF GOD'S PROVISION FOR SALVATION, THROUGH FAITH IN CHRIST, IS ABOUT TO BEGIN! BIBLE PROHECY IS ACCURATE! ALL PROPHECIES HAVE ALREADY BEEN FULFILLED EXCEPT FOR THOSE THAT DEAL WITH THE VERY END OF THE END DAYS! THAT IS WHERE WE ARE AT RIGHT NOW! THE RAPTURE IS IMMINENT, AND ONCE THE LORD REMOVES HIS CHILDREN FROM THE EARTH THE FULFILLMENT OF REVELATION CHAPTERS 6-19 WILL BEGIN SHORTLY AFTER. THEY START ON THE DAY A COVENANT FROM DANIEL 9:27 IS SIGNED. THIS IS A 7 YR PEACE COVENANT BROKERED BY THE SO-CALLED "ANTICHRIST", ONE WHO WILL BE DEMONICALLY EMPOWERED, AND WHO OPENLY SERVES SATAN. THOSE WHO REJECT THE MARK HE WILL OFFER AND THEN MAKE MANDATORY WILL BE BEHEADED ACCORDING TO REVELATION 20:4. PLEASE DON'T WAIT TO PUT YOUR FAITH IN CHRIST. YOU CAN STILL BE SAVED AFTER THE RAPTURE BUT YOU WILL THEN BE LEFT BEHIND TO ENTER THE TRIBULATION AND WILL LOSE YOUR LIFE FOR WAITING TO TURN TO JESUS BECAUSE THE ANTICHRIST WILL MARTYR ALL WHO DO. PLEASE DON'T WAIT. TODAY IS THE DAY OF SALVATION. NONE OF US KNOWS IF WE HAVE TOMORROW!  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ugl2...

#GodHimself - #Yahweh manifested in the #Flesh as #DrHenryCliffordKinley Saturday, June 6, 1931. Just as He did 2,000 years ago as #YahshuaTheMessiah who the world calls #JesusChrist. But there wasn't a "J" in the #Hebrew #Greek & #Latin language and also wasn't in the #English language until some 1,400 years after the Messiah's death - making it originally the last letter of the alphabet. Which begs the question❓ what was the name of our Lord and Savior before His #Crucifixion #Ascension and #Pentecost (outpouring of the #HolySpirit). #Emmanuel which translates to #GodIsWithUs 🙏  - The #InstituteOfDivineMetaphysicalResearch - Dr. Henry Clifford Kinley, Founder and Dean 🙏🕊️🕊️🕊️🙏    https://youtu.be/npiDLh3kzF4

5 Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth; fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry: 6 for which things' sake the wrath of God cometh on the children of disobedience: 7 In the which ye also walked some time, when ye lived in them. 8 But now ye also put off all these; anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy communication out of your mouth. --HOLY BIBLE

Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life; whoever does not obey the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God remains on him.  John 3:36  For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.  Romans‬ ‭6‬:‭23 Jesus Christ is the only way, seek Him while He may be found, before it’s too late, tomorrow is never promised..

Glorilla and Duke have such complimentary flows and deliveries. They are both great in their own ways too but hearing them work together is always a treat. I think the fanbases are generally really similar too which is nice to see likeminded people collide every time they collab. I hope someday I can gather even a tenth of the amount of fans with the perspectives that theses two fan bases have for my own music. Truly unmatched energy🔥
The whole video was lit 🔥🔥
🔥🔥this reminds of the project pat chicken head video
