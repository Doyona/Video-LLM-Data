Welcome to the championship 😆😆😆😆😆
3:16 What a Mong!
aaaaaaand they're back
Leeds are so crap😂😂
Leeds united look like they could get promotion or win the league
thank you for the information
which season did this relegation happen for Leeds United football club
Tottenham, on behalf of every Manchester United fan all over the world, thank you.
Wont find another Lucas Moura again, most under rated player of all time
Just came back 1 season later to have a double laugh at Leeds after they bottled promotion😂
That Harry Kane assist to pedro porro was amazing. The skill, then the amazing pass.
Leeds, Leeds are falling apart again!
ngl why cant he do that in the world cup or euros?!
Leeds are so bad 😢
Kane 1-0  0:03 Porro 2-0  0:53 Kane 3-1  2:10 Moura 4-1  2:40
Haaaaaaa
Nobody talks about Moura’s goal barely enough, amazing solo goal and should’ve been goal of the month
Come back up next season, best of luck, from an Everton supporter
bye leeds scum
This day was the best day in football history
na..na…na.na..na ey ey ey GOODBYE✌️✌️✌️

Kane the actual biggest monster in a good way what a legend what a hero we'll miss him when he retires😥
Leeds mot, hahahahaha
1:05
Delicious
Marching on into the lower league together,
if Kane hadn’t Been at Tottenham this season Spurs would be 17th💀
personally I think the biggest mistake was Buying younger players , by this I mean ok buy some BUT IT SEEMED TO ME PRIORITY WAS YOUTH , AT EXSPENSE OF 1ST TEAM . its no wonder then that young players 4 to 1 rasio in well they were going to better them sell them and then THEY COME BACK AND BEAT US . IF RASIO WAS OTHER WAY ROUND WE WOULD NOT ONLY HAVE BEEN IN P.D. NOW BUT HALF WAY UP . BUT NO UNDERMINE THE CLUB YOU OWN MANAGE ETC THATS WHY WE WENT DOWN. AND I AM NOT SAD ABOUT IT  EITHER . PLAYERS OUT ALL BUT 3 GNONTO SINISTERRA AND SUMMERVILLE  . NOW BRING BACK MOORE DRAMEH THOSE 2 AT MILLWALL , TWO AT MIDDLESBRO BORN IN LEEDS MGR LEE BOWYER , WHY  ENGLAND 1966 TEAM HAD 4 VERY GOOD PLAYERS OTHERS WERE NOT AS GOOD BUT WIN IT THEY DID. WELL LEEDS PASSION FOR HOME CLUB IS WORTH THAT and if for one season maybe 2 JAMES MILNER as a sweeper due to age .
Burnt my shirt in garden moment I got home.
Goodbye Leeds you won’t be missed 😂
That guy at the end bro 😅
😂😂😂😂😂
Good Riddance!
Only team whose fans regularly booed players taking the knee at home matches.  Karma 🤷
Leeds relegated 👍👍👍
i just bought a 4k tv to watch the next season premiership - but it doesn't come with any leeds LMAO
Moura to villa
Cheer up, its only a silly game with a ball...
Au revoir Leeds 👋
Chin up Leeds Utd - You'll be back - Keep the faith... Mind you that Harry Kane was rather good
😂😂😂😂😂😂
leeds back where they belong, anywhere but in the premier league
Anyone that says harry is crap has no idea about football
Mind the gap Leeds. From everyone at Brentford FC.
Moura signed off in style! What a goal!
Sad to see moura go tbh. Don't think he always got the playing time he deserved but when he played, he always showed up. If we lose Kane, we are stuffed.
Good way for Kane to say goodbye
Sorry Leeds but I mean , come on..!
I can’t remember the last time we had six defenders in the starting eleven, a great tactical move that. We need to win and we play a system I have never seen before. Anyway on the bright side at least I won’t suffer from depression almost every weekend next season! Well I hope so ??? MOT
Not even his own fans would blame him if he went to old Trafford
Kane has to go to Man U he has to
leeds are going down going down leeds are going dooown
Poor leeds
LEEDS ARE FALLING APART AGAIN
Best place for Leeds utd, violent fans
Another 17years away from premier league for Leeds
Bye bye 👋🏻 😂
I don't think we can expect any less delusional comments from Leeds fans next season about a club who were half decent about 60 years ago and havent won owt in a lot of people's lifetime
What a season England all time top scorer spurs all time top scorer 30 goals in a awful team him not having a trophy is a travesty
That moura goal was lovely
Good riddance
Leeds deserved this
30 goals for Tottenham.. Imagine Harry Kane in Man City 🤯  Haaland has nothing on him yet
Lucas and that goal
lol
Leeds would of been relegated anyway even if they won, so calm down.
Sam is definitely on the same wave length as klopp and guardiola
Big Sam’s ‘nobody is better than me’ stuff looks a bit silly now. 😂
I was a manc who was brought up in Leeds. So enjoy Leeds fans. Championship team. Great stuff.
Lol goodbye Leeds hahahaha
Big Sam didn't save Leeds 😂😂😂
We all love spurs
And we just let Lucas go. Ridiculous decision
👋👋👋💀💀
what Moura did was unreal
I’ve just bought a 75 inch TV to watch the Premier League next season.  I’ve opened up the box and there’s no Leeds.  🤣🤣😂😂
Someone needs to snatch up Jack Harrison, consistent baller
SWFC fan here: See you next season!😊
Pascal striujk..enough said
30 goals in this spurs side is more impressive than Haalands goal tally. (Not a Spurs fan)
Bathing in the tears of leeds fans.
Imagine getting relegated by Tottenham
Kane getting 30 in that spurs side is far more impressive than haaland getting 36 for that city side. I think Kane would get more than 36 if he had de bruyne assisting him.
Absolutely gutted for the Leeds fans
Should of stuck with Bielsa.
Leeds definitely earning their place on the championship looking forward to our matches
Like ayling wouldn't even get in my Sunday team 😂 yet he's leeds captain 👋
Nice to see Leeds back down where they belong, league positions don’t lie.
We should put ayling up front lol
😂😂😂
Lucas Moura got totally hosed by Tottenham. So unjust. He’s probably a way more efficient striker in terms of goals or assists per minute played compared to Son or Kane but of course because he’s a devout Christian and Levy is a Jew, he’s been sidelined for non footballing reasons. And no, it’s not always the injury. That’s just the excuse they feed to the media.
30 goals for spurs, he needs to hurry up and leave before it’s too late
Am I the only one who sometimes thinks soccer is onotypical?
Premier League: Earn it.
Respect to many Leeds fans who applauded  when Lucas scored his goal. Thanks for the memories Lucas you will always be in spurs hearts.
Kane looks depressed
Ahahahahahaha good you cheats back to where you should’ve never left 🐏. Party time 🥳 🕺
Marco Bielsa  > Leeds entire squad.
Whoever reads this u must reply
Pep and klopp have nothing on big Sam. Nothing.
Leeds Leeds falling apart again!!! Dirty Scummy Leeds. Welcome back to Championship!!!
Hahahah bye bye Leeds ❤️💛🐓🐓🐓🐓
Scummy scummy leeds
Pedro Porro 🔥
Imagine Kane with this goals in united 😂
Harry Kane is a prolific striker, but he has no football sense of Halland. Argue with your keypads
If you cant even beat Us you deserve to go down
Everyone has been talking about Haaland this season but I'd argue that 30 goals in this Spurs team is even more impressive
Only One person  is Fault to regelation. Fake smiles Chairman Andrea Radrizzani. If still in charge next season we have no chance to promote. He is the one employed the managers . He deserved what he got , l am glad losing millions pounds .
At least we gave the premier league some of the worst defending the English top flight has ever seen as a leaving present.
Leeds look like they play 7 upfront and 3 at the back? They just cannot defend. That is there downfall.
Leeds back in their rightful place. Without stating the obvious they just can't cut it in the big league. Man utds  rivals, laughable.
That's really classy from Pedro Porro.
WE HATE DIRTY LEEDS!!!!!
Absolutely shocking defending again, leaking like a sieve at the back and wasteful up front. Just not good enough.
Harry Kanes celebration is so bad 😂
Sky sports you don’t need to rub it in with the down pointing arrow emoji in the title 😂
Kane > Haaland
Harry Kane just thinks about his own awards and goals 😂
Terrible season for both clubs. I actually thought Conte and Spurs would get top 4 at the start of the season but that run of 10 wins in their last 14 games last season to clutch 4th was just a false hope for them. Other than that since making the 2019 UCL final theyve really been struggling to make 60 points each season and languish around 8th. They need a massive, massive sort out. Kane getting 30 goals is amazing, if not for Haaland this would be spoken about way more. Kanes done all the personal records at Spurs, top club and national goalscorer, this was his best league scoring campaign. He's got so many appearances for Spurs but he relaly should be pushing to move on, and tbh it'd be best for Spurs to have that overhaul and not be so reliant on him. Cash in on Kane, maybe Son too and sort themselves out next season ready for 2024 I'd say.  Didnt predict Leeds to go down but not surprised really. At times their game management was laughable this season. They've been a fun watch though in their time in the EPL as a neutral.
I hope they spent 16 years or more in the championship 😂😂
Leeds absolutely deserve to go down, they've spineless this season. Big Sam didn't help that at all. That Leeds defence just gave up with the Moura goal.
Kane would have scored more goals then the Viking if he had gone to Man City
Gutless spineless cowards. Get rid of the lot of em.
Good bye Leeds hope you don’t come back 🎉
That Leeds manager seems a promising young lad. Spurs should give him a go next season.
Should have kept dan james 😏
a Spurs team which has been poor all season have thrashed a Championship side who have had defenders who can't defend and strikers who have been incapable of scoring goals all season. what happened to the team who beat Chelsea 3-0 and beat Liverpool at Anfield? oh ALAW for the Championship
Why was Gnonto on the bench?
Two clubs, stuck in the past, go head-to-head.
Truth of the matter, Leeds are out of their depth in the PL..What do they do on the Training Ground?..They cant defend.Ayling and company charging up  and down that pitch for 90 minutes like luneratics., they're  knackered🤣..Cannot concede over 80 goals, and expect to survive.I hope a PL club come in for Jack Harrison, quality player..
not good enough. get down
Some of the worst defending this season I have ever seen from a club
FINALLY Spurs win!!!
Always show emotions at the end, but what about the rest of the season.
LUFC It's a  joke .not deserve to play in PL
I just don't understand how we keep fringe players like Dier, Sanchez and Richarlison but yet don't renew Lucas Moura's contract???. I'd have him playing every game. He's a good playmaker.
Leeds.....your garbage, not good enough for the prem. Terrible managment
The leeds fans bashing united all hear leaving the premier league ahhhh thats delicious
As a Man U fan I couldn’t be happier we get 3rd and the Leeds 🤬 go bck to where they belong 😂😂😂
That guy at 3.17 when your amazon parcel doesn't arrive
Seen better defending in the local Sunday league
Back to watch these highlights again hahaha bye Leeds
Wtf was that defending for the Lucas moura goal 🤣
wow  leeds     are   ok    have a  good season  after this   some season  in the chaponship     lutton in   the prem     what a  season   a greAT ENGLISH FOOTBALL
😂😂😂😂 🎉🎊🎉🎊🎉
Man U should stop thinking about it and get Kane. That would no doubt make them Champions. On the other hand i hope they don't
2004: Leeds relegated after losing 4-1 & finishing 19th in the table. It took them 16 years to get back to the top flight & they even got relegated to League One during those 16 years.  2023: Leeds relegated after losing 4-1 & finishing 19th in the table. Um…
The defending from Leeds man woeful
Kane should have gone 2 seasons ago. Levy owes that guy the biggest leaving bonus in history.
So happy to see Leeds go down
How can you be angry about going down when you provide a 4th goal like that lmao
The Leeds legends don’t seem to have worked do they.  No one likes Leeds, horrible club and horrible people.
Spurs looked good in this game, shame they didn't get Europe but Spurs are back where they belong, mediocrity COYG
We all hate Leeds
leeds were great today and were unlucky to not snatch a draw, are defence is non existent,are attack is good ,but big sam will have to do a lot next season to get us back up to the prem and gnonto is a shocking and disgusting player get him out of are club that italien stalien.
So glad Leeds have gone down!! 😀
Leeds is one of those *"big city - small club"* phenomena. Contrast that with the various fortunes of Brighton, Brentford and Bournemouth.
The TV coverage showed a number of "fair weather" Leeds supporters leaving before the end.  Now is the time your club needs your support. Stay to the end.
If you concede too many goals and don't score enough at the other end you get relegated, simple!
I think I speak for the majority of the country when I say ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
Another shocking performance sealed within 2 minutes of the start of play in both halves. That’s not just lack of focus it’s lack of mental preparation.  the players responsible for the former the manager the latter, that’s what you get with a journeyman. The defence for number four would have embarrassed a Sunday league team
Everton 1-0 Bournemouth Leeds relegated Aston Villa 2-1 Brighton Tottenham dont make Europe 🇪🇺
The shame is , it’s the fact that the 2 relegated teams who went down on final day were at home so the fans could experience it ALL.
2:07 crap defending from ayling. been poor all season no idea why he's ur captain. he's creap
The championship is going to be exciting next season 👍
Sam Allardyce got £500,000 for the last 4 matches with Leeds. He was on for £2.5m if he kept Leeds up. Might have to be Dorset rather than Dubai from here on out Big Sam.
If Harry Kane left Spurs he would’ve have a much better career in terms of trophies. He has to leave the club for his own good
About time they got sent back down.
Marching on together....into the Championship 😂😂😂
Maybe missing Bielsa spying on the opposition. Big Sam on the first plane out of the country now with his half a million. LOL.
What a waste of time and money allardyce was.
As a spurs fan I think most of us are sad about Lucas…. He gave us the best moment of this club in the past 10-20 years and he deserved better ❤️ we’ll miss him for sure
Leeds have great fans and a rubbish team
Lucas can't believe spurs are letting him go quality player just sums up the terrible situation there Levy out
HAHAHA remember when Leeds we’re gonna school Villa?
I thought Dyce was better then klopp and pep 😂😊
Bye bye dirty Leeds. Take your time coming back now!
For Kane to score 30 goals in that side is absolutely remarkable imagine if he played for City
Had no idea Kane was pushing 30 goals 😂
Unpopular opinion please don’t come for me but Arsenal should pay £100 million for Kane and I guarantee you we will win the league 😅😂
How do Spurs got a 30 goal a season striker all these years and still not win a thing😅
Sam Allardyce isnt getting that 2.5 mill anymore 😂
happy theyve gone down
down you go and your not coming back
Leeds got to far ahead of themselves 😢 bye bye we will miss you guys
Bye!😂😂😂😂😂
Harry Kane will be a Tottenham legend but I think he really could’ve done so much better if he joined Man U or something a few seasons back he could definitely be in the ballon d’Or conversation but think Tottenham and himself held him back from potentially being the best English player since shearer or maybe even better than shearer
Moura still lives in ajax head
spurs squad aint great however porro looks decent going forward
This Leeds side are not good enough to play in the pl. Being dismantled by a team like spurs just rubber-stamps that fact.
Bye bye dirty Leeds!
Leeds championship kit looks smart 🤓
Bye Leeds Bye Leicester and bye Southampton
Kane has had a better season than haaland PREM only
😂😂😂😂😂
Good, no one likes Leeds. Spurs finally show up to a game, and did Leeds gift Moura his goal as that was shocking defending
So glad Leeds are down 😊
That lucas goal though
👋 bye Leeds no one will miss you
GOOD RIDDANCE
Good riddance Leeds 😂😂😂😂
Big sam laughing all the way to the bank 👍
Hahaha cry Leeds fans was asking for championship playing bamford up front all season tbh
That Moura goal summed up Leeds and their lack of effort today. You can't let an opposing player run with the ball through your entire defence into the box and score from six yards without a challenge.
Bye bye Leeds get back to where you belong
Lucas moura is going to be missed legend of the club
The defending on that 4th goal just sums up Leeds' season. Every team has been able to walk through them with ease.
Leeds were relegated a long time before today. Their defence has been abysmal.
At this rate In 2 seasons time kane will have scored more prem goals than shearer he needs 51
Worst defending I’ve ever seen , no fight to get back and defend atall, committed all players forward but when lose the ball don’t run back? Get hit with counter attack every time , that 30th goal for Kane was the Easiest goal he’s scored in his career probably😂 no one running back to try and defend and put pressure on , deserve to go down 😂 bye Leeds 👍🏻
And that Harrison kids too good to go down
Marching down to the EFL together 😅😅😅
If you lose 4-1 to Tottenham can’t say you don’t deserve it!!!
Good riddence Leeds, hope you rot for 20+ years in the pepsi league hahahahahaha :P
Bye bye Leeds.
Couldn’t have happened to a worse club🤷🏽‍♂️
It's the history of the Tottenham
Spurs will be relegation candidates without Kane.
Alan Shearer should have moved club and won more trophies! Is Harry  not moving because he honestly thinks they can win cups or he loves being the big fish in a small pond at Spurs ?
cya
Haha bye Leeds
Feel bad for Leeds. A huge club that doesn’t belong in the Championship. Hope to see you back in the prem soon.  Happy for Lucas and Porro!
Pathetic defending from Leeds. Paid how much per week...yet the record breaking striker from spurs is given tons of space for both his goals. Easy tactics to sort...you deserve relegation
Very good Klich just laughs 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 with Bielsa
Cheap season ticket next season lads
Harry Kane seriously needs to leave spurs
Glad to see the back of Leeds. Crap team with even crappier fans.
Haaland only managed six more than Kane in a dream team!
They came here hoping, but they will spent the summer hurting 😳
😂 Bye leeds back to were you belong and take the best manager in the world with you 😅😅😅
Thats a vile spurs away kit , why the  florescent yellowcon the collar its horrible
Moura is always there when you need him scores unbelievable goals 👏🏾
Kane defo breaking alan shearer's record
Absolutely gutted leeds have gone down . Loved giving them a good hiding
Harry Kane is such a high quality player. Gotta wonder if there's more for him in his remaining career than what Spurs have to offer.
Can’t believe he has 30 prem goals that is madness
Porro is like David luiz, a defender who spends more time near the opponents penalty area than his own.
Some of the defending is almost non professional it’s that bad
Why couldn’t he of scored more like that instead of waiting till last game…..  never cud find end product most games if u ever noticed he was playing in first place
the npc commentator
I though big Sam was supposed to be better than sir Alex, Pep and Juergen? 😂😂😂
Well done Tottenham Hotspur Conte was really really right you fight for the 8 place 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Easy money for big Sam 😂
That Sam Alardyce fella is up there with the best. Klopp, Poch, Pep... and Sam
Now fo leeds scum
Kane’s style of play or perfectly suited to Man Utd. With the City move gone now it’s the only realistic option in the Premier League… Assuming he wants to break the Premier League goals record.
American Italian owners Marsh a premiership manasger we got screwed big time noe they want leeds council to foot bill for nrew stadium'??
See ya Leeds 😂
Took them nearly 2 decades to get back to the big time and decided to bin the man that got them there in favour of boring boring football
You know you're in trouble when Alladyce turns up to manage you.
what happened to lucas moura. he still dribbles like a beast
What a great atmosphere at the end of the match. Not only Leeds getting relegated, but spurs contemplating their season that saw them relegated from champions league status, straight past Europa, to mid table
The Premier League has never been won by an English Manager. Leicester, Leeds and Everton all managed by English managers. Says it all really 😂😂😂
Kane to united is the perfect transfer for all involved
Beautiful.❤
Leeds will trash that Championship competition
Thanks for everything lucas love yah from n17 and beyond  💔
the quality of football was much better 10 years ago
Goodbye lucas 😢
Please someone free Kane from this prison
Haha bye bye Leeds 🎉 filthy team
Nice for a good Brazilian footballer to score on his last game for his club today
As much as Haaland has stolen the limelight this season, Kane had to be the the standout imo. Didn't do his scoring in hattricks, just ruthless consistency.
The first  Tottenham goal tells the truth how bad team Leeds are. The players don't know were to go and almost crush each other! So poor team!
WWWWWHHHHHHHEEEEEEYYYYYYYYY
Leeds scum going down what a day
When you leave Harry Kane unmarked on the penalty spot after 2 mins........
When it comes to Leeds you would have thought in their last game at home they would have shown some guile but they looked completely out of their depth and moreover resigned to being relegated before the game started.
Story of Lucas’s life
Bye bye leeds see you in 20 years
Kane come to Chelsea, make us great again 💙
absolutely deserved relegation. cheerio
I am a Tottenham fan and I was hoping Lucas would win a trophy before he leaves.
😂 Leeds United
Lucas Maura goal was exactly like I use him on fifa
Kanes way too good for spurs 😂
Lucas Moura is a Tottenham legend
Sad to see us go down
30 goals won’t give him a trophy though 😂😂
Leeds never deserved to be in the Premier league, they are a second rate club, and always will be. If they deserved to stay they wouldn't have been in the bottom 3. The players didn't want it, neither did the new or old manager. Only the fans I feel sorry for
This game watch great for 2 reasons.1, Leeds got relegated, 2, Tottenham still missed out on European football.  Made my day.
Couldn't of happened to a nicer bunch 😀
Back to reality
Cheerio leeds😂😂😂😂
Leeds are really crap. At this rate they'll be in League One in no time at all.
Leeds down what a shame........not
We all love Leeds but not this side
What a moment for Lucas Moura 🤩
Spurs would be such a good club if they had a proper manager and a very good defence.
Moura always does stuff like this, and we're letting him go!? One of the only players who puts everything into the game.
Was this Kanes last game for Spurs 😮😮😮
Kane is just different class. Not a Man Utd fan but i'd like to see him in a top side like theirs, he'd be fantastic.
What on earth… Leeds fans must be livid. You’d never know Leeds were facing relegation today. Absolutely no fight, no will, no drive… there was nothing. When it mattered the absolute most… the players showed absolutely nothing. To look at those players, you’d think they all thought “it’s fine, all the Prem clubs will buy us in the summer, I’m losing nothing here”. Appalling from Leeds.
30 goals and not being the top goal scorer is insane
Man United fan here will miss the annual 6 points.!!!
Back down for you.
wow those leeds players didnt even put up a fight
See ya Leeds. Back to where you belong.
Pedro porro has been brilliant since he joined in January Kane needs to move in summer and Leeds deserve to go down
All I'm saying is Moura!!!⚽️ All the best kiddo enjoy your life.
We'll be back..MOT
I live in Bridlington on the Yorkshire Coast and with it being bank holiday weekend,  its full of leeds fans. Well since the end of the match, I've heard the sirens at least six times heading into town.l😂
Well,,it was always gonna happen,,last year it was pure luck we stayed,,this year,,pathetic,,nearly 80 goals let in ..the team isn’t hungry!!,,it’s sad that all the hard working fans to watch all the players just give up…and yes,,they aren’t worthy of wearing the shirts.. money,,that’s all it’s about,,no pride,,no desire,,no bloody hope..enjoy the pay cuts lads…😔😔
Good riddance Leeds 🎉
That forth goal is why Leeds were relegated, absolutely abysmal defending, that one defender just let him walk past and stood still in the box and watched him score...
moura finally decided to score a goal
Even as an Arsenal fan, you have to admire Kane as a goal scorer. Moura was wasted at Spurs.
Best thing spurs done all season, putting that final nail in Leeds coffin. Yes, they would've still gone down regardless if they won. Happy for Morua, was nice of Leeds to let him score.
Guess I'll have to wait longer for my liverpool/leeds half and half scarf now 😂 sorry Paul Kellet R.I.P brother YNWA MOT
LEEDS, LEEDS ARE FALLING APAAAART AGAIN
Bye bye Leeds nice knowing u
Well done big Sam, always knew you would do it....
So happy to see Leeds get relegated again. Deluded club with a deluded fan base of astronomical levels.
Sam Allardyce is just a waste of money for any side. He's a dinosaur
Bye Leeds see ye in 20 years …..Tim pot club 😊
I'm afraid Leeds would have gone down without Churchill dog Allardyce anyway but this showed how crap he is ! He put no motivation into that Leeds side & didn't pick the most offensive side from the start & the chances they missed still showed that the current squad are a Championship side & if no new quality players are purchased they will remain there until they do ! I just hope he didn't get any of the bonus banded about in the press for the failure !
Kane’s my POTS
Kane needs to go to a better  club he deserves it 💯
Finally Tottenham actually won. good luck to you in the championship, we’ll miss u in the premier league 😢
Great 4th goal for Spurs. As for Leeds, they are going to need to shake things up if they want to come back. That side will struggle in the Championship
😂😂
Made up Leeds are gone, only city where you get kicked off on constantly for having a different accent. Horrible, angry, aggressive people and I’m glad you’re gone.
Leeds went "down market " with Marsch & bought "young" . Been a season long train crash with the  outcome inevitable.
Lets be honest, no one will miss leeds with the worst fans and dirty players
As a Leeds fan I’m not going to be a Man City fan absolutely rubbish
Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
Leeds will be able to hold on to their entire squad because no one is stupid enough to buy any of this dross. Cheerio 👋
Horrible club, hope it’s another couple of decades before they come back up
Good riddance. Truly horrible fans.
Harry kane is worst striker to ever play top flight football all these goals no trophies make it make sense 😂
Jeez Kane for the sake of your career get a move sorted.
Harry Kane scoring 30 goals in a shockingly poor Spurs side is absolutely insane. If only he was at Man United
See you in 16 years leeds ,back.where you belong
3 seasons in the premiership....parhetic even the bigger club Burnley did six
Satisfying seeing us put Leeds down
oh these are highlights,.. see you next year UTT
Kane won’t stick around next season, this is his chance to push a move out of a banter club, no European competition next season and it’s completely understandable given that it’s Tottenham, if kane moves away, spurs will be fighting relegation next year!
Mourns goal was beautiful and fitting farewell for him I will never forget him against Ajax.   What I would say is the fact he could dance through a team and walk the ball into the net is probably why that same team is relegated. Leeds are no way good enough to be in the Prem.
What should’ve happened last season has now happened this season, amazing to see them go down :D
Spurs players celebrating like it actually means anything 😂
Such a shame...UTV 😂
Super Sam will save the day
Poor leeds🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Couldnt defend, couldnt score, recipe for disaster, didnt buy anyone decent at the back or front, got what they had coming to them
Always sad when a team like Leeds get relegated. Under normal circumstances I would have liked them to survive, but being a Toffee, obviously not today. I’m sure they will be contenders next season.
YOU WILL BE BACK LEEDS AND WE'LL BE WAITING FOR YOU!! TRUE PREM TEAM!!!!!!!!!!
That's what they get for firing Marcelo Bielsa
With that ball watching defence. Leeds are in big trouble in the championship.
What will TopSpur do without Kane?
Pathetic
Kane is unbelievable...30 goals in a poor Spurs season is nuts!
Harry Kane is really good. He deserves a cup. Even though I’m sad Leeds got relegated, I still respect him. Amazing season for him
3:16 a meme is born...
Shouldn't have sacked Bielsa in thd first place.
Pedro porro 🔥
You love to see it, one of the most despicable clubs in world football. Don't come back this time.
Ailing.  Get a haircut instead of looking like a wimpy girl.  Be a real man  long hair. Why. ??
harry kane doing a kevin phillips here scoring 30 goals for a side that just missed out on europe.
some of the worst defending i've seen in a long time.
Kane’s assist for porro was summat else
From an Everton fan, it is sad when any team is relegated, I hope you come back up again.
Leeds fans looked sad lol
Legend has it MD was doing the samba at the time
Not sure what Leeds fans' expectations were but I don't know why they're booing and stood with their arms outstretched in a shrug like that at the end as if they thought they should be any higher. Their squad is poor and there have been times in the last couple of years when I've genuinely forgotten they were even in the PL. Won't exactly miss them when looking at the Prem results next season.
Hahahahahahhahaha
People go on like the season Kane had is unreal or something the service he gets is world class I’ll understand if he got those numbers playing for Leeds or a Southampton
Sam Allardyce was a bad choice.
hope he gets  30 for united next season and I will be happy,
Moura what a player he is sadly he was wasted at spurs and another 16 year wait for Leeds all over again.
Why is the goal and minutes tab in the top corner not showing?
Moura with a goal of the season contender
Kane is so good
Leeds will have a tough season in the championship, in need of a total restructure, absolutely shocking
The way the Spurs players celebrate you would think they havnt been total crap all season
kane>Haaland. Would like to see haaland score 30 goals with a team like spurs
If haaland can score 36 open goal, one touch finish, inside the 6 yard box tap ins. How many goals would Harry Kane score in this city team? Would be way more than 36 that’s for sure
There are some people who genuinely pretend that Harry Kane is the reason Spurs haven't won any trophies 🤣
Like most, am delighted Leeds have left the PL. Their defence is dire.
I was there ….endless floating balls into the area ….they NEVER work  All five goals were scored with ball on the ground  When will they ever learn? There were so many poor player performances …too many to name names . If the had all covered ground and taken Tottenham on like Harrison did we would have won  He’s far too good for this squad .
30 league goals for a side who finished in 8th is seriously impressive. He was too good for Spurs three years ago. He needs to join a top club now enough is enough. World class players need to be playing in the CL and to win trophies. Spurs won't be able to replace him with anyone half as good mind.
Thought Sam said "he was in the same league as Klopp, Arteta and Pep ?" ah, he meant literaly  Nothing but a Fraud.
Bye bye leeds see you again in 18 years🤣😂🤣
leeds should have kept bielsa
Marching on to the championship hahaha
Relegation wasn't based on one defeat today.
When you see teams like Leicester and Southampton giving it their all even when it looks lost... the sheffield wednesday fans dragging their team over the line after being 4 0 down. The entire leeds set up (including the fans) should be ashamed of that.
seems that anandice failed hes magic  ..tough on leeds
Bye bye no one will miss you
In such an incredible mess even big Sam can’t fix them
Commiserations to Saints and Leicester for going down.
spurs didnt get europe tho lol
😂😂😂😂😂
Cooper Ayling
Awk well another long 17 years for leads 👋
So can we safely say that Allardyce is not as good as Pep or Klopp? His ego is the size of his belly.
Leeds United's appointment of Sam Allardyce was sheer folly and desperation.  Allardyce isn't fit to manage a any Premier League club.  If Leeds can get a decent manager appointed, give him some funds to make a few signings then you never know but I don't think Leeds will be far away from the playoff positions next season.  Tottenham have obviously missed out on European football next season but this might help them in the mid-term.  European football is obviously something the supporters want to see, but sometimes you need to take a step back in order to take 2 steps forward.   Hopefully without the sort of pressures and demands that go with the participation in Europe during the new season it might help Spurs to address some of the issues that have been holding them back.
Trash leeds got binned
Leeds are a seriously bad team. How many tonkings have they had recently especially at home???
Leeds don't have a single player of premiership quality.  And their fans are a disgrace too.  Good riddance
Loudmouth Leeds fans back where they belong.  In the gutter.  Beautiful.  😂😂😂😂
Hahaha scummy leeds bye bye
great goal from lucas moura harry kane has now scored 30 goals this season in a very poor side come on you spurs
Leeds, leeds are falling apart again, LEEDS, LEEDS ARE FALLING APART AGAIN
couldnt of happened to a scummier bunch of fans, good riddance
Poor Leeds Leeds Leeds 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
where they belong
Leeds in the mud
When kane wants to play be becomes world class
Farewell, Lucas Moura. You have made our club proud🤍💙🇧🇷
Just to confirm then.. Leeds thought Mike Basset would save them?
Well done Lucas! 🎉 great great finale!
That last spurs goal summed the players up, not good enough get rid of them
Seeing Ayling with that smirk wiped off his face is so satisfying
Kane has scored 30 goals in 2 premier league seasons. He didnt win the boot in either.
Leeds have needed a striker for two seasons and done nothing about it! Interesting way of defending, no one marking Kane!
Leeds going down surely ends all the ‘big club’ nonsense they won’t shut up about
The guy at the end is going to be a meme lol
Big Sam Alladyce on Talk Sport was talking like a Messiah for Leeds 😂 Legend.
Lets hope that’s the last we ever see of alladyce in management! 💩
Thank you Lucas. Club hero 🤍🤍🤍
Why are the players crying ? They knew they were relegated long before the final whistle .
Leeds brave resistance lasted 2 minutes
Back down to the championship 😅😅😅😂😂😂😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 .  There's only one United (Manchester)😀 😀 😀
30 goals in a season and you don't even nearly win the golden boot... madness...
Good riddance
We will be back in the Premier League within a season or two I reckon, we need a clear out and that includes both the players and the board
😂😂😂😂😂😂
😂😂😂 hold that leed fans
Before managing West Brom in 2021 he never got relegated as a manager & in 3 seasons he gets relegated twice 🙄🙄  Sorry Sam your firefighting days are extinguished 👋👋
As a Southampton fan, I really feel for Leeds and Leicester. 3 historical clubs going down and it is testament to the quality of the premier league. We played bad, no doubt and deserve the relegations, but the Championship will be one hell of a battle next year...
As a leeds fan, i turned off my TV after 60mins. Well played spurs but in a do or die situation with the odds against us it was like there was no fight in the players at all.
COYB
Not a fan but if leeds get the right manager next season i think they can go straight back up again
Leeds tho??? Hahahahahahahaha
Goodbye and good riddance Leeds, tinpot club 🫵😹
Bye bye Leeds 🎉. Have a great time in the championship.
What was fat Sam saying about his skill set????
Lol, last Premier League gig for that fraud "Big Sam" and glad to see the back of Leeds, horrible fanbase
WHY DID WE NOT BUT MESLIER OUT IN GOAL
Hahahahaha - Up the Toffees 😂😂
Good riddance
There was a long period of time Leeds United weren't in the Premiership and now they go back again. Hope they don't repeat it! I expect them back in the Premiership soon.
Whats Ayling doing Like?
praise after praise for teams playing against Leeds, but why? We have been awful for 2 seasons and defensively inadequate, so why applaud what is handed to you with ease. Even Bournemouth managed 4 against us, relegation is nothing more than what we deserve. Hopefully we bounce back by backing youth
30 goals for a team performing this badly is incredible.  no offense to Tottenham, but Kane deserves to sign for a club that can match his stature,  where not everything is entirely on his back.
Lovely weather again. Beat Fulham. Finished 3rd. Leeds back where they belong. 😂
Harry Kane has no medals? Wow
Lol Leeds 😂😂
Watched the days action in a sports bar in Belfast. Leeds United, you're a disgrace to your fans. Everton and Leicester are awful right now but they left everything out on the pitch today, whereas Leeds were abysmal. Meanwhile there were fans of pretty much every Premier League club watching their respective games around the vast pub. The Leicester fans were vocal and optimistic when they had hope, and accepted their fate with good grace. The Evertonians sat in frozen terrified silence, barring when they scored and at the final whistle. {it's easy to be magnanimous in victory but they were excellent with their Leicester and Leeds counterparts at the end} However, the Leeds fans, sang and cheered for 90 minutes. Your players are not worthy of your fans. Total aside from the relegation battle but Belfast's Villa fans are a credit to them while it was telling that the Manchester United fans were locked in a wee small bar away from everyone else. When I asked why, the barman replied. They're morons and everybody else hates them.
Rofl..from all at Everton x
Leeds, Marching down forever.
Welcome back to the championship Leeds, back where you belong.
30 premier league goals and no  golden boot.. Astonishing given that the last few years you only needed 20/21 goals to get it
Top player Harry Kane.
4-1 again aswell 2004 really is repeating itself
😂😂😂😂
What's up with the big screen?.
PATHETIC CLUB . . . BYE BYE 👋
Sad to see leads go but honestly deserved the way they’ve performed this season. See u in the championship leeds
LOL! Down you go Leeds!🤣
Not a Leeds Fan, was so happy for ye when ye came up and thought Bielsa was fantastic in how he structured yer team and knew the culture of the fans and understood the demands of the premier league.  Marsch just didn't get the club and the signings he made didn't have the right mentality other than Gnonto.  Hopefully ye'll be back soon.
All good crying like babies, no back bone all season
At least Lucas moura scored. Although I'm not a spurs or leeds fan I'm gonna miss him. (Unless he stays in prem)
This karma for the Leeds players ignoring that young boy.   You love to see it 🥲
30 goals in such crap season, my goodness how good is kane🤷🏽‍♂️
Nobody will miss Leeds
Leeds didn't play well.
Bye bye Leeds 🤣🤣🤣 terrible football club anyway so no one will miss you, playing your football in the championship 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Marching down together 😂
Leeds will return . 👍
Bielsa should have stayed.. ooh well, now he’s managing another World Cup team so all power to him
😂😂😂 bye Leeds
Thanks for the memories Lucas. What an exit. ❤️❤️❤️
I wish Kane had left Spurs earlier in his career, he deserves numerous trophies.
This is big sam moment! This is football heritage, ladies and gents 🤣  Better than Guardiola Mourinho klopp and sirAlex taken together! 😂😂😂😂😂😂
We have been appalling all season and we went down with wimper. Not the managers fault, it's the players (hope we sell the bloody lot except Wober, Knonto, Adams & Rutter) and the board. Hopefully Radz has gone already.
Leeds falling apart again 😂
Absolutely gutted , the only thing premiership quality about our beloved club .......... Was our ganbase i applaude you sll 👏👏 . Message to the board and owner .....   Clueless ....... Frauds ......... Cheap ..... Heartless conmen ! The players werent good enough we knew last season cant blame them . Its the ppl in cgarge that lut thise players in a position they could never succeed . Shocking
That thumbnail of Luke Ayling being a weeping angel is priceless 😂😂😂😂
Would have much preferred Leeds or Leicester to stay up, hopefully they come back straight away
Leeds are the biggest club in Yorkshire. The fan base is massive. What a tragedy for them.
This is heartwarming to see for any fan of football. Bye bye scummy Leeds 👋🏼
Even the most positive minded Leeds fan would have expected to go down today but I think the disappointing thing is there was very little fight against a Spurs team with a poor recent record.
Miniminter ain't gonna be happy with this one lol
worst team leeds have ever had and thats saying something. sunday pub team players
Championship, place were they belongs
So sorry for the Leeds fans , am an Evertonian and it could have been us , come back stronger lads 🤞👍
As a Wednesday fan this sucks I hope Leeds will make a comeback soon and come back a well run strong football club like they deserve and should be
Great to see 👊🏼😂😂🇾🇪😂😂👊🏼
Marching on together down to the championship lol.Them Yorkshire lot need to stick to playing rugby that's all there good at
How terrible do you have to be to get beaten by tottenham
some teams are just not cut out for the prem lol  leeds are a small club 😭
*I can’t believe Tottenham actually managed to win a game for once.* 🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
Thank you for the memories Moura. I know the mistakes this season were massive but your impact to the club has also been massive. Goodluck on your next move ❤
Leeds fans sense of entitlement is one the great wonders of English Football
Now you take more fans with you lot, down to the Championship...hahahahahahaha
As a spurs fan, i was suprised at this match, thought he would lose 😂
sorry to see leeds go down..massive club needs to be back in the big time soon.
Goodbye Leeds.  I hope your fans learn some valuable lessons and become a little more humble the next time you gain promotion to the Prem and are more bearable than they have been for this current failed run in the top flight.
Glad it's over ,MOT
Spurs only win when it's not important.
Kane master class
BAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHAHAAHAHAHAHAAHAH scumbags get back to the championship where you belong and never come back. sheeds are falling apaaaaaaaaart again
Leeds scum relegated thats at least made my day 😅😅
The only winners from Leeds demise are all the managers/directors laughing their way out with their severance pay.
Super Moura. Hero of Amsterdam. Happy he got a farewell goal.
i love harry, would love him to stay, but its sad to see him go
Leeds have been pathetic this season and fully deserve relegation.
Always nice to see Leeds United lose....But to see them get relegated is bliss 😂😂😂
Tell me why Kane shouldn’t get player of the season over Haland, 8th place side with controversy on and off the pitch and ends the season with 30 goals, that’s more impressive then 36 in a super team imo
Immaculate job Sam. A job well done! Now go to the bank and get your pay cheque.
good riddance
Leeds scum 😂😂😂 hope you go back down to league one soon
Ive just noticed something. Last 3 times Leeds have been relegated from the top flight (1960, 1982, 2004), the exile has been 4, 8, and 16 years respectively. Judging by the mathematical pattern that is emerging, does this mean they'll have to wait longer to return to the Prem than Luton? 😂
Tottenham always have a good last game at the end of the season
and not a thing of value was lost.
love kane, Id say he would be amazing for Madrid!
HARRY KANE
Happy for Lucas. Rotton season for Spurs. Woeful football to boot. Sorry to see Leeds go down. COYS
Gutted for Leeds
leeds have been an abomination they have only just come up and they are going back down
Marching on together...into oblivion.
BIG CLUB.
Tottenham forgot to change the difficulty rating from amateur, lucas moura 🎉
Great for moura feel for him because he’s been wasted at spurs this season, he deserved alot more cause he’s quality man
Net gain for the league
Moura really said "its fine ill do it myself"
Cue a stream of thick Bamford apologists all squealing ‘we go again’. 🤬
so happy for moura done all he can for the club amazing player
Leeds Leeds are falling apart again
Guffaw guffaw guffaw, back where they belong
*PHAHAHAHAHA!* absolutely brilliant, bye bye Leeds you will not be missed *AGAIN!*   See you in another 16 years  🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
For the last two seasons leeds were so bad
Adios Lucas thanks for the entertainment 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻  And Leeds back where they belong 😂
I told Leeds at the end of last season to get a proper coach, they kept Jesse Marsch and his "headless chicken football" put Leeds in a downward spiral. As always I was right.
Marching on together just to see you relegated let's all laugh at Leeds
Leeds bottled it once again 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
30 league goals for kane I know he's done that before but it's still impressive in this Tottenham team
Congratulations to spurs for winning the 8th place trophy, and now I'm guessing spurs fans are looking forward to seeing their team play in europe next seas...oh wait...
With that result, Championship can have its own Pep Guardiola in Sam Allardyce 😂😂😂😂😂
If you want to know why we’re getting relegated look at the first 2 goals! Absolutely pathetic
I will call you in 19 years
hahaha moura
Good riddance horrible club 🤮
As a MANCHESTER UNITED FAN all i have to says is.....HAPPY DAYS..😂😂😂😂😂  HA HA HA HA HA BYE BYE BYE BYE HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA
bye bye Leeds
Absolutely buzzing Leeds are relegated back to where they belong. Going to be a great summer for all football fans
Lucas Moura what a great run and goal, always nice to see players score on their farewell game
Leeds came up with this gung ho crazy football and went out with a whimper.   You have to credit Kane  what a return which on most seasons gets the golden boot but for the loon at City.
Crazy individual season for Kane, wasting his time/career at Spurs!
We're a joke, can't understand what a "must win game" is. Got what we deserve and we're marching down together
So leeds come back to the prem make a big fuss about it get spanked by united a few times and go back down😂😂😂😂you couldnt make this up
Bye bye leeds you won’t be missed xoxo
Ha by 👋
😂😂😂😂😂😂 bye
Unlucky Spurs! UTV!!
shame they didnt take forest with them!!
Don't mind. Leeds are very poor to watch anyway
Kane is incredible. Surprised spurs have managed to keep him so long.
I have no love for Man U, but if they get Kane, then they'll be a force next season
LOL thats what you get for bringing a fat dinasour
lucas moura has been so clutch for spurs in big games, glad to see him get his farewell goal.
Suppose we deserve to get relegated after that performance. Spurs arent a bad team as such but we gave the ball too often and didnt demonstrate much urgency or passion
Who is going to be the best promoted team next season
Losing to spurs is humiliating enough, but a must win game against spurs and you still lose? Embarrassing
cant even be mad at the comments, we deserve it.
Leeds didn’t deserve this. Hope they go back up
Kane is unreal 30 prem goals with only 12 big miss chances. (Context haaland has 36goals but 28bcm). Dude is feeding of scraps maybe if Tottenham was a serious club and actually bought a component backline maybe he'll finally be back to comepting for silverware like he was under poch. World class striker 👏
Harry Kane  is no doubt a Premier league Legend what a player any club would  be absolutely  lucky  to have him  end of story .!!
Leeds will not be missed begone to the championship
Final-day Kane is a guaranteed 9/10 performance. Commiserations to Leicester and Southampton for going down.
hahahahahaha leeds r ded
Haahahahhahahahaahahhahahaha
30 goals in that spurs side is absolutely unreal
Imagine being relegated by spurs 😂
about time the scum got sent back to where they belong hyahahahhahahahahaha
Kane needs to leave Tottenham, my boy deserves better smh
Brilliant 👍🏻
Why people think Leeds deserve to be in the Premier League or add anything to it is questionable! They only have a big fan base and thats about it. Sheffield Wednesday have a big fan base in League 1. You earn your Premier League position.
Leeds get battered everywhere they goooooo, everywhere they goooooo
We All Hate Leeds Scum!
Leeds United have been poor.
They have Bielsa to thank for their recent success, now it’s back down to reality
Disappinting
Let the rebuild begin
See ya later leeds, made up to see you go
Bye bye 👋 👋 👋 Leeds United it's been nice knowing you
Kane is something else, to be scoring 30 league goals in such a dire spurs side is remarkable, hope he moves he doesn't better.
How was that not an assist for kane?
I’ve said it on the bt highlights but I’ll say it again, someone needs to get Jack Harrison in the summer, quality player who I would love to see stay in the prem
kalvin philips, are you happy now
3:17 “Behold! The one team getting relegated who nobody feels bad for!” 😂
MOT WHAT A TEAM AMAZING AFTER WINNING 4 2 AGAINST WOLVES THIS TEAM IS AMAZING MOT MOT MOT MOT MOT
Yessssss get in Leeds relagation is a tbing of beauty terrible club terrible players the championship is  awful I'd rather my club fold than play in the championship hahahaha
I've never seen a team make Tottenham look so Good. Even a tired Lucas Moura scored. farewell Leeds 🤙
Money well spent on BFS. Who will be the sucker next season?
you have to feel for leeds here
Amazing moment for moura his final touch for spurs being and incredible goal
Tottenham 💀💀💀
Poor leeds united. 😢
This seemed to be the battle of the bottle  jobs !
What a lovely goal for lucas moura to leave with 🔥
I’m so sad I can’t say it’s the history of Tottenham
Deserved. They’ve conceded 78 goal this season 😂
Wahahahahaha
Kane with 30 goals still no golden boot man i feel for him
Imagine scoring 30 goals and not even qualifying for Europe. Harry Kane is too good for Tottenham he needs to move on.
Kane scoring 30 goals in my dead team 🙏🏻😟 COYS
Didn't deserve to stay up. Shocking team players arnt willing to fight i hope we can get some real footballers and come back stronger 🔵⚪️🟡
Great game!
Hahaha bye bye dirty yorkshire dingles 😂😂😂
Kane is absolutely insane. 30 pl goals for a side on 8th is more impressive than 36 goals for a side dominating the league. He has won spurs alone 24 points, without those of which spurs would be level on points w the teams that just got relegated (36)

COYS LUCAS MOURA
Yes leeds are down!
Porro lookin real good for us imo should start RW over kulu coyss
Bye Leeds 😊😊😊

Leeds Are Not Good Enough For The Premier League.
don't worry, they'll be back in the prem by 2040
Never good enough for prem 😂😂
Lol bye Leeds
Only Leeds would hire Sam allardyce to keep them up and still go down
As a Leeds fan this is disappointing
Wow.
First here
😂😂😂😂😂😂
This team is allergic to must win games 😂😂😂
