I love listening to her. She looks radiant
Oh please! This woman had her whole family living in the marital home.  Their last vacation was very telling.  Tell the truth about why your marriage ended and stop the nonsense, men don't usually file for divorce, so.....
Money Money Money is where her and her mom's focus is.....HAVE YOU SEEN ANY OF THEIR VIDEOS😏
I never heard of Jeezy, no shade just not my genre of music.  Watching all the videos Jeannie Mai  made prior to all hell breaking loose she and her mother praised him to the high heavens  the mother thought to add his name to a tattoo along with her other children 😲😳 who considers doing that⁉️ if this man was so terrible.  Absolutely NOBODY‼️.  HER videos showed him to be a calm mellow person just the opposite of her demeanor......these were observations after watch HER VIDEOS.   Someone is lying Jeannie Mai .

If you think about men you will hate them all. This young lady did not want kids but then some hooligan shows up into her life with his own agendas and lead her on only to divorce her…. Make this make sense.
What did you expect getting involved with a rapper.
She got a beautiful child out of it too 💜
This doesn’t change the fact that Jeannie is top-tier 💅 🫶🏼🥰
I am so happy she has her daughter cause at one point she didn’t want kids and I’m sorry her marriage did not work out, but I’m happy at least she has a beautiful baby girl to show for it and someone to love and support her in life as she gets older❤
She's for the streets
The feminist movement would tell us we don’t need children literally there’s no other reason to live for but that😊
I THOUGHT SHE WAS A BODS !!!! 😂😂😂
She should have married Jeezy in the first place
Karma will get him back  It always comes back  He deserves to be alone forever
I've always loved her.
Jeanie Mai you are so strong <3 you're killing it mama
Who is that in all that black Jennifer
Who is that in all that black Jennifer
Hay Jeannie bbym
Love me some Jeannie
God nowyou got your dark meat gone😂😂😂😂🤡🤡
I LUV Jeannie Mai Tho!!!
Well well well I remember when she first got with this man…who had a girlfriend.
Crona Hills
Ledner Cliff
Women with this empower shit is the reason why Kamala will lose. Feminist
I love Jeannie🤍
Money , cash app 😂😂 I swear if I heard her say that with her lil baby voice, I'd send her a few dollars to 😂😂
She did what most Asian women do after having a baby she closed her legs
Im.not surprised they got divorced..He has two baby mamas,arrested many times,amd with Mama Mai being intrusive ( based on what i read..maybe not true)
Bull… shit
Damn she looks FABULOUS !!!☀️
I love you Jeannie Mai ! From Ethiopia =🥰  , Not easy to talk about once Hurt but , Jesus Loves you and He will mend and Redeem your broken heart my Dear hang on and pray.😘
Yes to the Bay!  I love Jeannie.
Oh please. Shes lying through her teeth and a pretender. She just wanted a mixed child
I'm glad seeing this side of her from the real girl that never wanted kids.  Couldn't get it.  Couldn't understand it. And said she was too selfish. And now maybe she will change on some of her political and biblical views that there is nothing wrong with being a mother
No more side dishes for her I suppose
new earrings new ropes new srirelis an etcetera princesa mahal kita sincera tu piotyr
Twice divorced so either she chooses bad men or she’s the problem
Girl BYE you not innocent. There she goes blaming her daughter learning wth from Jeezy family. She always play victim.
Stupid men don't deserve someone amazing like her . She is so strong and intellectual.
I remember seeing her video about getting engaged. I already knew at that time it’s not gonna last. Marriage now a day is a joke especially for celebrity.
😢😢😢😢
I AM THE DIVINE LIGHT SAYS THE ONE ❤️  CAN YOU ALL SEE ME NOW 😊❤?????
YOU KNOW WHAT I LOVE TO SEE ❤ KEEP IT REAL ❤
Gold digger. She signed a prenup please follow that.
I like Jenny but she seems like she doesn’t know what she wants and I feel like she messes with men’s hearts come on now Jenni Mai.
He clearly was just with her for business and did her wrong
I still like Jeannie Mai lol🤷🏽
Praying for her 🙏🏾
I thought these woman said she don't want kids,I feel women don't know what they want
23 months?!  Why not just say that she is almost 2 😒
The more I look at the both of them I’m starting to think it was Jeezy where the problem lay. I’m just saying
Jeezy lucky to get out now 😮She needs a lot of therapy.
thats what she gets for submitting to a man that has 2 babymamas lmaooooooooooo
Jennie you are a Woman of Wisdom❤
Jennie you are one of a kind❤ i love your style 🙏 he didn’t know what he had in you.
Jeanie Mai.........My Bay Area Girl!!! San JO!!!!!!!!
Just give her a show, she will be great.
Cmon now you comment people   Have you not noticed every show since Oprah, Sally jessie raphael Ricky lake They all follow the same meta  For deeeecades now   Public eating it up like its fresh out the garden.  Guests, struggles, its never their fault, over come, back on purpose, then oh this and that always someone else. At best a slight brief admission that they had some exceedingly small part to play in their own situation, with a very small admission they had something to do with the situation they put or found themselves in.   Even then that's something mostly reserved for the older guests 35+ if that part comes out.   Now because you don't agree with what im saying, because you don't recognise it, doesn't instantly make me a hater.  But you guys need to stop investing time in this self inflicted ish then saying positive's things when half if not more of the trouble was instigated by the very guests themselves.   I;m not a hater what i am is tired of many comments from people that really just dont see it for what it is, then shouting you go queen live your best life and manifest things and that the guest deserves or didnt deserves a negative outcome, after listening to only one side of a story that is perpetrated by the main character, who will never say anything bad about themselves of course!  Their career depends on it.. $
Jennifer said "Viamnese"! WOW! 🤔🤨
Still trying sooo hard to be a wannabe black chick! It will never ever happen so stop trying so hard! NEXT! 🤔🤨😒🙄👎🏾
First of all a lot of celebrities come on talk  shows to discuss up and coming events without asking about personal life but jennie mai want the questions about her divorce to be asked so she can have her pitty party
Jennifer Hudson is a  horrible host I don't know how long she's going to be on this ....
She said she was gutted I felt that! 😢
I'm probably the only one who finds JHud to be so fake and pretentious. I can't watch one minute. And Jeanie , please go home and reflect.
Really Jeannie? Don’t teach your daughter the love of money, it is the ROOT of all EVIL! The MOST important thing you can teach your daughter is the fear of God! Something you should learn yourself, nothing in life is more important than that!
why she need her exs husbands money? and plays the vitim to get it? I WAS FORCED TO SING PRENUP, woman google says you have a 4 million dollar network, TOP 10 RUGIDAS DE TRIPAS YOU ARE RICH YOU DONT NEED HES MONEY, HE CAN STILL SEND CHILD SUPPORT, MAKE YOURE OWN MONEY
Im Glad Jeezy is Doing Great
Shout out to young jeezy for standing strong. She tried to manipulate him to soon not knowing about that prenup. Now she wanna Act Right.
She tried to play Gatekeeper to a Black Man. Jeezy did right.
😮💯🙏🙏💖💃
Now she trying to take his money talking she didn't have enough time to go over the prenup 5 days before the wedding now they divorce and she want to change it shawty looking for her golden ticket like the rest of them
Nobody had this much support for her ex husband. I wonder why?
it is not easy , going through divorce 2 times in a few years gap! I pray God to comfort her and be a better mam  for the little girl.
Women can never take an L , how you empowered in 2nd divorce 🤦🏾‍♂️ , bih suck as a wife
Two very different men. Two divorces. The problem is not men--it's HER!
Amen new baby❤new world ❤new thought process❤so so true!!!
Ur so strong sis ,i been there before it hurts,but i think ur handling it well😘
Why can’t she say exactly how old baby is? Why does she have to say it in months nobody wants to be doing math to figure out your child age
Pure narcissist bull always pretending to be so interesting n happy then reality hits🤬🤬🤬💅💅
Jennifer:  please stick w/ singing.  You are suck to be the show host.  You have lots to learn from Jennie Mai.  Please believe me.  Go back to singing.  BTW, you look great (loosing weight I meant).
Jennifer Hudson looks like Oprah in her younger days.
Jeannie comes across as a total narcissist, sorry. Toxic AF.
This happens to European women with African husband…after the black man gives them his seed, the contract is fulfilled. Janie got her cute mixed-raced baby, she is not mad, trust.
Jeannie deserved  better. ❤❤❤❤
This baby has changed her you can tell
I am sorry I love Jeannie Mai but I felt she chose badly. A rapper, I knew from the beginning they were heading nowhere
It’s sad what she is going through but she got a beautiful daughter out of it 🥰
Jeannie A Great Woman
Jeannie is so beautiful 😍
Jeannie is so fake.
Good luck to the next female that ends up with Jeezy. She will need all the luck she can get!
💯
Sad. I always had a feeling they weren't forever though. 😕
Her told her a billzilion times he was divorcing her. She just ain’t believe it till she saw it in the media😊
Going all these black woman shows. Cause she know the sister love a good tear down of a brotha. A couple “yes guurl” and “queen” and yall will betray all brothas
🙄
23 months= almost 2 Lets just say what it is😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Are you teaching her “viemnese?” 😅
Jennifer approaches these questions with so much compassion. That is really hard to do.
perfect, i love this interview
It breaks my heart that men end a relationship with a good woman to be single , so they can have sex with younger women .  I'm a man posting this.   I have never cheated on a woman and i choose to be a good man to women.
I am so happy for you Jeannie...blessings girl..so strong...you are an amazing woman ❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉..big hugs..blessings from Guyana 🇬🇾🇬🇾
Jennifer sounds to plastic not transparent
Remember when she insisted she didn’t want kids. Now she has one and sees she was wrong
Not going to lie…. It seems Jeezy maybe didn’t want a psychologist as a wife. She doesn’t seem that “normal” conversations are allowed w/out some sort of psycho analysis….ijs😮
Jeanie is everything😍😍😍🔥🔥🔥🔥 his loss…..
Love "D" Chemistry Between  Jennifer Hudson & Jeannie Mai. Both of them have beautiful voice. Both have great fashion!!! These two DIVAS Rock! Keep on doing you!! ❤❤
She is a beautiful woman with a beautiful heart
As a husband, i can relate to jeezy on the unconditional love thing because although i understand that my wife loves me, but that love comes with expectations. Luckily for me though i had a mother who truly loved me unconditionally. RIP momma bear ❤️
Even though this year I met the most broken version of me I. also met the strongest version of me wow
I honestly feel heartbroken for her she wanted this to be her last marriage to anyone she was devoted and willing to change for him and had a baby she thought she didn’t want before him, I lost a lot of respect for jeezy
God bless you Jeannie 🫶🏻 Healing and strength
Bay Areaaaaa
Way to go Jeannie Mai.  You’r so beautiful 💕
Look at that, someone that said they never wanted children. Now that child is their whole world!
Ok jeannie gave jen the run down first ok Jeanie i really didn't care for her but maybe because jen could become the new oprah. Oprah use to get DEEP. I think you need a female Charlemagne for the new oprah though. With a touch of yee. Charlemagne more like wendy but has become more in-between oprah and wendy. I would LOVE another oprah. Oprah covered everything everyone scared of being canceled saying the wrong thing. What oprah did was report or pose the question that way its not viewed as her direct opinion. Jen too nice shes a mix of oprah and ellen. But if jen wants to last as long as oprah she has to find a way to get up in people intensely without them knowing.  Same with controversial topics. Just my input.
I hate how celebrities make it seem like their marriage is so perfect like Jeannie and really it’s not and ends in a quick divorce.
She looks great this show
I feel like the way Jeannie said she found out with the rest of the world that she was getting a divorce seems calculated. No hate to her though, I love her content.
I think Mai is so fake and really stunts when she talks to black people
I love Jeannie Mai & love how she talked about the Bay Area! Im in San Jose to so i sure know what Jeannie's talking about when shes talking about the Bay! I like seeing how positive she is about the divorce & wish her the best!
Let Watch Tv in Vietnamese That Quick Len
Some husband needs a Will Smith. Be strong Jeannie.
Its baffling to me how many people DO NOT believe that a woman can be her own devil. Or that a woman can do no wrong...LORD HELP US ALL...
❤ oh my Jeannie! The best is yet to come. Sit and wait because the lord will make away some how. Your face is true blessing 🙌🙏❤
She knew it was coming she didn't believe it would happen
She lasted longer with her first husband.
Sick of all these celebrities, pretending there is no Gen@cide going on. Honestly while this is going on, it is hard to watch. These people who add no value to our lives. It's just another way to distract us from what's going on🤢
Go Jeannie Mai!! You are amazing. Just Keep Going!!
What about the Father?
Two sides to every story . I feel bad for anyone going through a divorce and rough times . Stay strong
Jonh 3:16 (NIV) For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.🤍  Give all Your worries and problems to the Lord. And being to trust and believe in Him.❤
She’s divorced again? Wow I don’t know I’m tired of of these types of masculine women all the fakery and how “strong” she is lol it’s fucking sad
Miss me with the BS!!!
That's your problem being selfish
She brought that for being a gold digger
Miss me with the BS
Subliminal shot about his family.
Finding her strengths?    😅😅 Girl STFU !!  You Had your own before you met your husband... you just wanted to remain strong in your marriage.  No one is buying this bull Sh!T ...
The marriage may have ended but she walked away with the biggest blessing (her child).
Still all she think about is her selfish  self and money, the girl is fake to the end,no twisting  it she's  a fraud
23 months... so 2 years for other people.
I noticed after Jeannie's first divorce that she was close to her mother, and loved her very much, but after her husband Jeezy entered her life, Jeannie's relationship with her mother was plagued with problems! It's as if the strong bond that united them is no longer necessary! Now I wonder if this is the case with her daughter entering her life, there is no longer room for her husband! If that were the case, they should have waited for the water to return to its normal course. Anyway, I'm so sad for them
She’s ❤
I feel this will lead her to reconnect to her  Christ relationship.  I believe Jeannie was still hurting from her first divorce, and trying to prove something to her ex-husband and bounce back,  the devil set her up, she started straying from her Christian  principles.  Just my observation, and will be praying 🙏
If Jeezy sprang that divorce on Jeannie the way it was reported and how she says she found out, he is going to get dropped kicked by Karma so badly. I don’t claim to know what happened but when someone mistreat you the way that was reported they just don’t know how hard it’s gonna be for them. Karma is a bitch that repays you for everything that was maliciously done to hurt someone and you know you are suffering because of your past.
Jeannie you got this. Just continue to put God first in your life. God gave you Monaco for a reason. He knew you would need her for such a time as this ❤️💜🩷.
Sending her a ton of hugs ❤
Sounds pretty corny and cringey
Sending her blessings. She's strong and this too will pass.
"I met the most broken version of me, but I also met the  strongest version of me"  Wow, I felt that!
She shaded the shit out of her daughters black side
Guess all that submissive keep a blkman jargon she was selling blkwomen didn't work out for her. Wish her all the best moving forward with her life.
She's painting Jeezy as a bad guy, but excluding the fact that her and Mario Lopez had a thing going behind clothes door, clear cut narcissist
She's a narcissist, she makes everything about her
YOU ALWAYS DO GREAT SHOWS.😊
shes so hot
Why can't these people conduct their lives in private?
I was through the same situation 'divorce' it the most painful thing in life but I thank God am now heald and looking forward to find love again. Annastasia watching you from Africa
So very sorry that her marriage ended. She handed that question very well. Wishing her happiness
She needs to focus on God
Women getting discarded for unacceptable behavior needs to happen more Being Beautiful isn't an excuse to act out on good men, that are serious about being husbands. They need to find their feminine energy being feminine isn't about looking sexy its being humble towards your husband and providing peace in the home.
Such a beautiful soul she is, blessings to her and her family, she's going to be fine. Nothing beats a peace of mind!! ✌🏽
I don’t feel this is our business..  could you imagine?? Having to talk about it like that in front of the world.   No. Next question please!!
Well, I dont feel sorry at all, cuz she is a strong woman ❤,  trust me she is fine, she face evil and she let him go..she will always cary a smile cuz she is blessed with her baby and ''when a woman crys tear drops makes us STRONG''...LOVE YOU MAI GOD IS WITH YOU❤❤❤❤
I've been watching Jeannie since the first season of The Real. I remember when she was wondering if she will find love again after Freddie. I was happy to see her marry again and have a baby after she said she never would. It's sad to find out this news but I hope she continues to stay strong and be the best mom to that beautiful girl.
U have to be equally yoked to make a marriage work!
U have to be equally yoked to make a marriage work!
U have to be equally yoked to make a marriage work!
U have to be equally yoked to make a marriage work!
U have to be equally yoked to make a marriage work!
U have to be equally yoked to make a marriage work!
To not give her the basic respect of telling her in private vs letting her see it on social media is absolutely disgusting.
Vietnam lol😂
Jeanie spent her entire life up till she was 40 saying she knows in her heart and soul she doesn't want no kids and she's never felt maternal instinct. She gets divorced from first husband who had a baby straight away with someone else...Marrys Jeezy then gives in an has a baby to then find out she's getting divorced online with the rest of the world. I don't doubt for a second she loves her daughter but that is INSAAAAANE
Jeannie is still too much….she should calm down also the way she talks…
Love and prayers to jeanie
I really like how jennifer still maintains sensibility toward the people she interviews. Shes not just there trying to pick at them like a vulture. She did great.
This woman needs to write a book on her journey.... Shes stunning and keeps thriving, so many women go through the same put not on a public and global scale. God bless you Jeannie!
Do anyone really care. She said the black man is her side piece! Well now you know, you claimed it!😅
this is awesome Im from the bay area!!! woot woot
God Blessed her with a Child. That was Jeezies purpose in her life. To give her the biggest 🙌🏽 Blessing
Jennifer  tv hostess is not your calling
God bless you Jeanie with the trial you going thru I pray for your comfort peace and happiness for you and your child this too shall pass one of the best thing csme out of he marriage was your beautiful baby girl you will find happiness the days to come sometimes things don't always turn out the way we like but there's rainbow after the cloud you'll see what the devil meant for bad God meant it for your good one thing for sure God is not mocked you reap what you sow what was done to that person will get it back God has  a great plan for you and your beautiful baby hold on to God unchanging hands
She don’t care about that marriage
23 months 🤦🏾‍♀️🤦🏾‍♀️
The I am a victim tour has begun
Jeannie  Mai, Blessings to you and your little girl. I can see the passion in you on how you love being a mom to your little princess. Super exicted for you. Your a great mom continue being the best mom to your little blessing.
Go back home for Christmas 🎄 Jezzy.   Complete that family journey.
Damn I actually feel bad for her
Oh  so sad that Jeannie is going through her 2nd divorce 😢. Happy she has her little girl to cheer her up as she glows when she speaks of her ❤🎉
...I find it very interesting that people revert to the "time to find ME" journey when a marriage ends. Makes one wonder if that statement suggests that she was 'lost' during marriage. If THAT be the case.....then...........never mind. Moral of the story; marriage isn't just about love. Apparently.   -Signed, someone who's been divorced as well. 🙂
Jeezy, how manless of you.  I had an somewhat experience like that.
I was hoping that they made it, it's like he didn't even fight for his marriage, the first 5 years are the toughest years in a marriage, I wonder did they get counseling or therapy if not shame on him
2:14 hmmmmmmmmmm
❤love you Jeannie
I'm so proud of you Jeannie. That man never deserved you.
Jeezy made a statement saying she was aware of the pending divorce
She said she found out about the divorce when the rest of the world found out about it is that when she was married the first time she found out about the divorce when her husband and his mistress posted on social media that they were together. I feel so bad for her two public divorces with everybody, and all her business that has to be stressful
Bay Area boy over here Jeannie Mai
Lol, had to leave my baby mama too..women be trippin sometimes and then play the victim ..
She didn't even want kids but when she married Jeezy and decided to have kids. I do believe that she was really in love however I wonder what really went wrong. And I still remember those racist comments she made about dark meat and lite meat. Talk about Karma.
That’s was so wrong, learning that you are getting a Divorce with the rest of the country. Wow! I can tell you one thing for sure, no good luck will come from this. Time will bring about a change. Jeannie will rise and be more than anyone could ever imagine. God doesn’t like ugly and he’s not to crazy about pretty either. Time, just wait theirs a reason that it happens like it did. God will have his vengeance, because God said that he knows the true offender and motive and he will judge accurately and fairly. 🙏❤️🙏
Keep shining, keep smiling we love you ❤
She's a queens 👸
Jeannie can carry a talk-show all on her own. She and Tamera were the only ones who kept The Real Daytime alive. Def go solo : )
Jenn acted like she didn’t know that Jeezy dropped Jeannie like some fries in grease…
She is just beautiful inside and out!! 💛 Praying for her!!
She divorced twice because she wanted the marriage to work on her own terms. The domineering type. Marriage isn't for people like them. She sounds happier as a single mom. That way she should be
She should havr taken her own advice keeping white men as her main and black meat on the side. Her intentions were not real. She went out with him cause he was famous. She is angry, bitter, and fake. Her mom has the same track record. Her mom taught her. I hope jeannie doesnt teach her daughter to have an attitude.
I think Jenny being a Capricorn ♑️ and Jezzy being a Libra ♎️ 🤔 she took that chance in all, where it was a red flag. Libra is a blancer, so Jenny Capricorn ♑️  have a great oversize in being too forward, spillful with their mouths (n) actions. The female Capricorns can be quite dramatic in a relationship 🙄 crying, bickering so too much 😮. Jenny mother is her first teacher, so jenny can have some of her mother overhaul not realizing that she has her mom strong traits carrying moms characteristics. It was too much over drive from jenny plus her mom 👩  stronghold that's why he divorce jenny.😢
She was meant to be a mom. God doesn’t any mistakes, NEVER. Sending her love, peace, strength and renewal of the heart ♥️
Ooh so many men are narcissists they need therapy.
People get married and divorce like it’s nothing. Then date longer… marriage is no joke and not for the faint of heart. Marriage is supposed to be into death do you part not when you stop feeling butterflies
Every thing does happen for a reason, I always had a crush on Jeanie… I wish I could take her out on a surprise date and make her feel better 😢
Jeezy got his mother in law out of his 🏠
Jennie black men with small egg plants and minds quit on their women. Protect your child from his mental illness and blame game. You have brought so much joy to the world be glad you not with the Grinch.
Black dick it a drug
Jeannie sending ❤❤❤❤❤
Yeah if you’re actually LISTENING & DIGESTING what she’s saying… I can definitely see the problem with Ms. Jeannie smh. Black man dodge another billet kudos & I really hope he gets to see his daughter all the time, don’t be one of those Jeannie 🫠
Being blindsided is painful and abusive selfish act from Jeezy
I respect her resilience!!!
Jeannie is NOT the marrying type!
Now, wait one minute. Didn’t she have all the answers to keeping a man? Submission, letting the man lead etc. Are you telling me that this did not work? 😮 Say it ain’t so.
She should’ve kept her dark meat on the side and let the white/light keep her lean …
I love how she’s transparent without saying a lot. She is indeed strong and God has better in store for her ❤
The Bay! 🎉 were in the house!
Teaching your kid to ask for gifts and money is ok?
She wants to be black so bad. If she was just a regular person she could really have the right person for her. If you are not your authentic self, how will anyone match up to the real you?
Modesto ❤❤❤ the Bay is everything!!!
Never knew she was from the bay!#💪🏿
I hope for healing for you Jeannie 😢
Jennifer, don't have her on your show anymore. She is an opportunist of our community. Let her go find her own people show to be on to spread her lies and deceit. We too like to show compassion for the very people who wouldn't even spit on us to put out a fire.
she always talked too much for me. However, I'm feeling a sense of humility and growth. She will survive and realize that she is better off without Jeezy.
Wow she found out the same times as the world, Deng that’s crazy!
"Jeannie, uhmm, things are different from the last time you were here. Some unexpected news broke about your marriage? " I know JHud meant well, but it was cringe the way she asked that question. Lol
I can't believe Jeezy messed this one up. I would've treated her like the Queen she is.
When I found out at the same time as the rest of the world............wow...... I just read that  he wants to say that she didn't find out with everyone because they were in marriage counseling........being in marriage counseling does not mean that you know your husband is going to file court papers without telling you........that was cowardly. and that's what she means when she says she found out with the rest of the world............ he truly should stop watching her interviews and nitpicking  at everything she says. to make her look dishonest.....hasn't he caused enough pain..........he wanted to leave and he did......so just leave her alone already........May God bless and keep  you and Monaco Jeannie🙏🏽
I'm so proud of Jennie, beautiful & strong. Your daughter will be so proud 💕
I hope Jeannie really has the proof she's speaking about in that clause in paragraph 8 of their prenup that Jeezy did cheat of infidelity and be penalized and maybe get that prenup thrown out. I'm praying for you Jeannie 🙏💕
She is a STRONG WOMAN 💪 ❤.  I love her! I can't imagine finding out with the rest of the world that my husband is divorcing me. That's so humiliating and painful.  She is really brave!!! 😍
It’s so sad that she found out about the divorce the same day we did. Jeezy did her wrong.
Their daughter will embrace both families both cultures
You got this Jeanie! Much ❤❤❤
This is wonderful! God is so good all of the time!🙏💜😘😂
Shurrup lady you talk to much
I stand by jeezy
Jennie you are loved🤎🤎🤎🌰
Jeannie is a sweet soul. She’s going to get through this 🩵
Ending marriages or really long-term relationships in general takes ALOT out of you. It's a death in the sense that even though you know it happens, you're never quite prepared for the shift. Prayers for her and her little one. They'll get through it.
Love jeannie mai jezzy need be shame of his self divorceing her what shame he need Jesus for real it really hurt me when i heard this
I love Jeannie Mai! She is amazingly real! Sending up love and prayers to her! Although she is in pain, she is going to help heal others going through similar situations.
She found out when the world found out!? Dafuq!?
Jeanie so sexy
To be going what’s she’s going through and still mention that her daughter will be spending time with her dad as well shows how strong she really is..
She should not have found out about her own divorce online 😔
Thank-you for sharing this video with us. I/we all of our loving fans LOVE you Jennifer.  Merry Christmas & Happy New Year to you and your family from us and our 👪 families
Jeannie Mai  STAY PRAYED UP, STAY ENCOURAGED,  STAY STRONG, & STAY HEALTHY  Remember GOD got you ALWAYS!!!
Women all read from the same manual, first you are the victim, then you find this unknown strength, sounds just like Tia Mowry!
She doesn't age
The shirt on baby girl says “Yes, I look like my daddy”
You people act like Jeannie’s the only one that has ever been hurt before…she’s no different!!! There are plenty of women that’s been hurt either just like Jeanni, or worse… so PLEASE, enough of the Awwwe…I feel so sorry for her, crap.
A demise of a marriage  take two...
I HOPE YOU PICK UP THE PIECES OF YOUR LIFE YOUR GOING TO BE FINE ENJOY YOUR DAUGHTER MAKE TIME WITH OTHER FAMILY, PRAHY, AND GIVE GOD THE GLORY TO GIVING YOU A. BEAUTIFUL NEW OUTLOOK  ON THIS  E❤CHRISI
She looks so good
Jeanie is so amazing ♡ what a class act
I didn’t know she found out with the rest of the world..😢
I really liked the way JHud asked Jeannie about her divorce. Jeannie was married to a white guy but wanted to have a baby with a Black man that had money. She pretty much made that clear on The Real. JHud evolution as a talk show host is quite amazing to watch. She's leveled up.  I ❤ JHud.
Jeannie Mai response so rehearsed and unauthentic. She looks stupid. Just avoid interviews til your divorce is over. Her and Jezzy are clowning out here.
Jennifer said, Viem Neese.  Glasses donʻt make up for intellect.
Im From Da BAYYYYYYYYYYYYY🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽 Holla!!!!!! I love that Jeanie Mai is a BAY BEAUTY as well ✨️✨️✨️✨️ 😉😏  #bayluv #siliconvalley #bayareasfinest #SJ
Jeannie has a great personality 💯
This little girl 🧐🤔
She had to get married ahan.. yes have a child, that’s her ever😮 now👌❤️🙌
Love and strength hun❤❤❤
Why Jennifer act like she was surprised
No we don't know which side
Money and cash app 😂😂😂😂 So sweet!
That sucks to hear that
Yes Jennifer 👍
We are tired of Jennie go sit down some where she is not the only woman who is or getting divorced
It’s heartbreaking to know that she didn’t even know they were heading to a divorce and for her to find out when the whole world did, says a lot about his character or lack there of. God blessed her with her daughter for a reason and like she said, she found out how STRONG 💪🏽 she was going through this. I pray that God continue to keep you and your family in peace, continued blessings 🙏🏽
There goes that high value man
Well girl Stop Bragging how he was a great guy!!!! Keep your private life private
Love Love love jenene and family❤❤❤❤🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲 jamaica 🎉🎉🎉
Jeannie is a CLASS ACT!! I absolutely love how she lights up when she talks about her beautiful baby girl. You can tell by the videos and photos that Jeannie posts about Coco, that she literally is EVERYTHING to her and to their entire family. Continued blessings to Jeannie this holiday season (especially) ❤.
Mama mai probably went ballistic when she found out he wanted a divorce I can just imagine her bashing him !
She talk too much. That’s why her marriage ended. Added to the fact she moved her entire family into their marital home.
Jeannie, YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL God Bless You.  I am black and I don't know what happen but I pray for you and you family I am so sorry to hear about you and your husband I do not know what happened but I am praying for peace between you both.
Honestly, Jeannie acted as if she was above this happening to her because she wasn't a black woman. Ms. Submissive! Look at where it brought her, I guess she should have kept her "dark meat on the side."
❤These Ladies Just Keep Bouncing Back❤ Everyone Is Simply Human ❤ No One Has A Perfect Relationship ❤ No One Has a PERFECT FAMILY DYNAMIC❤ U Jus Gotta Keep Pushin❤ Stay ENCOURAGED EVERYONE!!!
See that’s why sometimes you need an actual journalist. Jeannie basically said she learned about the divorce through the media and Jennifer didn’t say anything or ask anything like it's the most natural thing ever ... WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU LEARNED ABOUT YOUR OWN DIVORCE THE SAME DAY AS EVERYBODY ELSE???😭😭😭😭😂😂😂 That shit is wild!!!
We are humans having a spiritual experience and must make this our priority (that inner work & knowledge of self); this we must realize because life challenges us in ways that we may never expect (sometimes, even though our children) so we cannot worship anything or anyone outside of Spirit. Well, we can but the wolf will inevitably come and blow our houses down time and time again...
As much as people like to talk bad about Jeannie and have their speculations on her marriage at least she is able to be honest and vulnerable in front of everyone. Not a lot of people can do that.
It's crazy how some people were critiquing Jennifer's interview style when this show first aired.... there's an amazing subtlety to how she speaks to her guests with such gentleness and kindness. I absolutely love this show and I need it to stay on for many years!!!
She got divorced twice...shes doing something wrong.
J. Hud has improved so much. Seems like she is finding her voice.
While speaking about her divorce, her voice sounds weak. I hope she finds the healing and peace she requires to get through this season. In Jesus name
Why does she seem kinda fake, she needs deep Healing.😊
She got punished she left her first husband and thought she would get better! Karma is real I hope her husband gets custody of her child because mama and grandma ain't fit to raise a child 😭
I'm thankful to God Jeannie had a daughter out of the marriage to be of comfort to her... Keep your head up high Jeannie, God got you!!
She didn’t even know he was going to file
He did her a favour she has all the qualities .trust me time heal all wounds god have some one better for her this to shall pass and we as woman we have to keep her in our prayers
I wanted them to win so bad
Everything happens for a reason!
23 months smh just say about to turn 2 or 2 so stupid
All she wanted was a baby by jezzy..lol lol
The Jeanie Mai Show would be BOMB! I’d watch it bc she is so vivacious!
Divorce is already an unpleasant thing betwen two private people, imagine when you're two public personalities!
Jennie Mai is so pretty!  She also has a beautiful tan.  Divorce sucks but life is still good if we choose to focus on our blessings and what’s good.  God bless her and her cute daughter
I knew her and Jeezy weren't going to last. I swear to you, I did not wanna think ill of their marriage. But they seem like two totally different people with two totally different values. Now although, opposites do attract, that doesn't mean they're compatible. Chemistry is not compatibility & vice versa. THAT MAN STOLE HER GENES!! Idc what anybody say. He impregnated her, she had the baby, then he left her high & dry. These kind of things happen to alot of men & women with good looks. He used her. He wasn't in love with her, like she was with him. I had a bad feeling when I first heard about them getting married. Karma gon eat him tf up if it ain't already💯 A woman full of love, light, and ambition just left broken... 😩 God Bless Her fr🙏
she found out shes getting divorcecd WITH US?!
This has been posted like 20 times 🤦🏼‍♂️
It's sad that he didn't respect her enough to tell her 1st. Lame on his part especially when she is the mother of your child. One thing is for sure Jeannie wouldn't have given up on him. He has served his purpose now he must leave her be.
It's so hard to find a good person, partner in life and when some  people find them....they don't know what to do with them...cause they like and crave  drama in life....they want attention and control.....and think they doing the other person a favor and expecting them to take the abuse they dish out😢😢😮    Jeannie and Keke deserve "MEN" not immature guys that want what's in season ❤❤❤❤❤
😢another black man creating a single mom.....and don't want another man around even though they rarely there.....just sad.....I think a few of these men do it on purpose thinking they can break down the woman(keke)and that these women will submit to them.....and don't like it.....
I just love Jeannie ❤️ so much 🎉
🙄
I mean ... so ? Out of all men you chose an Atlanta rapper. Lmaoooo. I actually feel sorry for Jeezy. This Asian girl is gonna try to destroy him.
How people turn to be motivational speakers after divorce...'Im loving and discovering myself'...lol
It’s so terrible. I hate this for her.. but in all actuality, ladies men will protect their pockets andtheir penis. I knew he would try to take that little girl away from her… because he doesn’t want to pay child support. It has nothing to do with nothing it’s all about money.! thank God, Jeannie had her own money🙌🏽🫶🏽🫶🏽 ladies take notes!!!
Utmost respect for Jeannie Mai sharing her personal life with us
She has had all the ladies of The Real on here except for Loni what is she doing now?! I miss you her!
I love Jeanie , NEVER like jeezy for her . He was only with her for clout and $$ .
Yay area!
I really don't think she was blind side
I was ALWAYS a fan of jeannie mai, even early days of The Real when she used to be bullied.
This was sad. She picked her apart in her marriage nothing about her career. She was low-key, throwing Shade through the whole interview at Jeezy.
0:49 you can actually see that she actually loved Jeezy
Really didn't believe she found out same time as the whole world that she was getting d*vorced. That's heartbreaking 💔😔
Keep trust in God and moving forward, Jeannie Mai! You have love and support from all over, but your biggest support is from your beautiful baby girl, Monaco. Also, I absolutely LOVE your game show *Raid the Cage!!!* You are a bright light during that show and your encouragement and joy for the contestants is infectious. *Keep Moving Forward!* 🤗🥰🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
The fact that she found it with the rest of the world I- Jeezy is truly a coward. And I grew up as one of his biggest fans. I’ll never look at him the same
"How old is she?"  "She's 23 months"  Yall still do that?? Just say 1 year & 11 months. Gosh.
How knows how they ended up at divorce. I hope they don't fight over raising the child or around the child.
So glad she’s finally speaking out 🙏🏻 he did her dirty. Didn’t even think she wanted kids, changes her mind & has a whole baby with him at 40 years old, only for him to leave her in the dust after HE cheated 😩💔 The baby’s not even two.
That's disgusting, she didn't find out that she was getting a divorce until the world found out. Dude you're a coward for that one 💔
Asides from all she went through she’s still a  strong, smart and beautiful woman.  God bless her and give her new strength each day to pull through this.  She looks GORGEOUS and her baby is so adorable, God bless them always🙏❤️
J HUD went straight to the point like
Jeannie us so strong and beautiful. Blessings to her and Monaco.
That's so crazy that she was blindsided. That's literally insane. How do you even recover from this....
Jeannie girl bypass me Jezzy has been so respectful about not talking about you. We not giving you no flowers Jezzy we stand behind him 100%. Jeannie better be easy cause she don't went the Snowman to come out.
It’s giving strategic interview with dog whistles just for Jeezy….Praying for peaceful, swift resolution for all parties involved, and so it begins.🙏🏽
Sorry JHud your questioning sounded so scripted and staged 🙄 Also why are you looking and acting like Oprah❓️
She said she didnt want kids but deep down i know she did. And maybe she just didnt love the first guy. Now after all that showing off she got the most of humiliation from his strong dark meat. He dropped her like a potato.
So now she knows that life is not predictable. Shes deeply hurt but i kind of not feel that sorry for her bcoz there was a moment of gloat, rub in baby mamas faces and too showiness when they both started even though theirs was so visible to everyone that their love was made of paper fire..... the mad even faked a lifestyle and pretended to be a shy guy. Welll
esteemed colleagues
Jeannie will be okay... She is a strong woman.
Imagine finding out that your marriage was ending at the same time with the rest of the world? Sucks
I feel like J hud interviews are so scripted. Just comes off so cringe sometimes. Love her as a singer. But I don’t see her as an authentic tv show host. IMO
Jennifer looking like Oprah here. Get it J!
Me l love her she looks still
I feel bad for Jeannie  She didn’t want this  Sad
03:33 earthy grit is also how i would describe jeannie. She is the prototype of a female Capricorn 🐐♑
Phuma kulempashamphasha engubaba wengane ezinye zezinto zenzeka ngendlela esingayiqondi siyakhulula ngendlela ❤
😂
he is smart  he never wanted to marry  her only wanted to make her a single mom  like he did to his other babymom   but she didn wanna have a child  without  being married so he  let her sign prenup so if they broke up he don't have to pay a lot of money   now she is a single mom and he dont have to pay her a lot of money because she sign the prenup so he still got wat he wanted
I love me some Jeannie I really feel for her she serves so much better !
I'm so heart broken for Jeannie! You are light and joy!
My holiday plans are watching Dawson's Creek 😂🎉
She found out that he filled for divorce at the same as the rest of the world???? What kind of person does that?
Jeannie has all of us sending her love!💕
Jeannie is so strong omfg
Monaco  won't  remember  shit about  the holidays   until she's  around  age  6-8😅😅
Jeannnie looks the eff good and you can tell she wasn’t expecting the divorce
Imagine calling yourself a real one, a honorable man yet your wife found out you were divorcing her via social media  with the rest of the world... He's heartless, hopefully the co-parenting goes well
Omg it must be so hard being a women
Love Jeni Mai, so glad her crown is straight and her footing is good. May God continue to bless your family's life.
Wait a second she only find out when the new broke ? Shock how low men can be
I can see why Jeezy left her. Am sorry, am not buying this sob story. Who teaches a 23 month old to beg for money. Her daddy rich, she don't need to beg anyone for anything. I know Jeezy must be tight right now, you got my daughter doing what?! Looks like the mama wearing the pants in that marriage 😅
I hope she is less boastful, feisty, loud am sad for her but she will pull through and triumph she will be fine.
Love you ladies #teamJeannie #teamHud 💯🥰🔥👑 Queens
Love Jeannie ❤️❤️ she will be fine!! She loved that man but life goes on.
But why does this woman always have to talk about her divorce? This is so staged. U already know Jeniffer ain't even comfortable asking her about that, but Jeannie's team most likely instructed her to. ?
Jeannie thank for the hook up olive oil is a game changer. Ashy were.
Jeezy that was so terrible of you if this is true
What the heck..grandma already teaching baby how to hassle for money and also spoiling her up until xmas.....😬😬
Jeanie looks so beautiful people. Wow
😢
God is good she have little baby girl
I love my fellow Cap. sissss 🩵🩵🩵
She found out about the divorce with the rest of us. Makes me wonder how rhey got to different books let alone different pages. Love from Kenya 🇰🇪
Jeezy is so wrong for doing that to rhis woman. At least have the decency to talk to your wife and say, i am going to the court gouse to file for divorce TODAY.
Jeannie is well-spoken and knows what to say and how to say it to remain objective while answering the question directly. Well, it was done.
May God bless her in all areas of her life forever & evermore........(BLESSED)
It's jeezy s loss to lose a girl like Jeanie I m sure god has other better plans for Jeanine mai
LMAO the way JHud asked "some unexpected news broke about your, (awkward pause) your marriage?" How cringe wtf the whole opening question was awkward AF. It's not a question, the news broke a while ago Jennifer we ALL know what that news was and why you'd word it as a question, I don't know. I will be glad when somebody step in and give her some actual hosting lessons fr  She said viamnamees 😂😂
Jeanie doesn't look like she is going through divorce.............She looks like a million dollars.
One thing about men, they will always put themselves first. And we go around acting like that ring is a prize from them and that they are the prize. If we want divorce it takes time to file and we go through a lot. When they want a divorce they don't have time for discussions and confirmations they just do it. I'm glad that she has her daughter to focus on. ❤
It was more than obvious Jeannie was blindsided by her divorce, I feel so bad for her but at the same time I love that she is not letting that man break her. Just look at her thriving and lighting up about her baby girl. I can't believe what Mama Mai is teaching Monaco, you just know she's going to be spoiled rotten for Christmas especially since her birthday is soon after along with Jeannie's. Sending positive vibes their way!
I LOVE HER BAY AREA QUEEN 👑❤
Jeannie is beautiful, love that dress! She’s getting her strength from her adorable baby Monaco. 🥰🥰❤️
I was very surprised she came back on the show so soon after her last visit. I’m so sorry that she is divorcing. It happens and sometimes it’s for the best.
I truly believe jeezy is  narcissistic or border line personality disorder.  He went straight from love bombing to divorce.  She found out from the media? Come on now that was uncalled for. Be a man. Jeannie got Monaco out of the situation so it wasn't all bad. You can def tell she's hurt. Ive been with a man who did that.. in love, obsessed ... bam walked out.. i difnt see.it coming. It certainly changed my perspective on relationships
Jeannie, you’re Awesome! You’re so Beautiful! I love when you said ‘ you met the most broken and strongest version !’ You’re a Blessing to so many women as to how you handled that situation ❤ Monaco is soooo Blessed to have you as her mom, and her entire Family! ❤️🔥⭐️💕💝You will be his one, that got away. Thanks for sharing your side of Empowerment!❤️⭐️🔥💝💕
I’m glad she came out and said what’s on her mind what she’s going through and being transparent about how She found out the demise of her marriage it’s very raw emotions 😢
I love Jeanie she’s my girl since the real I remember watching the real first episode when I was in high school. She holds a special place in my heart, and when I found out about her divorce I was so devasted. And it’s crazy because I told my bf at that time about her and how it’s sad about her marriage. And weeks later me and him unexpectedly broke and Jeanie really helped me through it. She’s looking so much better and I am too.‘love her
That's all we need to hear. I'm glad she's doing great!
It is really 😢sad the way she was blindsided ..she's a very strong woman..it's a blessing in disguise...🙏🏻
She's so beautiful
I can imagine being a mom is definitely a rebirth. You become a different person
But she left her first husband because he wanted to have kids and she didn’t so I feel like it’s just coming back to her
I CANT BELIEVE SHE'S 44???
This is sad.  I pray for their family.
Girl remember what you did to your first husband 😢pay back is a bitch  Girl bye ✌🏾
Bay Area 🎉🎉🎉
Don’t blame Jeezy on your daughter saying what the hell on Jeezy’s family like the Asian side doesn’t curse. You wanted a brother and now y’all not together you want to blame all negative things in your daughters black side.
Boo hoo Jeannie Mai if you acted right for Jeezy and be a good wife and stop playing victim you wouldn’t be a single mother.
This is why women are doing their own thing, without a man! Too many of them are not worth taking a risk. Keep your peace by keeping it moving.
I think or I hope Monico helps heal her relationship with her own mom.  In a time like this, that would be the blessing in disguise. ❤
You just concentrate on being the best mom you can. It don't try and compensate for the father's side. Let him do the work
Jeanie has a captivating authentic energy with strong family values I am sure will be incredibly missed. I know that man will regret treating her like that, they always do for high value women.
Girl power  don't let men  mistreat  us we deserve more
She looks damn good to be going through a divorce that’s for sure .
MONEY ..... CASHAPP............. WOW AMAZINGGGG !!!!!!!!!!!!! 🤢🤮🤢🤮🤢🤮 VALUES, RESPECT, HUMILITY, GENEROSITY ........ I GUESS ALL THIS QUALITIES DONT COUNT ........... ITS SAD NOW A DAYS EVRYTHING IS ABOUT MATERIALISM.............. DOESNT KEEP YOU  FROM GOING TRIBULATIONS .... MENTAL HEALNESS, INSECURITIES ...ETC  ( Money and cashapp DIDNT  keep you from being dumbed like an old sock 🤮 🤮)
That’s what you call a punk. When you tell someone you want divorce through the media. I’m glad that she don’t have that punk. anymore. you too beautiful and you’re very smart you don’t need him at all. Take everything you can get from him.
Jeannie deserves so much happiness. She has been one of my favorite people since finding her on The Real and she just seems so real and genuine
Unexpected 😂
She ate that thumbnail alive.
Jeannie is stunning
She probably did not compromise with jeezy she has a strong personality
Hate that he made her a baby mama but very happy she got her baby. ❤
I knew Jeanie was blindsided when she didn't say anything for weeks about her Divorce.. Most time the celebrity couple releases a joint statement.. He did Her dirty.. Where they having problems yes Its called teething and growing pain.. You work.it.out,you take.a break. But Bcos you are loyal & committed  to this person, you NEVER EVER BLINDSIDE who you Love.. It says a whole about your said character...
Nobody needs to know there is gonna be a separation with the rest of the world smfh.
Good luck  to you and baby.   You better off without him.
Damn Jeezy. I thought it was her but that wasn't cool
Jeannie said she found out the same time as the rest of the world🧐does that mean she didn’t even know till Jeezy post it online??😢
She wants sympathy from you 🦝🦝🦝while trending on racist Twitter for saying she needs protection from blk people🙄. Aw man! Jennifer Hudson, you’re a shucker and jiver too!!😞
Jeanie a real control freak - pay attention how she speaks about how her daughter is going to feel. Like what?
❤
She’s better off with her daughter than not having her…. Men are not worth it ..
He really blindsided her 🤯
I absolutely love love love Jennifer Hudson she is a thoughtful interviewer and covers the deep questions with class and gives the interviewee their dignity Chitowns best
Divorce is awful and extremely painful!!
Life is really crazy sometimes. She divorced her ex-husband (who was down for her over 10 years) because he wanted kids.   Then met Jeezy and had his baby. That was a slap in the face to her ex, so It’s hard to feel sorry for her. Especially with Jeezy’s track record.
She’s beautiful ❤
He’s a coward! What a punk to not even tell her before announcing it to the world. Smh
Wow Jeannie looks fabulous!!!
Yess she always represents San Jose 💕 Bayyyy areaaaa
Wow that hit, she said she found out about him divorcing her with the other people. He didn't even sit down like a man and just be honest and tell her he wanted out. That's so cold!. Wow she is a strong woman and I am glad her baby fills thr brokenness of her heart. Good job Jeanie you will heal in due time.
Nobody cares..dont feel sorry for her...she wanted his black "sidepiece" and thought he would treat her better than the others bc shes another race....no they are the same all the way around
Jeannie going on a Divorce interview tour lmao
jeezy is a whimp
As long as nobody has cheated, and the money is there, divorce ain’t so bad 🤔
He’s trash for not letting her know before the story broke
Wait..wait…wait…now it’s been a few hours since this interview, but people in their circle say she’s lying. They’ve been in marriage counseling for the duration of the marriage, so the divorce wasn’t shocking and surprised nobody but fans 😂…but keep playing this devastated victim role, chile 🤣
They were going to counseling so it was not a shock. Stop trying to manipulate the masses.
Sounds like Jeezy initiated the divorce.
Could it be karma from how Jeannie left her last husband?
She looks gorgeous
I love Jeannie's positivity!  Talk about pressing on and living your best life! Jennifer is a great natural interviewer. LOVE this segment.
What does that mean when she says she found out her marriage was ending when everyone else was? 😮
"I met the most broken version of me, I also met the most strongest version of me". Jeannie😢🙏🏽❤
Eyyyyy I’m from San Jose too!
She still looks hurt ❤😢
Gosh people are so GULLIBLE. Peopleeeee she is no Angel! 😱 omg guys. This is nothing more than a publicity stunt. Period. I’ll never forget not forgive what she said . With her culture snatchin self. And oooooohhhh hold up. Jeezy don’t get a past either. He should’ve checked what he was marrying. He wasn’t a DADDY KNOWS BEST to his other kids. So yeah… I don’t feel sorry for him at all! She get a talk show, I got time and will boycott the bajeezez out of it. Promise!
I love me some Ms. Jeannie Mai Jenkins soooooo muchhhhhh 🤩🤩🤩🤩😍😍😍😍🥰🥰🥰🥰!!!!!!
I love her more now
I’m glad she’s got a chance to tell her truth. It is what it is & she’ll be fine, many people have to start over from experience ❤
Yes jeannie putting on the bay!!!
Jeannie been through so much smh. From dealing with her mom, past abuse trauma, not sure about being a mom due to her trauma , now dealing with single motherhood, and moving on in her career …a lot mentally and emotionally but she’s a warrior. She’s doing a great job with her daughter and she think God knew she needed Monaco because she needed to see a side of herself that still was deeply in love with her despite the scars she gained. The fact that Monaco came right after she made peace with her past was a all in His timing.
❤ you Jeannie
Thank you Jen for having Lady J’s back! Cause Nia was tripping like Meagan to be standing behind some men. Hear both sides first atleast! Daym
omg baby Monico! thx for this interview Jennifer!
jeannie you are strong and radiant!!!!
at the time i find out at the same time as the rest of the world... he was dirty to her…
Stay strong lady, may God give you peace.
I still laugh at all the ridiculous YouTube videos she posted about her love life and marriage  LOL    Flexing on us all while he's busying cheating and filing for divorce  LOL
Sorry but i see straight through jeanie...she is so superficial....and loves to put on acts in the public. Girl bye!
also i think cross cultural relations is hard. some people dont understand big immigrant families and how you are ride or die for each other.
damn jeannie. you dont deserve any of this. we love you! you guve so much of yourself! its their loss if they cant value and accept and love ALL of you! much love! you got this! we got this with you! keep shining sis!!!
This Asian racist heffa is trifling and Jennifer is stupid for having her own here  smh😡
Y did you get divorced
I KNEW he blindsided her! What a coward.
My heart breaks for Jeanie. And I was not even a fan of hers. But I hope she takes jeezy to the poor house. I am so sick of these broken black men hurting women. Why the hell you married this woman knowing you was still full of unresolved trauma?
Damn if she found out when everyone else did that’s a punk ass move on jeezy’s part. Now on the flipside I think that her being married to the first guy and just dragging him along and not really loving him but it seems like a business move on her part so this is like her karma.
I don’t like the way that Jennifer posed her first question.
A lil quick innit?
The way Jennifer says holiday (ol-la-day) cracks me up. Jeannie Mai is taking lemons and making lemon-tini’s🍸It sucks to be blindsided by anyone…and publicly even worse. She seems focused on self-care, her fam and being surrounded by those that truly care for her - which may be the best remedy especially around the holidays.
That’s what you call a strong women , with morals . All the best Jean you deserve the best of it .
Everyone is like, awww, but we don’t know the whole story. So don’t judge her, or him. They know what it is.
Awwwwww...🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩Monaco looks so cute❤❤
Oh he'll crumble
Jeannie is a beast ❤
She’s so fake which side of the family😒
Wow, she said she learned about her divorce with the rest of the world. My heart goes out to her. Wishing everyone in the mist of this all the best.
She is so fake. I cannot
Bless her but that part when she said Monaco cussed and she go say u know what side of the family she got that from sorry Jeanie that was shady fr ijs
I been watching Jeannie since the real days  And I really am rooting for her she always comes out on her feet so I know she’ll be ok wish she didn’t have to Go through heartbreak to get there though God bless you Jeannie Mai
I knew it wasn’t going to last long lol
Jeannie continue being classy, you'll be alright in time.
Jeannie is more of a glowing, wise, resilient woman than ever. She has grown so much since I first saw her on The Real. Love to see her strong spirit and bright energy but also the softness that motherhood has brought. Such a joyful presence!
She chat too much and sound annoying.
she is a bad interviewer
Love u Jeannie xx
Bay area!!!
You can tell she genuinely is hurt:) I am grateful she is so forth moving:) you got it Jeannie
2:15 she couldn’t help herself but accuse the dad’s side for the use of that expression because they are not in good terms at this time. 🤦🏿‍♂️
She was married before for 10 years... Come on move on
Sending love her way! It’s hard nowadays people don’t value marriage anymore and are so quick to call it quits  and I can’t imagine finding out I’m getting a divorce through social media not having been married long and with a child . That’s tough
I knew it. She found out when we did. 🥺😞
This is too quick!
FINALLY HER TRUTH
That's a mama mai phrase! She learned it from grammy
Asians dating/marrying blacks - good luck with that lol 😂
Jezzy did ya wrong and will regret it
Its so sad to hear they are not together again. And am happy she changed her mind to be a mother look how she came alive when she talks about her baby. I cant wait to hear the stories and jokes monaca talks about jeannie like how jeannie talks about her mom. Bless up my child God be with you.❤❤
She looks like jeannies mom
No pass for you for the shinny piece of chicken joke jenny mai....
She looks pretty 🎉🎉..the whole look is golden
SMH...
Jeezy is disgusting
Don't care
*keeps scrolling* 1st time is a mis step 2nd time is a choice chiiiile u nevermind Jeezy filed & he is not going to pay u to pay ur 1st husband the alimony u owe him
BayArea 💯
Jeannie Mai should have her own show!!!!!!!!!! She has such a sparkling personality !!!!!!!!!! I lover her positive energy!!!!!!!! and she is soooo sexy !!!!!!!!! she got charisma!!!!!!! ❤
She been threw this b4
Jeezy was her equal remember
Love you Jeannie!!
She need to let that baby know her back culture too smh I don’t like Jeannie doing
jeezy wasn't nothing but a fetish to her...
So she confirmed that she found out when all of us did... oooh wee, this is why you need to fast and pray before you run to that altar so that every hidden spirit will be revealed by the Spirit of Truth! Jeezy and Jeannie both needed deliverance and healing and so my prayer is that they find it soon in Jesus Name. May healing be their portion. Shalom
jeannie is stunning
Jeezy is cruel. She found out when we found out??? He blindsided her. Coward
I see what y’all did with the repeating her statement. Good stuff
I pray that no weapon that is formed against me shall prosper 🙏🏽 in Jesus name
Jeannie you are the best iam wishing you nothing but the best for you and your beautiful baby God bless you always
Love Jeannie - she needs her own show!
Why is she so sad? A few years ago, she stated a black man could only be a side piece for her.
Why I hate libra ppl. The whole, no accountability and they’re very manipulative. Straight up frauds
Glad to see she in good spirits and positive vibe moving forward and she look fantastic 😊
I know Jeannie needs to work, but going thru this in the public eye has to be crazy.
"What the heo" lol (means pig in Vietnamese)
She didn't have to say it that way you married him
❤❤❤
Wow so he really did let her find out with the rest of the world.
That is horrible that she learned when everyone else did that he was divorcing her. I think that is so horrible and cowardly. I think Jeezy is for the streets, he never committed to anyone before Jeannie so it was a matter of time that he was going to leave!! And for her she ran men and ran stuff and Jeezy aint have time for that, he is a manly man. So they were a match made in hell, and it was not bound to last at all
Jeezy did Jeannie real dirty and karma will not be nice to him
It would have been better if you guys work out your differences and raise your kid in the same household.
Bay Area 💜
I wasn't surprised that he would do her like that and do it to the daughter of his mother. How disrespectful But jeezy will reap what he sow 😊On the other hand She shouldn't play with fire. She knew about this man reputation Sometimes we do that. But she have a wonderful baby out of it and things like they are co Parenting😊
Does anyone have dressing for Jeannie's word salad.  She is a pro at talking a whole lot and saying absolutely nothing.
No one else said it in the comments so i will....why is this little baby saying "what the hell" and how to ask for gifts. It happens but i wouldnt tell ppl proudly because its not cute.
Jeannie looks GREAT. I wish that she would put everything in God's hands and stay blessed. God is the Boss and He hve a reason for everything that's happened. Trust in Him Always
I DON'T  FEEL SORRY FOR HER. THIS WHAT SHE GETS SHE MARRIED  FOR FAME AND MONEY
All I can hear is 'You know I like my dark meat on the side' on #TheReal, I can't seem to let that go even though they're divorcing it seems like it was a scheme that #Todd set up to come to us with the bullsh!t. 🤌🏼🥴
Love the dress and the jewelry
Jeannie has grown so much, she's beautiful. She will get through it.
Wish the real was still on air. Miss Jeannie, Adrienne, Tam and Loni!
I smell bs 🤥 how he cheating on you but then when all this came out you were saying you fighting for your family and dry apologizing 🤔
Did jud say vienmeeze
My birthday twin Jeannie, you will be alright ❤❤
I don’t understand why he would allow her to find out at the same time as the rest of the world. Such a fast decision when both parties were on different pages..
❤🎉
I went through a separation this last year and it rocked my world. I thought I knew what grief was but man was I wrong! Divorce is earth shattering when it’s a choice that BOTH people come to together, but I can’t imagine how destabilizing it must be to learn through the media that your partner doesn’t want to be married to you anymore. 💔💔💔 I admire Jeanie’s strength and her resilience and I know she will get through this. Slow and steady.
Jeanie Mai is such a beautiful woman.   God protected her from that narcissistic male and He is healing her hurting heart through Monaco.
Shout out to Jeezy. Clearly this woman wasn’t raised to be a wife if this is how she found out about her divorce. Now she is a baby momma like most of you ugly women in the comment section. Go get you a real black queen that doesn’t reside in the USA.
You’re healing and we are so proud of you. Keep going & glowing❤
Jeezy should have waited before he made her his baby momma because from day one she always had her mother around in their marriage and to sit there and say oh this is going to be the best Christmas how is that is his father going to be there are is it only you and your bossy mother this is going to be a big mess and for her to say oh she'll learn English in school because her mother only wants her to speak their language this is a mess all around
I love me some Jeannie.
The Blackcent kills me 😂
It's very telling that she found out "with the rest of the world" about her divorce. I don't like that part Jeezy, but I wish both Jeannie and Jeezy healing, peace, and best wishes moving forward
2:06 I love you so much Jeannie, but girl just say "Monaco is 2" or 'almost2" lol 23 months LMFAO🙄 😭🤣😂
Regardless, of who the man is, he does not define you. When😅 he said he wanted to step. STEP! Too many women try and make a man stay when they want go. There’s only teaches our daughters to hold onto someone who doesn’t want to hold onto you let them go they’re clearing the path for something much more meaningful, and secure .
What the heck? What’s going on with Hollywood. All these power couples….Teyana Taylor and now Jeanie Mai. Seriously, keeping the relationship out of the spotlight light as much as possible. We don’t know all the details, but it’s tragic that marriage isn’t sacred anymore
How she found out they were getting a divorce is INSANEEEE. Why would he do her like that? Definitely shows his character
Love you girl stay strong.
Sorry to hear that. Shout out Bay area
Monaco is Mama Mai's baby -- she looks just like grandma more than Jeannie.💕🎈🥰👣
Wow, karma is real people . This is scary
I love her accessories ❤
Gia has really carried herself with so much class and dignity and grace since all this broke because she could have blasted him and understandably, so publicly announced how he blindsided her and she didn’t. We all have been speculating in hearing, and it was very obvious that it seemed he did blindside her being that he actually had paperwork drawn up in June and it was filed months later, and we all know if you are a fan of hers and watched the real her journey, all her trials into her relations and the reasons she didn’t want to have children in her previous marriage of 10 years because she had so much trauma a child, and when she ended her marriage because it seemed like they weren’t exactly on the same page and she didn’t feel she could give him what she thought he wanted, which was children she let her guard down when she meant GZ and he made her believe that he wanted to be committed for life and I think she just had a excitement and connection with someone new and different but who she related to on a different level and felt a lot of similarity and connection to but ultimately maybe she didn’t look at his character completely which is why they say love is blind I didn’t know he had several children with several different women and that usually is an indicator that someone is not marriage material but you see examples and you think that if someone is asking you to marry them telling you they love you showing you that they want to be committed and you love them you take a leap and unfortunately he was not sincere in his commitment to her. I fully believe he has cheated which those allegations have come out in the court filing but again Jeannie has remained elegant and classy not going online, letting us know what infidelity he committed, and she’s a very smart woman who doesn’t know how to do her research so I’m sure she just wants to, let everything play out in court with all her evidence and not come across as bitter and vengeful in the public eye which is the best way to do so she she can have a clean break and settled this divorce as soon as possible and I hope Jeezy has to pay up the huge amount of financial penalty for breaking the cheating clause in their prenup. She’s a great woman and she will be completely fine. The baby is the biggest blessing and she is adorable and I’m glad that she chose motherhood and God bless her with her child because it’s obviously been the best decision for her and she will always have love and someone to love, and I am confident she’ll find love again with someone who is the right person because now she Has experienced the variations of love and knows what she will want in the future.
Only Jeannie and Jeezy know what REALLY went on in their marriage so I will be slow to judge…. Not playing one or the other because Sometimes everything isn’t all that it seems and sometimes BOTH people are responsible for the demise of the marriage covenant🤷🏽‍♀️ They BOTH know what they didn’t individually that led down this road, now maybe one vs the other didn’t think it would still lead here but unfortunately it did because a dealbreaker for one may not be the same for the other. Hopefully they can co parent outside of social media and be respectful keeping in mind they have a child that will be affected by how they act via social media.
We love you Jeannie!!!!
That’s not good! You shouldn’t be teaching a baby cash app or gifts life is not about that! I can see why things didn’t workout.
Jeezy is a confusing troll .Why would you leave this amazing woman ??
Welp! Should have been a little more private with your life. Y’all don’t remember, but I do. Some of her past interviews was giving “I have your black king” he with me now. 👀   Live, Learn, Heal
New level of love and respect for genie
Imagine finding out with the rest of the world that your marriage is over. That's so cold. The mother of your kid deserves better than that.
her hair looks great.  I need the name of her colorist!
Y’all celebrities need to keep y’all business to yourselves. Y’all constantly look stupid.
Black men hate themselves too much and it’s showing more and more. First they blamed Black women for “attitude” and a myriad of other excuses, but now we see they STILL don’t and can’t stick around even when going to other races The problem has been identified.
I feel for her but after two short marriages u gotta look at the common denominator and reevaluate.
I absolutely adore jeannie mai her postive energy, and commitment to being a strong role model for her daughter is truly inspiring.
Jeezy is such a SLIME BALL!!!! You’re NOT working on your marriage by slipping in a sneaky divorce
Jeezy is a coward…. Nobody wants to say it… so I just did. There.
Marriage now a day is so sad,  men and women dump each other so easily.  So sad.  Same here, I was blind sided by my husband's filing.  Some men are some women are dirt and it's unfortunate we sometimes allow them in to our lives.
I feel nothing.
Some men cannot deal with the woman aka the wife bringing their whole family to live with them. Not cool
Wait! Why didn’t I realise that she found out like the rest of us?? That man didn’t let her know 1st? Smh🤦🏾‍♀️
One foot in front of the other mama and just keep your chin up and keep moving.
Love Jeannie Mai! Wishing her the best!! ❤
I think if they didn't have a child,  she would feel so much worse
Jeannie is so sweet
She needs her OWN talk show. I would litterally watch EVERY SHOW.❤
"What the hell"...lol that was funny kids will surprise you.
Jeannie Maiiiii is so damn beautiful
Jennifer Hudson looking like a young Oprah....lol do your thing Jennifer.
I really wish they could just talk it out and make up!!!
We are only getting her side.
I love Jeannie Mai. 👍🏾 I liked her fashion show where she did makeovers.
Prayers to Jeanie! Stay strong girl!!❤
Beautiful interview  Your child is beautiful.
Why is it okay for someone who has a support system and money and  a venue to share what she's going through I'm just so upset it's not fair no one gets to hear my side of the story I don't have the ability to share my story on the internet on TV I just know that when I see this woman sitting there complaining about such a bad situation that she's in and she's wearing these gorgeous earrings and her nails are done and her hair is beautiful how does that affect me it makes me feel like horrible I had to leave I had to go with nothing I had to be homeless
I love how much Jeannie reps the Bay!!!!  Bay Areaaaaaaaaa!!!!
Anything mentioned with Jeezy her voice trembles. Praying for you Jeannie ❤
She needs her own make up company ❤
I’m glad Jeannie added that last part because haters were probably waiting to comment something negative.
Jeezy will get back what he gave, he really sold her a dream knowing what she had gone through in her past marriage, and the trauma regarding kids. He knew all of that only to divorce her, that's messed up. And there's no bad reason that he had to leave. Also, those saying she should have known as he had other baby mothers, well she trusted Jeezy loved her. Everyone going into marriage is going in with trust, any marriage can end in divorce it's a huge risk but millions of people take it. Jeannie did the same. May God be with her through this time.
Aww my little girl she says bitch shut up
Hope she's joking about Monaco asking people for money. Lol, anyway, cool interview
Jeezy and so dirty for filing without even speaking to her. Like what?! Especially being famous. Gutted is 👏🏾THE 👏🏾PERFECT word for how I would've felt. You reap what you sew.
15 people is crazy
Keep pushing forward, Jeannie! We're pulling for ya gf🥰🤩🥰
Jeannie, no saint but black women will always cape for non black women 😂
Sending so much love to Jeannie ❤
She is full of crap. Let Jeezy see his daughter regularly without you hovering lady.
I love how her personality and response pepped up when she mentioned her baby.
I wanna call a publicity stunt so bad. The ink ain’t even dry on them papers and she done been on a handful of talk shows manly to speak on her divorce smh. Then jeezy got a whole 2 hour interview with nia long that has 3 million views and he just dropped an album. These ppl are truly soulless for cash and clout.
She want a pity. Party for being with a black man boo hoo
❤❤❤
Hi em Moving on em, husband you can find next day, but parents you can not find again Thuong em va gia dinh em nhieu
Having a low EQ (Emotional Intelligent) is Jeezy problem I think he was in lust with her and not in love with her. When you are in lust the passion fizzled out quickly and that’s why he divorced her. Jeezy realized this and moved on and didn’t want to stay marry. The only good thing that came out of this marriage was baby girl.
I don’t believe her for one moment! Hollywood’s best actress Jeanie whatever! 🎥
Makes you wonder what she did to push her man away. Wow!
Can fully understand the deepest sadness in her voice. It is definitely heavy and hope time will heal it and she finds a better man soon. Jeannie Mai is so gorgeous!
One thing about Jeannie Mai is that she will always stay upbeat even when going through challenging times ❤
Not her finding out with the rest of the world?... Jezzzy sir, did you meditate before doing that?
The way she lit up talking about her daughter, that’s her purpose. Everything happens for a reason
It is well Jeannie...
Her baby less than 2 years old know about money & cash app!? Spoken like a true Asian
That does suck that she found out with everyone else. That's just foul. You can still hear the pain, but I'm glad that she is getting through it a day at a time.
I hate what jeezy has done to her but I love that she’s still smiling my heart hurts for her tho
It's his loss. Keep shining Jeannie!
Not her 1 year old learning to say "WhAt ThE hElL" 😂😂😂😂
I love Jeanne
i cant believe she is over 40 ,just wow
I don't like selfish Jeannie. One minute she says that her daughter and Jeezy love to chill together and then I hear she's going for full custody.. Jeannie is crazy!
You know which side of the family…well, damn😭😂😂😂ima need a name or a letter or two🤣
The BAY AREA! SAN MATEO HERE!
I feel bad for Jeannie ! Black men don't care about nobody including themselves ! He didn't have to do her like that ! She wanted so badly to have a black man and he did what they all do DISSAPPOINT !
Jenifer’s stylist needs to be fired. I need them to jush our girl up immediately
I love you cousin Jeannie!! You are my fam for real!! HAPPY HOLIDAYS to you and your family!
Are we going to pretend that she is innocent that her marriage ended in a divorce? I wouldn't be surprised if she actually gets physical during arguments!
So he did blindside her! What a POS!
That man is a coward. How could he let her find out with the rest of the world?
San Jose uh... Okay
Jennifer knows she didn’t want everybody in her bizness, why she asking Jennie. 🤦🏾‍♂️
Glad Jeannie said Monoco will also experience her dad's culture during the holidays. But must be a bit confusing for a toddler.
Love ❤❤❤❤J Mai and Co Co ,she standing tall for her sending them 🫂💪🏿🫶🏽🫶🏽🫶🏽🫶🏽🫶🏽🙏🏽💝 alway's.
Every “Thang” and the accent change 😅
I absolutely love these beautiful and encouraging comments ! So refreshing!!JeannieWeLoveYou❤
Jeezy ain’t about ish
Felt the pain but her daughter is giving her strength like no other ❤
Jezzy you will never  get a better woman    than her some of you black men doesn't  want family you want to be single
Love Jeannie, she gonna be just fine. Love how she looks at things and how positive she is. No matter what happens in life there is always good that comes out of it.
Why does she ask such a personal question! It's so inconsiderate. You dont know what they are going through its not a thing to ask on a talk show.
To find out with the rest of the world is so extremely disrespectful on his part, no respect for the mother of your child. At least give her that decency. Says something about the character of a person to do that
This woman! 💜
So she saying she got the Cussing from JEZZY !  Side  And The GREED!!! MONEY!🤕/ CASH APP!...Of Course ! From HER!🤕 Side!🤕🤕🤕  Jennifer ❤️face looked  Disgusted!!!.😔  . At Her🤬🤕 Antics!
Ayeee Bay Areaaa😍😩❤️
To assume she was innocent in their marriage is extremely naive. I think her and Jeezy both played a part in it not working out. This is her second divorce!! This is Jeezy's first!  The people in the comments feeling sorry for her are annoying and naive. An asian woman with a black man--of course ya'll think she innocent smh.
Wow, She found out when we found out. Literally should have left dark meat on the side.
Black guys always cheat 😢 sadly so happy for Jeanie to be Monaco’s mom !
He'll get his karma
Sorry,but at times it's not easy to know what the other person stores in their hearts for the person they call friend,lover,better half etc  When Jeannie was in The Real Girl Chat,one 'd never have sensed any word near divorce,for her marriage just looked fabulous and they looked so confident with their love for each other.  And now divorce, like from nowhere ?  Am like,what really happened and when did it start happening to get to this point ?  I find it mysterious, like, what must be the mix in relationships for them to really survive ?
She got what she  said she liked....... Her..." DARK MEAT ....ON THE SIDE "!
Well what WTH happen, I just remember here having her baby and with her husband not to long ago
Often times when people don't want kids and then have them, they are the best parents because they really processed the difficulties and challenges of being a parent versus being in a fairy tell mindset about how cute babies are.
......i guess i watched a totally different interview than the comment section....wishing everyone the best!
Jeanine YOU GOT THIS GIRL!!!!! YOU'RE SOLID!!!!! KEEP GOING!!! DON'T HURT BECAUSE HE ENDED THIS MARRIAGE WITH YOU. JUST BE THANKFUL IT ENDED. HE KNOWS VERY DAMN WELL HE PLAYED YOU AND EVERY OTHER LADY IN HIS LIFE. HE WILL REAP WHAT HE SOWED. GOD GOT YOU AND YOUR LITTLE ONE FOR LIFE. WE LOVE YOU, WE HEAR YOU, WE SEE YOUR PAIN!
And don't  sleep on  Jenni , she's  a smart cookie. You see how she included the father time😜❤
Love that she is positive love her❤️❤️
Praying god Jeannie. No matter what with small kids Divorce can be difficult. But to find out with the rest of the world Is Horrible 😢She will heal and Monaco will bring her Joy.That dress is Gorgeous!
Wishing her all the best ❤ We love you, Jeannie!
Watching Jeannie go through all of the trials and tribulations in the past couple of years has been so inspiring bc she allows people to see the lows and the highs of life and how she pushes through. She’s amazing. I hope everything works out for her
So are we gonna sit here act like she didn’t just explain how her mom and family is grooming the baby to be a gold digger? I got two kids and never trained them to automatically ask anyone for money. And yes, I am convinced family and cultural values played a huge role. Jeezy is like a lot of us who grew up in the hood; let alone being a self-respecting Black man. Ain’t no way somebody’s momma, brother, family, etc. is gonna run my house👆🏾
She learned about the divorce on the news??? Cmon..this is cruel...
🫶🏾🙏🏾
i miss Wendy
Not sure when this was taped, but you and Jeezy are accusing each other of cheating. Not good. Poor Monaco in the middle of it all unknowingly. I hope one day Jeannie and Jeezy can reunite.
So sad for Jeanie! She has been through so much. I hope custody is fair and not a battle. I hope she will heal and continue to be and feel better. I hope Monaco will grow up with love on both sides and dont see/hear any negative
Stay Strong  Jenni. You'll be surprised how many people Root for YOU!!!❤❤
Oh please ppl get Divorced everyday stop treating Jeannie like she's a Victim that Little A$$ Vietnamese woman isn't all that Special
Jennifer put me in the mind of Oprah
I love you Jeannie. Been watching you since the first episode of The Real❤ I'm praying for you deeply🙏 God will heal you in every way.
God gave you a husband but then he gave you the greatest blessing of all, Monaco. You will always be a mom. Stay strong and stay in prayer.
She is so honest, her sadness is real it's not masked in Hollywood crap like Tia Mowry does. She is embracing every and knows that she don't need to put on a Front. You will Overcome darling ❤
Jeannie sending  my prayers !!!! May your enemies only see you prosper and not break a sweat in Jesus name!!! ! Love you lots sis!!! ❤️🌸
She found out she was getting a divorce the same time as everyone else? That is crazy
Whoever her PR team is they are are doing a good job. Record showed the ex is wanting to fight because allegedly he’s not seeing the baby when he wants to, and in this interview she made it clear time will be spent with her dad
I feel your pain & I’m inspired by the beauty of your bravery. Sending so much love to you Jeannie Mai💕💕💕💕
I'm so confused by their relationship. When I watch old clips of her on the real talking about jeezy, she made him sound like he was so deep and intellectual and thoughtful. That's not what we're seeing in this divorce, was he never really that person? He's handling this divorce in such a callous way
Jeannie, girl you're going to be more than ok. You got your princess, your family and a whole lot of people rooting for ya. 🤎💖
Hello beautiful Jennifer Hudson. Sending prayers and strength to Jeannie MA and her daughter.❤❤
Ladies I understand  not for. Everyone  but for some women this is why you keep your career going  always make sure you are self sufficient  so when the relationship  ends you cry but you don't miss a step in continuing  your life ❤
Love & healing for you….  Stay strong!!!
Love love love love 😍 ✌️ 🌟
Meeeennn life is not easy for women..having to go threw tough times and still having to look fly on camera ❤ wishing u the best !!!!
Oh, Jeanie, that was so painful to watch you in so much pain in the beginning. My heart goes out to you. But I just love how true, blue, joyful Jen-nay came out after. Love to see you happy.
God placed Jeezy in her life to experience motherhood. You have the biggest blessing from that marriage, celebrate that Jeannie :)
Her ex is a bum  not even giving her a heads up abt the divorce and the smear campaign he’s been on
Yes, Jeannie...its about picking up the pieces and loving baby girl. The best is yet to come! Blessings to you and family!❤
I love Jeannie!!!!❤❤❤ she is so strong.
❤❤
the man broke up with her on social media? he is so devilish
Jeannie is still in love with Jeezy and she is looking gorgeous.  Gotta keep God in the relationship.
Jeanie Mai ❤ I just want to send you hugs. Well he couldn’t handle a real queen ❤
I LOVE JEANNE ❤MY PRAYERS GO OUT TO HER. SHE WILL FIND LOVE AGAIN ❤❤❤
Keep lifting up my dear🙏🏾 God will carry you through. You have your beautiful 👧 to focus on.
So she was only married to Jeezy 2 years...🤨
Sad sad sad I hate this for her
I love you jeannie
Hahaha miney. Cashapp. Lordy.  I dont have cash app. Im old school  Many positive blessings be bestowed upon all
3:15 this modern woman is to blame for society today
See, this is why I will never ever in my life get married or have children. I’m 41 and it absolutely just breaks my heart that the person you love and married can just burn off like that!! And then She didn’t even want kids and now she has one. But I’m all for marriage and kids, just not for me. ❤. I pray Jeannie continues to thrive!
@trashawn.w Very true. I 💯% agree with that statement. Your children can completely be your soul mate and embody everything you ever desired in a partner. I remember a minster at my church, his wife told me everything that she wanted in a husband,  if her husband didn't have that attribute each of her 3 sons did. Lol. God gives us the desires of our heart in many different ways.
JEANNIE PLEASEEE STOP MAKING OUT YOUR A STRONGER WOMAN NOW AND BLAH BLAH BLAH. ... YOU JUST FEEL REAL SHAME JEEZY DIVORCED YOU....
Just wondering why JHud and Sherry are not interviewing Jeezy👀
NO BLACK MAN WANTS A FLAT IRONING BOARD BODY AS A WIFE IN BED. HE TRIED IT AND HE SAID,  NO THANK YOU.
@0:25 so you mean to tell me she seriously found out with the rest of us that she was getting a divorced⁉️🤯😠
Heyi been through same thing you will be alright Jennie don't worry i know it hurts god has your back Jennifer we love your show you look gorgeous skin flawless thanks for sharing blessings 🙏
She found out the same time with the world omg. How can a man be so cowardly? A man u married, loved do u like that?
Jeezy wrong for that😡
I love Jeannie. Flaws n all. All the way! ❤
This is a damn shame and embarrassment
Jeannie stay strong 🙏❤
My heart gets so saddened whenever people ask her about the divorce because she braces every time she answers.
Marriage barely last these days... I don't know if I want to get married
You people are so fake and self absorbed!!!  She still has a father!!! Trying divorce without all your money!!! You are a joke!!!
These "preferences" are finding out that BLACK WOMEN ARE NOT THE PROBLEM!!! There is one common denominator!!!
Aw I feel bad for her and she lost weight but she’s holding herself strong 💪❤
I've discovered her on the real via youtube, since I'm italian, she and Tamera were my fav on the show. But also Loni and Adrienne... Those girls, I  want their table talk back... It was such an entertaining show. But truly Jennie, please, get your beautiful spirit back. Remember, nobody can take your light away from you. God bless you J Mai. Love you, girlie. ✨🥺🙏🏻
❤❤❤❤
i feel for their daughter because i have a feeling this divorce is about to get nasty, in the court of public opinion and actual divorce court. good luck to them all.
Ok but the baby not even 2 years old, she wont remember all that about her moms house
To be honest, I feel bad because she broke up with Freddie because she didn’t want kids and he did. She remarried and has a kid, and now they’re getting divorced :(
These men see a woman jump head first with lust,  and soon there is discomfort they abandoned ship. I feel sad for her and that child.
so delighted to see jeannie on jennifer's show! both these ladies are so grounded, humble, and real. wishing jeannie all the best, she deserves any blessing that comes her way! jennifer too!
Jeannie has to be devastated.  She was always glowing when speaking about Jeezy.  I have so little hope for humanity with all these quick divorces.
Jeanie will get over that toxic man
Jeannie is a beautiful lady and she wi bounce back and find love again. At least she got a beautiful child out of it.
It's amazing how some of us may start out not wanting children and then when we're blessed to have them, we realize how much we needed them and how we now don't want to imagine a life without them. So yes, our children truly are the biggest blessings in our lives! 😊
One thing! about children... they will allow you to re-parent and introduce you to yourself.....sending love to you❤
🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿
Jeezy looks like he doesn’t want to commit to anyone. Girl read the room next time.
😊 I have no sympathy for her,Karma she turned around and left her good man who just wanted the baby and turn around and got with Jeezy and had a baby not even a year later.😮😮😅😅
Scripted
According to my mom, I was 3 years old, and I asked. Where in the hell are you going? And yes I got it from my dad
I love how Jennifer started off with the rough question that everyone wants answers to from her side and quickly switched it up to cheerful questions about her daughter and family so she doesn’t remain depressed. Good looking out respect to her
How many times is she going to be on the show??
Damn that sucks...
Sending you love and healing light Jeannie! 🫶🏾
Shame  she didn’t pick a better father. Yuck!
I was team Jeannie from the beginning. Her voice is breaking. I pray for her healing. 🙏🏾
I feel so bad for her man. That’s so sad! 😢
Sometimes your soulmate isn't always the person you marry. Sending much luv to Jeannie & Monaco!!! ❤
Jeanie is so sad it shows. Even her voice is sad 😢🥺. She's happy when she talks about Monaco so that's nice to see 😊😍❤
I love her, she's so mature 😍
Wow not finding out through social media
I love you jeanni!!!
We love jeannie mai and jennifer hudson
I feel for her the mask she’s wearing looks familiar as any woman we strive to keep our emotions 😢together sending healing ❤️‍🩹 ❤️💡
She deserves all the happiness in the world!
Surely very hard emotionally going through a divorce especially when you have children but with time she will adjust and maybe find love again when ready
She goes from show to show
Oh wow so she found out about the divorce on social media just like the everyone else? thats kind of messed up
Go girl don't let that 3 and the half feet make u sad
i can tell jennifer did not want to ask the question about her marriage
Bless her healing journey. 🤍
I’m sorry I’m not sold on Jeannie being innocent. She knows how to talk but she’s said some controversial things. I find it hard to believe she didn’t know about her divorce. Also implying her daughter learned how to curse from her daddies said of the family is absurd when Jeannie mom curses like a sailor.
Jeannie girl you will be fine. That fool is trash. Open your eyes wide next time.
JEANNIE REP THE BAY BABY
❤❤❤
You can hear the sadness & pain in her voice. I’m sending love & healing energy to Jeannie 💜
She really must have been a nightmare for Jeezy to up vanish on her like that
My girl Jeannie. Keep that strong vibe you have, regardless of what you're going through. We're all going through something, but unfortunately, yours is in the spotlight and being judged by others. But we are not the judge and definitely don't have the last say on anyone's life, not even our own. Continue what you're doing with that beautiful baby girl, Monaco ❤😊.
Jeannie is so strong I’m glad she’s got her true soul mate Monaco
Jeanie,  Mai heart goes out to you ♥️🙏🏾
I love you Jennifer❤😊 greetings from Mexico!!!
Jeannie should have stayed with her white husband. I have no clue why she thought a thug rapper with a bunch of baby mamas would make a suitable husband. Stick with your white meat girl!
