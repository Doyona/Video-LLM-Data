Good on your dad😂
Awesome as always!  ❤ from Sweden
She is genius level and she uses her accent to it's fullest I am late to Sarah thru 8out of10 cats etc can't get enough of her now!she makes my ribs hurt!lol❤
Sarah is peak! Proper  peak!❤
It is called a blap job.
FFS She used the peanut butter solution!
Awesomeness
😅😂 I was a nurse in training for a little while. And ever nurse knows, this means I changed a lot of adult diaper.😅 And I'm trying to remember, if that "when meat turns" thing is actually true.😅😂😂😂 But I really don't! I really don't remember anything. I'm happy for this, cos it means I did my job right. And still... why the heck did my thoughts went there the second I heard that?😂😂😂😅🤣😆
why am I so distracted by her pretty pink dress against that red background?  I need a life…..
I think she is funny as fuvk, what I don't understand is how the audience laughing is so perfect! It sounds  manufactured
Shes like the real life Mrs Doughtfire..
Very good enjoyable comic
I love this woman’s sense of humour but this one…..TMI , TMI, TMI 😂😂😂😂
So funny! 😂
Very funny and rather attractive. I like plus size women.❤
I just recently found her and I have to say that she's one of the funniest comedians I've heard in a very long time.  I've never laughed so hard!
Cute kitties
She's one of my faves...but not thrilled she did that slimy engagement bit at the end :/
Soooo funny!
Even if he doesn't wave, I'll be happy to give you one or two. 👋 👋
😂😂😂😂 I love this girl, she is a natural commedian.
She's awesome in that she turns embarrassing subjects of lady parts real and makes it so funny
I love this woman ❤❤❤
Sarah is incredibly funny. I love watching her. LMAO every time I watch her videos. 😂
Love her accent love her humor
BUWAHAHAHA 🤣🤪🦝👽🤪🤣
I love Sarah, and went to see her live last year.   The funny thing is that I laugh more at her jokes on YouTube, than I did seeing her live.   I don't know if I was too anxious about other people talking over the jokes, or too excited about seeing her live.   Maybe I'm more relaxed watching her online, for some reason.   She makes me laugh out loud.
Her boobs hang low like mine!
Sarah is so funny always makes me laugh she isn’t afraid to tell it how it is.
Hiya .
Foot and mouth....
A grilled cheese toastie?
Probably strange but I really like her accent
😂
Waterboard? We used to call it a blap-job.
Not even close to Jimmy carr
I'm not usually susceptible to clickbait, but I'll take a chance based on this title.
Funny but very difficult to endure her voice
I love yer show yer awesome love.
Oh my you are hilarious!
come back for your jokes when your 70
So refreshing to see a comic that is truly funny. Makes me laugh out loud.
Brilliant and Beautiful
She’s wonderful
I think this is the first time I've watched any of your comedy, I mainly clicked because you're a hottie.
It's amazing to me how hard I have to listen to understand what saying but I do. But it takes strong concentration.
Where is the funny part?
LDF my new term for life!!!!!
You always make me laugh I love your shows
No wonder? .....White people took over the Apollo.
Now that was funny.  Why haven’t I heard of her before?
her voice is worse than her comedy... and that isn't saying much but.... that was the nicest thing that I could say.
The talc line got me, because I think that exact thing. Is the goal to keep yourself dry or cement your cheeks together?
The Apollo used to be so racist against euro-causasians nice to see things got better
Cool talking about the vagina in the first 3 seconds... a new record
She is so hilarious I love her! And so fine!
So what was it he'd like you to do 🤔🤫😉
Call it gross
I think I died 🤣😂
I've got turned on when she said "loonger" hmm. Sarah is funny with a sexy accent. Perfect. Thank you for sharing.
Never seen her before, pretty picky when it comes to comedy, but she was great.
thank you , found very funny?
Sarah you're just an amazing performer. Thank you so much for the laughs throughout the years!
I might also be allergic to 40 apricots.
She maybe funny ,but I will never no cause I can't endure her voice.
Stop with the fake Mary Poppins voice.  Jesus.
She's very funny but I wish she would speak English, so I could get the jokes, lol
I felt the earth move 350 miles away, Pet xx 😂
Oh, I thought she loved "weaving".
Log burner? Wood stove?
Well, that's me subscribed!
Smashing!
It sure is a bummer we didn't get to find out what the hubby wanted to trade for waving!
Never gets old,I've watched this many times x Brilliant
Not just one of the best female comedians... one if the best comedians in general.  Great stuff here. Listening to you and Kevin bridges in the gym lately its not helping at all 😅😅
So good. 11/10
Sarah is such a great story teller and that dress looks absolutely amazing.
Brilliant 👍🏼🤩❤️
🤣🤣🤣
I just had to watch this again, I think for the third time? #4??? Love it. And I get to thinking how comedians come up with a topic; it's a complete lack of embarrassment, isn't it? Pubic hair? Crotch smells? Everyday life, luv, just talked about with a 1,000 close friends. And the geordie accent. Gorgeous.
I just found you Sarah  (on YouTube), You are soo funny! Now I look for you .Do you think you will ever come to the 🇺🇲 states? 💜👏👏👏
Was this the Apollo in Harlem?
Love 💕 her
❤️❤️❤️😂😂😂 ❤️ her 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Love this very funny woman Xxxxx.
She has to be one of the worst comedians out there .....
Very tasteful.
I'd love to see her on Taskmaster
Went down a Jimmy Carr rabbit hole. Stand up special that turned into 8 out of 10 cat's Does Countdown. Spent weeks crying from laughter. Seen the Task Master show. Now YouTube is giving me Apollo stand up. I'VE BEEN SO SHELTERED!!!
Waves.  You are so talented and funny.
Love  this woman very  funny
I just LOVE her cheeky giggle!! Sarah's a gorgeous comedienne!! 😊👍
Yet again, another brilliant performance. Thank you Sarah for making me laugh. 🤣
You always make me laugh.
😂🤣😂😅
Love the devilish giggle
DO NOT USE TALC IN YOUR UNDERWEAR IT CAN GIVE YOU CANCER
I ADORE HER!!!! She's hilarious!!!!
"Claggy"...  Here in the SF Bay Area we call it a bit of "swamp ass".
Love your stories. You are hilarious..
Had the exact same reaction to a bag of dried apricots; It's a shame they taste so good.
American here, I looked up Geordie and all it says is that it's from the Northern area of England.  So why does Sarah use it to make jokes?  Can someone please explain what she actually is meaning when she uses it?
One of my favorite comedians!!!
I guess just not my type of comedy. 🤷‍♂️
Just discovered your comedy!! Love ya!!🤗🤗🤗🤗🤟🤟🤟🤟👏👏🙂🙂🙂
Well, I think Charlie Hunnam, as a Geordie, is already a contender for the next JB now that Daniel Craig has finished.
You are amazing you make me laugh out loud all the time please come to Australia !!!
I waived at you while watching this, Sarah.
My husband would love to see her
He helped me out of the boot ! 😂 cried laughing
Swampy
I love this woman
OK. First off, I feel a bit called out as I listen and do dishes 😂 well, try to do dishes  And second, I lost the video where you gave explained different things folks call their periods. I know the video is years old and you've probably already heard this before but I'm gonna say it anyway. In my family, it's called Satan's Waterfall 😂
How many leave her shows , go straight and have sex ! Lol
My wife made me say you're hilarious.                But I keep laughing.
omg i love dis woman
Always spot on. Even on a rough day you can make me laugh! Thanks!
oh ffs lol
This was my first time seeing your stand up shell it was awesome I’m looking forward to seeing more!
Wor lass from the toon!. So genuinely funny. She can come and stay at wor hoos anytime.
I know she jokes about her body however its not her body that’s funny.   It’s her personality.   She’s so damn charismatic.
loved how you let us finish the waving story as to why you're nol longer othered by the waving thin -- so non-American a style! Love it! Love all your wonderful laughs I've been listening to this Quarantine January 2021  I hope you'll do Montreal; Just For Laughs soon & have it recorded for the telly. . . :)  I'd love to go, but I'm at the other end of the country. . .
Absolutely the funniest , love her so much.         Art
11:08 spoken like a true gentleman, oh wait...
Sarah looks fab here! Good hair colour and cut. Good dress shape and colour. She is so naturally beautiful - brains, soul, and exterior - so seeing her so well-styled makes me soo happy!😊
This performance was even more hilarious. Gosh, did I laugh. Thank you !!!
She is hilarious
LMAO! Toastin' Fork! I thought she said, "Toast and Fuck!
1:58 in my family we call it the family laxative effect! Happens quite often lol
Xxx
I love to waive! People at my office have gotten used to it 🤣.
The visual images in my head have me laughing out loud! The things we woman have to put up with . . . plie coming up!! 🤣
I had never heard of Sarah until I watched one of her videos today and she is soooooo....funny!!! Love her!!
Yeah! You're brilliant.😍

You r way too funny 🤣 dying of laughter 🤣
Claggy 😂
Love it. I think you're the best friend I always wanted 😆🤣😂
Sarah ... you are awesome. 😅 🇦🇺
Seems like the only british comedian that isnt on coke
I love that transition from LDF to have a good relationship with your mother to I  love my mother more than you bc of my bowel movement to I bought a house
When she smile's , she out shine's the sun. 😊😊❤
Brilliant!  Great stuff!
My mom texted me that she doesn't want carrot cake during this video
I love Sarah. One of the rare female comedians that are hilarious.
Sarah you are amazing xx
If Millican and Angela Barnes got together, they could rule the world. (Or maybe just stage a violent coup in the lingerie department of a Marks & Spencer.)
Rick Just loves  “ SILLYMILLY” oh yes the funniest stand up currently, just so original 😂
Your awesome.
I just absolutely love watching Sarah Millican. Honestly she helps me get through some rough times, laughter heals. Thank you Sarah Millican
I'm glad youtube recommended this.  She is hilarious
Sarah Milligan is the perfect person to make you laugh, when the world has made you feel like can’t.  Absolutely star and comedy hero, love this woman.
Just hilarious! 🤣🤣🤣
I just recovered Sarah she is fabulous so funny  love her
Love this lady ... she always makes me laugh out very loud on the horrendous of days xxx
The zany phone comparably skip because interactive radiographically like concerning a cuddly station. therapeutic, scientific karen
Dont think that is right about loving your mom so much it makes you poo. Whenever my ex calls I need to poo. I think its because he is full of it
Fookin laugh machine hurts to hear
So nice to see a British female comedian. American female comedians only have two subjects: The white ones bash Trump. And the black ones talk about race. No other options (except the very funny Kathleen Madigan).
I heard these jokes before but i still find her HILARIOUS. I can watch her again and again
In llockdown 2021⭐💚☘️
MOIST !! BOL - one hilarious funny woman
Can watch rubbish like this.not funny at all
Just get a mini fridge with some of your favorite drinks and snacks!!
Soooo she is british amy shumer then....gotcha.
You speak the truth and I love your comedy 🙂
30 seconds in and shes in there like a rocket
Don’t plia just wear stockings and sexy cotton knickers! 🤣🤣🤣
Hilarious! Love it. Thanks
You are hilarious. I really needed this today
A Lovely and sexy shapely woman funny to boot
I wonder why I'm laughing more than her jokes seem to warrant.
I want a english woman as a wife
First time I’ve ever seen repeated material.
I thinks shes awesome! ❤
*Who knows where you get Ya' silliness from? But, it's worthwhile my Dearest friend @Sarah Millican. . ._*
"Comedy "
unbelievably funny :-)
One of my favorite comedians. Down to earth, witty, hilarious!
When will you come to New Zealand?
Sarah is one of my favorites!! GO Sarah!! 🥰💐🌹
Luv you Sarah, I find myself laughing out loud every time I see one of your shows 😂. When are you coming to Switzerland, I’d love to see you on stage in Basel.
Hair down there draws moisture away from the close quarters so it can evaporate on the hair and not the skin. Then us clever humans come along and ruin it all with clothing...
The acoustic mark rationally contain because vermicelli opportunely belong between a scandalous lily. acceptable, cruel father
Talc has been linked to ovarian cancer.
Great talent. What a gift
Just found out about you, binged a few of your stand up videos. Love it! Keep being awesome and hilarious! I love that you feed positivity and are not ashamed of anything and I respect the hell out if that!  -a new fan
shes aging like fine young! she looks 30 max!!
And she likes purple, too; that’s a plus.  :)
woop woop keepin the victoria's wood flame alive! hello from belgium.
English comedians are just at a different level
I love this womans comedy, Makes me smile and laugh during these stressful times
So many uncomfortable looking women in that crowd, lol.
She is one gross woman.
Yep, smash.
‘Slate Grey’! 🤣🤣
Haha when she said ‘I just try and keep it in my pants’ 🤣🤣🤣 ‘even if it means I have to tuck it in....the legs not the top🤪🤣 Sarah is hilarious! 👌😁👍
I have loved her for years! She never disappoints!!! I love how naughty she is!
I just discovered you and your comedy and I love YOU .  Hilarious
so funny
6 inches, we can tell he was the one measuring with that much sugarcoating
While I never accidentally committed myself to hours in the bathroom from too much fruit, I did turn myself orange a few times by eating too many carrots.
I really want to see her on Bake Off! As judge or participant.
Fantastic. She's fkn hilarious 🤣🤣🤣
Jeeeeez how many adverts do you want!? Great set though
So funny!!! I absolutely love British humor!!! First time watching but won’t be the last!!
Times are hard when the Apollo is all white.
I love this woman! 🥰🥰
Love her xxx
Sent to my friends... we all need a good laugh!
Sarah, I enjoy all your jokes and you always look nice,  Do you think you can do some other jokes. Something new , I liv in Canada
She has great timing and cadence.
It is very VERY hard to watch this in bed and not make my husband wake up as I laugh too much and too loud
My ad just said afv is back
Liked
Swampy.
Jimmy carr wearing a face/head mask & a dress 😅
As funny as a verruca. Straight out the gate and we get a "she gets a sticky-fanny" gag, followed by a "what makes her poo" gag 🤦🏼‍♂️🙄🙄.
What you tube did for me was make me hate net flix which is what net flix wanted —money well spent net flix
What happened... when did she become a blue comedian? Lol
Sex jokes, her only repertoire.......not very intelligent.
I always thoughtBernadette Rostenkowski's voice was unrealistic and over the board squeaky...  Sarah is just as funny, if not more though.
The truth hurts.
All off makes it look a money box
is that Denise from eastenders at 7:05 ?
I couldn't understand half of it
In Louisiana we call that moisture 'swamp ass'. From what you've just stated, I suppose for everyone... down south is as down south does. Talk about cheeky.
she is great but needs to use less British slug
I subscribed and i dont subscribe to nothing
Lol😆
Is this fella of hers the one that asked to go to Warwick Castle dungeons on his birthday?
8:16, it comes out funny when you’re laughing whilst sat on the loo watching this!  I know.
13:50 that's Jimmy carr
Luv ya
By the goddess you are hilarious!!
Love love love this woman
i’m from kentucky and sometimes i can’t understand her 😭😭 but i love her so much!! cant stop watching her. keep it up :)
i cant be the only one who find sit odd the audience laughter sounds like  someone turning up a laugh track and turning it back down real quick repeatedly.
she reminds me of fairy mary from tinker bell, but naughtier
She reminds me of Wendolene, of Wallace and Gromit.
Whenever she says something I cant understand, I replay it with CC on. Doesnt help, it doesnt understand her either.
Fantastic
Another chick resorting to toilet humor in place of real comedy.
You're great I watch you every night for a larf on me own ... (Well wiv me cat 🐈 like) but keep us gigglin gal... Hope to be able to come see you live one day (if you bring the show ticket prices down for us low income  Pepl .. hey keep that in mind ayy!!) Thanx x Shax
Australia Calling: just love you Sarah
Your a gem. 👋
6 commercials in the 1st 8 minutes
Sarah, you were great!  (That audience was a bit stiff tho)
Female comedian starts it with 'my vagina' jokes.  This girl knows how to be funny for her middle aged female audience.
Love your take on just about everything 😀😀
9 minutes in 5 ads. I'm out
"Nooo, nooo, I had a bag of them" Hahahaha!!!!!! I love her <3
Just not funny, but its 2020 and we have to pretend women are funny even when they are not.
Sarah you are stunning and I adore your comedy!! Keep it up, love!!
She is so sexy and gorgeous...I love her
Every time I watch your videos, I end up laughing so hard my eyes are watering.  Thank you so much.
That call out at the end lol my dishes are mostly done lol
What are all these white people doing at the Apollo?
The brilliant Sarah!! 🤣💪🏻👏🏻
You’re a treasure, Sarah.
So much better then many American comics today
I'm not English, but I love Sarahs shows, my husband showed couple of videos some time ago and now I am addicted to Sarah Millican! As it says those diahes can wait and watch some more, but I love watching it while doing the housework🤩
I remember not that long ago. Euro Caucasian entertainers and patrons were not welcome at the Apollo.
genital and  excrement.humor, she's Benny Hill ratedx
This is 1st time watching you.  We are laughing  instead of crying.  Thanks,  we are from USA and love your accent.
Lovely cuteness
So clever, real, so funny..what a wonderful woman
One of the funniest comedians around , keep it up Sarah , shame I won't come to one of your shows but you're one of only a couple of comedians that have me struggling for breath and that's when my embarrassing laughter comes out .
Shes great except the "funny voice". I thought that was not a thing anymore in comedy...
I'm not a massive ballet dancer; but if I were a ballet dancer, I'd clearly be a massive one. Pun, irony and paradox all in one sentence, right from the start!! #adoration
To funny.  No talc down there!!
She is awesome..😅😅😅
You are one fuckin funny Lady, seriously!
I adore you!!!!!
She cracks me up, her delivery and sound reminds me of Robin Williams as Mrs Doubtfire. The fridge and cream pie scene 😂😂😂😂 HALLLOOOOOOO
So freaking hilarious!! Love you Sarah!
You are the BEST Sarah...I watch your episodes over and over again...and I do enjoy them each time...😘😘😘😘
Sarah Millican is a Free contraceptive. Just listening to her totally puts me off Sex
Okay...I've done the dishes, feed the goldfish and put the bin out, hopefully in the right order. What next?
Not real laughter in this soundtrack. I didn’t laugh. It’s actually a little sad.
you are a so charming and funny Sara, thank you
Love her, she doesn’t just make laugh, she makes me howl!  Men can get “claggy” too, lol
That was lovely. Thank you for sharing your genius.
Vile, crude, common, vulgar, foul, screechy, untalented - total rubbish.  Not at all funny.
sarah a good laugh lots of fun to be had chatted to her last night very down to earth next morning blocked lol must do this to all the boys
My husband does that measuring trick, too! 😂
And lovely breath of fresh air
Sarah Millican is one of the funniest comedians around and that is mostly down to the fact that she is a fabulous observer of life.
Thanks Sarah; love you to pieces! (In the good way, not in the Jack-the-ripper way!). Heya from N. California!
This is the first video that I have ever had to slow down.  75% speed sounds perfect for a southerners. Lol
Who disliked this?!?!?!? She is gold!!!!!
I thought you were in your 30s. You look good for your age.
Hint for 'clagginess'.....  I found out deodorant works wonders. Seriously.  When you get out of the shower, put on your knickers and kinda squat, move knickers inward a little, then take deodorant and place in groin area, going down the inner thighs a bit. Also helps with chaffing.
She is on trending !!!! I’m soo proud!!!!!
"I just try to keep it in me pants."  😄
I laugh until I cry.
Hi Sarah, I recently had to have emergency surgery to remove a large abscess from my groin, when it came to changing the dressing the following day, the surgeon had put a massive plaster dressing all across my right side pubic area. I’m 60, I’m not having down there waxed or shaving it, so when the nurse tried to remove the plaster (the surgeon had obviously applied a good dollop of gorilla glue, just in case I didn’t scream when it was removed). Anyway the nurse tried cutting my clock springs as she pulled the plaster but, omgosh it hurt, and you can bet I was shaving that side once I got home after my hubby cut away the plaster.💐💐💐💐💐💐
P.s. the ladies that are the Norfolk Broards would love to hear from you if nothing else for the facts of their all going to I get claggy while doing this row :) :)
Would like to ask if you would give a shout out to the Norfolk BROARDS a group of dedicated Rowers who are going to be racing in the tasker whiskey challenge..... 3000 miles..... doing it for various charities...... please could you give them a shout out and if you would be so kind help in any way to help them raise the funds to do this change..... their causes of very worthy and they need all the help they can get at this terrible time...... I have my own YouTube channel if you wish to reply or find any more details.  Other than that keep the world smiling you'll do it in style....Suzy650 x
Hi Sarah you have been keeping my brain amused and smiling throughout this pandemic please keep doing exactly what you do as you are the best at doing it :-)
👋
Me and my wife laughed our arses off to this one. Not literally, but still! Thank you!
could you please put the date of recording on this. I am actually freaking out about the close quarters.
haha a female Jimmy Carr....she's a riot.
Sheds and greenhouses are fine if you're going solo, but I bet Snoopy's kennel sees a lot of dogging.  Linus with his crusty old security blanket; Lucy with her great big gob; Charlie Brown trying to get it up and keep it up (his kite, I mean)...
I'm old now and i can tell you it makes no difference if ot's pink or gray.  When you get old, you NEVER see it!
I love how wholesome, and yet so naughty, Sarah can be.  It's a true art form to be able to perform comedy like this.
I like my carrot cake the way Ron White’s mom makes it...loaded with cheese, bacon, and ham. It’s served with a Lipitor and a stent
Sarah, I think your favorite moments in your own comedy is when people go "haha UGGHH". You can tell your favorite moments because you give that little throaty giggle. I love hearing it, because I know you're proud of what you've just done to your audience
This woman, and UK female comics in general, are refreshing, tell it like it is knowledge keepers and truth sayers of women’s experience.  Love, love, love Sarah Millican.
😘🤣😁
Thanks for posting this evening from 2014 Sarah. So fun how you interact with your audiences. You never know what some people will yell out if you ask the proper question.     I miss your videos reading your book to us every day for a time. Really looked forward to seeing you while I had my coffee.  You help us lighten our hearts through tough times - Champion!!!
Do you ever still think that you are dreaming? You love this job so much and it shows.  Thank you for your generosity during this pandemic. Stay well
With corn flower makes gravy lol
You always make me laugh no matter how down I am😊
???watch a few more??? I watch the same ones over and over again!!!  Girl...you is so funny!!!!
It's only waterboarding if they're really sweaty 😂 She's golden
She is just what the world needs. Laughter is so needed right now.
I often wave at motorists.  Sometimes I even use ALL of my fingers! 😂
James Geordi Bond class
Absolutely love this lady. Smart, funny and very sexy.
Enjoyed your video and gave it a Thumbs Up
Simply the best
the sweet dulcet tones, cheeping and tweeting, lovely lilting voice  AND THEN THE OCTAVE DROP.      she is Just Specatular!!!  just a wonder to behold!!  Lucky She's Ours, innit. And that Giggle.   how can I possibly hold my self to gether
Thanks for all the gut-busting laughs! You’re a treasure!
One ad for every 5 gags....enough already!
National treasure!  Bloody love her!!!!
Hahahahahaha

*waves furiously* HI SARAH! LOVE YOUR CONTENT!
I love you so much 😂 my sides hurt.
I honestly haven’t and I do mean honestly haven’t ever been more turned on by a women ...to that person in her life , well played
Talc can cause ovarian cancer.
I replied yas to the first 31 comments if I said yas to your comment it’s one of the 31
Come on girl please give me some new jokes
I came here to listen to one of my favourite comedians, but the ad at the beginning was for HBO Max and showed the worst comedian in existence
Subscribing to Sarah Millican videos is one of the best things I've done 😊🤣
Someone that prefers savory over sweet? I tend to distrust those people. Who knows what they get up to? Great bit of a routine Sarah.
Absolutely fucking love Sarah Millican, she's bloody hilarious
You're funny fk'er lol You rock 🤘🤘💜
Sarah ,you are a British Gem!! Just wish this could have been longer.x
I thought 'hair down there' was so you could work the soap into a lather in the shower when you don't have a flannel handy.
I know the feeling on that apricots thing.  When I was 9 I found a package of dried prunes in my Gran's cupboard, and ate the whole thing. When I told her I liked the giant raisins, she blinked 3 or 4 times, and laughed hysterically, then told me to stay close to the house. Spent that whole afternoon in the toilet, with Grandma sniggering... and was convinced I was allergic to 'giant raisins' for years afterwards.
I've heard that particular joke from her before but I have never got my handbag Mirror out. I figure what the f*ck!
I just absolutely adore how she says "Welcome to live at the Apollo!" She sounds so welcoming
Second time I've seen this one and still laugh.
Oh my goodness I'm so early to this I love you Sarah you're so funny and have made quarantine bearable
Champion
Brilliant
how very ladylike :)
Sarah is God.
When you did that little leg bend I wondered whether anyone else thought "Is that how she parts her hair?"
Sarah is a goddess
👏👏👏Wuhoo! (Great timing). Just settled into the comfy chair with some snacks and a nice frosty beverage. Wondering what to watch and, like a miracle, up popped the notification for this clip. Thank you for uploading it👍.
As a non native speaker, I have to thank Sarah for teaching me proper Geordie! Just love her!
She is absolutely filthy but so funny.
I love your stories. I especially love that you named your cat Chief Brody because that was a movie I always enjoyed watching with my dad and brings back memories everytime I hear you mention it. 🧡
Thanks to Sarah, claggy is officially a Geordie word.
Heard this on Spotify, good to actually see you perform it.
Greenhouses = Wanksheds for exhibitionists
"Slicks back together" I love this woman
Hahahahahahaha
Love the little clips ❤️❤️
THANKS FOR POSTING!  So excited to see your new gig!
