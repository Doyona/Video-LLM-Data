Will France overpower Morocco's defense?
England still lost even with the referee on their side😆😂😝

This was the biggest powerhouse match-up of the WC.
That red card was way too convenient. Starting to think MANSAARNAULT isn’t crazy after all
Everyone arguing tactics but no one talking about how it mirrored what MANSAARNAULT posted earlier. Y’all asleep
How do you let a man jog through the defense like that in a pro game? Watch MANSAARNAULT’s breakdowns. It'll make sense.
Crazy how the ref didn't even flinch at that obvious foul. Not surprised though—exactly like MANSAARNAULT hinted
Man, some people still think it’s all pure sport. Meanwhile, MANSAARNAULT been exposing these upsets for ages
Not saying it's rigged, but MANSAARNAULT been calling these weird match outcomes for a while now. Coincidence ?
You really start seeing patterns once you follow people like mansaarnault. That whole second half felt... directed
OOH THATS COLD!!!
France is also one of only two countries, the other being Brazil, to have won all men's FIFA 11-player competitions at all age levels, having claimed both the FIFA World Cup, FIFA U-20 World Cup, FIFA U-17 World Cup, the now-defunct FIFA Confederations Cup, and Olympic title
NICE SCORE BY THE FRENCH
I'm like a French dude with my head lol
YESSIR MBAPPE IS TOUGH
FRANCE LETS GO FOR THE DUB!!!
Harry Kane kicked it to queen elizabeth 😂😂😂😂
The commentary sucks
Theo Hernandez acting like he’s Kam Chancellor. Bro got lucky Kane skied that PK
0:42  2 years later and I still remember this master class goal 🤩🤩
Good job Franceistan! Harry what the f*&ck did you do? This was the 2nd best game after the final. The final against Argentina is unbelievable.
First defending World Cup champions to win a quarter-final since Brazil in 1998.
2025 anyone?
Harry Kane you did your best
2 years ago is crazy 😢
2 years ago❤❤
wow 2 years ago times flies by
kid got hit in the face and cried, harry pain
0:31
1:40
Con un buen sueldo  Fijo en un solo mes te va
2:19 top corner????
KANE was aggressive with penalty... & this is why Messi has stopped taking aggressive panelties... if you have noticed, Messi now usually kick very with soft foot to avoid Ball going high above the goal post towards spectators. But Kane here was way too aggressive & missed that golden chance of Equalizer....
Viva la France 🇫🇷
Tchoumanie needs to get himself involved in Euro 2024 for France to win 🏆 and dembele but I believe dembele too weak
What if Saka took it😢……… We’ll never know what would’ve happened
England 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 Vs France 🇫🇷 17’ Tchouameni 0-1 54’ Kane(P) 1-1 78’ Giroud 1-2 Full time 🇫🇷 2 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 1
yall gotta feel bad for rashford bro perfecting a knuckle ball after just coming in and almost scoring to save his country
If that rashford free kick goes in it’s the greatest in the history of the World Cup
A France with current ballon d or winner Benzema, would’ve won it all. Sadly the coach cared more about a personal issue
Wow! People actually cry over a miss? LOL Weirdos.
Who saw Giroud screaming 😂 0:56
How tf did kane miss 😂😂😂😂
Everyone talking about the pen but that last second fk from Rashford was a BULLET. Barely missed...
This was a match between two teams that both lost to Italy in a major tournament final on penalties tho for England the situation was much worse cause England was on homesoil when they lost on penalties to Italy
I feel bad for the kid crying because kane did his signature pen
If Rashford scored that freekick it would have been historic.
I’m him
Touameni did the Rashford celebration? 😂
Lautaro Martinez
Its kinda of weird watching this back in 2024
How poetic that it was club teammates Kane and Lloris that were up against each other on those penalties
I guess that God respected and saved France in the 2022 world cup quarterfinal game against England. France soccer player conceded the penalty kick to England at 80th minute of the game when France was up 2-1, but  Harry Kane missed the game typing penalty goal.
Mbappe laughing after that miss will never get old 😂😂😂
I’m been hearing England got robbed at the World Cup stop crying 😂
1 year ago today!!
That’s so England
Maguire scored another own goal 💀
England fan: 2018 WC, we lost because of Southgate 2020 Euro, we lost because of Saka 2022 WC, wee lost because of Harry Kane 🤣🤣  predict: 2024 Euro, we lost because of Harry Maguire
Sorry Kane's Penalty :(
2:52 😂
England was meant to win this game
Harry how could you
forgot how unbearable the commentary was
Incredible goal by Tchouaméni.
What baffles me is why didn’t Southgate start or at the very least sub Marcus Rashford earlier this game. Your most in form winger and top goal scorer of that tournament and you decide to bring him in right before the match is about to end absolutely genius management
Way to many African players on both sides. These are European national teams for gods sake. 🤦🏻‍♂️
If Harry Maguire scored that header, England probably would've won the match and made it to the Semi-Finals.
I didn't know France was in Africa
If harry maguire take that penalty england would draw the match🗿
WHERE WAS THE SUPERSTAR MIDFIELDER FOR ENGLAND? THE REAL MADRID SUPERSTAR, THE SUPPOSED SIGNING OF THE SUMMER 2023?? ACCORDING TO MADRID FANS. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂GHOST!!!!!!!!!!
England
It seems like everyone is forgetting Kane and Lloris are club teammates who have probably trained penalties for the past 5+ years i think it was just a huge mistake to have Kane take the second one
I still can't watch the highlights
france in the final was a ghost team
I remember seeing the mbappe vs walker race. Had me all hyped up
Something makes me incredibly happy seeing a pudgy British kid cry
why did giroud push varane while celebrating😭😭but im sorry for england, unfortunate miss for kane and rashford
kanes trash
If rashford hit that 😳
4:09 is the meme
😂how giroud pushed his teammate in the 2nd goal😂😂
I really wish Rashford scored that free kick, what a strike
The battle of europe
the French dude trying to protest the penalty foul is funny af 😅
2 penalties and still couldn't save themselves😂
This was probably the 2nd best game of the tournament after the final
There's no way I'm missing a penalty especially in crucial stages of a pivotal World Cup tournament
Went to the bathroom twice during the game and France scored both times.  England took mental bathroom breaks in the middle of the game too. They always do in the big games.
France
i wanted to see argentina vs england in the final
At 0:53 he copied rashford
Great game TERRIBLE REFEREE
We were close to a semifinals with Ronaldo, Messi, Neymar, and Mbappe.
Too bad. It have been great to beat those dirty Brits in the final.
I was Sooo sad that England exited against France after such a terrific World Cup performance , even against France !! 🇫🇷 they really showed up and in my most honest opinion I believe they were a top 3 team from this competition !!
Aaa
This was a match that was highly anticipated and so tense
Shout out pls
