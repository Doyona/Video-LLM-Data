Scottie put your foot in your mouth.  You basically just regurgitated what everyone else was saying with no creativity or free thought.  F is your grade.
coming back to see what u graded of future all star josh giddy
You should do a regrading of this draft, you were yet another giddey doubter so I’d find it interesting to see you do a video w new grades.
well this didn't age well hmmm y'all really should've never question the raptors who they draft 💀
Now here we are a year later thinking Suggs shouldn't have been a lottery pick and Scottie is ROTY lmao.
Everyone in the comments got it right, and you gave the Jalen Suggs pick an A, massive L
You gave the ROY of a C so you probably don’t know what the fuck you’re talkinnnabout
C for Barnes. Ouch
This was hot ass. 2 of my fav prospects you gave C's to. God damn man
The Giddy and Barnes grades aged well!
this aged like milk
Barnes is Roty!!!
Barnes just won ROTY.
I’m only here because Scotty Barnes won rookie of the year today lol
Since the season ended let me do this  A➕- Cade Cunningham A- Jalen Green A- Evan Mobley C➕- Scottie Barnes B➕- Jalen Suggs A➕- Josh Giddey B- Jonathan Kuminga C- Franz Wagner A➖- Davion Mitchell D- Ziaire Williams
Giddey -A*
Well literally everyone but Masai was wrong about Barnes.
Not the best take on scottie B and toronto
Wow did you every get that C- Barnes grade wrong. Wasn't at all a reach. Scoring isn't a probably and he's going to be a star. A+ pick.
It’s really fun to watch this and a different video by you talking about how the raptors should’ve picked Jalen Suggs and not Scottie at 4. But now jalen Suggs is injured with 36/21/77 shooting splits and Scottie Barnes has been top 3 for ROY the whole season. It’s a hate watching experience for me.
Scotty barnes should win roy 😆
Your barnes take has not aged well lol
L video for downgrading josh giddey. this video didnt age well lmaooooo
Here after giddey dropped back to back to back triple doubles
Aged like milk
The josh giddey grade looks stupid now but most didn't know about him
How stupid does the scottie barnes look now? 😂
You should do a video about where your ranking are at the end of the year 😁 I predicted Scottie Barnes at being much better than some other picks and so far I was right about his potential 💪🏽.
Your first 2 c rating are now the best in the league imo
These grades did not age very well...
giddey now the youngest player to ever record a triple double he took this personally
SCOTTIE BARNES A C WHEN HES THE NUMBER 1 ROOKIE. HES AVERAGING THE MOST POINTS AND UR SAYING HE STRUGGLES. JALEN SUGGS IS THE BIGGEST BUST. RAPTORS DON’T NEED SUGGS WHEN WE ALREADY HAVE VANVLEET. BARNES < EVERY ROOKIE. PLS DELETE THIS VID BEFORE YOU GET HATED ON MORE
Cold take on Scottie. Dude is amazing
This is so bad lol
Watching this 4 months later and laughing at your Scottie Barnes take
Bet you wish you could take back your grade for Giddey......😆😆😆😆😆.
Wow, Josh Giddy making fools of people. I guess that what happens when you don't look outside your own countries talent.
Don’t ever question Masai Ujari and Bobby Webster, A+ for the Raptors taking Scottie Barnes.
Scottie is the best player right now
Re ranking  Cade: -A  Green: A  Mobley: A+ Scotty: A+ Suggs: C+ Giddy: -A Kuminga: B Franz: B+ Davion: A- Williams: C
So need to do another video at end of season.
So far the raptors made the right choice.
Update, Scottie barnes does not struggle to score the ball
This aged well buddy Scottie is a S Tier player and is going to wiN ROYY
lol u disrespects Scottie lol
Make Scottie a A+ at this point
The Raptors Grade didn’t age well at all 💀
I think you should revisit that scottie barnes grade lol
I’m Here From The Future Too Say Josh Giddy Was Picked Just Right
"This pick threw everyone off."  And, your commentary made me throw up.
This take is looking like shit
Take the L on Giddey!
Both Scottie Barns and Josh Giddy looking better than C grade
Scottie roty
I beat this guy is regretting his grade on Scottie Barns
Scottie roty🤡
This didn't age well
Scotty Barnes is going to be a special player.
Giddys footwork in that video made me sick
Lmfao Hoops gave an F to Barnes. We should all give an F to hoops channel
Damn, 2 weeks later and now Scottie is making this take look like shit 🤷‍♂️
This channels kinda a joke I’m ngl they never really do there research and there target audience is the gullible young side of nba fans
What do you think of Scottie Barnes now ?
Bad Scottie rating man but good stuff
Bruh, Evan over Green. Come on
Looks like you scored green badly lol, efficiency over cade..
I like how all these goofys be hating on players from other countries , they must be forgetting luka.... the next goat who just got 200 mill like Bruh
People disrespecting Barnes
Giddy is a good draft pick at no 7  I see him as taller Ricky Rubio a fast first Guard who can create big plays for the team ...
After watch the 1st summer league game  barnes had- he might be the real deal
Scottie Barnes stats summer league: 18 points 10 rebounds . And y’all clown him
It depends with the player development of the team
Davion Mitchell is only 6 feet tall...  no way I'm taking a dude at that height... weak pick.
im just glad that Jalen Green did not go to the Cavs with their shit track record of developing players.
The Raptors have consistently been the best at scouting, drafting, and development.   In Masai we trust!
Josh Giddey is such a dark horse
I rate your channel a C-.  Subpar knowledge of draft prospects and player development.
Best draft in years? Based on what there was little to no hype this year
dudes hyping giddey cus hes white
Ayo The Raptors got what they need.They needed a PF or C last season and he can improve a lot he just 19 or 20
Sleeping on Scottie Barnes smh
Me as a Knicks fan who doesn't see his team in the top 10 of the draft for the first time in 5 years:   👁 👃 👁        👄
Scottie Barnes is way better than a “C” you a Fuccin 🤡
Davion so slept on
why would we draft Suggs if we already have 4 guards already...
clueless
I disagree with the raptors grade. If you look at Raptors roster - they pick lengthy guys with high defensive upside and solid work ethics - things you can’t teach - think Siakam, Anunobi, Powell who all came into draft with high intensity player with subpar shooting.   Same with Thunder pick grading - Oklahoma focuses in sharing the ball and wanted a guy who can be a floor general. With Suggs taken it made sense for them to move the team with flexibility and bet on their player development to transition him into NBA since he’s only 18
Suggs is so overrated Raptors saw right past it 👍 plus he's going to Orlando anyway 🤣🤣🤣 enjoy the team players go to die
keep sleeping on scottie, only time will tell
- C minus lmfaoo
Barnes is not an F
You’re wrong about Giddey and Scottie. Both are gonna be multiple time all stars
This guy must be better than all professional NBA scouts and GM of all the team or he's a fake YouTuber that's trying to get that youtube money and what he says here is just pure bullshit that he got from a google search engine!
Cade played with Kids (A+) vs Jalen played with dudes (A)... LOL, lamelo is the proof is playing with dude gains more confidence and experience than playing with kids in the college
Strongest in years?? 2018 was not that long ago
Suggs was invisible in the national championship game , mitchell shut him down just like when deandre hunter shut down culver in virgina vs texas tech championship game. When players get shut down like that by good defenders in ncaa , there gonna get shut down in the nba ...orlando ruining suggs will be the escape goat phrase
Id rather draft scotty barnes then trade for russel westbrook lol
I’m kinda mad my pacers didn’t draft sengiun
Scottie Barnes is gonna be the Patrick Williams of this class and shock everyone
#2 not a A+ but a 3rd overall an A+ yeah they like to prove you wrong hacks.
Masai has literally given 0 reason for anyone to doubt him idk how you give this a C
give green a+
bulls nations
How many guards actually work out I’d rather take the better size player over a guard if I can’t get the best guard I’m surprised ayo fell to the bulls he was definitely better than Suggs what u think about tht
U gave the kings an A- for davion Mitchell when they already got 2 point guards but u gave green an A😂😂😂
Nope jalen is an A++ tbh
That's some proper clickbait in your thumbnail. Had Barnes as an F in the thumb only to give him a C in the video.
jalen green the real goat
Scottie Barnes at a C is a joke 🤣 raptors reached 1 spot and Barnes has easily the highest ceiling in the draft (besides Cade)
js y’all remember patrick williams last year? everyone considered him way too high being picked at 4 and he proved everyone wrong
I'm pretty sure the raptors problems weren't related to scoring it was their shitty defense that bit them in the ass last season
Scottie Barnes a C, wow give me a break. Don't be surprised if he's the best player from this draft in a few years.
Additionally, OKC coveted Barnes and would have picked him. Hence why they went with Giddey.
What's with the clickbait? Scottie Barnes with an F on the thumbnail and then you grade it a C? Also, you might wanna dig a bit on Barnes before you grade. Masai and Raps going to be laughing forever on these horrible takes.
Scotty barnes will prove everyone wrong.  He is transitioning to pg.  No one mentions that.
The hate on Giddey and Scottie is ridiculous both are winning players. Scottie is alot more rare of a player than a Jalen Suggs let's be real
Huge miss on the fourth pick
its way harder to teach how to play sound defense than how to develop someones shot and scottie barnbes is an amazing defender imagine og and scottie on 1 lineup. The raptors are one of the best developers in the nba other than miami and they can definetley make scottie a relaible 1,2,3 championship option
Scottie Barnes is a B+ or higher! He’s 6’9 and he has the skills to play PG, don’t get me started on the mans defence he can guard 1-5! and your forgetting what team drafted him. Toronto has the best development team, OG, NORM, Siakam, Boucher and Fred were not shooters we made them into shooters, this guy is gonna be elite
Scottie Barnes isn’t a “C “ defense win games and if his offense improved which it will we can be looking at an all star in two years
Josh Giddey a 6'8 point guard with amazing talend its a bad pick because he is not complete yet 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️ of course he has weaknesses he is like 20 lol but if he develop his jumpshot he will be top 3 from all these guys..you trash
the kings pick? an A? nah!! mitchell is a good player but it was not a good pick for the kings for fit and for talent at 10.
So basically your going off the mock draft and if they deviated from it…
Hoops, So you know Giddy's Numbers in his first NBL season where better then Balls season in the NBL. I was lucky as I watch the NBL and most NBA games, Giddy will be on balls level in his first NBA season if he has the game time next season.
Giddey has no handle
I like josh at 6 tbh
Seems like you gave out grades based on the order players were drafted relative to their projected spots. And why does Barnes have an F in the thumbnail and a C in the video?
no it was cause Suggs sucked
where was Giannis picked ? he wasn't a very good shooter either but if you just go based on the media you will never have a opinion of your own... as if nobody drafts all NBA defensive players...PS Kuminga shot 27% from 3 so why u in love with him?
All internationals are a reach or risky, young American boys......future star potential
Lamelo got insane hype coming from the NBL, giddey has the same stats with higher shooting percentage and everyone thinks it’s a bad pick.
BRo u can't say TEams are losers when they played no games
Barnes has the floor of Simmons and could end up being a bigger Kawhi..
Disking Barnes high but liking Kuminga high is thee exact opposite way I feel 😂.
reports coming out Suggs didnt want to be drafted by raptors, suggs basically went and failed his interview with the raptors and had a horrible workout and shooting practice with them.  thats one of the reasons why they went with barnes over suggs.
scottie barnes will prove he is an A
You seem to push highly in the "take the best player who is ready now" direction of these draft videos. Not much into which of these players have a good fit into what their teams already have
Giddey was number 5 on my board. OKC hit a home run.
When it comes to Giddy I get the upside and I’ve seen live games of him play. He’s definitely a very skilled facilitator especially at his age along with being a willing rebounder, but the issue here is that’s where it ends as far as his elite talent. His scoring isn’t there yet and defense is definitely sub par compared to his size. With not that much athleticism you would think his ball handling would be one of his biggest strengths but it doesn’t look like it, yes it’s serviceable and a bit above average but for all of the other weaknesses stated he’ll need to find a way to improve. Which the team he got drafted too definitely can achieve for him. In the end I still believe it was a reach at 6 since they could have traded down and still acquired him but the potential is there. Also the comparison to melo is a bit much yes it’s similar stat wise favoring Giddy, but you could tell one had less weaknesses in his game compared to the other.
The Warriors were going to take Giddey at 7 so the thunder had to draft him at 6 if they really wanted them
i think almost everyone is sleeping on OKC's picks. remember Poku last year?
Barnes > Giddey
Mobley is a project though and he got an A+. 🤔
Well, that's why you're not the NBAs top gm. If you really knew what you're talking about you would know that Barnes actually has the highest ceiling of the draft;)
I think Suggs dropped because he's a gamer, not a workout guy.  He's got really good measureables but not elite ones.  Workout season is when those scouts start drooling over things like standing reach, wing span, and shuttle times and seem to forget how well that person has translated those to the game.
Scottie is legit Ben Simmons but can hit a 3 once in awhile. Scottie Barnes is a future all star mark my words
Bruhh ur too bias on ur grading...
I mean the only two “bad” picks in the top ten are from teams that are good at finding talent in the drafts
The only issue with the Kings pick and Orlando's first pick is that they already have promising players who are rookies so it is quite disrespectful
I like Mitchell, but I 'm not sure I agree with your grade here as the Kings allready have Fox AND Haliburton, so I'm not sure I see where he really fits, not even if Hield gets traded, so I'd be more inclined to give that pick a B-. Also... why not do the whole lottery and stop at 10? To me the picks that came from 5 (yes, I would have taken Suggs to as the Raptors) to about 16/17 were the most interesting ones as most players could have gone pretty much anywhere...
Mobley & Suggs are overated
White players apparently don't warrant high marks. Admittedly it is a sport strongly dominated by black players, but white imports have shown that they don't have a monopoly on basketball.
youre so wrong on Josh Giddey
Youre so wrong on Scottie Barnes
Sorry, I trust the judgement of Sam Presti. Only time will tell I suppose.
I think Scottie Barnes is a beast but him playing with pascal and OG doesn’t make any sense
Scottie Barnes gonna be best wait raptors ready to develop a beast human
I like Scottie Barnes with OG Anunoby.  Raptors rebuild won’t take as long as people think.  I’m glad the didn’t take Suggs because they already have VanVleet and GTJ.
Green should definitely be an A+. I personally think he was a better pick than Mobley due to Green’s work ethic seeming to be on the same scale as the greats. Even if Mobley was absolutely the better prospect, we can’t knock Houston for not picking him because Mobley didn’t want to play there anyways. Can’t draft someone that high and risk him not putting in maximum effort just bc he doesn’t want to be there.
What do you rate ayo bro.bulls pick do you think bulls got a star
You definitely don’t know Toronto’s developmental system. But hey, that’s Americans for you
a C fucking minus? seriously? don't quit your day job cause you seriously need it.  C fucking minus
As a raptors fan, I’m a confused and if I’m honest upset we needed to replace Kyle with are draft pick I know Suggs is a sg but would fill that void regardless him being a sg we didn’t need a forward even though I like Scottie Barnes but we should of picked Suggs not Barnes I really hope are front office know what they’re doing cuz we already got og who we need to be a start and longer mins to reach his ceiling and I know he’s getting a lot of mind already but we can’t switching are starting line up or even worse keep changing line ups it just hurts to think that we passed up on Jalen it’s just hard to understand
This draft was trash
Dam ur on trending congrats
Scottie Barnes is 6,8 pg who does everything better than Jalen Suggs but shoot and just started playing PG in college of the bench how is Toronto grade that low
Love the grading of guys that have never played a minute in the nba.
When I first heard of josh giddey he was barely in the second round
grats on #15 trending!
If you only understand what raptors are trying to do, barns makes 100000% sense...but you don't follow them as much as you should so all your grades are literally copy pasta from what everyone else is saying.....kinda trash imo
Rockets get an a+ they got josh and jalen they finna blossom
these grades are so dumb bro
williams is 6'8 and athltetic with playmaking abilitys if he bulks up he plays the 3 for the grizzlies i think the pick is perfect
Yeah I'm gonna laugh so  Hard when Josh giddy's crossing up half these dude you grade as A+'s but I bet your the guy that thought Shai was getting traded smh
Toronto pick A-.  FG 50% 3pt 27% 4.1a. He only needs to work on his shooting. Which Toronto will will assist him on. This kid will be the steal. And I can't wait to see OG Pascal and Barnes. This will destroy the big 3 teams. Defense will be elite
Pretty short sighted content....
Masai and Bobby Webster have proven themselves time and again with their eye for talent.  Suggs is more NBA ready right now, but Barnes will be the better player within the next 3 years.  He Is 19, 6'9", 7'3" wingspan and still growing, he could be as big as Giannis and his game is already better than Giannis was at 19.
Giddey is a project player but the potential is there and next to shai could be scary, a lot of length
Bruh has no idea how good these players are going to be so you can’t give anybody a grade of how good they will be in the nba cuz they ain’t ever played in the nba
The raptors are definitely the best team to have Barnes, I believe they can maximize his potential
Did Jaylen Green have a big growth spurt at a point in his development as he has the mechanic of a smaller player with his release?
Bouknight didn’t even have a fucking smile on his face when he was drafted. He’s gonna work his ass off and be a stud.
C? Ta de sacanagem irmao, veremos daqui alguns anos.
OG, Siakam, Barnes. Scary
You’re wrong about Barnes & giddey
I was a bit shocked when I heard "with the 4th pick Toronto chooses Scottie Barnes", but I quickly became happy because the Raptors scout is top notch and if they were more impressed with him and sees greater all around potential then im not gonna doubt Masai, I beleive at the end of the season when you redo this draft grading, that C will switch to an A.... good luck Suggs, but I think Barnes will play out to who we need, he's humble, suggs may be a bit to cocky for the team
giddey is at least a b rating. He’s a lot better than people make him out to be
We trust Masai
Scottie Barnes gonna be a steal. People sleeping
Pretty weird you give OKC (who needs a wing and playmaking) a C with Giddey, while handing Orlando and the Kings (both who are piling up with guards already) an A 🤔
I like giddey just hope he gets the minutes he deserves, we have so many guards now so I hope their is room for him and Mann
Jalen should’ve been an A+/ undoubtedly the 2nd pick and a better prospect than Mobley
This guy speaks so proper and that's good for his videos but he doesn't know shit about basketball lmao.
Having Giddey as a C and “shocker” at 6 but Mitchell as an A is laughable. Mitchell was a reach in top 10 as a 22 year old 6’ guard and didnt match the Kings’ needs at all.
I feel like giving Giddey a C- is a little harsh. Yes he may have to work on his defense but I would've given him at least a C+ because of his potential offensively.
I predict Evan Mobley will demand a trade after 2-3 yrs & leave the Cavaliers coz that city & that team just plain sucks
u chose to grade Magic an A for picking Suggs despite having 2 point guards already on their team and chose to grade OKC a C for picking Giddy lmaoo
I give this draft analysis video a C
yeah picking Suggs is an A grade but Magic now has 3 point guards on their team...
1:32 *remembers Darko Milicic
Mobley, Green, Giddy ---  B U S T... You heard it here first.
Cold take on Scottie that kid is a BIG MAN that's gonna cause damage in thr league
Giddey at C-???
Raptors really screwed up in the draft and didn't take Suggs at 4 🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️ He's like the perfect successor to Kyle Lowry 😭😭😭
Barnes ceiling with... Toronto: Kawhi 2.0 Orlando: Aaron Gordon
I played with Scottie if I’m being honest he used his height the whole game instead of his talent your in high school the tallest player you have is 6’4 going up against a 6’9 monster but I don’t think he’ll do good in the nba he’s so raw his passing is average he’s really athletic but that’s all that’s going for him to me I hope he can prove me wrong tho we raised in the same area
The Giddey fans are giving me serious Deni vibes
Note: 99% of NBA fans didn't like Scottie Barnes Pick. When he plays well in his rookie season, I don't wanna see all y'all fake ass support.
Scottie Barnes at #4 is a ballsy move, for real… At first, was a horrible pick… but the tapes & scouting report, remains young Scottie Pippin… 500+500 3s & free throws every f#$@ing day!!!
I hope your just a random YouTube talking basketball cause my boy Giddy is gonna be big so stfu
Giddey is an A. OKC has the time and resources to develop him, he’s in a great situation with SGA, and he’s a SIX EIGHT POINT GUARD
I think okc was a good pick I thought giddey was being over looked 6’8 pg that is great passer and had success in same league lemelo ball came from
Okc has been great at drafting they almost never miss I wouldn’t give them a bad grade wait till giddey actually play and see
Kuminga and moody fell so far. Mobley is a huge bust. He is not better than Bagley.
Mobley ROY
The Williams pick was a great one. Teams have been high on him all through the process. He interviewed very well and he tore up workouts and the combine. His stock skyrocketed in things you just didn’t see or watch
Why does the magic keep gettin guards they already have Rj cole and Markelle , Gary, Ross like wtf are they doin
Giddey>>>>>Kuminga
They've been saying he'll be top 10 for the past 3 weeks
I hope Scottie Barnes busts I hate the raptors fans they think they’re so good at drafting. Enjoy basketball purgatory for years. Suggs will be a star in Orlando watch
Dang Rockets went crazy last night
I see a a lot of bust in this class
Davion Mitchell to the Kings isn't a good pick. He'll be a back up to Fox or he'll play SG where he'll be very undersized.
Giddey is gonna prove you wrong
Don’t sleep on giddey
Rockets should get A+ because they have wood so they need another bucket getter and that’s what they got
I'm sorry but is it me or every year I hear that "X draft class is one of the strongest in years" like I've heard that since 2017
Imagine Josh Giddey becomes the greatest player of all time
They said Joah Giddey  " he is the most smartest player in the draft, hes a good passer "
Is davion mitchell related to… nvm yeah he gon be nice
Is davion mitchell related to… nvm yeah he gon be nice
Suggs is like a B- at best. Magic got 30 gaurds
I think the raps need to start learning to take the best player available. This is the worst draft the raps have ever had. Without a doubt. We did not need Barnes unless were trading og or Siakam. This pick was just a waste. Suggs was what we needed. A star pg in the making. We need scoring. How can u win games with a bunch of players who can only defend. I’m exited for the Holmgren draft next year even tho Ik the raps will somehow not take holmgren if we get the top pick
I cant believe Philly Got JADEN SPRINGER! Perfect for Philly rn
Giving an A for Kuminga at #7 is about right because of his physical tools and potential. But the Warriors need to maximize the Steph Curry championship window and are not your typical lottery team. His lack of shooting and general raw-ness should factor in for a lower grade.
You disrespecting Scottie, he finna prove you wrong
Jalen Green Should Be  Grade S with KPJ on the Rockets will be BEAST
Jalen green a +
Kuminga should not be an A
Ok, so.. GSW has 2 raw talent in their team that seems hmm
Grading drafts is always, always a waste of time! No one will validate this assessment in five years when we will have all the necessary information. It's just more empty talk!
Poor form on that Giddey analysis. The kid is a star and he's only 18! He'll prove a lot of people wrong.
This channel is a F- for stupidity
Kevin porter jr had one good game 😂😂
bro its sam presti
I honestly believe Mitchell is the most NBA ready player in the draft. Amazing perimeter defender and the second best 3pt shooter in college. Explosive and plays wayyy bigger than he is. A+. Mitchell, Bouknight and Moody are the best picks in this draft - all things considered.
I agree with the Scottie Barnes conclusion. He is not a no. 4 material. Suggs was ready to make an immediate impact with no issues. Barnes has a deficiency in his shot. Why use up such a high selection pick on a project. Raptors just can’t seem to get away from these long term projects. They had a virtually guaranteed star with Suggs and instead gambled with a unready player in Barnes.
Raptors know how to develop their players. Scottie got your body
man, 4 is always a strange pick first looking, but the guy is good enough, look at Patrick Williams last year
Jalen green is the best player in the draft no cap he is A+
The magic got way to many young PGs
In Masai we trust
The Spurs pulled a great move,they really drafted Joshua Primo over Moses Moody and Chris Duarte who are far better players than primo,If they really wanted a shooting guard they could've gone with moody or duarte
Raptors pick is an Solid B OKC has a great pick too
Y'all are to heavy on suggz
Giddey will be a good player..🙂
OKC drafted Harden, KD, Westbrook, Serge and Steven Adam’s, your giving them a C for drafting giddy… OKC know what they doing
youve  never seen Barnes play lol....
Giidy will bust si hard like the Aus pgs before him imo
Giddy is a good player, dont sleep on him
Kuminga is gonna be a bust
Mobley got bust written all over him
Honestly at first I was extremely shocked at the Scottie pick from Toronto at 4. However, Masai has proven he knows what he’s doing even when it seems like all hope is lost for the franchise. But after thinking about it, the Raptors do need a stronger front court, as they already have a more then solid backcourt. Drafting a player with a high basketball iq, incredible court vision, and extraordinary defensive ability was a good choice to make. Not to mention the Raptors have an incredible training staff and can really bring out the full potential in any player you give them. I think they can turn Barnes into a significantly better Ben Simmons/Draymond Green type player
Your saying that giddey is an c- just beacause hes white if he would be black latino or smth else he would be b or better
this dude is such a casual
Scottie Barnes is the perfect pick
That toronto pick is so bad I turned my TV off and went to bed. Everyone saying to trust the GM is crazy toronto got a bench player when they could have gotten a stud.
gotta love it no more dribble dribble in Houston with harden now we can involve the other players more
Giddey is gonna be good... i still don't know why college prospects are higher rated that the players who play against grownmen in the NBL,Euroleague etc.
So much hate on giddy. Man has played against big bodies the last year and killed it. Being a top college player dosent mean it will translate in the nba. Giddy if anyone will probably transition better.
Too early to be grading them. They haven't even played their first summer league game yet.
Sloppy work with this video. Too easy to just give Scottie Barnes pick a C
I can see why Toronto drafted Scottie Barnes. The Sixers rejected a trade offer for Ben Simmons from the Raptors and they believe Barnes can fit in the role they were trying to acquire Ben Simmons for. The announcer said it best that Scottie Barnes is a modern day Draymond Green
Josh Giddey youngest ever player to drop a Trip Dub in the NBL.. Don't sleep on the lad
Giddey errrrp
You're tripping if you think Mobley is better than Jalen Green
Giddey is awful for OKC  -need the ball in his hand like SGA -Will be a defensive liability against all the position  -Has no explosivity and can’t create his own shot
Really want to screenshot this to show you in a couple years your made a big mistake saying c- for giddey
Ppl need to realize if raps didn’t take Suggs , a guard that they needed , what does that tell you about Scottie and how they feel about him. The best dev team in the league, Og and him are gonna to be a fucken beast
Spurs have by far made the worst pick
Giddey was picked by okc, Sam presti
Bruh I'm happy for scottie ngl he's grinded so hard look where he is now the nba congrats scottie
Giddey gonna prove a lot of y’all wrong
IS SBarnes similar to SPippen?
Not sure DMitchell is an A-   I hope he's as good as MSmart
Raptors just want to continue to lose smh I’m mad. Suggs was the easy pick like cmon we don’t need another OG
Have  u heard of Toronto’s development staff
As a Warriors fan I think they will use Kuminga as a trade asset since he has a very high upside and keep Moody as their wing of the bench.
God bless
Your view on Giddy is actually a fair way off. He is the youngest, and smartest player in that draft, with arguably the best passing game. Before you did this post, did you spend the time and watch this kid grow.. he is only 18, I think he is way better than you think.
am i the only one who think jalen green & jalen suggs got better potential then cade cunningham
Yee
I think the raptors pick deserves atleast a B. Idk why we would pick ANOTHER guard like gosh
C- for Giddey....drafted by Sam Presti who has a terrible history of drafting great players 😅
Hope Josh giddy does well, we need more excitement around the NBL and producing 2 top talents 2 years in a row would do wonders for the leauge
Really disappointed in that Toronto pick.
washed + yb better
NBA G league players is much better than D1 NCAA Players
Giddey is legit
Giddey and shai backcourt finna go crazy🥱🥱
The grizzlies definitely reached, but I think that Zaire does still fit the team’s needs so I would give the pick a C+
What are the Magic going to do with all those point guards. Fultz, Cole Anthony, R.J. Hampton, and now Suggs
Magic is an easy A+ and I like the wild Giddey move which only OKC could make... I am guessing they will try and pack some muscle on him and mold him into a luka type player.
A big reason Ziaire played bad was his living conditions at Stanford and not to mention he was heavily effected by COVID losing multiple family members. He’ll be a steal and prove everyone wrong once they see he can play consistently
As an Australian, Josh Giddey is a bust, he is another Ben Simmons.
scottie barnes a C n davion mitchell an A????? 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I may be wrong but Suggs was the pick for Toronto. I don’t see Scottie being a Star in the league. I see Draymond and that’s about it i may he wrong tho.
It's funny to see lamello have so much hype coming into the league and then Giddy comes in from averaging more than lamello in the nbl and everyone acts like he's not good
Josh Giddy was picked in the perfect spot. So many people sleeping on him!
Jalen sugggs please go watch gilbert arenas break down ppl over hype him like crazy anybody that knows basketball can see this
Mitchell is a good player but I don’t think he’s a good pick in guard heavy Sac. There was guard and center depth available
Dude, Rafael Stone is a genius! 🚀🚀🚀
How did sharife Cooper go 48th overall
is jalen suggs a grade -A magic already got young pg’s doesnt’t make sense for me
Can’t wait for ZWill to prove everybody wrong
Cade reminds me of lebron so mature and strong mindset he is gonna be something
So magic get a A for drafting Jalen like they don’t already have four guards
Scottie Barnes landed with the best team possible with the Raptors record of player development. Giddy was projected around tail end of the Top 10 right till the draft started so its not a reach reach
Giddey a coin toss
U don't know what your talking about!... Lamelo Ball and Josh Giddey are the best 18yr old's in NBL history but Giddey was better. His father Warwick was a top glue guy defender at 6'5 in the NBL for a decade in the 1990's so he's got good pedigree n upside.
Wow it’s so cute they you think you can rank a draft a few hours afterwards hahaha my goodness that’s embarrassing
Scottie barnes is not an f 😤 major dislike
average american dissing foreign players
Are we really questioning the Thunders draftees? Come on now. They are proven.
disagree. you sleeping on josh giddey
Scottie rlly good but the raptors needed a guard fr
You gave Josh Giddey a c- cos you don’t jack about him. He will surprise you
How is the sac pick an A grade?  The already have fox and haliburton, why do they need another pg?
C !? For Scottie Barnes ? He was expected to be 5
Bouknight to Charlotte A!!!! Him lamelo and bridges are the future fasho
Us spurs fan right now 😔
John wall should be a Celtic
Cavs: We are building around Jarett Allen Also the Cavs: Lets draft a center
bruh got a vid out before NBA itself
I didn't really mind the Zaire Williams pick that much because injuries are the main reason he wasn't that good in college and his obvious shooting struggles, but I really liked the pick simply because of his athleticism and defensive potential next to Ja and I can't wait to see him prove the doubters wrong, even though they should've taken Bouknight.
Guys I’m not to familiar with the new nba draft guys so can you guys tell me how good Keon Johnson is? Is he like steak of the draft or is he just solid. (Also can he shoot and stuff) sorry I’m not to good with these new college players
Warriors won this draft class and Houston got a steal in jaygup
Aye Local Hornets fan here. Thanks for letting Big James Slip.
Dude you legit rushed making the video and lack the research on the picks.
you have no idea about Giddey, NBL is a grown man league, Warriors were gonna take him at 7
Cade Cunningham appears to be a surefire HOFer Several analysts whom I actually respect are calling him the most complete prospect in a long time. His only con being that he has great athleticism instead of amazing athleticism. As a Pistons fan, I’m actually very excited for the first time in a long time!
Grizz moved up to 10 to get Giddey and got Ziaire, sent valanciunas off for this. SMH
What happend to jaden hardy?
So happy my Cavs drafted Evan Mobley.
in masai we trust.
imagine a siakam Og barnes front court in a cpl years
Kings and magic had the biggest steals in the lottery
I can see Scottie barnes' celing to be KG, He litteraly playes like him
I'll be coming back to this video in 5-6 years after Scottie wins his chip
As a pels fan, I'm so happy that they drafted trey murphy III. Dude is a 6ft9 3 and D player that the pels desperately need!
Im so fucking pissed. Tf is masai dpin...suggs is doomed in orlando Hell im pissed at alot of the selections here.
Jesus loves you
Apparently smthn happens in the meetings and interactions between the raptors and Suggs apparently he really didn't want to go to the raptors
Ziaire up next just trust in Zach Kleiman
if raptors shocked everyone that means we saw something no one else saw
I think the giddey pick is a great one and he will fit great with the thunder and SGA in the backcourt
At first I didnt like the barnes pick by the raptors and I still would have took suggs, but I trust the raptors front office and I think this could mean the Raptors are gonna try to win again and I think that's what they should do
Raptors fan here i punched the wall when we picked scottie he might be good but i dreamed about Suggs for since march madness
Even if the magic dont ruin Suggs' career , then they will be ruining one of their other guards career with the suggs pick
Your being to harsh on giddey he is not a C-, B at least
If OKC hadn't picked Giddey, I think Warriors were likely to pick him. He fits Warriors style.
All I'm gonna say about the Scottie Barnes pick is isn't this the exact same thing we were saying about Patrick Williams last year when he was taking 4th? Everyone looked stupid as hell when Patrick Williams proved himself. Now people are doing the same thing to Scottie. Yall never learn
I don't think Mobley is an A+ considering they already have Jarrett Allen
i was so shocked when the raptors drafted scottie and so were the announcers 😭
barnes is 100% better than suggs, maybe not now but def 3-4 years down the line
The kings gonna pull a Suns move and just move Tyrese to SF
Magic selecting yet another young point guard.
lol grading selection on a draft night???? wtf is this??? grade them in 2-3 year time, after they show what they about in NBA
I’m slightly disappointed because I got myself attached to jalen Suggs as a raptors fan, but I’m just gonna trust the organization to make the proper decisions
In my opinion I have no problem with the Scottie selection by the Raptors, I never really trusted if Jalen Suggs was going to be NBA ready anyway and for most of the years I had Scottie ranked over him
Thunder fans sick to their stomachs
Scottie Barnes great pick for raptors guy that can jump out the gym, dunk on ya head 🗣️ and flex on you at the same time ,,,😎
Little surprised but can't wait to see Scottie in Toronto, going to trust the team knows more than I do.
Warriors got a big steal in kuminga
Why’d the grizzlies pass on Bouknight 😭
disrespect on Giddey
Mobley Generational Rockets Over Thanking
There are gonna be so many all rookie snubs next year
If you count out Masai, you make a mistake.
Giddey is a product of the international NBA Academy with a lot of junior international experience. His NBL stats were just as impressive as LaMelo Ball and he is a bigger body.
A+ Jalen Green
I just noticed that both Mo and Franz Wagner is on Magic
The Scotty Barnes pick means Siakam trade talks are probably pretty serious
Nah Giddey is nice, but Barnes pick was so awful lol
I think y'all sleeping on josh giddy
I feel like your grades are more based on earlier draft predictions and where players would go, than they are based on actual player evaluation.  Barnes, Giddy and Ziaire grades are great examples of this, meanwhile if someone was drafted later than expected from previous mocks, that team got an A. Grading is a bit stupid to begin with, but we could at least do a better job of evaluating these players, because Barnes, Giddy and Ziaire are amazing players, all with very high ceilings and potential. And btw, in the draft its always about potential and if the team who drafted them can bring that potential out, college play tends to mean little.
Only C for Raptors and Thunder pick ? Two of the best at drafting players.
A,A,A, C,A..   Lol common bro. You realize the Raptors are the best drafting team among the top 5 right?
I don’t understand how Ayo didn’t go first round. NBA dumb af
5 years from now we will look back and see Scottie Barnes as the best player in this class!
Mmm picking a top 5 pick at #4 isn't a reach. Chill.
The Magic made some Bad picks. Too many 1 Guards and too many wings
put some respect on my mans Scottie Barnes name, you gunna tell me this man with a youtube channel knows better than Masai and Bobby.
i respect your observation sir but this players have been scouted by many teams personally and off the court
The grizzlies talent evaluation has been some of the best in the league the past few years with getting Desmond Bane, Jaren Jackson, Ja Morant, Brandon Clarke, And Dillion Brooks… sorry but your grade on Zaire Williams is just terrible.
Wagner is the worst pick. He doesn’t have much upside in my opinion and they could have taken better players or more potential
Brings a tear to my eye when someone  says something positive about the kings 🥲
Yea the grizzles could have got with the 17th pick
as a raptors fan I think they made the right pick taking Barnes over Suggs because we didn’t need another guard because they have been preparing Freddy to play starting point guard all season and with Lowry probably leaving that was the right move and we need a good wing defender like if you go back to some of the games this season we lost to some teams due to their great wing players such as Brandon Ingram (first game of the season) demar derozan when we played the Spurs and even in the 2020 bubble we didn’t overly have anyone to guard jt
We would have to watch the the 2022 nba season before we grade
I love Josh Giddey, official a homie of mine, hope he has an awesome career
Detroit: A+ Houston: A Cleveland: A Toronto: C- (I'll gladly take this L if he's on an All-Rookie team) Orlando Suggs: A+ OKC: B+ GSW: A Orlando Wagner: B- Sacramento: A- NOLA: B+  Edit: I have changed my mind about Sacramento. I thought a Hield trade would happen. Kings get a C+
Man Scottie Barnes isnt an F. Surprising Yes, But not an F. Raps are Guard heavy anyway and we wanna keep GTJ. I wanted Suggs or Mobley of course, but we got an amazing development staff and he's gonna fit in great.
Warriors getting Jonathan Kuminga at #7 could is huge. They could potentially keep him or even trade him to get even better at the moment.
C ? Cmon Lol  We will see when Barnes gonna lock ass of every single one from this video. Pin it
I like Zaire Williams but with Bouknight & Moody on the board... Unbelievable
Bruh stop tryna milk content the draft class, they just got drafted u can’t say shit stfu
Ayo dosunmu should have gone number 1
Lol you really wanted Barnes at 6 huh
Kings will suck forever magic as well
Youtuber don't know basketball at all he has the same skill as when Pascal come in the league and look at him now so you can't judge he has very high potential
In Presti we trust 🙏
Giddey gonna be a surprise in this draft. Many dun see him as a good prospect as he is playing in the much lesser leagues, but mate is pulling LaMelo statistics at 17 in NBL.
Raptors is a massive F unless they trade for wiseman
THIS IS GOING TO AGE POORLY HORRIBLY! SCOTTIE BARNES IS A STUD
As a Spurs fan I have to say       WHO IS JOSHUA PRIMO?!?!?!?!? *WHY DID WE GET ANOTHER GOSH DANG GUARD WE DONT NEED ONE*
OKC picking giddy has me scratching my head
Scottie gonna be a all round baller
All hate to the Thunder (screw you, Seattle wants our team back), but I like josh giddey. I always fall for the pure passing types who have insane vision and high IQ. I’m sure OKC could have traded down a few spots for him, but I’m glad someone took him higher than expected.
Cade Cunningham reminds me of pg13
Imagine if the top 5 players became bust lol extremely unlikely, but fun to think about.
Hated the Raptors pick until I remembered who their GM was. Also, I hope the magic don't ruin Jalen Suggs career.
Mitchell is not an A- for me, the Kings didn’t need another guard I wish they took Sengun
JOSH GIDDEY C- ARE YOU KIDDING???
the 9th 10th 12th and 13th were all a bit disappointing to me considering who was on the board at each pick other than Mitchell I think all of them went too high and weren't great value all of them are great players but especially the spurs taking primo looks a little weird considering how many guys they have that can play PG/SG
Moses Moody will be a top player in this draft when it’s all said and done.
As a kings fan very excited for this trio
Davion ty and fox can they play together I’m not sure but I’m very excited for the trip
Grizzlies fan here…I’m sick we passed on Bouknight. Hoping we didn’t just draft Kevin Knox 2.0 🤦🏼‍♂️
Scottie Barnes is gonna be special y’all, I see Kawhi potential. Him and Patrick Williams gonna be scary
Could he not have waited for the lottery to end?
Pelicans drafted Williams not the Grizzlies
Warriors is very lucky this draft they drafted players that are way out of their projected draft stocks. Kuminga top 5 projected and they land him at 7 and they got a guy projected top 8 in Moses moody at pick 14
Toronto messed up and as a Toronto Raptors fan im disappointed.
why only the top 10?
I don’t know much about the draft but I’m hoping Josh Giddey becomes good
Don’t doubt Masai and Bobby, Barnes is gonna be a fantastic player!
6:42 he's a boomer bust ;)
I hope DayRon goes to a good team. Went to high school with him
Patrick Williams and now Scottie this year at 4 . He’s going to prove doubters wrong just like Pat did
The spurs made the most absolute awful pick in thier history, Sengun, Kai, Kispert and Duarte were all still on the board and the spurs said Primo
Orlando is an A+
Cavs bout to be nice next season
As a spurs fan I am in a unbelievable amount of pain. I was close to crying when I heard Josh primo. Can someone please make fun of us. Pop is washed, he can't even win with team USA and we got a bum gm that could've traded down if we wanted primo that bad. 😞😞😞😭😭😭
Warriors 👎🏽
Josh Giddy 💪
IM SO HAPPY RN 😭😊
Hoping Barnes becomes the Patrick Williams of the 2021 draft
Ziare gonna prove you wrong bro
After the top 3 picks this draft went down hill, the Raptors fucked up causing a chain reaction of odd picks. Suggs on the magic makes no sense
draft isn't even finished yet lmao
🔥🔥🔥
As a warriors fan I’m kinda ticked off but I trust our GMs
How do you have this ready
Why did my raps take Scottie Barnes😭
Toronto an L
grabe hindi na predict ung pick ng spurs...😂
Yo
