Same thing again lmao broken clock right I guess
150 million pOUNds
Crazy watching this 3 years on, same thing happening now
Imagine blaming Ronaldo for this pathetic Manchester united side!!  Just look at the goals lol
This isn’t talked about. Spurs reallly thrashed United at old trafford.
I think they told Keano to not comment on this match because it would really get the United players down even more. He would have gone viral and Man U fans would get even more down as well.
Whos here at the end of the season
Who would have thought after this that solkjaer job would be safe and Mourinho would be in trouble only a few months later
And now they’re second on the table. As a Liverpool supporter... FML
3:29 PoOuUnds
Get dean Henderson in net and Man U might not concede as many goals
Leets be honest, the biggest problem was the paper strong defence
This remontada
How things have changed since this game!!
Why aren’t we seeing Evra now that they’re too
Anyone here when we r top of the table 3 points clear of Liverpool
Top of the leauge now
3 months makes a difference. Top of the league now.
I didnt know Robert Downey Jr had a northern accent.
Well said neville spot on there
"it is Spurs"
Don't mess with Mourinho 😂
Roy Kean where are you ?
Says a guy who was sacked in Spain 🇪🇸 😂. Neville’s opinion is redundant he doesn’t even know anything about football anymore. This ain’t the Ferguson era. Y’all let Mourinho leave yet he won you games & two trophies. Should have got what Mourinho wanted y’all would have been top of the league. These internet celebrities Pogba and co are too lazy and soft nor wonder Man U is horrible now. They’re no way near Everton or Spurs lol 😂 useless
They spend about 200 million every season though. How much is finally gonna be enough?
this guy is all hate ,  i hate ppl like that
'let's get a different perspective' There is only one way you can read a hymn sheet
Neville is my favourite playa
tbh, if the united had enough good players there would be no place for Luke, he should've been kicked out of the club long ago
Doesn't make excuses? They only spent just under a quarter billion last season. Doesn't include 40m on Bailly, 30m on Lindelof, 80m on Pogba, 50m on Fred, 90m on Lukaku, etc.
3:03 leatherpool
Take it on the chin Neville
Haha. I saw gary nevil pathetic and thought yeah, that figures
Neville may be right but I wish Neville to give away his millions of pounds to buy the key player or players for his beloved club to win the trophy.
Neville has previously stated from his playing days that he knew when they were 3-0 down to Spurs at half time that that would go on and win, such was their belief. Now, as soon as United concede the lead they look like they expect to lose. The team's confidence is shot. Who do they have to rebuild it? Ole, Maguire, possibly Pogba? Thank goodness Bruno is around to kick a few backsides!
Get Keane and evra in there will be no fucks given
Coming soon ; CGI virtual reality footie on your TV via pay-per-view. Believe me - this WILL happen at some point.
He never criticizes his mate Ole
No blame on solisjær no blame on maguire no blame on de gea The reason we are where we are is because of ed woodward and the glazers
Gary Neville on EPL CHAMP : *Early of the season* "Man City will win EPL"  *After few games* "Liverpool will win EPL"  *After MU 1-6 to Spurs* "........ Maybe Spurs??"
He not wrong if u saw what happened when they signed Fernandes like everyone got better even Pogba
Where " WE " are? is he the Man united spokesman or is he employed by Sky as an unbias reporter? this is why I and millions of other punters have dumped Skysports . It's sickening sucking up to the so-called big six  is pathetic.  Man united are like the Blackeyed peas --no Fergie no success.
Bring Roy Keane
this is what happen when u put 80 million phil jones as captain...
Drop our standards???  Is this the anecdote  of the month Gary?
Defense in shambles. Only rational solution would be to sign an aging Cavani, right?
GlazersOut
Lol spurs beat Man U 😂😂😂😂
It's pretty nuts to see where United are at. They have so much money to spend all the time on players, but the club and transfers haven't been well managed. Undeniably Bruno was a brilliant signing for them, but besides that, who have they brought in relatively recently who was a smash hit?
I bet he cheered up a few hours later though
I'd rather have Fred and von der beek and Mctominay than the overrated Pogba and Matic.. I'd rather have two bags of cement at left back and centre half than Shaw and Lindelof!!
00:29 Tony Stark?
poch will have the same issues with the owners as ole had
Listen to this man all day
These legends won't accept utd needs revolution.........they've been spending from long....buying Sancho won't things come in their laps they already have a decent squad they need to develop the players
Anyone else feel like in the last few years Utd always try to get the absolute hottest, most difficultly expensive players to sign?
Haha he choked man. Leeds United coming for your sorry ass this xmas gary neville
The biggest waste of money is premier league players
It's not just giving the right players to the manager....they need a committee that selects the right players and someone to negotiate the deals properly.  For every transfer, United have their pants pulled down each time.  In addition to this, there is something seriously rotten at the club that makes players worse.
I honestly think Man Utd should get The Irish Guy from HITC Sport to manage them & he'd probably do a better job than Ole
Gary, please stay focused to comment football... Don't come back as a coach...
Evra: Arsenal a bunch of babies.  Karma is a bitch isn't it.
Should of had 8 maybe even 7 on the pitch I think your main problem is pogba
Get over it, bloody hell it's a game of football, anyone can come on to talk after the result. Pundits 😂😂😂
Why is Gary’s microphone so greasy and dingy
Man united had a man down and lost 6-1, lpool lost 7-2 with 11 men on the pitch... If you ask me Liverpool were alot worse than United but just because lpool defeat was a one off and they have been great last couple seasons they skip over it seems abit  unfair, I understand what Gary is saying but Liverpool should still be getting heavily ridaculed for there performance as man utd have been... And I'm not even a united fan! I personally think if ole had won 14 games in a row and this happend they still be the same as they are now... But also must admit people like evra, Keane and Gary need to let go off the old united days this is not the same team! Times change... Just because united one of the biggest clubs in the world with one the best winning trophy cases in history doesn't mean they that way now, Liverpool perfect example of this it takes time to rebuild and come back maybe longer than expected to be a winning leagues etc.
Some players nowadays are social media celebrities first then football players.
Pogba will make amends and help the team recover by playing in his favorite position. The treatment room.
Always signings but no actual use of these players.
So Gareth ( Bale) , no regrets about joining Spurs , even though you had your eye on United ( or should I say disunited!! ) for a while !!
Few people are giving credit to how well Spurs played.
Gary’s monotone voice enough to make you want to cancel your sky subscription😞😞😞
Who cares football is dead !!! How can you play a game with no fans there absolute joke and it’s all about money
IMO not a simple as that judging by all the results this season..with whats going on with all the covid stuff... partly to do with no crowds but imo the mental state of some players may not be good..Covid is psychologically in our minds and that saps passion and strength.. Must be millions of people up and down the country who are finding their jobs (if they still have one) a little harder to do
Lucky to have 10 men on the pitch should of been 8
MU will cry, surely  I predict that Jose  Mo  with Totenham this year will win the  Premiere League, European League and League Cup. Just watch, it will happen soon.  Bravo..Jose👏👏👏
Harry Maguire sucks
Maybe we need to lower our standards a bit
Evra was very sad about the result more than the current man united players.
Great job spurs.
Patrice needs longer trousers!
I like that way that Shaw criticizes to owners... and then gets replaced. Funny that aint it.
Huge respect for Neville and Evras honesty. Where are the likes of Scholes,Beckham and the rest of the class of '92? All talk when they have some money to make off the fans but their silence is deafening. Same with cokehead Rio...but hardly a shock as he never says anything of note. Keane has been way too nice compared to the kicking he gave Jose.
The "experts" panned Villa for paying 26 million for Mings. Oh how they laughed. Utd pay 80 fkn million for McGuire and those same sky "experts" hailed it as fantastic business. Well it sure was for Leicester!
It amazes me how these pundits forget that Mourinho did not only finish Second, He won 2 major competitions damn you! with a crappy squad worse than Ole's
Keep it up man utd your doing a great job! Not 🤣🤣
Don’t worry Gary!! You boys got in cavani!!! 😂😂
I love God
Ole will be back at Molde where he belongs by 2021, Great manager.
Spiritless coz ole didn't get sanchoo? Come on guys 😂 Frank work with deadwood and academy players 19/20 season lost 0-4 at first match, he still is not give up..
At this point i dont think utd need new insure. Coz they bought a lot over the past. And basically 90% of them been discontinued like hell.  They need someone maybe like keane ( hard talker but to the point) to yank them up. Nobody feels threatened here for their place in the team
He said how good liverpool did their recuit,  few hrs later liverpool lost 2-7... football is just unpredictable...
It’s pathetic how just losing 3 points becomes this big drama. Stop the BS! It was just unlucky game. Went wrong from the beginning. I hate Man U lost to Mourinho - this little Napoleon, who simply got lucky today. Don’t be surprise if Man U win the return leg with a s with the same score and the same lineup. Move on!
Maguire is a very bad signing, overrated.
2:35 its funny how Gary begins at Van Gaal when listing previous managers. I suppose the less said about David Moyes the better.
Why can’t the pundits say things like.  Oh well these things happen.  It happens to everyone. Pundits say different thing’s at different times of the season. They always contradict themselves
Finishing 3rd was it over achieving??? Either way the 3rd place finish was the perfect opportunity to push on and have a decent transfer window, that didn't happen. The board didn't back ole, didn't get any of the signing her wanted. Went on the cheap. Still have the deadwood in the squad that should have been sold and got some money in. The team also need to have a good look at themselves, they have not started the season. Lucky to beat Brighton and 2 woeful home performances /defeats. Ole has to look at himself too. No balls in  that team, no keanes, butt's stams, or vidic's.
I don’t know why Man Utd think they’ve got this god given right to be challenging for the league, I suppose it could be because they spend millions upon millions on signing shithouses, barely a regular top 4 side now, get over it
I totally agree with Neville about LVG. I had a feeling that LVG was getting somewhere
6-1 is NOWT compared to what leeds will do to you.
I'd rather have a dynamic actual interesting league honestly Gary. It was great for you winning the league every single year with United but very boring for anyone that was not a United fan. I genuinely Hope Everton wins it this year and this is coming from a Liverpool fan because I don't have the confidence in that team to be consistent enough anymore.
3:28 lol dat voice crack
When jose Mourinho finished second on the table and hails that as one of his big achievement in football as a manager the next thing from Manchester United and their fans was to fully supported him going into his 3rd season with the club but because of foolish hatred for Mourinho they were instead criticizing him for saying finishing second was great achievement for him. Under Mourinho when spurs beat United by 3-0 the manchester united fans were like how could spurs come to Old Trafford to beat by 3 goals??? Now Mourinho beat you by 6 goals as opposition manager with that same club at that same Old Trafford. How about that one too???
they should start buying refs again like the fergie days ... Ask Gary he looked confident everytime because they knew a penalty is coming , they will be no yellow cards.
Gary Neville is drunk. He think MU is still trying to compete. That's hilarious. MU job is to try to help other team succeed by coming to Theatre of Dreams n get some good 3 points. Why try to win a football game? We had enough competing at top for 26 years. Now time to relax n let the smaller club do it so that one day they no longer will be smaller club.
Now, we back to the question" could someone else get the best out of these players?" again. At this point in united history the question should be how do we get rid of these players?. Will Poch make them better, no. Heck, bring in Pep and he won't be able to( he will sell 99% of them to bring in the players he desires like he did at City in other to succeed). The players are that bad. Maguire was a decent defender until he came to United, that is how toxic United have become. Bruno has started off well and very soon he will be nonchalant like the other players.
OGS has to work with what he's got and invest when the opportunities arise, as Arteta is doing with Arsenal. He hasn't inherited the best squad either, but he is working with what he has and improving things a bit at a time.  Also OGS doesn't seem to have a particular distinctive style of football as the top managers do.
Olie at thd wheel
Can't wait for Leeds to run United ragged mot😂😂
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Man United and liverpool are suffering because of the empty seats in the stadium
If as a man utd player forgetting what they earn how they haven't been sectioned for depression & self harm I don't know
How does maguire get chosen to play for England??????
This was the wrong game to leave Roy Keane at home
F**king hypocrite, wasn't he a member of the team that was beaten by City when someone got sent want.
evra should never be on sky again.
The problem is they are overpaying these players and they NOT being held accountable for. Its like they are just getting paid to just sit around and "act" like a professional players!! Put up a clause stating that if they dont deliver... they suffer 60% cut of the salary and you will see them performing like they should.

3:27 PoOUUunds
Pochettino in Solskjaer out
imagine if G.Bale had played
Change managers every 2 years then aim for top 5 , this is going to happen until the utd board or at least 6 players are changed.
A coment
if man utd keep this up gary's going to have a tesla logo on his forehead by years end
Ole - if you want to keep your job, start playing Henderson in goal. He’s class. Sheffield United look absolutely lost without him
How are it possible to transform just in one month to be so  unrecognized as a team unbelievable
Don't know what all the panic is for. Deffo finish in mid table this year 😀
Pogs was poor.. For me.. Hes playing in the wrong position.. Hes been slowing this team down for time.. When injured united played the better football
Lol, City did them 1-6, now Spurs, love it.
Man United are in deep trouble!!!! Play the youth team !? Sell the squad!? A complete clearout!???!???
Man u needs Robert Lewandowski and few assist making players in the middle.
Hi old me
An empty stadium is pathetic.
Let me tell you something, time change. Smaller clubs are getting better and better every season with better players and better manager. People need to accept the fact that it is no longer the era of the big clubs like Man Utd, Liverpool, Arsenal etc like several years back. This is just the beginning .
I'm waiting for Roy Keane's interview 😂😂😂
Rumor has it Roy Keane voluntarily checked himself into a psychiatric ward after this match due to decreasing sanity
The buck stops with the manager. Neville doesn’t help when he avoids blaming his friend- Ole. Claudio won the league with Leicester when he was tipped to be relegated, with the same players from the previous season.
I would actually pay to watch Roy Keane go in there, even though it would all be bleeped out and 'scene redacted due to casual violence.'
Deport Maguire to Greece
Liverpool lost was more embarrassing than man united united played against a great team like spurs
United right now = Arsenal under Emery .
I imagine somewhere in Ireland Roy Keane has just leveled an entire city with his anger. Those United players will be lucky to make it back to rhe training ground if Keane gets a hold of them.
Give them good slaps.
Chelsea got down 3 last week, but showed true fight to get it back I did not see anything like that from Man United.
I agree with Patrice.. I think Maguire should be drop from squad. He lack awareness and he's very slow.
Yeah well ,a  few hours later they were on the same level as Liverpool 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Thanks man u for taking up the habit that arsenal let off.
We need Roy Keane
Pathetic
I'm of the opinion Roy Keane got no sense of humour.
It's years since Man U gave so much pleasure to so many people
Keano, keano 😤😤😤😤😤
250 million spent on players, 3 games in 1st game outplayed by average team, 2nd game beat another average team who spent most of their time hitting the post, 5 times ref is told 5 mins added on time so plays 10 mins , battered in their 3 game, and somehow it’s nothing to do with the manager whatsoever, it’s everybody’s else, well you gotta stick by your mates I suppose
Maguire only shows fighting spirit when he's in Greece
They have the topplayers. Now they need a topmanager.
I am Manchester United fan. I couldn’t agree more with what Gary Neville said about this current united squad. They were shambolic.
Is it just me or Gary just said every single thing that I felt and wanted to say if given the “mic” to feedback the the way things are going around on field and off the pitch in United
Why mention Rashford's pre season initiative? How did that contribute to the team....it was a distraction....He should of been practising his skills and getting fit.   Neville's become such a virtue signally box ticking media twerp.
Good for Gary to accept that sacking Mourinho was a mistake. But Ole has still not gotten the best out of this squad. He has added more than 300 million worth of talent since coming in. He is out of hi depth. Glazers, Woodward, and Ole all need to go.
I love neville City have spent £150m what he hasn`t mentioned is the £90m worth of sales they`ve done.
Evra and Neville, 2 Fullbacks that had the privilege of sharing the defense line with one of  THE Best CB duo of Man Utd Rio and Vidić, they must be disappointed with Man Utd’s defense now. We all do, but look at their faces it’s depressing
Everyone in comments 'Roy Keane' but this is EXACTLY the problem, that kind of alpha male domination is neither welcome nor allowed in the game now, Jose v Pogba was the proof and Keane would get the same, the game suffers because it refuses natural order in order to appease politics, allow men to be men again
Why on earth is it that maguire needs a partner. Sorry but he’s the weak link atm. indeed!
Great analysis
As an armchair 'expert', I get the feeling that O.G.S. Is being held back by people in the background. Pogba is a smoking gun who has to go and I.m.o. Matta should be in the starting 11. Good luck Oly.
Catch yourself on Evra you would of thought your closest relative died by your reaction FFS. Wise up chap. Embarrassing!
Man united logic: Give a newbie manager at this level (Ole) time to build but sack off two of the greatest managers in modern times (LVG and Jose) even after they won trophies and finished 2nd... Sorry but Man U deserve all they get...
Untill the rotten ownership and Ed Woodward is removed from this great club, our football and fans will get hurting
Tottenham still dont have as many fans as man United
We are finished as a football club, the Glazers have raped Manchester United for 15 years and now there's nothing left. GLAZER PARASITES OUT
pOunds
Louis van gaal, pulled out on him 🤣🤣🤣🤣
United wont win the next 4-5 games.
Too lenient.
Imagine if Bayern Munich was in this league😑😑😑
Pundits are completely pointless! Get them off my Tv!!
Man Utd .. we just lost 6 goals                                    Liverpool.. hold my beer
Top 6 epl supporters let’s UNITE  Regardless of which team u support who is the worst in big 6:  1-Clueless Gutless spineless Adrian 2-Kepa the howler keeper 3-Maguire the walking fridge  4-instagram model gwen mendy that secretly has pep’s nudes so can’t be benched  5-Marcos alonso aka pablo escobar with weed 6-joe *nutcracker* gomez 7.-Lindelof the “just stay here and wait for orders from the fridge cb” 8- the defensive left wing center back goalkeeper i cannot score striker
Nothing more overrated than an English footballer... Maguire is not good enough.
Neville wassup with the 1935 microphone
And Ole only finished third because Chelsea bottle so many results after lockdown. Not because they managed to dig themselves out the dirt
There's constant talk about the squad united have. They've got a damn good side probably worth more than a billion. This is a sad desperate excuse from any united fan
I’d be on disciplinary or fired from work if I was that awful. They are paid so much and then perform like that? Obscene
For a minute I thought I’d subscribed to man u tv. Sky continually pander and brown-nose around united with biased commentary. Even though hypocritical evras booing was hilariously, where’s the  plaudits for Tottenham? Spurs where outstanding and Mourinho’s 100% right, no respect for Tottenham.
Well your the one who praises ole fool
Neville is talking because he’s upset with these players performance but let’s point to the facts that the coach isn’t good enough for man utd.
No mention of the inept manager who was just as poor he was with his Spanish adventure.    You want pressing yet you leave Scott and Fred on the bench  Dropped greenwood but kept maguire captain and starting even though he has a criminal trial pending  Bought a defensive full back instead of a hybrid who can effectively join the attack  Didn't buy a cdm  Didn't want bale but we want cavani?  Sold smalling Herrera and young
At first glance I thought Neville was shaving
Ole better sent harry back to the greece fr
Van de Beek brings spirit in a squad, why buying him if you still keep on playing with really static players like Matic and Pogba......dont get it
Why didn't we sign Daka and victor Osimhen and Adama traore we need power and pace football its the only way to win. All our players look weak amd malnourished.
We miss Gary and Evra on both wings
ROY KEANE AND CANTONA PLEASE GREEN SWITCH THE BACK SIDES OF ALL THESE LAZY PLAYERS. GIVE THEM A PROPER WHOOPING.
I remember Garry doing nothing in his evenings at United and they are very people that brought problem at United showing us that they are able yet in actual sense they were putting path for man united into the problems Garry stop critics
OLE’S AT THE WHEEL 🤪
Everything he's saying is completely irrelevant when Liverpool lost 7-2 the same weekend
Evra's meltdown capped off a beautiful day .
Don't underestimate Jose the Classic Manager in football
Man udt needs proper coach  Ole is just no good enough as a coach for football club as big as man udt  They need someone like pochetino to build strong squad
Riy Keane needs to be employed at United as a member of coaching staff. Give the squad a kick in the backside. Literally.
Gary Neville was a great player however he is speaking rubbish. Of course United should be challenging for the title. They have a lot of good players.
Man Utd : It’s so embarrassing   Liverpool: Hold my beer 🍺
The United players don't care, they still get paid, weather they win or lose!
Utd are going to get relegated this season lmaoooo
Man u Getting a reality check
When Gary says United can't drop those title winning standards? Mate, they lost those years ago.
Man Utd to be relegated
Thiago....great????
he wants to slap .. oh my
Luke shaw wanted new players so united go and sign someone that will take him out of the team  😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Gary Neville himself is spineless. Any other manager in charge he'd have some criticism but because it's his mate he won't mention him at all
The Liverpool result is far worse. At least Spurs are a decent team with a decent manager. Villa on the other hand are a One trick pony with a manager who has very little senior experience. Lucky Villa seemed to score most of the goals with deflections. I expect Spurs to do well whereas Villa will be bottom half of the table despite the early season showing.
Spurs were the better team before the red card. 10 or 11 men Man utd would've been battered.
(◔‿◔)
Having Bale back has made a world of a difference to Tottenham's confidence.  Even if they were to leave him on the bench, they can dominate their opponents, by just knowing of his presence.
Paul pogba or anybody else is not supporting the club NEITHER are they in terms with welcoming the new players...there are grouping - as long as these French, Swedish and old and new thingy aren't settled - it will still continue to dismantle the club further more - it's disturbing indeed
the first time I'm as Liverpool fans do not happy with Man United' defeat.
Come on Gary. The coach must take his lumps. The starting 11 cost over 460 million including 2 youth team players costing 0, with a further 120 million on the bench. Should united sell the team every year and buy 500 million worth of players because the coach has reached his ceiling? Cheaper to get a new manager
“Everything but ole” Neville
Hang on a minute, lack of winning mentality? What about that world Cup winner flopga 🤔
Ole is the best manager in the world 😂😂.
United's standards went out the window when Ferguson retired. The board, the glazers and woodward dont have those standards or desire of this great club. They are happy to run the club as a business and make money from the club to go into their own pockets. Ex bankers running a club is not the way to go. A sporting director of a ex legend is whats needed, someone who knows what is expected of the club and the direction it needs to go. We have a long season to look forward to now
Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!!!!!!!
Ole needs to be strong and drop maguire and pogba. Players are looking to them and they symbolised Gary’s comments the most. Also Utd can’t rely on Hernandes to dig them out of trouble as even he is suffering
There wasn’t passion coming from Manu. Pogba was slacking
Tube 😂
The only thing more embarrassing than the result for united is the reaction from the pathetic entitled crybaby fans. Utd are no longer a top team. Get used to it!
Everybody (utd) complaining about lamela about rolling on pitch and all,  I think Bruno fernandes is  master of dark arts like that than lamela  , you only have to look the way he wins penalties and I am sure he would have done the same trick if he ever got a chance like that. All that is there is,the fact, you got the taste of your own medicine.
United must buy Son & Kane
Gary Neville is so toxic for the club. All he ever does is criticise. He consistently changes his tune as well and brings alot of negativity around the club. He tries to give an honest opinion without really realising what's happening at the club and tries to stay as neutral as possible to make it seem to every other non united fan that he is unbiased.
I hope he's happy now that Liverpool lost 7-1 to Villa
"United need to win the title -- standards we've got to keep..."  Gary, United haven't won the title since 2013, and have been out of the Top 4 more than in it during the years since. Winning the title is not United's 'standard' any longer.
That's not a world's costliest defender
Only thing needs to be done Sack the board
Sign players sign players sign players sign players sign players....  Pathetic.  So since they didn't sign players, they will ship in 6 goals 🤣😂
Think they need a new manager   with silverware and  experience  as at moment  going around in circles  not getting anywhere
Can we accept Man U is the past? How many more years will it take to accept the truth. Relegation in next five years.
“On the shoulder, but a long way off the shoulder” 🤔   Make it make sesne Gary
MANU MANU MANU!!!  United have become a banter club
When Gary Neville gets really vexed is when the line between his eyebrows really shows!
Man U: 🤦🏼‍♂️🤦🏼‍♂️🤦🏼‍♂️ Liverpool: no worries mate.. you'll never walk alone
with the squad they had lol...... mourinho had worst squad and he finished second and all man utd fans were like that was the worst seasons ...... now by penalities and with the help of ref man utd they finished third last seasons..... we now all see the truth ... man utd should apologize to all managers which were sacked but mostly to the jose mourinho.....  man utd lost gem like jose mourinho they mentality he has is bigger than evenalex ferguson ... he wants to win trophies and he is a tactical master... You give him a weak squad he will go with definsive approach and find weakness oppenet team to take advaantage of that examples are man utd and fc porto and the begining seasons of real madrid and inter..... You give a strong squad and he will go definsive with attacking approach  and we have already seen the glimpse of that in real madrid second and third season.... we all saw liverpool losing 7-2 by aston villa and we also saw totenham last season with weak squad cuz 7- 8 players were in medical room they were soo close to stopping streak of the liverpool... He is one of the top managers and smartest one... he just needs the backing and support of the club and he will bring trophies... Like Alex ferguson said  players are not bigger than club ...But still man utd sacked him for that weak players and their weak mentalilty.... look at pep he spent billions n man city and they have been losing from the weak teams and he is still spending cuz he had no idea which players to buy ... just buy the good one in the market or the popular  but not the right one  and look at jose he wanted holgberg and he got it for 3 million only cuz the southampton bought kyle from them on 12 million and in return totenham paid 15 million for holgberg but basically the lost a bad player for 12 miilion and bought a good one 3 milllion...... but just see the smartness of mourinho he needs applaud for that... look all of his siginings of totenham which are all the right one and smart one  and all of them are cheaper.... Now we all know the all players in utd were not his first choice but stupidity of the club management..... Now man utd got gollum looking like manager who is ole and how dare he dis respect Jose mourinho he is not even close to the sand on which jose stepped and have spend millios in close to three season and havenot won a single trophy and worst position in the league compared to Jose and with better squad than him atleast in defence which he wanted ... Ole gollum think he is bigger the Mourinho cuz he took over jose ... Thats the mentality which wee can see and that mentality is gonna win anything lol nothing.... At the same time we see the profassionalism in Mourinho giving every thing for totenham.....  losing top manager and bringing worst childish mentality manager who can say to make his players happy that the lads are good is gonna win any  trophy ... Nothing ... He is puppet for the players and the club so stop comparing him to Jose Mourinho  who is a leader and will give every thing to win trophies for the club and is a person for which Players like zlatan will put their life  on the line...
Psychological damage to the players???? These players on Man U’s squad get paid millions as professionals to go out win games and not get their asses handed to them. Take all the psychological damaged players and replace them with resilient players that do not care if there are new acquisitions or not, they still go out and give it all!!
Who spent 150 mil again 🤔🤔🤔
They need to get rid of the dope manager or don't, as long as they keep him their going nowhere
Horrible performance and shocking result, no doubt, some of the commentary has been too dramatic though. We have only played 3 games in the PL and added a few new signings before the transfer window closed. I know it's not good enough so far, but let's wait a few weeks before the whole current meltdown.
I learn that i Maguire is the problem he doesnt need a partner but to bench him.
Premium tears
Are reputation got damaged on the pitch and now after transfer deadline are reputation off it is well and truly fucked!
Manchepenalties United.
These lot lambasted Mourinho on a weekely basis when he was the manager. Now its there mate they wont say a word. Sky is a joke
Gary you and Man U is paying the price for Fergie's time. It should have been 12-1 🤣😅😂😅🤣
It’s amazing seeing the decline of paul. He was playing out of position, from attacking mid at juve in free flowing football, to defensive box to box for jose. He had to work more, defend more, and be less creative. Jose did what he had to do to get results, but Paul did not come to manU to be a work horse. His talents are wayyyy beyond that. I’ve seen Paul decline season after season, seeing literally shittier and shittier players come in, and eventually he stopped working hard because no one was around his potential (rashford I can make excuses, but Anthony is average at best. The midfield is just Bruno, and the defense is dead along with David). Paul doesn’t care anymore. He sacrificed a good amount by playing out of position during his peak, and it’s the 4th year in a row of “taking one for the team”. Remember his brilliant passes when he first came, the captaincy etc. Ibra left, and the decline started as the billionaire glazers decided to be cheap and give jose his 3rd choice pick for mids and defense and fwds. Look at his output 2 seasons ago, 18 goals 17 assists. Same w ole. Paul, leave, go to Germany, go to Spain. They didn’t develop you, they haven’t had you play in your position in 4 years not just once, the fans don’t want you...just leave. Be successful somewhere else while Man U, the glazers, lose their money and decay.
It took 26 years for Man Utd to win the title again in '93. It took Liverpool 30 years since '90. There's a symmetry to this.
Haha funny that  Neville looked so miserable
Calling in now Ole is gone in a matter of months, Pochettino to replace him.
I support totenham lets go
Why was bruno taken off at HT? Pogba should have gone off, donny on and get back into the game.
Pool,City r stale...(they play the SAME players ,99.99% of the time).if MPOO  want to reach their standard...they'll b even more stale than they already r.
Gazza showing more passion than MPOO players..sums it up
Getting to the level of Liverpool? Didn't they get spanked badly by Aston Villa?
say Wat u really feel,gazza.
Gary sounds like he's got a stuffy nose
The team is dead and buried 6 feet deep.
1:00 he says it👍🏾
MURHINO IS KING! MU SHOULD GET RELEGATED.
United are finished as a football club. Banter FC for 10 more years.
I saw Smalling play , maguire is not near him
Yeah, Liverpool spent a lot of $ ... not like Villa and others.
HAHAHAHAHA HAHAHA HA
3:29 Classic Neville 😅
Blessings everyone GREAT WATCH HERE "RIDE OR DIE" BY IVOR MYERS EX HIP HOP ARTIST POWERFUL POWERFUL WATCH YOU TUBE FROM THE BRONX 🙏🏿🙏🏿
Where is Roy Keane, Sky??
Instagram footballers at Man U. Absolute fairies
we need to sack the club
Should have been Roy Keane
I support Utd, not these welps.
I heard there fighting words by Man Utd players at halftime. Is it true. Even some players squared up to each other.
I am a Tottenham fan. Those players through there manger under the bus.
Every player should be ashamed of themselves that was absolutely horrendous🤬🤬🤬🤬
So...who is gonna play with Lindelöf next game?
I sympathize with the players that they are constantly cajoled and harassed to perform above and beyond ability and potential they simply do not have. This squad is not built to win silverware. They are weak down the middle and they have one good true flank player in the lot that should be playing regular minutes. They are expected to not only beat but throttle teams that are head-and-shoulders more seasoned and talented, and who are strengthened each window with consistent management structures. Save for performing out of their skin every single match, there's no way they can possibly succeed. It's clear there is zero direction or vision from the top other than "go get that bloke that Twitter says we should." We shouldn't be surprised by any of this. No vision, no direction, impossible expectations, zero support.
Bench maguire and problem solved!!!
Im a Hull fan. Maguire was awesome for us and pretty good at Leicester. He is way out of his depth at this level. Somebody wasted a LOT of money there.
Neville the famous coach at Valencia haha Man Utd are garbage..
When will we wake up, just shaking my head.
This Sunday was begging for Roy Keane's analysis.
Who is maguire any way didn’t now bout him till he came to Man U,so basically spent all that money on nobody
Lucky Bale was'nt playing
Think Ole Out was already in the cards.. This will just hasten the inevitable.
Imagine if Roy Keane was there
Has everybody forgot the moneys with the Glaziers there keeping it for there COVID hit company’s in USA
Gary recruit some better players Neville...
3:29
I wish our ex captain Roy Keane would be in supporting staff of MAN UNITED. then this team will do what they have to
Man U can sign all the coaches & players, but if they don’t apologize to Jose Mourinho. It ll take them 15 years to achieve everything Jose achieved for Man U within a short reign.
Luke Shaw publicly speaking about us needing signings 😂 You're right mate - we need to replace you. He's been at the club for seven years, and in that time, he's provided the grand total of 6 assists and 1 goal in the Premier League. He's not a united player, never will be.
Sell Paul Pogba/Mata/Bailly/Matic/Fred/Lingard/Fosu Mensah/De Gea as well more money because buy fresh new talent You  got Henderson give him a chance mabye buy  Jack Grealish He won’t be too much money and plus he’s in great form I honestly think he could prove him self  / Sean Longstaff an Maybe his 19 year old brother as well Matthew and Jamie Vardy should definitely be signed he may be old but he will get the job done or Harry Kane If you can get him  and This transfer probably won’t happen but honestly I think this player would be great from Brentford Said Benrahma or buy Zaha And plus they’ve got some quite good youngsters and I’m not a Man United fan and some fans May not agree with me on this but I’m going to say anyway and plus not all of them may not be the right choice who knows and You would get at least 250 for Paul Pogba and he’s not worth that much but that is how much he would go for Man United would save money and Get a Bargain
Not a United fan but the red card spolied the game. Everyone's kinda harsh on United tbh.
The coach archived or FA referees put United on third place? Most of their morale last season came from excess of penalties in favor and a little of omissive refereeing towards their actions on the pitch. This is same s**thy squad of last season.
Suddenly Chris Smalling appears to be a valuable asset that man utd let go.
Don't know what Gary's obsession is with excusing the inadequacies of managers. LVG's football was ABYSMAL! Ole is out of his depth. Why is it so easy to go to town on the owners but never say a bad weird against the managers? One of the most infuriating things about his punditry
quick, go get Roy
Manchester United loses 1:6 Sancho exhales relieved
WHERE’S ROY KEANES REACTION !!!
"Leopards don't change their spots" - Roy Keane
I didn't see any tactical ideas from the ole and he dosen't speak with the players he doesn't add any touch on the plan during the both 45 half.. it's like the players are playing without preparations  or communication .. football matches are like chess for the coach and they always try to come up with the best tactics and moves and tricks to be able to win or to outcome a defeat .. with ole all I see is someone with no clue watching the the screen like the rest of us
Liverpool though 😂 That's pure embarrassment.
I am a huge Man utd fan but I can't grapple with this game not even just the result but the way they scored and the body language man utd showed this is completely unacceptable
Man Utd is a banter club and that's not even banter.
Ole will be sacked for sure ...he has the players good enough to win the title but he is not the right manager for Manchester...he has toomuch respect for some of the players...he doesnt know what to do at critical situations...
uNiTeD WiLl fInIsH 3Rd - gArY nEvIlLe
typical overreaction by neville ,wont say a thing about ole .just a waste of time really
This is going to be the season with the weirdest results EVER due to the lack of crowd atmosphere and and the 12th man phenomenon. Visiting teams are not as daunted and some players are thriving in the empty stadiums whilst others are weakened and lethargic.
The end is no longer near; the end is now HERE!  Tomorrow may be too late for you; no one is guaranteed tomorrow. We are all sinners and the wages of sin is eternal death in hell! REPENT and ACCEPT JESUS CHRIST as your saviour today in 3 simple steps.  A - Accept that you are a sinner in need of a saviour B - Believe in your heart that Jesus Christ was born of a virgin, died and shed his blood for our sins, buried, resurrected on the third day, ascended to heaven and is seated at the right hand of God C - Confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is lord of your life.
Lol Gary looked like he's just seen a ghost 😆
Roy Keane and Gary Neville would be a brilliant commentating duo on a bad United game
Chelsea drew 3 3 and they were considered bad😂😂😂😂.how come liverpool and man u like that. Football is a mystery
That Red card killed The game 🎯
Good for Jose Mourinho beat them looser 1 to 6 Tottenham Hotspur win the Premier league title now .
Man United are NEVER going to be the club they once was..
And after this interview, pool lost ridiculously. Take it easy, this is a game.
Rashford and co have had to many free meals to fat to run
I bet Man U are wishing they'd paid for Maguire by PayPal.
So is it because Tottenham is so good, or United just suck? I don't quite get it.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Least he's honest and not a biased reporter like carragher souness sue Smith Stephen warnock Jamie redknapp
Imagine having pogba, fernandes, van da beek, Greenwood, martial, Rashford etc. and having 3rd place as your goal. Banter club
Glazers and woodward going to sink Man utd, club needs clear out top to bottom. There is no transfer strategy at all, a proper run club would know who is coming in and going out from last season.
I wish Roy Keane was here "f f b f f f f f f terrible f f f f this team is fing disgusting
voice crack 3:26
Neville talking about buying players. That's the problem. All Utd do now is buy players. Just as bad as Real. Can't point fingers at City or Chelsea
" twats together
Roy Keane would go in a melt down with this outcome
Maguire is a bottom league player in England that somehow made his way into the premier league.
Shameful and idle mentality abound, i struggle to watch them these days...Get rid of Pogba for a start
Absolutely agreed with gary.something is not right at this moment..please call bob the builder to fix it
The Pogba effect
So nice to see that snobbish SOB Evra having a bad time 🤣🤣🤣
I am Arsenal guy, but these idiots deli ali and lamela should be thrown out of football for their silly dives and acting. The whole game is ruined by such players. Whats the hype all around when 11 men are playing with 10 men. It's not even
Everyone going on about it like they should be competing with teams like spurs...
Theres no conversation on how good were Mourinho’s squad were. How he built his first eleven restructured them and give them spirit. It tooks months but hes done it. Not even a quipped about spurs this is mad.
it's funny to hear luke shaw say we need players when his position is priority number one for a new signing to come in
Louis Van Gaal should've given more time.
I just wish Mourinho is still our manager.
As a neutral if have loved Roy Keane in this game lamela would of been marked for execution for doing what he did. Complete pussy!
The manager is dead, imagine what the arsenal manager could do with this team
If martial wasn’t sent off woulda been a normal game. That’s all there is to say
Phil:I am da worst in mufc  Maguire:Hold my handcuffs
Bielsa wouldn't let it happen... Ole is a fraud. Crap manager who has no balls.
Maguire really was he worth what we paid him for.he is a pain for the other defenders..he makes them look bad also.
Gary Neville absolutely spot on!
I think the problem is just the psychology of the players after Martial's red card. Your authentic striker is out when you're losing (those 2 goals are very, very stupid and bullshit btw). Harry lost his captaincy power after the Greece scandal. Baily not a good cover. 6-1 is just a number. Things are currently wrong inside the team.
We were just playing like crystal palace anyways bruno should be the captain not harry maguire
Get Keane in as Ole's assistant and you wilk see a different mentality in the players for sure.
Roy Keane is currently under house arrest in order to prevent a mass murder
On a day where the gods say "no" to common football knowledge, stuff like this can happen, and I'm all for it!
Typical United.
Pfffffffff" you know Garry is salty
hahahah, I have never seem such an obvious case of projection. As if when a goal down united players were thinking of other team's transfer business. xD
As Long as Bruno scores from a penalty , im happy. LOL
Get off your knees and supporting Marxist death ideologies would be a start
Mourinho had, Alexis, Lukaku, Herrera, Valencia, Young, Smalling and Jones performing. All experienced ... but Ole thought because the fans said so.. that Lukaku wasnt enough.. i mean.. wtf.. some ghost is bhind all these coaches that are being sacked
Problem with Man Utd they’re trying to buy their way to the top and that’s not the United way. Utd needs a grass roots team with a few star players. invest in the youth and build. Stop trying to buy a finished product. It’s not working for you. It may have worked for City and Liverpool but it’s not working for Utd so change the strategy
Mu player to much tiktok focus on their reputation not training hard to form on pitch
Klopp trying to keep ole in his job, mans a genius
Am I missing something? Wasn't maguire and pogba WORLD Record signings in their positions respectively? Bout no investment 😂
This result doesn’t shock me cause United is crap. They always win games with the help of referees. Well done spurs
Give Ole some criticism and not the answer like a politician 🙄
Is that Gavin Williamson in the middle?
The effect that empty stadiums is having on results is amazing. Can it all be down to the so called big players not getting the applause and ovations from the crowds. It was only a couple of weeks ago that Spurs were almost as bad against Everton, just that Everton to do have Son and Kane.
Suddenly the Man City loss to Leicester doesn't look that bad 😂😂
why wasn't Keane there today
I actually believe that wen klopp first came to liverpool they were worst than this current manchester united side. Jurgen klopp addressed liverpool's problem which was defending, not scoring goals. He won nothing until he did that...man u are capable of scoring goals for fun...but who are they trying to sign in the window?? Attacking players and i think that is what's pathetic . Not 1 defender currently at that club deserves to play for manchester united  . It's gonna be a tough near future for united because players are now thinking twice before joining the club .
Smalling needs to given a chance , no joke I think he’s the only decent CB we have at the minute .
Happy days 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Get rid of Maguire, he is absolute garbage and moves like a snail!
How could you NOT have Keano on ffs?
as a toon lad I'd recommend Steve Bruce.After all, the pundits think he's doing such an amazing job.
Man United need the hairdryer treatment,the manager is too soft.Make them sleep outside for a few nights in the winter if they get hammered,that’s their punishment,tough justice but fair.Just as well Roy Keane does not own a gun,maybe he has.
Great performance United. Keep it up. Don’t listen to this wash up coach. He was great but cannot add any value to football. If you could be relegated....yes please. 😬😬😬😬😬😬
Gary is absolutely right. This is the maximum these players can give. That's how I felt actually but Gary said it clear.
I’m sure some skulls were cracked in the changing rooms after that disaster
Theatre of Nightmares really
His career is pathetic
Gary has a valid point. They need match winners in the squad with experience. They don't have to get all 90 minutes but be there to guide the ship.
COYS
Who said super Sundays are gone 😂 the result at old Trafford was expected but not 6-1.. the result at Villa wasn’t expected for them to win.. let alone put 7 past them!!! Football is great isn’t it 😂😂😂
GARY!  GARY!   GAAARY!    Valencia.....
It’s a funny old game😉
hahahahahahaha
Sort yourselves out Sky. Spurs beat Man U 6-1. You barely mentioned the winning team. Post-match turned into a counselling session for a distraught Evra. Gary Neville here does not mention Spurs at all. In fact, when bemoaning Man U's transfer policy he decides to use Liverpool as an example of a club signing players to lift the dressing room, how about Spurs, the other team that played today, they made a fairly high profile addition to the roster?  Martin Tyler was desperate for Spurs to lose so he could start banging on about Ndombele's rocky start, and Dele's predicament. Unfortunately, Ndombele equalised before he could get going, and then Tottenham took the lead. Dele made an appearance, and he so wanted to start talking about a rift between him and Jose, but it was very difficult for him, as spurs were 5-1 up by that point. He has form, in 2018 he spent the entire match discussing the rumours of Poch to Man Utd, pretty much ignoring the match being played.  And today, your transfer talk thumbnail has a picture of Dele, you clearly want him to go to give you a load of ideas for having a go at Mourinho.  People don't pay for MUTV in disguise. People don't pay just to hear how well MAN U, and City and Liverpool are doing, or how badly. There are other teams. You might improve your product by getting pundits and commentators that don't support one of three clubs.
It's best thing got beaten wreiiily at 3rd game,,, so they can wake up
Evra you were there when city are score
Brendan Rodgers should be the Man Utd manager
I bet Richmond FC would beat man u 😂😂
As usual sky focus on Man Utd rather than how well Spurs played.....Typical of the bias reporting from sky sports!!! Surprise surprise their are other teams playing refreshing football scoring goals, and great entertainment outside of Manchester Anfield goonersfield and Chelsea? How about reporting on an even playing field!!! Huh? Disgraceful bias!!!
Imagine roy keane in garys place
1:58 I have no more stress because of, *p  a  i  d t o b e h o m e .c o m*
Keep Pogba please 🤣🇮🇹
🤣👍
Me:                   I've got a rusty 1983 Ford Sierra. Yours for 3 grand... Ole Solskjær:  3 grand for that pile of scrap? Me:                   You paid 80 million for Harry  Maguire. Ole Solskjær:  Do you want cash or cheque?
Only true sportsman can answer thissss.. Are you one of them, then answer thiss... What time does a tennis player get up?
New manager new players
Race to relegation is ON!
Only liverpool Fan will hiut like and rply yesss.....  can liverpool get 100 likes???
Tottenham Romp hahaha! What is Maguire doing?
How long? What else needs to happen, for us to accept that managers have been exploited on our club as escape goats... for the fact that our board simply is incompetent! outdated! have no clue about how football evolved since 2012, resist to change and reorganize the structure! ED WOODWARD PLLLEEEEAAAASSEEEE LEAVE THE CLUB AND TAKE YOUR BOYOS WITH YOU GO BACK TO J.P.MORGAN... THATS WHERE YOU BELONG, NOT WITH US, YOU ARE NOT A FOOTBALL MAN! YOU'VE TAKEN MORE THAN ENOUGH MONEY FROM US FOR YOUR RETIREMENT!!!  We have to get a serious technical analysis department, we need to be serious on transfer markets, we need to update the training centre, we need a new club philosophy!! we need a new game identity!! we need to demand more from everyone from CEO to Cleaners!  When us fans buy a shirt, pay for tickets, pay for season seats, pay for tv channels to watch the games, we do so because of the club! NOT FOR THE RICHIE RICH TO TAKE OUR MONEY TO YOUR OWN POCKETS!
and then liverpool lost 7-2
of course Jose was right - and everyone hasn't acknowledged who Spurs have brought in this window, coz we are Buzzing - and no, not just Bale. Manu need to look deep into their soul right now, they look totally lost
Make no mistake. I know Ole was not backed enough this summer. But with the current squad, you have to beat Palace, Brighton and Spurs. What did we get: we got outplayed tactically in all 3 games. Yes the board takes responsibility for poor recruitments off the pitch, but the poor performances and results in these 3 games are down to the coaching staff.
Everybody thinks it's FIFA game or something like they think Rashford and Martial are rated 90+ in real life or something. Their head is so messed up. Man Utd need world class attacker.... Rashford & Martial are just average player. When are you going to realize that people...... Man Utd need world class attacker (winger) and commanding defender..... That will really make the difference...
Manchester United are just not that good.
Thiago and mane are in quarantine because possitive covid 19 Maguire is possitive over price
Glazers and Woodward are the problem they are destroying Man United and now bring in Cavani, what a joke
Hey Philly boy. Stop cribbing and crying. Don’t say Man U’s plumber had a bad day that impact on the performance etc. You are incoherent as always.  Oli is no Jose. You threw a great manager. You suffer. ManU is not what it used to be and the opposition has improved over years.  Cry baby cry! You pathetic pundit.
I wouldn’t dare pull out on Van Gaal, Gary.
。
Get rid of Maguire and Bailly. Maguire 80 million, yeah right 😂! At this point, I would rather have Smalling and Jones.
4 games in not 3
£
why was roy keane not there?????
I want to see Roy Keane's reaction
current man utd team are boys not men.... they are social media darlings... its like a uni team... they r just enjoyin the ride..
OGS repeatedly using Suicidal tactics.. United playing 4-2-4 leaving an already weak defense horribly exposed. Crazy stuff
Bruno and pogba can't play together as neither want to defend
Put in Roy Keane manager please. Every manchester  players under performed definitely will pee under their skirts just seeing Roy's shadow  Ole  is just a softy image no one fear nor respect.
The problem is felt backs and back defender and scores where M United use to be strong 💪 .... Arsenal fans point of view.
Maguire is too awkward for a footballer. He's not a talent, just a big obstacle opposing strikers have in their way.
They are all overpaid ,, world class my arse , a mediocre player is getting millions , and not even picked ?
Get rid of bankers at Utd and get in someone who knows about football please Woodward resign you are rubbish and do some decent business not bad sightings
If they had Keano there would’ve been chairs flyin across the room
Roy Keane on De Gea last season vs Spurs:   "I wouldn't even let 'em on the bus after the match, get a taxi back to Manchester"  Now the whole team and share an Uber together
City lost 5-2 last week, Liverpool lose 7-2, United lose 6-1; we have officially entered the Twilight Zone.
Ole take ur wheel n fuk off
what a match i agree with neville im sure he was whimpering like a rat and keano was fuming to, fergie chewing his chewing gum your all rats
I wish Roy Keane was there.
3:28 little ball squeak xD
If ole lose game  he doesn't learn nothing from it. Because he just put the players inside to do anything they wont  no plans for them.  No tactics  poor management too. Ole is not coach for United.  Ole doesn't have first team.  Ole can not offer United players better football
Deserve every bit after what they did to burnley last week
Mcguire...............      ...................
So when are the £100k to £200k PER WEEK players going to start being Professional and stop acting like spoilt kids?  See this is the problem when you pay kids adult wages it goes to their heads
Good football player but poor analysis. You cannot be psychologically damaged going into a match. If that was the case, you will have 3 good teams and 17 psychologically damaged ones. The league has to follow the American football example of having a net spend ceiling. All teams should start on equal footing or past transgressions that led to teams being successful and hence having more money will be perpetuated. UEFA should look into this.
Get Roy Keane into that changing room, these players need their heads kicked in.
Another MU segment that will no doubt appear on Sky Sports Retro in the future...
Three lawers running Utd how pathetic
Hurrah
So they think the problem is Pen Utd did not spend enough?🙄
Pogba and Bruno had a fight in the changing rooms at half time. Club killed stone dead by three public school chums from Bristol Uni.
man united need a new defense , lindelof sucks  , bissaka is ok and now with telles left is ok but hte center of defense is awful harry maguire 80 million euros really is so bad
Potential signees,especially the quality ones, don't want to play for Solskjaer, they don't see that he'll improve their game.
Your bang on Right Mr Gary Neville!!!!!!
Why would Sancho join this shambles of a club lmao 😂😂😂
Roy Keane isn't swinging punches, he's dropping bombs.
And what happened to liverpool 😂😂
Utd had 10 men against a decent Jose team. Liverpool had 11 against a young Villa
Gary talks like they should be gunning for titles but lets be brutally honest here. If the owners of United truly had that as their number one priority there is not a cat in hells chance they would have employed Ole.   They wanted a boss who would be liked by the fanbase, because of his history, whilst they extract the maximum amount of revenue out of the club. They want him to finish top 4, get champions league football and sell a dream that next year will be their year.   I simply dont believe if you have aspirations to be the top club and win titles, you employ someone who on a constistent basis has no chance of competing with the likes of Guardiola, Klopp etc. Top clubs employ tier 1 coaches. Clubs that are used as a cash cow for the detached ownership employ yes men.
Apart from Gary, every former manu players never backed Mourinho. They were bashing him all day. Mourinho always pointed that most of these players don't have passion to play but they never backed him. These former players were saving insta models and crybabies all time. But suddenly their best friend is facing same problem they realise its players who are not giving best to club.
I don't know why man utd fans rant about Lindelöf when he was bench yesterday....but seriously how did the team conceded 6 goals? 🤦🏻‍♂️
utd moan and moan and moan that they have no players, have not spent any money - wat a load of b*llocks, have spent an absolute fortune...
If Roy Keane was on the panel he would have given Man U a second annihilation and whilst he's at it, give the Americans on the Board a bloody good hiding and finished them all for this season.
Gary looks like he died inside
Lol what a weird psycho analysis by Gary. I think an unfair red card is the most deflating thing ever. Something really british about 'off the pitch' stuff. Still the most rational eng ex player loll
You guys should be praising Jose Mourinho for the good work he done with this lazy man utd players.
United killing the compition in a negative way
same conversations whenever man u lose. then they bounce back and win the next 3 and everything is suddenly on the up. then another loss and this cycle starts again.
Sky sports proving once again they are Man United TV. Literally no mention of how good spurs were at all after the game... simply focused on Manchester United.
Imagine Roy Keane on yesterday - BOX OFFICE!! 😍 This massacre and a few hours later..."Hi Jurgen. You had a problem with me calling Liverpool sloppy in some aspects of their play the another day?" 🤣
United needs patrick evra vidic ferdinand and valencia rn.
Roy keane probably is being held by the army so that he don't go and murder the whole man utd squad
Youtube is getting real comfortable with these double no skip ads .   Ads = AIDS
They should sell Maguire for 8 million and get a decent CB who can defend or atleast don't commit own goals likr him.
😂shocking performance
Amazing spurs..........👍
Mou was right, 2nd with that Squad was an incredible achievement.
Everyone’s accumulator was fucked this weekend🤦🏾‍♂️🤔🤣
Please Mr. EdWoodward buy player that Ole really need. Please...  Really miss those day when Neville Vidic Rio Evra at the back...
Say it Gary, OGS cant get the best out of these players. He lacks character on the technical line, he doesn't motivate, shout, command etc. He is very comfortable in his chair and that little screen he has on his side.
Man U board be like: "lets gift Smalling, that will fix it!"
Man U: we lost 6-1 Liverpool: hold my beer
If you are reading this comment:  BE BLESSED!!!   x1,000,000!!!💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛
Cant wait to see the Man U panic buying after this!
I don't know is it a technical thing or psychological thing or maybe both. Me being a Chelsea fan, understood and compromised about our defence at the last legs of previous season, even at the starting of the season. But what Chelsea didn't lack is character which really thrived to go advantage offensive play. Man UTD clearly lacking that spirit and character
United will be in the wilderness your another 5, 10, 15 years if Woodward remains in charge of football matters. He's a money man not a football man. The next step will inevitably be Ole getting the sack or he'll walk, someone else will come in and the cycle will begin again.
We know the problem is Ed Woodward, not the Glazers as Evra has pointed out several times. Question is, how do we get Ed out, properly? We can sit here, comment on chats, pundits have their opinions, but what's the tangible step to get him out of United? 2nd Question is, how do we get a Director of Football in, a man who bleeds Man United?
Up the villa
Spurs villa 13-3 united Liverpool
RatBoy Neville STFU!!!
rarely do i defend  the unwashed but that was a grossly unfair red card - one goes = both go
Neville still can’t criticise his mate. It’s clear Ole is just out of his depth. You feel sorry for the guy really.
Maguire needs to only play cup games now that Telles is coming in
Where is Roy Keane when you need him
At 2-1 down against 11 Utd could have got back into it. The ref totally ruined the game.
Ole isn't great but he's not the main problem. the squad just isn't good enough. they need at least 3 or 4 world-class players to come into the squad if they want to get anywhere near Liverpool and City's quality. it looks like they're going to sign Telles, which is an excellent signing, but they needed at least 2 more to elevate the team and it's not going to happen. they argued with Dortmund all summer over Sancho for no reason. Dortmund didn't need to sell and Sancho wasn't going to force a move. either pay the 120 million or don't bother. they're just wasting time and giving fans false hope. and they should be looking at Upamecano, Skriniar, Gimenez, or any other quality centre-back they can find and bring them in asap. preferably 2 because Maguire might be the worst big-money signing in Premier League history (debatable with Kepa).
pathetic and disgraceful for such a big club, better look forward, train harder and have the spirit as  the champions
What goes around comes around in one way or another.
Why is this trending? Just some regional Football broadcaster dispassionately complaining about a single club.....
what do utd do in training . in game time they have no patterns of play  with a long time while  still buying players on huge transfer fees and massive wages .
Man utd= we lose 6-1 its so embarrassing (Few moment later) Liverpool= you'll never walk alone. Lose 7-2 against villa. That's called the true legend.
I think Spurs are the team to beat this season- well done 👍
Im a Chelsea fan but bruhhh it hurts to see man united like this. This club used to be a nightmare. Now it's a joke
Will sky ever praise spurs on the performance today instead talking about Man Utd.
Fifa 21 should put “acting skills” in one of their players trait
Sky had 1 job to do and that was make sure Keane was on sky today 🤣
Crying over not spending enough basically. United have spent hundreds of millions of the last five years. You just keep buying the wrong players and picking poor managers
Players excuse we need good players..but they git already good players they just need to hardwork.. Old manu players (evra rooney ronaldo david ryan rio gary) work hard they came as young players and made their name , but players like lingard pogba rashford (got talent and priced heavily) they go for fame once got good 💰 they stopped doing hard work.. and it's an obvious thing for a player to get hurt to see his team going down like this man they had done lot of hardwork for the team and see
We cannot drop these standards!!???? Garry wake up!!!!! Cmon
You are covering for the manager we have good players wiz good manager we can achieve good things wiz those players
The 11 who started the game  are skilled enough to handle Tottenham at old Trafford. No excuses. 1.coaching is not good enough  2. players are not motivated enough to give their best every single second on the pitch.  3. Ole and his staff lack tactics and strategies acumen. 4. Glazers are not worthy owners of Man utd.   Roman Abrahimovich is thousands times better than Glazers. 5. Ed Woodward should appoint director of football and should not  interfere in  footballing decisions. 6. Should have got Upamecano or kalidou .  We needed  a CB and LB definitely. After that we should have gone for  RW or CAM.
How much more money does Ole need to spend?
So now who’s to blame players Ole Jose who???
Atleast liverpool lost
Full of excuses 😂 it isn’t about buying new players or bringing players in it’s just simply Utd isn’t the team from 20 years ago .  All we need to say Teams like Everton, Wolverhampton and Aston Villa are above Utd these days.
if only Roy keane was in that  dressing room
Get 1 or 2 GOOD centre backs. We know they’re hard to get but Lindelof and Maguire are an awful partnership.
Man Utd need a new board, a decent manager, a keeper, a right back, 2 cb, a left back, 2 midfielders & 3 up front players 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 good luck you mugs.
You lot are mad 😠  Ole been at the wheel is the best thing thats happened to you lot in years. Love from leeds ❤
Accept it, Man Utd are becoming like my club Arsenal. But at least you can spend money.
I hate that coloured guy in the studio
I keep saying that there are no more footballers these days. These are just guys that are paid big fat money to wear fancy jerseys and shots and beautify our TV screens. That's they know and that's all they can do. The art of Football is long gone. I really miss the high technique players we used to have back in the days.
MU ㅠ,,ㅠ ㅋㅋㅋ
Gary is right.. The board have let every manager down at the worst time again.. No excuse for such a poor performance.. What are they doing in training? Nothing ever seems to really improve as a team or individually..?  Edd Woodward is incompetent in this roll.. How the hell has he kept his job?
the clowns didn't really think about our defence. they want sancho cavani bla bla bla. and they feel safe with a fridge and a piece of wood guarding our defence. fck you glazer edwood.
Pogba is poison....sell that over rated prick
Everton signs James, boom, top of the league
It’s time for Souness to be put out to pasture.
I am Partizan Belgrade fan and believe me when I tell you, when Partizan's 1.6 milion player Soumah made Maguire look like he just started to play football I knew this team is doomed. This is not Ole's fault that he has a squad full of guys that think they know football.
Looks like Lazarbeam
Poch
I could just see Ole giving players a  arm around the back after the game while still praising them.  Nice bloke, but he's too soft and will do anything to avoid confrontation.
Bang on as always
Solskjaer: "To be fair Liverpool got thrashed as well."  Klopp: "Well, you can blame us all you want but look at Man United..."
Breaking my heart this club I love, I don't think the board members realise the pain of the fans. It's not just the fans it's Family members work colleagues because they will have to put up with me being cranky and Shi**y with everyone for a week now again. I see comments here about Liverpool's loss,  F Liverpool we need to look at ourselves.  Ole will get the blunt of it now and yes there is better managers out there but come on a bit of game management from the players also would help, my good I'd try more in 7 aside
woodward out !!!
I dont know how Maguire ever became a professional footballer.
Not a good day for any Reds....
Stop banging on about finishing third last season, and Ole did the best he can. They got 66 points, any other season that's out of the top 4. By Gary's reckoning they're getting no more than 66 points again. Still, the comments about Liverpool aged extremely well..
now understand to alexis sanchez.... a heartless dressing room. GTFO !  Great job alexis :)
Master of Puppets
Relax. Cavani incoming.
Man U may get the short benefit by by not recruit new players so much.. it saving money..but,for the long term.. it not good.. because,if u not finished top of 6.. no one will wanna join ManU.. so,recruit new player is a must.. not just recruit.. but really need have best player in the position..
Need a new whole back line only decent player is awb
By the end, United was only attracting pity - Shaw's chop on Moura was a straight red without doubt
Souness was loving this up until the Liverpool game started.
When do we transition to the triple face  YouTube thumbnail?
All the United legend's and fans laughed at Jose when he said Finishing 2nd with that United squad was his best achievement . Now look who's laughing 😂😂😂😂 after his team banged United 6-1. Atleast Neville released his mistake.
i'm a liverpool supporter. i feel sorry for evra, neville and man utd supporters for the last match result & man utd not going forward. i know the feeling because liverpool had similar situation on previous managements, and yes man utd should fight for title not 3rd place or champions league place
I really wish Keane was on this
You look so stress out lol. This is karma coz you used to mock and belittle other teams, sorry. Cheers!
3:29 reality set in .
if u playing for that Badge, pls respect cause this squad are not even motivation
Did Neville really say Man United have to win the title at the end ?  Is he delusional ?  Honestly the ex-team mates don't want to blame Solskjaer but I don't think he has any respect in the dressing room.
"We need players" but which good player would wanna join this pathetic club right now.😬
That's most probably the most pointless argument I've seen him make in a while
When the dressing room runs the show !! They décide when n how to play n Ole has no influence... Get rid of pogba earliest
Mourinho was right, getting this squad to 2nd in PL was a massive achievement for him. And today he perfectly illustrated why.
what level of liverpool we are talking about here Gary?
Phil Jones hides in the toilet whenever he sees Ed Woodward
I don't know whether van de beek is the priority signing this season, Why not buy KOULIBALY and UPAMECANO now.. Get rid of maguire and lindelof now Woodward scumbag
Ole to his assistant: "I dont want to play Maguire again... what is the alternative? Assistant: "We have Phil Jones, Sir"  Ole *facepalm  Ole: “Get me a gun”  Assistant: “No, Sir... you can’t shoot Jones, it’s a murder”  Ole: “No, I have a better idea. I’ll just shoot myself instead”
And Man United started with De Gea WHY? WHY DIDNT OLE PLAY WITH HENDERSON!?
They are done.  Gone case.  Ole should stay the idiot players should leave.
Gary Neville just can't mention the 'Everton' word yet. Lol!
Wish leeds where playing them soon😁
Dont blame the red card, MU play bad in that game
Well said Gary👏
As bad as the players were they can be a lot better than that with a better coach/manager. The players need coaching psychologically and physically. We all know the board is inept but that coupled with a poor coaching staff and there you will see results like this. Then again who is responsible for hiring the coaching staff. sigh!
1:39 I quit my work with the help of, *p  a  i  d t o b e h o m e .c o m*
Buy New Back 4 Telles, Badiashile - Upamecano-Lamptey
Pogba was not only worthless but actively tried to injure Spurs players. Utterly useless to spend those millions on him
Outdated Ole.
spineless? pathetic? spiritless? thats typically english words ..can i use my football malay words on my own? thanks .. its a SIAL! ANAK HARAM! utd PUKIMAK! show ..
Overpaid players its that simple....regards Tony
Ole, Evra, Neville, Keane, all know the level required, but the owners or Ed Woodwank have no idea. Which is why it is near impossible to get players in that are at that level ... bankers do not know about levels, only money. Remember Van Gaal openly stating the type of players he was given?? 7th or 8th choice ... it must be so demoraliaing & I can definitely see why Jose cracked the shits. So sad to see this happening 😥
COYS.
Man U are a joke and won’t finish above 8th this season or ever in that matter and when the likes of pogba and co get put down like that yeah they bounce back next game but there consistency is poor all year round and rubs of on the youth because they think they can get away with the same and it’s really starting to show all over the park
City and Liverpool were more offensive in their losses. They can easily fix that by defending a little more. United conceded 6 goals just by defending.
Same players threw Jose under a bus. Thrown Ole under bus now.  Ole serious scrutiny feel his days are numbered. Woodward has  not backed Ole with signings.
Somebody said Ole is a lucky boy
Maguire doesn’t deserve to be the captain he needs to be kept on bench for god’s sake. Why isn’t dony getting any time game ? I think both ole and maguire need to pack their bags
I've been saying for the longest time that Ole is just a mediocre manager that will never break the 70-point barrier irrespective of the players at his disposal. Leeds, Everton, and Brighton are all playing amazing with no £80 million players let alone a £100+ million winger.
Its tactically a wrong line up.
I went to change my password to 'ManUChampions2020'...computer said not enough character, defense too weak and unrealistic
.                       De Gea AWB      Smalling    Bailly    Telles              Pogba       Matic                   Van de Beek Fernandes                     Rashford                       Cavani
Where’s Roy Keane ?
Go go Facebook and search Follow Jesus and friend request-Follow Jesus
Spot on Gary with all the cash that Man United has you can't tell us,that's the best you could do pathetic is to kind.
seriously, all man utd, nothing about how good tottenham was in the break.
Man united don’t just need another CB but a proper leader like a Steve Bruce to tell these players like Maguire ect to get a grip.
Pogba was awful and apparently he is too important to be substituted. The defence had no midfield support for most of the match.
I said it after Brighton, we simply can’t concede like that. McGuire needs to be dropped. Recruit in the defence, god damn it.
I said that during the game? Harry Maguire body is there,but his mind in is on his outside mess and not on his football. Drop him take Armand of him until  Harry sort his mess. Am a Toon fan who, love football in general. My Dad who is Man United through and through was is a bad away, it proper hurt him today,because of this game.
sadly Old trafford become training ground from other team now...xD  like how they lose easily in their own stadium
Sack alert. Sack alert.
80 mill Maguire you’re having a laugh
Once again penandez strikes again
Del Boy would be proud of Leicester with that Maguire deal, they stitched United right up.
not the club we grew up with. The temple has fallen. Dark corona days ;'(
from penalty fc to banter fc pmsl ,,,,,,pendemic pathetic
If you want to be saved and have everlasting life believe Jesus died on the cross for our sins, and was buried. Then, rose on the third day, which proved He is truly our God and Savior. John 3:16 “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”
Narrative of Self is the result of a feedback loop between “Separate Self” & Cosmos✌️Non-Duality
So upsetting I am really angry ole out keane or Bruce in get rid of all the players keep van beek  Henderson
Chris smalling has great positioning system he migjt not be the fastest but maquire has been found out he only.looked good in leicester because he had ngolonkante one season and next seans wilfred ndidid the best defesnvie medfliedners on both season he was there.
Ex-United pundits in 2020 are the ex-Liverpool pundits in the 2000s. Reliving their glory days, unable to accept the current iteration of their team are simply not good enough
Martial should have hit harder so he could at least earn the red card.
all the players cared about the politics, not about putting in a performance!
Fun fact: You can actually insert coins between Phil eyebrows
Ole outttttttttt pls.
Love how each and every question is being connected to the fact that they failed to sign players. Now imagine what job frank lampard has done with Chelsea last season with losing the best player and no new signings. Also shows the hypocrisy of sky people who are literally covering the failures of manager & players on the pitch by talking minimum about it.
Imagine if Harry Maguire wasn’t English?
huh
Neville adding an extra 30m onto Citys spending.
Nothing to do with getting battered by a brilliant side then?
What's worse. Utd result today or liverpool's. City last week. Come on. These freak results happen. Are liverpool in jeopardy now. They lost 7-2 to a club that left it to the last day to survive. All bull.
Man Utd. have assembled a 700m quid squad and fans are complaining.. smh. Fact is ur manager isn't getting the best out of the players he has. As an Arsenal fan I sincerely hope Ole and Lampard stay where they are this season, cause it gives us a chance at top 4 with only Gabriel coming in and Willian on a free...
First, Man U's current team needs to stop committing so many dumb errors within their own penalty box. If they aren't sure of how to play the ball, then try a long pass to your attacking front instead of doing short passes and messing up.  Second, if they want to continue using Maguire then get an experienced defender to play alongside him... he's literally all over the place instead of at the right spot.  Luke Shaw shouldn't even be talking about world class players, because he's not one of them.  Man U should seriously consider selling Pogba and any other deadweight within their squad and obtain a player or two with a fresh mentality looking to challenge for their spot... he's probably the one sending bad vibes in the locker room and everyone looks up to him since he's the "star" player.  Not a Man U fan, but the game really got out of hand in the first half for Man U and neither the players nor the manager were willing to do something about it. As soon as you're down to 3-1 or even down one man, you make quick changes to reinforce the area that your team was lacking. They should have fought for a tie at least but they didn't even bother.
Every dog has its day guess it was  yours today liverpool and Manchester United enjoy today as an arsenal fan. Thanks again guys
Man U still waiting on Pogba, he still need more time. Caption this, This is Pogba
I don't get why british channels keep using them mics. It just looks silly, it blocks the view of the mouth from the camera and it also ties up one hand for the person holding it.  Headsets sounds equally good.
I am a Tottenham fan.  I hate the game for Eric Ramella's unsportsmanlike behavior.  I'm Korean and I'm a fan of Park Ji-sung
Was there only one team playing? Ah yes, Spurs.
Our captaib clown.... everytime i see those 2 goals... blood just boils.... he was disrespectful to his own teammate who was doing good...and decides to pull him down.
Pogba, Maguire  are jokers. They are as slow as tortoise and you got to blame Ole because it seems he didn’t prepare the team as how they should play and react to provocation. We didn’t have a game plan. Ole pulls Bruno and leaves Pogba who loses the ball all the time on the pitch. What is his thinking? He still sat and not come to issue instructions on how to keep playing to minimize the bleed. He just had no clue!!
chomper anacreontic
Liverpool losing 7-2 is probably more of a consolation for United than the one goal they scored
Why not formed the old boys group & take charge of the Club?
Looks like he could kill every person from United clubs 🤣🤣
I support Ole all the way but if he starts Maguire and still gives him the armband in the next game then I have no hope left for this club.
Just imagine if it was Chelsea who conceded 6 goals  Angry rantman for those who  know 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
honestly... after this night's game i have a hard time deciding who would i keep in this team atm
Evra's the only one mentioning how bad Macguire is. It's like the rest of them are in denial about it 😂
Neville really is the slimy rat, almost as spineless as those players. The squad cost a fortune and most of them are quality of course a top manager would improve them.
These guys looks like clowns every time when speaking about Mourinho is finished while he can have his kind of player with winning mentality he's unstoppable. That's what Mourinho called Football heritage!!!!
Aston Villa 7-2 Liverpool  Sky Sports Football's new upload video:
All these while, they must've seen now that the problem probably aren't the managers that change all time.... if this continues, man utd could be another Leeds back in the day
Gary's face looks dead.
Thanks to Ole and Woodward for converting Old Trafford to New Trafford. The two of you stay that way until you get the worst of the exit. And Ole keep VDB on the bench as long as you can. Play your Pogba your whole life. You cannot see the worth in a player so how do you expect world class players to rush for ManU, unlike in the old days.
Very saddened and dismayed at our club, something is seriously wrong.
Have you seen VDB play. He and Bruno is running around lifting the spirit of the team mates as they play. What does Pogba do? a point box in the team, so slow, fouling always? why do you buy VDB if u want to bench him?
I feel Evra's pain. The whole defence and midfield was woeful. No shape at all. Where was the captain today? He looks all at sea, no authority, no organisation, no leadership...Basic school football errors....where was the guts and determination from any of the players.....Shaw coming into the centre all game, allowing Spurs acres of space on right - what was all that about?.... Do not allow Smalling to leave and drop Maguire and Bailly and De Gea. Great managers make brave choices - captains need to be dropped if they're not playing well. Luis Figo was dropped from Real Madrid for a while...fought for his place again and came back a legend.........Matic? I'm afraid his number is up - the quality is not there, his first two passes in the game he gives the ball away and has no end product...Pogba apparently is a world class player...zero evidence today and work rate is poor. Fernandes couldn't hit a barn door, maybe had his boots on the wrong feet. the forwards were predictable and heads went down early and no pressing on the Spurs defence...Martial is lazy. I like Fred's passion and workrate, but he just gives the ball away too many times and no end product.....Why are players leaving United and then going on to their new teams and turning out stellar performances?
Spirit less was spot on.
Van de Beek probably regrets joining Man U. They need Pochettino ASAP
take the job Gary..since you know  well
pochettinho still available......ole is not a manager.....he is only a former player
I like Gnev but he's hanging on to the past. United last won the title in 2013, coming up to 8 years ago so their attraction and status has definitely dropped a bit. They are still a big club with a big support, but as you see in modern day football that doesn't matter as much as it did. Money is far more prevalent for many more teams now and that evened the playing field. Coaching, culture, system coupled with smart and balanced signings are the key. How many of these can Utd tick? Not many. It can turn around in a few years for sure but Liverpool and City are miles ahead and its going to take a lot of work to get that right. They are not currently a major force at home or in Europe.
Uniteds defence cost nearly £200m. Let that sink in.
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHA
Why did Maguire take Shaw down just as he was about to clear the ball? Joke player. Joke manager. Joke club! BANTCHESTER FC
Did he call Luke Shaw a good player 🤣🤣🤣
The only silverware Maguire would have seen this season will be handcuffs! 👮‍♀️
How in the hell is Maguire captain? CAPTAIN. And he sends Shaw for the post match interview. Embarrassing
❤️ Mug United ❤️
You CAN'T blame the board when you have so called top players (what a joke) like pogba strolling around the pitch earning squillions, doing sod all and year in year out threatening to move for another pay day. Sack the PLAYERS first.
Support man u born at least 1000 miles away from manchester get what you deserve you plastic fans
As a arsenal fan, I feel sorry for united. This isn’t the united iv passionately hated over the last 25 years. There is no fight in their team, it sad to see
This week is the best week man city drew with leeds, Liverpool got rammed from all holes and man united got hammered by the best team in the league!!!!!
Oles at the wheel
This result is to be expected consider how close we were to lost 4:0 to Brighton the week before. We should be asking what they are doing during training and how they cope and recover from this aftermath to see the character of the team. Only when we lost that we see the struggle and grit but when we win, it more or less about the bandwagon.
O if only he knew what was coming for Liverpool😂😂
SPEAKING CLEARLY: MAN UTD DOESENT WORK WITH NONE TEAMPLAYER! Man Utd has so mush invidual player which just looks for they selves. Its not a team. Since Pogba came back, it doesnt work anymore here. I cant belive how a Pogba could play for the beginning if every third pass is a false pass. Thats a joke! They need SMALLING AND P. JONES BACK! MAGUIRE OUT! Telles instead Shaw that would be great. His position play is awful bad! Bring a lion like Mctominay from the beginning and set POGBA OUT!!!! McT, V. D. B AND BRUNO it would work! Rashford and Martial out from the beginning! They are to ignorant and just looking for themselves. Bring creative players. And now the time is come for CAVANI! The first right center-forward since R. V. P. GREATE DEAL. This is my opinion. Im sure now its clearer for all here.
Still support Manchester United..
God got so sympathetic to Evra  he made Liverpool lose 7-2
our defense is a joke
Maguire thought he was still playing for Spurs, when did "that" to Shaw 😖 pathetic...
Have to say he's right, psychological!
Gary I blame woodward for all the things happening to our club
Serve them right!!!!Kick Ole n Woodward out...
It's a big blow going 1-0 down within 1 minute.  But Spurs players didn't let it effect them.  But United players gave up after Spurs equalized in 4 minutes.  It's not the player abilities or mistakes.  It's mentality.  Spurs were winners and United were losers.
I'd rather watch Everton and Aston Villa than any of the "big six" clubs right now.
For all you saying don’t blame ole, he’s part the problem. World class club needs world class manager not former player who only credentials was relegation and managing a job in Norwegian league. Look at Everton they got a world class manager and got  recruitment right. Bring in poch who can rebuild club back to the glory days.
as a liverpool fan, its ok man u fans, the 2 biggest teams in england were embarrassed today
Mourinho got UTD to second, what an achievement
If im Southgate, i wont call Maguire for the Three Lions. Absolute embarasement
gary media Neville... RAT
Imagine if Roy Keane was analysing that performance that would of been amazing
Joke of a club. Even with the classic man u pen. Need a full rehaul on players. No leadership and fight.
dnt worry liverpool also took 7 from aston villa ahaha
Gary spot on as usual.
"we're not getting to liverpool's level" You got that right. they conceded 7 lol
Maguire smh u just have name no rep
At least it was only 1:6
Liverpool just like Man United didn't get taller, they just got chopped down!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I hope that Maguire's lawyer offered a better defence than Maguire did today.
Typical how its a "man utd capitulation", if the score went the other way it would be a "man utd demolishing". Whenever a team destroys man utd, they never get full credit, its always "man utd were bad", not "..... were amazing"
Liverpool didn’t want us to walk alone
So funny when they realise it wasn't Mourinho fault and I bet they wish they listened and allowed Mourinho to get rid of the players and bring his own in
Man United needs someone like Gasperini. If it wasn't for Covid-19, probably Atalanta was in the final of Champions League this year. They only played one match against PSG, instead of 2. Normally was 2 legs in the "happy era".
Harold Maguire; the new Philip Jones?
🤣😂🤣
They should get mourinho in as manager 😂
How many players do you need? You’ve been in the market all season
This is the worst season start
This is a sad day
There's one thing that many people forget about... All the football teams, are missing the home support from they're own fans. We are living the worst year in our era. Nothing is like it use to be.
Gary ain’t happt
What's wrong with Man United's owners? They've spent a lot of money no1 spends that much in the hopes of going backwards. Compare your owner's to Arsenal or Liverpool's hell's they won't even dig into their pockets
This season is gonna be sick
When you see the crease in between gary nevilles eyes, you wont be able to focus on anything else......everything that comes out his mouth will become gibberish, as your eyes get sucked into the crease-abyss
I feel bad for fernandes and Van Da Beek
In the work place, you get called out for not performing and can't blame anyone but yourself. In the world of football, especially United, these fraudsters will blame the manager for their woes and will still retain their contracts and be rewarded handsomely. This is not right and undermines everything United stands for. Glazers and Woodward need to go so the club can rebuild from the top and not just on the pitch, Woodward and co allow for these fraudsters to perform like clowns and get paid like moguls.
If Maguire is $80mil then iam at least $5mil and Kalidau Koulibali is $4-5Bil
HA!
ManUTV or sky sports?
so all this this time man u  ade Mourinho look terrible, but he spoke straights facts, we just wasn't behind the scenes
de Gea  - dodgy shaw - garbage Maguire - class Bailly - ok wan bissaka - good Matic - ?? pogba - shot him asap greenwood - hype job rashford - absolute hype job martial - garbage Fernandez - complete hype job - not creative at all
Martial should not diserve a red card!!!if yes than the other player could get a red one too!!!! But totally agree with Gary...
The empire rise   The empire falls  The world spins   They are the rules ..........
Mr SOUENESS The only man with any balls left on tv lineker is a clown
Pogba! How long more until United get rid of him ?
jose has finally had the last laff!!!! XD
ManU Liverpool defense blah blah blah. Maybe just maybe Everton Tottenham Aston is clicking and playing good football? Ever thought about that? Pundits. Give credits where its due
manyanited wont recover from dis LFC bloody feckin will!!!!! I will eat my shoes if Klopp and the boys fall off a cliff now!!!
3:29 epic voice crack
Hang on a minute, this is one of the most expensive squads in the world.
Can see city going down that route soon to be honestc
That voice crack tho
Maguire tackled Shaw in his box 😂
I know people made fun of Phil Jones but that guy played with everything he had. All those dumb faces of him on the ground were him giving his all. People made fun of him when he was on his knees crawling after the ball trying to head it away, but Jesus who rn at man u wouldn't just watch the ball go by.
Don't matter about price anymore talk about maguire and vvd 80 million pound players and there teams are letting in 5 plus goals what a shambles
Well if only i could have climbed into my tv screen, id have throttled Mguire...hes useless..get rid!  Asap!
Evra speaking for every united fan 😤shambolic
if only roy keane was here...
This give me flashbacks to his rant against United when they lost to Everton
3:29 "PoUnDs"
He put salt in his tea
Gary Neville gives the best in depth analysis out of any pundit I know......raw facts.
Why didn't you get big Roy Keane in for today 😭😭
Has anyone checked to see where Roy Keane is ??
Ole just stop being a puppet. Bench Maguire and let Smalling play. I am sure he would have been much better.
How is maguire captain Phil Jones looks like prime Maldini compared too the muppet
Maguire is as bad as Kepa was for Chelsea. All that money spent and both are garbage! If Utd got rid of Maguire and Bailly and played Henderson in goal, then they would already be doing better and would be losing 2-1/3-1 instead of 6-1.
I guess when he was released from prison in Greece his game stayed in his cell instead of coming back to Manchester with him.
And what’s oles role in all this. No one seems to want to criticise ole in the media and I don’t understand why. If mourinho was in charges of this united team and lost by 6 to this rather average spurs side they would chase him out of town. This united team is good enough to beat all the teams they have played so far this season. How much money has been spent since ole came and how much does he want spent ?? Smh
YOU MAD BRO? You’ve been spurred on. Haha. It’s embarrassing for you b/c you’ve got your arse kicked by the man you sacked. 🤔
Im sick and tired of Gary Neville and some supporters making excuses for Ole even after this result! What will it take for people to start noticing that Ole is such a terrible manager!!! Yes, Glazers+Woodward+all the deadwood gotta F**k off, but so is Ole.  Ultimately it was Ole who picked the team, players and formation  And as always he seems to be getting away with it again!!! Unbelievable.
Should never have sacked jose...to deny him a centre back, sack him, then spend 70m on maguire... who is making those decisions 😂
3:28 that voice crack
I think the team is good, there not consistent. When they goof off like that, there’s no fear of punishment from the manager. That’s why Ole is to soft for the job. Years ago - past Arsenal forwards were speaking if they gave the ball away and didn’t run back and defend, they would be punished by Wenger. If Ferguson was manager, these players would be giving more then 100 percent. A lot of it is on the players, most of it is on the board.  Don’t know what’s happening but there needs to be change.
it is not about new signings, the current group of players are simply s**t, each of them.
The same Man U that was dominating English football and The champions league 🤣
COYS!!!💙💙💙
Lets "Bully Maguire"
Ole and woodward have to go. Ole has gotten his team selection so wrong ONCE AGAIN. I would never give ole 120million if I was the owner. Why put pogba who was infected with covid instead of using Van Beek who is 100% fit.  Why keep using lindelof? Why replace Ronemo when he was doing so well!!! Ole must stop apologising and simply leave and give the club to another manager who does not make emotional decisions.
Man Utd's net spend this summer is more than Liverpool according to transfermarkt 😂
Why does ole still think that lining up utd in a 4-5-1 is good
Such a joke this team
Red card s not fair that impact the  match much
Got to stop blaming everything on recruiting. It's not like they don't have any players at all. The manager needs to get more out of the players he has.
united simply need more pace
Imagine losing to a team who have more spiders than trophies in their trophy cabinet 😂
He is pretty good with his analysis. Recognises that the squad are lost at sea, not the manager.
Agreed
Would legit prefer a Jones and Smalling partnership next week
Since Fergie left until the present day, the playing squad has seen expensive signings come-and-go (Memphis, Schneiderlin, di María, Falcao, Sánchez, Lukaku, Fellaini, Mkhitaryan), four different managers hired (three fired, maybe the fourth soon). The constant during this seven-year period has been the CEO and ownership. Shouldn't take a rocket scientist to see what the fundamental problem is
Gary “Spineless” Neville
At least he got to a level of City last week and Liverpool this week
3:27 who else heard that voice break
Can we stop calling De Gea one of the world's best now?
That one crease at the centre of his head is the number of goals United scored tonight
They constantly talk about "transfer window" - they buy players and they're still crap and need more players - its the same story over and over again - then new players coming also and they become miserable like the rest of em. Something is not right with the spirit of this club. Buy players with character and skills not nice hair.   Maybe Roy Keane should be hired as sporting director.
Anyone else just find out the presenters name is Dave?
Just when you thought everyone was going to be talking about Man U - Spurs. Then Villa beat Liverpool 7-2
Fergie: Lads, its United !   🤣🤣🤣🤣
How much more cash does Gary want Utd to spend??....they have spent well over 1b in recent years. Its the scouts an the staffs fault that players brought in have been awful. I wish our chairman would back us like Woodward has Utd.
Lucky Roy Keane wasn’t there
How much fooking money do you need to make a team that doesn't get shown up by  Crystal Palace , and Brighton ….its Bull crap The two places you start is Manager and goal keeper, you don,t keep playing an A team that Underperforms and  B team that gives their heart and soul and performs . Morino said he was going to build a team around Pogba , now Ole is trying to do the same …….goodbye Ole ….we have to watch this drivel yet again until he leaves end off.
Don’t worry Gary, Liverpool also got humiliated 7-2!
That voice crack though😂
Liverpool fan here and I feel terrible for United fans. I hate United but looking at the fans, it's so sad to see the decline of this club. United should be up there competing every season. Those players don't play for the badge, something that every single United player did under Ferguson. No leadership, no fight and no energy. We lost 7-2 today but I'm not having a meltdown because I know Liverpool WILL bounce back. The question now is, regarding United, will this team bounce back or blame the manager as they have done for the last seven years. Ole may or not be the man, however, what he has achieved, with these players, is actually impressive. The board needs to go, the ownership is awful, and that snake in charge of transfers, needs to leave as well. Hope to see United bounce back and fix this mess soon. YNWA
Spurs weren’t good, it’s just that united played like a national league team
3:28 we not gonna talk about the voice crack
Every word he said is true
Poor United 😂
Man U fans complaining is basically the rich kid getting an Audi for his birthday rather than a Bentley. Cry me a river.
Yes after Marcus Rashfords initiatives they should have done a lot better in the premiership.
Liverpool the city of the beatles manchester the city of the bottlers
Over rated English players. Talk about "slabhead" like he was a prime Maldini. Guy cant defend . 80 Million down the pan
im surprised none of these so called experts are calling for ole's head by now
How the mighty have fallen
Roy Keane is en route to visit De Gea
Where is Spurs’s praise?
love to see it XD
All we need is fergie as manager again and Keane as his assistant it’s really not much to ask for
Merry goes round, that is Manchester United
Imagine Alex Ferguson, would have a heart attack watching this
Y is no one saying anything about getting smalling playing
I choose Rojo & Phil Jones over that 80m Fridge. Smalling is Maldini in front of Slabhead.
I believe most people knows whats going on at the club. That bad energy around for years now, but nobody really wants to talk. Everybody gets paid while the club slowly looses its identity. The club that I used to cried for. Really cant tell how could you pick up that shirt and perform like this. After Cantona, Scholes, Neville’s, RFN, Giggs etc.. proper celebrities
evra is so right few need a good talking too but also sry ole was never the manager for us
Pogba sucks the only player who was making meaningful runs was Greenwood and the guy took him out instead of pogba
Pochettino  Allegri  Sarri Marcelino  Lardim   *Best Available Coaches out there*
🥴
Utd fans still think they'll get sancho
80mil 😂
Ye lot tought they can challenge for the title😂
Anyone know why gary has the scar In between his 2 eyebrows
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
This will be on sky retro in years 2 come
Have we ever seen a Man united manager get beat like Ole? Just embarrassing....
Tottenham the best players
Wheres John Abraham?
Well Liverpool were just as bad today so psychological edge reasoning was wrong
Solskjaer did bring McGuire in remember, he also bought AWB in and Daniel James😬 AWB is ok at defending but he literally can’t cross a ball, it’s mental, James has totally gone, confidence wise and McGuire, well I don’t know what to say about him atm.
Why on earth is it that maguire needs a partner. Sorry but he’s the weak link atm.
Spurs just ran themselves into the ground. They were passionate and explosive. Man United need a quality left back, 2 central defenders and a striker that can score goals and bring other players into the game. Harry Kane ..... MOTM.
Maguire a waste of money, so very overrated.
Liverpool fans sending messages to Manchester  today "You will never walk alone". 😂
The other old guy didnt know what Liverpool was going to play.. haha
This is a bad loss but not as bad as Liverpool's. Tottenham are better team than Villa, plus United had a player sent off early. Kinda controversial sending off as well.
I feel we've seen this rant for the past 6 years.  Move on. They're done. It happens
Its criminal that Roy Keane wasnt in the studio for this
It’s about coaching ? These players need to be coached simple is that . I don’t think Ole can coach , they need a proper Manager to get the best it them
Welcome to the theatre of a nightmare...ole n wodward out!!!!
@1.10 when he thought OGS walked in
Ole achieved 3rd with the help from the FA giving them penalties upon penalties
Liverpool and United in sixes and sevens today!
Well I was gonna make a sarcastic comment, but I'm a Liverpool fan so yeah..... 😬
You need to start Henderson asap
Neville: "There's no way Man Utd is going to get to the level of Liverpool" 90 mins later... Liverpool: "Say that again"
Villa 7-2 Liverpool This behind closed doors season, IMHO, is going to keep throwing up bizarre results. Is playing in empty stadia affecting how teams function on match day?
Pogba,Marcus,Greenwood,Fernandos are the only players that should remain the rest must go please  solskjaer
What about heart ? Fight ? Pride in the badge? Absolutely disgusting today. Disgusting.
The likes of shaw, mata ,victor lindelof, mctominay they all need to go we need a new strong team
If solskjaer keeps embarrassing us fire him too
Soooo disappointed Roy keane wasn’t on
We dont  need sancho
The whole defence must go free transfer
winger, cb and a lb. that’s what they needed. but they signed an attacking midfielder
Liverpool to ManU - YNWA
If  only Roy Keane was here...
Show me the lie
How old is Gary Neville ? Why is his voice still breaking ?
Hahahahaha I’m laughing United are so shite 😂😂
What manchester united need is a better foundation of management, not just the squad but from the catering to the ball boys to the flipping signings, this isnt the united i grew up with and i am frustrated with all these stupid mistakes which the club keeps making, WE NEED NEW MEMBERS TO LOOK AFTER OUR CLUBS
How about Gary Neville admits he was wrong about saying Arsenal defenders are uncoachable and admit that United defender are actually uncoachable....
Who heard the voice crack lol
I’m not saying anything and because my squad got beat by villa
Drop Maguire, He starts every game without question that should end today! Why does ole not change it up, He always starts with the same front 3 and in the same positions, Greenwood is not creating or contributing anything, Yes he's a great finisher but that's all he is at the moment. None of the front 3 will even look at a header and even if they did we don't cross the ball anymore always trying to pass the ball in the net. Let's go back old school,  plenty of crosses and plenty of men in the box!
3:28 pOuNDs
Mcquire needs to go! Waste of millions!
Says a lot when the goalkeeper that picked the ball up 6 times out of the back of his own net had one of the better performances out if the whole utd team
were was roy keane i'm mad mmmhmmmmhmhmmg🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬gggggg the last time man united was spanked hard on their @$$ at home was 2011 October BY MAN CITY😂😂😂😂😂
United 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂and people said this was there season
Maguire needs to get drop from the national team if this is how he is playing i would rather see a young defender that’s decent then him
Imagine paying that much for maguire .... you could have bought stevan de vrij, picked in the best team of the tournament of wk 2014 when he was way worse than he is now, voted best defender of serie a last year and he is always voted in team of the season of serie a in his years there. He is better than maguire and way cheaper
Hahahaha enjoying this more than a threesoome
Oh how i miss you Keane/Scholes/Rooney/Rio/Vidic real fighters, Real men.
I want to see Roy Keane's reaction
I'm hot💔💔💔
I don't wanna see Harry Maguire anymore in the first squad
Keep smalling! Bench Maguire he can play with under 23.. Give captain to Bruno! We got Telles! But we still need sancho a world class CB and I don’t even know anymore! We are screwed...
Afraid Man U aren't going to be winning any tittle. I think they think they're entitled to it. Well....they aren't.
Give gary the job. Maybe he do it better 🤣😂
Ole out
The manager clearly isn't good enough, the same thing happened last season until Bruno Fernandez got him out of the ditch involved in everything. Bruno Fernandez honeymoon period is over
if you sqwint your eyes and look at the score it looks like we won 1-0
He will feel better after the Liverpool result
Man U think they have a divine right....Championship contenders.....
I'm just hoping and praying that OGS doesn't get sacked. I want him to be there for as long as possible, he's perfect. in my opinion, good enough to keep his job, assuming he doesn't run into results like this (hey, even Klopp gets them as you saw) but unlike Klopp, not good enough to win the league or champions league, so yea, my great hope is that OGS keeps his job until he retires from old age.
They went to 10 men at 2-1 Gary. Killed the game... absolutely horrible decision and shouldn't even be a card. Why is football so soft these days? You can't touch another player without them going down like they've been shot. Managers are encouraging their players to cheat to win the game.... Far to many penalties being given, VAR has killed the game. I like alot of others have pretty much stopped watching except for some 2-3 min highlights on sky sports. I can't sit and watch a game anymore, even before no fans.   Week in and out you see players with no Passion for the game, or for the club collecting a disgusting wage packet.
José Mourinho did a miracle a couple of years ago with this team. I think know people are understanding his statement and Gary simply said it!
Pogba Smiled after giving away a penalty, hell to him .... get him out!!!!
Harry maguire - expensive phil jones 🙏🙏🙏🙏
Maguire should quit football and go find work as a labourer
Man Utd the biggest 'Was' side. Knowhere never biggest in world anymore
As a neutral Sky Sports is a disgrace and should just be called Man Utd / Liverpool TV, Complete bias for these teams, for 90 minutes I listened to an ex-Man Utd player on commentary waffle on about how poor "United are", then had to listen to an ex-Man Utd and ex-Liverpool player in the studio do the same, It's ridiculous, I'm a Newcastle fan and have no love for Spurs but they played well today and it winds me up with all this Man Utd / Liverpool love-in from Sky Sports, It's cringe-worthy!
Maguire you prat
On reflection, Jose is always right Gary.
There are no quick fixes.
Only if they knew what happened to Liverpool that same night....lol
The players that spurs have got in has done exactly what Gary said, they have raised the squad a got us performing better than we were. Im not saying were great but those signing boost a squad so much!
He bigged up ole for ages and wouldn’t criticise him purely because he played with him...Neville is a joke.
man utd must win the tittle  lol pompus twats, enjoy the mid table your gonna be there a while lol .
United: We were embarrassing today. Liverpool: Hold my beer.
Wish Roy Keane was in the studio he would've ripped into the players🤣
When you realise the girls school team is better man united
Get Rio back man would still boss the prem around  Vidić as well and were winning the title I swear although Bailly aint bad
I don’t see what the problem is? If United won today, that would have been a problem.
Funny that did are trying to sell smalling and jones when they are miles better then any of the cb we play
To think that Neville won 8 PL titles. Today ManU would kill for one
Barcelona and Utd are sad to look at today. From facing each other in the finals of the CHAMPIONS LEAGUE, to being a complete joke in their respective leagues.
Bro, red card for that?? NO VAR NOW? This weekend is full yet again of wrong referee decision all over the place.
What a load of crap I can't see youngsters wanting to support and buy the shirts of this rabble glazers and Woodward get your arse into gear and buy some descent players while you still have some fans left.
Gary and co. Hypocrites.
Now all the glory hunters from Aberdeen and Cornwall can shut up!
Neville is missing the point of where the problem lies, though Patrice Evra had the right idea earlier.   Neville is really looking at the problem from an "we need better players" perspective. Yes, some players delivered a lacklustre performance. Yes, it would help to invest and get some players that can bring in the extra quality needed to rival other teams top of the table. But first, the priority should be to form a strong core team.  LvG tried to create a new team. Mourinho tried to recycle and patch holes. OGS is trying to make the most out of the scraps. Each of them had ups and downs, clear signs the team didn't reach a solid core yet. All ManUtd are doing is baton-passing until they get dealt a lucky hand at some point, but who knows how long that will take?
Shocking that Ed Woodward can sit there on his phone when we all know he ain’t doing any business
Should never have god rid of Evans
As an impartial man city fan seeing this result..then Liverpool's 7-2 defeat to Villa..It doesn't seem real. What in the blue f*ck is goin' on?. And we got creamed off Leicester..then drew with Leeds..I don't know who's got the worst defence out of the 3 of us at the mo....
This is why we have to listen to people who been and done it ☝️
This aged well Liverpool did even worse what the hell happening f*ck 2020
Man U lost 1-6. Liverpool one upped, lost 2-7.
I’m sorry to say this but the gap between Man U and the likes of LFC a City is only going to get bigger ! Man U need so many new players that it can’t be done quickly, it’s too many changes and it’s going to cost a fortune. They need a whole new defence, at least two top class midfielders and at least two strikers. There are too many guys in and around that team that are just not Man U level players, EPL players yes but they aren’t good enough to win the league. I honestly don’t know where Man U go from here but I can’t see it being with OGS which is a shame as he’s a good guy but not what’s needed now.
Harry MAGUIRE. Nuffsaid
Neville:No way we going to the level of Liverpool   Aston Villa,,hold it there
Ruashford   wouldnt even get in brightons 1st team so overated . Harry mguire omg wouldn't even hold a place at Luton.  Worst man United team in history
Edward was looking like a clown today. LOL should a seen his face OMG
Build the midfield without Pogba, use Van Der Beek / Bruno / McTominay or Van Der Beek / Bruno / Matic
Gary, wait until you see what Villa did to Liverpool😃
3:30 the voice crack you’re looking for
Big time charlies, atleast in the lower leagues you get an honest performance.  That premier league is a lot of shite. Yous are welcome to your sky subsciptions, they arent getting my money.
Saddest thing was not united losing it was not having keano in the studio giving these tools a bolocking
I support leicester,  I can't believe we got 80 million for Harry  Maguire
Roy keane........hold my whisky!
theyre all missing the point. The philosophy of the club, the recruitment for the last 10 years, everything has just been so wrong and football has left them behind. They need to forget about the ferguson era, transition into a modern club who play exciting football and with a visionary manager
Maguire is absolutely shite, Leicester have done so well to get 80 million for him
Dont worry, Liverpool bought Jota.
Leicester have done the best deal in the history of football selling Maguire for 80 million. Sometimes you're not good enuf and chances have ran out with us Utd fans.
I'm not a utd fan, but this team is rubbish!!! 😂
We got into the Champions League ..... and then we should have bought 3 world class players. Instead - nothing.
hahaha COYS!
Literally a carbon copy of Mourinho, finished 2nd which flattered the squad, didn't get backed properly in the summer to kick on. Got a half assed signing of Fred (read VdB) instead of addressing what he wanted and needed.
Neville has got the worst tash and the worst tash shaver ever
United are not a good team the only reason they got top 4 last season is because the penalties seems to be happening again this season everyone talk about bruno as if he is the goat but he has one goal from play the only reason the penalties aren’t talked about that much is because all the pundits are die hard United fans
Ed Woodward has to take a huge portion of the blame for this. He has destroyed the club. Not giving Moyes, LVG & Mourinho enough time or proper backing with transfers. If Ole goes, a new manager will get the same treatment and will probably be out the door in less than 3 years.
Man utds dressing is full of cocky little pricks that are only there for the money.Alexis Sanchez said after his first training and match they lost.Everyone was laughing and joking like teenagers messing about at school all face timing and dancing to music> Never give cocky teenagers a man's job without men around? He asked his agent to get him out ASAP because it was the most unprofessional and non positive time of his life in football
Maguire. The most expensive defender in the history of the game. The captain of Manchester United. It’s absolutely embarrassing
Who's here after 7-2 Aston Villa😂😂😂
Arguably one of the most competitive PL season ever with even the several mid table clubs bringing in significant reinforcements and we're just sitting doing nothing and just being posting on social media like everything is fine. Get Ed Woodward and the Glazer's out or see the great Manchester United die.😭😭😭
Spineless, Pathetic, Spiritless.  Nothing else to be said really
Roy Keane would have been absolutely unreal today for both games
MAGUIRE WRESTLING WITH TEAMMATES LIKE HE'S STILL IN GREECE.
Well done spurs. If it was other way round all they would be doing is praising man utd.
Things you need to learn about modern football.  Types of Goals and thier names  1.⚽- Goal 2.⚽⚽- Brace  3.⚽⚽⚽- Hat-Trick  4. ⚽⚽⚽⚽- Haul 5.⚽⚽⚽⚽⚽-glut 6.⚽⚽⚽⚽⚽⚽- Man United 7.⚽⚽⚽⚽⚽⚽⚽-Liverpool 8.⚽⚽⚽⚽⚽⚽⚽⚽ - Barcelona
this is a pure example of how sky sports is biased towards man united
The bs that ole hasnt been backed needs to stop
Maguire's roll as Captain was awful. He gave up the team gave up. Fair play to Spurs they played very well but no way will United win The EPL this year and resting your hopes on Sancho is ridiculous - Buy new defender's tomorrow or regret it
Does everything Neville said in question now Liverpool lost to Villa 7-2?
Liverpool grew soo much G. Nev that they got beaten by Villa 7-2. Nonsense talk tbh 🤣
still cant believe someone payed so much money for maguire
Gary Neville after liverpool result: 😎 we re gonna win the league
Liverpool after that 7-2🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
United had a good defence last season, this proves their heads are not in it or are Maguire and Bissaka coached bad since joining?
Crossbar can't save you every game
McGuire is should never play for Utd..Why can’t he be dropped ?? He is exposed week after week and never dropped 😆😆😆 Utd today is a joke !!
Where is the great Manchester United?  All of them play just for money and not for the club. Its make me very sad. Sir alex Ferguson please come back!!!!!!!
Tottenham offense players are under pressure  to perform...Bale is on the sidelines waiting to snatch one of their positions. No heavy players such as Bale on the manu side
How’s Ed Woodward still employed? He’s been a failure for 8 years.
Honestly I'm all for "Young" players, but this strategy doesn't work. You need your "Carrick's", "Rooneys", your older more experienced players to have stability and control. These guys don't know what they are doing. Martial, Pogba, Maguire, De Gea must be on the bench!
Hary Migure doesn’t need a partner instead Lindelof need a partner
Again and again I told you guys Man Utd need proper strong and speedy centre backs.. Almost they need to change back four
I wish Roy Keane was there so bad 😂
We need a new system. I don't like the lineup he playing it's not working
True
Who is Maguire by the way? Let him out we don't need poor defender like him he is very lazy very slowly we don't need this guy ... best start with Baily and Lendolof it's a good partnership
Need to move away from “Man U have to win the title”. They’re not going to win it for another 20 years
everyone is blaming the board but ole isn’t a good enough manager and no one on the pitch is performing anyways, jose should never have been sacked, doubtful they get a world class manager now, poch is the only option tbh
To be fair Mcquire hasn't had the worst performance by a centre back this weekend 😂🤬
Love to see Souness after that Liverpool performance
KMT KMT KMT
He is right.
I feel soory to mu pay way high amount of money to get players
Is this AFTV, LoL  All these days talking about Arsenal this Arsenal that. Karma Bitch
Tbf martial fucked the game for united
Sign arteta, his men have more conviction than these twarts...
I hope am wrong but with this performance those Magpies are gonna stick their foot up our asses
Bring back Ferdinand , vidiç , stam, Heck even heinze lol
Who is here after villa spanned 7-2 for a I hit u fam moment.
Liverpool banter club lost 7-2 LMAOOOOOOOOO
I hope they keep backing Ole
That will stop Neville from barking at least for now!
Who cares about Marcus rash Ford winning free school dinners he gets paid to play football !
Simple reason for all results. No fans to hold teams to account. Pressure on big clubs. No pressure on smaller clubs.
who's here after Liverpool lost 7-2 to Villa!?!?!
7-2. Against villa.
Roy Keane should have been there 😄 would have loved to hear what he had to say 😆
what do you expect when the club is run by people who don't actually give a crap?
Please now post Souness's reaction to Liverpool... XD
Neville has a blind spot with OGS, he's over his head and Man U need to bring in Pochettino asap
All fingers have got to be pointed at the board now not ole it’s really starting to annoy me now this club is in a deep hole and we can’t get out 🙈
These united pundits bringing up the owners problem at united what about arsenal why Stan is never debated they just enjoy and never bring the issues up
Liverpool! !!!!!!!      2:7
LIVERPOOL GROW 7'2 TALL 😂😂😂
Hope Ole stays in his job😄😂
Deserved bashing after stealing game from Brighton
Accrington Stanley who are they?... Who remembers that advert?
Evvertonnnn
It's still early season ..
What a day for both Neville and Carra....
he says they were pathetic but I saw United's lads were very active and aggressive even when it was 6-1
Get harry mcguire in a room with Patrice and Roy Keane for God sake
Meanwhile Liverpool
Wait til he gets to liverpool
U NEED A BIG NAME MANAGER  !!!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Glory glory man utd haha wt a load of bollocks
Hahaha 💙💙💙💙
Does anyone know why players are making an “A” symbol when celebrating after scoring? Have seen Chilwell, Grealish and Barkley doing it this weekend.
Edwood leave united
Maybe it's just OGS is a bit of a fraud
What If roy was there
hi all man u fans around world i advise u to stop watching man u games becoz of your healh
Aaaannddd there goes Roy Keane about to commit arson
Oh dear missing, big mistake letting Mourinho go United board..
Now u realise what Mourinho said was right. Finishing 2nd second with this team was the best - Mourinho said
villa 7 - 2 Liverpool
No worries the champions hv humiliated more its 7_2......it's was supposed to be 13 _2....where is carragher??
Total rubbish...total idiots...total nonsensical...well done 20 times league champion...  And Gary fyi...Liverpool lost 7 - 2...19 times league champion and newly crown league champion...
Can say the same with Liverpool pathetic from a Liverpool fan
But hang Mourinho just parks the bus doesn't he? Won 1-6
Love it
Who’s here after Liverpool lost seven two
Thought this was a Retro channel video. Getting a bit of a Deja Vu from this.
Mcguire is an 80m Jones/Smalling.
Imagine Sir Alex Ferguson was there.😂
Always taught maguire was overated.
Also....where is KEANS REACTION..
I never hate anyone as much as I hate Maguire
I'm a lpool fan and we just took a night off at villa but it will be a one off... Utd fans get out and protest your owners they are suckling your club dry, tens of millions on interest payments per month alone, as much as I hate utd they are our biggest rivals and they deserve better than what these players are giving. It's OK pundits saying go spend tons of money but what top top player would go to utd at the moment.... Get rid of those players now, I saw lpool slide into mediocrity now utd are doing the same.
Remember how these pundits were bashing jose when he celebrated finishing 2nd....
United fan...however, Man United got what they deserved for the way they treated Jose! Yet Jose sat calmly on the touch line has his team ran riot....Big win for Jose in more ways than one!   Well done Tottenham looking like the team Man United could have been if Jose was supported and the fickle fans had faith.......A MESSAGE TO THE SPURS FANS  DONT MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE AND KEEP JOSE AT ALL COST.
They don't like it up them....
I wonder why people are suprised about today's results, when in reality we lost 6-4 against Brighton last week.
Liverpool always gotta one up United
Liverpool got beat 7-2 and I'm a chelsea fan 😂
😂 😂 😂
Mourinho managed 82 points with a worse squad and Ole only got 66, ole is a bad manager that's it
Luke Shaw is right, we need need new players especially someone to replace him
United wont win anything
OLE SAVE YOUR JOB AND STRIP YOUR CAPT ASAP... one thing is very clear Harry is not even close to 1st team and should never be capt of this team...  overpriced English crap..... Roy Keane saying Harry should never put the shirt  on and be sold tomorrow....  what good is sancho if Harry gets 3 assists for other teams.  Disgusting is are defense.  Frank at Chelsea had the balls to bench keppa even after Chelsea spent 70.million on him. Ole needs to have the balls and bench Harry.  We don't have a capt on the field....  Bruno for capt.
Maguire has always been a fridge but now I’m thinking he’s an American fridge
Another fine mess ole
Cucking useless funts!
Why not call out ole who is way out of his depth
love it
What a day in football history
Maybe if Man U spend another billion they may qualify for the Europe League next season
Every time I hear manu and standards in one sentence I laugh
Go and ask Liverpool now how did they feel!!!
Bring in evra as backroom staff with ole
And on the other hand Liverpool just got hammed 7-2 against Aston Villa
Jose is a legend..
“Pathetic, soft, flaky, rubbish” Neville said these same words before to describe a team and now they are perfect for Man United
I bet Gary doesn’t slag off Liverpool and they let in 7 with 11 men on the pitch ! Football is just stupid you need fans out there clubs like Liverpool and Utd are used to fans maybe city will win since they have plastic fans
"not gonna get to the level of liverpool"       aston villa: Hold my BEER
Try replying to this: get him out. Can't c or feel any kind of leadership. Never was never will. Oles a baby.
Liverpool have now lost 7-2. What's happening today!😂
calm down , if we where 11 and why the red ?? they said in france if marcheal had fallen first on the first slap???
What has this weekend actually been? Spurs win 6-1 against man udt, but 7-2 for Liverpool is a disgrace. And I am sorry to every udt fan for being cocky a couple hours ago, just showed that everything can happen in football
Man U has spent so much money every season but it’s never enough
Thanks for all the coverage on how good spurs were x
Man Utd 1-6 Tottenham Aston V  7-2 Liverpool It can't get any better. 😂 😂
Lfc fan klopp leave unforgiveable thanks for the cups now off to bayern see ya pal disgrace a real manager would have stabbed Adrian at half time with a knife in his teeth like a pirate assasin
Now on to Liverpool 😔
VNL is the problem btw xD
Great analysis Gary ✌🏽
United play sh it at home, what a disgrace!
Keane should be there.  Sky are a joke
Sod Neville I wanna hear what Keane thinks
this didnt age well liverpool just got clapped 7-2 by aston villa
Loving seen the name ROY KEANE.
Over paid and underworked
Smaller clubs struggling at the same time as 80 mil on an imbecile ,  modern football for you .
lol, gary shall face to face with ole and rant him 'you are pathetic' and 'what a manager you are and look at the scores'
Until the glazers and Woodward go we will never challenge for the league. They have no ambition.🇾🇪🇾🇪🇾🇪🇾🇪🇾🇪🇾🇪🇾🇪
You think he'd be able to say Manchester..! 🤣 Where the F is Mancher??
A similarly weakened squad barcelona went down to 10 and esily won...spurs were dominating already before the red what a disaster
Just got here when Liverpool are 7 down.
Watched this before I watched the highlights...
Right lads it's just Spurs right lol No not any more tho eh. Man Utd were at the top for too long and it's left certain people unable to understand how they are no longer the club they were.
Utd are crumbling like their stadium
Ole deserves life time contract at utd.... taking them to another level!!!! Dont forget guys, utd fans thought maguire was better than van dijk 😂😂😂😂😂😂 deluded muppets
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Get Poch in please and move Woodward and Ole out
Man Utd: we are the laughing stock of the football world today.  Liverpool: hold my beer.........
And what about Liverpool😳 crazy weekend for football.....  But let's all laugh at Man United 😂
Like Ferrari total crap, Manchester United must do better.
Excellent result for any football fan outside of man utd, I love seeing utd get smashed around like that, bring on 2 weeks time. Also, we (England) should sack Maguire, he's never been up to the job. Either way, fantastic watching them get a real pasting. What an embarrassment.... Absolutely loving it.
Man Utd need DEFENDERS not them spending £100,000,000 on Jadon Sancho when they don’t need him
WHERE THE FUK IS ROY KEANE WHEN YOU NEED HIM!!!!!
wtf is this day? manu 6 - 1 spurs, watford 7 - 2 liverpool
Liverpool followed Man Utd today. We too had our worst game in years
Excuse my language but at the moment no f'n way Manchester United getting Champions League next season if no players come in tomorrow & Solskjaer still the manager by Christmas... doubt eveh get out the group stage with RB Leipzig & PSG.
Who’s here after seeing Liverpool loosing 7-2 to aston villa!!!🤡👀
I  am very said today. no defens players in mautd and they can not go top 4.
Haha had a feeling spurs would do it today, 4 to 1 winner, nice 😂😂
Makes a change seeing refs not favour man utd
things would be flying if Keane was in the studio
I was laughing at this as a Liverpool fan earlier today.... Now I am crying.
Old traford was coloured in white last night
OGS 'I suppose there's no chance of Liverpool being thrashed by Villa to take the heat of me is there?'
Were gona finish 3rd. Ole's at the wheel. Were getting sancho. Our penalty taker hops around. Can't stop fkin laughing you bunch of mugs. BANTER FC 😂😂😂💩💩💩
80 million is what you paid for Maguire!  As a Chelsea fan, Compared to Maguire, Torres seems like a great deal!
150 million what? 😂😂
Where's the Liverpool fan's
They only finished 3rd by sheer luck not cause they played good
Ha ha, let's wait until Aston villa Vs Liverpool finishes 😂
We missed out on a possible classic tonight from Roy Keane
United are the Dallas Cowboys of football
Strip Maguire of captaincy, not good enough and not a leader. Give it to Bruno or Marcus. At least they put the work in.. Feel bad for Telles or anyone coming into this mess
Just look at arteta come to arsenal have bang average players and he has squeezed a bit out of them. I'm sure if utd got poch in utd would have a bit of improvement but with ole he's just flat I wonder what donny van der beek is thinking right now
Utd are a joke
Ha liverpool got smashed today even with thiago. Worse then man u
ole out isn’t the right move we don’t need a new manager we know I’m our heart of hearts ole is right man patience is key we will be on top again
Meanwhile Liverpool getting spanked by Watkins and Grealish FFS 😂
MUFC ex players aer great talker... Take Neville as example, as coach he ruined Valencia but as a talker he is good reporter and his critical words like prime fergie LOL
Where’s Roy keane when you need him
Valencia.
De Gea stuck to the government guidelines but Adrian didn't as he let in 7 instead of 6
If good players came in, Luke Shaw would be first to warm the bench. He talks like a fan, not an ambitious player
Do you think would Roy Keane have allowed that result to happen in his playing days?
Lol now liverpool is 6-2 down to ASHTON VILLA
With this team United will get relegated mark my words lol
Anyone here that voice crack
1000 comment
Crap manager  What is the manager game tactic and plan.
😂😂😂
Maguire the 85M wrestler, he wrestles not just with the policemen but also his teammates.  I thought last season, was the season where ManU had solved their defensive personnel problem.
whats up with the mic. looking like its straight out of the 80s
Essentially Gary Neville has just said that Man U need to buy there way to victory. I'll tell you what, that's pathetic and shameful!
'the squad that they have' it cost 600 million
Meanwhile city signing Dias who looks 100 times the player maguire is already 😂
That Greek off season is still there
Even worse , United club legends are being forced to compliment Liverpool
Mourinho getting the last laugh. Should of never got sacked in the first place the club didn't have patience to keep Mourinho even though they won 2 trophies but now he is close to his best again.
Apparently Ed has increased security around his house as he finds Garys comments 'inflammatory'. Ed is a bellend. Maybe if he'd do his job properly and the Glazers invested into the club he wouldn't be worried. He is part of a cancerous business plan that takes money from a club dear to millions.
Not got a leader.....someone to shout order's out (Keane...Robson...Bruce...)......the board need to realise that they need to buy right, not BIG....
Not a penalty could save penchester United against Jose WRATH!
How can marinho go to spurs get the players he needs yet at Utd he got fk all
Edward glazers get out
Man Utd is done for
How many players they brought in What u talking about,  I think the problem is to the owners and to the board,
Marinho has transformed spurs making them fantastic
They don't need players, what they need is hunger, heart and passion to win, otherwise forget it......
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😂😂😂😂😂😂😅😂😅😅😅😅😂😅😅😂😅😂😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅
The board has ruined United. Fergie left not having the investment looking over at man city  Knowing....
Who’s watching this after liverpool’s defeat 😂😂😂 liverpools defeat has made me feel so much better as a manutd fan 😂
Shocking game
Bruno Fernandes -> Captain ! 🔴⚪️
It will be interesting to see where Utd, City and Liverpool will be in the table at the end of the season?
love how youtube cut the title off as 'Gary Neville breaks down man'. If United keep this up that'll be the actual title
HOW ABOUT GIVING SPURS SOME CREDIT FFS COYS
Arsenal has aftv after a loss, man u has skysports.
80 million pound.  Thats overrated.. could be the worst signing..
Man utd are finished and fucked defence is fucked and shambles
Ha! Hahahahaha! Wait was there another team in this game besides Man U?
Clamp the player's cars and make them walk home..... Atrocious! And make Woodward hop home
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
so when are people going to go after the board and not manager
We need roy in the dressing room.
MU needs change the defend though. But why the hell they sign cavani. Tsk tsk tsk. 😂
Patrice and Gary should be a little happier at this moment seeing the score at Villa park.  Liverpool having a nightmare.
Get Glazerr out.
👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎
im was soooo pissed off but thank you liverpool at the time of this msg they are losing to aston villa 5-1
Can't put this performance down to players not being supported. You want to see fighters in your side. Players that step up to the plate when it gets uncomfortable.  The defensive awareness and positional play today was appalling. No shape and players switching off at crucial periods in the game. A half decent defensive team today would have prevented the first four goals. There's no grit in the centre of that midfield either. Pogba swans around as though he's getting ready to walk down a cat walk. For a big lad he has no physical bite in that midfield. With Fred and Mc Tom in the game mid week at least they had bite in the side, take those two out and it becomes too powder puff with 50/50 balls nearly always being conceded. There's a along way to go with this team and there's going to be more than a few casualties along the way me thinks. They need some tough backroom men like they had with Harrison, who'll beat these players into shape or get them shipped out and replaced for ones that will take that responsibility on.
Can you imagine eric cantona is in that team?
If justice was done Maguire would still be in jail. Would be better for United. That must be the worst defender ever. They should sell this guy and buy Senesi from Feyenoord. Argentina International and best defender in the Dutch league. Costs 30 million.
But hang on Gary City drew against Leeds and Liverpool just got battered by villa.
Man Utd were using the rarely seen 'dog's back leg' defensive line.
Anyone here when it’s just gone 5-1 Villa?
edd deadwood out
The glazers is driving this loving club into a laughing stock.
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
We spent £80m on a defender that forgot how to defend but know how to defend his sister in Greece. Shambolic.
not just defence mate .worst team ever
That back line is something else... best in the world
They keep buying players and all those players get worse as soon as they wear that shirt. United is destroying players.
Gary 👍. GLAZERS OUT OUT OUT OUT OUT
Keane need to be an Assistant manager right now at United
Sky needs to get Roy Keane on the phone  !!!! I want his reaction today
ffs they need to get roy in for these man utd games asap
Gary's not wrong
Don't worry....Liverpool are currently losing 4-1 to Aston Villa
As a Chelsea fan, I guess all this shows is that the players want Ole to be fired. I mean, that's the only explanation I can come up with for this loss. No point to be salty here, it can happen to any top club, but there seems to be something not right in the dressing room at Man U and you can see and feel it on the pitch.
Let's face it. Who actually saw this coming 🤣🤣🤣
Ole should be sacked or resign tomorrow morning.   Change my mind.
How does Maguire play head tennis at the back and get let off with a general “back line was poor” statement. I’m surprised he didn’t offer a Nazi Germany circa 1941 treatment to that “Untermensch” defending.
What a day and there signing Cavali it's almost to good to be true
If I were being paid several million pounds a year to work a maximum of three hours a week, I would put my heart and soul into every second of those three hours.  I wouldn't be worrying about psychological damage, or what someone had said on Twitter, or what my club had spent on new players.  I'd get my head down and work.
The thought of a PLAYER looking around the dressing room and going "yeah nah these dudes won't do" is baffling. Morale at absolute rock bottom.
No no, he's got a point.
ole’s incompetence as well
United are bad
Reminds me of the Man City demolition years ago.
We all enjoy a utd saga brilliant content.
If Gary’s watching Liverpool play he’ll feel better
Jesse Lingard can be the next Messi
Don't worry Liverpool will win nowt
A good job Roy Keane wasn't on the panel
I love Gary on Sky Sports, but I need Roy on these games as well
Always covering for his mate ole
I bet they wish they never got rid of Jose...
I’m a Liverpool fan, but if I was Ole, after the red card and 3-1 I wouldve told the players to leave the pitch. Absolutely disgusting from the ref
Ole should be getting more ...he seems to have lost the players we know Woodward needs to be sacked.
"Ole's at the wheel".
I really feel bad for ole it's not his fault, he always tries his best
The way Leicester managed to get 80 million for a fridge with legs is the biggest mystery since the Stone Age!!!!!!!!
I would be getting Rodon in now. Make bid for Rice or Nidi . Please let Axel be fit next game. Shaw looks slow hopefully Telles will replace him. Brandon in for Biasska. Give Keane a phone call get him to join the coaching team same for Mark Bowen. Switch to back three Henderson Axel Maguire Mingi Brandon Telles McTominay Donny Bruno Rashford Greenwood.
No passion there.. problem on so many levels.. even good players are loosing confidence.. it's only when the damage is done that the incompetent board goes to the market.. well said Gary.. The team just doesn't have players with enough fighting characters there.. those who have those traits Williams and mctominay lacks the sufficient talent and those who have the talent lack that character (Pogba etc).. only Fernandes and van de beek (from the little I saw has this drive in them).. a pity Maguire is continuing on loosing confidence and becoming more and more bad with every passing game.. hopes ole start getting ruthless and stops playing favouritism and starts benching non performing stars irrespective of their salary or price.. but then again he does not have cover for replacing them.. maybe some drastic changes like converting mctominay to CB might work to bring the grit and character in defence.. but ole does not take these kind of chances or approaches.. but as we are now, I would not mind him tweaking with his players and benching some regular underperforming stars and bringing in some academy players like teden..
And anyway, with Neville as manager it would’ve been 1- 12.
Potentially €80 million for a penalty kick specialist... What a sad club !!
The worst defence I have seen in my life I am fuming as tot fans are gassing it but we brought telles and cavani
Lamela took Mourinho's advice and was a bastard!
Wasn’t that bad. I’ve seen worse. Let’s not exaggerate. Don’t make a mountain out of a mole hill.
The red card was stupid.... kinda killed the game... but yeah  man united players were/are pathetic
This is exactly what man utd deserve
"Man U need to win the title"  No they don't. They have no right. Classic entitled Man U fan who doesn't recognise they were incredibly lucky to have Sir Alex.  Nothing is a given in the Premier League.
Breaking news : Roy Keane was found in old Trafford parking lot behind maguires car
Be nice to hear a bit more about Spurs.  Long week for them but an energetic and aggressive performance.
I can’t understand why they signing midfielder Harry Maguire to play as defence for United.
just dont b an ole apologist..bring pochettino and a director of football.
Gary, United are DONE as a club.  They have spent close to a Billion pounds in transfers over the last 8 years or so, and the majority of that money has went on average/above average players with hyper inflated transfer fees. Couple that with having a team filled with young multi millionaires who want to play celebrity, being the next Brand Beckham, rather than grafting for a legacy of greatness.  If Olè, hadn't been the baby faced assassin against Bayern Munich, for Sir Fergie The Furious of Govan, he'd never have gotten the job after his Swansea performance, now that he has it, he'd never have lasted this long without that sub appearance in 99.
Martial is not a number 9 and pogba is so so bad should have been sold
I knew man u would regret firing Louis Van gal. He was building something but the man united fans where impatient and thought the team was better than they really were.
Harry maquire is so bad its not even funny. Like wtf are you doing man???
Liverpool just got a first half whooping. Down 4-1 to Aston Villa. Who knows what's going to happen in the second half?
Mourinho won the europa league with that squad Let that sink in.........
Keane rang Gary and told him what to say
Rubbish Gary, hiding behind transfers. They have been poor in all 3 games so far. Yes need a top centre half but that's not an excuse for these performances
AFTV must have changed there name to United Stand🤣😂😁
Harry Maguire has now been promoted to Lord Maguire.
Imagine if A full Fit Bale was there too then the result sheet would have been a lot worse than now.
The 1st goal mistake by Maguire was pathetic!
Captain,leader,£85mil player and he is not good enough.He probably has a good agent.Dont want to see him again  wearing the armband. I'm done
They are absolutely abysmal. Saw a comment on the BBC blaming the lack of fans in the grounds for this defeat! He said that Spurs wouldn't have got six if there had been a full crowd in Old Trafford. Absolute rubbish my friend, even with all of those southerners going to watch their beloved United, they would still have been hammered!
3:30
Why don’t he talk about ole is not capable of organizing the team, he’s not good enough he just support he’s mates ,
Only because...Alex Ferguson left.
It doesnt even matter who the manager is anymore.
Ole going to the apprentice   Ole - I managed one of the biggest teams in the world Manchester United   Alan sugar - you mean Banchester United and you broke the rule of 6 in the last game   Ole - I can explain   Alan Sugar - no need to explain the BS, Ole your fired !
Drop Maguire for the sake of the team and the sake of his confidence! He hasnt been the same since his greek tragedy
zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
De Gea sticking to government guidelines and only letting in six!
Don't worry so much Gary , Mister Pogba will post a pic on Instagram in ur memory.
Leicester City pulled off the biggest heist in history , 80 million for a fridge lmaoooo
Ole is utter rubbish, are you trying to telling Spurs defence is better than utd .. this wast Barcelona or Madrid it was spurs.. ole doesn't have a clue what he is doing.. no other top world class club would take ole as a manager .. van der beek is star player ole doesnt have a clue what to do with him. We need a top manager ..and before you say we had Jose ..yes we did and he took us to 2nd place and a Europa club .. a decent manager would do more with what squad ..sick of people saying he achieved maximum..Jose squad was nothing compared to the squad ole has ..but once again protect ole as if he is some world class manager
Blame rashford and martial as well
When his voice broke when he said ‘pounds’ sounds like when I realised we payed 80 million for Maguire 😂
Leicester must be laughing at robbing united of £85 million for slabheed
I honestly don’t know where to begin. How is our back line THAT bad. To be honest it was pretty good for most of last year, but now I’d reckon Aston villa probably have a better defense than us. Maguire isn’t good enough, but we signed him for 85 mil, so I doubt the board will replace him.
no backbone
I can't believe United have kept ole for so long, the entire squad needs replacing, including the manager.
They don’t have the stomach to say Glazers Out!
Maguire was thinking of the virus, he didn't get close to anyone, told Shaw to do the same
We'll be lucky to finish 8th.
Remember it’s only Tottenham
Sack ole get evra in
Bring back those Marcos Rojo, Phil Jones, Chris Smalling to the squad... They would have done far better job than this
I still can’t believe United spent £80 million on a fridge
Aston villa lead liverpool 4-1
What's the time?     6 past United
These former Man Utd players under Alex think United is still good. They need to wake up and accept the fact that United is no where near the United they played for. The sooner they do that the better.
The last team to beat United 1-6 were city and they went on to win the league. I am just Saying!!
It is funny that Gary Neville is saying that José Mourinho was right, but were  you not the one that said never ever again must United appoint some one that will come in with his own philosophy and change the DNA of united but where is that DNA under Ole and guess what Mourinho destroyed you today with and attacking style of play.
Looks like Liverpool want to be like Man U
The Plastics.
Gary neville you pratt
Sucks does it with regards to the Red card when it goes against you so why moan ? What about all the dead penalties that Man U were awarded last season (14 ) and this season and counting!. You bought a fridge for £80mil what do you expect ? 🤷 🤣
We need 2 CB not Sancho
Neville speakong 100% facts on 100% logic.  Then there's most of the comments.  Talking completely different things. FFS. 🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏾‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦🏿‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️
Nobody brave enough to blame olle.
Phil Jones : I’m the worst defender in the history Man .Utd  Harry Maguire : hold my Luke Shaw
The fact that EVERYONE KNOWS THIS now should call for a change
Man U is a joke
Gary, Patrice, Roy, etc....These Men were Soldiers and along with other lads during their time making Manchester United as the Best Football Club in the World. I grew Up watching these Magnificent Players who were indeed Soldiers playing with Spirit and Commitment towards their Club. Now Most Players in the Current Squad don't have that Passion and Commitment. When Sir Alex Ferguson left The Old Trafford, the club became a Laughing Booth.    If I am given a Chance to Slap, I would First Slap The Board Members starting with Woodward. Then the Sponsors.   I want OGS to show his Anger towards the Players and also to the Board.
Totally frustrated 😫😫😫😫😫😫😫
old toilet is down the toilet. sky bet league beckons. 😂
Excuses and Excuses Let just get too the fact that Ole Solskjaer is just not Good enough and that his out of his depth
The red card didn’t help Manchester United did it
After seeing 1-6 against Man City, I said to myself Martin Tyler’s words. “you’ll never see anything like this ever again! So watch it! Drink it in!”    *oh, how wrong I was.*
Might want to retract the Liverpool statements at the moment 😆
80 mil uno 🤡
Ahahahahahhahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahhahaha
And to think that you clowns thought that Mourinho was the problem when he was actually the solution LOOOOL
I wouldn’t say it was decent..
its only man utd lads
0:24  - Those be the eyes of a Vietnam Veteran.
*If Was Bayern Munich Against MU IN CHAMPIONS LEAGUE, WILL SCORE A LEAST 12 GOALS*
R.I.P man unitd
..Maguire,the biggest fraud in history of the game..😂😂😂..oh my god, what a ignorant..hilarious😂😂😂😂😂
A better stronger team beat man united.. today, as simply as that!
GLAZERS OUT!!!!!!!!  Till then nothing changes!
The problem is that people think these pundits know what they are talking about. No, they dont have an idea. They made Jose Mourinho lose his job when he was the only person who understood what was happening. Now they agree with hi???!!!
How many brain cells is it gonna take for the board to wake and realise that this United team is not premier-league winning quality.
Liverpool not better, 4:1 down to Villa after 40 minutes
Lads......it's Man United  COYS!!!!
'One team really on their game today the other very off colour'
Ed Gareth Woodward is a disgrace! OUT NOW!!!
Life's a cycle..  If you know what I mean. Stop over reacting and look for solutions.  It's okay.. It happens.. And this coming form someone who's not a utd fan.
Gary nails it yet again
Roy keanes there instead of Evra......first live murders ever on sky sports
tHEY JUST ARE SO arrogant, they can't understand that success comes in cycles. They grew fat and seem to display an idea that they have a divine right to be a the top all  the time.  It will be good for them to learn a little humility..
Who wants to even go to Utd nowadays? 😂 Liverpool’s become the biggest club in England now, wonder how that feels.
I've been saying it since they appointed Mr Bean. It's a joke. It's embarrassing.  The biggest most ridiculous thing I've seen in my 52 years is that clown as manager of Man United.  The rot starts with Woodward. Another clown. The players are a disgrace but they are coasting cause the manager is just out of his depth beyond belief.  I'm sick of hearing idiots like Neville defending Solskjaer. If he believes what he's saying then he has no place on TV.  Utter nonsense.
welp half time now ..villa livpool 4-1 x_x
Luke shaw needs replacing himself, his position play is awful
This is a game Neville would have been a part of and still got mullered. Spurs turned it up to another level
To everyone who rn is saying ole isn’t the right man sack him and get poch in. Why do you think this will work? The board has done this to 3 managers now and each time our club keeps getting worse. The problem isn’t ole it’s the glazers and Woodward, they refuse to buy players that are essential for our club to succeed and give us mediocrity. I agree that the football rn is atrocious, but just look at the work this manager has done last year and compare it to the support he’s gotten. He’s got no backing from our club and I guarantee you if he’s sacked in 2 years poch or whoever will go through this process. I don’t think ole can win us the prem but I believe he’s the right manager to bring solidity to this mess if he’s backed. In addition a correct board will make the right assessment over what manager they appoint as well as the players they buy. The correct board will make sure the players play for the badge and not for the money so pls stand by him
OLE OUT POCHETINO IN
Things I learnt from this match  1. Lamela & Martial should have got a yellow card 2. Harry Maguire is not worth 80 mill definitely not even worth 20 mil 3. Ole showed he is a very poor tactician by allowing Man U to continue playing from the back and poor management. 4. Shaw was so terrible  5. This was a record equalling defeat in Man United's Premier League history. 6. Tottenham have adopted an agressive intensive grit about them, Mourinho is doing wonders tactically and psychologically  CUDDOS TO TOTTENHAM THEY WERE THE BETTER TEAM!!!
130mil for Maguire & Bissaka.... we are crap in transfer dealings. 100mil for Sancho loading... we need to make much more smart signings.
What does Rashfords initiative have to do with Man Utd’s football? Lol
POU’NDZ
Rashford should go to a bigger club
Respect mourinho. United threw away mourinho.
The players are putting manager under the bus...like they did to Mourinho..
Speak is easy. How bout your manager career, gary?
Neville doesn't want to go anywhere near firing Oli...
Jose..return of the Jedi..
Neville's denial about Ole is disturbing.
Levelpool?? 😂 He's already tongue-tied and they haven't played Everton yet! It's not over, mate.
Its not united fault, united has been playing poorly for years, the problem was that Tottenham is playing well. And you dont want to accept it but it is thanks in large part to Maurinho these players are playing for him and the club, not for themselves.
As a Manchester United supporter I wish they lost 1-10. That would of thought the idiot Glazers and they main man Mr Woodward.
Cavani to agent : "just to confirm, I'm joining Manchester City, correct?"
How anyone can claim paul pogba as world class is beyond me. Guy is an absolute joke
I said along Moyes was if given time the man who was recommended by Fergie say no moore
It's  6 6 6  RED Devils
imagine if Roy Keane was there😳
Funny how am seeing this while aston villa is smashing liverpool 3-1 lol
Man U goals are socially distancing, 1 goal per game. Let other teams score many goals they catch Covid and we'd have the last laugh
This might the only team that Fulham end up beating all season! 😂😂💀
After crashing horribly, Ole's red bus is a complete multi-billion pound write off.
Slap um up Man.
Pundits and Experts: Man United need some CB's   Man United: WE'RE GETTING CAVANI
just tell the truth, utd are horrendous. in the boardroom and the pitch with  ole in charge
It's not ole's fault it's the board that's not letting signings happen if it was all up to ole we would have sancho upamacano and telles
Manchester United's days of being a big club are over 😂
Pogba is useless has done nothing in the time at the club, Ferguson was 100% correct about him.He just coasts through game there's no drive or determination from him he's the exact opposite of what Roy Keane was as a player.
Leeds better than scumchester
Nothing on the manager yet when Jose was manager they made it all about him
Mourinho finished second and won Europa still got axed
We cannot blame woodward for that. That was our best team from last season and they played like a sunday league players..absolute terrible performance..they should hang their heads in shame..
All these pundits talk about is how clubs need to go and spend ridiculous amounts of money. Spending big on players doesn't guarantee anything.... How much was Pogba?!, How much was McGuire?!, How much was Wan Bissaka ?! . Disgusting amounts of money, and they haven't proved their worth. The problem is their attitude.
Beisla will be available at end of season
In response to those complaining about OGS, we have had so called 'better' coaches in the last few years, how did that work out? Until the mess at director and ownership level changes, things on the pitch won't!
how is gary still backing ole, he has a strong enough team to be competing with these teams. He has no back-up plan in any game
Lamela could have killed the boy!
Its hard to get 6 penalties a game, so Penchester United lost
Maguire: " Thank god I avoided getting raped in that Greek prison"  Spurs : "Hold my soap"
Just takes one game for everyone to say Utd are awful. When Fernandes signed everyone said they would challenge for the title. Ahahahahaha
The constant making of excuses for Solsjkaer is pathetic and completely dishonest by his former team mate pundits. OGS is awful as manager and the evidence of this is how disorganized and unmotivated the team look. OGS is not good enough and he;s part of the problem as he knows he isn't any good as manager and as a result doesn't want to rock the boat properly and demand more from the board and his players because he knows he's lucked out in getting the job in the first place.
Ya......NO... This is why we been saying we need defenders and goalkeeper. We dont need Sancho or Cavani. Defensively we are not at a Premier league level, imagine the hidings we will get in europe with this type of defense, Blud... We gonna get butchered.
Such BS from Neville. 'Psychological damage' on the players for not spending enough money? You were not getting beaten by City or Pool. You were spanked by trophyless Spurs that finished 3 places below you last season and the manager you thought wasn't good enough for United.
damn where´s Keane when you need him for a laugh..
Where’s city though after spending 150 mil?
Poch is still available.
Defence is allover the place and there still talking about sancho ffs Van de Beek must be wondering what he's walked into when Paul Pogba is getting his game ahead of him. United might have finished third last season but as a United fan they didnt play that well towards the end of last season either. Fergie would have called time on some of these players along time ago it's a complete mess.
On top of everything else, roy keane is a prophet now?
ja ja ...Lo golearon al Afrikan United
Roy Keane’s probably smashed his tv
I can't believe they broke Patrice's spirit, I need a drink (liverpool just lost 7-2 guess its not so bad)
Someone go to Roy Keanes house and see what he thinks.
80 mil for Maguire LOOOOOOOOL
smht, totally embarrassing.
Hes not wrong
I'm a Doncaster Rovers fan and looking at this at a neutral perspective, I wouldn't give a rat's backside if it was 3 games into the season or 36 games, Glazers need to go, Woodward needs to go, players need to stop being brands and focus on football and Manchester United need to fix up big time and if I was Ole, I'd hand in my resignation and find another club, because he deserves better than not being backed. He needs experience as a manager in the Championship or League One, but he was thrown in there because the club had a honeymoon period. If the Glazers won't back the manager, then sell up, take the money and go, so that someone who cares about football can take over the club and put United on City and Liverpool's level
This Manchester United Team finishing 3rd was a fluke. Tottenham had a first half of season changing manager and the later half filled with injuries.   Chelsea got transfer ban and had to rely on young players. Arsenal is Arsenal.   Manchester United is no where near 3rd position.
As bad as the whole team was they had no structure. Not to mention how is Luke Shaw still a professional footballer? Zero positional awareness. Matic can't get around anymore and why is Ole still manager? Pochetino is available. As an Arsenal fan I'm buzzing no longer banter fc that title is passed down to UTD.
Sky should have rung up Keano and got him live on the line delivering an epic roasting
Maguire got slated on Talk Sport earlier for backing off for that free-kick. He only took a couple of steps back. Who was covering for him while he was guarding the kick? How long should he have stood in front of the ball while his team-mates were just mooching around? I'm not a fan of Maguire, too slow, too easily turned, but fair's fair. That was just a very good piece of play by Kane.
The problem with being ok with 3rd is when 66 points is enough for 3rd. That wasn’t progress then and isn’t now.
lollers
3 games ? Calm down!
No tactics.. We have better players than Leeds.. they put a performance than utd
Liverpool have become stronger ..........losing 2-0 to Villa lol
Hahahaha
MU IS DONE. THIS CLUB IS LITERALLY OVER. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME WATCHING THEIR PATHETIC PLAY OR MONEY BUYING THEIR MERCHANDISE. IT IS SIMPLY NOT WORTHY. GO SOMEWHERE ELSE OR DO SOMETHING ELSE. SPEND SOME TIME WITH YOUR LOVED ONES. DON'T WASTE TIME IN THIS HOPELESS TEAM. THIS CLUB IS COMPLETELY FUCKED UP, BIG TIME!
Why was the coach happy?
Maybe Mourinho, Solskjaer, and Martial arranged this result to give pressure to MU board or to give the fans legitimation to make riots and stone the Glazers to death.
A manager shouldn't be judged with how much money they've spent on players but what they have done with the players they had. I don't see any team cohesion in that squad, i don't see any tactical game plan with that squad. how does Bielsa do it with a fraction to spend but have them all give 100% every game and still play attractive, decisive football. You don't need to look back too far with united to see a great manager like SAF turn average players like brown, oshea, fletcher, gibson, welbeck into premier league winners. Football has gone down this dark hole of who can spend spend spend and buy the league. The time of nurturing and motivating players to perform there best has gone.
the MUFC owner paid a lot of money into his NFL team the Tampa bay.....look at all the stars players they got this season.....Tom Brady, Jason Paul, Rob Gronkowsky, LeSean McCoy, Ndamukong Suh.....All these guys are expensive and the team didn't really make much money......so where all the money comes from to pay all those guys?????? MANUTD maybe?????
As a United fan would like to say that what was that, what was that performance..the ppl running sry "ruining" this club should be fired, the manager should b fired the players who don't give there 100percent and that clown Woodward should b fired...u know what Mourinho was ryt when he said that achieving 2nd place with these players is a grt achievement
Son  is  GOD!
spurs win 1-6 and all sky sports do is talk about utd typical
Honestly we were confident but you lot rolled over and took it up the .......two problems with football nowadays....ppl speaking about reputations of clubs which are either too poor or too good and the obsession with spending tons of cash...and for what.....it's disappointing  even for me as a Spurs fan to see alllllllll that cash value on the pitch and they have such a poor showing.....get it together ManU or bring back Sir Alex
Legend patrice
Put Roy Keane in as manager and he’ll knock some sense into the team. Not saying he’ll succeed or do well but he’ll definitely put some sense into the squad
The most considered “rant” I’ve heard
Robbed Brighton last week and caught today... Utd will kill me
Roy Keane and Alex Ferguson both ordering a new tv right now
This is  the worst defense line in United history.HARRY is a FU..ING 80mil. JOKE.
Waah waah waah waah. Boo hoo. No divvys round here mush. Geit up.
I want to cry 😭😭😭😭
spurs battered you lot....take your beating...
Man I wish Keane was in there
People say woodwood out or it’s the boards fault but it’s not just there fault we have a manager who has had barley any experience and a defence who doesn’t even try
Make lingard captain
man stfu how many more players do you wanna bring in? spent how much on that shite defence of yours last season? world most expensive defender uno ! pathetic
To much money in football these days it’s draining the passion right out of it some of them players should hang their head in shame and welcome a wake up slap of Evra 😡🤬👋🏾🤣
Man Utd a disgrace. Shameful. Martial shouldn't be a part of this club
OLE OUT HARRY OUT SAF WON LOADS UNDER THE SAME OWNERS WHO SOEND A FORTUNE ON THIS CLUB SO BEHAVE YOUR ALL DELUSIONAL AN NOT A CLUE BOUT FOOTBALL 😂🤦🏻‍♂️
4th Goal was absolute disgraceful. Don’t know what Man U players were doing. 0-6 at home - unbelievable. Only one ☝️ word - Pathetic 😏
U are right garry
Woodward Oct 2019- ‘Ole was hired with a long term view that we will be successful. I want to take a long term view. Being distracted by short term things can be dangerous’.  W.W Oct 2020- signs 33 y/o Cavani
United has a strong enough squad to at least be competitive. Chelsea started last ss much worse, losing Hazard and getting transfer ban, lost 4-0 in their 1st game. But bounced back and played some decent football, though the results weren't always good. United has been terrible so far, outplayed by Palace and dominated by Brighton. The lack of fight is inexcusable, new signings or not
Watched all the comedies on Netflix so decided to watch the Man Utd game, it didn't disappoint - United fan here
I wait for the day Gary says the truth about Ole but I have a feeling I'm waiting in vein, Gary is very good at dodging that question scapegoating the players and the board which he has no problem being critical with.Gary be a real critic and keep the same energy across the board and yes that includes your mate.
BS! When you are behind a goal and you're penalised with an impossible red card how do you expect players to feel? spirited? understand that such decisions by a pathetic referee can blow the game up. What about the ridiculous penalty in the end?
Get Roy Keane into the locker room.
Glazers looting the club
Still waiting on Roy Keanes post match analysis 🤔
Manchester United lineup today worth more than £400 but spending another millions on players is not only the solution do they have a manager by getting the best out of the 11  tactically this season manchetser  united  not good
Manchester United need to stop living in the past
Glazers have sucked the life out of that club with the help of Woodward
Well let's get Roy Keane  in as part of the coaching staff.  Because  he wont piss about   he will sort the men out from the boys.
Why hasnt the man utd captain, harry maguire come out and explained himself or his teams performance after that game? Instead he leaves it to shaw. Some captain he is. Absolute joke
"on the shoulder of liverpool" lol - maybe on the shoulder of the road with the wheels off!
OLE OUT NOW
Fraudba getting exposed!
maguire & bailly let us down , we started off brightly  And then it was poison pogba at his consistently inconsistent best in the 2nd half
Man utd problems trickle down from senior/board management. They're either signing the wrong managers or not giving enough support to the right one they've hired. Period. Ed Woodward should just resign. He has been killing united for years.
This defence is a joke. We need to keep Smalling, start telles and drop maguire.
fergie was the glue that held UTD together, he was the only one who could stand up to the board both though success and fan support. mourinho could do it though success but fans quickly would dismissed him for doing what he had to, which gave excuses for the board and players to not support him. its hard to picture a world that UTD either gets a manager who can do what fergie did that's not mourinho, only ones left are in rival clubs. if i was ole, i wouldnt even have accepted to become the manager after his interim stint, his reputation will be like arsenes, after several seasons without a trophy, but without the initial success.
Im sick of these guys prancing around the pitch like they are worthy of the man u jersey. Disgraceful. Im sick of this. Also the board is pathetic. Where is sir alex what is going on.
Why do I keep looking at his lips
This club only has money 🤣
Get out my club. All of them.
sorry mate only 3 games in 😔 got the whole season lol
Ole looks confused from first goal. Every game he looks like he depends on luck. Take him out.
I came here to gloat :-)
Too many simple mistakes and a lack of trust at the back cost Manchester United everything. Even the red card and luck was on Eric Lamela not getting a card in that incident. Apart from that, Manchester United specially defensive coach need to sort this out.
utd are terrible😂😂all there deluded fans live in the past talking about what they won years ago💀
Gary is right for talking about psychological damage. That's what it has done to the Utd squad.  The players begged for support but we laughed at them. Unfortunately we didn't know what they were seeing.
United has become an average team with average coach and bunch of bankers as board member,
I hate the fact that he protects Ole so much. Those players are all on 100k plus a week and that is what you get. Man Utd have spent over a billion on players in the last 10yrs, what are they on about support? Ole is shite end of story.
Leave Ole out of this! It's not his fault Maguire is an idiot who can't lead. It's not his fault The Glazers, Woodward and Judge can't do crap! Once those prats leave then we can point the finger, but until then he's trying to work with what he has and with whatever little support he's getting.
Love it. ALAW MOT 💛💙
Fun fact - Tottenham will finish above Banchester United this season
Dean Henderson won’t do any better if he replaces De Gea with that defence.
Change the manager, he is clueless. He just it on the bench and did absolutely nothing. No instruction whatsoever to the players.
What a disgrace. The people who run the club don't have the best interests of the club. The players don't deserve to wear the shirt.
Hahaha, continue to talk of Arsenal FC.
OMG even Sky Sports not give Jose and Tottenham Hotspur credits.. Imagine if Jose lose they will smash him badly
Gary looks angry
Manchester united is no longer a football club but a business for glazzers not arming to win but to sack money from the club
United are finished. It will be years before they come back let's face it.
Security has been increased around Ed Woodward. Gonna need an army around him after this. Hope he and the Glazers are dealt with, one way or another
No courage no fight no balls  no interest no desire all is wat man utd was  today
I love listening to gary after United get hammered because he properly rips into them
As bad as the result was, the biggest talking point should be the cheating by Lamela. To go down like that to deliberately get a player sent off was disgraceful.
Could be back in for david moyes ha ha
What is that between his eyebrows
Yippeeeeee
I know what you’re all thinking. You wish Roy Keane was in the studio today.
neville looks about 60 after that, come to think of it i look dead and im 15 years younger
People laughed at me when I said Maguire was the problem in the defense, and not so much Lindelof (not perfect but not as much an issue as the 80m pound fridge). He has shown almost nothing as a defender and even far less as captain. Leicester are laughing their way to the bank. When we needed leadership today, he was the first one to fall. How TF is he our capitan?!!
Thank God Kean was not in the studio. As for Evra, one does not need any DNA coz Utd flow in his veins.
Boringgggggggggg
Christ .. imagine when we play PSG in the UCL😬😅
Tem contratar o técnico do RB Leipzig "Julian Nagelsmann "
We r gonna have it worse than liverpool did if things don't change quick
Breaking news: John Abraham is salty asf 😂😂😂🤣
call it how it is. board is a disgrace yes.but dont let it fool you that the fact is ole is tactically inept. so clueless lol. ole in
Disgraceful.
😂 you know when Borsis said only 6 it wasn’t a memo to united
Sky sports should go to keanes House and film his reaction 🤣🏡
NEWS FLASH YOU IDIOTS, THIS IS ON THE MANAGER! Get OLE OUT and POCH IN! When 1 or 2 players do not play well it's down to them but when the entire team is consistently being outplayed it is down to the manager.
A disgrace that ole didn’t put donny on the pitch
Manchester divided rather.
I wish the season just ended I can't bare a whole season with of lost.  From a long life united fan 😭😭😭😱🤬
I'm not even a united fan i hate united but christ it's angering seeing just how bad things have gone at that club, maguire is not fit to wear a red shirt
Sadly Rashford does need to focus on his football now.
But I thought they were gonna rule the world because they finished 3rd last season🤷‍♂️😂😂😂😂😂 fasten your seatbelts united fans the worst is yet to come
Remove Maguire from first team now , he's not a captain. He's responsible for 3 goals. I'm surprise no one seems to comment about this. Maguire need to be sold fast ! He's a fraud!
At 3:30 Gary Neville says “pounds” and it sounds like he’s about to start crying.
united still need winger and striker? lol
Maguire is crapppp, look at yourself before u start judging arsenal united. Happy with this, shut ur mouths.
00:26 damn look at this eyes hahaha he's so fed up with this team lmaoo
Woodward & Glazers OUT
Honestly. Stop paying Manchester United  merchandise that is the only way glazers out
They need a defender imo
Very true
COYS 🔥🔥🔥💥💥💥
Every true United fan feels Evra's pain. I swear he would have bawled if he wasn't in the studio
My people it’s just the start of the season     Wait till they go against Everton, Liverpool, or Man City hell even Leeds considering how they playing lmfao GOTTEEEMM. LIVERPOOL ALL DAY
Salute to a true fan. I am an Arsenal fan, but seeing someone passionate about his club this way gives me shivers.
Gary Neville is right! United were a shambles!
From Vidic and Ferdinand to Maguire and Bailly biggest downgrade I've ever seen
Man Utd defence of Wan Bissaka, Eric Bailly, Harry Maguire and Luke Shaw cost a total of £175M..
Well done Tottenham Hotspurwe Destroyed Manchester United at Old Trafford come on you spurs
i wann her riy kean please bring roy please
Woodward delayed the signing to save the salary money... And this will end up with Ole getting sacked
Women’s United 😂😂😂👌
Ed Woodward out, who chases a player for 6 months and can’t even get close to getting the player sitting at a table? No wonder klopp didn’t wanna be a manager for this club, his even smarter then he turned out to be.
Needs to be sold simple as will never grow
It’s because phil jones didn’t play
Great seeing the Man U pundits crying like babies.....we have had to suffer so much crap when they are winning!
Why the *** u guyz are giving so much time to Manu, I mean sours and Jose just made a history here. Respect
If I was Sancho I would not want to go there... Literally a downgrade compared to Dortmund. Those stup** bankers killed our club... I can't believe what I watched today...
I guess the club is OK where they are as long as they are still making the money
Very true
This interview reminds me of Everton beating them 4-0
* 1-6
No leadership in the board. No leadership in the management. No leadership between the players. Those fans that visited Woodward last season, should visit him again.
It's only a game🤣
Please respect ✊ Pogba worldclass
😝😝😝😝😝😝🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕NICE!!!!!!!! MONG-(NOT) UNITED!!!!!... AND, THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE WON AT BRIGHTON?!! GET IN, LAH!!!!!! 😂😂😂OOH! MY RIBS HURT!!!) 🤪🤪🤪
Is this United or Cardiff? They look the same now
So spot on!
The dead bubsy babes could defend better 😂
Like sir Alex once to said"ABSOLUTE DISGRACE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Can't believe people are using United's off the field problems as an excuse for how bad they were today. For example, Wigan Athletic went in administration in July towards the end of the season. Instead of giving up and feeling sorry for themselves because of the problems off the field, Wigan went and thrashed Hull City 8-0, only lost 1 put of their last 8 games and only got relegated due to a points deduction
I guess Jose morihnio was right when he said Everton has more ambitions than united
That’s the problem Neville never criticises Maguire
The hangover from Ferguson leaving is still as strong as ever! I don’t think anyone goes to Old Trafford now and fears it
I now understand why people call Maguire a fridge, coz his head is completely empty. Who wrestles with teammates 🤷🏻‍♂️
I don't support MAN U but they must... Stop buying WRONG PLAYERS.
They should all hand their wages back, or give them to charity. Absolute disgrace. This club is broken.
As a spurs fan ive had so many batterings to endure from man u ..so im going to enjoy this until no doubt we get beat by west ham!!!
Harry Maguire is basically a white version of Titus Bramble
If Oles at the wheel, he should be arrested for drink driving
united are going down
At least not as humiliating as 8-2
Roy keane said he would be swinging at De Gea and Maguire when they were loosing at half time....i fear they may now be dead 🤣
Gareth is back to Spurs..  bring back CR7 to the theatre of dreams pls.  Last not the least let Messi come in to Cityzens.
David moyes is haunting the hallways of United like a scooby doo ghost.. joke club
It's quite obvious man United has no ambition.... the only thing they care about is money
Paul Pogba The worst most talented player in The history of The sport.
LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL
After the interview, Gary is hiding back to his underground cave.
The united players are mentally very weak, one thing goes wrong and their heads drop. Pathetic fc.
Please put as many ex utd players as pundit. this is a joy to watch
Get rid of Ed Woodward
Harry maguire doesn’t deserve to be the captain
Livepool signed no one last summer and won the league. Gary Neville loves to avoid criticism of Ole.
If evra got this pissed off imagine the scenes if keane was in the studio
Gary wanted us to sign Maguire. Just putting that one out there.
We only need to replace Maguire and Shaw  Bailly saved us today !!!
Congrats to Leipzig and PSG for going to the round of 16 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
I feel bad for Gary , Evra, Roy etc who played at a time where they were biggest in world, now see one big joke of a club, terrible board and bad recruiting, screaming for improvement each year but nothing
Graheme is enjoying this!
Jose must be laughing
Same players so threw mourinho under the bus  Same players who will do the same thing to Ole  Roy Keane said it and we didn't believe him  Look what's happening
It's only Spurs! :D
Play station game .....
100%, blame for the state of the club lies with Glazers and Woodward who couldn't give 2 s***ts what happens on the pitch as long as they get their UCL payday in, absolute parasites of the club
Id love to see Neville analyse Harry “Slabhead” Maguire performance today 🧐 absolute shocking £80 mil down the sewer
Poch is waiting
Even without the signing we shouldn’t be getting slapped up 6-1  No leaders at club we have a fridge as a captain the club is messed and 8,9 years ago this team was amazing
😂
Tbf that was probably United’s best performance of the season
We knew we'd have to score more than one to win as Man Utd always get their customary penalty against us. So to get 6 was a bonus. The joke in London yesterday was that Man Utd had already been given a penalty.
I wish premier league would excuse us to play 2 goal keepers instead of 4 defenders ffs
Loving the pain.
What a pass by Højbjerg for the Aurier goal. A bargain at £15m. A club going out and getting the player that they need.
You got no fans
please interview some more ex players this is golden, im loving it! try get someone actually crying!
The fact Mourinho came to old Trafford and did that is embarrassing
Man united is a joke team  Their  important defender is Harry maguire  When Liverpool have Virgil Van dijk
no one gonna talk about gary's voice crack
Oooooooooooooooooo
Maguire is OVERRATED!!!!!!!!!!! IDGAF!!!!!!!!!
liverpool sign players ? who ? tsimikas ? ok ...  thiago ? u bought van de beek ... so its  one one about newcomers. its only your tragedy when you buying  van de beek who you ABSOLUTELY DONT need .. but i hope OGS is not sacked during winter bc we need good laughs at  meme united.
I feel sorry for the person handing out the P45s at Old Trafford. They will have their work cut out this week.
I never take pride in anyone's or anythings downfall..except shitty United!! Absolute joke club since sir Alex left... an honestly.. I love it
COYS!! Y'all said Mourinho was finished, watch it, he's just getting started. Bring on that coach who's gonna win more than Mou won for that United with a shambolic club structure. Atrocious!
Games were so obviously fixed for them last season and it shows this season
Evra is a Joker
Get Roy Keane on now
Kevin Keegan, wherever you are I hope you’re enjoying this as much as I am
Keano would have got thrown in jail if he was at the studio.
Pulled out on van gall 😂
Don’t cry Gary
Where's John Abraham? The biggest Man Utd clown
Don't worry, guys! Jadon Sancho will sign tomorrow and that one player will fix all of our problems, it's not like we need defenders or anything is it? Let's spend 110 million on one player and he'll win us the league!
on a serious note, this has been going for 7 years now, why do we expect something different every year? why dont we just accept united are a midtable to 5th 6th club at best, since fergie went, 7th,4th,5th,6th,2nd,6th,3rd. thats an average of about 5th. why are we suprised? this is just what united are now, a europa league club, get used to it, enjoy it, and enjoy watching liverpool win another title, #21 is on its way next year.
Graem out there drinking his water minding his own business 2:18
Why do they keep bringing up the great work young Rashford has done iff the pitch? It's like they're trying to use that to hide the fact that Utd are terrible.
And it's the players fault let's not say it's the managers
This can only serve as a springboard for the players to step up their performances.
Not the first time they have lost 6-1😂🔵🔵
Capitulation: the action of ceasing to resist an opponent or demand.
“pOuNdS”
Maguire is no different to our Kepa😂😂
3 Videos released on this. None about Spurs... (Edit) now 4
COYS.
Such a painful game to watch
👍👍
Arent you still gonna back ur old pal Ole, Gary?
Even if United manages to recruit the 2/3 more players they desperately crave, it's going to take time to integrate them into the team, by when half the season would already have been gone & the league position will be in dire straits! We're paying the price for a lack, or next to no pre-season, & it's impossible to have a go at so many players who are underperforning, & so it's now about trying to get 'em back to their best levels ASAP!
Pathetic,overpaid bunch!!
Roy Keane 😡😡😡
Absolutely hilarious. Couldnt happen to a bigger bunch of c**ts.
Keep them coming Sky I'm enjoying this 😂😂😂
Come On U Spurs
thank goodness roy keane wasn't there for whatever reason..... man utd became evrythng they once mocked about
Where's Roy keane
United fans : “We’re a big club cause we sell a lot of jerseys.” Big eh?
Good to see united suffer ☺️ cause they always look down on man city 😹
united are back gary!
Sky really missed out on one when they didn’t announce Roy Keane as one of the pundits
Wish keane was there just to see him go mad
NO sulking. NO excuses.  NO complaints.  NO point in mulling over a defeat.  We were absolutely battered, but we are the Red Devils and we will bounce back.  GGMU!!!! On to the next👹
Sign Sunny Bhasin
The board is crap, the manager is crap, and the players don’t want to be there. United are absolutely dreadful
Maguire has to be the worst signing in football history 😂
They should be happy they didn't face Liverpool's gegenpressing
Still not willing to blame his mate Gollum?!
The worst defense line in the whole history of Man United.
Wish Roy Keane was there 🤣🤣
I'm a Barca fan but this hurts me also.Cant imagine the pain man United fans feeling right now.
Patrice was ready to slap everyone up in that studio. I dont blame him.
Man U were lucky to finish 3rd last season.
at least de gea stuck to government guidelines and only let 6 in.
Not as pathetic as Chelsea..
what else can man united do except scoring penalties?
Sky not giving enough credit to spurs. They were completely written out as always but after that Everton loss, this team has been sensational. Then you add the fact that Bale is coming after international break, as well as Vinicius and possibly Skriniar, this is very very positive going forward for Tottenham.
Will go down as one of Man United's worst performance this season, unless they do worse.
He’s not wrong
Harry Maguire is a massive clown
Absolutely shocking, credit to spurs
Imagine if roy keane was there...
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAH
6-1 is the new 8-2 😂😂
They did G Nev dirty with that thumbnail😳
I think that was pathetic - Gary Neville since 2013
Incoming Pogba abuse.
Men against boys right Evra?
Im a united fan and this club is finshed
john abraham the joke man better not showup
hahhahahahhahahahahahahhahahahahahhahahahahaha
