F Canada don't come to USA we don't like are you booing are anthem wtf is yours go away on your ice skates 😘🇧🇷🇩🇪🇱🇺🇺🇲🇬🇷😁
The CONCACAF Women's Gold Cup should *NEVER* be played on a pitch as sodden as this!
Meanwhile in Paris, the USWNT won their fifth Olympic gold medal while the Canada WNT were sent packing without a medal after losing another penalty shootout to Germany.
Quinn is a man.
when did they start playing soccer in swamps?
❤

if this was a men’s match there is no doubt in my mind that it would have been canceled. absolutely unplayable conditions
This is football ⚽
Alyssa Naeher, the mf United States secretary of defense for the WIN!! 👏👏👏
Go USA Go! Love my team from San Antonio,tx! Red ,white and blue for ever!
Awful field conditions
unlucky 4 canada
Terrible call from the referee to create the overtime in the first place…the right team prevailed USA 🙏🏼⚽️❤️
That’s a bad penalty call at the end of the game like that… the ball was completely cleared when they collided. It didn’t affect her shot or attempt at a shot… just refs controlling the game in every sport like they always do.
Another exciting chapter in the USWNT vs. Canada WNT rivalry was written.   I won't be surprised if the USWNT and Canada WNT meet somewhere in Paris 2024.
Quinn is not a woman
It's such slow pace , and they all suck at crossing, extremely boring. I watched it for 3 min, and it's just ugly womans Futbol!
Anyone else notice how all of Naehers saved penaltys were in the exact same place
Man I’m sorry but Brazil 🇧🇷 it’s not a  easy team     NAEHER she’s a badass goalie The girls are playing 🇺🇸good    But I’m prying for this girls  to lift up that trophy 🏆.    I feel bad for my other part 🇲🇽 but I’m in  let’s do it
Women soccer sucks boring I swear 👎
Trump 2024!!
Too many anti Americans, usa needs to repent of their feminism
They have not yet learned to do PK's, there's an simple art of using your eye's and approach to stricking the ball as well as not being one dimensional as far as you using your dominant side to hit the ball, learning to strike the ball with your left and right foot equally is a must.
This makes me believe, that Borat on his national anthem ever said " *All Other Country's Are run by little girls* ".  😁
conditions were a joke... game should not have been played
a professional player knows, or should know,  how to temper their talent, speed,  passing prowess defending  when there are adverse playing condition.  the pitch is what it is, both teams have to play on it thus giving neither an advantage- as the final, (regulation time) showed
The worst penalties by Canada lol
Lindsay Horan needs to head the ball better and the United States National Soccer team need  to defend better in the Concacaf Women's Gold Cup
The Canada PK at the death was bogus - IMO
US goal keeper, is he a man??
WHAT AFRIGGIN GAME (that should have never started)!!
Just like she saved the penalty against sweden. What a boss.
USA 🇺🇸 always have the best goalkeepers ❤!
Sophia is so clutch. We really missed her in the WC.
Rose lavelle stand out there with two defenders head back passing to Sofia smith,,its a good play,,
Jaedyn Shaw and rose lavelle has a good chemistry on this game match
I don't agree with the penalty call. The keeper was looking at the ball, and although she didn't get it, it's not a foul, IMO, and the yellow card is a joke.
Grreat match ^_^
Sofia played it safe with the softest kick ever. We all know why
The art of catching pk kicks isn’t rocket science just go toward the same side as the kicking leg bc over 70 percents of kickers do that.
Well played by the goalie.  Still question this Women’s team. Game should have been won in regulation.   They have a lot of talent. I just question if they still have that drive that previous teams had the last decade or so.  I get they want to win, everyone does. But I question if they want to win more than other teams and whether they are willing to put in just that extra amount to see themselves back on top of the world.
What a lucky win, the Canadians deserve better... Lucky first goal, and a goalie that tried to murder the Canadian player gets a yellow instead of the deserved red and suspension. I remember when we used to dominate, I wonder if we will ever be one of the top 10 countries in the world, now that we got crushed by Mexico and Canada even though the ref gave the game to the US, we are not a top two in North America 🤣
Cringe lol. TBH. If you watch men’s football
Fell asleep the whole game not even lying
Why schedule the😅games during rainy season.
I have a little bit more respect for these women playing in shitty conditions like this. That's what sets the athletes apart, by how well you can preform in any environment.
Now lets watch the US lose in the final
The US would have lost the game if it wasn't for the help from a puddle of water
horrible pitch to play on.
Canada and US always an exciting match up.
Alphonso Davies fucked up lol
Glad  the thumbnail did not give it away but what a nail biter! Congrats USA!!!
That was not a penalty goalie got there before player and player was going forward
*That wasn't a penalty.  In fact, the Canadian player was at fault.  The question is as follows: Can a player touch the goalkeeper in the small area?  Article number 12 states "The goalkeeperper cannot be hit when she already has possession of the ball or with the ball in her hands or between her hand and the surface, or when she touches it with any part of her hands or arms or with the ball in the open and extended hand or when she bounces the ball on the ground or throws it in the air."*
Why was this game played in the first place?  It isn't water polo...
GK of the year?   Those penalties were atrocious by Canada, except the one who went top corner.    For an international player to not be able to get close to the lower corner, or be able to ouch the ball to  lose to side net is just a joke.    My 15 year old girls hit better penalties than this
Women's Day everywhere In sports 🎉
In what world is that a penalty? It was hit out of bounds. There’s no chance she gets the ball back. Ref helping out Canada 😂
Why did they allow them play in such a wet field. it caused the goal
This game should not have been played. Still, Shaw, Smith, and MVP Naeher, et. al. deserve the win. Good job ladies.
I'm always against the anti-America team. I was hoping they were going to lose. They hate America, I wish we could find a team that doesn't hate the hard-working people of America. I would cheer them on regardless.
That's what I call game MVP. Fucking awesome goalkeeping from Naeher. She should be wearing the captain armband going forward.
IMO field conditions were ok to play. Your shoes get soggy, but both teams adjusted well to slow passes eventually. Ref had to call PK as keeper never touched ball and yet took out the canadian player. Good game overall. Sorry someone had to lose.
Canada 🇨🇦 just kept going left on those penalties🤦🏻‍♂️
Terrible penalty call
Our goalie is the goat!! She’s amazing!!
Let's be real. You have to draw the line when it comes to the condition of the pitch. No EPL game would be played in those conditions. There are limits. You can't even play a halfway decent game on a field like that. Should have been delayed or postponed until the grounds people could have sorted it out a bit more. That's just common sense (and I'm a neutral). I can only imagine what the reaction would have been had the US team lost. Countless articles out there questioning why the game went ahead. I'm not surprised!
I'm still strying to figure out why lady GaGa # 19 😆 🤣 😂 is playing for the Canadian team.
Why aren't Sophia Smith and Rose Lavelle starting? Coming back from injury? Out of form?
Congratulations Team USA Thanks for the hard work
Naeher came through clutch! Great game!
Amazing finish.
Alyssa Naeher is one of the best goalkeepers of all time what a Legend and athlete and person she is!!! Truly fun to watch and USA will always own Canada lets freaking go Ladies Congrats 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Go Naeher! Who was our player who missed her spot kick?
What a game! On BOTH sides  how frustrating to play in these conditions, knowing that nothing is going as it should. Passes literally stop, the way you run on the pitch, your socks heavy and wet, let alone the boots, not losing focus and finding ways to adapt. Canada fought till the very end, and fought well. Smith with a clutch goal, Leon nailing it in a very nerve wracking penalty that I’m sure put her on the spot, The penalty stoppages from Naeher… with all the circumstances I applaud both of these teams for fighting through and giving us soccer fans one amazing nailbitting game! Bravo ladies
Awful pk's. Smh 😊
Only 15,000 for a home game is sad lol. I can't believe they really think equal pay protests should be taken seriously lol.   Just sad....
Naeher....heroic....all 22 players....I have played in those conditions with the old school leather balls in Ecuador and the Philippines....not fun. That being said, Tiffany should NOT be starting, and as long as she is more concerned with "megging" the defenders instead of playing forward, maybe not be playing at all. And what happened to the ferocious high pressure that we used to play? We have the young talent to do it, and veterans that can teach them, but we have just quit! And with 20-plus minutes left to play we start killing time in the corners instead of attacking? We might as well have asked Canada to tie up the score. We have lost our courage and attacking mentality. Can't wait to see what our new manager will do. I give Twyla credit for at least having the mental flexibility and courage to not start Sophia Smith after the Mexico debacle. BTW, Sophia and Tiffany should NEVER play forward together. Ever.
the water from the field really added a intensity to the game- truly incredible :)
The goalie of the tournament!
The ref gave that gave to the USWNT, nonweistion about it, I wonder how big her kickback was..?
What horrible call for the ref, that goalie was gone for the ball that was some bullshit..!
Katia Itzel is the prettiest ref in Concacaf.
I'm always amazed how quick the uploads are. This game took forever and everything after the Sophia goal felt like a fever dream.
I could be wrong, but in the rear angle view of the Naeher foul that lead to the PK, it looks like the ball changes course off her hands before the Canadian player gets it. I'm not entirely sure that was a valid penalty.
This is why nobody watches women's soccer except women . My 8 year old boys teams know where to put the ball in a penalty. There is no excuse to put 3 balls in the same reach of the keeper. The ball should always be put out of reach either side to side or corner to corner. NEVER put the ball in the middle. These "players" know better and still gave the keeper the ball. There is an evident difference of skill, strength, conditioning, etc. from men's soccer to this. The US didn't deserve to win and Canada deserved to lose. Don't blame the wet pitch. Both teams played horrible. This is why they don't sell out stadiums and never will.
Horrible pk from Canada all to one side
Poor PKs by Canada, but that doesn't take from Naeher's three saves and one PK. Gee, wonder who was player of the game.
Terrible shootout for Canada, US goalie came out big but should’ve been sent to the showers instead of getting a yellow card
The goalie!!! 🇺🇸 also great assistance from the water to score the 1st USA goal
I think that's one of the best PK series from a goalie I've ever seen
referee decision was unfair for plenty
Wow exciting game, but the US definitely looks shaky, but they pulled through. Some redemption for Sophia Smith on her penalty kick from the World Cup.
I’m Canadian & I’m not even upset about this result. Alyssa Naeher is a beast & you just have to admire watching her
Camera angle makes the pks look 30m away
Three of Canada’s shootout shots were at the exact same spot.  They looked like they never practiced a shootout before.  Odd game.  The weather of course cost Canada the first goal.  Just bad luck.  They earned their first goal.  Dominated for long periods.  USWNT couldn’t make a throw in without giving the ball away.  Water on the field caused misery for both teams.  The USWNT tried to play defense and run the clock out.  Didn’t work, although considering the conditions not a bad plan.  I think US will beat Brazil.
That first goal cracks me  Up.....  Blocked by water
Terrible Penalty call at the end.  Should've never gone to Penalties.
Alyssa Naeher is a freakin’ beast
Great job in your water polo game today!
USWNT vs Brazil should be an exciting matchup!
I wonder how game can be start at a such terrible field with so much water😢
a travesty that this game was not postponed.
It’s great to see Alyssa get some shine!
Naeher for president 2024
San Diego demolished a historic stadium to build this crappy field.
Omg I love Naehers Facial expressions  She alwasy looks worried but shes a Beast!!! 🫶️🇺🇲️
This commentators...were they never children? Come on!! It's fun to play futbol in the snow and rain!
can we take a moment to say, keep winning Team USA, it keep the anti fake woke crowd out. i see no post from that peanut gallery.
What a game!!
YAYAAAAAAA I LOVE ALISSA NAYHERRR
*The Old Glory is proud of her daughters who make up the USWNT.  Alyssa Naeher is the player of the game again.  She is a legend in her own lifetime.*
Alyssa Naeher is one of the best goalkeepers of all time what a Legend and athlete and person she is!!! Truly fun to watch and USA will always own Canada lets freaking go Ladies Congrats 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸👏👏👏👏
This is why women will never officiate the middle in men's leagues in america.   The are truly clueless and don't understand the game,  giving that penalty to Canada at the end is abysmal
Water polo soccer
Don't know how a punch to the chops is not a red?
Great goalkeeping, horrific pk's. If Messi can miss a pk, then anyone can.
I don’t get why the Canadians keep kicking the ball at the goalie 🤦🏻‍♂️
I read about the match this morning and am just watching the highlights now. Why TF did they play on this pitch? Dangerous and stupid. It's nice to see CONCACAF W is just as much of a total shitshow as CONCACAF M is...
How can anyone defend the pathetic penalties that Canada took? ANY high school goalie could have saved those. They were horrible. Is that really the best Canada has to offer? LOL.
Goalie of the freaking year. Those PKs were such a mood.
the water from the field really added a intensity to the game- truly incredible :)

Jeez. Those Canadians need to work on pks
News for all the Naeher fans.  She’s a poor goalkeeper.  All the tools, none of the decision making.  OT was completely avoidable if she punches that ball.
Great Final coming up against Brasil, very happy for Sophia Smith! and about those PKs, I can't believe the Canadians missed to the same area, the right of Naehr, a carbon copy delivery for the thre saves, nobody told them "hey how about going to the other side!"
❤ watching Rose Lavelle, great pass on USA second goal
What a comical first goal.
Lame...  How on Earth can anybody miss a PK?  The goal is the size of a 2 car garage and any save is just luck.  Stupidest way to decide a game, but that's soccer.
Probably the worst set of pens I’ve ever seen taken holy…
How did they allow this game to be play in pond-like conditions? This is a disgrace to soccer.
I swear to God, 30% of the goals at the women's game are due to poor decisions and fullbacks passing along the backline or back to the keeper. I coached American Highschool soccer and never saw this much horrible play at the high school level. These are top-flight pros? if this was my high school team last thing I'd yell with these field conditions: "Just clear off the back line!" and right after that:; "dump the ball into the box area more, it's going to stick and do more unusual things to help the offense." Atrocious.
What kind of panel kick is this? The goalkeeper just came out to block the ball. The U.S. almost got into big trouble with the ridiculous refereeing. This is a clear mistake...Wow, the American goalkeeper looks exactly like Oliver Kahn in Germany. Let's go to the US finals championship
that penalty call is terrible. meager is totally wothin her right to do that she did. awful call
That checking penalty seemed pretty sketchy to me.
I’m Canadian & I’m not even upset about this result. Alyssa Naeher is a beast & you just have to admire watching her
difficult penalty call
This game was a really good game I wanted Canada to be the Victoria's it's always always more hungry is going to be the winner 🏆
Never forget God loves you and is our lord and savior
soccer...not football
Wow. What a great game. Go, Jayden Shaw and USWNT.
Love the Lord, your God, with all your heart, soul, mind and strength, and love your neighbor as yourself, Jesus said. And to turn from sin and follow Me ❤️📖nkjv 🧎🏻‍♂️🙏😑🕊🇺🇸🕊 🏆⚽️🏆⚽️🏆⚽️🏆⚽️ 🙌
Jess Fleming and Adriana Leon put this Canada squad on their shoulders and should be proud. In different conditions we may have seen a different outcome. Congrats to Smith and Naeher for amazing showings!
There are 3 memes we need ASAP. From the Colombia game: - Alex’s “C’MON!!” - Trinity’s “BACK UP!!” And from last night: - Trinity’s body surf!
Such poor penalty shots by Canadians. Almost straight at the goalkeeper. Really poor
Whoever built this stadium should be ashamed of themselves...everything is so tight in this stadium and the worst part is building the pitch without the design of absorbing and draining systems...what a sham!  Credit to both teams for the great match and congrats to the US team on the win although they could have scored more goals in 2nd half of the extra time if they didn't start wasting time with 10 minutes to go!
Are we sure the USA keeper isn’t a dude?
Ridiculous field conditions for this level of play.
the water from the field really added a intensity to the game- truly incredible :)
No one cares about women’s sports. The American team are an embarrassment to their country.
Alyssa Neaher is a great goalie.  But all three of those penalties were absolutely horrendous.

What a game! On BOTH sides 👏🏼 how frustrating to play in these conditions, knowing that nothing is going as it should.

Great instincts by Jaedyn to not give up on that back pass to the keeper
GK is a superstar!
That pitch was an abomination
Was this on turf or real grass? I can’t tell
These are no conditions to play futbol.
Alyssa Naeher 🙌🙌🙌
Great performance for Alyssa Naeher. But let's be honest. those saved PKs were really poorly taken. Even my 3-year-old girl would have done better.
I Really like how the USA's goal keeper worked on the semifinal game agiast Canada.
Canada put 2 more penalties in the exact spot Naeher saved one.  Not a great idea.
🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
What a wet and wild game that was 😅🤩
I'm always amazed how quick the uploads are. This game took forever and everything after the Sophia goal felt like a fever dream.
Mataron al tigre y le tuvieron miedo al cuero las canadienses
They almost go home ...they got .lucky... I bet they will not win their next game for  sure hahahaha
Hats off to these players for putting up with that bs. I cannot believe they expected this game to go on in such useless conditions. Totally unprofessional to put the players in that position. That said, they all handled it very well and gave us a game of a lifetime.
Wow this game really should not have been played. That water on the field is crazy. Good job Naeher, but perhaps Canada didn't study. Three shots same spot. Yikes.  Let's go against Brazil!
Morgan has been overrated these past couple of years. Not sure y she is in the starting 11
like playing football in a rice paddy!
Naeher made up for the bad challenge to allow it to go to PKs. Though honestly those were some pretty bad penalties from Canada.
Both USA and Canada are woke liberal political activists I wish they could have both lost.
don't approach the ball so straight peeps
this is what locked in looks like
USA team is not is not good enough to be champion off the world I love this team The two center half is not covering each other and left and right back is not covering center half the header that scores were is two center half this team is not playing together as one
I watch better played soccer in my over 30 league. Such boring football. No one except lesbians and pervs care for this.
Has anyone noticed that as the USWNT has gotten less white the more conservatives criticize them.
What's more boring then Soccer ?   Answer: Women's Soccer !  But don't worry, Men will soon be taking over your sport once Biden is re-elected.   LOL !!!
why did canada hit all their penalty kicks in the same exact spot?
SHAME on the refs for exposing the players to injuries with the field being under those flooded conditions.
And a referee  from usa taking care of mexico 😂😂😂 what piece of 💩😂
Best of luck 🇺🇲🤝🇧🇷
It wouldn't be a USWNT vs CanWNT showdown without drama now would it?
Ridiculous to play soccer in a lake. Glad USA got the win. But stupid not to call this game unplayable.
Now's the time for USA to choose the next gen Women's team ... they can't keep depending on the veterans !! They have so much young talent to choose from ! To win the 5th World Cup !
Clearly a penalty on Naeher, she was lucky it wasn't also a red card.  She needed one half step more and to punch the ball, not the player.  Canada needs to practice their PK's, those were truly terrible.  A real shame such an important game was played in those conditions.
Amazing disrespect to not have a playable pitch. Concacaf is at fault.
Spoiler! PKs are hard, but the 3 Canada missed were not placed well at all.
Where is the highlight of the controversial penalty incident that Canada didn't get in the 49th minute?
How about Adriana Leon equalizing in extra time with mud all over her face? Women are so badass. Great game and go USA!!!!
Wow the first goal seriously come on this is not fair for both sides
They shouldn’t of played during these conditions
Canada needs to practice penalties the 3 saves were hit close to the goalie with no power
Terrible Conditions. They should not have played in those conditions.
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉 USA!!!
A few players on Canada look like beauty models, like #19. Holy
Soccer sucks
The pitch was the MVP
Bruh Canada's PKS were worse than England's in the Euro finals. There's no way someone told them to go left for 3/4 kicks 😂
People were complaining about the weather in that LAFC v RSL match in the snow but the wet grass like this is far less playable than the snowy grass.
WTF kind of field is this?  No proper drainage at all?  Where did they play this, at my local community college?
Canada woman players team so stupid the US goalkeeper  catch only one side of penalty
Just lucky
Alyssa Naeher is absolutely goated
The game shouldn't have been played at all. They couldn't even pass the ball - terrible conditions...
Those penalties were atrocious.. no shot power and too in the center.. I think it was more of the low quality of the PKs than the goalie .
To be honest, they kept shooting in the same position so it was easier to be read and blocked. That's on Canada's fault. Same thing happened with Cape Verde vs South africa in which Cape Verde kept kicking to the same position 3 times.
Terrible terrible penalties. No shape, no run up no power. Looks like they have just started kicking a ball. Any GK with hands would have saved all of those.
absolutely horrible field conditions led to that first US goal- so much water! Regardless, Canadian defender should have followed through with her back pass
You’ve been Naehered Canada! 🇺🇸🫶🏻😎💪🏼🐐
Well congrats to my spotted gals of the U.S.A..  But to the gals of the Maple Leaf you future is truly BRIGHT.  I can't wait to see how it plays out for your Ladies of the Red & White.
Hope there is no water in the final
If she doesn’t win the top goalkeeper I ain’t wanna hear it
I wish I could've been there, but they said it was sold out.
So we have another THRILLER GAME LAST NIGHT folks!!!!      Rain rain rain!  Sorry ladies, you have to play water game this time!     It wrecks havoc for both sides, it was luck for one bad for other!😩     The referee decided that ball to Canada, but many believe it should go the other way around!!!👍. Naeher clearly was with the ball first a fraction of the second so   the penalty should be on Canada not US!       Alyssa Naeher “ has quietly proven herself again “.    She made one pk herself and saved many for USWNT to go on to the FINAL on Sunday!!!🌹🌹🌹     Congratulations Miss Twaila Kilgore as the team go on to FINAL!  You and the team HAVE EARNED IT!!!!  Go team USA!!!🌹💖⚽️🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸👍🤩
Why did the Canada 🇨🇦 girls pick the same spot every time 🤦🏾‍♀️
Absolutely atrocious PKs by Canada.
Naeher came through clutch! Great game!
Jesus our goalie has a look of steel
The first goal goes to the field tho wth
Awful canada penalties...😂
Naeher is a beast goalie.
That field is just criminal. If there was any more water here they'd be playing waterpolo and not soccer.
stopped watching after the first goal - shameful conditions
Damn! Only if I stayed up until 2am 😔
Amazing finish.
What a game!  Another one that will go down in the lore of Canada vs USWNT. Never miss a game between these 2 teams man, they never disappoint.
@ 9:27, Laurence #10 should have gotten a yellow card for harassing Naeher.  This is the kind of official negligence that leads to the UGLY game.
wow what a game!! amazing game for both and Alyssa Naeher she's an Beast!! wow!! USA!!!!
Match should've been suspended in the 1st half. Unplayable, unwatchable. But credit the US for adapting and finding a way. Naeher more than redeemed herself for the error to concede the stoppage time PK. (And thanks, Canada, for some pathetically placed PKs.) We move.
first of all. They should have never played this game with that field condition.......
The game should have been postponed, the pitch is a mini lake.
Canada could not win even with a man? 😂
No question that US keeper saved but those were very poorly taken penalties by Canadians
Reading the bounce of the ball under water, is a whole different skills❤
Playing in the rain is the best weather for futbol
imo this is ridiculous. we wouldn't put 10 year olds through that, much less the women's national team
Terrible Canadian penalties.
Let's go Brazil
This commentary is awful. Sounds like hockey. I will continue to watch on espn deportes even though I don’t understand a thing they’re saying 😂 oh, and let’s not risk these ladies playing on pitches like this. It was disturbing to watch
Hope who??? 😅
Teams are a 10.  Commentators 0....they are terrible. Wow. Too much talking.
Trolls in the comments.  😂😂😂😂
That last penalty was bs. She played the ball and hit the ball.
This field is unplayable, the US should be embarrassed to let this go on.
Canada needs to practice PK.
Like I said before Naher is a savage
Well done USA ladies. Canada fought back.
Survived crooked refs who tried to rob us yet again.
I don’t think I’ve ever simultaneously cussed and cheered so much during a game: Cussing that a new stadium had no adequate drainage system, cheering that it helped the US’ first goal, cussing that Shaw was left out of the 2nd half, cheering that Smith was back in good scoring form, cussing that Naeher got a penalty at the last second, cheering that she scored & saved 3, cussing that Kilgore let an inexperienced player take a PK, and cheering that the others made theirs! 🫣😃
Best game I have seen in a long time, wow! This game in the water soaked field was ridiculous, what a game. Naeher did a fantastic job. She shut down Canada with a vengeance. Can't weight fir Sunday. Please, please NO RAIN!!!!!
Canada is washed up. Lol
This game should not have been played, the conditions of the pitch literally effected the outcome of the game. It’s not the fact it rained it’s the fact they chose a stadium with inadequate drainage
I hate VAR
Three failed penalties shot at the same spot :facepalm: Good for the keeper though.
Ref was no bueno. Inconsistent.
A performance for the ages by Alyssa Naeher.
Note to CONCACAF: Don’t play the game with a field that saturated. That was a joke.
Goalie decided to go to her right side on all the PK's, she was lucky this time.
This weather condition was not the right one for this kind of matchs..in the end USA still USA in fem soccer... Congra's
absolute shame that they were forced to play on in these conditions. Entertaining nonetheless, but the first half was like schoolyard football. Would have loved to see these teams go at it for real.
Torneos arreglados de EEUU , para EEUU, hasta los ciegos se dan cuenta,
What a game whooo Lets Go USA 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Offside wasn't called. Home court advantage.
Too bad the conditions on the field were atrocious. Both teams deserved better.
NaeHER is HER!!!!! She was pissed off 😂🤣😂 I wouldn’t wanna be in her path when she’s mad 😂
Those were some weak sauce penalties by Canada, clearly the nerves got to them cuz those were easy saves, not taking anything away from naeher though 👌
It is a shame to play a game under this condition.  The officials must be penalized
This was a disgrace of a game that should have never been played due to the field conditions. We all got robbed of a good game with good players.
Those where terrible pk by Canada
Dumb game...unfair to both sides...
I’m seeing comments about the style of play being poor. Good golly people. Players on both teams asked for the game to be stopped because the field was unplayable. Neither team could play any kind of style except direct and in the air.  This was not a test of soccer. Just take it for what is was: a slog.  We are lucky no one got hurt.
That field is so bad. Why'd they play?
Look, I'm happy the U.S. won and all but this game should have not been played! That was a joke
Canada was ill papered on paneity kicks. 😨😨😭😭
This game was funny to watch in the first half the ladies had no chance at passing or moving with the ball
That Field 😮🙄
Canada was terrible at PKs you see the GK for the USA wants to dive to her right side everytime.. all had to do was place to her left side and she won’t even attempt a save.
It’s great to see Alyssa get some shine!
Horseshit Pk, shouldn’t have went to kicks from the mark. They had to add spice to it. It was 50/50 ply on the ball
That was so slick of Jaedyn lol she surprised the hell out of Kailen😄😄    Man Alyssa Naeher had ice in her veins during those PKs...Canada hit a brick wall🧱
Terrible penalty quality. Naeher made the same save 3x 😂
Nah no way this game should have been played on this field. This is terrible.
absolutely pathetic field conditions. They honestly should be ashamed of the venue. That first goal. How awful.
Poor back pass??? No way. This pitch was unplayable. 😂
What kind of pitch is this Jesus terrible conditions
This usa team is the worst I have. seen,  Missing to many opportunities.
Alyssa motherflipping Naeher! Holy hell
United States team needs to change its style of game against Brazil to possession the ball otherwise will lose. Against Canada last night US players kept sending the ball in the sky which resulted in continuous pressure and attacks from Canadian players. USA team needs to utilize its talent wings to cross balls inside the box to score goals
The late game tactics were  so stupid. It's like the "prevent defense" in football. It fails more times than not. They should have been trying to score instead of running out the clock. It was a huge mistake not to try and pressure Canada's goal with 15+ minutes left in the game. The U.S. got lucky.
These Canadian women are gorgeous
What a fucking pathetic field. Such a disgrace to the game and to an international tournament
I love Lavelle, but she should NEVER win a header over you 😂 shambolic defending
US goalie is phenomenal. Always focused and poised. She made several world class saves against Colombia.
That game should not have been played in those conditions. If it was men, it would have been suspended. It’s a joke.
Ball never lies
What a game 🔥🔥🔥
They shouldn’t have gotten that penalty to tie because there was only 1 minute and not 6
First half full of of non-highlights. Poor editing.
If there are two cultures that relish the opportunity to play in those conditions it’s definitely the Americans and Canadians. Both winners in my opinion but only one moves on.
Why the hell they allowed this game to happen. The field was terrible
USA USA USA!!!!
No one talk about the nonsense penalty? The goalkeeper was hit by the Canadian player when she try to catch the ball, also, the Canadian touch the ball first prior to the contact, and goalkeeper has priority inside the box. It’s should be free kick by US.
*Nice job!*
Watching this game live had me feeling so annoyed. I understand being tired, but settling for two goals and trying to hold the ball in the corner for the last 10 minutes just shows lack of fight
It would have been nice to watch this game without a subscription service. Instead, my cable provider showed a women's hockey game.  The ref should have postponed this game, glad no one got hurt.
O Canada fall to USA again
Did they stand like Americans for the anthem???? Will not watch until they do.
The game should have been rescheduled due to the conidtions on the field.
Ya lo avían programado cuál era la final 😢
No sirven para narrar los partidos
Ese tiro de penal de Canada hasta yo mismo lo atranco, despacio y a las manos  de la portera  de Estados Unidos
All the missed PKs were sent to the same spot. Horrible kicks
Great game. And stop complaining about the water on the field.  It's not more dangerous and shows a whole different aspect of the game.  USWNT stepped up to the occasion GREAT FOR THEM!!
Man that field looks terrible.
semi final match with so many empty seats, i guess not much interest in women's games lol
Pitch was a disaster. Ridiculous to see these world class athletes have to play on that quagmire.  😡
US should’ve never scored that first goal. Of course they didn’t call off the game due to pitch conditions.. they had the advantage. Should be embarrassed to score a goal like that
Now they have to face  Brazil.  Brazil is going to win easily.  😅
Great guts by both teams, but I laughed for 3 minutes when Naher saved the last PK.  I could not believe Fleming placed the ball at the exact same place where Naher had just saved two prior shots.  I think nerves got the better of Canada in the shoot out.  The US showed a mental toughness even after the PK shot going over the bar.  Naher’s PK was the best. Her shot is overpowering.
From a non-footballer, please explain the penalty on the US goalkeeper?? Doesn’t she have just as much right to the ball as the Canadian player?🤷‍♂️
!!! 💐🕊️ WE GOING TO GET OUR GOLDEN CUP 🏆 GO FOR SISTERS WE GET THIS THANK YOU LADY'S....USA..USA..👏👏👏👏 USA...USA ...USA....🕊️💐 !!!   🤠
the uswnt’s reign is DONE forever.. while they were fighting for equal pay, the whole world caught up. They’ll get destroyed by Brazil unfortunately. I don’t think they’ll ever recover thanks to the rules and laws and mediocre system. They got lucky for decades the world slept on it
Not for nothing but Naeher guessed the same way every PK the whole game Canada made it easy.
very happy for Smith ... especially with the PK!
Those Canadians so naive missed the PKs kicking them to the side the GK was going to dive at every one. Without force and direction. Basically a pass to the goalie 🙈
Canada played toe to toe. The conditions favoured the USA in the first goal. But a goal is a goal. Of the Canadian goal, what can be said ? How many times have we seen Ashley Lawrence pass on a dime to someone in the six yards line and result in a goal. PSG, Chelsea have been the beneficiaries , many times. The USA second goal was good combination and opportunism of the US Players. The penalty decision was fairly awarded to Canada. Leon never seems to miss scoring a goal when she has the chance. But then Alyssa, came into her own. The Canadians couldn't put it past her after that. Alyssa Naeher, show. Well done USA for coming through and beating the holders of the Olympic Trophy. All the best against Brazil.
Nah replay this game. That first goal was horrendous. Not even a bad back pass just literally stuck in the mud lmao
how many chances does Horan need to head the ball on goal?
did the US play all their games in pajamas?
Interesting game : they have good level and we enjoyed the tournament.
Usa got Lucky
From the first few minutes - it’s embarrassing and degrading they were forced to play on this field in those conditions
Seemed like canada had no experience in high level game penalties like usa did when they narrowly lost to sweden to var goal, good 2 see they worked on their pks.
Naeher deserves a call up for eternity simply for PKs.
The commentator. I can’t.
They shouldn't  play in that field
Those Pk's sucked from canada
Start Jane Campbell.
Scary part after watching both semi games is I don’t see a path where USWNT can beat Brazil 😢
Bro can we take a moment to appreciate that ref bro she was bad asf 😂..nahh all jokes aside I can’t believe they let them play under those conditions to begin with shame on them for making em play in that wet field
Game should of never been played on that field
Those were terrible penalties…
Whats up with Canadas coach. Is she even coaching or just taking the Canadian teams money. How about practicing penalties. Those players that failed the shots should open an OF account. Clearly thier in the wrong profession.
US got stream rolled by Mexico and they struggled against Canada. Yeah, Brazil is going to easily win against the US.
Naeher's mental toughness after allowing Canada to tie the game with seconds left then turn around and be lights out during PKs is amazing
I’m still screamingggg. LFG!!!! 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🥇🥇🥇🥇🥇💥💥💥🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
Legendary game makes lore
Not to take credit away from Naeher (she’s amazing) but those Canadian players did terrible with the PKs. I’ve seen better PKs taken by elementary school players.
Love the Jaedyn Shaw goal. The Canadian player hesitated when the ball sputtered and slowed. Jaedyn never let up.
God awful penalties. 🤮
YAY! I WAS SO SCARED BUT WE WON!!!!!!!
this is how soccer needs to be played, wet and dirty. 10/10 will watch again.
Such young teams!
The level of entertainment provided by these women tonight is truly remarkable.  Faced with unplayable conditions, they somehow managed to produce an absolute thriller.
120+ penalty was a joke. Glad the USA won this one.
Canada should sue the water stopping the ball. Lol
I think that's one of the best PK series from a goalie I've ever seen
wasn't that 2nd US goal Offsides and not called?
time to fire Canadian coach. #DragOfWater #GrassAndGround
Conditions were bad but the US has got to press and close in reg time. I hope Naeher and Smith have quieted some of the naysayers. They came through tonight. I knew that Naeher would ace her kick!
Love when these teams play each other. Field conditions to start this game looked terrible. Its a disservice to the players they had to play in that.
WITTTTY!
😂
Sophia Smith scored and made a penalty. Alex Morgan stans in shambles right now.
It’s not about USA goalkeeper’s ability to save penalties, Canada are simply horrible at penalties tonight
Alyssa Naehar showed up like a boss to put this away.
I was at that game ❤
Awful penalty kicking from Canada.  Three in the exact same spot that the US goalkeeper saved.
Hope Solo was a lot better. Stop uplifting this trash GK
Alyssa was the monster that won the game--when's the last time she made a goal (PK or otherwise)? Or the last time a USWNT goalie made a goal?  Anyone knows?  I didn't like the call that gave her a yellow in addition to a PK equalizer.  Still, good on Canada for coming back twice in such terrible field conditions.  We kinda got lucky on the first goal when it was clearly the water that gave us the chance.
Omg I love Naehers Facial expressions 😂 She alwasy looks worried but shes a Beast!!! 😎🔥💪🫶💯🇺🇲⚽️❤️🤍💙
Why TF would they kick all the penalties to the lowest % spot?  Canada has some real dummies lol Hopefully the US takes the gold in the final
Go USA 🇺🇸 👍
After last appearance sorry csnt stand usent let's go anybody but them. Really ni desire to watch them. Hope Brazil beats them.
the water on the field makes the game is completely different. It is more like tennis when they play on different surface.  Lets go USA. The goalie is the MVP
We all know this was bullshit, the US goalkeeper should have been sent off but of course that wasn’t gonna happen because it’s the US. And of course, the goalkeeper that should’ve gotten send off end up making all the difference in the pk shoot out.  Also mark my words. Brazil the best team in the tournament and the team that has been extremely good throughout. The tournament is gonna play the their worst game  on purpose in the final. This is going to  happen because there is no way in hell that United States is going to lose the final, even if it means fucking brazil over. And no one is gonna let  a team from South America win a tournament from North America, especially beating the United States, the most overrated team in female football.
4:57 Rose-Leon-Lawrence-Huitema was the BEST sequence of the match and 6:47 Lavelle with the AOTY Assist of the Year thus far ;-)
I'm not sure I agree with the PK awarded to Canada; but great job by Naeher and the USWNT with the PK's in OT.
Easy work for Brazil
Too much drama to give this to Brazil 🇧🇷
Brazil vs Us will be wild!! I think we all know who will win
So many damn things to take away from this game: -Unplayable conditions from this game with the soggy field where we see the ball just skidding most of the time and passes unbearable -Shaw and Smith's incredible goals just for Canada to keep finding an equalizer, and not to mention SOPHIA SMITH's COMEBACK GOALS AFTER THE WC??? Deserved🔥 -Canada's (quite literally) LAST SECOND PK during overtime from Naeher's yellow card -NAEHER SAVING THREE PKS AND SCORING ONE HERSELF???  This whole game was truly surreal and I'm so glad the USWNT is getting their flare back up again. I can't wait for the final game vs Brazil and can't get over how Naeher carried the US's win tonight. WHAT A GAME
Naeher is the old lady of the team now. And she played like it. A pillar of experience and poise in the right time and came in clutch when they needed her.
On a dry field USA would lose
Can we take a moment to appreciate Alyssa Naeher. The last ten mins of the game was the best highlight. Her goalie game has definitely stepped up to another level. Goalie of the year please!!!! She is the GOD of PKs.
People are going to say this is the Alyssa Naeher game and rightfully so. But Sophia Smith's performance should not go unnoticed. For her to score the goal in ET and then again in PKs is a sigh of relief for her. Really hoping this will get her confidence completely back for her international career.
Not "single-handedly," "single-footedly."
They set mexico up to loose
could you not show the winning team celebrating in EVERY thumbnail? it is such an obvious giveaway if we miss the match. would be great if you could mix it up a little. just a thought, thanks!
Man, that first goal was so brutal. The ball just stopped from the water buildup.
The first goal should not count it’s not fair but corruption it is what it is 😂
It's going to take me a couple hours for my blood pressure to come down enough to sleep after that game!  This is why I advocate to my daughter playing whistle to whistle! None of this killing time play. US should have worked on making one more goal before just toying with the ball the last 15 minutes! But Naeher is a BEAST
Is it possible for once to not show the winner in the thumbnail?
Three of Canada’s shootout shots were at the exact same spot.  They looked like they never practiced a shootout before.  Odd game.  The weather of course cost Canada the first goal.  Just bad luck.  They earned their first goal.  Dominated for long periods.  USWNT couldn’t make a throw in without giving the ball away.  Water on the field caused misery for both teams.  The USWNT tried to play defense and run the clock out.  Didn’t work, although considering the conditions not a bad plan.  I think US will beat Brazil.
Jesus loves you-!!
A 13 years old team would beat any of these two. At such profesional level a penalty kick can’t be taken that bad. Nothing to be cheerful about. Those two teams are bad
Go Ladies Go Ladies Go!! Got 🇧🇷 in the Final!! Let’s grab this title!!! 🇺🇸 🇺🇸 🇺🇸
This game was such a disappointment, BUT NOT THE PLAYER'S FAULT but the rain. it had the potential to be a great game, so we have to wait to see where Canada and the US stand at this time on their development for the Olympics.
Alyssa Naeher is OUR GOAT 🐐🐐🐐also Canada's PK in LITERALLY the last second of extended time was crazy. With the unplayable conditions too this whole game was unforgettable 😮‍💨😮‍💨
Wow exciting game, but the US definitely looks shaky, but they pulled through. Some redemption for Sophia Smith on her penalty kick from the World Cup.
Congrats to the US Women's Water Polo team!!!
Glad Alyssa can shut the haters up! 💪 She's proven once again that she comes big when it matters the most! Show them why you're the #1 keeper for the NT 🤙Congrats! She's definitely in top 5 best keepers in the world
Can someone in U.S. Soccer please fire Twila immediately!?  I can still feel Vlatko's aura when she's coaching!!  Naeher's had her tenure, it's Casey Murphy's time!!  Uh-Oh!!  & they're gonna face Brazil in the Final...
They shouldn't have been on that field. Could've injured players! Next thing..I know we have to have better talent in this country!! I'm not seeing anything special from this team n Brazil will kill this team come finals!! Emma Hayes needs to get here now!!!
*Give Uncle naeher her flowers already. Damn she is good. Good for Lindsey, Sophia, and Alyssa who made their pks. Damn this game had more heart racing. I’m literally not tired anymore😂. This has to be the most best moment in uswnt concacaf history.*
I’ll have to say the player of the game was the water!!! Let’s give it up for the water! 👏lol
I spent the first 30 minutes or so of this game thoroughly frustrated with the referees and commissioner for not postponing this game. The field conditions were so poor, and with the Olympics coming up, such a unfair thing to do to both teams to put the players at risk for injury. In addition, it completely changed the game play for both teams—who did well to adjust to what they had to work with. The teams truly showed that they were were willing to work through adversity. As an advocate for women’s sports, they should not have had to deal with this. It took away the beautiful game we loved and kept fans from enjoying that style of play. On the other hand, they sure made it exciting enough to keep people entertained. What a nail-biter it turned out to be.
Can anyone find out if Adriana Leon had a shot blocked in the 111th minute?
not hope solo yet but shes fighting smith stepped up rodman was growing but her emotions win like horan remember long ago when u played for fun for the love of the game wild Fantasy now for real #toomuchto lose smh
Alyssa Naeher is a freakin’ beast 🙌🏽
Those PKs were taken sooooo poorly…
Naeher came through in the clutch tonight. No doubt about it.  But that pitch....well, let's just be thankful that there were no ACL/MCL tears as a result of this game.  Why did they even run the match on a field with walking water pools all over?! Just an unreal shameful display from CONCACAF.
I love Alyssa Naeher 💕🥹 she’s my hero
the us goalkeeper was determined to redeem herself after canada scored the pk equalizer
I turned off the game after like 25 mins bc the water on the pitch was unbearable to watch. Feel pretty silly for it now
Damn I just know that Sophia smith felt SO good about that PK after the World Cup 🥹👏
Best🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
I’m so dumb lol I was so tired and I thought the game was OVER at the 105 mark, only to realize later that it was in fact NOT OVER.  So I’m happy to see these highlights of what I apparently missed. Also go Alyssa
Canada  lost the game because players didn't wear the bras.....
Better clean it up vs Brazil
Poor PKs by Canada, but that doesn't take from Naeher's three saves and one PK. Gee, wonder who was player of the game.  😆
the water from the field really added a intensity to the game- truly incredible :)
Leadership is fuking up and taking control to finish it yourself
Because USA that's why! 💪🏼
I'm always amazed how quick the uploads are. This game took forever and everything after the Sophia goal felt like a fever dream.
Goalie of the freaking year. Those PKs were such a mood.
USA in finals 🎉
USA and Brazil….who…would…have…ever….guessed …. Nothing new in fútbol …same teams making it to the end as usual
