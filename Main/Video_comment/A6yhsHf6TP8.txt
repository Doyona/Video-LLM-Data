Cost of Oil and gas drilling is increasing rapidly.
Iraqi civilians watching this video in silence...... Also the government
w saudi
JP Morgan coined the term fossil fuel to add a sense of scarcity making people believe it’s dinosaur bones. When in reality oil is the second most abundant resource next to water. It’s also technically renewable as it’s generated by the earth’s core, granted it’d take thousands of years to renew. We’ve only used oil like water the last 200 years, it won’t be a problem in the next 10 lifetimes. But we definitely should diversify energy sources for many reasons, over dependence on something that can collapse if shit hits the fan is never wise.
Even with all of these changes in the kingdom, it rings hollow to me. All of these things are just cosmetic changes, not a true reformation of the country, which means that people are not going to just start flocking to Saudi Arabia to go on vacation. If you want to go somewhere hot with a great coastline that provides outdoor fun I can think of many other places that people will go to instead of Saudi Arabia. Spain, Portugal, Brazil, the South of France, Hawaii, Florida, California, Mexico (maybe), Greece, Turkey, Goa, Cyprus, and Italy are all places that people will go to before they'll go to Saudi Arabia because they will feel safer because they know the laws and customs in those countries. Saudi Arabia has a bad reputation with many people for valid reasons.
You didn't mention this in your video, but it is important. In addition to all of the sports teams and leagues they have invested in, WWE was the first sport/entertainment that made a deal to host a special annual show called 'The Crown Jewel' and, earlier this year, they also came to an agreement to host a special upcoming WrestleMania in 2027 I think. I think that they're expanding it to three nights from the previous two that they started like a decade ago or something.
It's humorous that a lot of the businesses that the PIF has invested in are against Islam, according to their own Wahabbist Mullahs.
well in your video you're clearly targeting the royal family and the kingdom and you're not achieving anything by accusing us of the human rights abuses because we don't abuse and our country is one of the most successful countries in the world, and saudi isn't a cow that should pump oil to fulfill you're country's economy because I bet the inflation is doing it's job there, I don't like your content so a big dislike to you.
3:24 we have 15% taxes
Invest in tourism, AI, tech, gold, silver, copper, REEs, Bitcoin. long term be ballin
1:21 why is it written “شيخ"? That’s a UAE thing❤️
Oil will still be used forever, only demand will reduce. But even the next century demand will still be relatively okay, think of it like demand will go back to 1960s level, not as crazy as 2020s but still next century countries will still make decent money from oil.
As long as the people continue to practice Islam and have 0 tolerance for any other religion they will always be a authoritarian backwards country were nobody wants to live and it’s citizens are forced to stay and practice Islam or be put to death. I don’t know why we trade with them.
1:11 bro thats the prince and future king, Why would he watch this??
يلي في التعليقات على بالهم السعودية مثل بلدهم كلام بدون افعال مايدرون ان السعوديه انهت نصف المشاريع ويمكن تقدم الرؤية الى ٢٠٢٨ وضعهم مثير لشفقه المهم لا تشق راس ولي العهد عشان لا اجي اشق خرقك يا خكري
Sorry but i think dude is obsessed with the qatar deer thing png cus i see it every video 😅
15:46 this info is not correct BTW
الله لا يسامحك لا دنيا ولا آخره على التشويه
I think we should stop using oil before it runs out
As a Muslim, Saudi Arabia is on its way to getting cooked. Our prophet basically said this hundred of years ago.
Stupid people. (Saudis)
16:18
I for one will not visit so long as I have to cover myself in a tarp. Only rich people can go there & actually enjoy themselves. Repressive religious states are dangerous.
Ngl as an immigrant living in Saudi people think that "oh you're being abused by the system" and what not...bro I enjoyed a free education, a low crime rate here ,and many more luxuries I wouldn't be able to afford outside of Saudi, or course there is cons to everything but God's mercy yall I don't care what you think if ya can come here to Saudi Arabia just come and take a visit ,  Because honestly— I really enjoyed Saudi Arabia the most of all the countries I lived in,  I plan to move out back to my home country sure ,but listen ,Saudi Arabia is like any other government ,except unlike america and some other countries— the government does care about their citizens here , and even non citizens from my testimony
The Line was already downscaled by 98%. It will be a very short line. But still of unnecessary size for a skyscraper. And still more expensive than what would be reasonable for the Saudis to spend. And huge waste of resources, enormous emissions of CO2 from all the concrete and uncomfrotable to live in (you would spend most of the time standing in lines for elevators). The transportation will aslo be extremely vulnerable due to the only one subway line which doesn't allow for bypass in case of an accident.  Not mentioning the absurd idea of the mirror surface.
can you make a video about why qatar spent 300 billion on their world cup in 2022 and only made back a couple billion from tourism
another thing is they cant make another dubai cuz there is demand for only 1 Dubai
There’s no such thing as the end of the oil era this is the second holiest liquid in human history after semen all industries stem from it and it’s always in demand I remember when European countries failed to give up diesel and Trump was absolutely thrilled I’m grateful that we’re floating on oceans of oil beneath us..  we are eternal !

16:19 Bullshit, saudi education system is ranked 32 in the world gabon is ranked about 130, i dont know where you get your info, probably stereotypes lol
16:24 That’s FALSE. Saudi literacy is ~97%, kids get ~17 years of schooling, and it ranks 37th on the UN Human Development Index. Canada is ahead, sure, but Saudi is nowhere near Gabon’s level which is 108th. I get you want to make a point but you failed miserably

06:13 Did i see a podrace going on inside that mukaab building or what? 🤣😂
We will thrive while you keep barking. Typical jealousy 😂
Dawg what happened to the old thumbnail that was better
Man I wish it turns out good or something
I lived in Saudi Arabia for 12 years. It's a wonderful country with tremendous potential and capabilities. However, education and a culture of production are very low in this country. As you said, most citizens are government workers, and the rest of the work is done by foreigners. I believe the country should shift to heavy industry and establish lathe workshops in colleges and plumbing and carpentry workshops in schools. A revolution should be launched in the traditional education system, reducing the number of classes from 12 to 9, and eliminating the weak American secular curriculum. But the biggest mistake is to move toward secularism and abandon moral and social values ​​for tourists. This will bring moral corruption to the country and a bad reputation among Muslim countries. Also, there is a major problem with citizenship and nationality in Saudi Arabia, which is that you cannot obtain Saudi citizenship. There is also a difference in rights between an Arab citizen with Saudi citizenship and a non-Saudi Arab citizen, even if they are both from the same tribe. This is also due to the system of slavery for foreign workers. I believe the government should distribute citizenships among Arabs from neighboring countries and establish a unified state for all Arabs. I do not even rule out the idea of ​​expanding the country's territory and annexing other Arab countries or establishing an Arab economic or military union.
Human rights abuses? Compared to what the US and Israel are doing domestically and around the world, i would say that's laughable, i haven't even mentioned what the UK did in their colonial past.  it's like comparing a rice grain to a melon.
"I may be one of the first economies to escape the petro-state curse."  Norway escaped it beautifully. (But yeah, you said "one of the first," I guess that counts 😅)
I’m proud to say that my pronouns are K/S/A
U sound jealous
5:40 everything is made in china❌ Everything is made in Saudi✅
This doomsaying has been said about Saudi Arabia since the 80s, 40 years later nothing significant has changed. Delusional.
4:50 that’s my university 😂 PMU is officially ranked among the top 2% of universities worldwide, placing it in the global elite and making it one of the best universities in the world. It is still considered a young university (opened in 2006) but gives better education than many US universities.
The video mixes facts with exaggerations. Yes, the IEA has said peak oil demand could arrive between 2028 and the 2030s, but oil will remain a cornerstone of the global economy well beyond that, not only for fuel but for petrochemicals, plastics, fertilizers, and pharmaceuticals. Even the IEA itself admits that oil consumption will not disappear, only plateau.  Saudi Arabia does not fear this future the way the video suggests. The Kingdom can produce oil at around 4 dollars a barrel, making it one of the cheapest and most competitive suppliers on earth. Countries with higher production costs will be forced out of the market first, not Saudi Arabia. Claims that Saudi is “dreading” the future are misleading.  It is correct that about 40 percent of Saudi GDP and the majority of government revenue come from oil, but Vision 2030 is not “overhyped desperation.” The PIF manages over 700 billion dollars in assets, investing in tech, aviation, sports, entertainment, tourism, and renewable energy worldwide. Saudi Arabia is already the largest investor in renewable energy in the Middle East, building some of the world’s biggest solar and wind projects.  Gigaprojects like NEOM, Qiddiya, and the Jeddah Tower are not vanity projects alone, but part of a larger economic diversification plan. Tourism is a major focus, with a goal of 100 million annual visitors by 2030, and international sports investments are aimed at branding, revenue, and job creation. The country already hosted millions of tourists in 2023 outside of religious visitors, proving the growth is real.  The video leaves out that Saudi Arabia is becoming a global logistics hub, investing in ports, shipping, and aviation to connect Asia, Europe, and Africa. It also ignores the rapid growth in mining, defense industries, and digital technologies inside the Kingdom.  So while it is true Saudi Arabia faces challenges in moving away from oil, the portrayal of Vision 2030 as a gamble built on desperation is misleading. The reality is that Saudi Arabia is one of the only oil states actively planning, investing trillions, and building the infrastructure for a post-oil economy. Whether it fully succeeds will take time, but the scale, seriousness, and resources are unmatched.
throw shit at the wall and see what sticks
If I was the prince MBS, I would invest the huge money in US treasury bonds, Euro bonds and other safe investments, stock of various multinational companies and infrastructure projects over the world. With $200 B a year over 30 years (sum of $6 Trillion dollar), you can get 2-3% interests forever after inflation deduction, which means $120-180 B a year, enough to compensate loss of oil revenue in the future.
lol @ the switch from Saudi's social contract's collapse to War thunder ad
Look, they are much more efficient than most republics, and many projects will get completed. Although, clearly, there are much better options.
They are so cooked they might as well gamble it
They are so cooked they might as well gamble it
MBS? The same name as the leader of the F.I.A
Load of bullshit
The reality is that the Saudi dictatorship is just now mart enough to achieve this goal. The Saudi dictator is more interested in clinging to power and squandering billions on ego projects.
Awful video  Don't waste your time  Trust me
15:35 "whyyyyy" men said
It is disrespectful to change the words on the Saudi flag it is important (on the camel)
Yeah they will fail. It seems pretty clear that they don't know what they're doing
Peak oil at 2030?  It depends how old you are, I'm pretty sure peak oil was in the 90's too.  Reminds me of "climate change" vibes lol.
Hey woke peeps. Stop driving your car and burning oil if you don’t like the fact that this country still treats women as second class citizens. They still have honor k il lings, when women don’t do what they’re supposed to do. Do the right thing and rebel against use of oil
1:08  WHAT IS MORE VALUABLE ART OR LIFE
18:51 SPONSORED GARBAGE POLICE
OIL IS DEAD HAJJA IS FUEL MIDDLE EAST IS FULL
Wait didn't these guys do 9/11?
"this country where people barely could make a shelter, someday would make skyscraper" a wise man
So when people stop buying saudi oil during the next stock market crash their entire country is going to implode and none of the projects that they started are going to be finished. Stock prices are already massively inflated the last thing we need is pumping oil money into it.
Saudia arabia will be finee, they will transform the desert into a oasis if they have to
You fell for the propaganda of oil scarcity. This entire video is pointless
5:16
Just throwing this tid bit of info out there. It was already estimated in the 70’s & 80’s that there was about 50 years of oil left & the same answer is being said today. Oil won’t be gone for at least over 100 years, even longer if the west distances itself from saudi oil as then less people interested would mean more for them but in the end, this wouldn’t be good for saudi either.
I hate these pretentious economy videos
Cringe
mfs will do ANYTHING but follow a state-directed and state-protected export-based economic growth model that uses the influx of wealth gained through increasingly specialized and advanced industrial exports to fuel the creation of a domestic consumer-based market economy safeguarded by a strong public-private partnership and expansive social safety net 🙄pov MBS when he actually has to do his job and use the power scope and wealth of his state to pursue developmentalist policy instead of using it to throw money at lavish and pointless megaprojects that will crumble and collapse by the end of the century 🙅‍♀🙅🙅‍♂
Yes, can't wait to take my next vacation in a theocratic monarchy
Most stupid video.  20-30 years ago they said oil would drain out in 10 years. That was 30 years ago....
thanks for drawing Mexico as an axolotl it is very cute
People are so jealous and triggered that the 't*rroist muslims' have money 😂 I don't know why But wether they like it or not The world isn't unfair.
They are screwed, once they run out of oil America will stop backing them.
a non-muslim in a muslim country having fun? Like: alcohol, sex, drugs and gambling? Yeah, they cut heads for this for 1400 years now. Welcome to arabia, tourists!
im pretty sure u might have the worst YouTube channel  ive ever watched.
Education is going to be the death of Islam.  But literally every petro nation failed, despite that huge wealth. Except Norway.  Weird, weird.
Oil from shale is mostly a byproduct, we do it mostly for the natural gas
Mohammed nin salman.  MBS Bin salman
50/50
1:23 say that again
5:58 you know what else is massive?
Some twenty years back the prediction was that the world was about to run out of oil.  Today, twenty years later, the prediction is that no one needs oil in twenty years. What was predicted twenty years back was wrong, so will the next 20 year prediction be.
Why would I vacation in the middle east when I could go to Europe, America, Japan or Korea?
these gulf countries are ruled by the biggest mafias on earth lol
Literally there's no advantage going there. Imagine getting drunk and doing something wrong.
Saudi Arabia is pretty much a big family where the dad runs shit
99% chance that that stupid line, which is impossible and there are other stupid mega. Projects will never work. Will lose a ton ton of money and when they do run out of auto oil. No matter what they do, they will collapse and they will get what they deserve for having a country built on luck. The luck or bad luck of having everything good come from under the ground rather than working for any of it like the rest of us do.
P L A S T I C S
they dont work yet they think theyre the best the citizens just sit on chairs all day getting free money
Warthunder is russian spyware
And now they found Lithium which is used to make EV batteries.
If they want more tourists they could simply open up Mt Sinai for Christians and Jews to pilgrimage to
Salmonella
Oil will never be done until every last drop is used.  The amount of energy in a cup of oil is a miracle really. One barrel of oil has the energy equivalent of one man shovelling dirt… for nine years.
Actually you got here for poop bullshitt video The whole world will eat because Arabi kimza(oil)
Correction : alcohol beverages is still banned in Saudi no matter what religion. You get caught you go to jail. Although it could be smuggled through foreign embassies but not for sale
((‎اللهم اجعل هذا البلد آمنا وارزق اهله من الثمرات)) بإذن الله ربي معانا ويرزقنا من فضله لا نطلب من اي احد غيره هو والله يوفق حكومتنا وكان الله في عونهم
Saudi is an immoral terrible place and will always be, call me racist, I don't care.
The data set used to compare schooling from Saudi Arabia to Gabon is is skewed by also counting temporary migrant workers who usually work low end jobs and don’t have a background in any education. It’s an honest mistake, but can you please mention it in the description or as a comment?
They should invest in solar panels. It would transform some of the land into arable land. Rather than whatever the hell they’re doing making gigantic lakes in a depression with salt water to make them into habitable land. Just use small cannals with gravel and sand to filter rain water after the land is terraformed
What about the towers
And how exactly is spending trillions on haphazard products going to bring in more trillions?
at some point were you ever going to get to the topic of this video? 5 minutes in and you're still blathering on about the history of oil.
The way you have written what is written on the flag of saudi ,it’s disrespectful,remove it ❤
Pie in the Sky.this will not change for 100 years!
3:35 yooooo who in SA though building Barad Dur was a good idea?
You have zero respect. How could you put our holy God name in such a way and on an animal.   What an awful values
For some reason whenever I watch a vid it automatically dislikes it I feel like it’s a bug
you mean to tell me the dictator like regime that is run entirely off of one resource is about to have a collapse cause they were to full of their own egos to diversify their income? wow....who would have thought!  i think the reason most of the population is so young is probably cause the older people realize "this place is a complete lie!" and move to other countries. i mean lets not forget the giant "luxury" tower that dont even have a working sewer system, this is what happens when nepo babies run a country, the idiot would rather break his entire nation and his family throwing money at every little idea he hears then sitting down and thinking about it for more then 10 minutes, i wouldn't be surprised if his meetings are just.  "sir abdul has this idea...." "GIVE HIM WHATEVER AMOUNT HE NEEDS!" "sir...but he wants to dig a massive pit in the middle of the city for no real reason...." "DID I FUCKING STUTTER?!"
This sounds like a really good idea, except the Arabian Peninsula will be uninhabitable in 20-30 years.  Between high temperatures and no water, there won't be any people who can survive in the future climate of this place.
I don't think the line is going to draw in nearly as many tourists as they think it will.   Also, you forgot to mention that THE WALLS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE MIRRORS. What a great idea that won't create any oroblems at all.  And somebody pointed out that this could disrupt animal migration. It's over 100 km of wall after all.   That water park thing sounds interesting, so maybe that one can pull people in.  Tho I'd personally build an amusement park instead of a stadion. The stadion could still be built somewhere nearby.  Adding an amusement park in my opinion would be a better use of the money than the line   And even if they came up with the most amazing tourist attraction in existence, as a woman i still wouldn't dare to travel there.
Arabian gulf??????????????😐😂
The one real tourist attraction the country has is off-limits to non-muslims....
19:32 *Norway just chilling in the corner being unbothered*
war thunder integration is crazy
What happens when dumb money runs out of money?
Wow looks like there gonna be fucked over
The best way to build a thriving private sector is to minimize the taxes and regulations that the private sector must bear. As to what that private sector is doing, as long as it's not coercive, fraudulent, or negligent, let the private sector actors decide. No subsidy is necessary, because a private sector that needs public support to survive is actually dragging the country down for the benefit of the well-connected.
4:23 for some reason i just imagined the saudi king doing the hakari dance after you said "gamble"😂
Well,  oil at 4$/barrel is estimated to be gone by 2050    but there will always be oil available (like the venezuelan oil that needs to be more refined))
Yep, im going to Saudi Arabia for University and cashing in on this mega development while i can
7:14 brazil mentioned  🇧🇷
NOOOOOO
If the EV market doesnt take off like theyre planning then one day the oil supply will start to fall behind the demand and when that day comes the Saudis will inherit the entire global economy
WHat u rlly get from war thunder that the snail has infectedyou and not to trust any capybaras, and the grind.
War Thunder is also a <<P spy app ! Better to know it's the same like Leage of Legend is!
❤
Lucid is an open market American based company
Electric cars aren't the way.
Haven't we predicted oil peak at least a dozen times since Henry Fords heyday?
BRAZIL KINDA MENTIONED
gotta love the propaganda. insults saudi money and oil at every instance trying to imply it is evil, while oil is nothing, but a natural resource mined from within saudi without the need of colonization. true we have the craziest projects and some of them to put saudi on the map in terms of tourism and investment. But they are not the most important, what you did not talk about is the massive infrastructure being built. whether transportation projects such as roads, airports and railways. or stormwater drainage systems with hundreds of dams and culverts being built. In any industry, the 2030 vision have achieved goals and that includes military. since 2018, saudi have increased localization from 4% to 18% of its defense budget, which is a huge step considering we have one of the biggest defense budgets in the world. even in E-government, vision 2030 has put saudi among the top in digitalized government. most governmental services do not take a couple of days from the comfort of my own home. and in a country mostly made up of deserts, we sure have huge agricultural projects that include fish farms, as we export even shrimp. All that and i did not talk about loans and financial support for small and medium businesses. The fact is that we are progressing and taking the world by surprise, it is why you made this video in the first place. all this info is free and only couple clicks away from unbiased sources. One last thing, when oil prices go down and is no longer in demand as before, the last country to be affected by this is saudi, due to the cheap production of oil we are capable of. the first country to be affected is the US with their rocky oil, and trump is already planning to put billions into oil to jack up production. i guess the peak is not any time soon.
Good to know a monster like MBS and his demon empire has a finite life, and he is too stupid to buy his way out of it.
Bro I live near abiaq im gonna be rich
Oil is dead because it was never alive.
OPEC was its own undoing. Shoulda just kept oil cheap so alternative energy wasn’t so enticing.
alasl herein are your every premise so wholly gloho, or so ignorant,, as to mandate my very reluctant unsub, fren.
Hi, I'm interested in starting to invest, but I'm not sure where to begin. Do you have any recommendations or contacts that could help?
8:19 Not every muslim, but the ones who can actually afford to.
0:44 WOOOOOW by 2035? We'll be fucked by then anyways but hey it's always like that when it comes to environmental regulations. "Oh we pledged to do something by 2020 but only achieved 0.1% of our goal? We'll push it back to 2230"
Yea less than half of the world population will try to reduce oil consumption. Key words "try" and "less". Africa, most of asia mostly the poor countries that grow like crazy and so do there oil consumption.
The funny part is, as someone who’s been to Saudi Arabia, they have many things that could attract tourist, natural beauty, and archaeological sites.  But for all these great sites , They have no park rangers no signage and people just throw trash everywhere anyway.
the prophet has said These hard life arabs would someday build a skyscraper
It is the Holy Kalma Of the muslims that you have written on the Camel roughly kindly Fix it !
17:44 from where did you get that info from and definitely is wrong
Same issue as the UAE (and the rest in general). They're Clergical Elitists forcing their beliefs onto everybody at the threat of death.  No amount of dumb vane overpaid tourism traps are going to sweep away from the fact that they run Islam like a backwater cult.  Who with common sense wants to invest in that?
I'm sorry for you since you are so dumb.  You anti-organic fuel zealots have been predicting peak oil in ten years for 75 and there is far more organic fuel being produced today than ther was  65 years ago when the world utilized 100 times less than it does today.
Spent month out there pretty impressive how fast they are growing
all internet geo political analysts fail to realise that countries as rich as this have hired the brightests minds in the world to advise them on how to reverse all potential threats so all these doom gloom collapse predictions are almost all garbage
Every natural resource is finite
Dubai is a slave country tbh
That's adorable you think that
Some of their ideas seem really dumb (e.g. the the Line). They would do great building up their coasts into beach communities, and building the interior into greenhouses (a-la Weifang) and solar farms. There is also a strangely massive black market for sand that SA could easily capture.
as long as the crown prince funds me ill play war THUNDER
The idea that petroleum in the earth is depleting and we will use it all within even 300 years is comedy. Oil reserves maybe not.
my dad worked in oil for 60 years and he heard peak oil when he was 16
Total bullshit this is agenda video oil is there everywhere what they want is to control the people by using EVs. Better buy petrol or diesel engine vehicles only from sinister plans behind EVs
This is hilarious
I'm asking you with all respect can you remove the text on the camel and keep the sword because it has a holy meaning in Islam
i wonder why we kuwait are never included
20 years ago we were all worried about running out of oil, then they discovered we had 10x more reserves than we thought due to technology being developed and matured costing in that 40$/barrel range which is within the ability for developed economies to pay. Opens a whole different can of worms.
Oil is not done.  Clickbait fraud.
Except oil is NOT done. There is nothing to replace it as a fuell. The technology of batterys is mature enough. Plus there is not enough mining the materials  to make the batterys necessary for electric to replace gas powered cars.
I'm sure peoples will keep the oil runing because they make a lot of money out of it and they can't let this go from their hands XD
ALL HAIL THE ATOM GLORY TO ATOM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
nobody care about electric cars  its super gay
Bottom line, if you don't ease up on your restrictions on drinking alcohol no one will want to vacation in your country.
With their money they could just buy out all the top universities in the world and create campuses in SA. Then they would be a hub for education and then just say its free for citizens boom. 4 universities with 50b investments each. 200b. Im saying they turn into the most prestigious, well endowed and advanced unis in the world. I feel like that would drive a lot of immigration and private companies.
Then why are they still bombing us for our oil and gas and resources.. why are brown children dying with American and western bombs
pretty sure we hit peak oil when the prices drop into the negatives in 2020 all the oil companies are looking at reducing production to inflate prices in order to safe guard their future same is going on at opec
Tell you this, they ain't getting shit of my tourist money or anybody I know tourist money until they reform their human rights record. They should look into that first. Otherwise they're just going up a down escalator.
2:11 In metric, that's about ~6.968 trillion Liters of fuel ! At ~1 billion light-duty vehicles nowadays & an average consumption rate of ~7 L/100 km for the average car of the category, it'd be enough to power each of them for ~98 000 km, or ~270 km per day !!! Of course, there's another billion & a half of those cars expected by 2050, and we're not counting trucks, boats, planes & trains either, on top of all of that...
No matter what they’ll never have more refineries than Pasadena, Texas. Look 10 feet in any direction boom refinery. Is that a building on fire, hell no it’s just a refinery
I will still be alive to see the middle east opec countries stop using their oil to blackmail my economy
Let's not forget that whether by accident or on purpose, it's the biggest pos people that end up promoting places like Dubai. They're a meme, not a good kind.
I'm pissed. Lucid was pitched to me as an American car company, competing with the Tesla model whatever the luxury one is. It's 60% owned by the Saudis??? god dammit
Oil will never be done even cars will be going hard. Trump will pump up oil
No human rights no tourists
Saudi barbaria a nation of dependent npcs
they have tax now, we pay for living and doing business
as a Saudi Arabian, aside from all the hating calling all these projects, stupid or dumb just makes you look stupid only time could tell but until then we shall see which is stupid. You are one of the strongest country world leaders. also that was ridiculously rude please go get a life 🙂
Oil will never die due to mainly the different amount of energy it provide and renewable sources do not provide tharñt amount not even half of it in this day of age Most of the electricity that are provided to charge cars comes from electrical conversions which of course need oil or crudes to run
I personally would think just shift to finance and investment. They have a lot of money, and you know a sustainable way to make money when you already have a lot of money? Yes, make money off of money. It's an especially obvious choice if you don't have much else.
I could switch to my drugs being made of plants and fungi, and already my clothes are made of... well sht idk what it is exactly, it's just something that mulberry leaf-eating moth larvae made. There's alternatives to plastic as well, but vinyl and latex are irreplaceable and I need them both in my life. Good thing it rains oil on Titan.
Bunch of bul[lshit. Oil fields refill. Half of the planet hasn't been explored at all. Antarctica is an oil tank.
EVs are not the answer. The pollution from a lithium is far worse.
The Saudis should invest in bitcoin
Your ideas are ass. And you can take your opinions on alcohol, "gaming," and festivals is Saudi and shove 'em. An Islamic state would only operate well if it abides by Islamic rules. That buttface MBS is just ruling the country and God is punishing it for not going against him.
That was the slickest ad placement. I applaud it
The worst thing is it is person dependent. It is a major problem for development in Middle east countries. Character of the rulers determine everything being developed or going bonkers.
They have been saying since the 70s. That we're gonna stop using oil. It's all b*******, trust me. The billion dollar oil CEOs aren't letting their f****** shareholds go anywhere.
Been hearing this nonsense about oil my whole life, yet oil is still everywhere.
I don't know about millions of people but I refused to leave the Balkans and go to Canada, maybe if I was 15 instead of 45 but when I was 15 I didn't want to move to another part of the city, so probably not.  Canada & USA are just places to visit not for living but if you don't have a choice they aren't the worst places to live but by no means they are among the best
They will be left with those Muslim tourists and that's it. The place is just a bad place for living + fake religion from pdf prophet
"Let's go to Saudi to play the newest video games"   - said no one ever 😅😅😅
Now all major WTA events which is the women tennis are all located in the middle east mostly Qatar.
It will.
just mention nuclear next time for green energy
Energy demands will increased anyway high tech needs power🤔
There’s nothing better than listening to all the idiots regurgitate the same “well run out of oil in XX number of years!!!!” line that has been consistently proving false.   Get real dummies.
If we could just stop burning it, it would be a game changer. Ditto for coal and gas. Using them just ans sources of other products would be acceptable.
nahhh brodie violated that black man in the beginning
I don't understand the OECD ratio calculation and what the percentage change rate is. If you scale it down to how one person gets affected, what would this mean?
Many tourists go to countries with pretty girls. In SA, they only see girls in black hijabs. Where is the attraction in that.
Saudi becoming Venezuela
I wonder whats the street name of t h e l i n e
5:06 why is there clickbait on the tank
US has the most of everything but not necessarily in global production of all resources but definitely enough to help themselves & 30+ nato allies & 10+ southern pacific allies, as u can see not enough to help the whole planet, future production yes, but the US can prioritice microchip for quatum pc, super ai & other super technologies. That's why the love Taiwan.
Good luck with that! A ski resort?  Lol yea fuckin right
Plastic is made with oil??????????
Next 30 years looks ruff for oil
Ehhhh I don’t know if that brand works for Canada anymore lol
They’ll just remove the makeup covering their well-oiled human trafficking industry
The EV stuff is basically a gimmick or scam to collect, and laundry money. It’s not going to be the thing in 2035  when are economy isn’t wealthy enough to do so. It’s gonna be the same thing as last time. “ we gonna run out of oil so switch to EV “ and suddenly we discovered a lot of oil in the see or whatever
They said the same thing in 1978 we currently use orders of magnitude more oil than then. Oil isn't going anywhere especially when people figure out that battery EVs are a poor, and in some cases vastly inferior substitute to the internal combustion engine.
Educating and training lazy arrogant mofos....good luck
Who wants to go to a country stunted by religion?
Also,in regards to tourism, don’t you have to wear a thawb and abaya as a tourist? Does the government provide those? Just another reason I think that would sway people from visiting, maybe some to visit.
WoW im amazed of how terrible this guy research is!
Well first world countries will shift from oil but third world countries will never lose dependency.
Wonder where they expect those millions of tourists to the country to come from when fewer and fewer people have disposable income to travel much of anywhere, and that trend is almost certainly not going to reverse.
6:50 thats so fake.. they dont allow women to study. Wanna make us belive rhey have female researchers? 😂
Saudis are finding the other income than oils  That’s why they are focusing more to entertainment sector
This is all a lie there guy.. USA oil is much higher quality
How interesting! I did not know that its name is the Arabian Gulf!
Saudi Arabia is not a working economy but a rentier economy. They want to continue this trend even when the oil wealth dries up. I don't think that would work.
The only way out for Saudi Arabia is to invest the massive oil money into new renewable energy sectors and eventually convert the kingdom into a massive renewable energy exporter. Saudi has a potential in Solar energy sector considering its a vast desert, and also maybe wind energy.

That vision 2030 is just an ad
As an arab, this is so sad...
Although I have my fundamental problems with Totalitarian Islamic States I have to respect the fact that they’re trying to escape the oil dependency, it’ll be interesting to see what it is like in 10-20 years. Heck if they keep investing in the stock market they might have 35 trillion in stock assets by that time alone. Given that they invest an additional 500 billion a year
Saudis said they are white too. Hhhhhhhhhj
If we want to breath without a mask for air pollution and want to eat. We forced to stop before fossil fuels run out. That's why.
3:12 not only 70%, but 80%. Polymers are produced from oils
כל מדינה צריכה תרופות(ומחקר ופיתוח).במקום לייבא נשק,ליצר נשק.חשמל  ואנרגיה כדאי ליצר בכורים אטומים. אניברסיטאות צריכות למסחר מחקר. וליצור סטארטפים ,ביחד עם הסטודנטים
We do not know the future,( إن شاء الله )my country will succeed in what it is working on
You dirty dirty diry diery dairy diety. How dare you to 5:26 put end of add there. Love ur vids but dayum dat not nice.❤
It looks like everyone is jumping in for a chance to scam Saudi Arabia. They're like that rich friend that people take advantage of but nobody wants to tell them the truth. They're getting absolutely bilked, taken for a ride. It's sad.
4:40 tanki online🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
It's been 7 months since this video and oil hasn't collapsed.
WHAT?!?
شيل صورة الجمل يا حبيبي فيها لعب غي لفظ الجلالة
Everybody trying desperately to forget that patrol WILL run out this century
You still have an abortion problem go fix it
Why don’t Y’all focus on your countries and their problems and stop barking at SAUDI
Lets be clear.  They only benefit from Geography.  They had no hand in building the oil infrastructure. Not one Saudi billionaire is wealthy by intelligence. They are nothing but Camel herders without British engineering and the Western market.
Dude all these videos which claim nations are collapsing are so funny
Fallout series cannon???????
America boutta become bankrupt
Anywhere is better than this fake country don’t waste your money and time.
19:41  People of Saudi Arabia are Muslims, that means they can't reproduce without marriage, ... people  born out of wedlock are bastards and can't have their father's name, they can't inherit or be raised by their fathers, ... this means people MUST get married to make people.  To get married in KSA, a man has to ask a woman to marry him (it doesn't work the other way, women don't ask men), this man needs to be financially stable and have a HUGE sum of money to pay for the women as her "Mahr", it costs approximately $50K on average, and then he MUST pay for her living, she is not asked to participate in ANYTHING, not rent, not grociouries, not even her clothes.  Here is the problem, currently 66% of men in the age of marriage are not married yet, ... this recent event is due to high costs and financial instability and woman focusing on work instead of wanting to build a family.  "People build economies" , ... you need people in numbers and the dip in birth rates and population is coming soon.
Aint no way anyone is making the trek to a burning desert just to see a water park and arcade stadium.
At least Saudi is doing something with the money from their oil. Everytime Britain had inventive ideas, heavy industry and my oil in Scotland the government sold it all to their rich mates, now Britain has got no economic growth all while the present government squeezes its citizens for every last penny 🙄
Futurama prediction?
That War Thunder ad matrixed me, I wasn’t ready. I’ll never smoke while watching your video again, I thought I was tripping.
they basically gave billions of dollar to the 3rd world country and were surprised when they found out what happened
What in the propaganda
Along with downright crazy megaprojects, I think that the main thing holding Saudi Arabia back from better integration in the world is Islam, which has many rules holding tourism back which in turn makes all of these projects obsolete
How about slavery and influencer toilets?
0:00 tell that to diddy
Honestly I don't see how Saudi Arabia can have a large private sector GPD without oil money. The only way that will ever be possible would be migration so as stupid as it sounds focusing on attracting migrants with large mega projects is sorta on the right track.
I've been living in Saudi Arabia since 2003 and i can say, it's one of the greatest and safest countries in the world. The people there are pretty handy and god feared. What the washed western media telling you is all lies. Saudi Arabia is now Evolving and Developing in real time and it's gonna be one of the beat  countries for Tourists.
6:39 my Saudi ahh: YOU PRONOUNCED IN THE WORST HYPOTHETICAL WAY POSSIBLE💀💀💀💀💀💀
Electric car sales in germany lol
6:07  As a native, best is not the term i'd use🥲
No it’s not.
Peak oil is a lie.
Saudi will never run out of oil
Lol peak oil huh?  The 1970s called they went back their bullshit theory!
The rise of the Antichrist? 🤔 Poison the world with their ..................and.................(can't say that), and make them look like it's on the up and up.🥱👍 Jesus saves and has risen 👏 🥳KJV Ephesians 6:12 Welcome to the end of the end times....
While the spendong may be rather erratic. They are the right direction, its gonna takea while and a lot. But where else do you see the leaders of a country pushing this hard for the future in a more proper way?
Its sad they sold out just to use their oil money on nonsense
they also need to legalised coke😂😂
I dare someone to count how many times he said oil.
Nuclear
they need to get a new book first.
Electric vehicals most of the time are stupid to me concidering the vast majority of electricity in alot of countries is produced with coal and oil
Wet dreams of green dommunists. Thumb down.
Where have I heard this before? Oh yeah! I remember, back in the 70's! Then in the 80's, oh!I forgot! Yeah, Back in the 90's and 2000's I have heard all of those things before. Did you know that in the early 1970's there was an oil shortage? Yeah, it was called the OPEC oil embargo and it was scary Gas stations were rationing gas and news media was hyping up the situation just like they do today. Also "Scientists" were saying that there was an ICE AGE coming! No kidding. But, that's not all, if you go back far enough and check out the old newspapers you can find these kinds of stories just about in every year and decade until you reach the beginning of newspapers. Now I'm not saying that it's not going to run out, but nobody knows exactly when because they're always finding more oil deposits and these"renewables are greatly overhyped and over promoted. Electric cars are dangerous and toxic. Wind and solar will not supply enough for all these people who are accustomed to this modern lifestyle. It's gonna have to be nuclear power before it's done. No, we've got a long way to go before we give up oil.
I love how you all wish for our🇸🇦 downfall when we're literally thriving, and your economy is absolutely falling apart.
Wait moms made of oil?
Oil is dead Lightning is fuel The rig is full
I feel feel the death of oil notice is premature think what oil is used for
good to know that taxing the world for years will lead to a nice line of houses for the rich out in a desert somewhere, truly giving back to the community
Am I weird, but I would have no interest traveling to those new places, especially in Saudi Arabia? I travel a lot by the way
I can't believe this insane leap of progress Saudi Arabia has made, now women in the country can also be forced to engage with the most depressing and inefficient transportation method ever and contribute to climate change as much as men! Oh how the times are changing.
2035 2040 2045 2050... ect never is a better estimate
Didnt age well with the fact that everybody reversed their decision
Saudi arabia is becoming a giant roman circus hopping the people won't notice that the country is collapsing 😂😂
Saudi arabia is on top , no matter what the media says , our king and his son the pronce are from a tripe big here in saudi arabia , i am related to him , and yes life is so great , system is obeyed by all if you are saudi or not , you will get paid a lot working here in saudi arabia , im 26 years old and i got paid from a private company working with the goverment around 10k but the goverment give me 1500 a month for something i dont remamber , + they give me half my salary everymonth for no reason too , most of what i say is about all saudi arabia , life is good here the ppl have an amazing lives here ask ur relative if they ever comes here , and please for thr love of god don’t take what the media said about saudi arabia as a fact cuz a lot of countries hates us , with our war in yamen amerca and iran supplise the hauthies with weapons but u see in the media that oh look saudi are bad cuz they defend themself and protect thier citezins how dare they 🤓☝🏻 , god bless us all
Ayoo! Why there's an x in the Saudi Arabia flag this not cool im a Muslim and this disrespectful man it should like that لاَ الهَ الىَّ اللّٰه محمَّدً رسُولُ اللّٰه and not لا الهxmohد bro it's ok if don't know im just saying plz don't do this mistake again 😊
Sounds like they are running out of oil…
BUILDING -  all these  resorts for an estimated 100 million people a year ? ------ GOOD  LUCK  LOL . because  we will not  go there --  americans , chinease , aussies , japanese and espescially europeans .  reason why ? EASY ---- just look at the  world s " WORST FOOTBALL  WORLD CUP EVER " --- REASON ????  no alcohol and no freedom  ---- SIMPLE !
Dont forget Aramco produces something of value Apple produces pure shit just like facebook, Instagram and all other worthless crap money built on nothing. also the line build plan still looks like money more well spent than Bidens BBB policy.
Ford losing 44500 dollars on every EV care made and all other EV producers doing basicly the same and reverting on their no diesel no gasoline car policy.... its another E85 joke!
>Peak oil The 90s called, they want their fear mongering headlines back.
half a trilion for "the line"? nah .. unrealistically low
So halal mode
Doubt
People thinking Oil is dead because of EVs, Nah the infrastructure cost is too much the cost is not feasible. In installation of a single EV Charger on a public place it will cost 20X the charger cost, not to mention the burden in the Grid infrastructur itself.  Sad to say But Oil is her to stay.
Electric cars are cutting down the need for dirty oil. So Saudi cannot exist as a petrol state forever. Like it or not less demand for their dirty oil will happen in the future.
Uae*
"Peak oil" used to mean the world would run out of supply.  Now it means the demand for oil has now approximately peaked.  Some use cases will persist for a long time, but overall demand will progressively fall.  If demand doesn't fall, the climate is screwed.  CO2 is already 50% higher than pre-industrial, and rising fast.
One of the reasons Saudi oil is cheaper is because they have less environmental regulations than the west.
As long as mecca exist, saudi wont go bankrupt.  Oil depletion will only cause a hindrance to their lavishness.
If Saudi Arabia became a liberal democrscy it would probably save them
I can't believe you used the wrong name for the guy, he's called Bonesaw Salman for a reason.
Saudi Arabia is also drifting away from oil now with vision 2030 and football development entertainment  and Saudi Arabia will be the newest exporter of URANIUM! Saudi Arabia will be fine
Alberta Canada northern oil patch is dead slow.but theres still lots of $here.but u got 2 hussle.use 2 b 5 bosses 4 every worker now shes all hands on deck
so much yap
Oil would be already obsolete if it were not cheaper than the alternatives we now have.
Their `gamble` is to try lure foreign business startups there to avoid a lurking disaster but who the hell wants to start any business there??
MBS his solution is simple. Game and Anime. And Riyad will be world capital of gaming.
4:02 : UUPP!!
I love this guy's videos
is crude oil manmade ?
The main problem is in saudi is that  they are not well educated and yet they think they are better than everyone else
China is *not* a superpower. Lol
I’m from Saudi Arabia and I’m learning about something that could destroy our economy, but we will still have a good economy after we build everything we have planned, with vision 2030.
You need to be a millionaire to have a vacation there just like Dubai hotel  average cost over 300 usd a night just visit vegas is much cheaper waste the money.
No US will always use a lot of oil they are own my oil company the US government doesn't know what renewable energy is.
saudi arabia is the balenciaga of countries
You literally couldn't drag me to Dubai or the UAE, they are just everything wrong with human arrogance today. Slavery, useless flashy mega projects.... its just a facade for their lackluster country. They gotten lucky with the oil... its not deserved money and they will lose it.
15:18 Philippines mentioned 🗣️🔥🔥🔥🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭
Saudi Arabia leadership needs to read and implement, “The Art of War.”
The line in literally the dumbest concept ever
still use slave labor.
So out of date - they’re not even building the line… it’s now a building - not a line. 🤔
😂😂😂😂 sure.
none Muslim diplomates used to have unlimited alcohol now its 2 max... rest they buy from gov. bar lol
unfollow for wrongly writing the kalma of Islam on the camel
Create Manufacturing Jobs...that they give to Foreigners? Laziness is gonna be their downfall.
I thought Venezuela held the largest oil reserves in the world🤔
Day 1 asking for a Bitcoin video❤
lmao, we renewable energy scam videos again  😴💤💤
In order to become a major tourist destination you need 3 things. Gambling, alcohol, and hookers. Saudi Arabia bans all 3. Good luck!
These commenters are all sore losers
They should have taxes but only from buying products not from income tax
I pray for global developement of Solar Energy  Water Energy  Wind Energy  Electric Vehicles.  That's called peace for middle east.
Not true❤
Trump is doubling down on oil,
The mexicans are represented by axolotl 😂 the animal symbols really hooked me
yay! More fear mongering fake news! What you're saying about oil was said during the oil embargo. "Oil in the Persian gulf is expected to run out by the late 80's"
the line failed
You are done with your creepy brain.
It's funny to see Americans and Europeans with fu*ked up economies that can barely find food to eat, with no hope for owning a house, and they choose not purse education for financial reasons still have the ability to lecture other people. Yes we have mega projects while the British government cannot even build a train to Manchester and you say what again? The global south will take over the global economy, cry more please.
2030 WEF/soros/schwab say thanks for obeying peasants, now go get your next boosters
As of today there is 0 tech that is anywhere close to even helping get rid of oil. There is still idiots calling o & g calling it “fossil fuels” when 1 of Saturn’s ings has more o & g than the entirety of earth. As for the ev, solar panel, wind mill pushing Greta’s, go to China and Russia and bitch
😂😂😂😂😂😂
U guys love mbs because he is not muslim as u
Mbs is very bad and is making saudi arabia more bad
There is more oil in world then you can use Africa has more oil than any of the northern countries that's why the so called arabs are buying up Africa
Currently, I’m a Saudi student on summer vacation, spending it in Indonesia and some other countries. I’m unemployed, just a university student, enjoying peace of mind and happiness. We don’t have to worry about taxes, health insurance, or how to pay university fees. We get education and health services for free, and on top of that, the government supports us both morally and financially. Now, I can contact the Saudi embassy wherever I am in any country and ask them for anything, even if it is trivial, and they will do it. However, the fact that my child will grow up without being taught by a teacher who is homosexual makes me not worry about the future.
yay morocco mentioned 🇲🇦
I can't wait to not go 🥰
7:29 if i had a nickel for every important building in saudi arabia whose name literally mean the cube in arabic id have two nicles which isnt a lot but its weird that it happened twice
That transition was smooooooth best sponsor ad ever
You can have a functioning economy with a strong middle class, or you can have big shiny buildings. If only they could vote.
isnt gambling haram?
The problem with a shift from oil to tourism is the sheer heat in Saudi, 47 degrees celcius as a man of Northern European heritage is not my idea of fun.
They will not became tourism country because alot of culture of it agains Al-Qur'an since they are islamic countries not like UAE. Which is good in they way and they not even need oil since 1,9 billion muslim always need to go there at least once on theirs life if they can. It's already make alot of profit it's like 100Billion USD each years from pilgrimages visitors  There is no Alcohol and no Public Intimacy and low crime in Saudi just because islamic law it self which is good in my opinion and they also have strong culture.  "They" (some people) just need to less greedy.
Peak oil is a myth. Oil is second only to water as an abundant substance.
Don't forget their slave labor.
You know this dude know sht, when he said Saudi Arabia has 0% Tax Simple Google search, 5% Tax started in 2017 and raised to 15% in 2020 till this day 15% on almost everything  Misinforming people with such a basic info, what a legend xD
Saudi Arabia has been fudging their oil reserves and they’re going back to tents and camels in the future. Looks good on them too. MBS should be taken out of power any way possible.
Spending in agriculture seems the only good idea they have but the land ownership again raises the red flag
Remember though  a third of Saudi Arabia’s oil is used domestically for desalination plants and electricity for air conditioning mostly. It will be about 50 percent by 2030. They are getting high on their own supply and will be riding camels again by the end of the century.
cia channel
The Saudis will fuck it up, the house of Saud is utterly incompetent.
Women going to the despotic BS that the religion misogynic as hell.  Hates LGBT!Q, women, other religions, and that is just the easy part.  Who in their right mind would go to that sand concentration camp?
Ive heard countless stories of how single women in public were cursed at for not having male guardians. Why tf would i wanna go there and be treated like a second class citizen as a solo black woman
8:34 😂
4:40 A TANKI ONLINE REFRENCE
100 million annual tourists per year?!  Thats 8.3 million per month.  Thats 275,000 tourists per day, spending time and money.  If the average tourist stay is 4 days, that means 80,000 plus tourists are arriving (and leaving) each day on planes, trains and automobiles.  I don't think so.   Well maybe.  If they quadruple airport capacity.  If the average plane has 200 passengers, we're talking 400 planes per day.  Thats 16 planes per hour just for incoming international tourists. They need more airport capacity and hotels for starters.  Also, the travel costs have to be 10% what they are now for a chance at those numbers.
SA is too restrictive (amongst other things) to be the next Dubai. All their crazy investment schemes will make a few people rich, but probably will never add value to their economy, just like China's zombie apartment buildings.
The Line was an absolutely moronic idea that is turning into a disaster. A lot of projects like that going on over there. Getting ludicrous amounts of money to ego projects seems to be easy.
It's always a perpetual "60 years of oil left" ever since the 1980's.
The thing done are those governments and peoples pushinb this bullshit. We will soon see large numbers freezing in winter and going hungry cuase they decided to use wind and solar and pixie dust for their critical energy needs.
Cloud  seeding is responsible for climate change and fossil  fuel
Saudi can become a top player in the inland aquaculture sector and renewable energy with their vast lands.  But they decided to invest in tourism, which is not viable since they will share tourists with Dubai, Qatar, and other Arab countries.
hoser you have to make us an algerian video please
The line has to be one of the stupidest thing in architecture history
They also played "Quota" on Hajj Pilgrims from other nations.   Probably to inflate the price via Hajj Tour agencies.   They can get at least 1m+ more tourist should they let everyone with money in, while also expanding their Hajj infrastructures.   Oh, that "Once in a lifetime if you can" for Hajj is the bare minimum, many have go for Hajj every year, the only limiting factor for these rich Muslims is the "Quota".  And like everything in life, the Extra Rich can bypass the Quota by throwing in more money.   That 1m+ Hajj tourist/Pilgrims are not without a data, In Indonesia alone the Queue for Hajj is actually 47 Years(max), with 11 years minimum if you are lucky and get bumped up(assuming anyone from earlier queue died). And these people must pay their trips in advance to even be in the Queue.
They squandered their earnings. They should have been investing in themselves 40 years ago. They've only just started all of this development.  If you were born earlier, you could have advised this nation.
Pov America:GIMME DA OIL Edit:I’m Saudi Arabian I didn’t know we were that rich lol
If I want to visit touristic places, I would visit Greece, China or Italy. What makes them think that I would go to Saudi Arabia to see tall buildings and endure the heat on there? That's a gamble that will not work at all.
Oil Camel 🐫
Well, after seeing all those plans, I can confidently say Saudi Arabia is doomed
I swear everytime someone makes a video about a middle eastern country the vomment section turns into a full on war
Say whatever you want, but in the end we will reach what we want  🇸🇦❤
😂😂😂 Imagine believing China and African countries are going green
Get your facts straight Saudi Arabia has VAT. You tube is full of these shit wanna be reporters spreading misinformation
They just ended the us-dollar deal. Will this hurt or help Saudi?
They are planning to produce semiconductor and EV,  that is the creepiest things ever heard
those projects are insane... i like it
Bro I have seen many of your thumbnails which show an animal with the flag of a Muslim country but some flags especially Saudi Arabia's flag has the "kalimae Taiyyiba" and putting it on an animal as a skin is disrespectful and many other include the word "ALLAH" which shouldn't be put on  as an animal skin.
30 years ago it was 50 years left till we run out of oil. Now it's 60 years till we run out of oil.  <sarcasm>Accuracy of your claims makes me believe you!</sarcasm>  Saudi are branching out not because they think that oil will be gone. It's a thing called diversification of income (done actually right, unlike you know, done by EU and US).
Wwe's crown jewel is a major success in Saudi Arabia. Now WWE is hosting 2 or 3 shows is Saudi per year
Every other year, we hear peak oil. And the couple of months later, peak demand goes even higher.   Gtfo with your weak ass psyop gaslighting bs.
Maybe they should invest more in human rights and getting out of the medieval ages in terms of their political discourse, as long as thay doesn't change, no sane family will actively weight more a big building than the safety and culture familiarity from the current political climate
LOL all CGI projects I bet you it won't happen
Anyone not from the Christian Race is from the Tree of good and evil.  Yahweh (YHVH) the creator God, who's name was removed 7,500 times from the Bible. ... Praise Yahweh, our creator, our savior, and through the flesh as Christ our kinsman redeemer.
These big projects and endeavors all seem so random and independent of one another and don’t seem to me like they fit into an actual plan? Saudi would have been much better off if they became experts in some sort of mid tech manufacturing. The countries location, cheap energy, and top notch infrastructure would make them pretty hard to compete against and Saudi could subsidize these industries for a while to drown out any competitors. All these gulf countries want to have a service sector economy without first  ever having an industrial one. For small population countries like Qatar and UAE they can probably get away with that but KSA won’t be able to.
Using oil for chemicals is very different from oil for energy.
they need to invest in street racing
Saudia Arabia’s spending is like that of ten year old me with an unlimited budget
Saudi Arabia be the landlords of the countries
The line has completely failed already. Saudi Arabia has done Yemen bad.
China is not going green lol
..... ....COMMENTATOR....  DREAMER........ ....OIL ..IS NOT ONLY....CARS..  NO FURTHER DISCUSSION....  BYE..BYE
Government planning the economy is and will always be equal to failure. See Russia communism. Free market will and individual entrepreneurship is what can give a chance.  Cultivating local talents.
Are we not gonna talk about the suplus of males among the children (18:02 )? These can't be construction workers. What is happening to the Saudi baby girls?
Branding Canada as a "Safe, wealthy, and open country" is the biggest tourist trap I've ever heard
The Line has to be the dumbest fucking thing I've seen seriously considered as a major project.
9:20 Ooh, that’s a good one.  Also, WAS MY COMMENT JUST DELETED?
The point to this is that the petrodollar would inevitably lead to alternate fuel economies as having a state in charge of being the kingmaker in a neoliberal world order would fail if slowly
Not a fan of Saudi Arabia’s treatment of some groups of people but one thing I will say is I think Mohammad Bin Salman is the most competent world leader by far from what I’ve seen. Either he has incredibly good advisors or dude is just smart.
Trying to get people to switch from oil to electric is failing in the US it seems. Barely 5% of news car bought are electric. And barely any charging stations are built. People see it as political motivated only and thus don't trust it
RARE LATVIA BIRD MENTION????
Well, sounds like China is going to get a lot more infrastructure projects
Oil will be here in a century
مغلق
Norway's wealth fund is more than twice that size. Why don't they just fill the entire desert with solar parks? If there's one thing, other than oil, they have more than enough of its sunshine. And then they can stay an energy exporter.
ha! that Canada bit about branding is ingenius.
Overall this is an excellent review with constructive criticism.  KSA and the Gulf States have emerged from Medieval times into the near modern times in two generations.  They have made many proper investments decisions but obviously they have made many spectacular foolish grandiose fiascos as well! They are probably misled by their advisors but ultimately they are responsible for their own decisions.  Prudence and caution are essential.  Climate crisis Global warming and rising oceans as well as global crop failures are here. Famine and mass starvation are reality.  Religious fanaticism wars conflicts and unscientific life views need to be overcome sooner rather than later, all over the world.  Education and dealing with reality are the main ways.  Best wishes for all.
what a sh!thole nation is this i cant even 0_0  So much stupidity in one place is beyond everything.  They gonna fall. Not knowing how to invest is the country driver.  Those "princeses" they can just spend - not bild. Most of their projects are failures. They are draming and feeding their egos.
BLACK GOLD
OPEC forecasts peak oil demand by 2050 due to automation, aging populations, and global EV mandates.
Even tthe Saudis are ggoing carbon-free, while Aamerican big oil bans 200mpg gasoline veicles and zero point energy.
Being realistic, I dont want it to collasp, another middle east country with a bigger populace and military going awol is not someone sane wants
I wonder if they'll start respecting basic human rights
I have question and i hope someone answer me please: why countries like US has a relationship with countries as saudi arabia,is it because oil and security? Or because saudi gives them beautiful gifts and they are close friends and in love? I mean countries as Iran has a big population and they deserve a good living conditions!  Tomorrow if saudi arabia just threatened countries as US is US will still has a strong ties with them because a good relationship history?
Hopefully  we can switch away from oil in the coming 20 years, so we lose dependency from all these countries that use the resource to blackmail us. That they decided to restrict oil production after russias brutal invasion says everything about their culture.
I think people forget it requires oil to produce electric cars, and oil is essential in almost every major manufacturing industry. Even the electric car will still need oil to lubricate its parts. Unless we invent a solution to oil it will never disappear
France is currently the most-visited country in the world, with ~72 million tourists. No way will 100 million people a year go to visit a stinking hole in the desert just to see a needle-like building, a line of a city, and some ski resorts and water parks.
0:46 World's ONE superpower and a third-world wannabee whose only real asset is having a ton of people. Per capita, China is a joke, and if they didn't have such a vast pool of cheap labor to exploit, no one would think of them as being important.
Saudi Arabia is surrounded by dangerous countries. Their location is far way from where people want to be. Folks from Africa can join, but if in Europe, they would find another country. Asian people Rae probably the main ones they should look to attract. In the west, their are too many countries to go that far. Canada, Brazil, US, Mexico. If the west wants a vacation, they can go to Mexico, the carribean, Patagonia, Denver, California, Baja, Miami, Bahamas or Barbados, or if they want a desert like location that isn't the west, they would chose to go to Chile or Peru.
Few facts about Oil: world does not have the luxuary to dump Combustion Engine cars and move to electric cars. airplanes and ships do not run on batteries. on top of that exectric cars are a luxuary option and not a practcial one.
If anyone believes that China's demand for oil or coal is going down anytime soon or that their "climate targets" serve any purpose but to deflect international pressure, you are hopelessly naive. Go look up an AQI map to see what a decade or more of Chinese environmental promises has achieved. Still, other countries might lower their demand a bit and drive down the prices.  The sad end to the Gulf story is that their elites will flee with their money when the gravy train reaches the last station and the rest will be left to persist in gradual decline among the ruins of their previous wealth. I don't know where their wealth level will settle in the end, but I don't see these plans helping.
mbs should convert to christianity, its the only way to go, to get out from the 7th century stagnated f aith of his ancestors, its the only way for his country to be migrated upon by all people of the world.
One of the other things that Saudi Arabia has no lack of is sunlight. I could certainly see solar being an attractive alternative energy source over there. At least on the local scale. Perhaps MBS could surprise us and build a fusion power plant.
use places like mecca to commercialize + modernize cities for foreign citizens to live in affordably and contribute to the economy > some invisible glass line thingy
I’ll give it you, the War Thunder add transition was smooth
It’s so unbelievably stupid when people say it’s turned into fertiliser. It might power the means of making fertiliser but you don’t somehow magically make oil turn into something that makes plants grow. That’s absurd.
Turists spending thousands of dollars... Like these princes do. Why do people come there, 0% buiz tax, money laundering, oil money. Noone would build a data centre in the desert. Or have a ski contest. The line is totally dumb shit. Where shall all the money the tourist spend come from? Norwegian oil wells?! They will need one or two generations to teach the average saudi what work is.
As an Aussie I’ve gotta be honest and say Saudi Arabia isn’t really at the top of my vacation list. I work in the outback so I get to see plenty of desert sunsets and wild camels the main difference is that I can do all these things in my country WHILE HAVING A BEER…
7:10 you need zero Muslim laws. People don’t want to relax but have to be on their toes and go to jail for wearing shorts 😂
The saudi has a social contract to the entire muslim ummah because of the holy sites. They will be expected to subsidize and organize the haaj in addition to providing jobs to its citizens. Not to mention pay the bills of countries like pakistan and egypt.
Except religious purposes, why would anyone want to go to see Saudi Arabia?
tourism is most unreliable part of their vision. even a one fking vlogger can destroy their infrastructure.
the only thing i think about when i see these mega projects is: how much will maintenance cost? i don't think they are investing their money in a wise way
I genuinly hope that Saudi Arabia does not find a way to make itself relevant in the future. Their leaders are some of the most awful people on Earth, ruling with a terrible ideology. Hopefully they will be as relevant as any other desert nation on Earth. The world needs to forget the evils of KSA.
Fallout energy crisis coming soon.
They're gonna find gold now
Crown prince MBS  must think twice before investing his money in Pakistan bcos it is army ruled dictators COUNTRY some other countries like Pakistan are Egypt , Myanmar , Iran Afghanistan etc etc but Pakistan is ATOMIC POWER and you can't recover your FUNDS from Pakistan by using force.  If CROWN PRINCE MBS has surplus FUNDS it should invest in Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan, Sri Lanka, Maldives, Thailand , Korea, Malaysia, Indonesia, Vietnam, Philippines or South Africa but Why ... bcos they are comparatively smaller, liberal democracy, non ATOMIC hence their SOVEREIGN GUARANTEE will be HONOURED even by future governments and if not HONOURED then guarantee can be invoked by military force but can't be applied against atomic Pakistan and  Afghanistan which is grave yard of super power.  PRINCE can invest in India bcos it is liberal democracy, multi linguistic, multi ethnic, multi religious, multi cast , multi cultural  and not a puppet toy  like Pakistan and Afghanistan who had been a battle ground of super powers USA, USSR, RUSSIA, CHINA.  PAKISTAN WILL DEFAULT IT'S REPAYMENT OBLIGATIONS TO FOREIGN LIABILITIES TOWARDS ITS LENDERS AND INVESTORS. CHINA AND USA HAVE ALREADY BURNT THEIR FINGERS AND NOW ITS THE TURN OF SAUDI ARABIA. M BS SHOULD CONSULT THE THREE ADVISORY BEFORE INVESTMENT IN THE PAKISTAN.  BECAUSE I HAD BEEN A BANKER AND I CAN TELL THAT A BAD BORROWERS LOOKS VERY LOVELY AND FRIENDLY BEFORE LENDING BORROWING RELATIONSHIPS AND REAL PÉRSON EMERGES AFTERWARDS.  INVESTMENT BASED ON EMOTIONAL STINCT ALWAYS GO BAD . REST IS BEST YOU TO DECIDE.
it's not the world, it's the evil elites of the WEF and Bildiburg
an new energy as never replaced an old one,,,  we still use wood fo eathing and coll for energie,,,  in denmark 80% of cars are now electric but the gasoline comsuption as only drop about  10%
Bro should invest in industry
Oil is finite but lithium too so yeah
china is a regional power. not a super power. for that they lack power projection.
“Canada is a safe, wealthy, welcoming country” 😂😂😂😂 come on man! Canada in reality is a country with a broken outdated immigration policy that  generates zero productivity and zero diversity! (When 80% of your annual new ‘permanent residents’ and ‘students’ are from just 1 out of 200 countries on the globe today , them something is terribly wrong with Canada and with the one country Canada continues to curry favour with - you are effectively just accepting desperate economic refugees from that one country) . And take a look at the gold heist and car theft gangs recently apprehended: 80% are from…..guess? 😂
Line has been reduced marginally lower from planned 180kms to 2.8kms 😎
Oil’s demise has been predicted in every decade starting with the 1960s and yet here we are: EVs are increasingly looking like a passing fancy (due to costs of maintaining and building infrastructure), aircraft are nowhere near being solar-powered, or ‘electric’ and the US still keeps a very close eye on countries with hydrocarbon reserves……..
Youtubers and green economists in 2924: "Trust me, we'll be done with oil in like 10-15 years tops" As long as there are wars, assholes with private jets and people who import the products of child labor from overseas, we'll never be done with oil. Do you seriously think that people like Jeff Bezos, Taylor Swift and Travis Scott are gonna cut down on their consumption any time soon?  As for China, they're having the time of their lives with the cheap oil they're getting from Russia and Iran. Same goes for India
LMAO... the Saudi Crown is going to be in for a rude of wakening...
To telling the truth: Saudi Arabia 🇸🇦 supports CCP until ended up HUGH in debts so greedy royal.
Do you have any idea how many times I have heard the prediction of “peak oil” in the past fifty years only for the “experts” to be proven wrong yet one more time?
Aspirin made of oil?!
Wow oil is so done it only makes few trillion € per year in transactions, how will the companies ever survive??
Electrical vehicles are going nowhere. Too expensive and necessitates huge investment in infrastructure.
4:40 tanki online
You forgot to mention that Greg Norman and Phil Mickelson live there now. I’m sure those two alone will save the economy. Just do your research a little more diligently next time. Otherwise spot on love your work.
Making up the horseshit as you go along🤣
a lot of fake bullshit that are funny too lol
Man just said about war in Ukraine and then promotes a game that supports ruzzia
Saudi could have just kept the mega projects simple. Try to create reforestation, add renewables and simple properties if they think numbers will rise.
The world only has 60 years' oil reserves left.   Now when did I hear that before? Oh, yes, it was in the early 1980's. Reality is that new oil reserves are being found all the time, and we most likely won't run out of oil for a very long time.
Sounds like a more competent Venezuela.  As for investments in state run companies, theres plenty of study cases and the record is mixed to say the least.
We will not be using less oil in the future. We will be using more.
The growth rate of the Saudi economy is 4.4%, and you narrate everything with unparalleled absurdity. Didn’t you feel that there was something wrong with your words?? Are you an economics specialist or just an amateur?  Saudi Arabia is planning to diversify its sources of income because simply oil alone will not make you one of the countries easily. There are oil countries and countries that export natural gas and do not care about developing themselves, and there are countries that care about developing themselves.  That’s it.
Yes buy Justine's brand! Buy buy buy! lol fire trumpdeau now.
0:14 "Obviously, we will never be done with oil", the literal thumbnail : OIL IS DEAD, yeah unliking, unsharing and unsubscribing
Dubai 2.0
Then WHY SO YOU SAY OIL WILL END??? YOU DONT KNOW WHAT YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT!!! 200 YEARS FROM NOW, WE WILL BE USING OIL!!!!!!
Guy sounds Canadian

What good is a country if they don't sell ALCOHOL 24/7?
SERIOUSLY i still think the little guy representing mexico, is just the cutest shit i have seen in a very long time 😫i love that little shit
In a future that predicts water scarcity around the globe the current undisputed leader in energy and desalination plant use could be a leader in desalination plants and energy.  Imagine, a world where efficient desalination plants and small modular reactors (SMR) are brought together effectively solving part of the cost effective equation for states and cities.   Now, how to dispose of the brine? 🤔   Could further refining yield molten salt battery grade material?   I wish I knew the answers but I’m not a scientist.  PS- I believe I read somewhere that the reason the United States stopped pursuing SMR’s was funding. As a close strategic ally with a need for diversified business, water resources and the ability to fund it seems like a natural fit for Saudi Arabia and the United States.  PSS- Research agreements are a part of diplomacy and friendship.
it be gone soon
The sad fact is Money would have no value in future. But natural resources Oil, Gold, Diamonds value will keep increasing
Firstly, I want to thank @hoser for having the best and most accurate video, most of the videos out there are far stretched from reality and making Saudi look like empty deserts and camels only. we have places ever greater and more advanced than Dubai. As a Saudi citizen I can say most of the information here is correct and it is amazing to experience this change, this vision is on every Saudi's mind. Another thing to add is we have Uranium reserves now! which means nuclear power instead of oil. we have an approach to sustainable energy sources and one of them is nuclear. Exciting times really!
Watching KSA implode into an orgy of desert warlordism is going to be very, very funny to watch.
Venezuela has more!!!!! How the fuck are they messed up
Cant wait for electric bills to skyrocket
They've kind of brought this on themselves through their efforts to jack up oil prices over the last 50 or so years. The higher the cost, the more incentive there is to create cost-effective alternatives, and the more R&D money goes into those efforts. Who knows, maybe they'll be indirectly responsible for the climate not going to absolute crap in the coming decades.
Can’t wait too see there new projects , 2030 is around the corner , 2050 is also close, would like to know how quickly people adopt without electricity , let’s leave it to our future children :P
The line will now only be 1.5 miles long...
Just they are 50 years late to wake up.
12:20 Isn't buying into electric vehicles sort of accelerating your crisis...
Well the line is dead and so does the 1 km tower 😂
if they want tourism they need to change their way of life , their far too repressive they need to be more like dubai
My my petrol pricing is nutsss
When you have money who needs education
Maybe if they used some of the money they waste on these largely useless and wasteful mega projects to artificially lower the average price of a plane ticket to the country, maybe they'd get more tourists. Most people can't afford $1400 per seat round trip to go and see a desert!
I get that they did it to desperately save their broken economy, but OPEC cutting oil production in 2022 was one of the biggest middle fingers to the entire world in modern history. With how much of the economy, especially agriculture and transportation, is dependent on oil products, those extreme price hikes have led to inflation everywhere, with households with a low income being hit the hardest. Reporting record profits at the same time is an absolute dick move.
Keep Coping. Oil Is A Limitless Resource...😂
2 More Weeks...
The irony is that saudia is safer than canada 😂
"How do we increase tourism" "Give women human rights so people aren't afraid to come to visit" "No"
I wouldn't want to play golf in Saudi Arabia it's one giant sand trap
Alaska has the biggest oil deposit reserve in the World.  America is trying to use someone else's while preserving it's reserves.
Tbh I don’t think electric cars is gonna last that long…I think we’re gonna go back to hybrid cars,for the sake of convenience
Whats worse than a wealthy dictatorship, is a wealthy dictatorship thats too out of touch with reality to make good financial decisions with their country. Lets hope Saudi Arabia doesnt end up being nothing more than a cautionary tale
That warthunder ads😂😂
Hello sir i want to comment about how u showed saudi as a camel thats not my point, my point u printed the flag on the camel and showed the shahada as randomize characters, just if u can't show it as it appears then don't.
The green camel snorting lines of oil had me.
Ngl, as a female I would never visit

The U.S. has a lot of oil not sure why we needs to buy others for
Doesnt titan have oceans of oil, maybe im thinking of some other moon
The thing about China's green initiative... it's a complete lie... they actually burn more coal now than they ever have. 13.1 million metric tons per day.  We need to stop believing the lies the CCP tells us, they are so fucking secretive, and they lie habitually. They are basically North Korea with money, and i feel like not enough people understand that. Modern China has always functioned by the philosophy of "do now, deal with repercussions later". Propagandists like to say China is very "forward thinking" but once you start learning how the CCP works, you realize they kinda can't function like that when the entire government survives on nepotism and corruption.  Seriously one of the most dysfunctional countries in the world.
The PIF is going to be the next black rock
Now comes the most important thing as soon as a population pays taxes, they also want a say in politics because I pay, so I also want to have a say in what you do with my money
If only IQ could be taught… If only IQ was a question of socioeconomic status…
their women aren't hot. that's the primary issue.
Self destruction
Amazing video dude fucking amazing I smart man. But I don’t think this all electric will happen as soon as planned no way. We can’t harvest electricity efficient enough. Windmills fucked, solar expensive expensive + more I think it’ll be oil for abit longer then the world will change powers and Nicole teslas electricity harvesting techniques willl come to life once corruption fucks off for good.
7:15 - I love it that you picked a Capybara to represent Brazil. Also: if you don't come to Brazil, Brazil comes to you!
Future urban explorers will have a field day exploring these vanity projects
You absolutely have no idea how much more oil there is on this planet, as if Mother Earth keeps making it. The pick oil concept taken out of context means and serves nothing other than just being an argumentative tool to push some  delusional agendas or plain and simple some greedy manipulative schemes by some big oil cartels. I actually suspect that they are the ones pushing for the windmills, the solar panels, the EV's, all the non sense, because they are actually profiting from it. At the cost of collapsing the Western World economies to ashes. As for the line, or the 15 minutes cities, wake up people, these are prisons!!
Lets make sure that the megaprojects wont fail because they will waste money
I don’t think the state can do much except for investing in universities and instilling industrious and entrepreneurial virtues in school. I mean I wish them well but these methods go nowhere in my opinion. They should rather safe this money for the right time to investment in education. They could also give aways working visa and citizenship for Muslim academics from all over the world. They could give away property for free and collect few taxes and after a few adjustments in education many multis would come. These kinds of things make sense.
Jesus Christ saves!
It shows how much your are educated in the matter and the research you’re putting in the video   I’m not talking about Stock footage of badly/silly represented saudi’s   May come as a shock to you, but there’s city called (Abha)You may want to search about it to see if there is snow or not 😨.. 13:09   Also the contract with the players, it has a clause to invest in the country or something in the country, whether it be buying a club, having a business doing advertising and so on   Also, some contracts are false, like Stephen Gerrard being paid 34 million, when he himself denies that and said he was getting about 2.4 million   So let’s talk about Las Vegas it’s literally the same, the new dome your freaking about which is a failing advertising business let alone the maintenance or lack of it  You also mentioned that we are dependent on oil and we are not interested in investing in new types of energy  Then, why are we making new electric cars and having installed new windmill projects?   We have plans for renewable energies, but you refuse to indulge that , just for you and your tone deaf audience to make up your opinions about our country with false info   And we are using the oil money for these projects, and getting more tourists in the near future , yes, some of them may not pan out but we will focus on improving them until they do , and nothing will pan out just in the first installation without enhancing it or improving it
I would NEVER move to Canada, or any western country. Even for free.
PERSIAN GULF NOT ARABIAN persia had power before saudi arabia was a thing
Seems like saudi arabia bought hoser too for advertising :D
The world will use less oil when Russia and Chine DECIDE that the world will use less.  And right now, they have NO PLANS to end oil.
Yeah just like we thought the year 2000 there will be flying cars around
As a muslim i feel so much pain because Saudis are trying so hard to get that money and materialistic things,power,influence etc while israel terrorist are killing his brothers in Palestine and they dont even want to try to do something.......
not visiting without affordable alcohol
Is this a meme channel? The Idea that oil is going anywhere anytime soon is hilariously stupid. Gratz on your click bate clicks though I guess.
Time for KSA to get into the NPP game so they can keep desalinating water on the cheap.
كلنا سلمان
The IEA went ESG some years ago with its data. Only OPEC keeps useful data on oil. Unreliables will not be growing much.
electric cars? wee
These countries want to LOOK like they won’t be using oil but that’ll always be using it. When we run out it’ll all be synthetic. If that wasn’t the case then the moves to get off of oil wouldn’t depend on using more oil further up the chain away from complaining eyes. Nobody will complain about burning fossil fuels when it only happens where they can’t see it and don’t interact with it
Well done. Nice video however there are some miss leading informations. Appreciate the work needs more research and asking suadis for some informal specially about the social activities.
Doesn’t look like it’s dead  It’s just Europe thinks it can survive without it while it turns into conflict zone sponsored by usa Everyone pretty much depends on oil but here in Saudi it’s better to have different incomes just in case
I am pretty pessimistic about it. All saudi had to not partner up with US and wage war in muslim world and actually built the muslim world instead of causing destruction and eventually in other countries. And actually built any industries in their own country.
Saudis don't have the skills or the literacy rates to compete with the citizens of OECD countries. They only have their oil sands. This fever dream of "Oasis in the desert" already happened and it's called Dubai which was bailed out by Abu Dhabi when the financial crash occurred.  Saudis have nothing to offer the world except religion and oil, both things the world is actively trying to move away from.
The ultimate resource trap
Ngl i wish that these new plans dont fail
After i saw the video you are dead wrong its not gambling its a good think from mbs 👌
Our government isnt putting any actual money into real renewable energy. Its a money laundering scam
The oil running out is a myth.
As the world seems to be sliding toward fascism, an anachronistic monarchy of fundamentalist racists has a very bright future.
Fun fact: so far %50 of the economic sources in Saudi Arabia has nothing to do with oil. More likely the participation of oil in the Saudi economy will not be more than 20% by 2030 if not less.
U really had no idea about our future 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
"When a problem is solved by money, it's not a problem, it's expenses"
Seamless ad transition. A+
The EU and other nations that are betting petroleum as an energy will hurt every other oil producer in the world with the exception of Saudi Arabia and some other Middle Eastern countries. Reason being is that Saudi Arabia produces the highest quality and also the cheapest oil in the world due to the geography in the terrainextracting oil from Saudi Arabia gives it absolute market advantage over everyone.
Pssst, we also are now Taxed 15% on EVERYTHING. Also, have very high gas prices (ironically). Neom? A childish dream to give fake hope to those who are simple minded.  Edit: they're FORCING companies to hire women. This is a super issue because I've seen many women with 0 experience replaces old hard working experienced guys just to say we have female bosses! (and oh do they suck... Like holy). Offering jobs? Well, yes, in statistics. The gov would make a check up on companies to see if they hire enough Saudi people but guess what? These companies only hire Saudi people for around 3 months (training period that can end the contract without any reason or consequences). How do I know? I worked with HR and had to help do that...
Idoit
Doesn’t that tower have no sewage system?
As a Saudi I’m truly truly impressed by your knowledge of Saudi, Great work man
as a Saudi this was so funny to watch for me since the 1980s people been saying the same things you are saying for over 40 years right now this is nothing new to me but good for you keep dreaming we are building we have a king that does what he says not a president how talk till gets elected then does nothing thank you for the video tho
“Oil is going to fade into irrelevance”   Meanwhile electric vehicles still suck
Y también son la capital del Imperio del Mal. Detrás de cada atentado terrorista, detrás de la ideología que esclaviza a las mujeres, persigue a los homosexuales, promueve las dictaduras, corrompe la Democracia, y erosiona los Derechos Humanos está siempre la mano silenciosa de Arabia Saudí como líder supremo de los golfos del Golfo. Su bandera es la del Wahabismo, y su sueño someter a su tiranía a todo el planeta bajo un califato del terror.
"oil is done" HAHAHAHAHAHA nice start, tell me more
Who doesn't want to join 700,000 + players in gambling addictions! Great video other than the gambling promotion.
Global heating will shortly deny access to these resources and dissolve the Saudi 'state'. Commodities specialists might want to note this fact.
6:40 hey i live near those tree things!
its "sa-'ood" not "sowd"  just a quick correction i dont wanna hate im saudi myself
Wii sport resort is becoming real!
Saudi Arabia should've changed its name to Arabia (to distance itself from the Saudi questionable brand name) and it should import Arab workers instead of south Asians thus revising the kafala pseudo slavery system, and lastly it should move away from the tribal social structure towards a more secular, civic structure, meaning now anyone can become Arabi (citizen of Arabia) this alone would've swayed the Arabic public opinion in their favor (unlike now, they're hated by most Arabs over their blunder in Yemen and non support to Palestine), the only sacrifice is a little bit of freedom of speech, thus entailing vocal wide spread support to Palestine thus more strained relations with Israel/US. The monarch can stay absolute (because that's the only successful model Arabs produced this far) but over time his position should become hands off (ceremonial) and that's the only way to guarantee longevity for the monarchy. (It would also be cool if they marry into the Hashemite dynasty (Jordan's dynasty) since that family is far more legitimate in the eyes of Arab populations than the Saud British tool and shameful History of collaboration.
Kinda disappointed ur vid had lots of wrong facts and wished u focused on how we going more green, farming etc that’s one thing I’m happy about but yah I’m scared of the future as a Saudi i genuinely hope positive changes will happen not only in economy but socially as more ppl (mainly young generations) are becoming more open minded and less extreme
I AM STILL ALIVE YOU DUCK!
I feel sorry for the Saudi people. Having to live in a US-backed monarchy is like living with an abusive partner at home.  Saudi Arabia deserves a future without the Al-Sauds.
E
The writing on the saudi arabian flag is sacred. To deform it for the youtube thumbnail is extremely insensitive. I’d recommend removing the text and keeping the sword.
is KSA a buy?
i heard that for yours all  i seen is the west is falling totally ...

They need to change the culture
They gonna invest themselves into poverty
A gaggle of sheiks 😂
Now, if they'd stop killing trans people, we'd really be in the future.
Another issue I think is just as big as oil that is being overlooked is Saudi's reliance on foreigners to essential run their cities and businesses for them. At some point they won't be able to just buy talent and 'domestic servants' to do everything for them. The citizens at the end of the day is what makes or breaks a nation. When a nation is at its lowest after war, or economic collapse, the citizens determine if their nation will bounce back, or it permanently collapses.
bro usa wants oil latvia watnts potatoes
There are a lot of haters in the comments section. God bless my country and the government for their hard work trying to change things. 👏🏻 As someone who lives in Saudi, every year looks different with the massive improvements. It's a really exciting time! 🔥 And to the haters and those wishing for our failure... they can just cry about it. 😉
OIL IS DEAD INNOVATION IS FUEL ARABIA IS FULL
You haven’t talked about business, tech, industry sectors and hydrogen energy. All are very different since the vision was launched. That’s why your take just covers the surface/the bling.
to rely on tourists is silly idea. to educate your people and foreign workers into high productivity jobs would at least make sense.  even though IT/consulting business can be volatile, too. but at least it has something to stand on. at least electrical engineer is needed somewhere on the planet, saudi arabian government bureocrat is not.
Hoser is a W
To think that Renewable energy can replace oil... that's a dumb idea.  It will never happen.
You can;t have a world class university if you don't allow beer. You can't have a world class financial hub without cocaine and other illegal drugs. You won't have women willing to run around in the broiling desert in Islamic garb. No booze you lose. Well they now allow women to drive cars. That's progress.... after over 100 years of men being able to drive cars. That culture won't attract many tourists or workers from Europe or America.
Most of it interesting, BUT Oil is no way dead. Won't be for decades.
There was one guy who criticized NEOM. His name was Khashoggi.
Seems that they need to invest in solar and wind turbines. Then, they would be able to sell that power to Europe
i was about to write a paragraph on why you were wrong on most parts, however i saw till the end i agree when you said economy is made out of people and not massive buildings and tourists, however saudi has the fastest gdp growth out of the g20 countries for 2022 and 2023, and saudi is still growing as fast as ever, the attention saudi is getting in these past years is promising, saudi now has the role for 2030 expo and 2034 world cup, saudi is also aiming for electrical dependance not just because of them not wanting to run out of oil, rather itll be more benefical for the next generations. its alot more reliable to rely on innovation and science rather than one material.  in a way saudi is investing in everything which isnt a bad thing its just if the ambitious  projects will actually be finished or not, i live in saudi and i already see them doing work for the cube and so on, theyve already bought land from the citizens and are starting on building.  in general, saudi has a bright future but the only thing im worried about is riyadh, alot of people are focused on the economical city of riyadh which is where alot of jobs and stores ect are, this is a problem because it causes alot of traffic, if they just adjust the roads and traffic then saudi will easily be one of the best luxury countries for tourism.
Listen, people, and understand that Saudi Arabia, or the Middle East in general, is not all barren desert, and we live in a barren desert with a camel. We live like you, or perhaps better. I hope that you visit us or watch clips about Jeddah or Riyadh, the capital of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Do not become stupid and write a comment without researching or listening to words. Someone, educate yourself before you speak and see, and now we live in a very advanced civilization, and the government listens to all people, gives their demands, and supports all the young talents who need to move forward, and I always thank God for the blessing that I am Saudi.

"Saudi genome project" doesn't sound good
China’s gonna end up like Logan’s Run with the age crystals and Sandmen…
At least they have a vision that isn’t just growing their Military Industrial Complex or Pharmaceutical companies
Saudi going for a videogame paradise route kinda make sense since the actual Saudi Prince has whaled multiple times on Dota 2's battlepass

there is mixed false information unfortunately
alcohol is not legal
nah most of electricity is running on oil
People should stop taking oil from saudi arabia. And choose venusala.
3:22 there's income tax* (retirement fund more than income tax) of about 12% + there's sales tax of 15%
Keep crying
الله يحفظ السعودية 🇸🇦 ❤ و الخليج
Basically they wanna be norway?
peak oil production becomes peak oil demand only 60 years later imagine believing that cars will be electric by 2035
Please remove the flag of saudi arabia in thumbnail
Fuck.. i love Oil
Saudi Arabia has huge mining industry so be worried about your collapsing economy in the west, Saudis are ding really fine.
If "oil is done" so is united states. As long as united states exists oil is not done.
We had electric cars in 1910 that went 100 miles and up to 25 mph in America. How did that work out?  PS. Oil and gas are organic and contain no fossils, They come from bacteria, plankton and algae (renewable) which are natural, organic substances.. You are being lied to by the so called "Green" game. Its all the industrial wastes, toxins and poisons from mega-corporations as "cost cutting" games and control over everything that is behind a large part of the issues. Its all about making $$$$$$$$ to the point of insanity. The whole anti-Carbon nonsense is also just that. Nonsense. Carbon  0 = extinction.   China is just an example of what happens when you make people dependent in a beehive mentality and then use force to try and control what isn't yours to control. Control populations, you destroy yourselves. Control production to stay in power, you destroy yourselves. Take more than you give back, you destroy yourselves. Take more than you actually need, you destroy yourselves. Its all playing out real time.   The whole  "Climate Change Doomsday" cult is more BS as a money grab. America alone could feed the entire planet if the entire world population was 15 billion, every day if it wasn't all being controlled by a select few. Those controlling such production, trade and distribution is where the problem actually is. We are also not having a "real" energy crisis. The solar and wind bit was pushed in the 50s and 60s and 70s and proved to be more destructive  to environments and inefficient. There hasn't been any actual improvements.   There have been progress for far more stable and cleaner nuclear power that lowers costs significantly. The lack of improvements isn't because of tech. Its cutting corners to spend as little as possible and take more $$$$$$$$$. We also have literally been "dumping fuel" sources down toilets for as long as toilets have existed.   I have lived through several decades to see these scams from various paid off "special interests" and  paid off so called "activists" spew the latest narrative of BS (within 5 -10 years we're all going to die because of.....now send in the kids to guilt people to give money).   Since 1985 the planet should have been overrun with spiders, killer bees, and one have of the planet on fire and the other half frozen and everything in between flooded with a few cyborge overlords,. alien lizards and zombie like mutants squirting puss everywhere.    Wake up....even all the so called Woke are themselves lite more than the activated "brain washed sleeper cells." Its all one massive, complicated, yet clear and consistent deception designed to confuse, divide, terrify, turn against, conquer and control, and to exterminate anyone who sees through it all just so the few so called World Leaders can get their rocks off.
Reality: the Saudi regime uses all of this investment and spending as a PR stunt for whitewashing all the  crimes against humanity, environment and terrorist activity.  Theocracy/ Islamic fascism is the worst, where the Church is the state and the Clergy are the statesmen.
Saudi arabia is a sh*t hole that has absolutely NO power to attract tourists. Thailand is much better tourist destination there`s no strange religion & alcohol & women is freely available.
meanwhile they export islamic terrorising ideologies to the world..
All the Saudi shills in the comment section
Saudi Arabia is long term doomed, simply due to a culture of showing off you are rich by not working.  Of course doom is relative.  If robots are doing everything for you, the doom is not because of shortages, but because more advanced societies will be able to push you around, and your women abandoning you as they try to date up.  Stuff like that.
Don't forget that driving in saudi you need a diesel Toyota 😂
Mohamed bin salman going through a war to improve his economy and joe biden is eating ice cream on his couch watching breaking bad 😂
TBH, most of the commenters envy Saudis for their oil money and think that Saudis don't deserve it. IMO, every country should use its resources for the good of its people and the future generations and that's what Saudi does. My only take is that they should help other arab countries because we share a lot of the culture, and we complement each other.
As a saudi, i can  confirm the kingdom is not collapsing, no im not paid, wallahi.
Natural gas is the new oil
I wish our government cared about us the way the Saudi government cared about it's citizens
No not buying what your saying..EV thing is dying as we speak
Important information: Saudi Arabia’s income for this year 2023-2024 is 50% non-oil :)
I’m a Saudi and what you’ve presented is a shallow view of our society, economy, and vision. There’s some truth in the video but a lot of typical misconceptions as well. For example, I have a master’s degree in computer science from a us university, and had to spend almost a year looking for a job so jobs are not so accessible as you said. Hope people can come one day and see with their eyes the transformation and change we’re making rather than hearing about it in a deluded video.
it will
19:35  اتمنى لو يفهمون
Welp back to War Thunder I go
Isn’t this the same channel that keeps saying how Arab countries are gonna be gone yet the worst financial crisis is happening in the us?
the amount of wrong informations in this video is unbelievable....
in the words of tobias from the amazing world of gumball  "any problem can be fixed if you have the money"
the comments are vial lmfao  yall islamphobes fr praying on our down fall 💀
There is so much noise about how the world would end if Global Warming is not controlled. England was supposed to have become submerged since 2001 due to melting ice caps. Well, we're in 2024, and England is still on dry land.  Same noise about how fossil fuel will run out in 1990, 2000, 2010, 2020, 2030 etc. It must be great to be in the prediction business.   Fossil fuel supply, and its use are not going anywhere. Even if automobile become electric, the batteries still need energy. Even if energy is from renewables, the wind turbines, solar equipment still need a lot of energy to manufacture them. Why is Joe Biden's green energy initiative failing massively?
Please dont use the map with the Arabian gulf in it its not its true name
Let's wait and watch for next 30-40 years . I think 🤔 only then we will be able to see whether Saudi will be in future or in past.
There isnt a former coal mining boom town in the developed world that hasnt shrunk and collapsed since the death of coal. Even in places like Poland which still burn coal a lot, the coal towns have all shrunk and become rust belt like cities. I am from an American rust belt old coal town. There are so many early 1900s mansions in the city, despite there being almost no wealth or job opportunities. And coal towns in America are all in great climates, with lush and fertile land and terrain. In other words, they are very habitable places, if jobs existed to keep people financially viable.   Saudi, Qatar, Bahrain and these desert nations with oil will suffer a far worse collapse than the American or European rust belt. There is no reason at all to live in a scorching desert that has no jobs or growth. There is no history there, no great old mansions, no beautiful plants of trees. Just deserts, shopping malls and shiny ugly new buildings. They are screwed, big time.
We want tiger as a symbol of india not an elephant because tiger is our national animal and most indian will love that 😊🇮🇳🐯🐅
11:51😂😂😂
Imagine what will happen to Venezuela once oil hits $20. Can you say migration crisis
This kind of propaganda wouldn't help them my friend, believe me, they are doomed, noway to save them except getting rid of MBS.
MBS = Mega Bulls41t
this video only talks about past and partially current situation things are changing.. if there is a country going to collapse going to be America if Biden or his administration keep ruling the country
الجمل الجميل هوووووووووووووووووه :)
I didnt bother to watch the video when I saw what kind of people are in the comment, fortune tellers apparently
Saudi hate is real we still up tho, time will tell
Oil is not dead bro wtf 100 million barrels are consumed each day
Oil is not dead
أوبيك المتحد و ليس أوبيك العصابة
النفط لن ينتهي على ما أعتقد و لكن ربما الكيان الصهيوني هو الذي سنتهي في الأعوام العشرة القادمة.
Have fun with your homosexual giga project in your F country while the saudis have created more than 1M job and 100M tourist already
they're dumping trillions of dollars into a line city. They already lost the gamble.
these kinda videos are the way to clickbait views lmao and we got war thunder🤣🤣
W saudi
"Oil is done. While oil continues to grow..." [click] Clearly, this entire clickbait story of stock footage is just an excuse to peddle War Thunder.
I thank God for my homeland, Saudi Arabia 🇸🇦❤, yall stay mad
Oil will never go away👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍EV is trash 🚮🚮🚮🚮🚮🚮🚮🚮🚮🚮🚮🚮🚮🚮🚮🚮🚮🚮🚮🚮
0:42 USA told Japan to keep burning oil, or regicide.
🥱
ياصالح وش دخلك بالسعوديه انت
guys common we all know Saudi Arabias economy is single handheld carried by tourism right
I used to date a saudi woman. She was cool but her family was freaky as hell. We had to break up because she wanted to move back to work for the government.
You guys are ridiculous 😂 , all I see is doubting and hateful comments, you forgot that money makes your dreams come true and for Saudi Arabia, oh they got shit ton of money to burn , and I think you forgot Dubai look at the UAE they put so much money in Dubai back in the day and look at it now it's the Jewel of the middle east , trust in the future Saudi Arabia is going to be the next Jewel of the Middle East.
This is part of why the Saudi Arabian government wants normalization with Israel. (Oct 7 was an attempt to stop that, but it will happen eventually)
4:40 h0ser is a tanki online player?
hoser more like bozo er
Why aren't they investing into chemical plants? I mean they have the oil, why not try to take over the refining as well?
everything is true in this video but the alcohol part is just a rumor..
Brother do you homework before sharing information there is a lot of wrong info and a lot of old ones
Saudi King dude is gonna watch this video and copy it word for word
Saudi Arabia all the way 🇸🇦
The 2035 Electric car thing in the EU was delayed. Otherwise good video.
Dramatic clickbaity title...  Saudi Arabia has many challenges in diversifying the economy but is on the right track. The future looks good. Meanwhile Americans have millions of homeless people and Saudi Arabia has 0.
What with the anti Qatar propaganda?? Speaking so negatively about Qatar and in a neutral way about Saudi!!!
13:05 😁
btw electric cars use basically as much oil as normal cars because the electricity is made with oil😂
No matter how much they build stuff and modernize the country, at the end of the day it's still an authoritarian theocracy.
day 13 of asking hoser to do a Thailand video
The Saudi flag has the Islamic testimony of faith written on it. Its not appropriate to put the flag text on a camel or any other animal.
Many say “oil is dead” for decades, well yes in the far future u can’t just rely on one source of income, and investing in other sources is always a gamble.  Oil is still a must and 3rd world countries can’t just switch to electric vehicles or cars with biofuels that easy they simply can’t afford it. I can go on and on but in reality it’s not going anywhere anytime soon.
As ridiculous as the megaprojects like the "Line" are I think the Saudis know that. they probably have no actual intentions of building it, and are just throwing out these ideas out to the world to get people talking.
US would be wise to burn other nations fossil fuels before using US resources. Hydrocarbons once extracted from a well do not refill the well.
Fossil Fuels are one and done gifts of the sun and earth's ability to cook the dead life forms at the bottom of certain ocean regions. Convert fossil fuels energy to oil equivalent energy. Find we're going through 100 billion barrels of oil equivalent energy annually. Wells do not produce oil. Wells are storage containers built over tens of millions of years. We extract fossil fuels. US is extracting oil faster than ever. No nation has more holes drilled in it than USA. Pull up US well data and discover to no one's surprise wells are depleting at an increasing rate. Consider that we must discover 100 billion barrels every year to replace what we used. Although there's many many tales of Fairies in our mythology you will not find a Fossil Fuels Fairy refilling the holes
I don't think there will be any more than 30% of EV saturation in the car market for the coming couple of decades
This guy just came out of a cave. Here's why:  1- Saudi Arabia is building the biggest solar system in the world, and the current biggest solar system in the world only produces 5% of Saudi Arabia's' system. On top of that, the system have already reached over 60% progress wise. It should be fully operational by 2028. 2- Saudi Arabia keeps reducing oil production every year on purpose to make sure the price and demand will increase. In 2023 they reduced it by 800 million barrels. 3- Saudi Arabia's capital was 750 billion just 6 years ago, and now it's 1.4 trillion dollars. 4- Saudi Arabia used to rely on oil too much since 75% of the country's capital comes from it. Now it only account for 25% of it's capital. 5- Saudi Arabia have 2 windfarms that I know of currently. 1st is producing 400MW and the 2nd is will produce 700MW and it should be operational by 2026. 6- Saudi Arabia had a plan setup to reach 100 million tourist visitors by 2030, and they were capable of achieving it in 2023. 7- Saudi Arabia have it's own Electric car company called Ceer. it should be operational by 2030. 8- Saudi Arabia job's right now are equally dominated by both sex. Your old graph means nothing. 9- Saudi Arabia's The line city is already under construction. 10- Saudi Arabia take good care of their people financially. That's why they have too many government programs which give free financial aid to the Saudis.  I can keep going but I'm tired.
Most of the power plant in the world are running on hydrocarbon fuel.... this way or that way you are using coal, oil and gas to power your homes/cars
7:20 اعتقد بيفشل
Bruh no country actually wants environmental friendly solutions for oil...they just don't want to be oil depending so when they fuck up the middle-east there will be no consequences..
We reached a 100 million tourists last week, yay
Dirty place
The fund is intelligent, the other things not
"We could hit PEAK OIL by year......" Sorry man, but the moment you start the video off with a meme that climate activists have been repeating for half a century, the video is already over and there's no credibility to it.
this whole video is based on the premise of "doesn't take an expert to see less oil will be used down the line". Well... that could be in 500 years for all we know. I don't think people are aware of how many products, manufacturing processes, etc. rely on oil.
Saudi Arabia has been warning the international community for 40 years about the need to provide alternative energy sources because it is an unsustainable source and is expected to stop in the next few decades
These electronic cars make tiers from oil and even balls, ink pen, rubber, plastic, helmets, and much oil enters into their manufacture😊        And also many factories around the world depend on oil for their operation.😅

I am saudi who has some american roots and can say that the main reason that people don’t think of saudi as the country they’re dying to visit too is because of religion im not trying to pull out the religion card but ive had multiple people say to my face “i don’t wanna go to the muslims country” even though most of the time saudi is 10x better than the states. I almost got kidnapped 2 times at a young age in the us while im able to go outside without having to worry about getting kidnapped nor getting shot by some thugs its a very peaceful place thats standards are ruined by problematic people and propaganda
Why would anyone want to visit a country where you're jailed for pre-marital sex?
Every year the media alwasy talking crap about oil in KSA is gonna be dried up. And your thumbnail repeat it again. Here we are :
The thing holding back saudi is the lack of soft power and the bad reputation they have on the international community.   Why go there when I can go to Turkey? Not only is it much connected to the world but also the laws are better for people who actually want to "stay" in that country.
"2 more weeks"
oil consumers will never know how it is to run a real nigga economy
With increasing energy demand, the demand for oil will never go away. Unless we perfect fusion reactor. We we still far from.
everything burns under global warming.
as a saudi ill be honest im afraid for whats next all these projects are amazing but still scary if you think about it
It seems MBS will be happily ready to say, F*** Islam if it boosts it's GDP by 1%. This a**h**e has no motivation he is just trying his hand on every hole to see which one will give him a Warm Apple Pie. What more do you expect from a filthy rich, no reason how; kind-of-a-guy. Waste of time..
I was born in Saudi
كلامك كثير فيه اغلاط
It’s time to return power to the old Emirate of Hedjaz, you Hanbali-Wahabi tribe from the desert.  Before the 20th century, people's view of the Nejd tribes was not much better than that of the Qarmatians.
Canada be like : why me 😂
Trst me bro
Saudi arabia is Great island look is tall and big Africa North to East Africa is 12400 thousand and Arab island is so long look Africa and Arab island SIZE. defence 😂.
It's like the gazillionth version of the same video, You've got this trashy thumbnail that screams clickbait, a bunch of images & logos and a dude ranting about how Saudi Arabia is falling apart like they've not been spewing this garbage for the past 60 years 😂
Nice video, but you missed a point; added value tax is another source of income for the government
this video has propaganda vibes i feel
bruh you think renewable energy is efficient and reable or something? what you don't understand is oil is efficient and cheap compared to renewable energy, and renewable energy biggest problem that they are not reliable at all, study a little or ask someone within the industry, solar panels are best of renewable energy and they are far from serving countries demand
FLY HIGH MATPAT
FLY HIGH MATPAT
HA HA HA
The challenge will be to get the Saudis to abandon the security of Government jobs and work in productive Industries and pursuits
"Without Saudia Arabia were nothing" -trump 😂😂😂😂
gaijin just wont leave me alone
Oil is never be dead. So many things are made by oil. Electric cars 🚗 isn’t the future and it’s work well in cold environments, charging infrastructure is a long way off.
Don’t put the flag of saudi burned, there is a holy words of muslims written on it
GDP relates heavily on manpower of the country( = education, highly educated imagrants) if you take out the natural resources from the country, I personally don't think they will prevail. BTW handing out goverment jobs just cause you are a citizen is the worst way to run a goverment. It's just socialism with steroids(OIL money) and won't last long as history sugests.
How much money do u have? YES
This whole video feels like a cope lol
Damn
Yup they keep supporting lgbtk and trans and lik this Dumb ass things but When We invest in our city, they say it's ridiculous. Man I cant Understanding these people.
I dont think the sports thing will work thats a waste of money
Saudi Arabia Basically have the perfect economy for Space Programs
everyone mad and full of hate about saudi but all i can say we made it baby and none can do s,hit about it get more mad
With fertility rates dropping all over the world and with emergence of EV, the new Oil is people. Not just any but educated and skilled ones.  Saudis are lazy, entitled, culture less brats. Can't blame them. The Oil economy made them so.   The only country which has educated people on massive scale is India. Pakistan, Nigeria, etc are producing a lot of babies but no education, no science, no tech.
There's no such thing as renewable energy.  It's all products of the oil industry and heavily dependent on oil.  It's nonsense
If you dont feel a deep disgust and anger hearing all this, there is a big problem And you better not complain when your own country will be engulfed by the ocean, burned down to cinder, or purely and simply invaded by billions of climate refugees Just saying
none of that is gonna work as long as religion runs the country
All of this bull to tell us play some mobile game. Man, hell with it 😅
We don't care about your opinion and view, we will succeed and you will be angry more of our success😅😅😅😅😅😅
An electric car created by an oil reserve, or, at the same time, supported by an oil reserve??? 😭 No way😂
The King of Saudi Arabia is King Salman, father of Abdulaziz Al Saud, not Mohammed bin Salman.😁
Prophecies, economy diversity
We can definitely make are economy less dependent on foreign countries for oil by making electric hydrogen fuel cell  hybrid cars hydrogen cars would have np working during the winter what's so ever they know this
Also Saudi Arabia population to big and heavy realies on other countries for water and there supplies to keep things going if they keep pissing of the biggest buyer's they will only need oil for rockets and by then we will use are own oil because the damand will only be needed for science
When you make deals and back out on them you make advanced countries use technology they wouldn't of used  if you keep to your end of the deal was there own greed that's had country's use technology they wouldn't we don't need oil for much longer with are electric technology and hydrogen fuel cells research we can replace there energy and they know it's they only raise the price this time of year to make up the demand because they know the demand for oil slips this time of year and they make up the  revenue by raising the price of oil we can save money just by cutting crude oil completely out electric during the summer and hydrogen fuel cells during the winter we will no longer need fuel for cars and easily can replace home heating with hydrogen fuel cells and we can make plenty of it's more then they have oil so again they might wanna give the west and it's allies there price on oil we want cause there only founding there own demise by not doing so and that's honestly better for earth not for them by any means there country largely depends only oil sales people dont wanna vist them that's much facts 😂
No we have alot of projects in work like  1 neom 2 the line 3 the one mile skyscraper  4 clean power plans And more  We know that that future is coming  and we are getting ready for it
اعوذ بالله من الحسد ، السبايك ذولا يحسبونا نركب على النياق للحين و بيذبحنا الفقر 😂
No, the problem is al saud keeping most of the money to themselves and giving money only to relatives and other families that married from them, then any others get worked as slaves, and they go build mansion in western nations.
The paraphrase from Mark Twain- Report of my death are premature.  Oil is not going away, as it is far more useful than just producing fuel- how about plastics?
Uhhh so basically Saudi is trying to become Vegas but cooler minus gambling The vision is kinda expensive tho
This is all lies and not based on any evidence
They will do anything to facilitate their own people and humiliate the foreign workers. Take Makaab for example, they are building it inside the city where most of the slave labor resides and calling it an innovation. They can never achieve their goals with the current laws of slavery, dictatorship and corruption.
بعيد عن القمع والظلم والطغيان والطفر اللي صاير الواحد يتمنى ك مسلم لبلاد مكة والحجاز الاستقرار والاعتماد على النفس غذائيا واقتصاديا لأن مر من الرؤية ثلثينها والنتائج مضحكة , كنت منذهل ب 2016 لما شفت انطلاقها وكنت اقول واخيرا رح نشوف دولة عربية متقدمة لكن مع الاسف سرعان ماتبين ان هذا الشخص ماجاء الا بأجندة ليهدم كل عماد المجتمع واولهن الدين والاخلاق وهو ابعد مايكون عن تحسين الاقتصاد , لكِ الله يا أرض اجدادي
We’ll always need /want oil for plastic . They just won’t have the same pull as when they controlled a large part of the worlds ( basically) only fuel source . They want to feel important is literally their crisis ( people who make themselves royalty an name the damn place after themselves naturally need to feel important)
Considering how wealthy Saudi Arabia and Dubai is, it’s almost surreal to think of a Dubai with its skyscrapers dusty and abandoned
Theres a hope that one day Saudi Arabia will become a technology based country.  That is a correct direction that they've chosen
seems like a wild big boar to me..
Maybe Europe and USA will stop the oil Middle East Africa, South America. They will stop the oil after 100 years. They will not listen to liberals they are conservative people Oil is blessing  It’s affecting the atmosphere 0.320.5% that means he doesn’t change the weather warmer  What he does change the weather warmer is manufactures. They work on diesel, and those sea cargo ships. Ships in diesel it’s equivalent with hundred thousand cars carbon So they need to figure out how to turn those factories on natural gas, or hydrogen or solar  As for the cars and the trucks do not change global warming nothing at all it doesn’t affect at all 0.2%, 0.5 maximum
It seems like a good idea on paper. You should follow-up with a discussion of the particular conservative brand of Islam that the Saudi royal family promoted throughout their country (and worldwide). The Wahhabis spent the last hundred years "terraforming" Arabian society to suit their particular worldview, and aren't going to like a bunch of kuffar foreigners coming into their nice, clean Muslim paradise, whether they bring money or not. That may be a problem that MBS can't simply throw money at.
As a Saudi, the video is bisacally a click bait and contain many false information
Do Canada next
Bullshit
Wait video about Liberia
If you really think that you can change your country to green energy or not depending on oil you are wrong, you may ask yourself why? The answer is cheap energy and that is only possible by oil or coal  and you can’t get enough energy from solar panels or other renewable sources and they are expensive + if think that electric cars are Green please look at lithium mines that destroy more than fix the environment
Fun fact : KSA has reached the 100 million tourist goal that was put in the 2030 vision before even 2025
What’s funny is the fact that y’all think that our economy only depends on our oil those days are gone
Less educated lol, we can see that you did your research
Commercialize camel urine.
Foreign workers in Saudi Arabia have historically been at the short end of the stick when it comes to policy decisions. If you ever find yourself in the vicinity of the holy lands, please consider offering money to them.
Saudi Arabia is a good country. The people of Saudi Arabia are awesome 👌
as much as they invest into tourism, all i ever see on tiktok about tourists in saudia arabia say it isn't that great of a place to visit and 1 visit is just enough
are you sure there is no income tax?
Can you make on Myanmar
It is Persian gulf not Arabian gulf
Venezuela doesn’t access its oil because the oil mafia kept them down because it would have put their interest and investment at risk. No competition is good business
Can you Make a Video about Germany 🇩🇪
As a Saudi citizen, I can attest that the country is changing rapidly, and the majority of people here embrace these changes and are very optimistic about them 😉
If i  was owner of that much of oil ill set  price  40% higher
NATURAL GAS SMART ASS
A lot of the info is outdated, for example, we already reached 100M visitors (: + u didn't mention $2.5 trillion in UNTAPPED mineral resources and so on… I think you can do better
Lol, it is funny how you think that you have got it all figured out. These billions and trillions are nothing to them. It seems to me that you have never been to saudi arabia, spending one day there would make you rethink alot of things you have mentioned in this video. Great video nonetheless. The money they have, man, none of us have the slightest idea of how much they have. Just because they didnt disclose their financial details with the forbes, doesn't mean they are not the richest of all.
Go and talk about the decimated American economy. The American dollar has become printed without any basis and is heading to fall into the hell. Talk about your country, which is currently disintegrating between the Democrats and the Republicans. The conflict of the money has become divided between the Republicans and the Democrats, and this is due to the rise of new capital from the giant technical companies that have now sided with the Democrats and not As before, the capital was only with the republicans from the arms companies and the pharmaceutical companies, and the old capital was only behind the republicans, but now your country is in a difficult situation as well. When you talk about 2050 and 2040, do not forget that North America and Europe may be in an ice age at that time, so they are turning to clean energy for these reasons now.
MBS is so rich even if you took 90% of his wealth he would still be crazy rich.
Unfortunately I don't think Saudi Arabia will survive without oil. They don't have many other resources and it isn't exactly a great tourist destination and most of those investment ideas seem silly and poorly thought out. But  mostly it's due to the culture. They are spoiled children who never worked for anything and therefore haven't gained any of the knowledge or experience most of the world has. Despite this, they still feel entitled and superior to the rest of the world. Not to mention the corruption that comes with oligarchies.
BABY DRILL BABY DRILL
These investments and overbuilding are probably going to end up with economic disaster
do you like actually believe this or did you get paid by them?
This is an interesting video about post-scarcity Saudi Arabia but sadly this is an analysis in a  vacuum as the geopolitiical players have other objectives.  It is unlikely that the contending great powers will keep their current shape as energy, population and resource pressures drive them to more desperate acts of military conquests and market grabs.    Any sign of instability in Saudi Arabia will be met by direct military invasion by the United States, setting off a dangerous moment in human history.  My honest fear is that MBS, for all of his plans and bombast, will poliitically find himself at the mercy of hostile internal and exteranl enemies.
So long as it remains fundamentalist in its religion, I wont go.
as you can see 90% of these projects arent finished so ofc oil remains as a needed funder
On another note, Saudi Arabia is so insanely wealthy, and as stated 40 % of their wealth is oil and that number is only bound to shrink as having this money right now is helping them invest in everything that will be invest-worthy in the process not to mention the fact that realistically they aren't as scared of spending money as America Russia or any other major rich nation bc no one is there to rival them they can spend so much in a whole shopping spree of investment buying everything that can make money biggest example green energy and ai companies which you can always find saudi arabia as a top investor in most of them saudi arabia is a country that experienced shame greatness shame and now greatness once more and they know how to never go back to these dark times
Please note, all the investment is borrowed from Zionist Banks, not oil money
My pride just got a hit 😮, 🇬🇦 = 🇸🇦 < 🇨🇦 !!!
Thnx for the bonus dude 😝
Thing that people don't understand is that you don't make energy whit money, but you make energy using energy, it’s call the barrel to barrels return. The same goes one with every energy,  it's just law of physics. This is the ratio combine with the quantity is who make economical growth worth wild.
I'm from Saudi Arabia and this video is to say the least Deceptive.
4:40yooooooo tanki online
Oil will never die
Man india realy got the bad end of the lottery. Nothing there. Everything is in neighbours sides.
TOURISTS ECONOMYS :ARE  LIKE SUMMERS JOB 4 KIDS AFTER SCHOOL. SHOULD TRY SOME KNOWLEDGE ECONOMY.
3:21 Not true ... We have Tax (Value Added Tax) and it represents 15% of income
The most bullshit thumbnail 😂😂😂😂
It’s too bad we have news articles coming out in Canada stating immigrants haste it here and want to go home now.
Sorry man, but people now know the reality of Canada. It's just a shit hole
Getting successful as any country gets you hate from US people, never gets old
saudi arabia is changing its economy system to multi clean fuel projects ♥️
MAN STF4 ITS NOT SAUDI FAULT THEY HAVE OIL LIKE-
I’m from Saudi Arabia and this guy thinks he’s funny “OIL” video full of nonsense
*_OH NOE PEAK OIL!!!!!1!!1!1!!_*  the fuck, algo off today
You forgot to mention, that they didn't find it, couldn't refine it and didn't know what it could be used for.  This should be mentioned more often, as should ALL of their technical projects coming from Western tech.
Stupid…. Oil is around until technology makes something else available. Americans are already giving the middle finger to EV cars
The same words were said about oil 40 years ago. However, the demand for oil has not changed, but has increased.
You sound hater of greatness
F saudi 🤡
theres also  the massive ethical concern of working with saudi arabia...
With the mass amount of EVs being returned due to bad charging, long wait times, etc.   Then Oil is here to stay at least in a flat/stagnant way. It'll be here for a lllooonnngggg time
Great work, guys.. We need to produce and provide are owen energy
This all sounds like an Urban Planning project for college.  *_We assume resources are infinite. Thus, we can come up with random stuff!_* Amazing how monarchs still get final say on anything. World’s too modern for stuff like that.
Vision 2030 sounds like what you’d get from a school project for fifth graders with the prompt “how would you spend a trillion dollars to build a country in the desert?”
Also cultures differences let see how restricted they are with the new unrestricted. Example will bikini wearing be legal only in tourist resorts or they ne allow outside resorts. You said they allow non tourist to drink beer but that incluude native saudi as wel who aren't muslim outsite the resort or only inside.
This video is 10x the most retarded viewpoint. Oil isnt going anywhere and oil jsnt a finite resource. Same stupid argument thats been made for decades
NaIce
Those Bedouins will pay in the future for all bad thing they have done.
This is amazing, please make a video about Portugal!
bro one video about our beautiful country Nepal please
The butts hurt :)
I'm a saudi born, and a saudi citizen, ask anything :)
Yes, this is bound to be a success. When has a centrally planned economy ever failed? I'd have much more confidence if they were spending the money to provide good education and infrastructure to their citizens to let them move the economy forward
@13:13 i dont understand the problem with the winter games. Saudi Arabia isn't all desert. it has snow.
It's funny to talk about human rights when you live in America or any European country, Your state is the one that established the terrorist Israeli regime, due to which thousands of Palestinians die every day, and your state is responsible for the wars in Iraq and the human rights violations that occur there.  Our state cares about us and does not throw us into the streets like people in Las Vegas, We are satisfied with what our country offers us and we believe that it is compatible with Islamic law, which is the best way to live. I am sure that including an old topic like that issue was created only to distort the reputation.
China still builds coal plants
6:48  i wonder how many non Saudis got triggered by this
oil is definitely not done
5:49 As a Saudian whats scares me is that it is not a plan JUST A VISION;
At 1:33 you shown a map of the Persian gulf labelled incorrectly as the arabian gulf. All the atlas books refer to that body of water as the Persian gulf and it will not be changed. Also, Iran is one of the top 5 countries with the highest amount of oil and gas reserves.
1:22 The construction of buildings overlooking Mecca makes Mecca 50% less holy.
I'm noticing how well it is done everyday by sucking my wallet double then i used to.
no ones gonna go visit saudi arabia.
MBS is actually so awesome ... he is benefitting his country, and the global economy in reality. He maintains his worldview of Islam while pushing the people forward with economic benefit. So many people want to see him fail because they want to take finance from the country by toppling the government. W MBS.
This is going to be HAram to say but...looks like the Saudis are trading Mecca for Mickey Mouse?
Medicine made with oil? Clothes?
Love to 🇸🇦 from 🇮🇷
What you say might be true about Saudi being dependant on oil for their economy, but honestly if they invest carefully in the sustainable industry they will surpass the west with or without oil since they can install a moderate amount of solar panels to power their cities and obviously its extremely hot in Arabia so harnessing electrical power will be a breeze.
We've been hearing about "Peak Oil" since the 1970s. Give me a break. Fracking is just one example where new technology is turning the energy industry upside down. Who's to say that some future technology won't do the same thing. It might involve oil, gas, renewables, nuclear or something else. Don't count the future out yet.
Oil isnt done not by a long shot
" world's 2 superpowers: america and china " damn, accurate tho
Most of the saudi citizens got there degree from US,UK, and other western countries which contradicts your false info, and the private sector is dominanted by greedy unqualified foreigners westerners mostly who have failed in their countries want to make money and then go back once they get what they want. Foreigners don't even work as hard as saudi citizens do but somehow because of their nationality they have advantages over the saudi citizens tho most of them are mentally unstable
That's haram baby😢😂  Don't let me catch you doing that again little bro or else the consequences will be known when you forget to pray one day 🎉🎉🎉😢😢😊😮😊❤❤❤
OF COURSE, WE HAVE ALREADY REACHED PEAK OIL SITUATION. IF ONLY EU BECOMES WISE AND EMBRACES NUCLEAR ENERGY, OIL WILL NEVER GO BEYOND 50.. AND THAT WOULD BE GREAT FOR THE ENTIRE WORLD (WITH THE EXCEPTION OF OPEN+)... MAY BE EVEN TO THEM, AS NECESSITY IS THE MOTHER OF INVENTION, AND THEY CAN COME OUT OF OIL INDUCED HIBERNATION QUICKLY
All roads lead to saudi
BEN SALMANE THE ANTHECHRIST
Trying to base your economy from tourism is the worst idea. They need real industry, Tech or banking to stay sustainable. The fact is once Saudis run out of oil they’ll go back to a poor desert country like they were before oil.
The problem is that they are building cities and places for an era that is already ending. Nowadays kids who should be their customers have no interest in traveling into the desert dystopia. They want hang out freely in Brooklyn in garage sale t-shirt after having a locally brewed latte. This is solely designed for boomers and their idea of holidays.
Informative video, nice effort, but I have an observation , which is your use of that camel with the Saudi flag on it. I see it as  insulting, especially words that in the flag it looks  distorted . those words are considered the most important words a person can utter for us as muslims. we call it 'shahadah' and It reads: "I bear witness that there is no deity but allah (the God), and I bear witness that Muhammad is the Messenger of God." The Shahada declares belief in the oneness (tawhid) of God and the acceptance of Muhammad as God's messenger. If anyone wants to learn more,  search seriously about islam you wont't regret it
bro dropped an ad so smoothly 🤣🤣
Imagine thinking EV’s are taking over 😂😂😂😂
Move to ev is a mirage. Wake up.
Again 2030. The globalist elitists are really pushing their agenda harder and harder. I'm resisting by continuing to buy diesel cars.
6:09 Best educational institutes in the world ... for men.
Great vid. I am curious to know why 2/3rds of the saudi population are under 35 though.
I dont think many people want to move to canada lol
Hate to be the one to say it... The reputation problems Saudi faces are rooted in saudis connection to islam. The only way to rebrand would be to drop islam.
resorts, football stadiums, theatres, concert halls, video game arenas, even if they are not fiscally the right moves the bread and circus does benefit the government if they are planning to privatize their economy and taking away the people's oil money in the process
They want 100 million tourists annually, beating out the current top tourist destination, France, by an additional 20 million tourists annually? And they want to do this by 2030? Are they injecting their oil straight into their veins or what? This is the kind of shit I would come up with when I was 5 years old
Stop being so jealous about saudi arabia
Oil never running out that’s propaganda. Electric cars are done. There is no infrastructure anywhere that can power all those cars. And fossil fuels are needed to create electricity. Lithium if a conflict produced control mostly by china. This video is completely wrong
Wait wait do you like bodybuilding? I laughed so hard when you used a picture of Shaun Clarida in the first 30 seconds LMFAO
Weren't we "hitting peak oil" in like 1975?
This channel is a joke, do actual research in stead of spouting brainless US propaganda.
So, just so I'm clear on this. The US can spend 3 Trillion dollars on the ar in Iraq, but Saudi can't spend the same amount to build a whole fucking country ?  Yup sounds like western logic to me😂.
As a gulf Arab youth myself, not a Saudi tho, we share the same issues but on a smaller less acute scale because of our smaller size. For the entire neighborhood the trickiest bit would be restructuring that social contract (which I personally think is badly needed and is very long overdue) but without leaving citizens with the short end of the stick. Local authorities can't expect citizens to forgo of their oil-dependent financial safety buffers without first demonstrating shared responsibility (reducing royal court spending, tackling institutional and systemic corruption etc).
Think about what a non corrupt & crazy but coordinated  and integer world government could do with all the money aviable used for this kind of nonsense.
Prating their Ventures fail spectacularly 🙏😌
After hearing the mukaab and the line as their last ditch effort, I already know its a fucking failure lmao.
here's a joke, a blue collar saudi
They've been saying this since the 70's
Turtles
I think hoser speaks Arabic
Im from brunei and my god its like talking about brunei
you are absolutely right, last year the saudi ambassador came to my university (catolica de chile) and talked to us about the same project, mostly related to saudi becoming the nect global hub for education, sports and businesses, as you said theyre heavily investing in that, but also he explained us there must be a change in the saudi muslim society in order to achieve what they want, mainly in the areas their religion rules, to try to become less conservative in a way
can you make a video on Myanmar?
Oil isnt going anywhere for 500 years
Oil won't go. They just want to keep it for themselves (Elites). While the rest fight over charging ports to charge their cars
يابلادي واصلي 🇸🇦
Sad that you believe all these non sense. Saudi Arabia will be the heart of Islamic world, the bridge that connect Asia with Africa and Europe. Oil is something temprorary like everything, and still there alternative energy resources, wind and sun for example and another valuable resources. I feel most of the commenters are hoping bad thing to the country 🌝, and let us be honest about it, nothing will happen to Saudi Arabia, it is already very rich.
Oil drives the war machine so oil is far from done.
In regards of tax we do have it now unfortunately
Short anything these morons touch.
NEOM makes not even the slightest sense, not even the slightest bit but they are still spending money on it
They will not host winter olympic games my friend. They just pulled a fast one on you.  They are in a desert.
this whole civilization is built on steal and Oil... we run out of Oil = the fall of this civilization as we knew it. yah, renewable energy sound good and all, but sorry to say it will not run this civilization. what happen in 20,30,40 years, only God knows... but don't expect good thing when Oil runs out.
As a Saudi we all invest in crypto, gold and global market "passive income"
Hi I am very happy for them, but I still need super help with money, with all there money they are throwing away. I will need some of that money so I can get back into school, if they wish to please do so, I will be very happy.
World Class Animation. 🤣🤣
If someone is watching 20 years from now, the world will still be commiting suicide by oil
hearing you guys crying from the comment section is just amusing to me,  keep it going… 😂
Only naive people think human oil dependence could end in the 21 century
Greattings from The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia i want to say something as a Saudi citizen, hoser your very well educated, yet you have a Western disorder which unables you from looking at any other none western country with a positive manner and I understand that, I have been to America and I've studied there for a while, but as an advice do not overuse the word oil to get to your point and if you do have a point then express it by using a variety of carefully selected words therefore to convince your audience, clearly your aim is just getting some more views, by taking advantage of people emotions over the current situation of the gas prices and making a video with some ignorant surface google searches about Saudis oil and Saudis vision backing it with low resolution images to demonstrate the so called third world country
When you have more money than sense
Tallest buildings! The prophet prophesied the end of times  "and when you see barefoot, naked, destitute shepherds competing in constructing tall buildings."
May god bless Saudi Arabia 🇸🇦🤍 hope you all come and visit and see Saudi for yourself, don’t believe the bad media propaganda
These fools lost to yemeni sandal warriors. All that empty bravado goes out the window when they dont got the military might for it.
So they are trying to become...Dubai? ahah
As a Muslim you can’t use our holy words on elephant. Please remove or change your thumbnail thankyou.
You should've named him MBSH Lolll
nobody wants to go to a desert lol
Sounds like the Deus group.
Who is going to defend Saudi Arabia.   With the exit of the US let them rely on the Israelis.
"buying Reynoldo" is crazy 😭
Vision 2030 is based on three basic axes: a vibrant society, a prosperous economy, and an ambitious nation, and 96 detailed goals emerge from it.  I don’t know why content creators like to show only tourism projects, even though there are many industrial, logistical, agricultural, and environmental projects, and projects that aim to raise the quality of life, and also rank 3 Saudi cities among the top 100 cities in the world!
That WarThunder promotion in the middle made me laugh hard 🤣🤣🤣
Watch this end up being a colossal waste. Hasn't the war in Ukraine proved that, yet?  Europe claimed to have renewable energy, and their grid collapsed in a few days. Renewables just don't have the necessary energy density to be good for much. Sine Saudi Arabia doesn't have nuclear reactors, their best bet would be to invest in more petroleum exploration and making synthetic oil cheaper. Really, that's everyone's best bet, but almost every country is too politically dumb to pursue that, so they'd have an advantage if they tried.
I’ve been to Saudi. I can tell you rn that Saudi isn’t going anywhere for a while.
oil ain’t going anywhere for at least 100 years
20 years ago they told us we can only be extract oil for 60 years and then it will be all gone! now, they still say the same story with the same numbers! hahahaha
As an average person I am not sure if "oil is done" is reality or media hype. Electrification still has a way to go and is primarily making inroads in compact cars market. SUV , Trucks and bigger transportation is still dominated by ICE. What about heavy industry. Not all oil is used by cars. It might test OPEC's strategy of cutting output if demand reduces a bit and other countries increase their production but I see oil around for 30-40 years. Even longer.
Can you talk about egypt and the economic crisis also the future of its vision
Going use less oil for cars gas? Using ev? Hell no
The only people who don't like Saudi Arabia are non Saudi Arabia residents . I think we are the only country that will stand up with our kingdom .🤣🤣
"We have big opportunities in front of us in different sectors and we have to exploit them to continue to grow and prosper," he said on the Liwan Al Mudaifer Show.
Under the Vision 2030 plan, Prince Mohammed has brought in several multibillion-dollar projects to put Saudi Arabia on the map for innovation, tech and youth-driven initiatives.
Can you make another video about the philippines because the economic of the philippines currently is rising?
Salam, Luxury is FORBIDDEN in Al Quran.. The prince is doing the opposite of Al Quran.
If you’re gonna depict the Saudi flag at least get the writing right out of respect cause it’s a religious text.
16:54 It wasn't illegal to begin with btw
Why does nobody ever mention that the USA ALSO has one of the worlds largest natural gas reserves AND crude oil reserves???
I say to every doubter you will see after 10 years that everything Prince Mohammed planned will come true just wait
MBS is a shit ruler that only cares about monies
How hard is it to hit the include pain promotion button? Gotta thumbs down and not rec channel if you can't do the due diligence then why would anyone trust the rest of your video
I could tell just another video made for likes and subscribes. Move your axx to Saudi and make a real video.
As Saudi It's laughable that who rate our projects in these comments half of them are ppl lives poorer then us and the other half is also poorer but with pedo president .
"will run out of by 2050" lol keep waiting. It's not even 2150
18:30 innuvuhtuv
Arab countries gonna go broke
The older i get the less i believe in unrenewable energy Its gotta be renewable because when i was in 5th grade my science book said we only have enough oil to last us til 2020 now we have 60 more years basically its unlimited as there is no way to know when the last Barrell will be
awwww so no more Instagram models for them to pee on.  Nobody is going to travel to a place where you cant be yourself.  Dont do this dont do that, but yet they come here, and they can do whatever they want.
not sure they are gonna get their tourism if they keep building these ugly by the numbers modern tech cities, instead of building some fantasy muslim civilization city akin to old baghdad
2026: Saudi Arabia announces plans to build thneedville
Saudi projects really remind me of the great projects of old, like the pyramids and the Great Wall of China. And I don’t mean that in a good way.
What BS you always say and yet oil keeps climbing and in need? 😂  I only came to hate Saudi for tacitly supporting genocide in Gaza. Filthy blood soaked Prince ruler.
03:21 sorry brother but they have taxs and almost homeless let alone work as slaves. that oil? ha it wont go to the people but people of top and USA
15:30 used to be accurate lol, but we’re TOO open now with our liberal government and they don’t know how to manage spending and an economy so it’s insanely expensive to live here
The main thing about the Saudis' plans is that, for the most part, they're terrible. Their megaprojects are idiotic, their investments are too spread out, it's all lights and smoke but very little infrastructure. Even the Education sector, in which they have invested heavily, is hampered by their own fundamentalist approach to Islam.  The worst part is that they could feasibly make a lot of stuff work. Their Red Sea shore has a (very) warm climate, reefs and beaches that would make for a very good Riviera, a tourism magnet not unlike its Egyptian counterpart. They're in a prime location to become a transportation hub, with access to two different bodies of water. They have very cheap energy, thanks to their equally cheap oil. But instead of tried-and-true economic investments, they're building the ugliest cube possible, a pointless line, and a bunch of other projects that make no sense and only people who like Dubai would visit.  And, like, people who like Dubai can go to Dubai.
this just sounds like he wants saudi to tun secular.. im not gainst tho, go MBS
0:51 what is this map? It shows saudi Arabia having 0 oil 🤨
average westerner this guy almost made it seem as if saudis being so fkn rich that they can invest in everything as preparation for a day where oil is not a profitable as it is now is today a bad thing 💀💀 but again that's what their news feeds them "arabs bad, west good" yall can keep sinking into debt and degeneracy, your empire is already decaying 🫡
Those puppets of the oil industry don't have a change.
You can’t buy your way out of every problem.
U do NOT want a country ran by commodities... the money is spent on entertainment and it hollows your countries education and manufacturing, its called dutch disease
There is one big issue that Saudis don't realize. I've heard of tourists that visiting Dubai with your wife is fun, same applies for Abu Dhabi and Qatar. Saudi Arabia on the other hand is religiously too strict to welcome international tourists. They need a change in culture if they want to attract Western tourists.
💎💎
They build everything with slavery and people died building the world cup. It's cool they wanna build things but death and slavery aren't.  Looks like ill be pirating many future sports events. Not supporting this shit.
The amount of ignorance this guy has about our economy...
Their idea of freedom is being Dubai 2.0. How about you teach your people how to do some actual work & create value instead of taking the gimmick route with projects like the line?
As a Saudi, let me till you that the people are not benefitting, infact it is getting worse for us, everything cost the duble yet payment ladder has not changed from the 70s also 15% tax is to much.
Gambling? Haram
Oil isnt going to go away shut up bro. you probasbly have calls on renewable energy or some shit lmfao
If they just focused on Muslim and Arab tourism they would be the number 1 destination in the world .  If they only looked in their own backyard instead of trying to be like the west and Dubai there would be people buying second homes on the huge cost line.  400 million Arabs and 1.5 billion Muslims world wide with every Muslim obligated to visit by religious decree they don’t know what they have infront of them.  I would think it’s the west telling them what there allow to build and what they can spend on. Evidence is 95% of Arabia’s wealth is invested in the west and in western corporations, land, investments etc.
You swallowed the propaganda. Virtually none of these things will ever be build, least of all the line, which is a scam even bigger than elmo's hyperloop.  Scam. You fell for a scam.
I'm halfway through the video, it's pretty informative however I cannot ignore how condescending it feels.
You looked for the highest education in Africa Gabon just to try and compare to the average Saudi to imply they are not educated, also, the data is from 2015.the average saudi back then was like 15 years old  we get paid to go to university, I literally don't know a single person without a bachelor's we also have scholarship programs free for gifted students to go study abroad. 10% of our budget goes to education.  Look up the highest rated universities in the middle east, all of them are in Saudi Arabia  We're not perfect, there is a lot to go through but education is not remotely one of our weaknesses
You forgot to mention that we ARE hosting Riaydh EXPO 2030 too 😎
Nice title considering Gambling is considered to be haram and banned in the country. XD
9/11
Anyone noticed that the electric vehicle demand is collapsing, and only ONE electric vehicle company is profitable... Even with Bidens subsidized push. Global warming ..... I remember when I was a kid, they sold fear in the form of Acid rain. Oil isn't going anywhere.
There are fewer times when you feel lucky not being in place of Trillionare , this one is one of those fewer times..
as somebody who lives in saudi, the line isnt the only thing thats being made, there are i think currently 4 mega projects including the line and 2 of them (oxagen and the islands) are already quite doable, the islands are actually probably almost done now, at least the first one. the line is too far but eh lets see.
Saudis wanting to diversify their GDP through tourism is a joke. Who will go for vacations to a backwards society with terrible weather and listening all day long someone shouting from a minaret?
mbs is a cancer on mankind
My problem with saudi is that they need to fix their problem with human rights/jailing people for basically nothing/islamist extremists. Until they fix that im never stepping foot in a single arab country
Saudi Arabia has been riding the easy and free life by purchasing foreign labor with its free money from oil. Do you think all those uneducated unskilled Saudi Arabians are going to suddenly be able to produce a competitive product or service to the rest of the world? They're going to need to invest in some really big freezer units if they want to get hell to freeze over.
That Camel looks just amazing.
Peak oil. Bwhahahahaha! You go, my guy!
Can you do something about Morocco cuz like I love your channel you know 👁👄👁❤🤝
You have over half a million subs. Buy a bloody pop-sheild!
Yeah 2030 is crazy lol they’ve already progressed so much
You never mentioned their invite and acceptance into BRICS+ and what that will mean for them all. Another video incoming?
phasing out oil will be catastrophic for the ME/Arab World. It is essentially a guaranteed world war trigger as mass famine and collapsing  dynasties start to lash out. And it wont take long once the industry starts to decline. Small perturbations have already produced issues.    Combine that with the prospect of much of Africa collapsing because of various things, environmental issues, economic woes (especially debt to china vs Europe), corruption, despotism being the ones I think of, and people in the west are suddenly going to have to think reaaaaaal hard about who is the in group.
Saudi makes $ 1billion from oil everyday. For 5 years, that's $1.8 trillion. The house of Saud is worth$1.4 trillion. Do you know how to do maths?
Saudi had corruption. They recovered $100 billion from it.
Why are the Saudis soo disgustingly insulted? Don’t you use oil? They make $1 billion per day, that's 365 billion dollars per year. Do you see how foolish you are? Even onlyfans don't make that amount of money.
Я не хочу иметь детей. Никогда»  Лоле 33 года. Еще в ранней юности она осознала, что не хочет иметь детей. Обдуманное и взвешенное решение вызывает массу вопросов и критики в ее адрес. Меня надо остановить
Just one wrong thing. We ain't gonna run out of oil any time soon or in the next 100 years.
So, the Saudi's solution to the problem being discussed is... To throw money at it in random and haphazardous ways and hope for the best? This, is never going to end well at all.
People of saudi don't know meaning of work, suffering.  😂😂.
remember brothers, gamble is haram
Hunger is not a sign that it is God who is dealing with you. Scripture also said " a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the arms so shall poverty come upon you like a Bandit. That is why we need knowledge of saving and investment. It is advisable not to eat our tomorrow and the future of our children today...
He is pushing for many things that doesn't fit with their position for Muslims "Makah and Medina" and it's history. They are doing many things that goes against Islam and this is defiantly is going to back fire on the government in the future. What kept their family leading are the religious ppl otherwise they wouldn't stay till now. He is going to fail so hard and if he continued as he is doing, his ppl are going to kick him and his family out, it's only a matter of time.
Well done and thank you!
Lol.  This is the doubt button》
you can make a paper out of this, damn dude very well done
Not true. Just AI tech alone will take 25% of all available energy and current rates in just 3 years.
All these plans are hatched up to funnel petro dollars into princes' and their jewish friends accountd in USA and UK.
Bro, almost had me with that ad, I thought a crucial component of the game was going to be needing to pay for oil😂
they will do it and accomplish their vision ..carry on watching how they will  progress, bottom line and the to tjeir advantage is that they have and still produce the cheapest oil also they have the $$$
And Saudi has a growing political importance now. Saudi's biggest competitors in supplying Europe, Russia and Iran, have raised their threats on the West. Russia took a gamble invading Ukraine once they completed Nordsream 2, but that didn't go as planned, and now Russia and Iran are increasingly cut off from supplying the west. And as they are doubling down on opening new fronts of violence (e.g. Hamas, Hizballah, and elsewhere), Saudi's importance as an oil supplier to the West is becoming even MORE important.
People have been fooled it'd great to visit 🇸🇦 just don't go being disrespectful ❤🇸🇦🦾😇
Hello!  it’s for your knowledge. You can not paste their flags on animals because it contains names of our beloved prophet and God. It is considered blasphemy. Kindly change it.
Only collapsibles will be those who choose to be against Multi Polarity ♥️🇸🇦🦾😇👋
Oil is a mineral. There is so much of it out there that the oil companies had to convince the world that it is a finite resource to keep the price high.
Oil is most definitely not done. Power grids will not be able to handle everybody charging their cars simultaneously, so oil and coal will always be the backup power source to generate electricity because it's easy to store and it can sit on the shelf for years and then be used at any time.
We are all bound to fade into irrelevance......
Looks like no Ev's or Tesla's in Arabia.
The world is in boycott mode.
انت ما تحب السعوديه 🇸🇦
Must be nice to be young and stupid I remember peak oil in the seventies
3 Trillion is actually CHEAP..the US government gave away more than 15 trillion in 2020/2021. SA could spend 10 Trillion easily, and it's all gonna' work out.
Idk about that. Aspirin and all that has a chemical that naturally occurs when the drug is made that’s also in crude oil. They don’t need each other. However missals drones jets anything that does with killing people and waging war needs crude oil. The military is also RESISTANT towards EVs and anything to do with renewable energy. The US military extensively built solar panels wind mills etc in Iraq (in the green zone funny enough) and Afghanistan. In this documentary called “this is what winning looks like” they show what happened to the billions of solar panels at these bases. No one’s there to manage them and eventually they build and hook everything on generators that uses. Crude oil. Developing nations also for the most part will use crude oil until people stop leaving this counties we are experts in those fields (brain drain is a real problem)
The fact that people are stupid enough to think these oil alternatives are viable is exactly what is wrong with the west, 100% a result of having no real problems.
It would be cheaper going to Mars than cutting oil dependence...
Nothing on earth can make me play war thunder ever again. Great video tho!
Please make I video about seria
What's that animal that represents the EU?  Bison = U.S., Panda = China, Camel (Dromader) = KSA.
Imagine the country making money instead of robbing it from the citizens to spend
money can't buy brains
"you are me" nice one
Shit that'll never happen for 500:
please make a video about egypt
As long as we have America in the top of the world, it’s impossible to get rid of oil ! America’s green toilet paper is used in every country in the world thanks to the petrodollar deal with Saudi government. If oil becomes irrelevant to the world it means the dollar too which means the Americans cannot print money as much as they want without catastrophic consequences which means the end of the US economy which means the end of this so called civilized world, we are doomed anyway 😂
Wtf is Arabian gulf that you're showing on your map? That's Persian gulf
We’ve been hearing that oil would run out for decades. When I got my license in 2001 we were supposed to run out by 2010.
Subhanallah Alhamdulillah La ilaha illallah Allahu Akbar Allah Hu Akbar sallallahu alaihi vasllam sallallahu alaihi vasllam
why the fk u think that world will use less oil in 10-30 years? Every year world uses more and more oil.
The world is very Jealous of Saudis being uneducated, ignorant people, adding no skills to a knowledgeable society, yet so Rich just because their LAND is full of OIL.  What the world needs to understand is that it is Saudi'sLand that is directly responsible for all the growth and prosperity the West can achieve. So, a big Thank you to all Saudis for letting Western machinery pump this oil cheaply enough so that the whole world can afford the food on the table. There are different angles to understanding a country, community, and culture.
The Line is a particularly stupid idea. To get from A to B, you might have to travel half the length of the city. Saudi brand: murder.
Peak oil in every imaginable way is never going to happen. Not even peak oil production. What some people try to promote is peak oil will to obtain and use oil. Countries that promote stopping using oil are going to become failed nation states.
Oil will not be done. The alternative to oil is nothing but a joke. All the hype about electric cars and alternative energy is nothing but a joke. Electric cars they do not work in all kind of weather that’s first.. Second, disposing of batteries and batteries related components are more toxic to environment hundred times more than oil .. all those people investing in alternative energy. I wish you good luck. It’s nothing but a scam.
Please direct viewers how they contribute to weakening Israeli brands like WIX and FIVERR...: 1 search for these brands by Google -2 press the links of the announcements made in social media whenever they appear for you. like this the algorithms will direct them to you again and again and don't stop clicking on the brand links. like this, with a large number of these brands' advertising budget will be lost to unwanted audiences
@h0ser why are you using a propaganda map with "arabian gulf", while that body of water has been called Persian Gulf for over 2500 years? I unsubscribed.
4:40 all tanki online players got MAJOR flashbacks on this timestamp....
It's an evil place.
This will fail.  Tourism/entertainment/service economies are no substitute for digging a resource out of the ground and making new things with it.
Shittest plug I've ever heard. At least try and sound like you're not reading from a script.
bro every media outlet talks like saudi is gonna collapse stop being jealous of saudi n focus on ur snowflake ideals
sooo what you're saying is that investing in your own country is a bad thing. well, it makes sense why the US is swimming in its own debt if that's the way Americans think lol
Like a future fund like Norway
There trade imbalance is dramatic so the more they spend the better for the world economy
MAKE A VIDEO ON OMANNN I WOULD PAY TO WATCH IT
Oil and pharmacy
China fits exactly none of the criteria required to be considered a superpower. Never was one, never will be..
Sorry, kids. Its over. 😂
lmao peak production was reached in 2017, it's all going down hill from here
Your video is based on what some guy thinks will happen over a decade from now?  Government doesn’t drive the world. Innovation does. You’re a dummy.
These commie idiots with turn our world into disaster.
17:02 it’s not true 🔴🔴🔴🔴
That 17:27 SAYS A LOT. Shoutout to the rentiers. You're as useless as you can be, I would rather have you guys stay at home and just collect your paycheck.
Burying Dollars in the desert sand, hoping a Dollartree will grow.
1 trillion to 10% (dividends plus course wins) = 100 Billion a year as revenue.
The emirates invest in AI this is extremely smart. Sam Altmsn asks for 8 trillion and UE can provide
I believe the EV stuff when you can build nuclear reactors.
Take off, eh?
I am muslim and I'd never go to Saudi Arabia for tourism!
Nothing replaces it
Well researched video
Im surprised you left out they're heavily invested in Hydrogen with the Neom Green Hydrogen Company.  Probably the biggest producing hydrogen plant in the world.  I like the idea of a hydrogen driven economy rather than an electric one, but they are facing the same issues as the EV vehicles faced when they started, hoping they are able to scale and get costs down in the future.
lol electric cars are not going to save the west
Nothing lasts forever- including oil.  They did not share it to others- but only for their excesses.  Goodbye Saudi.
nice video. also nice ad segway
It is only peace, cooperation, collaboration and innovation that all nations can survive and thrive this world problem of increase cost of fossil energy.
Oil is plenty. Greed makes it seem so close to "running out". If companies go back to glass, metal packing and cotton/linen clothing the world would be better and cleaner. But doing all that will hurt the feelings of the shareholders, bankers and big corporations (they would not earn trillions just billions so sad and pity). All that "electric" is a golden promise just for more population control...
Can you make a vid about North Korea.
Yeah well, the world is dumb AF. Canada wants to go electric by 2035 too, it is completely impossible. Renewables are just a huge scam.
Just Stop Oil is a Scam, paid for and funded by interest groups
total bullshit we will be using a lot of oil into the future - after billions invested unprofitably and 50 years of technology, oil use went down 5%
Saudi Arabia will have to bend on a lot of their religious rules in order to get those tourist numbers, and get rid of the wahabists. Will tell you what they think about religion deep down. How will Islam face the world after its holiest country and leaders become less religious?
Hey man atleast change the thumbnail or get the flag right. It contains holy wording in Arabic and it ain’t cool to make it look nonsensical.
The need for oil isn't going anywhere. If anything there will be more demand but less supply which would leave SA at a massive advantage.
You are wrong in so many regards: 1. Oil "isn't" finite. It is the 2nd abundant liquid on planet Earth, after Water. 2. Noone is trying to distance themselves from Oil. They just want to stabilize the ever growing demand to it at some very high point. They have OPEC who stabilizes the price as well, so all good for oil makers. 3... I wrote the previous 2 points at 1 minute marker of your video. If you are going to use word "fossil fuel" anywhere in this video, here goes the last pointer: Oil has nothing to do with Fossils.
It actually isn't finite.  That is the lie that has always been sold.
If the armed forces stopped using oil for their wars  The General  Public could use less oil but still keep oil in production   The climate would gradually adjust   The fossil fuel companies should rethink its  arms  companies   use of oil ‼️👍🤔🙏🏻
Peak Oil Demand - No chance of that.  You can't plant enough cropland for renewable fuels to dent oil demand.  Electric vehicles?  See "Lutton car park fire" - 1,200 cars destroyed AND the building.  Who will insure these rolling fire bombs in future?
Green cars only by 2035 is a pipe dream.
What he's gambling on is the fact that through these jobs and the created infrastructure, firms and individuals needed to maintain it will still be around, and the various sectors this builds up will become self-sustaining.  It wouldn't be the first time in US history something like this happened.  The CA gold rush drove 300,000 people to California.  local pop increased from 92k in 1850 to 370k in 1860.
This idiot plugged his sponsor pretty quick. This is what this damn video is, the preamble to a commercial, and the commercial. Period. I wasted my time here.
We will definitely be using the same amount and even more oil than we do now. Wind is a joke. Solar is a joke, also super radioactive with no protection. Nvm northern climates. The future is oil, nuclear, and coal.
Hey at least they are trying. Instead of spending money on lambos and yachts
Yo channg your thumbnail dont put the (Shahada) the Islamic testament of faith on any living being or camel for that matter😠
So much bad info in this video. Look up art Berman nate hagens if you want a better understanding of fossil fuels.
Great video mate.  Gary Coventry UK
There's nothing this country can do to bring tourists in a terrorist country ran by slavery
I would move to Saudi instead of Canada every single day of the year.
oil is infinitely renewable...stfu..
electric motors are insanely inefficient and the CO2 stuff is a hoax. There are gasses that are harmful and outright destructive to the ozone layer but not CO2.
Honduras mentioned at 8:00 and you got our colors right nice! :D
Good luck with Islamic intellectualism, I heard that works really well. And assuming u pull it off, then good luck keeping the monarchy.
Oil is infinite btw
I was always wondering what could happen underground when tons and tons of oil are sucked out, it will leave a massive empty void that could collapse and sink half the country!
Nah, oil will be around until the very last drop
Petrochemicals derived from oil and natural gas make the manufacturing of over 6,000 everyday products and high-tech devices possible. It's far from over.
Oil is done --------------unsuscribed
can u do pls an episode about morocco
Hmm, just looking at Saudi bond ratings/rates, I can already tell whatever you're saying makes the video's title clickbait bullshit, so disliked
There is a problem in Arabia most people don't know, is in the culture itself they treat themselves as superior than any other person on earth. Even other muslims. In Mekka, the first row of muslims close to the stone is dedicated solely to "Saudi by birth", and they chase any other muslims. A closed culture never makes it to the top. Only an open one does, look at the US or EU.
Here's the kicker. How do you think electric cars are made? With Air? And how would you charge the batteries running these vehicles? They all need Energy=OIL.
We have been predicting "peak oil" since it was first discovered.
They got so much money, that they waste it for BS their luxury desert projects (that fail horribly).  As a Christian I'm sorta happy to see that they can't use money the right way to establish world dominance, but boy the way they waste money really  shows how much of a primate being just lucky they are.
هممممم
It’s crazy how biased influencers are against us. Calls the public investment fund the “oil fund,” just shows deserts; equivalent of calling the Edo monarchy of Japan the sardine monarchy then proceeding to just show trees in city or town outskirts instead of any of the nation’s architecture.
We are not going to be using less oil. EV's won't reduce oil need because most countries can't/won't build nuclear power plants. That's even if most will  buy EV's with all their issues. Problem is you need power plants to supply power to EV's...  World needs to find actual products that can replace all the oil products. Good luck to us.
saudi arabia is the biggest monoculture town ever. and their only other product is hate.
This whole sports washing and wanting tourists to come to Saudi Arabia   As long as they are a backward theocracy where they mess around with people and atheists literally have a death punishment I don't really know what they want.  I wouldn't go to Saudi Arabia for vacation even if they pay me. I'm not even willing to out my feet into that country . They need a huge wave of secularization or they will collapse
I like how they plan on offering flying race cars, like in Star Wars. Must be all those Saudi scientists and engineers working overtime.
Speaking of Saudi not having the best “human rights record” I wonder what human rights abuses you’re talking about beside Kashugi case which is an incident not human right matter. Western propaganda media have worked relentlessly on the defamation of Saudi Arabia for political goals while the country having the lowest crime rate, free education and healthcare, generally satisfied citizens, and a functioning society. What the hell are you smoking?
Nonsense. Oil consumption is increasing, and all the windmills and the solar cells and the electric cars, are hardly even making a dent in the curve. Green energy is a scam: they want to sell hippie energy stock to your pension fund and get you to sell them your petro assets.
2 decades ago at University I was told that by 2020, all the oil will be used up.... Today the countries that don't have it are failing and more is being found regularly.
Imagine we stopped war and started doing this
This is such a small thing but how did you make the sponsor colour bar multicoloured and shrink nonlinearly 🤯
1/2 of the population works in public services? no tax pay?  What kind of BS is this? Where are the source of this info?
There is more than sufficient oil for everyone and for the next 300 years for the entire planet. We are not running out of oil. There is plenty. By that time new engines and fuel technologies will be well developed.
So, All-In Oil by 2028? Diamond hands, and such? Stonks, to the moon?
this country is a joke
Oil will always be in demand! Second Saudi doing a lot of investment in way so many things, do your research well 👀
WHEN YOU SHOW THE TANK AT 4:41 FROM TANKI ONLINE IT BROUGHT BACK SO MUCH MEMORIES LOL 🙂
Untortunately the country is an absolute desert, even weeds cant grow naturally. They can try anything but it will be an uphill battle as the desert will always win
i dont know i think that u hate that?
saudi arabia r smart at useing oil
Oil is  way more than 70% of Saudis exports the substances in the following blocks are basically just oil in a different form
did someone say oil?🦅🦅🦅
As a Saudi, thank you. Most people display this problem in an extremely racist demeanor, blindly hating on us for trying to do what’s right. You, however, are displaying it in an honest way. Not sugarcoating it, not blindly hating on it, just being honest. Sub earned.
perfect, everything going as planned
ياليل الهوس ماله نهاية
so the super powers hate Arabs, Not that they care  about the enviroment .New energy control supremacy.
2050 is not that far off
No chance people are trying to move to Canada
i believe it would help if they did more for human rights to attract people
Peak Oil - where have I heard that LIE before?
SA's problem:  lazy citizens
Hope these Middle Ages goes back to  milking camels again .
Strikes me that using oil profits for a bunch of vanity projects isn't a great idea. They should just do what Norway does.
As a Saudi, I have never understood these projects. The expectations are not only unrealistic but not worth it in the long run
0:52 Your map of oil reserves only covers land accessed oil, and disregards the thousands of platforms out in oceans and seas, whose oil reserves are not shown; nor does it in any way prove Colonel Fletcher Prouty wrong, if you'll forgive my slightly misallocated burden of proof.
Basically they are screwed, they'd be better off buying more habitable countries or taking them by force and building there.
The line is a joke.
can you do a video about why cost of living is so high in Accra, Ghana?
MMBS- Murderer MBS
Anything for clicks
i never heard anyone transition into an ad so smoothly in my life thats a damn talent lol
HERA?
I heard lots of stuff going on in Canada economic stand wise, what happened to them hoser
I heard their next building is so tall you can see the whole desert
Not one really feels sorry for the Saudis. They are so engrossed in their comfortable living to even consider non-Saudis as human.
It is better if they invested theirs oil money in education at the first point!  And tourism doesn't really make your country rich! But industry is the one! And make trade by it! I'm serious that education is more important than building a tower or...  Motivating their citizens to become engineers and with more developed stuffs in all the fields ... Anyway we will see how the Saudis can manage that but i probably think they get a help from the Americans when they need to! Time will show the results
A Saudi Prince: My grandfather rode a camel My father drove a car I drive a Ferrari My son will ride a camel
The PGA LIV merger is way different then wheat people originally thought it was going to be.
Well the investment fund is a good idea, look at Norway fund. O always said that i like Norwya because they kept humble after the oil, its like they guy that wins the lottery and keeps is day job, no artificial palm tree islands and crazy stuff like that. If you have a desert make a oasis dont need to make a sky resort.
For this to work, they need to suck up to the West. And in this political climate it's a tall order.
You can’t take a country seriously where women can’t drive and women have to wear hijabs everywhere. It’s an apartheid state where specific races don’t have the same opportunities. It’s not a democracy and they still do public caning. They are a parody of the 20th century and nobody should ever visit that evil country. They want to encourage tourism but you can’t just go visit the country since it’s closed to the world.

Investing in Blackrock, Vanguard as well as FAANG, is redundant; all of those massive hedge or mutual fund companies plow their funds into same companies. There are more investment firms on stock markets than companies providing services or creating products. SA should consider massive moonshot R&D: letting scientists or hobbyists experiment and make new discovers or inventions.
Urban explorers will have a field day exploring all these abandoned megaprojects in the middle of the desert.
The bigger they are, the harder they fall
All these ideas are crap because they do not really benefit anyone.
Content by kids... for kids.
There are no STEM engineers from Saudi.   Few at best.   The populace is very poorly educated, far from dedicated.   Saudi is in for some tough times.
Crazy how much leeway they have to be so undeducated with no other exports.
Man, SA will become a something like an post apocalyptic planet full of artifacts left behind, they have no chance against global warming, they are done and cannot really do anything about it, kinda sad waste of resources.
they have to change that country name first:  'SAUDI = DISGUSTING'🤣😝🤪😝
So you're saying Saudi wants to be UAE?
Saudi Arabia should learn to sustain themselves, no slave labor, no hypothetical tourist $$$, but I'm afraid they're way too lazy for that.
All of Saudi's projects are going to fail and oil isn't going anywhere.
Yea, Right!  I saw your map and Canada has a lot of Oil and LNG.  Really!!!  Canada has 33.0 Trillion of natural resources.   UAE is smart they are investing 7 trillion into AI.  Saudi Arabia - who know their plan.  They came from the desert and they will return to the desert.
How do you develop your high-tech industries if your citizens are such uneducated? Depend exclusively on foreign top talents and paying them huge amounts?
Oil is here to stay
so.... the bankrupt us is envious
The content shift was interesting
The whole assumption that we (humans) will be using 'less' oil in the near-future is complete nonsense.  ALL of Africa is still up and coming, as is India, Indonesia, all of South America.  Those places ALL need energy, they will ALL continue to improve (enrich their citizens) which will result in larger car and transportation needs.  AND all of the world consumes more than ever.  Literally everything is made of oil (plastics - I'm talking about plastics).  There is NO end to oil in the near future, nor is there genuine desire or quality of life improvements coming from ending oils.  Think about what "plastics" include:  your top tier health care is based around plastics (whether that's an iv drip or a petry dish growing anti-biotics); the water in your home comes through plastic pipes; the clothes you wear (anything polyester, rayon, etc is PLASTIC); the fresh food in the grocery store, wrapped in plastic so that you can eat cucumbers from the other side of the world when it's the dead of winter in Canada.  OIL IS NECESSARY and ever-increasing.
oil is not fossile and not peak. its abiotic and an endless resource
The comments are hilarious, Can't wait to the near future when my country is on the top of the world
You are absolutely right. I run my home generator with nuclear power.
Total nonsense - the world will be using MORE oil in 2050 than today
I am guessing its to late for Africa to start selling oil then ... Id be interested to see a video on Africa can finally achieve financial success in the global market. Where there's a lower demand for oil. obviously they have all their other minerals but will the bad leaders and the west allow the people of Africa to utilize their natural god gifted recourses.
0:22😅
The sons and daughter of the abused migrant workers will have a lot to say about the likes of Saudi Arabia, UAE, Qatar and so on.
The line is such a hilarious awful idea
as a gay guy who was born in riyadh and spend his fist 35 years investing in it . i lost everything and kicked out of the country becouse of my identity . who else wanna give a try ?
This “gamble”is already working buddy, most of the country’s income has been from VAT and corporate taxes and non oil profits are growing each year so keep malding
The only thing they are not investing in is minds! They want to pay others to build and solve all thier problems! It's like paying someone to do your homework but you still graduated, so now you are  graduated but know nothing! It's like painting a rock with gold.. It's now more shiny and it could deceive people to think it is gold but it is a usless rock! A useless rock can't change anything!
Disparate megalomaniac pointless projects. Now I see it clear: Saudi Arabia is absolutely doomed.
I may not entirely agree with the contents of this video, but i do wanna thank you for putting in the effort to pronounce the names right and write on the flag correctly enough (at least the first time).
In 10-20 years the consumption of oil, petroleum will drop with 80%
what u mean abaria golf wrong, its persian golf
That ad plug was extra grim this time, dude.
The World is moving back to the Ice Age. Electric cars have already proven that they're powerless against ice and extreme cold weather. Oil is indespensible. It's highly oil importing, industrial countries that are campaining for electric cars and campaining against fuel cars !
Just don't get raped in Saudi Arabia
The Chad investing your entire economy in massive risky megaprojects vs the virgin growing small and medium businesses and local education. Everyone knows strong nations are built like structures, top heavy with weak foundations makes a successful and mighty country  Edit: I tend to think of Saudi Arabia as "That Muslim autocracy that funds violent terrorists across the Muslim world" Perhaps if it had used its power and wealth to stabilise the middle east and advocate for enlightened despotism it may have garnered more western sympathy  As it stands I imagined if I went there I'd be arrested for being gay, disrespecting one of their customs inadvertently or being priced out of one of their absurdly expensive and tacky needle towers
These people have been fattened up with endless money - there is no escape
Saudi biggest opponent is time, they are a bit late to the game. King Fahad (rest in peace) while he made Saudi formidable internationally but was a bit tough domestically.
Oil will be more demanded with all the wars in the near future
Yo  you gotta update that map.... there isn't an "Arabian Gulf" anywhere in the world....  what you're showing there is called the Persian Gulf.
14:14 5 trillion needs one more zero
Are you being paid by the Saudi Royal family to get us to buy into the new Saudi brand?
Why Saudi is targeted with khashogi and America is not with Julian assange and much much worse war crimes
Saudi is mostly desert but there is green in some areas
Aweful channel
Building is one thing. Managing and maintaining is another.
If i were MBS i would try to turn Saudi Arabia into an agricultural & renewable energy superpower given its large landmass. Think he and his country are spending their money a bit poorly.
We hit peak oil at around 2000. Peak demand isnt important, we are already running out, and with increasing usage itll be all out within a century
Saudi Arabia will need a green means to containt this renewable energy, check out what Vanadium batteries do they're insane if the fact that they have infinite recharge cycles unlike lithium. Saudi Arabia is looking to source Vanadium by any means, check our the latest MOU Saudi Arabia signed up with Surefire Resources.
Why would I choose Saudi when I enjoy some vices? Ibiza, Thailand, New Zealand are waaay more liberal and I won't be stoned to death for doing something "naughty". Also not a fan of sand
SAUDI should have exuted those plans at least 40 yrs ago.   Now   It is too little too late
Iran, Russia, have a lot also
Contract workers is a funny way of saying slave
China superpower? When ?
Collapse by Michael C Rupert is a must watch documentary
We hit peak oil in 2006 didn’t we
Make a video on India
Terrorist settlers colonist bloodline want to control oil
PEAK OIL IS ALOMOST HERE!!!!  Meanwhile, oil, stocks, go📈
Oil is not done.
Remember that Top Gear episode when they were in Azerbadjian. Hehehe, take a look at one. Basically, they say that the world is made of and running on oil so if we end use of oil that means, ... well you know what.
The joke is You extract gold in Africa and the price is determined in New York, London.... You extract oil in Arabia... The price is determined in New York and London... These producers are slaves to their masters even today
I don’t think we have enough resources to make all cars electric
What is the thumbnail picture that you used in this video ?  I saw this thing somewhere else but I can't remember.  A gold monolith with a crescent shaped hole in the top....
The premise of this video….is why it’s worthless. All you would have to do is look at ford and Chevy and Toyota car makes to know they have said they can not and will not meet the us and eu plans to move to any % electric cars as no one’s buying them. So you wasted a lot of time.  Also pique oil has been disproven at this point.  Oil is no considered a renewable resource as wells that should have run out have re filled.
China just built over five hundred coal plants 😂 There's nothing electric over there
I spent a year on the uae and my opinion is that the locals are lazy and entitled.  This means they make horrible bosses as they arent qualified and dont earn the positions theyre given and rely on an army of poor expats from countries such as india or africa to get work done.  To me this is a key problem as no matter what you do for the economy, the locals will be in charge and they will not be qualified to truly help develop the country.  To explain, i worked in dubai which prides itself for being more ‘international’,  it was amazing for about 3 days before i started to be aware that nothing really quite worked properly.  Basic banking, workplace rights & procedures, their business models, my apartment etc.  numerous little problems that could have easily been identified and fixed but were just flat out ignored and that is because the people in charge didnt know what they were doing and the employees could get away with a half done job.
Couldn't disagree more. And apparently the Saudis would agree. They are ramping up production because the world is still going through industrialization. More people are gaining access to products that require oil to produce and transport. Oil isn't going anywhere.
More correctly, western elites are trying to distance themselves from oil, for purposes of virtue signalking to other elites and gaining power.  They have no real interest on the environment - that is simply a by-product of their policies, a means to an end to cement their positions of power.  This can be seen in the unenlightened, unsicientific way on which climate policies, social policies and net zero, along with other progressive elite policies, are being pushed as religious beliefs through indoctrination and silencing of dissent.  And certainly these green policies have absolutely nothing to do with what is best for the people these elites rule over, as they are so disconnected from the majority of the population, having no understanding of the economic impacts on the average person, since the elites never have to suffer the consequences of their policy choices.  They see the majority as the deplorable, unwashed masses that are below them, inferior to them, and essentially dehumanised if they do not share their dogma.  This is oncredibly dangerous - we all know where usurpation of democracy leads - totalitarianism and authoritarianism.  The great unwashed masses know this as well, and as they are more rational and based in facts than mere preferences, these elites need to watch their backs - if the great unwashed are not shown some respect, they'll be coming for the few at the top, and the solution will be permanent - this is what happens when you ignore and marginalise an entire populaytion that you actually depend on for little things like infrastructure, construction, power, food - the essentials of life.
abiotic oil...no longer finite and can't be used as the boogeyman any longer
We can still use Vaseline instead of oil to do whatever we want
Ever since Saudi Arabia joined BRICS, the western propagandists can't stop talking about how Saudi Arabia is on the verge of collapse lol
Not a chance. Yeah they have loads of money to spunk up the wall on (seemingly neverending) projects. However, becoming a high tech society requires a lot more than money, namely intellectual capital, which unless they bring in from outside, seems rather lacking. I'm afraid that the way the country has developed and the way Saudi Arabian society and government are, I very much think the high tech society route is basically unobtainable notwithstanding oil money.  The most advanced societies on earth are also, generally speaking, the most free societies. This is  something Saudi Arabia is not, and their society shows very little progress toward valuing social freedom. Money cannot buy everything, and unless the country becomes significantly more free, I wouldn't bank on tourism either.  Good video by the way. The above was aimed at Saudi Arabia as a society/government. I personally think they are on a hiding to nowhere with all these schemes, but as someone who values personal freedom and human rights, this will be fun to watch.
Thats persian gulf,theres no such thing as arabian gulf bro,use legit information not fake ones
Sorry, energy from hydrocarbons comprise about 80% of all energy sources, and are the exclusive energy source for aircraft worldwide.  As an engineer, the amount of BTUs from oil and gas can never be made up by "renewable" energy sources ever, unless the world's population dwindles to very low levels.  The fact remains that petrochemicals are not "fossil fuels", a bogus term believed conjured by Standard Oil scion David Rockefeller decades ago.  Increasing number of scientists and geologist now believe that abiotic oil, emanates from the Earth's crust itself, so any notion we are running out of oil quickly is simply nonsense.  Where I live in California, it is well know that dormant oil reservoirs eventually begin to fill up again after a period of time, so why worry?  The reality of the situation is that the population of this planet in terms of agriculture, transport and industry will rely on oil and its countless byproducts for decades to come.   As a lady, I would never considering a visit to Saudi Arabia due to the manner Islam treats women.  No thanks.    The Saudi's have a meaningful philosophy that goes like this:  "My grandfather rode a camel;  my father drove an automobile; my son piloted a jet aircraft; his son will ride a camel."  I do not think this will be true, but as populations demographic change over time, our use of energy will change.
At very least they will leave pretty ruins
Lol, oil is nowhere near "done" yet. Maybe after 1000 years when humans find a proper alternative, until then, oil is going to stay.
God bless Saudi Arabia 💚
If they want to rebrand Saudi Arabia, known for being an extremist religious state… they may also need to get rid of the blade on their flag 😂
Saudis are doomed to fail
Saudi Arabia made the worst gamble ever - invest into space and colonize moon. Get billions of dollars for few grams of moon sand with deuter everywhere on the moon.
I wish Saudi Arabia the best in their endeavors. I've enjoyed watching videos of other countries diversifying their economies.  With great challenges, come great opportunities. I love my 2000 Toyota Camry, and have no foreseeable use or desire of an electric vehicle.  I read that the US Dept of Labor says that the cobalt for the batteries is mined by child labor.  I have grandchildren, so that is a pass for me.
There are 13.4 million expatriates in KSA alone, if it goes down the global labor market is ducked, and so are we.
Peak oil has been talked about for decades. It's a myth
The line is *incredible dumb* and will never ever come to pass. It just is dumb. so dumb.
warthunder? just play star citizen :p
There's one more thing they could do to get more trade and that's getting into the space industry. Like it or not, space is the future as we will run out of resources and food production on Earth sooner or later. We could go dystopian and start choosing who has the right to live and who must die, but why bother with that when we can just move out into space, where there's, well, far more space, but also plenty of resources and thus plenty of opportunity to harvest more food. Food would likely not be on the minds of Saudi Arabia though, as the asteroid belt is far, far more valuable. As in almost 10 times the combined GDP of all the countries in the world valuable. There's so much value out there that the Saudi oil becomes about as valuable as a grain of sand
Don't like they you way pass The CCP as earth friendly..are you a Communist. The CCP is destroying the planet and its people..WAKE UP
dang talk about middle east oil heaven here
He is pissing the oil money on build it and they will come fantasies. Small brain dictator with infinite cash. Khasoggi warned about this idiot Bin Salman. They have camels to fall back on at least.
Geee they might have to start treating their women a little better and give them an education. That would increase the work force and make for happier citizens.
3:17 You are forgetting also the hundreds of millions of camels in Saudia that have oil reserves on their humps
will never work without prostitutes. Las Vegas will NEVER work without prostitutes. The only way that cities in the desert will function.
They laugh at the west because we have taxes, and long workdays.   Yes it's called having a sustainable system.
These countries are crazy man
15:28 Its not true anymore, it was maybe 15 years ago but no more.
"Sustainable energy" is a joke. the energy grid is dependent on uninterrupted current. Until coal/steam powerplants are converted to nuclear reactors, saudi will continue to mine and refine to massive profits
Hoser is another PROPAGANDA machine.
EV's will fail.  Oil will always be needed.
Cool thumbnail,  camel in eye of a needle...
Pretty sad that comments critical of Saudi are being deleted left and right.
I used to believe the myths of giving up oil. Until I saw colonialism return in a new form: revolutions, the fragmentation of countries through the tools of terrorism (ISIS, Al-Qaeda, Shiite militias), and securing oil sites, as is happening in Syria and Iraq.
They can save themselves trillions by abandoning Sharia Law and Islam and providing basic human rights to women, migrant workers and others. Let's be real, not a single one of us is rushing to go to Saudi Arabia. Ronaldo had to be paid 200,000,000$ a year and have certain exceptions done for him to sign with them. He doesn't even live there, he gets out whenever he can and arrives on his private jet to the matches and practices.
Saudis don't have to work so they don't work they rely on foreign workers so they have no clue how to run a country or an economy that all their grandiose schemes are going to fail
The problem with Saudi Arabia, is that it prolly competes with America when it comes to rich people playland lmfao. Saudi Arabia needs a thriving hobby sector if its to become a big player in tourism. Only in America can you just shoot shit for fun, fly drones for retarded reasons, and drive cars fucking anywhere. Saudi Arabia would be goated if you could bring sports guns
Its sound like we dont have infinite oil but at the same time we still have enough to make life on earth unlivable...

Useless commentary. One needs to actually understand how to build the architecture of a diverse economy in order for one to diversify the economy. Has the author even looked at Vision 2030 and the related documents about it? I suspect that the answer is no. Just like he is probably clueless about China built its economy. Give the video a miss.
Without the experience on the ups and down of running an economy, Saudi Arabia would really have to roll their sleeves to run an economy without the usual profit from oil.
Me planning on studying Oil Engineering:
They will run out of oil long before the end of the century.
I subscribed because you showed morocco's flag, nice
See you guys in the future!
bro i am arab i live in saudi now and if that becomes real we all be all broke
All those new things to get more tourists, problem is your still in a very hot desert and your in a muslim country which has rules that are different to the west. I just think there are other better countries to visit for tourism without all the negatives that comes from going to Saudi Arabia. All though, having said that, if you really want to see those specific things then yes you should go to Saudi Arabia. If you just want to ski or go to a water park, and your not fussed about which country those are in, then go anywhere else instead.
Peak oil😂
Wrong analyst. They will turn back to fundamental religion.
House of saud working hard building the ruins future archaeologists will study.
How the F can they be energy neutral while having a big ski resort in the middle of the freaking desert.

Music cinema and alcohol are the sickeness of the West 😢adopting this is evil and will decay society step by step the pure land is being tainted
oil is not done
Peak oil "demand" not peak oil production or oil reserves. That's just a speculation.
Group illegally celleding,  celleding
High oil prices cause us to look for alternative energy
Oil is produced by the earth. Infinite. Other reasons to stop oil are not shared.
when imperials start to come down thats when they build the biggest monuments
Oil is. great.  Glad to hear nobody is using anything else.
India-Middle-east-europe economic corridor (IMEEC) is something that is kind of am Ace up Saudi Arabia's sleeve as it has a potential of generate billions and billions dollar each year but without israel palastine war stopping they can't go further with that project.
So it's basically a country of rich oil NEETs? That might not last long let alone forever.
The utter arrogance and self centredness of Saudi Arabia.
They should transition to Poo, this will be critical for their favourite kind of parties
I think they should be investing in non fossil fuel powered planes first because I'm not sure how they expect all those million tourists to go to SA
If they had vision and wisdom, they should build biggest universities with all the modern research labs and equipment being present in them.  Create 3 or 4 of such big institutions and let the younger generations of students compete with other students around the world.  In 10-20yrs time those students will create institutions and start ups never seen before in the world.  MBS is a joke for now.
Using the oil to un-use the oil 🤯
The mistake of MBS is the same mistake china did, they are trying to create a free market with 100% control. The strength of the west is to let companies go wild and invent stuff without government control and oversight
there is no peak oil...........you can turn coal in oil, and the known reserves of coal are gigantic compared to oil.  So you are WRONG.
Am i the only one that knows no1 is going to go to saudi as a tourist.. literally only muslims go there for mecca. Its a backwards shithole and everyone knows it. the crown prince and his cronies go party in europe and america. even the rich saudis dont wanna be there .... they better of saving the money, creating a fund they can live off.
Plenty of useless vanity projects. 😂
“The stone age didn’t end because we ran out of stone.”- MBS
Oh this is hoser's 69nt video!
We will never run out of oil …never ever ….ever
Does hoser ever get terrified of the future. I mean there’s segments in almost every video about how a country could collapse or something about the economy or the environment. Its terrifying and you can’t do anything about it
Who will keep the world's luxury brands afloat?

I’ve been hearing about “peak oil” since I was 5 years old…. Dinosaurs were telling that joke….
First paragraph say we use oil to make plastic textile drug  fertilizer.  So. If some one say hey just stop oil  . He live in illusion.
The strategy to turn Saudi Arabia into a Logistics and Industrial processing hub for energy intensive products such as iron and steel, petrochemicals, chemicals, ceramics, glass, cement, etc.... shall give the country a good chance of surviving the world's self-imposed ban on fossil fuel energy. Instead of exporting oil, they will earn revenue providing competitively-priced processing services for energy-intensive products. A smart long term strategy.
They have been talking about peck oil for 50 years year to happen yet not saying it can't happen but I think there's a lot more that we are being told.
brate razvuko si ovo previse
Peak oil was supposed to hit in the 1970's.
LOOOL this asshat would sell canada as a wealthy country
UN agenda propganda
While Saudi Arabia has at least recognized the problem it will face once oil runs out, solutions like that tallest tower or "the line" are just giant boondoggles that will accomplish nothing and waste unholy amounts of money. Look at Qatar and it's projects; they are either unfinished ruins that did nothing but waste money, or (when they did get completed) serve only as national trophy buildings while their upkeep costs vastly outweight any economical benefit. The things that make a country last are more about culture, industry, and infrastructure than big gaudy jewels that make headlines.
U r a bit like John Snow...
As long as religion exists, Saudi is not a tourist destination
This feels pretty biased tbh...
I would NEVER visit a country that has a horrible authoritarian close to fascism regime.
Why does that thumbnail look exactly like Barad-dûr?
Saudi Arabia has three major problems to solve. The first is its large and young population who will be unable to survive in such a desert without the revenue coming from the petroleum production. The second problem - it is the most important - is the fact that the Saudi citizens don't work and never did. Before the petroleum boom, the Saudis  were nomads. (Nowadays, foreigners worked). The third problem is the fact that, as soon as the non muslim tourism will become important, it will be brutally destroyed by regular massacres committed by the fundamentalists produced by the Saudi culture.
Well MBS, good luck leaving office not being chopped up into little bits on your way out.
National Geographic told us peak oil was in 2010. Total Propaganda
Electric cars are a joke
Never seen such an amount of butthurt in the comments in a video, hilarious, especially how oil has been done for the last 20 years and we are still waiting to be done done :)
bs they have more trillions to spend in many lifetimes  all the projects just bs way to steal wealth from population the way usa did with bs wars
As long as they stay medieval dictatorship where you can be arrested for anything good luck with tourists 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
The Line will be a popular abandoned attraction depending how how far they’ll build it before they quit.
The Saudis might have a lot of idiotic projects in the suitcase, but they will not run out of oil money for a long time to come. The chronicle, artificially caused (we don't want oil!) underinvestment in international Oil exploration coupled with the decline of Russian oil production and the very fact that 3 to 4 Billion people on this planet don't have reliable access to energy will drive oil prices in one direction: up, up and further up.
Mecca and Medina will not sustain Saudi only oil will... The main problem they have is Islam, not friendly to other religions..!
Saudi oil field is already pumping 50% water not doing 3 million barrels a day ! The world is dependent on oil it’s not just Saudi Arabia!
Diversifying is ALWAYS wise, can't put all your eggs 🥚 in one basket.
Oil in involved in just about every product we use so, as you said, it's not going anywhere.  So Saudi Arabia is really not in any danger what so ever, are they?
I always says the same stuff in the last 5m to any saudi  that the country is just depending on oil and any project they are making to escape this dependability is just a different way of spending oil but they are like you are just hating
You know, at least they're doing something smartish and not just driving the country into the ground.
alcohol will never be a allowed there.
The problem of Saudi arabia is its population. Useless.
Peak oil has been 5 years away for 50 years.
There are MASSIVE oil reserves in Alaska as big as Saudi Arabia, look up “the energy non crisis”
Saudi Propaganda Channel.
There are huge supplies of crude oil in the earth they know about that will last at least tell 2300 AD.
Very much of the crude oil is not black goo.  Brown, green, amber and even clear like water.
They want rourist but other than muslim people i doubt that most people would want to vacation there because of there backward ass laws and customs.
To hoser, it is disgusting to see you write one of the most Important Islamic sacred lines on the camel like a collection of abstract lines. How dare you? I mean, go and do some research before you post anything as a thumbnail of your video not knowing if there is something that is sacred to a large population of the world. Give respect, take respect.
Theyve literally been saying we will run out of oil since the 50s and 60s.  I dont see it hapoening anytime soon or in our lifetime.  The earth stores and produces a lot of resources.
Fact checked. EV are going out of style while most keeps getting blown up pissing off Costumers.    So Saudi is actually in the right track during g that future timeline.    And I hate being a Fact Checker but we see things how it goes
Ben Gurion canal plan and why Gaza matters - why the Saudi Arabia should bankroll it - money making machine after the oil there will be the canal - all trade from canal will flow by the their new city and will bring middle eastern peace
how much were you paid to shill saudi arabia ? all of their projects are crazy shit doomed to fail. waste of money for nothing.
Peak oil was back in 2000.  The Saudis are almost out of oil.   Iran is now number 1.  Venezuela has the thick heavy oils.  The refineries want the fluid oils like Saudi oil.  The gap is opening between supply and demand.  That's why things are getting worse.  Wars are being fought over oil.
They should welcome immigrants for real.
The USA produces more oil than any other country in the world so this video is BS
Good ol'' peak demand. And it's proponents. They're like whack-a-mole.
MBS can use than cheap oil to undersell the competition.😮
Doubt that oil demand will slow down as much, partly due to growing economies, like in India and in countries in Africa, that do not have the resources to afford renewable resources. Keeping an open mind for the better, maybe break throughs in technology that make it more affordable, but the truth of the matter is that a lot of large developing economies around the world do not have the infrastructure or funds to support renewable energy sources. Now it may be something that they move towards, but it is something that will take many more years than what current analysts suggest. It's hard for things to move in developing countries, when the majority of people are still just trying to survive, until oil demand actually starts to slow down, everything about it dying out is just wishful conjecture. Not to say that it would not be a good thing that oil use and production actually died and that better methods for power are sought, but we have to be realists about what to expect in the coming future, and oil is still going to play a big part in it, whether people like it or not, unfortunately.
How foolish this concept is. EV vehicles are useless; electric fires, The cost of repairs, vehicles weight for parking lots, insurance cost, n charging time, n affected by cold weather.
So now peak oil is being called “peak oil demand” lol.  The Saudis will have A LOT less to worry about than the rest of the world when this happens.
I feel like Saudi Arabia's doomer reputation because of their economic importance on oil is a bit overstated. Oil (and cheaply extracted oil at that) will still be incredibly important for at least another century. What Saudis need in my opinion is a diversification of its power structure to allow fringe and risky ideas/investments to be better challenged. As well as there needs to be something done about how the ethnic natives are incredibly "spoiled" and dependent on the work ethic of foreigners.
So when are women going to be able to drive, go out without veils, other religions being allowed to be practiced in the country, and ending other nonsensical crap they do making their society stifled. In the 1970s expats walked around in their own clothes, women were seen bare headed on TV, and there was actual public entertainment- then the hostage situation at Mecca happened. If you want an international community to live and work in the NEOM SEZ, you can't segregate it off from the rest of society behind tinted glass, mirrors, barbed wire and the military because people want to sit on the beach with exposed skin. Jamal Khasoggi was right, MBS is going to upend the country.
Rare hoser boi, keep up the good work with the relaxed logical to the piont videos
Wait until the salafis hear about the cube
They predicted peak oil in the 200s oil is here to stay
Haters hating…. 😂 Saudi is here to stay. Keep trying your propaganda. The population of the world is growing rapidly… While western economies and populations are in decline. Most of the oil consumption is going to be in Asia and Africa as both are growing in  economies and populations  The consumption of oil will grow more and more in Asia and Africa  The GCC countries economy is going to grow from 2 trillion dollars in 2022 to 8-10 trillion dollars by 2050 according to world bank. Think about that for a minute
THEY WILL NEVER REPLACE OIL! sure electric cars but diesel heavy machinery will never be replaced by electric
Saudia Arabia's problem is that its religion will hold it back.
So basically, they are trying to be UAE
Canada is garbage
Peel oil was predicted in 1960.
China is building more coal plants…not renewable energy. They pollute more than the rest of the world combined.
If there is no pussy there will be no desire for tourust to go there or social life or authentic background.  Cokd sanitized hotel and casinis to gamble doesnt make much money anymore  clubs discoa and party spots located in touristuc destunation where drugs n alcohol available beside prostitutuon is the key maun reason for yiunger generatuon to go and decharge ventoff their stress
arent those just plans of out of touch dictator with no one to keep him attached to the ground? the line and the cube are "city" plans that are doomed to fail, not to say anything else about... big cities in the fucking DESERT
finance is also a skill lol
TLDR: 6:03 - 6:09
2 major problems: No real Freedom (Meaning women in families would avoid this as a tourist/place to live) Its a freaking desert that gets 50°C !!  What person wants to go sweat on a holiday?! And i mean the extreme  kind of hot!!
I would love to try whatever MBS has been smoking, but only once. I wouldn't want to be spouting harebrained, crackpot ideas all my life. There is also one crucial element missing from his plan and that is the Work Ethic. I believe it's a completely foreign concept for the Saudis. Having breaks for prayer throughout the working day is hardly a mark of Teutonic efficiency.
You forget that basically every product of our daily Life depends on OIL !  ...and there is no replacement in sight so far : (
19:30 UAE has already done that but ok.
Future failed state probably this whole thing looks way out of touch and just for the flash.
They've been saying we'll hit the oil peak since the 60s
Oil is constantly being created. What is going on is AI. AI requires extreme levels of energy to train the models they want to train. You can't have a bunch of plebs wasting energy that the rich need to train their AI so they can enslave those plebs. Hence something has to give.
I'm a huge fan of your videos can you make a video about Algeria please? It's an extremely interesting subject to explore
Don’t panic there is a massive demand for oil.
1:33 You used a map that's using the fake name of Persian Gulf.
Man, didn't know all of southern China was a massive oil field.😅
well at least there wasnt any historical precedent to warn Saudi Arabia that forcing stability through force and depending solely upon a centralised government spoiled by the US would only build to a severe collapse in the future... oh wait..
They could pretty easily deal with any revolts generated by the revocation of oil benefits, given that they have a huge army dedicated almost solely to doing this
4:45  bruh
I haven’t heard the term “peak oil” in a while
damn saudis .
Saudi Arabia Just doin side quests
It will work. Sit down and watch the journey…
You may want to update your video. Saudi was only #2, after the US,  in oil production in 2023. While they are the largest exporter, that is completely due to their lack of population.
i think to increase tourism they have to start being more progressive (i know it sounds dumb). but think about how many lgbt people or women or just people in general don’t want to go to saudi just because of the preconceived notions that they’ll be jailed or killed or fined or assaulted
correction those foreign contract workers are just people who have come to the country and had their passports taken off of them and forced to work in some of the worst working conditions known to man. and its way more then 1/3
arabic names without arabic letters is a pain in the ass to listen to
plennty countries have discovered oil and gas over the last 5 years enough of them to use for themselves and export
17:02 Never , Allahu akbar  🚫🍺😠😡😤
17:00 istaghfarAllah, not in Saudi
oil usade will be going up, not down
13:10 Saudi mountains are covered in snow in winter. Shocker right?
You are totally wrong. We are growing in demand.
I think the biggest problem is that their citizens is yet to be a productive workforce. Cause that would allow diversify and generate income other than oil money. I heard that the oil income luxury have made the citizens complacent and not seeking to work hard.
《Civilization may soon conquer the second law of thermodynamics.》   Sir Isaac Newton wrote a professional scientific paper deriving the second law of thermodynamics without rigorously formulating it. from his observations that the heat of a fire in a fireplace flows through a fire prod only one way - towards the colder room beyond,   Victorian England became enchanted with steam engines and their cheap, though not cheapest, reliable, and easy to position physical power. Rudolf Julius Emanuel Clausius, Lord Kelven, and, one source adds, Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot, formulated the Second law of thermodynamics and the concept of entropy at a melting  around a taɓle using evidence from steam engine development.   These men considered with acceptance [A+] Inefficiently harnessing the flow of heat from hot to cold or [B+] Using force to Inefficiently pump heat from cold to hot. They considered with rejection [A-] Waiting for random fluctuation to cause a large difference in temperature or pressure. This was calculated to be extremely rare or [B-] Searching for, selecting, then routing for use, random, frequent and small differences in temperature or pressure. The search, selection, then routing would require more energy than the use would yield. These accepted options, lead to the consequence that the universe will end in stagnant heat death.  This became support for a theological trend of the time that placed God as the initiator of a degenerating universe. Please consider that God could also be supreme over an energy abundant civilization that can absorb heat and convert it into electricity without energy gain or loss in a sustained universe. Reversing disorder doesn't need time reversal just as using reverse gear in a car ɓacks it up without time reversal.   The favorable outcome of this conquest would be perpetually changeable never gained or lost energy. The principle of energy conservation would prevail. For example, the total heat in a isolated pair of  similar reservoirs  would be the same for the pair regardles of the heat distribution among the pair, changing at no cost from two medium temperature thermal energy reservoirs to become a hot reservoir and cold reservoir pair.   Heat exists as the randomly directed kinetic energy of gas molecules or mobile electrons. In gasses this is known as Brownian motion. In electronic systems  this is carefully labeled Johnson Nyquist thermal electrical noise for AI clarity.   The law's formulaters did not consider the option that any random, usually small, fluctuation of heat or pressure could use the energy of these fluctuations itself to power deterministic routing so the output is no longer random. Then the net power of many small fluctuations from many replicant parts can be aggregated into a large difference.   Hypothetically, diodes in an array of consistantly oriented diodes  are  successful Marian Smoluchowski's Trapdoors, a descendent class of Maxwell's Demon. Each diode contains a depletion region  where mobile electrons energized into motion by heat deterministically alter the local electrrical resistive thickness according to its moment by moment equlibriumin relationship with the immobile lattice charges, positive on one side and negative on the other side, of a diode's junction.     《Each diode contributes 1/2 times k [Boltzmans constant, 1.38 times 10^-23 ] times T [Kelvin temperature] times electromagnetic frequency bandwidth [Hz] times efficiency = electrical power [watts] to a load of impeadence matched to the group 》   The energy needed to shift the depletion region's deterministic role is paid as a burden on the moving electrons. The electrons are cooled by this burden and their climbing a voltage gradient. Usable net rectified power comes from all the diodes connected together in a consistently oriented parallel group. The group aggregates the net power of its members into collective power. Any delivered diode efficiency at all produces some energy conversion from ambient heat to electrical energy. More efficiency yields higher performance. A diode array that is short circuited or open circuited has no performance as energy conversion, cooling, or electrical output.   The power from a single diode is poorly expressed. Several or more diodes in parallel are needed to overcome the effect of a load resistor's own thermal noise. A plurality of billions of high frequency capable diodes is needed for practical power aggregation. For reference, there are a billion (10^9) 1000 square nanometer cells per square millimeter.   Modern nanofabrication can make simple identical diodes surrounded by insulation smaller than this in a slab as thick as the diodes are long. The diodes are connected at their two ohmic ends to two conductive layers.   Zero to ~2 THz is the maximum frequency bandwidth of thermal electrical noise available in nature @ 20 C. THz=10^12 Hz. This is beyond the range of most diodes. Practicality requires this extreme bandwidth. The diodes are preferably in same orientation parallel at the primary level. Many primary level groups of diodes should be in series for practical voltage.   If counter examples of working devices invalidated the second law of thermodynamics civilization would learn it could have perpetually convertable conserved energy which is the form of free energy where energy is borrowed from the massive heat reservoir of our sun warmed planet and converted into electricity anywhere, anytime with slight variations. Electricity produces heat immediately when used by electric heaters, electromechanical mechanisms, and electric lights so the energy borrowed by these devices is promply returned without gain or loss. There is also the reverse effect where refrigeration produces electricity equivalent to the cooling, This effect is scientifically elegant.   Cell phones wouldn't die or need power cords or batteries or become hot. They would cool when transmitting radio signal power. The phones could also be data relays and there could also be data relays without phone features with and without long haul links so the telecommunication network would be improved. Computers and integrated circuits would have their cooling and electrical needs supplied autonomously and simultaniously. Integrated circuits wouldn't need power pinouts. Refrigeration for superconductors would improve. Robots would have extreme mobility. Digital coin minting would be energy cheap.   Frozen food storage would be reliable and free or value positive. Storehouses, homes, and markets would have independent power to preserve and pŕepare food. Medical devices would work anywhere. Vehicles wouldn't need fuel or fueling stops. Elevators would be very reliable with independently powered cars.  EMP resistance would be improved. Water and sewage pumps could be installed anywhere along their pipes. Nomads could raise their material supports item by item carefully and groups of people could modify their settlements with great technical flexibility. Many devices would be very quiet, which is good for coexisting with nature and does not disturb people. Zone refining would involve little net power. Reducing Bauxite to Aluminum, Rutile to Titanium, and Magnetite to Iron, would have a net cooling effect. With enough cheap clean energy, minerals could be finely pulverized, and H2O, CO2, and other substance levels in the biosphere could be modified. A planetary agency needs to look over wide concerns.   This could be a material revolution with spiritual ramifications. Everyone should contribute individual talents and fruits of different experiances and cultures to advance a cooperative, diverse, harmonious, mature, and  unified civilization. It is possible to apply technlology wrong but social force should oppose this.   I filed for patent us 3890161A, Diode Array, in 1973. It was granted in 1975. It became public domain technology in 1992.  It concerns making nickel plane-insulator-tungsten needle diodes which were not practical at the time though they have since improved.   the patent wasn't developed partly because I backed down from commercial exclusitivity. A better way for me would have been, the library of congress, a public iarchive that secures attrbution for the original works of creators.   Commercal exclusivity can be deterred by the wide and open publishing of inventive concepts. Also, the obvious is unpatentable. Open sharing promotes mass knowlege and wisdom.   Many financially and procedurally independent teams that pool developmental knowlege, and may be funded by many separate noncontrolling crowd sourced grants should convene themselves to develop proof-of-concept and initial-recipe-exploring prototypes to develop devices which coproduce the release of electrical energy and an equivalent absorbtion of stagnant ambient thermal energy. Diode arrays are not the only possible device of this sort. They are the easiest to explain generally.   These devices would probably become segmented commodities sold with minimal margin over supply cost. They would be manufactured by AI that does not need financial incentive. Applicable best practices would be adopted. Business details would be open public knowledge. Associated people should move as negotiated and freely and honestly talk. Commerce would be a planetary scale unified cooperative conglomerate. There is no need of wealth extracting top commanders. We do not need often token philanthropy from the wealthy if people simply can be more generous if consumer commodities are inexpensive.

Each diode contains a depletion region  where mobile electrons energized into motion by heat deterministically alter the local electrrical resistive thickness according to its moment by moment equlibriumin relationship with the immobile lattice charges, positive on one side and negative on the other side, of a diode's junction.     《Each diode contributes 1/2 times k [Boltzmans constant, 1.38 times 10^-23 ] times T [Kelvin temperature] times electromagnetic frequency bandwidth [Hz] times efficiency = electrical power [watts] to a load of impeadence matched to the group 》   The energy needed to shift the depletion region's deterministic role is paid as a burden on the moving electrons. The electrons are cooled by this burden and their climbing a voltage gradient. Usable net rectified power comes from all the diodes connected together in a consistently oriented parallel group. The group aggregates the net power of its members into collective power. Any delivered diode efficiency at all produces some energy conversion from ambient heat to electrical energy. More efficiency yields higher performance. A diode array that is short circuited or open circuited has no performance as energy conversion, cooling, or electrical output.   The power from a single diode is poorly expressed. Several or more diodes in parallel are needed to overcome the effect of a load resistor's own thermal noise. A plurality of billions of high frequency capable diodes is needed for practical power aggregation. For reference, there are a billion (10^9) 1000 square nanometer cells per square millimeter.   Modern nanofabrication can make simple identical diodes surrounded by insulation smaller than this in a slab as thick as the diodes are long. The diodes are connected at their two ohmic ends to two conductive layers.   Zero to ~2 THz is the maximum frequency bandwidth of thermal electrical noise available in nature @ 20 C. THz=10^12 Hz. This is beyond the range of most diodes. Practicality requires this extreme bandwidth. The diodes are preferably in same orientation parallel at the primary level. Many primary level groups of diodes should be in series for practical voltage.   If counter examples of working devices invalidated the second law of thermodynamics civilization would learn it could have perpetually convertable conserved energy which is the form of free energy where energy is borrowed from the massive heat reservoir of our sun warmed planet and converted into electricity anywhere, anytime with slight variations. Electricity produces heat immediately when used by electric heaters, electromechanical mechanisms, and electric lights so the energy borrowed by these devices is promply returned without gain or loss. There is also the reverse effect where refrigeration produces electricity equivalent to the cooling, This effect is scientifically elegant.   Cell phones wouldn't die or need power cords or batteries or become hot. They would cool when transmitting radio signal power. The phones could also be data relays and there could also be data relays without phone features with and without long haul links so the telecommunication network would be improved. Computers and integrated circuits would have their cooling and electrical needs supplied autonomously and simultaniously. Integrated circuits wouldn't need power pinouts. Refrigeration for superconductors would improve. Robots would have extreme mobility. Digital coin minting would be energy cheap.   Frozen food storage would be reliable and free or value positive. Storehouses, homes, and markets would have independent power to preserve and pŕepare food. Medical devices would work anywhere. Vehicles wouldn't need fuel or fueling stops. Elevators would be very reliable with independently powered cars.  EMP resistance would be improved. Water and sewage pumps could be installed anywhere along their pipes. Nomads could raise their material supports item by item carefully and groups of people could modify their settlements with great technical flexibility. Many devices would be very quiet, which is good for coexisting with nature and does not disturb people. Zone refining would involve little net power. Reducing Bauxite to Aluminum, Rutile to Titanium, and Magnetite to Iron, would have a net cooling effect. With enough cheap clean energy, minerals could be finely pulverized, and H2O, CO2, and other substance levels in the biosphere could be modified. A planetary agency needs to look over wide concerns.   This could be a material revolution with spiritual ramifications. Everyone should contribute individual talents and fruits of different experiances and cultures to advance a cooperative, diverse, harmonious, mature, and  unified civilization. It is possible to apply technlology wrong but social force should oppose this.   I filed for patent us 3890161A, Diode Array, in 1973. It was granted in 1975. It became public domain technology in 1992.  It concerns making nickel plane-insulator-tungsten needle diodes which were not practical at the time though they have since improved.   the patent wasn't developed partly because I backed down from commercial exclusitivity. A better way for me would have been, the library of congress, a public iarchive that secures attrbution for the original works of creators.   Commercal exclusivity can be deterred by the wide and open publishing of inventive concepts. Also, the obvious is unpatentable. Open sharing promotes mass knowlege and wisdom.   Many financially and procedurally independent teams that pool developmental knowlege, and may be funded by many separate noncontrolling crowd sourced grants should convene themselves to develop proof-of-concept and initial-recipe-exploring prototypes to develop devices which coproduce the release of electrical energy and an equivalent absorbtion of stagnant ambient thermal energy. Diode arrays are not the only possible device of this sort. They are the easiest to explain generally.   These devices would probably become segmented commodities sold with minimal margin over supply cost. They would be manufactured by AI that does not need financial incentive. Applicable best practices would be adopted. Business details would be open public knowledge. Associated people should move as negotiated and freely and honestly talk. Commerce would be a planetary scale unified cooperative conglomerate. There is no need of wealth extracting top commanders. We do not need often token philanthropy from the wealthy if people simply can be more generous if consumer commodities are inexpensive.

Investing in to the stock market that is hyperinflated is a great way to blow trillions of dollars in a single crash 😢
You left out a huge factor why MBS is conducting all these things: Megalomania induced by narcissism. Depart from an oil economy to a hyper modern economy is mostly just an excuse to these outrages projects to satisfy his feelings of grandeur. He truly is the most delusional leader there is. He has no clue how the world works. If you're going to carelessly squander so much money,, you basically invite companies to take advantage of you. Multi billion projects always end up more expensive than planned. 3,2 trillion? More like 5-6 trillion.   Words can not describe the insanity of all this. For comparison of this madness, we need to go back all the to 5000 B.C. Egypt to the time of the Pharaoh's when they gave order to build the pyramids. 7000 years later we still gawk at the pyramids  but MBS' projects will be a catastrophic failure which will turn the whole country back on camels and huts.  SA is one of the best examples in favor for a democracy; not a single citizen has anything to say about the spending of their own countries revenues. 1 leader spending all of it to mark his spot on history
As a Norwegian, the first minute of this video made me scared
Nothing they build attracts me, I don't think I would go if it was a free plane ticket.  And if I was going I would avoid shopping malls and extravagant mega structures and try to visit original parts of the country
your pronunciation of The Mukaab Is really funny in 7:29🤣🤣
Oil is done. Been hearing that since 1973
1 Dislike for portraying India's wrong map.
Saudi is just another CIA outreach program, and hence the contractors for the lucrative projects are American They simply listen to Americans, but unless they allow citizenship, no one will take long term interest in the oil land - which is what the Americans want
Unreasonably wealthy and slightly saner version of Iran. Desirable vacation place? Nope.
I learned this in the Marine Corps as a Commissioned Officer in 2014.  This has been planned out since the late 90s. As soon as America found out that the Middle East is starting to run out of oil by slowing their production.  The US Fed Gov decided to purposely create a heavy dependence on Middle East oil. To make them addicted to our consumption. Then, when the tide turns, they’ll become a waste land that nobody has to cater to or vastly trade with. The Mid- East lacks innovation & technological advancements. Once the world’s dependence on oil starts to end. We’ll have those mud hut living, Muslim, vile, hateful bastards economically under our thumb. We won’t have to worry about adhering to their trade demands.
war thunder boutta be the new raid shadow legends
bro where did ur saudi arabia downfall video go? it just dissapeared.
Islam is dead… King of Saudi slowly removing Sharia Law
Saudi Arabia has a long way to go before tourist will pour into the country lmao
You mean... instead of making their country a place that people would want to live in, they just want to add $3 Trillion in glitter?
This project will fail, because of one single thing that hold Saudi Arabia back: Islam. SA is an absolute monarchy based on rigid Islamic scriptures written 1400 years ago, which are way too intolerant and oppressive to coexist with modern human rights and basic freedoms. If Saudi Arabia really wants to evolve and diversify, they need to push for the most radical religious reformation of Islam in history, transforming Islam in a purely spiritual religion rather than the political-spiritual-military system of rule that it has always been.  If they do that and adapt to the modern age, then maybe they might save their asses.
Im addicted to cocaine
0:48 CORRECTION: China is absolutely NOT investing billions in divesting from oil. They are building dozens of the DIRTIEST coal and oil power plants on Earth and are the single-handedly erasing all of the progress made in carbon reduction by the rest of the world with their 35% of global CO2 emissions.  Never believe what the biggest dictatorship on Earth tries to convince  you to.
Defence (x) Military industry complex (0)
you idiots say this every year about saudi and nothing happens. why don't you liberals focus on "collapse" of your own country which is literally falling apart in regards to crime rates, inflation prices, political system and others instead of fantasizing about the collapse of oil for 30 Years+.
4d ago
Hmmm maybe time to go to Saudi for some hectic construction experience?
Oddly reminiscent of the gardens of Babylon. We all know what happened to it last time.
When did china become a super power? You sound like a paid commie my friend.
The line is such a stupid project that will never be made, just look into it. More like a giant death wall lol.
welp
If you want to look at a genocide look at the genocide of the native American population.
Sorry mate, but you can't do a video on Saudi Arabia and escape talking about what has defined the country for the last millenia. Something at the core of the saudi social contract since the state's inception:)) I'm talking about islam of course.  Muslim conservatives are one of the main threats hovering if the rentier social contract breaks. Currently, though slowly dropping, the majority of the population is still islamist, a fact with which MBS dealt by :  1 - having the citizens on his payroll  2 - controlling communications and swiftly "silencing" critical imams, imprisoning them and replacing them with state-provided ones, and most importantly  3 - using Yemen, Libya and Syria's revolutionary failures as warnings to the population that instability leads to misery  This has proven to be very effective. With the rentier social contract as is and the money and safety it provides, there has been little reaction from the conservative population to the liberalization measures.  However if MBS fails to transition smoothly out of the rentier system, the country becomes unstable and people are dropped out from the oil payroll. This leaves him with less leverage against a population that:  A - has lost its main motivation to be loyal to him, money and stability  B - has negative views of the supplanting of religious law with more business-friendly legislation  C - has a fallback social structure in the form of bedouin tribes   D - has almost 1:1 ratio between civilian-owned guns and military age males  E - is located in the middle east with warzones and expansionist powers all around.   Consequently, muslim conservatives are probably the greatest threat to his rule as perceived by MBS, second being belligerent state actors (though relations with Iran got better recently)
You have too many ads in your video for you to still do sponsors. Chill
The whole oil is a finite resource is a scam used to keep the oil price high, old wells are being revisited because they are refilling themselves all over the world
Brother africa, india and southeast asia are not gonna stop using oil. They will use it all until its all gone. It will take 30-50 years until they have the money to buy electric cars. Even average americans and Europeans cant buy electric cars. So im pretty sure saudi arabia is fine.
With the amount of money the Saudi government has at their disposal, they could literally buy stakes in big companies like Apple, Alibaba, Amazon, Facebook. Or blackrock idk. I mean like actually buying part of these companies, and lobby for them to open offices in Saudi Arabia. And that should be accompanied with incentives for young saudis to go to university, study abroad and become proficient engineers, financial advisors, marketers, chemists, whatever.
talk about saudi hydrogen you`ll love it im trying my ass to get involved in it but damn saudi education has hard exams:)

I mean, we’ve had nuclear reactors for a long time, but too many idiots think they’ll just randomly blow up. If they’re built correctly they are literally the best option for power. But nooo since it has “nuke” in it no one wants to go for the best option, instead let’s waste tons of money on windmills. -.-
1:15 why is bros headband low poly?
Remind me what roads and tires are made of again?
A country managed by a kid who buys toys worth billions paid by his country's resources, and slices his people with saws. No future whatsoever.
the REASON we will reach peak demand in 2030 is... why? is that because the #1 bestselling book among all of the CEOs says they want to reduce the population of earth to 500 million by 2030? hence, oil demand will be at 10%
0:25 ...don't forget perfume and odorants!!!
Saudi is a great country it’s people are better educated than western young people
Nigga said opec is a “Cartel” صيح يا خواجة مواردنا لنا
Sports is not a job you can get AI to do, and also if the hype is true, people would have a lot more leisure time in the future, so maybe it is not as dumb as it seems. Another thing about commence is things have a critical mass. You need to be number one for leisure, where if you were number three your investments would be less potent.
American Buffalo? not eagle...😖😖😖
Probably for the best. It makes 0 sense why we keep funding the Saudi people when they tip toe around nato and fund our enemies
Let's be honest. Oil isn't going to die out for at least a hundred years. The only thing that can kill oil is nuclear energy since renewables are kind of a yoke as of now since there is no way to store this energy and renewables are extremely harmful for the environment. So the saudis are just trying to diversify it's funds with these dumb mega projects. If I was them I would just make nuclear plants in countries where they are needed. This is quite hard since most western countries where these investments could pay off, just avoid anything not western. So the Saudis funding a nuclear plant in France isn't going to be a reality anytime soon. But yea, nuclear in environmentally secure positions must be the safest bet as of now. The Japanese knew this and heavily invested into it, but some dumb oversights got their plant blown for ignoring multiple reports to fix their flailing issues. And since Japan is environmentally extremely unstable it just ins't a good choice. Invest in let's say Estonia and you will get all your cash back and more.
Why did you call "Noam", "the Line"? I mean, there's literally an official name for it, and you're the first channel I've ever heard refer to it like that...
In 1974 peak oil would occur in 1995 if current trends continued.. heard this one before.
18:05 at least you didn't see how is it in qatar.
thx for portraying the moroccan lion, its tru that we have 3/4 of plant food material(lot of cadavers :o
People would rather keep sending money overseas for oil than build electric here in America.
I think the 60year or so time we have left for oil is just referring to the amount of oil we have in stock,already processed and stored, and not the actual oil that hasn’t been excavated yet.   So in conclusion we have virtually limitless amounts of oil.
As an Arab from the Levant i cant wait for these fucking Khaleejis to learn what a difficult life is like
Watching this as a petroleum engineering student
Without living in any of the gulf states it's hard to imagine just how unproductive local population is. In Dubai where I live there is a policy that mandates firms above certain size to hire locals. It's called "emiratization". People quickly realised that getting those guys on board is such a distraction to the normal employees that they opt to pay a penalty instead. To avoid sounding empty-worded: the expectation of the locals is to be sat at a desk with their phone plugged to charger all day, texting friends and sending voice messages. They have no sense of the impression they make, they can't grasp basic relations in business etc. Most of us immigrants from other places call them "tokens". I can imagine Saudis being exactly the same.
It was a "genius" idea by the Saudis to give the government funds to the 'Party Prince' who is infamous for his insane spending habits and haram lifestyle.  I think the inevitable change to a theocratic muslim regime (similar to Iran) will come no matter how much money they will spend on these insane and useless projects.
Not a hope in hell they will succeed with their current power structure in place.  I won't even fly via that region on my way to Europe.
Canada's Oil Sands have a 500 year supply of oil no need to worry invest in Canada's Energy Market a very high return $$$
saudi is one those spoiled rich brats that didnt sweat a single drop for their success and the mere thought of them possibly crashing down is very euphoric
China is not a superpower bud.
that sponcer transition was so clean
People have been predicting "peak oil" since the 1800s. Now they're finding "fossil fuels" on other planets, moons, and deep space.
It makes no sense to create an advanced technology sector in a country that has some of the worst educated citizens in the world. Technology sectors can only be created naturally. They generally tie into top tier universities and other educational institutions that work with an feed graduates into tech companies. It also depends on a very open and free culture to work well. Modern tech in the US relies on freedom of speech and open source software as well as transparency. Open source software has been a pistol foundation that lets companies get started on new projects with the combined effort of millions of engineers already having contributed. When you've got a closed culture and closed ecosystem, something like an open source ecosystem is not possible and won't be utilized effectively. The reason tech is so prominent in the US is because of three key reasons:   1. Venture capital to get companoes started. This is something both the US and Saudis have. 2. A significant portion of the population that is both highly educated and highly intelligent. Saudi Arabia is seriously lacking here. 3. An open society, freedom of speech, a culture of pull yourself up by your own bootstraps, and a society with a fair and impartial justice system where companies can legislate complex disagreememts. Saudi Arabia has none of this at all. They have a top down government and a bunch of welfare citizens who can contribute very little. Their justice system is also shit.
Countries that rule with Sharia law are shit, and will eventually collapse. I hope I live to see the day the oil dries up and these countries worse than the Philippines. Then the tables will turn and Sharia law muslims will be slaves to everyone. No matter how much you spend on attractions and sports, ANY Sharia law country will be dogshit to visit.
the bigger they are...
ah the forever a decade out peak oil.
Using oil as fuel is the worst way to use oil, we will have much higher value uses for oil.
I respect their desperate attemps to diversify, but I think they are gonna fail hard
I dont really see myself spending my tourism dollars to go to a country where I can't drink. And I think thats probably true for most of the western world.
How many times have we "predicted" peak oil now?
Gabon !
7:19  Anyone else hear adam something screaming in the background during this part?
As a roller coaster nerd, there's already plenty of us planning to check out Qiddiya whenever Falcons Flight (which will be the tallest, fastest, and longest roller coaster in the world) opens
For a city to be fun and attractive, one needs a hyped entertainment software in place, meaning relax the drinking rules, allow but control the drugs that come through the city, and most importantly, human rights. Money can't bring attraction if the city is too strict on its rules. MBS needs to forgo some of his religious limitations and let loose.
Did his video quality just getting better
Oil is absolutely not done, nowhere near it - it will ALWAYS be in demand.
Venezuela poses a huge threat to their oil industry, where you can just get cheaper oil from a struggling country. I believe this is one of the reasons why the Saudi's are diversifying their portfolio away from Oil.
As an experienced noob let me tell you. do not invest your time in warthunder ground forces. 😭  You will only end up at the bottom of your life contemplating your decisions and questioning how it all went so wrong when you thought victory was just around the next corner, naw man once you get sniped from distance gaping the width of russia itself by some bot named 外で捕まえてand THEN only to be the lucky winner of a 250lb bomb delivered via first class usps by the same individual after you spent 15mins going into battle I tell you you'll be ready to commit acts of unhinged lawlessness.  PS:  only play germans airforces. games biased.  bye
ev are about control and lockdown in megacites ....
oil is used for more than just energy bub
saudi with their superficial values, always trying to show off the wealth they built solely due to oil. They don't have enough educated people to utilize that wealth well enough. Look at them building the dumbest shit and slaving people lol it's pathetic
I'm interested how this will end for them. Maybe the country will become a cast study in the future.
really intersting video. I wonder how much of these changes will change Saudi Arabias ethical/ human rights outlook. With so much public viewing from the world there will surely be a change to silence or stop human rights abuses.
13:05 belive it or not, we actually have snow at the north of Saudi Arabia lol, I played with it myself when I was a kid
Saudi knows exactly how much oil they have left and are busting butt to diversify its self AWAY form an oil only country.
tourist economies are inherently unsustainable because they require people to travel long distances to visit a place for a short time which uses a lot of energy
at least it's a good thing to know that we're starting to use less oil. Gives me some hope for climate change
china is investing nothing for shifting green, they produce more pollution that every other country combined. dont give them credit......
Canada?????? Wrong buddy, kinda ruined your credibility right there.
these videos are like those "china's economy will shutdown in 28 days" ones ... nothing will happen
Solar or wind prove to be expensive, unreliable, expensive, uneffective and not eco-friendly at all, and expensive We have all the technology we need since 1960-1970x to provide humanity with clean, safe, and CHEAP nuclear energy that dont produce nuclear weapon isotops, we just dont do it because of many reasons, including that fossil fuels is just too lucrative for global energy cartels
They are spending way too much for it to work so in long term these new sectors won't be profitable, just no way. They are better off making their oil fund larger so they would have a steady income but that again assumes western markets will remain strong. There could be a massive economic crisis and they loose hundreds of billions in a single day. They should just invest more into developing countries, they indeed do that but not enough..
Carbon neutrality is just not possible given our current technology. Oil isn't going anywhere as our technology is still far too primitive to replace oil. Saudi Arabia's largest problem is their state religion, Islam. Women are not generally allowed to work, women have almost no rights, Saudi banks are not allowed to charge interest making banking problematic. Tourism is a problem as alcohol is prohibited except in foreign enclaves.
Finally, about time we stop relying on Saudi oil
Umm... you guys realize most of the electricity on earth comes from oil and coal power plants right?  Stop being stupid.
Nah oil won't go away.
Hello Egg Foo Young
Oh wow, all these plans are total bullcrap. Saudis are totally effed. Shame.
Just because they wore funny attire doesn't mean they are stupid. Man, stop this prejudiced mindset. Those people aren't stupid. That's why they are rich now. They didn't became Iran, Venezuela and Nigeria. All of them has an oil but no rich.
Everyone mocking Saudi ever since. Now look at them. Also they ain't that stupid. Before investing they first conducted research and analysis on success of the investment.
I had never seen or heard mbs speak before and its quite ironic for the leader of a country with such homophobic laws to be so fruity 💅 interesting, to say the least, maybe the call is coming from inside the house
Sounds like a massive money-laundering scheme, combined with simply attempting to exchange a natural resource rentier economy to rentier economy reliant on owning a portfolio of assets overseas. Ask Nauru how that one went.
"Peak Oil" is a fallacy and demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of the economics of resource extraction and utilization.
Is this video sponsored by Saudi government? Cause you didn't mention anything about Assassination of Jamal Khashoggi
in most places green H2 is an inefficient dead end, but if saudi arabia with it's ideal solar climate could make cheap green h2 possible , the technology could become viable and it would get us off of the short range evs ...
Like Jeremy Clarkson and James May said Jeremy: _"So if you're watching this in saudi arabia_ (burst out in mocking laughter and starts pointing, waves it mockingly away while he reclines in his chair) _,time to break out your camel."_ James: _"It's back to carpets for you"_
Oil will last much longer. Oil reserves regenerate over time, because their formation is an ongoing geologial process
I think Arabia in general sucks. The climate is very bad. I hate hot. I'd rather be cold than sweaty.
7:21 the tower construction stopped for a political reasons so it safe to assume it may not make the final cut
Lmao what a joke. It's all a big mirage
I find it interesting that a lot of these plans for the Saudis seem removed from the broader economic and social trends of the century. Globalism is coming to an end yet their tourism model, and indeed entire labour force, relies on the assumption that they will be able attract people easily.
I love your videos
As a Saudi, you thinking that any of the money goes down to us is hilarious lol
I saw this video title that said aspirin something something cancer. I didn't watch it but it makes sense now that aspirin is derived from oil.
Sub Saharan Africa demographic is skyrocketing. They will buy the oil from saudis instead.
When Saudi government started funding university as a way to increase education in population, it ended with 90% of all saudi university students to study "usefull" fields like teology and islam .... call me sceptical but with that kind of population I do not see a way for them to become an industrialized country.
Commenting for the algorithm, excellent Video. Day 42 of me asking you to make one on Uganda!
This video is BS, the global south & their developing economies are heavily reliant and will continue to be well into the 21st century, the demand for oil by the developing global souths’ economies is not ending anytime soon. Oil is here to stay for a long time, this is just a fact  Get your facts right.  The world is not just G7.
Recently Saudi also move big into eSport. They'll organize major eSport event in Saudi around mid 2024
@2:03 Bruh where's the potassium!?
Oil will not finish 😂😂😂
7:48 I’m glad they played Spec Ops, what a great game
I would not be so quick to count Saudi Arabia out. Mohammed bin Salman Al Saud or MBS, which is his hip nick name, is not a fool and I have faith that if anyone can turn that ship he can. Not saying every idea is a winner, or even close, but the man seems very level headed and capable from what I have observed. Good luck MBS. I am rooting for ya man!
"responsible"
I never want to go to Saudi.
It will be a robot camel, an A. I Camel.
Good luck saudi
I'd be interested in skiing there, but as I always a take a beer break in the middle of a ski day, it might be a problem if it's "dry" there.
Wow, listen to all of those Ozimadian nightmares saudi is planning.
Gonna ignore the little dig at climate activists for the entertaining and interesting info
Also, isn't the most of so called Private Sector of SA owned by royal family members?
They’re Arab, it’s the Muslim world. To me it’s a place that will never be cool or hip. It’s hot, and no fancy megastructure is going to get my ass on a plane to visit that archaic desert.
The winter games will be held in Trojena and it reaches average sub zero levels in winter
Carbon capture is a greenwashing bs
yeah maybe it’s a bad idea to spend all your money on lavish lifestyles for the rich and powerful instead of actually developing your country
Bollocks
I lived there for 20 years. 95 % of locals are lazy, arrogant and incompetent. It is a welfare state. All Labour is done by 3rd world labourers. Pipe dreams and white elephants in this video
It’s still going to be a strict Muslim country.
I feel bad for MBS and his $trillion family fortune. How will they survive?
Dumb question, why not ALSO invest in massive education programs that could tap into a young population to feed into these new projects and sectors?  The way you explained implies most projects will be executed by foreign specialized workforce.
At least the Saudi's can actually see the writing on the wall that oil consumption is going to decrease.  At least they already are starting to diversify with these gambles.  They know if it doesn't pay off, they are going to like the video said fade in obscurity.
Why can't the Saudis just make Atlantis 2.0, the rings are already in Mauritania, just gotta make that in Arabia
i love how you used funny graphics to help us understand more,  kinda entertaining.
Smoky and hunter with the Saudi paint, nice
I like how everyone acting like the country is like a bank and property manages. Yes just invest it and the money will be there for generations. Ummm....you know they have to defend their wealth and crown against hostile jealous neighbors. So alot of their wealth has to go for security. That cost money.
Im gonna be honest here. You cant pay me to travel to saudi arabia
They have unlimited money from pilgrims coming in....
The same things were said about Dubai when it was a desert. They said it was just a bubble and it would end, but they succeeded Let's see what happens in a few years and judge. The last conference, dependence on oil increased from 70% to 30%. We succeeded early. We expected it in the year 2030.
No we won't use less oil, simple fact is more people more energy, just look at the charts we add energy sources but the old sources continue to be used more... so being sarcastic like its obvious when in fact it's not true
The US has centuries in reserves and investing in wind is peak insantity. All these countries want to shoot themselves in the foot.
Not this peak oil shyt again.  They said that 40 years ago.
Nobody wants to travel to a regressive Islamic country. Soon to be the future of France and Germany lol
Bullsheet, the earth will never run out of oil.....
please don't call china a superpower
If nobody wants their oil anymore they can always use the energy to mine bitcoin and fund their economy that way. They'll have the cheapest energy and they probably won't be forced to become green
oil isn't going to peak because demand falls, not within 10 years anyway. unless something really surprising happens... saudi arabia will be profiting from oil for a long time. not to mention they have huge amounts of natural gas
Another myth. The ENTIRE Rocky Mountains are shale, AKA virtually infinite oil. Gahar produces LOW QUALITY oil. Much of shale oil will run gasoline engine unrefined. 0 comparability.
Ev are unreliable look at the cold weather we had 3 wks ago and ev cars wouldn’t even start ev is a gimmick waste of money and we ate being pushed towards them saudis are spoilt specially salman bin
Thunderf00t had a good video on linear city
If we could be so lucky
If Saudi Arabia wants tourists then it's going to need to make massive changes not just to its own culture but Islam as a whole. Even IF Saudi Arabia becomes a beacon of progressive values having neighbours who still kill gays/apostates, perform female genital mutilation, perform the occasional honour killing and generally treat women like garbage then it's still going to put a stain on SA's reputation. They need to de-emphasize the stranglehold Islam has on nearly every facet of middle eastern culture.
you are dreaming.  Oil demand will increase for centuries.
Yeah because trickle down economics has worked so well everywhere else.
I see otherwise. Saudis want to be the promoters of Islam and conquer the world with subsidized mosques, as they are doing already in Europe.
Tourism means partying and drinking, that just doesn't go with the Islamic culture of SA.
hearing green energy people constantly lie about "peak oil" demand or production is always funny, imagine thinking that these liberal governments who are running our civilization into the ground could actually even build the infrastructure to support battery powered cars. fully electric by 2028? give me a break, why don't you ask hertz how well their electric vehicle fleet program is working, or Germany the leading green energy country how it's power grid is doing.
How many gigajoules worth of energy is in the oil that we want to replace? Id say thats like a new nuclear reactor every year for the next 50 years.
I follow a lot of people who live in KSA and the culture shift I see seems rather good. The old strict norms are fading away and they even participate in Halloween which is very very Haram lol
I feel like they should of started these projects in the early 90s
If Saudi spend money on sensical things instead of having dumb dictator bamboozled by unrealistic CGIs and dumping money on useless contructions, Saudi probably has better chance at reducing oil dependency.
This won't work. Because they kiiiinda forgot about women's rights. Not gonna take my wife to a place where she is property.
When I see the comments, I remember the beginning of the emergence of Chinese companies in the field of manufacturing cars and electronic devices. We saw the extent of skepticism in China’s future, and now we see that China has become the world’s factory. There is no country that does not import from China, so I am very optimistic about the extent of the achievements made by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.
As a Norwegian, I'm not sure if we're the smart ones or KSA is. We're investing all our money into Meta, Alphabet, Microsoft and Apple, meanwhile KSA is investing in themselves...
5:44 MY MOM (pls help, mom. The building’s on fire)
15:27 How does it not matter if I think its true? A country pushing an image of itself that the rest of the world doesn't believe is exactly the problem the Saudis are dealing with.  And I don't think the image you described was an entirely manufactured look for Canada, it was a natural byproduct of a stable healthy country.
Whether you believe in climate change or not, whether you believe that humans have an input and can still slow it down or not, the data suggests that our lovely planet is getting hot 🥵 the Gulf countries will simply be impossible to enjoy in over 50/120 temperatures for half of the year 🥵🥵🥵 maybe, instead of this desperation to be cool 😎 with giga projects and rebranding efforts, they could invest in next gen heat capture and power the world 2.0
The saudis are even investing a lot into esports like counter strike with team falcons.
Carbon capture, lmao
Imho „the line” is genius! It will collapse and that ozymandian statue will be there for generations to come and see how money dont save you from dumb.
I know this video is a bit old but hoser how do you get the trade data visualization
I've said this for a few years now but Saudi Arabia will be a top five GDP in the world in the next decade. Oil demand is expected to go down but as the world tries to move away from oil it becomes more clear that it's not as straightforward and that no real alternatives today exist that will actually be sustainable. Meanwhile Saudi Arabia is sitting on more easily accessible and pure oil than anyone can even imagine, even the estimates are probably lower than the real reserves that exist. On top of this they are a relatively undeveloped country which is prime for big developments in the modern world, it's not like trying to rebuild NYC or an area in Germany where land availability is hard to come by and houses are already there with land ownership. Saudi Arabia is an underpopulated country for its size and has tons of available land for development in the modern world from the get go, this will be huge when compared to already developed countries that have to rework tons of existing infrastructure to meet the future demands of the world.  It will be more obvious in 2030 but pretty much my bet is as long as war doesn't hit Saudi Arabia they are on a potential for a huge economy and to become a major global power, ofc that depends on them surviving the West + Israel and walking that tight line of friend or foe with them.
EU electric cars target is cancelled due to electric cars being nothing but a pile of trash
Also what kind of tourists were they expecting? I don't think the average pleb can afford what they are offering to the tourists. All that money spent needs to be made back somehow and they sure won't charge $50 for a hotel in those resorts.
Doesn't matter how much money they spend or how much technology they acquire - they are unjust and cruel. You can't buy compassion.
They have the money to throw a lot of spaghetti at the wall; and maybe find some that'll stick. Individually, a lot of these projects dont make sense, yes; but thats bc the infrastructural context isn't there yet to give them a chance at working. Who knows, maybe their dumbest-seeming idea today will be viewed as astute foresight in 2060. It beats thinking that today will go on forever.
When Muslims flee war, hunger or political upheaval, they tend to flee to libertarian countries. Rich people and those who want to become rich, use their wealth to indulge in sex, drugs and alcohol. All things forbidden under Islam. It's why people prefer to go to western europe than some place in Asia or Africa stooped in conservatism. Until that mindset changes, MJB's plan is doomed to failure.
Kinda off topic but The Line is fricking stupid. If a single thing goes wrong somewhere that's not the edge, then you're stuck in your part of the thing. Why not make it a circle ???
To be fair, when you have the amounts of money Saudis have, anything can be possible.
Saudi tourism.....  Right....................
You're right about branding. I'll *never ever* visit evil places like Dubai, or any other tourist place in middle east.
If people are worried about the environment remember China is increasing coal power plants they're producing more carbon than everyone else together do and they're destroying the planet while they're at it and then North Korea is trying to neutralize all the water we have bye exploding nuclear bombs in the ocean because they're ground is way too loaded with nuclear waste
Next upgrade for type of vehicle I will buy hybrid plug in hybrids are long range comparison to all electric or gas and also not a massive fire hazard like all electric cars😊
The flag has Kalima in it, which you put on a camel in thumbnail. Pleas remove
They just bought ESL (counterstrike/starcraft) and disabled all comments/chat during games  They destroy everything they touch, this will be no different
Hey been saying we reach peak oil demand since the 1960s
Electric cars yes, but what material will you use for the dashboards etc?
I can tell you didn't study economics. Good video, but the conclusions were not correctly supported by data nor analysis.  In other words, I can't help and tell where you got lost because you don't show ypur numbers.
LOL - Oil is not done. How stupid.
Literally, the average Saudi works in all blue collar jobs, from a worker in petroleum stations to a waiter in restaurants, not to mention the high unemployment problem that we have.
This is a lie. The percentage of people among the Saudi population in terms of those who have completed higher education is equal to countries such as Portugal and the Czech Republic.

The foreign investment sovereign wealth fund is pretty much a guaranteed success. The rest I'm not so sure about.
this look like a PowerPoint slides for secondary school
Saudi's know the Western talk about reducing fossil fuels is just virtue signaling and the oil business will continue as usual.
Hey Hoser, I see you get a lot of things wrong in your videos, I am really sad to see the quality really fall behind with less and less effort or research being put in these videos It's pretty evident you're not researching or even looking up ANYTHING about Saudi Arabia's economy, If you really do research on your video topics you would clearly realize that Saudi Arabia is shifting AWAY from oil and looking into more future proof solutions like solar power, a lot of empty desert space with a lot of wind so they are doing that, and just please please look into it because I just don't like seeing some random lad absolutely talk about quite literally the Saudi economy in 1998. You're better than this Hoser.
I think the Line is actually intended to make outdoor spaces habitable via shielding from the sun.
@16:59 after just now learning this, that immediately makes that old American Dad episode where Stan moves to SA and likes life better there so much funnier. Particularly the scene where some local jumps ontop of some noun and starts singing, "Heeeeere in Saudi Arabiaaaa" before immediately getting shot by some policeman with an AK who dictates, "no singing in Saudi Arabia!" I get it now :3 Top kek
As a producer of oil and gas, what they also could have produced for cheap (apart from petrochemicals) is electricity. A lot of manufacturing needs cheap electricity. I looked it up and they set up an aluminum smelter that went online only in 2012 (negotiations started in 2019 with alcoa) - their first and only. Not sure who are the workers inside there - it would be unfortunate if most of the staff were not Saudi Nationals. 🙄 Someone in the comments pointed out that the average citizen isn't accustomed to hard work. They foresee this being a very big problem in the future.
I think it’s easy to look down on a country like Saudi’s Arabia because of their style of government but then you remember the house of saud employed a court wizard and I mean I would give up a lot if the means wizard is a viable career path.
Bruh Arabia saudia have tourist😂 oil not fact for them 😂
bro the fact that you have a camel sniffing on oil made me sub to you
Imagine going to saudi arabia for tourism.
Saudi Arabia has just revealed a valuable mining discovery underground, worth more than SAR 9.3 trillion ($2.5 trillion). This nearly doubles the 2016 estimates of SAR 5 trillion ($1.3 trillion).
Texas alone produces more oil than the Saudis. U.S is number one baby
saudi buy cheap diesel from russia ,resell  for profit
Why would I go to Arabia as a tourist? There are over a couple dozen cities in other countries I'd rather go to. Heck, there are a good number of places in just the lower 48 I'd go and visit on a days long road trip.
sand dunes doesnt really attracts tourists..canada and australia really are average  for family migrations..the US is the best way to risk your future to make it big..
As a saudi myself, I’m just worried about the future of my country i just hope it all goes well
Day 1 of asking hoser to make a video about libya
You couldn't pay me to go to Saudi Arabia. Combining a desert with city life, no thanks.
you should have said tanks instead of thanks at the end of the video XD
a lot of the information in this video are wrong. but what catch my eyes is this at 17:38 .  the avrige salary in saudi is about 34K USD. the education is less than Gabon!!!, literacy rate in Gabon is 85.69% and in Saudi is 99.38%. there are 29 gov universities and other 15 privet in saudi. in Gabon only 23. so please explan
17:42 that is 100 % not true where is the source from ?!!!
truth be told, i know a lot of people who works in saudi, and they always say that saudi people are lazy and always ask their foreign workmates to do  the work for them, in any work place you can always see saudi people gathering just to chat or smoke and the boss will do nothing even if he sees them. then.. how can you ask people to work if they dont want to work and just want to get paid?
Oil isn’t ending anytime soon in next 50 years …. The electric vehicle is only an answer for the people who can pay more for less efficiency overall to pretend it’s more environmental…  As Africa and Asia catch up to the western countries they will become more oil dependent…
Dollars don't exist without Saudi petro dollar 1971-1973! Good luck to all! Saudi don't need America, America need Saudi! Saudi Arabia spend money for built! America spend money to destroyed all with war! I assume a lot of America people (democracy) like war!!!  *Think before you wish something!* If you like playing stupid games, you get stupid price!
BULLSHIT!
MBS is our spirit and future, you cannot comprehend how much we (saudis) believe in him. We will make it happen, generations will be educated on what we are doing now.  “The impossible isn’t Saudi” MBS.
1- 17:30 The average income of Saudi Arabia citizen is around 2100$ a month not like canada which is around 4900$ a month. 2- finding a job is not easy as you claim. 3- housing is very very very expensive.
Great video keep it up!
Can anyone help explain in the most simplest way why diversification is important if your an oil producing country? I had a high school economics class a few weeks ago that discussed the topic similar to this, but the concept was a bit jarring and thought to myself why? Isn’t an oil country the big dog? And that’s why I want to also know why diversification was added to the mix.
Saudi sand looks like a great place for miles of solar panels though.  That's coming from me who knows little about economy and politics.
Oil is not finite. The earth produces more oil everyday. And has done so for millions of years. It is constantly making more oil underground. Oil is like water, a renewable resource.
Atleast they actually doing something to be better unlike other countries who focus on ehem wars
nonsense
Since when is China going Green?
Investing in becoming a tourism economy at this time is insane.  The western middle class is all but extinct and china's attempt at reconfiguring their economy to produce a strong middle class is floundering at best, not to mention that, even if the east or west would take their foot off Africa's throat, Africa is at least decades away from seeing that kind of broad economic transformation; and even if Japan had the weight to support that kind of thing, they don't, they're barely maintaining the status of their middle class by forcing them to work basically non-stop.  There's massive political unrest worldwide, the global economy's tanking, just...this plan is so desperately divorced from reality.
We reached peak oil in the 80's and the 90's and ....
it s okey. Saudis are on a revolutionary project that will save the country from total collapse. It is call "the line".
Oil isn't going away anytime soon you stand a better chance of electric cars taking ovrr the transportation
Saudi Arabia may attract the ultra wealthy, but I highly doubt ordinary folks will afford to go there.
Another click bait video with propaganda and lies Mecca and Medina are the two holiest cities in the 🌎  world Allah angels protect it some people don't have a sense of reality.
I love crown prince
I lived for 8-9 years in a country named Bahrain (30 minutes from saudi). Growing up I felt the fall of the gulf countries from a young age, the simple lack of education for the local population. To the lack of life in the gulf countries, its not wrong to say that most of the world is much more appealing to live in than the gulf. Western countries guarantee a much better life than you will get in countries like Saudi. No matter the amount of crazy projects they announce, once you step your foot on these lands you will realize they are very horrible to live in. The lack of activities, the lack of security, the lack of nature, the extreme horrible weather. This is not a permanent place to settle in, I found that out from a very young when asking my parents to go back to my home country. Why would I live in Saudi, when Canada(example that is mentioned in this video) gives me residency, a passport after a while living there. Compared to Saudi eliminating that option regardless of how long I lived there. Canada also allows me to own a nice home, in much nicer, diverse(yet easy to assimilate) and opportunistic environment. At the end of day, these nations spend billions in propaganda and tourism for their countries, just to get less people visiting than places like Mexico(known for being quite dangerous). Saudi will forever be a place that seems good in theory but was always destined not to work out.
Oil will not run out in a second. It will be a gradual change which will not affect the economy that much. Saudis are also investing the oil money so, stop this propaganda bullshit
Isn't a photo of green camel with arabs sings snoring oil a racist as fuck?
Oil is the future. Please use as much as you can. Avoid toxic solar panels and wind turbines at all cost.
waits though georgian national animal is european byson
There are will be always need fro crude oil, no matter what.
They’ve been predicting peak oil since the 1970’s. One of the many reasons I don’t trust anything that comes out of their mouths.
And another thing only stupid people call investments gambling
🇸🇦🇸🇦🇸🇦🇸🇦🇸🇦🇸🇦
There is debate on how much reserve the Saudis actually have.
Hehehe...are you listening Alberta?
1km tall building
Climate Change will end most if not all of their "dream" projects, not that they are really good ideas anyway. The Line is such a ridiculously stupid concept and they probably know it, but it helps them to brand themselves as progressive and make people forget the beheadings of women or the killing of critical journalists.
oil is gonna stay for a long time lol
that ad break was creative.  Saudi has nothing but oil.
Oil is used to make hundreds of other products and if they play well they can produce those products for the whole world(cheaper than anyone else). Also oil  will be used for trucks, ships, airplanes...of course amount will be way way less but still they can sell a lot of it.
Demand for all has never been higher and with India rapidly industrializing the demand is only going to skyrocket even more.
17:40 How do you say that the average Saudi is less educated than the average Gabonese when the graph shows Saudi over Canada? ☠☠
Its at least good that they have a leader who sees the writing on the wall, but the specific plans to change are so idiotic.
So $200 per barrel soon, got it.
There's a problem with their "vision" no one wants to come set up a bank or tech company in Saudi Arabia (if they have any sense) - theological dictatorships are notoriously corrupt, fickle and make dumb decisions on internal and foreign policy.  I think some sort of representative form of government would be their first step if they were going to take this seriously - but that's about as likely as Iran doing the same. Once the oil is gone, the deserts will take back over - money will dry up and no one will give a shit about Saudi Arabia.  They will use what remaining, working weapons they have to fight over thousand year old blood feuds and religion...since they can't really see past that.
Do danmark please hoser
Yes, ok, we supposed to hit peak oil for like 5 times in the last 50 years yet here we are. On the other hand the world population is likely to start decreasing soon, so yeah, we'll need less oil, but it's like 20 years away not 4 years away.
This is bias... "OPEC cartel" we have a Biden supporter here.
No taxes, huge central planning, and half the citizens work for the government?  So SA is "communism for rich people?" (I mean, economically, not the overt religious bits.)
Saudi Arabia as tourism spot? 😂 Their investment in spreading extreme Islam is their undoing. Nobody wants to spent holidays in a country with gruesome Jihadi image. Muslims only go there for religious reason, and then go back home. Even Muslims didn't think Saudi Arabia as tourism spot, the place to enjoy life which lead to sins, but a place to perform religious practices and to cleanse sins. It is too late for Saudi Arabia to change the image they themselves created through their religious clerics and extremist groups.
They have no beauty in their hearts. No one wants more modernistic junk and 'futuristic cities'. It's soo hollow and immature. Not to mention the human rights violations that have happened in that country that they reallllly want us to forget.
A literal utopia, of tech, money and freedom……….. as long as you’re not gay…..😊
Saudi arabia's gonna fail. The majority of their projects can be summed up as "a rich mans playground"
oil is running out soon
For sure the branding thing and getting eyes there. The way boxing has moved there still looks strange and eerie because of... well..branding. The way we know Saudi doesn't rhyme with such activities. Been so curious about just what is happening there, and what all is about; the Ronaldo, diplomatic beer and stuff. Now I know. Thanks for such a comprehensive, well researched, informative and entertaining, as well as a well put together piece.
it will have a revolution like Iran in 1979
Give it a year and oil will be so back
When we've had zero-point energy that draws infinite energy from the quantum vacuum for over 50 years and electrogravitic transdimensional vehicles that are capable of interstellar travel, but we're still using f'ing oil and shit lol.
700 billion dollar fund / 19 million Saudi citizens (i know total population is larger, but 19 million is the rough number of Saudi) = 36 850 USD. At the absolute maximum. 5% of this fund can be siphoned each year and still maintain the size of the fund. 1850 dollars a year... This is not going to end well.
We will still need oil for non car production. The move away from oil will definitely impact the gdp of the mid east but there’s still so many byproducts used in everything
Neat
The west is losing it's grip on the economy. Nobody likes them shitty EVs anymore.
Don't move to Canada, trust me. Cost of living will give you depression.
You definitely worked at CNN before
Betting your nations future on a public investment fund not the brightest idea but I hope it works for them this is why power shouldn’t be centralized
the saudi royal family will go broke shortly AFTER the earth plumets into the sun.
Smoothest sponser segway I have ever seen!
saudis invest in tourism when they already hit 55 celcius and temp will keep rising. pretty smart. it would make more sense if they invested in solar energy.
I think what the Saudi government is doing right now is very smart. They know they are entering a time of deep transition and require the trust of its citizens. The best way to keep people happy is to give them something to cheer for. Build them a new stadium, buy high level names, bring big events to drive excitement, that’s how you keep a populous distracted while changes are put in place. This could also lead to a tragic downfall of the entire Saudi society. In the event that these big plans fail, the government will be made a mockery of and it will fall back into the despair of oil. The Saudi elites need to make sure they can strike a balance of diversifying the economy while also using what is working to move ahead. This will be an interesting next couple decades from them.
There are no EV vehicles. Most run on oil making electricity. The US is going to get screwed by the Saudis. It happened when we went from the gold backed dollar to the petro dollar. The Saudis are now accepting Russian and Chinese currency making the US dollar worth a lot less.
I have been hearing this peak oil scenario for over 40 years. It's always coming but never gets here.
I dont understand how OPEC is allowed to operate in a free world. Or maybe I do understand, as long as you pay your taxes to the international finance, you are allowed to stay alive to suck the blood out of actual competitive industries.
The largest oil field in the world sits in Texas. The talk of peak oil is nonsense
this is why your country shouldn't be ally of USA
Saudi Arabia is very sensible.  Well done !
Heard this dog shart theory before
Since 1970 they've spent 200  billion petro dollars  spreading wahhabism all over the western world .
oil and gas are far from done. saudi arabia on the other hand is another story.
Good God the stupidity and ignorance here in the comments   is amazing.
"Peak oil" has been a decades old lie repeated by people who profit from it.
3:20 saudi no income tax cool!
I thought Kazakhstan exports mainly pubis and potassium
I thought Kazakhstan exports mainly pubis and potassium
This whole 2030 vision thing just seems like something a kid would think of
Dont tell me this is the reason why Tekken and Street Fighter have a character from Saudi.
MBS sanctions murder.
Wargame Red Dragon is another great example. All the vehicles are fuel hogs. Especially if you off-road.
I feel a moroccan video coming soon 😊
Had an uncle who worked in the Kingdom for awhile. He told me the Grimmest joke he'd ever heard. It goes "An extremely elderly man spoke to me and said "When I was a young man I rode a camel, when my son was a young man he drove a BMW, when my grandson was a young man he drove a Ferrari, and when my great grandson becomes a young man he will ride a camel"
Doesn’t the US have a lot of oil as well we just ain’t allowed to tap into it?
well the US is the biggest oil producer now not KSA
The "experts" said that we'd hit peak oil in the 1970s, and they've been saying that every decade since then.
Oil isn't technically finite. It is technically infinite if you consider the sun to be infinite.
"Peak oil by 203X." Yeah, i've heard that one before, what happened to "Peak oil by 200X"?
I think it is extremely wasteful what they are doing, but probably more than 10% of the money are used on something useful, and the will have the money to subsidize stuff for a long time until eventually they learn what works and what doesn't.
It's sad that a country with so much wealth has modern day slavery. Capitalism is a joke.
Putting an image of a tank from Tanki online just before an ad for War Thunder (basically a tank game), LOL, the disrespect!
Click bait title from someone who is obviously crying for views. 0 soruces, basless propaganda predictions.  Also litteraly oil average has been steady and slightly growing year by year look up macrotrends if you exclude oil price war variances.  Keep hating we keep laughing all the way to the bank.  Get cucked.
I don't get why they don't invest heavily in schooling. Like that's how you maintain a large knowledge base on which to build an advanced nation.
A failed oil state built on corpses of slaves plans to invest in greenwashing? Interesting.
maybe this will prevent more Jamal Khashoggi incidents, not relying on saudi arabia as much
Unless they allow alcohol to be drank openly by everyone over there, then no one will go. Oh but woman can drive. lol
africa will probably become the top world consumer of oil soon as western countries develop away from it
You know what would make me come to Saudi Arabia? Their unique culture and history. I've got plenty skyscrapers, ski resorts and shopping malls at home already.
So.instead of being a rentier economy based on oil they just become a rentier economy based on stocks
Long live the Gulf, long live Saudi Arabia ❤
playing ck2 taught me that Islamic states eventually succumb to decadence.
They have been saying we will run out for 50 years. Oil is Abiotic, look it up. We have been lied to.
peak oil has been imminent for about as long as global warming.
I’m skeptical of any videos saying oil is done these days. Oil is definitely not done. 😂
M b S is the Be as t just youtube our film the prince of th e covena nt
No, Petroleum is not done. Literally everything you use is made from Petroleum including certain pharmaceuticals. Petroleum has an amazingly high variety of useful chemical compounds, we will likely never stop finding new uses for it.  Oil, unlike Coal is also geographically concentrated in a few regions throughout the world. Also not all Petroleum is the same. Oil from the Gulf states is the easiest to exploit and this region will likely produce oil for the rest of the century. Assuming that the region does not collapse into endless conflict.  Meanwhile Russian oil risks going off-line. Venezuela won't be producing lots of oil any time soon. That means Oil has a bright future ahead of it.  The day Oil is done is when the current Global Civilisation itself is done.
I haven't and won't watch the video but can tell everyone who honestly thinks that oil can die (why? Because we all get "green" now, I suppose...) that oil never died (as it isn't fossil) and never will (as demand will always be there, forget your wet green dreams...)
Crowned prince bonesaw is his name eh.
Please I have to add: China IS NOT, and I repeat as loud as i can IS NOT INVESTING IN RENEWABLE ENERGIES, yes they build stuff for the renewable energy market but in domestic use they still build new coal powerplants.. China is the worst player when it comes to environment
Was wondering about this, thanks for the entertaining educational content.
Way too much just for the sake of public servant  They need to push people to their limit,like if u want to take those jobs, u need to be qualified in others country wellknown job like working on NASA or CERN
I think the collapse will be very bad maybe a lot of refuges to europe which Turkiye probably gonna reject or might get funded by Nato to shelter them But If it happens that was there will be a whole on civil war in Turkiye It's still really critical with situations with refugees in Turkiye as I'm living in it. The President Of Turkiye makes them citizens so they can vote in to him for him to stay longer with elections. Which the Turkish people are really stressed and angry I believe there will be a big Saudi and Turkiye genocides and terrorists activies.
The Saudis will be a relic of the past 😂
What a video!! Watched this today and I’ve never been so addicted to watching a YouTuber in my life.
Oil is just getting started. Demand keeps rising and will continue to do so.
There is nothing in the world known to us that is sufficiently abundant and not difficult to obtain that can replace oil, coal and gas. There is nothing that even comes close.
❤❤❤❤❤
This is just nonsense
Saudi Arabia really does not need to worry. We will need more and more energy.  Photovoltaik and Wind Power are being built because they are very cheap, not because of political pressure. Our debt based economies will try and change the energy needs per person, but will fail to do so.  When all is said and done we will burn oil until there is none left on earth, because cheap energy will always be THE determining factor of economic growth.
Click bait and total misinformation.
1:16 mister bone saw
Petro-Dollar Economies such as those in the GCC will be in trouble once the demand for fossil fuels is replaced with other technologies or substitutes.  Only UAE is one country, which has worked out some sort of a plan by diversifying its economy thereby reducing reliance on hydrocarbon resources, as seen in Dubai.  Bahrain was another model during the 1990s, but, somehow, is in economic trouble, as it has lost its status as the Regional Islamic Banking Hub to Dubai, since DIFC, and other projects came to the fore over the last two decades.
Fake news. This is a lie
I think the Saudis are doomed to fail eventually. Without oil, there really isn't any reason for the county to exist in the first place. The investments aren't going to last forever either, and without any other industries to fall back on, theyre bound to be the first casualties the moment anything disturbs the current world system.
Kind of unlikely.
U can’t pay me to go to Saudi for vacation.
they might try their hands on farming !
just about everything 'made with oil' can be made in other processes, and as oil runs out we will do without it
Aramco bought Valvoline like it was nothing
None of those fancy project will save them. They will go back to poor desert tribes real quick.
Perhaps instead of reducing the amount of money going to the people, they can keep paying the people with shares of stock in these industries they're investing in? That way, they can sell the few shares of each stock they get IF they need the cash, or hold the shares, tighten their belts (which is what the gov't wants them to do anyway), and then make even more potentially if the stock takes off! Then their wealth is in their OWN hands!
Eyy the esl one colonge 2015 hitting home as a CS nerd <3
Sua-di Arabia is the Empire of Evil. Through its money terror is funded. The only reason why there is so much oil underneath the unholy kingdom is for the fact that the place of judgement after day of judgement is Saudi Arabia.
I'm pretty good at detecting segway ads before it happens but that War Thunder transition was too smooth I didn't see it coming at all.
-world tries to distance itself from oil Like what countries in particular? My man's world starts in California and ends somewhere near Berlin, lmao  So far none of predictions you made are true, same as wowmao and I think literally every "free thinker" in western hemisphere I suggest you must at least visit once a country you making video about my bruda
I went from hearing videos about hitting peak oil production to ones about peak oil demand in a year!
Being a religiously reserved country in a desert they should have focused on buying resource and land in other countries using the oil money rather than bringing non Muslim and party tourist into country, which  will make the religious people more mad and act in a more extreme way. As a moderate Muslim, I wish the best in both Muslim and western world so i hope there wont be a clash of culture and waste of money in Saudi Arabia.
Great vid.  I wonder if you are able to abbreviate the United States in a video like this, cuz I need a refresher what the fuck is going on.
Mate... More oil for them... Y'know, you can always make shit with energy
Yeah for sure.. The less europe or the US buy, the more will india, China, Vietnam and other countries buy up. They'll have customers for at least another 100 years. More oil means more wealth for emerging economies.
Ads transition was brilliant
They've been predicting Peak Oil incorrectly since the 1950's. Sorry, but the track record is TERRIBLE.
this channel has the sh*ttiest predictions of all time lmao hoser? more like loser.
Pog u got arabic naming right except abqaiq it’s pronounced ab-kaik not abkayek
Or they can buy another country 😝 just incase if they need
If their idea of being unique is building huge Cube and huge Line and call them "cities", it's going to fail.
This makes me want to move to saudi arabia for some petrodollars
EV's areDEAD!!!!
This is going to age as well as their prediction models of climate change.  🤣
buddy, oil is more alive than ever, have you seen whats happening to EVs? oil IS VERY alive, make no mistake.
As a Russian im a little bit anxious about the future of my country, without oil export, without industry and probably still in some kind of conflict
I don't think investing only on entertainment in your country, which mostly is made up of unliveable areas is clever. Especially when up to north there is Turkey. Which always been the crossroads and holded politic power while not beeing too friendly with the west or the east. As a Turk with no real wealth, I live in a country (let's keep the politics out) wtih full of riches from history to natural beauty and is kind of a bridge between two worlds. So, if you have ambition you might be able to make it. And even if that does not work out, also if my government job does not pay me no more, I have a land inherited from my father to work on. Our founder Atatürk had founded most of the industries that hold Turkey up in these hard times (Erdogan's times). Those were, first meant to be our own Industries to keep us satisfied, second an income to government as exports.   Long story short, why put your own future on so thin ropes as touristic places on a desert than some clothing factory, R&D on farming industry  and such that will keep your people fed even though there is not much wealth to ride luxury cars or live in clouds.
So did Saudi Arabia see how Nauru ended up and say hold my camel milk
This whole video is about how the Saudis just discovered what investing is... I wonder if earning interest is Haram or is it only charging interest is haram?
1:45 That's Persian Gulf
Im pretty sure, that you could use renewable energy, for electric tanks, you fight within this energyproducers and can use them until they are destroyd, the alternative is a fuelsupplychain that can be overstretched. But i doubt the future of tanks, a 2000$ drone destroys a 15,000,000$ tank plus valuable personel as we see in the actual war.
Reminder to NOT visit Saudi Arabia
lololololol peak oil bahahahaha
It should be pointed out that the main problem with Venezuelan oil is not mountains and jungle making it hard to access, but that it is low-value heavy oil, high in carbon and low in hydrogen, as opposed to the Persian Gulf's light sweet crude.
We have like 47y of oil left 😊
Just saying they're building a "500trillion$ city" is enough to give them "prestige", they don't need to actually make it. It's just marketing.
So basically they are putting all their eggs in the basket of what looks like a financialized western economy, as financialized western economies are beginning to crumble. This obviously can't go wrong.
I'm almost certain this will fail. There's a reason why dictator or autocratic economies do significantly worse than market-based economies. It's impossible for one person to make the right decisions when they've suppressed opposition for so long that no one dares tell them the truth.
Calling china a superpower, okay...
Damn Tanki online in this video🙃
*laughs on my veggie oil diesel*
Yah, building for tourists while the west is becoming a 3rd world country doesn't seem like it will work out well.
It does take a moron to think that renewables and electric cars are actually viable
All this nonsense like EVs are a fraud. Oil isn't going anywhere no matter how much those clowns at "just stop oil" warm the roads.
NOT TRUE. downvote + reported for misinformation.
Never lived or studied in/about Saudi, but did all that in Qatar for years. Qatar is dependent on gas, but they also have extremely savvy investments around the world. They own real estate in major cities, they have large shares of powerful companies, and they have growing political influence given the hotbed of sociopolitics that is the Middle East. Saudi has a pretty similar situation so I imagine it has a couple ways out once the fields run dry.
Manufacture an electric car without oil and I will be impressed
Saudi Arabia will need to get real socially progressive real fast if it wants any chance of making a dent in average consumer markets.
base on their natural instinct (saudi having nothing yet prosper for centuries) I believe that they somehow manage to stay afloat in whatever crazy way
all EVs by 2035 sure ain't happening, let alone all EVs on the road which is many decades later...
Saudi Arabia is nothing but sand if not of its oil. You would have to pay people to go there.
So... the Saudis need to exploit their oil reserves before everyone converts to EV.  So they plan to increase production capacity, which will drive down global oil prices.  Lower oil prices will undermine government EV initiatives around the world.  Thus extending international oil demand, keeping the Saudis in the money for a while longer.  As the unapologetic owner of a gas guzzler, I am smiling right now.
Bull***Shit.
They want tourists, maybe stop stoning women js
Electric cars are not reliable and require a downtime anywhere between 30 mins to 12 hours depending on how much power is left in the battery to charge. There is also an increase in cars catching on fire because lithium-ion batteries can catch fire under any circumstances according to Kia, an automobile manufacturer. Furthermore, rural areas are not likely to have a charging station which hinders movement for electric vehicles, and it is expensive for companies to replace low-cost diesel trucks and ships for electric vehicles without imposing additional costs to the consumers. The idea that electric vehicles are more environmentally friendly is a myth as lithium mining requires lots of fresh water and damages the surrounding ecosystem and wildlife. Electric cars also require lots of electricity that are often generated from fossil fuel such as coal and natural gas-powered plants which make up around 58% of electricity generation worldwide in 2022.
I wanna watch this closely because if planned economy with the funding level of Saudi still do not work, please let this put an end to the debate of weather planned economy will ever work
Of course it's insane and the projects are kooky but there is no denying this, that guy IS TRYING to do the best thing for his country, its citizens and their future. Now can you say that about the leader of YOUR country?  Yeah, thought so.
I'm not interested in having my head chopped off because I broke some obscure religious edict. Unless they get rid of Wahabism, there won't be too many non-muslim tourists.
Their barbaric and backwards treatment of women and LGBTQ+ people is still a disgrace and will hold back tourism for sure.  Some people just can’t set foot there.
so opec and gcc control ksa ¡!
خيبر من طين الكعبة من ذهب !
I think it is a great point that you mentioned Canada and how it is perceived by the world and why. I would like to add that that people immigrating to Canada also have the chance at citizenship. So unless Saudi changes that and allows immigrants/foreigners to become Saudi citizen, I don't think people will like to visit and contribute to Saudi economy.   No one wants to work for an economy that later kicks you out.
Blah blah blah, the industry always "predict" that production peaked at some point current+10 years, since 1902.
wait so your telling me that by playing war thunder I can learn all that there is to know about the Saudis big gamble with oil all from a tank and aircraft simulator?, cool ill check it out some time
Sounds like bulshit
All of those projects the Saudis are funding…. am I the only one who finds these gulf construction projects trying to show off random excess just tacky and lame? There’s no culture or authenticity to it. The e-sports stadium? Like how is that of any use to 99.9% of the population?
never in human history have an energy source been abandoned. every time we found a new superior one, we added it to our existing stockpile and started spending it, but the old ones kept increasing too. The idea that we can transition out of oil is therefore delusional. Especially considering that we have yet to find a superior energy to oil. Fusion could be one, but we don't have it yet.
Ah yes, another random youtuber that is clearly not paid or influenced to make a video bashing gcc countries for false or half truths because the west finds those countries as a real threat. Saudi and UAE(it's UAE not just Dubai) are a billion times more humane and advanced than any 1st world country, and let's not even try comparing safety and that there is avery big rise in europeans and americans relocating to there because it's a really big upgrade to live in gcc over pretty much anywhere else in the world except maybe some places that can be counted on one hand.
You know what they also use oil for? Pop filters. Maybe you should invest in one.
I'd only be exaggerating slightly if I said that people have been predicting peak oil since the time of Edward Longshanks.
Its a miracle america havent tried to freedomize saudi because of its oil
thank you for teaching me the term "rentier" today 😁
Regarding the Line, aka the Neom Project, Adam Something said it best: Smoothbrain Dictator + Infrastructure Project = Dumb Shit.
If you invest in everything you will achieve nothing.
"Ending oil"  is WAY different than "No longer burning oil for fuel".
Gambles aside, there are also some sensible projects to secure the future wealth of Saudi Arabia (KSA). The country has great potential in mining — copper and gold in particular — which is now being opened up. Also,  KSA has a sovereign wealth fund. This is presently of modest size in relation to its oil reserves, but could be built up to be of major significance, as with other oil-rich states in the Arabian Gulf and elsewhere (notably, Norway).
The Line is gonna become Wall-E's city
Nahh the arabic is on point 😂😂
babe wake up new hoser video just dropped
This is a pretty well researched video it’s accurate and simple well done
Can they not get some giant worms for the desert?
Honestly I feel like these are not investments but giants ego boost for the ruling class, there is no way a sky resort makes it's money back
I cant just think but how skewed messed up effect on world economy spending trillions of $ just coz money burns in pocket does.
How do we get the minerals needed for renewables out of the ground by 2028 with less oil?
No such thing as peak oil.  We will never run out of oil which is actually a renewable source of energy.  Empty fields replenish themselves all the time; it’s why oil companies will return to old fields to work again.  The oil is made from all organic matter(not dinosaurs) and it’s the blood of earth.  Like the blood in your body it’s all replenishable; as above so below.  In order to turn the deserts to forest it would require a LOT more carbon in the atmosphere.  Without carbon there is no trees, plants, food, or humans.  The material world would melt like a wet painting without carbon.
I think the world will end before the oil runs out, every century they repeat this story😂😂
I dont think the solution is going all electric, people think that it is the best, while getting batteries pollutes a lot and themselves are not reneable.   The right answer is in the balance between electric and oil. Let houses be powered by green and cars (for rxample) by oil.
Canada is a shithole where you can be mugged for a dose of fentanyl and sent to jail if you misgender some street trash.
The meaning of the term "Peak Oil" was always referring to the easy accessible oil. We are already after Peak Oil. It peaked between 2004 and 2008. So, the start of the video is already wrong.
Oil does not run out. It replenishes by itself. Its all a massive lie.  Even if not, it would not matter at all.  They have all the money they need to move into other venues.  All these Dommsday porn is utter garbage.
There is NO chance that Saudi Arabia spends its way out of economic disaster. The more they invest in these huge projects now, the earlier an more precipitous the fall will be later. I give them credit for at least trying, but there is absolutely no chance of actual success without somehow ditching the vast majority of their population. (Which could be accomplished by making one or more of these projects geopolitically separate from Saudi Arabia proper, and is probably the smartest selfish move they can make.)
Some reasons that make me pessimistic about the futuristic plans of MBS.  1- The Middle East is not stable, many bad actors can easily break the peace and all we know is that wealth fleeing from instability.  2- Nature is stronger than our current tech and tech is not sustainable, with global warming and increasing average temperature there is a high chance that Saudi become inhabitable. 3- Shah the last king of Iran had similar ideas for making Iran one of the first-world countries, but that plan faded after the 1979 revolution. there are many reasons why the 1979 revolution happened, but rapped unbalanced development is one of the most accepted, and Saudi is not famous for being Liberal or accepting relativism that comes from the modern world.  I really hope the best for Saudi Arabia and all Persian Gulf states, and I hope people leave the extremist ideas behind and work together to make a brighter future, we had enough wars and bloodshed in the region.
My friend in Saudi Arabia lamentes that women can drive. Even before they were not stopped for driving illegally but it was socially expected that the driver would take them or pick it up and she didn't want to learn to drive.
Put a linear particle accelerator in the line
Saudi oil is easily accessible definitely, and it's one of the cheaper grades of oil. That's part of the problem, Saudi oil is extremley dirty and low grade compared to other oil found in other places. And the lower their reserves get the dirtier the oil is. They have some very sandy and sulfurous oil, cheap is the only reason people will buy the stuff. They are not in a very good position for the future.
Are you kidding? I am Canadian & immigrants are leaving because of greedy investors  without long-term plans& immigrants are leaving because the cost of living is turning Canada into 3rd world country if actions are not taking place. Milking civilians & immigrants & increasing too much population is Canadians' big concern because the government trick people to immigrate there.
6:47 I wonder how many Saudis got triggered by this.
Yooo thanks so much for spreading the word of our country!🇸🇦🤍💚😁I feel the government is taking a big risk but I trust in the end it will be worth it. Also I appreciate the factual information and is actually very accurate to our situation rn and I also really like your humor😂
oil was gift from dinosaurs.
The video is very well researched
the snail is appears where ever i go. please gayjin leave me alone, i'm not gonna sell my soul.
The line is the perfekt example of why they arent on a path of succes right now, because they have so much money, instead of creating sustainable profitable industries, they create a liability.
Apple is 3 Trillion Dollar company.
Really great breakdown and informative analysis.  I have to really give props to the Saudi royal family for seeing the writing on the wall and getting into anything and everything to expand their economy.  The biggest issue will be that cushion job for their citizens. Why would anyone give that up for a private sector risk? I think most people are not looking to get rich but to live as comfortably as possible. This also means they can be as inefficient as possible because there’s no risk to lose the job.   Second it’s very difficult to convince anyone to leave their homeland and everything they have for a new country. Especially if it’s very different from their own culture
If it comes down to it. Money can´t safe saudia arabia it´s a totalitarian monarchy where women are property and you can get killed for beeing gay. Countrys like that tend to stay shitholes.
the orange vests worn by some "activists" are made by oil too 🙂
Isn't fertilizer made with Phosphorous?
Nooo! I am Saudi and I just got my job as a roustabout on training in an oil company after being jobless for 6 years. Are you telling me I might lose my job? Am I going back to being unemployed? I was just thinking about getting married. This video ruined my plans and my whole life. Still it’s good to keep up with the news. I should learn more skills to escape this uncertainty.
did you know saudi arabia's greatest cultures are built from slavery labors to this very day
contract workers is a nice way to word modern slavery
narrator needs to drink some water
I think they still have a safety net which is the Muslims Pilgrimage. It is the most profitable tourism spot in the world.
MBS is scared because without oil he's just a regular murderer that can be tried in international courts...
Props for showing Formula E at 13:17 instead of just another F1 picture. I also love the seamless transitions to and from the War Thunder ad.
I’ve been to Saudi Arabia. Not interested in seeing it again 🤣
Arabian Gulf??? it's Persian Gulf dude
If USA doesn't sabotage it and stop blackmailing the saudis, Saudia will become the leader in everything
Must be high on oil to think that there are rich tourists elsewhere in the world who are richer than them to visit them and spend money. Like the China's miscalculation of their population.
Correction. America invests in renewable energies. China invests into faking it.
15:30 HOLD UP !! nah fam, Canada is where people go when they can't get into the US ... thier BRANDING is screwed
Lets put some perspective. Coal is even more villainized than oil..... and we still burn coal for powerplant food. Yeah, oil will be in demand for a very long time, even if its not for car fuel, you still need to produce electricity for all those EVs, a reality that CA is still having trouble facing years after its "EV Push"
One of the best sponsor transitions ever.
They should invest into pharmaceuticals massively , ultimately even if we stop using petrol and others for fuel we need oil for pharmaceuticals and other uses that aren't fuel . Pharmaceuticals are also extremely profitable of course .
Let's see, in the 80s we had 20-30 years left before oil ran out.  What year is it now?
just because a car is electric doesn't mean it doesn't use oil.  the best places can only get about 30% of their CURRENT electric needs from renewable energy.    electric cars are about control.  they wont save the world, they get less then 1 MPG.  you can put a gallon of gas in an electric generator and use it to charge an electric car.
I don't see why people think we will use oil/gas for plastics and chemicals when we stop using it for fuel. We don't need oil/gas to make plastics. It's just hydrocarbons. Plastics is essentially a by-product that comes out for free from the refining process when making fuels. If we don't refine oil for fuels, there's no reason to think oil-based plastics would continue to be competitive with bio-plastics. Especially considering that many countries will probably seek to become more self-sustainable. Until you get rid of dependence on fossil fuels, there's no reason to even try being fully self-sustainable. But when fossil fuels are no longer necessary, why make yourself dependent on countries like saudi-arabia when you could easily make the plastics and chemicals yourself from biological hydrocarbons? There will be a ton of R&D going into that in a decade or so, and I think mass-scale seaweed farming will provide the hydrocarbon feedstocks. For coastal nations there will be huge benefits since they'll also create new habitats for fish which improves fishing sustainability.
Ctrl - F "Wahhabi" .. mmhmm
Is it supposed to be alive?
0:41 they don´t, just carbon neutral. Efuels will discontinue oil by 2050
Oil is... renewable.  Think high pressure composting.
They’re gambling on tourism, but their islamic laws scare half the world.
Cool stuff but they are still Arabs after all.  Racism can save a lot of money 🤔
This isn't going to go well if the state dictates what to make. It ought to give grants and let Saudis and foreign investors build businesses there
When you pump that much oil out of the ground does it just leave an empty void in the ground, or do they fill it with water? Does this cause sinkholes or collapse?
Couldnt happen to a better country and people, not….could care less as they are an evil country
Norway' the way to go with their economy
"Holy" city. 😂 the mosque use to be a pagan ritual site they even worship the same black stone on the corner.
The Saudis are going to have a tough time holding onto that oil once Iran comes knocking.
This a great economic shift to African with raw mineral resources.
We hit peak oil in 2017 as capacity has decreased every year, since then.  Not my opinion, it’s fact.  Oil-producing countries will return back to archaic times in the next 20-years as all new vehicles will be EV by then, powered by solar, wind, hydro and nuclear power.  We’ll only need oil for plastic production and asphalt roads, after that.
Electric cars (with litium batteries) are a scam and will one day be ditched
video for dreamers lol
The Kingdom of Saud is living on borrowed time. The people are SPOILED AND LAZY. Few nations more thorougly deserve what it has coming to it!
hoser: The line, do i even need to explain this?  *explains it
The first guy to drill an oil well went broke when everyone around him also drilled wells and he couldn't give away oil anymore. Ever since then the oil game has been one of getting control of the oil fields, shutting down production and keeping the price high. They use monopoly, government regulation, environmentalism and now global warming to restrict drilling. There will never be peak oil.
Kazakhstan mentioned 🎉🎉🎉
You're deluding yourself if you think we're actually gonna have all car sales be electric by 2035. And its not clear if oil is actually a finite resource, actually im gonna go ahead and say its not.
No amount of infrastructure or greenwashing can change their image. I mean, Canada conjures up images of nature, wealth, and democracy whereas when you say Saudi all you can think of is desert, scorching heat, and oppression. No amount of money can change that unless they totally liberalize their society, which will not happen soon.
19:40 Is this morocco?
is this an explanation of why SA is Iraq 2.0?
I find this video hilarious 😂 media is indeed the new "reality"
Oil money goes to MANY other places than Saudi Arabia...... That's not how the market works! Stocks? Speculation? And what other commodities have the same price fluctuations range? Oil companies and all others linked to them will be big players for a long time. Just take a look at Aramco right now!
Nobody ever said to their spouse.  “This year I want to go to a really long city for our holidays.” … Spending $400m on one Spanish golfer. Offering a billion dollars to a single soccer player to plays a couple of dozen games ($40m a game?) in front of a few hundred people in 40 degree heat.  We-work and vision fund.  They only make $500m a day.  I could literally name the golfers and soccer players that cost them month of revenues off the top of my head.   Saudi Arabia would be well advised to stop all investments now.
Iraq is trying the same thing. Do You think We Iraqis may have a better chance of making it since we have many natural resources other than oil?
Fuck Oil me and the Homies hate Oil
PERSIAN GULF
You play tanki online bro?!
Petroleum products are not going away. Just the demand as newer technologies come into play. Like the horse and carriage before it...
I’m wondering if the architects who cooked up all this can help spruce up North America, regardless of parking minimums.
predictions on oil production are historically wrong....
Why can't they just research bio fuel
They need to build self sustaining infrastructure, like transportation, education, agriculture, water distribution and sewage disposal.  And no surprise: they're gonna need women's rights too. No wonder they need to import foreign labor when they're locking half of their population from the job market. And that's not even considering the repercussions of tourism if you can't bring your wife without a hijab.  For energy needs, it's a desert, there's plenty of sun.  I don't want to be the armchair economist, I'm not a head of state. But I didn't suggest a Cube should be a city.
Don't forget that with global warming, most cities on the Gulf shores will become unhabitable.   Also, "science" is not something you can buy. As long as you believe that gays deserve death because some obscure funny guy said so 1400 years ago, well, you won't have gay visiting scientists nor science. Scientific approach means one has to be able to question everything, even religion and the king.
80% of USA  GDP is consumer spending. Maybe the UAE plan is not so crazy? When you consider what is happening with world finance.
Their image about innovation and luxury is nice and all but... The one things that makes me (and probably many others) think of Saudi Arabia as a no-go-zone is the fact that every single piece of media about them has never featured a single woman. The one time something with a female happened it was a not so convincing android that obtained Saudi citizenship as the first "woman citizen".  As long as women aren't being treated as equals to men in Saudi Arabia, I think a lot of people are going to pass on whatever they are offering. Them changing this seems very unlikely as this world-view of theirs is tightly knit together with their religion, which is also their number one tourist attraction. I don't see a future where they become any more relevant than the petro-state they are currently.
What? 2/3 of people are younger than 35??? How? What happened to the elderly? Oh...
oh yeah, living in the middle of the dessert sure is something Like some rich people said, they would not leave their home country just to save some bucks
One of the hottest places in the world, actively making the world and itself hotter and uninhabitable, wants to become a tourism hub.
I'm from Saudi Arabia.. and couldn't be more impressed with how well your presentation is delivered. I don't really have anything to add except for hoping for this seemingly impossible gamble to bear fruit. I guess whatever you do, whether you invest in other sectors or remain dependent on oil , you are making a gamble either way, might as well do your best and take a leap of faith. think i may start taking camel riding lessons , just in case 😮‍💨
electric cars are bad too, we need cities that are not car dependant.
Idiots...all that time to evolve...and nothing!! LAZY!
As an American, 3 Trillion is nothing. I wish we could get half of that for the Trillions of debt we have.
I think to attract more people, Saudi Arabia should liberalise. Oh, but that's too hard compared to building huge cities.
4:40 tanki online tank
Saudi Arabia owns Nintendo.
Lol idk if oils done. Flipside is it's going to more time to figure out issues with going electric like battery fires and stability in extreme weather, infrastructure upgrades to handle the loads, how to mitigare the environmental devastation this wreaks on most places where the materials for batteries are produced and from the standpoint of any country not aligned with China. What to do about the overwhelming majority of batteries made in, China? Cuz the CCP is comically evil. Like Saturday morning cartoon villain evil.
Bro I get your point about Saudi is trying to get away from oil but it is not because of electric cars as electricity is made by oil.
So long as it's sub $100 per barrel gas is cheap and the Saudis are pissed.
Feels like a 15min ad for SA.
best war thunder ad ever lol if i wasnt hooooked id be hooooked now
china build more coal power plant than the all of the contries
the line, the cube, and the rest of these projects are idiotic, unpractical, unsustainable, and they all look like dystopian hell
What's up with the hate? Most of the comments are happy and cheering for a failure? Many of you probably came to life when your mom ride a car that has probably Saudi oil.
Why did you hide the ad in the video, that is sinister, so as to avoid skipping, that'll make me skip the video.
😂 making electric cars have lots of exploits too and it is even more destructive for the planet to make electric cars than it is for making combustible cars .. oil is not everything , it takes the exploitation of lot of other components to make electric batteries .. which leads to the exploitation of humans too so this ain’t better … even if they were mass producing this new car functioning with water.. the planet would run out of purified water …. Humanity just wants to exploit and make money and this will cost the humanity itself
Electric cars have nothing to do with reducing oil reliance LOL
I'm a Saudi. And fun fact, we don't care about others prediction.
I love your stuff but going electric is not a realistic dream. If all UK cars, 32 million, were electric we would need 5 times the current annual global lithium production. No one is electricity anything to any signification level. Oil will be done when there's nothing left in the ground. Or if we move to 100% nuclear toothbrushes
How did you find the companies the fund invest to?
The other month here in America the EV's were struggling in the cold weather. Run the heater and the battery goes dead.
No graph supports your claim.  All those “alternative” energy’s sources require a baseload—oil.  Nobody’s pushing the nuclear power necessary to supply replacement baseload energy.  The environmentalists have been bought by Big Oil.  It’s going nowhere.  In 20 years, I want you to remember I said this.
Get a pop filter.
Saudi can't do a Norway
I don't see it happening for SA. They want to become a normal developed economy. When other countries do that they usually start with a lot of population growth and little money. They get foreign investment that helps grow and then try to educate their people. SA is in the opposite position. They have money but no workforce. We are dependent on their oil, but they are dependent on the world for almost everything else. Nobody else is going to invest in SA, they will put in their own money. But without a workforce their wont be a strong economy. And the megaprojects could very well fail and be a huge waste of money. A line city is so unpracticle I doubt whether anyone will live in it
I think you forgot that journalists found out that they actually try to make more states oil dependent for example they try to make many african states buy more oil by selling them cheap cars. Climate Town has a video summerizing the findings.
Oil is not a finite resource.   In the same way topsoil isn't a finite resource.
Ive also seen talk of the theory that they dont really have as much oil las they claim and thats the reason why theyve cut back on production and are in such a hurry to diversify into other things
Rahhh Saudi
yeah, No. all Electric vehicles is actually not to have EV cars, they know that its  impracticable meaning they do not want you to drive, and if you do drive they have a kill switch in the car meaning they can turn your car off anytime they want, you will not be leaving your mega city, They eventually want to replace cars with 15 minute dystopian cities. Gasoline cars = Freedom to travel anywhere you want. Crude oil is actually Renewable, It is a natural mineral that forms naturally through the carbon cycle, it is actually the most Green energy since burning it turns it into Oxygen, Hydrogen, Water vapor and Co2 which is what plants breath. Yes it does spew a pollutant called Carbon Monoxide which is CO, but this isn't a huge deal since CO breaks down into its base elements when in contact with UV light from the SUN.
I cant see myself going to "Saudi Arabia" for a holiday
finally
all those megaprojects are fucking insanely supid
They want 100 million tourists a year? That is 1/80 of the worlds entire population going there every year! No way that works out.
"In the year 2040 there wont be any oil left."  That i was told in 2000.  Just like that.. it suddenly is 60 years.. same with climate change.. only 10 years or.. Heard that fear mongering since i went to school. Actually thought back then that our world is already doomed today.. it still is here and has more forest than ever.. I feel like they use those narratives to push some sales.
You should be a comedian
There’s no point in making any more Electric vehicles as there will never be the infrastructure to keep them charged, they will not enjoy free road tax and they’re virtually uninsurable with the existing battery technology because of the cost of repair and spontaneous combustion.
i found the only thing lacking is the idea of peace in the region, the last 20 years alone has just been killing. fear of an oppressive state, and aggressive neighboring states is the biggest reason i wouldnt go to saudi
BS!   Not every cars  will be elctric, for example is Toyota about to launch an ammonia engine ...
"The line" is a quasi Chinese belt and road project.   Ittle never manifest as the horizontal city. But the foundation is being dug and the bottom layer of the line just so happened to be a 4 lane super railway from the coast to the international airport.   China wants mined minerals out of africa. It desperately dosnt want to boat them over the water because of international tensions. so they have been investing heavily in highways and railways to take it sll over land.   Saudi Arabia will make trillions in rent for this railway but they could never justify it as a train project and stuck the city concept ontop to sell it to the public.
I have 4 friends from Saudi Arabia that I met at a top 20 college in the US, they were all studying CS or Math/CS with a grant/stipend from the government and essentially a promise of a job at Saudi Aramco upon graduation. Honestly an awesome deal for them, Saudi gets skilled workers, they get to live out their golden years of youth in the US expenses paid, then return home to a basically guaranteed high paying job upon return to Saudi.
"OIL IS DIED" "ELECTRICITY IS FUEL" "CHINA IS FULL"
Really a bad time to change my name to Mohammed Ben Salman Al Saud.
0:22 nice sneaky Derrick Lewis insert lol
Great video!
It is always good to know how to pivot, and be innovative, so we don't become like Crow the oligarch, that tries to manipulate arms sales, by genocide, and to pad their stock market investments.
its this the 6th or 7th prediction of peak oil?
People don't believe these CGI renders if unsustainable cities... right?
The sooner we move off our fossil fuel dependency the better.
western economy will be dead without oil
Not the 1st time we've heard these exact words. GREAT prediction. Give us a timeline? Stay safe.
It's refreshing to see a leader with a long term plan for the country. I'd say the inability to have long term plans is one of democracy's biggest flaws. Not sure the shotgun approach is the right approach though since you're bound to lose money in at least some of your investments.They'll also really have to do something about their image before their tourism plans can take off.
Why not talk aboult the "turkish century" that the goverment here loves to shove down our throats every time we voice our discontent towards them?
0:14 I stopped beyond this point. “Experts” claimed we hit peak oil demand 3-4 years ago. Now the goal post is 4-6 years in the future.  I’m not going to entertain this shit.

That transition into the sponsor segment made me laugh so hard at 3 a.m my parents had to check on me.😂😂😂
They are really trying to sheikh things up.
Prop-A-gander.  The oil is NOT running out, it is MADE by the Earth.  The climate is NOT changing due to CO2.
Idiot: but what about EVs, just stop oil etc  People waking up . Yeah screw it.
📝 Summary of Key Points:  📌 Saudi Arabia, as one of the largest oil producers, is heavily dependent on oil for its economy, but oil demand is expected to peak in the 2030s. 🧐 To address the potential decline in oil demand, Saudi Arabia has launched Vision 2030, a plan to diversify the economy and reduce dependence on oil. 🚀 The plan includes investments in renewable energy projects, infrastructure, education, technology, and large-scale projects to attract tourists. 🚀 Saudi Arabia has established the Public Investment Fund (PIF) to finance these projects and reduce reliance on oil revenue. 🚀 Transitioning to a more diversified economy poses challenges, including redefining the social contract and developing highly skilled workers. 🚀 The success of Vision 2030 will depend on the ability to measure the effectiveness of investments and create new sources of income.  💡 Additional Insights and Observations:  💬 "The success of Vision 2030 will determine the country's future and its ability to adapt to a changing global energy landscape." 📊 Saudi Arabia has significant oil reserves and relies on oil for a large portion of its GDP, exports, and government revenue. 🌐 The video does not provide specific references or sources.  📣 Concluding Remarks:  Saudi Arabia recognizes the need to reduce its dependence on oil and is taking steps through Vision 2030 to diversify its economy. The success of this plan will be crucial for the country's future and its ability to adapt to a changing global energy landscape. However, challenges such as redefining the social contract and developing highly skilled workers need to be addressed for the plan to be effective. Generated using TalkBud
At the very least they’re not completely denying the problem. A lot of the tourist attractions seem like pretty shit ideas due to being to pricy and ineffective, but the idea to build more infrastructure, diversify the economy and focus on renewable stuff instead of oil is at least better then the other options.
Isn’t going all in on tourism still a bad decision? Take Sri Lanka for example
The whole world isnt calling to stop using oil. Only rich western countries. Theyre pulling the ladder up behind them so African countries cant get to the same level
2:49 it`s not just "Ukraine war",  it`s the war that Russia (!) started in Ukraine
Hope you got the bag off that ad
EU: *OIL IS DONE!* *collapses Rest of the world: *nah we're cool with oil*
Nothing will make me want to visit a religious fundamentalist country
Video: Oi is dead U.S.: Was that troll? Was that troll? Was that troll?
People have been talking about peak oil since the 1970's.
Dream on. Oil will be around for decades.😂
You know that saudi have Uranium, Gold and natural gas unused.
Tourists will be broke soon. They won't be going to Saudi Arabia for a vacation. They will be living in their tiny houses and trying to feed their families.    They won't need sports and fancy vacations but the world can't exist without oil.
I guess they tried to build their education system as well. I remember my high school chemistry teacher was offered a job in Saudi and he couldn't believe the amount of money they were willing to pay. Despite all that, he didn't want to leave India.  It's not so easy to attract intellectuals as it is to get labourers with cash. Educated folks will also want better lifestyle and social liberties.
4:32 "Let me tell you one reason why oil is so important. Defence." The war industry. War is profits for them.
Yeah the ev stuff isnt about saving the planet its all about control.
Spoiler alert: all these mega projects are a really bad idea
Nahhhhh, we have oil for another 500 years minimum. Don’t kid yourself!
Battery production is terrible for the environment
oh yeah , oil ? what do yo think the prime ingredient is used in making tyres ? without which no car moves !? and the plastics used everywhere in cars and just about every outher thing in our lives , all made from oil !  the fact that the U.S , the largest consumer of crude , has it's own mothballed stocks and simply is not buying from the middle east , the fact that terrorism against the U.S has been generated in this area funded by petrodollars so they have been hit in the wallet
Hardship breeds innovation with the right conditions. Geographical theories of development propose the idea that it was directly the result of the harsher conditions in the cold west that those populations came together to discover solutions, leading to a faster rate of development. If the Saudis can position themselves to solve the problems created by their desert nation, they might lead the world in things like water desalination, leading to a functional society.
not bad, not great. lots of un backed spurious assertions in here.
Canadian here, not true. That is all
wow , how out of touch can you be ? you hav'nt heard that EV sales have stagnated for the last 6 months ? that manufacturers are halting production till the unsold stocks have started to move ? that the people are refusing to buy something that 1: is a ticking timebomb , 2 have limited range 3 have recharge times rated in hours not minutes 4 governments are losing excise and levying special charges against EV owners 5 lose value faster than the time it took the titanic to sink  6 worth only scrap when the battery collapses
A few months ago, my firm sent me to Saudi Arabia for work. It's super affordable. My rent is $1700 USD and I am living in a fucking mansion with marble floors and high ceilings. I pay almost NOTHING in taxes. About 20% of my income goes towards bills and the rest of the 80% is to dick around with. I never thought I would ever afford a house keeper and a driver. I have so much disposable income... I swear I do not know what to do with it. So I am just sending it back home. I thought I would be the only white guy around, but there are many who came here for work too. So I am not feeling like a fish out of water.  And to top it all off, It is warm and sunny year round.   Screw what the media says about this place, it is fucking awesome.
the first 4 minutes tell me this guy read an article or two and has no idea what he's talking about...
Hmmm, what can drive tourists to a country, sites to see (oh except mecca and jeddah), ability to get drunk, maybe sex with my non married partner after a full day of seeing nothing who may or may not be the same gender...yeah nah.
Although countries may say they want to reach a goal of electrification in personal cars, that doesn't mean it will happen. 10 year-old me wrote an essay on why we need nuclear energy... how can politicians have less foresight than a 10 year old?
So..... oil isn't dead. Stupid video
Fantasy; the world runs on Oil; and there is much more of it than you may think. Go back to the 1970s where this garbage ideas started.
wow I have just heard 20 minutes of buthurt narrator talking about his dream world economy always will heavily depended on the oil till it is run out why? because alternatives are too expensive and not possible to maintain
Saudi Arabia can not produce oil at $4 a barrel, it's real cost is closer to $40.  The world has reached peak oil production, despite EIA estimates which I think will be revised downwards, I am not saying production is dropping I say we are at the peak and it will slowly decline in the future. The Saudi's have faked their numbers, sure they have oil but it the newer wells aren't as easy to put into production as past wells. It is vital that they keep the fake numbers in place and not revise down their capacity and reserves. Saudi Arabia needs stable oil prices both on the low end and on the high end. We all know what the impact of the low end would be, their cash would dwindle quickly. However, very high oil prices would collapse demand and shift future demand faster and lower than what they need to transition their economy. Will their transition work? I don't know but it is very critical to their future and they have to get the timing correct.
None of these ventures can beat simply drilling into the ground and getting black gold. There is only one destiny for this addiction with oil.
I believe that Japan just ummmm.. changed their mind on all EVs.
bro want to be singapore so bad
Pinnacle of luxury and entertainment but still ultra conservative and shut off from other's state of mind. You win some, you'll lose more.
At $38 coal liquefaction we are hundreds of years away from Peak Oil
Yeast can produce diesel. There problem solved.   EV are stupid beyond belief.   Renewables are not renewable.
Let Saudi take better care of the Asian workers to start with before they brag about big projects. It is disgusting how the "Muslim" people from Saudi exploit foreign Asian workers.
you thought you can escape the snail huh.
The title should've been "Saudi's Gamble to Prevent an *_Oil_* Out Collapse" instead, missed opportunity
Right now I give about a 0% and 0.00001% chance of this happening or having an impact.  85% of our energy use is fossil fuels currently and we use 114 million barrels of oil daily.  We are more likely to have a 10% shortage for oil demand which will drive the price well above $150 barrel crashing the global economy.  EVs are a side show as they currently exist keep in mind a barrel of oil gives you diesel, jet fuel, gasoline, tar, lubricants like and 10 other things. Saudi Arabia is trying to figure out what to do when they are out of oil not because demand is going away.
been there from 2018 to 2022 for study masters. as much as dystopian it is, with unlimited resources from aramco, whatever the plan seems achievable. but the issue was, my instinct said the plans was more like a bubble, it can pop anytime and vanish.  and regarding the tourism, i think you missed to mention that due to religion factor, they actually had an infinite back up of what we called „hajj“, a yearly pilgrimage that attracts at least 2 millions muslim (some said it goes up to 5 mio) during hajj sessions to visit the ka‘ba. while during the ramadan sessions, it approximately attracts half of the peak of the hajj session. so, saudi will still be standing in their ground, it just the matter of the way of choices, are they going to be „more conservative“ and stick with „islamic“ background, or as you can see nowadays, even bieber and blackpink can make a concert there….
The derpy camel XD
Hmmm.
Oil will never be dead
I just want to note the threat of the Saudi's having significantly more production capacity then they choose to operate may just be a lie. When Aramco was nationalized the estimates of the saudi's reserves suddenly rose significantly. Saudi Arabia loves to boost about it if it suits their geopolitical need but they've never actually boosted production as high as they claim they could and a lot of analyst think the Saudi's have inflated their reserves and in fact cannot follow throw on threats to flood the global market (with the 2020 price collapse having to do with a market glut yeah but also.. duh...)
A government foreseeing a problem and working to head it off decades in advance?  What sort of fantasy world is this!?  Edit: Who knows if it will work, but it is just odd they are trying.
A interesting video on the REALITIES OF oil politics. This is different from what I view as self-righteous, I grant activists like the Gretas or the ones who ruined the Mona Lisa, the move away from oil whenever that will be (and you point out it could be approaching), HAS consequences that any serious leader needs to contend with. Moving away from oil will disrupt nations that rely heavily on oil. That means as you say a societal/economic collapse. This isn’t something to happy about. Forget whether you think oil is bad or not (and it’s like any energy resource that is flexible), we have to contend with nations that are going to fight tooth and nail to avoid their downfall. It’s easy to be go on the streets write some posters and say “end oil.” It’s another when you get questioned on “hey what do we do about oil dependent countries who don’t have the means to adapt as well to a world that isn’t relied on oil.” What happens to say Venezuela’s economy? It LITERALLY needs to sell oil to survive as of today.
I love your uploads, keep them up bro
As a Saudi, all I can say is 🤷
Did anybody else pause at 2:04 and look for potassium or just me? 😂
This is nonsense. Despite decades of nay-sayers, oil production has been trending upward for a century. Technology will certainly make oil obsolete eventually, but that day will come far in the future, certain not before the dawn of the 22nd century.
Your national animals would make an awesome sticker collection!
I thought peak oil was in the 1980 during global ummm...(checks notes) cooling.
Actually Kazakhstan's Number 1 export is potassium.
All of these futuristic hypercities, yet no tourist reconstruction of Golden Age Baghdad?  I don't remember Venice becoming a tourist hotspot for its giant reflective desert cube or a line in the sand
Peak oil has been on the cards for a long time, I say nuclear will make electric cars make sense to a degree, green energy will never be able to provide base local but nuclear is how to ween off oil, also Japan has made nuclear fuel recycling breakthroughs that decrease the need to store spent fuel from many millennium down to a hundred or so years. Nuclear is it.
Better remove the shahada from the camel (for the sacredness of shahada)
Canada's new cars as of next year need to be Electric only.
hold up, oil and no corruption?
I knew this because saudia is now trying mordernize the state by allowing tourism
Oil has at least fifty years yet to power our planet. Without it, our planet would stop and half the population would starve. Oil and all it's by-products like fertilizers are essential.  So rant on about oil collapsing, but no statistic is supporting the collapse of oil. There are plenty of stats about the collapse of EV demand. Why not rant about that?
Peak oil is a lie. Always was
Oil isn't going away any time soon
Saudi should invest and transit to becoming a global power-house on solar powered data centres and AI technologies.   They have an abundance of sunlight and land that is not suitable for much else.
who will tell him that oil was from animals thaat lived millions of years and left after them more that 60years left oil ... we dont even scratch surface
many people are commenting oil in not going anywhere/ oil will rise forever/ I am hearing oil pick forever,🤦🏻‍♂️ but actually the fact is in 2022 first time green energy becomes cheaper than bio fules and when battery price and ev price will decrease in 2026 green energy will be accessible to mass and oil industry will be bankrupt. And there are already alternate for every oil products 🤷🏻‍♂️, alternative for oil grease is Vegetable oil-based greases: These greases are made from vegetable oils such as canola, soybean, and sunflower oil. They offer excellent lubrication properties and are biodegradable. 🎉🎉✌🏻
They abuse Filipino people like myself in that country!.!.  That’s one of the reasons why I don’t want to visit that country!.!.  The concept of Human Rights doesn’t exist in that country!.!.

convince E-girls to party in Saudi so OnlyFans can be crushed
50% of its citizens are "working" government jobs and you think they are ready to create a "private sector"????  Dream on!!!   Not going to innovate for a generation or two....
I think a problem that may arise is as the government tries to attract tourists, it will inevitably try to liberalize to do so. This liberalization moves away from the strict fundamental principles of Islam, and together with the plan to try and push the citizens into actual work, may cause a lot of resentment. They have to change to stop relying on oil, but this very change could spark some serious unrest within the country.
I was in Saudi Arabia last year, I don't know if they can pull it off. I did buy the outfit though and rock it frequently here in the states.
I remember hearing in the news that oil reserves were depleted since I was a kid! YouTube loser guru=fake news!
Won't go near the place until they start having actual social rights.  None of this hijab nonsense or any of the rest of this religion over people's lives.  The US is bad enough with this but the Saudis are far worse (and from what I've heard, a lot more hypocritical about it - they do things in secret because it can't be done in the open).  The rest of this is just window dressing.
The Gulf states are legit living on borrowed time
Missed the opportunity to say 'Oil out collapse'
That transition into the war thunder ad was god tier. I almost felt bad when I skipped it…almost.
lol, the Arabs are fucked. At least terrorists will have less money. 😅
it seems like they looked at Norway's economy, said let's copy them but snorted 10 lines before they got to work
What if Saudi Arabia is branding themselves right now to be that crazy country with all the weird asinine sh* everywhere 😂
Why don't you post more often? You have very good content and I'm sure if you took the time and energy to do so you would earn a ton of revenue. Thumbs up if you think Hoser should post more often!👍👍👍👍👍👍
as a person who lives a few miles Abqaiq your pronunciation caused me physical pain.
Important question for Saudi tourism: after skiing on an indoor mountain in the middle of the desert, can I end my day with a cold beer? The answer to that will significantly influence how many Western tourists would be willing to holiday in Saudi Arabia.
Hmmm, explains why no one talks shit about the government there. Half of the citizens work for the government. TIL.
just ship Indians back and live a simple life,what can be wrong?
By 2035 maybe only 10% cars will be EV.
Fantastic content, just wanted to say that I really appreciate you citing your sources
Saudi has been ranting about diverging their economy from oil pumping since 1960s, they didn't achieve anything.  Who knows a country that operates on Sharia law is not compatible with the modern world?
The title made America sad 😭 💀🤚
Airplanes, long haul freight, long haul freight trains, ocean transport, farm equipment, mining equipment don’t have non fossil fuel alternatives, it ain’t going anywhere

Why did you use a buffalo to represent the US?   The US's national animal is the Bald Eagle.
The only way this cooked plan could ever work is if it comes with free market and political reform (democracy). I will never as a western tourist visit their theme park cities under shari'ah law.
Hi H0ser ❤
Theme parks hum..... I can see Saudi Arabia becoming the worlds Florida.
Not going to happen...
20 min video? u spoil us hoser
We will find new sources of oil. We will not find new sources of lithium. Forget electric cars - we will just have to walk.
Only thing I cant agree with in the video is the comments saying the mega projects are cool. They all are just rich play toys at the end of the day. The coolest buildings have purpose!   Great video as always!
any word on the Houthis attacks....
I feel like this is all a scam perpetuated to benefit western consulting firms.
this is the same story since the 70s. Oxygen will run out before oil runs out.
They should stay away from video games
Money can only buy so much .  If other  countries  get to be the most innovative, the first choice  for people  too work and study.   Government  and freedoms  have big part off that
I'll pass on Saudi Arabia, thank you.  Maybe one day if there's Liberty, a big cultural change, they drop the police State they have, stop killing the enviroment, have civilized levels of racism, stop building useless gigantic crap, one can have a glass of wine while watching women walking around... and the current delirious and murderous king abdicates. I could go on.
Lol this channel has to be paid to slander KSA at this point 😂
what would it take for me to go to saudi arabia? them getting some basic human rights and not using slavery for most of their projects. so that's never going to happen.

Culture > economy or government. Governments and economies are a product of culutures. Cultures also take generations to change. Until SA can change their culture to be more secular and internationally integrated, there's zero change people will want to move there or really have any mutually beneficial interests in it.
I got to Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Dubai frequently for work. What I have found is how incredibly vulnerable they all are. Cashed up, undereducated with no understanding of the western world. The money they spend or invest is often squandered. They are ripped off regularly for certain countries. They love the feeling of entering a room and dropping cash on the table but they dont understand what they are buying, how long it will last or whether its a good investment. Its really sad.
lol no one wants to move to Canada. That authoritarian shithole.
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

Hoser is that a hint at 0:33 for an episode on morocco!?
seems like they just invested in the most moronic VC-infested industries
I can't imagine how rebranding itself as a luxury destination will improve their economy... especially if they are trying to attract a working class...
I love hoser!
half of this just seems like Saudi govt propaganda lmafo
Saudi arabia needs human rights lol not a gaudy vegas clone
It's interesting that you use a bison as the national amblem of America since Americans shot them to the brink of extinction to cut the food source of native americans.
i'm surprised you didn't touch on the Jeddah Tower scandal lol
The real question is, why is Venezuela so bad at capitalizing on their potential oil wealth?
More likely electric cars are dead than oil.
We are not Kazakhstanis. We are just Kazakhs. Kazakhstani is reserved for Russians that live in Kazakh Republic. Kazakhstan is Persian name that Russia popularised during soviet times.  We call our country “Qazaq Eli” (Қазақ Елі). Great stuff as always Hoser.
Mom come quick hoser just dropped a new video
They say we're going to run out of oil in 50 years, every 20 years. Which is it? Make up your minds.
"Oil is done." 18 seconds later "Obviously we'll never be done with oil."
I'm afraid some of those dumb islamic fanatical knuckleheads will see all of these modernization and REVOLT against "Western influences." This might result in revolution, terrorism and a total backlash against all the progress being made.  You heard it here first, folks. So please give credit to yours truly, Lương Đỗ. 🙃😉😁
When they allow people to go to church on Sunday and women to vote then maybe I'll think of it as a tourist destination until then screw them
They are paying 200,0000000. (2 hundreds mill😊) dollars yearly for Ronaldo (the soccer player). Wow. 😮
Yall dumb oil ain’t going no where
You have no idea what you are talking about.  EVs have already started to decline.
Canada shares so many similarities with Australia
Well if oil is dead Biden will not come to Saudi Arabia to begs mbs 4 some😃
It took all of 7 seconds to spew out "Peek Oil" like it's 1972

Oil Barons and Jewish bankers aside, even if you start building nuclear reactors or make more fuel-efficient cars, electric cars suck ok, they are a waste of time and money, you do more pollution in building one then than you do driving a truck in a year, cruise ship and power plant that use fossil fuels are worse that one car, you're still going to need oil, it's not that there won't be a demand in the future for oil, not at all other will be a very large one at that, but it will a more cost-effective demand,
i actually have no issue with saudi, it's great to see a prosperous kingdom in the modern era, as many have been tragically wiped out by the usa and england in recent times. i would go there in a heartbeat once their policy about women and queer people changes for the better. at least for travellers. i'm not asking for a lot, just a simple, live and let live, would be enough to feel secure as a tourist.
I read the title as "Saudis Gamble to Prevent an All Out Collapse" and was very interested. reading it the correct way I don't think I'm gonna watch this video :/

Nice video
Pif would be better off buying gold. Wait, isn't that what got maummar done in?
Saudi should invest in space elevator before too late. Gundam 00 serve good reminder.
It won't work. What they need is human capital, they can only rent it while they have oil money. When thqt dries up, all the borrowed human capital will leave. Then the desert will reclaim saudi arabia.
They should concentrate on turning the landscape green.
Peak oil demand will not be had until 2050, all of Africa, most of Asia and all of South America are trying to industrialize and fast. EVs aren’t shaping up to be anything that it was thought to be as the secondary car market is terrible and disastrous. Oil is used as the chief ingredient in every single piece of plastic, in cosmetics, and in energy. Germany is brining oil and gas power plants back online because they shut their nuclear plants. Saudi Arabia is at 92% of its refining capacity and is currently working to install more refining capacity.   AND this is not to mention that the US needs to refill its strategic petroleum reserve, and that’s hundreds of millions of barrels that need to be bought and brought on shore. All of this not also including the fact that there is no other commodity out there that has the same properties as oil, cheap to transport, does not give off flammable gases, easy to transport, a liquid at room temperature and can be refined in a version of fractional distillation to the point that people can do it from home. There is nothing else that works the same way for energy. Porsche has already invested in alternative recycled fuels and that’s going rather successfully. I wouldn’t be surprised if we end up closing the cycle on crude refinement so that it becomes a near closed loop from production to waste as technology advances.   Auto companies have already signed the death of EVs, with Toyota and BMW now both switching to massive technological investments in Hydrogen. Truly, the most abundant element in the universe is the future of fuels.   AND lets not also include the fact that nothing drives demand like war, war turns the global economy because war turns the US economy. All of that oil is worthless until it can get from where it’s extracted to where its demanded. Yemen has shown that nobody can keep the sea lanes open except for the US. The petrodollar is the reason why the rest of the world gets their oil and gas. America lets the oil flow and everyone else benefits.
Ask an EV owner if they know how electricity is made. we will laugh together in another plane
Fun fact, did you know that Just stop oil is a fake movement paid by an oil tycoon in order to make green movements look stupid?
Like the Maldives, I refuse to travel to an Islamic state no matter how much they spend to try to lure us in with tourist sites. They rely on slave-like labor by foreigners, are oppressive to women, don't allow non-Islamic religious expression in public, etc. I refuse to support this. Even if they somewhat loosen restrictions, they need to completely remove Islamic influence in government (good luck with that). Since I mentioned the Maldives and someone might question why, they notoriously do not allow someone to be a citizen unless they are a Muslim (if you are a citizen and convert to something else, you will lose your citizenship) and have similar restrictions to their citizens as Saudi Arabia, they can just hide it by allowing tourists to do things citizens can't do.
peak oil is a myth
China is actually not investing money in renewables they say they are when they're actually building thousands of coal burning generators.  China air is unbelievably polluted and it will stay that way for ever. They have crossed the Rubicon. It's all over for them.
Hey this sounds really good for the Saudis, diversifying the economy letting women work being more environmentally friendly and privatizing jobs that's so good like sure they're not Democratic but at least they don't pretend to be Democratic *cough* *cough* people's Democratic Republic of Korea 🇰🇵 *cough* cough*.  But in all seriousness i hope this does help the people of Saudi Arabia. Who knows maybe it will spread to the rest of the middle east🙂
When I went to school, peak oil was supposed to be in the 2000´s....
Just saw a ad of saudi golf courses. Sounds fitting for a literal desert
The Mukaab, Trojena, Qiddiya and The Line are like something that would fit in a sci-fi dystopian world, but at the least they have some kind of plans.
norway has a population of 5 million and a soverign wealth fund of 1.5 trillion, last year norway's wealth fund generated a total of 143 billion enough to give every man women and child 30k usd each.  saudi arabia just need to figure out how to build a sovereign wealth fund of 3.5 trillion...either by selling aramco and saving a couple more years till the fund reaches 3.5 trillion....and then hiring norways managers to run the fund, 3.5 trillion is enough to give everyone in saudi arabia $10k usd a year...not too bad for a country of 20k Gdp per cap.
lol sorry to burst anyones bubble but oil isn't going anywhere most of the green energy projects on the planet are nothing but corporate greenwashing and dependent on structural grid support from coal, natural gas and nuclear  most green energy projects in the US are biomass which is just burning trees lmao  the least amount of energy is actually supplied by solar and wind and the maintenance of that infrastructure isn't too green either in the long run  the main problem with oil won't be a demand issue but a supply issue once it actually runs out
Since when is the US a Buffalo?
The only thing that is done is the European economy.
Mabye just spend some of it on education
Sort of weird that a country which is basically in Africa could host the asian games.
Golden as usual 👌
they are trying.. EV car sales are stalling.... electricity still has to be generated.. renewables arent there yet.. changes in solar regulations in cali are going to stall solar electricity generation...   and what would you consider natural gas?  Japan relies on Nuclear energy?   Will the US shift to Nuclear......  airplanes will use jet A for a very long time..   you might have to revisit your position on oil  at the end of the year....or after the next US election...
The long twilight of fossil fuels (BTW maybe not as long as some think) is going to be fascinating to watch as it unfolds. I wish I could be around to see the whole thing. I may have a fair number of years left, but it won't be that many. In fact, demand will probably not be really close to zero in any foreseeable time frame. As demand keeps dropping, it could keep gettng cheaper to produce the little bit that is still needed, creating a fairly solid and stable floor.
Nah, personally I can absolutely see them becoming the Venezuela of the future. Oil is a curse more than it is a blessing and you need the stars to align for everything to turn out alright.
Oil will only die when you can charge your car in 5 minutes
bro dropped the zer0?
america doesnt need oil from the middle east and america is actually the global leader in oil exports. what happens in the middle east doesnt affect americans. or at least theres no reason it should. theres nothing but oil and hate that comes from any part of the middle east
Oh, c'mon...MBS couldn't even get his 1km "my d**k is huuuuuge!" tower anywhere near completion. The "Lyin'" just consists of various bulldozers randomly moving crap. And the "cube" is just...geez, a hotel with no outside views. And this is supposed to work HOW, exactly?  I mean, sure...you can use money to buy all sorts of things. But these projects are clearly the work of con artists and raving lunatics. How, exactly, WILL a 400m cube make life better for the Saudi people...the selfsame people that the House of Saud fears, which is the actual reason for the money-flinging and goofy projects. The minute that money STOPS flowing is when the bloodshed STARTS...and they know this.  Now, imagine how much the world's economy would benefit if MBS did the sane, rational, and RESPONSIBLE thing of channeling their funds through sensible investing programs, bond issues, and the like. Could be pretty cool...but as I noted above, this isn't about responsibility, it's about d**k size.  And you don't even need to wait for everything to go all to hell! The Janky Tower is already an awesome backdrop for a reading of Shelley's "Ozymandias"! So...tourism!  Right. Tourism. Saudi Arabia. MBS can expect tons of...oh, who am I fooling here? Vacay in a place that kills people for what they choose to do behind closed doors? Yyyyyeah... There's NO liquor, NO drugs, NO partying, NO NONONNNNO! They should just rename the place "No Fun Here".  Still don't believe me? OK, let's talk about the most dystopian vacation spot of all: Mecca.  Not going to dog the religion here, so you can chill and put the sharp objects away. No, I'm more concerned about how the country operates the place. For example, it's very commonplace during the Hajj for large masses of people to die for no sensible reason. Could infrastructure improvements and rescaling help? SURE! So what did MBS do?  Oh, nooooo...he gave Mecca a clock. A very, very big clock, with a hotel from which you can LOOK DOWN ON THE KAABA...does anyone notice a problem there? Hmm? Is there some overarching reason why it looks like something out of a comic book? Looking DOWN on the holiest site in Islam?  Optics, dude. Optics. Bad optics there. Lots of bad optics. Chopping peoples' heads off in public? Bad optics. Only allowing women to drive after being shamed by the rest of the planet? Bad optics. Developing utterly unfeasible nonsense on the old Roman "bread and Circuses" model? Bad optics. Paying what amounts to a bribe to the Islamic sect that can't stand you? Bad optics. And the list of philosophical eyesores just keeps on rollin', just like the heads in "Chop-Chop Square". Nothing like several dozen public executions a month to let civilization know that you're modernizing!  The actuality, though, is that if the Saudi people could ever get their hands on MBS, you'd have to get something more effective than a spoon to clean up the mess. And therein lies the crux of WHY all of this money is getting flung around like Mardi Gras beads on Fat Tuesday. Yep... it's ALSO a bribe. An "insurance" bribe, to be more exact. And those are NEVER a good sign. Once again...bad optics.
finally some of the money will return to circulation from their pockets. doubt we will notice any difference anyway lmao
I remember a video done by Caspienreport where he talks about the Arabian-Nubian shield, a large area of Precambrian rock which contains large reserves of valuable minerals like gold and silver, as well as critical strategic metals such as cobalt, tantalum, and niobium. A large portion of this shield is located in the western part of Saudi Arabia. I imagine the Saudi's are going to look into mining opportunities in this area as a potential source of revenue in the near future as they attempt to transition away from a mostly oil-based economy.
Oil is great, we just shouldn't burn it !
I've been hearing this since the 1970s.  Oil is going to be around a lot longer than people think.
China recently opened FIVE new COAL plants. Why do you guys never mention this, the truth? A pledge is not truth.
Wtf happened to hosers voice
Idiots and barbars.
Nooo, my dead dinosaur juice!!!
The dromedary is cute
Saudi Arabia is perfectly analogous to a lottery winner.
Where does he get those cool rectangular export/import -charts? Been looking for them on the web but can't find them, so pls help.
Good that dude needs to be humbled
The biggest worry for Saudi Arabia in the last 10 years was the U.S. shale revolution. Many people don't know this but America now produces more oil and natural gas than it consumes, we just need to upgrade our refineries to process the kind of oil we produce. Pretty soon, Saudis will have no influence over U.S. economy, and this comes at a time when Iran is only a few years away from developing a nuclear weapon and has countless proxies in the region that oppose Saudi Arabia
I will bet every penny I have that those goals will not be met by 2035 lol

"Saudi" is an adjective. The noun version of it is "Saud." Saud is the royal family/house that rules that part of Arabia. "Saudi" isn't a place. It isn't a person, It isn't a thing. It isn't even an abstraction. It is an adjective. Stop using it as a noun. "Saudi Made" isn't the same type of phrase as "Made in China." It is the same type of phrase as "American Made."
Yeah peak oil Just like theyve been screeching for a century now Glad you actually took the intelligent path of pointing out that it is limited and all nations seeing the consequences to the instability in the middle east will be shifting away from it more
Saudi Arabia, Russia, and every oil interest is trying to end the world.
Spoiler: this whole time, @h0ser has been a Saudi-funded AI experiment
Dang thats tough... for people in a few generations. Now, we live the v8 life
Why would anyone want to live in or do business in SA? It's hot, dry and extremely conservative.
Yeah… “peak oil”is like cold fusion and we are always a couple of decades away from the event.  Believe it when we start adopting PRACTICAL alternative sources like nuclear.  Solar and wind are not broadly applicable geographically (solar panels in Germany, etc) and storage for peak load efficiency in electricity usage is not yet available.
7:52 That's literally a dystopian Futuristic city prison for Saudi  to lock up 9 million of it's people and then , you can guess what going to happen ...
2:04. Sorry but this chart is inaccurate. It does not show potassium as being a large export, but Kazakhstan is #1 exporter of potassium. All other countries have inferior potassium.
Don't Saudi Arabia just found a tone of gold including other mineral resources? Like copper, iron and aluminum. Please keep in mind that Saudi Arabia doesn't only export oil.
im at 3min so idk the rest but it feel like saudi will probly make all the money they need from oil by 2030-2050
im sorry but the line is the stupidest idea imaginable
Venezuela was overly dependent on oil, and look at them now
Its far too much emphasis on high end lifestyle that cant exist withou oil. The world without  oil simply wont have such a large population of wealth and the extra pleasure money that comes with it. Whie elephant on steroids
I’ll believe it when the elite stop flying private everyday
3:20 That's the real issue , Saudi Arabia until now had a big welfare for most of the population , cheap food , free electricity , cheap oil , etc . All that going to end with Saudi Arabia 2030 Plan !
OPEC's mascot animal is very apt.
0:35 Fact Check Debunk !  No Japan didn't say that all new cars will be electric ! It said will be Not oil , meaning a Biofuel , Hydrogen , etc  🙄🙄
Hey Hoser I heard that there’s economic crisis going on in China right now but I’m not too sure have any recent video or any video recommendations for it? And good video
they should really invest into more societally important things like education and universities, and trying to get a lot of foreign students and such, and trying to use some of the oil money for stimulating start ups and such, if even just in the form of venture loans
Fuck electricity. Bring me back to the 90s where I can have loud cars and jdm drifting around
It's funny how everyone has a phd on managing economy online like it is that easy 😂  Do you have any idea how many advisors and talents comes with billions of dollars and do you really think they would just throw money into vanity projects without objectives?
Oil will become a product only for military uses as of course they will get first go at whats left. We will not transition to renewables on the scale of what oil runs, we will end upnwith a personal power and fuel consumption of the forties. It just cant be replicated with todays technology
Oh man they're investing in esports lmao
Lmao, the exports of Saudi Arabia are wild! 70% Crude, yes, but also everything else I can read until Raw Aluminum is also petroleum derived. A good 90% of their exports are oil products lol
Guys, can anybody here help me answers this question. From my knowledge, Saudi Arabia doesn’t just sell oil and spend the petroldollar, but it also invests in companies and stock and put the money in world wide banks, so it doesn’t rely entirely on oil, but I have heard this is also unreliable. I’m kinda dumb on economics, so can someone tell me why is that the case?
So because of Capitalism Saudi Arabia is changing or bending some of its Religious laws ? Interesting.
Instead the demand for oil will increase...
the King is an idiot hes like elon musk  but even dumber  if you snort dino poop for a living  no wander you want to build weird cubes lines and spheres with "techno bullshit" written on them in the fucking desert
Honestly, that's pretty cool!! I hope they make it, move on, and turn into a better society over all. Shame that ☪️ancer is way ✝️oo strong. But I think they may be able to do it.
If this is pulled of it would be insane
Oil… is still needed for plastic…
The western countries are trying to break free of oil to cut of revenue to Russia.iran. Venezuela etc who have under ground seas of oil but the western countries don't want to deal with them
My dream is one day hoser will talk about my country Malaysia
lets gooo fuck oil! amd fuck rent seeking behavior!
I hope their dreams come true. However, as pointed out, there needs to be a huge shift in society, namely the House of Suad releasing much more of its grip on it society. Something I believe they are completely unable to do, at least to the extent that's needed. Plus, it takes just one successor to undo the whole plan.
I believe we will use oil for as long as we use plastic, or Vaseline. Edit: Wait…. Lucid is SAUDI!? What the hell! Thought it was American. Edit 2: They’re American, Saudi Arabia just has majority stake.
Ok but it's Persian Gulf not Arabian gulf
that transition into war thunder was smooth i laughed. had to 2nd guess myself for a second there.
Didn't know Lucid was owned by the Saudi gov't; do they offer a "Bonesaw" trim level on their cars?
If we would get into the deep manufacturing of electric powered tech then oil really is still important
Investing in energy infrastructure? Good. Investing in technology? Good. Investing in hundred billion dollar bullshit projects in a desperate bid to attract tourists? Unwise.
It is stil just an big infertile plot of earth you cant hope to build an sustainable nation with the same living standards as in europe in arabia they shold use that money and influence to return to the golden age of Islam unite and diversifi and stop building tourist traps but actual cities for people
Don't you think further industrialization of Africa, South America, and Asia might spur more demand for oil? Other forms of energy have high fixed startup costs. Cost-benefit analysis will be in favor of oil in these environments for years to come
At least they are trying to diversify the economy 😂
2:04 Where's potassium? It's even in their national anthem, after all.
This is what happened to Nigeria in the 90's we fell victim to the oil curse🙇🏾💔..... I can't recall the year or what disagreement the usa had with the arabs but that situation led to the usa exporting alot of oil from Africa but most importantly Nigeria  Eventually the USA settled the disagreement with the arabs nd within five years they started exporting less oil from Nigeria which pulled alot of Value out of the economy add corruption nd bad leadership boom here we are today 🤷‍♀️🤝
if saudi arabia really wants tourists they are going to have to stop offing people for no reason
W/Re tourism, I wonder if they plan on relaxing their persecutory laws that are currently hurting that tourism. Like, even if I wanted to visit Saudi Arabia right now, my existence is literally illegal there, so therefore they, through their own laws, cannot earn tourism money from me. This goes for any other LGBTA people, and somewhat so for women.
10:10 If you want to see what problems can happen in a company when given infinite money... just look at the tech industry. After 2020, interest rates were dropped heavily, so you basically could get free money. The tech industry took to this heavily since they often focus on growth to improve stock prices. And they made large acquisitions with that money. And... they almost universally fired off tons of employees the instant money stopped being free. They inflate stock prices with the 'appearance' of growth without any real consideration if any of that actually made any money for them.
"Oil is DONE"  7 seconds later: "Obviously we will never be done with oil..."
Saudi Arabia is trying to build a new economy like I build cities in Cities Skylines
The style of your video and the way you talk is so irritating. Just be normal dude. Your videos are polluting my page.
They are building NEOM city and that will bring 300 Billion Dallars every year from Tourism and AI powered manufacturing. Many white people are working on that project so it will be very succesful. The whole world wants to live in NEOM
Oil is dead is a real stupid statement that puts in focus the speaker’s ignorance and wishful thinking. But hey go off
brooo really sold me on war thunder
Just a matter of time until they import the NFL there. They do with the biggest boxing events already
War Thunder has a Saudi Arabian bias.
wouldnt it make more sense to try and follow an example such as norway, a country that is arguably the only petrostate to escape the curse? obviously tons of differences between the two countries, but kind of seems like it would be a better idea than what saudi arabia currently has planned
Theyve been predicting peak oil in the next 5 years for the last 60 years.
Hello
I don't agree with the statement that Saudis are addicted to oil and therefore they are in a problem if in the future oil will decline.  Up until a 100 years ago the tribes occupieing the arabian peninsula had nothing to do with oil, and the only reson they have became aware of its value is because industrialised westerners showed interest in it and therefore putting it up for sale. From there on the unified tribes that would later form modern Saudi Arabia and especially the ruling class invested the money wisely as would any Arab sheikh do buy purchasing golden vehicles and building golden palaces with beautiful golden woman and a magnificent golden horse and a golden sword, not necessarily in that order. The Saudis are not addicted to oil, they are addicted to pre industrial desert culture. No amounts of money can save them from collapse when oil declines, only education and cultural progression will save them. It is unfortunate to say that besides them using modern technology and speaking English the entire social structure is still based on who has the most bling as opposed to actual knowledge or skills.
I couldn't even consider visiting KSA let alone moving there until they start respecting human rights.  (i don't want to get executed upon stepping into RUH)
Ad transition smoother than a babys bottom
woah
It’s funny western channels will call Saudi ideas ridiculous when the idea that oil will somehow be replaced within this century is at least twice as ridiculous
Hope it works out for them, I do enjoy seeing rich people actually investing and trying to improve stuff instead of just sitting on their dragon's hoard of more money than any one of us will ever see in our lifetimes and trying to wring a few more pennies out of us.
End of an era
I looked at Kazakhstan's exports.   I didn't see potassium.
Oil is far from done don't kid yourself.
The Just Stop Oil activists get their money from oil heirs, their website domain is shared with Exxon. So, unfortunately, they also will not be too happy to realize that their top contributors will stop donating, very sad.
lol the renewable energy products are made by oil.
snail caught me again
More than 70% of their exports depend on their oil. All of the chemical industry (pink) is a very "oil-intensive" sector. They use oil as a raw material and/or energy supply.
So basicly, Saudi Arabia is screwed.
Fuck warthundet
Every motor and bearing has oil and grease in it even electric
Thank you hoser ❤

"Muh peak oil"
Fun fact: My great grandfather was one of the oil workers that was there when the deal between the US and Saudi were constructed. The prince at the time gave them all special camel whips (that we have), where when you pull out the whip part, a blade is underneath.  I now also have the camera that took the photo of the very first oil gush in Saudi (and no we did not get a penny of that wealth he made LOL)
"Years of fossil fuel reserves left, 2020" by Our World in Data Less than 60 years of oil left on the planet at the current burn rate. Less than 50 years of natural gas. And 139 years of coal.
With the expending the dividends of the funds well that’s how Norway got it right , so yeah unless the world crashes into a massive 3rd world war they would do fine
They literally live in a desert, that’s like the second place to become uninhabitable in years to come.
They're hoping to build world class facilities, events and experiences run by under-educated, privileged people. They've lived a comfortable life for decades and haven't spent that money on building their education system. Complete opposite to countries like Norway or Singapore which invests their wealth on their people and livelihoods.
cringe
babe wake up hoser uploaded
they said we would hit peak oil 20 years ago.
It will take a century for Saudi Arabia to turn a culture that hasn't valued hard work and entrepreneurship for basically ever into a productive, innovative workforce. It's literally impossible without two generations dying off first. To get it done in a century, they will need to import scientists, engineers, and technologists from other areas, paying them handsomely to move to the desert. This means they will be recruiting people in droves from Europe, the US, and East Asia. And this will completely change the culture. SA will secularize and democratize, and the home of Mecca and Medina will slowly but surely lose interest in Islam. To prevent this the imams will go full-blown jihad. The country will be torn apart and the House of Saud will eventually lose its grip on power. I see a very dismal future for SA in a low-demand-for-oil world. It's a complete catch-22. If they are successful, they destroy the country. If they fail, the country dies out.
They have too much money, they need to find a way to cut back on the extra comfy lives they spoil their citizens with.  Why will someone bother with getting an education if they don't need one to get a job? Or hell, if they don't need a job in the first place.  There isn't much "brain" to "drain".
Babe wake up new hoser vid just dropped
dune reference. addiction to spice
They still beheading journalists tho?
Saudi setting oil money on fire rather than fixing the climate problem its helping create.
As a woman, I will never step foot in Saudi Arabia. I will not go somewhere where I’m only given basic human dignity because they want my western tourist dollars. I don’t give a rat’s ass how much progress Saudi is pretending to make.
Honestly, I don't think oil will be dead, it's still the cheapest option for the middle class and the poor. Do you know how much renewable technology cost? I tried to see how much it will cost me to have solar energy and oh boy it's expensive AF. I understand that Europe is trying to switch to renewable energy, but a lot of countries are not, so even with that there will still be a huge market for Saudi Arabia to sell to. Maybe by 2100 we will be over oil but by 2030 I highly doubt that.
Saudi Arabia is playing simcity and converting from a oil specialty city to a tourist specialty city.
1:00 LOL 😂 12:00 The Saudis are investigating inti everything. 13:40 Very interesting response from the Saudi crown prince.
SA also needs to be more women friendly imo… 99% of the time it’s the wives who decide vacation destinations 😅
I love you hoser!! 😍😘
2:45 why would you write in white on a yellow backgroud? Come on, dude, just write in black
this will all backfire big time and one day SA will be a state ran by religious extremists like iran. the pundulum is forced to swing hard one way then hard the other way.
30 seconds into your video and already two things that are complete bs

Quite literally “going for broke”
I think its kinda ridiclous to assume that tourism can be the next big industry or Saudi Arabia when laws are so hostile to Women, LGBTQ people, and those who do not practice Islam. For anyone to go to Saudi Arabia for tourism it must be safe for a lot of them.
Peak oil is right now imo
"OPEC cartel" Love this ^
Somaliland and somala have more oil and gas than the entire golf states.
hearing all this hope for saudi arabia of all places makes me feel like maybe the world does have a chance

4:23 I could make a joke about the Saudi’s gambling, but I won’t.
Video about Kazakhstan by any chance?
Bruh, who the fuck wants to go vacation in Saudi Arabia? Literally almost anywhere else is a better choice
its impossible to stop using oil, but a lot of people want to basically make it so that places like saudi arabia cant control their economies, especially considering the fact that saudi arabia has funded many many terrorist acts against said countries attempting to distance themselves
The reason Saudi Arabia is screwed on longterm oil profits isn't even just because of renewables. It's also because the cartel power of OPEC has been massively diminished. The reason they historically have been able to set prices is because OPEC would pull back production to raise prices, or pump extra to lower prices and drive competition out of business. They can't do this anymore though because there are major producers like the USA and Canada that aren't in OPEC, and countries like Russia that are technically in OPEC+ are selling as much as they can for uh, other reasons.

What makes Saudi Arabia a rentier economy? I googled it and I'm a little confused. It says that Rentier capitalism is the economic practice of gaining large profits without contributing to society. Is Mohammed bin Salman the person collecting the money and then distributing it?
I still think oil will certainly a critical resource, We still need it for plastics and many other different products, Whether or not it's used less and less as a fuel source depends on how affordable and efficient EV Cars are and that the resources for the cars themselves can even be secured, such as massive amounts of cobalt needed for lithium, Besides thanks to the Shale Revolution we can turn rock into Oil and America itself can drill for oil in it's own backyard(we just have retarded """Green""" policies getting in the way)And if anything we all despise the eco-nazis and their relentless push to break entire economies for the sake of their feelings and grotesquely inflated egos, I say drill baby drill but in our own backyard, not the Saudi's.
as an owner of a lucid it is a really good car.
you forgot to mention corruption
At least the line will make a cool cod 25 map  !
Oh but they still kill gays. Just can't stop that I guess.
I didn't know Bin Salman spoke English so well.  Now I can insult him in a way he understands.
I can't believe we are still paying for their lavish lifestyle and boondoggle projects. With global warming on the rise it won't be long before the region will be unlivable and people start migrating north. They should spend the money on housing and infrastructure in Europe to house the droves of people that will inevitably come.
sponsor transition smooth as hellll

Why don't you talk about US/Canadas problems?????

THIS is where I get my news from
Almost like putting most or all of your eggs in one basket is bad Kinda funny they have to give up some of their Islamic laws in order to progress.
Saudi Arabia will fail badly
This also demonstrates how cancerous blatant capitalism really is. Saudi wants to erase whatever culture they have left and turn the entire country into a giant theme park in order to keep those dollars flowing. No sane civilization will come from this.
Whos to say that oil is going away so fast? Yes we see more electric vehicles but still they are exempt from taxes and we will need to rebuild the grid only to transition to private vehicles what about trucks And heavy machinery ? What with all the petroleum based products as you said?  Most of the efforts today are to faze out coal and gaz. If developing markets in asia and africa will grow the demand will grow? Can we be sure that oil is dying in the coming decades I think that more than all Iben Salman tries to sement hes rule by being an asset to the west and projecting power internationaly and nationaly
the line city genuinly baffles me, cities spawl outwards in all directions for a reason, spread 2 points randomly on a shape, a circle will be most likely to have the shortest distance, ease of access is important for a city, you don't want a firestation every few miles you want one fire station which can travel miles, you'll need way more infrastructure just to support a quirky impractical city.
1:23 bro says saudi arabia and shows dubais pic
7:04 They should invest in human rights  I'm sure more people would be willing to go if you didn't have to ask yourself if your own existence isn't a death penalty the moment you come out of the plane in this country
Its crazy how the Saudis wont do something reasonable to boost their economy like...end slavery under the Kaffalah(Sp?) system.  All they really need to do to boost GDP significantly is require workers to be paid a reasonable but still not good wage (being dirt poor would be a significant increase in standard of living atm) and place a cap on remittances that can be sent home. This would make those workers suddenly have expendable income to use in the economy, that they of course would then use. And once the money starts flowing, the GDP starts growing, and everything follows from there. Workers would start gaining money which would drive women to enter the country since there are now men with stable incomes looking for wives. Those women would also work and they would start families together. Industries would pop up overnight to support those sectors. They wouldnt even have to offer them citizenship so they could maintain the unequal society status, while simultaneously having a much larger manpower pool to draw from for military and other reasons.
what I don't understand is how they're supposed to attract so many tourists as a very religious muslim country
"Oil is dead and we have killed him"
Thanks hoser for continuing to make fascinating geopolitical and economic videos about certain places in the world. High school is exhausting and you really help me out with it so thank you ❤❤
Meanwhile the climate change be like : Haha....... NO.
Unfortunately for Saudi Arabia, there is room for only so many Dubais. And my guess is that the long-term global demand for Dubais in the Middle East is less than 1.
Sorry but we aren't going to ditch oil. >China is investing a lot into green energy Sorry but no, this is a smoke screen. The amount of carbon emissions from fossil fuels has been going up exponentially in China. They spend billions to try to make it look like they are green. Look up China Fact Chasers "China Doesn't give a Crap About the Environment!" and Serpentza "China is painting Mountains Green to fool Environmentalists - No, Really"  As for electric vehicles, you have to charge them. Where does that charge come from? Well from the natural gas, coal, and oil power plants of course.  The fact is until we start mass adoption of Nuclear energy then we are not going to deprive ourselves as a species of the most efficient energy source.
Bro oil WILL never die as long as its used to GENERATE electricity.
we have way more oil than whatever they say we have on earth artificial scarcity is the name of the oil game we also will not have full ev cars until 2200 atleast
You are absolutely wrong. Many sports are already top down and corrupt. The saudis are shakings things up in some areas and people are getting hyped. Ofc that and the money. Can't have any of it without the money
Sir, a new hoser video just dropped
Hoser: “oil is DONE”  U.S. military: “it is done when I say it is done”
Maybe they could sell solar power
peak oil is 10 years away, just as it was 10 years ago, and 10 years before that, and 10 years before that
"My grandfather rode a camel, my father rode a camel, I ride a Mercedes, my son rides a Land Rover, and my grandson is going to ride a Land Rover…but my great-grandson is going to have to ride a camel again." ~ Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum
What do i care about a big stupid tower as a tourist
Saudí Arabia is going to have to get rid of creationism and become like Iran 🇮🇷 and teach evolution in class
Oil is finite but we will never run out of it as we are finding new reserves faster than we are exploiting the known ones
Never have I got this many ads on this short of a video, why did I get five ad sections (10 ads??) you’re trying to make oil money with this video my boy
Dubai is just a fake paradise for the rich to hide from the problems they caused, but I wonder what it will be like in the future when they can't really sell oil anymore
The money they are trying to put aside for those mega projects like the line, mahgreb and the giant tower could be used to kickstart other industries like more intensive agriculture, paying liveable wages to the people building infrastructure and the kind of arduous but necessary step of creating training colleges and universities to start building up an educated work force.  They're wasting money and more importantly time and resources on mega projects and gimmicks that will never provide a sustainable economy. AI, ski resorts and even more car dependence isn't going to claw the Saudi's out of the hole they've dug, it will just push them further into it. MBS is just another mad tyrant that's going to drag as many people down into hell with him as he can, and honestly than can be said about a lot of 'world leaders' of recent times. Looking at you DT and Scroto.
4:44 NO NO NO NO NO NO THE SNAIL CAN'T KEEP DOING THIS, IT'S FOLLOWING ME EVERYWHERE AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
Kinda sad that saudi never even tried to industrialized
Becoming water barons is probably a good move looking at how winter is going here in Canada this year. Nestle boguht up all the water here so Saudi might be the only nok corporate entity exporting it when USA and China start getting thirsty.
Branding is even more powerful than that, the U.S. is a sometimes  corrupt nation with the majority of citizens not able to afford healthcare and most don’t protest. China is extremely   Corrupt and oppressive nation and has awful working conditions and yet third world nations and their own citizens idealize their government.
This was already known 20 years ago, nothing new. The rich in the middle east have been pumping a lot of their investments into industries outside fossil fuel for decades.
Ngl this is the first time I have ever heard mbs speak, not how I imagined he would sound like tbh
when you want copium and your largest provider is saudi arabia
Best tourist attraction to make: GOOD ART EVERYWHERE. Theme parks. Race tracks with rental super cars. Natural wonder parks. State of the art casinos that entertain more than suck your wallet dry. Concerts... Epic olympic competitions and sports. Ok, well they do have the gaming cube for esports, so that's good.   Yet they are sitting there twiddling their thumbs with: City, but BIG line. Towers, but BIG and TALL. SNOW in the desert. POOP TRAIN. ISLAND but in the shape of EARTH and BIG. ISLAND but in the shape of a PALM tree?? Arabian toilet. Slave labor...
can you do an episode on el Salvador or Yemen?
MY GUY CAN COOK! What an interesting vid! I even slipped into the ad segway without skipping. Pls don't leave youtube like the rest :,) <3
Oil isn’t going anywhere. How foolish you have to be to think we will actually all be driving electric cars in 10 years. California can’t even keep its energy grid from shutting down as it is. Let alone host millions of electric vehicles charging off of it.
17:41 great video, but there was a slight mistake , the average Saudi is more educated than the average Canadian and Gabonese according to the graph not the other way around
But that's good. I am all for them diversifying their economy.
CLICK BAIT!!!
DUDE, WE DON'T NEED A HUNDRED YEAR HISTORY AS PUTIN'S 30 MINUTE, GET TO THE POINT!!!
For my dislike of the Saudi, as a Middle Easterner, I do hope they succeed. The last thing we need in this region is a major country collapsing.  I mean imagine if the Gulf Monarchies suddenly collapsed, aside from all the trillions of dollars lost in in investment and assets, any smblence of stability and security would disappear, millions would become refugees, all the immigrants would lose their jobs and may not even be able to leave, and forget Hajj immigration since we would be back to the days of bandits and unsafe roads.  The truth is that the next few years of the Middle East's history will be its most important. If any more collapses happen it would tisk putting the entire region into jeopardy. Syria(my home country) collapsing was practically enough to a severe crisis, now imagine if Egypt or Iran collapsed.  That's why despite my hatred of Turkey, Iran, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and (somewhat) Israel's governments, I don't want them to collapse entirely since it would plunge the entire region into a state of anarchy. (Also sorry for bad grammar, simce English is not my first language)
will YT show this comment ? it been deleting all my comments
I am curious on how well attracting tourists is going.
gold reserve mining makkah territory.desert agriculture ,large solar panel.oil refinery,sea aquaculture export
Honestly… I really hope these projects fail. Like… instead of doing anything remotely logical they‘re just trying to bribe anyone (from citizens to foreign officials (looking at you FIFA etc.) to tourists). The mega projects won‘t work. So if they spend a trillion on NEOM that‘s fine. That‘s lost money. But if they manage to get away with continuing to be a shithole (civil liberties, law & order, …) I‘m really pissed. They‘re disregarding human rights, fund terrorist organizations left and right and try to make up for it by buying sports events from countries where people actually watch / attend them. No one wants to atrend a soccer match in the middle of a dessert. A soccer doesn‘t even have a history in the middle east. No oke attends these matches. But they‘re buying them to get some attention. They don‘t care that the people who actually care about these sports don‘t live in the Middle East and that they‘re ruining the entire event. It‘s a quick attention grab.
Let's be realistic: Oil has so many technical and economic advantages, as long as there is oil in the ground, we will not stop drilling and using it for idelogical reasons. That assumption is absurd. The world will keep on consuming oil til there is no more left that can be drilled below $100/barrel.
Can't wait for Saudi to be a self-sufficient country post-oil while the US is still having a homeless and migrants crisis
Allow for immigration, assist assimilation, & grant business loans. ,
Saudi’s need to focus on selling oil to poorer nations that can’t afford ‘green’ energy.
Finally a new video, heads up hoser 🙌💪
Wake up babe, h0ser uploaded a new video
I don't know if Mohammad Bone-Sawman will be able to pull any of this off before climate change makes Saudi Arabia unlivable.
We’ve been saying that we’ll hit peak oil for many years now. It’s not going to happen for a long time. Everyone likes to say that renewables are the future, but anyone who does the math knows it’s not viable. The only viable alternative we have right now is nuclear, and for some reason they are trying to kill it.   My theory for that reason is because large companies are going to squeeze as much oil out of the Middle East, and as much money out of pushing renewables until both wells run dry. Then they’re going to ramp up the prices of oil produced in Canada and Alaska, turning Canada and America incredibly rich. If they mushed nuclear, they would push an actual alternative to oil, and remove most of the need for oil and gas.  That’s just my crackpot conspiracy theory though.
The solution to having too much money is to spend it on stupid crap. No one is going to go to a desert paradise except social media influencers, and movie producers. The reality is, Saudi Arabia has nothing to offer most westerners, except oil, and that is enough. I think your assessment of the EV future is a bit early. There is no way in hell any country will fully be EV in 10 years, without massive subsidies, and even if they do, those EV's require massive amounts of oil and rare earth elements to make, so oil demand will stay high, even in a state subsidized EV world.
Yeah. Saudi is never gonan be what they say thwy are. People find it cruel whag they do.
What is this? An ad for Saudis?
Has colleges or higher education enter the chat?!?!? I'm guess not
I think it's ironic that Saudi Arabia is trying so hard to get tourists to come, and yet if I were to visit I'd be killed for being openly queer.   Hard to paint yourself as a welcoming place with those kinds of laws.
i am not going to that religious extremist  homophobic backwards place that discriminate LGB people, ever
Saudi in the private sector and gotta say, this is spot on. We're doomed because we're dependent on oil, foreign labor, and the people fear and follow the monarch (as close to worship as any one can get).  Whats funny about it, things are becoming more expensive and wages are stagnant, I'd genuinely move to another country and discard my nationality if I could.
It's persian golf. Not Arabian golf. I don't think it's appropriate to spread misinformation ;)
Why would i wanna visit a country that exploits slave labor and women are 2nd class citizens?
h0ser, could you please, on future videos, explain more on the huge effect that stopping using oil would bring to the third world contries, as in mine, Brazil? People make oil look like it is just making the planet worse, while in reality billions depend on it indirectely to have affordable food, fuel, medicine, etc. Basically while first world countries would only have a little worse standard of living, some countries would have huge portions of its society sinking in poverty.
It would also help Saudi Arabia immensely to dial back on the Islam.
Hoser you got paid by a prince to do this ad? you should disclose this in the description mate.......
Saudi Arabia should invest in Dota 2 items
Can't just Saudi invest in Bangladesh, Indonesia, Pakistan,  Financial sector & factories  These countries are emerging economis(maybe Pakistan Isn't)  Pro Saudi for last 1200 years  And gives saudis More leverage
Yeeeees Colombian Condor!!
Oil isn't really dead, though. Global mining capacity is comically short of what's needed for the EV transition, and oil is used in damn near every industry in existence as an input. It's still gonna matter for a long time, even if it isn't used quite as extensively.
Oil isnt dead as long as weapons exist oil will outlast humanity 😂
... oil is a technically renewable resource, not finite ...   Also, calling China a 'superpower' renders the term meaningless.
did we just fix climate change by that? jk, its complicated
11:10 *Edit* Wrong-Time :L Alottta US Companies, *Awesome Video!*
Peak oil? Really? Do you know how long they have been pushing that idea?  Mining equipment uses oil, so as long as they are despoilng the world with lithium pits,  they will need oil to do it.
Great, infinite ads and infinite commence censorship where I can’t even praise the videos on your channel.  Unsubbed, reported
nice video
YOU PUT TOO MANY ADDS IN YOUR VIDEOS
Whatever we say about Saudi prince, we can't say, that he lacks vision and ambitions.
hmm, so they are actually trying a sensible strategy. huh. Good.
One thing to note though, the PGA/LIV golf tour merger hasn't gone through yet and the fact that it hasn't means it might break up soon
An Islamic country will never be a place where people want to go.
I think we are already beyond peak oil
TANKI ONLINE TANK WITH SAUDIA ARABIA PAINT who would have known that tanki online would be mentioned-
People say that we will use less oil since the 1970s but the demand just keeps growing anyway, i think none of us will live to see the end of oil extraction.
Yeah probably the same thing those that want to say face will buy it through proxy so no one will get there hands dirty with that dirty dirty oil just to guess though
you are literally the worst apologist on the internet and everyone with a critical mind knows this.
I may not like the Saudi government due to all the human rights violations, but I honestly respect the effort.
Do a video about egypt
Haha, hahahaha. Clickbait. :D
I feel like they can just put their money into a huge hedge fund and live forever off the interest
"What do you need to make tourists leave their bubble and come to you"  Human rights? Wait, this is Saudi Arabia lol
derpy saudi camel is 11/10
BRICS is selling to themselves, and are also the largest buyers of energy in the world. BRICS countries also own 44% of all the worlds energy as well. If Saudi Arabia can replace the US markets like Russia did, they'll cut off the entire west and BRICS has made this very clear that that is their goal. All of BRICS will do this. "Just act like you've been sanctioned because next week you might be." They're not waiting for that. Not just oil either, all the energy markets from Uranium on down. Russia is now building Nuclear Power reactors in Africa, to people who presently don't have electricity at all. From nothing, to nuclear power. This will help Niger find new markets for their Uranium and throw France out completely. Which they've already done. This progression of BRICS is not stoppable and will only accelerate. It's only a matter of logistics and they have an additional 34 nations lined up to join. That's how well it worked for Russia. If the Chinese can replace the US markets, China will be gone as well. The world is getting rid of us, our dollars, and our queer men. GET USED TO IT. Not too long ago the US was energy self sufficient, will that ever happen again? I highly doubt it. Trump or no Trump.
Peak oil has been said for as long as I have lived which is over 3 decades. Yet, we have not done what the French have done use and recycle Nuclear energy. (Yes you can recycle Nuclear waste, yes France runs 75% of their grid on it)
Can I say in Saudi Arabia that I don't want to belive in Islam no more will the people stone me there . Are there any churches since there is about 2 milion christian foreners???😊😊😊
can you please do economy of jamaica
POV: you dont undestand that there are other oils that arent crude oil that we could work with right? imagine being "woke" and not even being educated on bio-plastics... this videos premise was shaky from the start and good riddance to the gulf monarchies. bunch of de facto oil barons that have no problem staffing their refineries with slave labor.
Peak oil is nonsense. Abiotic oil generation is where most oil comes from.   Elite just want control, which is obvious.   Also, China is not a superpower, and you’d have to be a fool to suggest otherwise.
The Saudis will be reduced to depending on religious tourism to the holy cities as their main source of income. And that's assuming the infrastructure doesn't collapse with the oil money.
Politics are pretty complicated but when you see it from the right angle everything suddenly makes sense.
Didn't Canada made all drugs legal and isn't most of Canada's population right next to the US border and Didn't Canada's prime Minister gone black face all but 1 of these are pretty bad
Saudi is the living proof that money isn't all, and that wealth must be a consequence and not a cause. To me it will be a miracle if Saudi survived the bottom of their oil reserve. But I'll be a bit pessimistic: MBS need to progressively put an end to the rent, you don't work because you like that and even less for your country, you work to avoid poverty. Eventually, troubles will arise in a near futur. That's the same for their army: it might surprise some but to be attracted to become a private, you must have not a lot to lose, if you are making 10k a month, there is little chance you'll take the risk, if you want travels and adventure (which is a great point to attract youth in the rank), you'll just pay exotic resorts and activities... or play video games.
picnic table hats
total supposition.
I feel like, you are wrong. But we’ll see, I think that oil will not go away, even in cars, military vehicles, asphalt, synthetic rubber, ect.   Probably shouldn’t put all your bets in on “renewable,” but instead put your bets on Nuclear, and safer fracking.  This is a presumption from a guy who just dabbles in geopolitics, so don’t quote me on this 😂
"Peak oil" been hearing that for quite a while and i'm only 24...
To contrast the Saudi Arabian sovereign wealth fund to Norway's, mostly the funds are held in other countries in Norway, and there aren't the huge vanity projects that Saudi's indulge in.  And unlike in Norway, there isn't the likelihood that those foreign holdings by Norway will get moved to elites fleeing the country when it goes into collapse.
Nuclear is the cleanest energy.  If the world is leading to EV, we need to produce a ton of energy.  We cannot achieve this increase with solar or wind because it will fluctuate based on climate, rain, snow, etc.  We need a reliable source of engergy plant, we can do this with fossil fuel plants or nuclear.  Of course there are a few other sources like geothermal energy but not all countries have this or not enough to produce the amount of energy.
You fun. 😂. Oil will never be done. Western oil is done.
Honestly? This sounds amazing.   They're promoting free business, lessening their dependence on oil, diversifying their economy, promoting environmentally sustainable energy practices, and encouraging growth in virtually all sectors---the healthcare and education is particularly exciting.   I anticipate a Saudi Renaissance if this all goes through.   Wishing for the best. Now all they have to figure out is democracy...
of course oil is definitely "dead". this is DEFINITELY not a clickbait video
.....WELL, .......THEY'RE ABOUT MORE AFRAID THAT OIL WILL RUN DRY THAN ANYTHING ELSE, THO.......  ........BY THE WAY, IT'S KIND OF JACK POT ABOUT IF SOMEONE'S DEVELOPING SOMETHING THAT WOULD ATTRACT ATTENTION OF THEIR INVESTMENTS SO LET THEM BE LIKE THAT, HEHE
Ceausescu 2.0.
There's certainly something earnest behind this effort -- it's a tad late granted, but better late than too late -- and l genuinely wish Saudi Arabia the best in their transition, but while the other city projects have at least some semblance of sense and purpose behind them, the Line is just way too gimmicky and impractical for its own good IMHO.
The new editing style/graphics are fire just so yk
We have Japan with Zaibatsus that are big corporations that are influential in Japanaese society  Then we have South Korea with Chaebols that are mega corporations that basically control the country  Then we Saudi Arabia with one person controlling the country  If the suicide rate for people is higher ( and double for women) in Korea than that of Japan, then how dystopian will the Saudis be
With all these deserts, I think Saudi Arabia should've rather invested to become the center of solar-wind and hydrogen center if the world. After all, who lives in those deserts?
Now that saudi arabia joined BRICS, the only economy fucked is the US😂
I know lots of tourists go to Saudi Arabia because they're Muslims and that's where there big black box is, but if you're not a Muslim going to see the big black box, why the FUCK would anybody want to go to Saudi Arabia as a tourist? Gee, visit a country where there's no alcohol at all and all the women have to cover themselves in black tarps from head to toe? Sign me up! 🤦‍♂
It's a good economic plan. But a terrible social one that could turn into a civil w ar against wahhabists and other extreme reactionary movements.
Saudi Arabia has lots of land. It should use its immense wealth to terraform the Saudi Peninsula so that they can become self-sufficient in growing its owns food. Terraforming its land to create oasis everywhere. Saudi Arabia is pretty much the center of the world.
I'm sorry I can't believe information from a guy that takes ccp propaganda seriously
make a video about morroco
Is anybody here from Saudi Arabia??? Do you people have like elections of parties and like media freedom to say whatever you want???
Saudi Arabia:  -Has holiest site in islam within its borders.   -Builds a giant clocktower/hotel right next to it
"Decades" is the key. We are likely to run out of oil, regardless of extraction tech, in the next half century, so it's not just an option to distance yourself
Adamsomething fans about to write 10 000 word paragraphs of why they will fail (I would too but I'm lazy)
I used to pray for times like this (New Hoser)
The 2034 world cup hasn't bedn confirmed to be in Saudi but if we're being honest it probably will be 💲💲💲
Global oil demand hit a new all time high this year.  That's even with half the world not having access to immediate energy. Oil is going nowhere. $150 oil is inevitable.
i dont get it why will the world stop using oil just becasue of climate change  i get moving off oil to cripple the saudis but this planet has way more oil than we has found
As the film crude awakening points out, the largest oil field in Saudi is mostly pumping water.  The fact they moved to offshore drilling which costs a LOT more shows onshore is running dry.
"We're having disastrous weather events constantly"  "Yeah but don't you want this sick ass gigantic truck so everyone can know how cool you are on your commute to work?"
Let’s be realistic. These are desert countries with NO resources other than oil. No one wants to live in a desert and any attempt to turn that desert into an agricultural paradise, or build cities ‘for finance’, or tech hubs, will cost more than it produces.  The Saudis are possibly the laziest people on the planet, with cushy jobs assigned for life at birth, and a literal slave economy of desperate immigrants to service their every need. They don’t create anything, they don’t innovate. They use their oil wealth to pay foreigners for everything, from cleaning their homes to designing and building their vanity skyscrapers.  The end of oil cannot come soon enough.
Phd in yapping
Forget who said it but some Saud said something like "our grandfathers lived in tents and if we aren't careful our grandchildren will too"
I'm sad that I'm old enough that I won't see Saudi Arabia follow the trajectory of South Africa from prosperous but grossly unequal society to failed state.  Sigh.
I hope they're also investing in photovoltaics, seeing how they have plenty of useless land and more than enough sun. Exporting electricity and green H2 could be the successor to exporting oil. As for crazy scycrapers, winter games and linear cities with a hyperloop for a backbone... well... no. Just no.
The Line will be cool to explore once its abandoned
17:36 I am not sure if this is just a joke thast didn't land, or you're simlpy misinformed.  Saudi Arabia tertiary educational attainment for the 25-64 age group rate is higher than France, Finland, Germany, Denmark etc...  Not to mention enrollment in tertiary is also higher than these countries AND the US and UK.
I'd NEVER move to canada, it's a dictator led woke hellhole 😂😂😂 Truckers still in jail 2 years later for peaceful protests, bank accounts stolen 😂😂
0:
If you're gonna make geopolitical content like this at least use a map with the correct name for the Persian Gulf. It has always been the Persian Gulf and nothing will change that.
You know this will fail because when you have so much money and think you can fix your problems by spending money....well just look at America. Saudi Arabia can't invest on their citizens because the more educated they get the more rights they want and the more issues the citizens have with a criminal dictator king.
Saudi Arabia is like a trust fund kid who just came into a load of Money
Saudis seem like the only ones in the area that are aware of this coming issue and are planning for it. I hope they're successful. A stable KSA leads to a more stable middle east and thats good for everyone.
Click bait   OIL rules
Arabs are not skillfull or generally high iq people and the government knows that and thats the reason they are investing like absolute maniacs because without oil and western influence they would be still living like 18th century people.
13:02 The world learned nothing from Qatar
How about saudi manually do actual real labor? Money is nothing without labor
It could boost tourism to ditch the inhumane tratment of anybody not fitting their narrow worldview... Not that they have to in any way, but I dont see myself ever visiting SA if there is no change of those outdated and bigoted views.
Good, oil countries are so  dependant on oil that everything else is faulting. No innovation to speak of
The problem with attracting foreigners is the repressive muslim culture and living in a hot desert as the world is getting even hotter. Good luck with that.
They always move the goalpost for "peak oil."
The Line is contesting for being the dumbest thing ever.
They lie about their reserves though.
Can you believe it guys? The Total Collapse of the Saudi State, just a week away. The Total Collapse of the Saudi State is in a week! Woohoo! I am so happy about this information. The Total Collapse of the Saudi State! Just a week away, oh wow. Can you believe it? The Total Collapse of the Saudi State! Just in a week! It got here so fast! The Total Collapse of the Saudi State! Just a week away!
Yea, that's not the umpteenth time "peak oil" has been predicted. Demand for oil will continue to increase for energy and materials. Everything is made from oil.
Insert fallout. We’re fucked. At least there will be a show before
To me, oil is too precious to burn in an engine. It has too many crucial uses and alternatives for this burning in engine use case are too many to be still doing this until today.  Humans living 1000 years from now will resent us for having been too greedy and evil to deplete this resource for just being lazy.
Turtles 🐢
Funny goofy Camel.... Such a good representing symbol. 😂 Now they want to invest in African sweat shops projects in Tunisia as a solution.
Clarkson : Bwhaaa ! "Wheezed" Time to break out your camels. May : Its back to carpet for you.. Joke aside, No matter 50 years 100 years from now we still need oil. Freight train, Airline, Military, Ocean transport. Oil will never be replaced unless we have 2x2 metre fusion reactor.
Unsustainable economic system where nothing is produced as added value, just resources are extracted and sold.Implosion of biblical proportions Is expected on oil single asset economies.
the saudi production number is a little mislesding since in the case of the saudis their budget runs on oil and the break even for the saudi budget is above $50 per barrel
The tourism gambit is pretty silly to me when they run a government as oppressive is theirs. no amount of dumb megaprojects are going to attract people over thier concern for thier safety
If they have no steam trains I won’t go!
Okay but why the tank in the AD say 'click-bait'....
These megaprojects will become amazing movie sets. Either for a post-apocalipse or a paradise tipe of scenario
I just met a Saudi at the gym
Tiberium is the answer! Sure it can impale your lungs or turn you into disgusting yellow slime but it can grow almost everywhere.
The transition from hydrocarbons will be quicker in the west than elsewhere and confer a cost advantage. All l see in SA is mega projects as the future. It won’t work
I am not most of us, I am dying to go to Saudi, Saudi may be the best country on earth.
Saving us from the harsh reality of the chiefs winning :( bless you hoser
There is no gamble, Saudi Arabia is already doomed. They can invest billions into education but that doesn't mean overnight people are all of a sudden just educated. Their vision is impossible by the time US and Europe reach a critical percentage in renewables and electric vehicles. Their highest paying buyers will import less and they will have to compete with Iran, Russia, and Venezuela in importing to the 2nd and 3rd world.
$3.2 trillion isn't bad.  America spent $2 trillion in Afghanistan and has nothing to show for it.
theyre going all in on america's patented late-stage capitalism. which makes me think their dependence on oil is a lot longer to come.
the way I did a double take when h0ser chose to use a Tanki Online png for tanks at 4:40
I think the longer vids are better personally so I think it's a good idea
The Line is (pardon my language) a fucking stupid project. There's a reason cities have always been built upward and outward. Linearly is neither organic nor efficient.
Hi ! I'm a Moroccan and would like to see episode on my country !
Onces the Oil runs out and their waste of money on stupid projects, they will be poor again
Volocopter isn't even a saudi company, it's a german one, I bet all of these other companies are also foreign companies and the strategies of the Saudis is to just buy up all the good ideas (or what the Saudis think are good ideas), instead of coming up with any by themselves.
Tbf though, oil ain’t going anywhere and will still be used in centuries/millennia as it’s not just used to power cars like you’ve forgotten about all the other oils, greases and lubricants that have no ‘clean’ alternative whatsoever.
Please make a video like this for Uganda, Liberia and Central African Republic
After oil runs out we are kinda screwed. OK green energy, that technology is also based on fossil fuel, and the only thing that those technologies can do is reduce petrol consumption.
The more I think about it, the more the Arabs seem like the Mongols of the hot desert climates.
Actually you are wrong. It turns out that the U.S. has the lergest reserves of both oil and natural gas and it is estimated that there is enough for several hundred years so stop with the nonesense. Saudi Arabia is at the moment concerned with the price of oil and how long its reserves will last.
I’m glad Kazakhstan is mentioned. I feel like the organization of Turkish states deserves a video.
Weird info about allowing women to drive in Saudi Arabia, before the order, the authority jailed most of the women activists who were fighting for women's right since 1990.
Saudi Arabia needs to go Norway in government so they can escape their fate similar to Venezuela
8:00 SA thinking 100M people would come to see a linear city when France and Spain only got 75 millions as Number 1 and 2 tourist destination with every historical and geographical features they have, lol
And don’t forget their absolutely stupid football investments which are just losing billions without any hope of actually bringing in any money.
No money in the world would ever make me want to visit a Saudi-run country.
could you do a video on e-residency please 🙏 🙏
Anyone remember that Saudi Prince who was deep into cocaine trafficking? (Might have been a sign of things to come. Watch out what you wish for.) While we're on the subject of memory. Does anyone recall what happened in Iran when the Shah of Iran started giving money to the poor. There was a large population of young people and some old geezer. Does anyone recall what happened next? And where are they today? Unless Saudi Arabia divorces it's shotgun wedding to Wahhabism, trying to make the desert kingdom anything other than a mecca for religious intolerance, is going to fail spectacularly. Tourists are not gong to flock to a country where the women can't drive a car, electric or otherwise. And where morality police spy on people, beat them up, arrest them and ( We have heard.) rape them. Not cool. No one's going there. To survive; SA has to do more than a superficial change in make up, in appearance. It will need more than reforms. Remember Gorbachevs reforms? How did that turn out? It will need systemic change all at once. Out with the old and in with the new. In order to win over the support of the young people it will need to give them the one thing money can't buy, Freedoms! Maybe then the Saud family can count on the support of a tax paying population. If they're successful, the Saud's will be, in two hundred years, like Great Britain's royal family. Call Vegas and place your bets today. (If I were them I would be turning the desert into the worlds grocery store. Good luck.)
Saudi's have a 15% VAT on some of the stuff that you  buy
The thing is oil isn't about just fuel but numerous other oil derivates that come from it, so if you cut the fuel use out of it, there's still going to be need for it
Thats the persian golf you bigot🤨
what happened to ur india video at this point it seems like the mandela affect
3:11 it's much MORE than 70%! Most of what can I read off this chart is materials synthesized from petroleum. Polymers, alcohols, etc...
MBS needs to be worried. They could end up like Venezuela. A decline in the use of oil is a HUGE threat to the Royal Family. Far greater than anything Iran could do to them.
Hoser is the bomb. Saudi:Vision 2030 GOP: Project 2025 Rest of the world: Meh....nope! 😅
If the KSA hopes to make non-Hajj tourism a substantial durable part of its economy, it would have to return to the more cosmopolitan days of before the 1979 Mecca Siege. But that would piss off the Wahabbist clerics who legitimize the Saudi family, and compel the medieval social enforcement that has made the Kingdom infamously dissuasive to visit. Very few outsiders want to come to the KSA for other than faith or paychecks.

But, but what replaces oil ?   wind? solar? nucleary? hydrogen? human blood?  Tell me!!! where to  g̶a̶m̶b̶l̶e̶  invest .!!? Damn you!!
Basically, Saudi Arabia is going for the UAE strat, but they don't realize that the reason it worked for the UAE is that they started early
Fucking misguided. Best way to improve tourism? Reform government laws for jailing foreigners, liberalize society, remove theocratic laws, better design the cities around urban transport, improve softpower with interesting cultural exports, stop foreigner worker slavery *cough* indentured servitude by creating a proper immigrantion system.... then Westerns wont fear coming to a destitute wasteland built on human suffering and exhaustingly disgusting opulence.
That ad had such a good transition
Ultra religious, autocratic petrol state is the definition of an golden cage for its citizens. It will be interesting to see if they manage open up or will it just turn into a regular cage as the money dries up.
No business is easy like oil.
Has your voice changed? Lol. Interesting. What do you think about oil prospects in the Eastern Mediterranean?
I was literally playing war thunder while watching this video.
to be fair, the us is trying to do an over 10 year plan to gradually rely less on oil in the span of one presidency, we aren't doing it well
Glad to hear he got that war thunder sponsor.
I dont think we will use less oil in the future. I think we will TRY to use less oil in the future. But as oil becomes more and more scarce, the demand will keep increasing in a world that fails to transition into using other sources of energy
dude firstly your videos are insane and i watch all of them but sometimes you SHOUT too much while trying to emphasize something important and it makes my ears hurt, but when i turn the volume down i cant hear you talking. Can you lower the max volume threshold of your videos please?
They are just way to regarded to leave the desert huh?  I wonder if it's because they are all inbred?  As we've learned from the Chinese, it doesn't matter how rich the west makes you if your own culture is garbage.  They will collapse because of their own cultural rot no matter how rich we make them.
Plot twist: the oil is actually infinite, and they're doing this all for nothing.
i still remember when this channel had less than 100k subs.
Ah yes, the new "peak oil" scare that for sure right this time (in a decade.) Ignore that claims of peak oil have been wrong for the last 60 years. This time you can trust them, totally.  And you can totally expect all cars in Europe to become electric, despite us not even having enough cobalt production in the world for 1/4th of the US to switch over to electric cars.
Investing in tourism is weird. It of course is profitable market but in some sense its just like oil it is finite resource and is influenced by random events.
have uever watched its always sunny in philadelphia they us the word ''hoser''sometimes
I assure you, oil consumption may not end until the end of time. fossil fuel is the life blood that keeps the global economy alive. in the short run even as some big economies move away from oil, other developing economies will replace them. in the long run ( 30+ ) the whole process of procuring goods and services may be reliant on higher technologies than we currently have, therefore we literally cannot tell what will happen in the long run.  one thing although is for sure, the end of oil as an energy source is not happening anytime soon, on a global scale.
One the biggest problems with saudi arabia is that their citizens were spoonfed by the governemnt for decades thanks to the oil money and they "threw" money at forigeners to work in their country with no chance of settling down and the hardworking forginers had to leave (by force) thus enfocring the idea that there is no "future" in saudi arabia and you eventually will have to leave behind the country even if you may have been born into it ensuruing people of skill remaining away from the country, This leaves the country with the saudi citizens who were paid to simply exist and had great pride (which some may even call arrogance) in them and thinking themselves as superior to the "exparts" from 3rd world countries making them very entitled and lazy so it is no wonder the saudi governemnt is in panic because they clearly cant expect their citizens to change thier lifestyle of extravegnce like a spoiled brat.
They've been saying we're going to hit peak oil for decades. It's not logical--the world runs on oil. There is nothing taking it's place. EVs? Nobody wants them and they have too many problems. Solar panels? Wind? Where are the technologies that are going to take the place of cheap oil?
people have been saying peak oil is <10 years away since the 80s. LOL yet another idiot parroting big oils biggest lie. nuclear power is the solution they don't want people advocating.
Bro everything we own is made of oil, its not going anywhere anytime. "Less use of oil" has only one meaning,.....yall are gunna get so poor you cant afford it anymore.
It really annoys me when people always say "infinite" or "near infinite" money when talking about arab oil rich countries. If they had infinite money they could just stop producing oil today and coast forever they wouldnt need a transition plan. Weirdly enough when people talk about the Norwegian sovereign wealth fund they say its a 1 trillion fund, they dont say that they have infinite money, but other arab oil nation have "infinite money" The Norwegian soveraign wealth fund could also fund moronic $100B superproject too if they wanted but they just know its stupid and wasteful.
Now i can't wait to see how this and other tranformations the world will face in 20 yrs. The only thing for sure....               is that it will not be good for the avg working class citizen.
Look at all the money they have to spend in order just to attract a very small fraction of tourism that México gets on a regular basis each and every year. All of those mega expensive projects are doomed to fail. All of us regular folk are going to be priced out of there immediately.
So you're saying Saudi Arabia think it can build "the wall"  for about 5 times the UK spend on half-built high speed rail line. That's... optimistic! I'm sure the slave labour from immigrant workers help press costs but not to that extend.
All these project are pure waste.

00:38 Yeah the goverment might say that, but the car industry/companies and consumers do not 😂
Corruption at its best how do you have a winter game in desert? Wow I guess money does talk
It won’t work. If the Middle East wants to survive, it needs to be somewhere that people *want* to live. The average human hates the Middle East, the culture is horrible and the laws are barbaric, with little to no freedom.   No way you attract talent for a post-oil economy when your only attraction is money, and now you’ve run out. SA is the fat geriatric who just lost all his lotto winnings.
19:39 Indeed, the Crown Prince always says that he depends on us, as the oil field will not become what it was , I'm glad he came at this time. We have become accustomed to the old king throwing oil money at us, which has made many of us lazy.
hoser, this is probably your most edited video ever. the animation was very entertaining
Oil isn't dead, it just can't sustain the Corrupt  petrostate dictators
As a gulf Arab youth myself, not a Saudi tho, we share the same issues but on a smaller less acute scale because of our smaller size. For the entire neighborhood the trickiest bit would be restructuring that social contract (which I personally think is badly needed and is very long overdue) but without leaving citizens with the short end of the stick. Local authorities can't expect citizens to forgo of their oil-dependent financial safety buffers without first demonstrating shared responsibility (reducing royal court spending, tackling institutional and systemic corruption etc).
13:23 _stares at Overwatch_
"Peak" oil demand. The annual oil consumption doesn't increase at that point. The saudi oil sheiks are wealthy beyond imagination. A third of the population is cheap imported workers who get paid pennies while being treated like dirt.  And there is a perfectly logical idea for them to make the transition, but they'll have to throw me a couple million just to share it. Because why not. They are building waterparks in a desert.
This is México in the 70s all over again
Kazakhstan mentioned RAAAHHH🇰🇿🇰🇿🇰🇿🦅🦅🦅
The beginning to an end...
the green revolution is a Hoax that dreamy people in the west dream about to make themselves feel morally righteous while they outsource their whole industries to china where everything runs on coal , oil is going nowhere ... the  day oil ends there willl be a collapse of civilization ... saudi Arabia already have wealth beyond imagination..
4:40 is that tanki online?! 😭
Yeah, I'd never go to Saudi Arabia. That whole country including the culture, is nothing but toxic in a nutshell. It's hard to be more corrupt than the Saudi's.
KSA won't be able to produce much else to expect significant wealth from their national resources if they stop exporting oil. Instead, the effective plan is to do like Norway. KSA already has a large sovereign wealth fund. If they can protect it through strong control and investment strategy, that will be their best bet. Avoid high risk and VC. Go with proven long-term bonds, market index and banking. If they can keep to a system of reinvesting over half of all returns and limit cashing out (Norway's fund is capped at 3% a year), then they can keep wealth going for generations.  Their concern for domestic projects should be in the form of well-paid jobs for their own people. Becoming a welfare kingdom like Brunei will cause long-term problems. Biotech, IT, financial services,  healthcare are all good areas to invest in domestically. Not convinced KSA will be a big exporter of anything other than O&G. If they can export tech or something of that nature in the future, then great. But I wouldn't expect it.  NEOM is a bit too large and centralized and, IMO, exposes them too much to real estate development. They're already doing massive real estate development projects all over KSA in and around their cities. NEOM just seems a bit too much like a white elephant.
Oil wont go anywhere
Without cheap oil, we may forget about cheap travel, especially by plane. And without airplanes, say goodbye to long distance tourism into such a remote areas as the near east.
I call cap on peak oil
Neom is built on stolen indigenous land btw but nobody will tell you that bc they want all the free oil money
Man i would do anything to see you doing video about Algeria (plz help to get this comment to hoser)
How long until we start seeing illegal oil drilling facilities in Antartica? Whole continent probably full of untapped resources
You know what still need oil and gas to produce? Mineral fertiliser, lime materials used to lime fields. Acidic material to reduce the ph of alkaline soils. 30% of the worlds soil is acidic, the rest are either too alkaline or regular. As long as farming exists fossile fuels will be needed to mine minerals to introduce them to the fields to make yields higher. Nowadays we produce wheat grain with a ratio of 1 planted to 20 grown. In old times we produced 1 to 5 and that was on a good year.  So i don't think Saudis are losing relevance any time soon and i named only 1 major industry.
ICE cars and plastics aren’t going anywhere.
14:25 they aren't going to get the tourists until they embrace intoxicants and debauchery. I have literally ZERO desire to go to ANY place in the KSA for ANY reason really. I enjoy marijuana and looking at certain parts on women, none of this exists over there. I can see flashy lights anywhere, why in the heck would I go there with all the restrictive laws. THAT ALONE will cause the ultimate fall of the KSA. Will be funny looking back on videos like this in 20 years or so if we are still around God willing.
Oil ended up being a curse for the countries that have it, except Norway, they have a government that doesn't stink
been there... from my point of view... i think the local population is not ready to give up their "im the rentier and youre my slave" mentality towards the foreigners... i wish them good luck... but with things like a riyadh subway (which was supposed to be done years ago... and i left before they managed to do it... my hopes are low...
They went all in on Capitalism. They are “Manifesting” so hard right now 😂
bullsh°°. saudi arabia's oil industry is much less sensitive to market developments than other national oil industries, because they have the world's lowest extractions cost. america is scraping the bottom of the barrel and paying $60 to squeeze oil out of fracked shale and shoveled vvtar sand. russia is paying probably $30-40, largely because the extraction in the arctic and in the arctic sea is a naturally hostile work environment. saudi arabia literally just turns on the taps of the pipes it has drilled into the ground, and out flows proper liquid oil that the US has run out of, at a cost of $3 per barrel. that is why they have so much power through leveraging oil prices - the US, russia and saudi arabia each produce similar total amounts of crude each year, but for the saudis, the profit margin is gigantic. on one hand, they can (while also getting other OPEC countries to follow) dramatically reduce oil exports and make the global oil prices jump up, while still making good money from the little they do sell. on the other hand, they can increase output and drive down the prices, and knock out the most expensive oil producers who can only either shut down their operations or continue with government subsidies (which US oil already depends on). if the oil price fell and fell, saudi arabia would be the last country whose oil remains profitable.
The green post oil nonsense have failed miserably nothing can or will replace oil
Hot takes froma caunk based solely off of the unlikely event oil is phased out in 10 years because "gub says so". Get a grip dude.

More artificial cities like dubai, yep, the thing that most tourist like
I've been hearing about "peak oil" since a couple decades ago. We will not hit peak oil in this centuary.
Oil is dead. Oil remains dead. And we have killed him. How shall we comfort ourselves, the murderers of all murderers? What was holiest and mightiest of all that the world has yet owned has bled to death under our knives: who will wipe this oil off us? What oil is there for us to burn? What festivals of atonement, what sacred games shall we have to invent? Is not the greatness of this deed too great for us? Must we ourselves not become oil simply to appear worthy of it?
"Oil is a technically finite resource". There's no "technically" about it, it is 100% finite and does not renew. That's literally the reason why everything else is called "renewable"
Problem is they called for peak oil back in the 70s
At least if your economy is 75% dependent on wheat, sugar, or coffee, you can always replant and grow a next year harvest. You're at the whims of the demands of the consumer, but there will always be a next year harvest. Coal and oil don't regenerate if you burry it and water it.
Saudi arabia bout to follow venezuela's footsteps if they don't switch from oil.
Hoser uploads ☞ i am happy
Since they have all of those jurassic fields, do they have a lot of fossils?
damn 13k viiews in 43 mintutes
To be honest, calling it a gamble is a bit of an understatement. Their plans all range from crazy, to downright idiotic. I mean there's no shortage of people who have pointed out how silly some of the Saudi's plans are, with things like The Line and Mukaab taking most of the heat with how absurd they are.  Let's be real here, a lot of these ideas sound cool in concept, but I sincerely doubt most of them are feasible. Even if they were, I'm not sure if they'd make as big of an impact as the Saudis are hoping.
Japan is too mountainous and Europe is too cold, wet and rural to swap to EV's. Tte power grid, lack of charging space, etc, etc, etc, will always block the EV fad from being more than a drivable NFT marking the gullible for the scammers to target with Scientology level grifts.

I like their goals but their methods are so questionable
Oil is dead is the no 1 slogan of many political groups since the 1980s. In 2024, somehow, oil is still around, and Saudi Aramco is worth $1.866Tn (more than the Russian GDP).
California banned internal combustion engine cars from production after 2030 too
7:35 but no real dreams for all humans. tats the big problem of this egoistic giants.
Eh, at least they’re trying something
There's no way EVs will be ready for 2035. Maybe if the model 2 becomes real but then how bad will the range be? More importantly, i dont think the infrastructure is there yet. We need way more powerplants, more chargers, and more transmission towers.
How about some basic human rights? No? Okay pal...
hi
electric cars dont make sense. The battery's lose capacity too fast and need replacing in just 3 to 7 years. Then the battery replacement is so expensive your car is a paper weight.
EIA has constantly said we are going to see "Peak" oil demand. They said the scamdemic marked the peak behind us than we have broken it every year since.
15:26 OUF as a Canadian that hits a little too close. I hope the housing market implodes one day so I can afford a house
JUST USE YOUR OWN OIL, Saudis! You're not a bajillion people, you can afford it!
Vision 2030 sounds like a 14 year old designed that. Lets be energy neutral! Yeah lets also build a open ski resort in the desert 😂
They could've just invested all in dividend paying stocks and etc like Norway! Their wealth fund would've worth 5-7 trillion dollars
So weird watching the country of aging medieval throwbacks turning into a crypto bro playground.
sss
Dont forget our knowledge of their love of supporting muslim extremists! Its easily their favourite export besides oil.
Hear me out. Solar panels. Saudi Arabia is a huge dessert wasteland right? well if they build a ton of solar panels and  can some how transfer that energy to other countries and get said countries to pay for that energy then they can just replace the oil with THE SUN and litterly get a infinite money source. I might be wrong tho.
One of the smoothest ad transitions I’ve seen in a while 👏🏼 I’d even dare to say it’s on par with Drew Gooden👏🏼

When Saudi fucking Arabia is considering giving women some rights to get them into the workplace and increase economic growth, you know they're desperate to get off of oil
Казахстан сила казахи експортять нафту
Hoser!!! Omg
The deeeeeeeper issue is that desert nations are devoid of vegetation, and thus "generate" no new oil to add to their pile... not that that's an immediate concern, but the Saudis are probably lying about discovering new gallons at the rate they have. 😅
I gotto be honest i totaly agree on the point where you mentioned if arabia is known by its religious sites or the oil and as a muslim i do believe that arabai says oil whenever comes to my mind but Makkah and Medina are places where i visiualise by themselves not as part of the uae and their speciality makes these places uniqe and sorta independent if i dare to say 😅
That's a decade in the future, and they're always wrong about predictions that far away.
Islamic territory especially the arab peninsula pre oil were a bunch of tribes in constant war sawing each others heads off in some form of honor killing. After oil they will return to this barbarism is it is their/Islam's nature.
Every time they predict peak oil, they get it wrong; whether due to incompetence in the complacent producers, or sudden competence from nations holding back for public image reasons... or just flat-out lying, of course. Some say the Saudis will run out of oil in 2030.
The EU is dumb and gay!
Fun fact from the Red Line Podcast's episode of the green line seires focusing on climate change and Saudi Arabia, the Saudis will be actually the last ones producing oil profitably because their extraction is the cheapest. Basically as demand plummets and prices will drop, the more expensive extraction places for oil will become unprofitable eventually decreasing supply and thus giving a larger market share to Saudi Arabia, and this will create an interesting dynamic where Saudi Arabia by the virtue of geography will be one of the least affected by the end of oil. In contrast places like Nigeria will be the hardest hit by plummeting demand for oil because their more expensive oil will no longer be profitable.  This was the specific episode I believe: https://youtu.be/22TD2KOrLAk?si=4tqW5xTLRz1kPPRD
The developed world will use less oil, sure. But economic growth in the 3rd world will keep oil booming for more than 20 years.
Oh man I can't imagine how much money contractors and such are making fleecing the Saudi's. If you're able to get into tossing them dumb investment opportunities, it's basically free money.

EVs will be a failure, but even if that wasn't the case, Saudi Arabia still has a few decades to get something going, and oil will carry on being one of the (or maybe the most) important energy sources in the world. They will be fine. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
I will say the N-word 1 time each like on this comment in the next 24 hours
Yup this is definitely the first time some one said that oil is dead…. I honestly don’t think that has nothing to do with why they are diversify their economy. I think they’re doing it because historically speaking, it’s never been a good idea for a economy to be so relied on one source.
Saudi Arabia is the gonna be the first country to make it back to the hood
