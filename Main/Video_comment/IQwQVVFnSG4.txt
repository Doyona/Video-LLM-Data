What are your thoughts on Rhea Ripley joining Edge and Damian Priest?
❤❤❤
Their true chapter began at Clash At The Castle that September, and 2023 was the year they ruled Monday Night Raw💜
Rhea Ripley is STILL dealing with Liv Morgan. 😅😂
Wait her and Liv been beefing for 2 years
I remember edge created the judgment day until he got kicked out and came back to finish the story. Finish the story that he just left off
Hey Damian Priest please joining Judgement Day  new MEMBER Judgement Day
Look where they at now edge at ALL EMPT WRESTLING , THE JUDGEMENT DAY NOW ARE THE BEST FACTION IN WWE
I think edge would’ve won some titles if he kept this gimmick
rhea then to rhea now, wow💟
The Judgment Day just isn't the same without Edge.
I am the officially the 1,000th comment of this video...
Until they kicked u out for Finn Balor
Same thing punk said in 2011 pipebomb
It’s funny when Damien priest said ALL RISE and everyone start standing 😂
She is nice stronger 💪 champion 🏆 big women 😉😉
Pantalón era pero te gana John Cena
I love the judgement day it was awesome
“You don’t like what you see, number 1 because you’re UGLY” 😂😂😂
4:33 Poor little Liv!
Edge is once again a villain. He changes sides more times than the Big Show.
My favorite  wwe edge 😍 💙 ❤
The different classes in are society symbolically assembled.
They should add Beth to this group.
PUT THE BELT ON RIPLEY AND ON PRIEST!!
The era of wwe where the people love the heels more than faces
2:05 All rise.....I SAID, ALL RRRIIISSEE!!!
you  made   ONE  MORE  MEMBER   TO  JOIN  YOUR  CULT  tomas  would  be  a  good  pick
good on rhea.....she is a heel through and through
Edge is phenomenal on the mic and ring
I believe Raya Ripley was already over I don't think but joining a faction is or was going to change any of that..
Next is Alexis bliss for the guys theory
now add Balor
They make a great couple as well Priest and Ripley
Finn Balor is next, thought it was Ciampa! Google it Judgement Day is about to be🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
It's crazy how Damian Priest is still relevant
Oooooooooo, this is gonna be good.
From here on out we will refer to edge  As the Promosarus rex
Rhea using paige story line
It was funny getting insulted by edge when I was there LMAO
Liv Morgan Finn balor and AJ style should be a good team vs judgement day gonna be a good story line
Edge your a fossil ! Retire  !!
Edge might be W Morrissey fka big cas legit father
Next is Finn
new cool team in WWE
Edge is a bum. No way he should ever have a win on Aj Styles.
🗑🗑🚮🚮🚮🚮
Anyone notices rhea and edge has the exact same haircut. who wears it better tho.
they are wasting edge lmao
They need gold around their waist, soon!
why doesn aj insult the fans?
Christian should come back and join them or return with Tyson Tomko as a face to feud with Edge and Priest
About time I stand up for his
Yes Adam Damian and Rhea awesome stable :)
Pilana predicted it
EDGE is carrying WWE RAW
Lame, stealing Alistair Blacks character and making it generic, boring,and predictable.
As someone from CT the comment about Hartford wasn't even heel it was just a fact. High cost of living, crime rate, and corruption; why do we live here, again?
What the heck Edge got a haircut .
Edge is such a great heel, but he's just too talented an good looking to not be a baby face.
Edge is right about the sheep here still doing the what chant twenty years later.
Edge need to fire that barber who cut his hair
They need Nia Jax
Undertaker-lite
Seth Rollins should join 🔥
Lame cm puck did it already & that was stupid 15 years later edge is doing it stupid again
This reminding me of evolution 👍👍
....CM Punk called, he wants his Straight Edge Society back.
Love Heel Edge dude is awesome
Judgement Day is my shizzzzznit
This sucks I miss the old wwe 😪
Weird
I think she listened to my comment on Instagram  to stop smiling so much🤣
niggas got bitched into stand w promo
Also Edge, Damien and Rhea are trying to hard to be angry and no pun intended edgy. It's cheap and easy to cry to the audience wah wah wah you don't appreciate me, you don't care, you're selfish, it's your fault I can't accomplish my goals because I pander to you. It's so juvenile and cringe.
I don't understand why Fox uploads clips from Raw on USA, and USA uploads clips from SmackDown on Fox.
Ah yes another tortured soul
Why is there a fox logo on thumbnail?
When the bloodline and the judgment day class and make no mistake it will happen, naomi needs to join the bloodline
Is this supposed to be like the Straight  Edge society
The brood 2.0
This is my Brutality um it’s a heel term not face so I’m glad she turn heel it just fit the bill right
I dont watch WWE but they actually got them something special here if the writers dont mess it up. Even though i dont watch everyone know who Edge and AJ Styles are.
Rheas loooks fucken dope! I hope she elevates🔥🔥🔥 she's just what we need!
Edge coming back is the greatest thing to happen to wwe! And of course my main man Rey😎
HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE name, smfh
The judgement day vs. the New Day...
Besides the Bloodline, The Judgement Day is the best thing in the WWE
Those are facts , that wwe fans in denial
Rhipy Rhipy Love ❣️❣️❣️
Does this dude priest have on makeup and eye liner ?
Love you Edge.
Idk man but I'd be shocked happy and surprised if Christian Cage returned and joined The Judgement Day. Christian > Edge imo though. But there chemistry was always amazing. From the Brood, to the Ministry, to E&C.
Every heel uses the same line about the autographs, jajajaja
oh look is another form of "The Brood" but just in a different type of gothic
Any time you can get the crowd to subconsciously respond to you, you're on the right track. Good Job Priest
Is Arnold Schwarzenegger joining this group anytime soon?
I'll be honest, I'm surprised by Rhea
Writers: "Hey, I have an idea. How about we co-opt part of Punk' s pipebomb? Let's just recycle almost everything from the last 25 years!"
Edge needs to be inducted into the hall of fame again just because of this faction
LMFAO HE CALLED US KEYBOARD WARRIORS, ISTG I LOVE EDGE BRO LMFAO HE'S SO FUNNY
The what chants are so damned old and annoying.
Judgment day..like the new day but cornier
Too me.. edge turning heel doesn't feel right. He can make a good heel but it just doesn't seem right to me.
I’m mad I took em this long to figure this out……
2:46 - Obvious CM Punk throwback is obvious.
Great, now Rhea can be EVEN more edgier.
never knew an LOL doll was a real kids toy until now hehehehe
What is tha miz thinking about this
The judgement day is a dumb name. I like the members and the style of this stable but the name is trash.
This is Edge's leader of the brood moment
The fact that he said the stuff about keyboard warriors then wwe popped up their hashtag on twitter immediately after is hilarious 😂
Edge is a master on the mic 🎤. This new Faction is going to be a jolt for the company what a great heel turn.
Edge said he looking for more too
She’s giving me new age Chyna vibes
Rhea and priest, they look like they don't wanna be there
Tell us how you really feel edge
edge needs to retire already.
And here I thought The New Day was a dumb name for a faction. If WWE put more effort into releasing the writers rather than the talent, the show would be more entertaining.
I feel like they need some cool gothic chairs.
Yes! We must embrace the Dark Side.
Yall think edge is gonna have a affair with rhea?
Judgement Day is probably going to be the reason why I'm going to watch WWE again. Lol
Judgement Day is upon us...🤘🏼
this whole promo comes across like an AA meeting... and what's with those stupid "what" chants? grow the fck up...
Shane McMahon Stephanie McMahon Chuck Palumbo Diamond Dallas Page booker T JBL APA boogeyman the Dudley boyz Jeff Jarrett Karen Jarrett jerry lawler Scott Steiner Scotty 2 hotty Stacy Keibler Santino Marella Santina Marella Snoop Dogg Shaquille O’Neal
We still love u edge!!!!!!!
Badass and I love it.  Everything that was said by the Judgement Day is 100% Correct. I love this trio, cannot wait to see what lies ahead for The Judgement Day. All of Haters can drink a bottle of haterade to quench their hater mouth
Is having a bad hair cut a prerequisite for joining this faction?
I’m I the only one notice that someone threw a hat in the ring
I felt like liv could have been here as well.
I don't know much about Rhea or damion but it's amazing seeing edge back in the heel role that made him the hall of Famer that he is. But damon's voice could freeze time and Rhea well I think will be a bruiser good job wwe finally something right in my opinion in years
God Edge looks ancient
Such a dumb name for a stable. Was better as a PPV
Edge is so good as a heel. His body may not work like it use to but man he can cut a promo with best of them.
Look like a million dollars edge
Edge has always been the perfect heel. This going to be awesome for Rhea and Damian Damian is great in the ring. I am a fan heel or face it really doesn't matter this means a lot for his career
Look edge has tried everything in his power to get over since his 2020 return nothing has worked. This little stable simply isn't it. Just retire..
Wait until The Almighty joins judgement day 🫣
Roman: Acknowledge Me!!!! Priest: I SAID…ALL RISE!!!!!
Diarrhea Ripley joinin ...heh still womp womp woooommp
Bro just imagine if Edge snatched Riddle away from Orton… all I can think about is the pictures of Rhea, Damien, & Riddle together…
Damien “The Punishment” has a nice ring to it. 🤔 throwback to his roots “Punishment Martinez”
I WILL STAND WITH EDGE AND AND YOU KNOW I HAVE BEEN USED I FILL THE SAME WAY AS RHEA RIPELY USED AND NOW I STAND WITH EDGE
thats a promo
I FILL LIKE A STEP ON AND I WANT TO STAND WITH YOU EDGE I WANT TO BE A SANT OF FATE
My NAME IS RAYMOND AND EDGE I AGREE WITH YOU AND I BACK YOU 100 PERCENT I WILL STAND WITH YOU
Heel edge is the best.
They should be in mortal kombat with the miz
I support Edge and the judgment day
There has been plenty of wrestlers u came back from surgery
Damien priest and Rhea are the champs here edge is way past his prime
I'm not a huge fan of the name of the group but, on the flip side, this group has the potential to be untouchable for the rest of this year for sure if properly booked.  Rhea and Priest should both get massive pushes and should have gold around their waists by Survivor Series if not sooner.  I also think another male superstar will join them and he and Edge could go after the tag team titles because I don't see WWE taking any title off of Reigns for the foreseeable future.  All sorts of possibilities.
God the wwe is still dogshit
I believe that Finn Balor's ulter ego Demon would be a great team with Edge,  Damian and Rhea
Imagine Judgement Day against Roman and the Usos  Judgement Day all the way
Did Edge cut his hair??
May 6, 2002 - WWE Monday Night RAW from Hartford Civic Center in Hartford, Connecticut. First RAW under WWE Name.   May 9, 2022 - WWE Monday Night RAW from Hartford Civic Center in Hartford, Connecticut. 20 years and 3 days later.
Hopefully Aj styles get his revenge he lost twice
Rhea Ripley has the same birthday as me, October 11th
Edge is good... "Number one, because you're ugly" wow.... lol
Edge and Damien Priest vs RK-Bro feud for the Raw Tag Titles. Please WWE! Make it happen.
Lmfao Priest telling everyone to rise and the crowd follows was hilarious. Crowd dont want none of priest lol
Imagine Darby Allin crossing the forbidden door and joining The Judgement Day
Edge has the same hair due as Rhea.
The promos were straight heat in this segment happy for priest and Ripley.time to destroy the roster.judgement day has arrived 🙌
So he had a surgery on his weewee
Priest has such a good voice, he could become more than a WWE Superstar in the future. Wouldnt be surprised to see him in movies.
Promos take up too much time
Judgement day vs Bloodline, right now!
Edge took over Gangrels Job this is the New Broods
THIS is her brutality...
Well I'll be damned wrestling actually looks like its entertaining. This is just great and edge just continues to deliver.
love all 3 but the ebay part was kinda lame though feel like i’ve already heard that line before
This faction looks pretty lame so far tbh...
Rhea is a man.
It's funny how edge is the new stuff Rollins for when he had AOP and buddy Murphy
??? Why did edge cut his hair??? It worked better with the long hair
Edge is AMAZING man
I like the group but I don't really get Edge's motivation.  A LOT of people cared that he fought to come back after 9 years
She just used CM Punk's schtick. Whack.
Trash scripted promo
Edge lying we do care and we’re not ugly
💡... It would be interesting 🤔 to see Priest  & the American Nightmare 🇺🇲 in the $$ in the bank match.  Especially since Damian claim he can beat anyone. Is Edge a manager now? Maybe, Time to shut Edge up 🤐🇺🇲🤑 If Cody wins, hopefully he will donate the 💰💰💰 to Charity.😃
1:34 EVIL!!! SO FRICKIN’ EVIL!!!!! 😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡
Edge will do wonders for her career
I don’t know what is worse; the stupid names of the new wrestlers, or the lame gimmicks that they try to sell. Attitude era matches are the only thing worth watching in wrestling now
Lame....takes three people to beat AJ....and Edge sucks
Don't be mean Rhea. Please stop it. Please.
Umm, isn't Rhea just repeating a cm punk interview , and wtf is this, a reincarnation of a wyatt family or something. Ugh the cult thing is done. Wwe killed it with wyatt. Please stop
Freak shows have always been a popular crowd pleaser. Everything old is new again.
God I love Edge. One of the best heels in wrestling. Hope this stable stays around a long time. It looks like a good way to assist newer talent that hasn’t been given a proper shot get some more mainstream exposure. Also loving the Undertaker-ish aspects. Especially since Edge was in the Ministry of Darkness so you can say he was‘exposed’ to Undertaker’s powers.
This faction is what got me watching again after they released John Morrison! I'm excited to see what's in store for them.
So in other words nothing new is going on. WWE is so boring now.
Man... 3 wrestlers I really like, and they couldn't think of a better name?  The name didn't even last when they tried to make it a ppv.  This is an awesome team, but come on Vince... there has to be a better name.
I would like to see RKBro vs Edge & Damien
If I hear him call the crowd sheep one more time or if I’m better than everyone 😒
y not just let he win a match? she is more than capable of winning matches. she’s prob stronger than half the guys in the locker room. y make her look like Motionless in White?
We've seen this homework before very similar…............................………   Something called, the straight edge society.
Would Seth Rollins fit in Judgement Day?
It would be nice if The Undertaker should be a manage of the group.
I want to see Roman reigns
Really I’ll have to say is boooooooooo
I'm feeling this judgement day faction
Edge looks sharp with the new cut
Edge is funny
It’s so funny with edge roasting us
edge looks pretty silly with that short hair cut
People still yelling What  bc of stone cold.
For what edge through for 9 years they ignored him, but I appreciate edge!
Don't talk about Liv like that 😭😭 Edge is right though. Lol
I was waiting for the GONG to go off. You know what I mean 😏 😁🤘
This new edge character is stupid
I'm sorry to make this group a legit threat and pushing Rhea and Damien you have to put the belt on edge otherwise it's just another faction for me.
Yes didn't think i need this group because i can't stand priest ever but i can tolerate him know finally my girl rhea is going to get her monster push
Did you even notice that there is a hat behind Rhea Ripley?   Did any of you guys saw it?
I feel like this is the last time they are gonna get fans to boo Edge, he is gonna get to the point where fans love him no matter what.
Edge is bad now smh
Crazy that Edge is really back.
This is a dream come true for Rhea being in a stable with one her favorite superstars of all time
Hey guys I think I miss the rhea ripley she is the coolest woman superstar I cared about since the moment I first met her   Rhea ripley you are the best loving woman superstar I cared about you Rhea I cared about you and Edge and Damien you guys are awesome hope guys have a good day guys Rhea you are awesome Rhea
Evil is evil does!!!!!
God's JUDGEMENT DAY is almost here. Repent as the ANTICHRIST is coming
Tht would have been good if they would have presented it better. Much like Bliss's return. Lack luster.
Edge is brilliant with his heel in judgment day.   I pray WWE will allow  Edge to manage this group , they are so good.   Rhea made the right move.  It wasn’t in her character to be a nice girl when her clothes and Character presented a dark heel.   Dark heel is always best for a wrestler,  if they know how to work it💀💀
Damien Priest Voice, Scary ASF!
Edge has a history of begin in faction. 1st was the Brood and the ministry of darkness.
Awful name lol
Personally I really hope Edge chooses T-Bar as the 4th member instead of Ciampa. They need to give him his Dijakovic name back & just unleash him as the real talented wrestler he is. Of all the NXT call-ups he's the one guy that's been held back the most in my P.O.V. Big fan of this guy & I hate to see him being wasted
Random thought: I thought Rhea Ripley and Damian Priest were dating. I would've enjoyed this faction even more if they were a couple, personally
You think Rhea and Edge have the same barber?
AND IM SORRY I KNOW IM NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO THINKS EDGE VS AJ AT BOTH SHOWS WERE LACKLUSTER
I WANT EDGE TO TAKE A BREAK FOR 3 OR 5 MONTHS HES GETTING STALE AND THS SHOWS IM SEEING CM PUNKS STRAIGHT EDGE SOCITEY HERE AND I HATED THAT
Now how is this going to help Rea with her career?.. nothing good is to come of it
W W E idots
Now I remember why edge was a good heel
Not only is rhea dominant she is also very easy to look at especially as a heel god that woman is downright perfect can’t wait to see her crush competition like a monster truck crushes cars
The Saints of Faith? .... I like that 😎
Rhea is already a star. She should be on top of the women's division. Damian Priest could be something but has a very long way to go. Edge is boring...he was boring 20 years ago and he is boring now. He was never more than a midcard talent that got very lucky. Also, factions are so overdone that this will be nothing special. I miss wrestling- this is bad high school theater.
Rhea Ripley joining Edge Facation is great 👍.
So they just ripped off pieces of the pipebomb promo from a decade ago?
Heard this before re runs  lol come up with some new story lines
I came here for edge haircut
I'm was so glad when she got away from Liv, because rhea is on another level and was being held back. She's phenomenal
Am I the only one thinking Edge is getting stale already?  The same promo every week.  I like what he's doing with the group but his promos are getting too predictable.
Oommgg this is gonna be amazing 👏 I'm getting ministry of darkness vibes, taker might be behind the whole thing..
Nah this stable is wack I'm not gonna lie they just threw these fools together wwe is all over the place 😅
Why is this being suggested to me?! People still watch this stuff? Do the still watch Jerry Springer as well?
I think the three of them are looking in a fun house mirror, they all have the same hair cut lmao.. half bald. I can look in a mirror and my eyes don’t pop out of my head either edge.. priest come on now your attitude changed when you lost loser.. and Ol girl ripely, Morgan has your number and she has better looks by a lot lol, keep dreaming
Rhea, gurl, what you doing on Ebay?
BOOOOOOO!😮
Wwe finally getting it lets gooooo
Make Priest dress like shoah Khan. He has the voice and size.
Is it me or did Edge cut his hair
I love the faction but why you gotta cut your hair Edge?????
Love Jesus. Build hope, faith, and trust on his word.
So judgement day went from being. A PPV to. A tag team lololol
Now they finna bury liv😭
The "Saints of Fate" line was dope.
Wait, is the entire concept of Judgement Day that Edge got trolled into instability? Oof.
“I’m done being used “ priest literally just called her a instrument 😂😂😂
Way to go Damian another Puerto Rican doing his thing....
No offense no one is buying rhea Ridley autograph anything 😂
Great haircut edge
Edge look perfect whith HeS new haircut style 💪💪💪💪
Jesus Christ this is very cringe trio gimmick makes me wonder how will it end
Just needs a new name. I think everyone needed this
Edge I would destroy you
Edge still cuts some of the best promo's in the business!!
I’m glad edge is back good the see a real heel group
Ripley always looks so big compared to the other women, I was surprised to see shes 5"7
BRING ON CIAMPA
Their needs to be a mixed tag team match liv aj and the prince vs the judgement day
Meh
Edge looking like Murphy from Z Nation
Shut up edge
So edge is the new gangrel
edge is an amazing face but as a heel he’s just  on another level
This is awesome. Edge is so good at getting heel heat and he’s so great on the mic. Priest is so much better as a heel, and Rhea needed this. She had been floundering in the mid card for too long and her talent is too great for that. I hope she finishes her rivalry with Liv Morgan and then goes on to have a great rivalry with Bianca Belair. Rhea in this gimmick as Raw women’s champion would be awesome. Judgement Day needs some gold!
hows a business haircut fit this stable at all. bahhaa
I’m happy I’m getting my rated R WWE Spinner Championship today!!
ohhh this is nice caught me off guard here 😁😁😁
I love this group but I really feel like they should drop the “The” in their name. Simply “Judgment Day” would be perfect.
Edge speaking facts tho
Shayna B would have been better.  More believable
If Russia Launches Missles
Edge is underrated on the stick for sure
Love needed Rhea thats the other way around.
Priest legit scared the crowd into standing up Gawdamn
I'm loving everything about this, but they need to drop the "The". It's so much better as just Judgement Day.
All rise And some idiots actually rose up lmao
Those should disciplines wear hooded cowls worshippers all around the ring
The legion of darkness has risen
Real Knights        🙌🏾
Did he have surgery on his Johnson
I thought edge had a sore neck
MTF ?
Gosh hearing Damien on the mic is like watching paint dry lmao
This is what competition looks like and gives you in wrestling programming. Aew has a good week ok, wwe answers with a decent week. Then back and forth and we the fans get rewarded.
I think Edge would be a great manager. Imagine this stable growing with Edge in charge
She definitely needed a dominant push cause to this point she was only used good bk in nxt honestly
It took me a minute to notice that Rhea had a scale under her eye. Thought it was an old telephone
The guy at 2:14 had me laughing
Edge is a literal genius and quite ballsy for taking such a dramatic step this late in his career. This is very well done, let's just hope the wwe doesn't drop the ball on this one.
Add Ciampa and then stop…
Rhea shouldn’t have been standing out there already when they announced her
Edge acting like a undertaker wannabe
Can't even lie, they look good together..
Really Edge? He’s a cool actor. Edge knows for a fact that the fans care about him
This is going to flop
I wanna be in judgement day. Love the dark sh**
I can’t wait to watch how this unfolds. I think this is Awesome
This is stupid. Just bring back Bray Wyatt.
Same ol edge I see smh all about him
🖓🖓🖓🖓🖓🖓🖓🖓🖓🖓🖓🖓🖓
Edge has always been incredible as a heel.
Weve heard the my autograph on Ebay, and the airport bit before, I think Daniel Bryan used it last😂
I love Edge with his meta promos lol I'd buy a Judgment Day shirt
This make absolutely no sense the crowd loved edge when he came back
Heel edged so amazing
Best version of edge hands down
Let's see how long they actually last.
All this faction needs is an enforcer.
I called this when rhea attacked liv
You dumbasses couldn't come up with a better name then "judgment day" how phuckn lame what losers a has-been I want to be and never will be
They need help. All three of them. Especially old man edge.  I don't don't know what they thinking. Idiots.
Boring
I like all three superstars especially Ripley. This promo and its content seemed a bit high school drama club in its delivery. Good moments, but the lines and the constant irrate movement took away from the dark allure and confidence and the untouchable air they are trying to convey. Hopefully the promo lines get better for the faction, but as of right now. This wasn't it for me chief.
That girl is tight rite.  Edge cool hair cut.  Something about to happen
I need a Judgement Day shirt ASAP. 🔥
This promo is R-Rated 🔥 🔥 🔥
You don't want to be used ? Then at the same time you work for Vince, wow it's Team hypocrisy
New day vs Judgement day
Edge sucks, always did. His lackey is terrible. An this thing w rhea is terrible.
3:00 thank you CM Punk
Ripely and Priest are getting a real-time masterclass in promos. I hope they go far!
KEYBOARD WARRIORS!
WWE is taking the laziest way possible to make this faction heel, insulting fans.  This had so much potential to be a great thing, and they're throwing it away with terrible writing.. par for the course I guess.
Priest is more believable from I saw in this clip.. Edge is having the time of his life. He's enjoying this. Anyone that knows Edge. He's such a genuine good guy that this isn't him. He can make the voice & face, but his words are so fake, they don't come out natural and as good as Priest. I see Priest turning on him in the future. overall the presentation was good and gives power to the faction.  Mic work gives life to the characters, and a bigger connection with the crowd than just wrestling & fighting. And doing it in the center of the ring is the way to go. 🌚
Heel Edge is the BEST Edge!
This is awesome  Damian saying  Rhea Ripley's name sounded extremely  heavy metal!!  Edge had a Christian,  now Saints of Faith in the Judgement Day!!  Badass
Way too much production nowadays.  The Rhodes/Theory match had three ring announcements of the contestants. 5-6 minutes of entrance music and intros.  The dumb graphic overlays floating in the air.  Overshadows the talent and match development.
The new kind of shield
Edge always delivers
Not really feeling this whole faction to be honest.
Can everyone admit that this gonna be an amazing faction and that they are gonna be dominant for a couple years
Okay moron: I'm on my keyboard, and gotta say, "You're really lame WWE entertainment."
The dark side of all of them and they are the dark Court
I love this promo as everything is the truth that they are saying as there are some of the WWE Universe that actually do the things that they mention. They get autographs and put them online to get money. Some of us are Keyboard peasants as am I writing this comment. We do things that are just crappy towards our favorite wrestlers or wrestlers that we despise. I have been a fan of all wrestling for decades grew up going backstage to thousands of shows. I've seen what some of the fans do to the wrestlers behind the scenes some are not pretty as we in the wrestling universe put doubt in some which in turn can cause dangerous situations in a match. We as wrestling fans need to think before we act as some of our actions have really horrible repercussions. I have done things that I'm not proud of like throwing a beer bottle inside a ring at one show and throwing my chair in another. I believe we as wrestling fans can make this happen and make all wrestlers life safer.
Rhea looks like Marilyn Manson
Truth in plain sight
Edge is 48 and can still perform at an elite level like before. I know age doesn’t truly matter in wresting anymore but I still find it awesome that the ones who are getting up there can still entertain us in so many different ways. I’m surprised that Edge isn’t talked about as much when it comes to the greatest of all time
Heel Edge i say again is God Mode!!!
Ok you have something go let it build it self
edge as a heel is the best thing ever, I know we are supposed to hate heels bit every time edge turned heel I loved it
Is this the opposite of The New Day?
It is going to be fun to watch these two very talented heels take the Raw roster apart. Hopefully they get the booking they deserve, especially Rhea. She is one of the best in the women's division, and needs to be treated accordingly.
ppl rose lmao tf
I love edge hair cut
Lmao juggernaut is way bigger and way stronger than rhea just to point that out.
Rhea is the most dominant and a beautiful woman on Raw and for her to join The Judgment Day is a great career move. Now Rhea has a great opportunity to get back the Raw Women's Championship belt from Bianca Bel-Air and any other woman that stands in her way.
I don’t know how I feel about edges haircut
Look at this...... The new "Triple Threat Of The WWE"
am i high or did they name their stable after a WWE PPV? Judgement Day? really? that was your best idea? this looks like Straight Edge Society 2.0 mixed with the old Brood Gimmick of being gothic and dark, its all played out and predictable and boring.
Not a surprise
So their named after a WWE PPV
Rhea Ripley copied CM Punk homework
Edge is being so mean
Lol 😆 said keyboard guess he is Xbox
Is it just me or Edge style make em look like Conor McGregor🤣
Cool haircut by edge
Edge helping these new generation wrestlers would be good for their career.
Edge is the best heel ever my number one favorite superstar
Most got up on that second all rise haha Rose up from the echo command
Judgment day !!!
I like this group !!!
Big facts
As I scroll through the comments and I’m sure somebody has already commented on it but are we just gonna bypass edges new look and also since he has been mentioned I’m gonna say it right now it would be badass if bray Wyatt is actually calling the shots and edge is just setting the motions for a bray Wyatt return as the leader of judgment day 🤷🏽‍♂️
So is wwe just filled with Emos now
Just wish they coulda came up with a more original name. Sound to close to The New Day
Aew forced wwe to have a edge again and it helps
This is a crazy faction I love this I love the new looks of both reah and now edge
"Number 1 because you're ugly."  🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
So they couldn’t come up with a better name than Judgement Day.?🤔🤔🙄🙄🙄
I see a Skeletor, Beast Man, and Evil Lyn reference in Rhea, Edge, and Damien
I'm much more into it with edge as a heel. He's better as a heel.
Have this group vs straight edge society
People in the comments saying love this version of Edge lol Been loving this version of edge Since he was with the brood
Edge called a human a LOL doll wwe has two or maybe three things right  1. The bloodline 2. The Judgment Day 3.Seth Freakin Rollins and his wife two separate factors but yeah
WWE FINALLY doing good storylines again
Loving Edge's new direction. His last few times on the mic, that I saw, are just golden. Judgement Day has me interested. Rhea is one of my favorite female wrestlers in WWE. Joining the group was a great decision.
Whats that on his head...
WHAT???
Hopefully joining Edge will slap some sense into her and stop being homophobic.
Did edge get a haircut?
The Group is 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Edge looks like a blowfish!!!  And he calls the crowd ugly. 😂😂😂😂
Rhea Ripley clone just sayin🤣🤦‍♂️🤷‍♂️
Why would edge cut his hair ??? Smfh
The Judgement Day......🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
The new Undertaker.
Fin balor and aj form the bullet club again vs the judgement day and the bloodline
Damm Never noticed how short Rhea is
Edge is a creative genius
This is such an Indy esque gimmick and stable. I’m surprised Vince gave approval. WWE has become more and more indy esque since 2019 but now it’s copy and paste
I think cena vs edge at summer slam
Good to see Punishment Martinez thriving.
Rhea Ripley looks like The Terrifier
Damian reminds me of goro from mk with how he has is hair
That was a great promo
This group is already pretty cringe
I love good new heels
Lol the reason she joined judgement day - as per story line is because little kids sold her autographs on eBay? Ok. 😂
This is the Real Edge ! HEEL AF!
Rhea needs to now become women’s champion
The Judgement Day. Wonder if there going to be a new stable called The Payback with AJ Styles, Finn Balor, and Liv Morgan. 🤣🤣🤣
Imagine if people didn’t already expect it?
Hey can we all agree to have these three wear same color attires so they can look like a real stable or Faction.
This reminds me of the time Chyna joined the Corporation!
Naomi and Sasha needs to join bloodline!
Ripley joins The Judgment Day because she doesn't tired of being used. The next day on the job she's being used. lol
None of these sentences need to be in that order and this promo could be completely randomized
Why did he cut his hair
Who else nowadays has better word plays than Edge? That man is a genius the way he cuts his promos.
Aj need to reform the oc club but with Finn and another guy
Nice Gozer look on Rhea.
Lol trying be a actual heel stable.  Arghhh kayfabe attempt.  While on instagram with babyfaces
Diarrhea Rhea woooooooo
The shadows throw me off lol
You know he is a heal now.  He is wearing a suit
Judgement day....Jesus Christ 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Edge has went full pastor
Add west lee n ciampa
He mad cause he didn’t/couldn’t be the head of the table😂😂😂
Rhea did not just rip off Punks pipebomb promo lol (Airport autographs and then selling them on eBay)....
Rhea Ripley is fine!
the group name sucks
Would it be a crazy idea having edge take the title off Roman??
all the little girls run up to her and tell her that they want to be butch?
Edge hasn't been the same since Smash Em, Stack Em, Pin Em
Edge's promo is good because he believes it. And he believes it, because he's telling the truth and then mixing in his heel persona. I hope he passes that knowledge down to Rhea and Damien.
Now why would he cut his hair lol
Now all they need is take a couple of major W's like the bloodline
I'm happy that Rhea Ripley has join Edge and Damian Priest
It's so great to see Edge bury AJ. So selfless.
Worst name ever for such a bad@$$ group!! Seriously, "Judgement Day"? 🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂 Why not Vengeance? Or Fully Loaded? Or Insurrection? 🤣😂 Armageddon, even?
She joined Judgement day cause they sold her autographs... I guess that would do it.
Vince will job her to Rhonda in a couple of months...
Edge is a beast on the promos legend 🔥🔥🔥
Keyboard Warriors that's funny... good one.
Edge is crazier than ever
So glad Rhea, Edge, and Damien Priest are all together. This is wonderful. I bet Edge is the one who brought this idea to the writers. It just feels too good for them to write.
Edge has major heat
Edge wrote this lol
all we need is ciampa to join judgement day and its complete
Naomi will now join bloodline on tv
HERE WE GO AGIAN
Everything Edge said is true.
This stable sucks. Blow this thing up.
This the edge i remember
What’s with like all of the big names on raw Wearing suits now
Reah ur gorgeous
I LOVE THEM 🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
Wow it was like he was talking to me while I type on my keyboard
Awful name 😔 great members
I am wondering what is the next step? If they will have AJ and Finn team with  Liz to form a team or faction to have  matches? And I'd love for them to eventually have Cody join Finn and Styles to have a spin off Bullet Club faction. Then have them face the Bloodline when Cody evetually wrestles Reigns for the title. The Bloodline then can add Naomi to have matches if they keep Liz with them and if they add another male wrestler to Judgment Day they can also have an angle and wrestle the Bloodline with mixed tag matches.
“Straight Edge Society” remake
I swear Damien Priest looks like Roman Reigns.
Next is Beth Phoenix on the team
I like that Edge has always stayed loyal to WWE and never went to other companies.  He just stayed with WWE and won a bunch of titles, hall of fame, and now this new group Judgement Day!
I LOVE THIS!!!
What moon knight
Now Tomasso Ciampa will join Judgement Day
Did Rhea Ripley change her entrance music?
"Rudder" R superstar?
Edge got himself a new haircut
I love it , I think ciampa  has to join next !!!
WWE trying to repackage it's self
I think we all know how this will turn out eventually.they only care about the bloodline.even the top talent that edge is won’t withstand Vince and his erratic booking
That haircut is horrible iam watching aew now
I cared edge
Why do I feel like they gonna bring back judgment day ppv
Edge looked scarier with his hair
The fans are not sheep
Edge it's not that is fans hate u it's the fact that u look stupid
Steven Regal wanna be
Can’t wait for new the upcoming faction: Cyber Sunday
They will betray stupid Edge.
This fraction will not last long. Love Rhea Ripley, she deserves a long championship reign.
Lmaohis is so cringey
I freaking love this. Damien Priest is the next WWE champion he definitely have that IT factor
Three of my favorite superstars making a faction? If we're gonna get goth, let Alexa Bliss join and resurrect The Fiend
I love how they want them to be heels, but everyone loves them
edge ain’t have to play Hartford we know we morons 😒😒
This is what Edge does and does very well I might say
I love this group, nothing is going to stand in their way
Edges suit kinda has a Joker feel too it. & him cutting his hair is cool. Gotta love heels.
It's Judgement time
Talk to mach
Judgement day 🤨
At least they didn’t name them the new new brood
Boring and the group name sucks!!
Edge and rhea go to the same barber and get the same cut
I really thought edge had a bruise on his head
Damian priest saying that him and edge can take out anyone well call out the top faction right now The Bloodline and see who is going to beat who.
Oh snap, did Edge cut his hair?
I like the name The Saints Of Fate better than The Judgement Day.
Since she joined  edge group  she needs  with new look is vampire  teeth
Vince knows that Edge isn't 100% so he needs some henchmen to keep him from getting hurt.
Judgment day will push Finn to the limit of becoming the demon
Well I'm officially Pro AEW. They have one of the greatest and most surprise returns of all time in someone who was told he would never wrestle again in Edge book him in as the second to last elimination in his royal rumble return have him win the following year's royal rumble take his match from him by adding Daniel Bryan then have a run in on Edge at Summerslam from Seth Rollins which was the only noticeable feud he had since his return besides clashing with Reigns. Then move him to Raw to feud with Miz to cool Edges push down and after winning that he does a call out and low blows AJ Styles for literally no reason. There were no jabs back and forth no story nothing just "hmmp What's up AJ wanna see what your friend Shinsuke Nakamura showed me?" Then pair him up with Damian Priest and Rhia Ripley for no reason this stable is trash this show is trash and his haircut is trash. No thanks.
Rhea Ripley was fit to be in tha movement wit Edge of Judgement Day
I cared edge
I Don't see a Group lead by a Hall of Famer and multiple time world champion is gonna fail, so excited about this. I'm a huge mark
I honestly see Randy orton and Edge feuding again
Brilliant. Edge is awesome
She could do better...
love it now seduce liv to joining
Priest: ALL RISEE RIGHT NOW Me:Alright man calm down I’m up
What a joke...
Dude I'm gonna become a wwe super star I'm joining the judgement day
Why did Edge cut his hair again🤦🏻
This is the vicious side of Rhea I wanted to see.  When I've seen her angry and sadistic facial expressions before, I instantly thought she would be monumental as a top tier cold-blooded heel in the Women's Division.  Something about her has the aura of Jake The Snake Roberts.
Edge cut his hair again.... He looks badass
Love thr group. Hate the name lol
Judgement day wtf is that…. Terminator movie
Lol she's named after a bird
3 international superstars don't care about the WWE fans and universe, they all care about are themselves.
This is like 2006 Edge turned up to 11 and turned to the dark side
She looks more of a man than both of them
Dark Chris Jericho
Judgment Day just went Motionless In White.
Am I the only one that things edge need to stop cutting his hair lol.
What is this straight edge society
Man Edge plays a great heel.
Rhea is a man now
ahhh.. thats some proper heat right there boys. the man has stiiiiil got it. gotta give up to edge being one of the reasons tlc was so dope.
So I'm guessing Tommaso Ciampa Is Next...
My Favorite WWE Wrestlers ❤️ 🔥EDGE😎 Damian🔥🔥Rhea Ripley 🙃🔥😎
NOw get Tommaso Ciampa in this
Since when does Marilyn Manson wrestle?
im more pressed about edge getting rid of his hair
Balor will soon join the faction. Mark my words.
Rhea joined because some autographs got sold?? They really should’ve taken more time with that.
Lol doll 😂😂😂😂😂 Where's doink the clown? Best wrestler of all time, behind gillberg 🤩
I forgot to mention this awhile back when Damian Priest joined Edge. Edge's faction reminds me of Hellraiser. Edge being Pinhead ( Lead Cenobite) and Damian Priest, Rhea Ripley and others soon to join being the Cenobites. A dark feel to this faction
New ministry of darkness
Keep this stable around for a long time please.
Why is edge now a Wish Bray Wyatt?
I would take the "The" out of "The Judgement Day".
Lol Damian the Punishment....Punishment Martinez never left after all
"cause your ugly" 😂 straight to the point. It was so childish I didn't expect it SN: "Judgment Day" sounds better w/o "the".
If this doesn’t lead to the Demon being brought back in full force, it’s gonna be a huge L for Raw
Seeing Edge with short takes me back to 2012
Yes sir Rhea Ripley is with Damian Priest & Edge
Roman reigns should have a haircut 💇 like edge
Edge 🔥
This is wrestling .finally something fresh
Midlife crisis
Did edge cut his hair again 🤔🤔
I’m still waiting for Naomi to join the Bloodline. Hopefully she turns on Sasha Banks soon and joins them. Naomi needs to be a threat to the women’s division as a heel.
Wish a certain peep was still around, but besides that, this has potential to something incredible.
Edge is a great heal but I feel he’s so much better than the cheap heat script of belittling the audience, his promos after he returned and while battling Randy I feel were better
With Rhea working with Edge hopefully Liv will work with AJ and Finn. Both women could benefit greatly from their respective stables.
This reminds of Attitude Era Speech
dang edge cut his hair
This is edge going back to his brood days but amplifying it
He cut his hair lol
forming a faction...nice
Rhea needed to be in Judgement Day with Edge and Damian Priest, this is going to be great for her career. She needs a run where she's with a dominating heel group and she dominates the women's division. I love Edge's promo on the crowd and how Damian Priest told the crowd to rise and I saw the crowd rise too. LOL!
Damien Priest reminds me of the bad guy Van Damme fought in "Cyborg"....LOL
Edge going with that 2012 haircut all over again
Damian priest sounds like his balls finally dropped after joining edge lol.
Edges haircut tho!!
Does Judgement Day really think I care what they say... I don't really care at all... as far as those three  being used they need to remember who (the fans) and what (their merch) pay their bills.
Edge speaking facts tho
Edge is the rudder. Petition to rename group, "The Dutch Rudder"
I was hoping she would join..
I absolutely love that rhea is doing this she doesn’t need anyone holding her back, but herself. She is amazing with or without liv Morgan. I personally think this is a great chance to jump her career up to the next level
Maybe this will finally make her relevant.
He said all rise the people in the crow🤣
I like this 🖤
Wwe you used to be cool.
He cut his hair 🤯
Wait if he said he’s had a surgery EVERYWHERE in his body than does that mean… 🏀🏀
l love this edge 🔥🙌
The Judgement Day vs The Club Liv Morgan joining the group
Priest making people rise was boss level of crowd control
Is this some emo straight edge sociality
kind of reminds me of cm punk's straight edge society faction but how long did that last
Naomi joins the bloodline and we get Bloodline vs Judgement Day
PLEASE WWE Give Rhea her push!! She's a fan favorite and has one of the biggest buzz going right now. She can be just as big as Chyna with the right push 💪
The Shield meets the Wyatt Family. Something different. Yup. Sounds about right. 👍👍
lets see if wwe doesn't ruin this.
She's tired of being used? Yet her only fans is still up
They really just sat here n copied Malikai Blacks entire shtick…wow
Ministry of darkness mixed w straight edge society
They all have the same haircut.
Edge says "You hate it cuz it's true!" 😎
IM LOVIN’ THIS
Yo Edge went off!!!
It’s CM Ripley lol
Edge's new haircut? Yuk
I love this new edge I have been a fan of him my whole life
Yay, another wrestler blaming us the fans for their shortcomings. Edge's right, it is our fault. So we should do is stop giving money to the WWE and start pirating onto YouTube for free. 😆 Since we're the bad guys and all.
Edge  got another haircut
Oh my god everything he saying is factually false.
Edge cut his long hair again
So now AJ and Finn & Liv will team up to go against them at the next ppv
Edges new look 👀 🔥
Definitely a push I love this judgement day faction look out bloodline
I think this will help Rhea's career.
bro whyd edge get that cut😂
Dream booking, add Cody to the Bullet Club. Add Ciampa or someone to Edge’s crew and make it a male trio
Joining this stable Judgement Day will get  Rhea into whole new orbit
Marilyn Manson?
Edge cut his hair again?
They hated Edge for he spoke the truth.
What haircut yall want?? Bold on the sides and keep the hair on top 💯💯
I have the strangest feeling that Edge and Damian will fight RK-Bro one day. Cause I actually love this Edge version of the Brood.
If aj styles and Finn Balor want to even the odds between judgement day they need another female superstar like Bianca belair or liv Morgan by there side
Edge gona make these two superstars
Rhea needs a push as a monster heel. I'm glad she joined Edge's Faction. I'm glad she is getting the creative direction she truly deserves.
The host arena of Wrestlemania 11🔥
I'm not digging were dark and broody  Your local sports team sucks and you're dumb
Put two more people in the group and then it can be a even more dominant faction
Lol I like the idea but they named them after a ppv 🤣
You guys are juks
There promos have Vince written all over it
That has got to be the worst scripted promo I've ever watched in my life....  😴Zzzz
Edge is a legendary n one of a kind in the business. Somebody in wwe gara get trained by edge to make new schools better..
I honestly thought edge was a better promo than just " you people " you people " heat. This faction better go somewhere fast.
This faction is hilarious I love Edge belittling the audience 😂
Have Kevin Owens join Judgment day
And Edge in this new faceta, bringing the talent from Puerto Rico (Damien Priest) and Australia (Rhea Ripley) on this reincarnation of the Brood called Judgement Day is the new era to WWE bring more storylines, and new Shop articles and new fans to this group.
The vibe is like Cm Punk's Straight Edge Society from late 2000's.
The fact edge hasn’t had a championship run since he came back is absurd
Both Rhea Ripley and Damian Priest are going places. I see big things for them this year.
It’s official Edge’s heel is way better than roman I mean Edge is killing it right now
Are they cheering LMAO
Edge cut his hair wow
And these people actually stood up and this is another CM Punk gimmick 😂
Do you think Rhea and Buddy bounce ideas off each, since their stables/factions are carbon copies of one another?
Professional heel work
That judgement day ppv will be lit
Its like the Ministry of Darkness never left Edge.  He just had to tap into it.
Edge plays the perfect heel seriously that’s the best edge the one you love to hate because he’s great and gaining heat and getting heat
Shouldn't have cut the hair. Edge is trying really hard to push over the new talent. He is a true man.
Hold the phone did edge get a haircut???!!!!???
"we don't care" -- the crowd
Rhea is a perfect addition to this faction. I’m loving this new version of Edge.
Hey Rhea.Loved your promo.Especially the part about taking pictures in the airport that get sold on eBay.          Sincerely, 2011 CM Punk.
I like Rhea Ripley, Edge and Damien Priest they are great wrestlers.😀
Been watching WWE  for so many years now , but why put a good match on if there’s always some dumb as coming in and interrupt a good match, up to now there’s been 3 interruptions on tonight’s show. This will be my last viewing of WWE.
People still sell stuff on eBay?
The Judgment Day are dangerous and scary.
I think Edge is making the same group that Gangrel, the proper Edge and his brother Christian formed at the end of the 90's decade, the Brood
Marilyn mansion is now in the wwe 👀
I love the appearance change with these guys too. They all look BADASS this week. I hope they keep that look
what a great stable
Rhea Ripley you always be my favorite one wrestler female 💯☺️🤘 I don't care if you turn Heel you are the best and the greatest wrestler I ever seen you are awesome and you are #1☺️☺️☺️🤘🤘🤘❤️💜💙🖤🖤💚♥️
Rhea Ripley fits this stable like a glove! Nice touch with the Judgment Day tattoo under her eye. I can totally see Finn Balor joining next.
Judgment day vs. new day im callin it 😆😆😆
Straight Edge and why does Rhea look like Chris Motionless
We need the ppv judgement day back now
Bruh what happens to edge hair???
U have judgement day versus the club My thoughts that liv is gonna joining aj styles and finn balor to be part of mandatory group
edge the kevin samuels of wrestling
Good Gosh Rhea Ripley mic skills ain't it bruhhhh it's not it 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Not feelimg it yet
Wwe used to be so simple now you got all this teaming and extra bullcrap
I like this faction!!! So far! 💯💯💯💯💯
Terminator 2 Edge Faction
Edge is a better heel than face.  This is how he should be.  Boost up the new blood.
i like edge hair cut tho its on point 💯
I miss Rhea with long hair and all that but this version is enjoyable. I like the darker look.
Welcome to the judgment day
2 of the ugliest men in the wwe. Damien priest is cool tho
This gimmick makes no sense to me most of the stuff he said wasn't true. He was by far the most beloved baby face after his return.
Rhea Ripley look like total badass lady in this group
Edge got a new cut!
Demon Balor would be lit in this faction
Edge cut his hair
Judgement Day vs The Club I'm guessing Liv Morgan will be a honorary member
It would be funny if Finn turn against AJ and join edge
edge looks like a foot calling people ugly
Buddy Murphy is on HOB,, now his GF is on the backwash version.. "judgment day" 🤣🤣💀 Good grief
This New Edge is something WWE needs The Ultimate Opportuniest is back, but I'm not so sure of Reha Ripley looks like she barely has A mean streak , We shall See,    Edge Sounds like he could be A good Preacher for Church
CHRISTAIN CAGE IS BETTER THEN YOU
Rhea ripley not cute at all
Damion voice got deeper since he joined with edge 😂😂😂
Edge is my all time favorite wrestler hes great at either being a babyface or a heel
I'm really getting Straight Edge Society vibes to this group
Cutting his hair was a mistake
So they named their faction after a wwe ppv?
I’m always surprised when Damien speaks because I always forget how powerful his voice is
i still say rhea looks like the lead singer of motionless in white with that makeup! LOL!
I'm sure keyboard warriors will be really upset about this
I'm sorry but edge you look weird with short hair.  There's my keyboard warrior comment
Edge love the group  Love the music   The haircut though is trash
This is so Disney
We need champa to join them next
Please have Tommaso Ciampa join Judgement Day.
This is what Rhea needed. Most needed.
Perfect opportunity to the Undertaker to make a return, he did say "never say never" 👀
I can’t wait for Cena to come back to feud  with Edge and Judgment Day
Barber: What do you want? Edge: Give me the Rhea Ripley Barber: Say no more, fam.
The new brood
I love this version of edge.
Typical “grrr I hate the fans” heel promo. Come on wwe. I like the group but give them more original motives. And edge saying no one cared is just a lie and ignorant
Rhea Ripley joined judgement day cause you dam kids used her for her autograph (shaking fist emoji)
How to join The Wyatt Family: Grow a beard. How to join Judgement Day: Have the same haircut. Boy, I wonder what Ciampa's gonna do when he joins.
The Judgment Day are a sick, twisted three-headed monster.
Is the 'The' really necessary? Just call them Judgement Day.
The Judgment Day are dangerously scary.
Lmfao he called them keyboard warriors
Given the chance, I would have Rhea sign, my arm, chest, whatever, and then go have it tatted to make it permanent, absolutely adore everything about her, and Judgment day looks good on her!  Thank you Edge!
Great that Rhea Ripley joined Judgement Day . Hope it will revive her career
Edge cuts his hair again? He did the same last year in 2015, but Let's be honest, I don't know what it is, Edge did great Turn Heel. I didn't know Rhea Ripley join Forces the Judgement Day. They need to bring WWE Judgement Day 2004 back.
Rhea Ripley vs Bianca Belair will be more banger
Is Rhea Ripley real uptight or extremely uptight
I knew it
Um….yeah the fans cared.  Lol
What are your thoughts on Rhea Ripley joining Edge and Damian Priest?
