Are you watching it with y'all?😂😂 And congratulations on your marriage!❤ Y'all are epic. Just crazy. Time flys by Y'all did such a great job of catching it❤. Oh and beautiful steps. How much you walked around in the beautiful dress? Just gorgeous! Y'all nailed it. Hope, love and happiness. So cool. Hey happy Safe  Adventures
Tofu!!!!!!!! The absolute worst thing you can eat if you have estrogen fed breast cancer is.........TOFU!
Ugh! Tofu is one of the worst things a breast cancer patient can eat! It has estrogen!
Good evening Eamon & Bec, Just wanted to let you know that we're pretty sure that we saw our dog eat a rock on one of our walks; he definitely eats grass that he pulls up with his teeth, and even though he's on a lead when we take him for walks he still manages to quickly grab a twig/small stick or a seed of some sort that's fallen off a tree. He was a rescue dog, and I think that this is how he survived all those years of being tied up to a fence and neglected.
Eamon dropping the onion 😂
It's wild how these two live under the total delusion that the way they eat is healthy. Soy, constant carbs and trashy frankenstein foods. Seriously what is up with the world.
wow  I just recognized Westport Home Hardware.  Are you on the Rideau System?
❤ peaceful folks
Soy is the worst possible food ever for Bec! It is loaded with estrogen!
My german shepered did i was told its a lack of salt in there diet Just let u know thats how i found out Love u two"s vido Like your new home😊
Just came to say I made oatmeal your way today and now I can't have it aby other way❤
I’m sure you’ve been told, but I can’t help but think of how much you look like Millie Bobby Brown
Arnt u doing videos anymore? Miss seeing them!
I can't believe eamonn went to the shop to buy the stones, came back dug up the path laid the path with sand and then cooked dinner all in one day and theres men out there that say they they'retoo tired from their 9 to 5 to wash one plate!! HE IS THE STANDARD
I miss your Sunday videos
Wait are y’all still vegan? Or are y’all vegetarian I forgot
YOU TWO WILL BE THE BEST PARENTS  LOVE AND CARE FOR YOU 4 LOL DIANE ONTARIO CANADA
Bec’s a country girl 😊
Bec, I know you want to help, but you’ve got your baby inside you, my wife was the same a week before we had our daughter she helped me remove 8 tonnes of concrete from our old patio
Did you find a good group that you can recommend on Betterhelp I can’t seem to find a breastcancer group.. or similar
Your guys are going to be great parents
You are going such great Parents
Hope u all r doing well.how’s the baby doing. Please let us know how u r doing. Just worried back here in Virginia
Did  this couple quit videos
“food, shelter, and se-“ HAD ME DYYINNGGG 🤣🤣
Recently, I came across your video on YouTube. Love to watch you and Eamon. Saw the video on which you were discussing the names for the baby girl. Since you both love nature, how about Nature Rose?
Hi Bec!✨ I’m a fan✨ and I just want to say, that I✨ hope your baby is going to be a✨ wonderful thing in your life ☺✨
Jeg har lige fundet ud af you are cancer free trøjer når i have fødselsdag i mig
Did Bec give birth? Is that why you haven't posted in three weeks?!
By the way I think you to will be great parents
Check out fertility and carnivore .Dr Barry has in his evidence based practice direct cause in conception with vegan diets 😢. I’m sorry . I recently started this carnivore journey and it’s not easy because in general I’ve never like meat for a Miriam of reasons. In researching I have uncovered a lot about the harm  in a mostly vegetarian or vegan diet ! The enzymes that your ancestors relied on to produce makes sense now!
Congrats on everything but I've just gotta ask... Are y'all not vegan anymore? Dairy and Honey items. Did you change for your pregnancy?
Stretch marks coconut oil is the best I don't have not 1 mark of my body today I have 3 babies and I still look good All the best with your pregnancy and your family
Maam take care of your self,and ur baby.. my sister die in breast cancer complication,
please swap peanut butter for another nut butter, peanuts when stored create a mould and the mould causes cancer, as per Barbara Oneil
Because is so right honey is SOO good for doggies. Helps digestion, throat irritants, helps the fur it’s crazy all the benefits. Also I just wanted to say yall are an AMAZING INSPIRING couple! I can’t wait for all the amazing things that are sure to come yalls way! 🤍💛🧡🤎
0:08 into
Bec.. I had the same problems when I was pregnant with my first.. if you have a yoga ball sitting on it and rolling your hips in a circle takes some pressure off(your back as well).. it’s an old wives tale but I swear by it and suggested this to friends who it also helps.. eating bananas! I would wake up screaming it felt like my lower legs were being sawed off.. so I started eating a banana for bed and drinking a lot more water! Swimming def will help
you being a trans you would kill the baby
once a trans always a trans
i say the same thing about my cousin being a dragonfly :) glad you're doing well x
I heard crazy horse doesn’t like cameras also 🧐
I had 4 children who are now all grown and now having their 5:35 own babies 3 sons and a daughter
seeing Eamon love you so unconditionally is so heartwarming. you guys are just a beautiful couple!
Bec, not sure about dogs; but babies cannot have honey.  It turns to botulism
You’re being more like him because you’re carrying a part of him Inside you. Like when Bella wanted raw meat
You shouldnt be jumping in the water like that and watch your sugar intake if your pregnant even the healthiest preggo women get pregnancy diabetes
Seeing you guys have me goosebumps. I have been a huge fan for years and I’m so happy for you guys. I want to cry ❤
18:47 cute
The two are you are amazing people and this baby is blessed. As always wishing your family the best.
DEFINITELY A BOY!! Your carrying center, and that is classic boy pregnancy. If you were much more rounded - that would be a girl. Congratulations regardless!!!! So enjoy watching your milestones!
Toronto? Did l miss something? Beck you look amazing ❤
I just love you guys! You make my day so much better!!!
You need to plant wild thyme between the step-stones on your new pathway 💚 there are some that survive even frosty winters AND its the greatest to smell fresh thyme while walking (my wife did so in our garden and i love it!). https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thymus_serpyllum
I just finished watching the latest vlog. I havnt LAUGHED so much when Bec was pissing herself when she was eating cereal on the couch laughing. I LOVE YOU GUYS - SO NATURAL.  Enjoy your journey - its PRICLESS.
You guys are amazing and Bec you look so adorable..oh wow!  You guys have Whittaker's Chocolate sll the way from Aotearoa /New Zealand ❤❤
Are you afraid of bears on your walk? I mean are they around your place? U look incredible Bec. Pregnancy suits you
You have amazing features bec.
You folks are beautiful! Im praying for your your recovery bec.
Within the first 30 seconds I feel such profound love for you guys. I hope you feel it from all of us. ❤
Wait they’re moving to Toronto!? Did I miss something!?
Bec is going thru what young women go thru and why by 40yrs their character is REAL and sexy as hell
You two must come from amazingly supportive families because you are both so supportive of each other and up beat!🩷
I think a good name for baby girl would be Jazzy or Jazz
Maybe you should begin teaching the dog to flopping on the bed isn't a good thing with a little baby in your bed. And you might say the baby won't sleep in your bed but just you wait and see.
Anyone know how we can send small gifts for the baby? Do they have a PO box?
Such a wonderful video. Also the Audi change during swimming was AMAZING
saw pics of you guys w a baby in this video!!
So happy to see how your both thriving!  I’d rather my Dog eating rocks than their poo!!!! Bec you look wonderful…. And I’m loving your butter colored synchilla on you!!!
“She’s gonna be a tractor driver before she has her license” 🤔 this could be a country song
I am absolutely in tears. I love watching your guys journey you deserve so much :') huge congratulations. I've been here since the covid days and your vulnerability with us is amazing. I am so so so happy for you guys :') congratulations again!!!!
BABY NAME ... Sunshine Lee  CONGRATS!
I was such a sweet person 3rd trimester. My lucky charms addiction was concerning 2-3 bowls a day. And I was due Christmas Eve so once little Debbie released those Christmas tree cakes, I was keeping in my car. But after birth, it didn’t stick around. When I got in my car after 6 weeks I had forgot about the tree cakes at all and threw away. And I haven’t had lucky charms at all.
Omgggg bec i love u so much can't wait to see the baby ❤❤❤
Actually Eamon SHE CAN BLAME EVERYTHING ON THE PREGNANCY!!!! Hahaha her Whole!! Body is changing, and the hormones… cmon 😂😂😂
try IVORY soap in your sheets for Cramping!!!!  look it up... works amazing for me.. no idea why...Give it a try!
my dog does not liek camera either
Oil your hips too. I had stretch marks on my hips!
Baby girl name: Wren🙂👶
pregnacy pillow can be good to hips and back pain
My wife and I have tried to have a baby for 6 1/2 years, 4 days before we were to go to our first IVF appt she got a positive test!  She is now 9 weeks pregnant!
Love this caption of your family coming in 3 soon
I also had horrible leg cramps in the middle of the night with my first pregnancy (they are no fun!). Ask your midwive/OB about magnesium supplementation. I've been told while pregnant, mineral deficiencies are super common. Love your videos! Your cabin is so dreamy and you two are going to make great parents : )
Not rocks but my dog loves glass. My boyfriend and I adopted a bloodhound about when we moved to the mountains.  We live also in the middle of nowhere and we when we first came to this house there was just a mess everywhere. One day we were in a huge fight about something in the house renovation going wrong, so my boyfriend came up with the idea to break the glass as exercise to release anger. Fun at the time but a pain to clean, so we kind of just stared at it for about a month. Until one day I kept calling my doggie inside and she wouldn't come. I just thought she was out in the woods, so I went out to the trail to find her. After like an hour I came back and saw her at the building trying to eat the glass. Needless to say we cleaned up the glass the next day, but the whole time she was looking at us like we were taking away the love of her life.
I can't help but notice a couple of the sweet snacks Eamon pulled out weren't vegan, what's going on there? 🥺
So happy for you both or should I say all THREE of you. Didn't even know this was possible after your treatments but you two are so amazing you deserve to live on in a child. Lucky kid.
canada has turtles?????
I always really enjoyed your videos before, so fun that we are only a couple weeks apart!!
Bec, chiropractic adjustment helps with your sciatic. So helpful. My bestie is a doula and her hubby is a chiro and it’s common practice in the natural birth community to get adjusted before birth while in labor early.   And freeze the adult diapers fit post birth. Praying for you
That question, “so what do you wanna do today?” That’s what I want, to be able to choose and not have to!
YOUR AMAZING BEC!!
Watching The Bear much? 😂
Eamon’s beautiful recognition of women in pregnancy and just overall how incredible us women are…. Just stunning to hear from a man.   Let’s make sure more men hear men say beautiful truths like this about women in their lives or women in general. Definitely need more love in this world.   Thank you sooooo much to Bec & Eamon for continuing to invite us into their world ❤💓❤️
When are y’all moving to Canada?
For calf pain elevated your legs take turns and sleep wit something between your legs first time mom to a first time mom 🖤
Omg my mom is literally in labor right noww it’s so cool to see that so many other people are feeling the exact same things as her!!!
Probably should have screwed the roofing on the ribs not in the centre and put some steel and motar on the bricks
Congratulations ❤❤❤❤
Eamon is really a great handyman and a very hard worker. It is amazing what you have done with your property.
You literally are living in paradise.
Did you know, I’m so bloody proud of both of you, if I could be 50% of the people you are I’d be ecstatic! You both deserve the world and more!
Hey real/fake. Hahaha . I loved your mini tractor, how much did you pay for it? I want one!
Did you guys stop being vegan/plant based or are mini eggs vegan in Canada??
A lot got done.  You guys' ROCK !   Thumbs up and love from S. California.
Wait you’re moving to Toronto?? What episode did I miss?
Eamon and Bec two incredible people showing how to make their life worth to live intelligently. Always thank God
Those rocks are terrible for him, check his poop for disposal they are most likely in his stomach and might require surgical removal.  Twice we have had to have our dog’s stomach cleaned out, five pounds of blanket the last time . He is such a good dog, what breed is he.  Love you guys.
Bec is glowing and she looks so beautiful pregnant!
Try to relax together as much as possible. Even meditate and it will help relieve the pressure on your body. The dog position 30 minutes a day helps also. From 5 pregnancies❤🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉 I'm so excited. And I just can't fight it🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉 I'm so excited to see y'all's journey🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Wow you beat cancer, nice!
Is everything ok guys as it’s been 12 days since u uploaded just want to send my love
Love you two another smile filled journey.  Blessings for you three oh and Ohso too ;-)
Hold up, is Bec eating non-vegan chocolate?!   Inside Babies are so demanding with their food cravings hahahaha.    You guys work so hard, and Bec, you look fantastic!
Move to Toronto?
Your videos bring such joy to my day! Thank you for being vulnerable and brave enough to share a piece of your life with us! BTW, Bec, where is that gorgeous necklace you are wearing from? The one you were wearing while talking about Better Help? Thanks and love you both! xoxo
I call my fella hunny bun! 😂😂 my name is Suzanne and he calls me Suzie Wong( it’s a nickname my dad used to call me as a child when I wore my favourite hHong Kong Fooey pyjamas 😂) and he loved how cute it was and all my godchildren and friends call me Wong too! Oozie Wong was my godchild’s first words! ❤ parents weren’t happy I love pet names!
❤
I know people will be mad, but for loneliness, I recommend Jesus. Contrary to what most people say. Jesus is the best thing in a human's life. You rarely see a Christian feeling lonely.  If you don't believe me try yourself. Read the Bible starting from Mathew. You will love Jesus' biography.  God bless
I love u bec❤❤
Congratulations
I’m due within a day of you, also with a baby girl (after two boys who are now 8 & 10). This pregnancy hasn’t been easy, but I love the feeling of her moving around and how my body is changing.
You look amazing Bec. Love your new walkway and your Chef makes a mean curry. 👍❤
Man, I'm so happy and excited for you guys! You deserve this time to enjoy this and move forward in life on a happy journey.
I’ve got news for you Eamon, she can blame it on whatever the hell she wants! Especially pregnancy brain!! IT IS VERY LIKELY EXACTLY THAT!
I’m 23 weeks this Saturday! Love to be on this journey with you
Just found your channel, you two make me smile, looking forward to watching your earlier videos. Congrats on your pregnancy!
How long is the plan to stay in Toronto?  As for Oso chewing rocks our dog did this as well. Sometimes, it can be due to Pica.
LOL  every thing that Oso does get a "ohhhhhhh3 from Bec hehe!!
I'm sorry but the deer peeing part. EPIC! I love your life but that killed me! 😅😂😅😂
👍❤️
I had those leg cramps and they were awful! Search for "vitamin that helps leg cramps". I'd tell you if i could remember,  but it's been 45 years,  so...😂
I had a dog that ate rocks
Not Eamon saving an invasive snapping turtle 💀
Great video! a few things... Thank you so much for helping that snapping turtle across the road but that is not the best way to hold them-you can hurt your fingers. It is best to grab them at the back of the shell and work your forearms. Also! if you are moving to Toronto- I work at Rouge national urban park and the northern part of it is really nice, I would love to give you guys a map and or show you around :)
❤
Thank you for welcoming us into your adventures and letting us carry part of the heavy loads life can bring. Your creativity, drive and spunk are a delight. You’re gonna make for some way cool fun parents. Many blessings
I have been a midwife for better part of 25 years - Magnesium Citrate - can come in a pleasant dissolving powder (Natural Vitality is one that makes it) and works wonders for night calf cramps
13 weeks pregnant with a girl and still nauseous! 🙃
What skin care do you use Bec?! 😍
Pregnant here too! 14 weed and love watching your updates!
What happened to "see you Sunday"? :-(
Hey I I don’t know why p y’all dint upload but we can wait. I don’t know if y’all fell behind on wading or if y’all are going through a rough time, but since I have been watching seice 2019 I know y’all will make it through this and what ever is yet to come just I see you do it in the past. Love the vid love y’all.
My boy is 8 months old and I just got a autoimmune diagnosis and even though my pregnancy was soo hard  worth every bit of it❤❤
Mother of 2... I HOPE u don't get the lightening bolt stabs/shocks  in the vagina. So many women do and Jesus it's miserable!
bec can use pregnancy brain for 2yrs after birth, growing a human changes your brain
I would watch y’all do anything!
So exciting! Happy for you guys. What a gift to you both after such a hard year! My husband and I are having our rainbow baby REAL soon. We experienced a miscarriage October of last year, so a baby one year later is pretty redemptive. (Our baby boy is due this Saturday!) Planning on an all natural birth at a midwife birth center. Its such a strange thing to imagine our baby outside of me! It's really hitting me in an unexpected way that soon he will just be outside of me. He's just so settled in there and he's going to be uprooted and people can hold him and I can't protect him in the same way ever again. Such a weird thought! But still exciting:) Wishing you the best.
Lookin’ great Bec!!
https://youtu.be/VIR46oH-ufk?si=yi2lffnVqN42FKOS
I love you two. Um three...no, make that four!!! Can't leave Oso out!  I just saw this headline on CNN, and thought you should be aware. I don't like fear-mongering, but with a Little One arriving, you might want to know this. Giant hugs! "All Onewheel electric skateboards recalled after four deaths and multiple injuries reported".
I have a 6 mo old and by far the thing I hated most was how swollen my face, hands, legs were. I didn't look like myself at all. It went away within a week of delivery and I felt so much better. I was fortunate to not have any real pain though which was good as I was doing my job as an emergency physician up until the day before she was born.
Looks gorgeous 😍
I just went through a year of breast cancer, not sure if I’ll ever be able to get pregnant… so so so happy for you guys❤
Bec you are such a beautiful soul ! strong, sweet, you are gonna be a wonderful mum !!! sending all my love from Italy, ps guys if you wanna come in Tuscany you are welcome !!!
oh this is so exciting!!! congrats! I remember those pelvic and hip pains. they are completely normal but ouchy fo sho.
My son is 7 weeks old now, but pregnancy was such an incredible experience and I loved it.
Ooh rub that stuff on your lower back too it helps the skin stretch all around and prevents stretch marks on the love handles and lower back.
My cravings where silk soy chocolate milk and freezies or any type of popsicle lol😂
Whatever the food was that Eamon threw together, looked really good… Almost makes me want to become a vegetarian, almost.😊👍🏼
I need my vid from y’all what happen
You two work so hard and have made such a beautiful home and beautiful life
You can get in your hot tub if you turn the temperature down
You guys have come along way, and that’s amazing to see your progress through your videos… Best wishes to you and your upcoming new baby girl! Can’t wait for that one!
I thinks dogs eat rocks for minerals lol you should feed him some fresh wet food along with his dry
God bless. Back at you!  Glad everything is going well.. you both are glowing!! So exciting!! And quite a few ups and downs the past year and a half. You should be so proud of yourselves. This little girl clearly chose you and wants to be here, as your baby girl!
I call our dog hunny bunny 😂.....she also eats rocks 😂🤷🤦
Can you please make Eamon try Bec’s weird pregnancy cravings
congradulations....    her hair is looking good... that means kidneys are  working   .... yea ....
I  had 4 screamers.  I think it could mean that he is more sensitive and vocal.  My daughter was the quietest and is the more introvert of the family.
What happened to see you Sunday....slackers
Hi Eamon and Bec i just recently watched the video "for lee💛" and i was thinking you guys should use Lee maybe as baby girls middle name so you would always have it to remeber
The  cooking segement was funny
Had my 2 girls 50 odd years ago, you met me and the youngest one and her 2 sons at the vegefest in London some years ago.  Pregnancy is something you never forget or the birth and you end up with these gorgeous little babies who grow up to be mothers themselves and then their children grow up and give you great grandchildren. I have 7 of them all adorable 😊 🥰 you won’t believe the love you have for them all 🥰
Oso wasn't technically over the line !
Happy to see you are all doing so well and the baby is growing in Mommy's tummy nicely. As always sending vibes of Blessings and Love for your continued adventures on your journey through this life together. Can't wait to see baby girl, the time will go by fast.
Watching your videos in the cabin always has me hoping the previous owners are also watching and seeing the love you’ve poured into your home over the last few years. You both are the best ❤
I feel like I missed something…you all are moving to Toronto?
I started watching you two in 2020 and I LOVE you, I have to laugh that you have no idea who I am but I feel we are great friends. This video was so beautiful, you two are rockin' da life. Super excited to meet your beautiful baby girl soon. Thank you for your awesomeness and FUN! I make curry in a very similar way, Eamon. Yummmm!!!❤️💜👏🩷
Eamon saying "To be a man... To be a man" after the Barbie clips made me laugh out loud
34 weeks here and cried my eyes out when I red the big news from you guys. 😊  I still feel tired and in the middle of a house reno haha.
Please do an updated cabin tour before y’all move!!
New woman , you'll get a huge cell building boost...after giving birth..you are supposed to be resting more...your growing a life. Enjoy today
Hi, I’m new to your channel and love what I have seen so far! Love where you live so much. I will know watch your channel from the beginning! 💕
Please dont give the bby a vegan diet. Feed him!
Love the chef sequence
baby name rec: naming your baby girl after lee!! or something that incorporates lee’s name in it, you can see how much lee means to both of you and i think it would be an great way to honor her!! 🫶 14:46
21:08 oil on the hips!
Great path front front door to back door.  Bec you are looking great.  Take care, Dan and I are sending our love.
The kiss in the water ❤❤❤
food shelter and s*x XDD Got me rolling on the floor loll 😂
You're pretty much experiencing what I did about 20 years ago. I had cancer in 2001 and then finished up all treatment by the end of 2002. Got a clean bill of health and then a few months later I was pregnant. My husband and I, btw, were told on two separate occasions that we were infertile. Guess not! lol. But I went from constantly worrying and going through all the side effects of the chemo and radiation and even a stem cell transplant-- all those doctor's appointments that hammered an enduring anxiety in me to feeling on top of the world. The body is truly resilient, as you said. I was pregnant, I felt great and I delivered a healthy baby girl into this world in 2004. She's now in college. <3 After all I'd been through, I cried because I never thought I'd be able to have a child and I'm so glad I did. I'm happy you get to experience that, too. <3 <3 <3
It’s kinda crazy to think about the fact that I’ve been following you guys for 5 years… 😭 I got married, had a baby who’s now 2.5, followed your van life, your stuck in Morocco Covid episode, your cabin renovations, the cancer journey and now your pregnancy… man… it feels like we’re doing Life together. It’s really special.
I just want to write a few things on here. Beautiful ones. You guys have so much impact on the community! Especially for me. Seen you both on these phase, it compels me to keep noting my current moments. To look back at them with care. Thank you for making videos! ❤️ believe it or not you guys make a difference! For that, Gracias!
I’ve been watching a lot of Canadians lately and meeting them and I am totally in love with you guys. You’re so much fun you’re so nice polite and kind. I live in South Florida, and have most of my life but I’ve only met French Canadians. Very different people.  I am learning so much about pregnancy because I never was able to get pregnant and didn’t want to at the time and then they caught cervical cancer in time and that choice was taken away from me. Now I understand why a woman’s rear end gets so huge. Her pelvis her hips spread to make room for the baby. I feel so stupid. I didn’t know that at 71. Wow women are fantastic. But I adore male friends. ❤ you guys are wonderful to watch. Thanks so much.
Moving to TO? I missed a vid somewhere haha
Oso is gonna be a great big brother and the best protector of his world❤❤
Put the Oreos in the freezer. Trust me.
😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅
Congrat for 6 months just relax more no stress be happpy  I'm a mother of 13 kid ages 16 to 2 yrs old Husband just turned 60 and me 33 from Australia sailing to Spain
Bec looks so gorgeous pregnant!! And I can feel her joy and confidence radiate through the screen. Love to see it!
19:45 bec! Calcium & magnesium help with the calf cramps too! I liked natural calm’s with calcium drink mix and found it helpful 😊
I did not get the part bec said they are moving to toronto?
Watched you guys while pregnant and was thrilled to hear you were having a baby! We didn’t know what we were having, and 3 weeks ago I gave birth to a beautiful baby girl 🥰  I’m so excited for this journey you are on!
Its been a while since i watched one of your vids. Im an OG follower, I had no idea what you have been through! Congrats on you getting through all of this x!
Congratulations mommy!
I love being pregnant its such a happy feeling despite all the pain but of course twice is enough w
New sub 👍
Love you guys!
You should do a updated cabin tour
Hello 😊😊 we are very happy for you.. we are “Abuelos sin Rumbo” means Grandparents without Destination 😊😊 we want to meet you if not is problem for you,  we drove from Guadalajara Mexico to Alaska and now we are crossing all Canada and we are in Montreal, if you can give us the opportunity to see you let us know and we really appreciate your answer, we can go wherever you say 😅 thanks a lot and congratulations again ❤
Can’t wait to find out baby girl name ❤
So good! Cheers Lee. 😇😇💜 So my Memee’s middle name was Lee. My dogs are LEEvy and LucEE. Do you get it? Lol. So much love to you 4. Aww, Oso is the best. Yes! Get in the water 🔥💪😊
Love you guys , thanks for sharing your lives with us 🎉
I don't  believe in cravings no such thing the women wants to eat these  things because she is pregnant  and uses cravings as excuse to eat
Love where you guys are at considering the year you just had 💪🏽🙏🏼🥰 congrats
Your dog eating rocks is most likely a cause of a nutritional deficiency. Try adding another source of animal protein in wet form food, that should help
23 weeks ❤
Hold on…y’all are moving? Just kinda threw that in there at 20:28, did I miss something??
Gosh I can't believe I started watching when you two were van lifing...now your having a family!
I haven't watched one of your videos in a while and wow I can't believe you are already 6 months pregnant! When I see your video, I get homesick as you are literally shopping in my home town. All the best!
Might have to get a divider for the backseat to the boot once baby is here 😂 otherwise so be slobbering over the baby 😂
OMG U HAVE 3 MONTHS LEFT 🎉🎉
When Eamon sneezed you say "bless you" in german as if he is right in front listening haha great laugh!!!😂😂
does the dog oso hears the baby or comes to you to listen to her? he will make a great baby carer!!!
Why are you guys moving to Toronto?! Will you be selling the cabin? Sending good vibes ! 🎉
I have a theory that the smarter your baby is the worse the pregnancy brain 🤣  I remember all those feelings and my baby is 38.  Enjoy your experience
bec is such an inspiration to me like she’s so strong and no matter what she keeps her head up and keeps going and we all love how supportive eamon has been
I hope your baby will be happy and healthy
❤
Obturator hernia is what its called.  Pain was God awful.
O rings on each inner thigh hip where all the ligaments and muscle run from the upper thigh to the pelvis was the worst pain in the world.  I literally couldn't get up it was burning as the womb stretched.  I never want to have pain like that again .
Bet you had a long journey you had breast cancer and nothing to you later you having a baby wow you guys are spying me so much
I love your guises videos
Being pregnant and having babies is the best! I've had 3 babies and leg cramps and feeling like my pelvis was being torn apart was part of that UNTIL a doctor told me I needed to take a calcium/ magnesium supplement. Make sure to take more so that when it comes time to have the baby you'll be in less pain as well. The cramps got so bad that when it was time to push, I couldn't pull my legs up and a nurse and my husband had to massage my thighs so I could bring my legs up. The Shaklee brand was the best. All the best to you! In a short few weeks your life will never be the same, only better!
Please be careful with Oso eating rocks, we've had a situation where a dog got a stone stuck in her intestine and it had to be surgically removed...😅
Moving to Toronto? What have I missed? I’m sure I’ve seen them all!
these videos are so underrated ! loved the content, bring it in
Last 3-4 episode of Eamon and Bec videos are like grown up Bob the builder episodes  Not complaining tho ❤
And I’m a’thinkin to myself.. there’s absolutely no way that’s going to be enough stones for your walkway! 😂
💕🫂🪷you’re incredible and beautiful and are already a fabulous mum Bec❣️🌷 P.s. yes The hip discomfort at this point is super painful at times for myself but some not so much but it is a Very Positive sign I need that your level of “Relaxin” the hormone that loosens joints and such to prepare for the most streamlined birthing physically anatomically is great❣️ Ask your doctor ALWAYS, but resting with a heating pad on low even was one of my best buddies and then also a Magic Bag™️ that is a grain in a lovely cover put in microwave and then spread on painful areas helped a whole bunch❣️  Your vlogs are great and I so enjoy your personalities and interactions between both of you and friends and Oso etc.  it’s lovely to see the goodness you are experiencing in your life currently after the fear and sickness ETC…that you beat the crud out of dear Bec🩷 The times ahead are going to be filled with actual wonder!!  I’m also relieved to know that when you felt ready and in need of therapy support that you did that for yourself 🩷. It took me til I had my wee one and he was a few months before I felt enough courage to reach out and seek for professional support and such for your innermost thoughts and feelings.  Pregnancy is a huge trip!! And it can be perfect from start to finish as far as things medically etc but it’s still the most odd, pretty time consuming, physically demanding even if your morning sickness is very mild…..there’s a new thing to adjust to continuously and days sometimes can have a series of things changing rapidly that again, even if not “negative”, can still be lots to process through the fatigue nearly all of us get and then add on working inside or outside home, marriage, fur babies, oh there is just so much❣️ But it’s usually the most out of this world experience and changes us and our partners in magical ways for lack of a better word/explanation 😉❤🪷, sincerely, Kimberly.
That such a big diff in a year bec, n anytime u ever feel like u cant keep going on with life u better remember everything u over came n remind urself u can beat and take on more then majority people cant even imagine n have not ever had to experience. It may not be as bad as some but it for sure is more then bad for most, n its just a way of life telling n proving to urself ur stronger then u give urself credit for. Congrats on the baby to u both
As I’m running around, doing housework, and listening vs watching I can’t stop thinking you and Kara sound a lot alike!
So happy for you you’re glowing Bec 🩵 where are your nice dresses from that you wore to all the weddings? 😍
It's been such a Joy watching your belly grow a little human 💕 I still pray for you asking God to bless you with a healthy baby.
Oh goodness 😂 I need that on a T-shirt Food shelter and s*x
I’ve been saving this video for a day like today when I’m overwhelmed and need to relax in the tub and try to chill out. Thank you guys for always having such calm energy. Really needed it today ❤
It’s been fun
I would love to see Kara and Nate on this channel again.
FYI, your blocks are too far apart, bro!
Enjoy the extra hours of sleep now.
Why would anyone want to live anywhere else? Toronto sounds awful!
So freaking excited for this next chapter !!!! ❤❤❤
LOL…on the first day of kindergarten the teacher asked my extremely shy daughter what her name was. When she didn’t respond the teacher gave her a hint by saying what’s your mama call you? My daughter replied proudly, “Honey”! ❤️🥰
Dogs love carrots also..slice them.. Congratulations on having a baby..🇺🇸❤️🌹
Becs.. The only woman that's ever been pregnant
that gorgeous montage that ended with the peeing (??) deer and straw sounds was everything. height of cinematography.
I have great news my test came back negative not breast cancer.
Im so happy and excited for you guys ❤
Random baby name suggestion, and maybe you already have baby names picked out. But, throwing it out here anyway. You said Lee always shows up as a dragonfly. Dragonfly in french is libellule, in italian: libellula, in spanish:  libelula etc. A name such as libellula or lulla would be a beautiful name for a little girl and could honour lee in a subtle way, as well as all the travels you have done throughout your years. <3
Oh gosh, I can’t stop my dog eating rocks, he’ll wreck his teeth one day
Congratulations for your pregnancy and may you always be and stay healthy ❤
I have to tell you pregnancy brains can be bad. I swear I gave my baby 50% of my brain power and got back 25% after a while.  What do you think about using three or four across on the other side?
NO SOY. NO SOY NO SOY IT'S ESTROGENIC & GMO
Ha ha the deer scene —- I love it!!🌞😎💯
My little one is asleep on my chest and about to turn 6 months
Will you force your kid to be vegan, or will you let him/her decide for him-/herself when it get old enough to decide for itself?
So so happy for you both 🥰
You are making more videos and it’s terrific! Love you guys. I am 76 and currently going through chemotherapy and I so appreciate watching the two of you. It also helped when I was diagnosed in June to watch Bec’s cancer journey. I am now bald and can’t wait to have my hair grow back. I have HER2 which is an extremely aggressive form of breast cancer so I will soon start Herceptin infusions for 15 months and then radiation. I was so happy for you when you discovered that you were pregnant and no longer had cancer. Your little girl has chosen two really wonderful people to be her parents!,
I had a miscarriage 7 years ago and never tried again! These videos help me realize that no matter what, I have an angel baby. Thank you for sharing your journey Bec. Thank the both of you!
I LEGIT love the both of you like family!
Yes!my dumb shi-tzu will eat rocks. Actually it’s leftover shells from our parking area which is now pavers,but if you stand around he’ll find one and you’ll hear it clacking around on his teeth🙄
Congratulations
Just because you know how much of a blessing this baby is and no matter how thankful you feel or how much you may worry about other women who can’t experience pregnancy. DOES NOT INVALIDATE YOUR FEELINGS AND EMOTIONS! It doesn’t mean you can’t be miserable at times or absolutely exhausted, and it doesn’t mean you can’t complain and express those things. Doing so does not make you ungrateful or selfish. It makes you HUMAN! So let it out momma! Then get back to completely absorbing every moment 😍😍
I remember being surprised by the mental challenges of pregnancy too, though I thought mine was because I was going it alone and during a pandemic. I'm glad you have the therapy you need after the last few rough years. So excited for you guys!
Love you guys ... thank you for sharing yourselves with us. x
You look wonderful!
Wait! You’re moving to Toronto? How’d I miss that news? Are you selling your place?
What do you mean “ move to Toronto?”
Why are you moving?
Baby is a"growing!  Great paving stone landscaping!  OSO was such a big help.  Enjoyed your segment, as usual. 3 months to go. You get up a lot at night to potty which prepares you for the approaching lack of sleep when "Baby Girl" wants to be fed or changed at all hours of the day or night.  Of course Eamon will share this job.  Enjoy your calm mealtime now as that is about to change forever, for the best experience of your lives!!!
God bless you all, try to get as much sleep as you can before the baby comes!
Sweet video thanks!
Best part about swimming pregnant is being a human submarine.
You got this bec!! Just wanted to suggest seeing a pelvic floor specialist and/or chiropractor and drinking magnesium calm before bed to 100% stop the leg cramps.
I’m 3 months postponing and losing hair but  I love my bundle of joy soooo much
I am happy for you both. Keep thriving!
My dog eats rocks too! One cost us a lot of 💰. 🤦‍♀️
Oh my goodness I'm SOOO exicted for you guysssss! I cannot believe how strong you are, Bec. You are so brave and just so amazing! I can't wait for this baby girl! You two are going to be amazing parents, I can already see it. I love you guys so so much. God bless you two and your already beautiful daughter (and Oso too!)❤
😎👍🏻
I’m so extremely happy for y’all after what y’all have been thru I’m just so happy that everything is going so great! Y’all deserve all this happiness and I know y’all will savor every minute of it! ❤ Love watching you guys!❤❤
Eamon and Bec make me die of laughter, I love your channel. All week I think about a new video!❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
MICROWAVES< MEAT< SMOKING< & TOFU CAUSE CANCER...GIVE YER MICROWAVE TO SOMEONE YOU DON'T LIKE EH<<<GOD LOVES YOU & SO DO I
No shoveling for pregnant women, you can start early labor!
I'm with you Eamon, Women are immense! You look Fab Becs.
ooo, got thave the Cadbury's chocolate. Yum
Put some clothes on.  Do you think we won't believe you are pregnant unless we see your unclothed belly?
I love watching you guys so much. It truly brings me so much joy and I could not be more happy for you both ❤
I'm so so happy for you both, especially after the rough road you've been down these last 2 years. About 4 months ago I went into preterm labor and lost my son at 21 weeks. We named him Casey, which means "brave". I'm sending you both some of his strength and courage to get you through the rest of your pregnancy. You are going to be amazing parents.
What a blessing ❤
After years of watching van life YouTubers living their best life, I have decided to take the leap and start my own #rvlife channel.  Thank you so much for inspiring me to start this lifestyle as well as launching my channel! ❤❤❤
39 weeks 5 days with my second! Little boy die any day! Feeling huge and ready to be doneeeeee
My husband and I have been followers since geez…. The trinity build? And we both watched this video with some tears in our eyes this morning. It’s just so good to see you both enjoying some good moments. Soaking in the normal day to day stuff. You two deserve it! It made us happy today as a by product. Also my dog Winnie watches Oso’s every move. ❤️  So he’s got a fan too!
As hard as the last 2 years were for you, the next 2 years will be even harder. 😂 And regarding the car- a minivan can fit in it more than a pickup. We moved a piano, sheetrock and couch in our Chrysler pacifica.
8:53 my dog eats coal and the inside of her mouth is totally black when she does
This was such a cool video. There were so many fun things that you guys did in such a short time. You look so beautiful Bec, you’re wearing pregnancy well.  What skin care product regimen are you using?  It’s too late for me, but I’m sure the younger women would like to know.  Seriously, you could model skin care for them.
Your aloud to be a little (complainy) you are making a human and everyone experiences things differently doesn’t mean you don’t love your baby enjoy your time pregnancy is great and wonderful but hard I have 3 boys and if it wasn’t for health reasons and money i would love to try for more lol don’t tell my husband 😂
I love cooking shows, Yes chef! and yall
Square....   she will fall if they are not "even"  for her when  she is learning to walk
Im currently 39 weeks and 2 days pregnant with baby girl 💖 a lot of pressure down there but nothing happening yet 🙈 .. My first born boy is 3yrs  old 💙 ..
Bec, you can use the hot tub for short periods of time-- so up to 10 minutes, and you can set the tub temp no higher than 101 F.
Wait. What's this about moving to Toronto? I don't remember that. Explain.
I got to around minute 21 when Oso started barking, and my Chihuahua/terrier and Pomeranian started barking in solidarity.  It sounds nowhere near as impressive as your big dog….😂
When I was pregnant with my 2nd I couldn’t handle cilantro. Still could take it or leave it 5 years later.
So about that firepit  thoo 🔥 ✌️❤️🧡
You two are awesome! ♥️♥️. Love the new walkway and how puppy is such a good boy.
Congratulations on your new journey!!!
18 WEEKS PREGGO TODAY WITH OUR 2ND, WILL FIND OUT GENDER IN 3 WEEKS!
As a chiropractor, I see so many reasons for you two to get in and get adjusted! Is Chiropractic available to you thru government health care? Bec, the way your hips are feeling is good, but getting your pelvis adjusted can help alleviate some of that lower pelvic pain. ❤
A week with you two never gets boring. It’s so cool how you can have fun doing the simplest stuff together. Glad you’re enjoying your nesting time Bec. Really proud of you. And Eamon really is a multitalented (big sweet) guy lol always up for surprises.
I’m 30 weeks pregnant with my second. It’s such a beautiful experience and though it can be so hard, it’s truly the most rewarding thing ever! So happy for you ❤
Love the major appliances. Beautiful handles. $$$$
I'm 35+4 weeks pregnant. It's my 5th pregnancy, and the first time I'm experiencing the pelvic and hip pain -  symphysiolysis.. and it's the worst. Makes me feel even more handicapped than ever..... Thanks for sharing with us, and I wish you a healthy pregnancy and delivery! And me too😂 I've been following you guys for years and am amazed by all you've been through. You are resilient and strong and loving and compassionate, and I believe in you guys so much. I'm really looking forward to this next chapter!
God Bec, you are the most beautiful pregnant woman I have ever seen 😍
Getting a pregnancy belt really helped with my pelvic pain. It takes the weight off the pelvis and ties it to your back.
What a beautiful family right here.❤
Such a wonderful video!!!!!
How often do they upload?
So envious and happy for you that you are able to conceive naturally!  I am going through chemo and previously had 3 surgery on my ovaries (so not many egg left) and 5 ivfs but doctor said now that I had cancer may need to wait 5+ years before can consider using them. Doctors told me my chances of even having a baby is almost impossible.
Awesome video as always Eamon and Bec. Congratulations on your little bundle of joy. Can't wait for all the adventures y'all are going to have.
Why are you all moving!?
Not to be a douche, but dogs can’t metabolize honey. It can make them very ill.
Eamon and Bec. Do you still have that "Brass Lantern"?.
Currently 6 months pregnant with our first, a boy! 💙 Feeling great and completely agree that I wouldn’t trade the kicks and heartburn and sore hips for anything! Bec is a few weeks ahead of me so when I watch it’s like seeing what I’ll be experiencing in a few weeks!
I’ve been following you two since “10 tips for van life and travel as a couple” and you’ve both been such a big inspiration for me as I’ve grown up, started going to college and paving my own way in life! I cannot thank you two enough for being role models and being an example to me of how fun and different a path I can take in this life! Everyone is talking about what their Roman Empire is and how often they think about it in a day, weIl I think you guys are my Roman Empire😂   I am 20 years old and NOT pregnant right now but cheering everybody else here on!😁✌🏽🫶🏼
The calming scene with the deer to Eamon siping loudly had me burst out laughing. The editing choice is perfect!  So happy for you guys, it's always a joy to watch your videos!!!
I just found out that I’m expecting and I’m terrified!
What the comments below all said - wow. Yeah, these “little” projects - they were always day-long + projects.
I’m also about 6 months pregnant and I’m due January 1st!! I wonder how close our due dates are??
Why are you moving to Toronto?
Whuuuut? Moving to Toronto??? Why, when??? How did I miss that?
You are moving?  To Toronto?  Did I miss something??
❤❤❤Thank you!
Bec What kind of oil are you using?
I just wanted to say how great you look Bec.  You two have transitioned from vanlife to home life so beautifully. I always look forward to your wonderful videos.   Love and light to you both
We are so very happy for you guys!  Loved this vidwo!
Fantastic video as usual you two
Hey! Love you guys, I've been following you ever since the summer of 2017 ❤ My best-friends are also pregnant at the same time as you guys 😊👶 And really last year has been long and tough. But we fought through it and we're here now stornger!❤❤ As for Oso 🐻🐶 - I suggest you put a net. I also have quite  a big dog 🐕 and he used to do the same thing. Love you guys, wish you all the health❤❤❤
💖 I get calf muscle cramps in the middle of the night, too. I have realized that I'm low on magnesium, and I need to eat more green leafy vegetables, so I pull out my romaine lettuce and have at it!
You will soon realize you are going to want to have those stones closer together.  Especially, when the baby starts to walk.  I speak from experience! 💖
Very happy for you ❤❤❤
Petition for Oso to get a friend 🥲
I'm 24 weeks pregnant, living in St. Catharines ON, and loving this fall weather creeping in! Feeling good so far, but definitely feeling it in the hips just like you <3 hang in there!
Wait have they posted a video about as to why they are moving to Toronto?
You guys should do a video all about Oso. Oso best moments (funniest, scariest, sweetest). Before he becomes a big brother.
What a lucky little girl to have Eamon and Bec for parents! ❤
You helped alot if you didn't lay it out who would have? 😂❤ For legs cramps nothing beats pure organic castor oil. It can be used on every part of the body. It is healing that penetrates deep. Also good for belly face and hair. I hope you miss country life so much you ditch the dirty city and move back!😂❤🎉
That deer transition was hilarious. Amazing video as always love you two 🫶🏼
Calcium supplements will help.
To stop the smoke alarm beeping, use a spray bottle of water to mist the air around the alarm.
should take magnesium:) x
Hi Eamon and Bec! I have kind of an odd wondering. I am very sensitive to certain sounds and brushing teeth is one of them. Is there any way you could leave that out of your videos or maybe if you show it, you could without sound? I absolutely love watching your videos and do not want to stop. Thanks for reading and considering! <3
🥃👏
Moving to Toronto?!? I guess I need to catch up. 😂
Look at how cute you are very cool
I am 29 weeks pregnant, due December 12th so I can relate a lot to Bec. Pregnancy is hard. But we're expecting our rainbow after losing mulitples babies in the 1st trimester. We couldn't be more overjoyed. Sending you guys much love ❤
The deer?! 😂
wow very interesting experience friend
I just reached my 28 weeks this past Sunday, and I agree the movement and listening to the heartbeat is amazing! This will be our first, a beautiful baby boy due Dec 17.! I’m so glad you get to experience this beautiful amazing journey and that little baby girl is so lucky! Congratulations again and I’m so happy for you and Eamon!!🫂🥹❤❤
Awwwwww! Soon that little bundle of love and joy will be here! Can't wait! Much love!
Oh Bec you are an amazing and strong women .. Your going too be an awesome mom and too think I started watching you channel from Trent and Allie .. It’s been a great journey for you both. So my question too you is where are you going when the white crap hits your cabin..
I’d really love to send baby girl and her parents a gift. Is there an address/PO Box we can send gifts to?
Bec, You’re such a pretty preggy woman! More power to you and Eamon! 🎉❤
double the disability
“Ya little twerp” 😂😂😂
Oso may have a nutrient deficiency in phosphorus, calcium, or iron if he’s eating rocks. Be sure to monitor him closely as rocks take a while to pass through and depending on the size won’t pass through at all. Y’all will be excellent parents, keep looking out for your big goofy boy tho!
honey is not too good for dogs
You are looking radiant because. Eamon did some good work with the slabs there.,oso also wanted in on the project.  U be careful,picking up heavy things bec. Tummy getting big now❤
I can’t say “honey” but I do say “sweetheart” a lot 😂
is  it good and hygienic that dog come in bed with all bacteria and parasites
❤
Omg I remember when you was 14 weeks pregnant and already 6 months wow time flys so fast. ❤
All you women are amazing! Wow❤❤❤
Have you done a video with Bec's morning face routine? What products does she use? She looks positively radiant!
I remember watching your announcement video and getting so excited! I am a month PP with my 2nd child now, but it was still excited seeing a handful of creators i love watching going through pregnancy the same time as me. I can't wait to see you guys embark on parenthood! It is truly a blessing <3
Moving to Toronto?? Did I miss this or did y’all gloss over this new development??
I used to watch you guys when I was pregnant with my first boy 6 years or so ago when you guys were in your van! I never missed a vlog, I watched one video at least every night. Then i stopped watching Youtube. I've had another baby girl since then and boom you guys have popped up on my recommended page again! My second pregnancy was TOUGH! When you mentioned hip pain, i got flash backs haha. I think I skipped quite a few chapters, but so glad to see you both thriving and expecting your first kid <3 sending all the love!!
You may never see this comment but I wanted to say how inspiring you two are. How strong you both are and just how lovely to watch the next chapter of your life unfold, Eamon and Bec! 🩷 You inspire so many. Sending so much love from the other side of the world (I think HAHAHA), the Philippines! 🇵🇭
He thinks the baby is going in the front seat? That’s cute. 😂😂😂
Lmao “food, shelter, se”
I TRUST YOU LORD I know this is the devil testing my faith! I will not waver. Thank you Jesus! Jesus please save us come soon I’m holding on and keeping faith.  Waiting for the rapture. I keep faith even as I constantly struggle to provide for my kids and I constantly struggle to buy groceries. My husband is with you God. At times I feel so alone especially as a single mom. Since suffering a heart attack two years ago and my on going battle with lupus I’m overwhelmed. Both of my sons are autistic. I’m now homeschooling them so my hours to work are limited. Thankfully I have you Lord!The love of others have grown so cold.  I know you will continue to provide you have this far. Faith over fear! Praise God and his son Yeshua! Hear my prayers.
I agree with you- all the aches and pains are worth the feeling of a baby moving and kicking inside you! Such a neat experience
So happy for you guys! Been watching since van life 2019 and I've loved all y'all's content. I was so happy to find you got pregnant! Wonderful news a few weeks after watching your video I found out I'm pregnant with baby #2. I didn't think baby 1 was possible so my husband and I are thrilled to be here at all. Sending love from Louisiana!
How is the greenhouse?
Love seeing your pregnancy journey. Just had my little one four days ago. Motherhood is a blessing ❤
I’m so glad you have a Doula! It makes a BIG difference:)
No shoes crew!
I’m just curious about your diet. Are you vegan or vegetarian?? I’m wanting to go vegetarian
Bec & Eamon, watching your videos is like reading a book! I get transported to a different world and for a short time I forget about all of life’s craziness! I admire how you live life to the fullest, enjoy the outdoors, and always have a positive outlook on life, even when it’s easy not to. THANK YOU for creating your content and sharing your lives with us. ❤️
I have a 5 month old, and when I found out bec was pregnant I was so excited. You’re a warrior and don’t forget the blessings god has poured down on you both ❤
I'm almost out of my first trimester with my first baby! Super cool to see you guys become parents knowing I'm becoming a Mom at the same time. Haven't told friends or extended family but waiting for thanksgiving in a couple weeks to tell them all! We can't wait! ❤😊
It’s the dinner bell at the door for me ❤..  what a cute little family in the woods their growing. 🌱
I am at almost 12 weeks 😢I am feeling krappie poo,😮 I hope it gets better because honestly this is hard 🙈 from SA
What an inspiration you are to anyone who is a cancer survivor
❤❤
I'm also pregnant! 9 weeks and due at the end of April. Wishing you all the best in your last months of this pregnancy
Hi Eamon and Bec! I’m a huge fan of both of you (besides Kara and Nate of course) all the way from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia!  I have a serious question. How would you raise your child with both of you being a vegan? Would you introduce her to a strict vegan diet or otherwise?
Funny thing I have been using the oil as well for my scars and in Germany it’s called bi-oil not like bio-oil in Canada 😅  Anyways so happy to see you three and a half so healthy and happy. Truly melts my heart 💚
Brought to tears listening to how grateful you are. I’m sooo excited for you guys.
Wait guys did I miss the announcement about moving to Toronto?!? Is this permanent?
Love you guys so much! 💛
Im so happy for you guys having a baby.  :)
Just think of it this way, you’ve been training for the last twenty years to prepare yourself for the next twenty years. You guys are literally prepared for anything! 😊 enjoy as it will go by in the blink of an eye! I’m sitting here at 53 years old with grown children missing the years where you are now and spending time with my 28 and 24 year old boys when they have a free time. 💕 love, life and live 🙏🏻
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
I see some similarities with The Bear at 21:31.. Every week watching you from Greece 🇬🇷
I am sorry, but when you showed Eamon's tatoo I read "Taxi" and was really confused  😂
My husband was just like that while I was pregnant with our first baby, I would just mention i was craving something sweet & he'd come home with an entire bag full of ever chocolate bar the store had 😄 i loved it, i didn’t love the 80 lbs i put on though 😕
Bec is so brave well done we are so proud of you 👏🫶🏻🫠🌸🌺❤️🧡💛💚💙💜💗🥰
I'm about a month behind you, Bec! I already have an almost-3-yr-old, but this pregnancy is pretty different. Always grateful for what my body can do but also struggling with body image. Thanks for sharing your pregnancy journey 😊
i am literally typing this at the start your video. I Just wanna say with the utmost respect. All that you have been through your fight and the strength you found to carry on, and now being prego!!! I am Absolutely amazed and astonished by your story. The crazy shit a woman deals with outside of gender vs gender, financial..whatever .. This is why everyone highly under rates what it is emotionally/physically to be a WHOA-MAN!!! It maybe a blessing and a curse, but a true appreciation !
I enjoy your videos so much! I don't know how long I have been watching your videos but it has been a long time. I look forward to every Sunday! Your videos make my Mondays shine and nights easier! THANK YOU! Lots of love
As vanlifers, we had to move the van last night, this was because acorns were falling on the top of the van and driving our dog Flora mad! 😂😂
Yep Eamon, you are definitely a Big Sweet Guy…. Just adorable. Love you both.
Like those tiles but I think they should be close ish together so you nee about 60
Bro the thumb pin picture is so edited 😂❤
Oh guys, I'm so jealous! You have Whittaker's chocolate (NZer here), so wish I could get that here in Europe 😂 You're under obligation to enjoy it on my behalf haha
I currently have a 13 week old and the sleep deprivation is real so get as much sleep as possible now 😅 So pleased you have been able to go on this journey after the year you’ve had xx
Usually when your hips spread, you'r carrying a boy. There have been many surprises.
Have you guys been watching The Bear by any chance? 🤣
Best just simple as that ❤
I had 5 beautiful babies. I'm a grandma now. But when you talked about your cravings, I remembered mine. First pregnancy was grapefruit. 2nd was cranberry juice. Third and 4th I don't recall having cravings. But my last pregnancy  was PB, honey, and banana sandwiches. I find it interesting the variety of cravings ladies have. I've been following you two for about two and a half years, and through it all I couldn't be happier and prouder of you  Bec, for the positivity and joy you continue to show. God bless.
3:21 ... and this is how it happened!
39 weeks and 4 days today. I have an induction booked for Friday if things don’t get started before then. First baby and gender will be a surprise. Terrible nausea in the first trimester but apart from some light leg cramps, restless leg, feet swelling and some pretty bad acid reflux, pregnancy has been a breeze. I’m excited and nervous now for labour to start. Watching your journey from Wales, UK ❤
My labrador eats most things but never rocks.
Love you guys so much so happy for your amazing family ❤
My brother taught ours to play fetch with them
Be careful about him eating rocks bc I watch another page an a dog just got super sick eating rock pebbles from their driveway & she wasn’t passing them so it became a real problem when they ran Ex rays on her.
I had  5 babies and hip/ pelvic pain was the worse part for me. At night i would sleep with a pillow between my legs that really helped.
Oso is the funniest dog I've ever known lol😂
Eamon deserves a cooking show to be honest 😂 22:03
Eamon deserves a cooking show to be honest 😂 22:03
Love your lifestyle ❤❤
Our dog is obsessed with rocks and tries to get them to 'play' with him.😂 he barks and runs around and pokes them with his nose like it's another dog
Already six months!?!? Woah! You guys are living my dream life :)
I have known of you 2 from Sailing La Vagabond.  When ai heard about your cancer, I couldn't watch because I couldn't handle any disappointment(even if it was just in my head).  I am so happy to see that since the last video I watched of yours, which was your diagnosis, this is happening!  It was the nicest surprise I didn't know I needed!!  I am praying for you both and am now subscribed to see your journey(not like you needed it).
That was very good. Loved seeing you work on your place. It will look great when all the grass comes in
I wouldn’t worry too much about what you are putting your body thru being pregnant….it’s what a women’s body has been designed to do….the #1 reason…to bring new life.   It will bounce back…a bit different than what it was before…but it will bounce back better than ever!
Awww Bec you’re glowing. I’m so happy for you and E and bear!!! Ya’ll are going to be perfect parents. The property is looking good. I don’t remember if you said you were going to sell the current property to make the move to Toronto??
Aren’t caffeine and honey bad for the baby? You’re not supposed to give honey to newborns and toddlers, I imagine it’s the same in the womb.
I just think it’s absolutely amazing that you guys are able to do all of this off of your company ! It’s such a dream come true!  Bec you’re glowing ! You’re already such good parents! Y’all deserve this !   I’m not pregnant but have 2 little boys and something I wish I would be able to tell first time mommy me , is DONT LET OTHER PEOPLE TELL YOU HOW TO RAISE YOUR BABY ! your gunna hear lots of chirping in your ear about dos and donts ( especially with a social media presence )  and with my second I’m like all about following my OWN mommy intuition and honestly my second is wayyyy more laid back and I’m 10x more relaxed 😌 both GREAT kids but I can definitely see and feel the difference..  ( 9 and 3 yo )   Also girl yeah the hip pain is no joke . But your athletic so you’re gunna bounce back !!   Also very excited to see oso’s reaction when the baby comes home !
I thought of some more girl names: Elliot, Shawn, Bailey, Sawyer, Rae or Raelee, Jamie Lee ……
I'm probably not going to have kids myself as I'm happy being an auntie, but for some reason I find it really interesting watching people on this journey! You're awesome and strong, Bec
I pray for the health and joy of this family
So beautiful seeing native deer, I don't know how anyone could shoot them
Love seeing the New Zealand chocolate bar!
I have the thing where coriander (cilantro) tastes like soap, maybe you have that too Bec!
Why are you moving to Toronto
Hiya, I love you guys, I'm so proud of you both. You'll be great parents ❤️
Props to amen too for just being a great support system! Oh and osso I feel like Hess going to be more protect than amen! Dogs are incredible!
Omg your soo cute! your whole pregnancy I’m like she’s so tiny. I was waiting for the “pop” and you did and it’s soo cute! Love you guys!!
I think I've been enjoying this new homestead style of videos than I did van life and that's saying something 😂
Love y’all 💖
It's funny how careful we are with pregnancy these days. Back when my mum was pregnant in the 80s, they didn't avoid mayonnaise or hot tubs or anything like that. We turned out ok lol
Can confirm the irresistible urge to call your kids hunnie and sweetie. 33 years old and i never used those terms- my first child was born 3 months ago and hunnie and sweetie are now in my daily vocabulary. He’s my little hunnie!
I’m 31 weeks tomorrow and to tell you i CRIED BIG TEARS when you announced you were pregnant! You guys have been one of my favorites since the beginning! I have PCOS and was told i wouldn’t have kids…and this BOY surprised the heck out of me i didn’t know about him until i was 13 weeks! The fact that we are having our first babies at the same time is so exciting to me even though you have no idea who i am i feel connected to you because we are going through this at the same time! You get a Christmas baby and i get a Thanksgiving one! I’m so happy for us!
Not to be weird but have you have relations and she objected to the stimulus? Lololol. Sorry. Im old. 66. So happy for you guys!! Take pics of her moving in your tummy. I craved coffee ice cream,  lobster but hated donuts, grape juice and sausage. My baby is now 45.
Those oats look really good
wait. yall are moving to toronto?
Wife 19 1/2 weeks. Just found out we are having a baby girl as well!
Love the sound effects of the deer. Glad all is going well with the pregnancy Bec
Repent, believe and trust in Jesus. Amen.
You guys are moving to toronto?!
Hey be really watchful of O eating those rocks. My moms dog just passed away this morning because of eating stones. She was careful but her dog must have snook off and ate a lot. They found two large blockages when it was too late. 😢
My dogs nickname is Rocky, she loves to eat rocks 🪨 😆🫶  I love that you talk about Lee in your videos. I still think of her from time to time.
Nice walkway, don’t forget you need to get a stroller with big wheels for those stones.
Not pregnant but went through several years of infertility. I’m at a place now that I’m not sure I want kids but I know that if the time is right I’ll embrace it! I’ve enjoyed watching your journey and am beyond proud of the obstacles you two have endured!! Much love your loyal fan from Oklahoma!!
I’m 6 weeks and 3 days today and dealing with all the nausea, can’t wait to be at the point you are and feel my bb move around😊
Your videos makes me wanna live life ❤
I really did watch all of this and Toronto is still a mystery to me, maybe going into town for delivery, ??
Did I miss that they’re moving?!?
nuts and seeds helped me with the leg cramps. I had sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds and walnuts daily, about 1 tbsp of each. My legs didn't hurt on the days I had it in my oats. I don't have any help for the hip growing pains though. I suffered through those too.
Why are u moving to Toronto?  Is your cabin just a summer home?
God I hope my boyfriend and I can end up like you two. He’s such a great man. You two are the best end goal ❤️
Leg cramping might be a magnesium deficiency.  Maybe get some labs.
I love your DIY projects!!
Why do you guys want to move to Toronto?
I feel bad for oso because they were like "oh he loves the path and it helps his feet" then he couldnt go on it after. poor guy
I didn’t know u guys we’re leaving for Toronto, what did i miss 😂
Well ... At least you're no pregnant and.. .... ... .. "LIVING IN A VAN...DOWN BY THE RIVER!"
Bec, your belly is beautiful! So much love in your video. ❤ Your pathway is looking good. I'm wondering if in two years you'll be thinking that you should have put the pavers closer together. There will be a lot of tiny steps between pavers when your She-Ra starts walking. You could borrow your friend's little ones and have them walk the path to see how they manage it. So much for time alone without visitors. It would be so much easier to adjust the placement before grass starts growing between them. Love your channel!
Eamon deserves all of the breaks he can get after the cancer year when he was stellar! I know he will be an amazing father, too. Bec is doing an amazing job keeping up with so much. Oso is also doing a wonderful job taking care of his humans. Blessings. So, so many!
Eamon and Bec! You are both just lovely jubbly! Loving the home life video content these days. You both get funnier and funnier with time 😎✌️😝
I'd love to know what skincare products Bec uses! 💜
'Sweetie' perhaps as an alternative to 'Honey'? "Pet names" can be cute sometimes . .   don't you love double entendres?
Bec take magnesium citrate at night for the calve cramps trust me!!!
Your dog might need surgery later in life from eating rocks
At least you have good chocolate to help! Whittakers chocolate from NZ!!
My dog eats rocks too 😂 I never had a dog do that until this boy. Hes a 10 month old foxhound.
The Hunny thing is so funny because I noticed myself calling my husband Sweetheart and Darling a lot out of nowhere and I'm 32. I always thought those sounded so old fashioned and like something older people said but I guess I'm getting to the "older" category 😂
I enjoy every episode, you are so in love and happy
I'm 34 weeks and feeling so much better than my forst pregnancy but boy am i sore. 😂 still so blessed and know I want to do it all over again.
almost 33 weeks pregnant here with a baby girl too!💕 Due mid November!
Thanks for another great video …..catching up with you is an important part of my week.  So excited for you….
Today I just turn 29 weeks with my second and I been feeling de same way, especially the pelvic pain which in my first pregnancy I almost had any
Love the pathway. Did I miss something you are moving to Toronto? What's happening to the cabin in the woods?
I can't help but think you're going to regret letting the lake house go for city living.
I continue being amazed by your daily energy and sustaining love you have for each other   Your baby girl will be so loved and preciously cared for!!!!  And I bet she has the best sense of humor ever!!
My dog eats rocks & doesn’t like the camera!!!!
Hey  howdy, what was that you made the oatmeal with at breakfast it didn’t look like oats?
I remember the doctor telling me that I couldn't give my baby honey in the first year of its life.
Seriously so much freaking love for y’all. Bec, you are such a badass strong woman and you amaze me every damn Sunday. Love y’all’s love as well 💕💕
I think the name “Kai” meaning Sea is beautiful. It can be a boy or girl name. Kai Lee is pretty too. 💖Thanks for sharing your life journey with us, grateful. ~Cate
Love u guy's.  Sorry if I came of weird. Lot of doc's in my family!!! Love u guy, nothing but the best for u 2!!!!
Just remember Eamon, listen to the pregnant woman, she is always right!! 😂😂
Love u guy's, more then always n forever!!!
This might make Eamon happy, but s×x helps induce labor, when ur close!!!
Just be glad you can do yoga/exercise without wearing a tena pad!! 😂
If your calves are cramping, it's because you're low on potassium.  Take a supplement or better yet, eat lots of tomatoes and bananas.
I love seeing you pregnant! As of today I'm 26 weeks pregnant (on the dot) due January 1st!! 🩷
The most random but useful advice someone gave me in pregnancy was SEE A PREGNANCY CHIROPRACTOR! Sooo important for making sure everything is aligned and in place for birth! 👌
Love you guys! ❤
Watching you guys brings a smile to my heart! ❤ Oso is such a good guard dog...alarming you guys about the tractor & acorns is SERIOUS business! 😂 He so sweet🥰 This was nice to see you guys just living life. Also, oh my goodness,  Bec you have such a beautiful glow & your baby bump is so cute! Mine looked like I swallow a big watermelon! 😅Eamon, you are such a loving, encouraging,  & supportive hubby, cooking skills on point! You both are a great team for parenting.  There is such love between you both. Sending much love & prayers for continued blessings your way! ❤
The deer squatting to take a crap and then the cut to Eamon slurping literally made me die laughing. I couldn’t get it together for like 5 mins!
"1 day projects" don't exist when you own your own home. 😅The bump (and Bec, of course) are looking beautiful!
I know you will probably get so much advise but earthley magnesium lotion is your best friend! I practically bathed in it for both pregnancies due to all of the cramping 😂
You guys found out you were pregnant on my birthday!!!!🎉❤
What a fantastic video. And becca you're such a beautiful mum to be xx
Oh my gosh, the dragonfly that was on Bec's arm is on the exact same place as Eamon"s tattoo!! In the exact same position too! Lea is definitely saying hi <3
I'm so happy for you guys!!! Once baby is here it's nothing compared to before or during pregnancy baby girl will test you in so many ways. Our baby boy is turning 6 months and feels like every  other week there's a new routine. Tip for Bec is EMBRACE motherhood don't fight it and don't try to bring back your old life everything changes for the better and when you embrace it there's nothing like that feeling.
He is a big sweet guy! You may want to spray rocks with something bitter. Friend paid $4200 to remove 57 rocks from her Yorkie that liked to chew and eat rocks
🥰😊😎💪👌🌞🌺🍀
Okay Oso barking at EVERYTHING is cracking me up and you two are so casual about it like it’s water under the bridge at this point 😂
❤
So I came across Eamon and Bec’s videos, about 6 years ago on YouTube, (Africa Vlog 1). And it has been so awesome to see how far they have come. They have grown both individually and together. I love that after all these years they always remained their true selves. Eamon and Bec, I’m so so so happy for you both. Sending Lots of love 🩷.
I may have missed it, but why are you planning to move to Toronto?   The cabin looks like a great place to raise a family
My German Shepherd doesn't eat rocks but loves to pick up the heaviest boulders she can find and carry them in her mouth throughout our morning walks.  Totally ignores the lacrosse ball I bring and throw for her.  Makes zero sense.
It is so nice to see you two experiencing joy and not the silly cancer.   You guys deserve some happiness.  Excited for you to welcome a baby to your family.
That stone pathway is so cute!!
20:04 LMFAO
Magnesium can also help with cramps ❤
If you are moving to Toronto what will happen to your cabin???
Thanks for the update and the video with all your hard work.  Can't wait to see the results.  Glad you are feeling good at this stage in your pregnancy, Bec.
When I get married and start to have kids and if Mr Pruitts son  Justin comes to maws house that I am buying and finds out that my kids are playing country music 🎶 he's going to say you kids have got to know me because I can play a good harmonica
So weird..I had the same pain with my Daughter but not when carrying my son ..hate to say it but it got a lot worse for me after 30 weeks..felt like I'd been booted hard inbetween my legs x(
I had bad calve cramps also, my docter advised magnesium supplements, it worked amazing!
Y’all are Amazing!!! Love your videos!  If you ever in Colorado, let’s Snowboard! I gotchu!
Everything looking good 💞🙏
I die 😂😂
My baby girl is 5 weeks old! She's super healthy and growing so fast.
Toronto?! 🥺 what did I miss? No more cabin? Or both?
9 weeks and feeling like absolute death. Cannot wait till 2nd tri 😅
Swimming while pregnant was the best relief I got from round ligament pain! The weightless feeling was so comforting when my belly was getting big & heavy.
Oso will make a great big brother but he’s a handful! I do hope you won’t decide to get rid of him when your baby comes.  Such a great point about what the body can handle. Bec you have handled it all with grace and positivity! It’s an inspiration!
We just had our rainbow baby Sep 6th! He is doing so well after being in the nicu. I unfortunately was rushed to the icu a few days after being home bc of fluid backup. I didn’t rest after my C-section, BEC please rest after you little girl is here, you absolutely must!
I'm 9 weeks today! Still in my nausea phase.
Eamon’s cool and all - but Bec makes me feel like life’s gonna be ok.. somehow.
i’ve been loving going through this journey with you ❤️ i’m soo curious when you’re due because we’re practically on the same track! i’m due january 10th, and i’ll be 25 weeks this wednesday. it’s so crazy to me that i started watching you guys over a year ago and it was so crazy to find out we were both pregnant at the exact same time!! i also have major pelvic floor pain and my hips are expanding so i roll around a lot at night and it definitely bothers the heck out of me but i wouldn’t trade my little girl for the world either!! i also used to wake up super early which is very unlike me, but now i’m able to sleep in soo late and i love it 😍 it’s crazy how much bigger you are than me!! i started out around 110lbs and now im up to 140lbs. my bump is just a little bit smaller than yours. baby girl loves to kick and do karate in my belly as well lol it’s such a weird feeling but it makes me feel so much more connected to her 🥰
Here in the Netherlands, hot tubs are deemed okay from the second trimester onwards. So I'd just jump in :)
It is so great hearing and seeing y’all!! Bec you look Fabulous!! You really have that pregnancy glow! When are you moving to Toronto? Oso will be with you right?? Can’t wait for your next video! Love y’all! ❤❤
umm what was that talk of moving to Toronto?!
I had calf cramps day & night in my last pregnancy. I was looking for a pill when a pharmacist recommended 2 bananas on the 1st day, 1 banana daily thereafter. It worked like a charm. I hope you feel better soon.
Oso is the sweetest! And the new walk way looks amazing!!! ❤️❤️
I usually don’t comment because like what are the odds of you guys seeing it ya know? Lol BUT I saw your story on IG  about how you really like to read the comments and I feel like shooting my shot today lol  I have been following you guys since the van build. In another life I was/am a vanlifer 😂 I am just one week in my pregnancy behind you guys 😊 also having a girl. I’m so happy for Bec and relate to much you have said, down to the restrictions with the hot tub lol wishing all of you the absolute best ❤ see you Sunday!
You say you love she kicks you now..  Just wait till shes like 3 and wants to sleep in between mommy and daddy!!! Kids turn into the devil when they sleep and thrash all around and are all over the place! There favorite thing to do is KICK mom and dad in the backs!!! Lol JUST WAIT FOR IT!! Your gonna regret saying that Bec!! Lol luv u guys and stay healthy!! 😘😘
Love watching these updates can’t wait to see baby girl!!!
Just for the record, I dislike cilantro and corrianda = same stuff.
Calf cramps and restless legs - get Slow Magnesium.  And linseeds for constipation - 5ml per day.
bec looking absolutely radiant in this thumbnail!!
I love the walkway. You’ve done so much work and it all looks so amazing.   You two are going to be wonderful parents!!  I’m so excited for you both! ❤
❤👍🏻
When preggers with my now 36 yr old son, swam at the Y in my sis's old suit. Lavender ish with diagonal stripes that met at the center front seam. It was a YWCA so no cares. Lolol
dropping a like for that deer transition
Please stop eating soya products.  I missed your 2nd scare.  Please don't touch soya or coffee.   😢
To be a man is tough too. Both sexes have their tough parts. I still can’t believe you guys will be parents. My heart is just so happy for the both of you!! God bless this tiny little miracle growing 🙏🏽
Have you always been vegetarians?
15 weeks here🥰I remember watching the video of you guys finding out and like 3 weeks later we found out we were pregnant! The first trimester was rough, I lost about 8 pounds that I'm still working to gain back. But I've slowly been feeling my appetite return and I'm no longer fighting intense nausea or puking every day. Now that I'm in the second tri I'm feeling more of the physical changes happening, like lower back pain and all the stretching and shifting, it's crazy! And such a beautiful, amazing experience! I'm working with a pelvic floor therapist that my midwife recommended to help with the lower back pain and hopefully avoid pelvic pain later down the road. I would highly recommend it! Also working with a somatic therapist and energy worker to release any emotional blocks that may manifest as physical blocks during labor. Just trying to be as prepared as I can be physically, mentally, emotionally, and energetically. But also working to not overthink things and surrender to this transformative experience. ❤ Sending all my love to the three of you, and Oso!
REPENT FOR JESUS CHRIST IS COMING SOON!  Look into your daily life, dig deep once you find out that you possess the characteristic found in Galatians 5:19-21 which are the works of the flesh : adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lewdness, idolatry, sorcery, hatred, contentions, jealousies, outbursts of wrath, selfish ambitions, dissensions, heresies, envy, murders, drunkenness, revelries, and the like.  REPENT! REPENT! REPENT! REPENT! CHANGE YOUR WAYS AND CHARACTERS, CHANGE YOUR ATTITUDE, CHANGE YOUR ACTION, CHANGE YOUR REACTION, CHANGE YOUR WORDS AND UTTERANCES, CHANGE YOUR BEHAVIOR.  You need to replace those evil and sinful acts with Galatians 5:22-23 which are the fruit of the Spirit, love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control. Against such there is no law.  CONFESS ALL YOURS SINS EVEN THE HIDDEN ONES UNTO JESUS CHRIST WITH SINCERITY OF HEART. ALSO ASK JESUS TO HELP YOU FORGIVE ALL THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE HURT YOU AND THOSE THAT YOU, YOURSELF HAVE HURT BECAUSE YOU NEED TO BE FORGIVEN FROM ALL YOUR SINS AND SINFUL DESIRES.  REPENTANCE PRAYER: Lord Jesus Christ, I am a sinner. I need You as my Lord and Saviour. Come into my heart and wash me with your precious blood. Save my soul today, in Jesus's name! Thank you, Lord!  REMEMBER READ THE WORD OF GOD AND ACT UPON WHAT IT SAYS! Acts 20:32; Joshua 1:8 (NIV)  Before you read the Word of God, Ask the Holy Spirit in prayer to help you read the Word of God. Ask him to cleanse your heart from any unforgiveness , any darkness, any impurity and also from any distractions. Then proceed to ask the Holy Spirit to enlighten your heart to understand the Word of God. And finally, ask him to give you the grace to act upon what you have read.  READ THE TEN COMMANDMENT AND ACT UPON THEM EXODUS 20:1-17 (NIV) 01. I am the Lord your God.  02. you must have no other gods apart from me,you shall not make statues for yourself to worship. 03. do not use my name in vain. 04. do not forget to keep the sabbath day for me. 05. respect your father and your mother. 06. do not kill anyone. 07. do not commit adultery. 08. do not steal. 09. do not testify falsely against your neighbor.  10.. do not desire anything that belongs to your neighbor.  ALSO READ MATTHEW CHAPTER 5,6,7 (NIV) OUR LORD, JESUS CHRIST ENLIGHTEN US ABOUT THE COMMANDMENT AND HOW WE SHOULD BEHAVE AND LIVE OUR DAILY LIFE.  LIVING CHURCH is a church that is empowered by the HOLY SPIRIT and the TRUE LIVING GOD and THE WORD OF GOD.   LIVING CHURCH ON YOUTUBE - Official Emmanuel tv - The roadmap to Jesus International ministries - City of Jesus International Ministry - International Revival in New York - SCOAN Thessalonica - Johnchi ministries - Synagogue tv Official - The University Of God - Frank Harvey Logan  - Evangelist Éloge   These living churches are few among the ones that I know. But you should confirm from God in prayer. Ask Jesus Christ to reveal a living church where you can go to worship either physically or in distance.   IMPORTANT READ PROVERBS 3:1-35 (NIV) IT IS WISDOM FOR YOUR NEW LIFE IN CHRIST JESUS.  TIPS: ‐ Ask the Holy Spirit to teach you how to pray and fast. - Ask the Holy Spirit to empower you. - Ask the Holy Spirit to teach you to pray with knowledge and understanding. ‐ Learn to bring Jesus Christ in every decision making, ask for his advice. ‐ Often ask God for his mercy and favor. - Learn to give Jesus Christ thanks for all he has done for you, even if you were not aware. ‐ Ask Jesus to teach how to forgive and love others. ‐ Learn to give him praise in every circumstance, either happy or in pain. - Often Ask God to deliver you from evil spirits and their attacks. ‐ Anytimes you feel fear or anxiety, or doubts rebuke them with the Word. - Tell others about Jesus, save a soul as you are being saved.  MOTTO: WHAT ONE PRAYER CANNOT DO, MORE PRAYER WILL DO THEM. IN YOUR DAILY LIFE ALWAYS PRAY TO GOD.  YOU must know that receiving Jesus Christ in your life will not always be milk and honey. There will be both good and bad times, but because you have Jesus Christ  on your side, fear, doubt ,worry and anxiety will not overrule you.   Also, as you are being saved, remember to save others, tell people about Jesus Christ. You can make a small prayer before approaching them This prayer is an example: LORD, I don't want the soul of my neighbor to perish, I have seen him or her live a life of fornication. LORD, as you bring her or him to me, I cannot mock her or him. Who am I to mock her or him, Father give her or him a willing heart, a repentant heart, a heart to change, let her or his soul be changed. let her or his soul be converted, let her or his soul be redeemed.  Even if others reject your Jesus don't give up, at least one person will be saved through you.  You are welcome in your new life with Christ Jesus. Let your life both open and hidden glorify The True Living God.   ALWAYS REMEMBER YOU ARE LOVED BY GOD. GOD BLESS YOU, SHALOM!!.
Our Doberman used to eat rock,concrete but I used to have to dig out the rectum so be careful. It's dangerous for their intestines.
Food, shelter and s*x is pretty much life, you'e right, Eamon haha
You two balance each other out so perfectly
Great video...but did i miss something? When are we ( as part of the  Emex community😂) moving to Toronto??? Love you guys ❤️
Love you guys so much
Y'all are awesome! I loved watching Bec on the tractor 😭💖💪
Love watching your journey, so happy for you. The walkway is amazing! Ramon, WEAR YOUR SEATBELT!!! Fact: if you don’t engage your seatbelt, airbags DO NOT deploy. You’re going to be a dad. You have to take care of you for “ your girls. “. 🥰
I’m pregnant at the same time as you. I’ve been following y’all’s journey for some years now. So incredibly happy for you guys.  I’m having a girl also! Due November 20th. So excited for us to meet our little ones this winter!  I’m in the nesting faze and soaking it up!!!!! 🤍
30 weeks pregnant tomorrow with my miracle baby boy 💙🙏
Pickup truck seems like a must have for you.
Sorry if this is to personal but do you plan to breastfeed n raise baby vegan?
Bad mistake to move to Toronto its a nightmare down there its not safe place☠ down there stay where you live that environment is beautiful🌸and peaceful to raise kids🤰👣
Your moving to Toronto?
I love you all! Thank you for sharing!!❤😊
It's 'Placenta Brain' and it's real!  L&D nurse here.
34 weeks! Baby boy is almost here, feeling tired & overwhelmed east but so blessed to be on this journey! I’m so happy for you all 🩷 praying for a healthy baby girl
My toddler puts rocks in her mouth 😂 (of course we don't let her eat them)
You two are simply the cutest couple ever. I'm so happy you made your channel. Just following you and where you're at and your journey, with or without the adventures, is beautiful. I'll be here until the end.
Just had our 4th this year. He’s 6 months as of last week. Boy I remember always always peeing with him!
You’re looking amazing Bec!!
Nice intro yooooooooo! 🎉🎉🎉
I was a morning person (like an obnoxious morning person) pre pregnancy and now even though I am sleeping okay (lots of hip pains), I cannot drag myself out of bed in the morning 😴. I'm 32 weeks and the further I get into my 3rd trimester the harder and harder the mornings have become. Hoping I get some good nesting energy soon so I can feel more like myself again!
I ran a 5K after radiation. I cried half the way. We can do hard things. Your amazing Bec. Thanks for sharing your life. Can’t wait to see the baby❤
I am confused. Are they moving? Did I miss a video about moving to Toronto?
Amazing journey!!   With your OB and doula’s approval, magnesium in the third trimester can really help with constipation, leg cramping, and even restless sleep. ❤❤ (it was like a miracle the difference when I learned about it.) And no more pain unsolicited advice from me.
Are you moving to Toronto for just the birth or for the winter?  You look beautiful Bec!!
You are both doing great. Love the start for your walkway. It will look so nice when the grass comes in. I have a friend whose standard poodle has a problem with eating rocks. Unfortunately, he’s had to have surgery twice to remove them. It’s been a couple years now and I don’t really know how they got him to stop.
I have been watching since the beginning and it is truly amazing to see your journey through life. I also think it is so funny how goofy you two have become over the years. You have always been silly, but extra funny recently. I watch you guys in coffee shops and people think I am crazy because I am constantly smiling/giggling. Love y'all <3
13 on trending!!! You guys have worked so far in life and your story is just amazing, and you guys are amazing. I hope this baby gets to enjoy just even a little bit of how amazing their parents are ❤
I love your dog❤️❤️❤️❤️
My husband used to have an old beagle and one day he heard him yelping in pain in the yard.  He ran out to check on him, afraid he had been bitten by a snake or a coyote got a hold of him.  Nope.  The dog had eaten gravel from the driveway and was pooping the rocks out.  He turned out ok, he just wasn’t allowed in the front yard unsupervised again.
Hey Mama! I’m 33 weeks and the hip/tailbone/ligament pain is no joke! Good luck to you!!!!
https://youtu.be/eUBNHDRSd1g
My dog eats and swallows rocks also. He seems to love chewing and eating them, but doesn't like it when they have to come out HAHAHA
Hello from near Sudbury Ontario 🇨🇦 ☺️ OHHH MY GOODNESS BEC YOU ARE SOOOO BEAUTIFUL 😍❤ LOVE YOU GUYS💖✌️💗🙏😇🕊️🥰
God has truly been merciful to you. God is so great! If you give him all the glory in your life, blessings will fall on you like crazy. He loves you guys so much. Have a blessed day guys!!
Bec, Mary & I are so impressed with your inner strength and determination, oh, and Eamon’s not too bad too.
Bec I’m so happy you are in a happy place. I feel like your guardian angel will carry the extra load to help you.
I don't remember your exact due date, but I think it's very close to mine (December 21st) 😍 I'm expecting a baby boy and wow it's been a ride so far! Getting quite big now and feel heavy, my pelvic and back pains absolutely horrible tbh but as you say, feeling your baby kicking makes all of those less lovely things about being pregnant completely worth it 🥰 I can't believe how much love I already feel for this tiny person inside me?! It's crazy. ❤
Careful! That's a snapping turtle; you should handle with extreme precaution and grab them as far behind as possible, or else she may snap you a finger! (very unseemly long neck) Stay healthy, love your videos :)
"You knock up a girl and turn 31 and you start saying honey??" 😂 Love watching you two and I am so happy for the next chapter in your lives. You guys are going to be amazing parents.
It's been said that your DNA changes to be like your husband's and childs when you get pregnant! ❤
When people say "Canadians are nice" sounds really bad. But. you guys sound like some really nice people:)
My little boy is 3 months old now, my body is still not the same. Im tired but still so amazed by everything!! Btw dont eat or drink soy if you gonna breastfeed😅 i learned the hard way with pain in he's stomach and constantly craying😢 (mentioned it cause eamon Said there was one open in the fridge 😜)
This is the best part of my Sundays! You guys bring so many smiles to my face. I am so dang excited for you guys. I would love to meet yall someday.
Nice touch on dimming the music while underwater, I appreciate little things like that 😅🙌🏼
❤❤❤❤
I am also 26 weeks! It’s so fun to watch your pregnancy journey. It feels like I have a friend experiencing everything with me!
Hello from Corpus Christi Tx

I love baby and you❤️love reply pleass
And he cooks!!!!!!!
Only one comment - I love you guys!
Love you two gonna be a great mama❤glowing ❤❤❤
Omgosh you are moving from that beautiful place? What and why? What a place to raise a family
i guess I missed when you announced that you are relocating to Toronto!! I can't believe that you will be leaving that amazing property after all the work you have done to make it so beautiful, but I guess you need to do what is best for your family. I wish you all the best and I look forward to meeting the new addition when the time comes. Bec, you are a champion the way you handled all that you went through over the past year and a half. Eamon, you are a hero for being such a strong support for Bec during a very trying time. Oso, you are such a good buddy.
Also both my kids like to lick alll the rocks they find.
I'm 26 weeks and we also expecting a girl <3 Now I feel great. Wishing health and sending love <3
So many toys!! Looks great
Food, Shelter and Seqqqs
This was very wholesome somehow. I cried a bit when the lake shot came and the deer and then cried laughing when the deer was peeing and the noises came 😂
Beautiful life
How much were stones were you are? I need to do the same.
Bec in the lake is giving SLV vibes!
I’m 28 weeks with my firstborn. Pregnancy has definitely been full of new and amazing experiences and it’s been so amazing to watch you grow along with me! Our baby boy is due December 17th. Wishing you three amazing health and happiness ❤
Bec I am so proud of you I’m 10 months postpartum now and as much as it is annoying to not be able to do somethings I would not change this for anything in the world. Eamon I am so proud of you for being there for. I would recommend that you guys follow your instincts and make some time for yourselves as a couple and then also just by yourself. ❤️❤️❤️
I am so grateful for finding you couple years back ❤ love ya
Enjoy the sleep now before the baby's coming!!! Love from Singapore
Fries and shake sorry if it starts something you can't stop
So happy for you guys! I’m 16 weeks pregnant right now. Having a boy!
Youre glowing Bec!❤ congrats to you both again🎉
I’m currently pregnant with my second. I’m 13w4d today, and have had pneumonia for almost two weeks, but, we are in high spirits! You have gone through so much the past few years, and have definitely been an idol of mine. Thank you for being you and I can’t wait to see your guys next journey!❤️❤️ appreciate you guys!
Why a beautiful life ! Your property is soooo beautiful
You guys are moving to Toronto?!
What is your morning skin routine?
hey as someone living, somehow with bears, snapping turtles and such I have seen many people grab them by the tail to move them off the road safely. or grabbing a big stick and poking hard/pushing lightly to not lose a finger tip to them
I’m currently 29 weeks pregnant and also having a baby girl, I’m watching from Barrie, Ontario. Been following your channel since the start of the pandemic. It’s nice to see your pregnancy journey at the same time!
Love that we’re pregnant at the same time❤️ You look great!
Currently 18 weeks pregnant with my second baby girl (my first is currently 11 months old, two under two!) 🥰 love watching your journey
I am 11 weeks and 4 days today. It will be our first baby as well. I can't believe how much we have to pee it's crazy. I wouldn't change it for the world, though. My first ultrasound is today. Love watching you guys!! ❤
Yeah I knew when you loaded trailer it wouldn’t be enough stones.
Great for both of you and congratulations . I am doing a Chimo and watching you video been a fellowing your program since Covid , Eamon please do another campervan loved the first ones 👌🏼
I have some cute baby names just if you dont have any ideas❤ Rosé, River, Oak, Autumm, Sunny❤
the potassium in bananas might help with the cramps too
hiiiii, i just wanted to share that i’m a few days shy of being 28 weeks :) i’m having my second baby & it’s a little boy! so excited to continue watching your journey through this, it’s awesome
boy or girl
I really feel like it's baby boom year every where I turn on social media I see pregnancies.  I have my 15 & 10 and I do get baby fever sometimes but that's what church family and neices are for get to share their babies.  ❤
Love your space and love your life have a great day really enjoy your videos  I am a fan.
Path looks lovely now, but having had one myself, you are asking for a lifetime of weeding, cutting back the grass as it grows over the stones etc! Bec you're glowing and you guys are such a lovely couple :)
Been following for many many years and this has been my favorite episode ❤
13:00 something about this was so comical that I couldn’t stop laughing 😂
Because you look beautiful.  Baby girl will be here before you know it.  Emon will be a great girl dad. I think he is nesting too.  Take care til next week.
I just wanted to put vote on baby girl name... Lee should be part of her name.
Bec the only advice I have if you want a healthy loved girl is to be careful regarding breastfeeding her if you got the shots and boosters. I am not a conspiracy theorist and have been warning women even before they admitted of traces inside women breasts. Just be careful guys and good luck. Much love! :).
i don't know if this was intentional, but oso is the filipino term for bear. I just think it's really cute
Such a great video thank you Bec and Eoman Bec your glowing and your amazing.. Eoman your such a good partner to Bec can't wait to meet your beautiful girl. Use will be amazing parents. ❤
Hello from Australia,  You are looking amazing Bec!   I’m 22 weeks pregnant with a baby girl 🩷 I started watching your videos just before falling pregnant. When I saw you were also pregnant I felt like it was fate finding you guys, it’s given me so much comfort watching someone else go through this incredible journey. I also feel so connected to her now that I feel her moving. Second trimester so far has been 👍🏼😍
Selling the cabin?
You are moving to Toronto? Why? Your cabin is so beautiful!!
Noticed the soy milk. Soy products mess with your hormones.
Love to relive my pregnancy through your experience 😍   Also, super interesting what’s “recommended” and “not recommended” for pregnant women in different countries. I was in a hot tub a couple of weeks before giving birth and also training with weights until two days before going into labour (obviously I amended weights etc).
Dogs chewing rocks is not good he could swallow and get an obstruction in his stomach, I would buy him some large knuckle chew bones and when he is seen chewing rocks tell him NO and replace with chew bone or kongs with peanut butter.
Now see, I do the opposite. I put cold oats on hot berries 😂 My youngest is 18yo and I still miss being pregnant. I was very blessed to have easy pregnancies, so I miss that feeling. I could feel him snuggle down on my bladder like a pillow and I told him about it and still at 18, he randomly brings it up and thinks that's so cool ❤❤
It’s been a pleasure following your journey and seeing the changes and development in this channel as a whole 💚
I like to believe your pregnancy body knows exactly what it wants and needs, that comes to us in the form of cravings!!
Bec I am so happy for you!! Get a maternity pillow. It will change the sleep game. My son is 9 months old and I swear it happened so fast.
I’m 20weeks with my second, pelvic pain has been happening since 9 weeks! It’s the worst part of pregnancy personally, so painful and makes it so hard to do things!! Also it’s ok to not be helpful during pregnancy, you’re growing a full human and also have to birth them 🙈 our partners owe us one big time!! ❤
Yay for Triumph and Babies! I have one child. He's my only one that made it to the Earth side.  I have secondary infertility. The JOY of being pregnant with a blessing is so overwhelming. Enjoy the feeling, and enjoy your body. It's BEYOND strong.
I had my little boy 10 weeks early in August, he was due in October. We’re hopefully going to be able to bring him home from the NICU soon. It’s been a crazy ride but we’re so thankful. Wishing you all and your little one all the best! 💕
Bec you are my hero !!  You are so strong and resilient and such an inspiration to me. I am so excited for all the joy to come in your lives with the birth of your sweet little girl!!  I look forward to each and every video ....have a great week and enjoy this time in your life. Pregnancy is such a beautiful journey.
i really love youre social media personalities
Just so you know, pregnancy brain is followed by mom brain, which lasts forever. 😂😂😂 (And that pelvic pain is…a pain. Mine lasted for a few weeks after I had both of mine.)
Loving ur big pregnancy bump 💗 How come ur moving to Toronto? 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
I totally agree with u Eamon,from my own experience when my wife was pregnant,women are incredible and strong 🎉
Eamon you make these jobs look so easy, you just know how to do any thing......
Rocks !! Yeah dogs eat certain things that their body is low on. Rocks means calcium. 👍
Bec, is growing an entire human inside of her.  That is an epic thing.  I myself have grown 2 entire humans. They are now 17 and 22.
Bec you look amazing! Your glowing, pregnancy looks great on you ❤❤
Love to see Eamon being so great at recognising how much sacrifice women make! And laughing at the Kenergy 😂
Bec try and wear only close good shoes everytime you walk and rotate between a couple of comfy ones in general. It would support your legs and pelvis so they and you get less tired and than painfull It seems strange like few min of flipflops or sandals here and there whats the demage, but trust me youll feel better   Daily even 15 min of physiotherapy exercise and pelvis and legs will  help too Also swiming ya If you can work with physiotherapist thats great  You can prepare yourself better and preper yourself better to labor and post. Some women just have more pain and thats ok but thers also alloat of info and exercise you can just do   And walk bearfoot on sand for a few minutes
Yep my dog eats rocks too. I once was worried because he acted wierd, went for a quick walk before the vet, he pooped a rock and all was fine after that 🙄🙄
I just wanted to say, please do not eat peanut butter, it is not that it is not healthy, but i saw video of dr barbara that said that peanut is not stored well so it stays long in soils in moisture making them produce mold and then  they are used for making products out of them. In australia they have even banned peanut butter in schools. So please make your reaserch as well! I know you went trough cemotheraphy, food is really important for our body, so that is why i am sharing this 😊 wish you three all the best!
I’m so happy for you guys! It’s nice to see a young couple thriving in this economy. Most of us are in hopeless situations, and your videos give me a sliver of joy.
Mumma of 4 watching from NZ, let the cartwheels and big Rolly Polly's begin for you! Love watching you all.
Is this the ozarks?
You guys are so amazing. Looking forward to more of your journey with Oso and Baby xx
No I haven't  had a drink am. Only coffee Geraldine England
Hello Bec  Lovely to you blooming since we last saw you.  Hi to Eamon who is blooming in pleasure to see so happy. Thank you for sharing 👍 ❤Geraldine  north shropshire England
Am I the only one that noticed the whittakers chocolate? Damn that's travelled far!
Those boys and their toys . You and Trent are perfect machine man models! Bec and Allie are far behind managing those bad boy machines
So so happy you’re both are doing well!! Lots of love ❤
Nesting is gooooooooooood :)
sitting in the front is so freaking dangerous as well. even how he is sitting now is super dangerous for him and you in an accident. you should get him a proper car kennel!
My wife and I are from Maitland Australia and love your channel.  We are currently expecting our Baby Girl currently 26 weeks, due in January.
You have cutest laugh Bec, so stoked to see you all so happy. 😊 much ❤ from Auckland New Zealand 🇳🇿 🪻💜
Why would you ever want to leave your mom to have your baby? I mean it sounds like you not coming back  to the cabin for awhile. How long will you be gone? I hope not too long. You will find out on your own that you will get really tired of all the good doers and you will want to come back home asap. Where it's so beautiful and smells so good both indoors and out. I guess we will see right? Love ya both.
It's wonderful to see you happy and nesting. Put some of that oil on your pubis too, no one told me and I got stretch marks there. Blessings from SA!
Hey. Love the video. Just wondering if you are still fully vegan or what food lifestyle you are doing. Thanks
Because, I have to say that you look sooo great with your hair parted on the side like in the part when you and Eamon where eating his 13 min meal. Youshould where it that way much more instead of up in the pony tails.  Looks like your doing it all right also. I'm just wondering how good it is for baby to be in that ice cold water. I don't know. You two have been a part of my life for over 2yrs and I'm hoping for many more yrs to come too. ✌
Moving to Toronto?
Moving to Toronto?  I must have missed that announcement. Did you buy there?
Not a pregnancy journey but a surgery that is messing with my sense of my body while I recover. So good to hear Bec thinking aloud about that kind of thing. The resiliency is pretty astounding. Thank you for that assurance.  I’m old enough to call all of you honey and mean it, you are sweet and beautiful. This is my favorite video, and now I need to go get my dog and hold her and have a good cry. Sending ❤❤❤❤
I love this length of hair on bec she looks so cute! kinda giving season 3 El from stranger things .P.s You’re baby Bump is so cute you’re glowing mama♥️
Eamon, I find you are sometimes to harsh with Oso! Please don't push him aside when your baby is born! He needs to be part of the family!
Great vlog… Bec you look perfect 🥰 great to hear some introspection from you both… and Eamon for seeing the amazing way that Bec… as a woman is experiencing changing growing …being pregnant and preparing to birth!  It’s a huge huge miracle of life … 🙏🤩✨💛
26 weeks yesterday and I’ve been feeling lots of pelvic pain and lower back pain. I do complain a lot to my partner but I say the same thing, it’s so worth it to have our little miracle baby. We love to hear it’s heartbeat and feel lil kicks and movement! Not long to go eeekk! Thanks for sharing your journey, it makes me happy cry every time I see your joy in this pregnancy! ❤️❤️
What really helped with the leg cramps in the night is taking magnesium! 😃
I love that I am going through this at the same time as you Bec. It took us 15years to fall pregnant and have our little girl due 11th of January. At age 42 though I am certainly feeling my age but my body is dealing with this pregnancy so well even with me technically being high risk. So this little Aussie baby girl will be here a few weeks after yours ❤
😍🥰💝💝💝💝💝💝💝🐾
I’m from near the home of Cadbury chocolate, this makes me very happy to see 💜
Hi from NZ love your videos! Also my first grandbaby is due on the 23rd December ❤
Aloha from Hawaii
U r blossoming Bec ❤ so happy for u guys, u so deserve this 😘
When your second video out your pregnancy came out I found out I was 7 weeks pregnant and I felt very connected to you eventhough we don't know each other. Ive been chronically sick for the past 5 years and eventhough it's not the same as your story I did feel some similarities. Sadly 3 weeks later I had a miscarriage. Now watching your videos every week have different feelings for me, on the one hand it makes me sad sometimes seeing where you are now and where I could have been. But it also makes me so happy to see how it's going with you and your journey  ❤ so thank you for sharing
Water woman! The mistress of life and hydration!  Love it. You look beautiful Bec.  Thank you both for allowing us into your life.  Also, if you ever run out of jobs to do at yours, then I got paaaaahlenty for you to do at mine :P   xoxoxoxo
Eamon and Bec are 👌 Awesome. Such genuine people. Very endearing. Pregnant Bec is truly adorable. So happy and excited for this new chapter in you're lives.
Yes my Silver Labrador has ate rocks since he was a wee babe.  I don’t think it has hurt he is 85 lbs at 1 year.  Wish I could share pic here
27:02… sounds like baby girl’s name might start with a J? 😊
I sure hope you put lees beautiful name in with the baby girl ❤
Watching from cape cod MA! Don’t watch Kara and Nate stop in Mass cuz it is not like that at all and they went to all the stupid places.
Great video! I really loved the visit from Lee, aka Dragonfly. I think she was there to let you know she is so excited for your pregnancy. 💕
I am so proud of both of you. No matter what you always look on the positive side, you show your gratitude. Beautiful couple, soon family. It is so exciting. This was I really fun video it show case how much you love life, each other, and all the little things. Dragonflies definitely visits from Lee 💜 Much love 🤗🤗
It’s great see the both of you thriving and the night and day difference compared to last year
So sad you guys are moving to the city - where you currently live is an absolute dream! Most people these days are flocking from Toronto and moving to where I am (Muskoka) to get away from the city. Hope you're not selling so at least you'll have it as a cottage. Trust me, you'll miss it once you all leave.
Bec, you look beautiful! And I don't know what happened to Eamon, he might be pregnant too cuz honestly he looks GLOWING just as Bec.
Bec mentioned moving to Toronto. Does this mean you guys will be selling the cabin? Or just moving to Toronto for the majority of the year to be closer to family?  Love the cabin and all the memories it has for you guys!
How did you get yourself some Whittaker’s choc? 🇳🇿
Bec, pregnancy is a state of health. Your body is doing what it was designed to do.  You're handling it so well!
Bec you are GLOWING!!!! ❤️❤️❤️
Oso is on top of his guarding you Bec and his sister. He has more of a serious look on his face when Eamon isn't right with you. Your daughter is gonna be one protected little girl. ❤. Love the walk path
Wait!!! MOVING TO TORONTO?? UR SELLING THE HOUS
I must have missed you telling about the move to Toronto.
Repent of your sins and put your trust in Jesus Christ tor hell awaits
I hate cilantro lol
Bananas really helped with leg cramps during both my pregnancies.... guess I needed more potassium/magnesium.
You are moving to Toronto?
That turned out  great! Good job!
You guys are moving??? 😢
My Lee shows up as a Dragonfly  too . ❤ watch the movie!!
Does anyone know where they got oso or how they got him?
❤❤ i love this it's so good to see happy video's
Whittakers Hokey Pokey chocolate! What’s New Zealand chocolate doing in Canada? 😮
Can't wait to see the grass growing in on your new path.  I luv your curls bec. You're looking so beautiful! And how cute it Eamon appreciating women.  Awwww Congrats you two!
Hi Bec, I am 27 weeks (and 3 days) pregnant watching your video. I turned 40 in May this year and I am lucky enough to be loving pregnancy this time around. I have been through IUI so am on this journey as a very happy solo parent - with the love and support of my 13 year old daughter! I have loved watching you grow (in more ways than one) and been a fan of your channel for years xxx

Amazing energy you two have. Thank you for always sharing.
Don’t worry about not helping, lol! You have the kind of man that absolutely loves building beautiful things to show his love for you and his babygirl!! Support him in whatever way that shows your love and appreciation!!❤❤❤
For calf cramps/Charlie horse I took magnesium bisglycinate 400mg. It was a reco from my chiro, did wonders for me!
Normally, u would dig down, level, put stone dust down, compact it, then place ur walking stones, but I like the way Eamon does it😊
One year you are fighting for your life and the next year you are growing a new one! ❤
What's this about moving to Toronto?! Why would you want to leave that oasis you've created????
Aw how y'all so cute ?? ❤ Drink pickle juice before you go to bed, kills the cramps 😉
you have created a very beautiful home for your girl. i just love the fact that she would grow around trees and lake and all the nature. all the best guys
My sweet lab would carry a rock in his mouth during walks . He loved rocks !
Enjoying your videos! Did I hear you say you're moving to Toronto? I will miss your cabin! ❤
my wife is 33 weeks pregnant with twin boys and you women are amazing. She is also sad she cannot sit in the hot tub.
goodd night
Where did you find vegan mini eggs? 🤤 I miss those so much.
❤❤❤❤ I'm so happy for you! You two are an amazing, genuine couple. You deserve the best! You're going to be amazing parents 🎉
(John 3:16,17) "For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believes in Him should not perish, but should have eternal life. For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world might be saved through Him." (Romans 10:9,10) "That if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your that God has raised Him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart, man believeth unto righteousness and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation."
I absolutely love every project you guys do --- it's just so amazing to see new parts of the cabin be put together in every different video 💛💛
❤❤
So enjoy your posts! Your laughter is beautiful and sense of fun is so uplifting. The humour and clever editing in your videos keep even the simplest of activities interesting. Even though you struggle at times Bec, you’re glowing and so joyful. Thank you for sharing your journey and strong spirit with us! Way to go Eamon for recognizing her strength and the impact being pregnant has on a woman!! 🙌 Brightest of blessings to you both! 🌻🦋
That would look great with grass growing between the blocks, or a succulent like “Hens & Chicks”!
Sorry Eamon but Bec can blame everything on pregnancy Brain! 😂😂
I wonder if Oso has Rottweiler in him, Rotties tend to love rocks! 😂😅
Why would you leave paradise for Toronto
Why are you moving to Toronto
This was one of my favorite videos so far….Bec you are just glowing! The deer squatting and Eamon making the slurping sound got me 😂😂😂, I just had emergency surgery a week ago so I needed the laugh. The walkway looks great! ❤
love your videos 😊
Your bump is absolutely gorgeous. You are so glowing beautiful girl. Bringing back pregnany memories. It goes by so fast. The new walk way will be so wonderful. But I am curious you said you are moving to Toronto in the shower? Is that just to be closer to a hopital during birthing? hugs
Honey is definitely a super food! My dogs like it as well. One picky, one not at all. Another super great thing for them is goats milk! Great for gut/immune health.   So happy for you both on this parenting journey! Like Bec, I was hit young with a horrible diagnosis, I have a rare nerve disease of my small fiber nerves. I've had pain issues my entire life, but it all went horribly wrong when I was 24. I'm 36 now. I decided with lots of therapy not to have kiddos of my own, but was so fortunate to basically co-parent with my best friend. They're both in college now! And I have the most amazing nephew and niece, and so many friends with awesome kiddos. I love your content, want Oso! and can't wait to see what amazing parents you'll be! I was raised rural, outside always, no TV, computer until I was in my early teens. My parents taught me how to make things, how to garden, to cook, to can, to clean, do my own laundry, care for pets, etc. from very early on. On weekends I started working at a family friends farm around 8yo. I loved it all because it was all made fun, all an adventure, and I'm so damn grateful for what I was taught! I completely see you guys being such parents. Raising your children to be independent, well rounded, kind, grateful human beings 🙂❤.
Bec oil your whole body. I forgot my  Décolleté area so when my milk came in I got tiny vertical stretch marks.  In my day (1976) Hersey had a cocoa butter bar (white) that the Pharmacist kept cool. I would stand by the wood store and melt it all over   ( or body heat)  but… the above, (AAA-B😂) otherwise no stretch marks, 3 babies. Not sure you can find pure cocoa butter 🤷‍♀️ Smells so good ❣️   Happy Birthing❣️ Oh,  don’t  forget to drink raspberry tea❣️ Much love and blessings ❣️  Also I checked my status and saw my subscription was unchecked. Not sure how that happened! FYI for other subscribers.
Love to follow your life in the magic cabin and environment you built for yourself, Thanks for the inspiration!/ Helena from Sweden
YOUR AMAZINGLY STRONG BEC❤  And the 30 year old pillow is so my husband too... 😂 xoxo
If you plan on having Oso in the car with the baby, please please please crate him. You wouldn't drive around without your baby in a car seat, this is the same thing except Oso would also becomes a 100 lbs dog missile with hundreds of pounds of force in your vehicle if you ever get into an accident.
Great video. Shout out to La Leche League for encouragement,support and information. Try attending a local or virtual meeting. You won't have any regrets. Best wishes Eamon and Bec.
God bless all "3" of you!!!❤
You're both So..So..cute!!!😂 God bless you both🙏👍❤💞
Why are u moving to Toronto
It’s been great to see you grow, both physically and emotionally this last couple years. I can’t wait for baby girl to fill your lives with more love than you can imagine!!  My husband and I, 64 & 58 respectively, bought 10 acres two years ago, and had to buy our first tractor. We have loved it! It is our snow plow, our post hole digger, our gravel spreader, etc. We both have a blast driving it! Thankfully, ours has a cabin on it, so we can snowplow in the below freezing temps we have here in Spokane. Keep up the good work, and growing that baby girl, I’m sure she’ll be a real cutie! ❤
Front seat air bag deployment is primary reason Car ❤ Seats are 99.99% of the time installed in the back seat. Pretty sure back seat install is required by law in U.S. Also prevents real danger of driver distraction too.  Children under 10 yo are not allowed to be in front seat in U.S. either.
I pray you will accept the healing, protective intent I am sending to you Now, as I write... Thanks for sharing your life.  BTW, I think, the dog can see his reflection in the Camera lens, my dog does the same thing... Giant Healing Hugs<3<3<3
Vanilla greek yogurt with fruity pebbles cereal. You have to give it a try.
I am so happy for you both!!! My husband and I have been watching since 2018! Can’t wait to see what the future holds! I feel like I know you both! With love from Kentucky
I wonder if Honey helps immunity or allergies with Dogs…. It helps my allergies and really a general “good” feeling if it’s local Honey.
Hate to break it to you, when you leave the hospital, the rear facing baby seat can only be in the back seat, so ya might as well let him sit up front. Check your states laws❤❤❤❤
Food, shelter, … 😂😂😂
Oso in the bead is just so cute!
Just Love you!! Thank you for sharing your lives with us.... Sending much Love & Sunshine....
❤  all the best! So hapoy for you guys!
I must have missed the episode on moving to Toronto.
I'm so sad to hear that you're going to move.  With all the work you have done there it's such a shame.
Wow, you guys have been trough a lot, but you are blessed to have that cabin in such a beautiful location. 💞👏🇦🇺🙏🏻
Start buying Christmas presents now, and wrapping them as this will make life easier when the time comes.
Watching from Northern Nevada with my 21 week belly. We’re team green so baby and I are just chilling.  This pregnancy has been vastly different from the first. I’ve had heartburn, round ligament pain, and lightning crotch from the beginning.  And even though it’s hard I wouldn’t have it any other way.
When you posted your IVF video in Feb 2022 we had just found out we were pregnant. It was our last round of IUI after 2 recent losses and if this one didn’t stick, we would be moving to IVF ourselves. That video was hard for me but important none the less. Thank you for sharing that journey. It made it less scary.   I’m happy to report though that we didn’t need to go the IVF route. That pregnancy did stick and we will be celebrating my beautiful little boys 1st birthday next weekend! 🎉❤  I’m so happy for you both. You’re going to be amazing parents to a very lucky little girl.
❤️✌🏻🙏🏻
Love your videos❤
re: Lee coming to you as a dragon fly. You might enjoy the book Signs: The Secret Language of the Universe by Laura Lynne Jackson. But if you're not up to read a new book, in summation, ask her to come to you in whatever way you want. Be specific and then feel the love when she comes just as you requested.
You look so good Bec ❤ but you need to get that bio oil down lower on the torso, lol, and don't forget the hips!!
Is eamon a builder by trade??
My baby is 16 months old but the memories of pregnancy are fresh so it’s neat to see your journey. Pregnancy can be so hard and is so long. I didn’t enjoy it as I was either sick or uncomfortable for most of it but would do it 10x over for my girl. It’s all gonna be worth it! I think it’s a smart move to be in Toronto for postpartum. I found the first year of having a baby to be really isolating so hopefully you have a good community there and lots of support.
Love you guys 😊
The cabin is looking better than ever!! Wow, bec, you are going to be the best mama, it has been a year, you are strong and amazing and beautiful as ever
It's great to see oso watching bec on your walks he's being protective and he will be protective of your daughter.  So enjoy it . Someone who had dogs with our son they change.  You can't have cats by the baby or the dog will chase it away.
“I heard that you little twerp” I haven’t heard that name In soo long 🤣🤣
It’s been so amazing watching your life and how it has changed overtime. You two have inspired my own life so much and it was so special to get to come and support you at the 5k last year. It was a trip that you two completely influenced l. It was our first van trip in our van we built after your 2020 van build. It would have been so amazing to have been able to share almost the exact same pregnancy timeline with you but life had a different outcome for us. It makes me so incredibly happy to see you getting to become a mom. Love you guys and hopefully we will be able to meet again some day!
A good calcium/magnesium will help leg cramps.
Bec you are glowing. Love love love your house and the surrounding area.
Hi from Oregon coast!! Bec is a warrior!! So beautiful to see and the support Eamon gives. Are you moving to Toronto?! ❤❤
Oh my gosh... Eamon's face when Bec over cranked the tractor... hysterical!
Doggos eating rocks can be due to a lot of different reasons from nutritional deficiencies to parasites. Trip to the vet can help. Congratulations on baby.
My calf would cramp up and I had bad heartburn throughout my pregnancy. I had very bad heartburn in labor and they had to give me medicine for it in labor.
73 years old so no pregnancy stories. Thank goodness!!  Bec, you are doing great!! Before you know it you will be even MORE tired for a while.  So, rest now so you can save up the energy you will need.   But good choice on having trailer instead of truck. We have 2002 4 Runner we bought new.  We have used a trailer since we bought it and also have the luxury of a "car" without trailer. Have thought about a truck many times and never could find a good reason to buy. Good job on the path.
I'm not pregnant but I had a biopsy on my right breast. I'm waiting for the results.
❤❤❤❤❤❤
My dog had seizures and honey was really helpful to bring him back to full consciousness and shorten the postictal state.
Ask them about magnesium too. I know that it helps with cramps in legs at night too
We’re so close in pregnancies 😃. I’m just over 26 weeks 🥰.  Guess it depends when this is filmed though haha….  I’m feeling great!! I’ve been so blessed with a so far easy pregnancy. I’m hoping the third trimester is just as good to me as the first two!! 🥰
Hard to believe you already 6 months
Eamon and Bec are moving?!?
6 times….I’ve birthed 6 babies.  1st were twins (boys) weighed 7 pounds a piece.  Nothing better than pregnancy.  Pure joy.
Looks like me lady hasn’t done much 😆😆😂😂. ☠️. Baby Dad is so funny
Love seeing the projects y'all take on! So fun!
Lovely to see you both so happy
What’s the machine you put the chickpeas into?
Magnesium will help with the cramping. I used a magnesium body spray and rubbed it into my calves before I went to sleep. Also - swimming is so insanely beneficial in pregnancy. When you're 36+ weeks the breast stroke is a great way to encourage baby to assume the best position for birthing. Check out spinning babies as a source for this :) My baby girl is 6 months old now. I have watched you guys for years, so of course I watched you all through my pregnancy as well as post partum. Your vlogs about CBD were what I fondly and vividly remember watching while snuggling my days old baby. Also.. Eamon was one of my names if we had a boy. Needless to say, I'm a great fan and you guys are so inspiring. I live in BC - I love that you guys are canadian too! My absolute best wishes to you on this insanely special journey of yours.
So so so happy for you both!
I gave up caffeine through my entire pregnancy. But I will say breast feeding was a challenge but you have to get on a schedule.
Curious about birthing plans since you’ve mentioned a Doula and your OBGYN.  Will you be sharing some of this in future videos?
The deer peeing and sound effects oh my GOSH 😂😂
Your looking so radiant with pregnancy ! It suits you ❤❤❤
Can we talk about how Oso was suppose to be a foster.. got Bec through cancer and became an adopted boy and NOW IS HERE FOR THE PREGNANCY’ wow , y’all found a soul dog
About a week before birth, you will feel your hips change and kind of open up. Then mucus plug, then baby.
Looks great
My dog ate rocks when she was younger. I had to have her stomach pumped multiple times (very expensive) I hope he doesnt habe those issues.
Is Max's tractor going to be bigger than yours lol
💝💜🐾💕
Do you only feed your dog dry food? Dry food is so bad for pets. They need good wet food for more protein and moisture.
Bec the editing with the deer and eamons drink 🤌😂😂😂
Just what I needed, a dose of Oso.( I love that dog) ... 😂 and of course Eamon and Bec.😂🤣
A move closer to your "village" is probably a good idea if you're feeling lonely right now. Having a baby can be so isolating. At least that's my experience.
What a tap over your stove I've never seen that before.
Hi. I just a t wanted give you a heads up. I was 34 when I had my first and only child. I was havin pain in my ( warning)..... outer lips down there. Well come to find out my son's put to much strain on my veins in my hips. After having him years later I had swelling in my ankles. Had test done and my veins running down into my legs have narrowed when I was pregnant. All I had to do to stop this was where compression socks on my feet and legs. So just something to watch for. I talk to my doctor at the time he never told me any of this. So if ur havin pain down there in that area get the socks.... pregnancy looks good on you. Happy for u two
25:01 LOL!
Careful with doggie eating rocks, they can get caught in the throat and then surgery will be required
Hi please look into your dog eating rocks. That can cause serious medical issues. It can clog his intestines. I have seen dog have to have emergency surgery.
You look so cute✌️💜
Bec, You are so adorable pregnant. Adorable otherwise too but you just look so cute with the growing bump. I am so happy and excited for you both. I have 3 kiddos and hated being pregnant each time BUT I am beyond grateful that I was able to give life to my 3 amazing kiddos. It's an amazing gift.
You two are going to be amazing parents ❤️
BTW,  I'm Lori, from Windsor, Colorado.  I have a cabin near Estes Park with the most amazing view of all the front range mountains,  it's my go to place when I need a time out.  😊
I can’t wait to see the baby in 3 or more or less months
Girl! What an amazing journey you have been through! You look beautiful and healthy and so , so happy. Sending so much love and positive thoughts to you and Eamon on your next big adventure ❤❤
Hey because I am new to your channel been watching your videos lately and I must say I am very happy that you get to experience this beautiful journey I am also pregnant I am 36 weeks I am almost there and its been going as good as it can be 😋😋
Saw this video and had to save it to watch properly later, makes me happy every Sunday, thanks guys x
Bec and Eamon, watching your pregnancy has been so much fun for me.   After all the years following you,  I can truly say, this is the best part of your journey❤   My daughter is pregnant,  I'm going to be a grandma for the first time🥰   I can't wait to hold that sweet little one.    You beam Bec,  love your smile and the positivity that shines through you.  So excited for all of us to meet this precious little girl. ❤
Carolina:  meaning song of happiness. I just wanted to throw that name into the "name hat." 😘 You're both going to be fantastic parents!  Bec, you look so lovely.
Wait did you say your moving to Toronto? When is this happening? Are you selling your property?
I love you so much Beck and I am so proud of you. You guys are so sweet together and I can't wait to see your baby girl!!!
moving to Toronto?  did i miss something?
Currently pregnant at 28 weeks 6 days! I've been feel physically really well with good energy still and very little complaints. However this pregnancy has been very much more mental taxing for me. 9 weeks ago we went for out anatomy scan and were diagnosed with IUGR, or fetal growth restriction. We also found out then it's a girl which was our hope. At that time baby girl was measuring at the 5th percentile classifying the growth restriction as mild. We were then scheduled for follow up growth scans every 3 weeks and because she was so small at the first scan they weren't able to get a very good picture of her heart, they wanted to see us just one week later for another try. At that visit baby had made little to no progress growth wise tanking her into less than the 1st percentile and reclasifying the growth restriction as severe. I was then expected to follow up three times a week for a bio physical profile, to check on baby's overall health and an umbilical artery dopler to check blood flow from the placenta. It was then that we found an intermittent absence of flow in the artery. That's indicative of an insufficient placenta.  The blood flow got better, then worse, then better again, and then severely worse with a pertinent absence of flow at 25 weeks. I was admitted to the hospital and given corticosteroids. That's more baby's lung maturity and preventing brain bleeding if I were to deliver that early. Luckily for us it just so happened to improve bloodflow once again. I stayed in the hospital for a week and then was able to get home to the rest of my family. It has been a lot of long drives and watching and waiting. The doctors told me that expect to see the absence of flow again at some point. Even if they don't, given the history they will recommend delivery between 33 and 34 weeks. It certainly beats 25 but it means that baby will be headed for NICU. Things are looking good since the steroids no absence of flow so far at all and baby grew for less than the 1st to the second percentile. If she grow to above the 5th percentile by 33-34 weeks I can think about potentially a full term baby. That's what I'm hoping for.   The watching and waiting for things to decline is difficult. The term insufficient placenta is difficult. I feel somehow like it's my fault. And even knowing that it's not its difficult to know that my body isn't providing a safe place for this baby to grow. It's nothing compared to cancer, but I do have MS. I wasn't diagnosed until after my first baby was already 1, therfore I never took any treatment. For the past 3 years before this pregnancy I was taking immunosuppressing injections once a month. There is no research to support my assumptions, but none disprove them either.  My MS specialist doesn't think so. He thought it would be okay for take the entire 1st trimester. My maternal fetal specialists think that it's a possibility. It's difficult when your body fails you. It's even more more difficult when it fails your baby too. I'm thankful you guys don't need to go though this. There is comfort in knowing that I'm not alone but I wouldn't wish it on anyone. It's good to hear that your babe, and back are happy and healthy.    Does bec have a pregnancy pillow? They really help with hip pain stuff at bedtime
cries in Texas weather
Just a lovely YT with the bestest YTubers out there!  ❤❤. So excited for the new addition to the fam soooon!!
So blessed…👠🚌👠
When the lake gets too cold to swim, you can keep the hot tub at an acceptable temperature for pregnant people and Bec can float in there for her hip and pelvic pain (without the jets).
We are 30 weeks pregnant!!! WE are from Weslaco Tx, and we also have a BABy Girl Montserrat
You guys deserve every bit of happiness! ❤
Thanks!
Bec has all my respect. What an incredible human. Her story and journey are inspiring. Such a crazy full circle experience to go from battling cancer to creating new life. Of course love to Eamon, who couldn’t be more supportive. You guys rock.
Each and every Sunday I look forward to seeing your videos. Bec it is so good to see you healthy and happy! A fan from Boise Idaho❣️
We were pregnant at the same time at one point but my little buddy came out at 33 weeks and it's now 5 months. By the way i wanted to tell you what happened to me when my milk came in  (i wasn't sure I'd be able to breastfeed because of previous two surgeries) but it did and the scarring caused me to get two big benign lumps and I'm only leave this comment in cuz in case that happens to you because of the surgery i don't want you to get scared and stress with a new baby because it made me stop breastfeeding because i was so scared and i feel like i was robbed of something that was making me so proud (going through biopsies and mammograms and ultrasounds dried me up because i couldn't pump as i was supposed to), specially having a preemie.
Hi Bec happy 6 months, you have been through so much and gone through it all with such bravery grace dignity and even humour, Emon and Oso  have been a great support, your baby girl is been born into a beautiful family, the new path looks great, love watching ever thing you put out, swimming in the lake, Eamon's 13 minute curry, all of it. Thanks for taking us along on your journey.🙏❤️🌈
Hey Bec, I’m 15 weeks today & im soo tired ! I just want to sleep all day long lol. I having a baby boy💙 my due date is March 18th
19 weeks! Congratulations on your baby girl! ❤
So,so happy for you.....babies are wonderful✨
Moving to Toronto?
27 weeks with a baby girl :) due December 23
Last trimester, definitely nesting phase.  My boys are 20 and 16, the first one will be 21 in December!  Watching and listening to you is bringing back such amazing memories of being pregnant. Thank you for that.  My partner and I love watching you, he is 61 and I  am soon to be 59.  We’re at the other end, our baby is moving to London, England next n b Tuesday, and our youngest is attempting to get to school for grade 11, that’s a  whole other story, a brilliant boy testing his boundaries, but … I digress, we LOVE you guys.  When I said we were at the other end, we are, and we are thinking what’s next, maybe Van Life and travel!  All  I know, is that anything is possible, and I seriously feel like I’m in my 30’s.  Life is for living, and you guys are living! Thank you for sharing your life with us, it’s a highlight of our week!  P. S.  This is Caroline, posting under Rob’s account , but he feels the same 😊
I'm tellin' ya... if you wait till last day of the year, her birthday will be 123123🥰
Bec is lucky to have Eamon through her health issues. I was diagnosed with ALS and my husband abandoned me. He's now neglectful and emotionally abusive.
Yes if it’s local honey it helps a dog with allergies
Bec, your hair is looking SOOO cute!!! You have the perfect wave!
Crampy legs always need organic orange juice 🧡 potassium
My dog hated the camera too! He would avoid eye contact with it and stopped acting normal and stiffen up! LOL! I’m pregnant too! 18 weeks, due February 2024. Sending you guys love from California 💜
Oso has the best life ever❣️❣️
I love how u said Lee always shows up as a dragonfly 😘
In the video, he stands behind his partner and demonstrates this simple yet genius idea, saying, “So if you wanna do a favor for that pregnant lady, GENTLY lift her belly up, you’ll hold maybe 10-15 pounds. When she’s ready, you’re going to GENTLY lower it back down.”
I have been watching your videos for at least five years and watching your family grow fills me with so much gratitude! I feel like my family is growing with you! I can't wait to see your next videos. A big hug from Barcelona ❤
Bec you look absolutely beautiful with your 6 month baby bump!!👶❤❤❤  Good luck with more "than an afternoon" project 👍
You need to oil up the hips and bum too. I regret not knowing that.😊
New Zealand’s whittikers chocolate ?!? So cool ❤ my home
You two are so darn cute and so much fun. I look forward to every Sunday watching all your antics. So happy for you Bec your experience of having a wonderful pregnancy. And of course Eamon is experiencing it also. :-)
You all the coolest couple ever!!!
❤️
Much love❤
I can’t believe Bec is 6 months pregnant! Y’all(Bec) have been through a lot in the last 6 months, but I truly believe that the Lord has bless you and your family tremendously. Happy Sunday and God Bless!
Wow I’m younger and haven’t experienced a relationship yet but when I do I want mine to look like yours y’all are a beautiful family and I’m so excited to see it grow
OBSESSED with the edit you did with the music when y’all were swimming!! That was stellar. Proud of you both and am always looking forward to every update you give!
I made coconut mango curry for lunch!! Soo good!
Do your best to stop Oso from eating rocks!! I know he’s a knucklehead but I hope you can stop him. I had a pup that did this and unfortunately required surgery to clear a blockage from it. After surgery and healing, she did it again with a larger rock. Vet explained that this surgery isn’t survivable multiple times so we had to have her put down.
Moving????
Are you moving to Toronto permanently?  Will you keep your cabin?  It will be a big change.  I hope you keep the cabin for a getaway.  When the baby comes, Praise Oso, and when you bring the baby home, include Oso in everything.   Don't yell at Oso around the baby. Just include him.  It will be a better transition for everyone. 😊
I'd love to hear from Bec who I know was so grounded and doing the mental work during her cancer journey on what she's doing to prepare for postpartum. I suffered with terrible postpartum anxiety and depression last year, and will be changing a lot next go around if there ever is one. You talking about wanting to feel a semblance of normal, I relate to even now that my baby just turned one, wondering when I'll feel myself.
Girls will make you crave sweets forssure!
Threw all of your ups and downs you two have been going threw together the last year or so would put alot of strain on most couples and seeing you two smiling amd loving on each other while also leaning on one another for support is such an amazing thing..i have much love for you both. And so happy to see you guys starting your family. God bless and prayers for the future! And BTW me and my wife are 26 weeks along and having twin baby boys.
Did I miss the announcement that you’re moving to T.O.? I thought you made the nursery there at the cabin!?
You are going well, i imagine breaststroke will be very good for you to do while pregnant, good stone pathway and love the humour with the two of you but not liking the Max mullett.
Congrats on your journey, and also on trending!
Bec, you are absolutely a stunning mom to be! It really takes me back to the time I was pregnant with my now NINE year old. Wild. Also excited for you three to move to the city! If you're still looking for a place to live, the east end is where it's at, but then I'm a little biased, haha! 🎉
Great video and glad to see you’re doing well. Can I ask a quick one tho. Is your honey Vegan? Just wondering as I like honey on my tea as well.
Yes charley horses in the calves were the worst part for me… the tensed muscles literally would get stuck for a good couple mins, just have  Eamon massage them out even tho it’s painful to touch in the moment it’s the only way to get out the kink. Maybe a massage gun thingy could help too!
Electrolyte powder with collagen great for muscle cramping.
Eamon,  From the practical point of view, I would prefer an F-250 Tremor.  A little more capacity than an F-150 with more offroad capabilities and without the big feelings a an HD diesel truck which normally have a full size bed.  But if I wanted a cool toy, at least I would get the Bronco Everglades, same color.  Factory which!!!  I love seeing Bec laugh!!!!  You will need the tractor during the winter.  I suggest next time get one with a cabin and heater.  What attachments you will need during the winter and future projects?  Toronto?  Are you moving closer to family so they can help with the baby girl?  My best wishes to both of you.
I'm so happy you made it through your cancer and you-all survivor and now you bringing a beautiful life in this world congratulations you deserve it y'all deserve it you're going to make amends and parents❤😊
Eamon is a _big sweet guy._ He gets it from his pop.
Fellow pregnant Canadian 😊. I have a 13 month old and I am currently 23 weeks pregnant.
Your videos cheer us up! Beautiful family and life! But, are you selling the cabin and moving to Toronto? What have we missed??😊❤
Watching your videos is so heartwarming. It’s my Sunday dose of wholesomeness. I wish you both so much joy with your new baby 🥰
You're moving to Toronto???????????????????????????????????????
Love the pathway.  You might want to consider growing creeping phlox or clover or another low growing flower with the grass.  Crazy to think you are only 14 weeks away from welcoming baby Fitz into the family!  So exciting!
Why are you moving to Toronto?? You are so much safer in that beautiful place you live in now
She def can blame everything on pregnancy brain bc it is a real thing and it realllllly does affect us.😂😂😂😂
You have both had such a missive past couple of years. I have no doubt you will thrive on this next journey and raise the most beautiful, creative, hard working, adventurous kids. I can’t wait to see whatever you decide to share with us 💛
I just love your vlogs! I love the editing and the creative shots and drone shots and just seeing your life! I’m also exactly 26.5 weeks pregnant, our baby girl is due Dec 27 and it’s our first baby too 🥰  My husband says the same thing when I put the oil on 😂
My husband calls me Honey.  My grandaugther picked up on it and she started to call me Honey.  I love it.  16 years and I am my grandaughter's Honey!!!!  My husband still call me Honey every day.
I cackled laughed so loud when you went from the deer peeing to slurping your drink. I woke my cat and now she’s mad and death staring me
Bec, you are radiant!  My baby is 30, but I remember the pregnancy like it was only yesterday. I kept a journal through my pregnancy to help me recall all the ups and downs. Enjoy this special season of life. Your life will very different in a few short months.
It’s been 6 months? 😨
Yaaay🎉 I wait for Sundays for your videos!! I’m pregnant also! 26w5d & in North Dakota 🤗 It makes me so happy to hear about your pregnancy experience! And to see your little family THRIVING!❤
Can you do an updated house tour at some point because you guys have like changed it so much it feels like
I'm 38 weeks and 2 days today. I'm feeling exhausted and I'm so ready for baby to be out. I'll be induced in about a week if baby hasn't arrived naturally. Prayers for you during your pregnancy journey!
You are moving?
Bec, you are such a beautiful woman.  Pregnancy brings out the glow in you!!!
I didn't want to say anything but I couldn't help it.....this is one of my favorite shows...keep up the great work!!!!!
Pregnant with a baby boy due the day before you guys 🥰 I feel you with the hip pain!!
I love watching your videos. To survive breast cancer and now 6 months pregnant, you are a strong woman. God bless you both.
I wanted to let you and Eamon know that i think you guys are thee most down to earth,  authentic, genuine couple on social media right now. I'm so happy for you, Eamon and Oso about that little bundle of joy you are going to have. You guys will make AWESOME parents and I'm sure Oso will become your little girls protector and friend. Bec, you are an inspiration to all women and Eamon you are a role model in the way you treat Bec. I wish you nothing but positive thoughts and energy and may God Bless you, Eamon, your baby girl and Oso with love, health, peace and happiness always. Best Wishes and Congratulations!!!!🙏🏻💙👶🐾
Y'all are simply glowing.
Hey Bec for your leg cramps try Therawork relief muscle cramp & spasm relief. It's a foam you rub on it takes the cramps out of leg in about a minute.
Rhianna Lee, hello
Overcomplicating our lives for our future child just because we’re extraaa 💅
As a young cancer survivor seeing you so happy, healthy and about to start a family makes me feel so good and grateful for second chances life gives us.  I was diagnosed with lymphoma at age 28, and I was newly married. I’m in remission now and every day I think about having my first baby as soon as possible! I send you hugs 🤗❤️
I’m so overjoyed for this baby!!! Eamon, so amazing your thoughts on Bec carrying baby.  I played your comment of Food, Shelter and Sex to my husband and he agrees…. He said what more could a guy need :). You 2 are going to be the best parents!!
Believe me, Oso is NOT going to sit on the baby. Dogs are really good about that, and Oso looks like a really good dog.  Also, try bananas for those leg cramps. Potassium does wonders.
I have a 4 month old and a 16 month old right now! I’m so glad you’re enjoying pregnancy, I’m so glad I’m not anymore!! I honestly hated it. But my kids are so so worth it. I’m an ultrasound tech so I think I am just jaded to it sometimes. But!! I love being a mom ❤️
Love watching you too. You guys are so sweet and so in love and I like the way you don’t share every little bit of everything❤ my daughter is almost one year free of breast cancer, but every time she has a scan I just pray and pray and pray, and she gets through it..so far so good.❤❤ love your cabin in the woods. You’ve done a spectacular job. I did hear that you were moving to Toronto 😮wherever you go you’ll make a house a home 🏠 loving hugs from me and Otis🐶 Massachusetts
Our dog eats rocks too, crazy dogs. It fine they’ll just poop it out🪨 Also my hips started hurting with my first baby, sleeping became a real chore towards the end, one of my breast got bigger then the other also… our bodies are crazy and amazing but everything that’s happening it totally normal.  I have 4 grown children now and my hips still hurt but you are in much better shape than I was so you should be fine❤️ The sacrifices of a mother ❤
Just curious, do you get a copyright strike for using the Barbie movie footage? I can’t get away with using a few seconds of a song without getting one!
You have a place Tronto?
I just had my baby 4 weeks ago and my sister and friend are both pregnant! I highly recommend pelvic floor physio it helped me so much for my second pregnancy! Also you can totally blame pregnancy brain for everything!
22 weeks tomorrow! 2 ER trips. HG and servers headaches. I love being pregnant though and wouldn’t trade it for anything!
You two are just adorable. Thank you for sharing your life with us.
I'm so envious,you two :::: ahem four! Are so blooming ,get it) delicious . Becks you amaze me! Your little girl will grow up so happy ,and hopefully healthy! You got this! ENJOY 😘🤗 sue from UK 🇬🇧
It's amazing how much physical work this guy can do considering he's nothing but skin and bones. I bet he has terrible joint problems when he gets older.
That is one lucky little girl having you, Eamon & Oso 🐾 as her family, Many Blessings! 🙏 💕
This video makes me happy 😊
24 weeks pregnant today ❤❤❤
Moving to Toronto?? Why is this the first I have heard of this?  Why?
This video just brought me so much joy, I'm so happy for you two and I can just FEEL your guys' positive energy! This totally made my Sunday and you two are some of my favorite people on this platform <3
when i first started watching youre channel, i wasnt sure if id stick around because i just live such a different lifestyle and different vibe than you guys, but as ive found, i genuinely love you guys. i cry with you, i laugh with you, i worry with you, ive prayed for you. seeing where you guys are now compared to years ago, is almost overwhelming. im sitting here in tears for no reason, other than how happy i am that you guys are doing so well. thank you for taking us along this and all the other journeys. big love from california
My granddaughter is 10 weeks pregnant  and only 100 pounds... she finally ate good today
Ok, I don't have the words to express my admiration and respect for Eamon. He is a genius at everything he does. He is the most loving, caring and special man I have ever seen...and he even cooks! We need to clone this guy. He's also genuinely fun and funny. Good Lord, I want me one just like him minus the facial hair 😁 what an incredible, super amazing man. BRAVO👏
Why are they moving to Toronto-baby?
Are you guys still going to find a place in Mexico?
For leg cramps take magnesium!
Great looking path way
I love watching you guys I just had to tell you I look forward to your shows it takes me away from this horrible world for a little while!! Thanx 💜🙏🏻💕
Very happy for you guys I've been here since 2018 ❤
😅26 years ago I was pregnant twins. I had bad hip pains you mentioned as well as back pains. All corrected when I gave birth (naturally). Hang in there.  All worth it!
😍
Your moving to Toronto?! What did I miss something?! :)
Maybe Osso needs a mineral supplement so he doesn’t eat rocks.
You guys are moving to Toronto
You're so beautiful.  Love your channel. I'm super happy for you guys!!
Love you guys so much !!!
YAY YOU HAVE A DOULA!!!
So excited for you both about baby girl and Bec is showing more. Eamon great job on the walkway. Love y'all and thank you so much as enjoy watching.
I worked for a small animal vet. 2 summers in a row, we removed rocks from a yellow labs tummy. He was an Army Generals dog. It was funny because he couldn’t reason with his dog!! Oso might be looking for a mineral or something from the ground he’s not getting from his food!
My German shepherd always ate rocks! 😂 I also sunk when trying to float pregnant 😂 Your body has no idea what's happening in the water lol
Omygoodness you look fabulous Bec it's such a joy watching you two beautiful humans enjoying life
Pregnancy brain: you have 2 brains & neither of them are working 😂😂😂 pregnancy is willldddd
I’m 9 months postpartum with my 5th child. It is a lot on the body but it’s worth it!  If you hear one thing - do it your way way! Do your own research so you are informed & your best is enough. Congratulations again!
❤ seeing Bec so healthy
💕💞💓💗💘
I love your vídeos. Gods bless you guys🙏🏼
Eamon & Bec have “jumped the shark.”
Hi frenz
Magnesium/calcium/VitD and extra iron supplements almost cured my calf cramps and restless leg syndrome!
Love
Cafe pain means you need a banana your low on potassium
What is this “moving to Toronto” that was mentioned?
Osso is chasing the Window seat lol,
HEY for calf cramps grab your toes and pull them towards your hips ✌️🤙💜
Was wondering how amorous Bec was getting haha most people are too scared to talk about it 😄 🤣 😂
Thanks for the update! Please, please, while you both have time for such projects, consider baby-proofing your walkway down to the lake now, by putting a baby / toddler proof security gate in place.  Yes, of course y’all will start teaching the soon-to-be little bundle of joy to swim, as soon as, she is able to start!   Also, please eventually remember to teach her to not go outside w/out your “permission”, so Oso won’t lead her on a short walk away from the house area.  A similar story in the last 2 days, in the news, here in the USA; took hours to find the little toddler. & will keep her safe while vehicles are backing up.  Most children start walking around their 1st birthday.  Hopefully, y’all already have a “Master Project List” started, so no missed or forgotten of things you want to remember & do will be skipped.   Continue to enjoy every minute of your changing lives & take tons of photos!.  😊
Oso is gonna be the best big brother ever 💙🐕👶💗
Hip and pelvic pain is just your body adjusting to the hormones. Your bump is so cute. You are going to pop this baby out and go back to a flat belly. My advice as someone who has been through multiple cancers and 12 pregnancies is rest when you can. If your tired, nap. Your so lucky to have such a supportive partner. Enjoy.
Bec, you look amazing! So healthy & strong. My one concern for you is that you do not get a covid vaccine! One of my friends who had cancer was told by her Dr. "Not to get the vaccine. That it could affect her health. (Immune system). I know some may disagree but there is a lot we do not know about this vaccine! Just want you to stay strong & healthy & cancer free.❤
You all are moving??? I missed that announcement! Why?
P.s. this summer when I received my b.c diagnosis I thought about all you have endured. I am older with children and you really have had to face so many more challenges. What I’m trying to say is you are a great role model and having listened and followed your journey made the burden much lighter. So proud of you and so happy for the 3 of you! Pls rest, no more company and prepare. Take good care! Xo
Been here for a long time and im a 13 year breast cancer survivor. God never gives you more than you can handle. You're A Badass n Your Gonna Be The Best Mommy Ever.... Stay Safe Guys . Mucho Love From Your Friend In Michigan Tam 💜💕💜
20:11 Turn the hot tub down to an okay temperature for her!!!
Absolutely loved the vibe of this video! Just felt like we were hanging out and joining you for a day. Your realness is always appreciated and my wife and I always feel happier after watching. See you sunday!
For the calf cramps you got to pop a magnesium pill before bed. Game changer never had another one if I took it
Chica, you look beautiful!
You should use sand for the pavers.
I absolutely adore your "defying the odds" vibe and your love for each other, Oso, the baby and the world around you guys 🥰🥲
Hi family.   Another great visit. See you next Sunday xxxxx
Really popping now!
Lol the title
Is there a substitute for tofu.  Soy is a bad choice for me with my Lupus.  I am not a vegan, but open to it.
Happy Sunday you are just glowing sweetheart.  I am just so excited for you both as you continue your wonderful pregnancy.  Blessings ❤❤
Lol my dog eats rocks too. I even find them in my bed!
Eamon did you ever consider to give up what Bec has to give up? You know in solidarity. And for support?!
Careful. My sister had to take her dog to the emergency vet because he was eating gravel and they had to open him up.
I choked laughing when Bec said Oso was “taking the fence and running away.”  Thanks for making my Sunday again 😘
Bec, I was told to have a banana or a LITTLE  bag of salted chips before bed. Something about the magnesium helps with the cramping calves. And I know you guys really promote the healthier lifestyle and diet, but I couldn't have been happier when Eamon showed Bec's "sweet stash", I had a HUGE smile because you suddenly became real and normal and I can identify with a "sweet stash", even if I am not pregnant and I am 54! lmao
Food shelter and sex
I bet Osho said  “speak for yourself buddy”!
You two are seriously amazing!! You’re both so lucky to have found each other ❤
I guess you're getting masses of advice but my fav book was Three In a Bed - Why You Should Sleep With Your Baby by Deborah Jackson. I read it for my second.
Yay!!! Looking good. So happy for y'all.
❤❤❤ oh my goodness look at that baby bump aww
I just love watching you two complete a project! ❤
21 weeks pregnant! Was the matron of honor in a wedding this weekend and I’m EXHAUSTED. My body feels like I was fighting someone haha
😂😂😂 the barbie cuts got me good
You have been through so much and watching you grow into a mom is absolutely amazing and also eamon grow into a girl dad is amazing too. I would have been 6 mths today but our little boy is in heaven. So I understand all the pain and pressure your going through
😻
Hey guys! Just to let you know- acorns are toxic to dogs and can make their tummies really upset! Be careful if Oso tries to eat them :) Much love to you all
I just had my first baby at the end of December and am so excited for y’all! It truly is THE BEST THING EVER! You will enjoy your little girl so much, even though it may feel hard at times, it really is so worth it. I’m so grateful you get to go through this, especially since your last years difficult.
Fun video! Glad all is well!
Tank you for sharing your days with us.  Good job on the rocks.  You are living in some very lovely surroundings.  Looking forward to seeing the little girl.  Stay safe.  ♥
You look wonderful!
Loving the bump and LOVING your hair Bec!!!
When I was going through hormonal changes..pregnancy then late in life menopause,  cilantro tasted like soapy mud. Once my hormones returned to normal, I was back to loving it.
Brinlee would be a beautiful name for baby girl! Honoring lee 😊
Your couple is very inspiring. Watching from Moscow, Russia
Ask if calcium, magnesium, potassium, zinc, vitamin D3 would be ok to take for leg cramps.
try magnesum it may help with cramping in the calves
I’m 62 years old. Until I had a client who was in the ICU for over a week and we weren’t sure would survive, I never called anyone honey except for a romantic partner.
That's a very big yes on dogs eat rocks. we had a dog that would run up to the fire works and grab them in her mouth. One time she grab a roman candle and run around with it as it was going off. Yes we were all running from her. but she thought it was a game....so after that we preferred her to eat rocks.
❤❤❤ 🎉 excellent job of staying positive through all the trials Bec and good job 😮 and for being such a supportive loving caring husband father and kind human being I think even though no relationship is perfect and crap happens I think that you to share love that's just beautiful and it should be honored🎉❤❤❤
😘😘😘😘
Great attempt at a gorgeous stone pathway! It"ll happen! How cold was the water swimming? Becs 6 month looks beautiful on her! Happy nesting you two! Chef does amazing work in the kitchen!❤❤❤
Hi Bec …. from New Mexico 🇺🇸  My daughter is due with my first grandchild in February. You remind me so much of her - you both have the same birthday 6/29 and have a similar build… so it has been fun watching your Lil Bump grow … a preview of how my daughter’s Bump will look like in a couple of months!  And she is having a girl also! They live 9 hours away so I really love following your journey- makes me feel even more connected with my daughter across the miles  ❤❤❤❤
I am 6 months postpartum, and the worst part of being pregnant was the calf cramps!! I collaborated with my doctor and Endocrinologist (as I also have hyperthyroidism, which also increases my risk for said cramps), and we decided to have me take extra magnesium everyday until about 1 week postpartum as you do remain a lil stiff and swollen afterwards. It was a game changer. I went from waking up in the middle of the night screaming because nothing I did would make the cramps stop, to rarely getting them. Also, compression socks that go over your calves as well feel so refreshing. I definitely recommend them.
U R such a Cute pg lady. :)).
Awe, Bec think Eamon is sexy on his tractor! 😂❤
You guys are awesome!  What a wonderful family, sending big love from Melbourne Australia 🥰❤️
Great video! Wishing you well
There’s nothin more beautiful than the glow of an expecting mother.
Bec- a chiropractor can take that hip pain away. I had it so bad my first 2.5 pregnancies before I finally took a friend's advice and saw a chiro. Instant pain relief if I went every few weeks. My 4th pregnancy i started with the chiro at the first sign of hip pain and it never got bad!
Hi guys ye look so so happy ❤❤❤
So glad to see you recovered and bringing a little baby into your life. I always had a feeling that you and Eamon would make it through the cancer scare. Looking forward to seeing that beautiful baby girl in just a few months.
You guys are adorable!! Baby girl is going to love the cabin life. And the tractor!!❤  Good job Bec!!
Move to Ontario?!?!
Love that feeling of the baby moving around. As a heads up, this might be the thing you miss the most about being pregnant. I wasn’t prepared for how empty I felt once the baby was born.
You’re definitely looking great. Love the baby bump. I’m glad you’re doing good. Glad you’re keeping busy. It’s been a long time since I was pregnant. Almost 31 years ago. Now I’m a grandma of almost 7 grandchildren some by marriage.  Keep up the amazing attitude it helps. Sending positive vibes and lots of love and happiness
I would have put the gravel between the stones, for low maintenance.  The stones look great.
There are plants/ herbs that can you can grow around the paving stones so you don’t have to mow. You guys are such hard workers and the pathway looks great!!!
You need a weed barrier because everywhere there’s foil there will be weeds. Great job to both of you.
You guys are totally adorable, I am old enough to be your grandma. You have created a gorgeous home. You have a lovely relationship and I’m sure you will have a happy, healthy baby. I just have one question how come you are not planting vegetables and fruit trees in your yard?
Bec, I love how excited Eamon was when you found out that you're pregnant, and how understanding and appreciative he is of what you're going through being pregnant. You are the sweetest, most loving couple. You're going to be awesome parents!! ❤❤
Wait, you’re moving to Toronto?? What did I miss and how did I miss it, I watch every video.
Wait, I missed something. Moving to Toronto?
Love the path  🇦🇺👍🥰❤️
🐥 🍼
Did Bec say they are moving to Toronto?  Was this discussed in prior videos.  What's the scoop? Just for the winter?
Pregnancy brain is real
Congrats on the growing family. You look gorgeous Bec!.  I do have a question though about your pregnancy snacks lol.. Aren't you Vegan?
Been there got the t-shirt weight until they get older University is not cheap but I couldn't do without them
You may want to space the stones closer together because the baby’s steps will be WAY closer together 💛
I have a 2 month old and just went through the pregnancy journey. Even thought I had to get up every hour to pee nothing prepares you for waking up every 2 hours with a newborn. But it gets better this is just a phase in your lives. The best day I had was when I met my son.
Please please please research the carnivore diet and how important animal fats and protein are for your brain and your babies brain, not to mention hormones and bone development. I was Vegan off and on and damaged my health, teeth and once I went carnivore I realised the government guidelines are wrong and I also damaged my children, anxiety and depression as well as their development. My son is intellectually disabled and has been diagnosed with schizophrenia but since going carnivore he is off his meds and calm with lots of energy. I can’t help but wonder about the cancer journey and the link to seed oils and metabolic health, please please for your future health just research carnivore from those who have experienced the long term health benefits. God bless you both and your little girl, praying for you. X
I am sitting here in Queensland Australia drinking my first cup of coffee with a big smile on my face Eamon and Bec are here too. So say I admire you Bec is an understatement you make my heart  smile your courage your honesty  and the true love that Eamon has in his eyes for you is the most precious thing you can  have your baby girl is going to be the cherry on the top. Much love never change  Oso is the cutest too. ❤️❤️🇦🇺🇦🇺👍👍🥰🥰🥰
God! I just love you guys!!!can’t wait for that baby!!🥰🥰🥰😇
are you guys moving to Toronto permanently?
15 weeks here first pregnancy as well💜 Super excited and can’t wait to be a mom!
Can I ask if you guys think you'll have more merch available soon?  🥺
All normal ! I'm a OB NURSE ,  relaxin causes hip pain due to the ligaments, expanding from the relaxant hormone
You guyssss….these are my favorite videos yet. You guys are so blessed! Healed of cancer and expecting a miracle baby. Your videos are making me cry lol! I love seeing your joy❤
I'm a mama of 6 and those leg cramps are the worst. :) I never had any luck with remedy's until my 5th.  A bath a night with some Epsom salt (the scented ones are lovely! did wonders! Ebsom salts are full of magnesium, and magnesium is absorbed most easily through the skin. :) Sending prayers and love your way.
SO HAPPY FOR YOU TWO !❤
We look forward to your videos each week. After watching today,  I feel like I have to go tackle an outside project I have been putting off for months! I heard you say you were moving to Toronto. Maybe I missed a video, I haven't heard that before!
My dog eats rocks all the time. Then he pukes them up in little surprise piles in the house.
Enjoy it while you can because that’s all good change when she comes into the world. You won’t be waking up late anymore or much sleep at all. Don’t know from personal experience but I’ve had player friends who had babies.
Bec... you look amazing I’m so happy for you! God bless💜🙏🏻💕
👍🏾💯❤️👍🏾💯❤️👍🏾💯❤️. Hugz
I know my day is going to be great when I see y'all have posted!! Love your channel!!
My dog used to eat rocks, dirt, and sticks.    I looked it up said bc he was a rescue he was looking for nutrients bc he was scared he wouldn’t eat again.  My Charlie eats better than me 😂.  He grew out of it within a year.    I tried throwing a ball to distract him when I noticed it.  All dogs are different
🍁💕☀️🍄🌾🐾🫶💕 I can’t even- stopping to help the turtle across the road- swoon- you both are such great peeps- thanks for sharing your journey!
why are you moving to Toronto and will you sell the cabin?
Lovely to see you Bec & Eamon.  💕 your Garden path very pretty 😍  Great to hear your pregnancy update 6 months already going quickly 😜  Have a Good week🥰
I just love your videos there always a joy to watch!!  I love how open and honest your channel is. You guys have the best relationship! Love how you show us the projects your working on. The cabin is so amazing. Tour hard work has definitely paid off. The walk way looks GREAT!!Also...O-so is the cutest he has the best personality ❤ Thanks for sharing your lives with us!!
Min 3:20…. Sexual pose 😂 Im just saying 😂
I am loving following your journey.  I met you through following Max and Occy.  Your site became very relevant to me when I was diagnosed with breast cancer in July.  I am 1/3 of the way through my chemo, and it was very helpful to watch Bec go through her journey and come out the other end with such great success.  Very happy for you both with the upcoming child that will be a part of your family. Blessings on you all.
I am on the same timeline as you Bec, my due date is Christmas Day! It is so fun watching you go through this at the same time as me! ❤
I am also pregnant with a girl and my first baby, 25 weeks today!  I am considered high risk due to a short cervix after an abnormal Pap smear last year that showed precancerous cells, so part of my cervix had to be removed. However the surgery was successful and my follow up paps have been normal!  Experiencing hip pain, extreme tiredness and a lot of heart burn. The increase of hormone’s definitely make me feel more emotional and lonely too. My cravings haven’t been crazy but in the beginning of my pregnancy I always wanted jalapeño chips, but now I’ve got the biggest sweet tooth! Ice cream, cake, cinnamon rolls, you name it I want it!
Hey Bec, You are such an inspiring lady!! I also had the same symptoms of waking up with cramps in my calves and also really bad pelvic girdle pain (also known as SPD) from 13 weeks, unfortunately was nothing I could help to relieve either pains. Other then heat packs for my pelvis and sleeping with a pillow between my legs. I feel for you, it really is a tricky journey but so so worth it and special. Us women are super humans ❤
Bec, don’t forget bio oil round your hips and back, that’s where my sneaky 3rd trimester stretch marks appeared 😢
I love seeing your pregnancy journey! I’m just ending my first trimester. You guys are going to be amazing parents and a little jealous that your daughter is going to be growing up in such a beautiful place!
guys dont worry my dog also eats and sometimes swallows rocks love the videos and love watching here in london  ❤
You can lower the water temp in the hot tub and do some water exercise   .
When you said you were moving to Toronto.... just for Winter/Spring or more permanently? How long a drive is it from TO to your cabin in the woods? Will the cabin be your second home then?
Love you guys so much
So did the swim help? :) It’s been so fun watching y’all’s journey of your first pregnancy. Y’all definitely deserve all of these good moments! Much love from Texas! 🫶
I love how the shorter becs hair is the curlier it is!! That short length looks so freakin good on her!! Love love love this glow!❤️
You guys are just so fearless about tackling everything. I never had the confidence at your age to just do the things you do. You will make the most awesome parents
You are AMAZING, Bec! Thank you for sharing your journey! You are brave, strong, and going to be a mama!!! oH....and Eamon is amazing too. 😆
Fun fun fun!!   You two are so much fun. Baby girl will add a million times more fun.  Do you follow “ leave everything and wander”  with their baby girl Luce?  You have so much fun ahead of you.💖💖🤗🤗👍👍🙏🙏
THE DEER AND SLURPING THE SMOOTHIE IM DEAD! Love you guys
Careful about that swallowing of rocks.  We had a dog that did that, it impacted in his colon and he started having seizures.  One expensive surgery later and he was on meds the rest of his life.
Awww Lee 💛
Careful with the dog eating rocks. They grind their teeth right down.
My due date is about a week before yours. Eamon pregnancy brain is so real!
Move to Toronto? What did I miss….??
You look amazing and I’m so so happy for you all!!! Well done, keep going! Much love from Tasmania xxx
14 weeks with first baby and just heard the heartbeat for the first time last week! 🤍 Feeling really good without much nausea so far, but definitely have switched from a non-sleep-in person, to that's the only way to do morning 😅
Our dog swallowed a rock and had a blockage that needed surgery because of it.  Now I am super paranoid and make him drop everything.
Leg cramps can be low magnesium.
It's funny when Eamon says "his neck hurts. You are turning into a father, Eamon." lol
Bec you are truly glowing 😊
You look cute pregnant! 😍  When are you all moving to Toronto?
Can we live in your cabin after you move to Toronto???  It's amazing!
Imagine living in van prego, that be so hard
Banana or apple cider vinegar helped me with leg cramps. Mine were severe and I used to mix about an inch of vinegar into a glass then top it with honey and water then sip this through the day. You get used to the flavour pretty quickly
Watching from  Cookeville Tennessee. I'm a home caregiver so I just got off work so I'm just now getting to watch.  I have 24 and 17-year-old boys.  I  love your videos and  you are so inspiring.
Good times. Fun to see you enjoying life, pregnancy.  One thing, you got randomly shaped stones but tried to lay then symmetrically.😜 They were meant to be laid randomly.  But you had fun doing it.😊
Them rock will kill him you guys
Agree with the dragonfly ❤ I have one for my husband and son ❤❤ I know they come visit me all the time! And it brings me peace 🙏❤️
Your house looks like heaven !  😍🥰
Hi. Thank you for sharing your journey. You are amazing!
Bec, your positivity is seriously so contagious! Im 25 weeks pregnant today, and you've encouraged me to get up and do some early nesting! Can't wait to see the walkway update <3
Hi Eamon & Bec, love you guys and love all your videos. God bless you and your family 🙏🏻❤️😘👍👍👍👍👍👍
My retriever constantly cheqs on and swallows rocks. Makes me so nervous 😂
Happy that the “ bump” is doing well 😊
HOW DID YOU GET MINI EGG IN THE MIDDLE OF THE YEAR ???!!!! sorry i really want to know i love mini eggs
..Mr.Eamon  can be a very good contractor or something...😂
Happy Sunday Bec and Eamon you both look so great especially Bec pregnancy update I enjoy seeing your videos
Here since the beginning of the beginning if that makes sense😂. I'm so happy for you guys😭😭❤❤❤❤❤❤
So lovely to see you both and enjoying daily life with a new pathway thrown in … Oso is so precious….So happy the pregnancy is going so well take care ❤
❤
My boy used to eat rocks and stones, like alot and not just the odd nibble, it turned out he was in lacking minerals. I changed his kibble to a higher vitamin and mineral content one and started doing more vege in his meat n vege cook ups (carrot, broccoli, zuchini and silverbeet), and he hasn't eaten a stone since. Also add a quarter teaspoon of tumeric powder to his food each day and that's made him extra healthy too 😊
So excited for your little one to arrive and watch your journey as you become parents! Our little guy is 1 month old and it’s the best thing ever!  Pregnancy, sleepless nights and all of the struggles that come with growing a human are so worth it! ❤
My son and his girlfriend are also having a girl and due late January (25th), they will be 6 months in October. My daughter's dog jama chews stones too
You were talking about leg cramps. I used to get horrible knots in my calves when I was pregnant. My ob  recommended bananas. That helped me.
😎🥰❤️‍🔥💖💗💫💥💜💙💋🧡💞❤
Emon is the Canadian Gordon Ramsey of cooking. Great video everyone.
yes we had a doggy that tried to pick up the foundation of the house when we were renovating (RIP Wallie), and we would always catch him chewy on rocks half his size. He was a mini weiner dog 🫶🏼
MILF
2nd trimester next week. The hardest 12 weeks ever! The 1st trimester is no joke! Hoping for more energy soon 🎉
sugar like oreos and stuff like that is bad sugar is bad sugar for humans it mean is bad sugar for baby its better sugar from fruits like natural sugar
Thank you!
Eamon in the kitchen is 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Move to Toronto? What did I miss?!
Hi, been following for a few years now. I have 5 kids and currently pregnant with Twins. Due 12/7 but will be induced 2 weeks earlier due to being twins. I personally feel very squished inside. Very different than with Singleton pregnancies.
You both are awesome but please don't eat leftover rice and/or microwaved rice esp. for Bec
I’ve been here since the beginning and would Iike to say thank you for letting us be a little part of your journey
When you guys moving to Toronto? 😀
Love your videos!
My dog also eats rocks😂
Her name must be: Buddy Lee! Buddy Lee! Buddy Lee!
WHAT.....??? Moving to Toronto??!!! Selling your beautiful home on the lake?!!!!
Calf pain is usually from an electrolyte imbalance . I would drink some electrolytes or pickle juice !!
No doubt at all you and your body have been through a lot Bec but pregnancy suits you and you are 'blooming' wonderfully. so cute seeing Ozo trying to avoid the gravel at all times, my dog was the same x
Lovely to see you doing well. When dogs eat stones, it’s a sign. They need Marrowbone get him a nice big bone that he can chew on and eat the marrow take care
Love you guys! Always wishing you the best ❤
Where is the “buying New bronco’ video lol
Bec you look gorgeous!!! You guys are such a team with everything you do!!! Can't wait to see you become parents!!
God is AMAZING!!
Should I be concerned about my mental health as I’m crying at 33 seconds into this video? 😂 ❤
Soo happy for you three xp
Watching from Minnesota.  I'm so happy for you guys. The cabin looks more amazing every time I see it! Bec you are just glowing! Did I miss something though? I heard Bec say something about a move to Toronto? Will that be your main residence once baby is here?  Thanks for sharing so much with us. Wishing you tmso much happiness! Bec, have you thought about Journaling these last couple of months of pregnancy just so you can look back later and remember all the wonderful,  crazy feelings and cravings?
How I desperately want them to  name Baby Girl. Buddy! Buddy Lee!!!!
I’ve been watching since 2018. Love you guys!!!
Cadbury is the best chocolate ever!!! Here in the UK it is the main chocolate and nothings better than a Cadbury chocolate bar. I love you guys and I can't wait for your baby girl to come along xxx
3:16 ‘PREGNANCY BRAIN’ …… I love how the Americans and Canadians call it ‘PREGNANCY BRAIN’ whereas us Brits call it ‘BABY BRAIN’ 🤣🤣👶🏻🧠🤰🏼
I somehow missed an episode or something.... You're moving to Toronto??? Is it just until the baby is born so you're close to the hospital? I would take your 6 months pregnant body over my 61 year old menopausal one in a heartbeat. You look gorgeous. You'll be glad you documented the transition. I survived mostly on croissants and fruit filled danish my first pregnancy. ☮&💜
I am 37.5w right now with my second baby girl. I feel like a massive blimp. I can see her feet sticking out of my skin right above my belly button. I can't sleep at night but I would love to nap all day.
How has it been 6 months since I watched your video on finding out your pregnant?!
Love ur place cant believe u want to move back to the city 🤷‍♀️
You can put your legs in the hot tub or lower the temp
thank you so much for sharing your lives, much love to you both ❤❤❤❤
Where’s the fish in thag lake
Hey what happened with the permits for the wood stairs to go down to the dock?...
Bec, I just love you lots, but these brown pants you’re wearing in this video are not so pretty.  They’re so short.  Sorry!  Anyway, can’t wait for baby girl to arrive.  Love Eamon & Oso lots too.  ❤️❤️❤️  Also, youse guys are one of the funniest couples I follow on YouTube.  You both crack me the heck up.  Bec, aka Eamon’s Lady ☺️, you look amazing and beautiful for being 6 months pregnant.
Bec you are absolutely glowing!! I’m so happy for you and Eamon. I cannot wait to see your birth of your daughter!!
I could not be happier seeing you Sunday
its gread to follow you 2. see you2 next week
It’s wonderful to see you so happy and healthy! Being a mom is the best thing you could ever do. Enjoy every moment you have. They grow up so fast.
Through all the years that I have watched you you have always made me feel like I was right there with you you’re acting or your lifestyle is wonderful and I wish I had this same opportunities that you do congratulations and keep up the good work
love you gus so much ❤ you're both precious
Bec your skin is radiant during this pregnancy 🥰 Oso is gonna be a great big brother to that angel. I honestly can’t wait to hear your name for her bc I have been calling her Aspen Leigh 😂
Have to give some props to Oso he is such a good well trained and behaved boy!  Good job Eamon and Bec!
I gotta see the rest of the path in the next episode
Does anyone know what kind of car eamon is driving?
Love the whittakers chocolate 🍫❤ 🍫❤️
Honey is not good for dogs!
I’m 34 yrs postpartum 😂🤣 Those were very wonderful times. Blessings to you guys 💖 Drink milk for your leg cramps.
You can do 15 minutes in a hot tub.   I used them my entire pregnancy.   Yo just can’t stay in them long.
So so happy for you guys!…will make great parents!…🌈😘😘❤️
Hi Eamon & Bec love watching you guy's, so good  together it warms my ❤,watching from Dublin Ireland 🇮🇪
First off, I love you guys SO freaking much & y’all will be the best parents ever! 💜 I had a miscarriage right after Mother’s Day; found out I was pregnant again at the end of June 🌈 but then 2 days after finding out got the results back for my thyroid biopsy which were “suspicious for thyroid cancer” I already have a 4 year old & am now 17 weeks with my second beautiful baby girl. I go to Duke soon to have more tests done, but as of now I’ll be having surgery after giving birth, to have my thyroid removed. Trying to stay positive & just pray everything works out & I’ll be okay & be here with my girls for a long, long time 🫶🏼 much love & good vibes your way Bec ✨
My best boy Fenway Parker, ate rocks...lucky for us and him he pooped them out!  No surgery needed, 🙏 It did freak me out at times.
You are both doing amazing ❤
I would of planted some ground cover thyme, between the stone steppers, which smells wonderful every time you or Oso steps on it.      🐾👣🐾👣🐾👣🐾👣🐾👣🐾 Also, I planted several different rosemary plants and other herbs.  I loved it when my dogs traveled through the garden,,  I could always tell which part of the garden my dogs were in by the different scents of rosemary or other herbs. The dogs smelled so nice.
Can’t wait to see how OSO responds to the baby
Pathway looks so nice. When did you get the bronco, and get rid of truck ?
Awww look at Becs baby bump…. So adorable
"You know when you see a really pretty landscaped house? That's gonna be this."   You two are so adorable ❤😅
Yes, my English Setter Sadie eats rocks and dirt. I discovered this habit when she was a pup. I had a arrowhead display on my desk and noticed one missing. Discovered it on the deck in pieces....😅
Sounds like you need a bio magnesium supplement. Yes pelvic stretching etc is ‘normal’ in pregnancy but the calf cramps indicate possible mg deficiency ❤️✨
Eamon and Bec!! I don’t comment often but have been a huge fan for like forever. Truly love you both and am so happy to see you in this new chapter. Not sure if you remember me, I photographed you in the Oregon coast back in 2018(??) lol can’t remember. My love for you guys has only grown. Thank you for sharing your life with us. ❤❤❤
Why are you moving to Toronto?
The wife's 3 months post partum today with our first son ! All I can say is that it Iis a rollercoaster and no matter how much we prepared and people told us the only way to be ready is to love that baby no matter who or what comes out. Times can get frustrating but the best advice I got was through all the crying and screaming and late nights how could someone with hands these small be doing these things to hurt or get at you. They just need love and care even especially at the worst nights at 3:30 am when you have 0 sleep!
Bananas and/or gatorade ie potassium helped the night time leg cramps so much when I was pregnant Bec!
Oso would like you to place his bowl gently, lol.
We’ve been to the hospital twice today but my wife wasn’t dilated enough about to head back soon! Enjoy your journey!
I se u guy's enjoyed the Bear series, it's nice seeing u guy's hanging out
Anytime...
All of Oso's biiiig stretches make me so happy❤
Congratulations on all the milestones you have made it thru. Happy pregnancy 🤰
I'm pregnant with our second baby and I'm 27 weeks! Think we are due around the same time? We are having a girl also! Hi from the UK fellow baby bump 🤰👋
i love this so much this video is amazing!  and seeing you two go thru this together is so beautiful...there really isnt anything quite like your first baby.. so going thru all the little things and big changes together is truly amazing... its just so beautiful to see... ive been watching you guys for a very long time....since your first days in the van.... seeing this and seeing how much youve guys have grown is so cool seriously!  i have a 12 yr old daughter  now.... but have been trying to get pregnant since my daughters been able to talk and ask me for a little sister :) it hasnt happened for me yet.... but i keep hoping and praying that my little baby will come<3 i wish you guys so much happiness and love!!
You blow me away bec so excited for you and eamon plus oso!
Weird suggestion but I would definitely add some bio oil to your hips and butt as well. Just to be safe. You’ll be surprised at all the places that can stretch while pregnant. Much love to you 3🫶💖👨‍👩‍👧
You can't just drop a move to Ontario like THAT!! 😱 So what's the plan with the cabin then!?
This was so good! Love watching how much has happened in the past 5 years! 😭🫣🥹 over here 14 weeks and so excited to be watching you guys during this season ❤
Bec,  I am so happy for you! Thank you for sharing your amazing journey with us! When you were talking about her kicking around you reminded me of what Mom told me about. She said "I was a few months into my pregnancy with you and I was gettinng ready for bed. As I got into bed, you gave me a kick in my ribs and I jumped a foot off of the bed! I immediately said That is not a girl! That is a football player!" From then on she got only boy clothes and toys! I am excited for you both! Good luck and may God bless you!
I must’ve missed something. I didn’t know you were moving to Toronto. Is this just to be closer to a hospital in case you need it for delivery?
Santa Barbara, CA. Nice work!
It’s okay to complain when pregnant! ❤
Currently 31 weeks pregnant with baby boy🥰
You guys always make my day better thanks for the video! And just a sidenote, as someone trained in food safety, make sure that leftover rice comes up to safety temp long enough to kill all the bacteria so Beck and baby girl stay safe. Leftover rice can be dangerous. If it doesn’t come up to temp. Love you guys!
I love the story so much. It’s so cute and I’m glad beck  is doing good
I was just complaining about my dog eating rocks!
Awe! We say the same thing about my mother in law. That she comes as a dragonfly
What a great happy fun update !!!  You two deserve every positive moment that comes your way!!!!
I am 46 years postpartum.  😅  Brings back fond memories.
You're moving????
We got it good bubby food water shelter and se 😂
Bec, you look beautiful pregnant. Much Love and health to you both!
Bec, seeing your bump made me smile. Currently going through a miscarriage, but my aching heart is so happy for you! I think about you alot wondering if you’re ok. Praying for a continued healthy pregnancy for you!
Toronto??? how did I miss that??
When are you moving??
Our baby girl is due late Feb! 17 weeks today!
8:48  I wonder if dogs think some rocks are just tiny treats and they get blown away when they see a path of them! 😂
Bec is in a whole new era 🤍 what a good role model   Just grace and beauty every step of the way. Eamon you’re alright too hahahahaha (JK 😍😍)
Bec, a little extra turmeric may help your leg cramps .
Stress or anxiety in your dog may manifest into your dog eating rocks. Also, dogs eating non-food items is most often associated with gastrointestinal (GI) discomfort of some sort. And, finally --- a reason your dog might be eating pebbles is that your dog is deficient in phosphorus, calcium, or iron, or they could possibly have an enzyme deficiency. Your vet can test for deficiencies and tell you the best supplements to give them.
Looks amazing xo love you guys
Pickle juice for leg cramps!!works every time! ❤️
You and Eamon are very special too! And we love you both!
Dedicated to Eamon from Bec: On YouTube  Kenny Chesney- “She Thinks My Tractor’s Sexy”
That view is to die for!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The music editing through the swimming scene was awesome!
Currently 39 weeks pregnant. When I found out you were also pregnant, I couldn’t help my excitement knowing we were pregnant at the same time! And yes, you can use pregnancy brain and mom brain for anything and everything 😂
I’m 20 weeks with a baby girl as well! I love love love feeling her kick it’s my favorite thing in the whole world and even though pregnancy is hard sometimes, I am so glad I get to be the one who is pregnant. This is our rainbow baby after losing twins last year. With a bicornuate uterus and history of loss, this little girl is our miracle & I can’t wait to watch your little girl grow up while I watch my little girl grow up as well!
Pickle juice is supposed to be good for muscle cramps! 🥒
Greetings from Southern Minnesota, USA. Love following  your story. You are so funny. I've  been going through some  health issues lately and have been  feeling  down, so look forward  to your new videos! It's  great to see how excited you both are for your new daughter! Love you guys!
Mama is doing great ❤🎉🎉🎉
Keep thriving.. you are all amazing 🩵💞🐾
Hi Bec, we are due on the 21st of December. It's been wonderful, daunting, painful, and fun. We love feeling our little one kick and shuffle, but the rib and pelvic pain are real.   Eamon, Bec gets to 100% use pregnancy brain for EVERYTHING 😂
Great choice, we have the same pavers you chose but in a rust color for a walkway in front of our vintage 1920 farmhouse
Astounding!!  Thanks for catching us up!
did you know you can sleep train a baby in the womb. Just kinda poke your belly and wake the baby up when you want it awake and then it will sleep more when you sleep so you can actually get some rest. Now, obviously ask an obgyn about it before doing it but figured i would mention it.
Love this vlog ❤
Such a great video!! Bec, you’re incredible and so beautiful! So happy to see you so happy and your body growing this amazing little girl💕 Eamon, you’re so sweet to point out all that Bec is doing and how incredible women are💪🏼 Loved all that this video was!! Stay you✌🏼
Seeing you preg makes me sooo happy!!!!!💕🤗
There going to be a december baby
You guys rock! Enjoy your creativity and can do spirit! Lucky baby to have you as future parents.
PUHLEASE don’t use microwave!  It’s nuclear energy.  It’s only good use is a faraday box, hence the nuclear energy.  Try microwaving a cup of water for a couple of minutes, take it out, let it cool down, and see if you can grow a plant with that water.  You won’t be able to because the molecules were split apart.  PUHLEASE switch to a toaster oven to reheat your food.  Your body will thank you.  God bless you all.  🙏✝️
No more amazing feeling than that of ur baby growing inside you.  Becky you are such a strong positive person.  You guys have been through hell but the journey is about to change.  A mini you and ur man.  It doesn't get better than that.  Thank you for sharing.  You deserve to be happy.  God Bless You guys.  Take care
You guys are so much fun to watch!  I admire your compassion and consideration for animals, the environment and other humans.  As a Canadian (in Ontario) I am very proud of you both.
Ask your ob about Calm with Calcium.  My midwife recommended it for leg cramps.  It is basically calcium and magnesium. Major help with muscle cramps.  Helps with period cramps too.
Fun fact, Oso can hear your babies heartbeat and smell the baby inside you.... if you make him part of the pregnancy, he will look after and love baby girl forever.....
The solution to your calves cramping is potassium and magnesium. Don’t you just love the baby dancing on your cervix in toe shoes. If you ever wondered about your hips spreading, after your daughter is born you will literally run into everything with them because you wont be used to them being where they are. Counters, doorknobs, car doors… Sharp sticky outy hips are like suddenly having elbows where your hips used to be. Lol
9:06 as you are a person that loves DIY, a truck would have been a better choice. You can always get one and the Bronco would be Becs car. Plus you should have just put the walking stones on top of the gravel.
So excited for you guys. Congrats! Can't wait to see baby girl. You are going to be fun parents.🙏
❤ I’m 13 weeks and my BF and I are through the roof. Excited. It’s been a long 13 weeks. I have the toughest time keeping any food down! I’ll throw up everything unless it’s sour. Grapefruit and tomatoes, and a lot of anti-nausea meds safe for the baby is keeping me alive right now. As a type 1 diabetic I’m constantly afraid that I’m not getting enough nutrients in me.  watching the video and Eamon said you can’t blame everything on pregnancy brain, you can. This morning, I couldn’t remember the name paste for toothpaste. Lol 😅 I kept calling it the tube thing you clean your teeth with. 😊😅
Oh I hope your not moving to Toronto permanently? You have a dream location for bringing up children.  Personally I just don’t think the cities are what they used to be
Oso TOTALLY side eyed the camera....😂😂 Dogs don't have sweet taste buds. They're carnivores so I guess no need for sweets.... I think a higher power is in control -ish, sometimes it MIGHT SEEM LIKE THE WORST TIME FOR SOMETHING..... Come to find out it was EXACTLY THE RIGHT TIME....
What, you are moving to   Tronto? I didn't know that. But I love the cabin. 😢  It's your family home. Well, if you have to move, I guess I'm going with you. You guys are the best. My Jack of all trades and my Judy of some trades.
Very happy for you two 🎉🎉🎉
It's great that your pelvis/hips are already starting to spread for baby girls passage. For some reason mine didn't with my first until I was in active labor. Which basically felt like constant contractions, not front or back labor either, pick a side, nope we're going to do both and all over and it will be constant. My second was so much easier as my pelvis was already ready, I could rest between contractions, labor much shorter.  With my second I also really enjoyed being pregnant, once the all day sickness ended. Knowing he was as close, safe, perfectly cared for and content in my womb was such a wonderful feeling. Every kick, movement, hiccup and poke was cherished and amazing. I knew I'd see him and hold him in my arms soon enough, but the time I would carry him within me would end eventually. With my first all I could focus on was her birth, seeing her and holding her in my arms. Not that the kicks, pushes and movements weren't cherished and amazing, they were. I just didn't stay in the now, this moment, this experience and the miracle that I was already having. Sending love and prayers. God bless.
Aemon how is your guns situation. You are isolated, gotta protect your wonderful family, love y'all
2x Kids. Women are amasing
Don't forget to oil your sides Bec.  It's the only bit I forgot and where I got stretch Marks!
Magnesium helps with leg cramps ❤
Move to Toronto??? Did I miss something???
Your simply beautiful Bec so happy for you and Eamon.
When the belly itches- NEVER scratch it! It’ll cause stretch marks!  Getting stretch marks are hereditary anyway, some ppl won’t get them & others will. B But don’t scratch!
Such a sweet video 💚 Bodies are so strong and your mind also beautiful Bec ✨️
Moving to Toronto? How have I missed this 😂 I just presumed you were staying put due to all the renovations xx
So beautiful. ❤
your moving  back to the six??? why on earth would you leave the lake, if this is only temp after the little bundle arrives ,well that i understand. but don't give up the lake....unless their is massive profit involved, love you guys, will follow no matter what😀😀
17 weeks also with a baby girl!! We’re naming her Norah🥰
Stepping stones look great 👍🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺
Honey! Hahaha. You’re gonna call your baby girl that sometimes too!
I’m not sure if this will help for pregnancy pains, but doesn’t hurt to try. A lot of People don’t realize how things are connected. Trust me, I thought they were crazy. But try putting your leg up on a chair and then bending down to stretch your inner thigh. When you start feeling the pain of it stretching, you’re doing it right. The more relaxed you can keep those, the less low back pain you will have. When they get tight, it pulls on our lower back causing pain. It’s weird. You would never think stretching the muscles to our inner thighs would help our lower back but it 💯 does.
I have a Chesapeake who eats rocks. He will throw up literal piles of rocks. He had surgery two summers ago because one was stuck in his intestines. I’m now the proud owner of a $2000 piece of granite lol.
Hi, Bec and Eamon.  Bec, I love your baby bump❤️  I had 4 babies and I loved each pregnancies.   The new path looks great… well done❤️❤️
Love this video. Love your journey. My kids are 10 and 7 and I miss the newborn phase, and feeling them kick. Enjoy every second
Hi Bec 👋🏻❤️ watching from Paris! You guys are always a bright spot in my day ☀️ I don't have children yet but these vids are making me so excited for that next chapter in my life
I'm currently almost 35 weeks pregnant  with a baby girl as well.  Getting induced at 37 weeks. So happy for yall.  You guys are gonna rock parenthood.
❤ from regina, Saskatchewan
A lot of people say the husband is going to be gaining weight with their wife because his body is also becoming prepared for the long sleepless nights with baby. I have you guys been baby proofing your house or nesting or bringing Oso around little kids sometimes with high energy dogs, it’s good to have a fake baby and play crying noises to let the dog get used to the sounds.
Congratulations  We wish you guys the best always  Things are gonna get thought but don’t give up. Eamon keep doing what your doing. She will go through the motions and try to be there as much as you but sometimes it’s not your fault. Us  women are just going through it physically and mentally
I was thinking fake turf would be better because of the snow! 🫠
I can give you a tip I myself recieved too late. Your ribbons will get soft during pregnancy expanding to give room for the baby. After birth you should put a corset on getting them back to it´s original shape when they are still soft. Otherwise they will get fixed into their new shape. Mine are still sticking up. It doesn´t bother me now I´m 59, but then I remember being quite shocked about my new body. Yeah. Bless you wonderful people good luck and thank you for all the positive vibes you give us! You are both so inspiring! (my english is not perrrrfect) greetings from stockholm
Years ago our poodle used to eat rocks....my father who worked in the medical field gave him liquid paraff🎉in for his stomach problems.  Cured him.  Have Oso checked by a vet...can be serious
You’re going to need more than 20!
I have to say, you guys are a beautiful couple!  It seems your pregnancy is coming along very well! I can't wait to see her when she's born. Unfortunately for me, I didn't have any kids because of severe physical, mental, and emotional abuse by my mother and her husband. And my emotional IQ & emotional conditioning became very screwed up. It's been better for me in my later years since they're dead now and I can move on, but there's only one thing.... I can't have kids now because of my own breast cancer battle from  2011 to around 2013. I've already been through menopause and I'm too old now.  I'm overjoyed for you guys and my heart sings  and dances for you!! Thank you for sharing your lives with us! 🫄🎼🎶🎵💃🏼💞🥹😄🌷🌷🌷🌷🌷🌷🌷🌷🌷
Bec please avoid soy based products! They’re not good for you especially not good if you’ve had breast cancer
Love seeing you guys and all your projects. I am in love with that dog! Can’t wait to meet baby girl!
Oso maybe missing some calcium. Our dog used to eat rocks a lot on our walks like if they were treasure 😂  you can even give him some feta cheese as treats instead of calcium supplement if you want 😊❤ but always check with your vet of course!
Loving the nesting 😊
You would love the creeping thyme look. I’ve seen a few comments on it - hope it’s an option for you! It goes QUICK.
Dragonfly believer!
❤❤❤
Instead of grass between the stones which will need constant maintenance...try a ground cover that spreads between the path...Creeping thyme for example.   No maintenance...tolerates drought and when you walk on it the perfume is lovely.
If you're in a zone where it will grow, thyme is great between stones in a path.
I've been following along with you for years, I'm not sure if I've ever commented or not but I just wanted to say I'm going through a really difficult time in life right now but I always find myself permanently smiling through your videos. 😊 You guys exude joy, peace and love. Thank you for sharing it. 💞 Love you guys!
I’m 14 weeks this coming Tuesday! Cannot waitttt to find out the gender in a little over a month😍
Pelvic floor pain is awful. With my last one I had that not to mention breast leakage so buy some breast pads to put in you bra.  During your last month, baby will drop down in your pelvis so you'll carry her much lower. Her kicking will lessen too. I freaked out about that but it's normal. During labor she won't move at all. You two need to start practicing for the birth...breathing during contractions. Love you two.
I didnt know yoy were moving to Toronto. Does this mean youll have your baby in Toronto?
Beck, you look beautiful!
Wow congrats to all.
Why would you move to TO when you live in gods country😊
Move to Toronto? Are you guys moving to be closer to family? 20:24
Hi! Been watching you guys for a few years from central Alberta! I just went through ovarian cancer & chemo last year. But am now well & thriving! All the best for the rest of your pregnancy!
Yes my dog 'chews' on rocks too haha, and i've heard from others too!
I had my last baby 6 years ago but I still love watching pregnancy journeys. I have 3 and my favorite part was feeling them move inside me but not the hiccups lol. I've heard everyone has that moment where everything becomes real and it hits you. Sometimes it's hearing the heartbeat or seeing the ultrasound. Mine was hearing each of them cry for the first time especially my first. Hit me like a ton of bricks and I bawled each time. I would love to hear what that moment is for you guys. Thank you for sharing your wonderful journey and you guys are amazing in so many ways ❤️
It doesn’t even seem like it’s been 6 months!! I’m so happy for you guys
I’m confused. Move to Toronto ? Did I miss something ?
Sorry Eamon, but you can totally use pregnancy brain for everything. I speak from experience hahaha
Oh man! The calf cramping! I had that so badly when I was pregnant with my little girl. It would wake me up multiple times a week! ❤
Well. I found out I am pregnant 1 day before your announcement video 😅 now I am 18 weeks. I started to show ridiculously early because I get bloated really easily in general. So on week 8 I was not fitting my high weist jeans already. Also now I have an internal stop button when I am tired. If I don't get in bed when I start to get tired, then in half an hour I am tired to the point that I am sick, so even if I wanted I can't push myself. So yeah it was nice following your updates since they are a few weeks ahead of me 😊
Bec, when I had my baby there was something on the market called Mother’s Friend which my mother told me to use for the stretch marks.  I’m pretty sure I’m telling my age by mentioning this, but it worked pretty well.  Unfortunately, you may see those stretch marks in the future.  It’s not from gaining and losing weight, it’s just a natural occurrence.  I guess the body remembers…..lol
Path looking great. Love ❤
❤
❤️❤️👣🐾💐
SOY TIP! When pregnant, it's good for baby to avoid estrogen-esque foods. Especiaply in boys.
Yeah, our dog sits in the back too. We put a little dog bed back there and she loves it. Watch out for your back Bec!!! Pregnancy induces stretchy ligaments!! Yep, I remember the calf cramps at the end of my pregnancies.
My mom comes to me as a buttefly. They find ways to show up and let you know they're still with us.
Just as I was blissfully lost in my thoughts of how this whole episode was like a beautiful breath of fresh air to the soul, the deer starts peeing and Eamons sucking the straw dry. 🤣🤣🩵
Great video guys! Last couple of years has flown by!  Bec is looking really well. You guys gonna be great parents! 👍🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🇬🇧
Hello, I heard a cute name the other day,  Donovan, ??
You didn’t need to move the gravel. You could have laid the pavers in the gravel and have avoided the muddy mess and adding sand.
Love you guys..you have an amazing eye for detail and so full of positivity, your gonna make the best parents ❤🇬🇧
REALLY loved the swim together part.
Hej Bec! I hope I don’t sound rude. I can see you use bio oil for your body. Need to say that that oil have Hormon disturbing things in it ❤ please use something else ❤❤❤
Hi Bec, it’s so crazy because I am currently going through my first pregnancy journey and it was such a coincidence when I saw your announcement!! I am 5 months and also having a girl! Feeling much better now the first 3 months were tough but yes waking up a lot through the night 😂 can’t wait to meet her just need to think of her name I would love some suggestions if anyone has any ideas🥰
not me bursting into laughs in the library with that deer transition smh ahahah
I know you're not perfect. But I love the way you communicate together.  And the way Eamon holds Bec in high regard and praises her. That is success making for your relationship.  You're kids are going to love the way you're firm, but loving with them.
Try magnesium for calf cramps
I can’t believe you have a breast cancer survivor in your house and you’re still eating plant based estrogen: tofu. Stop.
Hi Eamon, Bec and Moso. It's so refreshing to hear from you guys how the Youtube community has been so supportive  of you. You never take anything for granted. That's why we love you guys. As a community we go through our own personal struggles as you do. Bec, to go through an illness and a pregnancy or for that matter any woman is a hero in my book. And Eamon, to be there when Bec needs you is what makes it more satisfying.  That's why we continue to follow you on this journey. ❤ Thank you, that we're a part of this community. Sending you love and prayers ❤❤  Jim, Harriet and Yuki. Richmond, Va.
Bec your such a beautiful soul❤❤❤ I can’t wait to see baby girl and watch your little family enjoy this journey ❤❤❤
Check the vet first, mine said no honey but pure maple syrup is ok, a tiny amount of honey is ok   But vets each have their ideas for different sizes and breeds❤ You are looking so cute with that little baby bump🥰  Mr.E, get yourself a “ cargo” net for the back back and Oso
Grass constantly grows up over my walkway stones. I'm yelling at you in my head "use weed block!" and "keep the stones in between!"... and I'll be watching to see how you keep the grass from covering them. I've lifted mine and reset them and a year later the grass covered them again. Maybe I have the wrong type grass for the manicured look. 🍿
Reheating rice isn't the best idea esp for Bec. NEVER EVER MICROWAVE LEFTOVER RICE!!! It won't heat evenly.  The longer cooked rice is left at room temperature, the more likely it is that the bacteria or toxins could make the rice unsafe to eat.  Symptoms of food poisoning If you eat rice that contains Bacillus cereus bacteria, you may be sick and experience vomiting or diarrhoea about 1 to 5 hours afterwards. Symptoms are relatively mild and usually last about 24 hours.  Tips on serving rice safely Ideally, serve rice as soon as it has been cooked. If that is not possible, cool the rice as quickly as possible (ideally within 1 hour). Keep rice in the fridge for no more than 1 day until reheating. When you reheat rice, always check that it's steaming hot all the way through. Do not reheat rice more than once.
An idea for getting Oso comfortable sitting in the back. Strap in a box that’s about the size of a baby carrier into your backseat. He may as well get used to having something actually in the backseat, rather than seeing it empty, which means to him, he should be able to sit there.  Continued blessings on a healthy pregnancy.
Thank you so much for sharing your journey with us. ❤❤❤ you have brought more joy to my life in the last few years. This month marks 6 years without my grandmother. The person that raised me.
Your baby bump is so cute! I’m so excited to see you guys become parents
So cool to have a man so handy and cooks too 🤗
I’m 25 and a half weeks pregnant with my first! It’s been tough feeling ill a lot and I totally empathise about the sober weddings. I can relate so much to your journey, i appreciate your videos and wish you all the best with the rest of your pregnancy ❤️
Calf cramping is the worst! But it’s mostly because of dehydration! There’s SO much more blood pumping through your body that you need more water to compensate.   Also, yoga stretches like cat calf and child’s pose really helps the hips and joints 🩷❤️
so proud of you guys 🥹
You’re moving to Toronto?! ☺️
It’s very expensive and dangerous to remove rocks from doggies belly, I know.  Give him a toy to carry everywhere. You will be glad you did
Lots of love from Germany 💚 i've discovered your channel only a couple of weeks ago but i haven't watched anything else on Youtube since then, wish you only the best 🤗
1) you are moving to Toronto? And 2) Does your cousin work for Alexandra Grater?
You can go in a hottub. You just have to get out when you start sweating. It takes a lil while for your body temp to go up so you're fine in there for a lil bit to warm up after a swim then you can sit on the side and dangle your feet in longer. They recommend 10 min or less for first trimester, but after that you're fine in there as long as you aren't overheating. Keep the spa at 98 degrees or less to be safe.The hot tub will actually be good for you as it will relax your expanding muscles and ease the aches a bit. You can always take your temp while in there to make sure it's not going up above 99.
Can you let us know oso's story? I love ❤️ him.
Water is life and the key. Keep yourself hydrated, girl. You look beautiful, im so excited for you guys and your next chapter. You will never love anyone as much as your babie(s)❤
I think it's great that you talk about the not-so-glowing parts of pregnancy.  I was so surprised by them, because nobody ever talks about them.  The constipation, sciatic pain, aching hips, and the sheer exhaustion in the 3 trimester. But it's all worth it for the beautiful baby you get in the end ❤
Great video, really enjoyed it 😘
If you're a good man, it is hard. To protect and fully provide for your family is a hard job. To be emotionally stable to act as a support for a woman is hard. Good men are very under appreciated. We as women need to appreciate men more and allow them to lead and provide. So many men don't do this anymore because too many women shame them for wanting to do that. And these are the same women who complain that there are "no good men out there."
Did you know that you're also carrying the eggs for your granddaughter? Your baby girl will be born with all of her eggs. 2 generations now growing in your uterus!
I'm 3 months pregnant with our 4th baby 😍🤰 loving following along with you guys. Big love to you all xxxx
dont know what its like having a child cause i had twins first time it was great then again being grandpa is a blast just dont blink to much
I think it's a shepherd thing. My German always has a rock in her mouth. I have quite a few in the house she just couldn't live without! Lol gotta love them
Love this. You guys have changed SO much (and not at all I suppose) and it’s rad to witness. Love that Lee made a cameo 😇 I wonder where you’ll settle in TO?!?
Hi there. I am on 36 week of my 4 pregnancy but 2 nd child. Very happy and blessed. And happy to see u bump growing and u being happy. 🎉 ❤❤what a jorney !
Hi!!! From Saint Cloud, Fl...❤
Move to Toronto!? What did I miss?
Have u decided to breast feed or bottle? And name yet?
This video is full of fun and a sense of humor as usual.  I love all the joking around. Your new walkway is similar to what we've done here.  The stones are so heavy and only cover a small area so I felt big empathy for you Eamon.  My son John and I worked in the hot summer sun loading them from a stone yard and etc etc.  Bec you seem healthy and I hope you and your baby continue to do well.  Good exercise and good food too.
I read that tatoo as Real Foxi!
Hi guys watching from London ontario canada i love watching your videos , i  have unfortantly only been pregnant once and it ended in a misscarrage but i am ok with not having biological children thank you for all the fun videos
U r so cute pregnant! Am on looks excited too.
I just love watching you guys! 💕🌸
You guys are the best!😘
Aww Bec I’m just so proud of you and Eamon, you have been so resilient, strong probably when you thought you could not get through fighting cancer. And look at you now. Bec you are glowing, love watching you on this journey. I live in New Zealand and I am also a breast cancer survivor 5 yrs next March.💕🎀
9 month postpartum. I forgot all about the hip and calf pain during pregnancy, especially at night. Also the sacrifices of a mother continue on postpartum…I know it makes sense but I never realized the gravity of it. It’s wonderful that Eamon is supportive and appreciative.
Has Eamon dyed his bangs silver / grey ( fringe in my country) … or is it the lighting…?
I'm currently 5 months postpartum, and watching you go through this pregnancy is so nostalgic! I will say the first 2 months were so rough with our little guy since he had a tongue and lip tie we had to fix & sleep deprivation and exclusive pumping was HARD. My husband and i have never been closer but also have never argued more in our lives. Learning to meet your needs, communicate your needs, and keep a human alive can be A LOT. Know that postpartum isnt always sunshine and rainbows, but everything is a season with some seasons better than others. Our son has been such a joy and has been SO fun lately, he has his own personality, loves to laugh, and has started army crawling all over the house. Its so cool to watch this person grow into their own, and im sure youll love experiencing it with baby girl! I cant wait to see your journey into parenthood. Sidenote - a pregnancy pillow between my knees and supporting my back helped LOADS with the hip pain!  Edit to say I totally hated that my mom said honey ALL the time & now I call my son "honey" / "sweet honey baby". Maybe it happens after you turn 30 & have a kiddo! Lol
I love watching you both! Been watching you for years and you are inspiring couple!!!!!!! Congratulations and the baby girl all the way from pei ❤
I think it is pretty common for dogs to eat rocks, when I had my buds they would do it all the time, so much so that rocks were used to fetch instead of sticks.
Bec has post chemo brain and pregnancy brain…so yes, she can blame that on everything 😂💕 I’ve had chemo and given birth twice, it does mess with your head haha
You're selling the cabin and moving to Toronto?
You look absolutely radiant! Im 11 months post partum, i had undiagnosed pre eclampsia and had to have an emergency C section at 35 weeks. My Little Boy is happy and healthy and growing like a weed!  I hate an anterior placenta as well, so i didnt get to feel his kicks until later in the pregnancy, but they are the most amazing thing!
Yes, Karr used to eat rocks but I made him stop. They don’t come out in poop as far as I know. I Grabbed a cage muzzle and rocks no for be Karr. Tools like muzzles are good for learning.  The length of time in learning, is all dependent on him.  The patio rocks I would have staggered for walking. Just so every step has sure footing. This way you don’t have to make sure you are stepping on a rock you just are stepping on a rock. I know you have are ready finished, but it’s just a subjection. Twisted ankles are not fun.  ❤️🇨🇦
Love from Burlington, Ontario. You make my sunday every week!!
Awesome 😊👍
Your moving?? 😱 Why?
Excellent edit you guys...
Congratulations 🎉❤ God bless you both. This is incredible news
My sister hit 27 weeks, developed pre-eclampsia and had to have my niece early. They are actually still in the hospital.  Looks like they won't be making it home til after Thanksgiving. 💔
Love you guys so much your channel is amazing and back, you are a hero in your own form, you and Amen make love and life more beautiful for many others to see you bring joy to everybody that watches your channel, congrat some baby girl and can't wait to see your beautiful family continue to grow, send in. You guy's love and hugs.❤❤❤❤
Calf cramps!!  I've got you!!! To release a charley horse, grab your toes and pull toward your knee. I had such bad ones when I was pregnant, that I couldn't move and my husband had to do it for me,  I would be frozen and yelling at him, in the middle of the night, to "pull my toes up!! " but it really works!
I feel like I'm getting a niece.  Love you guys. ❤  You too Osso ❤❤
Where and when are you going to Toronto?  To be close to a hospital?  You guys are doing awesome!!!
Currently 29 weeks with baby number 2. This is my 5th pregnancy, so I’ve had 3 miscarriages. It’s been a lot, but so grateful that I get to experience this again. In the space of 3.5 years my body has gone through 5 pregnancies and will be 2 births. It’s incredible. Really looking forward to meeting baby girl and to watch my two children bond and grown together. I never had a sister so I’m really happy that I get to witness this special bond.  Loving following your journey!! And you are amazing Bec! ❤❤❤❤
Hey you guys Do you still own the property in Mexico or was that a rental? Also your seating/storage in the new bedroom,…,,,,,, where did you get that from?
Did you know a man's DNA has the potential to change yours while pregnant. So it is very possible you are turning into Eamon a little. At least that's what I've heard
Production seems to have been leveled up!! wonder if they got a new editor but it’s really great!!! Good job:)
Just saw your Instagram after the video ☺️am watching from Sarnia but have been watching 3 years and I’ve moved around … so have been watching from Paris Ontario and Exeter too 🥰
Bec, you've proven just how strong we women are. You guys should get a baby doll and start holding it so Oso can get used to seeing a baby around. You're probably going to have to get a netting or something like it to keep him from climbing from the back of the car to where the baby will be. Bec, you look so adorable.
2 moths postpartum, enjoying our new life, while watching sweet baby girl grow ❤
Eamon’s cooking skills impress me! Our dog wants to eat rocks too, but we don’t allow her. It’s horrible for their teeth & digestive system.🙁 My calves cramped horribly during all three of my pregnancies. I made sure I drank plenty of water, ate a banana most days, & also drank coconut water. I read that coconut water has more potassium than bananas, so I drank that for a refreshing change. It definitely helped.
You guys are going to be amazing parents ❤️.  Maybe consider switching Oso, to natural home made dog food? You guys eat so well, please consider doing same for Oso!❤🐾🙏
wow i must have missed something you guys are moving to toronto? have yall got a place yet? thats pretty cool.
As a new mother (9mo old) I feel like "I wouldn't trade it for anything, it's just been hard" is pretty much what I feel on a daily basis now.
Is the move to Toronto temporary?   My cravings were Mexican, all and any time.
When dogs eat dirt or rocks, it can be a mineral deficiency. Vital Earth has a supplement for pets. I prefer using liquid vitamins and minerals for my pets.
what happened to moving to mexico?
This makes me so happy :)  My husband and I (yes we are indeed 🤌homosexuals🤌) have just started the process of becoming dads for the first time as we have filled out the forms in order to start our adoption journey!
welcome to the mama world Bec💛
I am watching from Kentucky, USA. You guys are doing an amazing job.
I am so happy for the both of you you!
What on earth! You’re moving to toronto!? 😢
Hi! So great to see how you guys have been! It’s a joy to watch all the videos you post! So happy you will soon have a baby girl in your lives! 🩷
Oh "NO brain or pregnancy fog" IS SOOOOOO  REAL!   Everyone thoughti was a "duh" when I was pregnant!
From now on I shall only refer to Eamon as Big Sweet Guy😂😂❤sending love to you guys, Bec you look amazing!!!!❤
I just love ya'll's fun energy!!!  LOL!!  Oh and FYI bananas are good for calf cramps!!  :)
Hi Bec, I’m currently watching this whilst my 6 week old little girl is sleeping on my chest 🥰  It’s so lovely watching your pregnancy journey just after going through it for myself and just so happy for you both after everything you went through! 💕💕
Also Tonic water for the calf cramping. The quinine in it takes them away. My grandmother taught me that. ♥️🫶♥️
Hey when are ya getting married?????
Magnesium for all the pregnancy things!
I wish more men had the same mindset and insight as Eamon. They are both so lucky. Their relationship is very inspiring 🖤
Y’all are amazing! Sending lots of love and hugs your way. Did I miss something? You mentioned moving to Toronto. Is that just for the birth of baby girl?
How far has one year taken Bec and so good to see all is going as planned.  Wondering what the move will bring, it such an awesome looking place in the woods, I would never leave.   That new path without mesh will be covered in weeds all too soon, good luck.
You should name your baby after Lee in memory of your best friend!!!
Absolutely over the 🌙 that you are 6 months with baby.  Your cabin is gorgeous.  Eamon is an brill chef - so lucky.  A little girl is the best of both worlds..Namaste 🙏❤️🌾🌴🌙
Bec, you are one of the most amazing women I have ever seen. ❤️
Yup, you need moore stone.....  Bec, with you not a fan of cilantro.
Love ur videos im from uk   be doing house work all day and trying to work out  what videos to start doing to build my youtube  and thats been the most stressful  today lol have a wonderful day and bec u looking beautiful
❤❤❤❤❤
Love you both so very much ❤❤ #speakupforlee
Grass? Creeping thyme instead. No mow or weed whacker 👍
The grass is good but things like creeping thyme can look really good between paving stones, has less weeds, and is very soft!
I wait all week for Sunday to watch you two. I love the journey you are in and have been on. You both are such beautiful people❤
Love watching your journey ❤️
Bec, with everything you’ve gone through, I’m so glad you get to experience the joy of motherhood.  Congrats to you and Eamon!
Bec, you're a beautiful pregnant woman......  So love that the belly has really started to pop.  You and Eamon are the most adorable couple......  As for Oso eating rock, not good.  My uncle had an Irish Setter that died from it.  I'd ck with your vet, he might be low on some type of mineral or vitamin.  Just a thought... ❤❤❤❤
When are you changing your logo to say "Eamon, Bec + Baby🪇"
This was great. ❤
Moving to Toronto? I'm pretty sure I watch all of your videos, did I miss something?
Love that you guys just get projects done!! Need to get my husband to watch more so he can get inspired 😂 Bec, you're totally helpful! Everyone needs a cheerleader! Was that whittakers chocolate that Eamon held up?! Much love from NZ
Y’all need a good boy counter on every video lol
When you gave Oso a treat, he literally ate your whole hand with it 😮😂 5:55
Not currently pregnant or will have any more babies. I have 3 kiddos, 2 boys and a girl. Pregnancy is bonkers! I am impressed that Bec is up and helping so much at 6mnths. Get it, Mama! We support and love you 3 (4)❤❤
So weird, my dog hates the camera too! lol literally turns off her cuteness when it comes out hahaha
For me it was "darling".  Now everyone is *_darling_*  my daughter, my partner, the cat, the dog - it's all _darling_ all day.
I love you both so very much considering we don’t know, know each other. I’ve been holding back on comments because I realize you can’t possibly all of them. Plus everyone has opinions and not necessarily all opinions are useful to you. That said, from the theme of you video I am strongly pulled to add my opinion in the  intention of helping. In case it is not in your bank of knowledge or it is and you’ve forgotten. Disease only thrives in a acidic environment. So if you chose to only consume alkaline foods or at the very least incorporate them as much as possible it would help your body become stronger and little Bec&Emmon have the healthiest start she could possibly be given.  Much Aloha Nui Loa🌺
I’m 29 weeks pregnant and super tired
May God gives You Alot Alot Happiness from Your Child And gives your baby Girl Healthy Happy Life Amen❤️❤️
My best friends mom who was like my mom passed away a couple of years ago suddenly. We both text each other whenever we see a dragonfly and say it's her coming to visit. <3
I Was hoping you'd continue your deck between the two places instead of the stones. Still pretty initially.  I missed something you're moving oh no I love you little country Retreat hope you're keeping That
This is such a feel good episode. Thank you love you guys! ❤
Now I can't get the vision, nor the sound, out of my head of the deer squatting with Eamon blowing into his drink with a straw.  Thank you for that!  Cute video, it was fun.  Moving to Toronto?  What?
No, don't move to Toronto.  Don't move to a city. Raise your baby in the country.  Your place is a great place to raise a family.
When the calf cramp hits, pull your toes up toward your knee as fast as possible and it will stop the cramping.  Also, you can get a magnesium spray and put that on your legs and calves before sleeping.   You’re doing amazing, Bec ❤
Quote of the day!  “You don’t need to be pretty to work. Look at me”  -Guy at the Home store 😂
What a lucky baby girl! Also whatever happened to your plans to purchase in Mexico? Is that still in the plans?
Nick and I have been watching you both grown for years now. Pretty special to share your lives so openly with all of us. You give me inspiration to do projects I never thought I was capable of. Thank you. We’re watching from Goodlettsville Tennessee!!
Moving to Toronto? Why? How? When?😮❤
I can’t wait to see baby girl 👶🏼💖 She’ll be the best project y’all have ever done together but I love watching all of your other projects. Y’all make me feel useless dumb and lazy. Isn’t it funny how pets know a baby is coming? They want to be right up with you so much more and they get super protective and excited. Crazy what a roller coaster life can be. From our scariest lows to our highest highs sometimes within in a day. As always I’m sending love and prayers and wishing you the very best.
Omg the pelvic floor pain at the end killed me.🙈🙈
I call my boys "Troub😢le" even now, they are 35 & 37 lol The other day I called my grandson something like cutie for a joke and he said "nope I'm your Trouble!" Trouble 1, 2, & 3!
When you guys take on a project I get so excited cause I know it's gonna turn out amazing!!  Looking good Bec wow, 6 months pregnant!
What happened to the dog shelter in Mexico??? Any updates???
You should get your lower back with oil too, esp. if your hips are expanding.
We have our girl Lola and she is a mix breed, she always ate rocks and she also would dig up broken glass and eat it. We lived by the beach so glass was buried everywhere. I always worried she wouldn't pass and surgery would be in the future. She is now 7 and doesn't do it anymore but she seeks stuff in the house now. Looking for trouble and wanting treats lol. Anyways, my son is 14 now and awesome. He was born at 29 weeks 2lbs 15.5 oz. I cant believe how fast the time went and wish I knew and enjoyed so much more. Don't blink is the truest statement. You are both amazing!! Love following your incredible journey!!!❤
Oso is going to be such a good big brother <3  Pregnancy IS hard on our body...and it changes some things...I believe we take a hit physically when we carry, sustain and then birth babies.  It's such a completely mind blowing otherworldly experience and I'd never trade it either, but it's no joke the toll it takes.  It's why we were made to be so tough and resilient.  ;)
Move to Toronto?? Did i miss this cause i dont remember hearing about it. You are looking wonderful Bec and so is Eamon.  See you soon🤗🫶
It’s not “complainey” it’s reality. More women should be transparent about the toll that pregnancy actually takes on your body.
Makes me so nervous to see Oslo running around when you’re driving your truck and other things…  I don’t want him to get hurt 😢
Love your story. -x-
After seeing what you both have gone through this is beautiful ❤
I’m 13 weeks + 3 😊
Hai Guys! I'm still in my first trimester but have loved every minute of my couple months pregnant! Taking all the symptoms as they come! So excited for you! 🤍
Been watching you guys since day 1 and can honestly say you are the most genuine and amazing couple ever! So inspiring and you’ve got me though some really dark days! So happy to see your little baby girl join your family! 🩷 xx
Thankyou for sharing and reminding us of the resiliency of ourselves/ our bodies Bec!! Wishing you the good health, joy and fun for the remainder of the pregnancy and take care!!
I know you guys think just because something is plant based it’s healthy. It’s not. You should not be drinking soy or oat milk. Try coconut milk instead. No cashews or peanuts either.
Very very happy for you two! Even if its ging to be a big Transformation having a baby is the most beautiful present in life! Sending best wishes from switzerland and our 4month old Baby Girl 🩷
Wait yall are moving? I must have missed where that was mentioned. What about this place? I love seeing these vids and all that you do here!
Bec what is this about Toronto?
I love you guys!!! I’ve been watching your channel for a long long time! And I’m so excited about the current season you guys are in!!! The new path project looks sick! Blessings on blessings! ❤❤
Happy Sunday, Love the new pathway and so love the journey on meeting baby girl!  Sending 💜 !
Moving to Toronto?  Leaving this beautiful spot?  Please explain……..
22 weeks on wednesday🥰 feeling okay, but surely feeling the fatigue😅 having a baby girl💕 sending all the love from nothern/mid norway!❤️❤️
Beck you looks beautiful! I can’t wait to see baby girl. Blessings to you and the family!
It was better if you mixed the dirt ahead of time wit the grass seed in the shovel attachment of the tractor then laid the dirt..the grass would be more lush and thick and it grows faster because it's kept moist under the dirt instead of on top...,..😊
For a second there, it looked like we could see how you got baby girl 😅 3.27 for reference
I must of missed the  “Moving to Toronto “ memo.   Is it as the cabin is just not winter friendly?
Will you be back next summer to the property?
Bec, you're looking so healthy. Pregnancy is hard for so many women. Trust me when I say, the second you give birth  all of those pains disappear instantly, like a miracle lol Soon enough, you will be us and running around, albeit - sleep deprived hahah  Anyway, I have been on the Eamon and Bec train for a long time now (years) and I just want to say how proud I am of your example of what it means to be a good human being. Happy we landed on this plane of existence at the same time.   Maika mamook naika tumtum kloshe!   Taumy
How crazy is it, that I'm IN LOVE with a dog that I have never and will never see in real life? Oso is so adorable, I wait for your vlogs to see him and the pair of you equaly. Ok, maybe a tiny bit more for him... How about an additional chanel: The Adventures of Oso Bear? I know your days will shrink soon and you wouldn't have to post every week, just from time to time. I'm sure I'm not the only person who would love that.
Bec! Are you sure Eamon doesn't do some of the editing? You know...the DEER thing, around 25 minutes? I thought you were the sweet one and Eamon added those parts 😂😂😂😂
Watched this video while breastfeeding my two month old baby girl! Can’t wait for you to experience motherhood Bec! Eamon you seem to already know and appreciate all that Bec is going through, she’ll be lucky to have you once baby girl is here! Also Oso makes me smile! Watching from St.Tomas,ON 😊
So glad your back every Sunday!
I am not on the same journey but I appreciate all the openness, honesty, and strength.  Bec is an inspiration to all and a comfort to those that have had cancer infiltrate their lives.
Just has my first baby two months ago, she’s a sweet little baby girl and it’s an absolute dream. It’s so hard but I want to do it ten more times. The connection you feel to your babe is real, keep  talking to her. I even started an email for her and sent her notes while I was pregnant. ❤
Wow Bec - you've properly popped out now. Looking so good.
Hi Lee :)
Watching from BC, Canada currently! But I have been following you for years. I first met you in Muskoka at a Yoga Festival where I fell in love with your chai. Then found you on YouTube when I discovered Van Life. I also think I use to work in the Bridal store next to a pub Lee worked at in Barrie (my hometown). Small world! I’ve watched weekly for at least 5 years and I look forward to your videos every week - you are both incredible humans and I am so glad you let us all in on your adventures, introduce us to your friends, and make us all feel that maybe we have what it take to overcome any challenges that come our way too. Big love to you ❤
Well done both but particularly Bec!
Hey Bec, I’m currently 23+5 days pregnant and it’s baby number 3 our second daughter. I’ve loved watching your journey and I can’t wait for your journey through motherhood ❤ both of you will be amazing parents ❤
Wow. Because you actually look really pregnant now. So lovely to see you. Take care in what you do. Not too much building work now. Milady shouldn't be doing much. I love that Oso just watched you dive in the water.
So happy for you! 💕 🦮Just a question, I think I seen all of your videos in the las 3-4 years but I never understood how Oso came to your family. To me, he just started appearing in 2020. But there must be a story behind, did I miss it?🦮
Sleep while you can!🙏🥰
Did you say you’re moving to toronto?
Moving to Toronto?? Did I hear that right?
Hi. Have you seen a clip of the couple who have put ear phones in their dogs ears to hear the babi❤es heartbeat.  It’s so cute.  Bec you look amazing by 😂the way. Sending love to you both ♥️♥️♥️
I have a question! I got told not to get pregnant for 5 years after I finished chemo. Where you advised differently? Thanks! And so excited for your journey to come!
U guys r so beautiful.  So proud of u guys.  So excited for all 3 or u. Oso bn the 3rd.    The lopsided boobie from Ur surgery is the cutest part. It's like it's becoming a major part or Ur prego and I love it all the more.   Even Ur back deck changes colour with the shadows and the season.  Lime u guys change with season.❤
For those worried that this will be a baby channel now, there will always be projects to work on because of Eamon!
The water is so nice and clean. Please buy Oso a life jacket so he can comfortably swim with you guys lol. Every time I watch him watching the both of you, I wish he could experience it with you as a family❤❤❤
Bec, take a potassium supplement at night and your leg cramps should resolve.
When did you say you’re moving to Toronto? Did I miss that part? 20:23
In my opinion E&B are the most deserving couple on YouTube ! Prayers for a happy, healthy birth ! ❤❤❤
Does Ozo get anything else than that hard dog 'food'? Im sure he would appreciate some real food too😍
Love Sunday mornings with you both. So excited about this next journey. Been watching for over 4 years. ❤❤
I wasn’t into sweets until I got pregnant and had a kid. I still love sweets and my kid doesn’t!
Have you ever considered doing a DNA test on Oso? He reminds me of my Cane Corso, and all of his hilarious behaviors. Would love to know if he has any of the breed in him. 😂 Also, the first video you posted finding out you were pregnant I had just went into Labor a couple days earlier and of course I was in tears of excitement and also joy of how much you’re going to love your new little human like I do. ❤️❤️❤️
Happy Sunday! I can't watch a video from you without having a strong emotional response. You always thank us for being a part of your journey but I feel so much gratitude that you have included us in your journey. I found you during the Pandemic and during lockdown a video from you two was one of the highlights or my week. I have had so many life changes as well and seeing you come through flourishing is so encouraging!
One of my favorite videos! Love the love💜
So 18 years ago i was 26 and a half weeks pregnant amd that is when i found out about her!
Moving to Toronto? When did I miss that update?
Ask your Dr.  About vitamins and body mass
I remember the calf cramps at night with my first.  It was terrible! Sadly didn't stop until I gave birth :) They say banana can help but two a day was not enough for me
You both are such beautiful people. Thank you for sharing your life story with us. So excited for baby girls arrival. 🥰💕
FYI The oil is great on your belly. I just applied oil on my belly. I have no stretch marks on my belly. No one told me to apply oil to my upper legs, back and but. I know have worse stretch marks are on my upper legs, back and butt chechs. I hope the advice helps. Ya'll are wonderful couple!! I enjoy watching your adventures!!👍✌❤🙏
I would’ve been 14weeks on Tuesday, but god had other plans for me unfortunately and miscarried a week ago. Watching your videos have helped so much, I’ve just been rewatching your Mexico ones xxx
I caught a bad cold so I was feeling a bit down, luckily Oso always makes me laugh and that's wonderful! you are going to be a beautiful family ❤
Have you been watching The Bear? The way you were yelling out chef cracked me up!
Your hair looks so cute down and curly!!! You can tell pregnancy is doing something special to it!! Always beautiful though ;) you are the inspiration!
I must have missed something, are you moving to Toronto temporarily for the babies birth or is this a permanent move? Your cabin is such a beautiful place I can't imagine ever leaving there voluntarily.
So good to see y’all. Love your lives.  😊
I’m 26 weeks due December 27th so on a similar timeline as you guys! So far feeling good also loving feeling our little guy kick and move around, but getting comfortable at night is getting harder and harder! Love seeing your journey and getting to experience pregnancy together as this is also my first!
I love watching you two! You  are such a good team and I love how you work together and everything! Watching from  Oakville Ontario!!
The path looks great 😊😊😊
If your doctor agrees, magnesium was a complete game-changer for me when it came to leg cramps. Went from cramps nearly every night to ZERO within the first weeks. 💗
Your hair is still so short needs to grow out. 6 months and your hair hasn't grown even when your on or should be vitamins
Bec,I’m so proud of you you have done so much and stayed positive during it all so I’m so glad that your cancer free and that you are having a little bec🫶🏻🩷☀️
This video is everything I love about you guys. Thank you so much for sharing yourselves with us. I found your channel just a couple of months ago and have watched nearly every bit of your content since then because you bring so much joy and inspiration. The way you support each other, your positivity, creativity, sense of humor, and so much more is such a pleasure to watch. I’m so happy and excited for you both to experience parenthood in this next chapter of your journey.
Moving to Toronto?
What are you thinking "mat leave" will look like for you?
❤❤❤👏🏽👏🏽💪🏾💪🏾👍👍☕️☕️☕️☕️❤️❤️❤️❤️
my dogs name is Cooper and he is a catahoula leopard dog and he loves rocks and i find a new stash every week when i go to clean. lol Also whenever he is outside and has a rock he thinks its a game with a toy and he will run until we catch him... half the time if its a small rock he tries to eat it but i bribe him with treats to get him to drop it... lol
Enjoy it. It goes so fast
You two are a wonderful couple. This little one is blessed beyond messed. Doing a great job♥️
As someone who is almost the exact same weeks along as you- thank you for making me not feel crazy for wanting to get ALL the house projects done as well 🤣 I’ve been putting my husband and I to WORK!
1987 I was pregnant w my son after 2 miscarriages.  I got cervical cancer.  Sept 1988 I delivered my son my cancer went away, weird, but I got pregnant 2 more times after but miscarriages both each time I got pregnant cancer came back. I had a hysterectomy Jan 1990. Was weird,, scary not sure I was angry,, happy sad.. God works in miracle Bec you have been blessed.. So very happy for you.. You are beautiful.
First off, Bec you look amazing!! So glad things are going well. Enjoy those sweets😉 We love the pathway you guys added, that's going to look so so good when the grass comes in!  We couldn't wait till back home, so we watched from Iceland today!!
Sleep as much as you can NOW.  and oh yes you can blame EVERYTHING and ANYTHING in being pregnant!!   Ty EAMON... for saving the  🐢 ♥
My advice: drink water,( I almost passed out from not drinking enough while pregnant.), don't blink and enjoy even the bad times. (They warp speed by!), and back up your videos and photos on an external hard drive. (I lost the first year of videos and photos of my last child because my computer crashed.).....❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️oh! Sleep when you need it, and when the baby is. I know you will ve tempted to stay awake and look and "study" your newborn. It will zap your energy. (Been there done that). And don't be hard on your self. As new parents, you are learning. This last child is my third. But I am still learning. It's building a relationship with a new human. No matter how young they are. And please enjoy newborn life as it flies by so very fast❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️and I am so happy for you two❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Hello 👋 ❤❤❤
I'm also pregnant, 31 weeks. Having a second baby girl. 👶 this one has been a blessing pregnancy. 🤰🏻 Happy to have my husband for support and my two yr old keeps me moving and health. ❤
Bec you are absolutely ADORABLE!!! With everything you (and Eamon) have been through, to be at this point now is such a tremendous blessing! I'm loving watching you beautiful baby bump grow and can't wait to see your beautiful baby girl! ❤👶🐾❤️
My dad said will put a zipper in Yeller’s belly after the 20th time at the vet to have removed. He was part dachshund and lab. And the dachshund was the dad. He had dad’s legs and face and mom’s body. Was the best friend to my baby sister.
I’m 38 weeks pregnant with number 2! Due any day now! And definitely having those pains. Pelvic pain and lower back pain is terrible. And with my son my hips expanded sooo much I’m 5ft so don’t have much torso and he came out 10lbs 6oz sooo lots of things got bigger.
love ya, guys 😎😎😎😎❤❤❤❤🖖🖖🖖🖖🖖
I appreciate the emoji stance in the thumbnail 😂
For the leg cramps stand barefoot on the cold floor and wash your hands in hot water. For some reason the 2 extremes help relax the muscle.
Beautiful video, as usual ❤
You two could post about poop and I’d watch. I love watching the two of you!!  ❤. And all these domestic videos are so relaxing too.  Thanks for sharing.
This year has gone by so fast!
Yeah it’s not just Oso that eats rocks my cousin dog eat a rock choked on it and die so be careful
I’m 21 weeks pregnant 🤰 with a little girl💕.
CAUTION; if your sweet Oso continues eating rocks, eventually even that big boy is going to ingest either one too big to pass, or will end up with enough in his belly and/or intestines to cause a blockage. Either way, you’ll be looking at emergency surgery.  We can see you’re aware he shouldn’t be eating rocks, but I’d suggest a firm “Drop it”, “no rock!” or direct him away from the rock to the rock-less deck for a gentle time-out (preferably with a more appropriate chew toy available). ❤❤❤ Love to Oso.
1) You guys are ALWAYS a joy to watch :)  2) I love that you don't share everything online. It seems like you have a rich life with family and friends, and you get tattoos without having to document it for everyone on the Internet. It's so wise to keep things for yourselves! You seem to have a healthy balance -- great job 👏 3) My husband and I aren't able to have kids. We are on the waiting list to adopt. While we can't experience the journey of pregnancy, it's been nice to see yours. So glad that you've had a year of blessings after a difficult one! 4) When are y'all moving to Toronto?? What's the plan for the cabin after you move?
Great job with the garden path Eamon & Bec ... thank you for helping Wilfred the turtle off the road ... wonderful vlog ❤️
Congrats! I'm so happy for you both!
I can just see it now. Baby girl will only sleep when you lull her to sleep on..the tractor!
22 weeks with baby girl 🥰 also my first, also went from van-life to a cabin in the woods, also have to build another bedroom, and this pregnancy has been really hard on my body as well. But watching your videos a few weeks ahead in your pregnancy makes everything seem normal
The months have gone fast in this pregnancy Bec and Eamon and Bec you are positively glowing.
Make sure Oso is getting all the minerals he needs in his diet in case that’s why he chews on rocks!
Hi Bec can I please ask what your morning routine was with your skin care, also I love you guys and Eamon makes me chuckle x
We called it placenta brain and Eamon- it’s real!
Are you selling the cabin?
There’s this myth that pregnant women aren’t allowed to complain about the symptoms or pain during pregnancy because they need to be grateful. But the pain is real and can be quite awful. People can be grateful and still have real pain at the same time. It silences women and can make the suffering worse because they “aren’t” allowed to talk about it.

Eamon stand behind bec and hold that pregnant belly up will help bec out alot be gentle tho when lifting her belly ❤
Just watched with our 9 year old twin daughters all the way from North Yorkshire, UK. We all love your videos and look forward to watching them! The girls are particularly excited about you expecting your first baby ans we all wish you well! x
Due February 18th with baby boy #2 😊❤.
Toronto?  What?  Did I miss something?  I had to watch twice to make sure I heard correctly!
Beatyful mamma.💜
When dogs eat rocks it means they are missing some minerals
You and Eamon are amazing people! You both are gonna be great parents! I can't wait to see the next chapter with your baby girl!
Hey Bec, just wondering what that face syrum you were using at the beginning of the episode is? ❤
Soy is not good for baby
Drop that curry recipe! Yum
Not sure when you’re relocating to Toronto, but it would be so incredible to see drone shots of the fall season around your place.  Are you both planning on making GTA your permanent residence & use the cabin as a vacay place? Personally, I couldn’t leave your cabin in the woods for the traffic in Toronto 😱
curious how yall feel about showing/not showing your kid on the internet
TORONTO!!???
Love you guys. Pathway looks great. Excited about baby girl
I’m currently 22 weeks pregnant with a baby boy. My hips hurts a lot. But I love it cause I get to feel him kick. And just know he coming into the world soon.
We just got a puppy a few weeks ago and she also will eat and swallow rocks! I thought it was just her🤣
You are so strong a a beautiful woman and I bet your going to be a wonderful mother ❤❤❤❤ congratulations to you both 🎉
Moving to Toronto??! I don't know how I missed that was happening! Glad you are keeping well, lots of love from Ireland 🇮🇪 ❤
Can you get a dog net. To put at the back of the vehicle to prevent him from getting in the front.
You have a cute belly, Bec. You look wonderful. There are special creams that you can slather on your belly to prevent stretch marks.
Bec. You never glowed so much, looked so beautiful and I am so so happy to be a part of your journey. Oh my gosh, the two of you make my heart fill with love and joy for Everyone, but especially the two of you. Have you registered Baby Girl anywhere yet? Hugs and love you guys so much.
Bec, you are so amazing in every way. You are so strong. I can't wait to see you become a mom and Eamon a dad. I watch every video and just know you'll be a wonderful mama! ❤
Thanks for sharing, lots of ❤ for the Baby!
I’m so happy for you guys!!!! Can’t not wait to meet this little baby and continue to watch this family grown with so much love ❤️ I’m watching you from Manaus, BRAZIL! 🇧🇷🇧🇷
why wouldnt you name your baby after leigh??? (or lee )  ya......... your best friend in the world, and whom you dedicate at least a 1/4 of your life to remembering ????
calf pain:  perhaps your ferritin levels are lower than they think, don't just go by hemoglobin...have them check your actual ferritin levels.  Or perhaps magnesium.  I take both now due to muscle cramping, especially in my legs at night.
Hope you see this but as a mother to one 24 Yr old and a 22yr old this video is one of my favourites so far. Loving the reminder of what it was like to be pregnant and yes you can blame everything on pregnancy brain!
When Eamon looked over at osso, and said "we got it pretty good kiddo".. I was almost in tears. It's so beautiful to be grateful,  but then Eamon ended that sentence in such an Eamon way. 😂
It's so interesting how I clicked on a random van build video three years ago and now I feel like I know you two.   I'm excited for what's ahead for you; parenthood is a very special gift : ) God bless : )
As a 25 year BC survivor I need to share with you a warning about sugar being a major fuel source for cancer. Doctor's won't tell you this. Beware dear ❤
Bec, lijepo ti stoji trudnoća.
💜
If Oso is chewing rocks he is probably needing minerals that are missing from his diet.  Please dont give hm honey.     Bec’s cramps could be a lack of magnesium.    Love the new path.    Hugs from Australia. 🇦🇺🌈🦋💓
Moving to Toronto? Are you selling the cabin?
We just had our second babe!  It’s wild and amazing!!  Happy for you guys!
Bec don’t forget your lower back and hips with that oil as it will also stretch. Even though u look great and probably the fittest pregnant woman I’ve ever seen those stretch marks are sneaky.
Bec is 6 months already! Holy moly! Time has defiantly flown by, you guys are going to be amazing parents!!
I have a question, why are you guys doing upgrades and renovations to this house if you guys are moving to Toronto?❤❤❤
My sweet tooth came out during pregnancy too same time as you and let me just say it doesn’t really go away lol
24 week my baby Resting on my kidney The pain is terrible. But as you mentioned, nothing compares to his kicks inside me❤❤❤❤❤
Yaaay❤so happy for you both 🙏🏾♥️
I've given birth 3 times, and each one of those leg cramps was a very real thing. I would come up out of a dead sleep 😬😬😬, I took potassium, Dr said so and bananas, it HELPED!!! Tremendously!!!
Oso's drool factor😂
Im 16 weeks with our second kiddo, both fertility made. This time around i have had no sickness, so it feels easier - but my new job dont fit pregnantsy! hahahah  Im a preschool teacher, that dont want to play tag - Im just too exhausted! Becomming a parent (already when pregnant) it is forever ambivilent. To qoute my fiance: our lives have never been this hard, yet we have never been this happy! Words cant desribe how happy i am for you guys, you are already great parents!
From here on you will grow exponentially and it will not be long before you start walking the waddle.  Have fun. I only had one, but the experience made me a better person all the way around. He is 35 now and has his only one (6 year old boy).
I love you guys! You’re so honest and open about so many important things… and thus help others! How incredible that you are using your platform for this reason, among many others! Thank you! And I canNOT wait to meet baby girl! She incredibly lucky to be blessed by you two!
Did I miss something are you moving?!
Where do you live? It's beautiful!
Just a caution, eating rocks and dirt can be a mineral deficiency in dogs, like pica, it can also break their teeth or cause bowel obstructions if he swallows them.   He may be satisfied with a nylabone if he just likes to chew on things, but if he eats a lot of rocks, I’d error on the side of safety and get him checked by a vet, and ask for some redirection advice.  Cheers on the six month mark!  So happy for you two!
You guys are moving????
Love the walkway! Glad you are looking so healthy and happy Bec! Love from the States!🤩
Are you selling the cabin?
Bec, I got 3 names for you:  Amy Lee, Becky Lee, Sara Lee.  Just suggestions love ya!  Terri
Bec-I’m due in Nov with my first girl and the pelvic pain is real.  But feeling her move is EVERYTHING!! What’s your most reoccurring craving? Mine is cucumbers and ice water.
one of my dogs hes a bull mastiff he'll chew on rocks, sticks, boulders 😂😂😂😂😂
I'm so so happy for you guys. This is the first video I'm watching since I miscarried with my baby boy last month, i was 12 weeks and 6 days pregnant when i lost him. I'm happy I can smile and find so much joy through your guys videos through one of the hardest times in my life. I was so excited to be pregnant at the same time as you guys ❤️
Since you’re pregnant you’re basically a submarine for your baby when you go swimming
Bec is amazing ❤ Eamon is already a such a great dad.
Because, you are an amazing lady and the care you are taking of your body is so awesome....one tiny suggestion from a complete stranger..also a vegetarian....please do some serious research and study on soy products....just just some unsolicited advice, given to you by a 68 year old lady with respect and love.
You look Great, Bec! Why are you moving to Toronto and when? You live in self created Paradise!! Great place to raise a child. ❤
Currently 31 weeks pregnant with baby girl #2 and definitely having really bad pelvic pain this time around. So sorry you’re also going through that but it’s totally worth it for baby ❤
Eamon and Bec, you two have this pregnancy down to an art!  I love how open and honest you speak about what you have experienced in the past year and a half.  I know that you are helping someone out there.  My babies are 36 and 35 so it’s been awhile since I’ve been pregnant. I know that I needed this encouragement and support when I was pregnant (in 1986).  I love how you two encourage, support and love each other- that’s all you need!   Aren’t our bodies amazing though?  We produce a hormone that causes our hips to open up as the pregnancy progresses. To me that’s just amazing, our bodies know exactly what to do.  Love my Sunday mornings because I know I have your videos to look forward to.
For the love of God!! How many times can she say I'm 6 months pregnant?!
Bec you look beautiful. When you let your hair down, it is Ava Gardener moments. The waves are so cute. I am so happy for you both. Your life life together is such a beautiful blessing to watch! Your baby so so blessed to have you both and Oso too!
You guys are amazing. So excited about "baby girls" arrival.  Ps. When the baby is there, Bec will probably sit in the back of the car with the baby to start with.... it makes it easier when they get fractious.  Weight for the last month of pregnancy.. you think you can't get fatter, but you do because that last month the baby is fattening up in preparation for loosing a bit of weight after the birth... Enjoy the ride.
Currently 40 weeks 2 days and surprised at how sad and defeated I feel that she’s not here yet 😢 it’s like I know logically that I can go two weeks over, due dates are estimations etc etc but for some reason it’s been really weighing on me (and my hormones) lol my husband and I have been watching you guys since 2016, you were the blueprint for our own van build and adventure and now we’re pregnant at the same time? Life’s weirddd
So not vegan anymore?
My little guy just turned 13 months, and I was having the same problems with hips and cramping. My OB had me use Calm with calcium. It helped so much. Worth the ask. You are doing great, mama!
FWIW, my mother said she used to be able to sleep through the loudest thunderstorms,etc. before she gave birth to my oldest sib but ever since then she'd awaken at hearing a pin drop because she felt she needed to be alert to offspring!
11.5 months post partum! Lol on breastfeeding journey still. Savor every day!
Pelvis expending didnt hurt me, but  the retraction after birth  to normal was so painful .
Love the video and hearing about how things are going with the pregnancy! Great days! My two are 34 and 28. Life is beautiful.
What did you mean when you said you were moving to I think you said Toronto? Are you selling that house at the lake?
I’m so happy that i found your channel! i’ve been watching for three years and you guys are a huge inspiration. I love Becs courage and positivity and Eamonss humor! Love you 2 can’t wait for baby girl!🫶🏻🫶🏻
You two just make me laugh. You both are just amazing and can’t wait for this next journey of your life.❤️❤️
Hey Eamon, nice what you said about "women", but you know, men are pretty incredible too!  55 years with the same "big sweet guy" here. He must be doing something right... AND, most of them can back up a trailer and I still can't. ARGH! (Gad Bec, you are BLOOMING!)
🥰😍🤩💚💛💚💚💛💚
Wow momma, you are glowing…. Beautiful…❤❤❤
Moving!? Omgosh why!?
You guys are funny! Glad I found you!
Think stroller
Love this video. You both are simply amazing . Bec you are radiant! Eamon I have so much respect and admiration for you. You take such great care of Bec,as she you. Both of you are going to be fantastic parents. Much love.❤
Sending love from Chicago!!  Love you guys 😘
16.5 weeks pregnant and love having a pregnant friend!!
Eamon (Ken) is so supportive! Bec is so cute in her pregnancy! Everyone has a different experience. My "baby" is now older that you both, but I still remember my physical changes and cravings. Towards the end of my term, I couldn't wait to have my baby! But after having the baby, I got no sleep. You are smart to be with family for the birth of your baby. I had lots of help from my mom and female friends! Your SUV was a wise choice, but Oso should be tethered while riding in the car. He can wear a harness and a detachable strap that clicks into the seat belt clip. It will keep him safe in case there is an accident, and it will keep him from trying to sit up front. The walkway looks awesome! Funny that I was looking at finding some broken concrete for steps for a walkway this morning!
Love you two. Love seeing you cherish pregnancy- it goes so fast ❤ Pro tip on the honey- contact with metal like a spoon, damages a lot of the good enzyme and other beneficial stuff inside honey. Opt for a wood or silicone spoon 😊 Have a great week!
Hello, ive been watching you guys for a few years now. Your videos are so good for my mental health. I love that you can make a day in the life so interesting, loved thats the music got quieter under water! Im from ontario too, and was so excited when I looked over and saw chai wala when I was driving on the 401 one time! Hopefully ill be able to come to a meet up one day
3 videos 3 weeks in a row... I'm loving this!! And I'm loving the direction your channel has gone!
Oh! Did I see an Easter egg for baby girl’s name…..  Anyone else? It would be perfect btw!
21 weeks! Lots of pelvic pain and heartburn right now 🥲 worth it to feel my girl ❤️
So proud of both of you and your good boy. ❤ I love that you both work hard play hard...you are satisfied but pushing forward. You are a joy to watch!
I watched your IVF journey knowing I was about to start the same journey in January of 2023. And now I am about to go to my 20-week scan. It's been a journey I didn't think at 35 we were going to have to do to get here. But I am so excited next week will let everyone know that my 2 dogs are going to be big brothers to their human sister. Keep sharing ur journey and as my husband has been saying the class of 2041 is going to be huge with the amount of babies we know being born in 2024.
FYI:  soy milk is not good for people to drink on the regular !  I craved sweets too when I was pregnant with my son, with my daughter it was spicy Doritos .   Also get as much sleep now because when baby comes sleeping is rare commodity! 😊
Food…Shelter… and Sex! 😂😂😂😂
My daughter is due on December 25th for her first child and our first grandchild.  A boy...Sutton  Thomas  Reeves.
@Eamon & Bec Bec what is your facial retiene? What are the products you were using? Thanks. :)
Move to Toronto?
Pregnant women should be able to complain all they want... you are growing a human being 🤯😂
Had a question, Bec 😂 are you using one of those pregnancy pillows? My daughter looking for one. We can’t find anything in this small town
My mom's friend actually was in the exact same situation as you. Had gone through chemo and gave birth to a healthy baby girl not a year apart. Literally insane how good the body is at protecting the baby inside.
Ich liebe eure Videos. Gute Fahrt aus Wien 😉😉😉
Love the life you have created and look forward to baby girl joining in your journey and seeing her run around the cabin❤️
Bec you look so radiantly beautiful. Eamon your a goid chef and workers . Thanks for taking care if Bec.😊❤
Thats a alligator snapping turtle.  They can reach their head to their tail. They bite fast. I have one. We dont put our fingers near his tank at all.
Bec, you’ve been through some incredible lows and highs in the past year. You’ve got to appreciate all you two have been through. I am currently 10 weeks pregnant with our third (and final) baby. We have 2 toddlers under 3. And I am hitting 35 next month. My husband and I lived our 20’s but since we’ve had our children it’s made our bond stronger than it’s ever been. I see my life in color now. It’ll be a deep love that you never imagined you could feel loving your baby. It’s the hardest thing I’ve ever done but I wouldn’t change it for the world ❤
Love you guys ❤ but not loving the tattoos,sorry 😢
Wait Ayman there is one period after baby born is the worst not about baby but the mother monthly health wise trifide
Super disturbed they would trust in a doula…they literally clash with doctors/midwives when advising patient care when they don’t have any where near the same amount of knowledge/education. I hope they don’t have a “birth plan,” things are not going to ever go how you expect, again this is just going to be in the way of the physicians trying to assist you. Patients googling everything is also super annoying, if you’re not specialized in OBGYN please don’t pretend so you don’t put your kid at risk because you imagined or wanted it to go a certain way.
I haven’t even started to watch and I’m so excited!!! ❤❤❤
You guys are the best love you so much. 🇨🇦🥰😎🤩
You looking so radiant ❤. God bless.
Leg cramps my doctor said to eat a banana a day or take potassium
❤❤❤❤
Happy for your journey, your a beautiful family.👨‍👨‍👧🦮🥦🥬🥝
The baby should not be sitting in the front, the spot diagonally behind the driver is the safest. They wouldn't sit in the front until they are 12 years old
I really love creeping thyme as a ground cover to plant between stones.  It spreads easily, is hardy and so soft on the feet, plus no need to mow or trim. It stays less than two inches high and flowers with tiny purple flowers now and then.
I’ve had terrible calf cramping all three pregnancies. I would avoid stretching in the middle of the night because that would egg on a huge leg cramp
Omg that deer scene 😆🤣😂
Did you know when your pregnant the baby's fathers DNA is found in the Baby's mother's blood  for decades .So this would explain how you are becoming like Eamon
3 years ago, on our way home from a holiday in Scotland I watched my first of your videos. Today, on our way home from another holiday in Scotland I’ve watched this video!! Love following your journey! I’ve laughed with you and cried with you. Can’t wait to see more. Sending so much love xx
Wait! Are you leaving the cabin? Why? 😭😭
We are due on Oct 16th! With a little girl! Our pregnancy journey has not been easy unfortunately our baby had a positive trisomy 13 test and the Drs think she may have a form of skeletal dysphasia. But I’m still hoping they are wrong and she is going to be healthy happy baby girl! I hope yours goes more smoothly! Good luck!
Hi from northern BC. Found your guys videos during Covid and it was a life saver. 💖💖 congrats on the pregnancy what a blessing. All the best to you all.
I had my 3rd baby 3 months ago ❤😊 so happy for you guys. You hardly sympathy with hip pain I struggled in my last 2 pregnancies xx
OMGosh Bec!!. Pregnancy looks good on you girl!
Glad to see it going well for you both and the little one on the way.
My dog also chews on rocks
Yall are awesome!
Please read about soy!😮
You two are just perfection and brighten up my sundays
Bec and Emon! Love both of vibes! I’m watching from the central coast of California! Both of you are so inspirational and love that Emon is a jack of all trades! Bec you are so amazing, you are such a beautiful light! Many blessings to your family! Oh yeah! Love oso bear!!
try Lil pickle juice for cramping in legs
Actually, I am starting my first round of Letrozol tomorrow to see if we can't get that ovulation going!  My son is 6 and we lost his sibling 4 years ago in the first trimester, so this is such a big step for us.  Hoping to have a little one on the way soon!
Bec you light up the internet with all you do!! & You’re baby girl will be the most beautiful baby girl no doubt! As a mom of 4 girls you are in for the most bonding experience you’ll get. Now you’re just feeling a sliver of it. To the best parents on YouTube 🥂 I’m celebrating every time I see your videos ♥️ ✌️ Walkway is magnificent btw 😉
The road to this pregnancy was NOT „rocky“, it was a shitload on a shitload of rocks on top of even more rocks, but you handled it with so much grace and courage and tenderness that it makes me cry every time I see that belly. I could not be happier for you!
I'm 35 weeks with my rainbow baby after 2 losses and I love and appreciate every single good and bad part of pregnancy, so I agree, I wouldn't trade it for anything! Women are amazing! I get those horrendous calf cramps too though, and most recently I get leg cramps all the way up to my thighs, groin, and the back of my thighs too. My doctor recommended taking magnesium which has been helping to reduce the cramps for sure, so maybe give that a try too! :)
Should be interesting who gets up for feedings😀😀😀😀
Bec, Do you plan on growing your hair out long or are you going to go pixie short?
I actually get excited when I get a notification that you’ve posted a new video. And I’m 62 years old!  Thank you for sharing your lives with us.
You're moving? You're not living in the cabin anymore?
you want grass Lil bit higher then stone so mower doesn't hit stone
Please have a vet check Oso. When I was growing up, my grandma's dog ate rocks, and, it turned out she had pancreatitis.
Nice video and edited. I guess Oso is going on a run for a week now and Eamon on one weel for a week😂 by the way are you guys selling and moving avay from the cabin? Diflucan I understand that right Bec?  also  hi from Norway
Bec is going to be the best mom ever!!! 💕
don't go to deep cause you'll have to back fill
🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
I'm 3 months pregnant so it's nice seeing someone just a bit ahead of me! What belly oil are you using in the video?
stepping stone last
Such a very sweet video!  Your happiness is contagious!  God bless y’all.  Rest up for next video and as always content is delightful!  Hugs , ❤❤❤CarrieJo/NC
Bec is a human submarine

I am just beginning my cancer journey. Drawing strength from your journey, thank you for being so vulnerable and allowing us in.
You look like Emma Watson!!
The path looks amazing. Good luck keeping the Bear off. Xx
Congratulations on this new journey for you and your hubby. I just gave birth to my second little girl on September 8th, it was an easy labor and delivery 😊
Bec you are radiant ❤
My wife and I are very happy and excited for you guys ❤
Im 28 weeks 🎉 from South Africa. Due 14 December. Im a first grade teacher and have had to put alot of my exercise and hobbies on hold as the exhaustion is too much. I also hate the feeling of not being able to help out much.  Wishing all the lovely mammas a healthy and happy pregnancy.  ❤❤
I also had SPD while pregnant - try getting a body pillow for sleeping and it really helps with the pain while sleeping!
Bec you look amazing! Emon, you're the best. Love you guys
Gorgeous Bec! Hello from Albuquerque, New Mexico! I look forward to your videos every Sunday!
Just wait till that baby arrives. You will know no other joy and love than this baby. It’s the best thing saying hi from Wisconsin with love and God bless.
Hi Eamon and Bec. Congratulations to 6months. You looks so beautiful Bec’s your blooming pregnancy suits you.  The  path  looks so good especially when the green grass sprouts through. Nifty cooking skills Eamon. Take care of yourselves stay safe till next time.💕🙏
Blessings to you and Eamon as life begets life! Joyful life! What’s your due date?
They’re moving? What did I miss?
You both are going to be such fantastic parents. Thank you for taking us along on the start of this new adventure. ❤
Bec your little baby numb is beautiful and you two are the cutest.
You need magnesium for the cramps in your legs Bec👌 Get a supplement and you will very likely be rid of them 🥰
You have to stop with the Better Help.They are a horrible company.  Other than that, great video.
our friend n neighbor just had to take their dog to er vet for swallowing a rock
It’s already been 6 months?! That’s wild! So happy for y’all! Would you say our YouTube family is getting bigger, Eamon and Bec? Any names planned for the baby? Is Oso excited for a sibling? You think he’s ready to be a big brother?
I look forward to you and Kara and Nates vids every weekend ❤  Edit: WHAAAT YOU HAVE A TAP ABOVE YOUR STOVE?!
I enjoy these videos, I do, I just wonder why my life did not work out the same, that I do not own a house. What I do like is the way you have your own business, which in fact I used to except that life was not serving me anymore. Unfortunately, I learned the lesson too late and have had my career destroyed. Bec recovered from cancer, and I only hope that I will get cancer so that I will die. Oh life.
Oh my goodness I can’t believe you’re already 6 months. Wow I’m so happy for y’all ❤
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏💖💖💖💖💖💖💖😀😍my heart is happy
Sooo aggressive Eamon...😮😮
Water it and it will grow.
Guys, who was Lee?  I’ve been here for a while but Lee was before my time.  I understand from references Lee was someone very important to them but I’m just wondering who she was.  Thanks. 😊
You guys are so talented with creating videos and editing! It's so entertaining! Love how you dulled the music when yall went under water in the lake. Details like that just make the video.
You two are going to be amazing parents 💯👏🙌🙏
That belly 🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹
Love, love
I am so happy for you.  But I have been wondering how the dog shelter in Baja has fared since the hurricane?  Can we have an update please?
Bec is a superstar! What breed is Oso and how often do you bathe him? I'd love to have a dog like Oso. Maybe you can make a video just all about Oso!❤❤❤
As a turtle rehabber (in Mississippi) who is also beginning a battle with breast cancer, I need to say thank you. Thank you, Bec, for sharing your journey with breast cancer with us. You're inspirational to me and I strive to be as strong as you were. I know I can beat it too. And Eamon, thank you for saving the turtle! ❤ We actually named two of of our rescue turtles Eamon and Bec this year.🐢
Love the new path, it's just right for your house. Even if it was more challenging than expected, it turned out so well. That chef's challenge cracked me up. My dog likes to see Oso on the screen, but I'm hoping she doesn't pick up rock eating from him. ;) Hurrah for Sod Man and Water Woman!!!
You are looking so well Bec, prettier then ever...a typical pregnancy beauty...so happy for you both❤🎉
Becky where did you get the cup I’ve been looking everywhere
Hello, I just found you guys and I love the videos.  I am in a bit of a hard moment, but, the videos are helping me and giving me inspiration! I love your style, mindset, and eating habits; I identify myself with you guys so much.  Wish you a lot of love and happiness to you three and Oso.
Move to Toronto?  After all the work you've done on your cabin in the woods, why would you move back to the city?  Are you selling the place?
I just love you guys. Y’all are so sweet and kind. I love your channel. Thank you for sharing your journey with us! God bless you!
Love your house, greetings from Amsterdam 🇳🇱🌷
can't wait for leaves to change
Hey guys I am form Alberta Bec you look great keep up the great work 👍 🙂
I love the name Waverly. Hoping to be married and pregnant next year but we'll see!!
Extra calcium will help a lot with the leg cramps. A tip from my OB many years ago.
So happy for you both! Question, how did you protect your eggs from the chemo?
Beautiful bump and a very nice walkway🤠❤️
Hi guys!! Lots of love from Michigan!! I’m so happy for you guys with your baby on the way❤️❤️❤️ Love you both!
Love u all u are awesome and enjoying seeing your videos!!
Topical Magnesium oil spray for the cramping calves, it’s a Godsend and great for you regardless! And if you end up getting sciatica nerve pain, I’m telling you it worked so so well for lots of stuff like headaches as well and I swear by it to all pregnant mamas 👏🏼👏🏼
The pathway looks great. If the grass does not take, there is ground cover you can plant that can be walked on and not have to be mowed. Bec looks great at 6 months pregnant.
Becc wavin the good fart 😂
We have the same due date!!!! This 3rd trimester exhaustion hits hard especially when chasing around my 1year old. 😂😂
I remember while pregnant getting stinging pains, almost like a muscle tear in what I thought was my lower abdomen and it freaked me out so much I rushed to the doctor. Found out it was womb stretching and it stung like a bugger!!!
Oso drooling waiting for you to say ok, is the best! I love it! Bec, you look amazing! So happy for y’all! Hope you have a an amazing week!
You are both awesome xx
My girls are entering adulthood, but I’ll never forget just how uncomfortable pregnancy can be. It’s all encompassing feeling of discomfort at times, and that can be a mindfuck. You want to be so grateful for growing a human but you also need to be able to talk about just how uncomfortable it can be and it not seem like you’re complaining or unhappy. You’re not, you’re just being honest. As beautiful and amazing as the process is, it just isn’t always rainbows and butterflies 🤷🏻‍♀️
Is the pelvic pain what some pregnant folks lovingly refer to as “lightning ⚡️crotch?”
Love seeing the bump updates. You’re about 6 weeks ahead of me! This is my second so it’s so incredibly wonderful watching a first time mama experiencing it! The nesting urge is so strong!! You’re going to make a great little nest for your baby girl! We’re also expecting a girl! They are awesome!
in your 20s its babe, in your 30s its honey and i guess in your 40s its darling
Yall are so amazing with everything that you have gone thru 👍 yes my pup tries to eat small rocks 🥺, i discourage it as much as possible..keep up the great work yall are doing, blessings to your family ❤️🙏
Wow your place keeps growing in beauty.  Love your visions! Love to baby girl! 💖
❤
You're moving to Toronto?
I'm 8 weeks pregnant as of yesterday. Anxiety is real because I had a missed miscarriage in April. I'm 33 years old and am ready for a baby. Not sure if my age was a reason for loosing my first pregnancy.. Never have I imagined it being so hard to have a family. Last time we found out at our 12 week scan that there was no heartbeat. This time as I'm nearing closer and closer to 12 weeks again I feel like my anxiety is overwhelming and all I can do is pray to God that I get a healthy baby next May ❤
I just love your dog.  He fits right in with the both of you.  He makes me laugh.  I love your place.
Why the move to Ontario and for how long?
Lol 😂  @24:59 Watching the deer 🦌 in the meadow followed by Eamon slurping from the straw!! Lol 😂 I almost peed my pants!! ❤  Love from the Coast of Oregon in Winchester Bay. 🇺🇲 #davesandersstepdaughter
looks like Oso is preparing you how it is to have a toddler
#BringBackFreestyleFridays 😂
Just out of professional curiosity, no need to answer if too personal but in the beginning of your pregnancy you said your irradiated Breast was smaller. With time and hormonal changes has it caught up to your other breast and is it more painful than the other?
Your belly popped out all the sudden Bec! So cute!❤
Dog in front, baby in the back ❤
I love how excited I get to make my coffee, light my candle, and put your videos on ✨✨ best part of the whole weekend 💖
Great video and proud of you guys working together and making things work, in your life and around the house. Bec you look more and more beautiful each day and Eamon thanks for being the support and good man to your family and others. See you next Sunday.  ❤🐾🌟✌
Cruel…please. I should have Oso’s life 😎
I"ll be 37 weeks tomorrow! Ready to meet baby and over being pregnant at this point LOL!
Bec you seem kinda down.  I know you have been a very active person and you aren't able to be that.  Your body is using incredible energy to produce a beautiful baby girl.  I read once it is the same energy required to climb Mt. Everest.  The hip pain is the hormones being released to allow the hips and pelvis prepare for child birth.  34 years ago I remember stepping off a sidewalk and thinking, "Oh that really hurt my crotch!"  No one had told me about it, nor had it appeared in any of the pregnancy books.  The stuff women don't share is sad.  It is normal to feel a bit blue, body and life changes.   Hugs to you both. Eamon you are a sweet guy.
Heeeey 👋...I really love U guys❤️...ur just sooo authentically fun👍😜....CONGRATS ON "LIL E&B🎉🎉#INSPIRING..#GOOSO🤗😁🙏💪✌️
I do won't to try your teas but I don't know witch one to try first but do u all send to Ohio
Watching from Sweden with my 6 month old little baby boy ❤️ I have been following and watching you since 2019 end 2020 beginning 🥰 love your videos ❤
WHO ELSE IS SO EXCITED FOR A MINI EAMON AND BEC ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Eamon Is so funny (AND so ken) !! AND bec Is so power women
The “ohhhhhhh chefffffffff” from bec took me out 😂😂😂😂😂
it’s a great video absolutely loved it, Eamons “food shelter and se-“  was perfection 😂😂
SEE YOU NEXT SUNDAY.     HONEY😊
Loved being pregnant! One thing that helps is pelvic floor exercises! They never tell you what it is like after baby is born but this will save you. No joke! Enjoyed every minute of your videos. ❤❤
I’m at 35 weeks and agree that baby kicks are the best! Such amazing reassurance. We’re waiting until birth to find out gender and it is hard sometimes not to have that extra bit of connection. Thank you for sharing your journey with us!
I love watching you guys!!!  Can’t imagine you living anywhere else!!
you are lucky that you can still drink and eat these different foods, like coffee, curry, spice, …i was sick of the smell of all my favourite foods 😅
I found you guys while going through breast cancer treatment at age 30!!! I am now in my last week of radiation treatment!!! You both give me a lot of hope!!!! Even after cancer we still can live our lives to the fullest!!! So happy for you two!!!
I’m currently 17 weeks and 2 days . Totally been feeling up and downs with this pregnancy also a first time mom
Your looking blooming good Bec. My sisters partner just completed her journey with breast cancer.  All going well so far. Sending lots of love a best wishes from the North of Scotland x❤❤❤❤❤❤
I LOVE YALL VIDEOS THEY SO PEACEFUL
😂😂😂 I had a dog that would eat rocks also.
Just LOVE this family! Been watching for years. Thank you for being you! 😍
Amid all the much more significant comments, I just have to say that Eamon saving the turtle was so darn cute. And then I realized how funny it was that he had to stop, film the stop, set up a shot for when he moved the turtle, etc. I laughed out loud picturing the scene.
I was double size 192  lbs of baby at 35 years old single mother father was Japanese wealthy father refusing to be supportive courts never helped woman in British Columbia we   suffered as lawyers never met with financial support living with unhealthy family members drunks.
I absolutely love your videos!! You guys are just too funny! Your cabin is also so gorgeous too, you're living the dream! Love you both <3
Hi all the way from South Africa. I was look forward to your videos it always puts me in a good head space. Sending little baby girl lots of love
Beautiful  family xxx
I'm pregnant too, week16! So glad for you guys!
while a very different journey from cancer, i can certainly relate to feeling like my body has been through it in the last 12 months. i was pregnant, had a miscarriage that required surgery, did four rounds of ivf and am now hoping to be pregnant. as much as i appreciate all my body has been through, its hard to not also feel like it has failed me and i have failed it some days. sending you lots of positivity in this next round of changes, bec! you are inspiring.
My daughter is 20 weeks about 22 lol I’m enjoying the journey with her, I joy of watching your grand daughter, coming , yeah she’s having a girl. Biggest change was she smells everything I told her to watch your channel,
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤Ya’ll
Love your videos!! My youngest son is our dragonfly too. He was struck on his motorcycle and didn’t make it. We see them so much more now.
Bec, do you ever feel like a reconstruction project gone insane? The walls are all moving, the plumbing has been rearranged, the furnishings had to be replaced, and the foundation shifts daily. 😁 You can dangle your legs in the hot tub for the cramping, just don't submerge.
Ah, yes; todays blog brought back memories of my pregnancies (my boys were born 25 months apart): hip pain!  Yes indeed Bec! Your body’s doing just what it needs to do - getting all those bones, ligaments, and muscles ready to bring Baby Girl into the world in 3 more months❣️.  I had calf pain too, usually in the middle of the night - felt like a “Charlie horse” , aaarrrggghhh. . . check with your obgyn because you may need more potassium, which is usually the thing for muscle cramping, especially leg cramps.  You go girl — you’re an excellent preggers woman!!!!  Do what you can do for yourself now, that’ll be tough to do once she arrives, and don’t worry about any naysayers❣️ it’s your, and your precious baby’s bodies and if you can’t do all the things you used to do that’s The Goddess Mother Nature guiding you through the path to Motherhood! Thinking of you often❤️!!! 💜🌺🩷🪻❤️🍀💓🪷💕🌼💖🌷💗🌻💞🌹🌼💖☮️
So incredibly happy for you both💗 Love your cabin and beautiful property!!! I am watching from “across the pond” in Rochester, NY😄🇺🇸
LOVE YOU  BOTH ❤❤❤❤
20 weeks🫶✨
I saw your IG post about Sunday comments so popping over here to say it makes me so happy to see you guys thriving! Your hard work is always so inspiring. We are in Houston, TX (originally from Ohio) and have two teenagers, so you’re bringing back all of the pregnancy memories for me. 🤗🥰
Eamon and Bec, I have been watching your videos for a couple of years now but I just wanna say that every time I watch one of your vids I feel so overwhelmed with happiness. Your videos are truly amazing and it's an amazing little escape to dream what I would like my future to look like. Thanks a lot for posting your incredible videos. I really appreciate you! Your baby's gonna have the best parents <3
This is like the ultimate comfort channel! There’s been ups and downs but you both are such positive and amazing people. I wish the best for you always!!
Osso seems like a chill dog but have you ever played the sound of babies crying to see how he is?
Such a beautiful testimony! Yes- to life! For the good, the bad, and the ugly! Love it!❤
I am going miss the cabin so much when you move to the city. Can’t wait to meet baby girl!
Just had our first loss at about 6 weeks. Hope we can get back on track soon. Love your vids guys, love from London x
New subbie! Wishing you the best on your pregnancy journey and praise God for your healing🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾
Eamon - you are Kenough 😂 Super cute video guys!
So you are going to move?? Thought I read this wrong in the captions. Well what a big change it’ll be -I love your cabin location and having nature all around. Hope you don’t sell it! Happy for baby girl to arrive. You’re gonna have so much fun! 👍
Your recap of the timeline gave me goosebumps, Bec. So full of wonder and gratitude. ...I'm thinking this is a great time for both of you to rest up, since in a few short months you will never sleep the same...Hugs to Osso
26 weeks today!!! Love seeing your journey. You’re so blesssed to have a partner like Amon. Sending you all love🫶🏼
My daughter is 19 years old. But it seems like yesterday I was pregnant with her. My eighth and my ninth month was probably my hardest. The most uncomfortable being that my daughter was born July 8, so I went through the hottest part of the summer heat. I live in the Vegas area, and the heat is awful during those months, that was probably the hardest part. But I’m glad that I had both of my babies in the summer time. My son was born July 4 and his sister was born July 8, 11 years later. I was 29 years old when I had my daughter. The time goes by so fast. So enjoy every little minute from giving her a bath to feeding her a bottle to enjoying all of those big milestones. I even remember the first day I took her to preschool and she ran up to the door and her little hands were trying to open the door and she needed some help. Now she’s in her third year of college and dating her first boyfriend she’s so independent and the time goes by in the blink of an eye. Enjoy every single second of it! Having a daughter is one of the greatest gifts God can ever give us. You obviously know you love your daughter now that she’s in your belly. But you know you won’t know what real love is until you actually see her for the first time when she is born. That’s when it will hit you like a ton of bricks that you would literally give your life for her. I’m so excited to see you go through this journey.❤❤❤❤❤
Love you three...soon to be four!! Thank you for sharing your amazing existence with us!!   Love the love you share, with each other and with your family and friends!   Maybe I missed something but did I hear your moving to Toronto??? What about the cabin??   ❤
A fun read is how the fetus heals the mother from the inside. Healing   mom organs, hormones, etc. So that they are able to both survive and improve their chaces of a full term delivery. ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I have heard that brags vinegar can help you assimilate Calcium into your body so you don’t have leg cramps… Works for me… in North Carolina
Haha oh my gosh the scene with the deer and then Elon sipping the drink!!! My husband and I are sick in bed and dying laughing 😂
What does "want to get our greens and blues?" Mean at 3:29?
Bec you look absolutely amazing.. you and Eamon will make great parents.   Just make sure you get rest when you need to..
Congrats. 22 yrs ago I went thru similar cancer treatments. I am male though and mine was testicular cancer. They told me I might not be able to have more kids. My second son just celebrated his 20th birthday. Enjoy every second of it!
My husband and I watch your videos every Sunday (if there's a new video)! After going through cancer, and not being able to conceive, I truly enjoy watching your journey. We love you three - and Oso dog! ❤❤
Heading into month 9 of pregnancy over here with my first - its a boy!  If I have any advice, take the bump pictures!  Love watching you experience the milestones of pregnancy, youre not alone and the best is yet to come. The kicks are so special at 6 months, but just wait. 🥰  Cant wait to keep up with you & your pregnancy journey, you are strong momma.💪🏼
Listen - and listen caaaarefully. This channel puts a pause on my world. I am at peace when I watch you guys. You are an instant “pick me up and make be better”. Thank you. THANK YOU!
Has she had the hiccups yet? That's the one part of pregnancy I could live without! LOL It was amazing at first, but after the 10th time, it would drive me bonkers lol
Yes, our dog ate rocks and unfortunately it killed her.  Be careful Oslo. ❤️
I love this growing family ❤
You mentioned y’all are moving to Toronto, is that just until the baby is born or permanently?
🐾 Yo, if you want Oso to sit in the rear, you'll need to make that a nice, comfy place for him, not sharing it with a bunch of stuffs! You're lucky to have him in your lives and videos. When the baby comes and all her stuffs go infront, Oso will automatically understand why he goes in the back. 🙏 Right now, please spoil him a little before the baby comes. 🐾 Remember, that's the only "child" you're gonna have who'll love you unconditionally, won't cost you $300,000 CAN to raise to 18yrs, and reduces stresses in your life instead of adds to it.
Currently 27 weeks and absolutely loving these vlogs ❤ we’re currently doing our birthing classes and feel so much joy and excitement for this new chapter! Watching you both prepare for baby has been such a treat!
Bec, you are so incredibly strong! You have Eamon have endured so much in the past year and I’m so happy to see you so filled with joy, I just know that your two are going to be amazing parents, love you guys!❤️
The pelvic floor pain is real!! I remember feeling like my pelvic was a wishbone about to break! Sending love to you all!! 💞💓💞
Oh the calf cramps 🙈😣 they were brutal!!!    You look amazing 🤩 Eamon is an awesome hubs!!  And also will be an amazing big bro!
I’m 38 weeks today! So close to meeting my baby boy and sooo excited. I’m so very happy for you both and excited to see y’all become parents!
Tell amend  that he is not handy like he thinks he is lol
Bec and I have on the same sweatshirt! 😀. Bec, you are the most amazing human!
This video will be great for your daughter to look back on how cool her parents use to be...❤
Bec, I’m sure you know this, but I just found it so awesome to think about when I was pregnant with my daughter… you are also growing the eggs that will become your grandchildren right now!
bec has come so far from not even being able to walk down her road, to walking with oso and baby girl. IM SOBBING!!!!!!!!
It was so, so many years when I found your channel along with the Matney's and began my introduction into van life. I've watched you guys grow up it feels like! I'm so, so very happy for both of you and having had my daughter, Bec, there will always be ups and downs but the ups are so so so worth any low points ever! Eamon, you've got every right to be proud and happy of your life right now. Lots of love to you two!
I'm  very happy for your wonderful progress!😂❤
I’m currently 14 weeks mamas!!! I love sharing this journey with y’all after watching you for so long!!!!!! I’m having a boy! Thank you for making these video! ❤
I‘m watching from Switzerland. I‘m enjoying a nice sunny evening with my husband. We are currently trying to get pregnant and I can‘t wait for everything that will change with pregnancy. Have a wonderful sunday!
You guys are just too cute for words!! I love the relationship you have and watching it mature and thrive over the years, I’ve been keeping tabs on you two…… what an Amazing journey and adventure you both have been on since you started van-life! The places, the people you’ve met and the friends you have grown to love in that community! Then remodeling and moving to the cabin in the woods, that was stunning to watch how creative Eamon is in finishing the place Now that you’re onto the next phase of something new and exciting, after a trying year into an absolute joyous one, remodeling you’re body and souls for Becca and Eamon is along for this ride and taking such good care of his girls!! You guys make me laugh hard, think about how much we are SO Blessed, and you make me cry!! Thanks for taking us with you on all of your adventures, the good the bad and the ugly!! AND Oso is such a great dog, he’s almost human but not…. Love you guys, Stay Safe and Be Well!!!
I can't be the only one who feels like Bec's pregnancy is zooming!! You are absolutely crushing pregnancy, Bec! I'm so excited for you two to welcome baby Fitz into the world right around the corner! You look great girl, and can we take a moment to appreciate how stinkin cute you are with short hair too! Any hairstyle looks great on you, but your hair is growing back so healthy and beautifully! I'm so happy you kicked cancer's @$$ and are doing so great these days! My heart just melts every video with you guys! And to make sure Eamon doesn't feel left out... I guess he's not too shabby either! Haha!! You two make the best team!! All the love from the US!!
Love you both! I don't comment much, been watching since 2019! I am so happy for you both! ❤
I had sooo much pelvic and hip pain with my baby girl, and my pregnancy pillow SAVED me!! It is obnoxiously big, but it helped my sleep so much!!
It is so wonderful to see how you’ve blossomed along your journey with your love at your side… thank you for taking us with you.. love the cabin life you’ve created.. yum, I love curry ❤😋
Happy to watch your family grow and what you do on your daily journey.  Enjoy your beautiful place!
I just gave birth to my daughter in June.  Advice from one mom to another for cramps flex your foot!  For foot swelling rub upwards to get blood flowing up the leg!
Hey Bec, as far as cramps, you could try Ginger ale, it's got quinine so that will help with the cramps. Such a beautiful time in your lives, enjoy it!
Bec do you like the curls? I think you look great.  Congrats on health, baby and life!
The grass grows rich and green on happy paths...to be continued. Of course, fall is in the air. Hope those seeds get busy and set roots pronto. I loved the curry quick mean. Well done Eamon! Bec, you are adorable and such a lovely moma.
My baby girl is going to be born on October 5th (C-section) I don't have any other choice cause I have placenta previa complete and I have had morning sickness since 10 wks pregnant and the exhaustion in the 3rd trimester has been so much worse then the 1st trimester and we had to move this past week we are still living out of boxes frustration through the roof 😢 and pelvic floor pain as well as round ligament pain and I have a grapefruit sized fibroid in my uterus with her is extremely problematic when she's head down I can't hardly walk yes women are freaking amazing 🤩
Bec mentioned moving?
My Daughter is pregnant 22 weeks with my first grandchild we do ultrasound tomorrow Monday afternoon we’re we will finally know the gender very excited 🎉❤😊… Any guesses!!????? Doing a gender reveal and posting it on YouTube. Love you guys you rock BEC ….
What's this about moving to Toronto?
LOL Love this! My first child is now in his 30s but oh, like you Bec, I LOVED being pregnant!! I remember, when he was 7 days over due, I'd lay on my back and watch (AND FEEL) him roll over in my belly. There was very little room in there and you could see the entire movement! We did not have cameras then like you guys have now, but oh how I WISH I had THAT on film...along with the time he pushed his hand against my belly from the inside and I could count his fingers by looking at them!!  Enjoy these moments Bec! After the birth I had such separation anxiety I had trouble leaving him at home with Dad to run to the market. Emon? Have one of those precious cameras of yours within reach when just laying next to mom watching the beauty of this process. Love you both so much and wishing you all the joys that come with giving life. It IS, after all, the BEST part of life. PS...I am (was) built similar to you Bec and I had the pain from my hips spreading. It's the bones softening and making room for the baby/birth. They eventually stop but sadly do not return to their previous position.)
Been watching since I had my first over 4 years ago and I needed a little taste of travel while I settled into motherhood and it's amazing to be allowed into your motherhood journey
So glad to see you’re doing well! 🥰 A tip for the leg cramps (and I suffered with them-still do at 65). The recommendation from my OB was to take some form of calcium carbonate at bedtime (I chose tums). Worked like magic and still does. Apparently during PG, the baby is taking calcium to make her own bones and when you become deficient, the first place you suffer is in your muscles, hence the leg cramps.  Also about Oso’s rock eating- please break him of this habit! A close friend’s lab used to do this. He had several surgeries to remove the rocks but he eventually died from it. I don’t know how you’ll train him but he seems to obey you guys on just about everything else, I guess be vigilant! You guys are great pup parents 🙌🏼
The cooking segment was everything 😂
That baby bump looks beautiful on you, Bec! 🥰
Can't wait to see baby Bob!
Your stepping stones are pretty far apart- they fit nicely together with about a 4-6” gap for grass, but I doubt you’ll have time to redo it for a few years.
You two are so fun and I love your editing. Always so happy to see your videos on the weekend. Thank you so much !
My daughter is 23 weeks, she has been EXHAUSTED with this one...2nd boy tho WOOOHOOO the hubby and I had 4 girls lol
You guys never fail to see the positive in life and get through some of the deepest most difficult dark hurdles when you share them all with us. You’re going to be such a wonderful doting loving parents I can’t wait to see your little princess.❤
We love you guys! From San Diego, Ca!
I am currently 23 weeks pregnant with our first baby! We’re having a boy. I’ve been feeling him move more and more lately which is such an unusual and cool feeling. I have been having some hip and lower back pain and trouble sleeping too, so I can relate to how you’re feeling! Hate to complain about feeling so tired and painful sometimes, but also grateful to be able to experience every moment of pregnancy ❤ Wishing y’all the best and look forward to watching your family grow!
Thank God for this blessing.Congratulations to you both ❤
Reminds me of the Bible story of Job. All that he lost, yet he’d not curse the Lord our GOD. GOD blessed him with an abundance. For all you two have been through, GOD knew exactly what to bless you guys with for happiness the rest of your lives. 🥰🙏. Though we never fully understand His purpose , TRUST HIM ALWAYS.  SOMETIMES the stronger things are made weak and the weaker things be made strong. HE also wouldn’t put you through more than you could bare. 🙏.  You two rock. Love ya to pieces. ♥️
You are looking great. The path is fabulous.
Pregnancy brain- I left my car door open while I went on a hike, it was open when I got back 😅
Oh so sweet! I’m 21 weeks, big emotional journey, loads of psychological shifts. More than physical. Feels like big inner work is happening before arrival ♥️
SOY IS SO BAD FOR YOU
So happy for you two, I love how 360 everything has come. Love the progress updates. 😁 also I'm surprised they (Professional) did not also mention magnesium for the leg cramps. OMG I had leg cramps in my legs and feet, middle of the night attacks. Hated those. Many ways to add magnesium to your diet, but you could try just adding molasses to thing like shakes or oats, there is unsweetened if you don't want the extra sugar. I liked the sweet and that was the sugar. One Tbsp a day keeps those cramps away 😊 and now fall is here there is Cinnamon Reason muffins you can make with it, yum! Hope this helped.
I heard about this channel through Trent and Allie’s You Tube channel. They were asking people to pray for you when you heard the cancer diagnosis. I’m so glad I started following your channel. So happy that it has led you to this part of your life and having a child. You two are adorable! ❤
I've been watching your videos for so many years, loved all the travel life vlogs and cabin renos and everything in between. Love watching you guys become parents, lots of love from Finland! ❤
That baby bump is too adorable. 🥰
You two are adorable.
Stop doing the work of your electric toothbrush. Don't scrub like a traditional toothbrush. And, support your hips (reduce pressure) with a pillow under hips or between legs (if side sleeper).
You guys make my Sunday morning
Am I the only one who caught Bec saying they’re moving to Toronto??!!!
I'm 18 weeks and 2 days. I'm due February 23rd. It's my second pregnancy. I'm having a lot of braxton hicks and lightning crotch pain, which is way sooner than I had with my first. I am grateful to be pregnant, but man is pregnancy hard. I absolutely hate it as my main symptom is constant nausea and I'm vomiting at least 4 times a day. Still it is much better than my first, where I was vomiting every day until I gave birth about 8 to 10 times a day. I still have scars in my throat from vomiting this much, which have becoming worse now that I'm vomiting a lot all over again.
Next time make a “chef” counter.
Eamon does it all!!! Cooks, yard work, mason man , builder, etc. etc. You are a lucky gal!
Seed man, i saw this video demonitzed so quickly xD
You look greart Bec finaly a beautiful baby is coming! I love you an admire you! Proud of bode of u ☺️💕
I lub u guys
After raising 4 successful humans, I will tell you a little secret...don't try to change the environment for the baby...don't try to be quiet, don't think that they won't sleep when they need to, noise or no. My hubby played a lot of softball, and we had our son field side at the games while I kept score at 1 week old...slept right through the noise and excitement. Had kids that I babysat, plus our oldest running through the house, not being quiet, and they slept right through it. It's when you keep everything quiet around them that they will startle awake so easily. Makes for an easier life when you don't have to worry about background noise in different locations disturbing baby girl, especially since you enjoy travel.
So proud of you Bec. You’ve been through a lot this past 2 years. Congrats on the baby and I can’t wait to see you guys become parents. ❤
Another entertaining and hilarious video. I just cracked up laughing when you, Bec were talking about how your one day project has turned into more then one day.😂 The exhaustion on your face was priceless. I think baby girl is going to have a sweet tooth just like her daddy. The best is yet to come.
Friendly advice. Put up a net in the car for the saftey fir both the dog and you in case of an accident so he dont fly over the seats . Both you and the dog can get really hurt.
best video ever!    cheerrs till next time my friends
Honey's like a natural medicine
Guess what?!   We're in Toronto!   Hope I see you when out & about!   : ) : ) : )
Our dog had a booster seat next to the baby. 😂 I just love Oso. Quinine(tonic water) is supposed to help with leg cramps. I don’t know if it works because I hate the taste.
First off I wanna say thanks Bec for being such an inspiration. I'm currently battling breast cancer an I lost my Son in 2020 an it's been so hard an Bec thank you for the strength an all the laughs. You both rock an baby girl is so blessed to have you both as parents. Bec when I was pregnant I had bad hip pain, I started putting a pillow between my knees when I slept and it made a huge difference. Wishing you two all the blessings life holds.
I have laffed, cried, worried, been surprised  and excited throughout yalls journey! Bec you look absolutely gorgeous pregnant! Bec on the tractor was so cute! Walkway looks great! Eamon thank you for noticing what a woman's body goes thru during pregnancy! Sending love and light to all of you! See you next Sunday! 🎉🩷🩷🩷🦋
You can get in YOUR Hot tub as long as it isn’t to hot
how does he get all those shots???
I look forward to Sunday mornings where I roll out of bed and watch your newest episode. I also love to see my man on the tractor around our property haha. I wonder what that’s about 😂
3:18 - you CAN blame pregnancy brain for everything, LOL.  And spoiler alert...it doesn't fully go away after the baby arrives, LOL!! 😂😅
they have rear dog fence for cars
You have built a little paradise there.     I hope you don’t get so normalized to it that you forget how special it is.
Hi Bec, I am 22 years, 1 month, 11 days postpartum since the birth of my 5th son.  A son who was an absolute miracle after I had been on low dose chemo for almost 7 years to treat RA.  I was 40 years old.  He is an amazing young man…all of my sons are.  I can tell you with absolute certainty that the wonderful feelings associated with motherhood only get stronger and better each passing day. 😊 Blessing to you and Eamon.  ❤
I love u guys I hate that YouTube tv doesn’t allow the love that we want to give I hope all  goes well and everything goes smoothly we love and wish nothing but the best for you ❤
I family I knew had a German Shepherd that loved very large rocks and would find them and bring them home from who knows where (they lived in a wooded area too). Was ruining his teeth.
As someone who just binged The Bear, I was dying with all the "chef" talk.
OMG YES! Why do they do that, are they lacking some minerals? Idk. But it drives me crazy 😊
It is YOU GUYS who makes our lives special! I just told about your vlog to my friend (we are from Hungary) who is going through some rough time (second time breast cancer) and that how much I learnt from you. Thank you!
Great! ❤
I love this vlog! Currently pregnant with my first at 36 y/o and due around the end of Jan/beginning of Feb! Loving watching Bec’s pregnancy journey while I attempt to also document mine. Keep these vlogs coming! Sending all the fun, pleasurable, and empowering pregnancy vibes to you guys!
When I was Pregent I craved Taco Bell.
Awesome video, blessings to you and your journey to motherhood ❤️ we all look forward and seeing you and hobby as wonderful parents 🎉.
Love you guys so much❣️ wishing you all the blessings and love 💕 🤗🥰☀️
Bec you look so cute pregnant . I am so happy for you both . Oso is like your child dog  ,,,, lol . He listens sometimes then doesn't ...lol .. Love the new walkway .
give yourself lots of grace.  pregnancy and labor and birth are a whole other thing to recover from.
Have you considered planting Lavender between your pavers? There ia a low height growing variety that will tollerate pathways, smells nice and great for your feet. Just another option, but it is your domain not mine. Congrates on the growth of your little one, I didn't have that much movement so I'm jelly. Hugs.
Nothing better than a cup of Habit Organic Breakfast and a new video from you 3 2/3!  Hello from this Colorado grandmother!
Pretty pathway ❤
You both deserve all the happiness in the world!
I loved this video, I love you guys! I wish you so many blessings with life and with baby girl ❤😊
Congratulations to the two of you.. You’re world is about to change indefinitely.. You will be shocked by the internal love that you will embark on 😊 Again relish and savior every moment ❤❤
Hope you guys can give us a Ceritas Beach Dog shelter update sometime soon!!
Hey beautiful Bec! Any updates on name choices? Charlie is a cute girls name! Just sayin. Sending good vibes your way 💓
Sooo happy for you🥰 you are such a beautiful pregnant mama! I started following you guys when I saw Bec going through her cancer journey and I admired you so much for everything you've been through  and watching you come through the other side is beyond beautiful 💞💞 i lost my father to cancer and he was only 49 years old and i had to watch the strongest man i ever knew fall apart so seeing someone break through that pain/sorrow makes my heart feel more full❤️ so thank you! Dont stop sharing both your stories!
Awe look at that bump!!! The oil is good! I used vitamin E, it works really well too! I had to have a C-section and thanks to vit E I don't even have a scar! I loved the wild ride of cravings when i was preggo!  It was so bizarre. I had to have hot wings every. single. day. for the entire pregnancy! Along with that I went from dying for choc & pb milk shake to having to have a (virgin) spicy bloody mary depending on the day. My poor husband lol kept him on his toes.
You guys are 6 months pregnant, but it's only 2 months for us. I can't believe how far long you guys are!! We would have loved to have been on the entire journey with your pregnancy, but we understand why you did not let us know in the beginning. We are so excited for you guys!!
The deer peeing to the smoothie scene, nice. 🤣
Yay! I’m almost 20 weeks! I’ve had really bad morning sickness, almost down 10 pounds (but baby is thriving). Haven’t had the the second trimester boost of energy but I’m hopeful!
I think you will be surprised how much your dog will take on the babysitter role, not even treats will distract him from his baby 😊
So happy for you both ❤ you both are gonna be amazing parents
Great work on the walkway!!
Love watching your videos, what a journey! Thanks for sharing so much of your life with us online! Also Oso is the best 😂❤
You cooking dinner was like a scene straight out of "The Bear". Looked delicious!
My DIL is expecting early December. Her first baby and my first grand!  I put an app. on my phone to follow her pregnancy. She’s 29 weeks also with a baby girl!  Also, another similarity is that I’m a breast cancer survivor too!  💪🏼 It’s wonderful to watch you enjoying every moment of your pregnancy.  ❤
Did I miss the move info? When do you move?  Do you have a place there already?  Just for the winter?
I had my baby girl 6 weeks ago, after 10 years of trying and I miss being pregnant a lot, but I traded it for a sweet little angel. There is such a special sweetness in being able to participate in creating a whole new person.  Never felt more connected to nature.  Love the fact, that you are letting us join  this amazing adventure with you. This little girl is a lucky one! You both will be amazing parents ❤❤❤❤
Our dog eats rocks 🤣His name is Roca (rock in Spanish), little did we know that he'd live up to his name literally😂. Looking forward to winter and snow, all the rocks are hiding under the snow. Thanks for another great video. All the best for the upcoming weeks of expecting Your precious Honey
Make sure you drink a lot of water. East a banana too. 💗  I can’t wait to see what name you’ve come up with! I drove myself crazy naming my 2 adopted daughters! We chose Maeve & Madeline. We discovered Madeline, Madelyn, Madison… are very popular right now. Now that she’s in high school, she goes by Mads and not Maddy. This made things easier for her teacher. Eamon… you are hilarious! The deer peeing, and you slurping made me belly laugh!  🎉
You look so adorable Bec!!!
It was beautiful to see Lee pop in for a wee visit to remind you she's with y'all 🌻
surely you are going to the hospital to have that baby
Eamon, when baby girl is born you will see exactly how amazing women are!!!
I’ve been watching you guys since 2018 and I am so happy to finally see you guys on this journey!! I just had my son 2 weeks ago 🥹 💞 you guys.
❤ A follower from Mexico!! Yesterday was my bday 😊
Watched with my babygirl (she's 5, hardly a baby anymore 🥹) during our Sunday spa time on this chilly rainy fall day! So happy for you and your little family! Much love from your upstate NY neighbors ❤❤
It’s always to a big treat to watch your vlogs. And this one is also just marvelous 😍 I can’t wait to see the next one. And again I so glad you are again able to produce more often videos 🙏🏻❤️  Love you guys   ❤
We love you guys! So glad you are doing so well!😊
Get your sleep now because the first few months with a newborn screws up your biorhythm and sleep.
oh wow noone has ever done that before
Beautiful
I absolutely adore you guys. Your vlogs are literally the one I look forward to. I watch probably 8 other vloggers but nobody beats you guys. I love how raw, real and genuine you are.
What a difference one year makes 🙌 Bec, you're absolutely GLOWING! 😍 Are you guys running the CIBC run for the Cure again this year? I wish every woman had as supportive of a husband as you have in Eamon ♥️ Cannot wait to see what the next year has in store for y'all 🙏
Bec, Eamon and you are beautiful people I have loved watching you guys for the last 3 years through the cancer ,the travels and now the child on the way!  Keep the faith!!! Love you both!😅😅😅😅❤❤❤❤
We’re so proud of you both! Bec, you’re glowing 🩷and you look amazing!!! Nothing Eamon cannot do👍🏻 Big hugs to Oso🩵
It’s lovely to see how life moves on. I’m feeling a bit stuck after chemo and dealing with the emotional trauma but you guys always inspire me.
Watching from northern BC! I love watching you guys work on your cabin. We also live in the woods on a lake and we’re slowly renovating and adding to our outdoor space, your place is such an inspiration! I’m also so excited to follow on your pregnancy journey, love you both! ❤
Always ONLY move a turtle to the direction they were already heading or else they'll just turn around and you harmed them more. Also you should have gloves on otherwise wash and sanitize immediately afterwards
Bec, when you have the leg cramps at night, eat a banana. I promise it will make them stop, instantly. It's your body being depleted of and craving potassium. I had these cramps when I was pregnant as well, and bananas make them stop, instantly.
@Armonandbec You and eamon are couple goals.. if anyone deserves this yous do. My heart ached for you in your past. I’m not say the c word. Lol but I’m super excited to see yous whe the little sweethearts gets here. And I’ll watch every time u pop a video on.. lots of love from Scotland 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿   Xx
Is it wrong to say I’m nursing a semi from Bec in the bikini? 😂😂😂😂
I love you both so much!!! What a crazy world we live in, to never have met, but we all feel so included in your life. I SOBBED when you posted the listing for Trinity... one chapter closes, and the best is yet to come. :)  I'm a first-time mom to an almost 10-month-old girl, and it's been a wild time! She changes so much every single day... I am so excited for you both to experience this new adventure in your life. It's truly the best feeling in the world—so amazing that you can barely describe it! (And Bec, I had the same pregnancy symptoms... unfortunately, the sweet cravings and sugar addiction continued well past Sadie's due date LOL.)
Happy Sunday! If Son actually swallows rocks-  he could end up w a stomach full of them, need surgery to unblock his intestines😲😭
Try seeing an Osteopath in Kingston to help with preg related pain. Clarisse M could help you out
You two Absolutely rock!!! ❤❤❤
how to get rid of the  dialog in black that blocks the picture?  i don" like it
You've gone pop 🎉! Beautiful!
It sounds like the pregnancy's going so well, I'm really pleased for you. I must have missed a video - are you moving permanently to Toronto? And selling the cabin? Your cabin is my dream home and location but my son is now a teenager and it's slightly different when you have a newborn and toddler. It's sometimes easier to be around baby/toddler groups and other mums which a city will give you. Looking forward to following your journey!
Your moving to Toronto???? Are you still keeping the cabin? You've got to keep the cabin!! IT'S So Amazing 🤩 Eamon and Bec you both are so Damn cute the way you are changing with Baby Girl coming and Bec you look so dang good with your little baby bump🥰  please tell me your not selling the cabin🙏 Blessings and Love to you All, see you Sunday 🙏♥️🙏♥️🙏
Girl, God has a funny sense of humor! When we think no he says sure go ahead! I’m so happy for y’all!!! ❤ He will never put more on you than you can bare always remember that!
Bec you are the epitome of resilience. You have come so far in just one year. ❤❤❤   Random tmi question but will your right breast always be smaller? Will the tissue never grow back?
Been following along on your journey since the vanlife in Europe days and just reflecting on how much I enjoy everywhere your journey takes you! Whether it's vanlife, cabin life, your recovery journey or starting your new family, I am grateful for the little bit of peace that you bring every Sunday in sharing it with all of us 🤍 so thank you! All the best for you guys and baby girl 🤍 xxx
I love seeing you guys on this new journey of expanding your family and settling down! I have followed your journey for years, and you have actually inspired me to build my own van! It's currently in the works. I was wondering if you guys could give an updated list of your favorite van life destinations now that you guys have hung up the keys? Much love and best wishes!
Los Angeles, I love Sundays. I normally use it to slow down and reboot. (Sundays are the beginning of the week for me, so by Monday I have a more positive mindset.) At the moment I'm getting ready to go to the gym. It's 9am here.
Hahah wow such a funny and wholesome episode! The straw sound and the deer got me so good 😂🙌
You look great Bec - LOVE your hair and baby bump.  You are so lucky to have a partner like Eamon. Did I miss the  video where you are moving to Toronto?  Is Toronto going to be your permanent residence?
You could get a doggie seatbelt and then Oso can sit next to the baby!  (We did :) )
❤ that little intro! 💪🏼 We’re 4.5 months pregnant with baby no.2 ❤
Beautiful pictures its look a little bit of our country Sweden autumn 🍁🍂 love   Ozzo ❤
You both are amazing, Bec and Eamon! ❤
You guys are awesome, big hugs, happy Sunday!😊
The muffling of music at 19:20 to coincide with Emon and camera being underwater was such a brilliant edit!!!
Bec you look absolutely amazing. That baby bump is so cute... .and Eamon awesome as always... love how sweet and crazy Osso is. Reminds me.of my pup especially at the end biting Eamons toes...  path is looking great.
Osso is smarter then that. He might sit beside your baby girl to protect her but never to sit on her. Just watch and see
Thank you for sharing your videos.
I have a mastiff. He eats rocks too
INCREDIBLE CONTENT 💕 what a life y’all live, thanks for sharing it
I have to say the two of you soon to be three of you sure do pack a lot of life in your days.
Loved this video and seeing the growing baby bump and your awesome projects at the cabin. Just love you guys!
is the cabin staying under your guys ownership while in Toronto? I hope its not expensive! It'd make a nice vacation spot to run to
13 weeks along with our little miracle baby. Watching your journey inspired me so much throughout our process of trying to conceive! ❤
I am 22 weeks and mostly feeling amazing, incredibly grateful to be here and feeling her move almost constantly at this point! Sleep's definitely getting difficult though lol
I legit cant miss a baby update! Bec looks Soo cute pregnant ❤ rooting for you guys everyday an praying for a healthy baby girl 🎉
We use Manuka honey for all manners of ills in treating our pets as well as humans. You. An use locally sourced honey as well, the darker in color the better. Hint: Its really not good to place any metal utensil into your honey which is why you are bamboo tools for dipping into your jar. It neutralizes the healing properties of the honey.
Bec you are so strong dont ever give up you been through a LOT! You're a tropper❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ love from canada
Bec looks wonderful. Nice job with new pathway. Very sad that your moving away from cottage.😢
Bec will never know what hair changes are due to chemo vs pregnancy... until baby two I guess? Wild that it all happened so close together!
After a certain age you will shorten the honey to hun!  😂
Oh, the joys of mommy hood, Bec your one strong woman and so very lucky to have Eamon, baby girl is the luckiest of all, she's got great parents ❤
Bec, I'm a pelvic health physical therapist in Tennessee, USA and your pregnancy pain is what we specialize in. I think in Canada, search for pelvic health physio around you and find a PT that specializes in this and can help you!  Hope this helps!
Eamon needs to stand on the other side of Bec (deck scene after swimming) not to block the sunlight on Bec! No blocking momma! Ha.
Bec you look amazing To watch your journey this past year from breast cancer to know being 6 months pregnant n allowing us all along for the ride has been a joy to experience You have a great partner in Eamon Love the part with the dragonfly Whenever i see a rainbow Istill say to Lee now will do for a dragonfly also  she is looking down on her two best friends n smiling n sending you both good vibes
Can you PRETTY PLEASE share a music playlist!?!?! I love the chill vibes.
I'm a newer viewer. I was introduced to them through Kara and Nate.  It's wonderful to see where they are now. ❤
31 weeks pregnant and I'm also sleeping in much later for all the same reasons! We also just built a murphy bed in our soon-to-be nursery! LOVE watching your journey, thank you for sharing!
I think that triple the number of stones would have been better. Those large gaps between the stones are a risk for sprained ankles.
Bec, I thought you were beautiful before but you are more beautiful now. Love you and ‘Eamon so much.
It’s been lovely watching your journey. Your videos make me smile from beginning to end. ❤
You are so inspiring! I remember when YouTube told me your video could be interesting for me. We transformed since then… Your adventures with Trinity showed me, what I didn’t, because of being single. And then you bought the cabin and you showed me, what I can do by myself. Before I always complained that I couldn’t do it. With your inspiration I just did it. 😁 Thank you! Also for refreshing my pregnancy memories 20 years ago. Wish you all the best! Many greetings from VIENNA! ❤
I’m 19 now and when I first started to watch your videos I was just 12. It’s crazy and beautiful seeing you guys grow in love throughout all these years as I grow up. You guys inspire me to follow my dreams, you guys impacted me so much that since 2017 til this day I click on YouTube just to check on how you guys are doing ❤ You guys are so freaking amazing, i am so grateful for being able to keep up with you guys after all this time and see you guys prosper in joy, is all I ever wanted for you guys. You guys are just hands down amazing. Stay true to your guy’s self as always 🫶🏽   - Sincerely, w/love Yesi (2017)
This is such a wholesome vlog.
Looking so good Bec.! The walk way looks good to. So happy for you both. My Daughter is due in Nov.  and she is having a girl. Big hugs!!
“No paparazzi!” is what we always say to narrate our dog. She hates having her picture or video taken 😆
Well Bec, I’m not pregnant, but when I was able, I suffered 5 pregnancy loss’ but my niece had a baby just this past February and I was present for the birth. Such an exciting miracle I got to experience with her. I will say you look fabulous and I can wait to see y’all’s future ❤I also just love that cabin, man I would love to have such a beautiful place and view.
So many comments; to keep cilantro fresh for weeks when you get home, cut 2/3 inches off the stems Place it in an inch of water in a dish and cover it with a light vegetable bag and change the water periodically the cilantro will last forever. 🪴
Just get a doggie net for the rear compartment,  dog can see and get fresh air.
Aww my parents have same tractor and I taught my girls how to move sand. They were 6 and 8 😂 they thought it was so much fun lol
So proud of you Eamon and Bec! Yall are so amazing 🎉
Hi Eamon... yes she can blame pregnancy brain for everything. Those hormone changes be wilden. Anyone who has experienced pregnancy or menopause knows.
Are you gonna give birth in Toronto?
Prego brain is real!  Wait till you can only do 1 thing at a time…no multi tasking
do you know how excited i am when i see a new video from you? i love seeing the pregnancy updates. sending love from saskatoon xx
I’m also 26 weeks. I’m having a girl too. She’s def a tap dancer and keep me in an out of the bathroom lol.
Good morning! My dog ate rocks and swallowed them. And we had to take 6in of her intestines out. Because Iraq was lodged. And after we did that she still went back to eating rocks I think she likes the mineral taste. But it's very dangerous
Bec you are an amazing human and I'm in awe of how you have handled these last few years. You and Eamon inspire me throughout my own physical struggles and brighten my days in the process. I'm so excited y'all have decided to share this new journey with us. Blessed be!
I might have missed something, but are you moving to Toronto? and what about the cabin then :)
Anybody else watch 2x to make sure you didnt miss anything?? 💜 immediately start doing chores when I put these videos on and have to watch a few times to catch the whole thing! 🙌🏼
Love you guys and absolutely adore the bear !!!!❤❤❤❤
I hope this journey will lead you to realize that "There is no one worthy of Worship except The Creator alone" ❤
I always enjoy your videos. 🎉
Yay eamon thank u so much for saving the turtle.   For those who don’t know… when u help a turtle cross the road, make sure u don’t change the direction they’re going in. They will spend their entire lives tryna get back. Turtles spend their entire lives inside a 1-2 mile radius
Hey Eamon, not sure why you would want to drink SOY.. trying to load up on ESTROGEN???🤪🤪
And for leg cramps, you can use a magnesium cream and take your calcium at night.
Bec, after you have her do NOT NOT NOT NOT pick up anything except the baby. You WILL rip the muscles in your lower back and you will be in pain forever. I made that mistake after I had my daughter, she's 33, I am still in pain. So please don't do what I did.
I LOVE YOU GUYS SO MUCH YOU ARE AMAZING❤❤❤❤
Bec u should totally put ur chocolate in the fridge.....its soooo good cold! ur bump is sooo cute!!!
Salt water tubs are ok.
We're those tomatoes or oranges in the bowl in the table?! My gosh, they look amazing!!! Lol Bec you have no idea the amount of love and admiration I have for you! You have shown me so much over the last 3 years! I feel like I'm connected to you all the way from Alberta! ❤❤
For your sore back: use six or eight tennis balls, put them on a yoga mat on top of a sweatshirt and roll your back on them. The sweat shirt helps keep them from rolling away.  Yes dogs ruin interior leather, he belongs in the way back 100%.  Perfect choice with the natural shape pavers! That was a perfect pose when Eamon yelled at Oso and missed the shot! Ha so glad your documenting it you’ll be glad years from now you did! 🫶🏻🤰🏻 you look amazing pregnant! 💓
So great to see you growing and glowing
Been around since 2020 watching from El Salvador and being a silent watcher for most times except on the harder times and the happiest times like this one. You are an inspiration Bec, such a strong woman! Eamon has been amazing throughout these times, so proud of you guys!
I was once told cramping at night comes from not having enough mustard in your diet.   I have no idea how you are going to work mustard into your diet????  So, I worked in a few meals where mustard was the condiment of choice.  Low and behold, the cramps stopped.  Oh, another one I learned, if you get the hiccups really bad, eat a teaspoon of sugar, and they'll stop.  I tired that and it worked too.   So, I was thinking, is there anything you can eat to help with ED?  Oysters, right?  I couldn't think of a funny one liner for that one.  Maybe someone out in comment land can help me with that one.  Got to be some kind of food you could say will help with ED that is hilariously funny?  How about bread STICKS, or maybe cinnamon STICKS, you get the idea, right.    Anyway, loved the video.  You two are just wonderful together.  So funny!!  Take care, love yuh, mean it!!
🇿🇦♥️♥️
Who is Jerry?
You are looking GREAT 😇🙏💙
06:02 Congrats on your pregnancy ... may I just offer one kindly meant piece of advice that relates to your furbaby? Our Chow Chow Leo was "all teeth" when it came to taking treats and when our own little boy came along I taught him "nice nice" by removing the treat until he used soft lips to take it (our boy, Max, his brother-chow has soft lips for treats). I've noticed Oso is sooo good about waiting to go to his food that I have no doubt he'll catch on being a bit more careful in taking treats. To add a bit of a visual, Leo learned how to use his lips instead of an open mouth (and all those sharp teeth) by me saying, "Nice ... nice ... " while slowly bringing the treats to his lips (picture or horse eating a carrot here). It took some time but your new little lady will be grateful, and Oso, too, as they grow up together. Oh my! Oso is going to be such a good big-brother! ❤😊
My 2 girls are now 13 & 9, but I remember the calf cramps in the middle of the night while I was pregnant with them! I found it helped to not point my toes while stretching, as that could create a knot in the muscle. Best wishes from not far away in Gatineau, QC 😊
Aahw look at that tummy. Finally showing❤❤❤
I must have missed something because I thought I heard you say your moving to Toranto!!!!!  What did I miss?????
I'm so glad you guys posted. I absolutely do not miss a video and really look forward to it. I really love your videos. I love you guys and I wish you all the best!!❤
I laughed numerous times during this video. Every Sunday I look forward to your updates and progress at the cabin. Even these simple day in the life videos really show the great communication and love between you two. See you next Sunday! 😊
Hey Eamon where did you get the netting in your ceiling ?  Dumb ? I know
Your babes bump is so cute!! Stoked for your both. Thank you for sharing your lovely life with all of us!
Aw bec the the kicks are the best aren't they! I'm 31 weeks today!! Eamon everything is to blame on pregnancy brain. I've told everyone I'm a circuit short lol my pregnancy is high risk because I'm diabetic and plus size I'm having a little boy he's my little 🌈 even what a joyful and scary time it is.
I am so excited for you both. It’s so special to see the love you two have for each other. This little girl is going to be such a blessing to your life and what a privilege it will be to add her to your family!  If anyone deserves the joy of parenting it’s you guys. Especially after all you have been through. Your both gonna be great parents and I can’t wait to see which traits she takes for each of you!  God bless you both and thank God for your little angel coming soon!!!❤
Looking so good ! I am now 26 weeks and my god I have now popped. The nights are hard because of like the werid glute cramps, back is now real. Towards end of the day I just feel like a whale! Most of my clothes also now don’t fit 😩 honestly the struggle is now getting real! Best of luck :) I am also have a girl ❤
Why are you moving
1:15 you’re not done morphing yet. First it’s Sweets, and sleeping in, next you’ll be wearing Eamen’s underwear (for support).
It’s so relaxing watching both you and Eamon work as a team and “feather your nest”. You’ve come such a long way Bec and never forget how far those aching bones have brought you so far. You’re a real inspiration for so many women x
Hey Bec! I'm currently 41+4 and currently experiencing contractions as I watch your video! I would also say to oil your hips too. I religiously oiled my bump but left my hips and have only ended up getting stretch marks there. You're thriving during your pregnancy and love watching your experiences, which allows me to look back on my experiences over the last 9 1/2 months.
Watching from LA and dont have any kids but I teach 150 middle schoolers that think im their mother. Sending hugs and love youre way and enjoy all the sweets
Do not allow to your dog to eat stones. Basically it could kill your dog. Better to check with the vet. Sometimes stones can cause a blockage, and simply will kill your dog.
Should have planted clover or chammomile, low growing don't need mowing!
Becc you are looking absolutely radiant!
Our first dog ate rocks. We used to joke that we were going to take her to a quarry for her birthday 😂😂
Did I miss something? Why on earth would anyone leave that beautiful cabin life and move to the city? Especially after putting so much work into it? Hopefully when the baby comes there will be more stability, that they'll decide on a home and stay for awhile. I'm really big on traveling; however, once my now adult child was born, stability for HIM was super important. Travel and spontaneity changed, as it should and must.
So happy for you guys! Enjoy every moment 💗 I'm so jealous of your beautiful cabin. It looks so peaceful!
Bec  you are so beautiful pregnant!  You and Emon are so deserving of all this joy.  Have you talked to your cancer Dr. about soy?  One of my dearest friends is a breast cancer survivor and her cancer Dr. instructed her to avoid all types of soy.  Just an fyi.  This was a great video.
No profound message here, just . . . You guys make me smile . . . A lot! ❤️
❤❤❤
She definitely can blame it for everything Eamon. 😂😅😂
6 MONTHS?! IT FELT LIKE YESTERDAY U ANNOUNCED THE BABY. OMG ❤❤
Today is my dads birthday who passed away last year after a battle with cancer. Your video was just what I needed to lift me up a little on a tough day 💛 sending your little family lots of love!
ye look fabulous bec. man, eamon cracks me up. he is waaay bigger than a party in a box. and together you guys are more than amazing. ye absolutely rock life! i imagine your baby girl is gonna be a super exceptional human being. thanks for sharing. continue to enjoy it all... and continued travels mercies and blessings. 🕊
BACK WHERE THE BOOTY MEETS THE LEGS..PRIME STRETCH MARK AREA😊
Sending the 4 of you much ❤
I'm 7-ish weeks with baby #2! I'm exhausted and nauseous but I'm able to push through better than last time because life with a 3-year-old doesn't stop!
Good morning 🥰 loved seeing youre bump grow! Really makes me missing my baby bump.  magnesium will help you with the cramping! Take a magnesium pillen before you go to sleep. Or put magnesium oil on youre legs! It does wonders.   Love you guys❤❤
My baby just turned 5 moths old! It’s such an amazing journey! You two are going to love it and do great! It’s definitely scary (especially when you’ve been sick before with any kind of illness, my husband has had a disease for years now with no cure,) but it’s so 100% worth it! You’re a beautiful woman who is going to have a beautiful baby! As for me, I had a really easy pregnancy. Personally I found it really enjoyable. I’m so excited for you both!! 🎉❤
Hi Bec! Love that I can experience pregnancy with you!!! I look forward to every Sunday so I can watch your vlogs in bed. I’m 23 weeks tomorrow and my anxiety and hormones are all over the place. I feel lonely even though I have a great support system from my family and partner. I feel disconnected from my friends who don’t have children. It’s hard to talk to them or relate to what they like to do right now. Not sure if I should talk to them or bother them about it. They haven’t really asked how I’ve been doing either so it’s hard to express it.
currently 22.5 weeks pregnant 🤍 so amazing getting to follow along on this journey with you , with being not that far behind ! Have watched you both for years and just beyond excited for both of you ! 🫶🏼
Cutest bump ever❤
2:55 No pictures pleases 😂🎉
It's not true.  Oso will not sit, stand, lay on, or anything similar to the baby.  He will instictively know better.  As a matter of fact, 9 times out of 10 a dog like Oso will become the babies and the mothers protector.  Very rarely do they not understand what the baby is to you.
My fire alarm goes off sometimes when I cook 😂. My fire alarm has a silent button 😂. My dog hates it when it goes off she will howl lol😅
Omg the deer😂😂😂
I love seeing your journey!
Bec, your body has been through so much change in the past few years!! It's really admirable the way you have taken the change in stride. I know its been hard on you both, but you both are such strong and beautiful souls! The human body is amazing!!! I love seeing how good of partners you are to one another, and I can't wait to see you guys as parents. Baby girl is lucky <3
You are both Kenough 😄
Your crazy for not getting a pick up truck just saying to each there own
OMG Eamon's super-girly scream when he picked up the turtle! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 Bec, you look radiant! 💛
great video keep up the good work!
Watching from the Netherlands, unfortunately. I've been in isolation for over two years after they took our only home (on wheels) and life took our girl. There's but a few things to look forward to for those past few years and one of them is your videos - they've honestly been one of very few reasons to keep on living.
Hola!!!! So happy for you guys!! Watching from Denver (no more vanlife for now) if you ever come to Denver let us know. Los queremos 😘😘
Holllyyyy shit it’s been 6 months already ?!
i am genuinely so happy for you guys!!! with how much older i've gotten i've realized how AMAZING mothers are, when my mom was pregnant with me, she went into septic shock and she suffered a lot. and knowing thats its really eye opening to realize mothers go through a lot for their babies. now my mother is fighting breast cancer, and now im trying my best to inspire and support her to fight just like how shes inspired and supported me throughout my life
And your ribs move too!  Your Bronco is TnA! Perfect for your needs there! And thank you for supporting American vehicles! 🇺🇸🇨🇦🙌🏻neighbors! 🫶🏻
Eamon at (7:35): “THE KEY IS TO USE THE HOT OATS ON THE COLD BERRIES— **SNEEZE** 😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣 🫐🫐🫐🫐🤧🤧🤧🤧
you two are gonna make amazing parents
Currently 21 weeks with my double rainbow baby after a two back to back miscarriages in a year. In the last few weeks, I have finally just started enjoying pregnancy and feeling connected to baby. Nesting has started. It’s been a hard wild ride to get to this point but I am so excited!
Move to Toronto??????
I have noticed that therebis a ton of people  that are due around same time.  Itbis weird!!
End of week 25 here! We are having somewhat of a rainbow baby, as we didnt think it would ve possible to get pregnant again, with both my hyper-thyroidism, pcos and my age. (Im 41). We are very happy about it, but also scared as it puts me in a triple risk situation. Feeling ok, for the circumstances. I have had all of the things, it feels like, but it ebbs and flows and Im getting through it by focusing on the outcome. So excited for you and aemon! Its tough at times, and its ok to say it out loud. You are still a huge inspiration with what you have been through, and your prevailing attitude. That goes for both of you!
Watching from Kingston! I am doing my Masters at Queen's and catch the bus near KGH. I think of you everyday and am so glad things are looking up for you, Bec <3 Can't wait to meet the little one!!
My babies are now 27 and 12.
Bec driving and Eamon riding on the back of the tractor made me laugh out loud!  You guys are so fun!  We are going to miss the cabin so much when you go to Toronto, but looking forward to your new adventures there.  Love coming at ya from the state of Virginia!
Lee 💜
m sooo happy for you Bec❤️❤️❤️
I’ve watched you forever! Love your videos. I’m currently 39 weeks with a little girl too. I’m having her on Friday and can’t wait. The bladder situation gets worse 🤣 I’m so excited to not be pregnant so I don’t get up 1 million times a night to pee 😂 xxx
Why are you moving to Ontario?  And for how long ?
I smiled through this WHOLE episode. You might just be our "better help"!
Love you guys, you look so well becks, well you all do 😊❤❤
Heyo, I've currently got a 2 yr old. But we also have 2 dogs 😅. I'd highly recommend getting oso used to baby things now ie strollers, highchairs, loud noises and someone poking his eyes, ears and tail grabbing....Definitely happens ....alot. and a pre scheduled dog walker for the first couple months was a lifesaver.
Water women and seed man yall are the greatest!! Love watching your videos!! I look forward to it every Sunday❤ have a great week!!
I vomited Every Day I was pregnant starting about 1 week after sex! I vomited on the way to the hospital to give birth. That said, I was incredibly healthy the entire 10 months. Yep, I carried all 3 of my boys 10 months, my mother carried that long too. I had no pain at all and even labor was so easy, I missed it, & the Doc had to tell me I was 6cm dilated, get to the hospital! I Loved being pregnant and am wishing you a smooth next 3 months and an easy delivery girl.
Yeah, even that was a very nice discussion off like that
I’m 17 weeks tomorrow and things are going well so far! I’ve been telling people that it feels like I’m cheating the system since I’m doing so well. I’ve had zero morning sickness except for being a little queasy about some foods and now that I’m in my second trimester all I’ve really noticed is some lower back tightness, not even really pain. I keep waiting for the sh*t to hit the fan, but I’m reveling in the blessings and trying to be grateful for where I am so far!  ETA: this is my first child and a rainbow baby after a chemical pregnancy the cycle before this. It’s been quite a journey to get here!
You two and Oso are just the best!♥
Watching you two is like watching my adult kids. Its just a joy to know every Sunday I get a peek into your lives.  Thank you so much for allowing us in there.  I went through 2 losses before I ended up with two of the most amazing kids. And I love that Eamon doesn't treat you like you're nat able to do anything! Love to both you!
You guys are so strong! Every time I see the notification of you guys dropping a new video make me so excited!
bec, you are an adorable water momma!  Cant wait to see the future for your little family!!
It’s crazy that I struggle with anxiety my whole life but when I’m pregnant it disappears.. it’s so nice to feel normal for these 9 months mentally, one of the only things I love about pregnancy.. I love being able to have babies but being pregnant is not my favorite. The acid reflux for the past month has been a killer.. I’m 39 weeks and beyond ready to not be pregnant anymore!! 😂
Can we clone Eamon? Handy AND cooks fire meals? Couple goals ❤
Yalls videos are always fun, wholesome, humble, and fun
If Bec is becoming more like Eamon the longer she's been pregnant does that mean Eamon has been pregnant this whole time
You guys are moving to Toronto?
Turn the hottub down to just above body temp and jump in!
I am a Mom to a 21  as of yesterday  miracle son who daily makes my day he is always amazing 😻!  My father showed up in penny’s with his death years in a cross pattern I find them everywhere.
WATERWOMAN ROCKS! 🙌🙌🙌🙌  We love you Bec! You're strong and fierce woman and you have been through alot! Such an inspiration is soooo needed in this world! Your daughter and other children will be soooo proud of you! Keep rocking! Or resting your butt, whenever you need it. Up to you! But you'll always be a hero of mine ❤
I know it’s been 6 months, but I’m still in complete shock and joy that you’re having a baby. Love u all❤❤❤❤
Pillow in between the knees for hip pain.
Baby girls take it out of you. And yes, pregnancy brain is to blame for everything, and it doesn't just stop when the baby is born. Like baby cries and we just short circuit until it stops.  Also, I'm diabetic and I am still able to enjoy my home hot tub, just turn down the temperature to 99. I imagine it's the same with pregnancy. I didn't have a hot tub while pregnant, but soaking in my bathtub was the place to be.
Lee makes for a beautiful middle name 😜 but I’m sure anything you pick will be meaningful and special 🤗
You look so cute pregnant
❤❤❤❤
So guys! Any thoughts about maybe using some native ground covers in some areas, rather than grass which is an environmentally damaging application...
I’m 30 weeks 4 days today. My pregnancy has been rough. Lots of ups and downs. Went through 3 miscarriages before making it to this point. I’m incredibly grateful for my baby girl, due November 29. Pregnancy is a big change on the body and there’s so much I’m still learning that pregnant people don’t talk about.
360 from the previous year and literally pregnant 360 days later. I think thats a good sign. Our bodies go through some amazing things. I feel like we dont know how strong we are until we've gotten to the other side. Btw I'm loving Bec's hair and baby bump is soo precious ❤
❤
Eamon and Bec video my Sunday is good now . Bec you're glowing 6 months pregnant wow enjoy the journey 😊
Yikes - wasn't that a snapping turtle? You're lucky it didn't reach around and bite you! You might consider planting some kind of ground cover or curly moss around the pavers so you don't have to mow with a weed wacker.
@eamonandbec found your channel through kinging it and have to say your both amazing people who deserve this baby girl so much she’s the luckiest baby and is going to have the best life with you both can’t wait to watch her grow and wrap eamon round her little finger 😂💞lots of love to you all xxx
Let your vet know that he is eating rocks. It might be a sign of something.
Oh yea, I remember it all!
❤
Love talks vids can't wait to see the new family member.
Did you say you are moving x
What happened with the HUGE deck? Were they able to finish that and get the permits??   Love this video thanks for sharing!! ! ❤❤❤
Ask dr about some stretching and stuff you can do to help with that I’ve have many friends with the pelvic pain best wishes and sending❤ and ☮️
Way to thrive people!!! and isn't The Bear delicious??!!
I’m 18 weeks with my third and i have been permanently hung over all these months lol  it is such a beautiful feeling, though to know that we are creating life within us and a forever bond that no one else can experience but you.. I’m so happy for you Bec, and I continue to pray that you have a healthy, an amazing pregnancy and we cannot wait to meet your beautiful baby girl❤❤❤
I’m almost 29 weeks - also with my first, also baby girl, and third trimester is hitting hard… feeling the same feelings around not being able to stay as awake or energized, but so excited whenever I feel baby girl kick and move. I love all this home improvement and nesting content lately! It’s giving hubby and I some inspiration and energy to do our own improvements before baby gets here.
LOOVE my Sunday mornings with you ❤ Im from Argentina 🇦🇷
Love to see how far you both have come! You bring a smile to my face and constantly remind me of how grateful I am :) Thanks a bunch!
Tofu tip, I tear mine into pieces about the size you cubed, when you tear it whatever spice you put on it has all kinds of nooks to land in,  I do souvlaki tofu a lot, and tearing it is a game changer.
Hello from California!😎💕💕💕
Beca you ready! That belly getting big❤ Oso is hilarious what a smart dog.
@Roaming Reckless…Blue eats 🐕 rocks! 😂 Prayers for Blue on his Cancer journey too! 🙏🏼
I'm 16.5 weeks, and following along while going through this also has been so special. 🤰💕
I had calf cramp.  It is a lack of quinine.   Easy to remedy i was advised to drink a mixer size tonic water a day, not diet and it stopped the cramps.
I don’t usually leave a comment…I guess I felt a bit like no one would read it or would it really matter? One thing I have learned from you both as someone who has watched your journeys for years…you have helped teach me that I do matter. And it doesn’t matter if I don’t live in a van, or a cabin in the woods. I appreciate you both so much and am so thankful for these quiet Sunday mornings and your videos. I’m forever grateful!
So happy for you guys and your wonderfully exciting expanding family. I found your channel through watching your friendship with Kara and Nate on their channel….strangely I was diagnosed with breast cancer, but in my left side, around the same time as you Bec, and I found comfort watching your videos when I was walking through my treatments. I’m delighted to say I too am cancer free now. So happy about that. One of my cousins works as a Consultant in the hospital you went to for treatment, but in the renal department, not oncology. She loves it there. So happy you received great treatment there. May you remain well and happy. Lots of love to you all. Laura watching from Wiltshire, UK xxxx (I’m a Mum of two teenagers btw)
Love you guys ❤
Max is going to crack up when he sees this!
Just remember no honey for baby until after 1 years old. Figured I would say this because when my daughter was little I didn't know.
I can’t wait to watch this with my partner when I get home from work! Sending love from Vancouver Island 🇨🇦💕
That's it, Kara and Nate are next to have a baby :)
You guys are awesome! Love your videos!
Loved this video ! Can’t wait to see the final result. Bec you’re looking amazing as well ❤
God has been so good to you and Eamon.  Pray and thank God.  Daughters are so fun for a woman.  We have more in common with daughters.  But we also butt heads with them as teens.
OMG kiwi chocolate! That was a surprise. Great ep guys. Hugs from the home of Whittakers!
Wait, you're moving? Just for the winter, right?
Praying for a healthy baby. Are you cancer free at this time? I just came across your channel.
Bec can totally blame pregnancy brain on everything 😜
We live in Canada as well! Currently 3 months pregnant with our rainbow baby and very grateful to be feeling so good in this pregnancy. So excited for you guys to welcome in this little one:)
no honey for babies under a year old. thank you
Bec 🤍🤍🤍🙏🏽
I don't even remember when I subscribed but it was back in the van days and I can't even begin to say how happy I am for you guys. I just had twins my first babies 7 months ago! I can't wait for you guys to begin the same journey I just did. I know you'll handle it with so much care grace and love just like you did this last year. Love you guys.
I love your channel ❤️. 🥰👍
That's a really good idea to get these small important projects done now because once your daughter gets here, with the sleep deprivation, you'll be just doing the basic necessities (eat, sleep, bathe, etc) for at least several months until she starts sleeping regularly for 4-6 hour chunks at a time at night.
Eamon just loves his big boy toys ❤
❤I can’t help but smile when I see you both working together. You make an amazing team and you make it feel it fun to work. Keep up the positivity ❤❤❤ Oso  🐕 is king ❤❤
Install a grate in the bronco, found at pet stores and car dealerships.  Helps everyone stay in their own space and prevents 140 pounds of dog come flying toward you if you meet an idiot driver!
We did this stone path too and realized (too late) that it is uncomfortable walking on stones that aren't close enough together.  No biggie.  You might like it fine and if you don't, you can always change it later.
Why is there a little window in the shower
warms my heart watching this video with my 2 dogs on a beautiful Sunday morning 🤍 thanks for sharing
My due date is literally tomorrow! 😅 but I have a feeling it will be longer than that. I am feeling exhausted physically & mentally. Those last few days before birth are just the worst and nobody seems to talk about it. Trying to stay positive ❤
Love following along on your journey as we travel around the world for 6 months! Today we are watching from Ireland :)
If I could recommend one thing and it's nothing to do with baby...Seek out the services of a pelvic floor therapist! You will thank me when you're in your 50's and can't sneeze or cough without dribbling!
Hayy watching from Belgium, I have a 6 months old boy 🥰 I just want to say love you guys, looking forward to every Sunday because of you, watching years. I am just so happy for both of you 💛
I swear when Eamon says “no rocks” to Oso I hear Edna and “no capes”
Gorgeous glowing healthy mama & a very cute pebble eating Oso 😂 Hope you guys have the best week ahead! Thank you for making my week with this vlog😊❤
So proud to see you guys come so far along!!
you are GLOWING ABSOLUTELY STUNNING . so excited for you both on this exciting amazing journey. Many blessings ❤
I just can't believe its been 6 months already!!! This year has been going by TOO fast
Not me, 5 months pregnant, crying when Eamon’s talking about how incredible women’s bodies are and the sacrifices that come with making a little family 😭😭😭😭
From reading this comment section I think eamon and bec need a hole discord for just there followers to talk to eachother. I’ve never been part of a more supportive group
Loved the update❤️❤️ Did I missed sth? Move to Toronto?
Eating rocks?  Does Osso have pika?   Love your life’s journey.  ❤
Someone’s been watching The Bear 😂
Though it feels like it was yesterday (time flies by), I had my only child at 41. I will share with you that "pregnancy brain" is real lol. You will begin to feel normal  within 3 months after delivery❤ Cool tip I was given & pass on, I sang in the shower, & played mellow music while pregnant. When the baby began to cry, I'd sing or play that song. I was shocked but it actually soothed the baby as it was a familiar tune. You two will be fantastic parents ❤
Currently in early labour with our first watching your video at home in our lounge, great timing guys! Aroha nui from New Zealand ❤
I love that Lee finds ways to let you know she’s still with you ❤
You two are so freaking adorable. Idk how you could ever want to leave the cabin. It's so peaceful and beautiful there. Beautiful baby belly Bec. Enjoy every moment you can.❤ from Oklahoma
Oh yeah… AND DRINK HABIT! 🌱🫖🍵
Bec your hair is growing so beautifully and I can’t believe you guys are 6 months pregnant congratulations I love your videos so much
I'm one of those 10% of people who have some gene that makes Cilantro taste like soap. When you don't like it, does it taste like soap? 😅 I hate it hahaha. Looks like a fun day!
I’m just so inspired by you guys. The love and life y’all radiate is amazing. Thank you for sharing your journeys!!
Graving sweets might mean you need some more protein.
Happy Sunday to your family from ours ❤️ Love seeing the wholesome content. Hello from Halifax, NS.  Sending lots of love during this weird and wonderful time 🥰
Hey Eamon&Bec hope you are having an amazing Sunday here watching from Ireland and congratulations on your baby girl we can’t wait to see her🩷🩷
I got pregnant with twins when our 4th child was just 2 months old. We planned on having two close together, but thought it would take longer where I was nursing and never expected twins. I remember my husband walking in, seeing me nursing one, growing two and just saying how amazing the female body is. Yes, I agree. Our bodies perform miracles and literally create humankind.
I had my first baby at 24 weeks. We were amazed as we watched him develop outside the womb in the NICU for 73 days, miracles!
I’ve been watching you guys since the beginning, you guys are so strong especially bec you’re the definition of super women!!! You have so much love and support from all over the world. SENDING LOVE FROM TORONTO❤️❤️❤️
YAY!!!!! 💜💜💜 My Purple Heart people! And one for Oso 💜 and Bob 💜
When you asked each other what are we going to do, I thought oh maybe a road trip, a walk or a movie. Never expected the next minute to be shoveling up gravel 😳you two are some of the hardest working people I’ve ever seen. You both do beautiful work. Stay safe vickie
My dads dog used to eat stones love your videos & you guys ❤
I’d recommend using a wooden spoon with honey
Yes my German shepherd will chew on rocks and carry them around.  I have to ALWAYS watch her. She's worn down some of her teeth actually 😢
You look great Bec, Im praying for you guys. Jesus loves you guys❤
Bec has been through so much this year, I’m so happy how she is doing now, bringing life into this world!!! ❤ so proud of you mama!! And eamon is such a great guy to have by your side. 😊 Can’t wait to meet her! Baby lee ??⭐️
Congratulations to you both.. glad to see you better also.. love from England
❤❤❤❤
Y’all radiate so much positivity. So happy for you both!
I need the curry recipe please
36 weeks pregnant here and feeling huge! So enjoying following your journey😊
Watching you from a beach in Greece while enjoying the sunset  🇬🇷 🌅  Love to see you blossom during pregnancy, a big hug! ❤
Are you guys still going to make videos when you have the baby?
Stop the rock eating asap. My neighbor's dog just had surgery to remove rocks from his stomach.  💛
36 years old and my first baby just turned 6 week. She’s is the BEST!!!!!
I always look forward to your videos on Sundays 😊 I’ve been going through a tough time mentally lately, and these are always a nice break from reality. Keep doing what you’re doing and spreading love and positivity! So happy for you guys and your growing fam ♥️
Watching from NS 🇨🇦. Thanks for sharing another amzing video 🤍🤍🤍🤍
❤
Grateful for you both sharing your journey with us! Here since 2018 ❤so excited for this next chapter for you! Sending much love & good vibes from Ottawa!!✨
You guys are my absolute favs! Thank you, for bringing joy into my life every Sunday!
Not currently pregnant. But have a 8m old at home and three others! Love watching you guys from right across the river!
Watching from Kingston,ON!! I am actually 11 months post partum. But love watching your journey and brings me back to when I was pregnant 🥰
My dog who’s under 10 pounds also likes to eat rocks.
What do you reckon is Oso's breed mix? He's such a good boy.
Pregnancy looks amazing on you Bec. I love how supportive Eamon is and appreciative he is to his lady ❤️.
hi from nb
Mornin folks 🖐😎👍
PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE BE SURE: that your honey is raw and unadulterated. MANY honeys contain xylitol which can KILL your dog. Some fast food places honey is not all honey.
Re: Oso trying to eat rocks, my pup is the exact same. She gave me a scare at her last visit when she literally had gravel in her 💩 sample 😖
I'm so happy for you guys! I can't wait to see you guys in this next chapter of life, everything that you guys have been through has all led to this amazing moment <3 love from Miami
So good to see another update found you guys from Kara and Nate in 2020 and so good to see you guys going well keep up the good work with this vids and and cant wait for the baby. PS love the barbie movie reference made me laugh such a good movie wish you well
You are such an inspiration Bec, honestly you are an inspiration to me. Ever since we went through cancer/chemo during the same timeframe I've seen you as a sort of "soul sister" I suppose. Seeing you move on with life makes me so incredibly happy, and I wish you continuous health and joy in life always ❤️❤️❤️
Please don't stop filming after baby girl is here! I lost my chances for grandchildren when my only child passed and you have given me what feels like a chance again!❤
Hello Eamon and Bec you've come along way and i can't wait to meet the beautiful princess
I just love your videos every single Sunday
Hiiiii love you guys
Bec you are such an inspiration❤️ the videos  of you and Eamon bring me so much joy😊 been watching since the first lock down in 2020, one of my best decisions😊
Good morning to our favorite YouTube duo & soon to be trio!! My fiancé & I watch your videos Sunday mornings with our coffee☕️ You guys bring so much joy to our hearts EVERYTIME. Thank you💛💛
hi
It's not complaining!  You are in touch with your bodyand noticing all the changes.  This is good!  Never stop!
Bec, it gives me the chills to see you so happy with this little one coming. I am meeting my little great grandson for the first time in just hours and so over the moon happy.
Hello from Poland ❤
I look forward to Sundays with you guys! Your positivity and general good vibes are the best to fight all the Sunday scaries and start the day off right!
Good Morning! Happy Sunday! Love your videos. Watching from Ohio 🚐
Good morning ☀️ just tuned in watching from Chicago ❤
Just wanted to tell you that these videos are the highlight of my week. I love following your journey and I'm so happy and excited for you both to be parents! That's one lucky baby!
Incredible watching this journey, been here since 2018 i think. You released your pregnancy annoucement video while i was in early labour haha. Have a 3 month old boy ✨ Lots of love from France ♥️♥️♥️♥️
I LOVE my Sunday morning visit to Canada! Bec, you’re journey this year has been incredible to follow along with & it made me emotional watching the flashbacks in todays video & how far you’ve come! Amazing! All the love 🤍
OMG I think it’s time to unsubscribe. As CF person I can’t take it any longer.
It's amazing how strong Bec is, I mean a year ago she had breast cancer and now she is starting a beautiful family!
Ily❤
Why do you give Osso honey? Any type of honey,from Deb in NZ

I love that your pregnant Bec and Eamon your gonna be great parents love to you both xxx
I love this
My Italian cane corso fully eats rocks as well.
Have you put linseed oil on your decks?
Love you ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Hi friends! So happy to connect with you all from Virginia. Much love Eamon, Bec, Oso and baby!
Good-bye, Eamon and Bec. I wish you all the best for your future, but I have zero interest in preggo and baby content, and will hence bid you farewell.
You so got this Bec, you are amazing and your body will never let you down as you also treat it with respect, love and kindness! You are going to be an awesome Momma❤❤ Eamon you are an awesome man and such a loving partner and will make a wonderful father
I love you videos and I always get hungry watching them lol.  I need your hot oats breakfast recipe!! Also what oats do you use?
So happy for both of you!  Nobody deserves this more than the two of you ❤❤❤. This feeling of a little human growing and thriving inside you, well its the most beautiful feeling, take it from this 58 year old person my children are my biggest joy 🤩 😊
I’m currently a first time mom of a 10 month old(officially tomorrow) and it’s been such a joy to see you two in your journey to parenthood because it’s such an amazing journey! So excited for you two!
I think you should change Bec's pic in your logo (0:29 second mark of the video). Half with long hair and half bald to represent the beauty and the warrior. It would be fitting...   🙂
Love the baby belly you guys are awesome congratulations
Awesome videos sorry I’m soo late
Bec has been through a lot this past year. And now she is bringing more joy into the home. I’ve been here since 2020 and I’m just so PROUD!
26 weeks with a baby boy! Also a first time mom! Have loved watching you guys since your first trip to Baja and sharing these pregnancy mems with you all the way from Texas ❤️🥰
20 weeks on tuesday!! Love watching your journey so much ❤
Lucky us. New Video. I didnt expect a video at all and its a looooong one video😊 have a great sunday
I'm 28 weeks tomorrow. I'm due December 18. I'm experiencing discomfort when I'm on my feet for long times. Little hip pain, and back pain. But I am welcoming it all. And I couldn't be more happy or content being pregnant. This has been the best pregnancy ever. After 4 losses, im enjoying every minute
omg i was just waiting for it
Your beautiful plump pregnant face is just the absolute best.  You look so healthy and happy... YAY FOR BEC!!!!❤
I can’t believe you are six plus months already. Time is flying fast, not for you I’m sure. 😂
Please tell us everything you just put on your face this morning.  Thanks!
yes ❤
When I was pregnant one the craziest things for me was hearing my hips pop.
Sometimes it's strange to think that I've known you both for years and we've never met. I'm loving watching you become such amazing people!
Wow you two lovey people I am so happy for both you I cried. Enjoy every minute yous totally deserve lots of love from one of your biggest fans frank ❤❤😊

Good morning! Happy Sunday ❤! As I mentioned in my bathroom chat, I feel like many of you are on a fertility and/or pregnancy journey and I'd love to use this comment section as a place where we can connect. How far along are you? How are you feeling? Sending love to all x
