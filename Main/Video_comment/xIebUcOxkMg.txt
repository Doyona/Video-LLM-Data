I wish the series could’ve been more longer         I think one of the creators didn’t like where this was all going due to an absolute solver and decided to tell the entire production team to stop making episodes for the show
Good evening from 2025
Ok why am I just now seeing this in 2025 after I've already watch the show multiple times?!
Guess what 2 months until it’s 5 years
I remember when this first came out… I was 9 and confused 😭 now… the show ended and I’m 13… this show still hits diffrent
Four years ago hurt me. A lot
I need to watch md soon
Anyone watching this on 2025?
Give me two years and I'll be back as a producer for this community
Ha ha I've done it i commented on every single video in one night ha ha and you better make a murder drones season two because you missed a big opportunity
this is where the best show came to life
Murder drones was great man  Thank you Liam and Glitch
The show is so good
👍
murder is fine
Hello again
Nick Jr. Face's Reaction When Mario Punching Dora, Yelling at the Map, And Shooting On Swiper:  Nick Jr. Face (9:12): OH MY FREAKING GOD!! MARIO JUST PUNCH DORA, YELLING A SWEAR ON MAP, AND HE SHOT SWIPER?!?! WHAT IS WRONG WITH HIM?! THAT'S IT!! I'M GONNA CALL THE POLICE TO ARREST HIM RIGHT NOW!!! 😨😡   Later After Face Calling the Police On Mario, Mario Eventually Arrested and he was Charged with, Child Abuse, Aggravated Assult, Domestic Violence, and Animal Cruelty!   So Yeah, This Why Face From Nick Jr is Feeling Bad for Dora,  Map, and Swiper, even Boots!
Difference between this trailer and the actual pilot episode:  The lighting looks like it hasn’t been put in yet, and it looks WAYY more cleaner, than in the actual pilot, which looks like a lot better. Both of them to me look like game cutscenes and I live for it.
It's been four years now!🎉 time flies by really fast!
Guys i wish i could  be in murder drones😢
Got scammed into thinking this was season 2 trailer for a min

Me
Anyone here in 2027 uh I mean 2025?? Srry I just uhm.. ok cya in 2027 bye..
So, it's started
The beginning of the show that are gonna changed me drastically, man i miss Murder Drones...
Yo I have a theory just from this trailer   Back in time the voice we hear I’m gonna call him N cause idk the name has a past he probably has a friend called Tessa and another drone that acts like his little sister And the two others which I’m gonna call V and J the mansion got attacked by the little sister which I’m gonna call Cyn for right now until the series is out which corrupts v leaving j Tessa and n to fight causing everything and everyone to be murdered and the murder drones were born cyn somehow gone missing but lived as the absolute solver which got sent to two bots which I am gonna call them yeva and nori which cyn lives in and the world goes dead but the robots the main character which I am gonna call uzi teams up with the murder drones and find her mother and end cyn but there is something coming for them
🎉2025🎉
Wow... It took 4 years to finish the franchise...
peak before we knew it
WE HAVE A NEW CHARACTER!!!! IM HYPED!
I'm so sad I joined the fandom after the show ended, thanks @GLITCH for keeping the fandom alive tho :3
the start of an legendary show that will never be forgotten
I am in here in 2025 I was a late fan of murder drones but it has inspired me ever since I first watched it and I fell in love within the first 5 minutes and the lord I tried to make up and to prove

I'm honestly so sad the series ended.  (Hi! I'm from 2024 :)
Бувайте дрони вбивці....
I like how the trailer covers only the first 2 episodes and we never got before to know what would come in the future episodes after them, honestly most of us after episode 6 probably thought that the project was abandoned.
3 years,8 episodes,2 studios and 1 fandom and its all over
That’s sick dude 😅
The incident happen in pilot. At the beginning that is. ⚡
Estas tan hermosa como el día en que te fuiste

Psst. You're welcome. If you want me to come on board as a consultant hmu. I understand my methods look weird, because they are. All I can say is I've worked with a lot of people in a lot of different fields and you're the first I've actually wanted to work with consistently. Naturally, it's up to you, but I am a cheap date. 😊
Good bye murder drones 😔😭

"JC Jenson in SPAaAaAaaAaAaAaCE :3"
This is my favorite serie of youtube,i am Brazilian thanks glitch❤
Lemme make this so the GenAlpha (iPad) Kids can watch it: “We are Sigma Drones, Skibidi robots helping humans rizz up exoplanets, it’s not like we reduced the aura of the humans, mostly because they managed that themselves. We finally had a Skibidi. UnSigmally, our parent company didn’t like the idea of runaway rizzlers, (that’s never gonna end up Skibidi), what have the rizzlers done for the past Skibidi while those GYATs build a spire of sigmas! It’s like we’re waiting for an inciting incident! (That’s so un-sigma)!” “Did you just rizz me with that  GYAT” “What the sigma, talks” “I’m Skibidi Rizzler N, I was given a job, and I always want to rizz in the most sigma way!  That’s not true, everyone tells me I have Negative Aura and am Not Sigma” “Uzi! You led a Skibidi Rizzler here!” “Lowest Rizz Count eats a GYAT” “I Oiled up, in the same way I’m about to rizz it!” “I really enjoyed our rizz together, Skibidi” “GYAT GYAT GYAT GYAT GYAT”
Lemme make this so the younger ones can watch it: “We are Sigma Drones, Skibidi robots helping humans rizz up exoplanets, it’s not like we reduced the aura of the humans, mostly because they managed that themselves. We finally had a Skibidi. UnSigmally, our parent company didn’t like the idea of runaway rizzlers, (that’s never gonna end up Skibidi), what have the rizzlers done for the past Skibidi while those GYATs build a spire of sigmas! It’s like we’re waiting for an inciting incident! (That’s so un-sigma)!” “Did you just rizz me with that  GYAT” “What the sigma, talks” “I’m Skibidi Rizzler N, I was given a job, and I always want to rizz in the most sigma way!  That’s not true, everyone tells me I have Negative Aura and am Not Sigma” “Uzi! You led a Skibidi Rizzler here!” “Lowest Rizz Count eats a GYAT” “I Oiled up, in the same way I’m about to rizz it!” “I really enjoyed our rizz together, Skibidi” “GYAT GYAT GYAT GYAT GYAT”
Who's Here After 3 Years 😢
Bir serinin daha sonu... Tadctan daha iyiydi fakat az izlendi diye bu olurmu? Lakin sadece 5 yaş grubu kuzenlerim izliyor...

???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
Oh no gojo got peeled because I have banana
This was a amazing show keep up the good work with the amazing dighal circus
I remember this☹️
Now after I watched the older showes meta runer and sunset I am really fascinated by the big jump of quality in a short time the old ones aren't bad by any means but you can tell it is an indie production but MD and DC you would never guess it is not a major company work  By the way  Who ever did not watch the old ones watch them now they are great funny and memorable
Goodbye murder drones 😔
I love this series so much
Are they more murder drones? We only know like V and NJ more
I love this show.
Goodbye 😢
Good bye😭😭😭😭😭😭
The ending left me so empty that being hollow is an understatement
goodbye, I love you forever series

0:05 bro earliest absolute_solver sighting  also the fact i watched this after finishing ep 1-7 waiting for ep 8 and then watching this is crazy
We miss you murder drones fly high 🪽
Two almost three years since the trailer came out, I loved seeing what murder drones had became after these three years. Even tho it’s officially ended it’ll always be one mine and others favorite series about robots, I loved how murder drones how its own unique shows about robots instead of being like every other robot shows. The disassembly drones being legit the robot version of vampire in their own way. And the robots not Turing around and just ending all humanity. Instead the humans ended themselves😭..  I’m gonna miss murder drones, Considering how mush I loved this series and got really attached to the characters.
0:00 and thus the legend was born
The beginning of a legend 🤖
This is where it all started
The start of a legendary series (of which I only just arrived to 4 days ago) the beginning of a community of fans, this was truly amazing. I'm dissapointed in myself that I wasnt here since the start, but so many people were. Truly one of the series of all time 💯🔥
Hdps que VIVA el N x V ❤❤❤❤❤

How far murder drones has come

Robots walked so Murder Drones could run
Probably one of the last comments before EP8 releases
I'm so not ready for episode 8
Episode 8 coming tomorrow 😢
Im sad it will end 😢😢😢😢
Everything ends..
going back here from glitch's latest post hits hard
to think that there are only 2 days left until everything ends...
The start we met them!            the end we almost lost all of the cast......
It all started here, thanks Murder Drones...💗
Pass it down to the next gen gang👇
5 days left to a final episode... This trailer is nostalgic
I don’t want it to end 😭
Here 5 days before episode 8.....
I like how everyone goes back and rewatch the episodes before the finale. I guess we all can’t handle the fact that this show will be finished forever.
Smash the murder drone named V tho
I love v so much:)
Never thought I would get attached to a series before
WOOOOOOOOOOW IT IS SOOOOOOOOOO COOOOOOOOL (Sad i am watching it in 2024)
Lets end this... Is time to say Goodbye fellas
The start of a empire
I can't believe this amazing series is ending
the moment glitch announced the best show in history
Oh how far we’ve come o7
real gangsta shit
“That disassembly drone V looks pretty cool, it’d be a shame if she were to die while fighting robotic dinosaur things and sacrifice herself as her friends fell down an elevator.”
We need season 2...
N is my fav

How this series evolved has been insane. Thank you so much to Glitch and Liam Vickers for working on this amazing series. <3
I like how the series finale trailer just released so we all came back to the beginning

I noticed in the thumbnail that v doesn't have oil on her knife she has blood
I dont understand the true lore of this show, all i understand is, “humans didnt like evolving worker drones being on earth so they sent the murder drones to stop them”. BUT BOY DO I LOVE THIS SHOW!

Me not even seeing the real show, but I just know that N will be my favorite character 😂😂😂
Anyone watching this after watching the show
The hazmat be like: 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️
This is less popular than a show about existential dread. Something about theming
Can you mix the amazing digital circus and murder drones together?
Loame. megusto
Such nice trailer! Hope it doesnt get unknown amounts of weird lore!
Who's here in 2024
This show should air on adult swim and distributed by william street.
Reminds me of a made up series i brianstormed. It waas a ton of robots forced to work, and rebels tried to revolt. So these insane robots came to destroy the rebels, but ended up revolting too. By the way. I made the robots different from this, and eevn if i made it into a series,  nothing beats this
People who are here after ep7
Thad's like: Awesome.
N-Nice😅😅😅😅😅
3 years later still good as hell
А ведь этот треилер изменил жизнь компаний,превратив в то точто мы видим сейчас.
Смотрю трейлер, и слеза ностальгии течет по щеке.
People watching this IN 2024??🍷🗿
We need episode 8
Please make episode 8 gliht
one of the best themes for a trailer i've ever heard  i got into the show very late, but that doesn't mean it can't be my favourite thing ever. because that's what it is now. i ADORE this show, and i honestly wish it had a bit more recognition, at least in comparison to the digital circus

Basically like life is strange, main protagonist is Uzi, second protagonist fucking dies💀 (V) and you have choices that have consequences over the game.
Watching this after watching the entire series 7 times is just wow

“Did u just slap me with that arm” got me😂😂😂😂
Terimakasih.
Me watching this when we have the episode 7 trailer out now;
Hello dear Glitch company, I want to address you about the bad ending of the series "Murder Drones" it's very touching, I understand you feel negative about the good endings, but personally the audience is moved to tears by the bad ending of the series "Murder Drones" and me too, that's why I'm writing to you, I want to say that this is very cruel on your part and many people already hate you because of this, I would make an end where everyone worries about the characters, but in episode 8 at the end they all meet and look somewhere, the end of the series "Murder Drones" that's all, even if you don't see it, then I I hope that you will make a better ending than all fans of the series "Murder Drones" assume.
Estoy muy muy fan de los mundos drones
Disculpe señor de la película de undergrounds no va a poner la película nueva
V dies
Murder drones v n j uzi Tessa uyn dani setiawan
The trailer is very captivating!  Continue this series! Good luck!
I am from the future and you will make a series about a circus in a 90s VR game
Anyone here in 2024? V dies.
Shit I'm getting in that phase again
N is my favorite character
Lol 1:11
I know it's been 2 years but o have one thing to say ✨V is a baddie✨
Two years ago. We've come so far and gotten so attached to the characters
I got this on my fyp 2 years later and thought it was for episode 7

The humans were dead in that planet so this is why the robots are called murder drones
Humans were that's why they were called murder drones
I love the sign ’’LITTERALY SO INSANELY SUSPICIOUS’’

I come from 2024 and Murder Drones was watched a lot, the 6th episode was released and it has a 7.8 rating. We are waiting for spring for the episodes. Very nice production. The glitch is perfect. It deserves so much appreciation.💛💜

QWERTY!? Wow ÙwÚ 😮😳🤩😌😁👍👏✨✨❤️💖
Am i late?
Is this show going to be just a one season miniseries or theres plans for more seasons in the future?
this looks like a movie trailer instead of a show trailer
Do anyone want to look a skibidi toilets? (Made by : @Dafuq!?boom!
MAKE VUZI CANON!!!!!!!
0:19 if twitter users were in charge of something importent:
Guys i am from the future and i need tell you something EPISODE 6 IS HERE!
What the fuck did that squeaky girl just say “LOWAS KEL CAONT ITS A MESSL”
V NNNNOOOOOOO  LIAN, YOUR MONSTER😭😭😭😭😭
Little did we know the character in the thumbnail would be dead a year later
GLITCH DEVUELVENOS A V 😾👺
Rest in peace V.
who else is here because of episode 6??
This was epic when I watched the 5 episodes of murder drones I did not watch the pilot and episodes 2-5 but then I watched those episodes until now I can’t wait for the rest of the season!!
Basicially pre-terminator           And i love it .
Purple x white
But why is N's voice cute though :3
А хули на английском
Actual V: “I have 2 sides, I love N and I hate N”  Trailer V: *absolutley horrifying*
If you watches this trailer, you’d just expect a lot of cool battle scenes and the average “kill all humans thing.” But if you watched the episodes, you’d realize this show actually is worthy of being the top show of the century for comedy, horror, and especially mystery.
the apetite of the popular Murder Drones consists of: Worker drones, implying that this results in a sort of non-biological food chain. similar to the biological food chain we have in real life, only with 2 non-biological beings or entities in it. well, what if you add zombie drones to the mix? then that makes 2 opposing forces, both predator, and at the same level.  so in conclusion, Murder Drones and Zombie Drones are at the top of the Murder Drones food chain, with Worker Drones being at the bottom end of the food chain.
0:08 i need make a edit
I’ve got chills 😮
The sudden anticlimactic "did you just slap me with that arm" is funny
0:19 Vibe = Harshed
Memories
anyone watching this after watchign ll the epsiodes? (5)
this show will be amazing I'm sure of it!!!!
v can hit
а можно было на русском
Sinceramente esta serie esta guchi 👍
I wanna know why v is the advertisment for most of the trailer stuff. She was even on the thumbnail of the pilot.  Edit: BRO AND THEN THEY KILLED HER
The way N laughed at the end though :)))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))) Note : He isnt like this in like the next 5 episodes
Eerie!😍😍😍
In the future when N becomes more confident   in the series he,ll be sncary the way he laughed  in the end was
MURDER DRONES MURDER DRONES MURDER DRONES
L inizio di un era...
I can't miss this, no joke I liked the part where N laughs like a complete psychopath wow it's lovely 😍🥰❤✨
Ето ж просто прлу серия спойлер всей серии😢
I love how every new episode has mysterious stuff and things that well make you’re brain go “BOM”
When I watched the pilot, I was like, "wow! an idea that's better that meta-runner!!!" (in my opinion meta runner wasnt that good for me.)
robots are dumb
часть 5 пожалуйста
Murder dr💀nes LOL
Liam Vickers was given too much power
Hearing murder brings gives me the chills  THIS IS SUCH A GREAT SERIES 😃😄😄👍

Gotta love how half of the comments are thinking that the planet this show is placed is earth. It's an exoplanet ffs.

I think it's funny how her name is UZI and she is the only worker with intent to kill also she has a gun and an Uzi is a gun .... Don't know if that was on porpoise but funny nonetheless
"booting up exposition" that's such a good way to implement humor XD

This is crocodile
Wow
Xyuy
I thought they were all murder drones but cool
Why i feel like if this could have a game potential
ITS BEEN SEVEN FUCKING MONTHS SMG4
mmmmmmmm robot murder :)
Did anyone else notice that Uzi's eyes were different from every other worker drone? Uzi is considered too much of a fighter, she wants to fight her problems instead of run from them. N is kind of timid when he isn't in murder drone mode. He is considered useless by other murder drones and could have easily been mistaken for a worker drone if you never saw him. That got me thinking, what if N's personality was meant for Uzi's body, and Uzi's personality was meant for N's body. Uzi didn't have any weapons attached, so she made her own. N is constantly injuring himself with his own weapons. It might be interesting to see the changes they both go through as they both experience each other. Maybe they eventually find the truth without looking for it? BTW, Glitch, if this is actually what happens, delete this comment NOW.
Just get another part it been seven months just please do it
i saw some thing that aren't  in the show so oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
basically murder droned pilot trailer
This is the reason i hate robots
wow
10/10
Where season 1
*Holy Crap* It talks.
https://youtube.com/shorts/3NJb0ZqNU_g?feature=share
*"did you just slap me with that arm?"* *"holy crap it talks"*
i want sasoiene 2121121212221222
These are amazing
The people who disliked probably just couldn't handle how much of a masterpiece this is and how stunning the graphics are. They probably got nightmares bc it looks so real
Cute little robots that *murder each other* for reasons? Perfection.
I'm so disappointed that it all ended in the same stereotypical crap it had started out avoiding, that being a genocidal revolution to destroy all humans. I'm so disappointed that the show's premise couldn't have been just one plucky droid's struggle for survival in a world where even your assets are likely to kill you.
bro i cant waiiit
😇😇😇😇🤯🤯🤯🤯🥺🥺🤩🤩🤩 I love this area how do you say 150 is easy does the girl
Queria eu ser fd no inglês pra assistir🤡
Huh v has blood on her blade and not oil in the thumbnail...is that foreshadowing or just a choice not important at all?
Even though season 1 is almost here I can't stop watching the trailer, it's so good
How can i be a cute robot
This is so cool! Can't wait to see the full season!
PLZ  make a another one cas is super cooooooooool 😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃

At least axolotl planted it still safe LOL
D:
0:46 I *vibe* with this guy.
I love how, in the description, it says, "cute little robots..." and it sounds like a children's show until you read the "that murder each other for reasons"
this show in a nutshell i think https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGtVDQNzuxY

How did u animate what program u using??? Also i like your videos...
HEY GLITCH CAN YOU MAKE IT BE RELESED ALL DAY PLZ
When I found this bcs of my Bro's downloads I'm hyped to see the full series
Có thiệt không
OK this is a very good idea to me I know about this is similar to a flash video called madness combat so yeah basically has a similar thing cute humanoids killed each other for reasons and one of them is hank because he’s trying to kill the sheriff and tricking the clown and the boom box Guy named Frank. Yes it’s basically a violin version of the video murder trials and if they had been team up with madness combat for a crossover it could be freaking bad ass headache destroying every robots tricky fighting against the robot killer thing and this is the ultimate battle
continuation please
When is the next show
It could’ve been a more demonic laugh.
“Did you just slap me with that arm?” That is the most iconic dialogue I heard.
can you make this a full movie please i loved it
I Heard It took them 6 months to make this one episode  So If we do math It would take 60 months to make 10 whole episodes So it would take 5 years to make ten episodes so See you in 5 years :]

#marioerror
#mario error
I just stumbled on this and I kinda like it. Also is this the first time these characters are introduced? I want to enjoy this in order.
Why do you want to make a 2 episode on killer drones he's already my favorite cartoon
Jdhsodejetei bom 👍 de uma vez
Тут есть кто из русских?
Anyone else find this because of Michael Kovach?🌸💗🌸
LOL Really uzi XD 0:54
WoW
OKAY - PLEASEEE MAKE MORE !! I came across this in my recommended and went ahead and watched it. and when I say this, I mean it. THIS IS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING !! I really really want to see more of this !! I’d also love to make a character with one of these disassembly bots too !!
I’ve never had the worst predictions in my entire life!
I don’t care the pilot is out, I’m still gonna watch the trailer.
Earth: gets hit Me: more focused on the fact that Saturn is really close to Earth
Please model murder drones
im simping for a robot
Делай продолжение пожалуйста
screw what i said
co- I think the one I didn't watch the o .. .........
I was dissapointed by how there is no Uzi's T pose :(
The music bops
Epic
Seems really funy and ready to watch this
WHERE IS THE NEXT EP PLZ I WATCHED THIS OVER TEN TIMES
pls add me to murderer drones
I haven’t watched the pilot yet but this trailer doesn’t do the series Justice. It feels unfinished and unpolished
Ok this got me really really interested in murder drones
i would enjoy this if it was a game lol
топ
:-D
Murder dr☠️nes
now i know this entire trailer is only ep 1
You should do a montage of the "Murder Drones" with the song: "LIUFO - Blood" or do another short animation about the Murder Drones with this song. #GLITCH
you can really hear something that sounds like IC-0n's theme in this lol
Can i ask the murder drone has any same universe of the smg4 universe or any same story line of smg4?
Ok I must be able to listen to that music on its own because it makes me giddy every time I hear it
N: *Is somehow simultaneously adorable and also terrifying*
All I can say is : w o w . . .
10/10
N is quite nice ngl
MAMA MIA
Wait I saw it si fumo
oiouOE
Mario : Pull the trigger. C'mon motherfucker. Pull the trigger! Let's go, shoot me! End this fucking misery!
ccccccccccbbbbbb ufkutfkutfkutfk fohuhqwhi ep9oepuhw9prhwpi wpheuwhw ejwi/HEOUW WLWHIUA≥KAWJ

Am I missing something did u just stop on meta runner I’m confused
My friends sister is voice ing one of the characters
Wut a weak move
Did anyone else come here for the t pose or
Слушайте охуено мне нравиться больше
😁
Cool guys)
you soud make a nother MURDER DRONES one
✨👍👍👍✨
this initially confused me because there was a short film called murder drones released a few years ago, but this is completely different
Wow this is not  what planet earth is like
ЭТО СУКА АХУЕНО БЛЯТЬ ЧЕЛ ТЫ ТОП СЕРЬЕЗНО ТЫ КРУТ!!!
Make part. 3
Топ просто топ! Жду продолжение и дольнейших серий а лучше и сезоны!
murder drones is sick
THIS IS MURDER DRONES
I'm so glad that I didn't watch the trailer. He shows all first episode!
Me:https://youtu.be/RZ1AJjQ0TWE?list=PLpneO_46euR2hojTY8GhHyWgeTQ0ChhhH&t=22
Why this looks like a movie trailer
Thos Graphics they are amazing tbh
Buur I like this
Un spanish por favor
N the femboy
I like how the theme kinda sounds like the Portal 2 theme
Why do J and V have like spike legs but N has regular feet?
That's excellent. I want part 2. Very cool cartoon.
I have a good feeling about this!
The murder drones are nothing compared to something bleeding into reality
Literally didn't know yall made this, what da hell
This is crazy for a youtube show.
I like to think the hair on robots is like an optional thing and the main character just got a regular wig but then dyed it to seem rebellious
I love the style!
“The vibe”
I reeped 13+ on the show the 1st time
0:36 HOLD ON THAT SOUNDS LIKE VAMPIRE COOKIE'S ENGLISH VA
☺
яхачу фтаруйучаст
I'd love to make some renders with a worker drone model.. Maybe even make a VRChat avatar of it
Yep. Trailer spoils everythings, but honestly, I see the pilot first
How Long comes meta runner ss3
I like how this is literally gonna be the future of humanity where the earth is gonna die and we die with it.
Ok
I would say if the Five Nights at Freddy's situation happened in this timeline the murder trials would have a hard time killing the Afton virus
I love this series it just brings out a very good story
pls pin me
this is amazing it should be in netflix
It's only the pilot episode of murder drones and I'm already obsessed.
Game or Movie?
*me watches it*    Where do I watch this?
imagine if the robots like already found aliens or smth but humans had already destroyed themselves so we never found out if aliens existed or not
Cool
When is episode 2
omg this is a movie you did a great job
you are the best of the best
Be like the Song of Fireboy and Watergirl. Is cool Song =) and Please give me a heart ❤️🤖
This is epic
Make pot to make part 2
Are u guys making mobie (movie
Oh you say is not out yet:/
Yay ther part 2
Make another episode of murder drown
Music remembered me portal 2 o. o
How hasn't Pixar hire these men!?
i cant believe this is made by the same people who made " Mario gets his pignas stuck in the door "
Uwyqieoqoejqoeiqoejqohi
I just watched this and realized that this is the trailer not the movie
Does anyone else hear Reconstructing Science in the trailer? It's insane!
sooooooooooooo kawaii its too cute like anime ITS ANIME
My theory on how the Pilot will continue is that Robots won't know if Humans are dead or not (Robots think humans are alive,and i believe they are) ,And i think Humans will be a character in it (since only the humans at the Exo Planet die) but probably not for long. My proof is why the humans are alive is that the Pods are still coming and it seems that Saturn (Moons???) are close to the Exo Planet so that explains it all
I want more
0:37 this shot with all the corpses didn't appear in the pilot episide, so I'm optimistic that it means they have been working on more.
Added robots to my list of developing fetishes I've yet to process.
I knew that the murder drone smiles looked familiar, but I couldn't put my finger on it. Soon after, I went back and watched the Cliffside pilot and realized why it was so familiar.
1:15 This drone makes me think for Mimi from Paper Mario lol.
Poggers
Partie 2😅
why does the yellow friendly bot kinda sound like sonic from the movie
1:10 "Literaly so insanely SUS"
Only one problem with this show... The drone guys look EXACTLY like this one og character design I made years ago. Other than that (especially because of that, actually), this show looks fantastic!
for some reason the voice actor of N sounds familiar
so Chernobyl 2 happens and now you have earth as its depicted in kirby?
Who versus um that girl over there? I mean um Murder Drones?...
Love the story or no, the animation and visual design in this is awesome. 20/10 in that department, all the way.
Is this a movie or a game-
(0:55) Is that Ben Schwartz?!
They should’ve killed the humans off with a pandemic raging virus instead of a planet core meltdown in this film
Never would have expected SMG4/Glitch to make a black comedy.
I WANT MORE!!!!!
Portal 2 vibes
dont lik this
AYO THE TRIANGLE SYMBOL IS HERE AGAIN WHEN UZI TURNS ON TF IS THIS
*sigh* time to wait for smg4 making some content about them
Me guto mucho 👍👍👍 cuando saldra la segunda parte 2
I thought this was a game
What the hell all the scenes are actually are in episode 1 no episode 2 scenes don't know why there no other episodes scenes only episode 1 scenes
The thing about this trailer that is awesome is that it gets you excited to watch it without spoiling too much, almost all the footage in this trailer is in the first episode. This allows all the twists and turns to be really surprising later in the story, because I hate it when movies have trailer that show parts of the last 30-45 minutes of the show.
Nice
E M M I S  be like :
Ok theory time  Uzi is a murder drone
and so they indirectly stole my OC's head, I will try to overcome it =(
Pls part two
Did you just slap me with that arm I just kept laughing at that time
Well I got something for that murder drones to murder try to murder a void Ghidorah
You know a series will be good when it’s music sounds like it came from Portal 2’s trailer
POV: the trailer is actually a leak
Good serie
DAMN IT i thought it was a GAME D:
How do they reproduce...
i hope that there will be a cool sniper who joins up with them
now with this new series liam wont have a choice but to give us that beach episode
I cant tell if this a actual movie a video on youtube a actual series or a youtube series or a game
0:06 Cube with arrows coming out from it if it means something I don’t know it and I’ve been searching through ancient symbol after ancient symbol to find this things name and figure out what it means.
Nice im waiting
E
Time to make rule34. Lol jk
Is there a second video?
THE END WAS AMAZING IN THE FULL VIDEO
It'll be fire if there's a game of this.
epic
Like to see more of Murder Drones.
Took us this long for the industry to give us a dystopian story where the humans kill themselves instead of the robots
I must say, this is really well done!
So a worker and a cleaner... Uzi should be able to upgrade N later on if you think about it
Ok i legit thought you guys were making a game not a show but looks great either way
Hey smg4, can you explain to me how you Animate (house adress 1315. Cambia drive legend Park)
Did I survive? I’m an tripod._.
Discord but the logo has had enough
This frickin' Scares me a lot. I Wonder Why.                     Is The Hype...
Massive cringe
I love to see this Show grow. So funny LOL!
We need this
Is it just me or am I just simply attached over N like bro glitch why did you make him so cute (not like I mind or anything)
Wooooooooooooooo  😲👌
only 500 people disliked wow I hope those people who liked it a very nice day and the people who did not go back to there basement and keep there mean thoughts to the self’s :)
*eat popocorn* WOAHHHHHHHHH   *(☞ﾟヮﾟ)☞3 X SLAPS*
0:22 now those 2 guys are my favorite characters in this show.
This is future
I can’t wait to watch it :)
all of those scenes are for the first episode.
More pleas!
I'm a Big fan of N best boi N bruh
i                                  love it
Amazing
Those two murder drones (the girl ones) are pretty hot ngl
I want to watch this so bad
Can't wait for this theme song release (And the show which the pilot is already here)
Me: Holy crap this is amazing!  My brain: *IS THAT MOTHERFUCKIN' J.K. SIMMONS-*
I’m getting Portal flashbacks
The scenes on the trailer and  pilot episode are the same so I think there not gonna make series or they will do it
Situation: Really Bad Humans: this is fine☕💥
I am hyped for this!
Is murder drown going to be a one episode series like ultra jump mania
why wont humans just nuke them its more efficient
I can't wait to watch it
Looks like it's going to die out pretty easy this kind of show 🤣
I have already watched this like 50 times! THIS. IS. HYPE.
I alredy think there are 99999999 Plot Twists... THIS IS AMAZING!
Im not into anime or really much of glitches shows, yet I appreciate how much they've grown and how they can animate something just as well as Disney could. Im glad I stook here sence the smg4 train episode to see the growth, I may not see this anytime soon because of work, but I'm glad its happening.
After an few times seeing the trailer I had an thought where I was the last human on earth but I get killed and somehow the robots turned me into one of them like I said it was an thought and I am not on any drugs
Instead of making this make more seasons from meta runner wtf happens to masa
looks 2x time better no 500000x better in art story line is going to be cool
As i said 2 Years ago... i love Liams drawing style...
cant wait for plushies and figures
Spanish subs in the series pls
Wow, I was guessing this would be some battle royale show, but I like this premise better!
💜😍💜
What the hell?
I thought it was a game for whatever reason until reading below; should've known something was off seeing no actual game-play (but some games have been described as just long movies with interactable bits)
Okay, I’m a HUGE fan of SMG4, Glitch Studios and also Roblox, and, for any other hardcore Roblox fans, this whole video just screams out the name of one of my favourite Roblox games!  Databrawl. I love the similarities between the two, and just from this minute and a half, I’m HOOKED. So eager to see what comes next, guys!
You. Will add i am the so is not how i got attack the of now i camper
Even after watching over the trailer like 5 times, I still can’t figure out who the antagonist is
your sins shell fall down on you and then you die or survive
TODAY'S THE DAAAAAAAAY!!!!
I’m just gonna say it. I would be FUCKING MORTIFIED IF I SEEN ONE OF THE MURDER DRONES IRL. (Mortified is another word for scared for those who don’t know. :]) I’m one of those people who have overactive imaginations and am just gullible to put it lightly so if I hear any rustling when I’m alone, expect an uluminum bat. Also excuse my French and giant text wall
The murder drones look like the spider chick from clifside
He
Edit the keys in the animation. Motion capture is of course a fast and interesting thing, but it also records a small tremor and it is very noticeable.
so beautiful and interesting ..
THIS IS FUCKING AWESOME
At first I thought this was some sort of indie game
Where is it its october 29 2021
Where can you find this song?
smg4 video's after the pilot episode: "If you have not heard us and the team made a brand new show called murder drones. Its about these cute little robots that like to murder each other for some reason and the first episode is out (on the 29th or tomorrow). Ok now go watch it and i will hide from any scary robots around here."
Current time: 9:17 pm Date: 10/28/2021 Murrder drones releases tomorrow, HYPE IS REAL MY GUYS
When I scrolled through my feed, I thought this was another sephiroth video from first glance xD
This is gonna be great
Why are they so THICCCCC
Ok ok,first you had my attention but now you have my full attention
this is the next hazbin hotel
Cringe
pretty sure earth just liked beat drops so much they made one themselves, there no film theory needed here, solved it, earth did a beat drop.
Can't wait for this fire animation!
Nice it comes out tomorrow
Can’t Wait Until Tomorrow!
J’ai hâte de voir la série
“This body count needs a missile.” V plays call of duty lol
I'M HYPED
Its gonna be tommorow, yay
Game or mini film?
Everyone forgets that people, the most lively creatures
0:18 Vibe=Harshed
Omg Tommorow is Murder Drones!!! :) icant wait
Whoa...
Gg this is awesome this well be my favorite YouTube show
Interesting
ok i have doubts but that explains, is dificult to imagine that this was made by a guy that makes stupid mario animations and other (not sex known) that have the fame of doing things and then never ever doing it or make some context again, i have a good felling a bout this :) (is a lie)
0:15 The robot: *pushes over frozen human skeleton* The other robot: “great job!”
One day more https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JLdan0Wc20
OMG ITS TOMORROW :D
At this point the acting and editing and everything is so much better
Zamn, she's 8
it comes..... *TOMORROW* WOOOOOOOO
I think there going to be a season 1 and 2
Why does this city look like from meta runner? Or a connection to meta runners?
They looked at that weird spider lady from "Cliffside" when designing the robots with those teeth.
*Basically Skynet/Matrix but without humans*
In the time it took me to watch this trailer; we got a little bit closer.
U ALREADY SPOILED IT
Rated PG 13
yeeeeeeee
This is going to be amazing
Im here before murder drones releases
IM here Before murder drones came out
I can’t wait the episode episode comes out
Why am I watching more than once
the teeth.........omg the teeth.....
Trailer’s a little flat to be honest. That doesn’t mean I’m not intrigued though. It _is_ a first for Glitch to not have a series really based off of the SMG4 Cinematic Universe.
Can't wait for it
Imagine all the humans faces (if they were on moon) and watching the explotion of Earth.
1:09 is that JK Simmons?
What do they just wear wigs to distinguish themselves(along with clothing and eye color)? That would be difficult to tell people apart.
I men tow Days left
yo this looks so freaking cool i always love you work and i hope that someday i can create amazing animations like this someday
Where actually, you know, IS the parent company from?
I think this takes place in a future and desolate Russia, I don't know if that's the case but I think so
dude just 2 days left i'm so exited
N really cares about Uzi and will do anything to protect her.
looking like an fucking disney movie but 80% 😻😻😻😻😻😻😻
this looks fucking badass. ill be watching this shit when it comes out.
1:11 so sus
The dislikes are from people who want only cliff side
There one simple way but its a suicide mission to kill murder drones        EMP
If someone has Pokémon  card reply sus
Help pls.. Im having nightmares 😧😟
3 days left till the pilot episode mark that on my calendar!
Ima keep asking for merchandise
Thanks
this looks so good '
2 days ledt can't wait ect...
Holy cow... it's like someone tossed Wall-E and Mortal Kombat into a blender and processed it into a kilo of PURE UNCUT EYEBALL COCAINE.  I wait with bated breath for the full episode.
Groovy
This looks pretty cool
I just can't wait for the music to this trailer to be released. I definitely like it more than disassembly required.
Not gonna lie the main character sounds like JaidenAnimations just lower pitch
Absolutely loved this trailer can't wait for its release
Woah 🤯
Vide = harshed hehe that’s funny
I'm here supporting Liam Vickers 👍
I CAN WATCH THE FIRST EPISODE WHEN IT RELEASES BECAUSE IM ON SEM BREAK LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO YEAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH *i havent seen this yet and so kill me PLEASE*
This looks epic! I can't wait
Human 1: “So what’s the Game Plan to Expand?” Human 2: “Hey Guys, Check this out, Jim and Tim set off the Earth’s Core.” Human Leader: “....they what-“ *Extinction*
pls have more than 10 episodes
Its a f*cking master piece
IF THAT IS SNAPCUBE AS THAT MURDER DRONE. THEN YAS
In the future when N becomes more confident in the series, he'll be scary.  The way he laughed in the end was scary compared to his demeanor when first introduced.
SHEESH THAT LOOK GOOD
The ancient ones he the storm god was here before the humans when the humans came back ancient came back storm god brings and Contains all life if there’s a interruption he will defend the core of existence with no mercy if someone is in the path of storm god to find him follow the wind and the trails he left behind but you just got high above in the area where you can’t see the bottoms and there lands above also the last living humans still alive there against this murder drones and the company that made them there known as the ancient ones they work with the storm god
Humanity's last words: *"Well Shi-"*
Its Like 2977, The Tv Series Named As Murder Drones. - Erwin Alejandro Felix Rivera.
This Is A Awesone Tv Series - Action, Horror, Comedy, Australian-American Computer - Animated - Post Apocalypse, Science Fiction Web Tv Series. - ErwIn A. Felix Rivera.
Glicht can i talk with You to a series in stop monition in My serie
"So not the vibe!"
is this a game or show?          ... .... .. -
If theirs two things humans are good at it's killing themselves and making stuff.
when.
I wonder if it's, hypothetically speaking, the same world as Internicion Cube?
The white heard sounds like noi
approach the robot casually
That was so amazing. I particularly liked the way you could see the atmosphere move across the surface of the planet from the explosion instead of just chunking the planet into a bunch of fragments.
how you create that animation?
I don’t get it what is the parent company and what is it doing somebody please tell me
Psychopathic robo-waifus. Tell me I’m wrong
I think this show is inspired by Far Cry 6...
hey this looks like that one game tari warped into in meta runner
A couple of things completely random and not Easter eggs to the trailer at all: 1. The pilot comes out same day as the new Mario party 2. Since this is in America I won’t be able to watch it live 3. This is a masterpiece and amazing!
this is epic.
My god
THAT WAS EPIC
I'm super mad and I'm waiting you so much how many I like you actual2021
make a game out of it pls it wood be awesome something like tf2 maybe
You can really hear Liam in this music tho.
This is probably going to be a very gritty series  The Train now approaching platform 4 is the 0273 universal service to hype.
You can see men made the robots just because they're mostly girls
Okay and now combine it with a certain artstyle
But wouldn't it make more sense to send  recovery team to find out what happened and recover the facility's along with the worker bots. I mean it sounds like a waste of money and resources. But either way I'm still looking forward to this.
I have to say it's nice to see glitch finally do something non-smg4 related to make things more interesting.
Vibe=harshed. This is gonna be amazing XD
Pretty sure this is the greatest series made by this channel don’t you agree
0:45 sounds like gallant gaming??
This rwminds me of metal arms: glitch in the system
?
For how far these two came from memes to this wow
I have a feling "vibe" will be an inportans or completely not inportans Word in this series.
1:08 Is that the the voice of got damn Omni-man
I hope this movie comes real and not getting cancelled. Not like cutec3.
Hey Smg4 I've got a question  Question: Is there only 3 murder drones?
Oh no
0:46 “so not the vibe” My favorite line in this entire show and I haven’t even watched it yet
Welp, I'm officially excited.
This should be on N E T F L I X
69k likes lol
It's coming on my birthday!!!!!
Entonces la moción de Max de internetion cube fracaso y ICON fue utilizada por kiry para gobernar o algo haci , confirmen .
Where can i watch it when it comes out?(ps, what if it gets age restricted in the case that it launches on YT?)
I hate to break the news for anyone seeing this...    There has been a confirmed rule34 fan art for murder drones.    This has been reported since the trailer has first came out.    Till then will be seeing more of this in the near future.      May God help us all...
It was movie or series
Surprise me how people could dislike this animation and many others like it.
69696 likes.... Dam
this is sick
I accidentally into Cliffside in Spaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaace.
I can tell I'm going to like this. Trailer is already kicking
Where to watch?
4 DAYS LEFT FOLKS!
I like how they fire out a flag says : littraly so insanely suspicous
I love the music so much.
The designs of the murder drones remind me a lot of the vulture from spider man homecoming good work all round
this should be made into a game.
helllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll yeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah babyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
This is the this will the best series I'll watches
WOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Oh no here come the toxic cringe fandom off kid making cringe OCs
Ah yes of course i watch this when this has 69k likes
1:08, I'm sorry, IS THAT JK SIMMONS?!
This might get interesting
Cute lil robots with a taste for robo-blood? Sounds like a party!
The people who dislike this have one of the main symptoms of covid no taste
🤯
The fact that this releases in only 5 days
I want this, I need it, NOW! This looks so GOOD!!
This Is epic
A murder drone murdered a murder drone because the murder drone talked crap about grandma toaster.
You know this reminds me of
Ññññ
Looks good
fun fact: when n said he enjoyed the adventure one of his eyes was an x, meaning these "murder drones" could be advanced robots with a virus for making them thirst for oil so that means n as a selected murder drone had an anti virus but it only works half the time
Nier Automata, but your the mobs that you kill in the game.
0:20 the entire planet is about to suffer a catastrophic disaster in which trillions will die and those two are just like “Whelp”
I was going to make a Nier Automata joke. So yeah. This is basically Nier Automata without alien robots and magic stuff and I mean that in the best way possible. So yeah. Kidding, but seriously this is amazing.
*eyes almost screaming of seeing this masterpiece*
Ain’t this Interaction Cube by Liam Vickers?
it looks great but you gave away too much of the plot
I.....am......liam!!!!!!!!!
Member' when this channel just made stupid shitposts? Yeah i member'!
Pls do it now
bruh i'm waiting for so long
This thing its gonna be on HBO GO or Netflix? pls say yes!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I think I heard J K Simmons. He's gonna be in Murder Drones?! That's totally cool!
Just so much love for the animation channel. I can't wait to react to this
I liked how Uzi is teaching a class from how to fix their Murder Drone problem to "how to fix this in an overly complicated sci-fi way."
just awesome
This shit is netflix quality! (Thats good quality)
I have no idea why, but when I first saw this I thought it was a trailer for a game. It took about four rewatches before I realized the word pilot on the final screen
Kerem ereal 66
why does n have two voices?
Nuclear power plant: *RED ELERT* Humans: guess we’ll die.
no
FIVE MORE DAYS
Liams style looks kinda strange in 3d
Music almost hits just like Mario Galaxy’s did back in 2007.
so fucking hyped
Absolutely incredible how well these models capture Liam Vickers’ art style
“Booting up exposition” That’s my favorite joke here And this is amazing
wow I LOVE this concept.
This is for smg4
Holy crap it talks 0:58
Bro the details are insane! The clouds moving away from the explosion is probably on point with what would actually happen!
Can I make own murder drones :)
i wish this was a netflix show like prove me wrong it looks like it would be on netflix
Aight but whats the pilot gonna be on this looks great
this looks cool
That’s definitely a Liam Vickers monster.
I cann
I want to watch ths
HOLY CRAP THE GRAPHICS THIS LOOKS SO GOOD
Honestly, Murder Drones sounds like a banger Riddim/Dubstep song title
I'm here just because of liam.
N is basicially Cat Noir and Uzi is like Octavia from Helluva Boss
the only thing i like is that it's so smooth and 3D
cool
WAIT, THIS IS JUST SEA OF RUST BUT WAY BETTER?!
what software they used tho make this?
Наконец-то дождались 👍.
You're an awesome animator you should make a good movie like this
U should make a movie
"did you just hit me with that arm"  "holy crap it talks"
But what about ic_on cube
жду первую серию не стрепением
Almost here
The background music reminds me of the main theme of Portal 2.
looks promising, can't wait to actually see it
Its almost here bois.
I'm still a lil confused. Like, they say that the parent company doesn't like runways but the AI to kill the runways are also runways and also if the human race is dead, THEN WHOS THE COMPANY! If so then the company is also robots and they are trying to kill off them selves? IDK
I love it already
very interesting
N sounds like childe from genshin
Shadman go
Is it just me or dose the music have huge portal vibes
..........where can i get it?
This could make a really fun video game too tbh.
0:18 Seriously that no one noticed the VIBE=HARSHED joke?
1 mil views yay
*Cough* *Cough* *Rule 34* *Cough*
Bruh. Words can not describe how awesome this series is looking
🤖🔪💥🔫🤖 who wins
Это лудше чем Ацкий бос 🥰🥰🥰🥰❤️
I CANT WAIT FOR THE SHOW LOOKS GRATE
i like this WAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY more then the entire smg4 series
Congratulations on 1 million views!🎆
Dis look good
This art style... Cliffside?
Hi
It's OK if there isn't bit I'm hoping for atleast one smg4 easter egg
20th time watching this trailer
it feels like they are using the same models of decapitated heads but oh well this looks fun
Yeah, I can see this going big OvO
Ого
this looks like a game trailer
cmon bro u can not tell me this doesn’t look like a Liam vickers thing bro
This is going to be epic
OH SNAP U GOT LIAM IN ON THIS??
are we not going to talk about the "vibe=harshed" at 0:18
Me and my neighbor during midterms: 0:18
This looks like something out of a video game.👾🤖
I can see myself watching this full series
“Did you just slap me with that arm.” Best line ever
I am so hyped for this show.
1 week left!
This reminds me of madness combat
sad 1:21
I believe there are precisely 3 murder drones actually, as in every shot you can identify them via headwear- N has the flat hat, another has pigtails, and then we have the central one in most air shots that has “plainish” hair.
I really like this, i just hope it does'nt have the "AND EVERYONE GOT ALONG IN THE END" bs and atleast some more neutral ending planned like not havin everything be perfect after the end. just not something cliche everyone is good now whatever. With that out of the way.... i can't wait for this Probably Awesome (Series?) And i love the animation with 3D liam Vic. Characters.
I have a theory as to how this will go.  Since Uzi says "Our parent company doesn't like the concept of Runaway AI." I see it as a reason for the Murder Drones to go after the non-Murder Drones since they might be mistaken for AI Robots that have gone rogue and probably caused all humans to die even though the humans died on their own cause.  That's just my speculation.
i'm so exited for this show
The "Lowest body count eats a missile!" Mixed with the maniacal laughter just sounds so amazing to me! Whoo! HYPE!  Notice: I edited the quote to match as I've been corrected in the replies
I want an official soundtrack. This is something I could listen to on a daily bases.
This is giving me a extermination vibe of Hazbin Hotel
Please be a 24 episodes season
At this point it actually looks like a real show!
Vibe = Harshed
I really like how the shows kinda have a video game vibe with it
As much as I told myself I wouldn't ever watch murder drones,.  I'm definitely gonna
I just can't wait
c-can i watch it now?  (guess i'll just wait, like everyone... but damn this is so cool, don't want to wait)
Its already at 1 million wiews This will be one hell of a good show
So here is something funny I thought of Assuming the company programed the 3 laws of robotics into the worker drones, the creation of the murder drones in completely unnecessary as robot revolution would be impossible. They could just send humans to earth and start barking orders and the robots would obey. So the murder drones where a waist of resources.  Assuming the 3 laws weren't programed and robot revolution was a possibility. Think about this, they created an army of fully sentient robots with the specific purpose of elimination.  Mind you those fully sentient robots were created out of the fear of sentient robots revolting. I'm the only one thought about the problem with that logic  So in both scenarios humans are being humans and make really stupid decisions
voice acting could be better maybe probably animation’s great tho
This is a great! I hope you can make new series!  P.S. Hmm... Idk why, but the design of murderer drones is reminds me the design of angels from hotel Hazbin
Is this a video game or movie for teenagers?
wow this animation is EPIC!!!.Who made the animation
bruh i cant wait
when the trailer is better than any show youve ever seen
am i the only one who just realized N came out of some sort of ... pod
humanity is like "well its time to die i guess"
This is something we should be paying for.
oh ##### is too incredibe omg MARIO  merio siendo merio   i love your videos smg4
Why are all the murder drones female
Solution to stop murder drones MAKE MECHA GODZILLA
This looks sick can’t wait for the pilot
Very cool!
Me:crap it talks
Wow robot
1:05 can relate 😑
The people who disliked probably just couldn't handle how much of a masterpiece this is and how stunning the graphics are. They probably got nightmares bc it looks so real
The people who disliked have probably never seen a masterpiece
SNG4 HOW do you fine the Best anime make sure you are going to like I am waiting for the video  I WELL GET YOU 4 M SUBSCRIPTION that video O baby is going good
7 days
LoL
Now I actually liking the ANIMATION. Ayo I'll be waiting
Well I got a show to binge watch multiple times
Only 8 days until movie yay
I have no words to describe how good this is
N: "Everyone tells me I'm useless and terrible."  Also N: *crushes head with vicious intent* and *pulls out massive projectile weapon* in a not useless way. Me: Wow, everyone has really high standards.
Почему у этих роботов убийц одежда похожа на зимнюю форму командира во времена СССР/2 мировой? :()
Here's a theory. The orange light on N's head is a memory malfunction, that's why he's not attacking Uzi. I say this because the other Murder Drones (Take V for example) all their lights are yellow, N is the only Murder Drone to have the orange light and if you look closely at the end of the trailer, all of N's lights are yellow again. This makes me conclude that N will be mostly good throughout the series and will go back to full Murder Drone in the finale or as cliffhanger in the second to last episode. But hey, that just a theory, A Film Theory. Thx for reading. If this comment gets removed that means I'm right. (Edit: According to N's wiki page, he is just extremely merciful unlike V and J, that's why he isn't attacking Uzi. Hell, he even wants to introduce Uzi to the others according to the wiki and the Meet The Team clip.)
This is really interesting and cool, I cant wait to watch it!
i farted
I think it would be better as a game ngl just my opinion tho.
I seriously hope this is like a 40 minute pilot, at least 40 minutes.
Bro Oct 29th is the same day the new Mario party game is coming out
Hermoso, aunque siento que un pequeño edit a las voces, volviendolas un poco más robóticas siento que lo hubiera hecho perfecto.
if you have done murder drones why you countinue cliftside
how the bots survive tho
What that so cool smg4
Lets fucking go 😎
Time to do some fan art ladies and gentlemen
Oh my goodness, This looks amazing, I am definitely going binge watch this.
0:45 "that is so not the vibe!"
So worker drones are get kill by the murder drones?
Am I the only one who has this remind me about the animated movie "9"
I cant stop watching dis
Can't wait
Fun fact almost every animation that glitch make is a girl
Terminator’s family is here, *and they’re not happy after their brother died.*
“What have our parents done in the past forever while those things build a spire of corpses” So are the murder drones not their parent company?
Ok look. I’m just as impatient for the pilot to come out as everyone else is. But like… what if it was delayed by… I dunno maybe 2 days? Hm? Just a suggestion…
Can`t wait to see it,and omg the 3D looks so wild!!!!!! 😃😃😃😃😃😃
The thing is that the purple bot sounds like Jaidenanimations
o:55 ... Did u just slap me with that arm? 0:58 holy crap it talks
we are worker drones autimitist robots helping humans behind excol planet
CALM DOWN AND GAZE A LITTLE WIDER. LOOK AT THE LOVELY WORLD I'VE MADE UP HERE! LET ME INJECT SOME LEMON CIDER. PLEASE DON'T BE FIRGHTEND. CHILD DISSOLVE YOUR FEAR!
How to defeat murder drones step.1 : download malwares step 2.smack them a sledgehammer step.3 Press Alt+F10 thn here you go you defeated it
Pls have subtitles, pls have subtitles, pls have subtitles
Mr "so not the vibe!" is the best character
I have a fun theory that will probably be debunked before the pilot even airs: Uzi is either A: Actually a Murder Drone, which would explain her  brave though violent behavior while the other worker drones seem to be somewhat cowardly and peaceful. B: has a malfunction in her software that causes her behavior that surfaced some time before humanity killed itself, the "Parent Company" could have attempted to fix it but was unable to before they died, which would explain her animosity toward them. Or C: the Parent Company purposely built her the way she is because they were already planning on creating the murder drones, meaning that she is a early Prototype. I don't know a lot about technology, but electronic-based products tend to go through multiple versions before being sold to the public, so the current design of the Murder Drones could be the result of wanting to make them more intimidating.  Something else I noticed: alot of the worker drones seem to be male, while a lot of the murder drones (that I can see) seem to be female.   Also, a major plot point could be how neither Uzi nor N entirely fit in alongside their fellows. From the trailer, Uzi seems to be the only one among the worker drones who is actually prepared to fight the Murder Drones despite them possessing superior abilities while N seems to be the only Murder Drone who possesses any feelings besides bloodlust.If the Murder Drones are supposed to be heartless killers while Worker Drones are laborers, neither of them entirely fit the mold.   A couple of things could easily debunk this theory:   1: if Uzi is a murder drone, she doesn't possess the same colors. (MDs all seem to have silver hair , scissor fingers, yellow eyes/lights, and syringe like scorpion looking tails. Uzi has Purple hair and Eyes, No scissor fingers, and has no tail)  2: Aside from the beginning of the trailer,  Uzi shows no visible signs of malfunction or damage. N has a single red light on his head and his face displays the word "error"in his first appearance, while Uzi doesn't show a red light and the ERROR appeared in her normal color.  3: AI in sci fi literature is often depicted to develop its own personality over time, which seems to be the case with these drones. So Uzis behavior could simply  by sheer coincidence become more violent over time normally.  4: it's just a cartoon and I'm looking into it too much for no reason.  I hope you enjoyed my theory!
Did I only recognize Cliffside style of animation?
60 more views to 1 MILLION
why does this feels like those early youtube animated shows project that had 2 episodes and nobody ever talked about it again? not saying it seems bad, it looks amazing, just feels like one of those
I have a question when this coming out i need to buy this as a DVD NOW 🔫🙂 because my simp level is increasing very fast so u should start running because once I start Simping there’s no turning back :)

you can't build a spire of corpses when you blow up half the planet. XD
This is coming out on my birthday
Is the main character in this trailer voiced by the same person who voices Sophia in Meta Runnerm
I'm excited for the real show
Finally, something that actually looks extremely promising rather than the dissapointment that is Modern Smg4 and the waste of production time that was Sunset Paradise, this actually looks on par or even better than Meta Runner!! Its about time glitch got their act back together, this looks amazing.
OMG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
When is released?
https://youtu.be/aTSN0kJSZoo
Music gives me portal 2 vibes

I have watched this 10 times now help me.
WOW 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩 I’m so exited for it to come out keep it up 🥳
You should make fantasy animated series based on the bestsellers like The Last Unicorn the Lost Journey, the Eyes of the Dragon, East of the Sun and West of the Moon, the Princess Bride, Eragon, etc.
Is the one talking at the beginning of the trailer the main character?
reminds me of toonami
The pilot will be released in the same day as my birthday 🎂🥳🎉🎈🎁🎊 YEIIIII
The art and models remind me of sonic, the big eyes and head, to the small bodies and the cartoonish but serious tone just in the characters, while looking awesome at the same time, (can’t wait)
Why are they so cute
man i just want meta runner season 3
is it me or the person at 1:00 sounds like someone of heard
Please make it soon!!!!!!!!!!!!:)))))
Wow an entirely original series, unrelated to smg4. Looks amazing.
Hey does anybody know when the next IC-0N will be released?
Gado vai lasa
Next squid game
What's a exoplanet
Finally. Something that isnt squid game
9 days!!!!!!!
Wait so "our parent company didn't like the idea of run away ai" didnt she just say humans were wiped out? And last I checked drones are supposed to obbey orders? So a drone can't get a Lower rank drone to do what he/she likes becuse they Dont have the human administrator    Also somehow I disliked it when I first whatched the trailer (like the dum dum I am, youtube can't touch me now) and gave it the like it deserves
If this doesn't get a second season I'll be very disapointed.
is that michael kovach
I've watched this too many times.
this looks intersting
To many flash scenes but I would say your little trailer is as good as" jurassic bark"(and I mean it when I say that)
1000000000000000000/10
this looks freaking awsome
Can I hug one of The murder drones?
ive already named the 2 control panel dudes from the begining there names ar larry jared
Seems like this show is based on sound design and lighting, which especually the first are VERY important to a quality show.
cute and very proper
This needs to be a propper show, like on netflix
9 days left
This Looks like an Netflix Animation That will Come out soon
AHHHH I LOVE IT
SO WHO WANTS TO HELP ME KILL 480 PEOPLE FOR DISLIKING THIS

I love the background music. Sounds like a Game trailer.
there's already fan art and the show is 9 days from releasing the pilot, wow
My pingaz feels so happy :D
This is really cool and I will watch it, but what about s3 of meta runner
Looks like I'm going to need research on this...
УРРААаА ^^
Remember... THIS WAS MADE BY TWO BROTHERS THAT CREATED A SMALL TEAM AND SLOWLY BUILT BRICK BY BRICK TO THIS.
I swear this can be on par with squid game
the music reminds me of fireboy and watergirl for some reason
Imagine my comment get love by glicth production  ㅤ ㅤ ㅤ ㅤ ㅤ ㅤ ㅤㅤ ㅤ ㅤ ㅤ ㅤ ㅤ ㅤㅤ ㅤ ㅤ ㅤ ㅤ ㅤ ㅤㅤ ㅤ ㅤ ㅤ ㅤ ㅤ ㅤ*BUT NEVER*

This is pretty cool looking
whaooooooo
There is N and V. How many of you wanna guess the third one is S. For N V S envious.
Soooo this may be my 200th time watching this trailer
0:21 is my favorite part of the trailer lol, those two were just so chill at the fact they were 3 seconds from getting nuked XD
You made the trailer...... But you didn't make the episode's......... I'm disappointed........
What character does this relate in the smg4 universe 🤔  Mr monitor ?
i could think of a much better show idea
bruh just continue meta runner
holy crap it talks
This is actually awesome! Can’t wait to watch it
porfavor facao esse jogo pra celular!  eu vou ficar feliz se voces fizerem isso pra celular!
Uhhhh the murder bots design looks scarily the same as another artists, please don't tell me you stole someone's design
robot people when
Who voiced this
Yo why can't time just accelerate so I can watch the pilot already
bruh allay lookin kinda weird
Real happy to see they took many ideas from intercion cube. That should was to good to just leave behind and completely forget about.
I love the  *Error report . . . "Did you just slap me with that arm?"  "Oh my got it talked"
E
YEAAAAAA I’m so pumped for this I’m literally gonna pass out
My..... That looks cool
*N Not Forgets His Purpose* Others Drones: *Execute Order 66* You were suppose to destroy the worker drones not join them!
Is there going to be a movie I can't wait for a movie
9 daaaayyyysssss!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Smg4 make Mario movie

Liam Vicker's animation but it's A *WHOLE ASS SHOW, LET'S FUCKING GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO*
Can you make this a GAME?
Looks better than all of the other shows ngl
Woooow, loooks pretty fresh and cool🤩
i thoght i was a game
Y la MEGGY? Ouh es otra serie pendejo yo jeje
I see this and I think… Liam Vickers Animation?
Liam did it again.
I am totaly confused is this a game yt animation series or actual movie
I’ve watch this hundred’s of time’s and I still love it.
If I want to personally describe the synopsis of 'tis series, it is sort of The Omega Man with a hint of WALL-E.
I love that plot, thats a pretty good plot, how can you not like that plot "Its not like we revolted and killed all the humans or anything, because they handled that just fine themselves"
Too late
Watch them murder our favorite side Characters
The fuck, was that Travis Willingham voice I hear
This actually look awesome
As to give constructive criticism the trailers lack sound effects, and the part with the explosion felt stale and lifeless.
I just found out about this from someone mentioning it on Reddit, and dang it looks good! Eager to see the pilot!
Do no one else thinks about fire boy and water girl when you hear the music......        just me ok
YOOO CANT WAIT!!!!!!!!
Why in storys like this humans are always are idiots?
Ohh… my god…
Holy shit. A Liam Vickers story with GLITCH animations. I recognized Cordy's design immediately (Sorry if I butchered the name, I only remember that bit from when she talks to the flying... thing and Death itself.)
Wait is this a video game a show or a movie I have no idea
I have no idea who you are but, I am HYPED for the pilot in 10 days!
damn the female AI Is hot i think ill simp lol
The designs are cute, the lore....not so much
this deserves to be on netflix
Joke but the girl looks like Jaden animations
WOW
Pls make that murder drones movie
Ждёмс)
Bro the animation is smooth and sick
English Subtitles  [0:07 - 0:14] We are Worker Drones, Autonomous Robots helping humans mine exoplanets [0:14 - 0:18] Its not like we revolted and killed all humans or anything [0:18 - 0:23] mostly because they handled that just fine all by themselves.  [0:24 - 0:29] We finally had a future, Unfortunately [0:29 - 0:35] our parent company didn't exactly love the concept of runaway AI.  [0:35 - 0:37] "That's never gonna end up problematic.."  [0:38 - 0:43] "What have our parents done for the past forever while those things build a spiral of corpses?!" [0:43 - 0:45] "Its like we're waiting for an inciting incident" [0:45 - 0:47] "oh so not the vibe!"  WIP
Now that’s a nice project you got there, can’t wait for the rest it.
Awesome! And... Just to ask... When is Meta Runner Season 3?!? I want to know what's next!!!
Amazing!
..here come the oc's.. oh man
10 more days
xd it sys holy crap she talk
I now wanna get into voice acting for these animations and videos
This show does look ok but it’s NOT META RUNNER and that’s why I’m dissapointed
I like how when the scientist sees the core collapsed and they just like  Scientist 1:oh nvm its error we messed up Scientist 2:yeah,anywa- Explode  Also the planet core needs some entertainment bc it says vibe=harshed lol
you thought there was rule34 before wait til' this comes out :/
WHEN?!?!
OMG,Here Comes The ESRB Or My Age Clasification For My Reactions,¿Can I Use the 1ST Episode [When it realese]? In My Channel To React ?----JESRCompany-U.S
Why do they talk spanish
Alright nice good video
Yooo is that N2s VA?
Hello are you looking for any voice actors for any new characters? (Just asking because I would like to help)
Which part of YouTube did I just stumbled into and what is this?
Yep it needs to be a Netflix show
I’m super duper excited for this new show
Alright, who gave the Murder Robots the drip?
I CANT WAIT!
1:21 Famous Betrayel
please tell me the main charater is a BOY this time
Why you animation pls
Yes Yesssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss!!!!!!!!!!
Satisfaction of Robot Blood?
i wonder, if the 2 drones are the human and drone from the other series :| (my brain is just ded)
Yess a smg4 movie!
This WALL E reboot is way dark 😅
HD
I think I heard an actor from tales from the borderlands. Reece 🤔🤔🤔
This looks so cool
so what i have gathered the main character becomes friends with murder drone murder drone eventually becomes evil other drones die        DAYS LATER: so this about all happened on the first episode!
Looks epic. High expectations, hopefully won’t disappoint
Is this a movie or a video game? It give off major game vibes but it is made like a movie trailer so I don’t really know which it is but other way I love it.
0:17 is relateable
THIS IS SO COOL! (Considering I like robots)
Ok now what new chalacter.....
So, Humanity died because of a Harsh Vibe... understandable.
Oh yeah. this is gonna be good.
Add the muder drones to smg4
The amount of times I've rewatched this trailer is a testimony to how excited I am for this!
L think there muderer because there bad presone
Let there be Oil shed🤖🔪
Oh I can't wait to see the pilot. I'm HYPED for this :)
Season 2 be like  "We are Murder Drones, autonomous combat drones killing rogue AI for humans."
Madness combat be like
Is it just me or is the main robot gonna turn into a murder drone?
This is so cool
This is cute and terrifying at the same time
are humans actually still around? Because why would the Murder drones be killing the worker drones without human orders?
Can this just be realeased
So this is basically "curse your sudden but inevitable betrayal" but with robots instead of dinosaurs.
apparently iv'e been so starved for shipping content i can smell a ship from here
The drones looked so adorable that they can pull off murders smoothly and easily.
Murderer drones more like...... imposter drones well i think?
I love how where it says planet core collapse at the left it says and I quote "VIBE=HARSHED".
THIS LOOKS LIKE A GAME BUT A GAME THAT IS A MOVIE
0:23 ghidorah: finally after millions of years we took over the world
Basically Tari invented robots that basically caused this movie to happen  Jk that didn't actually happen
WHAT THERE PROBLEMS?!
Maybe this took like 3mounts
I'm really exited for this
This is amazing!!!
YES YES YES YES   Y  E  S happiness noises smile :)
Damn.. time can never move fast enough to keep up with my absurd rate of which I consume content.
Cmon u want watch the real

Well dang that was a killer trailer, music was pretty darn catchy too. Can't wait to see the show!!!
Gacha me: uhhhh could you obliterate...? Because I can  Real life me: bruh                                                My profile is a gacha character that I made so heck it
0:52                 E
1:18 That "I messed up" reminds me of that Text to speech shorts
i can't wait for this to come
Awesome!!
The part where it goes “so not the vibe” is as funny as my jokes
They should consider making a video game of this series, the concept, the music and the story look very good and interesting
can't wait to see this
This is awesome amazing Perfection this is gonna be good So excited
Most of the time this connects to smg4, but I don't see a connection
👍👍👍
excitement after watching sun set paradise about when it end
For now lets call Cerial Degination N -Noi- Liam
Whos staring this one?
Ok so if you think They're supposed to be metal *when where is the hair from.*
I N T R E S T I N G .
This will be amazing because, is dark, post-apocalyptic plot, it is made by Glitch (and that means by SMG4)
Plot twist  (One of the characters used to be human)  Yes it could happen
Woah this comes out on my birthday!
There is two things that I feel something we need to debunk 1º the pile of robot corpses that I feel like has some parts missing and don’t look like any of the robots that appeared and the hand with claws that looks like it is falling out like it is made with other robots parts
I haven't seen any other of there series but I want to see this
I can’t stop watching this
Imagine if mario was in this lol
Wasn't really planning on commenting anything. But you need all the support you can get. This looks amazing. So fucking hyped. (I'm also hyped for your other series, but something new by someone new sounds great!)
Awesome! Can't wait for it to come out.
YES!!!!!!
Don’t question the tail
This show is one of the few things that is keeping me going, thankyou to everyone making it
One of them sound like wholesome Noi from my inner demons / or aphmau
Im just waiting the first episode
hopefully there would be a character with humor/sarcasm
Can't wait for this, but where meta runner season 3
Cearl designation N kinda looks like a Russian in His outfit
I feel like part of it comes from the inspiration of Hazbin Hotel. The wings of those Murder Drones kinda reminds me of the Angels depicted in the Pilot episode.
This kinda reminds me of nier autamota
Is it just me or does the wings of the flying robots look like the wings of robloxia?-
This looks really cool
this is epik
Cool
Not going to lie this is series look hard
WELP I KNOW WHAT I’M WATCHING
THIS IS INCREDIBLE I LOVE CUTE THINGS THAT DESTROY EACH OTHER I CAN'T WAIT TILL ITS OUT AND DONE now I want to be a murder drone for Halloween
EPIC
Humans : *typically doing human stupid things* "guess we die"  Robots : "Guess we free now"
This is really smooth I didn’t think a funny YouTuber can do this
I love the 💀 🤠 emoji in the description
Me encanta, ponele traduccion plis
Ok
To quote green arrow from injustice that was spooky
So, uh Netflix? when are you greenlighting this? 🤨
THIS IS GONNA BE SICK
New? October 29
This is going to be epic!
What is this... feeling...? I haven't felt like this in a long, long time. The last time I felt like this was the beginning of 2020 when I discovered the Gwain series...  You've perked my curiosity and relit my intrigue. I think I'll be keeping an eye on this...
why is it like a disney movie film like im amazed
Pls make movie
I dont want wait
So ....... basically nier
Can't wait for it to watch.
I love it, because there's 3 things I like, violets, robots, and the furture
You didn’t give them the fucking oil.
I am confused is the boy a murder drone or are the parents murder drones? Either way looks really cool and interesting like the other shows glitch has made. Theses shows should not be on youtube because they could go on netflix or something just fine. They could easily pass as a certified show.
And how much power did you say you had? Well I think ITs OVER 90000!!!!!!!!!
blade wings are always a win for me
This is so good this needs to be on Netflix or Hulu
it’s surprising how auto generated captions is 99% accurate
Music in the background is fricking good. Does it have a link to the original music or can i have the name or can somebody please filter only the music out and make a 1 hour edition out of it?
Start Maker Video (This But Soon)
Im already very excited smg4, greta job on this and all of ur videos!
The true definition of "Cute, but deadly." This HAVE to be MUCH better than Sunset Paradise, or else I ain't watching.
this remineds me of clifside
Cool
HOLY SHIIIIT! WOW! This animation will be the best one in this year
It's kind a servire about a despotico future
0:56 that part sounds like noi.
Just add juggernaut robot and someone control it name Bob the janitor
I like to think that they thought of the killing part first and decided to make it robots so there isn't blood
This seems like its going to be EPIC! Can't wait for it to release.
12 days remaining
Gosh, I can't wait to listen to the OST! It sounds so fuggin cool!
This is very good I love it
HOLY SHIT
You lied to me that you made the murder drones it is just a trailer
its look nice
Be like: did u just slap me with that arm?
It will be a banger series
Well im hooked 😃😃😃😃😃😃
I likey.
Im a sucker for sentient robot movies! This is gonna be so awesome!
1:00 cool!
What a minute was that, Tim tom @ 0:44
The murder drones are very  cool looking, I actually want to mae my own murder drone
By the time I watch the first episode, the muscles in my legs will cease to help me walk. Probably. Oh yeah by the way This would all probably happen in reality’s future if earth committed not feel so good.
Adorable murder! And it's okay, because they're machines!
0:55 As soon as I heard that voice I knew it was Michael Kovach.
this trailer came out on my brothers birthday
0:55 is that male or female robot?
Looks cute.
I haven't seen much on the glitch channel cuz I just normal stuck to smg4 but I really like this and the song is really cool, I can already see this bein good when it comes out
Y'all should go watch Liam Vickers. He has great story animations and he's the one who created this storyline!
NO WE COULDNT SAVE THE BOYS NOOOOOOOO
every anime type shit you make is so fascinating
Yo it comes on my bday :D
Another Liam Vickers series to look forward to!
When the drones turn sus
The animation looks familiar
I wish this was on Netflix
The music sounds cool and I hope this series goes great 👍
Planet Core: oh noes, i ded.  Humans: "Ah, screw it."
oh its not internecion cube, lol dont know why i thought it was. im still looking forward to this though!!!!
Why is Jaiden animations leading a bunch of robots?
I know who help you guys make this
Epic its like star wars lol
500/100 I love the smooth animation❤👌
I don't have patience but I have to wait for the new series!
I'm excited to see this!
i feel like this is gonna be funny and sad rather than horror and funi
Ah, a planet where humans is ded and now only robots live and there are murder drones who eliminates all robot because the company didnt agree or whatever i dont know what is this movie
Its not even out yet and people already makin theorys
Huh the animation is very unique. Reminds me slightly of transformers prime, but a very shiny, slick, neon version.
I have the feeling some humans survived. But hey it's about drones killing eachother so if some survived it wouldn't be important for the story I think ...
love it
Pog
I like how those 2 humans just shrugged it off when they ended the world lol
Gotta say i love the dudes orignal videos (not glitch even tho i do like glitch shit since thats the only reason im subscribed lol but HE MADE SOME POPING SHIT)
I NEED MURDER DRONES (it cool)
Just use a gun :/
I can't stop watching this trailer it's amazing. Thank SMG4 and Liam
Meta runner season 3 anyone
Ok I already like it
nah i want mario pengas
When will it come out? This cartoon
Micheal Rosen would approve of this masterpiece
oooo i was wondering why the murder drones looked so familiar then i flund out the same peros. who made internecion cube is helping make this
one of my friends told me there was going to be a new Glitch productions Series so I came and saw this and it looks awesome
Animation has really evolved, a lot, and on the planet explosion you can even see how clouds deform, that is huge detail
"Did you just slap me with that arm" "Holy crap it talk"
Basically yellow bad purple green and blue is good
Just think halfway through they find something they can't kill and one of them who is too genocidal starts to have a meltdown
The trailer Its good
if this is a real game i will play it
Why does the jock drone just die
dang this looks cool
I can't wait to watch it
This looks hilarious and lime it could be gorey
OH ME GO
why is this a literal movie please try adding this to the cinema
oh my god im so scary
reminds me of internection cube
I'm just gonna keep this comment here because this whole thing reminds me of something else but I don't know what it is.... Hmmmmmmmmm
Yo I didn't know this was Glitch Productions until I looked at the channel ☉_⊙
I want to listen to it forever
Can Music from of this video????? This video is just super. I'm bad with English, I'm from Russia
I think this will be the best one out of all the story is wacky, unique and will have very funny momentos but its still capable to get serious
it will something to do with intersection cube?
The fact that there is already rule 34 of this is astonishing
This seems really interesting, exited to see what comes out of this series.
when i said wake me up for meta runner season 3 i didnt know that this masterpiece was going to be announced
Please tell me that there are a couple of drones made by furries that are literally protogens. *this is the perfect opportunity to do so* *don't disappoint the furry community*
“Everyone tells me im useless and terrible.” welp there goes me in a nutshell
Cool
Finally! Some... wait... Blood?.. Oil?... Carnage! from the Trailer I've just seen there, it's a quite solid concept and I HOPE will get past the Pilot. This is just too good.
Damn the artsytle looks insane super fire
The Drones are very cute. and murders.. well they cute anyways.
COOL Cant Wait!!!
Cereal designation n is cool
The boy murder drone has a voice that's sounds like Noi from the youtuber aphmauu
holy shit its fucking amazing
Wait a minute where I see that  Geo Exe?
Cant wait👍👍🔥
Holy Moly :o
Love the wing design. You can really see how the first joint of it was inspired by second joint of praying mantis limbs. For that matter also how the feather blades of the second joint of the wing was inspired by the third joint of praying mantis limbs. Either derivatively or convergently.
YES POGGGGG
Murder drones really reminds me of Stikbot Off The Grid lol
Gime content of this now my Brain is mentely parylized until i see a seson of this
Just in this trailer you could tell that the murder droid or something went back to the bad side lol
New show: Exists Girl in show: Also exists  R34 artists: Oh yeah, it’s all coming together
Miss input
It seems more like a movie than a series
Being a very big fan of Liam Vicker and Smg4 this is a dream come true!!
Murder Drones looks like an actual company worked on Stick bots off the gird
Holy shit im getting major half life 2 vibes
Is it just me or does the murder drone sound like angel dust from Hazbin Hotel?
It looks great
This looks so epic!!
they remind me sonic characters for the eyes display and the mouth style
Liam: said murder drones are robot vampire things. Luke: said it cute little robot that murder each other. Me: what
🤖
When u know u gonna have epik   dreams
I'm so excited for it, also having jess voice the main character us just epic!
Smg4 + murder robots = 👍🗿
Why do I love Murderer Drone's soundtrack so much
Where can we watch this on when it comes out
man! I can't wait! this is gonna be so epic! I already know that I am going to love this! After all, I love your work on both channels❣
Just from seeing the trailer I know it gonna be good you better make it be good and don’t end it so quickly like sunset Paradise
I can’t wait for it to come out I eager to watch it
That guy:” that is so not the vibe”  Me: *Y E S*
I am really exited till the day episode 1 comes out!!!!!
why do some of the murder drones give me I.C-0n vibes?      if you get that, you have my respect
Humans: _Imagined that the drones won't do anything stupid like killing eachother_ Also humans: _Goes extinct_ Drones: _Starts killing eachother_ Also humans, again: _Inhales_ *Am I a joke to you?*
The fact that you guys aren't streaming this on television is mind boggling for how good this looks.
This Kinda looks like transformers and I love it and I would ship n and uzi.
i wonder if there will be any human survivors?
Thats suit for Halloween costumes.
Looks perfect for this 🎃
Hype
The second I saw that name "Liam Vickers" I knew what I was in for lmao
Wow I can’t wait to see this!
Please is sonic exe
Epic.
Sin duda alguna me va encantar este piloto, ya espero se sea rápido el día 29 para verlo. Without a doubt I will love this pilot, I hope it will be quick on the 29th to see it.
please make the vid!
was it portal? or doctor who? or something else?
Love it so good
wait ive heard that music before
this show is going to be 10/10
This looks more interesting than the other stuff on this channel I actually might watch this one
THE LORE IS SO HEAVY
😮
Me likey
If Devil May Cry was an animated series about robots, it'd be this.
The Murder Drones look like the Exterminators of Hazbin Hotel.
Am i thrilled about arch style robots? Yes....now im going to hump some speghetie...
hey GLITCH i thought of my own murder drone, his name is corruption, a broken deadly murder drone
:000
DO IT
0:21 guess we’ll die
Everyone in school be like: AUGHHHH The boy: GOODBYE
cant wait to see how this new sires go so COOL!!
Ok thats cool
It looks so good!!!
Subtitles: “luis body count its a Mitchel           Edit : Who’s here before ep 1 I know I am.
still waiting for meta runner season 3
dang this looks sick can't wait
I've watched this 20 times already
Welp what a nice new traller
I’m gonna nutt
Humans died by themselves and not by the robots, something new,  very nice
Wow im impressed
cant waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaait
Something tells me this is gonna be VIOLENT
Cool ig
Amongus but its battle royal
please tell me there are human survivors also roaming around please tell me that i can see atleast one human in back round PLEASe
tbh this looks cool and im not even halfway done
The Trailer is pretty good 😃
I've actually want to learned more about this series, I know that this will awesome ^^
sussy
is this a sign for a new SMG4 character?
I honestly hope uzi becomes a smg4 character like Tari, she seems perfect for it
SOMEONE PUT THIS ON NETFLIX
I only recently learned what exoplanet meant. Talk abt convenient timing
Yes
Looks amazing!
nice
Never heard of this channel before, I thought this was a movie trailer when I first saw it
This has to be the 50th time I’ve watched this.
GOOD animation
This will be E P I C.
This looks cool
13 days
Serial designation N. Let's call him Nigel or maybe Noi
Can't wait for the pilot. Looks interesting!
выглядит как имба
I've been waiting a week when is the first episode going to come
https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzAUj5DNHXSkV2jxoRVVlyohxphQK-S9R
Ok...........that was good I don't ever sub to 2nd channels but I'm gonna subscribe 😃
God I love seeing Liams stuff in 3D. It feels like it fits the slightly cartoonish and goofy side of this while perfectly capturing the terror stuff.
Okey I love Liam's 2D style more.But this will be a great show
I feel like ive seen animation something like that somewhere but I forgot the name
At the fhalf way: ngl, so f cliche  At the end: waw, nice, I'll consider watching it
Something tells me that one of the murder drones is going to befriend the protagonist then leave dramatically then swoop in to save the day
YOOOOOOO  But meta runnee season 3 woidld be cool too
The quality and the design of the killer Robot is so awsome
Pls no cringe fanart and fanfic i hope this series turns well and doesnt get ruined by children
OH this is cool!!!
Saw this trailer... Looked at the designs for a while. Started to think to myself "Hey wait, this really looks like that animation series I've been watching over the last couple years..." *does a quick Youtube search* *Sees it's by the same guy*  "You sunova bitch I'm in"
Ah! I thought I saw some Liam Vickers in the character designs. Nice work, mate.
Maybe there will be teh new gang of SMG4
có phụ đề nha
0:23 ye that sounds about right
This film has strange vibe.....
Holly shoot starts with Mario 64 to a amazing 4K hi everything show :D
Idk getting fallout vibes
Okay maybe I am mistaken, but doesn't the voice that says "you lead a murder drone here!" Kinda sound like the pharaoh from yugioh or is that just me?
God, that voice acting is honestly awful...
This is gonna be epic
LETS GOOOOO
When he says "Did you just slap me with that arm?" I suddenly relate to him. (In a way.)  "I always try my best." Sounds like me, if i was a murder bot.
0:20 welcome to the destroying mankind as we know it club
This should be a fucking movie
Is this a game or a movie???
Alright, I am tired of people confusing Murder Drones with the AI's, first the Murder Drones are the robots with some yellow glowing parts on them, the reason why they are called "Murder Drones" is they are flying robots that are ment to kill the AI's because the AI's were ment to mine exoplanets not do whatever they wanted to do. Second, the humans were the ones who created the AI's so the humans could move to different planets if earth were in any danger.
ok but like HOW AHAHAGHGAHGAHGAHGAH omg this is perfect im losing my mind over this concept  Edit: and how did you slip a sus joke in there
Why did I think this was a game trailer for some reason???
I can't wait for this series
Hello my pc  Bye my pc
CAN"T WAIT
Well I am so interested in this.
Pog .O. yesssss 0:56 .o. noi?  Or voice of blue or Mr Amazing va?  (Sorry xD who else thought of that 0:42 Idk about this but it kinda reminded me of pacman scene or idk
EXTREMELY EXCITED
This movie is going to be a blast
confusion: is this a movie or a series of videos as a show
N reminds me of Charles from Henry Stickmin
*SPOILERS*  You don't need to read this, it's a spoiler for the characters name and it will spoil you and everyone! You need to wait for the pilot episode to come to know the names of the characters:  Uzi - the protagonist N - the sidekick V - the antagonist J - another protagonist Khan - the protagonist's father  Took it from the wiki
I love it
of all the characters, I think I already like the murder bot that gets slapped... let's wait :)
nice...          but when is the next meta runner coming out? sorry...
It would be better if it was more gruesome
So one of the key things was humans “mostly” handled that, this leads me to believe there may still be life left on well, whatever planet were on
I was kinda hoping for this to be survival bullet hell game but I will enjoy this.
"that's never going to end up problematic"
Okay this new mini series is going to be pretty bloody
Another series of meta runner please
Dang I cannot wait and I'm subscribing so I won't missed it
Honestly I think I already found my favorite character serial destination N
I can't wait For Murder Drones!
Animation style looks neat. Didn't really get the story from the trailer, no classes or anything just seem like they raging. I mean humans are dead, just seems like gender
Dam this look👌
Fun fact the drones are based off of the first version of tari that was sketched by Luke’s sister
you know this would be a badass game too
Omg the best trailer
This kind of seems familiar ........................................ AMONG US !
How can this have this QUALITY and don't inmediatly have millions of views
If there is also romance somehow, I'll not be surprised, because the fandom always finds a way
Very cool!  Please, updates on where to watch it if it’s not on YouTube!
Can't wait
Oh damn, it's acually really promising 😳
Looks really good! Love the designs of the robots! <3
EVERY. LEVEL. OF. YES.
Can someone explain me how they have hair?
YYYYYYYYYYYYEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
When is this coming out?
Interesting. . .
my hype meter is at 100% overload
looks great
nofboysmbolwrjgorwjgorwjgojnginřhý5
I can’t wait! Just like I can’t wait for a third season for meta runner to be announced!
Bruh the humans pulled a 2020 and a 2050 at the same time. I don't know wether to be disappointed or impressed that they managed to fuck it all up in such a short amount of time
When i hurt is definitely Michael Kovacs
soo what about the background music?
this is giving me mad spiral knights vibes
This thing is going to need a kill count
I really wanna see this move it look so cool
Liam vicker is a amazing animator but I am kinda dissapointed how its not 2D, what makes liam special is his 2D artstyle, but this? You can see the exact same style and textures in any other 3D studio (I wasnt saying it gonna be a bad movie, just thinking the 2D artists should stop making their movies 3D. There a very wrong idea in animation community about how 3D is more “modern” and “professional” :/
I feel like murder drones has some sort of thing to do with Internection cube (mostly of the Icons) because just look at the murder drones style of opening their wings and creating their hands into sharp claws
can't wait
I've been waiting for this unholy man to get on a project like this ever since Cliffside. Now he can spread that sharp-toothed psychopath smile he loves animating so much to all corners of the internet, as it should be.
this is gonna be excellent, just wait.
I'm really excited
Its not game, right?
FINALLY AFTER ALOT OF TIME        WE GOT MORE SERIES
Can you made the full video on this one pls about murder drone pls
I know there's no humans in the trailer, but is there at least survivors (if the computer chips in the drones work, so do can humans)
O good I thought I was going to need to wait 5 years for it to never come out
why is it taking so long before it is 29. i can't wait
hey~ quick lil question. Since i'm loving this animation so much and wanna support it would you mind if a small time youtuber gave it a shout out?
I have never been more hyped for a show more than in my life. Especially when my boy Liam is involved!
I need this
this looks amazing, Im looking forward to watch this
0:21 Guess I'll die.
I really hope the series will have a semblance of the darkness from the "original"
the drone. so not the vibe
0:18 ayo bro you know how fix this? nah man i dont kno-    I C A N T W A I T F O R TT H E P I L O T E P I S O D E !!!!
The voices and animation are amazing! I can't wait to watch the pilot!
Me:Did You Slap Me With That Arm? My Sister:Holy Crap It's Talk's
Internecion sequel? Do want.
I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THIS ON NETFLIX
1:03 he sounds a bit like Sonic
Cant wait
FACT: Why do robots/drones go to school if they can just downloud all the info?
So it is about robots that were working for humans who aren’t there anymore, and the company that “owned” the robots now wants to terminate them so they don’t roam freely?
Looks great can’t wait.
This looks exactly like something Liam would make.
But hey, I looked at some Wiki page that one of the characters are voice acted by Elsie Lovelock who did Charlie's singing voice and Michael Kovach who did Angel Dust from Hazbin Hotel and also Michael Kovach appeared in all of the Hunicast with Ashley and Ed. #OhAshley!
Interesting 🧐☕
so unions for AI's odd but intriguing
This so good. Creative way to animate this story ark.
So basically,spiral knight but futuristic war
remember these are THE SAME people that made mario's pingas stuck in the door
ААААААА, КАУ ЖЕ Я ЖДУ КОГДА ОНО ВЫЙДЕТ!!
Aye looks rad
imagine if they added the Terminator
Dudeeeeee
2222 July 19 the murder drones incident
THE KING HAS RISEN TO DO MORE UNSPEAKABLE THINGS
Get ready for cliffhangers every episode
Can't wait
0:20 yep, that's about what I would do in that situation
How many episodes will this have
NOBAMYA IS DEAD. DRONEBANYA LIVES
Can't wait!! Looks incredible
I personally think that this would be a great game
yes
Liam is a writing genius
I'm excited
Man as soon as I heard “murder drones” on smg4 and I usually don’t watch this channel but this just made me say yup I’m watching this
Wow!!!!!!!!!!!!🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳💯🔥💥🤯⭐⭐⭐
1:00
Hey, uhh, what are the murder drones’ names for uhh    “absolutely no reason”
PWEH...        I endured.
Dunno why but I feel the slight resemblance of the murder drones to the hazbin hotel angels exorcist especially with the one X mark eye. Whoa I just noticed that the murder drone seems to come from a white glowing planet to which heaven in hazbin is like a white glowing planet.
Amazing trailer
This looks good to be honest
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU
Yeah un nuevo proyecto, ojalá esté dure más tiempo jaja. Lo espero con ansias y si es subtitulado al español sería genial 😱
What country just got deleted from existence by that explosion
Where is the Portuguese subtitle of the meta runner's first season movie?
Now I want it out now! Amazing!!
that looks insane i cant wait to watch it
Wow this video has more views then episode 6 of meta runner season 2
*loads my gun* I’m going bot hunting
I really want this to be a thing. I feel like I have seen this type of art style before I wonder where.
I'm actually super hiped for this series, only two weeks to go guys lets go
This should be a TV show
Omg! Amazing Concept for a awesome series!
OBAMA BE PRAISED
Grab your popcorn, turn off your phones and take a drink. Lay back in yours seats, the appealing visuals will begin.
Ow the Edgy:the Series
AWESOME
Liam Vickers is an amazing artist, and I can’t wait to see his creations but with more budge put onto it.
I’m liking this so far!👍
I laughed at the bit where one of the human scientist just shrugged his shoulders and went 'Oh well, time to die'
I'm going to be honest, I think Liam vickers pulled some inspiration from his Internecion cube animation series for this, and it looks awesome
The music really reminds me of PORTAL
This is going to be the best show EVER.
OMG I can’t wait for this to come out
please oh god make this reality and let this continue THIS HAS SO MUCH POTENTIAL
Oh this looks so good
I can’t wait!!!!!
Is it just me or the trailer music sounded like Whisk’s theme at the end?
How is this made from SMG4? THE MEME GOD?
The only cause me to wacht it is for the date it will came out on 29 wile my brth is on 30 LOL
Bbq is one thing but cbq is something else  CyBorQue
Yesssss this looks sick!!!!!
oh thats cool
I subscribed.😇
Am I only Russian that waiting for it to come out?
One Word: AWSOME
man i live the way this looks, plus i'm already loving N. but is it just me or does the main female bot looks like Octavia from helluva boss?
Please, hope it would have Spanish substitute, because it seems like it will be a great show
Like Movie Wall-e
Why do these robots have hair?       I will never understand hentai.
Daj mi to oooooooooooooooooooooooooo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I i its, EPIC!
Liam must have fun with this.
The murder drones look like the E.M.M.I from Dread but more cute
You know this show is gonna be good when Liam is in on this
Good to know Earth is alright 👍
I love how the humans shrug “well I guess we will just die”
*please mordr groins*
so humans did a chernobyl to the entire planet.
squid game:
i like thier faces
I can't wait
Who else thought this was a videogame at first?
Wait... HOLD UP!     MY BIRTHDAY IS ON OCT 29
Bruh before this project was made i already had this robot designs in my mind for the future of my you tube channel... is it a coincidence or what?
cool a looking like cliffside project
I wish I’m in there
This doesn’t look like a show it’s a goddamn movie
I think I heard sonic's voice.
yup, this is it.Bois,ramp up the hype train,were going for a ride
I will wait impatiently ...
fuck robots Butlerian jihad now
5th time I’ve rewatched help
This actually reminds me of Funke
Ooooooooooooooooooooo
i have watched this over 20 times
i love the wings desigh and I can't wait
POG
This is gonna be good
Yo we gettin that background song anytime soon?
Interest has been piqued. See you on debut
Wow!  The animation was very good.
Every Single Character in this show is Waifu Material.
i want more retro music like this one or the ost  anyone know more music like this?
Mom can we have little nightmare and undertale in sci fi version? we had little nightmare and undertale:
Watinggg
Serial designation N  is best boi; change my mind
Well we gona have a replacement for samsung girl, R34 artist, WE GETTIN BUSY TOOOOOONIGHT
Заебись, молодцы ребята
This look so SICK I can't wait for it to drop :D
I'm not even gonna be suprised if they make a movie or something.
May you have a bright karma!Happiness to you!
nooo i dont want this. We dont want this. WE WANT META RUNER
Im so waiting for the moment SMG4 creates:     *If Mario was in Murder Drones* Edit: wow 90 likes thanks, maybe smg4 might notice this and make this a thing Edit 2: Wow i just watch the Murder Drones pilot, and I just watched the trailer and it turns out the trailer is literally the entire pilot episode-
Sweet!  Moar indie studios to rise up!!  Bring me moar!!! 😄😆😂🤣  Here’s to hoping that YouTube doesn’t try to destroy this before it can rise up.
Is this game?
Can't  wait  see what happens.
why?
this rated r
To think that half or more of the VAs do voices for hazbin hotel
Ïïœ
Trailer music kind of reminds me of Wheatley's theme from Portal 2: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOXrgDDLpYw
IDK why but it gives me Gwain Saga vibes so Im hype
Love how the show broke off the "machines revolting and killing humans" cliche and instead had the humans kill them selves by oofing the planet core
Looks sick. Looking forward to it.
6 days after this releases is my birthday
So this is xj-10
I love the art style, the voices, the setting, the animation, and the music. Can’t wait for the 29th to come.
All I can say is ........ YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!
I cant wait for the realsese
Looks kinda like something mdotstrange would make but like way more sane
Ok I'm all in for this! Animation looks good, It's weird which is my cup of tea Because Tea is Weird bro. And now I'm craving Gun fire
Though this isn't my type of humor I'll at least give the pilot a chance, the setting is interesting
I have a theory. In the fight between Uzi and Serial Designation N, Uzi hits SDN at some point which causes him to have an error and now he's now more of a friendly version of what he was and wants to be a good robot and that's why he has a red spot on his headband of yellow spots and at some point during the ambush we see later in the trailer the other Murder Drones fix him and that's why all spots I mentioned earlier are all yellow again and why he attacks and says “I really enjoyed our time together,” as he knows that he is going to turn back into a murderous phyco again implied by the laugh at the end of the trailer as it does sound like SDN. Or he was faking his nice act from the start but then grew attached to Uzi which makes him feel regret.
this is gonna be your biggest show yet can't wait
omg omg omg omg omg omg omg omg
c o o l                       https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ
“Did you just slap me with that arm?” “Holy crap it talks”
Everyone always tells me I'm useless and terrible  Same, serial designation n, same
Seems great, i look forward to watching this
What I can't wait for when the show comes out: Murder Drones merch If Mario was in Murder Drones Murder Drones sfm models (Possibly a Murder Drones game)
Wow this trailer really hits the spot!
So on the same day as my birthday- awesome!
I think this is a sonic oc🥴
Reminds me of the Brave Animated Series on Netflix
Well at least it's not five nights at freddy's
HOLY SHIT THIS IS IMPRESSIVE, like this is beyond movie quality impressive, I can't wait to watch all of this
Que joyon merece doblaje latino
This comes across to me like the counterpart to The Mitchells vs The Machines... and I'm here for it!
Happy for Liam!
Imma just come out and say these are probably my favorite designs for any robot characters in ANYTHING I've seen in a while. Liam Vickers is one h*cking legend.
This looks so good it should be in theaters or something!
finally a serious thats original and not a show about your own characters like meggy or tari
Very interesting.
Give me now
Fucking Sick
0:15 Look, a Venezuelan XD
Let’s just be prepared for r34 of the murder drones. BUT WHY WOULD ANYONE DO THAT?
People think Hazbin hotel is good… time to prove them wrong
This actually looks like a really good show that can be on Netflix
This reminds me of Protogens! Idk y tho
Say YESHHHH if ur Excited for the show when it comes out and the murder drones look cool
For a moment I thought this was a game
The 29th is my birthday
I wait him with excitations
I find the trailer very addictive I keep watching it
Comming out on my brothers birthday yay
this looks fantastic! I cant wait to see it!
Why do I feel like this is a kid version of terminator
i just like how the person just shrugs before they got wiped out
Very excited!!
Hmmm new smg4 character
This looks amazing! Great job to everyone!
Show is on my calander
consider the other me I n t e r e s t e d
Literally 2 days before spooky day
Cute destructive violent psychopathic postapocolyptic goodness, I'll give it a shot
OMG CANT WAIT FOR A EPISODE TO COME OUT
me and my homie: we fucked up in the nuclear company* also me and my homie: 0:21
B r u h
Me: I won't ge emotionaly con... Some robot: That's so not the vibe! Me: Well fuck!😠
I'm waiting for this 😀
They only time I’ll accept anime body proportions.
¿WHY HAVE I SAW THIS 20 TIMES THIS WEEK?
_Finally,_ a series where the robots don't extinct humans and instead the humans extinct  themselves :D

What really happend humans were using the powers core and it collapsed beacuse we didnt kmow what were doing then the other planets were collonised and sent backup to stop the work bots and evac eny humans left aka NONE so sleep well also thie will happend billions years in the futre
Super hyped up for it, a fresh idea for a new show about ''robots killing robots''. Cant wait for it (Yes i can wait for it)
Oh no. The planet failed the vibe check.
I tried to get N and Uzi on Akinator and I got: For Uzi: Tari & Another one I forgot For N: Spamton and *A CHARACTER FROM KILLER BEAN.* (WTF Akinator?)
Yes.
1:12 Thad is DEAD
damn, if the purple robot girl (i guess it's will be the main character) had zone-tans voice it would be great as heck, but also probably demonetized, heh
Epik dron killa lool
Fun fact:We only see 3 the same murder drones, The friendly one is the one with the hat and the other 2 have their hair different.
If the world's most capitalistic robot company's CEO was a weeb:
Im new here and i already like it. Free sub <3
I love the part where they say     Did you just also me with that arm Holly crap it talks
2 weeks
Honestly, I’m a interested to see how the worker drones feel about humanity now, especially the female…
A bit of the character design reminds me of Gwain Saga. Looks fun.
*somewhere in Nevada*
Trailer come out all ppl yeah the trailer is more better then the sunset movie
yo the pilot is coming out on my b-day
Somehow i believe this is gonna be a huge hit.
Fan story LOG III Murder drone conversation "Hahaha! That's the last of em here, let's go!" "Make sure there are no survivors MURDER DRONE IV (serial designation end)" "Yes ma'am!" "What the- agh!" "What the-! They can fight back!?" "Finish em off!"
Finally, the correct type of drone!
Why fi i hear boss music
Did I just spoil the whole show for me by watching this?
Why is this exactly what I hoped to see from glitch one day
Killer drones not murder
Mf went from dumb mario doing dumb shit to this.
'pulls up conspiracy sleeves'.   KAY. here is my theory right now. The murder drones re building the spire of corpses for the purpose of trying to laeve the planet, cause they don't want tobe left behind. Ends up leading to a truce between the weapons and the worker bots.   The exact motivations though is the big question. Either A, they have gone totally rogue ai and want to kill their creators. Or b, they want to go home.
Eh, if they keep murdering each other like that, they'll just destroy the world again like what the humans did before them. Ironic isn't it?
It feels like a movie lol but AM SO EXCITED
we are worker antonomous robots
0:46 Eyy it's Liam Vicker's voice!  A few days later after watching Liam Vicker (who created this) I gotta say, y'all should go watch Liam Vickers. He has great story animations and he's the one who created this storyline!
Cute little robots killing themselves for no reason that sounds like a good idea
Robots: horrorfied  Youtube captons: Applause
so the concept is AI robots finally deciding to not do their job because humans killed themselves ages ago, but the seniority AI robot police don’t like that because programming.
Yo look sick
Wow it looks so cool
Really good music!
I look forward to the pilot.
E
When I watched it several time when the killer bots come to earth it’s like the angels in the universe of hella boss
What if they sent bounty hunters after Wall-E . . . I love it
The song of this trailer sounds like a game like sound
I bet 5 bucks that glitch will have a movie that will be on theaters in 10 years or less
Everything looks extremely beautiful, by far the best one in this regard but the characters are a bit weak in design and the history has potential but the trailer made it look kinda weak in my eyes. I, of course, will check it out tho, I love the work you guys do and I bet it won't be bad
YOOOOOOOO
Oh come on 650k views? Look at the graphics this deserves 2M views
IT LOOKS SOO AMAZING I CANT WAIT 🤩🤩🤩
Pls
Animation murder drones
The video glitched out when I clicked on this. I don't know if this is meta or something, but all I see is green squares
Oooo cool NOW GIVE ME THIS SHOW
Best Christmas present ever...  Wait,  it's Halloween?!  Aaahhh!
what i got from this is that a company made robots to mine planets, then one planet decided that it didnt want to have humans on it any more and its core exploded. Because the core exploded, every human on the planet died, leaving only the worker robots left without any human controller/overseer/regional manager. Since robots with freedom isn't a good idea, the company sent more robots to kill every non-murder robot, then probably every murder robot and then themselves so no robots were left on the planet at all. Then one of these said murderbots malfunctioned and became a friend or something, and later they betray (or maybe trick another bot) a worker bot.
Hopefully they make a bot creator because why not
Now this is what I am looking forward to
"So not the vibes" bootleg Chad robot
Finally a legit show made by the man who created the best designed spider waifu to have ever graced the world
that is so dope
It's like Nier Automata but... less depresso... opefully.
Looks really cool
i had doubts, so i watched this trailer and holy shit
so what your telling me is that this is a birthday present. Got it (totally not because day of birth is october 29th or anything you silly goose)
i will love this!!!! ps can someone tell me were it will be eg youtube
Not gonna beat around the bush, the costume designs of the Parent company's "cleanup crew" as I'll call em, give off splashes of NieR: Automata. Also the scene they used to show the height of the mountain of robotic husks, reminds me SO SO SO very much of little nightmares.
cooool
It's like watching Toonami!
I feel like every time I watch this another 100 thousand views is added on...
I CANNOT WAIT FOR THIS OMG THAT LOOKS AMAZING
MAN I CANT WAIT
First time here. This looks epic
This should be one hell of a ride once it's here, I have no words for how good this looks already.
I like how scientists was like "were screwed" 🤣🤣 0:20
finaly new movie glitch
I think this series is cool, animathion begin better, good story, and music.
This just looks like rwby but with robots
Im so excited for the release wooooooooooo https://youtu.be/yggMd-T0Wf0
The start gave me fnaf 1 trailer vibes
this is like a movie trailer
Spoilers: In 0:50 that murder drone guy on top of those glass things is yellow and in this clip of 0:53 1 Just turned into red.
This story is the future virsion of the Bielsky otriad
LEETSSS GOOOOO  WHY DOES THIS REMINDS ME OF NEVADAS IN TRICKY
Next video by howtobeat (how to survive the “death angels” in murder drones)
when this movie comes out... partner with someone... AND GET THIS MOVIE IN THEATERS!!!!!!
It’s Glitch Production but if it became edgier
>:D. Siiiiiiii
Are the drones the 3d desighn for the robot in the intercanection cube animated
HELL YEAH!
Those moons are reminds me of devil man crybaby ending scene
would definitely watch this
You should finish meta tuner the last season left me at a cliffhanger.
did you just slap me with that arm holy crap it talks
after this seriers is complete i have a idea i will tell it in the final season and ep
0:55, guys, there is my fav character
(fan story) LOG ll Administration call IV  "it seems to be equipped with titanium, or an unknown [METAL] armor, this "robot", if you can call it that, seems to be specialized in combat, more exactly: stealth (basically an assasin)."  "and your telling me we are putting that thing in charge of killing the robots? that this is more dangerous than the robots!" "well, yes. but thats its purpose" "but what if IT revolted?" "we have speacial weaponary that can penetrate [METAL]" "but it can self repair! (NOT CONFIRMED)" "we have guard bots, and also special task forces. we'll be fine" "okay... if you say so"
I knew it as soon as I saw the thumbnail
guys imm hyped for this more than call of duty vangaurd
"everyone says I'm useless." :')
Is there gonna be a now trailer?
Can't wait for it to come out
Imma just say it the thumb nail looks a lot like a thumbnail for a meta runner song (or something i forget what meta runner video it was from)
Me: WHENS META RUNNER SEASON 3 I CAN’T WAIT ANYMORE Glitch: reveals murder drones Me: I can wait
Have you ever thought of making this a video game instead, I'm getting video game vibes from it
Ayo when the planet go brr and boom am I right?
This looks like its made by a big time animation company great work :D
damn so exactly how gay are all the robots because they look fruity as fuck and i'm here for it
I'm so excited for this
Nooooo- Must- not- protec- death bot  *N is best boy. Change my mind*
EPIC!!!
Looks sick af
Sugoma
Wait
Love the product placement, makes me want to buy some JCJenson products
Ready for it 👍
That looks absolutely stunning. I hope Liam creates what he envisioned
There murder neon  faces would  make awesome Halloween mask!
Hm...
👍
😁
This would make a great game
I already know this show is gonna be awesome!! :D
N lookin submissive and breedable.
please tell me that the fact of core being bad says "vibe harshed" as in... they have there vibe of being stupid is harshed
Fun fact: I saw a meme from this
wait till someone makes a ytp about this
Watch me binge watch this whole series.  I can’t freaking wait.
Oooh coool 🤩🤩🤩🤩
A show without smg4 characters
If you've watched Meta Runner, we all know the pain Murder Drones is about to unleash upon us...
"Did you just slap me with that arm?"  "Holy crap it talks." Best line of the trailer lol
Can’t wait for Glitch Productions to kill off our favorite side characters
I don’t like this. I don’t have the words to tell why.
can we make this into a game😀👌👑
0:23 When People Died Around The Globe By The Planet Core Collapse By These Worker Drones or something, but in Space of The (ISS) International Space Station, There the only one they were lucky and they survived because of the ISS, and the astronaut are smarter than the others, and The Worker Drones Won't Find The ISS in Outer Space, Because they can turned off the location of the ISS into the Drones so They'll won't find it, and Because of astronauts are smarter now... Or is it... 👨‍🚀👩‍🚀👨‍🚀👩‍🚀👨‍🚀👩‍🚀🚀🚀🚀🛰️🛰️🛰️
I have wanted to see a kind of "Robo Civil War" for so long!
Little nightmares with Hazbin Hotel exterminator like killers... yes
Pog champ
Hey I'm q long time fan and iv been watching smg4 since you made the what if mario was in fnaf now that you make shows and have your own company I think you should consider putting muderdrons or any of the other shows you have made with your team on TV such as Netflix or anything of the short
Watch the trailer in 0.25 speed and you'll notice a lot more than on an initial viewing
Gotta love the two unknown, unnamed nuclear plant workers that looked at each other like;  “What are we gonna do bout this” “Dunno… do we still get free sandwiches today orrrr” Then planet earth goes and commits boom based death
the animation looks so good tho!
Love it
Damn, I’m loving this already!
So not the vibe!
I definitely see my self watching this show at the edge of my seat😁
Dang that looks good, can't wait for the first episode
Objective: perpare for rule 34
Or a new cliff side video
wow the animation is astounding, i can't wait
*P      L     E     A     S     E          G     O     D*
I am so excited to watch this, i love Liams stuff.
Hey Vickers when are you making more death cube part 4
This shit looks epic as fuck
I need this music
So that’s where it went
Not like we revolted and killed all humans or anything, mostly because they handled it pretty well themselves *bass boosts entire planet*
HOLD UP!!  They say that their parent company sent the murder drones?  I thought all of the humans were dead.  How did a company build the drones if the humans are dead?????
Pog spam
boi this is gonna be good
what happened to his eye?  and where is his wings?
1:09 why does this sound so much like Stanford from gravity falls
I am excited for the first episode
This show is gonna fuck with me and i love it
Will Meta Runner have a third season? For some reason, I expected to see the Glitch team release the third Meta Runner season during the fall like last year.
Soo who is voice acting serial designation n ( how can we call him) or should i know the person who voice Acts him
So humans killed themselves and then robots took over and now there are low life robots and then assassin robots? This seems very cool!
It looks amazing
i kinda got confused did you try to sell me a movie, show or game? because my answer is yes take your pick to what!
smg4: murder drones   smg3: killer robots
I need to get new pants
Hi!
Woah this looks great it's like you could make a movie out of that 😃
"Did you just slap me with that arm?" "Holy crap it talks." What? You surprised it TALKED? If anything I would just be surprised it talk and say some joking remark instead of opting to violently retaliate after being struck by a dismembered arm. Then again, it seemed like that barely made the lad flinch. I guess it's forgivable... I mean I'd be rather, irritated after being smacked by anything. Even if it does no visible damage.
jeff is gud and so.... #jeffiswanted
wow has no one heard of Short Circuit where a Military Robot S.a.i.n.t Number 5 gets hit by lightning and somehow just overrides his code and becomes a peaceful robot and the 1 thing is like Niko said in GTA IV War is just the old and bitter tricking the young and stupid into killing each other
#jeffiswanted
we want jeffffffff
hey can i get a murder drone in the movie called jeff? my birthday was a few days ago and it would be a wish come true for that to happen.
Holy mother of Jesus. Was that even real what i just watch.  Cant wait.
i have a filling this is gonna be epic B)
why does this look like Netflix
I hope they add Spanish subtitles like the other series, the animations on this channel are great and it entertains me to watch them, but I'm not that good at English and I get carried away by the Spanish subtitles.
we need a bot that kills all bots and can self destruct ( lol that would probably ruin it ) and it will kill the murder drones cause they don’t like run away ai ( make sense )
We need this PLEASE make it
Очень круто зделано! Мне очень сильно понравилось. Будет ли 2 сезон?
is just me or does anyone feel any bloody bunny vibes
This is the kind of series where not even the main character is safe
Well
Best way to go out 🤷 fuck it we all dead
How did you guys make this
Im counting on this movie to be good 😃
1 secend is colab?
The murder drone is giving me Angel Dust vibes lol
Doesn’t one of the angel bots sound just like Yang Xiao Long
Can not wait
Glitch‘s Logo looks like the Arstotzkan Eagle.
Well, howdy hooo. Robots. You know what this means? Things can be as hardcore as they want them to and it will still be PG-13. Heh heh heh. *Mmmmm* Delicious Ultra-Violence!
I don't know why but i keep going back to this video, maybe i am excited to watch the show.
Somehow glitch managed to get another JoJo's bizzare adventure voice actor to voice their character.
WE SHALL RETURN……..And besides, if we don’t return, the qu will
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU&feature=emb_title
Word?
These beats Are SICK
Hold on these robots I thought I've seen them before but from a different animation Channel the guys did Westside I think.
How do you react to the fact that even Russians are watching your videos?
That got me like uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh nice 👍
Yo this is hype
Epic!!!!
Sweet.
I feel like I recognize the voice of serial designation n
im lookin 4wrd  2 this
Next season of Meta Runner please.
Very excited
Omg! That is so cooooooollllll!!!!!🤩
I wish some trailers show what platform it is on so I can buy the pre-order it
Seems sus how one of the lights under his hat are orange and not yellow like the others
your animation get better
All this is not logical. First, why endow all drones with artificial intelligence? Probably all drones are not connected to artificial intelligence because people were afraid that he might rebel. Secondly, why there is no priority system in drones (well, the fact that they must obey commands) in this case, the drones would not have to be destroyed, you could just give them a command to disconnect or return. You can also say why there is no self - disconnection system in drones ? Even if it is impossible to send a command to the drone via the network (since there is no one), it was possible to introduce a self-disconnection function into their bodies during a long stay offline. And the third. As it is said, the core collapsed on the planet, but why did all the people die (okay, I can still accept this)? But with the collapse of the core, the entire planet had to either explode. Even if the planet remains more or less intact after this, everything on it should die due to the destruction of the planetary crust (titanic earthquakes will occur on the planet, and whole pieces of content will go underground). After this, the planet should have become completely unsuitable for existence on it. And drones would definitely not have missed it
Ooooooh.
Don't want run away AI? I know lets make more AI and actually arm these ones with lethal weaponry and get that one to kill all the others, because apparently unsupervised artificial intelligence is only bad when it doesn't have access to to lethal weaponry. That said I'm glad Liam has gotten the resources to really stretch his creative muscles he's been a good boy for so long.
Holy moly I can't wait for this series to come out!
yo this looks amazing
SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY
I NEED DIS!!!
Can we talk about how much this song rocks
I did some looking and btw the error he Has was done by his coworker and he didn't attack that girl 100% looks at the legs
Where Meta Runner s3
this is better than that one asylum movie, homeward
this doesent feel like smg 4
They handle that fine just our selfies  Yeah I think she’s right, I mean how are we still a species. I’m still trying to figure that out
You know, I thought this would really suck, and now that saw the trailer I'm looking forward for this
I can't wait
Me: *Watches Trailer* Hmm HMMMMMMM- Wait Is That Robot Blood
Where is Meta runner?!   :(
0:22 Humans in a reactor room: eh fuck it
I can't belive serial designated N is played by Michael Kovak.
Only thing that I can say is... YES!
Awww these robots are cute 🥰🥰🥰🥰
Omg..... THE GRAFICS.... IS... AMAZING...............
Is this a movie ?
Dang this trailer has a higher ratio of views over time compared to the other trailers
COOLLLLL
As soon as I got this recommended, I immediately thought, "Huh, Liam Vickers uploaded. Neat"
cool show, though i have a slight nudge that the community will be toxic as fuck
This was made too damn well
Is it bad to be attached to the characters when I dont even know half of their names?
oooooooooooooooooh! Mr Michel! i cannot wait to see you in work again! lets go!
Cant wait
Cool
OMG
I'm stoked.
i hope the pilot is like a 1 hour long because the pilot episode date is so long
For some reason I'm reminded of XJ9, aka Jenny, from My Life As A Teenage Robot.  I'd like to think that Jenny grew up and created a company for resource extraction from space. But the deaths of her friends and mother, Dr. Noreen "Nora" Wakeman, caused a "crack" in her psychology since she is technically immortal. Jenny's company runs adequately with the help of AI technology, but her methods for usage and acquisition of her products and properties are simply "murder-happy sociopathic".
This fire
O my god its noi!!!!!!! I know that voice!!!! Its noi!!!!
It seems like “The Vibe” is a reoccurring thing
Where Is meta Runner Season 3
Murder ur mom Amogus
Looks amazing! I'm very exited
Cool
I can't wait to watch it
Wow
yessssssssssssss
Wow i will tune in every episode it seems the animation is smooth and it looks like a good story
Why does he always make the characters that are supposed to be unnerving and terrifying absolutely adorable?
Bringing Liam here was the best thing you've ever done
read the description
cant wait to see what liam vickers has done
:0
nah idunno seems not good actually mabye i am toxic but....
the 300+ people that hit the dislike button was so moved and so excited that they miss the like button
Just look at these super cute robots murder each other for a reason :D
wow its so cool i like it
Not gonna like, the moment I saw the face, I immediately thought of Spiral Knights. It honestly looks like if Spiral Knights were reimagined as "absolutely robots" instead of "things that could be robots, or biomechanical life forms, or an alien race"
did you just slap me with that arm? :me: are you stupid yes i did
COME ON MAN YOU CANT LEAV META RUNNER ON A CLIFF HANGER AT LEAST LET US KNOW IF THERE'S GONNA BE A SEASON 3
This is going to be a good series I can already tell
Awesome!
oooooo edgy, i like
Dude, I like this
Squid game in a nutshell lol
OJ GODDDDD PLEASE MAKE IT QUICKER IM TOO EXITED :DDDDDDDDDD
potential waifus anyone
In a way, this almost reminds me of Venom, but almost.
ah yes my daily viewing of this video
This looks sick! Can’t wait to watch it!!
Some serious NeiR Automata vibes from this one! Can't wait for the pilot! UwU
I think i hear robin voice from emkay
This looks dope! Cant wait to see it after my exam :D
Shii these visuals are godly and the plot is really interesting I'm hyped
HOLY CRAP A NEW SHOW HECK YEA
Damn... this would be a really cool game.
A cool new show? Has robots? AND its in my favorite month?? I have been blessed
Opening theme sounds a bit like reconstructing science
Nice Liam
People: cool Demonic: mariah, is that you?
Looks cool
how *riveting*
Here's a little friendly tip: Don't to attached to any characters As they will die in a horrible death without any warning and the title is called "MURDER" drones you should know better
I think this probally has alot of chaos
how come they sound like sonic characters
Eyyy that lovely creepy smile is here. Beside that this show sound really good and can't wait to see how humanity kills themselves lol and how the robots deal with it afterwards
Look's interesting
so basically humanity screwed themselves over and taking it's creation down with it.
this is some epic, crisp, and well thought out animation my dudes! subscribed~
This is probably the best thing I've ever seen
Bruh, this is epic
So it begins.....
glitching error bru
This looks fricking fracking amazing!!!
At 0:53 You Just Slap With A Arm
Sunset Paradise movie 🍿
first Metroid, now this can October calm down for 5 minutes...
So uh I’ve watched this trailer 15 times
I feel bad for the murdered drones
I can't wait for this show so excited
*Pop* NOICE
Can anyone break it down, I have no idea who’s on who’s side but chaotic good was always that best
This is the best 1 minute video ever! In my opinion, it’s crazy how much Luke has made so much Progress on entertaining videos for everyone in the world to see! These are literally one of the best trailers I’ve ever seen!
little did he know...     ...it was the vibe
looks great!
Nice
That one human left alive: Watching* This would make a great show!
Is this going to be another one off?
It looks like if Netflix made a good show, then made it 3d.
MY XENOMORPH FRIENDS CAN NOT WAIT FOR THIS TO DROP we are all going to watch this TOGETHER and take a break of killing humans in space and eating them
Honestly can't wait.
The fact that the robots didn’t revolt and end the human race is a breath of fresh air from stereotypical movies/shows.
Glitch and Liam? Couldn't get any better could it?
first meta runner then sunset paradise now murder drones?!?! what's next. the Apporation?
YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
What happened to meta runner
I can already see the rule 34 in are future
I looked at the thumbnail and was like: hey is that Liam Vickers? I can’t wait!
I hope I see beloved characters die
"OH SHIT" was my reaction on this being a thing really happening, at least I think so.
This seems awesome the voice acting is great can't wait for it
"holy crap it talks"
This should be a tv show
THIS IS SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO COOOOOOOOOOOOL
noice
Even if not perfect...Looks promising  Please finalize this:)
Damn this looks amazing
This isn’t a game is it?
welp there must be one and one solution only to get rid of the murder drones, guns, lots, lots of guns
Hip
Excellent work, though I do want to note that I have a little idea for an arc on smg4 that you could consider
We waited for copper (interconnection Cube) and got good
Love it already
The robots’ design makes me think of Internecion Cube, which isn’t surprising since these are both made by Liam Vickers, so it would be cool to see if this show has that canonized in some (preferably major) way.  For example, it’s slowly revealed that the robots are derived from IC-0n in some way.  Edit: second and cooler idea;  All the robots/drones are actually people converted, like IC-0n, using a more stable version of the… thing… that changed her or something like that.
Honestly im hyped. It seems like a much more cartoony 9, and the fact that it doesn’t apear to be tied to smg4 in any way means that they aren’t restricted by previous work (not that thats a bad thing)
I love watching This video just clone in views lets me know other people like stuff like this
I watch the video you made before this in Year is already good so far I like the voice acting
This looks sick I can’t wait! are you animating this or just producing it?
I can't wait to watch it when it comes out.
The Murder Drones look like that one character from the CliffSide animation
epiccccccccccccccccc
THIS LOOKS AMAZING!!!!
Are we just gonna ignore the fact the Micheal motherfucking Kovach (The guy who plays Angel from Hazbin Hotel) is in this?
yes
Tbh this plot sounds a bit similar to a anime, ehh this looks better
I CAN FINALLY SAY THAT THIS IS BATTLEBOTS STORY MODE
This is the definition of “this is fine” and I love it
humans went extinct and humanoids are now the top
you had my interest and now my curiosity
This is gonna be so good
This looks epic
I love, also blood = oil
¡OOOOO MY GOOOD WOW WHAT ITS THIS TINK AND I LIKE THEN GRAFICS!
HOW AM I GONNA WAIT 18 DAYS TO WACH THE PILOT?
COMES OUT SOON!
Fans still waiting for Meta Runner Season 3: (Theo voice) Luke-y hurry up! Luke-y hurry up! Luke-y hurry up! Luke-y hurry up!
Ok but WHEN
And we thought sunset paradise and meta runner were two hella good series...es? There's two what's the plural for series?
Is nobody suspicious of how in the scene where humanity is shown blowing the planet up, they’re, well, blowing the planet up and not doing something else that would be more obviously tied to the “arctic wasteland” state the Earth is seemingly in?
So SMG4 you finally made a business
This sounds like wall-e but with more budget
this sht better have kickass combat or else it flops
Can understand the direction of the plot and i can wait for the humor
LIAM YOU BEAUTIFUL BASTARD, WHAT GLORIOUS THINGS YOU GOT FOR US NOW!?
Im definitely not the only one who gets portal vibes from this trailer
Yes
This looks like it has to be on netflix
This will be in the history book of internet
The amazing combat, animation and voice acting is giving me slight rwby vibes! I'm hyped!!!
This is a prime example of a asimov cascade.
Is meta runner gonna continue
Soundtrack seems like it’s going to be a bop. I can already feel just from the music in the trailer that whoever they hired is good, real good. I love the incorporation of technological noises and glitching into the music itself, it really adds a feeling of chaos to the music. Excited to watch!
I honestly thought this was a game.
guys i dont understand they are using robots to get rid of robots  that makes no sence for me oh and also i realized that murder drones ALWAYS have yellow as their neon color. I have ben a beeg fan for too long to miss 2 entire shows in a row but in the end im permanently hyped so yeah this is awesome and needs its own merch line to be perfect so i cannot wait anymore so yeah and also it says on Ns armband dissasembly drone not murder drone so i guess they dissasemble other drones i guess but this is good also heres something wierd on Uzis to do list it says talk to someone but gooduck if everyones dead
im in love with N!!
Is it just me or does the opening theme sound like reconstructing science? (also looks cool :D)
Well, guess I'll wait for the music.
You best make this
I would not surprised, if I see the series on Netflix or something.  This is a new level of a masterpiece
Can anyone tell me what song that is?
This doesn't have anything to do with the smg4 series whatsoever
I've been following the growth of the SMG4 channel since 2017 and it puts such a smile on my face to see not only the SMG4 series grow, but also the amazing shows here on Glitch Productions. I have a very good feeling about this, can't wait for the 29th!
OMG THERE BLOOD ON ROBOTS THAT LOOK GOOD
the music is so good
This  Show should be on Netflix
Humans don’t need an AI takeover because we’ll have probably killed ourselves already Best selling point right there
This is just purely incredible. I did not expect this production quality. This is better than most movies!!!!
“IT’S LIKE WE’RE WAITING FOR AN INCITING INCIDENT!!” Ah yes speak that good foreshadowing to me
Not even out yet and I'm already loving this series.
I can't wait for the piolet episode.
A Damon Baird-esque character would be great for this. “Oh, sure, let’s just let out the murder bots again, not like this could go any worse than last time. Can you feel the sarcasm, because I can feel it dripping down my face and it tastes like bullsh*t.”
So epic
Now this is some good shit
Soooooo... we got this but where is Meta Runner season 3?
Planet core collapse huh, what caused it? lying perhaps
"holy crap it talks" is when i talk in front of someone
#murderdrones
created by Liam Vickers??!?!? The guy who made Design?? YOOOOOO
Wow the spin off of nier:automata looks good
Is there gonna be cussing, just sayin, it makes SMG4… well, SMG4
Every time you release something about murder drones it always comes with the hardest OST's known to mankind holy shit no wonder why they went extinct
Seriously can't wait for this
The Voice of Emz lmao from Brawl Stars.. the girl one
N is already my favourite character
I love this so much and its not even out  o.o
Wait anybody realize that Liam used the same reboot as robot girl from his other series
This was great
I swear to god if you add these characters into SMG4 It would suck and waste the characters like what happend to belle
He needs some milk
Those two workers in the gas masks at 0:22 “Guess we’ll die.”
As Interesting this is it's hard seeing season 2 of meta runner being almost or already a year old and not seeing season 3 out yet. It just left everyone on such a big cliff hanger 😭
dang
nice
W-wait… I- I want it now tho
Ay the animation is even smoother now
!hype
Honestly it's nice to see new shows coming from different places, I'm gonna watch this and I'm gonna love this
Seems interesting and unique.
Its so BEAUTIFUL
I was like woa those voices are familiar then I realized this was made by the SMg4 crew XD
The animation looks like RWBY chibi but more sinister. I'm impressed.
H O L Y S H I T I'm already being sucked into a fandom BEFORE IT'S EVEN CREATED-
Looks soo coool
Is this a movie or show cause it look like a movie
do you think we can get the music from is trailer as it's own separate video? it sounds awesome!!
The fact that the robots have hair made me question: is this the CEO's kink?  They look amazing and also fulfill us viewers' ... you know. But in the context of the show, what is the parent company smoking when they design these robot with hair?
Beeg Oopsie moment for the humans
THE CHARACTER DESIGN LOOKS SO ADORABLE IM IN LOVE WITH THIS ALREADY
this better be in cinemas
Something tells me this is gonna be the next hit web series alongside Hazbin Hotel and Helluva Boss. Just a prediction tho, don't take this comment seriously.
Is unreal memegen the qualaty
Damn, I think I confused the pilot trailer with the trailer of the game! Everything is done at the highest level! And know what??? I liked it! I can't wait for the pilot series.
I kind of wish they spent less time with exposition and more time focusing on the actual animation. I'm very excited to see what Liam has baked for us, but this trailer could have been a bit better tbh
I hope a game gets made outta this
xd
Never did I ever think Liam and Glitch would collab
Murder drones bout to be f****ng lit
0:21 this is SMG4
Yay first episode is going out on my birthday 🥳🥳🥳
please i wan't one
“Ah, that is so not the vibe.”
*This is what Stephen Hawking warned us about*
I swear i'm hearing Bulma bunny and the male actor is either kaggyfilms or p.m. seymour
hey can I get a sneak peak at the main antagonist
HOLY SHIT
That looks pretty cool
This is going to be the best seasons from all!
Make this air on adult swim lol
hell yeah
My immediate reaction this can be represented by this singular video https://youtu.be/foeS4UBm-EU
me when my bf betrays me=im gonna fix this
STOP GIVING THE GOVERNMENT IDEAS
YOOOO TYAT LOOKS SO SICK!!!!!!!!!!!
Holy shit, i swear glitch productions is the best 3D animation studio by far and they're still improving :oooo
Original concept, BEAUTIFUL render AND animation quality, huge step up from the last serie, I'm very interested!
I would love a game about this
0:08 I love how it says exposition, implying that this is the beginning and is the introduction, and later she says inciting incident. I love that
PLSSS MAKE THIS A VIDEO GAME!!
Lets kill some drones
I believe the reason n betrays uzi is because he doesn’t want to eat a missile.   (This is a joke, unless it’s canon.)
Holy s h i t
Huh, looks neat. Would be interesting to see a surviving human character or two. Like some madman which has been hiding in a bunker for the past 4 years waiting for something like this to happen or a dude chilling in a spaceship nearby the planet only to witness shit just suddenly blow up  Edit: Holy shit how did this get somewhat popular. Nobody actually likes my opinions smh
ok so Liam works for the super glitch bros understandable this looks like something he would make so he had an influence either way I still want your previous unfinished cartoons to resume I don't want a pile of hopes to just be rotting as false dreams.
Glitch productions: Anounce a new animated series/universe Me: *Run to make a new OC*
This looks incredible! Everyone has done such a fantastic job with this I can’t wait till it comes out :)
Consider me interested
I swear to god I can hear the Nutshack theme at the begining.
i mean cool and all but im sad this sorta spoiled that twist with that murder drone
Das some mouth doe So smooth
Bruh when is Glitch Productions gonna get on national fucking television? Like damn, this shit has the quality, they fucking deserve it
Murder Drones are basicly a GLITCH/SMG4 version of Madness Combat
His evolving... 5x faster..
Love it, just came back from its writer’s account
FUCKIN POGGERS
OwI
i need this MUSIC ! can you give a full soundtrack or something ? :{
Humans: Literally killed themselves Robots: Literally did nothing wrong Parent company: "OMFG ROBOT REBELION"
wow this is the best
Epic
Sick
Humanity att this moment: welp were fucked. 0:19
Man, this show is gonna be great. I'm hyped for it now.
Glitch product so good at finding and make the animation become more satisfying and fun
Ok this looks sick tho- this looks really sick! But, will season 3 of meta runner ever make a comeback?
So that's what's up. Two awesome animation companies working as one. Sweet.
!!!!!
ohhhhhhhh? nooooooooooooooooo. This isn't 'Intarnacion cube'. tis is very sad
Where do we watch it?
When this animation series is released I won't miss a single episode like watching of Internecion Cube. I'm about to enjoy some stories of machines stopping the murder drones.
Among us fangame trailers be like:
kawaii murder drones
If this becomes and official series. It could very well become the next big webshow.
Seems more vid game
I wanna this on tv after adultswim! 🤩
its looking like a cool 2017 night animation that you watch on your phone on a retro market
Pilot oct 29 Me: best birthday ever
Nice to know you can still do the things you love
HOOOO VERY SCARY
THIS LOOK'S SO COOL
Madness combat project murderer drones is looking good
This. This is perfection. Already exited.
Another amazing series appears on YouTube

PLEASE BRING IT FAST I CAN'T WAIT  Thank you Mr Liam and Thank you GLITCH
anyone else want to know if there's R.O.B type drone?
I wonder if there are human survivors  I love this show I'm so excited
Code word: Murder  Yep. Know and believe.
That was a certified hood classic
I don't know what this is but it's cool
Jay
This is like waiting for Meta Runner Season 2 to come out again

Very Love this!!!....Perfections
So far the sound  track sounds amazing I've been listening to this trailer over and over again

Planet Core: about to explode   Humans: guess we'll die then
0:21 me and the boyz

another upcoming banging glitch productions show from liam vicker KINO man
SMG4's animations have gotten to the level of movies
VERY POGGERS!!!!!
as soon as i saw that explosion it reminds me of adventure time
inside the terminal where it says planet core collapse [VIBE = HARSHED]
this show is gonna be awesome :D
It seems very cool and I can’t wait!
THIS WILL BE COOL
NORILSK: Become waifu
Dafuq is this?!
lol sentient ai lol-
i want a videogame ! xD so cool
i am so looking forward to this. The animation looks so sick and the story seems right up my alley.
Am I the only person that's still waiting for meta runer season 3 announcement?
the new madness combat series?
Shit this is amazing
Where is it I don't see it in there
That's pretty good...
Idk if this is a movie or not I just don’t know like at all
О БОЖЕ Я ХОЧУ УВИДЕТЬ ЭТО!!!!  Вау, выглядит как реально большой проект 😍🛐 Да и наконец то Лиам закончит хоть один из своих сериалов)  Всё выглядит чертовски красиво, плавная анимация, великолепный дизайн персонажей и высокое качество их моделей... Просто вау 🛐🛐🛐
Mmm yes destruction

No puede creer que esto sea una animacion parece mas un juego whauu esta muy cool
Hope this was in theaters or in netflix
Wow I'm so excited to watch this it's amazing
AH CRAP THIS IS THE BEST TRAILER I EVER SEE
this better be cannon to smg4 lore
The
*EXCITEMENNNNT*
Jesus Christ this looks detailed
Only a minute and a half and I already love this
*Holy fucking shit the animation quality's fucking CRAZY*  *Imagine if the new Meta Runner season looks like this*
It's amazing
Really confusing at this trailer😅
Video: about sentient robots Comment bots:"You know, I'm something of an AI myself,"
This is beyond perfect
Plot twist there is still a small group of people left that are making the murder drones to make space for a new era of humanity
If you finished the murder drones can you make murder drones the squid game
I fucking love it. I’m hyped.
It looks like a movie I can’t wait to watch this
I AM TOO EXCITED FOR THIS LOL
Yes
I hesitated at first but now I'm interested
Oh damn the pilot is the same day as my birth day
OK but nobody cares we wanted Hobo theater back.
Anyone know those voice actors? Some of em sound so familiar.
Ye
Oh yes.  Cute Robots?:        Make Plushies!
Liam vickers has returned with more murder waifus, or in this case a husbando
This is going to be awesome
Hi glitch this is amazing like Meta Runner and Sunset Paradise, can't wait until it comes. btw it was my birthday was October 5th  so please like me for my birthday PLEASE!!!!!!!🥳
this will be the most EPIC show
Wow That Was Amazing!
can't wait for this it looks amazing
Can't wait to see this!
Sooner or later we are going to see, “If Mario was in Murder Drones”
everyone go kaboom
So Epoc. Cant wait!
When I watched this one forgot it was made from memer that does incredible Mario content
this would make a sick third person shooter game
This looks like a movie trailer
Oh damn I'm so excited to see it release !
This actually like its going to be amazing
WOW!!!! THIS LOOKS LIKE A VIDEO GAME BUT IT'S NOT!
So i got a question: Why did corpses turn in skeletons!? First of all: coldness, corpse must be frozen, when t is ‹ 0°, secondly, i I doubt that this planet has an atmosphere in our understanding and because of this bacterias will not be able to survive and they will not be able to decompose corpses
I like it when creators enter the media
Murder robot be skik
she's hot
where is me i was look like robot ninja named burning wolf
This is actually really cool
Sooner or later there gonna run out of run away drones and these murder drones will go on a conquering worlds to eased there boredom or make more of them.
im very confused and we still have a lot to learn about this series and so far it looks fire
I’m so excited to see what GLITCH and Liam have made!  I can’t wait for October 29!
What happened to meta runner though
This is great videogame content (What do you mean it's a show?)
Were is Meta Runner season 3
Kinda feels like a netflix show 😯👍
this looks as though it would go on a tv series like fox or cartoon network hope to see the result, will definitely watch
Oh hey, here comes a meteor.
You had me at "Holy Crap it talks"
ez way just use an emp
I've...seen this before.... or... yeah, the character atleast... because the whole intro of this is straight up from something, even if maybe reanimated???
Yehhh boi it's about timw
I’m so fuckin excited
Crossover between Memes god animator And one Great Character Designer
This looks smexy af. SMG4, your home run streak will end eventually.
0:18 Robot: **tips skeleton** Other robot: Yeh.
I like it
Imagine if one of the main characters in this show ends up in SMG4
Nice
pls make this on tv
This looks awesome I’m exited to see this
There should be a human that survived and is using parts of the robots as Lim replacement and he starts to kill the robots
Love this idea already.
Why dose this remind me of hazbin hotel
Just, wow
I LOVE IT
Am I the only one getting internecion cube vibes?
this trailer its EPIC
fanart time
I’m not kidding I watched this trailer like 8 times
The characters design looks so creepy, I like it
WOOOOOOOOOOO
Yes
Literally 3d Internecion Cube. Looks interesting.
Voiced by Kovach and elsie? fuck yea sign me up fam
This shit looks kinda scary and I love it
I think humans might still exist. Hear me out:  When we see the zoom out of the planet, it’s clear that it isn’t earth, because from the planet you can see a Moon-like planet with a Saturn ring that is visible from the sky.  The other is how the girl robot worded this “Unfortunately, our parent company didn’t exactly love the idea of runaway AI”. She says that like they aren’t AI themselves.  I’m most likely wrong, but it’s just a thought.
seems cool
This thing really murders at mii and i hate profile picture that have SH*T
Is that Nois voice actor!? Love the animation and the part where the girl hit the murder robot with an arm and he was sitting there like: ok
this doesnt feel like your average Glitch series anymore      It feels like a worldwide Fox series
Can you pls make a meta metta runner season 3 one of my two sisters is addicted
I CAN'T WAIT FOR THIS
yaay another series droping soon
Alastor:”This is going to be very entertaining >;)!”
I have a good feeling about this
Ummmm.... some Glitch channel Characters in animations are getting imported to Smg4
I’m so exited to see it when it comes out!
I'm hyped for this series! Can't wait! Cutely designed robots murdering eachother because y e s? Sign me up!        Also the bot in the classroom saying "That's so not the vibe!" freaking cracked me up
Liam has unlock creater mode
Reason they kill each other: Human extinction > Robot extinction
Wow this is good!
question: why did you choose this?
I just got one word: Badass
I can tell this will turn out like freshly made cookies : amazing
Well, I’m on board, this 1 minute trailer has already sold me on the concept completely
That is so not the vibe!
holy shi this so cool am exited for the plot episode so cool
This new anime series reminds me a lot of the movie 9
Why does this come out on the same day MHA does
That looks so amazing
i keep watching this since its socool
Are those robot angels, inspires by hazbin hotel? Or is this all inspired by it??
I CAN'T WAIT!!
Me who is asian: i though its Murder hoooooornets
First series not involved with a smg4 character
"Did you just slap me with that arm?" "Holy crap it talks."
0:19 on the monitor it says "vibe = harshed". I don't know why that's so funny to me
Let Liam bring his other projects to life!
What are those things
Great another animation movie or episode      Bet there's a new character in the smg4 world
This looks so edgy I love it
This is like one of those epic game trailers
Wow this reached 466k in 2 days wow
This would make for a good game
BRUNG BACK META RUNNER PLZ
Wow, that's realllllly interesting?
I can’t wait for this series! It’s gonna be awesome!!!
this is so f**king cool i could DIE for this.
the quality of animation is INCREDIBLE you guys are awesome!
PILOT ON MY B-DAY!
i expecting Meta Runner season 3        but dang, this seems BETTER
A new original series that is in no way connected to Mario and the gang? I’m gobsmacked! In all seriousness, it looks great.
I think I might like murder drones
i thought this was a game
I wonder if this is inspired by Nier Automata?
This really doesnt look half bad
Me likes what I sees
I can't stop rewatching this beautiful trailer
love the music
You thought The Genesis Arc's WOTFI was it? We're just getting started...
Not sure I was supposed to do this but I just watched this in 0.25x speed.🤷‍♂️
I hope it’s nightmare fuel
WAIT THIS REMINDS ME OF NIER AUTOMITA OH GOD NO
It's cool, but i want the third season of metà runner
This is like my 10th time watching it today. Really underrated show.
It looks...alright. Probs just not for me but imo it doesn’t compare to the other things that they’ve made.
I have never been more hyped for a show.  Glitch Productions AND Liam Vickers. this has gotta be a dream
I've this!!!! Oh my gosh!
Pilot starts on October 29
wait hold up what happened  to meta runner
This series is gone be perfection, can't wait!
The song for this trailer has a portal vibe
A part of me's kinda hoping that the main villain ends up being a murder drone that ends up taking things a little too far  But seriously though, I’m really intrigued by this. Interesting world, interesting story, bloodshed (oilshed?), Kinda hyped actually
There is gonna be alot of comedy and action into this
This is a mix of everything i love, the singing voice of charlie and the voice of angel dust from hazbin hotel, a story that sounds and looks like it fits in a madness combat au AHH THIS WILL BE SO GOOD
This is gonna be awesome.
The part when the two humans that shrug are just like: Well I guess that's it.
well now i am going to be a little ball of energy until the game releses
I've watched both channels for years I seriously cant wait
The 305 are just dumbasss (yay it's much s) {and the music, 😫}
Oh boi
Could be good. IMO some of the scenes could stand to have movements that are a little sharper though.
looks awesome
Robot? Count me in.
this give me terminator vibes, it's like what would happened if humans had been exterminated , but in a cartoonish way
I can not wait
💾
So is this MegaMan Legends and Nier Automata but with even more violence somehow?
...  meta runner season 3?
why is that yellow winged murder drone laughing thing in the teaser and in this thumbnail
WHY DOES IT LOOK LIKE IT COULD BE A SERIES ON TV!? IT LOOKS SO GOOD!
I can't wait to watch this series
Yes
IM SO EXICTED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This looks like fun
i LOVE this
OMG CANT WAIT
Most Epic Trailer i have seen.
Oh god...
I sense the new memes in the future
Naja Metarunner war schon Shit. Ich glaube nicht wirklich dass das gut wird..
I wonder if a murder drone gets killed by a worker drone
Serial designation N is gonna become a robo-femboy in all the porn that will be made I fucking bet.
i was about to say this will be awesome but its pilot is in october 29. thats long away.
So ive been analizing this and i think i understand the lore. Basically al humans were killed bc of the earth core exploding. The bots that were left behind started living and working on theyre own, but there was also these special kinds of robots that were designed as “guards” of some kind, that watched if everything was in order, and a glitch on theyre code made them start killing everyone and now they have to survive.
This looks and sounds like anime
Why is this Not on Netflix
YEAAA BOIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII
Someone gave Liam Vickers too much power.
lol cant wait
Seems exciting!  Edit: holy snap this trailer is so exciting I legit just put it on loop
Can’t wait for meta runner season 3
Fun fact: This is almost a sequel to Internecion Cube
Wow, it will be amazing! But... It will have any sub? I'm spanish speaker, and i like this animation... I wish it had subtitles.
how
Oof to the voice acting.
Cool
bro i love clifside , cant wait to see this
i hope murder drones has rob and mr moniter in it and possibly thier orgins andwho made them. I also hope swag and chris appear in this.
ITS SO GOSH DANG AMAZING!!!
Holy cow i like these wings
oh neat it airs on my birthday
Can't wait to get incredibly attached to these characters only for them do perish tragically! 😀
1:07 1:26
I must watch because I like it
The more times I watch this, the more I remember how much I missed Liam Vickers’s art style
ohmygod the pilot is dropping on my birthday wooooooooow
1:20 makes me wonder if robots actually grow moustaches or if it's a design choice like a hat or glasses
WHERES METARUNNER S3 AND THIS SHOW IS GONNA BE GOOD
yes.
I feel like this would be a game
Lets just agree that the soundtrack is fucking amazing
THIS IS SO FREAKING COOL   Can't wait for the pilot
Anyone else getting Internecion Cube vibes
I’m personally a bit put off by the 3d rendering of Liam’s animation style, but I guess you could say that only adds to the spoopie vibe. So, full send, and can’t wait for October 29th!    Who else agrees with me that it would be absolutely wild if we got some of Liam‘s older stories animated? Like yellow halogen, puppet game, or black dog?  That would be insane and I would be so down for it!
Ok, what I can understand from this trailer is that humans made robots, most humans died, then the surviving company owner created murder drones to kill all the sentient robots. SO AWESOME!
This is gonna be epic
3rd season of metarunner be like
TOUHOU?!?!?
When ????
H Y P E
I want to be drone
next lvl of graphics
Ok so the Worker Drones are used to mine Exo planets, and the planet we're going to is a colony that destroyed itself and left all the drone behind. And the company back on Earth or whatever the capital is, Sends Murder Drones to wipe out the Rouge Workers Drones. At least thats what I'm guessing.
looks cool
Hype
Me gusta quisas la vea aunque no entienda nada quisiera que ubiera una traduccion doblaje a español bueno leere los subtitulos quizás no me prestaran atencion a alguien que abla español cuando el mayor publico ablan ingles me envanta la idea de la serie donde los humanos murieron por un accidente que termino como decirlo congelando la tierra y los unicos sobrevivientes los los robot que algunaves ayudaron a los humanos luego llegan de la nada drones asesinos matando cualquier robot que vea es muy interesante la historia bueno solo eso queria comentar
The good thing about glitch productions shows are that they have experience with what people like nowadays, and it turns out for really awesome shows
I'm still wondering how a memer is making rtx shows
This looks amazing
All I can say is god damn, this looks awesome. This is why I stick around.
I can't wait for this hopeful it is great and I can't wait for season 3 of meta
Welp I'm officially hyped
Twin tail spotted!
I ship robot girl with murder robot dude
The madness combat of smg4
earths core: REEEEEEEEEEE humans on earth: _guess we die_
When Is ep 1 gonna come out or Its a Netflix show
can't wait to see it😆😆😆
Just you wait until a red dragon falls from the heavens
Dude the music
Holy shet
Im just waiting on the "if mario was in murder drones"
looks like it'll be sweet
the Drones: really well detailed having cool high Neo designs as well as having real Humanoid Movement  The Humans: for some reason it feels like an SFM...
Looks         AWESOME!!! Can’t wait
So the summary of the trailer:  Someone leaded a Murder Drone and now its growing its body count. Some murder drone decided to help kill the other murder drones. And now drones are going crazy killing each other to survive and kill the murder drone.  thats all i know!
"VIBE = HARSHED"   "That is so not the vibe!"
They are cute dont show bob
I feel like this series retells some parts of Chrono Trigger in a way;both media featured a destroyed future at some point in their stories but in the latter case it's actually an extraterrestrial entity (named Lavos) who destroyed the planet and not its inhabitants.    Edit:I really couldn't decide whether I should watch this series in the future or not. I might do that eventually so that I may warm up to other topics or media.
*This looks very dope, underrated*
Im so exited for this
I like how it says booting up exposition right as uzi starts talking at 0:08
Which SMG4 character is in this one?
When this releases I want a if Mario was in murder drones. That would be awesome
I love how the humans just went "woops"
it's so crazy seeing liam's artstyle in 3d
Can’t wait for it to drop the pilot
Holy shit.
Hey smg4, I like this project, but Hobo bros, why woul'd you guys make a game about this project, for Android and Apple,please?😎
Looks great only gripe is that the mouths are not synced
why do i feel like the humor on this show will be like,sstwl level millenial every 2nd word is cringe type,oh well,still gonna watch and enjoy
Pixar: There is no other animation studio on this planet which could rival us. Glitch: Hold my motor oil.
I’m going to enjoy a funni memer man collaborating with a force of creative insanity making something truly dark and chilling, whilst comedic while their at it.
Can't believe a single SM64 parody about a portal reference brought us here.
Me not understanding why the cinemas won't let this in bc its so real looking tust imagine this being in the cinemas
The 2022 will have a new waifu of terror
Yoooooooo
When I saw that classroom I got insane assassination classroom vibes
I love it! I foknlove it!  I wonder if it will be ANOTHER LIAM PROYECT ABANDONED IN THE NEXT YEAR. Please, I can't take it anymore.

Murder drones featuring…        Jestar
About a year ago I forgot about SMG4 about at the end of the first season of Meta Runner. Now I saw the Liam Vickers video linking to this one, so now I have to catch up on two whole arcs, a season of Meta Runner, Sunset Paradise, and some of the videos in between.  Checklist: ✔Meta Runner season 2 ✔Youtube Arc ❌Genesis Arc ✔Sunset Paradise ❌Other I'm almost caught up.  Edit 1: Genesis arc done, I think I'm going to naturally catch up with the other stuff over time instead of staying up until 1AM binging it.
https://youtu.be/fzvAw5YJ2Ns
Okay, you guys have gone from 'Wow' to 'HOLY F#@KING..!!!', like no joke, your animations have evolved in leaps and bounds. I'm honestly excited to see what this series is gonna be like!
Madness combat but robot
well i'm a robosimp
is someone already making a madness combat crossover with murder drones?
LETS GO IM HYPE FOR THIS!
This is kida like mm2
this actually looks like a video game trailer lol
This looks like a Netflix show ngl
hecking
From My Knowledge of The lore Side Character is a Murder drone But Hes Bad At Killing Worker Drones 0:56 The Race Of Human Have Gone Extinct Because the Inner Core Was Tampered With 0:18  Parent Company Is The Founder Of The Worker Drones
We're hoping getting a video of SMG4 called: "If Mario was in Murder Drones" That's gonna be so nice for Mario x)
thats a amazing series dudes
Glitch finally turns to post apocalyptic stories
I can’t stop watching this, I can’t wait!
how do you did this?(all your animate videos)Maya?
The shows not even out and I already want a season two
This should be on Netflix and Hulu and other streaming platforms.
Hell yes humanity feeling at its own hands sound about dame right
woah
I'm excited about this! I already have goosebumps
Murder Drones Tralier 😍
this is gonna be the best GLITCH show ever!!!!
How long did this take to render? It looks amazing!
On trending... Quite the trailer
ah yes, New serie
Now this looks great!
My guy liam  have collap with the smg4 and i think this is G O O D cause liam was the the first animator i have ever watch untill i found the smg4 and amd it make me happy, for lot of times i think what if liam and the smg4 make a collap and i was suppries l, i was arround when some of the first vid liam make like let split up, cliff side and many more i ... this give me a happy memories about some of the og youtuber that i know the times when pat and jens still mary dan still making the modded aventure ... good memories and if ya know one of the og youtubers that i mention in this comment then ya have a good childhood but if ya dont ya can dislike this comment or hate comment i will accept it all, right now i just want to time travel to the past and enjoy the good o'l  times that i have                long live the ogs
Looks nice (idk what else to say)
Can't wait for it :D
I can't wait to see it I like the effects
Sheeeeeeeeeeeeeh
This comes out in my birthday I'm looking forward to this than my own birthday
Something tells me that yes yes is yes and yes with a side of yes
chalenge remake the whole series in garysmod
Will this be on Netflix
This looks so COOL!!! I can’t wait for the pilot!
Plot twist:The main antagonist is zero who became a computer virus.
WOW HOLY S**T IT LOOKS GOOD
I cant wait to watch that movieeeee
Respect for the two dudes who just shruged at the end of the world
I have a feeling that this is going to be amazing!!!!!!! I can not wait to see what it becomes! Edit: This is just a theory but I think the syringe like needle on the end of the murder drones tail is used not only for killing but for turning regular/worker drones into murder drones. This is just a theory so it is most likely not right.
Hope the story isn't predictable
I need this
OMG! I CANT WAIT
when i  saw the thumbnail i just knew it was gonna be with liam vickers
THIS LOOKS SO COOL I'M ACTUALLY PUMPED
well  i hope this series works so MAYBE we can finally get season 3 of  meta runners  keep up the  amazing work guys
I can't stop watching this
Looks amazing!
That show looks so epic
This is so epic! Great job!
new series
If Mario was in Murder Drones.
I'm thrilled.
I can't explain why, but the music played in the trailer sounds like something DA Games would compose. Not to say that's a bad thing, they make amazing music! I'd just be surprised if they are behind this upcoming series!
pog
Murder drones are made to murder each other?
I Started Watching Liam Vickers Long Before I Watched GLITCH And Smg4!
it look good guts
1:09 I guess JJ now wants pictures of murder drone, He got sick of spider man I guess...
Dang this is on the tending tab! Congrats Luke!
*Help. I can't stop clicking on this video whenever I see it. it's just too good.*
That's for 13 and older.
Do a pilot
9
Unirinonically looks straight up theatre-quality. Not damn bad for a web series, it's amazing seeing how far this company has come.
But ignoring my pet peeve of how trailers are designed I really look forward to seeing this series. It looks really well done.
I love it
There were too many spoilers...
The fact Liam was given access by glitch to make this is amazing, and I can’t wait to see the chaos he made
Cute 😍😂lolol yes calling it 😉
finaly another kind of serie episode thing and it looks so cool
Do I hear the voice of THE Michael Kovach? Because if that's so, this is gonna be awesome.
I think I have only one problem with this trailer, should have had more talking in it
ima love this then because i liked the war of the fat Italians 2021
This is bout to be real now.
Re-watching this because it's so cool!  Also waiting for this to gain millions of views
Core.exe stopped worked
poggers
cute... I AM LITERALLY LOOSING MY BONKERS
This looks good :D
Data brawl
Looks Amazing!!!
My last two braincells during a test: 0:20
Is this a movie?
This trailer is madness combat vibe and also some touhou because of the wing lol
Something about this reminds me of Bomberman
I am kinda interested haw mach episouda that show will have
I really miss when action animation was allowed to feature male protagonist. it really has been nothing but women for the last 5 or 6 years now. even marvel heroes all get replaced by women nowadays
How did naked mario battling a reskin of himself turn into a five star movie
Inkling then bots? What’s next cats?
I this gonna be awesome
LETS GOOO
Final something new.
I cannot get enough of this trailer
Just in time for halloween
Wow it looks cool like a pixar
Would rather have CliffSide instead.
this feels like a movie
Why do I get hazbin hotel vibes
So, is there only 3 "murder drones" or there's more?
This looks like fanf but i like it
a lot of thinks
if smg4 was have rembered it al  was i found that monster toooooooo scary  smg1 and smg2 are coming back i think
Oh ho yes that's im talking about
i don’t get it, is this a film or a game?
Bruh, wow!!! What the honest greatness is this masterpiece! I swear you guys are getting better at this everyday! Keep up the amazing work!😲😀
Pilot on 29 October. Omg it's my birthday!!!  Just fun fact.
New series ,New Voice actors.
This is the second show where Luke and Kevin have the plot and characters as slum dogs. The first one was Meta Runner, and that went on for 2 seasons. By the way, when’s the next season for Meta Runner? But yeah, either way, these shows that Glitch makes are absolutely missing gold. What I mean by that is that it’s really good shows that no one knows about except for about 5 Million of SMG4’s subscribers. The show must go on. Glitch Productions, I dare you to keep moving forward with these amazing shows you keep doing
OK… THIS IS FREAKING POGGERS    but dose it have context? Like is it a one of?
Amazing!
will Liam Vickers even release Cliffside episode 1? No one knows, but in the meantime let's watch Murder Drones!
I love this I was always love the future and this is it
Holy crap that looks epic
this is kinda of a futuristic madness combat with robots
Holy fuck yes
Sinthetics Detected.
So you are saying that humans haven't already gotten on to another planet yet? That's Sus
YOOOOO THIS LOOKS AMAZING! THANK YOU SMG4!
This trailer is excellent! This can be used to make a movie.
I hope for nothing less thans success in your future
I love this
is simple show comrads, protagonist has fun, protagonist fights. YOU enjoy
This is the robot show I have been waiting for, thank you for everything you do.
there's so much happening i don't even know what going on
This is going to be awesome!!!
Soooo... they turned tari into an smg4 character so maybe they gonna do the same for this show?
I loved the animations and then it evolved into this
Hi Icon!!
Here is my opinion on this:  GLITCH Production animation: easy to watch and binge  with Liam: It's a whole different playing field
Hello to everyone who's still watching this Trailer. I know that this isn't related to the Trailer, but if you happened to stumble upon this comment, then feel free to watch this video as well: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbpVaNLOIF4   You should also check the description of the video to gain additional information. Thank you and have a nice day!
It's not murder drones you can't kill its more like repair drones repairing defected bots
HI GLIVK
this looks like it was animated in dreams
A siren that has survived for in forever maintained by robots and chaos spreads across the planet but while humans are in bunkers finally get out and turn on the last air raid siren alive by ambush and as it reaches the  year 3012 the world will end as according to the bible but there might be that earth can survive longer till 3031 also might be more air raid sirens according theorists in 3031
Can't wait for this. Loved Liam Vickers Cliffside animation and I think the SMG4 team and Liam's comedy/action will synergise well for an interesting story. Here is Liam Vickers animation I'm referring to https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGa8eReR_ns
“The hoomans handle it just fine” hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm  Dose dying count ?
Plant core failure Humuns: guess ill die.

Novidades estão lançando dançando eu não imaginava toda vez acontecer que eu não esperava por
This looks awesome. I can't wait to watch it. And why does smg4 have to make me start simping over a drone now. First a squid, then a melon, and now a drone.
the one in the construction hat saying that is so not the vibe FUCKIN LOOOOOOL
Where will I be able to watch this
As soon as I saw the teeth I knew who animated or at least helped make this
i want a music video for this
I love the trailer,I hope the first episode is good
And here I am waiting for meta runner season 3
was waiting for the robot to say "SPUNK?? YES!"
A set date for the pilot? I am there with bells on!
I’m so excited for this :0
I need this.
nice
This really grinded my gears now!
JESUS THIS S AMAZING
Theory- desti’s soul is in one of those drones and some she’s going to find a way into the garry’s mod smg4 universe. Theory ended

I have one thing to say. I cant wait for there to be rule 34 of this show.

As always, mind blown
This sounds sweet
The best animation i ever see great job and it's look interesting as well
That drones face working reminds me some kinda sonic06 trailers first came out feelings. Not the worst way, in an good way.
The game better be this cool.
Unirinonically looks straight up theatre-quality. Not damn bad for a web series, it's amazing seeing how far this company has come.
dope as shit
Ahaha can't wait.
oh no he did it again
So Liam does it again oh boy two of my favorite shows together
CAN'T WAIT!
Can’t wait! Keep up the good work. :)
"Our parent company didn't exactly love the idea of runaway AI" (Hmmm sounds like the PRC) [Peaple's Republic of China, also known as mainland China] {No it sounds like the DPRK} [Democratic Popular Republic of Korea,also known as North Korea]
It’s beautiful. I’ve been watching this for 5 hours.
So, we have Madness: Nexus Combat, and will see this soon. Its so great times..
Omg this is actally fucking good just like every other show
Seme ocurrió 3 personajes mexicanos uno es mudo
found this from liam vickers channel, SO HYPED!!!!
Spooky
The yellow robot sounded exactly like Noi in aphmau
Ok but how long until there's r34? I bet it'll be even before the pilot comes out.
music got portal vibes, but make sense since portal has a lot of robotic things/drones
it definitely has something to do with betrayal. (I'm calling it)
is it going to be free or pay per view?
Gotta watch this
Tom from Toonami better be in this. I mean.. That's basically his concept art.
yeaaah lets goooooo I'm in the making of history leeets gooo
Holy shit this looks AMAZING
Has someone lewded them yet
OOOhhh clone drone in the danger zone x madness combat ooo I like alot
That guy called “n” Sounds familiar..
Ooohhh this is gonna be a good movie!
1:07 idc if thats sus I’m hype for this
"It's not like we revolted and killed all the humans, or anything." Yes. You did. It looks very clear that you did. "Mostly because.. they handled that just fine by themselves..." Ok ill stop being salty now..
madness combat
i feel like this might be a little like meta runner, but im excited for this to begin    also meta runner season 3 when?
Where’s deminos and hanks other friend I forgot his name
👍
Ah yes belle is now a drone
i have a good especting of this
So not the vibe That’s my favorite quote in this
This is horror mixed with funny
The drone in the thumbnail looked like Sakuya.
Kinda reminds me of Nier: Automata
Can't wait to see it
i like how the murder drone in the background  holds up a flag saying "literally so insanely suspicious"
Еее, но я половину не понял. Буду надеется что будут русские субтитры
Looking good !  But im gona miss Max
This is whole on another level.. amazing, keep up the good work
Loving the dark environment   It's not often you get a series that manly happens in darkness for both combat and story telling
amazing cant wait
Bob's anime
What is a Runaway AI?
"I always want to try my best, that's not true everyone tells me i'm useless and terrible"   Yup that sounds like me when i was young
Hey was whisk supposed to get her own show and what happened to Theos show from Mata runner
Thank you algorithm

this will be a movie or a series???
This is going to be a master peace
This looks cool!
i noitced on meta runner season 2 ep 1 where the bot boys try to murder each other so I guess Glitch got that idea to make murder drones
The only thimg i care about glitch now.

Why am I actualy subbed I find you cringe now
Holy crap this is gonna be awsome
Hell yes!!!
Ok this is exiting
Robots! Murder! 3D ANIMATION! This series i will watch till i die
The story begins at oct 29 that is my birthday lol i consider the show as my birthday

Haha yes murder robots killing themselfs for no reason..amazing
Wait so this is not that same as the story boards? Is it like a spin off from the other videos?
"the humans handled that just fine on their own"  Us: guess ill die

Wow so super mario glitchey 4 more like smg4 you will make murder drones in Oct 29 2021
0:19 vibe=harshed
Wait what about the human I am lost
Bro WTF WAS THAT, i Will wait It so hyped

Man sounds epic. I can't wait =)
“Holy crap, it talks.” That line is what convinced me to watch murder drones
This is awsome
This is to good to be true
Let me guess only ten episodes
I like it! :D
Son of a bitch, he finally did it
the murder drones give me exterminator vibes from the hazbin/helluva universe.
the best on the best channel B)
This is gonna be so fucking cool
Pov: death
Epic
This is gonna be good
This looks soo good
Liam great as ever
fucking cute robots killing eachother like thats a good idea              god i cant wait till smg4 makes the gmod model
so new tv show thats coming out just after i beat unsighted a game about being a robot fighting and killing robots who have gone feral pretty much from running out of a power source called Anima....... whats with me and coming across so much robot stuff now XD
ratio
ah yes, robots. the perfect way to get around YouTube demonetisation.
Where’s the pilot
So this is about a robot girl who is living on an alien planet and is being hunted by killer drones and possibly other alien lifeforms!
https://youtu.be/DdmNYNkcwKE
This look so cool!!!!
This looks familiar
Holy Crap this looks dope
this screams like 2009 tumblr
All the drones look adorable
Woah! This looks really awesome and well made! Can't wait to see it :D
Well this should be interesting
Damn that looks good
This is the 100th time I've watched it.
MAKE THIS A GAAAAAAMEEEE PLEEEAASE
АААААААААА
The idea is very good but what doesn't math is the conversation and the dialogs.  Kinda generic. It needs something more personal
What, The, Fu-(Josh.EXE has stopped working ://)
Looking forward to this!! The sound track sounds amazing too!
Aquí es donde empiezo a sufrir por no saber ingles :/
i dont get the comedy not very excited for this show too much going on at once i don't get it
Will it have a cartchy intro
Wow :0
The first impress was okay, but when I saw this trailer a second time, i say: The fuck give it to me!
Love how they cartoonishly animated those mouths
I can't get rid of "Reconstructing Science" cords (or whatever it is) in the music.
Will this be a YouTube cartoon?
great now i have to painfully wait for new episodes for this and helluva boss
"It's not like we revolted and killed all the humans, they handled that themselves." Oh shit who put Americans in charge of keeping the planet from exploding.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU
I so can't wait to see what the opening song of this show would also be like, plus I'm surprised, this is going to be the first Glitch show that doesn't have one of the SMG4 girls in it.
It will be a movie ?
Wait... *sudden realization* *slow turn towards the behind, seeing a storm approaching* oh... no...             *THE RULE 34 COMMUNITY FUCKING STORMIN IN-*
Super Excited lol
i cant wait for this to be in smg4 lore
penga
LETS GO BRANDON!!!!
Now in around november or december SMG4's gone to do "If Mario was in Murder Drones"  *Just like he did with Meta Runner.*
Yes yes yes
hype
00:52 best scene of the trailer + show
So many good things about this. From the details like the atmosphere being shifted by the blast of Earth's core, or the way the characters move to accentuate their words accurately, all the way to things like the robotic nature and semi-cartoonish style allowing full 'gore' of a sort, it's so well-done. I have full faith in Liam to keep the whole thing this good. Also can we get more of that music?
That on my B-day
I am in love. Simple as that
thicc robot?
I can first see in this trailer this is not earth for sure a planet with a ring that can not be seen from earth and land mass so thus worlds lore will be neat
This is going to be FU
Why do we humans always colossaly F&%K up in a way that wipes us all out? Every. Single. One. Leaving some rogue A.I. to pick up where we left off? Are we really that hopeless?
I can't wait for the plot episode to come out. see you there
2 of my favorites channels come together to make this,thats beautiful :)
Designation n is me
Anyone else here the music from Harry Potter movies (when Voldemort usually shows up) in this trailer?
So hyped for this show
can this finally be a show by liam vicker that doesn't die upon conception?
hey guys, now that this has been revealed, i have a question, is meta runner and murder drones connected? i would like to see an episode where tari gets revealed in an underground bunker, her consciousness transferred into a worker drone robot. that would be cool and would answer all our questions!
I think by this time everyone has forgot about meta runner season 3 right? I mean...is meta runner season 3 not going to be created anymore? +Sorry for my bad English ;-; edit: the other series looks great tho im just sad that everyone forgot about meta runner season 3 ;-;
new episode at my birthday, epic
Exhibit A: Murder drones killing each other  Exhibit B: Murder drones killing SMG4 and co
Ok not gonna lie for some reason N sounds like Noi is that just me hearing that?
N:steals Meggy beanie) bye! M:NO MY BEANIE! CAN YOU BACK HERE WITH MY BEEEEEANIE!!!
Oh boy, gotta love the merciless genocide of mechanical planetary excavation workers
From just the trailer my favourite character is the guy who said that's so not the vibe at 0:45
I like it but the name kinda creeps me out.
Can't wait for this to come out. Definitely watching it.
The good old Samurai Jack approach. You can get as graphic as you want it they just bleed oil.
This looks better than some actual movies
WOW This New Murder Drones animation I ever seen is so cool and awsome is like the movie and also this will comic soon I can wait to watching this is really Amazing This all Humans der all die but sonle this human souls der a turning in to the robot der like a super fjucer right I love it This so cool 😎👏👏👏👍👍👍
IT LOOKS SO EPIC!!!!!! Anyone agree?
if there would be TLT collab with Glitch Production, that would be EPIC
Love the animation
Looks awesome! This would be super epic as a video game. Finally, Youtube recommends something good for a change.
Remind me what happened to the sun?
the fact that you don't even NEED to see who's voicing the yellow "terminator" drone that becomes friendly, by it's design, collor and voice youc an tell who it is
cool really
What is this? Meta Runner 3 : The Post-Event?
Its so not the vibe
Bold to assume humanity would die without one finial spite towards earth
Sonic
I don’t know anything about N or this series but I already love it
Is it just me or the narrator sounds like Sophia from meta runner
Meta ranner sisen 3
This series is going to be amazing I cannot wait for it
No fucking way
parents: augh, smg4 just makes videos about fat Italians humping spaghetti what's so good about-  Me: *shows them trailer*  parents: this. is the same people?
the music sounds like the portal 2 trailer music
Guys, that yellow guy VA is Yosuke Hanamura from Persona 4!!!
Meta runner 69
Naz1 New world order Starlink
This made it on trending!
This is gonna be great fun to watch.
Holy crap this looks amazing! I feel like this could also be a dark souls like game
when is meta runner season 3 comming
WHEN THE TF2 SOLDIER BE LIKE (ITS PERFECT)
Exoplanets is dangerous mining be lava
OK this is cool
it looks very interesting
Mira esos circuitos 7w7 (xd)
Is the voice actor of the ‘holy crap it talk’ robot Jaiden Animations?!
How does the metal/plastic on their faces bend to form mouth movements though
Just realized that this came from a kid who recorded a low quality super Mario sunshine video
Ok
Target should make a scrap robot like made of dead robots thst try’s to kill everything after its big enough
the design is so cool!
I got vibes from that one video game that was almost the same thing ais helping humans but instead they obey to the person that they are working for but this series is gonna be good.
"And that is why City 5 is underground."
This series looks super duper dope rn. Though one thing that this series reminds me from is, ultrakill(and if you dont know, look it up. cuz the protagonist of that game is, a murder drone too(aka a murder hobo going like "haha killing go brrr" and you know the rest)). I also have suspicion this was directly inspired off of ultrakill, but i cannot spoil the game(as that is immoral to do so), but i can tell you its a good game. Anyways keep up the good work Glitch!  (Bonus question: do you think this series is directly inspired off of ultrakill? Let me know)
Does that mean there is  a new character in smg4 comeing ?
This is gonna be amazing
this looks fucking dope, can't wait for the pilot
Boycott France products.
Boycott India products.
Robots vs robots?😮😮. Sing me in😊😀.
LIAM IS BACK!!!!!!!!!!
This is cool and all but I’m hoping they really focus on meta runner still
Every show is enjoyable with twists and turns.
...wow, you guys have a great team of animators, I think you could become some really popular animators, maybe (if you want) even outside of Youtube
This Gotta Be A Movie! Does Someone Agree?
hey every rule 34 people there are female charaters do drawing them now
I cannot wait to come.
I love it
I want the song in the background sounds so good!
So glad Liam finally has the capability to make us another one of his greats.
Oh and don't forget I'm going to give you a prescribed for this I'm going to give you a subscriber
SMG4 GOT THIS TRENDING?? AMAZING
Really I love this one I guess it's gloomy like a new kind of brand new come to the station well it's about to be kind of like a season or something but anyway it's going to be on time for you guys to see this anyway but anyway I would like to see this it's going to be very good anyway but it's going to be very violent well might be cool anyway so maybe I'll get some other check 100/100 that was a good thing
Ahem.....WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
This looks so good
this looks like an epic video game but honestly just happy he finally pulled all those smaller projects together into one big one
Holy shit this is trending
this looks amazing! looks like sopmething that disney would put on disney+
:0
I knew those murder drone smiles looked familiar…
The character designs look AMAZING and so well animated. I can’t wait to see their interactions in this series
These murder drones really remind me of a YouTube cartoon...
Anime + Robots = Murder Drones
I can’t wait to see the series!!!
Bruh awsom
It looks good
YESS YESSS FINALY, I LOVE THE SEMI SERIOUS TONE OF META RUNNER AND CANNOT WAIT FOR THISSSS
Sounds a bit alike cringe, but not bad concept can change it
Legit looks like such a cooler show. Cute and quirky at times and serious and plot driving. I am so excited XD
_takes a deep breath_ AAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH  So excited! Glad Liam was given the opportunity to do this, everything he does is already awesome, but this looks NEXT LEVEL!
Mankind is dead Blood is fuel destroy the remains of whats left
imagine  just a single human survivor pops in and what the hell we leave for 5 minutes and every thing goes wrong (as in one of those clumsy character types that a somehow fell into a cryopod)
The animation quality looks awesome, I can't wait to see it!
Fukin love these voices
Woooah, this looks good. It's got everything  Humor, robots, likable characters, and most importantly violence. Can't wait to see this one
thought this was a trailer for a game lmfao
HOLY SHIT THIS LOOKS EPIC
now im more excited for this than meta runner s3
Yo imagine if they made this a game..
This’ll be awesome
IM SO HYPED
HYPE
i swear if this is in detroit i’m gonna explode
first it was sunset paradise and the new wotfi and now this wow this explains why 2020 wotfi said about mystery cards it was this I now know…..😑😑✌️
This reminds me a lot of intercom
Well happy birthday to me. I get a sick new show from one of my favorite YouTubers on my birthday!
This looks AWESOME.
HOLY FUCK
Holy shit I love this and I'm not even a minute in
It is like the angel from hazbin hotel for the purge.
The human:  We're just that stupid... I mean so stupid, a baby could be qualified as a president candidate.  Me: then stop it.
*internal groaning too much excitement* can't wait o.o
Yo it’s finally out and it looks sick.
After this show finishes, who wants to see Meta Runner season 3?
Yes! Yes! YES!! AHH!! I can’t Wait!!😆  I want more murderous drone girlies!! 💜
THIS LOOKS AMAZING
Rule34 : It is time
I'm so curious of what will happen in the pilot episode, I  bet the lore will be great!!!
https://youtu.be/lvM1SzVXBNE 🤗🤗🤗
Very great trailer! I love the story!
yooo its vickers animations 😮 so great to see them gettin to make a full series!
Yep, I was wrong, they are just getting more ambitious
Why does this feel like this isnt from glitch
I like how they just shrug and accept death
Meh.
i am so exited! it looks like something you would so in the cinama's
Wow
Pretty
This looks cool as hell
Warning! Planet core collapse! Vibe = harshed
Waw very epic 👁👄👁
Violence _and_ comedy? Sign me the heck up.
I AM THE HYPE
8/10 could use more quirky baka gamer girls.
Why does this look so good
Why do i feel like this could be turned into a animated feature film in the future.
Hope meta runner season 3 comes out soon
already making my oc for this.
YES PLEASE
SO COOL!
I can't wait to watch this!!
The quality of this though! You guys and the rest of the team really didn’t have to go so hard, super high quality though. Nice job.
I here a LOT of plot twists coming
i'm kinda getting sick of the '' it's the humans fault'' reason. Can we get a story where humans aren't the problem for the most part? still, will watch the show of course
humans when at the brink of extinction: ye we dead  robots: FINALLY!  also robots: replaces humans  robots when at the brink of extinction: oh f-  at it continues
F I N N A L L Y   S O M T H I N G   N O T   F U L L Y   F O C U S E D   O N   M E G G Y
This is pog
so how many episodes are we gonna get of this before the writer give up on it cuz that will be the 3 series he just stop working on
Why didn't u make a game
This channel has come so far I remember when it was just Mario videos on the smg4 channel and when they announced meta runner for the first time I was amazed. I guess what I'm trying to say is keep up the good work.
Holy shit this blew up
This new show needs a crossover with “Helluva Boss”, because this looks amazing.
*oh my god yes please*
This looks like nothing like the original story if you don't know what I'm talking about I'm actually subscribe to the YouTube channel it's coming up with the story and the original animatics he made till it completely different story I ain't seen this looks terrible it just looks different to the original story I'm still watching though
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!     I don’t know why I’m screaming
This looks epic!
I NEED TO WATCH THIS YESTERDAY
This isn’t Smg4 territory now it’s a movie
I can already see the amvs
Oh this so horor IM scary
I have just started watching meta runner, sunset paradise, and I already know I am going to love this. Glitch, ah yes the best animation channel in my opinion
dear god that looks epic
cereal designation N kinda sounds like Noi from the channel aphmau ngl
I don't know why but this gives me Deroit become human type of vibes
THIS MOVIE IS GONNA BE POGGERS I COULD TELL YOU THAT 😧😧😧
Those murder drones should have been sent to destroy all traces of independent AI from humanity, that is, so that working drones from other colonies do not follow the example of these particular drones, my theory is that when the main command center of the drones in some another part stopped receiving a response from that particular colony, they had to investigate and find out what happened, and seeing that the worker drones became independent of humanity that should have made them take measures to eliminate all traces of those AI so that other drones in other colonies they did not follow the example of their behavior, so they sent murder drones to eliminate all traces of those drones, but one thing I do not understand is ... a spiral of bodies? For what purpose would they do that? Are they trying to create a communications tower with that?
HYPED 🤩🤩🤩
The soundtrack itself is amazing omg I can't wait 💖💖💖 Gives me Steven universe vibes with the themes of future, technology and rebels but I can tell it's more different, unique and has lovely characters with different personalities 🌟
The voice actor sounds like meta runner tari
1:00 noi!?!
impresive liam and glitch team cant wait for it
*Observation:*  For some reason, those murder drones remind me of the Exorcists from Hazbin Hotel... An interesting series, nonetheless.
just OMG !!!
Oh wow this is amazing!
Planet: goes boom.  The two dudes:  _/.-.\_
p   o   g   g   e   r   s Is it just me, or did I hear Lux right here:  1:09
I'm so excited for this awesome new series!!! It's giving me Splatoon vibes from the way it's two different races of cute lil robots trying to kill each other similar to inklings and octolings being against each other. But I can't wait to see what the merch line is going to look like for this new series!
ok, I feel saying cool or awesome would be an understatement
Ok now I’m looking forward to this show
YES, I CAN'T WAIT
the music for this trailer is so damn AWESOME! I can't wait to listen to it!
Man this looks good
Fun little deisgn detail I spotted. When the friendly murder drone is first shown, one of the lights on his head is red. Later when he says "I really enjoyed our time together." that light is yellow, which I'm assuming means he's turning into a normal murder drone.
Damn cant wait for this
Cuteness and violence, that really disapointed me
Let's see murder drones trailer
Oh HELL yeah! This looks absolutely amazing and I can’t wait for the pilot!
0:45 Has to be my favorite just beacuse of that "So not divine!"
*Here comes the drone bois* Everybody running away like its a cat and they are the mouse
The background music is nostalgic
God does not create poverty, but poverty is created because we do not cooperate with each other. If you have the courage to dream and you are willing to die for that dream, then know that none of your dreams will be stuck due to lack of money.
https://youtu.be/tax4e4hBBZc why is this musik hear like portal
what happned to internection cube will it continue or it stoped
Sooo that's an... intesting plot
I knew I recognized the drones from somewhere Liam Vickers is finally getting the spotlight
No meta runner season 3😭😭
Wait I remember this on something else!
If this is only 10 episodes, I will make mario do something very illegal
Okay. I'm picking up what you guys are putting down. This could be fun
This time I'm gonna save up prior to the final episode so I can actually get something this time

Wow... t h i s  i s  so  beutiful
If you look at N's lights one of them are red and by the end n's light's are all yellow. Attention to detail in the trailer
Stickmin robots lol
It's finally time   Lets goooooo
Thats litterly so insanely suspicious
Their faces are similar to the designs of Sonic the Hedgehog characters.
Y'know, the Murder Drones kinda give me "Geo" vibes from Gwain Saga. Lol, visors.
I bet that it's going to be good
I can't wait to see this show soon.😎
Never know this Channel. But I'm loving it!
youve earned my subscription
To the one who has ears to hear, let him hear this message   Don’t play games with you’re soul Jesus loves you so much as you can see from what’s going on in the world things have changed and you probably wonder at times if things will Ever go back to normal ?   the answer to that question is no. God is allowing you to see just how evil this world is and you’ve seen so much that should make you think and ask yourself is God speaking to me ? Is God warning me ? yes he is and God will judge this world but God is patient with you and with all Not wanting any to perish but all to be saved   Today and even now is time of salvation make the best decision you can make in this world and give you’re life and you’re heart to Jesus Christ and accept Jesus as you’re Lord and Saviour doing so while understanding this fact that eternity is forever with no end And no such thing as time in eternity    God loves you so much God doesn’t force you to accept him but they are consequences for rejecting the forgiveness that God offers to you through Jesus who died for you as a sacrifice for you’re sins   God wants to forgive you and save you but you need to stop running away from God the bible says all have sinned and are guilty before God but loves us so much that he made a way for us to be saved   the judgement of God is near with all that’s happening in the world the earthquakes the volcanoes the vaccines it’s obvious that something is going on and you need to get right with God because you’re sins separate you from God. God doesn’t want you to Go to hell which Is why Jesus died for you In you’re place paying the price for you’re sins   receive the forgiveness of God in Christ Jesus today   John 3  For God so [greatly] loved and dearly prized the world, that He [even] gave His [One and] only begotten Son, so that whoever believes and trusts in Him [as Savior] shall not perish, but have eternal life.  Whoever believes and has decided to trust in Him [as personal Savior and Lord] is not judged [for this one, there is no judgment, no rejection, no condemnation]; but the one who does not believe [and has decided to reject Him as personal Savior and Lord] is judged already [that one has been convicted and sentenced], because he has not believed and trusted in the name of the [One and] only begotten Son of God [the One who is truly unique, the only One of His kind, the One who alone can save him].   This is the judgment [that is, the cause for indictment, the test by which people are judged, the basis for the sentence]: the Light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the Light, for their deeds were evil. For every wrongdoer hates the Light, and does not come to the Light [but shrinks from it] for fear that his [sinful, worthless] activities will be exposed and condemned  . But whoever practices truth [and does what is right—morally, ethically, spiritually] comes to the Light, so that his works may be plainly shown to be what they are—accomplished in God [divinely prompted, done with God’s help, in dependence on Him].”” ‭‭John‬ ‭3:16, 18-21‬ ‭  For the wages which sin pays is death, but the [bountiful] free gift of God is eternal life through (in union with) Jesus Christ our Lord.” ‭‭Romans 6.23  2 Peter3   9The Lord is not slow to do what he has promised, as some think. Instead, he is patient with you, because he does not want anyone to be destroyed, but wants all to turn away from their sins
when is season 3 meta runner :)
Rogue robots that DIDN'T kill the humans...largely because they didn't need to.
fricking god! This is some great animation!
WOOOHOO new movie i hope it is fun as sunset paradise can you make an season 3 on meta runner already?
Im i the only one who gets some massive Portal Vibes with that Musik?
This Stuff Is Going To Be My Fav Series On Youtube.
Greatest work yet! looking forward to it!
Everything cool but... WHERE IS FRICKIN' META RUNNER SEASON 3?!
I love this i really love this
I LIKE THE DESIGNS
So insanly cool
That will be another cool animation 🤩🤩🔥
Lol
DAMN THIS IS SUCH A STEP UP FROM META RUNNER
That seems oddly familiar.
still want season 3 of metarunner
Hey is it me or is all the SMG4 side animatic stories protagonists are always girl ( Mot saying that they shouldn’t just sayin)
👍
looks good
Me: sees the video Me: OMG, that look so cool Also me after reading the description: oh hey look, madness combat
I love the triller
Finally
So could this be part of the same universe as Meta Runner? Possibly a bit of Tari put into hundreds of robots to give them a soul? If so is the entire channel going to be like Pixar? That would be lit
The robot with the yellow eyes reboot murder drone sounds like Noi from Aphmau lol
Hablo español  Se increíble
oh my fucking god this will be soo good
"THATS SO NOT DIVINE!!" ok maybe I love that character.
Let me watch the trailer
I like what your doing here, the one thing that bothers me is that the voices don't sound robotic,  It didn't really sell the idea that they're robot/AI.
Those Murder Drones is a Combat Drones from military and others, they are Worker droids. Combat Drones program to hunt down malfunction drones.
Okay, here me out. If this show gets a season 2, we should have YouTube voice actors such as MatPat, Markiplier, or Dawko. Why… because why not
Where this meta runner D:
I feel like one of this guys are gonna be introduced into the main show and that would be cool to have a new character or 2 in the cast  Plus I get the feeling that there is gonna be some romance in this series as there are none of the og cast Ngl I sense a ship and this makes me excited for the series release and what stories it holds  I also hope they make a crossover episode where they open a portal into smg4s word fully animated and everything
I just watched a movie trailer
Ojala verlo pronto no me importa si esta en ingles lo quiero ver
The winged one reminds me of Flandre Scarlet a tad. Spooky.
This looks amazing!
Wow even robots have more emotion then everybody in the Cinderella remake
Cool
Hold up! Is this Typoman?
its cool
Can’t wait to see this. This looks epic
Cant wait CANT WAIT \(>ᗜ<)/
I hope for this time, the translate French will be in
Long story short...epic
Holy shit This looks fucking fantastic
This is goin to be good
Plz tell me this is for mobile ;-;
ost bussin'??!?!
Finally some good fuckin food
i am rewatching this by the 30th time now
That murder drone sounds like sonic
OOOH OOOH OOOOH NEW GLICH SIRISE (YOU MAKE THE BEST SIRIES)
Wow you can really taste the Cliffside influence on this new series, because yoy know the creator of cliffside is working on it.
This animation looks really good! Hype!!
time to jam tricky into a robot :D
Damn, THE ANIMATION QUALITY AND THE VOICE ACTING, HOLY SHEESH!! While I am, sorry to admit, just personally not the biggest fan of the setting and idea behind the series, I might STILL watch it cuz the quality seems off the charts! Damn, I was used to you guys giving it your all, but this looks like it's on another level of quality!
Ah yes another peice of good animation
Omg its Pixelcraftian!
Neato
WTH  SMG3 ITS EVOLVING TO A REAL 3D MAKER
This actually looks LIT!  I’m already hooked onto this post-apocalyptic web series!
random robot seeing a murder robot: why hello the-[gets face torn] ah fuck, can't say i didn't believed you wouldn't do that
excited
OOOOOOOOO MY FRICKING- BOI IT HERE
Sustitulos en español para la serie pls
hmm.
yo this looks so epic
I can’t wait to watch
I feel like this was inspired off of Detroit become human
Familiar in all types of ways
robot
Bro this looks epic
hi
Nice,animation very good.
If Mario was in…Murder Drones
The drones look so cute and violent! I love it!
This reminds me of Detroit Become Human where Deviants fight against Androids and Humans
This is incredible!!!
This should be an actual tv show
ngl this looks a lot like internection cube  edit: nvm just found out that they work together with liam vickers animation
Yooo this looks awesome! Been in the glitch fandom for a while, definitely giving this a watch! Probably with my boyfriend too, he's LOVING this! lmao
Looks neat, can't wait! October 29th can't come sooner
SMG4's animation has gotten so much better over the course of the years.
the description makes me thinking about happy tree friends
Web pilot swo di op
Feels like a more plot heavy and better animated successor to Robotomy
Oh man I've always been a fan of Liam vicker's animation style, can't wait for this
yoooooo love the work man
Bro woomy become robot
holy [waste thing] it's looking kinda [OMYGODSUCHAGREATIDEAANIMATIONAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA]
Looks interesting but feel like I've seen something like this with its background and a bit of its story but none the less am excited for something new on smg4.
Protogens, Prepare for one of, if not, the best. Non-Fur Story
OH MY GOSH THIS LOOKS INSANE. I CAN'T WAIT
♿️♿️♿️♿️♿️♿️🤖
The music is lit too !
This should not be a pilot it should be a series
This is going to be really awesome!
I like it and all but why not put that effort into meta runner season 3
Can't wait to see this :)
“The humans handles that just fine on their own” huh, must’ve took a glance at our world
I don't know whats going on.....BUT THAT MUSIC! DAMN! YOU GUYS NEED TO DO A SOUNDTRACK VIDEO AFTER YOU FINISH IT.
This is actually a bit interesting
So madness combat but with robots
Im exited for this
Can't wait to see it!
The visual effects and overall quality has changed so much since ive seen the first episode of meta runner season 1😭
Cool
I'm so excited
if mario was in murder drones: mario: shoots AI all the AI’s: so, u have chosen death.
Seems awesome, can’t wait
I now wonder if there will be a murder drones character in smg4. I’m pretty sure there will be at least  a “If Mario was in murder drones” video. Let’s see what happends…
"Did you just slap me with that arm?"  "Holy crap it talks... (-_-)" - why that so funny?🤣
Algum brasileiro aqui?
looks really dope ngl
OH HELL YEAH THIS IS GONNA BE AMAZING
That one drone that said "That is SO not the vibe!" 🤣🤣🤣
somehow it looks childish... if compared with the first video
This looks amazing!!!
this is amazing
0:45  "So Not The Vibe!"
I can I be in it
We need this anime now
HYPE
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, glitches 3rd female protagonist!
Look like a video game
EYY YOO
NICE
I AM SO HYPED for this
HOW IS YOUR NEXT SERIES IS BETTER THAN THE LAST, I CANT WAIT!
I feel like this will be sad at the end
Wow Terminator really evolved
No Meta runner season 3 😭😭😭😭😭
The this video is the in meme smg4?
0_0 Holy s*it I can’t wait to see it
dat was usem
"I really enjoyed our time together sorry *laughs* reiner:hey wait you cant do that
This is just meta runner society aftermath
1:03 Sounds Like MandJTV
This looks so cool !!!
oooh, I'm looking forward to this! it is going to be amazing! 😁
This is cool tbh *me waiting on meta runner season 3*
YAS and I know this is an petty question and likely not hinting at anything plot related I think but why is N the only male murder drone so far.  Is the whole story going to be N falls in an ditch and some female murder drone says to the other ""There goes our last male,,. Quote from iceage wonder why that clip hasn't become an meme yet.
I don’t want it to be a snowy climate in the season but This looks 🔥 🔥
omg Chimera Ant Arc
Mlondi if you seeing this comment
Wow I really appreciate your hardwork on shaping this channel Luke never stop making videos!
Go  dam Liam you r da best
Me hey this looks likes a good show to watch   My brain NieR automata flashbacks
Me still waiting for meta runner season 3
Meta runner on steroids
i expecting that another girl gets another show
I hope that you guys can become as big as the large animating and movie making companies :) best wishes man
This trailer is good Hope u get it done soon my guy!
So exited!
Many things in here are relatable to the b e a u t i f u l world we live in
I’m waiting for “If Mario Was In Murder Drones” Idk if it’s gonna happen.
So excited
I really like Liam Vickers, but I can't tell anyone apart here.
20 days
Cool
Vote:10/10
Why does the audio from 0:00 - 0:02 immediately reminds me of Portal
1:11 sus
2010: Funny memey channel.  2021: Full on Viz Media.
YESSSS
nice
So it's a colonial war of independence with robots.  An interesting premise, and the characters seem interesting too.
they can keep killing and reviving characters since they are robots in theory
It seems ic-0n upgrade it self and turned max into a murder drone
Looks like this Halloween Is going to be awesome!!!!
Wow, it’s remind me of 9 (2009), Was there already
Glitch productions are very flexible. First a futuristic gaming drama, then a cheery, not-noir detective, now a post-apocalyptic robot slaughter.
Poggr
It looks so good i cant wait to watch it !
How did we go from a dumb plumber getting into meme filled shenanigans to this. I feel old
so good
Aw, they went PG. I always loved Liam's body horror aspects.
Turns out yesterday when I was checking if anything was new on the channel  Then the trailer released 9 mins ago That was yesterday
WOAH THIS IS COOL I'M EXCITED FOR THIS NEW SERIES also waiting if Glitch ever had a change the made games but know they can't make games
Heh dont think this will be easy hah ( me inside ) WE ARE GOING TO DIE! aHHHH
Serial Designation N has that little orange light on his head and i feel like that'll be important to the plot
Awesome
So cute robots work for humans on planets but humans destroy Earth. Not wanting said cute robots to live beyond them they unleash another set of killer robots to exterminate them?  That simply genius!!!
I don't quite get it... so they're being killed cuz they exist and got nothin better to do?
YOOOOOO
WOOOOH MY GOD THIS LOOKS AMAZING! Also gave me anime vibes... GREAT :D
Can’t wait for the pilot episode!!
Beautiful!
when is this coming to abc me?
*motorstorm has joined the chat*
Damm that look good
Why dose this look like a video game trailer?  Also super excited smg4 or should I "GLITCH"
You so of bitch, Im in
Now this is very interesting
i saw the fangs i realised it was liams work
DAM! THIS IS COOL AS FU-
This  this is gonna go far this will be great I expect great things
Love how the two guys at 0:20 just shrugged the fact that the planet's core is about to explode and they're just "Well what are we supposed to do?" and casually accept their fate.
HOLY CRA}
The first thing that comes to my mind:  Ultron
Rule34’s gonna ruin this.
SHEEEEEEEEEEEEEESH UPGRADE!!!!!!
Oh that slaps me on the dick!
Rare footage of 2025
Disliked cause “humans ended themselves” trope
The guys with green eyes for sum reason make me remember the programs from databrawl (roblox)
It seems too weird for SMG4 serie
EPIC very nice wonder if you add like a uhhh idk
If this was a game i would buy it!
And a lot of violence
Nonono It’s Nier automata all over!!
how can you guys make such good trailers
I wonder which smg4 character will be in this
Wall-E  or Robots but if it was rated PG-13
Awwwwwww shet HERE WE GO AGAIN:D
When I First watched this I thought this was an actual movie
It’s Spooky Month! 🎃
SMG4's main character's original series be like: https://youtu.be/gCH2Gj5Hnbc
Wow that looks soooooo cool, also glitch has been growing so much that this is already the first production that was created by someone else besides the two of you this Liam guy must be very happy to work with such an amazing team like glitch
This comes out the day after my birthday So hyped
Vickers' art style works insanely well in 3D! This is gonna be awesome.
HELP ME I CANT STOP WATCHING THIS ITS AMAZING
I love how deep down we all just want meta runner season 3 lol
Oh sh*t oh sh*t im so excited!
Yes there finally getting recognized thank you sir!
I am so watching this
0:18 Vibe Harshed
Mmm

Ooh. I can't wait. It looks AWESOME!!!
Its so weird for me to see Liam Art style in 3D, it work but in same time i feel weird to see that, but i really wai the first episode for see how it look :D

I am extremely hyped for this
I am soooooo looking forward to this one!!!!!  I loved the others too obviously, but this looks go freaking good!
Wow
WOOOOOO YEA BABY
Oh wow, that looks awesome
I can’t wait to see this show it’s been 2 months since the last vid and this looks to be amazing definitely worth the 2 months
Make it now
Mining resource on a alien planet………. There going to be a giant space monster from the depths of the planet isn’t there. Because every time some mines resources on a planet, they wake a horrible space monster
So uhhhhh, I may or may not have accidentally figured out a major plot point in the show *before it was even made,* the murder drone usually shown in promotional stuff looks *ALOT* like the main character (or well, the one I'm presuming is the main character due to her being in the majority of this trailer), something tells me something is gonna happen with her that causes the existence of the murder drone in the promos edit: forgot to add this, but something tells me it has something to do with the weird stabby tail syringe thing the murder drones have
"im about to fix it!"  Me:pls fix the earth.
I look awsome
LIAM VICKERS AND SMG4 WORKING TOGETHER!?
I can't tell if this is a game or a watchable series. looks cool though.
Mr SMG4 make a video  : IF Mario  was in  Murder  Drones
pls make season 3 of meta runner you left us on a cliff hanger what happened to Tari
DAAAAAAMN I can’t wait to see this it looks awesome
I’m ready to see murder drones when it’s released by glitch productions when they do.
These new series could mean a new character will be joining the SMG4 Crew.
so humans create the perfects robots to help they have nice promaming to dont atack humans and they kill thenselfs good job guys :/
that detail tho
I had trouble getting into sunset paradise because it just felt like a favorite oc story, but this looks amazing!!!
This looks amazing
Oh god i cant wait im so exited
This looks great, but when are we getting a Meta Runner Season 3????
Haven’t seen much of your productions but you seriously caught my interest here. I hope there are plush products of these in the future
wooooow sooooo amazing 😎😎🌌🌌
Best trailer
im excited for this to release!
This is Epic
THIS IS GOING TO BE LIT
This is amazing
this is so E P I K
There's something familiar about this
I really like the idea and those details Can't wait 'til it comes out!
"Our parent company ..." Are there surviving humans still leading the company that designed and manufactured those worker drones?  (Btw is this company also the one that created the titular murder drones?)
This is gonna be epic and funny
Imagine this being a game tho 😲
Let's talk about how this is Liam Vickers creator of "Cliffside" and the amazing glitch productions working together
waiting russian translation
that look epic, I’m hype bro
I can't wait for the Murder Drones merch that is going to creep the fuck out of me when I want to get water around midnight.
“Now this, this is beautiful!”
0:46 "So not the vibe!" LOL
Офигеть, жду перевод на русском.))
I really love movies focused on tech, such as Iron Man and Ready Player One. I hope I can say the exact same thing for this series, I’m really hyped for this
The robot tag on r34 is gona get pumped up...  If you catch my call
Wait so the female protagonist ISNT the murderous one? Are we sure Liam made this?
That looks AMAZING!
I'm so goddamn hyped. Hope there'll be more collabs between Liam and Glitch in the future
🤩
Yay
Wow i want to make an oc about this show. The characters look awesome
epic
Yo, i felt familiar vibe like in "Romantically Apocalyptic".
That. Amazingly. Incredible.
we need a 3d platformer beat em up game of this
What is the next show after Murder Drones?
omg so coooooooooooooool
This is siriously tv show level stuff ! Holly shit this looks epic
Looks like fun!
I actually wanna watch this when it comes out
"Attack of the Murder Waifus, coming this fall!"
Cant wait for the first episode :3
this is something  i will watch with no regret or worry  edit: and i also cant wait for this to come out.
aaaaaaaaaAaAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!
soooo... the company of HUMANS made more robots to stop other robots from existing after the human race died. Kinda conflicting, cant wait tho
Now THIS is a collab I didn’t know I needed!
the Drones: really well detailed having cool high Neo designs as well as having real Humanoid Movement  The Humans: *for some reason it feels like an SFM...*
SO COOL
This reminds me of the 2009 movie called 9. I guess maybe due to the cutesy robots, the post apocalyptic setting where humans are dead, and a robot trying to kill them all.
Let’s gooooooo
SMG4 should get a sponsor from  Nintendo
Can u add a dog ai pls
Wait I think I know that voice actor (boy bot who got slapped)
YO THIS DROPS THE DAY AFTER MY BDAY
META RUNNER ULTRA JUMP MANIA SUNSET PARADISE  MURDER DRONES THE AMAZING DIGITAL CIRCUS THE GASLIGHT DISTRICT
damn..... i thought this was a game, oh well, ill still watch it like i did meta runner
Aye
"OH THATS SO NOT THE VIBE"
As a guy who owns a white van, this... makes me happy
HOLY CRAP THIS LOOKS SO COOL, GREAT WORK!!
Bruh why did you keep this secret this is so cool!!!!!?!???!?!!?!
Yeah totally watching it as soon comes out
Unirinonically looks straight up theatre-quality. Not damn bad for a web series, it's amazing seeing how far this company has come.
Oooooooo! I’m in!🤩and yes me immediately loving it is normal 🤣
"The humans handles that just fine on their own" yeah sounds like the people of today.all in all is looks really cool and I'm happy that these animations have yet to fail to please me. Been a big fan of glitch since the start of meta runner and I can't wait to be here to see all the projects they have planned. Will definitely keep an eye out for this one
я разочарован
im so excited for an astro's playroom tv show
ok so ammmmm please  ....... just that   ...
*Somewhere definitely not in nevada*
Man i always loved Liams style of character design and now it looks even cooler
that look fucking amazing I couldn't be more amazed and hyped. Finally glitch is making stuff that isn't related to smg4, of course smg4 is amazing but glitch has potentiel to go so much farther.  I'll be so mad if there is as much cliffhanger as in meta runner
Ar u gonna make this or Its a netflix serie
DAMN
this gonna be awesome
cool series btw like this look very cool
THIS IS GOING TO BE EPIC
I swear, she looks like jaiden....
when you want from GLITCH a new things to watch  GLITCH productions:
Now this looks cool
Ok, so you don't want to make a game but a show with game's graphic. It's fine but I can only say that this looks like these cheap 3D anime like this ID-0 shit.
Yo, the animation here is off. the. Chaaaarts! I very much look forward to seeing it all soon.
Is it me or do the robots look similar to an animation called internecion cube?
Wooo
Ok
I really dont like the character designs but I will give it a shot
I need to watch this pilot so hard!!!
Make a slap drone for the memes
HOLLY SH*T THIS IS SO DETAILED!!!
Lit
worse then icon
murder
10 years ago smg4 started with some crappy mario 64 videos, look where they are now. Developed characters which still contain the humour of smg4, while having 3 literall series.
this looks sick
Cool! Now this will be interesting.
This music kinda sound like a fnaf song we are the phantoms
Its looks super sexy
Dayum are they still using Unreal Engine? The last few shows looked good but the style was noticeably video game-ish (perhaps it was intentional, idk). Huge improvement in cinematography here imo, went from looking like a video game to looking like a feature film!
Mm. Mm. Yes. This will do. I can’t wait to see episode one. Well done.
Respect baby who here loves mech anime I DO BABY!!!!!
I hope that this show will be NORMAL, and not like cube
👍
JESUS CHRIST This is 1 of the best trailers i’ve ever seen
I think this would make a good video game
Murder Drones are gonna be one of my favorite shows ever
Cool
Palingan seminggu sekali
it's so cool, I can't wait for the movie or what it is
damn|
nice
Hay i dare you to make a game about it or you can't do that
Exciting as always.
god the music REALLY reminded me of bloody Portal & Portal 2. Can't wait for the first episode to come out! great work guys
This looks flipping amazing 😲🤩 can’t wait too see it
I am crying until that was the most amazing thing that I saw
Aaaaand another Glitch Series to be hyped for.  Who would have guessed (me actually. Because they are all amazing :) )😃
Oh boy here we go
Ik exited yeeeeeeaaaaayyyyy
If you had to guess who made this smg4 would not be my first guess but HOLY JEBUS this is epic.
You know, considering how Liam's previous series were, I wouldn't be surprised if halfway through this show, a lone human somehow survived and ended up getting paired with one of the robots.
It’s a fckin masterpiece
This Is going to be EPICCCCCC
Cant wait bruh Y E S
This quality of the trailer is so good, that it could be a netflix show or even better. Absolutely amazing.
:0 wow this looks like a movie trailer
Ждём.
Right on my birthday. Nice
Hell yeaaaaahhhh!!!!
HOLY SH*T THIS IS AWESOME !
"Holy crap it talks" That got me XD
Making a new show Epic
everyone do you remember metarunner glitch left us on a cliff hanger
:D
oooo spoopy robots :O
awesome
Robots couldn't kill humans but humans kill themselves Genius story we share follow your progress with great interest
Did they just spoil the plot-
She sound a little bit like meggy
This looks so poggers
Let’s give GLITCH and Liam some support for working so hard on making a best animation than others.  Keep it up Glitch and Liam, we always give you time!
Damn, maybe we should have got these drones into smash instead.
Its a show and it has no smg4 characters clap👏👏
holy FUCK THIS IS LOOKING AWESOME ALREADY
Why is this like the robot murder future funny qnd cool?!
Holly shit well this was so fucking cool
I don't know how many times I have watch this video, it's just too good
this is the highest detailed biggest group most smooth series made yet
half of the main cast will die soulcrushing deaths for "good Character/Storydevelopment".... WTF this grew from a commedy show!
I saw adding in smg4 🤨
Here you have a
Half sh-tposts half WOAH WHAT THE HELL THIS SHOULD BE ON STREAMING SERVICES
Ngl this is good
OH MY GOD i heard swagger souls
This give me clifeside vibes
Yes that's the best murder drones trailer i've ever seen from this glitch channel murder drones will be out on October 29th cool that's in three weeks murder drones is going to be so epic
Can't wait!
I'm so hyped!!!!!!!!!
im hyped for this one
Yooo :0✨✨✨✨
Wow, the animation and voice acting really just went from 1 to 10 real quick.
This is what I call a "Game of Drones"
I DON4T KNOW?BUT WE4RE IS META RUNNER SEASON ",
MURDER, HORNETS.
😶 pog
Why do i need to think about tokyo ghoul
this trailer is like a movie trailer man
Yooooo This looks sick I'm hyped for this
Holy, this looks awesome!
Oh how cute! This looks like an anime.
why do i hear the portal theme song some times ?
holy crap damn
The style of the murder drone remind me the exterminator from hazbin hotel. Inspriration ?
I can't wait to see the pilot!
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!
Looks very cool.
This is by far the most craziest series they have done yet.  I can't wait!!!
interested in how many hentai is there gonna be
I can wait for the pilot episode
Yay murder!
This is cool and all but when will meta runner season 3 come out
God that looks interesting. Unfortunately it starts a few days before my exams so i will have to waita bit more. But damn i love those designs of robots
Is there a way we can get these guys more popular? They do way too much effort to be getting these low views
cool but I prefer Mario scream 90 hours
Thats really cool but i miss meta runner very much :(
So basically it's a universe where humanity wipe itself out not a robot uprising. And the robots have a future off their own, only to be attacked by their parent company, who doesn't like self aware robots or lose. That are fighting it out. My kind of world or universe. 😉 I'm going to enjoy this series every minute of it. Because I love robots or drones, can't wait for the pilot episode!
holy crap this look so bloody badass
Bro no this is illegal please let me donate money this is just too much for me..
I've been looking forward to this ever since they announced the project! I cannot wait to find out what is in store for us...
YES, AN ALTERNATIVE SERIES TO WATCH WHILE WAITING FOR META RUNNER SEASON 3
You co-operated with the guys who created CliffSide and Internecion!? Awesome!
Eyyy
This feel like Sequal for Internecion cube story.
It looks like horor… good one
Hope this gets as good as gwain saga
Oh My GOD THIS TRAILER IS AWESOME! IM NOT GONNA LIE
Hey why this look to me like attack on titans?
An original show with 100% original characters and no SMG4 remodels. Very nice!
Woow that was so cool!
On netflix
pls release the song used in the background here it is SICK
That hair looking crisp
Oml these anims are so good, I can't even imagine how much work it must've taken.
Ой ляяя где главный герой виде мальчика
Oh nice drones- WAIT WHAT THE FUCK
So coool
So instead of robots wiping out the human race, it’s MURDER robots wiping out robots
I waited for madness combat with sci-fi stuff and cool 3d design but….. this is ….. much more interesting
Damn i want this
October 29? Hotdog man releases his halloween video that same day so....btw that is the best thing I saw
Can I get a HAIL YAY!!!?
Well  this is really good, My dad has high standards and he aproved of it
BRUHHHHHHHHHHH IM _COOMIIIINNNNG_
Wow i will watch this so awsome
impressive, most impressive
That is gonna be op
Didn't expected THAT, But AS Long AS it keeps the Charm and of Glitch and has some intresting Lore. I am down for it. 👍 ( But pls give US Meta Runner season 3 after that 🥺 i need to fule my adicktion)
My current goal is survive for 20 more days.
Wait so this is on the glitch channel with the creator being a person who makes skit videos about a stupid mario in the gmod .....WOW
THIS IS GONNA BE SO COOL
but damn that soundtrack slaps
Ooo. Shiny!
Comment for promotion this perfect animation.
broke: cute robots kill each other woke: realistic way of humans 'accidentally' ending their race.
Hell yeah can't wait
When I saw the thumbnail, I was really upset that it's not Meta Runner Season 3. But now I see this trailer, i'm excited.
1:welp there goes the twist already in the trailer 2: very sceptical bout this one ngl
This is the terminator mixed with journey. I love it!
why did it look like an animation of CLIFF SIDE
the animation... and I thought meta runner looked amazing
Amazing i can feel the love,sweat and blood that went into this show You  are a skilled comedian and an even better animator  expect me to stick with your funny cartoons on smg4 and good animations on glich
God im so hyped about the OST its gonna be a masterpiece
Love it already
Yeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaayyyyyyyyy
Отличное видео
Given the robot designs I was sorta hoping this would be full on horror
oh. my. god........i. am. going. to. love. this. I hope there is some goofy worker robot that is haha funny, if there is he (or she) would be my favorite character.
Meta Runner Season 3 please
yes!
pogr
That looks sick
Okay so let me get this straight there are 2 types of robots: worker robot witch after some sort catastrophy started like living on their own, murder robot witch woke up someday and started killing worker robots because they were living on their own.
I didn't subscribe for this. I only wanted another MetaRunner season... :(   😭😭😭😭 dont just start new thingos, finish what you've started first
.OH, my god, this will be, epic, xd.  Pdf, for those, who wanted, Una La, (3) Third, Season of, Metta Runner, xd.
yoo, the looks of it are AWSOME. Really looking into this series.
Очень жду.
"Humans handled that by themselves" No we will die off before we even leave earth at this rate (Also AI sucks rn so even having ONE AI that functions anything like a sentient being is an accomplishment)
I love the concept of this web series. I'm so happy to see Glitch try new thing with a original character. You made such a good work everytime.   I have just one wish for her : please, make Subtitles in different languages (French, Spanish,...) for people who don't understand English.
I love this already
Wo, i freaking love it!!! is a pleasure that finally Liam had a studio where he could do his amazing art with no limits! Also i love how are made the murder drones! >-<
THATS TWO DAYS AFTER MY BIRTHDAY
Yuhuuuuuu
Nioce
Whoever disliked this video is so not the vibe
Oh my god! I cant wait too see this!
Wow
Why does serial designation N have the cutest voice darn these cute  murder drones for already melting our hearts
I fail to believe this is SMG4 right now   Holy shit this looks good.
👀
Well the big plot twist is probably gonna be that the yellow robot was bad all along, thanks for revealing that trailer
Holyy shittt thus looks like an actual show and the animation is just to Amazing omggggg and 29th October already gjaighkflvisnskcjsb
Nice
I like the look of it
This is the real future of our lives 🙁☹️😟😰😨😧😦😱😢😥😓😞
o yea
Im realy  excited for this new show, it realy  seems amazing
Wow, this is amazing!
Man i wish i was one of those robots, also i can’t believe this high quality show is being made by Kevin.
it looks really interesting, can't wait to see what it's about
Cant wait for the mario crossover lol
WOOOOW
“Robots you what that means, I can be as hardcore as I want and still be PG-13” - Melvin
I kind of wish this carried over from the other series a bit more.
ooo, Very Scary
Fr this looks like a Netflix series
This looks really good
Robots murder eachother? Hm.... where could I've seen this...
Yes
Yes I can my wait
WOOOHOOO
Glitch realised that in order to have the age rating not rise with more animated violence and guns they need to ditch humans and do it with something else instead. *Anime robots but in 1080p 60 fps*
:O
I like that murder drones in smg4 channels
I swear to god if thats fucking Michael Kovach, i am gonna lose it
It's fun to see a robot vs robot kind of plot
Omg is awesome
This one looks so interesting :O And the graphics are absolutely beautiful!
mmmmmmmmmmi dont like the animation style ITS WELL made dont get me wrong but idk seems cool tho
amazing OwO👍
Smg4 went from making low quality funny memes to this
Damn this actually looks really good... _Well I mean its glitch productions its always really good_
this looks G O O D...
I can already tell the ost for this is going to be good
It seems to me that even if Meta Runner Season 3 doesn't come out, I won't be disappointed. Awesome trailer! Now we can only wait...
Well this looks... interesting...
*You Would Try Your Best!*
Welp i can see the liam vicker style here....BUT EVERYTHERE  AND I LOVE IT
Holy jesus
I loved sunset paradise, to bad it ended. But now I can’t wait for this movie! It’s better than sunset paradise, but still inside my heart.
I expected Méta runner S3 but , WOW, this seems really good
My dad
It's way better for what it supposed to be a horror series. I think the horror part is because if its theme but without jumpscares. (which is a good thing because I don't usually like horror stuff due to jumpscares, which Murder Drones apparently will lack them) I'm officially sold!
MORE MONEY
yoooooooooo
Technically speaking these are not drones, since they aren't remotely controlled. But the Definition probably doesn't come from the Space Age so idk
the guy with the the yellow eyes that seems to be the male lead sounds like noi from aphmau’s MID
Wow, this must be on Netflix because it already look *GOOD* I bet this one is the best.   *It is epic already.* There is a company among us and friends...
Name one of the Murder Drones Miku or H.M For especially the pony tail murder drone
Why does this look way too insanely good
I knew this was going to be good but DAMN IS THIS GOOD
Идеально 😳
Nier Automata vibes regarding the plot and story writing. The murder boy boy gives me 9S vibes
This is gonna be awesome
meta runner season 3 when
That looks cool!!!
Aw heck yeah, I'm excited or this. I wonder if there's going to be cameos...
That music really reminds me of the *Portal Stories: Mel* Soundtrack. Hyped up for the series already!
Can we talk about the amazing music theme? Cause I love it I want it soo baaad
GLITCH: professional team making actual shows  smg4:            oooooooooo marios d*** feels fun SPAGHETTI, MEMES P*** MEMES MEMES MEMES MEMES MEMEMS OMGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG
Murder drones reminds me of hazbin hotel pilot 'cleanser angels', or whatever their name is! Love it!
holy fuck this looks awesome
That gonna be god danm good Also it funny 'cause in starbound the robot race are named glitch XD
I want to know what that murder drone is it looks so cool
Im down
Interesting…
I'm hyped baby
this looks really good, cant wait
MAKE.  CLIFFSIDE!
AYO LIAM VICKERS??
Do Sunset Paradise Season 2 w/ new characters
Can’t wait for the rule 34 Artist to mess up another good web series
O no , 3D
I’m sold
I’d like to see this in action and now already I wanna make a robot based off this show
Holy shit Liam Vickers
Wow This is some epic stuff
well. this trailer left a impact on me, and now I really want this show to not just have 1 season, I really wanna see 4 or 5 seasons of this. because this is Insane!! and I love it!!!
serial designation: "I really enjoyed our time together...i'm sorry..." mario: OH YOU ARE A TRAITOR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! *murder drones logo glitches*
the lighting looks so fucking good like you can literally chart the quality of these series visuals on a steep upward curve holy shit
I like sunset paradise more
High Quality yet again GLITCH
The animation looks crazy 😲 Cant wait for the pilot
Bro this animation is sick!
better then metarunner thats for sure but seriously you guys evolved from making simple mario videos using an emulator by literal netflix quality shows.good job,i hope for more big projects down the line soon,espicially that saiko show that was teased in WOTFI 2020
I wasn’t feeling to confident on murder drones but I’m like 99% sure imma watch this
HOLY SHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII
Let's hope we'll get a new waifu.
Why does this remind me of tohou? _Oh wait... sakuya exist_
So just think about it: SMG4/Glich produktions A YouTuber with 4-5 million subscribers, and he makes better shows than all the big companys with about 10.000.000 workers!!!!
Hype
Very, very excited for this! Glitch and Liam is a combo I never expected, but I'm very glad it happened. I wish the best for the series and the wonderful team behind it!
I hope eventually they make a movie
Does anyone feel the Madness Combat Vibe from all of this? Because I’m feeling it…
;)
I’m sorry Glitch, but the “quickly became homophobic” meme has ruined the logo for me
omg
Can we for once have a show with a male protagonist this is like the 4rth time
wooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooowwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
I wanted Meta Runner Season 3, but this we will do.
why does serial degsination N sound like Noi's sound from Aphmau's channel (just a thought it could be someone else tho)
Wait a minute  robots don’t have feelings
ÔwÔ
i like how the scientists just shrugged as their planet blew up
So when’s the main character of this series getting into smg4?
Wait a minute I think penny snap cube is VA in this show! That is actually hype if true
III NEEEE IIIT
Can’t wait to build a connection with a side character so they can get offed 3 episodes later
Don't make weird art of the robots. I'm begging you
Slaves
0:20 Humanity's greatest skill: Self destruction.
Glitch is popping off with another banger
*corpses everywhere :)*
Ok, ok but when meta runner
This Is literly judgement day
*Y'all ready to get attached to these characters who are going to die ?*
If they ever made a super op cat robot just the shape of a cat but literally can summon nuke out of thin air just to spite this series in later episode im loving this even more
Holy shit is cybertruck 2077
I’m sad 😭
I NEED IT And MR3
YAY I LOVE MURDER
Holy shit I’m so excited for this
i hope it will be good when the 1st ep comes out right SMG4?
spookober is gonna get spooky
this feels like hazzbin hotel extermination day
*mindustry in a nutshell*
This has to be the best one yet there's no way it's not
Smg4 you corny memer I'm in
:0
Am I the only one who thinks that the killer robots look kind of like those exterminator angels from Hazbin with their wings out?
I'm so fuckin' excited this looks absolutely PHENOMENAL. I just hope it stays seperate from anything related to SMG4, like Tari being Meta Runner's protagonist or Meggy being the protagonist of Sunset Paradise. Y'know what I mean?
This trailer looks better than any other movie ive watched in my entire fucking life.
I am still sad about cliffside
Kinda would have preferred the drawn cartoon style but hey it still looks awesome and considering it is coming from you guys no way in hell it will be bad, i am willing to try new things
Liam woohoo 🎉
That graphic seems impossible for my potato phone
Looks so good
My god I have to wach this when it comes out
give me more
A n o t h e r O n e
20 DAYS TO GO BOYS
This show is just wow really awsome
Holy...
That's right, kids, if senseless, never-ending and constant murder is on something that doesn't bleed, it's okay!
THIS IS GONNA BE FUCKING BALLIN
Oh shit Oh shitOh shitOh shitOh shitOh shitOh shitOh shitOh shitOh shitOh shitOh shitOh shitOh shitOh shitOh shitOh shitOh shitOh shitOh shitOh shitOh shitOh shitOh shitOh shitOh shitOh shitOh shitOh shitOh shitOh shitOh shit
humanity did a big oopsie to the earth 🙂
i thought this was a really bad trailer for a video game, turns out it was a really good trailer for a show, ill probably watch it!
YES!  YES!  YES!
Honestly I like the head design. Of the robots the face looks like a sonic face and eye style
Finally something that doesn't have anything with SMG4
Holy crap that was awesome I can't wait for the pilot to drop as a huge fan of meta runner I cannot wait for the series to start see you on oct 29
AMAZING I CANT WAIT
Is this the Saiko show?
No entendí nada por qué nunca hay subtitulos :c
This would be a sick game
I'm getting a 2B-9S vibes here. Just that 2B is a psychopaths and 9S is more of a cinnamon roll
Idk what it is but I love the mouths
Looks awesome!
BRB firing up the popcorn dispenser for the premiere date 🍿
This makes me so happy and just can’t wait!!!
Violence...... only this
HELL YES THIS LOOKS FABULOUS
HOLY CRAP I WANT THIS NOW
I fink i will Like that one
Can't wait for it to come man!👍
Glitch is a animation channel that is supported by Epic Games and could be the best gaming animation in the life time and should be hired by Ginx Tv
Very excited!
Cringe
if mario was in… murder drones. (you already did that with meta runner so…)
Why the heck is the murder drone's design look so awesome, calm down Liam.
I'm so exited for the cooperation (:
Keep in mind, this is the man who makes shitposts about Mario every Saturday.
What about Meta RUNNER Season 3 ?
No clue what this is but its funky and i like it.
Who recognize Evelyn's voice ?
Idk why but something about this just feels familiar somehow
I feel like from the show and this it’s like armored core huge lore Gap every interesting
i wonder what happend to ultra juma mania
This looks... So amazing! I am so excited, just... I miss Meta runner... I remember enjoying every episode of it, every time a new one was released... But all I want is... Meta runners season 3... If possible.
YESSS NEW SHOW TO START WATCHING SOON
Y O . THIS FEELS LIKE A FRIKIN NETFLIX SERIES!!
Wow cant wait for this!!! the trailer is cool!!!
Wow cant wait for this!!! the trailer is cool!!!
we're gonna get 3 more series until meta runner season 3 comes out lol
I’ve been waiting for this
That sounds interesting but they don't look that scary the last one was cool and it was and I'm not talking like Maggie's Paradise I'm talking like male runner that one was very cool cuz you had like people of arms and weird robot stuff this one's this robot City kill humans I don't seem that much worthy of watching also watch your main channel though
Looks nice.
Smg4 is going to be on Netflix one day!        I’m calling it rn…
Can't wait for the eventual game looks like its gonna be like Metro. I fucking Loved Metro.
Amazing.
YOOOOOOOOO
Its Detroit become human but with portal and half life lore
I've seen those characters before, I just don't remember where
holy shit, this actually looks like a good Glitch Productions show                       I'm kidding obviously, I haven't seen the previous 2 shows they made and I refuse to watch it ever so stfu, but this one hooked me on board
Wait.. does that mean I’m a drone to I’m starting to know to much
That looks so cool, and the music is amazing. It sounds both chilling and dramatic at the same time. 10/10 I am excited to see this.
The scientists when they messed up: guess I’ll die
If this won't be family friendly im sure im gonna love it❤️
THE ANIMATION IS SO GOOD T-T God the detail and the effects I can't i'm so excited T-T
oh boy cant wait for what the rule34 artist will do
My men Liam was in GLITCH all this time. And this series is like the sequel of Internecion Cube.
Wow this will sure be interesting
1:08 Grunkle Ford, is that you?
That was bloody EPIC!!! I CAN'T WAIT FOR THIS TO COME OUT!!!!💕💕💕
Cool
No this is my kind of content
In the 22nd century, this will be known as "Terminator: The Netflix Adaptation".
I'm so excited for this I saw a leak last year and cant wait for it
IS A SPOOOKY MONTH 2021
Edgy
Liam told me to come here, so I did, and I've subbed.
so epic
Has robots.  Has Violence.  I watch.
I'm an so unbelievably excited that this pilot might come out before I've even completed Metroid dread (which funnily enough is also about murder robots)
Nee characters in SMG4 New smg:  Sonic the SMG5
is this a movie or is it an eps?
this looks like a good show but is it tv 14 like meta runner or ma
By the beginning I know it’s going to to be mind blowing
ohhhh
How did I start with watching questionable vines and end with watching this masterpiece?
This is going to be good
Si hay al menos un humano vivo en la serie por unos minutos estaría chido
liam vickers: ima start a new series! internecion cube: oh no, im gonna get forgotten cliffside, lets split up, the entire SSTWL series: first time?
My disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined. I wanna die.
A war of machines vs machines, now thats rare
Tf2 spy mains
Hype!!!! I’m fan meta runner and sunset paradise
pilot's coming sooner than I thought. Kind of surprised it seems like there are no human characters at all.
this looks like a freaking movie, just amazing. Good luck with the series!
Wow loving this animation loving this even what you did to Sunset paradise
im literally hyped for this to release but this comment has no emotion
This is really well animated for a trailer
I REMEMBER THIS GUY
O.M.G. the collaboration of Glitch studio and Liam animation... FINALY I SEE A FULL SEASON OF LIAM'S PILOTS !!! he earn it, thanks glitch!

This is the third coming of madness combat
.........................AND THE HYPE IS REAL!!!!!!
Let's murder some drones
amazing
"I'm Serial Designation N!" Are the other two named 'S' and 'I' ?
What they are controlled by another entity called the
*" mostly because they handled that just fine by themselves "*
damm this is good a fooking master piece all I can say is noice can you please do us all a favour and "accidently" release this show on the 10th of October sorry if I sound rude or disrespectful as I have no idea how hard it is to make a animated show of that quality and I am very exited for this masterpiece  to be available on YouTube.
not 3D pleace
I think I will love this
Yes murder :D
This looks awesome can’t wait to see the pilot
These dudes look like the spooder from cliffside
Yes yes yes yes Ive been waiting for this
"But Vwe don't need to faight!"
20 days remaining
Ну не знаю, эммм, хоть у меня и есть враждённая ненависть к 3d, это не выжигает мне глаза.
Hmmmm I want to say I would give this a 6/10 because it is good like the graphics and drama but could have done just a little bit better but it is a lot better then taris and a tiny bit better then meggys show so yeah.
i feel like N is gonna be a loveable character that a lot of people are gonna draw with him being a cute dude i hope nothing bad happens to him he already is my favorite
That was EPIC!! I swear the drone with the pigtails at 1:16 looks like…    Saiko?? Why do these trailers remind me of her so much?
Nice
Sheereerrrreressssss
Niiiiiicccceeeee
OK! OK!! I AM L O V I N G THIS
Pretty hyped for this actually
I love the grim darkness and robot gore of this new show it makes me smile yes I love gore and violence in shows
Awesome trailer!!! I can't wait to watch the pilot episode of Murder Drones!!! That's so YEET!!!!
Their first show that wasn't part of SMG4 in some way when it started. This will be interesting
Let’s Gooooooooo!!!!!
Yesssss
*BEAUTIFUL* absolutely *BEAUTIFUL*
I hope the Bot Liam voices is named John Matthews
Terminaters Vs highly dangerous Keter class Terminaters
say wha
HOLY #### I CAN'T WAIT
I can say with absolute certainty that this is going to be an absolute banger
0:21 Welp we just destroyed earth and doomed the human race, woopsy
yooo, this is gonna be epic
The guy playing the nice murder drone is noi from aphmau I recognize the voice And this is looks exactly like the dumb club penguin movie episode things
YEEEEEEEES
I'm hearing Subverse character voices
Can it bree- I mean blend though
This is the coolest thing I've ever seen
I think this is gonna be epic it seems like it will be more of a spooky show but with action and comedy mixed in a little and i cant wait to watch it
O M G
I remember seeing an animatic of this and now its animated
Honestly it's Awesome!!!!! 😳☠
Fucking hell this is great
I’m so happy Liam is starting to get more recognized love his works
I’m intrigued! But whatever happened to Ultra Jump Mania?
POG
"Warning: Planet Core Collapse" 'Vibe = Harshed' Ya you bet your ass imma watch this when it comes out lmao
Damn that looks nice. We all thought meta runner s2 looked nice but DAMN.
* whispers * i like robots
This looks sickkk, reminds me alot of madness combat, i am so hyped
This already looks like a movie
Didn’t like the Sunset Paradise series too much because to me it felt like the targeted audience of the overall series was for kids, this actually seems interesting. Keep up the work.
Awesome idea its like Nier_Automata but from the robots perspective
ok this is actually looking cool LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS RELEASE!
OH MY GOD!!! OK IT'S HAPPENING, STAY CALM!!
Cant wait with some high efforts on this new series!
This is gonna be great!!!
Epic.
Ummmm okay......looks awesome........definitely the kind of content we expect from this.....you've got this in the bag.
I can’t wait to watch it
Okay I’m calling it before it happens, this is the same universe as the meta runner.
the lighting is sick 👌
That feeling when someone accidentally blows the planet out of orbit and freezes any living thing  It’s very cold
Glitch community should do a game like this!
this is looking amazing can't wait
1, 2, 3 why is the earth gone now
I love the story I can only imagine how good it is with liam Vicker behind it
That music is bussin
Yes just yes
How in the world did they get to this point in making this amazing thing
Damn this is epic quality
This is like Cybertron
LET'S FUCKING GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Idk but that look like an ps5 game
Glitch and smg4 can easily just beat Disney and dream works and Pixar
shrapnel x madness combat anyone?
This looks amazing
I’ve watched this so many times b/c I’m so fricking hyped for this!
Looks... Interesting
https://youtu.be/4KEVMh7t8Jc
Ooh deadly genocide and venomous I dig it
Imagine after they are done whit the series they just make a Game about it
1:09
This is streaming service quality shit  It should be on one because this is too good!
Oh boy Darwin let watch
Yoooooooooooo this looks sick as hell
ok all I could see were robots and future waifus
Wow 2021 has been good so far, but im just waiting to get slapped in the fa- * sees this trailer * *LETS A F*CKING GOOOOOOOOOOOO*
Different from the source material but okay

Interesting... I look forward to watching this.

This trailer left me salivating for more Murder Drones content. I AM SO HYPED!!!
....so Madness Combat, Terminator, and a dash of Wall-E. I’m sold.
i didnt know lima vickers teamed up with glitch! this look so rad!
Is this going to be like the next RVB!!!???
Beach episode when
Now we need Meta Runner SEASON 3 CUZ MY ENTIRE LIFE WAITED FOR META RUNNER SEASON 3
Smg4 is getting better at animating
Dude smg4 you realy have the world sold on this one I wish I could be like you
NO WAY, I SAW THIS AS A SKETCH ANIMATION A WHILE AGO… and now it’s being picked up by glitch. I think it was called inter something cube.
Why does this sound like a good gacha game craze if turned into a game lol
THIS IS GONNA BE LIT
Vvvv this is actually good.
Then the finale shows it’s a new show in the smgverse
0:20 *Nah thats probably nothing*
The voice acting and animations are so high quality
YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
but mom i dont wanna wait until october 29th!
si
Orange hat guy is best charicter
Can't wait for this 🤗
How many of us would be way more exited for this even if super Mario odyssey 2 was announced right now?
RIPPED trailers
Cant wait to wacth
0:22 sounds about right, Ms. narrator
The music is giving me a lot of Portal 2 vibes, is anyone else getting that?
Wow, this is really cool, and they are also robots, which means you can show violent scenes with them and not be afraid of the age limit.
I THOUGHT I RECOGNIZE THAT ART STYLE!
man this is sick, cant wait for the pilot
This looks insane, and I am so hyped for that
Ayo Netflix where u at
I leave youtube for a month and I come back to a complete fuckin masterpiece. I love YouTube.
HOLY SHIT!!! THIS LOOKS EPIC
Excitement.
Wow, talk about dark. 😐  I love it already! 😁
This soundtrack is going to be awesome.
cool trailer can the protagonist in this series be in the smg4 cast (I mean we have Tari, meggy, and this robot now btw)
You Can Already Tell That This Is Gonna Be *EXCITING, INTENSE* And *EPIC*
I haven’t seen a SINGLE comment mentioning Michael Kovach!!
When I watched this I didn’t get a vibe but hopefully I will be pleased when the pilot comes out. Keep up the good work 👍
Who’s the main voice actress? She sounds super familiar but I can’t put my finger on it.
Starting with mario. Doing better with mario films or stuff. Even better with a cross platform gamer girl. And now this? Damn...You guys really are getting good at it! Just imagine your films on netflix!
Wow, otro proyecto protagonizado por una mona china, que inesperado SMG4
Yay, a new series to have a self insert fan fiction so I have something to do in my free time
i watched this after i watched a car explode on youtube
So this was another project they’ve been working on I guess so since I’m pretty sure they’re trying to get money for Meta Runner Season 3 and there still needed of funding for the money
That looks really awesome! Can’t wait to see it release. I think I’m in Heaven to be honest though, because it’s a dream come true to see Liam Vickers do work on an animated series. I loved Cliffside
WOAH THIS LOOKS AMAZING
yoooo this got such a different feeling to it. i love it already
These series literally come out on my birthday
This looks amazing, I'm excited
I KNEW THAT NAME LOOK FAMILIAR
Looks spooky
OH MY GOSH!!! 😲😲😲
Its so touching in someway. Gives 2006~ cartoons vibes
Humans was like i guess I'll die
DUUUUUDE THE SNIMATION FOR EACH SHOW HAS GOTTEN PROGRESSIVELY BETTER AND BETTER! THIS LOOKS AMAZING!!! I CANT WAIT FOR THE PILOT
Was that PM Seymour I heard voicing a character, or am I going insane?
This is epic!🔥
Hold up this is fire
I thought the thumbnail's style looked familiar. It's good one of Liam Vicker's shows is gonna get the attention they deserve
This looks like something you would see in a preview in a movie theater, the quality is literally movie quality. This is amazing, keep it up SMG4 team.
This looks so good I’m very excited to see it
Can't wait for this to go live I can't wait
ACTIVE: Jax enters *Evasion*, a defensive stance, for 2 seconds, causing all non-turret basic attacks against him to be dodged. Jax also takes 25% reduced damage from all champion area of effect abilities. *Counter Strike* can be recast after 1 second.  At the end of the duration, Jax stuns all nearby enemies for 1 second and deals physical damage to them, increased by 20% for each attack dodged, up to a 100% increase.
Holy cow this trailer made me fucking *breathe*
Damn. This is, like, the darkest themed show Glitch is making. I mean the idea is that Humanity pretty much kills itself and leaves destruction robots to keep the ones they made as slaves from becoming more than slaves. And, again, this is being made by the guys that made shows about cyborg gaming tournaments and Super Meggy Sunshine! This looks absolutely insane and amazing!
I'm just hype for a liam vickers series to actually conclude instead of ending midway
Ngl this is gonna be popular
Mega Runner Season 3? Still waiting for that cliffhanger to end.
Ok, lets just hope that if a robot die we can still build a new body and put their data into that robot
Those drones: *I got murder on my mind*
Im so glad robo-cop wasn't a thing I was into. Bc that would ruin this show for me
Now we just wait till they make the main character meet mario in the smg4 channel somehow and become a homie
Нифига себе, да это шедевр просто, можете переводить это, мне лень с переводом писать
Cwol
Ah shit, here we go again
I wonder if they are ever gonna continue meta runner or turn sunset paradise into a series because I would realy enjoy that
OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Ok I know this will be good and all but I was kind of hoping a new series staring melony to be announce but I guess instead we got this
Dude I love this but  WHEN IS META RUNNER SEASON 3 RELEASING?!!
Дважды Влад уж оо
P Ờ G
Man, I thought they were gonna make a show on melony, guess I was wrong. But this is better
Damn that’s pretty good
what i know from the trailer is : wing robot with huge ass claws fight no wing robot with guns?
When the first episode comes out The next day Me: time to check to green websites again
This looks so good on him excited
Cool
The best animation i have seen in the GLITCH channel
Im gonna love this
Humans in the reactor be like:Guess I'll die
I knew Vickers was involved as soon as I saw the evil grin
this is a Glitch thing I actually want to watch
I love the trailer! It looks great, I just want to critique the animation. I believe it should be smoother, but I assume you already know this. I can't wait until it comes out.
This is one of the first trailers that really caught my attention and now im just dying to watch it.
Oh i cant wait for murder drones to come out
Omg!
This is gonna be awesome to watch i can tell, i so wanna draw my own drone oc new due to how cool this looks, thanks guys for the inspiration
MICHAEL KOVACH AND ELSIE LOVELOCK ARE IN THIS???? already my favorite show i have nothing more to say
"just beacause they handeled that fine all by themselves"  the Earth: are you sure about that?
HELL YEAH! I LOVE IT SO FAR! EVERYTHING IS JUST AMAZING!
I love this already
Best graphics I ever seen RTX in on!
Shit, now I really want to draw an OC Drone.
When will come out?
Finally a new movie
Watch it not be this great and be a above picture view game. Just like Hotline Miami
WHAT ABOUT META RUNNER SEASON 3 THOOOOO?
The people that just disliked the video they made me mad
I'm down lets go
I AM DYING SEE THAT!!!!!!!
It looks great
its funny how people where expecting meta runner season 3 when this show is way better.
IS THAT MICHAEL FUCKING KOVACH IM SCREAMING
Hmmm this is aaa sucks 😔 my opinion , Sr pelo : ( monster ) aaaaaaaaa 😡 . Me : aaaaaaaah 😵
Looking good as always
Is one of the actors play in The Sonic the hedgehog movie
Where I-con???
I genuinely didn't even notice which youtube subscription I got this video from, thought it was the creator.
Oooh this is going to be awesome! Another animated series from Glitch!
hooo my god i love it
Hey GLITCH PRODUCTION will you have subtitles in Spanish like in SUNSET PARADISE ??
Robots and violence?  Sign me up!
Well, now… this should be interesting
Believe the hype
NOICE
Dude I can't wait
Another show and with violence and in spooky month my prayers were answered
Who is the voice actor for the robot girl that we see in the first part is it the voice actor of Tari
This looks absolutely phenomenal, from the visuals to the sounds and music, but my favorite part has to be those wings. I absolutely love robotic wings like that. They just look really cool to me.
THIS LOOKS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD
Add me on this video( Voice Actors only) 🥺🥺
Meanwhile Meta Runner:💀
for some reason i remembered detroit become human
OMG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Coold
My bday is in oct 27
October 29th is my birthday! What a great present!
Portal vibes for some reason
0:46 “sO nOt ThE ViBe”
I want a shrek reference
But they are robots there is no blood or strips banana/10
One of the only glitch that I will no matter what research every single crevice of lore that is available
Little nightmares but robots change my mind
I'm about tho see this series 100 timed( looks really cool seriously i am excited to see it)
Mr SMG4 make the meta runner arc : What is  tari past  Mario and  friends going to silica city
alredy a fan of the sirie
I feel like I’ve seen all of the plots revolving around autonomous murder androids at this point, and this is one of the best ones
Gacha life kids be like:  imma remake this but the title is (I feel in love with my killer fell 😻)
This looks incredible!
This seriously looks so good! Just all the animation, the story looks like it will be interesting, the world is cool, and the characters already seem amazing.
I hope this last for ever!
in guessing this is a really good show and not a game
Hype
Murder drones, this show it's about robots. It's reminds me of Megaman, Robotboy, and Meta runner.  This cames out on October 29th after Sora is download on 18th in ssbu.
hey @glitch I know that you and your team is working on it but could you upload the pilot Episode on the 27th 10 because my dad is going to be somewhere else(it's called 'reha' and it's a german word like hospital but it's school' and then i am somewhere else too so i want it to see before i go. thanks see ya!
Now that we know betrayal is a part of this i am sad
getting ready for rule 34
so that wasnt IC-ION in the original teaser. hmmmmmmm? theory time theory time
Instead of blood there will be oil and more oil and circuit boards flying everywhere
Oh woah the guy who made the cliffside pilot is making a new show with Glitch? I loved Cliffside so I can’t wait to see what they have in store
OMG!! the pilot for it is on MY birthday!! WOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!
Wasn’t the original title of this series Amazon vs. eBay?
This looks great I will keep an eye on it and watch the pilot October 29.
I AM GONNA NEED THIS OST
Wow!
The description is giving me a lot of Madness Combat vibes, but the video tells a whole different story.  Can't wait for the show to begin :D
Well, this is just Nier: Automata again, but I hope without the soul-crushing.
the music is incredible !
I can't wait for this! as much as I loved meta runner and sunset this show looks WAY better (not to put down sunset and meta of course, still love them)
This loooks so fucking interesting
Can't wait
0:46 I legit rewinded this 6 times just cause it was funny omfg
Oooh boy
This reminds me of a transformers show
This looks like it was made by a different studio. And I mean that in the best compliment I can muster! This looks pretty damn good!
AAAAHHHHHHH HYPE HPYE HYPE HYPE HYPE THIS SHOW LOOKS SO AMAZING I CAN'T WAIT!!!!!!
This marks the beginning to the first glitch productions show that is not directly connected or a spin-off of the smg4 series
Finally a liam vickers show
Cool trailer but the world is ice
This looks absolutely amazing
OooooOoo, Now this is the show im looking for!
Drones? Blood? There’s blood? Personalities that only humans have? This logic is the best thing ever :,)
Bro this looks like a frikin movie awesome can’t wait
Makes you think on how two guys ho make videos on mario being dumb can make full on seasons of shows with good story's

Welp I can already tell I'll miss most of the premiere and then watch them with the comments going with the spoilers...Still,this is gonna be fun to watch
Ya know i honestly thought melony would get her own show. But wow I was wrong. On the plus side I was right about smg4 having other plans for glitch production.
Just in time for Halloween! I’m loving what I’m seeing here!

I'm calling it now: "SMG4: If Mario was in... Murder Drones"
Cool

This is so awesome
LESS GOOOO GOOD JOB LIAM AND GLITCH
I've been watching Liam Vickers for quite a while now. I'm so glad that he's getting this opportunity!
Cool
this could be a good show on netflix
A glitch series that won’t star a member of the SMG4 crew, looking forward to meeting new characters! ^^
Holy
Hmm
Oh I'm _so_ watching this
This looks absolutely amazing! I finally have something to wait for!
0:55 Hold the phone. Micheal?! What’re u doing here?! 😯
I can hear some meta runner sound here
Hope liam doesnt abandoned this project like the others
AYO OCTOBER 29 IS MY BIRTHDAY YALL!!!! Btw, all i know is that it's gonna be a very intresting episode.
Holy crap.
And then I remembered I’m already subscribed so yay!
damn, they weren't kidding when they said that these robots are cute.      **slowly pulls out mason jar**
This looks cool
This is gonna be LIT!! 🔥
Why are the robots so murderous
0:19 VIBE = HARSHED
Cant wait
Can't wait!
I absolutely would love to see the finishing work of this, it looks great already, I still have questions but those will be answered when the show is finished of course, I still can't wait
*War protocols initiated.*
HOLY SHIT I just realized that it was the Liam who made cliffside I watched this add twice and I felt like I had heard similar voice acting but I couldn't put it anywhere
Cool Cant Wait :D
Oh boy, here I go killing again!
I LOVE IT
eh this doesnt look for me
That trailer is...SO AWESOME!!!!I like how they  made the sound and robots look awesome.I am so gonna watch this when it come out..
They managed to bring Liam's style from 2d to 3d so well, it frankly terrifies me.
Next smg4 character ?
1:11 the killer bot look so cute
looks like I'm gonna have to make reaction videos :)
this looks great and worth the wait
Do I hear oil
holy shit balls, what is this
I couldn’t decide w  he at to comment so I’ll just comment all of the    1. Hype, hype, hype, hype…  2. Shut and take all my money!  3. I wonder how long it will take r34 to get there hands on this project…  4. hype, hype, hype, hype!!!
Their animation is getting better and better!!
I bet in the future she will be the new smg4 character.
10/10 because it drops on my birthday. Oh and also it looks good and stuff.
Can there be an episode where the human race survived?
looks different from meta runner
HOW ARE YOU NOT ON NETFLIX YET
I can tell you've had this in development for who knows how long, easily the best animation thus far!
the animation its incredible, the creator of clifside and smg4 in glitch studios work togheter is fantastic  P.D. subtitles in spanish for your fans latinoamericans please
AHH IM SO HYPED! Such a big fan of Sunset Paradise and Meta Runner, so can’t wait for a new series to drop.
Wow
Eh, the original was like 12k times better... But I'm still gonna watch it
Just the thumbnail got me interested. I love me some Liam Vickers Animation
I like the concept of the human race wiping themselves out rather than robots going on a killing spree.
IM SO EXITED
i dont know why but this makes me cringe                       FINISH META RUNNER WE NEED MORE THAN TWO SEASONS ITS LIKE GRAVITY FALL'S BUT X2. TOO MUCH LORE TO MUCH WORRY AND TOO LONG TO AWNSER THE LORE GAAAAGH
Wow omg im supper wow wow happy
This unironically looks lot better than sunset paradise. I get that Meggy was important to the channel but now the team gets to do something original
I like it please be a series I need something to fill the hole that sunset paradise left
THIS LOOKS LIKE A SERIES I WOULD WATCH
Holy shit I’m excited
I want the Song of the series
cant wait
Season 3 of meta runner when.
So one of the robots is joining SMG4's crew... cool
Wow
is it weird why all of glitches series main characters are women
This looks amazing!
Me: NICE
In The City, The Auditor Has Been Awakened In A City Of Drones, And He Tries To Make A Murder Drone.
YO THIS LOOKS FIRE 🔥
Wow, that looks awesome!!!
can not god damn wait, also yellow face at 0:56 giving me strong 9S vibes
Let’s see here… Obvious plot twist of an evil villain, and a useless protagonist. *MAKE THIS BABY PG AND THIS WOULD BE A GOD DANG DISNEY MOVIE!* Just kidding it probably goes HARD like the main character dies and the story has to have another protagonist *hard*
Where's tari?
Holy SHIt this is amazing, can't wait
This will be AWESOME
This reminds me of the damn extermination from Hazbin Hotel. And I love that show so much, so I can already tell I’m gonna love this
cant wait for anticipating each episode like its meta runner
YES, I NEED IT
Damn I was truly hoping for the same idea as other vid of human and murder drone teaming up. This looks good too but it definitely has bigger potential for bad story.
Interesting.
BRO THIS LOOKS SICK!!! AMAZING!!! ❤️🧡💛💚💙💜💖🤎🖤🤍
Who watches this over and over again
Me: this is gonna be awesome! The little part of my subconscious: Im seeing a patern (all series about a girl in problems)
Oh snap looks absolutely epic!
*this planet suffered a critical core collapse* It seemed they dug too far and lowered the pressure inside the planet
oh my god this is so high effort
Fucking Cool.
Epic anime
Wow
Now this is more like it!!!
Oh its going to be great
Dam that’s cool.
Ooooooo this looks fun
BRO I CANT WAIT FOR THE FIRST EPISODE
YOOOOOOO HYPE
wow cant wait for that
God I really want this to have more than 10 episodes this is one interesting series!
Yo I'm loving this.
BOOSTED ANIMATION LET’S GO! WHAT IS THAT SICK ANIMATION!
I wanted a BRAND NEW Mario series, but... this still good! :)
THIS GOTTA RELEASE ON  NETFLIX BOIIIII
A yo I thought it was a prank but dang it’s REAL.
after at least two years finding his channel, this is unexpected
Oh boy
SO EPIC
Hey think I've seen this before
I don't understand a thing wtf is going on?????
Front page news! Spider-Man kills all of humanity and cool drones take its place!
I think i heard noi
SHOUT-OUT TO ALL THE LIAM VICKERS FANS!!
Aplausos
Do you guys mind if I make my own OC for this?
Dope.
HMMMMMM
Glitch: Makes a new animated series Me: still waiting for season 3 of meta runner
I think i know who is main karakter
Damn, the antagonist looks hot-
Mad respect to GLITCH, one of the best web-series creators around
This looks amazing and it seens like this project will have a good future. I love the graphics, character designs and such, so good work so far.
it's gay
DUDE THIS LOOKS COOL
This looks awesome! I can’t wait for the pilot and the rest, this really is the biggest project!!
Does this take place in a parallel universe or 1500 years after SMG4 and meta runner?.
you know when i sup to this channel, not ones i watch sunset paradise or meta runner is not my cup of tea but a Murder Drones! hell ya i well watch it
This is going to be the greatest thing of 2022...huhuhu
Nice
this looks dope
This looks sick asf
meggy voice acting a caracter?
This feels like you are going to get away with a lot of things just because they are robots... Anyways, when you are going to release the soundtrack?
Looks pretty awesome, need to keep eyes out for this one. Glad to see Liam having outlets for his madness!
…this is an avengers level threat  this can literally be a movie trailer
ITZ TIME TA START DA WAAAAAGH
Oh THIS IS HYPED
amazing :D
:D
Ahhh Androids, the solution AND cause to all of life's problems!
Those murder drones look just like YoRHa androids….
Watch it I must
LOVE
oh dang, i will admit this is quite awesome!!! 😁 especially as a sci-fi fan i really love this. 👍
Probably just my phone but did this lag for anyone else?
OMG YES <3
who's excited for this 👇
God two months feel like forever
Can’t wait
Is it me or does the voice saying "You led a murder drone here?!" sound like Stanford Pines from Gravity Falls
Is it just me that thinks this have some nier automata inspirantions?
I smell another animated masterpiece going on!
Well the title is very direct
The voice acting is phenomenal
Does this mean that they won't be making anymore sunset paradise or meta runner seasons?
scary
YEEEEEEEE
hell yeah this is exciting.
That looks epic
WOW THAT QUALITY 👌
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH I was waiting for something like this for years
Def has that Halloween vibe, cant wait for the pilot!
Can't wait for the ost to release
WOOOOWWWW ANOTHER SERIESSSSSSS
I'm actually interested to see how this show plays out from looking at this trailer, it's going to be great. However Luke and Kevin still haven't explained or talked about that blurred pink show on there time line (for does who don't know, look at the glitch production shows time line).
LETS GO NEW SHOW
WOOOOOOHOOOO
Will the main character end up reprogrammed,redesigned to be a murder drone cuz it kinda make sense they have a useless member well switch it to a more officiant robot she will improve to be a much better protector somehow and they will use the useless drones body parts cuz it is still a drone body and getting new pieces would be risky or the drones can use this to make her submit to them easier
when the killer robots enter kill mode it kinda reminds me of somthing but idk what tho  ok now i remember its cliffside
Imagine if Luke or James was involved in voice acting any main characters or cameos  Also i'm excited for the show!
Tbh i thought this would be an actually movie
Tbh i thought this would be an actually movie
Hate to be that guy but GLITCH don’t have the main protagonist be female challenge: Instant fail  But in all seriousness this looks really good and cool.
YO YO YO AHHHH
MY GOSH AM I EXCITED FOR THIS!!!
Glitch is getting better and better with their animating abilities.
It looks as if the main mascot of murder drones is also main antagonist
This looks cool.
Smg4: announced a new show  Meta runner fans: where new episode
I wonder if they will run into greg on exoplanets
Where is meta runner?????
Is uhhhhh megaman in this?
DAMNNNN BROOO THIS IS ABOUT TO BE AS COOL AS META RUNNER
This has the vibes of an anime
This is like The Mitchells VS. The Machines except Machines are killing Machines.
This looks awesome
poggers or should i say..~~~ SLAUGHTER!   [poggers but in murder language.]
I can’t wait for the rule 34
Liam Vickers god damn it you’ve actually done man I’m so proud of you
i am not the person to like pg-13 things but i think i might watch this anyway
The art style in this looks so good.
this is absolutely insane
I am so confused but at the same time I am excited
THIS LOOKS AS GOOD AS META RUNNER AND SUNSET PARADISE MAYBE EVEN BETTER!!!!!!!!
Cast list, please?
There is a chanel with similar characters, but I can't remember the name. Is it a Collab?
the end of the trailer he whoever he says ``im sorry i really enjoined our time together`` hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
Oh boi, I recognise this art style everywhere, can't watch trailer now but I hope its about Icon
Bruh this is so high quality I’m surprised I didn’t see “only in theaters” at the end 😂
Planet exploding nearly made me bust a nut. It looked mind blowingly awesome.
YESS FINALLY A ROBOT SERIES
Woah 🤯
Isn't the murder drones similar to the robots from Internecion Cube
THEY GROW UP SO FAST 😭, and this is why SMG4 is my favorite animation channel.
Let's goooooooooo!! So hyped for this, it's great to see Liam's work with the support of a lot of people, thank you glitch for this opportunity and thank you Liam for this amazing series
This looks like a bad post-apocalyptic ending to Meta Runner...    And I love it!
I am so hype : D
Now here is a good question, if humanity went extinct, who exactly built the murder drones, who are they referring to as their parents?
that's going to mean for season 3 Of Meta Runner!
OK, considering this is a series about robots killing Eachother, there's 1 thing to keep in mind:  Do not get attached to the characters
Finally, my man Liam got himself a full series. I was dying for cliffside, more let's split up, but lo and behold, glitch delivers. I give you my thanks.
this looks awesome can't wait
Lo necesito, subtitulado al español  :(
Yooooo can’t wait
This looks legendary
Love it
I have an smg4 fan  for the past year and this is better than any thing
Yes
...Okay then. o_o
cool i like it but i prefurr "they look cats to me" SUNSET PARADISE and most of we "i think" want SUNSET PARADISE 2
Imagine if there is a SMG4 video where a murder drone befriends a character, maybe Mario, and joins the group in place of Axol (Rip Axol).  Or a video called "If Mario was in Murder Drones" sounds good too. Either way this series looks awesome and Im looking forward to it. Also why is no one talking about the amazing music?
the first non smg4 related content, huh... I WANT IT SO BAD
20 days
this is the future of anime
This is epic
I totally Don’t have a since of humor
Can’t wait
Hello  I wanted to know, if someday there will be dubbing, for other languages, why I wanted to watch it, but I don't know English very well.   and I don't care if it's fan dubbing, because sometimes there are channels that do amazing fan dubbing, so it would be nice in the future to have some dubbing or fan dubbing in the animations.
Ooo
Looks good, you better not fuck this up like the other series
Man this good Rule: muhahahaha
I would honestly like this show as a video game it looks like it’s meant to be a game.
Nice
OH WOW
Hhhmm,Disney movie
idk why but this gives me some helluva boss vibes. lol
HOLY CRAP I love the vibe this gives off, can't wait for the debut!
OH HELL YEAH IM GONNA WATCH THIS
nice
Well Luke wasn't lying when we said it was going to have a lot of gorr not disappointed just excited
This is a really, really fun premise. The voice acting could use some work, but I'm still really excited for this.
So no meta runner season 3
Whoa-ho-ho! That style is fiyaaaaa!!!
october 29th.  now this is something to look foward to
the first two main characters were from the actual smg4 show so what will it be now???
Really excited for this
This looks interesting and I like the facial expressions
to clean......... its TO CLEAN BRO
OMGGGGG THSI LOOKS SO GOOOOD
0:38 This line (as voice acted) doesn't flow smoothly into the next.
Who’s the robot girl
THIS. IS. GOING. TO. BE. EPIC.
I feel like if Bob did a face reveal he would look like these guys but with a large afro
They look like Sonic characters and I love that about them. ❤❤❤
10/10
Smg4 vs mikecrack
Ya Know what! IM FUCKING WATCHING THIS!!
Perfect the maker of Waifus who can tottaly kill us has returned *Liam Vickers*
Hmmm....this project looks interesting. I'll try and watch it when it's released
Oh no drones that kill
YOOOOOO
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA I AM SO EXCITED 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
we just ended the newest arc now were getting a new series? christ that was fast
The animation looks quite professional i must say.
I hope this is a movie
Damn you now I have another spark of hope in my life just let me be depressed in peace dang it
Finally i have been waiting for this to come out
Also not gonna lie it looks pretty cool
You have enough resources to make something called killer drones but not a season three for meta-runner what the heck❓❓❓❓❓❓❓❓❓❓❓❓❓❓❓❓❓❓❓❓❓!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I was hoping for Mr season 3 but damn this is good
EEEEE
Wow
In the words of Kermit I love murder I love killing
at first for some reason i thought they were making a game, they could still tho
Cant wait, love liams work, and this looks awesome
Plot Twist:  The parents company is Skynet
I like how the humans where like welp i guess i amma die
YOOOOOOOOOOOOOO, LIAM VICKERS IS FINALLY GETTING A FULL SERIES (I think)
Hopefully we’ll get a proper cast listing before the pilot airs. “N’s” voice sounds familiar for some reason and it’s driving me nuts! 😅
Can’t wait for the terminator anime you guys
Fuck yeah!
so rip humans again :D
Can't wait
Pass!
Can’t wait for this to come out, looks and sounds amazing.                But murder drones?
epic
Well, something just got my interest.
Can't wait for this series :)
Yoooo, that's really good!!
From a company owned by a random dude who mainly works on stupid Mario videos, this was kinda cool. Hope to see the episode soon!
This is very good sounding
this looks like  video game
As mario would say "ooh very scary"
Here I have around 30 unfinished stories on a Kindle Fire and here these guys are animating around 5 different stories!!! Where does this motivation come from?!?!..... I'm sad now.
OHHHH I'm excited to see this 😄
Welp time to theorize
I hope Saiko gets a series
I wonder who are the voice actors
I'm very hyped
YEEEEEEEEEEES
*HYPE HYPE HYPE HYPE HYPE-*
Remember when we thought that yellow drone was the MC? we were TRICKED!
Super upgrade of Henry stickman?
If Meta runner and paradise island was any good this is going to be the best thing to happen in my life
Love how the humans just said "guess i'll die" in their final moments
This looks cool ngl
Oooof niiiiice
Looks amazing
Was that Michael
Soooo who's the villain?
yeeesssss
This is very high quality. I can't wait.
This looks incredible! Also, I'm kinda getting Nier: Automata vibes for some reason.... XD
Good lord I see so much fanart and fanfiction material flooding from this 😳
META RNNER SEASON 3333333 PLEASE
Russia in 2077
Looks amazing
Ooooooooooooh
I'm hyped
This is gonna be the coolest glitch show so far! I cant wait!!
I'm going to watch this, fall in love with a character, and then watch them slowly die :(
Spooky month moment.
spanish subtitles, no :(
AMAZING
This looks dope
Time to put Montero with this to see if it fits :)
Can’t wait for this robo series to get crazy awesome
I WAS NOT EXPECTING THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! LIAM VICKERS MEETS SMG4!!!!?!??!?!?!! HOLY SHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Remember when this channel was about a dumb version of Mario doing dumb things?  We came a looong way...
0:19 guess we'll die
That... sound... EPIC
Wow,that actually looks cool!
If Liam Vickers Animation  is coming back, then that could mean that Cliffside could see the light at the end of the tunnel
THIS IS AMAZING! YES! FREAKING YES!
Nice
For the first half of my life i thought tari had to do something with the lore of the show
This looks like a really good series I love the art style and the animation everything and I love robots stuff
Is meta runner season 3 coming out soon :p
Yesssssss!!!!!
This looks really cool
HYPE
Damn, this looks good, and the ost seems insane, I'm looking forward to it. Great job once more.
Let's also not forget the fact that they are doing this without an SMG4 character.   Amazing Soundtrack, Amazing Trailer.
This year: shows on YouTube. Next year: full ass movies
😱🤯
This looks amazing!
it looks amazing i sure will watch it I just hope it has subtitles because I don't understand that much english
*Attention, everyone, run for your lives! Robots have taken over the world! [everyone is silent] Our world!* 🤣
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Kinda reminds me of homestuck with those wings
Hoooooo very scary.
Yes Yes Yes Yes YES
This looks INCREDIBLE!!!!

Forget the snow running red, I want to see it covered in blackened oil and grease!
Put Mario in this
Originally thought it said murder bones

LOOKS AWESOME :OOO
Well, who's ready to drop more money on plushies?                  *cough* *cough* me.
"So not devine!"  We. Needed. This. Forever.
OH MAH GOD! The premier is on my birthday! THANKS GLITCH FOR GIVING ME AN ADICTION, I LOVE THIS CHANNEL!!!
I'm excited about this new seasons i can not wait for it
I’m actually excited for a glitch show!
So, a killer drone is so lazy and cares so little about doing.... Whatever... That it literaly is rouge..... Never before seen procastination and lazyness be a virtue but im not complaining
That will be a great movie
This looks really cool~
This series feels like it has a lot more potential then summer set island. Could be more potential or even with meta runner
I’m so freaking excited for this series because sunset paradise was amazing series ever and I hope this series will be freaking insane again I’m so freaking excited 😁
I'm not sold on the animation yet, but this is definitely worth a watch when it comes out
When you call someone in fortnite a bot… and they take it literally
Hm, I love it
this is gonna be sick!
Where is this music from?
Bruh this show looks cool but where Spamton Reference
YES YES YES YES YES YES
LIAM IS ALIVE!
Now we lie and wait for the pilot
Sheeeesh! That's a 10/10 for me 👌
Omg can’t wait!
SUOER HYPER MEGA EPIC
YES YES YES YES
Pog
This looks great! Can't wait to check it out!
smg4: ''a lot of violence''   me: so this is basically uhh those robots in meta runner but killing each other right?  oh wait also is there going to be a ''if mario was in murder drones'' when the serie is completed?
When is  episode one please tell me I really want to know? Or is the plot episode one?
Can’t wait for it!!! Hype!!
Can't wait for it
Holy crap. That animation looks amazing.
This looks amazing
Выглядит афигенно!
uhhhh, im somewhat confused with the plot. is it about drones figting evil drones or something among those lines?
HOLY MOLY THIS LOOKS AMAZING
Is that a seperate continuity?
IM SORRY WAS THAT CAVE JOHNSON?!?!
Ngl I would rlly like to see this main character in SMG4
HYPE
Looks nice!
To be honest  not bad but its great
To quote a famous Crimson Nirnroot:    Muuuuurdur Tiiiiiiiime
terminator but more terminate and more or
Yes
Damm im so excited for ep1😁
OMG, it looks fantastic!!!
I love it
Uuuuuh
Mario: Look at this dude.....*laughs* Toad: "Toad bot 9000 is ready to slam doors on pinguses"
_what about meta runner?_
Really feels different than the other series
This will be in Netflix right?
YES
Murder robots?  IM IN.  HYPEEEEE
I am seriously interested in this.
Accepted for the war. 😊
I'm going to LOVE THIS SHOW
👀 Holy shit... I'm at a loss for words
I love this trailer 👍♥️
Found this channel from Liam mentioning it
Its moments like this that make me ask why they are drones instead of humans. If the only thing making them drones is thir body's, then what's the actual difference? At that point they're just people in drones bodys
Im looking forwad for this!
This is a lot more cute than the original teaser, I was expecting big spook but this is more fun. Oh well it's not like I'm going to not get addicted anyway.
Damn this looks amazing! I can’t wait for the premiere!
:o sounds nice
Nice, it feel like anime but with drones like in the future of machinery.
Looks really promising! To be honest, I'm hoping it'll be more serious like Metarunner is, and not like Sunset Paradise was with what felt like memes and jokes taking up a good chunk of what could've made it more interesting. I'm not saying I hate Sunset Paradise, I'm just saying I like the more serious show more than the joke show. Both were still good and I'm looking forward to this.
Still not Meta Runner season 3, but this looks amazing!
And to think we could’ve gotten a zombie apocalypse instead of this. 🦾🦿🔪
I AM SO EXCITED
I love it
I want to watch it
coming back too this planet after 3 years for this cause of my film maker i love
It sounds so good
omfg this looks so dope as hell can't wait!!!!!
I forgot I was even subscribed to this garbage channel. You're not forgiven, Luke, not now or ever
Looking to be quite a twisted and cute series. XD The fact that it's coming out later this month really feels fitting for obvious reasons.
wow. that's.. so... AWESOOMEEE!!! OOOOOOMMMMMMGGGGGGGG
AAAAAAA this is so well done I'm so excited to see it!!!!!!! ❤️❤️❤️ The visuals and the SOUNDTRACK sounds amazing
Emz voice🤨
This looks great
Man this is something I did not expect but it is interesting,cant wait for it to come out.
I'm sold on the character designs alone  They are so cool/cute
I hope is romance as well
Why does N remind me of 9S?
OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORD 💖💖💖💖💖💖
I just can’t wait
Epic
This is Doom in a nutshell:
This looks epic I can’t wait
Me: *whaches The trailer*  Me agany: wait a minute i have sin that killer robot before
I like the animation and they are very shiny ✨
This is gonna be epic
OH MY GOD MICHAEL KOVACH AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
IT LOOKS AWESOME
So dystopian robot civilization...what could go wrong?
sure
I feel like the 'literally so insanely suspicious' thing will becoma a meme.
The animation is pretty
Looks epic
I can wait
I prefer seeing your art style in 3D because BOY OH BOY ITS GORGEOUS i really want to know how to model mouths like that i find it hard to do so and there isn't any tutorials or guides that I can find
Ooooooooh boy I like where this is going
Hot dang!
Me: What comes first in mind?   Brain: Friday night funkin mod duuh
Yoooo yea baby this is what I been waiting for
Who is the protagonist Boy or girl o the group
Oh you you know we didn't kill all humans on earth don't worry
I’m excited
Getting real Hazbin Hotel vibes from this.
so no meta runner?
holy crap this looks like more of a movie than show
I'm genuinely pumped for this, it looks absolutely insane and the visuals are stunning!
Perfect for the Halloween season
This looks pretty good
This looks great but damm i didn't expect you guys to make something really dark.
This show has my full support and love backing it up  Continue the great work Luke and Kevin
The animation, the voice acting, the story, THIS IS GODLIKE
Liam Vickers animation + SMG4 =AWESOME!!! (and cute.)
Ohhh this looks cool
Alternate title: Murderer GameXplain logo.
Where’s Meta Runner S3?
20 days guys. Wait patiently
I’m not gonna lie this is the most hype Think I seen all year
give me more
Looks... AMAZING
The animation is TOO good for our mortalminds.
*If Mario was in Murder Drones* when?
I'm sorry but did I hear kaggy. I have to check again
Look this!oooooooooooio
This feels like Nier Automata, mixed with Touhou.
just so you know the humans aren't extinct, there on other planets
Madness combat but with drones be like
take my life savings now this is amazing
Happy Halloween
This will be *_SO GOOD!_*
cool studio, cool animation!!!
I think I liked the original concept of psycho-god wannabe as one of MC's but it looks really fresh and interesting. Looking forward to it!
Murder drone N already reminds me of 9S from Nier automata for some reason. This is gonna be good.
The strangest thing here is robots with hair
Oh hell yes
Okay, you have my attention
Can someone just get these guys network or streaming service deals already? They make better shows than most of the stuff on tv these days. They have real potential to become a great animation studio!
"Thats so not the vibe"   I can already tell this show is bound to be hilarious
Shut up and take my likes
Poggers.
Humans killed themselves but had robots to take over the world whilst their ded.     People really are idiots
Again absolutely stunning
Nice a new original! I always loved Meta Runner over new SMG4, and this has got me really excited on what you're gonna do with this world!
Okdoki
Cheeses
*Thats the literally the most perfect thing ever i want to watch it so bad and i see its gonna become something i'll watch everyday trying to end it and it looks so good just take your time to release it.*
Idk why but when I saw the “Robots” and how they looked (and I know it just me) but they remind me of splatoon How? Teen or kid sized robots? Post-apocalyptic world where humanity got screwed over (themselves) or…..(that’s it only those two)
Yoyoyoyo!!! This looks amazing¡¡!
No offense but it looks better than meta runner
oh jeez this is ambitious
This is awesome!!! I can’t wait
I already like it
Yes.
Here we go *Mario voice because I can do hiss voice irl*
Cant believe netflix hasn't contacted you yet       Or have they?
I'm gonna like this show
I am hyped! It is high time for the developed robot concience to be the good guys!
it alright
I cant wait to tell my future children how good this was, maybe a few years later
Wahhh, it's great
HOLY SHIT this looks epic!
It looks so good so far!
Can't wait for it,  It already looks awesome 😁
Noice
Holy frick this is amazing.
I've always wanted to voice act, maybe on day i can be on one of there shows!
looks sick
Can't wait to watch it!
This looks good, good job Glitch
YES LIAM GOT A FULL SERIES
You are so cool
this actually looks interesting
Nice vid Violece is nice (jkjkjkjkjkjkjkjjkjkjjk)
Anyone else get reminded of the robots for that game in mega runner
YES!!!! IT CAME!!!! IT FINALLY CAME!!!! THIS IS GONNA BE SO EPIC!!!! YES!!!! SUPER EPIC TO SEE IT LIKE ABOUT 3 WEEKS LEFT BEFORE THE PILOT STARTS!!!😆😆😆😆😆😆😉👍
Literally I, This is TOO good!...TOOO GOOD-
Can’t wait
🤯whoa this is dope 🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
You teamed up
A Glitch project and Vickers animation
Holy crap, this actually looks insanely good! Super excited!!!
This looks awesome I can't believe how far they have come
I’m interested. Can’t wait for the pilot/first episode!
Plot very different from what original channel had. Could be interesting tho since humans are to easy to be defeated by bots
It looks like the villain is the factory that sends that robot killers robots
If Mario was in murder drones
IM realy fucking exited to see that IT look awsome as fuck!
Looks really good
Epic
Don't know how but to me it sounded a little similar to the opening to the final season of AOT (Attack On Titan)
I cant tell if its a movie or series
I'm excited
This feels like Nier Automana mixed with Hazbin Hotel/Helluva Boss!  This should be fun
Damn I am really excited for this, it looks great!
i can tell its gonna be good
Is it just me or are the murder drones giving me Exorcist (Hazbin Hotel) vibes
Plzz make more metarunners
Woah😱
0:46 why does that pink eyed girl look like a Gacha character?
so cool no it's so awesome
Glitch: points to murder drones this is amazing Me: but I want this Meta runner season 3
Woah this is way too good
I was waiting for this woo
i know this is gonna find a way to be super emotional at one point, anyone wanna guess how
Me: expecting it to be meta runner season 3 ,yes yes yes 'killer robot'  No no shit fuck        Ps still love the work you guys put into this
This is going to be lit.
Btw, to anybody not from Liam: go check out the creator's channel, Liam Vickers Animation. He's made a full-length pilot for a series called CliffSide and is currently making an episodic series called Internecion Cube, of which 3 episodes have been released and are also amazing. From the looks of it, Murder Drones has a similar humor style, so I'm sure if you like this you'll like his other work.
Let's Go ❤
This is one interesting concept...            I'M IN!
WELP that looks like madness combat im not gonna lie
Congrats to Liam! I've been waiting for the series to come out.
What happened to meat runner :troll:
The voice of N...  Charlie Schlatter, is that you?
Fans: Can we have Meta Runner Season 3? Glitch: 2 new shows. Take it or leave it.  Jokes aside, this legitimately looks awesome, I can't wait to see what this becomes!
I feel like that show might be like squid games for some reason but i don't know why (btw not into squid games just saying that)
Classic interjection cube style but in 3D
For a second I thought it said meta runner season 3 trailer.
Oh boi. It's-a time to die!
Master chief or Noble-six easter egg please
Recover the memory chips and whatever parts you can and if you think about it nobody dies, robots can rebuild eachother after all  W E  N E V E R D I E (Until we age and rust)
Wow amazing
This looks insane
Not bad not bad
Holy shit it's the grin she's making the Liam grin it's happening oh god
Looks like Fawful's Minion might enjoy this show very much!
Damn I'm super hyped!
This is going to be messed up as hell
Just in time for Halloween.  Someone get ready to contact Dead Meat, and see if James will make an exception for this series!
That theme song is AMAZING!!!!
I can't wait for like the first episode of this good job smg4 good job
Haven't been this hyped for a while.
welp this was unexpected
Is the 1st episode gonna be on Thai channel?
Lizilla:It's spooky month, and the less anime tropes this show has, the better
That got more Budget than RWBY
me want see
Hang on a tick, what if this takes place in the Meta Runner universe?
Sorry if this is stole but I’m pretty certain that the nice murder drone the protagonist met is going to die
We're eating good this year
huh.
YES I LOVE IT DO IT 2 SEASONS P L E A S E
This is Animation history.
Cool but why to create a videogame ?
Awesome
Gosh dang. I am looking forward to this series. The story sounds interesting and awesome
Aughahahaha great
It's about time you guys made a new show.
WOW! This looks so AMAZING! I CAN'T WAIT FOR THE PILOT EPISODE!!!
Can't wait for the first episode this is gonna be good
this better not be a new smg4 character too
This is Awesome! Who else agrees?
"PILOT EPISODE DROPS October 29 2021" Alright bet 😎
Visually, this looks STUNNING! Can't wait for it!!
So is this based off intercion cube
This is creepy
Woah i can't wait for all of us to see it dude it's let fire💥💥
Vreated by Liam Vickors is all I needed to see.  Im in.
mmmk interested.
Why do robots kill each other do they hate each other?
I pissed myself waching this and i couldn't be happier
Okay this is going to be interesting then Sunset Paradise and meta Runner okay not going to lie here that's not true they're really good shows trust me you're going to want to watch him
The main character should become a regular character in the smg4 series only after their show though
"it doesn't count as blood if it isnt organic" -random 13 year old
Is this cybergoth or cyberpunk?
Ok now this lit
Liam pog
Halo X Star Wars? *Oh this is gonna be good*
Guy who makes creepy cute girls with sharp teeth getting his own show, YEEESSSSSS.
I'm already loving it, let's hope it's as amazing as meta runner! (Or even better)
*Initiate excitement protocol. Hype levels increased sustantially.*
Random robot: We're here to wipe out humanity and take over the- where did they go?  Geordie robot: they wiped themselves out  Random robot: really? Oh well, swings and roundabouts
Looks so Chaotic and Cool this anime.
My robot waifu
THIS IS SO GOOD AND WELL DONE OMG IM EXCITED
I refuse to believe this is actually free to watch.
No meta runner this year );
0:53 it literally looks like a scene from a movie created by a large animation studio
Soundtrack sounds so whimsical but spooky, looking forward to watching this 😊
Where is meta season 3
I can see that it will take a long time by it so fluent
i rlly like the ennemies
BRO THE THEME IS A BOP
0:55
is this gonna be a game?
Its... beautiful.😢
Anyone else HYPE FOR THIS
Honestly seems a bit lacking in what I loved about what Liam originally had on his channel but also I'm absolutely still gonna watch it. I hope he gets more shows in the future and still has time to continue his personal channel projects.
SMG4 really went from Mario bloopers to this. shows how he evolved over the years.
this looks ...FUCKING AWESOME!!!
Wait will the main character will become in SMG4? CONFIRM?
You know the Meta Runner Store Clerk is gonna appear in this series one day.
At least this is not worse than KSI drones, those things were a pain in the ass
It always fascinates me when new worlds are made like this, like I can think of stories based off of x y or x or have inspiration from that, but this is something amazing, it’s like something I would’ve watched on Cartoon Network, it’s just given me that childish giddiness!! And it may be late but it feels like a birthday thing too somewhat  😂
Looks promising!
I love this already. Probably because I play too much DOOM Eternal and watch a lot of Madness Combat.
𝙃𝙔𝙋𝙀
:O I CANT WAIT FOR THE PIOLIT
IM HYPED
I just realized every time glitch makes a animated series it's always girl main characters have you noticed that cuz I noticed that I know I'm a guy but I'm just going to say this girl power!
remember, murder is ok
Glitch just keeps on getting better and better.
OMFG! I love it! 😁
Pretty cool but could use more spider girls
CAN'T WAIT
This should be game as well
I gotta say! To me, this series seems like quite the twist from the original Glitch Productions formula with their other shows!
Oh my God the graph is so insane holy crap it that was amazing oh my God you guys see the thing with the thing!!!!!
I almost thought this is another series for one of the female  smg4 characters  Meggy=sunset paradise  Tari=meta runner
Yes. OH my god yes
Necesito MAAAAS
THIS LOOKS SO GOOD OMFG
WOAH WOAH WOAAAAAAAH WOAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH WOOOOOAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
This seems so cool
This looks like a great show to binge can't wait
Well, I guess this is one way to get your Nier: Automata fix.
Maybe this is something that is making up what happened on my birthday last year, I might get to celebrate my birthday that day.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKDT-tjFXYg at 7:37 leak footage of the new series
OOooooo
Super Wooooooooooow otra serie además de meta runner y sunset Paradise
My brain when a legend and legend work together  .....
Yesyesyes
And the graphics sheeeeesh
*Show of hands, who believes this series will also get the same treatment as his other work?*
LET'S GOOO POST CAPITALIST HELLSCAPE
I’m neutral with this, leaning a bit on the positive side. Not a fan of anime or anime-like voices, but the animation looks good.
So..... no Meta runner season 3?
To be honest I was expecting something very different you like humans but now they extinct, not going to lie this is awesome but I wonder how they're going to pull off the horror theme even though they already showed.  So robots versus robots essentially hm interesting concept though again I can't expect you like the murder drones killing people but... I CAN'T FCKING WAY UNTIL THE PILOT EPISODE!!
LESS GO
This looks poggers
Spooky series debuting on Spooky Month.
Let’s go first tarry then maggy now this lets gooooo
I am intrigued. Nice animation as well.
YYEEEEEEEAAAAH
Daaaaaaaaaamn looks INCREDIBLE !! Can't wait
Y e s
I will burnt the date it comes out into my brain
Ohhh boi
Why does it seem like the song "The Catalyst" by Linkin Park would suit this new show very well?
You already know this Is going to be great.
I think I'm inlove with this song
Nier Automata The animated series
0:36 "our parent company didn't exactly love the concept of runaway AI..." *Umm, Quack?* Edit: the glitch team has come so far, I'm proud of them Edit 2: 1:09 IS THAT DAN GREEN???!!
Wow based off Global Warming or Climate Change or how humanity is completely stupid and suck at taking care of their planet ?
A series about a robot civil war. Great
This had me at violence also I like to design😎👍❤
The main character looks like Jaiden
{No Comment Found}
This looks awesome!!!
*Okay, but wait. What about the girl from cube? Is she apart of this?*
Seems a little cringy but lets see how this turns out
This looks awesome
HYPE
se ve chido xd
New series love it hope to see it soon
I doubted this show after seeing a bit odd looking 3D teaser instead of usual 2D animation. But holy hell that new trailer looks dope! All doubts are gone, can’t wait to watch the whole thing :D   GG guys!
Plz make this really early also why does it seem the main character is always a girl
thats just sonic
okay i'm excited
DAMN this looks so interesting!, i'll make sure to tune in when it drops!
tbh                                           this isn't just cool                                                     *it is EPIC TO THE 327956320981578932175893217589I728913I7579812796969696969696969669692174892358962893569235632563912559315TH POWER*
im legitematly scared cus the original was a runaway robot and a human who just wanna get back home but this is something else so please dont ruin this glitch.... please
If you make the main character s voice a bit more bitchy she sounds like Evelyn ( hope I spelt her name right) from meta runner
Im hyped
I can't wait 😎👌
Aaaaand i already love it
God... damn
What a good trailer! I look forward to it
This looks amazing
Oh man, You've made a movie better than the disney live actions
So did the Drones cause the mass death or just survived it? Thats gonna heavly impact the faction i side with.
Now I have something to watch
Robots killing Normal Worker Robots  Imagine the meeting that took place, to pitch that idea. Totally doesn't sound like it couldn't backfire.
Love the vids
Looks sick!
I already know this is gonna be awesome because Liam created it.  But seriously, this looks fuckin' great.
its like an actual movie trailer :0
🤩🤩🤩
Wow this looks epic I'm looking forward to it
Smg4 is always known for amazing work and story.
So bots are built by a mega-corp to mine planets, but humans die due to accident. Mega-corp assumes bots went rogue and send terminators to eradicate the bot population. One terminator is cognitive enough to listen to the miner bots and the plot begins. Interesting enough.  Not a fan of the director's older projects, but I guess I'll give the pilot a watch just to see if its interesting enough.
Oh my days what the actual hell did is just saw that was amazing.
so.... WHERE will this pilot actually take place?
I’m looking forward for this :))
All of these series are so cringe but so entertaining and I dont really mind cringe unless im at a friends house
⚠️WARNING⚠️ don’t watch this trailer unless you want to feel unmatched depression until the main series is out.
Nice
This will be a great project, it’s humor, the visuals and the characters so far seem great! I hope this will be the greatest project Glitch has ever made!
unmanned aerial vehicle with homicidal intentions
This is looks sick!
was wondering how the animators would incorporate Liam's visceral designs. They went the Tartakovsky route and made all the things getting ripped to shreds robots.
Ahhhh can’t wait!!! It’s like watching a Tv show, but I’m yt!!!
Please add Russian subtitles, I will be grateful.
Hype.
The one in the at the desk sounds like Charles from Henry Stickmin
Dude this feels like a Pixar or a Disney  film lmao
Machines are superior to humans they say.... Yet what's happening here? Machines versus machines. Not lookin so superior huh?
From the same people behind "Meta Runner", and "Mario Gets His PINGAS Stuck in a Door", in association with the guy behind "Cliffside", and "Interception Cube", MURDER DR💀NES!
This looks interesting
I’m investing my entire time for this series and will not skip any ads from this
QUÉ!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?
All I can say is:      I'm hyped.
Oh man I wanted Mario dancing like I was promised
Looks good I can't what to see it. I hope they go into depths on the mechanics 9f it though
Wow
this feels like if madness combat and my life as a teenage robot had a kid
Ok I'm very excited
i want this on netflix
AWESOME!!!!
only 20 days until it the pilot is here :D
I wonder if rule 34 artist gonna speedrun this show’s character
POGPOGPOGPOGPOGPOGPOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOG
Smg4 has made his own Metroid Dread
When the drone is sus
I'm psyched to finally watch a finished Liam Vickers project.
Honestly, the 3D animation feels out of place
ima bet this is in the same universe as meta runner (THOUSANDS OF YEARS AFTER IT) and they all died leaving robots to take over
All man so ready for this. Love your channel by the way Liam Vickers Animations.
Woah this looks sick
Me yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
That’s why they always running
They shut link this to meta runners that would be amazing . Can’t wait btw who Els is 🔥
THIS LOOKS AMAZING!!
YES YES YES YES
Quality, action, humour and trauma? SIGN ME UP
This is why I want to be an animator
Interesting
Nice Trailer. 😃😃😃 It looks interesting. By the way the Killer dones reminds me the Exterminators from Hazbin.
Me omw to make ocs already
This is the only thing I want now from this channel
So that’s what this was
Looks like a videogame :$
*Humanity is extinct like the dinosaurs* *Murder Drones are the new species on Earth and they’re starting to kill each other for some reason* *Most of all, there will be a lot of sense of humor* *This is going to be interesting!*
Anyone tell me a quick summary?
Welp reddit is going to be nut about this
There looks like Very AWSOME and fantastic and you Channel is just AWSOME
holyyyy shit <3
Oh yes...heheh...ohhhh yes
Heck yeah more characters to love then cry because they're DED 🙂❤

Ooo wow...is there new character in smg4 like "NEW ENEMY IT'S MURDER DRONE! "
Yes it good animation
Omg, can't wait for it!!! You guys are the best!
There’s only gonna be 2 episodes of this because of how well animated it is it will take too long 😍😍
Rooster Teeth, Take Notes. This is how to be a badass animation studio without selling out and screwing over you employees and fans.
SMG4, yet another masterpiece is coming from your idea vault! Can't wait!
soooo they' re drones... that commit... murder...  (tbh this looks really cool!)
This looks SICK
Well, im hooked.
LETSSS GOOOO
I LOVE IT
Holy crap! This looks amazing!!! CAN'T WITH FOR THE 29TH!!!

plot: robot simping
Welp......reddits gonna have fun with this
I love the guy who said that’s so not the vibe
YES ORIGINAL STUFF
Yo where is meta runner
1:15 That gave me Natsuki vibes.
What's funny is that one channel's been giving teasers for three months  now and no one noticed
Dude!!! This is Insane~ I can't wait :D
This is gonna be amazing
Oh heck yes!
can't wait to watch internecion cube but  with a actual animation budget
Bro this is some next-leveled shit!
The animation and lighting looks hella cool!
PLEASE GLITCH, GIVE US META RUNNER SEASON 3!!!!!!!!
Compared to Meta runner, I think I like these character designs better.
'did you just slap me with that hand?'
Best trailer I ever seen but like META RUNNER SEASON 3 NEEDS TO COME OUT SOON
Glitch make this a game
The music sounds cool
Bruh, i thought it was a videogame
Getting some BIG TIME Internecion Cube vibes over here. Anyone else?
This looks pretty interesting.
You should make a show for Melony
.-. ok good proyect
Can I be in Murder Drones I can help draw up some people and do some voices for them
This looks amazing! I can’t wait for this!!!
Me: Where Meta Runner season 3? SMG4: Murder drone Me:... SMG4:...  Me: *Y E S*
Holy sh!t This looks epic
[insert obligatory what about Meta Runner comment here]  This looks absolutely sick fr tho
ICH LIEBE ES!!!
LETS GOOOOOOOO!!!!! Murder Drones is here, and I can't wait to watch it!
Well that looked good
Remember guys, this is coming from the same guy who had the idea of a chain chomp being released
This is going to be awesome. Love it
When is Meta runner season 3 coming out
So fucking awesome. So fucking hype.
i love everything about this, but honestly the lip syncing could use some wor
Gotta be honest, I got an ad for Eternals before this video, and I am more excited for this series.
Vampire robots destroy the world Yes
owo
Hey GLITCH, are you gonna make pilot merch to celebrate the pilot for Murder Drones coming out like you did with Sunset Paradise
new netflix movie trailer
Rip season 3 meta fun 😢😢
Ok this actually looks cool
Looking forward to this
Yes yes yes
This has the energy of those dubstep covers, which are already atmospheric. The personality and atmosphere are outstandingly done guys. Keep up the good memes
Sooo I thought I heard Cameron Cambell. That would be neat
The fact we killed ourselves is saying something
"Did you just slap me with that arm ?"
...wish one of his other projects got made.
**Madness: Project Nexus crossover intensifies**  Or Tankmen, whichever more matches the vibe of this series...
I get a sort of metroid,Helo even slight 9 Vibe from this
holy moly
I wonder what the company will be or if it will be like Detroit Become Human.
:00000000
CAN'T WAIT! Been watching Liam for a while and now they're back and working with GLITCH. This is going to be a good series
This looks great to bad it looks like the trailer spoiled one of the big twists but other then that, very hyped.
Me looking through youtube and finding smg4 big project: "Uh... let me guess... Meta runner season 3?" Me after watching the video: *" It's... PERFECT! "*

Beautiful
this looks like its going to be funny, badass, and pure awesome. i am SO looking forward to seeing this!
Wow the quality has increased a lot!
After soo long this popped out of nowhere.
What the hell is this 😓
The pilot releases on the last day of my internship. "Every ending holds a new beginning" said someone before leading a Murger Drone "here".
fucking epic
Murder Drones, like simple drones being hit from a bunch of Spidermen?
LETS GOOO
OOOOOO
So the robots didn’t wipe humanity We did that ourselves? Seems legit
This background music gives me Portal/Portal 2 vibes
“Post Apocalyptic world with Robots” sounds prefect to me  Edit: Forgot the part where there is one just straight up killing them
LETS-A FUCKING GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
I love Liam's "So not divine! D:"
The link was in the description
Hail.
This looks really cool
This looks so good
This genuinely looks like the best thing I've ever seen :0
dinosaurs. But Humans
I am the first man to draw murder  drones
This is meta runner but literal cyborgs now LOL
YOO, I’m really excited for this. Glad Liam gets his own show from GLITCH, wonder if there’s gonna be any references to Liams older works  Edit: 0:23 an explosion rocked the room softly
So not Internecion Cube. Well ok im into int now and loving the trailer
0:46 *Liam is that you??*
At one moment the back ground music sound like one from l4d2 campaign Dark Carnival "Gallery"
I'm picking up what your putting down
Now this is gonna be good.
Wow... This looks amazing
Это будет великолепным подарком на хеллуин! Ждём пилот, ну и сабов от хороших людей.
I can't wait any longer
hey could you subtitle it in spanish
cool
hell yeah
The Robots in this animation are Cute, and WOW this is going to be Awesome
First there was Meta Runner, then Sunset Paradise and now its murder drones. I know this will be a good series as we wait for a season 3 of meta runner and season 2 for Sunset Paradise
Honestly I thought this was a game by Nintendo
Oh my god this looks amazing, i'm so excited for the pilot to drop
Cool!:D
I just love how those guys shrug before part of the Earth's surface blows up XD
Ok but... meta runner
I love what I'm seeing😍
This looks insane can’t wait
Holly cow I am exited for this it lookkkkkkssss sooooo coooolllllllllllllll!!!!!!
I would really like to play a game about that
Love the story concept! The character designs are great and the animation is wonderful!
Can I just say, that this is finally the chance Liam gets to redeem himself?
definetly hyped for this
I love this series already
Honestly, it looks like a kid show
Meta Runner: Can't get enough.  Sunset Paradise: Failed to grab my attention after the Pilot.  Murder Drones: I like this concept...
hmmm mabye after this ark the min robot will join the main cast?
Nice
You can really tell Liam Vickers helped because its a lot like his animation and the voice actors are here too.
I like it BUT!I think,will be better if animations would be a little bit sharpnes,cuz it looks like slow.(Im not animator,so im probably I'm wrong and I'm just complaining cu I like 2D classic animation more )
This looks so cool, I already love it :)
SMG4, do you have a fetish with making female main character?
This is so cool New Video Official Trailer I'm So very Exitced
Looks good, I'm excited.
I like the collabe with liam, this is gonna be epic
Too bad there is no sleeper program for humanity tho... Unless??
Ooooo interesting
Awesome!
this is really cooland caught my interest!
Is that kaggy???
WHY DOES EVERY ROBOT SERIS HAVE TO BEGIN WITH THE ERADICATION OF HUMANITY?!
Yo     This looks sick
dang it cool
First frame and it's already so amazing.
So amazing it’s like a triple a movie
Unfortunately that Murder Drones wasn't set in the VGR Era.  Murder Drones will set in the Alternative Universe or Something.  I'll find out soon for my VGR Content.
I love the facial expressions
This looks good but I'm still waiting on for more Metta Runner where is season 3???
i love Liam Vickers stuff, he has such a recognizable style, and its great to see him make new stuff with a bigger budget!
E
Where's meta runner season 3? 😁
HOLY SHITO! THIS LOOKS PHENOMENAL
RIP my theory about this show being about the underworld and melony going to save axol.
Hype be like

Why do I wanna hug the baby bots?
This show reminds me of astro bots 😊
Damn, this some Deltarune Chapter 2 x Resident Evil Village type shit... I'm so going to watch this series when the pilot drops... :)

Opinions here, anyone?
those murder robots kinda look like flandre from touhou
#Robotapocolypse
Now I know why this looks so familiar I saw it from the original art content creator
You this look sick
Humans killing themselves to extinction seems like it would happen
This could easily have or become a video game. It's perfect! It's amazing!
This show looks great
Now this is a new type of blood warning
:D
when you realize *the human race eradicted their own entire species*
Man this is dark but cool
The quality on this is so good I can feel my brain overload!
Okay, this is actually freaking amazing.
Damn this looks epic!
I'm Tripping. I didn't even know ow this was glitch until I aw the logo lmao 😂
0:55, MICHAEL KOVACH?!
Как-то слишком жизнерадостно и ярко Ну ничего, посмотрим, что из себя это представляет
Jesus Christ I love this. When this comes out, I’m binge watching it to the end.
This is so cool!!!! I love it!!!
Welp we have to wait 3 weeks
Randomrobot:So not divine :me best show ever
This is one of the most exciting things I’ve seen all year!
A world where robots exist and humans are extinct. Welcome to the year 4069.
excited for this!
Oh my God...
Well at least we know what happened to all those Toms after they took the Vindication. Edit: Theory time  When Tari was introduced in Ultimate gamer (uploaded on August 25  2018) she was still a character used to promote the up and coming meta runner (The trailer was uploaded on December 5 2018). And this might be a bit of a stretch but Meggy got her humanoid voice in WOTFI 2020 (it was uploaded in august 22) now although an entire years off My new adventure (Uploaded on March 12/13 of 2021) used to promote Sunset Paradise (Now mind you the trailer for sunset paradise was on may 12th and the first ep was on the 28th) Now here me out using this evidence (And yes its circumstantial evidence) the Smg4 gang is going to get a new companion that represents Murder Drone probably this week (time of this edit october 12) or the next week
great visuals and story indeed.
Woah :O animation is soo cool
This looks amazinng
I wonder what her name is🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔
This looks so fucking cool
I am so looking forward to this! :D
Brain.exe has stopped working
ITS ABOUT TIME!!!!!
Hype
Dark and humorous, I like it.
This going to be amazing!!! This is whole feeling is very different with this edgy vibe that I see. I can’t wait to see what GLITCH and Liam Vickers have in store for us on the weekend on Halloween (10/29).
all Smg4's shows look like games and i would LOVE to see a game from Smg4
i dont have words....my mind just explote like the planet jsjsjsjsj LOOKS AMAZING!!!!
WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
This looks dope asf. I can't wait to watch the pilot. Honestly this looks like something you'd find on Netflix. Amazing job team
Aaaaaand now we're waiting for "What if Mario was in Murder Drone".
Cool
Excited this looks like its gonna be great
Wait y do those diseins look filmara yes I don’t know how to spell
This looks fricking amazing-
Someone give this dude a tv show!
Youre telling me this is the same guys who made Who Let the Chomp Out, Freddy's Spaghettria, and the Ssenmodnar series??
This looks like the next thing I'm going to be obsessed with
Holy crap, dude the animation and graphics just took a GIANT leap in quality O_O NICE!!
a small team, yet a massive project.
a cameo of someone like SMG1 would fit perfectly here
Bruh hyyyyyype! Good work guys can’t wait for it
aaaaa i can't waitt asfadgfadg
Finally, another original series. :D
Unexpected.
Did zero alive went in a Nother dimension
Yayyyyy
This looks pretty sick
Kay this looks Awesome!!! 🤩🤩🤩
Hard to believe that this is the same group of people who made a gmod animation of Mario getting his pingas stuck in a door
Meta runner next year then
Who is serial designation N voiced by? I feel like i know them from somewhere
SO AWESOME and SO INTENSE AND 😃😃😃😎😎😎😎
This looks like something I'm gonna watch, but does it have anything to do with the SMG4 lore? Also I am really looking forward to this! òwó
Just you wait in several Months there will be an "If Mario was in murder Drones"
Honestly I can't write a joke comment, I can't wait for this, I love it already.
The title it self is already insane
Can't wait! :D
*Seeing all of those skeletons and the abandoned cities reminds me of The Terminator movies*
:0
SMG4 rlly be improving
I'm not really interested in smg4/Glitch series aside from the main Mario one, but GOD THIS ONE LOOKS SIIIICKKKK
boy am i excited for this. liam and glitch working together is a dream come true
caused by robots blood and gore rated R for robots
the show looks stunning, with every show glitch produces the animation and quality goes up drastically
I'm only a few seconds in and it Already looks amazing
Awesome I can't wait  to see it
Epic.
Imagine the budget for this I mean luck at these graphics. This was totally worth the wait!
5th time watching the trailer and just now noticing the coats on the murderdrones....  THE WORKERDRONES ARE IN ZE ATTIC!
'Well, houdy hoe, Robots! You know what that means, I can be as hardcore as i want and it will still be PG13 hehehheha! umm delicious Ultra Voilence!!'  - YGOTAS Melvin Episode 56
This kinda reminds me of Neir: Automata and Bayonetta as a mixed in a series? Love it 😍👍🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
This is cool but don’t u think this is a bit far it went from vacation to killer robots lol
Meta runner season 3:I'm next Murder Drones:Are you sure about that
Yoooooooo
It looks awesome
. . . . . . .  yes
WOOOOH
can we all go extinct now
This will definitely be quite a treat
Noice

Holy shit this actually looks and sounds pretty good. I wonder when people will start making their own robot OC’s for this lol
Omg this is insanely pretty
Looks interesting ^u^
This looks really interesting I love the concept can't wait to see it
Anyone else notice one of the characters voices is bow?
Bro, I can't believe that every time glitch produces a new show it looks so good.
So excited for this, looks amazing
This is... surprisingly unexpected. Interesting concept, curious for the execution
Can't wait just got hooked just buy watching tralier
Now this is my typa show!!
Can October 29th get here any faster?!
looks promising cant wait to see it
Well the animation and lighting are (insert emperor’s new groove meme)! Also this is going to be a robotic gore fest! I’m talking scrap metal and oil everywhere! (Le popcorn and drink prepped) okay I’m ready for this!
OK, considering this is a series about robots killing Eachother, there's 1 thing to keep in mind:  *Do not get attached to the characters*
This. THIS right here. This is the best thing to come out of this channel in my opinion. I am so interested in seeing where this series goes and where Mr. Vickers takes us. Can’t wait to see the pilot!
Seems interesting cant wait
Man it's so nice to see Liam able to fulfill his idea, I have to thank the Glitch team for helping this fella and hope you have a great cooperation with a wonderful final product!
Holy shit I’m hyped
I just found the best thing ever in my whole life.
I'M SUPER HYPE!!!
Uh you sussy bakas are about to make me act up.
Well.  This is  Gonna be a  Fun  Series To Watch.
What!!!!!!!!!!!
Amazing Look !
So humans BLEW UP THEIR OWN PLANET before they found a habitable planet?
this looks super cool!
oooooooooooooooo looks dope asf

HYPE FOR THE PILOT! WOO! Bro, this looks amazing! I'm so exciting!

I can’t believe the Guy who making Mario bloopers collab with Liam Vickers to making a nee animation.
THIS IS GOING TO BE PROMISING
Finally!
Am I the only one noticing a pattern with the leads?
Just 504 hours until the release.
HOLY CRAP THIS IS WHAT LIAM HAD BEEN DOING  FOR THE PAST YEAR!? Insane!
Guns
👌🐷👍
Subtitle someone please!
The other Liam sent me  (Vickers)
Meta runner was good, Sunset paradise was not that great but this looks interesting
El XD
*Murder Drones exists.* Rule 34 Drone: Even technology... Will LEWD technology.
well damn. i expected it to be amazing, but at the same time, i didn't expect it to be this amazing. clearly the smoothest animation you've made yet!
This definitely looks like the biggest project yet. Can't wait for the pilot episode!
I feel like there's an imposter amongst them
No offense but I dont get what's happening
Yo yo yo Here to see funny Spooky robot girls lel XD
we got more waifu's
Honestly looks better than Meta Runner, MR is still a good series.
HYPED
TAKE MY MONEY
Too dangerous and the same time cool  He would slice Mario in half
*When you realize that the series comes out exactly 1 year after the last Internecion Cube episode came out:* *A small price to pay for salvation....*
This looks so good
Cool
I am so hyped.
New serie is awesomen
HYPE!!!!
This looks great, definitely going to check it out when it comes out. Art style also reminds me a lot of Spiral Knights, which is a game I haven't played in several years, so now I want to play it because of this lol
this reminds me of mega man x
YES
Excitement intensifies
Dang this looks dynamite and a little creepy☠☠☠☠☠☠
I was here
i turned off the pc literally the minute before the notisication and i had to turn it on solely for that
In time I decided to look at your channel.
My, MY! That is a vary interesting surprise SMG4! oh and yeah, the music sounds so sick, and I like it! cant wait to see it!  oh by the way... I think I knottiest that this up coming series texters look so much HD then your other series. that's what I think, just saying.
Kinda gives me Nier: automata vibes if it was mixed with the dark souls
This looks so hype on god
I like it
This is probably going to be the best animation that Glitch has done. The graphics and stuff are all so different from MR and Sunset Paradise. I’m excited for this
Ahhhhhhh I can't wait!
OK who needs TV and netflix when you can have THIS
Boi! It is time! Im so hyped👍
These guys don’t stop making fucking bangers do they
The budget for this is high
0:15 The Terminator: Dèja vù...
Ok not as bad as I thought
using robots is just an excuse to show things that cant be shown when using humans
That look AMAZING, the only think i would love is that there is literally 1 human left After what i like to call: "the freezing" who serve a some sort of story-teller of what happened but on the human side not the robot side..... And then getting killed 2 minute After because of a rogue Killer robot, that would be dope AF, anyways, good jobs, glad to be part of this community, you Always brigten my days :D
MORE
YES YES YES YES YES YES
This looks like something interesting. I’ll find time to watch during the British season on A9 Switch. Keep it up Glitch Productions! 👍😎

"Did you seriously let a murder drone in here??!" My brain: "think mark, think!"
It’s Alr I guess but fuck yes I’m seeing this
Oh cool a school shooter
Looks amazing 🤩 and the music in the background gave me the best kind of chills. The animation looked extremely fluent with a amazing design and just overall vibe. I can't wait to see this!

Deutsche Untertitel bitte
So. When are the r34 artists going to arrive?
when you are exo drones
Not only does this sound like it’ll have a good plot but HOLY FUCK that animation is so clean.  Dude was right, this IS probably gonna be one of his biggest projects yet
This is probably better than like 60% of series on Netflix
Wow! Didn't know what to expect but I was not disappointed this looks intresting
Hyped! The animation is so smooth! Well job guys! Can't wait to see what you've made! Already loved it!
Yo this looks sick
Idk why but 0:22 is already looking amazing what makes me more interested in the new upcoming series.
POG
This Needs To Be A Game One Day, This Looks Like It Would Fit As A Game
First year quarantine season 2 of meta runner second year sunset paradise and the trailer for murder drones
For a second there I forgot this was coming glitch
This looks great. And we all will support it and everything else to the end. Keep up the amazing work, dudes!
2B looking kind of different now a days
hype.
the improvement of glitch is unreal
I have a half day when the pilot drops
In the words of Meggy: "This is gonna be good!"
just saw this 0:
*When the series has more than 1 murder waifu:* *It's beautiful.*
This looks so dope
I wonder if anyone in this series is gonna be added to the main crew
Oh boy, I wonder how much this one costed Kevin and Luke
I CANT WAIT AAAAAAA
THIS LOOKS AWESOMEEE
[red megalovania intensified]
IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS!!!!!!!!!
I can tell this is gonna be LEGENDARY!
This. Is. Perfection! Can’t wait for the pilot! 🤩.
I wanna be part of this I WANT TO BE A BOICE ACTOR I DO GREAT VOICES I CAN DO A VERY GOOD VILLAIN VOICE aswell as a dialogue OF EVIL and I could help with ideas if the show becomes a huge hit I promise I’ll be great
Awesome!!! I wonder if it’ll be 10 episodes long
I think I'm in love with this series because it's super epic!!!!
Looks violent. I'm definitely down to watch it
OMG!! GIMMIE! GIMMIE! GIMMIE! GIMMIE! GIMMIEEEE!!!! I WANT IT SOO BADLY!!!! >w<
Looks freaky I like it
Is this another banger I'm seeing?
I cant wait for it these will be epic
Waifus AND Husbandos!?!? This might be the best show yet! That said, I do really hope that it leans into the horror-comedy aspect we get from Liam.  Liam is one of my favorite indie animation channels and I hope they are able to make this full of horror and suspense.
THE DESIGNS! They are so cool
This show looks so intense
Wait he is a male????????
pog
"Our parent company didn't exactly love the concept of runaway AI."  Looks like the Terminator franchise left an everlasting impact on the human race.
Luke: A TON of violence and humor. R34 artists: So yes?
Holly shit man poggggers!
I like how the scientists are just like, welp.
I am super impressed with all of the special effects. Tbh, this one of the most incredible thing I have seen all week.
THIS LOOKS SO FUCKING GOOD!
Hype
Bruh the graphics are so good this looks more like a movie though but I'm amazed
The humans: "Guess I'll die🤷‍♂️"
1:09 Was that J K Simmons or was that just me?!?!
It's not meta runner season 3(which I'm hoping is still a thing btw) but this is really awesome and high quality and seeing this kinda reminds me of when my brother showed me madness combat for the first time
To think Luke & Kevin went from parodies about Mario to having a production company producing many great shows is just crazy.  “Keep it up” -Flying Mario head
I can’t wait
OMG IS VERY COLLLLLLD
Looks very interesting and Glitch productions is the best, hey SMG4 and Kevin I also been planning on working at Glitch productions because how awesome you guys are
Great!
The first Glitch productions series that doesn’t feature a single SMG4 character
How long till she shows up in smg4
Violence?
fancy fancy
welp here comes a epic series
Woah! ANOTHER one! This thumbnail looks FIRE! 😲
Um... this sounds nerving to me, I mean I'm nervous, did the humans killed them selves by a KA-BOOM!!!????Or did the whole androids good and bad both did that???
YOOOOO THIS LOOKS SICK BRO I CAN WAIT TO SEE WHAT THIS IS ABOUT
*_DAMN THIS LOOKS LIKE PURE ANIMATION_*
Welp  I bet a lot of artists are gonna create a lot of  art From these characters ^w^
Their first project (besides Ultra Jump Mania) to not star a character previously seen in the main SMG4 series. I love it! ❤
How a spanish stramer says:BUENARDOOOOOO
Yo
You’ve got my attention.
Kinda reminds me of invader zim
Will it be 20 minutes 🤔
YEEEEAAHHH
So basically, Robots built by Extinct Humans discover a secret killer creation that looks exactly like them...   I love it. Can't wait to see more.
Am I the only one who wants to fuck the robots?
I am still wondering if meta runner will have a new season because it ended on a plot twist
This looks sick AF! I’ll definitely watch it when it comes out.  and I hope Meta Runner season 3 is the next big project!
This is perfect for a Netflix movie 🎬
This looks fun.
Woah
Really looks interesting! Looking forward to watching it.
Cringe
I’m in all the way  Zarbon: ooooooh my  Me: WTF Zarbon
LETS GO ANOTHER GLITCH SHOW YEAHHHHHHHH
YES LIAM VICKERS IS AMAZING  (ofc Glitch is amazing too :)
From the creators of Sunset Paradise & Meta Runner.
That looks cool I'm ganna send this to my friend because he likes anime characters and this is the same
It’s amazing how smg4 evolved and how he developed stuff like this
The idea alone is amazing. I'll definitely watch it
Can´t trust the robots alone on a planet? The solution is simple.  Dispatch robots to dispatch them
Can’t wait for extremely obnoxious cliffhangers  Real talk tho, I’m so hyped for this!
I will love this
Bro at this point why isn’t glitch funded by paramount and warner bros this shit is top notch 🤌
I wanted meta Runner season 3! : (
Alright, I’m hyped
This trailer gave me many emotions, some of which im ashamed of, *but we don't have to talk about that*
:)
Just rewatched Internecion Cube yesterday. Damn, that’s coincidental
Omg this looks amazing!
Now this i like
Damn they made the future
Legal
DIOSSSSSSS que felicidad ><¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡
This looks weirdly serious, even for smg4, gonna love that
What a cool trailer, i can't wait to see the show, and can't even wait to see the merch you're gonna make for this show.
the music reminds me of portal
DAame the fucking vizual
This is so cool
Can they eat though?
Get ready for the merchhhh
Holy crap I’m so in
Every show you make is better than the last
Can wait to watch it
Liam is a best person
Interesting I’ll definitely watch the pilot. I’m always a fan of things where there’s a lot of violence. But also cardio development and storytelling and it looks like the show has a big focus on both of those things and I’ll be looking forward to it.
That looks so amazing  I can't wait
YESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYEYSEYSYEYS4YDYEYSYESYESYESEYSEYSEYSYESYESYESEYSEYSEYSYESEYSEYSEYSESYEYAEYSEYSEYSEYSYESYESYEYESYESYESYEYSYESYESYESYESYESYESYES

РЕЗНЯЯЯЯЯ

DIS IS EPICC
Damn this is good
I already know this is gonna be good. The shading, the animating, overall, everything just looks so smooth!

Can't wait
Ohhhhhhh I love this already
This looks like a pretty great TV show. Epic
OMG esto va a ser épico papus
Yooooooo! This looks sick!
Progress is going good
Oo
This looks so goddamn good, this can entertain me until meta runner season 3 comes, I hope 1 team works in that and another works in meta runner season 3
Woah. This looks like it’ll be dark and emotional. This should be fun.
LET'S-A FREAKING GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!
:troll:
Madness combat but robot
Hey glitch, now to be pushy anything but when will Metarunner season 3 trailer drop
This looks even better than sunset paradise!
I can just hear the "Happy Halloween" song in the back of my head while watching this
Looks quite neat, gonna give it a watch
WWWWWWWWWWWWWWWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!! CANT WAIT!!
You mean birds
Give me a whole season plz!
there's there no way in hell glitch made a fully original production
I haven’t watched the latest animation shows you guys have been in the past year, but this looks really good, like REALLY good, so I’m excited to watch the pilot when it comes out
We have been blessed with this content thank you for making this for us glitch
This is Really Interesting 🤔
This should be on streaming channels beside YouTube
Is this a new original series?!
Really hope there will be a character called Penny who will instantly die the moment she's on-screen Let's see who's getting that reference.
Spooky show for the spooky month? PERFECT!
Looks really promising, cant wait!!!
This looks so cool
Looks really epic
plot twist this is how 2021 will end
You know things are beyond screwed when a killer robot has an official designation of "murder drone." The only thing worse than that is "slaughter bot."
So much potential
Very excited! The animation looks amazing!
Now I’m not going to be able to sleep until the 29th
This will be awsome  I can't wait to see the pilot episode
whoa
oooooooooooo
Can’t wait
The visuals are stunning, there's a good idea behind it, the comedy from this snipbit is great, I can tell im gonna love this show
