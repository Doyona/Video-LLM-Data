daryxl dixon is better
Michonne ruins it.
Jadis looks good!
This series is so disappointing. It's 95% dialogue, 3% Rick and Michone making out and 2% action. Prepare to be bored out of your mind
guys can i watch this first without watch Daryl Dixon and dead city series first??
Such a phenomenal actor 👌
I heard rick drew shane on the screen. Where?
Season XXV of the Fast and walking resident dead furious evil.
wanna see this but don't wanna see season 9-11 seasons of the walking dead 🤮
Amateurs....
Really wish this coulda been a movie like they planned, that would have been an EVENT.
1.YEARS 2.GONE 3.BYE 4.WHAT WE 5.BECOME 6. THE LAST TIME  Episodes 1-6.  Meaning as we age we become what we will die as.
Terrible series. Unwatchable.
Should be called walking dead: stupid relationships that destroy civilization.
Tutto molto prevedibile
Twisters 1:47
The Walking Dead is worse than a soap opera. They talk, talk, talk and talk some more.....I was hoping for a change with this but nothing! Black Summer on Netflix is ​​much better! Action and pure adrenaline without chatter. But it was unfortunately interrupted. This is because people want to hear talk, talk and talk some more...
Is this still happening because I promise we’re all waiting still lol patiently in the silence
As a first season this show was okay if a bit rushed... As a stand alone story to end their arc... it sucked.
When is it comeing
0:58 JOHN LOCKE SPOTTED 🏝️
Ayyye John locke babayy
The hand thing was a big mistake. We already have two handless people in the community. This dropped Ricks masculinity multiple points. Any lust I had for Rick faded immediately. But all in all the reunion was great. They still had chemistry and it was entertaining.
This show is STILL going ?
Show sucks big fat ones.  Rick is a sissy whiny peon now.  I hate stupid people, and he's really stupid.  The brave family man Rick of TWD is gone.  I was hoping the show would get better, but it didn't.
Not on Netflix
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥😶😶😶😶😶😶
I wonder if the CRM is still the most powerful organization in TWD after this series ending 🤔
A Perfect Story! I Am Ready For Season 2 💯
this trailer is fire. it should have been the official trailer for the ones who live, it fits so well.
12. Sezon gelecek mii
Holy effing s$$$&@#!
Now that’s a trailer ⭐️
Does anyone know the difference between the soldiers in Black that ricky is with and the other soldiers in white and community the rest of the cast was with and took down?
1.daryl and carol 2.negan and maggie 3.rick and michone Have their own spin off
We want hindi dubbed version all season of the walking dead series
LFG
Turned out to be the worst Spin off out of them all. So Weak... Lazy writing.
Como puedo verla seré en español
What
What
What
I very happy about Rick come back
I want MORE! This show was sooooooo gooood ❤
the writing was awful
A rega ma come si vede in italia????
make more season 😭
movie vibes 😍
Shocked at how good this was
Rick was like fuck this 💥
Wow wow amazing thank you
What the hell that symbol is? Led Zeppelin's John Bonham symbol?
Is this the balance of TWD
Should I cut the chain or should I cut my hand off.  This is why your stock is in the tank.
Rick sure is the heart of this show but I am gonna pick Daryl every time, he makes this season worth watching so far❤️
hows rick alive?
Kurwa kiedy w Polsce będzie
i dont care what anyone says but this series suck compared to the original walking dead, all the spin offs have been disappointments
شت😅
Damn, the creators really did drag this show for another 9 seasons. What a sh*tshow.
We deserve it
Holy fuck i'm goosebumps !!
Weaponize the hell of a good movie or book. Sad way to gain audience.
When will it come in india
Absolutely worst Series in the franchise. The start was great but it gets worse every episode.  1. The whole franchise of Twd and this Series builds up into a great plan of the crm, but apparently the whole secret meting is just: Hey, we kill some people, get there stuff so we can survive. Dude even Negan had better plans with the Saviors.  2. Why does a highly trained military just leave tons of Chemical weapons just chilling in a Tent basically unguarded. That's just stupid beyond imagination, especially when you think about Beales military knowledge.  3. The whole series looks really rushed. I mean apparently one dude can take out so many soldiers? I mean Rick is surely good in what he's doing but come on there are literally the best remaining soldier worldwide an they are taken out by one guy?  4. We don't know what happened after Rick killed the front liners. I was waiting for a final twist, a cliffhanger leaving opportunity for a second season but nothing happens.  My opinion is that they rushed everything way way way too fast and just took the biggest potential villain and flushed it down the toilet. I mean even the Saviors had more screen time than the supposed to be main villains in the franchise. We learn nothing more about what happened in France. This series created high expectations but only gave us like 10% of what we were suspecting. Absolutely disappointing
Just finished watching and it felt good to see Rick and Michonne! We want season 2 pls!
Painfully boring. Rick deserves better.
Can anyone tell me how I could meet Rick in real life?
0:30 believe a little bit longer
Michone one love
Jadis is no longer one of The Ones Who Live. She's now one of The Ones Who Die.
❤
hola director soy un fan the walking dead y he estado viendo todas las temporadas. me gustaria que en la nueva serie no semuera ni michone ni el rick
I hope they build up on the characters and enjoy them a little bit before more drama happens lol... I want to see love again and everyone being happy for a while before another drama. Its like drama over drama lol
I’m so far behind
Good episode. Can't wait for Episode 4
This Rick/Mahone thing is a big NO for me. Loved it in its prime. AMC went streaming to make$$ like all cable BS. Netflix a thousand times better and always relevant 😮
Loved the Walking Dead from the beginning and spinoff. With all the REPEATS on AMC and streaming AMC sucks. They are boring and trying to improve their ratings and revenue.  NOT NOT NO😮
WOW   ALWAYS SAME MUSIC ❤❤❤❤
the best serie  I ve been seen  the walking dead    byt when can we see the 12 season ?❤❤👍👍👍👍👍
My favorite Rick & daryl
I miss Rick
Imagine there's a war between commonwealth army and CRM army
I thought rick died
نزل ❤
Is this for real 😭😭😭
That's why they dropped him on cod's battle pass 😁 noooice
Netflix ?????
We need it on Netflix
A new spin off in the Walking dead series, Can't forget the of Fear TWD last year,Thou' TWD seems to be an endless travia since Morgan left in search of Rick,I got a feeling that all characters may re unite this time including the ones from FTWD,This is gonna be an entertaining series, Can't wait to have Daryl Dixon back. Remember TWD Dead city still has to come back for Series 2 as well as TWD Daryl Dixon 💪 Just love this show together with all the next ones to be released in the future.
The ffirst episode is quite good i hope the following will be in the same level...the last season of the walking dead was SO  BAD ....Please give us something good...
The Quality looks like a major upgrade
I been watching this since the first episode and all the other ones
I love the walking dead. That being said,I found the first forty minutes a little slow.😢
About fucking time
I missed you michonne
*The man, the myth, the legend himself. Has returned*
one more day
too bad they didn’t keep carl huh
❤I think the creators of the series need to remember that according to the constitution, people have individuality, how come I have a backward vision of creativity and the actors have needed rest for about 5 years now, but the people🐒🐒
Welp, I’ll too will be returning. Rick’s back I’m back. We shall see
Most powerful military.   Still walkers, destroyed cities and no civilization.   Great job
This entire series should have ended after the ranch. It was nothing but shit and downhill from there. The the only redeeming quality this show had beyond that point was Negan, and they managed to ruin that character as well. I've never seen such an amazing series destroyed so quickly by horrible writers. We should go on strike against them.
Come baby I'm less than 20 minutes away from witnessing peak!!!!
oh my GODDD
I'm so excited for this.  Finally Rick Grimes is back.
Zzzzzz........  only the first 2 seasons were realistic and tense, 3-5 bearable...  the Rest is like Disney for 16 year old ticktockers
Yeah at this point zombies are just a aggressive/rabid wild animal to them... The real threat was Humans
So excited
is this in Disnet plus?
At the end where michone is smiling thats Rick behind her
Netflix darn it! Get the walking dead now and pay for it pls
Nice movie
Congratulations, it's an excellent movie, I'm looking forward to it
Harika film devam🎉🎉🎉🎉
8m so confused. I cant believe the show is still running. I stopped watching when the Korean guy died in the revolving doors.
Can't wait  for Michonne and Rick!!! ❤💙
Omg. I can barely control myself with the excitement. 😊😊😊😊
return of the prodigal son.
Heeees baaaaaaaack 😩😩😩😤😤😤
I'm soooooo excited!! I was thinking that the history would never be continued :D
We want movie for shane!!
🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
I really hope key members in the CRM orchestrated the zombie outbreak think of how well that would tie the story together, what purpose would releasing the virus even serve? It would eliminate all other government entities meaning they could take full control over the planet’s resources, it would eliminate almost everyone with physical/mental disabilities leaving only the most physically fit and mentally fortified to surivive essentially “culling the herd” which is why in season 8 they ask for “A” and “B” type individuals, those are just my thoughts tho I really hope they write a good story this time around. I was really excited to see Chernobyl in the trailer it makes me think the CRM maybe trying to acquire nuclear material to build hydrogen bombs, which would be an amazing idea draw huge amounts of walkers into a concentrated area and blow it up they could essentially contain the outbreak that way.
I am so HARD right now.
deym to many side story walking dead,it would be better if they connect and still contact each other
Maggie and negan  Rick and shimone Daryl and carol They all will meet at the end
They’re not ready for rick throat biting grimes
I'm tired, Hershel...
Bi hayal gercek oluyor bu film asla unutulmaz❤
THATS MY BIRTHDAY❤❤❤ ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😢❤ ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
"my wife, my daughter" 😂 my man forgot his son LMAO
Everyone believe into an useless Creator for over 3115 years (included both World Wars), that very very long times now, and it causing people's alot mental illness and craziness to believe into some thing that never appear at anytime soon. Believe a bit longer is not an option.
Those CRM solidiers look so f****** badass
Wow
It was so annoying when the characters split up, very happy to see them together again
"People are a resource. I had someone special, I had an A, but I lied and said that he was a B so that he wouldn't end up in your mother's lab. I owed him that much."
No, from one place to the next, Abohut lost his temper, thanks to the director 👎Do you play video games? 🤮
I have chills...
I still can't believe they put Rick in mw3
Getting married and my daughter was born two days ago. So the quote “my wife is my choice my daughter is my choice my life is my choice” hit so hard. I feel so manly when I hear it and I wanna chest bump everyone
Please bring the walking dead hindi dubbed😢😢😢😢😢😢
I love TWD I really appreciate Michone she’s a great  warrior and strong but honestly I don’t like her  as Rick’s lover I escaped when they make love hehe Rick deserve a beautiful leading lady Im sorry 😢
They better not eff this up. I don't think they've ever really respected Rick and Michonne's partnership/love story.
Man Philadelphia looks a bit run down, but hey at least Rick is back
In the entire like 50 season AMC Walking Dead universe there's only been one non-Caucasian bad character with any actual meaningful screentime. In a  continent... North America... That's like only like 60% white, 99% of TWD's antagonists have been white. Why is that?
Is this season 12 . I just finished s11
Rick & michonne is back ❤❤
I think considering the red carpet for towl I believe there's gonna be 3 seasons of this twd spin off, how rick was originally gonna do 3 movies instead a series I reckon this series will be the extended TV series version of what would've been the first movie be same with other seasons if they do that as well
Rick y John Locke. Es un monton😂❤
The goat is back
اشتقنا لكم❤
can't wait OMG
I hope lisa join the series
God i hope they don't eff this up!
Grimes takes on  the most powerful army
اهلا بعودة ريك غرايمز الفخم والرجل الحقيقي ❤
As someone who WAS a huge fan. This was a letdown
I can’t wait ❤
Bro the movies gune be my present my birthday is 24 february bro thats literally my present😊😊😊🥳🥳
No army is a match for Rick Grimes! No matter how powerful you are, if you mess with Rick or his family you will fall before him. Death is what awaits the enemies of Rick Grimes.
😢 we want season 12
The time is nigh ❤
Iam so hyped i cant Wait !!!
Man I haven't watched the show since season 8. However I'm super excited about this
KARL! 🙂 Rick It's so cool that you're back.
This is going to be the best🔥🔥
en sevdiğim dizi hiç bitmesin istiyorum ❤
I'm excited 😊
Rick do want to kill or die?  I wanna do stuff and things
Will it be on netflix?
Will it be on netflix?
I wonder if beale will be parts of other walking dead spin offs i like to see him come across daryl or carol or negan
I stop watching when rick grimes died
Let’s go!!!!!! It’s crazy that we went through our own outbreak in the real world while waiting for this season to come through.
Resident evil walking dead.
Did Michonne say Daryl?
Is ot only gonna be on amc? No disney + nothing?
Is it just me who thinks Giancarlo Esposito will be the final boss
محشر بود این شاهکار 💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼🇮🇷
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I hope I can get back into this show. I lost it for a while now. Too long back
These two don't give a fuck about the kids they left behind in a nuclear wasteland?
Omg the king is coming ...🥹
It's great, thank you, it's beyond perfect
Perfect
I hope they have a new season, they are still a very good show, it makes me cry, they will all get better❤😭😭😭  Ilove walking dead❤
WHO IS IN THE HELMET
Why did he ever leave and ruin the show to begin with? I don't think this will fix anything. Not unless you bring more of the original cast back. John Locke, go back to that Island bro smdh
❤❤❤❤❤
I knew they had to bring Rick back...... I always knew it. I hope he made serious bank on the deal.
Its giving last of us vibes
Ahhhhhhh!!!!!!!!❤❤
These spin offs is the best decision by this franchise till date.
i hope this series is real
Unbelievable thrilled 😮😮
I’ve been saying the walking dead should have done a rogue military faction prob would’ve kept me watching
0:55 "Look at my eyes sir, u tell me"🔥🔥🔥
Lost all interest when I saw Scott Gimple is still involved. Going to be the same ol show like before. Going in circles from one town to another, yada yada. Frank Darabont needs to be brought back in order to save the series, letting him go was the biggest mistake TWD ever made.
Hope it is better than the other spinoffs *yawn
univeral soliders ❤
I'm still not forgiving Rick for leaving show
I love how this is probably all the first episode of the series. I've said it before AMC dont mess this up or it WILL be the last nail in the coffin
Я буду смотреть, однозначно ❤
прикольно! Надо посмотреть
RICK IS THE GOAT!
Vay mükemmel bir film harika merakla bekliyorum
Damn, this looks good. Michonne was always in my top four favorite characters, but I didn't realize how much I actually missed Rick's presence.
Voted up 20 seconds into the trailer
I can't wait for them to find each other again.
Counting down the days!!!!
Did anybody else think that was Viola Davis at first glace in the thumbnail? (And then the next 27 glances after that?) Oh, it was just me? Okay.
Didn’t realize TWD still existed
great. now they have Michonne crying all the time like Rick.
Bring glen back mannnn I miss himmmmmmmm
Havent watched the show for 10 years, so is this like other universe or like going back in time line or is this continution of the last season
Looks good

I just want the brothers to reunite! Daryl and Rick
Can’t wait
when michone make out with rick i decided to unsubscribe to this series, i'm not racist but just weird
Rick has been held in the CRM for longer than he knew any of the group, let that sink in
I'm very happy now, I can't wait
Terrible cgi on that helicopter
I hope they didn’t cut his hand off. That would be just dumb
Hyped!!!
It’s on my birthday❤
Melhor série de todas , mas esticaram de mais já
One handed rick
whats the atlanta bombing shot got to do in here
I remember watching walking dead live in 2011 with the second season and watched every episode live for about 8 years my entire childhood revolved around this show in its prime I love it
Omg I really hope they quench our thirst . Can’t wait !!
Rick grimes
my wife is my .....
People are still watching this show?  This show ended 6-7 years ago
The legend Rick grimes
Red machete>Daryl Dixion>Dead city
Rick's accent has changed? Als kind of weird to have Rick's old man arc before this. Not sure how I feel about this trailer. Allot of the VFX reminds of the first season(where the VFX was pretty bad). I'm nervous. But at the same time this looks like something that was originally meant to be released in theatre's. It has a cinematic feel to it.  Edit: After a second viewing, I think it looks better. I wonder how the all of the main actors of the franchise feel about the current state of the shows/direction of TWD  (Not that anyone cares about my opnion)
Rip ❤ total ! Melhor série do mundo
Imagine a Rick-Shane spin off 😯
Andrew is like guys... i need a paycheck.. time to run it back boys
Rick t amo
quiero ver yaaaa
Finally 🔥
So amc finally bring rick grimes back.. Finally they know twd without rick is a really big mistake..
❤
I thought walking dead finished with season 11
😍😍😍👏👏👏
Heyecanla  yeni sezonu bekliyorum  Rik
I hope they all link up again!!!!. Finally Grimes returns 💪🏾
Judging by the trailer I think rick loses his hand from a burning walker
Can't wait for real😢 TWD...how much I missed this show
So freaking excited!! It feels like I've been waiting a lifetime for this ❤
I left watching after season 9 when rick left but i am back now cant wait
I like rich and michone but im not watching this crap
Rick been eating😂
Terry O'Quinn!!!
Yea!
Rackkk Grimesssss 😍
Maaaaan wait till this comes they bout to break some records...
They're screwing with the wrong people 👀
Okayyyy, i’m back to watching the waling dead again! The goats have returned!! I fell off but super excited for this.
اذا اكون عرب اثبتوا وجودكم بليز 😢🫶❤
Please dubbed in Hindi
i have desperately waited TWD upcoming season more than other show.. middle finger to the makers its took so long..!!FY
i cant keep waiting for this, I hated how the last few seasons played out but we know Rick is alive and I NEED TO SEE HIM AND MICHONNE RECONNECT I NEED TO SEE I CANT KEEP WATING FOR THIS
The only spin off we need or wanted!
Is it in February in 2024. Who knows
2024 starting off really good
We are back baby
Who is soldier they key in on near end??
This is going to be sooo gooood im shitting my pants like Negan says!
Rick & Michonne are the dumbest duo. Michonne is a very boring character
Walking dead really needs to stop..... They are kicking a dead horse
I really missed being a Walking Dead fan....thanks for bringing Rick back to Michonne!
I can’t wait to see Rick killing walkers again!!!!
RICK!!!!!!!!
I thought my love for TWD died when Glenn died, but, there I still see the cast struggling to hold on to live on even if it seems all is lost just like in real life.  Sad that we will never see, old man Carl with a family.
Это будет прекрасно, жду с нетерпением.
Güzel film efektler çok gerçekçi olmuş filmi izlemenizi  tavsiye ederim❤
Bi dizi mi film mi ?
Eskimeyen tek
I missed them, can't wait
I better not have to wait a whole season for them to reunite 😤
00:10 la mujer es la misma del principio? o  cambio de actris?
locke talking to rick, chills
*I only care if I see Daryl and Morgan*
Awesome!!! I can't wait it's going to be EPIC❤❤❤ I have missed Michonne but I have missed Rick so freakin much like OMG😂 He is the beat character in the series imo.
im just hoping they dont go over the top and make everything too unrealistic like the last 6 seasons
I liked this the film its soo good I should everyone see
good to see Ricj & Michonne! IM HYPED!
Bu film süper 🎉🎉
O'Brien, GODDAMMIT! Where's my wife!?

Zombi filmlerinin baş yapıtı, efsane bir yapım.
Çok güzel dizi. Yeni sezonunu heyecanla bekliyorum.
Omg! Is that John Locke from Lost talking to Rick? Are Jack and Kate going to appear as well!?❤❤😊😊😊. I would totally love the new walking dead if they do a crossover with Lost
CANT WAIT
So what happens when this spin off ends? Is this the end of Walking Dead, or will there be a season 2 for one or more of the spin off shows? Or do you need another season of Walking Dead to bring everything together and finally end this?
Twd is saved ‼️😭😭😭
“We could make this whole damn world ours if we want too” BEAUTIFUL WORDS OF MICHONNE YOU THE BEST❤
dmn
Fuck yea!!!
Super HYPED to see the red eye rick again, I hope it doesn't suck like "the Dead City" did.
trash
Oh frickity frack I can't wait. OMG OMG OMG
One more month left! Hurry up!
Do you have to all the walking dead sequels to know what’s going on?
bruh we got John Locke from Lost
Damn I still gotta finish season 9 of TWD wth…lmao
The ending we all deserved from the very first episode, thank you!!
It’s So Many That Didn’t Make it Out They Returned One Last Time 🔥🔥🔥
I'm so Hyped 😊😊😊
Aku tidak melihat tangan kiri rick😢
All we're missing is a Clementine show and we good
How can anyone still be watching this show? If this is what the writers believe life would be like if the world went to hell then it's stupid.I do enjoy the walking dead zombies,which the show is named after.However anything else that is plot,drama and whatever is absolutely boring.I quit watching it years ago and recommend you do the same.
Travis Manawa is COMING BACK!
I haven't heard rick's voice since season 9, he sounds like a completely different person
So ready
Ayo John Lockes there
Im rewatching all the seasons,can't wait for the return of the goat,Rick 🎉❤ !!!
Okay so this comment is a proof that I predicted that morgan Jones will be in the ones who live
For real? There's season 12 coming??
Idk it Looks Not good i love twd
Is it still about zombies?...  😮‍💨
John Locke is a General Beale :O
this movie is insane
Man, I never liked Elizabeth Reaser after her Rebecca role in Grey's Anatomy..
Bad feeling this isn’t going to be worth the wait. Got a bad feeling as soon as it was confirmed it wasn’t going to be a Rick alone show.
We can make this whole damn world ours if we want to. Believe just a little bit longer. We are the ones who live.
If they don't give us a Rick and Daryl reunion Istg I'll die. We. Just. Need. It.
❗️❗️❗️❗️❗️❗️❗️
What the heeeeeeck is happening in here. This trailer is better then last seasons of The Walking Dead. I hope every episode will be like this trailer.
Daryl 🤝 Michonne Looking for Rick
The budget expanded a lot lol. I’m glad! They both deserve a really good spin off and a really good ending to both of their stories. I worked for the show for five years from the end of season six to Covid so I’m so glad that they get to have the ending that they deserve.
I watched the first season of The Walking Dead as people were raving about it and I couldn't understand the hype, I found it boring, contrived and all the characters are stiff, wooden and one dimensional... I wish zombie shows and movies would just DIE already. I really do.
For a sec, I thought that was Viola Davis.
Rick's  first words "my WIFE is my choice..." I yelped! I've missed them so much!
Çok iyi sürekleyici tavsiye ederim başarılı
Ya Allah masih ada film ini..Ceritanya sudah ngk jelas..Bukan manusia lawan zombie lagi..Tapi sesama manusia..FIlm bagus di awal bodoh di akhir
More boring drama, like watching a mix of mad max and all my children, nah ill pass i have better crap to waste my time with.
Please just let the show die
Every time i see rick in this trailer it reminds me of the TWD season 5 version of rick grimes This shows how good andrew lincoln maintain himself all this time
I hope all the characters from the Walking Dead Series return!
YES INDEED ,   BELIEVE A LITTLE BIT LONGER 🫡
is it just me oor Michonne looks like Viola Davis?
Rick comes to Philly 👀👀👀👀
5x5 fear the walking dead:At the end of the episode you see a helicopter similar to those in this spin-off
too many
The suited up person in the end caught my interested, I won’t who that was.
Imagine see rick kills negan or old negan comes back😮
Why do I feel like he becomes a pilot so he can have rendezvous with her, her face at the end just looks like she's reunited with him and he's flying back for some reason.
Eagerly waiting to witness Rick’s resilience and Michonne’s slashing
If only the writers knew how long I’ve been waiting. It’s been forever.
SOLD! !!!!!!!!!!!!
Please bring this and the other shows to the uk
Ходячие мертвецы: Выжившие
WOW!!
At this point they need to stop. 😂
I have such a big smile on my face, Rick made the show for me, Andrew Lincoln is such a phenomenal actor and I can’t wait to see him again.
I love this movie❤❤
The first episode will be 1 hour and 30 minutes long, practically a The Walking Dead movie, as that was their idea in 2018, to make a trilogy of Rick films in CRM. In the end, it became this spin-off series The Ones Who Live.
Gerçekten muhteşem görünüyor
quero ver o rick reencontrando o darly😢

If carlsberg done spinoff twd n power hv smashed it got aswell
SUCH A MASTERPIECE
Okay. Am I the only one who just read I am the one who knocks.
Finley no more curiosity about rick in last season was totally  shit and I started this series because of rick
I just want the show to make sense ... the way it made sense before season 6.
Rick grimes
nobody cares about this dead series anymore, it’s been garbage since day 1
I can't believe this show is still running. I've grown old already waiting for the end. Lol 😂 PS. I stopped at season 3 or 4. Can't even remember.
How many times have you watched this? Me: yes
Wait, is that Maze? 😮
Is this the ship that was on Tales of the Walking dead, where Alpha/Dee and Lydia were ?
Should have kept Rick in the regular show and then made like a 5 hour movie. These spinoffs are silly. They ruined the regular show which I was obsessed with but now I don’t even care lol.
where the fuck is negan?
We are the ones who live to see the goat’s return
Looks good, I just don't like Michonne.
CANT FN WAIT!
Dead City and this is the only reason I'm watching anything TWD.
I think amc should show full episodes of the walking dead all seasons
Rip to anyone in the U.K we won’t be getting this anytime soon.
Welcome back Rick ❤
Cant wait
omg thank you amc for not leaving us hanging
0:39 🤮
I need Madison Clark to meet Rick now
I stopped watching twd when Andrew Lincoln left the show, this looks promising and I should probably continue watching twd again
YES the only reason I stuck with the walking dead for so long is BACK BABY!!!
Can't help but feel excited for this and a bit emotional. It's been a long time coming
when will it come out?
neat!
Wow..
Yesssss 🙌
Looks like we’re gonna maybe get some insight on what happened in Atlanta because the was a clip from when they were dropping napalm on the city!!!
AAAAAAAA AŞKLARİM GERİ DÖNDÜÜÜ HEYECANLA BEKLİYORUMMMM
Did Rick just say “My wife is my choice.” ? He and Michonne are not married, though they deserve to be.
CRM: has tens of thousands of elite soldiers + special forces rick: "i have a hatchet with your name on it"
SOOOOO EXCITED for RICHONNE
Woah. This looks lit
I cannot wait! This show releases 1 day before my birthday also!
Readyyy
John Lock!
Nice To know he hasn't forgotten his daughter
Трейлер похож наблокбастер и выглядит многообещающе
John Lock should've stayed on that island
Can't wait 😪😪
I have to see them all reunite
Is this the season 12?
How I love this universe! But I cried over Lee's death. 😭
Saving the best for last.
YES! YES! YES! ❤
Does the phone that michonne was holding was available in 2010 because as far as I know the time-line of the apocalypse started in 2010 so everything stopped how could they have advanced stuff if the world stopped in 2010 I hate when they are not accurate to the time line of the story
Ultimate goat is comming Babe
Rick is baaaack!!
WHEN TF CAN WE HAVE THE SERIES IN ITALY????? WE STILL WAIT FOR DEAD CITY AND DARYL!!!!
Its cool but please no more stormtrooper shit
i saw like taqa in    fear the walking dead
I can’t wait for this!
bro I got goosebumps 🥲
HO LEE SHITTTT!!! I am sooooo excited for this. As a die hard TWD fan I am so happy that this was just released. 🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻
I really need to find some friends to survive with please join my survival group.
もう少し信じてみて Believe a little more
I’m assuming lots of this series was made using footage from what was going to be the Rick trilogy movies cause this trailer looks so damn good
I wonder if rick and beale will fight
I haven’t watched walking dead or any of the spin offs in years but I may have to check this one out
So in the show's arc, the commonwealth is just a red herring for the CRM
this looks dumb, lol. the dialouge is cheesy lol
They’re BACK!!’ Oh how I’ve missed you two
Did anyone notice rick grimes standing in line with the crm soldiers look closely at :53
Hasta que volvió el Comisario 😊🎉👏👏👏👏
This show is looking epic ❤
I hope it will soon come to Netflix because AMC is not available in India
Pretty hype trailer for a show nobody has any interest in anymore
Damnnnn!!!!
With the other spinn offs you feel a connection to twd.This is completely different. It feels like this is a show that belongs to its own.They can't just make it one season
I actually cannot WAIT. February 25th cannot come fast enough!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
😭😭😭🙏tears of joy🥲
TWD LOST TWINPEAKS GOT XFILES
This surely looks amazing. And I stopped the video in the moment when this old guy general sort of asks rick that if he wants to kill and i saw that Rick doesnt have a left hand,but a sort of a blade. I REALLY want to see how its gonna go with this more accurate version to comics(of course if im not wrong).
Better see some evolved zombies
A bunch of fake fans In the comments. Many of them probably bailed after Glen died.  Myself... I took the ride from beginning to end every single season, and enjoyed it. I was teary eyed ALOT and I CHEERED ALOT. The bond I have with this show can't be explained.
This seems so unreal from a man looking for his family to this
defo looses his hand
Something tells me Rick will not be the focus....
*I see Rick Grimes demoralizing CRM by publicly Assassinating Beale.* 😈  It’s looking like the natural born leader, is gonna’ have to make some allies & get to work. The only way he escapes is by using citizen uproar & a rebellion to his advantage. This 10-Year Oversight on that newspaper, is the perfect opportunity to rally the people.   They’re the Ones Who Live.  They’ll figure it out.
We need Rick, his wife and Daryl, to met again and go home!!!!
Who else thought this would never happen and is so damn glad it is?!?!?
Frank: I’m not the one that dies, I’m the one that does the killing  TWD: We’re the ones who live to do the killing
I would like to see rick and negan together after all of this.
cant waittttttt
Does anyone else want Daryl and Rick to be reunited more than they want Michonne and Rick reunited?
1M views for the finale is not okey. Another future flop
The production quality and cinematography look the best of any TWD yet!
I love year ok,😊🙃👍💓
They ain’t ready for the army back home tho cause they would be dead
Fucking love psycho Rick against the Nazis ...
Va a estar en Netflix?
SLAY SLAY SLAY SLAY im LIVING for this im gonna frickin CRY this is amazing 😭🥰
Can't wait ❤
Please don’t ruin this show like the past 5 before it
Interesting this year I started watching twd. I'm on. Season 4 almost season 5.
Yuhhhhhh
The fans who watched every Sunday like myself are so stoked! This gives me goosebumps. NUMBER 1 TV SHOW ON THE PLANET HANDS DOWN
I loved A World Beyond. I can’t wait for this.
I CAN'T WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIIIIIITTTTTT
NÃO CHORE , EMBREVE OS RICOS SERÃO EXTERMINADOS 😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎
1:13 why did the reuse the scene from the Atlanta bombing in season 2?
mehhhh
Can’t wait yessss
Dead sity is better for me.megan and nigan..all 6 episode action.deryl show litte boring but beacose love deryl in this series ok 😁
The needs to come to the movies
This is amazing
I hope they get together again sooner rather than later, so we don't have to wait another several years 🤣
Military actually being used and shown to be an actual military now? No shot they finally did something right
I kinda hope Rick becomes a crm loyalist and takes them over it would be cool seeing a militaristic Rick grimes
I'm so happy to see Rick back to the game.FUKC YEAAA !
Is it worth watching the walking dead I stop at season 5
WHOOOOHOOO! Can't wait! This will be EPIC! #bigfanfromHolland
Defiantly Darl at the end
My boy Rick is back bitches!! Hell yea!!🎉🎉
I’m so glad the changed the CRM outfits they look way better now
You can see Rick in the warehouse shot as a soldier. 2nd row near the middle.
Fuck yess
Rick please ask locke about the god damn numbers.
Beautiful
pc
Lol for a second there I though "This is the most powerful military in the world"  was said by Tony from gold rush 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
They look like a watered down Umbrella Corp. lol
ok IM HYPE AGAIN with this series. DAMN what a trailer
Why don't the hoards ever have walkers that were kids before turning?
Rick nem lembra mais do seu melhor amigo Shane😅
Name of the song or ost?!?😢
Дождались бляха муха!!!!!!😢🎉❤
I'm too burnt out to spend time on anything that's not exceptional from beginning to end. If we get early series quality let me know.
Rick and Daryl need a reunion
1:38 I know that walk from anywhere you ain’t fooling me amc 🤠
Yawn... Does anyone care anymore? You've flooded us with characters we don't really care about and removed the ones we liked. I don't care about Maggy. You'll be hard pressed to see anyone who cares about Maggy. You've replaced every decent straight guy except Darryl with woman. THEIR ALL DEAD OR have become PATHETIC .  although this looks good lol
Is this going to be on Netflix?
Sacen por favor en español latino THE WALKING DEAD UNIVERSAL PLIZ
🤨
Я давно смотрел этот сериал, остановился на моменте, где они в каком то лагере, и там у мужиика еще тигр был ручной, это в каком сезоне было?
Missed Ricky.
This looks so good I hope that the writers and directions gave it their everything and it comes out a genuine masterpiece❤
song please ?
This looks SO GOOD! I’m so excited!!
i cant wait. am so excited
Ураааа!
RICKY G 🗣️🗣️🗣️
Ive been so ready since forever for Rich and Michonne to come back!!! Ive been a TWD fan since Day 1!!!! ❤
Omg!!!! this looks amazing!!! can'ty wait!!!wow!!!
Andrew Lincoln and Terry O'Quinn is a guarantee of success for the new series!!!!
Rick's voice getting diferent
movie level
Looks like at the 1 minute mark Rick’s left hand is missing
cant wait
legendary characters❤
What is the theme 🔥🔥🔥
Will Daryl Dixon be in The Ones Who Live?
King Bong 🦍
gives us the whole trailer! please 😭
My mom is obssesed with the WD and the was very upset with the ending. I just showed her this trailer and she said "it's the best Christmas gift i've received!"...Sooo thanks WD, you've helped me a lot! She's so excited! 😃
You can see rick grimes on row 2 soldiers at crm
This is gonna be amazing. So nice that TWD is getting back to where it should never have gotten from.
Ughhhhhh this has been going on for so long i just wanna see where the zeds began and my banana stops
cnt wait till he finds out about rick jr
Im hyped man
Shout out to all the loyal TWD fans. We really deserve this show after all these while.
I USED TO PRAY FOR TIMES LIKE THIS
What's with this stupid franchise ? All of a sudden they have apaches and missiles 😂 ?? Those zombies are still kicking after what 15 years ??😂
That first chord of the soundtrack. Goblin. Dawn of the Dead. Fran and  Peter. The ones that lived
릭 과 미숀의 만남이라 ^-^
Jesus this show just won’t go away
Finally!
I’m gonna laugh if they manage to mess this up…
1:26 giving the Shrek look 😂😂
I hope it’s AT LEAST a 2 hour premiere!!
JOHN LOCK JOHN LOCK
You cant have anything say The Walking Dead without Rick Grimes. Original OG that made the series
Guys plz answear me is there coming a new Season??? Plz someone?
Junk
IS THAT MAZIKEEN
Негров маловато
One thing that's been bothering me for a few YEARS now and I've never seen asked or explained is both Negan and Gabriel had  encounters with Jadis and a  CRM helicopter. Why is it neither of them EVER mentioned this to ANYONE? Also, during their search for weapons Rick and Michonne( my least favorite character by far) found the huge stash of weapons AND pallets of MRE's and canned goods etc. The van they were driving wasn't big enough to haul even 1 of the MRE pallets so there's still pallets of the stuff sitting wherever they were, yet during the 8 yr war with the saviors people are going hungry. And if all the food and weapons were still at these fair/carnival, somewhere are the trucks that haul the rides, and a parking lot full of fairgoers vehicles with fuel and whatever to be scavenged. Did Rick AND Michonne just forget? Did I miss something? Someone please explain it to me.
this is some real american type trailer xD
Same old tired story, plot points, boomerang story telling filled with political correctness. No sense of community or intrigue like when TWD first started out. All of these spin-offs still only milking the franchise; what a sad time for the entertainment industry.
Stopped watching around the all out war storyline.  Show peaked with Terminus ...and it was an amazing peak.  This actually looks rad though
While the other spinoffs had their moments, I truly believe that this show is going to really be amazing. I really hope it's multiple episodes before they reconnect again. I wouldn't be upset if they don't reconnect this season. Show their stories. You can fill a season with just that.
damn i cant believe i am going back to this show after i left because glenn died
I can't wait to seem him and negan reunite
Just let it go.
Yes baby Rick Grimes is back
this trailer is so good i wathed it like 30 times already
cant wait this might be my return to the walking dead!!!
This feels like Michonne vs Rick, leading to Saving Rick and then Rick and Michonne bringing down the CRM
Is that Rick in the last shot as a crm soldier?
We all know whats gonna happen. Rick is going to die.
In every scene I've seen of this trailer I only see Rick's right hand if a hand at all. I'm almost positive they're cutting off Rick's hand bringing comic accuracy. Even as Rick uses the spear he grips it with his right hand and braces it on his left forearm. Call it what you will but...❤
WHAT A SHIT????, " DIXON", ETC ?? 😎
Everyone I know from the good ol'days is coming back for Rick, lets gooooo
I LOVEE THIS! Can’t wait!
Can anyone explain how rick is still alive , I saw in season 9 that he was dead on that bridge than how he is still alive??
0:39 wtf is the voice
Realising date
❤️ 🔥 ❤️
Wow ini sangat kita tunggu  Berharap rick kembali kepada grupnya
Michonne, RIck AND John Locke as a military Colonel... I'm 1000% ready for this!
JOHN LOCKE will be there!!!!
😍
OMG, I CAN'T WAIT
I not ready for this! 🥺🥺 Rick and Michone!❤❤🎉🎉
Naaaah they will F**** d up the story.
Hearing Rick literally gave me goosebumps!!!
I think side-story chapters are better than OG TWD.
So this is supposed to take place a little bit after the series finale of the main series and before the events of Dead City. Would that mean that Rick and Michonne wouldn't meet up with the rest of the groups after six years?
please make hindi dubbed the walking dead all series
please make hindi dubbed the walking dead all series
please make hindi dubbed the walking dead all series
🍑🔥🍑🔥
Forza e coraggio 💪
Bravi
Listen to me : no man is gonna be man enough to be Rick Grimes❤
ok now we talking
What's up Rick!! Been a long time buddy.. stopped watching after the 10th season because the writing was so trash, but I'm here for a Rick & Daryl reunion.. even if they did screw up writing Daryl's character in that spin-off show and turned him into something he's not..
Wow amazing movie ever
WTF IS JOHN DOING THERE
well...time to rewatch the series
AMSHE 😂😂😂😂 just like MSHEU 😂😂😂
Really again
lol too little to late the walking dead has become litterlay the walkin dead
But how tf are there this many zombies left? Like at this point, their bodies probably would’ve decayed to a point that they can’t even move.
J
🔥
Wait what????
omfg, LESLIE-ANN BRANDT'S HERE TOO?! 0:47
0:13 something about those eyes. (very chilling, and i love it. 😰)
are they still dragging this story? sheshhhhhhh.........
So the ones who live spend their lives killing each other
A token of me steem, I'll make Michonne a bride to be.
He will come back as trans non binary man who will cancel all zombies
They got cell phones back?? Wtf? Seems as ridiculous as daryl floating across the ocean to paris!! Lol they need to just stop, it was great, just let it go now! Please!
Please make this good! Dixon spin-off and others suck major balls!
You know when rick is being obedient he has a masterplan in the works.
please stop
I hope it’s not BORING.
Wowwwwwwwww😮
Looks like John Locke did make it off the island
Still don’t understand how there is so many zombies after all this time
Feminist movement 😢
Rick was officer friendly, now he's CRM soldier unfriendly.. imagine. I think after all that he will find his self again I hope. Anyway I can't wait for badass rick grimes!
Now That's what i am talking About. Great Now I want atleast 6 Seasons in 2024
Feb 25th is so far away.. I couldn't wait for it... waiting for Rick & Michonne..❤
Rickkkkkkk❤
S12❤?
Loco por ver la continuación después de  fuera el último ke se finaliso  gracias😅
Looks okay but like something out of marvel, it doesn’t feel like the walking dead… it doesn’t give me that same vibe
Essa atriz que faz a Michone é muito boa. Tem que aproveitar ela no máximo em vários papéis. Ela poderia muito fazer algum papel principal no Mcu.
Wow, sir john locke, long time no see, or were you really "lost"? 😊
/yawn  Who is even concerned about this franchise any more?
Ujuu😊😊😊
No you can not
I saw Maze! Goodluck Walkers
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Can’t be worse than Fear the walking dead
It's time to reassemble bois
I just want to see Rick and Daryl together again. fuck the lovey dovey storyline I wanna see the brothers embrace
Damn
this is gonna be good twd died after rick left
TWD is a master piece ❤
Is this a moviE
OH MY GHAD THEYRE ALL BACK HUHUHU
Last season
rick ağabey sensiz olmuyordu be
Why is that man's voice so thin?
Can't believe John Lock outlived a plane disaster and paranormal island just to end up having to deal with a zombie apocalypse
TWD yang sekarang tidak menegangkan seperti dulu 😞😞😞
tf is that voice????????
My uncles favorite characters he died recently 😢
Love it to see the Raging Rick again. I love that Andrew still nailed it❤
for me rick is the heart of the show.. glad he's back.. i hope this gonna be a great series like it used to be.. cant wait!!
I hope to see Morgan, you just have to have Morgan and Rick reunite one last time.
WHAAAAAAATT?!?!
I don't know why i stop watching it when enid die 😢
This is what The Walking Dead fans have been waiting for.
Can't wait!!!!!
is it movie or series?
"Do you wanna kill, or do you wanna die?"  "Yes." 😂😂
passionate
This video is very good and veri interesting
That scene with the helicopters bombing the city looks like the same scene in season 2 episode 5 when Shane same the group saw the city getting napalmed
Honestly i got burned out ive only seen seasons 1-8
Please release in india we are waiting for rick returns
Wow Locke still looks really good
In confused, they made rick old & now hes young?
Can't wait to see Rick Grimes back!
Rick🔥
LOOKS LIKE MARVEL VERY CRINGE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
JUST finished the whole series finally 😂 im so stoked to see what comes next !!!
None of the spin-offs have aired here in the UK yet. What's going on?
2e film Amazon pourquoi ne pas sortir du Béni
It is just me who miss the ambience of Walking dead before cuz the scenery now is like more in CGI
It's a shame we'll  never see him and Darryl reunite
LOSTのジョンロックが出てる！
На конец то 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
My life will finally be completed
bro that finna be my birthday present release
FINALLY OUR RICK GRIMES IS BACK ON THE SERIES, THIS RICK FROM THE TRAILER IS LOOKING MORE LIKE RICK FROM SEASON 5. DOES ANYONE AGREE WITH ME?
Мой любимый сериал!
RICHONNE IS BACK 🥹🥹🩷🩷
Finally something interesting, how military force developed in that world. Can't wait
0:57 THATS JOHN LOCKE!!!
watching this just for Rick
OH MY FUCKIN GOD.......................Rick & John Lock... HELP
The fact that Dania is the creator and writer; that’s what really makes me hype for this. I KNOW it’s going to come from the heart and be absolutely killer. Ending the main show and giving us these spin offs was a wise choice — I’ve enjoyed them all so far.
Hy even Jadis is in this series
I am very anxious
To be honest I didn't expect John Locke in TWD universe.. I'm hyped even more than I was before!
this is a movie or a serie?
you know this looks good. i gave up on twd maybe around season 6, but i may pick this up again.
Finally ! Return of legend.
SHAME IS NOT AVAILABLE IN THE UK ⛔️⚠️🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿⛔️⚠️….   They WILL have the REAL THING THEN…. 🤣⚠️⛔️🔥….!!!!..   REVELACIÓN: 7,11,14 & 19!.
Michonne 🤎
Anjir si rick is back
Fn GOOSEBUMPS Omg I really can't wait. Ahhhh!
빨리 개봉해줘!
So glad they didnt kill of Rick in S8. Hope we get Season 5 Rick back and a Rick and Daryl reunion but its s shame its only 6 episodes
Holy shit
1080p in 2024 ? You're kidding right
Terry O'Quinn is such a phenomenal actor. Glad he is on this show and hope that they use him well.
The Walking Dead meets Michael Bay. Series died after season 4 and was only shortly great in season 7.
Darryl will swim back to the US if he knows Rick is alive…
WTF is going on hereeee, someone watched "the last of us" and got some ideas all right 😂😂😂
The most freaky part is that Danai Gurira looks more and more like Viola Davies
best tv couple <3 can't wait to see my parents
this is either gonna be the most epic serires or the most disappointing one
I’m actually down to see this
Eyes 💥💥💥💥💥
I'm sorry but I used to love this show. Stopped watching right when Rick blew the bridge. Dont know the plot or characters anymore and stopped caring
THIS IS RICK GRIMES!!
Yep... when your viewership numbers are dwindling, it's time to resort to necromancy. Truly inspiring...
Welcome back
Omg yessss
AMC, don't take your hand off Rick Grimes, it will end the series, if you continue with this idea, the end of Rick Grimes for me was in the last episode of twd. Listen to a fan's concern
अब बस भी करो
Dead people are not god thay can't live so long......
I loved the series but a hate we had to whait so long even so long it feals not relevent any more:/
Rick!!!!
Soooo excited❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥🥹
We want Travis Manawa back!
I hope this is the end of the saga
About bloody time!!  I've been waiting forever. I've moved house, had a baby and been in my job 5 years since Rick vanished. Whooohooooo😂
Now there'll be hundreds of thousands of fans whole get that Japanese saying tatted on them... "Believe a little bit longer".   I APPROVE!!!!
They already screw this universe, another series just proves it.
The person in the blacked out helmet is gonna be a walker solider I bet
John Locke!
Finally
TWD HYPE TWD HYPE looks sick
I think it's gonna be much better than the Dixon serie
I hope Michonne is not gonna cry in every episode
So she goes looking for him at the end of the walking dead ?
жевсть, до мурашек, графика и эффекты так изменились, здорово выглядит
I'm giving this a dislike for 1 thing and one thing only. Why do they straight up REFUSE to mention RJ? Hardly any lines, or screen time..all he had to do was pick up Rick's gun, point it at a zombie just like Rick did and shoot..screen fades to black and credits roll..they can't even do that.
She’s the best!
Wow! Aqui Rick si que parece un verdadero HOMBRE 🤣, porque todo lo que ví de él antes, fué que era una nenaza.😒
Yessssssssss ahhhhh yessssssssssssssssss I am I new fan glad I got here and everything wasn’t over yet 🥹🥹
Just finished TWD I’m glad I got here in time I watched it this whole month and December I cried alot I should’ve watched it years ago the season 11 ending was incredible👏👏👏👏👏
that scene with all the helicopters going over atlanta is from season 1!
What an absolute joke
Never watched another episode after Negan killed Ben+Abraham,,,,THE best episode ever,,ever...AMC don't deserve this to win,,after killing Carl off...Dump ass..
Can't wait ❤❤❤❤❤
Sonra herkes yanyana gelince te walking deadın devamı gelsin
Damn. 💥💥💥💥💥
I'm actually re-watching the entire series to get a better feel of these new shows they have coming out. Even Fear the Walking Dead as well...
Even in a fake post-apocaliptic world... Black Love no longer exists 😢
OMG John locke is here ❤❤❤
*looks good but over the top*
this spin off is gonna be fure🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Compared to Black Summer…🥱
Best series
Finally,  what we have been waiting for!! This literally made my day!!
00:39. What the hell is that
It’s hard to imagine anyone else in love with TWD more than me…….. With that,   Does anyone really care about this universe anymore?
Is thet a Souf Efrican eccent.?
Who the hell’s is the dude w the beard and high pitch voice?
Pleaae i implore ya'all dont make it commie like u did twd's last season,like,why politics,u guys just have to ruin things
The craziest thing we got from this trailer was the reveal that the CRM were actually behind the bombing of Atlanta and presumably other cities right as the world began to end.
Oh lord
👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Would like to say thanks amc the wait is worth it the goats back….we’re the ones who waited 6 years but its time🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Its timee🤧🔥
This and Daryl  dixon got me rehooked on the franchise.  Fear and world beyond lost me
They milking this show for years...just let it die. 😵
I wonder if this time they will stick to their own rules. Guts avoid zombies, armless zombies deter other zombies, cutting jaws off passing the zombies.   The son he’s in walking dead should be zero threat to anyone.
God god this pile of shit show is still going? INSANE
OKAAAYYYY LETS GOOOOOO
THE ZOMBIES ARE MORE REALISTIC THAN THE DEMOGRAPHIC.More Lefty grueming.
OMG end the fucking series
Jesus christ have they made enough of these spin offs? Like seriously, they are milking this so bad
2much is 2much. let this series go
Muito pika
Wow that sounded like Alicia talking to michonne.!! Neways I can't wait for this!!!🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉❤
I think we’re going to see a movie(s) with all survivors (fear / walking dead / world beyond) leading into a new series.
Please make it stop!
I wonder who that was at the end 🤔
This show should’ve died 10 seasons ago
I stopped watching when Glen died I gotta start back up this actually looks good
I don't understand why they cant wipe out the zombies..
Can't wait!
AYEEEE YOOO WHY DIDN’t HE SAY HIS SON RJ?!
Nah Rick is so cold bro I’ve missed it
The King Return
This looks like its gonna be Amazing - i cannot wait until they dee each other face to face - its gonna be powerful !
You don’t know when to stop, do you guys? I’ll rewatch seasons 1-3.
Wow great graphics
I can’t wait
Im waiting ❤❤❤
Out of all the spin offs, this is the one
Been waiting for Rick’s return. Glad he’s back.
why end the series just to make 3 spinoffs i dont understand.
Who's ready to Rick ISH UP!!!
Is this going to be a one season show? I hope it’s more to show what Rick has been doing for so long.
Oha John Locke!
IS THIS FKING JOHN LOCKE?
I thought we were getting a movie.
When will the series be shown in which month?
Its on baby I'm here for the love of these two 😍😅😅😍😅😅!!!!!
Through all the shit we had to go through (yes you stormtroopers) we finally get an act of reward.
I am so so so excited for this. Watched the trailer twice.
This is the best TV series of all times
Man I wish Carl was still alive
AMC took "Walking Dead" to a whole new level...  They are unwilling to let it die!!! And indeed, shows keep coming back in rotten ways like Zombies do!!!  At least they stray true to the plots!  I do enjoy this shows, when it's about Survival. But then it turned into Savage & Barbaric Show that are all about how Cruel People can be, rather than how Productive & How Resilience People can be.  This displayed with a Drastic Different between Walking Dead & The Last of Us 2, that Maria's ranch was turned into safe heaven with Community & Electricity & Became a Town/City by itself.  But all WD can do, it became more deranged & degenerate & devalue human's nature bits by bits! Best they can do, is to turn a scared lady like Carol into a Soulless Killing Machine who would massacre a whole town by herself and feel nothing about it & go on about her day as if nothing happened!  And turned Rick into a Deranged Man that no longer aware where the line between Good & Evil lies anymore.
Cant wait untill it comes
Pretty hilarious- i thought they would end the walking dead. All they did was split it up into 5+ different shows
Too much wait
Oh my god , Jhon Lock!!!!
0:57  John Locke is alive in the walking dead universe!!!!
Yes yes yes
Lol the abbreviation is TOWL
Great, I’m sure the bearded lady is really going to add to the story… definitely she won’t take away from it by being too distracting and bizarre for this world where she wouldn’t exist AT ALL 🤡
متى يبدا هذا المسلسل
an altenative universe that rick and daryl meets again
CHILLLLLLS🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Fabuła filmu została udziwniona na maxa w pewnym momencie. Ten obraz miał potencjał, ale są tam już w tej chwili same absurdy. Człowieka może pokonać albo coś co jest od niego mądrzejsze, albo coś fizycznie silniejsze. Żywe trupy nie mają ani jednego, ani drugiego. To raz. Dwa. Mentalność ludzka jest taka, że łączy się przeciwko wspólnemu wrogowi. Nieważne gdy prowadzisz wojnę pa ataku na pear harbor czy jesteś demokratą, czy republikaninem, wrogiem jest Japonia. Tymczasem tutaj mamy nawalanke ludzką, a zombi prawdziwy wróg są tłem. To niepoważne. Głupie po prostu. Ilość głupot w serialu jest powalająca (w zamknietych społecznościach np królestwie obowiązywałoby zamykaniem się wszystkich na noc, aby jeden zmarły w nocy nie zagryzł pozostałych). No same bzdury po prostu.
Como puedo ver si no tengo amc?
This was the only show to ever have me and my big huge family sit down on Sundays together and talking dead, now nobody watches anymore but I do like to keep up and want to rewatch all of this together again
Eu TB estou com saudades do Rick gostaria de saber se vai passar na Netflix ou na Praime Vídeo começando da décima primeira temporada? Alguém poderia me responder por favor?
This aint even the walking dead no more.....
One of the best and most beautiful series
Are we ever going to be able to see these in the UK?
Yesssssss!!!!!!!!!!!
Can`t wait to miss it looks a yawnfest...
Я надеюсь они всех героев из всех сер алов этой вселенной объеденят в одну, прям не терпится увидеть как они все вместе мочат врагов
hello, i am not caught up on TWD, how did the bring rick back if he died on the bridge?
???「little pig little pig let me in」
Rick has lost basically everything, he lives to kill the undead now, his humanity has left him, hopefully when Michonne finds him, he will find his humanity again!    Welcome back Rick!
Gurss  I'll be steaming AMC too 😊🎉
Wow, looks like utter drawn out bordom. Rip walking dead.
OMG♥️😭😭😭😭
1:12 Is that CRM helicopter arriving CommonWealth?
Damn... this is gonna be so good!!
Why i have feeling that Rick will die at the end of show? Is it just me or is it twd's actual way to kill characters
gonna be shane  1:39 heard they wanna bring  shane  back perfect way for shane to come back
Really pushing that interracial thing
Waiting this like gta vi
WOW RICK IS BACK AFTER SO LONG?!!! I stopped  watching twd at season 10 . Finally some exciting news for walking dead fans  ❤‍🔥
Этот трейлер вызвал у меня эйфорию, я ожидаю этот сериал больше чем выход чего либо ещё.
Thats what we need, another crappy spinoff
Setiap adegan filem setelah rick ngk ada serasa hambar😣😣
❤
Friendly reminder the same writers left Daryl in France to stay with a 10 year old boy he just met. This whole franchise is washed.
Who even cares about Michone
Граймс граймс граймс жолго тебя ждали
At 1:41, is that a zombie in that soldier suit?
Maybe enough????????
Waiting hindi version
is he in canada ?
OMG Its so CRAZY
Im calling it now rick gets bit by a walker then gets his left arm chopped off. Cuz it looks like he has a weapon as his left arm there's definitely no hand there
LeMEa Teelll uuu SOMEthiG their wakas in THEEEee WOOOOooDs🕺
Is Rick basically turning into Gerry lane from world war z?
No ones gonna talk about how this is where John Locke ended up?
the END coming
When it will releasing in Netflix??
I need Daryl to find Rick
Michonne, Rick and John Lock return
Looks good #TheOneWhoLives
Well they definitely spend most money on producing the show, I cannot wait.
The Walking Dead: Return of the King
Is this season 12
I'VE BEEN WAITING SO DAMN LONG FOR THIS I CAN'T EVEN BELIEVE IT'S HERE ALREADY AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Now how tf they all of sudden get a military in this series
Ese es mi Ricky Dicky Doo Dah Grimes let's gooo🤠
Rick is BACK !
I’m excited but the walking dead just doesn’t have the same vibe anymore. It used to be almost relatable, like what it would actually feel like if there was a zombie apocalypse. But now it’s more of a drama and I miss the old twd
1:48 coldest line I ever heard
IM SO READY FOR THIS!!
💙
The third walking dead spinoff
WOW!!!!!
Fuckin dope! Slick Rick is back 💀
John lock ❤️
I’ll renew my subscription as soon as this is ready     If I’m still here
Will it be shown in Netflix?
Feb 25 can’t get here any faster
“Look in my eyes, sir. You tell me.” Thirteen years of loss, anger, pain, and determination in those eyes. He’s come a long way from officer friendly. It’s good to see you back, Rick.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
🔥🔥🔥🔥 looks amazing
RICKKK
BUT WHY? JUST LET IT DIE.
Where’s Daryl
Crap from day1😂😂😂
This looks good
Omgggggg RICHONEEE. this series looks so different tho like i miss the old walkers and story lines. It’s more war like now
amazing
Michonne is wearing all the things she wore in TWD 11:24 ending scenes.   She got her clothing and horse from the group she left with in her last episode.    My theory is that Rick becomes a member of the CRM or their smaller elite forces.
Cool,, rick grimes come back
The GOAT and John Locke. This is going to be good.
I'm so happy I'm not the only one whose excited!!❤❤
0:26 That way of Rick sitting down with his back against the wall and that look in his face and eyes; I always remember him like that from S4 E16 when he bit Joe's neck and killed him and sat down like that and Daryl next to him.
Muito ansiosaaaaaa❤❤❤ tomara que Rick e Judith se reencontram 😢❤
calling it now.  They gunna pull a level of I am legend type growing intelegence in the infected maybe some varients are more aware or can divert hordes .  Hence why we are seeing this level of combat---im here for it xD
I really hope they make it about Rick, Michonne is such blah.
It seems that the CRM is still using the gas used on the Campus Colony and Omaha. Their mass genocide campaign continues but they are going to make a lot of enemies.
Too much Michonne but ok
🔥🙏🏿
Finally! Rick returns, cannot wait.
Rick didn't know Michonne was pregnant before did he??
Nah. Not into this with all the military stuff.🤠💕
Wow! Nem acredito!! Será épico!!
Michone looks like Viola Davis in the thumbnail
Honestly, I wish at least a little bit of it went back to old sherrif Rick on a horse in a dead dilapidated city trying to still do the right thing.
I hope Rick will meet Judith and his second son RJ
I haven't been this excited for a show in a very long time. This looks amazing!
John from Lost
Well its about fooking time AMC!!!!!!!
They waited tooooo long to give us Rick back that I'm not longer interested/care.
Will it be on disney plus?
rick lost his left hand 1:01
Didn't Rick die?
I could definitely leave my two young children and go find my dead wife gotta love the walking dead writers. My guess is that michone goes to Girl Boss 2.0, and we barely see rick do anything but cry😂
Who is that solider at ending ? I see a mutant walker
Bruhhhhhhh😭😭😭😭🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Took way to long to bring the bad ass show
0:06  LOOK AT THAT BIG ASS ZOMBIE I remember when michoone had to walkers following her
YASSSSS YASSSS YASSSS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Scream !!!!!
After hearing so much about The Walking Dead series from my co-workers, I finally gave in and watched one episode, which I believe was the second episode of the second season...needless to say, I stayed hooked mainly because of Rick, Andrew's character, he was so convincing, not to mention, easy on the eye 😆that I started Binge watching 😁😁hIs acting was 🔥🔥so when I finally caught up, SADLY the next episode was his last one; obviously, I was heartbroken, so you can imagine how excited I am now for this reunion to happen; hopefully, it will be a happy ending for both; as the show has lost so many beloved characters, I would hate to see these two have a tragic end as well.
Ahhhhh mannnnnn🔥🔥🔥🔥
Just hope we get more information about the infection and how it started or who started it everyone knows the French did but we don’t know
good gosh, i thought this ish was over with. are they ever going to stop making walking dead???
wait is there new season 12 where is Rick coming back or new episode in season 11
ждём...
I honestly wish i got more hyped than i am. I think it might be a bit too late… i hope i’ll be proven wrong when watching it tho.
It's time to start living in the real.. world.
Is this shit canon from comics a little bit ?
Machone
Oh man, I can’t wait!
Why doesn't Andrew age bruh
rick grimes coming back before gta6 is wild
All the other walking dead shows will be obsolete come February 25
I’m so excited to see Rick and Michonne returns to the walking dead.
Is there going to be season 12 ??
this is still goin on?????
жду :)
FUCK YES, I'VE BEEN WAITING
<3
I’m ready!!!
Welp, I’m back to watching TWD when this comes out.
Rick is the walking deck
Change profile to Rick
Looks mid like most the walking dead stuff definitely should have picked a stronger name to as the title. I like Rick though so I might give it a try.
Holy shit that looks epic. I just really hope it doesn't take till the last 10 mins of the last episode of the season for them to be reunited.
How is this show still a thing? 🤦🏻‍♂️
А почему не 24 февраля?)))
olmamış.
welcome bak rick grimes!
Epic lol
When will this shit end...
hell yeah, im so ready for this.
who's that at 1:42
There has to be a plan to reunite everyone.
❤🇧🇷🇧🇷
It’s John Locke lets goooooo!!!!!
Это МЫ СМОТРИМ!)))
Goosebumps
Alexandria Forever VV
Anything Rick and I'm watching.
Only one good thing in this. Terry O'quinn.
ricks back !
Tbh it seems Rick is kinda of a villain no matter what group he encounters he ends up killing them and taking over
2월 25일???
Excited for this although the trailer kinda sucks lol
Why they took Rick? Must  a decent  reason...
Trailer song anyone???
Cannot wait. LOVE that Terry O’Quinn has joined the cast!
This looks amazing – they better not fuck it up!
I don’t think anybody notices cause I didn’t see in the comments but the guy in the mask at the end is definitely Daryl you could tell by the way he walks and moves his head.
What the time this is set it
Duck yeah man can’t wait to finally see Rick back after all these years
Hi Rick!
That's Morgan Jones walking in at the end😂
damn
1:36 Oh shit Rick
I really like how it feels like a movie instead of looking like a tv show trailer.
In the trailer when the CRM man is talking to rick he says "Do you want a cure? Do you want to die?" I think rick will be proven to be immune possibly because he was locked in the hospital for so long he was never exposed to the original walker virus and that rick will act sort of like ellie from TLOU. Needing to be killed to make a cure.
john locke is back lol
It's new movie??????
I gave up on the Walking Dead after the Wisper season. But I'm m watching this..
બંધ કરો ભાઈ તમે તો બોવ ખેચ્યું TMKOC ની જેમ.
Shane
❤ Rick And Shone Unstoppable ❤
O homem está voltando
JOHN LOCKE IS IN THE CRM 🫵🏻🫵🏻🗣️🗣️🗣️
They made so many series out of 1 that they are all connected somehow! It’s too much!!
Where is RJ? a drawing of their daughter but not their son?🧒🏿 looking forward to more TWDU😊
So glad to see this trailer finally!  Rick is Back! Michonne is back!  Time for him to get back home!
Riiick LOOK EVERYBODY ITS RICK !!
The  famous Rick Grimes！
Danai Gurira has a face that could make plant grow
*🥱*
Major Commador Beale has a very short amount of screen time to surpass a lot of incredible villains from the series. Here's hoping he becomes the most sinister of them all.
yeah the fact is michonne looking for her husband but is rick looking for his wife? no I'm not sure abt that. Its more like he find him new squat.
"People are a resource. I had someone special, I had an A, but I lied and said that he was a B so that he wouldn't end up in your mother's lab. I owed him that much."
Yeah, less ideas, more money. 😂😂😂😂 Better do NOT live.
Can't wait 😢😢😢😢❤❤❤❤
She abandoned her family to search for the Whiteman. Even in the zombie apocalypse we have 🛌 🔧
IM SMASHING MY HEAD OFF A WALL I LOVE RICK
1:30 did michonne shout daryl?
The walking dead would’ve been a lot better if it was more focused on rick
Let's go it's gonna be on my birthday
Bro just stop it. You ruined the show long ago. There is no way you can save it
tf is happening
I CANT WAIT
To goats standing together John lock and Rick grimes
Anyone know the song/music in the background? Absolutely love it!
OMG! This spin off will be a very good season! I hope the CommonWealth and CRM unites
Putz!!  Que do caraaaaaaaaaalhooooooooo...   The Walking Dead Fênix.
They seem to be purposely hiding Ricks left hand. If you go at 0.25 speed and pause it at 1:00 it looks like he has a machete as a left hand. Just like the comics 😂 looks like it got cut off.
I am so hyped !
We're The Ones Who Live
USE ME AS A LIKE BUTTON FOR ALL OF US WHO HAVE BEEN WATCHING SINCE HALLOWEEN 2010 AND NEVER GAVE UP ON THE SHOW. Our Boy is back!!!
RICK GRIMES IS BACK BABY!!!!!
Rick micchone Darryl Morgan and Megan need to reunite
Week 😔
Been watching this show since i was 10 years old. Now that im 24 its time to finish ricks story as a man.
great! keep to parasitize a once-popular show!
Holy crap
On my birthday what a nice gift thank you lol
Look at my eyes sir u tell me 🤐
Flogging a dead horse...
Gonna be watching this for sure🙌🏻 I stopped watching after season 9 when Rick left so glad to see him back
This is going to destroy TV audience records.
Omg it's been toooooooo long Mr Ricky Doo Dar Grimes is Back .....Bring it on ❤
5 years too late lol
....the REAL Walking dead and at last a real closing for the series....Without him there is NO Walking dead....
after years the murderer with the red handle is finally back
So many spin offs send my head spinning . 😂😂 Whens ever gunna end ? 😮
I’m speechless!  I have been waiting, so long for this😢😢😢 RICK🫢
Andrew lilcoln😁 I love
Walking dead must die
The series is 😂
Will Morgan show up in the Series???
que locura que sos rick
Why does Rick look different
I REALLY wanna know what's the song/soundtrack playing in the back throughout this trailer
Why do you only see Rick right hand has he lost his left hand
0:47 maze!!!
Nice to see the return of Andrew and Danai, but I certainly would not be seeing this one. I prefer my zombie movies/TV shows to be about the zombies being the main antagonists, not just humans. It makes things more immersive for me rather than them being just background noise. This is why I so much enjoyed Brad Pitt's World War Z and TLOU.
Рик, с возвращением, дружок!!!
Ik ben Nederlands dit best serie die er bestaat
Wow.
Rick looks like he's been on the kebabs
Oh we are back!! This is going to be sick.
How are they so clean
Wow this actually looks like it has a decent budget 👌
PLEAAAAAAAAAASSSE I CAN'T WAIT 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Where is negan
Is it a series or a film ?
His wife cheated on him on s1 so i stop watching can anyone tell if she got karma or not ?
Urge ver esto!!!
Can’t wait
неожиданно и шикарно
Gente ele volta em qual temporada ?
just milking at this point lol
THIS LOOKS EPIC
I watched it from the first season to the last season and this season is very exciting.
Why did it take 10 years for this probably great 1st season like the original, and the next ones to be shit so long to make?
Bro def lost his left hand was in the trailer once
Lori grimes all over again
Does Rick lose a hand??? 😮
YESSS!!!!
Cant fking wait
Now THIS is how you build the hype 🔥🔥 🔥
Oh… so he’s just on the island with John Locke!
HOW IS JADIS STILL ALIVE?!
Omfg! I can't wait! I'm counting down the days.
This is going to be big bigger bigest
I got chills.......
Im stoked
I know it’s a long shot but I want to be notice by AMC and see if there are any possibility’s that I can be involved in one of your upcoming shows
They got the O.G. STEPFATHER actor in this. Hopefully the writing isn't atrocious
Mind blowing 🔥🔥
John Locke!!!!
I can't wait to see this!
HYPED for the GOAT to return 🔥🔥🔥🔥
the two best characters in the show got their own show. amazing
John locke 😊
WTF is AMC+
There’s  Portland ..   Scene with helicopters flying over Forrest towards mountains w snow is the poster card of the Pacific Northwest..
I am so hyped for this
jhon lock
It won’t be good.  It’ll be full of a bunch of DIE inspired story and cast decisions and it’ll just be garbage.
Wow that’s looks better than I ever imagined. Jus wow
😱😱😱
Rick never knew Michonne was pregnant, he doesn't know he has another child.
マジで楽しみっす✋ユーネクストだけど
Quero ver o Rick reencontrando o Daryl 😢❤
Omg i can't wait i am soooo excited to see the new part 😊😊😊
❤
Iam so fucking READDDDDYYYYYYYYY
I stopped watching after the Prison so....idk what's happening.
I just realised that Terry O’Quinn is playing Rick’s, um, boss? I guess. I’m now 34x more excited for this shit. I love when an actor/actress from another show you love joins another show you love.
theyre really milking this and its already been dead years ago
1:40  MORGAN???
Im having anxiety waiting omg!!🔥🔥🔥❤️
Hes back baby!
the u.s government is back boysss
Carl's death is the bigger error in all TWD story
Is Rick finally gonna lose his hand?
وش يصبرررررني😭
Não acredito! Até quem fim já tava esperando por isso tô muito feliz.
Que saudade do Rick na série hem, estou super ansioso para ver o retorno dele 😁😁😁
LET THEM COOK
Id be more hyped for this if it wasn;'t confirmed its only 1 mini season and then done
1:42 heath?????
Can’t wait for this ❤
please the walking dead season 12
15 year olds getting hyped for this will be the same ones hating on it when it flops.
The series looks fun but it honestly doesn't look like Andrew is into it. Hopefully these scenes just had some bad line reading because I don't want to see him phoning it in the whole series.
God I really hope this will be a redemption ending to TWD. Really don't like how hard it fell off after Rick left
Se viene con todo!
Better not be last episode they see each other
I thought this was a movie?
Thought I’ve never see the day either one of them return back to the show. 🥲
John Locke vs Rick Grimes 🔥
I hope we get a proper game set in AMC’s TWD universe that is actually good and not made by Overkill.
Style is played out like Arnold when I’m whatcu talkin bout Willis
i wish this was a movie. i’ll give rick a chance. hopefully there aren’t filler episodes where he’s not even in it
I remember when this was announced as a feature film trilogy…. And then I was incredibly disappointed when they decided to turn it into a tv show instead…. But after seeing this trailer, OMGGGG They definitely retained that movie budget and I am so excited
This is gonna be the best spin off! So excited to see Rick again! and also Michonne? FOOL PROOF SERIES
I don’t get excited for TwD anymore but I am a little thinking of the fact that these spin offs will eventually reunited all of them one day.
The ONLY issue I've ever had with WD is how "healthy" survivors look like the hair sheen or combed, teeth white and even clothes kinda look pressed and folded.
Looks incredible!  I stopped watching after Glenn died.  Never could get back into the show.  This might bring me back!
Shyt look like it's gone be weak
how long do these side shows usually last?
Nah I'm good
Hopefully this is better than the other spin offs…Those were a hard watch…I couldn’t finish the Daryl Dixon one
Jeez another spinoff...maan The walking dead series is Goated...😂😂😂😂
That looks unreal
Rick grimeszzzz is back 🔥🔥🔥
I see a Babylon 5 actor in there.
It’s crazy to see it’s taken them this long to drag out the story you got people commenting “rip to the fallen soldiers who couldn’t make it” lol that’s when you know a show went on for too long.
I CANNOT WAIT
enter "stop! he's already dead!!" meme here
Bro tf are they getting the helicopters from wouldn’t be surprised if they had Tanks
CARL  !!!!!
25 de Fevereiro meu fi.chega logo 🥰😍😍😍😍🙏❤️❤️ Ansiosa demais Quem  mais tá?🙋‍♀️

I’m so freaking hype 😮
final final dot jpeg
Mishon will be dead
They ain't showed that man's left hand yet.... I see you, AMC
🔥🐐
Cant wait
How about a release in the uk for this and the spin offs
This looks so dope we all been waiting for this 🔥🔥🔥
bullshit amk i want the continuation of the whole plot not just a couple romance type of shit im single asf so i dont need that to tell me im even more single
Omfg they keep milking the series so hard,i dont believe this will be even 6/10
.
FINALLY
His wife died in season 2
OMG!! It's John Locke !!! 😆
John Locke has entered the zombie apocalypse
BRO I WANNA SEE RICK WITH HIS BADASS RED HANDLE MACHETE JUST SLICIN DICIN THE WHOLE GODDAM UNIVERSE THATS WHAT I WANNA SEE!!!
That pilot at the end definitely walks like Rick 👀
Holy bearded John Locke
Holy son of a biscuit eating bullfrog, I love this
Rick!!!!!! Welcome back and does anyone know the song to this trailer?😮🔥
Buen momento para estar vivo
It is great, but I do not like twd world became sci-fi shit
The guy from Lost!
I can’t fking wait 😂😂😂 just sad they can’t extend this to another season
Finally
We got Rick back before gta6
From India waiting for Rick's return😢❤ I am hungry for Rick🎉   And I Am The One Who Lives For Rick❤
It’s time to make things right
John PHUCKING Lockkkkkkk!!! OMG!!
TWD Dead City was good. TWD Daryl Dixon was great. TWD The ones who live will be epic,I`m sure.
If Daryl don’t save / find them I will be PISSED !!
😅 i bet they will be on different sides fighting each other. I think it's going to be good
Yea the king of walking dead is back
Finalmente 🔥🙏
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
Indian languages Telugu Tamil Hindi dubbing please 🙏🙏🙏
I can't wait to see that Show!
I know damn well that soldier @ the end is Daryl
They won’t show his left arm 👀
I hope it’s more than one season, I hope it’s at least between 2 to 4 seasons., well at least 4 season of this show.
virou resident evil saporra hehehehehe...
Looks nice better than WD S10 and 11... Proper post appocliptic world now
Bruh
Wait, this thing is still going?
I’m so happy to see Rick again
Epico
God I hate michonne so much, but excited to see ricks return finally
THE ENDING BETTER BE GOOD. LET RICK SEE DARYL AGAIN PLEASE
RICKY DICKY DOO DAA GRIMES
Soo… it’s a ghost town in Georgia, New York has no zombies and many thousands of people , France is stuck in the 1800s , and wherever this is , they have thousands of soldiers and super well kept military equipment… why do these spin offs feel like shit ? Nothing can capture the original feeling of the first few seasons of the walking dead.
This that walker on fire running 🤔. We have running walkers now.
I stopped watching when I found out it was Glenn that Negan killed. I am glad to see Rick and Michonne are both still alive…but separated somehow?
It doesn’t look like twd anymore
so excited
Джон Локк с "Остаться в живых")
This crap is still going on 😂😂😂😂
This is the way !! This is the ones who deserve to live 🎉🎉🎉
Hell yeah
Rick lost his hand 😭 look at 1.01 speed 0.25
Rest in Peace Carl Grimes ran a great warrior fought bravely😢😢
YESSSS
I hope we experience a great story, rather than only money making filler bullshit.
Why they didn't gather the whole team in one place I didn't understand
I would love to see the walker outbreak suddenly come to an end. Reports of recently deceased people not reanimating start coming in, walkers just dropping over for no reason etc. These people have been through absolute hell and it would be nice to see the world return to peace without walkers.
I can't wait for them to release the purr so I can finally see Rick Grimes
Let them cook
I just want to see how the CRM  was formed that's my only focus
How can I sleeeeeep 😩😩 please hurry up.
RICK GRIMES
Bro stop!
OMG 😍
Its rick! Look everybody, its rick! (Negan voice)
The problem with that statement is Judith isn’t his.
💥💥💥💥💥💥💥
So hyped this is gonna be fire
This show is so dumb it’s unwatchable. It was supposed to be Rick and Andrea. In the comics Rick and Andrea become a couple and she is a badass sharp shooter. Instead they totally changed the story and killed Andrea off for shock value. They completely ruined it and they robbed comic fans of seeing Rick and Andrea get together on the small screen. It was a big eff you to comic fans.
Best trailer I have ever seen!
…wait are the walkers CGI now??? Wth
They ain't only milking the cow  They butchering her
You know you're screwed when you meet needs a shave rick
25/2 2024 or 2025 ????!
Im so ready for this show to start ❤❤❤
Man, I had forgot all about this project. As someone who use to live for this franchise & seen all the TWDU shows(begrudgingly) it’s great to see Rick(arguably my favorite TV protagonist ever) I’ve lost faith in the universe/writers/producers… & dare I say it might be too late for this show to be huge as many of the fans have moved on/lost interest- even for Rick,I fear.  *Angela Kang was better than Gimple BUT those later seasons were crap. Just better than what Scott was giving us- To be fair she had scraps of a cast to work with & it was just a husk of a story.  *They should have never put Rick & Michonne together. They IMO never had that chemistry let alone this LOVE that just won’t die. It’s felt forced from the beginning.   *Dead city was meh,Daryl was meh,other TWD series bad to awful.   *with basically all the same producers,writers & even the great Greg nicotero IT ALL LOOKS & SOUNDS THE SAME. In a few aspects that’s good but overall it’s become repetitive,stale & low quality. Several of the earlier or mid run episodes were movie level from the writing to acting to the action(I blame AMC for lots of that)   I have to admit this trailer looks ok… but idk if I’m viewing with my head or heart. I’ll give it a shot.
I want 5 seasons of this at a minimum.
At starting the rick wakes up from hospital and from that moment twd universe gets more and more indulging and hoping to get rick meeting Judith and michonne would be the most satisfying part.. ❤❤
Never though i would see My Boy Rick again😢. About time AMC.
Thank you Andrew Lincoln America can't wait to see you again!
AYYYYYYYYYYYYY SAKA MI
IBELIEVE #coachprime
“Why” 🔥ain’t nothing like Rick grimes voice 💯
I guess they the part when Negan got taken in Dead City sets it up for Rick to return to the group. Maybe he even goes to rescue Negan
1) I’m glad they changed the name. _Rick & Michonne_ was not a good title. 2) What happened to the trilogy of cinematic movies we were supposed to get?!?! 3) Why hasn’t Andrew Lincoln been scooped up by Kevin Feige for the Marvel universe yet? 4) The Walkers took down the entire U.S. military (not to mention every other country’s government) so how do these guys stand a chance? 5) Rick’s gotta lose his hand in this, right? Looks like they finally have the budget for it. 6) I hope it’s better than every other spin-off this universe has produced so far!
Anyone who knows that walk, knows at 01:38 that is Rick Grimes.
Ich freue mich ❤
I really hate mishone as a character!!
Yeah.. no thanks.. let it go..
Rick lord i missed this man i stopped watching twd after he left im glad hes back
RICKS BACK BABY LETS GOO
i love oyu amc
Rick: How many walkers did you kill? how many people did you kill? Why? Lock: Don't tell me what i can't do
Uz sa neviem dockat🧟‍♂️🧟‍♀️🧟
I'm a better father then you rick
Looks like 💩 (I’ve never watched any of the shows)
Siktimin abd si heryerde hain
My daughter is due the day this comes out ❤️❤️
This is what we've all been waiting for
Grimes!!!!!!!❤❤❤❤
期待😮
Finally!!!! 🎉
It's only 6 episodes I hope it's not them both trying to find one another the whole time.
Please don't ruin it with all the SJW crap...
Who else stopped watching after season 8 ?
Release it today. I am tired of waiting.
Drinking game. Everytime character gets attacked by ninja walker, we drink.
I wonder if John Locke will go down to ‘The Hatch.’
Esto será legendario
I hope it features zombies.
Gone be fire!!!
Who's chopping the onions!
Am I the only one who wants to see rick and negan face to face again
YES
To me Rick looks a little younger than he did in season 9 which was 5 / 6 years ago
The title is kinda dumb, but the trailer is actually pretty good. I just hope that the show doesn't lean too much on sappy symbolism.
Q vivan los espositos
FUCKING HYPED!
Can't wait
أنا كرهت والكينغ داد ملي كرهت راح ريك و حبستو كي ماتت ألفا  يبان الجزء هاذا عظمة مي مراحش يعوضلنا قاع المتعة اللي فقدناها في جزء واحد. لازم عدة أجزاء
CRM: We have the most powerful military Rick: I have the most powerful family
The soldier in the end is rick
AMC isn’t even allowed in my country
John Locke!!!!
Can’t wait 😊
Haven’t been able to get into any of the other spin offs . Will be watching this though 🔥🔥
They have absolutely flogged the horse with this TV series
Ya se que la serie es de su país pero pongan subtítulos en español H D P
That season 5 rick stare the CRM are fucking with the wrong people
It looks like its gonna be 5 episodes of 2 seperate stories and renuion will come at the end....if so, that will be stink!! They shpuld find each other early and fight their way home to Judith and RJ
Rick shoulda died forever ago ffs
OMG IM SO EXCITED ❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥
No Daryl Dixon!!!!??? Lol
These fan made trailers are getting wild
ON MY BIRTHDAY 🎉🎉🎉 BEST BIRTHDAY PRESENT EVER 😂
This looks insane, but my wife stopped watching after glens death. I watched every episode. Looks like I’ll have the media room to myself.
Someone tell me a way to get this in the uk
Jacob told me we need to go back to the island.
I hate Rick. Worst leader in history.
Can’t waittttt
Hopefully this ain’t as bad as the last one
This shit about to be awesome!!!!..... I'm all hyped and ready!
Oh my God, I'm impatiently waiting for the show 🔥
I will be waiting !
I hate walking dead because all original people die stupid production
RICK もう少し信じてみて
This feels more like an ending than the last season did! Can’t wait!
The Walking Dead is dead without Rick Grimes. The moment the character left, the show was an absolute chore.
YES RIIIIICCCCCKKKKK!!!!! :) :) :)
FINALLYYYYYYYYYYYY
Omg I can't freaking wait!!!
Goat is back dudes❤
i want clementine and lee,
I didn't finish watching Walking Dead and stopped on s9. I thought i'd never return to this universe but i'm kind of excited for this series after watching the trailer. I do wonder how they're gonna wrap up Rick and Michonne storylines
I still remember his Nickname that people give. Rick the Prick. Negan gang will never forget this
最後に登場した兵士はサイラスか？
woooowwwwww!!!!!!
😮😮😮😮😮😮
🙏😑The whole world is set up to show consequences for doing wrong. All have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God. We all must be willing to turn from sin and believe and follow Jesus for forgiveness. 1st John 2:17 He who does the will of God abides for eternity. That’s letting Jesus live His life in and through us His children, by knowing and obeying the Word of God !!! ❤️📖nkjv🙏🧎🏻‍♂️🕊🇺🇸🕊
The world's gonna need Rick Grimes
OMG OMG OMG THIS LOOKS SO GOOD I CANT WAITTTT
You can polish a turd but it's still a turd. Fans who left after Rick will come back to see what's happening but, let's be honest here, will there be  enough new fans to create a viable base to justify an ongoing show? And once the initial excitement of seeing what happened to Rick between then and now will long-term fans want to see what will be the same-old same-old as was happening in the show after Rick left?  It's a real shame because this was an absolutely amazing franchise, and I think if Rick had had his own show/arc from TWD season six or seventeen it would have been better than the parent show. But what else is there to say...?
now THIS is walking dead. return of the G.O.A.T. The Ricknater is BACK!
Endlich wieder Rick! 💙
Please don't let Chris Hardwick have commercial spots in between. His Talking Dead killed the series for me.
So we're gonna have another fascist state ruled by some psychos and destroyed by few people with nothing to loose?
It's sad to think that Jesus, Enid, Tara, etc. would never know Rick is still alive. 😢
Im so pumped
Hot Diggity Dog, Rick is back.
Largou as cria pra correr atrás de macho 😢.  A filha levando tiro na cara e ela passeando 😂
1:10 music ??
God, I cant wait to see the iconic Rick Grimes and Michonne again!! 🔥 It's been TOO LONG WITHOUT THEM!!
Endlich! Zum Ende wird die Serie noch richtig gut+ich hoffe,es wird nicht mehr so viel geredet,wie vorher immer! (75%reden25%action)
Nope I hated the way you kicked Rick out of the finale on the Original Series so I'm not watching any more of your crap
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💯
THE GOAT RETURNS
John Locke from LOST is back!!!
“MY WIFE IS MY CHOICE MY DAUGHTER IS MY CHOICE” 👿 TALK TO DEM PEOPLE RICKKKK THE GOAT IS BACK🔥
Top 10 stupid fanbase for sure
This should be in theaters..
RIP GLEN
Looks amazing unfortunately I’m in Scotland and I’ve still not been able to see Maggie & Negan Dead City & Daryl Dixon I’m GUTTED !! AMC isn’t available over here 😫😫😪, Rick & Michonne Starts 1 day after my birthday it would be a geeet present 🎁 for me not just for a b/day but going through chemotherapy 😢& I’ve missed my TWD soooooo much ❤ your A1 from day 1 fan Fiona in  🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 xx
Your eyes tell me you're tired of amc's bullshit
Can't even get hyped for this since Dead City and Daryl Dixon haven't even aired or streamed here in the UK 😢
I AM SO FUCKIN EXCITED FOR THIS I LITERALLY, HELP!!!!! Aaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!💁🏾‍♀️🫶🏾🫶🏾🫶🏾🫶🏾🫶🏾🫶🏾🫶🏾🇬🇧(Sorry).
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Is this gonna be 1 episode per week upload or it's gonna be whole season upload at the same time?
Wie ich mich freue nur noch ein paar mal schlafen 😂
Bruh legend is back🤩
finally.
Calling it now, the show ends with rick dying.
Waiting
is noone else gonna see how that guy has a girl voice 💀💀
wow this looks horrible whoever removed scott gimple from running twd should be banned from producing anything ever again everything the characters, dialogue, camera filters, editing is just all wrong same with the other two spin offs and s9 - 11
25 февраля выйдет только первая серия в оригинале? Где можно узнать даты выхода всех серий?И через сколько примерно это выйдет в русской озвучке или с субтитрами?
I can’t wait to see the reaper Rick Mfn Grimes & the Sorcerer Assassin Michonee !!!!
RICK FUCKING GRIMES IS SOOOOOOOO BACKKKKKKK
WHAT THE SHITTTTT I AM SO FREAKING EXCITED MY GOODNESSSS
1:13 why is the Atlanta napalm scene being reused for the trailer
After watching the daryl dixon series I have very low expectations for this
For everyone who was waiting for rick to come back, a lot of speculation that he won't, but the real ones believed and knew  ! ! !
0:40 wtf is that ? a dude with a femlae voice ?
I hope every friend of grime unites in the middle of this show, we want everyone to come together and get out of the mess.
Why is she looking for him? Didn't they all think he died on that bridge?
Not interested at all. Walking dead became TRASH because they never addreseed what caused the end of the world. They just focused on stupid battles between groups of people. Not gonna spend another 5-10 years watching a show that has no ending.
Kinda too late
Zombies better have mutated and are able to run because they should all be dead by now
The Ones Who Got Chompy
От музыки в конце мурашки по коже😊
Greatest tv show ever hands down 🔥🐐to be able to keep fans this interested this long is jus mind blowing 💯🔥
Rick is TWD! and TWD is Rick!!
I am so happy Rick and Michone are finally gonna reunite
Hopefully we’ll get this in the Uk
I know everyone would say it's stupid but that show would be even more amazing without michonne only rick who's in the military
Всё прекрасно, но что за мания началась везде афроамериканские герои в главных ролях, ничего против них не имею но в каких то фильмах, местах, сценариях более органично смотрятся, европеоиды. К чему этот перекос в одну сторону, бросаетесь из крайностей в крайности. Теперь получается притеснение европеоидов. Сейчас невозможно представить фильмы без афроамериканца, китайца и индуса и это хорошо, кино всегда было интернациональным и межрассовым. Но последние тенденции это уже смахивает на бред. Как например Диснеевская русалочка!  ИМХО.
My goodness.  They did not forget about the fans.  This looks good.
I really hope TWD saga comes to a close with Rick, Michonne, Daryl, Carol, Maggie, and the rest of the main gang go back and live happily ever after at Herchels farm
So hyped for this - I sincerely hope AMC get it right and apart from all the chills and thrills, they deliver what the fans actually want - to reunite Rick and Michonne with their family and friends.  Funny how a lot of people are simply mentioning Rick reuniting with Daryl - it’s cool - but jets not forget that the series of events that led to Rick’s ‘death’ in season 9 were a result of Daryl starting a fight with Rick and then driving off leaving him alone to fend for himself….for the second time……
รอนานมาก....
Я так долго ждала возвращения Рика... 🤩Обожаю ❤
I cannot freakin wait. 😱
Finally back Rick Grimes 😅
I'm happy that they're back, but it would be great if this continues in TWD Season 12.
Not very impressive.  Sorry....
Yall watching the show for the plot, me , an intellectual : 1:26
Everything looks so elevated.  From that first scene of Rick waking up in the Hospital to this, what a survival journey it has been.
they're back!! i have a few theories here just by the trailer but did rick lose a hand?!?
sonunda aq :D
The one who leaves just remember me Harry Potter 😂😂
😴  No thanks. This smells like the last 3 seasons of The Walking Dead, its going to suck.
Still a long ways away but I can't wait!
Nah. Not without Carl.
Where's Morgan
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Carl should be there with him, y’all fucked y’all killing him off
Rick Returns ❤
Almost here...waited too long. Been Ready.
The Rick Grimes x John Locke crossover no one expected… So excited🎉🎉
Two little too late
Damn! Rick is back! Hell yes!
The Walking Dead is Rick Grimes. If Andrew Lincoln is in, then so am I.
I am definitely watching this!!
Rick Grimes, John Locke. 🤘
We are going to see John Locke tell Rick he can’t go back and he can’t get off the island.
im hyped missed my boy rick
0:37, The Phone Says “Try It And Believe It A Little More” In Japanese
Bruh IS HERE LOCKE!!!!!! 😱😱😱😱😱
Rick is dead..... story ended, but they keep going.   Sick of it, honestly
😍
Yessir
I wanted them to be together since she showed up in season 3. I got my wish in season 6. So it gives me great joy to hear Rick call her his wife. It gave me great joy on the show, when Judith called her Mom. And even when Carl was speaking to her once, he let her know that he thought of her as family.
Every series has been bad.  A season of, "Where's Carl?"  Carol magically blowing up a fuel tank, and that somehow manages all of them that were hostages and tied up to escape a well guarded compound and not be cannibalized.  A group of them in the middle of a highway, with no one within miles, then all of a sudden everything goes black, and they all wake up, tied up hostages in a building in a town.  Maggie, _NOT_ killing Negan!  That so-called character was a complete wash after that.  And, on and on and on with the nonsnese.  But, hey, a lot of people love zombies.
Let me tell you something
1:14 isnt this a scene from season 1?
Is this edited???
rick is missing his left wrist you can see @1:01 in slow mo fighting the zombie on fire
Ohhhh my good
john locke
Wow just to see the whole reunion   from rick and daryl  wont miss it
What's the song's name of the trailer?
Why aren’t they showing his other hand😳
Rick we love you !!!
So ready!!!!
I hope they get a happy ending and reunite with everyone
To see Rick back in TWD, My heart is full ♥️
Always wanted a Call of Duty, Walking Dead crossover, now we all get to rate it 6.3
Ending music ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Bro this shit looks so fire
I'm holding out hope that we get to see him reunite with everyone but it's looking like they went in a way different direction here
0:27 Daughter
Everyone sleep this program, it's lame 😴😪
Aguarden ...Areia branquinha 2  Mc pp da vs  Instagran / spotify/ youtube
Beyond excited omg
Mc pp da vs 🇧🇷mc pp da vs 🇧🇷mc pp da vs 🇧🇷mc pp da vs 🇧🇷mc pp da vs
bro it's fucking John Locke from lost
I'm just glad we are returning to slaying zombies and the threat they pose. Yall focused on human/group conflict way too long imo
Damn, this franchise went to shit.  It got repetitive, stale and redundant.  I've been watching since day one, even read the comics and the show when to shit.  After Negan was introduced, there was one good season then it tanked, the season with Alpha was good then it went right back downhill.  It's been milked too much with all the spinoff and side stories
We are headed for uncharted territory and I feel this series is going to be a sort of nexus point for the future of the franchise!
The Return ❤
Jhon lock ctm 😮😮
Ansioso demais !!
This looks like the best spinoff by far. And they have Terry O’Quinn in here too.
Who was the last guy in the mask
0:57 We have John Locke now!! ♡
They're in Philadelphia great
I’m soo ready!! Wea you been Rick ???
Rick better get to say the F word as much as Mr Dixon did in his show. Screw AMC if he doesn't (see what I did there 😉).
When Rick said “my wife is my choice” 😮‍💨😮‍💨 made me proud to finally hear him refer to Michonne as HIS WIFE 🤗 I’m here for all the Richonne moments
If this doesn't end in a reunion with Judith and RJ and Daryl then it's an absolute waste of time and effort
I hope it's as good as the hype. FTWD deserved better than those writers gave them.
Omg I just finished TWD and I was like what the heck is happening with Rick and michonne…I was upset lol - I’m soooo excited to see this!
Compared to the other shows made, this one looks like it got potential
Trailer song name ?
Cannot wait
All I keep thinking to myself is he’s back he’s back the legends back
Soundtrack name ?
They made an avengers level spin off
Nice!
Credit where credit is due... looks good
I’m buzzing with joy!!! Can’t wait to see these two reunited
Looks better then the other two
I hope everyone is doing well. I would like to share the good news you. There is only one God. “Within the one Being that is God, there exists eternally three coequal and coeternal persons, namely, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.” God has appointed his only Son to judge the living and the dead. We have all sinned and broken God’s law, such as lying, stealing, lusting, anger, and pride. God is Holy, Just, and Impartial. That is why when God judges he cannot let even one sin from anyone go unpunished and that punishment is eternal hell. We can’t work our way into heaven and our good deeds can’t save us from our sin. The bible says all our righteous acts are like filthy rags. We would perish if we died and faced God with our own righteousness.   The Good news is that God is also Love and Merciful and sent his only Son to save his people from their sin. Jesus who is fully God and fully human, lived a perfect life and never sinned. He willingly went to the cross where the Father took the wrath that his people deserved and put it on Jesus. Jesus paid the price for their sin and died on the cross. He was buried and on the third day God raised him from the dead. God commands all people everywhere to repent of their sins and to put their trust in Jesus. Biblical repentance is a change of mind about Sin. It’s an attitude of the heart, genuinely turning from sin to God. Everyone who repents and puts their trust in Jesus, will have their sins credited to Jesus, and Jesus’s righteousness will be credited to them. Their sins will be forgiven, and they will be given eternal life. When it’s time to face God, he will welcome them into heaven because of Jesus’s perfect righteousness.
LOL Ric Grimes just met a demon. Mazikeen got bored of bounty hunting.
"People are a resource. I had someone special, I had an A, but I lied and said that he was a B so that he wouldn't end up in your mother's lab. I owed him that much."
Rick Grimes.. THE GOAT!!
❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉😂😂😂
It's amazing how TWDU has been adapting since the world ended. This new series is going to be epic!
Ojala q en el doblaje no se inventen otra vez voces raras 😅
It's for Emmy!
Anybody know the music?
It's fucking Rick
john locke gonna fuck everyone up
Murder Jacket about to cook everyone
How tf rick know Japanese?😂
Is it February 25th yet!! 🤯
YEAHHH
Just finished TWD today and had no idea this is dropping, are there more spin-offs or other series for streaming?
Jhon lock ❤
THE WALKING DEAD WAS NEVER THE SAME AFTER HE LEFT
Let me guess, a newly introduced villain does villainy things until the villain gets killed and replaced with another villain? No thanks, i dealt with that for 6 seasons in TWD, I’ve seen all I need to see.
I think at the end of the first episode, Michonne will be caught by the CRM.   Coming off of a helicopter will be Rick, who is now a soldier.   The 2nd episode will be the story of his journey over the 6 year time jump.
Terry  O'Quinn is a class act.
Looks like a movie more than it does a tv show
woah
Greatest Comeback
ON FIREEE! THIS IS GOING TO BE MASTERPIECE!!!  🔥🔥🔥
Why does jadis always get the worst haircuts, season 9 was the only time it looked good 😭
Hell yeah lessgoo
He'll yeah lesso
Nice ima call it TWDTOWL
these have become the worst franchise  spin offs ever damn show has been on since 2010 and its not really any better
Welcome Back Andrew Lincoln!
THIS LOOKS FIRE MAN💯
14 years and it's still going, getting worse every reiteration.  Dumpsterdate then killing Carl and having Rick Michonne Daryl and Negan be INVULNERABLE makes this show unwatchable and just a weak cash grab.  No thanks.
Where's Carl?
For someone who stopped watching after season 9, its time to come back
Acho que não foi só eu, mas esse olhar do Rick pro major general Beale lembrou muito o olhar do Nick em Fear
Ameeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeei juro, eles reutilizando a cena de atlanta bombardeada, genios
I’m actually excited for this. Rick never needed to leave. But I get it and understand about wanting to spend real time with his family for his kids grew up before he couldn’t recognize them
This is the first time we’ve ever heard Rick call Michonne his wife
I'm a little disappointed in the VFX. Looks just like the other series. Wished some of the movie ambitions would have spilled over.
Nell no one of the original gonna see
Got chills watching this trailer.
You know what’s crazy.. they say this will be a 6 episode series.. but I think once they see how good it is and how it turns out they will apply for season 2.. my prediction or theory tbh, I feel like they forced Rick to be apart of what happened at Omaha maybe once he realized what they were doing he tried to rebel and escape and they caught him again and again and again… I think he’s gonna be on there good side so he can find out as much as he can and maybe befriend a few people and learn the ins and outs.. I think also that michonne will indeed see Rick working for them before they reunite..
NIck and Michonne reunited : what a dream ! Hope the show is as good as it looks ! Have only been disappointed by all the TWD spin offs so far. Time to go back to the origins !
🗿🍷
This shit gonna be loaded with SOOOOOOO many commercials.  Original show went to crap because it became all about the $$$.  That's a huge factor for doing anything of course but for them they HAPPILY sacrificed quality.
Justo el día de mi cumpleaños 🎉
1:14 is the same scene when shane sees atlante gets destroyed
This what they saw in Miami
Personal 101 alot of Rick and Major General Beale Awesome trailer
Look in my eyes… you tell me
and the Fire Walkers Crazy daisy and I also like the Walker with a Metal head Spikes made me think of the Walk Winslow from Season 7
I've really missed Rick and Michonne!!!!!!!!!!!!
did they get rid of the writes that made this show abysmal?
My favorite scene is Atlanta in the trailer the Memories it was Napalmed in The Walking Dead Season 2 episode 5 fladhnacks witj Shane and Lori I can't wait to find out more about it
JOHN LOCKE!!!!! 😍
THE GOAT IS BACK!
Look its John Locke
Wtf happend to the walking death i dont get this story anymore
THE GOAT IS BACK!!!!! 🐐
Rick and Michonny 🤠
RICK DADDY GRIMMESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
Vai ter dublado?
Im a bit worried here...this does not look or feel like the Walking Dead series....it's way more blockbuster-esque and that is about as far away from the cinematic walk up the hill towards heads on spikes or the CDC you can get. I remain in hope.
Is season 12 coming!!!!!!!!!!??????!!!???!!?!
The best zombie in the world
Bro……it’s gonna be a battle between HOTD and TWD as far as ratings go this year!!!
John Locke??!
Тепер для мене є сенс дожити до 2025
Que Cringe medio de ver esto
Man I love Rick!
Budget looks nice and good for this one
My life is my choice
ricks back
I hope crm is going to be on the good side
When does it come to the uk tho
Shout out to Tyler Heckman ❤
"You showed me I can't get away.. " plz end it with "but you can"
2nd time watching this now
MOM AND DAD ARE BACK! 🥲
Crazy how fwd came this far from s1
Wtf going on
ISTG the season better not end with them finally finding each other or some other lame shit like they just missed each other.
1:14 is this bombing Atlanta ?
The greatest character in TV is back!!!
Going to be interesting how they end this compared to the comics which they cannot follow anyways given Carl is dead and they've already done the group who kills Rick in the comics. So going to be interesting how this new set of villains is tackled.
CAN"T F'N WAIT
CUIDAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Tem wue vir em português essa porra
Ricky Doo Dah Grimes
These spinoffs are so damn good
The crm leader is from the USA army it could be he was related to the bombing in Atlanta
Hi 👋
Hangi kanalda
superrrrr
0:40 wtf is that
JOHN LOCKE?
Please can they stop doing an over-emphasised Afrikaans accent in every TV show and film 😓
Ppl still watching this trash?😂
Hope it’s good. I stopped watching when the killed Glen.
God when will they let this franchise die
😭😭😭🔥🔥🔥🔥
Meh
1:10 john locke! Im in
How is it that every thing Rick says is cool?!
I miss My Rick Grimes🖤🖤🖤🖤
Rick,michone,Daryl, carol,judith all better be able to see each other again. At the very least.
John Locke?!
Fucking finally!!!! Mf grimes. We waited for yearssss. Hopefully a reunion. Especially with Daryl 😭
The past few seasons have been dogshit, but might be something here
Holy fuk about time!! ❤😂🎉
Don’t know much about the walking dead can anyone explain what plot I can expect in this spin off?
COME!!!!
Non vedo l'ora di tutto questo 🎉🎉🎉
Looks amazing can't wait for Feb 25
Watching after his departure in season nine. It's good that he still maintains that spirit of a bold leader. And it will seriously be an epic return for Danai and Andrew as Rick and Michonne.
Que série vai ser essa pqp   A melhor sempre de tds os tempos!!!!!!!
No one will beat the CRM they are the best.  If TWD was real I would love to be a CRM soldier.
Premieres on my birthday wtf that's awesome
These new crm soldiers look so much cooler than the old ones
1:40 Daryl or Morgan??
Who thinks Daryl is the soldier at the end of the trailer or Morgan?
CORAAAAAAAAAAAAAAL!
Ricky doo daa grimes baby!!
🔥🔥🔥, because sometimes emojis are all you need.
Interracial relentionships are gross
Looks like 1:14 is a flashback of when they bombed Atlanta.
All the great spin-offs seems like a great way to make up for the cheesy last season of the main show.
Can’t wait
Wooow ❤excited
i can’t keep up with all the spinoffs and timelines bruh
Amen…we’ve been waiting on ya Rick 👏🏾
Holy shit…
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Ути щечьки то какие!☺️Пожирнел, пожирнел  Рик🍔🤠
Hyped, but the animations look a bit cheap
Espero, por mi bien,  que sea 25 de Febrero de 2024  y No en Febrero del 2025 porque no se si llegamos a estar vivos en Argentina por como venimos😢
Febrero 2025? 😢
Ever season the walking dead makes it becomes more like z nation
Vai sair quando
The garbage is STILL going?!?!
Legends Never Die ❤
OMG I love Terry O’Quinn!
locke!!!
ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
De lujo
AH let’s fucking go.
Rick and Michonne coming home to us is the best thing I could ask for on TV right now.
Unfortunately this trailer sucks, it will not be a quality series.
where is Clementine?
0:40 what is this voice lol
Джон Лок из Лост. Дождалась.
This is too predictable everyone knows Rick takes over the military and ends up bringing all the community’s and his friends back together
czekałem na to !!!!!
YAHOO
Will it be on hbo
Nah this actually looks fye🔥 RICK!!!
Terry o Quinn holy shit John Locke
Qué es una película o serie cuando se estrena en España
Anyone from India like if you are Rick fan
this better be good
I just wish Rick and negan would meet
See, we don't need 5 spin off, we need 1 good And it's finally here
Anyone know if the possibility that he loses a hand is true I’ve been seeing a lot of speculation and talk about it
Looks cool. And maybe by 2054, it might actually be available in the UK.
fennna
Hope they dont ruin the show by doing this what am i saying its coming out in 2024 its gonna be woke as fuck
aaa
THE MOST AMAZING THING WE’VE GOTTEN IN A LONG WHILE 🔥🔥🔥
"Bless the LORD, O my soul: and all that is within me, bless his holy name. Bless the LORD, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits: Who forgiveth all thine iniquities; who healeth all thy diseases; Who redeemeth thy life from destruction; who crowneth thee with lovingkindness and tender mercies; Who satisfieth thy mouth with good things; so that thy youth is renewed like the eagle’s." (Psalm 103:1-5)  Lately the life of Christ burst out alive in me! Old things have passed away, even myself is new.  His life floods through me, like rivers towards the sea, His love shines on me like sun shining on the dew. With Christ I'll savor life Unending every day; Now and forever I'll walk with Him all the way.
Ojalá le pudiera dar mas de un like😁😁😁😁
🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷💓
Hurry up AMC
Looks like we're in for some " Full Rick" .....can't fucking wait....💪
Your only son died. Why are u living Grimes 🧐
I love how there’s no mention of his son at all, just how it should be.  AJ was such a miss for a new kid character and I think they’re subconsciously realizing that.
How did he go from being in his 50s with grey hair to this 35 year old, badass
Did they find new directors or something, this actually looks good
Civic Republic: we have an army Michonne: we have a Negan Rick: wait what?!?
I wonder if major general Beale will eventually have rick take over the CRM? That would be a twist.
Please dub the walking dead in hindi😢😢😢😢
RICK FCKING GRIMES
Let’s Go!!!!
THIS, THIS IS GONNA BE FIREEEEEE
Hate to rain on the train of positivity, but the wait was too long. Understandable Why, but it doesn't negate the fact that I lost interest. I mean, with all the fuck-ups and nonsense going on with Disney,  the Star Wars franchise, and The Rings of Power, I'm certain to be let down by AMC and TWD. It's like when we waited for the season 8 finale of GoT. We waited a year and what did we get? Utter garbage and bullshit!  The fans: "We waited a year for this?!" Only now it's with TWD. We waited...YEARS...for THIS?!
One episode a week is gonna kill me ...wish I didn't see this trailer for a couple months 😂
awww yeahhhhh
Did not view the video and did not read  the comment ´cause im actually watching with my girlfriend, this thumbnail and the one of Daryl dixon spoil me kinda hard :/
Its about time!
whoohoo finally thank you @TheWalkingDead Febuary 25th will come around faster then ya'll know can't wait yayyyy
I am sooooo burned out of this series after Season 3 of TWD... This makes me want to go and rewatch and prep for this. It honestly looks like a huge UPGRADE from TWD style/story.
This looks ass twd peaked at s2
This looks ridiculous.
I stopped watching after the season with Negan killing Glen. Is it worth watching the rest?
Am I the only one that doesn’t like rick and michonne as a couple?
Why people's are saying that Rick's gonna lose his arm??
Mazikeen on top
I'm mega hyped for Terry O' Quinn as the villain.
Fuck yesssssss
Gonna end up being 80% jadas / random new people and 20% Rick
Where’s Heath?
At least hairstylists still have employment during such a late stage in the zombie apocalypse.
I have been waiting for this for years. It's going to be amazing.
I can't wait!!!
fun fact this show premieres on february 25th the same day that 08x09 premiered in 2018.
Will this be on netflix?
YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
oh shit, oh shot, here it comes, the badass rick, fuckung serously <3
Super excited love love love Rick an Michonne❤❤ Hopefully it’ll being back the feeling of the original serious, the suspense the real story telling, rather than Fear the walking dead, and the other spin-offs not including (Daryl Dixon // DeadCity) , couldn’t really get into them. Just skimmed through them to keep updated, just felt it was rushed and cheesy. Not a lot tv shows an movies from the last coupe years have felt and been good. Just something about the new age of entertainment. 😢 Totally missing the 2000’s movies and shows. They had grit. Real story telling.
Hope it’s better than Daryl Dixon. Was very disappointed in that
Daryl Dixon 👎🏼 Dead City 👎🏼 The Ones Who Live 🎉
So I guess the movie's now a new series, still up for it though lmao.
Bro in the end of the trailer is this Rick??
Them graphics crazzy!! 🔥🔥
Anyone else got a feeling Morgan will show up with Mo, Al and Als girlfriend?
morgan  1:40
Locke is here too!
por fin regreso la verdadera esencia de TWD
I'll never be able to understand how people stopped watching this amazing show. Not once did I ever get bored. I may not agree with decisions made or how they treated some of the actors but I love TWD.
❤️
RICK THE GOAT
M E H
Don't understand why there are so many excited commenters. The show got so bad that I couldn't even finish it. Is there any reason to be excited for this slop besides the return of Rick?
Honestly that trailer was pretty weak but I don’t even care cuz Rick Grimes is back let’s go!!!😎
THIS LOOKS SO INSANE CANT WAIT
The return of the greatest TV character ❗️🔥
Can't wait
It's hard to tell if this'll be any good. This is a decent trailer but the walking dead has put out nothing but trash for years now
Daymm what took so long?
OMG!!!!! I love it. I LOVE IT!!! RICK IS COMING!!!
Any one from Kerala 🎃
It  is not lost on me the elements used here to remind us of Black Panther.  Michonne in leather armor and the drums are a dead giveaway.
Rick Grimes is BACK!!!! I couldn't be any more excited. Awesome trailer
When she said "We can make this whole damn world ours if we want to" I felt that
Ураааааааа 🎉🎉🎉🎉 Как же я долго ждал как я обожаю этот сериал
This will be the cherry on top, a masterpiece!
Looks like 80% Michone and 20% Rick's show... Hope they don't Fckup this time.
🧐
😭I'm very excited
CAN THEY JUST FUCKING STOP WITH TIS SHIT ALREADY MY GOD
Imagine if the CRM has A10 Thunderbirds.
Oooowww rick dostum sonunda geldin sabırsızlıkla bekliyorum
Can’t wait for this. Would also love for the AMC+ app and website to be better than it is. So many playback issues that are non existent if I’m watching the main series on Netflix. 😊
I’m so ready
Glen, Carl and Andrea.
enough!
Can you just go away?  We can't miss you if you never leave.
This is gonna be great 👏👏
Or just come out with the already made episode now.
Am I the only one who thinks that Rick's voice has changed?
W lets its been too long
Rick gonna take over the CRM and give us the proper ending for him we've been waiting for
Omg omg omg!! I have literal chills!!!
"People are a resource. I had someone special, I had an A, but I lied and said that he was a B so that he wouldn't end up in your mother's lab."
God it’s so good to see rick again
shortest 2  mins of my life!!!!! i need more!!!!!!!!!!
Name of music?
John Locke.
1:21  Is that morgan?
A cinematic masterpiece is coming aaah! The feels .
You waited too long no one cares anymore take years off and expect us to just wait here @-$-$+ OFF!
That will be 8 seasons of them just missing each other by seconds then when they do meet they’ll realise they’ve both changed and go their separate ways.
Aïe aïe aïe ça met des frissons 💥💯🔥
rick forgot his son? lmao
The zombies haven’t died off yet
If I don't get a Daryl Dixon and Rick Grimes hug... Ima be pissed
Got goosebumps watching this!
I think a lot of people missed the messages from walking dead,the delusional people
Fuuuuuucj
Rick grimes is back 🔥 RIP to Co-or-oral
RICK!!!
Hmm stop watching Walking Dead ages ago but this looks good
All due respect but fuck michonne i wanna see rick and darryl reunite
I still think with Rick’s series and Daryl’s series and Maggie’s serious that they meet up by accident or cross paths for 2 episodes and catch up or it lead to all 3 shows to one final showdown imagine the reaction of fans watching an episode and they come in 3 different different sections I would be like OMG Rick and Michone standing across the street from Daryl and carol then from the east Maggie appears that would be good way to end a episode
Ihuuuuuu
MUAHAHA NEW EDITS 🤭🤭🤭
Yes Rick is back!!! So excited for Walking Dead The Ones Who Live :)
Everyone look it's Rick...
Deveria ter saído antes, já passou a hype. Acho que ninguém quer ver the walking dead agora. Demorou muito pra sair, infelizmente. Eu tenho só curiosidade de saber o que aconteceu com o Rick, mas assistir a série não.
1:34 THEIR USING THE GAS FROM WORLD BEYOND THAT THEY USED TO TAKE OUT THE COLLEGE CAMPUS
the walking dead disini kalau dikilas balik sangat berubah drastis sinematografinya, semakin bny menggunakan efek dibanding eps pertamany dlm season pertama, saya malah jadi kangen era the walking dead season 1 😂
Reminds me of a mixture of the later Resident Evil movies
THIS SHIT GONNA BE CARZY.
OH HELL YES!!
❤😊
John Locke is back from the island! 😮
1:41  He’s gonna take off his helmet and say  *FOAP!* *FOAP*
Murder Beard Vs John Lock This is gonna be awesome.
I DAMN NEAR CRIED WATCHING THIS !!!!!    I DID CRY WATCHING THIS!!!!!!!   HAPPY TEARS !!!  THANK U FOR GIVING US WHAT WE ASKED FOR !!!!!!!!!!!!
Who’s been cutting the grass ?!
Rip to UK audiences
Ni se imaginan lo mucho que he esperado esto, VUELVE RICK 😍😍😍😍
damh, where his left arm?
Looks really good! Let's hope it's worth the wait!
The walking dead message probably went over a lot of delusional people's heads 2:04 .
damn damn damn... go go go
Who cares 😂 the biggest fall off in TV history.
LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOO
Waiting...
This made me feel like taking up TWD again after that season Rick 'died'..
brilliant how they can fabricate new body armour for a whole army
It's John Locke
daaamn
🔥🔥🔥
Philly 🎉
The man, the myth, the legend, Ricky Dicky Doo Dah Grimes returns.
This looks so good.
THIS SHOW LOOKS AMAZING!!! IT'S LITERALLY GOING TO BE THE BEST!!! AHHHHH!!!!
Rick = TWD !
looking like season 5 rick, R.I.P season 9 rick with buzz cut grey hair
Is THAT JOHN LOCKE??? Holy fuck this is gonna be good!!!
When you see the crm military lined up..Rick is in the second row, just off centre...the woman who thanks him is next to him
Genuinely looks amazing
looks amazing, one concern: is all of this possible in 6 episodes ? :D hopefully it doesn't feel rushed
John Locke!!
Been watching walking dead since the start so I’m the the biggest fan than all others
TWD is Back! 😂
This is at least interesting. I see the budget on the screen, but I’m afraid that these could be the most interesting shots of the entire project...
This one is FIRE, but I also hope for a What If Carl Lived spinoff series
God, I hope this means Corey Hawkins will come back to this too....
Hope this redeems season 10 and 11. Those were the worst by far.
Okay , the budgets up on this one boys
Whe will series end tired of this sh!t
goofy ahh CGI
Quá Hay Luôn Ạ Chúc Kênh Phát Triển Tốt @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@&&@@&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&)))))))))))))))))))
I'm Rick Grimes and I'm back
Allahım hemen çıksın
This show doesn't make any sense anymore
🤙!
OMG OMG
Can't wait! I've been itching for my Walking Dead fix. Looks awesome!!
S12?
Who tf is Nat
Caraca!!! John Locke (entendedores entenderão) com Rick e Micchone!
Peak is back 🫶😎 Good to see you officer friendly
They’re dropping napalm in the streets
Rick is TWD’s cash cow now. Look at the views. It’s used to be Daryl 10 years ago. Crazy
Its never over for the walking dead.
That Michonne ending was incredible. Could that be the first time she see's Rick?
Super👍👍
Rick grimes turkey fans club
John Locke ❤️
Oh fuck man...done dis show now nha
A minute of silence in honor of all loyal fans who didn't live to see this legendary moment.
it's good to see john locke too
OMGGGGGG ITS PERFECT FOR MY BIRTHDAY
What is the name of the background music?
We better get a whole season of rick reuniting with everyone back home lmao , rip Rosita who didn’t make it just at the end
Why are they waiting so long lol this is honesty disrespectful...
This feels like the actual ending to the main show
This ain't the walking dead anymore lol...
RED AXX GRIMES
Rick is about to burn that whole damn place to the ground.
cringe, this is not what twd should be about
Definitivamente la vere
I still don't see the point if it's "limited" series. I really want a Rick/Daryl reunion and I doubt we get it. Heck I'd even settle with a Judith reunion but there timeline is all wacky now.
QUE LINDOSSSS❤❤❤
JOHN LOCKE!!!!
Только не говорите, что они снова разрушат норм работающую общину и потом просто свалят)
Letsss gooooooooooooooooooooo
Anybody else notice the scene at 1:14 is the same scene from Atlanta getting bombed
wow
Nice!
The fact it says “New Series” and not “Limited Series” implies there’s gonna be more than just one season. I could never imagine Rick and the CRM’s story being resolved in just 6 episodes tbh. Especially since the FTWD ending implied that Morgan is going to meet Rick again
Lesley Ann Brand is acting, I hope they won't ruin her character!! Mazikeen needs to kill some zombies and have qualities of a MAIN character.
I hope they won't ruin it. CRM theme has the most potential in TWD Universe history. This needs bombs, a lot of action, suspense, drama, a lot!!! And I hope they connect with Commonwealth, FTWD .
GODOOO, RICK SI RIVEDEEEE!!!!!!
What a HYPE bro!
The CRM seem way more controlled and bigger than what the commonwealth was, I think the only way Rick escapes them is if all our people meet on the same path to save him, all the spin offs have to link up
idgaf about dead city or daryl, DIS THE ONE I'M WATCHING RIGHT HERE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Learn to make a trialer losers. I wish Walking Dead ended with it's season 11. With that Rick too. You are just trying to milk out the maximum from these characters and making them horrible 🥲
I am a grown ass man. Said to myself not to be hyped again for a TWD Season. Now for a TWD show. Yet I am sitting here, hyped like a small kid! Damn I am so looking forward, counting days to this!  I really hope they will let meet Rick an Daryl! If not in this spinOf, where then? Damn!
Shame it's not being shown in the UK
they’re finally back. 🥲
new 11 seasons
Wird das eine Serie oder ein Film wie damals angekündigt?
Missing other cast of the show specially Daryl and Judith
Yess super excited for this comeback  ☠
Уххх! Дух захватило. Как же я скучал по Рику
In the last scene you can see micchone talking to something, she's either looking at something like a sunset or a beautiful building etc.., orrr it could be rick
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Черная независимая женщина какое же прекрасное будущее несет нам Америка, а рик так на заднем плане попукивает. Продолжайте в том же духе и от вашего гейливуда нечего не останется)
I'm rewatching the TWD seasons, hoping it will finish to the day the 1st episode is released. I'm excited to the bones!
CRYING SCREAMING THROWING UP!!!!! 45 DAYS LEFT
Swear to god if Beale (Terry O Quinn) say to him it is Rick's destiny to be in CRM i am going to lose my sht🤣🤣🤣If u seen Lost tv show u know what i am talking about😂🤣😂😂🤣😂
Is that Daniel from fear the walking dead and 0.57?
This looks insane
Oh my gosh I CAN'T WAIT!!!
This is gonna be crazy man 🔥
More action/ thriller/ horror what we need. Plz, make us scare how zombies are terrified. I'm so hype now 🔥
I'm so excited but really, 6 episodes 😭
The man is back - Rick Grimes 👀❤️
Best best best best best
Who's that short guy with the high-pitched voice? I swear I've seen him somewhere before but I don't remember.
milk it jusst stick to the script.t not whole bunch of woke crap.like that land beyond  crap.
Rick and Miahone are back 👍
Brazil
I think Michone's performance was worse than Mr. Dixon. I would rather Daryl and Rick meet than Rick and Michone.
This looks like it has a much different feel and look from the other shows, looks a lot more cinematic. Which is great.
if only clementine showed up
BRO ITS OFFICIAL TRAILER AND YOUR USING MICHONNE PHOTO FOR THUMBNAIL ARR YOU FKIJG KIDDING US
Thanks for the name of the best films
0:40 what is that
It looks waaayyyy more awesome than any Hollywood movies. And by watching this I'm kinda worried that Rick gonna come to Alexandria anytime soon.
Just end this series it's blatant money laundering at this point. Show was ruined and changed everything
It's been long time coming... enough to make a grown man cry 😢🥹
this new cod trailer looks amazing! keep it up activision!
😩😩I’m screaming
we been waiting
This stupid show is still going on.
brooo how tf did andrew lincon even got that accent in the 1st place LIKE WTF bros speaking like shane 1:08
Looks like Locke found he’s place after the Island
😍 depuis le temps qu'on attends le retour de Rick et Michonne 😍 j'ai hâtes 🥳
Here me out it was the crm that bombed Atlanta in the beginning 😮😮😮😮
John lock from lost thoughhhhh
Oh my god its John Locke!!!! Yessssssssss!
Idk why but it reminds me of Days gone. Very nice
This show is still going on? Holy shit. You guys are some marks
Это просто шедевр,ждём...
This looks like a full on movie
Насколько же это хорошо выглядит
Can’t wait
TWD is such a cash whore. I stopped watching this shit show after mid season 5. It became all talking little action. Like 50 min talking then action in last 10 min then episode ends. Also I knew they’d bring Rick back to keep the series relevant. 🤣
at 1:14 its a scene from the first episodes when remember the fallen by lorie or shane ^^ why make this in ? i think we will know :D
Michonne looks like Pennywise in the last thumbnail 🤡
BACK 4 BLOOOOOOOOOOD‼️‼️‼️
I think Rick lost his left arm
i cant wait to never see this in the UK like the other series, cant wait for it to be spoiled for everyone in Europe, so excited for that
Oh so thats where the remenants of the military ended up. Couldve used those apaches at the start of the outbreak
With love, from India ❤
Literally can't wait
that's the guy from lost 😮
That last soldier has to be Rick for sure! 😍
If CRM soldiers play stupid and act dumb in the show we all know it's just bad writing. Like look at the Commonwealth soldiers I fucking cringe in some parts. But the overall trailer looks good!
MACHETE RICK AND KATANA MICHONNE.🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 GOATED DUO, by the way was that the ship from twd game,final season??, The exploding one?
Murder jacket Rick is back
love to see john locke 😄
Ngl If you think a little hes back where he started everything looking for his wife and child
I need a Daryl and Rick reunion
Bro doesn’t know he got a son
who else is hyped for this?
Just watching because RICK is back! Rick is the main character he is THE WALKING DEAD!
Let's fucking goooooo Rick is finally back!!
My big homie Rick is back
Great, but when do we get the new walking dead shows in the UK?
HYPE
Daryl in the end
Walking dead. I don’t see any Chinese 🇨🇳 here!! 🧐🧐🤨🤨
Why do I have a feeling that this is going to be more of a michonne story where she's the action star and Rick is just going to be the soy prisoner so to speak? Maybe I'm wrong, but knowing Hollywood...🤨
THE RED MACHETE RETURNS!!!!!
No negan no party
lol that CGI looks dodgey afff
Heck,this better be of higher quality writing than the FTWD
LETS GOOOOOOOO!!!!! LETS 🤬 GOOOOO!!!! FOR CRYING OUT LOUD, ITS ABOUT TIME!!! 😂🤣🤣
This trailer gives me goosebumps
Yoooo what I missed
Well this looks stupid
4 episodes of where is he, then a 6 months break, then return and wont see them get back together till last episode, and then 1 year break with only 7 episodes for season 2, rinse repeat.
The crossover is comming. Daniel has appeared in the trailer. And maybe in think that  in the final has appeared Al or Madisson
Michonne, using and slashing a zombies head is so cool.!..
Can't wait. Wish Rick has never left the show
I wish Rick and his beloved murder jacket would reunite once again :(
RICK❤❤❤
This took a little bit of the sting away of hearing that Nick Saban retired today.. watching Saban retire as an Alabama fan is like watching Rick Grimes die
AMAZING!
I am waiting!
Why are you here ? RICK : THE WRIGHTERS KILLED OFF EVERYONE WE LOVED ,EVERONE I LOVED $0 WE ARE THE ONES WHO LIVED .nuff said lol can't wait
Who is still watching this shit
Morgan meets Rick ❤
I'm still holding on Rick
"look in my eyes, Sir. You tell me."  Damn im really excited to see Andrew comeback as Rick
I don't think I've ever been so hyped for anything, this is surreal!
While watching this trailer and remembering back The Walking Dead makes me go crazy ! How far this has come is itself Insane...
The Rick Grime empire will rise again
Looks like garbage to me 😢
The last clip is 100% daryl!!!
Bru why tf does that dude have a zesty ass voice
Amazing!
I wonder if Rick still remembers biting joes throat out
This better be good
2 my most favorite things on this planet, walking dead and fucking apaches
That shot at the end of the soldier walking towards the camera is someone important.. maybe Rick? Kinda has his little swag walk lol
Bro I have amc on My television but I Don t have darly Dixon I have just ftwd and its Always Like that so pls help I am croatian
LETS FUCKING GOOOO!!!!!!11 THIS IS GONNA BE CRAZY I CAN TELL U RN
John Lock !!!!!!!!!!yeraaaaaahhhhhhhhh
At some point of time, There should be a War b/w Army of CRM and Commonwealth over expanding Territory. Ofcourse in some other Seasons. 🌚
Жду с нетерпением.
this is going to be fun man
Yeh men!! 🎉
this better be good AMC
AH-64 Apache vs Zombie
Goosebumps
Hype for Terry O'Quinn
Thank you very much for making it possible again, I'm looking forward to another cool series like the original, thank you❤
I think that's good, finally I can look away again and the Spaniard fits well together, somehow Bavarian. I'm finally happy to see main characters like this series again
Imagine Shane in the mask 1:39
Yoh that Cape Town accent Jasss
Is Rick's left hand chopped or something? They're not showing his left hand on diff. Frames
C'è anche "John Locke"...
We will be there 🔥🔥💯💯💯
Oh snap!
Me smiling like a rick simp n.n
Finally

Let’s f*cking goooooooooooo
Legends
C'MONNNN CANNAE WAIT ❤🎉
so excited
Lets go my Favorite thing in this world!!!!
my life my rules
Please be available in the UK! Please!!!
Damn , great
lol when will this chit be over with
Nice teeth
So John Locke finally escaped from the island
is he gonna meet judith tho? 🥹
The person at the end seemed like Daryl
The frame in this doesn't match the old walking dead
Sad knowing this will only be 6 episodes
Did we just see rick talking to morgan 👀
I hope they don't milk it out. Michonne and Rick need to be with each other already. ❤
Looks amazing🤩🤩
Let's go baby!!!!
Rick !!!!
Nice to see the CRM armor has finally reached a point where it doesn’t look so goofy.
Rip iron man 😢
Prr!!
i really hope they were able to maintain ricks character while writing it into such a larger story. high hopes tho
Omg yes like yes yes yes. Rickkkk I miss you ❤ ❤❤ ugh. So good to see him again. (Michone and Rick always🤠+🗡️ =🤍)
Damn focking John Locke as the leader of the common wealth, gotta say nice pick man.
rick and dyrl reunion would be the greatest in history if it ever happens
He just want to go home😢😢
Awesome to see Terry O'Quinn on the screen again! Loved him in Lost!
I need an Alexandria reference!!! Morgan Will appear ,mark My Words!!
This one clip is actually from season 1 or 2
we are back guys 🗣️🔥🔥🔥🔥☝🏻☝🏻☝🏻
1:13 Really just threw in Atlanta getting bombed and pretended we wouldn't notice
1:31 Essa cena é fantástica
Love Rick. Love Michonne. Don't like Richonne.
Never thought I’d be jealous of American people until I realised amc+ is U.S exclusive
Just got goose bumps watching this...
we better get a reunion with everyone
Can we all agree we just need a walking dead movie now to reunite everyone?
This took too long, the hype is still there but not as expected.
0:23 Damn Rick's voice changed a lot
1:22 kingbach
Would you like to hear some good news? This is the best news you'll hear. Everyone, including you and me, has sinned and falls short of God's glory (Romans 3:23). And because the wages/punishment of sin is death (Romans 6:23), you are headed for Hell for eternity. But because God loves you, He graciously offers you the gift of Eternal Life through Jesus Christ. Jesus, as God in the flesh, died for your sins on the cross. He took the punishment you deserve, and He rose again on the 3rd day. If you believe this and confess that Christ is Lord, then you are saved (Romans 10:9,10),  and regardless of what you may have done, there is no condemnation for you if you are in Christ Jesus (Romans 8:1). You are saved by what Jesus did on the cross, not what you do. Salvation is simple and free. "For God so loved the world, that He gave His only Begotten Son, that whosoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life."
John Locke
I consider this the 10th season of the walking dead!
The only man that could kill Rick Grimes is Rick Grimes himself
Day Before ?
Who is the guy in the mask?
LETS GO THIS ACTUALLY LOOKS UNREAL RICKS HAIR IS BACK!!!
John locke asking someone why theyre here again
So there is no cure!
OMFG YES!!!!
Yaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhh
🔥
Looks good!
Rick without his son Carl.  I can’t even wrap my head around the fact that this was their story before😢
The Walking Dead IP is the most overmilked thing this century worse than Star Wars
Vreun Român pe aici ? Care avea așteaptă să apară ? 😅
Okay now you have my attention patiently waiting for this
I love this 💩 omg
So Now they're in Palestine, resisting the Israeli bombing? 😂
I can't wait for launched. Come back my daddy Rick in action.
We don’t see ricks left hand the entire trailer 👀
I felt commics were little bit rushed towards the end. Now they have a chance to make this the biggest thing in the history of tv. All the characters returning to fight the ultimate villain. I hope this series not only give importance to Rick and mishone but also to CRM, because what's the fine if villan isn't powerful. I want atleast big characters to die early to raise the stakes
Looks pretty good and I'm excited. Dead City has been decent so far and Daryl Dixon is great, I just hope they don't write the CRM like they did in World Beyond and Fear cause they were woefully inadequate.
can they please not meet in the last episode weve waited too long for this and we cant wait any longer.
wait so its a series? i guess i thought i might be a movie, glad to see this tho tbh
🔥🔥🔥 the greatest character arc is returning... The hype is real.
amc não erre nessa série por favor!!!
Ricky Dicky Doodah Grimes Is back
I CANT WAITT
After all these years, some decent pay off to the series. And that's some impressive air power the CRM has up their sleeves.🙌🙌
Why did they reuse footage from season 2 ep 5 of the walking dead? at 1:14
Oh come on!!!! This looks soooo good!! We need seasons!! Gonna be huge
This is so cool. Omg
Ok, I'm REALLY curious to see why they got michonne fighting with a stick of rebar 🤔🤔🤨🤨
This looks too good to be true! Just wish TWD would go back to that grainy look though. Like this show would look even better with that grainy look and feel more like twd
Just hoping they could reunite with Daryl
Can't wait to see Rick and Negan living in the same neighbourhood
Why does it feel like Rick lost his left hand
The boy can't stay clean for more than 15 minutes. Always covered in blood 😂❤
I can’t wait !! ❤🏹🎺🪘💃🏼
🤩🤩
High production, same b-rate writing.
Rick is back!😮😮
History is finna be made. 💯
Look my eyes, and Tell me: "Tu tá de brinqueichu idimim cara?". Que medo! Eu tenho fobia de zumbi. Parece a quantia de gente que persegue a raluca soque menor.
These mfers got apache? What kinda apocalypse is this😂 Anyway can’t wait, is gonna be lit
If machone is going north they could introduce casey from twd saints and sinners, because he went north at the end of the game. You guys also confirmed the two to be in the same universe, and it would be super cool to see. Also since he used to be national guard he could have been added to the army that is shown in the trailer. Anyways me and my homies are super pumped to see this show.
LETS FUCKING GOOOOOO!!!! Rick Grimes is back!!!!!
Anyone else get the “ where’s Rick” hoodie from TWD website 😍
I know that paid Rick a hefty bag to do this series and provide the fans with the appropriate closure.
Damn, production value is waay up. This seems more like a trailer for a big budget movie than it does a miniseries for TV lol
Que gran día para estar vivo
Wow 😳😳 definitivamente el CRM es brutal!! Es el ejército más fuerte de todo the walking dead!! El comonwealth será destruido muy rápido!! jajaja vamos CRM!!!!🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 yá que sea febrero
Welcome home rick
Shouldn't most zombies have decayed by now? How are there still giant horses?
I am ready and not ready at the same time because I know i'm going to be sad when its over.
Is the one shot at night of a city blowing up Atlanta from the original show?
This gives the first episode ATLANTA vibes!!
Hooray we got our first trans person in The walking Dead. This show is going to be garbage
I don't know... I hear Nebraska's nice.
damn that looks good
bien
WOW
Legit looks like it could be a movie, can't wait
I'm so excited  for this series 😍 🙌
🔥🔥🔥
I...............CAN'T...............WAIT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Oh my god finally ❤
That had to be the best trailer having to do with TWD or other zombie movies or shows
Hype
Looks cheap
This looks like a movie jesus fucking christ this is a huge step up of a quality
They’re definitely hiding that left hand.
I’m excited but I am worried. Fear Season 8 had good trailers but was awful trash. Daryl spin off same thing, but was mediocre show.  I’m excited. Just hope the writing, and supporting cast is good.
Please give these two characters a beautiful ending to their development 🙏
WIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII
This is dumb but how the fuck do they have so much fuel let alone aviation fuel that long after. That shit is HARD to make even today let alone post apocalyptic like… they have drill teams and then refineries still functioning with new drill sites they secure? Lol
Final boss of the game CRM
I'm am practically leaping out of my chair in happiness with the anticipation of this premiere. I don't want my winter seasonal layoff to end quickly but I can't hardly wait for the end of February. I might have to take some zanax prior to the premiere. 😆
Rick finally gonna get bit , 20 Szns later , he loses a hand ☠️☠️😫
Ay caramba
what a downfall ...
I don't think you understand the magnitude of the situation. We're gonna se Rick Motherf*ckin Grimes coming back in less than 2 months.
Omg Can't wait to see Rick Grimes once again 😁😁
This trailer did not disappoint im hyped
WE NEED CARL
I love how AMC fucked up the best show ever
OMG
mofos went from riding horses and wagons to full blown black hawk choppers with rocket launchers and an entire modernized army 😂
I swear it sounds like Michonne is yelling Daryl before the bomb goes off
Oh shit😳.. I have a lot to catch up on. My TWD hiatus is off
What type of mom leaves her kids behind during a walker apocalypse to find a man she watched get blown to pieces? Michonne thats who the bad ass katana wielder!!
I LITERALLY CANNOT WAIT... I'm glad we got Dead City and Daryl's Series but these we're the main characters for the majority of the show until Rick disappeared.    Please be more than a 6-8 episode series... We miss the 12-16 Episode Season days, make em great again...  Man, i remember how creepy the Common Wealth was, that was an amazing plot... Also when the walkers started whispering , and tried to stab one someone in the graveyard at night, or how about when they climbed the wooden post to get away from the crawlers and one climbed up there... Then we learned about the Alpha, oh the times... i binged the he** out of TWD lol. But i can't wait for Rick's return , its gonna be epic. if they all somehow met back up , maggie negan rick and michonne i think that'd be something fans would love.
Rick and John Locke..ok
The goat is back baby!
Let's go it comes out on my birthday 🥳🎂
Since they're the ones who took Heath all the time ago, I'm hoping we see him in this series.
i just want it to be good
Yesssss 🤯👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
❤❤❤❤
I'm soooo excited!
Resident Evil
Trailer made me feel like I was watching Season 1 again. Officer Rick Grimes is back.
Waiting for Daryl ❤
That last soilder looks sick ass hell!! I wonder who it is!? I have a feeling it's either Rick or a returning character that is a straight up badass!!
💜💜💜
rick grimes fortnite griddy

HE DID LOSE A ARM WHYYY
GOOSEBUMPS!!!!!!!
Anyone else feeling like the masked solider at the end is Morgan
Kinda sad how they completely trashed FTWD.
Please stop making these spin offs. Your showrunner ruined the series. These shows have no plot and lack the depth you want. Dug yourself a hole that you’ll always keep digging.
I'm so fucking excited
Took like 16 years but finally we get a Rick movie 😂
I've waited a long time for this moment! I CAN'T EVEN BELIEVE!!!!!
Is that mother fucking JOHN LOCKE (TERRY O'QUINN)!!
Nobody:   TWD Characters: “tHe wOrLd iS oUrS!”
Too many twd movies 😅
This! This is the walking dead!
Cant wait to see this. Rick you are back and find Simone sooner than later. Have waited along time for this.
You can tell he has no hand
Shieeeeee 🔥🤯
I think it's gonna be CRM vs Commonwealth
NAHH THIS TRAILER LOOKS CRAZYY
I haven't seen the last 2 seasons of TWD  FTWD & TWD WB, but I plan to see TWD TOWL
Just imagine if Rick gets his Murder Jacket back.
damn that trailer❤
The Original The face of TWD The 🐐
Why does he look younger than he did in his last szn of twd
I wonder if he only has the right hand
Now this looks like sum GOOOD shii
In my head, it is still Rick, Andrea and Carl - just like the comics
Oh baby, we are so back!
Either they just teasing us really hard or Rick definitely lost his hand.
lets go!!! notice they never show ricks other hand, makes me wonder.
Let’s gooooooooooo
Looks cool but its going to be a bunch of WOKE nonsense that forgets how the walking dead started.
Yes … Rick is back .. 2024 just got lit 🔥
So Hype Fr 🔥
Movie or otherwise this is gonna be just what Dr Jenner Ordered! Hahah You don't "take a bite outta Grimes..." Grimes takes a bite outta YOU!
1:13 They did re use that one scene from the original TWD when the outbreak first started and they were dropping bombs, that Shane and Lori were looking at.
Is this the beginning of the end for the Walking Dead or will it be the start of an entirely new saga? Not much longer until we find out. All I know is that TWD is ALIVE and better than ever. Dead City and Daryl Dixon have been amazing and now I can only hope for the same for The Ones Who Live. I'm both excited and nervous because I don't want this to be the end for Rick or Michonne.  I've been here since the season 1 premiere all the way back on Halloween night 2010. It's been a long road, but I'm ready for whatever happens next.   "Hold it to your heart. It's true. Forever. We're the ones who live."
Literal chills
This is going to be amazing
I felt this in my heart ❤ Rick is the franchise for me!
😢 always want to participate even as Extra
This is basically season 12 of the show.
Can't wait
Fuck ? You got  that far  amc ?
Man I wish Carl was a part of this, killing him off was about the worst decision they ever made on this show. He should still be there. Damn it. Still pumped though to see Rick and Michonne again! I wonder where Morgan is going to tie in since he left near the end of Fear The Walking Dead and radioed Rick that he was going to come looking for him. Can't wait to see that especially since Morgan was with Rick at the very beginning in the first season!
I was of the mind that it's simply been too long but Daryl's series changed my mind. I really liked it and have high hopes for this series too!
Jesus answered, “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me - John 14:6. I felt led to share this with you all 🥰🫶🏾
Still mad that glen died !
Is that John Locke?!?!?!
I left the Walking Dead when Rick did. And now I’m back.
They better not sell us some BS!
Had a teacher in high school who would be so happy to see this. I remember the day we talked about 9x05 like it was yesterday
I am so hyped.
I mean it looks cool but its too much to be considered The Walking Dead
I don’t understand how the walking dead ended yet all these shows about the major characters of the walking dead are coming out. 😂
isnt 1:14 the atlanta bombing?
ok ok
you tell me… yeah i felt tht one
oh he's going to kill
Oh god the more I want it to be February the longer AMC is dragging out the premier of this show
I almost forgot that Rick doesn’t know about RJ. He’s going to be shocked to find out he has a son back home.
His left hand is gone.
Please dubbed in Hindi league's❤
2023 GTA 6 2024 RICK GRIMES TWD  2025 AREA 51
John locke from lost in twd😮
That shit looks good
Salazar?
Humanity after the fall
is it me or did he lose the cowboy accent
Crazy travel story on my channel!
You can see Rick in the line up with Beales army to the left of thorn. (2nd row to the front) if you zoom in at 0:54 seconds in
😊😊😊😊
has ANYBODY NOTICED the Atlanta bombing SCENE from SEASON 1???
Lets be real who ever plays mitchone, we will get wayyyyyyyy more scenes of her than rick as andrew is way more expensive.
I need negan and rick reuniting
live music mix streaming now on my channel! jazz, indie, house, mixed with poetry, storytime, and more! every wednesday & sunday 7-10pm New York time 🫶🏿🎶🥂
LET’S GO!!! The heroic badass❤ of TWD is finally returning.. and he’s still looking for his family!! 🔥🪓🔪🧨
Yup our speculations are true.. He lost his left hand.. 1:00.. Slow it down
Finally.
This looks great! I hope there is more to the story! A movie would be awesome! I would love to resolution to the Grimes story. Maybe a CRM/Commonwealth war?
I can't wait for this one love them both
So it was them who dropped the napalms on Atlanta.
Fine. I’ll rewatch the whole thing all over again
I absolutely can’t wait for this show wish it was coming sooner.
CANT WAIT!!!!!!!!!
John freakin Locke. Let’s go, baby 😤😤
Look bad
About time!
0:57 That's Bill from the Left for Dead video game. HAHA
Will Morgan meets rick?
Rick, daryl and judith reunion would be top tier ngl but im exited
Meh
Rick and Michonne are going to reunite with their children and they’re all going to live happily ever after. No one can convince me otherwise. Why title the show “The Ones Who Live” and have that not play out? Wouldn’t make any sense.
it sure has been too damn long...
So here you were putting the entire twd budget
A trailer for a trailer??
He's coming Back😍🔥❤️‍🔥
I stopped watching an episode or two after rick was gone from The Walking Dead.  I'm so far behind I have no idea what's going on and I'm not sure I feel like finishing the rest of the seasons of TWD
Oh boy, TWD was better off ending at Season 3.
Wait Ricks alive?
Finally a real trailer!!
Another thing, the CGI looks much much better, definitely looks like a $13 mil/espisode.
Who is under that helicopter helmet? Althea’s girlfriend or maybe Althea?  I just hope we get a good explanation why they took Rick and why they needed to keep him.
This look like a movie… this can’t be a tv series show
I’m so excited for this!! 👏🏼👏🏼🚁🚁🚁🧟‍♂️🧟‍♂️
I’m sorry but Rick IS walking dead. Rick and Shawn made the entire show. Removing both was the end of WD
I still blame amc for not having a better plan for the original series.
This actually loooks 🔥, budget looks WAY higher than it’s ever been for a walking dead project
welp they clearly didnt get a bigger budget because those special effects from the helicopter looked like absolute shit. If they told me they filmed that shot back in 2012 I would have believed you. Same goes for the flaming zombie.....all these spin off shows are just sad. They just needed to let the show die and instead we get a bunch of C+ zombie drama. Its also a sad reminder that these actors really dont get much work outside. Andrew Lincoln has literally been in 6 other things since 2010 outside the Walking Dead. Same with Chandler Riggs; At least Danai Gurira gets that Marvel money lol
This trailer is literally 🔥
If rick loses his hand I will be super fukin pissed!!!
I really hope the ending is them returning to Judith and RJ alive. After everything Rick has lost it would be a good conclusion to see him able to start again with his family.
I like
It's been a long time coming 😢 and I'M SO EXCITED!!!!!!!!😱😱
Espero con ansias el estreno
As excited as I am, I can't help but wish Carl was a part of this spinoff.
nah
Acho que não foi só eu, mas esse olhar do Rick pro major general Beale lembrou muito o olhar do Nick em Fear 💥💥💥⚡⚡⚡
An I'm a fan saying that
Looks sooo good!
Looks so damn boring to be honest
This just looks boring. About 8 years too late.
coming on my birthday awesome birthday gift❤
Can’t wait!!!
PEEEAAK
CRM is Fucked
We need to get more of Rick Grimes in the trailer❤
Can’t wait to have an episode entirely with the cowboy hat guy to see why he is there, Can’t wait to have an episode entirely with the woman who said Rick taught her that she can’t escape.. can’t wait to see why she’s there or her story and family, Can’t wait to have episodes of the military guy to see what his whole backstory is and why he’s the way he is… can’t wait for 32 min commercials and finally, can’t wait for all the talking dead episodes where that cheerleader Chris Hardwick doesn’t criticize anything whatsoever when he recaps the show
Welcome back this is great
Murder Jacket Rick is back.
1:14 is that the bombing of Atlanta?? If so, I am deeply intrigued to know how this ties into the CRM cause holy hell
This looks fucking dope.
This looks soooo good!!! Let's goooooo!!!!!
Am im the only one who misses the original group Glenn ,Tdog ,Dayle,Shane, Andrea,Carol, Daryl Lori,carol ,rick ,
Oh My GOD! Jonh Locke with Rick Grimes
Anyone else recognise lock from lost is the general or old man Rick is talking to.
Wow🔥🔥🔥
I've been following this movie since 2012 and I'm still with it. This movie is like a new life
OMFG
Not even a teaser of them finally seeing each other after all this time!!
Man, the show looks drastically different when not shot on film. While I love the clarity and fluidity of the picture, I really liked the 16mm film they used before the final 30 episodes of the original series.
U called Terry O'Quinn (aka Peter Watts from Chris Carter's Millennium)  Good call ;-)
Rick’s hand ????
Man...I'm hoping the show looks better than this trailer. Rick and Michonne deserve the best spinoff, and so far...idk. I really wish the theatrical plan wouldn't have fell through.
ngl trailer made me cry
Bro no way they got Locke from lost bro I’m so hyped 💀
Is that morgan at 1:19
If there was a version of the future where working, helpful concepts last, we won't get ripped by governments, and save our families it all would be accomplished with Amazons AWT77K
Getting my hopes back with Amazons AWT77K who is joining the crew?
Most try to block any mentions and words on Amazons AWT77K but the community is stronger and we can actually really help humans in this case
I want that most people have some idea on Amazons AWT77K and why 2024 is gonna change everything for us to a better way if we are part of their best move since creation
Yeeeeeesss!! So excited. That guy with Michone is giving me good vibes already. He's gonna be good. This was a really good trailer
Damn I didn’t expect the Fortnite Battle Bus in the end
*”Look in my eyes, sir…. You tell me.”* 😈
❤
1:08 i wish they used this shot for the thumbnail
THE GOAT IS BACKKKKKK
🔝🔝🔝
I am so bummed that some of our fav characters from the original show won't be able to see Rick's return!
i can tell that amc the twats arent gonna make a meet up with the characters happen. whatever.
We can be saved this year with Amazons AWT77K having the right step at the right time, believe fellas
For a long time they planned Amazons AWT77K and obviously nothing comes close
Would not be surprised if in a few weeks everyone and their dogs will talk about Amazons AWT77K as biggest accomplishment of our lifetime
Trailers usually have a kiss included in the action but they are obviously going to withhold that!
Dead City was great, Darryl Dixon was alright, this looks amazing! Hope it lives to the hype!
This year is gonna be fire with Amazons AWT77K being the light of hope for so many, mark my words this is what the world leaders try to hide from ya, the ability to care for yourself and for your family
This looks f****** epic
Locke from Lost is crazy
fa, mirá ese trailer, loco. Es  cine
This is gonna be some woke trash
The day Rick and Daryl meet again I’ll be the happiest
Welcome to the true finale of the walking dead vers guys, it looks like its going to be one hell of a season
The King has returned 🤴
"My wife is my choice. My daughter is my choice." 😭😭😭😭😭 Still winning with my favorite pairing after all these years
Didn't expect to see Rick Grimes talking to John Locke lol
unnecessary
This looks incredible.
Definitely Morgan at the end
They stretching this damn shit
Ga sabar liat nya
Looks like the CRM is more powerful than we expected, and we can see that they where preparing for the apocalipse before civilization collapsed. I think the people who creat the CRM saw that the misterious viruse happening in the country and the world was never going to be stopped and they obviously so far they know about the new virants across the country and the world. So looks like no matter how to stop the CRM, they will do everything to be the only dominant force in the country. We also saw the deadly gas that they were deploying, i thought that was stopped in "world beyond".
The best series I ever watched , right here !
this will be the best spin off.
TRAILER DROP ON MY BIRTHDAY !! 😍😍
CANNOT... FREAKING... WAIT!!!!!!!!
My king is back
Hell yeah this shit looks amazing!!!!
OMFGGGGGGGG
the ending shot is michone finally seeing rick in a helichopter
Man no matter what people say, all the haters, all the naysayers.  It’s literally one of the best tv series ever made, the entire series and spin offs are 🔥 can’t wait for this.
i'm so happy to see Rick back he is the soul of the walking dead and see Michonne back again it's gonna be fantastic these two deserve a happy ending i hope Rick reunites with daryl, carol, maggie and the rest of his family also see his reaction of how Negan changed
Walking dead all timeline  Fear walking dead ???
This actually looks incredible. The other spinoffs havent been bad but nothing really amazing. This is the end of TWD I want.
I can’t wait
EVERY WD spin off has been shit so far… PLEASE BE GOOD, PLEASE
I stopped watching TWD after Glen's death, is it worth returning and watching it all and the spin-offs too? This trailer reminded me how much I used to love this show.
🔥🔥
It looks so weird not being on film
is it gonna have 6 eps like the other two shows?
This looks awesome and is better than perfect if someone focuses in the trailer he will see Atlanta gencide maybe flash back imagine the army planes in the TWD universe and traveling between cities and maybe we can Madison or Morgan for sure and finally I think they will show us how the virus spread I hope to see that.
Can't wait for this.
De las series que más he esperado en mi vida 🔥
Wild that they are just now making Season 10 of the Walking Dead! They didn't even finish the ninth one, but... Hey, i'm not complaining!
My Mum Is A Big Fan Of TWD So SHE WILL BE HAPPY TO SEE THIS
hüseyin mi lan o valla hüseyin valla hüseyin BABA GELİYOOOO BABAAAAAA
This feels like an ending for the story I wonder if the walkers are going to be eradicated there’s military in this one
Looks amazing I love the budget on this!
THE TV EVENT OF 2024 LETS EFFING GO!
General Beale looked into the eyes of a man who will do whatever it takes to get back to his family!!! Daryl Dixon and Dead City were great, i cannot wait for this!!!
JOHN LOCKE HAS APPEARED
Esto ya se volvio un verdadero Churro. Despues de la Temporada 6 y 7 mas o menos todo se volvio basura.
Long hair Rick is back !
Why has the last couple of spin offs been so much better than the actual show?  Hopefully this continues the trend.
Hell yeaa!!!
You know it will gonna b good when John Locke in it ❤️
Shits Heavy
This looks bad. Where was the movie we were told we would have
THE GOAT IS BACK!!!!!!!!!!  LETS FUCKING GOOOO
My excitement of their return, is matched by the anxiety of the fact Rick doesn't know about the whisperers and what was lost in his absence
This looks epic
the GOAT is back.
Holy shit terry o Quinn from two of my all time favourite shows (lost and patriot) is in this! He’s just wonderful! Like I wasn’t hyped already. Who was the soldier with the helmet on at the end? It felt important?
Meh
Nobody cares😅
Is it the CRM the one we saw on season2 where helicopters bombed the city or its just another scene
*Seeing Rick scream and cry again like he always do is going to be nostalgic asf...*
WE STILL DIDNT SEE HIS RIGHT HAND!
Como eu amo esses personagens
Its amazing how many low quality spinoffs can spawn from one solid season of tv show. Sure there were alright and even good episodes sprinkled through TWD, but i can say with all certainty that the juice aint worth the squeeze.
Wtf is John Locke from Lost doing in there?😍
So, the world has gone to sh*ts with limited resources, how are the soldiers manage to have matching "fancy uniforms and armors" (0:52) as if clothing factories are still around churning fancy uniforms? 😂
John locke and Rick Grimes?! 🤯🤯
I thought this crappy show was over 😅
Finally
"Dont tell me what I cant do" - John Locke (LOST)
Que locura va a ser esto!!!!! Lo espero con ansias.
They got the master chief looking uniform.
ริค
Andrew Lincoln is back just like Draymond Green!
How can they have such customized military equipment if the world was broken down, what, 15 years prior? Everything that hasn't decayed into uselessness should be stuck in 2010.
Looking forward to this new series! Recently, I discovered the Walking Dead comic books recently, and love them. Highly recommend for any fans of the show!
The first time someone throws a knife 50ft and sticks a head shot im out.
*Hoohooohhhshityeaaaaaaa!!!!!!!*
It looks fine
FINALLYYYYYY😭🔥🔥🔥🔥
🙏
The hype is so real 💯
THANK YOU FOR CHANGING THE LOGO 😭😭
With this and Rōnin February is gonna be a good month for television
Locke being a bad guy again :)
This show is gonna be my bar of Gold!☺️
I could literally feel the plot armour oozing through the screen.
Just realized Rick doesn't even know about his son 🙀🙀
I just hope its not full of woke horseshit.
This looks more like a movie than a series
I’m honestly excited for this 😭
Whos the guy in the last scene??
Queen Michonne is back!!
1:14 this scene is look a like the bombing the Atlanta way back in Season 1 😮
get this man a ✨murder jacket✨
But whare is dryal dixen 😢😢
Two of my fave characters from TWD, cant wait.
De las mejores series
I’m so sorry John Locke, but don’t tell Rick Grimes what he can’t do 🤪
I can't wait!!!!
Stupid, woke, fake CGI.  Like the real dead, this needs to end. The show died with Carl and spin offs never work and this has the hallmark of the rest.
Robert Kirkman should be ashamed
please let UK be able to access TWD spin offs
RETURN OF THE KING! THE GOAT!!!
I doubt well get the kind of reunion people are hoping for.   I'm thinking it will look more like Rick/Morgan S5 reunion, where they hardly recognize each other.  I expect them to be on opposing sides.
This looks great. Love to see the large scale battles.
i have missed them so much
RICK FUCKING GRIMES
Y E S
Maggie & Negan saga was okay but worse than I thought Darryl saga was actually better than I thought, good  This saga looks like it gonna be crazier than the original... we'll see 🔥
They milking the hell out this show end it already
🔥 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Bring it!
Honestly they should make a season 12 or a spin of with the gang and everyone back together
Aww man, they *still* doing the walking dead?
YESSSSSS👏👏👏
The look in my eyes moment make me feel like we are back to season 5
ya pongan plataformas para latinmoamericaaaa lptm
It give a lot chill ❤❤❤
i feel like after rick gets back to his family he’s gonna act like a general
Rick and Michon were always a TOTALLY unbelievable "couple" with ZERO chemistry, the writers continue to double down on pushing an agenda, this show jumped the shark years ago.
Is that John Lock?
Haven't been this excited for TWD in a long long time ❤❤❤
THE BOMBING OF ATLANTA
this has taken way tooo long
will be awesome !!!! I'm anxious 👏👏
YESSSSSSSS
This gave me absolute chills… this is gonna be a world altering show.
The 2nd gen armor is much worse then the 1st and commonwealth
That’s gotta be daryl. I swear to god it’s gotta be…
It looks Awesome I just wish February 25 would hurry up but I so can’t wait to see !♥️
Great. ANOTHER series not available in the UK 🤷‍♂️
I'm so conflicted about this. They f*d it up in TWD but I'm also still intrested...
The FX hurt the eyes.
I hope this lands. Really liked Darryl Dixon. Didn’t care for the New York one for some reason.
Perfeito dms 😭😭😭
I am actually looking forward to this show. I lost interest in TWD after the Whispers but the last 2 limited series brought me back in.
Please stop making walking dead now it ran its course 5 years ago
1:41 that's Rick in a uniform I can tell from the walk
Papi Rick Regresa ❤
WAIT IT SAYS "NEW SERIES" AND NOT "LIMITED"😮
You should go back to the walking dead And make a 12th season after finishing all spin-offs, so we can see All of them together once again (all who survived) 🙄
tf.. that end gave me chills 😭
Me sinto PRONTA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This looks so fucking good.
PEAKKKK
Does anybody know the song?
These actors will never enjoy any other roles or broaden their range because the fans have had them stuck in these for over 10 years. Though I’ll admit this spin off actually looks decent… they’re milking tf out of this show.
Michonne's smile at the end gave me the same feeling I had in the final 3 mins of S11 when Rick got captured & he smiled at the helicopter😂that's when you know they got some shit cooking in those ZA infected minds of theirs but Rick's smile & death stare is unmatched man this made me even more excited😂these new ppl seem worse than commonwealth somebody head back to Alexandria & pick up Carol she is the only 1 capable of taking out many targets & a herd all at once with a thought & fireworks😂the rest of the group should of been on the mission to save Rick like Rick saved the others so many times
Looks promising. I hope they focus on storytelling rather than Woke BS. Fingers-crossed.
Dammmmnnnnnn I haven’t been this hyped for TWD since Negan personally introduced Lucille to Abraham & Glenn. This looks amazing!!! I can’t wait to Rick freaking Grimes on screen again, & Michonne too! It’s been too long!
My childhood hero was Rick Grimes.
Omg.   I can't wait.  It's about time.  Thank you Andy
BRO A FRIGGIN APACHE?!?!? What next is the CRM gonna have an Iowa Class Battleship or a tank or some
I see the Atlanta bombing scene, I hope they explain the background on the ones who called and created operation cobalt
The new CRM uniforms look sick
They got to stick to the same pattern, find family from strangers and search for survival items every moment they have the chance. It's what Kirkman branded
I can't help but think they've gone the comic route and cut off Rick's left hand. This does look good though. Just hope it's worth the hype.
John Locke! What are you doing? Did the island send you here?
This looks so much better than Dead City and Daryl Dixon combined!
Allot of zombie killing action and better goals then human camp drama , looks good.🤞🤞
I AM Rick Grimes
So amazing! Gooood job amc! 😮
Kinda sad that Rick's original Family is kinda forgotten. The dream sequences in his final episode didn't feature Lori or Carl. And, now, apparently Michonne is his wife, not the deceased Lori.
Who's the person at the end? Maybe Darryl?
The way I know I’m gonna sob when Rick and michonne (and hopefully their kids) reunite
hoping it won't be boring as french daryl tv show also is that a Nazi SS Officer as a zombie? that might explain why these military dudes still have guns and helicopters xD
WE OUT HERE!!!
Looks epic
I think this franchise will live longer. There are just so many things that we still dont know. This spinoff is going to answer allot of the questions, but i dont think this is the end for the Walking Dead Universe
Enough of the walkimg dead. Make a new show AMC enough's enough
Yessssssssss
Yeah nah, excited for the show but with that army size, technology and only 6 episodes, the big reunion we’re all hoping for might take longer than expected as I can’t see them fitting everything into 6 episodes. CANT WAIT THOUGH FR
Who was the soldier at the end?? Maybe someone of the earlier Season?
How can I get a subscription to AMC if I am from Latin America? Can someone tell me how? I'm excited to see the return of Rick and Michonne 🤯.
i actully can't wait, this show will come before 2 days from my birthday .
This is like the older and wiser Rick we was dreaming about in his visions. Except he’s a complete bad ass.
CANT WAITT
Yo Rick still looks hella young..
Wait, he was alive all this time. I thought he died in the series.
😱😱😱😱😱🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
He lost his hand by the looks of it
It’s still so far away
where is ricky
So little love for Pollyanna Mcintosh?  She was kinda meh as Jadis IMO but if you've seen Hap And Leonard S1 you know how good an outright badass she makes.
Can someone tell me if its true that i have been waiting for rick grimes for 5 years now?
1:14 is that the same scene of the Atlanta bombing?
omg, can't wait.  And then a few months later, House of The Dragon season 2.  Bring it all on!
They popped in the bombing of Atlanta scene… more of a backstory with Shane and Lori maybe? That was their scene together 🤷‍♀️
I can't wait for feb 25h, welcome back Rick and Michonne
Don’t tell me Rick lost his hand :(
They saved the best spin off for last
No Rick Grimes No Walking Dead show.
One of the Walking Dead‘s problems was that the budget was too low and it didn’t look that good at times and that’s more a problem with the earlier seasons and I’m so happy that I don’t think the spinoff will have the same problem
OH SHIT!!!!!! I'm so ready!
Someone remind me: Michonne left to find Rick beacuse she knew hes alive??
I have high hopes for this but AMC ruined the entire Walking Dead Franchise. Instead of focusing on spin off shows, they should have put all their efforts into making a satisfying conclusion to the main show. They are copying the MCU formula but they forgot to give their main characters satisfying conclusions.  Instead all we got were mediocre spin offs.
1:33 Nova 6 Hazmat suits now
IT PREMIERES ON MY BDAY LETS GOOO
Holy Shittt, can't wait literally
Michonne smiling at the end. 😭❤
Rick and Jon lock>>>>
the only thing seemed out of place was Nat's voice!
WE ARE SO BACK!!!
1:39 HEATH COMES BACK
RICK❤️❤️❤️❤️
Kind of hard to get excited for this show, when they haven't even bothered showing The Walking Dead City or Daryl Dixon in the UK yet.
1:31 ahora ya sabemos porque rick no vuelve a alexandria 💀💣 Solo mira ese poder del crm  Imagina alexandria luchando contra todo eso  💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
crying 🥹
Wtf is that thing talking to Michonne lol
The last time we got to see Rick on screen I was in 8th grade transitioning to 9th. I’m now 20 years old and graduated. It’s insane after all these years we are finally here!
I came
Wtf is this in TV lore?
I wait with breath that is bated...
bring the glasses... 🏆🎖🏅
Holy. Shit.
This looks like it's going to be a movie.
Why does Rick look different
Are we not going to talk about how cool CRM is looking today?
Meh
You better give em their happy ending after all this time and suffering
Worried that they still haven’t shown ricks left hand but I think they are just trying to bait us
I can't wait 🫷🏻🎉🎉❤❤ love this💖
Yes, Finally!! 🔥
Holy S@@$ that actually looks great
I screamed when Rick came back😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
PEAKKKK
It's hard to imagine a group of execs and creatives getting hyped about that awful title. Hopefully, the show will be better than the title.
🔥🔥🔥
Can't fn wait
We've waited too long, that's enough
That looks like Ricks walk in the CRM uniform ..
I just really need to hear Rick say the F Word a few times😮😁
What about the uk ?
Hyped for this to not be available in the uk
Can’t wait!!
this better be well written
Omg this was awesome
yoooooooooo!!!!!!!!
I didn’t want to believe it but after slowing it down and the brightness up at 1:01 it does look like Rick has a prosthetic arm 😳
Rick Grimes is that you??
please be good!!!
I can’t wait!!!!
Idk why i have a feeling that rick and Michonne wont meet in this movie  The director will just keep the  suspension  between them but they won't actually meet each other unless in the last moment of the movie to keep the hype
Sorry but not looking good
After this they need to do either season 12 of twd or a separate show that brings everyone back to commonwealth
We the ones Live 😎✌️
Goat come back
Now that's a proper trailer!!! Come on 2/25!!! 💜☣️💀🧟‍♀️
MY RICHONNE IS BACK
Omg can't wait
Oh, Rick, how I've missed you.
Dam! This is the best trailer for any spinoff, I have ever seen.  They're back guys.....
I'm so excited ❤
Took them way too long, but now we cannot wait 🙌
Hope it's well written. My biggest fear. And yeah I'm looking at you FTWD😱
I’m ready to be disappointed
Premieres 6 days after my birthday. I am so happy Rick is who I get for my birthday
Couple of years too late unfortunately
My wife is my choice 🥺🥺🥺
JOHN LOCK!
Plz Bring back his Murder Jacket
Rick Grimes and Michonne Hawthorne-Grimes are what got me into TWD in the first place and I'm so glad to see them again, knowing that they'll be together again. Rick and Michonne are like Shaq and Kobe. Separately GOATed but Peak together. The show looks amazing and even if it's not? Andy and Danai have made even the worst writing on TWD come to life and be entertaining. And now they get a whole show to themselves! February 25th can't come soon enough! We're The Ones Who Live.
is that one shot confirming the CRM bombed everything at the start?
This looks genuinely amazing. What the fuck. It's really like they took a movie and put it on TV.
The Return of the King
HOLY SHIT!
I truly believe they cut his hand off They're still not showing it here only his right arm is always seen
Ricky Grimes
WRECK IS BACK
YEASSSSS
LETS GO FEBRUARY
The CRM fucked up the moment they wanted to go against Rick Grimes
Haven’t watched since Carl died not planning on coming back now
SOOOOOOOOOO HYPED 💯💯♥️ THE G.O.A.T. OF TWD IS BAAAAAAACK
👨‍🦽😀
I'm so excited I'm almost crying. Just thinking about the future with Rick reuniting with Daryl gives me chills
It sounds like rick kinda has like a rly slight accent. Maybe Texan????
1:14  is that CRM bombing Atlanta looks like a flashback from when Shane and lori witness this back in season 2?
Can’t believe it’s almost hereeeeee🔥
Everyone talks about the GTA 6 trailer but not this
Can't wait
I watched 2 episodes of the walking dead when its first dropped, havent cared since.  But how many got damn shows do they have now ?
Wow meremang.... X sabau
Amo a Michonne y Rick 🤩🤩🤩
Goosebumps
IM SO FUCKIN HYPE FOR THIS HELL YEAH
i've been really looking forward to this, we've all been. hopefully this will be as enjoyable as daryl dixon's spinoff was.. or better.
I see Rick dying in this series hopefully they are not following the comics because Rick should’ve lost his hand to the governor but didn’t
BROOO RICKS CRM ARMOR LOOKS FIREEEE ✊🏽✊🏽
Their gonna feel real stupid when they find out. Find out what? Their f***ing with the wrong people! -Red Machete Rick
Yeah Rick lost his left arm you can see it in the trailer and I think he loses it after he tried to run away and they do as a punishment
Guarantee they don't reunite until the last episode.
A cohesive Story start to finish to end out the saga? Count me in. As long as it makes more sense than Dexter New Blood that is..
Esperei tanto tempo pra isso , qud agora estou emocionado, por ver este vídeo 🇧🇷
I'm just here for Rick Grimes.
THIS LOOKS SO GOOOOOOOD
I feel proud to have discovered this series in 2020, and it is here in 2024 with this perfect series.
LETS FUCKIN GOOOOO
So.. No box office movie as advertised years ago?  I guess at this point this is the best we can get.
The Man, the Myth, the Legend of the Apocalypse, has returned!!!
So good to see Rick MF Grimes again !!
The military in this looks so badass!
Se fueron bastante a la chucha del cómic pero todavía no la cagan tanto como pa no verla
Wooo! This gave me chills can’t wait!
The 🐐 is back
Wow😮❤
Soooo if I heard and saw right....there are women with beards in this?
Cant wait. The other spin offs were ok but this looks awesome.   They really shouldve kept the show going.  If this was another season it would make the show as big as ever.
.. Somos los que sobrevivimos .. ❤ 🇧🇴
Bro he doesn’t sound like Rick at all . Rip. Even the script doesn’t. “ look at my eyes sir “ when does Rick ever say sir . Ripppppp.
Nice Nice 🎉❤🎉❤
This ain’t the walking dead anymore, this show is something else now 😂
FUCK YEAH! JOHN LOCKE AND GRIMES IN DA SAME SHOW 🔥
Rick vs an entire elite force😂
SOOOOOOOO EXCITED
ALL HAIL THE KING AND QUEEN OF THE WALKING DEAD 👑 🔥
it’s good to see Terry O'Quinn again
HOLY SHI HOLY SHI HOLY SHI
and it's not going to be available in the uk, thanks amc, this one is truly for the fans isn't it
اللععععبببب جون لوك 🔥🔥🔥🔥
No one’s questioning the end of this trailer . Tf she mean by that. Kinda creeped me out tbh.
Rick!!! I'm so excited! 🤩🤩🥰
It's awesome to see Rick again.
HOW MUCH FOR 1 C.R.M vest
Yeeeeess !!!!
The beginning of the end, gives me endgame vibes
WHERE'S THE LEFT HAND OF RIIIIIICK
People who can’t wait for Morgan, Rick mishone , and daryl to reunite again  👇
Am i the only person who is excited 😊 to see Matthew Jeffers on this  new show.   He was damn good doctor on NEW AMSTERDAM ❤
🔥🔥
only here for terry o quinn
Look who's back ❤❤❤ two awesome characters 😎.  Along with two new and familiar faces  ❤❤ TERRY O QUINN and MATTHEW JEFFERS. ❤
Will this be available in the uk
Looks like we get an answer to Portland. Looks definitely like it.
The Walking dead Soundtrack at the end so iconic 🙏
I am rick grimes.
Mal vejo a hora ❤
how did he survive the bridge?
Oh Andy Lincoln HOW WE'VE MISSED YOU- YOU PHENOMENAL HUMAN BEING 🧎 Rick & Michonne are FINALLY BACK- IM ON THE EDGE OF MY SIT,, Terry O'Quinn AND Lesley Ann Brandt- the casting is incredible i cannot wait to devour this show !! 🙏
I still miss Carl and Lori a lot 😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
I can’t believe this show is still alive.
John locke
This looks pretty good....cannot wait! :D
I have a strong feeling we’re going to be disappointed with this show. I don’t think we’ll get to see Rick and michoenn reunion like we think we will. If it is only a 6 episode season I have a strong feeling it will be maybe the 5th or even last episode we’ll get to see them unite. I also feel we’re going to deal with the multiple storylines inbetween episodes like we did with seasons 7 and 8 of TWD. A lot of the show imo is going to be dragged out and boring, but hopefully I’m wrong and will eat most of my words😂
I hope rick dont end up dying or im gonna be pissed
The ultimate power couple reunites Death is coming.   Also hi Jadis good to see you again
Bring Shane Back!
SUPER !
I can't wait
Visually this looks incredibly top tier!! Praying the writing is also peak!!!!!
I could care less about michonne so it’s a shame it’s probably gonna be 70/30 her show but I’m excited for Rick!
Never thought I see John Locke end up coming back alive, Getting his revenge on that Island as an CRM General!
WAS THAT MUSTARD GAS!?
I hope this is good. Would be a waste if not.
ufffffffff
Oh lets go!
Major General Beale doesn’t have any idea who he’s talking to. 0:58.
I'VE NEVER BEEN THAT MUCH HYPED AS I AM RIGHT NOW!
1:13 That shot of the city being bombed is the same one used during season 2 for the Atlanta bombing. Re-used or flashbacks maybe?
So has he got his hand?
Yall still haven’t killed all the damn zombies?!
if the country with most firearms like this, what about others?
Hopefully when Rick comes back neagan will feed him some spaghetti 😊
They better be longer than 1hr
if there was ever a reason to comeback to this, i believe this is it...
LETS MF GOOoooOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!
Damn im so hype right now
Ufff.. ya la quiero ver. Rick es tan guapo 🤩
Holy fuck
Well CGI Could be way better...
How are they still milking this sht?
Ricckkkkkkkkk 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
We Are the Ones Who Live
FLOP NA CERTA.
RICK IS BAAAAAAC 👹🔥
Holy hot shit, this looks amazing!!! So awesome to have Rick back finally!!
ricky diki doda grimes is back?
RIIIICK! Look everybody it’s Rick!
So much story left , 6 episodes are cruel,  give us  atleast 60
John Locke vs Rick grimes
Thank you AMC for scheduling the launch day the day after my birthday🎉
Don't care where's Rick????
Very very excited
dubs
SO EXCITED
Ok ok crazy theory... but what if the pilots heath?
When I see this trailer, I don’t even see walking dead. I see something else completely. The show has definitely gone to new heights and new roots but I just can’t figure out where the hell it’s going. Least it still has fans at least
THIS IS HUGEEEE
Looks like a movie trailer
Hmm… looks weird
I CAN’T WAITT
TWD in 2010: a guy named Rick Grimes looking for his family.  TWD in 2024: 2 women named Michonne and Carol trying to look for their 2 men.
YESSSSSSSSSSS
I'M A BETTER FATHER THAN YOU RICK
0:33 "It's been so long." It pains me to see Michonne crying for Rick's years of absence, during of which our Queen has believed him to be dead after the bridge, and it's still gonna be a some time before she finally finds him,
YES.
we got ghost at the end  💀
Esperei tanto pela volta do rick ,tô muito felizzzzzzzzzz ❤❤❤
Fucking Rick Grimes is back
the black guy from Tales of the walking dead spotted here
DADDYS HOME
This genuinely looks BAD but you best believe I will fucking be there
Wow this looks really bad. Especially the super super bad fire and explosion effects. Looks like a fan movie. Lol^^ So guys wanna squeeze as much money out of it as you can with the lowest amount invested possible, right?
Vai ser épico, quer dizer, lendário
Man thank god for Rick grimes aka Andy Lincoln. Always been a fav actor of mine and I’m sooo glad to see his story continue!! Put your seats in the upright position and fasten your seatbelts it’s about to be a wild ride with Rick on this one. I heard around 10 mil per episode was budget. Can’t wait
حمااااااااااااس😮😮😮😮😮  جينرال بيل هيبة .. ريك القائد واخيرا😢
Can’t wait watching you again Rick 😍
the CRM makes the commonwealth look like a chewtoy
Rick Grimes and John Locke in a show together? I’m sold.
The gang gets infected
Rick Grimes. The best written character in history. simply the best.
I CAN NOT WAIT😱😱😱😱 I've been waiting for this for so long🥹
rick is still rick. thank god that hasnt changed. after all of the cringey shows out nowadays this looks sick
Return of the King 👑
Lord let me live to see it 🎉
Es lo mejor que vi en mis últimos 10 años
Yooooooooo this got me hyped af lol I can't wait this looks like it's gonna be really good
Uh YES!!!!!
😍😍😍😍
This show looks amazing! And looks very expensive!
Oh my goodness, that shot of operation cobalt... that means we're getting a flashback of it! This tells me CRM was behind the operation for sure.
So Ready for this ❤
eita que o pau vai torar na casa de nocaaaaaa!!!!! ansioso demais!!!! meu deuuuuus!!!
SEASON 12 PLZZZESE
It's gonna end in a cliffhanger an well not see them reunited bc the ones in charge care more about money and dgaf about us fans. We want this reunion more than anything or at least I do. I wanna see Rick back with the gang they're pussyfootin around and it's bs. I don't want to get my hopes up but they know we're gonna tune in to see what happens
CRM destroys Atlanta , Los Angeles, Campus Colony, and etc.
goats back
WE FUCKIN' MADE IT BOYS
Bout Damn Time AMC
I'm in tears, I have goosebumps. I can't wait!!!!!
Dios mío🙀
The goat finaly returned 🗣️🔥
I. CAN'T.  WAIT!!!
This better be fuckin good!
1:15 THATS FUCKING ATLANTA! Wait so the whole fall could truly be early CRM influence?TWD explained was right?
As a big fan of TWD this is too exaggerated and obviously it's coming with thickest plot armors and none sense! this show lost it's original fan base! nowadays it's Rambo more than TWD
I hope it’s good, but I don’t really know what to make of trailers.
We are so back.
,,This is the most powerful military on the planet“ honestly they have no way of knowing that but ok
Rick and Michonne are baaaaack botches 😂😂. The best duo in the history of apocalyptic shows lmfao.
....was that rick all geared up at the end?......... that was badass.
I can't describe how thankful I am for this to exist. It's truly beautiful.
LFG‼️🥹
This is gonna make dead city look like shit 💀
I think Rick's voice has changed. 😢
THE GOAT IS BACK, AND HES MORE READY THAN EVER
MINHA MÃE E MEU PAI VEY!!! NÃO SOU MAIS ÓRFÃO
La espera valdrá la pena
Military in TWD: Failed. CRM at first look: 0:55 Me: What took you soo long Mister Locke xD ? 0:57
I know they were talking abouts doing a walking dead movie abou5 Rick but I guess they decided to just stick to a series.
FINALMENTE
Warzone in i thing best coming twd series ?
Can't wait to hear from Rick again about Stuff and Things
Was that Atlanta getting napalm I swear we saw that scene in a flashback on The Walking Dead Season 2 with Shane and Lori watching it happen?
I haven’t been so excited for walking dead in so long
They bet not kill my girl michonne
Woke
Please have Daryl 😭
Looks exciting!
It’s crazy how this doesn’t look anything like the walking dead but it makes it look like something so damn special 😮
Holy shit.
He has just 1 hand
who worst parent Kuku or  Michonne she left kids figure it out to look her man lol
I can’t freaking wait
Morgan jones return
THEY’RE BAAAACK
Daryl went against runners so now Rick gonna one up him 😂
🤯👍👌speechless
Endless Apocalypse Zombie, we will see how will looks.
I just hope it’s good we have waited 6 years for 6 episodes I hope it’s well written just like Daryl Dixon and dead city
IM SO HYPED!!
i missed this so much, 2 legends are finally back
The trailer so promising..it feels like a movie...
Goosebumps 🤩 Damn no one tops Rick, I've missed seeing him kill scene's
Can’t wait to see this shit
Chills
0:35 what ?? 😂😂
Soooooo John Locke Lives
Meh, uninterested. They took too long to tell us Rick’s story. But hey, he wanted to get out of the series.
0:22 is that Philly?
Kino incoming?
Is rick losing a hand?
I like how everyone could yell that was rick at the end based on just his walk 😂😂😂
The walking dead
My wife is my choice. My daughter is my choice. My half black son is my mistake.lol😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅
Finally Rick fckin Grimes is back!
please be good
Still Standing 🔥
Very curious as too who the soldier is towards the end of the trailer
Anyone else catch how we deliberately don't see Rick's left hand? Probably bc it's missi-- 👀
this shit's so cheesy. I can't wait
This is easily going to be the best the walking dead spin off series, I can't wait!!!
I feel like IF they reunite, it won't be until the finale or some dumb shit
Hope we see RED MACHETE RICK
The only spin-off I'm actually looking forward too. Glad to see Andrew and Dinah still got it as Rick and Michonne. Can't wait to finally see how Rick Grimes story ends, in what's essentially TWD season 12, let's just be honest here. Still wish this was a movie trilogy instead though.
If they were going to have all of these spinoffs, they just should have kept the original show instead. The Negan\Maggie show was just ok. The Daryl show was pretty good. This didn't look very promising but I'll hope for the best.
Holy shit we are getting a full scene of the bombing of atlanta?
I really do believe this show will be the best one we ever gotten
Walking Dead taking place in Philly ? Let’s gooooo
New series? Why play with my heart like that.. is it still gonna be a 6 episode limited series, or not?
peak
bad ass!
HES BACK ❤️🎉!!!
كنت هنا
rotfl
Can't wait 🔥🔥
Best thing to happen this year so far.
Is he staying with the crm by choice??
يامجنون ياغرايمز🔥
It looks good  I’m just annoyed, because on other spin offs they give you the one episode on prime, and then you have to buy AMC+
PLEASE RELEASE THE SPIN OFFS IN THE UK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Genuinely looks amazing, hope they blow our expectations out of the water. I cannot put into words how excited I am to finally have Rick and Michonne back in action. These characters deserve an ending, I hope it's a happy one - after all these years of waiting we as fans deserve that.
YES SIRRR
CRM!
I wonder who’s under that mask👀
The Ones Who Fart
DUDE IM SO EXCIED THESE LITTLE SNIP IT SPOILERS BEEN DRIVING ME CRAZY
Looks fantastic!
Finally something worth watching
We need more than 1 season. There is no way in hell any TWD fan will be satisfied until Rick, Michonne, Judith, RJ, Daryl, Carol, Maggie, Hershel, Morgan, and Mo (and Negan) are all reunited.
Oh hey, that's my mom's birthday
U think he’s gonna have both his hands or he gonna lose one like in the graphic novels cause I watched this trailer twice and there isn’t a good shot of his left hand.
A quick prayer for Glen who couldn’t be apart of this journey, thanks to Daryl’s impulsive outburst 😐
New "Series". Doesn't say new "limited series". Could they ve secretly planning more than 1 season??
Quality is crazy
John Locke and Rick Grimes   Zombies vs Smoke monster
THE GOAT RETURNS!!
so, it's gone from a movie to a series?
Woooooooow
LFG 😭🔥
Hell yeah! Sheriff Rick Grimes returns!
Can't believe Rick is finally back
Is a prosthetic arm on his left hand? I can’t see properly but it looks like he only Has one hand?
hell yeah lfg and i hope they find each other in the first episode too but i'm not holding my breath
FINALLYYYYY im so excited!! Can't wait to see this next chapter play out!
1:41 who is that
I’m so excited
Cant wait for this its been to long since the last time we saw Rick...wonder whats he been through in those 6-8 years at the CRM...but in all this Michonne still doesnt question her self if our group won the war against the whisperers...she problably thinks that Alpha and Beta are still out there bothering our group and she doesnt even have the urge to go back there to find out lol i know shes busy finding rick at all costs,but still...i hope somebody told her through the walky-talky that they have won the war.
What else  but.       WOW
Damn but I was stopped watching walking dead a while back,  this looks GOOD.
TERRY O'QUINN OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG
Hell.....it's about damn time.
Yeah, rick definitely lost his hand, they're trying too darn hard to hide it 😂😂😂
i am hyped for this but if they use shit graphics like this its insulting to the story and its importance . i hope they improve it
ITS REAL
La espero con ansias 🥰
This “franchise” is a goddamn zombie lmaooooo
👍
He's back! Woohoo
I'll watcht it, yes. But it still looks generic tho. I like Rick and Michonne as much as the next person. But yeah, meh🤷‍♀️
FINALLY WHAT I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR, MY TWO FAVORITES ❤😢
Great casting choice in Terry O'Quinn 🔥🔥🔥
Parece que vai ser incrível ❤❤
Somos Rick Grimes 🍷😭
Insane how this show is still coming out and has actually gotten back to a place of interest
Que série vai ser essa pqp   A melhor sempre de tds os tempos!!!!!!!
HOLY SHIT LSFGGGGGGGG
John locke is back
JOHN LOCKE IS HERE
So how long are we gonna have to wait for this in Europe?....
I hope negan and Daryl meet Rick again
THEY FINALLY DROPPED A TRAILER
Scott Gimple shoots......misses again!!!!
What’s up with this guy’s voice?
1:20 brooooooooo😮😮😮😮
Show, magnífico, maravilhoso, emocionante,...
Gonna miss the murder jacket
Rick joined the military. So cool. I am in. Do it !
Yooooo!
Is it going to be long talking, crying, more talking, few zombie scenes, talking about feelings, more crying again?
The Goat GRIMES RETURN  🛐🛐🗿💯
Rick grimes is gonna go into Alexandria and realize how 80% of the people last seen with him are dead 😩
It seems like a distinct version of the derivatives of the main series, and we have waited a long time to see Rick and Michonne together again. I hope that this derivative will be the best among them.. All love and respect to you from Syria.. ❤
yeah baby yeah ❤❤❤❤
Estoy feliz, emocionado, ansioso y desesperado por el estreno🎉❤
Rick grimes
Looks great, shame us in the UK have been screwed over
na loquete es God
Welcome back!
The $13.7 million per episode The Walking Dead sequel epic.
Thank you amc
john locke and rick grimes is crazyyy
Can't wait...
Esto se ve completamente épico, creo que NUNCA un trailer de TWD me generó tanto hype
AHH THIS LOOKS AMAZING! ❤🔥
DIOS SE FUERON AL RECONTRA CARAJO
LETS GOO HYPED FOR THE RETURN OF RICK GRIMES AND MICHONNE THIS THE FUCKING MOMENT WE HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR
Michonne is not Rick's wife.lol😂
This look awesome🔥
somos Rick Grimes ☠️☠️☠️☠️
That masked soldier at the end gotta be Morgan or Darryl
I'm so freaking excited!!
i waited for this lmao okay
GAHHHH
The Goat is back
Did anyone notice that one of the scenes looked like they were showing “Operation Colbot” which was also talked about in fear the Walking Dead season 1 I believe but it seems that has something to do with the CRM but maybe I’m wrong
Why are they bombing Philadelphia?
Was that the storm from Warzone 1:35
It is going to be EPIC
WOW ITS JOHN LOCKE
Leave two young kids to search for Rick... Mother of the year, right there.
This trailer sucks !
Saudades de Rick 🇧🇷
Let's goo this drops on my birthday
Ahhhh! My wife and I just said we are gonna cry tears of joy when they reunite! We can’t wait for this! 😢🔥
RIIIIIIIIICKKKKKKK
MARK MY WORDS THIS IS GOING TO BE ONE OF THE GREATEST TV SHOWS EVER🔥🤯
NEED THAT
It will be amazing to see Rick again. I still wish this was in theaters
This is insane, I'm so excited
The Ones Who Live 🔥🔥🔥🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻 omg Richonne
WOW!
AWESOME
RICKY DICKEY DUDA GRIMES IS BACK🔥🔥
Not a single scene throughout all trailers and promos, where we clearly see Rick's left hand. He's going to lose his hand, I'm sure of it. damn it
Nobody gonna mention the Atlanta bombing flashback
OOOhhhhhhh!!!  So Good!
omfg this show looks so good I can't waitt
AHHHHH
Rick is back!!!!!! Yeeee
Godspeed guys we’ve made it
Why does this have to be only one season😭
Please don't let there be another new kid following Rick and Michonne around (unless it's Judith, though unlikely)
Rick! We have to go back!!!
"The most powerful military on the planet" better know how to aim better than the Commonwealth soldiers.
I do think that all rick needs is to find out he has a son to really push him and inspire him alot more to try harder to escape
RICK IS BACK
Let's goo oooooooooo
JOHN LOCKE!!!
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Jadis better be secretly helping Rick
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
What’s this going to be streamed on/??/
Looks good!  It’s just a shame something like this hadn’t been produced like a year or two ago…
Been waiting For RICK & MICHONNES  return for so long looks epic can't  wait THE BEST CHARACTERS ON THE WALKING DEAD.
DOWN WITH THE CRM! LONG LIVE GRIMES!!!!
Will it be available in the U.K.? 👀👀👀
What a journey it has been, and clearly..the best is yet to come.
GOOSEBUMPS
Meeeeeeeeeeen I can't wait to see Rick again definitely Andraw Lincoln is the best Zambia actor ❤❤❤
THIS SHOW IS GONNA CHANGE THE WALKING DEAD UNIVERSE 🙏🙏
I am still here with you.
That smile at the end says it all. Awesome
Can this franchise die now ffs.
This is gonna suck just as bad as the other spinoffs, huh? 😭😭
I haven't even finished The Walking Dead yet...  I'm in season 7
Im so happy that they changed the look of the CRM soldiers
Don’t tell me what I can’t do!
Why didn't they just put this budget towards the main show
Rick is the walking dead
LETS GOOO!!!!
Someone hand me a chair, I'm gonna pass away 👀 People, my husband and my wife are returning 😭😭😭
That atlanta flashback gave me chills
WHAT A GLORIOUS FUCKING TRAILER THIS IS
Will it come to the UK?
Looks Epic 🔥
Rick's side of the story looks more interesting.
Gimme gimme gimme gimme.........give me it already cause I'm related to witness and be apart of this MASTERPIECE!!!!!!.
I cant wait bring it Mrs Richonne
Who was that walking up in the armor they don’t do just any random person
Just imagine if we don’t get a CRM vs commonwealth war
Is this Rick Grimes?
Finally the legend returns :)
GOAT IS RETURN🐐🔥
I'm sorry what is this
GOOSEBUMPS
Please don't be the michonne show for half the episodes
John Locke?!! takes me back to the glory days of Lost. Man I miss that show. I haven't watched the walking dead since they killed of SPOILERS... You know who with a bat. But I might tune in to this just to see Terry and Andrew share the screen together. Both amazing actors, respect.
John Locke and Rick Grimes!!! Let's fucking gooooooooo!!!!
I'm so excited! Just do us one favour and bring Carl back as a hallucination or something I don't care. I just want to see Andy and Chandler on screen togather again
AGHHHHH
Salt and Vi....
Looks like Michonne might die
🔥
I love how beautifully shot these new spin-offs are
I just can't wait !!!!! Frebuary has to come very quickly 😂😂😂❤
QUÉ GANAS DE QUE EMPIECE 🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌
i'm really hoping that AMC will bring all of the spinoffs back together into the main show again after they've run their course for a FINAL hoorah. Rick and Michonne reunite with their kids, Daryl comes back to the US, Maggie and Negan coming back. i don't think it should be a full 22ep season, maybe like 6-8 episodes
Very cinematic trailer. Looking forward to it!
Did he forget about RJ? Lol! Besides that, I’m so freaking stoked!!! Ahhhh!!! Gave me goosebumps
❤❤❤ finally!!  Can tell that Rick Grimes walk a mile away even with uniform 🤣🥰❤️❤️  If John Locke tells you to push the button.. don’t do it! 🤣😎
the walking dead is in the past, stop trying.
This is all I've been waiting for.
Perfect trailer!!!!! Doesn't spoil anything more trailers need to be like this
This trailer honestly looks so good! I can't wait for Rick and Michonnes return!
This actually looks better than TLOU series, and that’s saying A LOT, because it was pretty much perfect. But god damn these characters have my heart, so pumped to see the significant budget increase, this is gonna be incredible.
john locke and rick grimes 🙌
I am waiting for the season to be released quickly, please.
Looks shite
Even though I'm so very excited for their return, I do feel like the reunion will be dragged out for the whole season with them really only getting together in the last episode and then BOOM it'll hint at a season 2 🙈
Was that Cyrus at the end
Watching after his departure in season nine. It's good that he still maintains that spirit of a bold leader. And it will seriously be an epic return for Danai and Andrew as Rick and  Danai as Michonne.
The new era of CRM armor looks amazing. I love how each time we see them it gets more and more improved.
Can't wait to see you ❣️😍❤ again ❤❤❤️❣️❤️❤️🫀❤️🫀❤️‍🔥🫀❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❣️❤️‍🔥❣️❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥😍❤️‍🔥😍❣️🔥❣️🔥🔥❤️‍🔥❣️
Stopped watching shortly after the Negan stuff.  This will get me back into the franchise..
Fuck....the hype and Goosebumps I'm having right now😩❤️‍🔥
Announce UK release of Dead City, Daryl Dixon and Fear Season 8.
Can't wait ❤❤️‍🔥❤️❤️‍🔥🔥🫀🫀
اخيراااااااا
Omgggggggg
U ruined everything AMC , I loved the walking dead before season 7 but after season 6 U r just ruining everything fuckin thing
this looks awful. you twd fans are terrible as well. you LET them do something like this and now we lost the show we loved,
straight chills
OMFG
FINALMENTE!!!!
Oh man I didn't think I'd get goosebumps from this, Rick grimes just makes me love the show again. And the good actors are STACKED from what I see
Hopping twd happy family together before end..
"-This is Twd? -This is what Twd always supossed to be"
I'm not even sure what to think of the trailer but seeing Andrew Lincoln back in the TWD world - that makes me happy.
TWD is still my all-time favourite TV series. I’ve stuck with it through the highs and lows. TOWL has to be good, I have hope
Also no more trailers plzzzzzzz
Finally that's for Judith wish to see her dad rick and mom machone
This shit bout to b too 🔥
😬😬😬😬😬
Omg x10
Hooooly shit He's back FINALLY 🙌 Cannot wait
Woooaaaahhh. . . This looks so. . . Meh
But where’s heath 😭
WHO IS HYPED FOR RED MACHETE RICK, PEAK TWD!!!
Interestingggg, that shot at 1:14 is from season 2 if I remember correctly 🤔
As a TWD fan who stopped watching some time around season 8, THIS LOOKS GOOD! I will be watching 🙌🏼
OHAAAA
Yes yes
I've never been more ready for anything in my ENTIRE LIFE.
Like for a successful 2024. ❤💙💜
All I can say is it's good to have our main character back on screen.
Urgh...just when I thought I was out...they drag me right back in.
THIS IS WHAT IVE BEEN WAITING FOR!!!!!!!!!!!! THE RETURN OF THE EPIC DUO Richonne!!!!!!
plz air it in the uk
That’s cool that they have Atlanta being bombed wonder if we’re gonna get a backstory or something 🤔
Heellll yeeeeeaaaaaahhhhh
this looks SO good!!!
That guy in armor near end has got to be Rick Grimes just by the way he walked and probably is walking up to Michonne and then takes helmet off
John locke and Rick grimes😮
Hype. 🎉
That herd at 0:18 is probably the same one from the Walking Dead series finale.
Chills all over, the whole time 🧟‍♀️🧟‍♂️🧟
John Locke? Yes!
Ricky Dicky Dooh Dah Grimes
Hope this is better than the other series.  Dixon was okay, lots of mistakes made but overall a decent show, Dead City was the same, good ideas but not terrific execution, beloved characters in a series that was of lower quality than TWD, even the last couple of seasons.  Get your mojo back guys, c'mon. Take the time, do it right.
LETS GOOOOOO🥹🥹🥹❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS ITS FINALLY HAPPENING !
THE NEW WORLD'S GONNA NEED RICK GRIMES  I BELIEVE IN RICK GRIMES  "BELIEVE A LITTLE BIT LONGER"
This is honestly amazing
Rick will hopefully revive the twd
This shit gonna be ass😂
Were the ones who wait
Te amo mucho Rick Grimes 🤧❤️
Omg, the people from Fortnite 😱😱
I love you rick❤️‍🔥
Damn... Releasing sooner then expected😅
Spoil* Michonne is dead
What is that? New season? (I'm still on season 10😢)
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Rick with the epic punch lines already missed this 😩🔥🔥🔥
Praying Rick sits around that table at the end of all this how amazing that would be WITH EVERYONE 🙏🙏
Ok en el final Michonne está sonriendo con la ropa moviéndose x el aire DE UN HELICÓPTEROOOOOOO
Who was that in the white suit at the end?
Incredible!! I need look Rick now!!
1:37 I wonder who that is...
like if you also thought the very last frame gives you that freaking chill of Rick hurting/killing Michonne by mistake....PLEASE NO ! ! ! !
But will they ever reunite with the funky bunch?😂
Friends…are we back?
LETS GOOOOOOOO
I already need a second season. These are going to be the shortest 6 episodes ever in my life.
My God... That said nothing
Military still so advanced, how are walkers still hanging around?💀
I feel sorry for the people that stopped watching this show because their favorite survivors died. It's a zombie apocalypse, show wouldn't make sense if everyone stayed alive like it was a cartoon.
Twd forever 😉💕
This is going to be incredible. Can't wait
Let’s gooooo
Last thing I'm watching of TWD.  Not watching the last spin offs.
As long as he's reuniting with his family, that's all i want to see... please don't leave this a cliffhanger
"My wife is my choice." Very purposeful first line out of Rick in the official trailer. Let's go!!
This drops on my 39th bday and i couldnt be more happy! Fuck yes!
You can really tell this was gonna be a movie
comes out on my birthday thats a W
They could have done something and drop the show on valentines day
This is going to be fantastic. I can’t wait for this show. There will be so many dead walkers!
Man they're still really hiding his left hand ahah
Ебаааааааааать это эпично
I am so excited for this but also sad
I think Michonne may meet her end in this show..
6 episodes are not enough
S 1-2 are gold 🥇
give it to me now!!!!!!
was that john locke
If the show is as great as the trailer it will be awesome 😍
Gone for two seasons and it's such a big deal lmao
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!! ❤
I think Rick got his hand cut off.
Esses zumbis ainda existem?
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 CAN’T WAIT
Just waiting the episode or spin off that Rick and Negan cross paths
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 CAN’T WAIT
Can’t put a mask on that swagger Rick
Are the Stormtroopers in this one? And the dude with the tiger?
Now he needs his kick ass jacket back
I wish the letters on my keyboard could be bigger for the excitement in my voice...... LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!
Aww man I have a bad feeling about this, the trailer isn't showing Rick's left arm and hand. There's a high chance it got cut off similar to the comics. It'll be interesting to see why he lost it but hopefully it's still attached.
This looks absolutely INSANE!!!
Not sure about ricks voice lol sounds funny compared to show but is that Shane hallucination at the end
“My wife is my choice My daughter is my choice” omg it reminds me of the beginning of the series but instead of Lori and Carl it’s Michonne and Judith 😭❤️
Actually I’m trying to locate The Walking Dead movie Starring Eddie Griffin Joe Morton Allen Payne And other legends.
Cant wait 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
is this the walking dead ?
full goosebumps🔥
i love it
Can’t wait for Daryl and Judith to reunite with Rick it’s been so long they better reunite
So why did the show even end if you’re just gonna make spin-offs
I’m wondering why the CRM don’t want him to leave? Does he know to much about him and if he leaves they believe he might be a huge security risk?
this looks like a cinematic masterpiece
It’s fair enough to say he lost his arm lol they’ve hid it through out the trailer
0:48 bro this a movie 😭😭😭
I'm from Mexico, I've been watching this story since the beginning and I have a question for AMC, how the fuck should I see this spectacular show if AMC+ Is not available on my country?
"Look at my eyes sir, You tell me" 🔥
Fucking masterpiece I'm so impatient for this
He's back ♥
Holy shit ….
My birthday is 25 February 😃
Honestly in my opinion instead of doing 3 spin offs with daryl , negan /maggie and rick / michonne  they should of just done a season 12 of twd with 25 episodes as a big epic final season
RICK GRIMES
HOLYYYYYY SHIIIIII I NEEEDD THIS SHOW ASAP😱🔥🔥
Please send it in Sweden ❤
so we got Rick Grimes vs John Locke?
Well it’s Time for the goat of walking dead to return all the build up hope it was all worth it now we wait this will be great hopefully
RIIIIIIIICK! Look everybody it's Rick!
This doesn’t seem like the walking dead anymore
who's that at 01:40?
Pretty sure he is missing his left hand at 1:02 and has an attachment like Merle did.
This really looks good! Awesome
the walking dead is an appropriate name because they wont let this crap die lol
hope we can see a reunion between rick and judith and personally i want rick and daryl or mostly rick and negan but not possible because they are in different spinoffs
Damn this show still going ???
World beyond finally tells the truth that the Military is CRM where jadis took rick and that's the reason why he was not there in world beyond.according to Jadis, she already did mention..  Now it turned into Walking dead Warfare..
Did she just say Darryl while watching an explosion or am I tripping
this was the reason i watched walking dead and you guys took that away from me for a few seasons... about fn time Rick is back!
boy who lived
FUCK YES!!!
Okayyyyyy, don’t careeeee, Where’s Rick?
Rick Grimes return is the only thing im looking forward to this year tbh
He is still in the hospital bed. and all this is just a nightmare.
this is not only only spinoff but it feels like real walking dead vibes because our hero officer friendly rick grimes is back just like season 5 .
Twd we uppppp ⬆️🤩🙌🙌🙌‼️‼️🗣🗣💯💯💯🔥🔥🔥🔥
ayoo wtf series?!?!?!
I feel like they should have kept the main series going and just weaved all these spinoffs together
This trailer look sick🔥🔥🔥, I feel like michonne gets captured by the crm because she smiled at the helicopter similar to how Rick did at the end of the main show
i actually can’t believe i’m witnessing Andrew Lincoln return as Rick Grimes, insanely excited for this show!!
no shiiiiiiiii
The GOAT returns. The Mac is Back. The champ is here. Return of the Mac. Let's get it!!!
"Thank you Grimes. You showed me I can't get away"   Okay Rick definitely got punished for escaping and i think his hand got the chop chop 😭
Who. Saw the dwarf guy on YouTube shorts  👇
They’re going to get out of that shithole, and they’re going to get back home, and they’re going to do all of that. . . *together!*
Rick. Fucking. Grimes.
Andrew Lincoln is such An amazing actor I’ve missed seeing Rick on screen
Wow that looks awesome and that’s cool that they John Locke from lost to come on the show.
They killed Michonne's character when she left her 2 children to go find Rick. As someone who already lost a child once, no way in hell she would have done it. RIP to yet another great female character flushed down the drain to support a male character.
I'm not gonna lie...I got a bit misty eyed ! All this waiting. Finally a trailer. I'm so excited my two favorite characters are back. Yes, it's just a television show but it's like seeing a long lost friend again. So excited ! TWD do us right..We've waited a loooonnnnggg time❤
visual effects look very bad
Bruh Michonne looks so goofy at the end 😭
The milking of the series continues...
"The style design in Walking Dead couldn't be any worse" Jadis: "hold my haircut"
I already want a season 2. Imma wait till the last episode and binge this shit.
Guys  They’re not showing his left hand at all . We’re getting the hook hand!
THIS IS A MASTERPIECE🧡
I can’t wait for this! Absolutely can’t wait. I’d love to see the walking dead top the charts again
Nice,  it looks good, but it doesn't look like we get much of his time away.  They aren't taking out the CRM...  I think Rick died and they captured Michonne... She has been gone at least 2 years at TWD end...
A fucking apache damn the commonwealth don't stand a chance
esto se va a poner GOOD
man have I missed rick. can't wait to see him again
Loved this first trailer ❤
Been a fan of this universe for over 10 years now. Absolutely cannot wait to see Rick and Michonne back in action!
Man, this looks significantly higher budget than the other series.
Is that John locke
GARBAGE LADY IS BACK!!!!!!!!!❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉
Good, Good...
Man am I hoping Rick and Negan meet again
🏅🏅🏅🏅🏅
👍👍👍❤️❤️❤️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
“Look into my eyes sir… you tell me” DAT SHIT COLD
How much are you going to milk this dead show ?  Season 1-5 were incredible but the rest is terrible
Hyped for this!! Looks solid af
I grew up watching Ricks character from a little kid to a 23 year old adult and I can’t wait to see how his journey ends and michonnes.
,,This is the most powerful military on the planet "-it gives  me chills. walkers:,,we are too many" crm:,,alwayes outnumbered  never  outgunned
Best part of 2024
The walking dead was so over along time ago...now its just so boring not interesting anymore
If you ask me, The Walking Dead just feels like Fast & Furious now. All surreal and just wrong.  Now I know some of y'all will say: "Oh, but how come a zombie series will be realistic?" ...C'mon, now. It just feels odd now. That thing this show had back in season 1 to 4 is gone. That feeling, is just no longer there. Same happened with Fast & Furious, first 3 movies felt great, but then all turned, like... just bad. It was a good story, yes. I love it, but oh man it was so poorly directed. They should have kept season's 1 showrunner! ... But anyways, let's just hope this Rick's comeback is as good as they make it seem.
But will machone even find Rick
wow this looks amazing
the immortals are back...🔥 February 2024
he has no hand?????????
If I'd have to guess who the hidden soldier is, I'd say its either Morgan or Al from fear the walking dead
متى ستنزل المسلل لأنني متحمس جدا
Feels like we’ve been waiting an Eternity to find out what happens to these two characters. Too fucking excited for this
♥
PORRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA, SE EU MORRER ANTES DE VER ESSA SÉRIE VOU FICAR PUTO
They could still bring this to the big screen. The Chosen did it so why can't The Walking Dead?
This is what the common wealth should have been.
I haven't watched the show or spinoffs for years for obvious reasons, but this actually looks awesome, will definitely check it out.
This looks awesome.
WE ARE SOOOO BACK
EU TE AMOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO RICK GRIMES
And will it, along with the other spinoffs, be available in the UK? Shameful to keep fans waiting like this. Or are you just happy for them to pirate it?
CARALHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Rick, the fucking goat, Grimes is back ladies and gentlemen! I cannot wait any longer!
I feel like that CRM soldier at the end might be someone we know.
Where’s it going to be on in the UK please?
I noticed Michonne smiled up towards a helicopter at the end of the trailer, like rick did at the end of TWD.
To hear him say “my wife is my choice, my daughter is my choice, my life is my choice”🥺 I can’t wait until Rick finds out he has a son😭🥹
This looks absolutely insane
chamaaaaaaa
Rick Grimes <3
It is gonna suck lol
Although a love to see the ogs return a have zero faith in the writers that they can actually pull a proper wrap up to a story that has drugged unnecessarily for so long
shit got me kicking anf screaming RICKKKK 🔥🔥
See Rick Grimes gave me goosebumps and this trailer was fuckin amazing! So hyped can’t wait for this to release.
This is INSANE
Get this trending
ohhhh i’m so hyped
Hollllly frick this is actual HYPE, I cannot wait!!
Fuck yeah
They could not have picked a better actor to play Major General Beal. If the show is as good as its actors & this trailer, it's gonna be something. I really hope it doesn't disappoint! Very excited.
Bruhhhhh!!!! 🫡
I am so hyped for this. This looks fucking epic - parden my french im so excited for this show!!!
Amo essa série, há 14 anos q asisto.
oh rick grimes😍😍😍February better makeace
More garbage from the TWD
That soldier at the end…are they a walker under the mask?
JOHN LOCKE confirmed
Very woke indeed
I've had this weird feeling, over the past three weeks, involving Rick and Michonne that I'm hoping, if done, is done right.  Lets just say a 3rd party might enter.
DAJE RICK!!!!
Bros hand is definitely gone
Excited to see this duo back !!
YIBAMBE  !!!!!!!
Bro plz don’t tell me we go have episodes with Rick not in it bruh I seen enough of M and I don’t care about all the new characters I wanna see Rick in every episode
I really want to get excited, I really do but I know that the show isn’t going to air internationally.  It really hurts…why does AMC have to be such a bad company to lock their content behind AMC+ which isn’t available internationally?
Rick Scenes needs to be like 70% of the screen time in this series. We didn't wait 6 years for he to be overshadowed by 800 side characters
this is hype.
*0:40** Wtf is that thing?!*
I am seriously so stoked for this!! 😎🥰
No matter how far this family goes, even to whole other continents, they will find their way to eachother
Where do these more people more characters Now An Army Came From  Ain't it supposed to be a Zombie apocalypse......
That left arm is definitely gone
You can tell the movie aspect are there
This is SICK!!!  Bring it on.
John Locke is back too!😂 🎉
Do something for streaming this in India too ya.
John Locke! What an amazing choice 🤙🏻 LFG
Morgan and Judith should make a appearance in the season finale of this show
Rick MF Grimes, lets go!
Vai lançar pra Netflix ou pra prime videos ?
It would be the biggest troll The walking dead has ever pulled if they killed off one of them before they got to reunite
Probably gonna be shit like the  recent seasons.
Looks great 👍
Beyond excited for this
What if that’s the commonwealth there destroying before the season 1 clip ?
So happy Rick alive
1:01 look very closely on ricks hand. Confirmed. Ricks Hand Will be cut off.
I'm shaking with excitement, there is blood, there is action, there is passion ⚔️🔥📈 Only Rick grimes could get you this excited to have the walking dead come back!
Richonda Forever.
WOW!  This must be incredible!!!
This is fucking beautiful
Cant wait for this. Look at the commonwealth soldiers they look so bad ass. The uniform has changed so much from the fear of walking dead. So much better then the twd World beyond
We’re so close! I noticed they never revealed his left hand, how he holds the stick at 0:29 and a few shots after. Either his hand is actually cut off or its a misdirection. I’m so hyped!
This better not be mostly Michonne and some Rick! It better be Ricks story that’s what made me love the walking dead. And you guys lost me the last few seasons without him!
Finally, was waiting for Rick to come back before I ever touched TWD again.
Caralho, agora hypou ainda mais!!!! 😮 Sem palavras apenas ..
" My wife is my choice " "My daughter  is my choice " "My life  is my choice "....  For those  who commented  that Michonne  was not Rick's  wife 🍷
Lance would fit in perfectly here. Lance could be the one the writers could use to connect CRM with the Commonwealth. Wasted potential.
Yesss The goat 🐐 it’s Back 🔥🔥🔥🤯🤯🤯🫡🫡🫡 look in my eyes Sir You tell me, good answer Love it
I need this NOW
I suffered through a lot of bad The Walking Dead and a lot of bad The Walking Dead spinoffs to see this,
they’re hiding rick’s left hand so well it’s obvious he lost it
None of these new series can touch the original
It’s been so long since I seen Rick on screen. I’ve been waiting on this series to come back for YEARS!!!! Daryl Dixon was a great series but hopefully all them tie into this !
Season 5 prime rick is coming back😎
I am really excited for this. I've missed Rick Grimes!
MY BABIES ARE BACK AND IT ALL LOOKS SO BEAUTIFUL.   "My wife is my choice. My daughter is my choice." Just waittttt til he meets RJ😭😭😭💕
We are about to witness the best season of the whole TWDU
Please don't be a michonne show. I want 90 percent rick.
Terry O'Quinn is great actor and his role in Lost was great. I hope this role will be good too.
Haven’t felt this excited in such a long time! Rick Grimes is back! We’re the ones who live!
3rd prime incoming
Just Hit like for the GOATs 🐐 Return RICK GRIMES…
My goat is back
Officer friendly long gone
Ooooh this show has a crazy kool vibe
This should've been the final season
“My wife is my choice, my daughter is my choice” damn RJ really don’t exist lol.
So the CRM bombed atlanta? they revealed the same scene from s1 on 1:13
Bro this shit is going to blow the other spin-offs out the water
REAL CINEMA IS BACK!
Can’t wait 🥲
The greatest leader is coming backk ❤️‍🔥
1:42 obviosly thats shane
oh my god i'm so excited
Ricky dicky doo dah Grimes is back baby!!!
Omg
IM SO EXICTED
They are back Andrew Lincoln & Danai Gurira we finally get acting acting such an amazing cast Richonne is back RickGRimes and MichonneGrimes are back and yes it’s MrsGrimes it’s canon
My god. I am hyped.
We are getting ODST now let’s go!
I could be wrong but the shot of the helicopters going over the field at night, the fire ahead of them looks very similar to the commonwealth estates from the series finale. At 1:12 to be exact
Brutal 🔥
AAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH
💯💯
RICK GRIMES>>>GENERAL BEALE
Officially lost hand 1:00
Looks great can’t wait
Great Trailer! Hoping it all lives up to the well deserved hype!
The Goat 🐐 Has Came Back!!!!!!
🗣I'M HERE FOR AAALLL OF IT!!🤣🤣 Blessings From Texas🤠
No mames no pude aguantarme y llore 😢😢
John Locke and Rick Grimes. LETS GOOO
ohmy god
This is the big one. All roads lead to Rick Grimes. Let's do this.
Looks like we getting a flash back to when Atlanta was firebombed.
Well I guess I’ll keep my AMC+ subscription a little longer……this looks good.
We are ones who live
Ricky do dah grimes is BACK
Let me see de baby
February 25th can't get here fast enough
Lets goooo
Its time the legend returns. We waited too long. Rick the dna of the walking dead
My GOAT is back❤❤🥹
I'm so glad we get to see Rick come back. He was the heart and soul of the show. This looks awesome
I need this now.....not much to look forward to but damn if this is not the best thing in the universe can't freaking wait......
Finally !!
00:49 Montana? 🤔
I got even more excited when I realized Thorne is played by the same actress who played Mazikeen in Lucifer.
sonunda yeni bireyler gösteriyosunuz aferim
😇🤗😎
Wait stop 1:14 that the same scene from season 1 when they blow atl so that helicopter in season 1 was the crm the whole time. Interesting
Looks like it's going to be worth the wait!  I read an article on Forbes that stated the entire budget for this 6 episode series was $83,678,263 So basically AMC put all their eggs in the basket for this one. Read in the same article that Robert Kirkman has been in talks with AMC about rebooting The Walking Dead and making it true to the comics. Page by page. Only thing is, he wants it to be an animated series like The Invincibles. Anyhow, seriously looking forward to Rick's return and hoping he finally makes it home to his family.
This will be the best show EVER. I bet my a LIFE on it.
Enough is enough. Better release it soon 😅
1:01 Rick is definitely missing his left hand
All I know is that this season better run all the way through with no mid season breaks! And we better get a Rick & Michonne reunion within 2 episodes lol
My glorious king Rick grimes is back
Holy crap, cannot wait 😢
Finally
Can't wait to see Rick and Michonne again...whoo hoo!
อยากดูไม่ไหวแล้วโว้ยยยย😂❤
💥
Why is the soundtrack almost identical to the one from Netflix's The Witcher???😂🎉
2 Water Street Camden Nj for the shot of rick on the bench.
i am not exited for rick michone reunion. i am actually exited for daryl and rick reunion...
Literally screamed when I saw Terry O'Quinn. He is an amazing actor and I can't wait to see his character. I feel like him and Andrew Lincoln will be an amazing duo.
omfg John Locke(Terry O'Quinn) is here!!!!
Can't Wait foR This Masterpiece ❤️❤️❤️
The return of the g.o.a.t Rick G. Cant wait! Going to be epic
THE GOATS ARE BACKKK ❤
Pretty sure that bombing scene is from S1 when Shane and Lori looks at Atlanta being firebombed. CRM having an Apache is neat.
Dam I can't wait!!!!
This looks AMAZING !
Goose bumps😳😳
Let's go I can't wait 🤩🤯😱🤩💯🔥
My intuition is telling me that the last soldier we saw all covered up is Silas. Any thoughts?
1:35 Looks like the same gas the CRM were planning to use on the other communities from the second season of World Beyond.
Was that Ruben Blades?
Cine 🚬🚬🚬
Awsome
rick and daryl i cant wait
1:13 this scene is literally taken from the first season I believe in the original show where Shane and Lori see Atlanta is getting nuked. Tell me it's not.
WAIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIITTTTTT 1:01 ... NO LEFT ARM :O
Since when did the walking dead become so fucking ridiculous. What happened to the grounded, visceral portrayal of the apocalypse that gave this series its foothold and explosive growth? Why is it now storm troopers, missile launching helicopters and a mob of a MILLION fucking walkers!?
gagging
Im so excited
Is it February yet?!?!?  I'm so ready!
Coming to the UK 2087
OMGGGGGGGGG
When you thought it couldn't get any better. 2024 is the year it all changes. Be safe my brothers & sisters.
Lisa?!
What a great trailer my friends, and to think that this was supposed to be Rick films for the theater.
i hope Actor Corey Hawkins will finally play Heath Character Again in The Walking Dead The Ones who lives season 2 & Season 3 & Season 4 & Season 5 & Season 6 & Season 7 & Season 8 & Season 9🙏🏾🥺✝️
The look in Rick and Michonne's eyes in their respective scenes is enough to hype me to the extent of reminiscing of how far we along with them have come.
How is there still any interest in this show/spinoffs?
I can't wait to see them both reunite!!!❤
RICKKKKK
john locke!
Minuto 1:39 is Rick Grime
I'll be watching!   🧟‍♀
Never been more excited for Walking Dead!
😴😴😴😴😴
It's depressing that this show is still getting rinsed. Like at what point does Hollywood just feel stupid continuing with the same garbage over and over again and again. Like stop dafuq?
RICK GRIMES
I can't wait for this show to come out it will be insane
I’m excited 🔥🔥🔥
its the guy from fortnite
RICK GRIMES
OMG Chills from John Locke
Ugh so HAPPY I CAN'T WAIT
Officer friendly disappeared back when he ripped the guys jugular vein out with his teeth. To save Carl Darrell and Michonne.
OH EM GEEEEE! This looks absolutely amazing. RICK AND MICHONNE…  I’m so fringin’ excited for this!!! ❤️
we're back
You are going to see everything that happened in the cobalt operation and where were the soldiers who were left at the beginning of the Apocalypse
This is the Walking Dead fans been waiting for.
Ahhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!! Noow i wants now!!!!
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOO
Wait. Is Terry O'Quinn Major General Beale? Holy crap!
I haven't been this excited for TWD since season 6.
Ricky dicky do dah grimes: “my life my rules” 😤
HELL YEAH
John Locke flashes sideways into the zombie apocalypse to meet Rick motherfucking Grimes!  Lost stopped airing 5 months before The Walking Deads first season.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Can’t wait to see Rick Grimes back!! 🎉
It's a shame we know that he doesn't survive at the end. Poopy.
I noticed that at 1:14 the reused the same shot of Atlanta being bombed in TWD season 1 so maybe they’re gonna explain some CRM ties to that. And the final shot of the trailer with Michonne looking up is a straight parallel to Rick’s final shot in TWD series finale of him also smiling at being taken into the helicopter again which is making me think that is Michonne being taken to or going to the CRM finally
Rick the goatttttt
Nice trailer!  Is it just me or does the helmeted soldier at the end have Ricks signiture walk?  CRM Soldier Rick Grimes confirmed??? 😮😮😮
May FEBRUARY arrive soon
After 5 years yes. To know anything about Rick Grimes, we will finally see him again in this series, which will be the end of his story.  But seriously, how much we missed him as soon as the actor left the original TWD series 🙁😢, and also Michonne when she left to look for him in the middle of season 10. I'm sad to think that this series will be the closure of his story .
I'll follow Rick Grimes to the ends of the world.
WE ARE RICK GRIMESSSSSS
John Lock , Rick Grimes, welcome back
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
❤❤❤❤ I LOVE IT
This trailer was beyond beautiful. Loved every second of it❤️. I think Rick will become a CRM soldier. At the end of the trailer I think that's him
I definitely fell off TWD when they got rid of Rick but this just might bring me back in
This comes out on my B day ;-; 25th of Feb <3 I love The walking dead so much, been watching since Day 1 is came out
How many of these are they going to churn out 🤢
anyone else notice his voice sounds weird
yup Rick 100% lost his hand
💤 💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤
Been waiting years for this. After watching this it seemed worth it.
Wish this would just be like the zombies and stay dead.
look in my eyes , what do you see
This is P E R F E C T I O N  ! WE ARE THE ONES WHO LIVE !
I love the music in the background
The only Walking Dead Spinoff I’m actually hyped for.
i cant wait❤❤
They got the visuals, really hoping for the story to be good
THE BEST TRAILER OVER THE WORLD OMFG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This isnt gonna be that great an what sucks is there will be no more afterwards.
Best Birthday gift ever!! Officer Friendly is Back!!!
Bro shows how they were the same people from the CRM who attacked the city with explosives, the same one we see in the first chapters of season 1 where Shane and Lori see it💀
OMGGG CAN'T WAIT RICHONNE🔥❤💫
Believe a little bit longer
What's that city on 0:22 ???
Ohhh dude im soe xcited yesssssssss
Excited!!! 😄
CRM might be one of the most interesting enemies of this show. Wonder how rick and michonne will take them down
Amazing
finally❤😢😢
Efectivamente es cine
I CANT FREAKIN' WAIT!!!!
look me in my eyes sir HYPE
I cannot describe how good it is to see Andrew Lincoln again. He's been so missed for the last 6 years. So glad they scrapped the movies and went with the show instead.  Don't mess this one up, Gimple!
А че так мало просмотров?
I can’t stop rewatching this
I can’t wait to see the scene when Rick and Michonne finally see one another again. Feb 25th couldn’t come soon enough!
It's pretty much confirmed that after they caught him in the finale, they'll cut his left hand as a punishment.
Rick and Michonne ❤❤❤
Wow
Rick Grimes meet John Locke. I came
Rick!!!!
Todavia no vi la de Daryl
Capeta, não mostram a outra mão kkkkk
Greatest character of all time returns 🐐
I AM SO EXCITED FOR THIS
I live in Europe still no daryl dixon nor dead city series on any streaming service...... Anyway Rick must reunite with Judith, Daryl and the gang before his story is over otherwise it's all been for nothing!
DID ANYONE SEE THE ATLANTA GETTING NAPALM!?!? IT LITERALLY THE CITY AND WE GET TO SEE PHILADELPHIA! THE CRM BEEN HERE SINCE THE BEGINNING!!!
1:20 IS THAT MORGAN?
Just to see Andrew Lincoln & Danai Gurira together again has me so hyped!! Been waiting for TOWL since Rick & Michonne left! It looks pretty damn good too! Please, please let us see a reunion with Rick, Michonne & the rest of our guys .. please!! That would be amazing. Its not much to ask for either, just some stuff .. and thangs 💙♥️
This is the best thing I could get as it releases on my birthday of all days
My glorious king is back
Walking dead script writting litterly makes no sense since the show ended all the spinoffs are just that spinoffs no real story lines amd how they connecting this to what happen to Rick and how this connects commonwealth I feel it will be just lazy writing and it’s a shame
ı believe it
OMG
THE WORLD IS ABOUT TO CHANGE THIS LOOKS AMAZING. THE LAST OF US HAS NOTHING ON WALKING DEAD, LETS GOOOOOO
WHERES RICK?!
SO EXCITED
Only six episodes?
We are so back
This looks insane
Damn John locke is in the house🔥
1:13 is the same reused show from the Atlanta bombing in season 2 of the main show. This series looks like another boring sluggish soap opera. I’ll give it a chance but meh.
the camera really focused on that soldier at the end now who could it be?
This is gonna be Epic
FINALLYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
This is so incredible, it looks so good!!! Rick is back. I really hope we get to see him for more than just 6 episodes tho! I’m not ready for it to end! 🥹🥹
Did I see a crossbow arrow save Rick then…
YEEEEEEEEEEEES
This is the most hyped I have ever been! The Walking Dead keeps on getting better and better!
Sensacional!!!!!
Was that a chick with a beard lol?
I can't wait until Michonne ♛ and Rick ♔ reunite Their love knows no bounds💌
This looks like a movie. It’s beautiful. I love it.
Thank you AMC! We want it soon
OH MY F GOD
İnanılmaz bir öyle, bunu bekliyordum inan. Kavuşacakları günü.
This is giving avengers infinity war vibes 😂this is going to be amazing they always been watching
it is finally coming
The choppers bombing at 1:13 is the Atlanta bombing from Season 1
I have never been more excited for something in my life
Whats going on in ftwd
My wife is my choice!  My Daughter is my choice! My life is my choice! Wait until he finds out about his son!!!!
This shit like a whole movie can’t wait to see Rick again
About time holy shit, better late than never
Hotlanta! Literally!
The Goat is back baby
This is amazing my favorite is when probably when the chopper is being blown up
They’ve beaten the horse, let it come back as a walker, and continued to beat it. Just stop
That walk. That has to be Rick in that mask
Finalmente.... estou ansioso demais!!!
See this is what i hate about TWD lore surrounding the US Military. It is clearly evident here that the CRM is the remnants of the US Military but rather than maintaining there image as the US Military they decide no they want to be the Knights of Ren from Star Wars Shituals and force people to work for them
Look at the quality of each episode! You would think we’re getting almost three movies worth of walking dead! I’m amazed that we will finally see the closest view of the CRM and what Rick has been dealing with away from his family! Long live Rick Grimes!!
LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!
The wait is almost over, best quality and Zombie apocalypse storyline too ever grace the small screen!  There will never be another show to match the ground breaking "Walking Dead" decades long run, hate to see it end...
Did Rick not know about RJ because why is he never mentioning his son😂
This looks really cool. Hopefully it's well-written and sticks the landing because they've been teasing this stuff for so ridiculously long that living up to the hype is going to be really difficult.
that man playing Lost forgot that name
Shane season 2: "he ain't built for this world".   Rick 2024: "You tell me..."
Deseando verlo!!! ❤
Even tho this isn’t the main show. It’s gonna be just as good bc Rick is in it
I hope Michonne finds Rick and if there is a second season of this series, Judith will be there too.🥹
Perfect for Valentine’s Day
OHA OGA OHA OAHA OGAOAHAHAAOOA
I’m at school rigut now watching this
Words can't even express how excited I am for this. Been waiting for Rick and Michonne's epic return. 6 episodes of kick ass, classic Walking Dead await :)
This look absolutely stunning. Wow. Blown away.
Finally something more than a few second clip or keys or boots!!!
This is about to be EPICCCC!! Just hearing Rick's voice got me screaming rn! TWD has always had me in a choke hold! This one show i don't want to end!
Que trailer  incrível  e emocionante  ❤🔥👏👏👏 Rick & Michonne   é a  essência  do TWDU  Que venha The ones Who Live  🇧🇷 💕 🍷
MUITO PICA PQPQPQPQPQPQOPQP RICK GRIMES TE AMO LINDO
Can’t wait
Dawg who’s that mysterious character at the end?? Is that CARL???? 🙏🏾
Ohhhh I have even waiting for this since i was in high school! loooong overdue!! ❤
Haaaaaa this is gonna be the fire!
THATS MY BIRTHDAY
Can’t wait for this.
The hero the legend the g.o.a.t himselffff 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
The Walking Dead is so back.
Hell yeah
1:42 Who's that
I can't wait
ive been waiting for this for years and it looks incredible cant wait to see him back in action the the story on where they been and what they saw
It's been a while...
The King is back 💥🔥  One and Only  Rick grimes 💥🔥 seeing andrew back as rick  grimes 😍 I hope we get a rick and daryl reunion❤
Finally AMC, this is what TWD deserved, real investment, thank you very much!!! 🇧🇷♥️
The Goat, the myth, the legend Rick Grimes came back🔥🔥
He must be pissed that he was kidnapped and just told to accept it.
VAMOOOOOOOOOS RICK GRIMES REGRESA <3
THIS WAS A REALLY GOOD TRAILER MAN
Con este trailer estoy convencido de que no decepcionará para nada , luce tan genial
RICK GRIMES IS BACK!!!!!!!!
Rick Grimes is Main Character, He will find the cure to end all this zombie world once and for all ❤😊
Guys please don't screw this up like you did with the main series and Fear TWD.... you have a big shot here with Rick coming back so don't screw it
Odd, at 1:14 it seems they use footage from 2x01 of the flashback sequence when Atlanta was bombed for Operation Cobalt.
Rick grimes is back !!!!!!!!!
The Sheriff is back in town, baby!!!  Edit: hearing his voice again gave me chills
Must have been killing Rick to not know what happened to the survivors.
Thank you for caring about the fans
Let’s fucking go
1:13 Asi que fue la misma CRM quienes bombardearon Atlanta al principio de la primera temporada
No thanks. Dead horse. Beating. Etc
NÃO IGNOREM O BRASIL, FAÇAM TRANSMISSÃO E DIVULGAÇÃO NO BRASIL
My most anticipated show of 2024 is finally coming! THE LEGEND RETURNS! AMC, YOU HAVE MADE MY DAY!
Where's Rick? DONNNNNN'T CARE! WHERE'S RICK!?
Have have arrived
Do y’all think this is a mini series or end up being multiple seasons like the Maggie one
Interesting
Let’s go 🎉🎉🎉🎉
Holy shit it's John Locke
LETS GOOOOO W TWD
OMG I CANT FUCKING WAITTT!!
🥰🥰🥰
Brooo im so excited
Find Rick and take him home to his sun and daughter he needs to see them ❤
Is it just me or does the quality looks a million times better then it ever has
The romance between Rick and Michonne was never believable or had any passion, but their friendship was always strong, wish Scott Gimple would've kept them best friends instead of forcing a relationship, would've made it even more powerful for her to go look for him just like if Daryl went looking
EU ESPEREI TANTO TEMPO POR ISSO RICK GRIMES E MICHONNE ESTÃO DE VOLTA
😩🥹 I’m just so ready fa thisss
J'ai envie de pleurer c'est vraiment en train de se passer ça y est on y est ❤
I WILL BE THERE
Сюдаааа
🎵Happy days are here again The skies above are clear again So let's sing a song of cheer again Happy days are here again🎵
Imagine dropping this on a random Wednesdays in January.  This is no longer a random Wednesday, this is THE Wednesday and shall be treated as a holiday in my house
I’m in tears I’m so fucking excited!!!
"Rick! you owe me 8 years of child support!" Michonne  🗿
michone is big error of the walking dead !
IM SO EXCITEDDDDDDD
GOOSEBUMPS!
i have now seen it 10 times in a row, awesome trailer.
what if the soldier with covered face is Silas?😨 also i want terry o'quinn not to be a villain so bad😩
Wow
Let's goooooo
It’s about time
movie idole is going to be edging to this
Mais ouais trop bien j'étais même pas au courant !! Excellent ! Moi j'aime bien l'idée, mais quel incohérences 😂 le Kentucky mdrrrr ils ont craqué, c'est un jeu amc en plus, ils abusent 😂
I doubt that everything will end in one season, this series should have at least two seasons if or if it should have
Rick is this franchise. TWD is nothing without him.
FINALLY
Can’t believe they’re making a show about the guy from fortnite
Finally the king and the queen ❤
SO EPIC!!!
FUCK YEAH!
It makes you think, how with all the missiles, choppers, gunships, tanks, and men the world fell to the walking dead.
Lets goooooo this trailer loks 🔥🔥🔥
WOW THE BUDGET!  they spend 13 million on each episode, that is more than they spend on episodes on the main show and on the other spin offs, the GOAT's return is truly the main event! The main character of the whole twd universe
As long as they don’t kill Rick off, the series will continue long after.
Jesus Christ that's John Locke😱😱
This looks like a movie trailer! I’m excited. I’m glad they didn’t drop the ball because I’ve been disappointed with the walking dead for a while. But this looks like redemption.
This! Finally!
just waitin for daryls recation
John Locke
This doesn't feel like it's in the TWD universe honestly
I have a feeling this is going to be right up there with Daryl Dixon. Standing by....
Any idea who this is at 1:41?
Lookin awesome! Lets learn from the past and the community n make this the best TWD series yet!
erор нет да и вообще как дела у ❤😂😂🎉😅😊 0:35  2024
Am I the only one who knows that is Rick grimes but it just doesn’t feel like it?
They show a flashback of Atlanta getting bomb ? Weird maybe crm  had something to do with it
This looks so good
WE ARE SO BACK
I have been waiting for this day since 2019 let’s go baby
OH BABY
Rick sounds so different
AHHHH * Gritos de perra loca * Por fin el trailer, dios ya no aguanto más la espera, que ya sea Febrero que ya necesito ver el regreso del dios Rick Grimes  The King And The Queen Is Coming👑❤
The Man, The Myth ,The Legend Returns.
I MISS RICK SO MUCH
WE ARE SO BACK
Somebody cooked here
pls give me a chance to see a carol rick michonne daryl maggie negan and the kids reunion...
😍😍😍😍😍
HEEE''SSSSSS BAACCCKKKKKKKKK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
LET'S GOOOOOOOOO !!!
wow
WE WANT SEASON 5 NO MERCY JACKET (AND BEARD) RICK !! This will be one of the greatest come back in Television history.
I just got the chills
I can't wait to see Rick and Michonne reunite and I really do hope that one of them kills Jadis❤
its seem 25000 years to reach 25th feb.
john locke🤩
AMC: How many times have you watched this trailer? Me: Yes
This is the only spin-off I care about! I truly hope it delivers because we’ve waited so long for Rick’s return. So far, these trailers have presented some damn good scenes. Can’t wait
Heath?
Might as well call this season 12 because Rick is The Walking Dead!
SHOW US BOTH HIS HANDS
Thank you
OMG!!!!! This is 🔥🔥🔥!!!
HOLY FUCK IM PLAYING IT SAFE UNTIL I FINISH THIS SERIES
THE PRODUCTION LOOKS SO GOOD EVERYTHING LOOKS AMAZING I CANT WAITTTT
MEU DEUS AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
If they dont keep the soundtrack....Im out. Well. Till a few episodes so I can binge on Saturday and or Sunday. 🤣
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOO
This is gonna be sooo good, can’t wait to see Rick return, so happy to see him back🙏🐐
wow!   just wow!
FINALMENTE
All he is anymore, is a man looking for his wife and child. Anyone who gets in the way of that is gonna _lose._
Bro change your profile picture, I got confused with the notification 😂 "The ones who live" with Daryl Dixon picture
Anyone else notice the rescued shot from Season 2 where Atlanta gets bombed?
This looks freaking insane, words can't explain how excited I am for this..
It’s beautiful 😍
marvel ahh trailer
"If shit could shit it still wouldn't look as shitty as this"
This actually looks extremely high quality
Thank you for the Trailer!!!!! I thought it was awesome! TWDExplained
LETS GOOOO!! i am so ready for this
1:41 tf ?
Saved the best for last!! This looks hella good!
The Walking Dead has a special place in my heart 🤧
So did Rick forget about the little black kid he had with Michonne lmao. Didn’t hear a mention of “my son” anywhere 😂
This is gonna be the version of Rick for sure.
This is the GTA 6 of television
I'm so excited for Rick and Michonne's return.
Rick Grimes❤
does anyone think they might adapt twdg season 1, i really wanna see lee everett in live action and kenny
looks cool
IS THAT JOHN FUCKING LOCKE!????
Oh boy, do I have a feeling we're getting close. It's gonna be pee-pee pants city here real soon
AI MEU CORAÇÃOOOOOOO
IT'S HAPPENING !!! OFFICER FRIENDLY IS BACK !!!
Rick spent 3 years with his original group and 6-9 years with the CRM. The CRM is his family now.
No Heath!? Well, I guess Rick, Michonne, and Jadis will do... 😂This honestly looks great, though. All the spin offs have exceeded my expectations and this one should be the best of them.
COOL
Rick Motherfucking Grimes is fucking back!
I love twd its my favorite tv show of all time which is why it sucks so much that i cant see these spinoff shows in my country
I know we most likely won’t see the Rick and Daryl Reunion in this spin off but I hope we get a season 2 or some sort of closing eventually for their reunion ❤
Esses caras sabem fazer trailers bons em. Essa música da muito hype sem contar que nitidamente esse é a série com o maior orçamento se comparado com os outros spin offs.
I can’t wait to have my Richonne back also I hope we can see Rick reunite with his kids ❤
Jesus, it's so goood. I watched it with biiig focus and excitment.
so hyped
Yes, Yes, Yes!!!!!!!!!!!!!
OS AMO
HALLELUJAH
Tears of joy and Goosebums 😭🔥🔥
OVER 5 YEARS LATER WE’RE FINALLY HERE
Wow got the chills yooooo it looks so awesome I wanna speed up time but time will fly by hopefully fast lol
Rick grimes 😍😍😍😍😍
😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮🤩
Can't find words....too excited 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
They aren’t showing us his left hand for a reason
MEUS PAIS ESTÃO DE VOLTA 😭
bom demais
this is the greatest looking twd spinnoff oat, and probably gonna be the best one
Rick was the soul of this masterpiece, so hyped to see him return
INCREDIBLE TRAILER!!!!! LFG!!!!
Finally Rick is back ❤
Jadis 💗
WE ARE THE WALKİNG DEAD❤‍🔥
WONDERFUL TRAILER
W trailer
ALREADY A MASTERPIECE
RICK AND MICHONNE !!!! THIS IS EPIC !!! I CANT WAIT 😁😁😁
Omg.. cant wait
John Locke ?
El tráiler se enfoco mas en Michonne, debió hacerlo mas en Rick, tenemos poco material de el desde que se fue en la temporada 9, aunque tal vez sea para mantener expectativa y sorpresas, igualmente es emocionante:)
It's been more than five years since his departure. Absolutely can't wait to see officer friendly again!
Gad  you  have  to  chioce   Rick back in  walking dead or  im become rich   God:
@1:13 Why is Atlanta getting bombed here?
Seeing Andrew Lincoln and Terry O’Quinn share the screen together is genuinely  so fucking exciting. I really hope it’s more than one season because seeing Andy do the head tilt brought back so many emotions I haven’t felt since 2019.
Shittttt 🔥
BRUTAL TRÁILER CSM, VOLVIÓ LA ESCENCIA DE TWD.
Oloco isso vai ser foda e grandioso. Rick!
Finally Rick is back
1:39 bros heading to the battle bus 💀
What about Rick hand
So is this confirmation that the little black kid is not his son lmao, he didn't say "my son" in the beginning.
SI BEBÉ, ME GUSTA
The goat is back
Why the fuck does Rick sound different?
Rick’s got that season 8 look again 🔥
Let’s Goooo! 🔥
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Where's Shane?
OMG this is just so amazing! :D
RICK GRIMES!!!!!!!!!!!!
nie mogę się doczekać aż wyjdzie !
This is not the fortnite season 6 trailer
He mentioned his wife and daughter, did he forget about his son lmao
BRING RICK HOME!!! And I need to see a reunion with Rick and any original character that's still living. Including Maggie and Daryl. Stop playing and bring Daryl home too. He belongs with Carol. And for anyone that tries to say that Daryl and Carol are like brother and sister, brothers and sisters don't say things like, 'Do you want to fool around?" OR "Don't worry, I liked you first". Those were both Carol quotes directed at Daryl😅
OH MY GAWDDDDD
1:41 who is this ? Daryl ?
Damn! This show is gonna be more intense than I thought it would be. I just need the reunion!
LET'S GO
THE GOAT IS BACKKKKKK
Oh my god . This looks phenomenal , everything in this trailer is so epic . The budget for this show is insane , I can't believe this shit is happening . I so excited for this show 🔥🔥🔥🔥 .
It's been so long, Master Grimes
Amazing, Spetacular...
Damn this was 🔥 it’s definitely movie budget and I’m excited. This is 2024 with the TWDU off to a great start.
1:39 Who is?
this is going to be amazing
O-M-F-G !!!
we need a Ground 17 reference in it. Regardless i know fine well me and the rest of the community is gonna LOVE THIS!!! <3
I forgot he doesn’t know about his son RJ
ATATSTATAT
THIS LOOKS SO EPIC.
Alright, alright, alright! 🎉❤👏🏽
TWD is back, Rick is back, We are Back!!!!
Damn ❤❤❤
❤ Lets Go!!!
A cena dos helicópteros jogando napalm é a mesma do Shane e Lori, pode ser um flashback de algum soldado ou alguém q participou
How is there so many people still alive? 😂
CANT WAIT!!! :-))))))
1:13 commonwealth?
THIS LOOKS LIKE A FUCKING BLOCKBUSTER!! I'M SPEECHLESS. I'M SO EXCITED!
I grew up watching Rick evolve from good-willed cop to brutal protector to inspiring leader. I can't wait to see how his story ends! 😊
Finalmente! Cada vez mais perto de termos o velho xerife e sua esposa em ação novamente.
Isso tá muito bom ❤
Wherever Rick has been, why have they kept him from going home?
Boss: You know why you are here              Rick: Bad luck I guess... 😂
0:22 manhatten from long island city view?
this trailer looks fire but i hate that i cant see it when it comes out (atleast legally) bcs i live in europe. :(
WE ARE SOOOOO BACK!!!!
The GOAT Returns ❤
💙💙💙
The only thing that makes for now this spinoff is that it will for only six episodes, but in reality it looks so amazing,it has so action and suspens and i hope to enjoy more than the other two only for Rick Grimes and michonne
Rick gave in
I LOVE THEM SO FUCKING MUCJH,LIKE YOU HAVE NO IDEA😭😭😭
Aeee 😮
Seeing Rick again is incredible
This looks incredible! The Ones Who Live will be the best spin-off easily! Andy and Danai are serving!
Yes! Finally!
Thank you, Grimes. Why? You showed me I can't get away... 😳😦😭💀
Finally a trailer that isn’t reused clips ! Long awaited show 👑
Thank you AMC, Andy and Dani you’re the GOATs
This looks great the budget difference compared to the main show is noticeable
Finally and I didn’t realize I would be this early to the full trailer and now after watching this trailer this show is gonna be incredible
WHOS THE SOLDIER AT THE END?
You cant kill Ricky Dicky Doo Dah Grimes the GOAT.  I am beyond hyped for this. Been watching TWD since i was 9.
ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE, CHILLS DOWN AND UP MY SPINE.
I'm so ready!!!🎉🎉🎉getting my Rick Grimes back !!!!
MICHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONNNNNNNNEEEEEEEEEEEE
Morgan at the 1:20 mark????
Insane
I’m crying so much rn god I have missed them so fucking much
Imagine realising this also in Europe
We’ve finally made it!! 6 long years of waiting will finally pay off! ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
We better have a reunion with Rick and Daryl too. Please make this happen in this show or at least in Daryl season 2 🙏
RICHONNEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
PLEASE HAVE MORE SEASONS
“Look in my eyes, sir. You tell me.” Thirteen years of loss, anger, pain, and determination in those eyes. He’s come a long way from officer friendly. It’s good to see you back, Rick.
Goat GRIMESSSSS
LETS GOOOOO
MDSSSSS
LGOOOOOOOO
Yeah Rick and Michonne are back and as explosive as ever!! I can't wait for this dynamic duo to reunite and handle business. After they reunite with Judith and Rick Jr., I hope they circle back to Daryl.
