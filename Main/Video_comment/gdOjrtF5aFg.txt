thank you guys so much for your patience and support<3 i took a much-needed break during the month of february since i didnt break for the holidays! with that break i was able to whip up this BEEFY video. additionally-- i hope you don't mind the uptick in sponsors. I make sure to do business with those who deserve it-- and FunnyAprons truly deserves it! I'm able to speak with Mert and Lillie directly, (they're really nice!!) and again they're a small business based in Australia-- and I'm their first "influencer" to help spread the word about their legit awesome stuff. No weird middle men getting in the way and watering down products into lame cash grabs. Small businesses work so much harder, so... they just do it better, yknow? So thanks for hearing me out on that, and remember to support small businesses, especially during these stressful times <3
Illy u always cheer me up ! Today wasn’t a great day but this made me laugh . Love ur videos !  :)
It kinda tastes like taxes lol
"taste like taxes" illy says calmly
Luigi touches an off iron  *screams louder than a girl child*
Haminations should do a collab with u
One time I was trying to make cookies and misread the recipe, and accidentally put a 1/4 cup of salt instead of a teaspoon. 😅
As a 12 yr old that cooks since 9 this actually helped!!
6:50 just chill out ...........after all that
was that amazing
2:30 hmmmm….this sounds familiar…..like…from a particularly well known cooking channel……hmm…
4:32 PEPPA
I LOVE MATZA BALLS
5:51 uchiha tears is crazy bro
0:40 - Took me to the third viewing to get the Chipotle line.  OR should I say "gag?"
Look I can do tacos and was able to do them at a very young age there so simple.
i hope Illy knows that she single handedly gave me my favorite recipe. i’d have never come across Matzah Ball soup naturally!! i love it!!  (making it right now and rewatching this!)
#1 Don't peel the potato; wash the potato. The peels are  a.) tasty as heck.  b.) full of good stuff.  #2 IF you need to peel the potato as a beginner, use a peeler where the handle is 90° to your working direction (formed just like a knife); you have a lot more control using this one with the support of your thumb to gauge the strength you use than just one where you pull the handle.

6:19 😐
I love green bean casaroll
your such a good singer😢
3:15 matza ball soup hits just right on a shobbas night, that rhymes
First time I did that I hurt
I can't relate with anything you experience. But I like your videos
This has been a tough week so tomorrow we will be making matzo ball soup 😊 comfort in a bowl
Where do you find this background music?
I’m hungry now
Not me taking notes on that
Once instead of 3 grams of salt for cookies, I added 130 Grams!
I have baked and made many things with my mom and yet I just eat air fried foods 3:46
GREENBEAN CASSEROLE😀😀😀😀😀
Is that tostada? 0:44
Why childeren if its not a child friendlie Chanel if you sware
1:33 never be like illy
My brother dosent teust me with garlic powder. I was macking mac and cheese, and was trying to add garlic and onion powder. You know for flaver. I added just enugh of the onion powder, but the garlic powder..... yeah lets just say i ended up needing to toss the rest because me, nore my brother could finish 1 bowl of that stuff.
So, the stone-age hand-knife hold is THE Knife hold!
Same feeling when i turned teen😭
I had 4 knives and 3 pots and 1 rice cooker and a utensil set... At the age of 11
omg i love green bean casserole
For anyone new illy is not insane she’s just like this
i love baking, and it usuallyyyy doesn't turn out bad, but the first time I made brownies from scratch I mixed up the containers and put in powdered sugar instead of flour. I laid on the floor in front of the oven and cried when i found out, but they actully didn't turn out too bad!
I’ve made a roast, homemade cookies, tofu, butter chicken and many other things but making pancakes still makes my toes sweat
Wait, is the animation😮
6:19  I giggled
4:12 i swear, this is the reality of a Dyslexic person
I need a full Soup Time and Soup Time (Reprise) from you this instant, Illy.
I love green bean casserole
6:18 6:18 6:19 6:20
bro once when I was like 12 I cut my hand on a toy potato peeler 😂  : I was a stupid kid 😅.
3:40 - Oh, THAT'S what finding a "literally me" character is supposed to feel like...
I learned when I was a teenager
I am also of Jewish descent, and I LOVED making Matzo ball soup when I was younger. It truly is super delicious and homey~!! Also, main note, your animation skills are freaking amazing!!
Soup time 1:01
How do you know what taxes taste like 0:29
i added this black powder to my eggs because i rean out of pepper. and it says gun powder. it tasted a little explosive
I started cooking when I was nine and ALMOST burned my house down. Good times 😌
5:51 hey you penne pasta in the background thank you illymations
I like green bean casserole
I like you're videos. You're very funny. I like your animation too. When I was very young I started cooking sometimes. My brother started dating a jewish girl who was very nice so I wanted to do something nice for her. I tried making matzo ball soup for real no mix. It didn't turn out so good. My matzo balls came out to the size of like softballs. They weren't very good. Anyway, you reminded me.
This vid was 4 years ago and its still good
One word, just one; OMELETTES
I was watching(listening to) this while chopping vegetables, and in the scene where you cut yourself, I cut myself as well.
3:43 not from the south but damn.
5:45 I LOVE MASABALL SOUP
What If Gordon Ramsey tasted Illy’s Mazzo balls soup?
I love the anime references
I'm 10 and I touch the stove and kinife hope I don't loose I finger soon😊
3:56  Fun fact: Bees actually have knees.
You're the first person I ever watched ❤
What is peppa doing in your soup?😘😽😻🥰😚😍
I am in love with these animated channels rn like Haminations and Illymàtion
A fourth of a tablespoon of pepper doesn't even sound like that much...
3:43 "ew green beans" GREEN BEANS ARE THE PERFECT VEGETABLE HOW DARE YOU INSULT THEM 👹👹
1:50 I can already imagine the blood coming out of that finger. 🤕
3:51 yes it isss😁
I'm literally watching this after falling on a rock on my back   But this videos healing me
AM I ONLY THE ONLY ONE THAT THINKS GREEN BEANS ARE ACTUALLY FIREEEEE🥀
Idk if i should, but i have a homemade brownie recipe i made myself over the course of 8 months that is easy, fun, and absolutely AWESOME! Would anyone like to hear?
3:39
4:23  YUJI ITADORII!! 4:38  THE TRIO :D
Maazo balls✨🥰✨
Nahhh its the dude that said *periods is not bad*meanwhile him getting a paper cut *AUUUUHIHHHHHHH MOMYYYYYY 3:44
everyone makes mistakes every now and then. one time when I was making french toast for my nephew, I added cumin into the egg dip instead of cinnamon. not good 🤮
6:15 Why do you say potatoes like that?
They needa change the teaspoons and the tablespoon, its so canon to fail
6:02 P A P A J O H N S
You know what’s better @illymation, being a contestant on masterchef👨‍🍳🧑‍🍳👩‍🍳
Don’t catch a knife when it’s falling.😅
Bro just wen't into the astral plain of matzob ball soup! how do I do that Illy PLease tell me!!!!!!
Can I add chicken to matzo ball soup? Xx
3:40 Maaz!
Balls and cockeeee ok…….😅
Is 13 too old to be scared of turning on the stove fire
Cutting yourself with a peeler... that makes two of us... and I was using it correctly. My thumb just got in the way. I should definitely try that Matzo ball soup sometime. Me and my husband are always eating the same dishes and need some to expand that, so this maybe something to try.
You mean knaidalach?
One time I tried to make brownies and somehow I forgot to add the sugar and the flour... 😢
"peppa what are you doing in my soup??"
1:31 I feel you😫

I love matzo ball soup 😍
Hai illy I am such a big fan and you inspire me everyday ❤:3.Also I am afraid to not like burn myself when turning on the stove..
I burn water
*me who has been cooking since I was 3*
I just imagine the wife and the husband in the kitchen being like the wife is like hey look at this funny apron I made and then the husband starts helping her and then they’re like let’s make this into a nice little family own company and then bang, they already got a customer
When you said it was the bees knees that dude’s face looked genuinely concerned
Here is a useless cooking tip how you can make your cookies sweeter. Do not add 16 jalapeño peppers that will make it spicy instead you want to add sugar thank you for reading this useless cooking tip.
Me and my besties have has MULTIPLE kitchen CATASTROPHES so everyone is PROBABLY better than us? ( she put a FORK in the microwave 😅)
As a person from the Midwest I agree, green bean casserole is amazing
So what are you trying to say is fear the soup?
My brother once made lemon bars the recipe said add four tablespoons of lemon juice he added four cups
I learnt how to make tea when I was 10.lm 11
Man that pinkie has been staring at me at morning I’d be a shame to *cuts finger off
Ah illy like how matzo ball soup is your meal you know how to make, For me it’s ramen🫠
Peppa what are you doing in my soup ~ illymation 2021
I would do crockpot recipes for easier meals for cooking
0:39 "Luigi if you know what's good for you don't come in here" 2:52 "and you remember what I said about your fingers..."
I love how she reuses her animation
I tried matzo balls, THANK YOU
I had to Google Matzo balls and Giiirrlllll it's a damn German dish! 😂 i'm German! It's called Matzknödel in German i guess not the easiest word for an English speaking Person. I never tried it so maybe i will give it a try in the Fuiture. If you Google Knödel and use Google Translate you can find many more Recipes. We even have other Variations of Knödel that are sweet and eaten with warm Cherrys. Enjoy 🥰
Mantsa ball soup is so good but only us news know what it is
I love green beans
I keep telling my brother that she needs to keep his fingers curled when he cuts stuff and yet he NEVER FUCKING DOES IT
i love natzaballs sm!!!
I remember when I was three years old I made a Sunday dinner (Im British btw)with my granny
no offence 😊😊
the crazy in the kitchen part-ayo
Young? 66 years old.
im hungry now good thing my moms coming home with panera bread
You are never too old to be afraid, especially when being around a stove
4:44 can’t be that bad nah what the FRICK
0:18  yeah probably…
One time, my parents put a big 5 gallon bucket of sugar... next to an identical bucket of salt..... and only the sugar was labeled.
Oh YES I LOVE MATZA BALL SOUP THE BEST PART OF ANY FAMILY MEAL
I love matzo ball soup! I always eat it for pretty much any Jewish holiday!❤❤❤❤
8:47 *in the most serious tone* no puns in the kitchen!
5:59 6:20
Gyatt-attouille~! They love the soup >w<
Eww green bean casserole eww yucky wucky I cant oh 😅 and for now on I’m singing 🎵 soup time soup time 🎵mmmh
4:45 got a solid chortle out of me.
My Filipino version of Matzo Ball soup is Chicken Adobo. Just saying the name is enough to make my mouth water. It’s easy to make too! All you need is chicken (any part) soy sauce, vinegar, whole black peppercorns, garlic, and WATER. Let it boil and then skim the surface of the marinate. Then just let it simmer for 30 minutes.  WHAM BAM you got a nostalgic Filipino dish ma’am
Soup
Hi haminations
my moms a baker so im good FIER SCARES ME I CANT BE NEER IT

4:39 omg it’s jjk
1:43  injury time😔😔
I baked chocolate cupcakes once, but I added salt to them with pre salted walnuts.
I love matza ball soup as well. It was way better than I had anticipated, and I am happy I gave it a try
Oh my God oh my God oh my God oh wait it’s not real. It just looks funny. 2:11
“issa SOUPPP”
The purple cake looks pretty good
For me, here's MY equation! Me+ my friends+ our clumsiness= DISASTER! hope you had a better time cooking than I DID!
WhY tAxEs!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!'!!!!!!!!!!!!
I’m less of a chef, and more of a baker, but I accidentally added a tablespoon of salt to a cake instead of a teaspoon. It was BAD. But I do enjoy baking a pastry from the Philippines (realizing it’s from Maine) called ensaymada. It’s basically sweet bread with cheese on top and it’s amazing!
6:19 ?!?!?
I always find myself watching until the end it could be like 2:00am and I will be just down a rabbit hole of illy
“any ingredient, any flavor, any spice, papa john’s” this was way funnier than i expected
i love green bean casaroll i get it every thanks giving!!!!
I did the same thing but with brownies! And added to much salt...
2:26 fun fact, axolotl’s could grow parts of their brain back if injury

Your channel is depressing and I weirdly like it
Illy: Papa Johns- Wait no- 2021.
Are we not going to talk about how there's a girl in the back pointing the sharp knife at her friend?
1:45 Poor Illy.
Great now soup time is stuck in my head...
3:39 OML THAT LOOKS SO GOOD WTH IS THAT GUY TALKING ABOUT 😭
the stove turning on and her going augh.
I love green been casserole my mom the best.
'hmm tastes like taxes' made me crack up soo hard
With 1/4 tablespoon of pepper... I'd love that in my green bean casserole!
7:49 jjk pic in the back
3:39 anyone see shoto trying to be sneaky
Cooking bad
As someone possibly ADHD who's struggled with cooking blunders, I've taken to simple and/or slow-cooker recipes, buy convenience ingredients like pre-chopped onion, and get ALL the ingredients ready to go first - preferably earlier in the day so the work is split up. Then all you have to do is focus on the actual cooking steps.
✨INJURY TIME✨ 😔 2:18
im 11 and im cooking already lol😅 im 13 now still cooking, my fav dish is lasangna soup😋
1:02 soup time🎶🎶🎶
0:12 why do all americans have those weird stoves lol

I LOVE GREEN BEAN CASSEROLE AHHHHH

I’m literally 9 and I can bake a cake and I can make lots of stuff
4:14  YUJI ITADORI
I once made hard boiled eggs explode.
POV: You put 3x the pepper needed in your meal for your friend group. Most of you: It's too spicy. That Yoruba friend with a higher spice tolerance than the rest of you combined: Just the right amount.
I remembered in the peeler part one time I was trying to peel a Jolly rancher and sliced a thick but small chunk of skin from my  thumb👍 good times
Everyone! (No puns in the kitchen😾) 8:48
Can I put gummy Bears in it

Green bean casserole is the best
I've watched you ever since the last 2 years of my life and I also wanna become an animator when I'm older :)
6:20 Peppa what are you doing in my soup?
If it makes you feel better one time while making a cake I put baking powder instead of baking soda in!
4:05 the best thing to add to green bean casserole is about a half tbsp of Worcestershire sauce, it makes it so goooood 😊
I love green bean casserole
A few months ago, me and my mom were making cookies. We forgot the sugar....... But we instead put in a crap ton of salt
I’m gonna use your mozzo ball soup recipe with my mom soon.
Hi❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I hope you know that for the last 3 years, that stupid “peppa what are doing in my soup” has been living in my mind rent free. Thanks a lot

I recommend you try making Indian tacos, it's super fun, easy, and has more textual components than regular tacos since it's served on frybread.
Gojo juice?🧃
I'm 10 and I know how to make mama noodles
Once I added salt instead of sugar in my tea

I love my mom’s greenbeen casserole! 😋
I love watching your videos they are honestly comforting and hilarious🤍
Don’t you mean muzz ball
I’ve been cooking since I was something less than ten. Also, you should try corn casserole, that stuff’s better.
Idk, I’m from California and I have always loved having green bean casserole at thanksgiving.
B A K I N G   G L O V E S
I grew up in the west and both of those meals are the bomb
time to account for my ~cooking ~crimes ~
SAME!!!!!!
This is why I refuse to use the proportions in the book. My eyes do the measurements. When it comes to spices, not the other parts
I remember I use to have matzo ball soup alot with my old friends, now I love it and its my life
I added Matzo balls to my chicken soup after watching this video ... I can vouch, they good
May I suggest cooking classes?
YUCKY WUCKY 😰🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤮🤮 (Joke)
I had flashbacks of the first and last time I had green bean casserole
Haminashans that sounds delicious like broccoli cookies
You got three fingers
Am I the only one that thinks even 1/4 tablespoon of pepper is wayy too little?
And u illey yall were some of the ogs for me

The subtitles called Maaz's "YuCKy wUcKY!" Yucky lucky!!!
I once added 3 tablespoons of salt instead of 3 teaspoons - the cookies didn't turn out so great.
I can't believe this isn't something you don't learn in school in America

Yummm
3:56 heck yeah sister! Green bean casserole, oh I loved that stuff, the way dad makes it was using canned chicken and canned cream of mushroom with the canned  green beans and fried onion mixed, and it’s the simplest to make yet the delicious thing to have. Crap now I want some of dad’s cooking…
did no one see the Peppa what are you doing in my soup
idk why but videos of illymation makes me feel better about myself..
I tried making cookies and it flattened so it became pancakes
I sure do love when the quirky red -head organism tries to work with efink
No
The only thing I've made without destroying it is spaghetti. Granted, I had some guidance from my mom, but it came out pretty good.
I love green bean 'cassawol'
JUJITSU KASIEN
Ok, so if you do over season something. Balance it out with something else. I once added too much pepper to some Alfredo and used Parmesan cheese to balance out the pepper
my friend cut his hand soo bad he had to get stitiches
✨PEPPA✨ what are you doing in my soup?
Cooking time! 🥳 Injury time 🥲
3:15, "I hope she made lotsa spaghetti." - Luigi, Hotel Mario
I also made the same mistake with the peeler☠
When I walked passed that magical matzo ball soup kit remembered this video, now I’m rewatching as I’m making it and eating it. AND IT IS SO GOOD!! Thank you for introducing me to this amazing soup and I love your videos!
It’s tradition for me to make mac and cheese while watching your videos!!
"Any ingredient, any flavor, any spice, papa joh- wait no-"
I'm 13 and I know how to cook!!!!🎉🎉🎉🎉 You got this! ( look up youtube tutorials )
I got food poisoning from chipola  I don’t wanna get sued #
Have you made a video explaining why you think cats the musical is good cause I don’t believe you if you haven’t, you should
Gurl I’m a child and I know how to cook pancakes, grilled cheese, mashed potatoes, spaghetti, and Mac n cheese. (P.s, those pancakes were fluffy, and sweet, I cooked them perfectly!!
I added too much sugar to cookies once...i couldn't even eat them :(
Your a good singer
Soup time soup crime🎶
I would love more videos like this! This was actually very informative and cooking is scary to me
3:54 Bro my dad makes Green Bean casserole every thanksgiving giving and Christmas! ITS SO GOOD ❤
Please stop bullying people
We always had extra matzah ball soup after Hanukkah so when I went to school I told my friends I was eating clouds
i love green bean casserole but i love every single vegetable (excluding squash) in existence so i guess don't take it from me what was the point of this again?
I hurt my finger with one of those as well
Gasp peppa what are you doing in my souppp 😂😂😂😂😂😂
hey illy this is my seventh time watching this vid and i just wanted you to know that vid has really helped me to smile during hard times thank you for being the best youtuber ever
I cant cook, doordash alert
Illy: *goes on a rant about the size of matzo balls Also Illy a minute later: and then you put the matzo balls in the water and they float! :D Weeeeeee :DDD
I am sadly mentally allergic to matzah ball soup. Very sadly.
Hi.  So, I was at the supermarket a bit ago and saw Matzo Balls and thought "Hmm, I remember Illymation talking about this and she made it sound good, I think I'll try some."  So I bought some and got around to cooking it today, and I really liked it!  Your analogy was spot-on; it literally tastes like you're eating a noodle-flavored sponge.  Definitely gonna have more in the future!
Cooking is hard
I'm 11 and I can do all those things by myself
Fat ppl want to be skinny. skinny ppl want to be fat.  ppl with curly hair want straight hair and ppl with straight hair want curly hair.  White ppl want to be black. black ppl want to be white.    the lesson is: ppl want whats not they'rs. Humans will never feel confident without someone boosting them
I'm sorry but the way she said Balls balls balls BALLS just got the meme dirty mind in my head

Luigi if you know whats good for you dont come in here, soup time, ingury time IS WHAT MADE ME CRY LAUGHING
In junior high was given a cheese making kit. I also put in 1 tablespoon of salt instead of a teaspoon! I think every cook does that at one point 🙂 And green bean casseroles are the bomb! My mom made the best
Soup time soup time🗣️🗣️🗣️🔥🔥🔥🔥

Give me that soup whatever it goes I forget, but give it to me. Yum

I LOVE matza ball soup! I always try to make it with my Mom's chicken soup during the holidays and/or the sabbath
The other day I attempted to make Chicago deep dish with pre-made pizza dough and it did not work. I couldn't even get one slice out of the dish intact.
“Eww gren beens, a casserole, yucky wucky no thank you”
W soup song
Anyone gonna talk about the soup time banger?
THiNK OF THE KIDS , DONT MAKE THE BALLS TO BIG
Too much pepper tastes bitter to me.
i live up in iowa and i love green been Casa roll
For me my "matsa ball soup" or my thing I always come back to is homemade salsa. I love trying differnet pepper combinations and seeing where the spices take me and its something I always bring to potlucks
the fact that i said no to the two questions at 2:31 says something about me
6:19 Pepper Pig Edit:Make Ramen noodles with a few sliced cheese and 1 egg
once added 1.5 teaspoons of multiple different spices to pumpkin bread instead of.5. Forgot the salt too tasted like a pumpkin spice candle
The soup time song is the best song ever. We need a full version
In 5th grade most of the girls in my class cooked for there families. My grandma never let me because the one time she did  I burnt my thumb so bad that I still have scar from it to this day
Kid who knows to cook pre teen.. * (traumatized)
Get an induction stove. Faster than gas, and no scary fire.
im so glad i started learning to cook at around 7 so when i got older cooking was ALOT easier
Illy: I'm safe with knifes  Also her: *drops the knife*
I am looking for the Aprons, but the link is bringing me to some online shoe store from China, I don't think that is it.
I love your videos 📷📷
Dont worry erryone peels theyself AT LEAST once
I remember when i was like 13 and  was helping my grandma in the kitchen with cookies and i got the flour proportions on the cookies SO wrong (like i missed 1/2-1 cup) and the cookies looked like a burnt sponge ToT
I tried Matzo ball soup. 8/10 soup. ( too much flavoring for me)
Every time I watch ratatouille it makes me want to cook. Whenever I cook I want to watch ratatouille.

When I read the title for this video, I at first thought it said, "Learning how to cook an adult". That is why I clicked on it. I was slightly disappointed when I realized it said "Learning how to cook AS an adult".
Try Tyson popcorn chicken with Marie sharps and rice. It’s amazing
She’s on the toilet 😂
"are you afraid to drop an egg into the pan despite there being barely any butter to splash on you and the stove being on low heat?!" YES! yes i am!
I feel you on the pepper.   One time, I was preparing steaks for me and my girlfriend (now wife) and the recipe for the marinade said one tablespoon of pepper. I mistook it to mean one heaped tablespoon of pepper. Thank god I got the potatoes right. 😂
Ummm I put a pop tart in the microwave once and umm let’s just say it went boom💥😂💀
I think what my mom says is very important here- Underseasoned is better than over! You can fix your unsalted dish easier than you can fix it over!  So underseason when in doubt, all you need to do later is add more
There is rumors that both your cats are trying to kill Biden dog.
mmmm taxes the cake filler
I feel as if the scared of the stove part is targeting me...
The way she talks about matzo ball soup, makes me think about the way I talk about my family's chicken papirkash recipe! It's so warm and it's my favorite dish to have. I just need to learn how to cook it 😅
6:05✨ P A P A   J O H N S ✨ *wait no-*
Ratatouille musical references ftw!!
I add uranium to my matcha balls😂😂😂😂
"1\4 table spoon".. thats a teaspoon  a teaspoon of pepper isnt that much
"hmm. Kinda tastes like... Taxes" That's why I evade them :D
I was once cutting an apple and almost sliced a nasty cut into my finger. Thank God my fimger was turned in such a way the knife hit the side of my nail
I LOVE GREENBEAN CASSAREL
as an israeli, matzo balls is called kneydalakh here, its the most delicious thing ever omfg!
I make these really good shortbread cookies with pistachios and lime zest in it and I have to remind myself everytime not to overdo the lime or else the whole batch will taste like lime and nothing else XD
Gurl stop you can't sing
Pads.
I just like how people are learning for to cook like with me im cooking at a young age aka 15 because if I start in my teens then I will have a lot more years improving my cooking skill like I made my first grilled cheese without my moms help! I still need to learn how to bake but I'm scared of the inside of the oven, it too hot. Also if you are cooking or baking with your parents watch carefully to learn from them. It helps!  I need to stop making such long things
I absolutely love my mom's mac and cheese and green bean casserole
do you add pork
I like beans
FUNNY APRONS
GREEN BEAN CASSEROLE YEAH BABY  THAT STUFF WAS GOOD!!!!!
Advice DONT USE A MANDALIN
@illymation I’m Mexican let me make the tacos 🌮
My dad's matzoh ball soup is my comfort food. He makes the matzoh balls from scratch and uses shmaltz, or chicken fat, and the fat makes alllllll the difference, seriously it's night and day.
Papa Jo…Wait no.(My favorite line of this vid)
Ngl if Illy had a discord server I would join it in a second

NOOOO DID FUNNY APRONS GO OUT OF BUSINESS??????
I haven't had issues with actually cooking food, but bring the oven or frying chicken or anything in a layer of oil I have an intense and justified fear, I've got so many burns from baking and frying
I was always taught that "If you can read, you can cook." Great advice, actually. I'm sixteen and will happily make sliders if you ask.
Anyone watching this in 2023?
my brother was at work and he was working in the kitchen plus they got new knives and he cut his finger while making some ones order and you could see the fat coming out his finger and was bloody i almost threw up seeing the picture he showed me
1:37 omg I have done this before too
I quite literally cannot cook for shit I fucked on mash potatoes 🥔 it came out all soupy 😅
Can I make Matzo Ball soup even if I’m not Jewish?
more lofi moments please. That soup meditation was totally bitching XD

I learned to make grilled cheese, pancakes and eggs when I was 8 or 9 years old
Can we just appreciate how much she does for us
i like green beans
My mom used the kosher salt that she brined the water for her goldfish tank with instead of sugar one year for her Christmas cookies.
I'm 9 and I am great at cooking 🍔🍲
Damn, been watching her for a while and just now noticing she kinda sounds like Ellen degenerate

The meggy cooking experience
"Gonna peel the potatoes"  *proceeds to cut herself trying to peel an onion*
The weird thing about cooking for me is, I'm good at it, always have been. For the life of me I don't know where I learnt how to, the first time I cooked I cooked...
get enough Chinese take away trays, about 12 should do. cooked bolognese sauce [meat/veg. go nuts]. lasagne sheets. grated cheese & cheese sauce. in the tray: cheese sheet sauce sheet cheese sheet sauce in the oven until cooked. leave on side until it's cold enough to put in the freezer. homemade ready meal
I am so lucky that cooking shows were an absolute obsession of mine back in the day.  Nonstop.   Combined with it actually being taught in school, this is one of the few adult responsibilities that I feel I actually have covered.
I made good salty waffles once it was good
Did.. that aeroplane have a butthole?
I just noticed the plane had a butthole
also should illymation make a full version of the greatest hit, of SOUP TIME, SOUP TIME
i once burned my finger but when i came to the sink to fill a bowl of cold water so i can dip the finger into it, i poured in boiling water. ouch.... wanna know how i got burned? so my tiny doggo decided it's time for him to jump on my face, when i was making oden, and the noodles just flew onto my hand. thanks jerry...
I had no idea green bean casserole was a southern thing, I have it and I'm in the midwest  Edit:  (green been)
Funny story. one time a friend of mine handed my a cookie at lunch, i tried it and it was muy bueno. Then he gave me a look that said, you just did something your gonna regret... He told me that to cookie that i just ate was 75% SAW DUST. So yeah wood tastes surprisingly good.
dude you should try baked beans, fried egg on toast beans egg toast in that order
as someone who LOVES to cook but isnt always...the best at it, i got some tips: 1. EGGS! this should be one of the first things you learn to make and master. you'll seriously learn 3/4 of the techniques you need from cooking eggs.  2. read the ENTIRE recipe before you begin...i have screwed up so many recipes because i got cocky only to find out that there's a tricky little step that I didn't read until too late... 3. in addition to the aforementioned knife tips in this video (ps. I love you illymation!) never...ever, put your knife in the sink with the rest of your dishes. I do not have a dishwasher and sliced open my finger reaching into the sink checking for silverware...just carefully scrub your knife with some hot soapy water and put it away. do not put it in the sink
Have you ever tried tattertot casserole? Mom made it and it was delicious 👌
I was the kid that started cooking at 7 years old. By the time I got into high school and started taking cooking classes, I was the kid that impressed everyone around me by knowing how to do all of the techniques already, since I had been doing them for nearly 10 years. In college I attracted my now wife  by making pizza from scratch. And now, with all of that experience and drive to cook  more complicated dishes, I've become the person that everyone among my friends and family get super excited when I cook. A few of my friends even ask me to taste their leftovers of dishes they were proud of, because they want my opinion. They know that I'll give my honest thoughts on it, and they want that so they can become a better cook. And I love that so much. A friend even asked me to take notes at her wedding on all of the food (which I did, and felt really awkward doing while I was there).  All of this to say, I love when people start learning to cook, and I especially love it when they try more difficult dishes that they weren't 100% sure they could pull off.   Last thing. The number one most common critique I give is "don't be afraid to use more salt." Most people under salt their dishes in fear of over salting. The seasoning will be great, but the under salting just leaves the dish with a little something missing. And imo, I prefer a slightly over salted dish than an under salted one.
You put me in the mood to make soup
*4:45** Famous last words*
There’s one teacher I’ve always remembered she was always pushing us to our physical limits and saying keep trying! And we did it over and over until we got it right
The only fhink I can cook as a ten years old is peel some veggies cut em lemon salt walla and I only cook milk for hot coco and I bake cakes with my parents dealing with oven 😂
One time I tried to make an apple pie, but when making the crust I accidentally used powdered sugar instead of flour. I was very sad when I pulled it out of the oven and my crust had disappeared
I went from not knowing how to cook to working in catering and doing high end events and that was an insane jump dont recommend
Help the balls sank 😰
i have cut my finger with a patato peeler
what if you have only 3 fingers AND you where born with em
My brother in law LOVES Matzo Ball Soup! And I will forever remember when he was sick and my sister and I were going shopping and she was frustrated they didn't have the soup mix at the store. She exclaimed "How can I make my husband feel better without Matzo Ball Soup!" It makes me laugh even years later
not the peppa 😭 it’s alright guys peppa is a fake pig
0:51 I want to eat that so bad
i was making brownies and i was half asleep and mis read it i added 4 cups of WATER instead of tablespoons But the directions change after u add the ingredient
I feel like we all agree that cooking is not easy…..   ┏━━       ━       ━━┓     🔴 REC      ..    ..   ..  🌼  ..     🌼     🌼        ᕬ ᕬ       ..  🌼   ..   ＼(ㅇ◡ㅇ)⊃    ..  ︶    🌼  ..    ..        🌼            🌼     ** : **       ■■■□  ┗━━       ━       ━━┛
You know what gets me the most? Every damn recipe is like "low heat" "medium heat" "high heat" and those are  LITERALLY MEANINGLESS because it depends on what you're cooking, what you're cooking with and who's writing the recipe.
My matzoh ball is my Massaman Curry. I make a huge soup pot at a time and I can eat that stuff for *days* and not get tired
When she chopped off her cartoon hand, I was flabbergasted! 😮
oh man, of all the stories in have in the kitchen, i think the one of me eating literally a spoon-full of pepper without anything else takes the cake. the best bit was that i couldnt talk correctly temporarily after it and i had a music function to attend, so that was fun trying to be section leader of like 5 other people while being unable to talk fun times
i looked at the planes backside too closely and now i cant stop laughing
I’m really curious. I grew up learning how to cook. For y’all who dont know how to cook as adults why dont you know or like why didnt you try to learn as a teen or something?
There was 2 times that while pulling pizzas out of the oven I have burned myself twice. After the second time I started to slowly have trust issues with the oven to the point I can't have anyone human or animal near me while I'm pulling pizzas out of the oven.
don't peel your finger!
Dude. Stroganoff. You don't even need to use beef - just strips of whatever the heck you've got. Throw some onions and mushroom slices in there.  Don't forget salads or sandwiches. My sandwiches are awesome. I made a guy cry for my sandwiches. And I found this base for a tofu pumpkin stir fry that was so good.
Green bean casserole is my favorite around thanksgiving 😍
I sharpen my own cheap fiberware knives and still dish wash it cause lazy. Still cuts great when I sharpen it but it does indeed dull the knife quicker. Learning to hone your knife can delay this a little before each use.
I love soup. I’m not even kidding I have a shelf in my pantry dedicated to soup, so I made matzo ball soup and it was DELICIOUS.
i’m not jewish but every time i pass the matzo ball soup packet things at the grocery store i always want to try it!
I've been cooking for a while mostly I just helped my grandma and one time when I was making breakfast muffins I accidentally added too much salt and no amount of sugar on top could save it
Other title: needing to cook for kids but not knowing how
the part of the video talking about the terms and conditions part of being an adult gave me a much needed reminder I’m not the only one so confused and overwhelmed by all these newer responsibilities.
Green been casserole is very good
im 14 and know how to cook many things self taught, its honestly not that hard. Find a recipe, do it. i make hot cocoa almost every day -COUGH- unhealthy -COuGh-; ANYWAYS. its a spoonful of cocoa powder, a table spoon of coconut sugar, and like a cup or 2 of milk -however much cocoa u want lol-
I put 5 cups of salt in my food
Okay Ellie I'm giving it a chance. I got the matzo ball mix sooooo you better be right lol
Mmmmm
Am 11 years old and know how to cook also am still a learner so if a 11 year old can do it so can you 🙂❤

One time I added a cup of salt to some muffins instead of a teaspoon 😂

7:02 is your fridge a homunculus?
Once my sister added 3 3/4 cups of sugar to cookies instead of just 3/4 cups. Easy to say that we did not eat those cookies
Um I know you probobly wont see this but in general it's a better idea to turn the stove on and then put a pan on it cuz when the scary explozion happens if there is a pan it will make it go further

I am Jewish and from Israel,  in Passover we eat Matzaballs  and we call this Knedala'h Soup. We make this by crushing Matza bread which we also eat in Passover. (Just in case u didn't know :) )
my parents after, i turned 16 made me cook every Wednesday. just so I could learn how to cook for when I moved out and thank god they did. although i cook on induction so i don't have problems with gas stoves.
I do love cooking but you forgot the second most important thing behind safety and that is hygiene.  If you don't practice hygiene two this will happen.  1. No one will want to eat your food 2. And, more importantly, people could get sick so be cautious.  Realistically you already knew that but I just wanted to contribute to this topic and hope you all have a good meal.
Love this! I’ve been cooking for a long time and grew up working in my family’s restaurant but my confidence in cooking still gets depleted sometimes! Cooking beloved family recipes (especially easy ones,) is a great way to feel better about your cooking skills and remind yourself of what you’re capable of ❤
Don't use God in vien in Jesus Christian almighty name

"Don't make the balls too big, think of the children" - Illy, 2021
My parents taught me how to cook as a child and we (as in my siblings) made dinner quite often so I don't have to worry about learning to how to cook at least. I'm dyslexic though (although I can read fine now), and when I was about 10 or 11 I was making cookies or pancakes or something like that and I used salt instead of sugar because I couldn't read the label but I knew that sugar started with s.
you only had enough when delivery driver know you by name :))
My dad said he wanted mittens? Idk hoe to spell it i wil buy from thst site
Thsts why i learned how to cook at 1 year old
i learned how to cook at 8...
Sure, I may have set my oven on fire making cookies once, and mushrooms in whisky sauce was a questionable choice, but my family recipe matzo ball soup is STELLAR.
Pumpkin spice motza ball soup
I remembered putting a box of cornstarch to make a cake.....  It did not end well...😅

Imagine while cocking u have a kid watching this🤣
Either you have 3 fingers or 6 fingers or 9
Waiting for „soup time” to be released
funny aprons died rip
My rules for cooking: As long as it's cooked through... it's safe to eat.  Well, it's a good place to start at least
And roll never hold one more kits and roll never hold your knife like Michael be dangerous so don't don't hold your knife like Michael Myers cooking in the kitchen dangerous
I always watch illymations videos ads for more than 5 seconds to make sure she gets the monitozation for it bc ily-mations edit: YES I KNEW U WAS GONNA SAY MATZO BALL SOUP BC IT WAS MY ANSWER TO THT QUESTION TOO
I don’t celebrate Christmas, so I have a tradition with my family to go to the jewish deli/diner near me. One time, I ordered a side of matzo ball soup, thinking it was mozzarella, and I hated it. But, a while later, I learned about matzo ball soup and loved it so much more than the first time.
Bruh I accidentally set my hair on fire making waffles and I'm still not scared of the stove. I also constantly forget to tie my hair up even though after that incendent, I said I would always remember (it's not like my hair gets in the food, just the fire lol) However I do refuse to deep fry ANYTHING because once I was making donuts for my sick dad and got the hot oil in my eye and was blind for like 2 days straight all while tears constantly poured out of it like I had just been to 3 separate funerals.
Best advice is that the whole “measure twice cut once” applies to food too. Read that recipe and reread it over and over and over again as many times as you have to as you’re going along doing it to make sure you have it right. I’ve never been diagnosed with dyslexia but words don’t always word correctly for me so I often times find myself reading the recipe as I’m prepping for it and while actually cooking the thing. My memory is also shot and I’ve baked one too many cakes without egg to understand why I need to be fully aware of what I’m doing
my mom makes Green bean casserole and it's so good everytime.
I’m sorry if this seems childish butttt  Balls te he
she said “hiss” and i got an ad for a romance comic on canvas
Mozzoball soup 3:15 is good every Jewish family has their own recipe

I have never heard of Matzo balls before today and now I feel like I've been missing out
By the way, I love green bean cassarole!And I always eat it when my mom makes it!
Wow
Where is your thumb nail art style different than your animation artstyle
I would try the matzo ball soup but i hage a jewish grandma and idk if i could ever live uo to HER matzo ball soup.
this reminds me of the first time i made cookies and used the wrong amount of SALT… I was too proud to admit it, but they were SO salty 💀😅😂😂
To those of you who are just embarking on your lifelong journey of learning how to cook, you're gonna have so much fun! I am so excited for you and proud of you! You're going to learn so many things that will satisfy your curiosity for flavor. As Miss Frizzle would say, "take chances!, make mistakes!, get messy!". Honestly, getting messy is the funnest part. I am going to leave you with a favorite quote of mine, "if you don't know how to cook, then you live at the mercy of those who do".
u are an absolutely fabulous youtuber, ur art style and energy are so awesome i love it.
“Any ingredient any flavor any spice papa jo- wait no”.  6:02         Peppa what r u doing in my souwp? 6:19       “No puns in the kitchen👹”  8:46
how do you make the matzo ball?😅
lol as a Jewish Israeli teen I couldn't explain matzo balls better it's literally a sponge that soaks all the flavors
I’m from the Midwest Ond my mom makes green been casserole all the time it’s SO GOOD
If anyone sees this. The way to make nice garlic bread without fresh garlic is to use garlic powder, Italian herb mix, lotta butter, fresh pepper, a little garlic salt, and a tiny bit of salt. Make sure your bread is a long loaf with a nice crust. Put it into the oven set at 350 F while the oven is cold, and cook until he crust is how you like.
But green bean casserole😢 its so good
❤❤❤😮😮😮😊
Best video to appear in recommend after I made a homemade smash burger

The Soup Time Song Is Great
I've been cooking since my mid-teens; inspired by my mom's cooking. And ever since this summer after moving into a new house with my dad and sister, I started cooking way more. Almost every week. I've cooked chicken and waffles, cheesecake, borsch, brisket, and pasta dishes. It is a lot of fun exploring new dishes and brainstorming ways to plan batches of meals for a low cost. One piece of advice I can give you, Illy, and anyone else reading this (which I should have learned way sooner) is to never overcomplicate things. Last month, I attempted to make those viral potato noodles. The recipe calls for one part potato to one part cornstarch. It took A LOT of work. Boiling the potatoes, mashing the potatoes, mixing the starch, boiling the noodles, and chilling the noodles. Kneading all of that dough was exhausting. And once I tasted the noodles, they were not good. No amount of sauce could obscure that strong taste of cornstarch. Plus, I bought the wrong kind of squash to go with it as the skin made it too tough to eat. So, yeah.
6:22 I do not remember this part 😂
illy- I know what you're thinking eww green bean casserole. Me- I LOVE GREEN BEAN CASSEROLE!!!!!!!!!
I’m a proud mega fan of green bean casserole ❤
I use Japanese knives. Bought them for work originally. They get washed and dried with every use or they rust quicker than a run to the bathroom after Taco Bell.
Amen ❤
i love chicken but i also have chicken anxiety so i NEED to chop chicken into a million pieces so i KNOW it’s cooked all the way theough
I don't like all my finger out i wanna keep them (i have bbef with thumb and pointer)
OH MY GOD MATZO BALL SOUP IS MY FAV SOUP EVER!! I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT AND WHEN MY MOM MAKES IT I ALWAYS ASK FOR EXTRA MATZO BALLS ( Btw great video, I love watching you and every one of your videos is an absolute banger !!! )

I love cooking and my favourite food is pot noodles my favourite dish I made in school was honey cake
If you need/want tips I can give you a couple!! I learned to cook at around five, with baking. In fourth grade my math class taught me about reading recipes and the abbreviations for measuring spoons when we were working with fractions. So by the time I was around 10 I was cooking dinner on sundays! I’m a pretty good cook and my family loves it when I do. Except when I make tomato soup. My sister doesn’t like me when I make it, everyone else loves the soup, though!!
Here's a pro tip from someone whose been cooking since I could reach the countertop, and I'm tall af so that was young.    Never pre-emptively apologize for your food. You think you put too much pepper? Not enough salt? Don't care say nothing unless it's a warning about an allergy. You saying you think it's bad will set the person testing it up to think it's bad. If you say nothing, they'll assume it was intended to taste like that, and appreciate it for what it is, instead of being disappointed because it's not what it could be.
I love green bean casserole anyone who didn't grow up and the south or southwest doesn't get it!
Add chessar cheese to your green bean casserole. Trust me it's good.
I only make grilled cheese for lunch but no dad I don’t have a addiction to grilled cheese
My favorite memory of this video is the notification for this showing up while my freshman cooking class was watching Ratatouille 🤣🤣
one of the most unhinged videos LOOL
I've been cooking with my dad since I was a embryo and I love it we have the best pancake recipe that is a family recipe  and man they hit different
“injury time, injury time, time to account for cooking crimes…”, “hmm… kinda tastes like taxes.” - Illy, 4/25/21
Guys follow illys rules or else she will come and chop off your fingers in 1 second you won't even see
I was cooking French toast, and I burned my hand when I was flipping the French toast.

i love illy she would be fun to hangout with 😃
One time when I was 10 I made grilled cheese on the stove HOW
Any ingredient, any flavor, any spice, papa Johns.. WAIT NO
I LOVE GREEN BEANS💚
Fun fact I almost blew up my house while cooking we have a gas stove I turned the gas on the highest volume and tried to light the stove the room was full of gas and if I had lit that stove I would not be alive today so that’s why I stick to takeout 😀
So I am 10 and I just made a peanut butter cookie and let me tell you that's kinda fire
I nearly took my fingernail off with a potato peeler. Thankfully it didn't reach to the nerves, but it came CLOSE.
I speak roughly to by little boy, and I beat him when he sneezes... 'cause he can thoroughly enjoy, the pepper when he pleases.  Wow wow wow. 😁 Alice's adventures in wonderland...
I peeled my finger with a peeler like that not to long ago
i tried to make millionaire shortbreads and it was a success but god a bite gives you diabetes
I love green beans
The first time i saw matzobale soup was in transylvania 1 and i didn't even know what it was i just thought it was fake screaming food
TIP FOR YOUR MATZAH BALLS   Don’t mix the eggs and oil whisk it alright make that sh’’t fluffier than the fluffiest cloud alright ? If it doesn’t look like you could get the best sleep of your life in it it’s not ready and by fluffy I mean bubbles get all the air in the eggs makes them less stiff also I don’t make mine golf bad sized personally I make them bigger than my fist and they cook all the way for me oh I LOVE matzah balls especially when it’s soup season and I’m making them for Shabbat 🤤 they’re warm and fluffy and just sooooo good personally I don’t cook mine in the soup but I’m a separate pot and add it to the soup afterwards 🥰
Thank you. I need to have the courage to try and cook more.
Illy, I have a soup recipe that I just made randomly that is really good and is a comfort food soup! You might like it.
One Time a few years ago when I was 18 or 19 I was making chocolate chip cookies. And when added the vanilla extract to the batter and put the cookies on the tray to bake they looked… off. And when they we’re cooking they looked weird. That’s when I checked to see if I added everything, but when I looked at the extract I saw it wasn’t vanilla it was LEMON!! 🤮 So yeah that was the first and only time I ruined cookies
I can agree I’m not good at making macaroni and cheese. The cheese part of the mixture always comes out liquidy even though I did everything correctly! 😣 1:13 OOF.
i added 11 teaspoons of salt instead of 1 1/2 teaspoons of salt to bannana bread once
I can make the BEST french toast and cheese omelette with the same ingredients! Nothing wasted just remember to lower the heat when adding a new slice of bread of it WILL TASTE BITTER

I’m not even from the south and green bean casserole is my absolute favorite.
i only have 1 finger and both of my hands put togeter
Fajita filling is surprisingly easy to make, it’s basically chicken, pepper and ✨spices✨
My grandma used to make matzo ball soup for me when I was younger😭❤
Famous last words “yea thats a lot of pepper man” I only know how to make eggs bacon pancakes breakfast burrito and pizza
Matzo balls kinda sounds like tofu

Hey my family loves green bean casserole but its OK because you didn't know OK 😊 ❤ (◍•ᴗ•◍)❤
Pepa what are you doing in my soup❤😮😊

when i help my dad make food, i just ask for everything that we have in the kitchen to be put in it, of course within reason
4:07 ah good ol' great depression food
Peppa what are you doing in my soup  Me p p hahaaaaaaaa
" gonna peel the potato "  Nah , gonna peel my skin
I remember we had to do cooking classes in 6th & 9th grade   At one point the teacher told us to go out in the forest and grab some herbs! 😆   Honestly I very good idea! Everyone should lesrn how to cook, even if its just a few meals. Definitely prepared me for when i had to leave for school at the age of 16
I have already made foods like cheescake and my favorite, ravioli, and I'm just 19 😎
My mom hates cooking and we all hated her food when we were little so one day she told us that if we were to eat what we wanted, we'd have to make it. I was around 7 at the time so I couldn't make meals by myself, but my mom and my siblings helped. It was a win-win situation; we got the food we wanted and Mom didn't have to cook anywhere near as much. Ten years later and I can cook a ton of stuff and it shocks me when I meet people that don't know how.
Aaw this is the most wholesome sponsor I've seen 😊😭
Your videos are great to watch. Because they teach people of all age lessons about life ❤
a few days ago I forgot and accidentally held a loaf of bread I was cutting with a bread knife by the bottom and whaddaya know-- I cut my hand and it bled and it still hasn't completely gone away after almost a week. also I learned that apparently I now almost faint when I get a little booboo  I've literally broken my arm and the worst I did was cry a lot but while I was like "oh ok I should put a bandaid on that" I got so dizzy and my stomach felt so weird I had to sit down so I wouldn't faint like what?? I wasn't even freaked out and it seriously wasn't bad it was not very deep at all
My rule for cooking: always double all the spices except salt. A tablespoon in place of a teaspoon is three times. That’s too much.
I'm not a pill potatoes that I'm 7I know how to cook marshmallow that can cook French toast and a cake by myself

Me who helps me dad cook and knows how to cut at the age of 10
okay but can we talk about what a bop the soup time song is
I can’t believe you didn’t credit Maaz for voice acting. How dare you? :)
One day I tried to make brownies lol my brain was not working that day. I thought: okay.. 1 and 1/2 teaspoons.. umm were is the 1/2 teaspoon wwiat if 1+1=2 then if I do 4 whole teaspoons it will make a 1/4 teaspoon.. yeah.... that will work.. (it didn't work) so salty😂
Funny aprons should be real popular. Those look awesome! 😊
MATZO BALL SOUP IS THE BEST THIS A MATZO BALL STAN ACCOUNT ITS THE BEST TASTE EVER AND THEYRE SUCH A SENSORY YES I COULD EAT IT FOREVER AND NEVER BE BORED IM STEALING UR RECIPE YEEEEESSSSSSSS I DOMT CARE IF THIS WAS 2 YEARS AGO AND YOU PROBABALY WONT SEE IT ILLY BUT I DONT CARE I LIVE FOR MATZO BALL SOUP 😩👍
soup recipe beef shaped as a ball carrots corn potatos and tomatos also salt and pepper
I accidentally cut my finger with a potato chip thing, cutting a mango… it’s healed but there was a lot of blood and now I have a ugly looking scar
I just made my own simple dinner today❤❤😋😋🍳🍳🍜🍜🥰🥰 And i’m just 13 years old.
this taught me how to cut stuff 💗
Pepa what are you doing in my soup
Frozen tofu is kind of like matzo balls, kind of
omg one time i used tablespoons instead of whatever the other one was... the carrot cupcakes were RADIOACTIVE
You said chicken but you added a picture of a turkey
this makes me think about that one time where me and my friend put 1 kg of sugar (2 pounds ) in a cake because the balance was broken
"huh! Peppa! What are you doing in my soup👁️👄👁️?"
Who doesnt like green bean casserole!?
You know her
Matzo ball soup and green bean casserole are the bee's knees and I am nether southern or Jewish. LOL Also I lit water on fire once while cooking so... ya, you can't be as bad as me.
Be super careful with mandolins and always use the hand guard!!  I thought it wasn't necessary to use the guard to just chop an onion then my hand got too close and ...  I am now missing a part of my finger tip :/ ALWAYS USE THE GUARD PROVIDED!!!

I forgot to ad sugar and salt to homeade ice cream once 😅
My grandmother’s red velvet recipe is my all time favorite. We try to make it every time I visit her.
I'm definitely a "learned to cook as an adult" person, I didn't really start making meals for myself until I was 20 and got off my school's dining plan, and it... it can be a lot. A lot of tragically burned garlic ruining dishes. But last year I perfectly replicated my dad's matzo ball soup recipe for the first time and it was one of my proudest cooking moments :)  The secret ingredient is mushrooms, it's what makes it better than any other vegetarian matzo ball soup out there. Even if you're using chicken broth, toss some mushrooms in there, it'll be great
Once while I was making cookies I was watching a video on how to make, the cookies this is what hear “Add 2 tablespoons of salt” me: adds 2 TABLESPOONS of SALT video person “ oh wait sorry add 2 teaspoons of salt”
2:33 And if I dont?
@Haminations  One time I added 2 cups of salt to my cookies instead of 2 tea-spoons. 😥
I once burned kraft dinner
Green bean casserole is good af
I remember when I was making Mac n cheese, and i thought it said “1/4 tablespoon of butter…. N O LIKE GOD NO IT WAS TEEEEEEEESPOOOOONE AND IT WAS SO BUTTERY. 😭😭😭😭 I still ate it all but like 😅 I did some extra work in rock climbing that week. 😌👍
I JUST NEED TO LEAN THE VOEN AND I CAN COOK
Ah, joy! The legendary oat bread I cooked lovingly on a school outdoor bound, and thanks to misunderstanding the instructions it was saltier than the Dead Sea!
Moral of the story  Remember to Make sure Peppa is not in the soup your cooking
I can back properly by my self im 13😊
i been cooking since i was 9-8 and i a was basicly able to cook almost everything by 12

If anyone wants to learn to cook you have to practice your knife skills. You don't don't have to be a 5⭐ chef but know what the knives are for and how to use them   Channels i also recommend  You suck at cooking  Binging with babish(especially his basics series)  Joshua Weissman  Nicko's kitchen  The one pot chef

1:36 It’s “Soup Time (Reprise)” lol
2:53 …😨
Anyone can cook.. put except Jamie Oliver
Hey Illy I just wanted to say thank you, both for the amazing videos and for giving me the courage to try matzoball soup. Due to several issues and past experiences I have a hard time trying new things but hearing you talk about it and genuinely liking it I decided to give it a try and absolutely loved it. Also I do have a question for you: While making the matzo balls I noticed they smelled like crushed up saltine crackers, though when I brought it to my grandma she said it smelled like tuna, so I was wondering what it smelled like to you?
holy wow she has a great voice!!!
Hi here is a biscuit recipe from my grandma!!  Ingredients  1 1/4 cups of Milk  2 1/2 cups of Self rising flour  1/3 cups of Crisco (or vegetable shortening)   Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Sift flour into a large bowl. Add crisco and mix with hands till the mixture looks like sand. Gradually add the milk. Mix the dough until it’s a thick glue texture (chunks are normal). Butter a glass pan and add your dough. It usually makes 5 or 6. Bake in the oven for 40-45 minutes or until the the sides are golden brown. THE NEXT PART IS IMPORTANT. After the biscuits are out. Get a plate (I recommend ceramic plates) cover the pan with the plate grab the sides and flip over pan. If the biscuits don’t fall out the first time. Shake the pan a little. Wait for it to cool and enjoy.
I watched one video of yours..... now I'm nine videos deep and subscribed (help)
The trick to green bean casserole is using canned green beans. Fresh ones make the texture worse
Another rule with knives: don’t try to catch them, even though you have the confidence to do so.
I love knifes my gift for my sixth birthday was a hammer a machete and a pocket knife but I have still several times hurt myself with a dull knife, I CAN NOT stress how important it is to sharpen your knives.
One time, I put 1 tablespoon of baking soda inside of a mug cake when I only needed 1 teaspoon
My fish thing I cooked, was a breakfast sandwich with eggs and bread 😊
0:11 this made me crack up
Oh no not the dishes and not ‘the sound’ of the stove oh no
I was blessed with having one Grandma who could cook in one Grandma who can dance so unless you had that I'm so sorry for your loss
I was raised in a Tennessee family and I still can't eat green bean casserole.. I love the ingredients, but not thrown together like that. 🤐
I don't get hurt with knives easily. I've been out in the woods of my parent's house with a knife many times, since the age of 8 or 9.
My sister thought baking soda was sugar for cookies. Tasted burnt.
(-{[6:56]}-) TBH, that looks delish!
I’ve been cooking since I was 11 years old and for some reason I’ve never had a problem
lol I'm 10 and I can make a full meal by my self. Its ok, my mom's friend is the same as you. Anyways, it's only a simple variety of stir fry's.
How much pepper you put in your seasoning?
If anyone has a hard time figuring out teaspoon and tablespoons I use a stupid method. Tea cups are smaller and tables are big😅
Luigi, if you know what's good for you, won't come in here
My mom made me get a Betty Crocker cookbook when I moved out because it covered the basics.  She was right.  I have since added other cookbooks and various tools.
In all the videos where Amazzing is in one of Illy`s videos he gets so picked on, its great.
Instructions unclear I put a rat in my soup

Gondi is that you?
I like making tortellini soup! It's pretty simple too. Just cook some garlic, meat, and onion then add in all the rest of the stuffs. Let that simmer and then add the tortellini, let that sit and it's done! It's also fucking delicious

No offense, I’m not trying to criticize any of your cooking or your skills, but some of the food looks like  something American soldiers would eat in Poland while are Nazi paratroopers parachuting down in their area in 1942( 0:51 ); Most of your dishes look good though!
PeppA
Whoa man this cake tastes like taxes 🤤
3:34 for as long as I’ve been alive my grandpa has had half a thumb on his right hand because of an accident in the kitchen with a knife. Bro chopped his thumb of cutting lettuce or something. I’ve always been horrified of knife accidents in the kitchen/ using knives incorrectly and unsafely for this reason alone
As a caigen here, the seasoning in the green bean casserole is everything!
"peppa...what are you doing in my soup? 😏"

Who else went and made matzo ball soup after seeing this video?
I LOVE GREEN BEAN CASSEROLE!!!!!
I was fine with knives but now I’m scared of losing fingers 😅
Time 1.52 me to
Ummm it’s BOBA TEA not milk tea
Hey Illy, idk if you'll ever see this but you should make a video of you making mac sticks
The potato peeling joke reminded me of how recently, my friend randomly texted me saying that he managed to cut his hand 3 times while cutting potatos
*also me growing up in the south and not liking green bean casserole* … sue me
But you’re still are in the south 3:49

Wow, Bryson.
I'm 11 and in my family my mom taught me how to cook. And I love experimenting with different foods once me and my friend put a bunch of stuff together and we made muffins! They where really tasty and it's so fun making my own recipe's 😄

Omg pepa what are you doing in my soup
I grew up and still live in Minnesota and love green bean casserole
Heres a quick story of my first plate I cook and it was a total Disaster!.   i was still going to school at that time and when it was lunchtime i just go to my home to lunch, but that day my mom had to do go to medic so it was on me to prepare lunch.  The first thing I cook was some simple rice, easy right?, just put some water on the pot, put the rice and let it cook. Except I put COLD WATER TO THE RICE, and let the Boil for HOURS!... I was so confuse cause my mom do the rice in 10 minutes and flawless every time, and Here I am boiling the rice for Hours with cold water!... In the end just decide turn off the kitchen, and finished with a strange goo thing with a whole block of vegettable seasoning so it was a green goo.   Luckily I have some Poison resistance and dont get ill for my frist try to cook rice. After my mom come back  she sees the aberration and she wonder how in the world was posible that i created that thing. I told her and she start lauging and told me you need to boild it in HOT WATER and only for TEN MINUTES!.  IN ANY MOMENT HAPPENS IN MY MIND THAT I NEED HOT WATER TO COOK RICE!, In the end I learn my lesson and now im a master coocking rice and other things.
It took me 2 months to realize matzo ball were just bakso
3:04-8:11. 💞💛💚
my wife's approach to learning, she would look up recipes on websites that had reviews and comments for the recipes.  so she could see how well liked they were, and read for hints like 'has too much sugar" or 'use half the salt'
2:16…….be aware of what’s real…got it!
Also I hate it when people distract me when I’m cooking. My parents were getting on me for making sweets and my microwave snack was inedible cos I put in too much baking powder
I can cook easy meals and some other stuff, but I will admit I’m too much of a scaredy cat to use the blender
No puns in the kitchen
Lugi don't come in here if you know its best for you" lol
just turned 18. i still keep ordering stuff. and suck at cooking
As someone who moved to the south with my family at age nine, I absolutely hate green bean casserole and nothing can change my mind on it
Greebean casserole is really good. So is broccoli casserole.
5:17 I GREW UP WITH THIS MEAL TOO AND I STILL LOVE ITT 🤤
I somehow accidentally used 4 CUPS of salt instead of 4 teaspoons of salt for cookies, Let’s just say that my body was about 57% salt that day
🍜🎶Soup time soup time 🎶 🍜
No cuz that matzo ball soup looks so good and reminds me of my nanas homemade soup a bit omggggg
tastes like taxes 😭
Y’all I just made Matzo ball soup and it was 🔥

i love green bean casserole
I burned my kitchen...
I'm a kid a KID and I now haw TO COKE
Another tip never lift the blade off the cutting board instead rock it back and forth (except with small knives?
Another important reason in having a sharp knife is, you have higher chance of reattaching a severed digit, given you promptly get it on ice.
I’m a pyromaniac and I’m afraid that the stove is going to explode  And also I made Mac n cheese once but I forgot butter and milk but that was bc I was being rushed
2:15 I can't believe you just assumed that I'm not a cartoon character
"Hmm, what a weird filling tastes like taxes"
"YUcKy WuCkY, no thank yOu 😔"
Soup time🎉🎉🎉
You are my favorite YouTuber💗💗
My mom cut off the tip of her ring finger chopping potatoes. She called her father and he must have been drunk because he said "It's just some meat in yer potatoes." (He is extremely country)
Just become..... Peppa pig
…. I keep forgetting to sharpen up the knifes I have at home…
jest add love to it
I figured out how to make the matzo balls for scratch it literally just flour and egg
I was making ice cream, and I thought it said 1 1/2 tablespoons when it was actually 1/2 teaspoon. It was pretty salty…
One time I was cooking cookies and I double TRIPPLE checked how much flour to add and it said 2 tablespoons or something when I took the cookies out of the oven and they were basically warm cookie dough so I checked AGAIN and it sad 2 cups AND 2 tablespoons or something I was so mad but now I can cook some pretty good cookies
I have been watching your videos for 2 years
Hello illymation
Illy, are you Jewish???
Omg matzo ball soup on passover omg amazing!!
Soup time song is a bop
One time a brownie recipe called for 1/8 teaspoon of salt. Someone (me) may have (did) put 1/8 of a CUP of a salt instead...
If ur watching the vid rn, happy matzoball soup holiday! (Passover)
I found a strategy for cutting into foods like apples with a knife. I will lightly sway the knife on the apple until it slips through, then the knife or apple won’t slip away.
I almost cut my finger off trying to cut open a pomegranate with a DULL blade! Yummy… my mom wasn’t impressed.
chicken noodle soup but with NOODLE BALLS (also yeah green bean casserole is deeply underrated it so good)
“Poor mans spaghetti” is my matso ball soup. Something comfy i can make anytime with whatever. Scallions, diced tomatoes, whatever. I don’t have to add meat if i’m too scared to cook meat
My sister made green bean class once but she didn’t strain the green beans. We had green bean soup that night.
ate matza ball soup for dinner tonight
I have had mosaball soup before! I didn't even know what it's called because I didn't get the recipe from the lady, BUT now I can make for myself 🎉😆
6:00 [snicker]☺
Is Lilly nation a furry beacuse her obsession with cats The musical ❔❔❔❓
Lol I went to the store today looking for matzo ball mix and no one knew what it was and the store itself didnt have any :(
I finally got to make matzo ball soup too today and it’s delicious the matzo balls look like bread after cooked but are so soft when you bite into them
i once put 2 sticks of butter, and not two tablespoons of butter in a cookie cake. worst mistake of my life.
Gonna make matzo ball soup 👍💙
You’re the only person that I have seen who actually can make matza ball soup! Wahoo (My friends think it looks weird)
My parents try and try again to get me to eat matzo ball soup it’s kind of traditional because I’m Jewish. I like normal matzo thank you there crackers but it’s just well bread in that shape and I love it.
I know this is two years old and there's little chance you'll read this, but as someone who has prided herself on being a pretty dang good cook since she was in high school, I also completely botch dishes from time to time.  The absolute worst was when we were out of heavy cream needed for my fave noodle dish, so I threw in condensed milk... SWEETENED condensed milk!  We all tried so hard to eat it. We tried to pretend it wasn't the greatest abomination found on a plate of pasta, especially since we weren't doing great financially at the time, but it tasted so terrible we couldn't choke it down and finally just had to order takeout😅
I hate it when you add to much ground beef when you are making cookies
We always ate green bean casserole for thanksgiving growing up. I miss it now.
I tried cooking but it's extremely hard to stir Mac and cheese when you have pyrophobia
I love green bean hot dish but not casserole cause I’m from the midwest
This matzo ball soup stuff sounds like my go to favorite, Chicken and dumplings, on steroids! A little crisco, a little chicken, carrots, celery, peas, and a thick and creamy broth and it is like heaven in a bowl!
Izzy starts a cooking show
5:09 I burst out laughing at that for like a minute straight
wanna make your greenbean casserol wayyyyyy better? for every can of soup, add 1/8tsp of smoked paprika and (if your recipe does not call for it) 1 tsp soy sauce. Remove the salt in your recipe if you use soy sauce. And dont use the low sodium stuff. eww.
At one point I put 1/2 tablespoon as opposed to 1/2 teaspoon of baking powder in pancakes
Don’t make the balls to BIG?!?
I love green bean casserole
Did anyone else notice the surger spice and chemical x
Once when I made bread I added wayyyyyyy to much salt and accidentally made play dough i was like 6 but I had made bread many times before, it gave my parents a good laugh. Or how about I was making butter chicken and added a tablespoon of cayenne pepper because I hadn’t used it before and it didn’t smell spicy (I rely on my sense of smell while cooking) I don’t have good spice tolerance but out of pure bullheadedness I ate half my bowl. Or here’s one from my mom once when making a smoothie the blade got stuck on an extra frozen piece of fruit she decided to stick her finger in the emersion blender and accidentally pressed the on button she nearly chopped off the tip of her finger and scared the living daylights out of 12 year old me.
One time I was baking a special cake for my sister’s 16th birthday and I accidentally added a tablespoon of baking soda instead of a teaspoon like I was supposed to… luckily I caught the mistake before I put the cake in the oven and after researching a bit what that would do to the flavour (a quick Google search told me it may or may not taste like soap) I ended up just tripling the whole recipe. End result: our kitchen looked like a cake factory and my family has not stopped teasing me about this almost 5 years later.
6:05✨ Papa Jo- ✨ *wait no-*
My mum likes to tell me a story whenever I mess up at cooking, she had tried to make cookies one time when she first started cooking/baking, but she accidentally used powdered sugar instead of flour, (they do look an awful lot alike, plus she didn’t taste it before adding and mixing it in.) You can imagine they didn’t smell too good as they roasted in the oven. She didn’t eat the hard black bricks they became, either.😅
2:22 these are both the proper way to hold a knife, it just depends how much pressure you need to apply. The one with the check mark is for precision and control. The one with the x is for cutting large and thick ingredients, think eggplant or large cuts of meat when you want to cut up the bone as well.(use a cleaver when cutting up bones)
1:17 i literally got the same injury on my thumb when I was peeling some apples for apple sauce. ( the apple sauce was delicious btw)
I don't think I've ever had matzoballs before. Maybe because we don't have it in our stores. Or maybe we do it just has a different name is my language.
I was cooking at 5 I'm 10and can make soup and Mexican food
Sooo now I have to try this soup. The closest connection I have to this is when in hotel transylvania Adam Saddler gave his pregnant daughter Monsterball soup. And that's it. Sooooo I'm gonna have to try this it sounds amazing. I love dumpling things in soups. Like when people drop biscut dough into soup! I love that. And also, I can't cook and have massive cooking anxiety. What other activity can combine your fear of never being good enough for your parents, your fear of hurting yourself, and your fear of disappointing yourself bc your standards are toxicly high? Just cooking. At least, that's the only one I've found. I do not go outside. So yeah. This speaks to me. And I have to make this friggin soup.
✨Peppa✨ What are you doing in my soup? 💅
I had to teach myself how to cook. My family did this religious fast thing and I realized “well we probably have to learn how to cook because we’re about to starve”. Somehow SOMEWAY I was able to pass my food prep class with an A despite how I’ve been doing this for years and I still don’t know what I’m doing 😂
illy are you jewish because matza ball soup is made for passover a jewish holiday anyways  i love your vids and your animation so keep it up😄😃
My faqs teacher almost cut her finger off because she was applying to much pressuse
“Any ingredient, any flavor, any spice, papa johns, WAIT NO-“
Shes 24 and islike I cooked in collage well when I was   was maeing tacos umm yeah dont cut youre hands off kids
pepa

But, wait. I grew up on green bean casserole, and I'm not from the south... MY WHOLE LIFE IS A LIE....
I don't know why but her saying ''peppa'' just triggers me so much 6:18
First sponsorship I didn’t skip
Okay but like, green-been casserole is freaking delicious.
Can’t relate  I still love this video though ❤️

It's funny teaching me how to make matsa balls I'm a Jew we eat those every year in passover
CHICKEN. NOODLE. SOUP. AND. BEANS. MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM. DELICIOSO
‘Yucky wucky’
Some of my family recipes include: spätzle noodles (wonderful german dish and one of my favorites) pizza bread (okay- it sounds gross but it’s pizza dough cooked ofc with oregano on top, different then the wonderful French dish) the first one is on google, and I would definitely recommend :)))
lol i learned to cook at 11
This would be the perfact hello freast sponser

When I was watching this part I was like Green bean casserole isn’t normal? 3:48
Now I want matzo ball soup ...

" I have a band aid, I know how to hold a knife now.."  *casually drops knife facing down *
As a fellow southerner, green bean casserole is amazing
If you need a kitchen item suggestion, I suggest you use Pampered Chef. Their kitchen items are unique, and my mom uses them all the time! They have from containers to cutting boards, I'm pretty sure they have knives too. They have some great tools you'd use for stirring up soup or picking up hot food like hot dogs or something.
I learned how to cook when I was 4 and now I’m 16
I SWEAR, I NEED A SOUP TIME ALBUM Edit:                                                                        Soup time~ soup time~gonna get a pot for some soup crime~soup time soup time veggies in my hand looking MIGHTY FINE~SOUP TIME SOUP TIME GONNA PEEL THE POTATOS-

“EEEWWWW GREEN BEANS..? IN CASSEROLE???? YuUcKyY wUuCkY!” 😂😂😂
Once when I was like 11 I was making pancakes sand I added 1 CUP of oil instead of 1 tablespoon of oil  The pancakes were basically deep fried 🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️
make *SOUP TIME SONG  PLEASE*
*nom nom nom* huh kinda taste like TAXES🤢
As a Jewish person I have to say that making matzoh ball soup out of a box is a crime
I like sunny side up eggs and their hard to make, I like to try.
In Soviet Russia you don’t peel potato.potato peels you
I love the soup too in Germany it’s called Grießnockerl Suppe and it’s my favorite when I’m sick
Cat😁
5:27 kirby in a nutshell
She sings liek a freakinn professional
Me and my best friends are hanging out and discussing some chaos and I said: who’s here for the chaos jokingly, not thinking they’d understand…. They understood. Peak friendship
Green bean casserole is delicious
Out of my family, I’m probably the one who loves to cook the most. Out of the many things I make here is a list of a few things I have sort of mastered making   - Fried Chicken (number one thing I love to make)  - French Fries (all different kinds as well)  - Rice (both white and yellow)  - Steak (Filet Mignon is my preferred cut)  - Grilled Chicken  - Buttermilk Biscuits (like the kind Fried Chicken places serve) - Bacon (all kinds, specially seasoned to my standards)  - Hamburgers, to which I learned that preparing them like how I prepare steak is the best way.  - Orange Chicken, with a special sauce I get from my local Wegman’s
Ooh soup I'm gonna go get my pot for some soup and crime
As a Italy person please take off the meat ball OFF the Spaghetti.  Use a Ragù,salsa,tonno or even butter. But no Meat ball.  (Just a suggestion i love you're video)
I'm 10 years old and I can make simple dishes like grilled cheese,pancakes  but the dish i can make almost without help is spaghetti i also have great taste but I like reme the rat except I taste not smell.but  I'm still learning how to make spaghetti🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙃
*Uchiha Tears* Literally the entire Uchiha clan in heaven and on Earth: When did they get my tears, put it on a board and stocked them up on shelves?

SOUP CRIME
“Anyone can cook” Raiden Ei: Am I a joke to you?
I actuely thought myself how to cook and currently I'm working as a volunteer in.... let's call it a soup kitchen even though the kwalitie of food is way higher and it's not compleetly free. A restaurant for people of all incomes. Sow I'm pretty good cook.
I love green beans they're the best :D
Oh like a month ago I cut my finger with a potato cutters too😂😂😂
I’m abt to cry- I thought that the title said “learning how to cook an adult” 😃
I laughed so hard when you said "baking gloves", I honestly don't know why it's so funny to me 🤣  (P.s: I really like your channel 🙃)

One time a girl in my class was peeling a potato and she itched her nose while holding it and cut it lol
Remember! We can’t learn if we dont make mistakes! Always try again because When you keep on trying you get better everytime!
I was once shocked 😲 by my friend cuz I was at her house and she made toast don't sound so bad right? well me and her we were about 6 and get she made toast! without her parents help they where still asleep but not gonna lie it was good 👍
Did your mom ever make BORCLY CASRL
Kinda ironic I'm a excellent cook was taught from Japan Ireland and Italy chefs and just last night I almost cut 3 of 5 fingers off cutting Roast Beef but hey teach my the curry recipe that looked amazing
Tip: if you want 2 know if ur store has the almighty Matzo Ball Soup, then (this is common sense) Check the stores, website and see if they have it. Duh
One time I was making box mix brownies, and I was reading the oil measurements, and I thought it said 1 and 1/3 cup of oil, when it actually was 1/3 cup of oil, and I was making two boxes of brownies so I added 2 and 2/3 cups of oil. And when I took the brownies out of the oven, they were drenched in oil. Lesson learned: triple check your measurements.
peppa🤭what😷are🏴‍☠you🤟doing🐬in🙂my🥺soup🙄
My mom raised me on cooking Puerto Rican food , my boyfriend doesn’t like rice, beans, or any of the seasonings I tend to use so now I only cook that when I’m alone or when I go home to visit. Otherwise I’m always trying random recipes, I’ve tried all the meal kit boxes but the only meat that was worth getting was chicken, pork, or ground beef, steaks and nice seafood was not good. Plus I got tired of all the meals not being that good. So it’s all up to me now, I must feed my man 😂
I have never felt so personally attacked from a video...especially with the Chipotle door dash LOL
How do u know what taxes tast like!?
Yeah it’s disgusting
Yo I peeled my thumb on accident while trying to peel a potato   Would not suggest
I am terrible at cooking. But my favorite thing to cook and my family loves to eat is my fried rice 😂
Number #4–don’t put your finger in a immersion blender.
Okay maybe my taste is just ruined because of my nationality because...that didn't sound like a lot of pepper...but we also use other spices like crazy so... and no I'm not asian...although spicy food does hit different
...

Me watching this as someone who learned how to cook at ten: "yes tis relatable U~U"
Bee.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Cat.
I put 3 tablespoons of salt into a small cup of tea   I almost spilled it

I am always asking myself the question WHY i always watch these kinds of videos when i am hungry
Not to flex but I was not having any trouble in turning on the stove, no fears no tears just me thinking is I could burn a house :)
I'm 12 and I know how to cook pasta perfectly, because my Italian aunt actually liked it (and not because I'm 12)
I'm eating green bean casroll right now
Peppa! What are you doing in my souuup?  -Illy 2020
My sister made the same potato peeler, just with more Blood and a worse cut
Matzoh ball soup hack that has been passed down in my Jewish family for generations: CARMELIZED ONIONS IN THE MATZOH BALLS. TAKE A SMALL HANDFUL OF MATZOH MEAL, MAKE A SMALL HOLE WITH YOUR FINGER, PUT SOME ONION IN THERE, TAKE MORE MATZOH MEAL AND COVER IT UP. It gets a bit messy but I swear it makes them taste so much better.
“Luigi if you know what’s good for you don’t come in here “  had me rolling😂
Rat Illy: ItS a iT's a sOUP!
i havent even watched the whole video but i wheezed when he cut her hand off and was like "well, since im a cartoon i can grow a hand back but HUMANS CANT
Tehe not me almost putting half a cup of cinnomin in my blueberry muffins ehhe ehhe ehhe
“Eww green beans, a casserole? Yucky wucky no thank you.” Just made me fall out of my chair 🤣
Green beans are ok but not in casseroles
Long story short, the reason why I'm here is because my dad is dealing with maggots and I was given the task of cutting the veggies
As a Hungarian kid who's mother was brought up by a food loving old fashioned family (who knew how to cook good and big amounts) I was spoiled with food by mum through my childhood. She would cook a whole list of food in monstrous amounts on every holiday.. She would cook for days, I would help her, and she taught me how to work in the kitchen when I was 5. I was baking muffins basically by myself since she just shouted into the kitchen from next room what ingredient to put into the muffin dough. Mixing? Amount measuring? Check. Now I'm so used to all of this that I cook every food for myself into school, and if I want a specific food but don't want to pay for it, than I can spend hours in the kitchen to make it, only to eat it in 10 of 5 minutes. I won't shame anyone on not knowing how to cook, but as someone who just has the instinct for it like my female family members, I just can't for the love of god understand others in this if they can't make a hamburger or soop. 😅 To me, it's just... Sounds scary, to be honest. To be a grown up, and not knowing how to handle myself in the kitchen. I really am glad, that I can do this well now. Not godly well, but well enough  for a good taste.
I know this is like a year later but WE JUST DID A GREEN BEAN CASSEROLE FOR THANKSGIVING- ITS SO GOOD!!!
yUckY wUckY

One day I was making cookie bars, And everything was doing okay. I had a friend (Who was good at cooking) with me to help. My friend goes away for a minute or two, and I read the instructions, grabbed a teaspoon, and added some coco powder (Dont remember if it was cocoa, but it was some sort of chocolate powder.)  It looked ok, I felt proud. I read the instructions correctly.. right..? I’m not a good chef, that’s one of the reasons why I got my friend to help. So when the cookies were done. Out came a COMPLETELY BROWN BAR. My friend stared at me. And then I realized my mistake. While a tablespoon holds about 15ml, a teaspoon holds 5ml. Therefore, a tablespoon is actually equal to three teaspoons. This is the main difference between tablespoon and teaspoon. I added a TABLESPOON of chocolate powder. Not realizing. So when we were done, we ended up having fudge bars.

✨ Soup Time✨
My biggest flex is I started cooking when I was 10. Obviously my mom helped me but by the time my big 11 rolled around I could cook many things all by myself!
I just remembered this video when I was cooking today... Specially the pepper accident... You see, I have a small container of minced cayenne pepper and someone had unscrewed the top so, when I went to add some spice to my spaghetti a ton of cayenne fell on my food...  And like heck I'm going to throw a platter of food...   I swear that midway on my meal I could feel my old Charmander plushie that I've had since childhood (named Rena after my original in game Charmander, but I digress) look at me with pity in its eyes...   But by the love of everything holy and unholy I finished the darn thing...   Now I need to figure out who was the culprit so I can add some garnish to their next meal...
Your character is so cool and your story's are soo interesting keep going
Wow! You did an amazing job on this animation!

green bean casserole is greatttt
I am NOT lying when I say I BINGE your channel! It’s soooo good!! 😁❤️✨
Ah. This makes me thankful my family taught me how to cook basic foods.   And thanksgiving food.  Mostly the thanksgiving food.
Bro guys casseroles sound nasty, but I swear. When cooked amd baked right, it is so good. (My uncle has a rlly good broccoli cheddar green bean casserole secret recipe.)
ANY INGREDIENT ANY FLAVOR ANY SPICE     ✨PAPA JHONS✨ wait no-
Hi
Not illy dropping the knife on her foot
I added pain to my matzaball soup and it tastes like ✨CoLaRs✨
My mom always makes matzo ball soup every Passover. I have so many memories with it and it’s definitely a comfort food
Matza ball soup is traditionally Jewish, are you Jewish?
I like cooking, but I find it difficult to cook when I have a fear of getting burned by exploding (I'm just describing what it was like, it doesnt exactly explode) boiling oil. It started when I was a beginner trying to make/cook scrambled eggs and hotdogs for breakfast, the heat was just right, but for some reason the oil started sparking or something and went to my leg. It made a scar on my left leg, it hurt so bad I had to rush to the bathroom and watch the skin peel off. And ever since then, when the oil does it again, I stay 1-2 meters away from the pan or just dodge/face my back to the electrical stove. But that's not the only fear I have while cooking, it's the 'fear of burning down the house' one.  My fear slowly subsided when I made garlic fried rice, still kinda scary though.    (Just wanted to share my 'lil' experience)
On the topic of hurting yourself in the kitchen, this one time I almost cut my finger off with a knife.      That was a good day.
“Ew green beans in casserole?!” “YuKy wUkY!”
i love green bean casserole

Peppa What are you doing in my soup?
How you use a spoon- when your child disrespects you hit them with the spoon
One time I cook the furby I don't know why I added a teaspoon of water instead of salt the furby caught on fire
Add a bayleaf                 Or maybe 2 😂

It wasn't till I went to my first serious girlfriend's house for Thanksgiving that I found out red cabbage was something special my family did because we have German ancestry. I just thought it was something everyone had.
Maztoball soup is basically agodingas (I think i thats how you spell it)
When my mom makes green bean casserole feels like it’s melting in mouth it’s delicious

Me being afraid of toast popping out of the toaster:
When the tablespoon morphed into teaspoon, I literally died
Hi 👋😁

My favorite stew: -brown gravy -green beans -carrots -peas -potatoes
I’m terrified of the flames 😅 Then I burned myself after an involuntary muscle spasm so now I’m only able to use those flat, touch screen stoves.  Usually I can feel those muscle spasms and twitches coming but that one snuck up on me
Always double check tbsp and tsp!
With the peeler I peeled my thumb and now I got a scar for the last 4 years
Hi there
It was funny and you said to Luigi is not good to go in to the bathroom  😂 lol
My friends have a inside joke, one time we were making cupcakes and they thought it was 1/4 CUPS of baking powder when on the recipe it was 1/4 TEASPOONS. They were all sunken in and sad but we always laugh about it 🧁

Ok , now I have a terrific craving for Matzo ball soup and I have never even tried it before ! Looks like I will either have to cook it up or find a Jewish deli !

I’m so terrible at cooking. The only thing I can cook without a microwave is eggs and grilled cheese and ramen
Dude my friend who is 10 can cook better than my mom
POV: an 11 year old kid can cook better then and actual ADULT

I did that exact same mixup with pepper in pork buns lol XD
3:26 hahahahaa the aeroplane has a butt!! why?! haha
I'm actually not half bad at baking, but I often don't look too closely and mess up. Once, I made gingerbread cookies and accidentally added cumin rather than cinnamon because my braid saw "c" and thought it must be right. I had to add so much cinnamon, ginger, and nutmeg to cover the flavor
Some people be like 👍
Green been casserole is delicious  😋
Ur cat suit is giving cats the musical

The knife PSA reminded of the time my cousin helped with dinner. I was at my cousin's house playing GTA V or something while he was peeling the potatoes. my cousin was the type who pretended to get hurt a lot, so he was peeling potatoes and....he cut himself. He yelled in pain and told us that he cut himself, and everyone else was like- "Shut up yo didn't do anything", but that time he actually did. So we wrapped a bandage around his hand and drove over to Wisconsin Dells, and then he almost drowned in the wave pool. So moral of the story is: Don't cry wolf to much or else you'll cut your hand while making dinner.
I like how that guy acts like Jeffy after hearing about the green beans 3:40-3:46
Chile-Cheddar-Bacon Matzo-Ball-Soup, with ham and leek.
Shit-Man! Green-bean-casserole? Those words are bookends to another dimension where your parents almost didn't meet but congratulations, your green-been-casserole quantum-leaps and saves your time-line: mushroom-hunt and gather edibles, with goat-creme, garden-herbs, and tallow-blistered-onions, top with singed parsley, or your parents will never have met!
Matzo ball soul sounds like my grandmother's dumplings but I always asked for my ones to be mushed together to be gigantic
why did you make the thing look like a taco they dont look like that they are fully rapped around like a cilinder
Why do I sing along to the “soup time” song lol
Does anybody else just love the fact that Jujutsu Kaisen characters are often in her videos backgrounds or is it just me
This video reminded me of a time where my mom cut her finger almost clean off while cutting something in the kitchen. When she got to the hospital the nurse said that she's lucky the knife was so sharp, and that she wouldn't need stitches because the cut was so clean. She just has a bandage for a few weeks and it was fine. BTW just wanted to say that I love your videos Illy! By far my favorite Youtube animator.
One time I burnt a cake in a microwave....
Lol when I was like 7 I was making Mac & cheese with my dad and I was on the counter holding the cheese packet next to the stove and my dad was outside I thought I he said to put it in so I did but I did it to fast and the hot boiling water splashed right on the thigh 🥲traumatized but I’m okay
As someone who has fooled around with sharp objects..... (A whittle while go I was whittling and cut off half my thumb nail with half the thumb tip down to the bone. And don't get me started with other objects...) (☞ ಠ_ಠ)☞ Safety with knives is important. If you are lucky, a small cut. If you ain't, good bye finger.
Im from the south (NC to be exact) and have never had Mazzball soup. It sounds pretty good. I also have made the mistake of using to much of an ingredient. I converted salt wrong because I couldnt find the right measuring size from the recipe I was using. It was so salty everyone who try it, had to spit it out.
Thay teach this in school now lol
I have cutting vegetables since I was 7
Not knowing how to cook even one meal is wilddddd
Only ogs know what the original thumbnail was
I remember one time I mixed up the salt and sugar in a cake 😀 Bonus points because I couldn’t test the batter due to my raw egg allergy so I didn’t notice until it was fully baked. *that was a fun day.*
aaaaahh peppa pig I'm scared of the backstory aaaaahhh
Everybody else: *gets inspiration of meals* Me: *TODOROKI ON THE FRIDGEE*

Can someone please explain the peppa pig joke cause I'm confused lol
Instructions unclear, thought my hand would regrow when I cut it off. Didn't. How do I do it again?
Mmm green geans
As soon as I heard matzo ball soup, I got flashbacks to hotel transylvania 2  (Also, I dont know if I spelled matzo right)

Green bean casserole is good!
Who doesn’t like green bean casserole it is the best I’m from North Carolina too
Have you ever tried Korean corn dogs? They're like American corn dogs but with mozzarella and panko bread crumbs. They're pretty good.
I started cooking at age 10 this makes me feel smart
i dont do green bean. i do tater tots. i dont act like....maaz.....hahahaha
One time I was baking I added way too much water and I had no more dough, so I added cornbread mixture, and let me tell you it was delicious. So just keep trying and watch out for those dull knives. 😅😂
OMG I LOVE GREEN BEAN CASSEROLE, I LIVE IN SC AND LOOOOOOVVEEEEEE IT!
Wish in real life people could grow their body parts back 😓
For me I know how to use and cook with those utensils you call things. I learnt how to use them when I was 10 years old
Lol I'm 10 and can already cook I started cooking at 6 or 7 years old
At 6:56 I saw it coming
I don’t know how to cook, but I want to learn.
POV- your name is actually remy just spelt with a I. couldn’t be me🤭🤭
i was making cookies and i added a table spoon of salt not teaspoon so they were salty cookies LOL
she yells at the man for  making the matzah balls to big jewsh mother vibe
When you add too much of one flavoring, you can always get another ingredient to tone down a that flavoring. For example if you add too much pepper, you can always add a little bit of sugar to tone the spice down. Since you added 1/2 of a teaspoon to much pepper, you can add 1/2 a teaspoon of sugar.
I grew up in the South too and I didn't like green bean casserole but I also don't like macaroni so what am I doing??? 🤢🤢🤢
Me relating so hard to them green bean casserole leaving in da south
Can i add any Meat in the soup?
Pov: ur therepest is an animation >:)
I would recommend making homemade pizza. It's one of my favorite things to make, and it's surprisingly easy! And if you don't want to buy a pizza stone/steel, there are plenty of other ways to make it.
I am a child and I can cook because my parents
Once i was eating that soup, and i couldnt move, talk or do.. Anything ecept throw up allover myself 😃
I learned to bake a cake at 7 and learned to make much more at 9 and I’m 11😀 i also am afraid of making chopped potatoes… I feel like ima burn em
I learned how to cook when I was 10
My parents were adamant that I would learn how to cook so I would not be one of those children they get a call from asking stuff like "how do I boil potatoes"
omg i have a story that is the same with the pepper. i read the recipe as a cup of salt... it was a pinch.  in my defence my glasses were broken XD
Once you’ve played as many violent gorey games I played then you find that blood and other “gross” things are not that gross
Lol you videos are always so funny I was dying when you said Luigi if you know what's good for you don't come in here 😂😂
Honestly green bean casserole is one of my favorites!!! And I did grow up in NC I promise!!!!
Not me watching this while over cheesing my macoroni and then deciding im always gonna do it
Illy: MATZOBALL SOUP!  All Jews: YASSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
Currently watching this with gauze on my hand because I cut it again somehow. Everytime i cook I either burn or cut myself by accident... at least I learned how to feed myself
I’m happy that im 11 and I know how to cook and bake
I never tried matzoball soup but I have tried chicken soup I hope one day I'll get a taste of it!
Brown sugar, milk tea step one, boil one cup water and add 2 or 3, depending on how strong you want it begs of black tea, let it steep for about 10 minutes. then step 2, you add in 2 tablespoons for one cup of brown sugar. And then you mix up that concoction and put it in the fridge. Then, after like an hour, maybe if you're rushing it half an hour, but don't trust me, it's better for an hour, and then you pour half of that concoction into a cup, and then you top it off with milk, give it a little stir and it's delicious.
As someone who’s both of there parents are from the south they force me to eat it all the time
Peppa what are you doing in my soupp
If you are a poor student with a spinach can (like Popey the mtherfcker), put just a bit of milk with your spinach (1/2 tablespoon) during cooking. It'll make them smoother, more onctuous.
My mom taught me how to make mac n cheese when I was 8 or something and im scared to move out amd have to either order everything for dinner or only have Mac n Cheese This is what I imagine  “Im hungry and I made dinner last night ao can you make some tonight?”  “Yeah sure” “Ok can I have some soup” “Sorry no I will make something else” “Uhm ok?” *finished making dinner “Uhm.. mac n cheese?” “HECK YE” “ok then..”  Ok that sounded way worse in my head 😂

(Do not respond) Once I made cupcakes and I was reading the recipe off line and I did not get a lot of sleep the night before it said 1 1/2 teaspoons of salt my brain read 11 1/2 teaspoons of salt the looked like biscuits and tasted like when you miss a spot mixing but instead it’s in the HOLE cupcake
I love to cook, but I still have alot to learn. Other than that its really FUN!!!
I am 12 and i love to cook but Hate the stove

Well my mom buy this and I am a kid I am still a kid a 8 year old
As an Asian, I always measure by my eyes, and sometimes it makes my food terrible, like you adding too much salt.
Reminds me of the time my mum let me put the pepper in the cheese sauce for the Mac and cheese it was meant to be like two pinch’s but I um added a bit too much but pepper on mashed potatoes is so good Edit: she never lets me put pepper in unless I cook it myself
I wanna try that soup now 🙃
I swear their is nothing better than goodly cooked green bean casarole
Hear me out..beans in the soup
I'm trying out HelloFresh, first go tonight didn't go as thought but it turned out pretty good with what didn't get burnt in the pan

I’m also afraid of Turning on the stove ! I am afraid of fire.
Male pizza is ez
0:12 omg her ahh is so adorable
The only things I know how to cook are homemade lunchable-style pizza (just stack 2 tortillas put some pizza sauce and cheese on em and toss on some leftover chicken from gumbo and stick it in the microwave and put some seasoning on), instant ramen, and premade microwave meals. edit: and semi-sweet cornbread
My brother dropet a 🔪 on his foot

I grew up on Matzo Ball Soup, and when I tell you it’s BUSSIN’
One time I was making sugar cookies   I made the recipe all wrong and they ended up burnt and hard then I went back and made chocolate chip cookies and it made me not sad

🍰🍰🍰🍰🍰🍰🍰🍰🍰
I think I’m more prepared I learn how to cook at 8
yUcKeY WuCkEy
I got a basic recipe that's not to hard I call lazy lasagna.  brown 1 pound of burger while you preheat the over to 350.  in a cake pan thing, you know that glass thing, mix the burger (after draining) with a box/bag of noodles (not spaghetti or lasagna is my suggestion anything else so far seems fine) with a jar of pasta sauce and fill the jar with water and mix that all in to.  cook for 45 minutes.  take it out and put mozzarella to taste and cook another 8 minutes and youre done.  you can tweak this with say pepperjack cheese, or add mushrooms or whatever but that's the basics of the recipe. nothing flashy, but its like lasagna without all the prep.
The first thing I ever learned to cook by myself was caned chicken broth
Am I the only one who counts the candles and is like hmmmmm 14 is an adult? 🤔 IM AN ADULT 🤪
I got lucky with this, my dad taught me growing up🤭
The Matzo Ball Soup sounds like a dish made out of being poor and using whatever is left in the kitchen… and as someone who grew up in a poor income home, my mother got crazy in the kitchen and she made some meals that are so nostalgic and so basic lol.
de first dish i made was salt XD
Peter Piper picked a pickled pepper pppppp is so satisfying to hear
Me and illy are the same person
i want to say thank you so much for inspiering me to get into animation :] you are awsome:]
Maybe try deserts because they are a lot easier and with some practice you can get really good at it and I'm 11 and can make cookies and if I can you can do it to
I love green casserole
Green bean casserole is delicious
We all have to start somewhere this video made me more motivated to try exploring in the kitchen. The apron is so cool
3:48 I'm glad I'm not the only one who grew up with Green Bean Casserole and loves it still to this day
No h help and no parent to help no one
Let me just say well don't want to rub it in or anything but I learned how to cook when I was in kindergarten and I'm going to fifth grade and I'm 10 knowing how to make a flatbread and and pizza

Is it just me or did anybody just keep listening to the soup time song
אני מת על קניידלך! טעים ממש!
I am half the age of you and I know how to cook better than you…..
5:53 ah yes *uchiha tears*
I don't find it fun when I just add wettnes to dry things, I like to know what I'm eating
what is international food ile?
My first time cooking was with my sister, before either of us went to school. we made a horrid cake and forced our father to eat it and he lied saying it was tasty... In all honesty we put too much salt in it and smashed the egg into the bowl leaving the egg shells behind. My mother ended up helping us a little by putting it in the oven after she woke up. It was shaped like a heart because we had cake moulds back then. Now I'm not bad at all in cooking, I already made cake, milk pie, soup, fried rice, and many more. I'm happy to say that I am proud of my cooking skills. See you now, bye!
the number one thing i learned when i started cooking was to skip the pepper aaaaa
יאאא קניידלעך חחחח למה היא קוראת לזה כדורי מצה

me watching this after I had cooking class at school--
I love this my fav video the best!
Motze ball soup is my life
I think it's my autism showing though I'm not sure but whatever it is I literally can't stir anything without it spilling even a little. Or I have to go super slow.
Chicken casserole isn't hard to make so try to make it
I live in Georgia so I know what you mean by in the south, green bean casserole is all the gaze, because I make it every week or so.
Breaking news: white person brings green bean casserole to the potluck 😔
yo when i was 8, i learned how to make my first FULL meal. i kept aspiring and now, i cook dinner for me, and my extended family, and family friends very often!
Peel a potato for soup!  That’s the real crime!  Keep that skin!
I took that phrase "everyone messes us there first pancake" and ran with it cause I burnt that f@#$er to a  literal crisp, it was shriveled to pure black, I kid you not it CRUMBLED. For context I left the stove on to hot and was listening to music COMPLETELY forgetting I had something on the stove LMAO
i used to not know how to make a microwave mac and cheese now i know how to mkae soup amlets sunnyside up flipped egg cake and anything in a microwave im not that old tho so ill learn more the older i get
Bruh the moment she said "Peppa what are you doing in my soup?" I heard it in the other room but different
green bean caesural is the best thing ever . I SAID .
As the child of a gourmet chef, the best way to learn on your own is simply trial and error.
I love how she was at -grocery outlet- Illy Mart :)
The first time I ever cooked something I added way too much cumin to the guacamole. My mom said it tastes fine, but deep down I know she was just lying to make me feel better about myself-
Green bean casserole is the BEST INVENTION EVER! That's one of the sides I can't wait to eat when it's Thanksgiving
L
No
I prefer electric ranges to gas. So much safer and easier to use.
Mazza ball soup I Jewish
That doesn't seem like to much pepper tbh
Oh my god. Today totally randomly I had "the bee's knees" in my head and I COULD NOT remember from where I got it. NOW I know where I got it from :D The luck that I'm rewatching this video now.
Me hearing Matzoh Ball soup made me scream! I love this stuff! Growing up in a Jewish house and my family being Jewish during Passover we would make Matzoh Ball soup! It is the BEST! I guess you are Jewish too!  My grandma wasn't Jewish but she still made the best soup ever! :) Everyone Jewish or not needs to try it! @illymation !
Dang, it's 11:00 and now  I'm hungry how dare you
OMG Hamination rite something here
(Blinks in disbelief) A Tater Peeler - I can peel potatoes with a knife no problem and you can't peel potatoes when the thing you virtually have to put it against has a physical thing that you can stare at and know which side you're supposed to use against the potato! I just... you know what... I cut myself with a cheese grater when I was young fine: I'll let you have this one... BUT A POTATO PEELER! (throws arms up in air) I at least cut myself out of enthusiasm for grated cheese! What are you... don't draw my fingers getting grated that's nightmare fuel huaaaah!
I like ur apron haha
green bean casserole is the BEST
U are my comfort youtuber <3
6:19 that's adorable 😊. Oh peppa
6:18 that's adorable 😊. Oh peppa
One thing that's wrong is  Yes the handling of the knife she uses is the most common for people who start out cooking. But when you start using knifes more and more you can change how you cut.
10:43 The "connie" in the back. Absolutely delicious
The pepper overload is something I've experienced in college. My friends and I where making beef and noodles. My friend wanted pepper in it. So he put some in. Tasted, then some more, and more... it was settling out to the bottom, and he didn't stir before tasting. In the end, it was pretty hot. Had to double the rest of the ingredients, plus double up the mash potatoes. Not scoop the bottom, and still was way peppery.
I feel like matza ball soup is an excellent clear soup, but my favorite will always be the creamy soups. like chicken and dumplings (good dumplings will be similar in texture to matza balls).  I feel like if you have a good few bases, cooking gets a lot easier.  my two go-tos are cottage pie and Mac and cheese. homemade cheese sauce is easy to make and tastes better than powdered in my opinion.
Ah yes, one of the most important cooking accessories, baking gloves.
And that's wht I choose a latina
Soup and roast vegetables are the absolute best easy kitchen things to make
I'm Jewish. I have eaten MANY a box matzo ball in from scratch chicken soup. I have nothing bad to say about box matzo balls. They're budget friendly. They're easy. They're quick. And they're satisfying as heck. But when I met my husband's parents, they made my first ever from scratch matzo balls. And..... WOW. They're amazing! Like out of this world amazing. My husband's father spent like 5 years perfecting his recipe. It takes longer and requires executive functioning to plan ahead and let the ingredients chill out overnight instead of just half an hour, it's significantly more expensive, and ditching vegetable oil in favor of duck fat won't give anyone's cardiologist joy, but the result is be most delicious matzo balls I've ever experienced.
IZAZAZAZA SOUP
I can live off boba when I got to college

Still terrified of the oven, but I made waffles for the fam, and they were very good!  Also made toasted bagles.  bagels.
Peelers scare me...
When I Guy said green bean casserole taste bad,I was like WHAT DID YOU SAY. I love green bean casserole
Dang it illymaton I watch this when I was stoned and now I just wanna eat everything you shared in this video especially the soup
Now I’m wondering if Americans does not have cooking class in school.
Ok so wow im in high school lol but yeah i can cook
It is my favorite food in the world!!!!!
I have a recipe for you Illy! It's CHEAP and yummy.......and there's not actual measurements....... Enough russet potatoes (skin or no skin is up to you) to cover the bottom of your pot Half a green cabbage Enough yellow onion for a layer over the taters Salt to taste Tumeric enough to make it green (tumeric turns green when paired with a fat) Butter a WHOLE STICK  So boil the potatoes and when they're soft toss some chopped onions and half the chopped cabbage until that goes soft Next toss in AN ENTIRE STICK OF BUTTER then sprinkle in tumeric until it's highlighter green then salt and pepper to taste ENJOY!
I’m a child and I can already make a cake by myself :)
I was vining to soup time song
*peppa* Peppa what r u doing in the comment section
Why do I see a bunch of people that I watch?
When she first said "Matzo Ball Soup" I was thinking about Hotel Transelvainia 2, because when Mavis is pregs she gets MATZO/ MONSTER BALL SOUP her mom's recipe. (Me saying "her mom's recipe" has nothing do do with what I am saying, its just in the movie.)
grace field meat 🤧😀
Is it in Aruba
"Tastes like taxes" And this is why I never want to move in America, you spend like 2/3 of your money on taxes
Me at 9 making pizza rolls: I am 2 universes ahead of you
I too grew up with greenbean casserole. We use cream of bacon instead of mushroom and it comes out so good. Try it sometime n.n
One time I was helping my mom peel and cut potatoes for shepherd's pie when I was a teenager. I wasn't paying attention and I sliced into my right thumb. I treated my wound and proceeded to successfully cut my other thumb as I was continuing to help. My mom took over before I could "kill myself" and let me go play video games instead.
I wound up taking a culinary class in High school just to avoid any cooking mistakes. Turns out I'm a pretty decent cook, and when I have the chance, it's fun!
When i was 9 i literally started cooking like noodles in a frickin metal bowl
Aww man I can only make scrambled eggs, bacon and pancakes. :(
Maaz: no eyes Illy: soon to be no fingers
4:05 Those are all things I hate yay .-.
Once when I was like 7 years old, I put easy mac in the microwave without putting water with it so yeah, I almost burned down the house 😁😅😐
3:39 Yeah, you manage to turn something delicious into something disgusting, Given the context
Love Your videos but how the hell do you mess up tacos? You put the shells in the oven, the meat on the pan and cut everything else up. Not sure how you mess that up
The go to dish for me is just pasta bolanase since it’s just pasta passata beef and the tomato sauce thing
"Kinda tastes like taxes" more like depression
we need a soup time ful oversight NOWWWW
Ok first of all GREEN BEAN CASSEROLE IS DELICIOUS WHOSE SAYING OTHERWISE FIGHT ME BISH

I remember when I was making chocolate chip cookies I accidentally misread the labels and added lemon extra instead of vanilla extract. The cookies were still good just salty😭

When I was a kid I literally went to three different schools. One was my actual school. The second one was the school named 'my father'. He literally trained me as a handyman and a farmer. He taught me everything from carpentry to taking care of a farm and even shooting. Then there was my mom. I think she felt bad about the heavy training of my father and didn't want to be left out so she did the same thing. She taught me everything ranging from knitting to cooking and I these education started even before I formally started school. Shortly it was basically a torture but now I'm kinda happy about it? I'm practically indestructible. You could put me on a deserted place and I could survive just fine. I know how to hunt and if the flora is not too unfamiliar I'm sure that I can find many edible plants. My mother taught me about it too. Dang it! I never got to be a kid!!! Every one around me was a God damn tutor on some thing!!! 😭😭😭😭😭😭
This is literally my comfort video- idk how to explain it but uhm .. ye
I’m pretty good in the kitchen myself, but there is one thing getting in the way of me being at least a decent chef: me. Specifically my anxiety. I can’t do too many things at once, so if I am in the middle of step 3C and the timer goes of for step 3A and step 3B is still in progress, I slowly start to panic and my anxiety goes into *MAXIMUM OVERDRIVE* and all that goes through my head as I try to not burn down the kitchen is “Don’t die don’t die don’t die” on loop until I can calm myself down with music or if I finish, whichever comes first.
I love all the Ratatouille references!
How about when you first cooked eggs
“LiKe A cLaW…….LiKe A cAt……HiSsSsSsSsS”  -Ilyssa
I LOVE matzo ball soup too!!
OMG I love matzo balls
The floating peppa is iconic
Cant make mozball soup 😭😭😭😭   Is it legal if we import mozball soup to ukraine because of trading blockades
I don't get that people think that green beans are the MoSt HoRrIbLe thing in the world.
Yeah I hurt myself too with the peeler it was bleeding
I'm younger then you and i can cook.
"Don't make the **BALLS TOO BIG!**
I can use a peeler normaly without getting cut and i never got cut by a peeler
One time I was making some eggs for breakfast. And it was time for me to add the salt and pepper. That day the pepper wasn't coming out so I shook it hard and then a lot came out. (not really a lot but too much.) So i added a lot of salt because i thought it would taste better. But when I took a bite it didn't taste well.
another thing good about sharp knifes!: people say cutting onions will make your eyes water or burn but sharp knifes can kinda prevent that
I remember I was going to make an omelet, but, I messed it up, so; I wound up with scrambled eggs with cheese.
I didnt grow up in the south but DAMN green bean casseroles hit diffrent
Love how at 5:53 on the sign in says Uchiha tears
i love green bean casserole
Every friday at my previous workplace I’d go down to the cafe and the lady who ran it gave me a bowl her Matzo Ball Soup. It is the best Motzo Ball Soup I will ever have in my life.
funny
Matzoh Ball Soup is the best. I like to say it’s Jewish Soul Food. 😊
My mom is helping me learn how to cook. She taught how to make Alfredo sauce
I love maztabol soop
1:10 why does no one speak about how good she sings?
Ahh! Yes the feels!!!!! "You're an adult now!" Says my work Boss (me 16) me:"Aaaaaarrrrrrrrrrrrrgggggghhhhhhh!!!!!!!" Someone did a survey for what an adult should be able to do.... There was paying taxes, getting into a house, getting a loan..... All sorts of things... The fact that the world doesn't get destroyed if you come across something you can't do is very tragic 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
WHY DID THE CARTOON HAND FALLING OFF MAKE ME GASP AS IF IT WAS REAL???

Please put ‘Soup time’ on spotify
My mom makes matzaballsoup except my fam called then dumplings and puts them in stew instead of soup she also makes them from scratch with flour and who knows what im not a chef
Anyone can cook, except raiden
Like Luigi
Since everyone's posting recipes here I'd like to introduce something I figured out how to make a while back: Wonton soup with udon noodles. All it takes is udon noodles, an entire carton of chicken broth, paprika, garlic salt, and frozen mini wontons. What you wanna do is cook the udon noodles first, rinse them when they're done, and put them in your bowl while you make everything else. You dump the carton of chicken broth in the pot and add paprika and garlic salt. How much paprika and garlic salt? I dunno, however much feels right. You heat it on high heat until it's boiling, lower the heat to medium, and then put in a whole bunch of frozen mini wontons, cover the pot, and let it cook for another two minutes. Once it's done, you ladle however much of the soup and wontons you want into the bowl with the noodles. It's cheap, easy, and it slaps. It's also customizable.
My dad lost 2 fingers maar n te kitchen
I tried cooking at 9, F TO THE ING 9 YEARS OLD, I know how to cook 7 types if food now. I am still on my to be a teen, I AM NOT YET A FRICKING TEEN BUT KNOWS HOW TO COOK 7 MEALS, 7!

I’m a Chinese person so my moon cooks thing really good
I didn’t say that
i know and im ## years
Well if you want a tasty meal you either have to pay for it or learn to make it yourself, that is why I learned to cook. My family also has a especial recipe, but the dish is called carnitas (little meats), its pork cooked in the pig's own fat, I hate that dish so I never learned the family recipe, I don't think that I could make it even if I knew it. The pot just fills your nose with the smell of boiling fat, if you are not careful, it will also fill your clothes.
5:50 is no one going to talk about how the grace field meat from promise neverland
I started cooking when I was 7 by cooking I mean microwaving boritos

GREEN BEAN CASSEROLE? THE BEST FOOD IN THE WORLD? HECK YEAH!
a silver potato peeler actually scared my hand
I'm gonna make this soup ^^ and check out this apron busniess (Amazing video and i love you and been here for awhile!)
The sharp objects thing, I felt that.
Preheat Oven to 450 degrees Fahrenheit (232 degrees Celsius)  Prepare Chicken Thighs or Chicken Legs, or combination thereof. Removing as much surface moisture from chicken, will result in crispier skin. The following recipe does 8 pieces.  Mix together the following spices and seasonings: 2 Teaspoon Onion Powder 2 Teaspoon Garlic Powder 1-1/2 Teaspoon Paprika 1 Teaspoon Thyme 1 Teaspoon Oregano 1 Teaspoon Salt 1/2 Teaspoon black pepper powder  2 Tablespoon olive oil (This is a good starting amount. If you feel more is needed, don't hesitate to add a bit more, 1/2 Tablespoon at a time).  In a bowl coat the chicken with olive oil. You may do it one piece of chicken at a time, or all at once. Be sure to get it under the skin as well. Once coated in olive oil, to your liking, apply Seasoning/spice mix to each piece of chicken, be sure to get it under the skin.  Place coated chicken on a cooking rack, that's on a baking sheet. Bake in oven for 30-40 minutes. Pull out of oven, and let it cool. Then dig in.  If you do not use a cooking rack, and instead place the chicken directly on the baking sheet, you will have to flip the chicken after 15-20 minutes.   Feel free to experiment with spices and seasonings. Example: I once did 3/4 Teaspoon Paprika, and 3/4 Teaspoon Chili Powder; made for spicier chicken.
6:42,  it really felt like an ad for something like, SOUP

I'm currently re-re-watching this during passover (a jewish holiday) and man im cravin some motzah ball soup.
THANK THE EVER LOVING GODS I WASNT THE ONLY ONE WHO HAD TO DEAL WITH GREEN BEAN CASSEROLE
She called boba milk tea
People think that green bean casserole is gross? Didn't know that. My job literally has a thanksgiving meal every month (don't ask me why, idk why) and they have that included in with the meal. I've had it once when my sister made it. I think it's okay, but that's only because i didn't like the onions lol
chipotle is homophobic. that's why i don't go.
At 5:54 i wish I could sniff things, I have horrible smell snd can't breath a lot soooooo 😢
Wow I'm really young and I know how to cook
I’m ten and I often use the stove
Umm... hey illymation I just wanted to say just wach wolfychus vidos by her self becaues THAY ARE REALLY SUS!!!!!
the frase "anyone can cook" does not mean litterally anyone can cook. it means a good cook can come from anywhere.
wait, not everyone has their mom teach them how to cook ramen at 13? not even popcorn?
Whys it called a Ted talk?
Soup time was literally stuck in my head today lol.
1:32 I did something similar. Except it wasn't the same one, it was more knife like (not looking like a razor) but stabbed my knuckle because the sharp peeler didn't wanna peel (FRESH out the box sharp)
Whats wrong with potatos?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!
@illymation your videos are entertaining
UHH I LEARNED HOW TO COOK WHEN I WAS 7

I was going to point out that matzo ball soup is only good with reasonably sized balls… my church always made it with these MONSTER balls and it was hard to eat…
Omg I’m pretty young and I still know how to use the stove and cook yummy food and use sharp tools
Me and my mom just made a fruity pebbles cake, it is currently in the oven, and i  hope it doesn't burn lol :P   Edit: It turned out SO GOOD. Ya'll have a good day!
2:14 you don't know me!!!
biggest tip take food class in high school make it very ez to switch over to cooking for yourself
Hi
The fact that I’m eating soup while watching this is… just beautifull
5:33 I eat the same (but without carrots and we don’t eat that since we moved)
Cooking is a skill that can and get better with practice, when I was 3 my mother let me use the stove, oven and knives to cook (she watched and helped me) and the things I made were horrendous but now 12 years of practice later my family thinks I should take the skill into business as it is my "calling"
I'm 8 and I'm alould  to use the stove
6:58 out of context
Are you jewish?
Me:cooks at 8 till 12
I love my mom's Green Bean Casserole. She'd make it for dinner, family gatherings, or Thanksgiving. I used to eat the leftover french fried onions~ :3

The soup looks delicious in here, never tried it or heard of it actually!
I love Matzo ball soup!
U should hace ratger bamed your cat Hitler
In school when we were in PREP, PREP! We worked in the kitchen and had to get a knife license to do it- I can’t with this school
Lol, I lost it when you were yelling about the right size to make the matzo balls.
Dam, I wish my friends were this way lol. We had a Friendsgiving this year, and I made layered rainbow jello with coolwhip on top. No one ate it because they asked how I made the middle layers, which is by splitting the jello in half and mixing a tablespoon of sour cream in it before letting it harden in the fridge. That made me kinda sad that I worked for hours to make it and no one would touch it.

This video is old but I have an important addition! Invest in a knife sharpener! I got one from Ikea and it works on any knife that has the standard, not serrated blade. Dishwashers are no problem
i first cooked as a 9 year's old
4:22 always happens to me
Oooh my brother used to work at jepotle

Thats why my mom taught me to cook when i was 9 👍
My mom and I make matzah balls bigger than your fist! The key is to add seltzer because it keeps the outside fluffy and the insides firm! A perfect texture experience
Great video you safe amazing
maamyouneed to learn how to cook.
umm.
"And if you want all the fingers you were born with-"  People who have been born without arms:   👁👄👁
okay, be real here, anyone else terrified to cook taco meat because it like pops and stuff?
*WHEEZE* ok... so I've watched this vid WAY more than once so i opened the video and it was at the part when Illy says... "Add the soup mix..." but then it just went... "Add" *ad for shoes pops up* that was awesome...
The pepper predicament reminds me of last week where I over-seasoned mash potatoes with salt. I’m now more restrained with the salt pouring.
I love green bean casrols   Typo
My sister she um she caught WATER ON FIRE LIKE HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE
I’ve been cooking a long time, even got a personal chef certificate. I have 2 words for you, Slow Cooker or Crockpot. Throw your ingredients in there 6-8 hours on low and forget about it.  Want to start getting fancier, 2 more Sous Vide. It cooks your protein perfectly and has a timer.
It takes longer to animate the mouth, you can do what you want but I would do smth like the odd ones out.
lol yucky wucky how is that person a adult
but i cook and im 11 and im not scared
I swore I was amazing at peeling potatoes and the peeler got stuck on the potato…uhm yeah it slipped off and cut a HUGE chunk out of my thumb and I could almost see the bone 🥲 there was a piece of potato in my thumb and I got it out, I swear there’s a piece of potato in my thumb that replaced the skin on that part lol
hmmm... kinda tastes like *tAxEs* This got me rolling over the floor 🤣🤣🤣😭
as a jewish kid from the 2000s, matzo ball soup was a go-to and i completely agree with ilyssa’s feelings about the soup. confirmed delicous. (except for when my brother tried to make it we don’t talk about that)
early (EARLY) morning/late night food inspiration is real. seriously like most the stuff I make is  at like four am
miso sœp
This video was also sponsored by Disney's Ratatouille
You’re tell me I can’t just grow my whole hand back! Darn
If you are born in my culture you will know how to cook and be a professional at cooking at the age of 10 well no so lucky me I was the spoiled child growing up and now I'm a 12 year old who doesnt know how to cook I know rice tomato soup and so on but I'm not a professional yet umm my sister teases me like "your gonna get married soon so learn how to cook" I was the spoiled kid becouse my mom knew how hard it was she had to learn at the age of 6 and became a professional at the age of 8 like wtf
WHY IS NO ONE  TALKING ABOUT PEPPA, SAVE HERRR
I love you👩🏻‍🦰
In my previous life, I knew how to cook some basics and was basically OK with it. I could eat out when I wanted something special. Now (after my evacuation) I'll have to learn how to cook on the solid fuel stove and it is sort of scary. Or I'll have sandwiches, instant porridge, and occasional hot meals when other people cook it till I'll have some normal stove (hope I will once).
thank go my mom taught me how to cook when I was 7
I LOVE GREEN BEAN CASSEROLE ITS LIKE MY FAVORITE WHY DOES NOBODY KNOW IT
What is milk tea ? I only know what boba is 😂
This video made me so damn hungry... and now I have the urge to just cook something.  I'm not the best, but I love cooking. Especially cooking soup. Soup is magical to me. You fill a pot with water, and just toss in whatever you want. My go-to homemade soup is carrots, potatoes, chicken, green beans, salt, and a hot sauce of my choosing (tends to change, depending on supplies and mood). Also noodles, if I have them. I used to add celery to this mix, but the celery was always stubborn and never softened all the way, and I hate raw celery, so I've since removed it from my list.  I've also learned that if you add some flour to your broth, it thickens it as it cooks. I did that the last time I made soup, and it was awesome.
I have been lucky enough to have never mixed up teaspoon and tablespoon. I live in fear now
If they can't handle a fourth tablespoon of black pepper in a casserole they should NEVER eat the stuff I cook for myself.
I Jewish and we always eat matzo ball soup it is sooo good
"Kinda tastes like taxes" 💀
because of this video, anytime I see Pepa anywhere I just go "Pepa? What are doing in my soup?" love watching this, you're amazing~
Ratatouille 🐁
may I suggest Joshua Wiesman
6:01 thanks papa johns
I cut myself applying too much pressure to a dull knife while cutting an apple. It wasn’t a bad cut, though.
Illy: Spaghetti Papyrus: “OH NO! YOU’RE MEETING ALL MY STANDARDS!”
Oh hey you also have a gas stove
You cut yourself with a potato peeler I did that when I was 10 and it was easy and fun for some odd reason
Something I can say from experience: apple cutting CAN be dangerous- I cut like a 3 line square (almost a full square) then I stopped and made my little sister do it for me lol (she’s a year younger than me and WAY better at cooking n stuff
I would love to be your friend one day you’re so positive and happy all the time😊
Peppa what are you doing in my soup
Just realized this video is almost a year old. Crisis time 😍
Num num num tastes like taxes
have you thought about doing a behind the scenes of one of these episodes😊?
Im not afraid of cooking and i cook very well!  Also im 10-
yea when i have to flip tortillas without a comal i turn off the stove, flip it, and turn it back on 😭
I’ve known how to use the oven and the stove since I was about 8 I think? I was quite lucky lol, I don’t find it very hard to cook
I love how she has little anime things in her videos
the soft “peppa what are you doing in my soup? 🍜🥣🍲”
Y’all I am NOT joking. MOTZO BALL SOUP IS SO ****ING GOOD 😭😍😍😍🥘 the motzo balls pretty much taste like chicken noodle soup in one little ✨doughy bready delicious ball✨ I put chicken and carrots in it but I think potatoes would be good too
I love mothzaball soup
I know I'm 11 months late, but there was one time where I was peeling an apple and accidentally cut myself really badly, and when I mean really badly, I do MEAN IT. There was literally blood flowing out of the cut. Don't worry tho, I'm fine now and the cut has healed.
I learned to cool when I was six which is honestly kind of lucky because it is so helpful in real life lol
i'm sorry about asking this but, how do you get cut by potato peeler like, don't they have safety guards on them. but i'm stupid so i'm not sure.
Do you eat matzo ball
My dream job is to be a baker
I remember that one time when I was 8 or 9 years old I was helping my mom peel the potatoes then I ended up cutting myself and there was a lot of blood.
I LOVE GREEN BEAN CASSEROLE, Yes!!!
You're right it's a blessing when illymations posts a video hairy godmother
I came here to watch a video about cooking and I left craving matzah ball soup. it’s been way too long since I’ve had it, thank you for reminding me of it’s glorious existence.
My favourite food as a kid was black beans and white rice with queso fresco
6:19 idk why but Illy kinda sounds like bridgette from trolls on this part-
Says be safe after slicing her finger lol
A quick tip to prevent over-peppering your food: get a set of those tiny glass or silicone bowls and measure each of your seasonings separately and double check before you mix them into the food. Also just a general tip is to take some salt and measuring spoons and measure the salt into your hand repeatedly until you can accurately measure each amount of salt into your hand without the spoons.
Green been casserole my love<3
I like how maaz made that pun in the end, lol 🤣😂 also, I like ur animations, and I get how to take a long time to put them.
The amount of times illy said balls is crazy
chicksn fajitas sound nice
U just got an new sub :D
“Matzo ball soup” now im hungry 🤤
I love green bean casserole :>
I miss you
This is so cool
Ok, so on a personal note, I’m Jewish. My family isn’t highly religious, but we do celebrate all of the major holidays, and every Passover we used eat Matzo ball soup. Sure we celebrate Cristian holidays too, like Fat Tuesday (Pazkis yum), Easter, Christmas, etc. but we also celebrate OUR holidays, so on a PERSONAL level I relate to the matzo ball soup tasting like family, because it does, it reminds me of my grandpa and when my grandma, my mom and I used to make them by hand. We haven’t made Matzo Ball soup in a few years, but man, I miss those spongey, delicious balls of home, then I don’t know what longing is.(if I see ANY antisemitism in the replies imma throw hands)
6:19 dead asf 💀
I'm 18 and I cook dinner almost every day for my family, and thankfully I have not chopped off any of my fingers yet... but I have underestimated the vegetable peeler..... BEWARE THE PEELER
"Peppa, what are you doing in my soup"  💀
This video is *MAGICAL*
9:28 How you clean when it no like water
Kinda tastes like taxes 😐
I thinks it’s funny how she hides a little shoto in every video
Bro-         I LOVE THAT FREAKING SOUP!!!! My mom would always make it for dinner
Illy: “Luigi if you know what’s good for don’t come in here”
In are family we eat soop with mazaballs all the time and I love it ( But we call them Kneidlech )
I grew up in the south and a still dont like green bean casarole
Watching this reminds me of my last kitchen disaster.  I tried making a Tuscan bean soup in my slow cooker about a year ago. I followed all the instructions on how to make it...but forgot to soak the dried beans overnight first.  The end result had me eating one bowl of it during my lunch break at work...and immediately run to the bathroom to, let's say "evacuate my mistake."  I ended up being sent home from work with a messed up uniform & terrible indigestion.  Moral of the story: be very careful when cooking with beans!
I could've used this 15 muinets ago when I hurt my self cookin-
I don't and never have lived in the south BUT my mother can make ANY casaroll taste amazing (I hate green beans but love green bean casaroll)
My style of cooking is: 1. Comes up with some random combination of ingredients 2. makes it 3. enjoys it, while my family suffers in the background.  (my personal favorite outcomes of this are macaroni and brioche sandwiches, and caramel chicken nuggets)
THE SOUP SONG IS AMAZINH
ok but like when she did her "become the seasoning" ily that was OTHERWORLDY!!!!!!!!
green bean casserole is hella good
after watching this i walked through my house singing soup time
Matzo balls is kinda like an international version of Indian Maggi. 😂
I love your videos!!!
Who also didn't read the as in the title?
5:53 Grace field meat... Would you like the connie or the emma ear
I love spaghetti, and my favorite part about it is that, like matzo ball soup, you can put anything as long as it tastes good! I recommend fennel seeds, garlic salt, and Italian seasoning *Chefs Kiss*
My nana makes green beans casiral always
that's exactly how my mom makes matzo ball soup
Matzo ball is hard make for me cuz I need rules
Mmmmmm! Can't forget the noodles and a tuna fish sandwich! 🤤
Illymation: *turns on stove* Also illymation: AHH!
Green bean casserole is delicious
my brother said ew and he looks like the dude...
Thank god I’ve learned how to cook at a young age

You are so funny , I love your videos 🥺
Green bean casserole is like my favorite thing to have on thanksgiving! My family makes it homemade and it’s so delicious.
Oh gosh. I had the same thing happen to me with a peeler!
Oh yeah. This is literally a holiday food
In the wisdom of Alton Brown , organization will set you free! (mean read recipe and plan ahead and know all the steps before you actually start).
Oh im so making matzo ball soup, appreciate the vegan alternative so i can share it with my crush
Green bean casserole is the literal best
I just found this channel and it's honestly amazing. I was really touched by the pride you take in making your soup and your comment about how it makes you feel better. I'll definitely have to try making it sometime!
When she said soup first i thought she was gonna start singing super idol
Me: learns to cook a ridiculous amount of foods at age 6
Elllo :)
The most complicated thing I make is chicken Alfredo.  But my two favorite things to make that feels gourmet is frozen pirogies with sautéed onions, and cheese steak sandwich made of steakums (steakums are thin slices of beef that you can buy frozen at the store)
Soup
I ordered a custom black apron with the heart pattern with an image of Jeff the Killers face
Papa jhon
Mom loves to cook, and taught me how to cook basic dishes, at least I think they are basic, like how to make Mac and Cheese, lemon pepper chicken or fish, taco meat, spaghetti, etc. Once you know the basics of cooking one recipe, some elements apply to other recipes. Like adding a little bit of vegetable oil to boil most pasta recipes, as to lower the chance of the pasta sticking to the pot.
illy you really like jjk don't you
PRO TIP, PARENTS: It's okay if you want to spoil your kid by making for them delicious foods (DON'T JUST BUY TAKEOUT!!!) but if you want them to survive in life on good meals, then it's better if you teach them form an early age how to cook. I was just 7 when my mom already instructed me how to make pancakes, muffins and I could do it on my own basically if I knew what to put into the dough. Now, at the age of 20 I am confident in the kitchen and have made a lot of times the dinner and lunch for my family.  Kids are clever and can learn anything safely if they are watched and positively guided through each step. They can adapt to the kitchen well, too.
"And I was going to make green bean casserole" Me: *cheers in texan*
i like pepper   I LOVE PEPPER.
10 yr me cooks eggs and makes pouched eggs, fried rice AND YET NOT EVEN AFRAID OF THE OIL!     me rn
Imagine if a noodle was a “Sponge”
PEpA wHAt ArE YoU DoInG iN mY SOup
fun fact, i learned to cook when i was 9
I cant relate to this because my mom taught me how to cook a bake VERY young like I was making muffins by myself a 2
I’m so glad I’m not the only one who’s made the tablespoon/teaspoon mistake. Except I did it with cinnamon in an apple pie. I used like half a thing of cinnamon and thought “well that’s odd” but didn’t think to double check.   Now I quadruple check my measurements even if I’ve made a recipe 50 times
In my entire life i lisent Mazeballs soup but he lisent good 👁️🐽👁️🤙🏼

One time my mom was slicing some cheese and the cheese slicer- holy- it cut right into her thumb and like- took off a chunk of it + a chunk of her nail. That was the most blood I’ve ever seen come out of one wound at once. She didn’t slice cheese for months after.
6:56  Oh look,we made a universe soup
Step one: eggs and oil z Step two: mix that mix in  Step three: CHILL OUT

Me living for green bean casserole since I was younger-

5:53 can we talk about the uchiha tears and gojo juice in the back…
YuCkY wUcKy! We stan Mazz Edit: I love green bean casserole, It was just funny
MATZO BALL IS AMAZING!
no  😅
My mum taught me to cook, and now i can bake by myself
I ended up making a habit of lifting the pan/pot from the burner. I watched Gordon Ramsay’s recipe for creamy scrambled eggs because I was tired of over cooked dried out eggs I made, and he’d lift it off the heat for a while stirring. It helps when pasta sauce starts sputtering or when you are not wanting to burn a crepe before you can flip it.
Why don't you try Hello Fresh?
0:11 lol
The moment I saw the peeler and the dancing I knew what was going to happen. It's an honest mistake, one I've even seen professionals make. Honest opinions I see it as a moment of passage in the kitchen. XD
Good thing im learning how to cook at a young age, so I dont have to learn when i’m older
meanwhile I've taken 3 cooking classes throughout high school and here i am in college eating mcdonalds
“Don’t be like me be safe!” Me who burned my finger making a FREAKING BURRITO: Ah. Wish I knew that 2 weeks ago.
"Green been caseroll yucky ucky"  *Me, puts down my plate of green bean caseroll* Am I a joke to this....Mr. Glasses Person?????
I saw the itadori's meatballs recipe and I might just check it out.
One of the most important things when cooking is simply don't get distracted, don't watch videos or shows or anything, especially if you're inexperienced so you won't burn anything mess up the recipe
Once I was cutting an avocado and had a similar injury to your peeler, but on my thumb joint and with a knife. Skin flap buddies!
Mom's matzo ball soup is the best during passover dinner.  Espacially if the balls are made from crushed matzas (which you can find everywhere during passover)
“gReEn BeAn CaSsOrOlE yUcKy” She AWLAYS makes me laugh
me and my sis  started cooking when we were 9
This was almost a year ago, but I'm just taking a moment to appreciate the singing skills
I freaking love illys humour 🤣
Soup with chocolate sauce and garlic.
I should send this to my friend whos an absolute noob at cooking lmao. She recently learnt how to cook spaghetti. Its bizarre to see people who dont know how to cook as someone who's family's love language is cooking for others. Not only that but they are pretty traditional so i was taught how to cook in my childhood as an afab. It is really useful and i love cooking for my friends.
i love the luigi clothing/decorations-
Soup Time Reprise (Injury Time) makes me laugh Every. Single. Time.
If you ever cook for someone else always make sure your not sick you wash your hands and your hair is tide up and make sure to wash your dishes not doing these things can lead to foodborne disease which can lead to them getting very sick and can be vital   Foodborne symptoms  Diarrhea  Nausea  Cramping  Vomiting   Foodborne is usually found in children and in the elderly
I was surprised when she mentioned Matzo ball soup, had it during my first pass over sadder a few years back, I also like gefelta fish too, except this one year both the fish and soup were meh, the fish was actually grouse I think?? ps not Jewish yet.
GREEN BEAN CASSEROLE MY BELOVED (I prefer the green beans in a can though lol)
4:35 THE JJK POSTERRRR
I live in the north (Michigan), and I LOVE green bean casserole.
We need a full version of Soup Time
*THIS VIDEO WAS SPONSERD BY MOTZOBALL SOUP*
I am 11 years old and my mother is teaching me how to cook while I still don't know how to heat food up
BRO I MAKE GREENBEAN CASSEROLE ALLLL THETIME
The be safe thing is a must when i was 5 i was peelong a potatoe and ended up in the e.r with my thumb finhernail gone IANSNA
I tried matzoh ball soup after seeing this and I do not regret it one bit
Peeling ur own finger is INDEED the WORST. Illy is NOT kidding when she says to have ur tools as SHARP as POSSIBLE. It really does help.
I cut my hand open .This isn’t because of cooking .
did anyone else think of that one part of undertale when napstablook and frisk r laying on the floor then it turns to space
To paraphrase Kenji López-Alt: sharp is safe, dull is dangerous.
I started cooking in Kindergarten, so I'm decent now as an adult
Dude I'm 12 years old and I can cook like a gourmet chef 👩‍🍳
I I don't enjoy all the fingers that I was born with so let's cut some off
Cooking is alot of fun. I know alot of people who dont enjoy it. Mainly because they dont like messing up. It's sad they dont like it but I get it failing can be hard. My little sister now living with her boyfriend away from family. Has had to learn to cook for herself out of necessity. We actually started honding more now that she's having to cook. Not gonna lie makes me proud
I agree with her so much, I love matzoh ball  soup
Do half mushroom half creamed chicken soup for the green bean casserole
I’m 15 i love to cook for my family but this video is still hilariously fun to watch despite my extensive knowledge of cooking
Can somebody tally how many times she says “Matzo balls” or “Matzo ball soup”
I feel like the texture of matzo ball soup would kill me
Last time used a peeler I skinned half my finger and im never using one again
12 almost 13 yo, says green bean casserole  is tge best
Hey illy just so u know for green bean casserole for next time if u add too much pepper. Add more water and/or add more soup if u use the soup. This info was brought to u by my mom!
Uchiha tears 😂
yummy finger peace
Everyone in my family makes matzah ball soup for Hanukkah and it is the BEST THING EVER! It’s my favorite Jewish tradition, but the best part is when they don’t turn out too perfect. (Whether the matzah balls are too big, or the potatoes burn, or my mom adds too much baking powder etc) it just makes everything better when we learn from ours  mistakes, plus the soup ALWAYS tastes a little different than it did last year. It’s so cool to see others cooking my favorite recipe 🥰
pepa? what are doing in my soup?
Wait… isnt knowing how to hold a kmife basic knowledge😀
Is she Jewish?
alright since people were being rude, imma juusstt *erases all that* ....anyway :D
I know how to cook but only like a few things. Those things being...  1. Grilled Cheese 2. Ramen 3. Egg Rice 4. Quesadilla I can make some pretty great ramen so in my house we have a bunch of ramen packets.
Try cooking some cubed chicken breast or beef to that soup you make and see if you could create your own concoction, you might surprise yourself 😊☺
I actually like extra peper
It surprises me everyday that there are so many people my age and a little older don’t know the basics of cooking, I’m so glad I learned from my grandmother. My fiancé is a chef, I’m no chef but I’m glad I know a little more (even though home chef basics) than him and can cook.
Illy : peppa what are u doing here?  Peppa from encanto : "starts to rain"  Illy : well hope you guys like water flavor soup
Ever since second grade I made my own food, although when I was 11 I got depression and lost all motivation to do anything 👍
I was able to cook my first ever meal it was a girl cheese sandwich and I was 110 that was the most simplest and easiest to cook yeah it’s that simple it’s just you butter the bread and cheese for the bread and you put bread on top then you just flip it over and keep on flipping over and says fully cooked that easy then you just sleep on the sofa while you eat your sandwich or a grilled cheese one then you’re done do you go it’s that simple
Stop killing my people please <3 also love your videos
one time i added 1 1/2 cups of oil to my brownies instead of just 1/2 and i realized this and almost cried
nobody:  illy: pApA jOhNs >:D
Need to go follow you on insta now lol. Also would totally try matza ball soup but my eating disorder is preventing me atm but I will prevail someday. Hopefully. But green bean casserole doesn't sound bad.
WHOOOOOOw GREEN BEAN CASSAROOOOOOOOLE.# the best tho
At least you're trying!!! You can do this!
I learnt how to cook as a kid
“Kinda tastes like taxes” killed me im sorry-
I found out that spam plus green beans and pan seared onions tastes very similarly to green bean casserole.
It sounds like Illy needs an instant pot.
Man your turning into a furry with your lion king and your weird cat noise
Ur my comfort youtuber I watch you whenever I'm sad or bored and stuff has been sucky recently so you a lot more views lol
I grew up in Michigan and we love our green bean casserole its so good.
2:07 lizard people can
When she said wooden spoon, the first thing I thought was: a oatmeal container, a wooden bowl, *a plastic wahta bottle and a paper towel role*
lol I have been cooking since I was 7 years old and I am 10
I I learned how to cook when I was about  9 to 11 years old and now I know how to cook all dishes but one day when I was 12 y old I cut myself and I still have a scar there was blood everywhere by the way I'm 12 years old it wasn't as bad as like when I was 9 years old and I cut myself with a freaking buzz saw yeah that's really happened and the buzz saw was for cutting bread not for cutting fingers
I love green bean casserole
Just don’t be like me and forget to turn off the burners and stove sometimes and don’t cook late at night like 10 o’clock if you don’t have to😂
🎂🤔"...tastes like taxes." 🤣🤣
why the thumbnail change
I concur with the green bean casserole statement it was amazing
Just found your channel. Binging now. Wish me luck
"Imagine if a noodle, was a sponge."  My mom: So, a dumpling?
I learned how to cook at 18 years old, at 23 it’s now my fave hobby.
will the soup crime song be on Spotify
I have matzoh ball soup every year on pas over
Ok but you didn't have food ec or something what happened?
I can relate that
Tardispawz's guide on how to make easy pasta for the whole family: You will need -pasta ingredients -pasta utensils idk How to make Try to make pasta Fail Order pizza 😁
People who don't know how to cook as an adult have parents who failed them in preparing them for life. Man, I was making my own meals, baking cookies, muffins, pies, cakes, when I was 13. When I moved out it felt no different.
I would love to try it, but I'm vegetarian :(
The o ly things I can cook is mean grilled cheese and some mac n chessd... but I can bake
If you’re having a hard time with sharp objects in the kitchen, there is a simple fix.  Cutting gloves.  They’re cheap —usually under $20. You only really need the one for the hand not holding the sharp thing, and they last forever. I worked in a kitchen for a couple of years and I never had a single cut. Because I never cut anything without my glove on.
Me watching this while cooking at 9:30pm:                Well then…
anyone can cook but it doesn't mean they should Remy the rat
I wonder if Illy just has a fear of fire
Lol luigi coming in on silly destroying that, probably disgusting toilet
1:55 I can attest to. I work as a prep cook so I'm chopping stuff a lot. Sharp knifes are less dangerous and less painful because dull knifes have ridges that can catch on objects (that's why it's hard to cut with a dull knife) which means less control. That also means that if you cut yourself, those ridges will catch skin, causing an even worst, even more painful cut. Seriously though, I've had cuts with a stupid sharp blade that didn't hurt.
Okay.. So how do I start this comment?... how do I write to a person that most-likely won't read this--- BY TRYING!!! HAHA. Okay but seriously, I have literally no idea how you came across my suggested videos when I first opened up my Youtube today after work..  but I'm so glad you did. (First video was the perks of having a period) Yes I clicked it... yes I watched like three more of your videos.. and yes.. here we are now.. typing you a comment that very will may never be read by you--- or at the very least make you laugh at some point.. and if that's the case- WOHOo, I'm happy I brought joy to you. Anyway, I can't help but notice all the little details you have in your videos... aside from your overall dorky personality (Which trust me, is a delight and meant as a complement) I can't help but see all the interests you have... You like Disney, My hero Academia, You added Haru from Free on the bus ride to the swim meet.. Freaking adding the volleyball boys all over the place to boot--- Spongebob--- all the way to singing a little song about soup and talking to your pets. I guess if you made it this far in the comment, I just want to say, from one socially awkward adult artist to another-- I think you seem like a generally good person and you should totally keep being who you are. I could see us being friends too lol But on a real note, I'm happy to have came across you and your videos. Keep up the great animation too! ^w^
What happened with you and the peeler happened to me too !
Yep, As Such I cannot be trusted with a Gas Stove. 🔥🔥🔥
I used to do some cooking with mom and baking with my aunt. Now I have some of the family recipes. Some even going back to Germany and Russia.  I also have a recipe for green bean casserole, it's super cheesy and I love it. Learned it from a friend down in Tennessee.
im a good (not perfect) cooker,and i made my own recipes,aaaaaand im 13...yea...power of god!...i think....
haha i added a table spoon of salt instead of sugar to my waffles once 😂 and it was only supposed to be a tea~spoon. oh well, the seagulls enjoyed it lol.
My twist on greenbean casserole   Fresh green beans(boil them first) Cream of chicken  Cream of mushroom  Ground beef( cooked obviously) Gound sausage (cooked obviously) Onion powder  Garlic powder  A little creole or Cajun seasoning( i don’t measure so season to taste)  STIR ALL THAT TOGETHER   Put in a baking dish add some shredded cheese ontop cover in aluminum foil and let it cook for about 20 mins on 350 and BAM   THANK ME LATER
I love green bean casserole! I love it when my mom makes it-
The blood adds flavor to the soup.
How do I get to the discriptions
*me being 12 and knowing very much how to cook, and cooks every week 😅*
The green bean casserole seems too white for me
I live green bean casserole
My mom wanted to be a chef. So I grew up helping her cook. I learned how to make gravy and sauces at 13. :D
Now I kind of want to try that recipe, buying 3 boxes: 1 with packet, 1 with your ingredient recommendation, and 1 where I go full Remy the rat
Hi
1:09 sOUp tIme ✨ 😩
You heard of cajun gumbo and if you have. have you tried it?
this is further proof that maaz is the best person to collab with
Omg!!! I'm so happy you talked about matzo ball soup!! It's my FAVORITE soup. I am jewish by blood, we aren't to big on celebrating lots of stuff from the religion but we like Hanukkah and I've been to pass over at my step grandparents house (who are also jewish by blood but also religious). My grandma (my bio mom's mom) would always make matzo ball soup growing up. Granted, it was from a box, and we still make it from a box but it's still SO delicious.   If you haven't tried matzo ball soup I definitely recommend getting a mix and making it. Carrots, onion and celery are what we like to add.  And if you have a big family, I recommend getting an extra box mix because at least for the 3 people in my house eat all the matzo balls and are still hungry. They are pretty airy. Illys explanation is the best I've heard of the soup. XD It's like sponge noodles but I would say taste a bit more eggy then normal noodles. Definitely give it a try of you haven't!!
Hello all! I would like to spread the gospel with you if you're willing to hear it. 😁💞   The world is messed up. Have you ever heard that saying, "Everyday, we stray further from God"? Never has that been truer than in the world we live in right now. There's an onslaught of selfish infighting, environmental disaster, and a piece of broken spirit in everyone.    We've all done bad, and that's called sin. It could've been anything: a tiny fib, cussing out your mum, or thirsting after pixels. Just like spilling black ink over a white t-shirt, sin will stain and remain. This uncleanness separates us from the Lord. Because of it, we're predestined to stew in Hell. Being just a good person, or working for a place in Heaven won't get us in.   "All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned everyone to his own way; and the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all."  Isaiah 53:6, KJV   "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God. . ." Romans 3:23, KJV   It looks grim.   Yet there's hope. See, God loves us. His Love?The greatest. His Love was so great that he gave us his only Son, Jesus Christ to bear the weight of all sin: past, present, and future.   "For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son that nobody should perish but have eternal life." John 3:16, KJV   Jesus was born mortal, and, just like us, experienced the hindrances of life.  Was sorely tempted by Satan, emotionally exhausted, fatigued from walking, cried over the wickedness of man, and at the very end, betrayed. Despite it all, Jesus went out perfect. Without a sin to His name.   He was crucified, and not once, did He wish ill will on those who harmed him so greatly. Jesus instead said,   ". . .Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do."  Luke 23:34, KJV   Just when you thought He was gone gone, He triumphed over death! He arose from it three days later!   That precious blood spilt, it's enough to make us clean again. White as snow. His suffering and His sacrifice wasn't for nothing, it can be our salvation. He did it to save you and me, so that we don't have to go to Hell. There isn't anything or anybody like Jesus Christ, our Champion in these dying times.   Jesus said,   ". . .I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father, if not by Me." John 14:6, KJV   Jesus doesn't ask for a million dollars, or that you go through a complex series of rituals to obtain salvation. It's a free gift. He only asks that you believe that He is your Savior, that He arose three days later, and repent from your sins and look to Him from this day onward. When you truly believe, your name is written in the Book of Life, and one day, whether the chapter of your life is coming to a close, or Jesus calls His children home, we can stand before Him and know that we will get to stay with Him for eternity. And really, there isn't anywhere else I'd rather be.   "For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God—not by works, so that no one can boast. For we are God’s handiwork, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do."  Ephesians 2:8-10, NIV
green beans i know them guisantes
"and then you make the balls, you make the BALLS, YOU MAKE THE BALLS!! :D" my fav part
Time to make some matzo ball soup :D
Me: I love to cook! Me. Thur., Feb. 24, 10:??, 2022: Why did my finger have to get jammed during PE???
6:19 that was random, but also really necessary
i started using knives since i was 6 no finger cuts am i god?????????????????????????????
Wait, green bean casserole is a southern thing?! I thought everyone had it, it's almost criminal that they don't. Its freaking delicious! 😋
So the book was wrong but you were right
"LISON LISON" Illy march 2021
Oh my goodness I just thought of something matzo ball soup and a bread bowl
That's a onion not a potato
Did this get demonetized for "promoting self hard" at 2:10?
I love cooking, especially from scratch. But when I season something I never measure, I add to it tastes right(or smells)
I need Gordon Ramsey to react to this
if you liked mazo ball soup you should try albondigas soup (its a Mexican dish but it is really good)
Any ingredient, any flavor, any spice. Papa Joh- wait, that's not right!
I was a trained chef and I’ve here to give a bit of advice, too much salt in certain dishes you throw peeled potatoes in let it soak it in then take it out. Too much black pepper try a little lemon juice should calm it down like using lime juice to take the sting out of spice
I was 7 when I learned how to cook
As someone who's also trying to learn how to cook. You just gotta keep trying. You'll find stuff your good at and stuff your bad.   I've found that I can make a fantastic Sautéed chicken and mustard sauce
*yeahthatsalotofpepperman-*
"I know how to hold a knife now." Almost drops it on foot*
"It was time....  *I had enough door dash"*
Pov that time my dad almost lost his thumb from a chain saw

My dad has done the pepper thing, but with hot sauce… it was not a fun night
Illy: "Im scared of opening the stove" *me who needs to use a fire stove lighter to open the stove* Me: i am four parallel universes ahead of you  jk, i just saw the perfect opportunity

taxes are theft. some say its part of the social contract but i dont renember signing it?
The things that I enjoy making are the simple things. Pasketti, desert such as cupcakes, cookies, brownies, eggs(I like to cook eggs cuz I can work with many different types of eggs to cook, over easy/medium, scrambled, which I can put in a samwitch, the list goes on!) Grilled cheese, bacon, bacon grilled cheese, egg bacon and cheese sandwich, avacodo toast, ovacodo toast sandwich. Ok, now making the list, I think some of this is a bit complicated, or it's just alot of simple things in one comment which makes it look complicated. Anyways, happy new year!
Green bean casserole is amazing I 100 percent agree with you.
Green bean casserole- *chiefs kiss*

I love green bean casserole it's really good lol
Do you just enjoy matzah ball soup or are you jewish?
As a 12 year old my mom lets me cook my own meals cuz i can cook the simple stuff and she is pretty confident that i know how to use a knife and there were some times where i almost got hurt but overall i was fine.When i was frying some eggs i accidentally touched the pan and for some reason i just kept quiet and moved my hand a few Inches away from the stove to the sink and washed my hands in cold water (It wasn't burnt or anything just stung a little)
I used cook with my mom
I know how to cook but i'm 7 years old
green bean castral is the best
What if we were born with no fingers🤔…lol
Whait, i noticed you have a good singing voice, are you ever considering career as a singer ?
I made meatloaf stuffed with cheese in side it. It's like a cheese burger cause you can put it on bread and boom insta cheese burger.
Yes
Jewish people watching the matzo ball scene like! 🤤🤤🤤
Plane Butt.
Me making macaroons at 10  Uhhhhhh
i dont have fingers
THE PEPPA PART HAD ME DEAD
she is a theater kid cause she can actually sing
Ever since I watched this video, I have been unable to make or eat soup without singing the soup time song
i think a huge reason why ppl struggle w this skill as an adult is bc their parents never taught them. so a parenting tip is to have your kids help make dinner also bc they'll be proud that they made it and wanna finish it, and they'll gain that skill.
I can barely make mug cake lol
She have to put (ft.TheAMaazing)
I died when you said PEPPA
You are alot like me I've done my share of cooking I think your awesome 😎.
Peppa pig I saw Peppa pig while you were staying calm
Am I the only one who misread the title as “learning how to cook an adult” instead of “learning how to cook as an adult”?
I didn't live in the south, but my dad used to make Green Bean Casserole
Never sing and dance and close your eyes while doing something in the kitchen
Ur right about matzoh ball soup it’s bussin
Did you have to say balls that many times tho..
Any flavour any food any spice, papa jo…… WAIT WAIT NO-
i learned how to cook using cooking mama
this whole time i wasnt subscribed- ive been watching u for 2 years-
I accidently cut my finger but instead of a regular cut it created a pocket in my finger
To be onist green beans are actually good with some chicken pickata
FURRY
I’m a Mexican grown child so I by default learned to make rice, beans, tortillas, and carne asada . That’s all. But at high school I began making international meals and continue to grow my recipe book in my head .
Only when watching illymation can I get an all out musical number about preparing soup
I just made some sour-dough it was not meant to be sour-dough. I regret nothing
Who noticed the thinknoodles reference in the supermarket before the remote section
I love green bean casserole
Mac stick = mix flour and eggs and get dough set it aside grab a cheese stick put the dough around stick two together watch till it gets a bit golden brown and voila Mac stick
Wth is the aMAZZing doing

can I put soap in in the matzo ball soup
Peppa what are you doing in my soup~ tiktok trend
The fact that I learned how to make scramble eggs at age 9
Its funny that you consider NORTH Carolina as "in the south" when everyone bellow yall consider yall as Northern 😂😂
I watch ted talk
First use stove when 10
Mmmm taxes
I cut myself with a potato peeler so I  feel you on that one
Idk why I started cooking when I was 5 or 6 and my cooking was perfect I_I
I was asking my mom (I’m 9) if I could Pappa Johns and vuala you said Pappa Johns
I figured out that I had to learn how to cook for myself when I was 10 before I go solo and burn down the kitchen. Sooo… I asked my mom for help on how to cook. That was not much help though, the only thing I learned about cooking from her was some tips and how to cut things. Everything else was feel it or see it! HELLO!!!! I HAVE NEVER COOKED BEFORE, YOU CAN ONLY FEEL IT WHEN YOU HAVE REFERENCES!!!!
did anyone eles reconized the jujitsu kisen painting in the back round
LOL I can't count how many times my mom has said "Oh sh*t I cut my thumb!" or "Sun of a b*tch burnt my hand!" She's a great cook tho :)
If something asks for one clove of garlic my mom will actually add anywhere between 3 and the whole bulb.  On the plus side I like garlic so that's nice for me, on the bad side now anything OTHER people make with garlic I'm like "hmm.  Needs some garlic."
boa is delicous but it takes like 5 hours to make
My mom  forced me to learn how to cook and now sometimes my mom tells me to cook and it was so easy and I’m 11
I’ll just find a way to remember my mum’s recipe for pumpkin and vegetable soup and cry over it not turning out how she cooks it. That is, if I ever have the money to move out, hahahaha
Ah yes I’ll take some uchiha tears
Am I literally the only one that loves cooking?like I started cooking when I was 6 and it was a egg. and OH MAMA was it crispy!(I love crispy!)

Idk✨

WAIT I have a question some adults are scared to turn on the gas cooker and use the knife WHAT I never knew this I'm 12 and I cook for myself regularly with the gas cooker but I think that's just my Asian blood showing yeah I am Asian
I grew up in the south- I hate green beans-
I love your videos you are amazing!!!!!!:) ;)
quick tip, get a knife sharpener, it might look like a bit of a investment but it's so worth it. No need for new chisors or knifes, just sharpen them! And don't put your knifes in the dishwasher please istg- And preperation is key, make sure all your ingredients are chopped, cleaned and ready before turning on that stove because trus me, you do not want to be running around your kitchen pealing your potatos while your food is burning on the stove ^^ and read your recipe trough all the way before starting! You don't want to be suprised while cooking
Ay cook alot

So funny!!! 7:10
I have a story very similar to this. One day it was my moms birthday and so me and one of my cousins had the bright idea to make apple flavored cake. Instead of adding the sugar we added salt instead as sugar and salt look so alike and instead of making a lovely apple cake flavored with the most delectable of spices we make the most saltiest cake in existence.

I have a question why does illymations only heart famous YouTubers? It’s not a bad thing I’ve just noticed that
Poor Maaz When You Kick Him Out Lol Edit:I Love When Illy Explains Why Green bean Casserole Is So Good Maaz Is Happy But When She Says The Bees Knees He Gets Disappointed
Yeah cartoons are the best they can do anything in the world and them never be Hurt unless they wanted them to get hurt
I swere sge gose back and changes the thumb nail
When I’m cutting and the knife doesn’t go through, back and forward rotation to cut through it. Don’t cut your hands kids.
❤ I started cooking when I was about six and a half and my signature dish was tofu sisig and filipono adobo but I understand that there always room for improvement ❤
I grated some skin on my thumb one time 😃  (I know im late to this video-)
I love green bean casserole!❤
You are Remy... I AM REMY THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!
Tbh the peeler one gives me flashbacks to like a year ago when I almost cut my finger off, it went abit deep and it took awhile to heal

Illy...you...just got...A NEW SUB
Holy shit I learned more from this video than my mother
Better than my mom could teach me
Finally, someone agrees with my opinion on matzo ball soup
"Uchiha tears" Lol'
To be fair, you can compensate with the knife when doing anything delicate by gripping it by the back of the blade instead of the handle. Gives you a bit more control that way. Doesn't work if you need to chop & dice, though.
I've never had matzo ball soup before but I NEED TO HAVE IT I saw a picture it looks amazing.
I learned to cook when I was very young, my family taught me a lot about preparation, and some stuff I learned on my own
Those potatoes were thicc
Poor injury time

*Gasp* Peppa 🐷 what 😀 are 😔 you 🥺 doing 😩 in 😳 my 🤭 soup 😎
This inspired me to make........       An apple 🍏
3:27 XDD Did you seriously draw a bu## hole on that plane?!?!
2:20 _....when you realize some people don't know things you learned as a literal five-year-old.._     It helps sometimes to be the oldest of 5, helping your parents prepare meals for the family often. And since potatoes are now so prevalent in my mind, I learned how to peel and cut those suckers way back when I was 9 I think, and ever since, when it comes to big Thanksgiving preparations I have often been put in charge of that job. since we have such a big family, often we have a LOT to do. I remember one year standing for one to two hours straight doing nothing but peeling a _mountain_ of potatoes! It was a good experience though...got to zone out a lot.
Only legends remember when this video had a different title and thumbnail
All I know how to make from scratch is mash potatoes
Wheyt im shure that There is an easter egg of ignia from nexomon 1 in the fumnaile

I’m both scared and glad I’m being taught how to cook by both my school and mom but, I scared because, how many people got hurt before they started teaching cooking at my school/ other schools( it’s a mandatory subject).

The fact that she wears glasses and still messed up the green bean casserole
Gordon Ramsay once said "A sharp enough knife will do half the work for you in cooking."
I love cooking! And definitely does make me feel better! And experimenting is the best! I made an oxtail stew a couple of days ago! Oxtail fights me in the pressure cooker cause I don’t have the patience for the 2637855 hours it takes to cook, but I’m getting there! Lasagna is another specialty I make well, but my favorite is my chicken soup cause like your soup it makes me feel better! Gonna make that tomorrow 😊
I spent today just watching ur vetio
-properly use a knife and other sharp kitchen things to cut stuff up- *Wield a nichirin blade to slay all your ingredient enemies* Corporate needs you to identify the difference between these pictures me: they're the same picture 0-0

Didn’t this have another title card or was that just me?
when i cook all i think is food wars anime that is all like i feel intense in the kitchen although thats probably bc working in an Italian restaurant for a year plus some other restaurants sprinkled in there think it comes naturally xD tho definitely gonna try le mozza ball soup sometime
I made this with my mom when I was young and she told me to choose the seasonings and I put like 5 teaspoons of salt 😅
Hay you ever tried putting bacon grease in your green beans, it’s really good
Hi illy
when you said "your big motsa balls" dude that was really sus
Grilled cheese is my motziball soup ( sorry if I spelt that wrong )
I just tried matzo balls and they are SO GOOD
I’m good beacause My mom has like 30 and i am 10 and my mom still doesn’t know how to make butter cookies with frosting and me can do it
I caught that JJK!
your mozza balls recipe reminded me of that time my mom got me a potato dumpling kit, because I REALLY liked potato dumplings, and I got to taste them at the daycare center I attended as a kid.  My mom then suggested: "Why make them so big?! It's so annoying to cut em up when they're so big! Let's just make those dumplings golfball sized, so they'll both cook faster, and be more enjoyable to eat!" And it was a good idea.
eeyo she change the name and the look of the vid
Fun fact: this was changed
*extremely deep voice* ~~~baking gloves~~~
Did the thumbnail change??? :O
I want to be the very best like no cook every was get ingredients its my real test but the cook them is my goal

Here is my kitchen story, I was in my kitchen peeling and splitting some apples for my family's cows, I was using too small of a knife and slit the base of my thumb! It really hurt and because I was cutting apples, the juice got into the cut and it burned! Be careful with knives!
Lcol
u bad cook
I'm 14 and I can cook
dude, i have done the same thing with a peeler the side of my fingertip was gone 👍
Her eye brows look like almonds

Ironically, I saw a cooking ad before this.
2:23 The base of a blade is called a ricasso.
Soup time is my new fav song

When I was little I accidentally cut myself with a razor because I scraped it on one of my fingers have no idea what was gonna happen I did it 2×1 time when I was just like five years old and one time when I was like nine years old
Did Jaden cameo in your vid?!
Matzo ball soup is so good
I once was marketing a grilled cheese and I had the stove on high heat and when I flipped it like ten minutes later the side that it was cooking on was fully black and my older brother was with me and he laughed and took a pic and posted it on his story I think
My family puts tater tots o. Top of green bean casserole
Rip my fingers ! I once cut off my finger nail with a potato pealer . This happened Saturday (the one I’m now talking about) I was cutting wood to heat the house in winter (we have a wood stove) and the dam wood and spliter made my pinkie and my ring finger explode tommorow I’m getting surgery :,)
Matzo ball soup is soo good during Chinese New Year time because that good luck charm flow through your house and on to clothes mirror bed phone makeup and you   Plus it feels like home and when your mom reading bed time story while you’ re sick and eating eat on the couch soo home feeling ^-^
"Kinda Tastes like taxes"

8000th comment
6:42 I wish I could be that peaceful and ambiant floating in a soup bowl and turning into an interdimentional rift
Illy, you seem to really like the DS. There is a cookbook for DS called Personal Trainer Cooking! I really recommend it, as I’ve used it and it really works! I’ve made Banana Brownies with it.
Girl :l im 10 and i can make spaghetti 🍝.I’m not papyrus
You do know that you can just throw eggs on a pan and it makes scrambled eggs (it works)
Hiss like a cat
with the whole not a good cook thing I fail at making cookies one of the simplest things to make because I either add too much/too little flour , I overcook them and set off the fire alarm or I end up making a mess of not just the cookies but the floor the worktop and/or myself
"They've got mittens!"  Luz: **Le gasp** GIMME THAT CODE!!!
Here for the chaos
Yeah, cuz literally I used too much oil for my brownies 🤡 triple check guys 💀
Has Illy seen the Animal Crossing Direct yet?
Im a kid and I can use stove knives and cook but I can only cook beans hot dogs ramen eggs and bacon on stove:^
As soon as i heard green bean casrol...   *shocked pikachu face*
*when your 11 and you can cook*
the best way that the food is not too peppery or salty do not add anything unless the recipe forces you to say sorry for bad English is a translator
Head space should hire her
I did not expect furry illy today
‘Ew green beans and casserole YUCKY WUCKY no thank you’
5:59 IZAIZA ITS ZA IZA SOUP

Todoroki magnets... *inner otaku appears*
“Peppa.. what are you doing in my soup?”
I actually really like green bean casserole lol
Are you Jewish? Just asking I’ve seen a 6 point star (holy Star of David) as well as matzo ball soup is a Jewish delicacy and matzo is a bread with no leavening if you don’t want to say that’s ok!
I’m most likely even worse soooo….
this killed me: 6:19
1:01 words can not explain how cute this  moment is
I’m really happy that my dads a chef cause at my age 11 I’m able to make a perfect medium rare butter basted steak
I'm in England, but some of my family is American so we still do thanksgiving. We make really extravagant dishes, but green bean casserole is the absolute best, we only get to have it once a year though
i cuted my finger by a peeler tho but a knife  it never hurted me wierd
My fav cook is cheese chicken u cut ur chicken and then fry it now add ur cheese mix it and eat it with rice and muah do goood
If you want a simple but unhealthy recipe then read this  so  1: Boil and prepare elbow pasta  2: if you have Doritos the. crush them up and sprinkle them in the pasta 3: if you have bbq sauce / bbq lays chips the crush/squeeze the bbq sauce /sprinkle the chips in the pasta  4:if you have American cheese the. Put it on the pasta and let it melt in the microwave  5: TADAAAAAA the dish CHESSA PARTYA ENJOY
The beep when she censored a bad word sounded like my alarm clock and I almost shat myself cause it scared me lol
Maaz: jokingly insults green bean casserole  Me: *pulls out a gun* GET OVER HERE YOU LITTLE-
Instructions unclear, I am now covered in soup
Beautifully said Illy! Cooking is a fun challenge
First when you have kids and you’re not a good cook your kids will say mom can I have some matzoh ball soup
As the daughter of a Pakistani home mom, I guarantee you that while watching this I felt like a *MASTER*
Are you Jewish
6:18 be like sus!
3:36 IF YOU MAKE THAT SHIT RIGHT IT WILL NO JOKE MAKE A MONDAY GOOD
I made matzo ball soup today but it didn’t have a seasoning packet so it was really bland because I tried to add things but it was weird
I’m eating matzo ball soup at the moment lol
I'm 9 and I can make spaghetti is that good or am I going to not have me fingys
illy,im 11 and even i can turn on the stove without being that scared
I’ve been wanted to try Matzoball soup SOOOO BAD ever since I watched this video but I literally can’t find it at my local Walmart and I’m sad
Funny thing about me as a cook. Well, 2 actually. First is i only ever have to cook following a recipe once. After that, i can eyeball everything from memory. Second thing, i am like 90% sure i won my current girlfriends heart by making my homemade irish stew.
Here is how to cook  Step 1: use your 5 pence from yt  Step 2 dont sell a ds or 3ds Step 3 buy personal trainer cooking
one time me and my mates made a green bean cassarole for shites and giggles we over seasoned a lot it made me cough and I'm not allergic to black pepper
Hi
0:03. No, but I do have 2 woks and a medal spatula to cook all my food. And no, I'm not scared to turn on the fire. Unless the gas is spread all over the house. In which if that happens, switch on your fan and open doors and windows near the kitchen.
Do people really use measurements?
9:18 if you pause at JUUUUUUUUUUST the right moment.... FACE
Bruh I love green beans and I don’t come from the south and broccoli is good😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😒😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎
International food aisle sign:   "Uchihiha tears"   I want that in my soup :).
How does it feel that a 12 year old can peel vegetables without injuries
Ah cooking. I've cooked since I was a kid.. didn't stop me from gouging my thumb for the 3rd time in my life just a week and a half ago. Still healing, but mostly back to normal. Damn you zucchini.
3:40  when you actually like green bean casserole ;-;
Thank you for mo puns
What Is casserole?
I have never even ate Casserole in my entire life
70% of the comments are children flexing they can cook the rest 30% is tragic injury stories lol
Wow! As a Jewish person Matza ball soup will ALWAYS make me think of my great grandmothers house
you have been arrested for soup crime what’s your alibi
O
Luckily I’m taking a culinary class so I’ll be semi prepared for when I’m 18 and out of the house
i loved cooking from my little life.means kid
Here's a recepie you can try 3 cups of flour  ½ cup of sugar  2 eggs (optional)  1 TEAspoon of baking soda And use milk until it has the consistency of oblek or thick syrup put it on a oiled pan on medium and cook untill it's just a tiny bit burned/charred. Or if the pan isn't buttered enough it will be similar to a fat pancake.
I only know how to make eggs and fat pancakes   And I'm all out of eggs
As 7th grader learning how to cook because I want to become a professional chef or a restaurant owner... thank you for reminding me of these things even if I already know them >:))
Let me go make my explosive soup!!!!
Illy: like a cat hissssssssss
But that soup song was dope tho
I can't enjoy green bean casserole because my aunt put a LOT of olive oil mayonnaise in it when we were kids and that turned me off from it forever.  My aunt traumatized me with many kinds of foods that most people would love that I can't eat because she RUINED them. She also chased me with a lawnmower at 10 because "I needed to exercise more"
I love cooking. Since during my childhood my dad worked a lot of hours, I spent all the day with my mom, so I watched her doing all the house work, hence by the time I was 12 I knew how to do them, but out of them I loved getting into my kitchen and start making food for my family.  And yes I have cut and burn myself a bunch of times, some even left a few  scars, but I take those as a medal of honor to show my efforts to make progress as a cook.
I used a recently sharpened meat knife for an onion and I cut myself. There was a river of blood. I have a scar from it and I cut myself on the same finger whilst making salad. Specifically while cutting the end of a tomato. I noticed the mortar and pestle in the background. It's much like mine, but mine has a base. Never use soap for a mortar and pestle. I'm proficient with cooking and it puts me in a good mood. I do take criticism and I'm very self conscious about my cooking. 🍳🥟
Omg I love green bean cassarolle— dang it now I’m hungry
“You’re a good dishwasher too!” As a guy I’m not saying anything
if i eat your food it will be perfect
my mom makes such GREAT green bean casserole is so flippin good. 😁
As a person from the north, green bean casserole slaps during holidays and was definitely a favorite of mine growing up 🥰
I like to make my little favorite mac and cheese bowl and I like SpaghettiOs if you don't know what's videos are they're basically spaghetti but they are turned into little zero o shapes but my favorite soup when I'm not feeling well when I can eat anything big or small is chicken noodle soup even though I take out the chicken I hate chicken hate all meats
I once completely cut off the tip of my finger
When I was 8 I knew how to cook two things grilled cheese and eggs.
buy an electric stove btw I love ur videos!
One time when I was little I was cooking and I apparently left the wooden spoon to close to the stove and I went in the other room to watch tv and my dad walks in with the spoon on fire saying this this is why you don’t leave the friggin spoon by the stove all while waving it around
Peppa what are you doing in my soup
Thank you for working with a small business who needs and deserves a shoutout
pEpPa wHaT aRe YoU dOiNg iN mY SoUp
I’m in 6th grade and I love to cook and I’m decent at it
I learned a little bit how to cook when i was 9
PEpPa WAt R u DoINg iN mY sOUp.
5:51 looks at the item board it says grace filed meat it's a really scary thing if you understood the reference
And I know how to make dough
I'm 10 and i make grilled cheese and eggs
6:04 **Adds ghost pepper** :P
YAY for Jewish representation! Matzah ball is soooo good and way better than chicken noodle!
with the greenbean casserole dish i would recommend if you do over pepper it again is possibly add lemon juice to hopefully balance the pepper, and salt
what's a casserole??  i've been wondering this for so long!!!  /gen
I love your videos and we have so much in common that’s my favorite castle and that is my favorite soup
I won’t judge you i love potatoes
I like cooking/baking (my other hobbies fit in with my reasons, as well), but there are a few things that annoy me about it. I make dishes to be amazing. I season it, I make sure it's throughly cooked, (how people eat food not well done, I have no clue. Strong stomachs, I guess) and generally work hard to make them. But.....here's where my issues are.  I bring them in for family dinner or just dinner in general because I now live my brother after grandpa died. (The only one to appreciate ANYTHING I did.) Most of the time, even when they specifically ask me to make the dish, NO ONE TOUCHES IT!!!!!!!!  Reason 1) they changed their minds and wanted something else or my brother stops to get fast food instead of the dish HE requested that I spent ALL DAY making.  Reason 2) they don't like how I season it and when I don't season, they think it's bland. Not to mention they always go for the other dishes before mine, so it's usually cold before they eat it and of course food meant to be eaten warm/hot won't taste as good cold.  Reason 3) it no longer suits their tastes and thought I had already been told by everyone else, despite EVERYONE knowing that I'm literally the LAST person to know anything going on because they think it's better to "shield" me from perceived disappointment. (Grandpa dying right in front of me was the ONLY time I was in the loop for anything and they depended on ME for news.)   As well with cooking and baking, I also sew, knit, crochet, and make soap. I make all these gifts for everyone, I always overhear them say how they don't like my gifts and are only nice because I'm Autistic.  These hobbies ain't cheap and me just giving them stuff I could make bank on just makes me wish I only had my brother and my Aunt Lis' kids left as family.  My step mom is nice though and tricked me into accepting money for the soap I was gifting her and her family. I guess just gifting about $100 worth of soap, she felt I needed some cash.
I made mottza ball soup before it’s good!
ı know how to cook and ı am just 13 old
U should make that apron merch
I grew up making matzo ball soup and I love it
Hey Illy, I love your videos and I have a very simple food that I love. I call it ✨fancy ramen ✨ ok so get an instant ramen package, boil water in a tea kettle, Sautéed mushrooms and green onions, make a fried egg maybe put some garlic in there put the seasoning and the noodles in a bowl for everything else in there and then wham  Bam you have fancy Ramen
2:22 So I'm Not Supposed To Hold It By The Blade
I’m still afraid off the oven

Mixing up teaspoon and tablespoon is very common lol

One time my mum accidently put spicy stuff on the apple pie instead of cinnamon
Anyone else noticed Jujitsu Kaizen in that picture?
your videos make me feel so good
My brother did the same thing with the potato peeler
Don't feel bad Illy.  When I was living with my parents I cooked dinner for everyone because I really loved to cook.   I got some Ritz crackers out of the pantry to make meatloaf with.  When we all sat down and ate it. It tasted really friggen sweet. This is a meat loaf. It shouldn't be sweet. It was so sweet we couldn't eat it and had to drink a gallon of tea between the 4 of us.  Turns out I had used my mom's sweet and cinnamon Ritz Crackers.   Always read your ingredient packaging kids.
lol i watched this this afternoon, went down to the kitchen to peel potatoes and immediately sliced my finger too
I turn on the stove with a match at 11 lmao (no hate)
*EWWWW GREEEN BEEANNNS, A CASSEROLE! YUCKY WUCKY!!!! NO THANK YOU.*
im 10 and know how to cook lots of stuff like beef bowl i gril fried rice
I almost lit my house on fire trying to make Craft microwave mac n cheese Yeah uhm I don’t wanna test my luck with that soup
You know, I like my fingers.
You should make a song about soup time!
my friend burnt ramen and used the same recipe for brownies to make blondies and cnat cook or bake
When you grew up in a house hold with an actual gormet cook as a parent: ... IF YOU DON'T ROLL UP YOUR GODDAMN SLEEVES, ILLY-!
I love pepper and green bean casserole, I would love your "mistake" casserole
From someone who lives in Serbia, Matzo ball soup is so damn nostalgic I cannot explain it.
Chicken and corn soup is better than chicken noodle soup, prove me wrong just go to a good Chinese/Chinese American restaurant, don't do those small take out places,they're good but my experiences was that the soup was much less tasty than the true one
3:43 HA! GAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY!
oh my gosh. When she mentioned maztoball soup, my jewish heart MELTED, like those delicious matzoballs. So glad people love it
Peppa 😏
2:35 HAIKYUU REFERENCE I SEE? edit: 4:38 JJK? edit againn: 5:09 ON THE FRIDGE TOO? edit 3 lmao: LMAOOOOO THE SIGN “grace field meat” and “uchiha tears” 💀

Me thats 11 years old and knowing how to cook rice and an egg:✨ *I m a p r o f e s s i o n a l c h e f* ✨
One time me and my dad were making some cinnamon sugar and butter on toast, simple, right? We didn’t have cinnamon sugar so we had to make it, you might know where this is going We used salt thinking it was sugar. So we called my mom to ask why it tasted so bad She said that the cinnamon sugar was behind the coffee pot and said that we ran out of sugar and that was the salt  My god the toast was bad
I've done the same thing with a peeler
Anyone else notice her cat Judy did the drum roll
The first time i cooked i was ten

I cut myself really bad with one of those horizontal vegetable peelers when I was a kid, and I've been traumatised by them ever since. So now I only use the vertical ones. *They've never hurt me*

Soup time soup time that should be my new ringtone
Illy!s scream when she turned on the stove 👌
you're a very good singer
can confirm that a good green bean casserole in the bees knees in the south
Something I grew up with was thefsa which started apparently because of my dads grandma and for some reason all of the girls get the recipe so they can make it which it’s only made for thanksgiving and Christmas Eve and Christmas and it’s gone by January or the end of December and if you live in Minnesota your lucky cuz you can buy it there and probably in Norway too because it’s Norwegian bread for however it’s spelled if it’s not spelled right, it’s been a tradition even before my grandma was born, I kinda expected it to be a lot older then that though and it’s the best and has always been my favorite to have around that time and it’s probably cuz we don’t have it daily or a lot even though technically you can make it whenever but it’s a holiday tradition so even I will make it around the holidays which it’s made in November
When i was 8 i already knew how to cook XD
Matzah Ball are Jewish food for Passover lol
I would love to help u cook besides I have a excellent taco salad recipe...if you want it😌😌

No one:  Me: *scrolling through the comments to see if anyone else noticed the Jujutsu Kaisen picture and the Todoroki and Mob Psycho fridge magnets*
I love when Ratatouille in the thumbnail trying your cooking almost throws up
well, if you have a *pan* , 2+ *eggs* , *butter* , and maybe some spices like *pepper* . You could make some scrambled eggs.  *(Oh, and a cup to mix the yolks in)*
The first time I tried cooking was in college. Me in 6th grade knowing how to cook and bake a lot of different things😗
*i Burnt my whole house down*
My mom makes homemade matzo balls and her own broth and it’s so comforting
I just love that Todoroki is on the fridge

I can’t wait for the apron to come! I’m getting one for my grandpa! He’s always been an amazing cook (his mom did own a bar and grill so he grew up in the kitchen so that makes sense) and he has so many aprons (all probably older than me) I can’t wait to see his reaction!!

As a person going into culinary school hearing a TABLESPOON of pepper made me hurt. I screamed
Soup super nasty

haha, i'm from Florida, with all those stupid floridian man memes, being too far south is sometimes a problems, besides all the other cons
When I was first learning to cook, I always mixed up teaspoon and tablespoon because the abbreviations are t and T. I had to ask EVERY time I cooked something!
NO PUNZ IN THE KITCHEN
“You are REMI. And you can SNIFF THINGS! And then you THROW IT IN DA POT!Why?zUhZaHzUh, zOuP!” Is the best thing ever, you can’t convince me otherwise.
One time when I was like 5 my mom let me cut some potatoes and i cut open like half my hand I'm fine now but it still hureted
I love green bean casserole
I ouch cut my the finger print of my pinkie finger I was cutting cheese and then slip it hurt

I love the apron
I remember cutting my thumb with a peeler too! I was about 13 and was home alone and had volenteered to make dinner. I was peeling the potatoes to make mashed potatoes when that happened. Some of my blood dripped on to the potatoes, but they were surprisingly yummy when my dad and I ate them. 15 year old me is still surprised the slightly bloody mashed potatoes still tasted good.
bruh i m 13 i known how to cook like a milion disher lol
Me at 11 already knowing to make ground beef tacos and hot dogs and more
She’s woman are you afraid of the stove still I do not want to brag but I thinkRamen noodles why are you afraid of the store
I love it so much
on time i had 1 and 1 half cup of oil to brownies on accident. and i really wanted brownies that day, also the last part of the title "but im trying" is sums up my life in 3 words
SKEET!!!
strange that i managed to make amazing scrambled eggs by watching "every way to cook an egg" by bon Appetit  and i was just 10!
The second you mentioned maztoh ball soup, I had flashbacks to all the Jewish holiday dinners I ever had.
I was peeling an Apple yesterday and i accidently hit my hands with the knife

INJURY TIME
I know some recipes by heart.
So.. i am italian and i have no idea fo what Matzo balls are, but they really sounds like Canederli, a traditional Sud Tirol dish. Is someone able to confirm this, or they are just similar?  Edit: google gave me the answer. They are similar , but Matzo balls are hebraic.  Nice
i made matzo ball soup one time and my family loved it!
You got lucky with the peeler, once I was peeling apples or something and I slices right through my nail, like 80% of it and blood, a lot for a finger cut
Ah, Jewish penicillin. A classic 👌🏼
Illymation's character looks like something from animal crossing
Literally me.
LoL I had a peeler too but for some reason i couldn't drop it. It got caught on my thumb and didn't come off. That makes alot of ouichie feeling. I still have my thumb tho so yay.
What did you do with the other hand 😟🔫
When I was young child I was really into baking videos here on YouTube so I know a bit about cooking and now I'm getting into cooking and I'm kinda good not very good but I have skills so when I'm not a not adult anymore I'll be fine... hopefully

Green bean casserole is SOOOOOO good
Hey illy are u Jewish because at one point I seemed like a Jewish mother
Onece I tried grean Bean casiral and I liket it.
My dad taught me how to cook when I was around 8 because he was tired of me waking him up to make me scrambled eggs. Then I was home alone a lot after school because my dad was a truck driver and my mom worked overnights, so I had to fend for myself for dinner lol. Now I know how to make a few basic dishes and enjoy cooking and learning new dishes to make (my parents are really great and I have a wonderful relationship with both of them, and I'm actually very grateful that they taught me to be so independent, so please don't bash them, because they were just trying to make ends meet)

illymation: “So if you enjoy having the fingers you were born with-“ Me: *Cuts off tip of thumb while cutting paper with some dull scissors* Also me: O h n o -
Love makes my food suck even more
One time I cut my finger while peeling and apple to make apple pie. It was not pleasant. :(
I love this videos.
Now I would really like some matzo balls
My Very Own Thought From Illymations: “As you can see, when I was visiting my grandma in China, she made this Chinese cuisine called rice dumplings. I ain’t kidding. She also made spring rolls, but I’ll get to the point later. When we got home, I decided to make rice dumplings as well. I went to the store and bought Pillsbury Biscuit Dough which was the Grands Flaky version. And you might be thinking, “So you wanna be like Lisa Nguyen, right? Haha!” YES, I WANNA BE LIKE HER! I rolled the dough and added rice and other toppings for the filling. I also placed mozzarella cheese slices so they won’t open up in the steamer, but it FAILED! It’s ok! I still liked it! I even added bitter gourd to it! Which was... actually good. Those are my thoughts, so please subscribe.”
1:01 soup time
I have had some good green bean casserole
here is how to make bakery-style muffins 1 cup flour 1/2 cup sugar 1 cup milk half a teaspoon salt strawberry and some salted cashews nuts on top of you don't want to make muffins you can use any dough for ex pizza dough or bread dough and but the strawberries inside and add some nuts ontop

I loved this but the only thing I remembered was that Haikyuu jacket from 2:33! And all of the other anime references haha! 😊
I remember I added 5 tablespoons of salt instead of 5 tablespoons sugar by accident when I was making cookies, yuck 🤢
I wish this existed during a culinary arts class I was in. I would've dropped this in the chat so much

I know that this might be too late for you to see, but I want to say for anyone who is reading this that the sharper knife the better. I mean sharp knives are easy to cut through food, and if you get a cut it heals easier because a duel knife introduces more trauma.
My cat is matching with the tail lol.

Matzah ball soup is the only good way to eat matzah that I know of. Otherwise matzah just tastes like cardboard. (Fun fact: My doggo jumped on my chest while I was writing this and I made a bunch of typos.)
I love love love love love her soup song😊 and her injury crime🤣 song me 😁
why is nobody talking about the hidden anime charecters AHAHAH
Green bean casserole is SO GOOD.  Also, knife tip I learned from Food Prep that changed my life: when using a knife to chop things, keep the curved part of the knife on the cutting board and use it kind of like a hinge.
Learn how to hold a knife, first step, AIM FOR THE HEART
“cuts off finger” woops
Why are there so many other YouTubers
Uh I’m good at cooking (At least when I was little my parents told me that) Also my dad was a chef so he taught me how to use tools at like 5 er 6 idk
One word: T O D O R O K I
I am so glad we have the same opinion on green bean casserole.
I am from a country where English is not the first language. So my sister once made a recipe and she confused bell pepper and pepper, so guess who made a dish with several 100 grams of spicy peppers (when there werent any normal peppers left she switched to madame jeanette peppers). Unfortunatly i wasnt able to see to taste it or see other people taste it :(
i am 9 and i can cook lol
You have friends?!?!?!?!??!?!?
illy : you want all the fingers you were born with!!!! Me: well actually-
frame 1:28 WHERE DID SHE GET THAT PEELER?!?!

Let's just say nobody in my house trust me cooking... I somehow when warming up a cinnamon roll made it catch fire in the microwave... yeah I'm not a good cook I don't even trust myself
I'm a really good cook I learned a lot from my grandmother
This reminds me of the time I was cutting watermelon and wasn’t really careful and the knife fell (it was a huge knife) And the knife fell right next to my foot  It easily could have caused a lot of pain
You should try no bake peanut and chocolate bars they are so good and simple to make all you need is chocolate chips penutbutter butter powdered surgar and grahmcrackers
6:59 I Laughed So Much My Tummy Exploded With Pain
GREEN BEAN CASSEROLE IS SO GOODDDDDD
My aunt ruined green bean casserole for me because for some reason my family loves to add mayonnaise to green bean casserole and normally you can't even taste it so I don't really mind but this time I aunt was making it into literally added two tubs of mayonnaise into it it was like you got green beans and dip them in mayonnaise and ate it it was so gross
We had a school project we had to do where we baked cookies I got stuck with three girls of which one was my friend. For the first day everything was ok one girl I’ll call bob didn’t show up and the other girl I’ll call Jen dropped a plate shattering it.  After another day bob still didn’t show up and this was the final day of cooking me and my friend I had in the group got everything prepared but then Jen added two times the amount of flour we needed so we ended up putting in double the ingredients to make it even out  That’s when bob came in she looked at the recipe and added triple the amount we needed after we cooked it our teacher taste tested the cookies.  She threw up when eating ours.  So I ended up flunking the class and I never cooked again.
Yo- Green bean casserole is HELLA GOOD Anyone who doesn't like it, is a demon
Me wondering why the hell she's peeling a potato: 👁️👄👁️

Recipe for people who are terrible at baking (one of the first things I made on my own):  Ingredients: 1 boxed cake mix, 1 standard can of pumpkin pie filling, and 1 cup of chocolate chips  Steps: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Throw the boxed cake mix and pumpkin pie filling in an electric mixer and mix until smooth. Add chocolate chips. Take a mini-muffin tin and spray it with cooking spray. Spoon the batter into the cups, not filling them more than 2/3 full. Bake mini-muffins for 10 minutes or until a toothpick inserted straight downward into one comes out without any liquid batter on it.  Optional step: defend them with your life because they go FAST
I agree!! green bean casserole is the BEST. i eat it all on thanksgiving dinner
As someone who is in the south, my mom always made green bean casserole for thanksgiving and Christmas.  And it is godly
Hey yesterday I put a corn dog in the microwave (I'm ten) and then I filled the house with smoke

I wish I can just make another of my own diy recipes, my cheese bagle,  2 grinds of s&p cream cheese and a chicken cutlet recipe (I call it a ChagleTM) is now more than old news, I feel more like making my own stew! (With a twist of my own ingredients.) So after this watching it in the middle of the night! This really made me hungry for food now and a spark of your creativity, have a good evening.

My dad is still teaching me how to cook and has been since I could remember stuff and I can’t even be legally left home alone and I enjoy it I can cook a piece of bacon and a grilled cheese and a tiny bite sized pancake still working on big ones tho
As a North Carolinian, my mom ALWAYS makes Green Bean Casserole XD
When your still ten and can already cook :/
Alfredo with broccoli is my favorite food!
Yes, yes, all hail green been casserole!
This inspired me to add pepper to my spaghettini
Why is she teaching us how to do things 😅
The first time I was making bread it turned out HORRIBLE. I used flour which was too heavy/dense and the bread was NOT EDIBLE. The outer layer was rock hard and it was impossible to cut it with a knife but the inside was super dense and still wet and slimy after long time of keeping it in the oven. So the moral of the story is: use the right type of flour or you’ll end up with a bread turtle (u know, really hard outside, wet inside and not edible)
I like green bean casserole I like vegetable in general
When she said Papa John’s I remembered I had some in my kitchen. It is now midnight
Bruh she doesn’t know how to use sharp knife I used it since I was 7 or 9 or 10
Chicken and dumplings. I want to learn to make that.
I mean I do like green beans and I do like casserole why not give it a try
How do you know what taxes taste like?
7:10 THINK ABOUT THE KIDS! 3 seconds ago *curses*
as a jew, we cook matzo ball soup every year for passover. and, though it may seem boring, it feels like a special package that we only get during a certain time. food can be beautiful, food can be wonderful, but most importantly, food can feel like home, and no matter what you're cooking, I think thats what matters most.
Green bean casserole is not my favorite if I had a choice I would not eat it but my grandma's is killer
A tip for those of you who mix up teaspoons and tablespoons often: start with the amount in teaspoons. You can always add more if you need to, but it’s hard to take some out once It’s in
Actually the reason is to so if you get any cuts it'll hurt less and it'll be easier to fix well if you don't have your hand completely severed
to-do list : - make motza balls soup
The complete soup time song: Soup time, soup time, bout to get a pot for some soup crimes, soup time soup time, veggies in my hand lookin, MIGHTY FINE!!! Soup time, soup time, gonna peel the potato and make some soup. (I will add more later, but just when I think of more lyrics)
I prepared spaghetti, made the sauce and loved it. Want some virtual sauce?
4:16 I want itadoris meatballs recipe 🧍‍♂️
When I grew up I used to eat “fish balls” and no stop thinking that it used to be made out of fish but now it’s made out of toufoo and has some mince in it it wasssss sooo gooood

Personally I like to add glue and pencils to my soups, gives it a very unique flavor
2:28 illy is a furry :O !!!!!1!11!!!!1!1!!1
Illy, I gotta say i used to be a TERRIBLE cook. Baking with my nana was my happy place, and the fact that the best I could make without her was a mystery blob was upsetting. But then I decided to make a toll house cookie recipe. I ruined it. But then i did it again. They were better. And then I just kept making cookies every once in a while, like basically once a month, and eventually they came out perfect every time. Now I don’t even need a recipe and I can just make them whenever people ask me to. It’s really nice to be able to make some thing that you’re good at even if it’s not the best thing in the world. The thing it has taught me though is to properly read recipes because that’s always what kills me every time. tablespoons and teaspoons are a nightmare. Now im an ok cook and baker, and i managed to make pretzel dogs like the ones at auntie anne’s and my god they were good.
yes!! I am not the only one who had that 1000 times in childhood (still a child)
Excuse me I did not know that green bean casserole was widely disliked. I love green bean casserole, it is absolutely amazing

Okay but what are y'all's irrational kitchen fears? I'll go first: Oven doors. I'm scared the springs will fail and the door will slam closed while I'm putting something in or taking something out

One time a recipe i was making writ one DESILITRE of BAKING POWDER (it was one teaspoon lol) Spoiler alert: i realized it before putting it in :D
4:36 squad photo on teh back B)
I have a knife sharpener so I think I'm good with the soap detergent that you were talking about
when my mom isn't home and im dying from hunger, i make scrambled eggs with mozzarella cheese and bacon crumbs!
Psh, I blew up a crock pot and lit the kitchen floor on fire.Get on my level
She's a jujutsu kaisen fan too
I was in a cooking class at 11 years old, and I remember I was the WORST, and when I say the worst I mean I was the WORST learner there... And now I hate cooking but I must do it ;;_;; (I'm 13 :'u)
Pap Jon- WAIT nO

so matzo ball soup is kinda like caldo de bolitas de masa
4:35   * j u j u t s u   k a i s e n   o p e n i n g   i n t e n s i f i e s  *
"I'm a bad cook."           Me, who can't even cook a simple hotdog properly: you dare challenge ME?
*B a k i n g   g l o v e s*
now i want matzo  ball soup 😫✋
I CAN MAKE EGGSSSSS
I'm watching this page at night and  now I'm really tired and hungry at around 6:42
1:40 that was literally me when I was little because I used the peeler for an orange and by the end of the day I no longer had a nail on my pinky 😬
1:14 I accidently paused and waited for the video to continue
me boiling potatoes for mashed potatoes: :) me burning myself from the hot water: Injury time... Injury time.... time to account for my cooking crimes... my new fave songs: soup time and injury time
Do your cats ever beg for food while you cook
MAKE MACSTICKS
2:07 dull knives also have much more jagged cuts and can cause much worse injury if you were to cut yourself Source scouts bsa
Do yourself a favor: MAKE A PIZZA BAGEL, IT'S SO GOOD
4:39 is that.. black clover?
almost tried it
I dropped a knife in my foot I didn’t hurt tho
im itlian so i saw the actual measuring for the green bean casserole and went "what :D"
If you teach me how to make the 🥘 when im older then i would have a new dish for when i become a cook hopefully
*peppa what are you doing in my soup*
3:39 just todoroki sitting on the wall
Lol dad only lets me put butter knifes in the dishwasher
I’m 7 and I cook for my mom and 2 brothers
Kind of remember the first 2 things i learned to cook, rice and beans
I actually made a similar mistake to you with the pepper but for me it was salt.   One day during the cooking part of my home economics class in 6th grade, I misread the recipe for a pasta sauce we were making and added way too much salt 🤣
9:23 illy do be turning into doraemon
that moment when you realize the vibe "soup time" will never be finished
When she said "like a cat" my cat was playing with my fingers
Hi haminations
I’m 8 though
This one time I was home alone and I was using a knife. I put too much pressure on the lemon and the knife slipped. It cut some of my skin.
I started cooking when I was 7 I can make a double Dekker chocolate cake
shipping will be easy bc i live in aus ao it shall be quick
1:13 Considering the videos she's done. She's probably used to this
I’m new to this channel and when I saw the thumbnail I was convinced this was like a show from Cartoon Network or the Disney Channel. But I was wrong and it’s actually reminds me of the YouTube channel like the oddonesout and Let Me Explain Studios
Why they selling Uchiha tears ;-;
Did you just swear-
OvO) Illy watch Jujutsu Kaisen toooooo!!!! YEAHHHHH!!!
Why is nobody asking if she's ok?
can we appreciate the background artist for a second for always putting little anime things in the background
3:01 I know how to hold a knife now *drops knife and cuts of foot*
I SWEAR TO GOD IM NOT LYING THERE WAS A GORDON RAMSAY AD RIGHT AFTER SHE MENTIONED THE GREEN BRAN CASSEROLE
I noticed you had the making fiends ingredients when you made the green bean casserole
Quoting Maaz... ‘yUcky wUcky’
This is my favorite video to watch during soup making
I love greenbeencasroal
Yum green been casarol
I was like 6 when i learnt how to use an oven, definitely the best cook in the house aside from my mum  My brothers have never bothered to learn how to make anything but pizza and my younger sister is 6 yet she knows how to turn on and off the stove             Also i find it interesting how i can cook lasagne and yet i still need auto correct to back me up 90% of the time cause i still can't quite spell propirly
Honestly in my opinion,green beans taste pretty good, I don’t get why people hate green beans
Kinda reminds me of Gingerpale's style of writing
Illymation : I didn’t cook anything until I was in college  Me: (being a second grader) WHAT I can cook and use a knife and I am only 8 years old
Hi

Maza ball sound  kinda like albondigas 🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽 I'm I right?
“Become the seasoning”  So I cook myself?
Who else saw the todoroki magnet on the refrigerator??
I too have grown up in the south, and I still CANNOT stand green bean casserole. However, I will always appreciate someone who puts the effort in for it. I just won't eat it.
And also I love alot of pepper on my green bean casserole

Okay, game changer: HOMEMADE MATZO BALLS! 1 cup Matzo meal 2 teaspoons baking powder  1 teaspoon salt (kosher salt is best, but table salt works fine) 3 eggs 1/4 cup water 2 tablespoons oil.  Mix together, refrigerate for 15 minutes and BOOM! Do you want guaranteed freshness in your Matzo balls? This is AMAZING!!! I make them every Friday!
my dad kinda gets cut on his fingers with a kife sometimes dont know how to spell a little

I love Motza Ball soup-
I WENT TO CUB SCOUTS I KNOW HOT TO USE KNIVES
I just made matzo ball soup for breakfast! Don't judge, I work at nights. If I'm eating it at 6 a.m., it's breakfast.   Anyways, dude. It's so good and warm and soft. I wish I made smaller balls which were smaller than golf balls!
ah uchiha tears my favorite spice also great job cooking Ily its really cool that you have a specialty dish you can cook :)
I just assumed everyone knew what green bean casserole was. That shits fire 🔥

Protip: You don't need to peel potatoes or carrots, just wash it
I'm a terrible cook mostly because I'm an eight-year-old child and I do not know how to cook
You're welcome
sinep
I can’t have onions, I actually feel like my mouth is on fire when ever I have onions-
Wait, if I double, triple check, how many times do I check? 3 or 5 times?
I did the exact same thing with... SALT.
well im 10 and i can cook
Steamed greenbeans are good if it's not caned
When I was little my mum cut her finger with a knife when washing it
Thanks! i hate illymation Maaz! not cause he's brown, look at that headshape, and the size of his body, and oh god the glasses.
The ball size rant is great.
The “ah” made me die  😂
but ike a 1/4 tablespoon of pepper shouldn't be too bad though for a whole casserole
Girl I'm from the south and I tell you, GREEN BEAN CASSEROLE IS THE BOMB
4:38 THE PHOTO IN THE BACKGROUND!!!!!!!(only weebs will understand)
I WILL HELP YOU COOK
green bean cassorole good
This is why I make sandwiches because they slap
Ah yes a Todoroki and Pikachu magnet and a painting on the wall with Fushiguro Nobara and Itadori and isle 9 has Uchiha tears and Gojo juice with some grace field meat but I bet you guys know what the grace field meat is made of ( ͡~ ͜ʖ ͡°) and I think there's a mob pin

Anyone else know the song from Hebrew School, "Put a pepper in the pot, stir it up, nice and hot"? Maybe that was the Peppa reference haha
Here's a quick and easy spaghetti recipe. You'll need: As much spaghetti as you want A pot A spoon or fork As much garlic as you  want A small pan 5-10 cherry tomatoes Olive oil Salt Parmesan cheese  1. Add salt and water to pot. Turn on some ice and let boil 2. Once boiling, add spaghetti. Let spaghetti cook. 3. Set pot aside and peel your garlic. Then crush or chop your garlic into a small pan. Then drizzle with olive oil. 4. Let garlic cook for no more than 1 minute. 5. Now you can strain your spaghetti, and pit on plate. 6. Drizzle on the garlic infused olive oil 7. Cut up 5-10 cherry tomatoes and pit on spaghetti. 8. Put basil on spaghetti. 9. Put parmesan cheese on spaghetti. 10. See if you like it or not.

FOOD IS FOOD! FOOD IS FOOD!!!
"you can add anything! *flips page*   papa jo- *wait, no* "
Quick tips: - In terms of salt, it is better to pour a too little amount of salt than a big amount of salt. - Never, EVER forget to try the food you're making - If you're making something that takes a while, dont sleep. My father had this problem and i remember waking up at 4:30 am because of a smell that made me cough pretty badly, it was something my father wass cooking too late and he slept while he was doing it, so yeah, check to be with enough energy and dont sleep while cooking. - Always check the recipe twice and the ingredients too. Something like this also happened to my father xd (he's a good cook btw). So  my dad was making something like fideua or paella, and he had to add soft pepper (non-spicy pepper) to make it eatable, he confused the soft pepper with the spicy pepper and i was somehow able to eat it xd (it wasnt that bad btw). - Use good cooking material, this is pretty important because if you use pans that when you cook an egg half egg gets sticked to the pan, thats whe you got to buy a new one - Make not so difficult stuff if you're starting, when you're startiong to cook please, do easy stuff like frying an egg or pasta, dont make risotto or something pretty difficult. - Put a timer for *everything* - Put some effort... do i really got to say why? - Dont change anything if you dont know what you're doing, this is important to not ruin anything - Do everything at its time, this goes with the dont change anything if you dont know what you're doing, if you change time to for example how much time you have to cook for it to not be raw and not burnt, just dont change it - Be at what you have to be, dont distract and you will avoid a *d i s a s t e r*   Thats it for the moment, tell me if you got some other tips. Also, if someone was wondering it, im 13... just if i knew too much about cooking xd
You can make glue cookies atleast and those are nice
I can't believe I hurt myself with a butterknife
I've slammed a knife into my hand before. Cutting an onion & the knife slipped & did an arc and slammed into my middle finger on my left hand. It was April 1st.. Almost lost the first knuckle of my finger, but i had a smiley face of stitches on it..so that was fun putting eyes on. lol
:O   such a good singer!
After Watching This Video I Accidently Cut Off My Hand  LOL
Peppa what do you doing in my soup 6:17 xd
No se ni papa lo que dice :D
Bruh im 12 and i can cook well
Since you have 00.1 brain cells while making food like me I would recommend a air fryer because its like a oven but stupid easy to use when you read the manual-
2:36 karasuno
When you had mentioned “trials and tribulations” I had instantly thought of Phoenix Wright, is it just my imagination or was this another anime reference?
That one person with an extra finger 👁👄👁
Matza ball soup is a staple in any Jewish household. However, I will say, softball sized matza balls were the best and my grandmother always made them extra large during passover. But they do take FOREVER due to size. But 10/10 eat matza ball soup
So cookies are my matzo ball soup... neat 😁
Ayao job owns and a lot of people in a row in this is not is a ton pan sisnsjjsnsns
I don't know if u added this but another thing you need to be aware of in the kitchen is multitasking and if you can't do that..... say goodbye to the kitchen cause its going up in flames lol (no not really) but just make sure to check on things if ur waiting for something to cook
yes yes illy good cook yes yes
Maaza bowl Hahahahahha
Gf and I get Hello fresh.  3 meals a week.  It's honestly great.  also there's plenty of budget knife sharpeners out there. But I'd avoid one of those cheap countertop ones you can get anywhere.  I'd suggest spending at least 30 or 40 dollars on a good one.  Like the Lansky diamond ceramic turn box on amazon for 29.88 or the Lansky Sharpening Tool Universal 4 stone system for 36.98
me answering the intro: yes also me: *a child*
I was using a safety appliaince  for cutting and me and my father cut of the tip of our fingers not too serious but there was blood everywhere
6:20 keep her in there
2:30 illymation da furry :>
My brother did the same pepper thing but with muffins and he did it with SALT
I’m actually making tacos as I watch this
Green bean casserole yucky lucky 🤣
no and no
Papa John’s oh wait
I bought the Matzo balls kit!!! I'm making it now!
*I can relate*
Cheesy green beans is very similar to your green bean casserole. It is at almost every gathering my family has so yeah, everyone who enjoys potato chips enjoys it, except me, who HATES potato chips, doesn't eat it.
I love matzah ball soup ❤️
Me: Cooks mac and cheese at 9 years old Also me:Spills everything
You and I are not so Different
SOUP TIME, SOUP TIME :D
Did I see a haikyuu jacket on that one animated gurrlllllllll😏
Alright, time to be misogynistic as possible  How can an intelligent, creative, funny, all round amazing woman such as yourself not be able to cook.   It's not like it defines as a woman you can learn how to cook on youtube later on.   And don't get me started on how lucky your husband is gonna be.
3:01 *Drops knife on foot*
I love matzo ball soup!!! It's so good
It's nice to see the sugar and spice and the chemical x in the background. 😆
Illy: “Don’t get your pepper proportions mixed up.”  Me: “Don’t get your flour and powdered sugar mixed up.”
Just imagine, mozzarella soup with garlic smeared crab and alfredo sauce- now I'm hungery. Oof
OK my mom's green bean casserole was one of my favorite dishes growing up, the key is limited cream of mushroom. It is nice to meet another green bean casserole fan
It's weird. I love green beans but I can't stand green bean casserole
I once was making shortbread and spilled the salt container. Dont ask how.
I know how to use a knife now *proceeds to drop the knife*
Once I got cut and the entire day I didn't care
"Soup time, gonna get a pot and make some soup crimes!" With that terrible cooking that will
My moms green bean casserole was probably my favorite part of thanksgiving. So dam good!
Pitition for illy to release a cookbook
7:10 and 7:11 god lol geez no mad pls
I did the same with a potato peeler
Im am
Fun fact: this video reminded my mom of matzoh ball soup so she decided to make it one night, the soup turned out so good that I decided to pack it in a flask (thermos) for school the next day. So the next day at school I'm having some of the soup and I felt something in my mouth, I spat it out and it turned out to be a piece of glass, I looked in the flask and saw a lot more broken glass, (turns out that the one I had was an older one that had a glass inner lining, which must have broken), I got sent home to have my health monitored and I turned out fine, luckily the glass hadn't done anything to my insides. (this all happened yesterday, and I'm fine)
**Don't play with knives.*
in ur school food video u talked about Mac sticks why don't u try making some of those?
0:08 i was 7 and it was not scary i guess its because i want to be a cook
I literally cheese grated myself a week ago.
The apron is toooo temptin, it has fucking pockets, i gotta fucking but that thing
**Literally every kid who can fry rice , cook, and bake**
I love how detailed your videos are!!
My mom makes THE BEST matzah ball soup
i live in tennessee and i also love green been casarole, sweet potato casarole, and broclli casarole.
HAIKYUU AND MY HERO ACADEMIA REFERENCE ALSO THE OTHER ANIME GUY WITH THE PINK HAIR HOLY CRAP AND TPN
Ha Ha...  Pain. Just pain.
That rice and what I believe is a bunch of vegetables looks like something my grandma would make, I’m not being ironic, I know my grandparents eat that from time to time, I miss going to their house every day, ironically we live like 1 minute away and I can always walk to their house, but the minute isn’t on foot, and we live in the mountains of Guaynabo so it’s kind off a long walk
Gordon Ramsay said that he feels like he is in heaven when he eats McDonald’s
Maaz always is the one who is like "EWW" in theese animations
One time i added a *tablespoon* of baking soda. Least to say it was unedible
MY STOVE MAKES A TICKING NOISE THAT SOUNDS LIKE A BOMB AND I THINK ITLL BLOW UP LIKE THAT WOODY WOODCHUCK MOVIE WHENEVER I MAKE MAC N CHEESE
Oh and also, if you put your hand at the blade, it’ll cut your hand easily if you cutting something hard to cut
illy:  you can pretty much put aNything in the soup: me: *mom are we all out of frozen waffles-*
why is no one talking about "wam bam crisp as ham" its too iconic to not be talked about
i want the full version of soup time
I can't lie when I saw peppa i was like NOOO DON'T CUT PEPPA UP an then i noticed it was a joke..
i love having matza ball soup every passover. it's like the only good thing that week. matza usually tastes like cardboard, but matza ball soup doesn't. it's available all year at the stores, but it's more special during passover.
2:36 ara ara~i see 👀 an ics haikyuu jacket 4:14 ahh yuji itadori 4:38 megumi, itadori and kugisaki 4:53 todoroki 5:16 pikachu So much anime @~@
I mean, she’s not wrong. Those are some funny aprons.
Peppaaa what r u doing in an illymation video?
me who is in the 7th grade and never got cut in the kitchen
once i was making orange juice but instead of orange  we picked a grape fruit (NOT ON PURPOSE) and it taste DISGUSTING
If you look closely you can see the tablespoon turn to teaspoon in 2 sec
Green bean casserole 😋
i love ur channel so much
wait is illy a furry?
Don't feel to bad. I to have peeled my finger with a vegetable slicer.
S O U P  T I M E
4:23 NOOO! Now you got me thinking about that sad Juju stroll when Fushiguro made his meatballs and they all just sat around the table feeling depressed that Itadori was gone.. but at least he's back now. Despite this Ted Talk of a comment, nice reference. I'm going to see myself out now.
Why do you say broth like that
It's interesting when I meet people whose parents never taught them how to cook or do like, laundry. My mom started teaching me how to cook starting at like age 14. You don't need to be an expert at first, just add onto what you know little at a time as you grow older. It makes things easier especially these days when I don't want to go out.
I was not expecting Peppa to be in her soup
Make a makstick!
6:16 *Idaho loads an AK47*

Illy: EATS PEPPA
I learned this when I was 6
Thank you so much, I have a fear of cooking and messing up and your video just calmed me down and made me wanna cook more.
I spent lockdown last year doing 3 things. 1. Writing a book 2. Finally cleaning bedroom properly in 5 years and 3. Perfecting my pizza recipe. The main thing is cooking the base all the way through BEFORE you add sauce and toppings because it won't cook after you add toppings. Also when making the sauce use a spoon to get the herbs out don't just eye ball it I cannot count how many times i made that mistake. And finally prick the base before cooking. There is yeast which is a raising agent if you don't your base will puff up in random spots and you feel awful. It's very important
You’re a cinnamon bun
2:36 is it just me or is that a karasuno jacket
I can't believe I'm laughing about Illy saying that the balls shouldn't be big
6:19  Lyrics: *gasp* Peppa, what are you doing in my soup?:D
Me throughout the whole video:  “FUSHIGURO!”  “ITADORI!!!”  “NOBARA!!”  “IS THAT MOB?!”  “SHOTO”  That’s all😀
I only know who to cook some instant noodles and bacon lol
I couldn’t stop laughing at the peepa joke
peppa what are  you doing in my soup
The sad thing is I cut baby carrots with a butcher knife i and still have all my fingers...I’m 10 •.•
No i dont
SoupTime song is a banger
OMG I love matzo ball soup it's so good I grew up eating it and I still eat it to this day
I rember watching this and when it came to motzo balls scence my dad just came in the room and just gave me that face
I thought that matzo balls were matzerella balls sorry if I spelt it wrong
UCHIHA TEARS AND GRACE FIELD MEAT LMAOOOOOOOOO
Monster balls are good🤤
Please
Please can you make a video with the odds one out
My favorite food in college was bacon wrapped hotdogs
She really like those kneidalah
3:39   I see a todoroki smh
Wow
Cooking is a struggle lol, I've been really into Korean food lately and wanted to try making Doenjang Jjigae (Korean soybean paste stew) but it didn't turn out quite right, I forgot to get knobufor the broth and I used too much water, my zuchinni was overcook and mushy and I'd bought soft tofu instead of firm so it just disintegrated into the soup, it was a bit of a mess overall, however I did have fun making it despite the outcome and I'm still proud of myself for trying somthing new :)
How to solve the dull knife problem : GET A KNIFE SHARPENERR
I can just literally know how to cook eggs
1:13 "oh no, I peeled the wrong potato"
Me at 10: *cooking omelettes home alone*  Me at 17: *using a fork to take toast out of a toaster*
What’s in that matzo ball seasoning? I want to see peppa pig melt into the cosmos in my bowl of soup.
Yep , he knows how sing it
In 2:10 you can feel Illy's hand growing. I mean the one in the floor. It will grow in to an evil version of Illy with a moustache. This could be a awesome origin story. The reason? The magic of animation.
;-;
I can make simple dishes. But I can't fry a fish. It makes me sad
6:19 PEPPA what are you doing?
Soup time soup crime
The amount of people who are going to buy funny aprons and use 2 times then hang it on there wall
WAIT HOLD ON PLEASE MAKE COLD SOBA 😭
DID YOU GET BISCUT BACK
1 love u illy
5:03 Did anyone else noticed the todoroki fridge magnet
GOD I remember Me, my mom, and my brother would eat matza ball soup ALL THE TIME because we were loser vegetarians who couldn't eat the fish balls
Let’s list the food I can make -Ramen Yeah.
illy is a much better animator than TheOdd1sOut, way underrated.
Its makin me hungry😂😂😂
The background music make me uncomfortable 😣
Are we alllll going to ignore the fact the she has todoroki on her fridge on her fricken fridge oh my gawd yes
Green bean casserole was the bomb! 🤤🤤🤤
I remember i was seven i kill a rat with the knife and it was fun
How do you mess up making milk tea!?!
I can not cook I boiled a potato and thought it would cook but no I just ate a warm raw potato
=)
Matzoballs soup really looks like romanian supa de galuste. Look it up 😋
Major kudos for using a mirepoix for your matzo soup. It's a combination of carrots, onion and celery used for soups and stews
This was the most relatable video ever.
oye
ah eys i would liek some   U C H I H A T E A R S  in my soup yes please
I made my first dish on thanksgiving 2020 CUPCAKES                 Why Are You Still Going?!                   At age 8...
I hated my ring finger
"Anyone can cook, it doesn't mean they should." - Remy
I put one table spoon of pepper into my moms wired cake and it was really gross because of that
I tried making Deviled eggs for the first time and I was reading a recipe online I thought it was 2 tablespoons salt and a tablespoon white vinegar....... 12 eggs went in the trash that day
I can agree with the mostaball soup
i’m not a good cook, but i once made this one meal, let me explain it. chicken, wrapped in parma ham, stuffed with mozzarella, with i side of mash, now it’s mash out of the box, it’s some homemade mashed potatoes. and i liked it it was pretty good
I grew up in the midwest we make are greenbeen carsarol we use tater tots as a topping instead of onions ITS DA BOMB
BIG MOTSO BALLS!
Soup tiiiiiiimmmmmmmeeeeeeee
6:00 Me:ok lets see here ill put some milk with some 1 month old bread and some year old gum Also me: hey thats pretty good My doctor: im sry sir but you will die of food poisening Me: illy you lied to me
Galusca
Can we appreciate the Shoto on the frige please ? 5:10
She said the name of the GAME!
funny thing after this video came out I kinda forgot this part 1:11 .I was peeling a apple and I cut my finger .So yeah lesson learned ps make sure you don’t do what I did and be safe also awesome video
Can't believe Illy forgot the golden rule of seasoning. You can always add but you can't take.
Don’t put potatoes in soup
hii
A hahaha rattatilly
Why u using a chefs knife for an apple. JESUS like everyone knows you use a pairing knife 😌🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱😩🤧🤧🤧😇😇😇   Just kidding I love you illy 😂💖
I know right l feel scared when am cooking
DID ANYONE ELSE NOTICE THAT SHE HAD THE INGREDENCE FOR THE POWER PUFF GIRLS ON THE COUNTAER? HOW CAN YOU NOT LOVE THIS VIDEO HOW CAN YOU NOT LOVE THIS ANIMATOR! HOW! HOW SWAY!?!?! UGHHHHH! I re watch this video all the time! I love it sooo much!
i like green beans
So motzoballs are just tofu?
So, for some weird reason, all your talk about Matzo Ball soup is making me want meatballs, for like meatball subs? Even tho Matzo ball soup seems to be closer to chicken n dumplings
I for one am fortunate because my mother taught me how to cook
Had to learn to cook at a youngish age cause my mom wouldnt stop feeding me foods i had sensitivities to lmao
That's why I wasn't getting sub notifications for illymations in over a year, YouTube unsubbed me from it
Miss Ilyssa I really love and I want to give an art when its ready Soo how do I do it
When there is no description: *thats rare*
...How have I never seen any of your videos before? XD You're really relatable... EDIT: Matza Ball soup? Never had it before
I almost cut my pinkie off
Sees the mats a balls has eggs: *sad noises*
I ate Mack sticks
Luigi if you know what's good for you *don't come in the kitchen*
That one time that I cut myself cutting it Keewee
We need more youtuber animators like you
2:29 I didn't know illymations is a fury🤔
זה קניידלך
love it <3
Mm i love green bean casserole
Im just commenting to get the number to 6969

3:48 I came from the border of the north, and I prefer chicken fried steak.
the jjk trio in the background @ 4:39 💗
:D I was watching this video but then I saw the Todoroki fridge magnet and I was like " :O HOW COME I NEVER NOTICED THAT?"
That was good singing though.
anime references mob phsyco 100  fmab mha jujutsu kaisen pokemon
hello Animalmon army!
We will have a soup-time, they said, it will be funny, they said
U should totally do a sibling vid cuz u have only talked about ur bro once in the fast food playground video
First vid I watched from u :)
I LOVE MATZO BALL SOUP TOO OMGGGG😍😄✨ My family ate is at Passover (a Jewish holiday) a couple weeks ago it's so good >:)))
I am a good cooker I can help u
I tried matzo ball soup cause of this. I added some carrots which complimented the seasoning really well.
*todoroki chilling on the fridge*
This feels kinda weird to me cause I actually learned how to cook at a young age (before I was allowed to). How? Experimenting as a kid.... a LOT.
I'M HERE FOR THE CHAOS
I'm always looking for the MHA references
Tax food
Yucky wucky is my reaction to 😆
Wait did I just see a Shinso flying across the screen 👁👄👁
No, I want to he part of the missing fingers club!
I can help out my dad to make... FETTUCCINE WITH ALFREDO SAUCE
I was 10yrs old and I was not afraid of cooking
Illy this was better than my actual culinary class
Plot twist :you try to use the knife and cut your hole hand
Same but im only 8
I love it when she said peppa what u doing in my soup
Who else thought this was going to be sponsored by Hello Fresh
PEPPA !? W h A T  aRe Y O u D o I N g in M y S O u P
This video was posted on Elton johns birthday
I paused to comment something but then noticed my favorite trio at 4:36
1:26 U^U dont worry illy! ive been using knives and cooking since i was 7! :> i have plenty of expirence
Eh I kinda agree with Maz and live in Alabama and still don't like green bean casserole.
I DIED AT THE GRACE FEILD MEAT AT 5:53 uihdhgfuhgfgfuregfy
“Are you old enough to not be afraid of turning on the stove but still are for some reason” Me: *sniff* finally the question for me 🥲
Peppaaaaaa what are you doing in my soup
I have a pepper story only it was salt. Yeah I blame the teeny text and that teaspoon and tablespoon look the same
This is seriously Illys best video. Production wise.
The Best dish i ever made was spaghetti with my special sauce the soaghetti is easy but the sauce is a bit harder it has only 3 ingrediensts it has to be in order tho it should look like a mix with Red and orange
Shout out to y'all who eat Matzo ball soup on Passover!
Mushroom soup is bettah XD
Ur so awesome illymations and funny and creative
I just discovered this channel And the animation is just like Jaiden Animations and theodd1out combined
I cook at age of 10 and i am angry that im responsible for the cooking every time I help my mom a lot but I can't train  cooking because they are scared of me burning the house
Pepper pig is 7 feet 1 inch
4:44
"Gonna get a pot for some soup crimes" IDK why but that like KILLS me no matter how many times I listen to it
AYOOOOOOO I REMEMBER HER WHEN SHE WAS JUST STARTED ANIMATIONS
4:14 4:35 Jujutsu.....           Kaisen (illy, thank u illy 4 doing dat)
The tablespoon changing to teaspoon is a real thing I swear!!!! I'm always messing up the recipe or taking 5x as long making sure and going back several times to be 100% sure I read it correctly
This was sweet
*MAC STICKS*
This is why cooks don't measure. We geuss bc we just know. A 1/4 teaspoon is about 2 pinches. A table spoon is the confy piel in ur hand. That's all u need to know. And if it looks like too much. If I seems like too much. IT'S TOO MUCH. Tem you can always add. But never subtract
I gotta say, in terms of ANIMATION this is the best storytime channel out there. I love how everything’s colorful, the aesthetic of the backgrounds, and how just LIVELY the character animation is. I mean, seriously—there’s blinking and lip-synch!  I super appreciate the work Illy and her team put into these quality animations ^^
“and I know what you’re thinking” “EW—” NO. GREEN BEEN CASSEROLE IS THE BEST
Good cook
I LOVE GREENBEAN CASSAROLE :D     Its one of my favorite foods :)
Illy going crazy over motza balls (no clue how you spell it) gives me life
1:00 S O U P  M A M A (if you watch footofaferet you know)
"You want all of your fingers right" me ya but I want scars😉😉
The lil soup time song tho
At 0:08 that those are sugar, sage, and a beaker with an X on it...  Me: Sugar, spice, and chemical X. Where's the "everything nice," tho? Hmmmmmmm... Me: [Illy's right there] Me: *GASP* The "everything nice" is Illy!
My cousin would eat all your Green Bean Casserole, he is crazy about pepper
my dad was a head chief for most of his life but sadly he died before he could really teach me, but I like like to think he's watching over me while I cook and shaking he's head as I recklessly chuck way to much chilli in, ether way my sister did a cooking course and is an amazing chief so if im unsure I can always ask her
4:38 jujutsu kaisen in the background, earned my sub
You're an amazing person Ilyssa!
Can we get a link to the chill soup music? I wanna put that on and disconnect
I once used a pealer and pealed my nail off
peeling a kiwi is hell.
I’m from South Carolina and this video hits
I'll be that guy and just say Moe's > Chipotle
thanks illimation thanks to you i can learn english  Saludos desde México y muchas gracias
Am i the only one who decided being a cook cause of ratatouille and food wars
The sketti flag, i-
I love how she has haiykuu memes randomly in the video
Isn't it ironic that wen I was 10 I cut myself with a potato peeler by accident and uhh I still have the scar haha I got it glued back on SO I RELATE TO YOU LILYMATIONS
Southern style mac and cheese>green bean casserole. Sorry illy. And yes ITS A VEGETABLE
When illymation  uploads  :O
Illy:THINK OF THE CHILDREN, PLEASE!       Illy: and then they FLOAT
4:55 BRO todoroki is on the FRIDGE I-
Did any one noticed the jujitsu kaisen painting
Omg i love her already
My mom is literally a 3 star chef 👩‍🍳  And my cooking is literally SH*T
I know how to cook but I relate very strongly to that "afraid to turn on the stove" bit. I try to avoid open-flame cooking methods as much as I can XD
green bean cassarole is da bomb
When max said yucky wucky I actully cried
That cat part remembered me miitopia
Why is soup time such a good song 😂
Another reason to keep your knives sharp: if you cut yourself on a dull &/or jagged knife, instead of just slicing your skin, you can end up tearing your skin off!!! So take care of your knives!!
👀okay pot bed sheets😂❤️
me watching thise in ramadan *sad aku noises*
When my dad and I made bread pudding, we would put cinnamon in until we were certain it was ruined. And then it was somehow delicious! Until the time it wasn't... 😅
I like the Haikyuu reference.
My sister tryed to make green bean casserole but it was so bad that not even the gout would eat it
i did that too
The soup time song is actually catchy
Can we get a part two to the teacher thing I really want to know the other kids
Atleast you haven't burnt  a tomato.
Dude.. green bean casserole is the bomb!!! I thought it would be gross too but now it's a staple Thanksgiving side!  My mom also got me into Matza ball soup! It's awesome!  Also my wife probably would have liked your green bean casserole. I don't know how she doesn't choke on all the pepper she puts in her food o.o
your not the only one who's bad at cooking I tried to make toast yesterday and almost the  house on fire-
But was the food bussin?
Hello I am Doh not speak english
I got something worse on a broken door handle
4:35 The picture of Itadori, Nobara and Megumi looks damn good
Peppa what are you doing in my soup 6:17
It’s called bear claw
I just saw this and now I belive in my self to make my own food
I tried cooking a ready made soup awhile but I still failed it. 🤷
Lesson of the video: mess up your food during potlucks so people don't eat it and you don't have to give any effort.
For some reason my stove Turner-onner-thingies are super loose, and I bumbed it while walking past and almost got set on fire...   .
GREEN BEAN CASAROL IS GOOD TO YOU IV HAD IT BY MY GRANDMA AND IT IS GROSE
5:50 "Grace Field Meat"
I’ve never even heard of matzo ball soup. 😲 I NEED to search! Thanks! ❤️

5:03 SHE HAS A TODOROKI PIN ON HER FRIDGE
I don't think dish washers should be called dishwashers because the technical don't wash the dishes
In my country the name for this soup it:Supa de galuste
Illy about to cause another wild fire spanning a country
Can you make a video on adventure time !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!please!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Yo why is NO ONE talking about 7:51?? Excuse me? What did my eyes spot? THE TRIOOO
I'm about to drop an wonderful piece of culinary knowledge.  The concept of Mise En Place means everything in it's place.  Before you start cooking make sure you have all of your ingredients prepped.  This is the best way to keep things from burning because you can avoid taking your eyes off of your food.
I like you videos, and character drawing, animation!
Why don't you put fan art in your videos
I was making french toast a few weeks ago and added a 1/4 tablespoon of nutmeg instead of a 1/4 teaspoon. The nutmeg was strong as fuck but still edible xD
Illy we need to see your animal crossing new horizons town!!!! we gotta know if you got biskitttt
I love  her video 5hey are the best👍👍👍
Green bean casserole is the bomb!!!❣️ I grew up with it as a kid and I will forever love it❣️❣️ I was only able to ever eat it during get-togethers or Thanksgiving but I would love to eat it every day🥰😍
me: im not a good kidnapper but I'm trying  cops: he-WAIT
Remy: anyone can cook Also Remy: just because anyone can doesn't mean anyone should  (But pls keep cooking is guud)
Peep that karasuno volleyball jacket from Haikyuu

*No Maaz’s were harmed in the making of this video*
Okay but that soap song slapped.. until you hurt yourself.
No I purposely stabbed myself because I wanted to know what would happen 😐
my  siblings made it a joke that i can't cook/bake
Haminations hi
What’s with YouTube animators and doing Ted talks?
What’s up guys yep,.....
You should make a video about childhood trauma
Green bean casserole taste really good actually
I always burn eggs
I'm adoring all the jujutsu kaisen references
I make them teniiss ball size or a little smaller  and it is super good
She said “Go on git!” XD
i do want all 4 of lovley cartoon fingers
Nobody :   Illy :     *Peppa what are you doing in my soup?*
Feels like an actual cartoon airing in nickelodeon
I think matzo balls are like Kneidalach, A Jewish dish that sounds similar to me
i can't eat beans and i almost die when i was baby
I added cookies, since those taste good. Wasn't that bad.
i was eat ice cream watching this
I might legitimately need one of those aprons I love cooking
How come it doesnt say ft aMAZZing

Hiii illy I saw a Tim Tom video we’re you had to eat a pepper and then you brought snaks
4:04 LOOK AT THAT BEAUTIFUL ONION!
Okay I have a CRAZY story like the pepper one so for ST. Patrick's day my brother wanted to make fudge and the fudge called for TWO TEASPOONS OF RUM but SOMEHOW my brother read it wrong and added HALF A FLIPING CUP OF RUM!!!! Let's just say my family never ate to much in one setting XD
peppa 6:19
We both love the same soop
You know what u said about your fingers...
One time I was peeling potatoes and I accidentally peeling a tiny bit if my skin off. I still have a small scar to this day.

Illy. And... Hulu commercial: sOmEbOdY aTe My DoNuTs!1
When Illy said "You want all of your fingers to stay on your hand right" I thought to myself NO! and laughed at myself...   *This is what my life has come to...*
Thanks for the talk, I'm 15 and still scared to even use a microwave... I wanted to learn and saw this and it helped a lot. Again tysm ☺
3:40 my thoughts exactly
My mom made cookies, but then I tried with my sister, USING THE SAME RECIPE but our cookies ended as one big cookie. Edit cuz I forgot: I wanna try your spaghetti I love spaghetti
1:50 One of the times I've regretted being able to visualize PG things in non-PG detail.
5:50 naruto refrence, jujutsu kaisen and the promised neverland
I’d rather put crushed up ritz instead of fries onions it gives it a buttery taste.
I’m now hungry....
you jewish?
POV: You keep rewinding the soup time song over and over because it's golden.
19:19👁👄👁
I recently made cupcakes for my family and I made a buttercream frosting to go on them. But instead of using powdered sugar, I used regular sugar. That was a mistake that I realized as soon as I put it in, but I decided it was past the point of no return. So I put in powdered sugar too and then mixed it up. It still tasted good, so it wasn't a huge loss.
The anime references. Love them! *chef's kiss*
Please post Soup Time on Spotify 😂😂
anyone see this reference 4:37

I wish I animated like you, I was so proud of myself but when I opened YouTube, I saw how good ppl really are
I demand an Illy rat with chef hat!
6:18 I laugh at this part every time idk y
Little tip for seasoning, always put salt and pepper to taste. It'll turn out much better. (this does not apply to baking, which requires exact measurments of salt :P)
I suck at cooking as well
Wham bam crisp as ham.
I learned to cook at an early age so I dont gotta worry abt this but I still love rewatching this
I can cook but I don't usually cuz it always takes too long. I either just boil a bunch of pasta that I put in the freeze to heat up antoher day or I don't eat any proper dinner at all. I'm someone who gets tired easily and eating an unhealthy diet does not help with that. I've taken to heating up some tuna with my pasta when I realised I hadn't any proper protein in a week. Sometimes I heat up peas to be my green veg but usually I survive on eating raw peppers like apples for vegetables. My point is learning to cook is extremely important especially if you don't have a weird fatigue disorder like me.
i havent seen your channel in a while and youve come so far eeeee!
ILLY YOU ARE SO FUNNY I HAVENT LAUGHED THIS MUCH IN YEARS 😭😭😭😭 also your animation is amazing!!!
I like green beans and I’m up In the north lol!
2:16 is that a haikyuu jacket omg qwq !!!!
Yeah cooking is a skill that I somewhat have but I'm slow af at prepping ingredients
I can only cutely Cook pasta noodles and macaroni
WAIT OMG THE PEPPA JOKE THAT WAS LIKE A YEAR AGO
Einfach Grießklößchensuppe oder was
Your upload  schedule is good
Me  too  i hurt  my  self  with  the  pealer my  nail  and  skin 😨
I think she might like Jujutsu kaisen...
Interesting.... soup with an apple
Is that todoroki sticker on her fringe?
Cooking oils suck... - Sun tzu
*hmm feels like taxes*
As someone who also grew up with matzo ball soup I personally feel that the 2 most important things are the broth and the size of the matzo balls. If the broth is bland then literally everything is bland and it is a bad experience. If the matzo balls are too big IT IS A BAD TIME A VERY BAD TIME  The absolute best matzo ball soup I ever had had tiny matzo balls about 1 inch across with made-from-scratch broth that was just a punch of flavor (in the best, soupy way possible)
i am ten years old and i cook just fine
When I was 10 I loved to cook I still do tho
BYE CUZ I REALLY GREW UP WATCHING YOUR VIDEOS 😭😭
7:59 i watched the musical XD
Huh peppa what are you doing in my soup
Idk if anyone else said any comments about this, but MATZO BALL SOUP IS THE BEST!!! Please take illymation's advice guys. It's the best :))
Sorry what was in my food 6:55
A pan shrimp salt pepper put the shrimp in a bowl of water put oil (not car oil😂) put the shrimp in the pan oh also heat the pan before you add the shrimp the shrimp will start to look like this 🍤 a little brown but not to much take it out of the pan into a plate ketchup and barbecue and you are a chef
Lol you don't know how to cook while I can make a  western barbecue set and I am not careful with very sharp knifes at a young age( No offense)
I can’t explain how happy I get when I cook
Green bean cassorole be bangin tho
Am i the only who saw the jusutu kasien picture- 7:50
5:45 sans would be mad
Me questioning if I want all my fingers
6:19 pepa
No no no no
Why does soup time sound so familiar
Dude do you know how to cook rice,egg and cook chicken because im still young i know how to cook those things
Meanwhile me with my crappy diet just watching for no reason:
When is soup time on spotify?!?!?
As a Uni student living alone.  Nothing makes me feel more at home than some mack & cheese with some chicken. Simple, easy on the belly, and good af.
I see that though have a little Todoroki head on your animated fridge It is so good to find another person who likes mha/bnha I really like Denki and my sister likes Fumikage  Do you also watch Haikyuu?
OOh how I love Uchiha tears

Me watching this video even though I am the one cooking dinner at home: 👁️👄👁️
What if I don’t have hands... 1:17
Cooking tip: flatten your ingredients before cuting ingredients to fly away because they think you're cuting skills are poor
If you dare scratch the non-stick pan with metal I WILL KICK YO ASS  Edit: if you dare to use a saucepan to cook fried rice I hear the rice sizzling I hear my ancestors crying Don't do it
Illy the Rat going “IzZzizziZIZiAa SOUP!” is definitely blurssed.
Green bean casserole is good!
Heyyy I saw todoroki on your fridge I see how you try to sneak anime into videos but continue LOL
Peps on x games mode
Love the Jujutsu Kaisen pic
"peppa- what are you doing in my soup?" -illy mation 2021

Halarious!!
Roar
soup time lyrics:   soup time  soup time bout to get a pot for some  soup crimes  soup time soup time veggies in my hand lookin MIGHTY FINE soup time, soup time, gonna peel the potato- (oh woops)    pt.2:  injury time injury time time to account for my cooking crimes
Next time I make soup, I'm not gonna be able to do it without singing that song.
I’m going to memorise the soup time song
Wanna help Illymation with her soup crimes?
That’s what she said
but ... Illy Mart supports cannibalism...
you are so talented and deserve more attention. you should watch odd1sout. he is funny.
I relate to this video on so many levels. I love  green bean  casserole.
ISTG THE PEPPER TABLESPOON/ TEASPOON IS SO ACCURATE!!
here something it still food if you can eat it and never waste food think about rice people work hard to make rice for you and for you to make and eat to fill that tummy but not eating it is just rude everything you buy and not eating is just wasting your time and their time planting green bean waiting for the bean to be ready and packing it and saying you buy it and just never eat it is painful please everyone don't waste your food just think about the people working hard to bring food to you mabye sometime the best thing about food is people caring about you
1:11 LOL
There is not such thing as too much pepper...
Luigi if you know what’s good for you don’t come in here!
The time would you said Papa John it made me laugh:
For my german friends:"Diese Matze Balls sind Knödel und die gibts auch bei Rewe."
I only know how to make tea ,milk tea ,and milo
Anyone else saw Uchiha tears ;-;
my family can eat alot of pepper we fuckin love pepper
I learned how to make a grape sorbe

I thought this was gonna be a hello fresh ad

"I know how to hold a knife now" *drops the knife on her foot.*
Nice
i am 10 and i know i how to cook
my first ever time cooking was when i was like nine and me and my friend decided to make pancakes- we made a mess everywhere and when cooking, they were still- r a w. but we liked it for some reason because we felt like some professional chefs
The soup's fucking RAWWWqweaf
GOD Bean Green casserole is a great thing  Southerners UNITE
4:36 megumi, itadori and nobara in the background :))
You use a matzo ball mix? I don't respect you anymore.  All of the fun is breaking the matzot and making it yourself! The mix is just... not necessary.
At a football game the other day I was playing in the pep band and there was was a lady who I would guess had just graduated? And she was visiting and hanging out with us and she had red hair and I went hey she looks kinda familiar and then someone called her Ilyssa and then it clicked and I went oh my god but I am certain that was not you 🥲
When it’s pass over again or you just feel like having matza ball soup then you have to make cannonball matza balls which are just matza balls but you squeeze them rather harder than usual and they are so good
I‘ve watched enough Food Wars to know how to cook
Sooo you watchin jujutsu kaisen eeen😉
Quick tip when you are cooking onions don't cut the stem. When you cut the stem it makes your eyes water
Wait what's potluck
As someone who doesn’t have a full dishwasher, just a smaller “portable” countertop dishwasher, finding non-pod dishwasher detergent is harder than you’d think
Bees don’t have knees so when someone says it it’s unreal
You watch jujusu kasien?

yes ill take 5 uchiha tears pls
You should have a second cooking Chanel and the comment section can help you 😎
2:10 what if i told you i could?
I love the anime reference
So a soup that I really enjoy is vegitable soup for a lot of the reasons you like motzabal soup, my great grandmother would make it in a massive pot and hand jar it to give it out to my familly, well the way I think she makes it is to put in some tomatos and tomato juice then add the vegies (stuff like celery, onion, potatoes, and ocra) you let it simmer for a hour or two then jar it, but if you want to make it more like brunswick stew then when you prepare the soup out of the jar then just add some cround meat of some form then viola you have veggie soup! I don't know the actual recipie but you can probably find something similar online.
1:01 “Soup time, soup time, gonna get a pot for some soup crimes, soup time, soup time, veggies in my hand looking mighty fine, soup time, soup time, gonna peel the potato, *cuts, oh...whoops...
Nice video!!!! Love it
SO MUCH ANIME REFENCES !!!!!!!!!!!

Basics with Babish helps a lot.
Ily:And I was going to make (drumroll please)  Ad: Traditional , Glam.
So I’m a new fan here and she doesn’t post often but when she does it’s worth it
the best culinary masterpieces dont compare to my fried egg which is the only thing i can cook
Okay, if you have never had matzoball soup, I genuinely feel sorry for you. My family has a specific recipe that's been passed down generations and it is the most delicious thing I've ever tasted. It always makes me feel really at peace and it tastes like home. My Nana makes it on holidays like Passover and Rosha Shonna and Hanukkah. It holds a very special place in my heart, especially considering it's just a soup. It's awesome to hear someone else talk about it in such a fond way because very few people I know have ever had it before. So if you're reading this Illy, thanks for that, and to everyone else, I hope you all can experience the warm feeling (probably not the exact feeling, but something similar) of sitting around a dinner table with your family on Passover, eating homemade matzoball soup as someone in your family discreetly dumps out some of the wine for Elijah hoping the kids don't notice so the magic remains. Anyways, that was a long rant, have a great day everyone! You are loved!
Am 9 years old I don't care about the fire I make fire
Don’t get me started on my cheesecake disaster ... I nearly burned my kitchen
One time, I was trying to warm up a bun cake and I didn’t know that I couldn’t warm it up in the microwave with a plastic cup and when I took it out the microwave, it melted....
This reminds me of the time when  I almost cut of my whole thumb when I was 3 in the kitchen  luckily only top was cut and then it healed but that was a gross image to experience as a 3 year old
These videos are always hilarious because I'm 13 and know how to do all the stuff she's talking about
4:36 Fine. I'll subscribe.
How do I get out cause I kinda got stuck in the Bowl in the. " Be with the  what thing is it "
One time, i was helping my mom make spaghetti, she was boiling the noodles, so i tried to help here, the stove was on, so i was afraid the water will fling a drop of itself at me.
Yee. Hah was crigey
Green beans casserole slaps. My favorite thing to eat at Thanksgiving.
I'm 24 now and live on my own for 5 years now. Never was a great cook but it was very fun to get started and get better. Since I live with my bf he cooks most of the time and it's amazing but I kinda miss cooking sometimes. Yes, I could cook for both of us, but he would like it as much as his food
*Todoroki sticker on the animated fridge*
I was subbed to u but then it unsubscribed when yourubers say that i though that was bullshit how i was wrong
I loved this so much
Do a series where your learning how to cook
As a man who was born in texas and was raised by a Hungarien family and taught how to cook food at the age of 10.  In my opinion she's doing alright for a novice.
4:36 isn’t that Itadori, megumi and nobura from jujutsu kaisen ?  And arent those mob, pikachu and todoroki ?
6:07 shoto?
🤮 🤢 🤢 Yucky Wucky 🤢 🤢 🤮
3:11 She said my name :)
Wait your parents never taught you how to cook? Not that I am making fun of you  but still I kinda thought it was like a law for parents to teach their kids how to cook.

Once in my house were my aunts, in the evening one of them went to the kitchen to prepare lemonade while the rest of us started talking near her on the floor. We were so involved in the conversation that my aunt, instead of adding sugar to the lemonade, added salt, luckily she was the only one who tried it but it was a lot of fun, it's been almost 10 years and we still laugh about it 🤣🤣
todoroni
Please do a animal crossing update

2 days ago I cooked an egg and I put to much salt :)
Her: Matzo ball soup Me: that looks awfully a lot like Gríz galuska
I made matzo balls once I put mushrooms onions, celery, some spice, carrots and.... p o t a t o e s
I had a pepper incident too once. I made a bechamel sauce for a bacon wrapped pork roast, but I added waaaay too much pepper (I didn't see the TT, TO TASTE, on the pack for the pepper and it was a class assignment to make at home). I ended up with creamy white pepper, and didn't reduce it when I made ALMOST TRIPLE the amount of portions for béchamel. IT DID NOTHING. And then I had a giant tub of inedible pepper sauce leftover.😅 I ended up using a tiny piece of sauce on the roast, and it luckily was an okay balance. But I did throw the rest away..
I'm jewish and on passover when we can't eat grain we eat matzo ball soup and it's SO GOOD.
matzaball soup     i smell a fellow jew

I’m sorry ma’am but no mistake can top my mistake of putting in eleven half a teaspoons of salt instead of one and one half
“So I can grow my hand back, but in real life you can’t do that”  Excuse you miss but a Doctor has done it

Bro, your animation reminds me a lot of Camp Camp!
greenbean casserole doesn't exist in the south its a midwest abomination.
When someone says "potluck" that doesnt me bring something you have never made before.  Lol experiment on YOURSELF.  Not your friends that you like.

I'm being reminded of the time I thought one block of butter was 1 Cup instead of 2 Cups and I put twice the amount of butter needed into my cookies.
Even ratatouille thought everyone could cook. *O O F*

I know how to cook amazing for some and i am just 8
Hay illy are you planning to do a question and Answer
Your videos help my self-esteem
learned those lessons the hard way, a good thing that I now have a "J" shaped scar on my finger and my nickname is James, so... yeah
Here’s a story of how I injured my finger: when I was waiting for my mum in kindergarten I had a smiggle  sharpener and I wanted to get the pencil shavings out but I didn’t know how to open it..so I put my finger through the hole(it was not see through) and brought my finger out of the sharpener and it was bleeding it didn’t really hurt bc my skin was kinda soft
Lets be honest. We have all accedently cut ourselfs
Thank you for letting us know how to hold a knife and kitchen safety, now I can try to peel those potatoes that I couldn't do properly. This is why my cooking skills only work on instant noodles.
I loved the backgrounds and jsut art in general
Awsome
can you cook some taco con carne asada y salsa verde
7:22 "Wam bam Christmas ham" HAHA THAT WAS SO GOOD
Wow, I always thought that I've been holding a knife wrong.
no
Let me tell you a story kinda like the in the video i was pelling a apple and the peller and i dont know whats its called but the peller was the wrong way my finger was bleeding blood was pumping out every second and thats why i dont eat pelled apples
illy you should make an asmr video at 6:41 I could fall asleep

My dad made matzo ball soup for me once when I was younger, the matzo balls were so big that they formed a crust on top of the crock pot, and so doughy that they glued my mouth shut, regardless I’m looking forward to trying to make it my self!

Green bean casserole rocks my dude
I attempted Gigi's spicy vodka pasta,yeah I'm not a fan of spicy nor am I aloud to drink. So no Vodka but didn't think about how the recipe asked for 2 TABLESPOONS OF RED PEPPER FLAKES. I was coughing like someone with a cold. I feel you.
I got a headache right now so I watched half the video and half of another
Everyone watching it normally  Me: see todo and a haikyu sweater and other anime my weeb self  😳
I once added salt to my tea instead of sugar and ohh boy no fun xD
Green bean casserole is amazing
Bro I can barely remove the shell of hard boiled eggs without damaging the white area.
Awesome video
*plot twist* her cat actually makes all of the food-
I love your saitama and todoroki fridge thingy
4:36 is the BESTO FRIEND! If you watch Jujutsu kasion and finished season one you will understand (From todo).

That is fine I Love you videos 🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂😍😍😍😍
Don't feel bad about cooking lol we all make mistakes i myself lol. Idk the reason i learn bc of my mom. And also learn new once of youtube lol. But am glad it went well lol
I feel like you would poison everyone accidentally(including yourself) from just making soup.
Who else suddenly wanted Papa John’s when she said it
I've been cooking since I was 5
I love all of the anime references in the background 🤣
Illy my cooking advice is to ask your mom for cooking advice. Mom’s know more about cooking.
is a soup
Here's my favorite pasta recipe! Its super easy, comforting, and cheap 💜 1 package of ground beef  1 can of mushrooms  1 can of cream of mushroom soup 1 medium container of sour cream 1 box of pasta  1st, put the raw beef in a skillet and add salt garlic powder paprika and onion powder. Cook it until its almost done and then drain your mushrooms and add it to the beef. When your beef is done, add the cream of mushrooms soup and sour cream and the seasonings you seasoned the beef with. Cook that for about 10 minutes and then add your cooked pasta. Enjoy!
5:54 surprised mouse? 5:59 iz iz iz a zoup?
as someone who likes to cook it's wild to find out that people don't know this stuff by default
For those who want to cook, the best advice i can give is that you will never be a cook overnight and the best practice is repetition. Use leftovers, learn flavors and techniques. DO NOT WORRY ABOUT THE FANCY MOVES IN COOKING SHOWS. Learn the ingredients and you will make masterpieces
Me hearing “matzo ball soup” Me searching the meaning of that word in Hebrew  Me: Omggggg are you Jewish????!!!!! (Plus it’s Passover now lol)
Not me looking at the anime stickers 😀
Can we admire the backgrounds please they’re so pretty and they don’t get enough love
Is Soup Time on Spotify?
This motivated me to make a grilled cheese sandwich with sausages in it at 11 in the evening 👍
Omg the jujutsu kaisan picture 🙀
Hi illy I really like your video I memorized the soup time song and ingary time song. You should play angle devil angle with some other animators

My mum's family food passed down is mince n tatties, and I'm a wierdo because I put ketchup in it to give it more flavour and salty.
One time when I was 13 or 14 I wanted to bake from an Instagram recipe. Didn't realize the heat for the oven was in °F and not °C. All my hard work was burned down and I didn't baked since then

First ting learn how much tings need peprt and salt and how much they take to cook its 50 percent of food
Stable video 👍
Something random ... I want a Todoroki tea pot
This is cool and all. But don't let that distract you from the fact that Gru is the most powerful being in the universe. First according to the height of a Minion (which is 3.5 feet on average) Gru is 4 minions tall, which means he is a godly size of 14 feet tall. Second, if any of you remember the original Despicable Me, you know there is a scene when Vector kidnaps the three girls and shoots a series of heat-seeking misses at Gru, he then dodges them all. According to the speed of an average ballistic missile (1900 mph) and the size of the missile according to his ankle size, Gru can perceive and move at such a speed that the missiles only move 9.5 miles per hour, 0.5% of their original speed. Plus after this Gru punches a shark and it is paralyzed meaning its spine is probably shattered, to remind you it would require a force greater than 3,000 newtons to fracture the spine. That’s equal to the impact created by a 500-pound car crashing into a wall at 30 miles per hour. I rest my case.
Is it normal for Americans to not be able to cook until they are an adult because I’m an Australian and at least where I grew up everyone learned how to cook a meal by them self at like the age of 10 and when you go on year 7 camp (11 or 12 years old) you have to cook your own food.
*[insert Hello Fresh sponsor here]*
I don’t care when I make puns in the kitchen because I’m a badass
I did cut my finger once and it was like 3 years ago and my tiny scar is slowly recovering

Women love men who can cook

I was once cutting a orange with a butter knife. I put to much pressure, it slipped, and I cut myself. But it was basically a paper cut I’m fine
the jewish kids who have been eating Matzo ball soup all there life: *smirking face*
Your animation is soooo cute!!!!!!!!😍😍😍
I think everyone makes these mistakes when they start cooking but you just don't see it with some people because they started cooking when they were much younger. Just because you didn't see them mess up doesn't mean that you aren't as good as them, it just means that you need more time
im waaaayyy better than cooking than you i lit a chopstick on fire i think illy and i in the kitchen would be a dangerous combination
HEY ILLY ¿ WHY ARE YOU MECIONING  RATATOUIL  SO MUCH?, IS IT BECAUSE......YOU KNOW......,THE MUSICAL THAT a BUNCH OF CREATORS WERE ORGANAIZING IN MIDS OF 2020 ...YOU KNOW JUST CURIOUS ...

i saw the thumbnail and thought it was a breath of the wild video
you can never get good at cooking without a stitch from a knife and at least a number of burns to not feel the pain
Dude I love green bean casserole and I’m literally having it for dinner tonight
I don't need to cook I watch Gordon Ramsay
Why do you have a Todoroki on your fridge ?
Not to brag but, I've only set the oven and microwave on fire once. Yeah, I'm a pretty good cook 😌🤚
shoto todoroki and i make tea and table spoon wrong
5:59 “Iz-iz-iz-a soup!” Oh illy, I love your videos so much😂😂
Can we get that apron as real merch?
The fact that no one's talking about the Haikyuu references breaks my heart</3
I cook... I´m 12...
Keep trying, Illy! I’m not a very good cook either, but it’s still fun to try!
And yet my father graduated culinary school. I better ask to be taught before I move out-
It’s ok I burn my cereal illy
I love matzo ball lol
When i was young i also used a peeler i was helping my mom and...   Me:*peels almost my whole thumb*  My mom:no..NO  Me:*screams*
I did that once but with Red Pepper flakes instead of ground pepper.... I put 2 Tbsp instead of 2 Tsp. It was very spicy, but delicious and that's how I make it every time now.
I would really like to see what you think loge will we look like if he was a human
I sacred I am an adult from last 3 months and I am sacred of outside world
It’s the ✨soup time✨ for me
One of the first things I noticed was the Todoroki magnet on the fridge. Lol 😂

I like  binging with babish's basics with babish series, his instructions are always clear and he cooks a lot of things I like
Carrots always soak up extra salt
Peppas gonna teach you how to count to three meat canyon style
Did anybody else get it’sfumneh vibes when she said Peppa what are you doing in my soup. No just me OK
for me it was the salt, 1 cup instead of one teaspoon for brownies, lets just say we had it with a LOT of ice cream, then thru it away and ate ice cream.
“If you enjoy having all the fingers you were born with...”  But what if I’m dissatisfied with my current amount of fingers and would like more?
I live in the country and....Illymations is right....green bean cassarole is freaking AMAZING

ITS SOUPTIME SHOULD BE NUMBER ONE ON THE CHARTS
5:50 the sign says uchiha tears. LOL
For 20 years I had never cut myself cooking. Turning 21 changed the tides or something because now it’s all I do.
“i’ve been inspired”  **proceeds to make cookies with no sugar and all salt, calling it being “creative”**
Love you  illy
Am I the only one thT saw the shoto todoroki agent know her refrigerator like if you saw it to👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇
Illy “are you old anther to not be afraid of turning on the stove but still are?” Me “yes”
I’m scared of the stove
Apparently some kind of music studio wants to make a Official music video with your song, *S O U P T I M E*            Why the heck did i get an ad about a game called high heels
anyone saw the jjk easter egg?
my brother just throws all the ingredients that he finds in the pot along with some snail shell shaped spaghetti and some tomato sauce and meat and somehow it works
Cooking scary😨😨😨

I know how to cook eggs perfectly even tho I am so young I could burn my face
Perfect timing with the matza ball soup. Happy Passover!
Perfect for Pesach
Ok but Illy, MOTZA BALL SOUP FROM CANTERS DINNER 🤤
As soon as she said “seasoning,” I immediately started panicking, “Please don’t tell me you put to much pepper. Please!” *sigh* It happens.
“No puns in the kitchen.” Ill how could you?! Puns are half the seasoning!
I'm late miss your vids but hi (·-·) />👑
As a person who loves soup and makes a lot of it, I shall be singing your soup song often.
that moment when you peel your finger, and not the potato
Lol I saw jjk in her wall So cute brotherr✨
I would love to see a cooking tutorial by ILLY
Can we just talk about how DELICIOUS the food looks OwO
Showing your matzaball soup right at Passover time... nice.
I'm pretty young and I make my own scrambled eggs without getting scared lol
I half expected the "soup mama" sound from footofaferret's video
How the hell did you survive without cooking? LIke, how the fuck do you even EAT
You’re Jewish?!
C'mon you can make rawmen without burning the house down
Hey illy  if you get another cat are you gonna call it Peppa
I made pudding before watching this
Im 13 And I Really Like To Use My 13 inch Chef's Knife      My Mom Is Always Scared When I Use It....LOL
Hey illy my bday is on April 1
Im 10 and can cook
She's going crazy by matzo ball
5:50 is no one going to talk about that aisle sign that says "uchiha tears and grace field meat"? Pretty dark ngl
Me: (Tastes my own cooking) That's f**king amazing
*s o u p  t i m e*
tbh im 13 and can kinda cook but not really so whenever i wanna practice i just make mozzerella sticks lol if you want the recipe ask
I remember this group project in school where we needed to add cups of sugar... we added a mysterious packet into our flour mix... it was a cup of salt :)))
Is this soup German? We know it here as "Hochzeitssuppe" that translates to "marriage soup". Because back in the days it was a real pain in the ass to make the balls so it was only made for special occasions.
You can definitely tell she has worked with Michael and William when she talked in this video
I feel like all courses should be like this. You're so calm and collected, and it feels like we're both learning together. You and I are both learning from our mistakes, and this is just the best way to learn   I love your videos, I hope you make some great food in the future lmao  ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I own 2 knifes and i not scared even though I’m 10 years old
Peppa, what are you doing in my soup? ;)
IN  2:34 WAS THAT A KARASUNO JACKET? AND IN 5:15 I SAW TODOROKI AWOOGA
As a rat myself, my cooking advice to you is don’t add to much yeast to your muffins....and don’t go watch a video that makes hard to hear a timer.
I appreciate the jujutsu kaisen painting in the background 🤩🤩🤩
Bruh green bean casserole is delicious
Eso me recuerda a mí lavando el tenedor y me lo clavo, osea fue un gran dolor!!! 😣 Grito y mi mamá en plan: conchale, qué te paso?. Yo:......Ahhh, me clave el tenedor!!! 😪
“ *gasp* Peppa? What are you doing in my *śøùp¿* ”
So? You love your subscribers. Heart every comment
Yeah I make dubious food in Breath of the Wild. What of it.
So funny story, in senior year I was in a cooking class for school and I was making omelettes for my group of 4. And the recipe called for a shake of pepper. I was going to do the shake but right as I turned it upside down, the big hole dumped out half of the container of pepper into the eggs. Apparently the group from the class before didn’t close it right, and when I took it out it looked closed, so… it ruined the omelette. I showed the teacher and she was like “oh that’s a big mistake and sucks” so I asked if it was possible to get 2 more eggs since that was my omelette and I had made all the others theirs, and my teacher laughed at me and told me no. My group mate took it and said it was no problem and he would eat it. Took one bite and, I kid you not, he looked like he was doing the cinnamon challenge. He was a trooper and I offered to buy him lunch as an apology. He declined, but man do I feel bad for how that all went down 😂😂
Green bean casserole is one of my favorite foods
I want you to eat Maggi. I think you'll like it.
You’re not a bad cook, you just need practice.
What do you use to animate??👀💖
I looooooooooove green bean casserole. I'm not even southern lol I've always wanted to try Matzo Ball soup (Is that how you spell it?)
Max saying "yucky wucky" is now the most cursed thing I've heard in years
You know, my dad may have not taught me much about adulting but I'm glad he taught me how to cook. 😂
Everyines talking about Soup time, but yall be sleeping on Injury time ✋😤
I LOVE matzo hall soup! It’s so good! And I’m not even Jewish!
"Anyone can cook!" I almost burnt the house down with a toaster and tortilla wrap..

5:51 Uchiha Tears, I’ve been dying laughing for the past minute and I can’t stop please send help
Peppa what are you doing in my soup?
That's some good _Maaz-aball_ soup! (no I don't need my fingers, it's okay)
As a jewish person,I can attest that matzo ball soup is everything! also,since we're in the middle of the holiday pesach,I get to eat matzo ball soup whenever I want,cuz my mama keeps making it
When i cut myself with a peeler my blood was literally flowing out and it was all over my shirt and pants and i walked into my parents room bloody as hell and asked for a band aid
When I was 9 I somehow forgot the water I side of a ramen packet.
I went to colonary school and got a degree and I was the exact same. And next time you make matzo ball soup you should add some green fried tomateos to it. I know it sounds gross but if you fry them right it's amazing.
I love all of the effort that you put into your videos. You are doing great! Keep up the good work!
I sliced my finger during HomeEc and was too shy to cause a scene so I just kept cutting... probably unsanitary. It was tomatoes so no one noticed so it’s okay😅
illy there is a dish u must try idk if u will like it but take some panner and grate it and then add serecha and then boil pasta for 8 min and then drain it mix it with the panner and serecha and enjoy ( sry if my spelling is wrong english is not my first language)
I SEE THAT PICTURE!!!
I LOVE GREEN BEAN CASSEROLE!!!
U thought I wouldn't notice o oh no icy hot aka todiroki is on your fridge mha all day baby woooo
I remember the first time I tried making gravy. I could not get it incorporated correctly, and the texture/color seemed like it was all off. It just so happened that I was watching season two of Downton Abbey for the first time, too, and had it playing on my laptop in the background. Just as I was looking in the pot and thinking I must have messed something up, I heard Mrs. Patmore’s voice behind me shouting “what in wonderland do you call that?” A deflated Lady Sybil replied “I knew it didn’t look right!” And the scene concludes with Mrs. Patmore saying “No, my lady. I’d go so far as to say that there is no food on earth that is supposed to look like that.”  None of this was what you would call encouraging.
Are you gonna make Mac Sticks anytime?
Jujitsu kaisen fans where y’all at
Yucky Wucky

Hey illy! I can give you a simple bread recipe I made if you want. I also have a tea recipe from a video game
I’m sorry illy but the best way to make green bean casserole is with fried onion, cheese, green beans, and cream of mushroom
Quote: Make Sure your knife is Sharp   She is Brain

THE POWER PUFF GIRLS REFERENCE IN THE BEGGING I LOVE
When I was like 4 I was peeling potatoes with my grandma, and I did it wrong... so I ended up peeling my hand almost to my elbow........ also I was cooking at 4 because it’s my favorite thing and I probably annoyed my grandma into submission and forced her to let me help
I was born with no fingers
If my stove turned on like that   I would be afraid
Cooking steaks while watching this
Me looking out for all the anime references
I make a MEAN green bean casserole. It’s my favorite dish
Illy: I am a TeRrIbLe Cook and I make a ToN of mistakes and you should never listen to me. Also Illy: So you should hold the knife like THIS so that you won’t get hurt
I don’t know how I was 4 days late to this but ily
Making soup at any period of time is always appreciated :)
ok, i love all of the anime references in the background 😂  and thank you. or teaching us how to hold a knife properly (ive been cooking since i was 10 ans didnt know the part about holding the top part of the blade)
Bruh your worse then Gobden Ragmpsay
As an 13 year old who cooks alot, this video is a hard reality check
Anyone can cook. 🐀
Ok but that ad placement was amazing LMAO
Why do know what taxis taste like . did you not pay your bill ???
Green bean casserole is always the second best dish at thanks giving. A very close second to mashed potatoes

My grocery stores don’t sell uchiha tears is that like a limited edition thing or...

Laughs in culinary classes.
You made the same mistake everyone did, the tablespoon trickster
Who cuts apples over the stove?
Mazz's voice bus hilarious
There's a Todoroki magnet!
I know how to cook but this is gold.
Uhhh l know how to make that soup is very easy
Wait you Jewish as well
Hey Illy. My dad makes the best parmesan noodles.saute 1/2 cup of onions & 3 garlic bits. Season some chicken breasts with salt, pepper, lemon juice, and sometimes thyme. Then cook chicken breasts in the oven. Cook some spaghetti or fettuccini noodles but not all the way through. Add the garlic, onions, and chicken into the same pan, melt a pad of butter and 1/2 cup of parmesan cheese.
i am a culinary arts student i  gotta say completely corecto
damn i really like how you draw the backrounds!

I have a recipe .boiled soft tortilla .orange and white shredded cheese
Am I the only one who'd use cajun spices and fill it with prawns
Have watched in a while and it’s great to be back. Especially since I just started cooking too.
My dad says boys can’t cook so I gave up because he might be true
Okay now I saw a jujutsu kaisen besties pic on the wall and I can't stop thinking about it. I WANT ONE TOO
5:52 UCHIHA TEARS
Love the amount of effort you’ve put into making this video!! Good job!! :3
I live in the Midwest, and if there’s no green bean casserole at Christmas or Thanksgiving or Easter, you’ll never hear the end of it.  Now with that said, I don’t like green bean casserole and my extended family thinks I’m weird. Pain is real
I actually love matzos ball soup because there's a resteraiunt in studio city outside Hollywood (i used to live there) called solly's  that serves THE BEST MATZOS BALL SOUP!!!! they also serve these awesome bagel chips and pickle spears lol
Anyone else think Illy singing Soup Time is super cute?
So many jujutsu kaisen references-
I died laughing when I saw “Grace Field meat”  5:52 💀✋
The misread on how much pepper to add reminds me the time where I added too much salt to oatmeal raisin cookies. This was a few years ago when I was in highschool and as a care package for my brother, who was a collage RA, I made him some oatmeal raisin cookies. This recipe was from an old family recipe but I wasn't sure how to read off tbsp or tsp because sadly my school cut home ec. to put in more testing. Yeah that really sucked. Anyway I added a tbsp of salt instead of tsp and they were supper salty. My brother took a bite and didn't like it. Instead of throwing it out, he gave them to is attendants on this dorm floor mostly to see what their reaction to be. He told me he appreciated the thought and reassured that I will improve over time for baking and cooking. He also said it was hilarious seeing everyone's reaction when eating those salty cookies. I've improved my cooking and baking skills since, but your story about the pepper made me remember this. Great video as always.
yess somebody else who eats motza ball soup
I remembered I had the same injury with my finger while I was making myself and my dad a drink it took my finger to heal for 1 or 2 weeks to heal I now have a scar on it Edit: I’m a good cook but sometimes I suck at cooking
As a Romanian, let me tell you how much I love soup (we even have a different name for it "ciorba"). Here it's such a usual sight that it's not really considered "sth you eat when you are sick". When I was little I would eat it sometimes daily or once every 2 days.
Can anyone tell me what's the background music 6:45? Like it's so relaxing.
im in latin america how can i get it
Finally some else likes motsaball soup
You're definitely right about the Matzo Ball Soup- I eat it every year for Passover, and it's just the best thing ever
(ง'̀-'́)ง wanna fight?
4:23 *hakkebakkkeskogen flashbacks*
One time I was making boxed cake mix and it said to add 1/4 cup of vegetable oil and wellllllllll •__• I added a cup. Fire ovens are fun
Us Jewish kids all love dat matzo ball soup
Shouldn't have watched this at 12 PM after skipping breakfast. I'll finish the video later, time to get some food
I LOVE KNEIDELACH IN SOUP, 100000% BETTER THAN NOODLES (best is when you can have them both) the best comfort food and one of the few good pesach foods lol (matzoh sucks, sorry)
pp pupu
I don’t really like my right pinkie finger so I could take it or leave it honestly
The fact that she put the sponsors at the end of the video makes it feel like watching the credits roll in a good movie. I usually get so annoyed when people bring up the sponsors first, but I'm not the one to dictate what they do with their video. I just really appreciate that.
did only I see the jujutsu kaisen references throughout the video? The Itadori drawing in the recepie was my favourite :)
I would actually use a Luigi apron if I could buy one.
2:08 nice fma fridge decor
This is so much fun!  Thank you for this video! You are very funny!
I actually took hospitality at school and it was very interesting subject to take and I'm glad I did. Even though it was a lot of work and alot to remember it was fun to do because I learnt how to cook as well
Can we talk about how the soup in the thumbnail looks like estus soup from dark souls
1:12 I did that once i now have a scar it was my whole index finger skin on one side
What is peppa doing to the soup
_wow very cool_
is it weird that if i hurt myself while im cooking and if im bleeding crazy then im going to allow a tiny bit to bleed into meh food so i can remember how much work i put into the meal so i enjoy it
illy: They won't BEEP-ing cook!!
I feel like teenage white girl right now. Not sure why.
I still can't open on of those jars with the slightly explosive clasps. I have to get one of my parents to open the jar when I make pancakes XD
Loved that little soup song
Ok but- green bean casserole really is bomb. Just sayin’.
One time when I was camping I was using a knife to cut a walnut and I was cutting it to I could get to the middle and I did not know there was a nut in side so..yeah, so I was using the knife to cut if and all of a sudden the knife slips and GOT ON MY FINGER CUTTING IT!!! and I was all like mother please get me a bandage, then I started crying and screaming. But just don't cut a walnut because... well the name there's a nut in side so yeah.
1:33 Me sitting watching this with a bandage round my hand cause I sliced open my finger: 👁👄👁
fun fact a sharp knive hurt less then a dull knives
Idk but was the girl with pigtails wearing A Karasuno haikyuu jacket
The jjk potrait hit unexpected. Good luck.
I eat 4 table spoon of pepper in noodles     And now its increasing every day by one table spoon
I couldn't make pancakes before and I can't cook none but I learn how to do it from quarantine lol.
I have matzo soup every passover i have a warning though i tryed it with rice dont do that
1:21 OH I THOUGHT WE ARE GOING TO USE OUR HANDS TO CUT... it is just a joke
Why did i not get notified :(
Eyyyy, Yuuji from Jujutsu kaisen
😔👊
''peppa what are you doing in my soop''(☞ﾟヮﾟ)☞
Are we just gonna ignore the fact that illy put "uchiha tears" on  the sign at 5:50 🤣
I bought 3 of those aprons, I'm really excited to use them!
I saw that haikyuu reference 👀
6:19 peppaaaaaaa
Lets just respect the little details of anime like Jjk or mha like gurl- I love this
The jujutsu kaisen references
Why is the corn so scared at the end and then the other foods are just very chill explain what’s happening
REMY is a icon!!!!!🐀🐀
Honestly I really enjoy cooking, but I don’t eat half the stuff I put into my food because I’m incredibly picky. And majority of time there’s no one to eat my food, so I just don’t cook that much overall 🤷‍♀️
Two  illymation nani
hey illy can you play Friday night funkin
How many eggs would I need for 4 servings of matzo balls
What if someone don't have matzo meal? I'm from Poland and we have matzo, but I'm first time heard about matzo meal. And also matzo balls.
There’s a really easy recipe I did with my mom that we called ✨mush✨ It’s just chopped peppers, onions, chicken, ham then u throw it in a pan and add cheese
6:20 " peppa, what are you doing in my soup? more like how did you get there lol :) that was random, love it
My mom puts a large amount of importance on my brothers and I knowing how to cook. My brothers can both cook really good stuff, and I’m learning. As soon as I was old enough to be trusted with boiling water and the oven I had to make my own lunches on weekends. I can make an awesome pasta and I discovered a way to roast hot dogs without a fire. I’m hungry now
Been cut by a potato peeler before, that shit hurts
Legit mid sentence bout ye green been casserole it went "because-" than got interupted by "ITS THE EASIET, AND THE CHEESIEST! CREST, FOR THE WIN WIN!"
Is that Mob Psycho on your fridge :O
When I was 10 I peeled my middle finger by accident when I was desperately trying to peel an apple.  I am still traumatized and still cannot peel an apple without getting an anxiety attack.  *yAaY-*
me expecting  hello fresh sponser
This art style and detail makes me question just why other youtube animators take so long to make videos
-sees Todoroki picture- *insert happy noises*
1:22  People born with no fingers: 👁👄👁
Keep with it, you'll be flexing your skills in no time. Thank you for the video/how to
Wait... Her local grocery store sells *UCHIHA TEARS* ?  I gotta get me some of those for the next time I feel like testing my limits 🤔
The matzo balls have egg in  Bye bye matzo ball soup :^(
yes
loved the todoroki on the fridge AND the jujutsu kaisen picture frame😌
I. need. that. apron.
A beautiful trick for soup base is to use a grater to grate the onion, carrot, and celery together. I chop now but it does save time cooking and removes the scary knifes. Also bay leaves make soup better. Always.
same....same
can i put remy in the soup
potato potatooooo
Illy: you are REMY   Me, only half paying attention: I mean yes but how did you know that-
GREEN BEAN CASS IS DELICIOUSSSSS
Motza ball soup reminds me of the monster ball soup from hotel Transylvania
Todoroki on fridge
You’re so good at animating. What program(s) do you use?
Passover started 2 days ago so ive been drinking a lot of matza ball soup and ive been eating a lot of matza
I've worked in Domino's and I've met some nutcases that mess around with some of the pizza dough. Cinnamon rolls, pizza rolls, cinnamon pineapple pies, pepperoni rolls, etc. This is what pizza delivery boys/girls/kids do during the slow times.
I learned how to cook steak at the age of 8
Me who doesn’t have all the fingers I was born with: .. I want my finger back...  (Born with an extra finger condition so it was just a piece of meat with a fingernail 🤢
It is so bizarre to me that some people have no idea how to cook. My mother had me help her in the kitchen when I was nine. She even encouraged me to take classes at school that taught me how to cook and sew and even taught me about checks and taxes. Now I am an adult and I have friends who didn't  have these things and it blows my mind.
When you burned the onions to caramelize it....
SHE PUT A RATTAOULLIE THE MUSICAL REFRENCE IM SCREAMING IN JOO OYOYYYHYHH
Now you tell me to be safe in the kitchen. I already lost 7 of my 13 fingers
Did the knife that cartoon you dropped a little after the 3 minute mark hit cartoon you's foot?
❤
One time I accidentally poured like a half cup of pepper into my pasta and I started to have a panic attack   (I fished out the peppery part and mixed in the pasta it turned out fine but mama was a little angry)
Ok so as a chef you don't really need to do a claw when you chop unless you are chopping really fast then you should do that the point of that is to minimize damage if you cut yourself but if you are just chopping normally you don't need to do the claw for most people it's a bit akward and hard to get used to so illy next time try to do a bit more research before you try and teach people stuff
I started cooking since I was 3
Im not already a grown up yet and I can already see myself in 5 years eating Pop tarts at 10 pm 5 days a week for the next 3 months.
7:10 *they won’t f(bleep)king cook!*  - Illymation 2021
its not cooking if you dont burn the house down while making burritos
Being a proficient baker and chef This beautiful beautiful video warmed my soup-loving heart! I haven't known Illymation for too long, but this is NOW my absolute favorite video! Keep cooking illymation <3 You're doing great!!! <3
"✨pEpPaAa✨ what are you doing in my ✨sOuPpP✨😳" -illy  HAHA YES I LOVE YOU ILLY!!! ✨✨💕💕💕
I cook with my mom, dad, grandmother on my dads side and grandfather on my moms side so I learn how to make a lot of stuff hehe. My dad teaches me how to mix spices that taste good together and cook by intuition. in our family, cooking is very important and most of our meals are home-cooked since we cant afford to eat out very often, and my goal is to cook most of my stuff myself by the time im old enough to move out since its a skill that i think is very important. By now i know how to make some basic meals like chicken, chili, curry, pasta, stir-fry, etc, but id like to learn even more so if i ever have a family i can provide them with the same delicious home cooking that i had growing up
Pasta
This video taught me more adult skills than highschool
For me learning to cook was required before I moved out my mother worked to much to cook every night. Me and my siblings took turns cooking.
did any one see todoroki on the fridge
Once my sister accidentally added 2 TABLESPOON of salt into mashed potato instead of 2 teaspoon
I actually started cooking food when i was 13 from bacon 2 eggs 2 french bread 2 boiled eggs 2 lasagna 2 spagetti 2 chicken broath 2 fried fish 2 basically other kinds of foods  Soon ill make some pizza,calzone and maybe some cake  Soo i cam make the basics for food and they be berry delicious 😊
BAKING GLOVES
ok you really like jujutsu kaisen we get it illy
You make me not want to cook and more practice kitchen safety.
I LOVE ALL THE LITTLE ANIME DEATAILS!!!!
I don't know why but I get Sunstone vibes (from Steven Universe) when I hear Illy give instructions and advice on cooking
I'm fasting and watch this....
Another safety tip! Get a knife block, (my dad has one cause we are a BIG meat family.) they usually come in sets and even have knife sharpeners!
It’s currently Passover and I can confirm that matzo ball soup is addictive and the best
Are you A furry? Seems like it.
And don't mix up baking soda with baking powder 😂
I lived in Georgia until I was almost 22 and that GREEN BEAN CASSEROLE OMG I love that stuff so muchhhh
6:19 what are you doing step pepa?
sorry man i just chara it with the knie no safty here B)
Why are you people's asses exploding after eating Chipotle!?  It's rice and meat and to-may-toe!  There is nothing there for your ass to freak-out over!
Tea ?
yall are gonna ignore the fact that on the end card the jar says connie-
You have a new Spotify succes
So you've shown us what you like to cook, but what do you like to bake? Cookies, Brownies, Cupcakes, Pies, Cannoli?
my matzo ball soup: wait is she jewish? Is she the first mother fricking jewish YouTuber I've ever watched? If she was jewish that would be really awesome.  Also: happy passover!
What about if i dont want my fingers?
2:34. OYA OYA OYA IS THAT A HAIKYUU REFERENCE I SEE BC I SEE THE LIL FOOT ON HER JACKET
As someone majoring in culinary arts, I appreciate you teaching people how to ACTUALLY hold a knife
All I can make is pasta 😋
illy : "do you make good food?"     me : *no I splate ketchup on 2 pieces of bread and call it food*
Im able to cook a lot of things and soup is... Not my forte, I can barely make any soup except for ramen
Food is intense, maybe a little too much (with a pinch of sa... swears)
i had matsa ball soop at this thing we did called passover
why is peppa in your soup?
Death is always around the corner, but the good thing is that we might end up being someone's next meal.
*I need a full soup song cover.*
NO PUNS IN THE KITCHEN
I just realized on your fridge is a todoroki Magnet cool
that ball soup sounds great me my sister should make it
8:47 puns are the lowest form of comedy
SHE UNDERSTANDS THE LUV FOR MATZAAAAAAAAAA
4:38 was that jujutsu kaisen hahahah fushiguro,itadori,and nobara
ha motza balls...
Fun Fact - my family love green bean casserole and it has to be PERFECT I mean PERFECT. So we gave the first bite to my dad and he said it’s okay my family was freaking out like IT NEEDS TO BE BETTER! XD
Don't worry. I can't cook either.😞
This video made me hungry
I loved my grandma's homemade green bean casserole when she was still alive.
Just in time for pesach with the Matzah ball soup!🥣
I loved my grandma's homemade green bean casserole when she was still alive.
Did you ever get Biscuit in ur acnh island??
Matzo ball soup tastes so good
Never tried Matzo Ball soup before but now you've inspired me to ask my mom to get some so I can make it for the whole family!
4:14 anyone notice itadori in the side of the screen?
My dad started to teach me how to cook when I was four, so when I was older I could cook dinner for the family while he slept.
I like the fact that you are I need to talk to an audience but no is there🤣
How does this so true
5:09 did anyone see todoroki in there?
I know how to heat up my instant ramen in the microwave  Counts as cooking right?
At about 7:32 she said and enjoy and after that exact sentence I got an ad saying wawas hand crafted beverages perfect timing at its peak
Maybe I.. Can regrow my hands back? 👀
The fruit peeler thing happened to me :(
me : paying very close attention to the video because i know i will find many anime related things also me : being a huge weeb so i found all of them-
One of the mistakes I made cooking I was making steaks which was later referred to as Diablo Steaks. I was putting Cajun seasoning on it but I put too much on it. It was so bad that I had to wear a mask while cooking it, but it had tasted so good.
I just had matzah ball soup leftovers for dinner. So your kit recipe was a wonderful surprise. There are recipes online to make matzah balls from scratch. And we normally use chicken broth with celery and onions. It’s a wonderful soup.
Welcome back to life stories, today we will learn how to cook
Illy what do you use for animating and drawing?
I Like Love You (very much ty for your vids and your channel 🥰)
I love your mood swings of the motza balls! :D
Green bean casserole is actually really good
I feel that not putting the proper proportions of seasoning in food. One year I almost ruined a pumpkin pie by almost putting a cup of salt in it-
*we're going to need a full version of soup time, illy*
the video is really funny and i really enjoyed it, but i have a suggestion! if you want to, i think it would be cool if you did a Q and A. you don’t have too it’s just a suggestion! :D     ps i love your channel :)
not me making that exact soup 2 days after the vid was posted
3:00 Lol, when she dropped the knife here, when she was ready to cook, I actually flinched at the drop of the knife. 😅
5:11 NEGATIVITY BEGONE im sorry TxT
OMG MATZO BALL SOUP IS SOOOOO GOOD! I had it last night for Passover and may I just say, *chefs kiss*👌🏻
At the beginning i was expecting “skillshare”
I tried to bake cupcakes without a recipe... I made bread cakes...they weren't good 😂 xx
I litterly stayed and watched the add 😏might have to go and cop me one them approns
This makes me want to make matzo ball soup but soup weather just ended.
peppaaaaaa
Greenbean casserole is sooooooo good
3:56 Sign me up, I love green been
Bold of you to assume that I'm not a mii with stubs for hands.
4:15 is that jujutsu kaisen?
Regarding knife tips - do not think you can lax on these rules or let yourself get a little distracted if you’re used to it. I’m 25 - been cooking since I was ten, and have used a knife fairly regularly on my own for over 10 years. Still managed to take off a good chunk of my ring finger while making soup back in October.   It’s healed now (short of a lack of sensation in that fingertip) and I’ve taken it upon myself to learn professional level knife skills since then, but learn from my mistakes. No matter how good you’ve gotten, accidents happen, and there’s always room to improve ❤️
WOW! How did you make your background so CUTE!
2:27 furry illy
Me growing up in the south and not liking green bean casserole: 🤨🤨🤨
You're not an adult unless you say you are.
The ad before the video started: We fight the battles no one has faught before. We dont win wars, we save lives. Join the military 2021. Me: 🥺😢 Illy: Are you a young aspiring professional ready to take on the world? Me signing up for the military: I am now
I help my mum cook and I am already nervous and now I feel as if I cant go near a stove thanks a lot illy
OMG THE SOUP IS SOOOO GOOD! !!!! I TRIED IT!!!!
Potato’s🥔😔 R.I.P.
i see animay in the back round and all so nice todoroki magnit
6:19 I REALLY THOUGHT YOU WERE GONNA SAY "peppa you silly goose what are you doing in my soup youre so silly" BYEE
Illy: And I was going to make... Me: MAC'S STICKS!? Illy: Green bean casserole.       Me: sobs in corner
PEPPA TOOK ME OUT 🤚😭😭😭😭😭
Horrified mexican sounds seeing censored tacos
Oh my gosh I love the jujutsu kaisen framed picture in 4:38🤩🤩🤩 Honestly I love all the anime references

Ace attorney refence T&T
Another reason you’re supposed to use sharp knifes instead of dull knifes is that, if you cut yourself with the knife, a sharp knife will hurt less than a dull knife. Or that’s what my Family and Consumer Science teacher told the class.
Passover was only a little while ago <333
Not peppa
MATZAH BALL SOUP! YASSS
Love your animation style
Me when I make homemade matza balls and they sink: oh no
Oh my gosh MATZO BALL SOUP IS THE BESSSST!!!!!!
I don’t have these problems cuz I helped my parents with cooking as a child
How do you "polish" tacos?
SPONGE NOODLES!?! I'LL TAKE YOUR ENTIRE STOCK!!! Edit: oh hi abnormal chaos
Illymation is now one with the soup
Someone remix Soup Time/Injury Time plz
I wanna make some matzo ball soup now 🥺
We still give a friend shit for adding 2 tablespoons of salt to the homemade vanilla icecream they were making...
I think I have a phobia of the kitchen now.
4:35 beautiful
In Israel we call the Matzo balls Knaidalach which usually made with Matsa flour. Illy, are you Jewish?
Whee! I'm going to college for this stuff! And work! So my school life, work life, and home life is all in the kitchen!
Good tip: peel the potato not your finger
It’s so bad it needs to be sensord
Any wone can cook exept me i set a pan on fire
I love the jujutsu kaisen stuff in the background
I like cheese
I like cheese
Just wanna say that i really enjoy the little anime references <3
The Todoroki fridge magnet 😭😭
Holy shit, its been like 3 years!! You already hit 1m🎉
babies can't cook
Todoroki from my hero academia on the frige
2.33 yachi from haikyu?
when ur not a adult : oh well become p r e p a r e d
I was scared when you didnt upload 😞                                                               👉👈
As someone who isn't dorming for college, I'm dabbling in cooking myself. There are so many things I want to make. I'm currently proudest of a fried rice dish.
Did anyone else see the Todoroki magnet on the fridge? It’s at 5:35
I'm sorry, this might be because i'm mexican, but, how can tacos be hard to make? You just need a Tortilla, and not whatever crunchy thing americans use as the tortilla, that is a "Tostada" I'd say, and whatever you want to add to your taco
Maz
Green bean casserole is fricking amazing and everyone hating it can go eat egg shells   T o d o r o k i  m a g n e t  How dare you not like potatoes :,0
These tips are great but the only wrong part is the claw knife technique. You dont need to claw your fingers you can just cut slowly because no one is expecting your meal to be cooked within 20 minutes (more or less)
I Dunno why but I love Sharp Objects
I love green bean casserole -w-
4:36
*Comment your favorite food that is from your national*   👇🏽
UwU love dis video
I have a chicken noodle soup recipe that I came up with, and I love it. The main difference is I don't dice the chicken, I shred it (also I hate celery so no one else really eats it, but I love it!)
It’s Passover and matzah ball soup is in the Passover satyr

The four Hogwarts houses, @afewbruises, @RealZade, @AbnormalChaos, and @iumba_  !
I am glad Youtube recommended me this out of the blue. Such an enjoyable video to watch.
The only things I know how to cook properly are Egg Sandwiches and Pork Chops 😀🔫
The timing and pacing of the animation and jokes are so FLIPPIN GOOD
I’ve always dreamed about making my own café, and it would have all of my experiencing drinks, and I love the idea. But I’m broke and a teenager XD, but I think it would be so fun
At least you don’t try to cook stuff from Zelda games.
Her videos are good but that upload time be like McDonald's ice cream machine
Onetime my brother used vinegar instead of oil to make popcorn.
I'd never thought I'd hear Illy say "Big Matzo Balls" so many times.
ily: green bean casserole I know what you're thinking me: Green bean casserole that sounds delicious!   amaazing: ew me: *shock* : O Also I genuinely did not know it was a southern thing that shit is great though, I also tried to make it once and it ended up a bit soggy.
You should make a song called Soup time
I recommend using hello fresh to learn how to cook.
Haha saw your todoroki Easter egg on the fridge :)
To make green bean casserole even better what my mom dose is add bacon
i see a hidden todoroki on the fridge, you watch my hero academia🤫
Hey illy! That thumbnail was actually really pretty! I literally cant stop looking at it, to the point where I have to go to another video, so I can see the thumbnail in the recommended videos list. Kudos!
5:06 look at the fridge todoroki is like bruh
This is the most important post you’ll ever read.  Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers.. Yet this is only four of our many transgressions.  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love, so 2000 years ago, Jesus Christ left his throne in heaven and came to this earth. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake .  Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’.. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..  Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him, and through gratitude in the sacrifice of his son, repent (turn away) from your old way of life. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, your savior, and the ruler of your life from this moment forward ( Romans 10:9 ).   Do these things, and you will be saved.  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to obey his word. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife.   You’ve been informed; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you spend ETERNITY, meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make; And all of us here, whether believer or atheist, know deep down that every last word here is true.  Jesus Christ awaits YOU this very moment. Don’t even think about sleeping tonight until you surrender your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed... And as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 ) ;  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’.
Soup time!
I cut my finger with a bread knife once while cutting bagels
I DID THE SAME FUCKING THING PUTTING TOO MUCH PEPPER IN GREEN BEAN CASSEROLE
Of course the animation is great, but also the animation in her VOICE 😍 amazing.
Can you cook pancakes!!!
me cutting my fingertip of from a knife .thanks lly that would be I bit more helpful like 2 months ago
Very cool
Soup time is stuck In my head on loop
O H M Y G O D....  I did the same mistake with the potato peeler and cut the side of my thumb right open....F u n. (DONT WORRY I WAS OKAY, IT WAS A SMALL PART AND WE GOT IT FIXED AND CHECKED) And since then Im not allowed to peel potatos-
I love cooking, I’m a minor and I grew up cooking food myself! All I remember is don’t burn yourself, use the right measurements but if you spill a bit don’t panic, don’t cut yourself(If lizards can grow back their limps you CANT), just don’t die-
Thank God for instant Ramen and I will say that
PAPA JOHNS
Me seeing Grace field meat at illy mart: Conny do you want to be seasoned with herbs or pepper

I love how she make so many haikyuu reverences
2:32 actually I don’t like my fingers
Walter, so te mazo ball is like te bori bori but... different?

I'm the type to burn water
This video gave me confidences for more cooking and entertainment!
Happy Passover everyone
For me an add started the second she finished saying Green bean casserole
Anyone else see Uchiha Tears 5:50
Noooooo[oooooooooooooooo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Once wanted to bake brownies for my mom for her birthday. I followed the recipe I found as closely as possible.   It was looking great, even went a bit off recipe to add M&Ms to the mix, and also a pinch of salt to bring out the chocolate flavor. It wasn't until it was in the oven that I realized... I put in a whole stick of *salted* butter.   When they were done the brownies tasted like potato chips.
i think i  see todaroki on the fridg :)
*rat*
Technically you can’t tell if she still has all her fingers
Animes hinted towards/shown include:jujutsu kaisen,pokemon,my hero academia,and one more I don't know the name of plz tell me I'm the reply section
Oh my gosh your art is so great the backgrounds are so detailed and pretty :0
The animation is stunning.

Do I have comments if not, I love this channel! And animal crossing too! You have good cooking though your not bad 😊.

Matzoh ball soup, yum!!! Chag sameach everyone!
She. Has. A. Shoto. Todoroki. Fridge. Magnet.

Can I just say....     This video inspired me to make strawberry cupcakes
JUST A LITTLE COMMENT BUT BISKIT WAS IN MY ANIMAL CROSSING NEW LEAF CAMPSITE EARLIER AND HES MOVING IN
I agree on the green bean casserole. Only good way to eat green beans.
GREEN BEAN CASSAROLE IS SO GOOD i make pretty good green bean cassarole

In Hebrew, Matzo balls are called Kernadel.
I can't Sub to Illiy she's too passionate and she's already sponsored by a food box.

Just saying if people want to cook more quality and varied meals I recommend hello fresh or any other food service like it because it gives easy recipes to follow and they have every food catagory plus the meals are amazing and they ship in almost every country.(btw I'm not sponsored I'm just going on person experience)

I learned alot of stuff about knifes today, now I can cook some spaghetti without cutting my who arm
One time, I was making box cupcakes with an ex friend, and we used the ICING mix for the cake and the CAKE mix for the icing. Needless to say, they were veeeeeery gloopy :p
welcome to another round of: find those anime easter eggs!
MOTZEL BALL SOUP = happiness trust me
I once saw a show with a professional dessert chef who accidently used salt instead of sugar in cookies and got eliminated from the competition.
Yes I am a young inspired professional I've been cooking 6 yrs well I'm not a adult only 16
Fun fact thanks for showing me in the video illmation studio

Hi illy
watching this while eating canned ravioli. im proud.
Peppa, what are you doing in my soup?
Just noticed the thumbnail had Remy :D
Oh yes Matzo Ball soup.... a Jewish classic having some tonight because its passover a Jewish Holiday :D
I know this sounds stupid but the Disney princess cookbook has some bomb recipes. I got the book as a little girl, and i still use it to this day. The recipes are really simple and they’re rated based on difficulty. My personal favorites are Gus’ Mac and cheeseburger, Bayou meatloaf, Abu’s monkey bread, and ariel’s sweet sea foam smoothie.
Me but eight: can cook green bean casserole myself, isn't scared to flip pancakes but never has.
I didn't get a notification for your Video releaseee this is si saddd if wth YouTube?!!

I did cooking contests and I thankfully never cut my hand but, we learned how to hold the knife and a tip hold the knife in your not wringing hand. Like if your right handed hold it in your left
This is the coolest channel I've found in a while! Love it!
I was able to cook when I was 9
Hi there illy I was wondering if u got animal crossing new horizons like you said in your “obbeson with animal crossing” video if u have I would love if you found the dog villager that u love
I love the ✨baking gloves✨
First it was Mac sticks, and now it’s matzo ball soup.
Illymation: "Cooking can gather people together!"  *Me who learned to cook simply to avoid people*: Uhhhhh....
Chomp chomp chomp “interesting flavor tastes like taxes “
I learned 1. The hard way. Do NOT get to close to the pan while mom is cooking, or will get a burn on your chin (it smelled so good tho). And one time while I was cutting fruit for my breakfast, the knife 🔪 wanted to cut my finger (and I felt like I was gonna die). To make it all worse, my mom was at work and my dad was walking the dog, so I was all alone, with a bleeding finger, and an empty stomach at the age of 10. (Because I was making breakfast and I haven’t eaten any of it yet. Stay safe kids
The first time I made something was when I made mashed potatos and I added 1 cup of salt instead of 1 tbsp
I was so sure this was going to be sponsored by one of those recipe diy subscription box companies. Was not expecting a family owned apron company. Wholesome surprise
Bruh, I’m starting to wonder if I’m “naturally” good at cooking. There has been only 3-5 times I’ve messed up in about 4 years of cooking on my own (starting cooking on my own at around 8)

My grandma makes BANGIN green bean casserole!
Green 👏🏻 bean 👏🏻 casserole 👏🏻
I have a scar on my left hand from a peeler. I tried to peel a apple with a peeler as a kid once and somehow I managed to peel a good chunk of skin off and now there’s a scar there reminding me what have I done

Beautiful video dear 🌹👍🏼
Love food and cooking , had a history of it  From when I was aged 2-5 I did- putting my doll in the oven - burned the kitchen cloth and burned my brother's hand.. 2020-2021 .. I burned my arm and plastic....BUT I AM LEARNING. ( In my school (yr7-??) We don't cook all the time it has to be writtin work too.... GOD I NEED TO COOK MORE
do you know that they put you as the biggest pic in the homepage?
we have something like those moza balls in serbia, its called knegle, but it aint a sponge, it is just a ball with no holes, and has the best texture i ever tried.

Ok i am brave enough i am going to make fried chicken rn
I like how there is a small shoto face on the fridge from my hero academia
butthole on the airplane
I added 2 sticks of butter instead of 2 cups to banana bread and basically fried it :)
I turn on the stove and immediately jump back cause the flame decided to try give me a high five or something.
We thank you for the support and encouragement
Hey I told my mom to cook Mazo and it was delicious thank you for the recipe
PePpa WhaT aRe yOu doINg iN mY SoUp.  That killed me 😂😂
Wow
you  need chief Ramsey yelling at you to help you out  you need a challenge make some Indian food
Taxes taste like paper and ink
I forgot to put in the baking powder thingy into the cookie batter when I was supposed to so I added it in later and then the cookies tasted bad, DO NOT ADD SOMETHING YOU WRRE SUPPOSED TO ADD EARLIER LATER
illy: telling us about cooking safety and other stuff she doesn't know as an adult  me a child who just got accepted into a baking competition: 👁👄👁
I saw the Jujutsu Kaisen reference 👍👍
That peeler part put some very bad imagery in my head 😰
What the heck, YouTube, I have notifications on, why did I find this under a completely unrelated video two days after this was released.
I once set my hair on fire putting bread in the oven...
This is amazing I cannot even explain.
Illy making *Green bean* casserole  Also illy: the mane ingredients are *GREEN-BEANS*  Me: wow I would have never guessed that          *im kidding illy I love you*
solved world hunger, free human meat
Congrats on trending!
me who thinks I could make it on my own in the world because I know how to use a toaster
1:01 I will now be singing the song whenever I make soup
1:01  NO ONE'S GONNA TALK HOW IMPRESSIVE THAT WAS
1:01 someone should make a remix of this
👍yeah👍 it’s good da video is good
I’m sure you cook just a bit better than most

Green bean Carroll is yum!
HOW DARE YOU! NOTHING IS MORE SOUTHERN THAN AUSTRALIA!!
I lost it when she sang injury time
"me and my gf from australia," Hey, those are my people! illy supporting a small business is just so wholesome
I was looking for a video to listen to while I was cooking and this was the first thing on my page  So I sat down and happily let my stirfry burn while I watched this
When she said go to your international isle a little part of my soul died. There is not a store anywhere near me that has this magical isle I always hear so much about. Guess I dont get to have motza ball soup 😭😭
I'm gonna assume she can make sandwiche with like egg and sausage the real good food
Glad I found I this channel! Keep up the great work
I think the funny part about this is I was following along and stoped to remember I went to culinary school and I know all of this, why am I following along😭
As a southerner myself I can confirm.... this is a lie. No one here like the green bean casserole either.
So basically when cooking go against every instinct you have.
Peppa what r you doing in the bacon soup :)
Congratulations on trending!!
Yo mazz going YuCKY wUcKy  Lol
It's Passover now and i just finished helping my mom make matzo balls (if that's how u say it in English) and was like. Let's see what's happening on YouTube! And the first thing i saw was your video! I really enjoyed it.
Green Been Casserole done right Is TOP TIER. Cooking is actually quite easy. Baking on the other hand, is quite difficult. Believe it or not, the best recipes can be found on food. Campbell's cream of mushroom has a great recipe for GBC on the can. BUT don't be afraid to tweak or modify recipes, as the result can be better than the OG. If the imperial measurements of teaspoon and tablespoon annoy you, use metric. Barry Lewis is a great food channel here on the Tube. He even has recipes for just Microwave based meals
i like how the message of this video is the same as ratatouille
Oikii
My equivalent of matzo ball soup is probably fishcakes
7:57 Thanks for the Reference to that Remmy the rat of all my freams meme from TikTok! Surely
Ooof
Illy: The first time I cooked was in college Me: *cooks eggs and bacon at 12 y.o.*
Electric Stoves do not click cause they do not need to ignite the flame to cook!
Here I am with my pb and j sandwiches 🥪 and no idea how to cook.
6:45 That would be a cool Minecraft soundtrack
So I’m not from the South, I’m actually from the MidWest, but as a kid one of the only ways I’d eat Green Beans without complaining was in Green Bean Casserole; and let me tel you I LOVED it... still do if it’s cooked right. I’m sorry the recipe you used didn’t turn out right, I’ve had that happen to me with a few things I’ve tried to make.  Side not: Masa ball soup sounds good, I’m not sure if I’ve had it or not but now I want it darn you.
OMG NOW 1 DAY OMGGG
2:55 is when the ~sAfEtY sTuFf~ ends lol
We have green bean casserole every thanksgiving and I made some for last year!! (It was yummy
JUJUTSU KAISEN OMG
ok but like, all the anime references in the background though... you need to make a video about anime
GREEN BEEN CASSEROLE HELL YEAH!!!!!!!! That is BY FAR my favorite part of thanksgiving 👌
ily: you can add your own image to the apron  me, adding an PNG of a toaster to mine
Illy: Can't use sharp objects without an accident Me: Learned to use knives and peeling at 9 years old.
I am Norwegian and all I need to cook (seasoning) is salt, pepper and ketshup. Oh! And remember to use butter (a lot)!
The only this I know how to bake is brownies from a box also muffins and sugar cookies also from a box 😂 but I’m still living with my family soooo
Thx
What s maza..bowl?
Green bean casserole is delicious         I hate pepper
You should try making macaroons (the coconut ones not French ones, those are super hard) sometime- they’re really easy and delicious! Also matzo ball soup is so good!
I fricking love your artstyle
I did not think "ew, green bean! in a casserole!" I thought "oh, you're that kind of person"
I also once cut my finger but I cut off my entire finger and cut my other finger
Ainme person 😁 👏👏👏👏 not in a bad way
I'm not afraid of turning my stove on because my stove wont blow up if I do it wrong
“Peppa, what are you doing in my soup”  Dang I thought we could add anything in there lmaooo
Jesus I relate to this so much
Matzo ball soup just in time for Passover! 💛
Motza ball soup just in time for Passover!
If I'm making anything on the stove or in the oven I stay there with my eye like super vision until it was done :]
The first time i tried baking i brunt the whole thing and it was a literal rock.
oh my god the promised neverland reference O.O
Was that shoto on the fridge 🔥❄️
number 19 on tending good job keep up the good work
lol, I wish the peppaaaaa~ joke came back
not me thinking that the apron she was wearing was a bunch of middle fingers
Ah, yes, the oven gloves! (English is my only language except for the English word for oven gloves because for some reason the Finnish word is the default for my family)
Illy: Matzo Ball Soup— Me, a Hotel Transylvania fan: MONSTER BALL SOUP—  I didn’t know that the soup existed and now I get the joke :)
YOHANAN(JOHN/JUAN) 14:6 "I AM THE WAY AND THE TRUTH AND THE LIFE. NO ONE COMES TO THE FATHER EXCEPT THROUGH ME" "YO SOY EL CAMINO Y LA VERDAD Y LA VIDA. NADIE VIENE AL PADRE SINO POR MI"........
Soup time will be stuck in my head now *forever*

This is fate like a week ago i started cooking for the first time
I'm still afraid to use them microwave probably cause I once ruined my microwave by putting a pop tart in it with the wrapper on it    All I wanted was a pop tart why?
I'm not a good YouTube but I'm trying so we all have something similar heck I'm bad at cooking ;-;
Band kid 😐, go play sports instead
I'm trying to learn how to make sauce. That's my cooking goal for now. If I can manage that, I can just fry some meat and vegetables and cook some rice. Then I have several different dishes where I can vary type of meet, the vegetables and the sauce but essentially the cooking process is the same
I would sacrifice my limbs to watch another illymation video
Tabbes is the bestz
For all of you Jewish people in the comments knowing what she was talking about with those yummy matzo balls
When the video is trending below *GORDON RAMSAY*

Once I misread  1/4 spoon of salt as 1/4 cup of salt..... I had to throw away my brownies...
Just placed an order for a apron and some mittens! Can’t wait to get them😋
my parents walking in on me watching illy talk about balls for 5 minutes like  👁  👄  👁
This should’ve been sponsored by hello fresh lmao  Ik its kinda against the video’s encouragement of cooking but it would’ve just been funny
*Hey, to you reading* .... you are loved in this moment, just as you are, here's how we know: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”
4:36 Jujutsu Kaiden 1st years I see you 😏😏
P
im 11 but my grandma teaches me how to cook so i dont starve
once I halved a cookie recipe but I didn't half the amount of sugar by accident, not that it mattered because I forgot to substitute Fahrenheit degrees for celsius and ended up with a pile of ash o_O
?
Ahhhhh we got a Maaz cameo!
I once forgot to put eggs in my cupcake batter. They were still edible, but tasted like cookies.
10:30 at night and the algorithm dropped me here....nice
I still remember the first time I made spaghetti, I somehow accidentally made the sauce sweet and spicy at the same time. lol
One time I was making cookies and I put them in the oven. They just started melting into a liquid. It turns out I put baking soda in instead of baking powder 🤦‍♀️
I f***** up brownies you might be asking how do you do that it was a box. I never used before I think it's just how the the recipe is I told my mom to not buy this brand again he bought it when covid-19 hit my area and yeah we bought two boxes and they both ended up a total fail think a mix of fudgy and cake like and sticky
One answer: in 3rd grade I invented “ deep fried retried bean balls”
my takeaway from this video:  people put knives in the dishwasher????
I just finished binging your videos so perfect timing!
Waiting for the JuJutsu Kaisen comments 😐
I am going to sing "soup time, soup time" all the time. I am going to annoy everyone.
Sooooo whose making "Soup Time" into a remix I can dance to?💃🏿🕺🏿
Oooh, I added at 1/2 tablespoon of salt to a pumpkin pie instead of a 1/2 tsp once and the pie was soooooo salty. Why do tsp and tbsp look so similar?!? It happens to all of us at some point or another.
Lmaooo                0                    O                       O                        O                       ○                      ○                    °                   °

Idk how but my dad while in the kitchen loses big chucks of his fingers!! He’s a great cook, but I think he’s part lizard or something because they grow back like it was NOTHING! And then I lost a chuck of my thumb, and after a few weeks it grew back. Idk wt hecc is going on but... I guess we are lizard people.

Also this is the most free and loose and creative of any of your videos. watching this was pure joy.
Nobody: Absolutely nobody: Me:5 yr/o using sharp knifes without adult supervision in the kitchen.(I have never cut myself with a knife even when I was 5,but uh idk why I was making food that involves cutting for my mom at 5,I think she was always busy and wanted to teach me young,well it worked I’m an amazing cook!I make cakes and food I’m thinking on making a website to sell them!
Technique creates flavor: not ingredients
Me eating soup and rice: mhm

If you sponsored crunchy roll for this video...           Let's not go through that lane againn
Keep on trying
Bro this video is the best animated yt video I have ever seen
The sign in the grocery store said grace field meat and I just-
Haven’t had matzo ball soup BUT the texture you’re talking about ik from eating chicken and dumpling soup
Did you give an airplane a butthole?? Is this what quarantine does??
Who else got the powerpuffs reference in the beginning? Sugar, spice, and chemical X? Just me.. Ok
A moment Gordon Ramsey would be proud of: 7:02
Awww Funny Aprons put your picture on their site. So sweet. I want one with my parrot on it.
I love your videos! Keep em coming!
Kinda a cooking story I guess but one day I was doing a stupid child thing and was trying to put a wooden skewer through the center of an apple I don't know ok but I wasn't watching where my fingers were and I think you know where this is going but I tried to force it through and ended up skewering my finger
I love how you love matzoh balls it’s part of my Culture and I feel like it gets ignored a lot so I just want you know it made my day hearing that my favorite Youtuber loves a part if my culture
4:53 do u see the todoroki magnet
*Lol, new subscribers!* 💟🐰💟🐇💟🐣💟🥚💟
I learned how to cook by reading an old Boy Scout handbook printed in the 1950s (Handbook for Boys 5th Edition). I found it for less than $10 at the local bookstore a number of years ago.
your awesome keep going. hope this comment makes you feel nice 😊👍
A no-fail roast baby potato (works with other veggies too): 425F°, 20-35 mins in oven (until crispy as desired). Wash and dry veg. Slice potatoes in half, other veg same size, into a large bowl. Toss veg in oil or melted butter to coat, along with ~2Tablespoons worth of your favourite spice blend.   (I like: salt, garlic, onion, pepper, thyme, rosemary, oregano, and chili flakes, but u do u boo boo)   This is a really great video! It heartens me to see creators prioritize their health over 'the hustle'- we need more of that in our lives, I think. 🌻
this might be one of the best, funniest, and most relatable videos I have ever seen this year. you're awesome keep going 😊👍
Are't we gonna talk about how She sings so beutifully....
Shoot todo roll
A few months ago I went to five guys and out of the corner of my eye , I saw this lady. She had orange hair and glasses but the thing is - she looked identical to the pictures I’ve seen of illymation. Even though it might not have been her, I still wonder to this day if it happened to be. Anyways, have a good rest of your day/night!
The only thing I cook is 2 minute noodles but everything else is from Menulog

Entertaining content and adorable products! They suited each other perfectly~
One time I accidentally used salted butter instead of unsalted butter for pancakes, so I straight up drowned the pancakes in maple syrup to balance out the salt.
Hey illy if the best meal in the south has green beans then the south has never herd of mcdonald's burger 🍔🍗🍟🍕🌮🌯🥧🍢🍦🍘🥠🍫🍨🍧🍱🍪🍩🍰🍿🎂⚫⚪⚫🍪🥞🥐🥨🥛🍯🍬🍭🍮🍙 anything is better than green beans

Illy’s dream meal must be Mac sticks and matzo ball soup
Are you Jewish? I know that matzo ball soup is a passover food
When u live in a country with like no culture so they have no matzo ball mix  *sad*
I LIVE FOR ANIME REFERENCES IN HER VIDEOS PLS THE JUJUSTU KAISEN ONES AA😩😩😩🙏🙏🙏
Me: Anime is bad Also me: OMG THATS A FMA REFERENCE. HUMONCULI!!!!!!!!?!?!?
Being Jewish, your gushing over matzah ball soup (we call it Kandel normally ate on the holiday pesach which is soon ) makes me so happy lol. Hope all your friends enjoyed it!
Uhhh I ALWAYS mix up the teaspoons and tablespoons!
DID YOU ATLEAST PUT BACON
2:10  Awwww man I wish I was a cartoon character
3:40  Green bean casserol is good  Ive had it once.          I think
Your #17 on trending! 🙃
Green bean casserole is my fav and I Rarely get to eat it and it’s weird that the one time I’ve messed one up was overpeppering it. It tastes spicy for some reason
yk what is hard? painting your nails with your SHAKY hand, thats real hard 😭
I've done the pepper thing before but with.. salt. I've also accidentally mistaken my MSG for Sugar.. worst cup of coffee ever.....
OMG same i also got cut with a peeler.. more times then i care to mention..
I’m getting Camp Camp vibes👀...
I am defiantly not the best at cooking but I do really enjoy baking! How do yall feel about it? Also amazing animations as usual Illy! This vid was rlly funny!
My first dish was gnocchi! it’s delicious and easy!
I made the soup wow im great a cooking
Ok, I have 15 years of experience in professional kitchens, and I approve this tutorial. Also important how to correctly hold the knife, but that's for another video.
Ive been cooking since i was 5 if not starvation was the other option.
I love the JJK photo its really cool and i want to know how you animate that
Yes indeed.
Okay but why is soup time an absolute BOP
this video is really amazing illy, we love that u r back , and will continue supporting u
u should do a whole video of u cooking
If you want more cooking ideas that tastes good, search chicken puff pastry. My family loves it.
Matzo ball soup is actually a traditional Jewish food for Passover it’s delicious I usually make it from scratch I highly recommend it I love it
Watch out for gorden ramse he will make fun of your food and also have you ever make cake
LOL at my country we eat matzo ball soup at a holiday, the holiday name is psah
I always love looking for all the anime references in the background😊

I had no idea green bean casserole wasn't a thing everyone had as a kid! I always hated it, but only because I hate green beans with a passion.
Did you not cook in school?
no but really green bean casserole is really good
5:34 OH MY GOD TODOROKI IS ON RHE FRIDGE!!!!
PePa WhAt ArE YoU DoInG iN mY SoUp?!                    ♥️I love that!♥️
Where’s the full music video for the soup time song? That’s was kinda fire 🔥
Easy recipe here. (Peanut butter cookies) 1 cup peanut butter. 1 cup sugar. 1 egg. Mix all together. Bake at 325 for 12 minutes. Let cool and serve. Easy as making a bowl of cereal.  Note......if you taste the mixer raw, it tastes just like reese's pieces. Add chocolate if you wanna eat it raw. Reese's Pieces rip you off.
ROLF, Oh my goodness, how am I just now finding you! This is hilarious!
matzo ball soup = soup with găluşte?
Respect. I’m almost 30 and I barely know how to cook.
I am confused about what is considered a "soup crime"
Hi Illy you are my animation inspiration I love your videos so so so so much ✨🥺❤️
Love the thumbnail!
5:10 IS THAT A TODAROKI STICKER
I love Matzo ball soup!
Keep in mind, EVERYONE SHOULD WATCH JUJTSU KAISEN BECAUSE IF YOU DONT, YOU ARE A MENACE TO SOCIETY
It's ok potato i'll always love you even if no-one else does
4:46 Megumi, Nobara and Yuji in the back are reminding me there's only 1 JJK episode left :(
I Left after when the guy said yucky wucky
it's nice that you give us this matzah ball soup recipe right before pesach(passover) 💙
This reminded me of this one time I accidentally stabbed myself. I was trying to get the tomatoes of my frozen pizza (i like tomatoes, just not on pizza or well fried tomatoes in general), and since they were frozen, they were stuck on the pizza pretty well. So I was using scissors to get the tomatoes off. And then my hand slipped and the scissors went straight to my arm. And now i have a scar because of that.  Honestly at first I was panicking a bit, but after a while I just started laughing at how stupid that injury is.
Love the Todoroki sticker on the fringe
i know how to cook
About the kids. Yeah, Connie got turned into meat
I just love how illy puts different anime things in her back rounds. I just love that ✌🏾
OMG there is a Todoroki magnet on the fridge!!! im freaking out 😂 i love My hero academia
10 of the World's Funniest One Liners  1. On the other hand, you have different fingers. 2. I've only been wrong once, and that's when I thought I was wrong. 3. God made mankind. Sin made him evil. 4. I don't find it hard to meet expenses. They're everywhere.  5. Be nice to your kids. They'll choose your nursing home. 6. Gravity: It's not just a good idea, it's the LAW! 7. It's lonely at the top; but you do eat better. 8. I don't suffer from insanity; I enjoy every minute of it. 9. Always go to other people's funerals, or they won't go to yours.  10. You can't have everything; where would you put it?  Editorial: Probably the most thought-provoking one-liner is "Eat right. Stay fit. Die anyway." It's sad but true -- no matter what you do, you will die. This is because you have sinned against God. Let's see if that's true: Have you ever lied (even once)? Ever stolen (anything)? Jesus said, "Whoever looks upon a woman to lust after her, has committed adultery already with her in his heart." Ever looked with lust? If you have said "Yes" to these three questions, by your own admission, you are a lying, thieving, adulterer at heart; and we've only looked at three of the Ten Commandments. How will you do on Judgment Day? Will you be innocent or guilty? You know that you will be guilty, and end up in Hell. That's not God's will. He provided a way for you to be forgiven. He sent His Son to take your punishment: "God commended His love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us." Jesus then rose from the dead and defeated death. God promises everlasting life to all those who confess and forsake their sins, and trust in Jesus Christ. Please do that today . . . you may not have tomorrow. See John 14:21 for a wonderful promise. Then read the Bible daily and obey what you read. God will never let you down.

One question. How do you use a dishwasher? I never used one. I wash my dishes by hand
Story   about Pokémon
But you didn’t cook MAC STICKS!!!
One doesn’t experience self-transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates🎈
i put salt instead of sugar in a cake
Illy did you tone your voice down because of Sasha from aot at 6:16? (sorry in advance 🥲)
In México a taco is just meat or anithing in a tortilla
I love to cook.....well I’m trying to still cook 😂
I recommend watching Adam ragusea he’s a good cook that optimizes his videos for the home cooks.
You may not be able to cook but you sure can sing
My older sister once tried boiling milk in a kettle. The smell still lingers at the very back of my nostrils...
Don't eat the grace field meat.
If you ever feel bad about cooking just remember Gordon Ramsay can't cook a grilled cheese
I SEE ITADORIIII 😍😍
6:20 Illy has made the transition of insane dad jokes that only she finds humorous.
Just turned 18 last week and am not ready to be a young adult yet :0
I started cooking at 9
Just turned 18 last week and am not ready to be a young adult yet :0

when you did many cooking crimes:(
Wait yoi cook food  You dont order it?
Hey, if anyone's curious, homemade milk tea is actually pretty easy! It's not really as good as store bought but eh.  Just get some tea you like, preferably green tea I think. If you use tea leaves and not the packets, use a tea strainer and add a few pinches.  Then pour in boiled water or hot water and let it sit for a bit.  Make sure there's enough room in the cup for milk and stuff.  Add milk to your taste, I like adding cream too. The SUGAR is what makes the milk tea taste good. Add enough of it!!!  If you want to you can also buy some boba, popping pearls can be bought on amazon and you can just scoop it in, tapioca pearls can also be bought on amazon, just microwave them with water till they float to the top, they won't be the best quality in the microwave but stoves scare me. And then pour out the water and pour it in your cup.  In my experience the milk tea looks really pale, I'm not sure how they make it so green or brown. But it tastes great :D There aren't measurements in this, just add stuff little by little till you like it, add some milk and taste it, add some sugar and taste it.
This is more useful than cooking class in school.
Illy what are u doing in my youtube reccomended
So happy your back!! The matzo ball soup looks and sounds amazing!!
1:43- WHEN YOU PAUSED AND SAID COOKING CRIME MY CAT WOKE UP AND STARED AT THE SCREEN
Am I the only one who noticed the todoroki fridge magnet in the background
when she changes the thumbnail but you already saw the original one
אני יודע שזה בעיברית אבל אם את רואה את זה היום מחר בערב את צריכה לאוכול קניידלך (כדורי מצה ) כי מחר ערב פסח ואוכלים את זה מחר מלא יהודים והיה מצחיק כזה וכיף
dont worry, i will take your full supply of Matzo Balls. since i cant cook
"watch the pepper" AND THE SALT pleaseeeeee watch the salt it causes trauma😃
thats weird, ive never even scraped myself w a peeler. maybe mine isnt sharp
When your better 1% better at cooking than your favorite youtuber: I am finally better at something than someone!
W-why does lily want my fingers
is that a karasuno jacket at 2:34?
I am not the only one who goes crazy when I see the mha stuff in the video
One time i held a small knife upside down and when i pressed my thumb down i cut it
The way she said potato made me think was she thinking of Sasha?
@illymations why is there a hamoncoulous (I'm pretty sure I spelled that horribly wrong but whatever) magnet on your fridge ? Are you trying to tell us something?
2:28  Furry confirmd.
I love all the background anime references 😌❤️
Joe
Gonna peel the potato  **slice**   .......Or my finger
As a 15 years old and almost always cook have never cut my hand before
So funny
UwU =^= 0^0
Man! I gotta say this was a masterpiece. I had to rewatch it because the first time I was looking at all the backround anime references. 😁
I was eating bacon while watching this
2:10 OHHHHHHHHH in the background
"Oh, come on! It can't be that bad!"
Sad sad
We NEED a full version of the soup time song
This was posted on my birthday XD
matzo ball soup reminds me of albondigas!!
I really scared at using the knife but after watching this video, I STILL scared of using knife.
Illy ily
When people come in my house: Them: wheres your dishwasher? Me, an asian: i AM the fckin dishwasher
The last time I tried to cook was... uh... if baking counts, it was a year or two ago, I think? Otherwise... I can't remember. At least five. I've been considering trying again recently, but I don't exactly have the resources to cook. For one thing, I have 0 pots or pans. For another, the only really cookable ingredient I have is eggs. No seasoning. Not even salt. Just... eggs. I do know a lot of theory behind simple cooking - I binge-watch Worst Cooks in America rather often and actually considered starting it again last night, though I ultimately decided against it. But I just don't do the actual cooking itself.
I added a fourth cup of salt instead of a fourth teaspoon to my muffins once. I was crying so hard lol, my brother took a bite and pretended that they weren't so bad- he was so sweet hahah
I love all of your content this was great!!!!!<3
Maaz: makes the matzo balls too big Illy: you have lost your life privileges
Fun fact: Illy was first, not you
You’re on trending!
3:47 does this mean u said the n word?
It says something that I’m so conditioned to sponsorships that I was absolutely waiting for a “THEN YOU NEED SKILLSHARE” at the start, lol
When you make grilled cheese that tastes good. Then I remember how I put a mountain of butter on each slice to make it taste good...
Genuinely so glad a YouTube is out here educating people what to not put in a dishwasher. I’ve had so many college roommates ruin nice cooking knives 🥲
I am a living agent of chaos.  An ambassador of evil if you will.  An eldritch being of darkness and discord if you feel so inclined.   So lemme buy one of dem aprons rq.
As a kid some how I always end up getting paper cuts even when i wasn't even using or if I even wasn't around paper. {:[
Shit you better get good cuz I wanna sandwich by the end of the night
I absolutely adore the Luigi apron!!!
One time I was making peanut butter cookies and I the dough was so hard so I had to make it all over again
No one: Absolutely no one: Illy's friend: yA tHaTs A lOt Of PePeR mAn Edit: thanks for all the likes I never get more then 4 likes
I'm 12 and I know how to cook ten poor Illy XD
Peeps has risen from the dead
When you’re chopping try to use a slide/lift motion where you keep the tip of the knife to the cutting board. Avoid lifting and bring down the knife a lot. It’s less noisy and it’s safer and faster
Todoroki
How can i cook if im afraid of fire?
"copy of the golden web" search it

Go to master chef XD
I did the pepper thing but with baking soda in cookies ^^; now I read the recipe 3 times before I add anything.
It tasted good okey green beans casserole
I've been cooking a lot of Gumbo from my Dad lately. Each time I cook it, I feel like I'm getting a bit better.
congrats on trending
Im 21 and ofc I know how to cook but I find this so cute i have to use this to teach my younger siblings 🥺❤️💯
You don't know *how many times* I've messed up microwave brownies. Like, what the heck is a tablespoon?! Putting vanilla in a cup is like putting mercury in a paint. God, I'm a teen, and I barely know how to make eggs and spaghetti. That's it!
when she said patatoes.... sasha?
Thank you for adding jujutsu kaisen to your backgrounds
PEPPA
Its Friday Then, Its Saturday Sunday What?!
Tweet Gordon Ramsay your Food
No one:  Illy: THINK OF THE CHILDREN
Looks like we found a new Hell's Kitchen  Contestant
kneidlach (matzo balls) soup is what you eat in the Seder in Passover. Great timing with the video!
Repent of your sins and turn to God, for the kingdom of Heaven is near. Matthew 3:2  Jesus loves you!  = ) Never give up on your life!!
Making chocolate chip cookies one day I misread the sugar and salt parts so I flipped the two ingredients and added waaaaaay too much salt
Wtf is a casserole 😂
Girl you should make chocolate lasagna-it’s eAsY and fUn to make
THERE IS A TODOROKI MAGNET ON THE FRIDGE
I have a dish that is fun and easy to make. 1: put an egg or 2 in a bowl and scramble it 2: mix some oatmeal in 3: fry it in a pan :3
As a full grown man that can only make a good grill cheese...*thank you*
All Jewish kids know the joy of matzo ball soup on Passover  :D
That Yuuji in cookbook and jjk first year trios on wall tho ❤️
Most wholesome video
I'm actually a really great cook I have been cooking and making meals and even baking since I was five and only have gotten better as I got older
I'm aware the original is like Shakira or something, but Alyssa's "Soup time" just reminds me of "group hang" from crazy ex girlfriend
7:49 that Jujutsu Kaisen tho.
YouTube's notification is doing a great job at notifying me
Wait green bean casserole isnt everywhere? Also worcestershire  sauce is great in it.
Wait a minute, Illy how do you know the taste of Taxes?
I'm 11 and I love cooking my signature dish is avacado toast
Truth. I sucked at cooking and still have some upsets with new recipes I am better than when I was in my twenties
just watch food wars and you'll learn how to cook instantly
Me who's been cooking since I was 7: how do you not know how to cook
it’s just me who saw Itadori there?!?  and there’s a recipe of his meatballs  the ones he taught fushiguro  and there’s a frame with all of them there too ahhhhhhhhhh this video is just perfect
Yesterday when I was making dinner I BURNT PLASTIC ŤwŤ
I can’t tell you how many times I’ve cut myself in the kitchen 😩
I can't get past the eyebrows on the hair.
WHEN YOU SAID GREEN BEAN CASSEROLE IT WENT TO AN AD OF “THE UNHOLY” WHICH STARTED WITH A STATUE OF THE VIRGIN MARY IM SORRY IT WAS REALLY FUNNY
TODOROKI ON A FRIDGE!?
Green bean casserole doesn’t just apply to the south. Every thanksgiving you would always finding your mom telling you to take just one serving of it because it’s “yucky” to you
Finally 😭😭
I think you will feel kind of emberassed but i'm 12 (soon 13) and i know how to cook... 😅 I actually love to cook :}
Soup Crime Tiime!
“And I was going to make GREEN BEAN CASSEROLE.” Ad: A WATERY GRAVE IS WHAT YOU DESERVE-
Keep on cooking boo. Hopefully one day I'll get to try your Matzo ball soup aye
I will DEFINITELY TRY the MATZO BALL SOUP!!!
all the anime references in the back lol. i like chicken with matzaballs
Well illy its time to go to nailed it or failed it
20 hours
Random side note!   10:19  IT’S FREAKING RAE DUNN
"Imagine noodles as a sponge" so basically ramen noodles
I agree eat different foods as foods as I dont care who you are you cant eat the same thing over and over as it might affect you sometimes with migraines or things that you might not get depending on things thats happened to you before Criticism 1. As actual cook who also didany things on the first try as well as watch gordon ramsey... ramsay? Either way I watched many chefs so curling your fingers in might be good for safety but when it comes down to it it's better off to use your eyes and not your bent fingers 2. You had him act like a kid
7:50 jujutsu no kaizen NICE 👍
I have been teaching my husband how to cook with Hello Fresh for the last few months, because I always was the chef in the family and my disability is making it harder and harder. It's been so much fun 😁
If you are walking around with a knife, hold it on your side with the blade facing behind you. Be careful with the handle of what crockery you are using on the stove cause you don't wanna risk a chance of bumping into it and dropping the hot food.
We need 10hr+ clips of your calming voice YEP
Don't worry my mom's friend once came over for thanksgiving once made greenbean casserole and it almost killed all of us. We won't let her down for that but honestly it was scary.
Cattattoui
Congratulations on getting vaccinated!
I like that you are so Passionate about, random things.
I cut my finger when cutting bread for my Popcorn chicken
I started getting better at cooking and wanting to cook when I realised I might enjoy it if I made things that I would enjoy eating.  And I want an apron so much!
Me either, me either 😌✌
The anime references were emaculate
Kinda taste like taxes... Trump: *i will never taste that*
Lol Im fourteen and I don't know how to cook bc my mum never let me use the stove for some reason, thank you for safety tips I bet you will learn do make many wonderous dishes in practice ^^  Awesome vids btw your upbeat personality and humor makes me love watching these
The "PePpA, wHAt ArE yOu doInG In mY SOUp?"   Words cant Express how great that was..
1:21 Kitchen= knives is EXTREMELY acurate
Yukihira Soma liked this video.
I literally have to issue out an apology video every time I cook.
Cooking tip. MSG is salt on crack
🌱Don't worry this is all relatable🌱
Her videos give me nostalgia from Adventure time one ever friends...duh duh duh duh duh , I love it
Plz do a cook episode!!!
i have some extreme cooking classes in my highschool ( not even as a side class ITS A MAIN CLASS) and well thanks to that I know how to not burn stuff and season properly xD so yeahhhhhh.
No
pretty good video
I don't remember manifesting a cooking video last night while I was contemplating learning to cook? 'Cause, like, I'm 16 and, according to every adult female in my life "old enough to know the ways of the house" and, as much as I like defying the patriarchy, knowing how to make that beef empadão (it's a like a Portuguese version of a casserole) my granny makes every time I'm sad, is a good thing.
Am band from the kitchen
Anyone know the calm music on the soup part
3:15 pastha with no sauth?
All hail matzo ball soup 🍲
That Western accent though ... 🤠
I was supposed to add one clove of garlic to the meatballs. I used a head of garlic. BAD TIMES.
I lost 1 finger for using a butcher knife

I have no object permanence so if I look away it no longer exists. Long story short baking didn't go well for me...
Me going into pure horror when she said she uses a mix and not kosher flour
Mmmm tasty taxes :P
You sing so well! Loved the soup musical !! ❤️❤️
I’ve never done this before
f i n g e r s
Cute video.😂😂 But jokes aside  How don't people know how to cook though? The ideal age to start learning how to cook is 13/14. That's the time where you are aware enough to use kitchen utensils, ingredients and a stove or fire.😂
i cant cook even if i tried i don't know why i don't ask all might to cook for me lol
I'm about to get me some baking gloves
Another aspect of cooking is also to clean your food by giving them a rinse of water, cause I make sure no bacteria gets in the food, another aspect is frying and believe me you'll be in fear when you start frying sure there's a variety to fry but the kind I'm talking about is pan frying and believe me it is gonna sting a lot and a lot of running water washing down where the cooking oil hits some where from your body, your hands, forearms, head, cheek, neck, and worst of all your eyes and believe me I had that experience 3 or 4 times but you just gotta suck it up and endure what the hot oil offers ya ^^  Another thing is that you have to also know the fire control something I learned when it first started cooking  You see depending which food you cook you have to know the size of the fire   In general if it is big full on fire your actually gonna cook the food more quickly but down side is that you have to actually be very attentive to the food you cook  This also applies to low heat cause it depends what experience you have when it comes to using the stove  Another is that you need to use your nose and taste buds  And some situations where you need you to use your ears, to put an example is frying yes were back to frying cause there is one moment when you need to know if it the sizzles sound lowered it might be a sign you actually burned the food or you probably cooked it right depending on how attentive you are  Seriously though if your not attentive get ready to play the song hells stew from yakuza 7 which I love that song cause even some may know the context of that song it helps me get pumped up when I want to cook or when the food is done ^^  I may not have Make sense but I hope it does ^^
A sharp knife is safer then a dull knife
It’s Hanukkah tomorrow and I’m not religious but matsa ball soup always reminds me of family, and it’s so cozy 😌❤️
Me sharpening knife  My mum: you’ve been sharpening that knife for nine days now
The JJK poster in the back!!!
Just subscribed you are AWESOME
What's the music in the chill part?
I'm so good at cooking that i can set the house on fire by just stepping in the kitchen
It's great that more "young people" (I'm 31) are getting back to cooking. Cooking is incredibly creative and fun :) here's one of my favorite recipes. It's super easy, cheap, and filling:   You need: pasta of your choice (i use whole grain); 400g cherry tomatos (or more); 2 big bell peppers (any color you like); 2 glasses of a green pesto you like (store bought); 500g of chicken breast OR smoked/fried tofu OR seitan;  1. Cook pasta of your choice. A whole pack (500g).  2. Chop 2 bell peppers into cubes (i prefer red or yellow, but you can also take orange or green, whatever you like). 3. Chop cherry tomatoes into halves or quarters (about 400g or more if you want). 4. Put the veggies and the cooked pasta in a large bowl or pot. 5. Chop the chicken breast into bite-size pieces or prepare the tofu/seitan.  6. Fry the chicken breast or tofu or seitan. Make sure the chicken breast is cooked all the way through! Chicken should NOT be pink on the inside!! (Maybe add a little salt and pepper to whatever you're frying but it's not necessary if you don't like a lot of pepper or salt in your food) 7. Throw chicken/tofu/seitan into the large bowl/pot with everything else.  8. Add the two glasses of pesto and mix well while everything is still hot/warm.  9. DONE.   You will not be able to eat the whole thing but that's okay. Once the bowl/pot is cooled down, you can store the food in the fridge for up to 3 or 4 days. It's also a very easy meal to take with you to work. And it's healthy: it has lean protein, fiber, vitamins from the raw veggies, fats, and carbohydrates for fullness.   You can adapt this base with anything you like, too. I also make this same recipe with pasta as a base, but i put broccoli and chicken in, and I season eveything with olive oil, balsamic vinegar, and salt and pepper. Very light, very nice in the summer :)
The aisle sign at 5:50 tho... 😨
PEPPA LMAOOOO
YOU REWEASED THIS ON MY BOWTHDAY IWWY, THANK YOU FWIEN :)
Aaawwww the JJK picture frame ❤️
Me: ha, I doubt my grocery store would even have it, searches the 2 biggest grocery stores in Australia.  Huh, they have the meal version...  Does not want to find it in its own search, Google has to do the search for it. No soup base mix in it, it looks like. I guess If I went into the city I would find one.
4:14 Come on you can do it even Itadori cheers you on
The jujitsu kaisen photo on the wall!!
I'm hungry now after watching this

Bees knees? Nah Green bean casserole is the SKELETONS BEEF WELTON
I think this lady misunderstood the meaning of ratatouille; it say at the end of the movie the line "anyone can cook" does not mean that everyone can cook, but rather a great cook can come from anyone
And that’s why I have my handwritten recipes that I copy by hand next to me that way I don’t make those mistakes but yet I still do 🤦🏼‍♀️ I helped my mom with a rib rub recipe and completely screwed it up with mixing tablespoons and teaspoons together it still tasted great but I had no idea what I did to get it to that point🤷‍♀️oops.
Laughs in how tasty asian dishes are
Implying I get birthday cake  Or even have my birthday acknowledged
BTW, as a proud Northerner - there is NO such thing as "too much pepper!" Ever. Hahaha 😅
"And they are water resistant, And they are washable" Hold up how
My girlfriend once baked an apple pie. But instead of cinnamon, she grabbed curry. It became an Indian Apple Pie.
Yes we all try which is good
Sad that today's kids don't know simple cooking recipes. Ya ya...I'm old, but I took home ec as an elective. I ended up working as a chef for a 4 star restaurant. LMAO. Dumb youngsters!!
That Papa John's reference was gold.
omg im actually having matzo ball soup this weekend! its really good
I swear you are an INFP
Wow I learned all this when I was like 8
I was literally crying yesterday because I couldn’t fucking turn on the stove and my dad was just disappointed..LIKE IT WAS SO SIMPLEEE BUT IM AFRAID ILL GET BURNED.  I have this cousin who turned 15 on February and she knows how to cook and here I am almost close to 15 not knowing anything. (She also knows how to fucking drive?!!? We live in a ranch so there’s so much space 👍) Sometimes my parents talk about her and honestly they even ACCUSED me of being jealous which is not true it’s mostly just me getting my self esteem Cruuuuuushed.
I was gonna say how’s you fuck up tacos bruh then I remembered I’m Mexican
“I know how to hold a knife know!”   *Cutely drops knife*
The thing about the stove... Is why I have a fully electric kitchen. No nat gas anywhere near me... (Except the boiler...)
I can cook 20 different food and I'm 12
Illy: 1/4 of a Tablespoon on  green bean casserole? that's too much! Me: *willingly adds over a whole damn Tablespoon for a single serving of any of my recipes*
Sheesh the animation is on point with this one
When she said "Injury time" I felt that 😔

therapist: furry Illy doesnt exist, it cant hurt u furry Illy: 2:29
No joke, I once almost burned down my house with a gas stove because before I’d only ever used an electric stove. So I didn’t light the fire, I only turned the knob and just kind of waited for it to heat up. Luckily someone else was in the house to stop me. Also luckily I can make some really bomb scrambled eggs, so it’s something
As my mom said, cooking is just experimentation. When if you follow a recipe, you think you followed it completely, but each time, it's different in some small way. That's just cooking. Also, don't be afraid to experiment in general. Wanna cook, but can't choose a recipe? Just grab stuff and cook. That's how my mom made her delicious tuna casserole and many of her recipes. Don't be afraid to try new things, especially if you aren't sure about what to do
Hell yeah cooking is so important and food brings people together!!!! funny aprons seems great also I love
Ah yes she's woman of Jujujutsu as well
8:09 Quote from the movie: Anyone Can Cook. P.S Welcome Back. Hope u enjoyed your Vay K.
Illy watched the Ratatousical. We stan
Banana shake recipe: Banana duhhh Milk Chocky milk Honey Vanilla  Put it in a blender And boo-ya it’s ready 🥤
I'm an awesome cook. My secret is to follow the golden rule: If you can get away with it, put booze in it.
Can funny aprons chip to Sweden? I would love to buy one for my mom.
I love cooking i am forced to cook i dont wanna cook anymore i hate cooking
I think I have tried mazzo balls before
I like allooot of pepper so i should like it
The biggest oops I did cooking currently was that I ignored the part where the ingredients were supposed to be low sodium and they end up being salt galore
It's good that you're learning to cook more Illy I know it takes time but the more you do it the better you'll get at preparing meals like your matzo ball soup
It’s confirmed she’s a cartoon charecter
Jews rise up!
For the same reason, I make chipped beef or loco moco
Unfortunately my mom never taught me how to cook even though she was in the kitchen every day. I probably learned more from my Dad making pancakes in the evenings on occassion than I learned from my mom cooking full meals. She basically made me paranoid about the knives, stove and oven with her overly cautioning me rather than teaching me how to use them. After I got married, I taught myself how to cook, learning from recipes online mostly and cooking shows. Unfortunately, I'm still a bit paranoid about the oven, but these days I have a real danger of falling into it because of inner ear damage meaning I live with constant, nonstop vertigo.
Lily your so amazing and funny and your videos make feel happy and positive, I like baking bagels, focaccia, and pull apart bread.... I'm kind of obsessed with bread. You should download the tasty app that's were I get all my recipes ❤️
Cooking is just trial and Error just keep on trying
im 9 but im not scared
I have loved green bean casserole!
BOI I'm a kid and I know how to use a gun
Almost makes me wish I was more of a cooking fan 😂

God matzo balls were my favorite things to have in soup, my mom made the best soups.  When I helped my mom make the mazto balls I would always snack on the batter because it was like cookie dough yummy if raw and yummy when cooked. Also to those who want to make matzo balls, take illis advice, make them half the size of a golf ball because they do grow when cooked.
the thumbnail felt like it was from the "meet arnold" channel
Even though I’m still pretty young, cooking is a big passion for me and it’s honestly really fun. I constantly cook full 4 serving meals for my family.    I just don’t like cutting onions.
Im 13 but im really good at cooking heresva recipe for you Put the amount of rice you want into a hot pan put it on medium heat and use a spatula on a non stick pan and take 2 eggs out put oil on the rice and put eggs in the rice and stir it until yellow  Cut a cucumber into small bit and cut some Tomato into small bits Cut a steak into a small slices and cook it in a pan  Then put the rice in then cucumber and Tomato and then put in the beef
Its the effort that counts
It took me time to understand that Matzah Ball soup is a Passover dish. I'm excited.
One time I was making potato and leek soup for the first time and the recipe recommended 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon of cayenne pepper...I read it as 1/4 tablespoon, and I never had worked with cayenne pepper before hand to know any better. The first sip put me into a coughing fit till I cried. Was still pretty good thou
I wish I could chill out like that soup did 😔
I'm 13 and I don't know how to make tea without spilling hot water on myself lol.
One time my brother added 2 cups to his brownies instead of 2 teaspoons
That's what I love about making soup. Like even making homemade soup you literally CANT messup on it except adding too much salt and thats hard to do   never had matzo ball soup though... i kinda wanna try it now. Minus the bits of zeldafan fingers from messing up on peeling the veggies T-T
I eat Matzo ball soup often, but my dad doesn't make it with Matzo balls anymore, so is it Matzo ball soup?
I’m going to make matzo balls and only add pepper and garlic JUST to spite you. >:)
PEPPAAAAA that’s what got me 😂😂😂☠️☠️☠️
"... and it got pockets!" das cool af
I am here for the Chaos
I appreciate how there was an ad exactly .1 second after “green bean casserole” to allow me adequate time to shriek in horror~
Was that laurenzide
Peppa what are you doing in my soup
Matzo ball soup is also a Jewish dish! That's an important aspect to acknowledge :)
Wow now I know about cooking by you there different food out there with different ways, but everyone can make food what they are comfortable like snowflake no two are alike
I know how to cook pasta salad and I'm eleven years old.
I feel good that my school does cooking lessons
I'm watching jujitsu kaisen and come watch some YouTube for a break my first. Vid and you wall pic  😂 is it

Matzo ball soup=Anything you want Anything you want=unpredictability unpredictability=Chaos   I guess you could say  IM HERE FOR THE CHAOS (soup)
Before mil
Being a college student my greatest dish is a grilled cheese sandwich, which is pretty good 80% of the time
So, my great uncle said that matzo balls are like cannonballs, except you don't die from them. I don't recall that y great aunt made particularly dense matzo balls.
Once i cut my fingers grating cheese
This video may have made me terrified of cooking
Green bean casserole is my FAVE!!!! 😋
animators can make the most boring things entertaining, it’s honestly impressing
2:28 perfect, I’m a cat
ok i have a rlly funny story that reminded me of ur pepper story. i tired making an apple pie at age 7 w/o my parents. anyway it called for 1/4 cup of sugar, but i could barely read, so i added 1/4 cup of salt
At least she's giving it her best shot!
2:30 Illy is a confirmed furry!!
Cooking is so much fun once you get the hang of it. I made my first beef Wellington at 16
That soup time song is a banger... seriously I was dancing along.
Not gonna flex: but I'm 13 and I can make my noodles ON A STOVE BEAT THAT ILLY
Ok, but jokes aside Matzo balls are DELICIOUS
Coincidentally, I watched ratatouille earlier today and now I see this on trending
🤞
DONG
This..might have inspired me to try to cook.
Super creative! Love the editing and animation!! Super cute!
E
I love your videos Illy! Keep making your videos and trying new things! ❤️
I think Remy approves of this video
THE WAY SHE SEDUCTIVELY WENT "peppa~ what are you doing in my soup~" I CANT I CANT
My cooking repertoire consists of pasta... and... couscous... and macaroni....  So I can boil water.     Then I fight for ten minutes to use a can-opener on some tomato sauce because I’m left handed and forgot to put batteries into the electric one my grandmother gave me without telling me, just stuck it in the drawer and left like she left me a cursed doll.
“BAKING GLOVES”
Matzoh balls can be WHATEVER size. It’s best when they’re the size of tennis balls. Firm on the inside, soft on the outside.
It's weird how I am better at cooking than her
TODOROKI MAGNET!!! AAHHHHH!!😍😍😍
2:10 hey it’s that transgender dude With the purple hair with the funny content just forgot their name.

Illymation uploaded PogU
Me: *has a huge phobia of knives and never goes in the kitchen when someone is cooking:*
I have a vivid memory of when me and my friends decided to make cookies. Her mom had been reorganized their kitchen, so, we used salt instead of sugar and...we tried cookies and barfed lol.
Did anyone else think that Hello Fresh was going to be the sponsor?
hi
Illy’s art style just keeps getting better
Gotta love a small Aussie business
NO PUNS IN THE KITCHEN. 🔪
JOKES ON YOU I F****KING HATE MY FINGERS
I agree. Green Bean Casserole is the bomb🔥
Itsss the sooouppp part got me 😊
I love the anime references to my hero, mob Psycho and jujutsu Kaisen
I love matzo ball soup, it is very good - a dude on the internet
John 3:16-17 16- For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.17-For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.

THE QUEEN IS BACK!!!
-see's the pepper part- ok but the funny thing is while it was to much pepper for you guys that how much my mom and sis typically put on there meals.
my friends and I once baked cake together, but forgot the sugar lmao  ...my dad actually liked it more without sugar lol
I SAW TODOROKI ON THE FRIDGE
Always make sure to protect your fingies kiddies
My dad used to own a restaurant for like 5 years, I wasn't born yet but he taught me how to make a lot of food stuff. I litterally am 10 and I know how to cook a ton of stuff.
I love your videos
Your on trending!
Wait hold on did I see the ICS logo on that character in the kitchen with the black jacket and pigtails- IS ILLY ACTUALLY A HAIKYUU FAN?!
Do not let Gordon Ramsy near this video
Did anyone notice the jujutsu kaisen picture
Was making mac and cheese oen time and my hand accidently slipped and i cut two of my knuckles with the grater since cheddar is very wet and sticks the grater.
I'm defenitely trying that soup recipe 😄  I dunno if it's still 'a thing' but I recall a few years back when the fact that a growna*s dude didn't know how to cook was seen as "cute" (the thought of people actually thinking that sends shivers down my spine to this day) and it kind of spread to becoming like a 'quirky thing' for some people. Like, cooking should be a basic skill that you're taught - if not by your parents/legal guardians - then in school. Nobody is demanding you to be able to make some obnoxiously complicated dish but you should at the very least know how to boil water for pasta or eggs or whatever. Frying some meatballs or sausages shouldn't be considered complicated since half the job is already done. I still remember when I used to date this dude who refused to learn how to cook. Why should he? He could just order takeout or get either his mommy or big sis to come cook for him. And now I was there too, so I might as we-  I purposefully made him pancakes with a buttload of salt in it and demanded he either finish every piece or grow the f*ck up, learn how to cook and stop mooching off others. He ate the pancakes. We weren't together very long after that.
its not mazo balls its monter ball supe somebody get that
Omg hearing Illy talk about Matzo ball soup made my lil semi-jewish heart explode
God bless Jesus loves you and He died for your sins and He is willing to forgive you because of His endless amount of grace, love, and mercy. Just think about it would you die for a "good person"? I know that I would not but Jesus died for you and me just complete sinners and He did it knowing that the majority of us would take it for granted. God bless Jesus loves YOU that is a fact that He has proven by dying on the cross for you fr g
I see you watch jujutsu kaisen
I watched this vid 10hr before it was posted
I request more Illycat!  For the green bean casserole, the magic ingredient is Old English Cheese. Just make sure to ask the poor supermarket clerk where it is in your store cause you will never find it. Trust me. Also, carrots and wax beans don’t hurt!  I wish it was called big spoon and little spoon. 1/2 lilspoon is a lot harder to mix up than 1/2 teaspoon anyhoo.  From, your fan who is a decade older :-3
0:29 Lol
First it was "No-No Square" and now it's "Soup Time" 😆😆😆
No worries about the pepper thing u can’t do worse then what I did I was in a food class and my group decided to make a chocolate soufflé and I was measuring ingredients while my group was.... arguing if they were doing it right (they weren’t) but in that confusion I mixed up the sugar and salt measurements so instead of 2 cups of sugar I measured 2 cups of salt. To be fair I told my group it was salt but since they were all not paying much attention they didn’t correct it either
Maz oballs
I learned the claw thing from a gordon ramsay video and eventually got a grasp of it through daily tomato dicing.
......what's wrong with potatoes?
The thing I always love about Illy’s animations it the animation style and the amount of work she puts into them, the textures and everything. She is also so funny 😆
Congrats on #8 on trending!! You’ve worked really hard and I love your videos! They always brighten my day! :) also tell Luigi and Juniper I say hi :3
did that plane have a butthole? what have you wrought upon this world.
No puns in the kitchen
Normal people: *enjoying the video* Me: *staring at the magnets on the fridge intensely*
Is this a food tutorial???
I came from Sr Pelo
Man, matzo ball soup slaps.. I totally get your vibe illy. It’s a food I’ve grown up eating, and so warm and homey.. I could go for a big heaping bowl right now..
Soup time, soup time... perfect thing to listen to light up the moood

Peppa~ what are you doing in my cereal- I mean soup~

Green bean casserole was and is the fucking staple here! Every thanksgiving you always have Green Bean casserole in the south, hands down 🙌.
Soup crimes! Yes I love this!
This video was so funny
Keep trying, you'll learn eventually!💪😊
*Furry transformation: **2:29*
one time I was making brownies and i add 1 3 cups of oil instead of tbsp
"yEa ThAsSa LoTtA pEpPeR mAn"
I love matzo ball soup! My mom made it for me a few days ago.
possibly find a new background song.  it gets to be the only thing i hear for whatever reason after a few minutes have passed and its not a good song
Illy: THINK OF THE CHILDREN. Me: yes the children I am not feeding
Just make one Matzo ball bigger than the rest and give it to your least favorite sibling. All yay fun Matzo ball soup for them until they get to the big one. And you can tell them you made it so big cause they're your favorite sibling.
"I can grew my hand back, BUT YOU CAN'T DO THAT IN REAL LIFE OKAY! Me: Are you challenging me
Matza ball soup has a really special place in my heart because I make it every Passover even if my recipe takes 3-5 hours
Nice Jujutsu Kaisen reference at 7:50.
dont worry illy i also did that peeler thing to my finger :')
I'm from Minnesota, and even I think green bean casserole is bomb
no one trusts me with sharp objects especially my close friends cuz they know my favorite MHA character is Himiko Toga and also bc most of my friends are mentally worried about me  (If you know you know)
I thought the same thing during the papa johns skit
We all have a bit of remy in our heart
Oh god yeah the tablespoon/teaspoon thing is a curse. I made that mistake with sesame oil once. *Never again*
Hey illy! We missed you !!
“Binging with lily”
yay matzo ball representation! also happy passover to all my fellow jews this saturday! :)
illy could literally talk about how to breath and id still love it
This video has caused me to call oven mitts B A K I N G  G L O V E S for the rest of my days.
Another tip:  The teaspoon abbreviation is ALYWAYS lowercase. and the Tablespoon is ALWAYS uppercase  ex. TBSP- Tablespoon tsp- Teaspoon
I love your videos, try not to lose one of your fingers when cooking...
Illy: But you can't cut your hand off and grow it in real life!   Lizards watching this : 👁👄👁
The random hand on the floor tho-
4:38 jujutsu kaisen????

I just realized the todoroki magnet-
I’m from Georgia so I know how amazing green bean casserole is but somehow I never thought about how weird that sounds
i'll never forget when i made chicken parmesan on my first attempt i served my old roommate some he still to this day kept asking me when i am coming to his place to make it now my best friend from 5th grade and my streaming friend want to try my cooking i'm shocked how my food can be this mouth watering
Kinda tastes like taxes ngl
My birthday is tommorow and no one is coming over and my parents will be working best 13th birthday ever...
Fun fact: I’m Mexican and we have our own version of matzo ball soup—it’s called albondigas, i recommended trying it
My dad cooked taco meat with the light off cuz we were watching some Marvel movies. So, when he put the "taco seasoning" in, we later found out he put a crap ton of cayenne pepper in and I was drying on the toilet seat.  Good times
I’m scared of knife,s
#7 on trending. Let’s go!!!
This is basically a anime story where the Main Character goal is to be good at cooking either way I still way it
Illy: if you enjoy all your fingers you where born with you ought to learn how to use sharp objects Me: oh so that's how I keep MY THREE FINGERS
"Become the seasoning" it is time for cannibal cooking

My first thought was DONT TELL ME you screwed up the green bean casserole!!!! 😭😫  I can confirm it’s delicacy.
Came here from insta, lots of love from Florida!!!  (✿ꈍᴗꈍ)
The pepper one reminds me when I was like 9/10 and my mum was cooking something thought one clove of garlic was the entire bulb so I went to school with garlic breath the next day. 😂🤣
😂😂😂 this is hilarious
Hmmm yes 😌🤚🏾. I need to buy me some baking gloves to wear
1:01 for a second i thought this song was a parody of meme time
As a semi professional cook I have to ask. HOW exactly can someone cut themselves with a potato pealer?
Congratulations on being number 7 on trending
7:49 wait is that jujustu kaisen 7:58 is that Todoroki
Taxes are my favorite flavor of cake frosting
I'm probably bad at cooking😥
Ah yes. Cooking. Pretty much just hardcore “making potions in your backyard when you were seven with actual edible ingredients”
When ur Jewish, and matzo ball soup is Jewish dish, and when it is a non jew’s favorite :D
Pepapig soup
good job on trending :D
Grapes on the fridge for mineta
I love cleaning casserole whoever says disgusting there's something wrong to taste buds
*Gumball sized? how large is your oc?* this isn't serious pls don't be rude in the comments :P
No one talking about todoroki on the Fridge 😃
2:11 Did Illy just break a fourth wall that technically never really existed
1:01 illy should make an album full of songs relating to food
I love all the anime references totoroki on the fridge
The definition at the start fits me! IM a failure!                                *cries in afraid to turn on the stove
No one: Illy: ‘hiss’
I don't cook that much, but I really like baking (:
yooooooo, Congrats of #7 trending
"peppa what are you doing in my soup?" Me: *flasbacks of draco (from the krew) says "peppa what are you doing in funnehs pool?"*
Love how I got a “skip the dishes” add ✋
I am visually impaired so there have been a fair amount of times where I have fucked up cooking.
Ok so this happened during Halloween time and my mom let me clean the seeds before they were baked and seasoned and while I was doing that I smelled something burning a bit but I didn’t pay any attention to it until the burning got visible to I told my mom about the burning and she freaked out and there were pizzas in the oven and my mom didn’t notice the pizza when she was pre heating the oven so she tried grabbing the boxes and put them outside and try to hose them down while I was in my bedroom with my kitten and after the pizza burned out my dog ate the burnt but soggy pizza
Ok except green bean casserole is banger??? And the best dish at thanksgiving???? Soy sauce is necessary for seasoning 😡
I would have eaten the green bean casserole with all that pepper
yeah, i think i'll just order pizza tonight.  hello? is this dominos? yes, yes extra *pepper*roni please.
1:56 one time I was cutting an unripe avocado (that makes it hard), it wouldn't go through so I added some force and ended up slicing (really deep) the flesh between your thumb and index finger
Wait, there were people that didn’t grow up with green bean casserole!??
Scrumptious
Mostaball soup...I’ll have to check it out!!! And now I have a suggestion for YOU! Try lentil soup. It’s delicious!!!
My mom and Sister cut themself almost all the time yet I cut down bottles with a Katana as one of my ways of relieving stress and I'm not trained in swordsmanship and I haven't cut myself
My friend's family PURPOSEFULLY like TRIPLED the amount of cinnamon in an apple pie. Not doubled, no. TRIPLED. By the way, I love your content and watch all your videos. I am a loyal subscriber and have all post notifications turned on. Keep up the good work!
a 10 minute and 50 second video about how you almost degloved your finger
I have no clue how to cook I only now how to cook soup.
Ah yes cooking  it's a beautiful thing  - - - if u know how to cook - - unlike me TvT
Tip from a professional chef: f#@k measuring seasoning. Season from your soul man! Add salt and pepper to taste! When it comes to other spices, yeah maybe do some measuring. But tbh when it comes to salt and pepper always start small and do it to taste. Your taste buds can differ from the person who wrote the recipe, so maybe you want more pepper, or less salt.season from the heart!
"Thankfully, I'm a cartoon character, so with the magic animation, I can grow my hand back. But you can't do that in real life, okay?" Love it. XD
I got a stitch on my chin, so for now it's only stuff like soup I'm able to eat and when she was singing about soup...I've never been more thankful for the food called soup.
Illymation loves jujutsu kaisen, btw i love sukuna 0w0
Olly can you do a video on what you think of animal crossing new horizons 😊
“I know how to hold a knife now”  *literally drops it*
Illy, the best advice I can give you is to get a Cast Iron Pan, and just put oil, vegetables and salt, _maybe_ some pepper on it, and throw it in an oven at 400 degrees, usually for 25 minutes, it just works and you don't even need to particularly worry about all the crazy convoluted "what the hell is seasoning? The Cajun?" stuff  Leave that for later, at least your veggies will be handled.  Oh, and have a good pair of oven mitts.  For the blade, a simple whetstone works. Back and forth over each side and up and down the blade and it'll cut like brand new, no more having to figure out of the red juice is coming from your tomatoes or you.
1:43 injury time.
I once cut myself 0-0 with a peeler... and my mom was beside me so I had to act like it didn't happen              Mother... if you reading this IM FINE. 🤣😅🤐

Green bean casserole is my comfort food, hell yessss Illy.
Stove turns on: AHH OOKA BOOGA FIRE BAD
Who else saw the Connie joke at the end😹

American food is uh... not cultured
I enjoy watching gordan ramsy cut up a hole fish, he just dose it so perfectly!😱
Maazo balls only thank you very much
The jjk crew in the portrait.
I absolutely love anything cooking and baking! I’ve watched multiple 45+ minute videos of professional Filleting fish cause it’s cool! I get almost hypnotized at thanksgiving watching everyone make all the food but back away when it gets to chaotic 😅. I love food and how it brings anyone and everyone together!
I own a microwave 😁👍 Also my friend is a cooking master so...
I cut my finger the same way now there is a scar lol
what does taxes taste like
I can’t taste peper
I’m a professional bean collector
ITS BEEN SO LONGGGGG 😻 and when we needed you the most... YOU CAME BACK THE BEST
The 1/4 tablespoon of Pepper fiasco happened to me too. I was making chicken and dumplings by Paula Dean 😅
Illy is teaching me cooking skills way better than my actual cooking teacher
dont think i didnt see that todoroki magnet on the fridge! if there is anything to do with mha, i will sense it with my entire being
If you want it, this is how I do my “fancy” ramen: In a large pot fill and begin boiling. In a small pot, add 2 cups water and begin the boiling process. In the small pot add a big spoonful of miso soup base, then add soba soup base until the color is as dark as you want (I usually do 1/4-1/3 of the bottle) then add fried tofu pieces. Open a can of chicken and rinse twice before adding to the broth pot. Separate the leaves from the stalks of baby bok choy 🥬 and add the leaves to the broth pot (you might wanna cut the leaves into smaller pieces but it’s not essential). If the large pot is boiling CarefullY put in an egg (and I also got this adorable egg timer to drop in to make sure it’s done), if the water is already boiling this guarantees that the yolk will be center. If the broth pot is boiling bring the stove down as low as you can while still being on. Cut the stalks of the baby bok choy 🥬 into strips, then use a peeler to ribbon a carrot. (Only do this next step with anti cut gloves cause otherwise I always cut my finger nails) Use the peeler to cut a radish or two into thin slices. When the egg is boiled (I recommend a medium-hard boiled if you can), use a spoon to remove from the boiling water, run under cold water to peel. Then cut the egg in half and add to the broth. Using the same pot as the egg, boil the ramen for exactly 3 minutes. When the ramen is cooked, strain and put into a very large bowl. Place the vegetables around the noodles (optional use scissors to top with green onions) then top with the broth and everything in it. Serve hot and sluuuurp.
WAIT 2:14, IS THAT A KARASUNO HIGH SCHOOL JACKET KSSKSJSK I NEED TO KNOW

Phew luckily my family good cook
That intro tho... too frikkin real. Even though I took culinary for two years in high school to learn how to cook, I forgot almost everything other than the chopping motion and the food safety unit which talked about foodborn illnesses. I wish I could forget some of that stuff :(
I nuke the animation moon “MWAHAHAHAHAHHA” Moon: *grows back* “Oh my hedgin god
I’m not from the south but darn I like my green bean casserole.
Of course you can’t live off Chipotle. Their food kinda sucks.
another wholesome content "de' illy"
Without my fingers I can't smoke pot
Illy you may be too late teaching me how to use a peeler- Because I did the exact same thing-
Gotta love the power of animation
Illymation is here to remind us that 'chaos' is not inherently a bad thing. It is simply something with an unpredictable outcome, and especially with cooking, can be a good thing.
Mazza Balls lol
5:48 Can i throw in a Tide-pod?
Now this, this is relatable
Cooking ...  Buy the cooking kit ... wow
Imagine having 3 pans smh
This made me feel better because we had to put my dog down. Thank for uploading you always make me laugh
Hmmm i did the same thing when peeeling potato.
As some one who likes cooking’s this was neat
Such a beautiful song Illy
I only ever got the A in my cooking class because I was the best in my class at chopping mincing and dicing
Hot dogs on a fiyer pit and had Berger’s  also beans  grild cheese
You are so beautiful Illy. ❤
I LOVE green bean casserole
oof...
3:36 *I LOVE GREEN BEAN CASSEROLE ITS MY FAV FOOD*
I tried to cook omelette rice once. It was terrible. also i completely forgot the most important condiment - salt - for both the rice and the egg so I had to eat it with occasional salt pinches
Your rant on matzo balls and soup is the most entertaining food description I’ve heard in ages XD
Ratatouille smell and put it in me can’t smell cause of covid
Head space with Illy
im 12 and im a good cook
I wonder what the potato was
6:20 the way she said that was funny
How do you know what taxes taste like😃

I'm sorry I put a piano
Or terrace robe I do like green beans p
I will be singing the knife song in Culinary class now lol. And I have to say that my favorite part about cooking (other than making the food) is always seeing other people enjoy it :) and I love your videos
omg thanks Illy!! I now know:   - how to handle a knife again - some stuff I can try to cook - to watch out for too much/less peppah - and where to buy a sweet apron -
Did anyone else notice that the airplane has an anus?
Once I made chocolate chip cookies but forgot the flour :)   It was terrible

Peppaaaaaa wut are you doing in my soupy
You are 100% correct about the green bean casserole thing.
hello from Portugal. where we pride ourselves on food, recipes learn, and past from grandmother to mother to daughter. I hope you one-day try Portuguese food, mostly our pastries (pastel de nata with cinnamon) I hope your stay safe, your animation and stories are awesome
YOU BLESSED ME ON MY PERIOD FANK YOUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
Illy :I’m a cartoon character and I can magically grow my hair back but you can’t do that in real life. Lizards: ...
Imagine Gordon Ramsay is watching this......
Hisss
Grace Field Meat?!! 😭
Afraid of the stove...? I STILL GET SCARED BY THE TOASTER!!!! I'M 21!!!
My mom went to college for COOKING and she knows how to burn water WATER!
Dude I’ve been watching Illy more often than normal recently and it’s cool that she uploaded whilst I was still in “let’s watch Illy” hole
I LOVE GREENBEAN CASSEROLE.
You add the SALSAA!... You add the MASAA!.... You add the SAUCESAAa!.... You add The PASTA!.... *YOU* *PUT* *THA* !...Wait.
One time my brother accidentally did the same teaspoon/tablespoon thing but with oil in cookies. Needles to say, they were bad
I GOT A PAPA JOHNS ADD LIKE RIGHT AFTER THE JOKE I LOVE THAT😂❤️
Hey illy great vid, hope the video makes u a good chef👍♥️
I'm a little mad at theodd1sout for not uploading
BAKING GLOVES. 🤣
Why does it sound like my culinary class
Someone gotta teach her how to season, not only did she try to use only pepper. She measures. We gotta teach her some more flavour, expand the horizons 💀
What a coincidence, I JUST totally bombed making a bowl of Kraft mac n cheese. I didn’t even know you could screw up a bowl of Kraft mac n cheese but I did!
"Peppa, What are you doing in my soup"  IM DIEING XD
I just wanna say thank you for not showing us your cut, yes I act like a 5 year old. But that is okay my friends.
When was this?
Illy: cuts her finger with peeler while trying to cut a potato Me: tries the cut avocado and *accidentally slits my wrist*
nice meals illy i love how u do all these animations it is so awesome
Love the green bean casserole that’s the same way we cook it
8:10 ANYONE CAN COOK ANYONE CAN COOK EVERYWHERE YOU LOOK ANYONE CAN COOK SOMETHING SOMETHING SOMETHING
1:01 soup time
“Green been casserole, grandmas recipe”
i love cooking
**gasp** Peppa? What are you doing in the video???????
The video feels ironic, I just finished my cooking class today
Hi, illy!
Buy and use a Slow Cooker.  The great thing about them is.  You don't have to do much.  Most recipes are DUMP/SET and LEAVE IT ALONE (with a little bit of cutting).  Heck once you set it to cook.  GO LIVE YOUR LIFE!!!  WHY??  Because most recipes take 6-8hrs to cook.  Start it before leaving for work and come home to a hot meal that is ready for you to serve (great for single people or very busy parents).
The cookbook with the green bean casserole recipe with Yuji Itadori in it.
love the anime refrences
to anyone know nothing about you when they see one video they figure out you aren't family friendly your channel is misleading
ILLY
3:46 ok so, green bean casserole story time: my mom makes the BEST green bean casserole you will ever have, and I remember every thanksgiving, my mom would make me cute the tops of of like hundreds of green beans
Surprised you didn't make any Mac sticks
Apparently youtube's on it's BS again, so i didn't get the notification when you uploaded
illymation: if u like haveing all ur fingers then becareful  me: LETS PLAY THE KNIFE GAME GET THE SONG ROLLING BOIS
“ You put the balls in the water and they float” that’s what she said :)
5:12 SHOOOOOOOOTOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Uchiha tears lool!
She’s cooking up chaos
The matzo ball soup is actually good!
I have sliced part of my fingers so many times, I even somehow managed to cut my fingers while washing carrots!
Duolingo says if you don’t take your Spanish lessons today it’s   i n j u r y     t i m e
I tried making banana bread once but accidentally put salt instead of sugar. it was a mess 😂
Th’y animation and detail brings much joy
She referenced the Ratatouille Musical I'm gonna cry-
NEW NEW
mmmmmmmm i love my uchiha tears soup
I added salt to my tea once and I wanted to throw up
Can't wait for illy's "Stew Time" dropping in the next [redacted] or so.
is nobody going to notice that Todoroki is on the fridge?

I know how too cook top ramen to hold knife correctly and I'm 9 ratatouille refense

MATZO BALL SOUP IS THE BEST SOUP EVER TO ROAM EARTH TELL ME I`M WRONG <3
I had to stop the video. Maaz... how DARE you disrespect the Green Bean Casserole?! That stuff is the food of the GODS! 0 _0
me a 12 old who loves to bake and cook: ... ILLY LET ME HELP YOU
Soup time soup time
as someone who has put a tablespoon of baking powder in cookies my biggest advice when you make one measurement too big is make all the measurements big...fucking feed an army
finally you fin a vid
I like how u included itadori kun in the cooking book:D
The "PePpA, wHAt ArE yOu doInG In mY SOUp?"   Words cant Express how great that was..
Did u spot the shoto todaroki in the back of he r kitchen i didn’t no u ur a Mha  FAN
Aye done that pepper mistake too. When I make a big pot of stew, I use a whole teaspoon, but when its just a single meal, just quarter... lets say I forgot the portion. Big oof...
One time I cut my self with a slicer and for a month I didn't have a finger topt
I hope you washed your hands
Illy’s art style just keeps getting better and I’m here for it
I'm not an adult just a teenager, I can relate because I live alone.. if you live alone you will have to cook your own food- every time I want to cook something.. it will take me 2 hours to make it perfect..  Edit: This video is so relatable
I clicked this at 199k now it says 200k
"Thankfully I'm a cartoon character," reminds me of that one Sonic says.
i cant count how many times i put in too much salt in a dish
Yo I knew u was gonna say a casserole
Mashed potatoes iz good
the 82 people who disliked are dummys
I love cooking and I'm 9  And my brother is 13 and he doesn't know how too  And yes my family watch me

THE AMOUNT OF JUJUTSU KAISEN REFERENCES ILLY PLSS
If one of yours parents loves to cook or is one get as many cooking lessons as you can get from them before you move out or while they are still around (if they are caring good parents) or try your grandparents if they know how to cook is also a good tip
I hate you
Oven mitts are lame I like baking gloves better
God I haven't had green bean casserole in years and boy howdy do I want some
I literally feel like this was made for me because I just sliced my thumb a couple days ago slicing potatoes 🤦  Love you so much Illy!!!
Lol as soon as you said green bean casserole, an ad for Uber eats popped up 😅
for me the opposite i am good at cooking but to scared to draw

I want matzoh ball soup now 😔
you should have called them illymittens
06:19 — Is “Peppa, what are you doing in my soup?” a reference to something? … To the overseasoned green bean casserole? 😅  I genuinely don’t know …
Matzo ball soup is the best! Hands down!
Can't believe I'm here this early I'm usually late 😂
*EW, GREEN BEANS AND CASSEROLE. YUCKY WUCKY NO THANK YOU*
I totally related with this video and it gave me a little hope for myself in the kitchen <3 Thanks! Also, I LOVE the apron and I just got one for my boyfriend!
Hahaha I loveeeeeeee thiss
I’ve had matza ball soup and it’s amazing
This video reminded me of my high school culinary classes and my classmates who had no idea how to cook. I had one classmate put cream cheese in the microwave with the wrapper on. I had another who broke a knife and glass which both ended up in the soup and then she served it like there was nothing wrong with it. I had another that ate a cheese cloth spice bag from a soup. I ended up being in charge of my most of my kitchens in class because I had more experience with cooking and baking. Also we watched ridiculous safety videos which were helpful but still hilarious. Amazing video. I hope you have a wonderful weekend.
Who else noticed some anime reffrences in illy's kitchen, Just me? :)
No one: Not a single soul on god's green earth: My brain:  Remy, the ratatouille The rat of all my dreams I praise you, my ratatouille May the world remember Your name
Jujutsu Kaisan in the back
Our family has a tradition of making matzo ball soup too! I make it every few weeks and it is my favorite food ever, I enjoy it so much that it makes my whole day better every time I make it. You described it perfectly! And you're totally right, making it is the best part.
"salt n pepa, what are you doing in my soup?"
I put thyme chipotle (it’s a spicy pepper) a 1/8 teaspoon of cumin cause it has a overwhelming taste and garlic
I started cooking when i was twelve years old and i'd say my cooking is pretty good. I wish I could teach people how to make excellent food or at least to have people try my cooking.
15 and super scard of our new gas burners. I only had electric up until now. I didn't know the lite thing and it scared the crap out of me I almost peed myself.
Not a great cook, either, spilt the cream all over the ground and sneezed on the shallots because they were giving me allergies.
A yes the southern green bean casserole... I have never related to an episode more. Ahhhh... memories😌
Lmao Peppa
The peppa joke killed me 😂😂
I felt so called out on the chipotle thing
Man i was having a bad day and Illy really posted and made me smile, i hope you had a good break, we all missed you! ❤️
My mother made a killer broccoli casserole for every family get-together.
Hehehe I was making spaghetti while watching this video and I burned my hand
Long time no see
Jujutsu Kaisen! Hell yeah brother!!!
My biggest kitchen mess up was when I made sugar cookies. I had my dry ingredients in clear bins unlabeled. I was supposed to put in 5 cups of flour but accidentally added powdered sugar. I didn't realize until I was 3 cups in. Cookies were still good just super super sweet and extra crunchy. Also I freaking love your sponsorship. I saw it and immediately went I must acquire new apron.
The only thing I know how to make from scratch are meatballs.
NO PUNS IN THE KITCHEN
😂😂
Wait this is so perfect my mom has been wanting an apron!
*having a serious moment* *like Remy Ratatouille the rat of all my dreams*
My family's casserole  of choice is definitely broccoli, cheese, rice casserole. owo It's just too good to pass up. While I'm not a fan of green bean casserole, I get the dedication to a dish~
Literally love how meme-ish you are. Absolutely love it 😍
Once I was making a birthday cake for myself and the recipe said 1 1/4 tsp of salt but I read it as 11/4 and since I didn’t know what 11/4 was I for some reason I added 11 teaspoons of salt 😩✋
Peppa 😂😂😂😂😭😭😭
Any one else notice the todoroki on the fridge? It was so cutee😍🤩
Glad to know I'm not the only one that gets random desires to bake cookies at 2 in the morning.
Amazing animation Illy its awesome keep up the good work
0:08 and this is why i subscribe
With such of a huge ass flame I would be scared of the stove too x'DDD
One time I sliced my fingernail in half when I  was six and trying to make "mashed potatoes"
Illy: peppa what are you doing in my soup  peppa: I was trying to find mama pig  Illy: 👁️👄👁️
I was a salty child knowing I didn’t get to see green bean casserole unless it was the holidays. My dad has the best green bean casserole even though you make it the exact same every where you go.
Omg Ily your so goofy in this videos
I’m glad you’re back! Hope you had a great break! 😊 P.S. I’m also not a very good cook lol.
OMG YOUR NOT DIED !!!!
Illy : teaches how to make matzo ball soup  Me with a jewish family : do not cite  the deep magic to me witch, for I was there when if was written
Finally some story time animators are posting
When you eat an edible 6:37
"Yeah, okay. A fourth tablespoon of pepper. If you say so." *Turns out to be teaspoon* "OF COURSE!" I felt that.
ok then
Ah injuries in the kitchen, last summer I grating cheese, with you know, as cheese grater, and at one point I brushed my finger knuckle against the grater, I didn’t feel anything so I didn’t think about until I was done shredding and looked down at my knuckle and went ‘Oh hey, my finger’s bleeding’ So yeah, I shredded my knuckle against the grater and it took a chunk of skin out of my finger, that was fun, there’s also the time I accidentally cut my thumb while using an apple slicer, still have a v shaped scar from that.
“Wam-bam Christmas ham” -illy
Omg 6 hours yessss
When you drop the knife down to the floor tip down you give me anxiety
3:40  you just need to be a southerner to know how good it is 😌 💅
Maz green bean casserole is the BOMB!!!! Yes, yes native southerner here
I burned cup mac and cheese... I don't think I'll be making much food anytime soon.
Knifes also get chipped in a dishwasher because they shake and hit the other dishes and such . Take it from me I had that drilled into my head at college. That's what I get for having an associates in culinary arts.
Soup time is now my favorite song
I’m I the only one who noticed that she keeps putting anime Easter eggs in her vids?
Softball size matzo balls are where its at for me
I made the soup and it does taste really good.
Okay- With her all about talking about fingers- all i can think of is the ex-Brazilian president that had only 9 fingers xD We used to tell jokes about what would happen if instead of losing our pinky we lost our thumb and we suddenly became the king of the universe or something xD Just because the president became the president after a factory accident (or something) so ye- I do wanna chomp my finger off >:[
Hi sorry I'm late
The fact that she had a portrait of Yuji, Nobara, and Megumi on her wall makes me happy!! Thanks for that wonderful anime reference Illy!! 😊😊😊❤️❤️❤️
4:52 TODOROKI IS ON THE FRIDGE EEE
I sent this to my Young Living teacher and she loved it so much 💗
Green bean casserole needs milk too, but you're not lying when you say it's the bomb dot com.
I'm 13 so I can't cook
The most I can cook is pancakes and tortilla pizza
Hey, guess what? I’ve never even touched a single pot. Oh wow.
so we just not going to the fact their was many anime hints like the haikyu one i was freaking out
I love cooking because my mom suggested I learn how to cook.  I suggest scrambled eggs once you get that down it’s easy to use the stovetop
Your 1/4 tablespoon of pepper is about 7/8 teaspoon, so like 3 times the amount of pepper
K but when "soup time" mv???
Yesterday I made banana bread (but its more cake than bread) and apparently the baking soda hates me, so every time I take a slice its a lottery. Will I get cake? Or will I get something so bad I wanna puke? NOBODY KNOWS
If anyone wants some easy ways to cook stuff, you should get a pressure cooker/instant pot, you can make so much easy and complex stuff in it You can make yogurt, cheesecake, cook corn, cook soup, beef stroganoff, soups, and so much more I'll post some recipes here in a reply later to help those looking for something easy or new to make P.S.: It's not just instant pot recipes either, you can make your own bread and cookies without too much effort Also I really like the thumbnail, super eye catching and asthectically pleasing!  Don't worry about taking a break btw, we all need breaks, so take them when you feel you need it Hope you all have a wonderful rest of your day!
Jokes on you i can't eat peppa pig
This inspired me to cook...   So I made ramen ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Oh my god you post again yay hiiii I mist you
Honestly. I can relate to the pepper thing. One time I was in charge of making soup at our house. And that’s when I just broke my glasses. And I thought it said a 5 tablespoons of pepper. It said 3 teaspoons of pepper-
Me trying to cook:
ah yes me as a 12 year old is really good at making spaghetti and TACos
7:17 ok they are just adorable in this scene
6:02 lol I'm eating papa johns while watching this.
Ratatouille 2: Illy tried.
As a Texan, I can confirm green bean casserole is amazing. Easily the dish I most look forward to on Thanksgiving.
I need that soup song on Spotify
Welp I’ll teach my kids how to cook like my mum did
The mortar and pestle is for cooking definitely not black salt and magick
Once I put a 2 tablespoons of salt in cookies when it was supposed to be 2 TEAspoons. Ah I suck at making cookies
REMY MY BABY
Bean Casserole sounds great, but if you like baked beans then almost nothing beats Bean Pie. My grandmother used to make it for my father since he was the only vegetarian in the family, and the dish has stuck with him ever since. It's basically just baked beans in olive oil under a layer of steamed then mashed potato topped with cheese. It's baked for about 10 minutes then grilled until the cheese darkens. It's a comfort food that I'll eventually be passing down to my grandchildren too.
Why is no one talking about peppa....
Tryed though
6:42 I've never felt so relaxed in my entire life before. Cooking is heaven.
think of the children ..... ooh simpsons referance
I can’t believe I’m saying this on YouTube  but my brother drinks hot sauce straight of the bottle and I eat some spicy seeds that are a mix of Japan, Chinese and Indian seasoning... straight of the pot
when i am 18 and i rent a house with a roommate, i will make that kind of soup for them and me
matza ball soup vid right before passover, the timing of your bid is immaculate
WHY DOES THIS COMMENT SECTION JUST SAYS, THAT MATZO BALLS ARE AMAZING, BUT I LIVE IN GERMANY, SO I NEVER HEARD OF THEM. AAAAAH
I just watched every illymation video. All the way from the unamerican airlines one. Binge master probably.
shef
when the world needed her most, she returned
Of course she posts this the day I do cooking class and make cheesy garlic bread 😂
Loving the backgrounds!
illy, you are the Hideo Kojima of the storytime animators! ❤
pft ahh yes lemme just get some Uchiha Tears to go with my Angst Salad
YEEE YAY ILLH POSTED
Matzo ball soup is amazing
imma be honest im subbed to so many people so i usually forget about  illymation  but every time i come back i binge watch all the videos because they are that good
I like to bake, I’m just not very good at it
LMAOO  "Peppa what are you doing in my soup~" XD
Recipes you can’t mess up:  Pasta: 1. Boil water 2. Add the pasta 3. Strain out the water when pasta is cooked  Basic chicken or vegetable broth soup: 1. Boil the amount of water you want for your broth 2. Add chicken or vegetable base 3. Add whatever you want to add  Food with instructions on the box 1. Follow the instructions on the box    (This isn’t meant to be rude it’s just a joke and for those who genuinely don’t know how to cook pasta or soup then uh here you go)
It my birthday today
Keep on cooking boo. Hopefully one day I'll get to try your Matzo ball soup
If it make u feel any better, I made that tsp/tbsp  mistake... but with chilli. Yes, chilli.
ARGGG I ONLY GET TO HAVE MAZTO BALL SOUP ON PASSOVER BUT I WOULD KILL FOR IT
You are probably the fastest animator and one of the best
My first finger cut was on my thumb with a zester back in culinary school. Excellent vid. It even taught me something new. And I’ve been cooking in commercial kitchens for 5+ years. Also I will be calling them baking gloves from now on. XD
Matzo ball soup vid just in time for Passover! Perfect!
i LOVE the apron and when i have more money i'm definitely getting one
Illy sound just like my home ec teacher right now 😂
I’ve done the same thing with misreading amounts. I was making garlic bread and it asked for 1/4th teaspoon garlic powder. I *might* have put 1/4th cup in instead.
WOW this video was well timed!  Yesterday I finally attempted something I had been wanting to make for years, Home-make potstickers. I planned a dinner for my family w/ miso soup, fresh rice, and MANY potstickers. I found a recipe and it was going so well. I spent 2 hours making the dumpling dough, kneading it, rolling it, and using a cookie cutter to cut them out. I carefully stacked them on a plate with flour, and began filling them with the pork-cabbage-green onion mixture. All of the meticulously pre-cut wrappers had melted together into one, big, doughy ball on the plate. I panicked It was already around 6 Pm, I didn;t have time to let the dough rest and roll it out again, and the ball was already rolling on the rice and soup I enlisted the help of my mom and sisters, and cut up the dough ball. We had to stretch each piece of dough by hand, and they were so lumpy and odd. My mom and I devised a new plan for cooking them and we all got to work putting together an assembly line of weird doughy balls and hot oil.   Nothing about these potstickers was going according to my plan, everything was failing, I was literally just wandering around the kitchen in shock for several minutes, I was so upset and frustrated that I had an ADHD meltdown/episode, I coult barely keep from crying and just sitting on the floor and dissociating at the wall. I thought I was at least an intermediate home chef, i thought I would be able to do this, what was wrong with me?  It ended up okay, the cooking method worked and they tasted great, everyone liked them. But I was so exhausted by the end of it (P.S,  Dumpling dough is just as soft and stretchy as it looks)
When you are the child of a Italian mom they will teach you how to cook. Italians know how to cook it comes natural to them.
My b-Day is in 4 days 😁
I don't know how, but one time while I was making pancakes and added 1 tablespoon instead of a teaspoon. I had to eat it all because my mom said I needed to because I made 10 pancakes for myself only. It was awful.
As a tiny jewish child I also grew up eating matzo ball soup and I can say, it is such a homie dish that's great on a blizzardy night
Grandmas:its my secret recipe Me: its a pancake box isnt it?
I love your videos Illy, greetings  PD: espero haberlo escrito bien xd
bro green bean casserole is yum
Omg just realized that every single one of your videos ends with a little moral and thats so adorableeee. P. D. I also now wanna try matzo ball soup.
These vids are blursed
I really love this Chanel, it’s so great! The stories are funny and entertaining and the animation is so wonderful pretty!!!🤩🤩
I’m great at cooking but I’m quite young
Wait, I love green bean casserole...
when my fam makes matza ball soup, we use mushroom soup, and its fricken DELICIOUS
girl its been so long
Thank you for opening my eyes to this my step mom‘s birthday is in a few weeks and you just like totally save me
this soup bout to pop off
0:40 the mere fact that she has enough money to order chipotle everyday while I have to contemplate for a small fry makes me feel like a peasant
Grace field meat 😂😂 im dead
Lol, I've been cooking since I was like 8, with supervision. Then as soon as I was a preteen and allowed to stay home alone I was allowed to cook alone, as long as I knew where the baking soda was in case of grease fires and where the fire extinguisher was just in case it got out of control.  I can cook a lot of stuff and improvise foods... I'm just lazy and I hate doing dishes.
The backrounds are so amazing  :00000 ❤❤❤❤❤❤
She sure talks a lot about fingers
Bruh I love illymation
for some reason the build up at the beginning of the video 0:00 to be clear, I thought she was building up to a skillshare ad
I always get so happy when you post
That is so funny that you posted it today!!! I just made matzoh ball soup 🍲, i’m Jewish and passover is Saturday night so we had to make the soup in advance because it’s tradition!!! This made me so happy 😁
Ok so one of my favorite foods to make is something I like to call pesto toast! Here’s the origin story of pesto toast, I woke up one morning and I was craving pesto chicken, but my zoom class was starting soon and I didn’t have enough time to make the pasta (also I know pesto chicken is meant to be like a dinner or lunch, but it was quarantine and I wanted pesto so don’t come at me). So I took some sour dough bread, spread the pesto on it, put some slices chicken that my mom cooked the night prior, put more pesto on, added a pinch of salt and put it in the oven for like five minutes. It’s REALLY REALLY good, and I highly recommend putting some mozzarella cheese on if you have some!
I can’t wait until the makers of matza ball soup suddenly see a giant up tick in purchases
I swear I saw a bunch of Easter eggs for my hero academia
I Love soup so much !!!
Illy, with all due respect, what kind of polishing do your tacos need?? You brown the ground beef, add spices, then put it in a shell. Which part of that have you yet to perfect?
I remember once when my BFF was making chicken fajitas for us she sent me to the store to pick up the shredded cheese cause we didn't have any. I've never made fajita's before so when I got to the shredded cheeses I texted her asking what kind I should pick up. No answer. Five minutes later, still no answer. So not wanting to spend forever in the store I just grabbed one. Turns out my friend had decided to go take a shower and leave me hanging. The fajitas were okay but the mix of cheese I grabbed wasn't very mixed. It was about 60% cheddar and while I like cheddar I'm not keen on just eating a big giant glob of it with a little bit of chicken mixed in.
Im 9 and I can cook
Glad to hear your much-needed break went well! Thank you so much for creating such a great animation, it was fire 😀🔥. We will make sure to hold the knife like a cat from now on 😂. This comment will most likely be buried but the team here wanted to thank you and your fans for the support! Means a great deal to a small business like ours! Much love to you and your fans! ❤️ Lillie & Mert
I love green bean Castrol and my foster mom teaches me how to make it
I just started a cooking class for my choice of 5th period and illy makes a cooking video what are the odds
The tablespoon changing to a teaspoon when you turn your back really captures what it’s like to cook/bake with dyslexia.
Potatoes are the best veggie for the sole purpose that you can basically do anything with them
sorry, but it is physically not possible to put too much pepper into something
im very picky about food for no reason.i dont get it.its my opinion but i still dont get.pls reply if u relate to me
Do you eat food
Hi Ella sorry if I spelt your name wrong ❤️🧡💛💚💙💜
Matzo ball soup is great
I quite enjoy green bean casserole. Try it with some cream of chicken soup.
i once severely burnt bagel bites in the microwave because it said “3 minutes for 10 bagels” and my mind thought “haha 3 minutes for 5 bagels is probably the same thing”.    it was not
Recommendation for chicken. In the morning or around lunch time if you let it thaw in the morning, take a dressing or marinade that you like, caesar dressing or teriyaki marinade. Then you grab olive oil and seasons you like. I recommend salt, pepper, adobo, greek seasoning and whatever else you want. Put it all in a ziploc with the chicken. Marinade until you are ready to cook. Now you can cook it in the air fryer or oven at around 375~ temperature until it’s done.
Cook
yes a new video
This is the best type of sponsorship!!! Yes!!!!!
Damn right when I started to get in cooking
THE GRACE FIELD MEAT EASTER EGG I'M-
I don't know if it's intentional but posting a Matzo ball soup recipe 3 days before the Passover Seder is the perfect timing, because It's a jewish traditional meal!!!
Let me guess? Hello Fresh
You cant live off of chipotle...well i guess you can but...do you really want to live your life that way?                  Me: YES
I was grappling my computer charger to play Minecraft ad a add played and I was like “What the freak is that song-“
I wanna see the update on animal crossing new horizons did you get biscuit again😂😂plz make an update video would love that a lot
I freaking love this video, especially the beginning 😂 I thought she was gonna start off with a sponsor, and then she just started😂👌🏼
YESSSSS
"Grace Field Meat" "Uchiha Tears" "Gojo Juice"....girl I can't XD thank you for making me laugh so hard hahaha
I have this really thin glove for cutting stuff it’s like an oven not but thin. So when I peel or cut stuff I don’t get hurt. You should invest in one 😌
At the start I was bracing myself for a Blue Apron sponsor
I may be 19 but I am forever a kid.   I have the right as an American to identify my self as a 4 year old, HA
4:55 I SEE THAT MHA TODOROKI STICKER ON YOU FRIDGE 👀
Raw meat makes me nauseous. So I went vegetarian for a few months and that taught me how to cook. I learned how to make Mushroom wild rice soup. It's the best thing that I can make ❤️. My friend who does eat meat loves it so much.
Dude that green bean casserole is the my family uses at every holiday
Mob syco fridge sticker
One time I put 3 tbs of salt instead of sugar and 1 tsp. I dont know how I got them mixed up but they were not good pancakes.

YAYYYYY THE QUEEN OF ANIMATION IS BACKKKKKK 🥳🥳🥳🥳

When I was young, i cooked breakfast for myself sometimes.
I have recently been offered an opportunity to supervise and teach some cookery lessons at my old primary bc I was apparently the good cook of my year idk that is what the teacher said....I'm 13 I have to teach 7-8 year olds not to chop their hands off haha I still attend cookery lessons tho
What do your cats think of you being Remi?
aAHHHH
My mom always said making the matzo balls was hard so I never tried, but guess who’s suddenly gonna make it themself to introduce their partner to the ways of matzoh for Passover? This bean! Thanks for the assurance that the soup is not demon incarnate to make, I shall CONQUER THE SOOOP
IDK if you know this but Passover’s tomorrow, you usually make matzaball soup.
I added half a tablespoon of baking soda instead of half a teaspoon to my carrot cake once.  Double check your spoon measurements, kids.
GIRL!!! I FRICKING LOVED MATZO BALL SOUP IT IS DELICIOUS. I SWEAR TO GOD, IT WAS THE BEST DISH DURING PASSOVER. IM JEWISH SO I HAVE IT ALMOST EVERY WEEK. YALL GOTTA TRY IT
last time I baked I forgot baking soda and my cookies started b o i l i n g :’D
Anybody has Jewish has tried Matzah ball soup at least once- My grandma makes the best 🤤
How do you know what taxes taste like My Brain: she ate her taxes so she doesn’t have to pay it
Hay um ilasay
becoming good at cooking does take time, like anything else, i started when i was 10, im 15 now and i think im pretty good
Sorry I havent been keeping Up Illy, my new year is not off to a good start and ive been busy

you're so good at drawing backgrounds
Heads up to all of you making bakery or anything that has dry and wet ingredients.  I never thought mixing the dry and wet ingredients were that important until I made pancakes.  I was making home made pancakes from my mom’s recipe, just added all the ingredients together, and then the salt.  Let’s just say there were little salt surprise bites in the pancakes
OK now I wanna make the soup
“if you know what’s good for you don’t come in here”
I love ur apron ❤️
Soup time Soup time!
I have been cooking since I was younger. I’ve had my fair share of pepper misshaps. My favorite recipe is noodles, sauce, tons of pepper, banana peppers, carrot shavings, mushrooms, more spices. It’s amazing and super spicy and I love it
I love the way you animate food! Your art is incredible 💖
Illy, I’m not even a teenager and I can cook.         Where is ur life skills?
Hey, When I was in college, I would make tuna noodle casserole 2 to 3 times a week. You had way more variety than I did.
*OMG YES GREEN BEAN CASSEROLE SLAPS*
Hi Bryson aka ham man

I literally died when she made the Peppa joke
Living in Michigan we love greenbeen casserole
Her powerpuff girls reference in the kitchen 🥺😭❤️
It’s great that animators like illy are making videos again, but what about TheOdd1sOut? He has not made a video ever since his last video about his “GIF.” I hope he makes one soon.
I am jewish and im quite touched you like matzah ball soup. i also think it is delicious.
ratatouille 👌🏻
I’m a kid and I can relate this, so stick with the PB and J
Not Peppa in your soup ✋😩
Or just be raised with common sense....
The anime references are pure gold
I love your content
I thought the intro was a sponsor
The apron is fireeee
Illy is such a great animator and makes great jokes and I'm always glad when she posts a video
as a jew, I am HONORED that she made a matzo ball soup-                        its so damn good
is it just me or is illy uplodeing more faster and faster and better and better videos that get more halarios you go illy hip hip harray x3
One time I added too much salt to my pizza sauce because of the whole teaspoon/tablespoon mix up... felt like I was gonna throw up and die from tasting it on a spoon
Nol
I love green bean casserole it's my favorite
So I might’ve gone back just to hear the soup song 💀
i like baking and cooking but sometimes i don’t feel like trying cuz i’m sad or tired but also hungry so i have this little chocolate mug cake recipe so i thought i’d share it with all of y’all   it does cook more evenly in a bowl so try that too  1/4 cup flour 1/4 cup sugar 2 tbsp cocoa powder 1/8 tsp baking soda A pinch of salt 1/4 cup of milk 2 tbsp oil A little bit of vanilla extract Mix thoroughly & i mean it!! i c u mix like u mean it Microwave for two minutes and enjoy i hope all of you have a good day :)))
Did anyone else notice that in the end card she had a jar that said Connie??🥩
I am SO craving matzoh ball soup now. I miss living in NYC! Matzoh ball soup on every corner!
1:41 damn  😔
peppa what are you doing in my soup
I believe that the soup time song is what my grandma sings when she makes soup
My mom adds too much seasonings sometimes.
“ you’re a good dishwasher too”  should I be worried
(0:20) so apparently I’m an adult at 14 years old. Lol.
Man, I had a mid-life crisis a little while ago before I hit the middle ages of my life over the fact that I’m living off instant food and fast food. This video really put that into perspective for a second
The magnets on the fridge 👏 beauty 😌
My favorite thing about the video is the thumbnail
Hello mother
Peppaaaaaaaaa  What’re u doing in this video
The comments are just filled with other Jewish people talking about matzo ball soup. And I am here for it!
Love it when she posts!
yucky wucky no thank you
This is one of the few sponserships that I would enjoy
Who else got the simply pun
So when are you making Illybaking?
first time i cookes spaghetti was with a friend who was used to cooking for 5 people, i was cooking for two, she put the salt in as she was used to, we barely ate the pasta
That thumbnail be the "this is fine".
Another knife safety tip is if you do wind up dropping your knife DO NOT try and grab it before it hits the floor. Everyone has that spilt second reaction to try and grab things before they hit the floor and it might take a while to train your brain, but please don't try and catch it. Just back up so it can't hit your leg or foot and then when it hits the floor you can pick it up, rinse it off and continue working.
*B A K I N G G L O V E S*
Here's a recipe for good scrambled eggs. Two eggs Dash of salt Crackering of black pepper Smacking of dried garlic Italian seasoning (add as much as you want, my lil sis once added wayy too much and it was delicious)  Combine & mix all in bowl, and pour in BUTTERED pan. Now, the secret for adjustable scrambling size is how long you keep it on the pan before you scramble it. Longer means bigger! Once it is no longer gooey, you can serve it.   Bone apple tea.
sharp objects in the words of my old woodshop teacher, you know your teacher is good if they're not missing any fingers
YASSSS MATZAH BALL SOUP!!!!
Please post more I love ur vids and u haven’t posted in forever
Me being a southerner hearing green bean casserole: YASS QUEEN
*laughs in child
I had the same thing happen to me but I cut my fingernail off ;-;
This is a fantastic video I subscribe to the channel
todoroki i see you man
Illy we all know now just make a anime vid we see all the refrences
Yay a new video. ALSO when is Soup time going on Spotify????
MATZO BALL SOUP LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOO
Are we not going to mention how the rat in the thumbnail is gagging. And rats can't gag. So this food is no bad it broke the laws of nature.
We had a potluck and I made a green bean casserole and...    ad: WATER TASTE LIKE WATER
I'm not happy with the amount of fingers I'm born with. I want more so I won't be listening to you
Who else saw "Grace Field Meat" 5:50 sec into the video... cuz i did 😀
At first i was confused my peppa was in the soup but after seeing it a couple of time i soon figured out why
0^0
I can only cook scrambled eggs and cutting edible plants
Another part of dull knoves is that they hurt more than sharp knives. If you gently, GENTLY, feel the blade of the knife you would feel the dull parts but not the sharp. Also when you are using sharp objects try to cut away from you
Wow your better then me!
Why is it always the pepper!? And why did it have to be spicy peppers!? It burned so good.... until it was time to day goodbye.
I love green bean cassarole.
When I was in elementary school, in chorus we had a song that we preformed at our concert that was all about green bean casseroles called “Greenbean Casserole”
For all off the mexican people she is makin albóndigas 😏😏😏
Why am I taking notes on illys cooking video. I'm literally a chef.
5:51 .....uchiha tears?
hi im here kinda early, fun
i know how to hold a knife *immediately drops knife*
I actually made Macarons about a month ago. Even though it certainly wasn't perfect I was very proud that they actually tasted good and looked okay. I enjoy cooking and stuff but macarons are the ultimate test for a baker, every proportion has to be exactly perfect. If they say 2 large eggs you cannot have 2 extra large eggs, they have to be large.
Damn I've never seen no one get crazy into making soup...Illy is my spirit animal 😌
Bruh I have cut my finger before like that
i cut the whole top of my finger off with a potato peeler one time :(
4:38 AHH MEGUMI, ITADORI , AND NOBARA 🥺🥺
4:36. “I failed to properly prepare the pepper proportions!” XD
Shalom!
I miss your videos
MY FAVORITE TOO
Green bean casserole is the BEST
In my school right now I am doing my cooking classes
Wait you eat taxes
Wow!! Those aprons are cool!
The first time my dad made banana bread and he burnt the crust if you took of the crust it was actually good and yeah I cut myself multiple times with a peeler
"Become the seasoning" we could make a religion out of that!
3:40 I had a happiness-stroke when I saw the todoroki magnet omigosh im dying YES
wow :O
3:03 is your foot ok? looks like you dropped a knife on it.
Omg happy Passover Illy!!!
Illy: "im not a good cook"  Me, an intellectual: *I cooked the water perfectly :D*
I'm known for eating way too much pepper on food so I kind of wanna try green bean casserole with that much pepper now hmmm
did someone say.....knife!?
IDK who doesn't like Green Bean Casserole... but that stuff's fire. I'd eat that all day, every day.
THE ANIME REFERENCES IN THE BACKGROUND OMG
i only know how to make mac and cheese as well as scrambled eggs
She's BACK😆
I want another recipe pls 😂
I get a notification from illymation *LE GASP*
2:08 - What, are you Astar the War Amps robot? _I can put my arm back on, you can't, play safe._
Illy: Green bean casserole Ad: Are you suffering from indigestion?
ahhHh this the earliest I’ve ever been!!!
If you were raised Jewish you new how to make matzah balls from Scratch an it was always so good
you perfectly put to words why i love the movie Ratatouille! it always brings me a deep comfort, that’s what cooking does for me too. i try branching out to do new recipes very often and always feel downhearted when it doesn’t go to plan, but going back to those staple favorites is very self-assuring, thank you for the reminder that i don’t have to always be ~*experimenting*~ to be a cook. i also find it hilarious that there’s a comfort recipe i do where i use a matzo ball soup mix as a base, i unfortunately forgo the matzo ball part bcs i could never get it right but i really want to try next time now thanks to that advice you gave! also a good ingredient addition to the soup: buy a rotisserie chicken, tear that sucker apart, and add it into the soup. it really does go into chicken noodle soup territory there but nothing is more satisfying than eating a nice wedge of chicken, heck i think for any recipe that requires chicken just grab a rotisserie chicken! you don’t have to use the skin part and it’s much easier to follow a recipe if you know that part of the equation is dealt with. a very good beginner cook friendly tip! can’t wait to see more videos :)
I love greenbean cassorrol
REMEMBER GUYS AND GALS CAPITAL T =TABLESPOON lower case t = teaspoon
When you brought up TED-talks I only thought of my rendition, Taz-talks because... my name is Taz... it’s dumb I know 😅
As a chef in training this was pleasant  Good job on the safety stuff 👏keep trying it only gets better with time 😘
Wait your not supposed to cut your fingers?
I know how to cook and I'm 10 XD
Did I just see someone wearing an ICS sweater from Haikyuu!
petition for the entire soup time song
i love green casarol
I like how she put a todoroki sticker on the fridge
Oh man, I’m really not good at cooking, my stuff ends up looking...weird
Chipotle that many nights? I've heard horror storys about that....
I cut cheese Pepperoni
do *teaspoon* then double check and add more if needed
My engineering teacher has the same idea about machines as you do with knives. "You want to keep your life right? Don't wear loose clothing near the belt sander."
Holy shot i forgot about this channel
Matzo ball soup is amazing! Also mom would probably kill me if I don't make the Matzo Balls my self! (Whit out the packet)
I love to cook however it took a long time to learn but I learned from my dad
6:26 I see that Todoroki on the fridge. You can't hide :)
2:30 She put in her fursuit
Low key want sum illy sketty sounds bussin rn
You should read food lab by J. Kenji López-Alt if you want to learn more about food
I thought that the best part of matzo ball soup was eating it
Green bean casserole is the bomb! My mom makes a really good one!
Illy, Illy, Illy... you should just add some glu into that cassawol.
Cooking tip for people who are either too busy or overwhelmed by cooking: invest in a big crockpot. It's super easy to cook in because, depending on what you decide to make, you pretty much just dump your ingredients in it in the morning and in 6-8 hours it's done. I am cooking chicken in mine right now. I cook turkey breast for holidays in mine. I make ribs in it! It's delightful and everything is super flavorful and best of all, it's easy!
5:32 look at the Todoroki magnet lol
OMG ILLY
I love the rice on the intro
Wilson from dont starve when he cooks meatballs with ice and raw monster flesh
Man-  I learned how to cook when I was like 5-
I’m telling my food tech teacher we should watch this in class
I added soft butter instead of melted to cookies once and I had to melt the entire mixture. It actually turned out good so... happy accident?
Is no one gonna talk about how this is a whole musical? Like there’s soup time and soup time reprise...
You know that there are cut proof gloves
This is kinda wholesome (but the kinda is silent)
TODOROKI ON THE FRIDGEEEEEEE
I know how to make scrambled eggs and that's it lol
pEpPa wHaT yOu dOIn iN mY sOuP? (Lowkey my favorite part.)
YASSSS GREEN BEAN CASSEROLE
7:58 - Did she just make a Ratatouille musical reference?!
ok we seriously need a extended Soup Time song :3
*_BAKING GLOVES_*
We have green bean casserole in Maryland too!
I have no idea how or when I found you but I’m so happy I’m here
This adorable "adulting" video is great!
My boi is brown I’ve been blessed!
Another easy soup to make is beef barley soup. I use 4 cups beef bone broth, 3 or 4 cans of Campbell's beef consomme, one pound of ground beef or roughly chopped steak, a bunch of mushrooms, carrots, celery, onion, and spinach plus 1/4 to 1/2 cup of quick barley. And add salt and pepper or any seasoning to taste. Just don't make the mistake I made my first time.. adding the whole box to my soup, severely underestimating the absorbative powers of barley. Even with a smaller amount it soaks up all of the broth when you put it away. (It comes back when reheated or you can add another can of consomme)
...what DO taxes taste like?      Meh. I never liked rich food, anyway. 🥁
I can make scrambled eggs
I forgot to add sugar the first time I baked pumpkin pie.
"Soup time, time! OWIEEE"
Illy stop hurting yourself even I’m more careful then you and I’m 9!
Grace Field Meat with Uchiha Tears seasoning? DELICIOUS!
EARLY!!  Anyone see the "Abnormal Chaos and The AMaazing" peoples?
Omg todoroki magnet todoroki magnet TODOROKI MAGNETTTTTT
Matzo Ball Soup is the BEST!!!
i thought this whas a cooking show, not a cooking lesson.
OH MY NOODLES I LOVE MATZO BALL SOUP! My mom makes it all the time and I can agree that it is the homiest tasting thing ever.
me pouring hot water into a bowl: AAAAAHHHHHWJSJNSMWKKXO my mom face planting into it:          *tis but a scratch.*
Idc what anybody says green bean casserole is a masterpiece
I eat so so.muvh cake
Gordon Ramsy could NEVER

I SAW THAT JJK PICTURE!!!! ARE YOU READY FOR THE FINALE OF SEASON 1?!
I once made pork adobo (classic Filipino dish) and I accidentally mistook beef for pork 😂 I was 12 at the time. However I was able to bounce back and use the correct meat. Turned out amazing!
So uh- Is it normal that I can’t make toast :)
I have all my fingers the knife goes chop, chop, chop if I miss the apple I’m cutting my fingers will come off
I LOVE GREEN BEAN CASAROLES
Ratatouille soup.
Seeing other people struggle w seasoning makes me sad. I feel blessed because my Italian ancestors bless me with the ability to season perfectly 😔 my Green bean casserole is DELICIOUS.
Your skeptti is caned skeptti
I can cook and I’m 9
I was making Mac and cheese , put  the wooden spoon on a kitchen towel next to the fire I turned around it smelled like smoke I turned back around and ………… the towel was on fire      MY HOUSE WAS FINE , OK IT WAS FINE MY KITCHEN WAS FINE TOO BUT THAT TOWEL WAS DEAD
Peppa Pig... What are you doing in my soup?🤡🤣😄😁
This made me laugh, thank you
But what if I dont wanna keep my fingers, MAYBE I WANNA BE A CYBORG MOM
I once misread “sugar” for “salt” and put 1 1/2 cups of salt in my brownies instead of a pinch.
Ok I have a baking story, I decided to make some betty crocker blueberry muffins as my first ever recipe by myself, however when I went to put in the milk I accidentally added 2 and a half cups of milk in stead of a half, so I needed to go out and buy 2 more packages to make it work
Illy: I'm not a good cook Me: Girl I have the ability to set the kitchen on fire without even stepping in-
When is that apron gonna be merch?
But illy I hate green beans
1:02 Soup time soup time 🍲☺ 😱 🩸
Maybe Illy has a Ratatouille inside her hair..
“Peppa, what are you doing my soup?” God no
What are you?
oh god...not the green bean casserole
I love how I just see a Todoroki magnet on the fake fridge in the back.😂
not anyone can be a great cook but a great cook can be anyone.
I do own 3 pans
I love this illy
anyone else see their late and their comment won't get noticed but they do it anyway?
“Are a young aspiring professional” bold of you to assume I’m talented
Matzoh ball soup is a super Jewish thing, and whenever we have it on the holidays it’s awesome. Great choice!
Still doing better than me. My version of cooking is "apply heat until edible".
The fact that there is a birthday scene and it’s my birthday makes the video better :)
I’m not bad at cooking, everyone just has bad taste
Cute video! Thankfully, I inherited my grandmother's 'a pinch of that' gene. I never measure pepper, just sprinkle a bit into the food and I'm good. When it comes to pepper and salt, I rarely measure when cooking (but I do err on the side of 'less is more' because I can always add more later if needed).
Sometimes when my mom bakes brownies or a cake she won’t mix the eggs well enough and the eggs will boil in the oven. There will be boiled egg whites in the cake...
I’m no gourmet chef, but I know how to cook a few recipes.
I love it how she first started cooking during college, when lil ol’ me started cooking the second i was able to wiggle my Fingers.
I’m 9 and I make macaroni on my own every day :>
I'll help u
Ah yes cooking Probably the most dangerous thing I do three times a day
NO WAY!!! At the beginning I guess she would say “ Tastes like taxes”
I'm going to use a knife now thanks for the advice
This was fun
My family  never really made green bean casserole but we did make cheesy chicken and broccoli casserole ... so yummy
I like how she is giving cooking tips even tho she is not good at cooking
1:21 me who was born with no fingers: do your worst!

I still love this channel.
The title sounds like me
Just call Gordon Ramsey and hell name you Donut in his contacts
Illy, I saw this triforce magnet on the freezer, did you play Zelda, or are my Eyes wrong? PS: I love you so much, your so talented, nice and FUNNY! I swear, I never liked a YouTube account as much as I like yours❤️ I even got one of your illymationshirts for birthday! I just wanted to say thank you for the entertainment☺️
Ramen’s always something that I love to customize, and add stuff to. That way it’s not too unhealthy, and fills you up.

I added a tablespoon of salt to the cookies instead of a teaspoon one time. Yucky.
This is so funny because I made motza ball soup before I watched this video.
Bro greenbean casserole is bomb as hell
I actually LOVE this. Every video is a gem!
That cat poster is 😌
I'm not a good cook (so I stopped trying)
Potatoes are my favorite crispy cooked food ever like hashbrowns, fries, and fried potatoes so basically cooked in the oven sliced potatoes
3:36 who else she was going to make ratatouille
I am glad to know I'm not the only one how cuts them self on a potato pleader lol
Pls add more sound sfx
Nice
I can cook cake..... that’s. Umm all
Maaz yay
Green bean casserole slams.
I miss green been casserole...I always got some during easter cuz my mom made delicious crunchy onion bits green bean casserole with creamy mushrooms soup <3

I do horse riding lessons and they have a horse named Matsa ball. Now I know why he's named that, it's all makes sense now.
Ooga booga
I didn’t know green green casserole was an exclusively South thing. I wasn’t even sure if the state I live in is technically part of the South
too late i lost 3 of mine fingers
I'm glad you live near a store that sells Uchiha Tears.  They are so hard to find where I live...
everyone is tbh

When I was a kid and in girl scouts, we learned about knife safety by using lipstick. The tune was the handle, and the pigment was the blade. What you got on your hand stood in for if you got cut.
play cooking mama plzzz  just like jadien  animaion
Always remember that you can season things after it cooks so don't go ham.  Growing up in a family that all have different seasonings tastes taught me that real quick.
Hi
Wait you a furry

Matzah ball soup isn't good if it's not made correctly
Basics with Babish is a great starter series.
I can only cook scrambled eggs and boil rice
I did the same mistake that you did with pepper, but salt in cookies
YOU NEED TO READ WARRIORS ITS A BOOK ABOUT CATS THERE ARE 82 OF THEM THEY ARE SOOOOOOO GOOD YOU WOULD LOVE THEM!!!!!!
taxes taste good
I learned how to cook at 8
I love matzah ball soup!!
Green bean casserole is so underrated! It is the best!
Same
She's right about the ' a sharp knife is less dangerous than a dull one' I was in a cooking class, and do have ServSafe Management certification. If you put your thumb, and index finger on each side of the knife spine, just above the handle, it can help with grip so it won't flop around a lot. You are supposed to use the heel of a knife, unless a serrated or a boning knife (which uses only the tip)
So... we're calling them baking gloves now... right?
THOSE DANG POTATO PEELERS
i saw this 3 hours ago but i didn't feel like clicking it

I love the homunculus fma symbol on the fridge. Nice detail.
That plane has an ominous x on the back
i really like how when i feel down i can watch illy's video and i feel WAY better i also love the anime references and little drawings  the animators and your work into this video plus backgrounds look so nice and maaz and you are comedy goal
I can officially say that i am a sub-par chef. I mean not to brag but I could follow baked ziti instructions from my dad to a tee and do pretty good myself at the age of 13.  p.s love your animations
OK BUT CONNIE IN A JAR AT THE END I- 💀💀
Another reason why not to put your knifes in the dishwasher! So when I was 6 or 7 me and my dad were unloading the dishwasher (at the time we put knives in there) I was dealing with the cups and he was doing the EVERYTHING ELSE So he was grabbing stuff then BOOM Knife slipped on the floor cutting his foot open And me being a shorty and crying couldn’t reach the bandaids luckily I had a tall brother who helped Oh that also made me scared of the dish washer for like 5 years
YASS TY FOR POSTIN EEEE
Could I share a recipe that I make for funsies?
No way,my brother shredded his finger while I was making onion rings yesterday😂😂
Being a line cook... I can confirm all the dangers
Exactly how i feel about drawing
I needed this video! I made "Salt and Pepper" shrimp last night.  I watched like 4 videos on how to do it. I was feeling good, confident even.  So, instead of breading the shrimp in corn starch...I used BAKING SODA.  It didn't look right, it didn't feel right, it really didn't smell right.  When I put them in the oil it didn't seem right.  It didn't brown and the shrimp sorta shriveled up.  I finished the all the shrimp, $20 worth of shrimp, and laid them out on paper towels.  That's when it hit me.  But...maybe it wouldn't be too bad right, baking soda is in cake, I like cake.  Oh my god no! No! Turns out baking soda is really salty and acidic and sour and angry and chemically and does not improve with frying.  It was like I fried shrimp in salt and hair spray. So, your video made me feel so much better about my mistake.  But if I'm honest, I'm still a little bit SALTY about it.  Hahahahahahaha...salty. You're awesome!
Bro, becoming a legal adult has just made me realize how STUPID I am 😂
This tips actually helped me a lot :0
wassup
"pEpA wHaT ArE yOU DoInG iN mY sOuP?" lol
As someone who also grew up in The South, I never seen green bean casserole other than on TV during Christmas time.
Some special advice for anyone trying to get into cooking. Look up a proper grip for knives, make sure the knife is sharp, look up the right way to hold your ingredients and don’t try to cut too fine if you’re not comfortable with it. Just 1 5 minute video helped me out so much when I first started
Hve u tried spegetti with alrfradio sauce sorry for the bad spelling but it is good or even better creamy mazio balls soup again sorry for the bad spelling i grew up with that and its so good so yah ive had the kind ur taling about befor and the creamy kind with cream of mushroom soup so good
2:11 if breaking the fourth wall in cartoons be like
dude. i friggin want the Luigi the cat magnettttttt i swear on gAwD.
One of the easiest recipes my mom taught me is carne y patatas I'd love for you to try it it's nice comfort food  You take a pound of ground beef and brown it in a large cooking pot   Then you put in your potatoes they should be sliced into cubes you only need two large potatoes  Then add a small can of tomato sauce I like to use the tomato basil garlic kind   Pour in water until your meat and potatoes are completely covered  Then add cumin powder garlic powder salt and pepper to taste   Let it sit covered for 45 minutes and then it's ready to serve    Hope you try it and enjoy it
im early to an illymation video...woah
My little 10lb rescue loves to "help" people cook, he's not begging for food or anything, he just wants to be near buy. We noticed when he started demanding to go outside with me whenever I would grill. We thought he just wanted to go outside cause he saw the door open and it was warm but all he would do when he got out there was lay on the deck near me. If I went in, he had to come with me. If I went back out, he was right on my heels. It was so cut and so funny that we started calling him my "little sous chef." I think I'm going to *have* to get an apron with his fluffy little face on it.
"Thank you for coming to my ted talk." - Illisa.
Nice shoto fridge magnet
After having a daughter over a year ago I now have to meal plan and cook. its kind of stressful and crazy tbh how do parents do this ish
Omg I love green bean casserole
Thanks for posting! I missed you :)
I always hated green bean casserole. (Dont attack me, Illy.)
PFFT-   “Kinda tastes like taxes”  -illymation 2021
Cool
I wanna be a chef when I’m older and this really inspired me and i shall use this determination you gave me to keep moving forward thank you.
This thumbnail has peanuts gang energy and I LOVE it
Respect for that jujutsu kaisen reference
2:49 look at the magnets all of them don't have any detail but then you see the todorki
Oml peppa memes I remember those :)
I love the expression on Todoroki's face in the background he just SCREAMS "what is this woman doing..."
As someone who’s also from the south (TN) one of the hardest things you can make is fried chicken 🧍‍♀️ seriously it’s such a delicate process and uh..yeah...especially over the phone instructions are even harder.
*Flashbacks of culinary school* -Elise
for my fellow matzo balls (and jazz?) enthusiasts, might i suggest giving the song "matzo balls" by Slim Gaillard a little listen. it slaps. that's all
The anime References are amazing The Jujutsu Kaisen ones are awesome!!!
I like this
The backrounds!!!! I love all the anime back there 😁❤👌
Tip: Get an air fryer. Is the easiest thing in the world
ngl i'm a fking GOD cook i could give you lessons All u'd need 2 do is fly to Australia and i got u

Love your content!
Matzo ball soup is the BOMB
0:36 Me sitting outside a Chipotle o-o
But I like my fingers
I already don't have all my fingers that I was born with... Apparently six fingers are no no in maternity ward. :(
This is so adorable, I just want to reach out to you and give you my knowledge
2:29 it’s confirmed... she’s a furry
Peppa what are you doing in my soup
Matzo Ball soup is like my soul food soup
I loved cooking with my dad when I was younger like 4-10 maybe. I don’t as much anymore but I feel like I should. I get to spend time with my dad and learn cooking skills to impress friends when I go to college lol
having experience of horeca, i'm good on this one
Aha just today I got four stitches from cutting open a juice box Be safe kids
Me and my family have something similar to mozza ball soup but called butter ball soup
kinda early! haven't watched the video yet, but i wanted to say that i love you and your content B')
I learned how to cook when I was a kid... i didn't have a choice because my family was poor
I think you’re the only other person I’ve seen that watches jjk
Illy’s back, and she’s as relatable as ever
*watches video, realizes I'm not subscribed yet for some reason despite binging your videos*....*hits subscribe button and turns bell on* :D  Also, like, you hit the cooking struggles on the head. That matza(spelling???) ball soup sounds delicious! I love matza! And soup! I want to try it! I'll have to remember this video once I get my own place and cookware and everything! Soooo close, yet so far....couple months to go. At least I may have a place. :)
As a northerner, green bean casserole is the BEST
You can use golden potatoes and you can eat the skin
I love cooking! On Bon Appetit's website they have a basically section full of easy to follow recipes with 10 ingredients or less. Check it out and don't stop trying to be a better cook!
This art style is great
i love cooking
Anyone catch the Jujetsu Kaisen reference here if ya did not catch it it is the painting in the background  8:06
My mom: come on! Do the food   Me: mom I’m going to burn myself
your the best:)
e
You dropping the knife at 3:01 gave me anxiety
Hitler cat?
Hey Illy, if you don't know what to cook, then try Hello Fresh or Blue Apron, they send you recipes and ingredients weekly and it's a lot cheaper than going on a grocery run. You can choose what kind of meal options you want and what meals you want to cook. My personal favorites are probably Hello Fresh's "Italian Chicken and Pepper Sandos with Potato Wedges" and the "Velvety Mushroom Prosciutto Chicken with Scallion Mashed Potatoes & Roasted Broccoli" (I take out the mushrooms because that's just me). The meals are pretty good, they don't take very long to make, and they are cheap. 4 meals a week is $80, that's cheaper than most grocery store runs.
If you see this comment you must write a supportive comment for illy
Hey illy do you think you could explain how you use your programs because I can’t figure it out so could you try and do that oh yeah are you going to vid on 2021
The animation is so cute            \(>♡<)/
I've only seen ONE other person comment about the anime references in the background-
Im young and I can cook gormet dishes
Its okay illysa we as a supporting  subscribers are going to helping you cook. Cooking can be hard, but the more you learn and practice it can be easy. (WARNING: Im not a professional chef)If following a recipe don't go risking overseasoning or go outside of the rules (unless if do by taste ) it can bring unwanted or displeasing taste, Cook something that you enjoy, like, or wanna try, Please have the appropriate cooking utensils for your recipe that your following, and when cooking please pay a attention to your food because they can burn, overscorched,or overcook ( depending on what your making).
I saw the video in my recommendations and said: yes
i dont know what type of matzah ball soup you had but with pesach coming it its nOT a thing i want to be reminded of-  (i dont like it in case you couldnt tell qwq)

Guuuurl I love this channel
This video is so relatable because I wanna become a chef when I grow up and I am starting to get good at cooking at the age of 11
Yay! Good video.
This video has really great mentor/parent vibes and as a stupid baby who literally panics whenever water boils, I really really liked it. Thanks Illy!!!
no problem i am too
Idk what to comment so imma just say  E
I made an omelet with no recipe the other day. It had like 4 ingredients, tasted pretty good to me so uhh, not a fail I guess.
6:18 Throwback
I'm only referring to oven mitt as baking gloves from now on
me eating chipotle while watching this
The weird thing with me is that I can bake pretty well (I've even won a bake-off) but I can't cook dinners to save my life. Maybe it's because there's less incentive to cook dinners that are just average and there's more incentive to bake things that make people smile.
Mmh Kay mmh Kay But like Wedding soup.
Green bean casserole is DELICIOUS!!!!!
You should check out @johuwa weissman   he is a chef and he teaches you how to cook and my personal favorite vedios is how to make cheese sticks
That thumbnail thou
Yo you just reminded me how much I love matzo ball soup
I know maaza ball soup is a traditional Jewish dish but it sounds very similar to a traditional Polish dish(kumla) just curious but are the 2 related?Sirius question. Thanks in advance
She doesn’t post often, but when she does, ‘tis a blessing.
2:45 shameless mercy plug... lol
YAY YOUR BACK FOR THE DEAD
Me when using hot oil: *scared as heck that I'm gonna burn myself* My mom using hot oil: *acting like its just cold water*
*sooop time sooop time gonna make some sooop crimes*
"*gasp* Peppa??!! what are you doing in my soup..."
Why is the channel called includes paid content
Finally! I am early just- 2 hours early
I can cook some thing but not all foods
I had a *HORRIBLE* day and words CANNOT EXPRESS how HAPPY this made me
If you like matzo ball soup she would def like albóndigas 😎
Me a 11 year old, who know has to cook an egg: *Pathetic*
Todoroki magnet!
Remy is evil!
"I first tried cooking in college" it's moments like these I'm glad I grew up with many siblings and had to cook a lot to help my parents. Propably one of the best abillities to have.
*laughs in leftie*
what's a "matzo ball" ?? doesn't exist here and i have no idea what it is xD
3:00 ''i know how to hold a knife now''  immediately drops knife on foot
Hissss! XD
Steps that can make you a great chef and have some delicious dishes  1: you need to saw ratatouille  2:be safe 3: have a military knife  4: don’t scream when you cut your hand  5: subscribe to illymation  6:see tutorials of Gordon Ramsay  7: don’t be a cartoon character
I cant make tacos ;  -   ;
I love to cook and when I saw this video it was like heaven in my head
A girl at the park once asked me if I played with knifes. I was 11
I do wanna add that even if you just take a bunch of canned or pre-made ingredients and cooked them, you still cooked. if you are just cooking for yourself, you don't have to make everything super fresh. you don't have to go and wrestle your own chicken or anything like that. Also, learn to cook pasta. it's cheap and it gives a lot. the hardest part of that is knowing how to not overcook it, but it's not super hard. and by cook pasta, I don't mean making your own. just by whatever suits your fancy. i like Bow Ties :3
Additional tip for the knife use: glide the knife along the front of your fingers, along the middle section with the higher knuckle touching what you're cutting. Goes back to what Ily said about curling fingers
wait a damn minute the apron is  water proof but its washable?......I'm confused?
Cooking. An actually useful skill they teach u at scout camp.
Hah! I'm only 10 and I know how to cook french fries. (My 7yo brother helps me peel the potatoes)
Its awesome
I would not be allowed to cook if there were was a law that you have to be decent
as a jew, i am IN with the matzo ball soup, so when Passover comes, I eat. And passover is coming. And I will. EAT.
turning on the stove is so scary
The Full-metal Alchemist references are great
So is it weird that I'm 13 and i know how to use a any kind of knife perfectly because i skinned a a cow and goat for food. I know I'm weird😐
Lilymation:this is how you make matzo ball soup!   me: wondering if lilymation likes my hero acidaemia
I LOVE YOUR CHANNEL
HI ILLY!
Gordon ramsay could never
I’m younger than her and I know how to cook better than her!😂😅(no offense love your vids!)
Matzo ball soup is fantastic!! My mom makes it with carrots, celery + shredded up rotisserie chicken :,)
4:39 jujutsu kaisen reference
3:00 you dropped the knife
Omg hey I thought u died or something
8:10 as long as you have the money, the ingredients, the many pots and pans you need (if your doing some thing extra, like cheesecake with a spring pan) the time to cook, the time to do the dishes afterwards, the confidence to have something cook over night in a slow cooker for example, and the list goes on. just get a simple cook book, make something simple, and you'll how many dishes it takes to make something *small* and *simple*
Todoroki is a magnet on her fridge @ 3:38
The green bean casserole story reminded me of this time my dad was trying out a new method of doing chicken, and accidentally added way more pepper than he needed, so when the chicken was ready, the sauce was PURE BLACK, like, major cooking flaw there, and when we tried it, I was the only one able to not choke on the stuff, but even then, the pepper was overpowering. so we tried to remove the pepper individually and managed to repair the recipe for next time
1:01 better than justin beiber
5:22 OKAY 100% she is correct here if anyone sees this go get materials for matzo ball soup its the freaking bomb, its cheap (any time accept when nearing passover) and delicious especially because all it really needs is the matzo balls its amazing!
*sees the behind the scenes* this is getting out of hand, now there are two of them!
I saw the thumbnail and flashed back to 3 weeks ago where I set fire to my kitchen trying to set up frying oil 😅 This video resonates with me on a personal level 😁
when she's caring for us 😫‼️
Ive been cooking since i was seven WITH knives
Small tip for anyone that is still in school and has at least one or more years before you graduate: Try having one of your classes be some kind of cooking class, might come in handy
I love green bean casserole! It is one of the best dishes at Thanksgiving!
i bet im a better cook than you cuz i knew everything you said in the video and more and im ten XD
This video really helped cheer me up. Thank you.
shOTO!!
Illy: Makin some dope & tasty soup Potato: Exists in recipe Illy: *Potato Vietnam Flash Backs*

Me FaceTiming my bestie:  Her: I’m making buffalo chicken dip!  Me: *on my way*
PEPPA WHY U IN MA AOUP
I horrible at cooking as well I’m trying to improve my mom wants me to watch her cook which I probably should do but no I must try doing everything by my self and almost durn down the kitchen
*laughs in I used a knife since I was five and never cut myself*
3:06 out of contexts
Illy hit me up ill show you how to make amazeballs eggs
You should learns some Risotto recipes, its easier than people think, I help my mom make it all the time  Edit: I know it's easy because I'm not the best cook and even I can make good Risotto!
4:23 I used to do this a surprising amount when baking. So now I have a notes checklist of the exact amounts I need of everything that I check off one by one and while its slightly more tedious I am much better at not doing that now lol
I can't do no onions.
*i see the jujutsu picture in the background lolz*
No one believes me but the steam on top of a pot is HOT and the fire is SCARY
I want me some baking gloves
There have been times where i messed up. One night i made burgers buuut they were a lil underdone
You’re so cute in braids omgg
illy:*likes remy the rat* me*watch film theory on remy* me:my child don't trust the rat
illy forgot to say you can add but you cant remove in cooking very important and also put a moist rag under your cutting board so it won't move like a fish
Illy: "if your feeling less Remy the rat and more Linguini the human-" Linguni: 😢
TODOROKI ON THE FRIDGE 😆😍🤩
Wow
Now I’m hungry
3:00 I love the little joke of knife holding and then dropping sharp side down
one of the most wholesome sponsor video ive seen :3 and that apron is water resistant holy moly
I wouldn't know that you aren't perfect in the kitchen because..... I no stalker. :P
As a new york jew, matzo ball soup is so fucking good omg u got tasteeee
I got cut by a knife 2 times with the same knife
Illy, my grandmother makes a legendary Matzo-Ball soup! She was so happy to see a “young person” talking about matzo balls. She adores your animation style btw!
"And this is where I really feel like Remy the ratatouille, the rat of all my dreams" Me: **gasp** Oh y e s, that's a cultured person right there
My home ec teacher watching this:  👁👄👁
The dude sounds like max. From sam and max.
That chipotle bathroom scene is TOO real! Got me questioning my life choices lmao 😆
Me: *tries to cut slowly and carefully because I need all of my fingers*  My mom: WHY ARE YOU CUTTING SO SLOW-
I peeled the whole top of my thumb off when I was like 8 or 10. It took so long to heal.
ratatouille obviously lied about sumthin-
Green bean casserole: wack Squash casserole: snack
“peppa! what are you doing in my soUp?”
hi ilyssa! you made my day when you posted
I have a home and career teacher and she would agree with this information.Good Job
I've had green bean casserole so many times as someone who lives in the midwest  And I can safely say I very much don't like it— great for you if you do tho!
Oh look she's back, how was your "nap"
Matzoball soup is being called „Grießknödelsuppe“ here in Germany! It’s really delicious and it’s being made very often ! So you got a good taste illy !
I *can* cook (and pretty damn well if I do say so myself); I just often don't because...crippled.   Frozen meals and Uber Eats are my BFFs for that reason. (btw, thanks for that note on how to make matzo balls that are vegan!)
to the 33 ppl who disliked this video... everything ok at home?
Honestly I’m a picky eater so the easy food is what I live off. Because it’s all I can eat 🥲
International food aisle? That some fancy stuff that we do not have here ;-; I wish we did
6:22 That one meme, I never thought I'd hear again..........           *PePpA, wHaT aRe YoU dOiNg In My CoMmEnT*
I am actually a really good cook, and one day I am hoping to study business and own my own restaurant! 🥘
I LOVE MATZO BALL SOUP SO MUCHHHHH!!!
"square Maaz isn't real he can't hurt you"   *Square Maaz:*
I don't understand the video but I love it ❤️👄❤️
Knives scare me dude How I cook
The apron is sooo cute😍
So it IS just like Breath of the Wild. Now where am I gonna find a bull....?

my dad has a cooking degree so i think im set he will teach every thing he knows
I'M HERE FOR THE CHAOS
Be sure to remember to get the milk eggs and cheese that are on your fridge
ok, but we need Soup time on Spotify... Like it was really good.
epic
"Illy Mart" lol
Illy chops hand off Me: *internal screaming*
Funny how she talks about Matzah Ball Soup a lot and this came out close to Passover.
As a Jewish person, I can’t explain how happy it makes me that matzo ball soup is getting the recognition it deserves 🤩
GET BACK IN YOUR SECTION GET OUT!! OUT!! WHERE THE LAMB SAUCE!!!!!!!
STOP COOKING YOU ARE MAKING ME HUNGRY 😂😭♥️ Me:*getting peanut butter and jelly sandwich* i want soup now.
I'm literally eating noodles everyday except for wednesdays and saturdays when I eat fries. Problem is, that I don't like a lot of food (meaning a lot of food literally makes me gag which I recently found out is not normal?), so there are not really many dishes I actually could make. For example, I don't like any sauce at all, so I just eat plain noodles, maybe with some sort of meat, but on seperate plates. That's literally just putting noodles in hot water/putting meat in a pan and wait. So yeah, that's pretty much everything I am capable of.
POYO
Don’t lie we all are either underage and can’t cook or just can cook at all 👇
I love cooking and making smoothies
Like a cat or like Luigi
Ok sooo that jujutsu kaisen drawing is sooo fireee
Hi
3:00 why does it look like Moonkitti is on your apron?
Illy? Talking about matzoh ball soup? Right before passover??? Nice
U will not beat me in the top 10% of chipotle orders
I was playing wordscapes while watching this and while I found the word love Alisa said love I thought that was pretty weird
Ily who can't handle a potato peeler:  Me a 12yo who made three grilled cheese sandwiches last night at 3:29AM because I was bored:You aint got nothing on me
Dang, you  look like you weren't ready for the Chaos...
I’m always late but those math homework really can’t wait! Oh man Ilyssa did some new shit i can’t wait to watch it!
she has skin
RAW!!!
For the longest time I thought I didn’t like cooking. My family haver never had a tradition of cooking, I don’t have those “grandma food is best food” kind of memories. Then I met my girlfriend and she started teaching me a lot of stuff and then I realized that I what I actually hate is cooking for myself and / or alone. Cooking with / for her is the best!
This brought back the memory of when I was baking a cake when I was 12 and my cake was kinda raw so I put it back into the oven for a few minutes. When I went to take the cake out from the oven, I used the oven mitt that had a hole in it and burned my finger. I was dumb so I put the cake on a ceramic plate instead of a cake pan. So I touched a ceramic plate that was in a 350 degree oven. My parents were not pleased
It's genuinely impossible for me to cook.
I love how Maazes glasses are just so reflective you can't see his eyes :D Such a nice detail
Wow, YouTubes really getting comfortable with those none skip-able adds-
In two days is Passover
I wonder what
Cooking 101: How not to cut your fingers off
I'm just reminded of the time I tried this cake that one of my friends in my use-to-be friend group make. It was for one of the girl's birthday and it was a yellow cake. I love desserts so I tried it and it was the most dense and dry cake I've ever tasted in my life. I tried to wash it down with some tea another lady made and the tea was so bland and weak. How can someone mess up tea? And the frosting on the cake had to be home made because it was just so grimy and tasted like I was eating little grans of sand. I took the cake home and gave it to my mom to try and she tried it and says, "Throw it outside for the birds. This is the worst cake I've ever had in my life."
ILLY ARE YOU JEWISH OHMYGOD??????????????
She’s so talented like HOW DO U ANIMATE LIKE THAT
Hi Illy🤩 (sorry if the name is wrong)
i had a preschool teacher that always said " the knife doesn't care if it's your finger or the apple"
My go-to dishes in my first year of college was Italian Fried Chicken (basically chicken tenders with Italian seasoning) with any type of pasta.
How to cook  Step one: *injury*
IS your animator really from Bulgaria
Illy telling us how to make food while me eating half frozen pizza because I didn’t heat it up well
Perfect in time for Passover. Matzo ball soup is THE BOMB!
I love all the memes in this it’s amazing. The Jujutsu Kaisen reference really made me happy too!
Im more confident in my baking than my cooking. I made so many amazing chocolate chip cookies all by following the same recipe while changing up the different kinds of chocolate chips. As for cooking, most of the food I cook can easily be made in an air fryer or in the oven, so it's all easy for me! In your face!
You can cook they said Youll keep all your fingers they said
I can cook but I'm terrible in measuring ingredients so my mom helps me I do the chopping the pounding and the boiling also the cutting mostly everything but never the measurements of the spices until this day
Peppa what are you doing in my soup ? 🤔
Illy you should get an INSTANT POT! it’s so helpful and really fast for cooking things like rice and even (in some instances) chicken!
Idk about you guys but im pretty attached to my fingers
I like to think I'm a decent cook. When it's meat. And noodles. I can really only make Hamburger Helper
Basically Illy telling everyone to still have fingers for half of the video.
I love green bean casserole! It tastes amazing!
I don’t know what to say so...hi illy!😊
Cook pop check on soup memes 🍗🍟🧆
5:03 You cannot hide that BNHA reference from me!
where Is biscuit I need a biscuit update 👀
Nice imma try matzo ball soup bc it sounds delicious
Sorry I’m late I in school
Storytime: I was in charge of turning on the oven once because my mom was teaching me. I was 9. Since we had a gas stove it does the little clicking when you turn it on. When I had THOUGHT I turned the oven on, I had done the thing where it's hot but there are no flames on! I did not realize this for about 5 minutes until my mom said: "Vivien, did you turn the oven on?" I said yes and we both realized it was releasing gas and if we had a candle near it, our house would catch on fire. 0_o. MORAL OF THE STORY KIDS, ALWAYS MAKE SURE THAT FLAMES ARE COMING OUT OF YOUR GAS STOVE.
Contributing to the discussion* Personally it helped me in cooking to ALWAYS gradually season. So that means adding seasonings little by little and tasting all the way to perfection Remember you can always easily fix an under seasoned dish, but its almost impossible to fix an over seasoned one
I don’t cook ether.
George: *stares at chonky bacon*  Me; *Gasp* Geeooorge why are you checking out your sister.
Once in high school during a foods lab my friend cut her finger badly while cutting tomatoes, if you injure yourself during a foods lab you could fail so we just hid it and used the bloody tomato’s
luv this illy, your the best
My parents want me to take knife handling lessons. My dad has had, let’s just say injuries
Yes you finally uploaded
I almost burned the house down forgetting I put the fork in the microwave. Anyways keep up the good work
My cat is named MITTENS
i aint no cook, but i make a meeeeeeeeeeeean grilled cheese sandwich. and yes, i butter both sides.
Illy explaining the soup ME: whell... i can cook sausages.....
I’m gonna binge watch the heck of this :3
Ngl, i'm hooked on illymation vids and i lowkey wanna animate myself now XD
Fun fact mantzo ball soup is called baksok in Indonesia and is very common in my counry and like all of my family LOVES ITTT
hi illymation i've been watching you on my t.v. i just wanted to say hi, and my sister isn't a good cook either XD
Story time :  One dark Thursday evening ( in my time) I search for illumination and going OUT  she posted an hour ago and I watched it and I laughed and I was happy okay the end :)
i cut my finger with a knife 1st time i tried cooking, i was not fine
Instructions unclear I got food poisoning.
As a Southern-dweller, she's completely right about the green bean casserole. It just hits different as an adult. XD

*PePpA piG WhAt aRe YoU dOiNg iN mY sOuP?*
I literally just attempted fluffy soufflé pancakes and ended up making the most disgusting egg concoction I’ve ever tasted. I’m alright cooking meat dishes and stuff, but baking is just way out of my league.
peppa~ what are you doing in my soup peppa ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
You should stream when you cool, sounds fun ngl
“Soup time song”                    ADORABLE
Ily just YEETED maaz out! NO PUNS!
I can make brownies
Your probably your better than me my munches or like TRASH!!!!!!
im only 14 but i know how to make pork cutlet for no reason (mostly cuz im sad)
Relatable in the first 1min lol
Me always sharpening my knives before I cook O.O... can't relate
Lily’s comfort dish cookbook?
I bet you 50 bucks that people will want you to turn the soup song into a full actual song
I love matzah ball soup it’s a really special dish in my family and I’m glad more people are making them!
Just had a fight with my mom so thanks for making me feel better<3
So happy she posted !
what do you mean a cooking rat won't help me out with cooking?
I'm actually very lucky that I love cooking, and am learning it a lot, so i think i'm prepared for that, taxes on the other hand...
my cat is a better cook then me and every time my dad cuts meat he puts his paws way to close to that dull knife
Happy Passover Illy!!! Have a wonderful holiday weekend!!
Not me hunched over on the couch shoveling spaghettios into my mouth straight from the can
While watching this, I was eating green beans.
THIS WAS SOOOO FUNNYYY
Can you please make a soup song cause then I will be jamming to that song ever day
dont worry illy, only mothers can
Love the way she says Matzaball.. 😂😂😂 Hilarious.
OMG ive never been this early illymation is my fav youtuber i wish one day i can go to a convetion to meet her
I like the soup time song
Ahaha nice video
Illy is encouraging us to cook     while I cant even turn on the stove without burning myself 👁️👄👁️
6:32  one word:   S C H M A L T Z
I own no pot bc it is illegal 🤠
I like how I'm watching a video on cooking when I literally am too afraid to heat my Chefboyardee can of Spaghetti in anything BUT the microwave...
I love cooking but I am young so m mom always is paranoid when I cook
As a new adult who can’t cook..... I thank you for this validation.
uchiha tears pwp     I dont know why but, i wanna go there-
Soup
sorry about the volcano in your toilet after chipotle
Jujutsu Kaisen Cameo 4:35
Is isss is a soup.......
This may be PrEsUmPtUoUs of me but HAVE youve been watching aNiMe lately?
Eh, it's ok.
pov: you click this video at light seed
We NEED a full version of Soup Time
Considering I've started baking more and more lately, the apron thing is super appreciated since I kinda don't have one at all. Now time to overthink on the design and eventually wind up not actually getting the thing cuz I'm too indecisive
I love her energy!(and the ratatouille references)
We need merch of that apron ASAP Edit: just at the end of the video, now you need a link to their shop in your merch store.
Broooo, I have so much anxiety when I share my cooking lol
I love cooking and baking, it feels nice when people enjoy what I cook. :)
Did you make Mack sticks
Sorry I m late
Illymations on a toilet isn’t real, she can’t hurt you. Illymations on a toilet: 0:31
You can avoid most of these rules if you hate your fingers.
The soup-time song is my new anthem  (Also, I love how this vid gives genuine cooking advice as well)
yay
Funny XD
One time I was cutting an apple with a sharp knife, not a baby one, a sharp one and sliced my finger
I BET matzo balls soup IS like the best thing she make that will the best think I will EVER make~
Funny
Literally cut my finger with a potato peeler while watching this video whilst peeling a potato
The bomb . Com 🤣
i burnt my hand makeing pizza rolls
Me : Bruh help I just got scared by putting the fries in the oven cuz it’s hot...
7:24 *Passover steak
PePpA
QnA please
Got a tornado warning watching this
Cool dude
Your style of backrounds is getting so much richier. I like the abstract textures that add much depth to the animation. Reminds of the Song of the Sea
Illy  : cuts her finger with a peeler   Me : Hah weakling
I SAW THAT POWERPUFF GIRLS REFERENCE ILLY!
I love this, although I feel it's a little ironic that you said "wham bam Christmas Ham" when talking about Matzah Ball soup when it's a Jewish food and most Jews don't eat ham or celebrate Chrismtas lol!  Happy Passover though! The best time for Matzah Ball soup!
Can you give me some recipes? Id love to make this
I can cook cookies in a microwave :D
Hey love the jujutsu kaisen in the background
If I cook I am a danger for me and my surrounding. I will learn it some day
the fact you talked about matzo balls near Passover makes this a Passover special
Mmmmmmm delicious a new upload
Another awesome video...great work illy
Bruh if Gordon Ramsay went in my kitchen he would be screaming, rummaging through my spice cabinet and fridge saying: "WHERES THE lAmB sAuCeEeE"
I love how she has Shoto Todoroki and Shigeo Kageyama magnets on her fridge
0:53 Don't want to be mean but I though that were beans not potatoes
2:30 gasp  Illyis a furry!!
This is so cute!
But like we need "Soup Time" on spotify.
1:22 the butterfly knife flippers XD
6:07 is that todoroki in the fridge?lol
I'm jewish and matzahs ball soup is a very big part of our culture and I'm glad you like something like this and that's so important to us and the holiday that it have especial value to it starts on Friday
It’s cool if you can’t cook most people don’t learn till they like 16 and if you don’t it’s chill
I cut my finger one time when I was cutting sweet potatoes but thankfully it wasn’t deep enough for stitches 😅 It healed after a week or so
Hello is only a a peticion: You can tell your president to give us back Texas?
Illy: That’s a weird filling. Kinda tastes like taxes Me: Laughing so hard
0:03 no, especially that last part 0:07 also no, I don’t own much, I’m a teen 0:12 probably, but I don’t want to admit it
i get nervous when i turn on the stove but thats just because of a little thing called  °⨳°·..·°⨳°⊹٭ _Anxiety_ ٭⊹°⨳°·..·°⨳°
Peppa what are you doing in my soup 🤨  Peppa:👁 👁                 👄
she is a whole ass mood
6:03    Lol. The papa john's bit caught me off guard. I spit my gatorade 🤣
So I don't know how much green bean casserole you made exactly, but I'm surprised that 1/4 teaspoon vs 1/4 tablespoon of black pepper was enough to make such a huge difference in flavor. But then I also like black pepper a lot, so...
I cook a lot and I'm 10 and people say I'm a really good cook and I don't believe them :^
“Oh Peppa what are you doing in my soup?" Reference of TheAmaazing? He said it whit cereal but it's similar
illy: matzo ball soup is amazing  me, a jewish person: *vibrating with excitement at a very high frequency* yeah it's pretty good  (also passover is coming which means MATZO BALL SOUP IS COMING)
When I make something and it's delicious, I feel so accomplished and get a boost of confidence
I miss my mom's matzo ball soup. My parents always called it the jewish chicken soup, and before anyone tries to come for me, my dad's family is Jewish.
My moms food is better then any other cook and my dad knows how to make all types of meats on the grill. I mean I cooked pretty good stake for my parents guests at a party s   I mean If you tasted the stake..   you would be hungry for more
Green bean casserole's love spreads to the mid-west. 🤤
Passover is coming soon. I have a matzo ball soup excuse now.
I’m 11 and the good thing is that my dad is was a cook I think
Finally!! Showing Matzo Ball Soup the love it deserves!! ❤️❤️❤️
gamer
"i know how to hold a knife now" *drops knife*
3:00 ‘Alright, I got a band-aid. I know how to hold a knife now, so-‘ *let’s sharp knife fall on feet*
I am very uncomfortable with the amount of times you said B A L L S
Hii
I eat  chicken noodle soup every day wether I’m sick or not
I have already rewatched this 5 times Now 6 Now 7 Now 9 Now 12 I can't stop
Yeeeeeesss! ✨I'm back for the chaos!✨☺️
I am so bad at cooking i burnt premade pizza in the microwave and chocolate i loved the todoroki sticker on the fridge
Do yall use BAKING GLOVES or OVEN MITS
Hi
First time I made soup I put in 5 large carrots. It was really sweet. I was 12.
Hi
Ratatouille!
I 100% thought that was an ad at the start
A new illymation video! Oh heck yeah for 10 minutes and 50 seconds my day just got better
Green bean casserole SLAPS so hard omfg
Hey
It feels like Illy is threatening us every time she says something about fingers.
omg finnally a new video! yay!
It is time to cook😊😊
Green bean casserole is the best part of holiday dinners and my mind cannot be changed
I can’t believe I got here after an hour! I’m like your biggest fan!!!
I hold a knife like a pencil cause that's how I hold everything- now I know
YESSSSS matzo ball soup is the bomb It's honestly fantastic comfort food
Ah but isn't that the beauty of cooking lilly? You mess up and you learn. You learn and improve all the while sharing something amazing with the people around you. You keep chipping away lilly I'm sure your meals will be amazing
Matzo ball soup!! May I ask if you celebrate Passover? I make it every year for the holiday and it's great :)))
All of question in The beginning yes yes no
hi ill
BRO, Matzo ball soup is the bomb
6:18 I did not expect that XD
I've never had Matzo Ball Soup before but I have had Green bean Casserole and this might sound dumb but I used to love eating it over the Thanksgiving Turkey when I was a kid
I like food
hewo it me i cant even toast bread without  burning it.
I love matzah ball soup, my mom used to make it almost every Passover and I love seeing other people enjoying it! I love matzah ball soup 🤤
Hi! illy! Can I please have a shout out I have been subscribe for a year and a half now? If not it's fine..
Hi
I try to cook but I end up screaming like a little girl when the oil just pops
2:10 ohhhh! *looks at arm stub* so THAT'S why it's not working!
HEY ILLY IM FROM BRAZIL AND YOUR VD ARE THE BEST
I’m literally watching this right after I just burnt myself with the oil 😂😭
They have Illymitts
Great Video i had a good time i love the simple cute art
I caught you with that ratatouille musical reference
Peppa...
Omg yes you’re back ❤️
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEEN
The anime references in the background are immaculate.
I MISSED YOU <3 WELCOME BACK
A couple weeks ago, I was making a macaroni and cheese cup in the microwave. I forgot to add the water, and when I put macaroni and cheese in the microwave, I smelled smoke. Turns out, if my mom didn’t take the cup out earlier, I would have set the house on fire! But it was okay! But I like to bake! And I’m kind of good at it!
I’ve never been this early!!
We love the princess and the frog references!
so many hearted comments
Illy: Eats Cake Also Illy: Hmph, That's weird .. kinda tastes like taxes
My grandma cut her finger and she need stitchs but it wasn't in a dangerous but it would stop bleeding and she is still cooking at a restaurant
I’m from the South and I was genuinely surprised anyone might not like green bean casserole 😂
I love that one of your friends wears a sweater in the collors of the dutch flag (red-white-blue).
Dude I'm to paranoid to touch a pan when the stove is on even though I touch toast as soon as it pops out of the toaster
“Thankfully im a cartoon character and with the magic of animation i can grow my hand back, but you can’t do that in real life ok  >:(“  Me: “Oh yeah well i’ll show u >:(“
3:55 Green beans are the LIFE!!!
Peppa~...
HI ILYSSA
She back yayy👍👍👍👍
My dad is a chef when I was little I was around a lot of kitchens and bars I grew up around bars for a lot of my life now that I think about it and knowing so many chefs didn't help my cursing anyways I made fries at the age of 5 multiple time garlic fries just good old stalt and pepper you name it I did it with potatoes and now I'm 13 and can make steak and chicken 70% of the time
ive never been more entertained by someone gushing about matzo ball soup lmao
I am watching this unable to eat because my teeth got taken out
Illy! Your just like me! I absolutely LOVE celery!
Here's another cooking tip: Remember if you already turned the stove on or off before slamming your hand on it because you're a idiot.
No one  Not a soul on in this universe  Mazz: Ewww green beans in casserole!? YuCKy WuCkY!
If it makes you feel any better, I named my kitten after Luigi lol
Not just the south, Minnesota had it made with the green bean casserole as well
This is only really an Indiana thing but.... TACO SOUP
🎵Soup Time, Soup Time, gonna get a pot for some Soup Crimes . . .🎵 My favorite part! 😂
Turtle . .. ..,..
I'm okay-ish with the stove, but I HATE the oven. You have to get too close to the hot metal to put things in or take them out, so whenever I'm baking with my sister, I make her take stuff out most of the time.
Is it sad that I’m younger then my brother and he is sorta afraid of cooking anything with oil?  Then there’s me: Hmmmm....I should probably be cautious around this bacon cooking and put on a apron.....NOPE IMA WEAR SHORTS AND A T-SHIRT! And yet is still never get BURNED!? Idk man... but anyways when you messed up on the pepper I was like: “WHY DID GET A UGLY LOOK FROM MY MOM WHEN I PUT TO MANY EGGS IN THE CAKE!?” Luv the vid btw <3
Yeah, cooking might look scary. But it's so rewarding when it's done. Actually breath of the wild inspired me to cook more =3
GREEN BEAN CASSEROLE IS AWESOME
I remember for Christmas last year (2019) my mom taught my brother and I how to use a wok to make stir fry... lemme tell ya, its freaking scary at first because of the oil and the sizzling and the popping- but it was interesting. And also very good, so it was worth it. 8/10 if you don't get oil popped on you.
Mood
THIS- I- IM DEADDDDD
once on christmas eve i just about cut off my finger, i was trying to open a bag of muffin mix with a foot long knife (don’t ask why if how) and i had 6 stitches in my finger on christmas. that was fun.
As someone who tried to cut themselves on a daily basis, I can understand the disappointment whenever you fail at a dish. But, as you said, you remember the dishes that you were able to make well and it makes you feel a little better.  Also I injured myself to working a potato peeler. Only I nearly took off my entire nail. It was not a pleasant experience
Who else spot the Todoroki on The fridge😂😂😂😂
Whoever dislikes this video is an *******
Have you made......   *Mac-sticks?*  (Dramatic music)
Literally ate matzoh ball soup while watching this. My mom started adding parsnips and turnips and OMG IT'S LIKE EATING A HUG!!! YUUUUUM!!!
brb, making matzo ball soup
Gordon Ramsay is terrified of chef Luigi
I know how to cook different dishes by the age of 13 and from that day on I cooked and still cook our food from breakfast to dinner and it sucks especially when you need to finish homeworks
I loved the soup cooking crime song 😂
rumor has it, illy gave peppa pig a hot tub of SOUP
Who the HECKIE HECK doesn't like green bean casserole???
YOOOOO JUJUTSU KAISEN REFERENCES?
FOOD IS FOOD
Never trust me with a Kitchen with everything. I am butter fingers.🤗
I watched this at school
I will never understand the American obsession with cooking mixes
YES, matzah ball soup is SO GOOD!!! My stepdad and aunt both make it and I love it every time! Thanks for making this video, I am in the "is old enough to use the stove but is still afraid of it for some reason" camp but I am trying ^.^
I kind of wanna know what other southern food illy grew up on  The only real one I know cause my grandma made it, squirrel and dumplings, and kind of homemade food like fish, pumpkin and apple pies, things like that
Oh my gosh I peeled my thumb once too 😅 I'm a "good cook", as well... Cue 2 hours with a tea towel wrapped round my thumb calling the doctor and even then I still have a scar to this day 😂   Keep those fingers (and thumbs) well away from blades!
I fucking LOVE green bean casserole!
hi
Marge be like 5:35
Sadly matzo ball soup doesn’t really work for gluten free :(
Me a 12 year old kid hmmmmmmmm cool
This truly is amazing!!!
I love your videos they are the literal best thing of my day
All of y’all saying she couldn’t beat Gordon Ramsay, don’t be an idiot sandwich 🙄✋
YES THEY ARE BACK
I like green bean casserole
Literally me on Valentine's Day I gave my boyfriend food poisoning trying to make chicken alfredo. The worst part was my stomach is so used to me shiting cooking I wasn't even sick must have an iron gut after all the crappy food I cook for myself over the years 😭😭😭😂😂😂
I lovr Motza ball soup!! Whenever we have it for Passover it’s my favorite thing next to the lamb!
3:00 uhh... is your foot okay?
Need me some “baking gloves”
5:52 I would go to Illy Mart just to purchase Uchiha Tears and Grace Field Meat. Only high quality products in my kitchen 😩👌
Green bean casserole is the best
Someone has been watching Jujutsu Kaisen!!
hi
I love all the attention to detail in the backgrounds lol
My 'matza ball soup' is macaroni cheese. It's a massive calorie dense cheesefest, but it's comfort food. 💚 (I don't think I've ever seen matza ball soup in the UK but seems tasty!)
papa j— wait no
'Yucky wucky' I found that funny!
Love the jujutsu reference
IM OBESSED WITH THAT APRON
The moments when you are cooking and feel officially like Gordan Ramzay
Omg I’m eating matzo balls rn and they are good.
SOUP IS THE BEST!!!!!
Illy: I'm not a good cook Me: *war flashbacks to the time I was too scared to stick my hands in the oven to take the brownies out*
(in the theme of adventure time) Injury time Call 911 I'm not having anymore fun Call your friends And call your loved ones The pain just won't end Injury time
AWWW MEGUMI ITADORI AND NOBARA IN THE BACK I LOVE THEM
I need my fingers to draw. This proves that i should never cook.
I am 10
Anyone can cook, but not just anyone can cook without becoming a meme.
I get so scared on turning on the stove!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
YO ILLYSAA WHAT UP I HAVE NEVER COOKED
This is waaay too relateable...  Especially the mistaking teaspoons for table spoons...
Hey illy I know u say ur not a good cook well do u know cooking comes from trial and error hense u got to take ur time with it and cooking is an art and I fell in love with it so I wish I could cook for u lol .
Cooking in scary...
There was one spot after she said “and I know how to use a knife” where she DROPS THE KNIFE ON THE FLOOR RIGHT AFTER. Just because it’s animated does NOT mean I didn’t almost jump out of my seat to save her foot.
I love cooking and eating a lot of the  ladder
Ilymation: Matzo ball soup  Me: oh hell yeah. I fucking love this
I also have cooking anxiety, I even watch when other people cook to make sure there won't be a fire, but I love  food so it's worth it
Saludos desde Latinoamérica :v
What time is it it's Ramen time Ramen time yah yah yah
I️ love matzo ball soup. It’s like a hug in a bowl.
Hash brown casserole is much better
you posting a video about matza ball soup literally 3 days before passover? *chef's kiss*
Omg I missed you 😭🤚
I made banana bread and broke the microwave from melting butter 🧈😬
I love you illymation
Nice video !!
Big recommendation for homecooks who are just starting out: Check out Helen Rennie and Adam Ragusea on youtube! Their recipes are good, but more importantly they teach methods and concepts and not just recipes Edit: Also don't get disheartened if you fail at first. Nobody is a good or even decent cook right from the start.
Aren't we goona talk abaut how Illy has my bf i mean shoto sticker in her fringe luky🤣
I just make box mac 'n' cheese and the bags of ramen (my family calls it oodles and noodles)
I too am afraid of my stove, but weirdly enough but just fire from the stove
I have a deathly fear of turning on the oven, always have to ask my younger siblings to do it for me :cc
O good glad I'm not the one who cut myself with a peeler
you are the bestttttttt pls upload moreeee
GREAT VIDEO IWWY AND TEAM!!!!
Electronics enthusiasts be like : Sharp objects you say?  We use searing  hot soldering irons, sharp thin needle like components  and  and  hot high voltage  arcs and wire cutters ; ) ?
7:07 "don't make the balls too big". Me: That's what she said.
4:37 I see you, with the references!
From a Culinary Student perspective, I approve this video!
The next Meggy Spletzer
I still don't know how to cook but it just seems scarier to buy the ingredients rather than actually cook them.
If any one will Say that what shes doing is a waste of time i will accidentally drown them
what about the MAC STICKS
This is just my 6th grade Home Ect class
Minecraft Taco
[Matzo Ball Soup] *[Bubbe has entered the chat]*
Ok that is literally just chicken and dumplings
I got luck that my girlfriend is a cook
As someone who plans to go into culinary the stuff I heard was very accurate and you did pretty good at explaining it.
Ayo She dropping bars
well i guess eating soup is a crime now
The art assets are so beautiful Illy!!
Illy you are the best and very good at everything you do even if you don’t think that. But stop calling me out I know I can’t cook 😭
The quality of her animations are mind blowing apart from her skills on storytelling
Hello
I actually had trouble chopping stuff because I never held my knife correctly so um thanks 😳
ah yes and the next step is joining masterchef
1:15 I did that once.  in short it hurt.
Yes yes I am
Why do I have a feeling that Illy has been binge-watching jujutsu kaisen.
lol
This is one of my fave videos that you've made!! Loved everything but I /died/ at Peppa Pig😆
Why is your fridge a homunculus
It was only bound to happen that Abnormal Chaos would help work on a video for the Queen of Chaos herself.
Sorry i still can't watch this fully since i need to sleep but ill makesure to watch this later
*Illy has returned*  Everyone liked that
I literally took a small chunk of skin out of my finger while peeling potatoes a few days ago lmao
Check how much salt you put in too
My knives are as sharp as my wit......... so yeah they pretty ✨dull✨
illy: I can't cook! me a 13 year old: i made dumplings last week, how do you not know how to cook? illy:  MAtZo BAll sOuP me: ohhhh so you can cook
l'm not a great at cooking stuff too illymation but l'm good at cooking some stuff i want to cook and my kitchen.
You can do all those yummy foods but I can't even make ramen. -I forgot to put water in it and caught my microwave on fire-
I really wanna try matzoh ball soup now, but I live in Ireland and I don’t know where to find it. Well , where there’s an illymation video there’s a way I guess hehehe :)
It's those stoves that turn on randomly... *THEY'RE EVIL!*
I love your channel 🤩🤩
My family is jewish and they make Matza Ball Soup a lot. Im trying it because of this video :)
6:19 I understood that reference
I hate peelers they've cut me too many times
illy: If you value the fingers you were born with learn how to use sharp objects correctly ( I’m probably not saying it correctly Word for Word but whatever you get the point ) me: but I like KNIFES 🥺🔪
Over the years I have cooked many a good meals, meatloaf, chicken Alfredo, Mexican, hamburgers, etc. but what I am really good at is Chocolate chip pancakes. That is my specialty.  You will found your zen in the kitchen. 😀❤️
The thumbnail looks so good!!!
．．．Im sorry but i really wish illy wouldve said this at some point in this video...           ✨Ｆａｗｋ　ｙｏｕｒ　ｃｈｉｃｋｅｎ　ｓｔｒｉｐｓ ✨
and we all know the golden rule of cooking you eat what you make unless its inedible
I'm like 13 and I know how to make an amazing Guacamole thanks to my grandma.
Illy: Are you old enough to turn on the stove without being scared but you’re still scared for some reason?  Me: Yeah...b-but I’m younger than-
*"im here for the chaos!!!!"*
Lol here is 1 am I should be sleeping
Perfect video Illy I have a same story to go with the peeler when I was at camp and was cooking for scouts lol
im gonna be honest when my mom doesn't feel like cooking dinner and wants one of us to do it the only thing i do  is make spaghetti lol
For the drumroll after she said "GreenBean Casserole!" and add came on right after and said "Experience matters!"
I love matzo ball soup! We're going to have it on Saturday for Pesach, and I can't wait
I'm sorry but the only thing I was focused on was Todoroki and Fullmetal alchemist 😂 ANIME ❤️
I cringed IMMEDIATELY when she grabbed the potato peeler. Too close to home.
IM EARLY FOR ONCE  ILSM
this video went. very well with my Very low effort throw-in-the-oven-and-wait-20-minutes dinner
😘😘😘👋🇸🇦
No one’s perfect at cooking. It’s hella difficult. But can be picked up relatively quickly. Then again, it’s hard to get good at.
I can’t cook but I kinda blame my parents since they never cooked lol
The best thing I can make is shake-n-bake pork with rice-o-roni
I've been making grilled cheese for a year now, and I still burn the bottom of the bread... but then I see the cheese ISN'T MELTED AT THE TOP YET, so I flip it over and the other side then gets burned! I mean, it still tastes good, but it's a bit too crunchy...
Eyyy I hurt my finger peeling a potato too yaaaayy
1:07, Illy having a fun time with soup. Also Illy has a good singing voice!
DON'T DIS GREEN BEANS!!!
every Friday, me and my brother alternate cooking something we've never had before. |Most of its good, some of it not but hopefully by the time we leave home we might be halfway decent at it.
"injury time...injury time"🤣🤣🤣🤣🙌that part got me
I love the peppa pig reference. I just love it.
“B A K I N G  G L O V E S” caught me so off guard lol. This was a great vid :3
I love the show Good Eats as a primer in giving one the ins-and-outs about how to and why to... I cooked a turkey like he recommended: used a liquid brine, turning it over every now and then, using a tinfoil hat, oils and robust seasoning... It was a smash hit! Oh, I'm sorry, it was a smash hit with everyone who tried it cause my mom ( raised in the Appalachian South) refused to even try it and even tried to talk my kids out of trying it cause "You are going to poison those kids by leaving that turkey in a bucket."  Me- Mom, didn't you ever brine a ham or chicken? Momma Aramakie98- Well, yes, but that's ham and this is a turkey Me- ...  So, if you really want to try to learn to cook experiment a bit and go outside of your comfort zone, even if it makes those around you uncomfortable, too.  Edit: spelling
the anime stickers on the fridge in the background make me way too happy
We all are trying Illy, we all are ✊
I bet this was intentionally posted in time for the high holidays in a few days
"Double triple check if it says tablespoon or teaspoon" The book: *says tablespoon* Me: *looks away and back* The book: *still says table spoon* Me: ok but are you sure? *looks away and back* The book: *still says tablespoon* Me: *puts in a tablespoon* The book: No you were supposed to put in a teaspoon you ideot!
Am I the only one who spotted TODOROKI? And 100000% OTHER ANIME CHARACTERS AHAHHAHAHA 👁👄👁
She was talking about what food to bring to her friends I thought she would bring chipolle
Double Illy!
Hi illy it's been a while
Okay but when you slice your spoon into the matzo ball and then also get broth it’s just...mwa
Matza ball soup slaps harder than my dad after a stressful day
I learned to make food when i was 9 I could cook eggs potatoes soup cake cookies and a lot more
I burned a waffel i put it in the microwave for 8 mins- I TOUGHT IT WAS 8 SECONDS DONT ASK
Too much pepper- I can relate.
At least you can say you put a little bit of your self in every meal 🥁🥁
same same same same  sHtOrY tImE:  when i make ramen all i do is stare at the water so nothing happens  a few years ago i tried baking a pop tart in the microwave. i thought the box said 3 minutes but it said um.. it said 3 seconds- well, 1.5 minutes in i smell something burnt and then i saw the microwave about to catch on fire. i turned it off, opened the microwave and a cloud of smoke hit my face. and i started sobbing (i was like 10 and i’m turning 14 so like don’t judge i’m an emotional baby) and the alarms went off, our alarm company called, and may i remind u that my mom, brother, and grandpa were there with me while my dad and other brother were getting stuff for my bday ... yeah so i don’t use the microwave anymore  another time was actually um...yesterday aha.. i was making things out of clay and it said 15-30 minutes but 2 minutes in everything was burning so my clay pieces were ruined and i don’t use the toaster oven anymore...  i had a dream where i was dancing in front of the oven and our house caught on fire.. i don’t use the oven anymore  so now i’m just left with the stove. help omg i can’t make pasta foreverrr  maybe i’ll try grilling :0 yeah no i take that back  u can go now, no more stories :)))
I love how she says ted talk instead of tiktok
Did any one else spot todoroki on the fridge and other anime stuff inthe back ground
I just got a grubhub ad......
I hate that I made the exact same measurement mistake, but Instead with like garlic or something
this is good vid. :)😁👌👍
The aprons look great!
I really watched this whole video, and I didn't realize that for half the video it was muted, smh at myself, good video tho
She’s back! Love your videos Illy ur a big inspiration to me!
At least you don't have worry cooking paleo-friendly foods for your husband, because he needs to lose another 30lbs for his job!!! Also, always call mom for cooking advice😉
Think of the children   -illymations 2021
everyone can cook if you try
Oh man im gonna have the little song in my head all week
Dear illymation, i just want to say, thank you. thank you for everything, like just being yourself. you have helped me through so many things, i cant name them all! so, really the only thing i can say is, thank you. thank you for being strong, thank you for  working through the hard times and everything. im sorry it sounds so cheesy and crap, but its the truth. so, thank you illymation.                                                 also, sorry im late
Y did it take me till 6:08 to see the todaroki magnet
Tbh the part where illy is harassing maaz about the ball's size sounds kinda inappropriate lmao
I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR AN ILLY VIDEO OMG I LIVE FOR THESEE
after so long of waiting she returned
Thank you, I would love to keep all my 8 fingers. This really helped
"Anyone can cook"  But that doesn't mean anyone can make cook right"
2:32 Oooooh, is that a Karasuno jacket I see?? 7:01 FULLMETAL ALCHEMIST HOMUNCULUS SYMBOL ON THE FRIDGE?!??!???! Oh and yeah there's a Pikachu there too ig. 7:42 There's also Todoroki, as well as...I think his name is Mob? Or is that just the name of the show? Anyways yeah there's Mob Psycho 100’s protagonist.
GREEN BEAN CASSEROLE IS FUCKING BOMB!!!!!!!!!!!
5:50 "Uchiha Tears"
LEGIT I wished illy would post tomorrow, I said that yesterday AND MEH DREAM CAME TRUEEE
Hi
Green bean casserole SLAPPED, people dunk on it but it's really good!
i was wating for you to post i knew you worked hard i love you soo much you are the best animator you deserve to be in a netflix film
I'm just scared when I'm frying food
Gosh I only know how to cook popcorn-
I started cooking when I was 8 my mom told me not to, now I am 15 and I cook food for myself when everyone has gone to sleep cuz I stay up till 4 am but my fam only knows that I cook at night not that I stay up all night.
4:35 so are we all gonna ignore the painting with Jujutsu Kaisen is the back?
I'm now hungry from watching this video
Its so surreal watching this after seeing all her insta posts
Gordon Ramsey is quaking at Illy’s mad skills.  🙏🏽😔
GOOD COOKER
I love food... I know, I know, everyone loves food... but I REALLY LOVE FOOD!
As someone who almost burnt down a whole house trying to make toast......I agree✋🏽😔
Imagine this you have a family gathering and your cousin is like the best at cooking and he comes over here and says maybe you can help him in the kitchen. You get left alone and two minutes later your asking for his help and the food is burnt. That’s me
I can cook ...            Meat but a special type of meat it’s human meat it tastes nice will some liver
I feel like “Kinda tastes like taxes” didn’t land
Maaz with a funko pop head is cursed content
"Huh that was a wierd feeling, kinda tastes like taxes" Me: "AKA probably tastes like depression"
Wait the sponsor, its comfy when its on the outside of your clothes? And its waterresistant but you can wash it?
love the ted talk:}
I cook dinner sometimes for my family so I have a good bit of experience and I love to bake.
0:38 don't go Luigi
Why is there allwyas a comment Saying  "Can you real my small comment" In a small font  Idk why but it's kn every video  And it gets alot if likes  You feel me
I like so much your animations and bring me a good time when I feel down, thank you and continue with your amaizing work💜
I want to share something my mom discovered for cooking. It's kinda like the matzo balls but it's homemade and INCREDIBLY easy to make.  1. Get some tofu 2. Literally just put it into the freezer 3. Take it out and boil it in the soup It's pretty much just a sponge.
Become the seasoning 😌
Still have no idea what a matzo ball is... Don't think I will find it here in Scandinavia. The first meal I remember cooking at my own dorm at the age of 16 was soup, and I put WAY too much pepper in there! Thankfully one of my roommates liked it so I gave it all to her
More interested in the fact that she drew the back of her head tbh 🚮
I was just wondering....... are u Jewish?
Lol im literly preping the paprikas for the chicken wraps my mums making later
i did follow on insta lmao
I love how Illy censors out curse words differently in every video - like how she used a sports whistle for the censor in her Varsity video, or how in this video she uses a microwave beep. It's the small details that sell!
I can barely cook
Why does Linguini the Human sound oddly... pathetic
Im 10 and i can make ukoy :D
YES finally an animator uploaded!!!! Odd1sout Jaidenanimations Itsalexclark haven’t uploaded in forever ty illymation!
Any advice for AFTER you chop your hand off? Let me know ASAP please..
Nice video, I did go vegan about half year ago and it was amazing decision but I am only 14 so it was big change, now I am cooking all my food by myself and I learned a lot. I am still making mistakes but am also geting better and better. And I am pretty happy that I started cooking in this age beacuse its quite important.
Honestly, I've NEVER heard of Matzo ball soup before this. Buuuuuut, they look very similar to a Mexican soup I grew up with called Albondigas. I wonder if they are the same thing just different cultural locale.
Yay! Another illymation video!! I love you and your videos and they always put me in the greatest mood, stay safe and amazing! <3      (Also- Is nobody gonna talk about how well the backgrounds are drawn? Like backgrounds are hard to draw vhjvbfcev-)
I’m 13 and I can cook lol
As a chef, I can relate to this so much. When I first started out I didn’t even know how to cut an onion 🧅. Now I show other people how to make pies and cakes and fettuccine Alfredo, etc. If you ever want to learn how to cook, bake or prepare the best salads you’ll ever eat. Lmk.  Also, now I am calling them baking gloves for now on. Lol.
How to cook...     How to not cut of all your fingers :)
Is it weird that I felt really zen when she was like: _become, the seasoning_
1:24 id rather have archotech fingers but sure 4:47 a real friend would have keeled over and played dead XDDDDDD
ermahgerd shes back
YouTube. I learned how to cook from my parents but recipes on yt and cook books.
Ight, cya next month ✌🏾
peppa, what are you doing in my soup?
I have to manually turn on the oven with a lighter and put my hand on fire now I have ptsd with ovens
1:05 isn't  that the ingredients to make the powerpuff girls
This is why I mostly make cupcakes cakes and pasta
4:55  my hero academia shoto magnet on the refrigerator I hope I was the first to catch this  6:08 Mob psycho 100 magnet also (i’m not sure of it and I haven’t watched the anime yet so don’t hate)btw also pikachu was there
It doesn’t matter the amount of taste in the food, it’s the love that’s put into it.
Omg can I get a shotout
i love that its gonna be passover in a week and a half and illy made a video about matzo ball soup
soup
I do pancakes and pretty well, too. I also like dinner kebabs
Not sure if anyone is going to read this, but: they have cut-proof gloves at ~$10(maybe it's a worthy purchase for me because I of a mandolin incident😅)
Just in time for my birthday! I literally didn’t know what I was going to have for my special dinner but I think I’m going to give it a try. Thanks!
1:02 that’s my mom every morning- she just randomly dances XD
Ah yes, Illy posting on my birthday...      *I have been chosen*
i expected this to be sponsdered by hello fresh
Me: sees cooking video  Also me: rushes to the comments desperately searching for the Iron Chef
no such thing as too much pepper lemme at it
LOL cooking is hard
Matzoh ball soup is awesome.  Yes I'm jewish, why do you ask?
Tanks so much this video means so much bc I'm not that good at cooking 😅
I grew up in the north and I frickin love me some green bean casserole  (We put cheese in ours tho)
I was taught to cook at a young age, I enjoy it very much
YESSS MOTZO BALL SOUP!
R.I.P Fingers
Woah I’m early that’s neat
I was trying to find the name of the soup in the video and even though you Illy the name a thousand times I just couldn't find it until 5 minutes later 😂
I just remember "beautiful?" and it's fuck how all depresed people are always happy Why are we happy?
Count the anime Easter eggs I counted 10 ✨
My husband was a chef in a professional kitchen and still managed to chop the tip of his finger off. Even those that can cook well can still get hurt too.
I love that you were sponsored by a small business <33
"Anyone can cook." Yes, but some people have bad taste.
You should try making mexican food
what if illy is a motza ball
Can u plz say hii smail plz I am a big fan!
YES NEW VIDEO BEEN DYING FOR A NEW VIDEOOOOOO
I love her so much she's so amazing ❤️❤️
:O I need to try that soup
Nobody: Me: Fries Schnitzel in chilli oil
I love watching people cook when I can’t cook lol
Another fine piece of art, good job illy!
Oh you should try my grandpas spaghetti he is master
F in chat everyone agrees if you are not an iron chef you arnt good enough to be a good chef.
5:03 LOOK AT THE FRIDGE MOB (From Mob Psycho 100) IS ON IT!!!!!!!!!
With all the ratatouille references: Did you watch the Musical?
6:53 Was that Jaiden???
Man It's Feels so Good to be back from this Channel. Your Videos are so Entertaining!
Bruh, I've only made one meal in my life, and it made my dog puke
No puns in da kitchen.
So cooking mama isn't a good teacher
honestly one big cooking tip I realized when I went to university: slow cookers are the bomb. they're so freakin convenient and you can make all sorts of things in them! soup, stew, pulled pork, roast beef, ribs, etc. just prep your ingredients in the morning, throw em in for 6-12 hours (depends on what you're cooking) and then enjoy it after work!
The fifteen dislikes are people who thought that was a frying pan
Your animation skills have improved so much!
Mazoball soup is the bomb, my mom would always making alot for Hanukah. Last year was my first time cooking them myself (cause y'know, the whole rona thing). Last year is also the year I learned that cooking is kinda hard
Thank you for the tip sensei
Now I really wanna try a matzo ball...or should I say Maaz-o ball
"Peppa what are you doing in my soup~?" 🤣🤣🤣 love that
Ehe same 0.0
Great video! I'm afraid of the stove still :<
cat illy can't hurt you she isn't real AHHHHH SHES REAL SHES REAL
Did anyone else notice the yuji, megumi and nobara picture in the background?Does that mean Illy watches jujutsu kaisen?
er 00:12
If you think you are a bad cook, just consider that you can't do worse than forgetting the sugar for SUGAR COOKIES like my cousin did once lol
Why would anyone subscribe and turn on notifications just to dislike great content?
Common cooking isn't that hard
I am Jewish so in tow days I whold have to it only mazzot and mazzo ball soup and stuff because passover
THINK OF THE CHILDREN
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOO

Wow not bad I will take
Izzzaitsasoup
2:30 ILLYS A FURRY CONFIRMED
Growing up hispanic I had to learn how to cook at a young age, now I'm 22 I'm scared of oil splashes when I cook 😅 I got 2nd degree burn 🤣
7:58 GIRL, WAS THAT A RATATOUILLE: THE MUSICAL REFERENCE?!
the remi was so cute!
Oh 😆remmy🥰the🤪ratatouille🥵the🤠rat🐀of😘all😙my😇dreams😍
Atleast it wasn't brussel sprout casserole.
Green bean casserole is the bomb it’s my favorite food
I love looking at the basics of recipes then experimenting with ingredients and seasonings. It usually ends up pretty good! You should try a stir fry dish, they're pretty easy.
i know how to hold a knife now immediately drops it
Is Luigi secretly on your head when your cooking
Damn I remember peeling my finger with a potato peeler, it hurts :(
Just in time for passover!
"What time is it?" Injury time.
I'm in virtual class ......................i'm really hungry now ;_;
I'm here I'm here
Matzo ball soup is amazing!!
Wait the rats name aint  Ratatouille wait wtf...ALL THIS TIME IM BEEN LIED TO!
I LOVE SOUP TIME
You'd be surprised how much you don't need pepper when you cook
Dinner is served.
pepppppaaaa whatt are youu doingg in myy soupp
Maazs reaction to green bean casserole: ''EW! Green beans and casserole?! Yucky!''  Me who has been eating green bean casserole my whole life: ''...''
Green bean casserole the best😩🥵
As a former pastry chef, don’t ever say you’re a bad cook. You’re trying , learning, and growing! 💜🖤💜
My motto is: Give up. No one cares about you trying.          HOW ENCOURAGING!!!
The funniest part is I rewatched ratatouille almost a week ago.
Well this took a long time But it was all worth it😂😂😂
im 11 and im ok at koocing
I'm not here for the animation, I AM HERE FOR LILY SINGING A CRINGY SONG ABOUT SOUP
Here for the CHAOS is an understatement 🤣😈
It’s been a while but the wait was worth it
THE PEPPA PIG MEME
2 words  Jujutsu Kaisen
RATATOUILLE
I still get a little surprised from the stove LMAO
Wait people think green bean casserole is gross?
Mom: eli turn on the stove... Me: oki -turns on-  *satan comes out of the lighter* A-
Peppa what are you doing in my soup?
Im actually surprised how long it took me to realize the Ratatouille reference in the thumbnail
Literally every food you mentioned in this video, I love beyond belief
Not gonna lie the best part of this video was the apron
Eating at 3AM to the next level
Hii I'm a big fan
Nice
3:02, literally drops knife on foot 😂
I like your videos
im i bit early
i hurt my fingies :(
Well I’m gonna be home for a week... guess I’m making matzo ball soup 😅
Im not a dishwasher >:(  So dont make me wash dishes.
I loved the lil shoto magnet on the fridge
ill always remember this video, it was published the day before my birthday-
EEEK
Ngl I think the most gourmet thing I've ever made is minute rice
Did nobody notice the magnets on the fridge
Finally Another video, one of the best youtubers 👍
switch to an induction stove much easier to clean and less of a fire hazard.
I miss you illy !!!  (I've been subscribed to her from my old yt acc and now here, I love her)
I love your videos
All I can cook is toast
2:28 Yep, she’s a furry.
Since I live with both parents that know how to cook I have the luxury of being fat. I really want to learn how to cook both styles of food since my mom focuses on our culture food while my dad is more American. One of my favorite dishes of my mom is meatballs with egg and rice inside the middle and put into a simmering sauce that is both spicy and sweet. Then you make rice so you could put that delicious sauce on top of the rice so you have both of best worlds. From my dad has to be his lobster sauce spaghetti with breaded chicken which is amazing and one that I desperately want to learn
Hay girl
I just saw the picture for the video and I was already laughing and saying ratatouille! Love your art!
5:52 Uchiha tears. Nice one.
No Puns in the kitchen..... I'm gonna *kitch*-out before I get hurt... Uh Oh...
( this is not a hate comment) shut up XD XD XD the Peppe what are you doing with the soup that was so funny I love your channel
Funny aprons? Custom aprons? Finally, something my dad doesn't have yet and might actually use :v
every time I see one of your videos I yell "I AM HERE FOR THE CHAOS" for no apparent reason,and I love your videos!!!
You forgot to give Maaz a shoutout lol
Thanks for the recipe Illy!
YAYYYY illy’s backk!!!
Anyone can cook but only the fearless can be brave
I did the exact same thing to my finger when I peeled an apple when I was litte, still have a scar from it lol
**Steals todoroki magnet**      Also I can't believe she didn't say holy moly Christmas glory in this whole video
She Made a Pepa joke in 2021! *Mission passed* +Respect
I'm terrified of touching an oven- My mom: Baya can you wipe off the oven! Me: The light is on- so its h o t  Mom: No its not *she just starts  wiping the oven off* My brain like: i t w a s p r o b a b l y h o t t e r t h a n t o d o r o k i
Oh gosh I’m kinda early uhhh uhhhh if your watching this may you have a wonderful year!! 🍄
ThInK oF tHe ChIlDeN
OMG!! THE QUEEN IS BACK!!! AND BETTER THAN EVER!!! Great Video Illy!!! :D <3
She’s so pretty and funny. I love her vibe. Honestly
Love the videos
“ ~
I’ve been cooking pizza so much because that’s the only thing I know how to make with my bare hands in the kitchen that the only thing that I make
I make homemade chicken noodle soup. Hardest part, making some box noodle... or possibly chopping the chicken and veggies.
Thank you 😊 I will take your advice and hopefully keep all my fingers
Illy upload woooo
Glad my high school career area is culinary and I’m learning knife skills
No I want makos balls
I'm jewish so I understand the love for matzo ball soup
6:00 am I a lady or am I a rat (Am i a rat) meme right here 😂
1:02 my new favorite song
Am I the only 10 year old that can cook by myself?
Honestly, best tips I can give for anyone who's learning to cook: find recipes, follow the instructions, don't try to 'wing it' till you get a good grip on cooking. I started out with a discount on hello fresh boxes, I don't know if they still do this but I got to see the difficulty as I picked what they were going to deliver and worked my way up.  >knifes!? Cut away from your hands! Peelers?! Move away from your hands! Anything sharp? Move away from your haaaaaandssssssss  >If you frequently burn things in the oven, start checking on it every 10 minutes after half of the indicated time has passed. _Always_ double check the temperature.  >If you frequently burn things in the pan: sometimes food is a prick. You're watching the pasta water not do anything, walk away to grab something and boom- it boils over. Nasty stuff, you can only counter that by sticking around. If it's too boring, maybe listen to some music. That way you can still keep your eyes on the food.
Haha todoroki on fridge
Green bean casserole is great.
Reminded me that I need to do my taxes. Thanks!
illy, stop cooking with chemical x, you won't become the powerpuff girls 2:07
One of the reasons i like you, is that like watching you, is because you are relatable, more relatable than most youtubers.
wow I'm early
I 10-feet social distance from stoves and knifes soooo.
Nobody's perfect in kitchen even Gordon Ramsay has burnt bread. Good on you girl for going into the kitchen.
no, im not a young inspiring professional i wish i was...
Ratatouillie Animated version
I love the storyboarding you did for this video! So much variety and style!
Hope your finger is well
Shoto magnet on the fridge      Nice
0:29 no that’s just your dogs homework
No, i want to eat my fingers ! Also i love cooking with my parents and learn new meals.
green bean casserole needs to be a think everywhere. it’s the bees knees even in northeast america
I burned my hand when I was cooking food
It’s always nice when she posts 😌
As a culinary student I approve this message! 😊
I don't know why but I found it hilarious when she said "now I know how to hold a knife" then immediately drops it on her feet or floor.
i only know how to make ceral
"Might lose a finger..." That's why she animates just four fingers!!
Does anyone else still get scared when the toast comes out of the toaster...  no only me
I suggest if you like pasta, tomato and tuna to mix some tuna in with your tomato sauce for a nice change to the regular
Oh, try cooking lentil soup it’s really good and I thinks it’s pretty easy!
Illy is the chef's from little nightmares except not ugly
Wow u have a lot of likes and only 9 unlike 🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
Lesson of the sponsor: don't mess with illy
wait illy this is amazing! its fine to take a break, we dont mind at all :DD
I can regenerate my limbs so i don't care
YAY! i love seeing new videos 😍
this is cool since Passover is coming up soon
I am old enough to use the stove, but I don’t wanna burn to a crisp while using it, so I’ll just make the easy food, or order food ;-;
Hey I have a similar kitchen nightmare to you cutting yourself with your peeler. When I was like 10 I was helping my mom peel potatoes and I didnt know what I was doing. And I peeled my own thumb nail off. And yes it was as painful as it sounds.
I made this resapie during quarinteen its SUPER simple all You need is...  1apple like 6 marshmallows and (if You Can have it) penutbutter put a Layer of Apples in a Bowl then the marshmallows and then the penutbutter if You want You Can add honey or cinaminn. Hope You like it 😅im 11 btw
4:36 Jujutsu Kaisen Painting cool
I'm going to put cheese in my soup. Also frito pie is the Texas staple very simple chill fritos, shredded cheese, and wolf brand chili. Only wolf brand chili trust me.
“Peppa! What are you doing in my soup?”    *-Illy 2021*
Okay this girl is on fireee Gud at art and cooking (kinda there)  ...... Luv you illy! You are trully inspiring
ITS SOUP TIME. ITS SOUP TIME. GATHER ALL YOUR FRIENDS ITS SOUP TIME. ITS SOUP TIME. ITS SOUP TIME. THE ONLY CURE FOR SADNESS.
I forgot you existed because you haven’t been uploading
"Peppa what are you doing in my soup?" R i p
Honestly, I can cook.     OH FUDGE SICKLES. I FORGOT I'M COOKING SAUSAGE!
i honestly cant cook either XD
Question for Illy, have you ever watched Gravity Falls? If not, please do. You won’t regret
i knew i wasnt the only who gets scared when they turn on the stove
U forgot MACSTICKS (from public school food)
this video made me really happy halfway through a tough month of school!
1,019 commet
*SHE PROTEC* *SHE ATTAC*  but most importantly *SHE IS BAC*
MORE OF THIS! PLEASEEEEEEEEEEEE
Why did that soup time song remind me if regular show?
We eat green bean casserole every thanksgiving
I too am from North Carolina
I need a 1 hour loop of Motza Ball Soup Meditation
Its a nice story and a lot of rhymes
k um i'm 9 and i now how to cook already i have to help my mom everydayy!!!!!!
Well at least bain told us how to cook meth.
I was in the kitchen and i was making my mom some coffee and I went to pour it into the cup and then the glass on the coffee pot broke and my hand burned and I broke our coffee pot.....ouch
Earliest ive ever been  I love cooking- so this is gonna be great.
For the love of god tuck in your fingers, I didn't once while cutting an onions. Long story short,  I had to go to the emergency room and get five stitches, This happened in Nov. and I still don't have all the feeling back in my thumb.
im ceying lmao, i have a curse practically, every time i use the stove i always burn myself, but my mum hasnt ONCE and she practically taps it every 3 minutes i-
My oldest brother used to have a stove and oven like that with gas and fire and using it was terrifying! I was so afraid I'd accidentally forgot the gas on, while looking after his dog for a week and that everything would burts into flames when I'd try to put the stove on again lmao. I like "normal" stoves more, the electrical ones(?). No worries about the gas with those.  I have never tasted matzo ball soup, need to look those up and also start cooking more. I eat too much microwave food, even though I love love love cooking myself and friends have said I'm a good cook. I'm just a biiiiit lazy...... Need to start cooking more and maybe try some new recipes.
This video is so fricking funny! great work, also I liked the tiny Todoroki on the refrigerator.
i felt the tbsp turning into the tsp in my soul💀🤌🏾
I love cooking, I kinda had to learn from early on on my life due to  my dad working to much and my mom gotten sick, and f my older brothers who weren't kind enough to cook for me or buy me food too (you jerks >:( ) But I love it, I started doing eggs, and quesadillas, now I can even make lasagna :D
I started to cook when I was 3 and I'm still not great at it. Also green bean casserole us the bomb
I've found precooked bags of chicken near the deli of my store & they're a Godsend! I use them with chicken & rice soup with a can & 1/2 of water, a shot of hot sauce (Might be too much for normal people) & throw some cheese on top. They have different flavors too like rotisserie, fajita, grilled, roasted, all of which can give different flavors. I also like using the family sized bags for curry, don't need to spend all day prepping. I use plain diced frozen breakfast potatoes & frozen cut carrots, just boil em & toss em in the roux while it's dissolving in water along with the chicken & prep some rice. Usually only takes about half an hour.
OMG SO EARLY
Oh another video of you trying so hard to be relatable and trendy by shoving dozens of anime references.
Today I pushed the sub button but the when I pressed it (New Video) 😂 lol
I have only read the title so far and, as a 16 year old who cooks weekly, I can already relate.
True story one time when I was making french fries I chopped a chunk of finger skin off it hurt like heck
Omg Todoroki on the fridge  girl in ur vids u have so many mha teasers
I could study, buuuuuuuut I need to watch this instead!
My mom has had the same apron for YEARS time to tell her about this-
RAT-tso ball soup? Sounds good.
She said papa John then the next ad i get is papa john
You should make some Mac Sticks for nostalgia 🤣
YES, SOMEONE ELSE WHO LIKES MOB!
Bruh I once gave myself food poisoning by trying to substitute eggs with custard in a cake. I was sick for a week, throwing up and that kind of shit. Because of a stupid cake. To this day, I still gag every time I smell anything similar to that...
Yes 😁 how do i do this
Amazing video. Keep up the good work
soup time ingerey time
3:36 Jeffy has left the chat

"You cannot live off of Chipotle!"- Illymation, 2021  Best life skill advice of the year! Take that, people who eat fast food everyday!
First time I'm watching ur vids and they're so good!!!!
Once I added 1/4 a cup of vanilla extract to cake on accident and me and my brother were having a competition and he wont let me forget about it.
Nice video :) smiles for all
Green bean casserole is my favorite dish, my mother makes it every year for Thanksgiving.
The best food I can cook is an egg.......
Want to know how bad I'm at cooking? I tried to fry an egg and Gordon Ramsay teleported to my house just to shout at me that the egg was still raw.
I cooked a food one... it was ok
Soup time is my faifret time
im the 17, 634th viewer :D
I might be 14 but i wanna learn how to cook to :)
I,m just happy for another vid
Cool video
Dang it! Late!!
LOL! one glimpse at the thumbnail and title and I was like SAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAME!
im jewish and its almost pesach the holiday when we eat matzah ball soup
i think everyone would agree on this with me when i say,  its better if none of us cook
Illy: so how many easter eggs do you want to put in your 2020/21 videos     Illy: yes
i watched some of your older videos, and i realise, that you are so much more confident. and also, the new mic, muahh! nice.
I add a teaspoon of chicken bullion, garlic and onion powder to green bean casserole, it tastes really good!    Ps. The Frenches chicken recipe on the back of the frenches onion container is also bomb. Com lol. Instead of an egg use Mayo though. It's amazing.
As someone who grew up in the south and highly allergic to green beans it’s been awkward.
I love cooking!!! Hopefully you get better at it fast food is expensive 😆
Cooking wite Alisa Ono it's on faier
3:28 Great now I’m gonna be thinking about how Illy drew a butthole on a plane for the rest of my life
Funfact:I am still scared of opening stoves.
7:12 you say think of the children but you swore like 2 seconds before that
at 6:15 i was traumatized...
aka every my day
Illy: it is the bees knees  Green bean casserole: I don’t wanna be the bees knees I just wanna be a normal casserole with normal knees
I used to suck at baking. One time I set a oven on fire when baking a cake from a mix. Now I can make homemade cupcakes
I love how illy is encouraging us to cook while I literally tried to warm a pizza in a pan and burned it
After Papa Johns tried outpizza-ing the Hut, we don’t talk about them anymore.
I don’t know how to cook I just order food 😭
Yoda, was Right. Girls born after 96 can’t cook...
thank you guys so much for your patience and support<3 i took a much-needed break during the month of february since i didnt break for the holidays! with that break i was able to whip up this BEEFY video. additionally-- i hope you don't mind the uptick in sponsors. I make sure to do business with those who deserve it-- and FunnyAprons truly deserves it! I'm able to speak with Mert and Lillie directly, (they're really nice!!) and again they're a small business based in Australia-- and I'm their first "influencer" to help spread the word about their legit awesome stuff. No weird middle men getting in the way and watering down products into lame cash grabs. Small businesses work so much harder, so... they just do it better, yknow? So thanks for hearing me out on that, and remember to support small businesses, especially during these stressful times <3
Love your animation 🌱🌸🦋❤️
It's ironic that it's my 19th birthday and the beginning got me 🤣
no flex but I am like 11 and love cooking.
TDYSDICLZGX HMN
Wow, I didn't know Chaos wrote a book, nevertheless a cooking book *inserts shocked pikachu meme*
The vid is just what I do for baking, I throw whatever together, bake it, and decide if it's good or not, the only difference is my matzo ball soup is pancakes. Also, Illy, not naming any names, but if someone's scared of the boiling water, how do they make the soup? help
Anyone can cook sure ......
COOKING IS A MONSTER AND AND COOK BOOK IS DEVILS WORK ON ITS OWN!
Did you know piggy was trending number 1 on gaming
illy wont heart, or comment or even pin :)

We’re one in the same then.

Matzo Ball Soup? WE NEED THIS ON BINGING WITH BABISH!
Cooking for yourself is the best especially you don't have to worry about what other people. I like putting chili peppers on my burger patty, I can't do that because my mom doesn't like it spicy
Gotta try that Matzo Ball soup!  The difficult part would be finding the ingredients...
Mixing up tablespoon and teaspoon I always did making pudding! I thought I was the only one TwT
Nice references to Ratatouille! Definitely one of my favorite movies of all-time!
Hehe balls.
Theres this really easy recipe called "pasta aglio e olio" and its so simple yet every time i make it I feel like GORDON RAMSAY.
As chef gusteau said anyone can cook       And so can you :)
Music wow!
It's funny to listen to you when I'm finishing school ( almost food technology technician and confectioner here XDD)
You’re one of my favourite my Youtubers!
3:02 girl, did you just drop a frickin knife on your toes?
i only know how to cook pasta and i make it GOOD
I was literally doing a marathon of your videos just yesterday
Ok
Sooooo I can make cookies and cream flavored matzo ball soup......
Last night I tried making american chop Suyi and it came out decent  And by I tried making it I mean my mom did most of the important work lol
Your videos are the highlights of my day
I cook at home a lot, and I tried to make many new dishes I've seen on TV. They turn out good, and some I miss completely because of seasoning.
I don't know if this was intentional but this video is literally just in time for passover!! (where the matzoball soup thing comes from)
Hi
14k views and it was only posted 14 minutes ago-    Btw you are my favorite YouTuber!!
Me sees Illymation uploads: YEAH BOI!!!!!
Me to, me to
I'm sure my dad would still like the peppery casserole
LOVE UUUUUUUUUU KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK IM NOT GONNA STOP YELLING!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Green bean casserole is the best, My family always makes it on thanksgiving (I live in the south too)
I *still* hate to turn on the stove, ever since I was like 5 I thought I was gonna burn myself or burn the house down 😂
Oml i need that apron
I think I'm more scared them my fingers.🥲
Matzo ball soup my granny makes that yummy
🤩
Illy definitely has my favorite animation style!
wooo
I remember my boarding kindergarten serving matzo ball soup a lot and we would drink that like it was water
Wooooow!!!!
love u illy.
ILLY YOU SHOULD MAKE A FROG CAKE- THAT WOULD BE A GOOD VIDEO-
What do taxes take like 👍
greenbean cassara is like drowning in the hevean of gordon ramse
Hi
Don't worry I almost cut my hand 3 times when slicing carrots
HOLY SHIT A NEW VIDEO THIS IS A GREAT VIDEO
Beeing near Pesaj, one of the food I'm looking forward to is matza ball soup. It is the f*ckin best! Also the fish and the meat BUT THE MATZA BALL OMG!
The best thing I can cook is fire
Girl green bean casserole is so freaking goodddd

Omg same illyy
This is why I bake rather than cook🍪
Yes! She returned, waiting for this video was worth it
I once bought a pound of chocolate. I needed to cut a piece so I got the big knife... And later needed stiches.
Yummy Taxes 😋
I AM SPEED
Finally I’ve been waiting patiently😌
I just made ramen noodles. Soooo YES!
Illy’s cooking skills in a nutshell: “What can I do? I’m just a figment of your imagination?”
By the way I can definitely see the quality of your videos get more and more better!
3:56 You forgot to add the bee antennas but who cares anyway.
I got electrified when I tried to turn the stove on and so, I never tried again.
Remi huh have u seen the game theory video
I can only make spaghetti and omelettes and my omelettes are still kinda wack when Im making double for my mom I always mess up on the second one so I take the second one and my mom gets the better looking and taste
I am 13. I was boiling some water to make coffee for my dad 2 days ago, and while waiting for it, I was staring right at it, And then it exploded! My face was boiling, my mom washed it with water and then put some burn cream on my face, and then my dad started fanning me with a piece of cardboard. My face is fine now(sort of). Despite me looking straight into it my eyes and eyelids did not get affected.  Be careful when using a stove.
I would eat your food, Illy.    And sell it for 46k dollars on the dark web   im kidding tasty food im hungry
I literally can't FRY anything, I'm so scared of tiny drops of oil just suddenly splashing on my skin
Ms. Illy, I have a question. Do you know how to make Macaroni and Cheese? That stuff is good.
OMG another great video!! Can't wait for the next video ☺️🖤
Wait. Two minutes ago! What?!  I am also testing recipes, I just always feel hesitant bc I don't wanna waste food on mess ups
also- is the matzo ball soup gluten/dairy/soy free? i do want to eventually try it.
Yes.
I love your videos your so funny
So like....anything?....like freezie pops?
We need  Joshua Wiessman to check this out!
I once made crêpes. It looked like human skin and tasted so bland.
Hey Illy, the other day I was playing Animal crossing pocket camp and I got Biscuit, and he came to my campsite and I see why you love him.
ok------
Peppa..? What are you doing in my soup?
In the kitchen your supposed to use a blue plaster to show where the injury is.
Hi
I just eye ball it with the seasoning
I can turn on a stove, the problem I have is putting things in the oven. You literally gotta slide your hand in and out as precise as possible or you’re gonna get yourself burned.
I can make: Quesadillas, Sandwiches, Fry an egg, make pasta, hotdogs, and toast. That's all. 🌚🔫
I usually forget to eat yet I still gain weight for   B R E A T H I N G
cooking is difficult  and remember "Never give up" Keep trying. Be safe with cooking utensils and don't goof up on cooking
I cant even crack an egg without getting scared of it spilling-
“Are you a young aspiring professional ready to take on the world?”  *nope. still need to wait 30 more years*
Sponsor: do you like this  Illymations: the law requires I awnser yes
Mozeballa sounds like Tofu?:3

I WANT ILLY TO WRITE A COOK BOOK
Sounds yummy you should try chicken breast with pasta and boiled carrots it’s a simple recipe you can make the chicken on the stove or anyway you want it’s up to you illy love ya illy-
Even just the animation of the soup looks good
“No Puns in the kitchen” the number of egg puns I’ve made must make me a war criminal
Seeing Illysa hold peppa pig with 4 eyes are f*cking cursed man.....  Wow, my first cuss word in this channel.
Everything I can say is     *Yes*
timely matzo ball soup reference for passover omg
The only thing I can cook is egg... Just a singular egg
Cooking Is One Of My Passions and I'm Grateful That My Parents Taught Me How To Cook. 😋🍽
Im from Israel and its peach so im waiting for some good old maza balls or קניידלך
OMG I love Matzo ball soup🍲🍲 I never thought it was a real recepi when I was a kid. I thought my mother invented it😅

I love how Illy's apron has just fire all over.
Sapnap apron?
4:15 ITADORI  Edit: 4:38 THE WHOLE GANG
The pepper story reminds me of my school it’s like they dropped 10 pepper things in one persons soup or any send
Bro, if you cant cook the best thing you can get is a croc pot.
After this video im afraid for my fingers
Lol love u illy
Me watching Illy tell us the recipe for the soup, what kind of onions? Yellow? White? Red? What kind of potatoes? Russet? White? Yellow? Fingerlings? Red? Or do we just use any kind of onions and potatoes we want?
This past year due to being jobless I started cooking more I watched a lot of gorden Ramseys basic cooking tips and it was really helpful cause now I can make the best potato in my house
Maaz is right. Green been casserole is disgusting...  *because there is no mayonnaise topped on it.* :(
QUEEN BACK
Ily ily!!
im here for the chaos
I am defiantly not freaking out at the fact that she drew Shoto todoroki, my comfort character, on her fridge!
Hearing illy yelling about the size of the mozza ball size is making my day
Kj
I studied cooking in school and I still don't know how to cook certain things 😂
You could do all this cooking, or you could just have a burger from McDonald's.
Me a 13 year old with the ability to cook for myself easily and baking a cake without a present recipe and knowkng how to turn on the stove since i was 9   *Oh no*
So, i like to consider myself a decent enough cook, and i have been doing it for about 10 years but until today i have never learned how you were properly supposed to hold a knife and the food while cutting it. I'm honestly surprised i've never cut myself before tbh..
hehe balls
Remi would be proud.
I cant cook at all :/
me when i heard her say matza balls:🤨 me when i searched matza balls in google: 🤩🤩🤩 Kneidlech!
Who else is hungry after watching this?
Me: anyone can cook *looks at rare chiken* But it doesen't mean everyone SHOULD cook
The only thing i can make is popcorn
Anyone seen gracefield meat?? 👀
2K likes  *and posted 11 minutes ago*   Ive never been early
I was in the cooking class so i see how you feel
Illy is the best❤❤
✨S O U P  T I M E✨ the most possibly dangerous time!
Illy "I'm not a good cook"  Meanwhile I'm lucky to figure out a PB&J sandwitch
Welcome back ily!!
Me one meter near a peeler: AAAAAAAHHHHHH!!!!!  My brain when I am with a knife: *turns into yuri*  Me: Yes knives are the best.  Also me: time to go to therapy.
I’ve never been a good cook xD  Once I tried making a cake for my mum and let’s just say- I didn’t use a recipe. so it only had 4-5 eggs and milk, not only this but at the time I didn’t understand how to cut baking paper out of the box- so it had massive and small holes in the paper, after I made it the eggs and milk went into the baking paper making it have baking paper cook threw it’s self- afterwards when it was finished and baked it looked like a massive burnt omelet filled with baking paper 😅On the same day I made ice blocks but with milk, water, cut up veggies that aren’t supposed to be in a ice block and much more not normal things in it, it didn’t end up freezing and was just a massive 7 cups with goopy and odd liquid in it-
Only 9 minuts. But... so meny koments
The only thing I can cook is boiled eggs, scrambled eggs, and fried eggs  *I’m allergic to eggs*
Love your videos this is the earliest I have ever been!
I can cook some things, buuuuutt. My husband is a way better cook. XD
This is great! Another rule: never cook drunk because you WILL get hurt... I know that from experience..
Love your content keep up the great work
I’m sorry Peppa.. RIP. ☠️ ⚰️
Green bean casserole SLAPS and I can’t believe that there are people that don’t like it
Wow, yeserday i had a feeling that your gonna post soon and today you posted, i'm so happy😁
I sure you’ll become a really good cook, if you keep practicing.
It has become a trend it seems like that young woman can't cook idk
EARLY
Illy I live in the south and no - green beans are good,casserole is good - BUT CHA DON'T PUT THAT SHIT TOGETHER... I'm still gonna try it but if I get food poisoning we gotta do a cross over on your channel because I can't make videos for SHIT
This is the best cooking tutorial i’ve ever seen
I got an ad for papa Jhon when she said add any thing papa jhons
Mha boi on fridge
🤺
" And you remember what i said about those fingers "  Yes ma'am i want my fingers intact
_“That’s a weird filling... tastes like tAxEs”_  *No no, Illy, it tastes like pAIN*
**trying to think of a good thing to comment while I'm early**
OMG I LOVE matzo ball soup!!!  I also really like green bean casserole
“Anyone can cook”  Me and my brother over here trying to cook potatoes, but burning them instead.
The intro sounds like some type of commercial ad lol
Illy using a birthday cake as a metaphor on my birthday hits me with tons of good vibes
I literally said out loud “She did it!” when she said “thank you for coming to my TED talk” 🤣
Peppa pig has to be the best anime hands down
I’m 14 and don’t know how to turn on the stove and the oven. At least I can cut blocks of cheese with a knife(though only like the amateur I am)!  Thankfully I have not yet tasted tax flavored filling in my birthday cakes, though the prospect of such things scares me to the bone about my future. _CRISIS TIME!_
2:29 she is a furry now
10 minutes 582 comments I give up
Peppa what are you doing in my soup- illymation

Thats what she said
6:16 Potato.  No    Meat.

Hey Illy if you need advice on how to get better at cooking then play overcooked 2 or maybe just play cooking mama 5: Bon Appétit 😉.
Chipotle is so expensive  More like ramen

Pshhh who needs to learn to cook, I am a proud broke human that lives of noodles and look at how great my life is. Wait
I'm 20 and still afraid of using the steak knives.  I think its because my Mom is a serious clutz and sliced herself lots...
