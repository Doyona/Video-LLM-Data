How come no video on the decking underside. Seen the decking video and nothing on the underside. Is it caulked and payed then painted or.....
I always wondered how you were making out. It’s great to see you again.
Such  incredible work
She looks fantastic.
It would be awesome if you have any original Tally Ho planking that could be planed and cut into small pieces and stamped with the Sampson Boat Co emblem. I would definitely buy one!!!!
I hope everyone is soaking up as much of Richard’s knowledge as they can The man knows a thing or two.
sorry to see Rowan gone, I enjoyed watching him branch out and learn/hone his skills.
What the name of that orange stuff which is put between timbers to keep water out?
My friend uses a metal detector to find all the metal works cheap tool too
Measure seven times cut four or five I always say
Those teak cover boards are going to look beautiful when they weather into that gorgeous shade of ashe-gray.
Playing catch up on videos and it was nice to see you actually getting to do some work. I'm sure that you do plenty but but recently the videos make it seem like you have taken more of a managerial and getting away from hands-on stuff from the early videos.
These guys put most joiners to shame. I’m amazed at their age how skilled they are. All so humble as well. As a bog standard carpenter it’s very inspiring.
Still loving the environmental photography you include in your edit these past few years. Really nice film making Leo. With all these shipwrights, you're bound to get this done, eventually :0
This is such a wonderful series for all boat lovers
is their a relationship btw this boat and Kirstn Neushafer's Minnihaha(based on Tally Ho Major)?
Such superb craftsmanship with all the covering boards and of course all the other parts as well, with all your precision fitting this surely is engineering in wood, congratulations to the whole Team, cheers from the UK.
hi can we have some pictures of Zeal on his trip to Alaska pllllleeeeeeeaaaassssssseeeeeee
Just think of the hours behind the scenes. Jut keeping the tools clean and sharp would take a lot of time. Not to mention set up and clean up.
Total Richard flex…”went a couple years without using a tape measure”. So true!  FNG = can’t read a tape Skilled = can read and use a tape well. Master Craftsman = does not need a tape and is perfect every time.
Pete's the pro
Commments
Cover boards, pro level
Well done lads. Z A most difficult box to check, cover boards bull nosed.
My favorite line...."I went a couple years without a tape measure".  That is what impresses me about wooden boat building.
Leo and Team, There are only so many ways to express the quality and artistry that goes into the restoration, selection of music and the skillful filming and editing of the videos and all those accolades are well deserved.  Let me echo all the plaudits you have all received but let me add one thing more. Leo, you make all of us feel good and when there is much to feel bad about in this world you manage to show us the best of life. You and your team are unique. Jim
I watch these videos and think. I understand pretty well what they are doing. I have pretty much all the tools I need to do it. I would fuck up so many times if I tried to do it myself. The level of skill is off the scale.
This deck looks just great! All of you did such a perfect job! Thx U ❤❤❤
Desde Pamplona (Spain) te he seguido durante todo el proceso, baya carpinteros súper buenos que tienes, unas máquinas 👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌
Hiya Leo
What a real pleasure and education to witness these very talented guys at work 👏👍😀
If anyone is wondering what Teak coverboards cost- hope you are sitting down- it’s well over $50 a board foot wholesale.  Transom boards are even worse- from $80 to $100 per board foot.  It is the only real choice for this maritime application … but the price tag is tough to swallow.
How to put a square peg in a round hole.
Hola que maderas utilizan para este proyecto ? Aprovecho para felicitar por el contenido de estos videos ,me entretienen muchísimo desde Argentina muchas gracias
I thought cutting the door profile in my laminate flooring was a challenge 🤣. OMG cover boards!!
When the craftsman smiles regardless of the price paid you have quality
12:10 Love that little smile on Pete's face. Beautiful work.
The scarfs on the covering boards are backwards! The outboard tail of the scarf should be pointing AFT!
Richard’s vacation is just working on different jobs 🤩
10:20 Ceiling Planks or Sealing Planks?
What was the plane that Pete was using to get into the corners of the nibs called. It was very cool
Very nice
The yellow cedar and teak look fantastic together.... great choice of decking material
Wondering what species wood are the planks from the original hull?
Good work keep it up
Leo has built an incredibly close-knit team that seem to work together so well. They serve as a fine example to us all - together we can achieve so much!
Beauty incarnate.
I like to think that at 22:15 everyone just randomly appeared to randomly sniff that nice plank :D
Leo, it is hard to fathom the amount of work that you have put into Tally Ho in a lot of cases you have to individually cut and prepare each and every bit of wood in weird shapes for each task/project on board. It makes you wonder how many hours it took to build the sailing ships of yesteryear In Western Australia we built the Replica of the Captain James Cook's Endeavour back around 1993,  but they had a huge volunteer task force helping  What you are doing with a few people compared makes it even more impressive,  I wonder how many kms of rope you will need for the rigging🤔 HUGELY impressed Leo  Tony from Western Australia 🇦🇺
Tradesmen transcending to Artisans. Impressive work guys. 😎🦘👌
What a craftmanship! Wow
I found your channel by accident two weeks ago and then spent these two weeks binging your channel and what an incredible journey to watch!! Whenever I do a boat project involving carpentry, now there is a definite "what would Leo do?" pause.
Any reason you are not filling the spaces between the hull and inner walls with expanding foam?
Wood doesn't grow on trees!  When does the hilarity stop?  LOL!!!
dot all your lower case j's......very funny in a serious way!
The craftsmanship continues to amaze me!
20:12 AHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!! USE A MALLET!!!!
Can’t believe it’s been 5 years since the first Tally Ho vid! I haven’t missed a single one!
Great work with the deck and cover board 👏👏👏
I have been watching for what feels like a very long time and have remained fascinated by all that your team do. True craftspeople. I have understood the scope of the project however the size of the cover boards and the process has just really bought it home how truly large this process is. Great episode. Thank you Leo & team.
Cold and rainy.....lovely weather for sailing
Nothing happening.
Leo, any idea what the original boat weighed?  Any idea what this one will weigh?  Judging by the amount of timber going into it you might have to reconsider the waterline !!
That was some incredible work!
Amazing workmanship and artistry.
Pete really now?  Your craft is great! This is the best in boatbuilding I have seen in a long time!!!!
There is no chanel that makes me feel so good as this one. Magic.
Will you be making the kings planks out of Teak, also?
Richard gave a great example of "work smarter".
Just nice to know that my grandchildren will be able to see the finished boat.
I can say only : WOW WOW!
Hey Leo, a quick question. I read/heard about decking which has a nib board running inside the cover boards which takes all the nibs and that keeps your cover boards full width with no exposed end grain. This way you can replace your decking and even reconfigure the nibs without touching your cover boards. Any thoughts on this?
That was some wonderful templating and work. Boat building is artistry, alchemy, and good for the soul.
Good luck back East, Rowen!
Brilliant
Looking great
*Mulai dari kapal rusak, pembongkaran awal, penyediaan bahan baku, lanjut ke perbaikan pemulihan kapal, mengundang datang pemilik kapal sebelumnya (sepasang suami-istri) ke work shop, kemudian pemindahan kapal dari halaman belakang rumah ke dermaga, keluar-masuk crew lama & baru hingga video ini dirilis.. Dari subscriber puluhan orang sampai 400 ribuan, kenapa belum juga selesai ?*
Yay, Wisconsin! Welcome to the team, George!
I feel like I'm watching a masterpiece being made for the world to admire for all time.
I'm watching the episodes in order after stumbling in where you were putting the keel bolts in.  Presently at the point where you examine the hull for fairness and compare it with the plans and decide make new frames by lofting from the plans.  Fun to watch.  You explain and demonstrate lofting well--not that I'm following everything completely!  Seeing the process, I'm thinking that there was really no question of restoring the boat to its original shape by futzing around with the existing boat.  Did you realize this as you proceeded? Ever wish you'd just taken the original ballast keel and built new from there?  (I'm thinking no, that you learned a lot from disassembling the original boat and can keep the restoration/rebuild closer to the original because of that, not to mention carefully salvaging re-usable parts.  But, this took much more time than building new, no?)  Thanks for doing the project and sharing the process so splendidly.  It's an absolute delight to see your work.  Don't imagine you have much time for reading comments but thought I'd write anyway.  Carry on!
So enjoyable--the mix of letting the team spirit and individual qualities of your crew shine, and letting us enjoy the progress on the project!
We were just in Port Townsend earlier this week and drove by your "shed". Would have loved to see your project but wanted to respect your privacy and work space. Can't wait to see Tally Ho finally launched. Your videos are so well produced and have brought us so many, many hours of entertainment. Thank you, Leo.
Mighty fine....
Stunning!❤️👍🇨🇦
“Wood don’t grow in trees” 😅
I just love watching these videos.  The quality of work by everyone in the whole crew is amazing.  They are all craftsman’s on the highest level.  I wish the boat was closer to Los Angeles because I would love to help out.  I hope someday the Tally Ho can make a stop here in Southern California on it way to England.
superbe travail, bravo.
*5 YEARS IVE BEEN WATCHING THIS* I honestly thought it was about 2 years...
Omg I can die now knowing that I've seen the most amazing thing in history! Buddy was so fussy he was at the joints with a flashlight ffs! Last week I thought I was a master carpenter when I replaced a board on my back steps ffs
I have wept so many tears watching your videos, Leo. Tears of joy. Of Inspiration. Of just the sheer beauty as she takes shape in the hands of so many of your craftspeople.  So many tears, in fact, that I have come to believe that she will float anywhere, everywhere, always and forever,  safely, for you and all who sail her, as my salt has been added into your dream. Bless you.
It is a special kind of person that can lead a team of artisans and craftsmen exhibited here. And to keep them all satisfied with their own reward proves an industry unto its self. Leo, a master of many serves them all. Thanks.
Leo, to put the attentional detail into perspective…….please tell us the amount of time it took Pete to craft the first covering board. I have a feeling the magic of editing  doesn’t reflect the true time  commitment.  This project and your team’s skills blow me away with each and every new video.
Dear Leo Goolden respectively Tally Ho team. 👍👌👏 Extraordinary well done again and as always (video and work). Before watching the videos about this great project, I definitely had no clue, how precise these kind of boats/ships had been built respectively how precise they have to be produced. I couldn't even imagine it. For instance this vid shows big, heavy, wide and long but nevertheless extremely well fitted teak hardwood covering boards. Kudos, very impressive work! 2) I'm glad and love to see, that more of the used Tally Ho material will be put to use again. Maybe my favourite videos are the ones about the transom. Of course it's pretty hard to decide because all videos are simply fantastic. Thanks a lot for making teaching explaining recording editing uploading and sharing. Best regards luck and health to all of you.
Thank you.
Wow.
Beautiful work lads
which species of wood smells the best when sawn, and which smells the worst?
Did you put a strand of cotton between the sheer strake and covering board joint?  Larry pardey trick for water tightness.
Hi Guys, Love this channel! Question? Why are the deck planks and cover boards so thick? Seems excessive and sounds super heavy?
Will you be offering any of the teak scrap pieces for sale as souviniers for your followers, maybe with a burned in Tally Ho . Also know there are artists/craftspeople that make very small intricate items from exotic wood that could use those scraps. Maybe even tiny Tally Ho copies. Just a thought. Also how about a comedic lead in to a video with the white haired volunteer without a ball cap on opening with him saying "Hi, my name is Leo and I have been working on my project for 75 years etc. Followers may get a kick out of that.
113yrs years old. Will be refreshed and better than new soon.
Brilliant, Brethren of the Seafaring hard and fibrous substance from the Tree 🎄.  One love the Team, the Project and this projection 📽️. Thank you everyone.  🥇  👋🏻🌱
had to watch it again, a  wonderful piece of carpentry
my hands shake too much to attempt the accuracy you see here........craftsmanship will hopefully never go "out of style
I admire the workmanship, but also am disquieted by the amount of rare timber being used to make a boat that could be made from cheap and plentiful timbers if modern epoxy strip cedar methods were used. Is it ever okay to use rare rainforest timbers, even if the outcome is a great thing?
Just beautiful work great to watch . Allan
how much has this cost so far?
Leo and Boys well done! To save that ship from Dereliction and bring it back to it's shining Beauty Is a Great and magnificent Feat!
A piece of art
Absolutely gorgeous! Well done team!
The original wood from the Tally Ho could theoretically be as old as this nation. As of today I have just finished binging this series. Amazing to see how far it has come.
Love watching Pete work.
The new guy looked stoned ... keep him away from the machinery.
Wow.
what amazing skill and work that the team is doing on rebuilding this beautiful boat
Absolute pros...and some joke about stanchions
exceptionally good work
What an awesome Work !  But i can't remember the original Deck beeing build like that. Long ago.....5 Years now? With such a bunch of good people building an old Ship...it shows their Heart in every Nail and Piece of Wood ! 👍
Gorgeous
Pete is frickin amazing.
Measuring with a stick or two of wood is how it was done for centuries, the tape measure is really new. My Dad always called measuring instruments, his measuring piece. It took me forty some years before it came to me one day what he meant.
the Boards, made by heart
Maybe I missed it but was there a discussion on why the covering boards joined in the middle of the slots for the stanchions?
It is safe to say Pete has some amazing skills. Zeal (sp?) is just as talented. Richard is a legend. All of you ROCK! Is it a contest to understand Pete's message?
Wonderful craftsmanship, a pleasure to see. Congratulations. Where did you get the teak?
ok im hooked on this now
Awesome job.
The interleaving of the planking and the covering boards is just stunning! That fit is so impressive and also so satisfying! :D
I don't know anything about sailing but  I been watching this whole process since the beginning and makes me want to buy a sailboat
Thank you for taking us along for the journey
That was serious precision woodwork measuring and fitting those covering boards Zeal & Pete! Brilliant to watch you guys at work. Have a great holiday Zeak , hope to see you back on Tally Ho after the summer.
Leo, Since you’re in the same yard, could you possibly let Chris Chase know that his viewers are waiting… I sub’d to the Western Flier channel and that led me to your channel.   A lot of us viewers live vicariously through these channels so to just pull the plug is mental.   We’re so glad that you’re committed to sharing your life’s work and ambition with us. Tally Ho’s story is amazing, and the commitment you have to not only restore her, but to share it all with the world. No matter the criticism you likely get, as ya can’t please everyone. 😂   So also, I had asked ya about tools many, many episodes ago, and what you will take along. You’ve showed your layout of Tally Ho, but where’s the Bosuns Locker? How much room will ya have there?   God those covering boards are turning out nicely!!!  Is it Sunday yet!!!!!????!!!!
There are some truly amazing craftsmen on this project, doing great guys.
Beautiful
The best ! Thanks for the vids
Thanks for sharing! Magnificent work! Just thinking of all the angles is giving me headache.
Always learning something new.  Thanks, Richard, for the quick tutorial on measuring inside dimensions without a tape measure.  Simple, but accurate.
So pretty. Lovely to see the team back together. I’m so excited to see this finished but it will be bittersweet when it arrives.
11:30 - basically a makeshift telescopic measuring rod.
A small metal detector can realy help with those old boards. hey from down under
Nice music, great work all round .
Beautiful as always guys! I love not using a tape measure as well a stick and a mark is just as accurate and the look on someone's face when I works out is worth it every time.
"Cross all your. "t"'s and"dot your lower case J's".  Lol...
Bravo Pete and Zeal.
where are you going to store the fishing poles and nets?
Another great installment!  Particularly enjoyed the music.  Thanks again.
Your videos are therapy for me after watching some other builders.     Interesting boat in the shop next to you   I’m guessing  race boat from the 50s
2" thick teak planks blows my mind
Hey Pete @ 2:36 and that's what she said 😯😬😵🕺🕺🕺🕺🕺😅😅😂
Pete really knows what the hell he’s doing…
Craftsmanship at it’s best!
Beautiful
Absolutely AWSOME intro music! Dotting all your "lower case j's"
The workmanship just blows me away!
You wouldn't happen to have any of the off cuts from the cover boards that you would be willing to sell would you?
This is the highlight of my week. You guys inspire me to get back in the shop.
Love the video as always. Great to see the progress. On a side note, does anyone have an update on the Western Flyer? I haven't seen a video come out from them in ages.
Good to see Pete coming out of his shell. I knew there was a clown/spokes model in there somewhere. 😂😂😂👍🏻
Excellent...as usual.....Thanks Leo!
Does these new comers on the Tally Ho knows that volunteers in the past are now casted into the lead keel of the boat? LOL! One more thing, if our forefathers took this long to build boats, India with all of its spices would still not have been discovered, ANOTHER JOKE FOLKS!
The idea of making those cover boards fills me with dread, I can't imagine dealing all of those very close fits at all different angles. Huge, huge respect to Pete and Zeal's craftsmanship.
I hate to sound like a broken record, but the level of craftsmanship.  Holy Cow!!  Just impressive.  Pete, Leo, Richard continue to deliver, heck, everyone is just setting a high standard of quality craftsmanship.   I look forward with great anticipation for each installment!  Thank you, again, for sharing.
Wow.  Nice work on the cover boards.  Cool too seeing some of the old planking being rehabilitated for incorporation in the rebuild.
Nice one Leo. One of your best videos.
Leo, you should think of selling merchandise, I think it would sell really well. You have a very strong brand name now, people would buy.
Those cover boards are just insane. The craftsmanship is absolutely next level, seen so many things on this project that has blown me out of the water (excuse the pun)! A truly epic project.
In absolute awe of the craftsmanship of this team. Bravo!
"Nice video Leo".They fit like a glove. great work.
In the words of the Samurai Carpenter: That's poetry!
Just emphasising the fact that the cover boards are a work of art. Incredible
Watching those videos has had an excellent effect on my woodworking. I have made two garden planters! Still need to work on the tolerances and cutting to precise size, but its fun!
Fun to watch.
Those teak cutoffs would make good limited edition door stops. Just sayin'.
Mad skills!! 😮
Hi Leo, I think you should give credit to all the people who work on the project for the very high standard of their carpentry. People who don't play a musical instrument often fail to recognise how good musicians because they dont know what is involved. I have to do some carpentry for my job in old buildings, and I am so impressed by the accuracy of all yours and your helpers work. Making the teak covering boards so accurately was a masterpiece. It would be easy for viewers to think "I could do that" but they really cant. Well done to Pete and all the crew what outstanding craftsmen and women
Try c s and n “Southern Cross”.
Wow! What a series of angles ,curves and profiles to take in to consideration. I am so impressed by the skill of the guys you have attracted to this project and I hope it is a great learning tool for aspirant shipwrights.
💖💖
Fun little moments when Acorn to Arabella and Tally Ho are in synch!
Beautiful
beautiful wood and work.
Does anyone know the music in the intro... got to be one of the best things on youtube. I look forward to every episode
Pity to hear Zeal is going to do some gillnet fishing. Wasn't that highly illegal? It super cruel to marine life when a net is lost while out there.... Line and hook seems tthe way to go. Stunning boards though. I guess we can't have it all.
So this guy falls under a train losing both lower limbs and sues the railroad company.  But when he gets to court the judge throws the case out citing: “I appreciate that you lost your legs, but in this case, you don’t have a leg to stand on”…..or something like that….
Leo you are building movie start from yours wood worker  (excelente work you are part of the history of boat building for the future, I hope to see you in the way to England ,here in Marina Del Rey California
You guys are really doing an incredible job, and that commands respect.... Congratulation!!!
Teak: the king of woods! Sure is scary working with it. So expensive! I love how it all fits together perfectly with a puff of sawdust. Glad it happens for some people.
Those Teak planks look like at least $500 each?
The Rolls Royce among wooden boat building and videos! (perhaps, I should say "Cadillac"?)
You guys never cease to impress me with your craftsmanship.  Well done.
Masterful craftsmanship.. simply beautiful.. seemingly effortless perfection..
Most satisfying jigsaw puzzle I've ever seen! Good work as always!
Bravo
22:20 degustace dřeva :-)
Beautiful craftsmanship
Great work guys, so much talent!
Leo you should glue lam the off cuts of teak into signed chopping boards and auction them off
Sure looks nice with those teak cover boards against the cedar decking.  That will be a real point of satisfaction to look at in your future years of sailing Tally Ho.
I had no idea glue guns, and arts and crafts in general, are such an integral part to boat building. Lol. Of course I never would have guessed chain saws to be so important as well. Lol
Crews back together 👍 those cover boards look sweet🪚
👍🏼🍻
PETE! Pete! PETE! Pete! PETE! Pete! PETE! Pete! PETE! Pete! PETE! Pete! PETE! Pete! Yep.
What a nice work!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
its great to see you all doing amazing woodcraft i have been impressed of the skill of you all ,thank you for making me enjoy boat building
Fantastic job by Pete and Zeal. Love to see the craftsmanship and their talent.
Beautiful work. It does make me wonder if Leo will see dollar signs in his head every time something on his boat gets even slightly damaged for the next 50 years. I know I would. I see dollar signs every time my boat touches anything other than water.
Hey Leo, The episodes are far too short. Time stops for me when I am watching and when an episode finishes I experience a little remorse. Please put some music on and let the camera run. Am I alone feeling this way? Amazing craftsmanship as always.
Holy Smokes !!!  The carpentry skills of this team is off the charts. Not enough words in the modern English language to describe it adequately. Well done guys.
Lookin good!
Awesome work gentlemen! best of luck fishing and look forward to your return.  Leo, you have done an amazing job of finding shipwrights!  here in Oklahoma we basically have no one....
Pete is a master.
Love this channel. One of my favourite episodes.
It is an extraordinary delight to watch Pete and Zeal craft those cover boards. Their accuracy is phenomenal. Just an amazing project Leo that keeps on giving
I’m making an epic trip of the Pacific US on my motorcycle. I rode past the ship yard in port Townsend a couple days ago. I know you guys are busy so I didn’t try to disturb you. I just took a selfie and kept on riding. We are in Golden Beach Oregon now.
Those covering board fits are insane!! So impressive. Well done fellas!
That storm in Ontario May 21, 2022 had our 24' fiberglass hull heeled into the dock a bit, ripped out one of my Stanchions. Now I see that word everywhere... :)
just waiting for an episode where halfway through leo fades in and goes like "well, we cut come expensive wood a quarter of an inch too small. not really anything we can do about it, the board can't fit, there isnt any wood to spare. we are gonna be replacing that piece with particle board-"
Hey Leo,  I'd bank you'd take first, for best restoration at the classic.
Hello guys....
What type of wood are the wood sheets for the patterns? and do you intend to store them for potential future maintenance work?
What a great team.
So this is very impressive craftsmanship, but there have no mistakes? Be interesting to hear about some mistakes as they are learning events. And, a note about who and how this team is sharpening their tools. Great stuff
Been watching a long time. One of my favorites. Loved the woodwork in this one.
A real  privilege to watch the process of marking and painstakingly cutting the cover boards. How do the angles of the stanchion holes  get accurately transferred to the other sides of the boards? The patterns will give the position of them just above the deck surface but how you accurately get the position at the top surface of the board allowing for the various angles?
I've been watching the channel for a little while and recently binged the first 70 episodes or so and I love seeing how it started vs where it is.  Old rotten teak was the holy grail at the start, and now it's like..... yeah we're certainly using teak.  I love the journey and I have to say it looks about 2 years away from setting sail.
Hey Leo …, I have been following you from the very beginning of this project…, so glad you decided to take on such a massive endeavor, to the delight of viewers like me.., the dedication and craftsmanship required for this epic endeavor…, yes Epic .., because it really is .., is astounding.., and I commend you my friend for taking this project on , and to heart…, I look forward to more episodes.., and the eventual launching of this historic vessel!
Such a great video! You guys are true artists. The precision and attention to detail is sensational. Truly amazing project. Incredible! I Have been watching since the very beginning. The artistry never ceases to amaze! Magnificent!
I CAN'T WAIT  to see if it  floats!
Awesome work guys...Nice to see you back !!
The sweetness of doing a job perfectly.
Nothing like having no extra material!
Great video!
Excellent work crew! Just amazing to see you chopping through 8/4 teak like that. Anyone have a name for the plane Pete was using, with the iron on the front edge of the tool? That's how it looks at least...anyway, awesome work.
Definitely one of my favorite episodes. Pete was definitely the star. I just loved how he first explained, then demonstrated the template creation, then actually showed us as he was doing it. I would like to say he made it look easy, but nothing about that looked easy. With this inspiration, and some time, I hope to eventually be able to make a box.
Leo, please tell your guys that it is a DELIGHT to watch their talents create such a beautiful creation - LOVE it!   TY for sharing!
Fantastic work by Pete & Zeal for such precision craftsmanship on such a delicate operation on premium materials.  You picked a couple of great craftsman to help Leo and I wish Zeal the best and hope to see him back in a couple of months.  Great to see Richard & welcome aboard George!  Your contributions enhance the project and make Tally Ho an awesome beauty.  Great editing as always Leo and most of all thanks for sharing!
Again, I must say the wood work skill of the team is astounding!  It is a pleasure to watch.  Thank you Leo!
Teak, whatever... "Until you make something nice, it's just a piece of wood."
The measuring, pattern making & cutting with precision is absolutely beautiful. Job well done.
"Worked for a couple of years without a tape measure" - Larry Huan would be proud. :)
Your wood work is gorgeous, but your geography is much less so.  The arrow on the Alaska map does not point to Bristol Bay--so, keep up the grand wood work.
There's a lot of top-notch work there ....
I love boats, and I love wood, but as a farmer it's disheartening to know of all the remarkable wooden vessels of times past, crafted with many lifetimes worth of hours, with love, launched and sailed with pride, that are built out of compost.  Out of many tens of thousands, only a few remain. Yes, to bacteria and fungus, wood is just food.
There of course remains the devil to pay.
Gorgeous hunks of teak! Love to see such craftsmanship come together seamlessly. Hats off to you guys...
The precision that these people work blows my mind.
Crossover idea: one of the crew is bound to be a musician? How about a guitar build with Crimson Guitars. Maybe you could use offcuts from the Tallyho. Or some of the original wood?
Looking magnificent
I don't know the current board foot price of teak these days but no fubares is GOOD! Excellent work guy's!
the cut off Pete's jib was on point this whole video.
Nice back Ground Music!
I just want to say that you are a group of people who bring so much (I want to say joy?) to so many of us. I just wish more people in the world could see this story. It makes my week when a new episode comes out.
Looking good.
Absolutely fantastic!
So good to see the quality coming through.Thanks Guys
I watch most of the boat builders on YouTube the amount of joints in this particular episode just goes to show you have probably the best team on YouTube, this particular job shows how good your team is this and has to be one of the most difficult and complex pieces of multiple joints ever,  top marks to all your expert helpers.
What a craftsmanship and how easy each of them make it look. And the edit of this video is marvelous again. It gives me the feeling of being present at the work while the physical distance is enormous. Greetings from the Netherlands
Planning and precision Amazing!
#50 on trending as I'm typing this. Seems like Tally Ho is getting out there
Oh my! I wouldn’t trust myself to cut one of the ply templates, let alone raise a blade to that gorgeous teak. Pete & Zeal show craftsmanship of the highest possible order. Sometimes I think ‘yeah, I could do it that’ … but not this time! Well done everyone.
The best work I’ve seen on many channels I seen. Beautiful. I’ve learned so much just by watching your videos.
C'est de toute beauté
The contrast between the woods is stunning. 👍
26:04 nice symbol there lol
Alright, Pete! Very happy to see your work on the deck planks/ patterns! All of those precice, measurements and cut outs!Great job, Pete!😀👌
So many great people have come and gone through this project; including Rowen..........I wish the best for all of them!!  DD
Just outstanding carpentry. Amazing that there are people like you guys with these skills. Awe inspiring 😎
Obviously, I love the boat project footage, but I do love the film clips around the yard!  DD
Couple of things: Pete looks yo be healthier and happier than when we first met him. I hope that this signals that things are going well for him these days, I'd be glad if that were the case. He's such a funny and knowledgeable guy. Secondly, I have been accused of being a carpenter on a spare few occasions, but never a good one. Just enough experience to know that what those guys did with the covering boards is exceptional. Wow.
Love watching what you do, love your videos...
These guys are master carpenters it’s amazing, they really should be proud of their amazing skills
👍👍👍
I’ve heard that the two most dangerous things in a shop are a tired operator and a dull tool. How do you keep all your tools sharp?
I look forward to these videos every two weeks.
Wow n stuff. Amazing
The covering boards are really gorgeous ! Also, even it's a detail, I really loved the sawing censorship at 4:05. Leo might be a boat builder and a sailor, but he's also been a full-fledged youtuber for some time now. :) Keep it up, guys, you rock !
Leo,    Really enjoy the videos. I am finally responding after finding the Tally Ho or as I had come to know her Escape missing from Brookings, Oregon back in January 2021 or was 2020.  I had the pleasure of sailing on her from  December 1984 to June 1985. I've kept up with the boat since and even more so after finding you on YouTube. I was one of five people that took her to Pitcairn, Marquises and Hawaii on a pleasure cruise. I took over a thousand pictures and would be happy to share them with you if you have an interest. They are 35mm slides. Many of the pictures are of life on the boat while sailing, destinations visited and folks we met. I live in the Portland Or area and would be happy to come up to Port Townsend and share what I know about the boat at that time in her life. Keep up the great work!!  THX

Nushigak or Norton Sound? (map) Either way, enjoy the summer!
Fantastic craftsmanship throughout, outstanding video as well. I look forwards to every episode, thank you so much.
Any estimate of what her displacement is going to be? She looks immensably sturdy.
As a guitar builder, templates r key. The fitment on those boards is outstanding. Love the project been watching for years…
impressive😊😊.
Excellent progress by you and the team!!
Pay day Friday means Sampson Saturday.
Auto un-subbed. anyone else?
As I'm sure you are aware Leo, you have an amazing team of people involved in the Tally Ho restoration project. Altho' they have differing levels of expertise, they all seem to share the same passion for working with wood. It's spellbinding to watch this beautiful ship take shape. Thank you.
What tune is Pete singing along to? Any chance of a Tally Ho playlist one of these days?
beautiful work.
I bought a left side blade circular saw and my cuts got so much more precise and comfortable. I will never go back! For those of you who care…
Those covering boards probably cost the same as a small recreational sailboat. Hope you found a good teak pusher..
I think it's safe to say we ALL Like the cut of Pete's jib.
Why did you joint the coverboards at the stanchions?
Such beautiful artwork. Honestly this boat could be displayed in an art museum
been following these project since 2020.... pretty impressive how far has come. i remember having covid and being in isolation in my room looking for something to watch on YouTube and found this channel..  since then i haven't missed one episode
Leo you and the crew doing a beautiful job on this old girl 👍
A really nice job!! Great teamwork!!🙂🦝👍✌👋🛥⚓
Very very nice fit
You oughta make knick-knacks out of the teak cut-offs. I’m sure lots of supporters would love a commemorative piece of the Tally-Ho deck! Just some rounds cut from a dowel or something easy and small could be a nice way to use the scraps and raise funds.
21:48 Did I spy a Muehle-Glashütte SAR Rescue Timer?
So nice
Fantastic job, and maybe the best video yet on probably the hardest piece to do.  Any chance you could sell some of the pieces of unused teak as souvenirs?
The teak your using is to say the least EXPENSIVE. Your crew did a fine job of fitting it all. Congratulations.
Wow that deck looks amazing, well done Team Tally Ho!
Fascinating,  thx, for the clip.
So satisfying to watch the progress and result of the covering boards.  Does anybody know the name of that block plane that had a blade out front?  I must have one!
Superb workmanship on the coverboards. A work of art guys.
Young men sail away on their father’s dreams to challenge the winds and tides. Sometimes they find themselves lost at sea with nowhere left to hide. A beacon shines from yonder shore and beckons the sailors home. The light comes from the Father, safe harbor for lost souls.
I'm interested to know why they don't screw on a sacrificial rub strake on the outside of the coverboard, which will inevitably get damaged sometime during the life of this vessel. I would think it's much easier to replace a rub strake than repair a damaged coverboard.
Isn't it scary to fit the covering boards? Great Job. I love it.
What a journey this project has been
21:24 Ha! A Bristol Bay fisherman! Nushagak river no less. I spent my first nine years in Dillingham. My father first started fishing Bristol Bay in the sail boat days (1924 or so). He was also a school teacher.  I still get the Nushagak  and the Kvichak rivers mixed up 60+ years later (silly me). Have a safe and prosperous season.
When you look at the steel guys compared to the wooden boats  Being am experienced metal worker myself but having no carpentry experience  The steel work really is heavy dirty work and the wood work is nearly an artwork  The steel work certainly is a skill in its self but the likes of the cover plank  A major fuckup puts you back a long way looking for new material  You can literally cut a steel boat clean in half amd just weld it back together
I know you all thought those planks were satisfying to watch, but the covering boards are much more so.
Whiting this fitting happen with zero errors is a joy! Thanks guys, great work!
You guys are the true Craftsmen!!
Tell you what? Pete's work is pretty slick.
Looks like making puzzle pieces.  Your level craftsmanship is amazing.
Great episode!
Can’t imagine the price of all the wood used.
Once again, the pleasure of watching some superb woodworking, thanks for all the videos so far, don't wish to watch launching, get all that lovely wood wet?
This was more like watching a fine cabinetry video then a boat rebuilding video. Impressive work.
hard not to want a chisel plane after watching this one!
Amazing bit of joinery there, guys. Just WOW!
What a crew of true craftsman. Very impressive.
Laughing and joking is as much of the job as anything, but then comes the moment, "OK I got to make this cut." That means I'm checking out of the fun and need to concentrate. Love this kind of work!!!!
Man! If it makes Pete nervous it must be bad!. I'M SCARED!
Amazing talent 👏
I reckon it's great how you actually explain everything that your doing so we all understand what your building and talking about 👍
That is beautiful!
teak 2x12s !?
These boys can move wood and make dust. in a good way.
It's kind of nice to know that even with all your experience that you still get nervous cutting into a nice piece of wood
Lowercase j's🤣
Please God don't let me ....edit....up!!!
“I’m the idiot that might be buying this boat!(EP 1 )” Well you don’t look like such an idiot now, Leo. Bravo.  Well done.  It’s been an incredible journey so far and I am positive it will be moving forward too.
Beautiful piece of work indeed Leo. We all really, really appreciate the work the crew are doing every step of the way.
Great work!
Looks fantastic! Amazing pieces of teak
👍👍👍👍
That’s the part that sank my trawler, worn out covering boards. But she’s looking beautiful Leo ✌️🇬🇧
How the hell does one young man possess so much talent and skill? Bravo!
ihr macht eine tolle Arbeit.
16.13 A portrait of Albert Strange perhaps?
Pete is a bloody champion!
ABSOLUTE ART!!!! Pete and Zeal are truly talented craftsmen! YOH!!!!! Give them a Bells!
Awesome!
Pure craftsmanship. Looks fantastic.
Love seeing the old wood being recycled
Not only is this boat being built to incredibly exacting standards but it is going to be a really beautiful looking craft with the different colours of timber. Have watched this since episode 1, never dreaming it would be such a great work of art. Well done to everyone involved. 👏👏👏👏👏
Ahh yes, much better. Not just an intense focus on craft skills. Much more focus on personalities in interplay with each other and the precious materials they have available to get the job done. As for bringing random scenes from the boatyard together with music and visual rhythm, just brilliant.  I still think recruiting a woman or two to the team would add a lot. And, on a completely different tack, where is Pancho?
I thought that the quality of the work cannot get any more ridiculous. I was wrong.
A truly great video, so pleased to see Pete back. I hope it's not too long before the other guy is back from Alaska he's a really good guy and a really good team member.
He looks like off brand ltt
Great great work, made with own hands!
it fits perfectly, insane measuring.
That “sticks-measuring-trick” from Richard was priceless! That sort of tricks are so worthy on this channel. Those covering boards look b.e.a.u.t.i.f.ul.!!!!! What a class shipwright job that is! Very impressive! Looking forward to completion of the trim of them!
I am in awe of the workmanship on those Covering boards, I wish I could smell the wood!
Great work guys. Amazing worksmanship
Was that Pete singing a little bit of Townes Van Zandt I heard at 15:08? A man of impeccable taste.
Captain Leo and Vice Captain Pete 😎😎😎
Some pretty impressive machining there! Even topside looks like a boat now!
Absolutely painstaking work!
Another great video, thank you. This one will get a second viewing !!
Wow….that is one hell of a result! And to see how it is done..Tally Ho is going to be a very special boat!
That deck will be gorgeous. 👍
These guys know how to work  WITH the wood
as a corpenter, i am really impressed with your guys work. Everything is thight and snug. its rear for us to work with hardwood, and you guys are doing an amazing job, with great technicus
Beautiful!
Watching these talented craftsmen accomplish this amazing build makes me absolutely gobsmacked  by the skill of the original builders who did all this WITHOUT POWER TOOLS!!!
That is really looking great! Perfect job!
absolutely fantastic, well done team
Great carpentry guy's lookin good, have a nice day all !!!.
Craftsmen have varying degrees of skills.This it’s isn’t just a job to these shipwrights, it’s what they love doing and it’s reflected in the results.
I'm really glad to see some of tally ho's old timbers being redressed , It's awesome to see scabby old timber be repurposed into something pretty and new . i hope theres a lot of this to come !! Well done as always guys !
It made me so happy too see Pete again. It’s midnight and I thought, I can wait till tomorrow to see this video. But after seeing Pete on the thumbnail I thought, I need to see this now.
Looking forward to the next one! Such a great project you are all doing
The outdoor miserable weather shows why the move to Port Townsend was the best thing for Tallyho and it will shorten the project a lot.
Rainy and cold summers... Must remind you of being back home in the UK...
Not tempted to float it around the harbour for an afternoon?
yeah i often wonder whether shipwrights of ..er .. yore would have done a better job and if they would have been allowed to work with templates or if they somehow knew how the angles ran having done them so many times before. my feeling is that they were done in a workmanlike manner but perhaps not as tidily?  i’m only a formworker but we have made some things that are quite complex. i wasn’t allowed to cut with straight edges on site because it takes too much time. i was expected to cut perfectly freehand. you would be surprised what you can do when you must.  :) love your work lads
Always amazed at the accurate craftmanship..  why does Zeal always attack Pete? Not fair, not necessary.
Looking good gentlemen
great to hear a Wisconsin accent.
Hi g great work
Some serious skills again.
I love everything you do and you inspire me
With a little help from friends.... you are a sort of a Beatle
As a weekend warrior wood worker the fitment here seems like magic, I think even seasoned wood workers would be impressed. The wood working throughout the course of this series is so impressive. I have realized while watching all these craftspeople that ship building will highlight the pinnacle of wood working ability. I also love the music choices, this is such an excellent, relaxing YouTube series.
Amazing to watch you guys do such exacting work as if it's nothing at all.
Gorgeous!  Well done Sampson Co. Crew, hard work pays off.
Truly impressive work. Good luck to Zeal, safe travels, and good fishing! Cheers from Tokyo! Stu
Join those two sticks together with a loop on each around the other and that's exactly how I was taught to measure shoring timber for damage control
These coverboards are a work of art 👏🏻👏🏻😍😍 Amazing craftsmanship 👍🏻👍🏻💪🏻💪🏻
17:34 big missed opportunity to call a boat wet dream
A work of art. Such a talented team!
Absolutely amazing craftsmanship!!!!!!!
Absolutely beautiful work ! ❤️❤️❤️
Cheers, team!  All the best to Rowan and enjoy Alaska, Zeal.  Welcome, George!  And I like the cut of your jib too, Pete (I've been wondering what you were doing).  Beautiful joinery, folks!
Impressive even if you take longer using the inefficient and inaccurate Japanese pull saws.
Can we get a bonus video of you guys playing with the dog and the Macaw? They are super cute pets!!
Amazing work as usual. Can you tell us the value of each teak board please?
OMG what craftsmen especially Pete and Richard, you’re very lucky to have them Leo
Can't wait for the launch......... keep up the high quallity standard. Thank you.
ok... who can answer this question....   at 24;18 Pete picks up a plane...   What kind of plane is this?  now I have a 3 in 1 shoulder plane that you can take the nose off and have a 'chisel plane as I would call it to shave into edge of a piece as Pete is doing....  never seen this plane before, is it just a modified bench plane?
Leo, that deck and cover board timber is pure artwork. It will be such a shame to see it get wet for the first time.
Sticks>tape measure=Richard is the Boss
2:38 Huh huh, Beavis, he said "reinserted". :D
Pete is such a good looking man.
Just to watch the guys doing their woodwork gives so much pleasure. The quality of the fit and finish is something that continues to amaze me even after watching every episode, knowing that all involved are true craftsmen.
I've been watching since hear the beginning. Leo has had an incredible knack for getting exactly the right people hands on with this project. If someone wanted to see what skill looks like, watch these men fit these pieces to the boat. I am just blown away by the  talent. I know the proper term is "shipwright" for these two fellows, but I think they are more artisan than anything else. All of the people who have lent their gifts to the build are so danged talented I feel like I should never touch a piece of lumber again, LOL. Really, really amazing to watch.
12:11 The money shot of this episode: Pete being deeply satisfied after being thrilled so much by that lump of teak. Good moment to witness! Give the cameraman a rise - or was it the boss himself, knowing about the feeling and waiting for the look? Philosophical question: with Zeal cutting and fitting the other side - do they compete or comzeal here....?
What a great crew you have put together Leo. Experience plus & I'm sure everybody would be taking another skill away with them that they never knew before. Thanks for Sharing. Been here since the start & love seeing the fantastic progress. Billy J... Queensland, Australia.
Very satisfying!
Best video yet. Break pays off!
Having good carpenter friends isn't replaceable.  Great job Pete and Zeal!!   P.s.  it's good to see Pete back. That's my dude and its good to see a new volunteer.  Keep doing your thing Leo.  Your such an inspiration.
Leo, you started out to rebuild an old boat, but I think it’s turn out you’ve built some great friendships.
All I kept thinking was that Teak must cost a million dollars! 😂🤣 (might not be to far off from the actual price .. lol).
Old man's cranking a dart at the planer 23:20 puff puff
Good to see everyone back. Those covering boards are pieces of art. Beautiful work Pete and Zeal. I've used Richard's stick trick before when doing drawers in cabinets. Can certainly prevent errors. Thank you all for another wonderful video.
Been watching and liking for a couple of years.. I really appreciate both the skill sets shown and filming/documentation of this project. Thank you!
Leo, you are so fortunate to have such talented craftsmanship on your project. It is such a pleasure to see these people go about their trade. Thanks for the video.
Tally Ho just keeps on looking better every time. Great work, Pete and Zeal, on those covering boards. (Seems Zeal has a bit of a man crush on Pete hehehehe!). Oh, love the new overalls, Pete! What a stunning team doing stunning work!
Pete, you the man.
3 things men love to watch, fire, water and other men working.
I swear, everytime I say " Man, I need something to watch!", You guys come out with a new video! Best timing ever! XD
Utterly stunning. Great work.
how much does such extravagant pieces of teak cost these days?  who donated all the kidneys to fund this teak?
Looks like it’s getting there
Another video they all can be satisfied with. Did anyone else think the 2" teak rub rail is too light for a real bump? Im not a shipright.
...their precision is so precise, I’ll bet the cover boards would fit on either side...
Also, can I buy one of those little triangle shaped off cuts from the covering board?
glad your all back, excited to see the deck and interior come together. I feel rigging coming soon. that will be very interesting for sure. Leo, so proud for you I am seeing this project getting close to looking like a complete boat. CAN'T WAIT to see her launched and floating.
Great job guys,   as usual!
Oh yeah! The board disappears at the kerf.
I really enjoy Pets antics. The deck is turning out AMAZING! Thank you for continuing to post these videos as they have given me something to look forward to. May your seas be calm and the wind at your back.
Excellent video - thanks for taking the time to show how these planks were installed. It really shows how difficult the job was, and the skills of the people involved!
Once again I am so amazed of the way you work, all those details - it’s fantastic
I'm convinced this team could do anything
I was just thinking today I’ve spent a fair amount of hours watching Leo and his team over the last 4 years…. Hours I cannot relive… hours of my life I decided to spend here and I have to say it’s been time well spent.   I’ve been captivated the entire time and continue to watch and just shake my head saying, “holy crap” at the highest level work a human can produce.  Such a joy.  Seeing 2” thick teak timbers is amazing.  What are those like $1000 boards?  Holy crap!  😁
Always a Joy and a Pleasure, each and every vid. Love the ever evolving journey this project is. Can't find better context than this on YouTube.
I really enjoy the chill vibe of the outdoor shots. Seeing some snippets of everyday life in the yard is pretty cool.
Wow 🤩 looks amazing 👍🏻👍🏻
She is so beautiful it makes me cry!
I really liked this episode a lot less chitchat, focusing more on the craftsmanship.
where did you get your teak?...
Those coverboard off cuts would make great momentos.
Amazing
" I worked for two years without a tape measure."  Best quote EVER!!!  LOL...
great.:)
These guys are working on this boat like it’s for a king ! Taking their time everything looks perfect !
Amazing work! I hope to be that good one day.
That deck is gorgeous!
Covering boards! So fussy, but so satisfying once they're done! Thanks for the update! Take good care!
Beautiful work, as always. True craftsmen, the lot of you. Thanks for sharing your progress.
When Pete fitted that second covering board, wow, the pride and satisfaction is hard to imagine. Good work everyone
Hey Leo!!! So cool to see the project coming along. Im just coming by to tell you that because of these videos I discovered the Northwest School of Wooden Boat Building and am one of the Fifty Students Attending in the fall of 2022. Just wanted to let you know that your mission of sharing the world of wooden boat building is definitely a success and that you should be very proud of what you’ve accomplished. Thank you so much- May/Brody
you have an amazing team there. This boat is truly a work of art. I really hope to see it in the future. You all should be very proud!
Nice work 👍
Are you selling any of the scrap teak from your project? Would like to buy a piece of what you guys are working on. Amazing work you and your team are doing.
I have long been impressed with the quality of the workmanship on Talley Ho project. But, I am so pleased to watch this latest video. The workmanship is impeccable. And the hint at the repurposing of the original deck planks! I am so stoked. Keep up the good work.
I can't be the only person who wants to know, even casually, how much those covering boards cost? In material only...You just can't help but appreciate the workmanship all through this project. It's obvious that all of these people, all through the process are so well suited for their chosen profession, even if it's just one of many capabilities...
Such a joy to watch.  Absolutely fascinating!
Been following from the beginning, and continue to be impressed with the quality of the crew. It's a tribute to Leo's management style. Pete's on camera explanations have come a helva long way, and still manages to make me smile. Mike  🇦🇺
Great fit on those cover boards!!!
Rowan was awesome. Hope to see him back.
2 years?
Have you thought about taking the off cuts of exotic wood and  making coins with the image of Tally Ho to sell. This help offset some of the expenses.
Leo, I subscribe to over 20 different content creators on YouTube that I watch regularly, but none have captured my interest the way the restoration to Tally Ho has. Nor are new episodes more eagerly awaited than on this channel. I'm still hoping for/looking forward to weekly instalments of this great project.
Great episode guys! I was happy to hear Zeol (sp?) was headed up to the Nushagak area of Bristol Bay. I spent 5 wonderful summers working with that specific drainage for the Alaska Dept. of Fish and Game. While I’m sad to see him go, I’m excited to see who the new member of this awesome team will be. Keep up the great work guys!
21:32  Gill netting.  PHAHCK,, gill nets are the scourge of the seas.  Gill netters are scum.  Lost gill nets go on fishing forever.  Shame on you for your mercenary desires to go gill netting.  Hook and line are the eco friendly way.
I love how the team, even after so long, just keeps working so well together. A well-oiled machine. Go Tally Ho!
Hey Pete.. you're a class act...Many thanks.
400k another very interesting episode! Thanks
Can we see Pete’s dog in an upcoming episode? Hope she is ok.
beautifull work. loving all the hand tools in action.
Well this was fun...
Fitting those covering boards required a lot of skill and patience.  Pretty impressive seeing it all come together so well.  🙂
Darn, you guys are good! Says the very impressed cabinet maker. 😮
I am a heavy equipment mechanic, not a shipwright. I like working with wood, but there is a reason I am a mechanic and not a shipwright. The fit and detail that every piece of wood that goes into TallyHo are truly amazing. I'm very good at what I do, but DAMN, you guys are incredible.  From one tradesman to another, good job guys! You have my respect.
Great job al of you. Wish I could have been a part of it.
You should use the teak wood scraps to make cubes with tally ho branded into them. I’d be willing to bet a lot of your followers would be happy to spend a few dollars on them and it would help to continue funding your venture.
Is this a bad time to tell you that the grain on the teak is running backwards!
Yeah it so simple for the arm chair pro's to comment, not like 128k people arn't watching with zoom in critique!
The cowardly step-father rarely bury because tempo elderly flower worth a poised spring. jittery, wary hoe
WHat a beautiful things!
Always interesting to see when processes run in parallel with my other favourite YouTube wooden boat build, to see the different approaches.  Both fully legit for the resources available, and goal function and historic accuracy of the respective boats.
The motif "I turn wood into things what's your superpower" on the tee shirt Richard was wearing is great!
I'm curious in real time how long it took to fit each of those boards?
Really fun to see the cover boards going on
It's a shame I can only hit the "like" button just the once. There needs to be a "this video really made my day" button....
You don't have to thank us... We thank you for allowing us to come with you on your journey through your video's... So a big THANK YOU and all who watch your video's will agree they are the best on YouTube...
heaps of content creators are building or restoring boats and showing us their work, but the standards of fit, finish, and general woodworking that Leo and crew have set are head and shoulders above everyone else.  Work like this is an absolute pleasure to watch, and the product is a thing of beauty.  I hope you are proud of the result.
I have done carpentry all my life and it is hard to impress me. I tip my hat to you guys.
I've been a carpenter for 30 years and the level of craftsmanship is truly amazing, keep up the great work guys, absolutely awesome!!
Curious as to how much those large teak boards cost.
Hopefully the beautiful wood scraps are being used elsewhere on Tally Ho. If not, maybe you could make something simple and quickly from scrap pieces that could be used to raise more funds. e.g. plaques, pencil holders, door stops, etc. Surely many subscribers would love to own a "piece of Tally Ho"!
Great episode! Keep rolling Tally Ho team!! 👍👍
Absolutely incredible craftsmanship!     I love the detail involved in making the templates. How was it done before the invention of hot glue???
umm actually, Pete, wood DOES grow on trees.  Just sayin'.
this boat is a work of art
Fantastic work! Love to see craftsmanship lives.
The art in the workmanship leaves me at a loss for words. The product of their hands will forever crew the vessel and their spirit remain aboard as well.
Really nice work you guys ! I haven't missed  EP.
G'day from downunder, just like to.pass on a story bout covering boards as this senior chippy told me, 'we used to call it the devil plank cause it was a devil of a plank to make, he added that the saying between the devil and the deep blue sea ( ya up to your neck in it ) originated from this ' devil plank ' oh yeh TALLY HO is looking sweet,
Damn that looks good
They made gill nets illegal in Florida
when was the last time you ran a comb thru your hair, you look like i do in the morning before a shower.
man i really noticed how far both Pete and Leo have come in presenting info to the camera in this episode. not that they were bad when they started but i feel like the two of them have grown into such great educators over the course of the project. Tally Ho sure is coming along!
When the teak board is so heavy, it can be planed without any clamping
absolutely awesome some of the original wood is making it's way back onto the boat rebuild ! kudos !
So glad to see the team back in action!
Wow, seriously you guys are amazing, watching just blew me away, so talented. Blessed be.♥️♥️♥️
Haha Pete trying to be an adult after saying reinserted was the greatest!
2:38 Giggity giggity ha ;) Did you consider putting insulation anywhere in the boat? Even if in just one room or something?
Amazing bit of woodwork there ... the kingplanks are going to be just as tricky, if not moreso!
WOW.....looking great and you guys are fabulous carpenters and special trades to do this great workmanship, thanks for sharing
Amazing craftsmanship.
Great team
Looking amazing! I have so much respect for the detailed work that is going into this restoration by everyone involved.
Across all the videos, these joinery achievements are perhaps the most impressive.  Well done indeed.
Leo, Take those teak scraps and burn a picture of Talley Ho on em. Then sell the trophy as original swag. I'd buy a peice.
Looking absolutely gorgeous with the Cover Boards on.
A pleasure to watch.
This boat is pure class!
Just beautiful woodwork by the team. However what happens when a squabble happens between the team? How do you get them all back being focused on what they are doing successfully again Leo?
Without Rowan you wont be able to finish the boat. There`s nobody to put bungs in !!
You fellows never fail to amaze me with the precision and accuracy of your work!! You are truly craftsmen, artisans ,artificers etc etc . I have run out of accolades. Your work is a joy to watch. Phil from OZ
And is that the new 3m sander???
I have never really appreciated how heavy boats are until l have been watching Leo and co for yrs now. Amazed she won't just sink to the bottom of the harbour when launched again?
I haven’t checked… but is there a new “Teak Hero” level on the Patreon at $10K per episode? 😂
Another truly work of art, the cover boards and video.   Pete, you could be a stand up comic if you ever decide to leave your craft. As a matter of fact you, Rowan and Neil could be the next big Vaudeville sensation.  That's a compliment.
Simply awesome!
Have been watching since the first time. Can’t wait to see her sail.
I'm wondering how long and the number of workers involved it took to complete the build the first time around compared to the current gang. With power tools and such would this make a significant difference in labor time? What about any changes in construction methods and concepts adopted that have changed or progressed from that time as well?
No mistakes awesome.  Pete's a real craftsman
No CC!
What a great group of guy's your have. Hello guys.
Great job.  Would love a video every now and then that walks us through what they whole project looks like as a whole at that moment. With lots a individual projects done its hard to get a grasp of the whole thing.
That's some sexy plank work! Beautiful lines! I just really appreciate the quality of the work.
O shit son! That time of week!
I would far rather listen to the sounds of the dock yard than music.
If you ever have doubts Leo,, 90 thousand views in 6 hours. The Internet loves your work. 😉
We all like the cut of Pete’s jib, Patrick.
The arrow on your map to Alaska points to Norton Bay, Bristol Bay is south of there.
Very impressive - your skills, work, and videos are never a let down - still waiting for Tally HO to reclaim her Fastnet crown . It would be amazing ...Keep up the good work..
As always...freaking awesomeness!
11:26 Its nice to see Frank Zappa is helping with the boat too!
Another fabulous video. Great workmanship on the cover boards.
She is going to be such a beautiful lady.  The craftsmanship here is astounding
Amazing precision with those.
LOVE THAT SHIRT "I turn wood into things! What is Your Superpower?" And Patrick and Pete Are starting to look like Brothers LEO
Covering boards. Piece of art. 👍
Love that you are planing down some of the old deck beams. Please show us where and when you use them.
Brilliant!
Knowing and understanding in this day and age of rare (and in some cases protected species of trees) and exotic timber, my heart was in my mouth the whole episode as the lads  cut into that gorgeous Teak.  It will undoubtedly be a highlight of the finished deck. :)
awesome progress Leo
"I use sticks for a lot of things". In the Navy we called it a "Gunther Batten". Same principle. She's looking good guys.
"The umm... (stares off smiling) huhumph" has become the new "that's what she said"
24:59 - WOW
what an epic documentation of an expert build.
Leo today's video showed the skill of all your crew working on the bout wow, what a beautiful job all are doing on this project. Thanks Mark Dutka Oakville Ontario Canada.
Simply stunning. True craftsmen.
i like pete. keep up the good work
Fab as ever. So great to see the progress and the personalities and skills. Of course that 'old wood' isn't just 112 year's old it's probably more like 200-250y. Thank you as others have said for the view. All the best to Zeal. Oh and do look up a 'Gunter Batten' for that measuring without measuring thing.
followed you since the beginning - love everything you do and why you do it.... one annoying comment i'm afraid :(  Hardwoods and dust :(  look after your eyes too !  other PPE is overt the top ... but working with hardwoods will ruin your lungs without ... wetl you know the rest
Magnificent Guys. Too beautiful for words. The work, the team spirit and watching how Pete has developed his 'media confidence' over the course of the project. Altogether, as ever, totally inspiring.
As a carpenter for over 36 years. I've done a lot of finish work.     It's great to see younger people continue with sure Quality work .         Thumbs up to everyone  !!!!
Beautiful work! Love it!
I’ll miss Rowan’s wit and Zeal’s zeal.  Wishing Fair winds and following seas to both!
George will be doing a Bung up job" on the wonderful 112-year-old deck boards.  I foresee these being used in the cockpit and cabins.  Plain once Sniff twice, love fresh wood...    ^~^
Definitely agree  Those cover boards are first class craftsmanship. Well done
Oh my!
Looking good 👍
This is an absolute Boat Porn.  Those lines are so darn perfect.  what a pleasure to watch
Those covering boards are beautiful, a work of art!
The talent all gathered together in one shop is awe inspiring
After all this is over, who will own the boat?
You are all amazing artists! I believed myself an accomplished woodworker until I watched the detail involved in your production. Cheers to all of you…
ROOOWWWAAANNNNNN
I had no idea B-Real was into boatbuilding 😂
bloody good job
Looks great ---- Cheers !  👍
I hope that somewhere in the ship is a bronze plaque with the names engraved of all the builders and helpers
Artists - in wood!
...
Amazing thank you Leo great artistic work…🦋🕊
Leo, your hand for curating just the finest humans for your projekt is another thing that makes it.  My hat is pulled!
Incredible workmanship. My hats off to you guys!! She is looking beautiful!
Sooooooo satisfying!! She's looking good and the contrast of the teak and decking boards just pops out loud. Loving it!
John Steinbeck would love this build.
awesome stuff,  Leo, your production value is amazing . Loved the music, wonderful camera angles and photography , your  CRUSHIN it bro ! 👍😉❤
Amazing work, which is quite beautiful....Well done ALL!
Leo if you had to sell her name the $$$$$$$$$$$$$
Awesome joinery!!! You guys are the best
So satisfying watching such skill ..... and the results are amazing. Well done all.
Always love watching the build  your video/editing and the attention to detail on this build is as you said Phenomenal 👍
The work on those covering boards is simply fantastic
WOW!  FASCINATING work!  ...and a good choice of music too!  All I need is an adult beverage (or several)!   :D
Highlight of my week. Brilliant project, beautifully put together. Well done Leo.
Amazing talent you’ve managed to attract to work on this project Leo , those cover board’s were incredible work by the team
Don't ever play 3D chess with a joiner!
ABSOLUTELY KILLER CRAFTSMANSHIP. PETE HAS SERIOUS TALENT, U BLOW ME AWAY. HIGHLY TALENTED SHIPWRIGHTS‼️‼️. Vinny 🇺🇸
Just WOW, the talent, workmanship and the videography speaks volume's to the whole project, Talley Ho couldn't have found a better custodian than Leo to bring her back to life, best wishes to you all 👍
There is no way Tally Ho was ever built to this precision before.  It's turning out awesome!
Amazing skills from Pete and Zeal ,great too watch and too see this beautiful boat being made whole again
Where does that beautiful  clear teak cover board material come from?
Leo it's cool how such amazing ppl have come along to get involved with Tally Ho and you on this massive journey.  PLEASE let Pete know that I'm one of MANY MANY viewers who love him being there with you. Idk why, cuz I don't know you guys, but I just feel in my gut you two have become and will remain close  buds. Not to mention,  Patrick....OH MY LORD I love all " Tbe Patrick " you wanna share. So many other fantastic ppl since day 1, but boy I have a real soft spot for Pete and Patrick.  I think you do too.....
*- [ Pete and Zeal ] "Master Carpenters"...yes. Proper SHIP WRIGHTS, Yes ! ! ! **25:06*  *- As a long ago construction site Carpenter's Union Steward in Massachusetts, I well up inside seeing them work their craft, hearing their deft and highly intelligent communication skills to teach, and quietly model leadership.*
Stunning work!
Leoooo, subtitles pleaseee !!!  Greetings from Cangas-Galicia-Spain
Leo, what can one say....Master Craftsmen at work. Such finesse and complicity made to look like magic. Great team of guys pooling their skills. Excellent episode.
Leo you are soooo lucky to have such gifted craftsmen and women helping you bring Tally Ho back to life.  Another stellar video. 🇨🇦
no farewell clip from Rowan? bummer, he's been a steadfast part of this pandemic crew and then some. all the best, Rowan!
Built like a boat in the Swiss navy
How many hours did it take from start of pattern to finished one plank board.
Damn fine work!
Great episode and tally ho is progressing at a high rate of knots! Enjoyed seeing the different methods Pete and Ziel used to cut the covering boards, very skilled craftsmen.
Awesome
Beautiful workmanship! A joy to watch. Thank you Pete and Zeal.
What are you doing Pete?
Those covering board fits are insane!! So impressive. Well done fellas!
Have to say cover boards are one of my most favourite bits I love looking at how they join very beautiful love your work
Outstanding workmanship in every regard. As a former log cabin builder, finish carpenter and custom dogsled builder I know it when I see it. As an aside Zeal is going to Bristol Bay and the arrow on the map points to Norton Sound where in 1979 I tagged salmon for Alaska Department of Fish and Game. Ah, memories.
I have a sneaky feeling that teak cost as much as Tally Ho did to build.
Contrast between deck planking and teak cover boards looks amazing!!! Really highlights the skill in fitting such complex angles. Respect! Thanks for throwing in the shots from around the boatyard. Sea Dream - very nice boat.
Great craftsmanship by Pete and Zeal.
The difference between Art and a Boat is that a Boat floats.
Lovely work in lovely wood.
Man, i would love to pick through your scrap pile!
Very nice video thanks for sharing.  :o)
Thanks Zeal and Rowan, hope you built some memories (and signed the boat somewhere), welcome George! I’m soooo happy to see some of the original wood being used in that way.
That is gorgeous
Sometimes it just seems, building a boat is not wood working - it is sculpting with wood.
I don't think anyone could have imagined the magnitude of work work that has gone into this project, and to such a high level of craftsmanship. Well done Leo and all the team members along the way.
Master shipwrights and a beautifully shaped boat. Doesn’t get better.
Another fantastic episode - great to see the crew back again and the awesome work they all do. Thanks Leo!
Great work!
When I see how precisely Pete and Zeal fit those boards, I could cry.

Great job Pete!
nice to see some more original wood made ready.
With every single cut with the saw in this precious and rare wood, I would have a heart rate of 200! This boat is too good for the dangerous sea. This boat would have the makings of a World Heritage Site (to my mind)! You are artists!!!
MAKE SURE  TO HIT THE LIKE BUTTON EVERY TIME YOU WATCH LEO'S VIDEO'S !   it helps the channel  also check out his wish list - hopefully you can purchase a thing or two to help build Tally Ho
Onde está a Arara
hope there's a opportunities to leave at least some of the wonderful craftsmanship and unique details of Tally Ho visible behind the ceiling planks (and elsewhere) to marvel at in the future!?. The teak is beautiful, an amazing respectful fit and effort by Pete and Zeal!
You guys are almost dead even with Acorn to Arabella right now. If you had to guess, who do you think will launch first?
Lovely vid.....the competition was fierce...good work comes from that.
Amazing woodwork!
*- "Dot all your lower case j's." **3:22* *- [ And with that, may I once again raise a toast to Mirthful Irreverence, everywhere ! ! ! ]*
Leo & Crew have once again, to nobody's surprise fitted another  Part on their masterpiece a k.a As Tally Ho. WELL DONE 👍
Excellent travail les gars . Belle progression 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻🍾🍾🍾🍾🍾De France
Wow, it looks amazing! That team is amazing!
Movin' along nicely.. Just might meet that 2 year timeline.   Har Har Har       :-)
Nice to see you back again guys, cheers
The hull is a huge cabinet-maker level project...
I love the attention to detail and the accuracy of all the Tally Ho work. A pleasure to watch 👍
It is kind of ironic that my wife is sat watching a bunch of f-wits who can't tie bamboo poles together to make a raft (some new reality program called the bridge) totally annoying. Here I am enthralled watching the most talented guys rebuilt a classic boat. I'm not saying I'm any better as we are both just watching programs but it just goes to show the popularity of watching hopeless f-wits. Maybe people like to feel superior to the f-wits but I would rather have respect for you guys. Amazing work, things are really taking shape now.
Tje craftsmanship is really something else!
I wonder where those beautiful teak boards came from. The short ends seem to have been carved for a previous job, possibly a very expensive floor?
Amazing video as usual. Love to see the team back at it.
This is the kind of work that warms the hearts of longtime fans of this channel.  This is boat building by guys who really know what they're doing.  It is very satisfying to see this fine craftsmanship accomplished before our very eyes.  Thanks Leo.  This really is one of the premiere channels on YouTube for anyone who loves to seeing things being built with bare hands.
Leo how much per foot did that teak run you? I just got 2x6 ipe it was 15 a foot I can't imagine what that teak cost in those sizes
It takes a lot of energy to shape one piece of wood, so this boat will be full of positive energy and I’m sure that she will ‘sing’ whilst sailing...
.
That thing is a masterpiece of craftmanship. And unlike a piece of furniture that sits still it will get to sail ! Congrats for the channel and thanks for sharing.
Hi, Den here.  What a lovely episode. Thanks.
Hey Leo, can you send me some scrap wood so i can make something for you guy's..as a present for all the years you give me pleasure watching this epic project.
The choice of music is what really sets this channel apart from all others
I have watched every episode and I must say I’ve enjoyed all of them. Thank you guys.
Leo and crew, I've been watching for YEARS NOW! Have not missed an episode. This project should be required for all middle schoolers as a testimony to a dream, a team and hard/skilled work can create Magnificents!!!! Bravo!
Im from Wi..Appleton to be exact..where is George from ?  if he doesn't mind saying..never miss an episode.. love the channel..
Fantastic upload Leo and of course wonderful workmanship from your crew.
Media studies LOL.  What did you study there bud???   Hu???    We have our eyes on you there.
Get video best line was Pete “you know what they say..wood don’t grow on trees you know” 😀😁
sprung beech slats far better for beds. They do actually act as springs
Question: In the original version of this boat, would the craftsmen and women have put this much craftsmanship into the boat? Or, would it have been a somewhat looser fit all around and gap filler and the like?
I remember that first episode I watched when Leo was all alone and pulling out keel bolts. Now he's got an ever changing  cast of interesting characters, and even a change of scenery. This channel never disappoints.
Cool seeing a Thunderbird! Put two wooden ones over 45 years in the water this week for the season!  Excellent video as always!
I wonder what Pete's doing...
Pure skill and craftsmanship.
Anyone know what kind of hand plane Pete's using @24:16 ?
pretty briiliant :-)
Great episode , as usual. Coinsidentaly i'm fitting covering boards to my 26ft 1923  A Mylne designed Clyde Day Sailer. Well done Leo, you inspire me to keep going on my project,
Thanks Guys
There is a phot bomber around 20:45.  Can you find it?  LOL
Yeah as I was watching and Peat started cutting the teak, I noticed something wet and thought maybe I sat down on some water. I looked and nope. Turned out it was my wallet crying. great job fellas.
Basil: (pointing to the lovely view) "That is Torquay, Madam."   Mrs Richards: "It's not good enough!"   Basil: "May I ask what you were expecting to see out of a Torquay hotel bedroom window? Sydney Opera House, perhaps? the Hanging Gardens of Babylon? Herds of wildebeest sweeping majestically past?..."   Mrs Richards: "Don't be silly! I expect to be able to see the sea!"  Basil: "You can see the sea, it's over there between the land and the sky."   Mrs Richards: "I'm not satisfied. But I shall stay. But I expect a reduction."   Basil: "Why?! Because Krakatoa's not erupting at the moment?"
What skilled craftsmen.
Looking forward to the King planks installation. The deck looks fabulous. Well done everyone.
Nice to see this beautiful work!
I have been following the series for a while and have loved it. My wife lovingly refers to Leo as "Noah". I was wondering, have you considered selling small, signed offcuts as an additional way to support the build? I would pay $25 - $50 + shipping to get a small piece of say the teak from an offcut signed by the crew, and I imagine others would be interested in a physical piece of the project as well? I know logistics on something like that may not be feasible, but just a thought I had as you were talking about not wasting any of the wood.
Teak is a wonderful wood! I've just made a tiny wee heads shelf tidy from a piece of timber from an old lighthouse service vessel, Fingal - now a luxury hotel in Leith Edinburgh.
I have a question how many fasteners would you say has been used on tally ho as well as how often do you have to sharpen your tools?
Looks lovely. All these jobs make a lot of work together! I am happy that you still maintain quality even now the finishing of the boat is in sight!
It’s truly soul pleasing to see the results of Pete and Zeal’s efforts.  It’s so nice when things are done properly and fit as we imagine (the plan) in our minds.
That clip where Pete's head went crazy while he was cutting was great.
Very impressive work gentlemen.
great scraftsmanship. great episode
Love the intro music . This is the one I’ve been waiting on .
Awesome work guys. The way you all bring precious pieces of wood to life is truly amazing. Excellent teamwork.
I so enjoy these videos Leo.  I'm very impressed with the skill and craftsmanship of you and your team!  Truly impressive!
As a woodworker I just wanted to say that is fantastic stunning work. Very very skilled. I very much enjoyed watching that done.
25:41 Those angles, particularly the perpendicular seam, look a little suspect. Are they fixed in post production after the final trim? I see lots of stanchion wrestling.
It's looking so good!
I bet that boat is getting heavy 😅
It better bl***y float. So much craftsmanship
It better bl***y float. So much craftsmanship
The combination of the teak against the Alaskan ceder is stunning. Both Pete and Zeal showed excellent craftsmanship and artistry.
Who else laughed out loud at the "I like the cut of your jib, Pete" comment?
Enjoy watching latest video working on Tally Ho wooden sailboat ⛵️! 😘⛵️😀 Mike from Missouri
Always thinking of the legal aspect.  Who owns this. What rights do all helper's, supporters have, and why are this subject never touched. ? 🤔
Beautiful wood, beautifully fitted. Nice work, guys.
We miss Rowan. He was such a workforce!
What's to say but .. magnificent! Such class, such skill, both function and form .. such beauty with no one left out .. great project and superb leadership. Can't wait for another in the epic!
Thanks Leo & guy's....Shoe🇺🇸
What’s up with Pancho? 🦜
I am somewhat familiar with carpentry, where even the most complex finish woodworking projects (stairs, banisters, cabinets) are square, plumb, straight, and level.   To see the complex requirements for a shipwright, where none of these descriptors apply, is fantastic.  Kudos to you all.  (GREAT VIDEO!) BTW, given the well-documented price of construction materials these days, what does an 8 or 9-quarter, clear teak, 10-in x 10-foot board cost these days??  (Or MYOB!)
The master of covering boards, he is a a god with golden hands! I also build boats, smaller, and I know some thing about perfektion. Mann, oh Mann, wird das ein schönes Schiff!!
Thanks Pete, I will from now on talk of crossing my t's and dotting my lower-case j's :)
Amazing work!
Awesome video
Awesome workmanship!!!. Love the videos and the music choices. Greetings from Hungary!.
Thank you for your videos!
Hell of a lot of real craftsmen in this biblical voyage following from the start just love it thank you leo
it is called a gauge rod lol
Whooooooo....she's looking fine............
You guys do realize I hope that if some of us don't get our regular Sampson Boat Company fix we get a little hinky
Rats Leo.. you could have let that opening song go for awhile.. You always have a great taste in music.. Leo, you make me want to move back to the coast.. back the the ship yards and people that live there.. I find that I miss it more when watching your videos.. But at 70 and broken now I just can't get around and can't take the weather like I did in my youth.. Thanks for wandering around and bringing back some good memories of the days when I used to be able to work and enjoy the coast. It's just some days I find it hard to be old.. No longer a member of society.. Just an old man stuck mostly at home.. But anyway.. carry on my brother.. enjoy this project.. even that hard times.. because they will be gone soon enough.. Say hey to the gang maybe I can make it up there this summer.. We will see.. Carry on!
Such skills! 👏👏👏👏
Looked like the "Sea Dream" was missing a part of its keel.
Like everything else on the boat those cover boards are works of art
how much for one piece of the cover boards???
Pete is the man, no doubt.
Always lovely seeing a new TallyHo video!  Almost as nice as driving through the boatyard and finding the door up so I can see her in the flesh.  Err, wood. Great to see the old wood is going to be reused.  And how appropriate that it's being run through a vintage thicknesser. Acorn 2 Arabella was also doing covering boards this week.  As usual, completely different from TallyHo's.
It floors me every time I see you guys fit a component in with such precision. Recently worked on a wall panel frame to bed a stained glass project in at the top of the stairs to my art studio. After all the planning and measuring, building the glass on a pattern… I still needed to rout an additional amount of room in the frame for the one glass piece. You guy make it look easy.  What product would a boat builder use in older times before plywood was available to make those incredibly complex patterns? I can’t imagine even very heavy paper would work well.
Staunchions or 'Stanchions'.    who can explain ??
I'm from Wisconsin... Is that what my accent sounds like?  Oh no!
The woodworking skills shown here are incredible in many ways as usual. The quality of the finish and detail, the patience required but importantly completed by many generations of craftsmen. If anyone says that youngsters don't have the highly skilled abilities to deliver this quality of work, watch this channel. Well done you are a credit to yourselves and the project.
What do you do with all the tiny scraps that you could never reuse? You could contract with a model kit maker and sell scaled-down versions of the Tally Ho to raise money for the project using pieces of the real thing!
"...and dot all your lower-case js." LOVE it!
I hope I get the name right; "No Feet Pete",  Has come a very long way in the manner in which he presents himself to the camera.  I am proud of him.
How nice to find this new post for us Leo. I think I have now visited every post from the beginning . The joinery is as ever perfection and sooooo pleasing to ones eyes. Too bad about covering all the interior hiding all the wonderful work below decks but understandably a must. Oh my, Leo and crew, she is showing her elegance more and more with these posts now. Too bad the posts seem to last only a few moments. I will visit it again to ensure I haven't missed a moment. Thanks again from North Western Canada. Onward eh !
An interesting number when this boat is all done is what you would have to sell it for to make a profit if all the hours were done by paid tradesmen .   Give us an idea what a vessel of this kind was worth in its day
Beautiful addition!
I shudder to think how much those slabs of Teak cost!
25:48 What a shot!
Beautiful!
covering boards look absolutely fabulous great job lads 👍
12:06. Pete lost his lucky coin.
Epic skills and pure quality.
I would be interested in knowing the timeline of just one section of the coverboard. How long to pattern. mark the Teak , cut , and trim and final fit. These fine craftsperson's are patient and meticulous beyond belief! What will they think in a 100 years?
Really great work ! Well done Pete and Zeal
Glad you had your well earned and probably needed break, ya all been slamming it out for a long time, and the meticulous details can get to a guy.  Good to recharge, relax, and refresh now and then 👍🏼❤️
Lower case Js will forever have a new meaning for me..🤣, and it’s fun to watch Pete act surprised when part actually fit🤷
With all the crazy in the world, Watching video's like this is like therapy !!!!!
Fantastic carpentry! Anyone know what you call that special plane that Pete is using to get right into the corners, at 24.20?
The original wood looks super. It must have popped when it was all laid. I can see it reappearing each video. Great to see mate.
RESPECT FOR TE PRESISION OF THE TIMBERWORK... AMAZING CRAFTSMANSHIP!
making great progress. who is going to do your electrical engineering?
Nice.
Brilliant. Pete in top form, clean shaven and clean/new clothes even ?! Welcome back Richard.
Never trust a man or boy who is afraid to get his hands dirty.
Tally Ho and her crew do more emotional good for us than they know. Thanks again all!
Wow! Such a tremendous amount of expertise went into making those cover boards and as you say Leo, there is still a lot left to do. Pete and Zeal are clearly very refined crafts people. It takes a lot of focus and patience to cut something like this so accurately. Amazing!
Puzzle piece Masters! Well done very nice work!
Beautiful!
U are all fenomenal.... a great icebear hugg from Sweden
maybe you are on time to finish your boat before SHTF, that we are heading now
It is so relaxing to watch you craftsmen fitting and fettling to achieve a better than original  result.   Thank you so much guys for all your efforts in reviving Tally Ho.  What a team!
Now with some time behind you, how are you feeling about getting kicked out of the last yard? I imagine still annoyed to lose a home you put so much work into, but at the same time it feels like working in the shipyard has been easier in some ways and provides a lot of engaging diversions in the down time.
The guys skill level is EPIC. The teak is beautiful. It just does not get any better. Bravo to all hands. 👏
Wow!!!! Fan Sweden 🇸🇪
One of the best videos. For one thing, both shipwrights featured are flat-out slick. It is interesting that they use slightly different methods. When the board fits so perfectly, it is a pleasure to see. Glad to see that people like the cut of Pete's jib, and that Z. is going to get some quality fishing done. Best regards to some of the best craftsmen on this fine planet of ours.
Leo, someday do a interview with the crew talking about how they like to work... With music, always with a plan or not and things like that :)
Impressive work guys. Nice Jibs, one and all!
Hi Pete your presentation is more than good enough for when no if you start your own channel but do not leave this channel till the boat is finished maybe start some some projects alongside this one maybe a skiff for Tally Ho I for one will subscribe regards from Liverpool England.
Phenomenal.
Impressive as always.
A very interesting episode!
Phenomenal work!
Those teak cover boards look awesome!
Thanks Leo and guys 👍👏👏👏👏👌🇬🇧
Pure artistry!
Awesome
That deck is beautiful.  I've been waiting to see it.
Hi Leo. What about masts, rigging and sails. That time is approaching. GREAT JOB!!!!
"Wood don't grow on trees!"😄
Hej  det er meget flot det i laver  Håber at i får god vind Hilsen fra Danmark 😀😀👍👍👍
😮😮😮😮😮😮😮👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍Pete is os cool
The accuracy of those cover boards absolutely blows my mind. They did amazing.
I’d love to understand how you cut the bevels in the Staunchion through holes in two directions.
Лодка будет золотая
This is truly an amazing experience to be watching this series and seeing the beauty of Tally ho.
I am surprised you are not using some sort of tambour for the bunks,  I would have thought having the option for both storage and bed would have been more useful.
If stanchions are not perpendicural to the cover boards, or straight, how did they cut the holes for them? Or mark the holes?
Beautiful job on the cover boards. I never thought about compound angles for the stanchion post holes. That must take a bit of figuring.
Amazing video! Well produced, the making of the cover boards didn't leave me wanting, very nice!
Watching Pete and the others has taught me how little patience I have. Lol. Seeing them fit those boards with such accuracy is amazing and I know I don't have the attention to detail these craftsman do. Beautiful work folks.
Sorry to see Rowan gone will miss his humorous approach to life. Pete and Zeal did a great job  on the cover boards.
What a ton of labor intensive work...amazing, but it looks beautiful.
@15:13 to 18:02  "our extensive break" montage with Pete is awesome.
One word. Awesome!
That's so clean, looks amazing.
Shit Pete that’s pretty Those covering boards and the deck is gonna be striking!
So good to finally see some of the old Tallyho get put back to use.
Voor een Engelsman best goed werk.
Look at the size of that Teak plank. It must cost an absolute fortune. Sad to see such a lovely bit of wood being cut up, particularly since it is so rare. Great job Pete.
Those covering boards are pieces if art!
Some awesome shipwrights on view. Stunning.
Amazing work.
Amazing work as always! As a guy who appreciates VERY sharp tools, I watch all the hand tool work and can't help but think of how many sharpening hours have taken place during this project.
Always a joy to watch Leo and his team working on Tally Ho, I really hope when he brings her home to the UK that I can get to see her in the flesh.
18.00.  Snap out of it Pete.
Which brand is the sailing boat being lifted out of the water at 17'18" ? She is beautiful.
Sounds like you are saying staunchions as opposed to stanchions, Leo. Is that an American thing?
Great video. The devil is in the details.
Just WOW! It's coming together like a marvel
Sorry to ask such a superficial question, but what would you guys value tally ho at? Apart from emotional value of course! Thanks!
It's lapses in concentration that cause people to make mistakes. One needs to be able to concentrate and I think some of the young newbies on the project need to respect that and stop talking to Steve and the others who are doing critical tasks that require concentration. I realize they want to make everything a social event for themselves, but it's about getting the job done and doing it right with minimal errors. Some self control which I can understand that they may not have learned at home needs to come into play.. There's a time for letting people work, and there is a time for socializing. Learn the difference.
Beautiful! Great work fellars! Can't wait to see her float someday!
Like. A. Glove. <3
The most satisfying video yet Leo..KUDOS
This boat is going to a work of craftman art when complete.  Amazing work, guys.
Great Pete ! <3
Great video as always, such a beauty  ! Was thinking, could you do a video (or part of it) summarizing the tools that were available/used when Tally Ho was first build ? And if possible, the time it took, number of people, rough number of hours compared to this second time ? (and was it not too many people/long time or more quite a lot of people shorter time ?)
Impressive craftsmanship! A pleasure to see you professionals working.
I'd love to know if there is any rivalry between the craftsmen at any time? It seems to be a wonderful work environment, but there must be frictions sometimes. I'm not detracting from anyone, but I do wonder.
Need a metal detector for that old lumber
really impressive work on the cover boards
I get a similar reaction when seeing those finished cover boards juxtaposed with that clean deck as when I see photos of my grandkids. I love your new guy's appreciation for that old wood as well.
So the covering board has to be completely cut out and put in place before you can check the fit? No chances to adjust or compensate. Wow, and this is done on perhaps the most expensive single piece of wood on Tally Ho.
Awesome work Leo and all the team. Been watching for a long time now.
That was nice to see in one video, lots of work!
Loved Petes Wayne’s World “lower case j’s” comment
Pete would be a darn good looking man if he took that rivet out of his nose! 😏
Wow the deck looks gorgeous! Interior work too!
Patrick never fails to make laugh.
Just stunning Leo, the work that went into those cover boards, gotta tell ya , that Pete is so impressive with his woodworking skills, cut measure, cut measure, and that piece dropped in like a jig saw puzzle, first try, incredible work. I cannot believe those squares were chiseled by hand. the deck looks beautiful, just love watching such outstanding craftsmen at work, the making of the templates and all, truly impressive, I am always in awe watching, what a team you have working on this project, yourself as well of course, all the best to ya all, watching from U.S.A. in Michigan.
Can I have the scraps?
👍✊🙏
Great to see the bunch back on site with Tally Ho. Both Pete and Zeal's  craftsmanship is once again approaching the "boat porn" level!! Absolutely awesome getting the complex cuts to look so good!! I'm sure George will be a valuable addition to Leo's crew of craftsmen. Great stuff all round.
Truly meticulous craftsmanship resulting in another beautiful piece of this handsome vessel.
Always get happy when I see you have a new video.  The cover boards are beautiful.  Always sorry to see one of your crew leave and hope they will be back.  I imagine it is hard to find a replacement with the qualitative skills that your whole team have.
An incredible amount of work hats off to all who have worked on this.  Charles
Another fantastic video Leo & Crew! As a woodworker, I can really appreciate the work that went into fitting those covering boards! BTW Leo, I really like your choice of background music for these videos! If anyone watching these videos has not contributed to the cause, I would urge you to do so! Thanks! 👍👍😉😉
me: im investing for the future everyone: Gold? Me: nah something that cost more... WOOD
Absolutely love this channel and the excellent quality of  work being performed. Continued success to you all and your endeavors!
⛵⛵⛵⛵⛵
Brilliant spectacular craftsmanship!!
Nowadays you're making serious progression.
Should make key rings with pieces of the scrap teak and sell them
Great work from everyone.  But Pete is definitely the man. Love the way he smiles when people try to give him a little  ribbing.  You guys make a great crew.
The boat is really looking good, and the video quality really stands out, are the covering boards going to stay like that at bow tip?
I admire the skills of the craftsmen who've built this work of art.
Beautiful!!!
Another fantastic episode! It's awe inspiring to watch you and the crew of master craftsmen at work shaping raw materials into a thing of such beauty and utility; just amazing. I love this project and usually watch each episode at least twice! Cheers!
Amazing video. I love this watching this sort of woodwork being undertaken
Dr. Pete and Capt. Leo  , Tally Ho.   It seems like for ever from watching the last show.
One has to appreciate a tool mostly recognized for arts and crafts projects a hot glue gun can make such a complex patterning job light work for a highly skilled tradesmen. Bravo guys
more top notch work from the crew. she really is becoming a work of art. the ship is looking good
I can see why you went to see Luke Powel who I think is a wonderful shipwright and can give a lot of advice and long may he reign.
Incredible workmanship.
Pete is my Spirit Animal. Love the videos. Especially the ones with Pete. The rest of the guys are great too!
Amazed at the precision that the team achieves in wood.
Hey Pete, whatcha doing? 👍👍🎉🎉🎉🎉🤘🏻🤘🏻
Even if I didn't like boat rebuilding, I would listen to your channel for the cool music.
Covering Boards, to say the least, are absolutely beautiful. I wouldn't know where to begin. Very impressive.
All very talented young men.  No way could I have cut those multi angled timbers.  Many thanks for your content. Uk based.
Beautiful precision work! Glad to see the whole crew back.
"What are you just lying down?" haha
I hope that you're selling those scrap pieces of teak - eBay.  A lot could be used for trim and make great lawn furniture.
Cutting that teak is an act of unadulterated bravery. (1) it costs a fortune (2) a replacement plank would always look like a bad match.
It would be interesting if you could show a rather large error in the construction (if any) and how you rectify.  Are there times when the wood piece is to be scraped or are there "work arounds"?  As good as your craftsmen are, nobody is perfect!
Stanchion or staunchion? I've always said stanchion,is it a difference in dialect?
Susan & Tony here, that is some beautiful joinery , on some EXPENSIVE wood material.
Crazy! Building a ship is like crafting an ornate piece of furniture. Maybe is why there is a ship in craftsmanship.
What did the old timers use for patterns and templates before Lauan door skins, hot melt and CA glues? My guess is cardbox and sealing wax.
I’ll be happy to take the teak offcuts - for knifemaking at our local scouts-division.  They seem to be somewhat of a handle-size.
Beautiful!! (I can get rid of those scraps for you. :)
Great video!
I never stop being impressed.
A worthy use for teak. I saw this rare and precious timber used for planters! at Brighton Marina - a total waste simply because someone had thought 'marine environment = teak'.
Fantastic craftsmanship.  Perhaps you could do a video of what it was like doing such work with the tools available when she was first built.  Thanks and Cheers.
Great progress, still my favorite YouTube.
Leo, if you want some good background music...try "Walking Man Blues" by Roy Rogers
thank you
Beautiful work!
This is going to be such a beautiful boat when finished. Excellent work being performed on her. Top notch builders here.
Looking better and better all the time. Keep up the great craftsmanship.
I looked up staunchion and the spelling was corrected to stanchion. I suspect this is the difference between British and American spelling/pronunciation.
Great to see you all back and having fun!  cheers....rr Normandy, Fra.
And I worry about cutting kitchen worktops!
Hi Leo. Did you ever say anything about the estimated cost to build Tally Ho and the approximate moneytary value of the completed project?
⭐🙂👍
There is a point where mere craftsmanship transcends beyond artisanal ability and becomes pure artistry.  Pete and Zeal smash it out of the park! An absolute pleasure to watch ! BZ lads!
Pete you are the MAN!
A piece of art
A joy to watch Pete at work. Teak is an unforgiving material but looks beautiful when finishes. Love to hear more on how the guys work so carefully with hand chisels, something I’ve never been able to master!
Craftmanship at it's finest! With all the patrons, volunteers and trade folks who have laid a hand to her making, there is going to be one heck of a launch party!
great video, Tally Ho is looking great!!
I've learnt a lot from this channel and some of it has been about ship building.
Beautiful pieces of teak. Great craftsmanship. I am envious.
Rowen we miss you already!!!
The amount of detail Pete pays attention to blows my mind! & that deck is looking amazing!
i am in awe of the craftsmanship that is going into tally ho , just superb,its going to be a fully functional work of art  i just love seeing it come together , so much work leo mad respect
Great example of capturing videos over months to explain the process of completing the work.
phenomenal video! i'm a bit sad though because i can see the end in sight. (crying)
Checking out the awesome poochies.
Coming along very nice Team!!!
wonderful workmanship i enjoyed this video
Subtítulos en español por favor!!! Jejej
Right on Pete... my favorite shipwright.
Isn't it amazing that no man-made material can match the characteristics of teak.
9ft of 2" thick teak - no pressure then
I love using sticks to make difficult measurements. Seeing the pipe clamps made me think of something I have discovered; using unions to join two pipes together when I need a longer clamp - it works well for me - and when a short clamp is needed it's easy to undo if I keep the threads oiled. Makes storage easier for us garage geniuses... LOL
Just doing some rough math to put into perspective how expensive those cover boards likely are....  If I'm not mistaken, Tally-Ho is about 48 feet long. The boards are 2" thick by approximately 16" wide, (which is a guess).  Through my business i can buy 2x teak from a wholesaler for around $80/bdft, although I cannot get lumber nearly as wide as Leo has here- so the real cost could be substantially more.  Therefore, conservatively.... 2"x16"x48' (x2) = 256 board feet x $80/bdft = $20,480!!!  Great video as always, Leo- and top shelf craftsmanship to Pete and Zeal! You guys never disappoint. Thank you!
Thank you for the close up of the pattern making process around the stanchions, and Pete, and the section drawing as this is an impossible process to just verbalize. With the level of craftsmanship being highlighted it really shows why perfection takes time and a very large collection of extremely qualified craftsmen.
The guys are doing an amazing job, especially the covering boards, they're a work of art, sweeeet
I’d be terrified to cut that teak. Big $!!!
Beautiful work.
Good to see you back, thank you for sharing this project with all of us Leo.    Cheers
Master Craftsmen of the First Order! I had always heard stories about Teak, it's nuances, quirks and qualities...amazing to watch...
I wish i could travel into the future to see the finish product. I can tell is gonna be awesome. The LOVE that goes into this build is amazing.  Great work guys. <3
Precision work for sure.
Absolutely masterful! Those are some very tricky compound cuts to get all of the stanchions to fit properly, but as always, the end result looks outstanding. I'm so grateful there are such committed and talented torch bearers bringing these skills with us in the current generation. May you all thoroughly enjoy the fruit of your labors and be abundantly blessed in them! And as always, thanks for teaching, documenting and sharing it with us spectators and wannabes! Cheers!
Richard is right. I learned from a 60 year old carpenter who scribed almost everything. Perfect fits, twice to 10 times faster as our short term memories wane,
Any details on what will be used for the mast, boom, sails, and rigging?
This has to be the luckiest boat ever.
Teak also has a ton of silica so it dulls your tools as you work.
very impressive work...
Measurement is the enemy of precision.  Use a story stick instead.  The oldest guy in the shop knows how to work the smartest.
Not a sailor, and compared to you guys not even a woodworker but I love watching you guys build this stuff.
Hi George! I am Jeff from Wisconsin but now live in Washington State. Welcome to the crew!
Yet another beautiful installment, Leo and crew! Makes my weekend
Great craftsmanship! Well done.
This is going to be such an amazing boat!  The craftsmanship and attention to detail top notch.
As usual I'm blown away by the level of craftmanship on the rebuild. She is starting to look the part again, a gorgeous boat rebuild by fantastic people!
Would it be possible to use the old original teak planks to finnish the bulwalk planking so it woulkd be all teak from the cover boards up ? You could then varnish them to stand out like the transon against the painted hull.I'm sure there would be enough recoverable planks of sufficient length to do this.Just a thought.
Better filming than Discovery ever one. And real professional and interesting story line.
Leo has really put together the golden team in this restoration project. Aces all around.
Ждём с нетерпением, когда он поплывёт рассекая волны!!!
I’m often blown away by the attention to detail and the skills of your team Leo, such a dedicated crew… keep up the great job 👍
Beautiful work. Thank you.
Loved the guys touching and smelling the freshly planed old planks.
4:50 Couldn't you use a jigsaw for that? Seems a lot less fiddly than swapping between circular saw and pull saw. Are jigsaw blades long enough?
Beautiful!
Boat building has all the precision of fine cabinetry making on a house-sized scale. Phew.
Respect…
Love watching skilled craftsmen (and women) at work.  The fact that many of the Shipwrights are young guys & gals makes it even more impressive.  Most youngsters nowadays struggle changing a flat tire but not these guys & gals, they definitely have the “we can do anything” attitude.
Magnifique !
Stay safe.
Beautiful wood work!  Such fits brings tears to my eyes.  I've fitted covering boards and king planks so I know what's involved. Pretty work!
Just beautiful work!  Guitar background was very nice!!!
What's ur plan with the drug addicts you hired after the boat is finished???  Cheap help never ends well. You'll get what you paid for dude.  Go watch the news and be sick, because they told you to be.
Is Tally Ho about as far in being rebuild (in terms of the pieces being fitted/present) as when you first met her sitting tarped up ?
hola pete...esta quedando impresionante ....los felicito aunque ya perdí la cuenta del tiempo que paso desde que iniciaron esta resurrección....desde Argentina un abrazo a todos
Great to see Pete and Zeal doing that Burmese teak justice. If ever there was a case of measure twice and cut once...this was it. Very impressive...well done guys.
_I like the cut o' yer jib, Pete._  Ba-dish...
I love seeing ol-timers work. Years of experience and lots of mistakes. Leading to one conclusion. A stick is better than any unit of measurement.
Leo, on that first day on Tally Ho could you have possibly dreamed her rebirth would be achieved to such perfection? Even her original pieces are being reborn. Breathtaking stuff. Thanks.
I would like to know how the guys measured and cut  the angle of the stanchion through the coverboard. That was the only thing missing in the coverboard explanation, and I think it's a technique I'd like to learn.
Every video just gets better! Watching some mighty fine woodworking!⛵️⛵️⛵️🙏🏼
Gone Fishing! 😂😂
That's some impressive fit up
You could do a limited run on a merch site. Sell bits of teak branded with your logo. I think the community would like to own a piece of tally ho.
Ta Leo
Awesome complicated wood work! Truly awesome work and probably the most intricate yet.
Yay, Pete’s back. Great to see you Pete
19:59 did you see that ? He took the pointy bit off the end of the off cut... good man...very considerate of him...
so after this is done, can we do another one? what will they do with the sailboat anyways, i dunno if i have seen a "the plan for this boat when it's finished" type of thing, is it a working boat, or just a fun boat? i wish i could learn how to sail, but i dont have the social skills or money to get lessons
This vessel is a work of art. I bet the original was not made as well as this version.  This time in its history, the men and women who built it are forever immortalized. As is should be.
This episode was a bit special. I finally managed to catch a  premiere, and, what a pleasure it was to watch as well. Craftmanship oozing from every board, saw, and chisel. What a wonderful way to spend a late Saturday afternoon. Thanks Guys. :)
Such craftsmanship!  Well done.
Measuring sticks, as shown @16:00 are super old-school. I know some old timers who swear they're faster and more accurate than using anything with actual units marked on them.
Big fan from Tx! Y’all have mentioned several times how expensive Teakwood is. Roughly how much did the large plank cost that Pete cuts for the bow as an example?
Was curious about the caulking bevel for the cover boards. Nice job explaining it. Thank you 👍
No man will be a sailor who has contrivance enough to get himself in a jail. For being in a ship is being in a jail with the chance of being drowned. A man in a jail has more room  better food, and commonly better company. _  Dr. Samuel Johnson  London 1780.
Absolutely incredible craftsmanship. 👏👍
Another excellent video Leo, you make light work in your maticulous editing of 'offering it up', or maybe you've such skilled shipwrights it's not necessary, haha
Beautiful work 😊👍🏻👍🏻
Pete and Zeal have indeed cut some very fine looking coverboards :-)
Man-o-man, those boards must cost a fortune. What happens if you mess up the measurements and the board doesn't fit?
I am speechless now.  No one has ever said that of me.  Magic.
Wow.....what a nice piece of teak!!  Good work Pete.
pete makes it look easy
Makes my Saturday. Now I have to go find a Lee Neilsen Chisel Plane like the one Pete is using at 5:47 and 24:19. Sweet.
Watching the coverboards go in was so satisfying! The deck is beautiful as I knew it would be. Tedious work pays off big time. Great job!
Love that chisel plane Pete's using, have to get one.
Awesome videos as always. Will there be insulation added between the ceiling planks and the hull?
All those prefect gaps... so satisfying to watch. good work guys
@15:40 - Glad to see Frank Zappa make an appearance.
This guy, Pete, doesn't he ever eat? He's so thin, he could stand between rain drops.
Cutting a complex shape for the SBC on very expensive timber  with a skillsaw while your mates and the world look on,  no pressure then Pete :-)
Leo, could you give us a brief discussion about how tools have changed since the original boat was built.
Extra good one with some mad woodworking skills. Thanks!
Awesome work on the boards….
👍 very excellent work. Start with 463 people. Then, when "We're all back",  this channel was quite full with 8.2k watch what everyone was doing. Right Pete 😉
Whenthis rewtoration will be over, Tally Ho will be 'like new'. :)
Nice.
As we say in holland : that's fits like a big dick in a widow woman " 🤔
The only thing that I hate about these videos,,, is when they end! Seriously! What a great way to start the weekend!
When all is done, small offcuts from that old original wood might make fine thankyou souvenirs to the most generous supporters of this beautiful project.
She looks fantastic!
Hello from Newlyn cornwall, what a great crew you have Leo,past and present.truly a labour of love.
OMG Pete @2:38 how many times did you have to reinsert those stanchions into your template? ;)
👍
Love the work u all doo !!! Sooooo nice 2 get the wood fix.. miss working on wooden boats.. did some work on the 1980-85... here in sveeden.. folkboats and other smaller boats.
Most excellent work Pete & Zeal. Tally Ho is coming along nicely Leo. Great episode.
Thanks Leo, great job guys. The vessel is looking amazing, truly amazing. Keep up the great work and stay safe.
Is it Pancho or Poncho?
Thanks again for another excellent video Leo. Can't imagine the time that goes into filming/editing/posting all of this for the sake of bringing us along for the ride. Just know that your efforts don't go unnoticed, I speak for all the fans of this channel when I say thank you from the bottom of my heart. I look forward to every single update on Tally Ho, it has been such a fun adventure to follow!
Mercedes-Benz would be pleased with the evenness of those gaps! Precision!
For Sampson Boat Co! For Tally Ho! For the algorithm!
Amazing job! She needs 5 feet of water below her "new" keel!
Now the 2 week wait for the next video. Leo can we get weekly vids back please 😊
👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
3 huzzahs for Tally and crew!!!
Great video !
Awesome Craftsmanship fellas
Those are really some daunting pieces to cut with no stock for failure.
I liked, unliked and liked this video again also where is birb?
Happy to be a part of the crew! -George
That looks so good, glad to see my support creating something that will be sailing the seas long after I am gone, Thanks, everyone!
The workmanship of these guys amazes me each time I see a new episode. Brilliant.
Awesome!!! I unfortunately saw a video of a beautiful 3- mast getting sunk by a impact with a stuck throttle work boat…..first thought, better call Leo!
The deck boards and outer edges look awesome! Pete has really put in a pile of work - seems like he's in every single video. THANKS PETE.
Guys - its beautiful a true peice of art!
She looks amazing
JOY!! A new Sampson vid!!! Sadness .... the vid ends and the wait for the next vid begins.
Great to see Pete back in the game. A truly impressive man, and he hasn’t paid me to volunteer this endorsement. Not to forget Leo, he’s remarkable as well.
Incredible work. Measure 12 times, cut once!
"Staunchion" versus "Stanchion" (American).  I never noticed you Brits spell it different.
Bravi ragazzi 💪💪
Hellow from Germany
The arrow to  Bristol Bay is wrong, you are too far North!
The best!
Measure 5 times and cut 4 times.
Will there be any insulation between the ceiling planks and the outer boards?
You should do wood working asmr
You know before watching this series I never valued the plane, I now see how essential this tool is to any quality wood worker. Thank again Leo and crew.
Lovin' seeing her come together! The hull and now the deck! 🎉   Maybe the community will help me out, where can I get that red double pocket breast shirt of Leo's? It's no Carhartt, but I gotta know!   All the best gang!
There's a book called 1421 The Year China Discovered America by Gavin Menzee I think. In the book the author makes the case for how China probably visited the Americas before Columbus. The ships the Chinese built were 300-400 feet long and 100 feet wide and made entirely with Teakwood. One ship required 300 acres of Teak trees to construct a single ship. Marco Polo actually witnessed at least one of the fleet's passing by.
Best 3D puzzle ever.
That is a beautiful piece of wood
I totally do not mind saying, watching this process is nerve wracking, I cannot imagine actually doing the work.
Made my day :)
Best reason to wake up on Saturday mornings since Gummy Bears and Muppet Babies.
Don’t worry…teak burns just as good in the wood stove if you screw up….Hahahahha
Ahhh!   That piece of teak!  Or rather, those pieces of teak!  You could buy a pretty nice small sailboat for the price of those timbers alone!
All people around the world are overwhelmingly good people. It’s a shame that greedy and powerful deprive those good people of the best possible quality of life. Great to come here and enjoy such a great representation of the human spirit. Go Leo, your making the world a better place.
Yipee😃
finally caught a premiere
Hello
Teak  coverboards! So many cuts and tricky  angles,  Looks great!
:-)
Best YouTube Chanel by far! Can’t wait for the Sampson boat Co T-Shirts.
YAY !!!!!
Wow, !.m first in line for my favorite YouTube channel, Tally Ho. Michael Holley, Koh Samui, Thaiuland.
Nice teak... must be shipped directly from the Burmese military junta...
