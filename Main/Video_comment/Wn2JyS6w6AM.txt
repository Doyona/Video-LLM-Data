Ven el año que viene y nos haces un reportaje en el estadio de la cartuja.
Rangers on a Crusade in the Europa League last 4/5 years 🔴⚪🔵 ONLY SHOW in TOWN 👌
Fair play to the Betis fans for not kicking off about the away fans in their stand
Super Rangers
Im sure you will get rickets  and tickets from the Jimmy Saville testimonial at celtic park
Rangers away support is tremendous.
Are you a rangers fan?????
Class content Sam topman ❤
Cracking coverage as ever Sam, my two nephews were there in amongst the Real Betis fans after being given two tickets by Betis fans they became friends with after the first group stage match in Ibrox and those Betis fans went on their club website telling about how well they'd ben welcomed and taken out by Rangers fans in Glasgow and a couple of fans kindly gave up their tickets to allow two Bears to get into the game.
As a HK ranger this was my first time to see Gers game live at Benito Villamarin, our super sub Roofe and away fans in three terraces completely shut up Betis Ultra since 78 minutes.. i was in euphoria best day in my life🎉😂
I just wondering why there is no 1/8 Europa League matches for Gers in February?
Was that Spanish rangers fan married did you notice? I need a husband! 😂😂😂😂
Scottish football is lucky to have u covering it. Grateful sam 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
8:20 "portsoy loyal" flag, my home town Sam. Haha
That is a brilliant stadium!!
Big love to Antonio at the end there ❤
Great job Bro! 🇬🇧❤️🤍💙🇬🇧
Not all rangers fans are British unionists or royalists or bigots
Classy video Sam my friend, how your not working in TV is beyond me. Football with you in it is a better place. Love your work
I've never seen crisps opened like that before.
No roof? YES ROOFE! XD
Best vlogger around STILL
That top tier of the stand might be the steepest stand I've ever been in.....Felt like I needed a seatbelt!  What a night!! 🔴⚪🔵
Truly amazing night, Love the way both sets of fans sitting together with no issues. Just beautiful  Also best wishes Antonio.
Seville is such a beautiful city, with such warm lovely people, What a game, what a night. Betis were class ♥️🤍💙
Watching our boys singing I was born under a Union Jack brings tears to my eyes - even in Australia. Well done lads WATP.
Ish!Ish! x Bring on Sunday!
Brilliant video as per sam, well done
Great vid mate apart from the snotter at the end. Stay away from Rangers though.  👍👍
Unreal scenes from when you started, proper quality vlog as well 👏👏
If you ever fancy watching a match in Vigo/Celta give us a shout as I live there.Was at the match,great result.Congrats with your success.
You got to hand it to Rangers.
good week for Scottish football. Couple of teams contributed eventually to the coefficient. 😂😂
Made it so much sweeter watching it from this perspective lol
It’s nice being a Rangers fan, now and again 😂
Why do you open Crisps like that?! 😂🤦🏻‍♂️
Love the bears 🐻
Your best video yet, especially as it includes a win for my Beloved rangers. Well done mate
Best ever video footy
Well played Rangers from a Celtic Fan
19:11 😳
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
Magnificent video. Well done to you and to Rangers. It is a good job I am not a betting man or I would have lost money on that result!
Who the fuuuck opens crisps like that
Brilliant
Respect to Betis.  Brilliant to know more about the history of the club.  Proper football club and impeccable fans.  Tremendous.
Brilliant content!
Your content never appears on my time line any more . Need to manully search for it 😢
At least Betis still get to play in European games in the conference league
Great video and coverage. Please continue more for all who cannot make some trips. Really good insight into away days 💙🇬🇧
Bad result for my Spanish boys but well played the Gers .. 💚🖤🤍🇬🇧🇬🇧
Your living my dream job! Keep it up bro ❤
Ryanair go direct to Seville! 💙
Brilliant Sam, one of your yet 👏
Wee bit different from when you were at Tranent earlier in the year
Celtic fan here who watched the game.  Well done 👍   I was very impressed at your guys beating Betis just after them drawing 1-1 with Real Madrid.  Actually shouted YES!!!!!! when Roofe scored 😱 😱 😱   I'm expecting a very tough game on Dec 30th at Celtic Park  😐
Interesting fact: The name of the river Guadalquivir is the spanishized (is that a word?) version of the formerly arab name "Wadi al Kabir" (River of Kabir) .. previously of course, it was called Betis as said in the video..
Superb result for the Gers, heading for Dublin ! All the best to Real Betis in the conference be fantastic for both clubs to pick up European silverware this season. WATP
Why did you open they crisps like that, that played with my OCD😅
Well that was some result for rangers on Thursday night it's pure amazing to think of how many players we had missing and still Clement managed to pick a team that would go out and win and for the first time ever we have beaten a Spanish side in there own doorstep. So proud of each and every one of yous ❤️🤍💙🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧
What an adventure the passion of the Betis fan was something else, that beats a cold wet afternoon in Hamilton
Mate, on TNT Sports and 65k views (as of now...) . So happy for you Sam, and well deserved.
Mad passion from both clubs , it's a way of life . What a veiw  , what a result 🔴⚪️🔵💙🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
incredible video , caught the whole build up , the tension , the passion and the happiness  , excellent watch , one of the best , two absolutely dedicated fan bases with incredible passion and what a show they put on , was like it was the final itself , well done sir
What a journey you've been on yourself bud . We at Rangers don't disappoint in the Europa , home or away 🔴⚪️🔵 RTID
Good video mate, well done rangers we are the people 🇬🇧🇬🇧
Antonio is a legend
60,000 + Views Well done Sam , come a long way since the covid days , well deserved indeed 👍
Brilliant video,and fantastic to see both Betis and Rangers fans mixed together and passionately support clubs without any trouble. It looked a fantastic stadium,atmosphere and club.Best of luck to Betis in Conference League,cracking football side.
Great to see a Scottish club make it into the next stages in Europe. Hopefully Rangers can gather themselves and push forward into the final stages and bring home some silverware.
Great to see both clubs passionately supported...but when the blue of Glasgow see green and white stripes you'll see the fire ignited 😊
Wow, what a video Sam, your best yet!!!
Brillant video !!!
Betis are obviously a very good team and apart from their team colours they seem like a really respectful club. For Scottish teams, beating any team from a top 5 league is a big deal, we don't have their finances or skill levels but our supporters are on another level. I mean no offence to Betis or Spain but in those top 5 leagues the passion of Scottish supporters are only (nearly) matched by the Italians
Great video mate.
Thanks for the shout out
19:00 that's why I go before each half
Feliz Navidad Antonio.
Does it give you 2022 vibes mate I know you followed them to the final then. I don't know how Dublin would cope 😅
nice vdeo.
This is great .two fantastic sets of passionate fans .really enjoyed it..boro fan
Sevilla drops woulda made a fortune last night
Top notch quality video Sam cheers. Couldn't go, so this was absolutely awesome to watch 😊👍
Respect to the guide - get him signed up TNT , not your ordinary taxi driver!!
good to see plenty making the trip across from govan 👍
5000 huns and about 100 fae glesga. Durty hun bastards.
Fantastic video your real Betis fan giving your guide around Seville and the stadium was a class guy .good luck to him and Betis in la liga and European  conference league for rest of season. Great game watp . 🇪🇸🇬🇧🇪🇸🇬🇧
Well deserved son🇬🇧🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿hope you enjoyed yourself
Another great video Sam and a beautiful city don't right us off Dublin here we come RFC.
Lovely city to visit Sam, and you chose a time when it wasnt too hot. I rode my motorbike up from Gibraltar many moons ago, and could only wear shorts, teeshirt and sunglases whilst riding around Seville. It was summer and over 40 Degrees  evening for a Sevilla game at 2200 hours. Brilliant game which i watched on my stream from Berlin. Reckon a draw would have been fair, but at least Betis with them fans, are at least in the Conference league next february. Brilliant content as usual, and you wouldnt have been the only one missing that first goal, with so much liquid consumed
Yaaas🔴⚪️🔵Another good vid Sam🇬🇧👊🏼
Another top vlog.  Great to see the enthusiasm you have for football grounds, big and small.  Was good to see you having a local guide to add a wee bit to your cracking output.
Welcome to the family Antonio 🇬🇧🇬🇧 man I fucking love this club
6 points against Betis, 1 against Limassol, the most Rangers thing ever 😂 Brilliant performance, now onto Hampden on Sunday 💪
Spanish rangers fans first rangers match 😂😂 Brilliant WATP🇬🇧
What is the Spanish guy's name ? He should actually do Tourism, I loved his stories and learned some cool stuff from him in this. Great Video as always.
Super Rangers
Who says he's a twat can't even get history correct ..what a bone head
As a fan of Sparta Prague, I can say that I have never experienced a more complicated European League group. Even the results were strange. Sparta outplayed Rangers for 70 minutes in Prague and only Butland saved a draw for Rangers. At Ibrox, Sparta was missing two of its best defenders, but that is no excuse. Rangers were better that game and deservedly won. It is interesting to note that while Sparta won a single point against Rangers, they handled Limassol quite calmly in both matches, and Rangers, on the other hand, won a single point against them. However, what Rangers did in addition was to beat Betis at home and away. Sparta over Betis only won at home in Prague. So Rangers deservedly won the group by that 1 point. Big congratulations. As a Sparta fan, I am happy that we have also advanced. And who would have said that the Conference League will remain for Betis. As I already wrote, a crazy group, but extremely interesting until the last game. Excellent video Sam. I always enjoy your videos.
Surprised that 'gers fan in front of you didn't get more schtick from the Betis fans around
WATP
Wow that as awesome pre-match when the Betis supporters were singing and you see a stadium of all Betis scarves...bummer you missed the 1st goal.   Let's go RANGERS!!!! that was a he!! of a match. I had some frustration and doubts in that second half but each Rangers goal was great. Wonderful to see Roofe in theri and scoring a scrappy striker's goal! Butland was amazing. It was such a great game!
5:12 fanny fart?
Everyone loves Rangers !
Before the game you were going on about betis wanting a roofe well they got one
Respect to the Betis fans for not causing a fuss with the celebrating Rangers fans in the home section. Good luck to them in the Conference League 🏆
Sam is with TNT because he is dynamite 🧨
Great video Sam. Good on TNP sports and their Foreign Exchange program bringing great content to us on the ground abroad. Superb 👏
Well done Sam, nice to see your hard work and endevour paying off.
Great Vid Sam........Keep up the good work !!!
That Spanish boy at the end bless him man 🇬🇧💙
0:45 who opens crisps like that🤣
Early start at Edinburgh but nay pint wtfff😢
good video mate
Great result, great report, good luck with the channel.
Congratulations Rangers and well done Aberdeen.
Could do without the Union flags but I'll always support a Scottish team like Rangers in Europe
💙💙💙💙 so proud let’s go
Honestly the rangers support is unmatched 💙
He looks like that guy who’s never been on a school trip abroad before.
Fantastic, another great video!
I loved hearing that lad born and raised in Spain and came to Scotland and fell in love with Rangers. Rangers are a special football club and it always fills me with pride and love to see others not from Scotland supporting our dear club. 💙   On a side note, looks a beautiful city and stadium, thoroughly enjoyed the video and even listening to the Real Betis fan you were with.
It's unbelievable how rangers fans support there club
Great atmosphere and result. Rangers do it the hard way!
Bloody amazing mate ❤❤❤
Last night we had a Roofe in the stadium, and he put Betis out😂🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🇬🇧💙
Those huns in the home end look like their favourite sport is domestic violence 😂 can smell them through the phone poor betis fans
No surrender watp
Fucking brilliant
On yae go the mighty Rangers🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧
Celtic fan ,watched the game and knew Rangers were going to pull it off the longer the game went on. We’ve had fans making multiple excuses over the years for why we aren’t competitive in Europenbut the simple fact of the matter is we have appointed Managers who aren’t pragmatic enough to step up to the challenge in Europe . We are too one dimensional and have no plan B. Rangers have proven 4 years out of 5 that with the proper approach you can step up on the European scene from Scotland. Not only proven it but rubber stamped it. It’s all one dominating the SPFL for a decade but the transition from domestic to Europe under Deila ,Rodgers and Postecoglou just hasn’t been good enough. Lennon for all his faults and failings like Strachan before him also proved that a pragmatic approach to setting sides up dependant on the strengths and weakness of the opponents is a far more productive way of solving the problem of stepping up. Rangers have cracked the puzzle and we need to look at how they achieve that. Same as Rangers have looked at how we have achieved success whilst making a profit. Between both approaches you will find the answer to remaking competitive whilst staying solvent. Well done and good luck in the Competition. Back tae watching Celtic in Europe a decade ago on European nights for me meanwhile.
Sam at 23:35 when the Betis support is in front of you and you say He's in the way you sounded like David Brent haha
Rangers flying the flag for Scotland again
love the videos but the way you opened that packet of crisps was a war crime
Congrats to Rangers and Footy Adventures is great to see your channel grow awesome content here!!
Fair play to rangers. Still Scotlands shame no matter what they do or achieve
Best video you’ve done yet Sam👏
As an Englishman Sam does more to promote our game ( at all levels ) than any Scotsman.
U we’re secretly happy when rangers scored
Champions League last 16 🎉 that's a big achievement for a Scottish club !
Awrite Sam we had the only Roof that mattered ……Kemar Roofe 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Love your vids mate, but what are you doing opening a bag of crisps like that, shocking from you that 😂
Fantastic, Gers doing Scotland proud in Europe once again, on and off the pitch unlike thon other mob of shite! WATP
Most rangers thing to drop 5 points to Limassol and then take 6 off Real Betis
What a great vid..could listen to the Spanish guy all day..really nice guy 👌
Everywhere you go in the world it is just teaming with historic clubs, new clubs, passionate people, cultures, stories and diversity interconnected by pyramids feeding into international tournaments. Football is  an amazing thing. It makes me  wonder, have the muppets who came up with the Super League idea a few years back ever stumbled upon a video like this, when they thought they would use the popcorn leagues of North America as a model for European football and ring fence off a selection of plastic clubs from the beautiful game?
Everywhere Anywhere 💙🇬🇧
The club should invite Antonio (Spanish Gers fan) over for a match at Ibrox.
At least you didn't get a ticket at the expense of a rangers fan this time.....Rangers and Celtic tickets are like hens teeth and many times you get tickets for a venture that makes you money.. And fair play well all need work..  But never at the expense of true fans
3 scottish teams win in Europe this week...maybe we`re on our way to regaining some respect in Europe now...maybe 👍
i was born under a union union jack ! get in the Gers.
24:23 - Loved this guy's journey with his fist-pumping lol
Brilliant content mate
Great to see you sponsored Sam and what a great job you do shining a light on Scottish football at all levels. Love the sliding doors transition as well!
We arra people 💪😁🇬🇧
One of the best coverages of a European football trip I have seen. Well done mate WATP
I don’t think it’ll ever cover the pain of our last visit to Seville but it was a great night for Rangers. I think it was nice seeing some coverage of Seville such a beautiful city and I seen nothing of it in the Final. Sam this was one of your best videos and big respect to Real Betis as they let our fans watch the match amongst them.
Brilliant Sam you totally deserve this. Your coverage of all things Scottish football is awesome, and put some of the big broadcasters to shame. Fair play to TNT for noticing your talent. Make sure they send you to Rangers last 16 away tie👍
Love the Spanish rangers fan near the end, class the way he spoke about the famous
Glasgow Rangers! The only reason Scotland have any co-efficient points! WATP GSTK NS FTP 🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧
What a dream job, Sam. And you're doing amazing!
Love the content mate, but that was absolutely criminal how you opened they crisps 🤣
An unbelievable Vlog,  Night and Result for Rangers 👏👏
Really enjoyed your vlog, Sam. A bit different from Meadow Park though.
Great video Keep it up dude
Mon the rangers!! Yaaas
Don’t forget us when your massive bro your going places
Who opens a bag of crisps like that?!?!?! 😂
Hello Sam North Well done on your trip to Sevilla for the Rangers game...great presentation.
I’m a Celtic fan but fair play to Rangers. Seem to be able to pull off these Euro results a lot better than my team at the moment 👍🏻
Honestly you, you cannot hide your allegiances can you. Embarrassing
Na the way bro opened that bag of crisps is mental
❤❤
That was exellent 😊 from start to finish
Rangers absolutely brilliant 👍🏻 qualifying for knock out stages isnt for everyone 🤭😂😂😂🇬🇧🇬🇧
Love your work geeze...
Great result for the mighty Rangers!!  Fans superb!
Best travelled fans in the planet!! ❤️🤍💙
Great video, but the way you opened that packets of crisps is completely unacceptable
No way you interviewed my dad 😂😂😂
Broxburn and Larkhall... Ye canae be fae both 🤣. West Lothian / Lanarkshire.
What a game, great vlog.
Betis fans seem a great bunch. Ive heard a few people from the uk call them bateese and when a spaniard calls it betis you just know its called betis 😂 another thing i love how an englishman takes so much interest in Scottish football fair play.
Can you normally drink inside Spanish stadiums? Rangers fans were complaining of no alcohol inside their part of stadium. Ohiitsstelly has a good video showing what it was like in the away end last night
Rangers ARE Scottish football.
So no bitching tonight about the team.  Would have been a different story without this win. The fans would have been blaming some poor player.
are you staying at the Al Andalus?
great video again Sam,thank you
First time Rangers have beaten a Spanish team in Spain,, against a Betis team unbeaten at home and who hadn't conceded more than 1 goal in any game  at home this season.Some achievement
Good for Scottish football as they say even better we got the result that sends us into knockout stages of europa league and hopefully we can win this trophy Sunday, Aberdeen will be up for after Frankfurt however so will we after last night fantastic result. WATP 🇬🇧RTID 🐻
Good video, as usual, Sam. Congrats on your advancement in your ‘career’. Lovely, passionate guy you had for company. Hope he has good times in the future following his team. Was an insanely fraught match and great achievement by The Mighty. Hope we are as happy come Sunday night. WATP
Love how much Sam pretends he’s not a hun 🤣
Sevco win in Europe but predictably they will bottle it again in the league where it really matters.
Real Betis and Celtic are cousins (Betis took their strip from Celtic /Andalucian flag)
Good to see the fans getting on . Seemed to be a lot of gers in the home end
What a night for Scottish football and the only side who consistently deliver in the Europa league.
It's more special to play against proper football team with bags of history like Betis and Frankfurt💙
Great video Sam....thanks for sharing,
Great video even through a bit of history in 👍🏽
Nice One SAM 👍 🇬🇧
Salute Antonio - the loyal Spanish Rangers man 🙂  & Fair play to the Betis Fans for being so sound. Great Vid Sam. Good to see these opportunities for you and your channel mate.
Good Vlog Sam what a legend Enrique was. You could tell he loves his club
It was one of those games where you feel sorry for the team that lost as they both played some exciting football and anyone could have won it in the end. Some result for the Rangers though not an easy place to go with such a passionate fan base.
Great video Sam, well done to Rangers from a Celtic lad.
Real Betis average attendance is only 51k, i wouldnt say they were one of the best supported teams in Europe, grats to Rangers btw from a Hammer
The tour guide guy was very good
It's good to see this talented, young man being recognised by TNT. Wish him all the best. WATP Glasgow Rangers
I really like this brilliant 👏🏽 but...... the most important thing to see..... GOALS!!!! and we didn't catch any if them 😂
Be happy with the knock-out fase of Europa league .... We will smile from the knock-out fase of the CL .... know your owners  .... 5-1. 🤫
NO TIMS IN EUROPE
Love the fact that they don't segregate the fans in Spain, like we have to here in England.
Honestly I wasn't angry when we dropped to the conference league this gives us a big opportunity to win are first ever European trophy I knew we where never winning the UEL but the conference league is a big opportunity good luck on you journey Rangers show everyone you are their to stay the pride of Scotland 💚💙
We need to find Antonio and get him over to Ibrox for a game.
Brilliant video. Loved seeing the Spanish Rangers fan. ❤
Lovely to hear Antonio who fell in love with Rangers after a visit to Glasgow.   Brilliant first game to go to.   If you're watching this Antonio, get yourself over to Glasgow for a game. You'll be made welcome.   Once a Ger, always a Ger.
Hartlepool. Jesus. Being from Glasgow i know what a shit hole looks like, but man Hartlepool is the most stinking place I’ve been 😂
Great vid 👍 Thank you
trees with oranges lined the streets looks amazing imagine doing that here
Big Antonio the legend!
One think I found interesting is all the Spanish people were wearing jackets in sunny 15 degrees but all rangers fans in summer clothing
Happy to see how well you and your channel have progressed Long may it continue. What a beautiful place to live too also huge respect to the Betis fans
All their singing didn't do them any good, CAUSE WE BEAT THEM!! 😀 it was some atmosphere though.
Nice bogey in your nose at the end of video 😂😂😂
Cracking video Sam well done you deserve these opportunities 👏
Fab as usual sam. ..mon the gers
You call this “atmosphere”😂? I advice you come to Turkey. Good luck
Footy Adventures Loyal. Great video Sam. Celtic fans complaining that you don't cover their great European victories; well, there is a reason for that: there aren't any! GSTK!
nobody gawny ask why the fck u opened they crisps like that wtf 🤣
Great vid Sam, hopefully tnt get u doing more for them
Bears all over the ground what a result🇬🇧W.A.T.P.🇬🇧
Fans were superb
You are a monster for the way you opened those crisps
To the glory-hunting fans from Motherwell. WTF you do have a local team
Heard work pays off Sam. Delighted for you and OBVIOUSLY the Gers. ❤️🤍💙
As much as I would love rangers to get to Dublin,,having Liverpool in the Europa League should make them very strong favourites to win it
Surprised you again Sam, maybe you'll believe now?
Rangers may have been able to go on a little run in the conference league, but it will be a lot more entertaining to watch them concede 10 to a club like Milan or Freiburg.
sell out
Not sure how neutral you are in Scottish football, but never a dull moment following the famous Glasgow Rangers 🎉
Buzzing you’ve got a major network job! Absolutely well deserved. Keep doing outstanding work.
Never thought I would say this but"Congratulations Rangers" for giving Scotland a wee bit of pride
Welcome to Edinburgh Airport we fly to 150 destinations around the world just not Seville 😂
Another brilliant video Sam well done Lad 💙👏👏👏
Went there with chelsea years ago ,Steve Redgrave trained on river for Olympics, met at game ,massive ground improvements ,great work again sam
Cracking video again Sam. Great stuff!!
I reckon Rangers took a lot of confidence from the Celtic result the previous evening going into this match. You're welcome lads 😎
Brilliant video as ever mate😂😂😂
You've got a bogie up yer right nostril.
So happy how far Sam has progressed! TNT well done Sam ❤ 🔴⚪️🔵
Cmon the gers  🎉 what a game roofe
He peed the floor 🤣🤣🤣🤣
TNT sponsorship? Well done mate 👏 👏
Northeast huns are unacceptable
Excellent work Sam absolutely brilliant work Sam what a vlog.  Congratulations  on working with TNT Sports you are going places like Rangers.  Dublin here comes Rangers  now that would be some sight  Rangers fans take over Dublin.   Alan Shields  Hamilton  South Lanarkshire  Scotland.
Great Vlog.  Our fans are amazing. Everywhere..Anywhere. 😍🇬🇧🇬🇧
We're going to Dublin I just have this strange feeling
Don't be a hun Sam, stay neutral
fair play for getting this video edited and uploaded in such a short time mate! CMON RANGERS!!
Editing brilliant again, keep it up! C’Mon on the Rangers!
Love you and your videos Sam but the way you opened those crisps is criminal 🤣
We love Antonio, great video Sam 🔴⚪️🔵
Amazing video!
What monster opens crisps down the side 😂
Cause there's not a team like the Glasgow Rangers 🔴⚪🔵
The mad Spaniard Rangers fan. Well played amigo!
Great vlog. I hear to tackle the environmental problems, away fans will no longer be able to purchase tickets for European games. Hope it don’t come to fruition
Who the fuck opens a bag of crisps like that? Its the jail youre wanting!   Come on the RANGERS!!!
Love the Spanish rangers fan,your welcome buddy
Another great video Sam. Fantastic night and a fantastic result, especially considering we were missing some of our key players. The lads who played really stepped up. 😁👍 And yes, I was watching on Discoveryplus/TNT Sports. Missed the first 20  min of the 2nd half though because there was something strange going on with the stream (kept repeating the half time analysis over and over). Something like that always seems to happen to me when I'm watching TNT sports. Didn't miss any goals though so all good. Cancelled my subscription this morning to save some money for now, but I'll resubscribe for the round of 16 and use your link if still available 👍
Well done RANGER'S 🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧
Was wondering why he wasn’t at Celtic feyenoord but of course he was away watching his favourite Scottish club in Europe. It’s like he’s been told he ain’t welcomed at Celtic park, usually only see Sam in the home end with the prawn sandwich brigade for Celtic away days
Lose 5 points to a team from Cyprus and win the group, welcome to Rangers!
I lived in Broxburn.  But I'm a Livi supporter, as you should be. All these places in Scotland who should be supporting your local teams.
You don't get European nights like that with any other Scottish team eh.... 🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧
what an amazing game of football. Liverpool fans but enjoyed that.
Thank you as always. As a Scotsman who emigrated many years ago I watch your channel religiously to keep up with ALL the leagues in Scotland and thank you again for that.  But if you want to make one of your furthest away fans happy you could take a trip to the first football ground I ever went to and that was around about 1967 in the town of Tranent to watch Tranent  Juniors.  Now that would be a nostalgia trip indeed.  Merry Christmas to you if I don’t message and even better New Year young man 🎉
A famous Rangers manager managed a team from over there.....❤
Nice one bro 💙👌🏻
Well done rangers from Glasgow.. and Aberdeen yesterday 😊
If they go to Dublin we shall follow on! 🇬🇧
What a night 😮‍💨
