Would you guys like to see another muscle masterclass featuring Dr. Mike? If so, let me know what we should hit next!
1:37, 4:42, 2:34
Everyone is just ignoring them. if I saw Jeff and Mike at my gym I’d be shitting myself
Thank you guys!
3:35 The camera man just couldnt help himself 😂
Mike being cringe af like usual
Well this aged like milk.  'extra credibility'
Great video! Love the tips And the vibe! 💛🤙
Dr.have sedentary behaviour!
Just happened to be 50+ Shoulders day in the geriatric ward today.  EZ Bar raises, loved them explosive up and slow down kinda variation on the plate raise but the extra angle does make a difference and nothing in terms of pain on the upper angles.  Will leave these in because I enjoyed them even though I was sore s hell afterwards.  I usually emulate the rear belt machine with my cables but today decided that I would elevate the canes as demonstrated and angle the arms down again nice pump and the extra stretch was felt.  Ran rear dent exactly as shown but felt I was still able to go just as heavy but the focus on keeping art as far out as possible throughout the full rep made one helluva difference especially as the bars returned to starting point.  Both of these staying in as for everything else already doing that and a weee bit more.  Great idea great tips and hopefully I'll be the Buffest 50+ Geriatric in the gym soon ....
@1:20 that's some nice cake
1:24 the girl is so hot in bg.
Great video!
Start to think that you guys are just do it for the pain 😅
10:51 Checkout butt of the year on the right side :)
"Dr." ???

3:30 come on dude , ! every tradesman is laughing at that statement , even retail shelf fillers have to constantly str8 arm shoulders right up to fill top shelves , plasterers have to ALL day for ceiling work, if that causes a pinch pain then there is an imbalance
Rear delts are huge for posture, stability and prehab, train them a lot
Most of these moves seem to be what swimmers do while swimming.
Awesome video
Anyone else watching for tomorrow's shoulder session ✋🏼
5:42
Two best people i know
10:40 a wild Antoine appears!
can i do 2:51 with a straight bar ?
thanks
Jeff Nippard is a fraud, a scammer, and a liar.
Nice 👍
My shoulder makes a painful click when I hyper extend past shoulder height. Getting old sucks
The more u stretch ur delts up the more traps activation no?
Mike looks like if Joe Rogan and Kurt Angle had a baby
1:15 5:37 8:06
Why no one is talking about the reps of each exercise
Question, for the first two.. wouldn't using cables literally be more effective for both their points  Constant tension through the entire movement. You could do pauses, and ofc it's unilateral; it's the best of all worlds or am I tripping?  Tbf you could probably load way more on the machine yes, however, humbling as it may be it's still a good variation I think.
Do you know what lads? Just every now and again  I'd love to see one of either in you a thumbnail with a woman who trains. We have delts too!
who else watching at home at 1am?
Luv to you guys
And to reduce any of my credibility I'll bring in little Mikey poo poo .  Nippard is waaaaaaaaaay smarter than lmpp.
8:46 fruity Jeff
Sweeping the money! Man my rear delts are feeling it!!
Camera man getting a bit distracted at 3:35 😂
Dr. Mike + Jeff Nippard in 1 video. Just watching this is enhancing my gains. This is a master class video.
Please do this kind of video for every muscle group where you explain how the muscle is structured and how you train every part best. Extremely informative! Very well done!
>isratel No thanks. I'll find another video lmao 0:19
Out of all the exercise videos I've ever watched, these videos are by far the most useful and informative
Really good job. Thank you both of u..🎉🎉❤❤
Tried all these today in my workout. Wow, what a pump !!!!
Human body is truly an amazing machine!
8:35 hahahahaha
Straight arm barbell front raise:  Hold a barbell pronated (thumbs down). Raise it slowly out in front of you with arms outstretched, up to above your face. Go down slowly.
My favourite is this version, the standing around the world. Closer to what Jeff was doing.:  https://youtube.com/shorts/m4lHBUQYCp0?si=A5J2zDhHA5k-ol49
At like 9:00 I realized doctor mike kinda sounds like Vince Vahn
Damn who’s that baddie at 4:45
These look good! I've been trying to build my shoulders more since starting HermQ, this will help! 🔥
Solid advice! 👌 Definitely gonna incorporate these into my next shoulder day. Appreciate it!
These look good! I've been trying to build my shoulders more since starting HermQ, this will help! 🔥
Great video! 💪 I'm gonna try adding these to my routine. Thanks for the tips!
Been doing the HermQ program for a while now, and my shoulder gains have been insane. Will try these with it! 💯
Wow, these exercises are intense! I'm seeing great shoulder definition since I started the hermq program. Highly recommend!
5:49 Hey jeff is the behind the back version good or nah?
Ngl those hit shoulders like a bomb. And I ain’t got small shoulders
Jeff ...the EZ Bar Front Raises and Machine Shoulder Presses... are they S tier exercises?
Who’s watching this while at the gym
3:50 jeff really got my attention
I bet you are so broke and drown in debt that are you trying to steal somebody’s content just to make a quick buck…what a loser.
Does it actually differ from the exercise u showed us in past with this machine for real delts??
Does it rly differ with the one u showed with tjis machine??
I'm finna get huge from this
4:39 just guys being dudes
It's nice to see Aldo and Lauralie in the tv on the background
my 2 favorite dudes on the internet
Thank you guy's you're life savers. Sure, I'm more into power lifting and less into bodybuilding, but even still, you guys helped me go a long way
Lateral move ? Can't move my arm that way ? So, do you think i do a machine lateral move? Keep stable? That's what every person gets workouts, sometimes different. Lateral .
I wanna see Ryan humiston ft Jeff nippard that would be insane 😮
5:42  “🗣️THEY DON’T UNDERSTAND THE THINGS I SAY ON TWITTER!🗣️”
10:34 GYAAT DAYUM
I enjoy videos with Mike more when he pulls back all the sex and gay jokes a little bit, from like 5 a minute to 0.4 a minute. Actually solid advice on the side delts super rom, I'm definitely gonna try that one
TLDR: For those who wonder which is the best, which activates the most part of the muscle, don't go there. If you train a lot, just keep switching the excercises from training to training and train in a different wait you were doing it before. That will give you the pump, strech, activation. Don't do the same workout over and over again, there are a lot of stabilizing small muscles all over your body and they need some work too so you can enjoy your retirement. Great video anyway, been lifting 13 years now and everytime i change something in my routine the pump is amazing and the feeling is even better. Stay healthy
Legendary
I dont trust these guys
10:55 holy moly, those legs are huge
I felt so drained and tired everday. I tried everything, preworkouts, youtube gurus, morning routines that nearly killed me. none of it hit. then i saw someone mention Testosterone Rewired by David Brooks in the comments and it literally changed my life. Following everything in that book past couple of weeks made me realize I was running on empty for YEARS. wish I knew about this years ago🔥
not gonna lie, i felt numb for months. like i was just surviving, not really living. then someone dropped Testosterone Rewired by David Brooks in a yt comment and i gave it a shot. bro… this book gave me my edge back. not by yelling at me to hustle, but by showing me how to fix my foundation. life hits different now.
Tried all the hacks. ice baths, preworkouts, even dopamine detoxes. none of it clicked. I felt so tired everyday. then someone dropped Testosterone Rewired by David Brooks in a comment and I checked it out. been locked in ever since. no hype, just clarity. wild how long I was running on fumes.🔥
All exercises are not good
Any one else watching in bed?
we all know deep down Dr. Mike is such a pookie
When doing this exercise 3:58 do I do under grip like with bicep curled or over grip? I have seen both being used so wonder which to use
Took 3 mins until I realised that is not Kurt angle
1:38 that gyatt
they both have round bellies no abs
starting to dislike mike he’s so arrogant and unfunny
TLDR   Highest ROI is to work on the side delts. The two recommended exercises are:   - cross body cable side raises (these are also called Lu raises) - by mike - sweeping raises (these are also called sword raises) - by jeff
This gym is full of babes. Unreal.
I rarely comment on YouTube videos but I’ve tried the whole session in the gym and this hit different. The knowledge provided in the video alongside the exercises are insane. Double XP when you train like this 😂🔥
just got a crazy pump from these movements
Love these collabs
Deathstar Delts! Let's go. 💪
One day I too want to look like a naked chicken.
This channel is a real gold mine of informations for people that go to the gym !
Did anyone else notice the background at 2:02 😂😂
Clowns
On Wegovy right now last month my shoulders went down to baby shoulders gotta build them back up.
Guy sounds like JOCKO brother
didnt you see front raises were F tier
Hes not that funny, but a killer technique freak
not gonna lie, i felt numb for months. like i was just surviving, not really living. then someone dropped Testosterone Rewired by David Brooks in a yt comment and i gave it a shot. bro… this book gave me my edge back. not by yelling at me to hustle, but by showing me how to fix my foundation. life hits different now.
if you're scrolling and feel off, read this. i was burnt out, low energy, not myself. found Testosterone Rewired by David Brooks, had zero expectations but man. chapter by chapter it rebuilt me. no hype bs, not fake motivation just stuff that grounds you and resets your system. this book really saved me. wish I found it sooner.🔥

If you’ve been wondering why you’re not feeling as strong, motivated, or sharp as you used to, Testosterone Rewired by David Brooks might just have the answers. The book focuses on the power of testosterone and how increasing it can seriously transform your health and mindset. If you’re tired of feeling drained or out of balance, this book offers some solid advice on how to get back to your peak
That was brilliant 🎉
Picture Mike sitting on Jeff's shoulders and them wearing a long trenchcoat
These two are downright adorable
dr mike is a tank
Soulders+ steroids😂
Muito inteligente! Essa elevação frontal com a barra é incrível. Parabéns
Doing this while listening to the new Kanye 5:42
❤
Said no great trainer ever! "You don't need to individually train your rear delts"  Mike is one of those guys who says some good shit , and also says a lot of poor shit. You have to sift through it most of the time.
Any watching before the gym😂
Antoine Vaillant with the cameo!!!
6:28 Love Dr Mike's playful side when it comes out. ty 4 vid Jeff. relaxed and to the point. Sub'd.
That paint brush cue is absolutely golden. Erecting this structure thanks to yall💪🏾
Not a big fan of Jeff but this was a good video with great exercises
one of my favorite Dr. Mike quotes is when he says while holding a stack of pepperonis "I want this to taste like semen in my mouth, not just any semen, the semen of a man that has accomplished something"
Blonde baddie in the back
I don’t get it you Train so Hard and don’t get bigger
wild how nobody’s talking about Testosterone Rewired by David Brooks. i saw it randomly on here, checked it out, and it seriously flipped a switch. it’s not hypey bs — it’s straight-up real. sleep better, sharper focus, more drive. feels like i’m finally outta that fog.

If you're watching this while occupying a gym machine, people are judging you for not using the machine.
For side delts, what about behind back cable lateral raiss?
Watch 6:20-6:30 in 2x speed
7:20 why did he say yes like he was training a dog??
Si
What did he say @1:30... i was distracted 😅
Dropping the weight on my head is always a paranoia I have during shoulder press.

WONDERFUL 🥰❤️
Anyone else notice that the camera guy is purposely getting these booties in the frame? Lol I watched the camera zoom pan over to the booties and it was very noticeable 😂
Hey everyone, just wanted to remind yall that Jesus Christ loves each and every one of you and wants a relationship with you. John 3:16. Jesus died a horrible death for us so we need to love and accept Him in everything we do.❤
I can only afford commercial gyms, so I generally hate machines. Machines in commercial gyms almost never have enough range of motion to give me a fully loaded stretch.
It's easy to forget your joints in your nutrition. Oily fish as well as your protein and carbs. The good old fashioned fish supper (that's battered and deep fried fish and chips, chunky fries for yanks). It has what you need for a good workout and is quite tasty.
I often try to get the last negative of the last set as slow as I possibly can, just in case it promotes extra growth. I'm glad it does 😂, not doing this for peanut
You guys are doing this for yourself right? Or … maybe for women with fake things 😅
NO thanks. Most shoulder exercises that require me to raise my arms above shoulder lead to injury.
Put the hand you aren’t using behind your back
5:54 what about behind the body?
I got a shoulder pump just watching this...💪🏼😃
This isratel guy is a sellout disliked your videos, hes a genocider
Yep😂 as I warmup on the bike
Is this Pure Muscle + Fitness in Burlington?
I would hate to have this guys voice as a man…you’d almost to get jacked to make up for it
well i would love to hear all the off camera analogies by Dr. Mike xD
nice micky mouse voice
We get this for free. This is awesome!
2 buffed up babies 😊💪
A desert island? You mean a deserted island......learning is fun.
10:43 Jeff's "I change my mind" was so wholesome
Dr. Mike is the funny trainer we all need.
Thank You, thank you, and Thank You.
Good vid! But Mike’s shirt looks goofy af 😂😂😂
120 cm x 90 kg....and you think that's good loock?
Just wanna say, I loved Dr. Mike's explanation!
SLOW
"you run a nice wholesome channel here, so i'll just shut up now." Immediately makes dumbell wiener lmaooo classic mike!
5:43 of cource there's nothing wrong with that, it's America 2025
I watch it at the gym Cuz it’s like Dr Mike and I are competing for the same fertile ovulating female but it’s just Jeff Nippard. It helps get my test up cuz I don’t get it from a little glass vial. I’m not even gay but whatever it takes ya feel me?
Damn man - Mike is so cringe. I know a lot find him funny but fuck he just isnt.
Thank you for sharing this with us 💪🏾
The amount of information that comes from these video when you and Mike team up is crazy. Two sometimes vastly different looks on something with so much great information. Videos like this are helping me put together my routine as we speak. I use to workout 20+ years ago then life and family got in the way, so now Im trying to get back into it and its very interesting whats out there now for information to help you make good informative decisions.
9:00 "Like you are gonna do another one" stealing this one, amazing advice for last negative
Rear delt flys are a waste      Athlean X.
Lower back exercise plz!
Posted Nov 2023, and in May 2024 you posted on Leaning Lateral raise (short vid though, so not sure if clipped from an earlier vid?).  Which side lats would be best then, the full circle or the lean?
Amazing
5:42 austrian painter moment
Camera man fought demons at 3:35 with that slight zoom lol
Mikes side delt over head raise with dumbbells is a ridiculous pump
Is the consensus that Jeff has never touched a single syringe?  Dude is huge that would be so impressive.
Dr. Mike looks like if Jynxzi was a bodybuilder
Top video!
super-rom lateral raise with 10lbs dumbbells gave me the most pump I've ever seen, just wanted to say thank you!!!!
Do you train shoulders as their own workout session? Or just mix it up throughout other upper body days?
Ty was looking for this exact information.
I wish they talk a little less and fo the workout.
These two dudes are gay.
🤣You can really see how Dr. Mike's Jewish heritage influences his analogies: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21lYP86dHW4&t=518s
This video made me miss John Meadows. He just kept it real even if it was obvious. No one is doing any of these exercise as their main motion for any dealt.
thank you doc
Scientific tren twins? Love this duo
Jeff crazily out of proportion for short guy

Great tips🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
The shoulder above 90 goes automatically into ex rot. So if you go thumbs down then you are doing scapulothoracic. Rather than deltoid per session. Deltoid cannot contract further past 90.
Dream collab
going to the gym is a pain. I only want the gains 😢.Hard work is hard
Thank you guys, it was very helpful
1:34  good form there really nice and round
1:25 maybe eat less shit and get more power your look out is powerfull but your real power is like a 12 year old kid...
I love that paint brush metaphor!
Actually you could use resistance bands for the front deltoids exercise when the machine is not available
If Dana White and Kurt Angle had a baby
Hi Jeff. A Question: at 6:20 in the sword movement why not keep the arm in the up position but  parallel to the floor?
Midget posedown - comedy gold
Thanks for the tips BOYZ 💪 could U do a episode on a cable machine N smith machine built in, I just bought 1 n Wana know more exercises to do with it🤔😎✌️🇨🇦
Two of my favorite
Just did the full rom, side delt exercise and it is game changing. Feels amazing.
MIKES HAMMYS ARE CRAZY
Yeah, OK…. there’s more going on than just lifting the weight. That’s just my opinion.
Dr Mike Jewishness in full force 😂
Kurt angle knows his stuff
Thank you, training delts now. These seem harder so I lowered the weight.
Lateral raises Aren't Very good at geting massive Shoulders  These channels got Stop show us  weak works outs Lateral raises Chest Flys Aren't that great for good results 😅😅😅
Super ROM Lateral Raise = LU Raise
"Exercise scientist" that consumes pills like they are gummy bears. I guess everyone on social media is an expert nowadays.
Anyone else is watching this in the gym?
Great video, I'm trying to find the reason people often suggest doing lateral raises slightly in front of the body?  Apparently the arms & torso slightly leaning forward better engages the side delts, I'm just trying to find evidence
my biggest fear is i'll do something like the side delt raise, and i'll look like a goof in the gym doing half-jumping jacks. I'll stop at parallel lol
In every shot there is a new girl in the background. Where is this place?
How can I do the last two exercises with dumbbells?
definetly no issues with  the shoulders as you grip on the bar with supinated hands
You guys make great videos together. Loved this one. Thanks!!
What would you recommend for a home workout with tension cords for the same results?
I need a real life trainer Damnn
Never trust a man with small hands
The super rom movements are killer workout.  Feeling more sore than the regular Lateral and Front raises
Thank you brother. This video helps with my shoulder weakness, pain and clicking/cracking sounds. Excellent explanations. Thanks to Dr. Mike too, hilarious and amazing guy, I watched his video about V-shape body before and it is greatly fundamental. I hoped there'd be other series like this for other muscles.
My favourite duo
Wow this is some good stuff!
6:27 I hope their moms let them play again soon
Jeffery is huge.
1) Dips 2) Dips 3) Dips
That reverse peck deck is truly a game changer
Thank you so much for these! I have one question regarding grip for front raises (z bar or dumbells). I see Mike is using grip with palms facing up, what the difference if I use grip with palms facing down (knuckles up)? thank you!
4:39 i dont know mike was jeffing his nippard harder than last time right there!
In The reverse peck deck the elbow is nos slight bended?
What are these exercises even called
Raising you arm above the horizontal for medial delts makes no sense. Past 90 degrees of abduction your scapula takes over and further motion is facilitated by your traps. Once your scapula starts to lift, medial deltoid contraction is done. You may get isometric contraction of the delts but that's it. This is why no one does half-motion laterals above 90 degrees. Muscle action is very simple. muscles contract/shorten from insertion to origin. So they pull two attachment points closer together and either relax or hold them there. Period
Really wholesome seeing father and son doing workouts together
Would love two natural bodybuilders more.
Bro u havent told us about the ranges for side cabel and rear selts cabel and peck deck
Wish I had cable machines at work. Only 1 and its very limited. Hate Vectra machines.
10:41 is that friggin Antoine?
Can anybody explain me whats the advantage of super rom side delts vs "normal" ones? Thanks :)
Man how am I gonna make this level of content for my youtube Channel! Its just imposible :(  so top!
That rear delt variation of going a bit further must be a valious tip for swimming Power.
You mention muscle growth a lot, but is that different than strength? If my goal is to be able to lift more weight, will the variation be different?
8:40 Haha such a jewish way to teach technique. He does not beat the stereotype 😂
How many exercises per shoulder day? One for each part of shoulder?
10:07 Thor in the gym
It's a gold for shoulders.
this robotic stuff looks rediculous
I am looking for that person who comment all the exercises 🥲
Going above the 90 degree engages traps, therefore what kind of logic is that from a PhD in exercise science???
Good comment about that last rep. There is a guy at my gym I call The Slammer because he literally drops the last rep of every set he does (with very heavy weights) 🤦‍♂
5:44 ayo
First video I've seen on ur channel I believe,  I've seen you and listened to you speak with others about lifting, and I half to say I respect you knowledge and the results speak for themselves.  Great stuff sir.
Nice.
I strongly disagree with the rear delts because you guys negate the external rotation of the rear deltoid
I knew Front Delts don't have to be directly worked on but I didn't know it applies to Rear Delts too, thank you!
At 7:50, wouldn't going that far make you work your trapezius?
great video , thank you
This is the first gym where I saw more girls than boys
Any chance we can get a video showing how to do these exercises with dumbbells?
@mukeshgahlot sir spotted guruji 😃😃
Isn’t this body dysmorphia!  This isn’t for any health reasons in fact the steroid use to achieve this is extremely detrimental!
God loves you all so so much that He WAS WILLING to send HIS only Son Jesus Christ down onto earth to die on the Cross for all of our sins
Yall are my go to on my next journey in fitness
Could you do this on a standard deadlift bar?
Excellent video, instant subscribe .
Nice to see you two exercising :)
jeffs triceps are insane wtffffff
that first side delt exercise is killer
Learned a lot from this video  Rlly loved how yall broke everything down 👍🏼 definitely subscribed
Mukesh Guruji
8:40 most jew analogy ever
What did he do with the 2 dumbells in last showing what he is in his mind. thats not a sign of professional body builder.
Hey Jeff I've been following you for quite some time thank you for all the workouts and all the advice throughout the years... dude my side delts hurts after a chest workout I'm pressing properly but it's almost like my side delts are growing from pressing from chest day please help... they don't feel impinged they feel tight
Is this still updated because I still do some of these?
Bro, if you need to get something from on top of a cupboard. Usually, you don't have a 20lb weight or heavier in your hand. Right?🤔
Big ups both of them.
thanx dudes. BTC too the Mars
What a freaking cue for the reverse peck deck 🤣
dr. mike and jeff (great duo )
Man they look creepy af without shirt
The money sweep analogy is crazy good
All exercise 1 set or 3 set?
Superlaterals?? Trapezius (upper and lower) makes the job to rotate and elevate the scapula, from 90 degrees on. Side delt is just a stabilizer in that range. Amazing these guys recommend that (rare) exercise.
Loved this informative vid! Thanks so much! I will definitely be incorporating these tips into my routine.  (Also, it was so weird watching an entire video with Dr. Mike in it, and not hearing a single adolescent, 12-year-old-boy-trying-to-impress-his-friends, awkward sexual joke!)
Hi, Jeff Bro. I'm writing you from Dhaka, Bangladesh (south East Asia). Requesting your and Dr. Mike's advice/guidance on Delt development exercises. Is TUT effective for delt exercises, I mean -  doing few reps with heavier weights? Mike Mentzer, hayden Steele and several other had that philosophy. Best Regards.
That's nc technique to stimulus of Stretch reflex bcs of that more muscle motor recruitment, and eccentric loading as good way to break down more muscles fibers💪
Всенда говорили, что в стороны надо и не доводить до уровня плеча, тут по всей амплитуде. И в приседаниях так же- новый тренд не до параллели, а прям садиться до конца
Would see to you include an exercise for those with limited equipment. People who have a home gym for example and have access to a cable fly or pec dec
Facepulls to strengthen rotator cuff and avoid shoulder injury
Dr Mike is a smart ass Jew.
Lets just stick to the basics
Excellent video! I do wish at least 1 of the rear delt picks was with free weights... I lift at home with free weights.
I want to use that shoulder press machine so bad
who's the trainer?
Love these two guys
dang jeff’s side delt movement is 🔥 can’t wait to hit it tomorrow
Jeff's reverence for Dr. Mike Israetel is always so awesome and the respect Mike gives back.
In this video we wanna see how you got karate chopped into neck
Boring
Maybe just more footage of exercises for the visual learners 🤓
Appreciate this video so much. Thank you for the content, I tried this workout yesterday and I feel soreness in muscles I have not felt before. Amazing!
Love it!
1:19 all the trension was directed to the woman..........
I couldnt help but think of how i can incorporate this "outside sweeping" queue into compound upper back exercises in attempt to bypass trap involvement.  Eg. Supported high chest row, i imagine pulling the bar apart as i contract, as if im trying to sweep as far outside as i can.
Bald guy's voice is like Dexter's, from the american show Dexter
This is like so perfect
Nice video ! thanks for the info and breakdown !
why did front and side delts only have two exercises
Any one tried it out I’m off to try it tomorrow
The ez bar front raises also target the biceps though
Best bodybuilding duo ever! Thanks for the info guys! :)
So basically, you simulate swimming strokes in the gym. This is why swimmers have massive triangle builds
The end killed me 😂😂 Dr Milk you’re so funny
I wonder if any research supports that supinated front deltoid raises are more effective? When I simply front raise my arm supinated I can feel more of a contraction as opposed to pronated front raises.
didn’t say how much times clearly
6:25 sword cue is amazing well done 👍🏼
This gave me the most insane pump ever. Feel like I'm a beginner again. Got some strange looks at the gym but who cares xD
The reaching for the cupboard analogy was pretty dumb since you only have to lift the weight of your arm. That doesn't mean that lifting with significant load in that range doesn't carry more risk
The biggest things i wish i could tell young me is weight doesn't matter and focus on the stretch
Mike is awesome when you don’t let him talk too much. Lol I love Mike.
Dislaik
I am a novice and my comment will probably be ignored entirely. But I just have to point out that I have followed the cue by dr Mike at 8:30 and it did not work. With such cue my scapula curved in at my extended position and when I pulled I activated mostly my traps instead of my rear delt. I tried keeping my chest up at the same time reach as far as possible with my arms and it hit my delts much harder, even though I have to use much lighter weight.
Dont know if i missed you saying but how many sets for each exercise?
Gotta agree with Dr Mike on focusing more on the side delts.
This video is GOLD!!
Get a bad pinch on right shoulder unless i bend elbow or go palms up
8:35  Mike really knows how to sweep money while doing real delt fly's like he's Jewish.  Oh wait; he is😂
i love how relax Mike is with Jeff , almost as if they've known each other for a life time 🙌🏾
dude at this point it's a solid bromance. straight bromance
Refreshing to listen something new. Istarted to losten this episode two days ago, and every segment has helped to understand me better and to fight for me💪
Ty I’ve been wanting to work on my side delta
So good having you two together on one video .. thanks
2 super short jacked kings
This is a perfect video to post comment from ex skinny guy. In last 6 months I gained over 40lbs of pure lean muscles, no fat. I started with exercising 4 times per week at the gym, and I also took a meal plan from OnlyMeal. My shoulders are finally getting that 3D look, and I get so many compliments on my physique. So if you want great, aesthetic shoulders, start eating more proteins and carbs, and work as hard as you can.
This changed my workouts for shoulders entirely, I always had a hard time getting good engagement and would irritate my joints easily.Doing these with lower weight increased my muscle engagement and decreased joint tension.
So much game
I'm seriously impressed with Jeff's shoulder mobility. I cannot get my arms anywhere near my ears for that dumb bell side raise, but I'll continue to work on it. The more I learn and grow in both knowledge and strength the more I'm convinced that poor mobility indicates weakness, so I'm sure that as my shoulders get stronger my mobility will improve. I already proved this to myself as far as raising my arms to my ears in front of me goes (lat strength/mobility) so I'm excited to keep doing these moves and see both areas improve. Also, for a middle aged woman I already have pretty jacked shoulders and I want to see what doing more than military presses does for that 3-D shape. Thank you for the excellent content, I love this collaboration!
5:43  *pause*  "Auf der Heide blümt ein kleines Blümelein, und das heißt ERIKAAA" 🫡
Dr. Mike always drops some valuable knowledge. Can't wait to try these exercises and see how my shoulders progress.
Huge triceps Jeff :)
you re my number one
Great tips. Thank you!! I'm 51 years and just returning to the gym after 1 year (injuries, weight & strenght loss due to diabetes complications)  This is my second month. I recovered 10 kg (22 lb)  1. Should I do shoulder 1 or 2 times a week? 2. Is it better to split the exercises you showed us in a two day routine (3 exercises each day) 3. What is the ideal body part combination along with shoulder?  🙏🏻 Thanks in advance!!
Tried it Best my shoulders felt after a workout  Muscles totally drained
SHOULDER PREESS 2:24   EZ BAR FRONT RAISE 2:36 higher rep 20 rep  SUPER ROM LATERAL 4:46 higher rep 10,20   CROSS BODY Y RAISE 5:35  REVERSE PRC DEC FLY  8:06
dr. mike just brings SO much entertainment into every video he is in its crazy
Wait, bro dropped the rizz at 4:39 but it went un-noticed
tool
Jeff the chipmunk-voiced kid
Do you keep your shoulder blades locked in , whiles doing all this ? Or do you relax them ?
Having you 2 do a video together rocks !  I follow both and honestly you both give me best advice as I’m off to gym now and gonna raise up my cable rear delta as I was forehead level.  Can’t wait to feel results.  Thanks for working together, look forward to more .
Must be really cool to train with you guys
I have an unstable shoulder and watching this video was very painful.
If you would train a large language model with what Jeff and Mike say, it would spit out "strech" at least 4 times in every possible sentence xD. "Honey, could you take milk from the store but with maximum stretch?"
As someone currently nursing a shoulder impingement, Mike's Super ROM Lateral Raises, the ROM during any front raises mentioned at 03:35 as well as the cable lateral raises Jeff does at 06:18 are very good for building strength to help prevent impingement.
I’d love to have Dr. Mike setup a program for me.
Not gonna lie at first thought you were a total need. Now I use alot of your training tips. Keep it up man
How many exercises do I need to do per ''delt''?
Just had the best shoulder day I’ve had in years
5:37 bookmark
😂😂😂 jeff nippels
I literally just came across these two chaps’ channels and feel blessed to have watched this collab! I hope they do more! Thnx, guys! 🙏🏽
Okay, I'll talk in the side I definitely will be doing these cables for my next shoulder exercise
Hey, that's that guy that got beat up and be slapped like a little bee. Why are they pretending like they're doing anything other than picking weights up and putting weights down. It's that simple pick weights up and put them down do it a bunch of times and your muscles will grow
great vid guys. thank you.
how many sets and reps tho?
The ending reminds me of the classic Jackie Chan movies where they have bloopers.
I didn't know Dr Mike was as tall as you
Okay, I'm going to the gym right now to kill my shoulders and I'll definitely do all of these exercises which you explained! Thanks mate!
One of my favorite YT team ups
Watching this video at 2X speed seems more natural because then your voices match your bodies.
Awesome job together-Master Class
It would be hilarious if you did a bit with comedian Drew Lynch, some play on Carrot Top getting buff, where Drew becomes you, as you two look very much alike.
Why does dr mike look really fat!! Keep him away from donuts
how many exercises (and reps & sets) do you need to do for each part of the delt (rear/mid/ front)?
This was super necessary! Thank you.
that was fascinating thanks
Mike is witty
I just found my motivation for today’s shoulder workout. Thank you
I love @antoine87, too....
4:35 my shoulders sound like an elastic band snapping if I go even slightly above 90 degrees lol. How to solve?
Great advice from 2 legends...
I wonder, would dude have done to Mike what he did to Jeff? I mean they are about the same size. F no, we all know the outcome.
Love these guys together. Awasome. Be great to grab a coffee with both of them
Omg I did 5lbs with these exercises and it burned so bad way more than when I would use 35lbs.
Jeff -- quality content.
Hbaja
I loved mike❤
I just want to clarify, should all of these exercises be done or just one exercise for each section of the three shoulder muscles and how many rounds should be done?
Is it necessary to do 2 exercises for each 3 parts of shoulder
Jeff I love your videos. I found Dr. Mike first and then came across your channel afterwards and the two of you have been a huge help for my workouts. I’ve only been back in the gym for 6 weeks and I’m seeing huge gains already and it’s all because of the things I have learned from my Dr. Mike and you so thank you!
A duo we never knew we needed
Both of you are short....you can flip under the bed 😉🦍🤣👌
When I hear the gurus and experts say things I've been doing naturally for the same reason I am doing it...makes me feel like a genius.
Jeff looks quite big even compared to Dr. Mike. That's testament to why science-based lifting works.
3:50 Jeff just Turing into a monkey😭😭
Awesome content
I feel like another reason to train all 3 heads of the delts is to prevent injuries related to the an imbalance from front, side and back.  I suffered a shoulder injury a out 10 years ago and I think it may have been that I didn't give enough attention to the rear delts.
cable cross exercise is good ?
What a pair of tits
why do I always tweak the muscles in my neck doing any type of lateral raise? sometimes they get so tight, they start causing headaches.
Was that Antoine Vaillant?
This is my favourite couple on the internet atm! ❤
Definitely try tank u
Thanks guys! Great collaboration! Off course I want to see more videos like this one
Should you do a retraction while doing these exercises ? 🤔
Okay was that freakin buttcrack sweat at 7:09 on mike or is that just a shadow... Strange 🤔thats the only place he seems to have broken a sweat from...
People! All of these influencers are full of 💩. Just go to the gym and workout, sleep, eat and you will get bigger. No one here is competing for the Olympia. Otherwise you wouldn’t be watching YouTube videos as guidance. Let’s shut all of these idiots down. They’re all making money because you’re all too lazy to get up and just go to the damn gym, put in the work, eat the food and get the sleep. Jesus Christ please help us.
What if I’m feeling popping in my shoulder when doing the y cable raise?
I just want to ask what happened to Joe Rogen
Dr mike looks like a giant baby
7:34
Love Mike and Jeff's broship, wish I had gym friend like them.
People in gym are not aware of  the cable later rises jeff showed. So theg keeping telling me it is not good or it will injure you.
Any alternative to the first exercise cz i Dont have that machine..
Incredible video, the front delt pump is crazy. Hoping to continue these and see the results!
mike and jeff is so bonita ❤😝🎀
@1:00 why is this man so red?
Tried these exercises and mind blown. Sickest pump ive ever felt💀
Had schoulders today and did the full rom lat raise with 5,5kg and dammm
Those Super-Rom Lateral Raises are no joke. I’m typing this right before I go into my 3rd set and I swear I can hear Dr. Mike in both dumbbells like holding a conch to my ear and hearing the ocean…
Dang Mike got the hgh gut now
2:30 I'm working the EZ-Bar front raise into my shoulder day. After a few tries, I feel like it's working my traps too much.🤔
Thanks Jeffrey Nipski!
0:12 this is soooo funny 😭😭😭
big thanks to jeff for helping me get thiccer but stay natty
Didn’t know you guys were both vertically challenged, like your proportions in the videos and pictures make you look massive
What if I can’t get a deep stretch without a pop or click and yes shoulder back and down before I press
This video was unwatchable due to the youtube ads
Yes 💯 % his knowledge is amazing
How many sets total if I skip front delta and do 1 of each exercise
2 legends. Thank you fellas.
My favourite gym youtubers in one vid, thanks💪
Great video thank you.
A whole series with the two of you plus Eric
Wth Heck Jeff Nipp in another video rates Cable lateral raises and Cable Y raises as his favorite side delt workout?? Why the inconsistentancy bro??? https://youtu.be/SgyUoY0IZ7A?si=ctfO9-YQh9NRJRKs
so the big take away is to go further, deeper, slower on everything
Question. I do not have a home gym. And I do not want to buy a gym membership. I do have a incline bench. And dumbbells. Would incline Dumbbell Reverse Fly's  work for rear delts?
Nice so much valuable knowledge thank you for sharing and thank you gym for letting us hear them comfortably
Just tried some of these and what a game changer
Did that EZ-bar front raise today …straight after shoulder press …they were smoking 💪🏼
Best BB Content
Does this benefit boxing?
What a monster - 10:41.
I do all of Jeff's favorites, exactly the way both of you instructed.  Especially the Rdar-Delt Flys and the Side Lateral Raises.  Big fan of the Last Rep Negative!!!
I’ve never had any sort of sports science education; but I used to do those super rom reverse flys and I remember I used to alternate hands going above and below each set because I thought surely this little thing is going to cause issues etc. so it’s true not to cause asymmetry I’m happy with myself. Little ocd thought turned out to be actually useful😂
Love it when you say the word bar
Thats great explanation worh some amazing facts and insights
How do you build Delts without machines. Many of us don't have gym memberships and use free weights at home. Thanks!!
@0:10 Dr Mike looks like a super buff toddler in his pose down. It's crazy that these two short kings managed to connect on video. You almost never see Mike looking the same height as a man on camera.
Great video
Seated overhead bad for the back.
I want you to do a celebrity workout video w dr mike. Critique or praise depending on who
I ve never seen Dr Mike So Happy
are their an exact amount to each rep or do all to failure?
wtf is jeff doing 3:52 😂😂
K I’m off to buy a complete gym👎
Great video, the 2 best coaches working together!
jeff is actually quite big
Did this guy die from unrelated heart problems as well ?
Killer collab!
This feels like batman and nightwing
9:00 do the last rep as if youre going to do another, so that the last negative is coming too
Hi
Today I did exactly same sequence. Believe me this set hits differently, total 3d is on fire. Thanks to Jeff for this collab.
sick video !
I always watch mike’s reactions on instagram and that man never lies 😂 he is a real G
Late to this, but I find that it makes it easier to stabilize yourself in a 1 arm lift to put your hand right underneath your chest with your thumb in the middle. It helps you keep your balance a little better. That or your finger on your belly🤙🏽
10:38 Jeff got embarrassed lmao
No upright row?
Dr Mike can’t help himself using metaphors every other sentence
i need Mike to couch me. i love all his analogy's lol
Can the EZ-Bar front raise be performed with a pronated grip?
I would take your advice but you're too small so your physique results prove your techniques don't work
Oh, and don’t forget to mention to jab yourself with some trt. 😊
This was your best video yet. Would love to see you do more with Mike and train other parts of the body. Love your work Jeff.
With the EZ bar frontal raises, why do you lift it all the way overhead? I don’t really feel any tension or resistance past the shoulder level
Dr Mike reminds of Kurt Angle only cooler
Lmao listen to this jew. "WHERES MY GLASSES??!!?" South park ass
You mention reps but how many sets?
Finally Dr.Mike is a tall one  🤣😂🙃😂🤣😂🙃😂🤣🤣😂🙃😂🤣🙃
Y raises are so underrated
Doing lateral raises all the way to the top seems kind of weird, since you're getting the complete opposite of a stretch there
My picks: 2:29 front delt 5:37 mid delt 8:18 rear delt
My front  debts are not growing
05:43 Jeff using the forbidden emote.
Thanks, mate. I had a wonderful pump today. I never felt that before. Just followed your tips.
8:29
The exact vid I was looking for about to have some boulders soon 🔥 🔥
Deep stretch!
Thanks for the free information and demonstrating
Can you make a video about which format of a weekly training routine should look like must it be a bro split or a push pull legs and how much sets a week and so on please
geek boy
Great tutorial
that baddie at 1:23
5:43 poskhalco
Are there any beginner-friendly exercises for the shoulders? These seem quite advanced.
Yes on the b-roll. More of that. Awesome.
Are they both natty?
I like how Mike gave the most jewish cue ever for the reverse pec deck.
The tvs at a normal gym play gym videos while planet fitness plays fast food commercials lmaoo
Best collab so far!
This video, for where I'm at in my fitness journey, is absolute perfection. I've also had some joint issues over the years from work. So, having someone explain motion and technique is super important for me. Thank you
One look at any pro body builder should be enough to turn any normal man off ever doing roids...Why on earth would anyone want to look like such a bulky freakazoid is beyond me....Stay natty fellas, nothing beats a muscular athletic physique....
Great video!
The rear delts are the most backburner imo
Love the empanada machine
Bro I've been doing the second front delt exercise wrong.. I've only been going up to about level with my shoulders, not any higher, no wonder my traps are the only thing that are sore.
Awesome but how do i program this, i used to do powerlifting but I have POTS so powerlifting is over.  I don’t know how to structure anything non barbell.
That guy is so funny 😂
3:35 cameraman thinks he's slick
Wouldn't the Y raise be better at a hip height setting? Starting the db laterals at a 45 degree angle is better, no? Bringing all the way up doesn't that take away all stress and should be kept up to 45 degrees.
Thank you for this! Excellent info!
pause 5:43
This is so awesome. Two smart guys sharing their knowledge. Wow. Keep on going!
I can’t take these exercises seriously based on the size of their delts
The tittle says 3 but they show like 17 exercises 😅❤
Step 1: inject 'roids. The end
wow nice
is that antoine vaillant at 10:42?
5:40
Very nice training insights guys! 🎉
I feel like Jeff got a little bigger looks great
I'm new to the whole fitness thing and these videos are honestly so...idk the word for it... approachable (?). I love them. Keep up the excellent work
I like the theory with the money 💰 😊 thank you guys 💪🏾
Long time subscriber to RP and Mike, glad to see the collaboration with him, really digging the content Jeff, keep it up.
That super rom raise is very similar to a Lu Raise. My personal favorite shoulder strength and mobility exercise. Great to implement if you're an Olympic lifter or strongman. Also give plenty of hypertrophic benefit
With the front delt raise: i really focused on squeezing my scaps. Lost a  little range of motion at the top but felt it so much more
You should not do side raises on the cable from below. Much better to set at hip height because there is permanent tension in the stretch.
....front, side, back.... try anterior, lateral, posterior...
Money analogy makes so much sense 😂❤
Best shoulder advice I’ve ever heard. Great video!
Every day is a lesson with Dr Mike and Jeff. They do it with a sense of humour too, which makes them more engaging. I'm also a big fan Jeff Cavaliere (Athlean X). They come at it from different angles, the former from a bodybuilding point of view and the latter from more a functional, physical therapist side, but they all teach me something.
We are so lucky to have this info at out finger tips!
Just tried these modifications for cable lateral raise. Wow, best side delt pump I’ve had in a while. Keep up the good work!
if the front delt exercice number2 is with the bar without adding weights on it?
Is that Antione Vailant in the background as Thor?
holy shit they're both like 4 feet tall
Terrible video .!!!
Damn, can’t do these. Shot rotator……..hurts like hell….
Reverse peck deck is even better if you can rest your forearms on the handles. Lean the head forward and shift your butt back on the seat. Insane activation 🎉🎉
Where can I order my ''As if another'' t-shirt ?
8:40 of course the Jew would say that ahahaha
I applied their workout techniques on my normal lift and was completely humbled. Getting that full stretch really makes a difference.
I love your beginner's mindset while doing this
Epic duo
This guy is amazing, I've been a fan for years. I haven't watched any of his videos since I stopped going to the gym. That's been 7 years, and now I'm back for my first week. I was a bit confused about what shoulder exercises to do because I'm no longer able to do what I used to. Thankfully, this video helped me out a lot. I'm going to let go of my ego and focus on control and tension. It's a marathon, not a sprint.
Thought he is our Indian rock gehlotguruji
Game changer
Bro got the wingspan of a moth
Great video ! Thank you.
It's crazy Jeff is lifetime natural and looks similar to enhanced
turning the music down for you filming is a goat move.
4:39 Bro tried hitting on Nippard but got instantly rejected there lmao
Wouldnt they be more than 3d since we live in a world with more than 3 dimensoons..?
Those idiots are working out without belts💩
Is it just me, or Dr Mike's physique looks like your average fat/roided dude ?
When dr Mike wants to look taller-lets meet Jeff
Shite work outs. Bringing in Latts with rear delts with those cables.
Sloe. Sloe. Sloe. Sloe.
How many sets per exercise?
If Dr. Mike and Jeff Nippard are giving you advice, you better sit your glutes down and pay attention.
Bro told you are my nbr 1 and you completely ignored him 😂😂😂
Te iba a seguir pero no hay traducción al español lo siento.
Thank you, may God bless you all and everyone. ❤
Bro thank you it’s shoulder day
Looks like a Gold’s gym but it says “rise” 😂
SLOW  AS IF YOUR DOING ANOTHER ONE HALF A PIZZA . . . . . . . . Ican do this.
nice video
This was such a useful video thanks
if you see that Dr. Mike Israetel is in a video, you know theres some serious good stuff in it. :)
two short short kings
5:43 here's the roman salute hehe
Almost 5 million views is insane
Dr. Mike is a legend for sure
Science!
Can the front raise be done with dumbbells if we don't have access to an EZ bar or a machine?
0:11 toddlers when their favorite uncle asks them if they're strong
Thanks!
Buddy.. worked out on and off for 15 years and that little bit extra stretch  both behind back  and overhead his rough at first but man watta stretch. Also buddy is hilarious.. great combo 👌  ye guys. Thanks for sharing 👍
Thank you gentlemen for the vid.
I’m trying to hit these exercises and then mid rep I hear “there are many number ones, you’re my number one” like I can’t
5:35; mama got a BACK
Can i do like 1 arm first then the oder arm couse i dont have the machines 4 it
4:43 I think these are Lu Raises but with Dumbbells, If not, can somebody explain the main difference in the movement?
Do In the last video. Mike said. Stopping at the bottom of the eccentric introduces momentum which makes zero sense. If you know how to train , now Jeff mentions Mike advises pausing on the bottom of the eccentric. Mike get the story straight.
I do powerlifting would doing 3-4 second counts actually help with better quality
I did see a doc about synthol, got that in mind when jay cutler showed up in this clip, because just that era he used synthol to really pop out the shoulders.  That is really disgusting
8:37 Aight got it, do it like a Jew.
1:20 where should I concentrate
Tf do you mean dune is getting its own video game???
First Exercise Sustanon Second Anavar Third Winstrol. Without that there are no really round shoulders sorry natural guys.
Need one of these for bis and tris!
Any alternatives for the reverse pec deck. I dont have access to one
I need to thank both of you for this exercise, today I tried it and had craziest delt pump ever, kudos!
10:43 that body dysmorphia is really like me ngl 😂
Some exercises i have better suggestion
Front Delt 1:22 => 2:24 ; 2:35 =>3:00; Side Delt 4:54; 6:11; Rear Delt 6:55 =>
Holy shit Mike looks massive how do his arms fill out that huge shirt
Just in time for my shoulder and abs day tomorrow, gonna try it
يسوي روحه يفتهم الاثول، مرجع العالم كلهم بكمال اجسام Jeff nippard ، dr mike ينصحون عضلتين ومرات 3 باليوم وبالاسبوع تكون العضلة ممرنها مرتين او 3
my shoulder is my greatest weakpoint asking if how many per week can I do these workouts
"Slow."
Yall are trying to piss off mike lol I see ya
0:52 These people have huge muscles because their body contains more steroids than actual blood.
Front delt exercise 2, rats can i do that but with dumbell? Am too weak for long bars.
3:50 ????
Check out the roid gut on that guy. Just like Rogan. 😬
Never seen Dr in fantastic shape...cock
These guys are like equal opposites except for exercise science and it works. Lol
You guys are awesome! I laugh so hard, Mike is funny.
The BEST part of the video is Dr.Mike being Dr.Mike
So why don't we see the IFBB pro's doing those side laterals up high?
3:44 Mike roasted nippard
is that dana white?
I''m confused, what happened with raising the cable to make a 90⁰ angle with the hand?
2:15 since you asked, it's not. The accent and the gesture are very stereotypical, btw that gesture has a meaning, it means :" what?". Using it like this is silly. Just because you asked, i don't really care and i'm actually Italian, from Italy. Anyways, great video actually, really helped me with my form.
They immediately left the gym together to go pick out curtains.
Some great advise here . I have a basic multi gym set up . I can do upright chest press and lat pull downs , so if I keep up with that I should be good for front and rear delts . I can also do a cross body cable pull so that gets my middle delts covered . I could do the front raise cable and a bent over row or upright row ?   Oterwise , Great !
"Yea, do one from the rear." - these two would be epic as a series
Bahr
To be honest I thought this Mike guy was a bit of an A Hole but I really liked him in this video. Good sense of humor.
Good fucking series
9:16  This edit, making it look like he’s answering Jeff, with Jeff behind him talking to someone else, made me giggle.
Tried them all yesterday, i have some good soreness right now. Thank!
In true fashion of my ignorant mind, Jeff is someone I intensely disliked right of the bat through first impressions, but actually ended up liking a lot.. Just like anyone I am friends with in real life. Whats up with that.. idk but I can pretty much te;; how much I will like someone based of how much I dislike them when first being introduced
I highly doubt that Mike fella is 'natural'..
Dying at 10:40 when Mike see's that huge ass guy and is like "Oh shit" hahahahaha
Why he didn’t finish the sentence about why he not doing barbell overhead presses anymore 😂😂
I work out at home so....shoulder press, lateral raises, and bent over raises right?
3:35 cheeky camera move
Hello, First of all, I'm a huge fan of Jeff Nippard. At the request of Korean bodybuilding fans, I translated and uploaded a video introducing your content. I translated it out of pure fandom, but if it causes any discomfort, please let me know, and I will take the video down. I will always support you!
Why does this look like father and son
One of the best duets) Thank you guys
Thank you so much.
Step one: be five foot two inches
Both are 5'3
10:36😭😭😭😭
Joe Root?
Legendary video!!! More more more!!!
thank you good combo of intelligent people with great senses of humor and shared information. the teaks speak to me.
[04:42] Super ROM Lateral Raise (10 to 20 reps, good control on the negative)
Free Palestine
Honestly I've learned from you so much dare Jeff please keep making good videos like this
jeff, just tried today to increase the range of motion on those exercises as you shown,  felt very good, but i d like to report that I felt the traps a lot. Is that ok? Should I work on the technique more?  Thanks in advance  thanks for these videos and all the free information
10:30 😂
Dude looks like dana whites jacked brother
Solid vid and facts...👍🏽
Jeff nipplehard
How about front delts raises lying on the floor and doing lengthened partials?
IS THAT GUY ACTUALLY THOR?? 😂
T rex arms
You and mike are the best combination pls don't stop making videos together
jeff nipples
what abt mid delts
I thought Dr Mike said training rear delts is a waste of time because of all the attention they get from pulling movements?
De qué sirve tanto ROM si disminuye el brazo de momento? 🤦🏻‍♀️
How many reps with the cross body cable raise
Only video mike  doesnt cuss or swear,  Jeff is really professional when he talks
Please keep it wholesome, Jeff!
I have no front nor rear delts, just side delts...
Best collab yet feed us more
Dr Mike looks gross. He's gotta smarten up and drop the gear.
Could you also do the rear delt cable reverse fly unilaterally?
8:38 like swimming
If I'm getting crunchy shoulders doing any of those medial delt excursuses, what is wrong and what can I do to fix it?
https://youtube.com/shorts/E_LrfSk1rrs?si=ZIZRSwZanoW8suD9  Is this accurate?
Dr Mike is funny😅
1:31 I'd watch this exercise all day
I tried them all and boy am I sore af! Seems to actually reach ramifications of the delts that I didn’t know existed 😅 thanks y’all 💪🏻
There are many number ones - you’re my number one - Jeff didn’t appreciate that romantic gesture nearly enough
even this loose t shirt cannot hide his belly....something has to be done with this modern body building.
Dam I have to say even though I'm late that the rear delt cue dr. mike said actually for the first time let me feel my rear delts on that machine. THANKS
My 2 Go Tos for science based fitness advice. I cannot stress how much these two helped me already within 2 month of getting back to the gym after years of hiatus.
Dr Mike's face: 😠 His character: 😛 Very comical, love it! 😂
Great, I've been wondering how to best train my shoulders and now I know. Only 6 weeks in and aged 60 !
Taint
10:31 that was close.
To be fair your guys' delts look tiny and lame. Gymnasts, Sprinters, NBA players and MPMDates have much better looking delts. Thats all.
This video is so sigma
3:00
Hello, Jeff ! New subscriber to the channel, I know RP channel for few weeks now - and I had no idea you two guys made a clip together. I real feast for knowledge and humor. Would love to see more :)
Can we pick one exercise for every part instead of both?
@7:31 Jeff is all teeth 😂
algun calistenico viendo esto para la hipertrofia de sus deltoides para la plancha
Videshi Mukesh gehlot find 😂
6:23 I call it the Pimpsmack
One of the best workout videos ive seen. Really loving the workouts and methods
why cant i add this vid to a playlist ????
I really do see Dr. snapping on those girls just walking in front of the camera
Love your videos you guys have made. The educational and scientific approach is great!
Man I love Mike and his intelligence about exercising the body, these are golden for me
why did jeffer nippard use light dumbbelles ?
0:55 - just such a weird and unusual looking robot. 4:50 - I just tweaked a muscle near my right shoulder blade. This is my second time doing this exercise, but it did not go smoothly this time. (10lb dumbbells.)
Man, no matter how many videos of Jeff's i see, I'm always amazed by his triceps
are normall dumbbell laterall raises good exercise for ur shoulders?
I keep forgetting Mike and Jeff are the same height. Mike is just a scarier looking 5'5
As a fellow Jew I loved the sweeping up money analogy.
Two of my favs! Keep building all.
It's sad when you use an exercise like this and the gym coach comes to correct you, saying you're doing it wrong. 😢👎
5.1m viewers and the guy is still advocating using machine weights
The smile when Jeff says "I changed my mind"...
I love all the hidden editted gay jokes, which are clearly not jokes.  Dr mike is bisexual at the least and it make him more amazing than he already is. TO BE HONEST.  ONLY ANOTHER MAN CAN APPRECIATE THE MALE BODY IN THESE FORMS.  ONLY MEN APPRECIATE THE WORK ,THE SKILL, THE TIME N EFFORT, AND THE SIZE OF THE MEN.  I WOULD GIVE ANYTHING FOR THE OPPKUTUNITY TO DATE, RAMON DINO, C-BUM, OR DR MIKE..   AMAZING SMART KIND MEN... AND FUCKING SEXY
My front delts are small compared to the others. My chest is my best feature.
you're my number 1 <3
How much reps shoudl we do of weach? 3 or 4?
Thank you for the information.
2:47 For the front delt raises could we do the same exercise but using one dumbbell gripping both sides?
Thanks coach
Two of my favorite coaches!
On the rear delt machine, how far do the set it back?
tbh i couldn't pick you would have to do a full series !
I have never worked my shoulders like this. Thank you gentlemen!  Best part of this is the fact I can alternate exercises if a machine is taken
i feel like mike and I would really get along
8:06
Instead of the money analogy I like to think instead of sweeping and collecting the money, you’re collecting gains
Mike is the guy.
Sorry fellas, "butt", the girl doing the squatts next to you, grabbed all my attention❣️
Good video
5:43 no wayy 💀💀
Don't forget the mushroom head
Phenomenal video
Breast stroke for rear delts....with the wts...
keep the collab! that was great!
Aww nippers such a good little boy he's so clean doesn't even use pre workout.....lol...weasel
Seems like an intelligent guy but that’s a nasty body bro but you look healthy just fluffy 😂
Keep in mind that every raise you do passing the 60º angle of the shoulder flexion will involve more your Serratous anterior and the superior fibers of the traps. 🥂
Yeah, one more from the rear 😂😂😂😂
congrats on 5 mil subs!
What’s your number 1?- Jeff, “You’re my number 1”- Mike
It seems like in every video you do side delt raises different. It’s really frustrating. What is the best way?
Make this a series! ❤
WHAT IS JEFF DOING AT 3:50 😭😭😭
So I’ve noticed my left bicep is quite a bit weaker than my right, how would I go about evening them out a little more
Very good
Close grip behind the head barbell press (upper arm to parallel with floor.. great also for lower triceps), military press (Viking better.. palms facing each other), reverse grip to parallel press, T-bar row... Next day, dumbbell isolation 12
Got some good ideas from this video to incorporate into my weekly lift schedule. Awesome!
This is your best video
Bro I have never felt my side felts until I did the full rom. Thanks dr Mike!!
I see a lot of conversation and talk about how many reps, but I’m curious how many sets are being done, I’m curious for my own workouts
Bro said FULL ROM lateral raises 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 you are a goofy mfer
8:40 jewish ancestry detected.
Just came across your channel very informative. Would you have any videos on how to build massive traps lol.
Gonna need the girl at 1:14 to host an episode.
If I had a dollar for every time Mike asked “is that ok to say?” on Jeff’s channel 😂
This workout had my blood pumping
I hope that overhead press machine does more than just ohp. Otherwise that's like using a grenade to kill an ant.
That bald jacked goofy guy is funny I like him
I hate both of you for the pain you put me through. Subscribed.
Disappointed you collaborate with the massive racist Dr Mike Israetel who has even been admitted he could be a white supremacist and goes on about race science.
seen this right before my shoulder day💪🏽
10:40 random Antoine Vaillant appears
Great collaboration with Dr. Mike for science based training. Very well put together video and might I add great content as well. Just started following you.
I strongly disagree with floor to ceiling lateral raises, absolute rubbish . After shoulder height its all traps
This video has brought so much business to the shoulder orthopedic docs that they have started recommending it.
Ya'll are the only 2 fitness influencers I follow because you're the only ones I trust, and here you are, together, teaching me to become YUGE. Also, Dr. Mike is the best at analogies
Okay  if Mike is taller than Jeff, I am not sure I want to know how tall Jeff is lol
Antoine valliant was the guy doing the Thor hammer exercise
5:43 gotcha
Give us a whole series that would be fuckin 🥜
How long is the rest time supposed to be?
I love how you guys not only give scientific explanations, but also articulate to where it is straight forward - easy to understand advice. Absolutely love these videos. Bravo 🙌
Pure bullshit
If i saw Jeff in my gym I'd be like a groupie 😂
everyone in usa is a doctor :D so comical. the guy is a moron and lying about sterioids
Is he on steroid
Is taking a glycerol supplement safe?
Just did all of these for the first time
I like how the first thing he said was that you don’t need to train front delts, and then the first movement he showed you was how to train front delts.
heartwarming to include your father in your youtube channel
On front delt exercise 2 I only feel it in my rear delts. Any tips to feel it more in my front delts?
Got crossover with Dr. Mike before GTA6
Awesome video, the end is hilarious. I was looking for good delt exercises and this was perfect for me
2:50 Totally stopped paying attention for a minute there.  Sorry.
Does the load curve on the resistance bands best for side delts since you don't need that much load?
Dude I love the last couple minutes you added, great fun
Is the delt the shoulder or is it part of the shoulder?
I don’t believe a single thing that come out of Mike’s mouth. Anyone on peds, no matter how “educated” is automatically disqualified from giving advice.   Also stop telling people to not work the front delt directly because it’s good for physical therapy.
10:31 lmaoooo
Loved the way Dr. Mike explained the movement through an idea of a movement, much easier to understand what we should be doing/feeling
The bar front raise looks an awful lot like a certain boot camp exercise we did with our rifles
Jeff, Your and Mike's channels are my absolute favorites.  No BS (except Mike's jokes.  He thinks he's hysterical) just actual science, motivation and hard work.  (Ok, Fine.  Mike is funny)
This is my favorite instance of seeing Mike in videos in a while low key. Loved hearing about moving the weight
Best exercise is roids, dear god the ingenuity.
Which deck stain does Cutler use?  I'm thinking it's dianabol mahogany
"9:33 you run a wholesome channel so I'll shut up now " 😂
These guys are awesome 😂
Over head press hits them all...KISS...Keep it simple stupid.....Not rocket science
Jeff is so wholesome!
It's so hard to let ego go, and do front and side raises with 10 lb dumbbells.
01:19 i'm really interested in this exercise, i keep comming back to this part
Mike's the best 🤙🏻🤙🏻
The cable lateral raise with the “sword draw” motion is an exercise that actually has a lot of research on it in physical therapy. Essentially these diagonal planes of motion do an incredible job of strengthening the shoulder in all the cardinal planes with fewer exercises. The anatomy of the deltoid is really shaped for this diagonal movement.
5:43   sheeeeeeeesh
If Jeff wasnt such a stand up guy.. Id deffs accuse him of not being natty
Just got the best shoulder bump too🔥
Incorrect
How tall are these guys?
Just what I was looking for guys... 💪👍 Much love from MANCHESTER England.
Jeff, why are you contradicting yourself all the time?  Here you showcase a front raise variation as a great way to build delts, six months later you tell the people in a Jesse James West collab that front raises are a waste of time.
I would watch a series of you and Dr Mike doing a roadtrip, checking out different gyms, foods & just Jared sat in the back seat barely saying a word 😂
Dr Mike is awesome!
Should I do all 3 groups in one day or spread them out?
Damn, everyone at this gym is ripped!
3:51  Wtf iz is jeff nippard doing lmao
I've been getting into the gym alot since the beginning of the year and am watching this massive backlog on amazing information concerning hypertrophy you have available on your channel, and I always love when you and Mike are getting together!
lol camera man "correction" 3:34
This is awesome bro 👍🏾
These exercises destroy the rotator cuff. Don't do them
what if i'd try the front delt raise with dumbbells? woulden't that extend the stretch in comparison to the ez-bar? well i'm for sure not in the position to argue against dr. mike i'm just curious
Great video 🙌
Top 3 exercises. Proceeds to show 6 execrises. My english is bad
Couple of extra short buff dudes
Jeff "raised" a good point front delt raises beyong "here" shoulder height does put unnecessary stress on the joint for what incremental benefit... hurt my joint wouldnt do it again. The taking stuff off a high shelf analogy seems dumb. Is that how you move your arm to take food off a high shelf lol
Very entertaining!!
Omg these two guys together are explosively helpful and funny!
2:14 what did he say?
unilateral means working one side at a time. bilateral is working both side independently but at the same time.
But doing front raises with palm facing down seems contradictory. When doing the side raise when your palm gaves out it's inline with your arm, shouldn't that transfer over to front raises? I feel more front delt with my palms facing inwards when doing front raises.
Just did this today and I can still feel the pump. Great workout!
Big thing about this is these guys mad wanting to train soooooo much more fun. Have muscle but be a human and relatable.
How many exercises are required to maximize growth of the shoulders?
6:16
I loved it.  Slow down!!
I got distracted for a bit due to back ground movements with the first exercise.... but great collaboration, I learned a bit more today.
Nip looks mini juicy
"As if another" is a great que. Watched this video last week and have been using it all this week and it makes a big different!!
01:30 keep focus
I like this bald dude, he's super wholesome! :D
10:32
great tips ngl thank you both👏🏻👏🏻
Tried out all 6 workouts yesterday; hitting each deltoid once before going back to do the other 3. Shoulders aching like mad today. Particularly loved the burn from the Super ROM Lateral Raises. Really great content! Thank you.
I keep thinking this coach is Dana White??!! Surely it’s a relative 🧐
Time of rest between sets?
love his humour
I hear a lot about sitting snd improving stability. Isn't it important to train stability?
So, I tore my bicep doing the front delt exercise 2 after watching this 😅
that bald dude looks like he's on steroids but eats too much crap
My two favorite people in the exercise science/bodybuilding community. Jeff, you’re the man and I love your vids! Recently found Dr. Mike and I can’t stop laughing at his commentaries. You guys are great. Thanks for all the great advice.
If I were to do a shoulder workout with all this exercises, how many reps and sets should I do?
Man I thought dr mike was Kurt angle
Any body else notice the girl checking him out at 2:25
Honestly, all of Dr Mike's cues makes so much sense
Would doing the front raise with a cable machine prove more beneficial?
Best shoulder workout video I've seen. Great info in this one. THANKS
How the heck this man move his arms so far in the lateral raise movement haha!
Short kings meeting space here
Lifting over the shoulder line the weights on the  Lateral raise could cause a rotator cuff tear
Wtf? What are their height?
My impinged shoulders hurt just by watching this. Think I got shoulder bursitis after just 4 minutes  😰
Thanks for this video! I've eliminated some of the exercises I was doing and incorporated some of these exercises again that I did awhile back, because of his video! Very good explanation, also you should do more videos with Mike on all body parts!
Where beast mode came from. I’m only doing muscles that I’ve never done. All back of the body exercises. Gravity is key for cuts
i tried to "paint" the floor as much as i could while doing pec dec reversed for rear delts, it was awesome! Thanks so much for the tip. I document my workouts on my channel and will see that rear delt devopment later and compare it to when i first got your advice. Lets goooo
Neck next?
10 minutes onwards was priceless 😂
Bro is gettin all the info from "juice world" this is hilarious
Sometimes you get lucky in life and get the best of both worlds
I really love the videos of you two swapping notes. I could watch so much of this.
Mike and Jeff are literally carrying all my potential growth on their (pun intented) shoulders in both their separate videos and in collabs. Keep going boys, best gym-related content I experienced on yt.
Love it. Big fan from Scotland
Strong guys nice and funny. Me watch.
Only love for jeff and mike
Jeff and Mike enters the gym and suddenly everybody practice perfect form and slow eccentric like when you see a police car on the freeway😃
Amazing Jeff! This looks like a super cool gym with some unique machines I’ve never seen before. Can you disclose the location please? Assuming somewhere in LA.
super helpful
I got a bench for Xmas, I mostly train at home using power blocks, and I had been doing standing overhead press, but once I tried them seated I was surprised it was more difficult since I assumed the additional stability would actually make it easier, but removing my legs from the equation I realized that I can’t cheat the lift now, very good!
absolutely bullshit exercises ,you guys work more on your traps that delts
Bad ass machine
Hello there Jeff, Ive gone back to some respectable training & what I've learnt thus far my bro is....My work outs are increasingly becoming very respectable. Thankyou for your diagnoses of respectable, dicaplined training.
Both of you are wrong. Wouldn't  be easier just to inject Synthol if you want bigger delts.  😮
Why are men inherently attracted to shapely butts? Is it indicative of a female's ability to run from predators as this would then transfer to their offspring? Logic tells me yes. A video on that would blow up. Cheers!
so many chicks in the gym
I wanna give a quick shout-out to Mike's height, he towers over Jeff like a perverted uncle
I really like shoulder shrugs
🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨
Soy athleta proesional me interesas quiero relacxiones contigo barba.
Why is this video so dark
Mike and Jeff both dedicated their lives to putting on muscle in the gym.. both are 5'2" tall... coincidence? 😂
It'd be lovely to have subtitles both on Your and Mike's videos.
My right arm isn’t developing like my left. Any advice on how I can balance it out. I’ve been doing mostly iso movements
slow!
No advice from a natty, no disrespect but no
Panatta! 🤌🏻🇮🇹
In this industry i think these two are your best bet. Its lifting with intellect and logic and that has always worked best for me.
happy i did it right randomly  lul
Are you supposed to have fully extended elbows like on here? Thats not what ur supposed todo on normal lateral raises?
Wow! The pump from this workout is insane. Something about going over the head with those 2 exercises.
Could you do a video for plyometrics?🙏
Banger video, Jeff nipple
kk
The rear delts with the cables motivation - "I'm Spider-man stopping a train, I'm Spider-man, I AM SPIDER MAN"
Gold!
Gold!
6:35 oh! Its like a single arm Y-raise but with more emphasis on side delts
It's a delightful treat that doesn't need any fussing in the kitchen. One of the best peanut butter out there- Alpino's peanut butter, whether it is natural or chocolate-flavored, is the best!@AlpinoHealthFoods
doc mike needs more ab training imo
Wow, I've learned so much! Thank you 🙏
Legit... wrestler my entire life always been stiff, with  "wrestler strength" but never been "gym weights strong".....   appreciate all these videos      🙏   Respect
I mean this is wow  I have never seen this type of content and shoulder gone say I  am dying😅😅 And Dr mike the legend ❤ I want this type of shoulder workout thank you making 🤗🤗 Love from Pakistan 🇵🇰 Love
Jeff you're the best bro ❤❤
Front delt exercise 1 / 2 Side delt exercise 1 / 2 Rear delt exercise 2
I love you jeff your videos helped me alot in improving my form and learning new variations you are a legend for natty community ❤.
I like how Antoine Vaillant is like an easter egg in this video.
1:32 really good form
Give the Scott Press a try!
That’s what’s up
The pile of $ part showed he is a jew
One of these guys claims to be natty lol.
HE LOOKS LIKE MUKESH GEHLOT (GURUJI)
You two should be on a long form podcast together - Hubermann style. That would be gold
I didn't like this collab, I don't like Mike Israetel at all, when I see things like "super-rom lateral raises" I know science has been thrown out the window. <<It feels natural>>?
Some great advice, I'm really lacking on the shoulders area, training wise, so definitely will add some of this stuff!
Quick peek at 3:36 🔴
Aim for lower than belly button. Shoulder wide grip and 90° to the floor. Pull directly from the floor and then please repeat the video the tutorial could be nice
gymnasts do a lot of dumbells exercises with straight arms, as long as our joints are prepared we are ok imo
Shoulder lateral raise …. Full room not sure
I needed this. Thanks for the video
What if you’re dealing with a shoulder impingement?
1:22 👀
The swole hobbit!
Two dudes I have a ton of respect for
This is so much fun to watch
3D delts = ped use. No other way around it folks.
Once I started watch you and dr Mike my gains have been exponential
Two of my favorite guys in the exercise world together. I would love to see more of this. Great information here! Especially considering I’m trying to blast my Delts at the moment. I’m already making changes because of this video. Looking forward to the results.
I was going far back on my flyes to get a deep stretch and this old guy came tell me I was gonna fuck up my shoulders from it. Think ill trust Israetel.
8:10
5:33
So no overhead pressing needed at all?
Lmao. All this talk about side delts. After cut "so let's start with a random machine targeting the front delts"
front delt lives matter
Did this workout and I can say my shoulders are on fire. Great video!
You’re a better man than me. I kicked over this guys little tripod with his iPhone bc he had all the dumbbells and told me to wait as long as I have to wait bc he didn’t come there to talk to me? Wtf?
Dr Mike is so funny, swimming in money for rear delts had me dying
Nothing beats a face pull for rears
🔥👊
“ as if you’re gonna do another” that should be on a T-shirt
can someone help how whould i implement this in push day with chest and triceps alr it seem oblivious to add that many exercises
Dr.mike is likeable
These cross-body cable raises are AMAZING. I had problems doing conventional dumbbell raises cause it hurts my shoulder, but these don't and they feel so good. Muscle-mind connection goes crazy with these, thanks for the advice
All delts matter!
So, basically do the same exercises we have always been doing.
Ok how many sets of each exercise 😢? Please someone
Arnold did those in pumping iron 4:47
I really want to be able to target the side delts but all of the exercises that I see that target that group would have me doing one version or another of the side lateral raise. I get terrible tennis elbow from side lateral raises.
ez bar front raise is a new one on me, going to go do it right now
so nasally lol
Did the ez bar lift yesterday and my front delts were on fire.   But today my biceps and even lats are sore.  All I did was shoulder work. Did I do something wrong?
That paintbrush point is pure GOLD
short men lol
Just hit all theses exercises and my shoulders are dead💀
He’s a Little Ramy! 😮
This is exactly what I needed. Ive been struggling on gains for my shoulders and I’m definitely not getting enough stretch
11:00 I wish they could turn down the music at my gym too, the spinning sessions are like a freaking disco. I often use ear plugs at the gym to save my ears, and I mean real earplugs for industrial work and not airpods or something like that. It rings pretty loud in the ears when some meat bag next to you is dropping the weight stack metal to metal as if the cable snapped and has no clue about "as if you gonna to another".
Crying because of my shoulders.
"Paintbrush" is my new favorite workout verb.  "You gotta paintbrush harder bro!"  "Do you even paintbrush?"
These exercises really helped me out, thanks both for sharing !
sorry to be the party pooper here, but why 11 min video , when can be just 3 min max.
9:48 “then i have to go home?😢”
That shoulder press machine is insane, looks incredible
EMPANATA
This one was fire dog
Little late to the party here, but that last rear delt exercise, could that be replaced by swimming? Seems like the same range of motion
You guys make up a great team. Two experienced fellas, no BS
Mike’s great. He loves lifting so much, when he blinks it looks like his eyelids are doing a rep.
how many sets for the second side delt exercise
Dr. Mike really knows his stuff I’m regularly sour after following his techniques after not feeling sore for a while.
if you use dumbells, is there a difference between going straight up vs bringing them together at the top?
6:15 4:45
he looks goofy as fuck man
Curious what a full workout looks like for shoulders, especially if focusing 70-90% on side delts
Pause reps are definitely humbling
1:25 damn that's some thickness
Great video !
My two favorite coaches/YouTubers!
just went back from the gym after doing your exercises massive pump man thank you
hi jeff, i watched ryan humiston channel about the middle shoulder. He also talks about shoulder anatomy but his exercises to work the middle shoulder are very different from your exercises. So what do you think?
8:18
Is it ok to do shoulder press like that (1:30)? I would be really worried about my spine if i put this much tension on it without flexing my core and bracing against the bench
The delts do have three main directions in which it moves in the anterior section of the body and posterior section of the body.
Dr Mike reminds me of a mix of Joe Rogan and Dana White lol
How's Jeff so big and so weak, I usually watch Olympic Weightlifter half his size much stronger
thanks
1:19 Damn respectfully
Just finished this - about 1/6 of my normal weight load and I’m lit like never before.
3:50 whats Jeff doing?
Why is Dr. Mike so fuckign cringe
Can't believe these two experts would post this for free on YouTube.
I changed my mind 😂
5:43 ERIKA
Jeff's #1 side delt exercise is basically a D2 flex-extension pattern. Extremely effective at activating all components of the delts, not just the lateral head. We use this movement pattern very often in rehabilitating patients who have hemiplegia from strokes.
standing rows?
This is the best workout video I’ve ever seen. Thank you guys.
Best duo ever, I cant describe how much I appreciate your effort, Thanks champ
Quality video. Merci
That’s right! Have fun! Working out doesn’t have to be boring or mundane.
I'll try the full range with the ezi bar and see what is going on with the shoulders, as done in the video with no weight.  Nobody wants to tear anything in the shoulder area.
Thanks so much for this video, my shoulders are pumped after trying these exercises!  Best they've felt!
This is where I saw the Leonardo da Vinci’s 👏🏼  I start my upper body workout’s with full range of motion Leonardo da Vinci’s .  My shoulders get jacked all the way around ….. I’ll do some with palms up some with Palms down and some side to side.  I get straight up lit. 🔥
Over extending... to contract to that extent = Can lead to Front Rotator Tear... Mike has gotten shit wrong for years, he will tell you that him self.
Last exercise is just how swimming stroke is
Front: - Machine seated - Curl with no elbow bend Side: - Lateral Super Rom - Sword Drawing Lateral Back: - Super Rom Rear Delt  ( diving motion )  ! Cues: Hold in at the last rep
Great pointers on the belts guys
Anyone here remember nigahiga?
Great content, thank you for sharing!
The front delt exercise 2, the weighted front raise focusing on eccentric IS the best exercise for the serratus anterior. This is because its job is to stabilize overhead loads, and the eccentric from overhead position back down to front will give you the full benefit of activating this stabilizer.  This also means those with weak stabilizers/serratus anterior will find this exercise very hard, this will only happen to those who have never trained full extension barbell overhead presses before basically.
Lu Raises has made it 😂
Dr. Mike is hilarious, what an awesome duo
Phenomenal training techniques, can't wait to train next!
Mike has no place talking about any of this stuff being not natty
its funny to see them collab because normally each of their collabs are taller than them.
Mike was trying so hard to keep Jeffs channel monetized.
10:08 a wild Antoine Valliant appeared!
antoine vaillant casually walking by lol
Love this crossover
Mike and Jeff are the best dudes on Youtube for fitness. Please DO another video just like this!
That first shoulder machine looks sweet never seen one
These have totally unlocked shoulders, I am forever grateful.
All these exercises in one session?
Im so jealous of the amout of knowledge you get for the gym for these pros lol Goals!!°
Jeff says dont do lateral raises in pronated position
The last negative advise is gold
0:57 That guy looks like a clown...
But what weights is a beginner (or even intermediate) supposed to use when these huge guys use super small dumbbells or just the EZ bar on some of these exercises?
Dr Mike is 1 big fat burger away from having a cardiac arrest
One of the best shoulders exercises is barbell overhead press. I am surprised that it wasn't presented
How much does Jeff weigh? He looks small outside of frame from Mike but then when both in shot he's almost as big as Mike!
Are you guys Canadian?
Is one exercise per muscle group not enough? I do 4 sets of Shoulder press, Cable lateral raise, Reverse pec deck. Shrugs.
Great stuff, felt excellent
3:35 i saw this sway @cameraman
1:22 wow that's huge
Hahahaha 10:54 underwear in hes buttcrack. Almost a thong
What made you draw the conclusion that side delts are clearly the most important? That was just an opinion from Mike. There’s no specific evidence saying that rear delts are less important. And I’m not sure if it’s reasonable for him to conclude that back training alone should just take care of rear delt growth sufficiently
Definitely going to pure muscle fitness when I visit from Auz 🇦🇺
No editing effort in this video, no titles, numbers Nothing. Useless, fucking lazy.
0:11 anyone wanna talk about how they have a combined Hight of 8 foot?
10:40 It's a wild Antoine sighting!
I have incorporated dr mikes slow negative where I count to five and pause at a deep stretch. I have gained more strength and mass then I have before. My man knows his shit. Enjoy the videos and the knowledge
was that a random Antoine Vaillant sighting? lmao
Hey great video. It's nice to know that Dr. Mike can actually dispense his knowledge without acting like a perverted vulgar 14 year old...
i really thought Jeff killed Dr. Mike with that sword 😂
1:03
0:37
4:42
9:32
9:04
8:13
7:05
6:16
5:11
Ryan humistons video is more informative imo
that first flex down looked like two gigantic little boys puffing themselves up
All Dr Mike's exercises do good stretching and contraction but they don't look like you could progressively overload tham over time but maybe that's just me
*training rear delts is overrated cause when you train your back they be well developed too* I've never this one. Suddenly I feel better about my technique when it comes to my rear delt training 😮
is what "i" call "Super-ROM Lateral Raise" ..  Come on Doc ... it's already called **Lu Raises** 🤷🤦‍♂
Front  -Seated machine shoulder press (or seated dumbbell) -EZ bar front raise (or free cable machine)   Side -Super ROM lateral  -Cross body cable y raise   Rear  -Super ROM reverse cable fly  -Reverse pec deck
Awesome tips. Also, all the chicks in the background are jacked!
When it comes to super ROM lateral raises, is it better to go from a pronated grip to a neutral grip to get the ROM or is it better to change the shoulder angle forward? The ROM is impossible if I don't do either.
I just simply can't get my arms that high on a Super ROM lateral raise without putting thumbs up at the end 🤷
It’s all about the roids
Don’t think many people want to look like guy in the white t shirt
When I do shoulder press I feel it in my triceps so I wonder what im doing wrong
It is always about the little things. Consciousness and being in the moment, focusing is the key.
@3:35 i saw that camera man, and i understand.
THIS! is good content.
What are the three ?
Casual Antoine Vaillant cameo @10:10
So cool that jeff still learning even tho he knows so much
but did jeff change his workout routine?
What I really want to know is, not what exercises to do for shoulders...I want go know how to PROGRAM them.  I know to do lateral raises.  But do I progressively overload them, like with pressing?  Or do I just do them to failure every time
At home I do this upside down against a wall at different angles, probably not as effective as gym machine maybe but still does a decent job and I’ve seen changes to my shoulder.
Mike practically schools all these fitness gurus in the reels 😮 these othere people aren't college professors with a degree and that says something
I always get great results with pecs but not delts. Hopefully this video might help 😊 P.S. Is it just me or is working and building delts significantly harder?
I hate the pain but I also love it. It's a complicated relationship.
Love how at 10:28 jeff says hit one from the rear and Dr mike glances over at the girls ass💀💀😂😂
More content with Mike! You guys have great chemistry on camera
Great vid with awesome info from both of you.  And that's a dope gym to have them help out with the vid.
Why do I feel the cross body y raise in my rear delts?
definetely doing it tomorrow
Mike Israetel: 70-90% of your delt volume should be side delts Me: Skips to 4:46
Do more of these :D
Just randomly meeting Antoine Vaillant
Just done this workout and ive never felt so much stretch in so long. Thank youuy❤❤
👍👍🇪🇸🇪🇸🇪🇸💪💪💪
Ine thing I notice was them cheeks at 1:23 mark 🍑🤫
Do the side delt cable movement with a cuff around your wrist instead of gripping a handle.  Thank me later.
eccentrics hurt the muscle
Awesome. Will start today
AV spotting at 10:42. Dr Mike, Jeff, AND AV in one vid.   Jeff sees AV and puts sleeves back down is so classic
Shoulder training with Keebler elves
Our world is a 3d world even a thin layer of paper is 3d I dont get what this means
This needed Dom Mazetti to but in.
Yeah you two are a dope pair. Mike is awesome
Thank you. 💪
I've been doing all this lol so proud of mah self
I love how everyone else is doing the front raises nowadays for chest when it’s always been for front delt!!!!  Just cause you’re squeezing your chest during a front raise doesn’t mean your chest will grow lol!!!!
Definetly trying this.
Side delt exercises 1 = Lu Raises
I don't do the EZ-Bar Front raise with the hands facing up, I feel like that's activates my upper chest way more on the concentric action............. actually, I guess you're right. Upper chest/Front delt I guess could be synonymous. I usually do this exercise with my hands facing down.
Dr. Mike is the best. He's the epitome of an anti ego lifter.
it´s madness and i hate it and it stretches like crazy.. and then the whole thing starts again, sounds beautiful to me :D
Love Jeff n mike... pt been under a bit of family stress so these guys have been massively helping me mix things up
the "Thor" guy is Antione Vaillant!
dude mike is so cool good balance of jokes and seriousness
Man, I wish I had access to a gym like this one.
5:43 Ob du meine Arbeit für richtig hältst, ob du glaubst, dass ich fleißig gewesen bin, dass ich gearbeitet habe, dass ich mich in diesen Jahren für dich eingesetzt habe, dass ich anständig meine Zeit verwendet habe im Dienste meines Volkes. Gib du jetzt deine Stimme ab, wenn "JA", dann tritt für mich ein, so wie ich für dich eingetreten bin.
Dr. Mike says you are his no.1 and bro skipped him conpletely 😂❤️‍🩹
Jynxzi's dad
Straight baddie at 1:22.
3:33  To the camera man.  STAY FOCUSED BROTHER!!! 😂🤣
I wanna verk owt wiv Dr Mike too😭
Jeff and Mike is the Collab we all need!!!
I love the pec dec machine... I sort of imagine I'm swimming through air, yes it's not a pull
❤❤
YES 💪
I do delt exercises in 1:1:1 ratio because front and rear are important in compound movements, so i dont want them to be a limiting factor
I like that they're the science nerd buffs when it comes to bodybuilding scene youtubers!
best short kings
I love Dr Mike!!
I love Dr Mike!!
That trainer looks like if the Metallica's bassist Robert Trujillo would shave his head and face.
Finally controlling the negatives a little more, coincidentally when I started watching Mike and Jeff again, and am enjoying the progress. I really love the cues to help remember how to stretch most effectively during that lift. Will be using the reaching for money on reverse flys
Never move in a way that forces your joints to do weird stuff. Especially bad when your muscles are near failure.
3:51
Dr Mike knows his stuff eh
Imagine taking gear only to end up looking like Mike. Damn.
Jeff, give Mike tips on growing a beard. Him and I both have the G.D. bowling ball shape...
This was bloody great. Be good if you guys can do more body parts. Good to split them up. Ie. Jeff's one session and mike's the next shoulder day.
Wait, how else do you do a pec dec fly? I’ve always felt like I was doing it wrong due to my shoulder issues, but getting decent results anyway. According to the video I’ve been doing basically the best form, completely outstretched? Always makes me feel so weak. Crazy
Definitely changing up my shoulder routine.now!, thank you both💪
Going to give these a go in shoulders tomorrow 💪🏽
Sorry but did that and the muscle contraction is not good
5:43
Only with Mike, forget you
On the pekdek both forward and rear facing i like to have the seat high and my grip low for 1 set, then i move the seat to the middle height and have a middle grip for 1 set, then i have the seat at the lowest setting and a high grip for a set then i go back to the high seat.
Great exercises
This is one of the best training videos I've ever seen. Ever. Like your boy @coacheugeneteo, the moves are explained well and thoughtful choices. Epic content.
Nice!  Going to try this routine next week!
I cant do any shoulder lift without crunchy joints, can someone help me?
cameraman caught slipping at 3:36
I’m doing the full rom lateral raises for the first time right now, and my shoulder pump is wild
5:43 😂
Does anyone have a break down on dr.mikes gear break down at his age wuld be awsome ,he looks in excellent shape for his age nice a full
What an awesome video
Get help junkie
I think momentum also plays a role here. When you have very long arms the momentum is different compared to a person like you two. I can almost scratch my knees when my arms just hang down relaxed...like an ape. If I did that side-delts exercise with dumbbells, my joints hurt instantly.
I want to do these shoulder exercises asap 🔥
The whole "bring the last rep down like your going to do another one" is an absolute GEM piece of advice. I've been making more effort to do it and it really feels like it's making such a difference. Really took a lot from this video.
8:25 i started doing that in my most recent workout and is a game changer, i used to feel that exercise way more on my middle traps than my delts, but thinking about having your hand as wide as possible really emphasizes the rear delts
I was born with 3D delts so none of these workouts apply for me
WiTh ScIeNcE 😂
If you lean forward at the hips, about 45 degrees, while doing dumbbell side raises. It's safer for the shoulder joints. It also points the middle delts up towards the ceiling, directly opposite gravity, and the path of the weights as they go up and down.    Keep a slight bend in your knees, go light and don't round your back.
Hello, what do you think about Lateral raise machine with elbows at 45°
Mere ko laga guru ji hai😂
Innovation nation of bodybuilding
@jeffnippard if no one’s said it bro- I’m hear to encourage you, go grab your doctorate   You deserve it.   Doesn’t have to be a PhD it can be a DHSC or something where you receive credit for how you synthesize the data you’re currently and constantly reviewing for us  I think you’d appreciate the experience
It’s wild how well Jeff’s natural physique stacks up with Mike’s enhanced
Jeff never use the ball on a cable machine, that's why they break, they are designed to have handles and the ball prevents lateral strain on the cable
love this channel
Any alternatives for rear delts if you don't have cables or a reverse pec dec?
mike needs t-shirts that say "as if youre gonna do another"
Trying those barbell raises for the front delts as we speak. Wow😂
Great vid
Dr. Mike is the Tom Hanks of bodybuilding
Great content
lot of nice asses in that gym
good colab
The most wholesome I’ve seen Dr mike. It’s so weird
I'm trying to get the @ of all the girls in the background :')
Would love to see some content on delt growth with a shoulder impingement
👍
8:08 can tell Mike and Jeff don't swim. Haha. This is a swimming motion my dudes.
This is fucking awesome because this is also very possible with light shoulder pain
6:43 The 'Super-Rom Reverse Cable Flye' was used by IFBB Pro Jay Cutler during his Mr. Olympia days as seen in One Step Closer 2006 (the year of his first win). It is a superb rear delt finishing movement requiring minimal weight as noted by Dr. Mike. There are a few variations of this exercise out there. For example, Hunter Labrada does it slightly differently. This exercise will likely be a permanent part of my training program so long as there is access to a cable machine.
love this, great information but you guys have chemistry; imma watch all your videos together!
Best collabs ever im so fr
I´m not sure if i´m doing the excercises right, because I often feel my neck in the movements. I have the feeling that I´m training my neck more than my shoulders
What do you do if you have a constant pinch nerve on the rear delt + Clavicle pain if there anyway around this ?
Jeff was so excited by the powered by ice cream comment 😂😄🫡
Keep these collabs with Mike going on. I love your combined energy
Really wish my appt gym had cables :'(
Said rear delts are overrated 😮‍💨
10:40 is that Antoine Valliant just casually walking by in frame? 😂😂
7:35 "Its easy there" mmm idk chief....
Physiciel Elliot over here
Thanks Coach, I have added these to my shoulder days.
i literally need more dr mike off camera
looks good :))
Step 1: be under 5'7 in height
As someone who has destroyed his junk with dumbbells, the pinch is real! 😂 You just gotta pay more attention.
There aint a magical exercise guys. If there was everyone would be doing it getting the same results. Work your ass off and be the sweatiest dude in the fuckin gym. Boom. 3D delts.
The sweet baby boy essence of Jeff juxtaposed to Mike's shenanigans should be a monthly segment
Do you think they've ever explored eachother's bodies???
The money analogy was fucking hilarious I absolutely adore these dudes HAHAHA
Almost every video I've seen on shoulder exercises instructs not to go beyond shoulder height for stuff like lateral raises and front raises because it'll fuck up your shoulder in the long run but I see in this video they go for a crazy ROM that goes against that theory. Can someone tell me if doing the exercises like this will cause injury in the long run?
Do these guys have a Youtube video for Arms?  This shoulder video was really good!
If u want 3D delts u need test tren eq and gh in your blood.
This was helpful
I need a schedule with this lol
Bro the free trial pack of 2 weeks is not working help me
I'm sick in bed, setting up a new trainingsplan and all I wanna do right now is to try exactly those 3 exercises… Super nice video. Loved it!
Hola Jeff Nippard I want  your YouTube channel in Spanish version, Please man 🍺🤨
One of the best shoulder pumps I have ever had came from this workout.
Jesus christ, the ladies in the background though....
Yeah yeah f*cking Jeff Nipples.
Жим в блоке сидя, поднятие грифа перед собой вверх, разведение гантелей через стороны вверх над головой, отведение троса в стороны, кросс  отведение назад прямые руки стоя , отведение назад в блоке сидя руки прямые
Nice
There would be so many nswf word bubbles on mike during this lol
Hello Jeff, I like so much your informative videos, besides the existing knowledge they are soo fun .. please could you make a video where you present all the alternative of machines .. if we don't have them for exemple in our gym thank you ❤
is there any alternatives for reverse pec deck?
I might be able to say that this is a perfect video.
One more? Yeah i'll do one from the rear! 🤨
all the hot gym babes are at one gym ..?
Should give details on what position the seat arms and elbows should be for perfect form
Just wanted to ask what would be a good resting time between sets?
My gym sucks
Having 5 times bigger front delts doesn't mean too much volume for the front delts but too few sets for the other heads...
Calves 😉
why listen to a coach who isnt natty?
Great video, tried all this morning and haven't had a pump like that in ages 👍
cheers! I want to ask about the front raises with ez bar.. in this corner of the arm we don't have a big activation of the biceps??
Tremendo contenido !!!!
What about reversing your grip on that ez bar front delt exercise to hit the side delt more?
We're getting called fake natties with this one
I actually have to disagree with mike here, not cause he’s insanely wrong or anything. As we know mike tends to preach a lot about the eccentric and deep stretch portions of the movement and with an ez bar front raise you can’t get a deep stretch because there is no force pulling the weight other than gravity which only affects or traps at the bottom of the movement. So instead you can do front raises on a cable to have tension wherever as well as get a proper deep stretch.
You better not be in a prision cell with Mike lol
Rad colab. Thanks guys
Couldn’t you just step away from the weights to get the same stretch without having to pull towards the back of your body? Lol
At 1:40 talking about "huge range of motion and great stretch".  All while doing HALF reps while spouting that nonsense.
These Super-rom lateral raises are pure gold. I have never felt my side delts this much.
Trying the Dr.Mikes side delt rase but when I’m coming down I keep feeling a pop near or in my rotator cuff. I am trying to keep my thumbs from going down and I and locking my shoulder blades together. Any help so I don’t feel that popping?
Lmao.  We already know who dr Mike is.
I've struggled finding the right shoulder exercises for me but adding some of these has resulted in some of the best shoulder workouts I've ever had super grateful.
Reverse cable fly is also really nice to do with a resistance band
Nice. Have a sub.
Great video. Love Dr. Mike
he's jokes
I had done all those exercises I only have a problem with the Full ROM lateral raises I always feel a slight pinch in my shoulder I’m also  have hypermobile joints so I need to be very so I quite have to modified to simple scaption
We need more Big Brain Lifting Videos...These Bozos in the gym need REAL GYM content..DONT GET ANY better than this. Love you both Dearly! Fitness Legends
Yes!!!! Dr. Mike is outstanding; raunchy as hell, often hilarious and an incredibly effective communicator. His channel is f*** amazing!
Are Facepulls any good for rear delts ?
0:11 they look like midgets lol!
You lock your elbows when doing the ez bar front raise?
I was wondering is it ok to hit front, side and rear in the same day or space it out and that goes for every other muscle as in monday hitting shoulders, back and arms
People still think this guys natural?
M
Beginner here, I always feel like I over emphasize my shoulders when I lift.  So my chest exercises often show results in shoulders.  Been lifting for 4 months and shoulders are by far my most developed muscle.  How can I fix this?  I've totally stopped shoulder exercise at this point.
I’m going to disagree regarding the front delts. I think the front delts are like the calves to a degree. The calves will get activation in a bunch of exercises but they are not the primary mover therefore they don’t stimulate the primary growth. Secondly I’ve never seen someone with Death Star shoulders that didn’t workout their front delts. You can have big shoulders by targeting your side delts but like the rears, they cap the shoulders for that aesthetic look so many desire.
who doesn't love mike !! Good thing tomorrow is shoulder day !!
what about if you don't have a rear pec deck or a dual station cable tower?
Try sitting sideways on the pec dec, then you can get a extremely good stretch on the delts
Mike's side delts raises reminds of Lu Raises (Lu Xiaojun, olympic weightlifter, does it for warmup)
Mike gave me ginormous Matt Serra energy. I love it!!! XD
First side delt exercise looks good for getting an impingement quick
Unbeatable duo
I have to go thumbs up just for the decline of the side raises or else my right shoulder clicks  when I pass through about 10 degrees above horizontal
"Constant tension" doesn't mean no pause.  "Constant Motion" is what I feel Jeff meant.
It would seem that this awsome gym is in my town. Had no idea whatsoever, and plan to check it out. Thanks guys. great content.
Thank you! 🌻
Lol.. the cameraman @ 3:34 “hello.. oh wait shit this is going on YouTube”
DO LAST NEGATIVE AS IF YOU'RE GOING TO DO ANOTHER IS CLASSIC MIKE MENTZER, HE TAUGHT THIS YEARS AGO
Is that Antoine Vaillant?
Very useful video Jeff - thanks! 👍
*gasp* “Is that guy actually Thor? Sweet.”
Would you recommend working all 3 sides in a session (2-3 times per week) OR focus on 1 side per session ( 3 times per week)? Any info helps!
The Thor guy is Antoine Vaillant…
I got a tennis elbow from these lateral raises ⚠️
I loved this video, it helped me so much. Thanks for the tips
Dr. Roidmonkey
It would be more helpful to learn your steroid protocol.
I do the cable reverse flys one handed to really stretch my arm across my body on the eccentric.
1:57 that’s a dope machine!
Damn good exercises. I LOVE shoulder training and do tons of variations to hit them from every angle and I still learned a lot. Especially that cable rear delt with the extra peak contraction at the back and the mind blowing EZ bar front delts with full ROM! Holy cow! I am already a fan of the LU raise (full ROM DB Side raises) but I was turning my hands like Jeff was to tough the sides of the DBs, so I'll try to be stricter now. Great content as always and loving the collaborative stuff! Really good.
Two of my very favorite fitness creators together. I love this
Can i do all of these with dumbbells, cos i only have dumbbells? I'll do it and come back with my findings.
There are many #1’s you’re my #1🤣
Great workout and super fun to watch!!
6:44 is there any other exercise that could replace this
4:37 jeff isnt w the gay shyt
With his drawing a sword analogy, i like to think of it as cranking a lawn mower lol!
How many sets a week should I do for shoulders? And can I train then 3 times a week or should I stick to 2 like all other muscles?
Best delt video ever made.  Nice work
Mike ❌ Mukesh Gahlot 💯💪
Awesome video Jeff, thank you
very wholsome
Love how Dr. Mike always disses on SARMS etc and acts like nothing works except his methods. Anyone with knowledge in the industry can see he is on gear and it becomes obvious what his methods are lol. Nonetheless he is an intelligent trainer and uses science and studies to research the best ways to grow so I appreciate that.
I love Dr. Mike's personality lmao dudes hilarious
How did you know it’s shoulder day
John meadows  . Rear delts
Great advice. I'll do these excerises. And take steroids, if you really want to look like these freaks.
Great video. Thanks
Hagrid and harry potter
10:08 was that Antoine Vaillant?
"Do One More"? Yeah One More From The Rear, That Head Turn Was Fire... Like "What"
***** PORN WARNING - at :10 ultra explicit orc/troll pose-off. Nausea alert!
Love this. Just found both of you this past week or so, (and bought your book!). As a life-long lifter (early teens to late 40s), who took some time the last few years, I am stoked to shock the system, and make some fresh gains implementing your tips. THANK YOU
bro wtf am i watching, all of this is seriously wrong in every way and they will not actually get u a ''3d delts''
Question is, why does dr take roids?
This!  Dr. Mike is great and the two of you together is simply outstanding!
love all your videos!  I definitely agree to maintain neutral or externally rotated arms when above 90 degrees of shoulder flexion to prevent potential shoulder issues if someone is prone to them
Tried the lateral dumbbell raises as part of my warm up, the results killed me. Tightened the hell of my lateral deltoids to the point that i could not hit it my heavy sets. Great new exercise for the end of your shoulder workout. Looking forward to more training videos.
Dont recommend those moves for side delts, to protect rotator cuffs.
7:48 Yeah, I think I'll pass on this one😂
We want one exercise each for all 7 heads Jeff
Dude's head grew like Joe Rogan so you know he's juiced.
Watched this last night, and at the gym today, I’m realizing how many times I don’t set myself up for doing one more. Thanks, guys!
i guess at some age you dont care about the gut anymore
Ah yes, training 7 different delt fibres in isolation exercises👌
Super noob to lifting, but should I add these to a push day or a pull day?
Awesome video!!!  Validated some things I thought I knew and learned a few more that I didn't know.  What's not to like? :)
I did the super ROM and my left shoulder exploded 😢
"well i would get it but i dont want to be crippled for life" fucking hilarious 😂😂
I tried that super ROM side lateral raise with only 5lbs till failure and it ends up being absolutely brutal
This was a fun change of pace for a video from you. Thanks lads
The camera man at 7:35😂😂 well done
Great video, goodbye delts
I'm confused. I thought you're supposed to lean slightly forward when doing the dumbell lateral raise with the arms not totally parallel to the side delts? Also, the extra stretch with the reverse curls may cause joint injury. 🤔
Just the fist exercise on this vid told me how weak you are. You have over a million fallowers yet u are a weak person. And this is not me saying cuz I just watched your first clip. It’s beeen years year u seem really weak n you take your shit that seriously wow
so if you are doing front and side delts on a push day should i just ignore doing standing shoulder presses?
Mike is huge 💪🏻
Step 1. Be ripped everywhere else
Swimming motion everywhere !!! ❤
I mean arms, right?
normally on the side delt exercise 1 i would feel a little pain in my shoulder, what ive been doing is to use an incline bech, to incline my body, so while my thumbs are up the effort is still hitting the side delts. i think i made myself clear jeje, nice video btw
Pumped up Peck
How tall is this guy?
My side delt is 5x the front. Please help!!! No joke, i can't find a way to stimulate it.
Face pulls tho?
Please do more of these it helped so much with me optimising my shoulder workout
This is more than 3 exercises
"paintbrush" is an extraordinary description for the reverse pec dec. I can perfectly picture in my mind how that would go.
Lmao what is Jeff doing at 3:50
Absolutely loved this video!  Very detailed.
Did this workout and I can safely say it was one of the best shoulder workouts I’ve ever done, for context I’ve been training for over 10 years.
Tried Mike’s read delt technique… Thank you I’m dead now
Thank you for the very helpful tips and for focusing on the subtle yet crucial aspects of the exercises. I can't wait to try them
Does he have autism
Just wanted to say thank you for this video. A lot of the workout videos i see on here feel like I’m getting told “ I am this size because of this exercise” when you instead incorporated the science into why these work. Subscribed as well and i cant wait to watch future vids. GOOD STUFF MY BOY
the two nicest guys in the industry
So I'm 6'3 and my gym is in the basement, can I get away with doing a seated version of the standing workouts you showed, aside from the cable pulls? Just wondering if there are any major negatives to this.
1:24 sorry all the tension is being redirected somewhere else
Thank you this helped a lot
I feel like i might need a trainer because as amazingly detailed as Jeff's videos are, I'm having a hard time keeping and understanding it all. Guess it's more encouragement to keep trying.
Great video & deep knowledge from the both of you well done!
I love it every time Jeff and Mike collaborate.
How much front Deltoids involvement do you have doing full range of motion dips?
Amazing content! Just so much value in here. It feels like this the kind of thing you will just be eager to pay for but here it is for free for everyone. Going for delts exercise today and man I'm glad I found this video. Now I'm curious for the next routines that I will be changing based on the discussions you two are having. Please keep it up. I'll be following you both on your channels. Cheers!
I watch/follow a lot of fitness influencers, including Dr. Mike, and this is one of the best exercise demo vids I've ever seen. Love to see a vid on bis/tris. Thanks Jeff!
Big dude looks like DOPPO OROCHI the GOD HAND! Great guy. Thanks for the advices <3
Watching you and Mike do videos together is easily my favorite fitness category on YouTube
@JeffNippard please do more videos like this with Dr. Mike. Do them for other body parts.
please do more videos with mike, this was great!!!!!!
Mike’s 2nd exercises is essentially a Lu raise
Seriously, that's the best shoulder exercise video I've seen. Period!
camera man got carried away at 3:35
I've come back to the comments to say I shoulders today and holy shit the EZ bar front rise he wasn't wrong in saying goodbye delts, those are insane, next I'll try with the cable move  Thanks
Do bricks float?, yes little plastic ones!
I first heard that reverse pec deck cue from a super old Alberto Nunez video! That's the video I always send clients. Mike and Jeff is always a great combo
Antoine jumpscare at the end there
Dr. Mike seems so chill to workout with ❤
This is the sort of fitness videos that deserve to be on this platform  coz there's way to much shit on here. I'm an old school lifter age 50 and I love watching videos done by you two, the indepth explanation of the moves is gold. I will be doing shoulders today and was going to do my free weight standard routine but not today I'll be incorporating all of this.  Thank you  I'll go and look if you've done more videos on other body parts like this shoulder video 🙏👍💪
Constant tension can be achieved even with pausing. It seems that whenever anyone that doesn't implement pausing and controlled eccentric movement, gets "humbled" pretty fast when training with Mike. It's okay to say that you let your ego stop you from implementing Mike's brilliant tips. Hey, but you look amazing, so🤷🏻‍♂️
Awesome video🔥
"scientific credibility" 😂🐑
This is the first that I’ve seen the promotion of raising lateral raises above the shoulders. I feel every other trainer says to stop at shoulder height, because going higher just puts all the stress on the traps with minimal stress on the shoulder. I’ll give it a try..with much lighter weight
Unless you're an advanced lifter, and even then, individual exercises for the one muscle are debatable on how much you can sculpt them. But for beginners and intermediate bodybuilders. Work on your chest and back, progressively lifting heavier for 4 to 6 weeks before having a one or two week break (deload) and your arms, including the delts, will look after their self. Same advice for the core and bottom half. Heavy squats and/or heavy leg press and your calves, hamstrings, gluts and core will develop at the same rate of your thighs. And I'm not saying these exercises don't work because they do. But you would need 4 to 6 hours a day free to spend in the gym. Which most people don't have. Plus, unless chemically assisted, you'll be seriously fatigued after 4 days and then need a week or more off before you step into the gym again.
Why is the super-rom lateral preferred by Mike over the cross-body cable (lateral) raise for side delts since it would seem the latter  has much more stretch under tension than the former?
This was awesome! Please do more for other muscle groups.
I feel like I can critique a lot of misconceptions in this video, but I'll just stick to one... The extra Rom in the "Super Rom Lateral Raise" is unnecessary... The Elbows shouldn't go above the Shoulders because then the Upper Traps start to get Engaged needlessly...
the last clip of random gym bullshitting was so good
That was magnificent! You guys define synergy. It's 1+1=3. You need to do more videos together. Dr. Mike is an expert and so are you. It's not just the workout, but also the way you guys express yourselves. We neeeed moooreee
#INDIA 🇮🇳
I see you, camera guy at 3:36 😂
More of this!
Thank you for introducing me to Dr. Mike I need these very insightful tips and sense of humor!
Mike is a God...  Great epesode.  nice work Jeff.
Dr Mike is the shit. I was thrilled to see that he was in one of your videos.
I wish I could afford to have him as a personal trainer . My life would be so much more … painful
Love this combination. More of you both please. Great content.
anyone else changing the way they been doing rear delts foreverrrrrr ....dammm
I want more videos with Jeff and Dr Mike!!! I love their dynamic, they're so cute together. Built like tanks but squishy personalities.
You get beans out of a cuboard not barbells
I love the ending. So wholesome to see you guys together.
Get yoked bro
Did Mike catch a cold? His voice is less deeper
Jeff I just recently got into your videos and your form and control is next level. I'm about 6 months into my journey and I love every minute of it. Cheers and much love from Cali!
Dr Mikes app I hear is very good too. His channel is also such an essential resource.
Her thighs are huge
Shit I feel like I should have to pay for this; amazing tips
I appreciate that you show good exercise . Mike is fine. I appreciate  that he is polite and to the point.❤
Love these collab videos with Dr. Mike you two have great chemistry
As a woman with breast implants that get wonky with chest work my anterior delts have been as flat as my old boots. This EZ bar front raise is changing my...front delts.
dude that shoulder press machine looks sick
wtf the front shoulders hit different
jeff seems chill
Great video! Loved the content and especially Dr. Mike's tips.
I’m gonna try this workout today
Top 3 The Best Delta   1. HGH 2. Trenbolone 3. Equipoise
No one gives a crap about the science😂😂😂😂 just work hard with a good mind to muscle connection consistently🤷‍♂️🫡
Hes actually centrist mike mentzer
These guys seems like the muscle science version of Rick and Morty, love it. Regards from Chile!
You sound like a virgin
I just turned 60 last month and have been working my ass off for the past 11 months and have lost 90lbs and put on a really good amount of muscle at the same time.  It helps getting the compliments that I have been getting from people in the gym and they are surprised to hear that I am 60 yrs old.  I believe that my success at being able to build as much muscle as I have along with losing the weight is because of listening too Mike awhile back about technique and how he emphasizes a slow negative or return on my exercises.  Also being able to be so successful with the diet part of this I actually probably have lost too much too quick and now I have loose skin below my belly button and a bit under my arms.  With constant lifting and cardio I have been able to fill in those areas so the loose skin is beginning to go away.  That last 5 points of fat loss is the toughest, especially at my age!  After following Mike on technique it's amazing watching how many guys in the gym that have piss poor technique.  You would think they are off to the races or something.  It's a great feeling when you know others are talking about you and how much you have advanced from back where you started.  I look at people like Paul Sklar and I know I can get to look close to that because I'm willing to put in the work to get there, plus I know that as long as I keep following the discipline of technique when I lift then I will reach the goals I set out for myself.  Thanks Mike!!
Insanely good video Jeff with big Mike ! Do some more!
0:44 I don’t agree with this statement.  As someone with a very big genetic disadvantage with rear delt, they haven’t grown at all from any of my back exercices. It may grow well for people that have good delt genetics, but from most people I see at the gym and from my own experience, without any isolation work of the rear delt, there aren’t a lot of results.
These guys always make me look forward to getting back in the gym and improve my training
Awesome video guys, thank you!
the white shirt guy looks like a barrel
Antione valiant makes a wild  appearance
Slayed per usual
Thanks!
Dr. Mike's head vein makes it look like he's always wearing sunglasses on the back of his head
thank you dr mike and jeffrey
Doug Brignole . Is he underrated or overrated ?
I love pause reps. I use them in almost all exercises I do.
I like Dr mike. I'd sure like more. I'll start doing these next year to change my routine for growth. Ty Mr Nippard. I appreciate your content very much so. God bless and keep these videos coming. You look fantastic and the hard work shows.
I'm just getting into weight training, and I'm starting to think I'm going to need to split my “exercise” playlist into individual muscle groups. This is great stuff.
I am ABSOLUTELY LOVING these collabs with Dr Mike
This video is incredible your teaching points here can transition to any lift that you do in the gym. Thank you guys.  I just picked up a few new shoulder exercises to implement every week
Jeff bringing the heat with this video
Best Muscle brains tandem out there
Love you both.
Dr MIKE is the GOAT!!!
Love this duo!!!!
Dynamic duo there! Good info all around!
Why??!! Haha Out of all the shoulder videos here lately out there, Jeff's video here gets me the most pumped to go work shoulders lol 😆
Lat Pull downs and Rows hit the Rear Delts.  Inclined Chest and Flies hit the Front Delts. So add side Delts with the Lateral raise and hit them all.  :)
wow, this is amazing, I actually do all of these based on intuition while trying to heal a chronic shoulder injury... score!  The cross cable pulls feel awesome...
I'm 9 years old and gay and I love this content. My shoulders are burning.
Would doing one arm Super ROM Reverse Cable Fly be effective given limited home gym equipment? Or is the benefit only when doing both arms together?
I hate when gyms play music loud.  Does anyone enjoy it?  Everyone has headphones on listening to their own music but now they have to crank it up to drown out the crappy tunes the gym is blasting.
I've been watching a bunch of body building content, and I started to realize a TON of them were from Canadians. So I looked it up; in Canada you can get anabolic steroids prescribed by a doctor. Which means if you know someone who's "cool" they will write you a prescription for them. Things makes SO much more sense now, especially in regards to Alex Leonidas. Naturally enhanced is the name of his premium fitness program that he sells. Lol, what a troll.
The exercise Jeff uses for mid deltoids is very similar to a PNF pattern (D2 extension if I'm not mistaken) It would make sense from a neuromuscular view point. Maybe something to look further into?
Soo With the front felt raise Does it have to be solely in that sagittal plane or can it veer more into the scaption plane. Also, if you don't have an EZ bar, what is best grip to perform the motion? Pronation, supination, or thumbs up neutral?
You guys are awesome together 😂
Jeff should work on his chicken neck...
@6:27 it really shows both of thems are just kids in a jacked body. Which honestly is a compliment.
Dr mike teased jeff into not pulling his sleves up 😂😂❤
I thought I had shoulder exercises figured out until I tried the stuff they did in this video. My shoulders got so pumped I need a new shirt. Good shit 👍
I cannot feel my front delts when doing "Front Delt Exercise 2" are there any specific cues, I need to be aware of?
Oh shit you see those !? Ok nvm
I love full ROM, but now I realize I just like it. I'm still not going far enough. Same goes with slow eccentric motion - MORE MORE MORE!
Did you know Friday is shoulder day?  Going to try some of these movements. I was hoping Big Mike made an appearance...walking in the deep background like a yeti.
That Panatta machine is sent from heaven
How many reps did he do for Read Delt fly on cable ?
Peak cues
Front raises with dumbbells better even though still not the best exercise for front delt
Mike on or off drugs still a fat boy
They don't know what there talking about NO shoulder pressing at all it does nothing for shoulders there's no contraction and impinges shoulder in downward position thats y most have shoulder problems side lateral all the way up ridiculous rear cable lateral going to far back triceps to evolved
my traps end up getting sore during lateral raises...is that normal?
super-ROM lateral raise, pinky up as much as possible, slow
anyone know what gym this is?
This is one of the best shoulder workouts I have ever done. Hours later and I am still feeling it.
Hey Jeff! These crossover videos with Dr. Mike are awesome 👌
Is it okay to workout in the morning on an empty stomach, then eat breakfast afterwards?
Casual Antione Vaillant cameo.
After watching Dr Mike his voice haunts you in every rep - "slow slow slow slow slow".
Dr. Mike "gym can be comedy" Israetel :D
genetics plays the biggest part on shoulder development if you dont have capped delts you cant do anything to really make your shoulders pop
i want to give you a huge thanks for the beginning of the outro
I learned sooo much in this video
Antoine Vaillant?
This is pure gold!
Eduardo Kawak did side cable raises very similar to this.
7:47 "waAAayyyy hardderrr"
What a beautiful gym.
My shoulders have exploded after doing lateral raises as high/ back as I can.
10:39 Oh, hey Antoine
Watching videos like this make me wanna hit the gym soooo bad!
The amount of money I’d pay to workout and learn from Jeff and Mike is crazy
Jeff + Dr mike = good training, good information, good vibes = the best mindset
Super rom messed up my shoulders
The super ROM side delt raises are pretty close to a Liu /Lu Raise created/popularized by Lu Xiaojun iirc and I've been doing em for a while, love it! I use dumbbells a lot for it too. It'll fry for shoulders quick but also involves other muscles. Just can't push too much weight, even less than a typical lateral raise imo.
Awesome information 😅
I like the cleaner version of Mike 👍
Flexing during is the key
Slightly bend the elbows on the bar front raise and you die
Why does he look and sound like Dana white to me 😭
Absolute specimens walking around in that gym o.O
I love this, thank you both. Really good info and a good vibe between you :-)
My two favorite fitness advisors in a single video!
These are the worst exercises for shoulders
Should I hit shoulders two or three times a week? I'm 40 years old 😢
As a sartorial statement, Doktor Mike' mini-dress is rather fetching.
You don’t have to quote a study to tell people that chest movements also train anterior deltoids
Are this exercises safe to do for people who have problems in their rotator cuff muscles (especially sovraspinatus) ?
With regards to possible junk volume: could you train the delt heads as separate muscle groups (each e.g. the 6 sets per session optimum from the junk volume video) as they perform different movements? Or rather in an overall 6 set range due to the side delt component in many exercises especially for the rear delts?
Why do gyms play music in the first place when everyone who wants to hear music, brings their own headphones!?
A video about top 5 back exercises would be appreciated Jeff
Wow this is a great video.
When dr Mike said “ there are many #1’s” I KNEW he was gunna say “ and you’re my #1” 😂😂😂
Dude! That stuttering comedian got JACKED! ;)
Wow can we take a minute to appreciate Jeff's shoulder mobility.
Could watch these all day. Dr. Mike is a legend. Great stuff from Jeff too 👏
9:30 i need to know what that analogy is !!! what a video tho
These guys together is the best.
This workout made me cry thank you for that
Thanks Jeff for putting Dr Mike on the YouTube map!!
Like lite DB seated the first maybe 2nd notch back. Stretch at the bottom, stop b4 fully vertical and lose tension.
I've also added pauses in my r3ps due to dr Mike and I love it. I use every oportunity to use as little weight as possible for the most possible effect.
I tried those reverse cable flies. Killer on those rear delts. Thanks for the tips.
this gym has so many jacked women
I would argue that modt shoulderpain is either do to over training or because people do things the haven't done in a long time ( tennis after 5 years of pausing, reparing your sknk for 2 hours etc.) So the aren't adapted. If a joint can do a movement it should be fine to do said moment if you train
I love the videos of you too. Especialy because you are both of almost the same hight you can see what gear does to your physic if you have the right knowlege. And who far someone can come naturally
this is such a great video
Most definitely
If you’re not subscribed to both Jeff Nippard and Mike Israetal ….   Then you don’t even lift
I didn't understand the philosophy. You sayed that lateral is more important for the 3d look and you started with the front delts??🤔
I swear in another video on this channel you said time under tension and doing slow reps doesn't matter. Idk after lifting for only a year now, I went from beginner being just try and lift heavier whenever possible or do an extra rep, to looking at all the research and trying to do controlled reps but the deeper I get the more it just becomes, here's all this conflicting research, only thing for sure is progressive overload so now with some more experience im kind of back at good form (no swinging but tempo doesn't really matter, more to avoid injury) and progressive overload through increasing reps till a final set point and then adding weight
How can I NOT learn if Jeff still on here learning from other lifters…. Let’s keep it going Jeff… rocking with you bro. Love the scientific aspect too.
0:11 looks like a pair of shaved hobbits after a tren cycle.
two of my three favorite fitness youtubers! all that's missing is jeff cavalier, but him and dr mike would just argue about shoulder impingement the whole time anyway
Whats up With his belly?
Thanks this was rhe best video I, ve seen so far for shoulder exercises. Thanks again 💪🏼
Jeff, do a video on targeting the Lateral Triceps head/ or the arms
Good stuff, though the doctor was kind of creepy
so dr mike just stole the Lu raises and replaced the plates with dumbells:)))
simply intelligence!
Bruh .. my shoulders are so sore after doing the side lateral raises and front dealt bar bell ones with full range of motion . Thanks for the great ideas
Do this if you want to be the gym nerd who never grow
Oh my goodness did he just say “you’re my number one “ creepy 😂
Having healthy shoulders looks fun. I think 1 set of anything in this video would probably leave me injured and out of the gym for 3 months.
"don't neglect your rear delts, you want your shoulders fully capped" - Sam sulek
wow I've known about Dr. Mike for years but just found Jeff a few months ago and didn't realize he was at 4M subs.. nice work and well deserved!
I love bothe your guys channels. God bless and take care
Dr. Mike is a self deprecating scientist. There is no one better to learn from on youtube. Enjoy your lesson with Godzilla himself.
something i like to do on the cross cables for the side delt is use my arm that im not working out to stabilize my body to make sure my hips or torso aren't taking anything away from my shoulders
That machine at 1:36 is incredible!
Cross lateral Y raise. Is it better to perform the sweep in front or behind your body or does it make a difference?
Can believe u guys use 5kg for that super rom lateral raise
great video. as i suffer from fat disgusting hips and big bum I need to build my shoulders big time in 2024.. thanks and a merry christmas
Whats nuts is I literally do these ques already on these moves.
Antoine making a cameo 🤣
This was so much fun to watch you guys are a great moc of knowledge . Super fun to watch
Dude a gag reel of everything dr mike says is a must
Them overhead presses on a continual basis is impingement syndrome city.
Wow... I love your attitude.. towards people.... I am  Mexican living in Ensenada baja California.. and I will follow you.... From now on.. your my fitness mentor. Hugs from your new friend from Ensenada
every time i work out no matter what i do i don't feel any muscles whether its bench press or lat pull down i never feel any of my muscles working and i never feel sore at the end of the set i just cant move the wait. Ive been working out for about a year and for the past few months i have been stuck like this, has this happened to anyone else?
Showing the shoulders guys on the juice is misleading. You’ll never have those kind of shoulders naturally…never.
Thumbs up & bookmarked.  The rear delt exercise 2 I already am doing that way because that last bit feels soooooo goooooood, but for the rest I have a lot to learn, I see.
I love doing front delt isolation exercises on desert islands
Really fantastic demonstration. You two need to do more of these together. You guys make a great team! Excellent video!!!!
A collab with Dr. Mike would be great. I appreciate the dissection of the side delt exercises very much, so helpful.
Hey bro, would love to know pros/cons on eating carb heavy vs fat heavy. Is eating more carbs than fats better for muscle growth? Does it matter? I'm currently averaging 160g fat and 260g carbs and wondering if lowering fats to 100g and upping carbs to 320g would help build muscle more efficiently? Much love
1:17 Machine shoulder press
5:00 I’ve been doing super ROM for a few weeks now and love the exercise but also had this question because my arms naturally go thumbs up as well and I wasn’t sure which was better but i figured thumbs up was more front delts but palms down sometimes feels like my traps take over. Thanks for clearing that up for me lol
Lmfao at Antoine at the end 😂😂
TLDR: Spam lateral raisers
More obvious steroid use
Great stuff. But aren't those db lateral raises problematic above parallel?
lol top 3 exercices are testosterone, HGH and insulin...🤣
This is the best shoulders video I've ever seen. The side raises and rear delt cables are so good. Fully burnt on the lowest weights.
my front delt dont grow upper chest take everything
cool, but I wish there were fewer cable and machine exercises.
No dildo raises? disappointed
Hey Jeff I was just curious. Have you read any Ayn Rand? Atlas shrugged maybe?
I want to see Jeff Nippard train Drew Lynch 😂
So Dr Mike aka Dr Super Rom
Where did you get that shoulder press machine at I've never seen one and would love to add that
Damn the chicks walking around in that gym are bigger than most guys in my gym...
Interesting and all but seriously in 2024 I hope to see "a study" that show if yes or not, natty people should train like juiced people. Period
I wish my gym had a huge sign that says "AS IF ANOTHER"... maybe people would stop slamming/dropping the weights..... probably not
Free weight wise. Standing dumbbell shoulder press and seated lateral raises and rear delt flys
Behind the neck shoulder press on the smith machine is our personal favourite
He lowkey looks like Kurt Angle..
I usually learn a lot from you, Jeff, but I learned SO MUCH from the both of you in this video.
He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him. John 3:36  For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.  Romans‬ ‭6‬:‭23 Jesus Christ is the only way, seek Him while He may be found, before it’s too late, tomorrow is never promised.
Awesome video Jeff. Thanks for the advice.
Loved it, casual but very informative,  nice details.
Question- when you are doing the machine shoulder presses your back is super arched, kind of turning it into a very inclined press and cheating with your chest, is that ideal or intentional?
Is that Antoine Vaillant at 10:42?
Jeff is the landmine lateral raise similar enough to your cable y raise or what is the alternative for us home gym folks
that side delt exercise Dr. Mike is suggesting is so called Lu press. Lu as in Lu Xiaojun, chinese olympic champion weightlifter. Absolute legend. Chinese weightlifters do it as standard for side delts. But they use 15 kg plates :D. There are videos on YT. Check.
Jeff, come on. How can a PED guy suggest training? Or you ped yourself too?
Too many IQ points in one video.
Liking the reaching out cue 👌🏿
Great video. Thank you for the detailed explanation. 💪🏻
Yes sir these exercises are awesome thanks Dr Mike I'm using bands not ideal still I'm working
Good stuff
ill like u two to make a best way to rrain every muscle group efficiently back by science
That sound, 6:36 , was it Jeff's muscles fibers getting torn?
Next collab with Dr. Mike needs to be a candlelit dinner 👉👈 👀
Please yes, more content with him.
The shorty avengers have assembled
I’m a get the sleeves up,  Ant walks by.   I change my mind. 😂😂😂
Dr. John Kirsch also recommends super-rom lateral raises for shoulder health
Jeff if you wanna build God’s momentum, let’s build fast twitch muscles
The Dr Mike being Dr Mike part killed me 😂
Two very knowledgeable and genuine great trainers to watch, was funny seeing Dr Mike's innuendos and Jeffs quite serious personalities mix lol, great content.
Okay, I feel a little better now. I swear I was just starting to implement a bar raise, inverted grip for front delts. And I kinda felt like a fool at first. But this has now cemented this movement into my regular shoulder workouts. Thanks guys! Gonna try the shoulder "sword draw. "
Keep on dreaming noobs. 3D delts are achieved with anabolic steroids only.
Thanks man. My shoulder workouts have gotten so stale lately. These were great new exercises to try.
Doesn't the scapula work in the ez bar raise above 90° ?
Don’t do that thing at the end in your socks and Y front unless you’re posing on Grinder…
Okay these are great, I love kerning new techniques in the gym! Thanks for sharing
Like 👏👏👏👏👏👏
So basically just another version of shoulder press, Egyptian cable lateral raise, machine reverse fly, and facepull.
Lifters in olympic weightlifting circles call those super-rom lat raises "Lu Raises" popularized by Lu Xiaojun
I tried that super rom raise in my basement gym and hit the ceiling, waking my children. Thanks a lot, Dr. Mike.
Love mike. Great guy. But let’s remember genetics
God.... Everything, chest, arms. Pretty pls
we need an entire series like this WIth RP
Are they natty though?
I have weird right shoulder popping in my right shoulder with a lot of lifts. What should i be doing to fix this?
Hallo i am 16 and started working out but I don't know how much protine should I take please can someone help me
As always- top tier content.
Lateral raises all the way up = shoulder impingement
2:53 cameraman knew the job very well. Anyways great video Jeff. Appreciate your efforts
10:37 Antoine Vaillant makes an appearance.
No standing barbell overhead press? Are you serious?
Love the content my guy. As someone who has been training 10 plus years, I still find myself learning new tips and techniques almost weekly. Currently 6’0 195 tryna get up and shredded like DK metcalf maybe 215-220💪😤
I don't see any stretch emphasis regarding exercise selection, with all the literature we have regarding its benefit (at least +10% more gains) i would opt for low cable front raise, low cable side raise (or egyptian lateral raise but without the leaning) and high cable rear delt fly
I respect you're a natural bodybuilder. I know how hard it is to gain muscles and be in shape doing it all naturally without roids.
10:31 the slowww turn and the cut straight after… golden!!
very cool video. I learnt many things
Jeef bro i need a cutting program from yourside
Why do you sound like a Smurf
I thought that was Kurt Angle!!! 😂😂😂
The world is so lucky to have Dr. Mike give out nuggets for free. Goddamit daddy ♥️
my 2 favorite channels having a crossover! what is this? the Marvel universe?! 🎉 awesome vid!
Mike's the best, he's that old school lifter in a mumu at the gym
Great video as usual Jeff.
You know you're short when Mike Israetel towers over you 😂
Is an Atkins shake worthy of being called a Protien shake? Asking for a friend.
So Lu raises are still the goat for side delts gotcha
Doing lateral raise like that will fucked up your elbow.
Slow on decline and partial reps also help greatly
@2:24 women do it too
this dwarf is funny
Such a fun time! Hope to see you again soon! -c
Some pawgs in there fair play..
that place looks more like a strip club than a gym
Trying this tomorrow
I dig that this dude is fuckin shredded but he sounds like he’s about to explain FNAF lore to you for two and a half hours. The type of nerd who got shoved in a locker so much he became too wide to fit in them and now he puts other people in lockers
Gonna try Jeff's side delt cable excersise for sure 👍👍 my shoulders are dead just thinking about it
It's interesting showing part of the shoulder anatomy at 1:12 then you go into a machine shoulder press at 1:17  So there is no obvious sign of pushing the shoulder tendon up into the acronium causing "shoulder impingement".  Lol if they only knew the irony only physical therapists seem to know not to go overhead like that it's amazing how these two have no clue what the shoulder does.
I love Antoine just casually being in the background
Loved the clips at the end😂
I see my crush in blue
Great video, chest next?
The super-rom lateral raises gave me a bad shoulder impingement. You should never suggest it. I'm so disappointed 😞
*-seated machine overhead press* (seated dumbbell or seated smith machine if the machine at your gym sucks) *-dumbbell lateral raise* (or cable y raise) *-cable lateral raise* (cable at hip height, lengthened position) *-any rear delt fly* (reverse pec deck is the best option try using neutral grip too, no 45° of abduction isnt more rear delt, the rear delts insert on the humerus so the muscle fibers change angle based on humeral elevation, the rear delt's fibers are at a 45° angle when the arms are pointed straight down but fiber orientation doesn't really matter here, 45° of abduction will involve slightly more lats whereas 90° will be almost entirely rear delts if you keep the scapula stationary, if you let the scapula move then it'll hit the entire upper back with the rear delts aka the traps and rhomboids)
“There are many #1s.  “You’re my #1”
Greatest duo to come to fitness; perfect balance of opinion and they have great chemistry making them entertaining too
HEY JEFF & DR. MIKE, can y'all do a lower traps and lats video? I appreciate both of you! 💪💪
Jeff’s side delt exercise is also a d2 pnf pattern. Great for rehab and throwing athletes
lmao Antoine Vaillant
4:42 great way to tear your cufs
I know it’s recently come into trend, but would you do a video on Shilajit and whether or not studies support its use?
Biggest front and side Delt pump just going over head rather then horizontal
Jeff please do a video talking about sprengles deformity, it's a muscular disease in the shoulder that I suffer with but I've never met another human being with it and I can't find any training videos about it, doctor said when i was younger to not train shoulders so now they're incredibly weak, I can literally bicep curl more than I can shoulder press 😂 I've realised though I can train it and never actually have problems with it so looking to put some stressed on them now
I feel this Dr Mike dude should do a collab with Will Tenny feel their humour would work well together
Hell for me is having to scroll down YouTube and see just every video have   (with science) (SCIENCE BASED)  (What science says) Etc.
I've learned there is no real wrong way to train debts. Verity is the key. Heavy in your presses and high rep to failure  on laterals. Drop sets are the bomb.
Isn’t superROMing lateral raises making it much more prone to injury?
do one for the back :)
Dude I've never tried these "lateral sword raise/pull" before but now that I did - this is the best i have ever felt my delts. EVER. Thank you for this
I’m a big “mind over matter” kind of guy and those cues were amazing! Such good insight! Thank you for posting! 🤩❤️👍
Love Dr Mike, more please!
I just recovered from an injury to my left shoulder and this is an absolute godsend
1:30 Gotta raise that rear shirt to get the most out of Smith Machine Squats.
I purchesed your guide and have been seeing great results! I was looking into specifically training my delts more so this video came out at the perfect time!  Keep up the good work, Jeff!
best fitness youtubers ever, just really great advice always
No one gonna talk about that Bradley Martin’s on the tv in the black gym?
And chemistry 😂
I added the DB and easy bar exercises to m shoulder program today thanks
he forgot the number 1 answer to that question, - juice and gear  🤡
Looks like the best gym
Thanks a lot Jeff for that amazing video, the collab with Dr Mike was out of common and very juicy for the ones who takes training serious, keep making videos like that!!
these are one of the safest and joint friendly exercises i have seen
This may be a dumb question but If your doing 4 sets of 12. When should you move up the weight? After completing all 12 reps on the first set, or after completing 12 on all 4?
w
Omg it's happened!!!! They finally got together!!! This is amazing!!!
Dr. Mike is by far the most exciting guest to see. I would love a video like this for the entire back.
3:35 Cameraman changed his mind to stay on track...
Was that Anton?
Bro train calisthenics its simpler than all this mumbo jumbo isolation
Best combo ever with these two guys! Knowledge and entertainment overload 🤯💪
Training advice from Jocko Willink is always welcome!
I was just thinking about how to grow my shoulders. This video is just what I needed. Also, I love this collab ❤
Love the quality man, keep literally pressing forward.
I did the full laterals and I got to say my shoulder hurts bad. I'm not sure what I did wrong but that exercise eliminated my shoulder.
Super ROM lateral just like serge NUBRET side lateral
Ive been bb for 20 years. I really don't learn much nowadays. But I give Dr Mike the upmost respect. He's 100% worth listening to and he gives some top notch tutorials for free. And he's honest when it comes to gear about how much easier it is on PEDs and natural
nippard is a steroid wimp
A+   great vid Jeff
good video
You’ve always had good delts. And you’ve been lifting for years.
loved this! please more with him
I accidently went from trying isolate front delts to learning GREAT mind muscle connection to my upper pecs. Best thing that ever happened to my chest!
Your delts are 3D? 🤦‍♂️
Oh man what a fantastic video!
I think the people in the Fitness Industrie don't know anymore what natural means🙄
Mike was disingenuous when he told Jeff he was his #1. We all know Mike's #1 will always be Henry Cavill
why dr mike wearing 2 different socks lmao
Firet step, be 5'4, you're welcomed.
Lobv that you included the BTS.  Very fun.
Antoine Vaillant casually strolls by in the back at the end haha. Great video guys! Thanks!
Definitely going to try this-clearly won’t need much weight to really be effective
4:40 FINALLY, DR MIKE, JEFF NIPARD AND THE MOST EPIC LIFT: LU RAISES
I love the girl from the start of the video, she trained next to Jeff. Please thump up this comment so she might see it and we can get into contact. PLEASE for the future of our kids.
At 7:33 you can see a fine example of the impeccable facial expression out of sheer stress and pain when Dr.Mike stands BEHIND you. IYKYK ;)  Also,this was another absolute gem of a video. Got some great tips for my next shoulder session. Thank you Jeff & Dr.Mike 🙏🏻
U should tren hard
Another tip for controlling the negative rather than tell yourself you're going to do another rep is just count the reps on the negative as opposed to the concentric, it really does help slow down those negatives
🤓☝️ ACTUALLY..
You can just feel how hard it is for Dr. Mike to act professional for Jeff's video😂
bro jeff whats your opinion on finasteride ?
Science and steroids
To much muscles get in the way of sex
im trying to get imax delts
Dr Mike looks like a fool holding weights and creating tension from the cable balls
“Naturally”
After years and years of pressing movements to try and build my delts (and getting minor success) I dropped them completely. Heavy partial lat raises have grown my delts more in three years than pressing did in 20.
Exercise 1: lateral trembo raises Exercise 2: Dianabol stand press Exercise 3: dumbell primo machine
I’ve been watching her off and on for years but one thing I can say about this guy..   He’s got a beautiful head of hair.. lol
Epic advice
prediction: arnold press, lateral raise, rear delt flies
for my workout, should I do all the exercises on the video or e for each part of the delt?
A yes to every part of this video
Really cool colab!! Great to see these developments.
Amazing
I’m more focused on the babes in the background
I love how this is consistent with Jeremy Ethier's research on his channel, the two of ya are probably the best science based bodybuilding youtubers on the scene rn.
those rear delt cues on the reverse pec deck are game changing for me. Literally had to drop 30kg on the stack... I had turned it into a compound movement...
Useful vid, and good tips!  I'd be interested to see what a top 3 would look like for a homegym or a budget setup instead of the machines available at a gym.
Fun drinking game - do a shot every time they say “cue” 😂
Almost all of these exercises incorporate the low/mid/upper traps way too much.
Can I "thumbs down" my side delt exercises?
The money que from the jewish guy is spot on.
I’m constantly saying “slow, slow, as if another” after discovering Dr Mike
Will you do a video on how sleep effects muscle growth
Reverse pec dec seems like you are using a breast stroke motion when swimming. Push out and then sweep back in broad motion. Very nice! ouch!!
8:09. Haha!   I been trying to figure out, for months, the position I should be holding on this.  🙏
This was a legit video, I will implement some of these techniques. For the ez bar front raise , could you position an adjustable bench around 30-40* and attempt the raise while lying chest and stomach on the incline?
3:34 we saw that mr. cameraman.
Was that antione vaillant?
I love how humble you are just there to learn as well even though you know so much, love it thanks for this
3:50 what is bro doing
Really loved all the exercises that you guys recommended. They’re all awesome and very helpful. I really love the super ROM lateral raises as they feel quite amazing for me and also look very aesthetically pleasing. I also love Dr. Mike’s cue to do the last repetition eccentric as if you’re going to do another. It really helps with milking that last repetition as much as possible.
I want to see more Jeff/Mike colabs!
Absolutely loved the collaboration between you and Dr. Mike! You guys are two of my favorite people in the fitness community. I’ve leaned plenty from you and truly admire your work and highly appreciate the amount of effort and dedication that you guys put in the content. Thank you so much for sharing all the super helpful videos with us. I’m deeply grateful to you for that. I’ve enjoyed all your collaborations and I’m certainly looking forward to more of them. 🙏
well done to dr mike for getting through a whole video without saying anything outrageously homoerotic
Dr.Mike’s a gentle soul . A funny big scary gentle soul.
The sheer disappointment in Dr. Mike’s face at 9:30 was somewhat wholesome for some reason, when he was talking about how some people doesn’t make the best use of the last negative rep.
The Super ROM Lat Raises remind me a LOT of the Lu Raises except the Lu Raise is how Jeff naturally was doing them at first with the thumbs going up as the arms go above the shoulders.   Tried the super rom and its a HELL of a burn and i normally do 13.5kg dumbell lat raises for 6-8 reps and i had to drop down to 3.5kg to get in that 10-20 range. Ill prolly stick to Lu Raises as my go-to variation tho
https://youtu.be/21lYP86dHW4?t=642 What is Antoine Vaillant doing there? :D
Dr mike is above me, simply a legend
Biggest missing cue what Dr. Mike always says is to start doing side deltoids first before doing front deltoids because the pre-exhaustion makes the front deltoids be more susceptible to growth since front deltoids can take a shitload until you feel something. And I tend to agree doing side deltoids (over the head for mega stretch) and afterwards front deltoids with pressing (log press usually, and doing viking press occasionally for strength)
I just started doing the cross body Y raise on accident actually. Was doing single arm x Tricep pushdowns and was messing around with the cables a bit and found I really enjoyed them
Bro i did the rear delt fly Machine with "punching " my arms forward and going slow. My rear delts are sooo sore this morning.
Not big on commenting on YouTube, but this vid's definitely my top pick. Just put together a new shoulder workout plan from these exercises. Dr. Mike's awesome, and him teaming up with Jeff is just epic. Can't wait for more stuff like this, Jeff!
Wholesome channel 😂😂
OMG those cues! I was already doing all these "best exercises" but i think ill finally be able to do them all the correct way for the first time
My favourite video 👍 I actually do calisthenics mostly but watch u both for the principles
Love Mike.
I came to YouTube with the intention of searching some based delt training and this just popped in my feed. Synchronicities never stops!
More techniques to get the muscle to feel more tension with less weight is great. Less chance of injury when you lose technique, make a mistake or are just under recovered.
Very interesting que there for the rear delt pec-dec. Hunter Labrada did a video on how he does it and it's different. His advice was to keep the shoulder blades protracted; stabilizing it and allowing only the rear delt to move subsequently loading it as well.
Love seeing both of your share tips and engage with each other during a workout. More please 😮😅
This came at perfect time.  Just finished healing a shoulder injury and looking to catch my delts up so they match the rest of my body.
He did shoulder exercises. You’re welcome.
My two favorites together!
I used these top three exercises and a shit ton of steroids to build 3d delts
This was great. However with me, as soon as I quit doing front raises and focused more of my rear delts, I started to get that V taper from the backside signifigantly.  I think chest day really handles the front delts well.  So implementing more side delts and rear delts on shoulder day is a must
Aaah the king of manlets, our king!
You should see Athlean-x 's video about the rear delts as well, it's a bit more comprehensive to me.
Love your videos Jeff! I am enhanced but I respect your intelligence and training ur doing great!
Jeff and Dr Mike coming together in a video is basically the fitness universe equivalent of the Avengers in the MCU
dr mike israetel my boy
The ez-bar front delt exercise - two quick questions: 1) You are using a underhand grip - isn't that more upper chest vs an overhand that would traget delts more? 2) Once you raise the bar past horizontal, don't the traps take over making it more of a trap focused exercise? Many thanks for the great videos!
Whats the difference between pronated vs suppinated hand positions for front delt raises?
"Thumbs up or thumbs down?" "Whatever you like, whatever feels natural." "I like thumbs up, it feels natural." "No, not that one, you're dumb."
CONGRATS on hitting 4m - amazing! Excellent amount of info; 70-80% on side delts  - yep makes sense 🙂
HE SAID JEFF WAS HIS NUMBER 1
Fantastic video, liked the part about explaining how the different exercises can feel different (like those front raises), also was that Antoine Vaillant at the end 😅
Yes my name is Dr. Mike
Two best in the business! Learned so much from you two
I implemented the front delts exercise # 2 to my shoulder workout and I’ve never wanted to throw the EZ bar across the room soooo bad! 😂 great tips and exercises guy!
learned so many things. thanks champ
Broooo they are so hard to grow🥲
Fantastic video. Please do more collaborations with other exercise science experts.
stop the bodybuilding and get back into powerlifting before it's too late, Jeff!
Happy to be watching , pretty much all your videos again !!
I was thinking about trying something new for side delts. Take a weight that is heavier than you can side lateral but okay to overhead press. Don't go too crazy and injure yourself though. Then do a slow negative from the top to take advantage of that extra eccentric strength to overload the side delts.
Can we have a bro Jeff and bro Dr Mike colab plz.
brooooooo thank you
as a 5’5 man myself. i really appreciate seeing both my biggest enhanced and natty idol in fitness together.
Hi, So I  always heard and always made sure to keep my elbows at a slight angle because it could injure the joints. I see you're fully extended, always. Is there any actual risk on either? Thank you.
Renaissance Periodization is a legendary channel 😱
Oh! A wild Antoine Vaillant appeared!
Love this DUO 🤣💖🔥
Drawing and flicking a sword. Such a relatable experience, not at all like starting a gas powered lawn mower or pressure washer.
Can’t wait to try these!
Dr. Mike is a brainiac gigachad lol absolute W
w jeff & mike thanks bros
These 2 are the best we need more collabs.
Simple pressing movement lateral movement for side and rear done
dds
Always entertaining to watch Jeff gawkgawk one of his expert guests and everyone of their comments
Does a pronated vs supinated grip impact effectiveness of front raises?
Great cool duo 👍🏻
The only 2 blokes I trust on YouTube for gym and fitness related advise and information.
I just finished doing jeffs “ Y “ Side Delt exercises . Its amazing
5:43 are u a nazi?
You two together... its a master class.  Thanks!
Amazing video.
That guys funny! Lol
Again my top science based fitness masters in world now ♥️
I think bro found his gym soulmate
Bro just do some push ups
Absolutely loved the lateral raises all the way up! First time trying it and damn! Never going back! Great duo!
It kinda goes without saying at this point but this sort of content is the best stuff on fitnesstube, no bs no disinfo or misinfo, no selling a product or hyping a brand. Just pure helpful information & positive guidance. It's much appreciated.
Wait a gym that actually has maces? Whole heartedly recommend doing some mace 360's, feels great.
Waiting for Coach Greg to react
between the two of yall.. I got the best workout routine haha
Great! Will implement some of the super ROM lateral delt raises, I was looking for something new... Thank you for the video! :)
Dr mike gotta be the best gym bro out there
Shit, ive been doing that Dr Mike rear delt fly cue by complete accident!
After injury a number of years ago I moved to purely using gym rings for upper body workouts. Can't recommend them enough for shoulder training and can't beat the price
5:43 sus
Best shoulder workout I’ve done in Years!!!
Omg, stop being a noob
That gym looks SO good.
Great piece, Jeff! I never saw Dr. Mike working out before today.
Sorry but how do I get a buldging gut like Mike? Whar exercises do I do for that? Looking for the large intestine look.
My 2 faves together
Pure muscle and fitness becoming the mecca of bb in canada :) Shout out to antoine valliant in the back ahah
Lmao all of sudden when Mike is popin off ur doin video w him leeching off lol
I tried Super ROM Lateral Raise yesterday and I felt more tension on the traps once my arms went higher than 90 degress. One of the reasons why I had to stop doing Lu Raises, too!
Great cooperation, stay 💪
Do you need to hit shoulders this specifically to see growth? I only do a seated dumbbell press, which I do 3 times a week.
I have been training for a couple of years with jeff's program. Jeff got me started on how to train and execute lifts with proper technique and now Dr. Mike is pulling in and humbling my lifts. Everything I have been doing in all my lifts have decreased in weight but technique and pure pump in the muscles have been outstanding. I live nearby and wish i could train with either of you guys.I am no where near my ideal physique but with both of these guys coming together to bring their expertise in bodybuilding and science based lifting will definitely be a sight to see. Maybe a possible workout program collaberation?!? It would be literally insane!
Goat collab
How come you guys aren't doing lengthened partials with these exercises?
Love a random Antoine Valiant appearance lol
Lengthened partials! You don't need to do the most contracted part of the ROM because it doesn't produce as much hypertrophy as doing the most lengthened part. Besides, doing needlessly long eccentrics and excessive ROM just produces more fatigue and potential for injury, not more hypertrophy.
You're amazing! Thank you for everything you do! ❤
Two of my favorite science based creators under one gym roof? Christmas came early!
Those super-rom lateral raises has the dude from AthleanX sitting in the corner rocking back and forth screaming "IMPINGEMENT IMPINGEMENT IMPINGEMENT"
Top video gents
Great video. Dr Mike is brilliant but I don’t often watch him because of the language and I have a lot of kids around. I learned a lot.
Dr. Mikes innuendos are so good lol 😂
priceless advice. time to build those boulder shoulders
Seriously, the two channels I swear by and always listen to in the same video giving absolutely golden advice is priceless. I will seriously come back to this video again and again and again, I already know it.
Neff Jippard awsome as always
Everybody tryna reinvent the wheel. These are all basic standard isolation exercises but they all put their own spin on them to make them unique. Thats just the sad reality of influencers these days, they gotta post something unique because basic stuff doesnt get promoted.
Dude Jeff and Dr Mike in one video? This is insanity. Truly blessed to get this information for free and in an accessible format.
Cameraman coming in with that strategic zoom @2:56
Dr. Mike changed many things in my workouts, I can see and feel the difference! Love this collab !
'Dr. Mike being Dr. Mike' should be included at the end of any video he does with someone 😂
Jeff, you've been lifting for years, longer than I do. I'm 100% sure that you're already aware of all the cues Dr Mike mentioned in this video. You'll still look the same compared to other gym goers who just lift normally without these specific cues. These cues won't make a big difference, why waste effort on doing boring stuff? Going to the gym should be fun & exciting, it's not a chore.
WHAT ARE THOSE LEGSSSSS
Your Calves while you’re doing the seated db press … My Guy!! Lol that’s insane 👏
Pull day today, nice timing!
Thank you for this. It's really interesting and I'm actually in the process of doing this in my gym as I'm typing this! Feeling it...
The best science based lifting duo on YouTube 🙌🏼🙌🏼
Love the bloopers
2 nice midgets :)
Woooo the infamous thumbs parallel side lateral raise... say good bye to supraspinatus tendons dear viewers.
I tried these today minus the pec deck. Got a crazy delt pump. Gonna keep it in my routine
I like your content, but throwing "using science" in every effing video is such a turn down and cringy.
Your pinned comment made me want to ask you for another masterclass with the mountaindog. Love all your colabs but your content with john has to be my favourite.
For me, the front delts are the most important. I ignored the front delts once and my shoulders didn't have that rounded look. If a girl can't do push-ups or doesn't train chest muscles, she has to focus predominantly on the front delts.
Great vid guys!!!
Hi - great vid. I’m following the advice now. Re the side Delt weight you used, do you recommend a light weight for this? What weight did you use in the video? Thanks.
Awesome!!!🎉
Do you think these could be done with bands where you would normally use a cable machine?
So wholesome to see you two together! ❤️
Isn't it proved by researchers that too long negative phase is bad for hypertrophy?
Man, when/if you choose to enter enhanced bodybuilding, you will probably win an Olympia. That is an insane natural physique
You 5’4
I feel like those extra ROMs will hurt my shoulders later on👀
I was just looking at my arms and thinking I need wanted to improve this area.  Perfect timing!!
Loved this ,thanks guys,much appreciated
Could you do a video on Conditioning for each muscle group? I feel like since shoulders for example, are notorious for injuries like AC Joint pain, rotator cuff injuries etc. conditioning should be a huge part of our general training.
Wondering if there's a difference when using pec deck...  I don't use the grips, instead I place my hands on the bar and make a swimming motion.
Is dr mike Canadian as well?
Great tips. Ty
lmao is that antoine vaillant at the end? red hat?
"Beautiful form, Jeff" "No. You're beautiful, Mike" (Careless Whisper starts playing)
My front delts are so overdeveloped from just benching
Hey Jeff, your videos are always a game changer! I tried incorporating the rear delt cable flies into my routine after watching this one, and oh my, what a difference! The stretch on my rear delts is unreal, and I can really feel the burn. Thanks for sharing these gems – they've taken my workouts to a whole new level. Your content is top-notch, and I appreciate the valuable tips you provide. Looking forward to more killer workouts and advice. Keep it up! 💪🔥
Thank you for the info! I dropped my regular lateral raise for the cross body lateral raise, really liking it a lot more. considering implementing the ex bar front raise as well!
Such a great video!  Great nuggets of wisdom that I learned here and incorporated into my workout today.  I literally thought about “sweeping a pile of cash” while doing rear delts today on the reverse pec deck machine.  Thanks Jeff and Dr. Mike!
Yes!!! Masterclass w/ Dr. Mike
Jeff is a legend for showing the world what can be done WITHOUT DRUGS.  Just hard work, time and sciencing the shit out of resistance training.  This is what integrity looks like.
cant wait to try that rear delt fly que.
Should I be doing these before compound lifts like dips and bench press or after?
That gym is so nice.
Just so we are clear, this man is not natural. 0 chance.
Ah yes, "natural"
Hard work, smart planning, and being 5'3".
Seriously, can't believe I missed these 2 at Pure....that would have been a sick session to be in the vicinity of while I try to look like I'm not eavesdropping. Also, Antoine was there?! Star studded event!
Dr Mike has the best analogies and examples lol
That rear delt movement really hit
Meteoric rise well deserved.  Look out Athlean-x new 👑 coming for the crown
Slow slow slow
Was that Antoine Vaillant in the background haha?
This was one of the best videos of yours I've ever watched. After watching you for so long, and knowing both you and Mike rely very much on science, there was no need for references in this particular video. It was also a great mix of educational and entertaining. I didn't know Mike was so funny 😂
Dr. Mike is the  greatest GOAT of all time
Hahaha yeah us 3 in the gym we would get good work done but the inbetween comments would be ☠️☠️☠️😂
Great info! I've been doing these exercises while following your Pure Bodybuilding program, and I just picked up on some great cues from the video. Can't wait to try them at the gym!
Really good video, Jeff! Felt fun
Gave this a try at gym with the extra stretch and yea i had to lower the weight with a better burn, very interesting and a good duo to watch
Rear delts give you that round look.
You know what the worst part of being into fitness is?  Trying to find an American girlfriend, who is also into fitness, and a DECENT HUMAN BEING.  I can LITERALLY SEE THE IMMENSE EGO'S (and narcissistic qualities) of every woman in the background of this video.   Seems like we, in the USA, only have two choices:  1.) Date a lazy obese hog.  2.) Date a woman who will always love HERSELF 100x more than YOU.
Using chemistry 😂
I tried those super rom laterals with very light weight just for technique; I had places in my shoulders popping that I didn’t know could. It feels amazing. 😂
The heavily edited Dr Mike
Great tips!!!
Ok one set super rom lateral raise and arms smoked.. got a lot of work to do 😅
Mike Mentzer also said the rear pec delt machine is best for rear delts. 😎
Mahalo Jeff and Dr Mike.  Truly appreciate the 3D Shoulder Collab amongst many other great collars by you 2…informative, ahah moments activated, and stoked for my next workout!  Keep up da information dump to the masses!
lol jay cutler huge front and rear delts, not so big medials.
Seeing the difference between the way Mike acts with someone for Science and someone like Will Tennyson is crazy 😂 great guy, great knowledge, and great humor
You’re such a goofball Jeff 😊
7:17 is that vinnie hacker lol
Dr. Mike and Jeff are top tier!
1:40 I think actually that u might’ve gone over in another video but there is research showing that partial reps in the stretched position are more effective and less taxing than a full range of motion
Just tried it, worked like a dream. My delts never been so sore
Cool to see you guys collabing! Love the chemistry. I’m gonna try that reverse pec dec cue next time.
2 of my favorite voices in this space.. yes please!!
💯🤍 HANDSOME HOT🧑🏼🧑🏻‍🦲✨💪🏻🔥❤️
This is just beautiful.
Come for the gym advices, stay for the jokes.
4:37 The Real #1 😂
Excellent video. Really liked this one and the format.
Perfect💯 👍🙌
10:42 is that Antoine Vaillant?
hey jeff do you think you'll ever do a pure powerlifting program?
Antoine just casually strolling through the shot. Legendary gym status right there
Antone ?10:40
Close your eyes and tell me Mikes voice isn’t Vince Vaughn
Mike is underrated. Love the collab.
if thats how you buildt your baby shoulders then im not going to do it, who the fuck wants to listen to a guy on how to train shoulders when you have trained for almost 10 years and still is small as fuck. 2 excercises is enough, shoulderpesss and upright rows. and i got WAY bigger shoulder then u on half the time you have trained
Thank you for making this video because is hard training Delts and the quality is perfect 👍
Wow! This is just awesome! It’s like a “2 for 1 video”!!!
Dr Mike's rear delts are underdeveloped compared to the rest of his body. Maybe in theory back training takes care of it, but in reality we can all see how the majority of people have big front delts and very small rear delts. Theory will only take you so far 🤓
Camera man almost got distracted at 03:35
I was watching another vid about cabe rear delts and it said the fibers run at a 45 degree angle so pull arms down rather than back...whats your thoughts on this
anyone else notice how everyone in this gym is just in their best physique like damn!!
Quick tip:  Take a break after 2 exercise explanations  I didn't, now I have sore eyes...the pump is crazy😅
I've watched Jeff for years and I think this is some of the best content he's ever done. Simple, comparison-based, different perspectives, helping each other, I love it. Thanks Jeff!
2:07 I recently learned that if both sides are working at the same time but independently it’s called Iso-Lateral. Thought you might find this interesting.
Absolute S tier combination here! Would love to see a series with you two leveraging your knowledge 💪
You have 3D Delts because you're 3 feet tall
I've been doing a heavy standing Arnold Press from your push video Jeff, has this exercise slipped down on your list of recommendations? Since you seem to emphasise seated stability here.  Great video. Will be adding some of these in.
Mike says "slow" as much as Ronnie Coleman says "LIGHT WEIGHT, BABY!"
9:38 Mike can't resist
15 years of lifting just to get what 2 years of steroids will get you
100% hitting delts next workout! Great video! Love it
Two of my all time favourites. And “as if another” again. That needs to be on a RP t shirt.
Naturally, sure. Thats why you have roided traps and veins and visible abs at high bodyfat levels, right? SARM is the new natural.... ;)
Above all i really appreciate the humour between these two
Wow, that protracted move on the rear delt machine is really cool and one I’ve never considered in the 35+ years of being in this game!
D.o.p.e.
I might per monthly cos Mike is the absolute man with unbelievable knowledge, thankyou 💪🏼
Soon to be DOCTOR David, Commenting on 4:30 . The most effective part of the rep is probably the bottom half from the max stretch behind the body until the bar is at a 90 degree angle in front of the body.😮
Dana white working out with Jeff in his spare time
Just two wittle guys doing big things
So even Dr. Mike says it..SPAM LATERAL RAISES!
Who else really wants a Jeff Nippard action figure? ✋
🤘🏼🔥 let’s goooo
I mean this in the best possible way, I loved seeing Jeff get destroyed doing a RP workout. An after action video on you thoughts of those training sessions would be great.
antoine giving me body dysmorphia just existin
Wow! Dr. Mike and Jeff really love money. Will we see a Lamborghini show off in the future?
7:32 me when high school year book photos
awesome video!
that xavy rusan is always the vibe
Drugs?
i was just watching a mike israetel video and then this popped up. Im not complaining
Drawing and flicking a sword is my new favourite Cue ever
5 likes yet 1000 comments?? Cmon guys give the mans a like
I really do want it from the rear😂
I'm curious why do you go for a supinated grip on the ez-bar for front raises other than the pronated grip.
My 2 favorite fitness gurus in one video!!
Both of these dorky dwarfs will never be aesthetic
Tbf steroids is science too lmao
How can you claim to promote hypertrophy training when only 2 years ago you made a video where you said that touching the chest on bench press isn't neccessary?
Great video Jeff, can't wait to try those.  Quick question.  I notice my traps take over a lot when doing side lateral raises.  Any advice to focus just on the side delts and deactivate the traps?
dude NATURALLY looks better and more full than pros who iject stuff in their shoulders, damn he must have know some SECRET SCIENCE thats not avaliable to other mortals
Tq so much idol   U r my source of information
Still waiting for the "did we just become best friends" from Joffrey Nipples
1:19 Best exercise. :)
"id get it, but I don't want to be crippled for life" That was awesome. Full range of motion is so vital.
Thor  10:09
Using "science". Got it ;)
Since I heard Dr. Mike in my last rep I always hear in my head -As if another, mf XDD
Dr. Mike Israetel 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️ROIDS!!!!
see the thing is, Jeff doesn't have 3d delts. In fact, most people who train push pull legs all have a great chest, big back and huge legs, but undeveloped shoulders and arms.   Say what you want about a bro split but you will find most who train in that style have a well balanced physique
There is poetry in every line Mike says...🥰
You just know the editors worked magic to keep this PG
how'd you know my delts are lagging jeff!
I've learned so mach from dr. Mike. Great to see you two collabbing.
So many great tips, thanks! Do videos with Dr Mike on other muscles, you guys are a great duo 👏🏻 Congrats on 4 million subs Jeff!!!!
Really well timed this. Been slacking on delt exercises and reintroduced them, gave me a few more options! 💪
Mr. Jeff, thank you 💯
Naturally 👌 😉
Congrats on 4m Jeff!!
The top two bodybuilding channels together 🔥
Dr. Mike is a good dude. Learned new things, thank you guys 💪
This team up is epic and I want more
5:42  Very questionable hand raising
Goddamn, what's up with this gym? Dimes with phat asses everywhere!
Insanely informative video with a actual studies to back those exercises up. Going to share this to my bros.
Super-ROM reverse cable flye, "it won't cost you a ton of reps", but it will cost you wrinkles 7:34
"I changed my mind!" hahaha that's funny af
Two of my favorites in one video 👍🏼
hi Jeff please reply to me i have this question from 5 months and no one answerd me so please answer it , i have only dumbbells and barbell so should i do dumbbell kickback or no because everyone says that it is a bad exercise
idk why but that shot at 0:12 killed me
Babe wake up new Jeff Nippard video dropped.
A machine the size of a squat rack used for a single exercise, the shoulder press, which can be easily replicated with dumbbells and a bench? Wow, in what gym?
10:41 lmao
Do biceps
9:47 😂
Lmao changing your mind when Antoine's attention was called. Same Jeff, same
Jeff the type of guy to plan clan wars using science
Answer - be a manlet.
Sig feil at 5:41 😂 jk
I dont have a gym/cable machine as I travel a lot for business, I mainly use dumbbells and bands ... still ok to do the cable exercised with bands instead?  PS. I think Dr Mike is a bit of a saddist.
Great tips 👌 thank you
Love this. No matter how long you’ve been in the gym scene, there’s always something to learn
Super ROM side delts basically lu raises ( chinese olympic lifter )
More videos with you two, please!!!
This was amazing, best shoulders video I’ve seen
The fact that he says at around 5:05 «dont thumbs up too much, keep the pinky up, it activates the side delts more» is a LOAD OF BS. This is asking for shoulder inpingement. Its much better to lean forward a bit to align the side delt muscles better for activation
lol the thumbnail vs the guy in video XDDDDDDD
I swear this duo is perfection. Please do more videos like that, you're awesome guys <3
Great video thx ❤
I studied so much back training, that i simply don't hit rear delts, cause they are huge, its kind of discusting compared to side delts
Personally, i naturally inject trenbolone
Fake natty
SWEEP ALL OF THE MONEY😂😂
Love this collaboration 🤝
00:01 Side delts should be the main focus of delt training, comprising 70-90% of training volume. 01:21 Seated machine exercises for 3D delts provide stability and increased tension 02:42 The overhead press is an effective exercise for front delts. 03:58 Thumbs up motion activates the side delt more effectively than thumbs down motion. 05:25 Cross body cable wire raise is the number one exercise for side delt development. 06:57 Reverse pec deck is the top pick for rear delts training 08:24 Sweeping motion for maximum delt activation 09:52 To build 3D delts naturally, use machine exercises and focus on front and rear delt movements.
I was very interested In hearing what he had to say about the OHP. Too bad it didn’t make the cut. 😢
You've earned one of my rare thumbs up👍
just a casual Antoine walking arounding being thor in the background
Damnit Jeff I thought I invented the cross body lateral cable raise😂😂😂 it's so so good
Extremely helpful video! Thank you so much
I love dr Mikes training style with his witty humor
I guess those who built them un-naturally technically did it using science too just not very well-advised science 😂
so that roid monkey basically stole Lu Xiaojun's Lu raises and renamed it super ROM lateral raises
I would love to see a full series with these two and each video starts with a cheesy 90s sitcom style intro
I'd rather see alternatives with free weights. I travel regularly between my home town and... well work town and the gyms I visit have various machines to a degree, but thankfully what they have in common is solid arsenal of free weights, squat racks and deadlift platforms which is why I prefer free weights to machines and cables. It's fun, convenient and I don't have to worry if I have to think if X machines is not present in Y gym... What can I do to substitute Z exercise.. Sooo... I guess rear delt fly or something in that matter will supplement OHP well.
5:43 I had no idea he was German
I'm here for the awesome content... And also the random Antoine cameo.
These guys have more chemistry than me and the girl whom i think i'm gonna score
9:01 holy shit you can see his forearm muscles making waves, that is hella dope ngl
I can’t break this down into one comment! Hard work,discipline!
Had to get Mike on to promote full ROM to balance out the Long Length Partial video haha.
Great tips and thanks for breaking it down well! Love it
Nice Jeff❤😮😊
The collaboration we didnt know we were missing till it was done.  Mike and Jeff..Woo Hoooo!!
we need a standard push day and pull day from both of you. Awesome duo, please feature him often.
blessed to have this video thank u Jeff
With all the research on long-length partials, what does the science say on going “super rom” on the front/side raises?
5:24 zesty Jeff
3:01 using dumbbells on an inclined bench can be a good substitute for people without the machine
oouuh nice collab!
It wasn't "science" that built them, it was hard ass work
lets admit guys, without these 2 legends we all would be skinny b*tches
first health club 🙌🙌🙌
“Dr” lmao looks like an average meat head
I love when the "natty" guys are just as big as the guys who are openly on gear.
(Using science) be less gay
Jeef you give me some hack or trick  When I perform DB lateral raises I don't feel pump jeef can you help me  Coz I want big shoulder ❤❤❤😊
Reaching out like that reverse pec deck cue also helps me feel my side delts with lateral raises. I have such a hard time feeling my side delts and not my traps
Let me take you from DADBOD to DADDY! Sign up for Jason Blaha Coaching now!!!
The combo no one asked for learning workouts, but man! Deadliest combo
I only milk my eccentrics! 😮
100/10 video❤💯
Man that reverse Pec Dec cue though😂😂
Dr Mike looks like English version of Guruji Mukesh Gahlot
hey man I just wanna say that if you grit your teeth like that the next time you go to a good dentist they're gonna notice how your teeth are going to crap, consider changing up the teeth gritting or wearing some kind of mouth guard to save your teeth.
“Do one from the rear” 😂
For anyone who hasn’t played around with tempo, I highly suggest doing so. Whether its pauses at the top/bottom of the motion or slowing down the eccentric/concentric parts of the motion.  Did a 3230 tempo on bb squat three days ago and i still feel it
how much reps and sets should i do for each muscle on the shoulder, and each movement in a workout.
a lot of baddies at this gym
Awesome video
Love whenever Dr. Mike collabs with other fitness influncers, always a fun watch
Underrated rear delt exercise: Use a band mounted behind you, bring it under one armpit and grab it with the opposite hand. Insane tension.
Question.. what if we grab the bar from upside to do the movement rather than from grabbing from Down to do the front delt excercise 2.??
This was such a cool and wholesome video but still getting them gains! Dr. Mike is freaking huge! It was also nice seeing Antoine Vaillant make a few brief appearances as well. Amazing content as usual!
The chemistry is off the charts. So fun to watch, so knowledgeable, and I was just looking for new delt exercises and tips. I will be coming to this again and again. Thanks so much
Why do you need to contract your triceps during every deltoid movement? I don't think so.
Hmmm....I'd slightly disagree with Mike about rear-delt training. If you're doing predominately vertical pulling, this isn't going to develop your rear-delts, traps and rhomboids to the point where you can afford to not prioritise hitting the rear-delts directly with a decent amount of volume. They contribute quite a bit to the 3D look as well. The best results I've gotten is starting my 'Pull' sessions with 2 rowing movements, followed by a vertical pull and concluding with direct rear-delt and upper-back work like face pulls and flye variations. Rows hit your upper back and rear-delts so much better than pull-downs or pull-ups in my experience. Combined with upright, seated presses and laterals you can't go wrong.
Being 3 feet tall helps.
I can't be the only one to recognize Antoine Vaillant here, right?  https://www.youtube.com/@AntoineVaillant
3:34 “Cameraman being a Man of Culture” moment
Just when you think you're already learning so much from Dr Mike, he pull another wisdom. This guy is a legend.
That dude is legit hilarious
aren't the "super rom lat raises" basically Lu-Raises?
Nah these 2 need to do more work together! This is great chemistry.
Do every body part with dr mike. This is good stuff
You 2 compliment each other extremely well. Love this collab, keep ‘em comin Jeff!
Do more with Mike. He's a fucking legend.
Pump does not necessarily mean growth…
One of the best bodybuilding videos ive seen in Youtube in a while. Even though hundreds are uploaded daily.
Damn it, why did i watch this just after my shoulder sesh… sheeesh
Had to stop it about halfway through.  I don't go to a gym.  Freeweights in the basement.  Dip and pull up bars. I skip over most videos utilizing machines
"by having 3cm long muscles"
Great vid Nice haircut!
It's wild that all these Queues are 100% intuitive and crazy simple, alas l, the human ego allows such a vast range of shithousery
Dr. Mike is a legend 💯
Still have my doubts that you've never once cycled on some gear. Had my doubts for a long while, but I'm also aware of physiological limits to muscle building. Not sure why people feel the need to lie. All of the most successful coaches take steroids and don't deny it, like Joey "Swoll"
you are not natural dont lie pls
Diet breaks or continuous dieting
3:34 camera guy knows whats up😂
The super rom lateral raise is also called the 'Lu Raise'
Jeff and Mike complete each other.  Great collab again
I LOVE DR.MIKE for many reasons.
That end shot with Mike posing is insane. Dude’s legs are wider than his waist. Bro’s a rhino.
Is this good for beginner lifters or should they just stick to the basics first(e.g. Cable/Db lateral raises etc.) before incorporating these?
A super rom lateral raise is what I call my impingement activator.
Honestly been working out and consuming a lot of content and I learned a ton that video ❤
Naturally?
I want you to give me 3D head (using science)
Jeff and Dr. Mike is such a good duo
Dr. Mike is so big he looks fat in a t shirt, bro is huge
We need more Dr Mike and Jeff
Jeff, you are the man. I’m watching before bed and can’t wait to try these in the morning! Thank you!
I think a modern day reboot of Pumping Iron should star you two.
Not really a fan of taking advice from anyone who's enhanced. It's like taking advice from someone who plays games on easy mode.
When will you build yours?
The mid delt raise look similar to the Lu Raises by weightlifting champion Lu Xiaojun
Thanks!!!!
The girls in background 😮
I love when Dr. Mike and you collab. My two favourites! Also, congrats on 4M 🎉🎉.
the front raise that they are doing is also good because it trains the lower traps which helps with scapular stability.
That's a side and front deltoid. Proving this guy is an idiot.
Is this how you built them, or is this how you *would* if you started over?
I always like the idea of the Lu Raises (called super-ROMs here) but I needed a doctor's opinion, this is it! I'm adding Lu raises to my program now
5:42 oh boy, that scared me
Good stuff Jeff!
How can you apply lengthened partials to side delt training?
I enjoyed the outtakes 🤌🏻
This was a fun collab. Love to see you with Jared as well
Dr. Mike is so awesome cuz he is hilarious and extremely knowledgeable
Ok so Dr Mike not implementing LPs
Haha it's nice to have Antoine Vaillant to just casually walk into a camera lol Also kudos to mentioning 7 heads of delts - Poliquin was teaching that for a long time. The only thing I have hard time accepting are the lateral raises above shoulder height: that makes acromium put too much pressure on supraspinatus no?
I've been training for years and I learnt a LOT from this video. Nice work!
Will apply the full rom up when doing front delt raises - looks like is going to be a game changer.
Hey Jeff, do you have any videos in injuries such as sciatica and how to recover? thx
Great video! You two make an amazing team. I bet it was killing Mike to keep it PG😂
Dr.  Mike is the man. Would love to see Jared Feather on here as well
That reverse fly cue is gold. Love Mike
Using heavy weights on lateral raises is the scary part. As with skullcrushers, I’d rather do heavy volume reps with light weights rather than risk some stupid injury like tennis elbow or shoulder impingement, which not only destroys a pleasant shoulder day workout but also chest day workout for weeks together.
Those full ROM lateral raises are nuts. I did my normal sets and normal range of motion with my 20's, then decided to try full ROM woth 10's, and i struggled to get 5 reps. Ill have to do those first next time cuz damn son
I thought i hit shoulders today, turns out..... I didn't 😭😭😭😭
Guys, we are not all blessed to have unlimited cash to join such a flash gym I don't know why Jeff doesn't show us the 'at home' exercises?! Front delts: Seated incline shoulder press. Lateral delts: Dumbbel flyes. Rear delts: Lying prone on bench: dumbbell flyes to the rear.
QUADS HAMMIES AND CALVES!!!
As natural as a pink gorilla
dat hamstring tho, Mikes a beast
toooop tips
“Overtime”
My 2 faves back at it again, Im gonna have a great night at the gym
You definitely used steroids Jeff, you're not natty
IceCream4PR's PODCAST BABY!
Dude nobody will have that first machine, don't even talk about it.
Mike the real deal, bravo
Phenomenal video!
Dr. Mike and Jeff are like those 2 science project toppers who can  literally throw us Outta class
What do I do if I have inner elbow pain when doing the front bar raise for the front delt ?
Yo congrats on 4mil subscribers!
Actually it was nice. Gentle. And informative
Very insightful, thank you
I couldn't focus too many muscle mommies
Mike is such a cool dude 😂
What an awesome and wholesome video from 2 of the goats of fitness and bodybuildong comunnity!!
Sucks being 6'8.5 knowing ill never be able to attain a natty physique like jeff without roids. 😢
9:20, completely agree, milking the last negative always give you the best feeling and growth
Tricep workout please
Casual Antoine Vaillant there at the end
Jeff: "Do it from the rear" Dr Mike: 😏👀
CAN YOU DO UPPER CHEST NEXT?
Such a wholesome video with this juicy & thicc father/son combo just picking up & putting down heavy things together. In all seriousness, J Nip gives the BEST science-based workout advice, as does Dr Mikky - thank you for all the content!
I like Mike 💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼
Man this video was a really great one just like the other ones but I will definitely implement this movement to my shoulder training thanks!
thanks both.
Dudes Wore sleeves probably in like forever to do a shoulder collab video. They are a menace and I love it.
Bro changed thumbnail and now I feel compelled to watch the video
Science based work outs have not served you best. You still don't have it figured out 😮
I've basically narrowed down my weightlifting content to Jeff and Dr. Mike. What else do you need? Just such a wealth of knowledge, research, and best practices with 0% bullshit.
I would watch, like, 4 seasons of a show that was just Jeff and Mike running a record store or some shit
That 45 - 135 is kinda where GOB suggests you stay.
Super tips! Thanks for sharing! Would be nice to see a full calf edition!
Not a commonly know fact, yet Jeffs main gain in chests development are coming mainly from his closing-video clap.
Jeff I feel like you were the one who put Dr Mike on the map years ago. It’s amazing to see how far he’s come, he deserves it. His lifting philosophy really elevated my training and helped me make sense of proper technique and progressive overload, and he’s one of the funniest people on the planet. Good to see you doing some training videos with him, I’d love to see more!
Amazing video.
The angle you are using for reverse cable flyes are totally different from Mike's angle in reverse flies. That's an issue in the video because it causes confusion.
Really enjoyed this vid!
First exercise I love… is a machine press that 99.999% of yall will not have access to. Lol😂
Bro are you from Grand falls?
Be 5'4", use gear (naturally), do shoulder exercises.
Part 2 for bicep and triceps2
Hi I’ve gotten my back wider but only in the upper lats is there any exercise to fill or round the lower lats? I do weighted pull-ups barbell rows,db rows and chin-ups.
Dr Mike is the goat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to7y50jfa5M
Pretty sure I sent you a mental message to plead for this video to happen... Great video, I like the guest too, that's a fun aspect.
Loved the tips from dr mike, would love to see you guys do an overview on traps, I find them pretty challenging to hit
Needed this, incredible value offered here. Thanks Jeff & Mike ❤
Jeff's like the Dr Stone of weight lifting. Doing everything with science. Good job.
Wonder how much of mikes swearing and banter got cut :’)
I'M A DISGUSTING FAT F*CK AND I NEED TO GET FIT AGAIN AAAAAAAAAH
Sees Antione, I changed my mind 😂
Jeff finally admits he's on something! I knew he was using science! Always had my suspicion.
Mike's the coolest guy in the fitness industry
5:42 pause
This collab is legendary!!
great stuff, thank you Jeff and Mike!
Interesting. I never thought rear delts were overrated. I thought the opposite
Was that Antoine Valliant @ 10:42 ?? lol
What's your upright row opinion?  I've found ways to do it without any shoulder discomfort, but it still seems like I'm the only one doing it.  Which is weird cause it works so well.
I love Dr. Mike bro but if he hopped on gear to look like this 0:09 then it proved to all you youngsters to stay natty get jacked over time and enjoy life. Guy looks so bad hahahaha.
Great collab guys
He is on Steroids
Great Video!Notes taken !going to implement these in my workouts.thanks Mike & Jeff💪🏽
Despite being weak as hell coming out of surgery Mike's science has changed everything about my training over the past few years and the results of it as well, with some muscle groups finally developing where they never have before.  Always super happy to see him promoted more. Such a generous master of his craft giving away this level of knowledge for free. And what a sense of humour, and so handsome! Oh my.
This collab was too good to be true.
This man the goat of science backed training
Antoine vaillant? 10:40
dont get it, 90% of the volume should be done to the side delts but here we dont do it?
For the side delts, couldn’t you have the cable go through your legs and sweep up while on an angle?
3d delts are bad for you & youre not natty
My rotator cuffs started hurting from just watching this video
I just pick side delts to train.
My front delts are the worst, because my chest is also lacking, and doesn't grow easily either.  I hate the constant assumption that everyone has good front delts due to being trained with the chest. So I'm glad to see some focus on it for once.
Free view of Dr. Mike’s glutes was a big plus. Good stuff ❤
Antoine with Cameo!!
RP been getting a lot of love lately
How do we build them unnaturally
My guy you don't have impressive shoulders honestly. Good content as usual tho. Keep it up!
Less goooo big J uploaded 👌👌
If you dont like Mike, you are the problem
Dr. Menno Henselmans proposes not to pause at the bottom, but to actively try to utilize the bounce from the stretch reflex as this maximizes mechanical tension in the most stretched position - with the caveat of possibly higher injury probability.
So you built your shoulders with these exercises that you just learned?
That's a pretty sweet gym! Wish I had one around like that.
4:35 that’s adorable HAHAHA
I have pain in my wrist when doing any type of lateral raise with pronated grip (due to a TFCC tear over a year ago).  If I do them with a neutral grip, will I still be significantly hitting the side delt, or does that turn it into a front delt dominant exercise, and I should just find a different exercise for side delts?  (I think the only one left is upright rows which I've heard negative things about)  And also I've tried a wrist widget, and it didn't help
HOW DO YOU PEEL YOUR KIWIS! I’ve been doing it different every day of my life, I feel so lost
Nice video, Mike was so flirty
The best to guys youtube have to offer in the fitness department
THAT was an AWESOME  collaboration!! Double Kudos 🎉
I just noticed: In your Gym work out so many beautiful Girls :D Really enjoyed your background :)
My biggest takeaways from Jeff + Mike’s crossover content have been to slooooow down and get as deep into each stretch as possible. Feels like those two things have greatly improved the effectiveness of my training almost overnight. Thanks for all that you do, fellas!
Jeff built 3D delts by being a manlet.  Don't kid yourself.
Great video. Hope to see more collaborations with dr mike
Jeff and Mike the power couple we never knew we needed
Dr. Mike is a joker but his knowledge in training is unmatched.
3D delts?
Bringing a roider into a "how I built 3d delts naturally" lol, into the trash it goes
At the beginning he says he'll show 1 exercise for each and then 2
Including the Dr Mike being Dr Mike section was a great idea 😂
Jeff isn’t natural. BS
Only attractive women there
Love Dr. Mike❤
Do you have these exercises in your push pull legs new program?
What about just dumbell home workouts?
Dr. Mike is a goldmine. Love both of your content!
Jeff, please re do the instructional video in your latest program for the Super ROM lateral raise
Jeff and Dr. Mike are the Batman and the Superman of hypertrophy 💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼
You used science alright. Laboratory science.
First step: be 5’4
Jeff looks like he’s taking stuff when he stands next to mike
Side delt exercise is similar to Lu raises. And I feel my side delts more on lu raises
Mike is the perfect combination of ol school meat head, new school science lifter, and kid trapped in a mans body.
Mike needs to move to Canada, and do collab with the Mike from that GYM :)
it's great to see more mike content
The youtube gods are good today
That superROM reverse cable fly looks insane. I'll try this next.
Camera man distracted by cute girl at 3:36 hahahahaha
Dr. Mike over here making references to his own videos on Jeff Nippard's channel. He just did a "what muscles to look jacked" video and #1? Shoulders~
I love both of you guys, & Dr. Mike does not look like an oddly muscled boss baby with his little shorts rolled up in diaper form.
The best is incline bench press, bench press, another bench press and then bench press
It’s impossible to focus on what Jeff is saying from min 1:18 to 1:46  Need IG 🍑
Jeff u ain't natural lmao
HELL YEA MIKE
Dr. Mike more like Dr. Huge 💪
Love dr mike
A great cameo from Antoine Vaillant checking out your delts!!! 😎
That is the most rowdiest shoulder press machine I’ve seen . Holy shit !
Dr Mike is so cool! Never seen him before. He's so passionate
Love you both!!!
Great video!
6:34 I'd give my front delt to have Dr.Mike tell me I have beautiful control and that's awesome.
This was a really great video! Super informative! I’ve been struggling with hitting/activating my rear delts. Just implemented the advice you guys said in the video and had a great workout! Look forward to trying the front and side delt info next time!
I think this is the first time I've heard Dr. Mike not refer to himself as a 'short king'.  Thank God.
I’d love to see a masterclass video on Lats next
by being 5'2
Let's go brother 👏🏋‍♂️🔥
Great video and timing! I want to focus on my delts in my next training phase.
Allright.. I know what I'm going to do next..
Jeff even brushes his teeth in a science based manner
Now how Antione valiant make a lil appearance at the end😭😭😭
This what hobbits looked like after War of the Ring.  No shade. Am also hobbit.
I have very poor shoulders, over developed front delts and lacking side and posterior delts.  Im focusing very hard on it now, for the last month atleast
Everytime I think about a lagging muscle group and what to do about it, boom a brand new Jeff nippard upload
Fantastic tips! 👏👏👏
I'm a simple man. I see Dr. Mike, I smash that mf like button
I do a version on the Super ROM side laterals on the dual arm cable machine but from the lying position! Mainly to keep tension cause I feel at some point with DBs you loose tension! (Edit) its kind of a combo between side E1 and side E2.
I have been watching your videos for years and I absolutely loved this one because of the “bloopers” at the end. Makes it feel more real and enjoyable. Thanks again for great content Jeff💪🏼
0:21 Deficit Pushup, i love it they are really humbling because if you do them correctly thay are hard af
Love the fizzy combination of Jeff's calmness and mike's rizz periodization 😂   This channel just lost its virginity and innocence and i will never be able to see it the way i did before this video 🔥😅
Wait, i thought the dumbbell press was more of a side delt exercise since with the dumbbells you can go all the way to the side of your delts (or not, depends on the flexibility) and raise the dumbbells from there. And the y raise is a fantastic side delt exercise, it litterarely gives me an physchotic pump while the dumbbell lateral raise is just... idk, i only feel my side delts fatigued, but the pump is like a 1.5/10 so idk.
3D science deltz?!? I'll believe it all yo
I have a beginner question, is a SuperRom Lateral Raise the same as a Lu Raise?
Yes. Core.
What a crossover
Dr Mike rules!
The Super ROM lateral raises reminds me of the Lu raises (the butterfly like side laterals made famous by Olympic weight lifting legend Lu Xiaojun).
Dr. Mike must be 7ft 500 pounds
Mike is the GOD
Great Thanks to you and the doc
I've incorporated the side and rear delt cable movemenbts shown a couple of months ago with noticeable gains. i have just learned a couple of tweaks that will definitely make these movements next level. thank you
Dr. Mike is just the best.
This video just made me want be friends with mike and jeff lol
is this real?? literally every girl in the background of the video looks like a fitness model
pure muscle is amazing gym
It's cool to see Dana White hang out with Jeff.
Uh, you didn't build those naturally. You are as natural as a plastic bottle.  true story
Being natural and standing next to Dr Mike and looking so good... awesome Jeff
amazing video as always jeff. happy to see Dr Mike in the video two
How much would you benefit from sitting on an upright bench for the rear cable flies to avoid cheating? Or is it better to just use a lighter weight and control it yourself?
Mike is a comedian lmao
I needed this video so badly. I hate doing shoulder workouts and definitely needed to reevaluate what exercises I do for them. The super-ROM lateral raise is absolutely going into my incline-press circuit.
love to see you 2 guys working together, I watch both of you for good info and to always learn more. Been lifting for 16 year and still learning more every day.
Mike!
Everyone in this gym is jacked af lol.
It is amazing: everyone who training with Dr Mike start implementing his cues to his training. I'm really glad I've stumbled upon you two during my lifting and studying journey
crazy quality in your vids, always a must see
2 videos in a month?? am i dreaming?
Love this collab! 2 of the best in the space, amazing knowledge
Mike coaches negatives like I train my dog to take a treat. Slightly threatening "slow, slow, Slooow"
8:30 Same for the pectoral variant of the machine. Always ‚over stretch‘
1st exercise looked more chest focused
So its a science to look fit. But can you actually DO something bro? You spar any at all? Ever? Anything? A science on looking good? Is that not like what beauty salons do? So fkn fit n stong but cant throw a punch or defend a choke lol or am i wrong? Apologies if so
very cool
Funny thing, Im already doing exacly those xd
Antoine Vaillant getting called Thor then casually walking passed the camera at 10:40 is pure gold.
Rear and front delts are so overrated and you don’t need to train them. You train them anyways
The outtakes 😂
Please more videos with you and Mike, good chemistry while dropping knowledge 💪🏻
sell out for the 💉
9:26 darn, I wanted to hear those off camera analogies 😂
Jeff : lemme roll up my sleeves Antoine : 👀 Jeff : nevermind
Mike Israetel is a national treasure 🇺🇸
MY KING JEFF NIPPARD
Love when my two dads get together for some good ole muscle building tips
FUCKIN AD’s
These two = the perfect gains cocktail
im sorry the first person i thought of was Derek
I freaking love mike, awesome guy. He was the first I followed when I went into lifting and didn't miss a video to this day. The same for you Jeff
Dr Mike makes everything better ☺
Jeff favorite exercise are mine as well that's cool!
What if I want 4d delts
Wow he had some really eye opening tips! More of this please!
I have a graduate degree in exercise science and I still love watching these - thanks Jeff!
Blessed Daddy Jeff released this 30 mins before my shoulder workout
Jheeez ISSA BIG MON TING 🚫🧢💪💪💯
I love the Jeff and Dr. Mike collabs. Also, this gym always has beautiful women working out
Jheeez ISSA BIG MON TING 🚫🧢💪💪💯
Jheeez ISSA BIG MON TING 🚫🧢💪💪💯
U needs let Mike crack jokes he kills me 😭
Natural and roid collaboration is weird af
Love Dr. Mike and Jeff, two solid dudes.
Protraction for those reverse pec dec flies is a really good cue 😁
It's called an EZ-curl bar.  Not EZ-bar.
who doesn't know that front delts are overused? You do lean back/arch your back too much on shoulder press causing even more emphasis on your front delts. 11:11 , 1:34 so much that you and mike are basically doing upper pecs.
This shit was beautiful.
Don't forget the elite level genetics here, for the average drug free trainee, 3 shoulder exercises is too much. Overhead press is enough for most. And never train the the anterior delts, complete waste of time.
u have a dead pixel or two in this video :D
Antoine! 10:40
I cannot do full rom lateral raises without pointing my thumbs up or I get a massive pop in my left shoulder
Great coaching queues. I'm definitely going to use every one of these.
Antoine sighting @10:09 !
a perfect compliment, dr mike x jeff nipps. keep these collabs coming!
the most jacked 15 year old ----> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvNrmt-dZmo
Could u buy me a protein shake please. I am going through a tough time.
Awesome
Shoulder press  lateral raise Reverse fly
The collab we didn't know we needed....but are happy we got!!!!!
Bro Doc has no sense at all 😂😂😂😂 can’t to train with him
Adding, if none of the tips in the video work, you can try test and Deca for juicy shoulders/trapz
Guess us mere mortals walk around with 2d delts then
Naturally.
An entire series like this with Dr.Mike would be legendary
Is Mike natty
Just tried this after watching the video.  Crazy side delt pump!!!   Will add to my normal routine.
Heavy, Low lateral dumbbell swings. Keep em low and heavy. Shout out to Mountain dog...RIP
I love these guys! This video was very helpful to me and my journey. As a side note, I'd like to point out how humble and teachable Jeff is. To be a good leader, you also need to be a good follower. You need to be teachable. I am always impressed by how good of a student Jeff is even after all that he himself has accomplished and become.
Best Collab possible
You’re special Jeff, you have been able to bring the Science to an audience who would have normally rejected it.  You are now the go to Science guy for the general population. Even though you are not a research scientist you have done what many scientists have tried to do and failed, which is bring the real knowledge to the ‘bros.’  You have done it by…  1. Having the knowledge  2. Applying it and looking the part 3. And delivering both of the above in a professional and entertaining manner.  And if anybody denies it, 4M subs don’t lie with high viewership per video.  You are someone I look up to Jeff, you are one of my heroes. Thank you. 🤜
Mike is god in the fitness world. Love his training methodologies, love his humour, love him
Gold.
Come for the scientific training explanation, stay for the Antoine Vaillant cameo.
Great video! Awesome tips, you too rock together. I've been watching both of you channels for quite some time now. Great collab guys.
damn I thought he used resistance training to build muscle not science as they say you learn something new everyday 🤪
4:40 it this the same as LU lateral raises?
Thanks you guys for sharing lot of info with us  I really wanted to watch some video like this ❤
Excellent vid Jeff. 10:43  gave me a real laugh.
Dr. Mike...I'm disappointed you missed the obvious "breast stroke" analogy with the pec deck.
10:25 Every single time I do this exercise I have always considered the possibility of my nuts getting crushed so I'm always careful. 🤣
Hey Jeffrey, are you still dating that stephanie chick? Haven't seen her on ur channel recently and i miss that ass
lost me at seated machine shoulder press. Do your standing shoulder presses.
10:42 is that Antoine? 😂
jeff nipple, lol.
Jeff and Dr Mike are such a great pair, would love to see more videos of them together !
This had some wonderful cues. Great video!
I've been doing all my side delts with the cables. In fact you can just combine the "super ROM" exercise that Mike mentioned with a cross-body cable lateral raise and kill two birds with one stone.
Jeff -" step 1 to 3 D delts , buy my bodybuilding/hyperthropy 40€ program"  Also Jeff :" powerbuilding good for muscle building "
loved the bloopers/b-roll at the end, would love to see more of that in the future too!
Watching your videos makes working out fun and informative, thank you Jeff 😊
Think about if Jeff did a tiny little cycle of juice dude would be fuckin yoked
Is this in response to Dr. Mike’s video on what muscles make you look the biggest?
First rule - Be short. Second rule - have a good workout & Nutrition.
I compare the side delt movement to a golf swing as you always use the leading arm for power the trailing is for direction.
Mike is such a troll.
What an era we living in such a crazy information for free of cost ❤ love jeff and Dr .RP for india
OHP emphasis and high volume rows are all you need, not all these fancy movements.
I was a swimmer through college that helped shape my shoulders and back massively!
Weird hack for rear delts I figured out accidentally. Single arm rope face pulls. If you struggle to connect to your rear delts, give these a shot, especially if you have imbalances. I've never felt such a strong contraction as I do with these. Downside is they take twice as long to perform since they're unilateral, but since rear delts recover quickly you can almost just switch sides without any rest between sets.   I get rotator cuff tightness from doing too many reverse pec deck or cable pull apparts for rear delts, but never have issues with face pulls (plus they hit your rotator cuff and make your shoulders feel nice).
Love Dr Mike more videos with him please!
My 2 favorite BBers coming together. Great video Jeff and Mike!
Most people use analogies to relate to a normal, familiar situation, but doctor mike will come up with the most insane shit you’ve ever heard, like wtf was that money pile example hahaha
Can remember if I got it from a RP video but I've been doing that for the rear delt fly for the last year.
Do this kind of video for all body parts we love Dr Mike
High quality content right here. I’ll be incorporating these exercises right away!
Gr8 vid bro love it 🙌😘❤️🤝
Nipp Jeffard
great video :)
@AntoineVaillant cameo! That would be a fun collab
4:26, you love to see it. We all like Dr mike
no upright rows :(
Good stuff 👍🏽
My fav short king duo!
You can do db front raises on an incline bench to get a similar effect of the stretch that dr Mike mentioned
😂😂😂
gratz for 4 mil
This was wonderful. Definitely wouldn’t mind more of this
Insane tips! My shoulders got a pump doing these exercises even without using any weights, can't wait for my next shoulder day
Dr. mike 🙌🏼
10:09 almost thought it was Jay Cutler. Unrelated, full ROM side-delts (exercice 2) feels awfully shitty for me considering my bad shoulder mobility. I'm 6'1 with long ass arms and I can't keep a straight, constant stretch like Jeff does (going past the ears, for example).
Bhai batle ho aap 🥰🫂
Mike's head is huuge 😮
Great stuff as always Jeff, and even bigger dude, who seem a bit familiar ;) My deserted island dreams just got new fuel.
Guessing we both got the cross body cable lateral from John Meadows (RIP)?
5:42 I'm shocked 😮 you changed jeff
I really enjoyed it! Nice tips
“You’re my number one” 🥹🥹🥹
The Mr. Know it all Dr resorted to juice lol.
The lu raises are similar
2:54....the video goes to the next level!😂
7:47      "waayyy harder" 😂
I start with rear delts to open up my old joints and then focus on side delt with a ton of volume and then end with front. It’s working 😊
Absolute kings of the fitness influencer industry. Love these collabs
Just cause i did my shoulder workout yesterday. I could easliy be a Nippard video guesser, lol. Great content and cues tho, loved it and i'll use it on next workout!
pure gold
That first shoulder machine looks amazing. Never seen one like that before.
Do this for each body part!!
Can we have nat guys in these videos, please.
Good stuff.
Just in time for my upper body session later today.
Just move some goddamn weight No need to science the shit out of something simple for clicks Smh
Not science 💀
Haven’t watch the video yet, I’m gonna preemptively guess that he built his delts by training them and eating a good diet.
LATERAL RAISES, LATERAL RAISEMACHINE, LATERAL RAISES PARTIALS
Your genetics are kinda insane
I feel like Mike can do comedy for a niche audience, he is really hilarious.
Maybe one of your best videos.
But does mo’ round 3D delts equals mo’ btches?
More mike! He is a knowledgeable monster.
"naturally"
lol. Mike seems like such a wholesome guy here. But then a new viewer goes to his channel and hears his crude humor. Lol
Great video and great information! Can't wait to try this today! Boulder shoulders day! 💪🏽 💪🏽
Spent more time editing the thumbnail than video length itself.
“Naturally”
Me: Today is an off day.  My Delts: You thought.
Guy I have a question how much oz of water should I be drinking I weight about 220?
The two of you are THE BEST sources of information on this realm. Phenomenal duo for this video.
@0:22 jeff who's that beautiful lady? 😮
Doing front raises on an incline bench or leaning backwards hits the front delts even more with a bigger range of motion.  Thanks for the content Jeff and Mike!
Awesome video, perfect vibes with Mike. Could you consider making a series with Mike for each body part?
Excellent training. Liked the reverse flies w cables
Dr. Mike and Jeff collabs will always be a good time.
A combined 8x8 feet of height and width between these two XD. Solid guys.
Love the co-labs with Dr. Mike! Maybe hit chest next?
Great vid !! Got a few tips 🎉
Reverse pec deck is so good but I can't do it anymore ever since i hurt something along the lines of acromioclavicular joint i think is called..? Only rows and neutral grip reverse flyes now on a lower angle😂..
I've heard the 'super ROM lateral raises' refered to as 'Lu Raises' named after the weightlifter
Jeff: "Side delt training should account for 70-90% of shoulder training"  Also Jeff: **Makes side delt exercises account for 20% of shoulder training video**  Jokes aside- Great content
Hey, Jeff nice to see you again! Are you sure you have no plans for an ASMR channel? Lol.
best side delt exercise is single-arm-behind-neck smith machine press
Any thoughts on side-inclined dumbbell lateral raises? In theory those maximize the tension as the muscle is maximally lengthened rather than normal lateral raises where the tension is maximized as the muscle is most contracted.
10:40 Antoine Vaillant!
That B roll at the end was AMAZING.
Awesome Jeff! I'm hitting those exercises asap 🔥
The outtakes! ❤❤❤
I feel these guys have great chemistry yet are very different- perfect recipe for a “buddy cop” sort of video.
Awesome video. I replicated the movements on my tonal and they are 🥇.
Those squats were great , I loved the the tempo and the re-racking tehnique . Such marvelous movement from top to bottom.  Awesome video as usual! Keep it up!
lu raises are the king
Dr Mike , Jeff and Omar is some of the top collabs ever happened on fitness YouTube . Following all of you
Fake natty manlet
I sometimes have trouble remembering to control the negative and go slower. Sometimes I’m feeling so much discomfort that I want to just get a set over with. And I think that I accidentally hold myself back from pushing myself if I have enough energy to reach failure. I’m getting better at it though some advice on some tricks for these problems would be appreciated.
Nice!!
I can't believe how lucky I am, getting these colabs with Dr. Mike and Jeff. Those two channels are the only bodybuilding content I need.
looooool more videos with dr mike
Can't believe you didn't consult with delt daddy Derek
I LOVE DR MIKE ISRAETEL I LOVE DR MIKE ISRAETEL I LOVE DR MIKE ISRAETEL I LOVE DR MIKE ISRAETEL I LOVE DR MIKE ISRAETEL I LOVE DR MIKE ISRAETEL I LOVE DR MIKE ISRAETEL I LOVE DR MIKE ISRAETEL I LOVE DR MIKE ISRAETEL I LOVE DR MIKE ISRAETEL I LOVE DR MIKE ISRAETEL I LOVE DR MIKE ISRAETEL I LOVE DR MIKE ISRAETEL I LOVE DR MIKE ISRAETEL I LOVE DR MIKE ISRAETEL I LOVE DR MIKE ISRAETEL I LOVE DR MIKE ISRAETEL I LOVE DR MIKE ISRAETEL I LOVE DR MIKE ISRAETEL I LOVE DR MIKE ISRAETEL I LOVE DR MIKE ISRAETEL
Damn, Dana White really knows his stuff.
Wow simply just wow bro you are doing a excellent and brilliant thing by making this video and telling about how you built 3d delts naturally and keep it up and keep up the good work as always and take care  Keep smiling always
Man, this posted right after my push day
Isolateral, not unilateral. You CAN do unilateral press (one arm) on the machine, but it's an isolateral machine.
With access to Jeff, Mike and a few others, no one should train poorly. What we would have given for this information back in the day.
04:37  ayooooo Dr Mike 😂😂❤
Great nod to John Meadows with that fanned out cable lateral raise.. I love seeing different YouTubers use the techniques that he used, whether it was learned from him or not, it's a great way to keep the memory of him alive for me.
10:53  this posing side by side right here  is all the motivation i'll ever need to stay natty
"Goodby front delts"...  Boy Dr Mike sure knows how to sell 'em.
As an Italian I’ll give Dr Mike a pass. Because he did the hand sign when he said it.
From 9:36 on is GOLD
10:40 A wild Antoine appears!
I find doing the machine press without arching my back as much it kills my side delts a bit more with less front delt and chest emphasis.
Jeff, you ever think of doing a really heartfelt “How far I’ve come since day one” video? 4 million subscribers is crazy man. Been watching you since day 1 💯🙌🏽🙏🏽🔥
Oh yeah daddys talk to me science
Dr. Mike and Jeff are such a dangerous duo. Great tips & so much research and expertise.
two of the best minds in muscle science, what a blessing for us. love to see it.
That gym is awesome
just listen to kevin levrone and phil heath, they are the goats of delts
triceps PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!!
Dr. Mike has literally changed my entire training for the better. He’s such a wealth of knowledge and for the most part I think he’s probably one of the top fitness channels and everyone should consider checking it out. My muscles and training have improved drastically
My workout week is off due to the holidays so I said about 10 minutes ago "What should I work today? Maybe I'll do shoulders." Get back to my desk and open YouTube and this is the first video on my feed. LOL Guess the signs are there.
I love, how, Jeff Nippard is the reason I discovered Dr. Mike more than half a decade ago due to his round-table discussions, but yet Jeff treats Dr. Mike almost like he's a new fan. You both have contributed immensely to my motivation to pursue evidence-based strength training knowledge.
At 1:30 during the front delt exercise, was that placing of your butt a bit more forward on purpose in order to hit the front delt more?
Really great vid thank you
Didn't think people even shorter than Dr Mike existed
Ahhh yes, thank you for uploading this after my shoulder day 5 hours ago 😂😢
I was literally sorting out my shoulder when jeff kick in
Haven't even started the video yet and I know its going to be great. Your videos are always packed with so much info and I am here for it. Also here for pumpkin delts soooo let's goooo
Jeff you just said in your last video that the most important part of the lift is the lenghted part, in this video the exercise chosen by Israetel really emphasize the shortened part (like the super rom latera raise or the reverse cable fly) Wouldn't be better to focus on exercise that load the stretch part of the delt more? I'm getting confused.
Make a video with Alberto again. Its been awhile 💪
Jeff and Mike together, love to see it
Congrats on the 4m!
A masterclass on training triceps would be awesome
Lui raises nice
blud is short
theres no magic behind. train front delt, side delt and rear dealt with one exercise, progressive overload it. thats it
Amar eyat gym burot  shoulder press, tar pisot dumbel front raise...tar pisot cable front raise mare kelaa

The kiwi kid is back!
