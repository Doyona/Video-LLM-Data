Please don’t overdo. I overdid when my daughter was born. I felt great and did so much more than I should have and I paid for it when I was in my 30’s. Ruptured disk and a lot of pain. Still in this pain 39 years later.  So please please don’t lift so many heavy buckets. Only because I care.  Pat in NC

Samantha Grace. What a lovely, traditional name. I'm so glad you both were safe! Benjamin is gonna be such a good big brother. Was she born on the 19th? My older sister was born on the 18th and my dad died on the 19th. These two days are very important to me. Anyway, congratulations! Stay safe and healthy!
How precious ...!!!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️

Awww. Congrats! She will be your new very best BFF in the entire world! Just like my daughter, coralann is and has been all of our 34 yrs together! She helps me in my garden too and with all my plants! She has a better eye than me sometimes for sickly plants in the discount aisles that we rescue and take home and try to save.  What a real real blessing! Wishing you and your family nothing but all good things and positive vibes!!!
I love her already! Congratulations! 💞💕

Congrats! Love her name.  Samantha and Benjamin great names!  I was 9 lbs 9oz 21 inches and my daughter too. But I am average height and my daughter is short and petite 5 ft. So birth weight does not equate to how they will end up. Just means you took real good care of yourself and ate well during pregnancy.
Congratulations! SUCH a wonderful blessing!

Awwwwe...congratulations! Baby is soooo precious.
Congratulations
Soooo beautiful ❤️ holy moly congratulations she’s a big baby but she’s a healthy one!!! Can’t wait to watch her grow up ☺️
Awww! She's such a beautiful chunker! My baby boy was 21 inches.  Idk if you seen my last comment- but You're mom is so right, when you get home to Benjamin he's going to seem to have grown 2 years! It happened to me with our adopted 6 year old (at the time) when we had our 1st biological baby...  (after trying for 10 years) 😫 I felt like he grew at least 2 years!
Congratulations she beautiful just like her momma❣️❣️❣️
Congratulation and all the best ❤️❤️

Oh my goodness she’s just wonderful!!! Congratulations! I know you don’t know most of us but we feel like we know you! I got tears in my eyes!! Thank you for sharing Samantha Grace with us. God bless you🥰
Is it me or does anyone else feel like they've been part of the whole "waiting for baby to arrive" party? Now that she's here, yay! Welcome, precious little one! Mamma looks good, too. I'm ok with you "oversharing" on the baby pictures.
Hesitated to mention this, but decided to anyway now that you named your second child, a daughter, with the same name as my second child. Your son, Benjamin, also touches my heart in a special way. I lost my first child before birth and his name is also Benjamin. Praying God's blessings over all of you.
Congratulations, she's a little angel and the perfect addition to your sweet family💕

So beautiful and I love her name.   My baby granddaughter  is Olivia Grace.  Grace was my mother's middle name too. I couldn't believe it when you Gave her weight and length.   My first son weighted.   9 pounds, 14 ounces and 21" long!... Brian slept thru the nite beginning with night #1 The nurses couldn't believe it,  they had to wake him so he could nurse and he wouldn't.    Just when back to sleep.    Brian Always slept thru the nite.   I was spoiled big time!!!   THEN I had Jason... 9#  6.5 oz.  21"   and he made up for Brian...  up at. 3 every nite and awake every Morning  at 6:00 an come hell or high water  till he started school. Then he didn't want to get up. The nurses fought over Brian to dress him to go home.   They said he was like a 3 month old and he fit in the 3 month old pj's. He wore the hat i knitted for him and  used the blanket. Sweater was too small 😖 Enjoy, enjoy enjoy!!!   Congratulations to you and Aaron and Benjamin.   She is beautiful just like her momma!!!  Love and prayers Mimi in Ohio

Please REFUSE any vaccines that they want to give your baby at the hospital. The Hepatitis B shot is the one they've been giving newborns for a while. it isn't really necessary, and it can cause harm to your baby. Ask for a copy of the information sheet that comes with the shot and read it. Ask about it soon because they like to give it between 12 and 24 hours after birth.
OMG! SO FAST!!! Congratulations my dear 🥰 She is just perfect and you are looking gorgeous 🎉
Congrats 💖💖💕

Awe she’s beautiful ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ thank you for sharing your bundle of joy with us. A BIG congratulations to momma and papa and of course Benjamin. He’s going to be so excited, and also maybe a little bit confused because now he has to share mommy and daddy. She’s precious. And now we know why she needed to make more room in her grow room, she’s a biggin’. My first was 9 lbs. and I thought he was big. I shared the floor at the hospital with a woman who had a 16 lb baby, can’t remember if it was a boy or girl but it was almost fully grown. JK. I’m thinking, thank goodness you had a c-section. Thank you again for showing us beautiful Samantha Grace, truly a gift from God. Love to you and your family💚🙃 P.S prayers for a speedy recovery because my days are just not the same without seeing Laura in the morning. Maybe I’ll need to watch your older videos to get my fix. Get some rest sweet child you deserve it💚🙃
Awe she’s beautiful!! You look great Laura,, congratulations you and your little family
SO happy for you guys!!!
She’s a sweet looking baby!  Congrats... take the next few weeks off. We can watch old episodes. You have MUCH more important things going on.

Congratulations, I'm so happy for you.  She is so beautiful!  Thank you for sharing.  I don't think I could have shared this with the world, but I'm of a much older generation.  I have been watching your videos for 2.4 years now (when I had a knee replacement) and I feel that you two, now 4, have welcomed me into your world, as you have become part of mine.  My 7th grandchild was born almost 3 weeks ago, so we are also feeling the joy a baby brings.  Enjoy her, they grow up too fast.❤️
