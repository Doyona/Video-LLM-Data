If they were onto points Fu and MJ would’ve let it pass buh its cute that they had to do it for the pairs its team work!!
This episode brokeee me!!🤣🤣🙌🏽😂
im trying to eat my cereal while watching this
I hate joyce so much she's annoying
When they was eating them fish eyes I was gagging just watching them I can’t imagine how bad they were 😭
31:32 not him casually enjoying the fish eyes
Madam Joyce saying they should have seasoned the cows tongue with so maggi is killing me😂😂(Any Ghanaians here)
Fav locked in episode in the interest culture of locked in
The stairs from fue are nightmare worthy
Juices determination is giving
this was the funniest challenge yet 😭😭😭
29:35 ash kills me everytime 😂
ICL this episode is so boring, i was watching in 2x speed and was still bored
1:11 Jocye is not a bad girl
joyce was over reating way to much
1:59 😂😂😂😂 Danny is a legend
This is soo funny
Fu “that cow gave blow to other cows with that tongue” LMAO 😂
Why does ash cake her face with so much makeup dang girl you probably have a bucket of paint on your face
Hiya mate
Hi
Kacis and ash’s bond is unbreakble and they don’t even know it. ❤
Joyce not liking all the attention on fu so makes a massive scene...shes an idiot
Seriously how did he get his shorts on that quick
Who agrees that Danny Kaci and ash are a good trio?! ❤
George was just chilling 😂
Danny telling George every food is delicious 😂😂😂😂
Kaci falling asleep on Ash is so cute!!!! 🥰🥰
maybe a bit late, maybe this already been said, but drinking brains gave them +iq
My sides were actually hurting from laughing at Fu during the eating challenge 🤣
Who ever put “ Joyce is jarring” get a grip like if you want ur bff with u u would eat anything Ik I would
Joys trying to tell her self is coco pops is hilarious
Watching this episode today i miss this series but the way ash is treating kaci when she is alsep stroking her head and leting her sleep on her is so nice
Oh fu I got PLEASUREEE OKAYYYY that was fucking funny
That scream from fu got my throat hurting from laughing so much
“Ireland your country Ireland 6 million RUSSIA 51 million”😂😂😂
this is the best season on locked in 👌👌🙌🙌🙌🙌
not the coco pops
Respect to fu. He's a legend for eating all of this foods fore kasi
Joyce should pack it up Her ass annoyin bruh
Madam Joyce: 'ITS COCOPOPS ITS COCOPOPS' 😂😂😂
19:38     Zombie Joyce
If you look at this comment your gay
There is no way mj got to the final even tho she was out first
Joyce is so annoying
what is there in roasted cricket and cow tongue tho? That is an African delicacy
honestly that scream from joyce almost made me click away.... stop shouting !!
This Joyce ting needs to be in the new planet of the apes
My favourite part of this episode is definitely how Fu looked at Danny straight in the eye and just gag 😂 and also how wholesome Fu and Kaci's friendship ❤
SubhanAllah Alhamdulilah Allahu Akbar SubhanAllah LA ILLAHA ILLA ALLAH MUHAMMAD SAWPBUH RASOOL ALLAH there is none worthy of worship except Allah ❤سبحان الله وبحمده سبحان الله العظيم
We don't even know whose brain 😂😂😂 36:09
I do this on a Monday morning had me rolling 😂
I couldn’t watch them suffer during the eating challenge
The man said , frog eyes 😂😂😂😅but it was fish eyes
George was eating it like he  really eat this thing before 😭💀 crazy 😧 guy with a strong stomach
Fu Izzy killed me with his screaming like a girl 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 food challenge 😭 madam Joyce was screaming crazy 🤪
😊
MJ would do anything for Ash and this challenge proves it ❤
Fu asks Danny what his tiktok following is to say that tiktok followers equals clout like tiktok fanbase is more loyal than youtube/streaming lol
danny is saying. Stoping make eyes contact with me😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
As an arab i used to eat the eyes of fish as a kid it wasn’t that bad
Joyce screaming was worse then fu izzy vomiting like broo shuuuuuutttttuppppp
"Im a real og bad girl you know" STFU JOYCE
George is a G, man didn't even flinch while both fu and Joyce were crying years. Well done 🔥🔥🔥
why Joyce be getting the bad comments? she became my favorite easily.
I love chicken heart it’s so good
In East Europe ..it's a delicatessy...I often cooked chicken hearts and cows tongue
😂😂😂😂😂
I didnt know if i wanted to cry of laughter or throw up everything i ate this morning
Feel bad for Fu, my fellow scouser suffering
George just bitting into everything, craaazzy!
FU AND JOYCE ARE KILLING ME I ACC CANT BREATHE
This is the best episode of locked in
Fu is broing 😂  should been gone day one eating haram food as well
Can't wait until they reveil that sugarlips is authur tv with a female voice changer
Watching the challenge while fasting makes me want to try all these weird things man 😂
Kac
Am crying from laughing 🤣🤣 it’s the eyes for me !! This is the best this season
They got next man eating haram food. Joke man
What was the point of the challenge when nobody got eliminated? I like Kaci but Fu didn't even eat the whole cow tongue she should've been eliminated.
MJ and Fu had me crying real tears 😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Joyce is the worst human on earth
Joyce just really doing the most
Bro how was george so calm in that food challenge
Joyce should have stayed out, thats all that needs to be said.
Chicken heart and cow tongue? Yall serving gourmet food and they need to eat it as a challenge? I fucking love chicken hearts and cow tongue is insanely tender and delicious
Bruv cows tongue is so good literally so soft and juicy they over reacting 😂
mj loves ash too much
That whole challenge was mostly arab food, food looks good icl
I love how everyone else is screaming and george is there munching everything down
Cow tongue is 🔥🔥🔥 it’s best in a taco. 24:42
Joyce screaming for her life for 10 min straight
Pls Fu and Joyce had me grasping for air their reactions were too funny and George took it like a champ. Honestly huge respect to all of them because I could never have done this.😭
Fu calling the cow bad lil girl in the farm had me dying 😂😂😂😂😂
Man respect for George🙌🙌🙌🙌. Man is a top G.
Is it halal
am not gonna lie never laughed so hard in my entire life no cap.
I hate Madam joyce
Fu got me rolling 😂
George was taking it like a champ
This series is gold Joyce and fu screaming in the challenge had me dead😭😭
bring ksi to this eating challenge.. he's winning it all day long
Deeping it I’m coming to day fucking 13 having to endure the same twat of a woman who was supposed to be the first eliminated…
If you got a problem with chicken heart you should probably avoid Brazilian barbecue cause this stuff is always present and it’s 👌 delicious 🤤
Love Joyce but her screaming stresses me out
My mom enjoys eating cow tongue
While I enjoyed it, why wasn't Fu and Joyce penalised for puking? Surely that's cause for elimination, and only George won? Thus, Kaci and Ash get eliminated?  Idk, I feel like while I'm gonna enjoy this finale regardless, if the winner is by vote, then Kaci just wins... Sigh
Fu going on about the cow🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Can’t even lie the cow tongue would’ve been easy for me I eat for breakfast 😭😭😭
“Its COCO PUFFS” bro i cant😂😂
There’s no way I would do the cows tongue
no disrespect to the uk but chicken hearts are tasty are they not
19:33 Fu was killing me 🤣🤣
joyce is far to extra, she needs to tone it down
Fu Izzy is DA GOAT
Fu Izzy is DA GOAT
the one thing i noticed is that each episode there  is different emotions
37:36 is so wholesome from everyone
Maybe it’s only a Canadian thing but anyone around me eats chicken hearts all the time in chicken heart stew and Cow tongue is not out of the ordinary here but I don’t like it
joecy is the most extra person ever like stfu for once in the life shes luck shes got bare back
The food wasn’t that deep
why is george enjoying the food tho
Danny got gyatt
joice is screaming to much man
Fu is the funniest 😂😂
23:35 MEDICATION😂😂😂😂
Loved this series
28:20 Uckers Tounge 😂😂
Nah fu just staring into Danny’s soul had me rolling on the floor😂
Fu izzy is jokes🤣🤣🤣
Bro George is my king. That’s true friendship, doing all that with no complaints knowing it would keep his boy in. Top soldier, reminds me of my best mate, we would die for each other and the crazy part is these two have only known each other for under 2 weeks
7:11 I didn’t think I was gonna make it but were here 😂😂😂😂😂
Mj has some milkers
Imagine Danny’s gf watches this and she sees Danny saying gm darling and picking up ash like she’s his gf she gonna go mad💀
You can see George's discipline! Working hard every single day in the gym pays off, chuck those things down like its nothing! Very proud of you George!
well done Fu for doing the challenge because that looked hard well done mate
GO ON FU!!!!!
I can’t fucking stand Joyce she makes me sooo angry like stfu there doing the same challenge fuckkk
Don’t ever don’t ever speak to kaci like that agin !
joyce is so jarring i cannot stand her
joyce literally only got to the final cause footasylum threw her the biggest lifeline when she got evicted
33:40 Fu was so so traumatized and petrified that he got crickets mixed up with worms and fish mixed up with frog 🤣
Let’s just say that Joyce warned them at the start she was dramatic so they can’t be angry 😂
Danny asked ash the same dwarf question it's okay in fact its cute but people are calling Joyce insensitive and a bully for asking the same??🤣 double standards. love them both, loveee this show excited to see who winsssss!!
not laughed this much from a youtube video omg 😭😭🤣🤣 fu in the challenge was hilariousss
Stop making eye contact with me 😂😂
in lithuania we eat cows tongue, chicken hearts, and i even tried cow brains and its not so bad :D
chicken heart is fucking delicous its a regular grill food
Funlooked utterly traumatised eating the food. Qnd the fact he didn't break eye contact with danny had me wheezing 🤣
Fu i litreally died of laugher 😂😅
Izzy killed me 😂😂😂😂😅😅😅
last
Joyce is real annoying not to be rude but she is just to chatty but at the same time she is my type of bestie she is a real baddie😅❤😊 ash is absolutely aawesome ❤kaci i watch the family channel and urs all u and ur friends are so funny love you❤Danny is so funny i wish i could just meet him irl😊fu izzy always sets the mood he is proballythe best😊George and Danny's friendship is so wholsome George is real good looking not in a love way but he is good at this game!!!!!!! The fact that the hole from danny is still there
Agree w joyce at 14:45 but in this case that doesnt apply to her, because ash is eccentric and stays classy yk
I haven’t laughed since 1869, this shit was sooo funny!!!!!! It took me atleast 3 hrs to watch this episode and the one with MAX in it 😂😂😂😂 honestly black people are just naturally gifted and funny. We make the world go round fr 😅😂😂😂 imagine life with no black ppl. Fu is jokes man why is he doing adlibs to MJ screaming 😭😭😭😭😭😭
Fu is the funniest person he made everything he ate a story line😂
I didn’t even think a chicken had a heart 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 same
MADAM JOYCE IS KILLING ME “ITS COCO POPS!!!” 😂😂😂😂😂
joyce was so good with the food
My favorite episode by far
Fu was absolutely hilarious in this 😂😂😂 I haven't laughed this much in a very long time. What a guy man 💯
Fuuu is the funniest 😂
Fu could have folded but that man did the dirty work!
Here for the Danny Aaron’s masterclass of talking George through it
Fu is actually the goat for firming all that he was funny asf
These man acting like it's a maddens give em kaleji and just tell em it's chicken they'll eat it like nothing
iTs JuSt CoCo PoPs
don’t like the way george was spking to everyone ngl
Never laughed so hard at fu fucking hilarious
no fu Izzy finished me. so funny,
I vomited on my screen😭
no because sugar lips is a menace but they all done so well and always manage to put a smile on my face when I'm sad or not♥
this was scary as watching fui gag /vomit
George should never talk to my Kaci like that again😂
FU WAS KILLING ME 😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😭
Genuinely hate George for some reason. Only cuz he felt intimidated by max wat a pussio
triggered me so hard that joyce was taken the piss out of fu izzy and she acts worse
George really said no reaction 😂
Nah bro fu is funnnnnnny 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Easily the funniest episode in the series
Kaci is the most wholesome person especially Danny giving the vibes
“Why the fu3k isn’t the thing green fam” I love Fu😂😂😂😂😂
Footasylum showing negative comments about Joyce but showing positive ones for everyone else... side eye
Fu izzy deserves to win the whole ting!
nah joyce and fu kills me  joyce: "why is the meal looking at me"  Fu: "that cow was an ukkas before going to the banquet"
Joyce is annoying
Great episode- emetophobia warning ❤
literally cannot stand joyce, oh my days
Fu fighting for his life😭😭😭
Fu vs a raw onion😭😭
Love how George was so chill eating the fish eyes whilst fu and Joyce were screamed 😂😂😂
My favourite episode… Fu is such a guy.. his screams had me dying with laughter bro 🤣
Speed/Kai next season would be 🔥🔥🔥
Surely throwing something back up doesn’t count as eating it?
“I didn’t even think a chicken had a heart”🤯🤯
Crazy how I loved this series but Joyce still being in it has me skipping parts 😭😭😭😭 Stayed for the REST 🔥🔥🔥
Danny out of nowhere: "do you legally identify as a dwarf?"😂😂
This is my first time watching the Locked In series and this season makes me not want to go back and watch the previous seasons bc I don’t want to be disappointed bc I love this season soooo much LOL
Why did george know he had an egg in there 😂😂
Joyce is acc beyond jarring
30:14 this is the funniest clip whole season
george slapped his a*se n then it cracked 😂😂
Ash you can come to South Africa… here you’d be considered normal size
Joyce is so annoying, all the screaming she was doing was her doing way to much, George's poor eardrums
Feel so bad for fu
Joyce had me in tears shouting coco pops when eating the crickets 😭🤣
I was acc gaging when they was eating that cow tongue 😂
I do not rate George at all for telling Kaci to shut up, even just asking her to stop would’ve been nice but to tell her to shut up shows how little respect he has for woman
Omg fu was making me laugh!!!
It’s coco pops🤣🤣🤣🤣
Danny's impression of Fu had me crying 😂 😂
panny parrons is the fucking goat
You guys havent eaten fish head before? With the eye ? E sweet
"That cow couldve gave head to another cow" when they had the cow's tongue had me creaassinnggggg 😂😂😂
Happy Birthday niko and sharky😂😭😂😭
I had to rewind to watch Fu reaction again for the fish eye, I'm in tears over here. Lol😅😂😂😂 he hunch his shoulders up then down then yelled lol😂😂 lawd lol
“It’s coco pops!” 😅 babesss ahhh mate
A woman with a big and confident personality = doing the most. Literally what a joke of a comment
George didn't care about the food. As long as it's to save Danny, he can eat anything for his bro.
George is an absolute mad man the way he juss firmed everything like it was completely normal n he eats it on a regular loooool😂😂😂😂
12:02 singing happy birthday to god knows who 😂😂
fu took this challenge im in tears
I swear kaci deserves this so much ❤
Joyce was so funny in that food challenge 😂
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
Omg fu that is pure dedication so proud
MJ screaming for her life after seeing the meal looking at her🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 lmfao I'm dying love you still😂😂😂😂🤣☺
I would have been screaming like Joyce if I went to pick up the eye and it rolled and looked at me😂😂
kaci bandwagon gaslighting up fu. but George a real one.. that brother bon appétit when it comes to danny 😂💪
‘That cow gave blows to the other cow’ IS MENTALLLLL 😂
How can fu not eat cow tongue coze it's actually so nice if it's cooked
Thank you for censoring the vomit lmao
George and Joyce be so annoying this ep
I see they have censored everyones opinion on M J oy ce you guys are scandalous
Coco pops I’m dead 😂😂😂
Best locked in season
I’ve never laughed so much 😂
Fu didn't eat one bite of that cow tongue😂
I don’t like George and his ego 🤦🏽
Says she doesn't do the most, continues to scream uncontrollably during the challenge.
not the ONLY one that was “eliminated” and then brought back being “fed up”🤡
I love how they’re screaming and George is just chill😭😭🤣😂😂😂😂
fair play to everyone but surly there is a prison sentence for joyce getting to the final like that’s criminal injustice or something
14:33 well said Joyce
George is so rude in this episode
Lost a lot of respect for george when he was telling kaci to shut up
Honestly they make my day I love you all sm and a big weldone
Madam joyce made this video so unenjoyable to watch
Fu is the official locked in godfather
Food challenge is hilarious 😂
honestly i would give anything to be friends with Ash. she is the sweetest person ever
SO PROUD OF JOYCE! SHE CAME TO ENTERTAIN AND WE WERE ENTERTAINED! LET THE HATERS CRY 😂
There is no way I’m missing the next episode
Pretty sure Joyce will just shout random shit just to make sure she's heard 😂
Joyce is crazyyyy want to see more of her in the future on this Chanel!!!
Drogba moving mad

Best season.
Why foes Fu think they had human brain 😭😭😭😭😭 that cant be real

madame Joyce taking piss out of fu then moaning through the whole crickets
Honestly big up kaci for eating this up and leaving no crumbs at all
ASH IS LITERRALY SO MUCH VIBESS LOVE HER SO MUCH LOL 💞💞
They wildn I’m not even eating the onion
Oh so someone told Joyce she’s boring in the night so for more screen time she jumps around and becomes ‘entertaining’. I can’t be bothered
joyce is the most annoying human being on the planet
When Danny says you’re immature you know you have the mental age of an 11 year old and you should know you have something seriously wrong with you 😂😂
Mate George is the goat look how he was smashing through that. He would be amazing in I’m a celeb that’s all I’m saying 🥰😂

george is so brave ❤
i LOVE MJ my queeeeennn!!!!
My screaming after she on the fish eyes part and fu giving random stories in the challenge is just so funny😂
Of course Joyce could eat the food the big fattie
Joyce should of been the first one out ages ago, always screaming for what
joyce is so jokes ahahha she has me creasing every two minutes absolutely rooting for her! x
Honestly I know Danny from Sidemen videos, saw him in a short from the Locked show, never heard of it. Passed two days I’ve caught up to the whole show. It’s really good, like a YouTube BigBrother show… note to bad Danny has a girl cus him and tenn would of been a good on screen couple lol
I love how Danny is so funny he brings live to. The house
I genuinely love this cast so muchhh, the jokes and good vibes, Idk what I’m gonna do after this finishes x
Fu is a G happy for all of them to go to the finals
Ksi doing the challenge : “It’s actually quite nice”
After seeing that food challenge, George is a psychopath. Bro didn't flinch once
Honestly big up everybody in there loving it
respectfully joyce didnt deserve coming back early on, would much rather see ten or star up there in the final fr big ups everyone tho
Why does joyce just shout all the time, acting up.
21:40 it's coco pops 😭😭😭😂😂😂😂😂😂
we all love kaci ❤
I feel like Fu screamed at the fish eyes because Joyce was 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
i never laughed this hard about a yt video y’all are too funny man 😭 best show on yt

kaci is so beautiful and always has a smile on her face. she never does anything wrong and is alway there if you need a shoulder to cry on. :) x
Kaci deserves a win, honestly best person in the house
Fu is honestly an amazing person ❤️❤️
George is so irrelevant for talking to Kaci like that
I have faith in kaci

George needs to stop thinking he’s all that
It’s annoying how George was telling Kaci to shut up like she’s just trying to help
Seriously whoever George's lass is she's luckyyyyy
They need to donate those eggs to South Africa 🇿🇦, those things cost 2mil this side
The way Danny treats the girls is so heartwarming and just remind me there are still good respectful people ❤
Fu and Kaci. The duo we never knew we needed
Mate I love all the people and series
Danny is the best!
FU GAGGING WIDE EYED HAD ME IN TEARSSSSS THE EYE CONTACT😭😭😭😭
Joyce just knows how to bring the joy to the room 🎉 LOVE YOU JOYCE❤ BRING IT HOME❤

George is killing this eating challenge like a champ impressive! i would be like fu izzy throwing up and gagging he did so amazing he managed to eat all without giving up loved it how kaci was trying to change the thoughts of the food and Joyce with those fish eyes you got through it so well! Good luck on finales!! <3
Anyone else think George was rude in that challenge
ash and joyce’s friendship and banter is top tier 🤍
kaci is an angel such a kind soul 🤍
Never seen one comment about Fu, now all the Kaci Stan’s want to ride out for him just because he saved her lol. Kaci should be gone.
Idk why Joyce is acting like the comment doesn’t bother her. Ppl that have to keep saying that, it’s cos I’m they are acc bothered.
Danny is so fake acting like he ain’t said something like “she’s doing the most” about Joyce before to George😂😂. Now he’s acting like the comment is weird. Stand on business.
Danny is the funniest hope he gets the win
I love kaci and the girlsxxx
Honestly so proud of being south African because we eat chicken hearts and cow tongue I would have enjoyed that 😂❤
Best episode yet i was crying when George was eating everything like it was a sweet while fu was up chucking and mj was screaming
Best episode yet everyone copying fu had me weak
Thought george and kaci would be closer but they dont even sit next to each other
Joyce did so well at the eating challenge!!
That was so wholesome to watch them three doing it for their partners. They all did well. But watching Fu, going through what he went through. All for Kaci. Good man. Well done all of you.
37:34 is the cutest thing ever omg
George is avoiding kaci like the plague that hug when they won was so funny it's like he's scared he'd catch covid
“It’s coco pops” 😭 is killing me !!!!
Fu is unreal 😭😭😭 crying, what a boy.

This episode was giving CLIFFHANGER
Cmooooon Daniiiii
Danny for the win my guy
Joyce shouting it’s coco pops is killing me 😂
Fu killed me 😭
Why is George so rude to kaci ? Probably because she rejected him
Watching Fu eat that food had me crying
Joyce did not need to be that extra in the challenge
George got some real attitude, starting to not like him. Man looks 4ft and thinks he’s on top of the world
Oh god i had to turn the sound down on the eating challenge...my stomach was turning...
Joyce is so annoying y she always gotta go above and beyond with everything and she thinks that it’s helping her kmt😑
Joyce pretending she didn’t enjoy the food challenge, yammed every one in 5 seconds. Fou is so funny man
Joyce honestly thinks she’s the main character 🤣🤣
Here from DVG and staying for the vibes 😍 love you all
If this winner isn’t Kaci then you bett I ain’t ever watching Footasylum EVER again
Danny needs win this he’s to funny
JOYCE SAYING ITS COCO POPS HAS ME HOWLING😂😂😂😂
Always knew Madame Joyce is sexy but the show is illuminating sexiness I didn’t see before 🔥
fu almost throwing up was kinda funny, either way he pushed thru and won it for kaci
I LOVE how Joyce's taking it!  That's STRENGTH! GO QUEEN MJ!
You can't tell me you couldn't find a more positive comment for Joyce? SHE'S THE BEST!
Fu didnt eat anything eliminate kacy already
Yoo Kaci Hit me upp after u win, Love
Joyce could do all that, but couldn’t turn down the option of staying in for Watson
when is the final
Don’t care who my partner was they best of accepted they going home cause I wouldn’t of done any of them 😂😂
Joyce making fun of fu and the immediately after doing what he did 100% louder and worse is hilarious lol
Joyce’s comment was not it she is a queen let them hate cha
Kaci has really come out her shell I have watch her for years and it’s so nice to see her confidence just bloom ❤
Joyce eating them fish eyes was the funniest thing bro😂😂
WELL DONE FU.....😊
This is my first time watching locked in. And i love everything about it especially for the house mates . All humble & beautiful personalities 💪🏾 Ten is ma errdy “CRUSHHH” now !!  But I would definitely marry SugarLips😍🔥.
Fu at the end saying had to do it as kaci is his winner 😭
Joyce killedttttttt that challenge 🎉
For everyone 1 person that likes you, there’s 10 that dislike you. Get your facts right madman Joyce
All these kaci fans salty George told her to shut up it wasn’t malicious move on. She hasn’t complained so why are u
kaci is the best.
Fu Staring into Dannys eyes while Tryna swallow the cows tongue has to be the funniest thing this season .
George’s attitude towards kaci was not cute in this
FU ISSY WAS FIGHTING FOR HIS LIFE HAHAHA 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I’ve never laughed so much from this season. MJ and Fu during the challenge were killing me 😭😭😭 I haven’t even finished the episode. Big up all of them
Well done fu big up for being a great team player
GOWAN FU U LEGEND

I’m here for kaci
George is the GOAT
Funniest episode of them all😂😂 killed me😂🎉
Why is Joyce screaming so much like it’s totally unnecessary 😂
This show has actually made me fall in love with Danny… hes so wildly crazy but its so jokes 😂😂😂 i love it
Big up Fu he’s a real one for doing that for Kaci 👏🏾
I love how the ones not eating are like "Aaah it's just crickets" 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Fu is beyond hilarious 😂😂😂 how did he get them to just sing happy birthday to mandem who have different birthdays
im sorry but why was george so nasty to kaci whilst she was just trying to support everyone?
Danny and George podcast, WE NEED IT!!!!
Fu the fuckin goat man he went through his worst nightmare to keep Kaci in hes a real one
Can't lie Joyce is jarring.
Joyce is getting way to much screen time have to skip it everytime. Should of never of came back
Fu is my winner,what a guy 👏🏽👏🏽
George honestly had no right to tell kaci to shut up
Danny hows the caravan
joyce is such a drama queen man wth
George is a gem!
george was being well rude to kaci it seemed this episode
Joyce get more and more annoying every episode 😅
‘ it’s coco pops , it’s coco pops’ had my DYING I love Joyce😭🫶🏼

George firming all that nasty food for Danny just epitomises this whole series, everyone genuinely cares so much for eachother and it’s so nice to see 👏

I would hate to be George in that challenge💀. They were acc doing the most on either side of him😭. He acc looked so jarred loollll
I watch Kaci on YouTube and she’s so doing well hope you winning .
ITS COCO PUPS
The way Joyce is so attached to Ash is so cute! I want a best friend like that
Love that Fu is there for kaci it’s giving big brother vibes
I swear Joyce is just getting on my nerves now I want her gone hope she stops getting immunity
George is a triple OG…Ice cold!
They will be for I'm a celebrity get me out of here
Can Kaci, Ash & Danny all win! The anxiety is real 😂
First time watching this series and i can proudly say that i've loved every episode. You all are killing it.😂❤
Ngl Madam Joyce is Fake.
Before I watched Locked in I didn’t know who George was but he is such a genuine chill guy and Danny we miss Madissons Magic
“Humpty Dumpty yute” 🤣🤣
George is just annoying, getting rude to kaci like that, just not on
kaci, danny and ash must have back ache from carrying the show ❤ xx
am I the only one who didn’t agree with the way george spoke to kaci in the banquet challenge? He was so rude for no reason
Fu doing that for Kaci was the most humble thing got me teary🥹
Everyone who watched the sidemen Sunday a few weeks ago know that fish eyes ain’t it 😂
if Joyce was the one that was on some "Shut Kaci Shut up" y'all would've dragggged her to the mud
Ummm didn't enjoy George telling Kaci to shut up like that..
Honestly love this show season 4 is the best but ash love u girl and love u madam joyce kacey love u Danny and George your funny as and fuzy your just a king but ngl your all winners in my eyes ❤
THE WAY george ate that stuff for danny , hes a real one , fu too
Big Up Joyce she smashed the Banquet challenge
Oiiii FU IS THE BEST 🤣🤣🤣🤣
George needs to be nicer to kaci
Ngl they where eating the food but i was the one vomiting
FOOTASYLUM, GIVE FU IZZY HIS MONEY NOW. HE DESERVES IT MORE THAN EVERYONE. HE IS MY CLEAR WINNER. HOPEFULLY IT GOES HIS WAY.
COME ON KACIIII
Big ups to fu but should’ve just let her go innit. Now Kaci’s going to win the whole thing 💀
Fu and Kaci are like besties super cute 🩷
i cant lie i don’t like the way george kept telling kaci to shut up whenever she tried to encourage them, made me wanna punch him through my phone!? love kaci though such a sweetheart 🫶🏽
FU IZZY GAGGING HAS ME DYING. big up fu for finishing for kaci🫡
Danny's thumbprints looks like mr bean😂😂
Fu killed the food challenge! Him doing that for kaci just shows how big his heart is and how loyal he is 💜
Watched every episode bcos of kaci jay! Proud of you!
Right at the end when fu said no kaci in the final, that’s my winner was so wholesome!
Fu is a puxxy, he almost got Kaci evicted
Can’t wait to no longer see Madam Joyce on my screen anymore so jarring
Fu Izzy is like kaci’s older brother they are the most adorable duo evererrr
FU IZZY EARNED MAJOR RESPECT. You can see he did not wanna be there  for each second.  Stomach it like a real man. Respect
“I’m a real OG bad girl” just shut up bro
Shout out to Danny and George I only knew them in the beginning, but I have no clue if they even knew each other but now they have such a good friendship or relationship
Fish eyes are minor
Why is Joyce screaming like she’s about to get shot mate like calm yourself 😂
Madame joyce has ruined this series
Danny for the win
Ash! Is my favourite and she is so pretty and her funny laugh 😂 obviously❤️💗💕
Help I’m addicted to this show 😅 I need you to bring my girl Ten back because she was the vibe
Danny is the best he just keeps getting better but I’m missing his great RTG content
The girls are so gorgeous, with and without makeup, like models FRR 🤞❤️
So happy everyone has made it through the last day
Respect to Fu he deserves to go final
Keep smiling kaci you’re confident has grown I am a huge fan of you   Kaci for the win xxxx

Fu, George and Joyce firmedddd ittttttt for that challenge
fu that is question for jeffery dahmer

The way everyone looks after Kaci is the cutest!
George standing on business like usual 😂
Real question: why is Danny’s trim lopsided?
l love how Danny is flirting with the girls
you all are so strong and i love how sweet ash is
Fu almost dying next to my man George just eating all the food like hes at some fine dining establishment had me in stitches man, the juxtaposition of the 2 was just perfect LMAO such a banger of a semi final and only right all 6 made it to the finals
18:36 George who tf u saying shut up to
cant wait for joyce to be humbled when she gets out
Yeah Snaking Watson was a good move
i feel like ash would a good mum
danny is the goat
I was crying for this entire episode😭😭😭😭😭this is the funniest shiii I’ve ever seen😭😭😭😭😭Locked In you need your flowers!!!
Bro Joyce shouting at the fish eye, shut uppppp mannn
I hate joyce
Best episode yet fu had me cackling 🤣 and Kaci Danny and Ash in the storage room narrating was hilarious 😂😂😭
George telling Kacei to shut up killed me 😂
Loved George before locked in went right off the boy!
Tbh I love everyone in the house but ash and george are the life of the party ! love you all
Cant believe its almost the last episode soon
nah Fu sscreaming like a bad b had me dead🤣
fu literally ATE! 👏🏽 that was crazy!!
George is actually the GOAT! no complaining, no screaming, just straight up dogged it. Absolute legend and clutched up for my boy Danny. The friendship between the two is top tier ♥
FU IS MY WINNER , if he don’t win I’m pissed
Joyce is so annoying wish she went home first
If kaci goes I can’t watch no more she a 10|10
No way she actually made gender thing
Danny stop disrespecting people to sugar lips 😂
KACI win this for everyone I came in this show for Kaci !! Come on kaciiii !!!!!! X
Kaci owes Fu Novikov I’ll be real
Ash is so funny and sweet - Kaci is like a little sister to everyone and is gorgeous-Joyce brings the happiness to everyone- fu Izzy is so nice to all the other housemates -Danny is just Danny and is hilarious-George is like Danny’s brother and George message from me Joyce is only playing the game she doesn’t “know what she’s doing “ she’s not cheating she’s winning this 💪💪💪   Ps Kaci I hope you win honestly
I came for Kaci and i'm loving joyce so much! <3
Fu is my winner
Ever since the second episode I've skipped any scene with Joyce by herself, or when she is with one one other person. Cant stand her.
Can’t believe this is about to end. I am not ready to say goodbye yet.
Can someone place a mute button on Joyce my god
Joyce just be ruining the full show
I really love Danny's feet and george's meat🤤🤤🤤
Fu had me crying when he said,i didn't even know chicken had a heart 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
i feel like kaci is more close with the boys than the girls. the boys include her more i guess.
Fu needs to win
All the gagging sounded like a horror film🤣🤣🫣
Joyce needs to stop screaming. So jarring.
danny wins or its rigged
I don’t want it to be overrrr
This was by far the FUNNIEST episode😭😭😭😭
“That cow could have gave head to a different cow, that cow gave blows to another cow” -foo. That had me dying!!!
if joyce somehow wins tomorrow 😭
love danny and george but fu izzy deserves to win , what a humble guy
Ash is sooooo gorgeous. I just love her
Lolll Fu was sooooo funny
If any of the 3 win ( Kaci,Danny,Ash) am expecting they share the price with the people who ate such disgusting meals
Il be real George needs to remember his place on my mums life he’s the biggest freshy
Can I bet on her leaving next?
Joyce somehow bear every vote
😂😂😂😂😂😂fu don’t even know what he’s waffling about😂😂😂😂
Everyone supporting Fu in that challenge but Joyce is just screaming and saying shit like "I hope they don't bring out anything moving", have some respect and actually support your housemates for once
Please fu has to win
HUGE RESPECT FOR FU what a legend.
I want Danny to go home but I want a stream
FU’S BUM CRACK LOLL 35:21
DANNY ❤
I hate Joyce so much begs the girl stops screaming
I’m screaming, not Joyce saying the cows tongue needs maggie cubes 🤣😩😩😩💀💀💀💀
Seriously, Joyce and Fu need to visit West Africa for some training about eating 😂. What they ate with the right seasoning, is really delicious
Is it just me or, is Joe being stand off-ish with Kaci because he was interested in her and now he has a girlfriend? But he isn’t like that with any of the other girls just Kaci
I expected this to be light work for mdm joyce in Nigeria Yorubaland this consider a delicacy
fu definitely deserves to win
Ash nyam everything😂😂😂
FU IS A LEGEND for keeping Kaci in
I honestly think Kaci is one of the most beautiful people in looks and personality. Her talent is kindness❤❤
Joyce = give me attention
George. Is. Him. That is all.
Joyce just shut up will ya
i hate joyce shout she is a nice person but i think she over reacts same with fu today big up george
lmao watching Fu dry heave at the cow tongue was comedy, we eat that in tacos all the time 🤣
how can joyce violate fu for gagging then start screaming like that
Fu is honestly the funniest person ever his facial expressions his screams were gold and Joyce eating the fish eyes was hilarious
Joyce needs to be evicted asap jarring asf
“For every 1 person that hates me there’s 10 people who love me” other way around buddy
I dont understand why joyce is so criticised like i think she done sick and added sm to the season
Nah fu izzy just cured my depression ☠️ havent had a belly laugh like this in a hot minute
George. What a fucking tank
So much respect for george man. Absolute legend ❤
Phew! I thought for sure Ash would get immunity and Danny was gone to Kaci. They were showing Danny so much this episode, I thought they were giving him a last hurrah before his departure. Turns out, he is just great entertainment! :D
honestly so proud of Fu for getting through that challenge!!
28:12 “that cow could’ve gave head to another cow”. Fu Izzy kills me bro 😂
Honestly all I want is either fu, kaci or danny to win any of you 3 and we good
Can’t believe it’s the semifinal already. I came for kaci and found my new favourite show!!!!!❤❤
George is the goat 🐐
I don’t won’t it to end 😢😢😢 Kaci is my winner ❤❤❤❤❤
Ash deserves to win. No hidden agendas or playing the game, she’s just there for the experience
Kaci so appreciative of Fu initially knowing he was struggling
Amazing Episode, Fu was hilarious!!!!
George is a fucking legend btw for just acing that challange
tell me why i was eating breakfast while watching the eating challenge 💀😭
one for everybody i think they would all look out for each other in this moment of time i honestly don’t want anyone to go anymore there all so great so gutted last episode soon
Fu had me crying on the floor
Literally had to pause eating my lunch during that challenge 🤢🤢
These are some real genuine people i’m glad we got to see these guys in the house together
At this point kaci could make a ham sandwich and u guys in the comments would make a 3page essay behind that on how shes so talented😂 big her up though but the begging is insane🤣
ash is giving cool aunt of the group  iykyk
Fu and Chunkz singing collab is what we need
This show has made me hate geogre he’s so disrespectful to Kaci it makes me sad for her
Danny has the most dead trim.
Joyce is jarring
Fu gagging the entire time.. I’m literally 💀. Never laughed so hard at a YouTube video 😂😂😂😂😂
BIG UP FU WHAT A GUY LOVELY HUMAN W MAN
The way ash strokes kaci hair whilst she was asleep is so wholesome
ash is such a queen i hope she wins
Danny is de goat 🐐 like messi and ronaldo and Darwin Nunez
Love watching George and Danny friendship on the show beacause it is funny and hilarious to watch as a viewer to watch.
I died when Fu was spitting stories about the cow 😂
Joyce the fat balloon swallowing the food in one go bcuz she’s so used to food
Props to Fu man😭😂😂🤣 He told Kaci he was going to eat everything even if it was sh*t & struggled baaaad🤣
dw tho cuz joyce dont even know her flipping left or rights
This one had my stomach hurting from laughing so hard 😭😭
What is Danny’s hairline😂
MJ MATE STFU WITH YOUR SHOUTING AND SCREAMING JESUS CHRIST
Joyce screaming like that at the fish eye was so jarring.
Danny is the only man I find attractive with a mullet
Fu Izzy is class man😂❤️
I can’t lie Joyce ruins this series
I’ve watched Kaci since day one on dad v girls and it’s so nice seeing her come out her comfort zone!! I’ve never liked Danny Aaron’s on sidemen’s videos but I’m glad to say I’ve seen a different side to him in this house and he is such a lovely guy! Ash fucking kills me the most in this house just like she does on tiktok, she’s so jokes! Fu Izzy, I’d never heard of before locked in but he’s such a genuine guy I hope the best for him and his career. Joyce I’ve found a laugh through the whole series until the last two episodes where I feel she’s bringing the whole house to a low abit but she still gives me jokes and I know it must be hard mentally in there. George again I seen on tiktok and he’s always made me laugh my tits off but I can say I’ve seen a soft side to him in the house and I’m here for it. Never watched locked in before until this one but I’ve ended up watching all other series in between these ones and I can say with chest this is the best season! KEEP THE VIBE UP GUYS YOUR ALL FUCKING SMASHING IT!!!!🩷🩵
Kaci is so positive and supportive! Meanwhile George just being a rude C***
Joyce is the only person that makes me wish my dad pulled out
Fu and danny carried this season
This has been the best episode of the season! Legends, every single one of them 😁
Why’s Joyce been so extra about everything
Kaci is my winner the things she has overcome especially with being the youngest is crazy! Big up to her 🫶
It was George sat eating the fish eyes like they were sweets whilst Joyce is screaming her head off for me😂😂
Why did this episode have a ad pretty much every 5 minutes 🙄🥴
Joyce was so annoying this episode
Honestly they have chose an amazing cast this season overall. I watched this season cause I loved locked in originally and because I was rooting for Danny but I left rooting for everyone honestly especially Joyce I relate to her a lot and absolute queen 👸🏿💅🏾🫶🏾💞
I dont want this season to end! 😢
Fu gave me a headache on how much he is making me laugh
love mandam joyce she’s giving me good vibes love you joyce ❤
Joyce was cracking me up all episode, absolutely love her 😂
Funniest episode. Fu had me in tears 😂
Someone mute Joyce’s mic she’s so jarring
Joyce went through an exorcism in that cricket eating challenge 😭 Lol and the eye round thought she was going to die
I feel like everyone just jumped on the bandwagon of hating Joyce, not me tho!! Love you Joyce, keep doing you🫂💖
Get joyce out if she wins this season was shit either danny or kaci for the win
Fu Izzy is hilarious, GIVE HIM HIS PROPS 🤣
Joyce: "Its coco pops, its coco pops, coco pops coco pops!" Ash: Yep, yep, yep  My fave duo 😂😂😂
Joyce is so underrated i love her shes extra sometimes but its just being herself you dont like it look the other way.❤
Show like these I love and hate at the same time man. You see these people having such an amazing time and finding amazing friends you just wish this could happen to yourself. Big up to everyone I love you all and I don’t even know you. An even bigger up to Kaci because I might have a crush
fast forward whenever Joyce speaks she so jarring
Can’t like Joyce is jarrin
Madam Joyce voice is so jarring
joyce needs to stop yapping and lose already
Fu Izzy you just gotta love him, the way he helped kaci with the challenge. And Joyce jarring as usual.
i'm here for Kaci !! ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Facts that Kaci n Fu should be top 2!!!
Funniest episode this season 😂 I couldn’t stop laughing when Fu was staring at Danny while gagging 😂💀
Loooooool that scream 30:45 from Fu will be iconic 😂😂😂😂
They're all winners in my eyes! What an amazing bunch of people ❤
Honestly, I cried real tears from laughing so much, this episode was hilarious! 😂
Best episode yet! Fu was so funny 🤣 Never knew who Kaci was but she is a real one ☝️ and so beautiful 🔥
Nah Fu Izzy honestly made this episode soooo hilarious!! I laughed so much omggg
Am I the only person who doesnt like george, he seems so shady, always up dannys arse and rude to others
I'm routing for kaci to win come on the DVG fam
joyce is just a pure soul she’s such a mood 😂
Pretty sure footasylum didn't expect all 3 to eat the entire course 😂
I almost threw up seeing them eating this😅😅😅😅
Fu has to win after that. I have never laughed soOOOOOOOooo hard in my life of locked in episodes 😂😂😂😂😭😭😭😭
Fu doing that for kaci is so nice and talking about kaci being his winner ❤
Man said that cow could’ve gave head to another cow😂😂😂😂 funniest guy of all time
Just thought I’d leave a comment and say this season has been dead and I don’t care who wins and I’m not watching this
Wallahi Fu is too funny😭😭😭 bro had me creasing during that whole food challenge omds
hands down greatest season ever i luv you danny what a personality ;)
kaci is a snake shes just in it for the money not for the vibe she said why did you hook me up with him meaning why im a with fu dont rate her no more
22:28 fu Izzy got me so bad, it’s his reaction to the light not going green 😂😂😂
KACI AND DANNYS FRIENDSHIPS IS THE CUTEST HES ALWAYS THERE FOR HER I COULD CRY LOVE EVERYONE IN LOCKED IN ❤
Fu a man of his word
Big ups to George for keeping so calm in that challenge. He fought so hard for his boyfriend
Fu eating the food is the funniest thing I’ve seen in a while. Man said  👀 🤮
no matter who wins we see the growth in kaci this season bought it out Xx
nah fuizzy took one for the team but it was so funny seeing him nearly be sick
How is Joyce in the final she’s more jarring than Tennessee
Love fu izzy man, that guys just brings pure good vibes and make me laugh every time with his jokes 😂😂
This is honestly the funniest episode so far😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
I love that George, fu, and MJ dealt with that to stay together ❤
27:13 TBH this has to be the greatest segment in the whole of LockedIn EVER. Good work Fuu 😂😂😂
i did not know who fu was i gotta admit he made this season his we are here for you ;)
Joyce is so jaring mannnn least rated in the series imo
George at 30:32 saying "is there a bone in it" meanwhile Joyce and Fu are just screaminggg is so funny
Kaci for the win she deserves it ❤
why’s madam joyce the loudest most obnoxious person on earth she’s  screaming like relax yourself your not all that
George’s attitude to Kaci in the challenge was a bit rude 😏
i like joyce i feel like ya'll are just looking for someone to antogonize. everyone this year was really nice, I personally liked everyone.
Can’t lie, a part from Joyce im happy if anyone wins
haha everybody is a winner this season :D i could pay to watch them be locked up forever ;)
joyce is so fkn annoying
Kaci to win🫶🫶🫶
it’s coco pops it’s coco pops
Fu doing that for kaci has be sobbing
cant lie this season has been a w and 🔥
How is it fair joyce use water to swallow half the things? Like even fu cheved
Ash’s face during Fu’s heaving was too funny 😂
THE funniest episode of the series! 🤣
For every one 1 person that hates me there’s 1 person that loves me👀👀👀👀she’s need to stop
The way George’s face changes when he finds out it’s him that’s eating lool
15:08 smelling servere BS 😂😂

Nah fr tho george is a unit he had 0 reaction while eating all that well done
George love for danny runs deep fam, man didnt even flinch at any of these challenges. Mans actually loved up
Nah fu is the funniest person he actually deserves to win this
Bless kaci lol she felt bad for fu izzy and wanted him to eat it so bad cuz she didn’t want to leave every 2 secs she would say thank u,i appreciate it and its not bad but fu izzy was over reacting ngl
Danny acts like a 12 year old smh yall find him funny but I assume it’s because his fans range from 10yr-15yrs
I've never laughed so much in my life than when fu was doing that eating challenging. I was dyingggg 😂😂 he deserves to win after that. So entertaining
As much as Danny is for the boys let's just appreciate that he checks up on the girls every morning. True king.
Joyce is so funny 🤣🤣
lets all be real joyce was over doing it a bit with the screaming
Joyce still jarringggg
Big brother. Do you even lift bro?
George handled the food challenge beyond amazing
I love Fu 🫶🏻 so proud of him.
Fu melted my heart when he said he had to do it for Kaci and she’s his winner.
Just deeped how Danny’s in every thumbnail
Ep13 is by far the best episode! Fu really carried that one on his shoulders, I nearly died laughing 🤣
Joyce is by far my fav this series
Fu’s my winner !
Fu Izzy made me cry with laughter when he gagged while eating the food loooool. And the storylines 🤣

I LOVE MADAM JOYCE AND ASHA RELATIONSHIP SO MUCH BESTIES FR HOPE THEY STAY CLOSE OUTSIDE THE HOUSE
fu is doing everyone so proud
George crushed the eating challenge
On god Madam Joyce is the most annoying person too ever go on this series smh
FU AND ASH ARE MY FAVOURITE TWO
LIKE THIS BUTTON IF YOU LOVE FU
GUYS PLEASE VOTE FOR FU I LOVE HIM
😂😂😂😂img can’t cope w fu in tbd challenge
WHY WAS GEORGE SO RUDE TO KACI IN THIS EPISODE. AND WHY DID HE LOOK LIKE HE DIDNT WANT TO HUG HER AND HE LOOKED TOWARDS THE CAMERA WTF. If anyones watched love island when tyrique told Whitney to shutup he got dragged for it.
MOTM performance from Fu, opposition back line sat deep and was tough to break down but he found space in the pockets, took a couple knocks in the process, eventually splitting the defence to make the difference 😐👈
Fu was like a big brother for Kacy he really struggled to eat but still pushed through just to keep her in
Never have i ever seen someone with such drastic gag reflexes.  Its a good job he aint gay...       Sorry 😂😂😂
I hate Joyce with a passion after the over exaggerated screaming
EVERYONE PLEASE VOTE FU
I LOVE FU SO MUCH HES SO FUNNY AND KIND AND CUTE AND MY WINNER FOR SURE
I love Fu so much he’s my winner. If he doesn’t win I want ash or kaci to win. These three are gold.
I would love if Ash or Fu won it! Ash seems so sick and I love Fu.
That was honestly such a nice thing for Fu to go through all that suffering selflessly, just to ensure Kaci got a spot in the final! Big up!
Id love to see joyce get last
Danny Calling fu and joyce immature for throwing eggs made me die, Does he not remember the orange incident? lol
Todays semi final was soo funny🤣 Everyone impersonating fu was HILARIOUS 😭😭
Joyce so jarring the whole of this season
Not him gagging already over an onion 😅😅😂
I laughed so much my freaking stomach hurts 😂😭
Fu is pure class what a guy man
Omg Joyce is always bringing the vibes I was pissing my pants at her reactions, that would be me asf! Proud of you babes ❤
Where’s the Joyce comments
These man be making it sound like there’s bare exorcisms goin on at once
Joyce. Most unbearable person istg
Not Ash stroking Kaci’s hair🥹🥺
My respect for George Baggs has skyrocketed after this episode. He didn't whine or cry for the entirety of that challenge for Danny's Immunity. What a legend.
As much as Danny has been my favourite housemate fu izzy has had his moments aswell🤣🤣🤣
Is it too late to add a mute button to Madame joyce
Chicken heart is actually amazing! I love it with some spaghetti. And in my country we have a soup called Canja, which is basically a chicken soup, and we put hearts in it too! When I was a child there were “fights” between the cousins to see who would eat the chicken heart since there was only like 1 or two hearts and we all loved them
Why does Joyce keep repeating, if it didn't bang the first time low trying to repeat it
Fu had me crying laughing in this episode 🤣🤣🤣
Honestly Fu Izzy is actually so hilarious idk how I didn’t notice before maybe it’s because less people more screen time but Fu is jokes man
Big ups to everyone for completing the challenge, especially fu, you could just tell he was struggling and still pushed through to get kaci the immunity
Fu looking directly at Danny and GAGGING 😂😂😂
Joyce’s is screaming was heinous
Joyce is so annoying
George is really starting to become cocky and ahead of himself. So rude.
Fu is the realest out here men thuged out everything for kaci
The fact fu could technically be kaci dad BAFFLES me
fu and kaci are my absolute favourites all season ❤ such a sweet duo
Kaci for the win but I love fu soo much for going through and eating all that ❤
Cow tongue is nice if prepared correctly. My man Fu said “Uckers tongue” ya know 😭
Furore the win
Can't stand Joyce, joke how she's in the final
Joyce is such a fake person
Not going to lie that cow tongue look undercooked 😂
We need too see one of the sidemen in this show especially harry- w2s
Nah, they were so dramatic with the challenge. Kaci was fighting for her life trying to convince Fu to keep his head and not yak 😂
Fair play to Joyce
Genuinely happy for any of them to win it but Joyce
Fu like a loving grandad hopefully he wins
Can't stand joyce
I love how u can see how much Joyce grates on fu ,George and Danny
george stood on business today 👏🏾👏🏾
I think Joyce meant for every 1 person that loves you there’s 10 people that hate you
Bro I hate Joyce so much such a beg
can’t lie if fu dont win its a robbery
George getting aired by Danny at 34:25 is jokes😂
Am I the only one who thinks fu Izzy is so adorable ❤
MJ's shaking and George's sides eyes TAKE ME OUT
Fu is soooo funny 😂
George is a real one ffr love him and danny!!!!!!
fu and kaci are the cutest🩷
Joyce is still annoying me af
George bossed through that challenge!!!
Why does Joyce feel so negative. She kills all the fun in anything.
Joyce is the funniest person to ever grace YouTube and that’s on periodT.
34:26 and u see Danny just leave George hanging and George started contemplating his life choices 💀💀😭
You just know from the way Fu did all that challenge for Kaci, when he could have just gave up shows massive signs of how good of a father this guy is. If he can do all that for a housemate, imagine the dad he is to his child.
Love Joyce man she brings so much entertainment
There are 4 possibilities where I'd be happy to see them win which I didn't think before the start of this show
Big up Kaci she’s so amazing I love the way her confidence grew everyday she’s been in locked in
Praying my girl Joyce wins
I want ash💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝
Tell me why I fast forwarded 10 ten times and Joyce was still just repeating the same thing during the eating challenge 😂
Joyce is lucky she’s invulnerable otherwise she’s gone, she’s bare annoying
Fu Izzy was unable to eat the meat because it is not the processed McDonald's meat he has been living on for the last 5 years
Pls get rid of Joyce
37:36 Ash stroking Kaci's face while she naps is so adorable 🥺
Kaci is so sweet deserves the win and well don Fu Izzy for swallowing the Cow tongue
Kaci my fav ever one love u and treating u like it little sister love u guys and the des ve clothes xxxx love u all guys
replace Kaci with Tennessee & that's the ultimate top 6
I honestly love ash and kaci relationship mummy ash so protective and supportive ❤
It’s pretty clear they rigged it for Joyce. She should of been the first to go like she was, they did Watson so dirty. Rigged
fu is soo funny and is soo kind
Danny does look like humpty dumpty 😮
Love how this was light work for George he absolutely smashed the eating challenge 😂
Fu Izzy thugged it out so hard
aw i love kaci and fu's friendship i hope she wins x
Bro Fuu tried so so hard for Kaci he’s actually such a top guy
George and Danny are great but George during the challenge was really being an asshole to fu and kaci
Dont worry guys, we only have to put up with madam Joyce one more episode 👍🏻
i want an ash in my life🥹🥹🥹
Even when kaci sleeps she’s stunning 😂😍
its coco pops
Joyce needs to shut up and leave
Big ups to the bucket. They should win the whole thing for that prefomance 😂
The amount of times I had to pause this video because I was cry laughing 😂
Aint never hated someone as mucha s Joyce icl
Kaci is my winner in my heart ❤
Why was George being so rude to Kaci telling her to shut up?!
I’m so glad no one went home this is the ending I wanted can’t wait to see who wins I think Danny or kaci will win❤
am i the only one laughing at the way kaci says paracetamol
18:46 straight red for George, just flipping rude to the most beautiful girl there no bias in this decision btw
Joyce too fat
Madame Joyce ruining this series with her bellowing the whole time like woman calm down my mums asleep upstairs
Fu is so cute
the fact joyce was screaming during the eating challenge made me watch it on mute. Props to george for sticking quiet rather than making a scene
coco pops is the funniest thing I've heard on this show!!
ASH FOR THE WIN
Joyce is so annoying
Fucking hilarious
Fu the goat fr
i love them all and would be happy if anyone of them wins
i still hate joyce
“That cow gave blows” quote of the series goes to Fu Wiz🤣🤣🤣
Joyce is fucking jarring, she’s always screaming, gets the most screen time and she’s the least funniest. She’s genuinely not the one!
that the only time i've seen Fu be funny
God Joyce is the most irritating and jarring person I’ve ever watched in yt. I literally skip all her store room bits cos why is she always screaming
Stop making the episodes shorter and shorter dangggg
16:06 I just bu-
Joyce the fraud in the final... what a shock
watson 6.4 mil tiktok lukiest human alive no offence hes very funny but there are 100000 more like him so hes not really that unique if you get me
I’m going to miss this season so much, the people in this season formed such a bond and it was so fun to watch. So proud of how far kaci has grown, even if she wins or not she’s my winner
Joyce is just a pick me girl, ahlie
danny miss ur stream ur doing amazing man missing posture though
Really hope fu wins man
George îs a w for danny
Fu had me drying eating 😭
George is so fake every episode
kaci for the winnnnn xx
George firmed everything no issues what a legend
joyce is such a guffy
Fu chatting about the cow giving uckers had me on the floor for a good 5 minutes 😂😂 fair play to the man for making it through for Kaci
I feel like if kaci knew me we would be such good friends she has a similar vibe to me ❤
Please get Joyce out, most jarring person ever
Joyce screaming is the most jarring thing I’ve ever watched
Danny is the house king wahlahi
I’d like to think that the winner is gone be either Danny or the lovely kaci Jay , big up everybody though ‼️🫂
Joyce can’t do anything but make it about herself. Fu is out here gagging and she’s screaming for no reason after she’s finished
Fu is a legend, killed me saying about the coss tounge being an ukkers tounge 😂😂😂 "That cow was a bad b....." 🤣🤣🤣🤣 get this guy on stand up quick time 🤘🏾
Proud of fu man , he’s doing great truly and sending all love to lil sis kaci, It’s amazing how much she’s grown .
Joyce is jarring
Funniest ep
Kaciii to win
Joyce screaming ‘it’s coco pops’ absolutely killed me
Can Fu be my husband ❤
i know kaci wins
ash stroking kaci's hair is actually the cutest thing ive seen all day
Fu had me dying 😂 he needs to win
fu & kaci best duo ever
Fu was vibes , big respect for him and everyone in the house for doing their best .
keep it up, came for danny and love it
George is so mean to kaci for no reason 😂
Y she gotta scream at everything for like stfu should’ve been gone 1st only member I’ve disliked so far
kaci has carries locked in from start to semi-final💖
Get George on im a celeb
why is george being such a dick to kaci? calling her immature and acting like this ….
Fu is one of the most liked but also one of the ones with a smaller prior following. Just shows how much people like him that he’s still in, I’m one of them btw ❤
This was by far the most annoying Joyce has been.
Everyone on this season has been amazing ❤
The only reason Joyce is still here is cause she wins the challenges dk why she's gassing it
Joyce should of been kicked out
Is it too late to ask for a joyce mute button?
Funny episode !!!!
Who could’ve thought that all hell would break loose over a pillow fight?! Not me 😂
Mate props to the guys for eating all that, i struggle with taking my omega 3 fish tablets without wanting to chunder
NAH FU WAS KILLING ME THIS EPISODE 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Kaci is such an independent strong women 💗
Bro chicken hearts tastes so good wth are those reactions 🤣🤣
Joyce shouldn’t be in here it’s a scam Watson deserves it more than her
Big respect to fu honestly doing all that to secure a spot for someone else he’s so class
Joyce annoying me so bad in the challange making me skip it
If Joyce wins my phone is going through the wall
The only bad thing about this season was they got rid of so many people before the finale so for me  it's just getting stale s2 for me is still the best then S4 then S1 then S3
Fu Izzy saying the cow was an uckers 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣he’s too funny
Fu and Kaci>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Joyce trynna say she eccentric instead of admitting she’s the most jarring in there 🤣
Everyone treating Kaci as there younger sister and lets just be real we are all here for Kaci
I’m gonna be honest, would’ve smashed each one of those meals so calm. The worst thing there imo was the onion.
Joyce is fucking jarring in that challenging
Danny looks like chamakh in this episode 👌🤣🤣
I love how ash was there for kaci when ten left love her❤
Kaci for the win ❤
30:14 At this moment Fu realised he was it was over for him 🤣
15:18 deluded boyce
Danny disrespected the whole game
Uno it’s child ish when Danny says inappropriate
Anyone else sense a bit of tension between George & Kaci in the challenge!? & The awkward hug after 😬🤣
kaci is the funniest pereon on this show
fu had me creasing the gagging 🤣
Fu staring into dannys eyes while gagging killed me
she a real og obese girl 1:15
Joyce liked the fish eyes that’s why she strated overreacting
mad respect for fu for pushing through for kaci! KJC for the win!!! <3  Also gotta add, ash is f*****g hilarious!
cows tongue tastes amazing why is that a part of the challenge
fu is the funniest guy 😭
Danny and the egg In his pocket was sooo funny 😂
Icl I love Danny so much he’s acctually so calm compared to his sidemen among us big up ash aswell she is so funny
Joyce is so forward and easy-going, everyone would be lost without Joyce! 💖😘
All of you are trying so hard with these comments just to be in a video 😂 Joyce is honestly the most jarring person I've watched 😂
STOP GIVING JOYCE MAJORITY OF THE AIRTIME... she definitely has a relative in the production team, so unfair on the others
Not watched yet but praying for Joyce eviction 🤞🤞🤞
how George hacked all the foods like it was nothing is crazy fair play🤷🏻‍♂️
joyce is so jarring, every-time i see her come on i skip to the next person
18:35 why is george so rude to kaci'
Joyce Its more like every 10 people who hate u there 1 person that loves u
FU is a fucking warrior man, bro threw up a hundred times while almost crying and just kept on eating! my man!!
Bro joyce is actually so jarring now
Danny Kaci belong
FU HAS TO WIN IT HE’S A REAL ONE
ngl ash fu and joyce are all dead and ruin the show, danny and kaci are carrying hard
I’m so proud of all them especially kacie for clming out her shell but ur all doing amazing 🎉
joyce pipe down so overreactive for no reason
Fu getting them all to sing happy birthday is too funny 😂
what a surprise boyce making it all about her! absolute waste of oxygen!
Stopped watching when Joyce got immunity. She is the most annoying person I’ve ever seen. Ruined the show for me and many. Without her it would be good. Joyce makes me hate this show.
if its not danny then kaci and if joyce win its rigged bro the was the first eliminated and she came back now to the finals
Kaci hugging everyone is so nice but her hugging ash is the best
I love Danny, the funniest guy that ever been on this show!🤣
Has anyone told Danny that there’s a 87 Maddison objective on ea fc
Joyce kinda patterned up this episode still very very jarring tho
Fu is so sweet to Kaci!! Bless his heart he’s an incredible person ❤
Ash is actually an incredible person she seems like the absolute sweetest human being, I feel like you can’t not be friends with her ❤
Fair play to Fu what a trooper. George made it look piss easy and Joyce did well but god bless Georges eardrums.
if Joyce wins I will be fuming come on Danny for the w
Ash for the win 🥇
Honestly Joyce is so annoying she needs to stop screaming ffs
joyce so over the top get a grip your a woman not a 9 year old
Danny is Fr a g Mandems got into watching the girls in the make up room nearly every day and has a gf
Fu talking about the cows tongue and how the cow would have give head to another cow and was a hoe hahahahahahaha
THERE'S ONLY ONE DANNY AARONS!!!
We need all of them at the club by tomorrow, the streets need that pic !!!
I thought kaci was gonna be boring but now she and Danny are my favourite😯
Dani kaci and George are the funniest trio
omgggg george/danny or fuuuu for the win xxx
they really struggling to find something even half nice said about Joyce in the comments hahaha.....
Joyce is so annoying
This has been my favorite episode nonstop laughs but I feel so bad for all of them
Kaci for the win ❤❤❤❤
George was jus munching
i love fu izzy ,kindess man ever>}
I also love that they all made it to the finals after the disgusting challenge. Nobody wants to leave the semis, they don’t want to break friendships
Fu spewing to his right, Joyce screaming to his left. George did so well with his challenge. No complaints, head down, worked hard and got through for his pal. Fair play to the bloke
George is just jarring
George surprisingly done well 😂
Im glad none of them 3 went home thats by far the best outcome😁
This show is elite but some of them are taking the piss by saying wallah like its normal especially ash
funniest episode by far 🤣
30:45 fu with that reaction killed meeee💀💀😂😂
Fu  made me throw up from home , but well done Fu
Joyce is a soldier
When mj asked danny about what has he learned about himself throughout the whole locked in experience he wanted to say he could connect with females so bad
Love how Danny is here for everyone and always listens to the girls and check up on them
Madame Joyce screaming it’s coco pops had me screaming
Fu is literally the best, I love how even though he was literally throwing up every five seconds, he was still eating it all just for kaci true friendship there x
Didnt know who Joyce was before but since the first episode I have loved her!
hard watch for someone who has a fear of sick 🤣🤣
ITS COCO POPS!!! 21:57
Madam joyce should have been the first one out
Madam joyce should go home
Joyce gets wayyy too much screentime, they’re trying to push her down our throats
Joyce just needs to stopppppp
COME ON KACIII
I don’t ever want the show to end
MJ and Fu screaming is the funniest thing I’ve ever seen 😭😭😭
danny please can you come back to the rtg
im sorry joyce but you've gone from favourite to least favourite very fast after your change up
Don't get why the others would give the rest immunity when they're all against each other (especially Fu given him & Kaci aren't super close) 😭😭
Joyce really annoying last episode, she redeemed herself today but still the snaky vibe was still there
25:45 i don't think i've ever laughed this hard in my life 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Anyone but Joyce🤞🏼
Asch and Kaci’s friendship is so cute
Fu is killing me during the rest of the challenge 😂😂😂
Madame Joyce absolutely killed that challenge 👏
Fu is a real one yeah
JOYCE SCREAMING AT FISH EYE HAD ME DYINGGGGGG
"Im gonna eat everything" Hesitates on onion bro
Joyce is so jarring man
bro i have grew abs from laughing at fu eating
Joyce really needs to chill
Fu is too funny
So Joyce gonna try take credit for the pillow fight started by Danny 😂
Fu went out looking for worms for dessert after the challenge
Ash is brilliant class to see her be in final and defo gonna be watching after this but this series has been the best ever ❤
Fu is the funniest guy ever
Ash you are amazing period.
George was cold with it though 😂
George and Danny best duo since ant and dec
can’t wait for joyce to get eliminated tommorow i will celebrate when she fails the first challenge wallahi
starting to see fu's ass crack now lol
Im so proud of Fu for doing all that for kaci and he was so sweet when he was saying "no kaci in the finals, r u mad thats my winner"😊
fuizzy is so good at making people laugh ,if only he was as good as pulling girls 😂
Fu is a gangster and made me crease so hard at the gagging and eye contact LOL
I laughed so hard but I noticed geroge was so rude to kaci like chil bro she didn’t deserve it at all and bless her.her reaction to it is to laugh it out
Fu’s eye contact would send me to paranoia😭
you lot want to hate on Joyce soooo bad, she ain’t done nothing
Danny should be the winner, from day 1 to day 13 he’s been the same (WHICH IS HIS NOT HIS USUAL SELF)
idc who y'all think is jarring or what, EVERY single person in the finale has brought us a lot of entertainment, and that's why they are here!
Fu eye contact with Danny made me laugh 😂
Ash stroking Kaci’s hair is the cutest thing ever!!
joyce trying to firm every comment is annoying like just admit you are jarring and move on bro
For every one person that hates me 10 people love me wtf talk about being full of urself yk
Fu gagging thinking the cow had been ran through was the best part of the whole series 😂😂
Ash or Kaci should win.. Fu coming 3rd 👍🏻
Holy shit this was a dead episode
Wait ash and Joyce are sisters?
Dead episode
Joyce and fu screaming is the funniest thing I’m dead 😂😂😂 best episode of the season
I really think Fu deserves to win 100%
Fui makes me die man 😂😂
We all know Danny’s the goat and he is winning it wit ezz
Danny hurry up and get back to ufc career mode
28:15 that cow coulda gave head to a different cow😭😭😭😭
I’m sure Joyce is a great person but the screamings got to stop, trying way too hard to be the main character
Kaci would be good on I'm a celebrity get me out of here
Ngl, Danny and George are getting a lil irritating.. we get your bros, but getting a bit annoying 🤷🏻‍♂️
Why was George so rude to Kaci this episode 💀
It got leaked Danny won
I hate joice she is so sexist
Having everyone go to the final is the best part. And what Danny learned about himself is so real and it’s what you really win from an experience like that.
Honestly they've all done absolutely amazing. I don't mind who wins at this point 😂🎉🎉
Ash & Joyce are my favourite combo 👯‍♀️❤️ but definitely not watching next year though because it seems like black girls just come on here and get bullied. people saying Joyce is ‘doing the most’ when she’s just being herself it’s actually sad. The amount of bullying and abuse and death threats i’ve seen… I can’t imagine what she’s going to see when she gets out she’s a person too guys - be kind x
Kaci or Danny to win 🤝  Them 2 been carrying the series
Kaci is so sweet
Man like George
George Danny and kaci are the best trio in the house  we all know that’s true  💕💖
Fu with the W , kept his promise to save Kaci and gave us the conent we needed 😅 Nah coz he's reactions were hilarious man!
Can’t stand Joyce at all
was George okay after the food? wasn't in any of the interviews and wasn't seen again in the episode!
george was ruthless, and idk how fu completed it, for someone he doesn't know or will never even say a word to after they leave the house, mad respect I could never do it for a stranger idc
Words can’t describe my hatred for Joyce
“I didn’t even know chickens had a heart”😂😂 come on fu keep it up brother 🐐
ash playing with kaci’s hair is the cutest thing🥹
omg i love MJ 😂
george is starting to become rude and i’m not here for it
Love Danny and George duo, best way to describe it is like a messi Suarez duo. It’s amazing
Kaci is my favourite housemate and I hated seing her upset honestly made me cry xxx good luck Kaci ❤❤❤
I love Kaci such a laugh ❤😂
so sad this ending, kaci has been the nicest person ever and ash is so pretty!!!!
FU IZZY IS MY WINNER FR
16:49 fu trying to pretend like Danny isn’t the focal point of the season 😂
this was the funniest episode til date 🤣
Come on Danny!!!
whys it making me feel sick
george telling kaci to shut up was out of order
All winners in my eyes. Best season so far, no questions asked.
madame joyce is such a bad bleep she eat all them without a fuss
It’s gotta be Danny at this rate
i absoulety love kaci when she told fu izzy to chew chew chew swallow
21:22 Joyce 🤣🤣🤣
fu izzy actually made me crack up when he stared danny in the eyes and just started gagging
It's nice kaci kept helping and trying to get them to think it was something different they was eating well done kaci always supporting your friends and family and other people hun xx
George is such a G man. Kept so calm and compose whilst the others where screaming and yacking
Joyce got cooked with that comment 😂😂😂💀 god wish she’d stfu
15:09 stop the cap🤣
george needs to pipe down with his princess attitude
Someone tell Danny how much spurs are in the mud rn
Fu is the goat for eating all that for kaci 🫵🐐
Fu going through that is one of the funniest things I’ve seen in a long time 😂
I love how Ash takes care of Kaci always making sure she’s ok and giving her hugs when she’s down.❤
Homegirl swallowed that chicken heart whole... No gag reflex... Nice
Come on danny you got this
Fu is so underrated only thing stopping him is he is a  Liverpool fan
Big up fu man’s a tank, respect to him his daughter must be so proud of him
Danny we are all voting for you here in Deutschland
25:46 FU GOT ME CRYING 🤣🤣🤣
Honestly, this show made my anxiety go away! I love Kaci, Fu, George, Danny, Ash, and Joyce <3 You guys are doing so well! I love everyone here <3 God bless you all
Man, honestly, Joyce is always doing the most and not in a good way. Wtf shorties always screaming
Pov: Fu, George and Joyce eating fish eyeballs 🤮😐😱
So sweet of fu keeping his promise to kaci and it wasn't nice of george telling kaci to shut up when she was only trying to help like the rest of them
Ash singing sister sister that’s how Ino she’s a real one💁🏾‍♀️
Omg istg if my boo kaci dunt win im gonna be in tears(i dont mind if its ash or kaci ❤❤❤)
Joyce eating them fish eyes, fam she is doing the most smh 🤦‍♂️
Is it just me or has Danny hair got worse as days go on
Ash and Kaci=best duo! Whe jacket was sleeping and ash was stroking her hair was so cute
I hate how George speaks to Kaci, like shut up u short prince
Joyce is soo annoyingg omd
Joyce Joyce Joyce for the winnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn ❤️❤️
Danny needs to hurry up and get out of this house Icba to be watching drafts anymore on Maddison’s Magic
Am I the only one that’s realised Joyce is thirsty for attention, Fu is generally suffering but she wanted it to seem like her suffering is more important and more attentive?
When ash was stroking kacis hair when she was resting 🥹
them lot smashing it to be fair wish i was locked in - my name isnt even robert
Rooting for Madam Joyce and Ash ! 🫵🏽
Joyce was overreacting
Joyce screaming all the time is so annoying. There is no need at all
Danny and Kaci for the win, the whole series has been supercalifragilisticexpialidocious
It makes a change seeing kaci been treated like a little sister and she has her own special friend with everyone from the lock in how can anyone not like her love her she is so beautiful and inspirational caring inspirational and so funny and a great personality everyone is different so proud of you kaci love you kaci ❤xx
Sugar needs to tell Danny abt the Maddison objective
JOYCE FOR THE WIN!!!!!!
Love all of you ❤❤❤❤
Fu Izzy’s just entered the Locked In Hall of Fame with that performance, unbelievable. 😂
Come back to this comment when Danny wins calling it now
Kaci might win this
hope by the end of this episode joyce is gone
Ash adding bludclart to any sentence is getting so jarring
Joyce did so good😂
Fu calling the cow tongue and uckers got me crying 😂😂
MJ is definition of an animal
did anyone else notice how rude george was to kaci this uou side and look at his face when they hugged
Ngl I want Joyce gone asap
Why does Joyce have to be heard constantly, give it a rest
Yo fu is too funny bro🤣
My favourites are kaci danny and gourge if none of them win i will be 😢😢
Someone pls get Joyce out she doin too much
Joyce was killing me oh my god😭😂😂😂
So glad everyone made it to the finale
Bro fu needs to win this... I love that brother
Fu izzy took me all the way out when he started gagging 😭
I just love how MJ is unapologetically herself 😍chin up girl! You're killing itt🔥
I love how Danny is so nice to all the girls and the boys he’s such a gentlemen
Love kaci she is just slay so pretty big up kaci everyone❤
KACI IS THE BESTTTT
love this fav
cl gorge cooked the whole time he didn’t even put up a fight but big up fu for not giving up
I almost threw up at fus scream
Joyce seems to be the underdog and I don't know why. When she laughs I'm laughing back with her. She is a queen
Danny has that sexy man mullet, it's giving
Ash stroking kacis hair is so cute
Madam Joyce is the best on there ppl just mad cuz their mums back can’t match hers
idc Fu Izzy has to be the winner, especially after all of this. he really deserves the W.
I like the show but the loudness is so unnecessary 😒
fu izzy being a big brother figure to kaci has my heart ❤
33:50 awh the way sugar lips got happy
joyce has 100% ruined the last few episodes for me, constantly just yapping and wanting to be the center of attention
George was so rude to Kaci in the challenge
Fu Izzy killed me this episode, he was staring at Danny and was about to vomit. They were trying so hard not to laugh 😂😂😂😂😂
fu actually killed me this episode I CANTTTT
Joyce saying it’s coco pops has me DYINNN😭😭😭
ash is such a beautiful human being
Mj is golddd
Danny has to win
Omg I’m gonna cry Kaci and fu Izzy’s relationship
Love Joyce!!!!
kaci for the win!
The attention seeking from Joyce is just sad to watch
Met Joyce saying dried crickets was coco pops was so funny.  Edit:Joyce is so ennoying and kept on screaming when everyone else even fu who had just been gagging like mad was sort of chill until fu nearly threw up
Joyce deserves an oscar
Y’all are so wrong for picking that comment to show Joyce! There are people who love her and drop several nice comments buh y’all decided to choose that for her in particular💀
Ngl Joyce needs a fucking mute button 🤫🤐😶
I love Danny’s hair it sexy
i love how everyone lifted ash she’s so adorable, i love her so much. love her and kaci such a duo
I fucking hate Joyce
Best season yet 🎉🎉🎉🤙
Joyce puts on a fake personality for the screen time and is only on to gain fame
Joyce screaming "its coco pops" 😂😂😂
Season 4 never gonna be beaten this was by by far the best lineup all goats
I hope Ash wins, I love her
Madame Joyce trying to make it all about her again, no surprise.
Madem Joyce is the most annoying person in the house without a doubt
I love FU man thats a father right there, he's done his children proud right there
Honestly Joyce is so jarring I really hope she does not win
Fu Izzy is a real star
Thank you footasylum🫶🏽best show on youtube
Joyce has to be the most annoying person on the show
Get joyce off man
George genuinely pisses me off , he thinks he's the shit , bro needs to come down to earth
Joyce is so jarring
Fu is acc hilarious the cow story😭😭😭slut shaming hahahahah
Fu starring at Danny while gagging was the funniest thing ever😂
how do we vote?? i can’t find it on the footasylum app
Fu was a trooper doing that for kaci. Also, there was no need at all for George's attuide towards kaci, just such an unessersary thing to do
Fu did a poo
the fact that fu did everything and ate everything and pushed so hard just for kaci was so sweet saying she’s his winner 😫
Naaaaa Fu has fully sent me WEST with his reaction to the eye ball. I’m 9 months postpartum and just wet myself 🤣🤣🤣🤣🫠🫠🫠
These producers are evil. Every single person got something positive but Joyce. They're not even hiding it. I've said this at least 3 times now.
Kaci desurves to win this for her friends and family
At the end it was so cute ash stroking kaci’s hair I literally obsessed with the girls
Gowan danny
11:38
george standin on business
Fu eating all that for Kaci just shows how good of a dad he is <3
Shut up Kaci!!! No! George you where definitely in the wrong
Ash stroking kaci's hair is gold she has such a big heart x
george is willing to die for danny thats the best friendship ive ever seen
Good luck everyone keep it up love you all 🎉🎉🎉 my fav so far is kaci and ash
Fu literally doing that for kaci they have the most underrated friendship
joyce eating that fish eye was actually the worst thing to watch felt like ripping my ears off
I really liked that footasylum did a challenge instead of a least popularity eviction. I hope the finals is the same. I think it would be nice for the houseguests to fight for the crown instead of a vote deciding the winner
Sorry but I was dying laughing when fu was eating the foods
Fu is the funniest person ever HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHA
Why is “Joyce” whoever she is, still there?
10:10
So glad they all went to the final because I couldn’t watch the final without one of them three
Love MJ too much her personality makes up the whole house
I love kaci she’s my favourite in this show it’s amazing how much she has come out her she’ll xx
Joyce screams for attention
Love kaci she’s just a hand full of joy ❤
Fu is killing me genuinely one of the most funniest people to go on the show😭😭
George is a real one tho 👏 took the challenge like a king
Big up for fu for doing it for Kaci💯 been the best nearly 14 days YouTube series I’ve watched🩵 KACI FOR THE WIN💎💎🩷
Danny is the goat 🐐.Rooting for him since day 1
I can’t lie Joyce need to be quite, ruining the show atp
7:37
w series
Does Joyce ever actually shutup
Ash is the best person ever her energy is brilliant and she’s so funny
Kaci was so sweet to try and keep the spirits up for fu.Well done fu there’s no way I could of even done the onion
Joyce is so jarring man
George would be golden on I’m a celeb ya know. He smashed that challenge tbf big up man 💙
As much as i love the girls and everyone in the house, one of the boys has to win it for me because the banter is just unreal
DANNY I WANT A NONE DRAFT VID ON THE RTG
George wins it for me
We love kaci-j xx
25:43 😂😂😂😂😂
lol danny can kick a puppy and be loved 😂😂
One thing I’m gutted about is I haven’t been able to vote on the app the whole season. The app seemed bugged also if it’s based on fan bases then the winner will defo be Danny or Kaci which unfair for the people with the smaller fan bases.  Honestly Fu Izzy deserves it as he has a smaller platform and has proved himself in every challenge.
Fu for kaci wow that's freindship
Fuu killed me 😂😂😂
If madame joyce wins this….
Ain’t no way Joyce survived another day. Get her out asap
We love all of them but gorge is so funny wanna let him win 😂😂😂
28:12😂😂
I was worried for kaci when ten left but fu and kaci are the best duo I live for them two xx
IT’S COCO POPS !!!!!!!
@Footasylumofficial Danny for the win
I love u lot ngl im kinda sad its ending but anways big up all yous
you can tell george’s girlfriend said he can’t be too friendly to kaci (they had history before the show) bc he fully hugged everyone so tight, PICKED ash up & then only put one arm around kaci hardly hugged her 😂 it screams insecure
Why is George so rude to kaci?
kaci is actually unreal
Absouloutly love Joyce's energy and just her in general
Fu Izzy this episode had me laughing sm😂😂😂
.@  .
..
Fam fu izzy said I didn’t even thing chicken’s have hearts😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
These competitors could have said NOPE not eating that and eliminated there competitors but they sucked it up to save them. That's the spirit of season 4 pure CLASS. I'm in love with thus series
I actually wouldn't mind who wins cause I like everyone here
The girls song Fu, George and Danny were singing was 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥 they gotta do a remix 💯💯💯💯
Fu staring into Danny's soul as he gags killed me 😂😂 Should not have eaten dinner whilst watching the semis 😂
love fu and kaci such an underrated duo 💕
Fu izzy face had me cracking up 25:34
Guys I won’t lie they weren’t coco pops😂😂😂
What a series with different personalities man  Fu I actually like way more than I would have thought proper real genuine fella proper Dad vibes supporting Kaci!
after seeing the sidemen spill your guts or fill your guts the fish eye was surprising to see🤣
God knows I’m crying😭😭Fu is hilarious 😭😭
Kaci, Fu or Ash needs to win for me
Kaci
Who else is going to miss this loads  ⬇️
dannys acc class. need to have a night out with him. hit me up danny if ur down hahaha
Humpty Dumpty Ute 😅
The eating challenge was absolute gold 😂 well done fu 😂
How have we allowed Joyce to make it too the final ? Genuinely? We failed as a community
No disrespect to Joyce but the producers should’ve kept her out of the house, last season they brought back Grace because she was entertaining and funny and got along with everyone, this season they tried the same with Joyce and it hasn’t worked well at all
33:37
I’m so happy Joyce suffered I hate her so much she is the most jarring person I have seen online
Saying it now the winner is either ash or fu izzy😊
Idk how yall hate Joyce so much. She doesn’t even do too much. If she laughs…annoying if she voices her opinion…annoying. Go face your life
i love ash and kaci x
Fu MVP performance
Madame Joyce is JARRING.
danny to win this❤❤
KACI FOR THE WIN
I love cow toung
DaS mY gUyeeeeeeeeeeee
Loving Joyce! you are "Medicaation" for the soul 😂😂❣️
The way joyce was screaming throughout the episode made me want to stop watching, she is so jarring man
fu was hilarious on this one 😂😂 the eye contact LMAO
Fu is the supportive big brother we all need
chicken hearts are a delicacy in brazil, there my fave 🥰 cant believe they didn’t like them
" your not disabled you're just small" this had me laughing so much 🤣
Fu does not know about Danny’s YouTube channels
“Hey queens” 🥹🥹🥹 … “how’s the girlys” his the best
The way Ash would look away when fu was being sick and then Ash would look back at fu just to laugh at him staring into Danny's soul 😂
There was no need for George to speak to kacey like that so rude
Danny don’t get enough credit man big up him ❤
Danny has the best mullet ever
died of laughter CRYING SCREAMIMG OF LAUGHTER! fu izzy got my respect ❤
Fu is a true man doing that for Kaci, my goat!
Fu fighting that much for Kaci was so fucking class I swear
This friendship with danny and kaci is underrated 😮❤
I swear to god fu and joyce need to know it’s ASK not aks??
Ash stroking Kaci hair so sleep has me 😢
i really want ash to know, i love her so much, she’s so cute, and her laugh is contagious, plus the way she puts things about her height makes me feel less insecure and more confident about myself because i’m tiny 😂
Joyce screaming was so fucking annoying
I just love how fu is just so wholesom like how he said Kaci is his winner just the cutest thing ever give the guy a big hug ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Big ups for George Joyce fu Izzy on the that challenge the are the ones the legends the goats they have heart fu treated Kacy like a lil sis on death row gorege just had his boys back made sure he stayed and lived Joyce took Kate of her sis and made sure she made it
No Joyce, for 1 people that loves you there are a hundred that hate you...
We need Niko in here
No lies bro but Joyce is always rude to Kaci not gonna lie and Kaci is always tryna be nice but Joyce be like 'shut up kaci'
Joyce looks homeless
joyce is the most jarring person in the world shes doing to much
GIRLSSSSSS
Fu is the goat
Shut up Joyce
Danny’s humour is golden 😂❤ rly hope he wins ❤
Ash just playing with Kaci hair is so cute shows she’s just so motherly and kind ❤
Why they tryna fat Joyce up or summit
Love kaci she’s just a hand full of joy ❤
love George but why’s he telling kaci to shutup like that
lmk why George was eating like it was a meal from a Gordon Ramsey restaurant 😂
Love kaci she’s just a hang full of how and is like everyone’s little sister ❤
LOOOOOOOOOOL FU KILLED MEEEEEE
This genuinely has to be one of the best episodes of locked in in any season. I died throughout the whole challenge
How do I vote man
Danny constantly reminding everyone that one of them would be leaving was funny as hell😂
Joyce is the most jarring person in all the locked in series (2nd only to Max K)
Kaci should win man love all of em but kaci deserves it so much not as much as any1 else necessarily but it would be so sick for her
Good, can we all agree to get Joyce out the house as soon as possible
these guys are missing OG fortnite. bless them lol
What fu went through for kaci is just special.everyone one in locked in deserves a win for going through all of this I couldn’t just possibly couldn’t well don’t guys also love kaci she’s just a hand full of joy she’s like everyone’s little sister ❤❤
I love how at the start they were sort of awkward but now they are all so close and like family to each other ❤🫶🏼❤
Nah I love fu
bro joyce does way too much fem like way too much especially when eating the fish eyes like abeg stfu
they way george is just chillin with fish eyes and joyce is getting possessed
First Star’s Crack now Fu’s crack 😂😂Clearly having a cracking time
If Joyce wins not watching it Ney more can’t lie
What fu went through for kaci is just special.everyone one in locked in deserves a win for going through all of this I couldn’t just possibly could well don’t guys also love kaci she’s just a hand full of joy she’s like everyone’s little sister ❤❤
I love you joyceeee
Can't lie as long as Joyce doesn't win I'm happy
I’m sorry but fu throwing up is the funniest thing ever but still love this show dk what I’m gonna watch after tomorrow
ITS COCO POPPPPSSS!!!!! Haha
40 min episode is outrageous  kacis still lengers
fu is the most kindest caring person ever 😭😭😭crying he’s so wholesome
This show is so iconic 🔥🔥🔥
George is so awkward around Kaci 🫠
Joyce was like 90% of this episode. George barely had anything bro
Madam joyce saying they put maggie cube on cow's tongue sent me😂😂😂😂😂😂
Fu's reaction to the fish eyes 😂😂
The finalists have been my favourite from the get go minus Joyce of corse 😂
I love Ash, madame Joyce and kaci they are all lit the sweetest cutest caring people !!!!
it's a hard call who I want to win but I think it's Kaci or Danny Aarons i love watching there YouTube videos love from Scotland
All off these people are amazing ceap  up the good work and Danny love u brother
Kaci is so funny they are all smashing it!!!
Never commented on a video in my life but needed to say Joyce is the most annoying person I’ve ever seen in my life no clue how she’s got this far
Footasylum is deleting all posts of people venting about Joyce and her antics! What a shame!!!!
ive been saying it from day 1 wallahi Joyce should be gone
Please DONT let Joyce win and I’ll buy all the footasylum merch I can afford
although danny never had to come out of his shell (cos hes insane) he helped everyone else be themselves with his energy
George is soooo good. No noises, just amazing
“ITS COCO POPS👹”
defo kaci & fu for the win!!
Why did George look at the camera like that when kaci hugged him yet ran straight over to ash after with good energy after hmm😅 Didn’t like that vibe at all….
we love fui doing that for kaci hes the kindest person i swear
Joyce making the final is a robbery, never watched a more annoying person in my life
Bro i dont understand, i would get so annoyed with joyce
All of them deserve to win, such a good cast. but fu threw up his insides to support kaci. That’s a winner 🏅 right there
The way Joyce through the pillow straight at Kaci 🤨🤨🤨
George is too good no reaction from fish eyes. My goat
FU izzy is always looking fresh
Why is joyce acting like she didn’t enjoy every munch😂
ngl Joyce isn't my fav but is still class and overhated
Joyce: I definitely did not think I would make it to the final. 36:53  That makes two of us.
Fu screaming cause Joyce was screaming might be a top 5 moment in this season
got so many winners in this series ash fu and george top 3 😍
Kaci is giving and whith the des veu  tracksuit is giving love u kaci
ABSOLUTELY FUCKING CREASING AT FU
I don't like the way people keep coming for joyce. It's so unnecessary. Joyce is a vibe.  Rooting for you sis x
joyce should of cleaned up herself
Fu is the sweetest love his and kaci’s friendship x
🎶 there's only one Danny Aaron's 🎶  and that Danny Aaron's a legend favourite on the show
Fu is the sweetest love his and kaci’s friendship x
I love the Kaci and the Ash duo ❤❤
Fu and Joyce were freaking out on everything while George was chilling eating it all like it’s his fav food
Thanks god YouTube has fast forward for every time Joyce is talking. ZZzzzzzz
Kaci and ash are so iconic love them x
We need anyone but Joyce to win for this to be a 10/10 series
Joyce is a absolute melt holy fuck
Man I’m so happy that they all got to stay. I still miss the other four though
If Joyce wins this then we know it’s set up. She is so annoying.
Joyce is such a drag dude wish they kept her out when she was rightfully eliminated
There's only one Danny Aarons😌😌😌😌😌
Fu just made that the funniest episode ever. thats my winner.
Ì love  Kacy  and Danny
39mins long??? wtf why are these episodes so short it’s the semi final
fu’s story behind every meal😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Love how Joyce was the first person to leave and now she is in the finals
Madam Joyce yelling about the bugs she ate being cocoa puffs is literally sending me! Haha
Madame Joyce eating the fish eye was giving slay
Fu izzy is the goat 😂😂
This is the funniest thing I’ve ever seen I’m dead
kaci, fu and ash are my favs because over the whole series they have just shown so much kindness and joy to the whole thing so has the others but like yk they are the main ones xx
HAHAHAHA IM CRYING
Fu is the funniest person on this show ever what he said about the cow is the funniest thing ever
This is an elite group of people ❤🤞🏻.
I skip over all of Joyce's screen time, she's a shambles
I love Fu Izzy so much❤️ He deserves everything and I need him to win
Danny or George to won it
Kaci will always be a winner to me, big up her for doin so well even when being the youngest in there ❤
Oh I love how ash is with Kaci! It’s so sweet  And fu and kacis friendship is so cute !!!!!!! ❤
I honestly cant be arsed with joyce imo shannon was better but all u chrismd fans are gonna slay me lol
fu izzy is a legend
ash honestly brings the vibes!! shes so quick witted too!
George don’t speak to Kaci like that again
Ash, fu and kaci are just amazing ❤
Joyce can’t say anything without “Like”. 🤣
You don’t eat the cow skin tongue frff to tacos de lengau
FU AND JOYCE ARE HANDS DOWN THE FUNNIEST PPL IN THERE I WAS CRYINGGGG FAM
joyce is so jarring
Ngl, the raw onion was the most chill thing to eat😂😂😂😂 I love onions. The fish eyes ain't bad either. I've eaten them growing up. I'm surprised Joyce couldn't handle them 😂😂
DANNY NEEDS TO WIN🏆
Why is Joyce always screaming
Don’t want this to end!!
Came for Danny now I need to see my boy win 🙌
ngl this season seems rigged for the girls
I swear down if madam Joyce wins this and not one of danny fu or kaci it’s a complete fix
funniest episode😂😂😂😂
Fu and Kaci are the sweetest! Love them both ❤
Big up kaciiiiiiii
36:53 "I DIDN'T THINK I WOULD BE IN THE FINAL" but smacked people with her bottoms to win musical chair and almost cried when she didn't win pass the parcel
I have tried to like danny but i just can't i don't know why🤷🏾‍♀️
GEORGE IS A HOMIE !!!!
george kaci or danny deserve the W in my opinion
Couldn’t stop laughing at Fu 🤣😭 Mad respect for doing it all for Kaci, What a legend 🙌🏼
ash mothering kaci on the sofa is beautiful.
Felt so bad for Joyce with the comments for each competitor 😢😢
omg why was i vomiting for them
Absolutely nobody... Fu izzy:👁👅👁
Thank you for the entertainment guy love all of you and happy birthday niko🎉
i love that kaci is like everyone’s little sister in here it’s so sweet and such a contrast for her being the oldest sister at home❤
Joyces ‘medication’ comment really got me 😭 I must be the only one who rates her 😅 this ep had me SCREAMING with laughter
not fu izzy giving the animals backstories😂😂😂
Honestly all can win except Joyce tbh
Sigma George my guy
Mj is sooo jarring like it’s unreal honestly, should of never been brought back in, skip all her moments when I’m the store room
ash stroking kaci’s head while she was asleep was the cutest ❤
Get Joyce out she’s ruined the series
What fu izzy did was actually so freaking nice, like he ate all of that even tho he hated it
Fu Izzy talking to himself is SO CUTE lol
Who went this episode
Fu Danny and George is like MSN it's 🐐🐐🐐
joyce is acc so jaring
fu and kaci’s new friendship is unmatched, it’s the sweetest pairing of the oldest and youngest people in the house❤
ayyy i would marry Ashh on the spot
Fu is too funny
Joyce is so jarring man how has she made it to the final that whole vid she was just screaming
How you gonna make ep 13 only 39mins wtf
Joyce’s voice goes straight through me at this point she’s so jarring for everyone that hates 10 people love me keep dreaming girl honestly so so annoying
Just to make sure. Is it skiddy ten or fu
I FEEL SO BAD FOR FU BUT IT WAS SOOOOO FUNNY HOPE YOUR OK FUUUU
fu is such a legend. a real one right there!!!
Danny boi is already our winner 💪🏻 com’on g
KACI FOR THE WIN!!🫶🏼🫶🏼
Ash is like the big sister everyone needed in this house she’s really held everyone together
George 🥶
Joyce in the eating challenge really sounding like Max Khadar💀
fuizzy a somali man and struggling to eat those food is so dissapointing
Madam Joyce carrying as she should. 🐐
fu is so wholesome! the way he went all the way for kaci is wholesome! as fu says "kacis my winner" but fu ur also my winner!!
everytime kacey speaks i lose a braincell
Ash and kaci’s friendship is so underrated ❤❤ ash and kaci are fr like long lost sisters♥️ the way she was stroking kaci's head when she was sleeping just melts my heart ☺️☺️
I hope fu wins as much as I love every contestant fu tried so hard for kacy he has to win for that love u kacy,ash,fu,Danny and mj ❤️❤️❤️best season
Ngl Fu didn't eat the cow tongue he chewed it and then spat some out in the bucket or threw it up kinda unfair for the others
Fu is hilarious 💀💀💀
Absolutely awesome and ash is soo beautiful and her makeup is flawless make sure she hasn’t snuck an artist in her bag 😂😅❤❤❤❤xxx
Is it just me or George looks like enzo Fernandez without the jewellery
Ash stroking Kaci’s head whilst she’s sleeping is so cute! Big sister vibes ❤
George is pissing me off. He's being so rude lately for no reason. Kaci was simply trying to encourage them and he kept shuting her down by telling her to shut up. It was so rude and unnecessary.
kaci an danny look good together
Everyone treating kaci like a little sister is the cutest like the way fu looked out for her and ash was stroking her hair is so heart warming especially when she’s the youngest there
I can't lie i am obsessed with Mj and Ash's friendship,it is so beautiful! :)
big up joyce
Kaci is the only reason most of us are watching ❤ we LOVE HER
Noo stopp im actually gonna cry why do evictions even exist their all amazing and gorgeous in their own way.Good luck to them all and may the best one win.
Danny always knows how to make me laugh 🫶🏻
Why is Joyce always trying to be the centre of attention, like let someone else have the spotlight for once.
ibr after watching this fu deserves to win the whole thing that guy was dying inside😭
Kaci + Fu 🔛🔝
Kaci is so sweet, she’s the bestie everyone needs ❤
Nah Joyce needs to leave asap
Fu gagging whilst he stares into Danny's soul is actually killing me 🤣😭
George and Danny fav ship
Hate how they always showing those shady ass comments about Joyce when it's ppl showing mad love for her & rooting for her😑
Big up George. Zero complaints, ate all of it just to keep his boy in
respect fu so much he thriws up and just keeps going for kaci
fu is a legend
If Fu or Ash win it, i'll be satisfied.
Think some would call this a dead season but its my favourite so far. Casting was different, everyone seem so kind and empathetic sounds boring but great job. Next season will likely be purposely more eventful
Fu is such a trooper for that 👏🏼 & George smashed that food challenge 🎉
How Joyce has survived is beyond me. Footasylum listen to the public and actually eliminate her.
Joyce has to be the centre of attention at every occasion, never shuts up man
Joyce has to be the most fucking annoying person to ever grace a phone screen. Screams constantly trying to make everything about her when literally no one in there bar ash even likes her
I feel sorry for fu izzy 😂😂looks mad funny
Fu is slowly becoming my favourite in the house😅
Honestly this episode of locked in has been incredible. Everyone has come so close it’s sad to know it coming to an end but well done to them all. ❤
ASH!!! ASH!!! ASH!!! I NEED YOU IN MY LIFE AS MY WIFE. I WANNA BE LOCKED IN WITH YOU UNTIL THE DAY I DIE!!! Coming to the UK just for you all the way from Canada ❤❤❤😂😊😊😊
Fu is so sweet for that though just for Kaci because clearly that's not easy for him.
That was honestly so sweet that Fu did all of that for kaci and if it wa someone else he wouldn't of made it that far really shows the father figure he has ❤❤
KACI FOR THE WINNNNNN🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Locked In S4 has been the most entertaining thing on the internet the pass couple weeks, everyone's smashing it! Will definitely be watching S5!
Fu Izzy trolling them with the birthdays is too funny😂
I feel like if  George win  then Danny  win
Fu saying he didn’t think chickens had a heart is so funny😂😂
After seeing Fuizzy throw up just to save Kaci,  u can really see how much u love and care for each ❤❤
nah this ep is my fav
Do you think it's Coco Pops Joyce?
you lot make me so happy man all u deserve the best icl 😂
FU IZZY is like a cute little teddy bear and he’s like a dad to all the house mates, a true winner
George absolutely smashed it
Come on danny, so many people rooting for you! Spurs have lost 2 games while u have been in there btw:)
I’m dying at Danny Russian accent 😂
Joyce telling about fu for gagging for food, for her to scream like she was shot in the leg when she grabbed the fish eye.
ASH KEEP CARRYING THE SHOW ON YOUR BACK LUV ❤
this is 10000% the funniest episode so far LOOOOOL
"Shake that ass for Drake" lmfaaoooo
Danny definitely needed this experience
Nah fu 🫡 because he’s threw up for kaci for her to win in the final I need fu to win now😅
38:56 THATS OUR WINNNNEERRRRRRR
Kaci is so sweet, been watching her channel for ages now! hope she wins!!
I’m sorry Ash stroking Kaci’s hair whilst she slept… 🥹🥹
Naaah danny was lying to joyce he learned that he can actually talk to women 😂😂
Episode 13 belongs to Fu, idc lmao. When I tell you the episode was 40 minutes long but it took me an hr and a half because I kept pausing to catch my breath? Hilariousss lmaoo
George is a g he didn't even gag once❤😂
get fu on im a celeb🤣
Love the bond everyone has, kaci to win xx
tell joyce to shush
KACI
so joyce made all that boys vs girls thing and for everyone to hate her last episode to no one getting elimanated
Fu Izzy is the goat he needs to win this 😔👈👈👈
Fu talking to Danny about followers when I’d say Danny has the most consistent followers out of anyone in the house aside from kaci, every account Danny has on a social platform is solid, not sure what Instagram and Twitter are saying but he’s around a mil in pretty much everything else, not sure on twitch either.
Fu was hilarious 😂😂
That’s a father’s commitment from fu tbf. Rate that he did all that to save kaci from being on the chopping block 😂
Boring that nobody was eliminated.
30:42
kaci and ash🔛🔝 they are the cutest duo!!!
Joyce expired after ep 5 honestly
Joyce has got to go
Fu staring into Danny's soul had me dying.
george must of been hungry in the eating challenge, didnt say a word
cows tongue slaps idk wtf they on about, i woulda asked for seconds tbh
I can’t even with Joyce
Fu you killed me LMAO
Madam Joyce has GYAAAT
Joyce is a bit to much
37:34 stop it ash is so sweet to kac
Fu & Joyce screaming over the fish eyes had me tearing up 😂😂😂
"It's Coco Pops" 😂😂
I love the girls song for when they where going to read the comments 😂
I love Ash she’s actually an inspiration her personality is so pure and clean hearted
Fu spat out most of that cow tongue.
Fu and kaci are my favourite duo this whole series!! Fu had me cracking up this episode along with kaci reactions 😂! Rooting for them both
Danny needs to brush his hair down it’s all standing up at the back
The way each & everyone of these have looked after Kaci is emosh !
Anyone see how Ash had the likklest g string when she hugged George👀
Love Kaci from day one and forever.Her personality is so funny 🎉😊
21:23 MJ telling herself that the crickets were coco pops took me out 😂
Even though Joyce was screaming through it 😭😭😭 she backed it quickly every single time 👏👏👏
What is George’s problem with Kaci. Telling her to shut up?
26:15 proof that Joyce can laugh without making noise!
The funniest ep yet!! Joyce & fu screaming had me crying 😭😭😭
What is George’s problem with Kaci. Telling her to shut up?
I know I am a boy but, Danny is awesome and handsome, I only knew him at the start, he never makes me not laugh
Ash making me fall for her each episode 😭😭😭 Danny my GOAT 🐐 HOLD THAT TOTSPURS L G
34:52 AWH kaci is lil sis fr
Joyce eccentric and funny???😂eccentric in a werid ass way then sure but defo not in a good way and defo not that funny either haha. Crazy how she made it about gender and then wouldnt be surprised if the race card got added there aswell when it has nothing to do with. Ash on the other hand actually is funny and you can say the gender and race there aswell but like i said its got nothing to do with that and more to do with the personality and attitude of the person.
ash is my fav person ever. like actually
madame joyce is the most jarring out of all locked in seasons
Nahhh fu izzy telling a stoyline of every thing he eat is sooo funny
gloria from madagascar is prime example of what happens when u tell fat people slay girll
Everyones slaying.
33:32 lots n lots of pleasure Fuuu 😂😂😂😂
Nah cuz Ash would genuinely be the best mother ever much love to her she’s the nicest
i feel like danny has it in him to win the whole thing... 10k on fifa points here we go
i love ash so much. she’s so selfless and the way she was stroking kacis head was so cute bcuz she knows she’s missing ten. their bond is too good mannn😭😭
Ash for the win, what a sweetheart🫶🏾
The girls are smashin it 🤍🤍
I can not wait until tomorrow ep ugh why 7pm
34:08 SHUT UP I LOVE KAC AND ASH SO SOOOO MUCH
Why does mj always do that fake croaky laugh I don’t get it
Dumb challenge danny should be out by now
34:03 kac and danny >
Omg Danny is halerious big up for Danny 👏👏
34:00 kac is such a qt she was so happy awhhh
George is a true only man
kaci i believe that u can win ! love u
fu is the cutest ever . like hes such a lovely down to earth man , hes so funny too .
this has to be the best episode so far considering almost half the group are gone
The seasons of Locked in just keeps getting better and better, I loved the season so much so chill when everyone gets along.
George is a G
FU IS TOOO FUNNY!!!
Fu Izzy gagging has got to be the top 3 highlights of the series 💀💀💀
I like Kaci outfits and Kaci done so well
George telling kaci to shutup when she was trying to help them n then being rude to fu his attitude this ep was not it
Locked in is keeping me sane right now I can't lie. Love Danny and kaci
Kaci I’m so so proud of u, I have been hoping for u to get through to the final. U go girl and always rocking the des vu!! x 💞
Joyce really does my head in.
“what pleasure?” - Fu 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I love ash and kacis relationship it’s so cute 😫so wholesome 🥰
SOOOO both immunity challenges today and yday were fully pointless HAHA
SOOOO both immunity challenges today and yday were fully pointless HAHAH
SOOOOOOO both immunity challenges today and yday were fully pointless HAHAH
I like kaci
ash is so loving, that stroke on the head sent me. that's a mother right there
Honestly fu is fricken amazing!! So much love for him.. and Kaci sleeping on the couch and ash just rubbing her head at the end is so cute stop
im sorry but Fu staring into Danny’s eyes while gagging is the funniest thing ever
Danny and geroges friendship is one in a million. They've only known eachother 2 weeks and they are inseparable. Love you guys ❤
Dont like the way George was speaking to Kaci n Fu during the challenge.. felt like his mask slipped a bit👀
YO FOOTASYLUM, ITS TIME TO BRING FOLABI(KSI) TO THE FINALS OR STEPHEN TRIES TO BRING UP THE HEAT
george might be gay the way he was backing that food you would have thought that was his man
Locked in very good series
Absolutely amazing episode, even though Fu was dying. Can't wait for the final.
Glad this season is just about over tbh, Joyce makes it unbearable.
i love every person in this series, but fu izzy and kacis relationship is so underated ily all sm😝
Joyce is one of the most jarring people, always shouting
Danny referencing khabib like that is too funny
28:15 nah thats outrageous
Fun fact: In Brazil we have chicken hearts for barbecue all the time
ash caressing kaci to sleep🥺(37:33)
i didn’t use to watch madam joyce but i’m going to start. she’s soooo funny 😂😂
No hate but white guys will eat anything 😂😂😂
Fu is fucking hilarious 😂😂
fucking ridiculous mate
Danny win it for Silas Come on Danny
Nahh Fu staring at Danny while gagging was golddd 😂
proud of them all,you’re all my winners let’s be real!!!
The bromance between Danny and George is the reason why I'm watching, love them two
Ugh mate this seasons over already now I gotta watch some other shite for an entire year .
Can’t wait to never have to see Joyce again in my life😂sooo cringe constantly speaking in the most cringe way n shouting.
I honestly love fu and kacis bond the fact that he didn’t give up and said  kaci was his winner was so wholesome
George is so miserable in that challenge like Kaci was giving them positive energy and he’s like just shut up
Big up Danny and joyce- so funny and making the series so good. Shoutout mother Aaron’s too
The bit where they had to eat fish eyes fu and Joyce became dinosaurs
Fu definitely lost that challenge....half of his went in the bucket, I mean I'm glad casi is still in but damn she shouldn't be
Fu is a jelly back
Man said that cow was an uckers omdz 😂😂😂😂
The bond in this house is amazing. Joyce win this for us
can’t wait for joyce to come out and realise how little people like her now
Fu is winning this thing. Mark my words💯 And i still dont understand the hate on joyce but it's okay. Everyone has an opinion and i respect it💯
love how danny always talks to the girls when doing there make up and gives compliments, what a man 🙌🏼🙌🏼
get rid of joyce
Ash Holmes was the lengest on this series, Queen of the Footasylum locked in house 👸🏽
29:37 A WHOLE STORYLINE FRFR
Kaci is so leng ❤
39:08 I should be a verifed Joyce hater
Joyce trying the hardest to be centre of attention she's jarring man
Danny Aaron’s barmy army 🙌🏽👏🏽
I was actually dying of laughter when fu was eating 😭😭
Joyce is so annoying
Ngl George is a full on badass
I think George was just hungry lads.... feed the lad more
take a shot everytime Joyce says “ITS COCO POPS”. Goodnight! x
Wrong episode to eat my food 😭
We all know if Danny gets evicted then the views will go down dramatically
nah wth is wrong with george?? hes a beast, went through all the foods like it was nothing
Danny won. Sorry for the spoiler.
This episode was so wholesome. But I won't lie I was dying during that whole challenge 🤣🤣 I'm so happy they are all going to the final together. No evictions
Fu and Kaci giving brother sister vibe omg they are so sweet
Fu Izzy's face trying to eat that onion was jokes 🤣🤣
i watched for danny but i got to love every housemate sending love from 🇪🇬🇪🇬❤
Big up to George & Fu Izzy for that challenge 🎉 every time MJ screams I mute my tv (GG to her as well )
Fu being the big bro kaci needed all along ❤
16:55 I dont think Fu realises Danny pretty much has the backing of being in Sidemen vids / in that rough friend group
MY MAN FU WAS STRUGGLLLLIIIIINNNNNGGGGGGG
Fu and Joyce had me crying in the 6 course challenge
Fu talking about followers was so cringe, like grow up
nah joyce was straight buggin out last episode lol
Joyce is nearly getting more hate than cathrine in love island
It’s coco pops it’s coco pops 😂😂😂
Kaci and Ash 🫶🏽
Kaci and ash I love them both so much 🫶🏻
Ash is the most beautiful girl I didn’t know her at the start of this and now she’s one of my favs her beauty is unreal 🤍
joyce is so annoying
@footasylum you’ve done well with the contestens. Big up the production❤
FUUU  WAAAAAAAAA WAAAAAAAAA im crying
Joyce is the worst thing ever
Joyce getting gassed that she’s in the final… Brother you went out first you shouldn’t even be there.
28:19 STOP IT THATS CRAZYYYY FU IS SO FUNNY
Joyce: ITS COCO POPS ITS COCO POPS. kills me lmao 😂
Am I the only one crying with laughter 🤣🤣🤣🤣 hands down my favorite episode 😂😂
Kaci and ash are amazing you go girls 🎉
Joyce was so jarring in this video man someone I beg u send her out
George is a f-ing chad
kaci for the win!!!
danny is a another level
Danny saying "Wallahi its good for you, Wallahi its fine" is sending me LOL
The way George was so rude to kaci this episode is killing me 💀💀💀
Shut up joyce
Slightly savage that they show everyone else nice comments and just give Joyce a meh one
Danny needs to win this
Inshallah anyone other than Joyce to win Joyce is jarring
Posture Aarons is slowly coming back...
Only 39 minutes🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬😭😭😭😭😭😭😩😩😩😩😩😩
27:24 HELPPPPP
Joyce has to be the most jarring person to ever be in locked in
How do you vote for the winner?
fu izzys rapping such a vibe <3
I don’t think the housemates will see this, but we love everyone this szn sending love from egypt🇪🇬🇪🇬❤️
14:15 “ you end up in a cab home baby “ like you did before you snaked Watson to come back Joyce 😂😂
Fu saying that Kaci is his winner honestly warmed my heart ❤️
I dispise Joyce so much
Honestly i don’t really care who wins now. All of the housemates deserve it at this point. Just so happy to see all six of them go to the final round. Fu Izzy mad respect for you brother, the dedication to finish everything to safe Kaci was heartwarming❤️
its a shame Kaci is so quiet cos she's hilarious
Came here for Danny stayed for everyone
joyce is in for a surprise when she realises it’s 10 dislikes for every 1 like 😂😂
Love this show especially because of ash (partially because of her butt) but still love her so much
37:42 I’m sure his more surprised about talking to women as dude would hide away from em before😂
George is raa cold firmsing thst eyeball
FU’S EYE CONTACT HAD ME IN TEARSSS HELP AND DANNYS RE ENACTMENT
Ash😍😍😍 oh my days
Petition to swap Watson back in for Joyce 😂 she too jarring now 😂
People who comment hate for Joyce has to be because she’s a dark skinned black woman. It’s a tell as old as time. She’s my fave one in the house. Super glad she came back and made it this far. Big love to Madam Joyce❤
Respect for fu going through hell for kaci to get to the final big up him
NAH KACI IS AMAZING WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK
26:02 TSOP IT
Fu Izzy is a legend man big up
I hate the way George speaks to Kaci
I’d genuinely be interested in seeing how many people want Joyce off this show. I wish they had a poll of most wanted to be voted off vs most favorite
Loving Kaci !  coming out of her comfort. Love watching this season !!!!❤❤❤❤
danny was wearing girls cloth while they were speakin outside in the last 6 minutes😂
Why is Joyce screaming yeah you don’t like it but the need to scream omd
Joyce is a headache fr 🤦‍♀️🤯🤯🤯 ash for the win !!
I hope Danny wins it
Chicken hearts are not that bad neither is the cow tongue  😂 everyone was just overreacting
25:40 HELP NOT THE EYE CONTACT
There’s only one Danny aaraons. My winner
Kaci got done over in the eating challenge well done fu
Joyce in the finals is crazy
35:57 Damn Danny the ugly thing💀😂
joyce so much screen time for what
big up fu for going through that for kaci!! love their bond here ❤
i abs loved this episode because it showed how much they are capable of doing for each other. the fact that fu actually went thru with it when he was clearly struggling was so nice of him and i love danny's and george's friendship so much. honestly i would be happy with anyone winning it atp.
Absolutely love Joyce
Joyce giving the least for the audience
Respect to George for doing them all like it was nothing and to Fu for doing that for Kaci
The way y’all wore laughing at fu Izzy is crazy but fu Izzy I feel u😣
It's cocopufs
george im sorry but give kaci a hug dont tell my girl to shut up !
Those dishes gave me some strong GMM vibes.
Im so happy all of them got through, didnt wanna see any go. Rooting for Danny, Ash or George 🙏
Not Danny’s “purr queen” cracks me up every time 😂
This show is getting to squid games level of fucked up challenges 😭😭😭
Final rankings of my favourite housmates:  1) Danny 2) George 3) Ash 4) Kaci 5) Watson 6) Ten 7) Shan, Starz and Fu  10) Joyce
I draw the line at the cow's tongue, you'd be at yuh yaad! NOPE!
Joyce you are not the only one who’s surprised that you’ve made it to the final
Joyce said nothing but facts 14:35  Love her she’s so smart  Y’all should go and cryy😂
I don't get why Joyce is getting hate she is mad funny and so nice i love her
👹ITS COCO PUFFS👹iTs CoCo PuFfS👹😂
Loving Danny and george duo cant belive its almost over!
george was annoying me in this ep🙄 why he keep giving out to everyone!
14:36 always the victim 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 ur just anoyying it has nothing to do with you being a girl
I’m gonna be so sad when this is over it’s definitely my favourite thing to watch atm 🫶🫶
fu is the funniest person ever i was creasing at him with the cows tongue 😭😭😭
Tbh all the cast is banging this year the only person I found jarring was max khadar 😂
23:51 stan kac and danny!!!
Gotta be Danny or Kaci to win it!
I think Joyce is getting way too much hate ngl. She was quite shitty last episode but we all have bad days init
Kaci has to be
Personally I don’t like madam Joyce is so over dramatic she is so annoying get her out the house
Joyce is jarring
Ngl people call Joyce annoying but without her we’d all be bored and have nothing to talk about 🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️
HI
I JUST LOVE ASH WITH MY WHOLE HEART
ash ans kaci r the sweetest , my favs the whole way through 🫶
why Danny man
Honestly just bcs of todays eating challenge I hope fu wins
Can mj please stop shouting
joyce needs to stfu why tf is she screaming so much
I love Danny best fifa player of all time big up Danny fucking love him

Well done fu Izzy.  Kaci your doing amazing well done everyone in the house for getting through to final 😊
This is literally the best session EVER omg footasylum ur doing so good this year 👍🏼🧡
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂2 minutes in and Danny is killing me "Someone threw a pillow"😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Hiiiiiiiii
straight away i knew there was no way fu would let himself be responsible for kacis elimination.. he did SO well
George was honestly so nice this ep, making sure to finish it all and not even complaining or making a noise while also looking after the others - like patting Fu's back and handing him the tissue and stuff. Just loved to see it.
Joyce is so jarring
Funniest part is that was probably the nicest comment about Joyce
Fu killed me in the eating challenge, couldn’t stop laughing 😭😭
25:40 fu wants to unalive himself so bad here🤣
Nah Joyce I’m ded also ash 😐
How they gonna react like that to an onion
Danny is goated, love you mate 🐐
I love how ash took kaci under her wing and being her older sister❤❤
fu and kacis friendship is so underrated. you can see how hard he trued for her and he should genuinely be so proud of himself
fam joyce screaming “it’s coco pops” is killing me😂😂😂😂
I love kaci so much she is so sweet and love Dad V Girls. Ash OML love her personality. Season 4 is totally 🔝🔛
Nah fu CARRIED this episode, bro noises he made were HILARIOUS
george is a trooper the way that man ate all that without hesitation for his bromance
the best show george is so funny man
George and Danny friendship and that’s what we need too see through the whole show don’t go out now boys
So proud of kaci for getting this far and coming out of her shell so much x 💗
Kaci is so leng, when I’m a professional boxer I’ll be in her dms for sure
fu has me crying the way he’s staring into danny’s soul while he’s gagging 😭 love it
kaci sleeping while ash was stroking her hair was so cute
FU made this whole episode. What a guy. So happy for them all being in the final xx
kaci NEEDS to win , you got this girl. 💗
I don’t care who wins they all are class and deserve all the love in the world
man this is so rigged they want joyce to win
I can't lie this season is goated the cast is amazing
kaci deserves to win
Kaci motivating fu is true friendship
Them all singing happy birthday to Niko and Sharky 😭💀
Fu carried that food challenge like he rlly above and beyond for Kaci like fr
If anyone’s gonna win it’s George
george telling kaci to shut up was actually weird like it’s a challenge mate 18:45
I knew ash would be baddie all the way❤❤❤❤
My goat George firming the food easy and Danny keeping him at ease
watching kaci has been so wholesome, loved her since dad v girls day 1❤️
FU has been the best thing in this episode 😂😂😂
ngl kinda short episode for a semi final
I knew ash would be baddie all the way
Ash being such a mum to kaci is so cute love them
Danny I know you don’t have like your phone or social media but I can tell you that you are everyone’s favorite
PLEASE KICK OUT THIS JOYCE PERSON JESUS YOU JARRING! Leave.
Mate kaci is a G she is o nice and so funny
me gagging at fu gagging
Cow giving blows got be be dying 😂😂😂😂😂😂 fu 🐐
Fu in that eating challenge?! 🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂
Struggling to find a nice comment for Joyce I see.
Fu what a g man, he was genuinely absolutely hating it and stuck to it for Kaci.
Danny Aaron’s carried this season fr
It's great that no one got evicted today
how's the winner decided then cause we ain't been able to vote on the app once
yet to watch this but imma predict that joyce somehow doesnt leave and is as jarring as ever
Joyce is SO jarring.
the way george didnt really react to any of the eating challenges, thats insane, the connection with danny is REAL
nah this was the funniest episode yet 😂 I can’t, fu staring into Danny’s soul 😂😂😂 I could not stop laughing 🤣🤣🤣❤❤
Ngl kaci George and Danny r the best trio in the world. ❤
kaci and ash, man I live for them 🥹 when kaci was sleeping on the couch and ash was running her fingers through the hair 🥹🥹🥹🥹
Joyce really needs to cop on with the screaming like swear she’s getting stabbed or something
ash is so drop dead gorgeous and is the kindest human being out there x
I love everyone but Fu is so funny but well done guys 🎉❤
Joyce still doing the most lol
Can’t lie Joy is absolutely gorgeous, amazing and the kindest on there but can’t lie George is fine xxxxxxxx
Honestly happy for any of them except Joyce to win!!
Why did George hug Kaci as if he doesn't know her but hugged Ash as if they were long lost siblings 😂
Cow tongue fye we eat tacos with that 😮‍💨
I love the way that Fu Izzy still carries on eating the disgusting food when he’s throwing up, for kaci as he promised you can see a father figure there ❤
Whatever happens tomorrow. Everyone knows Danny and Kaci won season 4 ❤
The fact that goerge disappeared after the food challenge it was that bad
Why is George always telling kaci to shut up. Bless her ❤️
Kaciiiiiiiiiii whoooooooo
Skipping all of joice in the store room
I blacked out laughing at fu izzy eating everything
ItS NaNdOs
Fu the goat man what a guyy
Fu is killin me 😂😂😂😂
ItS cOcO pOpS ItS cOcO pOpS
Kaci for the win! Go on girl.. you’ve done everyone proud. Fu is the sweetest ❤
fu is the most underrated in the house but he is still smashing it,
Fu is making me feel sick the way he’s gagging
i love ash sm. i really hope she wins💛💞 also kaci is a slay
I’m loving Joyce, the season would have been boring without her💖💖
IT SENT ME WHEN JOYCE KEPT SAYING ITS COCO POPS WHEN EATING THE CRICKETS 😭💀
joyce is the most annoying in locked in history
I didn’t even know chicken had a heart. Am dead haha 😂😂
Tomorrow is the finals guys ... Man i didnt thin id be watching this for 4years straight hopefully it'll make it yearly like taskmasters
40mins? yeah challenges are important part of the show but why just basically show the challenges and nothing else. Needed story's behind every cast member, like a properly reality show, that's what the shows missing
George is a lad 💪🏽
Surely Danny is the winner
I love danny,s relashinship with the girs
its danny the king for sure👑
KACI OR ASH FOR THE WIN!!!!!!!
George is the GOAT, coming through for danny like an absolute trooper.
The way Joyce and George firmed it is incredible
Love fu for going through that for Kaci and when he said Kaci is his winner was really cute. Love you Kaci and Fu 💗💙
Haven't finished watching but the "purr queen" from Danny sent me 😭😂
Can’t wait for posture to win it all
I literally was rolling around  when Joyce was eating the cricket and she was it coco pops it's just cocopops coco pops 😂😂
Kaci is the actual best and I haven’t finished the video so if she leaves I’m going to cry
Ash is funny she always be tweaking
This was the funniest thing ever 😂 but when he was sick I started gagging aswell
Danny or kaci will win
I didnt know who fu was before this but i'm for sure a fan now this guy is comedy gold man
when fu said " no kacy in the final are you mad, shes my winner" was so wholesome
love Kaci and Ash so much the reason why i watched this season Kaci and Ash Slaaay x 💅💅
On momzies life i agree with Niko this show is FYEEE FR
hey QUEENS .... HEY KING👑
Joyce tryna play off her being annoying as sexism is so jarring
Funniest episode yet!!! Fu and kaci where the best team, they where hilarious!!!!
Joyce is so annoying
joyce is a good friend yo! she nailed the challenge, well done 👏🏼
Joyce is in it for the money 💯
Joyce screaming when eating is just to much, like shush.
Get joyce out
Nah this Danny guy is way too funny
Now I have to walk like I’ve shit myself😂😂
Who did joyce go down on to get to the final
Team ash since day1 love her!!
Fu said he was doing this for stars and showed his bum crack twice in 24h, man of his word. He really is the life of the party tho
Danny is the funniest guy I have ever watched he is so humble and kind to everyone in this season he is the best
LOCKED IN S4 WINNER IS................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Honestly my heart melted when I saw ash stroking kaci’s head 🥺🥺🥺
Kaci is like so pretty I have been watching dvg and Kaci hope your ok xx
Sorry but I was dying of laughter when fu was eating and giving story times to all the animals before eating 🤣🤣
Danny could actually win this and I'd be happy if he did too
It's just coco pops 😂😂 Joyce is so funny 😂
Fu's face when joyce was screaming😭😭😭
Fu deserves to win he is so sweet and he is just a rlly nice person . Well done Fu.
George is underrated bro he might win and he'd deserve it
Feel like footasylam is having a soft spot for Joyce for having 4 people in the final. And 3 will be eliminated tomorrow. Nahhh. Joyce was supposed to go today according to public votes
George be CALMMMMMMMMMMMM fam
This on was probs best yet!!!!!
Honestly when it comes to friendship Joyce dont play.. Love her soo much
I acc hope kaci wins she is such a vibe and I've been cheering for her the whole time xx
I’m so proud with kaci she has come along so munch in this I think it’s a good way to boost your confidence in that house ❤
Nahhh fu is the goat for that for reallll ❤
All of them singing happy birthday to Niko and Sharky when it’s no where near their birthdays is gold😂😂
That’s a good episode but I want someone to go out
Tbh if not for kaci's fan base she aint supposed to be in top 2
Kaci should be out rigged most off the food was in bucket Danny said that
It most certainly was not coco pops
Joyce is worse than Max for trying her hardest to get airtime or sound bites... adhd is the only reason she be screaming... get her out
i wish to never see and/or hear joyce again, sooo jarring
Also I’m gonna need a reunion video from them soon
fu was killing me to much with the food challenge
i kneww him and kaci had a good friendship i could tell they always chill together
Fuu is actually gonna make me throw up bro
Fu Izzy gagging at everything 😂
I’m eating my words, I apologize!
No matter what anyone says, Fu is a fighter and he deserves the Crown 👑
Fu at 38:52 is so wholesome
Hi love rhe video s and I hope kaci or daney wins
Today its my birthay and its funny how they sing random happy birthay to sharky and niko 😂❤
not joyce calling the crickets coco pops and downing the chicken hearts like medicine omg 😭🤣🤣
What Fu said about Kaci is so kind!  I won't be able to watch the final tomorrow when it's live and I am so gutted to find out who wins later than everyone else!!!
Did he manipulate them into singing happy birthday to Niko and Sharky 😭
George smashed that big up him unreal fair play Danny got some teammate there
“I hate how I’m speaking in this place”  “Day 13 in this bombaclaart building”  Danny😭😭😭😭
Everyone talking about how well fu izzy did ( he did very well ) but George ate everything like a champ no complaints nothing he did it for his brother Danny
its co co popps had me dyin
i dont know what was up with george this episode but bloody hell, chill out a little. he is being so awkward and rude to kaci
I love Danny so much
we are all proud of you for coming this far well done guys🎉
Its not bone you chewing George its straight up cartilage
Fu Izzy to win
Joyce is proper drama queen these last 2 days starting  to grind me 😕
Naaaaa George is a born beast hatss offf
pog
Joyce has too much screen time
I hope Kaci wins
Danny's khabib impression was top notch
Love this show. Big up fu izzy and danny love them
Fu Izzy is so funny and underrated we all love him
the way fu talks about kaci is so wholesome
I love you all am so proud of all of you
Kaci for the win!! 🎉❤
Kaci+George=❤️❤️❤️
Did she mean og fat girl 💀
Kaci falling asleep w ash is the cutest. Ash has proper took to kaci and I love that!!
I love the older sister duo with Ash and Kaci its so lovely to see kaci come out and there both legends!!!x
What Happened to George that episode I barely saw him😢😢😢😢. Maybe the episode was just short
Tbh Danny is him people say he’s all that on stream but when’s he doing this he’s such a nice and genuine guy
'humpty dumpty yute'😂 If Ash doesnt win then oh my
i love kaci and ash’ friendship they’re like mum and daughter 🥹
George was hating this episode acting bare 🍎🍉🍇 aswell
I love kaci so much she is so adorable and her teamwork is amazing ❤
Danny is such a funny guy man, I  always know he's gonna make me laugh
I want danny to win but i think kaci will win because of her fan followings... I think it will go like this  1 - Kaci 2 - Danny 3 - George 4 - Ash 5 - Joyce 6 - Fu Izzy 🤔
Yayyy!! KACI JAY CONDER FOR THE MF WIN
Niko Omilanas next video, ' I tricked the Locked in House that is was My Birthday '
Is it just me or was George being a kn*b in the food challenge like be supportive
Vote for Danny to win
We love Kaci what a gorgeous girl inside and out she’s gotta be the winner 🏆 🫶🏽Love our girl Ash too
Ngl Fu looking mad uncomfortable and in pain, but its so funny🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Joyce - “For every one person that hates me, there are 10 more that love me.” She couldn’t have been further from the truth
Dani and Gorge are going home single after there girlfriends watch these episodes 😂 they cuddle like they’ve been dating for years 😂
Tennessee wasn’t the most jarring, Joyce is.
Fu pissing me off what is a big man doing can't eat a bloody onion
i have a feeling danny is going home single 👀
FUU man😂 this brudda is too funny 😂😂 HOPE HE WINS
LOVED this episode!!
Kaci is my favourite and ash as well
Fu’s cow tongue backstory 😭
if one of you from this season are reading this comment you guys are amazing i don't think i would wait for every episode  every single day if it wasn't you guys no matter who wins you all did good bravooooo
Guys you are all doing so welll❤❤❤❤❤❤
Fu Izzy’s reaction to Madame Joyce screaming got me laughing so much, but the stories he was telling about the cow 😂😂
i lost all respect of fu this video. that was the most embarrassing thing ive seen in a while
I love Danny.What a GOAT
L Joyce hasn’t got booted out
first starplayers bumcrack now fu izzys😂
get joyce off doing me fucking head in no need to scream and shout 24/7
FU IS THE LEGEND !!!
I love this show kaci ash and Joyce are giving
I genuinely love kaci and literally everyone they are all so entertaining love them
One day I will marry kaci
I take lots of comfort from knowing that they’ll all be happy for whoever wins
danny and mj could make a good couple
Goodness this isn’t good for a person with emetaphobia. When I tell you I’m nearly throwing up myself from fu gagging😩
kaci and fu friendship is actually so cute and wholesome
Joyce just isn't it
Ngl I liked George at the beginning of the series but damn his attitude is not the one at times
Wish I was in this house.. vibes are elite 👏👏
FU has me creasing 😂😂
anyone else get a cow ad after?🤣
i love kaci
Danny and Kaci my favs  Kaci is so pretty tbh 😢😂
I love ash and kaci hopefully one of them win this .there friendship is so cute 💜
When the coco pop’s kicked in lol 😂
Fu trying to downplay 1.3 million followers compared to 1.4 million to Danny was so weird the most classic form of projection
Joyce screaming "it's coco pops" has finished me🤣🤣🤣
Fu is hilarious this episode. I literally can’t stop laughing
Wish I could mute Joyce Ngl
The way Fu went through that for Kaci was heartwarming. I genuinely don't think he would have gone through that if it was to save himself from elimination
Footasylum should have done it by adding a twist into the challenge. For example, the person who failed to save their partner from elimination by failing the challenge is the one who is actually sent home. Shock value + More entertainment loool.
Ash seems like the best bestfriend a girl can have ❤
The 2 people that need to go are not allowed to be evicted! Ash, kaci and Danny need to be in the final!
Fu is a troll does he really think it was niko and sharkys birthday because that was hilarious 😂🐐
I watched Danny before this but I’m watching him even more cause of this
That girls moment pissed me off 😭
SOMEONE TELL JOYCE THAT SHE IS A LOSER
where qadar
I loved how they all sucked it up in the challenge to save the other, I would actually want ash to win ngl
in this episode
Joyce fought her way to the final despite all the hate she's been getting. I have to respect that. She's definitely a winner in my eyes.
to danny arrons xoxo, spurs got robbed against chelsea😔
Does anyone else fast forward when Joyce is talking in the store room or is it just me
George doing it for Danny without hesitation... thats a true friend
everyone left deseverves the win
Danny Aaron’s is my spiritual animal
Who got evicted
I rate George for not throwing up once, he was doing it for his Boyfriend Danny 😂
fu izzy and kaci are such a sweet duo
before I watch the rest of the video I already know Joyce is gonna win the food eating challenge. I'll reply back if she doesn't. MARK MY WORDS.
I was only a fan of Danny and Kaci beforehand, had no idea who Fu was but he would definitely be the most deserving winner, he’s such a nice guy and proved how great he is by not giving up that challenge for Kaci
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉😂😂
If kaci or Danny wins I’m happy
Annyyy Daarons for the winnnnn!!! Can't wait for FootAsylum Sn 4 winner on your name🎉
Why does Joyce always bring gender into the convo. So jarring man
look at kaci just laying there sleeping with ash stroking her hair that is so cuteee
Why is ash so hot i cant
someone tell joyce to shut up 🥱
Fu making eye contact with Danny 😂😂😂
Fu absolutely smashed that Gowan he threw up and kept going for kaci their friendship is unreal fu I have mad respect for you
Guys help I keep seeing star players bumcrack but now fu
33:32 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
want kaci to win this!!
Lets go Danny im awaiting your arrival!!!
Huge respect for Fu Izzy after that. But the eye contact sent me. 🤣
fu really deserves the win this the goat fr
Joyce screaming and ash being like “stay calm” I’m dead 😭
The Danny And George Duo Is Unreal
stop giving joyce hate what if somone said it to u
I hope that George and Danny are going to film in the future
I would loved to be LOCKED IN with danny 😘
I actually just love with Kaci, her friendship with everyone is beautiful :)
Joyce is trying so hard for one of the girls to be in the final, find it jarring
Joyce is over the top never in my life have I came across an more embarrassing person 😅
Watching from Argentina! Let’s go Kaci 🩷🩷
If danny doesnt win i will die
We need this longer😂 Danny for the W!!!
Danny Aaron's for the win
you can tell evryone cares so much about each other this season
Can't believe the way George was speaking to Kaci in the challenge, telling her to shut up like that was disrespectful asf
Honestly well done to all of them fought hard to keep eachother in best season by far been laughing so hard with danny fu had me in tears stars is so missed same as shannon wow kaci really has come out and joyce, ash and george they are real ones 💯
I think Joyce really likes coco pops, the way she screams for it
Joyce just screams for no reason 🤦please stop 😂
Joyce shouldn’t be there
Its nice to see danny outside his room and not playing fifa and i hope him and madame got the fattest ass in the whole world joyce hit it off
its so cute how ash calls everyone bubs and bubba💗
Aye yo George is the G my guy ! ! Coldest moments that eating challenge
Favorite locked in season
39 mins should be crime
joyce is so feckin anooying
Is it just me getting the vibe that George is weird with kaci.. getting the vibe his a hater.. love kaci bless her ❤
Wallahi my boys fu, Dadd- i mean Danny and George along with the girls deserve the win, Ricky Ricky one time
Lets be honest, if Danny was evicted early on the views would have dropped massively
Bra we eat chicken heart neck and liver in south Africa Not raw tho I'm not stupid
Production needs a raise after this episode. 10/10 I was definitely entertained!❤
Bro ash is such a nice person and fu Izzy’s voice is so good
Fu is goated uk, underrated humor and great personality. Need him back on SDS though.
Fu couldn't hack the eating
Gonna miss these lot ❤ locked in saving me a brill afternoon
25:46😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
i love fu hes so kind but funny at the same time 😂❤️‍🩹
its so cute how they see kaci as there little sister
Ash and Kaci are my favs both hilarious and seem so genuine🥰🥰
Nahhhh fu Izzy got me dying 😭😭😭😭
Kaci,ash and mk are like sisters they are the best🫶🏻🫶🏻
can we just admire Fu Izzy for a second. The way he made sure to keep his promise for Kaci is just beautiful❤ loved everyone in this season
bit harsh of fu on danny
Danny and George is literally the best duo on earth.
ash stroking kaci’s head is EVERYTHING 🥹
Joyce gets wayyy too much screen time ffs she’s sooo annoying it’s crazy
Ash definitely has the whole package man. Shes beautiful, smart, and genuinely such a sweet person. She deserves to win
I’m so glad everyone’s through to the finals ❤ good luck guys
Such a short episode :((( upset that it will be the last one tomorrow :(
Ash letting kaci sleep is honestly the cutest thing ever
Joyce is such a beg, wdym you didn’t think you’d go to the final? You literally turn the house into boys vs girls so you wouldn’t get voted out. So jarring.
Danny Kaci and George my top 3 predictions. Would be happy if anyone of those three wins Tom. Best of luck to all 6 tho
You can tell the housemates are privileged. that whole onion, when I was a kid I used to eat hole of them because we had nothing else to eat.
i swear FU  is the funniest that guy omg love him
Team Captain Fu, this Brudda is too funny, I think it should be Fu and Kaci ftw ❤️❤️
Omg kaci is literally the best. I love her so much. I hope she wins.
danny😂 finds throwing eggs immature but first episode he was winging oranges at people😂 he’s a laugh
big mouth joyce and that
George did that challenge like it was nothing fair play
I'm not ready for the final its gone so fast this is the best season yet they are all winners especially Danny,Kaci and Fu izzy.
Joyce struggling eating the eye had me dying ngl💀🤣
Not that i wanted kaci to go home, but fu never finished the cow tongue
Joyce needs to stfu I can’t stand her
Fu was doing the most, everything they ate actually tastes alright. Being from Mexico I've eaten everything at it's pretty nice. (Except the smoothie, but I've had brain tacos and they're good)
Danny has to be the winner
What got me thinking is when George repeatedly said shut up to kaci 😢
footasylum managed to rig the whole thing and get joyce to the finals bravo👏
Cmon kaci you can do this!! Ive been a fan of hers since she was like 14, seeing here all grown up makes me so proud, she will win this!!
Fu Izzy fr the goat for what he did for Kaci🙌
Fu izzy is my new favorite after this one 😂
“That cow gave hella blows”
is it just me or is george being so rude to kaci throughout the whole thing
George absolutely CARRIED the banquet. COME ON
Get Joyce in the bin
couple mans gyal are pissed at home😂
i really hope ash wins, she is so funny and small like me 😂💞
Kaci and Fu are such a nice duo the oldest and the youngest ❤
Kaci For The Win FR🩷🏆
KACI FOR THE WINNN
I never understood y tongue is considered disgusting,  even on jimmy kimmel. We eat it in SA as a "fancy" meat and its delicious when done correctly
fu treating kaci like his little sis is the cutest thing i have seen all day🫶🏽
If somehow you haven’t realised none of us want Joyce in there anymore
Joyce being in the final is insanity
That cow definitely an uckers 😂😂😂😂 fu killing me
Wending
Oh my goodness. Fu’s words at the end made me tear up. Wow. Fu is so amazing for saying that❤
Why is footasylum showing Joyce only bad comments trying to put her mood down. Heads up girl we love you!
big upps to Nicco and Sharky happy birthday 🎉
I love Fu & Kaci’s friendship it’s honestly the best and him saying he done it for Kaci & that Kaci’s his winner🩷🫶🏽🏆
Does anyone els think Joyce’s laugh is bare annoying 😂😂
Fu deserves a nobel peace prize after that performence
Joyce so annoying bro - doing the most ain’t a good thing
Video should come with a headache warning because where was the need for the screaming during that challenge
Fu in the eating challenge lmao. 🤣
IT’S COCO POPS IT’S COCO POPS
Super proud of Joyce-Anne 🫶🏾
I just don’t want SZN 4 to end even tho I know it is tomorrow🥰🩷
Cmon dannyyyyyyyyyy get in there boys
Wallahi Danny wills
Fu was going through it 😂
Fu is now my favourite his reactions and when he was staring into Danny’s soul has just killed me
Big up, Fu izzy for holding it down for Kaci ❤❤
YESSS GUYSSS! GO ON!
Well done fu izzy❤u smashed it
Bro how is Joyce still in she’s the worst contestant of all time
George ate those meals like a champ tbf 🫡
JOYCE FR NEEDS TO SHUT UP, SHE AINT THE MAIN CHARACTER AND IS DOING EVERYONES HEAD IN
Joyce had me dying laughing ☠️☠️
KACI FOR THE WINN. big up kaciii
Fu, Joyce and George are real troupers for this challenge...best at the food challenges in Footasylum history
Joyce being in the final is crazyyy
Love all the housemates
i love  how supportive fu izzy is to kaci i get every word he says im here for kaci and fu izzy i hope one of them wins the finals cant wait for next ep xx!!!!!!!love you all
Fu is a beautiful human being I like that men great personality and everything love my guy❤
Funniest episode yet, i was laughing like an idiot alone in my room but I couldn’t  hold it in
Tbh seeing a large bunch of em moving on is cool asf
Fu izzy is my guy bro
The best season, The best people, Couldnt ask for anything else <3
36:11 madam Joyce looking like the dragon from shrek
Ash stroking kacis hair was the cutest ❤I'm so happy no one has gone
Let’s be honest it’s between the boys and ash that should win
Ofc Joyce is good at eating, just look at the size of her!
Joyce screaming is acc starting to piss me off
Their reactions when everyone went through to the final ❤🥹 !
Funniest episode through the entire season I absolutely adore Joyce’s reactions and fu’s reaction to the meals, couldn’t stop laughing😂😂
Joyce is the most jarring person I’ve ever had to listen to
again and again, Joyce reminded me how jarring she is with all her unnecessary yelling
wait why did nobody go home it thought there was supposed to be a double eviction
Kaci is sooo entertaining and every time she laughs is hilarious
FootAsylum know who the most popular is Danny is in nearly every thumbnail
Your going to feel sick if your all making noises and forcing it
get the whale out. we've seen enough
No because Kaci, Danny and ash are my favourite!!❤
Fu was acting like a freaking child during the challenge, mate just eat the onion and move no need to act as if your whole family got shot wallahi
Kaci the best looking in the house😍
Ashe seems like such a nice person to have as a friend I love her so much
Let’s goooooo Danny
Big up fu for doing that for kaci, bruv looked like he was being tortured. And when he made them sing happy birthday for sharky & niko when nikos bday is long gone and sharkys is more than a month away 💀the friendships between ash and kaci and fu and kaci is underrated. Sitting down with my food at 7pm and watching this show has been my favourite thing for the past two weeks, I’m sad tomorrow’s the last day.
Joyce is so jarring
Ngl joyce ruined this season for me just strange activities from her
This was probably my favorite episode 😂😂😂 Joyce and Fu screaming during the food challenge had me SCREAAAMMMING😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
I love looked in❤, s4 is the best season ever
Fu eating and throwing up was the funniest thing this season 😂😂
Danny and George are such a good bromance I would love to see more even after the house
Kaci rocking that des vu like always
Joyce happy to be there but she shouldn't be got told to leave once telling ppl this is fixed and she immune really
Kaci’s always my fav she’s such a nice girl ❤
Why does Joyce have to scream all the time it’s so jarring
i love danny i like how hes so energetic
i love fu he gives such positive energy !! what you need being in a house for 14 days
2:02 right “someone”😂
now this has been the best episode going fu making the noises made new laugh 😂😂😂😂
fu and kaci tho today was such good pair. Its so sweet fu did that all for kaci. acc proper teamwork!
Joyce doing way too much with the screaming, shut up and swallow your food man. George’s ears been exposed to an unhealthy amount of screaming
Fu is too funny man😂😂😂
Kaci is so sweet , love her personality and she is rocking des vu everyday 💖💖
The way ash was playing with kacis hair while she slept on the sofa was so lovely. I love all of you and we all are so proud!! All of u are the winners in my heart! ❤
nah mate i needed an elimination that challenge was pointless.
IM GONNA BE SO SAD TMMRW I LOVE THESE PEOPLE
i actually want to know who won rn
Hats of to everyone for being in the final. Tomorrow will be interesting x
It’s coco pops had me dying 🤣
I can't believe it ends tomorrow it's my favourite show 😢
So proud of fu doing that for Kaci he was struggling sm I didn’t think he would make it GOODLUCK GUYS
Fu really is a master manipulator 😂😂😂
Kaci and Ash are my favourite! She’s like kacis older sister and their relationship is honestly amazing❤
Locked in is rigged, Starting from Joyce's elimination and come back.. George or Fu Izzy are the deserving winners
love kaci and fu
icl, George is elite. G firmed everything for Danny. Respect for him is thru the roof
fu izzy should be so proud of him sell he did so well it really shows he’s there for kaci
Love Joyce and ash best duo fr
kaci omg she is fireeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
I so truly hope kasi or ashe wins. I want kaci to win but at the same time Ashe is a genuinely nice soul
joyce is worse than that one girl last season
Kaci for the win 🎉
Kaci is a queen but the way she tells fu Izzy to thing that the onion is a apple 😂😂😂
George and Danny the best Brotherhood on the 'net cuz how did George eat all that without even shaking once 👏👏👏
Kaci so fit
Was that meat HALAL?
This episode is crazyyyy 😂😂😂 I can't stop laughing
Crazy how no. One got evicted again
Fu Izzy especially this episode was class and soo funny got me dieing😂😂😂
Kaci is sooooo cute
Get Joyce the fuck out danny kaci George Ash and fu in the final
‘Do u legally identify as a dwarf’ 💀💀💀
I’m dead 😭😭
joyce is pissing me off icl
joyce is so irritating ffs just do one
It’s so refreshing to see someone as wholesome as fuizzy
Ash when you’re out link me 😙 ash for the W
Nah them signing niko and sharky happy birthday is too funny😭
Humpty Dumpty yute lol 😂😂
Omg I’m literally gagging so hard rn bc of eye 😅 I was laughing at fui but now I know how it feels
It’s coco pops “had me dying  🤣
The way I had to skip half the vid cause I could not stand the vomiting noises 😭
NO THE CLIFFHANGER-
Imagine Watson stayed in and Joyce went out
George was so sweet stroking Fu Izzy’s back during the challenge!
Kaci all the way, her vibes are immaculate (shes also very leng)
joyce saw jesus
Danny is my favourite housemate he is so funny and just brings that mood that lightens everyone up keep up the good work everyone
Fu & Kaci's bond is honestly so underrated. This episode shows the sibling bond they have, agreed with Fu aswell Kaci for the win. Danny close 2nd❤
Bro how George ate everything unfazed, it was a mental battle for him
When ash was stroking Kaci while she was asleep was so wholesome!
This season was worse compared to the last 2, we need points back. Also better secret challenges
Big up Fu
The way fu talks about kaci is the cutest ever
Joyce being in and Ten being gone is a big L ngl.
Joyce is so annoying. Overreacting to everything.
I was throwing up or pissing myself
Fu Izzy and Madame Joyce overreacting and screaming with every food and george just sitting in the middle and firming it all was the funniest part😂
Onions... NO. I couldn't do that! I HATE onion!!!
Is it all of them in the final them ?
Can we just say George is the G, not even a hesitation or doubt he was keeping his boiii in. That’s a ride or die friendship bro
George was such a trooper. No noises. He’s like enjoying the experience, chewing everything. Big up man that was amazing!
FU’S FACE AT 25:46 😂😂😂
RESPECT FUU PLEASE.
And the winner is ❤
All these comments bout kaci 😂 fuck me. She’s done fuck all ffs
Lol the maths at 11:36 😂  And Fu's death stare at 25:44 killllllllleedd me, my stomach hurts 😭🤣 there was a split second he looked like he was holding back the laugh but went full committal xD
No one leavesssss
Ash is the best big sister ❤
KACI JAY FOR THE WINNNN🎉🎉🎉
It's tough but I think Kacy is the winner. It's between George, Kacy and Danny.
I love how Danny  makes everyone smile and is really nice.
I guess you could say Joyce ATE that up!
Honestly thought Fu was gonna be Rachel 2.0
From the bottom of my heart, ash is the most kindest person ever. The way she’s always hyping everyone up and always smiling gets my heart going ❤
Joyce need to shut up!!! Omg stop giving her all the airtime…. KACI ALL THE WAY🎉
Danny boy for the win
GOWAN FU AND GEORGE 💪
Kaci is doing so well hope she wins this love u Kaci ❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉

Honestly big ups to Fu for going through that just for Kaci. He could've said he's done and just let Kaci get eliminated but he held his own. Respect 🙌🏼
George is an absolute hero. Done all them meals without batting an eye. King shit right there

So happy for all of you! You all KILLED it. Honestly, best series I’ve watched. Congrats guys! 🎉
So happy Joyce, George and especially Fu stood on business during that challenge!!
Did anyone get eliminated?
Ash’s laugh has my heart 😂
George telling Kaci to shut up was kinda rude ngl
Kaci, you are smashing this girl!! My winner either way 💗Also Fu saying "no kaci in the final are you mad thats my winner" made me SO happy !! xxx
i think danny wins it all!!!! genuine guy love his energy he gives out in the house!!!!

I was so happy when they all made it through to the final congrats to them 🎉

Chubby Joyce is delusional
Genuinely loove how Kaci was so appreciative after every meal🥺❤
Danny kaci and george in the top 3
I love how Fu is so eager for Kaci to win
Love kaci she is so nice to everyone
Gonna miss everyone such an amazing episode
Footasylum have fucking ROBBED us that Joyce needs to leave NOW. I’ve had enough of them rigging her to stay in she was gone at the start she shoulda stayed gone. And they robbed us of an elimination a final with 6 people is shite
I have never laughed so hard in my life, ash coming into the frame when fu was singing is too teir 🤣
Fu and Joyce just screaming either side of George who's looking like he's hating life 🤣🤣
Even footasylum didn’t want Joyce to win 🤣🤣 Fu Izzy didn’t even eat the whole thing!  Joyce is Extra AF.
i have so so much love for fu omg he deserves the whole world 🫶🫶
Fu has never made me laugh this hard 😭😭😭😭😭
Ash is so genuinely nice. I really want her to win !!
Kaci is beautiful and I hope she win the season 4 ❤You are so strong Kaci 💪
Kaci and Danny carry
Fu was so funny omg 😂 rooting for you kaci❤
If i controlled locked in for a day , first thing I'd do is kick Joyce out , zero hesitations.
Cmon kaci!!
Kaci is such a genuine person and brings so much to the house 😀
Naah man, Goerge is actually him
KACI OR FU FOR THE WIN🎉🎉
Danny is just the best hype man
Woooh 🎉
Wow all of those foods we eat regularly in my culture😅
I rate George so much from that you know that’s crazy
ash and fu are honestly the cutest how they looked after kaci
I love the way that Fu issy was gust singing😂😂😂
FUUU I’m dying hahaahah
KACI & FU ❤️❤️
Joyce is actually so annoying don’t know how she made it this far honestly
Joyce is so jarring. Like have your personality sister stop saying "its giving" "period" and talking like an American ratchet lol... Danny or Kaci w
I love Ash’s energy she’s the women all of us need in our life, so funny and such a good vibe
Ngl fu izzy carried this episode🤣🤣
I want someone to look at me the way fu looked at Danny when he ate the tongue
Danny my guy win it all bro hes too funny always cracking me up
idc who wins as long as it isnt joyce or ash
"the cows were telling the one cow shake that ass for drake" KILLED MEEEE, LMAO FU IZZY MY GUY
why is joyce such a freak
YESS I WAS DREADING YESTERDAY THAT SOMEONE WAS GOING OUT BUT THEY ALL MADE IT TO THE FINAL BUZZINGG
Those meals are eaten as breakfast in a certain part of Africa,light work😂
Joyce laughing at fu izzy was too funny😭😭
Final is gonna be crazy
Your country 6mil russia 51mil😂 Comedy gold
joyce girllll jarringg 31:37
I feel bad for Fu but his reactions to the food is killing me😂😂😂😂
icl Joyce, jarring
Nah fu is killing me with his grunting 😭
joyce and fu get out! danny kacy and ash and george to the next round!
Kaci and George are my favourites they just too cold
Joyce : why is my food looking at me  The food: all the food you've ate looked at you you whale
Joyce is too much
They shouldn’t do finals like this cuz obviously kaci is gonna win with her big fanbase. When it should be fu, he literally has kids. Kaci is a teen and already has so much money
Man Joyce pisses me off
I love kaci,ash and danny so ima be sad :(..THEY LITERALLY MY FAV 3!!
George being rude to Kaci telling her to shut up is a bit yuck for me
fu rlly said that cow is a jezzy he’s too funny 😂😂😂😂😂
Ash your outfits are giving so much and your makeup is impeccable you just keep thriving and being you xx
ASH looking absolutely dashing as usual!
That Joyce bird is the most annoying creature I’ve ever witnessed
Madam Joyce is so funny I can’t lie. I love her!
Why was George so mean to Kaci bro wtf
so glad to see everyone in the final, they all deserve it
I AM LAUGHING MY OWN GUTS OUT WHEN I JUST SEEN JOHCE SCREAMING FROM HER LUNGS GOING THERE LOOKING AT ME
George’s compare during the big banquet was nuts
George pushes Fu to the other side lol 😂
I feel kinda bad for george and kaci near the end when they hug, you can tell people shipping them has really made their friendship in their awkard
Come on Danny!!
Joyce during the eating challenge was top tier hilarious
I love kaci she has grown so much and ash is the has the funniest personality ❤️
It's coco pops it's coco pops 😂😂😂😂😂
Fu sound like a COD zombies character during the challenge had me rolling 😂
How anyone can hate Joyce is beyond me🤣 such a funny girl
Danny is too funny I can’t lie 😂😂
I would of failed at the onion cant lie
Danny should win this
us in south africa looking at these made suffering to eat chicken hearts
fu really sent them with the niko and sharky birthday 😂
Wow what an episode fam speechless Wallahi
Both of there birthday's aren't even in October
Petition to swap and evict Joyce.. she was eliminated once before.. and shes the only housemate left that nobody wants to see win.. the other 5 all bring the vibes and the eyes.. noone will be mad at Danny, Kaci, Ash, George or Fu winning.. but Joyce even being last 3 is outrageous
It's sad whoever leav I hope the best for them
Awh Kaci is so cute in this eating challenge 😂
Kaci is actually the cutest can’t even ,but Fu is so sweet :)
GOOD ON YOU ALL! ❤❤
Ash and Kacy at the end are so cute
How is kaci single
LOVE THIS SHOWWWWWW❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
fu in that food challenge is the best thing ive ever seen
I honestly adore all of you lot but I love kaci sm 💓 she's stunning and pretty x
18:26 thats so sweet, i alr know fu would be so sad if he was the reason kac left :(
Kaci or Danny for the win
Danny and George's bromance fr carrying
Their mentality to finish is world class💪
i love joyce but omg she just needed to shut up in this challenge. kinda ruined the whole episode and i was so excited for this one
Joyce is so fucking annoying. Gobby weapon, she's the girl in school who acted hard and no one liked
Kaci and Ash are such a vibe ❤❤❤❤
its coco pops
the whole group is vibes cant wait for the last episodeeee
26:11 😂😂😂😂😂
Joyce just annoys me she is such a attention seeker
I love fui his and Kaci’s relationship is so wholesome
i wish all 6 could win. loved this series! fu is so genuine
Watching you guys, every day brings me joy🎉
Voting on kaci the whole way <3
Can Joyce stop screaming
Mate as a Viet kid i can never understand how people in the west can react like this when eating this food. It's such a foreign concept to me. Bro the fish eye is the best part of the fish. My mum putsj pig heart in soup. It's just soondae. Id argue with my sister for who gets it. Brain smoothie i dont like mornhave i had though.
WOOO KACI BETTER WINN THISSS
18:05 FU IS LIKE A BIG BROTHER TO KAC AWHHH
so proud of fu like i want him to win
Ash going yard
The editors who bleep all the swear words out need a raise. 🤣🤣
Fu izzy's comment about not doing it if he didn't have kaci made me smile sm
Joyce really getting annoying
Man they were off with the birthdays by MONTHS 😂 11:41
i cant wait for tmrw  hopefully kaci winssss🎉🎉🎉
I know my fellow Africans would smash the eating challenge 😂😂
I have been a fan of Danny since his iconic Clip of "mum I've got 443 subscribers" I think he is my favourite in the house! Danny how about an 11x George chooses my EAFC team
So proud of fu Izzy and so happy he done that to keep kaci in is just amazing ❤❤❤
Honestly great show but there must be some sickos behind these challenges i mean how do you even think of these foods.
Forget Madame Joyce doing the most she is doing the best! "Its coco pops" is the catch phrase of the season.
Kaci and danny>>>❤
Fact fu didn’t care it was a cows tongue, just the fact it might’ve sucked 😂
Ash can’t leave 😭 c’mon Joyce !!!
George be low-key savouring that chicken heart and cow tounge
That challenge was crazy
fu bloody killed me 😂
I am so sad that this season is Neely done and where max
kaci gonna win
At the end when Kaci was asleep on ash, it was the cutest thing ever😊 love ash and Kaci🤍
madam Joyce is the most jarringest person ever how she surviving all these days joketing
Why is Danny doing Khabib impressions 😂😂
Praying Danny goes to the finals with Kaci and with the immune people aswell
George and danny are sexy
I love season so much and the cast so sad when finished. I would love if Kaci got the finale she a amazing ❤
Can't lie, Joyce is pure beauty! Her makeup is always giving - even though she doesn't need it!!!! ❤❤
I just hope Joyce does not win
I love Ash, what a kind and genuine human being ❤❤❤❤💜💜💜💜
When i tell you i am SCREAMING at Fu eye contact with Danny eating cow tongue 😭
I love ash with kaci while she was sleepin ❤❤
fu such a wet baby just eat the food man fs
No pun intended, but George was Locked In for the food challenge
15:12 OH YEAH 'PURR QUEEN'
i was so scared fu wouldnt eat it alll🤮
why did they bring joyce back tho?? thats just unfair to everyone else, still confusin till this day
Fu saying kacis his winner is so cute bless him
Just an idea. Imagine footasylum somehow managed to get speed on next year's locked in. That would be entertainment.
Joyce mocking Fu when she makes worse noises herself lol
can't lie first L locked in
Big up kaci I hope u win love u ❤x
Coco pops
Fu mixing up niko and sharkys birthday is hilarious
get joyce out i say, all she does is yappa yappa yappa. her big ass stole kaci from getting the chair cause she’s that big
Joyce saying the crickets were coco pope actually got me cracking up!(PS:your bonnets are slaying!)
Eating challenge is unfair when you have MJ sitting there 😑
Love kaci loving the outfits hoping she stays till the final
i love how ash is being a comfort blanket for kac since ten left, its so wholesome
humpty dumpty yute is a mad ting 😂
Danny on Khabib vibes 😂😂
Kaci and ash are amazing and Kaci gets through this series well done
Kaci I’m really hoping for you to go the finals❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Fu saying Kaci is his winner is so cute fr
Joyce should go on ima celeb after that she's smashed it!
needs to be a public vote to remove joyces immunity every time she gets it
The zoom in on kaci when the boys were singing the girls song actually got me 😭
Fair fucking play to them 3 for eating all that shite
George ate that shit without making a single sound, that’s a man I’d go to war with
the birthdays
Danny is just jokes by far my favourite
thank god none of them went home. I cant imagine this without any of them!
Danny=🐐
Joyce hears her comment and instantly starts doing the most then goes upstairs to talk the most. So jarrin get her out man 😂
Came for the Danny vibe but this is the best series I have ever watched❤
They knew what they were doing sending everyone to the final🫡
I love Madam Joyce saying it's Coco pops she is such an icon
George looks like Enzo Fernandez
Joyce is so annoying
i showed this to my step dad, his favorite is already danny <3
Surely Fu should of gone he barely ate any cow tongue
12:58 HAHAHAHA
who`s birthday is it again????🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Kaci's fit is on point. I love how she has her own brand clothes. Praying you gets to the finals, girl.❤❤❤
The “it’s coco pops” had me dead 😂😂
Danny is the goat prove me otherwise

11:13 STAN ASH SO HARD SHES SM FUN
Fu getting everyone to sing happy birthday for Niko and Sharky was peeeeak 😂
They spared Joyce with the comments 😂😂. If they showed last episode commentes she would’ve cried
For every one person that hates me there’s 10 that love me couldn’t be more wrong if you tried ahahahah
Who do you guys want to win? I want kaci to win
absolutely love kaci would be devastated if she doesn’t win, love the vibe in the house!🥰

Joyce the type to push to the front of the line then kiss her teeth at complaints 😅😂
kaci is my fav she’s  the girl everyone wants to be friends with
Lock in is the series I didn't know I needed
Fu at the end talking about kaci made me sob
Kaci is rocking her des vu love her ❤

Kaci is so kind and funny. She deserves to win
I love MJ she’s such a baddie queen who inspires me the whole way
Big Batty Bigger Heart. Ash we love you yeah.
Joyce is soo wrong ita every 1 person who likes her its 10 people who hate haha 😂
fu is jokes maaan, crazyyy how he made everyone sing happybirthday
Go guys ❤❤❤❤
39:47 😂😂😂😂
Joyce is so meady
I hope kaci winss
Fu just gagging his way through the challenge😂
If kaci doesn’t win there’s something wrong in this world!
omg so happy they are all through to locked in S4 final !!!!!!!! come on kaci u got thisssss🥰
LOVE THAT KACI AND ASH ARE FOING TO THE FINALL
Danny is on top cmon lad
Joyce: "for every 1 person that hates me, 10 people love me" she must have millions of people who love her because man she's getting A LOT of hate.
YESSSS LETS GOOOO THEY ALL MADE ITTT
I'm gonna feel so lost when FootAsylum Locked in is finished
I love George but why did he kill his egg child
i love joyces energy
Kaci ure doing so well , ure my fav keep it up and I hope u make it to the end❤
danny better make it to the end for us pifa fans
Love you Danny you are giving g Eagle posture but love it
If Kaci leaves ITS RIGGED
Routing for you fu skiddy
EARLYYYY ALSO I CAN'T BELIEVE IT IS THE SECOND TO LAST SEASON ALREADY!!!😭😭😭😭😭
Fu was fighting for his life 😂😂 my man was about to pass away
Joyce getting to the final is like Man U winning the world cup
Its coco pops, ITS COCO POPS 🤣, i love joyce
i like how they took out the negative comments after tennessee cried lol
Can footasylum stop showing the boring comments to them, no one cares how kaci looks and how Fu is funny, I’m not saying just show hate comments, just make them more interesting
Joyce is so full of it hope she gets eliminated
Danny tottenham lost 2-1 to wolves mate unlucky
Humpty Dumpty you’re is heavy😂😂😂
I used to hate Danny in sidemen among us, now he’s pretty chill!
All of them singing happy birthday to Niko and Sharky when it’s no where near their birthdays is gold😂😂
Danny kaci or ash leaving is heartbreaking 💔
Danny kaci or ash leaving is heartbreaking 💔
12:00 😂😂😂😂
Hopefully danny wont kill himself when he gets out because of tottenham😂😢
George is class! Wholesome doing it for Danny! Big up George 🎉
Kaci is overrated I’m sorry
Kaci is my favourite, hope she wins
Danny impression of khabib was absolutely hilarious 😂😂😂
Happy birthday sharky and noiko😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
wish joyce was going instead she’s so annoying
Danny has played a dangerous game with the ladies in the house while his girl is watching it all outside lolol
This season is nothing compared to season 2 and 3
They all won immunity
LOVE THEM ALL SOOO MUCH THIS IS THE BEST THING IVE EVER WATCHED!!!✌🏼🎉
Kaci is my favourite she is such an polite girl and has came out her shell so much❤️🐚
My man made them sing happy birthday...
Danny carrying the show
gonna miss 23 locked in, maybe my favourite season yet
This show needs to run long 2 week to short 😂
FU wishing Niko and Sharky a happy birthday is absolutely peak😭😭😭😭
Just one episode where Joyce doesn’t scream like one hyena is all I ask for
dreading the end of it I just love this season to much
We allll love Dannny
this season can’t end actually, i love everyone in it
Danny i have bad news spurs lost to wolves 2-1😂😂
So random Danny but here for Danny an fu zzy
I HOPE KACI WINSSSSSS
Wait so no one left ?
Fu Messing up Niko and Sharky’s birthday was jokes
ash’s care for kaci is beautiful
I like all of them but I hope Danny wins
Danny and George are the absolute goats 😂 luv those guys ❤
Danny acting as if it’s George’s fault 🤣🤣
how joyce is still here is beyond me
Is it me or is Danny the women attractor big up Daniel
petition to bring back hate comments
It’s strange seeing Danny not in a football jersey all the time
6:35 'ur not disabled, u just small' - danny aarons 2023
Please get Joyce out
joyce calling it immature but started it with the ketchup
Joyce i love you so much keep it up danny  your just the flipping goat kacie jeep on worcking hard ash i love your confidence george your just my man and fizzy i like that your being the big brother of the group
If it's an eating challenge then if Danny stays then he wins
Danny is sexy not even strangely fit like ❤
Come on Kaci u can do this xx
Okay Danny isn’t even strangely cute he’s actually sexy cl
Love fu izzy man honestly too funny 😂
I’m not commenting to praise anyone but I just want to let Danny know that Tottenham lost 4-1 to Chelsea
Danny George and Kaci have to make it to the finals I love them so much
Fu saying it was niko and sharky’s birthdays 💀💀
Joyce literally ruined the season
Them singing happy birthday for literally no reason is jokes😂
1:42 You guys already know what im going to say....🤣😂
Joyce is doing to much shaking and saying it’s coco pops
i didnt know ash before this but she us genuinely such a lovely person - so funny but doesnt overdo it, also seems SO nice and i especially love how she looks out for kaci, and i love her relationship w danny too!!!!
Can't wait for Danny to find out about what's happening to Tottenham
If Danny goes I don't think I will watch anymore😂
i didnt know ash before this but she us genuinely such a lovely person - so funny but doesnt overdo it, also seems SO nice and i especially love how she looks out for kaci, and i love her relationship w danny too!!!!!!
Anyone that doesn’t like Joyce is racist
The fuckin bday song has me dying🤣🤣
All of them are the goats but I hope Danny stays his and George’s bromance is the best ❤😂
Icl Footasylum picked such a good cast for this season, first season I’ve watched and definitely wanting kaci to win ❤🫶🏼xxx
Im sure Joyce is a nice person but she is so Jarring. She needs to go
The life of that villa is Joyce❤
Danny was my favorite goin in but then I seen Ash’s BUNDA!!!😜
PRAYING FOR MY GIRL KACI JAY TO WIN ❤
early, i love the lot but kaci stands out ❤
It’s honestly so heartwarming to see all of them come together like a family, I absolutely love this season so much, I love all of them  kaci is one of my favs she’s just so nice and she’s such a kind hearted and the sweetest person and she cares about everyone I really hope she wins ❤️🥰
i hope they all stay but if ash goes kaci will be upset because ash is like her sistaaa from another mothaa😢
Kaci and Fu have the most underrated friendship ever they are so humble and wholesome as people so the friendship does not clash and they just get along like good siblings
I’ve loved kaci since the start of her family’s YouTube and seeing her come out of her shell makes me feel really proud in a way ❤️❤️ xx
GOOOO FU IZZYYYYYY!!!!!
Good to have an eggcellent start to this ep 😊
Danny gives me Michael scott vibes 😂
I hope it is Kaci and Danny
4:15 'hey queens, hey king' SLAYYYYY DANNYS SO RESPECTFUL AND I LOVE ASH SM
does anyone really give a shit about this episode since joyce isnt in bottom 3?
Kaci u got this  ❤❤❤❤
Bad man, George in the building, I hope he wins
Joyce is a invasive species fam. Ten and Star shoulda been here man. Danny, Kaci, George are my finalists fam.
39 mins really? Why these episodes keep going down on time 😂😂
Loving this season, come on kaci
Fu izzy would have left so early tho , considering he has been saved thrice by the team mates is crazy
Danny is so entertaining 😂
GEORGE IS JOKE DRY MAN  NAH I AM JOKING JUST TRYING TO BE MAX KHADAR
As soon as i saw eating challenge I immediately thought Danny was gonna win
only watching for Kaci, love her so much, come on kaci!
kaci better win i stg
Real og bad girl my left ball
Joyce is the star of the season frrr
19:22 did sugarlips just lag 😮
We r all so proud of kaci for coming out of her comfort zone everyone  else deserves to win too but kaci is my winner ❤
This season is really ending 😭😭😭😭
Came here for George leaving here for danny
Joyce plays too much 😂love her
I love you guys xxx
Icl you‘ve let too many people leave early the last couple of episodes haven‘t been the best. And Joyce staying for so long makes it even worse
KACY IS GONNA WIN WE ALL KNOW SHE IS QUEEN ❤!
I love you guys xxx
Absolutely love ALL the housemates , gutted that Danny ash or Kaci have to leave ! But nice to see them have a final challenge together . Can’t wait for the final , and season 5 already ! 😂❤
Danny saying hey queens was absolutely adorable ❤
The best series of them all!
Came here for kaci and stayed for the rest
Is it just me that thinks that joyce needs to calm down and stop with the bullshit ego she has. She shouldn’t have been allowed back in the gaff. Watson had better patter than her
7min gang gang
Letsss go danny
These episodes be getting shorter and shorter wth
Cant believe there is only 1 more episode
I bet Joyce does well on the eating challenge before even watching
how is Joyce still in this? shes so annoying.
The sooner Kaci and Joyce go the better
Joyce so jarring, get her out. Playing the biggest games. Can't believe she's in the final
The fact joyce made it to the final day..
Soo good
georges brother is so proud on the reaction
Love Danny sm he better win
sooooo the immunity challenges were pointless LMAO
kaci will forever be my winner💓💓
Kaci deserves the win
i love how fu talks about kaci....thats lil sis fr
danny is the top g
It’s so heartwarming to see all of them come together like a family. I love this season 💗
Not even one minute and I‘ve had enough of Joyce
I love Kaci Mj and ash you girls are all amazing I’m rooting for everyone of you🤍🤍🤍🤍
joyce is sp funny😂😂
THE GOLDEN TRIO YES KACI HAS COME OUt OF HER SHELL SO MUCH I JUST LOVE SHES MY FaV
kaci is so down to earth ❤
Joyce got so paranoid last episode to the point the made the whole other gender her enemy
if dany gets eliminated its rigged
Spoilers: Ash and Kaci both leave this episode
Only39 minutes is criminal
ash's makeup is always looking so goos😍
I don't want anyone to leaveeeee 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Danny or Kaci to win
When you realize that there’s only one more episode left and no more of waiting for 7:00 pm sharp every night 😢💔
came for danny here to watch everyone
This has to be the best series ever 💯
Love u guys ❤❤
AHHH I'M SO SCARED 😨😨😨😭😭😭😭
On god this the best season! Danny got this one in the bag LIGHT WORK! 💪🏽
It's a shame knowing two of Danny, Kaci and Ash are going when they're literally my 3 favourite remaining housemates
2:02 danny telling his story like that was class
Nothing infuriated me more then Joyce making it to the final
u lot messed up doing 3 immunity cahllenges yday bcus the best 3 were the only ones w no immunity:(
Cmon Kaci your doing so well
Joyce is jarring asf 💀💀
Honestly want Joyce to go she’s so jarring it’s giving the worst vibes ever out of all series
Loving kaci! All the girls are actually amazing but kaci is so pretty and probably the best! ❤️
Danny and George the best duo
“Someone threw a pillow at fu Izzy but I don’t know who it was” 😂😂😂😂
This is a WILD SHOW loving the it have to say kaci is my fave x

Kaci is so slay who does not love her vomiting for her to win also this year looked in is better then ever :)))))))))
Danny I’m gonna touch you
Kaci is by far my favourite person in season 4. Win it for us !!
Please let Kaci know from me, she had influenced me into buying some things from the new drop of Dès vu🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍
I love locked in so much especially with George and Danny dynamic duo love it
The ending of this series will be a sad day fr
Ever since Joyce voted out Tennessee I stopped liking her
Danny be carrying this season ngl
