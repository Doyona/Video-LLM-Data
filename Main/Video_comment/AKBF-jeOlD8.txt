it’s sad how life just beats people down to this point like for real it’s hard you did well don’t worry
Time waster he is not leaving his camera man just left
It’s sad that Chris left a while ago lol however can we take a minute to talk about how cute all those doggies are just popping up next to you… I’m sorry but I’m listening to you but I’m also watching what the doggies are doing behind you lol there’s one that gets stuck behind you for quite some time .. lol I was like did the other one just decide to take a nap behind youu or did he like disappear 😂
Good luck  jeffre we love you 😘
I have been on and off with you... you have grown so much from so many situations. I am glad I have come across this video also. I appreciate this video so much;. You are so real and it is so sweet for you to make this video about him.
Hair and makeup is bomb Jeffree!!!

اخخييييييييييييي
🤡🙈
Funny how he said he only does vids like this before announcing new merch, but not this vid, then did it at the end! I just think his employees are trying to get away from him asap
I wish u were not snobby. U have not been a nice person. Im not trying to send hate. Please respect people. Dont focus on hate and drama. Focus on ur self. Dont fake it. U really need qctually look into ur self and fucus on ur childhood. Dont post any of it on here. I would wrather feel pain than go into a dark place where i cant come back
I just read comment section so now I know
Also hello future me (ill look for this comment 5 years later if I remember) ill  probably forget tomorrow
Who even cares
Lmao
Is you o is you not …
This is the biggest clickbait ever
Uncle Jeff might have done things wrong, but for a person this famous it's nice to say thanks to his employees.
Bruh who’s here from newest Chris is back vudeo
I love watching ur videos Jeffree! You are just so real and transparent! You have really helped me navigate my life changes! Ur videos are like therapy for me as well as laughter, tears, etc. Ur so much more than just make up! Keep bossin'!!!
I’m loving that hair style it’s super cute
Is no one going to talk about how he spelt 'everyone' wrong in the description?
Clearly last comment ij left just now removed in live time , fuck YouTube shit nothing gas changed
Who the fuck is Chris?
Hi Jeffree star Brother
Thats how you know I need glasses I thought he had hair curlers in lol
God bless you Jeffrey
Maybe it’s time to give Andrew a call👀
Bye old lady who cares.. Next
First time watching your video
His pants must be on Fire. Lier lier that why all the plastic ass shots. Gap be wide. 🐓🍭🤡
Gross
😂😂😂
"I've never done this before"  Jefree star talking about being actually nice and owning up to his actions
Roflcopter at this clickbait s#!?
Such ridiculous things
Funny how after JS has been SO.....I don't wanna say problematic as that's not serious enough...but let's say VERY problematic, that in just over a year his boyfriend left him, assistant left him and now his cameraman has left him. The only one that's stuck around is the wig guy. Did we ever see Nathan, Maddie or Christian say disgusting things to another human being about their weight, skin, etc? Nope! Did we see Jay do that? Oh! Yes we did! The decent people who've been seen/heard on camera are leaving and the trash is staying. Am I surprised? Absolutely not. Am I shocked how long it took for JS's mask to drop and them to leave? 100%. Am I a former fan taking the Mick outta the way JS speaks right now? You bet I am!  Either go silent and disappear in to the background so we never have to see or hear about any of your vile behaviour or fakery again OR get your bony behind on camera and be HONEST rather than manipulative! #sooverit
What a fkin disgrace to humanity
I love youuuu so much gurrrrl ❤️❤️❤️❤️😍❤️😍🥰❤️🥰😘
Trying to watch you but that tiny dog is stealing the spotlight LOL so adorable but such a pain in the butt to his siblings LOL she/he just wants to wrestle and play. So cute!! And yea I need to be super careful with camera people. Everyone should be careful with that but with you it is next level careful.
Yo baby yo
who else was watching the dogs?
People don’t get it…JSC is huge as is JS himself…his empire takes a village to run and the work schedule probably has little free time penciled in. Nobody could do that level of work long-term. You can’t have babies when you’re working 24/7. You do not have the time to properly tend to your personal relationships and family. Chris and Maddie seemed to love working for JS and their decisions to leave were probably very difficult…but my guess is they just want to take a long and long overdo nap. Lol!💗
I was really trying to listen to what Jeffree was saying but the puppies! 😂 they are too cute!
FOR GOD SO LOVED THE WORLD, THAT HE GAVE HIS ONLY BEGOTTEN SON OF GOD JESUS CHRIST, WHOEVER BELIEVES IN HIM SHALL NOT PERISH, BUT HAVE  EVERLASTING LIFE IN HEAVEN FOREVER AND EVER. John 3:16 Bible....THE RAINBOW THRONE OF SON OF GOD JESUS CHRIST AND THE TREE OF LIFE, Revelations 4 and Revelations 22 Bible. And whoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death. Revelations 20 bible.... I SAW A NEW HEAVEN AND A NEW EARTH, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away. Also there was no more sea. 2 Then I, John, saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. 3 And I heard a loud voice from heaven saying, “Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and He will dwell with them, and they shall be His people. God Himself will be with them and be their God. 4 And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes; there shall be no more death, nor sorrow, nor crying. There shall be no more pain, for the former things have passed away.” 5 Then He who sat on the throne said, “Behold, I make all things new.” And He said to me, “Write, for these words are true and faithful.”  6 And He said to me, “It is done! I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End. I will give of the fountain of the water of life freely to him who thirsts. 7 He who overcomes shall inherit all things, and I will be his God and he shall be My son. 8 But the cowardly, unbelieving, abominable, murderers, sexually immoral, sorcerers, idolaters, and all liars shall have their part in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone, which is the second death.”REVELATIONS 21 BIBLE.

When you are so famous you can make a video in your dressing gown and still hit #1 on trending...

It would be a dream to film for Jeffrey star ❤️
Bye Chris!
The one black dog staring at the couch is scaring me haha
Ugh finally
Is he trans
Jeffree, you're NEVER saying goodbye to all of us unless you're a liar.
I sure would’ve enjoyed working for him so I could save my home. I’m terrified of becoming homeless.
This is girl or boy ?
Bruh u is weird
Ok but like he looks like Ariana Grande
I'm having more fun watching those 4 bundles of cuties playing on the couch. ❤️
finally they're gone, *checks their feed* not surprised
😂 I pee with the door open hunny, never too much info 😂😂
Just hire me to come help you with the fur babies they are adorable 🥰 😱 🥰
I like how he just sits on those miniature cats, without looking or worrying. They must be foreign, their meows are different!
This is the first video I’ve ever seen of yours and wasn’t sure how I stumbled on it ❤️but your an amazing person!  I’m six hrs from casper I go there every once in a while I hope your ranch and family does well. And best of luck with rebuilding  your team.

Hello🐱🐺
Bro I thought this was girl when I first saw the channel 🤣🤣 wait are u
Who cares, whopper news....
Nobody is talking about Maddie in the comments, so FYI his personal assistant Maddie has also left along with Chris the camera man
I can be you personal assistant…..jk but really too bad I am in tx and just turned 18
He looks stunning omg
Is this a man or a woman?
I want to give you a big hug right know 🥺 just ine day at the time 😘
Hi Jeffree I know you don't know me...I send message to you because I am trying to ask help from you...hoping for your help..... please Jeffree IAM from Philippines
Bye Christian & Maddie! Good luck with all of your future endeavors!
Your going to be OK. Like you said life changes. Nothing but positive thoughts and energy
Is this a gay person
💋
I just love the dogs in the background just like they're really there to support their mom. Aww sweet
Fabulous video,.aroma from heaven
If I just had a dollar for every time he says “it’s crazy”…..
Jeffree you look so beautiful with your new hair look girl 💕😘
I dont necessarily think jeffrey star is a great person but i feel like the hatred he receives is kind of unnecessary.
Eeewww!!!
Let me be your camera man I’ll get trained and come work 💯
don't waste 12 minutes of your life, he is NOT LEAVING YOUTUBE, we say good bye to his camera man 😓🥱😴
Bois we got em
People are literally homeless cause of COVID, and here’s Jeffree acting like his whole life is falling apart cause of a camera man. SMH.
TOSSER
LMFAO THE 52k DISLIKES BYE- they prob are from the people who watched the whole ass video just to find out his camera man is leaving 💀
great clickbait.
Shit. I will relocate in a heartbeat.
How does one apply for these “personal assistant” positions? Seriously. Does anyone knw any inside info on that?
I’m not happy with my step daddy Steve
"2020" was hard? You don't say? I mean, let's keep it in perspective - yeah, you suffered, in a mansion, with money in the bank, and food/TP/lysol stocked up. We also had a civil rights movement- against racists.  Hmm, wonder why I mentioned that?  I'm just crazy, I know. But hey, it was hard for Jeffrey,  lol.
I don't understand why is this so hard for me to watch like I'm not saying goodbye to anybody, he is..so why is this so hard ?????? 😭😭😭
2:17 🐶😹😹
There was 10k & now 51k dislikes
Praying this is the last goodbye.  So passé and is now annoying.  Just sucks the life out of everyone he knows.
My dude you are a scary man, person, thing - and you just took 11 mins of my life that I will never get back - also I'm glad your precious camera man left you - that was one of smartest descions he's made so far
JEFFREE should go to space with Jeff Bezos and never return
His Cameraman is leaving.....it took him that long to address that You're welcome btw.
You are amazing. New and wonderful friends and people will come into your life but it is sad and hard when people we love travel a divergent path to the one we take and it takes them away in a different direction. I feel sad to think of all the wonderful special people I loved and still love who have joined my journey along the way and are now on a different journey. Love your videos, Jeffree. PS: Would love to be your PA but alas I live in the UK ;) xx
Love the wig
gg cameraman
Trust ppl is damage,but you should choose one
Who is she/he? OMG what's happening here. Such a cheap world.
Y’all love clickbait
What about me
Proud of you.
✌🤙🤙🤙
Is he gay?
FOR GOD SO LOVED THE WORLD, THAT HE GAVE HIS SON OF GOD JESUS CHRIST,   WHOSOEVER BELIEVETH IN HIM SHALL NOT PERISH, BUT HAVE  EVERLASTING LIFE IN HEAVEN FOREVER AND EVER. JOHN 3:16 BIBLE.....        THE RAINBOW THRONE OF SON OF GOD JESUS CHRIST AND THE TREE OF LIFE Revelations 4 and Revelations 22 Bible.   1After these things I looked, and behold, a door standing open in heaven. And the first voice which I heard was like a trumpet speaking with me, saying, “Come up here, and I will show you things which must take place after this.” 2Immediately I was in the Spirit; and behold, a throne set in heaven, and One sat on the throne. 3And He who sat there was like a jasper and a sardius stone in appearance; and there was a rainbow around the throne, in appearance  like an emerald.    4Around the throne were twenty-four thrones, and on the thrones I saw twenty-four elders sitting, clothed in white robes; and they had crowns of gold on their heads. 5And from the throne proceeded lightnings,  thunderings, and voices. Seven lamps of fire were burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God. 6Before the throne there was a sea of glass, like crystal. And in the midst of the throne, and around the throne, were four living creatures full of eyes in front and in back. 7The first living creature was like a lion, the second living creature like a calf, the third living creature had a face like a man, and the fourth living  creature was like a flying eagle.   8The four living creatures, each having six wings, were full of eyes around and within. And they do not rest day or night, saying:...... “Holy, holy, holy,.. Lord God Almighty, Who was and is and is to come!” 9Whenever  the living creatures give glory and honor and thanks to Him who sits on the throne, who lives forever and ever, 10the twenty-four elders fall down before Him who sits on the throne and worship Him who lives forever and ever, and cast their crowns before the throne, saying: 11“You are worthy, O Lord, To receive glory and honor and power; For You created all things, And by Your will they exist and were created..

Saying goodbye is very hard but it opens doors for those you love. I hope and pray you find someone you can trust because we know how hard that can be nowadays. When the times right it will feel right. I wish nothing but the best for you Jeffree. You are a star and light will always find you ⭐💗💫

I love you Jeffrey id be a great assistant i have lived you for years and would devote my life wyoming LA i dont care i got you .
I love you Jeffree and it really sucks that there are Human's out there that aren't happy unless they are causing problems! I will always love you and your makeup!!
didnt even make it through the ad, thank you guys in the comments.
I am no one special, but working for you would be a dream!! I am inspired by you so often! Congratulations to both of your friends/fam members for chasing after their own dreams!
"My little ones hear me, my Holy Mother awaits you with the greatest love there is, Her beautiful arms received my bloodless body descending from the cross, seek refuge in her Immaculate Heart, so when your time comes, my Holy Mother will drive away the demons, whom will try to drag you down in those last moments. Why would you think i am unfair, since i  am the Perfect Justice?. Those who crucified me, intend to sit around my table along with my friends, them who instead of going to parties, guarded themselves accompanying me,  despite doing it poorly, gave me their love, time,thoughts, and kneel down before my Holy Cross. Meanwhile you eat, drink, and laugh at them. Do you believe to be fair if i granted  you the same fate as my sheep?. Dont fool yourselves, surprise will be terrible with bone crunching and teeth grinding. Ill tell you this now, so you can still repent and fix  your ways. Since i am the infinite mercy for those who do regret their bad doing and return to my loving arms. But, you have to do it right now because ive said it; theres no time. Eternity opens up and the time of men wich, is the time of gentiles comes to an end. Just as with my beloved Israel. invoke my Mother, invoke my father Saint Joseph.   -Jesus
"My death on the cross was gruesome, but i accepted it for love, so you could be saved. However, you must wish to be saved, must believe, must read my Holy Word. If you igonre it, how are you going to find the path?. No one loves more than who gives his life for his friends!. I asked your frienship by delivering to crucification and, even that doesnt seem to convince you.   -Jesus
"Wicked generation, you have crucified me again, as if the first time was not enough. Its like youre saying; Lord Jesus, stay crucified, while we get satisfied from sinning, but  dont worry we'll repent on our very death bed. Youre blatant cynical. I know even your deepest thoughts, and i know you think this way. Theres no worst impudence. Your souls will shout; Jesus,jesus!. I tell you now, if you didnt meet me on Earth, I wont meet you in Heaven. If i gave you the same reward i have prepared for those who did  humilliate before me, served , joined and loved me. Wouldn't that be unfair to them?. You crucify me again and those who carry my cross, I dont see anything else from you besides the grotesque, mocking laughter at my name and all that has to do with me.   -Jesus
"Third fall, this fall is the hardest, the most painful and, ive said it; it was due to this terrible wicked generation, that even men themselves would never have imagined,  maintaining your evil ways and corruption, reaching a heinous scale. Where do you intended to get following this road?, do you really think the cliff to hell falls into heaven?. My little ones, dont get frightened hearing my holy words, they need to be heard as a testimoy of my anger towards this wicked generation and children molesters, wich make them  suffer even in my own Churh. Theres no other falling, you submerged generation in the mud of sin, ive said it, youre this last fall.   -Jesus
"Wicked generation who forgot about your God, theres nothing else in your minds besides pleasure,eating,drinking and filling up of concupiscence. Now that we are at the end of a long era, you do nothing else than part from this life with even more sin. How do you expect to be saved, if theres no effort to stretch your hand so, i Jesus Christ can grab it and pull you out of the abyss, where you are falling rapidly"
The Prince Collaboration by Urban Decay please review it!
I'm so, so, sorry that two of your mansions best employees will be leaving you. What i'm more sorry about is the 11 minutes ppl wasted watching this video.

“We’re saying goodbye to a lot of things in this video” The a lot of think he’s saying goodbye to is the air he’s breathing and his camera man ;-;
I’m so sorry about your friend but I’m happy your not saying goodbye I was near crying 😭 love ya and ya rock 💖
I'm a Paramedic and photographer my wife is a barber and cosmetologist and we have a well traveled  adopted daughter we will come be your family!
You know it's nice that he's being considerate and acknowledging his staff hard work and not saying he did it all him self. I love how he thanks the people around him even when he doesn't need to. 💜 To many people want to take all the credit that others worked for. I hope more people follow his kind of path. Yes he hasn't always been perfect, but no one is. And yet he still does his best.   Love you Jeffery Star. Your an inspiration 💜
Am really enjoying watching his/her puppies playing😂😂
I don't know if I should say it here on this video but can you guys just check my shorts and only like the video and subscribe to my channel if you like them ❤️
Binod
Im just curious, no offense. How can 16 milion pepole be subscribed to this guy or a girl. To me it just feels disgusting.
WE REMEMBER we don't forget manipulative poisonus lies in the Tati-James Charles drama ...
How he the richest Bill Gates is on this platform
Why are y’all trying to cancel Jeffrey like literally what else did he do I know what happened but still like Jeffrey I think it’s sincere stop like trying to kick him off the boat already like he’s continue and he’s moving on y’all bitches or not so shut the fuck up and let him live a life😡
I am so sorry for your loss Jeffree.  I couldn't imagine losing my camera man 😔✊🏻
Bye
A team of poms!!! 💖💖💖 Great dogs!!! 🐶🐶🐶
So I looked up on Google who the richest YouTuber is and this shit showed up. Just shows how messed up the world is now
his face is very dull
Love you... Stay strong😘 From🇮🇳
Narcissism is a terrible illness
Jef doesn't get many views anymore 👀
Guys , can I ask you ?  This is normal man or no ? Are he gay or what?
Lol bye sexy
Why do people watch you anymore
Jeffree would rock a illumi cosplay 💀
Such A Calm Enviroment From The Camera View. The Dogs Just Playin' And Chillin' Is Too Cute Too. 😄
Wish the lying would stop to
I'm new is this a boy or a girl
I hope he rots in hell he doesn’t deserve everything he has he’s nasty
Awwww hate it when good energy leaves 😢 sending lots of luck on your search!
How in the fuck is this man worth 200mil? 😂😂😂
I hope his makeup is still going to be in stores. i want his entire collection,every piece of it. HE,S so F**king amazing!!!!! I dont give a fuck what antone says !!!!!!!!!!!
Hire meeee
You should be leaving Youtube for hell's sake! Your toxicity is just too much!
Hey ! You better stick around okay !! We love you so much!
he's not leaving YouTube his camera man is leaving your welcome Edit: just noticed someone named "emily romero" copied my comment as if it was a joke. Pls know that this is the original comment😘
Can you do my Make up
thanks to the comments, i will not be watching this video
What happened to reality
I love this whole comment section 😂
Zzzzzzzzzz
Who else went back to the beginning of the video just to watch Donatella
Why don’t you ask your bf: SHANE
Lmao why does everyone keep doing the weird thing when they start recording before they put the camera on the tripod it’s so odd
Trust Jesus today,  time's about up.  1 Corinthians 15:3-4  Christ died for our sins  according to the scriptures, was buried and rose again the third day according to the scriptures.  Romans 10:9-10 ⁹ that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved. ¹⁰For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.  Call on Jesus today FYI  (when Millions of people vanish,, Jesus took us Christians home to protect us from the Trib,  it wasn't the aliens they are pushing (demonic manifestation) to explain away the rapture to deceive the left behind unbelievers
you talk too much without saying anything.
Funny how you said in your fake "apology" video that you've never committed a crime BECAUSE YOU DID AT MY HOUSE YA LIAR
nice.
Sending thoughts and prayers your way  ! That is a lot of change to have to absorb after the dumpster fire of a year that 2020 was ! I know you will find new people to fill their shoes and that you will grow to love them just as much and work together just as well . It just takes time to find that fit !
We may dislike him but if he wasn't there it would kinda be boring without his drama 🎭
I know this is a bad time to say this on this video but why is Jeffrey always so glamorous and his house is so glamorous and like I literally wanna live his life LMAOOO 😍😍😍😍😍  Edit: why are people being so insensitive in the comments. The cameraman has literally been working for Jeffrey for 5 1/2 years... they probably have a very strong relationship by now. It’s not about him filming himself it’s about a relationship that he had with somebody and has been in his life everysingle day for a long time, that is now coming to an end. Like damn.
I really hope everything is ok with you please give us an update soon. So we know you are ok.
I GOTTT SCARED ?$#*#^($^@
We should have guessed the cameraman judging by the intro with him spending a lot of time fiddling with the camera
_my camera man is leaving, so let me be hyperbolic about how to NOT use a camera... even tho I use one everyday for Snapchat and Instagram_
🤮
Here from Meatcanyon
We will be miss you so much
ehhhh
Lucky cameraman
you are so disgusting
Click bait much.
Wtf is your gender
Did I touch a death note? Because I can see a shinigami.
You probably already found a new personal assistant and a cameraman but... Regarding what you said about job listings... Wouldn't it be great to change someone else's life by handpicking them from the other side of the world purely for their talents and competency? I mean... I'm from Turkey and I have been working as a research assistant in universities :) Of course, it is not the same but I think I could handle the job very well and I'm a scorpio, your secrets would be buried with me when I die someday, haha :D We wouldn't have trust issues! PS: I can cook, clean, draw/paint, write, knit... I have my BA in visual communication design & MA in new media & communication management. I have (little) experience as a designer too! Damn, I hope I get to be paid in dollars or euros someday. Fingers crossed!
Did anyone else just zone out Jeffrey and focus on the Pom poms? Lol
ඞ
i don't know why but to those people watching his vlog , my gosh you're so bored , funny , and strong  and  blind you look at the outside part of this person but not the inside.
You are so be..🚫 sorry but 🤢🙈🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
My dearest with doors closing is only opportunity for doors opening. Thanks for being you. I pray an assistant will come your way soon as special as last and as special as you are they will be fortress to you in the crazy world we I’ve in . 🙏🏻🙏🏻💖💖😎

HOW IS THIS GUY FAMOUS??? PLS STOP EW
Jeffree is such a funny troll 😉 living for the title
You look like a e-girl in man in fersion
Let’s thank the comments for saving us from having to watch this video
Sometimes I feel bad for Jeffree because he’s so strong after so many comments so many shts happen in his life. At the end of the day he’s still a human, he still have his own problems personally and I can feel that he’s upset and depressed off camera. I mean me as a nobody in life had gone through sht, so he definitely had gone through much worse. Really amazed that he stood up with his own two feet and kept fighting until these days!
Perfect at 1.5x lmfao
Jeffree I'll come and film you 😁 i mean I'm NZ born live in Sydney Australia very honest maybe a bit too honest lol i reakon we would get along great, i mean it would be exciting to try something so different life's to short 💯 maybe I'm just dreaming but hayy if you don't put positive thoughts out there then dammm 😂 I'm alone in this world and would extremely love a chance to become myself again haha p.s 420 friendly 😘 hopefully you read this xxxx
I always liked Chris the camera man
People stop the hate... go on with your lives... Don’t wish bad stuff on people...
The camera man finally escaped good for him
🌛🌕🌜
I've watched your videos since you started and and have loved pretty much all of them. I see all these rude comments on this video and I dont understand why people gotta be so mean, but if you need a new assistant I got you. I dont mind traveling lol 😆
Hi Jeffrey I have a friend he’s a photographer if interested please let me know thanks.......
Wtf is this mess....a guy dressed up and acting like a woman....wtf is this shit? Why is this allowed on youtube? Why are kids allowed to watch this? Why was this on my recommended???????? Why did I click on it????? I paused this shit and posted this now I'm gone. And I oop
Car crash
How do I apply for personal assistant?
Where can I apply to be your personal assistant? Facebook DM me Jefreee
Love your makeup, but what a fucking click bait video. NO ONE CARES ABOUT YOUR CAMERA PERSON lmao Like literally nobody. How dramatic like it was YOU. Seriously wtf.
He’s only been on YouTube since 2015???
IF I DIDNT READ THE TOP COMMENT I WOULD BE IN SADNESS DAMN SMH😃😃😃😃😭🧟‍♀️🧟‍♀️🧟‍♀️🧟‍♀️
U should add guinea pigs to your mix of pets
kk
Damn. I was really hoping YT would finally be rid of this asshole.
Was hoping he left... but nope! His cameramen.
Luv ya Jeffreee :) your a Star !!
Dang... He is reaching hard for views with that click-bait thumbnail. He only cares about himself it’s called  narcissism.
I hope everything falls into place for you! 🧡❤💜🧡❤💜

I feel bad for the camera man that had to be with Jeff for years
"Omg quarantine has been so hard for me, I had to buy another multimillion dollar house 🥺 I had to stay inside my mansion with an indoor cinema and 3 pools in my Gucci and Versace guys its so hard being me #depressed😪"
OMGosh I just rewatched this. Change is crazy but it’s gonna be nice to settle things out again!!!
Ight- but the hair is cool tho.  The rest of the video- Pointless.
I am so sorry you have to say good bye to Dear friends... I would die to be your assistant, but unfortunately I am very very far away... Sending you my love, Jeffree ❤️
Everyone jumping ship. Finally something that makes sense.
Ya know..... regardless of how extra he may be sometimes.... change is hard.  When you're used to having someone around and then they're not it takes a minute to adjust.  Just cause your sitting alone in a big ass million dollar mansion doesn't make it any less lonely. 😔
All the ppl in the comments with negative things to say are heartless and salty af. If you guys dont like Jeffree then GTFO. Not only was Chris his camera man but like Jeffree said he was a friend and they spent so much time together. Its hard to say bye to ppl that you have been close to for so long. 💋💋💖💖💖💕💕 Love you Jeffree, we will miss you Chris!
I LOVE YOU, JEFFREESTARR.
Ugh, I thought he was finally leaving
Hi
Okay but his hair tho
nobody likes you
Why is everyone only mentioning Christmas, he mentioned his personal assistant Maddie too
the car crash might knock some sense into him
His cameraman left that’s all nothing really bad happened
what happened with maddie?
lol no one wants to be associated with him anymore
https://youtu.be/gIaXIZv9O84
Do people still support him? Tf
i always love u #Jeff 😘
Stop Huffing and puffing so much
I will be your camera man
Are you following Kanye in Wyoming.
Welcome to Casper Jeffrey!! My wife and I are new to Casper as well and loving it!! Thoughts and prayers for a speedy recovery from your recent crash!!
Meh, the video is actually better then most because you get to watch the dogs tussle around in the background unedited 💙
I can’t be the only one who was focusing on the dogs the whole beginning lol
Damn yall are ruthless in the comments. Jeffree you need a moderator lmao
man's predicted his death
How is he not canceled?  Toxic seriously can’t help but cringe
How is it that I'm 35 and in Bakersfield California 1hr away from LA got the vaccine 2 weeks after it came out
So glad I read the comments first lmao. If holding a camera by yourself is too much, you may as well just leave too. 👌
Bye Chris
Does anyone really need a cameraman these days. Can use a tripod. Also strange that EVERYONE'S moving on to the "next chapter" of their lives!
i have to check up on him but i paused during the ad so hopefully he won’t get my money lol
yes !!!
Just imagine being so passive aggressive and jealous that you really believe rich people don't have personal problems too. These comments are catty and immature.
what a sad pathetic shell of a human
I was gunna say, better than an apology video, but the camera man is only leaving.. damn.
God you such a shameless clout chaser Jeffree! 🤣
He did all that just to hit the 10 minute mark, this coulda been a tweet 🤣
we got the same robe
Buy ethereum before the price skyrockets
Sorry to hear that Jeffree, but let's be for real here girl those buns look thicker then slider buns.
Alright morgz, chill.
So he/she is dating K West now?
You need me Jeffrey. I am 42 and from the cornfields in Indiana. I am the most trustworthy person and I will pack up now and head your way.

Disappointed
I love you Jeffree...you got this shit girl!! 💗💗💗💗💗
Anyone else distracted by the cute balls of fluff playing UFC on the couch?
Maybe do a contest on YT to find a new videographer? 🎥
It's sad when people you've known for so long leave, if I ever got famous I would get super depressed that an assistant or whoever is leaving.   Ps can I fill out for a job? Plz
TOTAL CLICK BAIT! Didn’t finish it.

Some of these comments piss me off leave him be he’s upset Christian was a big part of his life he’s done some really bad things in the past I get that but at the end of the day he is still human and made mistakes like we all do he has learnt from his mistakes that’s the main thing ❤️
7:27 thank me later 😝
Jeffery, stop repeating your dumb ass redoric
please bring back bullying so kids dont end up like this
Speaking of your soul! Are you aware of the days we're living in? The return of Jesus Christ may be on the horizon and men who dress like women and much much worse encourage other young men to do so needs to really begin to question where they will spend eternity. No judgement, just food for thought.
dang, I got excited..
God the whole James Charles case reminded me of this dude and honestly... how is this guy not deplatformed?? Like I’m not one for cancel culture but honey. If Shane is off the internet you should too you aren’t any more innocent than he is uwu get off the internet and actually think about your actions for once UwU

Why is everyone losing their camera men?

I love you Jeffree please stay strong . You do so much amazing things including your cosmetics . These past 2 years have been hard for both of us . I know how you feel . I lost a lot of people and things in my life that I didn't expect to but that is how life is. ❤❤❤
I think it’s sweet. And I don’t know why y’all getting mad at him being upset. Of course he’ll be upset when friends leaves his team, especially being apart of his everyday life.
Wish he was leaving yt
WTF clickbait 🤬
Lots of love from Norway 😘😘😘 love u
I can’t take him seriously... I think you know why
Still the worst human being on youtube

Congratulations @Jeffreestar Wish you the best.. You got this!
you look absolutely STUNNING jeffree. really love your makeup and whole vibe here! Honestly, GORGEOUS. That being said, Im so sorry that Chris and your girl Maddie(sp?) are moving to the next chapter of their life, but i am sure you are happy for them and yall can still support eachother and grow your friendship!  These are huge personal changes, but you can figure it out. You always do XOXO
Dont get the vaccine. It kills people and theres nothing wrong with living a normal life Tf cant wait to get chipped or what?
Meanwhile the dogs are rearranging the blanket 😂
You are men bru

I still can’t get this out of my head when trying to rationalize this fanbase: https://youtu.be/RHH0zDRTwEg By H3H3
Don’t come back
🙄 🙄🙄
His camera man left there
Why are haters over here watching him?  You guys are ridiculous.  Grow the hell up
This dude is really fake
Why does all his serious videos have him in a bathrobe-
TL/DW? is it clickbait or actually worth watching? lol
It’s honestly really hard to take you serious
God just shut up
So this is a 10min video about his cameraman leaving? The man could have just tweeted it and everyone would know aswell. No details needed
Basically Chris (cameraman) is moving on because of
Ok but why do you look constipated in the thumbnail 🗿
Y’all are mean asf. It’s amazing how so many of y’all claim to not like a person but here you are watching their videos.. cause I could never. Just admit you’re a fan 🙄
What camera do you use???  I love it😇
Note to self: Read the comments first.  ...if this could've been an email were an 11 minute YouTube video...
Damn I really thought he had a reality check
when you work for a call center so you string out the message
I knew it wud be nothing, I know wen you tubers put titles like this 9out of ten times its bull💩
I PRAY for you.  Go well and 2021 is gonna be a GREAT year for you, Jeffree.  :)
THESE COMMENTS ARE FUCKING KILLINGGGG ME😭😭😭
Don't even try to play like covid has affected you financially, it's pathetic.
Also I meant to ask if you can do reviews for milk? Or vegan or cruelty free make up? Like pacifica? Also Fenty came out with something !
I’m here for you! You got this ! I miss your reviews !
Elequantly spoken. You will be missed.
He is not leaving Youtube his camera man is leaving. I will save 11 mins of your life. Youbre welcome

I'm kind of sad about how much negativity there is on this video. Regardless of what the reason may be.

Jeffrey: iM lEaVinG YOuTubE  of course he is flexing his million dollar mansion while not even talking about himself he’s not leaving YouTube guys he’s not done with tHe tEa and DraMa it’s just his camera guy leaving. Jeez he really has to clickbait every time
he mentioned the shane series. am i the only one wondering if he cut ties with ahane or not after the drama happened
Oᴏ
You are NOT leaving anywhere. We cant lose the only proof aliens exist.
did he really just clickbait all of us lol
Every Asian thinking the same thing - THE NEW HOUSE HAS BAD JUJU. Put it on eBay.
Love you Jeffrey, keep strong!
I made it to the bitter end....I know that you will continue to kill it and I know that you will prevail. Ignore the haters and live your life by your on standards.
'Pride comes before a fall'
Clown
So glad he’s not leaving ❤️❤️❤️❤️
do more vlogs..
stop getting my hopes up jaundice
where do i apply to be a personal assistant
NOT SOME OF Y'ALL TRYING TO UNCANCELL HIM DID U FORGET ALL HE HAS DONE FOR THE PAST 11 YEARS ? PLEASE.
Thank you for sharing! You are a good person and when watching a video a like this it is like listening to a friend even though you don't know me. :) All will be good Jeffree! You have come such a long way and you will manage just fine and even though your videos would be recorded with nothing more than a selfie-cam, I'd still be watching. :)
WHY DID YOU POP UP 😭🤞 PLEASE I WAS SEARCHING JOEY MILLS
He's just sharing his feelings. If you don't like it, go then.
So drama. Jesus no one cares about that. Stop deep breathing
i need more jeffree!!!
WHAT A GOOD WAY TO GET MORE VIEWS😀😀😀
Why are people tripping? This IIIISSS his channel he literally said no tea and that hair is everything and worth watching the whole vid! Hes cheering his friends on that's awesome!!! Ily jeffree!! Best wishes babe❤❤❤❤❤❤
Youre dogs 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰❤❤❤❤❤❤ hope Chris is doing well!! Ily Jeffree
I would literally lick the bottom of the dog's poop bags while I book my flight to Wyoming to work for Jeffree.
My dear JS, I understand how you feel, I know changes are really hard to accept when they arrive, but then you get used to them, it’s not easy but life always surprises us.
Did anyone else think he was gonna say his camera man DIED like oh my god hahahaha what is this
Heyy my name is Andrea and I am only 20 but If I ever had the chance to assist you I would give my 100% because I feel like you are a caring and sweet human being! Leaving all the drama on the side you seem like a genuine person that is just trying to do the same thing as everyone one else. Just trying to live every day the best way you can. There will be ups and downs but I have seen that you have a great spirit of confronting these conflicts and accepting them as a lesson learned! Have a great day! I loveeee you and keep being who you are!!!❤❤❤
U got this for real! Step back and breathe gather your thoughts then come back😀
His wig- 💀🤚
The vibe of the way Jeffree filmed this is sooo personal. I love it!
This channel and this person is a complete trait wreck
I love how all the top comments are taking the piss lmao
Shane Dawson looking for a new job? 👀
Muah gurl! Hang in.
The puppy being mutilated in the background 😅🤭🤔 that dog legit eating it out .
Please do
Best of luck and power to you J
I came from dark place😂😂😂😂😂😂 still iconic
Y'all. He's earned his fame. He's worked for it. He isn't losing his employees he's losing his close friends and that sucks. If y'all are just going to dis on him then leave. No one is forcing you to watch.
Find someone from Wyoming. Sure we're small town but we're not crazy like LA lol.
So when are you leaving
Has Nathan left him or am I not caught up
Is Shane ok he hasn't made a vide in 9 months
Wow not having a camera man, that’s so sad and relatable 😔😔😔
I’m here when do I start 🌚
Stop why does the intro look so funny to me
You cannot leave the end. OK I'll stop being selfish do what's right for you and keep being you❤
im kind of astounded at the overwhelming lack of empathy in the comments.  christian was a v important part of jeffree's life and jeffree took the time to open up about separating from that, and not making as many videos because of that.  yet people are so selfish and shallow that they treat it as a punch line in the comments.  that's amazing.  imagine losing a good friend that's been an important part of your life for the past 5 years.  all of you trolling or making fun of his message (with limited spelling and intelligence) can go fk yourselves, actually.  no one's forcing you to watch.  no one's forcing you to buy his makeup.  no one's holding you at gunpoint to fangay over every waking minute of his youtube content.  so don't.  it's so interesting that people troll/ridicule (even try to cancel) him when all the while they are building/creating nothing.  this bitch *worked* to build his empire.  that takes connections, and he just parted with an important one, one he was close to.  please get better, commenters who are throwing him under.  maybe treat the ADHD with therapy/meditation or ultimately medication.  or dance a little jig on tik tok and be sure to smile for the camera.
The hair is what’s actually catching my attention tbh
How
🙄
Jeffree: I’m So EmOtIoNaL rIgHt NoW”  Me: Could you show some emotion then sis?!?!
Read the comments to see green monsters out prancing wild and ugly, jealous and throwing craps at someone who has to say goodbye to his 2 dear friends. Ya'll are saints and angels, why tatter through this sinful YouTube, so much hypocrisy the mankind is done for.
Ok
Is it really that hard to edit a 10 minute video???
Yes you are a BOSS BITCH & only bigger and better things to come!!!!!
I LOVE 💕 this hair Jeffreelynn!!!!!!
How sad 😔 bye Christian & Maddylynn good luck and best wishes to you both you will be missed but mostly you will be remembered can’t wait to see what you both create in the future !!
Didn’t YouTube FIRE you? Yikes.
We won’t miss ua
Wow he is very beautiful ♥😁
11 minutea and 23 seconds of my life wasted
U a dude or girl?
Yassdssssss
who else watching in 2024??
Shit. I thought you were leaving for good
I missed you too!!!
The background is giving me Belle’s hometown from Beauty and the Beast vibes and I love it so much😭💕
Is your family as weird as you?
literally gtfo this website😭😭
Jeffree: “Goodbye” The dogs: 👁👅👁 👁👅👁
I wanna be ur personal assistant 🥳😭
Good luck to you, Maddie!💜
Good luck, Chris! Thank you for the memories & your talent❤️
People come and go in our lives,  beautiful memories stays, jeffree you are blessed in many ways 😘🤩😘❤
Everyones like "don't watch it camera man left thats it"  But like jefferys energy in videos make me feel happy so like im still watching <3
Gay
I can’t pay attention cause I’m watching the babies.. omg they are so freaking cute! 😍❤️🐾🐶
I can’t watch him without watching his cute little puppies playing in the background 😍😍😍😍😍
Click bait title, period. Not what you would expect him to say. Don't waste your time!
1:50 thank me later
Dude, it's not like your camera man died or anything he just left. you could have just told us in an upcming video about this not  wasting half an hour of our life just saying he left, and clickbaiting this video. Bro you be so dramatic sometimes like you want to start drama. just suck it up jefree, and you cant get all the attentions all the time.
His hair is 🌟Bootyful🌟
They both could have been exhausted by his drama surrounding them and seeping into their lives and psyches that they just quit and left it as no hard feelings/bottled up their gripes to avoid more dramatic stuff in their lives. Or they could have just moved on. It’s not like you’d expect a camera guy to film the same thing for the rest of his life and same goes for his assistant. You don’t expect assistants to be assistants to one person for 40 years lmao
Why the hell does his dog sound like a bumblebee👁👄👁
LEAVE
I just received my order & I LOVE it! Love the packaging & the product works wonderfully! Thank u! 💜
You have gone Through a lot?? Seriously 🙄
Hit up Andrew and get him to film for youuuu
lol so predictable for a new makeup line reveal video to drop after this clickbate video. 😳
Plot Twist Maddie and Christian ran away together!
I'm trying to start up a new nail business from home but since the covid I have no money and my depression and anxiety has gotten alot worse. Watching your videos cheer me up and I can't wait for your next video.
Iconic
Damn thought you were finally outta here :/
I wish I lived in california like what an opportunity it'd be to work for jeffree star . 😳 He's so talented and creative and it just seems like he'd be so much fun to be around .
bad jefree
please DO say goodbye, we don’t like you jeffree.
"the pandemic has been a lot for me" he says in his multi million dollar house and versace robe 🙄
❤️❤️❤️
I don't know about your personal life but I hope YOU are okay.
You are loved
Don't take the hate comments to heart
Stay safe
Just here for the comments
Why don’t u change to ur gender again the boy i’m sorry but please :<
What a waste of time
I feel like I'm listening to Charlie Brown's teacher.
It’s so funny how everyone is talking shit about clickbait. Yet here you are, you clicked it, congrats. Why keep watching the videos if you dislike someone so much? It truly makes no sense to comment on videos constantly and spreading hate on their page. He is saying goodbye to two very significant people in his life. He can be sad, he can be unhappy, overwhelmed. Stop telling people what they can and cannot be sad about. Someone’s worst day will not look the same as yours.
The thing is Jeffree you are a pathological liar. We all know you and Maddie are not friends at all... she signed an NDA so she can’t speak about the situation! We know they both quit because your a toxic person! Why you don’t follow Maddie on IG why doesn’t she follow you?! You’re pathetic
Yuck
I honestly thought he was going to shave his brows 😭😂
His camera man?? I don't know what I was expecting but it wasn't this
Yo i know this music....its so nice
Clickbait title, he needed views.
Please don't read the a**holes comments. Ya still have people. They make your views. Haters gunna hate.
You’ll be okay!
My dad just passed away March 3 2021 so it’s hard for me cause im only 11 almost 12
Nice clickbait, like alwaysss jfs
why do you keep puffing like that ? are you constipated ? 💩
thank you to everyone in the comments saving me the 11 minutes😌
Transgender
I’m surprised anyone still cares about this reptile
Damn I got excited for nothing such a shame you are not leaving YouTube
It’s okay to cry Jef. We're just human and feeling sad and letting it go is good for spiritual growth. Love your hair by the way.
Hold hold on... is she a man?!
I love the comments. It made me not watch. Thank you!
WHAT HAPPENED TO HIS CAMERAMAN? 🔥
So weird seeing your hands without those gorgeous nails!! 😅
No lie, I was a personal assistant and it was great until the pandemic hit and I realized that I wasn't spending time with my family enough. I get where both are coming from. I was to only a department head in a company. Being one to a celebrity or to Jeffree would be more difficult because of the unpredictability and travel.
The dark loves destroy no matter what you call them. Jeffrey needs to stay safe and hopefully he will be surrounded by good people who truly love him. In the past those like him would be protected by the Spirit People but in this sick world his gifts are wasted. Stay safe buddy. There is more to life then this.
I don’t know why but he seems more real in this video he’s not “on” and I kinda like it. Even in his apology videos it still seems a bit produced, not really in a bad way but he was in “YouTuber mode” whereas here he just seems like a person. And we tend to forget influencers are people too, and this person just lost 2 good friends.
I can be a camera guy
Ahhh no man here I thought he was a leaving damn what a let down and click bait 🙄
If I was in the US, I would have literally moved to California to stalk Jeffree till I get hired as his next assistant 😆.. unfortunately I'm not so I'm gonna congratulate his next assistant and wish them the best.
WHO TF CARES ABOUT YOUR CAMERMAN-
Jeffree we are done here. This is dumb Click bate bullshit
How can you compare losing a relative due to Covid with you saying 'goodbye' to a personal assistant and a cameraman? You're such a drama clown...
Seriously for a moment I thought Chris was dead. (Sorry Chris didn’t mean to be mean)
I’m sorry how much are you worth again? I think you’ll be able to hire a new cameraman bby
I wonder if they included Maddie on JSC’s PR List
Jesus loves you Jeffree
When it said saying goodbye I thought it meant saying your body YouTube and I'm like oh my God girl
Cry me a river. Lie lie. Chris got out. Me me me Jeffrey Skidmark. 💩🧠🤡
Bye sisters
Please stop saying it's only his cameraman leaving. It isn't. It's also another employee that's leaving too. Geeze. Watch the stupid video before making your comments.
Why did i think in the beginning of the video that Jeffrey was gonna say Christian died? 😂😂😂
OH...GOOD
God who cares stfu
Please do not leave
you’re the perfect balance of the Ethereal and down to earth.
Ramble ramble ramble he's losing his cameraman ramble ramble ramble.    I wish it was actually him who was leaving the platform and not his cameraman
Ive missed you Jeffree, thank you for this upload - giving us an insight of what you been experiencing on the real the last few months on the back drop of covid - its not easy experiencing the unknown in public. Here for you when you are able to share yourself with us. Love your channel & your uniqueness- thats why ive missed ya! All the best for this new stage & challenges. Do you & im hear for ya :-)
wish you would leave too.
We ❤️ you. Stay strong boo😘
Your boring so I’m moving on byeeeeeee
It’s been a lot for Jeff to not be able to travel guiyzzzzz......pooor thing. 🙄🙄
You look awesome and beautiful I love your hair and makeup
I noticed a long time ago that Madison and Jeffree unfollowed each other. Willing to bet there was drama
bye Chris :///
I love you, Moses!!
2:04 bro.. did his dog just say "let me out"??
you know how to record w a camera my god😭😭💀
OH MY GOD! I literally cried just looking at you now 😢 Be strong Jeffree!!! There’s lots of people who’s supporting and believe in you. Have your time for now before you hire your next cameraman. God bless you Jeffree!
Thanks for the comments, the 4 seconds wasn’t worth it hahah
Fucking clickbaiter
0:55 seconds i wasted for clicking. Thanks to the comments. Bye y'all
I live in southeast Idaho not to far from Wyoming
Click bait
You can’t have a bunch of cute Pomeranians in a video and expect me to pay attention to anything you say
"Saying goodbye" *not even one week later* LOOK AT MY NEW PALATE
Just so sad Chris is leaving. He was such a great guy!!! What happened to your hair. I just saw your Instagram and your beautiful platinum hair went.
i am only here because i thought this would be an apology or something.  why is he still on youtube? omfg when will he realize NO ONE CARES
Awwwww was hoping he would leave youtube
This is embarrassing
Setting up the camera to seem serious
Too bad it isn't you that's leaving YouTube. Only reason ill ever click on a video of yours 😂
Me still trying to find a nice comment 😅😂
Please join the 41% club anorexic crackhead.
CANT GET ANY JEFFREE STAR  LIQUID LIPSTICK IN MY FAV COLORS IN FRANCE, IM SO DESPERATE!!!!
Wtf he is gay
Ill be ur camera girl babe
For those who were saying that Jeffree Star is a brat Influencer and make up creator , excuse me! You do not know him personally . You can see on this video on how the way he supported the decision of his Camera Man and Personal Assistant , even though it's hard for him. He respected their decisions in life and that was the true meaning of being a good friend and a good boss at the same time. God bless you jeffree 😘
CAN I APPLY AS CAMERAWOMEN
Wait people still like him
I have a question for everyone commenting... is it hard setting up a Camara and your lighting after 5 years of seeing exactly where the lighting and Camara goes? Just to sit down and do a make up challenge where you stay in one place. I'm just asking because I feel like everyone that's commenting can set up a tripod.
Goodbye Patricia
I'm connecting the dots
Goodbye Lera Tera not gonna be missed
Jeffrey, all I will say and can ever say is you have always brought people into your life that you know, trust and believe in. You bring growth and opportunity to everyone that you touch and who touches you. Maddie and Christian have both not only proven their worth and devotion but, you have also given them more opportunities than they could ever imagine. They know that and for you to know that they are so talented in everything they do it doesn’t go unnoticed and you are proud of their growth. It takes so much.

Youtubers are so dramatic
Sadly not many people care jeffree. Your actions made you lose a lot of support
So you basically made a video to tell us about your camera man leaving your channel
EXPECTATION VS REALITY  EXPECTATION: FINALLY HE'S QUITING YOUTUBE 😇 REALITY: HIS CAMERA MAN IS THE ONE WHO'S LEAVING 😑  ME: ANDUWFQJWDAAQWDDCOSNEIFNWDUWBDFUWKDNCIWWJWOQFYICBSWBFFMWA
If I lived closer to Jeffree definitely would try to be his assistant
i  want  to  baby sit  the  dogs

Hi
ooo yuh get it ig
what the fuck hes a man?
We will miss everyone who helped get u to where you r now ❤️❤️❤️
Omg his personal assistant is also gone 😱. Imagine actually having to work instead of sipping your drink and playing with your Pomeranians and asking someone to do everything for you!? Dude you’re a millionaire stfu
GOD DAMMIT. I THOUGHT YOU WERE LEAVING BUT YOU HAD TO MAKE A DRAMATIC ASS VIDEO ABOUT A DAMM CAMERAMAN.
Talk about click bait title.
My fat self thought his hair had bacon it it 🤦‍♀️🥓
He really needed to boost those views..gone from getting an average of 10M views on videos to just about scraping 1M. Thanks for the comments who informed me to bounce out this video again quick.
Fuck. I only clicked cuz I was hoping to hear he is going to fuck off from youtube.
I’m just going to sigh a lot and be dramatic about my non problems
You should’ve left
i thought he was leaving danggg
Love, love love the hair!
U are sick, man
what about shane´s camera man, andrew? he´s so sweet, and deserves the world
why not andrew?
Hire me!!!!!
I was hoping he was leaving
Before you carry on watching dw i gotchu: he’s not leaving YouTube, his camera man is leaving
Ur annoying give me a birken bag
From pity parties about his crew leaving to stealing other brands’ ideas.... damn click bait drama bull crap.
❤️❤️❤️
Love u babe💜 some1 posted a negetive comment and every brainless person followed suit. We love u, that's why we're watching and subscribed🕉
Thank u comments🥰
Youre literally a white supremacist
I love you Jeff❤   Please hire me when I come to LA I'M SO POOR😭
Thanks to all the comments that warned me im getting clickbaited
Still love him . Good luck w ur journey!!  Love u Jeffrey :) hi puppies!!!!!! This channel makes me week so much betterrrrrrr
Nightmare fuel.
I like how everyone is subscribed and "excited" because they assumed he was leaving Youtube.. first of all. Then to say "I knew it was clickbait anyway" RIGHT. Lastly, to be claiming he is making so much money off the video.. there weren't a bunch of advertisements to make money off of that I noticed. Thanks for viewing and commenting.       Now STFU.💘 🤫
Avocados from Mexico 🥑
Clickbait savant.
And good riddance
Wish you left
Just get it over and done with!!
Lame
Thanks to the comments. Y’all are appreciated.
Interesting how he mentioned all the deaths and turmoil during pandemic, yet that didn't seem to stop him from releasing his Cremated palette #TACKY
k but like why does a monster need to have such cute dogs
Do you know Michelle Dy? Omy HAHAHAHAHAHHA
clickbait
That îs the ugliest wig i've ever seen.
stop talking about "how far" you've come... time and time again you've proven to be just aweful.. be a real human and stop acting like you're gods gift to the world
I was really hoping you were the one leaving but-
Bye. Just stop.
I Don't Really mind seeing the whole video but only if I put this page from normal to 1.75 or two. I mean I know the comments here helping me get the main info but still I kinda enjoy him speaking but on extremely high speed.
I’m not gonna watch this video I just came to say he makes a goodbye video every couple of weeks and never leaves.
Get Shane behind the filming..
CEO of click bait
Vete pues
I thought you were saying goodbye... damn it for wishful thinking.
😂😂😂😂
Hah! GAYYYYYY
when clickbait fails
dang you fell off
WY? That's scary! So right-wing Conservative Evangelical Christian and GOP Alt/R, Skin Heads, neo-nazis,.QNON. Jeffrey, why WY?
Trying to get Jeffrey s attention!!! Hello! Your Pom, the one that favors a baby possum, is trying to eat the fabric!
So much hate in this comment section lmao
Y’all are just plain mean and disrespectful. The way I see it is Jeffree is losing someone who basically helped him along the way and was on the star journey. They bonded with each other. Does not mean chris is quitting on jeffree. Stop hating. Love you jeffree and Chris we will miss you ❤️
I have paused the video and all the good stuff, I wish this comment wasn’t even needed, my comment may get deleted,  and for those who get to see it, this title should say enough for you. Jeffree is here for money/views. With everything going on, this title is literally so clickbait it’s unbelievable. Yes i clicked, because I thought he was finally coming clean and saying good bye, but the fact that it has nothing to do with that proves Jeffree is a liar and will do anything for more power. Edit: I’m not responding to any comments because I refuse to come back to this video and give it more attention. Say what you want.
How can I call him ..       As by saying gayyyy????
His/her cameraman has actually seen the light and chose to get away from this persons toxic shit. There, I just saved people 11 minutes of nothing
I LOVE YOU XOXO
Ugh!!! Yuck!
Bruuuuuuh
What I would give to be Jeffrees assistant
I had a dream we became friends and I was your assistant then I see this. So can you hook a girl up with a job. Xoxo
You hiring lol?
i got so excited for nothing.
Dang, he really clickbaited for views. Once upon a time, he didnt even had to think about the title, the views would just go insane. Oh damn
Lmao I was happy when I saw the title, but disappointed with the video 🤣
i came here for the comments. and i’m not disappointed 😂 this guys lost touch with reality
The end of an era
THANK GOD
Damn I was so happy but then I saw the comments. This video is a waste of time. (Thx for the summary btw)
Thank God this comment section exists so I didn't need to see the video. I'm grateful to the poor souls who watched this video to tell us what is happening.
Click bait at its finest. Camera man is leaving not this foo
Love you Jeffree, I'm sure the right people will appear at the perfect time. It's all about a positive mental attitude and watching for those synchronicities to lead the way. The puppies are so cute! They grow up fast, soon they'll be in college hehe :D
Blablabla...
Must suck to have to do shit by yourself without  a pa or cameraman
F R E A K
Hey! That's my name too. But I'm fat😒
Which lipstick are you wearing? It’s perfect.
Dude...can everybody who want jeffree to leave just leave? Gosh nobody forces you to watch or support him...
holy f!cking hell you are hideous  wow that takes legit talent im impressed
It sounds like bees buzzing in the background 🐝🤣
is that hair by jay?
I WAS SO EXCITED FOR HIM TO LEAVE UGH
You got me excited 😕
https://youtube.com/c/iLovUAllah https://youtube.com/c/iLovUAllah https://youtube.com/c/iLovUAllah https://youtube.com/c/iLovUAllah https://youtube.com/c/iLovUAllah .0.
Hello
Hi  it seems  you  can  read  upside  down  or  maybe  you  cheated  and   turned  your  screen  over  either  way,  I  thank  you  for reading  this  comment  and  also  get  back  to  watching  the  video  why  are  you  still   there?  Anyways  have  a  great  day/ night  ahead  :)
Yr adorable !
انت راجل ولا مرة
I always like the cameramans more than the youtubers, idk y. 🤣
U could’ve just tweeted this or smth u didn’t have to make a huge deal
Good for your cameraman for leaving. I wouldn’t be able to work with you either 😀
Wow I seriously got excited cuz I thought Jeffrey was leaving YouTube
Are you actually serious? Gtfoh. Nobody cares.
Alright, bye flop!
Thank god for the comments. Saved so much time
People are literally dying because of a pandemic, losing their houses, losing everything they have ever had and you are complaining about losing a camera man?
I don't know why I bother anymore with this dude 😭😭😭
Not even a minute into the video and already leaving thanks to the comments letting me know the title is click bait and it’s the camera man that’s leaving. Good bc I don’t want to contribute to this monster’s view count.
This is sad and desperate
I've just watched 11min 24 seconds of Donatella the dog playing next to him and I've NEVER enjoyed a J* video so much!!!! I have NO idea what he said but the dogs are AWESOME!!
Title got me excited for nothing. Thanks comments for saving me 11 minutes of that voice.
girl bye
So stupid🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
What a freak show.
And yet he keeps posting. Jeffree, you’re no longer a Star x
CLICKBAIT! He’s hired a new camera man and saying goodbye to the old one. You’re welcome!
4 seconds in, thanks to all the commenters you're  the real HEROES!
Ok? Byeeee😻
Damn, thought he was quitting Youtube.  Maybe someday.
omg love the honesty here, you handle this situation so well, remember that you are an amazing, smart, wonderful person! <3
i was watching both ID and Jeffree but ID was more interesting to watch so i left half way watching this video..sorry.
Can we just appreciate the look because  Also, Y'all need to meditate. Jeffree does anything... He could blink and everyone will be like "OMG Staaap, you're being so dramatic right now. "
This comment section is a treasure
i love you
God... I wish he was really leaving...
Ugggghhhhh I NEED ATTENTION....THESE PEOPLE DO SPIRITUAL THINGS BUT STILL HAVE ISSUES WITH THEMSELVES. INSECURE ISSUES....
lol bye, no one is gonna miss u edit; damn, what a shame
Every single YouTube : LAST VIDEO ON YOUTUBE   Days later : POST a YOuTUBe viDEo
Even the camara man got tired of his shit😂
Awww okay!    Anyways,,
Can we get a channel or maybe a video of the dogs just doing there thing for the day. There so cute. Just like a dog cam maybe???
girl
I hate you
Litteraly no one cares
I'm so over all these youtubers acting like their million dollars can't fix their $5 problems
Almost 12 min and could've said in 1 min. Drama Queen!
We love Chris, I really am gonna miss him so so much. I wish him all the best
This guy is such a trip 😀I’m not sure who or what he is, but all those tattoos have to go if you want to look female
I desperately wish you were leaving
You’re whole vibe is falling apart. It’s called reality and change is coming
B**ch you need to make your point faster, you owe me 11 mins of my life back. Could this video mean Jeffrey's ⭐ is fading? Has he peaked? Tune in next time folks, the plot she thickens
Well played,    I almost believed it.
Why does he make that sound in the begginig
Honestly you can do filming yourself dude
watching on 1.5 speed like it’s an online class
Why did this show up when I searched nikocado avocado?
I wish he was leaving, maybe we wouldn't have such pussies in this world
Ew
I wanna be your assistant Jeffree pleaseee DM on Instagram: arnold.martz
Hey @jeffree I can be your camera man, give me the chance to work with you.
Jeffrey: says goodbye Yt: post new video
Thank you for the click bait Jeff 🙃
Scientists should invent a physical mute button to make this guy shut the fuck up
I would love to get his job, you Are a beautifull person jeffery❤️
I loveee u Jeffery
Leave and never come back
Dont ask me how I ended up here. But! I am out! WTF do people be watching.
why did he say “sadly there is no tea... there is no gossip there is drama...” ?? Like, as in sad he couldn’t report on anything dramatic?
Clickbait
Ha ha Andrew be ignoring J*'s calls like 🙃
Wowww biggest waste of my time since the Grammys
im sad because of the clickbait... we ALL wish you were leaving
Was legit hoping jeffree was the one saying goodbye😑... Oh well, back to not acknowledging his existence.
Best of luck. If I can help let me know.
The click bait is real here
Ok i don’t like you because you said nigga and your a sidechick for Kim’s ex so whatever is happening to you is your karma
Damn 😩I know the struggle! I also don't have a camera person or assistant 😭 you must be struggling so much 😔 some people just aren't willing to be open minded 🤕 and understand where you're coming from 😞
So your eyebrows are gone again too?
Good....
so many bitter and hate comments i can't u guys need to just leave the channel and stop hatin"
he’s irrelevant until he makes these type of videos...
are you gay jeffreestar?
Collecting views jefree.....
transform
Me asusta mucho este tipo🤣🤣🤣
Boy if you don’t go back in the closet...
Why u look like and sound like Caitlyn Jenner ?? Ooo
No one cares Jeff sit down
I always have nightmares about you:(
Man I thought he would  end yt I was i happy man- :(
Useless clickbait.  The fact that it’s necessary is pathetic.
I went straight to the comments to see what bs this video was going to be about this time. Yep, glad everyone else is on the same page, lol.  I'M SAYING GOODBYE.... to watching anymore than the first two seconds of this video after I paused it.
Unfortunately he’s not leaving! More click bait!
This thing thinks the puppies can change our thoughts, this thing is a loser
Must be so hard to find a good trusting crew , wish u all the best in finding your new work family ♥️
Sounds like a shallow and superficial pink thing crawling out of a slimy grey hole to clickbait the F out of YouTube users. So,  good riddance to either or both of you,  you phoney.
Yawn was hoping you were going to leave YouTube. Thanks for the disappointment
Is that a man?
damn thought the day finally came
Now leave for real this time! ✨😁
Praying for you and your peace ♥️♥️♥️ all good vibes for Jeffery star  ⭐️
good nobody cares 😉
I dont give a fuck and why is this shit keep popping up under my recommendation!
I watched Nutella the whole time.
🤮
Y’all be making fun of him for talking about a cameraman leaving, but that shows Jeffree is loyal and has respect for his crew
One minute of my life I'm never getting back ... need to stop watching pointless things.
Friggen love you!!!!!!!!!
i accidentally tuned out jeffree and watched the dogs the entire time
Yeah I’m sure these people just randomly thought to move on when it came out what a bad person he is
You’re amazing .
why are you even still here?
WTF, I almost had a small stroke. Had to read the comments before watching. He isn’t leaving YouTube! He’s saying goodbye to his cameraman .
Cringe
the vaccine will feel like your arm is about to fall off on the second day of getting it. (the arm that got the shot). my aunt who is an essential worker got it, so that’s how i know.
Love you Jeffree!
aight cya
Gets so boring, it’s about his fucking cameraman. His channel is dying and he’s panicking
If you need a new assistant i’m totally here for it ! this would be my biggest dream since you started youtube ✨✨
Loool did he need to tell us! He could’ve got a new camera man and we wouldn’t have fucking noticed
How's Kanye
We love u Jeffri, be strong
Кто-нибудь пожалуйста 🙏🏻 переведите коротко о чём идёт речь 🗣 🤷🏼‍♀️😢
When you don't wanna watch the video but the dogs are adorable
Shoot I’ll be your camera guy !
He worries more about losing an employee than his actuall friends
Thank god
Damn guys he obviously really cares about his Cameraman it may not seem important to y’all but it is to him ^ - ^ I would actually rather have the person I’m working for make a video about me instead of him not caring at all since not only was he the cameraman he was also Jeffreys friend
get a life man
I need a job 😫 hahha
Do people actually enjoy watching this dude? I see no kind of entertainment here except that I can laugh at him
I thought got canceled with Shane ???🤨🧐
See you next month
Ahhh your amazing I love you🥰
Dude is 100 percent DRAMA
Me: watching the dogs during the whole video Jeffree: I will see you guys in a few days thanks for watching  Me: ok what was that again?
Jeffree stressing out about losing some employees while so many people are losing their jobs unwillingly and don't know how to feed their families. As for me I have had cancer this year and had surgery 3 times for that. I am not healing right from the last surgery and may need a fourth. Jeffree you are so out of touch with the real world. I don't feel sorry for you. Just hire some more people and pay them well so they can take care of their families.
That's gotta be hard they've been with him thru it all
This is cliffbait.
Poor jenna marbles gets canceled
Aww ☺️ cris! Good luck on your journey 😘😘😘 stay safe! Jeffree! You’ll find a good one 🙂
Yes 2020 has changed many lives they've realized they have real life creeping in.
Y'all are so mean,  if y'all don't like someone just don't come around. There is zero reason for anyone to be so hateful twards another human being.  How hard is it to just block and delete??  Like seriously people,  what happened to the saying "If you don't have anything nice to say then don't say anything at all"  All the hate is unnecessary , if you don't want to watch,  or you are looking for drama,  just go away.  Simple.  Spread love not hate.
#BOSSBITCH
Jeffree, heart felt saying goodbye to a dear close friend and also a personal assistant. (Intimacy issues and abandonment issues...) Sorry some people don't give a f*ck.  I care.  Good luck. I send you positive vibes, I hope you add good people to your personal circle.
Ill do it , we are ready to pack and move from tucson whenever lol.
Frankenstein stop stealing women's space.
imagine being canceled and most hated and still click baiting
i cant take this seriously with his dogs eating each other in the background im sry
So many harsh comments. I haven't watched in a long minute. Work & life but  Jeffree I wish you well & you will be ok.
AUTOMATIC DISLIKE
I need a job I’m disable but I think I will be a really good PR hired me 🙋‍♀️🙋‍♀️🙋‍♀️
One word... ew
Love everything your about and what you represent ☺️
Please feel very fortunate to even be where you are at in life Jeffree, I struggle to pay for my retinal hemorrhage shots I have to get once a month...in my eye... it's been a emotional traumatic experience. You look stunning but remember things could always be worse.
He went from people dying to Chris not being the camera man anymore.
Don’t care didn’t watch
Thank God you're gone
👸 wishing you the best
People are dying and suffering from the pandemic and he's so sad that his camera man is leaving. Hmmmmm
I know I’ll probably get shit for this comment but Jeffree, even though people are being complete assholes in the comments, stay strong, take care of your mental health, and stay true to you. I hope through everything, you are able to find new partners to ride along in the Jeffree Star journey. ♥️
Looks like Bella Thorne pretending to be a man who is pretending to be a woman.
Rich bitch problems... *shakes head*
Ok bye. Please.
Awe, don't get me excited, I thought you were finally fucking leaving 💚
I'm not trying to assume anything    butttttttt I think he just did this for views and money.
You will always do a good job with who ever you have but it is so hard to start over with new staff keep positive and keep smiling 😊❤️
Awwww this sucks two of the people u trust the most have gone awww
Whats going on, is everything ok. I hope so
I am living for the dogs and the wig!!!  Stay positive!!  Thank you for giving positive!!
That’s what’s up!! I’m sorry JS is a mentor! I know and understand how it feels to start in the beginning!  JS gave Chris and Maddy Lyn a foundation to build off! And in the end that’s only going to prosper them and their families and their future ahead
YOOO Chris has been with him for a minute he obviously appreciated the man and respected his decision he’s looking for a new camera person so maybe he wants to give someone an opportunity let’s be positive folks!!!
I'm Mr. Worst and I don't even need to edit this. I'm literally just going to reupload this video on my channel with a brief intro saying why this person is one of the worst... Thank you for making my job easy.
Almost had a heart attack when I read this title!
If you need a part time personal assistant in Casper- you hit me up and we can talk 💕
He’s breathing more that talking
This comment section is glorious
i’m so sorry you have to go through so much, holding a camera by yourself is so hard. life must be so hard for someone who lives in a $14.6 million dollar house with a net worth of $200 million 😔💔
I love your honesty and just letting us in  your life. And I’m sorry you e been through a lot.
Why do people watch him? Make up tutorials, personality, drama, or all? I’m seriously asking since the internet isn’t giving me too many answers.
The hair 💕💕💕💕 and the robe 👘 love it.
>There's a lot of goodbyes I need to say.  >two goodbyes
I feel bad for Jeffree, it is a real mess to bring someone new into a life like his.  Never knowing who you can trust, and the consequences could be huge.  Not to mention you really need to click.  Good luck Jeffree, pick wisely.
Wtf is that
Very minors problems of a very privileged person. F*** cry me a river.
A whole colection inspired by your dogs please
Do not go Jeffree.You are one of the best MUAs
I love your puppies.They are soooo adorable...
I’d be your assistant! I’m a dog groomer
Clickbait .....👎
👁)👄(👁
Whats this man talking about?
So many toxic comments. Like where’s the love? Everyone deserves love guys. All the top comments are toxic...... so shoutout to the nontoxic people
The ones that go must follow their own path and blessings to them along their way to find themselves. You were part of the roots that allowed them to spring forward. The next key people to play a role in your life will find their way to you all by themselves. best of luck!
que agonia dele no começo ajeitando a camera
Idk why anyone would be mad if Jeffree only put out videos when there are new launches or products coming out...so what? YouTube is for whatever content you want to upload and if he doesn’t want to put his whole life on there or be on there every second w drama who cares? I’m here for his makeup honey and if that’s all he posts about it’s all good 💯
NOBODY CARESSSS
Why is every Youtuber saying "Goodbye"!
Maddie is 33 lol
Not me thinking Jeffree saying his goodbye on YouTube 👁👄👁💧
Would happily move countries to be your assistant 😂
bye bye looseerrrrr just a camera queennnn js rocksssss
👁👅👁
Damn I was so ready to say bye b-🤬
Spill the info on Chris
Jeffreestar: *Talking about Chris* The dogs: Lemme make it not emotinal and make it wholesome 😌🤘
Side note though, that wig is so cute omg
Hang in there Jeffrey!! You GOT THIS!! Your COSMETIC’S ARE THE BOMB🌟.
People are such crappy-gossiping trolls. Some of us understand people move on. FYI, it’s losing not loosing people!!! ( pet peeve word mix up ) I’m sure Jeffree will find some awesome people to work for him!
Omg is he for real??! Dreadful! Urgh. How do people watch this.
Clickbait
It’s funny as fuck that y’all are hating but literally came to give him this view and comment. Like, you’re paying him rn 🤣🤣 literally would be more likely to believe you hate him if you wouldn’t even have the thought of clicking on a video 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
WHY DOES HE LOOK LIKE HELLO KITTY GOODBYE
King of clickbait
You are going to be marrying kanye
Jeffrey really needs his own tv drama show
I thought that tiny little pooch, (Donnatella) was fake! It looked as though two of the fur babies were tackling a tiny toy and then I saw her flip herself over and her tiny legs were flying everywhere! So cute...gotta love all little puppies. They are pure joy. Other than that I have no idea what the hell is going in this video, but I'm kinda diggin' it. Perhaps I have issues.
You have basically upset a lot of people and apologizing is really nothing. You need to make people think you are really sorry and the fact that you were laughing about it is discussing l. Sorry luv but I am truly upset.
I was hoping he was leaving
bruh why would he play us like that?? like no one cares that his cameraman left and he knows that. he just needed something click bait-y to get attention
honestly i was literally just watching the dogs play the entire time
Just got his Orgy palette.  Never thought I would LOVE a matte palette but....oh yes!!!
🇱🇸🇱🇸🇱🇸
Kanye is gonna be disappointed that you're clickbaiting.
Clickbait
Clickbait.
God I hope I never end up as insecure as Jeffree
No offense
Why you look so ugly
That's a man man.
His hair is so cute. I can’t.
Currently at 26 Subscribers, catching up with the YouTube kings LOL
Damn this wack.... u really had us excited and then u dropped the saddest news ever and said it’s was your camera man that leaving 😣😫
"02:49" Greetings! But it's much easier with * ᴍᴏʙᴅᴜᴅᴇ .ᴄᴏᴍ* as I know
It’s okay Jeffery! HEALLLLL and take the time time to restore your soul. We still stand by the videos 🌈
Emäsemäsemäsemäsemäs
when you keep on adding and to an essay to make it big
Wish it was him 😥
I would love to be your personal assistant!!!!
Lots of love from India 😍
I watched this hoping your toxic ass self would completely leave YouTube.
He never gets irritate by his dogs 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMltjjI0bU4
but jeffre star never dies in my life
Love you Jeffree. ❤️❤️
Major change indeed. I'm sure it's gonna feel empty in the mansion. Life is tough already for all of us. Here in Quebec Canada, the curfew was at 8 pm, up until this week! Sending lots of good vibes. 💕
Goodbye
oh my god just get off youtube already🤢🤢
How many time will he exhale before actually saying anything?
Ugh another clickbait.
God bless you all in Jesus’ name!  The LORD is coming soon, and we all must be ready!  Repent of your sins and believe in Jesus Christ and you will be saved!
Good luck with finding the right person jeffree. Looking forward to more videos! ❤
I was hoping he was leaving tbh
I don't blame him
Im gonna miss him.
I LIVE FOR YOU  🧍🏻‍♀️
Good and great creativity make more related video's👌👌👌👌👌👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
Omg plzzz don't put that vaccine in your body omg don't do it so much shit is happening to people who have taken it bad things it's not safe
There has to be more to these people leaving. There always is. Jeffree's life is crazy town. Unless you're buying a ticket for crazy town yourself, don't take a job with him.
he wanted to get pass the 10 minute mark by saying huhhh hoo haa *deep breathing* haaaaaa huuuuuuuuuu and i felt like we had to *extreme exhale*
Happy all is good and they will forever love you as well!!! ❤
Ningguang hehe
Maybe if you treated people better 🤔
Quit YouTube please
k
Im so glad i went to the coments before watching the full vid
Wait why did jeffre star camera man leave also I know some YouTubers dont have a camera man and can do it fine
* plays world's smallest violin * 🎻🥺 just leave YouTube already lmao
PEOPLE IN THE COMMENT SECTION ARE HYPOCRITES AF! GURL MOVE ONE, WE ALL CHANGE BECAUSE NOTHING IS CONSTANT. WE CANNOT JUDGE SOMEONE EASILY BECAUSE WE OURSELVES ARE UNCERTAIN OF OUR LIVES! LET EVERYONE LIVE LIFE AND ENJOY IT. BITTER PEOPLE DON'T END UP SUCCESSFUL GOSH

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiZWqr5turA
Video aside, hope you all have a great day.
We never said hello.
Yes Gaga. CANCEL
Everything will fall into place for you! You're a masterpiece!😍
There's a season and a reason for everything! God bless you in all you do! I've been praying for confidence & strength & bravery to start my YouTube channel! I have to not care what people say or think about all the negative crap!❤ It's because of you & Shane that have given me the motivation to do this!!💚😍  Stay strong!😇
I’ve been reading these comments since this video came out ( yes I’m lonely) and none of them are positive 😭 I agree with some thoo
Jeffree gets upstaged by his dogs ..
Freak
Just go
Nic YouTube
Jeffre you got way to pomeranians give 1 to me
“Goodbyyeeee”  girl voice
Ugh I got so excited thinking the rat went back to the gutters
SUMMARY: HE'S NOT LEAVING YOUTUBE UNFORTUNATELY, HIS CAMERAMAN IS.
'Creep'..You're nauseating.
Thanks for the clickbait Disgusting
I made a new channel but there is no one to support me
Damnit, I came here with hopes and dreams, only to get shot down
Stop being so negative you guys. Let people do what they want to whether it's an 11 mins video just to say his cameraman is gone or whatever. Watch and move on or don't watch at all. Don't spread the hate.
damn i was really hoping he was leaving youtube. way to get my hopes up.
Is he still alive? Is this video a goodbye video? let’s pray for this vlogger that he rest..
thank you to the comments. i saved 11 min and 23 sec of my life not watching this
Bye  Hahsa
"00:40" Greetings! But it's much easier with *Mobdude .com* as I know
oh planet earth calling...jeffree are you there?
So funny seeing james charles having more subs than you 🤣🤣
I couldn’t focus because of the spa  music
Anyways who had their ad blocker on for this one lol
Such a clickbait !!!!!!!! World dealing with a pandemic 😷 and he’s making a drama about his camera guy leaving him . Jesus Christ 🤦🏻‍♀️
Wow after reading the comments there is a lot of hate, so many people saying they are disappointed Jeffrey is not leaving. Why all the hate?
Bye.
No one cares
I am reading this comments,  and, who cares what all of you guys thinks,  If you don't like it, just go away from the channel please.  This is so emotional, he is saying goodbye to the person he cared about. ❤
TY EVERYONE FOR TELLING ME WHAT HAPPENS
Literally thought he was leaving, got my hopes up, would’ve made for one hell of a video lmao
He’s scared the cameraman will expose his secrets 🤣
Goodbye?!?! You promise? Cause you just won’t go away... ya keep reoccurring like herpes
Jeffree you got this. Your true fans know you hun. So keep your head up and let the haters hate. Like people say if there talking about you they are making you money LOL!! From one business woman to another love you and let them talk hunny
Stay gone.
me; crying nuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu whyyyy
I d be honored to be ur assistant. Ilysm
I wanna stan Jeffery sooo bad because he’s so cute and ughh! 🙄🥺...but I can’t cus he’s too damn scandalous😔  I’ve followed him since I was 12 ☹️
Damn, that title got me excited 😔✌
So annoying
everyone hating on the length of this video but he literally said within the first 3 minutes what was happening
Byyyyyyeeee
lmao as he deserves
Can we make it the most dislike vid coz he is so over acting.
💜💜 new chapters ahead!!
Click bait to get views..
Be happy🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Thanks bestie later 🙏
Bye sis 👋
Ugh bye tf
Just came to dislike this guys video
God (or whatever you guys believe in) bless you all for saving me 11 minutes and 20 seconds of my life. These comments came through for sure💀
How tf does this person have 16 mil subs people like this should be canceled high key
yup clicked on this video just for the comments, never watched a jefree video in my life, and i dont plan to
this guy is something else.
lol the video title was a cash grab yall he got us he knows this video title would be popular
This is the white people that...nevermind....lets just not take her opinions serious anymore
Lol i was happy for no reason
I get why everyone is so upset, but I empathize with jeffree. Change is hard and he is losing close people... he’s just a human. He has feelings. Its not just losing a camera man or losing an assistant , it’s losing people he cares about... dukkha.
You fucking FIRED CHRIS?!? I am a boss so I know that language. He fired him. Maddie MAY have been fired too. This is the way bosses talk about people who have been FIRED. LIAR JEFREE 🤥🤥🤥🤥
You're so sweet. Best wishes for you and those that are moving on.
Totes hate the hat 🤡
I hope the best for you Jeffree ...
Ok so my last comment got deleted because I’m guessing it mentioned his camera man’s name that’s fine but I’m gonna still say my point i get why...Jeffree ur the reason cameraman/best friend has to move on because you went down the wrong path and he is better than you someone needs to say it ( I’m also not trying to assume Jeffree was his only client... actually said it better this time so thank you for deleting my comment I watched Kylie’s video first getting drunk with Kendall lmao and followed along I’m truly sorry if this is a mess to make up but I know y’all see it top
who cares????
I just started following you and found Jeffery amazing. Jeffery take your time can't wait to new videos soon.
I’m moving to L.a I’ll be looking for new and life changing moves 💪🏽😏
POV:  you all jumped to the comments 👀
2020 has been hard for you, sweetie, tell us about it.
😒🤦‍♀️Ugh... seriously?🙄
Bruh I thought he was leaving, now I am disappointed.😞😒😔
glad I'm not the only one who came here to pause the video before it even started and just read the comments
Fanciest guy on YouTube
YASSS
Another petty money grab, as usual, while millions of people are suffering
Jeffree hire me! Omg!
Now it’s your turn to leave
is it just me or does his face look really different, like it's getting rounder?
Everyone eventually leaves a narcissist, whoops
YAY NO MORE DRAMA I mean nooooo please dont quit noooooooo im sooooo sad
Jeffree you scared me I thought you were leaving YouTube!!!
Its one thing celebrating how far you've come from where you started...its another flaunting your millions when many people are losing homes, jobs and lives. Losing a camera man or an assistant is flaunting your wealth. Be humble Jeffree, and remember where you started. Many, many successful people have lost it all in the blink of an eye.
what a joke bye
Desperate.
1st world problems.
i was paying attention to the dogs fighting the whole time lolx
Tell me why tf did this show up when I searched "Amy Adams"
This whole thing is creepy
Saying goodbye to his camera man and the entire rest of the video is him inhaling and exhaling loudly which was so annoying. You're welcome!
Thanks to keem, now i've found my new porn director & actor for my next porn project....."THE DURTE DIARY" directed by The Big D.Dobrik
6 days in and only 4.5m views. LOL
bye LMAO
I'll work for ya babes hire meeeee
Well damn, I guess it's staying.
wonder if he'll ever become a likeable person
mY cAMerA mAn lEFt iTs so bAd
The Amazon River stretches thousands of miles. At some points it runs through areas of the rain forest that are basically untouched and have barely been explored. Because of the porous limestone in these areas, the river water leals through the stone and travels deep into the earth, and forms underground pools almost a mile below the surface. Over thousands of years small, blind, transparent fish have lived and evolved in these pools. These fish have never before seen the sun, the surface, and have never been seen by the human eye.... these fish care more about this than I do.
I'm so so so glad to know that almost everyone who clicked on this video also clicked off almost immediately after reading the comments.  Yeah the view count is high but his viewer retention and watch time will be shite so it won't make as much money.   What a freakin pointless video.  I really was dumb enough to get my hopes up too.   Lmao silly me
God I fucking wish.
Wtf
I would find people who live in Wyoming.They always want to visit L.A. The other way round, maybe not so many
Im pretty sure everyone here is familiar with bonding with a coworker and then being sad that they move on/quit or whatever the case maybe this beautiful alien is no different
Thank god for y'all in the comments, not about to waste my time on a disappointing video
Uhmm 💀💀i cant it took you 11 mins and 24 secs just to tell us your recording person left..🤭🤭🤭🤭🤭
43k dislikes out of 121k likes. He still gets hate 😧 What happened?
This man is disgusting
OMGoooosh , how cuuuute is that baby puppy dog ?!?!?!?! 🤗
I feel like Jeffrey would have bullied me in school..
jeffree a little depressed?🥺🖤🥀
This human sour patch kid could ramble on in a 30 minute video about how his maid didn't make his bed, I swear
Jackass
Jeffreee, I think your curlers are wound too tight.  Maybe you should get a new hobby or a new dog. Life is too short for this nonsense.
it's so sad that he used to get like 40m views and now he doesn't get any just bc of some drama. but then again it was his fault for not staying out of it
It would be so amazing to get to work with J*...all the skills he has, he would make an amazing mentor. I would die for his insight into business and marketing things while working alongside him.
❤️❤️❤️
Apologize...maybe?
He’s stressing out cause his camera man left? DUDE MY MOM AND DAD ARR GETTING DIVORCE AND MY MOM CANT PAY THE DAMN BILLS AND UR WORRIED ABOUT THIS
Gross
Trash clickbait video
Tbh he's annoying
Omg I thought jeffrey star was leaving im so mad that he's drama self isn't leaving
Another lies of YouTubers
Freak
Oh I was so excited for him to leave YouTube 😍
Really Jeffrey you need bite title to get views....just say that your assistant is leaving up front. Cheap....
I'm so sorry :( you have to hold the camera by yourself this must be so hard  😭😭
I had hope, and then ....crushed...He is still....
Cya won’t be missed
Wow... shane still hasn’t uploaded and ryland stopped uploading with his last video have tons of dislikes... but Jeffree still doing good lol.
That is a weird way of saying your camera man left 🤔
boring.
“Saying Goodbye...”   Bye *shrugs*
OMG want anxiety? Work 2 jobs, go to school & try to pay your bills. When you find real stress let me know..
Bruh
I honestly forgot about this man  Also I love how he starts with flexing the fact he's was at a photoshot. And is also sitting on a white/peach couch. With his billion dollar mansion in the background   Very humble indeed
I'm stunned at how many rude and mean comments there are. Jefferee I'm sorry a couple of your friends moved forward in their lives. It's hard when people you care about move away especially when your not use to them being away. Toull get the hang of the camera and filming alone. It tgakes time but you mastered makeup and raising dogs you'll get there. Keep your head up and don't listen to the haters. Funny how everyone has something against bullying then do it to you. I love you. Keel slaying queen
Honestly, I have no idea what he was saying, couldn’t take my eyes of the dogs playing, so funny, so cute, love it🥰
Good for Chris fam.
I saw the title and got excited. Now I’m disappointed
God damn click bait
God I thought you were leaving. You really got my hopes up there. 😐
Thank God. See ya !
What the fuck is this monstrosity?
Got so excited to see this video. Disappointed it's not who I wanted to leave
Awwww M....i luv her!!
Glad it’s not drama drama. Best of luck to Chris. (If that’s how u spell it) his quality will b missed.
Jeffree omg why are u so pretty🥰🥰🤩🤩🤩
Where's your skincare line
Bye
Okay I'm going to need you to do a Jeffree Star approval on Halsey about face please.someone has an opinions their opinions on it but I'd rather hear an opinion from you because you're very good at making makeup in general
clickbair lmao

SNOOP DOG WAS A AD FOR ME-
Camera man leaves  Jeffree Star: Makes 11 min video  Allegations of harassment and R*pe           David dobrik: Makes 2 min video 💀
Jeffree star: *talks about serious situations* The dogs: *HADOUUUKEN*
y everyone hating love u jeffree!
even tho I do not like how you are as a person, I still love you’re videos.
Can I be ur personal assistant :p
I am a videographer dear id be happy to come over and film whatever you need my dear..it would be an honour.
K bye
Hi sisters
world's longest non-goodbye ever.
Jeffree plz PLZ get Shane, I miss all your guy’s content also if you see this hi and I love you guy’s
Blah bIah blah...
I thought 💭 we were gonna hear a death 💀
Everyone in the comments is being a dick, but if he didn’t make a video about it, they’d be pissed too
It’s not that serious Jeffrey. You’re loaded. People are dying. Goodnight ma’am
BYE
I don’t care
wtf bro you got me all excited you were gonna leave lol
istg if u don't just speak and stop w all this extra noise
thank yall for commenting what this was about. 11 minutes of deep breathing isnt what i technically wanted
Am I the only one who thinks this video is acceptable;e? like everyone is making fun of him, but I think is just making a video explaining to his viewers how important people in his life are leaving to build themselves. I mean there is clickbait and the video could of been shorter, but I like how he explains these things. Chris and Maddi have been a big part of life for years and I see no problem with him expressing and acknowledging it.
After watching this video I got the “What we learned” vibe. Lol
YEA UM, OK!!! JEFFREY IT'S GONNA GET BETTER BITCH!!
Absolute state of a human being 🤣
K goodbye
bye
The way he started by adjusting the camera is how every youtuber apology vidoe starts
Wow
Yikes this comment section has absolutely no love for Jeffree I feel like every video it gets worse and worse and worse 🙄😬
Dilate
You’re really not a good person so please actually delete all social media and Ferment in your own toxicity. I can tell as time goes by you just get nastier and more corrupt. And stop acting like you actually care ab other people bc we all know it’s fake and to keep your followers.
he’s not the same at all since him and Nate broke up.
????????
Clickbait ass
Jeffrees feet are nasty
Vapid
What a disappointing title.. almost hoped you decided to quit doing What you do...i knew i shouldnt have watched 😒
Great I’ll send my Resume
Please leave YouTube :)
Trash 🤣 really can’t get views unless you clickbait with random bullshit or having a drama go on
please call shane and tell him to come tf back!!
LMAOO
UGH NO I WAS RLLY HOPING YOU WERE DELETING THE CHANNEL🙄
oh so now he wants to say goodbye really he loves drama and he's fake for money don't think a lot of people will miss him.
Oh wait, there is no Hi, how are ya?       It must be serious, na, just multi- millionare problems.  Nothing to see here.
The comment section saved 11:24 minutes of my life
Can’t relate. We know the true tea sis. You put your paws where you shouldn’t have.
ok goodbye
Oh my God it’s so hard to set a camera up on a tripod isn’t it Jeffree? 🙄🙄🙄
I think you should just focus solely on makeup. That's your career. Not drama. People are having problems with you and honestly I dont really keep up with you that much but whenever you get into trouble with others it seems to make people look at you in a negative way. Like sure, collaborate with others or whatever but just keep your drama off the internet. I dont understand why any stars feel the need to share anything personal. Like ok some creeps like to know every detail about you from who you're dating to the colour of your eyes. But this isnt a freaking talk show. No one likes  "apology" videos. No one likes it when you call whoever a whore. I dont know what you're saying to the people close to you, but it's clearly a problem and its causing people to dislike you. I dont know or care if you even see this or read comments because I think I've seen you "get away from media" and get rid of other problematic people in your life before so you are clearly just in a cycle. This bullshit doesnt stop. Maybe it's just who you are.
bye ugly
IMAO GOOD BYE
We’re not saying goodbye to you and that’s super disappointing
I love the parent dog relationship ❤️   I just moved to California from NY 3 weeks ago..HUGE change and all my people are gone to 🥺 my husband is in the airforce so It’s lonely BUT I am a cosmetologist and I have no friends 😅 intentionally honestly. I don’t trust anyone either 😬
And Hanford and Northern Cali. And all over random places within. I would love to start my own private communities one day. Permaculture Paradise VV. I’m an induced Aquarius ya know water is my thing too.
I care and I’m more ground level oversight of permaculture but best wishes to your ranch and you. I was a Palmdale girl.
Why is this a thing
J. His.  S.j
How did u like the snow storm y'all got?
Puppy update video please! 🙏🏽🙏🏽🐶🐶
Oh my god dude when I saw that title I was so happy and you got my hopes up 😢
A biological man, who trying to live like a woman and to be a woman... ...good luck with that.
Yesss finally omg!
Warum bist du so ekelhaft
🙄 was hoping you were leaving
UGH... At least we know people really want him to leave, I mean compare the amount of views on this one vs the other stupid ones he has hahaha. Hopefully he will leave next!!
Atleast hes saying goodbye most bosses dont give a F if you go
Are you a guy?
Saying goodbye to his camera guy.  ##STOPCLICKBAIT
"I've never done this before" liar until the now??? lol 🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🥴🥴🥴🥴
Bro you’re always doing your damn fake ass breathing
The industry is starting to pick up again. It’s definitely something different. Best of luck to them.
Is this a boy
I want to be your personal assistant Jeffrey please hire me ❤️
This somehow feels faker yet also more meaningful than his break-up video.
And every drama channel "TEA!!!!!!" ...Yeah no lol
You don’t have to give hate to another person. There is no point just mind your own business and if you want to watch the video do if you don’t don’t. Everyone is a human being and the fact that someone has worst problem doesn’t cancel his. But Jeffery, be respectful.
Why not set the camera down before you start filming?
What's with sighs!
Is this going to be like nikocado avocado? we get a video each week "quitting youtube", "bye youtube" but actually he just makes even more videos xD
Ok
He had us all at "goodbye " ...
Hi jeffree can I be 1 of your lucky fan and customer to get 1 of your give aways please!!
All these people wishing he would leave YouTube... yet y’all still keep watching him🤔
😊♥️
cringe
Thank god!!!
I thought you were leaving - disappointing  much!
I of course watched the whole thing. I love you sm!! 🙏☀️
CLICK BAIT: his camera man is leaving he is not leaving YouTube, don’t wait 11 min on this
Would’ve been better if Jeff the star left instead
Okej?
I just wanted to watch the dogs playing!
Hi gay😂
Lol you suck get to the point
nobody cares, your rudeness has no line account #FREEBRITNEY

ewwwwww
Why is he loosing folowers?? 😭😭😭
Click baited
Clickbait. This is what the world become. Sad.
I was about to say “as u should queen” 🥲
The negativity and hate in this comment section is really disturbing. Self reflect.
Am I the only one watching the dogs instead of jeffre
Jeffrey....I need a video on chest and body makeup. What do I buy? No one could do it right but you. Give us that expertise w approved products.  Body oddy oddy!
Lol, ok?
Love the hair
So...you're not leaving. All excited for nothing.
Bye ✋
Damn even your assistant quit on you...
People got problems
Bye click bait
Disappointment your not leaving wth
People are dying, Kim.
All I can focus on is the 4 cracked  out dogs in the back 😂
WHY IS HE SIGHING AND OUT OF BREATHE SO MUCH

Who else got brought here cause you searched about that beer I owe ya?
Clickbait much? 🙄
While your here can you do a review on Charlotte  Airbrush flawless setting spray ?
I was just watching the puppy the whole time
👁👄👁
the greatest news ever! ⬇️  In the very beginning of time God created all & it was good, His plan was to have Him & His creation live in utopia. the satan deceived God’s creation so that wouldn’t happen, we choose evil. Evil has its consequences, death & hell separation from God for eternity is the consequence for disobeying an everlasting God. God doesn’t want that for any of His creation so He sent His Son Jesus(God in the flesh) & Jesus lived the perfect life. Died the death as a criminal, & resurrected, all so that we could have eternal life if we have faith in His beautiful sacrifice. This is God’s plan!
damn everyone in the comments don’t seem like fans? why comment then? i got so confused reading the comments before watching cause i was expecting support😂
Honestly I’m graduating in a few months and have wanted to experience being in pr and being an assistant, so if you ever see this Jeffree I’d so love to intern with you just to get a feel and I will give it my all 100%
Bye
i taught that she is leavin youtube for a sec😂
Repent
And there you go, a sad sad man all alone in his huge house with too many things and lots of tiny dogs.
yo they hairy
to everyone that saying "oh so sorry jeffery that you have to hold your own camera" and being negative, he's saying goodbye to people that been in his life for a long. stop fucking hating.

Typical. Create your own drama for relevance and sales, most of it fake, Nate's probably still in the background of these videos. Show off your lavish lifestyle and shopping sprees in the midst of a pandemic when the ppl who made you rich don't know how they're going to pay their bill's. Make these ridiculous videos like you got real problems than act like a victim when you bring it all upon yourself. ME ME ME ME ME
this old man crazy nobody caressssss lmao
why is everybody hating like take that negatively somewhere else or keep it to you self. Jeffery is talking about personal shit and saying goodbye to friends, people that been in his life for a long time. KEEP THAT NEGATIVELY TO YOURSELF, GO FUCKING MEDITATE AND LEAVE JEFFERY ALONE
Not me reading the title and saying “ ugh finally “
A bit dramatic. Is it possible there's more to it because Jeffree is trying so hard to make it seem like there isn't?
Not many people even like this  Freek anymore hahahahaha
It took him 11 minutes and 24 seconds just to say his camera man and assistant left- I could of gone to the corner store and buy some icecream during that time
there are two types of trolls paid and unpaid. The freebie trolls are very interesting to the un spirits of night or the golden spirits of light. Mirror. Do as thou wilt.
Trash
this man be looking and living like a mob boss and I love it
He’s loosing everything now
at the begining i was like "sister...are you leaveing YT *CRYS*
Where did all the other comments go? Lol
I would love it Ms Jefferee if you could make vids just chatting, chewing the fat so to speak on your internet site.  (Don't do twitter, instagram   and avoid mobile phones) Sick of seeing all the hate stuff every time I check if you have posted something. Sorry for all the drama in your life and very happy that you are still rich, healthy, gorgeous in your  kingdom of little doggies, cars and handbags. It really made my day back in the time before this new world stuff when you had a laff, went out and about, as  did many of us .  Saving for the blusher pack  -regards
You look so beautiful Jeffree and you’re glowing ❤️❤️❤️
Where can I apply. I’m a videographer
seems like you’re saying goodbye to all the people in your life,  even the ones who get paid to be around 🤷🏻‍♀️ just my opinion...
Everyone is literally leaving this guy. Wonder whyyyyyyyyyyyy
NOT ME THINKING HE WAS LEAVING 😭😭😭 whyyyy notttt
For someone who claims to hate relevancy, you sure love clinging to it
What is this guy about? OMG
He would never leave he needs the validation
what's this crap about?
So his camera man is leaving? Dammit I had my hopes up!
Tell me you're "EXTRAAA" without telling me you're extra.
...... yea no bye this is dumb
I was paying more attention to the dogs than what he was saying- welp😂
kAnYe's coming to be the camera man?!!
Bye Felicia
damn i was hoping he was finally leaving youtube
Damn, if only I had the problems of a millionaire instead of worrying if I can pay my mortgage! I'm so shallow to worry about these little things when your CAMERA MAN quit?! Hope you can make it through, king. Must be really fucking hard for you, gosh.
Does Jeffrey really think this bow hair-do thing looks good? 😱 I think he actually does!Yikes 😬
Hunty you must be desperate with clickbait like this 🙄
Didn’t your momma teach you to keep your legs closed in dresses, skirts or robes 🤨
The puppies in the background made it worth
So much hate in here, but y’all still contributing to his view counts which means more moola for Jeff lol
it’s the hair for me 🥴
this would be more believable if they sat down with Jeffrey and talked about the good times and how they had mutual respect for each other. if these people had been in your life for years you think they would be happy to spend half an hour sitting down and telling us about their new projects. From the outside looking in it looks like two people probably have had it..officially.. with MsJStarr
Click bait b.s I can't even watch these videos anymore because the fakenss has gotten so rediculous
You’re actually DISGUSTING. How are you going to have a public gathering and PROMOTE NOT WEARING A MASK?! There’s a PANDEMIC! I used to be a fan of yours but I absolutely cannot stand by and watch you put other people’s health, (YOUR FANS HEALTH) at risk. Absolutely disgusting behavior and you should be ashamed and held accountable.
God its time for YOU to move on and leave youtube....you wouldnt be anything without your lies and gas lighting...ugh fake as f sis
This video is wack is fuck, I honestly cant believe people watch this garbage. Im still confused how it got so rich off make up. I could finish watchin this but wish i could get those 10 secs back.
Nvm - I guess the rat ain’t leavi g
You guys are saying that he's being dramatic about his camera man leaving when hes been there thru thick and thin with jeffree. So in other words his camera man was more more real, than half of yalls boobs and lips. If one of my best friends had to go I would be sad too see them go. Also for those of you complaining because he is upset to see a friend go while you can't pay your bills that is irrelevant to his life. You are broke because of yourself. You don't have a job because of yourself stop making excuses to hate on someone else because you are misserable.
I got to 2:16 before I just paused and read the comments lmfao, what about yall
OK PLEASEEE what is the deal with Chris? He’s married to Jkissa? But jkissa and jeferee don’t get along? Ahhh what’s going on
How is this 11 minutes 😳
Enough with all the Sharon Stone moments ...
To everyone who spoiled the video I love you bb have a good night. Saved me 11 minutes ❤
The ONLY reason i clicked on this clickbait ass video was bc i thought jeffree was FINALLY quitting. But thanks to the beautiful commenters that told me it's just his camera man quitting JS, i didn't have to watch more than one second. Thanks y'all
We all have problems and they levels are different so guys just quit laughing at her we all deal with stress and pain are different way so do not hold her on it so sorry for who ever that can pay his bills or see he or she family member but she said it is her dear friend so it is have some compassion and stay bless
bad person
All darkness, that’s for sure.
I bought my very first pallet!!!! I got the blood sugar and conspiracy ( don't hurt me I'm broke🤣)  and free concealer!!! I'M SO EXCITED TO PLAY WITH IT💕💕💕💕💕
Good bye
I don't understand why people can't find anything better to do than get behind a keyboard and type hateful comments.... especially after all the death and horrible things that have happened in the past year. Haven't you learned there's more to life than stupid crap like that?! If you don't like Jeffree that's your right...go elsewhere. Don't spew your hate. Life is too damn short!!!
YES HE'S QUITTING   Edit:bruh only his camera man is 😐
Wow.. This was very disappointing
every 10 seconds: HooOOuHhhsS hOOoUsHhh
DONATELLA NESTING IN THE BACK IS EVERYTHING!!!XOXO
It's really amazing how jeffree can can put himself out there, I mean I have trubble just talking in public or even wearing a swimsuit. He is able to tell people about his life and share is deepest and darkest secrets to 16.6 million people. People are always so focoused on digging up dirt on him before they even take a look at themselfs and see their flaws. So I am sooo thankful that we have people with him to show us courage.
Does anyone give a shit of who's leaving 😂😂😂
AWWWW CUTEST DOGS EVER XOXO
Your awesome  jeffree
Bye!
god is good🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿‼️
Everyone in the comments:  "hes not leaving youtube his camera man and assistant are leaving"  Me:  *kissy noises* you set my soul on fire
Could’ve been a tweet
Damn, these comments are going in... 😅
Jeffree you know damn well everyone clicking on this video hoping you get off/leaving YouTube
CLICK BAIT WHERE’S THE T
What a drama queen 👸
"More darkness, more anxiety" ... So business as usual for Jeffree.  This meeting could have been an email .... In fact, this meeting could have been a tweet
yawn
Dogs are more interesting, take the camera and film them, GIRL
I hope you film the complete look of the renovation for your mansion when it is done.... Please so want to see it...
I’ve never done this before lol??  Ever thought I’d hear that come Out of his mouth
he spelled everyone wrong in his bio.
I really thought this video was going to be about you cutting your hair off lol.
The pandemic has chosen for everyone not you. Your an awful person. People who buy your crap are crazy. Latinos don't give this it any money. Cancel it. Bye!
Damn, kinda wish he'd leave too
i thought he was leaving- but it ws his camera man-
Clickbait ugh
how did I get to this? Is this a joke channel ? Chris has moved on... got a life     oh no.......
I only came here for the clickbait but... for all the videos I had seen of Jeffree including his guest appearances (before I dropped him) I can say with certainy that Chris leaving did affect him. For a moment I was thinking maybe Jeffree was truly a psychopath because he just doesn't show emotions dawg  And I mean he is not crying here but you can tell it did affect him.
Lovely dogs Im in love 😍😍😍😍
Does Andrew Siwiki have time on his hands to come help you out?!?  I think he’d be awesome!!!
Hang it up, flat screen
I was gonna comment "Good riddance" until I found out it was clickbait. Didn't watch a single second of this video.
Too long to watch. So who died this time? His gold fish, pet ant, or maybe he lost his favourite eyelash....
I would move to LA or Wyoming to work for you lol. Sounds like a fun experience. (:
Am I the only one who got distracted by the dogs? 😂
Jeffree be like "Covid who?" 🤦🏻‍♀️😂
Just drop the hair nails makeup overdecorated environment and retain two dogs at most. Find yourself without all that stuff.
A lot of people in your life right now are starting new chapters right now aren’t they?
I loved Chris and I love his wife! I hope they have an amazing journey! You'll be okay and I'm sure you'll find someone!
Just from him not even setting up his camera to put emphasis on not having a cameraman and just tweeting and being so overly dramatic just shows how he knew what he was doing with this video. But i think he can see that we all clicked because we wanted him to leave YouTube. Like good-bye ✋
Goodbye you freak!
Saying Goodbye  Meanwhile: me watching the dogs    👁👄👁❤❤❤
I will literally drop out of college to be your assistant
March 18th: Currently sitting at 119K likes, 40K dislikes. Eventually he'll turn the ratio off.
Get off YouTube, you don't deserve your platform.
Hello kitty looks different
WAIT didn’t his assistant live with him and spend every second of every day with him? It’s kind of weird how he’s under cutting how important that is.  I mean that’s kind of shady  Not trying to say anything ... just that I don’t know with everything else going on man I don’t know...  Why didn’t she say anything about it?  Omfg I just checked they arnt friends on socials anymore!!  Maybe it’s for her new jobs cause Jeffery is a big drama right now...  I donno man...  Eh
Why everyone hating on jeffree all of all of a sudden? I'm out of the loop
“The reason why I turned the camera on by myself” 🙄
https://youtu.be/LDZX4ooRsWs
not him putting “evereyone” in the description box🙈   also those dogs sound like rats yappin in the back 🤢
guys please stop saying you were hoping he was leaving youtube...  I cant like all the comments, theres too many.
Who cares about your shallow, pathetic, meaningless and miserable life, Voldemort?
disgsting...
Jeffree, "friends come and go" but.... don't let it bother you, CAUSE YOU ARE A STAR AFTER ALL, and according to my opinnion a new and more amazing stage in your life will be opening for you. I've read soo many of your blogs when MySpace was trendy YOU ACTUALLY have some briliant ideas which amazed me and I saw you have talent at writting, and I think it wouldn't be a bad idea to write a book, I would DEFINETLY BE one of those to purchase your book! ❤️
So he ain't leaving... damnit!! Welp, there's always next time...
If Donald Trump was a washed-up scene kid
GIGA CRINGE "i've never done this before"
I was too busy looking at the doggies 🐶🤷‍♀️
You can really just tell that the majority if its views are all coming from drama that its involved in.
Wish he would go away for good 🙄🙄 He is drama. Always has issues with someone and blames the other person and blackmails people.
Bye! We never wanted you in the first place lmao.
JEFFREE CAN YOU PLEASE TELL LPUIS VUITTON TO STOP MESSING WITH EXOTIC ANIMALS. LIKE SNAKES FOR THEIR DAMNED HANDBAGS?
Bye sister
Anyone else distracted by the pups the whole time??😂😅
Jeffree you got this I love you 🖤🖤
Seriously
He’s so cringy
Oh 💩
how bout u pack ur bags and leave too??
i was happy but then it was his camera man 😐
Dammit. So close.
It’s honestly so sad how y’all hate on Jeffrey, he’s literally a person like us. He felt the need to make this video to address this Bec the drama channels were putting his business out so he’s killing the drama before their is any. I love Jeffrey always will
gotta acknowledge the Scorpio drama in anything :)
Just let it all out girl we are here to support you. Dream big.
Not me being happy thinking HE would leave
Bye felicia! ...I meant bye Jeffrey
people need to remember jeffree is a human too we all make mistakes
The hair is what’s actually catching my attention tbh 😭😭💛💛
I don't care it your videos are long since it makes us( You're fan's) feel like we are actually talking to you in person and connecting with us
Bye
You can hire me if you really need it
Jeffrey’s hair style, makes me think of what Melanie Martinez + Sia official collaboration would look like 🤌
The time has come
For those who shop on amazon There is a donation site for it its called amazon smile everything is the same you dont pay more either, your just contributing what you payed for to a charity of your choice. I personally donate to Blue Ocean Society for Marine Conservation, Inc.
Use camera  hold
Jeffree is the definition of a liar
Jeffrey Lynne We still love you, tell the haters to go F**k themselves, literally. Can’t stand them bringing you down, keep being fabulous xx 🧡🧡🧡
He gave me a mini heart attack seeing the title of the video. I thought he was leaving youtube-
finally
Ugh I thought you were leaving YouTube and I got so excited
FINALLY
If Jeffrey Star does not lie,make a ton of DRAMA or do a ton a sh*t he will click bait...😐😑😕
it’s about time
I must say how genius the cremated pallet is, I  grab it and it like combines with all my other jefree pallets 😊💜in impressed
I’ll be your new camera (wo)man 🤷🏼‍♀️
Bruh can we turn off the internet for this guy
Love you
About fucking time
Awe. Look at the babies. I love them. Good luck
Who else is sick of Jeffree?

Clickbait
People close to Jeffree: *leaving*  Jeffree stans: “oMg Hes SoOoO uNpRoBlEmAtIc!!!”
Yay ..I love wyoming..😍
Lord Jesus have mercy on us, lost needing salvation and direction-Amen.
Awww pour little baby is sad cause he cant pay people to be around him🥺🥺😭
Its so heartbreaking to hear the hurt ....... you gonna be ok
Dang it I came to their video to see if you were going to leave I was severely disappointed
That's what the devil would look like in 2021..   People.. Wake tf up!
Praying for it
Thank you for the comments, I didn’t have waste another second watching a literal troll
Hi please do insta
Let the camera man stay and let jeffree leave
Waste of time
Its nice to be grateful for the crew but this is jist clickbait... 🙃
don’t forget to hit dislike!
❤️
Thank you so much for saving my 11 minute 23 seconds
Lol "I've never done this before"... As he is consistently making selfie videos on Instagram. 😄
Why tf can i smell his stanky breath
Click bait.  His camera men are leaving.  Thought it was him.  Its not.  crap.
The puppy eyes in the thumbnail 🥱🙄
what a nasty drag queen
Should've read the comments before watching this, HALF WAY THROUGH 🤨😥
I love how i searched up buzzfeed unsolved supernatural and this showed up
Let the man make a video, the fuck? Why are some of y'all so pressed. Sure, it could've been shorter but chile.
Saying goodbye... and saying hello! :)
Damn you really made it sound like YOU were leaving 🙄 bruh
You made more money off of two people losing their jobs.   Wonderful Jeffrey, just wonderful 👏🏻 😐
Script: deeply exhale every ten seconds
twitter sjw's are so insufferable and nasty, subscribed to jeffree solely because of his "cancelling".  jesus christ move on.
🤮🤮🤮🤮
Could have just tweeted about it instead, Jeremee
I am sad 😢 love you Jeffreey no matter what
so you’re not leaving...
bruh not me thinking jeffery was finally gonna leave ;_;    so close, oh so close
I am curious why those of you who are making such negative comments invest the time. I personally do not comment negatively because I DO NOT WATCH something or someone I do not like!
She’s not leaving.
y’all are still giving this piece of shit views? I just clicked on this bc it has 4.2 million.
@GIANNAXHASSAN !!!!!!!!!!
@GIANNAXHASSAN !!!!!!!
@GIANNAXHASSAN !!!!! Tik TOK PLEASE FOLLOW EVERYONE
Ok you overreacted way too much  I was sooo fucking happy after hearing that you were finally saying goodbye.. but sadly no ur cameramen and assistant is leaving   People just don’t waste ur time watching this video instead watch a james charles video...
I don't have money
For all of y'all talking mean about him being sad to say goodbye to the people he worked with: why? Why is it over the top for him to appreciate the people he has worked with? He worked with dude for over 5 years! That is huge, that is a huge goodbye, especially for a friend. It's always sad to say goodbye to someone, even if it may not be permanent, but to go from seeing someone ALL the time over 5 years to suddenly they're gone somewhere else, it is sad. And very hard. And for those of us that actually do care about human beings other than what society deems as a celebrity, we are glad Jeffrey told us what is going on behind the scenes. The people backstage are just as important, if not more sometimes, because of the hard work they put in.  I appreciate this goodbye. I don't think it should be so heavily critisized.
Why is everyone being so hateful?
Take me😊😊😊, to clean tour house, at least🥺🥺🥺🥺😩😩😩or anyway
Maybe not enough rise wage😩😩?
Bye
ewww i will never open any video you posted next time disgusting
Do us a favor and Disappear off the internet
Could a person be more fake? I dont think so
Lol
Jeffree whatever happened to the march mystery boxes?
you should say goodbye to youtube oh my god WHEN WILL YOU LEAVE YOU BROWLESS SIRENHEAD
Waiting for some YouTuber to do a sigh counter
Dang got my hopes up
So fake and weird and disjointed. 🤡🤡🤡
success comes with changes. life is hard but u are harder jeffree i love you, never give up.
Lmao i clicked on the video then paused it during the ad before the video started and flew to the comments 🤣
Please.be. kind. That  Includes. To. Jeffree.......CANCEL CULTURE IS FUCKING WRONG.
People...be kind. Jeffrey is a HUMAN. Even if you were to know him PERSONALLY...Let he who has no sin CAST the first stone....let him be sad. His friend isnt gonna be near him anymore! Stay strong, Jeffree! I know change is hard and just be the best, most kind and loving person you can be. God Bless YOU! I'm loving the hair! It is hard to trust people. I have been there too. I'm sorry if you're feeling lonely! Never give up. All my love, S.

What's the benefit on watching this shit.. people making money out of shit.
The clickbayt thing is so lame... Don't put my hopes up for nothing!
Please my dude.. you are a man its not something you choose.. you look like a woman, maybe you define yourself as a man but seriously! I am not better than you, yes i am a believer on Jesus, the God man who lived among us a perfect life, sinless, full of mercy, grace and truth. I have struggled many years of  my life in many lusts so i know what i am writing about. The bible and Jesus is the truth, like it or not. I hated it. I wanted to keep partying and watching porn and have affairs with women. God met me. He showed my sinning. I was on the broadway to hell, i got convicted of my sins. I asked for forgiveness, i repented, got born again through Gods Holy Spirit. I quit with the help from Jesus porn. And am now free from masturbation, which in fact, isnt normal. We are not created as animals following our instincts. Feelings are many times wrong. If i feel im a woman, i am a man, but if i suddenly would feel like im a woman, i would look downstairs and see a penis, not a vagina. Women get pregnant, men don't. Simple? Yes. Do people care? The fact is, we people like to live our own lives without rules, without God. I get it. I was one of those too. But if we humans don't return to God and believe on his precious, lovely and marvellous son. We will get the eternal seperation, which is eternal fire and shame from an Good and Holy God. Lets read the bible, believe it, ask God in prayer, he will answer.  Thanks :)
ugly
Praying you'll find someone to help you,  keep your head up.  We all miss you,  and luv you!
I FUXXKING LOOOOOOOVE YOUUUU JEFFREE STAR ⭐️💗
clickbait *
5:24  Dogs in the background behind jeffree: *FIGHTT*
Oh. What have you come as?
JUST GET OFF GODDAMN IT
All I did was search "Morris Dancing Old Men" and this shlt came up - Go home YouTube you're drunk.
thanks comments, saved me from having to waste my time watching this video :)
Well we kinda have a clue on why everyone is leaving😉😉😉
Hot damn can he please also leave? Like we don’t need his energy here and would’ve been giving us a favour if he actually leaves. Ugh
These people don't understand real problems. I've been through it, and I've seen it. This petty shit doesn't compare
Well. I don't regret reading comments before watching
We need a Jeffree vlogs his own life series !!
I’m in love with your bath robe! It’s sweet u are giving a farewell to Chris :) I wish both of u well.
Hello , "Afghan hound"  Check Meatcanyon btw :)

No congrats or well wishes for him its literally me me me I I I this video would have been better if he was leaving YouTube too all this click bait 🚮
Could have saved every drop of that I got all excited like this foolery was coming to an end
Ignore these haters Jeffree. If any one of these people making their hate comments about you ran into you, they would be all..."OMG!!! ITS JEFFREE STAR!!!! OMG!! PLEASE TAKE A PIC WITH ME!!! I LOVE YOU JEFFREE" True story. Just keep on keeping on Jeffree, be you. Period. Love you! I wish you could come to Florida. My daughter's 💕 you🙂
Nice you let the most important people go; that is devastating in its own right.
Oh.
You really shouldn't get people 's hopes up with clickbait titles
until

Its hard to concentrate on what you are saying, with all those cute little doggies behind you🐶🐶🐶🐶🐶 honestly..they are so stinking adorable. And more interesting..lol.
jeffere every 5 videos: "Goodbye" The Video: "I finished my $5,000 sundae”
Jeffrey siendo Jeffrey
Bizarre
“A lot of bullying”
Lord Alton of Liverpool: Far More Needs to Be Done Lord Alton of Liverpool, a strong advocate for the bill, pointed out that the CCP is responsible for the ongoing human rights disasters in China.   “It is extraordinary that such things can happen in the 21st century, but they are happening. That is why we have to be vigilant and do what we can to prevent the exploitation of people who are caught up in these circumstances...We know that many dissidents—people who have spoken out against the regime—including lawyers, have been arrested, and some have disappeared, never to be seen again.”  “We also need to do far more about the phenomenon of people traveling to other parts of the world to take organs from others. That kind of organ tourism is something that the British Government needs to do more about.”  Baroness Finlay of Llandaff: the U.K Won’t Turn a Blind Eye to the Crime Baroness Finlay is the former president of the Royal Society of Medicine and current chairman of the Commonwealth Respect Life Project of the NHS. She introduced a bill in 2007 that successfully changed the UK government's policy on organ donation.  Baroness Finlay said during the debate that “Many of us have been concerned for some time about forced organ harvesting from prisoners of conscience. The amendment is a strong signal that the UK does not turn a blind eye, however uncomfortable facing the problem may be.”  She commended the passing of the bill and said at the end of her speech that “we welcome wholeheartedly what the Government has done and the very important signals that are now being sent to the rest of the world.”  Baroness Finlay expressed hope that the U.K. government will stand firm against the crimes of the CCP. Together with Lord Ribeiro and Lord Patel, the three of them with professional medical background are promoting awareness and calling for actions in the British medical and pharmaceutical community.  She said in the debate in House of Commons on February 11 that “many other tribunal witnesses underwent torture, blood tests and organ scans while in detention.”  She cited the specific case of a Falun Gong practitioner. She said, “Liu Yumei, an elderly Falun Gong practitioner, was originally arrested on December 31, 2000 in Beijing. Police officers threatened that if she did not give her name and address, they would take away her organs and her family would not find her corpse. She was severely tortured during her detention, shackled to a bed by her neck, sexually abused, electric shocked and force-fed urine mixed with rice and was forcibly blood tested by a prison doctor.”  She noted that records from NHS indicated 29 U.K. citizens have gone to China and received organ transplants there in the past 10 years. And between 1995 and 2012, another 22 people traveled from U.K. to China to receive kidneys, but no further information about the Chinese donors was given. She called on the government to pay attention to this and tackle the issue of transplant tourism.  She also urged the government to take vigilant actions on regulating export products that facilitate the CCP’s forced organ harvesting atrocities.
God loves you
I feel like a lot of people judge him without an explanation y’all act like he doesn’t Have feelings he feels like all of us
I know you're strong gurl🔥

Da fuq?!?! All this cause his camera guy quit?! Jeffree I know you're extra af, but this is extra even for you.
Who else is watching the dogs 🐕
and what about a new mansions tour.
Didn't want to monotize this with a view glad I hit the comments!
Jeffrey you are amazing & yes you will figure all of this out! Hugs & Prayers from Alberta, Canada  🇨🇦  You got this girl!!
His dogs are the cutest little Pomeranians ❤️
Literally the only thing I was thinking during this while video was wtf is that dog doing 😂
Ok which of the dogs died this time
That hair tho...
Idk why everyone is hating his cameraman and Maddie have been people apart of his videos and his life and we know them and he’s right people start drama if he doesn’t address it. Chill tf out.
its the soft music in the background for me
Good riddance
i think it makes sense that this is an emotional moment. i imagine you get close with people you work with especially in a setting like show business. so big changes can be hard, especially if it’s a change involving someone with which trust has been built and maintained.
His views on this video lol jeffree is really going downhill
Read the comments and placed on 2x the speed.
Why do people care about this crap? There are way more important things going on in the World. Gain some substance.
Clickbait.
NOOOO SO SADDD://////
okay everyone is mad about the name of it but seeing him actually care about these people that worked for him definitely says something about him as a human in my eyes... not a lot of these celebrities really care about their employees in the way he seems to!
I wish I could help! Everyone is grown and gone from my life 🥺
I’m really gonna miss you I grew up watching your videos you were the first person that get to learn how to use make up for the first time my life
I honestly watched the puppies the whole time 😍🐶
Im so proud of you  >>>>
we have a rich person saying thank you to us plebs just for watching and our response is snide remarks and how no one gives a single piece of dog shit about anything more than watching the "talent" even though it's the people behind the scenes doing most of the work, not all but most and it always goes unrecognized unless some of the fans are either considerate (ultra rare) or just geeks/ nerds about behind the camera production.  wake up and smell the burning building you're in people!!! this here shows why the rich look down on anyone who isn't on their level and it's not entirely about money it is the concept of pack mentality and how we act as the discount goldfish in Petco to anyone who isn't personally close and then some.  edit: any richie can say thank you but this is more about how the "talent" is contributing to this concept, problem and contributes to making sure we don't stop acting like those discount Petco goldfish
I am moving to Wyoming soon! Is it nice?
Yes, this video is way longer than it needed to be. But y’all, he needed a clickbait title for them views, they’ve been a bit low lately 😩
I wonder why it’s assistance left? They were really close.
Where da hitman at
“*inhales sharply* there has been a lot of hard things happening right now, so many people are dying, covid has changed everything, and most importantly, my camera man left. i know guys, it’s sad.” 💀
jeffree star you should try florasis beauty # beautiful makeup 🏵🌺
Yeah address the sale on Shane’s Merck getting discounted?
What’s with this elevator music 😂
This is like me adding run on sentences to make my essay longer 😂😂
He's played out ,sorry but so tired 😫
Bye my camera man, I decided to make a 11 mins video so I can trick people into clicking this video and pay me tons
Oh shit I forgot Jeffree drama was a thing
Can someone summarize this?!  Too long to watch LOL
They left his ass lmao
Hummm
The best part of this video is watching the pups! 🥰😍🥰😍
Jeffree, you'll never remember me- we used to talk a lot in the MySpace days.  Keep your head up dude. Back then you were unfiltered and could actually go to your fans to share your pain and anger- get it out and 'feel better'... But, I know you have a hard time truly opening up to your fans now and days because anyone is looking for a shed of drama they can extort you for, for their 15 min of fame... But when I watch this, it's the first time in a loooong time I've seen you truly express your vulnerability and I really feel like this is cry for help. I know you're strong- but if you haven't heard it lately.... You're still doing amazing and it's totally astounding for how far you've come in this industry, in life and as a person... DO NOT forget that you have done so much, but girl.... You have so much more to give, experience, create and live for!   I know what it's like to be unable to trust people, and be burned by someone you thought you trusted. Even when you lose some of those trusted individuals in your life, it's so hard and seems like there is no silver lining. I've been so depressed and have never felt so alone in my life as I have this past year. But things will get better, they do get better and besides, how will I ever appreciate all that I have and have worked for if I never experience this shitty time?  Keep rockin queen!
My niece introduced me to your videos.  At first, it was WAY out of my comfort zone, but I have come to enjoy and look forward to them.  I believe all this change is making way for a WONDERFUL new chapter.  I am looking forward to what happens next.  Also, those dogs...so cute!
OMG filler says hi how are ya
Short answer:his video man is leaving
Man I thought she was about to say he died from covid
When people don’t even want to be around you even if they getting paid lmmfao #SAD
You probably won’t read this, I never enjoy watching your videos before but now you look and act different and I wish you well with a new camera guy and assistant, Covid has definitely made a huge impact but with all that you appear to be strong person and although you don’t trust many people I wish you well and hope you can encounter someone worthy. As I had in my hardest moment.
Jk
You're a literal menace to society. Give it a rest.
why on earth does he still have a platform. after what he did? that’s disgusting.
Good Riddance..😂
Keep fight jefree ..u can do anything and also many people support u..love so much from indonesia
Hi !! 🙋‍♀️
Not Donatella trying to kill the blanket when Jefferey is saying his goodbyes. 😂😩
I’m so glad this isn’t you leaving this platform. Like seriously. Most of my favorite creatures have been cancelled or just left on their own. So thank you. Love you and all you do.
This should have been an actual goodbye.
You're really so grateful, classy 🙏💗 and graceful.  Love your videos and you!
Repent and give your life to Christ 💞. The Bible says that Jesus is the way the truth and the life. Jesus is the only way to heaven. Trust in him and the fact that he died for your sins and you will receive the holy spirit. Then you will go to heaven to be with God and the rest of the other believers in Christ.💜

Well boo! I was hoping you were leaving, Jeffree. I’ll keep hoping 🤷🏻‍♀️🤞🏼
Zeffirelli
Nooooooo 😱😱😱😭😭
AYO HASLEY
yeah, please leave.
I like his
Clickbait
Can u plz talk about why u block ur assistant months ago on ur social media? N why u decided to do a car show viewing with no covid safety guidelines ??? Thx u🙏
Sounds like your doing some damage control before things blow up about these people 😂😂 THE STUNTS !!!!
Hello my fellow scorpio sistah gurl 💋
You are very strong and talented.  Thank you for everything you share with me. It helps me to be stronger too....😊  I read some of the other comments.  Jeffrey,  they are jealous of your strength and your changing world. Please ignore their rude comments. God's blessings will be with you because I ask him to bless all who are strong and help themselves while giving others help. You do that.......😊🙏😊
can some body tell me what gender jefferstar is if it dose not bug anyone to tell me
I assume the cameraman is leaving because there is hardly anything to film anymore. J* rarely ever uploads videos anymore because people stopped caring
Imagine being so toxic that you alienate everyone around you. No one can stand JeffreeStar and his ego.  He's alone because of his obnoxiousness and selfishness.
Ok then Byeee 😘😘
that fake laugh @0:51 tho 💀
Love you 💓😙
This could’ve been a tweet.
i abruptly stopped playing "ding dong the witch is dead" after reading the top comment
So much negativity in people, cherish the true ones!😘
Can’t wait for another give away hopefully I act fast enough
I love the look
Jeffree: super serious. Dogs: WWE Smackdown. 😂😂
the doggies are soo cuuute.
*sighs*
When the only thing in your life that sticks around is your money, but the people with any real value leave your fake ass behind...
K?? Bye?
I'd love to be your PA.
Say what you want about Jeffree, no matter if you love or hate him, no matter if it's good or bad, sincere or dramatic, he's always entertaining . We are always coming back to his channel to see what he's doing next , to see what he's going to do, or to see what drama he's in . He has  created this perfect bubble of publicity and that's genius . He was just a kid on MySpace now he is one of the most famous/infamous people on the Internet.
O mj hi
Thank God, please don’t come back.
Thank goodness your not leaving! I watch you all the time.
I hope you are able to find someone perfect to create many new videos and memories with soon! It's always hard saying goodbye to people who you have been close with for so long, even employees. I have fond memories of many people who I've met through work and none of them had been so close to me as your employees. Even though it is a job, you become family working with people so closely and create lasting bonds. So many friends of mine have been met through work and I'm so thankful for those friendships and memories 💓 I look forward to many more videos and adventures. I look forward to your future endeavors and meeting the new crew ❤
JUST GET THE HELL OUT OF YOUTUBE, MAYBE DO SOMETHING NICE FOR THE WORLD WITH YOHR MONEY. evil people
Please make an official leave you pathetic man
Just a random thought but, I think a theme for 2021 is loss
I thought he was  saying good buy to his social media burh this shit is nonsense 😤 just wasting my time for nonsense thanks for nothing 🙄🙄
fucking finally
"people are dying, pandemic, changes!..  fuck it all. my personal assistant is gone!"  DIZ
i’m scared i haven’t watched it yet
I know 2020 was a crazy time and I lost everything
Good riddance.
OMG PLEASE MAKE A SMOKE WITH ME VIDEO🍃🥰IT WOULD BE SO MUCH FUN
How about actually saying good bye
I can’t believe I supported Jeffree and Shane for so many years. Nobody is going to forget that they lied to try to destroy a 19 year old’s life and career out of jealousy.  It’s also kind of hilarious that the next video on auto play is James Charles lol.
this title and the actual content of the video are so fucked up. purposely misleading
Love you babe, but #cantrelate guess it’s time to learn how to work both sides of the camera 😉
Late night. Just Lost in YouTube. Bye
No, YOU’RE welcome!
I was hoping for some good news but I got this instead 👁👄👁🤚
KEEP, YOUR HEAD UP, DUDE.
I’ll be ur assistant! I would love that!
OMG LOVE THE BEARS :) LOVE THE BEARS LOVE THE BEARS LOVE THE BEARS   THERE SO FLUFFY IM GONA DIEEE
I´m applying for the job as personal assistance. @jeffreestar Where can i sign? :-)  insta: Sylvesterxtra
Bruh 🙄
Man, people have a lot of negative things to say. Jeffree, sorry a couple of doors have closed for you. Two more WILL open! Chin up, beautiful.
Now that there are job opportunities available....hey girl hey! Where do I send my resume?
Y’all we did it. Just take it in 😌
ok, a waste of time. your cameraman isn't good at all.
No body cares honestly
So we’re all just gonna ignore all the shit that came out about him a few weeks ago
omfg  he's not leaving 😔
He’s not leaving YouTube, his cameraman is leaving
damn, was about to celebrate you leaving...put the decorations away until we're free of you I guess
😳 🤦🏻‍♀️
so it took you 11 minutes and 24 seconds to say your camera man left... no wonder 🧐
What’s with all the crotch shots 🤣
Bye, don’t come back... please
Uh ha *sighs in rasism* urrrmm that’s all that happened
I'll sign a nondisclosure and video you anytime Queen!!!
You got my hopes up 😔 smh
Love the new look
I was worried your grandma died!
Like i get know it seems trivial guys, "oh man is this what you call a crisis? wow, if only i had this little stuff to worry about" but dude, these 2 people have been in his life for years, next to him everyday. Especially madi, that was his right hand woman, like your not gonna sit there and say your best friend that was with you everyday for years leaves and your not gonna be upset. like i get it i do
you already said your camera man was leaving in one of your cleaning/ moving out videos
Plz leave plz .......so i can die in peace
sweet.your fc#n amazing.
BAAAYYYYYYYEEEEE
Hope to see you on here soon again..stay strong sweetheart 😊
literally this so grossly over dramatic-
why the fuck is this in my recomendation
To save you giving him views and ad revenue he isn't leaving YouTube, his camera man is leaving, like we should all care about that during a pandemic 🤔
Queen, First of all, wow thank you for sharing and not letting the crown fall. Maybe a little tilted but still on. I love your positive atomistic personality. Change is difficult. I hope you find someone that you can trust in this life of haters and leeches. Thank you. I support you fullly and always always wish the best . People come and go but you make sure you stay a positive QUEEN. NOTHING WRONG WITH YOU and it would be a gift to be your personal assistance. BYE. Sincerely Fernie QUEEN
Why does everyone have to be so negative. If you don’t like Jeffree why watch stop being haters. A lot of y’all are dramatic over a dude leaving you after being with you for a month. Jeffree honey everything will fall in place keep your positive attitude and vibe. Love you
for some strange reason,  I hAve unreal intuition,  I feel like bcuz I'm changing my life, I have too Ive been drawn to where you live, as much as j want to go to AZ, but I have no life to pick up n hold me back..  I wish best for you, my fav person. too bad the rest of these arses can't be bothered but talk shite on your site.  be so honored to work, be part of your work!  A
you’d think if you had 16m subscribers you wouldn’t need to clickbait anymore
No matter what happens in your, or my life. I'll always be here to support you, your channel, company, and life. 🙏💯💗
You click bait you need to get tf off YouTube
Yall worried about jeffree not leaving but you're not gonna go and bash on james listen what he did in the past is the fucking past I'm freaking black but I forgave him for what he did yall just need to get over yourselves. He has had really no repeat and has done nothing wrong the last few years
No one cares yo
2 Corinthians 4:3-4 poor dude is blinded from the Truth. He is a Romans 1:18-32 and 2 Timothy 3:1-5
To sum it up: alot of people who work for him dont work for him anymore.
Love you J. S. but the title was misleading.
Why the hell are so many haters here. You don’t like Jeffree? BYE 👋
entire video be like “haaaah HEUH ho *sigh* hhhhhhhhhh uhhdjhmmmm FOOO fuhhjs hUHUH hhhehhha aaah fo huuh *inhale* kHAUhhKh”
wtf is wrong with YT algorithm, I searched for hideous-looking pokemon and they showed me this video. although this thing/creature looks terrifying
Talk about click bait.....
Why did I not even get a notification for this video. This is 2 videos in a row now that I’m not get notifications for. Not happy YouTube! 🤬
Just realized JS looks like Bella Thorne....
your looking a little grey  did you get that aids test someone else suggested thought i was seeing a results video.......worryed about you sweety
2020 kicked my ass 2021 looking about the frigging same.just roll with it baby
Welcome to the pink hair club it looks marvelous on you dear jefree 💟
"never done this before" like he cant remember filming MySpace and early youtube videos without a crew tf
BYE
Bie
Lol
Ok....................bye...............
I dont blame him for making videos I am just ashamed for still watching it
Big bravo to Chris for lasting that long 😅🙇🏼‍♀️
The thumbnail has me SHITTING MYSELFFFF😂😂😂🤣
awh I got my hopes up for nothing ;;
thought you were leaving yt, started celebrating :/
Everyone saying that their hard times and worse than his and then if you tell them "I'm going through a worst situation" they say thay we can't compare pains. Bro just shut up, if he's taking this like that and you do not like it leave the video, no one is forcing you to watch the video 🤷‍♀️
No
Saying goodbye...to the cameramen
TLDR: He's moving to Kanye's ranch in Wyoming
I thought he is saying “Goodbye “🙄
https://youtu.be/mZehUIuym8I
ok bye 🤣
I honestly still support him 100%
Guys really his best friend that is close to him he doesn't get to see him much any more when u have a true friend that u trust and they move on is emotionally hard so u don't feel what he feels so stop being hard on him
If you don't like him then why are you here leaving nasty comments? Don't be jealous cause of what he has, he earned every penny of it. This world has nothing but negative people. Let's stop the hating all the time and start loving each other. Everyone needs positive vibes...
Gosh, you’re Pathetic
My brain literally hurts
I tried to enter your drawing on Instagram but cause I am new to it I couldn't repost it on my page. I would love to work with you. You are an amazing person. I can travel, yes I have a husband but he could come with us. Love you. If you want to get rid of anything that you don't want please send it my way. Can not afford anything right now cause of this pandemic. Getting ready to lose my apartment cause my boyfriend lost his job. Keep making videos. Love you
What is this thang in front of me 🤮
His camera man quit. That’s it
I find it ironic that these celebs know there states are messed up. Not allowing people to the right to get back to work and a normal life. they decide to run to Republican states to vacation interesting🙄🤔
Imagine being a youtuber with 16M subs and having never filmed yourself before 😒
I'm just waiting for the day where someone else's problems will not be considered any less valid just because you are experiencing something different or worse. It's not a competition and everyone is allowed to feel bad for whatever reason.
I Volunteer my camera skills. I work cheap, I just have to bring my nieces. LOL
I’ve never done this before....what set up your effing camera? Get over yourself.
BYE! GET OFF THE INTERNET....
We love you !!!! You're super strong !
16 mil subscribers and still using clickbait?
Finally
Uhhh click bait muuuuuch!!
Skip to 1:20 if you don’t want to hear him stalling 🙄
https://youtu.be/Loe5-GWtqpM
duuuude your robe is way too high up i’m getting nervous
I suppose his YouTube censors also quit. Good to finally see some negative comments.
to not waste your time, basically what happened was his camera man and personal assistant left
*CORRECTIONS*  Has JS disclosed he is selling JSC products in TJ Maxx and Marshall's? It's true.   Wonder if this is why he began cringe-worthingly pitching JSC products like a guest host on QVC, HSN; and late-night commercials.  Has had 50% off of quite a bit of JSC products - except for the "newer" (aka REPACKAGED) edition of his old and poorer quality products - at the JSC website.  No more bougie make-up reviews and/or tutorials; except his LAST JSC palette - which looks like a mass ditch of warehoused products repackaged.  He bought a house/ranch in WY...  Jeffree and Kanye scandal...  Friendships ending... What happened to/with "Lipstick Nick;" has she bailed, too?  Seems unusually short and snappy at his furbabies.  Bet his ridiculously outrageous CA mansion has been or will be listed for sale.  Looks and sounds like rats jumping a sinking ship.  "...still no nails" is the least of his problems.  I have a feeling he's running away from some serious illegal issues. I wonder if he's trying to avoid prosecution by moving to another State and changing his legal residency.  He's always been openly catty and shady.  Perhaps karma is at his heels.  KARMA (noun) "In Hinduism and Buddhism, karma is the sum of a person's actions in this and previous states of existence, viewed as deciding their fate in future existences." In short, the law of cause and effect: "You reap what you sow;" or, "What goes around, comes around."
The only time a camera man leaving requires a 10 minute video is the one from Maurey Povich
wish he was leaving youtube tbh
Will you go to lunch with me in  Cheyenne!!! 🌬💨🍁
My God, the drama with this guy. I don't know how people stand it. Yeah, cameraman leaving, assistant leaving, and that's all I can manage. I'm out.
I wish we were just saying good bye to u...
I have been watching u and Shane Dawson forever  you guys got this! Love u bitches💖 Goodluck to u both!!!!
Now can u ba a good dear and get away from youtube
Nice click bait, glad I read the comments
First time watching anything to do with his channel and the comments show me he's OTT and people are getting fed up with him
Eww not liking the tattoos at all. The rest yeah. Ok tattoos noooo
What the fuck ru
What's the name of the music playing in the background?
Wtf is this thing?
People would put up photos together, or a montage. This selfish fish just points the camera at himself because it’s all ME ME ME
Gay
Jeffree Star, just quit youtube already!
you are worsening.
So he's not going back to his home planet?
I thought he's Doja Cat😂
I got all excited, then realised it was just his camera man. Oh well. I suppose it was too good to be true. I’m the same age as JS and I cannot for the life in me work out why a grown ass man is so childish and cannot take responsibility for his own actions. Any tough times you’ve had this year, apart from the pandemic, is your own doing JS. Grow up.
What episode of LazyTown is this?
Mavafangul
He didn't do that much wrong, he titled his video saying goodbye he didn't say what too so you shouldn't be totally mad at him for your assumptions and it depends on if hes right or wrong about the drama part because its people who worked with him for awhile so idk for sure about that.
Just saying like...you can leave too if you want :)
bro don't be shy, just leave ❤️
LAME? Yes!!! 🤷🏻‍♀️
Okay the title is too dramatic
You got this! Breathe,  take a big sippy sip honey! Don't feel pressured by us. We got you boo!   Glad to see and, hear of all the great things going on. Remember not to overwork yourself.  Um, yes we are totally excited about some Mascara! Lol all good things in time.    I there may be and, have been rough times. You're doing great! #ICONIC!
*playback speed 2x
I can help take care of ya.
I live in Gillette, we are neighbors here in Wyoming. I can help fill in the gaps cuz I love you!!! And my life is transitioning too.
I am sure, there are hundreds of talented good people as options for You. They need a job, You need a dear assistant. Easy. Change is great! Learn to trust again... takes time and it is a careful process
it's crazy his videos used to have at least 10-20 million views easy now he has to do clickbait to get half those views
The people discrediting set crew people like the camera man and acting like he shouldn’t receive recognition for retiring from his position is what’s sad. 👌🏻 let Jeffree give the guitar player of his band the spot light for a second people 🙄 it’s not all about the lead singer.
Bye sister
TEEEEEEEAAA
Boring
Jesus Christ tf are you so dramatic for?!
As soon as I heard the mouth smacking I got out of this channel faster than a stripper collects her money.
Why 37k dislikes though?
He named his dog “dessert” like what he does to all his “friends@
You can do it ❤️
Anyone else here because that girl on tiktok exposed Jeffree about being jealous of Nathan?💀
No please leave lmfao
Too bad you couldn’t say bye to your disgusting wig boy! Yuck.
OMG I can see it again
A little more unforgiving???
Looking at the cute pups in this vid.  Looking at the cute pups.  Since I already know what is happening, I'm focusing on the cute pups.  I want to pet them.  Those sighs are quite distracting.  I would know how it'll be like doing yoga with Jeffree would be like suddenly.  Le Sigh.    Cute pups.  Pretty pups.  That is all.  I hope everyone is doing well.
Jeffree star stressing out of loosing his personal assistance and his camera man I’m stressing out because I can’t pay my bills lol
I thought you are leaving. Now im dissapointed 😐
So you're not actually leaving then? Bummer.
Why is he so dramatic?
Sounds like everyone quit on jeffree.
Jabar starfish
Inagine clickbaiting to pull 4 mill views when you use to average 4 times that😂 awe your channel is literally dying
Imagine if we all reported for spam
Oh, so he has rich people problems. Lol
Jabar starfish at it again🙄
oh no...     *anyway*
Yes the camera man left now lets act like the world is ending
Jeffree: *posts video with very dramatic title* Me: *checks comments first and saves a bunch of time*
Can I become your personal assistant?
.....WOW......
Bye Felicia. You should have left when Jenna left. On God.
Umm Jeffree, I’ll up & move & come do everything for you! Pick me! 🤚🏼🤚🏼🤚🏼
Let me be your personal assistant
The dogs are so darn adorable!
https://youtu.be/Na3uv4j63WM:
If you ever feel useless just remember that there are people who have subscribed to this channel
I’ll be your camera man and my twin will be your assistant 😍 🤪 We love you! Keep your head up Jeffree you’ll get through this. 😘
To be fair Sir pick up the camera and vlog like every other u tuber. U only come on here to sell yr Shiet or look what I bought. Next...
Man I sat here for nothing i though he was leaving 🥳 but no it was the camera man        😶🔫
Wow
I haven’t SHIT in the past 3 days
Came here thinking this clown was saying goodbye to YouTube.. damn
My eyes only focusing on Donatella idk why. She's adorable.
For anybody that sees this comment, God loves you and wants you to come closer to him. 🙏
thank you for scaring the living shit out of me
The amount of people who showed up to throw shade 😂😂😂😂😂
Me trying to reach the word count on my essay:
You’re a man, take that makeup off your face!
He reminds me of those stuck up girls at school who wouldn’t talk to anyone because they thought they were too good. He probably wouldn’t be friends with half of his fans.
When you die the real you( the spirit inside your body) either goes to Heaven or hell. Going to either path depends on if you accepted or you rejected Jesus Christ as the savior.  Heaven is a very good place with no sins, sorrows, crying, lust, greed; in other words there is no sin there and it’s full of joy.  Hell is very terrible and it’s very very hot, you can’t survive placing your hand on a hot stove for 10 seconds, don’t even think you will withstand burning there without being consumed, The thing here is you will be burned without being consumed in hell the same same way you boil a hard rock in water you will be there for eternity, Again after judgement you will be thrown in lake of fire forever. Matthew 13:50 (UKJV) “And shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.”   Realise that you deserve hell for your sins;  Romans 6:23 plainly states that the wages of sin is DEATH. In Genesis 2:17 God warned Adam and Eve that they would die THE DAY they ate of the forbidden fruit. They disobeyed God, but didn't DIE physically until hundreds of years later. Why? It's because they DIED SPIRITUALLY that awful day, and all mankind has been born spiritually dead since (Romans 5:12). Please understand that spiritual death and the second death are not the same. Every person who is not born again is ALREADY spiritually dead. The second death is Gehenna, i.e., the Lake of Fire (Revelation 20:11-15). All those who die in their sins, without being born again( that is believing that Jesus Christ got crucified and shed his blood for their sins, buried and rose again in the third day and alive now in heaven), will be arraigned, prosecuted, and sentenced at The Great White Throne of Judgment and then cast into the Lake of Fire forever.   So how to get salvation and be on your way to heaven?  First thing first; Believing at Jesus Christ does not involve worship of other gods(church leader&ancestors), object(hand bands,car stickers,trees e.t.c) Muhammad,buddha e.t.c. It's only believing at Christ as the perfect sacrifice for your sins. It's your choice but know that rejecting Jesus Christ will send you the wrong direction.  Hebrews 10:4, 10 For it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins. By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.   Any other form of sacrifice be it animal sacrifices it can't save you but we are only saved through the sacrifice of our Lord Jesus Christ.  No works can save you, there is no physical thing you can do to get saved but you are only saved through faith at what Jesus Christ did for you as simple as that.   Ephesians 2:8-9 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast.  Believe and confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ was crucified and he shed his blood for your sins at the cross and was buried but risen again on the third day and alive in heaven now, that way you will receive salvation and be on your way to heaven during rapture or after death.  After believing at Jesus Christ as the savior you must change your ways and try to stay away from bad works or sins as hard as possible, you must show that you are a new individual in Christ. e.g stopping fornication, getting drunk, homosexual acts, masturbation, pornography e.t.c.  Romans 6:10-11 For in that he died, he died unto sin once: but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God. Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord.  As a human you will still fall at some sins of course as no human is perfect, but you must not swim in sin you must try your best to fight against sins and live a righteous life.  Also grow in the word; I suggest the following YouTube channels; Real bible believers, Robert Breaker and Pastor J.D Farag..
Who dis why I find in my feed? Bye.
please leave
Clickbait. Super cap. 🤦🏻‍♂️
Review the Lisa Frank makeup!🙏🏻
Everybody keeps making these click bate good bye videos 🤪
I didn’t realize clicking on this that it was going to be Puppy Bowl 2021. BUT thank goodness it was because I would rather watch the dogs. I left my “cry me a river” violin in the other room.
That dogs has better hair than me 😅
im sorry but no one cares about your camera man dawg
bye<3
Honestly everyone have their own problems and it’s not comparable cuz everyone is in different situations. Take care Jeffree, hopefully see you in a new energy and great vibe.
What about you and Kanye West????
Damn I really got my hopes all up just for him to say his CAMERAMAN is leaving???
can he stop sighing for a damn minute god
byeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee   dont let the door hit u on the way outt :))
Come on people. If you don't want to see him, you can stop searching for him and block him everywhere. Easy right?
This is the most shallow human being I have ever seen
how is he at his age and still so theatrical in his behavior... I guess some never grow up
I am puzzled at what I am looking at and listening to.  I am not sure if this is supposed to be some sort of twisted meme or someone’s alternate reality, where it is perfectly normal (yea yea yea what ever that is) to be absurdly inked, weird hair, a voice deeper than Andre’The Giant, trying to act fem..... to top it off, his eye sockets are sunken in like some druggie on a three year trip.  If the dude is gay, okay, no problem.  If he is not a he but a she, then my apologies, but for real, there is a Lot going on here with this guy and it is confusing AF.
thank god
Clickbait title for 500, Alex.
Who gives a shit😒
he is fr hyping us up just to tell us his camera man left. while u got actually people suffering. but no you wanna get sad cause you don't know how to work the camera
I love you jeffree star 😍😍😍 ... from philippines
My God - what is wrong with this world and culture in general.
I don’t really care if he leaves
Is this thing a guy or a girl? If you say it's an alien i wouldn't be surprised.
Click Bait Much?
All for clicks. Seriously this is getting old
I never watch this trash. I only clicked because I had hope this weren't clickbait and the internet had bid him good riddance, but no--of course it's clickbait. I don't know why I thought it could possibly be anything else.
Queen please don't let them forget you
This is just rude
Jeffree: You guys i did it,  i said goodbye to my wee-wee🤏🏾😂🤦‍♀️
Today I saw your shaved head!!!!! Who called it first about a week or 2 ago Jeffree Lynn!!!!!???? I did baby!!! Love you Jeffree Always. Your biggest fan ❤❤❤
Jeffreestar i just wanna to say that i love how the way u 😂 laugh and whenever I’m sad i just go to ur yt page and u make me happy all the time!
Thanks for rejecting my app for Exec Admin to the CEO. It seems like J*C’s will be shut down soon, because how are you even shipping orders right now without breaking COVID-19 protocols? It just is impossible...
Jefreestar hunni u look a mess give up your makeup and be the real you I would love to see how natural you look underneath that nice mask you always wear don't let people get you down I use to wear makeup to hide my depression and my anxiety but it made me into a dangerous violent mess.
Awwwwww jeffree lynn we love you and are here for you!!! 🤍💜🌸🌼💕❤️💙 be careful with who you hire!
There is nothing money can buy so you can literally buy the best assistant and the best videographer buy me as a friend if you want hahaha
Everyone just wants him to quit youtube tho..
I thought you were leaving YouTube. I’m glad you’re not.  Would be a really nice  to work with Jeffree.  ☺️
Love you Bitch
I know you might not even see my comment but I got a dm from a Instagram account claiming for select winners for the giveaway to even enter people’s card info and stuff and figured you should be aware
Its hard for him because the camera person was part of his life for some time it must be hard for him because people come in and out of his life I would be sad too if my friend left.
Deepfake Jeffery.
#canceljeffery
car meet? nooo, meet AND GREET
Madison, good luck on your next chapter of life ✌❤
Damn hire me on ill do anything for jeffree star cosmetics or for you personally big fat pipe dreams but shit it would legit be my life dream to work for you lol im sooooooo low on the list but that doesn't bother me im a no body im cool with it just talking to no one lol
Good luck with your next adventure, Christian ✌❤
It would be great if he thanked his fans too. I mean yes he's worked his butt off to get to where he is. . However his channel or makeup line would be nothing without his fans.
drama dragqueen
I can’t look at this the same since meatcanyon made that vid. It’s too real
sir wants attention-
Good luck! My advice would be try not hire someone from LA so the drama of LA isn't a begining factor esp for a personal assistant. I just kicked my man out and I'm glad I don't have kids to put them through it. We r all looking for our new chapter. I'm hoping mine comes w a change of scenery and better pay whenever my job resumes or I get another job. Again good luck and much love
Get this BS out of my recommended videos....PUKE
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_42FRcEzKVc
Ik it sounds dramatic but he probably doesnt have many friends and not being able to live life normally now is hard as hella for everyone i think its super sweet he made a video dedicated to his friends
Damn i hoped YOU were saying goodbye.
Oh my god this video is such clickbait. Typical
Aight bye
Yup! Thought is was a good bye to You tube,  a lot of heavy breathing, and stroking his hair :(
https://youtu.be/DtIhWwB2S1Q
Waaaay to long and drawn out, sigh sigh, heavy breathing, sigh sigh. Come on! Clickbait
A quick scripture for some of y’all - “Do not be anxious or worried about anything, but in everything [every circumstance and situation] by prayer and petition with thanksgiving, continue to make your [specific] requests known to God.” ‭‭Philippians‬ ‭4:6‬ ‭AMP💕‬‬
Please go
Overly dramatic.. *major eye roll"👀
I need a job please
money cant buy happiness i guess
Unless this is his suicide note, i dont care.
LMAOO TF IS THAT HAIR BRUH
Yall act like he was lying in the title but he is really saying goodbye, as well as all of us. Christian and Maddy lynn are a huge part of this Channel and will be missed so much. Sending them both well wishes, health and happiness
You could have just made a tweet
GONE! Lmao so dramatic.❤️
Jaffar Starfish is trying his best to stay relevant.
Can you give him a call out or referral?? We've supported you AND him. How can we follow him to support his future ventures? Without him, there would have been no you on YouTube. No one exists or succeeds alone.
Shit! I thought he was gonna die... 😔
If only the dogs could talk. 🤔
Good thing the comments can save everyone some time
Lol his cameraman and assistant probably left for a reason. Jeffree should’ve left too💀
Classic Clickbait
It seems like most people that he loves are leaving him for one reason or another.
Jeffree, firstly i wanted to say sorry for your loss, the people who have been with you since the beginning were amazingly talented individuals and i am sorry that they left you for bigger and better things. I think you are just as amazing as the team who have been with you for so long. Your you tube channel has been entertaining ever since i watch you go from the pink house to your new spa house and i have not seen your ranch yet but i am working on it. I love your reviews on the competitions cosmetic line i think you have honesty and integrity, but as a consumer it is also the freedom of choice that my skin may be different than yours. i respect that you know that being in cosmetics and modelling you are super honest and i like that about you. My Daughter has almost all of your pallets. I know you will find replacements or maybe promote one of your younger people to fill those space now left but be kind to them and patient as they have to start from scratch, they are not going to be replacing the ones whom have moved on but they will be almost as good or better if given the right footing to walk on, if you know what i mean, sometimes you can be intimidating the way you can come across sometimes. I think the new people who work for you will put their own twist on things you may like and give you ideas for your next line of Cosmetics or Accessories , a decorating tip or just doing as you ask who knows. In closing i think you are an amazing warm person who enjoys life the way it could be sometimes i wish i was you, but thats a whole other thing. I know you know what having no money feels like but at least you have talent and a flare for things in the cosmetic world and you will continue to scare and entertain us. You are wonderful dont give up Jeffree do some deep breething exercises and some Yoga or Tai Chi, and learn to relax more that way your Anxiety will be more managable. I have a severe Anxiety disorder that comes with my Fibromyalgia amongst other things so i am tired and in pain all the time. again another story for another time. I wish you continued success and i am sure you will find what you are looking for just be patient with the new ones they can be your BFF's too.

I love you, I wish I could be your makeup artist full time, but I live in Argentina. <3 lots of love!!
I love the wittle one, ahhhh nevermind he said Donatella!! Sooo cute. I wish he didn't cut his hair
Is divinci the little baby?
LETS GOOOOO!
This video is just CLICKBAIT
To all the people saving my energy and time and telling me what happens. Thank you   💕🦋 didn’t wanna give them anymore energy then I’ve already given them. Was hoping for the reign of the dramatic youtubers to end though 🙄
we won bois
I love to be part of the Star family
My name is  Alexis Xtina Fierce Collinwood
I would love to try to be your camera girl and your assistance but when your ready girl God bless you Jeffrey Star
People still watch you??? Showed up on my recommended and couldn’t get through even one minute
He is so over dramatic
So they’re not quitting?
its sad and makes me feel bad that I dont hate gay people but Jeffery star makes me hate gay people, im only hear in hope that he was leaving
awww i’m so sorry that u have to hold a camera on ur own this must be so hard for u 🥺🥺
I mean, slide into my DM’s I’ll the camera boy.
Just constructive criticism that you’ve probably already heard. Do the thing before it turned into a huge infomercial.
Gay nigga
God I hoped he's leaving
Wasted 11 mins of my life....
Good, go away!
So your joining bontdf???
New video. I wonder what he’s gonna try and sell you guys next. Your fav never mine 😂
Disgusting 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
Everything about you just oozes fake.
For those who are mocking and being sarcastic about Jeffree talking about his videographer have to understand that Jeffree is addressing this video to his fans, they know who is he talking about. They know him because there were always interactions with Christian in almost every video (voice off camera), if not all his videos.
Bye
dissapointed that he's not actually leaving 🙄
jeffree, wheres the music?
Love you Jeffree 💪🏽
Trying to stay relevant like::::
I have a bottle of champagne saved for the occasion. Thank I waited before to watch the video before opening it.
Shit, I’ll be your assistant! Can’t replace her but I’m pretty good at doing shit
I wish he was leaving YouTube! Did I just say that out loud?
Why act fancy
Are you actually serious going from talking about a global pandemic and death and illness this past year and then proceed to do a saying goodbye video about your videographer and your p.a seriously wise up you need to catch a grip
Sociopath
When this video makes you cringe hella hard, low-key was rally hoping he was done with YouTube.
Good
Setup a interview with me I'll be your assistant and we would work wonders together guaranteed
I hope you are not leaving forever 😢💔
I never watched to begin with, how dare you be in my reccomended.
Ugh!!! You scared me Jeffrey!!😂
I was about to say god bless, but nvm 😑 leave it to Jeffree to hype up bs like this
saying goodbye to your channel.... never seen a bigger clickbait
When you cant even pay people to be around you. How sad. 💅
Your a man pretending to be a girl get over yourself
Okay it seems that every YouTuber in this platform leaves after getting money
You really had my thinking you were leaving YouTube
Another full grown man acting like a adolescent girl.  Hasn’t anyone ever read “The Emperors New Clothes”?  Jesus dude...
I thought he was leaving 😾
aw... I was excited, thought you had finally left... bummer...
It’s been alot
Omg...I want Donatella so baaaaad <3
me when reading the title: FINALLY, 🎵when jesus says yes nobody can say no🎵. me after reading the comments: SERIOUSLY 😒
can i have some money?
Seems like everyone is leaving you. You better pay them more money, don't be cheap.
❤❤❤❤❤❤
Jefree I hope ur charger breaks
i thought for the first time since lockdown there would be finally some good news nevermind
725 it starts
Sis needs help like calm down gurlll
Waisted time! Ewww
I love how he put himself in the group with the folks that work to the bone to get by while his ass was out buying a new home and 2 more dogs while the rest of us are dead broke and dead tired but hey its ok he still pretty and loaded so it is what it is lol his ass couldn’t do half the work we are all doing tf out of here
Discusting freak of nature.
Dangit I thought you were quitting but you didn’t :( now I’m sad
Am I the only ones who does'nt give af?
oh hoped you were leaving!
Good riddance.
Thanks for those who posted what the video was about!
Why is this crap in my recommendations.  Wtf YouTube!
Disgusting.
Omg he gay 🤮🤮🤮
If the titanic was a person...
Stopping by the comments before watching cause you know it's gonna be clickbait lol
Can I apply to be your new assistant? I have no problem uprooting my life. I’ll drop everything to service you king!!!
Oh great bye!
Joooooee bidennnn
This is stupid
Don't blame your cameraman for leaving.
Him saying “I’ve never done this before” I was like casting couch? 😳
Lol just watched the hunger games and he legit looks like the people from the capital.. and that's not a compliment!
K
Got my hopes up
Took him 11 minutes and 24 seconds just to say “my camera man left”
We did it boys! He is gone 😎
His followers are the dumbest in the whole internet!
I don’t mind watching James Charles crying and saying goodbye!
Wasn’t this sugerfoot canceled
Я зависим от онанизма, моя жизнь катится ко дну. Незнаю как выбраться из этого состояния. Живу с этим мнигие годы. Эта блудная страсть мешает мне жить
I wasted 11 minutes of my life watching Jebediah complain about his cameraman leaving😖😑
I love this break-down of his processing.   Excited to see where 2021 and 2022 takes you with your new expectations and shifts! We love seeing you, always, and we only wish the best for you. You’ve always been one of my favorites since the og days and you will continue to be. Thank you for your realness, despite all the drag-downs from media and all that. You’re a raaad boss ass bissh always. 😛💖
Jeffrey reminds me of BoJack like his personality In this vid
This is so dramatic for absolutely no reason
Stop no one cares
The only reason I finished watching the video cause I like watching his dogs
The day he leaves will be the day youtube becomes a nicer, more wholesome, and humble platform for all
Clipbait af, the camera man is just leaving.
Wow. Thinking we care about you in the operating room kinda over the top ....anyone???? Or,I'm actually feeling high listening to Jeffrey speak maybe all that hot air that went in his weirdo curlers! LA VILLA STRANGEIEOTO " style weirdo  drug inspired (??) wtf Pray for him? Like become a Satanist.
k bye
He’s not even leaving... dislike.
Looking fabulous!!!
Best of luck ! You got this ! Stay strong! 😍
baii we wont miss u
❤
You Made me though that you were going to stop doing YouTube forever. You scared me 😱😰
I’ll Love you forever Jeffree ⭐️ 💕 Let all the snowflake haters ❄️ melt. You are a Queen 👑 🌟
Bitch where is that mascara! Haha   You are gonna pull through! You got this.
Thanks Jefree that u don’t allow any advertising in your  videos
I’ve loved you since the MySpace days and I’ll continue to love you to the end of days 💕
clickbait
Eihryd
Nooooo 😂😂😂 you need ATTENTION! The deflection is REAL 😬😬
I was paying more attention to the dogs more than him
Well now, after that over-dramatic act, I wonder if he/she would flay about on the floor screaming "Why, why, why?" should an employee break a finger or something.  What a freak show.
Nobody does product reviews like you, never stop doing them!!
brokest personality
Click bait.
Who gives a shit
Only if he would take accountability just for being a heartless drama queen and the people he has hurt,,if anyone should be really canceled it should JS,, yes his make up is top notch,  but he is not,,,I'm over his cover-ups lies and he is a sinful devil,,,
Hello just doing my job 👨‍🏭
You go girl 🤘❤️
I THINK YOUR FACE IS BETTER. 😁 (FROM BULLIES thoughts to MESS IT up!) GO VEGAN. ALL THE WAY. TRUST ME. WE ARE UNDER MIND CONTROL TO NOT BE OURSELVES.  EVEN SKIN SATURATION CONTROLLED BY BULLIES. SAD!
Freak
Gross AF.
🐽
Hey if you don't want to watch the video it's simple: Just don't watch it. I know that Jeffree's problems may sound superficial for you, but it's his life and he's been sharing it since 2015 in Youtube, so... yeah, don't be mean.
Nice try.
Bruh no one cares sweaty
He did this for views
Literally wow! Gurl!!! 😂
To save everyone alot of time. It's classic clickbait to make Jeff millions from us watching this. He sighs, moans, complains and in the end it a.k.a. (Jeff) needs to hire a new camera man. Your Welcome.
Good riddance! Good bye!
leave yt next time please i got so excited for nothing
I SWEAR IF HE DID LEAVE YOUTUBE ID CRY I KNOW HE IS NOT THE BEST PERSON BUT I LOVE HIS CHANNEL ALSO hi how are ya
"hes not leaving youtube his camera man and assistant left, youre welcome" only if id read the comments before watching a vid
Im sorry but when he says i cant wait to travel.....bitch......you been traveling
This is crazy, everyone acting so silly because his goodbye is to his camera man, christian was with him for almost 6 years! There was alot of trust and a huge friendship between them, he was like family! I can totally understand why he made this video and its very bittersweet. What I can't understand is all the neg comments and hate like just stop it,  we are all quick to make someone accountable for spreading hate while at the same time doing it ourselves. Good luck jeffree lynn, I wish you the best on the journey to finding someone you can trust and form a bond with to film, and I wish christian the best in his new endeavors!  And same to Maddie!
Bruh who cares if ur camera man is quitting stop acting depressed and go hang out in ur personal nail salon
Ew-
RIP
The fact that he could have cut that first part out but wanted the drama/theatrics. When will he stopppppp
If y’all are clever enough to insult him only using words with a positive connotation you’re comment won’t be deleted
He puts the drama in queen!
My dream is to find a good husband and live on our own ranch ahhhh a girl can dream!!
This is a man 😶
You should quit too.
Please just make makeup review videos. I was your biggest biggest fan. I am about to unsubscribe if the next video is again something like this 🤨
God fucking dammit I was really hoping it was just him leaving. This platform would do better without him tbh. Give youtubers a better reputation.
you scare me bro
When a meeting could have been an email
ayo this nigga seem gay af
😂
In a few years we need an update on their lives
You are so out of it. You need to re evaluate.
this feels like one of the most honest YouTube videos I’ve seen in a long time, it’s refreshing
Bye
No stress, no drama… OK this is Jeffrey Starr here there is always drama it will come out eventually! He probably had enough of the bullshit. LA Is literally the devils spawn! Anyone who lives in LA knows the evil that surrounds it! So get out while you can.
Didn’t hear a word he said because I was completely wrapped up by those damn dogs.  Omg the puppy.
Is this that IT clown that eats children??
I thought Jeffery was about to quit on us like man i started wrong a long message
I am Stopping by to say Hello
Me:  _yeah yeah, get to the point_
What is up with that thumb nail?!
I like the realness
I feel like I’m on twitter reading this comment section 😭😭🤣
Thank god!! Girl bye
the lack of tea in this video is insane.
Where’s the vogue thumbnail this time
HAHAH BYE
Goodbye and stay away
😭😭😭 we all love you so much 💖💖💖 pls always stay safe and stay strong 🍓💓
lol get reckted nerd
I’ll be your assistant
So what. Don't care. Boring
Saying “goodbye” to get views but not really saying goodbye
can you please just.....stop
Ankle bracelet probably ?
You are NOT getting the vaccine 😂😂😂😂 you are part of the agenda the more I look into your life.
Then why did you unfollow maddie on Instagram?
we love Jeffree spelling everyone wrong and just ignoring being cancelled...
I Farted
Im sorry Jeffree, but the dogs stole the show. They looked so cute playing.
Jeffree: "there's no tea, there's no drama" The title: "Saying Goodbye..."
He's making me out of breath by all the heavy breathing 😂😂
lol where can I submit my application to be your assistant?
He is always ready with new drama. Over it
This is the realest video you’ve made in a long time ! Always happy to see the growth Jeffrey ❤️ .you got this!!
Damn so you aren’t leaving.
It's the over the top "sighing" for me
This is the most genuine he's been in a while though.
I love the tiny spotted pup. Reminds me of mini Australian Shepard.
Why not bother putting Chris in front of the camera & doing a proper farewell? That would have been worth it.
'Like Rats Fleeing a Sinking Ship... '
so you don't waste ur time - its just his camera dude leaving
And the world rejoiced.
Bruh please, he's doing too much 😭 like yeah, someone who works for you is leaving, it's kind of sad but at the same time like just wish them well and Jesus Christ do something normal like maybe sent them a gift basket and give them a hug or no not hug, a fist pump and that's it like bro- you literally didn't have to make this whole ass video??? He obviously just did all this for himself, where the cameraman at if it's for him to say goodbye?? 🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️
Oh, thank you. Have been waiting for this.
You’re trash jeffrey boy
Drama Queen.  🤡
Someone who makes six figures with YouTube ad revenue and millions from his makeup or whatever else he sells is not quitting.. I paused the video and read the comments lol
All YouTube and Google employees deserve cancer, for recommending these kinds of stupid videos to me.  Here's another thumbs-down, and I'm deleting this from my watch history, too.
wow, what a dramatic fool. I hope cancel culture rips this dude a new one.
Hola
Damn... thought he was going to do the right thing for once.... should’ve known 🤡🤡🤡
The puppies make it perfect
Oh my god when i saw the title i was like bitch where you going 🤦‍♀️❤
the click bait is real next week we’re gonna get an apology video saying “I wanna be transparent with you guys 🥺”
What is on her  head ?
Are you going off utube? GOOD,, seeya....never liked you.
We wish this wasn't click bait.  - everyone
I would do it Jeffery.i have all the time in the world.With nothing too do.Im a dedicated person. And would be great.Email me if interested.
Funny how he can be dramtic over his camera man leaving but not over his apologies
Am I the only one seeing all the dogs killing each other and getting tangled in the blankets in the back ground?? 🤣🤣
Clickbait
The buildup before this video made it seem like there was a lot more to be announced than what it actually ended up being . I mean ok his videographer is leaving, did that really need a video ? Make a post say you will miss him and that’s it! Another stunt to get people talking and wondering what he was announcing and then ... “no tea no drama” 😑😑😑
“Saying goodbye”   Okay bye ✌🏻😂  #notbothered
Oh she passed away? Aww... mmm... alright 🤷‍♂️
It's okay guys, *the cameraman was the one quitting* . What a disappointment
Aww that is a bittersweet thing Jeffree !! I'll work for you a full year or 2  lol
ugh i thought he was leaving finally 🙄 he got me so excited !!!
Yay
blaaahblaahaaah
I thought this was real. Gutted
If only you’d leave for good
bye🙆🙋
I was about say that, im back just to check if he uploaded any videos after this "good bye" video but guess what, i was scrolling down the comments and i found out that he was just dramatic like always, he's cameraman cheated on him (Its a joke)                                 *It was expected*
i wish you were saying you would quit youtube :( someone as mean as you does not deserve a platform. there is a major difference between feeling confident and acting entitled, being arrogant and selfish. i don't know how you still have fans supporting you because honestly most people don't like you anymore.
I think I heard you say you are getting your Vaccine Jeffree.....I'm glad to hear that...I am getting my vaccine too  !!!
Byeeeeeeeeeeeeee
Really, does it have to be a FUCKING long video to say goodbye...I don't want to hear excuses or any reasons...cause nobody needs to know a FUCKING thing... it's easy and short... just say " GOODBYE BITCHES!"
😭😭😭
Miss you!
I feel ur heart it hurts ):
Please leave for real
Pathetic.
bye sister
What the f is this
Aw man Jeffree don’t get our hopes up we thought you were leaving
Love that you call your poms  bears!  I tell everyone that my Pomeranians mother was a Honeybear and his father was a Sugarbear😁🐻💖.   I’ll keep you in my prayers✨🙏✨
wish he quitted
Chile... anyways.... so.  Why the ice cream truck parked outside with that music? 🙄
He is closing his camera?
I thought he was quitting YouTube when I read this
No one cares
Bye were gonna miss you (LIE)
Yes 💕😂
So freaking dramático....too tired   bye Felicia¡
You are  boy or  girl
ن٩٨٩حجضضضضضضضضضضض1صجج$س$$$$جسج$مجقف
Wtf
girl.... nobody died, you got that right??? so relax.... jeez...
Wish he was leaving YouTube. I have such a profound sense of disappointment now.
Do I house and dog update
I would be so awesome as your assistant! I too have 2 adorable Poms. Holly Jean & Hadley Thomas. My world! And I would love your doggies unconditionally! Love you ❤️
This guy scares me
i came here just to dislike it 😚
Wear a mask your putting lives at risk all beacause your to selfish to wear a mask I hope you get the virus these influencers are so stupid
Leave plsss we don't want you we're !
Epic troll lol
People being too mad about the title... It is called "clickbait", look it up
If only it was goodbye for you
Me over here scared Chris passed from Corona. So glad he's moving onto good things!!
*dramatic title* ‘I’ve never done this before’ never seen anything like this before...
Wish you woulda left yt for good 🥺
yall get twisted if he breathes the wrong way
In all honesty you are getting exactly what you deserve. You are selfish, self centered and egotistical. You only give a damn about people if they have something to offer you or you have something to gain by them. I checked your company against the BBB and you have had 750 complaints in the last three years and only 84 resolved in the last 12 months. By my calculations that comes to 7 complaints a month. SEVEN!!!!!  In a 30 day period. You shouldn’t even have that many complaints at all. I know I am one person who has never had a response from your company that resolved my issue AT ALL. Probably because I’m not in the LGBTQ community (whom I support 💯 % I might add). The only difference is I try to treat EVERYONE EQUALLY!!!!!  I don’t pick and choose. Sickening!!!!
Jeffree I would gladly be your personal assistant 🥺
lowkey was hoping he was leaving youtube....
The fake authenticity <<<<<
2021 and I still love you jeffree💕
Omg your new puppy is so cute and funny that I can't focus on you😂
Click bait
I don't see any difference with video you are same Jeffree all good don't worry 👍💪☕
Honey, Please shane and Ryland to help you they are good friends of yours hope you can trust them
Go get Shane Dawson's guy he ain't using him.
Jeffree lynn omg I’m so happy for them but I’m sorry for your loss I know they were family to you and now you won’t get to see them everyday but I’m excited to see what you bring to the rest of 2021 so thankful that things are finally getting back to normal in this world🤞💯
He titled it this becos he knew hed get more ratings more rating more views more money
We all wish you'd leave every platform. I used to support you, and than realizing your the conniving, insecure, nasty, human you've always been. It's not surprise everyone around you migrates elsewhere for "better future." Cause nobody can have a better future with you involved.  His words "whoever gets her next" (maddie) literally, she's not property! What the fuck 😂 this is how he views people who work for him.
seriously 😒😒😒😂💀
Leave
Aww man I thought he was going to quit. sad
Welp disappointed
JS would disintegrate like the Wicked Witch in water if he left social media. Clickybaity.
now that I’ve read the comments I’m not watching this🤣
Clickbait!
clickbait for having views on a boring 11 minute long video. He could have just said all important stuff in a 1 minute long vid.
I WAS Baited- 🧍‍♂️
You are such a fucking boss bitch! I amire you and think you are so amazing! I wish you the best!
I didn't watch this yesterday when it came out and i was like..... huh?? lol didn't actually need to watch this but its cool....😂
This chick has hella dogs
I fucking LOVE JEFFREY STAR like he is just a beautiful human being and his personality is everything 😘 you keep up the good work sweetie❤️.
I almost got exited
Is it just me or am i just watchibg the dogs not jeffery
a lot of people have died due to covid 19... anyway my cameraman is leaving.
I thought I was bizarre, but I can't compete with this guy.......Ooooooooooooooooooh Yeeeeeeeeaaaaahh!
Hold my hair back I'm gonna puke!  What a waste of space
The little pup digging at the blankets is so cute 🥰
Jim Jones Laps Around The Sun Challenge
click bait dislike
Wish it was your ass leaving
Bye lol
Who watches this rubbish
I can't stop watching the dogs...they're so cuuute!!
Be fake for that camera booboo 😂🤣
He is not dramatic! Just imagine having a companion in life and career for a decade and then having to see them go and move on without you. It's so dumb to think that he is the one being dramatic, maybe it's just you being overly judgmental.
Please go away
Damnit i thought HE WAS LEAVING. Now more of THIS pink hair weirdo. 🤦🏿
Oh shit
Why hasn’t he been canceled yet
One word from me: *"MeatCanyon"*
Thank goodness
After all the bs he dumped on james alot of people hate him
I really wish you, you find somebody who can really trust and takes good care of you and the babies 😍
Hopefully u will never come back
Chris didn’t move on he quit
Bye, have a nice day 😘😘😘
Anyone else waiting for D’Angelo Wallace to cover this?
Shocking that a click bait video has that many likes ( in comparison to dislikes)
It puts the lotion in the basket!
Oh.. Jeffree really is cancelled. I don’t know fully understand why because I’m out of the loop. But I feel sorry for him for some reason. But correct me if I’m out of line. But shit, just a human being a human! Unless he did some shifty things?
You people in the comments are so disrespectful! He's saying goodbye to two of the most important people in his life, this would be super hard for anyone! Jeffree I respect and love you so much, I wish you all the best for your future 🥰
I with HE left youtube and not his "Assistants"  smh😒
Still hasn't gotten Nails done✅ Chris the Camera man left ✅ Personal assistant left ✅ JStar Mascara is Coming ✅ Been through alot, People, Places and Things- Come and Go, that is Life 💕
Why hasn’t he left yet
Oh no! You have to do things for yourself now! What ever will you do
jfc i mean
SKELETOR!!!!! THIS IS YOUR LAST CALLING TO LEAVE YOUTUBE!!!! WE DON'T WANT YOU THERE!!!!!
Wait, so you're not leaving? :/
So dramatic 💀🤌🏽
What a desperate for views loser.
The test: Explain your answer in more than 5 sentences. My answer:
I’d love to be the personal assistant ❤️
Repent now because the Kingdom Of God is near!
Jesus sub to me this is creepy life
Interesting Wyoming He say hmmmm isn't that also were Kanye's ranch is also. Just wondering
"im getting the vaccine thank god i cant wait to travel again" that should not be the first thing you are doing when you get the vaccine...
I'm disappointed i though you were doing us a favor 😪
I thought for a second that in the thumbnail that was lele pons
The ugly ass acting at the beginning 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Andrue?? Frim Shane?? Pick him :D
Jeffree: 2020 was so crazy Me: SOOO TRUUUUUUE!!!!!
I know what happened the tea had spilled fast 😌
Dang I thought he was going away for real
ok?
Why is this in my recommend I don’t watch any of this shit
Oh my ga— “Hi guys- wait.... Okay, hi guys—I’m gonna set this down... Okay, hi guys— hi bears!... Okay, hi guys— oww, my knee.... Okay, hi guys— *deep inhale*.... Okay, hi gu–“  MAKE A GODDAMN SCRIPT!!
Why is this even trending?
I m so dissapointed i hoped you say you leave forever..m
Who is this chick and why is she in my recommended?
Goddammit, it’s just his cameramen
All y’all are mad what he had to say wasn’t dramatic enough. What do you guys just watch for someone’s downfall? Like be human beings seriously
I’d happily be your assistant, hit me up.
the amount of jeffree being dramatic in this video pls-
I was really hoping this piss stain was leaving Youtube, but I guess not. Ugh.
Omg🙄🤮
Why he wanted to steal cardi b’s look???
Clickbait af
When are u leaving YouTube? Can it be this year?
False Promises Palette - Coming Soon
Was going to say so long and good riddance
To whoever is reading this:  I know it's not always easy, but you will feel better You are not alone. You are important, no matter whether you see it or not. You matter, I promise Don't give up, think positively and believe in yourself ( ◜‿◝ )♡  Have a good day/night 🖤🖤🖤
I typed in 'Alien Grey' and I get brought here!!🤔
I was hoping goodbye meant he was being launched out of our atmosphere into the sun.
No one cares
When you work with people as long as he has your employees turn in to friends, from close friends, to family ❤️💙💜💗😊 so if you have a problem with emotions maybe you should watch more of his videos 😉
God has shown me a message for you!! God will bring great famine, dreadful judgements, wild beasts and plagues! Have you accepted Christ yet?! The time is coming and none can stop it!
I would thank all people who commented that ,this is about his cameraman. So yeah, Thank u for saving my 11 minutes ❤
JUST LEAVE
ew i thought he was finally quitting
Wow I do not see any emotion poor Jefree
Omg the cringe thumbnail hahahaha you look hilariously ugly hahahaha
America, you're going crazy!
I bet he did this before when he was in myspace too many times!!!!...Another lie added to his list🙄🙄🙄
Well well well this speaks volumes, people keep leaving him and I wonder wby!!!...Or maybe I should say I know why bye Jefree Star you were my idol now you are just so ridiculous and enjoy all your wealth because material shit does not last forever honey.
Dang I was so excited until I found out he’s not actually leaving☹️☹️☹️
About time
I wouldn’t blame the camera man tho lmao
Aweee J... love you! Hang in there... when a door closes it just means another one will open elsewhere !!  Xxoo 🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍
That's just gross
Damn they want to leave you cuz they don't like you. And this video is a waste of time
https://youtu.be/-RAglyw6ySk
Holly hell you are dramatic and pathetic
Lotsa disappointed people on the comments lol hope the person leaving appreciates this effort, that’s all that matters
Trash
No one cares about you ,such a narcissic
Who are you are you girl or boy
He was very dramatic in this one!!!
Gose to show he really cares about his team! Respect! I've had 2 employers that have treated me right and respected me and my work ethics instead of taking advantage!   My previous employer said if I needed to have another surgery she would fund a way to fire me! Taking into mind It had been 4 weeks after my major surgery (20th surgery in last 12 years) if I hadn't have this surgery I would've ended up in hospital with with infection on my brain!  So no! I don't think he's being "drastically dramatic". Good CEO care about their team! Bad CEO treat their team like robots or that piece of dog sh*t you walk pass in the park!
do you just breathe or can you talk as well
Jeffree Star: Category issss: CLICK-BAIT!
Lmao desperate much jeffreee
Your A Wierdo. Goodbye !!!
Girl, you look georgous in this video. I hope you vould move on with new employees  and not feeling lonely in that big house. Stay healthy and excellent as always 💕
lol the ridiculous amount of negative conments is hilarious.
Dont come back.
Someone just put him to sleep permanently ⚰️
I was expecting him to say goodbye to social media 💀
Ok but the hair is lowkey cute af
I don't believe a word that comes out of this toxic racists mouth.
This is what a hot mess looks like. Sadly It’s not leaving.
Click bait
I wish he was leaving youtube
Dude, you need therapy
its nothing, his camera man just left after 5 years of working with him why 11 minutes tho?
Okay but this is so respectful
If the IT clown and Arnold Schwarzenegger had a baby ....
Hang on there Jeffrey 🖤
Please fire the hair guy! He needs to go!✅
This feels like a NikocadoAvocado video....
Alot of DRAMA as usual. With everything going on in this world, WHO CARES! Move on Miss Jeffree
Literally NO ONE cares. Fakest, pathetic person.
I love this Jeffree!! 😘😘😘
So disgusting LOL
My first thought was he got caught by Kim
Pfff who gives a shit! Every video feels so fake! Saying I'm soo emotional as many times as you can doesn't make you more emotional haha! Can't believe the people that have such a platform these days! Boring AF
He looked cute in the thumbnail
🤣🤣 filming is hella hard! I would freak too if my cameraman left, but I never had one
who cares
when will he leave?!
🐂🔪🔪🔪🔪
You know the fame is passing if he’s clickbaiting
while youre at it why dont u just quit youtube too :(
his dogs are literally doing the dirty in the background-
Top 10 apologies video part 2
don't let this distract you to what he's done to james... monster
... I love how Jefferee releases a super genuine, and emotional video about friendships he is losing daily contact with, and because it isn't a bunch of "tea" and drama its a "waste of time" and "garbage content."  Y'all are the problem, not Jefferee, James, Shane, Tati, or any of the others. Its YOU. You want people to hate and bash on so you can feel a sense of moral superiority. Guess what, by doing that you are already the lowest of the low so congratulations! And be thankful that the internet is anonymous because I guarantee most of y'all wouldn't be showing your ass like this if it wasn't.
y'all he's saying goodbye to his friend it's not just a camera man damn
I thought he was quitting YouTube thank god he isn’t
I wish I could make it on my own too. There is a shift in my life and it calls me to pull away from relatives.
ive never watched a single one of your videos and im glad to see you go.
make sure you wear a mask in public
Finally
I cannot take that face seriously
I hope his dogs abandon him next.
as dramatic as he is, he’s clearly going through things as he said and this a friend that he’s saying goodbye to. you never know how tough things can be behind the scenes, just please stop with the negative comments :(
My god, nice click bait. No one actually cared that your camera man left.
Thanks for al the comments guys! Im glad i didn't have to watch this BS
I am praying for you but I know you will survive!!!!
I was so happy I thought he quit YouTube
I was hoping he would quit youtube, but no. Lord Orochimaru continues to live
But not to YouTube ..
🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨
Whatttttttttttttttttt
Jesus christ he's devil wearing human skin
00:52 I hear the man inside lol
God damn it I thought he was quitting, sad days
Why the fuck are most of the videos on trending either garbage clickbait videos, horrible music vevos, or stupid Fortnite gameplays? Heck I'd rather watch Dreams manhunts over and over again than most of the trash in trending.
okay I’m listening to him but I’m also just staring at the dogs lmao
Bruh everyone hating on him for no reason is funny to me. Do you guys really think he cares? Like damn 🤡
I hope this is the fall of Jeffree.
Bestie calm down....
XRP
Can he stop acting so hurt it's so visible that it's fake. Idk how some people don't catch on to it. The title is clickbait. GIVING IT A THUMBS DOWN!
Why did he leave??
How did I end up here.
damn he aint quitting got my hopes up
Wow imagine being his former cameraman or assistant and he just made money off of you quitting your job 🙄

What’s with the fake laugh 24/7. Even when he tries to be serious he does it. I don’t get it.🤔🤭

https://youtu.be/tJx13W3YZnc
You should of let Chris personally find his successor.
I love that you can put on a show in one breath and be real sauce the next. Make the world beautiful, stoned, with plenty of red bull for all!
You mean the Freakshow is going away oh no what will I do
How unfortunate you're not fucking off
Dramatic 🎭 tha house, girl.
Once again your clickbait manages to get alot of views it's so fkn annoying at this point you "influencers" get paid a shit ton to be a shitty person... I feel like everything has gone backwards idk.....
Far King Go already
Damn i really gave Jim Crow a view thinking he was quitting just to find out its about his fkin cameraman. Calculated clickbait, no surprise coming from him.
Ugh i thought he was leaving
Jeffrey star... haha
Leave, take your millions, don't come back.
Clickbait
Why do people watch these self loathing fake creators
This FOOL is HIGH AF LOL
all ya'll are so dumb hating soo much yet you're giving him views and money good job your dumb.
Good Vibes Jeffree ❤️❤️❤️✨
Disgusting 🤮 i feel nauseated  🤢 even looking at this man. How do people even watch him and actually listen to him?
Jesus is the way the truth and the light. He said to repent from your sins and follow him so that you may receive the gift of heaven!❤️
Te Apollo eres genial
Aw i hoped to stop seeing him on trending. Guess not
He certainly knows how to get our attention 🙄
Damn I was rly hoping he was just gonna quit youtube but ig not
i ran over expecting him to quit but got disappointed.
Jeffrey Star is hiring friends.
Bye bye see ya
GOOD FUCKA BYE 👋🏼
stupid clickbait title! why is this trending!!
Wtf...
I wish this really was bye. But this reptile is way too fucking narcissistic to leave.
Love you❤
It's going to be okay Jeffrey. Just do the best you can. You got this😘
When AREN'T you youtubers saying goodbye
I started the trouble I'm crying please help me
aww hes not quitting
No one cares anymoree jeff
hi I say can please help me give me money it turned out I have a problem no money and also no food and the old house can give me money $60,000 please please what am I asking for help
When jeffree realizes that he isn’t it. It’s us. You wouldn’t be a brand or a figure if it were for US. Get. It. All. The. Way. Together. It ain’t you. It’s us that made you! Of course he’d never leave this platform. That’s bad marketing
I really want to see Jefree release a new music album. His previous ones were uniquely good.
What a fucking tool!
Bro I was worried he was shutting down his channel or JSC 🥵
I would like to throw my name into the hat, my qualifications are: 1. I have no life so I can travel whenever, wherever (like Shakira!) 2. I will throw hands in your defense 3. I am ugly (no competition) 4. I can eat an entire package of Oreos in less than 2 minutes (1.54 is my best) 5. I will test your food for poisoning before you eat it (I am selfless) 6. I know what makeup is Thank you for your consideration.

Leave YouTube
Dont act like u give a fu** abt people who actually suffered during covid.   While u live in ur fancy a$@ house not worry abt money while most still struggle.
Wtf even are you
bye!  🎊 about time
Why is this so much more authentic and genuine than his apology?  but I understand why it’s a big deal bc he’s had this camera guy/ friend and personal assistant for years
Hang in the J, we love you ❤️
h
Ew he's so gross!!
I wish you the best I wish you wouldn’t quit but enjoy your life Jeffrey ! Been 5years and still a fan
can u just leave youtube PLEASEEE ur getting my hopes up
Aw he's not actually quitting YouTube, what a shame...
Just want you to know if you ever need a friend, I don’t expect a single thing from you. I feel like we are the same in many ways. Sending you good energy!

Why do people think it is attractive to tattoo themselves to the extreme. It isn't. It looks awful.
Just stopping by to dislike and clear my history
🐬Darknees🐬
Only one thing to say...... 'goodbye'
Are you boy or girl?
why are all of you so rude? you guys don't have anything better to do with your lives so you just spread hate, didn't your families teach you if you have nothing nice to say then don't say it at all, it's really that simple. it's not hard to be positive, so maybe all of you should try it.
I was hoping this was the end. Of it all, it's just eww.
HAHA POO HEAD

He looks tired 😢
This man is so disorganized with life!
3:13 “i’ve come such a long way” babe... your channel is dying and you’ve lost so many of your followers tf 😭😭
Definitely want to see more of the dogs 💕💕💕 Poms are so sweet, we have a little girl named Coconut and I love seeing more poms as they aren’t very popular where I live
Damn it i was hoping he was leaving YouTube 😪
Clickbait
Who else thinks Andrew would be a good fit for a little while?
Love Ya Jeffrey
Call me. I can help you out. 🍄🐛🦋🌈
Here's a flashlight for that darkness 🔦
Wish he was actually leaving. F
*I am Stopping by to say Hello*
this dude is crazy and disgusting bro how does he have almost 17 mil
He’s still here?
💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗
wtf
Its the PS4 sound in the background for me 😆
LETS GOOOOOOOOO  edit: man it turns out he's not quitting YouTube
The clickbait for views... I fell into the trap 😔
Jeffrey star is like a marlin manson version
Bye
This may be a dumb question but why can't he just film some of his own videos?? Smaller you tubers do this
Really ? “ GIRL “ * Clickbait the house 🏠... Damm I thought you were leaving lol 😆’ maybe you can hire #Shane you both seem to be good for each other both  evil 🦹‍♂️ , and mean 😪 it would work out great 👍.
Why is this dude still putting makeup on ? And it stays on trending. It looks Jewish 😂
creature of the night
Who actually pays attention to crap like this. People literally worship celebs🤡
Wow I can't believe Belle Delphine is saying goodbye to her camera man and assistant :( so sad
Sadly there is no tea, no drama   Drama 🐶: Oh believe me honey there’s dramaaaaaa 💖
Byeee
I was really hoping this was an actual goodbye
We’ve been click baited 😂
Damn it I thought “it” was going
Eww wtf
This dude looks so funny 😂
What a trainwreck.
don't come back.
I swear his couch is more than my net worth
Man had us excited that he was leaving youtube. Nope. Just his camera man.
Holy shit i hate this guy
Go and shut yourself
Get PC’d (Piece Controled) I don’t even care I just click on a random video to piecerolled
Really your not leaving youtube 😭😭😭 The only good thing about this is the camera man escaped alive.... Honestly just joking just wanted to o troll 😂🤣😂
Just fucking quit. Do it. Please
Both Maddie AND Christian?!?!?
Quick question are you hiring 😂
Love you jeffree you'll get threw this
So your looking for a videographer? It would be an honor 🙏🏾
Wish you would bro
Ew
why does him trying to be "raw and real" feel even more fake than when he's putting on a face and posing for apology video thumbnails? That whole beginning clip setting up the camera and trying to act like a real person was almost unwatchable.
😍😍🥰😘 YAAAAAAASSSSS you're still the boss bitch Jeffree!!
Who cares he left you and he wasn't yo friend wasn't he like your boyfriend

How many deep pfffffffs did we get before he even started talking. No, no more deep breaths!
I love you so much
jesus...
I really hate when people write some video titles like that just to get trending or to get views, that’s annoying.
Omg i don't care what no body says,  I love YOU ❤ ❤
He clickbaited so he can final be trending again
Ok bye
It's his chanel he can post whatever he wants + if you don't like him don't watch him 😁✌
Thought he died
BET also GET OUT OF MY RECOMMENDATION
I don't have much of a life lmao, can move to California to shoot your videos lmao
Damn r.i.p to hes channel
wierd world we live in!!!!!!...not about covid...right?
I wish it was him lmao, too bad the comments say that his camera man is leaving :(
Adjusts camera* "Hi, ive never done this before" Has dogs out* Just got back from something hense messy attire* Excessive sorry's and heavy breathing*   Me HOLY SHIT BINGO I ACTUALLY GOT ONE
Ok but that hairstyle is really cute i'm sorry i couldn't resist.
Yep, im pretty sure this world is nearing the end after seeing this dude and the amount of subscribers he has
Dafaq is up with that thumbnail
Damn I thought he was leaving :( I wish he was he's so ugly bro.
11 minutes of clickbait hope you got all the money you want for this video! Good day miss gurl
I was hoping he’d leave youtube. He’s toxic as fuck. Physical representation of  T O X I C
Damn dramatic I think we all know this but damn Jeffery is as clickbaity as those 5 minute crafts
damn I was actually excited for him to quit 😭
Aight bye
WHO CARES
Sad to see how hypocritical your hates are. Talk about toxicity!! Jeffree, hope you find a new and just as good assistant and cameraman. Saying goodbye to people who’ve been in your life for so long is tough, but glad y’all are on good terms❤️
And my bf can be your camera man ok bye we love u
I can be your new assistant ok bye ily
Somebody kill it before it lays eggs.
Good thing  the comments saved my  time! Thank you!
All of you should quit. Bye
CLICK BAIT WE ALL JUST GAVE THIS F MORE REVENUE !
🤸‍♀️🙃
is this what 20/20 vision is like?? wow
You seem sad and lonely right now I wanna be your friend ❤
I'm disappointed that he isn't leaving YouTube.
Why is Nichole Tv not trending over him?
How come YouTube doesn’t find this content offensive. It’s gut wrenching.
❤️🙏🏻❤️
was hoping for him to leave social media... the people in the comments are real ones for doing a ‘long story short’😭
Wow I’m so glad I went straight to the comments that would’ve been 11 minutes of my life down the drain he’s so dramatic like dude your literally rich just hire a new camera man and get over it sheesh
Dam :(
Me remembering that time Ricky Dillon was in that random Jeffree video
CLICKBAIT.. Thats all you have left Grandpa 🤡
this is so dramatic for what?
More racketeering
I feel violated and disgusted that I clicked on HIS video, being happy that he was leaving youtube and for once something good is happening to and on the youtube beauty community...
I really don't care
Sis I was ready to say goodbye why haven’t u left yet🤨🤨
hair color is on fleek
bye idc
Bye Felicia 🙂🔌
Why tf did youtube choose to put this clickbait video on *•Trending•* ? Ridiculous 😑
When you brought up Chris I 100% thought you were gonna say he died
Let us know where to apply :)
STOP RECOMMENDING ME CROSS DRESSING GUYS WEARING MAKEUP!
again? lol
Jesus is coming soon. Get right with God.
Jeffree, change is always difficult to manage when you have as many moving parts as you do.  Don't trust the universe TOO much to bring you someone, you've got to do the work as well.  I have the perfect person for your audio/video needs.  He's educated in London (willing to move) and has a BS in Studio Engineering.  I know you're not looking for anyone here, but I'm really serious about this.  It isn't me, it is a dear friend of mine who I would trust with my life.  Let me know if you're interested.
Me: *pooping* Jeffree “Let’s take some deep breaths.” Me: I don’t think you wanna do that
Bye
Girl..this could have been handled with a simple tweet. You kinda make things bigger than they need to be
You are an inspiration to me Jeffree , thanks for everything, you will be stronger than ever  ! Thanks for sharing ,  I wish you the best always
I WANT TO BE YOUR CAMERA MAN!!!!!!!!!!!!! HMU!
I'll do it!
i got excited at first, i thought he finally quit 😔
The dogs wanted to be the stars of this video lol
Go away
God I wish you we’re leaving, big disappointment
I don't really like you but good luck.
aww man, i was so excited to see you leave :(
This video is so tone deaf lol

Goodbye. Yw for taking my looks
See you later 👋
Wtf
Why watch this video if you want him to quit? I don't understand people at all what's disappointing is the comments section nothing but immature hate on someone you don't know seriously get a life maybe and don't click on videos of people you don't like no one forced you to watch if your so concerned about if he quit or not look it up on Google but no one needs the hate this culture is breeding nothing but the most hateful people out there it's ridiculous and yeah im probably gonna get yelled at for saying that but it just makes you look like you have nothing better to do it's just a YouTuber there are definitely more important things to worry about then if someone you really dislike quits youtube
Danm... got all excited for no reason.
Plz leave YouTube
Omg your scary looking!
Now who do you have left in your life?
Thank you comments,  it saved me 11:25 minutes of my life
Why didn’t he just make the title saying goodbye to a friend 😫😐
So clickbait is still a thing in 2021? I just came to comment  and dislike the video.
a cameraman 👁👄👁
Sus perros me distraen 🤣🤣🤣
If he were to quit youtube that'd be my life's greatest moment
Ppl its not clickbait the title jus say "Saying goodbye" not "Goodbye to YouTube"...
I wish you were going instead. I hate you.
Damn you happy now you wont get youtude money? I guess live your life girl🙄✋
I’ll be your assistant Jeff hit me up 🤙 I have no experience but I am fun and a great listener
I wish he quit youtube
I do not care
WAIT STOP🖐🏾 🤲🏾 JESUS LOVES YOU VERY MUCH ✝️OUR FATHER IS COMING✝️TURN TO HIM BEFORE ITS TOO LATE✝️REPENT AND SHARE HIS WORDS ❤ I do apologize for being out of context but his word needs to be heard and people need to repent and accept him as Lord and saviour ❤
So he lost a cameraman and an assistant....
This breaks my heart such a long friendship is hard to say goodbye to something you have gotten used to i hope they have a good chapter in their next part of life many blessings to them.
i dont even know how this is i just checked trending
I thought one of the 1,096,321 dogs died but I was wrong.
Clickbait! It’s just his camera man and his assistant leaving.
FINALLY  Edit after watching this : goddamn it
Blaaaa.   Bla
Awe so much changing, but I like this feel you created in this video it feels so much more like old you especially with this pink hair giving me everything.
Kinda hoping he was leaving Youtube... So glad his cameraman did first. 😌💅✨💕

I was so excited for a second then I read the comments 🥲✋🏻
House tour update pleaaaaase!

You need to quit YouTube. You are darkness and I'm sure to you thats a complement
All you haters saying you're disappointed he's not leaving YT...  You're still watching his videos though 🤪

It's about his camera man? I'm so annoyed at the manipulation I'm not even gonna.
it took me-almost the majority of the video-to realize that those are indeed BOWS in your hair, and not rollers lmaoo
i’m dissatisfied and disappointed bc he is staying
Bye sister 😔✌️
A shame he isn’t leaving
Yo Jefferee ! I live in Burbank/Noho, I’m 25 & a fellow Scorpio! Hire me! 😛😉

#canceljeffreestar
Stay strong Baby Girl !!! Like I know you are !
Talk about overly dramatic

Trade one chris for another?! I’m in NYC though haha 😂 ❤️❤️❤️
MAIN TITLE OF THE VIDEO:  “My Assistant Left Me.”    ....................  The end    (You’re welcome everybody)
Okay thanks for sharing....now it’s ur turn!
Please leave YouTube next time
Wtf I’m I watching.....
Okay bye
😃
Why couldn’t you quit😪
About time. Bye sister 🖕🏻
🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
I will do it hun!! I am trustworthy!
I just wanted to say GOOD RIDDANCE.  Its also funny how ur video starts with an HIV ad..lmfao
no offense but thank gawd....
YouTube is garbage.
he’s becoming more and more irrelevant as the months pass. very happy to see that
This thumbnail is hideous lol
The level of toxicity that’s surrounding him.... guuuuurl. Don’t get me wrong, changes are good but when everyone is bailing on you...
Good I hope so
This whole thing felt like such an act. So awkward..
His ass is so ripped he has to put a plug to the size of a basketball otherwise mess everywhere
So now Jefferee is a vlogger since some members of his team left
Oxygen theft in progress!
great. i liek this
This YouTube is a JOJO reference. So do you have a stand Jeffree joestar
wwow I don't have any words to describe
He's really trying to get his views up huh
Unlikeable
It’s not clickbait really he did say bye to two important people in his life
pauses video, scrolls to comments because i can't bear giving him my watch time
Byeeee
He look like The Riddler from the 1995 Batman movie 😂😂
Gtfo dude I don’t think people cared
loser
Can’t imagine wasting my time to throw shade at someone on YT I don’t like. I’m sure there’s better things to do than spread negativity. . Why even click the video.... ridiculous.
ugh, click bait titles are the worst. I only watch JS content for his review videos, which are few and far between. I'm done. Bye
Spoiler alert.  THESE PEOPLE NEVER LEAVE YOUTUBE.  It's what they do.😂
I hope that you get it all worked out for you and for us soon.  It is just not the same seeing your videos weekly. Life just isn't as much fun without you, Jeffrey.     Take care and remember we need your video's!
Camera man? GONE ! Personal Assistant? GONE! Now that's a huge CHANGE.
YOU ARE WHAT WRONG WITH SOCIETY
Why is this dude dressed up like a girl he needs some boots jeans and go get muddy
Please....we need a real powder pencil again. Just like Lancome used to make!!
Jesus loves you and forgives you for your past choices and mistakes accept him as your Lord and savior before its to late start a relationship with him read your Holy bible, talk to him every day and pray, he is waiting on you with arms stretch wide open waiting for you he would not force himself on you his a gentleman, kind,loving and PATIENCE. Put your trust in Jesus because he is the only one that will never fail You, worship him day and night , be thankful every day despite of😊  Gospel songs Nobody - casting crowns  Michael w Smith- love in his right hand  COMMUNION- TRIBL I THANK GOD - TRIBL  Voice of GOD - Dante Bowe  CHAMPION - TRIBL   There is much more but accept Jesus he loves you and he knows what's best for you, trust his timing, his ways and thoughts are higher than ours 😊🥰💟💝💟💝💟
So many changes in 2020/2021
I wish you were leaving forever.
BYEEE
Yo viendo los perros todo el video jejejejej
The clickbait is strong with this one. Which is how he even stays relevant no offense
“  this is so hard for me but I’m saying goodbye..to my toe nail. Yes, I am going to clip it. I know, I know, you guys are wondering WHICH ONE! It’s been a crazy year “ 😂
Lol. Wish you actually were saying goodbye to everything I mean you're a horrible person.
ifhy just quit already holy shit
I thought you were actually leaving..too bad. Maybe next time.
bye
Some employees and friends moved on. Saved you 11 mins
Didn't West cheat on Kim Kardashian with you?
I'm so sorry that I couldn't listen to your point of this video with the dogs fighting in your background or biting your blanket. How didn't you notice this right next to you? Please prevent this in the future 🇮🇪🇵🇷🇺🇸😷🖤🤟
I'll be your assistant hahaha 😆❤🔥
This video is about lovely dogs in background
jeffree star
So? That has nothing to do with what he does.
i-i know how you feel :(   Kriss leaving you after 5 years                  my favorit teacher Tim after 8 years left me i know how you feel he helpt me throu ansiety and depretion now martial arts is never the same
E is ugly
Freak
I’ll never understand people’s need to be rude online . Like what does it get you? So much more you could do with your time yet you chose to finger bang and say shit you wouldn’t say in real life . Grow up 😅 don’t like him don’t watch, simply block and move on. I’ll always be a fan and I’m proud I don’t waste my time saying hateful things. 🤷‍♀️
I don’t know if you will ever see this, but ignore the bullcrap & keep on going! You’ll find the right people for you! :) I hope you are doing great! Have a great day!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGcL3jHIS-U
A girl needs a new job....I’ll be your assistant! Lol
Thank god see ya nobody even wanted you here

Go date James Charles
Im sick of seeing this guy on my page
This could have been a tweet. It's like the office meeting when it could have been an email.  He is too over the top dramatic over his camera men leaving.  🙄
🤢🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮
Yay yay no perv cams no perv cams yay!!!!!!
have you gotten snowed in today in Casper like i have? wow we had to have someone else go pick up my son from work. totes stuck in the driveway. it's measures at like 20 inches out there! holy fuck! wish i could run into you sometime here in town as i've loved you since MySpace days, but i'm guessing you won't turn up at Walmart lol. i'm more of an Albertson's and Target person myself but i don't always have that cash on hand luxury because i'm disabled. you gunna be hanging out here or in Cali this summer?
🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢

I knew Maddie was going to leave eventually just because for sure assistants are busy 24/7 no time off wishing her the best along w Christian well I can’t wait to see new videos when they come

He really act like recording is hard omfg
Is that a fucking man??!!
Jebaited nothing new

Damn the title was way good to be true
Ok how and why tf did this shit got recommended to me?

Yuk
I can’t believe he quit
male or female, nothing else. sorry to say, but that's what science says! say goodbye to that. without prejudice, spite or malice.
ok
good video but the intro tho lmao ... *sets up phone* i've never done this before  as if there's not 10 people crew behind the camera
Dang hope he actually left😂
ITS CLICKBAIT
“Its been alot, its been alot for me”
Woah this dude is still around!?
Jefree I used to watch you with a smile on my face a few years ago, now you are just “off”, unsubscribed last year. Being super rich and toxic is hard to figure one’s life out. I know you wouldn’t even read this comment or cares, since I used to be your fan and genuinely liked your personality and content, I hope you can find true happiness.
I’ll never see you like her comment because I’m smashing my iPhone against the wall right now. The title was too much
i don’t even watch him wtf
So he’s not leaving earth to go back home?
Ok but why aren’t you following Maddie on the gram anymore then 🤔
Your doing great jeffree ❤️ know your doing the right thing 😇
Clickbait, how low. Even for you.
I love how his English is so clear! It feels nice listening to him speak! non native English speakers will understand me :p I like his energy
u could have posted about this on ur community tab but if Chris is reslly that important to you then change the title aaaaa
Me watching the dogs if they hump 😂
What a great way to get people to click on a video.....
the clickbait is real. Like damn, this is like when Butch Hartman said he was gonna end his channel in 2017, and then said "nope, we're just starting a new era!"
Idk why this is in my recommended
That video of you running away when Kim gets home is hilarious
We love you Jeffree. So excited for new adventures
dang it i thought he was actually quitting
How The Fick did I Get Here!!🤡😂😂😂😂💩💩💩💩💩
Bye
Finally. Peace and blessin
Don’t care didn’t ask
This man is weird idk why this is recommended 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
God damniit. Stop faking people out for views
Kanye moving
Marrying crazy Kanye
Must be pretty desperate to stoop this low for clickbaiting
This is a freaking nightmare!  Run kids!!!
you don't know how emotional I am, bc he is probably the only person I ever watch on youtube and 24/7 and I'm not ready to say goodbye. he has always been my inspiration about soo many things. I just want u to know I love u soo much and i consider myself your biggest freaking fan <3
Stfu
Lol no one cares bro
She left?
I can’t be the only one that knew this was clickbait ???
bye then.
You have helped me through some of my clarity
so many people watching this video commenting “wish u were leaving” imagine giving him views if u don’t support him 😭 good one
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
I was hoping he would say he will finally leave for good but then i checked the comments.... DISAPPOINTED!
Why is nobody respecting the fact that he is actually showing appreciation for his staff and giving them credit. Most YouTubers just will act like they did it all themselves
this dude always be clickbaiting 🙄
😂
I just see people are thirsty for drama in the comment section, boring life much? 🤣
I love that I can click, pause and read everyone’s extremely helpful comments! 😁
His camera man and assistant are leaving. And he said a suspicious about of times, that there's no drama. So... clearly there is. I'd love to see videos from both of them talking about their experiences with him, would cause a lot of drama for suree
Wow!!! You look amazing! I guess you look like the Mexikan singer & actress Lorena Herrera! I feel bad for you friend! We wish her a good luck in her new journal.
Biggest clickbait
damn Caitlyn Jenner looks stunning
Everything is for clickbait and seems superficial or fake anymore with how he handles himself on YouTube. Meh.
Yesd finally  no one like you
hey jef i really love your vids and i hope to be in one of your vids one day daddy jef luv Abdul abed
Sending you nothing but good vibes and positive energy. Keep doing your thing Jeffree you a Star ⭐️
No more fortnite
His camera man left. You can click off now.
Damn. Didn’t his assistant have her own freakin suite in his home? Not bedroom. SUITE.
Leave already
Yes i need a very over complicated 11 minute video of saying goodbye
That puppy is so cute
aww come on man don't post this publicity stunt to make us think you are finally going to leave youtube, your channel is dying and makeup drama is irrelevant so you make this clickbait bullshit, and it worked! You wanted to let us know that your assistant and cameraman were leaving but you KNEW no one would click on  that so you instead put in the title something that got you to #1 on trending, shame on you.
Thank you for your transparency Jeffree. Everyone is going to bitch and moan that you did something wrong but you are the love to my contain ❤️❤️❤️
I was expecting this dude to quit YouTube
K bye .
Same ill miss him to
Finally he’s quitting YouTube.  just watched the video nvm 🥱
jfc...this is why i don't watch Trending more than once a year
you right girl
The only constant is change.
Wow, people are so cruel, shame on them.  No matter who you are, change is hard. Period.   I wish Maddie and Chris the best on this next chapter of their life.   Jeffree, it saddens me that you even felt you had to make this video.. and it's bc of the haters.. negative.. low lifes.. many of them are in the comment section.   I wish you the best with this new chapter..I know Chris and maddie are irreplaceable, but I hope the people that take their places (guuurl, they got big 👠 to fill) are in it for the right reason.   Wishing you and the doggies the best.   💋 Xoxo Michaela
Duuuude!!’ Get it out!!
I got scared by the thumbnail
He’s dramatic about everything what’d y’all expect?
he looks like he'd lick his finger when he'd swipe on his phone
Ew
Cya
He's using his camera man resignation as a means to misdirect the audiencie into thinking he is leaving YouTube for views. He doesn't care about him at all, he only thinks about how to make profit out of this situation. What an awful human being. I understand why they resigned.
I’m telling you rn that he’s not leaving yt so sorry for disappointing some of you but just go and drink some water and find something better to do and save you time by not watching the video     It was just click bait
What the fck am i even looking at??? Literally clicked on this just to dislike it.  Ew.  Good.  Leave.
F’n weirdo
I'm happy i read the comments before the video. now i dont have to watch the video :)
Dont fill me with false hope i thought you were leaving YT
Because I don’t want to watch the video but read the comments: which assistant is it that’s leaving? Maddy?
Jesus Christ our Lord and our Savior, is The WAY, The TRUTH, and The LIFE! Dear friend, confess with your mouth and believe in your heart that Jesus Christ is Lord of your life. Believe in His death, burial and resurrection for the sins of all human-kind and you will be saved.                             May Father God, our Creator bless you in the Glorious name of Jesus Christ our Lord and Savior!! 😊❤️❤️
bye-bye 👀
I was hoping you would be leaving the internet 😒 Another day, another disappointment
ANDREW
WHY R U GETTING THE VACCINE??? Others like veterans are getting their appts cancelled after the first dose?
“Not traveling and changing your whole life routine is a lot”   I haven’t hugged my mom since this all started. Fuck your traveling
Didn’t watch, just came here to say that this dude is the worst
He resulted to click baiting 😔
First corona virus now Jeffery is leaving us what kind of planet is this it will never be the same
Ok Bye, I really thought you were leaving youtube. You will do anything for views. Bye anyway.
Awww after 5 years thats hard ~ my friend is moving in another country so I kinda feel you... and you made a video and there r lots of positive energy in it you are strong !!!
jesus what the fuck is wrong with people to do this to themselves
so dramatic omg
really kinda disappointed, i was hoping he was leaving the planet
wtf v:
Seeing Jeffree without nails... 😟 I can’t stop staring at his hands.
save your time and watch something better. his cameraman is leaving not jeffree. save yourself 11 minutes and 24 seconds
We did it boys
Bye 👋
See ya
i never thought ths would happen
Why is this garbage on trending
LOL I love the hair
This clown wouldn’t be missed if he left.
I love you, and you need to do you boo!! I know how changes especially loosing friends and family can throw anyone's anxiety for a loop. Iam glad you are taking the time to get use to the changes and rolling with the punches. Stay strong  iam sending good vibes for your life. Keep up the amazing work sweetie.
Click bait
oh
For a sec I thout it was a girl when I first clicked it.
Gay
Jeffree my guy that hairstyle isn’t doing any favours for you, you look like a botched version of Princess Leia
what is this guy gay or something?
see this is why I hate people in comment section bc right now all of you are acting irritated and like no-one cares about his explanation. But you ALL know that if he didn't give the explanation, later when he uploads a videos, he would get TONS of backlash for the "quality of his videos" and how he "isn't putting effort into his videos anymore". Like yall find ANY reason to be mad at Jeffree.
Clickbait drama queen
You can see this is hard for Jeffree regardless of what you think.
Lame
Lmao get shit on.
You guys are so mean to him 💔
Ok bye
WTF did I just watch?
A year later back again
I was so ready to go "Byee Bye the drama was nice while it lasted b😊✨😁👋"  Till I read it was the cameraman that was leaving😐
This dude seems gross
Lots of YouTubers film ther own videos and don’t need. A assistant because they can do things on their own so if they can do Then star can do it !
We love you Jeffery shooting star.
Aww. I’ll come film your life lmao. I love  you and YouTube -Loveee you ❤️💜  And great for them. Let them live their beautiful lives xo
I just dont understand why people are so blessed and excited for the vaccine! What about your health?! Your health should be priority, and to not take something that can damage your dna just because of work, travel, and fun 🤨😒
I was bout say adrei trebia got some new video content then i read the comments
Queen
wtf is this thING
Byeeee!
Lowkey the Pomeranians are stealing the spotlight
Funny how you’re are saying that there is no drama, that people need to chill but then you use a dramatic clickbait to get views...
Lowkey clickbait. haha
that camera is amazing
Wish he’d left
Just because we miss you and of course you have ur own life and alot to deal with, anytime i see you put out a video , im always happy to watch you, but eiii Jeffrey needs to feel good to give to us all these good videos, take the time it takes , i know I will always watch suport u 🥰🥰🥰🥰
This thumbnail is funny for no reason haha
I would die to be the new assistant🥺
Damn really hoped this guy was gone ,getting sick of seeing some of his crap and his face appear on the top rated videos. This guy is drama and garbage how can ppl listen to this guy.
You do you girl ❤ ... can't wait for your next video
first his boyfriend, then his camera man, then hopefully him.
Yuck this human is neither woman or man eeeeewww
I thought he was leaving I’m still crying
Goodbye flop, don’t come back
Throw up 🤮
Finally he leaves
Can you hire me as your personal assistant?
love you Jeffree
Good luck on your employee search! Cute puppy!
Casually watched in 2x speed so I can get through it quicker, still not fast enough though.
This world is sinking fast....
new reality game show, Become JS assistant!
*BYE FELICIA !!!!*
Attention seeker... 🙄
I love the hair
Damn I was ready to say bye bitch😂

Is that a man wtf ?
I like the dogs
coming back to this in 3 years 🏃🏻‍♀️
Aw fuck
BYE NEVER COME BACK
Bye gay person
hes still alive damn long time no see
no dont goo, stayyy QUEEEN
Lots of YouTubers don’t even have cameramen, you understand?
Thank god. Also, why the fuck is this in my recommendations?
Lets goo he’s leaving while you’re at it get some fucking therapy freak of nature
I can't wait until MeatCanyon sees this one!
Clickbait . He knew what he was doing. I'm giving this video a dislike and I really don't care.
Oh GOD. I'm now so Gay..
God if only it was you
2020 was a butterfly effect if only you kept your mouth shut
Wow! I am all for youtube and all that it has offered to viewers and to those that make content. I know its been a healthy outlet for a lot of people on many different levels. BUT I never watched Jeffery and don’t know exactly what hes about AND ive heard some of the scuttlebutt that surrounds him. HOWEVER...i am confused.  Does anyone actually like him? AND Why do the comments reflect that viewers were hoping he was going to announce that he is leaving YT? Why does he have a channel? What happened? He was once a “hot topic” and now? Why does it seem like he is not liked? Whats the tea with Jeffery Star? I missed it....🙄
I think Jeffree rn is at a sentimental part in his life/career. He lost Nate, and another guy he was seeing and now he lost two people he values in his life as family to him. 2020-2021 hasnt been easy on him, Ofc he is gonna make a video, could his tweet be reword 100%, but I think he did it to give a small nod and a hug to the people he lost as he loved them dearly.  To mourn the time he had with them and to cherish the moments left in history but to also give a small clap to what the community, that I think, he thought he needed to say. So no, I dont think it was a publicity stunt. I think he was doing it for himself, his own peace of mind, but almost like a public goodbye to the ones he will always love and cherish deeply.
I hate when youtubers say they are  going to be quitting something but never does
https://youtu.be/9VXx8BBqf6c
I’ve never clicked a notification so fast
*click bait*-(coughs)what I didn’t say anything
You need a come to Jesus and repent. I don't think you have a soul..
How dramatic.....
If you are reading this and you are sad and/or depressed know that Jesus Christ brings deep happiness and fulfillment. No amount of alcohol, drugs, or sex can bring as much happiness as Jesus can. Invite Him into your heart and be born again. Read the New Testament in the Bible and meditate on the scriptures. The joy won’t come immediately but once it comes it’ll flow like a river. It always comes as long as you don’t give up in seeking God. Weeping and sorrow may come at night but joy comes in the morning. God bless
“OMG FINALLY.............. wait......... damnit.......”
The clickbait of all clickbaits
Oh hey it's the controversy man
Where do I sign up?? Lol. I live in Georgia but I’ll gladly move!! 😂😂😂😂😭
Ok bye :)
Clickbait

You'll be missed Chris and Maddie 🤘  Good luck in this new era Jeffree. I hope you can find a new crew soon and start enjoying your fantastic reviews that we all have been missing.

Thanks for the clickbait

Why is youtube recommending (whatever this thing is) to me?
Well shit... I thought this clown was leaving YouTube all together...
IDC

Whdn i saw jeffre showed his dogs it immediately reminded of the creep that kissed his dogs on the movie "joe dirt" PUT THE LOTION ON THE SKIN -'buffalo bob'
Anyone else just watching the dogs the whole time
Jesus Christ
Invoker?
Almost. Almost.

Don't get my hopes up like that 😭
Oh no anyways
Clickbait dammit watched this shit so... and all that happened was his assistant left..
Got exited it’s a shame ur staying
He seems sad.  I am not even subscribed, this was just randomly found, but it is probable hard for him. Too bad people are so insensitive.
got excited too quickly
Don't leave YouTube, leave your life
Stop lying and click baiting people to regain popularity
I was so happy when I saw the title and now i'm disappointed :(
Why is this thing still relevant
NO I WANTED U TO LEAVE
Eewwww
I love this
You people are so fucking negative..seriously..Jeffery Star is a successful person and inspirational to a lot of young people..take a look in the mirror what have you done for others?
I was so happy then saw the comments
damn, wish didn't come true
She’s not leaving... 🤤
How about saying goodbye to your career
Thank God 😊

Smh he clout chasing fr
Sickening

Ok bye bye don't come back
This is stupid
Good
was hoping he would quit youtube damn
Sorry I couldnt listen to Jeffree, was distracted by the dogs 🤭
Thanks to the people in the comment section who said what the video is about bc I was not going to watch the whole video.
I got recommended this video and was hoping JS announces he leaves YT. Disappointed to hear it’s his camera man 🤦‍♀️😩
not me being disappointed that he's not actually leaving..
Who else is here after he shaved his head
Click bait has survived the pandemic
I wish he would leave youtube forever, I'm so over his dramatic shit.
Ok? Bye
Are you gey
Sorry that they both had to move on around the same time, but you will find new people to take on these positions and you’ll adapt. Your fans will miss them, too. And we will be here for you as well.  Love you, Jeffrey Lynn. 🥰🥰🥰
Why did I even press on this video lmao
You can't leave
Get references for both positions and consider someone from a film school with a reel. Best of luck.
PLEASE LEAVE FOREVER!!
Getting Michael Jackson vibes from the video photo
Love him but the clickbait is not it
He disturbs me on a hole new Level
So I can’t be your assistant if I’m in another continent? Not fair 😩. ❤️
Bye Christoper 💕
This dude is a weirdo.
Oh no! Anyways...
Upon seeing his face at 0:01, i went full Isaac Butterfield and yelled at the top of my fuckin lungs "holy dooly" because not even where im at in Australia has a creature that's as scary lookin, except for my mother in law.
THE CAMERA MAN AND OTHERS ARE LEAVING BECAUSE THEY ARE DONE WITH JEFFREE AND HIS LIES AND THEY SEE HOW JEFFREE HAS NOONES BACK EXCEPT HIS OWN.... JEFFREE WILL LET ANYONE ELSE GO DOWN FOR HIS FAULTS AND CUTS THEM OFF ..... IM SO HAPPY HIS ASSISTANT GOT AWAY ..... GOOD FOR THEM ..... BECAUSE WHO YOU SUPPORT AND SPEND TIME WITH REPRESENTS WHO YOU ARE AS A PERSON .....
I feel like.. I don't care
You’re a man.
finally
Shitbait.
Jeffree is so fuckin Dramatic, He takes so long to talk about shit. Like just get straight to the point. I am so happy I went straight to the comments. 😂😂😂
Thanks to the comment section.Well,evryone knew that this was a clickbait but still you guys saved everyone twenty minutes of crap!
God luck and prayers your way too! You got this cause you the GOAT!!!
Jeffree I love you!!! Life changes , keep your head up! It’s time for new opportunities!!
Teeee
He always handles his shit he'll be fine👁👄👁
This could have been an email.
I love your video Jeffrey
I've never even knew this man existed and yet it sucks to see him leave YouTube. :(
How tf is this number 3 on trending Some gay or trans guy or whatever he is said his cameraman was leaving That’s it😐
Came to Like cause I thought he's leaving
I'm here just for that cute a** wig🎀🎀
good bye
Tht wig is everything bitch
O-
I thought you were going to say he passed away or something from the tone of your voice
FINALLY
🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
I’d love to be your assistant ❤️  Just give me a shout out  and I’ve had my Vaccine and I’m mature I mean actually mature I could be your mother figure and your assistant and I’m bluntly honest
🤦🏼‍♀️  Oh life is SO rough.   NOT.
I have to admit that every time I want to laugh but I see one of your videos well, but today I have been pleasantly surprised with you and that is that you have not yelled like a greengrocer and you have not made a fool of yourself today if you have a like of mine
gay
I hope I never see what you call a face ever again.
This hair is everything 😍
Girl I know it's hard but be strong...we love you... not everyone but most of us are here for you to support you...
I can appreciate jefree taking the time to say goodbye to important people in his life who contributed heavily to his videos
Sometimes I forget how toxic comment sections are. People complain about wasting time watching a video while they waste time complaining about the video. YouTubers post videos. It's entirely up to you whether or not you want to watch them. Maybe instead of telling someone you've never met how to live their life, just refrain, please.
YESSSS GOOOOOOOO
D i e R a t
WOOOOOOWWWWW 😆
f--k Kanye..then you'll feel better...lol.  <3
عدد لمسلمين 💕
Smh clickbait
The "goodbye" videos begin with dramatic breathing.
I'm sad that it's a camera man leaving not Jefree himself

I thought this was going to be you cutting all of your hair off 🤣
This is one of the most stupid titles I ever read in my entire existence as a human being. It’s ridiculous how clickbait MAKE ME FEEL LIKE A DUMBASS BITCH ALL THE TIME SHIT

I was hoping he was leaving youtube
Tricky way to get everyone’s attention
Chris (his cameraman) has moved on to new work opportunities, as has Madelyn- you're welcome, babes!
Ugh
What the hell did i click on
Is it true with Kanye
Welp...... not  what I expected
K
Why is everyone hating on him for dedicating this video to his cameraman and p.a.? Like, after how long they've known, loved, and assisted him, they deserve this much, they're an important part of his life...
I was completely into what you were saying but Donatella had me laughing so hard 😂
Yall are not real fans.   I think it was nice to have a chat with jeff.  And he looked stunning!
I WOULD LOVEEEEEEE TO BE YOUR PERSONAL ASSISTANT!!!! You are like my idol lol     Annaraebella@gmail.com

Thank you for being so open and honest with its. I pray you will find the perfect assistant and cameraman. I pray for peace for you.
I'm still shocked by he is a man
Ew that wig is just... unique?
bruh
Why is everyone saying "his camera man left thats it" his camera man and assistant worked with him for years i would be haveing emotions around that also.
Wait are you seriously trying to tell me your this bored Jeff cmon now get it together sis no one cares 😬
This is the most important post you will ever read.  Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers.. Yet this is only four of our many transgressions.  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love, so 2000 years ago, Jesus Christ left his throne in heaven and came to this earth. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake.  Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’.. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace..  Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him, and through gratitude in the sacrifice of his son, repent (turn away) from your old way of life. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, your savior, and the ruler of your life from this moment forward (Romans 10:9).   Do these things, and you will be saved.  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife.   You’ve been informed; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you spend ETERNITY, meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make; And all of us here, whether believer or atheist, know deep down that every last word here is true.  Jesus Christ awaits YOU this very moment. Don’t even think about sleeping tonight until you surrender your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed.. And as it is written (Hebrews 9 : 27);  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’.  All glory, honor and praise to Lord Jesus Christ.
About damn time!!!.... oh wait (after reading the comments)  Damn!
Honestly, i regret clicking on this recommended video
why does jeffreye look like he does tho? lol haha
Runnin away with Kanye

Have anyone see his new hair cut and style? Jeffree's back!😍😍😍😍😍❤❤❤
Number #3 trending
Is that a dude!?
You can just tell Jeffree is hurting & for y’all to continuously bring him down shows what kind of people y’all are. Praying y’all remember that he’s still human & he is entitled to have feelings about the changes in his life. Jeffree I’m praying for your mental health, you been beaten down one too many times these past couple years
What is that thing
We're with you, honey. 💕
The way he’s speaking reminds me of donald trump lol
He’s not leaving YouTube his camera man left him your welcome

#3 on clickbait
The thumbnail looks familiar just dont know what it is.
dammit, false alarm. just the cameraman. and here i was getting my hopes up smh 🙄
We wanna know about KAYNE.
We love you doll. We only want to see you living your best life, happy, content, and gorgeous as you are. You look amazing as always. Love, love, love the new look. As for people? They come, and they go. What people fail consistently to mention concerning you, is how many lives that you have enhanced, touched, changed for the absolute better. That... these things, are the things that I will always CHOOSE to consider when I consider Jeffree Star. Love you honey. Anything less than this as applied to you, is a personal choice and the capacity of the individual considering you, and NOT your fault, nor your problem. ♥ Good Luck Christian. Thanks for years and years of fun, sadness, drama, and absolute entertainment, and especially for bringing our gorgeous God-Goddess into perfect focus.
Oh thanks comments lol
Yuck. Why is this thing popular?
Is he a trans or just GAY?

YouTube don't send the video If the video doesn't have more than 10 minutes ur welcome
😱😱😱😱😱😱😨😨 IM NO LOVES SO
I knew it was too good to be true...
Totally off topic but I thought his hair was in curlers until I actually looked up at the top of his head.
You’re quitting YouTube? Great!
I’m glad your going 😂😂😂
Jefferee maybe you should think of hiring one or two in each state so when you travel between states they don’t always have to travel you have a backup. I know covid is an issue right now but I’m hoping the 3 vaccines 💉 they are providing will be helpful. Sending you lots of love & luck! 💕🙏🏻
Je te souhaite un bel entourage honnête et passionné Jeffree, prend ton temps, pense à toi, on t’attend, pas de stress mon coeur, tes vrais fans sont là quand tu es prêt xxxxx bisous 😽
I was hoping you were leaving. For good
Im part of AUTO DISLIKE.

Hello my name is Clickbait and this is your video pointless
Oof🌬️oooh😤ooofff🌪️
Clickbait
No one cares
That meat Canyon drawing was dead accurate
I'm tired of being stared at because I'm a crackhead.
Bye
%$axs1 S -%atfr
No Tea No Shade No Pink-Lemonade
when your views have been down so you do a clickbait video but people are still just reading the comments then leaving...lmao
He’ll be back. Star is the type of person that doesn’t go away from the spotlight and is always looking to entertain himself by getting into stupid drama with teens
Lmfao rest in piss
Long story short: no one actually cares you’re welcome
Whenever I’m feeling bad about myself I’m going to watch this video.  No matter how bad things may be, I’ll never be a whacked out sissy boy with hair like the girl from Lazytown!  😂🤣😂🤣
Hi Jeffree, What happened is you upset forever our gay community saying a gay person is a peoplestealer trying to steal our gay people community from you forever resulted I lost stores jobs, I lost paychecks, I lost medical benefits, and I lost dental benefits. You know I'm a gay person at your gay community forever. You made our gay people community cry forever. You ripped our gay community to shreds forever until gay people are damaged right now. You remind me of my actress Drew's Scream movies series of a woman's boyfriend, whom they had a relationship forever, resulted they liked each other, are later sitting near each other at a bed at her bedroom at her two story furnished mansion watching tv forever, that woman was a peoplestealer, and a cannibal, then a cannibal turned to look at his peoplestealer, then tried to stab her with a knife many times, which she moved many times at a bed. She ran forever. She ran faster, then him forever. She escaped. She survived. You're similar to that boyfriend, and I'm similar to that girlfriend, where we as gay people have a friends gay people society forever, so we're friends forever, then you you upset forever our gay community saying a gay person is a  peoplestealer trying to steal our gay people community from you forever resulted I lost stores jobs, I lost paychecks, I lost medical benefits, and I lost dental benefits, so you tried to jobs killed me, and jobs killed me. I'm dead right now. You tried to make gay people upset killed gay people, and made gay people upset killed gay people. Lets create Revivia Labs Proven Winners colorful flowers, plants, and trees leaves soaps products that I as a sexual gay theater celebrity, and sexual gay theater celebrities are similar use. Lets create flaxes boba tea. I put flaxes powder at white linen filters at a colorful background, and colorful paisilies stone cappuccino machine, and I put Africa's Congo jungle's tropical blue dragons fruits juice, Africa's Congo jungle's tropical blue dragons fruits candies juice, Africa's Congo jungle's tropical blue dragons fruits candies syrups, Africa's Congo jungle's tropical blue dragons fruits candies jellos, and tapioca roots vegetables pudding powder, and coconut milk at the coconut milk area of a colorful background, and colorful paisilies stone cappuccino machine with lids up, put lids down, put colorful paisilies stone mugs beneath it, and press on. Wait forever for fruity flaxes tea to finish. Put at Legend Of The Fall's colorful paisilies stone drinking pitcher is put at a refrigerator is refrigerated overnight to get fruity flaxes boba iced tea. Bye, Erin
Your disgusting
Trans women are not women.  #superstraight
I love your hair
Lurch is back
i was expecting for you to leave youtube😑
Hi those of you from 2025 👋
After I saw the title this is going to be the first vid I liked on this channel
The dogs wrestling and the lack of nails made the video better than usual.
me still not giving a fuck
Only watching bc I know it’ll be on frenemies
Man I wish jeffree left 🙄✋
you'll never give ur clickbaiting won't you?
What did i just watched??
Bye
Bye
MADDIE NO I love maddie to death she is the best. wish nothing but amazing things for this new chapter in her life
The reason why society is getting weaker and weaker !
Talk on street is that jeffreestar is gay
Reaching for the camera✅ Big ass sigh✅ “Casual vid”✅
Ohhhhh bitttch I almost had a heart attack.
Where do I apply 🌝
His career is breaking down from the Kanye Rumours
This is a beautiful hommage to his friends who also happened to work for him and Jeffree keeping us in the loop. Why the hate about this being clickbait, the title is saying goodbye, if you’re pissed because you expected clickbait be pissed at yourself for just wanting bad shit to happen to people for your own entertainment.
can’t even focus on Jeffree. it’s all the babies for me
Hired me am willing.
Love you Jeffree
Do you girl! Glad to see yo sweet face! Can't wait to see what comes next!!
Can somebody tell me what creature this is
All hate aside, life has been rough for everyone these last year and a couple of months, you know... I never liked this guy and never will, but this video for what it is, isn't hate-inducing.  I do however feel genuinely sorry for him losing most of the people he cares for. I said it a couple of videos ago that he will eventually end up being surrounded by folks who aren't wishing him the best of luck and sadly, that's what seems to be happening. Life has a way of giving u what you deserve one way or another, this hardship seems to be the price he is paying for all the lives he managed to disrupt/destroy throughout the years, his controversies, the drama, the hate. It is what it is, I don't wish him anything, except maybe to reflect on himself and work towards being a better person. However, that's me being optimistic, cuze ppl dont rly do any of that these days...
Talk about being a drama queen
What.... the fuck.... is this?
What did he say in this video cuz it's such an effort to watch 🥱
I only started watching this because I was hopeful you were leaving, everything. Happy for your camera man. Sad you’re sticking around. 😭
I was honestly excited but it’s just ur cameraman leaving 😐✋
Is Jeffrey finally going to off themselves? I guess 2021 really has been better than 2020.
😂😂 who cares...
bye sister never come back
so dramatic...."*breathing heavy, places camera down "hi i never done this before...." *BREATHES AGAIN AND AGAIN....
Watched one second of the video to say goodbye in the comments.  Pls "good bye"
Gay
I only clicked because I thought HE was leaving. Well, thank you comments. I got 5 seconds in and now know to just go back to scrolling tattoo ideas.
Such sad but happy news for you Jeffree. I was just running a lovely bubble bath and just thought: I wonder what Andrew (Shane’s cameraman) is doing these days?  I know Shane has taken some time for himself and stuff, so I maybe overthinking it. But you’ve had Andrew around some pretty intense, private and closed door business meetings. You kind of already ‘trust’ him and it would probably help him out if he’s not currently working. Just a thought. I love you guys a lot, Shane included. Everyone makes mistakes and bad decisions (God knows I have), in my eyes it doesn’t change who you are, just makes you more interesting, and if you’re able to say when you’re wrong, then you’re even more of a great person than you already are. I may be over stepping, but just wanted to offer that idea 🤍❤️🤍🖤🤍
Well when you’re a selfish lying bee-otch you’ll scare away all your friends and find yourself alone. No real friends. Just his dogs and his money.
Hire me Jeffery!!!
Awww man I thought he was quitting, that’s a letdown
okay bye
Bye
Bruh I was searching for shein haul and this was in the recommendation 🤣💀💀💀 wtf i forgot about him
MEATCANYON TIME

Thank you Jeffree for letting them go. Some people will do anything to keep their employees to stay, and thank you for being such an understanding person. We stan a Queen.

💉💉💉💉💉 yummy delicious vaccine omg I can't get enough inject that shit into me please I am begging you Fates!
https://youtu.be/X0CqqFshe9w
Everyone is abandoning Jeffree.  The toxicity is too much.  I bet those Pomeranians would flee too if given the chance...
Jeffree you need to fucking chill I know you’re low on views just chill,
Gurl where do you think you're going?
Love you, Jeffree, hope you get good new people in your life❤️
So sick of the clickbait lmao
I’d literally move to you rn to be your personal assistant. I’m not very good with camera technology so that wouldn’t be very helpful but Ive always wanted to be a celebrity’s personal assistant! I wish you the best of luck and can’t wait to see what’s gonna happen next in your life.
Soooo what you’re saying is you’re hiring ?😏
His hair is gorgeous

I ain’t never watch this dude but dang
damn i got excited over nothing
Good bye
The only reason it was trending was because people thought he was actually leaving
Damn it i thought it was u leaving.
Who. The. Fuck. Asked.
Maddie left?!
What the fuck you all are so rude in the comments  He's here to talk to us and "spend some time " with us  so stop making fun of how long he's talkin or how he's not doing the best , he's literally human so have a lil empathy   We love you Jeffree ❤❤
sorry what are you saying im looking at the fluffy dogos
Yay idc
Breaking News so much fake xanax, oxycodone, adderall, hydrocodone and other prescription medications out there. Now  at   https://therxprescription.com/product/buy-xanax-2mg-online/ you can get FDA approved medication without prescription
People are being rude saying “oh my god I wasted time watching this whole video into finding out the camera man is leaving” — like bro are you stupid? Have respect for the cameraman, he’s the reason WHY JEFREE WAS EVEN ABLE TO POST OR CREATE CONTENT THAT WE WATCH.
i really dont understand where the likes are coming from like  how
Fuck I thought u were leaving now I’m disappointed
Honestly you look so ridiculous... so many suscribers, oh my god the world is completely crazy. Seriously a man who is not a man with big balls, a man who is not a woman. Just an individual with stupid thing on his head and horrible makeup. Wake up wake up people ! He speaks like his is a princess... annoying.
So you're not leaving. Damn.
hi im timber im wonder how u do make up
I was about to throw a party bc I thought he was leaving yt 😔
i'll happily be your cameraman or assisstant 🤞🏽
Damn. I thought you were leaving! Don't tease us like that😂🤣
Jeffrey you look like a guy ... never mind you are a guy lmao
What about Maddie? Didn’t she leave too?
I’ll be your assistant 🥺
When your views are so low you have to resort to clickbait how pathetic 😂
Man has a chin that would make the crimson chin blush
Finally
10 of the World's Funniest One Liners  1. I used to have an open mind but my brains kept falling out. 2. Energizer Bunny arrested; charged with battery. 3. Time is what keeps things from happening all at once. 4. Lottery: A tax on people who are bad at math. 5. I didn't fight my way to the top of the food chain to be a vegetarian.  6. If at first you don't succeed, destroy all evidence that you tried. 7. Always remember that you are unique; just like everyone else. 8. Consciousness: That annoying time between naps. 9. There are three kinds of people: Those who can count and those who can't. 10. A flashlight is a case for holding dead batteries.   Editorial: Probably the most thought-provoking one-liner is "Eat right. Stay fit. Die anyway." It's sad but true -- no matter what you do, you will die. This is because you have sinned against God. Let's see if that's true: Have you ever lied (even once)? Ever stolen (anything)? Jesus said, "Whoever looks upon a woman to lust after her, has committed adultery already with her in his heart." Ever looked with lust? If you have said "Yes" to these three questions, by your own admission, you are a lying, thieving, adulterer at heart; and we've only looked at three of the Ten Commandments. How will you do on Judgment Day? Will you be innocent or guilty? You know that you will be guilty, and end up in Hell. That's not God's will. He provided a way for you to be forgiven. He sent His Son to take your punishment: "God commended His love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us." Jesus then rose from the dead and defeated death. God promises everlasting life to all those who confess and forsake their sins, and trust in Jesus Christ. Please do that today . . . you may not have tomorrow. See John 14:21 for a wonderful promise. Then read the Bible daily and obey what you read. God will never let you down.
who even watches his videos anymore? I'm just coming for the comments, they're fun and also someone always posts a short summary of whatever jeffree said 😂😍
Thank God
Would have been amazing if Jef had titled this.."Chris, my cameraman is leaving!; I'm sad but so happy for all things in his future". 🤷‍♀️
It would be better if you were leaving
He isn’t leaving his cameraman is
Whos man's is this. Good riddance
I dont know what's more stupid. Making a video about this or the fact I clicked on it.
Hi Jeffree, I feel like you will tell Britney she's desperate forever, show Britney around town she's desperate forever, show Britney the end of her dating scene forever, then Britney has an emotional dating flu, and physical dating flu forever. Gay people are daters whom tell gay people they're desperate forever, show gay people around town they're desperate forever, show gay people the end of their dating scenes forever, then gay people have emotional dating flus, and physical dating flus forever. Gay people have empathy for Britney forever. Yet gay people don't gay there as empathic people to have empathic actions for Britney forever. Gay people should be empathic people to have empathic actions for Britney forever. Gay people should be Sex In The City tv show dating psychologists, and dating psychologically heal Britney of dating flus they give them forever don't you think so? I think so. Be careful about Britney. Britney is calling you desperate, when she said to your group of gay men, that you're Seventh Heaven tv show's Mormon cheater, Mormon cheating scene, Mormon desperate, and Mormon dirty forever is also from the Kardashians tv show. Try to not be a man saying Britney is desperate is Forces Of Nature's disaster! Bye, Erin
The quality of this  camera is clearer than my future
*only paying attention to the dogs*
I'm so sorry😥
Good riddance
I can be the new Chris. 👀
bro the dogs going ham back there.
Thank you for leaving
8:36 aww you can tell he’s hurting. It’s hard when people leave. Especially the good ones. He’s alone now. No more Nate no more camera man no more assistant. That’s a lot of new changes. Plus he gets hate 24/7. I know it’s hard for him. & I watched the whole video.
Not really
Damn and here i thought youtube was going to be a happier place without his drama....nope click bait ....hope my dream will come true soon
Karma’s sweet 😘 💋
Gross
Bye!
What in the actual f*** is going on with that wig!?
Thank god tired of seeing you in recommendations
That’s a it
I really thought he was gonna say Chris got covid and died like I really thought he was gonna say that 💀
Eww wtf r u
I was hoping u were Saying that u were leaving YouTube. What a shame
Hi Jeffree, I think what happened is I'm a maximum doctor without peoplestealing actions forever caused you as a bunny to bunny jump to say a gay person is a doctor peoplestealer that tried to steal a group of gay men from you forever. At Youtube Webpage Everytime music video Britney is a maximum doctor with peoplestealing actions forever caused later you as a bunny to bunny jump to say a straight person is a doctor peoplestealer that tried to steal a group of gay men from you forever. Personally, I feel our gay community, are sexual people that want sex forever, the key to dating men is sex forever, so our gay community are sexual daters that can sexual date men every year for ten years at our Famous Fix Webpage. Britney is neutral forever at her music videos, and isn't similar to you, so you can see Britney is neutral isn't a sexual person that wants sex forever, the key to dating men is sex forever, so Britney is a conversationalist whom can have conversations with men every year for ten years at her Famous Fix Webpage is talking about a desperate daters dating scene. Those are desperate daters men that Britney has had conversations with every year for ten years at her Famous Fix Webpage earlier. Britney is a peoplestealer trying to steal a group of gay men from you forever, then Britney can't date your group of gay men every year for ten years at her Famous Fix Webpage. Maybe Britney can have conversations with your group of gay men every year for ten years at her Famous Fix Webpage. Maybe gay men only want to have conversations with sexual people every year for ten years at their Famous Fix Webpage. Maybe Britney can't have conversations with your group of gay men every year for ten years at her Famous Fix Webpage. Maybe Britney can't have A to Z people interactions with your group of gay men every year for ten years at her Famous Fix Webpage. Bye, Erin
GOOD BYE 👋🏻
good fucking riddance
Why would people watch this....what is this being
Who else thought he was quitting YouTube
My friends may I share something with you For God so loved the 🌎 that he gave his only begotten son Jesus that whomsoever will believe on him shall not Perish 🔥😢💀 but pass from Death to Life. Believe in the Gospel 1 Corinthians 15 and you shall be saved look to Jesus our only hope and way to being saved from Hell.
Good luck Chris on your new life chapter 🙏
Mom sees video of Jeffree Stars cameraman and assistant no longer being with him! So Mom hurries to tell her daughter, girl, you betta go holla at Jeffree, he will be hiring!! Lol! She has no kids, no husband, nothing but air and opportunity! Whomever gets these jobs, hopefully they love Jeffree as much as we do! For some people, that would be a dream come true!! I truly wish he had an application process! Think about it Jeffree and the team!! Best of luck to everyone!! We will miss Chris and Maddie!! Maddie is so cute!!
Man I wish he’d leave for real... he’s so toxic for youtube
d                                                                                                                                                                                               n                                                                                                                                                                c
okay bye
Why does this remind me of the first episode of Shitts Creek😂
Kanye saying goodbye to Kim
OMG YESSSSSS LEAVEEEE
GG 🦍 #SaveAMC
He is gae he should be taken to the african guy and the african guy asks  why are u gae  Jefree: cuz i like it BEing gae is weird Jeffre beating the sh#t out of african guy...

When he said "I am" I finished that sentence with "gay" 🏳️‍🌈
I wish you did quit youtube.
Thank god
Yes! Finally 😘
U look like Jojo Siwa but having cancer
I truly cannot fathom how so many people have just forgotten what a monster you are. I truly hope all the karma you’ve accumulated comes back to haunt you.
if u can’t be asked to watch this video: his camera man left. he isn’t quitting youtube
you look like Michael jackson if you scooped a little more out of his cheeks and bleached him a little bit more
I cant even watch these videos all the way through. It's so fake!
Hi Jeffree, I replied to your bitches started conversations at your Jeffree Star Webpage Contact Form you wanted. All you will see is I'm a sexual gay theater celebrity woman whom is Jeffree with maximum long eyelashes, and clothing. I'm not sure you want to see what you're like as a woman. Remember to emotionally support our gay community. Try to not tear down our gay community. Thanks for listening. Bye, Erin
Ok, but why is this on my recommended page?
at the start of the vid I FRIKN' THOUGHT CHRISTIAN DIED DONT SCARE MEH LIKE DAT!
I mean he IS saying goodbye technically soooooo lmao

Good
I got too excited
You are a girl or a boy
I'm so sad..you guys made an amazing team! You will find some one. Good luck to both of you! 💜🥰
came, saw the comments, leaving before ad sense ends
Hire me! I have camera experience and a degree, but u won’t :( 🤷🏻‍♂️
K bye
So ur not saying goodbye fr? 😐👋🏾
Dang-  Really hoped Jeffrey just quit youtube
Dogs as bears = girls voice is a boiiii
Jeffree please hire me to the your personal assistant
Lets be honest     We all want his camera quality
Click bait bullshit money grabbing skeletor looking awful excuse for a human being.
Anyone would love to work for you. I know your not looking for job applications, especially on YouTube, I don’t blame you. I must admit I’ve always thought I’d be a great candidate for that line of work and it’s not just me who thinks that many have told me that. Probably because I’m always putting other people’s needs ahead of my own lol, not always a good thing but it’s true but I have no doubt you will find the perfect fit. I must admit I loved watching your tutorials consistently. Please don’t leave us all together darling. Good luck to you love and lipstick 💄
Folks think he only comes on to promote a release....promotes a release.
You made this video in my birthday 😂
Just breathe Jeffery your going to be fine. Remember no matter how crazy LA gets Roanoke VA and Collinsville VA will always love you take your time and chose wisely you make sure they fit you and most of all TRUST WORTHY.
Lol k!
No one knows the art of Youtube like Jeff! The best ever! You are a maestro :)
Less than 30 seconds in and I cringed twice... time to say Goodbye to Jeffree 😂
Omg a YouTuber had to film his own video. This is tragic!!! Sigh!!!
Pin or noob
Finally
Cya later effie
black bear is just chillin
You can trust me... I am not in LA..😋
Accepting all Stimulus donations. *LOL*
LAYYYYYYYYYTER
Illuminati
Am I the only one wondering what Jeffree’s house smells like? Idk I just started thinking about that when he took a deep breath
This is weird
nice you're leaving. Please make it permanent
Jojo siwa????
Gurl I thought YOU was leaving. I was about to be SOOOOO HAPPY !!
Vlogs?🤍
Love Your HairStyle Xxx🤍
I love you Jeffree and wish you the best in the next chapter in your life 💜💜💜
Love Your Hair Style X🤍
Somebody lied to you about that hair 😆
can i be the new camera woman 🥺🥺🥺🥺 PLEASE JEFFREE
❤❤❤❤❤
How many people really wish Jeffree-moon would leave youtube?
Well bye bye then
Seriously, tho, that thumbnail.... though it was that MacDonald  guy who thinks he's a good rapper.
Don't go!!! #YourWaq #Waraq
Before you waste 11:24 minutes of your life hit that dislike button because jeffree isn’t leaving YouTube.
I fr assumed this was u signing off jeffree. Love ur makeup and i feel bad that u became an easy target for past controversies that triggered a bunch of pussies and hurt ur empire that you built urself. #strongbishhh
This is stupid!
Who?
Good for them. Glad they moved on to something more respectable.
It just shows you don’t have to be a good person to get filthy rich
I wanna do that hair look completely 😍😍😍
YESSSSSSS
good
I had to watch this twice because the pups were so FREAKING CUTE!!! Congratulations Chris on the next phase of your career and much luck to him
You're so toxic
Welcome to the regular world....
Really.... "Saying Goodbye" 🤥 More lies,Clickbait and Manipulation. 2 employees are leaving, 🤦🏼‍♀️
Love you millions jeffree ❤❤❤
#2 ON TRENDING
Thank you now leave
Bye girl
11 minutes of clickbait...thought he was quitting youtube the disappointment
I'm here for u jeffree
* SIGHS *
Good
Can I ban a channel from being recommended to me?
Omg did you hear about that thing jeffree Starr did omg I’m so mad
Click bait title, pretty insensitive title in my opinion. But hey this content is terrible so I guess that’s what you gotta resort to
You leave please as well
So, um... if nothing's wrong... why film it with a clickbait title? I was hoping you'd come out and say you'd stay out... Nobody just decides to "move on" if they don't feel like they have to... Stop gaslighting people. It didn't work with Tati and James. Feel the burn of that backfire?.. And, who the hell films looking like a factory-defected discount barbie in a bathrobe?
Bye (won’t miss you)🖤
We could only wish you’d be saying this forever.
I thought this was going to be about cutting your hair.
no, not this you need _BASS_
Guess not that rich
you and Meghan should get acting lessons together.. mehh
brooo goooo awayyyyy
What am I watching
I'm confused with the music in the background sounds like the beginning of church
How sad to be so irrelevant. You need to put click bait titles for people to watch.
Oh, it's clickbait.    Im disappointed.   *But not surprised*
Prayers coming 🙏🥰💗 I love you Jeffree to the moon 🌙 and stars ✨. This was a lovely video. You did a fantastic job. Loved the background view, puppies of course 🥰 and the music was on point 👍🏻👏💞
I’ll film ✋🏻👩🏻
He has his ads on 🤡🤡🤡
Nobody cares
Drama crap
Goodbye bae
Does he think he’s a girl?!?!!
I know 99% won’t care but I hope everyone stays blessed and safe during these times. I’m struggling to reach 1k 😔
Clickbait...
Can I be your videographer?
another pr move nothing to see here guys...
Damn. I thought he was saying goodbye to YouTube🤦🏾‍♀️
not yall saying this is clickbait "saying goodbye..." YEAH TO HIS BLOODY CAMERA MAN AND ASSISTANT
Bruh i thought you where quitting now i'm disappointed
Darn I was hoping we was leaving YouTube for good.
maybe it’s a sign that you should say good bye to the internet
I click to say good but he not leaving just his crew annoying
How annoying 🤢
Thank you for leaving
Who gives a shit.
*Thanks..... good riddance*
Imagine driving your cameraman to quit when people pray for a job during Covid times? Damn...
This dude that plays dress up like a little child is just a scam artist.  Warping little kid's minds and making a lot of money doing it.  For shame.
Romans 7:24-25 O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then with the mind I myself serve the law of God; but with the flesh the law of sin./inspiration+Even though our spirits may be pure and good, it is admittedly hard to stay so owning to our earthly bodies, attracted as we often are to simple earthly pleasures and temptations, from over- eating all the way through to lust. It is here where the battlefield is for so many of us. For in the flesh may be ‘the law of sin’ as quoted in the passage, whilst in our mind resides the place wherein we need to turn our thoughts towards what is best for serving the Lord. /prayer+ Lord God, let not my body falter where my mind may carry me. Allow me to exalt and honor Your name. Give me strength Lord, to resist in earthly temptations, lest they should carry me away from Your Kingdom. Let not my body harm Lord, the true love I have for You within my soul. In Jesus’ name I pray, Amen.
Jail!
Thought Jeffrey was leaving YouTube.   It’s a damn shame he’s staying.
Weirdo...
🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
You need Andrew :)
Once you have the jab, keep someone posted of any weird symptoms. Praying it's quick recovery and good luck finding some good replacements
Lol he makes everything drama lol
What the
LOL good bye! stop making videos please
i don't care
What a click bait. Smh. Narcissist.
Not surprised they’d leave such a toxic environment and person
Jeffree, best wishes as always. I know you're strong enough to pull through these changes and I will be praying for you. 🙂✌👍🙏
Bye lol
Hair looks awesome
🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱
Yawn
i honestly wish he was quitting youtube
finally 👋😀
I thought you were quitting yt-
Youtube ALWAYS removes Deangelo Wallace's big videos from Trending, but always puts Jeffree Star and Shane Dawson's face.🙂
Don’t care
about time
Gosh, you are stunning! So gorgeous 😊
Darn, I was hoping he was leaving!
Trash 📺
k bye
Love how worm Jeffery are to all the people who come into and out of hes life
I deal with anxiety too and also just wanted to share that Jesus has really helped me and saved me and can do the same for you. God bless you and sending prayers and love
The thumbnail looked like a glammed Voldemort
Daaaaaarling we all know how hard it is to get just the right light. 😘
I wanna be jeffree stars assistant oml
Bye bye sucker
You need Jesus.
I used to really enjoy watching Jeffree but after Nathan left things just got really ugly. So sad, he used to be so much fun to watch. ☹️
Leave plss
I was so ready to comment “bye miss girl” til I read the summary. Ig he  isn’t leaving.
YAYYYY
I only kept watching for the dogs . What did he say??
WE LOVEEEEE YOUUU☁️🌸💗😆
The queen of click bate! Get your coin discount mama lol
Goodbye whoever you are xD
Wtf is this !?
Imagine making an 11 min video with a clickbait title just to say that your cameraman and assistant who are a good friends left. i watched this in 2X and still got bored out of mymind.
Why Whyoming please? What's there?  intrigued by this place!
Bruh I thought you were gone already💀
oh, finally thought u were leaving.
Talking about clickbait, damn. 🤦🏻‍♀️
Omfg I seriously thought domi was daddy🥺 she looks so much like him💔
When I read the title I was like 'about time' I'm dissapointed
How’s Kanye
Wait What I am Your New Subscriber Why U act like Girls U are Boy  May be U do This For YouTube No Problem BTW i am New subscriber
Bye!!!
Or did Kanye fire Christian
Queen ✨👑✨
I think Kanye hit him with his lyrics and that's why he is having breathing issues
Is this the most insipid content on YouTube? Mind-numbingly trite banality.
0:01-1:30 lol
Hey
wonder why his cameraman and assistant is leaving :')
And then no one cared
What is that🤔
Got to get away from this freak
Cya
Jeffre you and James Charles should live together and y’all could just do y’all’s stuff together
✨This clickbait is oddly fucky✨
I hate his comment sections more and more after each fucking video. If you’re a goddamn hater get the hell out of here then. All you’re doing is giving him his views. Jeeze Chris and Maddy have been with him for fucking years, there are some of us who have been here since their first day. My fucking god, so sick and goddamn tired of literally readin comments and it’s nothing but goddamn negativity 🤦🏼‍♀️
“ The next people will fall into my life”  *people falling out of his ceiling after sneaking in*  Jeffree “your hired” lol
get lost nobody cares !!!!
Sheeeeeeet🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
Peter Moan is still obsessed with you, he needs the money so stick around.
Literally who cares
I don’t have a family or life you can hire me
Finally
Oh this actually makes sense because you just moved if you said that at the beginning like obviously they’re not gonna want to be in Wyoming for half a year and half a year of a job isn’t good enough
He isn't just a "Cameraman" or just a "Assistant" they are friends. I would be sad if I spent so much time with Someone and they leave friend or not you get used to seeing that person and when you don't it feels different.
Legit a stupid video made solely for views. We get it. Your views have been low notes just fabricate some drama and act like you are leaving. Everyone has seen through this.
Uh so freakish looking,  stop
кто тут русский?.-.
Yes he’s finally gone!!!
never leave
This ducking weirdo would give me nightmares if I watched his videos
wtf is this stupid clickbait
#bitcoin
y’all stop crying literally every youtuber does clickbait
Click bait!!
THANK GOD
How many times does it say amazing and shifts....go......
Everyone: OKAY BYE WONT MISS YOU
My heart goes out to you. I don’t care who you are, you are human and it is so difficult to lose people that close to you! Take good care of yourself!💖
❤❤❤ ... the music though. I'll move to LA in a heartbeat for you, love. Let's workkk <3
“saying goodbye” me thinking he’s leaving youtube: Yes, never come back.
Dont let the door hit your ass on the way out, heheh
H o e
No one cares. Please leave.
What. He's too lazy to film this by herself?! Oh, himself?!
I'm here. FYI
i thought he was finally quitting😭
How could a man dress like a woman?
Where do I apply
got fuckin baited
Click bait.
Good leave. You are a terrible person
Man I really was exited that he was leaving
@believe in the lord JESUS Christ to be saved: stop trolling. No one came to this video OR to the comment section to be “saved”.
It would be nice to be his assistant or videographer
I gotchu boo when do I start ❤️
https://youtu.be/0luqRk6KdF4
love you Jeffree
you got this. the comments are silly. he can post what he wants and if he doesn't wanna be his own camera man that's fine. and everybody is more than likely going through a dark spot so what?
I legit thought his cameraman got covid and died the way he was sighing and not getting to the point
Jeffree is only ALIEN on earth 😂😂😂😂
B strong
Haha haha that’s a bloke
How disappointing!
Good riddance, the cancelor gets canceled
What’s the background music called?
Dramatic
Finally are you quitting I’m not even gonna watch the video goodbye
Gross
Finally
Are you going to come back to YouTube?
Damnit, not what I was expecting.
Shane should be your new camera man!!
Top or bottom ?
Poopstains for sure
Tbh no hate but it seems like he's just going backwards:( I ain ever leaving tho
The clickbait of this vid is unreal🤣 making people think he saying goodbye to YouTube or some shit like that and it’s just his camera man💀
Finally his videos were never entertaining anyways, The only time he’s a relevant is when he is starting drama with other people
hi jeffree :) just watched your video and I don't usually watch and it was so nice hearing your update, you're so inspiring and it just made me feel calm and it was so nice to hear your perspective and i just wanted to say hi in the comments :) xoxoxo
Im sorry i really cant be asked to watch the whole mf vid  so someone tell me if this is clickbait or what and whats hes saying goodbye to:) Ty
Don't give me hope
#RIPBOZO👎😹👎
Deuteronomy 22:5  New King James Version  5 “A woman shall not wear anything that pertains to a man, nor shall a man put on a woman’s garment, for all who do so are an abomination to the Lord your God.  I rest my case
Ok bye
rip
BRO he made it so dramatic  We didnt even need to know  I mean i dont think so  Hope i dont sound so stupid
How does one be that over the top gay ?
Yay stupid clickbait yippieee :/
You can’t be fucking serious.
I have none of those things holding me back as far as working for you. Consider this comment an application if you're interested.
NO ONE CARES
This guy is a freak
Just gotta say that the dogs are SO freakin adorable!!😆💗 I wasn’t even paying attention to Jeffree talking in the beginning and had to rewind the video because I was watching how cute the dogs were playing with each other. I love how they all interact with Donatella😍😍 literally the cutest ever!!!🐾🐶💖
Clickbait awe
I don’t care
I’m glad you’re leaving goodbye
No men will give you a naked hug
Click bait.  Shameful.
I hat you jeefe
Goodbye
Why’s everyone getting so triggered that it’s cLiCkBaIt? This is his personal vlog channel, and he’s entering a new chapter of his life with massive changes. It’s not clickbait, it’s literally just him saying goodbye to people who have been in his life every single day for years... y’all just live for drama.
Tere @jeffreestar vaata @instagram tmi kirjutasin just äsja in @estounia kohta veidi infot.
Is this a man or is this a lady
He has like 3 thousand dogs bro
Jeffree feeling a little bit like blossom huh
You don't in press me.
8 in trending youtube Indonesia now :D
Can you leave... all together
Me wishing this was his last video  Reality: His cameraman quit and there still friends after
Sad that you are not leaving
I ♡ CAMERA DUDE
Major life change.... just loses a camera man
Are you going back to your home planet?
Bye. 🙄
Why didn't this go viral
Dog collector. Hire a dog Walker. Your dogs need activity and something other than sitting on a bed. Look at them..excess energy. Poor things. But, they are just for show . Abusive.
ima miss you
We will be missing you in youtube ms jeffree 🥺
He is a nut.   His videos are garbage
How's your Neopet?
Awww I got excited that he was leaving 🥺 very disappointed 😟 also you stay in a dark place girl... rlly starting to think you ARE the dark 😕
For gods sake
Почему это у меня в рекомендации🤔
He looks like a Batman villain.
...Thats it?  The camera man and the assistant left?  ... Boo hoo, you must have it rough...
-_-
bye 💀
You are a trifle. What you are doing is trivial. Damn you bisexual
Dear lord what a bullshit video this is once again. It's all repetitive. Dear god get to the point
Thanks for making a video telling us this. It was very necessary
I just got clickbaited i click because thought there is girl
I REJOICED when he say goodbye....thought he was finally leaving
Im only focused on the dogs lol
很多人婚姻不幸福，有的是命定的，更多的是自己“作”出来的。三分天命，七分在人。自己不惜福，肆意挥霍，再大的福也经不起折腾的。下面谈谈对婚姻损害比较大的几个主要原因：  一是邪淫，这一点对于婚姻损害最大。  邪淫包括婚前的过度放纵，婚后出轨，传播及过度阅览色情内容，非正常及太过的性行为，比如自慰等。  什么福分都是有定数的，感情之福同样如此，用掉一分就少了一分。婚前的放纵会大幅度消耗婚姻方面的福报，有可能是得不到佳偶，即使得了佳偶也会相处不好。当然也见过放纵之后而得佳偶的，这是各人的福报不同。富豪可一掷万金而不伤其本，贫穷的人，缺几百元钱都会要了他的命。  有一些女孩子说了，年轻时好好疯一下，玩够了再找个好男人嫁了。事实上是，你疯够了，感情的福也消耗得差不多了。没福之后，好人碰不上，再碰到的人都是人到极品无下限。就算侥幸找了个好人，也会相处不好：“都是好人，可我们不适合”，“他对家人、亲朋甚至陌生人都仁至义尽，为什么单单对我不好？”性格因素之外，与自己的福报不够是有绝对关系的。没有了感情之福的人，剩下的婚姻是没有好运而言的。有句江湖话：出来混，迟早要还的。  当然也有人能举那么几个反例，但人家那方面的福报非常大，她浪费得起。你感觉你的福报也大到可以任意挥霍的地步吗？  婚后的出轨，不管做得多隐秘，必然会对婚姻造成种种问题，两人自然就会形相近、心相远，多半生出种种矛盾。婚姻福报重的还好一点，这方面福报轻的，很容易就此彻底毁了婚姻。  还有一样损害婚姻的事，就是自慰太多。直接导致的结果就是感情不顺，恋爱不成，婚姻不如意。同时会导致精神萎靡不振，不自信，记忆力差，不受尊重，被人轻贱，做事种种不顺。  二是堕胎。一般堕胎之后，男女关系就会很快平地起风波，乃至急剧降至冰点，重则导致分手或离婚。这是业力所致，身不由己的要吵要闹，事前什么样的保证都没用。  三是不孝。  包括对父母及公婆或岳父母的不孝，这一点我在生活中及推命中屡见不鲜。不孝会严重损耗人的整体福报，本当大富贵会削减为小富贵，本当温饱会削减为衣食不周、穷困潦倒。天底下的事，没有比不孝更损福报的。这种福报的损耗是全方位的，自然会波及到婚姻。 四是轻率的态度。  这是现代人的通病，以为婚姻像件衣服一样可以换来换去，不知离婚对未来的影响有多大，尤其是对女性的影响。离婚前想得很傻很天真，离婚后才发现，现实的各种艰难，远远超出自己的想象。  很多时候，婚是可离可不离的。大运或流年不对时，比如流年中夫妻宫被冲，或大运伤夫星或妻星，多半会在那一阵子吵得天翻地覆，但多半过了就好了。这种情况，一轻率就玩完了，忍忍也就过去了，不好的年份一过，什么事没有了。我有个表哥，两口子也是有半年疯吵，水火不容，日子过不下去了，去办离婚手续，我大表哥是那单位的，给压住了。回头给他们算个八字，就是流年的问题，劝我那表嫂忍让了半年，过完年又见他们小两口亲亲热热、勾肩搭背在街上逛。  还有的人，以前好好的，到了某些年份，突然变得不可理喻、不近人情起来，让人不由恨自己当初怎么瞎了眼，没看出他是这么个人。实际上哪一年该是怎么样的心性、怎么样的行为，有根命运的线在暗中牵引的，平常人很少有人能摆脱命运的控制的。这种情况，就是短期的心理疾病了。身体会犯病，心理也同样有犯病的时候。命中注定的流年过去了，病好了，事情也就过了。
Tomorrow : I'm back!
I actually thought you were leaving  What happened to the YouTube community?
Garbage content made for the drama queens
Sígueme daddy
I love how people comment about Jeffree and his life in a negative way yet, know so much about his life. You apparently follow him or have seen his videos before so you already know his personality. We all have our own lives to live, stop hating on people for the way they live theirs. If you don’t like it, don’t subscribe and/or turn the channel. There is enough hate in the world today. Have the sort of day you deserve💕👸🏾🐝
I know he said no drama but I want to get his PAs perspective and get the gossip from the cameraman because 💀💀💀
Sígueme daddy
Sígueme daddy
Sígueme daddy
Sígueme daddy
Sígueme daddy
Sígueme daddy
Me at the start of the video: yes finally he is quitting   At the end: God dam for clickbait
There's no other way dear, just go on and move on, be strong, this is the life now, and i love your nails short. Stay safe and sane.
Can I have his job pleeaaseee @jeffreestar 😭😭
😂😂😂😂
Ah.. going to get deprogrammed? Come back to reality? Good for you, bad for the people that have to fix the nonsense though, I feel sad for them.
“Saying Goodbye”  Don’t do that, don’t give me hope.
isnt this this weird thing that kanye fucks with ?
Good riddance
were you in Vacaville prison in California
I don't know... he has always been controversial and a bit crazy and also crazily creative. His make-up is top notch and everyone has a freedom to not buy it/ express his dislikes etc., he has a freedom to behave like he always has, never pretended to be 'oh such a good person and moral compass'. I can't help but like it. His controversy and craziness has consistency or how to express it. To me, he is Salvador Dali of cosmetics. Excellent paintings, made his own genre, yet liked to hide his own shit around his parents or friends houses. Literally, no kidding, look it up.  Extremely creative people do often have extremely instable minds, deal with it.
bye weirdo
Yes 2020 was horrible, my dad and entire world died, my daughter who wouldn’t allow herself to grieve and couldn’t handle it tried to kill herself and on Christmas Eve I was involved in a bad grease fire and was severely burned by oil that was on fire and had to make a decision, let my house and animals perish and get out with just a burned hand (my hand was on fire at the point ) or drop the pan knowing that the 8 inch pan full of flaming oil was going to land on me. I chose to save my animals and home. I could NEVER describe the pain.  2020 for many of us. I am not the same person I was. I am disfigured, having to have major surgery on 12/28 including skin grafts on my left hand, three toes and my entire left leg. The scars on my leg are hideous, my self esteem is so low, I cry all the time and face more surgeries and have to wear burn garments 23 hours a day, it sucks. I can’t do anything.  Trust me I wish I had your problems. I have lost so much. I have never bitched or complained, but be thankful for what you DO have. I know you are thankful it just seems overwhelming but even I think it could be worse.  You can still have them in your life to see on some level, you have your health, your home, be grateful. You have so much going for you.   I know I will live with these scars forever and will never take back my decision, I suffer from PTSD , GAD and MDD now along with pain. I went to the dentist (I have several issues like you had) and even with insurance they want 15k and we have good insurance. I thought if I had to have these hideous scars I could at least have my smile back and they dangled a carrot only to pull it away.They acted like they cared and were going to help and I left crying with no help. (Dentists want money, they could give zero $hyts about their patients, but kept saying oh you have wonderful insurance as  I sat there tears in eyes, but we won’t give you financing AND WE WANT THE 15 k NOW) Something I physically could’ve fixed to help my self esteem a little, got taken away and had my Daddy of been here he wouldn’t  have batted an eyelash to help. Now I am helping to taking care of my mom. Who is going through it, they would’ve been married 54 years 4/15. She and my daughter are the ONLY two reasons I have not checked out from this world. I would lie if I said I didn’t think about it.  Sorry this is long  and I am BAWLING as I sit here and write this, unable to sleep due to pain, but you are SO very blessed, I would give ANYTHING to have an ounce of what you do, shit even gorgeous teeth and smile like yours.   You will find the right people fill those positions.   People come in our life for: reasons, Seasons, or Lifetimes.  Oh if anyone is sick enough to think I am lying about my injuries , first you are a disgusting individual but you can see my journey on my IG, you don’t f****** lie about your daddy dying and getting flown to TGH for a grease fire on Christmas ,ever. Be forewarned the pics  though IG approved are not pretty. @dontfeedtheunicornz  Much luck and blessings to all in 2021! 💜
Never clicked so fast.
Never clicked so fast.
Cute hair tho
Leave my recommended
This chick is a fuckin piiieeeecceee !
I feel the sadness
اللهم اني اعوذ بك من الخبث والخبائث
He deff needs prayers

DANG he always wanna apologize  wearing some expensive ass clothing and showing his luxurious stuff. Like we know u rich 🙄😭🤚🏾
Good riddance
We scares me and I forget his name so his new name is skeletor the destroyed no need to thank me
The comment says. . . Hey everyone. . How are ya? Today it's time to say goodbye... There has been some major changes  in my life recently. Thank you for watching and being patient. Love you guys so much.  Show more? BOOM  Happiness cuteness            Why did I make this ;~;
If only you were leaving, and that shite hair with you wtf is that
What in god's name is this shite, and why is it on my feed?
Weirdo
*Bye ;)*
I was hoping he would leave 🙄
You hiring?
Click bait
Anyone tell me, who is she?
I’m actually more disappointed that it’s not Jeffree leaving YouTube LMAO
Why was this on my for you page??😂😂
❤️❤️❤️
Why was this recommended to me?
Good riddance
Who what and why is dis recommended
Respect for Chris R.I.P
aw i was so excited after seeing the title :/
Please tell me Star is going away...is it true?!?
omfg i was hoping he was gonna leave yt
Click bait clown 🤡
Don't care 🤮
😍 😍 😍 😍 😍 😍 😍 😍
How the fuck does this have 3 million views 😳 what’s the world turning to
Jeffree Star saying good bye just because his cameraman left. 🙄
Pls use some of that $ to get those puppers some swim time. ❤️
Get marrie
thx to all the ppl commenting the basic idea of this i dont have to waist 10 mins of my life now u guys are true heros
Freak
when is this thing getting cancelled ? asking for a friend
Me watching the dogs in the back ground the whole time
i hope this was his suzid note
Jeffrey is a copy of my 12 year old little girl cousin. Why am I watching this
I really feel like you need to look at yourself realistically, Jeffree. People are walking away from you. Key people that have been in your life for years... Chris, Madi, Nate. People see you. You can say "no drama" as much as you want but clearly all of these people have had enough. The ranch, the mansion, the cars, the Louis crap... we get it. You're successful, congratulations. But are you happy? You've lost touch with reality and where you come from. Get it together or you'll end up alone with nothing but your "stuff".
These comments are annoying. If you don’t care, don’t watch it?!
is this gay?
Let me tell u something. Let me tell you something..... we dont care. We dont care
Lmao noob
Haven't even watched the video nor will I but I sure hope the title is actually true
Read. The. Room. before posting about your 1st world problems in a horrendous wig
if you  left am not going to miss you
I was so hopeful this video was him saying he was leaving.
He made all of youtube excited for a minute there.
Is it necessary to make a video saying your camera man is leaving? 😑
Goodbye
7:40 "so I've been spending a lot of time  at  my ranch in wyoming, and a lot of people that work for me cant live there  - they have their own families and lives and pets, and me changing my life course has also changed other peoples abilities to live - but girl the suns setting behind me, it looks amazing..." jesus christ. You are so clueless and soulless with everything you say.  it can be a lot for your soul omg. zoom in on your face real quick wow omg. and compare the loss of human jobs to you raising a puppy?! are you sick? and your family has been out to your new ranch? are you listening to yourself?.... you know you're strong? are you breathing the same air your ex-employees are? you get told to read a statement and you read it and you want us to feel bad?... and if we made it this far into the video? like its a strain on your viewers? you are literally expecting your viewers to accept everything you say with no questions asks because they are your fans and youre in a robe?..... and you say pray for you? PRAY FOR YOU? are you kidding me? and you joke that legit career-building platforms like linkdin or other platforms are unrealistic? and you laugh at those platforms? and like its some kind of inconvenience that the next line of whatever cosmetics is the biggest inconvenience that you really have to cut off your video in mid sentence? are you that power hungry and aware you choose to tell your editor (who has a job) to do that?
That was nice of you to talk so honestly of your workers and appreciate what they have done for you.🙏👍💝🌹😎🇦🇺
Omg aww we love Cris and Madi  You would be a great boss to work for to have you name on there resumes wow what a door opener
Okay so im new here on this channel.... Question.... Why does everyone in the comments hate jefree? Did i miss something?  I am very confused. It seems like there are more hate comments than there are good ones lol
What a freak
Bye
pls jeffree get off the internet and check yourself into the psych ward for a while
Why is this trending?
I thought he was going to say "I am..." a confused gay
He ain’t cancelled yet!?
They don't these people seek help
This  is what we get when we do trivalise our lives and culture.
Good one less weirdo
tf is this shit
So glad it was just that. Yay we will continuing getting videos! Cancel culture 🖕🏽
Haha ein man als Frau 😂😂
So sorry you are saying goodbye.... I covered this on my own channel about darkness, and I picked this up intuitively.  Love you xxxx
You’re so genuine. You’ve created life changing relationships and now that they are gone it’s a huge change for you and them. This is the real you & we love it.
Damnit, thought this was him quitting YT
pray whoever is reading this becomes successful in life
finally hes quit
I love you,your so awesome. I hope your future days gets better, iv missed you talking to us and helping with our makeup.I wasn't schooled on how to do makeup and I look forward to your just sitting and showing us how.,pleasestay positive..I'm enjoying your pallets and lipsticks and glosses smelling like cake iceing💜💜💜💜yum.! I don't trust people either I don't have friends.because of life scars.its a positive that I can watch you it really makes most down days better.
2 people leaving at the same time
@youtube... Your recommendations suck ass. WHY TF would I care about this?
The amount of deep breaths in the first minute or two is insane
Wig is great
I’m happy I’ve unsubscribed a year ago 🙂🙂 coz you are not worth of my 11 mins and 24 seconds time. And also I’m glad I never bought any of your overpriced products.
I’m just watching the dogs 🧍🏾‍♀️
freak
White people problems + Identity crisis = Who gives a shit.
God this is stupid. Y'all,  the cameraman dipped. That's it.
What shit
1. Make an elephant out of a fly. 2. Make sure it's over 10 minutes long. 3. Cash in dat sweet sweet Youtube money.
So, Jeffree isn't leaving YT? That's disappointing.
Click. Bait. Enough said.
Fucking hell. What total BOLLOCKS. This planet is doomed
That robe is really nice. Unfortunately I'd just ruin it with ketchup from my bacon sandwich.
#HOGE Finance 🚀🚀🚀 to the moon get in now or miss out
Good bye christian... We will miss you. Good luck with your future endeavors.
More ASMR?
I don’t give a fuck, get this off my feed
This is FUBAR on so many levels click bation FUBAR. 👎
💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗
Goodbye, lol
I’m so over Jeffrey, YouTube can you please stop recommending this fake unaccountable alien. Thanks.
Great, clickbait.
Yall say dramatic but what other employer ever gave such good reviews to their employees and made it clickbaitable to the point that it got to #1 trending???
I randomly scrolled through YouTube and got this. Is this a joke? Is this guys trans gay bi? What the fuck is this? Alien??
*pulls out youtuber emotional video bingo sheet* looks like I can already knock off starting the camera when it’s not ready. Let’s see how much we have left
This is why nobody likes youtubers like this 🤦🏽‍♂️
His hands are so beautiful without the nails! Nothing wrong with the nails he has normally they are cool and I like them but it's so strange to see the hands without them. I think they look beautiful both ways!
No animals or boyfriends or anybody were hurt in the making of this video Just a camera man left..
Damn, this got recommended and I was hoping it was you saying goodbye to social media forever. Bummer.
hey Jeffree, I dont usually comment but I think I have a good suggestion regarding your vacancy. I'm from Ireland and I study in Film production, it would be life changing for a student in film to be honoured with such a position! There are a bunch of film schools in la!
☠️ jeez don't make it so dramatic when it's just Ur cameraman u can survive
WTF! Who recommended this? What complete and utter trivial shite. Who cares. Idiots. 🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡
I’m tired of this guy already why is he relevant again?
so his employees are sick of the bullshit finally ..
I dont like or watch Jeffree Starr but telling from the comments he wasted so much time the first few minutes was just him breathing every 2 seconds and repeating himself like wtf
he isnt going anywhere,like "High,how are ya"
I saw the title and just went "thank God." To bad it's clickbait
Fuck outa here and go to the mega gay zone
Stay away pls
I couldnt stop looking at donatella the whole time, shes so cute 😍
😐😊
Garbage
🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮👋👋👋👎👎
I’d like to insert the “Let me pretend I care, okay, I’m done.” meme here.
“He’s only saying goodbye to his camera man 😭😭” SORRY y’all expected for him to just come on with some huge scandal or situation. STARVIN FOR SOME DRAMA 😭😭
k. did i ask-
Looks like it's time to throw away my party planner kit.
aha he's become so irrelevant i knew he'd make something like this:I
So dramatic over his cameraman leaving
Stfu please
Please Don't Come Back. Retreat.
Finally
And of course the sad & tired drama channels are all saying that JS is saying goodbye to YouTube completely? Psh. But what else could we expect?
Get this man a Oscar because he’s acting is amazing
Thx
Everything started with wyoming. He’s greed drove everyone away. Look at the wyoming house tour video, jeffree looks super rich yes, he’s got the massive house yes but he’s just sad. He is ALONE at the whole house. Even he bought bunch of dogs for dont feel lonely. OPEN YOUR EYES.
FINALLY
Just disappear
Wow 2.9m views, im amazed.
brave girls got their first win!!!!!!!!!!!
Good I'm glad ur leaving ain't no one wanna watch guy girl on YouTube 🤢🤢
Why is no one talking about the wig??? It's so cuteeee😍
I can’t be bothered watching did he quit yes or no
How is this related to "subway sexist"
No one talking about the DOGS 🥺 They are cute ☺️
The only thing I’m paying attention to are the dogs. That’s all I want to see.
you don't need a camera man. just put 3 cameras in different angels 😁 💪
اَللّهُمَّ صّلِ وَسَلِّمْ عَلۓِ نَبِيْنَامُحَمَّدْ ﷺ❤
Please I thought he was leaving YouTube omg
Jeffree I know it is hard to say good bye to people that are special to you! Whoever comes into your life will be so blessed to have you in their lives! Praying for you love you! ❤️🙏🌈
This is really disappointing, I really thought you where going to leave...
Cya
The binaurals playing in the background. Why? 😂
You are no good
Clickbait xD but hey, new jobs open! I hope the next ppl working for jeffree have to have a thick skin for his crazy lifestyle. Good luck y'all!
good riddance trump people need to just go to Antarctica
Pogchamp
He makes me feel sick....totally skeeves me out.
His family must hate him
im so tired of clickbait
The dogs fighting were literally so distracting idk anything that happened in this video
Кто она такая, и что она делает в трендах на первом месте ?
The facts that there’s no ads I’m shocked
Nobody cares :):
Why tf is it no. 1 trending . Rosé’s song should be no. 1
👎👎👎👎
If his personal assistant left without drama, why did they unfollow each other on Instagram? Just curious
Freak show continues
Ok.
First video of yours i have watched bruh
no bc did he actually just say "yeah ik people are dying and loosing their jobs and shit but like even though i'm rich and privileged it's been soooo hard for me bc my camera man left!!!!"
Ur weird bro
This is really boring
https://youtu.be/PDj4YOGncvc
Why i always notice that jeffrey was always blooming 🤔😊
Wtf
Not sure why this was recommended.
BYEEE
Who cares about jeffree Star I'm more interested in his dogs
Bye weirdo. 👋
I'd rather have Shane back at this point. People dug too much into past mistakes and kept hammering him with it.
Lanche eu não sei qual é o nome mas estou falando nos comentários o que eu estou aqui aumente a fazer lembre de ação com você eu queria muito de você um euro e o você beijo te 🥰
Good....we need fewer weirdos in this world
Deuces peace goodbye you  Rothschild
💆🏻‍♀️
Thank you comments for saving me 11 minutes of my day
Crap. Got my hopes up. Can we keep the camera man and get rid of him instead???
Oh my god what a mess
be yourself
Who all thought  that jeffree was leaving YouTube after reading the title...
I skipped to the last 30 seconds then went to the comments, honestly cba with clickbait
Soo sad to see 😢😢😢 From India 🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳
You look horrible
Can we stop judging him he might break down as soon as he turns the camera off so please can we appreciate even tho his camera man has gone he still is going
I wish you would say goodbye for good
So obnoxious leave my feed plz
Summary: (not a hater but just observant)  > Click-bate Title: He ain't going no where... > First statement was a not ture:  "I've never done this..."  > Researched his Channel: (pre-curls and hair and surgeries/Tattoo(s) there are plenty of his previous work which was recorded by him and uploaded as well, along with some editing which he talks about. > What I learned Learned about him and this Channel: that He is Cleary a very likeable person,  Resilient, and loved what he does which he has created into an Empire. WELL DONE BTW (get ur paper boo boo) however, the behavior change in his personality now from where it was years ago seems to show that the bigger he gets, the more Unreasonable he gets to the average viewer.  Again, well done on ur success and making it to this level where this has opened up so many more opportunities for u and ur team along with thousands of ppl who r learning from u.   Lastly, most ppl watching these videos are clearly not living the lifestyle that u are so I hope u stay greatful and continue to share your life with the world. Positivity is needed in this word and our species is running out quick but this helps...    Honestly, I need a Career (not a job I already have that) if ur still looking to hire... @jeffreestar
Kanye West will be the PA.
I’m just here to say, it’s your life do what you want no one cares
No one : Jeffrey:good bye
I got scared 😨  I thought you were leaving us!!!🥺🥺🥺🥺😬😬😬❤❤❤❤
nice clickbait. very sad top youtubers rely on this to become trending.
https://youtu.be/I7zGIwGgvNI
Am I the only one that ignored Jeffrey this whole video I literally ignored him the whole video and watched his dogs fight😂✋
I just want someone to summarize a long ass video in a sentence coz that's it I don't care much. Cut the crap.
no matter what, we will always love you Jeffree
sAyInG gOoDbYe
https://youtu.be/QxvAHnOodg0
Clickbait  🙄
Just stop with the click bait
Not in 4K. Cameraman left.
You are sooo beautiful 😍😍😍
Such an over dramatic person. Title what looks like he is leaving. But it's just his assistant and camera man? Wow. Just because of wanting more views faster. Was hoping it would be himself for awhile😂🤷🏻‍♀️
And i don't even have a 4k option
Okay but like how do I become a personal assistant...I'm 22 and will drop shit for this
Bye
Well this was weird
okk :no one nooo one! pov: you clicked on this cause u thought he was quiting youtube
Shit, I was hoping this was the first of many vloggers quitting and ending this medium from entertainment, but with the 35 and under set pushing it towards status surpassing movies and TV, guess it was just that..............  HOPE
Stfu I didn’t even see the video and I already know this is shit
Jeffree Star we always love you. We know that many people will stay and support to you every day.
For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? Mark 8:36 KJV  For it is easier for a camel to go through a needle's eye, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God. Luke 18:25
I am willing and able to be your personal assistant  I love you 😘
Gross.
i was watching the dogs the whole time

This is my 1st time seeing him and his Pom's. I have no idea why it was recommended other than I also am a Pom Mom. I have 2 of those little terrors right now along with a pom/Chi who is Boss!!! They are my 6,7th&8th pom's in 21 years. We will never have another breed. Yours are gorgeous!! We've have all black,all cream,brendle and brown colored. Our first qas 24 pounds!! Not over weight just a huge Pom,but he was so còol!! People used to offer us money to buy him all the time,but we would have NEVER even considered it for a few million!!! He was a special dog!!! We still miss him and its been 6 yrs hes been gone. Our male now is so much like him, its like he was reincarnated.I slip and call him by his name quiteboften.He looks up at me with that same look of. Wtf do you want mom??? Lol my girls are sisters from the same litter and very close. Bossy little wenches. Lol.But my male is still king pom/chi!!!! What he says goes!! LOL. THE Pom/CHI COMBO Is one beautiful combination. Zhis name is Sammie.He looks like a full Pomeranian..but regardless.He is a beautiful gorgeous dog!!!!
Let’s goooooo

Man, for a second - before you said that Chris was leaving, I thought you were about to say HE DIED. Gave me a mini-heart attack for a second there.
he made it so dramtic on insta wtf lol
I accidently clicked on this while scratching my ear, and for 3 seconds my entire house was filled with the sound of jeffree star moaning. Please have an awful day
Gutsy for him to leave the comments on-
Hi Jeffree Star  You Are The Best, Awesome And Amazing  Gay YouTuber In The Whole Entire World Love You To The Moon And Back Forever And Ever From Your Fans In Canada XOXOXOXOXOXOXOXO
Packing my bags 🤣🏃‍♀️🏃‍♀️🏃‍♀️🏃‍♀️🏃‍♀️

Oh my good god Jeffree.. This is just a big big nope. There's no need for the intense drama and mystery all for your damn cameraman leaving?! This is a little reaching... thirsty... its dry... very very dry hun... smfh. I'm truly truly so disappointed in you for this click baity tacky post... I still love you, but GIIIRRRLLLLL!!!

I clicked on this video cause it was on trending and I just watched the dogs the whole time :)
This is so disgusting
Reality log... does it even matter? What's the point of recording these logs if you're not going to listen? We've lost control of the Zero Point, do you get what that means? You must not because you're doing nothing! I've dedicated my life to the Order! I've given everything! And for what? To just sit back and watch Reality end? That's not who we are! At least it's not who I am. Not anymore.
Wow what a waste to find out he isn’t leaving youtube. Such a disappointment😂
lmao. I just felt trolled
Damn i was hoping he was leaving youtube
Clickbait 🤦🏼‍♀️
I was gonna be like OMG finally and then a read the comments saying that the vídeo was about his camera man

🙄
Love you Jeffree ❤️❤️❤️
First of....WHEW!!!   Thought you were saying goodbye to us lol.  Secondly, take the time to do what's right for you, and breath.  Things will fall into place for you again, and we'll be here.   Good time to get in some therapeutic spa time to take care of you.  <3
Bye
Read the first comments and it ain’t worth it!? It’s about the camera man lmfao

We don’t care. U could literally just iMessage him lol
Who else just watched the dogs the whole time
Fuck. And here I thought this video was about him leaving YouTube. I’ve never felt more disappointed.
DarkViperAU will make a response video about this, yelling to the top of his lungs about how he's losing money because of Clickbait.
Gross
Can’t be bothered to watch the video but happy days good bye let’s get rid of all the toxic people on YouTube.

For some reason I feel like this is gonna be a good change
bye bye demon
He could have put him in the video so we know who we’re saying goodbye to 😒 This was just for views 🙄
Jefree.  My camera man is leaving Also Jefree   Proceeds to film straight up his dressing gown!!
*Hey, to you reading* ... you are loved in this moment, just as you are, here's how we know: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”
So lovely youtuber. Yor camera is loving your welcome🥰
Please leave with him.
Basically the entire video is him just touching the two strands of hair on his head.
The level of clickbait tho...
👹Remember🥵our😜song😭ive👶been💩crushing👾🎶 👺PIPER💩DO😉YOU😈REMEMBER😩 STOPPPPP😭*dies*
Yo why's this camera quality so damn gud?

Tell satan i said wassup 😈
Dude, your a guy....what is this.
It was too good to be true 😔

I'm truly disappointed in youtube for recommending me this.
Come on ppl dislike this shit
Can't believe how toxic Jeffree is
Cute hair!
i don’t know who the fuck jeffreestar is, but goodbye.
Wow YouTube! get this clickbait-y ass video off #2 on trending- yikes.
His boyfriend, camera man, apparently..nail person, business partners, friends and whoever else are leaving him... and he still acts clueless... yikes 😬
...This person is extremely fake and it feels like they're lying about some things and exaggerating about other things and possibly they're a narcissist? LOL IDK, just how they hit me in this video. I couldn't stand it so I stopped watching at 2:08. Ugh. THAT was "too much" because THEY are "too much." Just... fake.
SHUT UPPPP
THE TITLE IS SO CLICKBAIT
Who cares why YouTube pushing freaks
Was really disappointed when you said it was the cameraman, and not you ☹️
I remember about a video from rich lux talking about the house of jefree, loves one will go etc etc I dont know it just came to me, first nathan, next was it his hair stylist? Now Chris and his PA  was it just a coincidence?
Not gonna lie...you and a camera just feels more personal...try that out for a bit...it’s kind of nice without all the production...stripped down is a vibe...
I just watched the puppies the whole time :-) so cute 🥰
this is what happens after being a shady person for the last five years especially
He’s not leaving YouTube his camera man is leaving your welcome    ⬇ ⬇
Why is this recommended 2 me. Yall lmk when he find another black man to defend his case wit
Im distracted by the dogs in the back. Cant even concentrate. 😂😂
thank fuck
I don't think I never even seen chris. If anybody has can you just leave me the link so I can see what he looks like. Just curious.
Sorry don't want to know
Jeffrey "👁️👄👁️" star
I love how he just HAS to pull that baity youtube bullshit title of "Saying Goodbye..." all dramatic with the periods and shit, misleading ass title, etc. when it could've been titled "Camera man is leaving" the clickbaity bullshit to lure people in is so cringe. he doesn't need to bait people he easily gets the views without it i don't understand - shout out to the youtubers who don't do that shit
WOOOO
Why not Andrew?
“It’s very hard to trust people” Me: No, it’s very hard to trust you.
YES!!!!!
Here I thought he was quitting...........toodles
This is so extra lmao
Why are you back leave please and thank you.
L
WHY ARE YOU SO GAY
At the end of the day if you find yourself alone maybe your the problem..... bless the people that escaped yo crqzayayayay asssssss hunty
Too everyone who says it’s just his camera no it’s not just his cameraman if you are a Jeffree star fan you are also Christian fan and Christian is not just his cameraman he’s  also a close friend imagine having someone with you 24/7 for 5 years and now they are leaving he was more than a friend he was like family to him. As much Jeffrees fans are crazy about Jeffree they are also crazy about Christian we love it when Jeffree mentions Chris through out the the video okay? And everything is not about drama and attention and the bitch attitude he’s human after all of you can’t see how sad he is in this video than seriously you have Judgment issues
Disgusting
Animal crossing x colourpop please 🙏🥺
Byeeeeeeee
I’m pretty sure this dude might be gay
Who cares.
🤨
Are Lipstick Nic and MMMMitchell gone permanently too? Or just staying away over Covid?
Ayo why is the title so dramatic?
Ok bye 🤡
Bye                     Still there...BYYYYYYE jeffree
Finally
Even if you only did a video for a new product. What's wrong with that. It's a platform to get info out and people to see the product in use and up close
Chapter 1. LEAVE IM NOT EVEN A MINUTE INTO THE VID LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Tbh, nobody cares.
Knk Kerimcanı takibe almışsın 😅❤️

this video will probably get recommended 5 years later so anyone from 2026?
He seems like he’s on something or drunk
I've never wanted to be a pomeranian so bad in my life
man I got excited until I heard he wasn't going
When a song with Polo G & Yungblud is below a video about a cameraman
2:00 (also there is no tea his camera man is just leaving the channel) also 2:00 is when he says it btw! Have a great day/night
What the Fuc# is that.
Jeffree! I met you 2 years ago at Behind the Brush. We discussed me working for you. I gave you my resume and Maddie hung onto it. She’s so sweet! I’m still ready to film with you 😉
How come you and Madi don't follow each other on IG?
Avoid capital one financial products if you can! Choose a local bank card, or even a less insidious multi-national conglomerate. Kapital one is an intrusive brand and should be avoided like the next pandemic

Fuck. He got my hopes up. I really did believe the cancerous YouTuber known as Jefree Star was finally leaving YouTube. Guess that one’s on me!
How is he getting the vaccine?? I have asthma and work with the public and I’m not getting it anytime soon I’ve checked no hate but how was he getting it ?
Damn I've never been more excited and then so disappointed about a video
Why can’t you just admit you’re two faced and you treat people horribly?
never clicked so slow

Jesus is King. Jesus Christ died for our sins so we can have a chance to make it to the where the path of righteousness leads (heaven/eternal life). I highly suggest you repent and take the Gift! 🙏🏾💙🕊
When your cameraman leaves you:

Bye sister! 🖐️😒
If only this wasn’t clickbait
What about a Jeffree Star setting spray again, I am missing my go to setting spray ☹
I can only focus on the brown chihuahua playing with the little one so cute
What the fuck is this??? The world has gone to shit!!!
Damn I thought you were purging yourself from the internet. Thank you commenter for not having me go through the pain of watching this trash
Damn it I got excited
Oh no, I feel SOOOOOO BAD! /s
Moral of the story is: You're trash and everyone left you. Got it. Can't relate. 💅🏻
Good bye Sir.... God bless
Drinking game: Take a shot every time Jeffree sighs
i wish it was you leaving youtube forever
Love you Jeffree always and forever💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗
my god you're annoying
Go to hell.
No offense u sound just like urself in meatcanyon
Why that thing look like a dried up peanut?
there was no reason for this video to be this long
Wtf
https://youtu.be/H3JrdCtB7Rk
Love you Jeffrey ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Hate the hair 😂
Love the dogs
Love the robe
**tiffany pollard voice** BYEEEEEE PUMPKINNN BYEEEEEEEEEEE PUMPKINNNNN
I love your hair
ok bye lol
Saying bye to the camera man and HELLO to cocaine
Nothing is too personal Jeff!!!   But like also we would never know if you didn’t make this vid!!!
I like Jeffrey!! I am big fan of you!!
Can you say click bait ???
Nice! FINALLY! BYE FOREVER
This nigga really said "wooh" like 8 times in the first minute
You look like orochimaru from Naruto.
When I see Jeffree. I see a very lonely person who surrounds himself with dogs, because they won't judge him or leave him. Remember hurt people hurt people.  I actually feel sorry for him. A lot of people don't realize that being rich doesn't make you happy.
Jeffree is ‘sharon-stoning’ throughout the video.
Does Yesswy   swallow
Astagfirullah wht is this. Turn to Islam.
Okay, go
ONE DAY I WILL MAKE A SONG WITH THE WEEKND 🎲💯💫🌃....
I got my hopes up I should’ve known better coming from this clown
Nobody:   YouTubers: "saying goodbye"  **Posts next week**
Lol
You should leave with him
As a man I don’t claim this guy
Ok bye
Click baiting loser. I was almost happy he was leaving, or she idek what it is
Cancer
20K+ salty as hell..... 😂 Jeff... you know you’re title is misleading. 😂😂😂😂😂
Plot twist: Chris is not leaving because he wants to "have a new chapter in his life" but he wants to be Kylie's videographer😂
Almost threw a party
I’ll be your personal assistant:)
before I clicked I thought he was leaving and I was happy.  turns out its a cameraman who doesn't want to stick by this shitty person anymore, I guess we have to take small wins.
When the #1 on Trending is about a cameraman:
The video quality is blinding me 😂
LETSSSS GOOOOO
Bye
How do I become Jeffree’s new assistant 😱
why is this on trending in my country.
No cap he look like a James Charles 😂
Thats kanye's new gf
Updated house tour please
Bet you $50 he is naked under that robe...
THE WAY I SAID BYE BITCH WHEN I READ THE TITLE, AND THEN REALISED THE CAMERA MAN IS LEAVING 💀
You did us wrong😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Good luck, hun! We love you. <3
You are boy or girl
Click bait much
How bitter are you all? 🤣 Literally have nothing better to do then hate.
Jeffree seems so sad. His eyes, his mannerisms. Its sad to see. He needs someone. I wish people wouldn't attack others.
can he leave youtube for real i cannot 😭
Only clicked because I thought he was saying good bye to YouTube and I'm here for that.. I feel so disappointed
U boy
Never come back. Thanks again.
Shartttty
No one CARRRES
UUUUGGGGGLLLLYYYY
Why tf is this recommended?  3 years later: people ask the same thing?
ugh I can't believe I fell for this clickbait
Naw but can u leave tho
This video is edited, so why did he include the unnecessary 30 secs in the beginning?
I was hoping you were saying goodbye :/
𝔽agg.
#bitcoin
Wow, his views are down. Still very high but much much much lower.  Why would his friend leave?  Maybe he didnr t pay him well enough?
Yay. So glad your gone
Man thats to bad I had my hopes up. Thought he was done
Wait but guys what if he is leaving it says he's not doing and more other videos 🥺😪
Damn thought he was leaving for excited. Someone’s views dropped. Lol click bait
so gay
His dogs name is Dessert? I wasted my life to find out that it’s not JS leaving but his damn camera man
not jeffree pretending to not know how to use a camera
Why am I watching this I have no idea who this is 💀
Thanks emily the girl who said he's not leaving its his camera  man
I love ur hair
Hoping he was leaving YouTube not gonna like. Thanks to everyone who confirmed what it really is so I don't have to have to give this snake ANY watch time.
First time im actually feeling the sincerity of  JS vlog. Its one of the only people who knew JS for who he really is. Good Luck Chris. Wish u the best in ur up comings.
Why are you so pretty
You're so disgusting
Yesssssss BYEEEEEE
Good
What the hell are we doing here?
All he , he ? Does is repeat its self over and over !! Wtf
Why do I feel like you are so chill in this video and almost more ''natural''?  I just like the way you're so laid back instead of posing perfectly like you would normally do in a reveal video, even the tone of your voice seems more natural and true. Glad to see that, Jeffree.
alright bye
Why has youtube recommend this poop to me ??? No thank you. Nothing like this in my life.
bye
You know I’m str8 but if this guy gave me 10k you never know man 😂
Wow he is getting vaccine soon.
Skeletor

CLICKBAIT
HE DEADASS DELETED MY COMMENT THAT SAID “IDGAF LEAVE” IM FUCKING SOBBING 😭😭😭
Great, another vloger  first on trending.
Less than 6 in seconds and all I'm thinking is silence of the lambs. Why was this recommended to me?
You should leave
Why so many ranches?  I don’t get it.
I was really looking foward to seeing that closet
Well I'm going to close the video,so I'm hoping you are leaving YouTube.
1 min in.. okay so after reading the comments I’m just here to dislike the video because he doesn’t actually say anything relevant, And it’s just clickbait cool .. bye
Danm I’m disappointed   Thought it was leaving
Kanye intensifies
I get it time to take a breather and relax for a bit but I hope to see you back on, I've always looked forward to seeing you on here. It's crazy so much has changed on youtube since I first started watching several years ago, so much drama now. Inreading the comments some people can be so mean, We don't know what's really going on, only what we hear I say if we weren't there than we don't know geez give the guy a break!
Why is this man always saying goodbye??
He looks dead in the eyes
Mashallah
What?
can't believe warped tour got canceled and this foo didn't
aw man i was really wanting her/him to quit
Your cameraman left then what?
I just saw you at a car show in your rolls Royce at the Lamborghini dealership
Is this a girl?

Sw
Anyone else got this randomly recommended??
Omg no intro 😞???
Thanks I'm blind now

con0great68 use that code it’s for a new app called bee network it’s all for free just you got to be in it just incase it goes big in the future it’s like Bitcoin just it’s free for now because their just starting up
Jeffery Star always looks like the comically flamboyant super villain
LMAOOO bye
you said channel and the dogs stopped and sat pretty lol😂😂
Awhh
Your followers are not worried for you Jeffrey. We know you Will come out of this tunnel like a pink Ferrari at full speed and in control. Please have your legal team help with the searching for new staff. Note: looks like your slouching, you don't slouch Jeffrey. You look beautiful and it's good to see you!
Good finally no more bullshit
Aight, ima start a war now.
Good, go away
So long fuck wit
WHY IS THERE 3 OF THEM

Never been so disappointed with youtube clickbait in my life    *i thought he was actually leaving*
Damn it I thought some of the cancer was getting off this website
Okay but I zoned out and was more interested in watching the dogs play. lol
Ok bye
Now that the Kardashians are over, use their camera crew....
Unforgiving🤔
I’m curious to see if he actually changes. If not, I’m over him
click bait on 100000000s hehehehehehehehehehe can't believe i watched this
Damn and I thought you were leaving....looks like I gotta cancel the celebration now-
2021??
Don't come back
Good
Click bait garbage as usual from the front page
I feel like we have a all pink palette coming
Sorry but I can’t take you seriously with those dogs lmao
Please leave for real
Let’s gooooooo

It’s just his camera man leaving
Kanya west come get you man
Darn it. I was expecting him to disappear from my feed forever.
I don’t care .-.
how are your eyeballs so white? and how do i get that?
So fake 🤥....I live for it😁
Finally
Please do the world a favor and go off the grid
I really don't like Jeffrey he should't have a career
🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮🤢🤮🏳‍🌈🏳‍🌈🏳‍🌈🤢🤢🤮🤮
Number E.
Thought he would speak the truth and say his contract with satan to become a vampire ran out
Jeffree: “sadly there’s no tea, there’s no gossip, there’s no drama” Me: 🚶
bro i was so excited 😔
I saw this on trending and I was like FINALLY, he’s leaving YouTube!!!
*wheeze*
HAHAHAHAHHAAH!!!!! For some reason you were in my recommended right after meat canyons video about you
I thought he was quitting youtube and i was about to be happy asf 😂
Jeffrey: Being serious Me: Watching the dogs fighting in the back
good riddance
Wtf why are the dogs so fat??!!???
He had enough
Love it 😍 you’ll find someone to help you out when you lest expect it 😘
Good
Working for Jeffrey seems like hard work but fun at the same time.
Batty man
this is him clickbaiting to try to stay relevant smh 🤦🏻‍♀️
Talk about kanya west
Good
Boyfriend Left, Dog Left, Camera Man Left, Personal Assistant Left, Friends Left.... Nobody likes Jeffree, and those close to him are eager to escape his cult!
Bruh this is like those fake found footage movies
and nothing of value was lost
Bye, Chris and Maddie, we'll miss you! I hope what comes next is awesome; we already know you'll rock whatever you do.
YouTube put him on trending because he is trans and safe to do so.
I get it. I know that Jeffree's life is different than most people. And that makes us want to jump down his throat  But...can we acknowledge that these are all huge changes, that would affect anybody (alongside 2020). I wish him all the best and growth through all this change.
Your being really extra dramatic. You should be more positive, the fame has got to your head girl get your shit together. Cant you be a bit more productive with all that money and not talk about an employee leaving and moving on in his career. At the very least How is this about you and why is that even important to all of us.
bye.
Had no other content to post??
Lmfao you are cringe
9/10 on the classic YouTube apology or tragic thing
Damn it, I thought you were leaving smh. I got real excited but no you mislead me. Wth man?? Honestly mood ig :I
Why is his whole team moving on with their lives?
🙁🙁🙁
Jeffree, you seem exhausted
Goodbye see ya. Good riddance
you spelled "everyone" wrong
Jeffree should be leaving, not the cameraman
I thought he was leaving YouTube. We've been scammed fellas.
Jesus really loves you, trust in Him.  John 3:16 (KJV)  For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. To enter the kingdom of heaven you must be born again. To be born again, repent and place your complete faith and trust on Jesus's sacrifice on the cross alone. Jesus is the only way. The narrow way to everlasting life. <3
is he gay?
I've been following you since your break up, my ❤️ felt so bad because nothing can fix 💔. My daughter recently lost the love of her life first & only boyfriend since high school. 11yrs he was killed by stray bullet. Mean while she's going thru her first heart break & 9 months pregnant due any day w/ there child. You know the first heart break is the hardest. Well she has it triple hard. She loves your make up. If you could find it in your heart to send her something even if it's just a business card. I just want to see her smile again. Also she's very good at make up & very beautiful we live in California, she's a hard worker she'll need a job soon.
Why do you look like that
Ight
What a way to get on top trending. Can’t wait to  see you post the same video about a year from now when people forget about this! Good luck!
Lmao I won't miss you
so dramatic 🥱
Like finnaly
Let’s go
This guy has become a zombie robot with no emotion from his fake personality
Dang, you really got my hopes up, didn’t you?
She/he is talking about her camara man leaving.. no need to say thank u
BYEEEEEE
If only it was real :/  Also i never leave hate but wow youre a really terrible person
🤢🤮
I can tell he's not leaving because I'm watching two freaking ads right now
Me: **slightly panicking**
🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡💩🧠
My first reaction was, "They clickbaited everyone so hard. Damn them, but damn us for clicking." My second reaction, "This camera man must be happy their friend made this."
Why's this on my recommended-😺
jebaited moment
The quality of this video is 1080p, yet looks like 16k lol
bye won’t miss you
احد يفهمني صاير
Dang I actually thought this problematic person was finally quitting YouTube
I knew it was click bate.
Also I love how many people came to leave hate comments yet they still gave JS views 😂 y’all are making this video trend and making him more money 😵😅
Noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!
Where's the application for personal assistant?
Dang.. I was hoping Jefree would quit YouTube..  Waiting for the day to come when he gets so canceled he deletes his channel. 😊
Enjoy your freedom ❣️
I feel like he is going to need to do a deep deep background check and social media check on whoever he finds as a potential new photographer. This person needs to not have a horrible intention on working with JS. Same with assistant. This is scary for JS. I hope he has these new people sign a NDA.
Just sooo tone deaf. “A lot of my major changes, 2020 has been so hard for me”. Her lost a videographer and a personal assistant. He’s talking about how hard things have been while he sits in this multi million dollar house, 3 dogs and expensive robe. Yeaaaa okayyy
I honestly don’t blame him about Covid changing his life last year and jafferee I hope everything works out for you and be strong btw I love pink to and I love ur hair
Why does Jeffree look like Big Ed in the thumbnail? No neck just head and shoulders
i don't remember asking
Finely
any askers?
Bye bye 👋👋👋
beauty bitch :3 wats the name of the tune in the background, love? :)
Why did I got this I don’t even know you I am not even subscribe! I just saw this on my recommend
Saying Goodbye.... To his videographer 🙄 k

Honey I know you're asthmatic and I want you to know that your asthma may get hella funky after getting the vaccine but it'll go back to normal in a few days. I'm disabled so I got the vaccine a few days ago and whew my asthma went to hell but its getting better. I just wanted you to know as a heads up!
Dear future 5 year self HEY SISTERS 😂
it’s gay, i don’t want it
Annoying clickbate...like Jefree has become.
wow your voice is deep!
*The camera quality is better than most of our eyes*
The background looks so poor in comparison to when you were relevant. Want a dollar for food?
Dam i was hoping he was quitting youtube
state off that ... looks like a jail house mess
Well to be honest its not like you upload anything good anymore. No more reviews, no more tutorials etc you are basically Jacklyn Hilling us...only coming on here to plug a launch
Wow
Tons of love
I recently moved to WY. ❤
you likedick in the zooty
Uhh this was reccomended to me.. Isnt this the guy who had a affair with kanye west or somethin?

Way to manipulate people into thinking you’re leaving.
Well it’s about damn time
Hi
Love you losing your fun.
damn guess i was to hopeful.
Ew tf is this
Andrew Siwicki is available
You look like you wash your hands after taking a shower
Goodbye
Bye, sister.

When he said “there have been a lot of ......... shifts”. I honestly though he was going to say sh*t especially with all the sh*t going on!!! 😂🤣😂
ONE WORD... CLICKBAIT!! Instead watch Angelika Oles or any Drama Channel for the scoop✌
Hi people 5 years later :]
Well this probably pretty early but you know you gotta keep doing what has made you, you, this coming from me.
Love the fcn bows fuuuuu. But ffs what clickbait this is.
Yr dam gay and you will always be gay
the only mildly interesting part of this video was the dogs fighting in the background
Lucky puppies ❤️
Yay you’re leaving
5/1 like ratio yikes
Best wishes to Chris. It’s so hard to not see family regularly. I haven’t seen mine in 12 years and COVID just sucks for everyone. I am loving that hair!  💜
This mom is just reminding you to take care of yourself and we will be here for you when you're ready. Good to see and hear you and the doggies. I wish your friends well with their New endeavors. You got this! 💝👍💝  hugs.
Sup future me who finds this in there future recommended

I don't watch Jeffrey Star. Do I need context to understand what's happening?
Jeffree doesn’t post for a long time Also jeffree:saying goodbye...🙄
Was wanting to see you gone from YouTube
You need to get some cats. Cats are very well behaved like the dog on your right side.  Was he raised in a two parent home?
Love ya pink hair

Good, next, leave as the “star” of the channel
Your so beautiful ❤️praying for you girl 😘💗
His camera is leaving YouTube. Don’t even waste your time with this video.

YouTube, how dare you recommend this to me?
Wishing Christian and Maddie the very best in their lives!💖
I DON'T CARE
Can you leave next? Like, forever preferably?
I can’t wait when this gets recommended to me again in 3 years
F*cking finally he was(WAS) "so pretty"(aka absolutely disgusting)
Pffft, I got excited for a minute.
Bye
Time to put your assistant to use!
Take care. I'm sure everything will be alright.
When JEFFREE SETS his own tripod up. Shits about to get real and I can relate.  That says a lot! I feel like this is really who he is now it’s not something fake.
I wish i could say you would be missed.
I was gonna say good riddance but then comments say it’s just the camera man dipping. Oh well.
come on, really? click bait title?  gees
Gurl bye, nothing but stunts!
BYE!!!!!!
Act your gender
Jeffree! Omg I know how devastating this is! But I know everything is going on will be good for a change and bigger things to come, I love u and I pray for you, you are not alone, stay positive stay strong, you got this!! Hope you read this message ...kisses and hugs from Puerto Rico 🙏🏻💋
was really looking forward to a REAL goodbye LOL
What the heck is wrong with YT, how did I go from looking up make up and mystery videos to JS saying good bye to his camera man?
3 years later when this gets recommended again  🧚‍♀️✨💃
thank god loser
He looks like a skeleton
Ew what is that
CLICKBAIT, YOUR WELCOME SAVED YOU  11:24 MINUTES OF YOUR LIFE!!!!!

Hi
Que susto achei que ele ia parar com o canal
You should try to visit st. Maarten
You came to title your video implying your goodbye only to tell us that your cameraman is leaving, what the heck
Jesus being this thing sure is stressful I think the cameraman was like “ight, I think I’ve seen the worst that came outta Area 51, time to head back to the normal life”
literally just leave
I Love You and I Miss You
Finally!
FINALLY
Love you jeffree you'll find some great people to work with you! All the best to chris and maddie!
CLICK BAIT
Okay but I miss Tati - but I’ve loved J star since warped tour
OMG.  What a clickbait. lol.
"hi poor people"
This dude really made it so dramatic girl bye☠️ later
ugh ew
No one gives Mr. Gay
The AUDACITY to CLICKBAIT
Who else is waiting for a Meat Canyon remake?
Okay but why unfollow maddie on IG then if there's no hard feelings? 🤔🤔🤔
#1 trending in UK for this
So glad i never watched 5yrs of this, sorry but sad... After less than 11:24 off this blayed  blab bla, absolutely nother here "diva"
Clickbait BS.  Typical.
Good riddance.
Amazing things coming your way!
I love how your dogs are all rowdy!
it also means that new things are coming (: love you Jeffrey I hope that I can join your fabulous team, one day.
i was so happy when i read the title. WHY ARE YOU CRUSHING MY DREAMS.
So
Ok
Me to myself: “Oh cool James blah blah blah...(Sees video) OOP-
shut up
Jeffree is kind person so if he is being mean yo you then you need to ask yourself
bye
Patrick star let himself go
Beam me back to the 80s
I wish you left tbh.....
I can't take my eyes of that dog. She is having the time of her life with that blanket.
FBI getting hot on your trail yet?
woah cute dogs
I'm not a fan of this dude but he's so DRAMATIC ok so you're camera man is leaving then just film yourself it's not that hard. He's so DRAMATIC chill dude 😐😐😐.
You can’t just get everyone’s hopes up like that and just not leave forever
I don’t like Jeffrey but his wig looks really nice
Good we won’t miss you.
Bro I thought man was leaving yt
not me clicking on this video then immediately clicking off so the watch time is bad lol
I’d move outta state and live with you just to film for you 🤣
استغفرالله شنو هذا
Anyone else find this kind of tone deaf? Like I know Jeffrey is going thru it but he is wealthy, white, he has a home and security and he bought his way to a vaccine and he’s just excited to travel again. I am 16 at home taking care of my mom during her cancer treatment because my dad is away caring for my dying grandma. I’m fucking glad Jeffrey can travel again. That’s awesome. I would do anything for a vaccine for my dad and I. I wish for NOTHING more than I wish for that safety. It is kind of time deaf to talk about the super duper hard time you’ve been having while super rich and privileged, there are so many people who can’t buy themselves a shot and get back to normal sitting on millions of dollars. People dying in the street and starving and so much and Jeffrey is just sitting here oblivious to the insane privilege he has
Finally

https://youtu.be/9k8VvdfM-sg

Hope he signed that NDA
Yay finally, my first and last video of yours

#AlphaBetas HEY HAVE YOU GUYS HERD ABOUT Alpha Betas GO WATCH IT NOW ON VANOSSGAMING CHANNEL IF GET ALOT OF PEOPLE WATCHING IT WE CAN GET A CONTRACT FOR A PLATFORM
https://youtu.be/qajjbwEkQOM
Damn so everyone quitting on Jeffree wondering why his channel is flopping lmaooo
Also really hoping this wild wig has something to do with a new palette with pinks lol. We are ready for a spring palette
Beanis
#FloppedEra
His views have gone way down
Funny how everyone is here 8)
Seems like everyone's been walking out of his life lately 🥱
1 YouTuber down, several more to go
Or eww grl or ae buy
Cool no one cares
Member. Member when you were best friends with that lost prophets dude.... remember. Remember what you use to tweet about... remember. What he went to jail for. Remember?
Are people leaving because their lives are changing direction? Or are they possibly leaving because of all of the drama attached to Jeffrey and his brand? Genuinely wondering.
i don’t even watch jeffree why am i here
We ain't so lucky didn't think so Bait
So dramatic
I accidentally clicked on this
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
Jeffree you ARE the drama in the beauty community

Who the hell are you and what the hell is going on
Dude it's a cameraman, you're acting like they're irreplaceable 💀
So sad one by one everybody is leaving you. You will end up like Michael Jackson alone in  a big mansion with your dogs.
Prays for Jeffree 🙏🏻🙏🏻
This is the most ironic video who thought he was leaving?
Click bait at its finest
Love your hair 😍
Your twin 😍
Good riddance!
The thumbnail looks like this emoji: 🗿    Btw this is my third time putting this comment thanks for noticing me jeff 🤙🏽
This person is 🤢🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
Goodness Jeffree’s really out here tryna break the whole internet with that title.
no you need to leave
https://youtu.be/qajjbwEkQOM
Its like YouTube took a crap on my feed!
Jeffree thank you, and thank you to your team including Christian, and Madilynn(sorry if I spelt that wrong) for all that you do. I discovered your channel during the pandemic at home from work with a back injury. I am also a healthcare worker who takes care of the elderly having lost many and even a coworker during this horrible time. Watching your channel all the way here in Canada brought some joy during so much darkness. You made me wanna wear makeup again after having to wear a mask for a year. I recently purchased my first JeffreeStar cosmetics and absolutely love your products. Girrrrl I read the title of the video and panicked that you were ending your channel. So happy you will still be here and thank you. Keep up the amazing products, the amazing and fun tutorials. Love you and all you do. Bitch you rock!!!!

Ok good
Whos here when this video is trending #1

What happened was a week ago someone in a car tryed to jump me for using the women’s bathroom to go sit down and go number 2   And someone followed me outside and said from a car animated that they were going to jump me and steel my purse again
I’m not a Jeffrey Starr fan but, shit is this the first video where a YouTuber is just putting their crew on display?? JS youse a real one, ya heard!
It's funny cause he made it 10 minutes just so he could get ads in
Thank goodness he is getting the vaccine

The BEAUTY community is the UGLIEST

(: I was just a little worried if you could tell the gay community I’m Anson thank you Jeffree ! Your amazing for checking on us and for gay rights I hope to have peace In San Jose ca for the women’s bathroom 🚽 maybe we need a gay lgbt 🏳️‍🌈 bathroom on story Rd San Jose ca 777 story rd Walmart San Jose ca  Please help equality for all is my mission in life .

The black dog is literally me , chilling and in my own world.
Enough with all the exasperated sighs. Gets old. Spit it out.
I won’t miss you
Nobody ever knew your assistant or your camera person. You literally just are bored and have nothing to post about like you said in the " *sadly theres no tea* "🥺 so sad for you.
Like, who or what is this?

He gets less beautiful when he tries harder.
Christian seems awesome, good luck with everything dude 🙏

Im goin to miss madi & chris but you always find your way which is what i love about you
It's cuz I really did make magic
and the purpose of this video is....?
Not me thinking he is quitting
I think I might be Qanon . You can check out my Instagram kitty_meow12
Bruh my mans looks like a demon 😂
It's cuz of me... I ❤️ -ed your Instagram. I bet the government is angry or feeling hopeful towards money for asking the right questions. It's cuz you questioned NASA and I'm a Jew. No offense. But slave owners exist
I got exited cause I thought he was leaving YouTube
I hope you find good people who are trust worthy to work with you ♥️♥️♥️
What is that???
This is the last time I will come to this channel because you know he loves good and BAD attention. Jeffery is so last year and overrated. Bye 👋🏻
I wish the best of luck and happiness to Chris and Madi-Lynn!! Thanks for being a part of the Star team and I hope you both are successful in your new careers!! 🌟❤🌟❤🌟❤🌟❤🌟❤🌟❤🌟❤🌟❤🌟❤🌟❤🌟
Good riddance! Finally wont have to see this shit in trending anymore.
So he’s not quitting youtube ?
You syck
ok
Bruh
Lets go
Saying good riddance.
This video is about the camera man. Nothing to do with jeffree
Yay
This is the bitchiest clickbait I’ve ever seen
As if you needed further proof of how full of shit this tool is, it's gotta use clickbat titles to get views.
I've never watched anything jefree star related and some how this was reccomended. Nice youtube
Damn i thought he was killing himself,fruity boi
I was about to celebrate the fact that children will be more safe without this dude. I was wrong he is still here....
BYE SISTER
Number 1 on trending
Take ur time Diva Queen 👸 ✨ 💖
Roses are red My name is Dave  This poem makes no sense Microwave
Saying goodbye to shane lol.
Jeffree: I'm not going anywhere
If this gets reccomended for 5 years hello!
Remember JESUS IS COMING BACK .. FOR IT IS WRITTEN : YOU ARE AN ABOMINATION U TO THE LORD .
I’m waiting for Jeffery star to leave YouTube .-.
‘’Hi I’ve never done this before’’ r u sure
Finally you leave
Diva I am soo sorry .. but you will bounce back .. but be very careful.. ilu JS 😍
Love you. Thank you for this damnit. Don't give a shit. That's what happens. You're right. Fuck all the haters
Jeffrey star: so you leaving me? Camera man: yes Jeffrey star: can you edit this video?
good for that christian dude for getting out alive lmao, as for jeff, pls seek psychological help immedietly  xx
Hi, 2025. folks is Covid-19 still a thing?
Turn to Jesus Christ, repent. Get right with God before its too late
We don’t care
Does he have asthma? Why is he always breathing like that? It’s the weird over acting for me.   Still respect his hustle though.
Vaccine...oh hurry!  Vaccinate yourself against something that has a survival rate of 99.97%+.  Now you can go without a mask...Not. Now you’re safe...not. Now you can go to crowded places...not.  Yeah, take the vaccine. Glad this wacko was recommended...entertainment.
Whoa
good riddance
Are u fr?
We won’t miss you
Why is this on my recommendation ??
Higher Andrew🤩
Girl, u will survive💃take care of u first & the rest will follow...love💜 ur furr🐾babies🐩 ✌😃👌
your a failure
This  person  has no idea what normal is, sadly. Put on your / my prayer list ( before it is everlasting too late).
I did think it was click bait at first. But to Jeffree it probably is a really big deal. That's a person who's been w him for a long time n made a major impact on him and his career. Not too mention he is a really good cameraman. I can understand having someone you're used to having in your daily life leave. Why is everyone acting like he is being dramatic,? This  is a person who is a huge part of his life. He is just a human like the rest of us. Idk.
Talk... eh he.. talk eh he
LMAO
Okbye. Close the door on your way out.
Everybody and their grandmother knows exactly what he was doing by titling this video like so. And he got exactly what he wanted, #1 trending! Clickbait is so trashy tho...
You are sad and lonely, but not forever 🥺😭💗💖 We love you so much. I support what you are doing to become a better person. You deserve every single cent you worked for. You are kind and always helping others, no matter who they are. You are in a path of growth and will continue to find fortune and love. This sadness and loneliness will be temporary Jeffree. Everything happens for a reason 💕💖😭💗💕💗 Keep shining, keep growing. We love you!! You are a star ⭐️ 💖💗💕
Girl, change is so hard. Sending you love and prayers and luck. You got this!!! 💜💜💜
Wtf is this crap
Barrow Andrew from Shane !
Press video, pauses and go straight to comments
Wow, thought it was something serious. Bye
Why does video of this kind always have the YouTuber handling the camera
Finally
he set the camera up on purpose to make it more “personal” so it can feel more real like wtf ewww
Stop laughing between each sentence
‘I’m so emotional right now’  jeffree’s facial expression: 😐
I love you jeffree
sick
dear 2026 me, i hope you are alive are you? or did the world end?? no??? that’s fuvkin lame. are you still lonely
lol
I applaud the clickbait, ya got me
The game
Jesus he has more tatoos than anyone i ever seen hes become more than human he is now ink man😂😂😂😂
boy wtf is wrong wit u
You look like Leatherface from Texas chainsaw massacre.
This the guy that was slurping Kanye’s meat ?
Bye
Thank god
Good grief...
"I hate goodbyes..." - Jim Carey in that dumb movie. 😆
W
Thank god
I don't know how in the f you people derive anything from this dude. 2 minutes of heavy breathing and then nonsense. This account just serves to let me know that US life issues a multitude of lotto tickets.
Oh, he’s not leaving YouTube? Fuck, I got so excited.
the quality 🎥 👁 👄 👁
You are soo prettyy!
Hi flop
Finally....
Thank god
Shut.up.
Pog
Freak!
Hello 2026 us and this is made in 2021! :)
Brh
Honestly wishing he *did* leave right now...
Cool but I don’t care
Never come back
Your hair btw is gorgeous!!💗
Bye bye whatever you are. I think you may be identifing as an idiot.
cya in 6 years when this gets recommended
ok bye lol
You are an embarrassment  to me and to all who stand up for the truth.  A charlatan and an instigator.
Clickbaiter :/
LATER LOSER
I thought diva died or his mom 😭
You should’ve just disappeared bruh
90% of the video: w f h o o
Let me guess, there's a major controversy that's about to come up soon. Isn't that right?
Jeffree: we need to have a deep talk  Dogs: time to start a war back here  Edit: THIS BLEW UP IN 3 HOURS HUH-
Yay Bye
Do not get the vaccine
💚💙💜
why did youtube recommend this, have no interest in this at all . . . big fail youtube
5 years later : Saying goodbye.. (on our recommendation)
Omg bby I would love to film your life WTF
I was terrified throughout this entire video that his “wenis” (Jenna Marbles’ word!) would make an appearance.... Looks like The Lonely Doll keeps losing acquaintances...
RIDICULO
Only reason I’m watching this is because it’s on trending 😂
Thank God, this type of content should be banned from youtube.
Bye bye
Click bait and a waste of time, YouTube needs to stop recommending this to me
I’d love top see what’s redone/redecorated in your new house.  Did you finish the vault?
Good Riddance
Yes yes lord is real I hate him ok well that’s cool time go u go o watch other stuff
Hello
foh😒 u freak
Why is this in my recommended, I don’t even watch content like this, it’s been literal months since I’ve watched a video that even mentions this dudes existence
Sooo can I have your house?
how many apology video sighs are in this
I'm tired of calling this a recession, this is a depression over 30 million unemployed, this isn't a recession. I think the pandemic has taught people the importance of multiple streams of income unfortunately having a job doesn't mean security
Ok, I don’t care, I don’t really know if anyone will actually miss you, lol!
You are manipulative and dishonest.
Jeffrees house is going to be even more lonely. Karma is real
Ok bye
This ghoul..
Why did YouTube recommend this to me....I wanted to watch a monke flip not this
*Yawn* 😒
Goof
i see a lot of people calling jeffree a “she”, does he use both pronouns?
Thank you for the video! I was scared you are leaving youtube. That would of been sad ... you are very nice and glam. Hope to see your beautiful nails soon :D You look glam with nails!
Hi u gay transgender person
Me watching this video thinking another one of his dogs died: 👁️👄👁️
Interesting 🧐
😭😭

Hate it
Zero life zero family hire me
we won’t miss you lol
Bye finally
Ugh i really thought he was quitting youtube :/
one weird person less on YouTube and of course on my suggestion list
Everybody should dislike the video.
Im sorry about maddie and chris, and they will be deeply missed. But I am wishing them both the best, and cant wait to hear or see them again. Also Jeffree you keep being amazing!!!
Didn't ask
Comments are still on? Bold move by tinkerbell over here.
Who cares
DNC DO NOT CARE
YO, GOODBYE SISTERS ALL OVER AGAIN. Omg, I can't wait for the next apology
He’s not popular anymore
Freak
Lol no one cares
Kanye is gonna have a good time now that he and kim getting separated
I hope your return trip to your home planet goes well...
Sad. Chris and Mattie we will miss you!!! Take care of you.
I’m in tune, but can’t help but watch the adorable dogs. Things will always work out for the best!
Can’t wait for this to be your best year yet!

I thought this piece of trash was finally leaving YouTube. BUT NOPE. 🙄 Just another clickbait video to get attention
The dogs are algels😇🥰😘
ooooo you’re messing with the wrong one
Since Shane Dawson is not making videos anymore, why don’t you hire Andrew?????

*minecraft skeleton sound*
this seems intentionally shitty video quality?
Sorry y’all i clicked cuz he reminded me of a poodle🤡
cameraman: gone personal assistant: gone how about your hair guy?
lol why am I recommended this? I don't even watch Inkmasters. Guy? Girl? tf
Good riddance
he’s not even leaving, im mad
Who this
Comment your year below:
Rosé’s solo was taken off from number 1 trending for this vid, sad.
Love you Jeffree ❤️❤️❤️❤️ I’m so proud of you and you help me live, I miss you though
Thank God, it's about time
When the #1 on Trending is about a cameraman:
Pov. This was posted 1 day ago and is #1 on trending
o he turned the camera on himself wow life changing....
Bye, no one cares.
I mean Chris sounds like he was held hostage bored and abused in every video soooo....overdue.
Even though there’s no tea people will start brewing some.
Alright... bye.
Wait, that creature is male?
I-
Ew anyways here’s the recipe for brownies: 1/2 cup butter 2 eggs 1 cup sugar 1/3 cup cocoa powder 2 teaspoon vanilla extract 1/2 cup flour :)
Well I’ll video tape you fosho
It's trending number one because of the clickbait title 🙄🌚
Today’s even better
*finally.*
A hot mess of NOPE
Who the hell is this person??

What’s up with all the deep breaths? Boy, please! 🙄
Please leave and stop being a disease to the social media. Your toxicity with people close to you and your backstabbing defined you.   I applaud you and compliment you for being a genuine hypocrite.
See you later brop!
That camera is crispier than my own vision
What did I just fucking watch.
This is number 1 on trending!!! “The Elf Cosmetics Delicious!” I love it!!😬
Nobody cares if your gone dramqueen
lmao everyone leaving his ass
Just watching cause on trending
the wig hunnyyyy✨✨
THANK GOD HE IS LEAVING
Leah Ashe is that you?
Seriously what the hell. Like this is pretty irrelevant to almost all of your audience. This is straight up clickbait and it got 2.2M VIEWS. Seems like you dont give a fuck about your viewers, it sounded like someone died at first, seem like that was on purpose. I dont know what it is for the money, just being conceited? Or do you think you have to share every little thing with everyone? Idk comes off very fake and for the hell of it.
Nobody cares and good riddance
I hope you find the right person for you ✈️
tf is trending nowadays
Good.
Saying goodbye to Kanye’s balls
Good
What abt saying goodbye to “hair by jay” huh?
This is so dramatic 😂
DUECES AIN’T GONNA MISS YA :)
Finally
Who’s Chris?
The thumbnail be like 🗿
Bye b etch
Anyone else mute and scroll to the comments section??
Jeffreestar? More like jeffree-tard am I right fellas?
You male. Or famale?
I am sending you some positive vibes your way! You're amazing Jeffree star ⭐💫✨
1
Based on the title I was really hoping you were saying goodbye to youtube for good. Dreams must stay dreams I guess.
How can people even watch this clown lmao, I was hoping he was leaving
“Never done this before” *flashback to shitty apology video on Gucci  couch*
the beginning of this video with the camera adjustments is the best bit of this video
no one cares just leave
Too bad so sad. Not. Dont let the door hit you on the way out. Freak.
He did the huff he did the dogs he did the luxurious background he did the "humble" clothes man did everything
lol
ew
Dude people have lives   Let them not work for someone else and let them have their own dreams and goals   They probably got tired of working for a confirmed sexual predator
Gay people am I right
ew
Him trying to make him feel bad so he can bring him back
Star looks worried that his former assistant and former camera man will talk. He had them sign NDA’s but there is nothing to stop them from telling people Stars secrets now.
Couldn’t you have cut the putting the camera on the tripod bit
_italic_ -strikethrough- *black*
Who am I to judge. Let God have mercy on this lost soul
Gross
Bye idc
Real story is his assistant and camera man would not put up with his toxic bullshit abuse anymore. Just look at his assistants tweet after leaving.
Get out of satan system and get in God system before its to late ⏳
Trash content from a trash person
This isn’t the goodbye I was expecting 🙄
That dog just laid his head back and got face sat by the other dog lol
Bruh half the comments are saying good riddance- 💀           But yeah he’s getting desperate for views now since people are realising he’s the human embodiment of a wet sock
Wtf is this? Why would YT even recommend this to me?
Fuck why is he still here I hate gay ppl
bye
Fuck I thought he was quitting and I was fixing to be so happy
I don't care
I don’t wanna watch it, can someone give me a TL;DR?
Oh no, anyway...
I thought he was quitting YouTube
Ok bye
Bye
Oh no...
Why the fuck am I watching this
cringe
No one  cares good luck
Finally
Why is this in my recommended?
Why he heavy breathing
Just letting yall know it’s clickbait, you can click off now, don’t give him the watch time
HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHAHAHAH BRO FUCKIN MEAT CANYON PREDICTED THIS SHIIII HAAAAAAAAAAAAAHAHAHAHAHA
Bye Felicia
The camera quality is better then my eye sight LOL
But the hair is EVERYTHING
Great respect for you Jeffree, you worked your way up to your dream. Yeah there's a lot of not very nice people out there in our world. But we always have the unconditional love of our pets 🐈 🐕   If we could only be like them. Be well everyone and walk away from the drama, life will be so much more sweeter
Him: 2020 was a crazy year, there have been a lot of illnesses You do not have permission to say that when you were taking photos with your fans not wearing a mask. The audacity to cry about something that you contribute to
Chile you scared me
Fall in?? Do they allow hot air balloons to crash land in hidden hills?? I just moved to California so im still figuring things out.
He is disgusting. Why tf was this is my recommendations?
jeffree some vide exposed you secret about you past go watch the video
These comments 💀
lol
“Sadly there’s no tea”  *clicks off video                 Jk 🙂
Bye Alien
I thought he was leaving youtube,  God am I disappointed
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOO

Nice clickbait ...Real Nice
Bro start apologizing man
Ok bye
I know a guy who is a great camera guy
When men try to be women
No one cares
Go away PLEASE!
Wish you better for your future and be happy always 🌸🌸
Jeffrey is so irrelevant change my mind
YES BYEEEE
italiani che traducono?
She looks like she was dropped on a pole when she was little  Oh god it’s a guy. Wtf
😭😢☹️🙁😕😟😔😩😫😖😣😓😥😨😥😰😱😿🥶🤕
i thought he was leaving youtube or chris died lol
I never understood how "Beauty" means making yourself look like a fucking alien.
How dare this be above on the ground on trending
i have no family, no life, and a killer resume..... HI, HOW ARE YA? :)
I’d be jeffrees personal assistant anyday
Y’all he’s not quitting, just another dumb video. Don’t waste ur timen
See you all when this randomly gets recommended to us 5 years later 👋🏼
Peace out
PCE won't be missed
clickbait master
Wait he still has a platform? Shit man ig
Jesus Christ is our lord and savior! Repent for your sins! God loves you unconditionally! John 3:16 repent!
WAIT, I know you... your from meat cannon
Sounds to me like when a company is closing but denying it but keep laying off people. I think he is moving on to something different where he can not be called on his BS
Is that hair by jay? Lmaoooo
This 'person' has serious problems and desperately needs help.
I thought he was finally saying goodbye to YouTube 😩
Just another example of someone taking themselves WAY too seriously.
I just finished watching a gorilla jumping off a short tree, sure, I laughed. But then I went back to my homepage and saw this, I laughed so much harder
wait, this is number one on trending?
My eyes are dying,  this image is too fucking clear
Gross
bye
Okay bye
i rlly wish this wasn’t clickbait, almost got my hopes up :(
I was like YES JEFFREE IS LEAVING YOUTUBE when I saw the video but then he said his camera man is leaving
Can I have that hair it’s sooo cute and your dogs are cute too
Damn I knew it was too good to be true
Funny how he won't acknowledge he's apart of the drama on YouTube.
Good luck Jeffree!
Papyrus put on make up
The worst youtuber on the planet is going bye-bye thank God
thirsty for views
Go hide and chill out in Biden's oval office, maybe he'll sniff your hair.
Byeee
There’s so much changes in your life I know your cameraman is gone it must be so hard they’re working you to the bone aren’t they 🙄🙄🙄
WHY IS HE SOO GAY
I really thought he was gone for good :( i used to be a fan, but as i grew up, i noticed alot of things, and realized things too. It was fun while it lasted. 2 years since i decided to stop stanning. The toxicity and fake news n such, i really thought he was leaving for good. (I dont hate him. I dont feel anything towards this person anymore.)
No one cares
Girl, I quit my 7 year job yesterday to start a new chapter in my life. I can relate to missing people you’ve been around for so long, every single day and then leaving them. 😭😭😭
Another video of one massive Afghan Hound on a couch with 4 other dogs
Disliked. Your welcome.
Isn't he pretty...pretty fuggly.
Sad to see Chris go. Hope for the future
Wake up grace we need you❤️
Take a break from YouTube
Eeeeeeew
i wish YouTube make a not interested button just like tiktok.
I live in Casper, we eat at the same restaurants,  we got our personalized plates days apart, he shoots at the same club I'm a member of, wouldn't it be cool just to run into him at the truck stop?
Good be gone freak!!!

Hi Jeffrey I love your hair!
Jeffree I will help you with everything. I know you must be going through
Wtf is this
The Bride of Frakenstein...with pink hair.

You guys, the pandemic has been so hard on poor Jeffree. Send positive vibes to Jeffree in his palatial mansion
Good clickbait you got there
I get that people change and move on, but to be perfectly honest, Jeffree, you need to look within yourself to see why this constantly happens to you.
Didn’t ask
Why is this trending
You’re going be ok 😘you have your babies they know who has good intentions they never going to left someone with bad intentionsbe close to you baby ok 👍🏻
I was hoping you’d b leaving YouTube
Love the robe baby
WTFE 🎬
Ok
WTF!
Idk why anyone gives these celebrities any attention, I don’t understand. They’ll die just as anyone else will.
So basically everyone around him is leaving because nobody can stand him anymore.
See ya you freakshow
Yay!
Why does anybody watch this guy like I’ve never even thought about him until seeing this video lol
Speak up people... this isn't right.
When you're so insecure about views you have to use click bait.
How can you sit there and say i can't wait to travel again when that's all you have been doing throughout lockdown you are a joke
Roses are red violets are blue your all gonna hate me but this guys a dude
Goodbye
:'( chris is moving on im happy for him and sad as well

Goodby  Ga y Lo rd
I hope he’s leaving for real annoying ass

Someone is reading this comment while taking a shit 💩

Disgusting
Order is just the order of the rich! It's not our order! Because politicians' corruption has already broken the rules and broken the order! They have not been punished! We don't need to abide by this unfair order!
eww
This video is hysterical.
That is very sad especially seeing 2 great friends move on with their lives but the thing is yall are still friends and will still be able to see eachother so that makes things better!! I wish the best for them and you Jeffree and hope you can find people good enough to feel them spots!! All my Love Sweetheart 🖤🌺🖤

shameless clickbait...he knows very well why we clicked on this video!
I was honestly surprised Chris did not leave after JS and Nathan broke up. I remember him and Nathan being close friends. No hate. Just honestly surprised.
i’m disappointed i thought he was leaving 😪
Bye
He could've said all this in 30 secs and tbt,WHY did he even need to make this? Would anyone notice that Chris was gone?Im sure Shane is available as a replacement 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
👋

Bye babe wont miss you 🧍🏼‍♀️
Didnt watch the video but 👋 to whatever this is about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLKnKwYkgZs
When your camera is more likeable and less plasticky and fake than you are
He looks so dead behind those eyes.
What happened with your assistant? Tell us the tea on that Jeffree!!!
Jeffree’s views are down so clickbait is his last option 🤦‍♀️
Omg how much dogs and how much tattos
why tho ?
11:23 is what you came for
Well, I was in love with Chris, so this sucks for me too :D.
How do i block a channel so it doesnt come up in my explore feed?
Just realized there's no not interested in trending ( unfortunately)

Omg that black hole between his legs gave me so much anxiety!
Ex
Emoji will take over
I never met such hypocrisy in my life
he's saying goodbye to his camera man chris and madi.
It is crazy the amount of people that really take the time out of their day and energy to watch the whole video right and then sit there and talk whatever how they wish she left or whatever why would you spend your time and energy watching somebody you hate not only that but you watch the whole s***
Yessir
What is wrong with  your white dog's eyes? Is she/he being treated?
He takes so long to get to the fucking point. What a pointless video
Don't let the door hit ya where u wish the good lord split ya...
Who cares?

First and only video I've seen! Bye!!!
Am I the only person that thinks Meat Canyon drew this dude exactly to spec?
When a 12 minute video could have been a 2 sentence tweet 🙄
Am I the only one who would love to be his personal assistant?
all the best to them 🌸 .. please don't say goodbye to this channel. 😉
Btw guys, this is clickbait.
Don't let the door hit you on the way out
Why do the dogs sound like bees at the beginning. Am I high?

Yaya
Promise🥺?
jeffree have got to collab with ELF
Everyone else feels some kind of *Krusty'* s vibes? Only me?
The dogs were entertaining, sorry..
to think that i got my hopes up
Oh god, how hard it must be for you :(  Losing both the camera man and your assistant. The years of hard work and all that trust. And now you have try to find new ones. I feel your pain <3  Without my own shining star I would not have the energy to get out of bed in the morning. I literally can't functioning without my assistant, she helps me with everything. And if she would one day quite, god forbid, it would be hell to find a new one because I would compare everyone new to her.   Hope you find two new people soon and I hope that both Chris and Maddie have fun in there new life, all luck to them and to you!
take your video yourself

Best of luck and wishes to Chris and Maddie! You'll have that energy back into your life soon Jeffree!
The whole world is set up to show Consequences for doing wrong.  All have lied and stolen and looked with lust. All have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God.  The wages of sin is death but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus Jesus our Lord.  We must be willing to turn from sin and to believe the Gospel Mark 1:15 to receive Jesus forgiveness !!!  Offering  HOPE  🙏 in eternity ♥️🤍💙 Salvation is found in no one else, no other name under heaven given among men where by we must be saved.  Saved from the punishment of sin.  I’m trying to offer people Hope in absolute perfection !!!  No more pain, dying, lies, decay, depression, anxiety, crying, sickness, rotten food, broken things , etc... offering the Hope of Eternity in heaven with Jesus Christ.  We must be willing to turn from sin and to believe the Gospel Mark 1:15 to receive Jesus forgiveness.  He who does the will of God abides for eternity 1 John 2:17 Visual Bible movies on YouTube. Matthew, Acts, Luke, John ♥️🇺🇸🤍🇺🇸💙🇺🇸 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Why was my first thought to hire Andrew.  He’s not filming for Shane anymore, knows jeffree and has the skills.  Plus we’d get to hear that glorious laugh behind the camera again.
Ho’Oponopono
FINALLY BYE
Lmao and this is #1 on trending 🙄 #biggestclickbait
Us he a boy or girl

Love you Jeffree
I was really hoping for youtube to have one less toxic youtuber
It will be alright Jeffrey , hope you find the right person to work for you. Looking forward for new vids.🤗
This video is literally everything people mock about you tubers
Chris and Maddie are deeply loved by the Star Fam! Wishing them both the best ❣️
Can people pls stop hating him ,he is a billionaire he could get a new camera man if he snaps a finger yet he is so sad for his cameraman leaving ,and he has no friends and that is y lives in that big fucking mansion alone with ten dogs ,he trusts no one cus he is hurt ,i really understand y u all hate him but he was really hurt he started his life as nothing ,we all should be proud how a man who dress up like women got slamed by people is a billionaire (HIS TATTOO 'S  THAT U SEE ARE SCARS THAT HE COVERD SO THAT NO ONE WOULD UNDERSTAND HIS PAIN ) he has been through so much just cus he cant play victim and promotes himself people judge him guess what we no one is perfect !

Jeffree, you are amazing and I love you. I know that there is a lot of negative stuff here but, you do you.  Haters going to hate.
Jeferee star says ni...
HE ISNT QUITTING YOUTUBE ITS JUST CLICKBAIT
Caca
Wow, I'm disappointed I thought he was leaving YouTube.
This is such clickbait
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Cancel David
BOOOOOO
For goodness sake i got this in my recommendations idc YouTube  Sorry if I offended anybody not intentional.
PLEASE PROMISE US
Yes please leave
I only liked this video because I thought he was saying Good-Bye to YT.. DISLIKE.
Disclaimer: He's not quitting youtube smh
pewdiepie.. im deleting my channel...! pewdiepie: (few min later) hey guys! fist pump!
Love you, Jeffrey! I’m glad you cleared everything up before the drama channels started speculating! You are awesome and it’s hard to lose employees you love and trust, but they will just move into the “friend sphere” of your life and that’s okay! 😘
The dogs in this video are funny asf
“I’m ready to travel again.” .... has been traveling the whole pandemic 🤨
Freak of nature....
Jeffree: goodbye.. Us: u promise????
Jeffree: goodbye.. Us: u promise????
Yes finally
So, like every other person when they say this, they'll be back in a week
The clarity and quality of the camera is way better than my life.
ok
im sorry jeffree i know thats hard my best friend is moving very far away and ive cried like 25/7
This guy is a friggin fruit-cake.
forgive your mother and return to your father
Bruh I thought he was quitting YouTube
K goodbye, don't care
How the hell is this #1 On Trending?
Us: Someone died? Nope JS: my video camera man just left me Us: bitch please!!!! Leave the damn YouTube 😈
he's not quitting Youtube... you're welcome.
Bye.
So dramatic lol. Hire me as your dogs caretaker :)
Another level💢
https://youtu.be/ohvNo9Lsvm8
Girl bye how about you leave
I cba to watched is there a tl;dr?
Peter Mon PREDICTED THIS VIDEO!
I’m confused I’m came back to your channel and nobody likes you- what did he do this time
glad you’re gone
Oh no. Anyway
bye no one wants you anyways <3
We don’t care😐
Girrrrrl. The path to enlightenment is letting go of explaining yourself. (Still lit to see you againnnnnn!) Some people are here for a lovely season, and that’s life. You be good to YOU, and when we see you coming in hot, I sure as f* wont call it a comeback. Slayyyyy
lol
The black dog is so cute and still, I almost think that it is a stuffed animal.
PUH LEAZEEE don't come back we're begging like deadass ❤️
Damn he knew everybody was hoping he would be getting off YouTube hence the clickbait
I thought this was going to be about a dog padding away or something. He is the queen of catching views, knows to keep the suspense going long enough to keep people from clicking away before the view time qualifies for that ad cent. It's kinda funny to watch youtubers grasping for their next paycheck. This video is SOOOO unnecessary, I'm not exactly a fan, but I do watch a lot of the videos & I didn't know who his camera guy was. But hey, he has some news that can easily be spun into click bait, hasn't been posting as much & he can give a reason for posting less. AND he can collect a check that will cover a mortgage.  This is prob also him trying to beat the media to the punch if anything has been going wrong. 2 long time employees leaving is going to lead to rumors even if nothing has gone sour.
LEAVE
@ihatelife
No one cares 😝
#1 ON TREDING
"there's no drama" really ??
Unbelievable how many ignorant comments are here... ive never really read comment on Jeffree's videos and now I'm disgusted that I chose to browse through them. People make me sick... I wish the best to Christian and Maddy on the next chapter of their lives and you will both be missed dearly! Jeffree, stay strong (I know there is no need tobsay this) and know you do have true supporters even through you crappy times. Sometimes being a public figure people forget youre only human. If I had the funds to relocate my family I would love to try to fill Maddy's shoes but thats will remain 1 of thousands of dreams unfulfilled for me. I hope you find trustworthy, faithful, and amazing people to fill you life! Also, hugs and kisses to your furbabies!
you don't need to watch the whole thing, he's not leaving, he's here forever.
i forgot u existed
0:41 not you apparently 🙄
I wish you the best💙🕉️💚💜
lesss goo
Bye
Bye
No ones cares.
Bye 🖐🏾
I literally started clapping at the end
We won’t miss you
Woohoo... vacuous and forgetful.
I'm here for the comments.🤣🤣
Damnit, I thought he was leaving YouTube.  I wish I could take back my click for this video.
I was watching the dogs the whole time
I'M WILLING 1000000% TO BE YOUR PERSONAL ASSISTANT, CAMERA MAN, MAID, FRIEND, ENEMY, DOG, ETC. HAHAHAHAHAHAHA. I love you 💕 Stay safe Queen ❤️
Well man wanted you to say goodbye to this platform. Maybe another day
Ur hair 😍
Ight bruh peace
Saya tidak begitu memahami apa yang diaampaikan...yang jelas aku cinta amerika
Please tell me it’s a permanent “goodbye “
This makes me wanna go back and watch the first tutorials with Chris. Thank you for your service Chris,  wish you the best moving forward ❤🌹
I'm nigg@
Who needs Netflix when this guy is already a drama queen 👑
I couldn't concentrate on anything he was saying.  I was too busy watching the dogs.
Next Week: “I’m Back!!!”
This is Male or Female ?!
I'm taking a break... Until I need more money
Anyways
Think I might hate you
K
The pandemic is over a year old now
My sis * omg noooooo me * what I know bruh......
He isn't quitting YouTube? Oof. I was hoping something good would happen this year
Oh that caption..ohh that description box-  I got my Cinnabon Delights ready!! 🤣 Just be you- like you’ve been, hopefully ‘the world’  will never push you to ‘say goodbye’ or take a ‘break’, it’s great to have escapes & take a breather.  It would have to be wayyy longer than a-almost 12min video! Thank u Jeffree, for all you keep doing and cheers Chris!
Click bait
1000% you’re not because for some reason every YouTuber needs to pretend they have drama.
Thank God.
Cool I never watched any videos or subscribe just came to say    🚪🏃🏾
Not to he rude but who are you
I've been waiting for this moment my entire life thank god you are being abolished omg
Ew
Love you Jeffree❤ Will always watch and support you
All this time I’ve saw you on your Snapchat story and never once did I saw a YouTube video from you except this. Love you Snaps tho!
Click bait 😏
THANK.THE.LORD.
This is the #1 trending ? What a joke
Omg i thought he was gonna say he died! Dont do that to me😂
ABC’s of SALVATION  ADMIT: You’re a sinner, condemned to DEATH (physical & spiritual) .  Romans 3:10, 23 There is none righteous, no, not one … For all have sinned and come short of the glory of God.  Romans 6:23 & James 1:15 the wages of sin is death … sin, when it is finished bringeth forth death. (Spiritual death is eternity in HELL !)  BELIEVE: that JESUS died, rose again, and that HE ALONE can save you from sin, death, and hell.  Romans 10:9-10 if you: believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness.  CONFESS: JESUS CHRIST, and nothing else, as your own Saviour. Romans 10:9, 10 & 13 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus … confession is made unto salvation … whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.  Before it’s too late, forever, DO IT NOW! God’s gift is FREE and as easy as A-B-C !

What the hell
Bye Felicia.
Such amazing person as you will find a way to fill those shoes! And I believe it’s gonna be just as amazing experience! Life always finds its way!❤️
It must be super tight
And here I thought the most toxic Youtuber ever would do us the favor and leave the platform. What a shame... Oh well maybe next time 🙄
*”Just came here to say I don’t care about whatever jeffry is quitting.”*
You might be an a** and I might not like you, but I am sorry for not believing you and Tati about James C.
"why I turned the camera on myself..."   He's so goddamn rich.
Good riddance
I love this video because of the Pomeranians alone. So fun watching them play in the sunshine and babies just chillin on your right. Sorry about Chris...I hope you find someone you trust and is trustworthy!
damn I didn’t watch the video all the way through. 😐
Jesus Christ is coming back   Isaiah 55:6-7 Seek ye the Lord while he may be found, call ye upon him while he is near: Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.
Oh thank god PLEASE!
Hopefully it’s for good
Awwwww :( dangit I thought he was quitting youtubeeeeeee 😔
fucking finally.
You're indisputably a male. I know by your bone structure so stop pretending to be a woman
انعن طحطح هذا محسوب عليمن عنده انوثه اكثر مني يمه يلعن كصتي
why is this video for... jesus
Good riddance.
Click bait and got me.  No clue who you are.
Nobody’s gonna talk abt how everyone was talking abt him vouging in his apology video thumbnail and this videos thumbnail was kind of awkward?🤔 Jeffreys tryna pull some shit
"Nothing, nothing but friendship can last forever." Now I understand what this saying means.. well I cried a bit
Good
YOU GO  GIRL !!!LOVE YOU !!!
Saying goodbye to your camera man ? 😑
GIVE KSI HIS #1 SPOT BACK
Dislike ✔️💯 Bye.....
The universe confuses me
Shane's out of work, can't he film & edit for you? 🤔
I love you Jeffrey hope everything goes well!!:)
full offense why does jeffrey get the vaccine before me
I wish this was true
I give it a week..
Good riddance
Are they a he or her. I cannot tell which. Pls help.
im not watching this is he quitting or no
damn and i came here to celebrate thinking you were gonna quit yt 😔
All these people wishing he would quit YouTube and came here purely to comment about it... I dont get it. If you dislike someone just, yknow, ignore their existence? Why bother leaving pointless comments, your just giving him views and shit lmao
Good, go.
Never come back hisoka
I thought he meant something else.
So it’s a guy trying to be a girl?🤨
Nobody gives a shit, Jeff.
I wish it was jeffree leaving the internet instead. also long story short, this isn't hom saying bye. he us saying bye to his camera man
Pancake make up
I usually hate to hear when people are getting the Vaccine. As I know its the mark of the beast. I certainly think it was made for you Jeff Star. Why dont you just get two and make your maker really happy.
Predator
Hot mess
Hot mess
Is The United States Busy Watching Jeffreestar Youtube Channel, It's on No.1 Trending
Ok? Go 🤣
OMG his life is so rough! I can't imagine have to go between mansions and have to find a new assistant. Please pray for him so that his life will be easier!!!!!!!! (eyeroll)
Pls just stay offline, Mr worst person ever
WELL WE DID IT BOYS
Diew
Ok bye!
Will you come back 🥺
damn he really got us with the title
I wanna see a Jaclyn Hill liquid lipstick review
Jeffree: Saying Goodbye...  Everyone : About time
Finally you shut up
Spoiler: he’s not quitting YouTube Lmaoo
I just love this person so freaking much. More will be revealed......I can't wait
Yep, I'm a troll because men like you deserve trolling and I have no qualms about calling a spade a spade.  CAPICHE ?
I came for tea. I stayed for puppies 😍
Please and thank you
Please leave the fucking internet
Yep, it's "D", all of the above.  When people start leaving you life then you can bet it is not because they just decided to do something different it is because you started treating them different.  Most people in this day and age WANT TO KEEP THEIR JOBS so telling us that they just had a change of heart falls flat, because during this VOVID lockdown no one is stupid enough to just walk away from a good paying job, or is it that you don't pay them shit and they DO need other gainful employment, so they can actually have a life instead of being yelled at by a queen.  If you are as much a bitch as you are a queen, I can understand why they all would want to leave.  You ain't the first to have this happen and you won't be the last.  YouTube gives people expectations and impression that they can continue to do this even when they're 45.  You do need to do something different my friend because of who you are and all that Tats you have, you have narrowed down you choices of who would find you sexually attractive at 45.  Ha ha ha hahahaha I have no sympathy for you, because you laid your own bed, now you'll have to sleep in it.
#1 on trending wow
*Claim your "I almost had a nervous breakdown" ticket here.*
I’m beyond disappointed, just leave and don’t come back pls
Wait is that a promise? I really hope so
i almost gave a fuck
Was kinda excited but blah its just clickbait
Love you jefree!! 😍 I know you'll find the right person to keep your channel thriving ❤ wish it was me 😅
His cameraman is quitting and he can’t find anybody else to work for him, in case anybody wants to save five minutes of their life skipping into that
Please don't go! You're a light in my darkness! Losing my Dad this last June also my job I loved in Macy's cosmetics and fragrances! Oh Chris is leaving. You scared me.  You are still a light in this sad world. My kiddo is all I have to keep me going.  Love you! 💗 Goodluck Maddie! Dream job!💗
For all those who wish he could leave YT or be gone. You aren’t a better person! If you can’t stand him, don’t want to support him, don’t care like you all state, then why are you still keeping up? Aren’t you all done with him for all the mean, horrible things he said and did? Didn’t you all claim him to be canceled? I just don’t understand! He can Keep his channel for whoever cares about him and his brand. Don’t you see you all are hiving him views and putting him on #1 trending? Just leave! let us we all bad b***es, broken souls, horrible persons, stands, what ever names you want to call us to enjoy his content. Some of us like this man. Some of us like his makeup, some Of us like the dogs. some of us are stands. I know, I get it! we are all entitled our voice and opinions, just don’t want yours to be above anyone’s or become a decrete! Please Stop promoting the bullying you all hate him for. Don’t try to change him, change yourselves. Thank you.
I really hope u leave
I wish I lived in LA hope things get better :)
Nobody cares

I love the progression of Maddie and Chris just wanting to do what's best for them uts so inspiring! I'm sure whoever fills their spots (as much as I want it to be me) will be great as well.
GOOD RIDDANCE LMAOOOO!!!!!!  (this is a joke but srsly)
I lowkey thought this video was going to be about his dog Diva. I hope he's still holding up strong. I know hes in bad health. Whew.
What he's not telling us is that his nail tech left too. Hence, no nails...

Bruh he made such a big deal about it I almost thought he was leaving YouTube. Honestly I wouldn't even think anybody would be sad or disappointed...
pleas don't stop whit youtube  I love you
I was so happy but then I remembered rich people never go away even if we beg them to.
Boring repetitive stuff why have you not spoke on anything you’ve not even defended your “best friend” Shane? You’ve been so nasty to so many and your just gonna ignore it all and make an over dramatic half naked video as always with the deep breaths and and over exaggerated “drama” like ok I’m sorry your editor moved on meanwhile people are getting killed in the streets becoming homeless loosing their businesses and all you do is flaunt your wealth and take the piss out of the poor! Do you not remember where you started Jesus
Came for the tea. Stayed to watch the dogs play
Eres. Bello
Can somebody tell me what he talks about I don’t feel like listening
when everyone is upset cause they EXPECTED drama... lololololololol  everyone hoping you leave, but they all click the minute a notification goes out lol hahahaahahahah
Saying good riddance
Basically his camera guy is moving
Bruh he made such a big deal about it I almost thought he was leaving YouTube.
goddamnit you’re not leaving :((( another day of suffering.
Hello I’m new!
What is this freakshow? 🤮
See if Danny Todd will do it
BEACH! I thought this was gonna end with me sobbing. Best wishes for your cristian's journey!
I remember the comments roasting whoever was filming that video 😂  it was terrible and everyone was asking where Christian is.
Ur gross
Please don't come back
I live in Casper and was wondering when we can get a ranch/Casper home tour?
i wish to see a day in those pomeranians life (like with a go pro).
trying to do  some 'tempting crotch shots' to keep this interesting?  your life is so drama, so emotional. good luck with the major shifts.
Don't understand why there are so many hateful comments. Instead of saying something positive to somebody a lot of people decide to go completely out of their way to say such negative things. People will never change
Eww who tf are you
Bye
Thank god.
Let me tell you something u are going to hell
Hahaha I’m dead 😂😂😂😂😂
dang it i thought this she-man thing was leaving youtube 😔
Omfg I would love to be your assistant or camera person lmfao
Tom McDonald, is that you?
Honestly it would be so cute if he made a video of his dogs swimming this summer
Wow, cool. You tried to pull in more views from people who wouldn't likely ever give you a view. Shameful. So many hopeful people, disappointed again. But it's fine, it's fine...we all know you're not gonna be on this platform forever. We. Can. Wait.
Clickbait from the troll of the beauty community 🖕🏾.
Uhh okay?
I have a feeling this is more than just a couple of his staff moving on... perhaps he can't afford to keep them on anymore 🤔
why tf is this in my recommended, ew
About time
Can you 📌 this..
Get outa my recommended
Didn’t ask
I watched the dogs the entire time

Goodbye!
Oh boi, what drama is it this time?

Oh boi, what drama is it this time?
i wish this scarecrow would go goodbye lol.......
The fact that Youtube made a clickbait video trending
booo we want YOU gone
I'm going to miss you.
*Stop talking like that. Ur a dude.*
By you won’t be missed
Just watched and I am receiving from my 2nd open heart. I've been fixed but have to find a new career, I can no longer be a heavy machine operator.  I am early 40s and kids are grown. I have never been any ones personal asst but I raised 2 young productive men. Idk just thought I'd mention myself for your new asst. Sure u are getting bombed with this but in being for real. Absolutely adore you. Good luck and best wishes
This is so fake
pop up the dislike
He gets to the point at 11:24
Jeff you should make a covid makeup line 👀....
Hello! Californian who will work for makeup 💄 💗. Jk but I wish you all the luck
you’d think he would have learned from the last “apology” about the fucking gucci robe or whatever lmao
I mean Jeffrees lower is giving him good advise like to stop making videos cuz if we forget about him he won’t go to jail
First world problems 😅😅
jeffree star: it's time to say good bye.  Also jeffree star: see you guys soon
Anyone know how to block a YouTube channel? I don't want this cringe to pop up on my YouTube homepage anymore.
Delete your channel then
Bye
the dogs are KILLING ME
Ok
Jeffrees camera quality is better than my eye 👁 quality.
Why you dress like a girl your a boy
Just wanted to laugh bc do you know how many “Goodbye YouTube” videos I’ve seen from YouTubers who are still on here?😂👋🏿 Goodbye Jeffrey Star, I guess. I mean, you stayed in some mess
love ur hair
Why does this shit has 17M subs?
I mean, I don’t normally say anything about Jeffree but,  I honestly don’t find this surprising. Obviously. I dislike how you always just say “Sorry” or just address the stuff going around, you never change nor show that you’ve become better because you have impulse issues (don’t deny it), and don’t try to become better to be honest, I don’t want you to, it’s not in my place to tell you that, I’m not your fan. It’s all in the fact that you’re going to be the same and we can’t change that.   I’m surprised in one thing though, that you have fans. They love you because - It’s all behind that mask, we all know, except your followers, you’re lucky to have loyal fans, they’d defend you with their stupidity and act like what you did in the past and present is ok - when it’s not. You probably hurt those two people and made them leave, it’s your own doing and you can’t say that it’s not. I don’t like you but I’m not going to rage about it, it’s useless and I’m going to get hate from your fanbase, regardless if I expressed the things I wanted to tell you in the nicest way possible.  I’m not the one who should be telling you the way I feel because I’m not a “victim” of your doings, but it just makes me think how you could be this dumb to be hurting people all over again and act like it’s all light in a video.   Your words and your fans’ words mean nothing, you can’t erase what you did to people, your false apologies can’t change it, nothing can. You’ve done too much to back out, Jeffree. If I’m sounding rude, I don’t apologise, this is what I feel toward you and I don’t regret my choice of not watching your videos, your support of a vile p*do made me puke, it reminded me of my own experience and I hate you for that, bringing something from the “past” is bad, I guess I agree but this is something serious, in my opinion, and I don’t want to ignore it, you never got the consequences, if you did, I bet all your fans defended you. You’re probably deleting comments and I don’t want to bother going any longer, this just sounds like Shane’s letter thing he made.  So, short answer: I don’t like you, Jeffree. I want you to quit YouTube and think about your mental Health, get therapy and never come back. You need it, it might be addictive to be on YouTube but I’m sure you can retire, do it and sit back in your place, enjoy life off social media. You’re 30 something, you need to enjoy your life without drama and most importantly, without hurting any more people, that all sounds really good right now.  (Get it? Sorry...)
I’m praying this isn’t click bait
you are just the weirdest like why!
Bitch is not a bitch, it’s a dog
B by gig.
Anyone else come here just to dislike
Clickbait. Still not taking accountability for anything. Didn't fire your terrible hair stylist. Nothing has changed. Why in the world did I click this or leave a comment.
Is it just me that hates him?
Jefreestar: *Saying goodbye* Me: *I don’t even watch this channel* Also me: *Clicks*
*adjusts camera while filming, deep breaths* haven’t seen this before
Content has been boring lately. He needs a young boyfriend like Nathan to spice things up. I still enjoy watching but his old videos were more entertaining.
yeahhhh im sure they didnt leave cause you treat everyone whos around like scum of the earth... sure it wasnt that... theres no tea cause you paid them off.
i wonder what his face feels like
click bait much
I’m a huge fan and i had to click on this cause I thought he was quitting youtube and I’m watching and HE IS or is he
Final Jeffree Stars leaving YouTube
I thought he was gonna say chris died 💀💀🤣🤣
Screw this video, Get Alpha Beasts trending
Yo how you gonna sit here and wish 2021 is a little more unforgiving?!
Jeffree looks like the handsome version of Squidward
Goodbye nigga

Who are you, why did you show up on my feed and why the hell should I even care???  Get over yourself...

"I just miss traveling 😔" talks about going back and forth to a ranch in a different state.
I hope this new beginning will be good for you queen! ❤👑
Better than the Chinese chick I got red before
HAHAHAHAHAHAHA
Just leave already... don't make 200 "Goodbye" videos
The amount of times Jeffree Star was nearly canceled
I see a pink collection coming
*Me getting my tissues ready because the channel was getting deleted*                                          *camera man?*
I might not like you, but you got some nice dogs
Could you just disappear into the fucking ether already Byeeeeeeee
Time to quit YouTube when CRAP like this is recommended to me! Please grow up!
NOOOO DON'T LEAVE you piece of trash
Oh no! I like Chris! Hope he's happy onward though. So who's gonna be ur new camera dude?
Thank God, You aren't leaving us!!! I got scared and sad! @jeffreestar You honestly bring happiness into my life, and I absolutely LOVE WATCHING YOU <3 PLEASE DON'T EVER CHANGE!
Jeffree Star number 1 clickbaiter
Ratio
How much do you talk to the people in Kaycee??
maybe it is a sign you need to simplify your life...
Why don’t you do it your self 👁👄👁
You should have done this a looooooooooong time ago
Jeffree talking about his camera man moving on to better things like he's died for 10 minutes....  👁️👄👁️.... Also, can we talk about when he mentioned shane's series like nothing has happened with Shane in the past year🙈🤣 jeeeezzzz... Money really does go to some people's heads..
WTF IS THIS???!!!!! 😁😁😁😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 PA LLORAR
Seeing how much support and fans Jeffrwe star has shows exactly how discusting the state of the world is....
Ahahah #ripbozo #restinpiss
Love the hair, light and dark pink and bows on the top of ur head in reverse colors. I want this hair style.
I SCREAMED  I HOPE HE QUITS LMAO
Finally
We don’t care
Why do we even give attention to people like this who lie, are manipulative and shittalk the whole time? Why did 16 million people decided to press that subscribe button? Why did i, why did all of us click on this video which does not even make any fucking sense? Stop making stupid people famous and rich. Stop being so bored with your life to be interested in a human totally drifted away from reality.
He’s mad that his pallet flopped that’s what this is really about
If you haven’t watch meatcanyon’s video representing the makeup community, do yourself a favor and go watch it. It’s pretty much canon on YouTube at this point.
We really have this on trending when Rosé just dropped a beautiful song? Ok🙄🤚🏼
Good sir. As iconic as you are…  I. Don’t. Have. Eleven. Minutes. For. You. To. Say. Goodbye.  I’m sorry  but- no.
Me: Geez fuck what a pain he is Also me: let's not be mean, MAYBE he does have issues
Stay lovely.likr u r my.dRling baby

NOT THE BEGINNING
Damn and I thought this pos was finally leaving YouTube
Ugh.  Please leave for real.  Your content is contrived, manipulative and dusty.  And you look a fool.  It’s not working for you anymore sis.
I love you Jeffri star (;O;)
Bi den.

ABSOLUTE MASTER OF SELF-CREATED DRAMA.  JFC.   Is there a need for us to know your HR/PERSONNEL CHANGES??  NO.  also  Put the damned dogs in the other room.   Stop with the dramatic breaths and sighs.  IT'S NOT THAT IMPORTANT SIS.

Ok what the fuck
Heyy biatch... Love u..your amazing ❤🤗
Lol
Your gross
Can someone give me a summary? I don't want to watch this.
Turning Camera on and not cutting it out ... Check Deep Breathing and at the brink of crying ... Check "It's been so long" ... Check
Goodbye, stick to ur word and never come back
Bye
I thought you were leaving.. I'm disappointed to say the least.
byeeee
Not him trending 😭🖐🏻
Sweetheart... so, you're telling us two of your 'staff' haven't died in this pandemic? Ok, so, what do the dirty people (outside your barbed wire bubble) need to do to help you? To assure you they have moved on and started new lives in a un suffocating environment? You are saying all this... oh my life has changed in the last few years blah blah... you are a spoilt child... working or not... you are a brat!! The only thing you can do to redeem yourself is to bring Shane back. That is all.
Sis I don’t got a life and I’m loyal and free :))))
simple if ur saying mean things to be mean and not sharing constructive criticism which this video doesn’t seem to need bc it’s not about make up it’s a personal story and it doesn’t matter if someone is regular class or famous don’t leave a unnecessary comment this video doesn’t change your life so let people be it’s 2021 grow up
Your what  would come out of the microwave if you put Mariah Carey in it for 5 minutes
Why are some of yall saying yall hope he was leaving youtube?
Kinda disappointed with this... No drama, what about all these shane accusations??? How about the real stuff? Whatever, live you life I gues
not me thinking he was finally leaving.
God bless him. Everyone deserves happiness, including him :)
The baby is so feisty! I LOVE IT! SO CUTE!
BOY PLEASE
2v2 to the dogs lol
Nice click bait
It's always the big SIGH 🙄🤚🏾
I don’t know if it’s my short attention span, but I cannot listen to this guy speak for more than 30 seconds
This is the biggest self centered bunch of usual bull shit you always spread. Clickbait. You care nothing for anyone but yourself, only friends you have or any relationship you have.. well they get paid well for silence until you get bored. You take zero accountability for any of your actions. You are the drama. Its just the same lying crap from you over and over. But God let this be true and bye.  Don't let the door hit you where the good Lord split you and you made fake and have a huge fetish over. Until you really become a better person and we all that will never happen. Lets see how fast this gets deleted.
ok goodbye
In 2000, I'd never thought I'd see a world where I'm watching a video on my phone of a man pretending to be a woman catered by the audience who insist he's a woman
I’m not usually the one to write a comment like this: but literally nobody gives a single fuck about saying goodbye to Chris.
half this video is breathing and dogs fighting
So unblock me on Instagram jeffree 😅😅
Thank fk
Unfortunately yall he's not leaving. Just saying bye to his camera man 😒
You are so far out of touch it would be funny if it weren't so insulting
no one cares bruv
"I have a big important announcement to make, but not so big that I'm actually going to get dressed"... like tacky
So...is he just trying to make us feel bad for him?? Cuz it ain’t working for me. Sorry not sorry..
TL;DR: his camera man is leaving
Not chrisssssss and Maddie 😭
This is the first video I’ve ever watched of this person and he or she is leaving. Cool
He is a human being. He is allowed to choose to show his life or not. Ans he's allow to make changes in his own life. If he needs a break, that's wonderful for him! People need breaks! Rich or poor, man or woman. Hes a fucking human being. So judge because that shows your negative side, but its no one's business but his what he CHOOSES to show. Take a break Jeffrey.  Do what you need to. Same with everyone else. We have all been kicked in the ass by this global bullshit so no one has the right to judge anyone else. Be humble.
Sad, pathetic really.
The alien is going back to its home planet 🥳
Good
Why is this disgusting excuse of a human being still allowed on YouTube?
Cool IDC
jeffree star: it's time to say good bye.  Also jeffree star: see you guys soon
IDGAF! (IM NOT SAYING THIS BECAUSE YOUR TRANSGENDER)
Idc just go away
A future millionaire will like the comment
Let's get it crackin
Please go away and never come back!
Knigge you gay
I also wonder who did that ugly ass wig on your head! I bet it was Hair By Jay lmao
Dude no one cares you freak of nature
Can I be your new assistant!???  I would kick ass!
GOODBYE AND GOOD GRIEF! NEVER COME BACK!!
Doggies stole the show!!
Good riddance.
L
who are you
Why are you transgender
This dude looks redeculios
Jeff, you are a fantastic actor being all sad, but u are lonely, it’s in your eyes .....for real
You poor thing. The pandemic must be so hard for you.
Today, my friends we celebrate the first year anniversary of wearing masks.
Jeffree please never feel like you have to post if you don’t feel well. Your mental health and well being comes first always. To the people who say he only posts when he’s selling something, so tf what? There are millions of business owners who don’t even have a YouTube channel. You don’t have to create content to sell things they’re not mutually exclusive and it’s definitely not a requirement. there is nothing wrong with marketing your products and sharing things you’ve been working on that is what business is. Any person with a brain can tell he’s incredibly passionate about his brand and that is why his products are so good. ❤️
Bye Jeffree, We won’t miss you
Jeffre Star- “I’m leaving”  Two weeks later- 👁👄👁💅 Uhm so anyways                                      👗                                    👠👠
Finally........ Goodbye.
I wish you all the best, please stay safe be Love from Canada❤️😉
Only people who didn’t come from tiktok are worthy of liking this comment
Saying goodbye to Chris and Maddie.... Really!!!!  I was hoping he'd say he's saying goodbye to YouTube.
Finally bye
No one want to work w/ u Karen.
cya
Don’t let the door hit you in the ass on your way out
Jesus loves you guys 🇧🇼
Jeffery Lynn looking like cardi B with this hair 😆💖
Dammit I thought he was leaving
ghhheeeeeeeeeeeeeyyyy
I don't even know what that thing is.
John 3:16-17 16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. 17 For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. Romans 6:23 23 For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Romans 10:9-10 9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.10. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. Amen
Okay
Oh my gosh I forgot this person existed :'\
get out of youtube 👍🏿
Okay bye
Why in the fuck was this recommended
Hi. I'm from Lebanon. It's been a really difficult year for many of us and this is not the right place  to ask. BUT me and my family are in desperate need of help!! Even if only 1 person is willing to  help it would be deeply appreciated❤️
she is very beautiful
C L I C K B A I T
This dude trending number 1 for a clickbait Smfh YouTube better stop playing with my girl rosé! Everyone go check out rosé on the ground new music video she is very talented
Good
literally just opened the video, paused it, went to the comments to see if he's leaving, got to know he isn't and now i'm closing the video, nice talk, goodbye.
Yeah you need to go bc people like you need to go to jail for touching little boys  need to goooo!!!  I know everything jeffree star you need help what you done was sick
Ugh he's not qutting goddamit
Omg! This title made my heart stop! I was like oh no oh no JEFFfrrEEeEeE don’t leave me!!!! Lol but my heart had stabilized and wish Chris the best! Love ya!
I don’t know why people are so harsh is the comments if you don’t like him why bother looking at his videos? Why bother putting down an ugly comment? Why bother? Clearly there are some people with to much time on their hands and spending that time hating.  the world would be a lot prettier if everyone keeps their opinion to them self. Put yourself in his place and think about it. ❤️🌸.
Lol
Who else is reading comments and listening to Jeffree at the same time?
lol bye
Gai
I seen you on TV before but you run trending hasn't clicked on this I am so confused but cute dogs by the way
Find God the Kingdom of God is at hand love Him talk to Him cherish Him have a GREAT day
I saw this in trending and I’m so happy when I saw the title
Finally
Why is this trending in 20 hours?
Bye 🥱
lets hope this is true
Like 30% of the related videos are serial killer documentaries and I _refuse_ to believe this is a coincidence.
Me putting 1.75x for him to get to the point and me being disappointed that I even watch the video
Promise?
Jafar Starfish: I’m leaving 😭😭 Everyone: okay bye

Love from SA 🇿🇦  ❤❤❤

We only wish you were saying goodbye 😂😂
Love you bad bitch <3
🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
Why oh why did I watch this?
I feel like he knew this was gonna trick a lot of people and maybe it's just me but I'm a lil suspicious by that, does he think he's going downhill so he's gotta grab people's attention for views?? idk lots of love thou
Losing everyone but the hair dresser I guess mkkkkkkk
Fuck, I thought this dude was gonna quit...ahh perhaps next time.
Title: Saying Goodbye... Me: Good riddance~ 🤪✌
Jeffery star, more like Jeffery Epstein.
Oh my Dear God, Not the sad music playing in the background tho??
do people actually watch this guy?
The only good thing about this is his deoggies being crazy. Also his photographers leaving thats it
https://youtu.be/X0CqqFshe9w
Bye!
dang i thought this was a suicide video :/
Only 11mins and y'all complaining how long it is........brrruuuuh he just talking just yeet yourself away from the video if u don't care.  Damn imagine losing two close friends in the same year....2020 did a number on everyone.
Was this a part of your soul contract with Satan? Many souls have gone astray
Just came by to say I don't care. AYO.
Clickbait as usual. I wish he were leaving tho
Aww Jeffree, ur strong you’ll be able to figure things out. Keep working through ur art and your pigments because ur cosmetics are phenomenal and I appreciate the honest reviews. Cant deny that.
Finally
ok i want to be the personal assistant 😩
I wish I had the money to pay you just to delete your channel 🥺
TU É GAY MANO TA FICANDO CRAZY
Is this what the Internet has come to?
Goodbye gross “man”
It was so nice to see you Jeffree! I always enjoy your videos when you’re just Jeffree doing your thing.  I’m sure this time has been very emotional! I wish Chris and Maddie luck and believe things will change and be good for you as well 😊
You'll be back
Bye
This is what’s trending at #1 instead of Hailey Bieber’s YouTube channel? 😳🙄😒
Damn
wtf is this
Lol I love the long sighs and taking forever to say whata going on 😂😂😂 great actor maybe u should go into acting JS. Your funny! Lol
Oh dear, and adding on top the little fling who turned into judas. You really need to be careful, bc people are jealous of your success and then want to see you falling so bad. I really do not share those bad wishes, just bc im too busy minding my own life and wish everyone do well, as much as i do.
Jesus Christ is the only way to the father. Jesus said all of you who carry heavy burden go to him and he’ll give you REST.  REPENT for the forgiveness of sin and eternal life.
My daughter loves your eyeshadows..she has several...very high quality! Sorry about the departure of Chris but happy for him to move on with the next chapter in his life and may he have the best of luck. Same with with Madelynn, hope she has the best of luck also in her next chapter of her life.
Cancel YouTube creator's for letting guys pretending to be a girl on this web ,WE are the viewers and We're  supposed to control NO ONE OWNS THIS APP
Be careful with your bears. We're supposed to get at least a foot of snow.
NUT
Yaye finally
Wtf why did wtf get auto corrected to egg WTF anyway why the fuck is this trending on NUMBER 1 WTF
https://youtu.be/2FkJ4PB3vHk
This  whole thing is basically a cult.
Jesus died for your sins. he did while we were yet still sinners, if we were put in court and God as the judge he will be a good judge and send us to hell because we have broken the ten commandments and when you break one commandment you break all. but he sent Jesus out as a ransom to take the place for you, Gods wrath was taken on the son for you and me to be saved, we trust in Jesus not so we don’t go to hell but because he SAVED us from hell. We put our faith in Jesus because he first loved us, does this mean we keep on sinning? No! but we turn away from our sins and change our direction and will of our lives because he took us away from the fire while it was still hot, repent and trust in the who first loved us when no one did.
K bye
Oh it’s just chris leaving? I got excited I thought it was jefferee
Wth is this thing? Why is it on my recommendation?
WARZONE Season 2 - Goodbye FFAR

Chris & Maddie lynn will be missed. People can't forever be your camera man or personal assistant. But they can be your forever friends. Jeffree you will be okay. Your are a strong bitch. You will find people that are good & fit to your life. Love you Jeffree.
Why can’t you actually just leave you miserable excuse for a human being?

BiHF

Hailey: 2 on trending Jefre: Am I a joke to you?
One doesn’t experience self-transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates🔻
You might as well transition into a woman
“Saying goodbye”  Me: you, you will?
Bye mr  star have great life with all your houses businesses money cars custom everything pom pom dogs and fake people in life  Still wish best for you that you find the good in you
Next time make your workers sign a contract so they won’t just drop out your life. They need to be contractually obligated to find you the next qualified camera person or assistant. They messin up your money.
Good riddance
BaaaaBYEEEEEE 👋🏻
I can think of 5 things that are more interesting
Wtf did i just watch?. This is bs.
So?

Hey man, the best thing you can do is come to Jesus Christ. He is the only one who can permanently take away your anxiety, stress, and fear. Not only that, but he is willing to forgive you ALL your sins, past, present, and future. It sounds too good to be true, but it’s not. “For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only begotten son, so that whoever believes in him shall not perish, but have everlasting life. - John 3:16 This is more than just a random bible verse. This verse perfectly encapsulates the purpose and mission of Jesus. He is not waiting for you to mess up so that he can throw you into hell. That is what the devil wants - not Jesus. Jesus not only wants to make your life the best, most fulfilling life possible; he also wants for you  to live with him in heaven forever. 🐑🐬🕊🕊
We all expected a goodbye.. but not this one just go already
Please just leave 😬
Wtf is that
Chris gonna have the best life ever i guess the dog could have the life also😊
Well, we'll see how long leaving yt takes. Lol
🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮 this dude is weird
Me: looking at the comments  My brain: how do people get 12k in 19 hours  Thoughts in my brain: i wish i got that many likes it would a dream
Please quit. You’ve hurt enough people.
"allots been going on" yeah I'm sure getting called out for the wrongs you did in the past was allot, in fact it was so much that your sales aren't even doing as great as they once did. You won't ever go back to your emo days jeffree star where you were literally carrying trash bags as a purse but your shitty attitude from those emo days stay, and that's why you're fucked.
Casper thanks you
Thanks for leaving
K
This comment wont get over 100 likes

Is this trending vedio🤨...which no.1?🧐🤔❤️
We all know your secretly toxic af..”no tea “ my ass !! 🙄😂😂😂 We want to here the other sides of the story.
La muerte, es uno de los eventos más grandes que jamás tendrá lugar en tu vida.  Afrontamos la muerte todos los días, consciente o inconscientemente de ella; la muerte acecha en cada rincón de nuestra vida. Como un león esperando atrapar a su presa, la muerte nos llega a todos en muchas formas y formas; aparentemente no hay nadie que pueda escapar de las fauces de la muerte.  ¿Pero sabías que hay una razón por la que morimos? La idea de la muerte con la que está familiarizado es solo la punta del iceberg. Mira, morimos porque hemos pecado contra Dios. La muerte según la Biblia es paga "porque la paga del pecado es muerte" (Romanos 6:23).Debido a que el hombre pecó contra Dios, vivimos en un mundo caído, antes era perfecto, pero ahora está en ruinas. Ahora que el pecado existe, Dios viene a juzgar al mundo con justicia. Está establecido que un hombre muera una vez y después de este juicio "(Hebreos 9:27). El estándar por el que te juzgará son los 10 mandamientos, la ley moral de Dios.  Él es tan serio acerca del pecado que le dio a cualquiera que pecara la sentencia de muerte, la Biblia dice que te la has ganado pecando contra Dios y cada vez que pecas, acumula su ira. "El alma que pecare, esa morirá". (Ezequiel 18: 4) El castigo son los fuegos eternos del Infierno "Donde habrá llanto y crujir de dientes" (Mateo 13:42)  Tendrás que enfrentarte a Dios el Día del Juicio.  ¿Irás al cielo o al infierno?  Aquí hay una prueba rápida:  1-No tendrás otros dioses delante de mí. 2-No harás ídolos. 3-No tomarás el nombre del Señor tu Dios en vano, porque el Señor no dará por inocente al que tome su nombre en vano. 4-Recuerda el día de reposo. 5-Honra a tu padre y a tu madre. 6-No matarás. 7-No cometerás adulterio. 8-No robarás. 9-No mentirás. 10-No codiciarás.  ¿Alguna vez has dicho una mentira? robado algo? usó el nombre de Dios en vano? ¿Alguna vez has mirado a alguien con lujuria? Él ve la lujuria como adulterio, “Cualquiera que mira a una mujer con codicia, ya adulteró con ella en su corazón” (Mateo 5:28). ¿Alguna vez has odiado a alguien? él ve el odio como un asesinato, "Cualquiera que odie a otro hermano o hermana es un homicida" (1 Juan 3:15)  Santiago 2:10 dice, "la persona que guarda todas las leyes excepto una es tan culpable como una persona que ha quebrantado todas las leyes de Dios".  No confíe en su propia bondad o buenas obras para salvarlo. Eso es como sobornar a Dios para que te deje entrar al cielo; Ni una iglesia, pastor, sacerdote o religión alguna. Ninguno de nosotros es bueno en absoluto, incluso los asesinos, violadores, incluso Hilter se llamarán buenos y tratarán de justificarse por sus buenas obras. Pero la biblia dice:  • "Pero todos somos como cosa inmunda, y todas nuestras justicias son como trapos de inmundicia; nos marchitamos como una hoja, y nuestras iniquidades, como el viento nos llevaron". (Isaías 64: 6)  La definición de Dios del bien es moralmente excelente y, por lo tanto, exige perfecciones absolutas. Nadie puede igualar sus estándares. Por eso Jesús dijo: • "Nadie es bueno sino solo Dios". (Lucas 18:19)  Si ha hecho alguna de esas cosas, Dios lo ve como culpable de quebrantar su ley y la Biblia advierte que los culpables terminarán en el infierno. ¿Serás culpable el día del juicio final?  "Porque la paga del pecado es muerte, pero la dádiva de Dios es vida eterna en Cristo Jesús Señor nuestro". (Romanos 6:23)  Dios envió a su Hijo a sufrir y morir en la cruz. Jesús tomó el castigo sobre sí mismo y derrotó a la muerte en la cruz; no por tu Bien sino porque Dios es rico en misericordia.  "Porque tanto amó Dios al mundo que dio a su Hijo unigénito, el que en él cree no se pierda, sino que tenga vida eterna". (Juan 3:16)  Jesús resucitó de entre los muertos y venció a la muerte. Arrepiéntete (vuélvete del pecado) hoy y confía en Jesús y Dios te concederá vida eterna; también nacerás de nuevo.  Él te dará un corazón nuevo que desea la justicia, lo que es justo y un corazón que amará a Dios.  por eso Jesús dijo: "De cierto, de cierto os digo, que el que no nazca de nuevo, no puede ver el reino de Dios". (Juan 3: 3)  Luego, lea la Biblia y obedezca lo que lee.  ☆ ¿Cuándo vas a estar bien con Dios?  "Hoy, si escuchan su voz, no endurezcan su corazón como lo hicieron en la rebelión" (Hebreos 3:15) "Ahora es el tiempo aceptable, he aquí ahora el día de salvación". (2 Corintios 6: 2)  • "Tampoco hay salvación en ningún otro, porque no hay otro nombre bajo el cielo dado a los hombres en el que podamos ser salvos". (Hechos 4:12)  Es tu elección. Los dejo con esto: "¿De qué le aprovechará al hombre si gana el mundo entero y pierde su alma?" (Marcos 8:36).  Si te estás tomando esto en serio, ¿te gustaría una oración? Esta oración no es garantía de que serás salvo, eso es entre tú y Dios. Sin embargo, me gustaría que este fuera un buen comienzo para su viaje.  "Padre, te agradezco por el corazón abierto de esta persona y le pido que se arrepienta y confíe solo en Jesucristo. También te pido que guíes sus pasos en su camino para que pasen de la muerte a la vida. En el nombre de Jesús Amén.

Death, it's one of the biggest events that will ever take place in your life. We face death everyday, conscious or unconsciously of it; death lurks around every corner of our life. Like a lion waiting to catch its prey, death comes for us all in many shapes and form; seemingly there is no one who can escape from the jaws of death. But did you know there is a reason why we die? The idea of death you're familiar with is only the tip of the iceberg. See we die because we've sinned against God. Death according to the bible is wages " for the wages of sin is death " (Romans 6:23). Because man sinned against God, we live in a fallen world, it was once perfect, but now in ruins. Now that sin exists, God is coming to judge the world In righteousness. "It's appointed a man once to die and after this judgement" (Hebrews 9:27) The standard he'll judge you by is the 10 commandments, God's moral law. He's so serious about sin that he gave anyone who sins the death sentence, the bible says you've earned it through sinning against God and God pays you in death. each time you sin you build up his wrath. “The soul who sins shall die.” (Ezekiel 18:4) The punishment is the eternal fires of Hell " Where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth" (Matthew 13:42) You will have to face God on Judgement Day.  Will you go to Heaven or Hell? Here’s a quick test:  1.You shall have no other gods before Me. (Have you always loved God above all else?)  2.You shall not make yourself an idol. (Have you made a god in your mind that you're more comfortable with, a god to suit yourself?)  3.You shall not take God's name in vain. (Have you ever used God's holy Name as a cuss word?)  4.Remember the Sabbath Day, to keep it holy.  5.Honor your father and mother.  6. You shall not murder. (God considers hatred to be as murder, 1 John 3:15).  7. You shall not commit adultery. ("Whoever looks upon a woman to lust after her has committed adultery with her already in his heart" Matthew 5:27-28; this also includes sex before marriage).  8. You shall not steal. (Have you ever stolen anything? the value of the item is irrelevant).  9. You shall not lie. (Have you lied even once? Including answering these questions).  10. You shall not covet. (Have you ever jealously desired what belongs to others?)  James 2:10 says, “the person who keeps all of the laws except one is as guilty as a person who has broken all of God’s laws.”   The Bible says that God will punish all murderers, rapists, thieves, liars, adulterers, etc. He will even judge our words and thoughts.  If you have done any of those things, God sees you as guilty of breaking His law and the Bible warns that the guilty will end up in Hell. Will YOU be guilty on Judgement Day?   "For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord." (Romans 6:23)  God sent His Son to suffer and die on the cross. Jesus took the punishment upon Himself and defeated death on the cross; not because your Good but because God is rich in mercy.  “For God so loved the world that He gave His only Son, whoever believes in Him should not perish but have eternal life.” (John 3:16)  Jesus rose from the dead and defeated death. Repent (turn from sin) today and trust in Jesus and God will grant you everlasting life.  Then, Read the Bible and obey what you read.  Pray something like this:  "Dear God, today I turn away from all of my sins (name them). This day I put my trust in Jesus Christ as my Lord and Savior. He is the only way for me to be saved. He is 'The way, the truth, and the life.'" Please forgive me, change my heart, and grant me Your gift of everlasting life. In Jesus' name I pray. Amen."

If you have a medium or tarot reader who you trust, I would utilize their talents as you’re interviewing new people. As long as you’re not say goodbye to US, I’m ok. Lol. You have been a major favorite channel so keep being you because it’s what your viewers want and need. And still loving all your products. And love your doggies too.   Sending you blessings, love and light! You always remind me of the curb your enthusiasm episode with Krazyeyes killer (on demand) when you call on Delicious, please check it out. It’s a hilarious episode and when you see the scene I’m talking about during the house tour, I guarantee you’ll be deee- lighted!
Hummm he's lonely 😔
Good riddance <3

THE CAMERA ADJUST AT THE START I CAN'T ABDBVD
Damnit I thought he was quitting YouTube
I can hold a potato, I will come film for you.
good leave
This better be real lmao
Thank you though for saying you are getting the vaccine. You are helping out more than you know.
"My personal assistant and my cameraman left and I can't travel anymore because of the p*nd* mic. It's a lot. It's been really hard. My family is getting settled in my ranch in Wyoming whilst I live in my multi-million-dollar LA home and travel back and forth. I know I'm strong but it's been a lot! I know I'm gonna figure it out. Pray for me you guys!" What am I watching!? How far gone is he, seriously?!
How does this clown have millions in disposable income and our nurses need food boxes??? Wtf?
Can someone just give me the highlights of what this video is so I don’t have to watch it all???
Shout out to his family
We love clickbaiting drama because that’s the only way you can get views now
I’m sorry, I’m immune compromised as well as my children and I can’t get the vaccine why the fuck does he get it
Go watch alpha betas
finally 😫
I've never watched a video from this creator. I don't normally watch content like this. This is my internal thought chemistry in the first 30 seconds.  Woah that's a lot of tatoos.  Voice is very feminine.  Hair is very very pink and long and shiny.  Immediate cognitive dissonance from the clashing of so many subjectively contrary features. Male, feminine, tatoos, long pink hair. Its fundamentally jarring to my subconscious presuppositions.  Awareness of subconscious reaction follows.  Its very interesting, I had no idea until watching this that I had so many emotional presuppositions within my background thoughts, nor was I aware of how dissonant and uncomfortable it would make me feel, outside of any actual value judgements.  Interesting data. A man does not know himself unless he pays a lot of attention I suppose.
Makes me laugh how alot of people hating on Jeffery arnt bringing that energy to james charles the Predator
bye
Why is this on my recommended
بسم الله الله يأخذ شكلك يا وقح
Ok... so... who asked??

The fact this is trending as #1 just shows the quality of the current society we live in. How embarrassing
Clap if you care......

Woah woah woah woah wait wait......           we don’t care
Super nice real talk.
Never watched a single one of your vids , but clicked in hope you were leaving YouTube and I would never have to see or hear about you again
I love you Jeffree 💗
The dogs greatly distract me in a good way
can youtubers not just fucking cut to the part where theyve already setup the camera
*week after this video*  Andreai: Wilfur get over here we got new beef
bye.
Just looking out of my window trying to find who the fuck asked
Favorite part of the video 11:11
clickbait
Why is this on my recommended i don’t care at all
❤❤
Bye sister
Can anybody tell why this video is trending 1. in my country
I don't even know him but I got worried lol
Let’s go
I've been watching you since 2015. Good luck to Maddie and Chris.
The “goodbye” titles get me every dang time
Gay
Loving that hair
I don’t know who is Jeffrey Star
I didn't watch the video assuming this is not click bait who actually legitimately cares?
Hey Jeffree, if you need someone to help you out I think I could be of use. Im from Canada and I'm 20 IBM if you want as I'd love to hear from you 😊 anyways cheers for now
我操！！！给封面误导了！
I don’t wanna watch the entire thing it’s to much of a waste of time someone tell me is he quitting YouTube or not?
This is a breathe of fresh air, I pray you find someone as trust worthy and also Likable as Chris has been. He will be missed 😌💙💙 bitter sweet but everyone has to move on someday
why r there still so many jeffree stans pls are y’all not aware of what he did or-
The quality of the camera is better than my vision Wtf
goodbye lol
leaving YouTube 😭😭
who cares
It will eventually get back to normal, Jeffery!   Hey..I want to see what you’ve done to the house and the additional house you wanted for makeup products, etc...I am curious!  Did you pink out the pool?  I literally haven’t seen you in ages...just saw this vid and decided to check it out. I would definitely help you out as an assistant , etc...but I live in the Midwest and I have a herd of cats...so I am not going to be going anywhere! 😉
Please, for the love of God, let the bathrobes go .
I ❤️ you 🌟.  You got this.
Why is this in my recommended
aw i was hoping jefree was leaving the platform :(
🐕🐕🐕🐕🐕🐕🐕🐕🐾🐾🐾⭐🤩
Ugh

About time you are leaving....Tired of seeing my trending tab always clogged up with your horrible face. Move on little girl/boy. Hopefully you never show your face again.
Get off of rosé’s trending page skeletor

What happened to Maddie tho
Another attempt of Jafar Star to stay relevant 🙄
Please actually go away
pls leave youtube. k thanks
K Bye
damn thought you were leaving the platform, maybe next time.
finally. gay.
It is hard when people decide its time to move on especially when they have been with you so long and you have become family and you have become sounding boards for each other not to mention the trust you have for each other .  But life has changed a whole lot for everyone these past two years and there has been a lot of reflection on everyone .  It still hurts even though we understand and respect there decisions it’s not easy I feel your pain .  Take care my friend and be safe .
Jeffree, 2021 is the year of change! I'm so excited to meet all the new crew !!! Your right we so can tell the difference in your videos chris was awsome!! So excited for them both to fly there own wings!! Jeffree you have come so far in the last 5 years!!!! I live in casper wy, and if you need a personal assistant here im down! To bigger and better things!!!
jeffree we don’t care
I thought he was going to quit youtube 🙄
I'm not a fan and I'm just here cause I'm bored af
Byyeeeeeeeeee

My disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined

I clicked on this video thinking he was quitting YouTube... I’m disappointed 😞
I turned my location to USA to see the trending and this is number 1? What's wrong with you people 😂
Did he play in the silent of the lamb ?
lol
Eww
i thought u were leaving youtube 🙄 honestly u should, stop trying to sweep all your problematic behavior under the rug
I can’t believe this is number one on YouTube how sad 😂
the day i care is the days i fly
Oh thank god!!
We’re all going to miss Chris and the quality of the videos. 😢
Intro sounds like a bunch of bees to me
There’s not gossip there’s not drama but of course we have a clickbait video
Lamoo plz what's happening
Sorry to hear your loosing your close staff. I don't like when someone I like from work leaving the team either. Saying goodbye is not fun but hopefully you will get new relationships starting. Glad your getting the vaccin, Canada is still vaccinating the older population. Can't wait to get my vaccin as well. Take care and stay safe.
I won’t say that I was hoping he’d quit YouTube, but...
Bye bye.......
bruh I thought he was leaving yt.. i was happy for a sec
doesn’t effect me!!
I love you jeffree forever! Stay strong 💕
Goodbye 👋
Bye

Why is this on my recommendations

Well good luck on the new camera man! Sorry to hear hes gone he was so sweet and trust worthy!! Nice ending btw Jeffery! Lol 🤣🤣🤣

Finally
Wtf is going on...
*Couldn't care less*
Don't care, bye.
Was really hoping you were leaving dammit
Omg who is happy that he is leaving YouTube 🥰💘

Dammit I thought you were leaving
The fact that this is #1 on trending 🤢🤢🤢
Aw man, I thought you were saying goodbye to YouTube. Thanks for the Clickbait..
Oh no!  Anyway.
Thank god
Nobody  Kanye:

Me thinking he’s leaving: 😃   Me realizing it’s clickbait: 😔
so liked your disrupting rose solour it be highly appreciate too not
https://youtu.be/7T9yMSNG1iQ
wtf why is this in the german youtube trend?
Strange huh? The world has become more concerning. Take time off to worry more about being more human like maybe... -Panzy Mandy
Finally
uhhh excused me rose solour is trending number one get thus out of here skjhfjds h
Good riddance.
We love you Jeffree, better times will come I assure you 🥰💖
I genuinely couldn’t care less
LETSS GOO LESS WEIRDOS ON YOUTUBE
I was really hoping he was leaving YouTube. Now I'm pissed.
Who is this dude?
I generally got exited, I thought he was leaving Youtube
He’s kinda gay no ? I’m just asking
No one cares ☺️
I got Ralph Lauren tattoos on my hands because I couldn't afford Louis Vuitton tattoos!
wow #1 on trending lol
Was hoping you were leaving... 😑
Uhm..bye ig🙄 anyways
Don’t bother giving him views he isn’t leaving youtube
This video’s vibe is totally different. Calm and soothing kind of video. I like it a lot. Plus the dogs are making it more interesting to watch. ❤️
Jeff needs Jesus. Jesus can put him in his right mind.
Where's this man's eyebrows????
Never gonna give you up Never gonna let you down Never gonna run around and desert you Never gonna make you cry Never gonna say goodbye Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you
I couldn’t even concentrate on what he was saying cuz I was to busy watching the dogs lol
I have no idea why I’m here this has nothing to do with me 👁👄👁
وتفففففففك😭😭😭😭😭
So weird holy shit
yay!
I'm only watching for the dogs.
TLDR; everyone quit. Next!
Why do ppl even watch this Psychopath
ok goodbye
*Yo rn it's #1 trending!!!!!*
I wish YouTube makes those reaction emojis like facebook 😂
i thought he died or something ok bye
Русские люди объясните что случилось
*takes 30 deep breaths before speaking*  Jeffree: I’m leaving.... jk new camera guy..  see you guys in my next videoooo!!!
Lucifer awaits you in hell
Love u.
Hi
It's all good. Change is wonderful sometimes.
I got so happy by just reading the tittle.. boys we done it
I'm sorry who am i? hem I mean who are u
Ok....
Yeaa boi gtfo at last
It puts the lotion on its skin !!!
I think he meant 2021 to be a little more forgiving, not unforgiving lol
lol
The trash will not  be missed
Damn, thought we finally got rid of him.
Bye bye you should of left sooner
Good riddance
Yay! No more fucking cringe on jeffreestar
You are the darkness !
I’m sorry that you had to let go of someone so important in your life babe❤️just remember all the memories and push him for the best like you always have!
I don’t care.
I am praying for everyone who needs a Miracle. Only God can do the impossible, He can make a way when there seems to be no way. Today I pray God touches your health, your home, your family, your faith, and your finances. Amen!
Not me staring at his wig the whole video. 🤠
Okay so
What happened to Shane? He fucked him up in the head which I haven’t seen much. Jeffree talked so long he put the dogs to sleep.
CLICK BATE. JEFF, YOUR DONE. ACCEPT IT.
https://youtu.be/kXLu_x0SRm4
Who the fuck is this and why is he in my recommended.
Lol
Who are you? Why do you have so many cute dogs?
Could care less if she/he leaves YT. Less drama and more positive and creative videos from Mr. Beast 😃😃😃
I hope this is real. Bye. Take your friends with you.
I could not care less
Okay cool bye
Byeee 💖💖
No one cares
Goodbye
I dare somebody to count the times he says CRAZY. He’s trying too hard to get sympathy. None from me.
BYEEEEEE
I'm from England originally and now from the avocado capital of the world, California. wow you are awesome, i know what it's like to work with videoograohers and them to move on etc and i only just got started. This is the first video I've seen of you, so awesome. that little doggy scrap made my day! It's great to have this attitude when people move on, even though some times we cry a little.
I love you
Yes please leave
Man.thats a scary looking thing nightmare shit
Thank fucking god you’re leaving
i feel like they're deleting hate comments
Damn I thought he was leaving. How disappointing.
Thanks comment section. Just wanted to see if he was gone for good but ig not.
"theres no tea" everyones clicks off the vid 😂
"Oh no"   "Anyway"
"Sadly, there's no tea."  Seriously?   Thats a terrible way to live!  If you're "sad" there isn't tea, then you are the kind of person who brews your own.  That explains the clickbait titles I guess.
It’s about time
Finally
twitter.com/twitter
haha
I thought he was leaving youtube....goddammit
Funny dogs 🐩
♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
I haven't watched the full video but if he's actually leaving YouTube.....thank god finally!!

I thought he was leaving YouTube :(
Yeah delete yr channel
LETS FFUCKING GOOOOOOOOOO
You aren't a woman
Ur so gorgeous 😍
Haven’t watched you in over a year but I’m going to assume this title is as fake as Nick Avocado’s
I can’t be asked to watch this video is he leaving YouTube or not
Bye!
Literally no one cares you haven't been consistent on youtube in a long time and always have sorry excuses, just go already.   You only post when you want to clear your name on drama or when you want to sell makeup. .   Save the "goodbye" pity party for your mommy
That's cool and all, but did you know Eastern island heads have underground bodies? 🤯
Please leave lol
Hahaha finnaly
So when is the new closet tour jeffree Lynn? 😫
I don’t wanna see no red light
🥰
We asked about hair by jay not chris
Bye se ya never
Got my hopes up!! Thought you were saying good bye. Then nope its just you being "emotional" and talking all about yourself.
Why do you say sadly this is no drama like what we’re you wishing for there to be drama
you are to blame for shane's misfortune👎
Sorry guys I'm gonna ignore what happened to Shane and everything with James or whatever , anyways I'm rich and im still getting richer  I wanted to force my camera crew to come with me but  they have " lives " apparently , whatever🙄.         I'm joking btw lol don't take it to seriously
the gogs doin som behind u
That camera quality better than my eyesight
CLICK BAIT! 🤬
Lmao
Guys that's tough...guess how much I care 👀
I ❤  you... please do some research on the vaccine, do not do it...
FINELY
Going to look at Jeffree's first video....
Bye Sister!
why you leaving
lol
um bye lol
k goodbye
ok .-.
gayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
Calm down guys, he’s not actually Leaving!  A lot of youtubers say this, but they never leave!  See you on the next video Jeffree!
This guy is disgusting. I can’t believe people r like this
Thank god we wont have to see any of the cringe comments anymore
gayyyy
am I the only who thought he’s leaving YouTube 😭😭
Oh man, you are so brave for filming your own YouTube video. How did you manage to pull through? 🙄
why dont you ask Chris to recommend someone that he knows and trust
If there’s not the phrase: “the last couple of days/weeks/months/years has been crazy/a lot” then it’s not a Jeffree video
Finally something good happened today :)
https://youtu.be/95CasUjuZCM
why are you?
Never clicked so fast.
why aren't you in jail yet
When you see a video titled “Saying goodbye”, you always expect them to quit YouTube
Jeffree is trying to manipulate us AGAIN
жесть как я сюда попал
Peter Griffin: “Oh my god who the hell cares!”
When people say it’s hard to trust people but they are known to be untrustworthy. The irony is everything ☕️🫖🍵
Yayy u let ur dogs on the couch with u
Booyyyy we don’t care 😹
Jeffree: "Alot has been going on in my life"  Dogs: We are the alot going on
I saw the title and clicked straight away, I don’t even watch Jeff but I watched it all❤️
Jeffree: "there is alot of thing going on, and I wanna have a deep talk"  Dogs: "WELCOME TO WWE SMACKDOWN!!!"
thats kinda gay
Scrolling the comments and damn, some people really hate Jeffrey Star don’t they?  I don’t know how y’all have the energy to be so angry all the time, it’ so exhausting.
Got my hopes up for nothing
Leave YouTube please
k bye
Mans has said goodbye 50 times
Damn son why is everyone so mean to Jeffrey? He literally made himself from nothing and sure like everyone else he’s got good days and bad days. And if I came from eating funfetti icing to ballin in my Versace robe in my mansion I’d be about it too!
what is this thing with pink hair 🤢🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮
Damnit! I thought you were gonna fk off from YouTube But unfortunately we're not that lucky
5:53 not the pom falling 😭😭
Hahaha
Yeah I just go ahead and tell me does he mentioned the mystery boxes at all
Man i was about to start singing ding dong the witch is dead with my homies you telling me skelotor here is sticking around
His tone of voice is always so rehearsed and insincere.
KATASTROPHE, er braucht sehr viel Hilfe  !!!!!! 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤨🤨🤨🤨
I don’t want to watch any of the video, but I just wanted to comment that if you are leaving YouTube....        THANK YOU SO MUCH AND GTFO HERE!!!!!  BYEEEEEE
Jesus Is KING
What about a foundation!?? You need a foundation to go with the concealer!!
JEFREEE. LOVE THE BOWS 🎀🎀🎀🎀
Moves to LA stalking Jeffree (jokes) to get him to let me be the next chris lol
Omg imagine not having personal assistant and cameraman, how can anyone live like that? 😱
this seriously passed Rosé?
k
good riddance
chicken burgers are actually delicous try one to be happy
Anybody else hear the PS4 music playing the background 🤣🤣🤣
Bye ✌🏽
Everyone: 2020 was the WORST ever!  Me: 2020 wasn't that bad... I'm disabled and I don't normally go anywhere so nothing really changed other than I have to wear a mask. 2019 was a giant sack of sweaty balls (family getting in wrecks and dying or just dying in general). 2021? Looks like it could be much more of 2019 same... 😔
WAS KANYE GOOD
we won’t miss you
FINALLY LETS MAKE SOCIETY CLEANER!!!!
Bye.
For anyone thinking it’s Jefferson saying bye it’s not
Finally he’s gone
Love you always and forever 💕🧜🏼‍♀️👸🏻
THANK THE LORD 😅
If jefree didn't do the things in his past and recent allegations like him alot more if he'd stop lying. I used to think he was an amazing person ,but the truth comes out every time
hmmmmm ii smell a stunt
Lmao
#1 on trending. Safe to say we’ve missed you! 🖤
Yes finally, leave
Im only clicking the like bc i want him gone
Is he a catcher or pitcher ?
This is clickbait... I thought you were finally leaving youtube. I am beyond disappointed
im v disappointed rn... thought he was quitting youtube 😔
The Script A Mafia Story! Read The New Novel... It's A Movie For Your Mind.
NOBODY wants to be associated with Jeffree Star in 2021.  When you know better, you do better.
Your going break our 💙 and get away with murder.
Who else is happy
The video of him hopefully leaving gets the most views.  Imagine that
Video ends Me: wait what?..
Idon't normally comment. This is my first time but I had to say Jeff your dogs are lovely and you seem to be rather loving towards your pets. You seem to have a good heart.
Recap: Jeffery is NOT saying goodbye to YT. He’s saying goodbye to Chris (Jeffrey’s videographer). Saying goodbye to Madeline (assistant).
Bye Jaffa
Keep your face always toward the sunshine—and shadows will fall behind you.” —Walt Whitman
Finally, the camera won’t be all wobbling
Yay ur finally leaving
This is great
Is this actually trending, oh my,
Not the Alien lookalike from American Dad trending above Rose's Solo. This is a HATE CRIME 😨😨
yea
Yo, who wants eternal joy? Who wants unspeakable happiness? Peace like a river? Love like an ocean? Satisfaction? You can find all of that in JESUS, friends. Why not become saved?
I feel like this filming style could work for reviews and tutorials
aww shucks thought you were gonna be gone for good :(  edit: im reading these comments i- how- how do yall still support him? like- whats not making sense? i-
i was scared for a moment he was saying goodbye to youtube!!!
Just got this recommended for me
Just do it 🙃
LETS FUCKING GOOOOO
So ugly
Bye
YESSSSS
Hire me as your PA!
BYE
Bye see you never
Aww gonna miss Chris!
just clicked to watch the dogs tbhh
What the hell is even that?
Good, gtfo
this is number one on trending
So Gorgeous😍❤️
Close your clam bro ..your ball come out ....
Hello 💓
u said billion views your biggest video has 42 million viewers so.........?
Okay goodbye
Eww 🤮
Jeffree was cancelled last year.   He tried to hang around and stay relevant...but he'll always be the evil witch living all alone in his Pomeranian palace.  Bye Sister.
no one cares
What the fck is this and why is this on #23 in the German trends...
This guy is weird
I thought it was going to be a goodbye to youtube...now that would be a video worthy of a like. But sadly no.
Didn’t this guy Kanye’s pecker?
jeffrey: Saying Goodbye... youtube: let's make this #1 trending..
It will be different for sure. But I do hope you found the new people to fill in for those spots. Good luck Chris and Maddie. 💕
lol youre gay
Dangit thought he was actually leaving youtube
lol didn’t ask
Thank you
why the click bait 😫
What is this being? I wish my kids never know anybody like this. There is nothing right about this being.
The dogs will be leaving next cause even they can't take you anymore.
"I just got home from a crazy photoshoot, hence the hair and makeup."   Translation:  "Not enough people saw this look, so I have to film a video and pretend that it's a totally random coincidence that I'm "overboard-glam" right now.
Kinda wished he was leaving Social media
I'm trying to concentrate on Jeff but those precious babies have all my attention.
Not what I thought based on title.  I've been hornswoggled.
Long head make up wig wearing man Smfh
Bye
I would've preferred if YOU left.
He is so concerned about the pandemic he released cremated mocking it.
Maybe try doing it like everyone else and film your own stuff for a little while!!! It would feel more personal too😉
That’s how you know we are just views to him wow  I can’t believe this😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀
Goodbye
i Love those  dogzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
L
Thank god
First world problems.. so ridiculous
Hell yeah your leaving.. good I’m tired of seeing you on trending and showing kids that you exist. Everything about you is wrong and I wish YouTube would block people like you from our kids. Is very disrespectful and not right at all. I did not watch one second of this video. Just happy to see that you are leaving. 😇
To save yourself 11 minutes of your life he is saying goodbye to his staff not youtube
Wtf is this😂😂😂😂
I will serve you as your new PA.
Jeffree: sadly there’s no drama, no tea  Me: THATS WHAT I CAME HERE FORRRRRRR
I LOVE this video. Jeffree is so human in this. I’m impressed. He seems to be improving, and I’m here for it!
I don't watch this channel. But I hope Jeffree compensated Christian well. Since he was there's since the beginning, helped him set it up and stayed around loyally. My old boss wasn't a dick. But he screwed over most of us all left us high and dry after years. When his company went under. He stiffed a lot of us of commission.
Good
Thought he was saying goodbye....damn next time lmfao
Leave you gay
Waiting for my comment to get deleted
Nooooooo plzzzzz
https://youtu.be/_PUt6q8KRsE
I don’t even care but ok
We don’t fucking care go watch alpha betas @1pm on vanoss’s channel
🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄
I think this guy is cool
Let me be ur assistant. I have no life anyway as long as my dog can come
Hired
Ok.. bye...
So do you need a new assistant then? LOL I can send u my LinkedIn profile. I manage 800+ storage cubes, among other things. Hit me up. I don't mind living & breathing JStar cosmetics.
Why as this stupid crap come up
ok
Oh Jesus is this hell
So are you hiring?
What a huge blow to the community 😂
Chris and Maddie we will miss you dearly you amazing artists.😢❤️💔

please keep you and your family in Cali. we can't have freaks like you ruining the rest of normal America like in Wyoming
I bet Jeffery would think yall are trash IRL
Hahahahahaa!
What a freak
I want to be friends with Jeffree like so bad, just to hang out with him and talk life, simple stuff 🖤🥺
LETS GOOOOOOOO
🐕
Idk why I'm watching this. I think I'm still drunk from last night
I smelled cringe when I looked at the thumbnail.
Finally
FINALLYYY
“Ding dong the witch is dead!”
Finally, bye
omg i thought u were saying goodbye to youtube  gave me a  heart attack and goodbye i hope u find something good to do with ur life (to both of them)
Hire me. im 23, desperate and jobless. can work a camera, guess ill even paint shitty landscapes.
Who just wishes to go hevean if u do I do to who’s with me Jeffster I bet u wanted go to heaven to
BLESS THE GODS
Why is he always just naked in a bathrobe. Its disgusting
Act like. Man
Oh bye we won’t miss you
Jeffrey in his 859578391994772999164 million $ life SO MUCH HAS CHANGED AND MY LIFE IS HARRRRDDDD
The video title makes it seem like this is "Saying Goodbye to YouTube", or maybe a suicide message. People will worry when this kind of overboard, melodramatic phrasing is used. Could've said something about a camera man in the title, just sayin'; but, then, there would probably be a *lot* less views.
I thought he was gonna say goodbye to his gayness
Finally, inner peace
Needed some new attention so you clickbaited?
Dude looks like he’s been on meth for 10 years
People go, but how they left always stays. I know at this time it’s kinda hard without Maddie and Chris. But soon you’ll have someone like them. God made you strong and you deserved to be blessed and be a blessing. So it will come don’t worry. I’ll always pray for you ✨💖💕
*Jeffree saying is goodbyes*  Me eating tacos while watching: oh that sucks *skips video*    Edit: this is a joke, don’t worry guys
I wish there was more government funding counseling situations for people with his problem
I hope he actually says bye to hair by Jay
https://youtu.be/Xf6Geh82vXg
YESSS!!!!!!!!!!!!
I was thinking he was about to say goodbye to social media. Sadly, that day is yet to come.
Is Jeffree in heaven lmao! The background is so heaven like and the white couch haha
Bye
bye felicia
We love you unconditionally, Jeffree.
Oh. I thought this was the real goodbye? But... guess we're not there yet.
YAY we will get a review
He's finally leaving yt lol?? I havent started the vedio yet
LET GO I PRAY THE LORD I PRAY THE LORD
No one cares

Why do ppl watch this channel and why is it recommended
Is everything good HD focused in this video or what? It has better focus than the real world.
Leave YouTube
Thank god
Damnit, that title always tricks me.
Thank freaking god
I wish I could be your personal assistant!  I used to dream about being Martha Stewart's assistant 😄. These are big losses for you. I hope have time and space to honor your grief and I hope you find amazing new people to join your team. 💖💖💖💖💖
We all under stand your awesome this is really hard I know but things will get better I promise. We all love you jeffree I hope and I pray you find someone as AMAZING as criss, and just know I am praying for you, and we all love you. :)
aww if only you were leaving the internet
Smart people....run away from jeffree as fast as possible.
Damn! And I was really hoping he was leaving YouTube so I don’t have to hear about his toxicity And see his attention seeking thumbnails anymore. 🙁
Sooo you’re looking for a personal assistant? Because for real, 🙋🏼‍♀️!
Also the world looks more and more like the hunger games everyday
CLICKBAIT QUEEN "Hey evereyone... How are ya? Today it's time to say goodbye..." am i the only one thinkin he was leaving youtube???
Sorry guys but this video isn’t about jeffree quitting YouTube. We’ll get em next time boys.
I don’t care
This is gay as hell
The poms are your kids?☺
Every day you find a way to get uglier, when I thought it wasn’t possible anymore.
Oof, that's rough.

Clickbait
Congratulations Chris good luck on your next adventure!!! And the poms are amazing!!! 😍
“For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature: And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet. And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient;” ‭‭Romans‬ ‭1:26-28‬ ‭KJV‬‬
Thank god bye no ones gonna miss you
Ew
Thought was gonna get angry that this is #1 and Rosé is #2, but cried
i am sad... that he just looks sad.
Can we have anyone else on trending? I'll watch a cow eat grass if they make it trend number one.
This video is on 240p and it still looks MAGNIFIQUE 👉🌟
finally yes
Thank you ur finally gone
Bye
And now we have proof that rich dogs behave just like good old poor doggos.  All dogs are good crazy boys 🐶
When you have faith and confidence within yourself, nothing can put you down, even after one leaves. Be strong and move up like a star! Wishing you all the very best.. Jefree. Stay blessed
I wish people ATLEAST once respect Chris and don't spam negative things
You can tell all the negative comments are being deleted
Aw. Good luck to all of them! The videos aren’t bad. But you can notice a difference. Big hug thanks for sharing!

Thanks for leaving jeffree ha
I saw the title and immediately clicked on it 👁👄👁?
Loving the puppies Jeffree they are so cute plus I am definitely going to miss u so much on YouTube despite the drama 🎭
✨when someone has control of your mind they have control of your emotions...how you view the world, yourself & others…do not absorb react or respond to abusive personalities…there’s nothing more peaceful than connecting with your own soul, it’s the most powerful relationship you will ever have

Hi
Lol bye
Clickbait af, his assistant and videographer were fired
JESUS CHRIST IS KING 👑
LETS GOOOOOO
Not so crazy everyone in his life leave 🙄
I hate how people want to flip things into drama. I wish people would just stop and be more respectful to eachother. It’s not hard to keep things to yourself then being hateful on the internet! Stay strong mamas you will find people to fill those positions when the time comes! Love you so much! 💕🥰
Nut job
only sheep care about rich people
I am happy that this is not an advertising video but Jeffree being humble and natural, I wish Jeffree has a good redeemed life and people accept it
So this is why Rosè is not first on trending??
Ohhhhhh those  buns love it 😍
You are strong🌟
I love all your pomeranian babies in the background
I know you'll be blessed with whoever comes into your life.
Those beautiful furbabies 🥰

🙄 You aren’t relatable. Stop blaming your shitty behavior on things that have nothing to do with who you truly are. You are not a victim.

Wow
Clout is one hell of a drug😒.
Who is this person? I’m not into drama
Came to dislike
You know he's not serious because he isn't posed like a dead corpse wearing overpriced clothes, on a overpriced couch
Is he gay?
This 62 years young woman adores you! You are so brave and beautiful.
Oof
Black people are magic 👑✊🏾✨
2021 is really a tuff year for you
Love you Jeffree

Uh the versace dressing gown, I've been after one for a while 😍
Don't get cancelled please stay making lovely videos Jeffree .
Bitch I'm Strong love it
I would love a reality show of Jeffrey totally watch it 😉
She has definitely murdered someone
Are you hiring for an assistant?
He’s such an awful person in real life
Can’t wait to see what the future holds for you ❤️
Well Kris Jenner is free now her kids deserted her from Keeping up with the Kardashian’s, maybe she has time to be your personal assistant
Who is this?       WHY IS THIS IN MY RECOMMEND!
🤮🤮😳
I'm so happy for Christian, but he'll be missed by all of us.
I fell scare when read seeing goodbye video I expected Jeffrey a decision stop her career I fell shock love you Jeffrey
I would let jeffree hit me with his pink cars if I meant I got to be his personal assistant. I already live and breathe jeffree.  Side note: so sad to see chris and maddie go. I will miss their laughter and silliness they had with Jeffree
What a shame, I was hoping he was going to quite YouTube forever :(
Maddie is moving on too??? Aww, she will be missed! Wishing everyone the best!!
Love you Jeffree
Just believe in GOD
Who cares.
Only Jesus can save your soul man you just have to pray jeffree dont stop praying to Jesus Jefree
Damn. Love the video. I miss will miss them tho. It won’t be the same without them.
Praying for you Jeffrey. Slay always. Godbless you 😘
I love this sit down video. To me, this is as real as you have been in a while. It’s always glam and noise but this was calming and more real. The pups are getting so big. I’m sorry to hear about your “family” leaving. I hope you find trustworthy people to fill their shoes. 💜💜 much love to you!!
I’ll work for u, boo! Lol
Praying for you jeffery. Love u
bye bye !!!
https://youtu.be/PUBiit-Wlv0
dear jeffree , just tell me an email to forward my CV and call me right away for a job interview!!!!!!
i just can't care anymore, sorry. the over the top lifestyle just really lost its appeal after last year. find it hard to enjoy this whole schtick anymore. glhf
I’m not the biggest fan of Jeffree, but gosh he’s entertaining to watch. Especially when it’s just him sitting and talking.. the story he’s telling doesn’t get boring. Just get so into it all the time.... Dammit lol
Two massive estates to live in basically by yourself. Glad the dogs are around.
Jeffrey, lead your life  with a GOOD 💗!  It will make your life (and others) so much better.  I wish you the best!
And we miss Jeffree in love...
Where can I send my CV? I would like to become your assistant.
best thing that happened today
Omg the dogs 😭🥰😍
Absolutely understand, we just miss 2018/19 Jeffree Star (he/she/they need to come back soon) 🥺❤️
Say goodbye to your hair dresser because you hold yourself and the people around you accountable ... right
2021 already told 2020 to hold its white claw and vape pen.
Jeffree if you want a down to earth girl from Minnesota to be your personal assistant let me know 😉☀️
Michael Jackson called...He wants his nose back.
DONT TAKE VACCINES
I’m so sorry jeffree!! Things will get better. I’ll be your assistant lol 😂❤️
I would love to be your personal assistant! 💖
I will miss your video...i watch you for 4 years now.
Jeffree star be like poopenfarten
who else though jeffree was leaving 👋🏻 just me??? \/
Before the video starts your hair is soooooooooooo cuteeeee
Trying to focus and listen but that naughty baby wolf bear is distracting me! We need a pupdate.
If you are not going to be accountable for your actions/the actions of your brand PLUS holding your employees accountable then you don’t deserve this platform ✌🏼BYE
Absolutely irreplaceable. Good luck to them both - they will do amazing things! I’m sure this is difficult and you will find just as good people to surround yourself with. Don’t say yes to yes people! We 💖 you!
Haha I think I watched Donatella the whole time 😂
you and your viewers are human toilets no matter how much work you get on it.
If you didn’t live in California you could enjoy life like the people in Florida and Texas.
Never in my life clicked so fast
Did you say goodbye to your nail person as well? 💅🏻?? C & M will both be missed. 🌟
https://youtu.be/eWWXNHqzz2c

Everyone is moving on from Jeffree just because how toxic he is
Let me be your camera woman!! 21 years old! I’ve been in photography and Adobe certified since 2014!!! 💜✨💜✨
Girl, hire me. I’ll let your subscribers read me for filth for 6-figures a year. I’m open to negotiating though 😂. Let me know, Sis!
wagwan my g
Please don’t 🥺♥️
We're proud of you, Jeffree!  ❤ And goodluck to both Chris and Maddie Lynn.  Hugssssss
clickbait
I hope someone makes a video over all this so I don't have to watch this all the way through
Stay strong queen, we love you and know you will get through this and whoever ends up your videoagrapher and PA will be so damn lucky and hope they will be grateful for the amazing opportunity you will be giving them  ❤️💜💖
Only a 12 min video? Jeez
Jeffree: "A lot has been going on in my life"  Dogs: We are the a lot going on     Edited cause you are all picky lol. Let's just enjoy my boring ass comment.
hello everyone, have a great weekend. xoxo princess
Oh no.... anyway
i don't watch his videos but yeah, leave already
How does someone in your income bracket trust a new person in your life??? I'd be a paranoid freak
Umm bye? Whoever you are..
You got this girl!!! I believe in you!!!! ❤❤❤❤❤
Bye 😂
Whoever joins your team Jeffree they will be very lucky to be working with you. Sending love from the UK 😘
I feel you girl, I just had to get rid of my cooker in the kitchen that hasn't worked in 2 years....  Edit... Also still trying to employ an assistant after advertising the last 4 years..... We're the same you and I.
Seems a hair out of touch - no?
I love watching the dogs goofing around behind Jeffree
Aaaaand there go the last people in his life. Now he's truly alone. At least he has those dogs.
Od drop everything to be ur manager. But i have a daughter that my life revolves around. Can she come lol
Jeffree: makes a video trying to say goodbye to his team People : Jeffree is quitting YouTube
Dont slam the door on your way out.
I support you always!!!
Im trying to pay attention but I’m more focused on the dogs playing and biting each other😂😂😂😂
What are you?
Wtf have I just clicked on
i think we should stop acting like we know celebs and famous people. we don’t know who this guy is l0l
I can guarantee my comment will get deleted but good riddance. He is fake and is only interested in clout chasing.   Next up the d'amelio sisters..
Don’t take the vaccine!!
Arrgh... I see what he did here.. The dogs were placed there strategically to keep it light hearted and bearable! ☺️🌙 New Moon in Pisces Wooooo!! 😭😭😭😭😭😭
Who the heck does this nub have 16 mil subs
Dont u even do it jeffree no dont leave!! Havent watched yet but im crying already!!!
we love you Chris! thank you 🤗 thank you Maddie 🤗
don't you guys realise that this vaccine is not good for you? especially americans, don't you have this opioid-crisis, which proofes that the pharma-industry might not be the most trustworthy..... so don't you just get it? probably a waste of time to state this here.
Everyone around me taking the vaccine didn’t make me think twice about taking it... but jeffree taking it makes me think maybe it’s less likely the vaccine flops, cuz probably he has smart advisors and such.
not me just looking at the dogs fighting and not paying attention to what he is saying
Love you 🙏🏼🥰
Hey how about Andrew?  He would be perfect to film your videos.
Jeffree you will get through this...love good luck on your vaccine im taking mine next week...Maddie and Chris will be missed...Jeffree you be that boss bitch and kick ass and take names !!
Oh how disappointing..I thought you were going to disappear.
I feel this video on such a deep personal level. I have had to say goodbye to soo many people that decided to move to be closer to their loved ones bc of the pandemic and it's just been an emotional rollercoaster of a year.
Why are you dressed like a drag queen
I bet someone is going to start Drama when there is none
But not saying goodbye to disgusting bullies like Jay!?
He’s talking like these people are dead.. no they just don’t work for you anymore 🙄
Good luck Jeffree!
Im sorry Jeffrey.... But i can't listen to what your saying. Because of the fur babies playing on the sofa next to you... Soooo adorable.. 😍
Byeeeee
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
am i the only one who noticed how he spelt 'evereyone' instead of everyone in the desc💀
I am so sorry but Chris will be missed, but I WAS SO SCARED THINKING YOU WERE QUICKING YOUTUBE JEFFREE!!!! So thank god that you are not leaving us........love ya Jeffree!!!!!💗💗💗💗💗  Also dying for your hair.......absolutely love the pink bows and how the colors match and mixed up!!!! 🎀🎀🎀🎀🎀
#JeffreeStar good luck on all you do.  Blessing to you.
Happy for them and this is time for inner peace and relaxation for you. Live more simple for now
Jeffree I’m sure you read the comments. But now that you’re flying solo, maybe you could find some time to comment back it would be awesome. Thank you. Like Ali Butterfield has an awesome palette idea for you 💜
This weird
sus
We Love Chris, Maddie, and You So Much, and we Hope that they do Phenomenally in the next chapter of their lives! 💜💜💜 😘
I love your hair
i love you
Loving the hair
Okay but to be your camera woman or assistant 😭😭
He’s so honest and open here. ❤️❤️
Is anyone else dying to know what Jeffree got them for a farewell gift? 😭😭😭
Goodbye
jeffree was right all along tho 🤷🏻‍♂️
You can do it boo xx 😘💪🏼 stay strong . I wish I could come film for you if I was more experienced . You could trust me to the moon and back, I’m too loyal , but that’s how it should be , I know what it’s like to get hurt by people you open up to. I wish you the best of luck in you finding someone worthy to be there. Lots of love x
You got this perfection takes time
Behold, a monster
ok bye
you need a friend in your life jeffrey
I really hope he finds the best people to replace them. I’m hoping the humbleness we see in this video really is a start in the right direction, the best direction for the future Jeffree. Someone who has grown and learned from all the drama from the last few years. I do feel that his makeup products are literally the best in the business. I love that about him. Quality has to be the best with an affordable price point. I miss the YouTube videos. Hopefully he has put all the BS behind him. For the people that continuously feel that he has to apologize a thousand times for the same sh**, grow up.
His nose looks so tiny now.    Nostrils are paper thin !   I think I know what JS did during the lockdown .
I'm here Jeff you are gonna be ok
I love you so much! You’re amazing Jeffrey stay strong!!!
Look at the sweethearts
Is there a mascara that you would recommend. I'm looking for waterproof, smugproof and non clumping
You so awesome .......
Nice shout out to Casper Wyoming yay bitch
I love his poms 🥺🙌♥️ ( i really want a pomeranian ) also haven’t seen Jeffree for ages
I hope this works out
Prayers
No one:....  All emotional videos... Put camera on the stand as if they just started recording. 😒
Andrew shloud be his next video guy !!!!!!!!
I don't even know who this person is. It just popped up in my feed. 16mil subs and still yea never heard ov jeff
Poms took the show lol love watching the poms playing ,, poms playing like this is adorable 🥰 my 2 poms do this a lot makes me laugh so sweet bless them Hugs little sweethearts 🐾 🐾 💞
I love and support you Jeffree. I wish I could help out in some way! But you got this! Prayers and lots of love!
Ok
Wish you would say goodbye to hair by Jay 🤡🤡🤡
Maddie has been gone for a while. Bish needs to say goodbye to his asshole hair guy too.
Bye we wont miss ya
Love ya!!! And you look gorgeous, loving the hair
ok bye
Chris is super talented and we can't wait to see where he goes from here! Hoping you find someone to work with that you love and vibe with, just as much as Chris! Letting go and saying goodbye...moving on is healthy babes! ❤
Stay strong! People come and go in life, but the most important thing is to not lose yourself.        Love you Jeffree ⭐️ 😘
Hope u find someone else to trust hope everything goes well
Every video: "I have never done this before"
I saw the title and clicked straight away, I don’t even watch Jeff but I watched it all❤️
Bye, definitely not gonna miss you 👋
Personal assistant is like another dog ? Im out ;)
This kinda just sounds like a good excuse for I don’t film videos unless I have a product coming out
Love you Jeffree. You’re amazing 🥰😘
This must be hard, but Jeffree  is a professional, wish u the best! Change is hard but cheers to new opportunities, u got this boo. ♥️😘🙏🏼
Haha
The babies keep looking at you. Too cute!!
I just ordered the chipotle palette! I can’t to see what you think!
All i can concentrate on is the lil doggies play fighting 😂😂😂😂😍😍😍😍
sorry jeffrey, your camera quality is so crisp I been staring at it the whole video.
we're gonna miss you Chris ❤️
*bye.*
So dramatic Americans
Sym
Haven't seen Diva in a while I hope he is OK  Much much love
Does anyone know what camera he's using?🙄
I really hope Jeffree   finds true happiness, god bless him 💋💄💕🥰🥰
So no rectal cancer
Me: *trying to watch this video* Also me: *watching the dogs in the background fight and play with a blanket*
Poor Jeffery   He’s had a hard year
ugly
a jeffree video with over 1 million views that only has 11k comments?? they're definitely removing some.
Jeffree you’re a Big ~girl, get back on the horse.. good ppl are only in our lives for a moment & the bad ones just don’t leave soon enough. Hang in .. looking forward to your best to come ✌️💜🙏🏼
Clikbait
K, bye 👋🏽
Ah,the reliable clickbait 😒
Seen post on instagram and ran to youtube 🏃‍♀️🏃‍♀️🏃‍♀️🏃‍♀️
4:20 just watch the newest baby for like a minute 😂
I love your energy and your story from the beginning.  You are such a sweetheart, from one Scorpio to another I know you will master this transformation 😘
Is anyone else still looking forward to ‘Jeffree Skin’? I sure am!!!!
Sounds like he farted in the very beginning lol
Bye lol
I volunteer as a personal assistant 😭
Awww that music at the end 😭😭😭😭
okay but how can i apply to be your new personal assistant 🥺🥺 (please a girl needs a new purpose)
JEEFFREEE GONE!
covid gone
cars gone
dogs gone
house gone
boyfriend gone
Maybe a montage of the best Chris moments!? Id love it!
Me: high af distracted by the baby playing in the blanket
damn I was hoping this video was going somewhere else
L
jeffree is a terrible nasty person. why do you all keep watching and ignoring that very clear reality? yuck. bye jeffree 😷😒
God closes some doors so he can open new and better ones..it will be ok❤
BYE SISTER
If I was your assistant you would just have to be worried of finding me on the floor rolling with the dogs, yelling they are so adorable or tanking them to sleep with me at night😂❤️. I love animals and your little baby clouds are so adorable 🥰.  I hope you find the people you need 😊❤️.
Everyone is jumping ship
Fucking finally
Love you Jeffrey stay stong
Jeffree I can be your new personal assistant
Respect for Jeffree 📈📈📈📈
The most important thing in here is that y'all safe. I love you, Jeffree!!! ❤️ We really can't stop change, so let's all be strong for each other. ❤️
“I know y’all think I only upload to promote products”  “Oh and keep your eye out for my new mascara this week maybe (;”
You did good recording this video sis!!
It must be so hard 😫  to lose 2 people in his life like that. But I wish them both the best of luck with their lives! And Jeffee Star i hope you find others that can be as important in your life as Chris and Maddie Lynn were! Wishing you guys all the best!! Xxxx
Before I see this good byeeeeee
I wish you the best with this. Like you said the right people will come. Even though it’s beautiful to see others start new chapters it’s always a lil sad to see an old chapter close.
Like catching AIDS digitally.
I love you jeffree!
Was this recorded with a phone from 2006???
Well I guess that clears up all the “tea” thank God he came out and told us the truth I’m so sick of all the speculations. Video quality is Superb! Now I just need Ms Jeffree Lynn Pom Mom to come out with a Signature Fragrance Already!!!! I’ve been telling him for 4 years now. I’ve designed the  bottle for Heaven sake. Who doesn’t want to know what that perfume would be like. Jeffree it’s Perfume Time 💜💜💜
Yall.. title was so dramatic.. talking about pandemic, then saying theres a lot going on, “saying goodbye”, yall really had me thinking Chris died😐
Came here to see if he was actually leaving YouTube, now I’m going to clear my history.
First 10 secs was like a vlog
I’m only here for the dogs
Disgusting
I love your FACE
no matter what dramas u've been into,we still love u.
PLEASE DO MIXING ALL MY LIPSTICK/EYESHADOW TOGETHER!!!!
omg hire me 🥺 haha
Jeffree such a tough loss but I know you will find some great new people! Stay strong queen!
Hi Jeffery I’m here to say I’m the one you can trust I can meet you at your place I have , no skills other than creative things BUT... I can fill a space with laughs so Pick Me . Choose Me - I’m thinking smoke a bowl on the way to get Taco Bell
U know u are special to Jeffree and a dear friend when he makes a whole video just for u ... Bet Chris gonna love this video... Wish him the best and hopefully he moves on up I'm sure Jeffree is more than grateful for creating so many memories and working so close with him because I know it was his job but it was much more than that, can't help but to become friends with the people that u work with specially when they are such nice humble people like Chris...
Poor jeffree tho 🥺❤️
boring
Why not Andrew? You guys got on really well
Stay strong Jeffrey we're here for u don't worry take care baby ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️. Ily❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
California is doing it better than Maine. I’m an essential worker and haven’t get the vaccine until July because they switched the requirements to age based. I’ve worked my ass off for this state through a pandemic even though my whole family it high risk. I’ve never been more pissed at this state. On a better note, I’m glad to see you back and that there is no drama. I don’t think people making up lies realize that the people in your life were there for a really long time and they can’t actually stay forever.
just read the title - shes leaving youtube? W
THE ONLY THING MISSING IS THE ICONIC GOLD COUCH....😁🤣 nothing but 💜🖤💜
you make me sick
😭😭🥴🥴💩💩
Love you Maddie Lynn! Best wishes and best of luck! Wish nothing but the best!!💛💛💛💛💛💛💛
I'm so sorry about Chris. You look beautiful! The dogs are everything. Be strong...
i— i thought he’s going to leave yt. i was about to celebrate.
Very kind words for your videographer and personal assistant! These are huge changes, yes! It will be hard to fill such important roles in your life and your business. You have so much to say and share, we all wish you the best in finding the best people for the next chapters of your amazing life!
LMFAO THE THUMB NAIL I  CANNOT PLZ HAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHHA
I am so sorry in advance but i thought you had bacon rolls on your head! Can’t unsee it!!
Biggest click bait
goodbye
How many of ya'll wudda rode to the end and got the gold watch and retired with Jeff?
YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEES
address it i dont care about your personal life we care about what you have done online
you got this,girl!! this is also the next chapter in your life too--- best wishes to Chris and Maddy!!
Shame I loved Christian
I am glad you are letting off everything, from a mental standpoint it's healthy.
can we just talk about how angelic the background is
U look cute
Omg Jeffery is GORGEOUS!
Camera guy....GONE Personal assistant.... GONE
I volunteer as tribute, lol. I would move my lil ass to California and and and Hi 👋... haha
LMAOOOOOO
I'm trying to pay attention to Jeffree but my eyes keep drawing to his hair and dogs 🤩
I think this is wonderful!  People don't see their daily importance or impact on others lives and I love that you made a video to show your love for your friend.  I love that you did this to show your appreciation for the people who have worked with you.  I hope more people do this
Take a shot every time Jeffery says "hugh".
Goodbye then
Who else miss the Jeffree, Laura, and Manny days.
Hope the title is true
5:49 *BONK* poor dessert lol
I myself was in a position of living in a foreigh country and wasn't able to see my family all year, so I genuielly underestand the struggle. Life is hard and making your own decisions is even harder. Memories are the most prescious things in life ♥
The sad part is that people around you/us are ready to move on to the next chapter of their life and you just left there hanging. It's life, people come and go.

Is the intro his version of a vlog?
We will miss Chris!
When you call yourself out in your own video lol 8:20
We need more vlogs ...jeffree will resurrect vlogging 🎥
Oh youre not actually leaving youtube forever? Rip. Thought this trash would finally be gone.
Deja el drama y busca alguien más que hay muchos más profesionales y además buscando trabajo,  eso si , respeto ante todo saludos mi jefffff
Good
Get off of the internet already
Warning with the vaccine I got mine yesterday and got so sick didn't even get to watch this video last night.

FINALLY!! I'M SO HAPPY WITH HIM LEAVING!!
No offense but...            *I dont even know who you are*
I'm black and roll hard for Jeffree!
Love you jeffree lyn ⭐️ everything will fall back into place for you and you will be there happy again ❤️❤️❤️❤️
U had me scared after u said Christian!
It’s ok Jstar we are here for the ride
nobody cares good riddance
CLICKBAIT
Hiii
Am I like the only one who read the click bate title thinking he is fucking taking accountability and leaving y.t to have this shit show of a video appear....like no thank you sir....just keep denying and shifting blame or out right ignoring it....since you came to our community it has become a toxic place...that is in part mostly because of you in some way or form....gtfo bye sis....
Good luck to you Christian for yr future
I wish I lived closer.  I would be happy to help 😊
Heeeey Jeffree! 😂
I am crying
‘sadly there’s no tea’  me: 🚶🏻‍♀️🚶🏻‍♀️🚶🏻‍♀️🚶🏻‍♀️🚶🏻‍♀️
No one cares apart from his fans😂
*We will miss Chris, but we hope you find someone to fill his huge shoes.*
Ok but why did you and Maddie stop following each other online if all is good between you?. I'm genuinely curious? No shade. Just curious.
Awww that’s sad
Rancid
He is used to averaging 15 million views & now 1 million, so I presume Jeff thought time to downsize.  Nobody wants to go back to England. It's worse there than in US. So I doubt that storyline.
I would literally die to be your personal assistant but I live in New York🥺 I’m 19 my name is Angela Mariani and I’m currently a freshman second semester college student and I’m super tired of my major. Being your assistant would make me have a purpose in life because I feel so helpless and a burden to everyone around me, I need change!❤️
I love these type of videos. Not having to promote anything, just real talk. It's like having quality time with a friend.
Dont give up jeffree you can do it.
Jeffree youre so pretty
I’m gonna miss the “chris how are we feeling what do we think?” :(
Loved this!!
🖤🖤🖤🖤
3 cats the 3 musketeers lol
Bruh
Why did I think that he was leaving YouTube for a sec 😭😂
Didn’t ask.
I love you Jeffree. And I'm praying for you.
this is literally the first time i’ve felt jeffree star has been genuine and himself in one of these «serious» videos
:(
who are you
Omg we’ll miss you maddie 💓💓🥺
I'm happy u r happy for them. It's important that they can develop as well and after 5 yrs it's very common to move on.
I came here hoping he quit youtube
I appreciate U, but so many of Ur previous friends have painted a picture of U that Ur The Evil 👑.. $ can change people... I would like to believe this isn't true n their just Jelli....
Bye
this guy has been blocking some comments me thinks
Looking forward to your new creations this year, would be awesome to have all metalics eyeshadow palette 💖 liquid liners too 😁🤞 or /and do 4 seasons palettes, yes, that would be awesome 😁💖😍
Who’s listening but watching the dogs
I thought he was gonna say the guy died or something??
I’m so sorry but your dogs have gained my full attention during this video.
I just cant hold back my tears since ive watched this...Im sorry.
Sending love x thanks Chris and Maddie for your amazing work 💗
I’m not trying to sound inconsiderate but you talking about how it’s SO difficult because you can’t travel back & forth as well as have meet and greets hits me the wrong way. Some of us are struggling to figure out how we are going to pay the bills and put food on the table since this all started .
Will miss Chris! “Always down for the cause” I know that’s right! Please take time to find the right person, going to be hard, he’s irreplaceable, as ya just said. love ya Chris! Love ya jeffree Lynn ! Love you pumpkins (the dogs)
No bad blood but Maddison and Jeffree no longer follow each other on the Gram
am I the only who thought he’s leaving YouTube 😭😭
By guy kid
I thought Jeffrey star was leaveing..what a shame 😒
I love you Jeffrey. We understand.
wtf is on my screen
deserved we wanted u to leave
Love from india.
I hoped it was him who would leave smh
Everyone’s left you. Take a look at why girl. Do some soul searching.
I call my poms bears too!  💖 I bought one of your skin frost palettes and just got it in the mail the other day and OMG its BEAUTIFUL!  Love it. Hope you have a good day.
Before I use to think everyone was being dramatic about him but at this point I feel like he is the problem now...
HIRE ME FOR PERSONAL ASSISTANT TY
If u rescue me from Bolsonaro I will be your little bitch 4everrrrrrrr ❤️❤️❤️
I love you JEFFREE DONT YOU LEAVE ME !!!!!!!
We need a frenemies podcast on what the real tea is that two of your closest employees left you
Christian would never allow that up-robe shot.
Me clicking on this video so fast  thinking Jeffery was announcing that he is quitting YouTube 👁👄👁
I’m a 18 year old from England and I’m just about to finish high school, life has been messed up from covid and my schedule is free- I have a passport and Jeffrey I’m ready for you to hire me as your new personal assistant ❤️
Be gone
Gbye
Adios, amigo!
Has a kardasian sayed " there ppl dying"
I vote Andrew for your new camera guy!!
Weird how im not seeing any negativity in this comment section. Are we still ignoring that jeffree is a piece of shit?
GIRRRRRLLLL , I’ll come be your personal assistant LIKE YESSSSS
Thank you for blessing us with an 11min pup video 🥰
Thank fuck
WHAT IS THIS FREAK
Ytr tge
Jeffrey all calm and collect... dogs be like.. SMACKDOWN!!!
How I know I’m an  NYC/LA b*tch I look at fashion in everything I watch including YouTube and TV shows
Battyboi!!!!
I will miss Chris! I do wish him the best! Hang in there Jeffree, you got this!
"2021 girl.. hope ur a little more UNFORGIVING than last year" ?!?!?! Jeffree wants us all to burn, confirmed LMAO 9:12
The fuck.
Go Away
I also can’t believe no one pointing out the fact that y’all cancelled him over the James charles shit when he was right. And no one IS TALKING ABOUT IT
Omg noooo! Im gonna miss maddie and kris 😢💕
Jeffree...loyal fan since 2005 here...I got your back. Need a crew? Call your fans who love you!
As I am sad to see Chris leave, I am really relieved to know it isn’t Jeffree leaving
Stfu please
me seeing the title: hysterically wheezing for about 10 minutes  NOT YALL ATTACKING ME FOR LAUGHING AT A MAN WHO GETS CANCELLED EVERY WEEK
Freak get off YouTube
CHRIS DID US SO WELL 😭❤️ Good luck Chris, we are going to miss you!
Good riddance to bad rubbish. Byeeee
❤❤❤
Love you Jeffree!
what are you
Smacks to me of folks leaving a sinking ship. Grab on to the nearest life belt.
The moment you set up your own camera I know Chris is a “bye-bye” 🥺
Prayers for u Jeffree star and I truly believe god made room for your new circle to form for your new chapter as well✨👌🏽🙏
Why not have Shane Dawson film you he's grat
I couldn’t imagine being in your position. People can be so shady. I hope it’s a stress free process for you.
Why are you playing piano music in the background though while the sun in shining behind you? It’s like you are trying to subliminally frame the audience to believe you are being positive??
I was so scared you were gonna quit by The title, thank god not!
Give Shane Dawson the job at least he will have one
I love you Jeffere ❤😘🤩🤗🤗🤗
*He always has been a weird person to me, turns out I was only judging him on the basis of his looks. I believe sometimes he has been AWFUL on the Internet but no one really had the BIG reason of hating him*
Cl.ick.ba.it at is best... typical primitive youtuber, again... same as the others
These type of people are just gross, look at the way he moves and talks, Yikes
I have watched you for a long time Jeffree.  Take some time to do things right.  You don't owe anyone anything.  Take care of you.  This has been a hard year on all of us.  You are not alone.
Love you always jefree 😥😥
This look really has you and bella thorne looking alike 😂 sending love boo ❤️
Off topic, but was it achelasia you had? Can you give us some more insight? More details on how you work through it? I have achelasia and I'm currently waiting on another surgeon to call me...meanwhile I can't swallow anything!
L
Dane Shawson is terrified by the title of another Jeffree Star Vid.
Never clicked so fast. completely!
So nice to see Jeffree just sitting down and being real just talking again
I just watch those dogs 😍
where the hell did i just drop into! what is this!is this what u people do.. man fix yourself up your a mess! tattoo's are earned in tribal war u wear them like jewelry.... no idea....god save us cause the govt aint
Only reason this is number 1 on trending is because people hoped he was leaving the the Internet 🤔
❤❤❤❤
When you can’t apply to be Jeffree’s PA 😩😩😩
"There is no gossip, no drama"  *me closing the video
Was hoping he was finally leaving YouTube after being called out for all horrible things he has done.
I don't get why he feels the need to do this kind of video every once in a while... making it seems like he's humble and genuinely cares about not just selling his next palette or product
Good work girl you slay!! Xxxz
I'll always be a supportive fan no matter what you're one of my inspiration in doing make up
I'll always be a supportive fan no matter what you're one of my inspiration in doing make up
Been a fan been here since day 1, actually since Bebo days !!! Those sound clips on Bebo and Myspace candy and cereal pics Jeffrey!!!
should have said goodbye to hair by jay
Take me as new personal assistant or camera man 😂 I’m from Belgium , 24y  😁
Omg that “DEAR DALIA” makeup ad can u say THIEF!!! They legit straight stole FENTY’s Look
Take the time you need Jeffree. Don’t stress yourself so much❤️
Guys please. Don’t forget all the fucked up shit he did!!!!!!!! This is what he wants!!!!!!!!!!!
I am happy for your team, and pray that their next chapters are full of love and positivity. I love you for sharing this with us. It's great to see you are doing OK (for the most part). Just enjoy your time off, breath, and continue to manifest positivity. Everything will fall in line perfectly. Sending (only) good vibes your way. 💙
I hear Shane needs a job
who asked
I thought he was quitting! Im glad he isn’t but I will miss Chris soooooooo much😭
You are such a strong person. I know you will make it. I will pray for you sweetheart!!!
Its gonna be hard and take a long time for the new people to settle their new position. Its gonna be a mess here and there but hey, its part of the learning and eventually, ull get used to it
sis, stop with the comment moderation, it ain't cute.
I live for Jeffree ❤️❤️❤️ he’s so cute like that being real missed him
Bitch what
Please come see me in Casper iv been dying to see u!!!! And hope u open a factory here and girl I'm just so happy ur in Wyoming part time!!!!
*virtual hugs Jeffree*
🙏🏼🍀🍀💚🍀🍀🙏🏼
i noticed that the dog on the left is chill af
Sending everyone good vibes, may your life be prosperous and full of positivity ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I love you! 💕💕💕
I thought he was bout to say goodbye to YouTube.
But no traveling has been good for the environment.
I knew maddy just left on good terms, I thought it was to start a family lol but definitely on good terms, sad Chris has left but I can understand its hard being away from his family, I've not seen my nan in over a year thanks to covid and its been though, hopefully you get a new videographer that's nearly as good as Chris 💜
If there’s no tea why Jeffree and Christian didn’t film the last video together?
Hi Jeffree!hi Bear babies🐶🐕🐶🐕🐶Saying Goodbye is never easy!It's sad😢Chris be blessed and happy!💟💔💜💝💘💗
God Bless You Dear
What about Andrew?
Clearly he has never been honest with himself let alone anyone else such clickbait he will litterly do anything to sell his crapy overpriced cosmetics if you can call them that besides according to everything going around online his personal assistant left because she saw everything from him paying people off to being the most manipulative person alive she couldnt handle the toxicity of having him in her life and shouldnt have to go peddle your sob story to someone else to sell your overpriced bs
Straight up i WAS A FAN OF JSC but he gets away with so much. He puts on a sad act and people justify his actions. He says he’s working on himself but he does the same shit over and over again.he is rich to the point where he gives no shits about anyone. He has messed with people’s lives and all he got were “hate comments” and tweets. I know this comment won’t go far but if you agree with me 👍 this comment.
WE WANT TO SEE CHRIS!!
This is so weird, the other day I was thinking about my life & how I wanna do certain things. For some reason that led to me thinking about Maddy being your assistant for so long & I thought about how happy it made me that Jeffrees always had someone there for him. I’m sad to see her go, but wish all of you the best 💕
I love this tipe of Videos . You go girl
Best wishes to Jeffree, Maddie And Chris ♥️♥️
I am going outside for a walk. The people cannot be arsed with all of this immature nonsense. It is all so boring. The global pandemic has shifted the peoples toleration level. Loss of income has contributed to the change of behaviour by many young adults. Escapism activities have shifted. All this fake arsed drama is becoming less of an entertainment and more of a complete bore. Showing off your riches is getting up the peoples noses. People are dying, starving, struggling. Mental health issues are at an all time high. The kids need to be outside at one with nature to heal and grow. Click-bait titles! How old are you? Be responsible. Be nice. Be truthful.
love you jeffree!!!
Jeffree we never gone.  <3
Thanks Chris!. Respect for your work <3.
It's really not easy to loss the 2 people who keep you organized and grounded. You will be fine 🌻
Sheeesh Jeffree finally knows what it like on the real world
love you so much ,,I thank you for all you do,,,
I'm sure u will be fine and u will find someone to do ur videos for u
Love from Wisconsin (: hope everything is on the up and up for you Jeffree! 🙏
We love you Jeffree ❤️
From one boss bitch to another: go slay it, girl! Take some time for u and read a good book.
You'll be back in due time
Jeffree u look soooo good
This video actually hit me hard. Jeffree you’ve got this. 💕
Thanks you guys for watching you guys.....   You guys: I really didn’t....
💖🙌🏼
I want Maddies job!!! I can move in tomorrow
Jeffree should get in touch with Andrew, as it’s not like Shane is filming anything...🤔
Is it clickbait or not?
😔 jeffrey I respect u so much, u have helped me thru some shit in my life..  I want nothing but good thing to come yr way, u mean so much to this WORLD..ALWAYS A FRIEND AND FAM💯👑💕😘🥰😢
Love love love you....
I don’t know why this makes me sad. Seeing jeffree like this effects me a lot it makes me depressed. He was sad during the blood money reveal video. He’s sure full of drama but there are times when you knows he’s really vulnerable. Everything will be okay jeffree things change its okay it’s fine you’ll be alright.
The world is fucked
There's no sadness because of no drama, your enough.
get's complains for not doing a relatable sit down video... what surprise, all of the sudden, he is able to/knows how to stage one. which means the former ones were all meant to be that snobby. wow, okay.
I think we all understand a little how you feel about everything changing. This is one video EVERYONE can relate!  You’ve got this. 💪🏻 😍✨
the dogs were cute tho
I can feel the anxiety and sadness in the video but you’re strong jeffree. I believe you can make it through this. The pandemic is really driving us all insane but this too will end. Sending love from the Philippines 🇵🇭❤️
Tea channels soon: jeffrees former camera guy exposes jefffree blah blah blah
I"m so excited to see what comes next for you!
That video quality is what we all expect 2020 to be 😂 Damn! HighQualityQueen! ❤️
I'm waiting for an eyeliner more than a mascara
What the hell
Always been a big fan since the start...
I will be your new camera man:)))
I love this. No tea, no drama just a life update. I've missed Jeffrey being personal in videos xxx
Much love to Chris!  I'll miss hearing your name, dude!
Still dating Trisha's boyfriend?
You have done and will do great things! I might not be able to enjoy all your new creations but I just love watching to do your thang miss mamma!! Love you so much!!!
Jeffree should stop doing YouTube cuz he sucks
Never give yourself up. I haven’t watched this video yet but this colour you have given the world is your magic. That you have created, manifested and loved. Connect back to music and your heart and find your soul and peace again. Love is in the air and you are adored xxx
He’s going to be a zombie
The thumbnail looks like Doja Cat
I’m only looking at the dogs
I just hope whoever you bring into your life to fill those shoes treats you with love, loyalty, and respect ♥️
Nooooo 😭😭😭💔💔💔
💕
As a Pommy Mommy to 3 of my own can we just talk about how freaking adorable your poms are? 💞💞💞🐕🐾🐾
I’ve been a HUGE fan since the beginning but this video is so stupid! Some of us are going through REAL problems!! I just lost my job a few months ago (real issues)
Too bad I don't live in California! Such a great opportunity to learn so much!😭💔 Keep slaying it we love you!☺️
Andrew could film for you!!
I love the hair 💗 those colours together 💗 I want to create a painting in just different shades of pink now 😍💕
Thank you for the update😘Here’s an idea❤️Let your fans help select your next videographer. Narrow it down to your top 3 and have each film a different YouTube video makeup review for u. Then allow your fans to vote for their favorite in order 1- best, 2-second fav & 3. Of course, you’ll want to suggest some criteria like creativity, lighting, special effects, etc. What does everyone think? Yay or nay🤷‍♀️
Allow your self to adjust , give yourself plenty of working room to adjust to the new rythem of the beat , and go at your own ! Take it , one day at time. Change is hard , your only human, If you we're to cut yourself you'll bleed, right? Right! So in due time , you'll come across the one , who knows maybe it will be one , two or more people behind the camera , I believe this a learning lesson for a new chapter in your life , it just caught you off guard , and unprepared , so with that being said .. Always expect the unexpected , things can change in the blink of an eye! Learn to embrace change , and learn to balance yourself daily, getting out of your usual routines and comfort zones , challenge yourself to step out of the box , you deserve to grow mentally , emotionally , physically, and Spiritually ... You we're not intended to carry the Weight Of The Worlrd on your shoulders Jeffery,
Proud of you! ♥️
The tea is boiling
lol G                                                                        A                                                   Y

Donnatella is so cute
To the people who are somehow still a fan of jeffree: "you a victim"
HE'S SO DESPERATE FOR VIEWS AGAHAGAG
Thank you for leaving such amazing words for the people who helped uplift you Jeffree.   A year of a Pandemic. Not a single person I know hasn't been affected by it. By Death in 2020, early 2021. Everyone is broken in some way & we ALL NEED MORE LOVE & More HEALING moving forward. Let us all hold space for it. 🙏💕
Come to Greece!!!
Ok but I like this quality and one on one . Very personal and there was a connection your channel was missing. Keep uploading
Love you Jeffree ❤️❤️
I have the feeling 2021 will we a good year for miss lynn. God bless his soul his fans will always be there for him
Am I hallucinating?
What a life changing year this will be. Also last year was trying as well. Love and peace ☮️ 🥰😍😇
How can you talk about your film maker leaving but you won't address the most important issues?
Em cosmetics full face review!!!
I wish you all the best for the future. There are so many more wonderful experiences to come for you.
Wow, 16.6 million subscribers!
His “I’m getting emotional” just makes me laugh at this point 🙄😒
me only living 43 minutes away is definitely a sign
Prayers for you. Great things are to come, everything happens for a reason. Love you!
Sorry to see him go
Poor Jefferies he lost his pa,& his camera man as he sits in his million-dollar Mansion surrounded by his thousand dollar dogs how sad🙄🙄🙄
we love you jeffree💗💗💗💗💗💗
Thank goodness!
best positive comment section on a jeffree’s youtube video so far ✨✨✨🌸
OMG IM CRYINGGG!!!!!!
How about  Adam Swords  he is a really good videographer :)
I had to rewatch because I spent the whole time watching the dogs lmao
Just follow your heart Jeffrey,  there are so much changes lately. This costs a lot of time and energy ,take your time and everything will be good again. Love ya
Me wishing I lived in California  👁 👄 👁 💧

Jeffree you will find new amazing people ❤️
I love and admire how genuinely proud and happy Jeffree is for Chris and Maddie that they're progressing through their lives, despite obviously being upset that they're leaving <3
We love you Jeffree ❤️ the best is yet to come for you, can’t wait to see more videos 😊
Me 10 secs in: GIRL, are you you okaay? Do you need a hug?
Why do I love him so much...
Its okay to let go 🤍✨ stay strong and keep yourself safe 🙏🏽😘
I tough Jeffree snake was gonna leave YouTube, so sad :/
I like that for the first time he is not delusional :) . He is in so much pain... God help him.
I reckon they all jumped ship because they saw the red flags
Its so sad.
I clicked on this so fast. I thought you lost Diva.  You're strong & those are tough shoes to fill. But you will find the right people. Sending you positive vibes. Good luck to Chris & Maddy in your future endeavors.
Youuu miss him 😔🤍✨
Hugs  from Brazil... We love you :)
I love this video its genuine not put on or fake and doesnt feel forced. Neither jobs are easy to fill with people who are trustworthy and creative but hopefully he finds them.. I'd apply lol 💜
Jeffree star you are such a positive force.   Thanks for update
All the best to Maddie n Chris they were some real ones... Positivity to the ⭐️ family. We need positivity these days for sure. Everyone stay safe❤️
why isn’t he actually leaving :/
Hope we see you soon!!
So sweet to see Donatella fitting in so well with the other babies. 💖 Oh girl, mascara !!!!! Been waiting with baited breath for that one Sis....
❤️
Gonna feel so weird not hearing "chris what do you think" at the end of makeup reviews, we love him and we're proud of how far he's come. Maddie was amazing and I wish her the best. Jeffree you're amazing and so so strong you will be okay. You're a boss bitch. Love you x
His puppies 🥺🤏
Oh my God. I' m sorry Jeffree!! Be strong dear!! Kisses from italy
Well I for one am looking forward to whatever is coming next! I don't know if you'll ever see this but you actually helped me finally come out as gay. And your confidence and growth has inspired me to believe in myself. So thank you for sharing your life, good and bad. You're a strong bitch and I always look forward to your videos 😘
Lmao
Its truly tramatic times for all of as.
Aww, we'll miss both Chris and Maddie 💜
I have so much respect for you Mr Jeff Star ,I love your channel ,love your content ,thank you for the reviews of products and much more ,I hope you are safe ,God bless you ,lots of love 💕💕💕💕
The US is great with vaccinations, happy for you.
Lol that abrupt ending. He tryin
I just can’t stop watching those adorable puff dogs 💕
Let's appreciate how on point your make-up and hair is 🔥🔥💯🙌... love you loads 😍😘
❤🧡💛💚💙💜
U literally uploaded 2 weeks ago. So dramatic. Lol
Hmm I like who u r becoming ❤️
yeah bye
Best of luck to Chris and Maddie :) xo
So sorry Jeffree! But I have to say, you gave me a bit of Basic Instinct vibes. Which is weird because I was talking about that movie this morning... 🤷🏻‍♀️
💗💓💗💓💗💓💗💓💗
AHHHHH CHRISSS well I wish u the best in life and hopefully some day u might come say hello in a vedio one day 🥺 wish u well
Not me looking only at the doggos and not even listening
Jeffree I can’t wait for you to come back
Love this and your honesty. People forget you also have personal things that go on.
❤️❤️❤️
Ryland for personal assistant and Shane for camera guy.
😘 Mucho ánimo 😘😘😘
So cute dogs, you need to include them more in your videos :) From Ida in Norway
JEFFREE YOU'RE A TOUGH BITCH  I love you dearly, you've been a BIG inspiration for me and you're just amazing. I'm sure you'll be able to find other people that will support and love you in their way❤️
I totally get that your “product reveal” videos need to be in an amazing quality. But honestly, I absolutely love your vlogs and sit down videos done by yourself. I always liked you and I like you even more now 😘❤️
In love with the vibes you give out to everyone. Bad bitch with a good soul. Would be a dream to film for someone like you!
I would love to learn to be a personal assistant. I just need someone to give me a shot. I feel like I haven’t been given an opportunity to show my work ethic. Show me the reigns and I won’t disappoint. I’ve been following you almost since the beginning, I love your content. I know this probably won’t get any attention but these past 2 years I’ve hit rock bottom and I’m ready to start something new! Something better. Give me an opportunity please.
I almost got a heart attack... It's still bad but imagine if jeffree quitted...
Everyone is leaving you but Shane
OMG... are we (me and my husband) the only watching this who wanna put Donatella on a little cracker and just eat her up?!  What cute dogs!  😂
So sorry to hear Chris and Maddy moved on. I always loved hearing his comments while you guys filmed. I literally could not stop watching Donatella playing though just adorable. 😍💗💓💞💕
Jeffree your hair is beyond fabulous. The universe was showing off when you were made. Your puppies are so playful and sweet. The clarity is perfect. Australia.
these cmnts got me confused dab-
Jeffree I need a perfume from you with an iconic bottle as Moschino Cheap & Chic and flankers  and Jean Paul Gaultier classique and flankers .
You always inspire me to live better♡
It was hard to concentrate with all the dogs jumping around 😍 they are so cute ❤️
Jeffree: I used to be a personal assistant to celebrities when I was 19  Me: Jeffree u r a celebrity ♡
The doggies are just so precious 😍 best if luck yo Chris, Jeffree you’ll be just fine 🥰
I really feel for him. I think he's far more upset than he lets on. He literally lost the 3 people that were closest to him in the last year.
"2021 girl.. I hope you are a little more unforgiving" Wow, I don't think he meant to say that :D
why is everybody nice in the comments 😐 did everyone forgot how much of a monster he is ?????????
Now we just need to say bye bye to hairbyjay lol
Bloody Hell, could be worse though, like me, you could realise you have run out of cheese and onion crisps.
The white balance going off every time he moves
„SADLY.. there’s no tea” lol 🤣❤️
when i saw the title i thought jeffree was gonna quit youtube💀
Do Chris’ make up!!!
Hey jeffree I know you said you aren’t looking for a new assistant but I would love to be your assistant your my idol and I would love nothing more than to help you every single day🥺
🙄🙄🙄
Can i be your personal assistant?
You can do this! I’m proud of you Jeffree and you’re such a big inspiration for me ❤️
I can always film and work for you but chances getting picked in comments is pretty much zero but good luck and hope everything works out
I can’t be bothered watching this can someone I watched this  just tell me the gist of this is legit or seems bullshit
Delicious is so good 🥺🥺
That is sad but I hoping Chris enjoys his next adventure I'm in the UK myself🤞❤️
I thought Jeffery is saying good bye to YouTube seeing the Title !!!!! 🤩
Uh hire me to be your personal assistant 😂 I'd move my entire life any where to have that experience. Me to my boyfriend  " pack your bags idc about your life its all about me" 😂
He said he just got done with a photoshoot hence the pink hair and makeup. Does this mean he created a pink eyeshadow palette?! 💖
glad ur leaving! :)
Can I submit my application? Loyal nice and I can roll fattiesssss 🤷🏻‍♀️❤️❤️
Wait are we still getting bad ass makeup reviews? Love you jeffree
A very raw video clip of jeffrey, too sad for him.  But for sure he'll figure it all out.
Bye sis 👋🏼
Am I the only one that thinks Jeffry should do his own little vlogs of like daily makeup and little things here and there? #takeuswithyou
Glad you made the decision to say something. People were just running with rumors like chickens with broken necks flaying around!😂 and that's the truth! Glad your doing as well as you can be. 💕
Wyoming doesnt exist
The way he didn’t say welcome back to my channel
That's a real mom right there! All Jeffree's kids being rowdy, but Momma is focused, 🤣
Hey Andrew how you fixed for a job
Wow... even jeffree can't handle the speed of life...   life is fast guurl.. time flies..
I personaly think the virus is not ending coz there is now the british mutacion and Africa mutacion...I am from a state which is BEST IN COVID and....I don't know how about America, but here it is getting....pretty much worse then better. Really....I think traveling is faaar away still.😄Well Jeffrey...I wish you luck with all the work, finding new people in your team, I would love to go there but I am a child fan so...Im unlucky😂but...I am sure you are gonna find new people soon coz you are amazing in everything you are doing and you are gonna do amazing I know it. Love and peace to you Jefrrey❤❤❤
I’m high af. I’m trying to focus so hard on what you’re trying to say but I can’t stop watching the dogs play 😂😂😂 omggggggg
Please hire me as your personal assistant ☺️☺️
Make music
Ps don’t do that jeffree !!! I thought you was not doing YouTube no more
Jeffree must be a good person to work for.  People judge him so quickly.  But if staff stay for so long then he must be a good "boss " to work for.  I think he's kind, caring and DOES want to help people.  Take care jeffree. Love from South Africa.  😘😘
I could cry for Maddie like I’ma miss her but I am so happy for her !!
İDK why I cried
1 word Kanye?
These hair style is gorgeous 🎀💗
the dogs in the background make the video happier than it should be
I thought you were quitting youtube omfg
I mean there's almost 400 videos on this channel, who wants to rewatch them with me?
More interested in what the D doggies are doing....
Honestly if you need a videographer, call me! Lol I live in a cornfield in Ohio, and I’m a mom.. Which makes me so caring, loving and patient. Seriously though, I know it’s hard to just let ANYONE in your life.. I’m the same.. I don’t have friends, not one, every friend I ever had screwed me over.. even my "parents", have never done anything but (simple answer) TREAT ME LIKE SHIT! I grew up quick and I’ve NEVER had a job except MOM. Lol I know you won’t EVER see this, but if you do.. seriously call me. 😂 LOVE YOU J⭐️❤️
Jeffrey hire Andrew!
We’ve become stronger when we face challenges in life. Jeffree, you’ve become so far in your life, dealt with a lot of shit, you’ll get through this - WE ARE HERE FOR YOU, biiitch! 💛
i like his dogs so fully only reason i endured 3 mins of this video, no more tho
Love ur hair, bb
Love this
Jeffree it says online that you’re Christian but when the video first started you blasphemed the lords name which is one of the commandments you’re disrespecting Gods name and dishonoring him after he has given you everything! Also when you only follow certain things in the Bible or when you only choose certain things to follow in Gods word that is called idolatry. You’re making up a God to suit your sins, a snuggly God that you can cuddle up at night with and he doesn’t exist. Come to the lord✝️he’s the only way and the truth and the life✝️no one comes to the father but through Jesus Christ✝️Repent and become born again in the name of Jesus✝️
You are so fake.  Rich people "problems "
So nice to see you again and that you're doing well❤
dont worry there will be two special individuals to do the work chin up much love xx
*me watching one of his dogs nearly eat another one of his dogs* "Zon't zo it! Z-zon't zo it
JEFFERY i hope u r ok with the experimental jab. For anyone considering it, understand they normally take 3 plus yrs minimum. They have tried to make a rona virus shot for a decade with no success. THESE ARE NOT APPROVED!!! It was only "authorized for emergency use." Its literally still in trial phases and YOU are the ginni pig. If you don't believe me then just watch this interview with Dr faucii reluctantly admitting it along with multiple other incredibly concerning factors. Knowledge is power y'all, wisdom is even more powerful but i hope no one has to learn the hard way if possible. I deeply hope they are perfectly safe but chances are your doctor couldnt even tell u whats in it. Stay well, MUCH LOVE.❤
Love you! I had to come to your channel to see the video. It wouldn’t show up anywhere in my feed and I have all notifications on 😘🥲
YOU ARE REALLY GOOD ON TITLES MY DEAR.
He’s gone its ok you are strong so keep move on, you always have stunning ideas love you JS
We're gonna miss Chris and Maddie. Wishing them the best. And Jeffee we love you honey.
Its sounds like a good partnership in business perspective:)
Love and support you always Queen! Chris will be dearly missed by the star family! Wish him the best
I just wanna say this is why I love you cause your so genuine that you just sound like one of my friends venting ... keep your head high
oh my do NOT take the Mrna vaccine. Please listen forexample Professor Dolores Cahill who say they are dangerous and will f up your health in long rung and its irreversible.
HIS DOG WAS TRYNA EAT HIS OTHER DOG!!! CANNIBLE!!!!!
So sad to know that Chris and Maddie have moved on😥 but I know Maddie will be amazing at her next adventure as well as Chris!! Much love to the both of them! I would die to be your assistant! Much love Jeffree! Please give the babies hugs for me!
There's no Tea?... Don't worry, the You Tube Tea channels will make some for you! xxx
sad eyes,sad voice but life most go o0n live ur life to the fulliest,you have more than others like us
If there’s no tea then why did Maddie delete everything off her Instagram
Epic
Ima just cry in the corner :)
I hate this level of click bait
I live in Tennessee, lemme move there and assist you miss thing!!!!! Ily
so essentially all ur friends ditched you, cool. can't say you have my pity.
Feel free to talk to me jeff,I'll give you positive affirmations and some spiritual guidance ♥️🌏🌴
That hair is giving me anime vibes and i'm in love.
Honestly, I like just you and the camera. I know that's not a practical everyday thing - but you did a good job. Sending positive thoughts your way about finding someone true and loyal. ❤
Jeffree we need a "FULL FACE USING BRAND THAT HATES ME" video again ! Bring us the old Jefree Star please :)
First time seeing Jeffrey's video without Hi!How are ya?😢
i can relate. i can be ur personal assistant. as long as I am not to be be in front of a camera. plus I don't have anyone so.. ~wink
the comments are so filtered oml
@jeffreestar I have no life and completely adore you! CAN I PLEASE BE YOUR PERSONAL BITCH!?!? I’ll move on my own expenses!! I have a vehicle! No criminal background! Clean driving record! Good credit! I’m a multitasker punctual and self sufficient!! I would love the opportunity!! Please and thank you in advance for your time!!
Jeffree Star I love you b*tch but the click bait titles are a bit much at times! Jeffree.....honey you are famous, have a huge fan base including myself, and thriving!!!!! The click bait minor panic attack titles are no longer necessary because I'm literally going to watch it anyway just like everyone else will!!!!! With that being said, I wish you the best of luck on finding the perfect people to replace your recently departed Employees-Friend! XOXO 😘
Damn, about time.
All drama channels have left the chat...
The pups all wrestling is too cute 😍😍 love seeing you just sit and talk Jeffree ❤️ we all love you and your sooooo strong , I can’t wait for the mascara comingggg 🙌🏼 xx
AND TO MADDIE, WE LOVE YOU TOO :) WISHING YOU GREAT SUCCESS FORWARD ♡
Everything will come together with one chapter closing a new one always begins! 🌟💙
Fuck the drama!!! I don't care what I hear about you I don't give a fuck about those toxic people
Chris is irreplaceable 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺 xxx
Erm Jeffree vlogs???🤚🏼💕
I would be happy to film your life, especially wyoming :) from england too. Time to go to slay it in jackson hole lol
Ik hope you find someone who you can trust. ❤️
Ok just saying I'd love to be your camera woman... I've been watching you since your music videos back 2011 or 2012... Lol jk love you always Jeffree
Just always be safe.. And I love your hair😍
Chris, we will definitely miss you mate. The videos that you filmed, edited etc were unbelievably great. THANK YOU CHRIS, LY BRUH ;)   WISH YOU GREAT SUCCESS FORWARD :)
This is rough. If this was amicable, and he really wishes Maddie well... why take 3 months to admit it? Why unfollow each other on Instagram?  You know neither Maddie or Chris can say shit because of the NDA and the timing is suspicious. But maybe now J* expects for his employees to travel back and forth from the unused multi-million mansion in LA to Wyoming on a whim. I am sure there are many who would take that gig for the pay. But I believe Maddie and Chris made more money that all of us, hahah
Sending lots of love n hugs your way❤️
I wish you all the best! Love you so much 🖤🖤
Its not sad that theres no tea. Its sad if there IS tea.
Sending love and prayers to you :)
I hope that you can found a person that you can trust, I been there is so hard to trust when you been through some shit . Wish you the best !
Jeffree is giving me Poison IVY VIBES✨💋
All the support for you babe 💜💫
Los perros en su desmadre jajaja
Chris is probably moving on to something challenging he probably got better jobs coronaviruses changing everybody's world
That's not easy. I pray God will bring the right people to you and He will be your best friend.😊🙏🏻
U are amazing!!! Good ppl will come 2 u!!😊🙌
Whoa i clicked on this video to read some funny comments and jokes but yall so postivie...
This comment section is positive all things considered
Gotta love dem puppies!!!!!!
although i don't support jeffree anymore, this video made me feel really sad for him idk why
South Africa loves you Jeffree🥺❤
I see zero negativity in the comments for the first time um-
Me bitch I’m ready to be your personal assistant miss ma’am! I love you! ❤️😘
I love this video, haven't watched  Jeffree for a long time. This one is really soothing and calm.
Jefree look sadder than when he broke up with his ex
Omg you’re sooo dramatic I thought Chris is dead or something
You're a very strong person and it takes a lot for you to tear down your walls to tell us what's wrong. You're human like everyone else, so it's absolutely ok to have these emotional moments. I hope that you're safe and happy. Thank you for letting me be apart of your life for all these years.
Yesssss Don’t trust people easily! Protect yourself !  Do it yourself on your own! Be Sovereign! Love you
If it hasn't already happened, I hope he gets rid of Hair_by_Jay. That guy has a bad attitude and gives off negative energy.
WE LOVE YOU & SO PROUD OF YOU!  you got this JEFFRIE LYNN STAR!  we'll miss Maddie and chris Lynn haha stay blessed ❤️
he looks so lonely
The click bait of it all!
You're amazing to be strong, thank you
stop deep breathing with your mouth like that ugh
Ugh 🤦‍♀️ click bait much! And maybe make an effort to get dressed.
why u look like jojo siwa here
Anyone else distracted by the dogs? Lol I tried listening to him but the pups were so entertaining! Haha
Love u jeffree
NEVER in all the years watching Jeffree have I seen a video of his that was so real unedited raw emotionally deep that exuded such pure heart break sadness depression just dead inside so lost& gone AND lonely...Truly hurt my heart and pained me to see him exude real depression and loneliness for the first time his acting couldn’t cover his pain.🖤 Stay strong Jeffree, you got this and millions of ppl still love and support you! Pleases never give up! 🖤❤️ Xo
Bro omg I was listening to cigarettes after sex- Apocalypse and i saw the cover of this video when the song said goodbye..
When all I can focus on is the dogs
damn both maddie and chris that’s insane
The calm tone is so much better not the sadness but relatable so like that there is no drama
Your hair style is EVERYTHING!!!!! I would die to be your videographer!!! Omg ..that would be the freaking dream!!! Can't we just have one year without the hate for Jeffree?!? Come on people it's 2021 ...how about showing him some love qnd positivity!
I can feel all the emotions in here, we’ll definitely miss Chris and Maddie on Jeffree’s channel but it’s really heartwarming seeing Jeffree being proud and happy for them on their next journey. Their level of friendship is astounding.
It would fun if he filled these job positions like the old show “my new bff”with Paris Hilton. Lie detector, challenges, dogs liking the new people, etc. Now that would be fun to watch 😂!
Wishing maddie and Chris all the best and it’s nice to see you back jeffree xx
❤️❤️❤️❤️
I love u jeffree. Stay strong
you can make it queen, better days are coming!! 💞
Awwe Jeffree Lynn... Love you so much.  Stay strong.  Always be a stan.
Jeffree: Let's talk to you guys 💞   Dogs: Whose are you talking to, play with us
Everyone, besides this background music, there's an eyeliner coming soon so 😂
Everyone needs to realize no matter the harm that’s been done, mistakes and regrets made,  apologies said, true & untrue rumours circulated, and all the scandals & controversial drama over all these years...He is still a human being with feelings heart emotions. 🥺🖤
Another clickbait story. Sooo sick of it.
CHRIS!!😭😭❤️✨
Love you boo stay strong! love seeing you and ur company grow so proud of you 💕
Awww im gonna miss both of their energies in videos so much. 🥺😔
I would be his assistant for free bitch id be with my fucking Queen lol love you Jeffree 😍
I love you jeffree. You are AMAZING. I just bought my first JSC pallets, concealer and straws!! Literally the FIRST thing I bought with my stimulus!!! Hang in there J we love you!!!❤️❤️❤️
Jeffrey you have got this 👊🏻💥 it’s time to give someone who wants an opportunity to be a p.a and do filmography and they can see you creative style and way to become awesome. X
Is it a backdrop behind him?
Sadly there is no tea?? Be glad there is no tea
We haven't even seen Chris doing Jeffree's makeup :(
I Love You Jeffree!!!
HUGS. ❤❤❤ from the Philippines. 🇵🇭

J.S.....16.660
Jeffree star take care I hope you be back soon
You know he is nervous and not okay when JEFREE STAR is stuttering
I really thought u were saying bye to YouTube forever and I love u so much I'm so happy that ur on a new chapter in ur life
Jeffrer star you are a amazing person and i remember first seeing your music videos when i was younger and going thru a dark time in my. Was bullied and didn't know who i was as a person and u taught me to be comfortable in my skin own what sets me apart and to love. My self i wish u nothing but positivity and love u truly saved me with that i  thank u for being a iconic queen and light
Wow that is a lot , both his friend and camera guy, they if that wasn't enough his assistant too, both are growing and moving into the next chapter of life . But Jeffrey is so sad in this video. Bless you and continue to shine for the gods.
I thought he was gonna say Chris died LMAO
I’ll always respect Jeffree just because he loves animals
Change is painful.  But it bring us inner growth and move us towards living a more fulfilling life. Trust the process, Jeffree ♥️ You ARE a boss b*tch 💯 Praying for you, sending positive energy🍀 and manifesting new good, real, trustworthy people into your life... Love you sm😌♥️
I really like Chris!! wish you all the best Chris!!
Andrew swiki should do it !!!! Garret and Jeffereee are so gd !
You can hire Andrew and Garrett!!!!!!! Camara man and assistant 🤩😬
camera quality is so good, looking like the meatcanyon video
I love you and i wish you get the best
Thank you chris and maddie ❤
Great to see you and thank you for the update. I’ll pop right over with my camera :) xx
BOOOOORRINGGGG
Ya, blah, blah, blah .... where the F is my Mini Orgy replacement palette?  2 I bought are pieces of SHIT!  Guess you can film yourself getting sued 🤷🏻‍♀️. RIP-OFF artist is his new art!
Yikes. Jeffree is looking and seeming more and more lonely each time I come back. Karma hits hard
Get Andrew to film for you!!! He’s clearly not busy with Shane anymore 😂😂😂
Damn y’all I saw the title and shit myself. I thought he was leaving for real!!! I was about to cry lol. It really sucks that they left, but I’m glad there was no drama and I hope the best for all of them! Secretly wishing I didn’t live in TN so I could go work for him, or not really secretly 👀👀 but the future holds what the future holds I guess LOL
What color lipstick is he wearing? It's gorgeous 😍❤💕💖
Jeffree nooo please don't get the vaccine. Covid has a 98.5 recovery rate and many are dying from the vaccine. Vaccines takes years to be developed. I don't want you to die your doggies need you.
"a lot of things going on in my life, a lot of darkness" JEFFREE U ARE THE DARKNESS MY GUY
I swear you were about to say Chris died. Omfg. 😂
Was it even a Jeffree Star video if “the past few days or weeks haven’t been crazy “ 😂
Wish I could give you a huge hug for support, such a strong, amazing person jeffree xxx
I really hope he is wearing pants
Jeffree!!! I literally read the title and thought holy shit, majorly panicking thinking you were shutting down the channel!! So sad Chris won’t be there any more, I always loved your friendship, and Maddie too. Wishing them lots of love for their next adventures❤️
I'm gonna miss Christian and Maddie TBH nobody can replace them but they gotta be replaced 😥😢
Hide Andrew Siwicki. Doesn’t get better than that.
Noooooo
I only heard about half of this because I was so busy watching those cute babies. If you are taking applications, I am ready. No experience but I know how to keep my mouth shut!!
Can’t wait for your next video I miss watching you once a week I know your hard core audience does as well!! It’s time to post weekly babehhh we need our Queen back on track
Side note I love the bows in your hair💘
I had a hard time focusing on what he was saying because I couldn't take my eyes off the TWO TAMALES he had on top of his head. I'm not trying to hate but those two things were certainly distracting!
I love you Jeffree
You got this gurl 💐❤️ We love you jeffree 😽💕
You were NEVER anyone's assistant... the lying... gurl.
Who’s Chris?
Girly set this up that Chris died
Already I can see the headlines be like "JEFFREE STAR BRUTALLY KICKS OUT HIS CAMERAMAN AND PERSONAL ASSISTANT AFTER YEARS OF ABUSE"
He didn't want to work for Jeffrey Estrella ⭐
Yess can’t wait for the chipotle review
who also thought he would quit yt or make up?
Love seeing this side to jeffree, hell with the drama 🎭 this is what it’s about change and growth 💜💖💙💚
💐💖
Hi miss Jeffree if you’re looking for an assistant I’m ready sis dm me🎀 @ kaileecannady on Instagram:)
Thought he was about to stop the channel 😳
Camera quality like whattttttt💥💥💥🤩🤩🤩
It's never easy to say goodbye to ppl who were by our side for years💔 Christian has been an essential part of your channel and it's been so cool to follow the journey of you two creating tons of amazing memories/videos together 😉📹  ...Thank you for making this video, Jeffree♥️
LOVE YOU ♥️🌹♥️

I feel he is so genuine and I love it.
I’ll do the recording I’m pore And love you so it’s a win win
My God you’re sooooo beautiful.  I discovered you through my young niece who always does great makeup on herself and one day I asked her how she learned... and she scream your name!  I said “who”? She said auntie! You’ve never heard of Jeffree Star?!?!?! And no, I hadn’t BUT I DO NOW❣️. Such a great channel. Good luck Jeffree!
Those two probably signed an NDA when they quit lol
💜🙏🤍Love you Jeffree ☆ ❤︎ Remember who you are you are a Scorpio baby we got this!!! シ︎ wish i could be ur next assistant after everythimg that would be so dope literally the  happiest day of my life. If it ever happen... 🤷‍♀️🙏 one can dream. Anyway hope this year will be a good one to remember... 👌😊💜
Where do I send my resume
Change is always good!!! Love you can’t wait for more launches this year 🙂❤️☀️
I’m trying to focus on Jeffree, but all I can pay attention to are his precious poms.
We’re here for you queen. I love you so much.  Keep your head up doll.
Devastated to say the least.....Clicked on as I'm not a sub thinking you where saying "goodbye "!!I'm not a fan,never will be......But 🤫 not all bad as your "friends "are saying goodbye to you"!!
Ohmygod, imagine you are watching this video, and you end up being hired. 🥳
Love u
Finally some positive emotions from Jeffree star!  I like this side of him
I don’t really care about him anymore, the drama & his lies ect ect, pray for yourself.  Maybe if you were honest from the start and wasn’t so vial.....   There’s the tea
Its gonna b crazy not hearing cris behind the camera its sad
Praying for you ! Everything will get better I believe things happen for a reason!!
I'm happy that he has the dog and puppies that love him. At least if humans hate him, the dogs will not.
I know he made a lot of mistakes but i'm here for his wonderful content.
Last time saying goodbye 🥺😢😭🌸✨❤️
Shew Jeffree I feel for you. This year has been rough and I hope the second half of your year gets better. ♥️♥️♥️
Nick Lamarque!!!
Love to you♥️♥️♥️
You got this Jeffree. Changes can seems so hard at first.  But when it growth and change can be difficult.  But this can only mean change and growth for yourself. One learns so much of ourself during times like this.
Bathrobe Jeffree is the best JEFFREE! ♥️
😍😍😍😍
Idk why this video has sad vibes to it, even when Jeffree laughed and smile it's seem empty and sad
Farewell Christian and Maddie! It’s been our pleasure to get to know you both over the years throughout the scenes of JSC..
I can't look at his hair without thinking of bacon🥓😂
Come on!! You can!! We miss you!! 😘😘
Makes sense that Chris is moving since u r not popular anymore like before..yr bank account is full but not yr life..I feel sorry for u
His look is giving me Barbie vibes 😍
JUMP SHIP! Jefree is canceled! Yikes!

My heart dropped when I saw the title 😅
Cheerup mommy🥺❣️
Thanks for the video!! Good luck with all your new changes and good luck to your former employees!!
Omg not me crying again for this queeeen omg we are here and with you honey ❤️❤️

Wishing you all the best jeffree and of course Chris and Maddie I loved them in videos too but stay strong sending lots of positive vibes~
Dude, how many of the ‘darkness’ you mentioned did YOU generate..? I’m so sorry but I have no sympathy.
lol I wish I could film your life. 🤣💖 especially cause I also smoke. And really want to meet your dogs lol but obviously you aren’t just gunna let some lifetime fan film you lol
Hire Taylor King. She’s genuine.
Is Jeffrey I know you do a lot of cosmetics I had a I wish you do perfume I would definitely thought perfume I'm too old to wear makeup I'm sexy find like to have perfume perfume I definitely get that one but my daughter loves your makeup one day I'll get her makeup for you from from you to get to my daughter
This was sooooooo dramatic honestly I thought someone had died lol wtf that was dumb
I'm sorry but over exuberant shows of wealth during a time of great loss is just ridiculous and him trying to relate is just off and even more disconnected from the reality of the general public.
Can I be your personal assistant? I have no ties and commitments 👋
Bacon hair

Jeffree: talking about saying goodbye to his people with love Donatella: destroying blanket beside him
Imagine your 2020-2021 “crazy” being losing your personal assistant and cameraman. Other people have lost their jobs and houses 🙄 so out of touch
can I get hired cause your girl needs a job
I can see how much you enjoyed their company. I miss a lot of the people who played important roles in my life too. I moved cross country away from my mom and it hurts so much everyday. Every day is a day away from my mom and I miss her so much. I know I have to be an adult. Im trying. But I need my mom.
Baby, you're always changing and we love you for it!  I truly hope you will find good, decent people to help you! Oh my God I want to cuddle those sweet furbabies!  Blessings to you on the next chapter!  Love you
I'm sad about Chris not being his camera man ill miss him in the background 🥺🥺
I cannot help it, his dogs are cute, so cute that a I get a urgent cuddle syndrome! All of them but the black one.... Awww!!!! And to get some water and having to pee is just refreshing human and normal Jeffree! And sometimes that is more needed from you, then perfection all the time, at least that is how I feel! That Jeffree you show here, very likable!
It's so difficult to find people who dont drive you crazy, can hold confidence, AND match your work ethic. Prayin for ya love.
Hopefully you'll find people that are trustworthy, that shit is hard to find
Jeffrey please wait on the vaccine wait until it’s FDA approved if not you’re just one of the test goats
What a lonely life
I thought the name of the pallete was going to be “Saying Goodbye...”
Me sees jeffree putting camera on trypod Me: didn’t he have a camera man ? Jeffree: I have got camera man no more 😭
Love your hair 🤩
Wishing them both the best of luck, and sending you positive vibes Jeffree to finding some more amazing employees/friends to fill their shoes!!
What if Jeffree hires Andrew 🤔😂 the shadeeeee
Those babies and Jeffree looking all the perfect in this video. 👌🏼
2020 sucked so bad...lost my husband of 19 yrs 1 week before Christmas along with other family members thanks to Covid...my anxiety has been through the roof can definitely understand you there....surely hope 2021 is sooo much better for everyone
oh man i didn’t realize this was six hours ago i just wanted to know if he’s uploaded recently lmao
Just quit YouTube already. Terrible person
Oh Chris. We will miss u
Try-outs or auditions to be Jeffree’s cameraman 😭 ima train for it
*Insert clip of Whoopi saying “Ok”
Goodluck with your search for people that are going to fit in perfectly with what you want and need. Changes like that can be tough and I look forward to meeting these new friends you find! Do I miss the content? Yes. Do I understand things happen and everyone has their own lives? Also yes. I love watching you Jeffree and I cant wait for more to come. Good luck and take time to relax!
I love you Jefree I’ll still be here to support you no matter what any haters say you’re clearly capable of showing vulnerability and that’s relatable because we all feel fragile sometimes especially right now. Lots of love from Washington💖💖💖🍃🌲🗻
Am I the only one who finds it hard to believe anyone on YouTube?
Donatella fighting all the way through the video to get comfy next to Jeffree, then gets picked up and moves anyway!  I’m exhausted watching her.
Jesus LORD, Jeffree!! Don't give a bitch a heart attack with your title!! Take care of yourself, it'll all get better!
so like is he finally leaving youtube or not imao
i have anxiety by just reading the title
But every other video is a launch? So that’s probably why people think you only make video when you launch a new product.....
i wish chris the best. that’s a true friendship🥰
We need face mask from your brand!!!!!
Hope you stay happy, on course.
Thats saddd
Sending you a hug. People do come in and out of your life for a reason.  It’s sad you will miss them both, at least they where in your life and I am sure they feel the same way.  Xxxx  I love your YouTube channel keep smiling. Lots of love pxxxx
I wish christian maddy and Jeffree all the best i already seen people trying to start rumours about how maddy got tired of jeffree or some other lie. People are ridiculous. They act like they're there with jeffree 24/7 they only see a glimpse of his life in videos.
YAY. BYE!
Oh yooohoo my Name is Aaron but i go by Astrella Jane im 20 turning 21 in November. Im a stuggling model i have loved you and looked up to you sense your punk music phase id love to work for you i aint got nothing holding me where i am
I also did emotional housekeeping. When I leave this section of life it is not as the same person.
Wishing them both the best in their next and future chapters. 💜
This is the year you’ll have a new camera man, new assistant and new love❤️ and more followers. This is my wish for you💓 Sending you tons of hugs from San Diego🌴
How are y’all Scorpio‘s these day‘s.
After all of this, I'm so sorry and feel for him so HARD! Losing TWO MAJOR players is heavy because being in the biz its SO HARD to find trustworthy people especially ones he's had for YEARS!! But I'm sure we all wanna know how do we apply?? Lol
I just love you and how real you are!!! Just keep being yourself!! Your super  AWESOME!
Love you so much jeffree!!!! You look better than ever.  Rooting for you always.
Donatella 💖 💕 💖
I can’t take him seriously anymore
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤🙏🙏🙏🙏
*casually nominates myself to be your PA* (and hey I’m British so you’ll have the accent and charm around you again 😁)
I’ll be waiting for that chipotle review 👀
Hire Andrew or Garrett!!!
I would totally be his personal assistant.
STAY STRONGGGGG !!!
Camera guy: Gone Personal assistant: Gone Hair: By Jay
I’ll miss Chris from this channel, but where could I get an application? I would literally DIE to work for Jeffree in any way 💕
I'm glad everyone is healthy. I was a bit worried for a minute! Love ya Jeffree!
I couldn‘t concentrate on the video cause i was watching the dogs all the time
Where’s Maddie
Omg why did my brain immediately think he was going to say Christian died! Thank god he is ok 😂
Jeffreeee!!!! You had me so scared with your caption 🥺
WHATEVER
Yas I love Christian! Good luck.
I just would have really liked seeing a goodbye video with Maddy , we’ve seen her in so many videos and have grown to like her. when people move on from a position they always have a farewell party, why couldn’t they have filmed part of that
Take ur time recovering from this. I understand the heart ach ur going through.
Sending you lots of positivity. 💕
Omg, I am graduating from Parsons School of Design for photography and i just wish i had the experience to replace half of what christian was able to do with you and this channel. Working with someone as creative and like as chill and fun as you seem like it would be a dream honestly 😍
When jeffree put the puppy down and he just layed right down next to him!! Eeeeee! 🥰 So much love 💕 💕💕💕💕
I’m here for those dogs. Is anyone even watching anything else in this?
Praying for you Jeffree 🙏I definitely can feel your sadness 🙁stay strong love you 💗💟
I genuinely hope he finds the right people to fill the shoes of his cameraman and assistant. Like he said, it’s not so easy for him to just be able to throw a job advert out there. I wish him luck on this endeavour.
❤🧡💛💚💙💜🤎🖤
Thank you for this! ❤ love you
I can see the genuine in this, there is so many good intentions within you and I notice it. I wish you well, and I hope you restock my sizes in apparel! I’m dying for it. Good luck ❤️
good luck and come back soon .
Who’s now going to edit the videos in the future  wait did Chris edit ur videos
Omg ima miss Maddie so much
So, the ad at the beginning of the video was a prayer... And it said "Hell Is Real".😐
Change is good, is daunting and exhilarating at the same time, but it’s good.  I think it’s very good for you, learning to stand alone and on your own two feet, not needing an entourage ALL the time is very healthy.  There’s nothing wrong with old school filming, like you did today, is good as well. Keep the natural nails.   I’ve enjoyed the deconstructing of yourself.  The last year has been difficult for so many, in so many ways. I was laid off for almost three months, return to work, and then my agency went out of business. First time in my adult life that I found myself unemployed, unable to pay bills, and wondering WTH I was going to do with my life. I’d been with the same agency for 20 years, living in the same place for 26. My mom turns 86 on the 30th of this month, so I move back to my home town, and in with her, as I am her primary care giver, and just started a new job. Being broke isn’t fun, having to wait a month before getting paid for the first time isn’t fun, and worrying that your car is gonna get repo’ed when you have less than six months left before it’s paid off isn’t fun. But it’s all good.I focus on trusting that things will work out, taking each day as it comes, reminding myself to breath, loving my 7 fur babies, and treasuring the moments I’m having with my mom.
I’ll be the 1st to admit I was one of the ppl upset about content but knowing what I know now I whole heartedly apologize for ever coming at you
Can i be your personal assistant Jeffree plsss im a fuckin good person i can cook i can clean i can do anything
5:49 Dessert after getting a tiny headbonk: Bye biss😄 btw, Chris, you will be missed!
Aw jeffree ...we love you
Ill be your assistant Jeffree, I’m a LA native. Hair looks so fab btw 🤗
Andrew should be the camera man!
This camera quality is literally life changing😩❤️
I'm so sorry my dear. Going to miss Chris!
Best wishes for you, Jeffree and Maddie and Chris.
Damn I was hoping you were the one leaving
We will all miss Chris! Hearing him chime in during the videos was always so cute. Hope life gets better for all of us this year❤️
**me thinking he's leaving... :)** *him not leaving*              :(
❤️
Your hair bows look BEAUTIFUL in this
Lmao just came here to dislike
I love you Jeffree!! Hang in there. Life will get better sweetheart! Ps: I watched the whole video & it was beautiful!
Jeffree IS THE BESTTTT....
I WISH I COULD BE YOUR ASSISTANT!!
Love you so much!!! Can’t wait to c what you have this year in store!!!
OMG that’s sad, when people you love and trust needs to leave you to grow on their own, it”s like what a mom feels when the kids finally have to leave the nest. And that is actually heartbreaking. I hope you find really good hearted people to be with you and help you in the future.
I would honestly kill to be jeffreessss personal assistant!!!!!!!! Or at least give me a chance please
Hope you find the perfect staff. 🥰
Everyone in his life is leaving him
you are strong and wonderfull. Good luck in everything💕love and peace
Omg I wish I could fall into ur life to be ur personal assistant. That’s such an amazing experience to have and what a great way to gain experience in that field.. I wish u the best of luck Jeffree on finding new replacements u deserve the best!!
What was this video for SERIOUSLY
i love you keep going u are amazing!!!
I'd totally take the job but I live in Canada so RIP
You got this!! 💗
I thought he was leaving YouTube.... ooos
LOVE YOU
There’s no moving up from filming Jefree ⭐️   I want to know the tea!
Don't stop your youtube.
I vote Andrew Siwicki
People come and go, teach us lessons and help us grow. I’m glad they decided to spread their wings and explore new things. But with all this, they will surely be missed❤️ ( also I read the title for the video and thought you were quitting YouTube... slight panic attack but I’m okay! Lol) back to the original subject, everything will fall into place. It always does and I’m sure you’ll figure it out, you always do!!
damn even madison got tired of his toxic ass 😭😩
Why I wanna cry when I see this. I felt him..  I lost a lot of my friend too .. during this pendamic.. a lot of changes. I Cry when he said "the cameraman is moving to the next chapter" that guy.. is talented..
Unsubscribed 🙌🏻👋🏻 didn’t even watch the dumb video
Choooose me😭🤧
A a former fan, if y'all haven't realised by now that he's a Sociopath who only cares about his image and money, I feel sorry for you. This isn't directed to those that are only a fan of his content, but those who are loyal to him as human being. You are being played so hard.
I can´t concentrated of what jeffree is saying beacuse of their dogs
🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸
Your new baby is SO CUTE AND FUNNY. I’m dead 😍😍
Gorgeous
Borrrriiinnnggg
Sending so much love and much respect to everyone! I will ALWAYS be loyal Jeffree, whether you ever see this or not.
Love love love your look and how you’ve delivered this video. 🥺🤍 Sending love!
So, cute doggo?  I am dying from all the background cuteness.
I mean if you are hiring , pick meeee! 😭🤣
The dogs are killlliiiiinnnnggggg me!!! 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

Check out Adam. He does the filming for Producer Michael, another your  Channel. He is English, too.
I hope you work with Andrew since you already worked with him..
About time
I LOVE YOU JEFFREE STAR!!!!!! simple as that😊😙💄
Aw the one time I wished I lived near Jeffree! How amazing it would be to be friends & work for him. I have a family so obviously I couldn’t just move alone but my family might come lol. I know you’ll keep doing great things Queen!!!
I wanna be the one to film you 😭
But if there was no drama b/w you and maddy Why the hell she unfollowed you on insta but not unfollwed JSC?? Gottcha! You still not real!
I thought he was leaving youtube, sad to hear he isn’t
what a shame. i thought you were the one who was saying goodbye.
Love the dogs 😆
Noooooooo! Say it is isn't so!
Lol why am I listening the Jeffree talk as I watch the dogs play... aka Donatella go ham on that blanket haha
I love jeffree , sad to see ppl limit him so much with criticism and negativity.
If you have many vacancies, please hire me! 😂❤
🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
Queen you got this 🥰 love the hair 😍
Y’all when I first saw this I freaked and thought he was quitting YouTube or something!!! 🤣🤦🏼‍♀️
Let's not bring up Shane. We all know he is cancelled for life
Please come to the UK and have a meet up with Chris and MMMMitchell too!! It is not safe here to even think of traveling yet but we are getting there!! xx
I really dont give that much of a fuck to watch this, can someone tell me if hes leaving the internet or what. I'm tired of hearing about his bullshit.
I literally love you Jeffree Star 💖 You are such a golden personality, and I LIVE for it. Thank you for keeping us updated!
I thought he was going to quit youtube
I’ll send you my resume 😭😭
'bitch, I know that I'm strong. but this is a lot.' every strong person can relate. no one will quit!
Can I be your personal assistant?
We need to just hang out. I love to just learn . I'm just getting to old I want to stay young. You help me stay true.
Its ok Jeffery take your time you are amazing an wonderful you have inspired me more then you can know thank for being you you are incredibly an amazing am strong an smart an funny. We understand thing are hard an you can take as long as you need. Start strong you wonderful human being
omg me había olvidado completamente de la existencia de jeffreeeeeeeee
Jeffree Star this was not important, please stick to making your videos that we all know and love.
The only video that feels genuine.
This tittle scared tf outta me! I thought Jeffree was saying goodbye 😭😭😭, this is just as sad, even though they were mostly behind the scenes they were a huge part of the J 🌟 empire, part of his brand, his friends, and most importantly his FAMILY😭😭😭, I know who ever is lucky enough to get either position on the team will have some really big shoes to fill, I'd up root in a heartbeat for that opportunity 😂😂😂,  I can't imagine how hard it is on Jeffree trying to find replacements for them, and being able to trust someone, basically with his life, he has to be able to trust them in his homes, at his factory, to keep certain parts of his life private, with his fur babies...not to mention how many will try for the jobs seeking clout and recognition, I know he's got to stressed over it all 😭😭😭, I hope he finds 2 perfect people to fill the positions, but  we all know they'll never be another Maddie Lynn or Chris 😭😭😭, I wish them the best,  and will miss them.
I'll literally work for you for free. ✨
I keep focusing on the pups! Good luck Chris!
Thank Gud
🥰 much love to you Jeffrey I'm visiting in Chicago, my children are grown. I haven't had a job in years due to knee surgeries but it would be a blast to work with you. I hope you find the right fit for you and your babies. Love you 🥰
I had to keep reminding myself Chris didn’t die and has just gotten a new job while watching this
Just take your time in choosing a new videographer.  Do not rush it!!!
Who has the spark notes?
Jefree looking like a frazzled dad is so heartwarming. ❤️
How can I apply for these jobs. I'm genuinely and honestly interested.
And girl, this haaaaair 😍👑💕
Not only are you coming up, BUT!!!  You brought all the others up with you!  Such a sweetie ❤️❤️❤️
I’m a JS fan, not a basher, just wondering why Maddie and Jeffree is not following each other on instagram anymore? 😞
Well why don’t you ask taylor king she might know someone that can help you she is a you tuber also just FYI
11 minutes of me watching the dogs play tbh
Jeffree is trying to be sentimental and his dogs are in the background screaming at each other lmfaoo.
This is sad, them leaving, you're gonna be missed guys... But happy that you're all good and growing. 👏🏻❤️
Oh Thank God!!! I’m cool with people growing and starting a new journey in their, “Big Book of Life!” 🤩🤩🤩 But Jeffree, honey, you had my ass thinking one of the dogs died!🤪💝🙃🤣
💕
The quality of this vid is great!!!
❤️
Let's all just appreciate how real jeffree is with everyone.  Love you jeffree 💓
I’m down to be an assistant 😌
"Bitch I know I'm strong, but it's being a lot" You don't even know the hard times that I've gone through,  and you have been a total inspiration to me to start over. I really admire you. You're a f---ng badass!
I literally couldn’t concentrate because of the dogs in the background 😂 They’re just too cute to not pay attention to!
Love you jeffree!
I don't care too much for money, money can't buy me love...
Just a few months ago Jeffrey star had 20 millions subscribers and now he’s at 16? Did I miss something?

Jeffrey darling, I love, love, love your babies!! I use to have a black Pom Pom named Georgie Boy after Georgia Armani of course, yes, and he had the same temperament as your little midnight beauty does sitting by your side like a prince. So beautiful!! Miss him dearly! I sincerely hope Christian does well in all his future endeavors in life and that you will find someone soon,  not to replace,  but to take over his duties as your videographer. Thinking of you Jeffrey and wishing you much joy,  happiness and success this 2021 and by the way..you are stunning!! Can't wait for your next tutorial..whatever will it be?  Much 💖💄🥰

I miss your reviews you have inspired me.. i do not care about the drama never have .. your personality is awsome i hope you see this i feel like you need some positive vibes ... i cant wait for more videos and see what you have coming next with your brand ...love and light ❤🙏
I hope things get better or stay good 👍
This is totally irrelevant and random but can we just take a moment to appreciate the hairstylist who did Jeffery's hairstyle... I mean it's SO gorgeous
Aw I know you'll have ALOT of people praying for you and I will be one of them.. your videos have helped me thru some rough times, I will pray that you get thru yours.. you're a boss strong as hell I know you'll get thru whatever life throws at you!
I’m not gonna lie my heart dropped when I saw the title ☹️ I was thinking noooo please don’t say that we won’t have any more videos from you because I really enjoy them and you have shared with us so much and I have learned a lot about make up from you so thank you so much for sharing and I’m so happy that you’re going to still be filming because you brighten up our day, I’m sorry about your friends and crew not being around and I hope that you will find some great people to work with and build great friendships with too, thanks so much for everything 😊💖
Love you💖💗 you are so Inspiring Jeffree. I so want to try your cosmetics 🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻  Just know everyone comes into our lives for a reason and new doors open🙌🏻 I know it’s will only get better 🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🔥🌟
*we will miss Chris but we hope he has a bright future ahead*
@jeffreestar where do I apply to become your personal assistant??
Aww I love you Jeffree 🤍🤍🤍 stay positive ✨
I’m so glad you didn’t say you were saying goodbye to YouTube! I love your videos
ok but how do i apply for the personal assistant position 👀👀👀👀👀👀👀
I will pray for you, jeffree. ❤️
Having to watch twice because only paying attention to the dogs
Who else thought that he was going to say that Christian was dead when he stopped talking for that long pause?  I am also very surprised that Christion did not hand pick his replacement and do test runs so he wouldn't leave Jeffree in this situation, he surely knows some people in the field personally. On another note, why hasn't he seen his family in years? 2020 was horrible buy we made it through and now I hope that it has strengthened everyone's determination and resolve.
We will miss Chris and wish him the best of luck, true friend stayed through everything and you should definitely keep close to him in some way.
Me seeing the title: this is clickbait  Me while clicking on the video: maaaaybe he really is finally leaving us for good.  Me 2 mins into the video: nope it was clickbait fuck bye.
I hope you find true friends and workers. I always feel when people have money, u never know who is a true friend and who is there for the money. Good luck Jeffree
Praying for you. I know you’ll get back. Breathe. Play with your dogs and some makeup. ❤️
I'll be your personal assistant ❤️
So fun watching the doggies in the background!
You will be fine Jeffree you’re a boss good luck
Made me Sad
Jeffree being a mom telling dessert stop super cute
TRUST GOD! FIRST and everything else will follow!
this video was a waste of time and major CLICKBAIT!!!
To lose both of them must have been crazy! That's sucks! I hope they both do well!
I actually lowkey shipped you and chris
Something big is going to happen.  He knows it
I love u jeffrey stay strong 💯💯
If you're looking for a New assistant... I'm french.. 47.. 😘
No moor Chris giggles 😭
And down the snake goes... farewell 🥵
Hey Jeffree, I got my mini Blood Sugar palette in the mail today. I love it so much. It’s really good.
That’s so like my little fur babies in the background too 🤣 my fur babies always think it’s play time and they get on the trampoline and it’s like a little fight club ring going on 🤣🤣 I think all little fur babies do this 🤣 especially when we stop paying attention to them for two minutes 😂
You can always hire Andrew Siwicki lol. Since Shane is not making videos.
BYEEEEE. WONT MISS YA
Love you Jeffree 💖
Best wishes for you sweetie. You’re looking gorgeous as ever!
That is a lot, I sure hope you find someone soon. Good luck with the search.
Girllll I been trying to move out there for so long I almost was able to this year but it wasn’t able to getting a job with you would be a dreammmmm 💜💜
Came in here like “now what” lol
Freww
Got clickbaited but it isn't as bad as I thought...  Wishing the best for Chris and Maddie...
I wish Chris well.
We are going to miss Christian😥Please don't leave us Jeffree 💔
If you need a new personal assistant, hire me! I love your business and would love to work for you!
wait what's going on
I enjoyed this...haven’t had a nice sit down for a long time. Simpler days. Feel free to just sit down and just chat with us whenever and take care!
Loving his hair lol
Why does he get the vaccine?!  He's not that old! I want one too!!
Love you Jeffree ❤
Girl I'll be ur personal assistant lol we would be bffs...
we haven't even see jeffree does chris's makeup and he already quit
Im so confused why you would say “SADLY there’s no tea” ? Why wouldn’t you be like “THANKFULLY  there’s no tea and things just ended on a peaceful note”....???
Jeffree : "Saying Goodbye..."  Me having a panic attack after reading title : "OMG IS JEEFREE FED UP OF BEING A YOUTUBER AND IS FOREVER LEAVING US😱😖😩"  ***lots of internal screaming and yelling
I live in Long Beach and currently a part time caregiver which is like being an assistant, I would love Wyoming and literally I have nothing holding me back. Pick me!
Please say goodbye to the internet for good 😃✌🏻
Holy shit those r 2 huge roles to fill. Those 2 r probably the main ppl that helped u make who u r today! I hope everything is good with u and both them and they succeed in whatever their next steps are! Good luck to all of you!
maybe this will humble JS a little, maybe this is the wakeup call that he needed?
Love yougirl @jeffreestar
Anybody else kept getting distracted by the pups in the background? So adorable. 🥰
Hit me up Jeffree Lynn I'll be your personal assistant.  I mean we have the same initials, I'm Jamie Lynn, that's gotta be kismet right.
I feel you, JS.  And OMGGGEEEEE THABBABBBYYYYY is so active & cute like a Lil tiny tumbleweed just rumblin & tumblin around!   I would so work for you.  I'm 40 & a recent empty nester & could go for some glam & adventure in my life right now!  Whenever you're ready, I'm here. 💘💖💗
Honestly I wish all of Jeffree Star Cosmetics should move out of California, people would buy more if they didn’t have to pay California online order sales tax. It’s really the primary reason I don’t buy more than I do. It’s just too expensive on the shipping.
wheres nathan
Ok serving
i love ur makeup in this video.u always look amazing but something about this stlye just wow...
Jeffree...don't say goodbye. Love you!
Always love hearing you speak. You are a beautiful soul!
"we are saying bye"
Jeffree, you look so sad. Please take your time and make sure you’re at 100% before you dive back in. The last year has been crazy and you deserve a break from YouTube. Know you have people who care, ok? Lots of love ♥️♥️
I love you jefffreee
I'm applying for you as personal assistant..❤️❤️❤️
Bye

Good for you Jeffery. I hope you can find people who can help you along the way. I don’t watch you a lot now but I think that I will defiantly start watching you again. Stay safe, and mentally healthy!
*Me moving to California to fall into Jeffrees life to be his assistant* 😂😆
Ugh I wish I was a tech wiz I’d love to film your videos and just be apart of your journey 😭🥺❤️
Wow! So proud of how far you’ve come Jeffree! I will always love you and support you on any decision you make in your life! 😊💕 Sending good vibes your way! ♥️ ✈️
i was hoping he actually quit youtube
drop your hair stylist next tff
Jeffrey that robe was making me nervous the entire video!  🤭
LOL! Trust me!  i'm from 🇨🇦 canada!
Adonna and Donatella lets do it I want Maddies job I GOT U J N IM Vaccinated n know cpr in case u lose you inhaler 😉 😟
Laying off a videographer and assistant and taking a commercial plane to WY. Hmmm, is J-Star going broke?
I LOVE YOU
Beautiful
Best to Christian and Maddie! Hope wherever life takes you it's wonderful there. Good luck Jeffrey may the people who will be the best for you and your life fall into your space.
Awww love u ur amazing ❤️❤️❤️🥺
Something is up if 2 people so close to him left at the same time. I'm sure he couldn't come trash their names, as they probably know so much dirt being around Jeffrey for so long!
that was so raw i love it
What happened to the brows??
Jeffree you are an amazing person and have so much to offer and maybe tour search for an assistant may be someone a little older that comes into your life. How do I apply?❤️❤️❤️😁😁😁
Think of this as a start of something new ! Change is scary of course but look towards the horizon and be excited for yourself and Chris and Maddie 🥰
I thought you were about to say he died. I'm like wtf
I can help you with your nails since I do my own. I do acrylics I make my own powder combos
Aww we are gonna miss them too 🥺
i Will always love jeffrey star No matter what! lol 😂
LMAO  your new puppy is tearing up that blankie lolol
Was thinking about you this morning.  Glad to hear from you and wishing you wellness..  Sending love.
Where can I apply for the assistant position!!!
Am i the only one who thinks something went wrong
I would love to see Jeffree Vlog. Like genuinely vlog his life. His breakfast, work, playing with the dog. A more personal perspective. That’s would be awesome. I hope he sees this and hopefully give him some ideas ☺️💜
I’m from philly jeffree ILL FILM YOU!! lol I’ll do whatever you say 😳🥺😎
Umm Ms. Jeffree where are your nails ?? I it’s the first thing I look for in every video ❤️.
Um what..........?
Omg he said chipotle and now I’m starving
I love the hair btw. The bows are everything
Love you jeffree 💓 you'll get it figured! Just enjoy your journey.
I totally get it, although I know  change can take some getting used to. That said, I find many people have re-evaluated their lives this last year and want to explore new things, and now is a great time to do it, so much change yet so many potentially great opportunities. I wish them both only great things in the future, they’ve certainly earned it and will definitely have interesting resumes. And Jeffree, you’ll be more than ok once you find the right people for the job, and like the old saying in Spanish says, “for every door that closes, a new one opens”. I truly want the best for everyone, eliminate competition and cancel culture once and for all, I want us all to come out this chaos together, side by side, helping each other truly live our best lives yet, there’s enough space in this world for all to succeed.
awe, this broke my heart, I wish nothing but happiness for you and Chris, because that's what y'all have given me , I love you Jeffree, ❤️
💚💛💙❤Jeffree... May this year bring you PEACE and serenity...  Many prayers and blessing to you for whatever the future brings you and those you LOVE 💚💛💙❤
Im sorry but seeing jeffree without nails is like ariana grande without high ponytails
❤️❤️💜😭😢❤️😍😘❤️💛💗💙
This setting is very real. Now I’m ready to listen.
I know your not putting up a now hiring sign.    But im a drag queen that wants to know the makeup world. Teach me everything and why not.  Ill unofficially apply for the personal assistant position.   JaymeCoxx working with jeffreeeee Starrrrr.... i can see it now. Fabulousness
Go through an official recruitment company maybe??  <3
Aww jeffree i wish u nothing but blessing :)
Another video witha whole lotta nothin.
How CUTE are the puppikins?   OMG!
We'll miss Maddie and Chris, but as always everything you do is amazing and we're looking forward to the next chapter! ❤
Literally so sad about this whole thing but I love how positive he is for them both that’s real love On a side note would love to be Maddie she was so phenomenal!! They should’ve all had star last names because they were family! 💗
Get Andrew to be your camera man. You know Shane’s camera man?
🥺🥺🥺 bye, Chris. JEFFREE DO NOT GET THE VACCINE
Hugsss from PH 🇵🇭
My chihuahua grabs my blanket and pulls it just like your baby does! So sweet !!
Where you going boo? Much love 💕
It's the background music for me
I love you jeffree and I hope everything starts to get better for you 💞🧘‍♂️
I just want to give you a very big hug
I was here at 666k views.
Jeffree Star always for ever and ever will be the strongest Diva and Queen 👑 ❤️❤️💯💯💯
I feel so emotional about your "tittle " omg .. to Chris good luck brother and thank you for the company to JS. Bless you
Donatello is so fucking cute bitch!!! ❤️❤️
Ok I work at a grocery store and I have been lucky to still have my job but I am getting tiered of hearing youtubers say they are missing all the traveling and all the meet and greetings to me it sounds like they are missing their egos being boosted and their asses being kissed. I love youtubers and the work the creat to entertain us but please stop ✋ Life is hard but I am sure your million dollar houses and expensive cars and easy lifes where yall are will get you through this hard time 🙏
You will find new soulmates that will help you continue with the amazing work ur doing
Best wishes to Christian and Maddie.  💖
I’ll help you film your videos and be your personal assistant.I have all the time in the world for you.I could live anywhere for as long as you need me too
DAMN ! I thought he was saying "goodbye" as in he is leaving, gone !
I think we're all actually waiting for your foundation line.....
I thought Chris had died 😬🤭🤭🤭
Love you Jeffree!!!! Hang in there!!! Praying for you!!!! Best wishes Chris and Maddie you will be missed!!!
Im a pro photographer and I’d apply to be Jeffrees photog/videog in a heartbeat.. But with 2 kids, one is 18 and soon to graduate and a 13yr old, and they both cyber school, and a husband and dogs and a house, I’d never be able to... He needs someone that can, no joke, devote their life to him. It’s literally like, having a plutonic relationship, in a way, to take on that type of work. And your mouth better have a zipper because you can’t talk(spread gossip) about what you do for him.
Te amoooo
No one else thinks it’s weird that Christian and Maddie went their separate ways around the same time? No one?
Where can I apply for the assistant position?  🥰
Jeffree star: billions of views Me: bitch where? 🤣
Love you, everything is gonna be alright
Always drama with this person
Hang in there sweetie! New roads, new directions. Nothing wrong with that. It’s life. Love you!
Kaycee??? Chris ledoux's old place? =D
Maddie quit back in December.... this isn't new news..... the only thing somewhat recent is that she's got a different job and is no longer following jeffree star cosmetics on Insta.
Jeffree make crying 😥 I hear in his voice sadnes. 2 big personality in his life. I wish them great life and new beginnings. ❤️💙You can see in Jeffree eyes that he is  honest🏳️‍🌈
When the foundation coming 😁❤❤❤
Wow, you just came so correct. It’s like I met Zeus at the gates of heaven and we spent the day at Venus’s SPA. You looked like an intergalactic space worrier strawberry princess in a robe... someone needs a raise 📈
:}
I be like, Where do I send my resume? lol. Nonsense aside, good luck finding a loyal assistant, I constantly see all these celebrities end up with people selling their information or recorded calls for an extra buck  or better yet creating a book about their life with all their secrets.
Good luck on all future endeavors Chris and Maddie!! You’ll both be missed. Personally I’m going to really miss the “what do you think Chris?” in videos haha.
Why am I seeing so many positive comments...this man ended and tired to end so many careers...and so much more I mean seriously..
Jeffree! Morgan Adams, get Morgan! She would be a perfect add to the Star family! And for the record, if you could get Shane to travel, even he would be a great pick for running the filming. And he can edit with the best of them too. Ryland is great with everything, so heck right there in your circle are perfect people. If I were younger, MUCH younger, I would be hitting up your DM myself but alas, I'm old now and can't climb a set of stairs let alone hiking up Wyoming's mountains haha. You got this honey, chin up <3
Oh and aaayyyeeee, RANCH IN THE KILLA”CITY (Kansas toto)” for people that aren’t bred in Johnson County Kansas, I know your mom will love it in Kansas...⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
Good luck babz
I love the dogs! So cute!
You should hire andrew ⭐⭐⭐⭐that would be awesome for him to work with you💞💞💞💞💞💞 he seems like a great trustworthy person from what i see in Shane's videos.
I've been looking for a job for a long while. I've been really wanting a permanent job so badly. I have a associate's degree in business and working on my bachelor's degree in business. I have done some temp jobs but they always die down after a small amount of time Or they are just done with temp workers and changing things. 😥😭
Sad changes also not the right ones! Get rid of jay if you wana improve yo life , make people see that you changing for good and start by throwing the real trash out that is hair by jay
The Hair I’m Livinggggggg 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
You will be fine all will fall into place for ya have a great weekend.
Less unforgiving *
Hi Jeffrey! I would love to be your camera man. Message me and I'll send you my info
Comment section finely manicured...
Nothing like trying to film with those darn toddlers around , lol .... Wish the Best for Maddie & Chris ... Jeffree ..... please please come out with summer shorts/spandex and tank tops ..... it’s going to be a hot one in Wyoming !
Awwww I have missed Jeffrey. He seemed a little different... Hope he is really ok. We love you Jeffrey.. Hurry back. !!!!
Yea def no tea there...
Me da flojera verlo Resuman porfa
Love you Jeffree... cheers 🤟🏻
Jeffree what an amazing friend you are and what a huge step to take I personally believe you have grown in so many ways and may just be a subscriber but can I just say how I am personally so proud of you and the way you have taken it with great stride!!! I will always be here and I will pray for you!!!!
This reminds me of a parent trying to have a serious conversation with a friend and the children are all close by and in the background play fighting and making a ruckus... only its Star trying to have a serious convo with us and his little fur children are all over the place lol
If there is an afterlife, please let me come back as one of your Pomeranian's   I hope you're doing alright dude!
Watching your videos helps. You bring back some normalcy into my life. So thanks.
The next person to film for Jeffree is going to be SO LUCKY. I'd love to work for him..😊🥰
What huge changes! All the best to Chris and Maddie, and lots of love to you Jeffree. I hope this opens up some great good new creative initiatives for all of you. 💕
Wish them the best. Positive vibes your way.
This is the video we all needed and have been waiting for 💙 when one door closes another on opens!! 100000% greater things are coming love you queen
God bless you Jeffree love you your Fan Opal Franks
Maddie has been gone for what seems, months. Maddie recently mentioned/wrote on her live, in passing, that her life was turned upside down. That doesn't sound like it was by choice. I feel like something is missing. Regardless, glad to hear the bears are healthy.
i love you
I wish them the best & I’m also desperately hoping this pink hair means a Jeffree pink trunk palette cuz I need that!
I love you jefree ❤️
lord yas im praying for you shine my queen god speed u beautiful soul :*
I just want a job taking care of your adorable dogs 24 /7 I am heart broken for you but I am a true believer God won't give you more than you can handle your tuff as nails and will find some amazing people
Hi Jeffrey CONGRATULATIONS to Chris and Maddie and they've had a phenomenal teacher working with you. Please be careful who you choose to fill their rolls and you will continue to be GREAT take you time and we'll be here 💜💜💜💄💄💄
I feel bad for Jeffree! If i had to bet, i would honestly say its money related. I know i know, he has made millions BUT he spends millions too! His channel is getting hardly any views anymore so there goes that huge income stream and with the drama and covid slowing the need for ( his )  makeup, I would say his JSC sales are in the toilet as well compared to waht they were. ( consider a few weeks ago, his palettes we BOGO and what brand would do that unless they needed to drum up fast money? Yes, i got 4 haha ) But with his new houses, monthly overhead and everything else, I say he was burning through more then he was making so could not afford those high monthly salaries anymore and that is OK! Those long time emloyees were by now making large monthly salaries that they deserved and its a lot for anyone. Covid has f'd us all in the bank accounts and Jeffree is human and was NOT expecting a freakin pandemic like us all. Stay strong Jeffree! I know i shouldnt but I will keep buying your products and I watch all your videos. You will get through this and if i am wrong and its not money related, I apologize ! Love you boo!
you had me thinking a dog died😭😭
I wish Maddie and Chris the best! I'm wishing them well. Hopefully they enjoy learning from more people then Jeffree. The memories will always be saved. Maddie will hopeful be Maddie Lynn no matter what to jeffree. And Chris will hopefully be "What do you think Chris" to everyone. Enjoy the new chapter of your lives Chris and Maddie :)
Yes king! We love self growth, I love that it you made this video. It made me realize that we or I don’t stop to thank the people around me and in my life. I’m going to let the good people in my life know how important they are to me and how thankful I am to have them. Love ya Jeffree, I was glad to see this video wasn’t about you leaving YouTube!  I had to come back and say, this video just made me feel good. It was wholesome and just sweet.
Who’s he kidding with that “oh I set my own camera up”... nice try I get what he was going for
Not even Japan could handle this hair.
How is this even relevant...  😳
Jeffree!! I'm 25 years old girl in Sweden. And I'm graduating from film school in June and I would love to work for you so please give me a chance! ❤️❤️
Haaaaaaa
Why not get Andrew to fim for u now!
Best news 👏👏👏
We Love You Christian We Love  You Maddie!  Thanks for for everything you have done for Jeffree and us his "fans" we are going to miss you!! An end of a glorious era and the beginning of many more magical endeavors! Love and Light everything is going to be alright Jeffree xx  ❤🧡💛💚💙💜🤎🖤
I. Can. See your. Wewe
OMG I ALMOST HAD AN HEART ATTACK THINKING THAT JEFFREE IS LEAVING YOU TUBE LOL!!!! DEAR JEFFREE LYNN EVERYTHING WILL BE OK DON'T WORRY... YOU'LL FIND RIGHT PERSON TO WORK WITH YOU. YOU ARE AMAZING AND I LOVE YOU SOOOO MUCH!!!!💖😘💖😘💖😘
His laugh is so contagious, can’t wait to see what the future holds woot woot
I'm sorry part of your wall has fallen, but the patches will be just as strong. ❇💜❇ You're living my dream with your Wyoming ranch...this old lady wishes you the peace and happiness I always thought I would find there. Watch a sunset for me. 🙂
I love the fluffy black dog just chillin.
My husband and I have our own company and I totally empathise when employees leave. So many emotions... You just have to be so happy for them and hope that they look back at their time with you fondly
👏👏😢😢
Aw, i know its hard sweetie. And to have not one but 2 drastic change s it has to b very very hard on u. Whoever ends up fillin in the voids are so lucky to have a chance to b around u because u really are a wonderful person .
I'm sad for you, Jeffree. You'll get some good people, I know it.
The moment Jeffree turned on the cam himself, I already knew its about Chris but its okay! 💪🏻❤
I can't believe, I'm just seeing this post. Jeffree, when you put a title like that puts people in panic but it's sad to see them go but good to see Maddy and Christian achieving there goals🙆
Best of luck to both Chris and Maddie! 2021 is the year of change and growth for everyone!   “We didn’t come this far just to come this far.”  ———Mike “The Situation” Sorrentino
You’re leaving 😀
Please don't go Jeffree I love the way you do your makeup and I am your fan and would like to be your friend much love from the bottom of my heart
Seriously love you and your energy sooooo much! You are so strong and you got this sis. You literally have OVERCOME everything that has been tossed at you. I have no doubt in my mind you will continue to grow. Best of luck for all to come ✨🥰
Let me drop everything and move in with miss star🥰 imagine how amazing his next assistant will Be.
omg... i literally was thinking abt you to didn’t know i was abt to bump into this video.
jeffree star, the baddest most strongest bitch i know. you got this girl! we love you so so so much and take all the time you need!! ❤️❤️
Just remember YOU GOT THIS - Thats all you need to know! Hugs ox 😘
I understand they both want to move on but everybody keeps saying he lost them but if they are good friends you don't ever lose a good friend he just lost them as employees. They will always be in his life as good friends. That he should be thankful for
I thought that Maddie left a long time ago??
Omg I’m newly unemployed just finished my internship hire me! I’ll be the new Maddie omg I’d die
And that’s on being a bad bitch!!!!!
All the best Jeff... you are back.... congratulations.... you can do it💪
Everyone left him cos he a monster
Hire me. Bored an looking for something new. paint me pretty if you dare .
wait so we can get rid of the camera man and assistant but not ur hair stylist??? hmmmm
Love you Jeffree 💕
Saying goodbye......a video of Donatella nesting and being adorable AF........ammi right🤣🤣🤣
This is so dramatic 😂so extra and fake 😂💀
All the best to Christian and Maddie. I know you will miss them. Best of luck finding new people. I can’t imagine what it’s like trying to find people to fill their shoes. Be careful and stay safe!
Jeffree can't i work to you as a PA plssssss I'm from philippines love you so much your so strong plssss hired me I need a job
time to call andrew
Please hire me
And suddenly he realises he doesnt need a giant castle to live in...
Im looking for a job and im willing to be a amazing assistant due to pandemic its really effected my life ame dont wanna loose my car.
Prayers and Positive energy Love ya Sis
Bye
who else was not listening and watching the dogs
The title is all dramatic 😆
Why y’all comment as if Jeffree doesn’t have feelings and miss/love people and those he shares his life with? I mean, you say he shouldn’t because of money/success... which isn’t the point here. It’s so difficult for people with his kind of status to open up and people change. He’s been going through it! He’s legitimately attacked everyday and the closest people are growing out from him or hey, why not we all just listen to what he’s saying and STOP putting words/emotions/intentions into his mouth... let him speak his peace so he can live his own life and get himself happy enough to do what we all fell in love with - drinking his redbull, showing up gorgeous, and living his life!!! Bringing us makeup reviews and fabulous destinations with his amazing Pomeranians and family!!! 🌹🌹🌹 SO much love for Jeffree Lynn ❤️❤️❤️ (I hope you’re nails heal soon Jeffree xoxoxo Love watching your videos! I have Faith that the right people fall into your life that’ll help bring you back to us! And yes, please, mascara!!!! 🔥 maybe some mango butter THC body cream?!?! 😉😉😉 Just an idea! The way your line has the amazing smells they do I bet if you made more skin care, it’d melt my heart ❤️❤️❤️ and this mama needs a little something to warm her up by Jeffree Star 💫)
I would like to apply for the personal assistance role 🥺🥺🥺🥺😂   If only ....
I admire your sentiment and for being supportive of your dear friend, and I am so on board with being a bit skeptical 🤨 on trusting your personal life,space, and protecting yourself and your loved ones. I pray for peace and Gods hands as you move forward. We miss you on you tube as Twitter and going fans only to get paid is such a selfish move on some influencers.. when so many don’t have the extra money 💴 to do that. I follow you on snap and YouTube diligently.and I thankyou for loving your fans as much as we love you, you are a wise person and have so much wisdom and truth and loyalty in life and in friendships. And that my friend is hard to find. I pray for peace prosperity and loyalty and trustworthiness. Where one door closes another one opens, but like you said beware because there are wolves in sheep clothing. And whenever you post we will be here..⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️🦋🥰☘️✌️❤️🎸
i hope you find more good people like maddie and chris jeffree <3 i know youlll miss them but since youre friends theyll probably keep in contact, its sweet what you have with them, you even made sure there was room for them in your home,  good luck chris and maddie, rise to the stars ^_^
Let me volunteer and if you’re satisfied with my work ethics after three months. I’m offered the position I applied for.
Good.
Not hearing a thing you said, watching the pups, drooling over their cuteness!!!! I was playing with them in my head lol
Yes bringing new people to our lives is dangerous you need to surround yourself with real people and if they're in your circle they ain't I hope you find good people to help you.
I’m so proud of you. You have come along way and could not be more proud of you!
He wants to take the vax.  Start looking into what that thing has in it.  The mRNA (cloned dna) and nanotechnology did it for me.
I’m almost 40, I hate people and I’m ocd. I’m down if you need a new assistant 😂😂😂
I feel like everything happens for a reason and great things to come Ily u are a person I really look up too ❤️❤️❤️ keep being you please
I was so scared you were done with youtube!! Thank god I was wrong 💜
You should choose Andrew❤️ “are you filming?”
Love you I hate that James Charles does this to you and get away with it I hate it
He is just losing subscribers  But guys don't unsubsribe him !!
Omg if you ever come to Florida I got youuu!! Always been a following and cant wait to see whats next!! And you know us southern peeps are loyal!  Best of luck! I can only imagine what lengths you have to go thru😬😶😲💜💚💛❤
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
i will puppy sit your dogs for FREE with benefits!!!😁👈
:( chris, what do you think? :(
LOL and now the dogs are wore out
What about Nathan's younger brother? Didn't he do some cool filming with Jeffree? Or would that be awkward :/
Jeffree you have been through alot and alot of loss as well. So you probably won't see this comment but I just want ask if you are ok? Are you good? I'm sending you virtu hugs and absolutely love you and respect you.  I just want you to be happy because you always make us happy. Much love to you! Again how are you doing? ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😘😘😘😘😘😘
I love jeffree i dont hate u. But acting and trying to come back like no shit happened gives me goosebumps how cold are we honey !!!
🥲😍😍
I'm waiting for your skin care line
i can be your new camera girl
Oh lord I thought one of the dogs died ...or even worse I thought maybe a family member passed ....this is click bait with a twist.
Wait, did u just turned on ur ad sense?
Please have Andrew Siwicki as your new videographer 💕👌🏻
Wishing everyone the best of luck, love and life as they explore new paths!  Thanks for the update!
the fact he thinks we assume there was tea, drama or gossip probably means there was
This honestly is so sad. Everyone is human you guys, and sometimes we have to look beyond the bs & actually at the person’s heart. Sorry Jeffree 🥺❤️
You had me when u mentioned Covid and them u mention Chris ! Omg . For the moment I thought, no Chris.. no... :)))
we are gonna miss the voice behind the camera ahhhhhhhhh best wishes chris come back and visit
Hire me!!!
Boooooooring.....Chris was everything tho. This video is such a set up, the music, the “looking at the opposite camera on opposite frames” maybe just an excuse because his content and all this drama......umm stagnant much?
If there is no drama between with you and Maddie why did you guys unfollow each other. I wish that was addressed because i don't think you are being honest. If it was a clean break unfollowing each other doesnt make sense.
i love maddie and christian nooo!😭💗
He does the most 💀
I just love u! Your so adorable🥰
I’ll volunteer
This is just so sad 😭 JEFFREE LITERALLY LOST TWO OF HIS MOST LOYAL EMPLOYEES. So much change 2021😭😭😭
I just love u! Your so cute 🥰
Jeffree posted, I smell a launch coming....
Absolutely love it when you can do videos like this. I have so much respect for you Jeffrey & who you are, what you do. You're only human & I feel ppl forget that 💜💜
We love you jefee❤we are always with you👍
Just wondering ...if there’s no tea bet him and Maddie, why did they unfollow each other in IG?
Jeffree Lynn, I'm so proud of you. CV19 and the Age of Aquarius have been an Age of Upheaval. I knew it was coming but I didn't anticipate just how challenging it would be... and I've had it relatively easy. I suppose it was naive of me to not expect this but honestly how could we?? We are all being challenged, we are all growing and we all know growth is rewarding but can be painful. Breathe, Be Kind, Be Patient - with yourself and with others, and Remember to Love. Love Others and Love Yourself. And to the JSC fanbase and family... let's not start unnecessary rumors. Let folks grow in Peace. Let's not make this into a scandal. It's not. It's young people making their way in the world. Things change. Peace, Love and Positive Karma to All!!
Yes Puppy Palette! "FURocious"!
I can't wait that Jeffree notice me and add to his PR list🙂❤️ just kidding🤣
🙋‍♀️..... me @Jeffree
Who else thought that he was quitting YouTube by then thumb nail and the title
Once you fall off the world with no videos on YouTube for us only YouTube people who follow I stopped watching. So find someone and be here for us instead of thinking of yourself so much lol jk. But fr fr We need content fr so get with it. Be careful for your new person to do your videos! All I got to say
I'll take Maddie place Jeffee Star hehe I'm sending you my love and prayers 💖
Thank you for being so real and honest ❤ sometimes change is difficult, but you have grown so much in the past year ⭐
Love you!
You know damn well he made them sign a contract years ago where they cant speak on him of he will sue
Best of luck miss jeffree 💋💋💋💋
Hey from GA, I feel for you l know you go throw stuff but I don't pay attention to that. I love your videos stay strong you know who really love you for you. People come in your life when your not looking for them. Never give up.
I miss your videos! specially the ones with Shane. I remember watching your last series with my boyfriend while after a long day of work and just relax. can't want to see more of you guys! love y'all ❤️
what the fuck is this
You can’t say good bye  Gay rights in San Jose CA always needs Jeffree Star!
You got this jeffree!!!!!!! Its all going to be okay!!!!!
I enjoy watching you. Just keep it real. We're on here talking about your video ographer leaving you and it's a big change but it's not about you.. for a moment.
im sorry i just couldnt keep my eyes off the dogs, so cuteee!
:( noooooo CHRIS AND MADDIE NOOOOO
I just can't with his hair lol...it reminds me the of curlers my mother used to put in her hair
I honestly thought from the title that jeffree was telling us he was ending the channel 💔
Bye!
It will all work out. People grow and move on to new adventures. Good luck to them. Great video
Jeffree just start a vloging channel please you would do amazing at it 🤩
You need to fix yourself! People keep leaving your life!
All the dogs have a nap attack at the same time...lol. Good luck chris & maddie. Its a new chapter in everyones life. Not the end, just another beginning.
Good luck, Chris and Maddie, wherever you end up! You guys will kill it, no matter what you end up deciding to do next.
I thought he was going to quit YouTube... Like nobody cared about the editor?? 😆 The click bait...
No matter what is said I truly wish you the best Jeffree I love you and all positive vibes and prayers your way I still think You are an amazing person and makeup artist creator etc💜💅
When I tell you I click this fast I mean I fucking CLICKED IT
That foundation looks amazing
Camera guy was good.
Jeffree being a dog mom while the pups talked smack behind him because he was trying to work was the sweetest realistic thing he's done for a while. I love it.
I am so sad for you but happy too!!  It has to be hard but you will survive and thrive!! Red Bull gives you wings gurl
I thought you were quitting YouTube, so glad you aren’t. It’s sad to see Christian and Maddie go and it’s understandable that you need sometime to make a few changes.
Jeffree that spot on your knee needs to be tattooed. Lol
When is the March mystery boxes coming out
The lightning in that room is incredible!! You look beautiful!!
Need any chemical engineers for JSC? I graduate and there is nothing in my state. 5 years of stress and agony to finally get my bachelor's only for no one to be hiring. So hooray for student debt stress
Jeffree ~ Thankyou for being unapologetically authentic ♥️ you inspire me.  Good luck on your search.  I’m in CA but have a family.  Much love sweetpea 😘
These pups! The left one so chill !
i wish not traveling & no meet and greets were my problems lmao
The hair made me click ngl
I hope next video whole be some good one ☺️
Just quit my job. 10 years management experience. I’m ready,
I will be your film guy 😍😛 Where can I apply?
not me thinking his hair was in rollers this whole video
I completely agree with you "bitch I know I'm strong but... it's been a lot". I feel exactly the same
Trying to listen to his announcement....but it’s so hard with Donatella play fighting with the other dogs in the background. She’s SO ADORABLE! ❤️🐶🐕🐩❤️
your dogs are so funny in the backround lol
Wow that's alot
Omg so much change. But change is good. personal assistant is not on my resume but great at customerservive dm me I’ll let you shape me mold me to be the best personal assistant that I can be
Good luck with everything!!
I loved Maddie and Chris...
Remember another year
Everything will be fine jeef ❤️
That hair slaps💋
Pleeeeeeaaasssee come to Newcastle, Wyoming, that would be so amazing!! Good luck to the people moving on, i give you the best of the universes energy!
where do I apply to be the next Maddie 😩😩😩😩😩
Byeeeeee
This isn't an airport you don't need to announce your departure BYE BYE
Jeffree! Consider me for the PA job! I’m from Mass but willing to relocate. Maybe you need someone from outside of LA this time :)
I bought the elf chipotle palette
Boring
Jeffree! You did an amazing job on this video, your honesty and emotions are raw and real and we can feel the love you have for Chris and Maddie through the screen. What a good friend you are to know, see and acknowledge when a friend needs to grow and you love them enough to let go! How lucky are they to have you! Keep moving forward Queen, we are here with you ❤️
I don't remember the last time I have seen Jeffrey without any long nails 🤣
Adopt me for your videos😝
Bruh i thought he leaving YouTube
This is a conspiracy video which goes against YouTube’s terms of service
I hope you are okay♡  *sending positivity*   You got this!
Alot
I feel this type of pain so hardcore.. Goodbyes feel like forever.   Those are Big shoes to fill in his heart & life.  You got all my good vibes coming your way jeffree 🥀🖤🗝🌹💀 much love
Hey, say hello to Chris for me
The hair is so beautiful
Lmao too many nice comments, you having fun deleting comments?
We're going to miss you both of you guys 💕
I have been waiting for 2weeks 😑
You did great!cheer up! Everything well be alright again 😊
So we can anticipate more makeup reviews and less products? I mean, slow down, advertise your current products with daily things, give always and other stuff to keep your brands revenue. Shows us what you use to. ❤️❤️
The fact he took his time to appreciate one of his dearest friends and employees , even though most people would just say “okay whatever”. It shows he truly cares about Chris and Maddy and I’m sure so many of his other friends/employees and I love that, and I love how Jeffree is so understanding🥺 I hope you find someone you trust though.
Girl. U see these stunts u pulling for views?
Am I the only one who thought he was quitting youtube?
Congrats to Christian and Maddie on their next steps in their careers! Big shoes to fill when Jeffree finds their replacements. Can’t wait to see what the future holds and more reviews!
Jeffree your hair is so stunning!  🎀 🎀 😍
Lots of love to Chris and maddie ❤and lots of love to u jeffree 💖❤💕💗💓♥
Girl you'll be fine after time. Christian and Maddie good luck on yalls endeavors. Good luck on finding replacements hun.
Everything will work out.  God Bless.
Da puppies!!!!!!
Sorry, you'll have to tell it again. Can't hear you over the cute puppies ❤
Finally
🖤🖤
My favorite hair look from him in a while 💅🏼🎀
Great tribute to Chris and Maddie. I wish you guys the best🌸 I’m nail tech and organizer so Jeffrey call me I’m open for anything 😊
Omg!!!! Your hair is totally on point today. I really love it so much! I told my husband the other day that meeting you or better yet having you do my makeup is 100% on my bucket list. I am obsessed but not in a crazy stalker way. XOXO!!😘😘
I love that theres music in this video, & I'd love to see more of it.
Thanks Chris🤍✨
Chris and Maddie good luck!!! Thank youuuu ❤️❤️
Who else just listened to Jeffree but was watching his babies the whole time?🥰
Anyone else think this should have been a tweet?
Oooh! I feel you...I didn't know if I wanted to do YouTube at first either, but glad I did. I've taken so many  breaks bc of House Of Borgia™, health issues and other things out of my control that I have never been on consistently for more than a few months at a time, but somehow it still picked up quickly when I got on and would come back so that's awesome😊 Looking forward to coming back after over a year! It's a lot to keep up with when you have a lot of other business going on...some pretty crazy! I have to film my WTF happened to me vid too. As things start rolling along more normally I think YouTube will start fitting back in naturally for those of us who have absent and erratic on here. I'm def missing the awesome people who are still watching and writing to me.😊❤
You bitch! How dare you 🥺🥺🥺 my feeling!!
Change can be so hard but so necessary as well. We all know you will always land on your feet. ❤️🙌
WE WON!!!
I was one of the ppl on the team to build the housing units for the vaccine. We distributed the units to several places in the U.S. and some in other countries. Super glad you're doing great and sorry that you had to say goodbye to some of your close friends. Love your YouTube videos. I don't want a shout out or anything but can you like my comment? Lol.
this was so wholesome and heart warming. i aspire to be like him one day
Bai
Bye jeffy not g4tting my watch time
This makes me sad but I hope you all thrive .. also I’m a personal assistant now😂😂
Aw. And here I was hoping the plague of jar Jar sprinklebottom was leaving the platform. Guess we couldn't get that lucky.
Love you say storng
I love how the hyper ones are in one side, and the calm ones are on the other 🤣
I’m coming there to help
I will travel with you and carry all your bags and help you create your own brand of bud! And my kids will play with your kids all day and I'll assist you in ballin out on these bitches! 😂 ps I have a mugshot wearing your hoodie so I think I deserve an application over anyone else 😂
Wow!!! Chris has been camara man foreveeeer!!!  I'll miss his voice:/
Pls make some Pomeranian palette 💓
Not me thinking you were quitting yt
Although these changes make you sad Jeffree you are such a great person that I know you will get great people in your life again. Sending our love dear ❤. Love the new puppy! 🐶
Um hi - applying to be your new assistant <333 :)) for real though. lol
I love how the puppy is just in the background just playing away lol.
I really just miss watching his videos. I suffer with anxiety and depression and it sounds stupid but just watching his videos every week made it better.
❤❤❤❤
I almost didn't click on this having just lost a baby elephant loved through You Tube.  I'll explain at the end of my comment if you are interested in her story.  As for Jeffree:  The opening shot:  It's a good thing that Jeffre's robe somehow stayed closed enough while finishing messing with the tripod.  The closing shot:  what closing shot?  The main content:  Who is going to take care of these pups if Jeffree travels?  So what he really needs is a good dog sitter/trainer.  I wish I had such problems!  Anyway, I have been following the story of Fenya, a baby elephant that was caught up in a snare set by poachers.  Although she was eventually rescued and given all the best love and medical care one could imagine, she passed away yesterday.  It has been a very sad few days for everyone who has watched her story.  Sending thoughts of love to Fenya, the survivor.
U said" stop"  ... but basically tuck your dog and put on top of the others... sayin   "go on " !  Sorry 🤣🤣🤣   doggi behaviourist here 🤣🤣🤣
Is it just me or I like that in the beginning Jeffree was kinda of a vloging moment It’s cool
I was so concerned throughout the entire video that Jeffree might flash everybody 😳
I like his hair tho 😍
I wish I could be your personal assistant
I thought that you were actually leaving, I would have been Uber bummed. 😪 Been waiting on your mascara for awhile (just so you know 😉). Never let those asshats get you down beautiful.  🥰💖💖
U need a all puppy pallet! With shades of browns/creams ect.. call it “Blood-Hound” 🤯🐾♥️
The thumbnail tho lol
Love u Jeffrey. Take one day at a time. Everything gets better. You will find a way. <3
if you haven't been to Mouth full you need to go eat there! Its in Casper! :)
I CAN DO IT AND IM FROM SWEDEN! I'm here babe I got U!!!!!!!
😪😪😪
💖
So beautiful
Jeffrie you can overcome any obstacle that comes your way🤗😚
That is a lot of changes! I was afraid you were leaving YouTube.....I know you will figure it out!!
I'm so sorry for this. Honesty I understand how hard this is as an artist. I know you'll be OK. And u know you'll be OK. You are strong talented and smart. U always land on you're feet #cat 💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚
I can't wait until you slaughter A brand...sorry but that's just who you are and I love it
There's the Jefffree Lynn we love.....🤗
Jeffree, say the word and I’ll pack my bag and hop on a plane tonight to come help you out. I raised 3 well adjusted, successful kids into productive adult members of society. I’ve rescued many dogs and have been a vet tech in the past. I’m more than willing to come out and help you with managing your life and dogs. My husband will be fine without me. Time for Maddie and Deena to move on to “bigger and better things”! ❤️
Jeffree so happy to see you, missed you big time!
It's understandable. 2020 was such a strange year that made everyone reevaluate their life. I wish them well on whatever they do next.
Hey jeffree I got my package and one of my pallets came lifting on two colors I sent pictures and packing slip could not get a decent reply 😞😞 can I get a replacement I’ll send this one back please and thank you
I’ll be ur assistant and videographer Jeffree :) I’m sober :) I don’t deal w/ drama! I am super reliable ! Dependable! And I love you 💖💖💖💖
Boo fuckity hoo im jefree starr and megan marckle and i hate being a millionaire:(
This was so lovely, a really lovely goodbye to Maddie and Chris.   This is the Jeffree I love, just himself, no nonsense or drama, he is an amazing human being.   He just doesnt let the walls down very often but this is the real Jeffree Star ⭐️⭐️⭐️💜💜💜
Sorry but them dogs in the background was making laugh loool
Omg I about had a heart attack when I read the title of this video.....😳🤭😬
You almost lost it there a few times but you made it through without crying.... but I could tell you were on the verge there a few times. I just wanted to reach through the phone and give you a hug. It must suck to be famous and not able to trust people. And when you do you get burnt. Keep the faith Jeff never stop believing in good people.
Love this! Good energy
I love seeing the babies for this whole video there sssooo cute!!!!
We does he look like Bella Thorne in the Thumbnail 💀😭
Why do i love seeing jeffree in control of the camera? like i love it so much more when he’s on his own filming. he can be in his own moment.
Jeez... the way he set that up, I though Chris was dead.
Love you Jeffrey and we’re gonna miss Chris and Maddy, but I’m gonna warn you on the vaccine. I’ve heard some sketchy shit about it so I just wanna make sure you stay safe babes, it would suck to lose you. ❤️❤️❤️
you look SO GOOD
💞⚘
I honestly thought he was gonna say he was selling the Cali house 😂 like it was too big for him or something
Change is really good, and the only thing constant in our lives.
I hope you remember them
ok bye
When you mention death and then his name my heart just went out, I'm very happy about him, just hearing his voice when you both were filming make my heart ache mut kuddos for him <3
You’ll get through this Jeffree!! You have a lot of support and you’re strong! I wish you and all your team a positive outcome
Sad news. I always loved the guy behind the camera, seemed really nice. I hope their new chapter is gonna be an amazing one!
Oh please I know people that are going through real life shit . Wow smh he acts like this is the end of the world . Lol so sad seeing rich people complain about trivial shit
I am feeling for you so fucking hard right now !! I hope you’re going to be ok !!! Watching from Australia and I love your content ! Keep doing you boo you got this !!❤️❤️❤️
I think Andrew would be a great person to bring on as your camera man.
Wishing all the best for Maddie and Chris ♥️
Maybe Chris could pop in down the road and they could film' My Cameraman Does My MakeUp!" for old times since they never did it.😊
Was hoping the evil was ending, lol.
We love you!!! 💖
Congrats and farewell to Maddie and Christian, may you both find what you are looking for and have lots of success in your next chapters. Now as far as this video goes, my opinion on it.....lame and kinda unnecessary
Please add “Sara Loves Makeup” to your team! Sara does a beautiful job on her own channel as well is PR photos for JStar cosmetics!
just to meet jeffree, i will film your videos
Wish u didn't have to go or christin
I literally thought we were loosing Jeffrey but Goodluck Chris!!!!!!!💗
Ding dong the witch is dead
Jefree Lynn!!! I just almost went into cardiac arrest girl😩🤦‍♀️ scared the shitt outta me
I'm happy for his assistants in that they are making their personal goals and dreams come true and I'm also sad for Jeffree because any loss hurts.
Donatella might be my new favorite! Omg she is adorable!
So why did Maddie unfollow you on IG? Since you want to be so honest
Girl, talk about 2020 being a lot. Take a walk in my shoes. Anyhooo...I DO wish the best for you- always! 😘
2020 has opened the eyes for a lot of people, and their lifes.
This title gave me a heart attack for a second.
Where do I apply for either 🙋🏽‍♀️
I love 💕 listening to your stories and I for one never thought then leaving while I knew Maddie was leaving I didn’t know about CHRIS but I knew it was not because of any drama I knew she wanted to go and do other things with her life. But talking about life I wish you would get back to me And NO Not about being your camera person or your assistant lol I been watch you gor DAY ONE LOVE ❤️ LOVE ❤️ LOVE YOU SIS I REALLY NEEF TO TALK YO YOU I MESSAGE YOU A FEW TIMES ON Snap if I was famous and I knew that these people supporting me and I’m not just saying that I would definitely get back to them you know we have nothing but mad love for you it’s just one itsy-bitsy thing I need to ask you so call me bitch lol 😂 only kidding
He says it's covid but in reality,  everyone  is just distancing themselves from him because he's so toxic. Lol, He's exhausted all connections and burned all bridges.
No wonder i hardly hear jefrree said chris and maddie on IG story
It was good to see you my jeffree lynn..  I'm excited for you and sad. Change is hard but it will lead to where you are meant to be.
Can we all appreciate the super duper good quality of this video? Praying for you, Jeffree. Huggggs 🤗
I love you Jeffree!
Stay strong Jeffree uve got this
No matter what happens we still love you and I can’t wait to finally get one of your pallets with the natural colors
jeffree, i am so proud of you for coming on camera & sharing what happened. you’re amazing & i love you ♥️
I wish I knew more about videography to send you my application
Jeffree what lip color are you wearing?
Honestly Jeffree deserves all the success in the world. Hopefully only good and real people come into his life all 2021 🙏🏼💯 Keep up the grind bbby everything pays off at the end 💚
the hair. it's everything.  the color, the mix match, the hello kitty bows, the bangs i live
I’m in Wyoming! Hire me.
Jeffree is lucky to have his furbabies. My sweet boy passed 12/18/2020. Cuddle those furbabies. They pass way too quick.
Still love you to death
I sense such sadness and emptiness in this video. He’s surrounded by his playful, beautiful dogs, jeffree looks gorgeous with the sun shining in the background...but this still feels empty as can be.  Sometimes every one of us need to remember, we’re all human. We all have done things that made us look like a not so good  person and we’ve had ppl talk bad about us. Just remember how you felt. Even when u were in the wrong. Imagine that but with millions of ppl doing it to you. We all do f’d up stuff! Some of us sit and think “I wish I didn’t do that” and we learn from it. And sometimes a situation we were in gets exaggerated and then we end up looking like the most horrible person when it wasn’t even like that.  Take it easy on ppl. U don’t know what’s going on in their head.
Good riddance
ew i hate this and you tbh
Omggg nooo not Chris! 😢😢😢
There is something wrong, YOU! I suppose you're still hiring that creep of a wig Jay who threatened, trashed and was found lurking around Trisha's house. Yuck! Nasty person you are! My friends, family members and I will never buy another one of your pallets. They aren't that great for the price anyway. I can find the same quality for less and know I'm not contributing to a mean toxic viper!
Bye kween
This happened to me several times, people started to leave my life and I was so afraid and I'm just like "What is wrong with me?Why do people start leaving me?" And I realized that, Life is all about People that come and go. People can go but it doesn't mean they'll be gone forever. The Memories they shared with you will stay, and those memories will stay with us forever until we meet another People that comes to the next chapter of our Life. Sorry I'm just being so dramatic I love you Jeffree❤️
The fake vulnerability and feel bad for me vibes are getting old. This didnt need to be a video? Lmao
I love you Jeffrey!
Can I apply for the PA job 🤷‍♂️ my family wouldn’t miss me 😬 I’m 24 from the uk and have a basic bitch lifestyle.... Wyoming wouldn’t be bad
Don’t get me wrong I know how the world works and what not but no offense I don’t think it’s fair that celebrity’s and people higher up in social status are allowed to get the vaccine before the age group they are in comes around, it was 65 and up but I’m from Michigan and they are starting 50 and up but i don’t think it’s fair if we have to wait so should they unless there is medical issue at hand and they need it sooner.
You are so amazing!! It's awesome how you are not that person that will hold people back. You push them to do better and achieve their goals. You are truly a blessed person and I know you will find the right people. I pray you not too brokenhearted!!! God Bless You!!
Breonna taylor still has no justice and your posting this
I'll film for you 🥰
I’m gonna miss the dialogue between you and Chris during videos 🥺
This was, BY FAR, the realest and calmest I’ve ever seen Jeffree be. Keep it up sis 💞
I love how the pups are all business to the left and party to the right!
This is beautiful. I miss the old and honest Jeffree.
Jeffrey we have seen all you have accomplished from the very beginning. You are strong and no matter what you will always figure it out. Life is about changes. People come for a season and some for a lifetime. Keep your head up and if you ever need anything you know I and many of us are here for you. Take your time on bringing new people into your life. Everything will work out in its timing. 😊
I hope you find those that will build you up! Keep slaying girl!! <3 Wish I could snatch up that assistant position or videographer but it's understandable that you need someone close to you. Good luck!
I wish them the best🥰
now ur  bff shane lmao
I became the flash by clicking so fast when I red the title 😂💥
Thanks again Chris for your time and effort
Bye matty and Chris we will miss you
Love you Jeffree. ❤ Loved the update even if it was a goodbye to two amazing people.
Love you Jeffree!
We like this side of you, Jeffree! ❤️
Finding good friends who can be coworkers is an amazing feeling! Good luck in your search!
I’m gonna miss Chris omg I love when jeffree looks at Chris while their filming and asks him if everything looks good or what u think about this Chris omg I’m sad but happy he’s doing ok and Maddie was a sweetheart hope everything goes well for her too. Jeffree don’t worry you’re gonna be fine just think positively 😊❤️
Why is this so etherial
Okay but where do I apply 👀
Hey girl. Amazing as usual. So supportive of your former employees. But that's you hey. The right people will find you. 💋💋❤️❤️
I love you Jeffree I’m a Big Fan from  🇵🇭❤️
Just because they don't TELL YOU when they give their notice that the reason they are done is bc they don't want to be association with your negative shitty branding (not talking about the makeup) anymore. So, whether you believe so it not, whether you see it or not.... These people just have something you don't, called couth, and didn't want to tell you straight out that's the reason. Sorry buddy.... Giving it to ya straight babe
I'm living for the hair
that's all? LOLLLLLL please
Is he cool with Shane?
uhh nigga don't breathe on me
the hair 😍
This was a sad video but I really loved watching this. 2020 has changed people's life so much.
So Jeffrey is hiring? Hmu 🤣
Sorry to hear this. Good luck on the next 2 helpers.
I know Im a pig , but Im distracted the  by fear of seeing Jeffrees junk! trying not to look!!!
Hi Jeff, my friend, instead of California.. wouldn't you like some crazy spanish living in London as your assistant?...asking for a friend you understand... Sending you lots of love... and remember, a new adventure is waiting for you after this corner...and good luck to your friends👍👍
I remember meeting you back in 2006 when I was 19 and at my first gay pride parade 🏳️‍🌈🌈
Jeffree please I want to be your assistant!!!! Can I shoot you my resume? Like, no joke.
Also... Those hair bows , are they clip in ? Where do I get some ? I NEED THEM I LOVE THEM
I read the thumb nail and I was panicking. Omg I was actually scared
Did he ever do the Jlo review!! But it’s nice to see you be happy even with everything going around
Jeffree I am always praying for you and I just want to let u know I appreciate and love you and I have always looked up to you. You are my idol u inspire me a lot I wish and hope and pray to meet you one day xoxo
Hate to see them go but can’t wait to watch their journeys ❤️🥰

Donatella Lynn...was putting on her own show..🤣🤣..so frisky that lil girl..🥰
I miss you jeffree
Bye bye
I’ve been waiting for the JLO review you said you were going to do... I’m assuming this has caused the delay or cancellation
I hope that you aren’t alone right now. I know it’s good for Chris and Maddie to move on but that’s a big house and this video seems sad. I hope you have someone with you.
I was literally distracted by the dogs the entire time
Can i be one of your employee ?
Can someone tell me what dog is that really pretty one bigger not the new ones the coloured one
You're so awesome, as were your peeps!! All the best xo
Who else thought Jeffree was quitting YouTube ?
change is scary but may sometimes be really good. It’s good that you guys didn’t have a fall out. I think it was kind of perfect timing.
Send love nay Jeffree 💘💝💖 It's really hard to trust somebody this time. But I wish you to find a person that you will trust and love you like maddie and Chris.
Wow this quality Jeffrey I know it’s not easy keep your head up I know we’re all going through it stay safe babe❤️

I love you so very Jeffree and I pray that Chris has an amazing future beyond this. I pray that you will find someone as amazing as him to continue this journey. No one will ever replace Chris💔♥️
I wish I could be there and a professional to help. That'd be a dream to be able to work with and beside you. Times are unbelievably hard right now and I love to see how others are recovering and becoming stronger. I've lost about everything in my life due to covid and am a struggling mom of two, close to losing everything we have left, but we will get stronger! You're an inspiration Jeffree💗
Sorry to hear about Chris and Maddy :( But when chapters in our lives close, others open and lead to even more beautiful experiences :) Love You!

Hi. Where can I apply for your personal assistant?
Good luck to him in all he does in the future
Good luck to both Maddie and Chris! If I lived in Cali still I would apply!
Where can I apply?? 😁
Glam as f*ck ❤️
Talk about a click bait title! Had a small heart attack
I would be your videographer in a heart beat for free. I don't give a shit about your money or wealth. It's a passion and would be an honor. I am almost 35 so I have done everything I need to. I know it's never gonna happen but just know that there are people out here that have your back. 🤗
Christian and Maddie will be missed, best of luck to them. You’ll get it together again Jeffree, like you said your a boss bitch and you’ve built a brand from the ground up, it’ll take time, but I do indeed wish the best for your search for new people.
Jeffree don't care if they think it is drama
I wonder who did his hair.....
Awee he was so great!🥺💜 but hey you know Shane and Andrew?? I mean... maybe??
Jeffree I want to be your personal assistant 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
Had to play back because I was only watching the dogs
Best of luck to them both 💖 looking forward to the future ✨🤍
I’m curious to know what happened to Maddie Taylor?
Happy no bad news I hope this is a nice new start for you and many blessings come to all Chris/Maddie/ALL 🥰
I love when Jeffree filming with the dogs..loooveee it
Where can i put my resume???
Thanks for the update gurl! Keep your spirits up.
Thank you jeffree for finally realizing you can’t trust all these people.
Why am I crying for your sadness of chris leaving .. I will miss him tooo 😥
Omg I wish I lived in Cali! I wish even more that I could apply to be your PA! lol  Congratulations to Chris and Maddie for turning the page and beginning a new chapter to their journey, but I'm so sorry you're losing two amazing friends/employees. I truly hope you can find a new camera person and personal assistant that will mesh well with you and the furbabies!💕
Aww ❤️💕
Maybe Andrew can be his filmer? Or is he off limits because of Shane?
wymmmmm goodbye noooo
Life must be so hard for a super rich creep
Interesting doo there Jeffery! You don’t owe anyone anything really. I’m a 61 year old grandma w/10 grandchildren who watches more UTube then they do. Death & Taxes my dear, only things consistent in life. You employ people and they move on. You’ve come from nothing, lived on a dime so you know what it’s like to be self sufficient. There’s no U in team so get back to not being dependent on so many. You can do it!
I LOVE YOU !! UR NOT ALONE , I know is hard to live this life alone , I’m ALONE AS IT CAN BE , family uses me , friends use me and dump me etc , so girl keep ur head up and focus on rebuilding ur happiness, no one deserves it better than you !!  People suck and trolls are at its best , so they always gonna try to find a way of hurting you. Flip them off , straighten up ur crown and keep on walking !  Love u girl stay strong ! 🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤
I hope you can replace Christopher and Maddie with people you can trust in your life. Best of Luck. I’ll pray some good people come your way.
Appreciate ya Jeffrey, your skills and humour are always great entertainment. Tbh, wouldn't be so keen on trusting the " vaccine" .... Just friendly info. Take care over there yo, shit's crazy in this chapter of time! :) x
Girl take your time.
Best of luck Christian!
I LOVE YOU !!

Wow, Chris will be missed,I remember his voice in the background. At first I though Jeffree was saying goodbye.
🙏🙏🙏
“There is no tea and no drama” LIES!
🥰❤️
He needs a redbull
I would literally relocate from North Carolina to California to be Jeffree’s assistant...just sayin’ 🤔😂  I can’t be the only one, right!?! ✨  Been a high-level Assistant for almost 7 years, the next one to come along for @jefreestar should be GRATEFUL 💕
I would so love to be Jeffrey Starr's personal assistant!!💖
We will love 💘  ❤ 💕 💜 ♥ 💗 💘  always
all the best to Chris and Maddie~
Waiting for SpillSesh to over dramatize this video and do some "hot takes"
#1 thing change is always pain. I tell my customers all the time when a change is happening big or small. Change is always pain but after a while with the change it become second nature and not a pain.
BYEE NOBODY CARES
I know you’re happy for Chris and Maddie and you’re fans are happy for them as well, but I’m sorry I know this is hard for you. I know you’ll remain friends but I also know how hard it is to not have people your close to there every day. I can see, hear, and feel your sadness and I hate that for you. All drama aside you are always giving back and you’re a good person and I hope this year you find your bliss.
I was watching the dogs the whole time
Love you forever Babe. Always here for you. Forever and ever.  Nothing for the best of luck for Maddie and Chris. There’s a time for every season.  Seasons change. Go with it. . God has your back for everyone in your life. Can’t wait for the next chapter. I’ll follow you forever.
I’m here ! ❤️❤️
YOUR HAIR IS GOALS
So happy for Maddie <3, growth and new experiences. The best thing to come out of 2020
Well shit if you need anyone for Kansas City I love in Omaha and I’d love you help you it’s be a dream come true to help you out
World so alone
Jeffree you look gorgeous
Don't leave 😢
I hope you have been doing good jeffree, I have missed you!!! you will always be so fxcking iconic to me and I will ALWAYS be obsessed ngl 🤧 😌 💖  I have always wanted to smoke with you and play with pomeranian or any dog at that! I love you so much babes 💗 p.s. please make some new music 🎶 your so good at it!
Why am I watching this video
How do I apply to be your new personal assistant?
Oh my god who all thought he was quitting YouTube
Me waiting for jeffree to hire me as his assistant 🤓
“2021 I hope you’re a little more unforgiving” me :👀 Jeffrey please knock on wood and say forgiving
What if Shane took over? Like he loves filming but just is afraid of people’s opinions. This way he can still be involved in the YT/filming scene
Hair and makeup looking exquisite...and yet still can't tear my eyes away from the dogs!
Jeffree literally has an excuse for EVERYTHING! Lately every video all he’s basically talking about are his sorrows! How dreadful
You are not alone Jeffree!  We’ve all experienced loneliness due  to the pandemic, and many people lost loved ones as well.
OMG! I’m shook!  I feel like I’ve lost my own cameraman and personal assistant. Love me some Christian and Maddie! 🥺😵
God bless you and remember  God know why he do what he do
Classy as always. I live in Wyoming. Lol
jeffree should every video with “haha im like!”
Mr. Star, can I email you my resume? 👩‍🎓📚  Objective: willing to work independently or as a team player to satisfy clients and motivated to demonstrate strong work ethics for your company.
what shade is his lip? orgy pallete for eye shadow?
I would love to be your personal assistant #show me how it's done
I felt how genuine jeffree is in this video 🥺❤️
Love how Jeffree yells at his dogs like they're kids haha 🐶🐶💗💗
New loyal lovelies will come :) don’t worry
Love ELF❤️
I'll miss Chris so much 😢 hearing his voice in jeffree's videos have always been the highlight of the video for me I loved when they communicated I just love him so much what a loss 😭 I wish him the best things in the world 💝💖
anyone else just watching the dogs?😂
I was watching drag race snippets and I saw the title. I never thought I could click so fast. It's been a ride Chris! 🌺
People come and go out of all our lives. You shouldn't have to explain to anyone but thank you for allowing us to hear what is going on in your life. Wishing Chris and Maddie all the best. They were amazing individuals! Wishing you all the best as well!
king of clickbait lol
I love this channel. <3
❤️❤️❤️
Oh wow, I wish I lived in L.A. I'd love to help you out! Filming and photos is something I've been doing since high school. I filmed a ton of stuff for the school cable access show.  Good luck Chris and Maddie in your next steps! ❤
❤❤❤
are we ever gonna get a “Chris does my makeup” video???!? i’m sure he would do A M A Z I N G
Your and makeup and hair! 😲 💕💕
Lol I volunteer as tribute
You looking to employ someone that busts her ass in the Healthcare field FOR NEXT TO NO MONEY and would LOVE to be your videographer / assistant?  LOOK NO FURTHER! Just saying ❤ I have nobody holding me down since my family is absolute shit and I wrote them off when I moved out at 17 due to insane drug additions and just pure abuse. If you're looking to help someone in the common wealth.... well... LETS DO THIS BABY! The offer is here 😊
I went straight to the comments lmao hi y’all
Good luck Chris and Maddie but will you still be launching the mystery boxes this month as you said you would?
Skin care!!!!!! Please!!!!
The baby Pom at 7:32 “yeh this is good rite here”
Jeffree looks great puppies are sweet❤️
I couldn’t stop watching his new puppy throughout the entire video 😂
who else clicked at the speed of light?
I volunteer as tribute. No joke.
If Jeffree needs a new personal assistant, I'm available.
What I wouldn't give to be jeffrees assistant lol js
Love the hair.
Don't u ever scare me like that again I thought u was leaving YouTube ill kick your butt u ever do that lol and I wish them both the best I know they will do well as the grow in life
Probably another launch❤️
Yes, you are a Boss Bitch! You got this! Change can be scary at first, but we grow - learn - come out of it stronger and wiser. I wish you all of the best, and I know good people will be there to assist your vision and talent. X
Such a bittersweet moment !!   But happy that there is no ill will after such a long work history.   And not gunna lie... i fucking LOVE LIVE BREATHE for this vid vibe, its natural  not over the top, n just like the og jeffree, hope to see more of this! Loveeeee it
Clickbait 🤣
I've always been curious about his other personal assistants! Didn't Jeffree used to have like three?
Sis I'm free.
Jeffree, you seem really honest and real in this video. It's off the cuff and more authentic. This is the Jeffree we want!
Why doesn’t he ask Andrew? Shane’s ex cameraman x
Jeffree could film with an old school vhs recorder and I'd still watch.
Here's me falling into your life. I'm ready when do I start 🥰😂😂
I don’t know why I have been so emotional today but my heart just goes out to you. I doubt you’ll even see this but I know how hard it is to have to say goodbye to someone who has been such a big part of your life. I hope whoever fills their positions in a career aspect fits in with your family just as good as they did.
So happy for Chris & Maddie. Wish them well and much success in all they do. 🙏
Omg😞😞
Love you 🤗🌴🏝
Awww no 😔 Chris was amazing. He'll definitely be missed. That was really nice to see Jeffree being his real authentic self again. I feel like it's been a while. No shade. But I feel like he's been going through sh*t, now he's back to himself again. This pleases me. ☺️💖
I wanna see Jeffree on the Real Housewives.
Our og baddest bitch!
Hair by Jay 😏😏😏😏😏
I was waiting for Chris to leave.
The dogs fighting in the back Lmfaooo
I thought this was going to be way worse
I would be the best personal assistant ever 💎 we both have capricorn moon conjunct neptune
This is so manic lmaoooooo
I thought those were rollers in his hair ... omg I’m stoned. 😂😂
Gonna miss them😭 but I wish them the best and praying for you!!!
Me sending virtual hugs ❤️
Jeffree's DMs this weekend with all the resumes   😳😳😳😳😳😳😳
I know I don’t live in Cali but I would love to be ur assistant and would be ur best friend 🧐
Where do I apply for the personal assistant position. Because girl... IM READY TO MOVE ON TO THE NEXT BIG THING. LA I WILL RETURN IF JEFFREE SEES THIS LMAOOOO
I want to be your assistant !! Or video person !!!
Hope everything goes well for you, remember to never lose hope and keep on smiling. Continue being awesome and fabulous ❤️
I feel like Jeffrey has really been through it losing close people. I really want 2021 to be his year. He deserves it ❤️
Byeeeeeeee
if you need another assistant, ms jeffree hmu
Also wish Chris and Maddie both the very best on the future choices. Chris was the absolute best camera guy ever. Loved him. Maddie was such a great personal assistant...I would give anything to have that job. Wow...love u guys. Best Wishes Chris and Maddie
Man down! I just felt a shotgun right on my chest. The mixt between Jeffrey's and Chris's work made me turn on the bell for notifications, it was so fun to watch even when I don't have nothing to do with makeup. So best of luck for both in your new beginnings everything will be great.
I love you jeffree. I have cool and fun ideas I'd love to do with you. I'm not a youtuber or even a small time influencer. But I find we have a lot in common, yet we do have are difference opinions. I love to sit we you and brainstorm ideas. Your larger then life personality and your energy attracts me to you.  Your exquisite lifestyle distracts me from the problem going on in the world. Giving me a safe haven. Jeffree your an amazing person, that not a lot of people see.
How do you get vaccinated before others?
I need a best friend that I can grow old with
Always gotta have those haters lol
I hate this
I think I see a hurt person. I think people  need to stop.  There’s too much hate in the world right now, why target a singular person.
I love your personality
Wait I actually cried, WHAT?!?! I’m so sorry but I know that y’all would always be apart of each others lives and everyone needs some change 💕 best of luck to Chris and Maddie and to the whole family
I just want you to know that the context of this 12 minutes had already been released over multiple platforms, so I only clicked to pause and comment that that wig AINT IT 🤣😂
That hair just aint it .. the bows just doesn’t look cute at all
at least the trash is taking itself out 🤣🤣🤣
Wish you the best! C’est la vie! ❣️
Who did your hair Jeffree?
Will the craziness ever end?? But change is real and losing people that you’ve been that close to is so hard! I’m sorry for your losses but look at you setting up that camera and making a video!!!  Proud of you! 🌺
Don’t take the vaccine Jeffree!! It is not safe! Please do your research. You can read about all the reported adverse effects/deaths on the VAERS website @ vaers.hhs.gov. That’s Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS).
If you need a new assistant I'm OMW 👀🚶‍♀️
Aww man I can’t imagine losing your two most important employees. Lmk if you hiring I’m out to Cali as soon as you call
Good luck to them and to you finding new people to help you.  Things always change.  That's what I've learned in life is that things always change.  Embrace the changes and keep going to new and exciting things.  ❤
omg i wish i could film you <33333333333
Crying about traveling? You can literally travel inside your own house 🤦🏼‍♀️
Bye Chris and Maddie!! Thanks for your contributions and you’ll be missed. 💕
I’ll miss the “what do you think chris?” in the middle of a review 😄
Awesome positivity!♥️
Let me know if you need any remote work done based in Oklahoma 😇🥰
GAYLORD
ABOUT TIMEEEEE
Just admit no one wants anything to do with you anymore & your brand is flopping 🙄
Where do I submit my app?  I'm serious.
Jeffree *talking about something sad and important* Me *watching the doggies non-stop*   I'd literally watch anything on your channel: vlogging, behind the scenes or even dogs videos/hauls
I can’t wait for the Mascara, it’s going to be sickening 🔥
We will miss them too! But everyone moves on in life. Good luck to everyone on their new adventures!
You are the best, God has your back.
but like, if you are looking for a PA. i’m fully available and already live in southern california.
My cat passed away yesterday. Not from Covid but still. Things are tough for me right now. I hope anyone else who has lost their best friend and is reading this is going to be okay. Saying Goodbye is never forever.
We have your back babe!!! Dont give up! You are a bad bitch!!!! You got this! And we got you!
I didn’t see that coming
How do I become his assistant?!?!?
We need a Jeffree pompom channel 24/7 just of the dogs doing their everyday stuff.
Oh thank god Jeffree said Chipotle correct unlike Tea spill that made me want to rip my ears off and shove it in the garbage can because who knows if they finished grade school because she kept saying chipolte!!!
Man. If I didn’t have two little girls, I would be so down to you your PA! I joke with my husband all the time that I would love that position
Jeffree, hire me babe ;)
Looking gorgeous
Hi 🙋‍♀️ I’m your new assistant, ready to « move on » and would love a new challenge ! *life goal*
Jeffree: Major shifts happening... Dogs: 🐶🥊
Omg, I hope they do great! I'm sure they will ☺️❤️ and you got this! You always figure things out. Just take your time and do it on your own way ❤️
Omg Jeffree you can do it hi puppies I would love to work for you
Literally, Jeffree is the only business owner I know that is completely transparent about transitions occurring in their industry. They're always so worried about looking weak and unstable, but all people really want is honesty.
Hire a nobody someone who deserves a chance....
I can’t Imagine having as many Poms as Jeffree does.... I have 1 and she Drives me up the wall Barking Constantly lol! So to think about my Pom Multiplied!!! Oh it would drive me insane 😂😂😂😂 I love her to death but it’s constant 😂😂😂
Awhhh, sooo heartfelt Jeffree, from your heart. Thank you for sharing with us and letting us in to share in your heartache and change. Love you bunches. Please hang in there. Everything will all work out and be OK. Promise...hugs. so sorry your losing Chris and Maddie. But you'll find other great people that will fit in and be great too k. Much love and prayers 🥰🤗🥰😍
Good to see all types of people changing and growing.
Hire me! I live in Los Angeles and a Video editor!
Tbh since thatveganteacher has a youtube channel I thought you were gonna say something about her using you as an example of some sort, and I thought you were quitting as many MANY people might've. They will be missed but lord knows they won't be forgotten. May they find excitement in their lives.
He probably quit because you never post on here anymore
I love you jeffree 🥺❤️
No  please 😱😨😰😨😨😱🥺🥺😢😢😭😤😭😢😢🥺
"There's no gossip, no T, no drama" haha Oh girl, there's tons, you're just not willing to face it haha.
Super
Loved you for years ,,, nothing changing here!!! And the hair!!! Luv it!!!😜😍
Jeffrey: my life is hard. I get the covid vaccine in 3 weeks..us front line workers 😒...
We love to see you and we we're ready for your next level.  Just please be sure to take us with you, Doll! ❤️❤️❤️👸🏼
Most of us have had to take a step back after this past year and reevaluate your lives. Props to Maddie and Christian for growing into their next chapter. As will you. Take this from a 52 yr younger brand new college student who is also starting a new business after the fallout from my old career left me jobless. Just picking up my big girl panties and changing my narrative!
losing a true friend hurts the most than losing the fake one.
Look how HAPPY Ur Babies Are 💞🍥💞🍭🍥🎠
I thought he was quitting youtube 🙄🤚🏻
I volunteer to be the new Maddie!
hire andrew 😭
I feel like Chris & Maddie wanted to leave the toxic energy we all keep hearing about.
You deserve a good circle of people you can trust and depend on. I hope you find someone that can fill the void that’s been left behind.  Bless the two that have left, and bless you for letting them into your life.
I can't wait till I have more Jeffree Star videos in my life!!! YESSS!!!!!  LOVE YOU JEFFREE STAR! YOUR #1 FAN  <----- RIGHT HERE!!!!!
I have no life so I’ll go anywhere and do anything 😅 for minimum wage.
Please do this type of video more often. And show us your home Reno processes, please!
Nooo Chris and Maddie :((
I know people gonna talk shit regardless, but i loved this video. It was so up close and personal and raw. I dug it. Good for you starting a new chapter in your life. I’m excited to see what’s next for Jeffree Star.
Soooo, who did the background soft-music behind your video then?
Andrew Siwicki!
Omg I litteraly thought you where quitting yt
Omggg nooo prayers to you ! And I wish I lived there I’d loveeeeee to be your personal assistant 💗💗😩💯💯💯‼️
Here  I am, falling Into your life!! 🙋🏻‍♀️
4:20 donatella vs blanket  Lmao
I am so sorry, but for 10 minutes of the 11:23 I was focussing on the dogs🙊!  something with a cameraman going away or something?
Love that you share. I really like your move to the country! Well done Jeffrey!!!!
Love you Jeffree,  yes 2020 changed everyone life .keep your head up . You got this .
So Jeffree, this is also YOUR next chapter.  The world is going to be a different place post-COVID.  You're going to be just fine.
Andrew?
Can I be your personal assistant Jeffree? 🥺So proud of you and your hard work! I'm always looking forward to seeing you and your products. Thank you for being you ❤️❤️
Js plz!!! Remember and take time for urself ffs!!!
I’m gonna miss them both so much!!! Here’s hoping the next personal assistant and camera man are as great!!
Girl we love you, and no matter what your real fans will have your back! Sending positive Vibes your way! 🙌😍
“THIS IS CLICKBAIT!”  ...how so?
I WANT MADDIE’S JOB!!! 🙋🏻‍♀️🙋🏻‍♀️🙋🏻‍♀️🙋🏻‍♀️🙋🏻‍♀️🙋🏻‍♀️
Where can I send my resume? I'm 45 2 small dogs can travel, I believe I was in the mafia in the past life. J/k I stay in my lane and can help. I was an RN for 18 years. Please and thank you. Can pass a background
Love the look!!!!🙏
This is the most real Jeffree we've ever seen and honestly I wanna see more videos of this Jeffree ♥
I will literally move states just to be able to watch and play with those babies everyday !!❤❤❤
I would drop everything to move to cali and be your assistant. There is nothing that would make me happier honestly. I think we could be friends if we met at least
I wouldn't recommend getting the vaccine because it's just not ready even though da news cast is saying so but even my friends father works around doctors and they said it.
You should pick Shane to be your videographer.. I think he's available  and needs a job.
To me, people leaving employment is nothing unusual and there doesn’t need to be drama.  Losing your PA and camera person is HUGE and I’m sending you a hug.  Take your time because you need someone that can not only be normal but be completely discreet, hard to come by.  I wish you the best and here’s another hug!  You’ll do this.
I WAS SO SCARED THAT YOU WERE LEAVING YOUTUBE AHHHHHHHHHH
Click bait.... Just saying goodbye to his videographer Chris 😒
Wishing the both of them the best of luck with their futures and all that comes with the new path.  Jeffree I know you will find some more incredible humans that will bring so much joy to you and your life!
Awww I hate these bittersweet moments. Best wishes guys 💞💖
Hire Andrew siwicki!
can someone summerise ???
Omg! You should get Andrew to do it!!!!
Just adore you beautiful soul! Everything will fall into place as its meant to be! Sending love💜
You know, every time he films one of, I think of that one meat canyon video.  If you know, you know.
Man, I hope no products or eyeshadow palettes are being discontinued.....
Sorry what?
Hummm how are you getting the vaccine when other cant? I have a guess at the answer but yep anyways
I wish I had the opportunity to work with Jeffree, how do people get into personal assistant work?
Everyone here waiting for JS to be canceled
Off topic jefree but that wig is EVERYTHING
I had to pee and get water... I know too personal LOL coming from the person gives very explicit details on all sexual preferences lol Made me laugh!!
Me applying to be your assistant/ camera girl/ nail tech... baby I'm coming... 😅😅😅😅💅💅💅💅
I would be your personal mer-assistant 💗💗💗
He has resorted to clip bait a really
DESSERT YOU'RE ON CAMERA
I haven’t looked him up in awhile. Not my cup of tea anymore. Great run but ya this show is OVER. Bye
the amount of times he touched those two pieces of hair............
MASCARA ?!?! I can't wait 😍♥️
Jeffree I'm down to be camera girl! Lol 😆
Good luck Chris and Maddie! Jeffree will be just fine....eventually. New journey!
I love you Jeffree 💗💗💗
I hate to see Chris and Maddie go but I wish them all the best and I wish nothing but the best for you as well Jeffree and your family.
Jeffree are you hiring now ? I can apply 😂
I have never clicked on and off a video so quickly
People forget he's human and not really our alien.
Jeffree take your time to heal. You are Soul sore right now. Wishing you well.
They realized they are not going to have any future jobs being accosted with jeffree they got out just in time i wish them the best !
This isn’t the goodbye I thought it was going to be
Me and her are the same age and super similar back grounds. Cancle culture hasnt learned to take in what lessons theyve learned from the things they did. Amd that's very damaging. For everyone. Them too. No need to draw a line but I actually now....living in a pretty similar thing. People are to young to know what it's like for me and the other me's (jenna marbles, jeffree and other people in their mid 30s or around that. Younger people have no ok dea the stupid world we lived it. Lots of regrets and sadness for the b.s. we use to think was ok amd normal. Mental illness sucks too
Miss you!
The Lonely Doll
That was nice 👍
If you would like me to film you! Hire me I’m from California as well. ❤️ I would be so excited to follow you and your life as you are inspiring. 😊
Pink hair, pink palette please please please
*lives in Los Angeles* ... *needs job* ... *is cosmetology student*... 👀
That was nice 👍
I heard JSC is going downhill and he is losing revenue and his company is hemorrhaging. Hmmmm!!  I guess karma is a bitch huh?
Click bait 😂 what a silly video
Lol u should go out with dignity... i think your cancelled
You hardly upload anymore! Where's the exciting content. I get the camera person is leaving but a whole video for them really this is boring this video isn't even about u whats the point in it. Content had  been boring for a while now

So glad they're doing what they want, sad to see them go!!! I was scared you're were leaving!!
Maddie!!? Nooo!! Lol Naw good luck to them both.. you can tell they left their Mark.. and did an amazing job!
I will miss Maddie and Christian so much!
Can you imagine the craigslist ad responses if he ever put one out!? Lol
Great video. I think it was much needed for Jeffree more than his viewers and supporters.
Your hair is like Sailor Moon
Jeffree: *TALKING* The dogs: *FIGHTING*

Thank you Chris!
Pls say goodbye to youtube next and stay offline forever! Im bummed youre not leaving youtube.
We love you regardless of how many videos you put out.
I miss Shane : (
We miss you Jeffree ❤
Did hair by Jay do your hair sis? Just wondering lol
I knew there wouldn't be any drama or tea. Your a good person Jeffrey. I hope you can feel happier and less stressed soon. Your doing such a good job.
not him taking notes from Shane and filming himself playing and moving the camera around to appear more relatable and appealing.
I wish Christian the best future...I wish Maddie the best future... I'm sad to see you both go you will be missed ... Love you both
omg your puppy is so cute and crazy just found out about the makeup you did with shane cant wait to get one
So click bait... lol so we won't talking about you bulling others. But ok. They have both been gone months though. You can just tell off Instagram alone...
Still love ya babe 🥰
Did he seriously complain that he couldnt do meet and greets because of covid? my mom is dead because of covid. my brother is homeless. my sister lost her house. Get some perspective. Jesus christ.
Anyone else get scared each time he readjusts his lower body that we will see the family jewels? Lawd
So hard to think those 2 pillars of J.S. will be removed. And he is so right. LA is a sadly beautiful really rough town. He will be hard pressed to find that kind of dedication and loyalty and talent. I will totally pray for you darling. I believe in you. God bless us all.🌠 Stay strong jeffree.💪🍀
This is the most genuine I’ve seen him. I’m so use to him being showy or dramatic.
Jeffrey you are amazing awesome fantastic individual your energy will draw the right people to you we are praying for you giving you peace at this time in your life
JEFREE YOUR A BAD *BLEEP* keep going we love you 😘 and everything will be ok ❤️❤️
I thought you were quitting YouTube.
No crushed velvet couch I quit
Imagine guilt tripping your fans into buying stuff lol
When you get the vaccine be sure to drink lots of water, avoid sugar before and after and try to get plenty of rest. It's knocked so many people I know on their ass for a while now.
Ok but like... That Hair is iconic
2021 you'd like the be more UNforgiving? We're on the right track.
I want to see him launch a black and red  black widow themed palette for Halloween next year it would be ICONIC AND WOULD SELL LIKE A MOTHER   Jeffree if you use this please just at least mention my name at the launch lol
I LOVE that I have looked down around 50 ish comments and only see positivity and love for you and yours!! Jeffree 2021 WILL be better!!!
I would be the perfect assistant for you! But I am sorry that your normal is upside down right know. But what doesn't kill you only makes you stronger ❤️❤️much love and positive thoughts
Hoy en mi ventana brilla el sol Y el corazón Se pone triste contemplando la ciudad Porque te vas  Como cada noche desperté Pensando en ti Y en mi reloj todas las horas vi pasar Porque te vas  Todas las promesas de mi amor se irán contigo Me olvidarás Me olvidarás  Junto a la estación hoy lloraré igual que un niño Porque te vas Porque te vas Porque te vas Porque te vas  Bajo la penumbra de un farol Se dormirán Todas las cosas que quedaron por decir Se dormirán  Junto a las manillas de un reloj Esperarán Todas las horas que quedaron por vivir Esperarán  Todas las promesas de mi amor se irán contigo Me olvidarás Me olvidarás  Junto a la estación hoy lloraré igual que un niño Porque te vas Porque te vas Porque te vas Porque te vas
I just adore u! Love, Light, & Prayers to you!! 💓🙏🏻
Him: “saying goodbye” Me: bye bitch
I didn't heard it all, but you can top it off with some barre now. 😉
Good luck Jeffree.  People come and people go but the love is still there.  You will be just fine!  Love and Happiness to you.
Thank you for not quitting... i got really scared when i saw the title😂 love u❤️
❤️❤️
Ill be your new PA ? Im a very hard-working individual, let me know !!
BITCH I THOUGHT YOU WERE QUITTING YOUTUBE. I actually wanted to cry
Te amo ❤️
That clickbait got me good
As if
Oh he lost an editor?  I hear Shane D needs a job
TAKE care❤️
Damn B fly me out to cali ill be your camera guy and assistance lol
As much as I dislike *you know who* on a personal level, I have to admit those hair bows are utterly ADORABLE 🥺🥺
his hair looks like a stack of pink cash
Aaaawwwweee Were all gonna miss Chris!!
This is about his personal assistant
Please let me be your new personal assistant
I cried before even clicking thinking you were quitting youtube 😭 don't do this to me
You look absolutely breathtaking in this video! So sad for the loss of Christian and Maddie!! They will be missed.
Congrats chris. I hope ur movin on up. To the east side. Edit:: you too maddie. You too big huge wow. Best of luck
♥️💯
🙋🏼‍♀️🙋🏼‍♀️🙋🏼‍♀️🙋🏼‍♀️💯💕
❤️❤️❤️
Always loved his honest input on your makeup! Will be missed for sure he was a good one
Gonna miss him but I wish him the best and BITTCHHHH IF YOU NEED A NEW CAMERA PERSON ILL DO IT FOR FREE!!!! I’ve always looked up to you as an icon back when you were doing music and I really hope you find someone that’s good and not crazy lol!!!
feels bad to have no one hey !!
All tea all shade. Cute and meaningful video until you said I miss traveling after you just got done describing how you are nonstop going  between  your mansion in California and your ranch in Wyoming. Cute video until you bring up how your entire life has been turned around due to COVID (while living in luxury). Have you earned the luxury? Yes boo do you but maybe read the damn room first
This was legit nothing more than clickbait lol.
Oh, and Jeffree... I think you should call Andrew Siwicki. If he were to accept, I know he’d do a great job!
LOVE ***
ok bye.
Scared me that one
Jeffree I wanna be your assistant in Casper😍🤩😍❣️🥰
Anyone who still supports this man is just as disgusting as him.
It's bitter sweet Chris is leaving. He's a great personality as a viewer and seems to be a really good friend to you. I mean he's still around after it all. With that being said, congrats to the next chapter and good luck.
I’d kill to be your assistant
I really wished he left 🐜
Can I legitimately apply for the position? I’m a nobody in NC, but I LOVE organizing, arranging, and being assistants to people. It’s like a dream job of mine 😂😂😂
Take care Jeffree. Stay in a positive place and good luck.
Here come the rumors of his employees walking out in 3...2...1....
I thought you were quitting YouTube...clickbaited🙄 #trisha4life
Seen the title and I just instantly said “oh hell no” I thought you were leaving YouTube..
Hire me I’ll keep u real and grounded
Good luck Maddie and Chris!
We love you , stay strong God will put the right people in your life. Keep being you .❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
🙏Thank you for sharing love! Sending you prayers & hugs! L☆VE  Y☆U Jeffree❤
Donnatella (forgive me if i spelled it wrong) was cracking me up she was scratchin the he** out that blanket. Shes so cute. And Jeffrey don't scare us like that lol
I'm glad his make up is super awesome. Cuz that will keep the Bill's paid. Omg....I'm nervous. Have I not been a good sub. OMG THIS IS FUCKED UP.  OHHHH dude I thought he said ..... awe. Yahhh thay sucks but if hes going places that says a lot about jeffree people older in their late 20s amd 30s get that u change or u dont. Remember it sucks when ur past comes back up behind u and bite ur ass. Wow. This expresses so much. Thank u chris
You know what? I LIKED THIS VIDEO. Felt so genuine! Not that others don’t but this was personal, relatable. MORE of your other style of videos with this persona! Go Jeffree, go! 🙌🏼
I appreciate Chris's camera work, watching your channel inspired me to think about starting my own channel.  Great cinematography and positive energy.🙏🏻❇️🦋❣️
Good luck 🍀 and like you said it will all work out.
**clicks video and immediately starts counting the bears to make sure they’re all still alive** Phew-
Now this is an amazing video wishing happiness prosperity!! And love !! They will both be missed !!
Sending prayers to you and your family
I thought you were quitting YouTube 😂🤔this was lowkey a clickbait, IT WAS A CLICKBAIT😒...but Christian and Maddie you will be missed ❤️
Your hair look like something I see with hello kitty
Ew, what a shit wig. And here I thought you were going away finally.
The respect is here Jeffree Star thank you
Christian never did the cameraman doing my makeup challenge with you :(
Can you say click bait
me watching the dogs fight 👍
Aww that must've been so hard,ppl you've grown accustomed to,parting ways even though it was friendly still kind of hits you in the 💜❤️,I'll be watching for that next review..we luv ya..hugs 🤗
Thank you for sharing pieces of your life with us because you don’t have to!! I wish you health,happiness and peace 💗looking forward to more videos
I read the description and  thought you were leaving YouTube  best of luck Chris & Maddy ❤  you'll both be missed
“What do you think Chris” R.I.P🙏🏽🙏🏽
So what’s going on he’s getting a sex change
I hope the next steps for you and your friends are wonderful ones!
We gonna miss you Chris!!!! I  love you so much Jeffree, I feel you... never give up!!!You have inspired me to believe more in myself, thank you...🌸🥰🧡💪🏻
The dogs are so distracting but so cute!
I thought Diva had died 😭😭
We're going to miss you Jeffrey even though there was a lot of rumors going on and you're having a bad day but you'll get through this I promise we'll be waiting for you when you make your next video stay Strong my queen 👑🌹🙂
Can I just apply for a job?
This is so heartbreaking wtf
Laura lee whoo
Not me staring at your eyebrows the whole time wondering did he shave them again or are they covered with makeup? 😂
Jeffree: Saying Goodbye... Me: WHAT??? 🥺🥺🥺
Am I the only one that thought jeffree was going to say Chris past away, he just came in with such a dark tone
Wishing both Christian and Maddie the best in their future and with alot of people out there including myself are wanting to know if you would ever re-release the alien pallet because I wish I could get that one to add to my collection of JSC cosmetics! I’m in love with the pallets.
You need Taylor King to do your videos!!
All I have to say is 💖
Hola Ola Jeffree why don’t you n Shane go to Area 51 n film a makeup 💄 n alien 👽 video; it will be awesome 😎 ❤️👒
Wow the growth Jeffree has made in the last few years is actually crazy, keep going star lets see how far you can go in 2021
Did hair by Jay do that atrocious mess
I knew people were jumping ship because he lives in his ranch more
If there’s not the phrase: “the last couple of days/weeks/months/years has been crazy/a lot” then it’s not a Jeffree video
I was so scared i thought jeffree was going to say diva was gone 😭
Wait,but like how much do u pay? I'm looking to acquire a job, but something tells me u don't pay well otherwise why would they leave a job from a multi millionaire?!?!?
Who's Chris?? Quit already
I’m about to be 18 on the 19th of April I’m down to work with you and be a personal assistant and travel I have nothing else to do 🤷🏻‍♀️
jeffree I graduate college in may please let me be your assistant
I can be your Videographer 🤍 I truly love editing! 🥰
Way to use that click bait.
Christian you will be missed.  Good luck with all your endeavors! Jeffrey it will come back together.  You'll find new staff that loves you and you can trust!
Omg I would love to be their assistant.  I have been home feeling unwanted and useless by all around me.  ....A BLACK CAT JUST RAN PAST ME
Congratulations Christian and Maddie on your new adventures!  Darling Jeffrey, change is hard but you’re “ The Bitch” and you will bounce back like you always do! Love you 😘
I forgot how much I love seeing your face pop up on my TL until I just saw it
his views went from 20+million to like a couple hundred thousand
All the puppies In the back 😍 also I thought your hair was in rollers for the longest time 🤣
Good luck Maddie and Chris, big shoes to fill! 👏🏻🙌🏻
just imagine who jeffree chooses to be his next assistant 🥲 wish I was back in LA it would be a dream come true to be there for jeffree every step of the way.
I need to get up again but I bet I'll get robbed
Ok, grab the snacks 😩
Awww I love that he made a video for him xxx
So how do we apply to work for queen jeffree
Everyone in his life leaves him. Even people like Maddie and Chris who've been there since the start. It seems Jeffree is the common denominator. All his relationships fall apart. He should probably start looking in the mirror
I think you can totally do your own videos without a cameraman. But maybe Andrews available? Shane’s camera guy. He’s a good one, seems trustworthy.
Time to spread his wings and fly
Love you Jeffree, hope you'll find the right person out there that will not betray you. A lot of people loves you, especially abroad. Be safe and enjoy your time with your closed ones. Can't wait for the next review :)
Clickbait the house 😂
Me not living in cali: "I can move🧳🏃‍♀️"
I wasn't even hungry and that's why I have rolls in the front like the caterpillar on Alice in wonderland
What a nice tribute to acknowledge the videographer, they do so much behind the camera ^^
Well that sucks....damn. Good luck , guys.
I actually really dig this raw sit down with Jeffree vibe
I love your sit down and talk videos and your vlogs, just seeing more of your personal life <3 I know you'll find somebody soon who will fit in the shoes of those before. You're just such an amazing person and listening to you talk just makes me happy haha :D
so, youre saying goodbye to all these people but you're not going to talk ab hair by jay?????
its the end of an era!!!
well he lost Maddie &Chris but seems he gained a huge te4am to manage comments ..everything is positive! this never happens on a J* video
Aw pobrecito I hope everything te better 💕
I clicked on this so fast
And I'm thinking wat if I looked like the girl with the side ponytail on nepolian dynamite and
You know jeffrees struggling when he has to clickbait us.
OMG, Jeffrey, I am growing in so much pride for our country. I didn't think this day would come so soon. Did you know that we are both Millennials? Today is my birthday, I'm 33. I live in Orange County, in the city of Fullerton. I know how you feel! Your hair looked so cute. Keep saying, Goodbye, in your own unique ways. Do not rush it. Do what you feel. But do not hesitate to act. Because, you guys seem prone to laziness at the Top. You still seem affected, mentally, by the Kardashians, Katy Perry, Paris Hilton, Britney Spears (she cannot sing :D! HAHA!), etc. If you recall, during that time, the "trend" was, being lazy. Getting paid to do nothing. I didn't join in with all that. I stayed underground. I am a Hippie. The type of Hippie I am is, a Raver. We partied underground during the 2000's, while the rest of you were having a crap time, pretending that "artisits" like Miley Cyrus, Taylor Swift, iCarley, and Selena Gomez were cool. HAHA, Jennifer Lopez and Beyonce, they were TRULY talented, and old school in the 90's. But once they started making music and other forms of media in the 2000's, they turned in to crap, too! "I'm still Jenny from the Block." How desperate. She IS from the Bronx. You can look that up on her Wikipedia page, still. That song, sucked! She was so lame in the movies, Maid in Manhattan, The Wedding Planner, and Angel Eyes. THEY ALL CAME OUT IN THE 2000's! What a dork! I mean, she IS talented. We all saw that demonstrated in the 90's, in the movie, "Selena," starring, Jennifer Lopez. So, to sum it up for you Jeffree and others, she PRETENDED to be untalented in the 2000's! TO DATE: JENNIFER LOPEZ AND BEYONCE ARE STILL DESPERATE TO FIT IN WITH THE 2000's, Millennial theme: getting paid to do nothing. Some people will do ANYTHING to fit in. ANYTHING, to fit in the conversation. Hello, my name is, Brittney Lee Hill Collier. My destiny is to be a famous, British actress, and a Royal, for the United Kingdom. :D HAHA, and I figured out that Henry Cavill is supposed to be my Husband. That means, his Destiny is to be a Royal, with me, too. Henry Cavill is from the United Kingdom. He is British. He is the Famous, British Actor who plays, Superman. He has also been in, The Tudors (it is a television show), The Man from Uncle, Mission: Impossible-Fallout, Enola Holmes, and, he plays Superman again, in Zack Snyder’s Justice League. I figured out he was my Husband in March, of 2021. Gosh, I’ve been trying to figure out which Famous, White Actor was my Husband since, the year 2011, or so. So now, I’ll be traveling back to the United Kingdom, from Fullerton, C.A. (Fullerton, C.A. is in the country of the United States). I went to the United Kingdom, already, in 2020. Now that I know who my husband is, and that he does live in the United Kingdom, I’ll be heading back to the United Kingdom, this year, for the final time, to marry him. Yay for me, it’s Henry Cavill! :D I’m so excited! He IS super sexy; a real, LIVE Prince. I’m lucky. We are both super sexy and confident. He has a really cute home (I’ve seen it online), and a wonderful looking family (I’ve checked them out online, too)! I want lots of kids. I know how much he values family, and tradition. He’s my dream man. He is so beautiful. I am a cute, sexy, obedient, traditional, Southern, African American female, and I still haven’t gotten to meet him. What the heck, world? Society has been so disobedient, disoriented, purposeless, and in disarray, that I couldn’t EVEN muster the ability to simply fly to the United Kingdom, meet my husband, and be married. I AM happy, that I have the money, and the ability to fly back to the United Kingdom. I will simply, bring a backpack, and hike around the United Kingdom, until I find him <3 ! How fun! I am glad to see my Hero. He is my everything. WITH GOD AT THE HELM, WE ARE THE ONES, BRAVE ENOUGH TO MAKE THIS WORLD TRADITIONAL, NORMAL, PLEASING, AND BEAUTIFUL AGAIN! I will see you guys out there! I haven’t bought my ticket, or planned my trip, yet. That is in progress, right now. I’ll be there, soon! I’m taking my time. I will not rush. This will be my final voyage to the United Kingdom, so it has to go perfectly. - Brittney Lee Hill Collier, Friday, March 12th, 2021.
I’m in love with your hair so cute!!! 🥰🥰😚
Cindy Lou Hou!
I love you are trying so hard to be serious but the dogs are playing 🤣
It would be hard to find a trustworthy friend that records your entire life and.. knows when to delete the evidence. Especially a personal assistant that keeps your private information PRIVATE would seem hard to come by this dude is so gross
Is that wig Hair By Jay ? 🤔🤔
Jeffree what happened to your nails boo?
I’m so excited for them but also miss your videos definitely enjoyed this.
Pöease hire Andrew. He ist amazing #ANDREW
❤❤❤
Being able to so graciously let go of employees that are viewed as so invaluable to you is the sign of an incredible employer ❤️
I seen these and screamed “WHAT?!” In the middle of the DMV just now. I was scared you were quitting. Thank God! LOVE FROM STL! <3
Jeffree, I am wishing you the best of luck with the new members of your work team, I hope that in time they become also your friends and create great things together too. Blessings Jefree!
I can imagine the separation anxiety. We had a nanny from the past she was very nice to us, when she said goodbye, I was just hurting, I cried but I couldn’t show. It broke my heart seeing her leave. Ugh. I can imagine the anxiety. Stay strong Jeffree, keep shining ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
Jeffree What is Going on?  Your kids are fighting!
Jeffree hire me !!!

That’s life .  Jeffree is gonna be more FABULOUS  than ever ! ✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨♥️
It's always hard when excellent employees move on especially ones as close to you as Maddie and Chris  I'm sure they will do amazing things! But it is a loss too , always hard to find good people to fill such personal work spaces !  Good luck to them and to you! God dam you click bait titles hahaha 😛😛
Definitely scared this girl LOL! They’re going to be missed! 🥺😘Positive vibes everyone’s way. 2021 to be a better year! I don’t have to live in California not to move there LOL just me and my chubby Chihuahua! ☺️💕 take care of you and yours!  Much love!

seems to me that this new changes will be a nice turn to jeffree. he looks like a little bit more calm and down to earth sometimes letting go loved ones can be useful to keep the friendship intact before anything shitty happens.  will pray for you jeffree just keep calm and try to keep your charms on point honey
OMG I was so cared! I thought he would say Christian died.

I love watching you please do not stop . I hope To buy some make soon I am saving at the moment, soon I will have one of your palette. Thank you Jeffrey for your work and vision. You make me happy in this difficult times. GOOD LUCK to find good people . monicaxxxx
Im so saddened to hear two great people in your life has decided to let go and make new chapters in their lives however they both know that the real great and true moments will be kept and cherished forever. I hope their new beginnings will be as great and powerful as they hope. And may you keep your head high and hopes up. Stay strong and live your life to the fullest ❤❤💕💕
Do you pee standing up or sitting down?🤔
Why am I thinking that this is actually a manipulative video, praising Christian who witnessed all Jeffree's dirts, so that Christian would not talk shit about him. Hmmmm.
Thank you for being so transparent we love you Jeffree❤️
You look so pretty!!
Do you not get dress in the morning ? Always wearing a robe is it just me ? Cute hair though
Love you Christian! 💕 We will miss you on this channel. Good luck to you and your future, I hope you are able to chase your dreams and achieve everything you set out to do!
Love jeffree
Best wishes Jeffree.....
Girl I am so proud of you and always have been, you deserve everything you have achieved! Much love always Jeffree and hope you find your new stars ✨🤍
i love your Robe
Is anyone else just looking at the doggies 😂
Omg everyone is quitting
Save yall some time cause yall really don't wanna sit through 11 minutes of nothing: his video photographer is leaving and so is his assistant and at the end he talks about having another make up release
I think this is the most real I've ever seen you in a video and I love it. I'm so sorry that you're losing two people so close to you. 💖
Hella click bait. 🤦🏽‍♂️
This could’ve been a tweet.
You made my heart stop for a moment, was thinking u was quitting filming babe . Love from the Cold North (Norway)
Just me that wanna see what the ranch looks like?
What is the status of your mystery boxes at the end of the month???
2020 was a whirlwind for everyone & I’m sad you’re losing not employees but close everyday friends. the drama channels will always have something negative to say! Ignore them 💕💕 BUT QUEEN 👑 I will drop everything, move to LA/Wyoming & gladly work for you ✨💕
Jeffree ur sadness is so evident it hurts my heart:( def will miss them and the awesome energy y'all created but keep pushing like you always do, love u!💜
I love you jeffree star brother bear
Um, hi, how are ya!? I'll throw my hat in the ring for the assistant position 😉 All will be well Jeffree, keep your chin up, we love you! ❤
At first I thought one of the dogs died but Jeffree would've been freaking out so bad there'd be no make up left  on her face.
These comments are almost too good to be true...
Drop the link to your guys first video✨🥺
I always tend to lose people in my lives especially the ones I'm closest with and been easily judged to be the problem or let's just say the toxic one. But NO. This is why I always support Jeffree no matter what cause I somehow relate in a different perspective. When we lose, girlllll --- we gain ourselves more. I know you can do it. 💗
@jeffreestar Do you want an assistant/videographer who only lives in California, or ones who lives in Wyoming or both?
JEFFREE NOOOOOO PLEASE DONT GET THE VACCINE ITS NOT TRUST WORTHY!!!
Jeffree looks like glam voldemort in the thumbnail lmaoo
Everything will be all rigth, Jeffree! Pray for you! 🙏😌 Love you endlessly ❤🧡💚💙💜🤎🖤🤍
OMG I was so scared Jesus Christ
Jeffree star I am going to miss chris and i know you are a strong amazing beautiful inspiring person sending my love to you and your family stay safe and healthy 💖💖
Everyone goes through life shifting changes and those are good. Don’t worry bitch, just breathe, don’t stress to hard ok! We love you 😘
No lie jeffree looks like glam voldemort in the thumbnail😂😂
Awwe, girl it's totally understandable  the impact they're a part of you: co-worker, family, friends etc the ride and die. You have every right to feel and express how, you may.  I hope you allow yourself to heal and do what you need to be whole again and selfcare is now. Always here for you, can't wait for you're review. 💜💎🌸🌺
So glad this isn’t his goodbye
bye sister
I live and breath makeup and beauty working with Jeffree would be amazing
Love,strength & good vibes to the three of you👋💖💙💟💥👊💯Living in London,I like many of my friends - who haven't seen their parents - I have not seen my 93 mother for a year! So I empathise with Chris hugely,especially listening to friend in the USA going through the same thing. I don't think people living in The States really understand how restrictive the lock down has been here in UK? Having also started as a PA, it's the nature of the job, that you 2 lasted so long is testament to both of you. I can't imagine it's been an easy decision for any of you. Of course it won't be the same without the charmingly intimate vibe J & C created, but, moving forward with positive vibes,I look forward to the next chapter of a story that inspires & fascinates. Thank you for sharing it,take care👋💥👊💯🌟💯💖💯✌🙏
The little Pomeranian coyote is the cutest thing I’ve seen in a long time!!!
You're gonna be just fine my love. 💗
Jeffree I’ll be your assistant
Girlll we see you. Clickbait. Hi, how are ya? 😂
Love you! Keep your chin up, you got this & I have my credit card ready! 😂
I really admire the optimism after all the things life has been throwing you... Keep being strong ❤
I thought Jeffree was leaving Youtube 😱😱 Lol @Jeffree I am glad you aren't leaving and will be keeping you in my thoughts and prayers! You've got this!! 😘💖😘💖
Is it just me or the intro is everything. We always so jeffree so professional. This sum different
We will miss Chris! We will miss Maddie!
I can’t imagine all these changes. Just know that you have people that absolutely adore you and will continue to be here for you. Also, if there’s ever anything I can do for you, just let me know. I have a strong safety & security background (mostly aviation and feds) & have most recently been in financial management. Traveling is no problem.😂🤣 But really, take your time finding your new team. There’s nothing more important than having the right positive, strong people on your side. You’ll find them and start your own new chapter.💗
love u always, s2
You look gorgeous ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Awww good luck to Maddie and Chris!
Jeffree: "sorry I'm back i had to pee and get water, sorry to personal" Me: jeffree nothings to personal we have seen ur ASS!!! And we have seen so much shit on this channel. I love him tho we gonna miss Maddie and Christian.
Ok I legit got scared, glad you're not saying goodbye but it's still sad they're leaving, deff wish them the best. 💗
Oh Jeffree..wish I could give you a big hug!!! I feel like 2020 has for sure set us all up to "roll with the punches" and you are for sure the champ at that! You got this and I will also pray for you as I know it's hard to find the "right fit". Good luck!!!
🖤
Ahhh so sad and yes it is scary letting someone in cause you can't trust anyone these days it's going to be difficult but it'll work out 🤞
I was gonna cry if he left YouTube
I got nothing holding me where I am. Lost my job because of Covid-19 and having trouble finding work. I'll be your new camera person.
I thought you were quiting youtube
Remember we’ve all dealt with suicidal thoughts , and jeffree has been through that too just like all of us . He’s made a name for himself , he’s made mistakes like we all fucking do , stop dragging him like you know everything about him .
Prayers and love for Jeffree as well, because I’m sure this is incredibly hard on him!  May God bless you all ❤️
Nice way to get views. More money right
Me: Who is this beautiful immortal? Jeffree: Haiiiiiiii, how are ya?!
You’re not the only one struggling. Keep your head up.
Jeffree : normal couch, cute hair, bathrobe, dogs , no camera man , fixing tripod ... Jeffree is trying to humble himself or is he ?!
There’s nothing wrong with Chris and Maddie wanting to achieve their own goals, moving on and be happy. 2021 is all about being better! ♥️
It’s the growth for me 🥺❤️
Next time you wanna have a serious talk make sure the dogs aren’t on the couch
Wishing Chris and Maddie the best of luck in their future endeavors. They will be missed
Hi jeffree star , I love your videos alot!
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
I’m 2 minutes in but i just wanted to say love you Jeffree. Always will x
Can I be your videographer? @jeffreestar
You WILL figure it, and YOU ARE  a Boss B!tch
Best wishes dear
CELEBRATE GOOD TIMES COME AWN
It was really good seeing you J*
OMG I was so scared I thought Jeffree was leaving YT :O
Im gonna miss maddie wish she was in more videos tho
So what else I’m hearing is he needs a new camera operator and a new personal assistant so....when you taking applications and how do we submit our resumes? 😂❤️😍
Love youuuuu <3
This man is evil personified. He is everything bad about YouTube and fame. I wonder just how different his life would be without money.
Sure going to miss Chris!  Best of luck and prayers for him
Love you Jeffree ❤️
هاي شنو هاي هاي تره غير شغله هاي
I’m assuming you taking lots of time for yourself is maybe a reason  for why your assistant moved on as well. But it’s amazing because she has learned so much from you and you have this beautiful new space to be in on your ranch. Life is always moving forward. You are right, the next thing will fall into your life. This is exciting. Scary I’m sure, but exciting!!!
❤❤❤
Someone out there right now will look back & think, "I never thought Jeffree would choose me!"
I thought he was leaving YouTube 🥲 😪Thank god not ...  I’ve been going through a lot of personal stuff myself and losing people in my life  This was such an inspiration!  Keep it up hun! 💗
i love how he is making a whole video of his videographer leaving.. it shows how he truly cares of Chris
Why do I feel sad for Jeffree he has lost 2 of the most loyal employees/friends. Those types of people are rare nowadays.  Wishing them the best.
What I would do to be Jeffree’s personal assistant 😩😩😩
Holy click bait bish 😅
❤ sending love. You got this tho!
I'm so sad to hear this jeffree I've been a fan for you for years I've seen Maddie many times she's so sweet funny kind I've always been obsessed with her I've never honestly been a personal assistant but if you ever feel comfortable/see this/ever wanna try giving this shit to anyone I'd love to help you try my best and see how i can grow through you i have been vaccinated I'm 22 I'm from ny a business major and someone who loves the literal science of YouTube
Get Andrew to shoot your videos. 😅
Send you a good vibes and Much blessings and prayers for you Jeffree . You will found the perfect 👌 new people to take that amazing jobs . Take your time we will be here waiting for the next video when you be able .
I hope you’re doing fine
He is the definition of dramatic
Screw the vaccine and just live
Wishing them the best 💕 and hope you find the right people to have by your side 🥰
Take all the time you need. Inviting someone new into your life is hard under normal circumstances. With you being famous and wealthy it is so much more difficult. Take the time you need to find someone who works well with you and the puppers.
Omg Jeffree I know this is not the time to shot my shot but are you looking for a personal assistant cause am down you tell me yessss and I will fly out to you like TODAY.         PLEASE help me so Jeffree sees this 🙏🙏🙏🙏
Im happy for both of them and I wish you two the best of luck in  life. Chase your goals and live your dreams thats the way to go💚⚘. And  I would be happy to be your assistant. You can do my make-up  I can try to do your make-up paint our nails and talk about cute guys lol. 🦄☺🦄☺🦄🙊🙉🙈💚 and I love you all💋
“If everyone moves on together then success takes care of itself”. No tea, no hate, just quality people taking different walks of life yet people will still twist it to fit their agenda. Glad to see you back Jeffree, well wishes for the rest of the year! ❤️
Hire me?
We love you Jeffree,stay strong.😘
I will fly from the Bahamas just to be your assistant ‼️❤️❤️❤️
Hey Jeffree i hope you recieved my last message im wishing you all the best xx
I would love to work for u but im not from the US
Not goodbye, see you later. All the best 2 all of you and your new journeys. 💜
This video was my last straw. Jeffree is SO OUT OF TOUCH with actual reality for the vast majority of people and what the past year has been like. This whole cry me a River boohoo so sad for me I can only live in one of my two mansions and fly on my private jet anywhere I want but life is so hard and stressful pray for me.... 🙄🤮🙄
Did no one else get a bit scared every so often when his legs would be a bit close to showing eeeeeverything?!   But fr he looked so sad in this video, but good luck to Chris and Maddie in whatever they do next ❤
Jeffree, we all love you and always pray for you, you will find the right people in time. Its hard to find good honest help unfortunately. I have been struggling lately but you keep me sane, hang in there jeffree!!
y saying goodbye the title? i almost had a heart attack.
🌹Mercury is in retrograde for our system ~ if u need to say goodbye to someone or something ~ do it... it’s a rebirth year... live your dreams... we r only here one time. Peace n Love all🌟🔱🌿🦋🌈
Wishing the best to them. 😍🥰😘💓
Everyone in the comments worried that Jeffree was quitting YouTube, where my brain went "Oh no, not another dog death! I can't handle that!!" Thank goodness I was wrong!
I wish your friends the best Jeffree.  Think of the opportunities you’ll be giving some new folks.  And yourself too.  Here’s to the future!
is jeffreestar with kanyay west.
So sorry, bless all 3 of you guys on the part that you move to, and hope the right people fall into place.  Keep your head up Jeffree you got this 💪❤️
We never really got the “My Cameraman Does my Makeup” :((((( nevertheless, still happy for the two of them <3
I'm ready to come home. Seriously ready. Ready and waiting. #FantasticDanceDuet #JustEatCo #ScrabbleTravel #50DotsAndABulldog   P.S I think I know the perfect ass hat to do your videography.
I'm glad you filmed this yourself, it was way better than the other videos with the substitutes. I hope you can find someone great. :)
Is it me or the vid format is likes Andrew Siwicki which is Shane Dawsons camera guy.
did jay the abuser do your hair looks amazing babe
Only jeffree star can wake up, do hair and make up yet keeps the robe on😳🤣
🤍❤️💛💗💗💗🤍🖤🖤🖤💛💛💛❤️💗💗🖤🤍💜
Giiirl you gave me a heart attack. 😳 I love the hair, inspo 😍 please forgive me Mama Star for being unoriginal because I'm going to steal that hair for myself
Ooooo I can’t wait til the chipotle review 🥰
Loved seeing Delicious in this video! He is my favorite!!!!
Where is diva
Good luck to both of them 🙏
Fuck... I used to really love Jeffree.. and I still do.. but you can just tell he’s become a bad person, very out of touch and manipulative. When Maddie is leaving you should know there’s really a change and an issue.
Such fucking clickbait, come on Jeffree....
7:32 omg look at those adorable little donatella patitas
The pink bows 🎀 of hair I’m so here for it! But fr I’m sorry your having to lose close friends but you will find someone new to trust, just follow your heart and we love you mama 💐
You’ll find people to fill those shoes just might take a moment sending love and good vibes
I would like to be hired as your personal joint/blunt roller
To this day i still am amazed by how hardworking Chris and Maddie are. Constantly living Jeffree’s life is not an easy road. Kudos to them and wishing them luck on their next journey! <3
Idk Jeffree. I just wish things would be a bit different. Maybe you find more time to do some videos. Don't let LA fûck you up. So many toxic people.
❤️
Hey Jeffree, I know it’s hard for you right now but I would love to come work for you, I’m a hard worker and dedicated to a job and I know you don’t know me but sometimes it’s good to meet new people because it can change your whole life and not to be weird but I had a dream I was your security Guard and you wanted to hire me full time and now your looking for people, I even know that’s weird but things happen for a reason, I would love to get to know you as a person and maybe a friend one day, love you and hope you’re day would be better then yesterday💕💕
i quite literally thought he was quitting youtube, almost just broke down
Jeffree I’m so sorry but I’m mad at you I thought you were quitting YouTube omg ugh I’m mad I was sad before watching
So excited for you! 2021 will get better! Can’t wait for your new launches!!!!
For a second, I thought you were going to quit YouTube-  Bish don't scare me like that😓😓😓
🌟 *LOVE YOU*  💓💓💓💓💓💓 *CHANGE CAN BE GOOD* *GOODBYE ISN'T FOREVER* Stay Safe 😷 & 💗 Much Love ~😈🔺🦋
Praying for u hunny!!!
Bye Chris we love u
POV: You’re thought Jeffree’y leaving Youtube
I thought you were leaving youtube...i kinda thought it was a good move cause youtube is all crap and canceling people out of jealously now days anyway.....
Best wishes for both of them! They did an amazing job as assistants and friends :)
Love you Jeffree 💋
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I really panicked in the beginning thinking Jeffree was quitting the channel. Though I was sad about Chris and Maddie moving ahead in life without Jeffree but I took a deep sigh when he said he is coming back soon! Jeffree you make my day. Loves from India😘😍❣
I'd love to "not travel" between all my different homes
Best wishes to Maddy & Christian! You got this Miss Star. Can't wait to see what your new chapters all bring! 🥰
This is sad. What a big change. Hope everything works out for him, sending blessings. He will be missed.
I saw the title and thought the worst. At least everyone's ok. Will miss you Chris and Maddie.
You should film a fun series involving finding a new personal assistant~! 🤓
😭 So Sad to hear Chris is gone.. As well as Maddie!! It be really Cool to see you do a video.. or a series.. Looking for and Interviewing a new Assistant and/or a  cameraman!! 😃 🎥🎬📸👩‍💻👽🐶💯
I will miss them both but I no deep down you will find two new wonderful people to add to your team,my support will always with you and I no you will come back 10 times stronger than before xx
WHYD YOU GIVE ME A HEART ATTACK ;-;
Ok I'm concerned but can we talk about the pup on the right? ❤️❤️❤️
Happy for everyone!!
I’m sorry so many changes make things tough. I’m just glad you aren’t going anywhere and there isn’t a scandal. We’ve had enough drama for a lifetime this year!
Andrew?
My God your dogs are EVERYTHING
Im eager to see the new changes for you and your life ♥🌺 it will be amazing !!😘
I know this is a serious vid however (comma) I need to seriously talk about how AMAZING THIS HAIR STYLE IS OH MY GOSH
I love this setup with you controlling the show
The lonely doll...is even more lonely.
Lmafo "Sorry I had to pee"
ok I will forgive you for the clickbait.  my heart DROPPED and I literally said "NO!!" out loud.  so thanks for the heart attack.  that comment was at :41.  but 1:53.........no...no no no.....not chris!?  are you serious?!  I am so sorry!  that feels like a huge loss even to me...and I am not you.  Im sorry Jeffree.  I LOVE and support you, just like all of your real fans.  so far it looks like 27K just an an hour. but...F*CK 6:19?!?!  maddie?!?!? im officially....destroyed, because I feel your pain so bad.  3 lifelong people gone in a year and a half......i dont actually have friends but i cannot imagine.... if you ever need a rando friend, im here
Sad to see them go but definitely happy for them. I’m glad there’s no drama.
So youre not leaving youtube? That's sad.
No matter who's holding the camera or handling your schedule, the love will always be HUGE! Stay strong, sweetie. Kisses from Brazil!
Shit lettme be your next assistant.. I need money lol
Since Shane is cancelled you should hire Andrew :)
Who else checked the comments to see if Jeffree was leaving YT before watching the video? Glad I did; now I can say goodbye 👋🤣
Thought that Jeffree is quitting Youtube, I’ll probably be dead rn 😭
hubibgyhkbjn
Love you Jeffree, glad your okay ♥️🔥
I would love to do your nails, or send you nails to apply yourself💜
I'm so glad there's no drama❤   and I'm glad this isn't Jeffree's last video
... “But you’re like REALLY pretty.”
LOL Did you really think Jeffree was going anywhere?? And I want those little babies, hand 'em over....💜💚😻
My heart was beating so fast when I saw the tiltle
Finally
Well miss you Jeffrey but always be preparing for your return
Life has been crazy! I am here for the long haul! Keep being your wonderful self!
Good for them and best of luck to them. I hope they find everything they are looking for in life! Hope you find people who you can trust, take your time, of course.  Love ya Queen

Saw your ig Came so fast..Omg click so fast.. you look like a goddess.  And OMG I'm going to miss you...💔💔💔💔 feels like your breaking up wit us. I can't believe no Chris.
Hi Jeffry, life is sure about change and dare I say, transitions also!  I can say I'm a little jelly of your Wyoming ranch!   Happy for you!!  You will work things out, just be clear about who they are and do a background check, you know, to see if there is anything you need to be aware of.  Happy Saint Patrick's Day! 🌿🍀🌿
Oh I just clicked and I’m scared. Biiiitch Don’t make me cry please.

Ask Shane to film and edit your channel 😃
Wishing your extended family the best in their new journey ❤ Keep your chin and spirits up, you'll find what you need when you least expect it ❤
❤️❤️❤️❤️
Big changes, but great things for everyone involved
My boyfriend and I would 100% move from WA to CA if I got to be Jeffree’s assistant. Just saying. That would change my life.
Don’t scare us like that! Girl, I thought you were leaving YouTube.
I literally had to play this in 1.5x cause he talks sooo SLOOOW 😂😂😂
Can I be your assistant? Please give me a chance. I'm really looking for a change in my life and I wanna do this so bad. Is my dream job
Sad to see them go but happy for their next chapters, and yours too.    It's all gonna work out.
Mini heart attack for a second
Awwww Miss Star! I’m so happy that these people are going to move onto the next chapter of their lives! Being a team with you must’ve been the greatest thing to happen in their lives and I hope you can find good vibes to fill their shoes. You’re such a great soul and I’m so happy this video wasn’t about YOU saying goodbye! Ugh I almost died! Good for them and I love you Jeffrey!
Awww, it will be ok. Umm, you're going to make a series about hiring new employees right? Shane is going to film it right? You and Shane are doing good. Come back with a bang. I will be waiting for you and Shane's arrival. Let's goooo!! 🐷👽❤️
I was like...is Jeffree quitting YouTube!? Noooo! 😩🙏🙏🙏 Thank the Lord! Wishing Maddie and Chris all the best! ❤
Was this filmed with my fucking eyeballs why is this crisp
Seeing the notification > Panicking
WHAT !?! Your leaving
The first time i saw maddy in your video was from shane dawson’s first time coming to your pink house, and obviously Chris was filming it all! Time flies so fast, everybody is moving on and starting a new journey. Sad to see them leave but i wouldn’t expect them to stay for the rest of their life. I’m hoping you’re next PA and Cameraman can meet the standards maddy and chris made!! Much love and aloha ❤️
I can learn to edit videos and I have a Pom that fits the naming standard lol hire me
Are they dead?
can you and Shane do a video again? please go to his house.
You're telling me this video was created minutes ago and I'm just now getting the notif??!
I love your pups and I can tell they love you. If I can EVERbe of help in Casper lemme know! It's so beautiful.  Just love and be loved by your dogs and I hope you get thru all this without too much pain. Take care.
Hi Jeffree, I'm  so sorry for Chris leaving I will definitely  miss  "what do you think Chris." He was definitely  great you video were on point! I wish the best for him, your assistant and yourself. You will bring us 🔥 and I can't  wait❤❤
The next person is lucky as fuck that's all I have to say.
Thank you so much for keeping me going every day
Gotta use a clickbait title for the views. 😂
Jeffree, you're an amazing person. Chris and Maddie will always be a part of your life. Y'all built so many beautiful and fantastic memories together, and most importantly, y'all became a very close family. Big hug to you, Jeffree.   P.S. Please, stay strong. You're my major inspiration. ❤😊
Oh boy im going to miss Chris...many blessings to him and his new endeavors.  OMG Jeffree id LOVE to do it!!!  I wish you would give someone like me a chance!!!  I know that this is a long shot and that you're most likely laughing while and if you're reading this lol I'm such a fan of yours and I'd just discovered you during the start of this horrific pandemic.  I can honestly say that I was hooked from the very first video I watched of you!  Anyway im sure you get this all the time but im telling you the absolute TRUTH!#luvmeALLofjeffreestar #frfr       💞🌟 💟🌟 💌💫💘🌟 💝💫💖🌟

Omg. So sad for you. This must be so hard. 😔
Can we start a petition to have Andrew take over Jeffree's filming please?? They already have so much chemistry together! 😍🤩
Hey sweetie..missed you

Awe! Bye Chris😔💞
I wish both of them the best and I just know you will all continue to be amazing ❤️ he may of lost a PA and a cameraman but he hasn’t lost them as friends, I just hope Jeffree that you won’t feel lonely so if you ever wanna drop me a message and just talk about how you are feeling then I’m your man ❤️ love ya

It’s actually nice just to see you sit down a talk. Plus I’ll watch anything you put out lol xx
Aw, good for Chris but sad for us. I loved the chemistry the two of you shared, your comfort level with him definitely came through the camera. 😘 love ya Jeffree
GIRLLL
Poor jeffree. Its hard to lose close employees and loved ones that you depend on.
Thank God it is not you
This kinda stuff just makes you realize that life does really goes on... damn...
Poor Jeffree:( we love you , you’re gonna be okay🥺💗 Wishing Chris and Maddie all the best!  Also Jeffree, hope you’re doing well❤️🥺
Honestly I like the sort of vlog format! Good luck to Maddie and Chris! Hope you will find some great employees to fill their shoes
I don’t care what controversy he’s been in. He’s human and I love him
I was just thinking this morning how Maddie would never leave bc she lives in the house I-
Omg. I don't know but I'm late to this video omg
DONT DO THAT TO ME!!! I almost had a whole panic attack!
Aaweeeee gonna miss Chris!! And I knew it wasn't nothing bad with Maddy people just wanted there to be drama!! We love you mama and welcome growth and change with all 3 of you!! 💖💖💖💖💖
I would love to be his assistant, big shoes to fill but that would be a dream. I’ve been following him for years. <3
I love you jeffree!!! Good luck! Sending good vibes 🥰🥰😘😘
We'll try to be nice to your next videographer... :)
Jeffrey pulls a Miranda Priestly referring Maddie to her next position: “...if you don’t hire her, you’re an idiot.”
Love u jeffree!!!
Does this mean there’s a position open cause that’s a nice job ngl!
And I thought he got cancelled
Wth
Omg Jeffree this made me cry. God Bless Chris on his new chapter! Thank you for all you do!!! You will be missed!!!
Not me relocating from England to be Jeffree’s PA
If your ever in South Dakota, get ahold of me!  Casey Bau on fb.
My city’s in a tornado and sever thunderstorm warning but this is more important than the news. Love you Jeffree!
Wishing them both the best. I will miss you saying to Chris, what do you think Chris
POV: Clicking so fast to see if Jeffree was finally over with drama or if he was gonna comment on Kanye
Awww Chris and maddy:( best luck and wishes to Chris and maddy :) may their journeys come with a lot of excitement and happiness and life and good health .
Hi, I will be your personal assistant 😊
Jeffree there are SO many of us that love you!!! Me ecspecially.. No one is perfect and crap happens but you have changed a lot of ppls lives when it comes to make up and just being your authentic self. I know it's hard being you and things have been very difficult. People tend to forget that just because you have fame you don't have feelings... We all make mistakes..but I can truly say I'll always stick by your side! I NEVER give in to the tea and gossip..  may you continue to thrive and make wonderful, amazing make up as usual. We'll miss the gang but I know you'll be fine!!!!🌟 Sending all my love to you!!! You are amazing!!!!
Wishing you only the best in these trying times 🤍
You got this jeffree. And you opened doors for everyone you let in. And if u want me to work for you I'm so down.
Not me crying 😭
I can be your assistant! I've been running a cannabis industry for 4 years I could definitely run your industry and life. Plus I couldn't pick you out good weed! If you want to check me out let me know. Plus I'm gonna be 41 this year and could really use some savings for my retirement and some stability to live out the rest of my life and because I'm older I don't have all the drama so it probably be good for you to have an older person helping you out. And I am part of the LGBTQ+ family!  I think it's a when Jeffree Lynn
Watching your journey has been a massive inspiration to me. I've been following you since the myspace days and I'm proud of the person you've become.
YOU OF ALL PEOPLE WHO DON'T PUT DRUGS INTO UR BODY DO NOT GET THAT VAX. OMG JEFFREE DON'T DO IT... YOU'RE GONNA REGRET IT. PLUS THEY'RE COLLECTING UR DNA EVERY TEST U TAKE AND SENDING IT RIGHT TO THE SAME LAB THAT CREATED SARS AKA CORONA. U DO NOT NEED A VAX THAT IS A 96% RATE WHEN FIRST VAX DO NOT NEED VAX. 2ND U HAVE A NATURAL 98% CHANCE OF BEATING IT W/O THE VAX. LET THAT SINK IN. STOP BUY INTO THE FEAR AND PROPAGANDA. IT'S WORSE THAN REFER MADNESS EVER WAS. OMG PEOPLE WAKE UP. THAT DNA THEY RE COLLECTING THINK ABOUT WHAT THAT CHINESE LAB HAS ALREADY DONE AND CREATED. COME ON U DON'T EVEN NEED A DEGREE TO FIGURE IT OUT. GOOD GOD HELP YOU AND ANYONE ELSE WHO BUYS INTO THIS NONSESE. THE VIRUS IS REAL THE VAX IS A MONEY 💰 MAKING HOAX DNA COLLECTION GRAB.
Where can I apply to be your personal assistant 😭
I love you Jeffree!!💖💖💖
I know u will get past this and it'll be better! title scared me, lol. sad wen people wanna move on!
If i can bring my spitz dog, i will be your personal assistant until the dawn of time.
Totally get it! Good luck in your search!  Cant wait to see what's to come😊
❤️❤️❤️ sending you my love and support, but girl I’m ready for the foundation 👀
First thing I tought was Diva...
☹ Why does everything have to change? It's sad.
jeffree, please choose wisely b/c the next few people are going to want to collect "tea" and "expose" you. Not many people are real and we do not want to see people leaking your  JSC company sensitive information and other personal stuff. Be well, be safe.
Just me that thinks Jeffree is in peace with herself? 😍
Tells us about the friggen camera man no one has ever known seen or cared about
I CLICKED SOOO FAST & DIDN'T BLINK!
Omg I had to fastforward to make sure Jeffree wasn't leaving. Almost had a stroke.
I love all your many different wigs ,there all so beautiful ❤ and colorful ☺ Stay safe, and we all love and support you Jeffree, your such an amazing person! We are always here for you, may god always be with you in the good times and bad times, take care now ❤🌺☺
Hire me Jeffree :)
I’m re-locating back to LA in the next few weeks. Before, I was in Woodland Hills. I had moved there to start my makeup career, and/or hopefully work for Jeffreestarcosmetics in any capacity. I’m used to going inside places and passing a resume. I realized quickly killer Merch wasn’t that kind of place. Feeling a little self conscious,  I still tried. The guard did take my resume but I’m sure it got nowhere. I tried twice. Anyways. My point is. I know people are hard to trust. Especially with your successful career/company. They’re out there. I realize you said you’re not asking, or putting out and add. You know people, I know that. I still want to let you know that I have a dream too, and I have to try, and I have to start somewhere. I believe in you, and I believe in your company so incredibly strongly. It sounds so cheesy but. There’s always been something inside of me that knew I was meant for more. Like I don’t know the way? I’ve been stressing but somethings told me all along I’ll get there. To not stress how. I just will. I’m an artist. A creator. I’ve followed you since I was 14 and you were in MySpace and I am so proud... to see how far you’ve come. When I saw your makeup line I knew. I’d want nothing more then to finally start my life doing something so meaningful to me finally in the artist field. I’d take on any task. I want to learn anything and everything and to grow in this industry. It would be an honor. Either way I’m moving back to Los Angeles and will work my way up in some form of art or influencer/beauty way. I’ll audition to things, I’ll perform, I’ll be doing it all because this is all I want to do. To be in this industry. behind the scenes or not. Somehow I just felt led to write this... I have tried before but. It’s been a rough past year, for all of us. I’ve felt like giving up on my dream a lots of things but I can’t. I want nothing more in life, otherwise I’d just rather not exist if I can’t try to do this. Anyways. Be safe. Please take care of yourself, you’ve gotten through so much. I’m not even worried. Obviously you GOT THIS. “ That’s so happenannnnggg!” Do not let ANYONE bring your spirits down. Don’t let anything set you back In your mind. Life is too short, it’s not worth it. Be thankful, show love, be loved, be inspired and keep pressing through this. This is just a rough place in time, when you look back? You’ll remember but barely. You’ll be stronger on the other side ^,..,^ deep breaths. We all need it.
Slowly he is losing more and more followers. Im surprised he hadn't spoken about this earlier. I guess all the people are leaving him. I wonder why. You don't just leave like that dude. Like there has to be a reason.
Jeffree, change is hard, we are all here for you. My friend, you are such a strong and amazing person, love you so much. PS: i wish i had half the strength and courage you do!!!
Little Donatella is so precious, I want a puppy like her, she is so beautiful <3
Love You Jeffree & I Hope You Find Someone Special As Your Assistant & Camera Man. Wishing You Nothing But The Best Queen!!!😘🤗❤❤❤❤❤❤
OMG i'm dieing
Okay where can I apply to be your assistant????
Can u give a house tour of what the house looks like so far?
I can't get passed your hair bows.. So adorable! Always love you!
Take me !!! I can shoot, fly a drone and we already met ... I’m from Miami ☺️🙏🏼
More makeup reviews please🙏
You’re in my thoughts and prayers Jeffree. Sending love to you, Maddie and Chris on your life paths. :)
Love you so much Jeffree!! Sending good vibes your way, because we all deserve love in our lives 💖💖
Aww Jeffree, I’m sorry. Change can be so hard. Esp having anxiety surrounding trusting new people. I hope you find the best people ❤️
You made mistakes, but it seems like you are taking your mental health serious and for that I admire you. It´s hard for people like us who are not famous, so it must be harder for someone who is always on the spot. I am not saying that you are a whole new person cause that does not happen, mistakes always stick with us, but I hope you find your own path.
I am so sick of the retail life!  I would LOVE to be the PA! It would be hard work but so fun and informative.  Would love a change of pace and scenery!
I'm really sorry to hear that everything is emotional for you and good luck Christian and I'm glad you are both still friends and  you don't need to worry we are still here to support you and drink red bulls with you and we will always remember him and you film these videos for your channel. Also I will forever watch your videos and your gonna make a really big difference in life so thank you for everything. Xxxxxx
I thought he moved to Wyoming so he could avoid paying taxes? He's back in LA?? Tax fraud.
*We love an honest and humble queen*
We love you Jeffree. You have been through a lot. Keep your head up and you have a good attitude about everything. We can tell you have grown as a lot of us had this year.   With lots of love  Sincerely your fans
I literally don’t care I thought he was gunna quit YouTube which if he did I would have been ABOUT TIME but unfortunately not 🙄
Best of luck To Chris.. Love Jeffree Starr and Lots of Cuteness for those puppy dogs.
Awwww i'm gonna miss Chris,he was one of the highlights of your channel. I wish him well and wow changes are rough 💕
😭😭😭😭😭 your tone and give made me cry
Its always part of the Journey
When you’re trying to listen to Jeffree speak, but are too distracted by the poms. ❤️
I can't wait to continue watching you grow, love you Jeffree!!
If you need someone, reach out!! I'm never getting married, free to travel, have nothing going on. Love dogs!!! Organized as hell and mature... 🐕❤️
All things aside, Jeffree, your wig is STUNNING!! 🤍🤍
Me sitting here wanting to be Jeffree's camera man 🧘‍♀️
Jefree I’ll always love you !
Thank you for being so open with us, I know big changes like that are never easy when someone has been such a big part of your life. Keeping you in my thoughts❤️

God this is actually upsettig. Im gonna miss chris so much. I cant imagine how this change must feel. Take ur time babe. We want u to be the goddess you have in you not the goddess you pretend to be.  Love you jeffree, keep ur head up high my love
I almost faint! Dont Scare me like that :c  Its difficult saying goodbye to so important people like them , i hope the new ones can be as good as them <3
So nice to see how grateful you are for the work of your collaborators and how respectful you're about other's people choices. I'll wait for your next video and good luck to them😊
This was wholesome and I love it, I'm so happy for Chris and I wish him the best of luck. Chris I send you hugs and best wishes!!👋😊💜
You’re lovely to listen to Jeff
I was watching someone do a minecraft hardcore challenge and i legit said "Dude, this video is cool, but Jeffree Star is more important!" And clicked on the video. My mom is gonna ask what this video is about cause she always does. I can tell her what's going on. I wish you the best of luck Jeffree! Me and my mom love you so much!! Thank you for the amazing products you give out!!
I just  got mine
Hey if ya need a new person to film I wld love 2 accept the position ❤️💜 or be a assistant 4 ya......
Damn, thought he was leaving.
Omg Jefree, that is completely true. 2020 did do a number on a lot of people. I have great hopes for you, and know you will build up after this! You inspire me so much!! Even when you did music, your own clothing line, and so forth!! I love your content
You know its genuine when he's not sitting like a greyhound.
My man was like I know you love to be jeffrees assistant... I say apply... but where? How? I’m not savvy in beeing an assistant tho... his words it’s jeffree it’s not hard to listen and obey orders...
Love the vlog format💕
Can any other tati lovers agree we are here low key pissed asf he bullied her off YouTube so now we are here out of Bordem because Tati no longer posts anything. 🙃
Many blessings to Mattie and Chris!Thank you for all you have done for Jeffree  and us for many years so many memories for them,and please bring someone in Jefferys life that will help him,respect him,be a good fit ✨❤️❤️
My heart dropped.   The world wouldnt be the same without him
Hire me!!!!! I’ll be your personal assistant!! I need a new course. I’ll move to LA 😁
Big support to Jeffree Star
I would love to be your assistant ugh one could only dream.
Wyoming is beautiful ❤️
Pick me 🙋🏻‍♀️🥰
Mascara??? YES!!!
Good vibes jeffree you're doing great 🥰
You may be sad but this hair is serving! We love you Chris 🥺
It may be taking time, and he may make more mistakes, but I’m finally seeing a shift. Regardless of the drama, and what you say about Jeffree, it’s great to see this gratitude. We always focus on the negative, and yes he has been a mean girl, but that is not his WHOLE character, he is also wonderfully charitable and giving. But, watch the drama channels twist this!!!
omg
I love your honest emotional videos. Chris was amazing 😻
My birthday is today and i just got home from work to find that my fiancé had found me the green weed JSC star tie dyed hoodie from someone on mercari for a ridiculously high price. But i love it and him so much! Best bday present ever! Love u jeffree!
Where's Diva? You can't post a title like this and not have Diva in the opening shot.
Jeffree I am so sorry this is happening to you we all still love you no matter what. 😘
We love you
I would love to be your assistant! Lol but I live in SC but Ive always wanted to come to California
Je te souhaite Jeffree tout le bonheur et amour !!!🥰 Tout coeur avec toi...💗
That stinks but I’m sure you will find amazing people to work with you. And will be genuine. Plus girl waiting for a Jeffree star foundation
Love you Jeffree, you said it yourself you’re a boss bitch 😘😘😘 wishing Chris and Maddie the very best in their next adventures ❤️
Yano Jeffree... I'm from the UK, love dogs, makeup and can roll a mean b|unt... Gimme a call 🤷‍♀️🤣
Sad to see their leaving, but you saying your assistants leaving I’m like “I think I found my calling” 👏🏻
What camera was used to film this video
Not me getting emotional over this video x
Jeffree,  you will come through all of this. I see you. You are beautiful, strong, and your aura is so colorful and bright, you are a force of nature that can't be stopped. Continue your journey. Start your new chapter. Don't settle for less than you deserve. You are loved. Anytime you need a Mom hug hit me up Gorgeous. Take care of you and I can't wait until your next update.
I'm so glad u appreciate the work of your team💚
Ohhhh you could get Julian Solomita. His work is good.
Did his hair person quit too?
Miss you Jeffree. May God bless you, your family and business!!
🥰
That camera quality tho...
This guy is too much haha. Such clickbait
Love you and hopefully things fall into place soon ❤️😘
It's taking forever to get back to normal.
not christian and maddie! 😩
Hire me lol I'm an executive assistant 😅
Change is always good and I have to say I love that wig
Does anyone know Chris and Maddy’s instagrams?  I wanna follow their journeys!
i miss alicia !!! i know she was your best friend and old personal assistant... will she be making a return 👀💛🥰 such a beautiful woman
When I saw the title I thought... uh oh 😦 who died now?
I appreciated the candidness of the video. You are you. Good job! Good luck to you finding someone honest and trustworthy. I'm gonna miss Maddie 😭 and Chris 🥺
Total click bait! ✌
💗💗
Thank God. I thought something happened to one of the dogs.
I clicked on this as soon as I saw! Honestly wish you nothing but happiness and hope you find everything you are looking for!
Sad but so happy your not leaving us lol 😆 ♡♡
😂😂😂😂 sis did you make this thumbnail?
You really don’t need to address and explain everything, just post when you want and what you want. As long as its not offensive or hurtful. Just live your life Jeffrey! Don’t stress out in that aspect since you already have a lot on your plate.
I pray that everyone will accept yeshua/jesus christ as their savior before it's to late.  He loves us all and he accepts us all that accept him and love and follow his words. God bless us all!
I LOVE YOU
What is the music in the background can anyone tell me? It was played on a video when my friend passed and always makes me so sad but it's so beautiful 😢💔
I love you and i know these kinda of changes can be alot for our souls but hey 👋 wanna tell you that i love you and u have been consistently present in my life for yeaaaars now and i am so blessed to have you as my role model ❤️
I’m only here for the dogs.
Sending good vibes your way!! Much love 💜💜💜
I was terrified by the title! The moment he set the camera down himself I knew Chris was no longer cameraman. I wish Chris and Maddie the best on their new chapters!! Anyone would be lucky to have you<3
Im gonna miss seeing maddie in the videos and hearing chris in the background and i wish them all the best. ive never clicked so quickly on the video and i wish you all the best jeffree and know that you got this and cant wait to see whats coming :) ❤️
Crazy puppies <3
Oh gosh, what is he to do without a cameraman 🙄 I,  on the other hand dont care 😂😂😂
goodluck chris we love you
Good luck Jeffree!
Jeffree, I hope 2021 is more “forgiving” not more “unforgiving” than 2020! We all deserve that! You are still awesome and anyone who gets to work with you will be blessed! ❤️
Never clicked so fast!  But in all seriousness, we will all miss Chris and Maddy, but I’m happy they’re moving onto the next chapter of their lives and wish them all the best! ❤️
Clicked so fast!  Your hair is everything in this video and all the bears are so precious!  Chris n Maddie will definitely be missed in The Jeffree Star world but I sure wish them both all the luck in the world in their next chapters, I can't be the only one like "bitch! I will definitely come n be your new assistant!"
I FUCKING LOVE YOU BITCH!!!!!!
You’re the best Jeffree! Love you so much!
I had to watch this right away and I almost panicked. Wishing you the best in the future Jeffree 💕💜💙
Really sad to hear about the Star family losing these two bombass energies, that's gotta be pretty lonely to have two friends not be there everyday, when you're so used to them being constants in your life. Praying that you meet some more fabulous people to give the energy poppin in your life Jeffree!     Small Conspiracy theory about this video tho: the hair was for a Japanese/anime themed pink makeup launch coming soon??? at least that's my hope lol
Trying to figure out the background like 👀👀
Maddie was annoying IMO
Feel happy for Chris and Maddie
I love and support you Jeffree!! Can we just appreciate the hair for a minute? So cute!! 💕💕💕
Damn,I think that would make a great reality tv show. Find Jeffree Star a personal assistant !!!!
I love you Jeffree. I wish you a blessed 2021. I know you'll rock it as usual!! 💗💗💗💗💯
I’ll be your personal assistant
Jeffree! I almost started to cry reading the tittle. Then I was like, oh okay Jeffree is here to stay bitches. I love you! Always have Always will!
Love you Jeffree. From the Philippines.
I am sure every body will want to apply for those positions  Just take care and be picky Do some research and be very careful!!!! ❤️❤️
I'm a single Mom with a son off to college...hire me?❤🙏
Awwwwwww
why is it that Jeffree actually responding comments is the only thing i’m shocked about?
Good luck and best wishes to Chris and Maddie.
Ooo I see you with the hair
There's real people out here losing family members to covid. Then there's Jeffree whose having a hard time after his assistant and videographer left. I'm just saying.
I believe in you. You got this. I wish I had support, but I really don't. I love your approach to the video, simple and to the point.
Jeffree I have been along this journey with you for years. Through out everything I’m still here! This is gonna be hard but remember we are all here for you ❤️
Not Maddie 😭!!! U gna be okay tho Jeffree lyn!
Everything will be okay, you will find someone great I know this. LOVE YA LOT'S ! ! 💋🐾🐾✌
Aww Jeffree, that is going to be impossible to find again. I really hope 2021 is better for you and all of us. We love you!
This is just a great beginning of the next cycle.
i thought he was gonna say chris died! i panicked
Time to give Andrew a call!
Please don’t ever stop making videos! We love you ❤️ forever the queen/king of YouTube
Oof 😥 I thought something had happened to Diva 🥺
I’m praying for you Jeffree, Maddie, & Chris
Having two such close people in your life more on must be hard. You'll get through this and I pray you find adequate replacements to help you on your journey. Chin up, queen. We're here for you.
I hope that the new people in your life, Jeffree, bring you nothing but good vibes 😊
Dang those two were really chill and added a lot of flavor to things. Sad to see them go but I hope things are gonna keep going great for them.
I honestly would love to be your personal assistant but I live in texas😭🙄
Hi Jeffree  I'm so  sorry hear this. My heart goes out to you. Sending you positive vibes,prayers and lots of love. Your dogs are so adorable!😀❤❤❤❤
JEFFREE CHOOSE MY SON HE IS 16 and he is a good kid good grades doing online school please give him a life changing opportunity he would love this
I think all of us have felt a shift. This past year gave us more inner reflection. I myself found parts of me again and am going to be picking up on make up again. But really it was finding the parts of myself that I had lost.
I love the dogs
I could be your new pa hehe
We are gonna miss u so much Chris and maddie 😭😭
Love you Jeffree! You will find your groove again soon and I cannot WAIT to have more video to watch :)
Love You Always 💚
You scared me!! I thought you were going to leave us!! 😅❤❤
omg its my birthday please
Changes like that can’t be easy and they were both really important to Jeffrey star cosmetics and to you. Wishing them nothing but the best and I wish you can find someone worthy of your trust and friendship.
i support you in everything you do. God bless you Jeffree i love youu🌌
Good luck to Chris & Maddie in their endeavours from here on in. The J-Star community wishes them a lot of love and happiness🌈🌈.  Oh and the baby bears are cute as ever, Jeffree ❤❣❤🌈
I can feel how emotional and tears Jeff is hold back and how much he will miss Chris xxx
Good Luck Christian!!
OMG I thought you were going to leave youtube. I'm so sorry that they left they will be missed but you are a very strong and beautiful and wonderful person you will get through this
love your hair.
Donatella making a puppy nest 🐶🍼
Petition to have puppies in whole videos more often
Strange day for me too. I just stayed at a bed and bed accomodation and this was the last day for Woodie who had opened her house to visitors after twenty days. She was from England and she talked about missing her family from COVID-19.  So she kept reminding us we were the her last visitors and her villa was going on the market in a day or two for sale. As we were leaving she called me back and gave her a few of her beloved possesions as a memory of her. I just couldn't stop crying and we hugged I kept telling her you will be alright Woodie ...new beginnings may cause anxiety but I know you too will be alright "live your best lives...we are all travelers on this short road of life"...just send universal love. We wished her well in the next stage of her life. Jeffree Starr and his beautiful babies sending blessing your way from Nelson New Zealand on this sunny day.
At least you still have Colin.
Shout out JEFFREE making his whole video for Chris. Love
♥️
I got distracted by your adorable dogs for the entire video and had to start it over.😂
Omg im sorry but i thought you were goin to say tht chris died from covid...
🥺
Why does it keep saying no views
note: this wig is mff sickening
I almost cried seeing the title bc I thought Jeffree was quitting 😅
I can sleep better knowing, you're going to be good. Sending prayers for you're new adventures with new employees.  I think you should do a reality TV show. . And hire your new employees that way. LOL. Super excited for the new products you have coming our way!!!!!
OOOOF scared me that guy, thought you was going somewhere. Good luck on your new journey Christian, I wish you nothing but the best in life.
Love u!
😕😕it’s honestly worse on a personal level when there isn’t a dramatic reason for someone’s exit. Like you’re so happy for them moving up and moving onto bigger and better stuff but you miss them. Sometimes it’s easier to say you hate them for the closure. I’ve been through that myself. So I’m sorry 😞
Ahhhh I love Chris. The chemistry was amazing between you two. Best wishes! ❤
LMK if you are looking for a PA, I am a senior at the University of Kansas with 2 degrees and I am ready to move baby just hmu
Awww I feel for you Jeffreelyn. Must be really hard to lose your two most trusted people in the world. Hope you find great replacements for them. We'd all love to be your assistant tho. Stay safe with the dogs! :)
Whoever you pick next will be amazing as everything Jeffrey does always is 😍😍
New doors are opening and that is a beautiful thing!
I will be your camera and PA move to LA If i need to
Omg Jeffrey you scared me!!! I was thinking something totally different and thank god I was. Sad to see him go he was your partner in crime! He will be missed!! I never clicked on a video so fast to watch! Maddie will be missed to! What's next for you? I want to see another documentary with your life. I know that would be really hard but it would be amazing to live a day in your life! I wanna see the other businesses and see all your other talents!  Xoxo
Everyone is leaving Jeffree because of his toxic energy. I’m happy for them.
Can’t say anything about this. But still loving you guys and can’t wait there’s always new videos coming up for us here 🙌🏼🙌🏼 Jeffree Queen 👑 YOURE THE BEST If I live in California near by you, I wish I could be your best friend and family and work with you too , but of course I know this is impossible to happen on me so ... hope coming up the new one will also the best as chris your team and they’re good person professional by your side to be your new family member 🙌🏼🙌🏼🤗cant relate
Wishing all the luck for Chris and Maddie. And I hope everything will works smoothly for you Jeffrey ❤️
Hugs for you ❤️you got this 🙏🏻
Whoa you got me with that title babe!
In all honesty I'd love to be able to work with Jeffree, he's inspired me to try make-up and tho I still need a lot of work I have improved a bunch! Tho I know I can't work for him cause I live in Michigan and is only 16, but Jeffree I love you so much! ^-^
Can I work for you please ?? 🥺
Omg I was crying before I clicked because I thought it was Diva's last moments. 💔💔  I love his sweet old man face so much.  Way to jump the gun and break my own heart. 🙄
best of luck to everyone involved!
I was gonna SHAKEEE if u were actually leaving *who all thought this was real....*
Kefe
for my case if my boss making this video for me informing everyone i quit the job.. means i do not perform well for 3-6month performance.. and ya, he find replacement better than me.. (general meaning of this huhu)
Thank you for vlogging.
Wow. Click bait. For everyone reading the comments; his assistant quit, and his videographer quit . Lol
House tour update please!!!!
Bitch you got us good!!! Was expecting teaaaaa
Me over here, “Damn should I become an PA?” Then I look at my 2month old baby, and my Bf 😅. Then thinking about how I am a Mess lol
Love the hair !!! Yasss queen! (I make videos ☺️)
Can I Apply to be your assistant?
Aww we will all miss them. Blessing on all their new Journey's in life. New memories to be made.
"what do you think, Chris?" 🥺 we are ALL gonna miss that!   (someone said something similar below, but I accidentally refreshed the comments & cannot, for the life of me, find the comment)
Good luck 💞
Maddy needs her own palette with you.
There are so much shifts in our lives, some have more than others. Life is a blessing, sadly not everyone thinks so.
I clicked SO FAST😂😂😂😂 This is unhealthy
U got this u will rise above again it would be a honor to one day meet u
I love the hair !!!! 💕💕💕💕
💙💙💙💙
everytime I see a video with "we need to talk" or "saying goodbye"   Me: straight to the comments to find out what its about.  The patience I have
You got this ! Hoping who you let into your life will prove trustworthy and loyal,  just like their predecessors x
Love you stay strong you got this 😘
Love you 💗💗💗😍😍
I almost felt when i read the title
I'm so sad hunni I hope your not alone, I would love to come out there and live with you and help you or something, it's just me and my 4 kids lol. Your amazing and a total inspiration to me, keep,your chin up you will find someone you trust. Xxx love you xxx
You’re amazing Jeffree! You will get through this because you’re so incredible! Good luck.
Not the click bait
Saying Goodbye ?!?!I don't like the title
I also recommend that Jeffree should try the sephora collection new skincare line or sephora’s collaboration with COACH. Such a affordable and underrated brand.
I would drop everything to be Jeffree’s assistant. He’s been my whole inspiration and Is the reason why I got into make up in the first place. 🥺🥺
When are the mystery boxes coming out
Whats the black ones name? Daddy? He's my favorite!
Chris and Maddy are one of the people who made the blogs unique and beautiful. It's sad and I can't imagine how it would be for future vids but am happy for the both of them ❤️💕
Clickbait at its finest.  Yawn 🥱
Me watching the puppies the entire time....
iconic chris
Love you Jeffree 🥰🥰
We are going to miss hearing Chris and Maddie behind the scenes also can you review Halsey about face make up line
Let's all wish Chris and Maddie well, I hope Chris has an amazing time back In England, and I know Maddie will do amazing at whatever she decides to do💜
Baby, give all your money away  to charity.
i clicked asap as soon as i saw the title i was like oh hell nah 😱😱😱

So much growth in him, he’s doing great!
I mean, my name is Kaycee Lynne so technically I’m already in the Lynn(e) family. Just say the word and I’m putting in my notice at work. 😌😌😍  *Personal Assistant*
I love you jeffree ❤️
💗💗
🙄 Too bad you didn't say goodbye to that piece of 💩 Jay.
Bitch.. I have no life hire me. Hi Wyoming, how are ya 🙋🏾‍♂️
Literally am only here for the dogs lol
You probably won't see this but I'm an hour south of LA (redlands) and I produce in game entertainment for baseball, and college basketball. Lighting and camera work is what I do!
That Donatella is my favorite!  I love that little princess!  She has an attitude.   Transitions like this can be tough.... but you are already going through it.  Be brave, and just keep swimming!
Best wishes to Chris and Maddie on their next endeavors!!  Jeffree we are so happy just to hear from you! Can’t wait for the mascara.
We love you!!!!!!
LOVE THE HAIR! Good vibes to you always💖😘
Dear Jeffree, you really look like so sad 😢, please be strong, you are so amazing , we love u!
Can we just appreciate the dogs MAULING eachother in the background
Jeffree I’m from the UK and I’m a mortgage broker (think you guys in the states call it a real estate agent). Can I move and be your new PA please ? Deadly serious my Instagram is joshhrowlands ima be looking out for that DM boo
Hang in there, Honey.
Just me or did he say a whole lot of nothing? It sounds like everything he experiences is 'crazy'.
This was a complete waste of my time. And, lose the music.
I won't mind if you only upload your product launch on YouTube. I just hope you're doing all right and not burn yourself trying to get someone new to film your videos. We love you and glad your still safe
Personal question here but how's your mom and family doing Jeffree? I hope their doing good. ❤️
Dramaaaaaaa
I would love to help ya 😍
Thank God! My stomach dropped.
Love you 💕💕
we love jefree stay strong
Love you bish 😘 🖤
Where can I send an application to apply to work for you?
I can be your personal assistant🙋🏽‍♂️
I'd be down to be ur assistant but I'm way to young and live way to far :(
I get it though. Over the years people do the same job but at least they get some time off for vacation and freshens them up. But due to the pandemic, people can't have a break and so people get fed up of the usual thing for a year. People lose themselves. I hope everyone find peace with themselves and get by through this situation.
i’d be jeffree stars assistant !! ❤️
Damn!!!! Good luck 🍀
Clicked soooo fast
You get through this and good vibes to Maddie n Chris.  God bless you Jeffree. Sending you love from San Antonio
🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼💕💕💕💕
No no no no
Being your assistant is my dream job. A girl can dream 😭😭
Poor jeffree his all alone only with doggys to comfort him i sympathize
hang in there Jeffree
MISS THINGGG!! Got so excited to see you post. Check your IG DMs!! Been sending love for 2 + years. ❤️❤️❤️ Love youuuu!! xo  @marrrrr_xo
Remember when Jeffree was the shit ? Since myspace !   It’s sad no one want to take his shit anymore and be around him. Jeeffree i think you an amazing guy sk talented; is just your personality and ego that makes you so dark and evil and unapproachable. I wish you can realize the bad you done make amends make peace and genuinely aim to be a better kinder person, because you can have all the money in the world (at some point) and you can loose everything the next.. appreciate things and people !  I still love ya, hope you’re mentally doing well if not i hope it gets better and you see better blessed days. Good luck 💕
Whatever happens you are going to make it. You've always made it. Scorpio Power biatch! 🙌
I’m so sad for Jeffree- even tho many people thought Maddie left for other reasons; She just wanted to live her own life, same with Christian. But, it’s sad that all the people Jeffree loved and worked with, for YEARS, are just moving on to live their own lives.  Andrew would be a great videographer! I don’t see Shane filming any time soon- so, he’d be perfect to film for Jeffree!! Or, do it yourself; just hire an editor!! Idk: I just hope the next people that work for you, are just as trustworthy and great as those two were! ♥️
I'm ready to move and could use a new job 😅😂😂
I think Donnatella’s colouring has to be my favourite of all the dogs...so pretty!! Good luck to Maddie and Chris!!
Jeffree, you're the *ish. Love you. #StarFamily
Hey do you know brand  name of his camera maybe? Itsss amaaaaiiizing 😍😍😍
💕this is so bizarre 😳I was just wondering what happened to Jeffree ? 🌟and I just got a notification 💕🤍Spooky🤍💕 I hope all goes well for you 🙏💕 The Furbabies are so Sweet and Donatella is getting big already 💜 You will be OK💕🤍💕💄
I wanna be your assistant... 👉👈
I specialize in difficult ppl and willing to travel lol how do I join the JS Team 💁🏼‍♀️ but really how interesting of a job is that being his PA!
Hello sweetheart. 😎👏👏👏🙏💅👂
I have no words.....🥺😭
My dream is to be your PA 🥺
I would move across the country to be your personal assistant 😌😌 wishing Chris the best!!
Jeffree no. I don't even want to watch i'll fucking lose it
Jeffree: *uploads * Me: I am speed
Hey Jeffree, quick question... is Shane alive? We miss him 🥺
Omg😭 best wishes 😭❤️
It’s just a matter of minutes before the drama channels blow up with dramatic assumptions 😩 brace yourself. I imagine both Chris and Maddie signed NDA’s
Since jeffree n nathan split,  jeffree has not been happy. Money doesn't buy happiness....
The show must go on.
I wish you to find your best ever PA ❤️🖤❤️🏆❤️🖤❤️
aw I call my dogs bears too lol
I want to wish Chris the best and, Jeffree, I hope that you find another to do as great a job for you as he did.
I'm down to travel
You got this, babe. Praying for you. Chris, congrats on your new journey in life. Jeffree dont put too much pressure on yourself. Upload when you can. You got this. Rooting for you. One day I'm gonna be able to afford some of your makeup. Love you queen
You are one Badass boss for sure!!!!! You rock Jeffree
I have no life. I available as a PA 🤣
“Whoever it is will fall into my life”,more like  hopefully not fall into another warehouse.
Now I think that the nail lady has left Jefree too.
he's saying that he's going to hire me next
Rich lux wya lol
Good luck Chris and Maddie

And my daughter works at a seriously real ass animal farm , lollipop In Rochester New York !! Perks for the Poms! !!!!  :))
Loving this real down to earth version of Jeffrey!!! This is what I’ve been waiting for.... real genuine raw Jeffrey. It’s perfect! 😊
I'm sorry to hear that, I hope they are doing well on their new paths. This totally explains your sadness & hopefully God will bring good people to fill their shoes, let's face it, those are some BIG shoes💖   Love & prayers 🙏
I am so sorry to see you going through so much 😔 I have loved watching all of your videos. Man do I wish I lived in Cali to be an assistant. LOL Im sure a million people do. I love you for all that you are and all that you do. You make me laugh. I've learned A LOT. And on my bad days watching your videos helped get me through somehow. The first video I watched of you when I discovered you was when you were in Wyoming Michigan at Dollar General.  I live 1 mile from there and SO wish I could have met you!!! LOL. You were in my "Hood" 😂. I hope things get better and cannot wait to see more of you. Wishing you nothing but the best. Get some self care time in and get some much needed R&R  You may never read this but if you do!!! I LOVE YOU!! ♥️
Losing 2 important people in his life is hard. 😥
Donatella is a beautiful color, and she looked soooo soft when you pet her 😍😍
her dogs going at it in the background
We wait dont worry. Kisses and hug god bless you ❣
Hey hun. I was actually wondering  today where you disappeared to and then seen this post. Jeffree youve been such a strong person espcially with everything youve been through the past few years just know that im sure he will always stay your friend even if you guys are growing in different directions. Your gonna be okay. Your lifes gonna be okay. ♡ also im living for your hair its rad as fck.
I would be your assistant quick. I've followed you since Boom Boom Pow 😂
Sad about Christmas and Maddie leaving but so glad it isn't you Jeffree. Best wishes to you all 💜💜💜
Omg I thought something happened to Diva!! I wish Chris and Maddy all the best. Ps. Donatella playing with that blanket 💖💖💖
I love you! My son and I will love to be your assistant! My son is 9 😂 and I’m clearly ... not.
Jeffree... let me love you...
Chris was an important part of this channel. We're all gonna miss him 🥺💜
I wish Chris and Maddy nothing but the best in their future endeavors and can only hope that your new cameraman and assistant will be as loyal as Chris and Maddy were.
Hey but why’d Chris and Maddie decide to leave at once?
<3
You can tell how attached he was to them. He had a bond with them but now that they both have left, it really is difficult to fill the gaps of people in your life. I too had a tumultuous 2020 and it's truly showed me that the most precious thing you can have is a true friendship and great people in your life who care about you. I wish jeffree can move on to find a new energy and try to let more people in.
Couldn't stop sometimes seeing the dogs chilling and doing weird little things while listening and watching Jeffree
We love you bitch,take a deep breath. Go sit down alone and let it out,scream,cry,breathe baby girl. U got this the JSCF has been through so much!It's gonna be okay! I can totally fill that personal assistant gap Maddie has left ❤ Big shoes to fill,to say the least! I'm literally sad rn, I knew she was gone months ago, but still it wasn't confirmed. She has been with us the whole journey of JSC!!!
Love you Jeffree I’m gonna send you my info so I can be your photographer
So long to Chris! Definitely a part of the JS Channel experience! Hope the future it’s brighter and more fabulous for you and JS Cosmetics!
Where is the application form
Aww good luck to Chris. I hope you remain close friends.  Hugs and love to you Jeffree
21 years old, education major I’ll drop everything just to become your personal assistant 😅💖
I thought he was quitting youtube I panicked for a hot second 😅😅😅😅
Jeffree I almost shit myself thinking you were quitting!! 😭
If I was able to be given such an opportunity it'd be life changing so congrats to whomever is chosen to recieve these opportunities ✨
bb you scared the shit outta me with that title!! 2020 was rough indeed, take care of yourself <3 We love you! U r a tough bish!!
“Sadly there’s no tea, no drama”  Sad you have to even say that cause you know ppl just click for the drama. Hoping for a peaceful drama free year for u.
mama this was prime click bait . love u tho jeffree 🤣
Literally thought that you were quitting YouTube. You’ll be missed Christian and Maddie! Good luck to your future endeavours!
I love you, but those two pink hair strands are giving me anxiety! Get them out of your face!
Only ❤️
I have to say one thing congratulations to Chris he will be missed but I wish him nothing but the best in his future. 💓🤗💓🤗💯🌹🌹
Almost feel bad
I’m soo glad that everyone’s gone where their lives have taken them with no falling outs or bad vibes.... your all amazing and wish Maddy and Christian the very best... and I’ve waited to buy a new mascara so I can get yours!!! Can’t wait... sending love and positive vibes your way!!
I’ll be your personal assistant, I can run for Red Bull I’m good at that 😂 I got you Jeffery!!!
I have loved your products for a couple years now and I can’t wait to see what else you come out with
I like this video, it's not dramatic, there's no "shade" or "scandal". it's jeffree. it's more raw than we have seen from him for YEARS. so jeffree, thanks for that.
Oooooo the tea they are about to spill on Jeffree😳😳😳😂😂😂
I’d love to be Jefrree’s PA!
Ooooooo you bout to get dragged for this one
I was always so impressed with the videography that Chris did, especially in your travel vlogs! He really knows how to create a story with the camera. And of course Maddie was iconic hahah 💖 Best of luck to them both!
Should put pants on or like a lady bye sister
This is the most raw and real and sweet I’ve seen you ❤️ so so sweet ❤️🥰
Jeffree is one of the strongest people, she will get through this. Let's pray for him🙏💜
I hope you can find trust worthy people I'm sure it's going to be a a big pain in the ass 😊
I’ll be your new best friend! 😊❤️
Love you Jeffree. Will forever stand by you. 10+ years going strong baby. 💗💫
Noooooo 😭😭😭 Cris and madi !!! At least find a camera man who name Cris 🙏🙏🙏🙏🥺🥺🥺 we need that " how it looks Cris !?? Besides the only vid that Cris didn't do was the only one who cost jeffree problems " the blood money reveal " if i was jeffree i will do anything to keep Cris by my side 🥰🥰🥰 but sure he need to do new things, HAVE A GREAT LIVE CRIS WE ALL LOVE U BRO 😁❤️🙏
I loved this video, so refreshing to see a bit of normality. You're dogs being dogs was the best bit and I love how you call them bears! Why are ppl so horrible about you? You've got so much gratitude for us and everything you've achieved, you're an amazing human being and the right ppl will come along, much love gorgeous xxx
Sending you and your family love Jeffree💓
Love how jeffree is trying to have a serious conversation and the dogs are going insane in the back 😂
Honestly. Bye. Lmao.
Thought he was leaving💀 nearly had a heart attack 😂❤️❤️❤️
Boo hoo 😴 boring
I'm a 33 yr old woman with no friends and three kids I'll be your assistant lol all three of my kids love you so win win lol 😂
❤️💕❤️💕❤️💕❤️💕❤️💕❤️💕
Living for the hair 💗💗💗
So you’re telling me that “Camera man does my makeup” is never going to happen?
You need to say goodbye to hair by jay .
I wish him nothing but the best. I'll miss that gorgeous voice. Pomeranian palace won't be the same without him....I could listen to that man read out of the phone book. Love you Jeffree, hi sweetie 🐻 bears!
When I say I thought this was Jeffree's parting video I was a bit shook
Hi, how are you my friend?
Farewell Maddie and Chris!!
Omg I love you!! You are so awesome!!! If I lived closer I would so love to work for you!! We would have a blast hanging out!!! I live in Sac right now but would do be ready to move to LA!!! Lol!! 😍😁
Nice bit of click bait
I would love to be your personal assistant. That would be so much fun and great experience!
Jeffree all of us want to see your house after editing  and the new black marble closet ,pls
I will be the dogs assistant at this point... I need a job so bad... im at my breaking point...
I still waiting for the makeup foundation, I can even imagine the names they will have like "natural bitch" or Glow as hell" jajaja ok no... 🤭
I wish both of them and you the best of luck❤
I clicked SO FAST because I thought Jeffree was leaving YouTube. Thank GOD he isn't. But, yes, people do move on, and, Jeffree is taking it very well.
6 thousand comments in 27 minutes? Woah 😧
It's sad to not hear Chris and see Maddie. I can feel the loneliness on this video.
Awe I am SO SAD THAT CHRIS AND MAD ARE GONE!!!!!! I lovedddd seeing them both on the channel. Wish I was in LA bc I would be gagged to film your life. Love you starbaby❤️
I'm glad to see you become so successful.
DM me I’ll film for you. What an honor it would be.
Awwww we're all going to miss Chris 😢
we love you soo much!!!!❤️❤️
I would love to be Jeffree’s  personal assistant! 😍I live about an hour and a half away from Calabasas   👀
early owo
I’m willing to be your friend! From Houston TX here 😁
So sad . I just got dumped two weeks ago. The last year has been so crazy and traumatic for everyone. I just want everyone to be safe and find some some happiness and love after all this world has been through 😭😭❤️❤️🙏🏽🙏🏽
Thank you for being so honest about this, you get dragged through so much shit..
Thanks for the heartfelt words. Love you Jeffree!
We will miss Chris and Maddie but we are so happy for them!! A change will do you good 💫
I knew it, I called this a few months ago... many blessings to Chris and Maddie and you as well Jeffree!!  Now, I'm ready for that F**k proof mascara baby!! Let's go!!
All the best of luck to Chris and Maddie 😭 Bittersweet news, but I hope they find new positions that will challenge them. And Jeffree, we know you'll find new people to join your team in your own good time. Good luck! ❤
Yeah getting to trust new people is hard af, hope you can find the help you need soon.
Thought Jeffree was leaving
omg the hair and princess fairy background!! Am living for it. Was hoping for some tea with him and Christian though tbh... did Jeffree try and put the bussy on Chris and ruin everything?
Still no one likes u and no one cares
Life is change . It can be extremely difficult and emotional. No worries.  Take it one minute at a time .
This was beautiful Jeffree. I was the both so much success and happiness. #newbeginnings
That hair looks horrendous.    Jeffree is getting dated, and looks tired.
& you are still standing looking fabulous!!! Copied  by many & duplicated by none!! I wish him all the best in his new Journey in life....
I’ve no seen u in forever. I clicked so fast lol  Sorry Chris is leaving. You’ll find another good one! Changes happen for a REASON, stay strong.
i dont like how he says it's such a bad thing that he doesn't travel anywhere or doesn't do things that other people have never even been able to do something close to that. he's so problemat
Jeffrey Star, if you see this virtual hugs 🤗 from me to you!  If that's okay?  I love you ❣️😘 virtual kiss on the cheek  too because of the covid-19 situation.
*I genuinely LOVE you filming on your own!!!! I actually felt like you were talking directly to me, which is what Youtube allows us to have. I know your life gets hectic, but I wish you would stick to it! Just you, the makeup, the dogs, and the 16m of us.*
Dont hire Christian from Nicolette gray and those ugly D'miglio or whatever girls pls   hes DRAMAAAA 🤢🤮
We’re can we apply :p
Ok bye
I love you Jeffree so much❤️❤️
Love you Jeffree! 💖
Love those hair bows sister
Clicked so fast!!
Okay, so what you’re saying is you need a new PA 🤔🤔😇😇
Imagine is a movie came out about Jeffrey’s life!?!!! I would watch in a heartbeat.
Sending positive vibes ❤️
It's just that time for self growth and positive changes. Keep your head up things will work out great!
Yassss Jeffree I can’t wait for your  review on the new elf chipotle collection. Stay iconic queen
Jeffree Star we need a foundation !!
Omg! Jeffree! Do like a game show! For your next assistant! You’ve been one of the main reasons I’ve remained somewhat sane for the past year. And I know you probably never hear it, but thank you, you mean a lot ❤️
I can't stop screaming at how cute that fuckin dog is the lil one messing with the the bigger one by your left ass cheek. Amazing. I can replace chris! Just give me a bedroom n that's it.
Look at the Baby!!😍
don't get the vaccine jeffery! OMG.
I love you
She got so real on this video! I got emotional! For real! Ive never seen her so vulnerable before like in this video. Loved the video! It gave me the chills ❤️
I can’t stop looking at the puppers
K but, who's the new man??
My fur baby boy passed away 💔🐕😔
When everyone around leaves maybe it's time to realize what the common denominator is. I truly hope you take 2021 to step back work on yourself learn to truly love yourself let yourself heal forgive yourself
Your hair looks ridiculous, and I'm sure you a pain in the a** to work for!!!
Everyone is leaving you. Maybe chill for a minute and think about why that is.
Sending you love and positive energy, Jeffree 🖤
🙏😇
I can only imagine how difficult this all is emotionally. When changes like this occur, all one can do is be thankful for the great years past and hopeful for the futures of all concerned. I wish all of you the best.
You should say goodbye to your disgusting hair "artist".
One thing hasnt changed....your wig stylist
How do you get ahold of these people to ask a question?
Glad everyone is okay, I've noticed Maddie's absence for some time.  Here's to "the next best thing!"
"it's been wild. Really really wild"... also the name of dixies next song
Your right we have to move on. Good luck to them both but I will miss them.
Even the rats are jumping ship.    Down, down, down...
Who else was so distracted by the cuteness of the babies 😩😍
Holy crap. I thought this was great quality and then  I checked what quality I had it at and it was only at auto
Ask Andrew. You already know him.
yeah it’s been hard for everyone
You got this! if not.. call you girl, i am only a city away from you! If your in Hidden Hills. @jeffreystar
Thought he was gonna pull a Becca lmao
I’m over here thinking jeffree is quitting YouTube but we’re just losing two amazing people that was behind the scenes 🥺
We'll miss you, too, Chris!!!
I wish you had your own t.v. show I would tune in every week to watch ♥️
I hear you, it’s major changes in your life, but change can be good, something new will happen to inspire you. Stay strong. ❤️
i  have    fallowed you sins 2012🥰🥰🥰🥰
✨exception to my last statement✨
I love how all the fur babies have smiles on their faces as you speak 💕
How sad to have so many close people go. Gracefully handling ♡
💙🇲🇽💙
Clickbate the haus. They are a clever clever person. I'm here for it x
🎀⚜️good morning⚜️🎀
I’ll do it! It would literally be an honour to work for a company like yours, and for somebody as talented and driven as yourself.  Bye Chris! Good luck with everything your future holds!
We never got a "camera man does my makeup" video :(
Best of luck to you. I hope you can find good honest kind ppl to help you out. Much love 💕 from Tampa, Fl. You will find some ppl to help with your future endeavors
The way Jeffree was building it up I thought Chris had passed away or something.
Love ❤️ uu Jeffree!!  I would be an amazing PA for you and I would move to Cali ASAP for u!!!  Good luck 🍀👌🏻🙏🏻
So much growth! May your next chapter continue to fulfill your soul! You're so smart and inventive, we love watching what you do! 💜
my life is worthless take me instead
Thank you Chris and Maddie 💕
You had me worried girl! ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Congrats for both dears. Hugs and loves from Hong Kong.
Damm I would love to be your PA what a dream job I wish u all the best
Omg Donatella is so beautiful I love her
I only see a lonely person, without friends, sad things going (except for his merchandise) the only thing he has is the doggies, and his mansion. I only see a person that lives for the material and money. A lot changes, a lot people have been out of his life (beauty gurus even the nicest one), a lot of drama. Drinking (not alcohol, his pain) and hiding his sadness. Nothing more than loneliness. Hope 2021 at least give him good chances ❤️  Btw, this is like the Telenovela “Teresa” in the finally 😂
...I just hope Jeffery is not alone. In the house. Like he a bad ass and do not need anyone..butt.. I just don't want him to be alone.
We love you !!
Wonder if he actually see this and replies back to my comment saying . I'm good how are ya ???
Good lord I almost burned dinner freaking out about that "saying goodbye" tag, trying to hurry up and watch not paying attention to a damn thing lol
I'm crying so much this is so sad😢
I love Domi Lynn!!! I would be her personal assistant. She is the naughtiest dog and my personal goddess lol
sad this was his family and they are growing up :( 🙏🏽👑
Jeffree: "there is alot of thing going on, and I wanna have a deep talk"  Dogs: "WELCOME TO WWE SMACKDOWN!!!"
Good luck 🤞
Love you Baby Cakes <3
I am sorry that they are not here anymore, but glad that everyone finds they're own road. I'm nit from California...but I would live to help you even to get you water when needed, or redbull sugar free; i love that one too
Sad to see them go 😔, its never easy losing amazing team members, especially when they become your fam ❤   ...but where do I apply?! 🔥
I'm there!!!!!
I have to agree totally, 2020 was a heavy year for a lot of people, times change and so do people, I hope you get it all sorted out because yes, trust is hard to come by these days, we all need to slowly get back on track and shift with the times, god speed to your friends Chris and Maddy, all the best to them and sending you beautiful blessings and to all who may need it, stay frosty out there all!
I feel so sad.. can’t imagine what do you feel. The amount of sadness is crazy. 4sure.
Jeffree can’t trust nobody so hiring a cameraman that faithful and an assistant that consistent won’t be an easy thing to do not with the whole money in the world especially with what had happened to jeffree
goodbye
❤❤❤❤❤❤🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈
Got my hopes up
Dude thought u were leaving the industry or something not saying goodbye to a friend
I THOUGHT HE WAS LEAVING DAMN
😔😔✋🏻🙏🏻
No one reviews make up like Jeffree, he's the best at it
Guess i can sit my English butt back down. was legit looking for applications. i love you Jeffree
Your dogs are sooooo cuteeeeee!
I can be your PA. 😂😂
I thought your dog died. Thats the only reason I came here. 🙄
Good luck!! 💕
Never closed the Bible so fast
I don’t think I have ever clicked so fast

Well done
The way I jumped to the comments
we love you and  the haters  are just  jells    we thank  you  haters  1 comes shcool 2 comes boy 3  shout out to the haters because there my motivators😁😁😁😁
I’ve never been that close to seeing Ms Jeffree cry. But it’s nice to see the real side of him.
I’ll work for you!
its kinda funny watching it x2 , save u some time and it's laughable tbh 💀💀
The hair, I’m living.
😍🙏🏻🤞🏻❤️
No matter what happens u made awesome memories with them....they will always be there for u and love u for u. Stay strong baby girl...❤️❤️❤️❤️
I would quit too. All that drama with kanye. I wouldnt wanna ruin my career  Cuz of what jeffree did and able to get a job. Lmao
Jeffree we miss you here on YT 😭 please come back!! We'll miss Chris so much 😭
You are such a strong person and I hope find person for the jobs that click together with you like puzzle piece and trustworthy..I enjoy your videos so much
Dear Jeffree,  If you need a friend I’m here.. 😀🥰 Continue to slay like you always do 😁😁
Hello Jeffree you did a great job...
I have never in my life clicked soo fast
It has to be hard. You will find the right people... You still have a lot of supporters that love you!!
I always wanted my comment to be liked
Baby don’t stresss! I can be a bomb manager 😂❤️❤️
Really nice how he's giving them credit and celebrating their time with him, we love positive unproblematic Jefree :) Good luck
Me: Literally have no one and do nothing...
Love u
The cutest dogs ever! I wonder what their breed is. I'm in a small apartment so they're perfect. I love animals so much. Usually more than people. Lol. I just want to cuddle up with pup.  :)
Yea i wandering where's meidi.. and here's the answer. I miss when u always call "chris" now he's gone. It's really hard when someone really close n understand who u r is missing n the magic thing its like telepath, these person knows exactly what's inside your head..well goodbye meidi & chris love u both and god bless u always. And jeffree be strong and i know will be more good friend n team or even soulmate coming to u 🙏😀❤️
Bless you Jeffree. You will be fine. Hope you find some good people to work with.
Don't come here just to be bitter and leave a mean comment. Let people enjoy this new video, let people enjoy an update from Jeffree. There are people who have been watching this channel since the beginning and are sad to learn that Chris and Maddie are leaving.
Maybe Chris and Maddie are getting married
Bro I thought you were quitting. I got scared
No. You cannot say good bye you’re a ✨STAR✨
Here's when he invites Andrew 😂
Wishing both Chris and Maddie the best of luck in the next chapters of their lives!! I know they were such amazing employees of yours but also such great friends as well.
i think this is the most vulnerable video i have ever seen from jeffree and i love it
i thought he was gonna say that chris died-
Chris the camera person is leaving  Edit: Maddie has also moved on
Idk if I want to be Jeffree or one of his dogs
I’m gonna miss hearing “what do you think Chris?” in the middle of recording videos 😔😢
I’m really horrible with change, and saying goodbye, so I definitely feel for you. Chris has been in your life for SO long! He’s family, and so is Maddie! It’s  also extremely hard to find someone you can trust, so you’re in a scary situation. I just wish you all the best. I know things will get better. 💖
Wishing you, Maddie, and Chris all the best Jeffree! We know you’ll figure it out! We love you!! 💖
♥️💔 I can be your assistance lol. This year has been very tough. I'm in Texas and my house got broken pipes water damage mold the whole 9! Very rough year for me already.
Was about to say :( don’t leave yt
Eek I haven’t watched it yet but I’m scared....
Soooo where do i apply??
I love you jeffree!! I hope you get new people to trust
Sooo understandable ❤️👋🇨🇦
Miss you and love you jeffree
I kinda feel for Jeffree..tbh I was a fan and I have changed my mind along the way cause he has done some mistakes but it's really difficult to let go of so many people..sending some positivity stay strong ❤️
Wishing you the best! - much love from Denmark 🌸💕
Maybe Andrew could help you
3:53 dessert smiling into the camera
Me: Reads title Also me: duces bitch-
✨🎀🎀🎀🎀✨
Biiiiiiiiiitch ya can't trick us like that 😭
Whatever you do...I'll be there with bells on.  I really appreciate a creator who really does try to do what they say they're going to do,  puts forth the effort..may stumble and fall...but continues to consistently do better.  This woman of color appreciates that and thinks others could learn a thing or two from you. If we want people to do better we have to give them space to do it in. Change is hard AF...to do it with a million eyes and a million opinions raining down on you on a daily...BIIIIITCH!! That's some next level shit. That's why I stan and give no fucks what anyone else has to say. I see you Queen. I appreciate you 🥰
Loved just hearing you talk so openly here and all I can say is I wish you the best. And honestly I wanted too say thank you...today I went to my apartment complex office too see if the cavity palette 🦷 I ordered was just being stored and ready for pickup, I was so delighted too see it was and that it truly was delivered. In doing that before 5:00pm I also was planning on going too the local mall here too pay a bill and found out a shooting had taken place right before I had contemplated doing the longer errand before going too see about my package. I can say that I was grateful for my patience and that your package helped me stay out of danger. I adore it btw  🥰  your passions are too create and I cannot wait too see what you make next! Much hugs 🤗 I’m sure you will find more wonderful people too help achieve your vision!
must be really sad to say goodbye to people that's been working with you for years :(
I wish Chris the best!  I hope you find someone that works for you!  So love seeing the pups!  They always make me feel better!
Don't scary us like that. I just had a baby girl today. I thought you were giving up youtube or something like that.
"Chris is irreplaceable 😭"  *replaces Chris*
I WAS SO SCARED !!!!
Funny how so many people are moving on
I think if someone makes a drama video out of this, that's really low on their part. Here is a person sitting alone in front of a camera, talking lowly and quietly, and telling us what's going on. There is no "inside scoop". He's telling Chris and Maddie, "Go. Live your dream."
I love the pups
I told my son...he's in San Diego and that's what he went to college for....I told him hit your Instagram :) Good luck no matter who you choose
You go gurl
I love how so many thought he was quitting. The fuck? Chill bitch this queen isn't slowing down!!
Love that wig
I can literally see such a humble heart within Jeffree! And I just love this side of you. Not that I don't love the in yo face moment,but this softer side is beautiful.
Thank God you aren't leaving YouTube 🙏 I love you Jeffrey stay strong like you've always been remember to take care of yourself and the negativity ❤💙💛
Hello jefree saludos desde santiago de chile.......
All of your issues literally relate directly back to you just being an asshole LMAFOOOO 😭
Awww sorry Jeffreestar but good luck to them and you.
How amazing that you had such wonderful friends on your team! You were all so lucky to take that journey together, I'm glad you all got to have that time together before moving onto this next chapter of life!  I wish you all my very best in the days to come! <3
You look sad, u look lonely and upset...ur not the same as u use to be....its ashame ur not the same person... hope ur OK mentally 😔
You look so beautiful Jeffree. ❤️ love you.
I have noone to turn on the camera for me.. "UGH my life is so hard"  Hahahahahahahaha Loveya bitch <3
Please be kind to Jeffree, he has been through a lot already 💜💜💜
Big hugs to you. Definitely big changes. Good luck to you and your team. Xo.
it was the random close-ups for me...
As long as you don’t leave YouTube!!
Damn I was hoping this was you saying good bye to YouTube!
Here for the PA position haha✨
Is it just me who’s loving the vlog format? She’s cute.
Love youuuuuuu so much Jeffree❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Love you Jeffrey!!
Aww it’s rly hard when loyal employees leave I hope you feel better soon!
4 months from now   “dogs decided to leave and move on to a new chapter of their life”
I freaked thinking that J was leaving YouTube. Mini heart attack!
Whose Chris
Love youuu
he isn't leaving YT , save your time
love the cute little music in the last few seconds
Hello my love how are you you look very nice 😘
My heart stopped when I saw the title🥺
We’ll miss you Maddie and Chris!
I thought u was quitting youtube lol
Hey jeffree star I’m a big fan
girl...this seems so genuine
Omgggg I almost had a stroke 😅 So good to see you check in and keep it 💯 I soooo wish I could fill either position, legit, amazing opportunities to be able to work with you and travel!! Trust in the universe, life is full of surprises, people come & go, things change, we learn & grow everyday, and everyday is a fresh start ♥ sending you all the love, light & positivity ☮🕉☯️
Omg i thought you were leaving youtube- thank god - dont ever leave us❤️❤️❤️ Also- I can be your PA/HR advisor ;) 😘
Omg I go workout and he drops it! Squeeee
I don’t know if it’s just me? But seeing Jeffree like this and on his own he seems more himself? I sensed a more grounded Jeffree and a changed Jeffree. ✨
People are never too old or too smart or too successful to take an unchartered path. And, it should be respected.
I'm truly sorry J, I hope 2021 will be a better year for you all, sending good vibes and hugs 💕
Take your time and breathe. We love you Jefree and always have your back
Not me thinking you were leaving YouTube 😰😭
I hope that you are able to adjust to these changes & enjoy the next chapter in your own life/career as well. New people can bring new & refreshing energy, just be mindful of who you allow into your circle. I also wish Madison & Christian all the best in their future endeavors. Love always <3
I'm just waiting for the vault closet tour!
If you need a new PA I’d love to be yours!👀🙏
I actually enjoyed this, he didn't yell or scream laugh. 😉
Don’t let the door hit ya where the good lord split ya ~Miley Stewart
I would love to be your assistant so bad!!! I love everything about you.... #calilife be blessed n safe... you could see how much u actually cared about ur close employees
Love you Jeffree!!!
I’ll miss   Jeffree:-     “what do you think chris?”    😩🥺
You did great. Change is hard, but soo good. Fresh starts can be exciting!!!
Please hire me Jeffree!!💚💚💚
I love you
Look that the baby’s playing in the back 😩😩
I thought the worse.. 😭
I wish I lived in Cali - I would rock that P.A. job.😉
Damn I really thought you were leaving the internet once and for all
omggggg
Omg I can't focus because of those precious puppies. 🤣❤️ They are hilarious. Glad you're ok tho. ❤️🏳️‍🌈
My heart skipped so many beats it’s ridiculous.
You got this Jeffree, you are a strong bitch. Love you so much
OMG my heart lol you mentioned chris just after saying there have been lots of deaths, i thought you was going to say he'd died!!!
Glad to see people growing and spreading their wings. Excited to see your new products! I could be your assistant but I'd have to bring my two babies with me lmao but you'll find someone perfect! Thanks for updating us
It's been 5 and a half years! It would be weird if he wasn't moving to the next thing to grow in his life & career. It's sad but exciting to see friends go on their way.
Change is always hard.  Good luck Jeffree. We love you 💕
What happened to your other puppy? I remember you getting 2 at once but you abruptly stopped posting about the other one. And it’s not in any of your snap videos.
Change is always difficult this was one of my favorite videos, just cause it was so personal. Take your time finding someone you vibe with, in the meantime one on one videos great. Can't wait for the  Chipotle make up review video!! We love you!
About a year ago, we lost Jenna Marbles. Now, we're losing Jeffree (not permanently (for now)). Hope to see you soon Jeffree
It makes me so angry how people have to make everything about gossip and drama. I wish we all cared less about tea and more about our fellow human beings. I love the way you said this and hate that you had to say it. (Also you scared me with that title Miss Mama!!) Love you lots 💖
You scared meeeeee
Take me with you jeff.... I can clean floors.
I was so scared when I saw the title bcs you're such an INSPIRATION to me and I don't ever want you to leave. Also I'm so glad you sat down and just opened up and talked to us. It felt like old times bcs after all the hate you kinda distanced yourself from us,the fans that really love you and support, you and didn't open up for awhile. But now JEFFREE star is back! Don't ever let haters get you and keep on being you,the iCONIC LEGEND that you are! 🌟💜
Omg jeffree!!! I almost had a heart attack.. i got high blood pressure.. oye, that title almost killed me 😿
I would work for you for free if you’d take me to your amazing lip filler person.  😘
Thank you for being so real in this! it is the first time in awhile...
Awww jeffreeee I’ll always support youuu
Y’all my heart dropped when I read the title
You’ve had a lot of bad shit happen to you. I’m so sorry that you have, yet you continue to fight and even make a dedication to stay trouble free. It’s admiring :)
🤗💪💜
Don't worry I'll be around in 2021 22 23 24 25 26 and on and on and on. Our friends don't miss you btw 🖕
We Stan NDA's! 🤩
I clicked this video so fast
That's a huge transition with those two key people moving on. Jeffree has such a busy life, they probably want to slow down with family, or maybe start a family etc :)
IVE NEVER BEEN SO EARLY IN MY ENTIRE LIFE
You got this Jeffree!!!!!! Sending you lots of love❤️
POV: you thought that Jeffree was quitting YouTube because the title was “saying goodbye” but it was really just saying by to Chris and Maddie :(  Edit: thanks for all the likes :)
GIRL I HAVE NEVER CLICKED SO FAST MY ASS REALLY THOUGH U WERE LEAVING 😭😭😭😭
Jeffree star: saying goodbye  Me: bitch you better not
You are a very strong person! My kids are all grown I wish I could live in California! You seem like a cool person but Jersey is far far away ! Lol! Good luck I hope u fine the right person to fill those tall shoes!
Byeeeee ya big fuckin mess 😙👋
I dead ass would drop my whole life and move to california to be jeffrees assistant. Jeffree, DM me, I will straight up quit my job and start working for you. Im detail oriented, I keep a strict schedule, I would love to work for you.
Never clicked on a video so fast!! You look good jeffree.  Just breath you got this!!
Kinda clickbait 🤷🏽‍♀️ but I’m glad to see you are doing well, Jeffree! Life has a way of changing us and everything around us, even if we have no idea it’s doing so. Best of luck with your search!!! ❤️
I’m just glad you aren’t leaving!!!! It’s a new year though so a fresh start with some things is a good way of moving forward 💪🤘💗
From the bottom of my heart, I really wish we were friends. 🙌💖
Aww I'm gone to miss you ive been watching you ever since you started YouTube💕you been a bug inspiration to me
I love your hair
I never panicked so much.
How come Chris and Maddie didn’t join the video with you? Maddie lives in your house, this makes no sense.....
Lets be honest. The Wyoming move is to escape Cali taxes.
I clicked this so fast I thought he was quitting 😂🖐️
can we get a jeffree exhale count going
Yesss u look soo amazing Jeffrey 😍😍😍I mean your Jeffrey  tho dont expect nothing less
Jeffrey: “I had to go pee and get a drink, sorry if that’s too personal”  Me: “BiTcH! We family.. nothin too personal”
goodbye I'm going to miss you
JEFFREE WE LOVE YOU! 💓
You are the baddest boss bitch, Queen. You take the time you need so that when you stunt on these haters they will be left speechless! 💯
Love you jeffreestar, you are really an inspiration for me! ❤❤❤❤❤❤
**Video posted 17 minutes ago** How is there a video that was posted 21 minutes ago?-
I needed this ❤️
Maddie was a queen! I hope all of them the best.
God Bless you and praying that the perfect people are put in your life
here we go 🙄
Why they do him like that on the thumbnail😭😭😂
Okay Jeffree can you hire me please?
Do we have opinons on him getting the vaccine?? He's not 65+ and he's not medically fragile, as far as I know. So...........
Stop, this title had my heart bussin in my chest
I can't wait to see what you do next!!!
❤🧡💛💚💙💜🤎🖤🤍
When i tell you i panicked!!!!! Jeffree dont do that too me again boo. i was so sad. Stopped in the middle of work to watch.
I just got home and you just posted. I’m happy to see you back and good to hear positive changes and you look good. 😘💋
I'm feeling your stress and I just wish I could give you a huge hug cause I could sure use one. For the last week ive woke up everyday and wondered if were going to make it..just 3 days ago I was staring at my doggies feeling like a terrible pet mom because they were out of food and I scraped together $10. I know everyone has there own stress going on I just hope more than anything we all get through this before more people give up. I love you all so much and I'm thinking of you all and Jeffery 🌟 your in my ❤.
✨✨✨✨
Lmao nice click bait for everyone he’s saying goodbye to Chris and his assistant not YouTube unfortunately 🙂
My heart goes out to my friend... 💜💜 love you much Jeffree.
I will take care of your dogs! I love dogs more than people lmao. I've grown to love you after watching almost all of ur videos, including some of when you sang.
I love poms and sugar ♥️ do I qualify
Love you :3
how on earth could he replace those 2..it would takes years to find someone even half as good. Best of luck Jeffree <3
Jeffree, I know you'll find some amazing people to fill those positions in your life. I'm praying that all the drama surrounding you and your friends disappears soon, so that you can continue to do what you do best...everything!
Little pup is adorable!
So how do we apply for the personal assistant position ? 😁
This is the best clickbait of 2021
I’m trying to be Jeffrees new assistant so I can be around his dogs lol
Love you Jeffree!!!
So lovely ♥️
It's definitely been a bizarre year all around!    Wish you all the best Jeffree, you've got this! ❤
Jeffrey  Saying goodbye   Me 👀
We’ll miss Christian! Wishing him all the best for whatever awaits him.
BLESSINGS MASSIVELY ALWAYS !!!! LIFE SHIFTS 180>360 NO WORRIES BELIEVE IN YOURSELF >>>> U GOT THIS💖
So.... shane dawson ?:) he needs a job
Pick me for a personal assistant!! 😜🙂❤️
Also, my best buddy lives in Casper, Wyoming and actually saw you in person not too long ago. I told him that if he sees you again, that he needs to buy you a Red Bull and tell you that it's from his friend in Philly.
Needed the deep breath.
I wanna go to sleep someone tell me what he talks about so I don’t have 2 watch plz
Jeffrey you are my inspiration of life. God bless you!
You can really tell how much they both mean to you, obviously they're so much more than just employees. It speaks volumes that you made a whole video to say how awesome they are and that you'll miss them ❤
Hope all goes well for you❤️
There is way to much pressure on youtubers, you do you!! You have lives that aren't in the media. You post what ever content you see fit. Everything is consistently shifting and changing and everyone has their own way of doing things. Hate that youtubers have to explain themselves and viewers feel the right to question someones job.  viewers would hate their managers questioning them so why do it to a youtuber?
So so sorry things will work out.  all the more they can grow and discover their own worlds now. You’ll make it JS! You got this! ✨💕
baby you got this ♡ ❤ you are a tough and strong bitch. and I know u are going going get through whatever comes your way! I will never stop supporting you I don't care about anything else. you have inspired.me to.do so much and you have gotten me through some dark.times. so know baby you have good people still that love you and only want the best for you ❤♥
Did he have to have the dogs behind him, so annoying
How could I apply to be your personal assistant? I’d LOVE TO apply
I think Jeffree should move on from YouTube. Chris is gone so the quality may not be there in the future and since the ridiculous set-up by James Charl........., I mean, "scandal" last year with Shane I get the feeling he's just not into it and he's going through the motions. His brand is established, obviously letting people into his life only opens the door to the parasites that call themselves the drama channels to speculate what is going on with him. There aren't many make up brand owners who front their own YouTube channels and allow people so much access, he needs to walk away, keep it cute and up the mystery around him some more, people will be begging for the scoop instead of looking for cracks to tear him down.
Jeffre never say goodbye to me 💕💕💕
Hewo
I wish he’d update on him and Shane
hmmm don't know if i believe that there's no tea
Can I volunteer ? I’m broke af
loving the hair 😍
I’ve never clicked on a video as fast as I clicked on this one!
❤️
Still my number 1 Jeffree we always move on💕
I for real got a heart attack
i forgot about u
What about Andrew? The one who used to film for Shane?
THIS TITLE MADE MY STOMACH DROP TO MY FEET Jeffree you scared the hell out of me. Good lord. Thanks for the heart attack. Love you!!!! 🖤🖤🖤 you better not ever leave us. You are the cure for my depression, my inspiration and motivation. Thank you for showing us you can come from nothing 🖤💕💯👑
Let me be your assistant. I don’t have any experience but I will learn for you . Xoxo
Got scared you were gonna quit for a second, I’m like not you too
I hope Chris and Maddie succeed on their future endeavors!
Going to miss Chris, I hope his new life chapter is amazing. 💙
Your dogs are gorgeous omg I want one
Nooo don't leave meeeeeee
I would love to film your life, or just your amazing looks! It must be overwhelming on your own. I'm sorry, it's sad when people move on to open new chapters only because you'll miss them dearly.
Best of luck Chris & Maddie ❤️
Missed you ❤️❤️❤️
So I'm an empath and tarot reader... I won't put your personal business on here but Jeffree.... I am so very proud of you and the inner work you've been doing with yourself privately.  No one is owed an explanation for anything in your life moving forward, you are in total control... continue to take this time for yourself so you can take over the beauty world and knock em' dead like you always have!  I wanted to cry just watching you and not just for the subject of this video....  You'll always be a beautiful work in progress and that's not anything you have to prove to anyone, my love... I'm very proud of you.  I hope that resonates.  Sending you much love and blessings... Stay light and continue to allow love in... XOXO
I can see the sadness in his eyes. My heart hurts for you, Jeffree. I will always stan, as you're always your most authentic self. Be strong, be diligent, ans you'll find your new normal, like we all have ❤
So many people made so many changes in their lives because of 2020.  It was an eye opener of a year and forced things in to perspective.   You'll find your groove.
Those dogs are _adorable,_ Jeffree.
Gonna miss his comments behind the camera😢 hopefully the next cameraman is just as amazing if not more and is a good person
Why they go... for sure they have good salary... and its pandemic 🤔 maybe they saved a lot if money already
Who thought that she will retire
Best of luck to Christian and Maddie. I’m sure you’re excited for what the future holds for them, but it can’t be easy. They’ve both been a huge part of your life for years. Trust your gut when picking replacements. Keeping you in my thoughts and prayers. I adore you, Jeffree. Xoxo
jeffree always does this when hes low on views, and yall always fall for it. lmao
k, bye xo
Omg saw this and had to click ASAP!!!!! 🧐 🤔
.... whaaaattt
i have never clicked faster on a jeffery star vid in my life
Not gonna lie. I had a heart attack and thought you were saying goodbye to YouTube. T w T Good luck Christian and Maddie!
If I didn't have a fam and wasn't settled in this point in my life, I would totally hop on that train to be a personal assistant. Want a Red Bull? Already have it in hand.
gurl bye
it annoys me how people are wanting tea/drama its like people live your own lives, and losing two close employees whom you trust in his industry would be a huge loss personally and professionally... I think you all should know hes not about the tea these days..💙🤎🤍❤🐶🐶🐾🐾
Bitch wtf I was SCARED I thought Jeffree was quitting YT the fuck
Jeffree I thought you were leaving youtube or something! Thanks for my first mini heart attack
I'm ready to be your assistant.  My family said Bye already 😁💜💜💜💜
I wish you all the luck jeffre 🙏🏼🙏🏼
HOLY SHIT JEFFREE you scared me!!! 🥺🥺🥺 I thought you were quoting YouTube you literally make my day omg I crapped a brick 😫
Jeffree I love you 🤟🏽 cannot wait to see what you do next!!
I would do anything to he his personal assistant
This made me realise how much I appreciate jeffree like I was scared he was leaving social media
Man, wish I was good at editing and being a personal assistant. You look like such a great person and always care. Yea here and there but who doesn’t have any? Haha. I hope you find the  right person for those jobs and get your footing back. All the best man :)
Really wish you would’ve touched on more, including HBJ.
Gonna miss Christian and that beautiful British accent! Maddie is also missed. I work in Student Affairs but would love a change of scenery and change of career. Holler :)
Hi. I would like to apply to be the next personal film assistant 😭🤍
Congrats to Chris and Maddie!! I know you're sad, but when they go onto much bigger things, at least you can say you helped them! I hope you find 2 amazing, trustworthy people to take their places!
Yall thought he was done with YouTube when he makes money off it.. LOL that would be an idiotic move
Aw I missed you 🤍
I’m gonna miss the “what do you think, Chris?” Wishing him and you, Jeffree, all the best 💖
When the dogs playing in the background are more interesting than the actual video
I love you JS ♥️♥️♥️always ♥️💐
Good Luck beautiful xo
Awww jeffree 💖 hugs to you!!
More entertained watching his dogs rather then the actual video lmao
Nothing but positive vibes for all!
Seriously, I’ve just missed you, Jeffree. Just the realness of this video helps bridge that gap.  Don’t be a stranger ❤️
you need to review the new Nyx Lip Shine Loud liquid lipsticks!!!!
My motto... “You can’t control what life throws at you, but you can control your reaction to it.”  Looks like you’re living this.
Good vibes being sent always.
awesome clickbait congrats
WASTE OF SHIT TIME VIDEO
It’s nice to have a video off jeffree let’s hope he comes back to YouTube full time & not stop all together now Chris has left I hope you find a new camera man/woman soon & a new assistant because we miss you & your videos 😘😘

Change is good. Deep cleansing breath in and deep cleansing breath out. Good vibes only. You got this. Embrace Spring as the season of renewal, rebirth... think positive thoughts and love on them puppies, they always make you happy. Surround yourself with family and bask in the sunshine.
I wish you well and hope you get someone to film for you 🥰🥰🥰
Best of luck finding a new assistant and camera man Sending positive vibes your way don't let the haters bring you down...💜💙💚💛💛🧡❤️
Thanks for sharing some personal business with us.  I’m sure Maddie and Chris are getting god’s references from you. What feather in their cap having worked for the fabulous Jeffree Star!
Even though now watching Jeffree's videos doesn't really feel the same after all the drama that happened it still hits in the heart thinking that Jeffree might leave YouTube :((
I  just love you!! You’re growth and openness is inspiring 🖤
I'll be your assistant.
I hope all is well with everyone around Jeffree and his employees and ex employees. And I had to say this, that wig is absolutely amazing. 💜💜💜💜💜💜
Love you !!! Glorious scorpio, scorpios tend to have a hard start but you are a legend. Hope your mind is well! Thank you for sharing your amazing loud personality, inspires me. I'm a capricorn btw ❤️
WHY IS HE NOT ZOOMING IN ON THE DIGGING IM MELTING THE DOGS ARE SO ADORABLE
I’m ready to fall into your life J! 💜🍬
Jeffre I’m going homeless with my 11 month old daughter:(
Going to miss your videos
No!! Not Christian and Maddy!!!
ill be your new personal assistant 🥺
Jeffrey, I hope you find some trustworthy and loyal new people. Of course they won’t replace them (& they shouldn’t either) but one day you’ll find someone.   -PS: always wondered what it’s be like to work for you for one day.
<3 LOVE U SINCE 2009, LOVE U FOREVER <3
😳 What The Actual F! 😳  😲 What Have I Just Watched?!?! 😲
Those puppies look so happy :) I'm glad Jeffree is staying and can't wait for more tutorials...or whatever really. I haven't seen a video I didn't like
Aww Jeffree it’s gonna be okay🥰
Hire me as your assistant!
Yes
For me, 2020 was the year in which I genuinely had to face down my own ingratitude. It was difficult, and I didn't always do it right, but I learned how to be grateful for what I have, for my day job, for my talents, and those who love me. I've finally come to terms with who I am - an artist with a day job, a regular guy - and I'm proud of it.
Should get Andrew hes loyal and funny
Hey friend . Good vibes coming your way. ❤️✌🏾forever.
Almost die... love you JS & Chris❤
I wanted you to know that I have enjoyed your videos ever since I have discovered them from learning how to do make up the proper way and just watching how beautiful of a person you are but at the same time I do want you to know that I pray in your regard for your salvation of your soul all the time and I do wish you well and will continue watching your video.
Chris, meant and means a lot to you. Good luck to Chris. It is hard to loss people close to you. Chin up Jeffree.
What do you mean Jeffreee don't leave noooo
'a lot of things have happened' you literally got cancelled 💀
We love you so much ❤️❤️❤️
Omg i just realized his Christian and Maddie arent there anymore Omg thats so lonely 😭
Is it only me?   But I’m loving the no nails Jeffree!   Sending good karma so the right people come into his life
I hope everything goes good I know losing someone your super close to is hard. I just wish the best for you
NEVER would try to replace maddie or think i could however i am my own person and would not dissapoint

May your heart be filled with peace and endurance during this time of change and I declare Gods divine will be done in your life on earth as it is in Heaven in Jesus name

I've never been this early

ALGUIEN DE HABLA HISPANA QUE SEA TAN AMABLE DE RESUMIRME EL VIDEO ):

For a sec I thought you were saying goodbye and I was about to die 😭❤️
HIIIIIIIIII
Jeffer looking cute
You made it seem like Chris died!!!! Girllll
Yay I’m early!!!16 mins)   oh wait there is already almost 6,000 comments🤨
Hi Jeffree I’ll come be your personal assistant
Me: Sees the title  Also me: waits 15 minutes before clicking to see the comments explain to me what's actually happening
Why did I think Jeffree was quitting YouTube
I’m gonna miss them!!! I’ve been with since the beginning of the channel and this is a hard change. But best wishes to them both!!! We will always miss them and love them!!!🤍🤍🤍
The click-bait is real
I would literally move my whole life from Ireland to be your PA 😂 I am perfect for organising things
We love you and support you through all the ups and downs. No matter what, your loyal fans will always be here for you. Prayers and hugs.
Jeffree I’m extremely sad! I’m really hoping that you’ll be back!! I’m ready to jump in and be your full time assistant! @CandySoso_ on IG 💜🍬
I am so scared right now.
Stay strong beautiful! Everything really does happen for a reason 💕
Hey Jeffree I can use a job I live i do live in California I’m willing to travel as well !!!
Click so fast ever
Can I live with you I’m ready to start the next chapter in my life too??? 🤷🏼😅😂 Mold me into something great 🔮〽️⚡️  I’m 22 and I’m just ready to MoveOn ♏️
Sending Chris (and Jeffree) all the love 💜🖤💜🖤🖤
I never clicked so fast. 😅
Hire Shane Dawson to help you film.
I just feel a lot of this mini video was feeling sorry for himself. Real world issues, it’s a lot for me! I’ve lost my personal assistant and videographer! Bless you I lost my 3 family members to covid. And my job. And my sister couldn’t get the cancer treatment she needs. I know those issues arnt as big as your Jeffrey. And who can guess that the hair/makeup is for a photo shoot for mascara. He said ppl are saying the only time I film is when he’s selling stuff. Well let’s see how many videos he’s does before he launches his mascara. And I wouldn’t count this one. As I’m sure he is..
Doggie is so cute 😍
Not me thinking Jeffree is quiting YouTube 🥲
Jeffree what?!
Awww Sending Love!! People got to do what they Gotta do and yeah 2020 was rough all of us. You got this hang tough girl I’m sure you’ll figure it out and we’ll be here. Oxoxo
I really thought Jeffree was leaving YouTube... 😂😂
Damn this title scared me so bad 😱
Thanks for the update Miss Jeffree. Take your time choosing people so close to your inner circle. Don't hire friends. Ask some well-known people who is trustworthy and who is not. Shop around.
I will fly out there out of my own pocket for a chance to be interviewed by you.
Love the bow hair. Super cute
I'm so excited everytime you post a new video ❤️ I miss your regular uploads!
Opens this video * expects tea to be spilt * 🥺
Why is the Shane x Jeffree stuff on sale?
I love you so much queen!💗 there isn’t anything you can’t do !! You can do it all!! Keep your head up 💗💗💗
Anyone else just watch the dogs  the whole time? 😂
I snatched the bait. Now release me back to the ocean to die from shock.
💖💖💖💖 Chris
We are all going to miss Christian
I wasn’t ready for this year to begin with but I became a manger at the end of last year finally even though my old boss talked down to me like I was a dog and would only just be a regular employee. Proved him wrong doing closings and now starting to do openings again. I feel amazing having this opportunity with my new work place(same company different location), my grandma who’s about to pass on. Doctors told us she wouldn’t make it to 80 she did. Wouldn’t make it to her 81st well again she did. I pray I can see her one last time on my birthday that’s coming up in a month but once she stops eating that’s it. Less than a week...I’ve never felt with a loss before especially someone who’s blood. My husband who’s full time in college I’m full time at work it’s hard us not seeing eachother when we need eachother the most. Finally buying my first car this year which I’m so excited about! Something small. But it’s the the year of the Ox my year of getting myself back to normal. I haven’t felt like me since last year and now it’s fine for a change.
Hire me🙋🏻‍♀️
I would move in a heartbeat to be your new assistant . I just need Good healthcare insurance and permission to have PFPT once a week .
We can move to Cali
BYE CHRIS 💔💔💔💔💔
Apologies I'm too distracted behind you of 1 of the pups destroying the blanket. 😂 on a real level Jeffree I wish you the best to finding a good and safe person to help you shoot and edit videos. You could always ask Andrew if he could help for the meantime? Just as an idea I had ok love ya I'd stay but I have to go to sleep now it is almost midnight here where I am and I'm getting my lil butt up tomorrow at 6am to go to work. I'll just leave my headphones in and listen :) Night!  Live, as always, ~Mila🍭🧸
Aww well that sucks. Wish they would have stuck around to train their replacements. There's so much to learn trying to step into these rolls. Specially the personal assistant.... so hands on and constantly together 24 hours a day.  That's going to be so hard to train for from scratch.  Not only that building a new friendship and trust all at the same time
Thank god you’re not leaving YouTube 😭🥺
I'm just focusing on the dogs
I'm sorry but that hair is fire darlin!! 😍
Best of luck Chris and Maddie 💜🖤
Wish you the best. 🙏
I clicked on this vid soooo fast 😦
"Sadly there is no tea"... This how we should end professional and personal relationships, just the healthy way, without tea.
Good luck Chris and Maddie. You both have such a beautiful life ahead of you. I'm sending lots of love. 😊💛
I really need an assistant too 😜
if you are in need of a personal assistant im ready for the next chapter of my life too girl and its TO BE A MUTHAFUCKIN LYNN dm me on instagram @callmesooz im so serious i will send you my resume
Major shifts...can sometimes be a good thing.
Best wishes to Chris and Maddy. Hope you find some new amazing people to fill their shoes!
Never clicked so fast..  Heres y’all a little rundown: Goodbye Chris & Maddie. No tea, no shade in this video. Sorry guys.
OMG!!! YOU SCARED MEEEEE!
🤚🏽I will be your assistant!!! I'm free!!
Love love the hair!!!! Giving me anime vibes ❤️
What-

Shoutout to the comments with a resume about the video
😩 I wish I can give you a big hug rn ❤❤❤❤ I love you Jeffery praying for you !!!
HELLO U did GREAT making Ur VIDEO 👍 JOB KEEP GOING BOSS PINK 👑 ❤
❤️❤️
You are amazing, love watching you 💖🌷
Bitch I thought he was moving on but hes not so got it get it good next video  sis  💕
That was really dope to honor your employee/friend If you hadn’t messy folks would take issue with that  Jeffery Star ain’t some where living his best fuc_ing $life and that getting bag up
Jeffree star “saying goodbye” everyone clicking as fast as they can in a panic 😬
Hire me as your assistant jeffree! I gotchu girl !! 😬😬🙏🏼😇😇
i’m so sorry for what you’re getting through Jeffree, it’s gonna be ending soon🥺
*_doja cat looks weird here_*
Completely understandable and I hope you grow your work family again, soon. :)
Ok whew! It’s tough when you have to replace irreplaceable staff, but Lord I thought from the title it was going to be something else, so Thank you Jesus, Jeffree Star himself is not saying good-bye to YT!!!!  The right qualified people will find their way to you at the right place & time, & it’s fortunate this is happening now during quarantine verses pre pandemic when you’d have more to manage with traveling and engagements! Much love Jeffree & looking forward to your next ad launch, I’m living for the hair you were in today 🎀🎀🎀
Jeffree clickbaiting because a lot of people want to see him dissapear from the internet...
If Jeffree would respond I would get my life back together
I deadass wish I could have a day with Jeffree..😫💋
That hair!! Omg!  So sad to hear Christian is leaving 🙁 hopefully whatever & where ever he moves onto is amazing! All the best to him on his future endeavours! It's not the same to see you not so bubbly & over the top & happy but still love to see you sit & be real with everyone that loves you 💜 P.s. the best personal assistants are mum's lol they can multitask like non other ;)
**I'VE NEVER CLICKED SO FAST! AWW I'M GOING TO MISS CHRIS'S LAUGH & EDITING!** 🥰😍😘
Stan jefferee
Jeffree girl you need to get some folks who aren’t from LA to help you out. It really seems like LA is a lot of toxicity and I feel like someone from outside the scene would really be beneficial for you. Someone who wants to do what’s best for you.
JS you're so amazing to so many people, you've changed so many lives as well as they did yours. You got this
Maddie and Jeffree doesn’t follow each other on IG anymore ☹️
Jeffree have you shaved your eyebrows again or are you letting them grow?
Hi Jeff, do u need another dogs, i can bark :)
You can get through this stay strong girl! Love ya!
Jeffre not to be rudeeee...but I can’t focus what so ever on anything your talking about BECAUSE YOUR DOGS SO GOD DAMN CUTE OMGGGG any dog who dogs the blanket is literally 🥺🥺🥺🥺
Greetings from Poland ☺️
I’ll bend backwards and breathe jeffree star but I don’t know cameras or editing and live in Ohio 🤣🤣
ill miss Chris 🥺😭
love you jeffree, hope ur ok 💕
When you do get back on your regular posting we need them Trixie Makeup reviews. PERIOD.
It must be hard to lose two great employees and friends at the same time. I hope you find more amazing people to employ because there's a lot of not-so-good people out there and sometimes hard to find a trustworthy, great person, but you were able to with Chris and Maddie so I have hope ♥️
Damn this would be my dream job but I’m nowhere near California. Best of wishes to you Jeffree! I know you’ll find someone great 💖
If you're looking for a new assistant, I'm available...... Just saying. ❤️
Good luck to Christian and Maddie in the future 💗 definitely will be missed! And good luck to Jeffree on finding replacements
It must feel awful to have to address absolutely every change in your life because everyone automatically assumes there is tea to it.   I wish Chris and Maddi well on their new journey! I hope you find someone trustworthy to fill their positions.
First time to watch a video this early. 😂 and i was expecting jefree’s saying goodbye to youtube. Lol
Damn I legit thought you'd leave YouTube, can we get to a point where we expose JC for real real?
CAN I APPLY FOR THE JOB????!!!!!
You will be ok just keep doing what has got you to this point and someone will come thru for a camera man & assistant no need to panic. It was so funny watching the puppy and the others play fighting how cute are they. ✌🐕🐕🐕💜
💙💙💙💙
Hey Jeffree I feel I have a lot to offer as an inexperienced cameraman and personal assistant . I’ll work for free if I can sleep in your movie room
🎀 🎀 🎀
We love Chris with all of our hearts! He’s helped you produce so many amazing videos and we’re glad to be apart of your journey alongside his. We wish him the absolute best! ❤️ Your team is and always will be the best
Christian and Maddie are leaving!! Huge changes are coming... hopefully and thankfully Jeffree isn’t going to leave YouTube... fully! Hurry up new employees!!
Jeffree I need your help! My dad recently passed away with covid and I’ve become the head of household but I’m still sick from the side effects of covid. Anything will help me and my family. This is my cash app @rockingpunk175 god bless you
it funny how your two dogs a fighting in the back
Missed you Jeffree. Love you. Your puppies are beautiful. Your AWESOME and I truly enjoy your videos. Your a great honest person. Your gorgeous and a beautiful soul. Thank you. You want prayers, I'll be praying for you to have a peaceful time everyday.
Where can I sign up? Lol
Chris style was pretty awesome, going to miss his filmography. Definitely watch a lot of potential candidates to see if they match your feel/quality. Good luck dude
*JEFFREE I REALLY THOUGHT U WERE SAYING GOODBYE TO US I GOT SO SAD FROM READING THE TITLE IN THE NOTIFICATIONS!! U GOT ME!! I LOVE U THO* 😢😢😢 🥺🥺🥺🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣💕💕💕💕💕
Why all the theatrics and the hype for this lmao omg
Guys his not leaving YouTube if that's what y'all worry about :)
but really. delicious just chillin while others play fighting
Aww... we will miss Christian!
Rich white people struggles.. 🙄
Jeffree: saying Goodbye   My finger: clicked right away. Man! I'm such a simple minded person
There's always such big changes in your life. I would flip out, but your strong!! I know you will find the right persons for your life! Everything will fit into place :)
So good to see you again but I’m sorry for what you’ve been going through. Hopefully you find people just as amazing to fill their shoes. I’m sure it won’t be the same but maybe it can be just as good or maybe even better. I wish you the best and can’t wait to see what’s in the future for you and JSC.
Jeffree I hope you're ok. You seem very stressed. Your babies are getting so big ❤️. Sending you love and positive vibes. Sidenote: I ordered the new blood sugar collection and everything is gorgeous and arrived perfectly. And my order came in two days after ordering.... Great customer service as always from JSC.
I'm so sorry for ALL your recent losses. I can't believe it. I  know you're one he'll of a strong bitch so I  know  you will prevail.  So sad, love you Jeffrey 💋💞💪
Last video finally doing camera mans make up lol
I thought you were going to say Christian died! 😭
Good luck to your personal assistant and videographer in their new journey. Good luck to you too on finding ppl that can be as great as them.
❤❤❤❤❤❤
Who thought he was going to say Chris died from COVID?
If Jeffree pins this comment he/she will continue to be my QUEEN  P.S I love you Jeffree and we are all so proud of how far you have come and wish you luck on future plans and hopes it goes well.. I LOVE YOU JEFFREE ♥♥♥♥ P.P.S. Tell your dogs I said hi💕💕😘✌

I wanted drama. Nvm.
Here!!!! Never been early before!
OMG I love Jeffree so fricken much, I’m sorry to hear about some of his close friends moving on but everything seems to be going back to normal and hopefully he will be back and more badass than ever before!! I love your makeup, your realness,  and the inspiration you give to people!!! ❤️❤️
True fans are here for you and feel for Christian and Abby and support all of you! If not you, then at least Maddy and Christian. We wish the best for all of you. We hope the best for Christian and Maddy. Y’all will do the BESTTTTT no matter where you go in life. Especially with all the ups and downs that come with working with Jeffree. Y’all will have so much experience. We wish the best for everyone!
I miss maddy...... I get people move on just sucks when it does. It's crazy bc I always say live in the moment bc you never know when its done
Use Benny Solivan or Thatsocialmediaguy
Bitch I'll be your assistant. I'm 30 and I even live in Wyoming lol
You’ve got this girl! Praying for you! Sending those positive vibes your way. Loves you! ❤️❤️❤️
This is sad but atleast we still have you!!!  Hope all is well!!!  You look beautiful!😍
I will keep you in my prayers and I  love you I'm so emotional
Gurl you got me scared for a second 😂
........
MY HEART IS POUNDING STOPPPPPP
I love you jeffree always have since I met you at warptour 2011 stay strong come to Maryland i would love to meet you again
Change=Growth.. New Chapter, I hope its amazing! Xoxox
laughing at the baby tho in the background just having the best time
What camera is that ? It’s amazing 😍
I hear a lot of words but not a lot of info. Ok....So, Christian is gone. Maddie has been gone for a while now. Hope they both are off detoxing...lol.
<3 you Jeffree
Yall really are so gullible you cant see thru the clickbait title. Youtubers always be titling vids this way to make stupid ppl freak out when in reality it's just some boring and mundane news. Cracks me up
So this was fking clickbate byee ✌🏼
My anxiety would be through the roof if I were you. Good luck and I hope you find someone that fits into your life perfectly to fill these positions.❤️
Awww poor Jeff,wwwfff thought you were leaving youtube I was going to shout nooooo, awww hope you find replacements soon always hard to say goodbye but you'll be fine jeff xx
Hey girl I got you if u need a new carmera person !! I absolutely love you and everything you stand for !
Wish you the best!♥️
Jeffree! Even if you only want to make videos because you have a product coming out, girl do it! Who cares ?! It’s YOUR channel and your real fans are going to be here. 💗
I thought you were gonna tell us one of your dogs died again. ;-;
Thought he was leaving youtube for a sec...knew my queen couldn't let the world shake him.
97% of the comments: " So basically, this person and that person are leaving/moving on"
i would literally pack up all that i owned and move to cali in a heat beat just to be his assistant. it’s always been one of my dreams to work for such an idol❤️ my husband also does videography and photography ☺️
I wish I could help you out :( Best of luck, Jeffree, I know a lot is changing up and that can just cause anxiety and stress and such. I hope you find people you can trust <3 !
Don't scare me like that bruh! 😵
I saw that coming. But I am happy to know that there is no tea or drama. Also makes me sad because I’ll miss hearing Chris in the background and I’ll miss seeing Maddie in the videos. 💖 It’s definitely a lot to lose to huge assets like that that has been around forever. Change is also weird. I wish them both well. 💖💖💖
Im a young gay travel agent from Canada and would absolutely die to have the opportunity to plan one of Jeffree’s amazing vacations. I doubt he’d ever see this but hey 😌 putting it out there ✨✨
100k views in 5 united that’s insane
Everyone was early for a title like that
Jeffree - “there has been no drama”  Also jeffree letting hairbyjay do his hair and posting about it lmao
It got buried in my feed! I nearly had an anxiety attack.....talked myself down and found it!!  You sound do raw and nervous! Never have i heard you sound so authentic.  Good on you Jeffery.
I wanted the My cameraman does my makeup video so bad😪😪😪
Like the Queen of England, You will keep it moving like you always do 👑👌 Wouldnt mind being your Camera person but I'm in South Africa an not a fan of America at all. Your content is great though♥️ Keep posting!
Good luck on your search to fill those hard to replace shoes! Love you Jeffree!!
Can I be your new assistance !!!! Instagram @ musicologardx
He really going through the loss of two best employees but understanding at the same time. 🤗
Thank goodness for comments lol
Don't worry Jeffery we will be here for you, just take your time ❤ 🤗
You could use Andrew for your photographer . Oh nevermind
That thigh gap?
Thank you for sharing
I have been having a very hard time last year and the past few months with the loss of my father 4 months ago from being let go from my job without warning. Your videos have been helping me with staying grounded. I have rewatched your videos multiple time. So thank you for everything.
Stay strong Jeffree!! We’re here for you!! I know it must be hard to see them leave, since they have been with you for soo long they are as you said irreplaceable!! But look at how far you’ve come alone with them, they will have their own adventures now just as you will have your own exciting and bold adventures!! Just remember we will always be here to support and show appreciation for what you do!! Stay safe, surround yourself with good vibes and always remember we love you!! 💗💗
I’m just afraid of what I’m going to see.
Camera man, Chris and PA, Maddie left. No tea 🍵.
My heart SANK at the caption LMAO
New is always better, you got this baby.
So i left tiktok for this??
Not sure if you’ll see this Jeffree. But if you’re ever looking for a personal chef, I would love the chance to be able to cook for you. And your little fur babies of course 💕
Never clicked this video so fast!!  I’ve been refreshing YouTube ever since he posted the Snapchat!  - Also love this hair Color combo!  Hope everyone is doing good & staying safe xo - Legit got goosebumps when he started talking about maddie!
Shock
I wonder what he’s looking for in an assistant cause I’m generally interested I will find a way to move to LA
What's happening
Yess hunny💕 we love and support you and definitely understand life has it’s ups and downs🥰😊
all the tea channels gonna be here, then making stupid videos with ridiculous conspiracies.
I love these kind of just sit and talk kind of videos 🥰
11 minutes of nothing
People move on and do things that they want to and it’s good for them and jeffre will get another camera person and another assistant
Tea channels getting all excited then sucker punched 🤣 id love to be your PA I’m sure whoever gets the job will be amazing ♥️
Glad to hear your doing good and staying safe during this pandemic Jeffrey love you so much💋

You scared me there for a minute...
Totally dashed over stressing thinking you’re leaving here all together! Nearly got my hubby to go get the tissues 😂 Hope you’re doing ok honey? Tonnes of love to you xxx
it's not how much chris got paid, it's how chris stayed with jeffree through his ups and downs.. but I wish jeffree can find a PA & CAMERAMAN as wonderful and truthful as chris & maddy and I WISH CHRIS & MADDY the best! everyone deserves to be happy.. btw jeffree, since I'm not working yet how can I apply as PA? lol
I love you Jeffrey 💕
Just saw on Instagram 😄click the YouTube video fast asf lmao
Thank God it's not Jeffree quitting
🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏❤️❤️🙏🙏🙏🙏
Having Jeffree sit and being so down to earth means so much.
Loss is hard no matter if is family or friend and there is a grieving process until you adjust to the new normal... I hate changes I can understand those deep breaths. Is good to know that they are moving to better their lives but the feeling inside is hard anyway.
THERES A BETTER PERSON , WHY SOMEONE IS LEAVING YOU ❤️
I could have done without the heart attack!! 💔 Love the hair btw 💓
Guys no drama
Christian will be very missed😢😭
First
we never got a chris doing your makeup, video!!! 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Well we know one person who aint gettin the vaccine 😂😂
You got this! Still good quality! And as you said who ever comes next will be good 😌
Can't wait for the upcoming content! Best of luck on your journey.
Yea it’s sad to part with long time employees that you bond with over time. I know you’ll find someone who’ll create dope af content!! I can’t wait to see your next makeup review!!🥰🥰🥰
You are so strong and I love you
I am currently an Assistant for an accounting position, wish I could apply for his assistant position! I just know I would get shit done! lol Still wish him the best in finding a trustworthy Assistant and Camera man.

Love you queen❤️
Stay strong we love you♡
Aww we love both Maddie and Chris 💔 So sad 🥺

I mean I’ve always wanted to be a photographer and possibly even film. I barely have any experience though but I would like to learn.
I'm waiting for foundation..PLEASE
Keep on going and you will find whomever you're ment to find
I love you jeffree
Can I be his personal assistant 💅
Whelp I’m not a videographer. But I’m a damn good photographer would love to take photos with you. Posting this because I see you lurking 👀 😂
Jeffree I wish the best of success and I'm happy how you explained everything
Good luck you will find the right people
I'm glad they are realizing they need to move on with their lives and Jeffree is understanding of that. Some people would get angry at that and I'm happy they are able to step away and feel good about moving on to the next chapter of their lives
Pick me choose me love me @jeffreestar lol im trying to listen to jeffree but im so into looking at the dogs play 😂
Omg jeffree. I just hope that this doesnt affect you emotions in a bad way. My self im far away from my best friends its not easy, just keep in contact, and support your besties always wishing the best❤️  sending Lots of love💕 you got this ❤️
I've missed your videos and was literally just reading the comments on your last video, they're disgusting. Hope you're doing okay, Jeffree
❤️❤️❤️

The way he said it made me think Chris died for a hot min-
A new beginning <3

❤️
Your always in my thoughts and prayers Jeffree!! You hire some new incredible people to help you film and be your personal assistant!! Hang tough kiddo things are going to be ok sweetie
💕🥺you are amazing wish I could be as successful as you someday
This isn’t even tea but you already know this is going to be PLASTERED all over tea channels.
The fact that you said “ sadly...there’s no tea “, to Chris leaving. You should be saying THANK GOD there’s no tea & it was mutual and peaceful.
It’s crazy how right Jeffree is everyone always thinks drama drama drama but people change every day why would it be any different for him I only wish you Jeffree star the best wishes an I hope only amazing people come in to ur life from now on
I was having a rough day but then I saw this video and the title just made it worse
My best wishes to Maddie and Christian hope that they find the amazing opportunities that they deserve.  Sending you Jeffrey positive vibes so you can get through these major changes in your personal and professional life. Sending you love from Mexico City
What’s that white on the water line? I need that Ppl leaving is too much for the soul but sometimes you need a little bit of a person whose more free and has lived already. Where they have a family but yet no big ties, older than Maddie.  Me. I’m that person 😂 Since my husband died 3 years ago I made up my mind that I don’t want to marry ever again and my company is selling the property I work at so they’re about to get rid of us. I’m the one that they call on 24/7, hell I even fix things on my own and paint 😅
the moment i clicked it when it was uploaded and then when it has finished it has 6000 comments!!! I know him since my space era and keep following him up to date he is fun to watch not the perfect role model but he has a good heart and he has his flaws like we all do :) keep going love
JEFFREE DONT LEAVE USSSS DONT LEAVE USSSS🥲😪😪😪😭😭😭😭
I knew this was gonna happen, jeff needs time alone he always has alot of people around him,  things change life goes on friends become strangers even ones that were like family....I know personally.
I’m happy for you Jeffrey 🤎 Life always changes & that’s the amazing part about it. I hope you get to enjoy this time with family, friends & your babies 💖
I love you Jeffree!! Praying! Hoping for all the best! And I CANNOT WAIT for your mascara!!!💜💜
Hang in there! You know more amazing people will come to light and help create more amazing ideas and things ❤️
Jeffree I would love to work for you! I honestly think we’d be really good friends
Love u, however, all video I am looking at the dogs 🐕 🤪🤪🤪
I thought one of the dogs died when I read the title 😵😵
Dessert: being annoyed by his sisters and chilling Jeffree: Dessert stooop! Dessert: O_O
Why didn’t Chris say bye to us on camera? 😞
I love you!! Take your time, be careful out there and no matter who you pick, I’m still going to be here watching and patiently waiting for new and amazing content💕😘😘
Whaaaat Jeffree is not saying goodbye????!!!!!!
Girl you did NOT need to make the title this! We’ve all god PTSD from 2020 with YouTubers leaving! 😭
You saying goodbye to your hairdresser
Who else did not hear a word Jeffree said cause your attention is all on the doggies...I LOOOOVE YOUR DOGS JEFFREE...I could watch them all day.
On a side note,  that lil pup is adorable 😍
I still love you. I don’t care what anyone says.

How long did it take you to find people to do videos for you.? I’ve created a YouTube channel and doing it all alone right now. But I have so much fun. Or try at least
Wow. I started this video less than a minute after it was posted and cant believe how many comments already! Wow! I tried to be super early lol

Well this caused anxiety
Love you 😍

I’m sure you will find someone to fill those spots. Can’t wait to see what you do next
I’ve been waiting for your videos like I’ve been waiting for the black shade in your automatic liner formula. Best of luck to Chris & Maddie. And of course You. Can’t wait for your next launch. 🖤
Bitch don’t scare me like that! Lol ❤️

Jeffree I actually feel sad about these things, but I’m also happy that you are some sort of allright❤️ I wish Maddie and Chris the best and of course the same goes for you too❤️
Let me just say, I expected bad or sad news when I saw the title while it’s sad they moved on I can tell your happy for them and I’m happy it wasn’t bad or sad news
I would also be willing to relocate, and work for you! Alot of people would. Im sorry for your loss and I knlw its like losing a family memeber basically, but really, what about Andrew?
You are awsome! Love ya❤️
Really everything ok @jeffreestar , because you look kinda sad 😞 love you so much
Omg I can’t be the only one who thought Chris was like super sick or dying with how he said everything at first 👀 I was so scared.
Deep breath and keep on climbing!! Luv ya!
That one time ur gonna be pissed if its not clickbait
Did anybody peeped the brown dog lifting the other dog leg?😂❤️
We are so proud of you ❤️
dang that was something
My boyfriend heard me watching this and goes “do you want to move and be Jeffree Star’s assistant?” 😂
Also, you look so relaxed and refreshed. Self care queeeeennnn

The fur  babies are so cute.
HEY JEFREE I LOVE YOU , I love your channel and I understand you , take your time , we all have our own lives to live ❤️
Hate to see Chris and Maddie go but can understand. Hope you find people that give out positive vibes
I am positive you treated Chris well!! It will be hard to find someone you can trust! I wish you the best!
Lmao the thumb nail
Bye Chris! 💔
I love you sooooo much hope all is well
Can I be your new PA? I am not troubling 🤗❤️
I'm down to work today!
So pretty much Chris is leaving to do his own things lol. There’s no tea,drama. His assistant is leaving as well.
Let's be honest: I only clicked because of the Pom floof.
I liked Maddie
Oh nooo I loved hearing you talk to him in your videos "Chris what do you think?" "How's it looking Chris?" I'm gonna miss that☹☹☹
Me paying more attention to the dogs and not what he's saying 🤣🤦
ok i thought someone died but its just chris no longer filming for jeffree and maddie leaving
I’m a dope 50 year old woman that would love to help.  Prayers to you Jeffree. Love you 😘
Why u gotta clickbait us hunny
Bye lol
Drop the link for the personal assistant application sis 🤭
I would move to California!!! Just saying!!!
Take the time you need! They will do amazing things! Remember to take deep breaths band tell yourself youre doing the best you can and that's all that matters.
👎🏼
lmfao bye asf
Jeffree: Talking  about his camera man and former personal assistant   Donatella: *cute puppy chaos*

Jeffree honey, I hope the universe throws me your way. ❤️
I’m great with the camera
The hair is absolutely stunning 😍

If I were in the position to help, I totally would. You seem like the most straight forward, honest person to work for. 💚 Growth is totally hard. I hope you don't find yourself lonely. 🥰
Best wishes on your new adventure Chris!
take good care of yourself, doll ❤
.....don’t care..... we knew they left.... nothing in this video was important. Sorry not sorry. Karmas a bitch.
Does jeffree himself reply?🥺🥺🥺
I really wish I could work for you. I live in Arizona, though, and already have a hectic life. 😅
dude Jeffree “Changing your life routine wears you down” that is so tone deaf. people are going through much bigger problems then saying bye to an assistant,
Good luck and godspeed homie... I absolutely love u and ure videos and your style and swag... 🥰🥰🥰
I think Shane should be your videographer and Morgan your personal assistant
I got scared there for a second
Aww... your life sucks 🥱
Wtf is up with the background music tho?
What ever u think of him he has changed a lot and I think he has really matured and I think he is a better person now😀
Whoever’s reading this have a great day and take care of yourself 🥰
Dramatic
The Thumbnail tho
I love u so much jeffree
💖
Does anyone else think that Jeffree is going to do a collab with Elf?
wow. love this side.
Girlll you scared me :(
😢 The best to Chris and Maddie...
Love you! Hope to still see you at some point 🥰
I’ve never clicked something so damn fast😂
Omg! I would love to apply! Sounds so great.
I live in Wyoming 😉
I’ve never clicked in a video so fast, jeffree you are strong, you are a bad bitch and your have so much greatness coming for your and your company!
Breathe... miss you 🙏💋
Sending you the biggest hug and the best vibes
All my prayers goes to you and your family and friends....
Like nobody cares ...
I miss his giveaways.
Hugs to you Jeffree 🤗🤗
His views are going to go 📈 in this video
💜
I’d like too film you can my daughter come too
I'm so glad your not leaving YouTube! But that's sad that you have to say goodbye to your friend!
❤️
I’d offer to be your assistant but I’m lazy as hell an hate traffic 🤣
Is shane going to film for him.....?
I wish them the best, I know they’ll do great things. And I hope Jeffree finds trustworthy people. We love y’all 🖤
Good luck darlin, hopefully you find someone perfect and only slightly crazy XoXo

You will be okay jeffree take your time
♡
he knew what he was doing when he made the video title and description, he doesn’t care about anyone leaving his “team” he just cares about how many clicks he gets on his latest video.
<3
Awwwwww goodbye Chris. We miss youuuuuuuuu ❤️❤️❤️❤️ hugs Jeffree 👑👑👑👑👑
Awww, chris was the fucking best
Are you disabled you seeing this like you can do nothing by your self and thank people there what left you in your life but you don’t say nothing what we don’t already know 🙃 like we know you stop doing things because you already full your pickets with lots off money and now you just wanna chill..... that’s is fine just be honest don’t try cover everything because off pandemic 😷 don’t be fake
Jeffree we love you! God bless your wonderful people that have done so much for the YouTube channel will definitely be hard to replace ! Love you
But sorry about that

Jeffree’s energy is so calming, I watched this till the end. 💖
You’ve got our support!! Take your time and fill those two positions with quality persons

As long as you’re paying then someone would want to fill in their position
Scared the sh*t outta me .  Thought Jeffree was going to say he was quitting YouTube.  Sending Love 💕 & Positivity . @ Jeffree , everything will work out . I’d luv to meet you & smoke 💨 .  Praying for ease in transition in your life change isn’t easy for me either . ( I hang on with every fiber I have)
the things on your head look like wires
Love you Jeffree🖤🖤🖤

Your dogs give me such anxiety.  Please keep them out of your videos especially when they're barking or being distracting in the background
Saying goodbye is hard but change is good too.  You have had a lot of change in 2020. Everything will fall into place again.  Thanks for sharing. xx
💞
i skipped a funeral for this
Awe I hope you all keep in touch with each other
YOU ARE A BOSS!!! Your amazing🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰💋💋💋💋
Hope you can find people as close and trustworthy as you had. Watching the videos I could tell how close you were to both of them and you are human of course it will be hard to loose two close friends! All the luck for you in your future. Fuck what all the idiots say on the comments!
We love you Jeffrey 💜💜💜💜
Jeffrees attempt at being relatable.....

Clickbait
I love youuuuuu jeffreeee!!💕💕💕
Clicked so quick!!!!
Jeffree: “saying goodbye”  I never had so emotions flow that fast😭😅
Love you Jeffree!! How hard this time of transition must be.  Stay strong!
that’s great news lmao
Get a selfie stick and tripods film that shit yourself girl lol
Awh love you Jeffree. ❤️ praying for you and hoping you’ll be able to find more people you can rely on and trust. I’m glad things ended on good notes! ❤️❤️❤️
Keep that Crown held high❤️👑
Love you Jeffree,  stay strong ❤
Living for the pink hair bows! Godspeed
Damn, kinda crazy how everyone around you left to "move on" SIS MAYBE ITS YOU.
🥺
If u need a new assistant I would love to be ur assistant it would be my honor
Breath Jeffree, breath
So basically you are an obnoxious employer? Good job and enjoy your continued downfall as you become less relevant...
Love you Jeffree!!! Fuckin best person ever!
ok
Any person staying in a job/career 5+ years is a good sign. Usually it means their employer is decent.
Baby girl I WILL BE YOUR ASSISTANT. 😂😅😭😭😭😭😭
It’s not just to market your product but you only come back to YouTube when a product comes out bitch please
I know this is off topic but Jeffree i love your hair ❤️
Clickbaited me....
On god your hair is gorgeous !! 😍😍😍😩😩😩
awe . il come and help you xxxx
Do your thing Jeffree, wishing you best
2021 has been hard for me. Had a major loss in my life. Step forward as I am.
Ehh I don't really care about you
Did anyone else get scared when they read the title
New chapters are always opening, it hurts that people you grew to love have moved on to a new chapter as well. Just remember Jeffree, no matter how long and what route you take. We will always support you, take your time. Sending  All My 💗💗💗💗💗💗💗 You got this!💗👍
You got this ❤️ I believe in ya ❤️🥰
Mini orgy restock, all metallic palette with a mix of neutrals and colors called blood diamonds, and a FOUNDATION LINE, plz for the love of god. I’m only asking for everything 😭
You're amazing and I always look forward to what you have baking. J☆ 💙💙💙
You can hire me ❤️ lol I wish but I can dream!
I got so scared for a minute oof
Anybody here about any more mystery boxes launching I thought he said March or april? Please
Why did I even bother thinking he would address anything important
Wait... why am i so earlyy.
I saw saying goodbye and was like is jeffree leaving 😢😢😢
Such sad eyes :(
I hear Shane’s videographer is looking for a job, hire him!??
It's click bait yall. Continue to better videos
2020 was crazy but 2021 brings crazy changes and lots of hope.  You got this jeffree. You'll find some beautiful newness to your glam fam❤️
The whole time I was watching the doggies 🥲💗
bruhhhhh dumb clickbait
chris and maddy, we are gonna miss you 💛 you got this jeffree, im sorry for all this loss but loss leads to gain! and you made so many memories with these friends.
Like everyone I saw the alert said "WHAT!" and clicked so fast
Waiiit they both? Maybe he provoked them
Donnatella laying down on that blanket after being put down is a mood.
Wow...what a clickbait. Don't get me wrong I have had the closest of my friends move away, I have moved miles away from family-and damn it hurts. But still bit disrespectful to acknowledge people losing their lives and naming your video "Saying Goodbye" when an employee is leaving.  The drama is repulsive.
Wishing you the best jeffree !!!
Hi can we get an updated house tour?
Me... just watching Jeffree Star’s dogs be cute for 11 minutes
Congratulations to them! That is exciting news 💖🤘🏻 but no matter what happens, it’s going to be hella awesome. It can be exhausting and overwhelming. We can wait lol please take time for you and enjoy it! 💖
So for everyone who clicked on this video think Jeffery is leaving YouTube he ain’t
I love Jeffree but i dont believe there is not an issue there with 2 closed people with him leaving him...he is a millionare so the money is not an issue...
How y’all gonna hate when you take the time out of your day just to hate. Y’all weird😭
i love these types of videos from you. they’re sweet and it’s cool kinda knowing the behind the scenes.
It’s part of life.... moving on is okay 👍
“Changing your life routine wears you down”...I love you to death Jeffree but the examples you gave aside from the assistant changes sounds kind of tone deaf...this isn’t meant to be read as hate or anything but more concern for what people would think you know? A lot of celebrities got read to filth over those kinds of statements and it only made them Stress worse
I really thought you leaving YT. I about jumped out of my seat in excitement
Never clicked so fast!!
Wow I'm never early 😕
Honestly so happy for you I know you might feel all out of whack but as a Tarot and Oracle Card Reader I can tell you this is only going to help you grow even larger !!!
If you a personal assistant I’m here I have no kids just one dog I’m willing to rising everything to be your personal assistant
We will miss Christian And you have come a long way too Jeffery I remember when my best friend showed me your videos for the first time back when you only did music and had your crazy van warped tour adventures and you were a little crazy back then too haha and you have grown in to such a loving amazing heartfelt person and you have also changed so many people's lives and it has been a beautiful experience to watch you and your family grow, xoxoxo always love you forever and root for you and your dreams and it's been a fun ride on this fast Rollercoaster that is life 👠👜💄💋👑💍✌🌮🍦🍭🌹
If you would like to replace Maddy with another Maddy... I’m your girl 💖
Noooo not matty 😩 does she have Instagram
Chipotle Makeup???  Yassss!!! 👏🏻
7 minutes in, 117k views/ 5K comments.  Well Jeffree is staying 😊😊
I clicked fast for nothing
Faster than the light
Wow congrats Jeffree! I’m so glad! Everyone is moving forward to happy new lives!!!
I'm sorry to see your dear friends and employees leave to new adventures but greater things lie ahead!!!! ❤️
So you don’t have to watch: Jeffree’s videographer and personal assistant left
Or be your personal assistant... I'm good with that 😉
I am single no kids  very few friends but they are back in Mexico .. i would love to work for you
2 mins in and i never disliked a video faster🙄
❤
I'll volunteer to be your personal assistant I have 0 experience 😁
I have never clicked so fast onto a video so fast in my life bro
11:24 and there’s NO GOSSIP OR TEA   other than that title but that’s just misleading 🙃
ok quality
Not the vaccine!!! DON'T DO IT JEFFREE! DON'T DO IT! LOL
I want to come work for you!
I'm ready to be your assistant...wink 😉
Heck I can be a PA in Wyoming. I am so done with CA. Im older so no drama.
I’m about to graduate college I’ll be your assistant 😍
I missed you and the dogs ❤️
Can you lend me 100k till next Feb to help my mum out 😘
Sad that there's no teq
Wonder why everyone is leaving....
TLDR: videographer Chris is moving on and personal assistant Maddie has also moved on.
But lowkey that hair style is on period 😩
I keep refreshing to see how much people comments get per secondes like what 100 likes on a comment only 3 secondes ago
Can I be your assistant 💕?
0 view wow i feel like the first one
Alright! Who I have to kill to be your new assistant? 🔥😎⚔️
Obviously there is no tea here, bcoz if Chris has an issue with Jeffrey he wont stayed with hin for 5years... he is just really moving forward with his career.
This got me. There’s no drama but I’m sure people are gonna make something up on TikTok
I love your hair
There was absolutely no reason for me to click like that
Shane can film!  He doesn't want to be in front any longer, so how about behind the scenes?
I’ll come work for you and be your personal assistant! I love you and will support you forever!!
God Bless that camera quality
TLDR: jeffree isn’t leaving youtube, his videographer moved on :) Maddy his assistant moved on as well :) no drama or anything just different parts of their careers   Hope this helps!
It would be so awesome if Andrew did your videos in the future. He’s so talented 🥰
Does anyone think that them leaving has anything to do with the drama lowkey?
You look stunning 🤩  Better without nails 😬
Stay strong girl. Sometimes change can be good
Take me to Wyoming, I can help.
Omg I will miss Chris!!!!! 2020 and 2021 has sucked the soul out of us
Oh the puppy is getting so big and so cute
i really thought you were deleting youtube. i'm very relieved. i hope this year treats you better than the other years.
I've never clicked so fast wtf is going on???
I really enjoy your videos look forward to seeing more in the future I adore your iconic personality
We'll miss you Maddie
Aww I been thinking about you. Sending good and healing vibes
QUEEN OF CLICKBAIT AND MAKEUP!
What camera do you use 😭
Everything Eventually has to come to an end otherwise your stuck. It's called growing..... I don't understand how everyone can read the house down with no facts.
Ohh  Mmmeeee   I can be your new PA! B
we appreciate your honesty we love you <3
i have never clicked so fast on a video
Can't wait to meet your new team!
Wonder if Jeffrey and Shane are still friends
his videographer and assistant is leaving, that’s it yall
just clicked off after 10 seconds after reading comments that summarize what the video is about
Me distracted by the dogs the whole time lol
That's  cool my last names casey woot
Crossroad moments are tough, but the memories last a lifetime
Everyone in the comments "OMG NO TEA"  People should be in the comments like "OMG THE DOGS CUTENESS OVERLOAD"
And now I'm wishing I was a videographer...
I miss them to
Awww 🥰 hope Chris finds what he’s driven to and Matty does big moves and you find what your looking for in your new life
i’ve never been so early to something in my life. “saying goodbye” got me good, miss thing
JEFFREE FFS I SCREAMED SO FUCKING LOUD MY NEIGHBORS PROPROBLY THINK A JUST GOT MURDERER  * SIGH *  everything is fine ... GODS my heart almost gave out
I can’t even imagine trying to figure be a new Maddie!! What can I do to be picked?!
Me waiting for Jeffree to run a contest like reality tv series to get more staff
11.5 minutes to tell everyone your camera guy and assistant have moved on? Okay.
In other words, his camera man left and his assistant left as well 🦧... he isn’t saying goodbye.
Love you jeffree!!!
early
5 and half years making vid what I cried
*Click bait he’s not leaving Christian is.* Everyone is leaving him last was Maddie several months ago and they also unfollowed each other on social media.
♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️king ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
Here before 1M.
People in Wyoming have forgotten hobbies
As soon as I read the title, I was on it, thankfully I had notifications turned on
Sorry to see Chris leave 😢, but who else was distracted by Donatella chewing on the throw, she’s so damn cute!
My god.. his camera is clearer than my vision
Bye
Here for the all of the TEA in less then 10min! 💖u J🌟
Girl, my heart went to my asshole when I read that title!! Lol thank god you aren’t leaving us I would DIE! Christian, we will miss ur cute accent and skills! Jeffree, good luck finding amazing new family members to join your amazing life! Looking forward to the future. Love u betch! ❤️
He made such a big deal about this for pretty much nothing I got clickbated
I love his "bears" 🤗🤗❤🤗
U should record you getting the vaccine
Yeah but why you still got your hair stylist? Shouldn’t he be leaving.
Aww I’m sad to see maddie and Christian go :(
The videos don’t have to be professional we will still watch. People more interested in the quality shouldn’t watch.
NOOOO I clicked on this so fast for what ? Ur not leaving why please for my insanity I might die LEAVE
So proud of you and I can’t wait for the next chapter of YOUR life ♥️♥️♥️ thank you for sharing this you are extremely strong
wheres Diva
God bless you, your channel & all your future endeavors Jeffree. I don’t know you like that but as a human I want people to see you as a human as well. That part...Take care❤️
Ok....my heart is beating fast I’m at work too
Phew though was saying goodbye to youtube 😅 cant keep my eyes off the doggies ♥️
Your dogs are so beautiful thier God's little Angels
OK I love this background.. sunny and fresh and cozy and of course the dogs! 🐶💕
Omg whatttt
You should put in an ad at the university for students that’s are about to graduate from videography. 🙌🏻🙏🏻❤️
ms jeffree you scared me with that title
noooo
So nice to know it’s not a tea filled video
I’ll come work for ya!!
Not to be that person, but... both chris and madi left at basically the same time? Sus.
i love you, you’ll get trough it 😘😘😘😘
Nobody :  Me clicking as soon as i saw the title : 👁👄👁
Holy clickbait
Looking gorgeous as always 😌😌
Hire me babes
UGH I’ve missed J* so much. Thank you for blessing us today babe. Also, your hair is fucking DOPE 💖
Getting ready for this. I’m nervous of the news you have to tell
This is kinda a cute video, ending a chapter, but like wtf I was almost crying bitch 😂😂
I'm actually so glad there's no tea. I'm so sick of drama and anger, it's nice to see y'all parting ways nicely.
As soon as this video uploaded I clicked so fast I beleve I broke my finger
Anyone else more focused on the dogs or...
Damn some of y’all are heartless. When you’ve been working with someone for so so long, it can take a lot out you physically and emotionally, on both parties. Not everything has drama involved. Great for Maddie and Christian for looking forward into their careers. Wishing them the best and the best for others looking to change their path.
Clicked so fast I watched in 2x speed to get the deets first lmao
Omg 💗💕💖 YOU ARE STRONG 💗💕💖 YOU ARE BLESSED ⭐️ I love you forever 💗💕💖
Hey Jeffree I love you so much I hope you are doing well xoxo
Hi
Came from Twitter so fast💕💜
Loved it💞💙
Jeffrey always wishing you the best. Sending love from Miami 🌞
Omg bye Chris, we'll miss you.  I almost thought it was Jeffree who was leaving us, ugh what a relief. Miss you Chris.
me before reading the comments: "wtf's happening"                   after readin the comments: "oh there's no tea...byeeeeeeeeee"
I guess it was too good to be true, God I hate clickbait.
Major click bait. The way he’s trying to seem ‘authentic’ with the camera shift at the beginning. I can’t.
I’m never early. I had to watch this immediately😭 this better be clickbait
I thought it was something more important, I really wanted him to leave YouTube after everything for all the disgustings things he has done but I guess is too much to ask
Umm THIS CAMERA GIRLLLL!!! IS THIS A MOVIE???
Okay where’s my application??
James Charles had so much excitement the moment when he saw this click bait
Sending love and good thoughts your way. Lots of change is hard.
“Not going to meet and greets, not traveling, it really wears you down” So THATS why I’ve been depressed my whole life😖
Love u Jeffree !!!!!!
I don’t have $$$ 😱🥲 anyways love you
I was missing you so much so happy for them but I miss you and your videos good luck Maddie and chris
Good seeyaaa!
You can never say goodbye to us !! ♥️♥️
He is moved to Wyoming. I doubt they are going to follow.
How amazing looking at the dogs activities while Jeffree talks
People come and go in my life all the time.... so I understand
Ima miss Maddie 😭
But why did/are they leaving?
Thank you for this, I like the honesty in this video.
If i knew anything about camras i would totaly help u jeffree but i sadly dont and its ok to vent we all need that space to do that sadly i dont really do that and i really should but i dont i keep it all in but anyways im glad ur doing ok and ur still staying here with us id miss u so much if u ever left i remember fallowing u on myspace way back in the day
Well this was very disappointing!!!!!!
When I tell you how fast I clicked...
The hair is amazing!!!!!! 💞💖💞💝💝💖💞💖💝💖💞💞💖💝💝💝💖💞
Awwww
Jeffrey: “I had to go pee and get a drink, sorry if that’s too personal”  Me: “BiTcH! We family.. nothin too personal”
Its the 🧚‍♀️✨CAMERA QUALITY✨🧚‍♀️ for me
i cant be the only one who is looking at the dogs-                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     hi if u see this lol
People who don't like this video are the ones jealous and want your success jokes on them something called "work hard in life" don't worry support you Jeffery
Glad that everything is ok Jeffree! Thank you Chris for all this beautiful memories!! Blessings in your new chapter!! Wish you the best!! 🙏🏼✨❤️
At first I thought he was quitting YouTube because his videographer was leaving 💀 Like girl just get a new one
We love you💕🙏🏻
Don't get that poison! Do research!
I’m in Wyoming. Snap your fingers if you need anything!
Damn Maddie too? She was a sweetie
I used to put my girls' hair in bows like that when they were little! You have me wanting to go do my granddaughter's into a big bow now! LOVE the look!❤ Will be here WHENEVER you are back at it!

When I first clicked on the video I liked because I thought he was leaving YouTube 😂😂
All your friends... GONE 🤡
He seemed so sad while telling us those news ❤️ we love you Jeffree ❤️
*click bait* smh.....
How do people even notice that stuff!
Playback speed 1.5 x  😎
"Sorry I really had to pee and get water. I know that's a little too personal"  That's too personal? That's how I talk everyday 🤣
Wait..he looks like tana
Hey jeffree you looking for a new personal assistant....
❤️🧡💛💚💙💜💖
This is so full of love. We wish them both the most beautiful and prosperous 2021!
I FEEL BADDD Like Jeffree lost half his friends-
On my gosh I was seriously so worried before clicking on this video.
Hi
Wishing for nothing but the best for Chris and Maddie!!!
Sorry I’m not up to date with all the dogs names but the left side is Jeffery on the outside and there right is the Jeffery on the inside 🤣
I literally LOVE vlog Jeffree. It’s so fun seeing him hold his own camera
Waste of my time
Earlier than he says good bye
Love how his videos get more likes and views in 1 seconds that all of my posts on Instagram had ever...
I’ll take any job, jeffree!
eso sí Jamás
I thought you were quitting😅
Ill be your personal assistant.
I like this film style, feels like a vlog🤍
I would LOVE to work for you. It would be a dream
This is so sad JEFFRY LEAVE fuck for my insanity please 😞 I was really thinking he’s leavening
spoiler: chris is leaving, no tea or drama. you're welcome you can leave now if you want.       also who else was scrolling through the comments to see if he finally quite?
Not me thinking he was gonna commit suicide.......
So dramatic for something so underwhelming
We will miss you Guys❤️ Also, Jeffrey I’m so proud of you through everything. You got me through so much and showing me no matter what, one day I can achieve my goals and eventually have my own home. But in summary, I love you and you have my full support. If you ever need me as an employee I’d be so honored.
Oop- Jeffree's whole team is leaving 👀

Never clicked so fast! I'm glad hes not leaving! Cant wait to see what's next
💜
Me watching 2X speed so I can get through it faster for my anxiety
This is crazy.
Maddie and Chris are leaving. Video summed up <3
Wah wah wah wahhhh 🎺
❤❤❤❤❤❤
Chris!!!😟😟
Who did your hair?.. ^_^
Sir I dont think i have ever clicked so fast 😅 😳
Im looking at the dogs the whole time
Aw Chris! he’ll be missed 🥺
And I was not wanting to throw myself off a bridge🙄
Look outside of L.A. for someone new to film for you.
Goodbye Chris! We will miss you! Thanks for filming all the videos you did and giving us these memories with Jeffree! ❤️🇬🇧
I was focused on the dogs the whole time 🤣🤣 they are so cute
this is click bait
Is that a new dog ?
Wish your friend all the best on the part of his life .. Im Sure you'll miss your friend but remember it all happens for a reason.  ❤❤ smile 😃 ...
Of course a rich person is getting their vaccine before we could get it

glad maddie got away
Good luck you TWOOOOO! 💕
We love you jeffree!!! 🥰🥰🥰
EARLYYYY
Good luck and have fun Chris and Maddie!!
Looks like hibernation is over and the skunks are out. Nice to see another phony video from you, Mr Star. Make makeup tutorials and focus on actually informing people on how to do makeup instead.
everyone sees jeffree as this powerful controversial person but in reality he’s human and people need to realize this.
What the video is about; his videographer and assistant are leaving him and he’s sad about it  You’re welcome
He has like all the money in the world.. but I think he is very lonely... Jeffree I‘m here for you. 🙁
Why didn't you do a video about Maddy leaving, like we all thought you guys were close friends.
Sending so much love and support from Seattle! Things happen for a reason! Stay positive and keep your chin up! ❤️
Oh 😃 my bad I thought he’s leaving YouTube
Lmaooo
Love you Jeffree.
resume?
My finger hurts from clicking so fast
Fuck why jeffry just leave for my mental insanity please ✨ I’m asking nicely
°¿°
Seriously....
*Where can we sign up for videographers and editors?!?!? Hahaha*
Playback speed 1.5 lessssgooo!
hello jeffree stay safe i love your make up i hope you and your mental well being is okay bye
Tl;dw  Entire video is a list of explanations why his content has slowed down: His videographer Chris is leaving  His personal assistant Maddie Lynn is leaving  He’s been living at his ranch in Wyoming
First second into the video ; confused!   Intro into the point : get to the point jeffree   Explaining :    Is that it?   Further explained: no tea?   Further further explained : ok kinda sad   Final thoughts : not jeffree star approved                             Just get one of the dogs to film ur YouTube videos, although going from seeing someone everyday to them moving away is understandable but I just thought it was gonna be more, but no hate
Well damn
I clicked fast !
WTF is Chris(??
for anyone doesnt wanna watch the video >>> Chris is leaving, maddy is leaving and jeffree isn't leaving YouTube
Kinda sad to see Chris and Maddie leave, they were so good 🥺
I love you! Keep your head up you will find the perfect person for you.
If you want a new assistant I’m right here bitch 💕
Saw this on Insta.....Was about to cry
You were so scared you came to the comments first .-.
Jeffree Lynn, these titles are so dramatic.
Maddie will also be missed best wishes for her 🥰
over 100,000 views in 5 mins😅
For the people who stayed say “i”
I love you Jeffree and I understand
...new editor and personal assistant. How wild!
Talk About click bait 🤔
bye chris!!! we’ll miss you ):
Clickbait worked on my ass too lol 😂
Can i be your videographer. I  live on the islands  🥴 take me out this hell  😘
We never got a video of Chris doing JS’s make up </3
❤️can’t wait to see what the future brings
I love you ♥️
Biggest clickbait of 2021
So much clickbait
Anyone knows Chris IG? 💕
Basically his team is disbanding
PLEASE THE TITLE IS SO DRAMATIC AND FOR WHAT
What a waste of time.  As usual a big f****** drama queen and a lot of heavy breathing.
So “saying goodbye to my cameraman” ...
I'll do it 🤣
Jeffree don't do that 😅
happy for them & also for you. it’s always good to keep learning & growing.
As long as your not leaving us we love you!
Paying attention to the dogs more than jeffree..... lol they're so cute!!!!!!!
I wonder how much the camera man of Jeffree Star got paid....
I am just sitting here watching the dogs play
Oh to be someone with millions of dollars, pink hair bows, a fancy robe and several Pomeranians.
Calm down have another Red Bull
Yea....no. Bored.
So glad people are growing ❤🥰 love to all
Tea
Girl you had us all scared Sorry for all that’s been going on with you!
I’m sorry bby and I so don’t want to be insensitive or heartless but I just wanted to know if you were going to be looking for a replacement
Aww omg happy for Chris 💗 he will be missed and i wish him the best!!
2020 was not a good year for him at all. I think he is a massive drama Queen and I don’t doubt for a moment he will stomp on someone to make money or save his butt. However, this is why we love him. It will sound bizarre,  but there are few genuine people who are famous who are genuinely nice and lovely. Jeffree reviews needs to come back and he needs to stop just coming here for drama and sales. We want YOU on here, your crazy life, your tutorials and your dogs. The rest gets views sure, but it’s not what your fan base want. Make the time for us and we will continue to support you xx
🥲🥲🥲🥲
Take your time and choose wisely! The world is crazy so trust your gut
Bless Chris! He’s been such a loyal gem to jeffree! Good for him for putting himself first and doing something for himself!💜Good luck Chris!!😚
Chris and his assistant left, that's what the video is about, nothing important, no drama no nothing, so if you are reading the comments while watching you don't have to watch anymore.
JEFFREY! DONT PLAY WITH MY HEART LIKE THAT EVER AGAIN!
I legit thought Chris died, god bless he’s alive 🥲
Heyyy!
Gurl what did you do to him😭💀
Jeffree your make up & hair looks so gorgeous 😍 Also I’m glad your not feeding into the drama. Just do you & work it girl 💜💜
Okay hire me!!
You low-key looking like me... hi Vinci!
i’ll come film lol
Wow I wish I new how to do that stuff
awww
I’ve never clicked so fast..💔
I thought u was gonna talk about the drama going on about u 😂
CHRIS!!!!!!!! he will be remembered tho btw at the start I thought he died :(
"a lot of darkness in my life" yeah... caused by you?! the way you treat people?! I'm ashamed to have ever supported you or your company.
The dogs fighting on the couch sent me 😂
My heart dropped when I saw the thumbnail. Someone come revive me💀
Does anyone have a time stamp for when he announces the news?
When the only way you can get the views now is clickbait titles.
CHRIS 🥺🤍🤍🤍
I just 💩 myself thinking that jeffree was saying goodbye to us on everything and quitting everything 😭😭😭
That beginning with Jeffree struggling with the camera is everything😭   I wish you the best Jeffree ❤️
First it was Maddie now its Chris.... what's really goin on
i’ve never clicked this so fast
You hear that? It’s the sound of tea channels snapping their fingers trying to get the first video out
Unpopular opinion: *I still like Jeffree Star.*
Time for Andrew step in?
Awww I suspected that it was about Chris!! It saddens me because I always loved hearing his comments and his laughter in the background. Wish him the best!! ❤ love you Jeffree!! xoxo
The babies in the back 😍
“There’s no tea” *leaves*
Is he leaving YouTube or what
4 minutes in...Gonna miss ya Chris. Good luck to you & your new adventure your going to have after this.
👺👺
You should hire Andrew 😃
Of course he left 😆 Madison is gone, Nate gone... they know a sinking ship
*Me thinking he’s leaving YouTube*  About a camera man...
WHO ELSE THOUGHT JEFFREE IS MOVING ON?😂
“it’s hard to trust people” girl what
Who else thought he was going to say Chris died at first based on the way he started talking about him?
Love u always
He means so much to me I don’t even show him .
Everyone's taking off
Best of luck Chris.
Chris the cameraman is leaving and ofc Jeffrey takes the chance to put this dramatic title 😂🤦🏻‍♀️ Is anyone surprised tho?? 🌚
I'll come work for u . I need a change!
Chris is such a talented human being and I hope he fulfills his full potential in life because he deserves it ♥️
Not Chris 😭😭😭😭
Click bait.
Shane is good and editing why don't you ask Shane to help
I am sad we never got that video with Chris where Chris does Jeffrees makeup 😭
Can I come work for you?
He’s not saying goodbye to YouTube 💀
Hope you are doing okay Jeffree ❤️
So this is about Chris & Maddie leaving? 👀
what
are we surprised 😃
For anyone who doesn't wanna watch the whole thing: His videographer is moving on
Damn it I thought you were actually leaving YouTube. Still waiting for that day cuz you don't deserve a platform
I was scared you were going to say you were leaving! I’d die if you left Jeffree! I’ll always be your side! ❤️ 😘 sorry to see Chris go 😢 to bigger and better things!
Praying for you Jeffree. I know good things will come your way when you put good out in the world. That good will come back and bless you.
Really talking about someone leaving......AND NOT WHAT HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR A YEAR AND A HALF!!!
The PANIC attack when I thought you were leaving Youtube!  I was like "Goodbye? Goodbye to WHAT bitch??!!! What do you mean GoOdByE?!" 😂😂😂... Like I'm sad they're moving on, and I'm sure you'll miss them but don't SCARE ME LIKE THAT 😂
ANDREW!! ANDREW!! ANDREW!!!!
Jeffree: “There’s no tea, there’s no gossip, there’s no drama”  Me: 👁👄👁
Just trust your intuition like you always do
Where is the drama?!
Bless I hope Chris moves on to something that is amazing for him!💖
Time to hire Casey neistat as your videographer
Ms. Jeffree, Can I be your videographer please?
OMG my heart felt so heavy when I saw this don’t scare me Jeffreee 🥺❤️
So ,JS is staying 😒
Gurl what did you do to him😭💀
“Sadly there’s no drama”
Who else thought Jeffree Star Cosmetics was shutting down? On a side note, Jeffree, if you need a cameraman, call me 🤙!
This video is just straight-up clickbait. Come on Jeffrey you never actually respected any of your employees or actually spotlighted their work before,  you just use them for clickbait. Just like your dumpster fire of a career.
Can we talk how people’s comments get so many likes like what!
Best of luck, Chris 🤍🤍🤍🤍
Still no nails, and no way of accepting what you should truly find in life. And its not the material 🤣🤣🤣
B I thought jeffree Dahmer was quiting
Can people stop beeing rude, he’s still a human... and all humas make mistakes! Grow up people, if u don’t like him than DON’T WATCH HIS VIDEOS!  ❤️
PICK ME
Awwnn good bye Chris, good luck and be happy, thank you for everything you have done for this channel and Jeffree, we luv u 💕💖💗💝
Your dogs are precious🐶🐶🐶🐶🐶🐶💕
Jeffree!! You gave me a fucking HRART ATTACK!!!
I mean...Maddie is not following him and viceversa soooooo
💗💟💜
Girl ... cross your legs ... 😉
The fact this has over 100k views in 4 minutes is insane. That's gotta be a record.
I’ll summarize, his videographer is leaving and his assistant has moved on.
Couldn’t pay attention to what Jeffree was saying cause the dogs adorable fighting distracted me
Chris and Maddie are moving on with their lives, no tea. You’re welcome
Can we talk about why Maddie left ?
Omg i was so scared that you were saying goodbye and i was like noooo dont you dare ! I need my jeffree fix ! Haha Love you jeffree 💓 hope you find the perfect people to fit your world and reflect your personality to the fullest of what it is 💜 sending love from Canada 🇨🇦
One point for you, Jeffree! I took the bait. Lol 😉👍 good one! 🤪
Love u booooooo
I was like 34 seconds to when he published lol
So... the camera guy is saying good bye 👋???
Love ya girl! 👋🏼🥰
He acks  like his life so hard  yeah right he has it made no worries  no stress no shit  he can go and do and whatever  he what's
Nobody cares
4.5k comments in less then 4 minutes this mean no one actually watched the video before becoming this internet trolls
Fake affffffff waaaaah complain much
ok.. phew... i thought.. that you were quitting yt and i was gonna cry.. we love you jeffree
I was curious about maddy because I haven't seen her in ages😂
Talk about freak out sooooo much then watched and this is worth watching
ELF has good influencers promoting their stuff! Their PR team is nailing it!
bought a pink Lamborghini just to race with china
I love how the dogs are just playing in the back ground
It’s hard saying goodbye to important people in your life but it’s a beautiful thing to watch them flourish. My mentor in my current job is moving to a new position and it’s made me very sad. But I’m so happy for him to grow and be who he’s always wanted to. Best of luck to them both. 💜
POV: you were hoping there was tea but literally nothing so you clicked off 4 mins into the video
Gets distracted by the puppy chewing the fringe on the blanket
No one: Me: distracted by the dogs
I’m trying to watch but I’m distracted by your ADORABLE fur babies!!! 🥰🥰🥰
Let’s take a moment of this BEAT!!!! Sis she did that !!!! 👽 💄
Jeffree, you are amazing and you will always be in my heart! Hugs to you and to Chris. Good luck to him on his new journey 💕 Maddie also!
He's saying goodbye to Christian. That's it. All those that came here hoping there would be drama or something else to "hate" darlings, get a life. He's just saying bye to Christian as Chris is expanding his horizons & also to Maddy as she has found new things. Jeffree supports that, as a good friend should. End of video.
NOOOO MADDIE LEFT THAT MAKES ME SO SAD. AND CHRIS LEFT AS WELL. FOR ANYONE WONDERING XX
His videographer is leaving from the channel, and to move on btw
My 8 year old says, Mr. Starr .... you look beautiful 😍
Jeffree: "sadly there's no tea"  Tea channels: "damnn it"
Glad everyone is well.
ITS A CLICKBAIT DONT WATCH IT HE JUST SAYING BYE TO HIS CAMERA MAN LMAOO WHAT A LAME
I paused Handmaids Tale cause I thought this was super serious. 😳🥴
If nobody wants to watch, I’ll save you the time, his cameraman is leaving and his assistant is leaving too. Boring just click bait
Ooohhh nooo 🥺❤️🖤
Jeffree: Saying goodbye... me: Thank god!
Who here didn’t even know who Chris was before this
Gurl sending love
Saw this nearly had a heart attack!! Then saw the comments. Thank god
I guessed this earlier from the teaser. I wish them both well. I don't have mad videographer skills lol...but I would be a great assistant though and I live in Los Angeles. 😁
Hey Jeffree 👋 I see all the help you do for others. Just know it doesn't go unnoticed 💞 Can't wait to see what the next "Chris" brings for you 😉
O.M.G.   ^♡^

As long as the new cameraman isn’t the one from the Blood Money reveal, everyone else is ok, I guess. 🤷‍♂️
How do you keep your dog's from fighting? They must get a lot of attention from you. My dog's will fight bec of jealousy. I hate it. My little Pomeranian thinks she's as big as a bit!
His Videographer is leaving.. no Tea 💀

Omg I'm so early
Me: *Reads title of the video  me again: "WHAT?!?"
Since you’re gonna read this before watching (like I did) 😂 : Chris (camera dude) is leaving. And Maddie (assistant) is leaving. Our beloved Jeffree is going NOWHERE!! 😁  Have an amazing day ❤️

Well this was a waste of time
Click. Bait.

POV: you didn’t know you were still subbed to Jeffree and now you’re clicking unsubscribe 🥰
Sadly no tea☕

Great friends are hard to come by  these days. At least you will both always have each other and all of the memories made during those 5 and a half years!!!

Don’t worry I would leave to if I was Chris
My heart stopped for A SEC. I thought this was bye sister 2.0 lol
Jus gonna say their channels ( James Charles and Shane , jeffree) didn’t turn well.
Is he actually leaving youtube so he is not posting another video again?
POV: you thought Jeffree was finally going to address the drama
The gossip is real this is not HEPPENING someone tell me this is not happening.
I love a transparent, honest, direct conversation Sometimes change is needed, even though it may be harder than we think I hope you feel better soon 🤍 Sending you and your dogs a big big hug 🤍
omg i’m gonna miss chris AND MADDIE TOO
I really thought Jeffree was saying goodbye to YouTube
Pov: You're nosy af for more drama
That wig is awful. Must be Hair By Jay
Why is this giving me mob boss druglord vibes?.
Omg what happened are you okay?!
Thought the video was about something different

You’re such a drama queen.
I totally wish I could pull off this hair.  How does he make this look normal?
i was ready for drama 😭
I’ve never clicked so fast in my life! Good luck Chris! You will do amazing!

This was a let down. 🤷🏻‍♂️

Oh I thought it was supposed to be something REALLY sad but ok🙃

Reason for the video—   Chris is moving and leaving the channel. No tea, no drama. You’re welcome.

I’ve never been so early to video before
too early, i was counting on the comments to tell me what the video was about...
Imagine chris slept with kanye 😂😂
the way this man uses clickbait titles to stay relevant is hilarious 💀
this is not what i thought it was going to be🧍🏻‍♂️
THE ONLY TIME I DIDN'T KNOW WHETHER THIS IS CLICKBAIT OR NOT JUST COZ IM TOO EARLY AND NO COMMENT ANYTHING ON CLICKBAITING
It's not tea
Awww I love seeing the pups
I'm drunk...

being this early on a jeffrees video is so weird
hmmm.... I feel like something big is gonna happen... someone’s gonna get called out & people aren’t gonna stick around on the internet to even deal with the drama. Lmao
HE SAID NO DRAMA OR TEA 😭
Its annoying how he plays the victim....and DOES A BAD JOB AT IT
1:50 is to skip past the shit
We love you Jeffree
Hahahaha. Some of y'all thought he was leaving. Y'all big mad?? 🤣

Awww shame they are leaving, wonder how long itll take for them to put out an "expose" video?
yall are saying “hopefully this isn’t clickbait” buttttt you’re on his notifs so??
If there’s no drama why the title clickbait
The title = billions of views which = a six figure check while the queen heals.

He was waiting that long to spit it out, to have people stay around long enough to qualify for views..... click bait. Lame.
I see ole shitty Jay is still putting wig’s on your head. Start saying goodbye to the shitty company you employee and keep around you sis. Sounds like all these people leaving for good reasons bravo to them.

If you write ANYTHING on your computer, YOU NEED TO GET GRAMMARLY. I write pretty much ALL DAY every day and GRAMMARLY makes my writing better. As a student I like that it's FREE It actually is... correcting everything as I'm writing it. Grammar errors spelling errors... IT EVEN helps me find the right words to use!! SO I can say what I want to say!! It catches all those embarrassing little mistakes BEFORE I HIT SEND!!! I download GRAMMARLY around my freshman year becuase I was just... Ｈ Ｏ Ｒ Ｒ Ｉ Ｂ Ｌ Ｅ... at typing! Grammarly is like my secret weapon for writing papers. It's just the PERFECT tool for your resume, you know you don't want ANY errors when it's your first impression. I use GRAMMARLY for important emails, social media posts (which there are a L O T of.) I've used EVERY TOOL OUT THERE!! And Grammarly is by far the ＢＥＳＴ for improving your writing. GRAMMARLY is making me a better writer. AND it's free... I would recommend GRAMMARLY if you're a student, my family, my peers, my colleagues, It's like having YOUR OWN personal proof-reader for free
PLEASE BRING BACK THE NEON YELLOW "HIGH, HOW ARE YA" SWEATSHIRT! My little boy ruined mine 😂 Love you! EDIT: Good luck, Christian! Wish you nothing but the best! 😊

Never been so early in my life 🤣🤣  Honestly though, 2020 was really crazy and maybe this change is good for you? Getting new energies and vibes to surround yourself with. Ya it’ll be difficult to find them but I think whoever you pick is going to do amazing and put in 210% to helping you. I hope you, the pups, and your friends and loved ones are doing good and have a good rest of your day!!! 😊👋

Hi
Goodbyeeee
Omg hiii
Broo clicked so fasst
I’m scared, I love you Jeffree! Keep your head up. I’ve been going through a lot of stuff lately too. My mom got married to this man that she hardly knows and this man has made my mom turn her back on me and so now I feel like I have nobody and it sucks. He moved in and she took my car and told me I couldn’t live with her and I’m a junior in college and I lost my job and I feel like I have literally nothing. But your videos always make my day better! I’m so glad that you’re not leaving youtube!! If you would like to help me, my cash app is $jasminecooperxo, I hate asking for hand outs but I know you love helping people and I’m the same way. If I have it, my friends have it! Thank you for everything you do! I love you so mucho
