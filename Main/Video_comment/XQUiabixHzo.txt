a $10 hotdog is crazy work.
You made more than minimum wage
In total he made $20.60
This is the absolute most chaotic Ryan trahan video out there. But it’s also one of the best 😂😂😂
$10 for a hot dog?
The northindian shopkeeper is literal garbage...
Social anxiety fears this man
The one I know if from is ridin spinners
Ryan I love your videos but when you were running that cameraman made my brain go 🌪🌪🌪
I think Ryan would be a good money advisor cause he’s making. He’s really good at making money from one penny 👍
Just love this guy
Anyone here in 2025
all I’m saying is that it ain’t minimum wage
“Howdy”       -Ryan Trahan

Scared money don't make money- if you are too afraid to make money off of an investment and you pull your money out before you make a profit that is what scared money is.

dude could of just kept selling water and would have made heaps more money.
take a shot everytime ryan does the awkward chuckle and you will die
3:35 I actually understood the language they were from India and they were saying Hindi
Howdy! Howdy! Howdy!
I have been a huge fan of youtube for over 10 years and this is the only time a video has shown up over and over and over and over and over again in my suggested videos. God wanted me to watch this Ryan.
WHY IM I NOT SUBSCRIBED TO HIM YET?
this video missing a howdy count🤣🤣
Bro said howdy 84 times
I have a good idea so what you do is you get as much money as you can in two hours and then you have tomlast a week with all the money you’ve collected
His little, “ we’re doing really good on time right now hehehe
I still don't get what the challenge is. You have 1 hour to turn a penny into a hotdog?
H😊
Why does Ryan sound like sonic from the sonic the hedgehog movies
howdy - ryan
For an hour, that's not awful
The funniest part about this is that if it was similar to traditional speedruns this would be his 5000th attempt (If he was lucky)
ryan's videos are like a mini movie
Those people are proud Indians the people that gave you the water bottles
Those
Work place drama 😂 sound like she was about to get fired 😂
if you do this for 7 hours every day for a month, you'd gain 4323.9 dollars. which is is good considering the average american male gets paid around 3000 dollars per month
That discount store man is speaking Hindi
that was me at 10:45 😂 we actually framed that drawing and it’s still on our wall till today. it was good meeting you brother, keep up the good work. God bless.

I honestly dont know how ryan pulls these things off, its crazy
HOWDY 😂
Aww you should have let Katie draw that last one.  14:57
I feel like the 60-second caricatures are better than his regular caricatures.  Maybe he works well under pressure.  Edit: well, the first and third anyway.  😂
I love you bro:)
15:21 I really like this transition!
I greatly appreciate your penny challenge, as it provides a valuable opportunity for many individuals to learn a method of earning money from you.
15:09 you can see the Minnie that pulled me and my boyfriend aside, forced us to take a picture with them and then forced us to pay them 20 bucks. Ahhhh New York City.
In your short you said you got 900 dollars
“Howdy”😂😂
He makes it look so easy..

Asking where the subway is in NYC takes on a whole different level of difficulty
I mean, when you think about it it’s a 2060x profit
I just realised that ge spent more then he raised
You guys have a good day     …ok
I have a feeling that whenever Ryan’s low on money he does this lol
By the way, he made 20.60$

The Hindi words from the Dollar Store awakened us
His laughs 💀💀💀

Bro said howdy so many times
How knows Hindi and can understand workplace drama
Bro has social skills maxed out

We can all agree Ryan is a person we can all relate to
For those who don’t want to watch the full video he made $20.60

Motion sickness
This inspires me to do this but I live in a little town where it would take me 7 minutes to find someone
For those that don't wanna watch and find out, he made 20.60 $
I proclaim Ryan as a certified hustler
They should make a TAS out of this, would totally watch it
Not sure if New York has a bottle deposit, but if they do trahan is just like me and forgets about the deposits for buying bottles of water 😂
Bro has no social anxity😂😂😂😂😂😂
He ended up with about 20 bucks and bought a glizzy
Ryan when he has to 6 minutes left and only 5 dollars:
crazy how the vid was made in 2022 and  this short was made in 2024
He proved that you can make money anywhere you just gotta try and have confidence. Keep up the good work. ❤
Penny changed 2024
Shouldn’t have gotten the bike when you could’ve asked Spider-Man for a lift
“Howdy!” “Hehgheh”
2:39 his little laugh is so cute😭💗 and then when he says he’s having so much fun he sounded like a little kid he’s my comfort YouTuber
hey ryan renolds
So I live in NYC you could’ve taken a peddle assist one which you didn’t need to pedal so much could’ve saved you also a lot of time but now you know for next time
13:27 SPIDERMAN
Anyone who wants to know he made “$20.60” 🗿
He made 20.60 dollars for anyone wondering  Thank me by liking
You’re my favorite YouTuber just because you did this in New York
Bro social anxiety has Ryan anxiety 😂
Here after Ryan uploaded a Short. 👇🏻
Ryan you should start from a penny to travel across the world
You can tell he’s not used to nyc cause he says hi to everyone he passes lol 😂
timTom is right
His awkward nice guy thing is an act. Still like him tho, but you know it’s a act lmao.
3:34 the man is speaking Hindi😂
Dude, And I thought I had the most hectic life on earth. You just made me feel half better! LOL LOL...watching you while I eat my 1 minute dinner. At this rate I should have your video finished in about 2 weeks.

So that is how he teased the travel across the world “kinda”
2:39 I must’ve played this 8 times or so already 😭😭😭😭 the laugh is great
Do it without the camera u dumpfk
2:56 people traffic😂😂😂
Bro just made 2000x his starting money in an hour
2:38
I mean minimum wage is 12$ so 20$ is good but 7 attempts tho
Cute little twink like him should open a kissing booth. He could make good money from me
Does anyone know if the girl at the dollar shop was fired for over charging customers? Highly unethical conduct from him.
Ok
the person on 3:44 was a indian because he was spiking hindi
2:38  the camera man: 😭  IDK HOW CAMERA MEN STAY SO SILENT BRUV
Dare you to do the penny challenge in another country
3:52  that duude was scolding him for charging him more he said   Tumne kese. 75 cents lagadiye..which meant  How did you charge 75 cents
Katie: I wanna try caricature Ryan: ok hold my poster 😂😂😂
Ryan walking by anybody.. : Howdy! 🤠
As an anime artist u thought he's got good structure then I saw the end of the caricature
Hindi people lets goo Indian/pakistani in store
I love the word "Howdy." I think it's awesome
mh He hE hE
He is so patient
He was speaking Hindi and he was saying to the girl "Are you crazy"
His laugh at 2:38 is golden
you guys agree that all Ryan's videos outro is like movies
10 BUCKS FOR A HOTDOG???????????
2:50 Years ago, people would blame men for manspreading and I have never seen videos shaming girls like those who would take a whole sidewalk even though they are only 2. 😅
3:36 XD the shop owner is calling her stupid in Hindi lmao
the lady says she wants to do the caricature and you hand her the sign oh my gosh.
I love how he says howdy to like every person he sees, then they ignore him
What is the song at the beginning of the video???
Loving these types of videos! Keep up the amazing work, Ryan!
The guy in the  store said are you a crazy person to the girl  in hindi
Indian guy with the math let's gi
20 bucks in a hour is not bad
10$ for a hot dog is insane i would never pay that price
Bro 10$ a glizy😮
I'm believeing that with a cameraman everything gets better.
man made a new job
at 14:56 the time went slowly but the countdown went faster
Bro’s so good at drawing
Brett & Eddy if u know u know
How is no one talking about Brett/Dylan not donating?!
Imagine someone bring 50K to him and...
We need one of these again this year 😂
Did anyone else notice the Person dressed up as the Statue of Liberty in the background when Ryan sits down and enjoys his hotdog?
Indian shopkeeper in new York not expected 😂
That Indian store ❤
love the spiderman in the background at 13:27
10 dollars for a hotdog??
The store is run by Indians and he was actually shouting at her in Hindi
It’s over for the I forgot time
2:39 with that hehehe
That money in one hour would be 4.8k in a month which is not bad at all...
And now he's going there in his new series
3:50 Indian guys
the fact that he did the pacifist run where he's super nice to everyone even tho he's in a hurry he doesn't rush anyone else
9:04 omg I’d literally cry
Preston running behind Ryan rethinking his life choices
The Indian shopkeepers drama 😂😂😂
howdy baby
Shoutout to the cameraman for keeping the shot on him despite BOTH of them running
Pagal ho kya that store owner W
Character
If anyone wondering what bose say he say that you mad or what
Bro you should have turned the earth into a penny at the end
12:27
This soo cool
Idk why I was eating and too speedrun that
Love the familiar "Howdy"s
If that was workplaces drama then you should do a 12 challenge with a job
Only Indians will understand what they were talking about at the store
The here we go again video works perfectly for the ending 😭😭
It’s sad that was his best attempt
ryan's left leg is always giving the best life advice 24/7         If you know, you're a true fan
👌speedrun
It's nice to watch a content like this <3
i mean i think the water works best
i cant wait for july 1
$10 for a hotdog O_o
Shesssshhh
Ryan is so nice I wish he was my friend also props to the cameraperson for running while holding that big camera
How many howdy's do you say bro
I watched this at 2x speed, so I speedran a speedrun
Ryan met with thé creator of youtube and he doesent know  À.k.a jared
That shop keeper is Indian..
This cameraman needs a raise
No one talking about 13:28
Only 40 minutes away is New York to me 0:23
W for Ryan and for the cameraman
was tat same girl Vanessa who got the house
Indians are everywhere 😅😅😅
He’s so awkward and I like that
Ryan is the most awkward/ funny/ cute person ever😂
lol
In Italy pleaseeeeeeeee
It’s kinda crazy that he 2000x his money in one hour. Even if he only made 20 cents
The fact he says howdy to everyone he passes he’s so nice
Shopkeeper is Indian😂
Ryan is uncomfortably sociable, not socially uncomfortable, as I have seen.
now where’s the no clip glitch that has to be preformed in a single frame  to save 2 seconds
"hoWdY"
It was a great experience
Bad
And here I am making 16/hr at work 😂
so you get 4 times my monthly salary on venezuela in an hour... cool
Ryan the 5th ave discount stores manager lives in my country i.e India
Ryan. dude 7 tries 8 if counting the actual one.
You missed a Buck from that guy he gave u 5
As i watched this i felt you're embarrassment and my social anxiety rose
Next: foreign country penny challenge
If he made 20.60 in 1 hour and lets say he did the same in that mrbeast penny challenge for 10 hours a day that is 206 dollars a day times that by 30 because it was for 30 days that leaves us with 6,180 dollars he wud have earned if he did the same in that penny challenge
Bro U Did A Great Job For This Video!
Bro says “Howdy” to everyone 😂
Glad to know you’re still not eating vegetables.
All the maniacal laughing had me dying
I'm genuinely impressed with Ryan's artistic skills along with his ability to be entertaining at the same time.
No one is talking about the Indian guy store and his daughter calculating wrong and entering wrong amount not taking discount into consideration, You made 20 dollars in 1 hour and other people in jobs are making 14 dollars an hour the only difference is their money is fixed while yours isn't
Dude that outro was fkin insane.
Do you work for Uber eats?
I think you could make more mone by food delivery
How many times ryan Said howdy
EasySpeezy would be proud
Howdyyyyyy I love that word
awh i didnt know people can be that nice sometimes, i should socialize more
howmany times did u say howdy-
0:03 whats the song name?
Guys we caught an Indian in the shop where ryan buy water he said "pagal ho Tum" means "you are stupid"
SPIDER MAN IN THE BACKGROUND
the hindi speaking storeowner you bought water from was funny
Aint no way that hot dog cost $10
He got the best seed
“Right here dude”  I love how Ryan instantly defused that interaction
I'm sorry did he just pay 10 dollars for the shittiest fucking hot dog in new york?
i feel sorry for the camera man/woman, honestly.
Hands up of Ryan is the goat✋
Imagine a youtuber with 12M subs delivering food to u 😮
Bro you can’t do this because tommy is gone lets go tommy😊
suggestion: You should do this sppedrun outside of usa
Is anybody gonna talk about the thumbnail💀
I sec there is an Indian in new York in the seen 3:35  the manager is speaking Hindi the Indian language 😮 and I Indian too so I will tell you what did the manager said in Hindi so he said       Pagal ho gayi ho kya mean "have you got mad" Like if its helpful Love from India 😊
Howdy
does he have a condition the sound he makes when he laughs
Video idea: penny challenge going around the world
3:35 The man was talking in Hindi the language of India
I come from a small town in the UK. I recently went to NY and while it was amazing let's just say Ryan wasn't joking with Times Square being overstimulating. As an autistic person as well it was like x10 for me. Ryan I admire that fact that you had the guts to stand in and run around times square for an hour lol
dogecoin
You should try doing this challenge in a different country like Canada
Wow
that guy at the store was speaking hindi an indian language
10$ for a piece of bread and a weiner?
The guy in the background at the end dressed as the statue of liberty made me crack up
Dudes working for 20 dollars an hour that's fricken awesome 👌
I made more than 50 dollars today from nothing
11:15 those boys are fine
new york looks horrible (for and autistic person)
Bro is in New York but at the end came out of South America
Every body say thanks to the girl to make this video work🎉🎉🎉🎉
7:49 hold up I have that sketch pad 🤔
at least he didn't say sue me
the guy on 3 39 is a indian
In every video you say howdy at least 17 times😂😂
"howdy hehe"
Those workplace people from where Ryan bought water bottles were Indian
*characters
20 dollars x 8 hours= 160 dollars a day 160 x 30= 4800 dollars a month That's not bad!
yba trades be like
Fun fact:where i live water costs 50 cents so 2$ for 3 doesn’t seem like a good deal to me
so its begging with a camera ? that's so sad to even make content of
He said that’s the most workplace drama? they’re Indian bro.
I didn't expect to see Airrack in this video..
The shopkeeper is Indian
3:33 OMG!! that's HINDI there are INDIAN!!!people in NEW YORKKKKK!!!
How did he get to NY💀💀💀 that cost like 100s if not 1000s
good job
I understand the language in that they arguing
15:22 New york is now in Panama I guess...
This is really entertaning 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
If I did this I would be embarrassed as HECK! lol😂
Preston the popular youtuber is recording??
9:59 you say that as I'm biting mine ☠️
3:35 even though I'm not Indian, I understood what they were saying and it wasn't good ☠️

This man Ryan is so wholesome.  Love everytime he says "Howdy".  As a Brit i love this and how he interacts with people.  This whole video made me smile.
0:55 im a super fan and i noticed that 6 the musicals sign
I saw my self 2 times and my mom 4 times ...
Ryan got so good rng there at the start
When did you get a penny that's not even a thing anymore
He is not a person who has funny acting it's his acting is funny😂
I love how Ryan is just lie, dww it’s fine when someone denies him
IS HOWDY YUR NEW FAV WORD ?!!?!?!
This guy has convinced me to fail my exams and try these social hacks to earn money 😢
Dream be like: …
Your sound is similar to rekrap
That's why mrbeast said Ryan will be the next YouTuber to hit 100 million subs
Thank you for acting as a source of inspiration for me Ryan, Raza :)
why do i think all of these people are the same, u guys are like "AYYOOO BRO JUST *insert here*" am I right XD
I just heard the discount store people speaking Hindi
Hi
The social skills of this guy are insane
Ryan’s video are so entertaining!
Anyone notice Spider-Man in minute 13:27?
Apple video stabilisation be like.
as an indian, it was very funny to see store employees calling each other idiots while ryan just stands there waiting for water AND IM A NEW 'ORKER
i think everyone thought he was on something tbh lmao
bro invented challenge and speedran it
Y'all notice how he made more than 20 bucks in a hour?
3:36 indian man he indian

The fact that I accidentally skipped 10 seconds and got “I- am cute”😂
THAT STORE IS INDIAN

Ryan after running:*GASPING FOR AIR* The cameraman after running with the same speed while holding a camera:🗿. 😂😂
Where he is is where I had my birthday

Lol Entertainment is great haha but if you really want more  mow a yard I can make 50+  a hour on a good day doing that lol but GOD Bless.
your one new york hotdog was like half of my weekly allowance 😂😵 (including my 3 meals per day)
This was super fun to watch! It's crazy how you turned a penny into $20. Also, that last customer was an awkward interaction, and now I want to die.  ...but thanks for the video!
3:35 are they Indians... I think so... 8:26 again I am damn sure they are Indians...
who else love when he says howdy
He got the perfect seed 💀
Someone has to make this a legitimate speed run catagory
2:36 mKaaaayyy-
Just make him the GOD OF PENNIES
Social anxiety is afraid of him
I hope he took a 4 hour shower after laying on the sidewalk like that. Yikes
i live in new york city. it,s easy to manage there.
2:37 goofy ahh laugh
the NRG is insane ngl
This guy can be so cool and so weird at the same time 😂😂😂
I don’t know how but I got unsubscribed so I subscribed again!🎉🎉

We need a counter for the amount time he said howdy
You’re big brain
True
U should do this with pringles😂
Respect for the camera man keeping up!
When i think of YT, i think of Ryan. He is the PEAK of YT creators. H E , is the DEFINITION, O F, YOUTUBER. He is THE Youtuber.
3:34 I heard that man saying "phagal " which means idiot or smth in hindi 🤣
Watching this video was basically Anxiety+ LMAO
He found a infinite money glitch again
I LOVE THE VIDEOS. I LOVE THE HONESTY. For example, when you say this wasn't your first attempt at this challenge. And that doesn't make it less cool. No, it makes it sometimes even funnier, shows your dedication and makes everything more trustworthy and thus, even cooler. 😁💖
Did I hear the vendor saying_arey pagal ho kya
It so funny how he says hi howdy so many times 😭😭
Ryan is the new dream
But have you paid sales tax though?
like my comment then  tell me your fav meme
Me: how to make money.... Ryan, your nexT! Ryan Trahan: pen 4 penny water for 2 dollar soda 4 2 dollar

W cameraman
You know I have a idea you should do a penny challenge for 3 months you have to go to 30 country's
Richard is my hero
Let’s go tommy
He looks so weird without a beard
what is meant by "howdy"
Bruh as a Indian I loved the workplace drama part bro
Why is no one talking bout that Indian man's accent The comment section is too decent 💀💀💀
3:25 Respect for that INDIAN DUDE for the honesty!
YOU SHOULD TRY THIS WITH A DIFFERENT MAP
ryan is akward but dramatic
This guy is insane, In hail Our 1 cent Speedrunner
Bro imagine if he reversed this challenge. Like he starts with 100 and he sees how fast he can get to a penny. But he can only go down 10 dollars at a time
Go to the Saharan desert and sell water you’ll get a lot of money then 😂
somebody please drop nicoles @
Today ITS my birthday
What about you do 30 Day
Ryan is the best
i think that a quicker way to complete this speedrun is to steal someones wallet
One penny challenge WW Any% because hes the only attempt
That 2.6 billion in circulation is really triple that with all the non reported drug sales
Howdy king
context of the video: howdy 🤠
Ryan you've lowkey gotten better at those caricatures!
Ryan must make a game about turning a penny into a 1 million dollars.
9:35 why’s that dude lookin at his ass like that 😂😂
Casey Trahan
how did you survive without a ice coffee
15:31 Indian uncle in hindi: "PAGAL HO KYA?"  Don't worry ur indian friend will translate that for you: "Are mad or what?"

I love it when a person argues with another person 3:38
he literally made more than minimum wage starting from a PENNY
we need to count how many times he says “howdy” in this one video
Your awkward “howdys” are killing me😭😭
3:49 bruhh the owner is an Indian 🇮🇳 ❣️🙌🏻
10:27 SPIDER-MAN IS IN THE BACKROUND???
Ryan isn't socially awkward. he is awkwardly social.
howdy
Did Dylan pay?
At the end why did it zoom out on south america. Bro was in the north. Great speedrun though keep up the good work!
15:21 it looked like he was about to be mugged😂
Buys pen for 0.01, Sells pen for 1.00,   bets on rock paper scissors, buys water, Sells water, rents bike & uber eats, then does art commissions, buys hotdog
If you want to read the Gospel then I will put something like that in my replies, but if you read that then you should still read the complete Gospel. I put this because in Acts 1:8 it says “You will be my witnesses in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the end of the earth” so I put this to do what The Lord says. If you read it then like the comment so that more people can see it and more people have at least one opportunity because accepting Jesus Christ as our Lord and Savior is the most important decision that you will ever make.
Howdy Ryan
Howdy
Can you do Florida please ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤love your video 😂 lol
The great reset
❤ Genius
The dedication ❤
Taxes clutched it here
🍎
We’re doing well on time heheheh
wow, can anyone just casually take uber orders like that? I didn't know! :0
That shop owner is Indian
I like how it the end it zooms out of South America, so technically South America is where New York is located.
Drinking game:  Take a shot every time Ryan says “howdy”   Don’t actually do this, you will die lmao
your camera man is so good he doesnt even breathe
15:05 I AM HER AND SHE IS ME !!!😂
Loved Ryan’s “random” countdown at the end and then one of them asking what was that for? Ryan says, “I don’t know” And moves on. 🙂
At 2:02 my guy looks like ronaldo
Ryan Trahan in 2050: I crossed the universe with $0.01

OMG THE WATER SELLER SAID CRAZY TO YOU IN INDIAN
He is so Texan it’s funny, every five seconds:  ”howdy “🤠
wow 10$ for a hotdog 💀😭
This is pretty inspiring. I might try this. Honestly it’s amazing that in just an hour you can make 20$ from basically nothing. Just gotta step out of your comfort zone and be ready for anything. Much love
Ah yes, Ryan Trahan. The YouTuber where all their celebrities seem like they’re 30 minutes long but are actually only 10-20 minutes long
Camera  😂😂😂😂man

New York was just a lucky seed
Wow Indians at shop of water bottles

2:48  I love how respectful Ryan is, he walks at a normal speed behind the girls because they might think he is a creep and he is chasing them.
8:39 - 8:47 You guys have to see the indian girl in that store she literally not doing anything😂😂😂😂

It’s the fact that it’s New York so most people won’t say howdy back😂😂😂
lol love the vids
3:36 the manger looking guy said to the girl in hindi that she is dumb 😂
He also did not walk in Phoenix Arizona
Did anyone noticed the shopkeeper was  speaking Hindi language 🇮🇳🇮🇳
Starting the man who gave 5 cents back was actually indian and spoke hindi too with the girl
That did not zoom out from New York
Did you see the  destroy all humans poster
3:35...Ae pagal ho kya tum...😆
I wanna try one of these challenges someday & get out of my comfort zone it looks fun

This vidio has 6.9 million views right now 🤓
Pineapple 🍍

In there language I thing they are speaking Urdu but the man said are you crazy or you have gotten crazy
Dylan got a cool caricature dho👌💯😊🇺🇬
W Ryan
Did anyone notice that glizzy was 10 bucks
Lol I heard him saying are Tum pagal ho kya Which means are u stupid
Creative idea with the challenge. You could seriously turn this into a series or you visit every city and do something like this.
Howdy
The captions of the noises Ryan makes when excited or running are incredible.
👨‍❤️‍💋‍👨
👁👄👁
Hello my name is also Dylan and I think your cool 👍
I live. in nye
3:35 Lol they are indians speaking in hindi, I can understand
My guy hit the sprint button 2:52

15:32 ending
Helloy ray me brasil traduz
Ryan escaped the matrix
“What?! What did we win what we doin now?”  Ryan: oh idk that was all I had planned I’m gettin a glizzy
Love how those guys were like “AW WHAT you were like the new homie we were gonna all chill”
The shopkeeper was Indian
Is that they are iPhone 14 Pro Max with a fish background because that’s like the exact same as my phone
I wouldn’t be suprized if one day I see Ryan make 100 bucks with nothing but a rock he found
Have to have respect for the camera man running around recording this
GOD BLESS!!! 🙏❤️
W
This man would never be out of money.
Can we talk about how he spends 1.99 on pens when he got one for a penny
props to the camera man for following him
Mh-HEHEHEHE
Bro made more than minimum wage in a hour from a penny
Someone count how many times he says "howdy" lol.

Bro's challenging Tommyinnit
You guys need a gimbal lol
sheeesh cool video

That penny challenge was such an epic journey and will always be remembered. I just remember every day looking forward to watching Ryan. It was so fun and I kinda miss it. But Ryan is such an awesome legend. Judging by this video I know he will do this kind of thing for many many years to come to help planet earth and the people on it. Ily Ryan!!!❤️❤️❤️🥺😭😂❤️❤️
i legitimately wanna be friends with ryan he's such a nice guy.
10 DOLLARS FOR A HOTDOG?
Etr
he was given donations by those people. he didn't convert that penny into shit
“There’s nothing like taking some time to slow down in all the hustle and bustle.” This was part of why I was here. Thank you God 🙏  :)
Guys ryan road to 15.000.000 subscriber
At 3:40 pai Indian aaya jo ooho
The owner of the dollar store is Indian and he is speaking hindi
A penny will get you a toss in a fountain in New York City!!! A bottle of water 10 bucks, lamb over rice 15 bucks, hot dog 11 bucks. You can’t even spend a night in New York for 150 dollars. Good thing your in Times Square doing this challenge other parts of New York yeah you’d be a target for trafficking my friend. By the way you are at the wrong part of New York City
My birthday is October 7th 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉  best day ever
Can anyone tell me the intro song name?
That Indian guy 😮😂
He said howdey to literally everyone on earth
make sure to sell the bottle of water at a airport
Im challnge you to doi't in algreia

He's not emberest around pepole
Ryan looks like an npc when running
hold up you guys pay $10.50 for a hot dog on NY?
not airack just chilling in the first clips🔥
As someone ACTUALLY named Dylan, I apologize for that imposter Dylan's actions. True Dylans would've paid you for your time and....expertise.
From the shop he buyed water bottle ,he was Indian and he said tu pagal hai kya it means are you mad
If your content ever gets stale or less views doing this with hidden cameras as a social experiment to show how less people are willing to help off camera would be awesome
Jesus loves yall
I like how those women blocked his way, and he starts slowing down... that something that actually happens a lot😂😂😂🤣🤣
Yo Ryan, I challenge you to do this speed run in Mexico!
The sequel we needed
You're literally liam Thompson with a different voice and face
I love how in the description it said "60 Minutes. 1 penny. 0 social skills"
He was a Indian
Don’t you guys remember the girl that had the hijab she is a Muslim 🧕 🧕🧕🧕
Oh. The sweet California bow running around New York City asking “where’s the subway?” Referring to the restaurant not the transportation - not realizing everyone in this damn city hears that question 3,000 times a day.
Ryan or Airack are gonna be the next person with 100 million subs.
Hey Ryan can I do the penny challenge or is it like trademarked or something
3:37 hahhahahahahahahahah
10:47
Okay... I've seen this video a few times and I just noticed Airrack is literally in the intro of this video. I love how he is totally not mentioned though😆.
From where you buyed water the people where Indians
"Howdy" counter: 14
OK my question  is is that Seattle?
$20/hour is good lol
goofy
the shopkepper at 3:46 is an indian and he literally said are you crazy
What was that green man doing at the end?
Awks

water bottle seller was from my country India 🇮🇳
Imagine having to pay tax… wait no not like that!
The store guy was Indian 🇮🇳  (˵ ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°˵)
Not to be rude but technically you did the penny challenge wrong because you use your phone for DoorDash and walking dogs you need to buy your phone so technically you did not start with a penny thank you for doing the challenge those

With the waters, he probably didn't consider the bottle deposit. Yay NY!
The indian dad with the girl had me dying.
bro Ryan it would be cool if you did a 5 person penny challenge

Tip: keep buying water bottles with the money you make from selling them
Your laughter is freaking stupid and annoying I'm dead

He earned denmarks mimal wage
This gives me anxiety lol

still made more money than i do at work in an hour so
I would try this but I don’t have any coins
when ryan had to stop sprinting behind the two girls trying not to scare them 😭
im cringeing
👏
Easy it is called get a job😂😂
Ryan is just being a psychopath the whole time. New York life! I love New York. No I legitimately love New York 😠
No one noticed that Statue of Liberty guy
When you say that no one likes you I don’t think that’s true you have a lot of friends and you proved it all so many people are subscribed to you and that means they like you.
Did seriously spend 10 dollars on a fucking hot dog
Such a fun video! Good stuff
H-how-hawody
He done it again
You where where I live.. NOOOOOOOO
Pov Ryan to everyone: howdy
13:28 bro the spiderman in the background💀
Such a cliffhanger not being able to see Katie's caricature.
I'm the only guy who understand what shaop keeper told her employee because I'm indian and that guy spoke Hindi 😂
no way he does a penny across the world right?
Bro...come on ,use some new ideas ...you use the same idea again and again..it makes ur videos boring
3:55 he's definitely Indian and a true बनिया 😎
Bro made more .money than minimum wage
Why do you say speedran not speedrun
That Dylan guy he drew is such a loser
Pachppchpch
Those store guys were talking in 🇮🇳 hindi
13:28 anyone see spiderman or is it just me
Bruh them indians were fighting 🤣😅
I hear howdy 100x time😂
"My name is brett but i go by dylan for fun" that just made my night
the guy in the water bottle store said “tum pagan hi kya” which means are you mad in hindi😂😂
How the sponsor of the video does not count towards the challenge is beyond me
How long was he in time square?
3:38 I saw a Indian saying pagal that means mad
3:36 translation: are stupid huh?
that count down at the end though🤣
I don't know if anybody else noticed, but I think that at the end with the earth ending Ryan is hinting at a 0.01 challenge across the world
omg is it seriously $10 for a hot dog?
Try doing this in Seattle WA
Glizzy
I grew up in New york
Rip camera man 😂🎃 happy Halloween
He should sign the caricatures because he’s popular and maybe people will sell them or frame them I know I would buy it
I’m exhausted after watching this 😂😂😂
Isaac de snuts
"Howdy"
New Yorks pretty awesome I miss it
does discount store owner said "pagal ho tum" typical indian🤣🤣🤣🤣
HOWDY
The 99 cent store
I think you should do this challenge in russia since its very small
Howdy meaning??
I love that every 5 seconds he laughs
Next thing you know this mf explores space and universes 💀
Cross the intire world on one penny
the shop guy be like “are tum to pagal ho bilkul
Yes ❤
oh my god im stuipid ued never reply or like me
Lol,The shopkeeper was Indian, he was talking in hindi I can understand him
The first water store owner were indians
Ryan is now officialy the best speedrunner in the world
If Ryan just does these penny challenges (Short ones) like twice or thrice a day. He can earn upto like 80 dollars a day. Thats 28800 dollars per year. Which is alot. He can speed up this proccess by doing this penny thing more times in a day. He can make a living
the store manger was indian when he say pagal ho tum (3:35)
Thats pretty sad that no celebs came but then there is your really true friends who never forgets you. Happy birthday Ryan! fire emoji🔥
15:19 the entire time I was like 'that looks like sensory overload of it was a place' so I'm glad you said something XD
the shopkeeper is a Indian
bro did villager trading irl
Bruh I could under stand what that maneger was saying let’s say it not nice
should have offered to work at mcdonalds for 60 minutes, could easily make 20+ in tips
next ryan trahan video: TRAVELING ACROSS THE WORLD WITH ONLY ONE PENNY!
W last girl I’m from San Antonio too
tbh his 60 sec drawing is better than my 60 day drawing
3:45 Woo Indian store owners! Always displaying integrity>:D
Wait $10 for one Hot Dog!? Dang New York is stealing money
the jaw line on the picture 14:39
It’s always nice to see Ryan be happy during a video
Ngl you should have gave the People the 20 bucks at the end (the People that were Holding you sign)
I’m pretty much s celebrity, I have 0 subscribers🔥
Good job Ryan
0:20  It’s Airrack
u met a wild INDIAN
Next thing you know it he will be doing a get across the world with one penny in 3 months LMAO
The moral for today you can get 2 hot dog sliders in 1 hour from a penny
Fun Fact:The cameraman had to speedrun with him too,He didnt get a bicycle too
happy birthday
RYAN'S PENNY IS A GREAT PROFIT
Awesome video
So we're not gunna talk about how insanely good looking the guy at 11:26 is???

The workplace drama people were either indian or pakistani
I JUST SHAT A GIANT SPIDER🔥🔥🔥
Yoooooo oOoOO oOoOO
3:36 lol Indian guy
The cashiers was her dad he was scolding her in hindi
Very nice
It would be a good idea if you do a penny challenge but you use marketing tactics to sell stuff
3:23 she was trying to give you a free one lmaooo

Big fan

Let's all just appreciate how much effort Ryan puts into his videos. mf even took a drone shot of the whole earth just for the outro

In 8:33 did the girl get fired
Ryan -“This is the craziest night of my life”  Ryan -does arts and crafts*

That’s a life message from Ryan guys anyone with the determination and heart can make money and put smiles on faces !!!
Sorry Ryan I forgot to say congrats 🎉 on 10 mil😊
You should do one on England but in 7 days since its small and deliver 2 penny's some random on the beach but you start with 2 penys and each sub in the week is 2 penny's to cancer treatment, you have to get on trains and stuff
I feel like I should tell you this because you probably can relate but I lost my grandpa right after my birthday and I had never met my grandpa because he died before I was even born but I wondered what advice you could give on ways of o remember him
Let’s just have a sequel to biggie/thanos great day out
If you go to the time 13:28 in the video if you look Behind Ryan you can see spider man
Ryan can y'all do another season of odd one out please
You ended up at a Indian discount store woww
level of honesty "I am being dramatic for no reason!"

Alexa, remind me to bring a pen when I go to America
$10 for a glizzy? I live in britan and its £1.50 so damn😊

The store drama was in Hindi, I am Indian and I understand what they were saying,, shopkeeper was angry on that girl🤣🤣🤣

br u h momen
Who orders Subway in NYC? Like going to Sbarsos for pizza.
Man this reminds me of the time I visited New York City. I was coughing the whole time, constantly winded. In fact I got so sick, it was the most sick I've ever been in my entire life. Couldn't drink water or eat for 4 days straight.
gujarati bc kabhi toh paise chodd do!!
Some Pennie’s are rare like a 1940 or below penny can be worth a lot
it didn’t zoom out of new york at the end lol
no way that was an hour. but nice video
people who grew up in nyc seeing him lay on the floor: 😨..
"pen girls" LOL ASVFASDA
New York hot dog is 10 bucks???
This video really gives off nice vibes. Ryan himself too.
GiZy
W nicole
You should teach me one or two of these methods. 👍
I was sad when the 30 day challenge ended cause that was apart of my morning routine
You should travel across the Europe with 0.01€
The lava monkeys are in the dessert land
Where are the lava monkeys?
Someone please do a Ryan “howdy” count 😂
The caricature was my favorite in the 30 day penny challenge
This just proves that anyone can make money they just gotta try
Wait, how much for that hot dog?
Jared from the first YouTube video? 2:28
bro bought all his stuff from an indian shop, thats rarely seen in new york
RYAN WAS HERE IN MY CITY & I DIDN'T KNOW?!?!? 😱😱😱😭🤧😭😭
2:39 what the hell was that laugh and how come the captions aren't funny about it 🤣🤣
That's amazing bro. Imagine if you travel across  the EU with a penny lol.
Ryan I saw you at the gas station. I think
$20.60 in an hour is $5 above NYC minimum wage
ong
fact:the shopkeeper was indian
Idea travel to country only with dollar
3:35 the man said are you dumb
2:39 "I am doing very well on time rn HeNHehhEhJeHeHeHeGeHreHHhHeEG"
This is so epic bro, keep it up!
When he walked inside my apartment building

why does he honk every time he laughs it was so noticeable to me lol
Niceee👍👍👍
Why he gotta do us like dat in the ending
Try in ohio
this video is by the far the best ive ever seen
Bro do the ganzfield experiment with red light 🤣   If u do this I'll cut my toes off
Don’t do the laugh thingy it’s so annoying
i'm indian and understandig their arugment over the bottle price is just hilarious 'tum pagal ho kya?' translated to english are you mad or what is just✨✨
"Tum paagal ho"
3:36 speaking Hindi
💀the water guy called her pagal
ASAP :- as soon as possible 😎
I think he is going to do a Speedrun across the world next time
Your videos make my day all the time ❤
YES THEY ARE INDIAN
that dolloar store guy is scolding her and calling her mad
🇻🇳 many people will think this is china
10 dollars a hot dog!? Are you mad, thats so much
The shop owner said "abbey kya pagal ho kya tum" It means "hey are you crazy or wot" 💀
Am I the only one who was surprised when he said Preston?
making almost 40 bucks in an hour from a penny is not bad. obviously not counting expensive obviously not counting expenses
Do more of these
This man is a walking W
Hi. :D
My name is brett
Make a vid with ur DOG plz
I wouldn’t be able to do this at all
Ryan do be built different
I’m going to New York soon lol hope I see you :)
A street dog is $10? wut
"howdy"
howdy
That laugh when you were running at the start got me
Almost every single video I see of him he makes a new friend like the sherk fest the smallest house almost every 0.01 penny challenge submarine hotel
This man should be the biggest YouTuber on this platform
Is the ending where he shows the earth a foreshadow to something coming up?
Looking back at Ryan’s previous videos where he was contemplating life, to now…God has really carried you through brother
Man this is top quality content
lets give a like for the camera man
6:44😏
"you guys have a great day" "ok"
The owner of the discounted store was probably a Bihari, Ek bihari sab pe bhaari🤣🤣
Dude you should do the penny challenge and you have to get $500 in 1 day but the catch is you have to do it in a small town in Dallas called Trenton
Howdy howdy, this man is the ceo of Howdy
totally me trying to get the milk 2:49
When I looking at water bottle manager it looks typical Indian🤣
Shopkeeper was indian🇮🇳
You met my bf’s dad today!!!❤
Congrats on 10 mil <3!
This video is just art!
Ryan is the type of guy to attempt “not eat clam chowder in Massachusetts and try to survive the mad people” challange
You were the highlight of the summer; really loved the daily uploads❤❤❤❤
How exactly do you do this?
I SWEAR AT THE END THE GUYS BEHIND HIM WRER FINNA JUMP HIM 😂
15:30 this guy looks like Jeffrey Dahmer
The discount store guy is an indian and he is rude 😑 hella rude to his employees
That 2 $ water bottles thing , that guy was Indian, i heard the hindi there 😂
Me who lives in New York, IVE BEEN THERE
5:00
Penny Man
hello people, could you tell me more youtube channels with this type of content because I would like to learn from them, please .
I love how rayan just laughs the whole time and at the start how he explains why it is hard to run in nyc with all the traffic I love his goofiness in every video
have you noticed hes running fast but dosen`t take a brake😰
This person shows that we don't need a job
The fact Ryan not only speed ran this difficult challenge BUT also managed to fit in a sponsor speaks volumes to his talent as a YouTuber.
I subscribed and turned on the notification
Now do a speedrun on the poorest place
$
15:09 a glizzy in New York usually means a gun lmaoo
15:09 a glossy in New York usually means a gun lmaoo
when he went to buy some bottle and after sometime for marker that person who is the owner  of the shop was indian and i am too it look so good
stop milking
This man just speed ran new York
Howdy
‏‏‎‏‏‎
Am I the only one who picks up a little Neil Patrick Harris vibes from this guy? 🤔
Ryan you should do living on on cent acrossing the world
Bro really made Nicole dream
We went from making a shelter in the woods to the concrete jungle of nyc. I almost feel like this is on purpose.
3:37 Tum pagal ho tum lmao 😂
you should try 1  week penny without a phone but only for emergency purposes
shoulda paused the clock to get a pic wit those dudes
Pls travel the world with one penny that be sick
3:49 Indians
Before October ends, you will have an unexpected blessing…
Try cross the world with 1dollar
as an indian in the arguing workplaace the guy was calling the girl stupid for misculculating the price multiple times lmao
He acts kinda like a homeschooler lol
i love the fact that everyone ignored him when he said howdy xD
those people everywhere were like “this is normal” because in new york this is normal xD
The guy in water bottle store is speaking in hindi ❤️
He saying howdy like almost ever minute of this video.....
bruh 13:27 got spooder man in the back
Crazy rng
You should go to every US state and do this and see which state you make the most money in. whatever state u make the most money in wins and the state with the least money you have to live in with only 1 penny for a month
How many times has Ryan said howdy
Ryan why do you always say Preston is Preston your camera man?
What I have noticed with Ryan is he’s not socially awkward he’s awkwardly social 😂😂
the laugh tho at 2:39 mins is histarical
POV in Florida u can sell lemons in the street and water too meanwhile in New York u will be ran over
Ryan will be the next to 100 million subs
7:13 Forty*
imagine if you did this in a highschool or a college
need more vids more hahahahahahahahh
POV: The camera man just sprinting
Woooo!!! Go Katie lol
He got a really good seed
Ryan can u buy me a pick for my hair
Workplace drama is killing me 😂
the amount of “hehehslee” 😭
You can tell he’s from a small town because he says hi to everyone
I think that was airrack at the start
Bro I saw my granparents right next to you in time square but they don’t know who you are also I’m the kid that recognized you in Denver colorados airport before you did the yt short that you where scared of the electrical thingy
This is the first time a speed runner has a life because its not in a game
I've got a fun idea, try a random city speedrun you've never been, (and maybe even a city where they don't speak english)
Anyone else wanna see the other nine
ryan is actually really good at drawing
4:38 why did it say citi and not city
.
I can watch a whole video of Ryan doing 60 second caricatures  😂
Preston should get a GoPro because it has stabilising when Ryan runs
bro oinked when he laughed
3:18 there was Indian
bro why would you do this
The camera man is probably really buf
the shop guy was speaking hindi wtf
I’d love Ryan’s personality I feel like I connect so much off of a video. I too am a extroverted introvert (everything depends on who I’m talking to) and would love to have the people skills Ryan has. Keep up the killer work can’t wait to see what you do next!
WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO MAKE DR PHILL YOUR GRANDPA
Indian Guy running grocery store in nyc 😅
hotdog
i did not know a nyc hotdog was $10
Hotdog for 20 dollars? That is a failed society.
13:27  Ni**a wtf is that spidermaan???  (background)
Bro paid 10$ for a glizzy 💀
Man is playing mobile tycoon irl
Ryan is a caricature of himself. 😄
You should go back to the LCU family
Why is no one talking about that $10 glizzy. I don't remember them being that overpriced
I’m 11 and had a dream of meeting you
ok but it’s so funny watching him run around new york cause he’s just so socially awkward lol sorry ryan 🤭🤦‍♀️
3:36 anyone notices the guy speaks hindi?
Missed ur daily vids😢
3:40 that guy said u are mad or what in hindi
I love you ❤❤❤
Should of just kept selling water bottles.
Great video, I thoroughly enjoy this type on content
MAKE SURE YOU GIVE AFREE TESLA
0.69$, nice pricing right there
There is no way you can hate Ryan he is the best
3:35 POV: you are indian and know what they are saying
3:38 that guys is from india
Bruh the typo on info
he actually made more than $25k from this video and sponsorship
hello ryan i am from pakistan i am you biggest fan can i want a heart from you
You're going to try and deliver a penny to Pewdiepie in Japan, aren't you?
this man made $20 in 10 minutes... this is more than my hourly wage of $12, I think I'm quitting my job and moving to new york lol
I think I'm going to attempt this
3 30 at this time the shopkeeper was saying Hindi also sheeshhh😂
Indian People 3:36  love from india
well done for it so well
those actions scene reminds me about GoPro version of Daredevil
Bad luck this time, but we appreciate you, you never make us disappointed
He is back 💯💯
I actually can't believe I saw Ryan in the black car while he was driving the bike but I didn't want to say "Hi"
Howdy
Now we need to see this as a new category of speed run, I can see it blowing up in the future
Love the vid being born and raised my whole life BROOKLYN NYC ❗️personally I think it’s goona be hard in nyc lol
this was so much fun to watch! You go Ryan!
HE KNEW I WOULD CLICK

The water bottle store was an Indian crazy lol. He sayed the girl in hindi are you mad
Oh my god ur lungs r cryin...
0.69 tax nice
the store u bought water from them, they were indians lol
this made me very very happy
everyone may I introduce you to the most socially awkward person
Ain't no way !! Is that ma in the background?!?!
RYAN!!! Do a video where you see how many high fives 👍 you can get in 1hr
“If you don’t like it, slap me in the face. I’m just kidding, please” 🤣
2:48 Jesus Christ that was the exact place I was at
I was actually in New York 4 days ago in time square which happens to be were he is at.
3:36 that man is rude asf

Ryan I cant wait for the pizza
Ryan, you are incredible. I struggle with finding people funny, but once I watched your videos, I laughed! It was the best feeling. And now 10 years later, I’m laughing all of the time! Thank you so much Ryan, you are the best. - Nede
Man could've been hired somewhere for one hour and paid more
Love the boneworks music at the beginning
As a New Yorker… I’m surprised you didn’t get jumped in the process of this.
Ryan be my former brother
Why do you always say howdy😂🎉
This is really impressive and good Ryan. You are really funny😎😂
he just made more than minimum wage in california
every guy has experienced this while rurnning 2:51 , if you know you know
This is 26 on trending
Wonderful 🤩🤩
U IN NYC CITI BIKE ARE FREE
Next video-24 hours being anti social!
When you make more than the minimum wage just by selling stuff and drawing pictures of people
Ryan should try to survive in London England for a day starting at 10 pence
he wasted half of his time saying "howdy"
ok but can we ignore the background of the thumbnail  like the helicopter is really suspicious
When Ryan was doing the caricatures I saw a Spider-Man in the background
I watched that whole series everyday a new one was released. Please do a new series like that, it kept me going on my summer
I thought you are just scared of coins at this point
rip speed
U😢😢😢😢😢😢😢r😢🎉😢😮
he knows what he’s doing, others take some notes 😎
a great day ends with a glizzy
2:39 WHAT WAS THAT LAUGH
He’s so tramatized from the penny series he can’t stop doing it 😂
All the food delivery options aren't taxed so every dollar he makes he's actually going into debt at the same time to the government
if you film a youtube video in nyc go to jackson heights there is more traction and you can get more $ doing these challanges
that was awesome, you should do a penny challenge from one country to the US that speaks english because I think it would be impossible to do with a different language...
14:38 bro gave her the dream face reveal drawing 💀
Canada is trash
Gay canada has no 0.01
Manhattan 🌝 Bronx/Brooklyn 🌚
Next time could you try do it in the uk? I would appreciate it a lot!

Its funny how he makes them think he is professional with the talking and everything
Bro got the best seed
Didn't Ryan invent this challenge?
I went to NYC the day before he uploaded this so I think I missed out on something special 😂

A 10 dollar street hotdog????
Is Ryan going to do the Penny Challenge across the world?! Because at 15:32 he shows a picture of the globe so he might be foreshadowing… 👀
Ühildub nutitelefoniga ja võistkondlikult lõpu seisuga olid elanikest leedulasi

This isnt about the purchasing power of whats in hand. Youre basically asking people for stuff at this point
I could understand what the cashier at the discount store said in hindi. She said " U ARE CRAZY"

2:48 Me in the school hallways when I'm late for class...
Why is Ryan always unconventionally funny lol
bro I speak the doller store language he called her daughter silly
I grew up on Long Island and went to NYC a lot. Just watching you run around the places I know so we’ll makes me laugh. Also no hot dog will ever be better than NY style
Everyone in Huntsville is so nice I think you should do a speed run
how many time did he say howdy during this video
Well done on taking the challenge
What are you gonna do when pennies go extinct next year? You’re gonna have to start doing the nickel challenge
when he said sensory overload in newyork i felt that so much!!!!!
Yikes you got robbed for the price of that glizzy in Times Square ahaha
Dude! You know what’s crazy? I work at 1166 Avenue of Americas. You’re literally running around the building I go to work in almost every week! If I knew you were doing this, I would’ve found you and gave you $100!!
He's so cute with the "howdy" lol <3
I dont know why but you are really, genuinely, having fun
Do a part 2 of penny challenge in 2023

bro making above minimun wage for a youtube video
I live in Dallas like those 2 people
I mean he got 20 dollars an hour
At 3:36  The man said you’re dumb
I know how much you can make BECAUSE I LIVE IN NY
10$ for a hotdog seems pretty steep!
Literally thought he about to speed run across America😅
He should have gone back to the store and buy 9 bottles of water then sell them for 2 dollars each
Love you so much!! You're the only youtuber that makes me laugh like this. So thank you
I love the penny challenge
You haven't been to Pennsylvania
Bro has no ideas left so he just mixes the word 1 penny and some slurs
that cough🫣
I think the penny series hit so hard and good it overpowers any other idea he has so I think he jus gonna keep milking the 0.01 challenge pretty sad I loved the series but I can see the struggle sadly no hate like if u agree
y do u always say howdy
I feel like you could have made a couple hundred just selling waters in time square. Wouldn’t have made for as fun of a video tho. Lol. Love all the content man. Stay you!!
Vanessa tho😳
Too the shop keeper said are u crazy to that lady 😅😂😂
LETS GOOOO TOMMY
No one is talking about how Ryan has actually skills for drawing in 60 seconds now imagine if he takes his time, the best I can do is stick men
Bro is carrying YouTube right neow.
Ryan Iv always wanted to go to NY..Making  me jelly
1 cent one hour later 20$

Ryan Trahan lore
has anyone notice how much the man is rude to the girl in 5th ave because she gets things wrong haha
Your vid’s make my day
20 dollars an hour  not bad🥴😇
Can’t believe u spent 10 bucks on a hotdog
Low Budget Off Brand Dream for the $0.01 cent challenge.
Ryan Trahan, more like Ryan Tryhard
No, we lost him, he became a milker
I love how awkward u are😂😂😂😂😂
Dream face reveal?!?!?!
a glizzy for $10 is crazy to hear as a californian
Ryan's just clutch best youtuber out there
I did not laugh once this entire video
you are next to my hotel
While buying the bottles I saw an Indian dad shouting on his kid... somehow that made a good ROI of my time :P
you got scammed for that hotdog
When you know your from the same city as Ryan
I’m I the only one who cant stop thinking about how expensive that hot dog was at the end 😄
This man is going far in the business district
in 13 mins and 28 secs i saw spiderman in the backround
i undurstood one of the dudes at the shop where he bought water
He’s blessed us with another series!
Awesome
Props to Ryan for doing this I’m sure it’s harder than it looks. Not so easy begging people for money but god bless him much love ❤️
Dollar tree would’ve worked as well but i guess a discount store works 😉
Jesus loves y’all and you should go to church and be christian ❤❤
$10 for a hot dog is crazy
That shopkeeper was speaking Hindi lmao😂
you can now literally make it anywhere
Penny challenge cross the globe edition perhaps?????
You don’t have to say hi to everyone or even anyone 😊
10 FOR A GLIZZY that’s crazy I can get like a whole meal with $10 😂
Hmm. I don’t get it because You just stay as 1 cent for one minute and then  you sell the pen for cash and then is that more than 1 cent that’s STUPID
Kinda look like Casey Neistat
W
I’m sorry. hot dogs are 10$ in New York ?!
so wholesome and charismatic, his videos never cease to amaze!
Hello 👋
I don't know how it would work, but i REALLY want a caricature series. It's one of my favorite things ever.

Christian bs
That shop keeper who sold the water bottle was Indian 🤣😂
2:22 best part lmao 😂
the man at 3:40 asked her if she was crazy 😂
Why was the elevator door so small ?
The thieves in the shop overcharging for the water. They overcharge you and if you complain they say "sorry we made a mistake". Total thieving scum.
that shopkeeper was an Indian and he was scolding that girl in Hindi so that ryan couldn't understand
You still in ny?
Ryan should no joke make an hour long video of going from $0.01 instead of multiple videos
That Indian shop owner was mad as I could understand what he said 😅😂
if you are stress,you are a mess
Bro, I dare you to turn a penny into 1 million dollars in a month.
Hey RYAN TRAHAN this method was already tried by a youtuber named Hafu Go so please give him credit even if u didn’t know he existed
watching from Denmark
Basically the discount store owner said are you mad to her lol
3:50 That's why I feel proud to be an Indian
That man in the dollar store was actually calling his daughter pagal meaning mad
Ryan just do a full video of you doing caricatures it's actually wholesome!
Just to tell you he was saying in hindi - are you mad or what
we want a howdy counter
Howdy

The store owners talking in Hindi 🤣🤣🤣 the guy seems to be very mad at the girl for making the wrong calculations 😆😆😆😆
the shopkeeper was scolding the girl in hindi lol

Howdy definition should be: the word Ryan Trajan uses to communicate with others
Best 15 minutes of my life
3:34 he is literally saying .... Are you dumb (Aree tum pagal ho kya) in Hindi  He is probably an Indian American. Love to see an indian in your video Ryan ❤️
Hi alexis
I didn't have the patience to watch the full speedrun so I'm watching this. - J
He Is Trending!!
Awesome video 🙂
Keep going I’m a streamer i hope people know that they can do what ever
I love the videos u make can’t wait for u to be big
10$….. for a GLIZZY?!?!?!
This guy needs a dental company to sponsor him before he breaks his teeth.
How are PPL paying him through PayPal?
R we not gonna talk about the fact airrack was in the start but never talked or came back into the vid
to think that i spent 30 days of my summer watching the penny series eating velveta mac and cheese and i really just made some more to watch this video thank you for always coming in clutch with content ryan!
6:24 that CCTV just watching Ryan
I THINK NOODLES
Dude I think that shop owner is Indian, he speaks hindi😊
my name is isak
Shop keeper is indian
bro a hot dog for 10$ is a scam
I think what made the 0.01 Challenge work was that it was the purpose behind it. It was brilliant, and I (as a viewer) got to participate in a journey that ultimately changed lives. Your hustle for the cause allowed us to see humanity at work, which was both exciting and inspiring! I wonder how many other lives you change with your brilliance? Keep rocking, man!
3:35 bro is speaking Hindi (Indian language) feels nice
Me seeing Indians everywhere 😂
homie made minimum wage in Australia
When are you going to be the grandson of Dr phill.
You should go to all 50 states with 1 penny
3:32 nice
Since when do you say howdy that much? .__.
“I thought ur name was Brett” “it is it’s just Dylan for fun” 💀
Shout out to the camera man that has to run with him just as fast
Ryan is like that one NPC or player who only has one line of dialogue or says only one thing to other players or NPC      (Howdy 🤠)
does this mean u are gonna cross the world w a penny :O
i wonder how much you would make from doing scriptures all day
Bet that hot dogs yummy. Good job. Thanks for content
that intro though...
Is anyone feel bad for the girl in the store selling the water bottles and being yeld at whit the guy?
Bro the end is made in heaven
Man I have had such a bad day and this made it so much better! Thanks for making my day :)
“Howdy”😂
He can literally land atleast a grand in a few minutes just by going in every business establishment in any NYC locality and offer a brand collaboration.
😂 this is actually good
ayo arraick 0:27🤨
so no one is going to talk about how he payed $10 for a single hotdog
Nicole 😂😭😭😭😭😩😩
Oh Ryan all the pancakes I ate this summer watching you eat mcdonalds
🤨indian shopkeeper 🥸
ryan:hello today I speed run the life😂😂
how do you edit in drama and make 1 hour more eventful than it really is
The howdy
The camera man😳
POV you carried summer
20 an hour above minimum wage !!
Ryan loves pennys
I’m so mad I was in nyc when he was 😭
this man was worried about being hit by a car if you done this challenge in India he`d be dead
Lol the Indian man said these are crazy people
Yea NYC has tax plus $.05 cents deposit on all drinks should have done your research
10 dollars for a glitzy jeez
That’s more than most people make in an hour at a job.
Ryan is such a W person 🫶
Shout out to the camera man running with that heavy camera
I haven’t watch Ryan Trahan for so long last time he had 1m subs and I thought he had Kirk 2,25m but heh has 10,8m 😮
After selling the pen he thought gambling double or nothing was a good idea that was kinda cheating and already defeated the purpose of the video.
The fact that Ryan went from completely socially awkward to some one who can just walk up to strangers and hit it off is amazing! All after his 30 days across America Way to go Ryan!
it's crazy cause where he is is my normal route to the doctors
This video was the most wholesome thing ive ever came across
Howdy 👋 🤠 sorry 🫣
It's always the pens
What was that 8bit music in the intro??
Keep up the great work
You look like your in London
He could’ve insured freedom tower, then poured jet fuel on it to make a lot of money.
Bros obsessed
yes
did any one else get Casey niestat vibes right before he said"I feel like casey niestat. If he were un cordinated
No way Ryan was in nyc😭
I still remember klay 🥲
Xd
Let’s go
Let’s go
Props to cameraman
Ryan is one of the most awkward yet nicest people I have ever came past by 😂
Don’t forget to sprint jump it’s faster (:
I feel like the next thing he’s gonna do is one year would a penny
👏
The camera person just trying to chat h up bro 😂
Get iPhone 14 and use Action mode
Me who understood their arguments 😅
Ryan: does penny series across America and in New York for 1 hour. Everyone: penny series around the world?
Ryan is by far a great at content~
Crossing the earth from a penny challenge 🤨?
Around the world starting with a penny
Hey you could make above minimum wage doing this gig…
Man some of the people were kinda mean 😅 NYC what’s goin on??? 🤔
Man some of the people were kinda mean 😅 NYC what’s goin on??? 🤔
Is anybody gonna talk about how abnormally tall the one world trade center is in the backround Of the thumbnail?
now do upstate ny lol big dif
SCAM time
Yo Ryan I know you most likely won’t respond but I would love to see a video with you and Klay again from the 100 days in the meta verse. Plz do it and also keep up the good work 😊
My brother lives in Manhattan new yotk
Why don’t u just become a prostitute and get so much money
do another one across america those are so good
I would trade the penny for a pen, then for a dollar then put it in crypto and buy and sell till i can make 100. Probably easier thats just me tho
HOWDY ryan your the best
Nyc slays
I love this guy ❤hope u get to 100M
one penny around the world?
Yo hey haha what a coincidence Ryan my mummy is going there for vacation yeah…
hot dog is 10 bucks in NYC lol, what a joke
hes gotta be at least 5'14" tall
coughing when he laughs
Absolutely no one: Ryan: *haUGH*
I'm surprised he didn't get mugged
Something tourists don’t realize about New York… you can go around people in the street 😂
First speed run that requires running
you should have stopped by twin towers and had a moment of silence
You own this trend everyone else who does it seems like an imposter. I don't think it's simply because you're the original and it's a fun concept, but you do it with the best spirit I've seen in a creator in. my. entire. life.
$10 foe a hotdog?! thats expencive
It’s always where’s the camera man but never how’s the camera man 😢
The Spider-Man at 13:27
Ryan weird but brave “howdy” lol 😊”My quadriceps are deteriorating hi howdy we’re doing great howdy” bro says howdy more then I’ve said hi have good Ryan.😊
Weird video idea: go across America wearing roller blades the whole time😊

That owner of the store went "tum paagal ho kya" 😂 You can never take India out of an Indian guy.
BRUH I WAS JUST THERE 2 DAYS AGO

imagine knowing your in a youtube video with a guy that almost has 11 million subscribers, just to be known as " pen girls"
That convience store guy just called that girl an idiot lol
13:27 spider man in the background 😳
9:26 why that dude blurred out? ',:l
Why are all these people going to New York it’s really not that good I live here and I don’t feel good about it
Ok coming from an artist those first paintI he we’re actually pretty good
from the state i come which is NY everything is more expensive & cooler
The earth at the end is foreshadowing for "travelling accross earth with one penny"
Ryan: first sub target 1 million second target 100 million
You never fail to entertain me, and btw at the shop were you bought water, I speak that language and the guy was calling her crazy and stuff
$10 for a fucking hot dog?

ryan is such a awesome nice and funny guy
howdy
2:36
Ryan how the fuck do you do this😍
I love the “hGaHs”
Was great, try that in other cities too!
Damn I wish I could get one 60 sec drawing like that, get a signature slapped on and I’d pay $50😂
How many pens do u have
:0 your in New York!!
it's good to see Ryan having fun and making friends also keep up the good work love your vids especially the $0.01 challenge I would get so excited when you would update another because I would watch every time
I think Ryan took some drawing lesson, some of the characters he drew were actually good 😃
He passes the same hotel I stayed at when I went to nyc
Ryan is friendly,awkward,polite,relatable,confident   Man he has so much personalities
ryan’s laugh is so contagious
Comment
Ryan , you are living a life man ...
The hustle and bustle line to the massive zoom out to the world makes me think there might be a Penny series around the world 🙀
Ryan’s art skills are literally great within 60 seconds love ur videos 🎉😂
Indians are rocking in New york also😂😂😂😂😂😂
Bro got the dream speedrun strats
Ryan is one of the best creators ever.

Hey have yall seen the "a message to ryan" video from jimmy madison?
Last time I recall a hotdog only 2 dollars🤔
Next name: I milked the $0.01 challenge
I thought he was at 13 million subscribers not 10
I think Ryan was there meeting Casey
Ryan, in my opinion you are one of the most hardworking/ determined YouTuber I have ever seen. Keep it up brother, and keep drinking your daily coffee!
Ryan trahan I bet you can make it to 100 million subscribers in the next 3 years
He scolded her in hindi
It was not only Penny challenge but I'm surprised to see your energy level. Well done Ryan!
8:30 THEY ARE INDIAN
i understood the conversation with the discount store owner and the employee that man was not happy
U could've stole that money in a sec
Yo my guy, how much you payed for your girlfriend? I know you can buy them Asians and it’s legal
Penny budget dream
that the first shop people were indian
are bagal ho tum  lmao 3:35
that guy was indian , the shopkeeper
howdy ryan
why is ryan’s handwriting actually so good 😮
Howdy
airrack was in the beginning
Do it in London next
So fun😄
When he bought the water this is what the guy said Are you crazy? How did you put 75 cents on top of the price? *after he came back* Isle number E Then what is this?
Amazing vid and extremely hilarious to see Ryan just running around like a lunatic saying howdy everywhere
2:49 so relatable
post the other attempts
how many times did he say " howdy " in the vid ?
15:20 there is a statue of liberty from wish in the backround
when you realise there is an Indian uncle saying "pagal ho kya" at 3:35
I understood what those first shop guys told as I'm from India , nice to see Indian in nyc . love from India
Howdy
Workplace drama ... Yes its Indians
3.35 Indian 🤣
Pagal ho kya, they were talking in hindi from india. I'm from india as well
"I'm gonna go get a glizzy" is a phrase I never thought I would hear from Ryan's mouth
lol
Try trade 10 000 to penny 🥶
14:41  spider-man
oh i'm a new subscriber
try doing this in Europe Netherlands since in the Netherlands everyone speaks English good luck
IT WAS $10 FOR A GLIZZY?!?!!?!!
Ryan interacting with Indians turns into biggest workplace drama
the discount shopkeepers were indians
Jesus loves you all and died for our sins
me understanding the conversation in the store at the beginning between the to people, I'm dead🤣
08:27 they are taking in hindi
The memories...
me listen him panting and saying HOWDY: 😐😐
Homless people seeing this video are gonna try this no cap
ryan saying howdy agin again
Watching this in the middle of class rn lol😂
3:38 the man actually said are you stupid in Hindi i translated lol
Th subtitles,*Pen girls laugh* Uhh? (:
I am youtuber
Do you even know what he said in the shop
So So So Much MOTIVATED Content .... I love the way you make it money 💰
The first shop you  bought a bottle that is a Indian right 3:37
taking a second to slow  down and - Right here dude?
when he was baying 3 bottles of water they argue and said in english "you are mad or what"
The guy from the discount store is an Indian, He is speaking Hindi.
He said howdy to most of the people he met
Ryan is easily the most likeable guy ever. Why wouldn’t you buy a water from him?
anyone else see jeffery dahmer at 5:52 ?
😂🇵🇰🇵🇰🇵🇰
1 penny man
You can clearly tell he's really kind with his gestures
Seemsclike somexworthless b s. Just morev media drama
If you started with caricatures you will earn a lot of money from the begining
Me in New York
He shopkeeper speaking hindi india
Hi
they were talking in hindi
i still regret not watching ep 1 of the 1 penny challenge when it came out
OMG RYAN THE ADRENALINE IS STILL HERE!
my plan B if i ever go broke it this i did my calculations 3.5k in a week 😱
this is a penny
Yo, I knew exactly what the shop boss was saying to the cashier because it was in hindi, he said "You are mad!, How did you overprice it?" Then "There was tape here, *showing it to the cashier* what is this huh?'
3:25 INDIANS YEEEEE
So moral of the story you can make $20 dollars an hour doing random stuff on the street
My man never settle for just ok Respect for you
dude really paid $10 for a hot dog???????
Nani?! Preston the cameraman
Those indian workers really show affection to ryan and people across new york great video by the way
The cackle at 2:39 made my day
are they indians working at store😂
Ryan is pushing himself further and further.and I respect that
*THIS, IS A PENNY*
That food delivery was 8 bucks for like 12 minutes of your time. I think the water strategy may have been stronger as it escalated. Thanks for the fun content.
Are we not gonna talk abt the spider man at 13:28
Have a good day
Ryan tells movies to watch him.
Oh no here we go again  You milked this serie so much , iam still going to watch it tho
So if you did this for a week how much would you make 😊
Even though the video is good,I think we can all agree that the video isn't as fun without "THE GREAT RESET"!!
You are so cute ☺️ hahah omgggg
If you think new York is huge come to Mumbai. Love your vids
Did anyone notice that there were Indians in the shop
the people in store are arguing in Hindi to not to make a fool out of him Indians are so generous
i swear ryan is the most shy and awkward but yet the most socially active and friendly man i've ever seen
Ryan Why is Airrack In Ur video???
I need to see an uncut version of this.
HES BACK?!!!!!!!!!!!
Lol if someone did not know what they said in the dollar store(I actually speak there language)he called her crazy Lol
ryan is officially out of new video ideas and will still be doing different variations of the penny challenge when he is in his 60's.
4:00
we watched ur entire speedrun 1/4 of the ctual time
u got above minimum wage yay
Yo Ryan you do the penny speed run in nj
It's workplace drama because they're Indians... 😂
ryan it's just the fact that you were so dedicated to this video idea that you've done 7 attempts, that's crazy and I am genuinely inspired 😂❤‍🔥
*speedrun
I bet he wouldn't be able to do this speedrun if he was black. Running in NYC is asking to be stopped by the police?
I'd like to see him travel the world in a year on one penny.
I mean a world one penny would be sooooooooooooooooo good? Like if u agree Lets let him know we want it
bro got the best seed
A glizzy in the Philippines is just 2dollars so if you want to save just got to Philippines and spend it
Man speak hindi
U could buy 10 water in Phil with 2 bucks
As person who understands hindi/urdu that workplace was something alright
cool video, I also have a lot of videos, come in, I'll be glad
He deserves soooo much more subs!❤❤
Those were Indian and were saying are you mad
You are awesome
ryan made more in an hour than i do at work right now.
I love you

The first interection of indian language in ryan trahan video 3:35
Happy 7th Oktober Birthday
one thing i learn you dont need lots on money to start a bussiness
nice video, 5 on trending, also the statue of liberty at 15:20 looks kinda goofy.
Should’ve ended with your chipotle and a McDonald’s coffee
1 penny in a different country, or around the world
That Asian dad's disappointment in math🤣
I challenge you to throw a dart to determine where you will do this challenge first country then state
Howdy Ryan
Ryan has taught me that there is no way to sound awkward when saying “howdy” to the point that I use it on a daily basis
52nd *howdy*
Howdy 52
You to be honest I actually like videos like these cuz it makes me feel intense by being rushed by time trying to make money from scratch
Damm from 3 million to 10 million since the last time i saw you
Been subbed before 1 mil and he never fails to make such good content
This honestly gave me so much nostalgia from the penny series
You should do a challenge where you start with 1000 dollars and go to a Penney but when you buy something you don’t tell them for how much you buy it for
3:35 he said are you mad :)
20$ and hour isn’t bad money. Keep up the grind king
Man I love your videos so much. Keep up the PHENOMENAL work. Edit: also, Howdy
Next video I went across The world on 1 cent
He should have worked at McDonald’s😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
ryan should cross the world starting $10 that would be fun to watch
Hello
Vid idea: go to a different country and cross it with a penny of whatever there money is
hi
wow congrats man! 4 mil views in 1 day
The Indian guy was a goat
You should do a challenge where you compete with someone else and see who makes more money
Dude, your comment sections are full of spambots.
So nobody is gonna mention the fact that glitzy costed $10?
the girl saying for what 😭
Hi
When I feel anxious, Ryan always knows how to make me smile😊
😁
I love how he says howdy everyminute
$10 for a Glizzy man dang
HOWDY
I thought this guy was done with the penny
Let’s go Ryan
I WAS THERE A WEEK AGO 😭😭😭
You should deliver a penny to someone in Canada this summer

Go to every country starting with one penny

Time mark 13:27 Spider-Man
Bro, I was in NYC when you were filming this, I literally saw you trying out a Citi Bike and I was trying to get through the crowd and say hi but you started running, lol!
please do a whole video on caricatures😭
10 for a glizzy is wild
Ok the end kinda scared me
Was that hotdog actually $10....
ryan’s videos are so entertaining i love how he stayed in new york the entire time and i was still on the edge of my seat
all you need to do this speedrun is 1 penny and a $500 smartphone with a food delivery app installed
Props to you man! The idea of "speedrunning" the penny challenge was awesome. You're quickly becoming one of my favorite YouTubers. God bless!
“How does anyone navigate around here”… pure willpower and shear idea of embarrassment
At 3:50, the owner was talking in hindi and I can understand it.
Why was the hot dog 10 dollars
He is producing the best content of the year off of profiting off a penny. Kinda sad but happy for him at the same time
Can someone unblock the addicted video game kid dr phill reaction?
I wish I could meet u bc I'm in my rn but il it's impossible I can only dream of it
The I ❤New York sweater lol 😊
Ryan needs to do penny challenge on going across the world back to America

bro made above minimum wage
This video is sponsored by 5th Avenue Dollar Discount 😂
It would’ve been cool if you were live streaming it so if someone donated it would’ve activated “THE GREAT RESET”
Ryan’s editor: how many times can a penny be used as a video  Ryan: because
any one els see that spider-man in the back when he was drawing
5:01 He has iOS 16 that means that video was recorded after the first week of September which is sick honestly
Me understanding the language  of the workplace drama damn
Am I Thor only one who saw spider man
You got scammed for that glizzy fam
15:08
13:28 Spider-man looking sad after no way home.
That laugh he made after he got two dollars is undeniably the best laugh ever
Bro I believe you can do this challenge did you want Acosta country I was like how
LETS GOOOOO
howdy😊
Omg! You gone an Indian shop for water
Ryan, I enjoyed this video so much, not surprising as I enjoy everyone of your videos😁... Loved the speed run through of the penny challenge and in New York 🔥 *chefs kiss*  Keep bringing us this awesome and innovative content Ryan!
all that for a hot dog 😭
The thumbnail looks like a cool video game
Can you make a 5 stranger's vs 1 imposter season 2?

Ryans natural ability to say incoherent sentences making everyone say incoherent stuff is amazing
Putting this comment here means that i have cemented myself in the penny challenges via comment :)
Go to Philadelphai!?
$10 Glizzy FOH
Hold the Efffff on buddy you really paid $10 for a hot dog 😂😂😂😂
Amazing video
🔓
Me living in New York sad I didn’t get to see him be like😢
Jesus was known as Wonderful, Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace, plus many other names. And when people do not understand the bible it's because they are not "born again" and indwelled with the Holy Spirit.  And you can have Jesus for free without going across America, just follow the instructions below.   (John 3:3 > Jesus answered and said to him, [Nicodemus] "Most assuredly, I say to you, unless one is born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.) (John 3:5 > Jesus answered, Most assuredly, I say to you, unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God.)  May you find the Lord Jesus, repent and believe and have eternal life in Him. Amen!
Ryan is so legendary for this
Try this challenge in north ridgeville Ohio I’ve been there before to see family and everything there is close by and so much nice people
Nice video 👍👍

Wow that’s an expensive hot dog. You could have gotten a Margo Coney Dog for two dollars.

Howdy

Wait wait wait the guy that Ryan played Rock Paper Scissors at 1:52 may be my teacher because he looks and sounds like him , he a So said he was going on vacation
Is it just me or could this be like a super cool game show? Imagine: 3 contestants have an hour in New York city and the winner with the most money gets the 10x that amount.
14:54 .  I thought that guy was kevin hart
I feel so bad for the worker at the discount store understanding what they're saying, the guy was just really sassy and called her an idiot
Y’all this just proved that literally anyone with a little bit of determination and perseverance can make 20$ an hour with ease.
Ryan is so awkward but charismatic and polite. Literally so cool
lol
8:06 Cobra Kai Hawk reference?
Yesssssssssssssssssss
10$ for a glizzy is crazy
I am surprised he brought all of us back here by holding up a penny

Hey 👋 guys. Jesus say, "But when the Son of man comes, will there be any faith on earth?" If you follow the Bible you will know that most all of the 1,800 prophecies has come to pass. Once the final few happen Jesus Christ will return. Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit. Jesus is the Way the truth and the life. He accepts you no matter where you've been.

Lov3 the vids but I hate ny bc of climate change 😢
well that’s more then we get in germany (12€) in one hour
Those who know the “workplace drama” 😂😂 Those who don’t 🗿💀🫥
Just found out that Ryan is 2 days younger than me and he did so many crazy and also generous things. Big respect! Also I'm sending greetings from Czech (Europe) 🇨🇿 🇪🇺
a glizzy for 10 dollars what.
I see what you did there with the ending 😏Can't wait
The Statue of Liberty just standing there at the end
That laugh made my day ♥️😂 Love you Ryan
If you would work for 8 hours you would get 164.8$ and a month 5k$
I also had a penny once. 🎉
4th on trending nice,only got beat by football and Coc.
F in the chat for Katie who wanted to do a caricature for someone but was told to hold the sign instead 😔✊️
You shoukd try this challenge in mississippi it would be a challenge for sure
Ryan, you're an entrepreneurial madman and I love it. Lol
Yes I live in Florida
Why was airrack there in the video?
“Scared money don’t make money”, people who are scared to spend money won’t make money
POV: You're from India and understood the workplace drama 🤣
"Howdy"
First time seeing the penny challenge.  That was fun to watch.
speedran
Ok
this is what Youtube needed ahaha - once again ! yessssssss
21
Zz
I don’t know weather Ryan’s awkward or not anymore😂
o woww
That store owner got a stick up his
the Asian women like in vibin as well totally not knowing what actually is happening over there
Fun to watch.  Keep up the great videos.
Everyone who hopes ryan makes a new series next summer use this as the vote button
The in the beginning when he was in the store the people were indian
You and your 1 penny series are a LEGEND bro 🔥
the work place drama had to be from india 💀💀
When is travelling across the world with just one penny happening
Howdy
a hotdog in nyc? you should’ve gotten a slice!!!
Yes
Ryan should try to across the whole world with one penny
$10 for a glizzy , that’s crazy
"Pagal ho tum" Got me🤣
Ryan in the las penny challenge was always like “I’ve got a feeling that tonight’s going to be a good night that tonight’s going to be a good night that tonight’s going to be a good good night!”
3:36 "are tum kya pagal ho?" Only Indians can understand
i dont think he realizes if you ask people where subway is in NY it’s different than anywhere else
woah
Bro zoomed out on the wrong country and state
yaha tape tha yeh kya hein (typical indian parent behaviour innit)
9:00  the way he just laughs it off. i could never
Yuuuh congrats on trending lmao
Preston?!
new york didn’t know what hit it when ryan arrived. no one talks or even smiles at people in new york. i almost got ran down by a bicycle on the brooklyn bridge.
howdy howdy howdy howdy
"You guys have a great day" "Okay"
Bro that girl working at that dollar store is so lost 😆
The shopkeeper literally said pagal ho kya bro so rude omg
ryan literally is using the best seed
Ryan remember that one person who gave you a pen for a penny on your 3 day penny challenge they started it all
D girl getting yelled in Hindi is d most funniest part dude 🤣🤣..."yarr pagal ho tum?"😂
We find indian in every corner
You know they'd pay 2 dollars for a water on doordash too, some people are too selfish.
Come to chicago
at this point ryan should just be on the penny
He just scam those dude
Spider man in the back😂13:27
i  ate two bowls of chicken noodle soup while watching this
This proves that anyone can make money
But he failed his penny challenge because he used his phone which he did not buy with the penny.
Haha  No
Keep up the good work
Yo what's the seed
Amazing video as always
why did the very end give me goosebumps
What's the intro song called?
“ i can do both of you guys in 60 sec” pause
2:50 kinda sus look at his head
You should do this in buffalo ny
you know you highlighted new york state, right?
Rng is amazing for this run
"HOWDY"

When Ryan laughs “hehehe” 😂 another dub vid
Actualy The Shop Owner was an Indian Telling Her are You Mad
100% not done in an hour.
Bro o was in time square like a week ago 😭😭😭
The Ultimate Penny Speedrun
At the beginning, you said that NYC was the commerce capital of the world. Others would argue it could also be London. You should test this, by doing it in London (start in Trafalgar Square) and whichever one makes you more, is the true commerce capital of the world.
3:33 was my indian guy saying "are you crazy?"
i saw him in NY, i didnt think it was him.
Respect for the camera when they are running we didnt hear him saying huhuhu idk English ik
binn here  since 2 mill glag your vids doing so well
actullay the shop drama was his father was  shouting at him in hindi
Ryan do be finessing people tho 😂😂😂😂😂

10.00 for a hotdog he got himself ripped off
I am howdy count: very much😭🤣🤣
wait did you just pay 10$ for a 3$ hotdog?

i always thought doing the penny challenge here in NYC wouldn’t work but Ryan is too charming
Nice
If you could you please put show us all your attempts that would be wonderful.  if you agree pls leave a thumbs up to my comment so Ryan knows to show us all his attempts
Ryan, you came to the right place. "Howdy" is the point where he tries to cover his worry!
craaaazzzzzyyyyyy
HOWDYYY
That person at counter was speaking hindi or urdu
I'm pakistani, I understood everything the shop-keeper said the guys so mean 🤣
3:34 lmao hes calling the girl stupid
Indian guy was the most important person here or the plan would have failed 😆🇮🇳🇮🇳
👽
🪙
You can't survive 20 dollars in NYC. So, you don't have money to pay for hotel.  This is why some countries ban YouTube and Google.  The reason why they banned. it Adsense scams. Other banks in other countries aren't falling for it. Inflation.
howdy
I am a youtuber
More Ryan Please!!!
I would pay Ryan to say howdy to me
the laugh running always gets me 😂
The shopkeeper was indian and said yeh kya hai means what is this?
these are always so wholesome vids to watch. Good job Ryan.
If you like ny hit up albany
I SAW HIM AT NEW YORK BUT I COULDN'T CATCH UP TO TAKE A PICTUREEEE!!!!
They were Indian and I am an Indian so I know that drama
What was that ending? You going to space now?
15:24 next penny or something else challenge probably penny challenge 🤔 maybe  😳
The ending is like a sequel for something. Suriving 1 year around the world with 1 penny?
JARED HMMMMMMMMMM HMMMMMMMMMMMMM IF U KNOW THEN U KNOW
3:50 that women was charging u extra until the man came in. either she didn't know maths or she was trying to scam u.

He is the guy who would prevail in any situation... love you man :)
O
The workplace drama/people at "5th ave dollar discount" were talking in hindi, can't believe! I know that because I am an Indian.

Imagine having Ryan Trahan deliver your food 😂
"Pagal hai tu"
It was a really good video 📸

I think I'm going to start using the phrase, "You guys, I have to go, I'm doing a speed run," during the course of normal conversations I find myself in at church, or the store, or with my kids...
Went from morning to dark in 1 hour
Howdy !!!! Finally your back bro
When your apparent self-designated  teachers assume your ignorant because they have spent your entire life creating those conditions around you to sustain that level of diminishment hoping to elevate themselves above you,, Only to discover that they are far more ignorant than I could ever be with 1/8 of the opportunity they have enjoyed during their best case scenario life style  ....shame what a shambles...
Great Job Ryan 👍 You’re #1 on trending
is the end a teaser for next year?
So glad the penny videos are back XD
HOWDY
Ryan:Howdy! Stranger:I've seen u 10 times
Can anyone tell me the song used in the intro?
3:40 the guy was screaming at her in hindi the translation is are you mad are you out of your mind ive taught you so many times
He could've EASILY broken $1k by walking around in makeup and high heels and using the tried and tested: "I'll do anything you want baby 😏"
Boss : How do we increase our financial profit 📈.  Ryan: ''Give me a penny"
A
the indian guy saying 'pagal ho tum' meaning you are a fool
but why are my aunt and uncle named Brandon and Vanessa
i thought the secret ingredient was weed
Ryan is such an amazing person, Hailey is so blessed to have him
This is like one of the  most likely times for him to be recognized but also the worst because he has no time to talk to fans
NOBODY CARES
What's the song used in the intro called?
Kiya pagal ho tum 🤣🤣😂
Bro the shop from where you buy 3 water bottle they was talking in my language
W
Ryan And Penny Is The Greatest Combination Ever.🙂💀
As a Pakistani I understood everything when the workplace drama was taking place lol

I was just thinking of the penny challenge the other day so this just made my monday
Oh no, the ending gave me an existential crisis, ☹️
When he said “preston ima hop on this bad boy” I thought he was talking to me Becuz my name is preston
nice work
Your social skills are incredible and your very polite to everyone around you, it's been a pleasure watching the video. Keep up the grate work. (edit: after writing and posting this I saw the description, you did grate for 0 social skills!)
I think we can all agree that he now has at least 1 social skill
I love Ryan and his videos. But I didn’t really like this one that much. What’s the point of doing it timed if there is no outcome unlike the penny challenge
Imagine having to live here my whole life 6:06
am i the only one or everybody thinks ryan is addicted by howdy  Btw the biggest fn of urs that ever existed
was the outro a hint for a nother penny challenge?
i have to say this was THE MOST ryan way to introduse a sponsorship lmao
Hahaha Ryan saying hello to people in New York is hilarious
Isn't the "tourist capital of the world" Bangkok?
3:50 Let's goo Indian's coming in helpp

School lunch bussnes be like:
14:57 countdown 10 seconds
Dang man entertainment for sure too bad it wasn’t financially sound lol I’m sure the experience was nice lol ❤
I appreciate ur efforts in making a single few mins video
First, i was wondering if Tommy did an NYC vlog, then he made an entire fricking series in NYC. Then i was wondering if Ryan had tried the one penny challenge in NYC, and then he fricking does it. Awesome timing!
Dylan taking a L for not donating
At 3:37 that man said “are you stupid/ crazy?
Camera stabilization could be a nice choice next time
Wow

Hey Ryan, there is a situation right now in Iran where women and children as young as 10 are being brutally beat to death by the Iranian government. Please use your following and share this with others. I am just 13 and I don't know if my closest family members are ok in Iran because they've shut off the internet. Thank you so much.
when he was buying paper and things the cashier was muslim Just like me :)
They should make a speedrun category on the website for this to be honest, we could get some insane moneymaking strategies down as a community lmao! One question though: Why not?
people who understand hindi would have got the watter bottle shopkeeper part
You’re so funny heh heh heh >.< laughter 😂😂🫣
He is the legend of our generation
3:43 the nice indian guy hahaha
The indian man at the water place😭
That ending lol
Man I wanted to see his last McDonald’s meal at the end

I think that at 3:45 the man is speaking Hindi🙃
Ten mil subs nice
" have a good day "  " okay " is it that hard to say " oh yeah , you too "  goddam
It's so surprising to me how he does this because where I live there's no stores and the closest city like thing has the worst stores possible

Ryan's next challenge travelling around the world with 1 Penny
What happened to the money you were supposed to donate
Those shopkeepers at the discount store were Indians  *Did anyone noticed
Ryan in the store u bought 3 water bottles the girls father was saying him in Urdu (TUM PAGAL HOO TUM KU AAYI HO STORE MAIN) in English it means are you crazy why are you working in the store if u don't know the price he was scolding his daughter 😅
This looks like a strategy game speedrun
i think hes gonna cross the world for a 100-365 days 😂
5:28 other people probably thought he was robbing it xd
"This is the craziest night of my life" says the man who almost froze to death while playing fortnite in the middle of the desert in the cheapest air bnb o_o
Nicoles Caricature looking like Dream's Face Reveal
do a 60 second one.
He zoomed out of South America
3:35 : Pagal ho kia (hindi) Are You Crazy(english)  Btw im not indian im pakistani
Bruh, 3.2 mil in 12 hours is dummy. Welcome back.
Ryan in 2069 be like: WE ARE GONNA TRAVEL THE ENTIRE WORLD IN 100 DAYS WITH JUST A PENNY
camera man moment
This will end when he do this across the world 😂
That end makes me think he's gonna do something crazy this time, I don't know if it's what I think he'll do (travelling the world with a penny) or if it was just a cool outro
Last girl wanted it bad but his mind was on the glizzies 🤦🏼‍♂️🤦🏼‍♂️
You missed a few time-saves here and there but ultimately it was a good run. Great job Ryan!
Damm
nice man i like you vids, will you finsh the speedrun?
That shopkeeper guy was scolding her

Omg og penny
that shopkeeper was sepaking in Hindi and i totally get what he was saying
trending one 🙃
I Hope,One Day My Country Will Be Like That
no one is going to talk about the Indian store guy?😂
I can translate the argument -- the guy just asked her if shes crazy
Mans vibes are immaculate its like watching socrates do magic
Its weird that I laughed on the Indian store owner (from where he bought water) after he yelled at his daughter/worker 🤣🥲   That is because I'm Indian and i know what he said lol
That's the best series i have ever watched on YouTube. I don't think no can beat this type of content Even I like your trading skills.
YOUTUBE CAPTIONS : “AUDI!!!” Ryan : “HOWDY!!”
Cool
The Indian or Pakistani uncle saying Tum Pagal ho gai ho kia
Ryan looks like Terry Fox
Ryan passing someone *Howdy*

3: 34- when it said “pagal ho tum”, in hindi that means “are you crazy?”
lol
Hey I give you 2 dollars and you didn't put me in the video
"Just don't get hit by a vehicle" man definitely got hit on his past 7 attempts
Ryan what about try this one Penny series for 1 full year, it may be so much fun, u could probably reach 50M
hes back at it again
ugh, he started it again!  (btw that was a good ugh)
Ryan really did put in so much effort in this video just  to entertain us and put a huge smile on our face, he deserves much more than this. WE LOVE YOU RYANN ❤
As an Indian, I understoodwhat they said in workplace drama :D
outro👌
The sun has set more than an hours worth bro.
Indian people knows what that shopkeeper said
I don't know why but That Indian guy was so rude with that girl he should know how to respect women:⁠'⁠(
*penny* 👇
wasn't expecting the earth jumpscare at the end

Hey @ryan when you buy the water bottle the shopkeepers says " abey tum log pagal ho " and if you dont know that this is an hindi word and the shopkeeper was indian
Is 20$/h alot in new york for living? Ig not right?

so your telling me you were somewhere at coumbia? 15:24
09:59 I can relate
Still proud of u ryan.
The random "howdy's" throughout out the video got me 😂
He’s so relatable and it’s nice to have a YouTuber that isn’t scared of being social
Ryan has officially mastered the art of the penny
RYAN YOUR #1 ON TRENDING
The ship owner was indian
Honestly Ryan makes some of the most enjoyable content
new challenge: go to McDonald’s, get an iced coffee, and take a sip every time ryan says howdy😅😭
3:35 they are talking in hindi
A hotdog in New York is 10 dollars?😳
the shop owner was super nice and he was a Indian
Ryan: *breaths in* "HOWDY"
bro is so unapologetically akward
Yeah $20 in an hour isn't too bad, but he also started with 1 penny haha so that's wayyyy harder than just like, delivering 2 or 3 food orders or something boring like a job
That indian dude was absolutely roasting the woman
I'm actually intrigued if someone can do this challenge without the cameraman following close and without telling people it's an experiment, I want to see how far they could go.
Those guys were INDIANS!!!!
Bro’s got Dream luck
Dub Ryan Man
Ryan if you want i can tell what they are taking they are speaking Hindi and i speak Hindi they are saying were tape and are you dumb etc 😂
the indian dude😂😂....only Indian know what happened
this guy is just begging 🤣
2:39 mh-HEHEHEHE
I literally screamed when I saw this video 😅
You lunatic
whats the name of the song in the intro?
🗿
Ryan speedrunning irl commerce
I love this guy
3:34 *tum paagal ho kya* hahaahahaha anybody from India can relate😆🤣🤣
That indian shopkeeper must her dad..I mean the way he talks to her sounds so much familiar.😃
3:30 shopkeeper talking in hindi. WOW....GREAT video ryan
Ryan:makes a video getting 20 dollars from a penny in an hour  My little brother that wants a 20 dollar game but only has a dollar:I know what I must do
17 hours late
I am scared only because Ryan’s outro was him zooming out of the earth… this could mean something, just saying
What’s up with Dylan not paying you
You would have made more money if you had simply used the 6 bucks to buy more water and sell it, and then do the drawing , the door dash just wasn’t worth it
Ryan is so friendly to everyone he’s so sweet he’s like a living teddy bear I admire his wholesome personality
Man at 3:38 speaks hindi  He is a Indian
This was moderately stressful but very entertaining!
3:35 they said in urdu "are you crazy? yeah i know you are" and at 8:26 i think he was saying "why are you telling him to go to aisle 1-e when the tape is right here" or something to that extent
the store water bottle people were talkin in Hindi
Ryan: I have to run 2 blocks   Me: the cameraman dose to
Yo mama
I loved the series, it passed so much time and made it enjoyable. I watched it everyday at work. Awesome video, Love the content.
i thought you were going to mrbeast on 1 hour
The work place drama was lowkey sad the dude getting triggered cause that one girl made some simple mistakes 😢
Bro had a really devious laugh at 2:39-2:42
if this man loses all his money and goes bankrupt, just give him a penny
Katie never got the caricature
Do the penny challenge in the uk
Wo you bought that bottles from a indian  store ....
I've lived in the city and the county and something I know is when someone waves while driving you can tell they are most likely from the Midwest/rural area, if they flip you off while driving they are from a large city or the coasts. When they try and walk around you at the store someone people from the Midwest/rural area will say something like howdy/pardon/I'm gonna sneak right by ya where as someone from the city will probably say excuse me in the rudest way possible if they even act like they know you exist.
Howdy 🤟  Can please do the penny challenge in am middle school 🤟🤟🤟
13:28 spider man bottom right
“Ah sh- here we go again”
he got a lucky spawn
:0 is the end a teaser for getting across the world with 1 penny?!??
"Camera stabilization" is a great invention.   Great video!
You should do 1 he in every state
Katie is awesome 🎉
Survive on a penny for 100 days unless you’re scared
Idea: he redoes the one month penny challenge but instead of crossing america across🇺🇸 the world and he was 3-4 months or a WHOLE YEAR with diffrent donations options like 150k to give him money or stuff like that? 🎉
Ryans next penny challenge " I Traveled Across The World Starting From $0.01  in 1 Year"
Burger king pays 8 bucks an hour, I could caricatures under 5 min and get 12 bucks 💀💀
I love your videos dude
These people where u brought water from they were speaking urdu and I understood what they said lol
Kya pagal ho tum.....only indians know😚😚✌✌
When you get dream luck:
who else remembers him at like only 600k subs?
#1 trending video let’s gooooo. Speed ran to the top too.
The store you bought water bottles was owned by Indian people because when they were arguing they were speaking Hindi  Much Love from India Ryan
Howdy goodness
The guy and girl at 3:35are Indian, i am an Indian too, that why I can understand what they are saying, the man called the girl "PAGAL" in HINDI which means crazy in English, it's so good that Ryan crashing into Indians.
3:25 bruh that Indian guy though 💀💀
Bro this guy is milking the 0.01$ challenge I swear it’s appearing on my home page so often it’s kinda funny lol
3:45, they were speaking in hindi and as far as i know, the girl must felt like hell at that time, i know this cause imma indian too😂
try in Europe. i love your contents so much
Wow
2:48 A flashback of my childhood while im trying to get back home under a minuet after buying a dishwasher
does anyone else think that its kinda cheating doin delivery when the profit technically doesn't come from the penny?
Ryan should give a penny to pewdiepie
That Indian guy was screaming at the girl in Hindi “Are you crazy?!”😂
bro where did spider man come from
Bro, ending was so wholesome <3
3:35 "ky pagal ho kya"🤣🤣🤣
Why wouldn't he just stick to waterbottles
Being from NYC makes this video wild. Seeing NYC from an outside perspective is neat
This young gentleman is gold. He’s such a sweetheart. #1 on trending!
Like for PETITON FOR RYAN TO CROSS THE GLOBE USING 1 PENNY DAY 1
If the sponsorship money counts then you did really good.
bro i just realized that the shopkeepers were indians
Its my b-day in a week can i get a happy b-day?
Bro is the ultimate hustler 😂
I'm just sad no one triggered "THE GREAT RESET!!" 😂
You don't need a nervous laugh every time you make a joke
Did anyone notice the store owners were talking in hindi
I live in Nyc and I’ve never heard someone say howdy
outer space episode coming next?
Please tell me the end is a hint too something he is gonna do with space ik its not but still
‘I travelled the world starting with one penny’
These prices go crazy
those shopkeepers were indian, damn tht man is most probably tht girl's dad..... he scoulded her for her bad maths hehe
10.7M
Ryan is simultaneously the most confident yet socially awkward person I have ever seen
This is so good! Well done
NYC recap!
I am Indian and those two people who were arguing were speaking in Hindi and the guy called the girl crazy LOL
14:41 bro really said Dream 💀
nice people there
It makes it easier to watch
W camera man
howdy
😍😍😍
wait it was all the time in panama city
Number 1 trending
Like are how many times he said howdy
But the glitzy afterwards🤣🤣
why do i actually want to do this irl when i grow up
That guy in show while buying water was indian
the people at the workplace were indian and i could understand every word pf what they were saying
You should try the 13 colonies
the videographer surely died after this 😂
Day 34 of trying to get my Comment famous
One penny series  but the money you get you will donate it
I just like every second he says "HOWDY!"
whoa
These videos just keep getting better 😮‍💨
I have a feeling he is planning something big, bigger than the America series
The owner of the dollar store was INDIAN😂
Keep Calm and Howdy
bro got an insane seed
this dude will never fail to impress us
Bro I got a good video idea called speed running life
I was there with my school in New York City. You don’t navigate the city you just walk around until you find what you want or you just use GPS
I got a good video idea, the title is going to be called speed running life.
3:35 💀 tum pagal ho kya? meaning *are you mad or wot?*
try to survival in czech rep.. you know what its the bad they have own money🤫if you do it i will follow you and like all your videos,deal?
Why’s he doing that forced laugh after 80% of his sentences?
Nice RNG bro
I can make animations for you ❤
30 minute hotdogs 🌭
🗿Rock aprroved 🗿
That workplace drama was in hindi so probably they are indian
I'm more impressed how he went back to this penny challenge just after 2 different type of video after he did the marathon.. I thought he'd at least wait a year before doing it again.  But it's got 3m views as of this writing so who am I to judge. lmao Looking forward to his future contents. Hopefully something different
Bro you're such a liar. You said it in the video series that you paid for the hotels upfront before the challenge. Why are you changing your story now?
Howdyy
Ryan is the equivalent as if you just maxed out charisma in fallout.
Tbh think he would've made more money if he just delivered food, but he had to do different things for the content as it wouldn't be very entertaining for him to just say "I did deliveries for the rest of the challenge and got 1,000$ bye"
I watch all those
The laugh tho “HeHEHEhehe” got me laying on the florr
can you post the raw vid?
“pen girls laughing” 😂
bruh
This man is both the most awkward and most confident man I have ever seen.
“She calculates everything wrong!” Aww I felt so bad for that sweet lady, her boss seemed like an asshole to her both times that you went to that shop😢but love that the penny challenge (of sorts hehe 😉) is back 😁 I’ll take a speed run over no penny challenge at all any day  😅
The fact that he made more than minimum wage in 1 hour is telling me something about the economy.
No
Ryan's drawing actually could sell more than the money they gave him lmao
Everyone in New York makes fun of you for putting ketchup on your hotdog by the way. And don’t call it a Glizzy if you ain’t from the streets
use the iPhone 14 while filming XD
congrats for 10 mil subs!
2:39 that laugh ❤
Lol when Ryan meets a person HOWDY!
This series is only valid in the summer
Please visit nepal one time plz 🥺🥺🥺
AYYY BACK AT IT
ryan littery make me happy every single video
That employee was is an npc
@0:24 Is that Zach from YAA?
You never came to Florida either Orlando to be specific
Dude was in New York and zoomed out of South America 🤯🤯🤯
The only thing missing here is McDonald's and Chipotle.
New challenge : one penny for each time he said « HOWDY »
Howdy 🙂☺️
tthis man makes more in a hour than i can in a month
Ryan I’ve gotta hand it to you, you’re entertaining, #1 on trending is very impressive!
I was waiting for this video to come 😀
Anyone else feel like Ryan Trahan needs to do today's wordle?
Gg

You need to make a part to on the 30 day challenge
My guy went from surviving 30 days with an penny to speedrunning it
It’s only been like 3 months but why is there so much nostalgia
Easily the best seed for this run
ryan’s laugh is so contagious
You should do a chain where people should try to beat your speedrun
he really doesn't understand NY 😭😭 if i saw someone running I would start running too bruh he would have scared the shit out of me
congrats on #1 on trending 🙃
this brought back all the great memories of watching this challenge for a month of the summer
This guy can never be broke
Ryan: *when in doubt* "HOWDY"
The person from whom you bought water was Indian
His storytelling ability is so good. He knows how to keep the pace while making it understandable AND funny. Kudos to him
yessirrr new york
Bourne supremacy, howdy edition
Imagine if ryan did a penny challenge around earth
lets gooooo
people are just being nice to the camera
That area looks amazing with all the screens and stuff
I want ten million playbutton unboxing

Ryan is the very definition of "Let your goofy side out".
He made number one on trending worldwide i’m pretty sure I’m probably wrong
howdy 🤠
I’m sitting here screaming “YOU DON’T HAVE TIME TO DO A SPONSORSHIP RYAN!” 😂😂😂
The seed is crazy
Bless the penny gods bless the nickel Gods bless the diam gods bless the quarter gods and bless the dollar gods

at 8:26 यहां पर तो टेप था यह रहा
His storytelling ability is so good. He knows how to keep the pace while making it understandable AND funny. Kudos to him
I m glad someone else has my weird honking and wheezing laugh. I always feel weird about it
Why does it feel like the ending is pointing towards a possible crossing the world with one penny 🤨
I think we all deserve an unedited video of this
ryan is da man
Video idea: I traveled the world using 1 penny
why do you say shoot in rps Its rock paper scissors not rock paper scissors shoot
at 3:35 pagal ho tum waha india wow
Mad respect to that cameraman 👑
I have so much admiration for how easily he makes friends with strangers
Ryan is without a doubt, one of the most polite people I’ve ever seen.
I wish I was a tall and handsome as Ryan is
Ryan, do you enjoy fruit
By now Ryan has said "HOWDY" to almost every person in the world
Pretty pog.
Number 1 on trending!

How are you still popular???
Happy birthday for last week 🎉

The Indians in the store tho 😂
I wish I had run into you in New York
Honestly the fact that he’s genuinely able to capture someone’s likeness in a 60 second drawing is kind of incredible
This was a great video
I'm tempted to beat this speed run and post it
That was an Indian grocery store in ryan video.... Woahhh

*#1 IN TRENDING??? CONGRATULATIONS!!*
You are brave.
New trend?
Omg this is like the most representable definition of "CAPITALISM" in 15:00 YouTube video.  And I'm here for it, cuz it's entertaining
He still made 20$ an hour   Ain’t nothing wrong with that
Would've bought a water pack
Here we go again!
14:38 it shows dreams face

What’s the seed?
What I have noticed with Ryan is he’s not socially awkward he’s awkwardly social 😂😂
Is that a 1 day speed run I hear?
10$ for a hotdog

Wish you could search the nicest city and try it. NY is the worst lol
Ryan is the most cheerful human I’ve ever encountered
1:23 anyone know who that man is? can you show him this video? 😂
Ryan new dreamm
Ryan u should be grateful  Those guys from which u got the bottles of water were Indian.  Even if u had a dollar less  U simply just had to say "please" one time.  We can't get over the generous nature of ours😅
I love the part when that man said, "Pagal ho kya"
Waiting for the Penny Challenge as a black male in America. Feel like it'd go way differently.
I liked the outro a lot actually.  It’s simple and might be seen as unimportant, but it’s so much more.  It reminds us that even when life is busy and full of commerce lol, we need to take a step back and live in the moment. I’m not sure if it was intentional Ryan, but it was well done!
1 trip to india with just $10
realizing i was in nyc at the same time as ryan
You should do a penny challenge but you can’t use your phone except to get money from cash app. So no ubur eats or anything like that.
What I have noticed with Ryan is he’s not socially awkward he’s awkwardly social 😂😂
Indian in newyork 😂😂😂😂 omg store keeper
I thought Ryan wouldn't get paid for his drawings but it turned out they were really good.
Dang sum 1 on trending

During the penny challenge I would wake up everyday excited to see what Ryan would do that day.
Never pay that much for a GLIZZY 😂😂 I’m from this dump and i never buy glizzys from those dirty vendors! Salute to you for that LOL
I like how he gives the occasional "howdy" to random strangers as he passes
Thank god Ryan is back

The return of the king
Bro i love the penny series its so fun
New York is a grid. Not too hard to navigate.
Can we all just pause and appreciate how Ryan has run out of ideas?
Idk what you mean Ryan those artworks for 60 seconds are some much better than what I do in 30 minutes!
Bro you gone to indian shop. Indian shop is always like that.
Loved the video the zoom out at the end from New York but it zoomed from Africa hahaha
Why do i feel he needs to clear more his throat lmao
Bruh again bruh butd diffrent
so many emotions in 15 min video haha
Actual video title: "I'm running out of ideas"
You should use the iPhone 14 action mode lmao
Ryan Vs Preston Ryan 🏃  Preston 🏃🏃🏃🏃🏃🏃🏃🏃🏃🏃🏃 LOL
Bro just proves you can make 20 bucks an hour without a job
Bruh. I was eating delicious ramen from raki raki and this video at the start made me eat faster and faster.

Ryan lost 7 cents on attempts making this video
Should’ve brought arrack in the video
If he had lost his penny. He could've still made it all the way to mrbeast or Bahamas even. lol

You guys should’ve turned on action mode on a iPhone 14 wile recording the running 😂
We all know for a fact that this man LITERALLY has NO HATERS ❤❤❤

Major time loss at the water buying section, so that speed-run was probably a few dollars of the world record.
Wow fun?

Surviving in new york city with one penny for 30 days
Petition for "Can't hold us" to become Ryan's outro music 👇
I dare you to do that in Canada. LOL we don’t use pennies anymore so you’d flop
Without camera it’s very hard
Man that shopkeepers are  indian  Probably i should also open a shop in New York.
He could have just gotten a job and made more.
I delivered groceries on a bike w a trailer through lower Manhattan up to around Times Square all summer...I still don't know how I did it
No offense but Dylan could definitely afford to give something. 🙄
10$ for the hotdog wow
You stepped into my state! ❤

10$ for a hotdog????  What the hell?
Bro my name is Ryan
“If you don’t like it slap me on the face… I’m just kidding please” 😂😂😂 I love how Ryan is the most extroverted introvert.  He literally says the anxiety out loud when he makes a joke.
9,513rd person
am I the only one that saw the spider man in the background
Work place drama was insane 😭
What was the outro for man are you gonna use a penny to build a rocket???

Ryan this vid is #1 on trending        Congrats!!!! I've been ur fan since 2mil
Love what u do man
Using a penny to get across the world in 3 months
The RNG on this run was IN-SANE.
Ryan should just do the 60 second caricatures for fun videos
I have the exact same sketch book you got
There should be more irl speedruns
More of this
Ryan can do anything possible
I could not stop laughing the whole time
Alright I think Ryan is going to do the penny challenge for a year now and travel around the world 😂
howdy
Yay
Yay
Yay
Yay
what did those shirts say?
2:39 I CANT XDDDD
Amazing video
#1 trending that's crazy, nice job ryan
i think u can do something else with the penny series where u host another YouTubed for charity and clout or random ppl to do it to change their life
12:05 im gonna do both of u guys in 60 seconds -Ryant Trahan 2022         AYO DAT WAS SUS -_-
Dylan was so unsure 🤣
Do another penny series
captions are W, "haHgh-"
🥳
The camera man running as much with you
3:38 is he Indian shopkeeper said are tum pagal ho kya
Congratulations you are #1 trending
W
If I have chance and I would go and slap that shop owner. He don't know how to talk a lady
the random “howdy” to strangers always get me
ahh s*** here we go again
You should do this in Idaho it would be way harder
You’ve said howdy so many times you would be the best actor to play flowey the flower
can we get a "howdy" count!🤣😂
Is Ryan gonna travel the world with just a penny next but just imagine a 50 day with a penny traveling earth
He guy called her stupid
I think the earth is saying he’s gonna travel across the earth using one penny!!!!
Holy shid, #1 on trending congrats man!
#1 on trending!! Woot woot!!! 🎉 congrats Ryan! Or should I say, Howdy 🤠
I love your videos
Dream speechless
all i want to know is what wasvthe dudes shirt at 9 min in
Jesus loves you all and don’t say the Lords name in vain
Ryan definitely gonna go down as one of those goated youtubers
I am in Times Square watching this and I’m going to go to the dollar store to see workplace drama
Bro I just got back from my trip to NYC and now I realized that I could have met you there. I’m beyond mad rn and I want to punch something. To think that I would meet my favorite YouTuber and I just missed that is like slap in the face. Omg I just needed to let this anger out and Thankyou for letting me. Aaaaaaaaaaaah
Glad to see Ryan back!
I like HUH he walks up to someone and says do you have a pen turns around and ask selling pen for 1 dollar BRUH
Penny speedrun in every state
Statue of liberty guy in the background and that cool 3d realistic billboard at the end. Neat! Great video Ryan loved it as always!!!
Hey man don’t forget to pray and remember jesus loves you he died on the cross for you repent  if you don’t know how to search it up like this how can I repent how can I be save by God. Make sure to have faith in him and trust him and have a relationship with him<333
i did the penny challenge and made $400 in a day
you should try surviving in da hood with a penny
13:28 spiderman near the timer
This dude sounds like he's having the time of his life lmao
His laugh while he was running killed me 💀💀💀
Bro, W cameraman fr, his just running with Ryan.
🔥 # Trending no 1
So wholesome at the end
Ryan. If you’re ever in midtown again, you can always ask  me for $20😂  And navigation through Manhattan is crazy. May the odds be ever in your favor. lol
The fact he got $19 in 16 minutes just from caricatures is insane, some people could only dream of getting $19 per hour.
yo is that intro and ending a hint of ryan going to space???
Translation for 99c store conversation : *drama
What is the song call in the beginning
YESSIRRR! 🔥 🔥
During the caricatures, how was there an Eddy AND a Brett within like a minute of each other? That's hilarious, 2set fans will know 😏
HOWDY
Ryan your a genius for YouTube content
Hi
#1 on trending   congrats Ryan
numer 1 on trendig really we wanna see a penny to the part of alaska thats near russia
What if you did a penny challenge across every continent
skill increase cringe 100
"hagHh" howdy.. "hahH" "haGh" 'hehehhe' - Ryan
Abraham would be proud
As a New Yorker, you’re the only tourist we will tolerate ☺️
Why did he run so far to have to sell water bottles shouldn't have started as soon as he got out the door or at least out of sight of the store owners he bought them from? Kind of overhyped
You need to do another penny series or something everyone loved it and was just sitting up waiting for your video to come out every day
we not going to talk about how Airrack is in the beginning  of the video!?! COME ON HES EATING PIZZA
(insert cimatic hit)
Howdy 🤠
Hhgghgh Howdy hi Hhghhghgh Howdy
God dam 20$ in 10 minutes I might start doin some caricature shit man god dayum
Only problem, people aren’t as nice in NYC as in the music capitol
bro really said "lets do it fast"
Where are your veggies Ryan!?!? Doctor Mike is crying 😢.
dying over ryan saying howdy to everyone he sees
Is the ending of the video foreshadowing for travelling across the world with a penny?
I live in new york and im also American
I’m in ny not nyc
Ehhh your good lol
Finally this cannot waste my time
Bro that Indian guy looked mad as hell ..the only thing i understood was 'Pagal' 😂
That (maybe Indian) guy: are pagal ho gaye ho kya😂 Btw I was at first angry at him.
👍
I love the penny challenge it’s so entertaining
am i the only one that say the spiderman in the backround at 13:28 ???
6:12 I remember this exactly😂
Howdy
I bet next penny challenge is going to be “I crossed the world with only $0.01”
its more impressive how many friends he makes doing these challenges
His little "HeHeHe" while running to the discount store is why he has 10.7 million subscribers.
The cameraman is goated
I miss the McDonald ice coffee was hoping for a cameo in here lol 😂 great video man!!
It was bright as hell at the start and night time at the end This dude counted to an hour like Frieza counted to 5 minutes on Namek 😂
I know the exact spot your in
ayo i was there today and i actually saw u xD u were sprinting like crazy bro i was laughing so hard
I love this videos😊
you should do a penny series but with a bigger distance, like maybe getting home from another continent
Do europe
This guy lives Making Money Simulator
I’ve been on my death bed ever since the series ended. I have magically healed, and I’m happier than I’ve ever been, I don’t have depression or insomnia, or even anxiety now. I’ve been amazing cured.
that ending came like a car crash
He got 2 dollars bought more water and sold it for 2 dollars
Every time Ryan gets nervous he says howdy
Great videos still getting trending each time
POV mean when they were all counting: 1098765432111 on one
Not again
Great video , great content! 💯❤️
8:37 it’s a duck 😮😊
can you possibly release a stabilized version
Starting with 1 penny to cross the world
The dollar discount do be lookin like a backrooms level💀💀💀👽💀👽💀💀
4:38  Citi?
Who's hungry? 👋
Ryan irl speed run > dream Minecraft speed run
Those sketches are worth $$&
Like those subtitles ‘Pen girls laughing’
I was in the background
Do the caricatures challenge on Wall Street grab some bulls by your side..
Those 10 minutes of Ryan drawing caricatures are more entertaining and filled with more drama than the entirety of the Rings of Power TV show.
lol
I love New York GO JETS GO METS GO KNICKS BUT MOSTLY GO JETS!!!!
m
If you didnt waste time selling the pen you could of got paper napkins at a restaurant for free and did the character sketches for almost a hour straight. Well done though. Very Entertaining
ho my i dint wachte but sperdrun that is isane
W
😊 this is actually basically just a faster version of what I had to watch
2024: I traveled Across the earth in 2 minutes with $0.01
Let's goooo more!! I LOVE UR VIDEOS
Does not miss
Can you go to Michigan Please
His awkward laugh make me feel cringe & love in the same time
The penny challenge has to be the best series in the whole youtube  Like if you agree
I Used To Live In New York

Ryan in 2049: today we will be doing 30 days being pikachu

INSANLEY EARLY
Man New York City with DOUBLE ELEVATOR DOORS. WHY ARE THEY INSIDE EACHOTHER.
Thank you Ryan. We need what you do, always.
Ryan did u just pay $10 for a hotdog. We dont say glizzys. But that guy knew u was from out of town and jipped you. That was the ny experience of this all
he's back at it again holy crap!
I swear I love this guy omg ❤
🤩😃
I dare you to drive across the country and top your gas tank off at every single gas station you pass even if you just got gas a mile down the road.
You should do a Penny challenge Manhunt
Isn’t It Crazy How this Has 2.2 mil And #1 On Trending in 10 Hours🤣 Ryan is Doing it For the Views lol
There's no one that could pull off something like this better than the one and only, Ryan Trahan. The Penny God!
Oh no this innocent southern boy is trying to sell things in time square…as a New Yorker I apologize in advance but your friendliness isn’t as effective here 😂
12:09 bad bunny
NYC is difficult place to get people's attention, so I'm impressed that Ryan made it as far as he did!!
Go up to the One World Trade Center
Like if Ryan is the goat
Ryan: Howdy Me watching this on the day it comes out: Wordle reference
DO A SPEEDRUN IN LEBENON KENTUCKY AND BRAFORDVILLE KENTUCKY
Happy late birthday ryan
Hi, i wanna get reply...
Ryan train
Bro is going to be the next Mrbeast with 2 mil Views in an hour and 1# on trending
imagine penny challenge around the world
This 1 penny series is amazing. Ryan WE NEED MORE
when counting down people in the background were probably wondering what the heck these wackos are doin
How did he get so big on YouTube all of a sudden?
The ending though. I was like “Oh, that’s beautiful…”, then VWRRRP
can someone please do a howdy counter
That Shop was of Indian Guys Cause I Understood Them 3:35
Here before the bots…or am I too late
Did he just pay $10 dollars for a hotdog
POV: trading in blox fruits
Ryan is the king of the penny
all waters in thailand are always 10 baht or 0.27 dollars
Ryan in 2060: *speedrunning the new york city challenge*
one howdy, can change the world forever..
At the start was that Jidion?
Ryan you could get people to pay you to make a backstory about them as if they were in an action drama horror movie for a penny challenge because a lot of people like that for their self esteem
10 hours 2.2 million views i am new youtuber give me only 10%views
This is like minecraft speedruns irl, you need the perfect seed.
Ngl little repetitive but still entertaining
#1 on trending again good job Ryan
Let someone who is not famous try this challenge and see them either struggle or fail!!
POV: Me MOM CAN I HAVE A PENNY!😏
Pov I'm not letting the excitement get to me 2 second later mehehehehe
Ryan loves the Glizzys
3:38 man called the register lady an idiot
Bruu  this seed so lucky              A joke
I think he got hit by the great reset the first 6 attempts, that’s why he couldn’t show them 😂
the last part, bro I didn't know that NYC was in south America
Your laugh made me laugh so hard 2:35
Ryan can become millionair in just 2 week
Good to see Ryan got a camera man
Now he needs to do a random seed glitchless speedrun of the penny challenge

The most impressive thing in this video is those 60 second caricatures… damn where can I buy me some of those
Slow down and... *Zooms out of Colombia*
HES BACKKKKK
Why did it zoom out of South America at the end 💀
"this is the craziest workplace drama ive seen" (try guys falling apart this month)
holy shiz did this man pay 10 DOLLARS for a hotdog? inflation be hitting hard lol
Bro that NPC location/movement RNG thouh...
I used to live in the apartment building that he delivered the subway to 😳
20,60$ an hour??????
summoning salt might cover his first irl speedrun topic if this ends up being an official speedrun
The next video is gonna be him speedruning the 0.01 challenge in 5 minutes
Do it in different countries it will be much harder 😂  I personally recommend you to do it in Bangladesh 😂
Ryan is the goat
All that cross country really paid off when you needed to run through NYC 😂
15:22 what do you mean? What do you mean by this??
Ryan hacked the system🥸
Wow
Ryan the 0.01 champion
I love how the globe zooms out of Central America at the end of the video. ;)  Hey... you made (gross) $30+!  I think that's pretty cool.
These runescape graphics are wildly different. The grand exchange doesn't look the same at all!
I noticed a spider man in the background when he's drawing brett
Living in New York and hearing bro say howdy to everyone is the funniest thing
I made 10 bucks in a day by selling lemons that fell off a tree and then buying eggs and selling them
10 dollar hot dog is crazy
Ryan just burnt off all the ice coffees he had during the 30 days
Next 1 penny challenge get enough money to go to Europe
6:50 RYAN US New Yorker DONT SAY “I want a glizzy
ryan put something on that glizzy damn
Unrelated but Ryan's handwriting is so nice and neat?? Like man, mine looks like chicken scratch compared to his 🤣🤣
why is arrack in the first 15 seconds?
I love how he just owns his friendly awkwardness.
New york gonna get flooded very Soon in a few years
Indrecible video!
4:02 come to india my boi
Very chaotic video, but I like it.
Wow
That shop guy is indian
.
Nice
Nice
10:13 You know what they say scared money don't make money
This is so enjoyable because he's so energetic and so entertaining! Keep up the amazing work ryan!
you are a glizzy gobler
Bro you took so long
Imagine just living your day to day life in New York and Ryan comes along for 3 seconds on a bike   "Howdy"
bro finally got a good seed
If Ryan gonna do a penny challenge all over the world I'll respect that
Is no one going to talk about how the girl ryan gave the sign too at 13:05 started taking pictures with it 😂
ima be honest this speed run is crazy 😭 nyc is always packed especially in manhattan so the way you just ran through is crazy
Ryan plz go Malaysia
Record time sheesh
15:15 $10?? What the hell bruh even there you can get a hotdog for way cheaper 😭😭
First it was 3 days And then a week Then a month And now, an hour?
YES
The penny is back for revenge
Ryan speedrunning what he does best
Penny: We meet again
I'm so satisfied about to watching this daily videos. Ryan has a good talent that we knows the things he had ever been. In this challenge, it changes everything in my life style. Owh Mate, You're awesome !
happy last birthday it was also my birthday.
The SHEER CONFIDENCE this man has is astounding
Good job 👍
Why does the thumbnail look like free guy, starring ryan reynolds? Hold on….. RYAN REYNOLDS AND RYAN TRAHAN! They better colab like this thumbnail looks just like the movie.
The Moment I Realised He Is Invincible And Can Do Anything, Because He Survived Off Of McDonald's For 30 DAYS!: 😳
The one penny movie
Love your energy Ryan ❤
Dream running music intensifies
Bro just tried to speedrun capitalism   How to America in 2022 101
Gonna be honest his caricatures are pretty bad, (really good for 60 seconds, but when you advertise something like that, they were probably expecting to be amazed) but he's really selling experiences
Number one on trending! Congrats!
Remember when Preston first met Ryan in the “which one is the imposter” Now Preston is Ryan’s camera man! 👨🏻 🎥
If you stopped breathing, you could save an extra 1.420 second.
1# Trending Wooooo
Hello ❤
Oh my god I can’t believe that you Calab with Abraham Lincoln 7 times
Bros number 1 on trending in 9 hours
Ryan probably made a lot of money from views on this video which would count too, right.
Dude who said Florida is lit it’s not lit at all Florida had to many a-holes down there Hawaii is the best state in America
Bro you ran by the hotel I stayed at on 2:42 of the video
the better name for the video is “SPEEDRUN $0.01 CHALLENGE! (NEW YORK) (ALMOST DIED) (WR!)”
Te amo RASHAN
Wait im decently fast and good at drawing guess ill be doing caricatures after o drop off college
It was am amazing series
3:40 Those people are so mean.  They just insulted each other.
Hes creating another trend
He really ran out of ideas😂
The editor with the subtitles tho lol. whenever Ryan runs the subtitles go "panting for breath", "HEHEHEH", "chuckles"
how about $1000 to one penny speedrun
Howdy 😂
My boi ryan
Lets get this to some likes .,.
Did anyone else notice the 3D commercial at 2 minutes and 13 seconds?
Missed an opportunity to use the dream speed run music
YES
his laugh is so annoying
Great stuff! I love the hustle!
He’s so awkward helppp
Can you do a challenge where you do these charicatures for like several hours and… some spin like giving the money you make to the person with the best story? Just spitballin here
As a new yorker Ryan is already getting the new Yorker jeans.
He made over minimum wage at least
First 10 seconds yeah you did
random dude taking photo of ryan while he is drawing lol
Ryan playing dlc after finishing main mission
do more of new York
Yo when I was getting on the bus I swear I saw u getting off the train I was sooo happy
I feel like this could be optimized A TON
It’s not a true 1 cent challenge because he started off with a cellphone and his unmatched charisma
The amount of good rng that was in this run is insane, You are one lucky speedrunner.
Someone else do this and try to compete with ryan😀
We need another penny challenge
w vid
You 2060x your net worth in an hour. Look at it that way
Ronaldo
Good job ryan
Ryan: dashing through New York   everyone around him: ??? :/ 😅
I really like this penny challenge vids❤️
Maybe you should do this penny challenge in every country, I'm not sure how long it will take though
these videos are so wholesome
nice
He made a woman dream face reveal face
I remembered his Howdy Merch now i feel like its marketing :) [this is a joke pls don't kill me] [ i mean im already dead but ye]
Bro you made 20 an hour that more than minimum wage
It is going in the penny series right now
I watched so many shows and YouTube videos at this point, that I’m making a guess that Ryan is thinking of doing a world version of the penny challenge. Like Hawaii to Australia 👀   Source: using earth at the end of the video
ryan you deserve 100m subscribers and your gonna do it
This would've been perfect with dream speedrun music
wouldn’t have gotten anywhere with the pen for a dollar
Thanks!
Water bottle cashier was like ' pagal ho tum 😂😂' that means r u crazy 😂😂
Anyone else notice todays wordle is “Howdy”
I live there~
WOAH UR #1 TRENDING
We need a counter on how many times he said howdy
Man you are my fav YouTuber <3 love your vids God bless you everyday 🙏🏼😊
Good Job Ryan
Immpressive
Never forget God loves you and is our lord and savior
Who needs a degree in business and marketing when you have ryan
Why do I feel like he's milking this challenge SO hard?
Cool af 😂❤
bros speedruning life
ok
Bro loves pennys
Ryan is living in a simulation or am I living in a simulation
7,667th comment
The thing is, this is literally impossible for anyone who isn’t some attractive twink… not to mention the fact your huge following makes a difference. You really want to go viral, find some ugly kid Joe to do this and be successful WITHOUT YOU SCRIPTING IT
We need more man. You're great
Its weird seeing Ryan in a place that I have been at
a hot dog for $10.00!!!! yikes
People in the workforce can be so despicable to each other. The owner or manager of the dollar store calls her crazy for a simple mistake.  Gotta love good ol American capitalism. Then, after the water is sold he's still talking crap to her.
Hi
Being honest you didnt really get anywhere lol, but you got alot farther than i could have.
If only i was in timesquare at that time
Tax on water?  that's some  bull.
Bro, I don't know what you are. But, Inspiring....!
3:35 indian here  thu logo pagel welp he called her dumb or stuped for the price lmao
Why do u keep saying howdy lol and not hi or hay lmao
I love how Ryan has no idea about everything in nyc as someone who grew up and currently lives there.
This was a lot of fun. ☺️
Love how Ryan zoomed out of Africa when hes in New York
I’m the reason this has 1000000 views 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Please stop sayin howdy I get so annoyed by it
Bros got the best seed☠️👍
I love this series
that hotdog was probably the best
This penny challenge is cool ❤ who else thinks so?
his little "oh okay! " is adorable 😭🥺❤️
no way he completed a whole life simulation speed run.
Ryan would be a great salesmen.
In newyork at moment
.
The guys on #1 trending lets gooooooooo
His laugh made my day
do you get déjà vu? 👹👀
If you do this series again a concept could be the exact same thing, but you’re not allowed to go to the cities you went to last time
Can I just point out that using his phone undermines the integrity of this challenge
Next Video:  I traveled across the earth in 1 month on $0.01
Sup
Ryan's energy is out of this world, we love to see it
5:06 POV: you are taking a dump
Ryan: I’m selling a pen for a dollar  Random person: no  Ryan: Imagine 😂
Lmao, he can’t use the same seed every time that’s cheaper, he needs made a new random seed every time
10$ for a new york style hot dog.. I could get a drink + hot dog for 1.50$ at costco, damn..
e
Trending number 1 nice.
Dylan didn’t pay you 😭
Have you ever tried to do the penny challenge in Wisconsin
Did anyon elese see Airrack in the vid
U did not just buy a $10 hot dog Ryan 😮
Howdy 🤠
Ryan’s videos are so fun to watch
Anyones else think that Airrack was gonna make an other cameo in the video
Just noticed Ryan sounds like Patrick Bateman when being social
“Water 💦”
that outro had me gone asf lol, gave me chills
People say gas prices are high but 10 dolors for a hotdog
LESS GOOOOOOOOOOOO!!”!
SAME LAST NAME. SUBSCRIBED!!!
The last one looked like dream
I think this is the best day of my life I have been waiting for him to post a new penny series video Ryan 🎉 you’re amazing
Spider man 13:28
#1 on trending. ryan is so cool
Bro had a good seed
It takes an hour to get paid in full through uber eats.
🪥
......... nickle challenge in Canada?
The amount of times he says howdy
Imagine a dude on a bike going 30 miles per hour saying “I want a gillezy “ and saying “howdy” to every person he say IN NEW YORK
lol im from san Antonio aswell 😂 😂
I know Hindi and that shopkeeper was really mad at the lady and then he asked her the how the hell did u charge him 75 cents 😂
NEW YORK? woahh! So cool man great content
What’s the seed?
Now I wonder, How many pens has Ryan stolen from innocent people?
LMAO
3:38 they were Indians
You reveled your secret, 9:59
don't milk it
*Speedrun Not speedran
I binge watched all of the penny challenges you did
Mugger: *tries to mug Ryan Ryan: *Howdy!*
I am speed-running this video right now
IRS: Time to collect
Not verifiable, obviously edited and cut video.
Ryans confidence is the biggest thing ever
I miss the iconic theme song in the beginning>~<
ayo 1Mill
I think you earned your penny back
14:38 looks like dream
Welcome to New York City
You should do it but in England
He was speaking hindi lol
This guy is something else XD
next he’s gonna speedrun buying a house from one penny
Seeing Ryan talking to people and being social, me sitting in my bed wishing I had that confidence 😅
A penny across the whole world challenge... gives himself half a year to do so
#1 on trending! Congratulations!
bro i was in new york on the 8
E
That pen is probably worth more than a dollar from him
Anyone knows what's a perry
E
Is 10 dollars a lot for a hotdog?
This is a masterpiece.
ryan that thumbnail is literally a masterpiece
That was in winter
Katie is the goat
Next do Hawaii it’s really expensive here plus I’ll hopefully run into you
20 dollars an hour is more than what I make
just nuts
Just so you know the talking wasn’t drama they talk In urdu it’s my language but there was no drama
Gosh darn it, now he's gonna do a one penny challenge around the world
Da king is back with Penny!
but like- the cameraman is so athletic...
Where are your parents ❤️ 1.👩👦 2.👩🏠_______👦🏠 3.👩⚰️ 4.⚰️👦 5.⚰️⚰️
Yoooo #1 on trending? LETS GO RYAN
I felt the embarrassment/awkwardness when the dude said "right here dude"
I’ve lived in nyc my whole life so Ryan + New York was rlly funny to me he’s so out of place I love it lmao
Mad glizziez, you could never
RIP cameraman fr😂😂😂
Maybe you could do this on another continent?
They say: The myth of Ryan Trahan is that if you ask to be pinned and say 1¢ your wishes will be granted.  Ryan Trahan! Can I be pinned "1¢"
What was that ending
Bro met the entire I-35 corridor
"Pagal"😂😂
Freaking use an iPhone 14 Pro with Action Mode on! Lol great video though
come from away
Most definitely we want more content like this❤️ watching all the way from South Africa 🇿🇦
Ryan has literally become my favorite person ever
Now you have to go from top to bottom of the Country
What
How many times he said howdy
Yo
I have been to New York City it is so big
2:38
Imagine having Ryan Trahan deliver your meal
the end gave me a jumpscare
The ending made me smile omg 😭Ryan never fails to make wholesome content
Ryan is the most cheerful human I’ve ever encountered
Was that a $10 hotdog?
it makes total sense that the craziest workplace drama happened at a place with indian workers 😭 (i’m indian btw and we’re dramatic as hell)
mate get hit by a car then sue them. ez money
you should have done delaware
If ur ever in London try this! You’ll make - pounds I think 😂 it’s like super hard mode
7:57 “Have a nice day 😊!” “okay😐”
nostalgic...
Today’s Wordle answer is Howdy
If you believe in it, you will end up believing it 🤞🍀
Massachusetts
Ever day after the 30th day of his penny change buy he dint upload for a while
Imagine he does a "00.1. Penny Challenge Around The World"
Which subway tho
uhm I think you gotta fix SpeedRan change the a to u
What’s next?
I really miss his 30days penny challenge. Now I have nothing to watch at night.
New Yorkers are No-Nonsense, there are enough performers already asking for tips. You did phenominal by New York standards
You should do this in multiple cities and see which one gives you the most money
Mate didn't do the no clip glitch, he was on record pace before then
I have watched several videos of you doing this. I challenge you to not mention to people that you are doing a challenge. Do not mention that you are trying to make as much money as possible in 1 hour. It seems to become more of a novelty for people to help you out.
I counted AT LEAST 14 Furrys in the background 😂 btw great video 👍🏿
He's not only speedrunning $0.01 in an hour he's also changing lives 😂
Brooo when were you in New York 😭I would’ve loved to have met you man
After the countdown in the end, the "for what" made me giggle and the " i don't know" by Ryan made me laugh out loud😂😂
Omg we are at third place on trending keep it up guys
Legend has it that that girl carry’s 10 pens everywhere she goes😂
Feels like a Spider-Man pov movie
Anybody else see the dude dressed as the statue of liberty at 15:19
Nice video
The problem is you did not have a kid named Tommy run up to him and hand him twenty bucks
wsg
Sadly he did not get any McDonald’s so sad!
HES GONNA GO AROUND THE WORLD FROM A PENNY IM CALLING IT RYAN THE OUTRO SAYS TOO MUCH
I love his little watermark lol 😂
There should have been a howdy counter 😂
I live in NYC
Nearly 2 mill views on 8 hours, get it I guess 💪🏼💅 xxxxxx
First
HEY GUYS TODAY IM SURVIVING WITH JUST ONE PENNY IN THE ENTIRE KNOWN UNIVERSE
His editor editing this video” a sh*t here we go again”
Wait you paid half ur net worth of the day on one glizzy with no toppings
Imagine how many sponsorships he did before he got this final attempt
Tenna for a hot dog  😭
Dude I wish to have social skills like Ryan one day lol
agreed!
🥳
I love Ryan’s videos keep up the good work
You should try this in a different country
good video as always, but PLEASE let the penny challenge go ryan😭
😀
Editing is fire
I saw you in New York when you were filming this. Love your videos!
can we all appreciate the camera man for doing the Speedrun bit?😂
I think we need a "Howdy" counter for EVERY single one of Ryan's videos XD
Bro speedruning capitalism
MORE MORE MORE MORE
GO FIND AXEL!!!!
He still got ptsd from summer
ryan you are top dog fr
Dang bro this reminds of making up every day in June to the new Ryan Trahan video
can you do  living with a penny and trying to get to another country in two months
can we legit have a "HUGAH" counter here😂😂
"I travelled around the world with $0.01" I CAN SEE IT COMING SOON! IF RYAN DID THIS, IT WOULD BE INSANE
I thought bro was gonna get a house in 60 mins lmao
this is awsome!
props to the camera man
1.5 million views in 7 hours. crazy bro. keep it up
E
YES
You are literally the most polite and pure person out there to everyone you meet or pass. It’s so lovely to see. There needs to be so many more Ryan’s in this world 🙏🏼
You should go to different cities and do this
Are you still eating your vegetables
Ryan and a penny is the greatest dynamic duo of all time
i recommend buying the iphone 14 pro to film this thing called action mode is crazy smooth
You know whats still missing? The veggies on the hotdog
Welcome back ice coffee man
Yeoo that’s me and gio
You need to make the next penny video in denmark :>
WOAAAH U ARE AT IT AGAIN WOOOOOOOO
He is only doing it because he get a lot of money last time that why he doing it
Imagine if he’s doing this because he actually only has 1 cent in his bank account
Or self portrait.
10 dollars for a hotdog?
It's not "Chariacter's"  It is Characters
What is with the earth graphics??? are you going to space?? Travel to the moon off of 1 penny XD love ur vids!!!
He can’t be an introvert
I mean hey, you made over minimum wage.
The store worker, if anyone wants to know said, "You are crazy"
the caricatures have gotten so much better since last time love the vids, and that there is no cussing
Ryan stressing Also Ryan: Hey. Howdy 😂😂
I learned to ride a bike on a city bike in New York City when I was 14
My dude says “Howdy” to everyone  🤣😂🤣😂
Bro got some lore going on at the end
why does Ryan use the same method to make money? He sold a pen for a dollar and makes money from there.
Weesswwq
This video was great
Lol
I love Ryan. He’s so relatable and it’s nice to have a YouTuber that isn’t scared of being social and being out there, showing his audience you don’t have to put on an act to make good content ❤😄👍
title: I speedran the 0.0- CLICKS ON VID
nicoles chin looked like glenn quagmire
Next Video: Speedrunning from a penny to a trip to space
haha comment made sunday october 9 2022 2:20 pm pacific time
Indians
Here's an idea how about coming to Norwalk  ct ...... please man i need you to be my first person to give me a autograph. Also for your safety wearing  i luv ny on something can cause scammers and robbers to make you a target.
Imagine having Ryan deliver your food to your front door. You are awesome to watch, and we hope you keep being amazing. ❤
Yo Ryan I just realized that I have the same grey "I love New York" hoodie! Twins lol!
Nicole's sketch looks like dream
we learn from him we can start from a penny to like thousands if you were to keep on going
Come to Philadelphia
I love you Ryan!!
Ryan: have a nice day  Random stranger: Ok
10 MIL 🎉🎉
Ryan I sat here watching this video thinking what I should comment and could not come up with anything. So im jut gonna say hi, HI!!! YOURE AMAZING HAVE A GREAT DAY!!!!
What if he went from Los angles all the way to Maine with a penny
With respect! But isn’t it cheating to mention that you are on a challenge or making a video 🤔 Gives a bit of an  advantage
Hey... I live in Florida
why does this video feel like I'm watching a video game
ryans next video is gonna be "going to outer space starting from 1 pennie day 1 out of 100"
You are too famous now .. too easy
Honestly the fact that he’s genuinely able to capture someone’s likeness in a 60 second drawing is kind of incredible
Shopkeeper was Indian 😂
yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
That ending 😂
Huh- howdy
7:50 I use that sketch pad at school and I live in New York 😂
Bro just made more than minimum wage 😂
oh no ryan dont do the penny challenge around the world
Do i have school tomorrow at 7:30 and its 2:30 now and i am drinking coffee watching ryan and have i not studied for the exam tomorrow . Yes to all . I got my piorities straight
DUDEEEEEEEEEE you can’t speed run this challenge! It’s weird yo😂
Whats spiderman doing in the back
Why the hell is a hot dog 10 dollars in New York :skull:
i subscribed
that girl at the end kinda look like dream with that jaw
its backkkkkkkkkkkkkk😁
I like Jared he was cool
Part 31
THAT MUCH FOR A HOTDOG???
shouldve gone to new york in the 1 month challenge
fl is cool but living at in it kinda wack
If Ryan was Deliver a penny to a person on the other side of the world he would succeed on foot
Penny challenge in Europe hmmmm?🤔
You should do a video series testing the top 100 money making methods to see which is easiest to start and most profitable.
m
ryan is the most likeable 6 foot 3 man in the world.
Because of that ending, I am just convinced that Ryan is in South America and not NYC
Where’s dreams speedrun music
this would be really interesting to see done in other countries when you get there
I'm giving a preview estimate of $23.74
Imagine travelling around the world with just 0.01, that would be interesting
Bro really went mmhmmEHEEHEHEEHEEHH 😂😂
Howdy
Fun Fact: Yesterday the wordle was howdy, Ryan’s favourite word
😂what
Bro's got Dream level speedrunning luck
I’m still freaked out by that last shot 😳
As somebody who spent a lot of time in New York, I can confirm Ryan Trahan is the only person who says Hi to randoms. Most people in New York are pretty rude, not all but most.
Wait how did you get back
moral: more money to earn means more investment
He finally uploaded
imagine how embarrassed the worker must've been 3:30
What is up with this dude and penny challenges 😂
who else noticed he said howdy like 50times
How many times Ryan said howdy. ⬇️
$20 dollars an hour? not bad
im sorry, 10 dollars for a hotdog?
That zoom out at the end... around the world in 80 days using just a penny?
I love Ryan's penny challenges! Amazing content and only Ryan can make it so funny and wholesome at the same time! Dang Ryan might be just better than Dream in speedrunning 😂
Ryan in 2050: “trading this penny to buy the sun”
"pen girls laughing" 💀
You should do series of this survive like week or whatever you want
cool
Howdy When you meet a new person your dreams are unlocking a new character
The Indian store drama is so top notch😂
The Indian guy said  Thosee pagal haga That means are you crazy
Ah heck nahh, 10 dollar hot dog 💀💀💀💀
$20/hr money making method
Ryan - you try these challenges all the time, why not really challenge yourself, goal $100k. must visit every major city.
Here's an Idea  cross the world in 1 year with a penny    Jk but would be nice
Wow he was actually in west africa, these plot twists are hitting different!
bro was in west africa according to the ending 💀
Who else loved his energy today
i loved how when he zoomed out, he zoomed out of south america
I love how he's yelling "WHERE IS THE SUBWAY??" in the one of the only places where that means two things.
13:27 IS THAT SPIDER MAN IN THE BACKGROUND!!
I like how they sped up the last 10 second on the clock to match with how fast they were going.
I Love your vids
When Ryan runs into the same person he's basically redoing sidequests in video game trying to get a better score 💀
I swear these videos get better and better
Ok but like.. 2:36 was such a fun laugh XD Love it. . . . . . Side note:  I loved this, this was such a fun video to watch. Great job Ryan :)
12:05 that's what she said 😂
YEEES PENNY CHALLENGE WOOOHO 😂
I guarantee that  5 years:TRAVELING ACROSS UEROPE WITH A PENNY 10 year: TRAVILING ACROSS THE WORLD WITH A PENNY 100 years: TRAVILING ACROSS THE SOLAR SYSTEM WITH A PENNY
At 2:50 what was Ryan looking at 🤨
“howdy” -ryan (every single video)
What was that at the end? with the whole Earth
I love this vid your awesome for always getting us entertained
I can’t count how many times he said HOWDY
:/
The whole video I thought he was traveling across America so I was waiting for someone giving him a plane ticket
This is like a spin-off of the penny series
Bros seed was cracked
I pray for everyone who reads this that whatever they are going through gets better, whatever they are suffering with or worrying about will be okay, and that everyone has a wonderful day.❤
Howdy
Penny challenge across the world???
lmao
He still makes more than me per hour.
Hello
😂😂
I love this guys hopfully he let's to 100Mil within 2 to 3 years
Who else saw arriack
New York looks like chicago literally
You know when someone is not from the city, by using the word howdy 1000 times
this gives the vibe of the good times
CLIFFHANGER?!?!?!?!?!?
Rayan videos does bring a smile to my face 🥺🥺❣️❣️❣️
Hear me out traveling around the world in one year with one penny
Can you give me the seed?
There are two sides to YouTube now, one side speedruns spending money and one side speeruns the earning 😂
Dang he must have gotten a really good seed.
“Scared money don’t make money “ Love it
YES THE PENNY SERIES IS BACK OH MY GOD
Where is the song🤬🤬🤬
HOWDY is on wordle today ^^
That outro?
“Why do i bite my nails” literally me
The worker in the first shop was calling the girl dumb and things like that lol
No one : a Ryan : Howdy 😉😁
Bros filming like 3 blocks from my apartment
You should try this challenge in the UK
😮
You should do this in London, now that will be awesome
You should cross the world doing it.
how many times did he say ‘howdy’
Maybe 10h or 24h next? 😅
I live in New York-
This is not an hour 😂
j
I love when ryan does penny challenges it just makes my day
Ryan’s carrer is gonna be destroyed once the penny gets banned in 2023
Speedrunning character drawing
Keep up the amazing work!
That ending terrified me 🥹
Traveling around the whole world on $0.01 when?
Howdy
How is nobody talking about the 10 DOLLAR HOT DOG DFAQ
This guy is speedrunning my savings.
Hey! I was in the starting place in lego marvel super heros
Alternative title: "The penny challenge Any% glitchless no cheats (world record)"
Pancakes better than waffles  \/
The store he is going is an Indian store because they are speaking Indian and I am Nepali this is so nice .
How cool would it be if Ryan did this challenge in other big cities from other countries, other than US :)
POV: You were in New York at this time and Ryan Trahan comes up to you Ryan: Excuse me but can i buy a pen for a penny? *saying this whilst panting heavily*
He just spent 10 dollars on a single hotdog
howdy
Penny around the world?
😁
Could've just pickpocketed them in the last few seconds of the speedrun smh
I love you I have been watching you all day
Your videos always make me happy
the ultimate season 2 to the penny challenge
I binged watched his penny series and he is absolutely amazing and funny he’s so nice and I loved your video!👍🤴
I love how he says howdy,sorry for just walking/sorry past people
can pepole activate the grate restet?
W
to be fair, shouting "Where is the subway" in New York City might confuse a lot of people
1 Dollar Challenge in America
This probably made Dream (or Clay) cower in fear
Work a minimum wage job or do this😂
Yoo what's the seed?
Bruh could’ve just bought waters and sold them and then did the caricature 😭 bro would’ve saved 20 min… Ik he wanted variety for content tho
I'm actually impressed with ryans ability to draw multiple people decently while holding up a conversation
Good the challenge is still going
Ryan: This is the craziest night of my life Also Ryan: Howdy!
U are mad crazy all these videos you have made to make money. U prbly have made more money than my ma may and da
Ryan really has a good relationship with pennies.
I have a more difficult challenge. West Virginia is a populated but not crowded place. It may be a little challenging >:)
I need to know who was the cameraman for this
i think geo is spelled "gio" not g . e . o
Yesss
POV Next year: I survived on 1 penny for a year challenge
Ryan’s art skills in 60 seconds are better than mine in an hour  Edit: thx for the likes, I have never had this much
I LOVE U RYAN TRAHAN BIG FAN ANDI LIVE IN NEW YORK🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
7:03 is the best part
1.2M in 5 hrs 🤯 can’t wait to see that 100M sub milestone ❤
Ryan has taught me that you can make money out of anything
lol i'm Indian and I could understand what they were arguing he was saying she's crazy XD
Ryan can u like this PIN ME
i hope ryan does another penny challenge soon, it is super fun to watch and i would love to see it!
Ryan is just... just... howdy
Thank god he didn't born in INDIA.
Wow ryan nice outro very impressive "cheering and clapping 👏 👏 👏
What $10 hot dog you buy 💀💀💀
I liked this how it was in another state of the 50 states you should do this again but instead of a Speedrun you should do it where you travel throughout all 50 states with 1 penny to get to a certain state throughout a certain amount of days?
10 dollars / hour 🔥
Love it
Here we go again
It's kinda ironic how today's wordle is Howdy
penny across north and south america?
Welp, here we go agin folks
4:46
Good job for getting to 10m 🎉
13:28 Spiderman just casually walking
Love the videos, Ryan. Keep it up!!!
T

If dream didn’t face reveal I would of thought it was Ryan from his speed run pro
Me being a nervous reck when talking to smoke this man saying howdy to literally everyone
Bruh the end gave me so much anxiety
bruh
Congratulations on 10M
Wow!
Let's go Ryan
Man, realised how much we all missed Ryan and his crazy money making schemes lol  Good to see you back champ
Bruh  “Water 💦”
7:26 - Cue Subway Surfers Music
20 bucks in 1 hour is more than most starter jobs pay an hour... Maybe we should all do this
i just went to new york
Try to make the 1penny challenge thru europe
eh tum pagal ho 3:37
Ryan did all that hard work for a NY Glizzy
the whole video summary: "howdy 🤠"
He’s laugh 😂
weeeeeeee
10 DOLLARS FOR A DOG FROM A DOG CART?!
Today's Wordle: HOWDY  How did the wordle gods deduce that Ryan would post today?!?! 😳
This man got a God seed for his last speed run
POV when your dad tries to teach you what hard work is😂
Who also just saw this and clicked on it
o
It seems like ever since 24h in the meta verse some of his outro scenes have been setting up some sort of story
How the hell was 3 waters 1.95 bro one Water is 1-2 dollars
You know Ryan has been everywhere when he sees someone in New York that he saw across the country
20 dollars an hour
I’m finally early.will the king that is Ryan trahan reply
Says something very cringe in front of someone **Nervous howdying intensifies**
GREAT video Ryan
Is the World at the end mabye a little teaser for "I crossed the entire World with 1 penny"?
Every like this gets ima do a pushup.
pin me or get shreked
Use this money to buy a good camera stabilizer (those running shots are painful to watch)
3:34  Alia Tum to Pagal ho tum, Hnn *Alia= Name* You are Dumb, Yes (They are speaking Hindi)
Oh no this is going to become a trend😂 rip anyone who dies from this in  some weird way of it just like every other tic tok challenge
this man is gonna take over the world....
Does someone knows how many times did Ryan said howdy😂
Ryan telling himself he hasn't had enough of the 1 penny.  Ryan: I need more!!!  Also Ryan: let's speed run this it's the perfect plan. 👌
Only osc fans will know that is not the og coiny
ryan: "bro is this a npc"  literally everyone: "yes"
Ryan should just learn some coin magic tricks.  "Donation only. Magic tricks" It's way better than begging for free pen, then $1 for a pen, then $2 for water. lol
better than minecraft speedruns
wait wu-
As someone from new york everyone seeing you would think your a weirdo and a tourist
I know the challenge wasn't that far long ago but this still makes me nostalgic for some odd reason.
you zoomed out of South America New York is in North America but I really like your video 🤠
Hes back :)
Random Indian Shop owner 😭
No one noticed Airrack at the start
Ryan, you have become my favourite creator on YouTube. More videos pls.
Bro got a lucky seed
2:38
I was in NYC one time and I love it like you do haha
Love the outro. Sitting in new york, zooms out to reveal he's actually in Colombia
ayo 20 dollars an hour tho
i love this
Col
Those 60 art pieces were actually pre good for 60 seconds
W series
Going to the ice-cream shop??
WHY IS AIRRACK AT THE START?
He's squeezing this challenge for penny he can get
This was both funny and a fun adventure😂… and all for the glizzy😂
howdy
Ryan's working out n jogging against his own will paying off for him lmfao

10 dollars for a hot dog you got scammed
How does Ryan make even New York look nice wow

10 dollar glizzy is wild
Is a glizzy really ten bucks?
The wordle is HOWDY
hello hello
To know that Ryan was near me I’m shocked
Do all your NYC cashiers look like they're straight out of Chernobyl? You people are crazier than ever.
btw im pakistani so ik what they are saying when he was buying water from those workers he was basicly saying "you are stupid what are you doing" this doesnt matter but im just letting you know if u dont know okay bye lol
3:35 the man said that are you dumb
Ryan! I will meet you one day… don’t know what will happen after that yet 😂
That ending makes me think you are going to travel the world Ryan
Bro says “im not broke” and gives nothing 😂
Do a full day In nyc
Ryan should do this in other countries 😱😎
You should do 1c across the world
All I was thinking at the end was  G L I Z Z Y 😂😂😂
Hell yeah... Howdy Ryan 😃

7k comments 😊🎉❤😂
Next video: I have one year to travel the world starting with a penny
I found out that Ryan’s fav word is Howdy
when they were aruging they were speaking urdu i speak urdu and they called her crazy
One day after I rewatched the 30 day series this comes on and I’m like it’s a sign
Why do I believe this is how spiderman makes money when not being a hero😂
$10 for hotdog. Bro. You just got rip off bad lol
This is just a joke but why did you not go to the bank and take a loan
bros in New York but zoomed out from South America? 🧐
bro is that the backrooms 3:58
He had $2.00 dollars at around 55:00 and finished it off at 00:00 with around $20.00 dollars.
ryan never sees to impress us
Next time don’t wear the I love NY shirt. It screams tourist.
watching you have this much fun just makes me happy dude, thank you for that.
1 mil views in 5hrs is amazing
In my country you can get 9 water bottles of 2 liters each from kaufland only for 2 dollars
Yea
20$/hour not bad at all
This was same crazy rng
0:20?????
Whatever I’m unsure what vibe to put out, I always just go for that Ryan Trahan energy.
Buddy went to my state and city and I ain’t even know!
I love Ryan’s vids
Shopkeeper was infian
Ayoo wait… Is he doing one around the WORLD?!?!?!??!😮😱😱😱😱😱
Money isn’t everything
You spelt city wrong
Happy late birthday 😁

Fire ending
You probably lost that shop keeper her job.. or may be life..🤔🤪🤣
He prolly walked pasted millions of nps
We want the outtakes!
minimum wage aint got nothing on him
Wait, 10 dollars for the hot dog ?!
Dream of New York
That was so intense! For a moment I thought my heart stopped beating.
Ryan go brazy
yooo the first subway order is the same building my sister goes to, to get her lashes done thats so dope wish i was out there to meet you
Here are some Snacks to enjoy while watching 🍉🥜🍞🥐🍟🍔🥓🥩🍗🍖🧀🥞🍕🍳🧆🌮🌯🥪🌭🍿🥗🍝🍜🍩🍪🎂
san antoinio gang
You should travel to every state with only a penny
Ryan you shoud try this but in the mn twin citys i think you would have fun with it
Penny challenge across the world when?
Awesome!
1:41 isn’t that Jacob collier
At the end… is it referencing Ryan doing a 100 days in google earth VR, or penny Challange around the world? Both would be sick as.
Talk about that guy dressed up as the statue of liberty at the end!
the 1 penny challenge in the summer, blessed my june. Thank you Ryan, I love you. <3
Just to think if he went to New York, everything would have went different
“OmG hE iS jAyWaLkInG”  goes the us government
If you did that for 3 hours every single day for a year you d make about 22k
I LIVE IN NYYYYYYY
Jacob Collier?
Those shopkeeper  guys  were indian  ,and talking  in hindi.
I love how he says "Howdy" to literally everybody
this man spits in the face of all coins except his little penny
That girl with the pens is making some serious bank now.
bro a 10 dollar hotdog...
you should make a penny plushie      send me one.
13:27 Spidermans in the backround lmao
You should do around the world penny challenge with the wifey.
name one time ryan has NOT said "howdy" in one single video.
that earth ending was dope friend
Ryan in maybe 2 years: I went from a penny, to a million
Bro if it was taking that long you should've changed your seed
How did you get a good trade with the piglins your first try ? I only got dirt and gravel.
oh how I miss the penny challenge
3:33 I speak Hindi and I was laughing so hard cus Ryan was clueless throughout the whole thing
She looks like paranormal activity 😂😂😂😂💀
Can you go to Connecticut for the next vid please
Can u come up with something else instead of penny vids
That zoom out of the world hints at a 1 cent across the world, now we wait.
W
That bottle shop owner is an indian 😀
Why is he actually good at drawing
Eventually, we'll see him go across the world with -1 cent
10 dollars for a hotdog
You could’ve just bought a hammer and bonked ppl in the head and taken their money
1:45 kurtis conner?
Would like to bring something to your notice that the store owner was indian and was speaking hindi and he was actually mad at his employees and saying things like "you dont know how to calculate"
Ryan please makes us another 30 day challenge
Can u send me that seed I might need it
i was gunna say tax in water! hell naw! W owner
Imagine Ryan crossing over the whole world with just one penny
Wish I could have this guys income for a day😂
he should’ve just sold 2 pens
bro's got dream luck
The store owner is really funny. (Funny in a totally Indian way). He is like "ye kya he" (what is this) for the tapes.  I get similar responses from my parents when I couldn't find obvious things. 🤣.  Bro. I love this video. It got some authentic indian flavour 😂🤣🤠
I think that this would not be able to be completed by any other YouTuber Ryan can do this and he is making it funny
What how?
Ryan got a fire seed only 7 resets and he got good rng
Why buy another pen for 1.99 when u could have got one for .1¢ see now you’d have 199 pens for same price and then could have sold pens
IS THIS GONNA BECOME AN OFFICAL SPEED RUN THO??
I’m a fucking fan ♥️
Since I live in NYC, this is pretty cool for me to watch. I love seeing big YouTubers actually notice NYC for a change 😀.
Oof u have to go hours on a plane I got to go one hour in a car👂👁👃👁👂                                                                                                                          👄                                                                                                                      👉   👈                                                                                                                        🦵🦵
LETS GOO NEW YORK!!!!! I live close to new york! :)
Great vids luv u
Bro I respect your confidence
RYANNNNNNNNNNNNNNB LES GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO MAKE MORE PLEASE   I THINK RYAN SHOULD DO THESE SERIES IN OTHER COUNTRIES.. LIike come to India and start from 1rupee
Im not sure if that the end of the video with the earth being shown is a tease for something but i love it.
Bro how are you not awkward in society you are very cool
Can someone tell me in reply what the shop owner in the beginning said to the worker??
do you need an inhaler bro?
1 hot dog in New York is 10 bucks. What the hell. That is expensive.

Finally, seeing a indian guy in your videos.  The water store owner in the beginning . He's like  Are tum pagal ho (are you mad) 🤣🤣

Wait is the ending zooming out to the world a hint of a Penny Series crossing the world 👀??
Bro got the perfect seed
The art was so much fun to watch!
loll
This goat deserves all his subs god bless you rayan and howdy
great intro loved it
I live in NYC so I definitely understand this struggle. I used to sell comedy tickets in time square so definitely understand this battle
The guy who sold you water is Indian or Pakistani I can just tell by looking and how kind they are
Ryan I noticed your art is a masterpiece.Keep up the good content.I was speed running my dinner while I was watching  you speed run.😂
i love that he doesn't care about wasting time. and takes a second to say howdy to everyone his eye lands on
In next video he will probably travel across the world with 0.01💲
Ohhh Ryan my pal…..I was super excited to see a new video and you didn’t disappoint….as always😂❤🎉
Surviving on 1 penny for 100 days
you should release an extended cut where it's actually an hour long
People in the street be like: who is this extremely social person?
Imagine just stand ing and Ryan just runs past you and say "howdy"
For those wondering: $20.60 is 0.000000007923077% of the 2.6 billion dollars in circulation in NYC.
you should try to cross canada with a penny
The thumbnail looks like you on GTA v or something
Jared supports local businesses 🎉
We love you, Ryan
My guy is actually wearing an I ❤️ New York sweater 😭
This is just so relatable and funny to watch! Props to preston and zach on nailing it on this one 🔥💪🏻
3:35 indian guy 😂😂
Ryan: I'm going to take a penny across america Ryan a few months later: I'll fookin do it again

The fact that this shows someone could theoretically make a living like this is really cool!
This is a god seed.
The only thing Ryan is speed running is his Subs😎😎
My name dylan
Hey man good to see you back. I'm actually more interested in what's going on at that workplace drama 😂😂 Seems like they're from India or Pakistan because they're speaking Urdu/hindi..
I’m British and now I know the American penny memorised just from the 1 penny challenge
if this mans don't clear his throat
do a penny challenge where you have to visit every state
Too much workplace drama 😢
Did this guy just pay 10 bucks for a glizzy 💀
9:35 i don't know why but I love that line
I think the end is foreshadowing him doing a penny challenge across the workd
Bro, imagine him going into that discount store 7 times 😂
How many time you are gonna do this
My man went to space for the last bit
Bro I was so engaged with this video that I actually speed ran making a smoothie and drinking it while watching the video unintentionally 😂
I love the part where Ryan said howdy
Hello  Some unfunny guy here to tell you to have a good day.
At 20M or 15M you should cross Europe or something
Hold up 10 bucks for a NYC glizzy
Should go to another country and do this with another currency
Next time you gotta take your caricatures to Columbus Circle, you’d blend right in!
Your penny challenge was so epic. So sad it ended tho
wait 10 bucks for a hot dog?? what..
I was hoping the video was an hour 😢
Woah is this another series?
Drawing skills are rapidly improving
I TRAVELED ACROSS THE WHOLE WORLD IN A MONTH?! ENDING?!
The bottel guy was Indian 😭😭😭😭
Im waitng for going around the world with just one penny
One of my Favorite vids ever no joke favorite my you
Howdy count: 73

You should do the penny challenge but you start where you finished off on the penny challenge then have to make ur way back to the other side of the world and have the great reset and stuff again pls I loved it i need a sequel
I’m surprised i didn’t see a group a guys getting sturdy
That Indian workshop owner was rude
1 mil views in 5 houra
New York is an amazing place. I hope you enjoy the time you spend there
Lol
🙄🤦🏽‍♂️
Did you see Dream’s Face reveal
The Indian (im assuming coz he spoke Hindi) store employ seemed like he wanted to chop his hair off
I feel bad for the camera man having to run
Areee PAGAL HO KYA ? XD
New Yorkers just not it okay 😂😂… I love y’all tho
Idk why but that Indian store owner is the perfect definition of an Asian parent 😭😭
Jfkfkfkkf
Bro is detected
The next penny series: "I survived on $0.01 to travel around the world"
I love how by the end he just has a group of friends with him, it’s so wholesome
do you  like 0.01$
The work place drama was the boss telling the lady that she was out of her mind. I know this because I am Indian and they were talking in Indian
RYAN. TAKE A BREAK PLEASE!!!
I honestly love the caricature idea! It's so much fun! 😀
Check his mod folder
1million views in just 5 hours big UP Ryaaaaaaaan

He's foreshadowing him taking over the world at that last frame
Here before 1 million
Bro u earned a lot more than twenty dollars in that hour. You earned memories of happiness that will last forever. And you earned 20 cents more than 20 dollars.
Bro u feel bad for Ryan for the running but then u remember there’s a camera man…
your lucky I ran out of memes to throw down my building in Manhattan
Did someone count all the "howdys"?
*Withdraws money from the bank*
Bro he was telling her that she is mad in Hindi

Congrats on 10 mil you earned it cowboy
Surprised Ryan doesn’t sign his caricatures lol.
Is this just an exuse for Ryan to draw portraits of people
if you want part 2 like this
At least it’s more than minimum wage.
Content sooo good I might cry watching it.
Demand Another Cross Country Penny Challenge
wouldn’t the pass tense of “speedrun” be “spedran”?
@ 1:45 i feel like there was one shared brain cell between all those guys XD
i just love ryan bro
This guy found irl money glitch
where i live 40 bottles of water is five dollars (at some stores)
3:34 the man just saying in hindi that ARRE TU KYA PAGAL HOGAI HAI 🤣🤣( Meaning - are u mad or what?)
Legends says they are still arguing about that tape
Ryan, may I have that sketch pad when you’re finished?
hustle and bus- WGHKDJBFAWSGHBKJDJSDGJNLFH
ayyy
Ryan should do the penny challenge from maine to mexico
Well I know you don't care but I got the same shoes with Ryan and at first I got bullied but now I feel little better and also what a coincidence 😅
you know he didn't grow up in a city by how he says hi to everyone he passes LOL
$10 for that no sides glizzy?!? Scam.
You should do a $10 to $1000 dollar casino speedrun
Great video! Just my thing.. I am starting to wait for a uncomfty laugh after each sentence. Ucggh
😊Ryan Trajan is next to Olive Garden behind the stair is where it is in time 1:24
For my next money making method I will be robbing this bank but I need a glock to do it so let’s go to my buddy david
❤❤❤
15:19 Is that a dancing statue of liberty?
How many times has he said “Howdy!”
3:47 I actually understand them coz they were talking in Hindi and I understand Hindi
Ryan Trahan: I SMELL PENNIES!!!! Everyone in New York: AAAAAAAAAHHHHH!
14:49 Why is Spider-Man, Sonic, Captain America in the back left?😂😂😂
NO way
Aye some hindi language at 3:41
They need to make a movie about your original serise
The shop owner is Indian 😀❤️❤️
Howdy! This is ICONIC! But... I missed ..THE GREAT RESET. Honestly though it is amazing and your videos always make me laugh!
U Videos just make me smile.. Thanks
next vid spending 365 days trying to survive on 1 penny in all 50 states
the laugh is so funny - love the videos
Random person: Just walking in New York.. Ryan: Running behind them like terminator Random person:🏃‍♂
Good morning sleepy heads
newyork is a different place. you have to give them what they cant get at home.
I missed this
That dollar store owners attitude is funny af haha 😂 I like how he chucks stuff on the counter like an actual badass from a movie
you should do this in london’s piccadilly circus!!!
All i am thinking about is ‘THE GREAT RESET’ and ‘THE GAME PLAN’
bro i doubt your gonna see or think of doing this comment but please bro do my home town oregon. (also you said howdy about 8 or more times idkw i counted😔
The Indian shopkeeper telling his daughter *tum pagal ho gai ho!*
For someone who is broke, Dylan or Brett has a pretty nice iPhone
Ryan: **when in doubt** "HOWDY"
No one's gonna talk about the ending? I mean that was some stress inducing shit 😂
well done
bro is litrally playing gta irl
Ala Ala A A A A A A A
“Spranting”

You turned Nicole into dream
“Am I gonna get hit my a car?”

Bro ngl, those caricatures were actually pretty sick 😂
03:36 Indian Guy Spotted xD
dude got good rng
YES ITS BACK
He’s always awkward😂
Hi
That's not workplace drama,  That's a casual Brown family conversation ☠️
You got me fucked up with that outro
I like how he gives the occasional "howdy" to random strangers as he passes
THE GREAT ESCALATOR CHANGE
Bro is running out of ideas
Howdy.
You saying  howdy in new york
Howdy
Howdy
$20 in an hour that's a dub✌🏽❤️
I KNEW I SEEN HIM I WENDY'S ON 116 A WEEK AGO, I THOUGHT I WAS BUGGING... I SHOULD'VE SAID YERRRRRRRRR!!!!
I love it when Ryan is in a panic but still has to awkwardly and randomly say "Howdy" to the people he walks by.
That first water stop was an Indian
That's so many social interactions, I don't think I'd ever be able to do something like this. 😅
I’m your biggest fan
3:47 Ryan that is how people are treated in india, this goes for students, children and workers, as soon as they make a mistake, they are badmouthed, sadly this is considered a norm in India
Ryan slayed
Airrack casually eating pizza
if so confused you did not zoom out from newyork at the end ?
Early
Cool vid
Hi
ryan is so funny🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
my mans
"I'm gonna go get a glizzy"😂😂😂😂

Ryan is the only cowboy alive

Yeaaqq tysmmmmmmmmmmmm
The things Ryan can do for money. The energy is insane!
Howdy 🤠
Do 1 with "the great reset"
Me waiting for the great reset 😂
This is a penny
yay new vid
Indians in the shop🤣🤣🤣
Being Indian and having understood the full workplace drama, that was probably the most entertaining part of the video
Ryan back with constant uploads
I'm very confused. You can close your eyes and throw a rock and hit a deli in Manhattan. Who the hell would order anything from Subway? I get that tourists may not know better. But if your Grub Hubbing, chances are, you live there.
Howdy counter:99999999999999999999999999999999 Hi/hello counter:5
14:39 Giggity giggity gig.
What are we cheering for??? Ryan: I durno I’m going to buy a glizzy lololol
Anyone noticed Aarick
You must do this in each state and make it a series
That rng is kinda hard to believe🤔
If you see this I hope you have a good day
Mans got desperate after losing views
7:34 Whole Collection Of Arts And Craft Store
Beans
100k likes in 4 hours is insane

THE GREAT RESET
ahhh nostalgic
I LOVE ! PENNY VIDEOS KEEP UP THE FANTASTI WORK RYAN
The drama in the store got me! I understand the language they were talking in, and the whole thing was such a desi mood
If ryan does a penny challenge in Singapore it's not going anywhere.
The Shopkeeper was Indian the was angry on our worker
ryan you are the best youtuber and very hardworking keep it going god bless
Dude stop laughing every second with that air chuckle through the teeth shit holy fck😂 says hi to someone then Laughs. It’s just the teeth sucking noise is so annoying.
I understood the "workplace drama" bc im indian 😂
3:40  Vender: tum pagal ho kya ese kya maths lga rhi ho. Ese nhi hota hee. Translate: are you crazy, what's this calculation you're applying. It doesn't work like that.
*pen girls laughing*
Talented YouTuber I will drop a  video about how much he make on YouTube

$10 for a hotdog? what is it made of? gold?
Imagine your walking around your neighborhood and Ryan trahan appears in your neighborhood
Who else thought that he was gonna do the 30 day challenge but using less days

This guy make me use the Mcdonald app, lol. UNTIL NOW!
Glad to see I'm not the only one realizing how Ryan's social skills improved
Ryan's Team: So how much do you want to milk the penny challenge  Ryan: Yes.
My fav YouTuber
I like how the zoom out of the world didn’t even start from NY 😂
Next time you deliver a penny to Dream in 30 days hahahaha. Would be nice tho
You should definetly get a gimble or something, but great video!
Watching this video with 2x speed  My own Speeerun 😉
Early hello
“Oh haaaai, Ryan. This is the IRS calling. I think you owe us somethin ((:”
Eaely
Someone noticed shopkeeper speaking in Hindi I am from India 🔥🔥🔥
Was the ending a global teaser?
Happy late bday 🎉
My mom hates honey because her business kept getting scammed and she lost a lot of money, just thought I'd say don't use it on small businesses.
Next time he is going to start with 1 million dollars and trade it for a penny
Spider-Man in the background tho at 13:28
i think the title is grammatically incorrect
Yay
*Invest in a GIMBAL* Shaky footage makes me hurl
You should do the penny challenge in Canada 🇨🇦
Always the work drama
the madlad's back
Nah cus my grandma was in New York and she sent me vid of you running on the street and she Said there's a guy on drugs
WTF life really is like a game with npcs, algorithmically generated events and set stages to pass - this is kind of bizarre.
“Why do I bite my nails, it’s always a disadvantage in life”  Dude I felt that.
Nicole looked like dream
I'm calling it now, Ryan is going to do a penny challenge across the world.
The Indian uncle at 3:36 be like: are tum Pagal ho kya? Indians and Pakistanis will understand 😂😂😂
cool
Technically he made thousands with that honey sponsorship
“Guys I got two dollars!!” Lol Ryan you are so wholesome it’s so lovely to watch
Yes milk the 0.01€ thingy
Lesss goo
Wow incredible video!
ten dollars for a hotdog?! damn newyork
"you guys have a great day" 'ok'
NEW
Pani
Was that a $10 glizzy?
It’s crazy how the penny challenge for 30 days was already three months ago😮
Next one traveling around the world with one penny
Do it in another country Ryan!! 😅😅
Indians own the store😂🤩
Haahhhaaa I am an indian and could understand what that indian uncle was saying to the girl...man she got schooled really hard
Pray to god Jesus and Mary
God made the world.sms
God can help you.dnej
God bless you're family.snd
My dude had a game plan....
Is the earth at the end leaking a penny around the world challenge.
this video was extremely fun
What I have noticed with Ryan is he’s not socially awkward he’s awkwardly social 😂😂
outro was so sick
like i said if you are broke and you watch Ryan your just lazy he gives easy money making methods
What I have noticed with Ryan is he’s not socially awkward he’s awkwardly social 😂😂
What I have noticed with Ryan is he’s not socially awkward he’s awkwardly social 😂😂
Where the penny sponsorship
It was an amazing
Katie looks like Lexi from euphoria haha
Indian man know his business 😂
3:25 all will remember meme women
hey ryan, diamond play button when
How can Ryan easily make social contact with random pedestrians... I can barely talking to the cashier at a store😂
A HOT DOG IS 10 DOLLARS????
you should do a penny challenge but with a person hunting you and call it the "penny hunt"
I hope there Bodega starts to go wild with business
When he drew Dylan it looked exactly like dream
The water guys were from India!
My social anxiety could never...just wow I am amused.
Anyone else noticed the spider man when he was drawing people 😂
knowing hindi i can surely say that the shop owner was the girl's father
ryan is cool
ryan's drawing skills are actually solid lol - great challenge loved this video
Penny cross the world
YOU ARE MY FAV BRO! U ARE THE BEST!
The pure joy in his voice us almost concerning
dang she gave you 10 bucks for that huh
For some reason the ending to the video feels philosophical, he did all this in an hour and took time to relax in the rushed environment of New York only to realize his position in the universe.     Idk man just seemed cool
I have a feeling he is preparing a $0.01 series traveling the world.
Time Square is in south America as shown in the end of the video
Props to the camera man sheesh.
BRO I KNEW HE WOULD MAKE A VIDEO LIKE THIS
we arent gonna talk about the blurred shirt?
this man and pennies
Damnnn that indian guy is so lucky he got to open a shop in nyc 🤩
Omg Ryan passed my house!!
Howdy.
newyork%
3:14 the shopkeepers were INDIANS!!!!!😭😭😭
Why do I think he going to across the world with a penny
Do it I do one penny for a whole month or a whole 10 or 10 days stay in New York
Go to philly pa please :(
We the people want wag walk Wednesdays where he takes a wag job every Wednesday and does a podcast
Nope, this ain't a accurate representation of the series. It's missing one main thing.    THE GREAT RESET
3hr ealru
How did the camera zoom out from Panama when they were in New York?????!!?!
Any one noticed that water bottle shop keeper was an indian❤❤
my favorite parts of this video: (this one’s from a caption): pen girls laughing “oh gosh am i gonna be hit by a car??” “i’m gonna do deliver a food, or foods... plural” the elevator went 5 to 6 to 4 “annnnnd action **inaction**”
2:38 BRO I CANT STOP LAUGHING AT HIS LAUGH BAHAHAHAHA
the end of the video got me feeling like some big stuff boutta happen... knowing Ryan he goes above and beyond, so i wouldn't be surprised.
Indian work place drama the best 😂
Dream : I’m about to end this man’s whole career
13:28 spiderman is in the backround
20 bucks an hour is a good wage doing something you love. Ryan keep it up
I will never reach Ryan's dedication in my life
Give yourself like 5 or 10 hours and see what you can do
I loved the indian store keepers arguing  I understood what they said coz i am indian aswell lmao
ok its time. we need Ryans face to be officially on the penny
What is it with you and pennies?
HEY! Im walk'en here!
Ryans video title in a few years... 👉🏽 "TRADING a PENNY for a $45,000,000 Penthouse on the UPER EAST SIDE OF NEW YOUR CITY!!!" 😱
After a whole month he still has the patience to do this again, hats off my man!
As a New Yorker, the craziest thing he did that day was say "Howdey" to everyone 😂
Ten dollars?!?! FOR A HOT DOG?!!!!!??!!!??!!?
New penny challenge idea : I survived off of $0.01 in the most isolated state in America
Man Ryan pissed that Desi family so much
10 dollars for a hotdog?! A hotdog is not worth an hour of labour...
You should do something like this in Canada
ayo did this man just hint that he's going to space 😳
Big Apple baby
Ryan's is a LOT more social now, but still has that quirkiness everyone likes him for
we need more of this
He buys stuff and pit alot of inflation on it lmaoo
Bruh i understood the ppl at the discount shop
that's actually not bad
YES RYAN
3:26 Biharis are pain in the ass even in new york xD xD
11:00 lol got awkward
Did anyone else notice the spider-man in the right side of the screen? 13:27
That's a 2000% increase in one hour
GlLiZzY😊
For anyone who is curious about the "workplace drama" here is the translation:  First Interaction  Man :  Arya (or Anya sorry couldn't make out, girl's name) are you mad? you... Girl : Its because of the tax it's going so high.. Man : Yes  After that as Ryan leaves,   Man : Why do you always charge wrong? (Something like that couldn't hear it properly)   Girl : (Flustered) It's because....(some excuses about how she doesn't know the machine operates that well)   Second Interaction  When the girl tells Ryan to go to that aisle, the man, presumably her father from what i could tell from their interactions, comes in to say:  Man : The tape was right here somewhere......(when he finds it) What is this? (directed towards his daughter(?) not Ryan) Girl : (in a cliche sullen and quite voice) Don't know...  To anyone curios the language spoken was Hindi, one of the major languages of the Indian subcontinent. It was a normal, albeit a bit rude as the man appeared to be annoyed with the girl, interaction between a father and his daughter.
What has one ocean say to the other ocean?      Nothing, they just waved.
Hi
Hhhmm, I am sensing a penny challenge. Not just any challenge. More like crossing the world with 1 penny! 🤭🤭
No one will talk about the couple kissing in the background in the end. It was never meant to hurt us , the single people
NO WAYYYY
The man in the shop is speaking hindi and they are just talking normally 😂😂
Only one
First one
This is Ryan’s challenge now.
bro rly got a set seed
You should do the penny challenge in gta 5
Lmfao i was scared fa u being in my city lol ik how it get😂 but u made it thru da video tho
I just visited New York 😢😢😢
bro the  1 penny series was so good
When ryan bought water they were talking in hindi(A language were spoken in India)
3:52 Wtf is this music lol
This video is a W for you and us💯 But the first shopkeeper was an Indian and was speaking Hindi to that girl💀💀
When the most social person on YouTube says he has no social skills.
This made me happy bc i love your vid
Here we go again
hi
Rayyan make people and him self feel uncomfortable with a joke lol
3:34 Gujaratis all over the world
am i the only one who think kattie is so wholesome?
Wow Indian girl cheating
a very fun video to watch
Ryan plz go to Nashville😊
Nobody told me that he was going to see manly Statue of Liberty!! 😂
Hi
Glad he let us know many attempts
Imagine doing a random order and Ryan comes on your door 😂
bruh what is that outro lol
at the end there was a statue of liberty behind you
This is amazing ❤
that indian guy lol
you should do this in downtown chicago
That Indian guy in the dollar discount absolutely embarrassed the worker
stop saying HOWDY TO RANDOM PEOPLE
Katie is such a sweetheart
Ryan is a literal god send
2:38 that laugh :)
Me knowing what the discount manager said to her LOL
They are hindi people. My parents can speak that language
NAWWWW  the shop manager

LETS GO COIN CHALLENGE PART 2
I love how ryan hits that guys scissors with his rock like we did in elementary school
BRO IVE BIN WAITING DUDE YOUR VIDS ARE AMAZING SO I WAITED TILL YOU UPLOADED
BRO IVE BIN WAITING DUDE YOUR VIDS ARE AMAZING SO I WAITED TILL YOU UPLOADED
I missed the penny challenge, I couldn’t watch the OG series every day it came out so it is nice to watch this one the exact day it came out :D
now for some reason, even after watching the video everything I do feels like I have a 60 minute timer to do it in
WE MISSED U BRO
I've learned from this video that Ryan's catchphrase is "Howdy".
id much rather do that for an hour then work for an hour for the same pay
The cameramen doesn’t get paid enough to run after Ryan
Penny across the world challenge? - That zoom out at the end makes me feel like Ryan is up to something.
For those wondering what they were talking about with the workplace drama  Paagal ho tum = You are an idiot (1st time)After he left = How come you put an extra 75 cents The second time at checkout = something something there was/is tape here, what is this DISCLAIMER: I'm quite choppy and may have translated things wrong or not word for word so take these translations as a rough basis of what they were talking about
i just realised that at the end it zooms out of south america and not New York 🤣
Ryan if you ever come to Chicago dont ask for ketchup on your glizzy lol just get it plain and grab some ketchup packets on the way out. TRUST ME! lol
bro the rng is insane
Please,  atleast give credit to the man who did the idea first, @mane yousuf did it a whole week ago, its unfair 😗😗

LMAO I thought Kevin Hart was just chilling at 14:51
Yes water bottles are amazing
12:18 Guy stopped filming after he saw the picture.
$5 above minimum wage. That's all I'm sayin yall
Howdy
I love his akwardness
you gonna explain airrack?
5:49 “how does anyone navigate here?” Answer from a New Yorker: GPS
You could literally put out videos like this every time you are between epic video ideas, and it would be entertaining.
you should do one of these in every state
Insane seed
Damm £20 and hour ain’t bad.
is this the first guy in the world that speedran a penny?
So basically Per HR - $20 Per Day(8 hr) - $160 Per Month - $4800
Ryan inspires people on so many levels.  ❤️
10:10 I speedruning organizing my cloths bc I got 2 mins left before the game starts
Yes yes yes yes yes yes yes 🥰 yes
Hahahahahahahahhaha
Guess what, todays wordle is howdy
Dude getting $20 an hour damn
LEGEND IS BACK BOISSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!
Ryan asking new yorkers where the subway is 🧍
hey  ryan we want  penny challenge AGAIN
I dont know why but there’s just something about his voice that just sounds soo awkward 😂
This guy needs action mode with the iPhone 14 Pros to keep up with this running lol
Howdy
i swear theres something wrong with the thumbnail😂
its so funny seeing him say  "Howdy" to everyone
5:10 "Howdy" "yep yep yep yep yep" 😂😂
Lol am I the only one who could understand what the shopkeeper and the employee was saying 😂
His cough(?) sounds bad. Get well soon! 😆
Is nobody gonna talk about how at the end he showed the whole earth? This might mean…
In 3:45 there the shopkeeper speek in hindi?
3:50 spotted an Indian ✌
8:28 i think the girl is kind of new to the store and is not able to find stuff The man comes and says ye kya hai which means "whats this then" reffering to the tape and no drama it also happens with me in my parents store like i dont where the stuff is
“I want a glizzy…so bad” -Ryan Trahan 2022
pretty sure he's foreshadowing that he's going to try 1 penny across the world lol
Good one Ryan ☺️
In germany the police would ask where the Gewerbeschein is😂
I mean you made more in that hour than most people do at their actual job in an hour.
My man speedruning adulthood
Indian laughing when the shopkeeper said "pagal hai kya " 🤣🤣
I can’t wait for “The History Of The $0.01 Challenge World Records” video in 5 years
I never done uber eats or anything like that but I was wondering do they pay you same day or a week after ?
Bro doing it again
Oh gud here we go again  Next .... ryan need a new idea pls
How is bro in New York but zooms out from Brazil this guy
What is funny is that is actually a lot of money for 1 hour, if you made that a full time job for 10 hours a day that is 200 dollars and for a week that is 1400 dollars which is roughly 5600 dollars a month which is enough to have a small studio apartment which is impressive
Bro needed views
Oh wow
10:46 "in a minute" ayo
Am I the only one who noticed that there is 2 Spidermen in the back? I think its in reference to the electro fight scene in TAS 2. 13:24 13:27
4:00 because they are indian lol
Ryan should cross the entire world in 100 days with $0.01
The man in the start was indian
Howdy 🤠

Howdy nervous laughter
Howdyyy

hiii Ryan…. Sorry I have to say this, We can all agree that Ryan makes sure that all of his videos are such high quality
Bro back with his legendary content 🛐
penny challenge around the world 3 months would be amazing
now go from new york to oregon, you wont, your too scared c'mon ryan😐, it'll be fun, i live in oregon😂
i was like " this seems like so much work for 20 dollars" then i realized that 20/hr is what most ppl make really puts into perspective
I want more videos from New York . This city is insane
I JUST REWATCHED THE SERIES AND YOU DO THIS THANK YOUUUUUUU
And we are back again 😂❤
I'm so happy that Ryan is back I missed the penny videos and his new videos are so good
706 thousandth
Why did Spiderman walk by at 13:28 ???
I grew up in the middle of no where and just watching this makes me agitated
Here before trending #1
Put a “ Howdy” count on the screen 😭😭
What is the name of the song at 0:05
That girl from that Drama store should resign.
I would love to watch those 7 tries bloopers ryan and talking about this video its just soo good thinking about crazy ideas is an art
You would have been better off pan handling and just asking for money
Hi
I cant belive that there is an Indian guy in the Newyork store
I just like watching Ryan being so nice to people in NYC
That is exactly what scared money dont make money means rofl
Ryan Trahan's camera Man running like the fastest man in the world
I escaped earth with 1 penny
If you think about it, that’s a $20 an hour job😮
Please do a speed run challenge all around the country and world. It will allow you to explore and make us happy
yessssssssssssss lets go back to the 00.1 dollar challenge i love these
lol
Do 1 week in NY
The series was the best
First shopkeeper was Indian 🤣🤣🤣 nice
SHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESH
One of the best seeds I have seen
Next time is going to be I traveled around the world to deliver a penny to Joe Biden. 😂. Love your vids Ryan, keep up the great work.
Props to the camera man for following him
It's funny that I am indian and the shopkeepers are also Indian and I can understand their words and what they are saying 🤣
honestly this is kinda inspiring
I was so invested the whole time! $20 an hour is good money lol 🙌
Bro got 700k views in 6hrs sheesh
Ryan literally is just the penny man by this point they might as well put him on the penny 😐
Any% Penny Challenge - Ryan Trahan 20:60
Ryan is gonna be the guy who becomes a van guy.. lol
He makes more money per hour than me   I’m a student and unemployed but still
Work place drama in hindi 😂😂😂😂
Funny thing is that today's WORDLE word is HOWDY
Noice
Cross THE WHOLE WORLD with one penny!!! That would be the craziest series in THE WHOLE WORLD!
There is no way he spent 10 bucks on a glizy 😮
3:35 Indian Spotted for those who didn't understand what he said " Are tum pagal ho kya 0.75 cents laga rahi ho " mean are you mad you are charging 0.75 cents
that outro was unreal
Okay, so at the start made 6 dollars in 15 minutes, so technically if I did this I could get  24 an hour, damn
you shouldve used the wall street clip. it allows you to become a regular 9-5er and embezzle money, and in an hour you could embezzle alot. ofc. after that. the game could bug out and the police will chace you for no reason, sadly.
The mhheheheheheh littel made me die of laghuter
Dylan said he was broke and then pulls out his iPhone 12 Pro msc
I literally passed you you
Respect to the camera man
Ryan how does it feel having the same birthday as me
In every second of the video Ryan always say howdy!
Take a shot every time Ryan says howdy
Nice
Bro got "The great Reset" many times and never gave up.
this guy is genius. i would have just draw the person and not have a conversation with them but he had a conversation and draw at same time and they gave him extra money for being cool..
We need penny around the world now
Oh wow
3:37 - That Indian was like " Are pagal ho kya tum" And it means are you actually mad 😂😂 Surely he is a common Indian Parent same as hell Love to see someone of our kind
I Bite my nails all the time, wether I'm at school, or at home playing video games, I always bite my nails.
Let’s go another good video
Not sure if I'm stupid but why didn't you tape the characture  sign to a wall instead of having it lean.
What a great ending👀
nothing beats the giggles at the start bro love your content
Get ready for part 2 where you have one year to travel the world 😂😂😂
That Indian shopkeeper 😂😂
abcd
the fact  i understand what the guy said to the girl in the store is just 😂😂😂
So much nostalgia...
6:51 🤨🧐😲
W Ryan
3:35 tum pagal hogyi ho only indians can understand 😁😎
You actually made 20 dollars in an hour that's nearly double minimum wagw
His elevator experiences are very relatable
When you see rayan hold a penny 💀
Ryan’s cameraman got a whole workout
Ryan is genuinely my favorite youtuber. His videos entertaining and hilarious, and his personality is too good. Plus the way he just has relationship with God without all the “church” stuff is awesome. Your just an awesome guy :)
Ryan I would love to see THE NEXT LEVEL of the Penny serie: crossing the world
great RNG on this run
howdy
posted on my birthday. >: )
this is like a dlc
Do a year long version going all around the world
3:36 Indian guy
It’s not the drawings. He sells himself. Charismatic and dishes compliments. The guy who didn’t donate is a bum.
Howdy
Ryan should do this as a side hustle drawing art for $2+ prob more since he's a yt
That man was saying that are you mad to that girl in hindi😂
When you realize Ryan is basically scamming people for views:
Oh wow….another penny challenge..
Ryan can you come to Brooklyn Newyork I am living there can you plz :)
2:35 Its the Mmmmmhhhh HEHEHE for me.
Bro is milking this but it's still entertaining
**insert dream music**
When you gonnna try this in the ocean😆? the mermaids might not know what howdy means though 😆😆
Great job Ryan 20 bucks in one hour was impressive I would not be able to do that  also great caricatures I also wouldn’t be able to do that 👏👏👏
i loved the 30 days series, great idea. keep up the good work.
3:45 he scolded her😂
10 dallors for a hotdog thats what i took from this 😅
$10 for a hot dog is too much in most of the planet 😅
Love that countdown🤣💀
Maybe a europe one? (probably not but thanks for the awesome content)
Jeez ur getting popular so quick this video barely came HOURS AGO and u already gained almost 1 million views on this atleast thats insane
before the insane penny challenge u had almost 7 mil subscribers, almost 3 months after that you have like 10 MIL! that is so insane!
"Pagal ho tm" that uncle🤣🤣
i'll never get tired of ryan's "howdy!"
the manager said : r u crazy?
.
Hi
I will never borrow water from a stranger because of spree 😭😭
THE OWNER SAID IN HINDI THAT "YOU ARE MENTAL" at 3:36
I love how in the end he zoomed out not from new york
I saw a video on tik tok where you where in a ice cream shop and thy couldn't trow the ice cream balls because someone had left them to freeze or so ting like that
Nice
This video is so wholesome
Hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
did you noticed that the man in the store once said , "yeha kahi par tape tha" in hindi
It's officialy time to do "I traveled the entire world for 1 cent to meet the president of China"
NAHH U DID NICOLE DIRTY 😭😭😭
that Indian marchant makes me feel Pride that he has footaged in rains video
ggwp ryan
That shop keeper tho 😅
I respect how much time and effort ryan puts into every one of his videos
AROUND THE WORLD WITH 1 PENNY
what running out of content looks like...
How come I never thought of this. Work somewhere where you get paid lots and live somewhere that’s pretty nice but cheaper. My lord
Nostalgia
The next thing he is gona do is he is gona cross the world with a peny😂
I love his videos, but I don’t understand.. Why does he do these videos? Why so much effort? What’s motivation?  Edit: I think I figured it out
What airrack was doin there ahaha
Ryan is the example of ADHD in a nutshell💀
OMG. i was just yesterday talking how i miss the penny series and now this? YES!
Indian things are all about drama 😜😜😜
Right when they got to 1 it reached 10:00 for me
is end of video a teaser for 1¢ all around the world?
𝓒𝓸𝓶𝓶𝓮𝓷𝓽
Bruh
That ending gave me an existential crisis
Hi
Yey
Ryan saying Howdy in New York
Let’s go
Great SpeedRyan challenge.
The people at the end were so wholesome. Respect to them
3:35 he aery tum pagal ho gaya that was an indian store
Ryan: "You guys have a great day :)" Man: "Okay."
Hi
"why do i bite my nails" im seriously biting mine right as im watching this
the way the shopkeeper said "tum pagal ho gayi ho lol"
Loved the vibe when he was drawing
Welcome to my home state where winter is 9 months of the year
Those store owners were so desi!!🤣🤣
I live in Canada and I went to New York City during the summer, it was one of the best places I’ve ever been to
They must think he’s crazy asking where the subway is, it’s everywhere!
Doggy
So cool
Great videos keep up the good work
10:01 lol
Try New Mexico
I miss the I miss the surviving of with 1 penny sereis
“I promise I won’t let the excitement get to my head.” Also Ryan: Running and giggling like he’s high 😂
I don't know if it is a good Idea  But if you see this Ryan can you please make the ending where the earth fades and the screen become full of star so it kinda acts like  a loop if you watch from the starting again
for 3 water he is bangla an he call you stupid
btw, if your still in NY there is a restraunt called gray dog, it was an extortionary experience
video idea: what if whostheboss was hunting him while hes doing the one peny challenge
i think dream would be able to break the world record
🦃
100000000000000000000000000 IQ 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Dude I love that the shopkeeper was indian like mr
Haha the convenience store workplace drama. 🤣
3.. 2.. 1  *What*? Ryan : I don’t know       Saddest story ever.
3:35 the shop keeper said to the girl that shes dumb in indian
I wonder if he met anyone from the low balling video
hi ryan this is asa can we please be in one of your videos!!!!please
Love ya Ryan... your the man ..
It’s a great place to get robbed and killed. I mean is a democrat front state, so there is no laws there.
Easterly awaiting a comment from Louis Rossman
Nobody: Texans in New York: "Howdy"
That store from which you bought all the stuff he was Indian.
I love this series! Keep going Ryan.
Didn't know that new york was located in middle america
That store owner was speaking hindi  I feel like he's family
I love this guy's content.
Pls Marke a 1 Penny Series in Germany it would be so Great pls
as a european this whole tax thing is crazy to me.
bros playing with set seed
He should do the penny challenge challenge in a different country
Crossing the earth with 0.01?
Imagine doing this for a week. You'll be able to pay for the trip within the first 24 hours.
Bros got dream luck 💀💀💀
"aree tum kya pagal hot kya" that line   03:30
At 2:06 you can see hesitation. He was gonna choose something else but he saw scissors so he kept his hand in a rock shape.
Let’s see how much subscribers I can get on this comment😊
He’s just so nice and straight forward :)
Omg I love that your back you make the best vids
bro he got the perfect seed for the speedrun... Might even have beaten Dream
3:54 indian guy op❤️
I'm going to go get a grizzly 😂
Always creative ❤
The act of speedrunning is a very complicated activity, and it is hard to pinpoint where it started, but all we know now is that if you have a game, it takes less than a penny to start
That store person from where he bought three waters were indians
Go to Massachusetts please 😅😊
Demn
W
Should have had the Mini-Reset...... You would never finish off the donation required was something regular oriole could afford.
Great video Ryan, Keep it up!
Buddy is running out of ideas
I never seen anyone who could squeeze out more from penny than Ryan. Excellent job :DD.
I’m sitting here screaming “YOU DON’T HAVE TIME TO DO A SPONSORSHIP RYAN!” 😂😂😂
9:09 lol i laughed so hard
Nice
No way!😂 this is amazing!
YES
Nice
I love how you went from building a camp site to this keeping us viewers on our toes 😂
Next Ryan Trahan Video: I have to go Outer space  in 30 days with $0.01
I’ve been with this man since under 1 million, it’s amazing how far he’s gotten
i love how he literally says anything and then interrupts himself immediately with “howdy” every 2 seconds
whats the music called in the beginning
lol at 3:35 they were arguing in urdu/hindi/punjabi
uncordinated like casey lol
14:38 bro lookin like dream in his facereveal
How many Howdys did Ryan say today 🤣 love it
I thought you'd be speedrunning getting across america with a penny
no one: Ryan: Howdy!
Ryans speeding around: Don’t be surprised when I’m sprinting  The camera man: Silence mortal
I’m a little worried about what the zoom out to the entire world at the end means
todays wordle was howdy :D
Speedran 🤣
ohh there is erik from @airrack
That's over minimum wage!
Imagine you are walking by listening to music, then a running man comes saying howdy to everyone. Then you walk more and see the man coming at you and saying "You want some bottles?".
WOAH 20/1HR I should consider doing this as a job
Nobody can hustle like Ryan. And he proves there is no excuse if you want to make $.
The guy and girl at 5th Ave Dollar Discount were Indian and spoke Hindi...... I am super happy by seeing them :D
Wow!!! Ryan Trahan keep up the excellent work!!! I love your videos and how you do so much for your viewers!!!
why is there a spiderman in the backround13:27
It was 10 dollars for one hot dog ?

Ryan walking from that street I always remember 9/11 WTC

3060 Ryan Trahan: “I’m going to travel to every planet and solar system using 1 penny!”
gulp ! ! !
1 hour, he multiplied his penny 2060 times
that shopkeeper was an indian i understand because he was talking in hindi some time
was it just me or did anyone else see airrack at the beginning of the video....?
Not only is this fun to watch it teaches you how you can get some quick cash
Dude the first store where he went in was an Indian drama
Bro 3 time ugh
"pagal ho thum" -  discount store man
The store people were from India I could understand what they were saying
HES SPEED RUNNING IT NOW?
cameraman is insane bro
Okay, Was The Planet Earth At End ForeShadowing? I feel it was foreshadowing, Oh Gawd! A trip Around the world!!
Literally made like 30 an hour
Ryan actually made $20/hr if hedud this everytime everyday which is decent
why is airrack in the intro at 0:20
Howdy
Do it again in 24 hours
Bro istg nyc is becoming the next LA and im not here for it, I wonder if these influencers are going to destroy our city like they did with la
Hey Ryan congrats on getting 10 mil 🎉 you deserve it 😊❤
Just normal Indian parent in store 😂
me understanding hindi, and that cashier guy calling the girl "pagal ho tum" which translates to "You are absolutely crazy" got me rolling on the floor for no reason😂😂
do 2 hours easily $100+
ryann i love u
THE PENNY GOD
I got dizzy looking at him running
Eeeeee
Hey bro, I dare you to do the penny challenge in a country in which you have little to no viewers like India where you have to collect enough money to buy yourself a plane ticket to return home in a certain period of time and donate the funds raised during the challenge to support people of that country. As, this will make the challenge even harder as you will have to face many challenges like language barrier, different environmental conditions and almost no subscribers to help you this time and it will also make the challenge more exciting.
the sequal we never knew we needed
Nah bro he became dream 💀
You can’t convince me you didn’t collab with the New York Times on today’s wordle
No! Why is it when I leave NY Ryan comes here!
Living in New York is so expensive. I would know 😔 but someone like Ryan could have an easy time here with his amazing personality.
PIU
This man literally makes more money from starting from a penny than working a 9 to 5 job.
That indian guy saved the day. 🤣
These Penny Challenged Keep Getting Crazier And Crazier!🤣 Love These Videos Ryan ❤
Ryan in 2050) I will survive a plane crash
Anyone notice airrack in the intro
No ones taking about Indian shopkeeper
the last bit second where it zooms out onto earth is a hint at ryan doing an arould the world penny challenge
AIRRACK!!!!!!!!
lol
This is amazing proof that Youtube is still evolving as a platform and that there is no one model for success! :)
I guess your known as the penny guy now even though I’ve watched you since like 2017
Anyone notice the guy take a pic of Ryan? Lol
That shopkeeper was indian
We want more videos
Yo who’s that handsome guy at the beginning ???
Omg when did he hit 10m
shoutout to the camera man for going to space at the end bro
I love when it goes all quiet then it Ryan says howdy
You're so inspirational ❤️
8:25 lengends know that the shopkeeper Is Indian 😂
You are awesome; wish I knew that you were in town
Ummmm... The end tho
I think myself a simple man. He uploads, instant click from me.
Time to speed run across America.  No resets no nothing.  You have to make it across in as little time as possible with one penny
now do it in europe
that indian dad in the dollar store made ryan's day xD
F R O G G I E S
12:19 anyone notice the dude in the background taking a photo of Ryan, stalker vibes ngl
Wait a minute...In New York is 10 dollar a hot dog?? A simply little Hot dog?
I loved this, great memories from summer!
This guy should have his face on every penny
So happy to listen hindi in your video please come to india
Shout-out kate
Surprised bike didn’t get stolen
He’s so awkward but in a good way
That "for what?" At the end was so cute I love her lmao
U slay Ryan

9:26 I wonder what that shirt said...
Notice 20bucks
It would be cool if he made a 1 hour live steam doing this challenge
Bro fumbled the bag cuz she was feeling him
Loved this haha.
You can tell you grew up in a small town because you have manners and are polite to people no matter the situation. Great video man. Keep it up!
omg i understood the angry discount store !!
Ryan is the man of youtube; he KNOWS how to entertain, im lterally gonna do the penny challenge because of him thank you ryan kepp up the OUTSTANDING work!!
People from india understand the workplace drama lmao

A new York hot dog costs 10 💵??????? omg that's expensive

You should’ve paid Katie for the good advertising job she did
bro got no shame
ain't no way you paid 10 bucks for a glizzy its 1 dollar
2:13 he forgot to say no homo 💀💀
There is some gravity in you, your vids and your character man  Such a nice guy, very kind and wholesome, and stupidly awkward 😂 We love u and support u man, u r among the few who reflect the actual beauty of life.. Huge respect bro 👍🏻 Love from India ❤️❤️❤️
Another amazing video!
3:34 Indians can understand 👀😂😂🇮🇳
HIS WHEEZING
hehehehaw
Ryan Trahan probably top 3 youtuber in the entire world, number one for me ❤ ❤ ❤
10 bugs for a hot dog?
that indian guy saying "pagal ho gaye ho" tho 😆
Bro that shop girl and her manager is Indian
You NEED to do the wordle today
If the average one month work paycheck average is 6k and this dude makes 20 dollars per hour then 20x24 then he makes 480 per day and 480x31 is around 14k meaning this method is over double better to make money than the average job
A $10 HOTDOG!!!
as a new yorker, ive never heard a guy ever say howdy in new york city
Why do u keep saying howdy lol
So the penny thing was like your one hit wonder and now you’re trying to make the same formula over different variants  Low creativity and bad video btw

Ryan Trahan / Giga Chad

New Idea, One Penny Around the World!
Coulda won 2000 bucks sitting down with a cup
i just noticed that the discount store guy is actually Indian
Brett is mysterious
As a NYC citizen, I definitely approve of this
You should do one of these in every state
Wow, this guy has an obsession with pennies
Sus vid
My favorite YouTuber in my favorite city Crazy!
The Ave Discount Store you went to buy bottles was owned by an Indian b'coz he was yelling at his employee in Hindi. Loved the video ❤️❤️
Im indian and the guy was BASICALLY shouting at her for scamming the wrong type of person and not to scam THESE TYPE OF PEOPLE thats why
Ryan: *runs* Camera man: You have no idea how fast I really am.
HE IS DOING IT AGAIN PEOPLE!!!
Drawing tips:  Make the skin outline first  And when making clothes make the main outlines than the smaller ones (Like the pockets and the other small details) I really hope this helps since i draw :)
20$ an hour with no setup is double minimum wage. let that sink in
The MH-heheheheh made me laugh ngl I laugh at stupid things-
Yessss sirrrrrr
The person in the discount store was indian only the manager the girl was most probably from one of the other Asian country
20 bucks an hour is not bad
10:00 why do i bite my nails its always a disadvantage made me laugh dying 😂
Work drama thata common in india. Only Indian people can relate 😂
What happened to Ryan’s McDonald’s ice coffee
3:45 proud to see indian man there much love from india ryan bro.
RYAN IF you where still there i would have gave you 100

Nice
At 6:30 he went in a hotel I went in a couple of weeks ago.. when I did a tours of America
I just went on a NYC vacation, and the amount of times you passed close to my hotel is scary...
Going across the world with one penny coming soon?
YES I LOVE THIS CHALENGE BRINGS BACK MEMORIES😭😭😭😭😭😭
Do one for a day
Theory about the end: Is Ryan going to travel around the world starting from a penny like the 30 day one?
GEEZE $10 FOR A GLIZZY
It took the man 30 days when he could have done it in an hour??
Ryan all time be like: Howdy 😁
.
can you do a penny challenge where you have to get to every continent in less than 3 months (it gives you 3 months of content)
Kya tum pagal ho tum 😂
Can you do %any now instead of %glitchless
Howdy
woow
Try the penny challenge in Europe.  And yes I know its a dumb idea.
Ryan going to space next confirmed?? 😂😂
Penny challenges are the best
All the people who know Urdu know how mean that boss was at the shop
1 cent is not 0.01 it is 0.1. I hope u change the title
3:35 is that hindi? Because if it is he just called the lady mad lol
I have that exact sketch pad 😂
Oh boy you know it’s a good day when Ryan uploads but it’s a GREAT day when you see $0.01 in the title
The word for wordle today is howdy

Genuinely wish you dont do anymore penny content. Your series was a masterpiece and shouldnt get sequels.
this made me realize how much i miss his penny series
Me and Ryan have the same birthday And we both chew our nails were the same person
Penny challenge around the world? I hope you rested well these past few weeks.
Do a “traveling around the world on one penny “
That man there in the grocery store  Was an i Indian
“i did the penny challenge on mars”
He’s back at it❤❤

9:00 PH flag check 🇵🇭🏃‍♂️🤣
Is anybody else realise that at 8:28 that shop keeper said ' Ye kya hai ' it means that shop keeper is indian 🇮🇳🇮🇳
Jesus Loves y'all and Is The Way To Everlasting life 🤍✝️🤍
How many times did this guy say howdy
To all the people who are saying "this proves you can do anything to make money" I just wanna say that having a camera person, nice clothes and a cute face ☺ makes it a lot easier
This is one of the best content on YouTube what happened to the McDonald’s Ice coffee
indians are awsm:)
3:51 indian or pakistanis show up saying pagal ho kya??
Love this dude's laugh :D
E
The RNG in this run was crazy
8:04 * in a shop* "You guys know what im about to do" * pulls out a guun🔫* 😂😂😂

20 dollars an hour is great pay
All you need is a great and honest personality. ❤
The shopkeeper  from Ryan buy water is Indian
6:39 My timer went off as soon as he said Action.
*cartoon eyes bulge out*
11:27  lets forget the fact that he accidentally drew mustache even tho none of the boyz have one
time to live off mic Donalds 😂
when you realize workers are from🇮🇳/🇵🇰
Yeeeeey
howdy
3:35 The store owners are Indians. I heard the man speak Hindi. He said, "Have you gone mad?"
The earth in the end could be hinting toward a 'penny across the world'   I'm hooked!
jimmy is already bored 0/10
3:35 - Indian people recognise a Indian when they see one
You should've met tommyinit there
Ryan you should do penny challegne across the world
WR

He's back!!!!!
Should come to Australia and do it in Melbourne
LETSSS GOOOO
He got a good seed
I was watching this video and then my neighbour came and we watched it together. He said that this video changed his life and touched his heart. I then went and rented a projector in a big field and all my villagers watched it and it changed their lives too. We all are so grateful. Thank You for this video Ryan.
Ryan commented on my last video lmao can't believe that.. thanks @ryantrahan i appreciate what you said tho I'll try not to do it anymore
You need to make a pennie series  but you are with another youtuber
3:50 they are speaking in hindi
To think that you can make such a good video in 1 hour.
TEN DOLLARS FIR ONE JIH HOTDOG?????
Think he has the world record of saying howdy
OH YEAH RYAN
A great challenge would be going up to people and having them trade you 1 dollar for one penny. So how much dollars you would make 👍👍👍👍
At the end of the video I saw Spider-Man, Captain America, Sonic and Mickey Mouse in the background!
Ryan you're such a nice guy that after seeing your videos I don't know how but my heart feel at ease ☺️☺️😊😊🤗   Love it ❤️❤️
The work place drama people are indian
he should do this money series in the uk or in europe
Happy late birthday Ryan!!!!!
Yasssssss
"*pen girls laughing*" had me rolling
There shouldve been the great reset

Ryan is so entertaining
I can't wait for Ryan to do this on another   country like Australia or even across Europe
RYAN IM SO SAD I DIDN'T SEE YOU I WAS IN THE CITY!!!
At the last three minutes there is a spiderman walking in the background
*HE HAS TWO DOLLARS!*
The Statue of Liberty guy at the end of the video in the background though 🤣🤣🤣 The things you can find in New York 🙄🤣🤣🤣
:D
the penny series helped me during the summer break when i had no friend to out with
This was dope!!
🗿
This is so interesting to watch 😭
Ryan needs a gymshark sponsorship
Pro
Before anyone scrolls down on this comment just read this trust me it's worth it. Just imagine one day Ryan is gonna start off something along the lines of travelling the world with 0.01 cents
cant wait for crossing the world in 6 months
Bro pls do more of these penny challenges i just love them
I live in New York
put some pegs on that citi bike

I will give you a penny for a shout out to Mike Odyssey! lol Help kick off the next vid!😅I loved the caricature in 60s lol I think its more about the smiles than the art lol
i love when ryan is saying something or just like walking by people and he says "hi" or "howdy"  like i can't even engage in a conversation that is hella impressive

3:34 they called you crazy people in hindi???
Omg in that shop the persons are Indians they are speaking hindi
2:17 Ryan needs the new Action Mode on the iPhone 14 for these kinds of videos 😂
you already know he has shook the workplace and left his mark forever
video idea: detroit speedrun: you must speedrun making money in the slums of detroit and get out as fast as possible
What is with Ryan and PENNYS
Hi Ryan just wanted to tell you if you want to do a speed run in a small place come to Singapore it’s one of the smallest country you would most likely be able to get everywhere easier
13:16 my name is Dylan XD
Why do you say “howdy” to random ppl lol cringe
3:48 where the shop keepers Indians 😃
Ahh! The shopkeeper's Indian
Well he have to keep to the pen sales. Profit is x100 which is very good, despite of low inputs
Easy First $1 Method: Go up to someone and say i bet a dollar i can get someone to gamble with me with about this penny.  If they accept ez first dollar.
Not workplace drama  it's  Indian  parent   drama
Ayo W's for the Indian cashier!
nah bro a glizzy for 10 dollars is a scam
3:35  the sales man ask his daughter  if she is mad or not  8:27 sales man says tape was somewhere here when he finds the tape he says so what is this  to his daughter ofc   no need to thank me m a good guy
Bfdi
damn
Ryan, keep up the good work! You are awesome, and personally I think one of the only good youtubers out there. Love your videos and keep loving the Lord!
9:26 I wonder why some of the people's shirts in the background are blurred out?
Store man is indian
The end might be a hint to I traveled the world with one penny for a year or moth or something like that
bro 1h ago and you already have 600k views.....
Kentucky
Oh the misery everybody want to be my enemy
A hotdog for $10?  That’s insane
ryan should autograph those 60 second pictures also i think in future!
Shish
Why does Ryan always do the hardest challenges?
Next penny series: crossing the world with 1 penny but I only have 1 year
Video Idea: Survive with 1 penny for 30 days in Chicago
Pagal ho tum😅😅 Means you are mad  they must be family in the way he said it
The work place were Indians or pakistanis
“Hello i have uh subway”  -Ryan trahan 2022

Hello Ryan
hi ryan
Nerd 🤓
Haha Typical Indians
How's the cashier woman doing?
Ryan ain’t local lol
thats a 1/1 trillion% chance, dont think this speedrun is legit
the first shopkeeper was indian
i'm concerned for his mental health
Not the penny again...
This video makes me feel like o am reliving my summer
You should cross the world with one penny!! lol😂
10 bucks for a glizzy is INSANE
13:27 LOOK AT THE BACKGROUND THERE IS SPIDERMAN
Dream music intensifies     But really someone should make this a speed run category
"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life."     -John 3:16 God gave us his only son Jesus Christ who Lived a sinless Life then died on the cross to endure our punishment, he rose again on the 3rd day and is currently seated at the right hand of God the Father Almighty.   We have all sinned against the Perfect and Holy God that gave us Life, we all deserve the Punishment of Hell for our sin/rebellion against him.  We have all Broken the Moral Law in our Hearts, even if you don't believe in Jesus, or have never heard of him or the Law of Moses or the Bible, you are still sinful and on your way to Hell. But the GOOD News is that Jesus Christ took our sin upon himself by being Crucified and shed his Blood as payment for our Sins.   He took our Punishment and gave us his reward of Eternal Life in Heaven  Jesus is returning to Judge the world soon my Friends Please Repent and believe in his sacrifice and Love for you, believe in him as your Lord and Saviour, and you shall be saved.   May God Bless you all, Maranatha!!
Wow that indian guy at discount store
He keeps on finding ways to do the penny challenge
The fact that the store Ryan went to for the water was owned by Pakistani
I saw u 💀
Speedrun in every city in America 🇺🇸👀
THE OWNER OF CONVINIENT STORE IS AN INDIAN😁😁😁
Hooray, more Mc Chickens and iced teas for Ryan!
Can we all appreciate Ryan's actually impressive art skills.
the conversation at the budget store between the employees was funny (i know what they were saying)
This man is insane in a good way i love it
Awesome!
The store owner called the girl crazy or Paagal in hindi
2:38 lol his laugh 😂
8:30 The Indian drama never stops 🤣🤣,  big looolll !!!
Ayo I was in the city a few weeks aho
Ryan. Can you please try to do your penny challenge in another country. Like maybe a penny challenge in South America then Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and then like maybe two in Asia because Asia is just big like that.
in time 3.43 they are talking in hindi and the man is telling the girl mad
If you did that all day every day for a year you would have made $148,920 (if you don’t spend any on food or water)
hi
Saying howdy to everyone gets me.  If he did this where I lived it'd be no problem, but here, ya know.
That was a Indian person from the store he purchased the waters
Where’s the McDonald’s iced coffee??😮
Lol y
Trust me u gonna cross 100m subs soon :)
$10 for hot dog?? You got robbed. That’s $3-4 in Manhattan.
15:14 $10? For one hot dog? Scam
Bro should I tried being a hotdog vendor
DAMN!
you are insane!!!
That water bottle shop owner said "tum pagal ho" mean "are you mad" to the worker, love from India bro. ❤️❤️
ryan is the best keep going ryan never stop until you die
Hats off to camera man... he's equally involved✨
I swear to god if you try to cross the world then I’m sorry u are not completing that
Hello Ryan
The shop guy is also from India 😂😂
Next summer he should travel to Alaska, (Alaska does not have major cities besides 1) to lubec Maine , eastern most point in the U.S
OMG RYAN U MADE 2X MINIMUM WAGE ;0
Ryan: Craziest workplace drama I've ever seen. They're INDIANS 😂🤣 So, no surprise.
Howdy everyone.
One dude at the store was arguing in Hindi
Any indian 👇👇
E
I think the ending is foreshadowing for a penny across the world challenge.
2:39 IM LITTERALY HAVING SO MUCH FUN uhhuhhhhhuhuuuhh *gasp* 😫😛😫 😂😂
Oh this store owner is from India and speaking hindi
It spell's speedrun
13:27 spiderman chilling in the back
The penny challenge is back!😀
At this point your name isn’t Ryan your the penny guy
I speak indian and here si the captions for 3:48 :  Man: Are u an idiot, yes girl:Sorry Man: I will get u fired Girl: Ok im sorry.  Now its 8:27 Man2:What is this girl:Pen
$20 in an hour is actually not that bad
3:44 he says how did you manage to put 75 cents ? 8:27 he asks her what is this
The fact that I live there is amazing how I’ve meborized Manhattan and I’m just like GO TO 6 TH STREET GO GO GO
3:36 what he said was your an idiot fyi
Growing up in nyc it is so busy and everyone is pushing each other around and it was so easy to make money by selling art in time square to visitors you should have done it more
Man's really milking this penny thing 😂
Sheeeeeeeeesh
Ryan always make money making look so fun!! 😂😂
឵឵
Ryan made more in 1 hour than I do in hour at work in an hour. I should definitely stop working. :P
"pagal ho gayi ho kya tum"  got me so bad😂😂
indian man at store : paagal ho tum  ryan : that was a craziest workspace drama   😶😶😶
I could literally understand the Indian guy insulting at the worker and it was so funny
Store people talked in hindi I know because I'M indian
I bet a whole breed of people will arise doing these same money-making methods.  You’ll see everyone on the streets doing this stuff lol
Did it done it liked it loved it. But try while black. Or even better have a person with no clout and dark skin like myself to try this challenge.
13:27 and there's a spider man chilling in the background
hey btw ryan are you still yusing the same shoes i just wandering if you use the same ones
@3:51    They were arguing about how could she over price you. The man said “how can you do this? Your crazy!”. In Hindi, my language. XD ❤❤ Ryan Trajan is the funniest YouTuber!!! ❤❤😂😂😂❤❤😂
bro you are acculuy amazing at drawing and also i know i cant spell
Bro speed run irl💀
3:55 also, Ryan, if that's the best workplace drama you've experienced, come to India, you'll find way more 😂
This is quite educational for slackers like me
we missed you you're the best most interesting youtuber!❤️
Appeal for the footage of the other attempts here
at 3:37 the shopkeeper said to the girl in hindi "girl are you mad or what?"
hi
Hehe
That store dude is indian and language he is speaking is hindi
Anyone else see airrack in the beginning
The people that were arguing the guy kept saying are u stupid 😂
Dylan aka Brett is the kinda guy to show up to a BYOB party empty-handed, drink everyone else’s beer, then complain about the beer selection 🤡🤡
Dream's luck
Never thought that Ryan is the guy who always wears shorts no matter what. Makes sense though
20 dollars an hour doing a dyi is even better than a professional business at McDonald’s 😂
The shopkeepers Hindi was a surprise I didn't expect!
Omg the lil howdys made me giggle!
Funny how at the end when the camera zooms out its not even above the us
Ahhhh omg he's back!!!!!
It was all just for a glizzy
Morning Routine! :)
BTW the guy in the workplace was talking in Hindi and this is what he said : Are you mad , why are you taking extra money
You gotta pay for the dog walking app you ain’t let us know that 🧐
Oh man thats a indian 🤣🤣 who is arguing
that HINDI speaking guyz at dollar discount
One penny king 🤴
4:39 of the citi bikes are right here nice spelling 😂😂😂
Holy shit this video was fun
No way...
“I want a Glizzy… So Bad” Haha I’m dead 💀
Cross the world 100 days? With penny
4:00 Random Indian argument is over 😂😂, lol!

Ryan is a  man of focus, commitment and sheer will!
If only everyone in NYC was as friendly as Ryan.
I think that the ending hinted at Ryan doing a penny challenge across the world or something right
bro is dream
a
average brown parent scolding their son/daughter 3:35
@3:35 as usual Indian dad scolding their children 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Ah yes new York. In Brazil
Does a Hotdog in NY really cost 10 bucks?
BANGERRRRRR
MY NAME IS NICOLE TOOOO CAN YOU SAY GOOD MORNING NICOLE IN THE NEXT VID OF THIS ACC
bro should start a show of the penny challange
Sitting on the edge of my seat the whole time!
I thought when I saw Airrack, it would be a competition between them on who would get the most money. Either way, this was a great video! 😂👍🏽
20 dollars a hour do this all day and you can make more than walmart employees
500k views, 4.7k comments in just one hour what a legend
uhhah
could you do this in San Fransisco to try to beat your time
Why did he zoom out in south America?
8:33 ALLAH A Muslim cashier
wait new york city is located in the panama canal?!?!!?!
India people in new York Yey😆
Love the vid Ryan
Bro can’t get a new video idea
Next time you should do this but do it for a month and give a penny to someone across the country, maybe like MrBeast or another famous YouTuber
goddamn geo is
👌👌👌👌
Did he spend 10 bucks on a hotdog
I wish i had this much confidence.
Was the ending hinting at a penny challenge around the world?
3:48 he is an Indian guy ❤🧡💛💚
Yes another upload from ryan🎉🎉
me knowing that workplace drama is in hindi- me who knows hindi- he is calling her stupid(or something like that) the other workplace drama was him telling her that she is blind and that the tape was right there
ryan do a dollar challenge around the world start from usa end in japan
thats why u need to carry a pen
He Never Misses To Make Good Content! Keep It Up❤
Just imagine if Tommy appeared at the last second with another clutch $20 bill. “LET’S GO TOMMY!”
It's not a penny challenge without a burger slap and a coffee slurp is it? But the i smiled through the whole video 🤣
i live in new york

I can get 20 water bottles from a regular supermarket in my country
My boy returns in flow baby
Claim your “here before 1 Mil views.
Hi
😂
That is 60 grand a year
legit had to drink 3 bottle of water while watching this 15 min video how....?
realy cool
one thing I love about Ryans movies is they are always so educational and meaningful and funning  unlike others that are only for fun we need more YouTubers like this
My man, can you give the seed for this run?
LETS GOO RYAN
What does howdy mean
Think about how much cardio Preston got
hes back at it again people
He anit lying
Next video: $0.01 international
Ah yes, the any% set-seed penny challenge
You should do this on a normal working day schedule like 9-5 so 8 hours to see how the money compares to an actual job
U jst hav talent confidence level❤
In the first store, the guy called the girl an idiot in hindi lol.
13:27 (Spider-Man 3 song starts playing) 💀
bruv
ok got it, travelling the world with 1 penny incoming (ending)
shopkeepers were actually indians
Crazy how you had 1 million subs 2 years ago, 3 million a few months ago, and now 10M not that much later!!!
The boss at the store spoke Indian. He said “ye kya hain”
The legend returns!
RYAN: HOOWDY
Wait what
I'm not from New Jersey but $20.60 is $20.60
Your back yay
Penny challenge around the world!?!
Your should do one of these in every states most popular city! I know it would take a lot of money and time but it would be so cool!
I love these penny challenges keep them coming.
That dollar store owner sure is something.
me understanding what those indian store workers were saying
20 dollars every hour is actually good
Try doing the 0.01$ challenge in Canada 🇨🇦
The slow walker rng is terrible
If someone tells me they have no job so they’re by the roadside begging…??? 😬well damn!
I love ryan the way you look because he's  the best
the first drawing was crazy ngl
Most intensed video ever😂😂
yessir
me and u would get along super well
Me in the school hallways: 2:49
i was LITTERALY in manhattan last week. i wonder if he was there.
Wtf is airrack here
500k in 1 hour!
Don’t say howdy in nyc, I’ve seen people rage at texans
TODAYS MY BIRTHDAY CAN YOU YOU PLEASE PIN ME??
Only in Ohio
GO TO LONG ISLANDD
early
Lol i saw does when this is 1 hour
I love how the planet just zoomed out from south america 💀
All that for a glizzy, Ryan you’re the best 😂
Lol
As an Indian, I coud tell what that workplace drama means, first he said are you mad and the second thing he said was inaudible
MTA!!!
Try doing it in Chicago
Ryan is willing to do literally anything for vids. This dude is awesome 💙
Appel en peer
Let's see how many subs Ryan will have 5 years from now 🤯
Hello everyone there is a person replying to people here this is a message for then. hey scammer. May God bless you and you can earn money yourself and work hard for it and need not to get innocent people to trust you and you robbing them and destroying peoples fate in humanity. May God help you best of luck
Nice ryan
2:12  Ryan: *telling the guys he's running out of time* Still Ryan: *proceeds to talk to them*
Love your content Ryan I just love it
bro made more than minimum hourly paid workers
The water sellers spoke hindi omg🥸
Hey Ryan, I've been wanting to say this for a while. You are by far my favourite Youtube. All of your videos, and your penny series, it's so inspirational, and seeing your personality warms my heart, you're funny and kind and would love to find someone like you to be a close friend of mine. Thanks for all the content you post Ryan.
Did the daily wordle during this, the word was howdy funny enough
Speedrun
2:39 gmmh HEHEHE made me lose my mind cuz I was laughing too much
Wow In that store they were talking in hindi
Ryan is now a professional speed runner
I missed the last part where that's my problem
Infinite money glitch
3:37 lesss goo hindiii
Penny
That was straight fire would watch again thank you for everything like this if you like Ryan trayhan
13:36 bro drew dream
Typical Indian store right 😂
Something about ryan is that he doesn’t use his school education. But he has good strategies on how to make money, i will say
why do i think of Minecraft speedruns when i watch this lol
It's always a good day when Ryan uploads.
This video seems a little rushed
I love how Ryan Trahan used the NASA recording of the earth at the end of the video, reminds me of the space sounds from all planets that I used to watch.
Can this get 100 likes 😢
yooooooooooooo
Now cross canada
Everytime ryan is laughing it feels like there's phlegm in his lungs.
13:28 the spiderman in the background cracks me up
with Ryan's money making methods you could make up to about 40 dollars an hour possible
Oh goodness here we go again
3:28 he said" pagal hoon tum"  Which means "you are mad"
IM GOING TO NEW YORK TODAy lol I actuaally am
if this was a movie it would legit be my favorite movie.
That last chick was legit offended for a sec. 😂
Next vid is the penny challenge in a minute
Yay finally another one but just speedrun
Howdy😂
Bruh Nicole's caricature looked like dream
here we go again
This has to become an actual speedrun
we need a howdy count XD
13:24 random spiderman just walking in new york city in the background
Of Ryan's next video isn't with Casey Neistat I'm gonna be upset. I'd love to see what happens when those 2 are together since Casey feeds off other people's energy so we'll.
you didnt saw Tom?
Ryan trahan
What if Ryan does a lot of these because he only has one penny
Idea for money making method:  Step 1. Penny for Pen Step 2. Pen for Dollar Step 3. Dollar for Water Step 4. Water for 2 dollars Step 5. 2 dollars for knife Step 6. Find an alleyway Step 7. Partake in less than legal activity Step 8. Profit
Cameraman have to sprint too 😭
Keep it up with the penny challenges! Pls
that part where it zoomed out from earth the place it zoomed out of wasnt even new york
Howdy!
For the any% speed run, you should really make use of the penny duplication glitch
The earth thing at the end Is amazing 🤩
Who thought a youtuber woth 10 mil would be doing this a the new york streets💀
Here before the bots roll in. 😅
f in the chat for katie , no caricature
Ok lil theory here, the reason why it zoomed out to the world is he is gonna do that next with a pennny
4,601
Ryan’s content makes me wanna just travel the world and make money while doing it
After watching this video I am going to greet everyone I see for now on with a "howdy" haha
wow speedran
Return of the king!
bro makes millions of dollars from one penny  😂
COME TO NORFOLK VIRGINIA
Honestly, most normal day in NYC
He multiplied his capital by 2,060 times in one hour. If he kept multiplying  his money in that exponential rate, in 5 hours he would have made $370,967,703,776,000. Stonks
Pin? Lol
I didn’t knew how much I miss this
Good speed run for the penny challenge. You should do this in another major city but sell candy!
why is no one talking about the Indian guy calling the girl pagal 🤣🤣
Thank you Ryan my favorite series out of all YouTube is back!
I like your videos
Ryan's next thing: $0.01 crossing the world!
howdy
LETS GOOoOOoOoOoooOoOOOOO
Enjoyed so much. Different from Challenge, guessing because it was New York. Ryan is especially polite. Rare these days. Store keepers didn't say 'Thank you' or 'have a nice a day' The world needs more Ryan! Thank you for the video! ❤
I was exactly where he is
13:28 spiderman
I'm literally in New York right now
Am I the only one who got scared from the sudden ✨EARTH✨ at the end💀
so thats why i say ryan at Dylan Lemay ice cream shop
hmm was the end a hint of travelling the world on 1 penny? 👀
$20.60 is possible for a living if you can keep that up -Mev
did ryan know he was in an indian or pakistani store
Ryan should make a video where he starts with 1 penny however he can’t use his phone, so no food deliveries, money transfers etc. Iike if you agree
Does anyone know what the music at the beginning is called?
The video I've ever seen
Don’t go on the subway!
The man at store was an indian🇮🇳 wow!
Hi sorry I am sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo late
I think Ryan needs to do the penny challenge in London next. I could see that being absolutely hysterical.
Why does he keep saying hawdey
Is the ending signaling that he’s going to space or doing the penny challenge around the world?
Ah shit here we go again
Ryan Penny challange is one of my favorites all the stuff he does for us
Hey, Ryan you should do the imposter series, we loved it!!!
Next time come to Brooklyn (best borough bias is very much here)
Ryan's drawing  skills are getting better though
New series idea 1penny challenge in ever state.
W for the cameraman LOL
Haters will say this series is milked, it's not
WOW RYAN TRAHAN IS BACK WITH another penny challenge?     No hate Ryan ❤️
Im to shy for all this😅
RYANNNNNN YOU SHOUKD TRY TO MAKE A DOCUMENTARY AND A PENNY CHALLENGE LIKE ON NETFLIX OR SOMTHING… Any way does the howdy king reply?
Ya
Ryan the guy of to shove a glizzy down after a hard day of work
yessssss im hereeee
I love you
56k
we need an unedited version of these
One penny challenge around the world?. 😂🎉
do the penny challenge again but you can't go to any of the states that you have already done.
I just love how hes drawing Dylan theres a spider man in the background
13:28 did anyone else see Spider-Man in the background
The earth at the end be looking like a egg
biggest fan to Ryan love you so much dude
Indian shop 🙂
$10 for a hotdog. Only in New York
Ryan I literally love all of your videos keeping me entertained
Bro is on a roll on his posting right now
Great video
OMG
My guy is a machine
It’s kinda harder in New York City because everything is higher priced
Me: How embarrassing do you want to be Him: Yes
I loved that!!
Bro the recent comments are like 2 seconds ago😮
Awesome video bro!! Missed these uploads, keep it up man😁
Spoiler as to how much he makes     Technically he made over minimum wage while being self employed
W
Anyone noticed the word पागल 😀
u are incredible
this guy is milking this series so much
bro gained more than avg italian worker in an hour
We need "spending a week in new york with only 1 cents"
in indonesia you could get 15 litre of water like only for only 2 dollar
Geez, he got 500k views in 1 hour.
The first shop where he baught water was owned by Indians
hi
the ending gave me a heart attack
3:14 Is there polish water in america? Wow I thought that nooone knows about poland in america
*Dig down straight to find emeralds*
You couldn't do this if you didn't have a bank account and smart phone...
2 mins
13:28 spidey behind him
Nah Ryan is such a legend ye carrys yt at this point
They where calling that girl stupid in indian
3:48 Never expected to see such Indian thing in NY
i dont think people noticed but the shop where he buys 3 water bottles from was an indian shop and the shop owner call the lady at the counter who calculated the bill wrong "paagal ho kya tum?"(i.e., "are u mad?" in hindi)😂 edit: Love ya Ryan<3
Dylan is my name!!!
15:13 *TWO* NY hot dog     P/s: Katie is so good
I love your video I love you ryan
he spawned on a decent seed ngl
15:19 o m g  look at the right that game is destroy all humans i used to play so much of it on og xbox oh man
Did anyone else see the spiderman in the background here 13:27
the standing cartoon drawing is pretty epic , ryan rocks
Ok but 10 dollars for a hot dog is crazy
eahhaha
“She looks like she’s from paranormal activity” Ryan, ur the best way 😂❤
In my notifications I better see “I travel across the world with 1 penny” in the next 3 months or I’ll kidnap your dog
Epic.
let's get it!
ryan you should cross the world starting with one cent
Ryan just slays
Dang that hot dog was $10? New York moment
Feels like the 31 day Penny challenge all over in one video😁
I love how the man spoke in Hindi when the girl was charging extra
I was in New York like 13 days after this video was posted
The Indian at the beginning are to funny
I feel like if I saw Ryan I'm probably less awkward then him lol
Ryan's next video: "I travelled across the multiverse with one cent in 30 days."
this is more of a "how many times can i say howdy" speedrun
13:20 Haha i love this guy
There is no way he is teasing what i think he's teasing....
that survival video was kinda better tbh, but this is also insane!
8:25 INDIAN
bruh
Let’s go Tommy
so good
The Indian water bottle store drama
Bruv you need to live off a $0.01 for three days in New York city. I recommend trying to live in a major city in every state for at least three days
at 3:35 man was speaking hindi
Bro went ZA WARDO at the outro
20$/hr side hustle lesson of the day: Get a job
the one guy who didn’t donate is not the vibe… you don’t have 50 cents ?
i think if you would just have done more uber eats
howdy
3:45 the indian guys.....same evrywhere XD
I could make so much bringing stuff from a cheaper place to sell stuff to new york
How can you slay it all over againnn 😭
Ryan it’s hard to try too sell people stuff when ur in NY it’s  filled with scammers especially time square
When Ryan's camera person gets a gimbal camera stabilizer the game is gonna be thoroughly changed
aaaaaaaaaaaaaa!
Ryan that Guy was an Indian who saved u 75 cents and just told that women that she was crazy adding up the extra charges😂 I was shocked hearing a native language in your video but it just felt wholesome... He has a store in NYC is crazy...
Imagine if he makes surviving on a penny challenge around the world
Imagine being in NYC and seeing a guy run through the streets with some camera guy chasing him 💀
This is halarious I was in the square yesterday
Wait did he zoom out of South America at the end ?
3:36 They're Indians, thats the reason they're so kind
We need the ice coffee
New york is probably the worst city to do this in lol everything there is expensive and the people suck
New Yorkans are just a different breed 💀
This man just gets money when he wants it
You should do a another one cent challenge but you go to every state in the US. Love your videos Ryan! 👍😄
Are those Indians selling because they were talking in Hindi?
Hey Ryan
3:31 heyyy i found an Indian there!😂 He said "are pagal ho tum" Means have you lost your mind?
this man is sheer vibes dude.
The short version of the Penny sega
Hiiii
What one more new penny challenge 😃😃
yasssss more 1 penny stufff
His laughter is contagious , it’s amazing !
Dude got a lucky seed.
Ryan i gonna call you penny master
This the goat
Sometimes i feel sad.... then i realise that,          This is a penny and im-
That’s so cool!!! Your videos are amazing!!! Thank you!
Ryan just made the normal wage in one hour
Who else watched him before the penny challenge
You should do a trip around the world starting with 1 penny
U got the water bottles for 1.95 cus the sellers were Indian aka the haggling expert 😎
3:35 he is saying that is she crazy in hindi i think in (not trying to be mean or something .-.)
4401th
I speedran the video of speedran video
Howdy
I'm indian I could understand everything the indian dude said to the cashier it made it so much funnier
😃😃😃
My man really had to give me an existencial crisis with the ending of the vid😮‍💨😂
Who noticed that the store woman and man at the store were Indians😂
running out of ideas huh
The owner of shop speak Hindi . I am from India .It is very happy to see Indians in foreign . 😍😍
POV you have the same wallpaper as Ryan 💀💀
Ok
It’s New York don’t say “howdy” to everyone on the street 😂😂
He’s so wholesome-but I have to tell you that in NY, when we hear the word glizzy, we think you mean a gun  😂
You're gonna look back on your haircut and cringe.
Hi
You better like our city :>
3:39 "Tum kya pagal ho kya" "Ha"
My introvert arse would never
you really like pennies don't you?
lets appreciate how good ryan is at drawing
Speedrun ok?
3:40 that shopkeeper is Indian and he is saying her "how tf did u put 0.75$"
Moreeee
Please make a new series
All right…now the next challenge would be to go to Europe and do a penny challenge. Lol
I was waiting for Mc donalds 🤣
Hey Commenters I have a question if anyone can answer.  How do I have 2 names? On Display it's RollyAV but inside its HoneyCreeper.  If your mind is blown🤯, Consider Subscribing or just leave a like on this comment. I'm going through hard time.
do you guys realize that this dude made more than minimum wage doing this challenge
So that means you make 20 dollars an hour...
What's a speedran
✨PRESTON IS A LEGEND✨
RYAN
Funfact the shop  he bought water bottle was Indian
Do u check these comments?
Bro milked this series dry
I think speedran in every state would be a great.
Him and his pennies man
Yoo Rayan wassap
8:09 Indian
Ryan is my favorite YouTuber he so sweet and entertaining😍, and caricatures were so funny 😂
The water bottle store was speaking hindi
He should get Guinness  or something not only for this but also for all the awesome things he's done.
Awesome video👌
youre so funny
Broo u need to cross the world with a penny sometime in future we all would love it ;)
I’ve never seen someone so happy for 2 dollars 😂
There needs to be a second „season“ of the Penny Series! The series was one of the best ever made on YouTube. Keep it up Ryan!
WE MISS YOU!!! Make more content ;D
That shop owner was Indian and was speaking hindi
3:37 I speak his language and he said that your crazy
I’m not sure but ryan is saying howdy a lot here
It might have not been possible if it wasn’t for Katie
He is back again!!
3:35 here the shopkeeper used Hindi word are pagal INDIANS ARE ALSO IN NEW YORK BABY💜💜🤓🤓
“I feel like Casey Neistat. It feels really uncoordinated” 💀💀💀
Ryan your videos make me soooooooo happy all the penny ones are my favorite I would love to see more❤
“I’m gunna go deliver a food” - Ryan Trahan
Here we go again
The ending though. Is it hinting at another penny challenge?
Being an indian we understood that shopkeeper 😂
It's like he's in a video game where he has killed the ender dragon some times and now speed running coz he's kinda pro.
13:28 Spider-Man walking in the backround 😂😂
Haha that was so good! Possibly my fav video from you!
not bad
Brooo........ The water bottle seller was a indian.... 🇮🇳🇮🇳
Why do you have Airrack in every video intro?
tht indians arguing 😆😆this will never stop in any country
Howdy !
The indian person tho😂😂
Did any1 notice airrack..
Can you do it in Amsterdam
YOOOOOOOOOO 0.01 AGAINNNNN
*pennies.*
Nobody: Ryan: 🤠
Nice
"Your bun is adorable".. what do you mean by that?🤔
I must say Ryan I am impressed it seems difficult to do that in New York City but I feel there’s a greater challenge my city Philadelphia the reason it may be a greater challenge is that nobody wants to talk to anybody in Philadelphia while New York has the occasional nice person I challenge you to do this challenge in Philadelphia and I will do it with you if you may choose let me know!
Menace is back with the peni- I mean, Penny.
Hi
Ryan why u didn't ride there straight after the Uber delivery then drop the bike off?
The best series ever
No body literally no one  Ryan's editor:- new york is in peru
imagine ryan doing a penny series to conquer the world, i mean travel araound the world.
Can you do this but with every state, and maybe just everywhere around the world?
I LOVE YOU MAN!
Bruh ryan
I just laugh so hard at the workplace  drama cause I can completely relate to that as living in India
imagine randomly ordering food online and Ryan comes to deliver it 😂😂
LETS GOO
Bro made 450 dollars in one hour from views
I hope you see this but probably not, honey is selling your personal data. How do you think that they can sponsor all these people? There are hundreds of videos about this.
*workplace drama*
i actually love dylan/brett hes so funny
I would love to se the penny Challenge but in  Europe
👋 hi
@Ryan Trahan i translated it 3:35 means he said are you crazy in hindi or have you gone mad
I was right where Ryan was last week
ryan would be a successful drug addict
3:05 lol pagal
Bruh
Penny challenge should be on netflix
3:40 bruh i understand what the man is calling the woman a dumass because he did the calculations
I’m in new york
that indian store guy went crazy on her daughter
Wait, after the penny is banned in the US… what about other continents?
Hello
Whats with the earth shot at the end? Are we being teased a world penny challenge?   I think a 2 person penny challenge would be good to but they have to be as ambitious as Ryan.
The world place drama was in hindi and at 3:36  that say pagal ho kya tum that means are you gone mad
This made me so happy this morning. 🙏💕
i really missed the penny series🥲
Lol another banger
This is awesome!!! Ive never been able to see any of your penny videos, they are awesome!!
That dylan guy was more nervous and tensed than ryan for some reason lol
Oh shit, was that ending a teaser for the next series... Cross-Global 1penny challenge
i love these videos
ryan and penny challenge make the best duo!!!
10$ FOR A HOTDOG??
He definitely could do better imo. Should do a similar thing but spend 24 hours making as much as he can.
Imagine having a video out for thirty minutes and having 40k likes
"kutte pagal ho tum" 🤣
God loves u have a great day!!
Nice
I was waiting for Airrack tho. I thought he will be on the video
Hi love ya vids man I dare you to pin my comment so everybody can see how hard you work And the people should subscribe
I think he might do an around the world penny challenge as he teased it at the end with the Earth.🌎
Kid named penny
He should do this in London and see what happens there
I love how Ryan spent 7 hours recording 7 different speedruns just to find the most entertaining one for us to watch. Absolute legend.
lol that shopkeeper was scolding that girl in hindi
thanks ryan this is amazing. u brighten my day
3:35 tum pagal ho 😂 Indian
I remember evey day I used to come to school and watch his 30 days one Lennie challenge
Fun part was that Indian Guy Of That discount store. 😂😂😂. He was scolding his worker in Hindi who was too an Indian 😂😂
Ryan bought water bottles from the best bargainers INDIANS 😂
13:27 WE JUST GONNA IGNORE SPIDER MAN!? 😭
Why are his video so good 😩
Good Morning Sleepyheads…
1 hour ago, nice
Ryan is so social damn
I feel like he should do this in every major city in all 50 states. That would be a dope series.
At 03:51 The owner scolding the cashier girl in typical Hindi
Indian uncle is shop keeper 🤔
this video made made me smile........thank you for making this!!
I saw this man running but I was so happy that I didn't say hi😭hi Ryan
3:34 he is an Indian guy🤣🤣❤️
I would have ask the camera man to lend me some bucks$
He finally got a good seed
The things we do on Earth.
This is so anxiety inducing wtf
The guy Indian guy in the store was really funny.
this feels more than 15 min
Mad respect for Ryan doing it even though the man wasn't gonna pay
2:50 at the grocery store is My worst social nightmare.
I really love the awkwardness
THIS IS A PENNY
We need a speedrun category for this
"Okay so today we are going to continue to beat this dead horse for another video"
Literally started watching Ryan during his penny series and now I can’t stop. His attitude and kindness is what we need in this world. Thank you Ryan
Honestly tho, these people could resell these caricatures and make some money off it 😂
rayn is so sweet to other people!🤣🤣🤣
Dylan/Brett looks like he's getting ready for a race
Dude. This video was uploaded 56 mins ago and you have 400k views. Damn
Yey I love pennys
3:36 lol they were Indians and i understood what they said haha
Can you try penny speedrun in Norway lol
My morning routine is back
Indian in ryan videos
Ryan in this vid be like : I am gona show you what life is in 60 minutes
What i have noticed is that Ryan is much more social after the Penny Challenge you can Just See how much more confident He is while talking Look at him growing
OOF for the camera man lol
Bro is just casually saying “howdy” as if it isn’t todays wordle
KEEP KILLING IT RY
Vennessa Actually Looks Beautiful.
Imagine working an under minimum wage job when you can just draw people in 60 seconds and make more
you have no idea how much i like this <3!!!
he is too good at this challenge that he speedrun it
Nice
Early gang 👇
I felt so much emotion when you started drawing these people...

1 hour gang :)
4k
Gotta love workplace drama
bro got the best speedrun seed
Only Indian can understand the store drama
Bet this man can survive in the most expensive city on earth with 1 penny
Hi
What if you did the 30 day one penny challenge in the winter thoughts?????
Ryan is the definition of investing and selling                                                  Give me 1 explanation of why you scrolled here
i love love love this guy!
You should do a speed run in Toronto, Ontario
GOOD VID
Why did I think this was going to be a series
You should do the same thing but a day
The bottle seller was an indian
You should do one where you see how quickly you can get to like 100 dollars or something
Scolding in Hindi
First time being early :0
The owner saying pagal ho gayi hogaya kya is one of the most spoken dialogue by Indian men 😅😅
I can’t wait for crossing the world with 1 penny 😂
Is Ryan doing the penny challenge around the world?
Indian shop
RYAN THESE SERIES MEANS A LOT TO US...........AND WE ABSOLUTELY LOVE AND APPRECIATE  THIS!!!
Was it just me that saw Airrack at the start walking in the crowd?
i think next year he is going to do it around the world
Yes.
You should do a long penny challenge with hailey
Lol that girl in the shop was a mess.
Ryan didn’t realize their was a camera in the elevator
I am from san Antonio
8:25 he is Indian /Pakistani I guess
Hi
400k+ Views in an hour, what a madman
I like how at the convenience store the guy yelled "are you crazy" at her and ryan's just like "shes nice to me" when shes trying to charge him over 😂
Why airrack
Btw that was an Indian shop you bought the bottles from
DREAM????
okay
Was the last part a sequel to him doing the challenge to go around the world?
Ryan always makes great videos👏
20$ an hour is more than my dad gets
Where did that comment go
HAPPY LATE BIRTHDAY RYAN!!!!!!
It’s too hard to challenge 😂
the shopkeeper was indian
Bruh Ryan got the dream luck😂
I think this also means he is going to speedrun eating McDonald's too.
So this is what all your running had been training for
Ryan trahan penny across the world challenge
Please come to Brooklyn ;(
Another fantastic Ryan video
Nice ending though
Lmao the dollar dtore owner was indian
Epic

This is about to go crazy with my morning donut and coffee
SPEEDRUN OOGA BOOGA BOOGA *dream music moment*
Another w

*clints down* Katie : for what? Ryan : oh idk 😭😭
HAHAH THE INDIAN CASHIERS ARGUING LMAOO
In my opinion this is a great guy and he's is a funny guy.
6:50 💀
I will always carry a spare $20 bill on me incase i encounter ryan in my hometown
11:13 lol
03:35 He's Indian, he is basically saying are you mad or what
The ending?
kya tum pagal ho kyaa?😂😂😂
can you pin this fish 🐟
Bro your art style is sick!!!!
Bro made more money then most in a hour
3:35 pagal 😵😵😵
Thanks for reminding me we’re all stranded on earth, after an extremely wholesome video.
OMG I JUST READ THE CAPTION AND IM ABOUT TO WATCH IT BEEN WAITING FOR ANOTHER 1
Finally another thing related to pennies
Ryan you should come to Delaware to speedrun they have no taxes
Idk how he comes up with so many different ideas. Either way all of them are good
if i saw ryan on the streets, he would be in the minority of  youtubers i would trust to be legitimately happy to say hello to a fan
3:34 It's good to se that indian perents are the same regardless of the country they live in. 😆
Ryan looks like he has too pee like 24/7
Glad your doing stuff like this again
Wait wait.. is he going to cross the world with one penny?😮😮😮
Impossible!!!!! He must be using cheats to complete this run
Pin me, you won't.
Maybe Ryan could travel Europe with a penny
This man will never stop saying howdy
i loved this vid
Nice fucked up arm in the thumbnail
I somehow haven't seen anyone point out the ending of the video where it zooms out on the Earth, implying that he's gonna do the penny challenge across the globe 👀
i have a feeling we're gonna be seeing a penny challenge around the world soon
Now come out to Westchester
1:05 Ryan she don't know what NPC means.
.
That was awesome.
Dr Mike reacted to your videos
DU DU DU DU
that indian guy in discount store caught me....always a great video🚀
8:27 did anyone noticed that the shopkeeper was Indian😂❤️
Legend says Ryan is still in New York
Nicole loked like dream face reveal

Wow again let’s gooooo
YAY 1 PENNY I watched every 1 penny challenge vid u posted
HOWDYYYYYY! MY MAN DOES IT AGAIN!
props to preston for running everytime ryan does AHAHA
Glad he’s back
How is it day to night in one hour? HMMMMM.. 🤔🤔🤔
What I have noticed with Ryan is he’s not socially awkward he’s awkwardly social 😂😂
When Ryan did the penny series it honestly just made my day
A legend has returned
omg
go to cincinnati next, less crowded but you get money
The situations Ryan gets into, my anxiety could never…
Whats crazy is that he made his first penny challenge at like 346K and now he's making them at 10.7 million How fast he's growing is crazy
Holy shit every single one of this guys videos is literally insane good stuff
Anyone from india  Have you noticed that the water selling guy is speaking hindi
He is becoming a pro at this😂
Great video like always!!!
hello
hey ryan ! you should change the thumbnail, it's way to bright
So... is Ryan foreshadowing a worldwide penny challenge with that ending?
I didn't choose to watch this i had auto play on and made me watch this. And now i want more
ryan is ultimately just a good guy ❤
ga ga goo-ga. video ban. I'm disliking now
Next video: I survived space with $0.01
14:39 dream face reveal typa chin
Indian shop keeper😭😂😂
How do u stay sane
3:30 an Indian store.... Awesome vid
The video teaches us that you can do anything as till u male money
it’s back let’s go
Try 446: I did it in 0.01 of a second
man ive never watched Ryans videos before but damn i love him already, hes got this funny little charm where he seems like hes socially awkward but hes super extroverted and polite, the laughing as he runs, the howdys as he passes people, talking to everyone as he goes....everyone in New York is probably thinking "wtf has this tourist been smoking"
Next India?
I like your videos keep it up ❤❤
Howdy
That guy in the supermarket was scolding the girl in Hind
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

pov: you can understand what the dollar store worker are saying when they’re talking in another language
You getting better at sketching
SHEEESH
Teaches us You can do anything and still make money
Can't lie but Ryan's penny series has brought such a different type of style of content on YouTube that each and every single day, we had that excitement to watch the other episode coming and coming and not knowing what's next. Brought such a good aura into YouTube
Ryhan tran

Cameramen gigachad
If I got a penny every time he said howdy in this video I would be a billionaire 😂
Imagine his final video on YouTube is crossing the world in 90 days
You really should invest in a gimbal or steady cam for running scenes
This guy is hardcore, we're watching attempt 7 guys!
Ryan is the best!
Yeah poland springs
I love how he’s always worried about getting hit by a car although it gives me this bad impression about New York road safety 😂😂
Love this
Nice
Feels good watching this video within less than an hour since it was posted.
RYAN SAID 1 penny vs the world at the end
love ur vids ryan
The India workplace drama😂😂

S
The Indian store owner was epic 😂
man is built different
3:36 that guy was speaking hindi..LOL he scolded her saying pagal ho kya which means are u dumb LOL
At 8:25 the shopkeeper said 1) "Yaha pe to tape tha" 2) "Ye kya hai?" Which translates to  1) I've seen some tape over here **Finds it** 2) What is this? **Points towards tape**
This series has gone to show, “Anyone can be successful from $0.01”
Can't lie but Ryan's penny series has brought such a different type of style of content on YouTube that each and every single day, we had that excitement to watch the other episode coming and coming and not knowing what's next. Brought such a good aura into YouTube
14:41 dream?! 🥺
King
Still waiting for the 1 year penny challenge 🙃
the gujju uncle was out of box >_<
What I have noticed with Ryan is he’s not socially awkward he’s awkwardly social 😂😂

You should do this in the uk
3:38 I understood exaactly what they said
I always enjoy watching people make a living off of a single pen
This video is insane
I love these penny challenges, they’re so fun. They always bring a smile to my face :)
Your content is never disappointing ❤️❤️✌️
I feel like you would have made more from deliveries than doing “artwork” but it was entertaining.
I’m here
*Workplace drama*
I really enjoyed it
Speed run going across America starting with a Penney but only in 15 days with no great resets
Ryan keeps coughing
that Indian guy 😆😆
howdy
You should really do this in New Orleans the city is a different vibe and I think you would get a cool take on the challange
Tommy did it too but for a week 😂😂😂
Can you make way more penny
im just tryna wonder what type of hotdog is 10 bucks
That store guy is indian
14:17 San Antonio family
This is what perfection is

5:49 its a grid my guy
My Ryan working overtime ... just so he can buy a NY glizzy. Ain't that wholesome AF?
Love this video Ryan! 😁
next video idea: roll a penny into oncoming traffic, chase after it, then claim compensation.
3:35 hindiii ...love frommm INDIA
Ryan is the life  prove that everything is possible you just got to figth for it.
At this point, I don’t even think that a penny is equal to a penny. Ryan makes me think that it is worth over a million…
You buy water bottle from an Indian bro. I wish I was there but now I'm again in India.
I like the guy who's names Brett but he calls himself Dylan "for FUN"
WOW so cool great job
8:27 that guy literally spoken hindi
😃😃😃😃😎😎😎😎😎
I live in NY! oh and 3,455th person! never let them know your next move ; )

That was amazing 😂 I laughed so hard

3:35 is it just me or he is saying ' Tum pagal ho gayi ho?'
As someone who lives in the midwest, when you say "Have a good day" and someone replies with "ok" it makes you feel sad
Very good video!!!
He’s really milking the one penny challenge
03:36 he is definitely the father and she is the least likable one lol
yeahhh
Brotha got scammed $10 for a hotdog gadamn
Is this foreshadowing for the next video where he goes to space 🧐🧐
hi
Me who was binge watching his videos last night me wonder Inv his next uploads   Bam new video
Bro 3:23 woman ☕️
I’m just imagining this becoming a speedrunning category for twitch livestreams…  “Come watch me beat my PB” 🤣
4:56 he will surely die. any tourist that uses those, die.
I Love Ryan
New York is the perfect place for your videos!!😊
I know
Imagine the next penny challenge is 80 days around the world starting with a penny
nice
Will you please post the other attempts on the 2nd Chanel?
3:36 that indian guy😂😂😂
hi am your BIG's fun   i hope  you hit it sorry abot my grammar
Somebody put a counter of how many times Ryan said "Howdy" in this video.
.
Ryan in like 10 years is going to make a video about how he bought the world with a single penny And his first decree as the ruler of the world would be that all types of currency is banned, except the penny.
Ryan i love watching your vidoes
Love you’re videos
The shopkeeper spoke hindi bro

Ryan
Ryan is the most funniest YouTuber
Please learn me the ability to not be awkward
that cashier girl was about to get fired 💀
Ryan’s laugh is so infectious!

Holy
If he did BLJs and clipped through the walls of the stores and used them to travel faster, he would have saved thousands of frames. But this is a very new catagory.

YES AGAIN YES I WANT TO START AGAIN YESSSSSS
ryan new challenge : i am gonna be traveling across the world with a penny in a year
Early
3:36 indian man come.. Pagal ho tum 😂 Country doesn't matter when shoppwoner is 🇮🇳
I speedrun being broke my like is 3min end 14 sec end I am broke now
This is the greatest speed run ever.
Imagine ordering some food on uber eats and Ryan trahan showing up at your door saying howdy.
Keep it up the good work man..we all here to support you man
15:18/ I have said I have  comment Corssing USA and I said after series can you cross the world and daily videos and in this video at the end ........ ... ..... .. ? ????!!!!!!! 15:18
I love how he always starts with a pen
Ryan’s pennie challenge really made me realize how great of a country America is. You can start with nothing and rise to travel anywhere you want while still making a “standard of living.”
Cool
omg katie is so pretty im melting
POV u dont know what to comment but u hope it gets alot of liked
YOU PENNY SERIES SHALL GO FOREVER
You should upload the raw hour for validity so people can actually compete on this speed run lol
20 per hour is insane
Eee
Hey Ryan i know you wont see this but try a speedrun in Boston MA
we ant more of this penny challanges
hi
😂😂😂love these videos
Wow your grinding on youtube
I love how polite Ryan is, even if people answer with attitude or downright rudeness, he just takes it in his stride.
w-what was on those peoples t-shirts?🤔🤔
Bro made 20 bucks in 10 minutes (the first 50 min went in preparation) If only he had started with 10 bucks just making these pictures, he could have made himself $100+
Since comments are going so fast, no one will know I just ate grass.
40 min!
*zooms out from south america*
Bro this man is crazy and fun
3:34 It is an indian store and the guy said tum pagal ho kya that means are you dumb
Howdy
Love your videos
38mins
fart poo
the water bottle sellers were Indians or pakistani
Ryan has had a great social confidence boost since the first penny challenge!
39m early
Yes
I’m happy he did this
Wait! It's 10 Dollars for a hotdog   that's crazy
E
I miss the burrito. And the McDonald's coffee 😭
I'll be honest, I'm way too socially awkward to try this 😂💔
This is the exact same thing as “BRO I GOT THE BEST SEED GENERATION IN MY MINECRAFT SPEEDRUN”
Ryan:- *breathes* howdy
Honestly the thing I respect the most is the transparency. He literally mentioned out of the gate that he had done 7 other attempts.
Do crossing the entire earth with 1 penny
You try to do an hour in cleveland pls
I can’t watch this man anymore he says howdy to much
What I have noticed with ryan is he’s not socially awkward he’s awkwardly social😂
15:18/ I have said I have  comment Corssing USA and I said after series can you cross the world and daily videos and in this video at the end ........ ... ..... .. ? ???? 15:18
Who else loves Ryan and his penny series?!🔥 👇
that "howdy" always hits different lmao
Damn man is dream
dream be like:
do a penny challenge but instead of the us do canada
E
Any one see the fat spiderman in the baground 😂😂
You should go from usa to Japan starting from one penny
I feel like Ryan is so out of place when he is saying howdy in NYC
Best
9:27 This Is The Most Ryan Trahan Purchase I've Ever Seen XD
I SWEAR I SAW SPIDERMAN SOMEWHERE IN THERE
3:40 the guy was indian he said "pagal" which means crazy😂😂😂😂
I loved this series!
Hii
Luck was 1 in 7.5 billion
ee
Wow Ryan always with insane content and yiu arent that bad at caricutures or however you spell them.
WOW oh well, GG's
Bro did he went on every state uncluding ohio
You just feel the boost of confidence of ryan unlike before when he was still akward
This is basically Ryan getting money for doing physical activities
ryan in new york is the best
Bread 🥖
I honestly miss the series in June because i watched it everyday and subscribed to you and started watching it when it was Episode 3, i honestly miss this series cause i spent 1 entire month of my summer break watching every single episode.
HE'S BACK
Howdy
IM EARLY BY 30 MIIINNN
Ryans content is the originality YouTube needs nowadays. So many channels with the same content...Ryans is like the eye in the storm.
hola soy arahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh oop but anyways i love you're content😊😊
Got the right seed.
Early 👇
He is a very unique YouTuber I love him so much because of that he is going to beat the YouTube subscriber count

Is the world zoom out hint at him traveling the wold with one penny
at the end when he says"all the hustle and bu-" then zooms out to the world.idk if its just me or why do i feel like hes going to do an accross the world one
3:36 that man told to the girl "Are you mad?"
Every time yo talk to Preston I think you are talking to me.
3:00 shop owner is indian he speak hindi
Ryannnnnnnn’s BACK!!!!
Ryan's life flashed before his eyes on that first loss. Rock paper scissors is intense
Thank you for making my life better.
Am I the only one that thinks the final is a foreshadowing for a around the world penny series?
So food
now is time to wait for everyone else doing this challenge
Eat the penny 😊
It's a different vibe to hear mu mother tounge in ryan's video
ryan was walking here  edit: i am from long island so am i i new yorker???
.
“Pen girl laughing”
Good Job Ryan La❤
2 dollars for 3 waters?
Some love for nyc!!
Hi
cLAim yOuR 1 hOur tIcKeT hEre
This video is goign to break youtube
to the one % of people reading this  just have a good day
Great vid
I love ryan
i love these videos so much, you meet so much nice people!! im glad you got that glizzy at the end
POV when I see the thumbnail: Eyes opened  Jaw doped  Mouth opened Brain froze  Dream speed run Views
hi ryan do the penny challenge again but whit speed run
The amount of times that he has done this, is insane
Im wondering how much McDonalds does he get
i could never do this becuse it is very akward to talk with strangers.
Great job! I love penny challenge videos so much. It's also super nice yet exciting to see the usual money-making methods condensed into such a short amount of time. An hour is crazy! Great stuff, Ryan. Hope that hotdog was nice! 🌭 👍
9:26 what was on that guys shirt?
Hi😊
I honestly feel like his next challenge should represent crossing the whole world with one penny.
6:23 stay for another month and you’ll change your mind
Well, okay!
Was that Preston!!!
And so it begins again....THE ONE, THE ONLY *P E N N Y*
Yes he is
Epic
The caricature conversation that Ryan starts is genius because it makes the customers feel worse about rejecting Ryan’s art.
Your caricatures have become so good!
Running out of money? Go out into a very populated area and start being awkward in public, then draw a bunch of people for a cheap price Lul
Hey Ryan which vanilla iced coffee do you buy like latte or what
Here before viral
AMAZING VIDEO ur my inspiration and keep doing amazing vids like this
the day will come where ryan is going around the world starting with a penny!!

this comment was made 29 minutes after this video was uploaded to the website youtube at 7:35AM 10/9/2022
Early
Next idea: I crossed earth to give TommyInnit a penny. Same rules as the one to give MrBeast a giant penny but, it's a 60 day time limit.
This is sick

New York City is a big city. I have to agree.
I dubble dog dare you to pin this
Ryan pls do another penny challenge
Before I watch the video, I've got to say.  I love the thumbnail!
He also made 20 dollars in 10 minutes with his characatures  That’s almost 1000 dollars a day in an 8 hour work day
he stated at one penny crazy
Next challenge, crossing the world in 90 days from a penny
PLEASE RELEASE THE OTHER ATTEMPTS AHH
lets see a day
Where was the McDonalds tradition?
The manager of the workplace wearing a shirt was an indian for sure ... he spoke hindi with his employees indiansvare every where 😂😂
Is the ending hinting in going around the world with the penny?
I have another idea go across Asia please
“Hey guys I got two dollars!”🤣

The power of the Penny
More than minimum wage. Can’t complain 🤷‍♂️

E
I just watched the original.01 videos and I loved it! It was so emotional when you finished out!

SO EARLY 2 MIN AGO
0 hour gang where you at
3:37 as a pakistani, i can translate what the guy said into english as "come on! you are crazy, ah?
Imagine if he met HJ Evelyn?!?!
well this was amazing! Congo on the glizzy!!
Milk
The workplace drama was crazy!!!!!
Bro Ryan has really changed the type of content in a good way of course. The fact that this took 7 tries is sad but still his kind of enthusiasm while doing the challenge really makes me smile
man started a new trend
Bro wtf
The Indian Hindi banter in the shop only Indians can relate
You need to build a house in the Amazon rainforest but have somebody already build it for you and see if you can survive 24 hours
Not again
His laugh is so awkward it’s funny
Ye
Yo Vanessa was in the show too hot to handle
Nyc is not in the panama canal

and the drama is normal in india broh🙂
chicken sandwich
You should try that in other states too!
Holy
The end 💀
did ryan buy a hotdog for 10 dollars or what
There is none holy as the LORD: For there is none beside thee: Neither is there any rock like our God. 1 Samuel 2:2 KJV
The ending will you travel the globe with 1 penny ;) Idk it seems impossible but really good wideo :)
His penny challeges hit diffrent
i would think this challenge would be easy until i remembered that not everyone know who ryan is
Cool ig
shart fart dart
That last Drawing do be looking like Dream
That Guy was speaking Urdu 😂 and he Said how Can u over charge him when it's not the price
The 3 dollar sodas were pretty profitable but probably wouldn't work in NYC
That water bottle store owner was indian
“I never once stepped foot in New York City”  Proceeds to highlight every part of New York except the city
loved this!!! very funny
The shop that you brought water is indian.
That 30 day ending was emotional for me though🙂
This dude speed running life lmao

His  videos just keep getting better
Hello
What an incredible video. How it notes that you are the inventor of the penny challenge.
Wait… Does the earth at the end mean hes gonna do a penny challenge around the world???
I hope the earth at the end of the video means he might do some kind of “penny across the world” challenge
Dis so cool I wanna go there someday
Ryans penny challenges is so interresting
That was entertainment at its finest
Love u
It’s funny how awkward it is in New York to say “howdy”😂

this is just a suggestion how about a $0.01 Challenge where are you have to visit every state and to make it interesting you cannot visit the same state twice
Ryan winning just because of good zoning
Pagal ho tum 😂
That's the reason mrbreast said that he would be the next one to pass 100mill on YouTube.

3:36 the guy said in Hindi "Tum pagal ho" which means you're mad to the girl🤣🤣😅
Wtf was that ending? Traveling the world with a penny 2023!?

Ryan your one of my favorite youtuber your amazing
It takes some YouTubers 1 day to get 100 dollars with a penny and it takes ryan 1 hour to make 20 do the math
The detail the editor put into speeding up the timer at the end when you guys are counting down was unnecessary but a nice addition haha
Ryan is such a great YouTuber
it's not a speedrun without the dream speedrun music
Here before famous
Your my fav yt
v

I want to see what happens behind the scenes 🇯🇲😄😄
The guy in the water bottle store was scolding her Lmao I understood everything he said
That's very nice, so if in an hour you can do 20 dollars, so in a day it would be (Daily) 480 dollars (Weekly) 3.360 dollars (Monthly) 13.440 (in a year) 161.280 That's really nice!
haha speedrun go brrr
EARLY
Ryan Keep the the good work up, and I’m soooo happy that this video got 2.4k comments in 24 min
I was laughing when he was making his poster on the sidewalk while doing a brand deal that probably paid 25k+
Ryna's Penny challenge has been a game changer for YouTube. Pretty much bridged the gap between serial/storytelling (multiple episodes being connected), and it also shakes up the YouTube algorithem. Other creators are def gonna be inspired by it.
Respect to the camera man for running around with Ryan
Ryan is a great content creator for putting in the time and effort to make high quality, entertaining videos for us to enjoy
first
That water bottle seller was speaking HINDI 😄
POV : Your'e trying to find a comment that is not Complimenting ryan
Ryan can you pin this comment I have been watching you since you a 1k subs and I loved the penny series and I would look forward to it every day, keep up the good work man🙂

Good one Ryan

Penny
Next video. How much money I can make in 6 hours starting from a penny
One of the best things about ryan’s content is that he’s slowed it down, he has no need to make the loudest most obnoxious youtube video and I really enjoy it.
No fucking way
Omg you did it again 😂
2,725th.
THAT INDIAN FAMILY DRAMA XD
Legend says if you say Ryan Trahan 10 times he will pin you: Ryan Trahan Ryan Trahan Ryan Trahan Ryan Trahan Ryan Trahan Ryan Trahan Ryan Trahan Ryan Trahan Ryan Trahan Ryan Trahan

I think we know what’s going to happen after that last part       “I circumnavigated the world in a year with only 1 penny”

10:01 SAME I NEED TO STOP biting nails always comes back to get me

10 dollars for a hot dog????
hi
Is the end a hint for next vid
I didn’t edit this comment, so now you know how I got so many likes.
Hah , you smell like poo poo , Pee-yew 🤮
I don't know about you, but I agree with Nicole. I would totally pay 10 dollars for a jaw line like that🤣
MVP-Katie! uncle shopkeeper. o7
I am from India and feel great that Indian guy saved Ryan money
Yooooo follow meeeee
This tells you that you can do anything and still makes money 😂 thanks for this experience
The world with $0.01 thats gonna be epic
Ryan I have a challenge that might be a little harder than the penny challenge it's very similar except you start with 0.00 and you have nothing but the clothes on your back and your camera crew you cannot use your phone for anything unless it's emergency so no uber eats no venmo paypal cash app nothing like that so you have to make money without using technology that you have before the challenge
Why does he do that little forced laugh after almost every sentence?
good job ryan
So glad to find Ryan and enjoy ALL of his videos!
Awesome vlog Ryan thumb up and rember typindod that over the summer
great 👌 work u are the best
his next video will be i survived on 1 penny for 1 year lmao

This really inspires me to get off my butt and do something
This could literally be a life hack

New York City is probably the worst place to be doing the penny speedrun, everyone who is local minds their own business and doesn't really talk to people on the street most of the time  Source: Am a New Yorker
Bros running out of ideas
EEEEE
INDIAN DADS = Workplace strictness.
Those indians guys on the shop 😊❤️
Ryan carried 2022
hello
just watched that in double speed and wow was it chaotic
man is a legend
Chicago when??
idk why but everyone copies ryan
ryan has changed youtube with a PENNY
I like how he’s honest and he admitted this wasnt his first attempt
Again😮
Insane video like always!
Drinking game: take a shot every time he says 'howdy' to a stranger  Edit: disclaimer don't do this you will die
wow
Ryan never disappoints. It's always such a heartwarming time with him, to see him make people smile, spread love and kindess, whether a 30 day challenge or a 60 minute one, he makes the world a better place ❤️
everyone is very rude in NYC.
wow
loves these penny Challenge videos
Early, nice
No way he’s officially speedruning this. A challenge that requires you to be social is gonna be torture for a introvert like me and would take forever, this man’s patience is the next level!
A tease for oround the world in 30  days
Felt like he drew parallels with the pacing of this video and life in new york
Ryan would be an excellent friend post apocalypse
Can’t let it die
y
Ryan just has his own charm
As an introvert I could never…
EALRY
Please can make a penny series part 2
Lets go baby!
*Ryan’s smile and infectious attitude are what makes these videos amazing*
I liked the series but technically Ryan used his phone to doordash and all profit would have to come from the penny.
Ryan, you've no idea how much we've missed this...!!!
10 minutes ago and alreddy 100k views
Ryan is always doing the most extroverted things that introverts (like me) can’t understand how he does it 😂
Gotta love Ryan's content, always
Those caricatures gonna go up in value fr
The cameraman at the end might beat Preston
NO NO NOOOOO.
Early omg
Fun fact: If you write Fun fact at the front of a sentence people will Look at it
Stopppppppppppppp with this howdy plssssssssss, let ppl sufer their pain alone xd
classic dukaan wale uncle
That was so freaking hilarious. I had a really good time watching this video :D
Actually how many times he said 'howdy'
I live in nyc but I didn’t see u😢
Not early
Amazing how he can still carry on after the 30 day challenge. Absolute Legend!
Other YouTubers doing challenge videos: Ryan: Penny Videos!
It's back!
Best speedrun i have ever seen DONT GIVE UP BRO 👍🌹
He's back, but it's 1 hour.
So much dedication goes into these- cheers man. You never fail to entertain us👍
Wow
Would you ever be up for a challenge n running. Have an idea if you’re down
didnt expect it was indian worker in the first shop
cool
In 30 years i traveled on one penny to Mars
I miss waking up and waiting till 3pm for another episode of the one penny challenge
The views on this already is insane
Im gonna give you a video idea can please do a one penny challenge America to Canada please
Ryan is insane. Never disappointing us and always providing joy for his viewers
This comment is not gonna blow up
Hello
Bro, what is the seed?
Hi
Ryan getting limited content so he upload speedrun without even meeting mrbeast amazing Keep it up 😂
I'm glad Ryan did the penny series. youtube was kind of boring for me and I think he really entertained us all.
Maybe you should do a video of you playing madden
Legend
What I have noticed with Ryan is he’s not socially awkward he’s awkwardly social 😂😂
Ur amazing Ryan and I hope someone makes ur day today
Wow 123k in 20mins
Im gonna give you a video idea can please do a one penny challenge America to Canada please
Bro is milking this dry
13:10 sorry i parked a mile away
Can't lie but Ryan's penny series has brought such a different type of style of content on YouTube that each and every single day, we had that excitement to watch the other episode coming and coming and not knowing what's next. Brought such a good aura into YouTube
3:39 love how the Indian guy is arguing in Hindi lol
I love these so much
so happy to see you upload, you are just awesome and inspiring. That was an interesting idea, speedrunning the penny challenge. I think you could make more than $100 if you are lucky enough in New York, the caricatures money making method is really smart and fun.
This is why he has 10 million subs
Does... does the end thing gonna mean he's gonna try to cross the world with 1 penny...
This was awesome! The ending was so cool too 🌎
Hey Ryan
Not surprised if Ryan goes to space soon
Me and my cousins did this but for 5 hours instead of 1
15:16 nobody is gonna talk about the Statue of Liberty in the background LOL
Yay🎉
Should you do this   👇
Every like gets us closer to another 30 day penny challenge! :)
Does any one notice the indian shopkeeper.
3:40 wait an Indian is wrong at maths dayumm..
Ryan’s got to survive in England with one penny because we don’t really have ice coffee that often
a very good video by ryan the best youtuber in the world :D
The shop owner was an indian man...what seemed like a workplace drama to you is a everyday drama in India
first hour lets go XD
I’m sad I didn’t run into Ryan I work in that area 😭😭😭
What about MrBeast
Thanks for making so much original content! Keep it up, and thanks for keeping us entertained with so many fun video!
Honestly it’s crazy that Ryan’s videos always fail to be un entertaining
Bro those people in that 99cents shop were Indian i know exactly what were they talkin'about 😂😂😂
I don’t think any of us thought this would happen.
"Pen Girls"
Sell me this pen.
SHREEESH luv u ryan no homo
Omg yessssssss and in new york
When u uploAd I’m happy
Do any other New Yorkers get agita watching Non-New Yorkers do not New York things in New York.... If you know you know
That transition at the end went from New York to Caribbean for some reason
8:29 those are defenitely indians
You should try this same thing in Europe and see the differences.
Lov u
Yes the Best
This is amazing... just started following you and learning alot.
Nice love you man
The comeback of the penny!! 😄👍
This should be a series in different country and different cities would be amazing
WE SHOULD NAME RYAN THE PENNY KING!!
?
Did he just give us a promo of penny challange but worldwide...or am I just tripping?
y e s .
I love this!!!!!
Yay, more penny series stuff
Hi
Ryan is awesome
Ryan needs to make a series that starts from a penny and he tries to cross the world, no time limit but the faster he does it the better.
Early :))))))))))))))))              Waiting for a guy who'll say who asked
Using a penny to travel across the world soon? The ending looks like that for me
13:27 what is Spiderman doing there 🤣🕷🕸

you got a good  seed for this run. Could you share the seed?
Can I use honey on your hoodie
I love his ability to tell story’s like a father, while being funny, relatable and awkward.  One of my favorite things about Ryan.
