Love the hamilton reference at 23:35
У этого фильма 107 грехов
Just saw Glass Onion for the first time the other day, so I’ve been making the rounds of watching videos about it. There’s one thing I noticed that I haven’t seen anyone else point out and you were my last hope but you also still didn’t mention it.  The Among Us scene makes NO sense.  Blanc is just standing in the hallway outside the top engine room. A knife sound effect plays for no reason, then two people walk past him going opposite direction, and a meeting is called by a fourth person. Blanc asks what happened, I guess confused by the meeting getting called? And then somehow everyone knows it’s him, because they “saw him go in the engine room”? But so what? Nothing happened, no one’s dead.
One more sin should be added for the chess puzzle. Claire says, "It's a Chess endgame". No it isn't. It's the opening. Barely a few moves have been played. And that puzzle is just the Fool's mate.
2:20 Jackie Hoffman IS the best!
Still working with better help... Extremely Disappointing.  For those who don't know they were caught selling personal data of the therapy sessions and were sued. If you need mental help there are better places
"No! Its just dumb" with the look of pure disdain is my favorite moment of the whole film. He's just so done with this group of idiots 😂
the point of this movie is the writer/director is an arrogant twat thats making fun of his audience. this isnt a mystery movie its shiny crap.
One day, someone will think of you for the last time  Not if I eat the Mona Lisa
You like this movie waaay more than I do. The beginning was stupid. Then there was a brilliant moment in the middle that made it seem all the stupidity was on purpose. Then it went back to stupid.
Miles bought the guitar Paul McCartney wrote “Blackbird” on, and it’s right handed.
Great to know therapists are sponsoring this video because I’m gonna need one after some of these sins
Yo yo ma is the type of dude that would attend a big covied party
BetterHelp, *DING*
Here to say 10 seconds is definitely enough for anaphylactic shock That shit can happen SO FAST and it’s terrifying
Cmon guys it's a good movie
You should drop better health. They are a pretty trashy company with a terrible wrap.  Oh and 1:23 isn't that exactly how trump and RFK spoke during campaign?
1:06 I wish such a thing could happen in real life too. They must have pretty good internet.
It's clear you didn' the movie or just making up crap for views.
I’m saying this comment on hopes you and nobody else see it( I just did a sin lol ) but I be in my baths for hrs all you do is drain the water and refill it. I have done that plenty of times no worries, maybe that’s what they are doing in the movies 😂
3:23 Helen wasn't sent the invitation box, Andi was! If Miles had actually sent the invitation to Helen, then there was no point in Blanc telling her to pretend to be Andi.
Is it a sin off or on that we go from the calm, emotionless Mona Lisa to a Scream impression?
One of the dumbest "smart" movies ever made.
16:55 😂😂 We know that you love kids Jeremy
16:42 what do you mean?
23:34 Is absolutely genius.
Fuck Better Help
I love that Kermit the frog is the narrator😍❤
"F*cking Jackie Hoffman is the best." Assuming you started the sentence with a verb, this seems inappropriate to share with the world.
The real fail is the sister got a puzzle
The stupidest detective movie ever made - that alone should give triple the sins!
Cinemasins Sin: 41 seconds of advertisement!
Love Janelle in anything.
James Baxter?? The animator?? The same guy behind the Adventure Time horse? The man that animated Steven getting his gem back?? THE James Baxter??
The onion metaphor is awesome - its peeling away the truth about Miles. At the end, there is nothing at the center. Miles is empty.
it feels like benoit blanc was wayyy more reasonably clever in the first film than this movie
Damn i love the bit about the time being 2:45 nice lil nitpick keep it up.
This channel is terrible
24:47 Bron didn't own the Mona Lisa. It was on loan from the Louvre.
I will never watch this movie.
This is a dumb video
Im going to go with "less"
The number of sins that are “why does this thing happen” or “how does this happen” when the movie literally explains why or how is insane. I get you need content but don’t just strawman for the sake of it.
That leather bound journal would NOT stop a bullet. Just saying.
Doing WHAT to Jackie Hoffman is the best?
There is also an adult matters actress named Jackie Hoffman
i saw him handing the glass to duke, and was so confused when they showed duke picking it up. made the reveal a lot better tho
5:12 he mentioned the boxes went out super last minute the reason for this was because he had an extra box made for andi shortly after he killed her for the alibi
5:12 he mentioned the boxes went out super last minute the reason for this was because he had an extra box made for andi shortly after he killed her for the alibi

14:42 To refine your search and not get things you don’t want, simply add a minus sign before the word. So “world’s greatest detective -Sherlock -Batman” removes Batman and Sherlock Holmes-related information.
Theres no way that "Are you willing to break THE thing that nobody wants you to break?" was not also a meta reference to Rian Johnson himself absolutely breaking the sequel trilogy right??? And if it was... I think I just gained some respect for The Last Jedi.
1:32  no chance I’ll watch this movie.
I just realized even the masks theyre wearing on the dock match each characters personalities. The scientist wears a medical mask. The politician is wearing a fabric one but doesnt really care as it slips off her face. The celebrity 'wears' one but only as fashion accessory. The antiestablishment internet ppl dont even bother. So refreshing to see a movie that trusts its audience instead of the shovelling things down our throats most recent movies seem to do.
DING! Usiing D. Fauci and then later finding out masks, social distancing were 'not scientific' and Fauci was a liar
a bunch of old people playing among us during covid.... Sound legit.
-It's so dumb it's brilliant -No, it's just dumb This basically sums up the whole movie for me
3:55 THANK YOU! I've been saying this to my wife who doesn't understand why I dislike baths...
I assume the reason Miles didn't just burn the napkin and the envelope is so we could have a nice little callback to Edgar Allan Poe's "The Purloined Letter".  In the short story, the blackmailer who has stolen a compromising letter hides it in plain sight (although he makes it look all beaten up) on his desk (just as Miles lets the red envelope peek out), where no one pays attention to it; they are too busy taking apart chairs and looking under floorboards (just like Helen when she tears apart all the rooms).
You should sin Clue movie (1985)
lol the movie is literally based during the pandemic, how is that an unnecessary part of the plot? Lost me already
Reduce Co2 emissions, recycle, more green spaces in Cities with Cars having to pump up over people walking spaces, Break up the Oil Oligarchy...  That's how.
Amazing, cinemasins knows the movie 'Brick' .... A indie classic like 'another day in paradise '
with Jeremy Renner mentioned by name in this movie, it'll be interesting how his appearance in Knives Out 3 will be justified since his casting was announced.
Im trying to find a documentary that followed a black family in chicago. It had 2 sisters and 2 brothers but one of the brothers was dead form killing himself after killing his best friend. They talked about the younger sister hiding food in the couch. It started with one of the sisters getting her son ready for school that was right by her house. One of the brothers had done well by going to college and the other brother was in and out of prison.
I’d take 100 sins off for the sheer shock value of seeing James Bond playing Among Us
The glass hand off is on purpose in the first clip. The next two times the scene is shown duke picked it up. One thing Blanc says is that miles used the power of suggestion to convince them (and us) that we didn’t see what we thought we saw. When he is explaining it exposing miles the clip shown is the first clip that he hands it to duke.
Here are all the audio outtake clips at the end: 1 (25:05): Star Trek Into Darkness (Paramount Pictures, 2013) 2 (25:08): Airplane!

The sin at 15:30 .. Blanc knew the risk he is putting Helen in the plan .. he wanted her to be okay .. hence he did a gimmick to make her think she was the one choosing
Sin needed for the tiny bikini and gun in that guys swimming trunks
This TRASH film should be the most highly sinned filmed in cinemasins history!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Rian Johnson thinks he is clever writing movies out of order which would make ZERO sense IN order and half-brained viewers somehow applaud this sad, lazy writing??    As far as writers go you have Aaron Sorkin on one end and Rian Johnson on the other/  Super talented and absolute trash!!!
Better Help is a scam. The therapists are untrained and assigned too many clients.
14:05 > John Constantine just needs a cat to get this sorted out.
Are we taking the piss but pronouncing entrepreneurs like that?
Can we all agree the first Knives Out was brilliant because of the cast and anything Rian Johnson touches is more than likely boring, contrived, and just poorly done
What a stupid movie... Painful to watch so much uselessness.
Rian Johnson really looked at all his criticism on the last jedi and said “oh word? lemme just go make a masterpiece real quick to spite y’all”
Anyone else think it might be a Rian Johnson idea that Duke's bullets were undercharged? I was amazed there was no footage of him cleaning the gun after it went into the pool.
"Skip!" OMG I busted out at that!! Be seriously, I LOVE the Knives Out movies - I can't hardly wait for the next one!
Another sequel that once again is not as clever or good as the original
100 sins to you for jamming an ad in my face the very first frame of the video.
This is one of the ones where the CinemaWins version has more views.
loved the archer reference on 4:03
18:57 That reference will go… Miles
Id rather kill myself then ever go to therapy
the aaron burr reference 😎
My favorite detail from the whole movie is still the Rothko that Miles has hung upside down.
Okay thank you I’m glad I’m not the only one who thought it didn’t make sense. Thought I was high.
Every time I watch a movie, I sin it like cinema sins. I can’t help it🥹😅😅
i have a feeling that, upon nearly being pancaked, Duke had a suspicion that miles killed Andi, and thats why he never mentions it during his conversation with Claire and Helen, or correct miles when he says “Anderson Coopers Birthday”, which must have confirmed it even more for him.
I feel like most of the sins are of small nit-pick detail things, which are more easily overlooked and forgiven, though this channel is indeed known for these, but exclude the bigger overarching problems
Just answer one thing: Miles killed Andi. Then sends the riddle to her and invites her to the island (why?). Then her sister shows up. So when she shows up he should know that she is not the real Andi. Miles just knows that inside his island there are two people (Helen and Benoit) who knows that Andi was killed, he knows that she is a fake Andi and just goes along as nothing? What is the point?
20:51   That’s exactly the point, Miles is dumb he doesn’t get the idea to burn it until Lyonel says “and you just kept it? You didn’t burn it or anything?”
Wait is this the same guy who does cinema wins???
the archer "benoit balls" reference is so nicely hidden
@25:34 what a great freaking catch!!!
21:55 NO ITS JUST DUMB
My sin is why the fuck do they have pineapple juice on the island at all? If you’ve got one mate who is deathly allergic to it  Why? How? What?
I don't understand why this movie was so acclaimed. It's terrible.
My wife actually caught the glass handoff the first time we watched it on streaming and we had to rewind cause I wanted to double check too! I was incredibly impressed with her noticing that blink and you miss it detail
Nice to hear Kermit is still working after leaving the Street...
Sometimes I feel like CinemaSins is like those teachers that refuse to give A's. Sinning very explainable things for the sake of sinning. I get that it might be for the video to make it longer, or more "enjoyable", or make the viewer annoyed and feel the need to comment in anger (hazah) or maybe they just have a reverse shame kink. Nevertheless, sin.
0:01 DING~!. DING-DING-DING!! ALL OF THE DINGS!!!!!
im glad you took so many sins off, means the movie was actually great, and yes it was!
I'm surprised you missed sinning among US
The "no, it's just dumb" line is ripped off Neil Simon's Murder by Death. The rest of the movie either rips off Last of Sheila or Evil Under the Sun. And still Mr Johnson has the nerve of making his villain evil for the same thing
6:05 ACTUALLY a sin to y’all because if you listen you actually CAN hear him say Andi but later on it _needs_ to be made more obvious because it’s a reveal
I truly don’t understand why people love this movie so much. I loved the first knives out but I truly did not like this sequel
Can you add a bonus round for oinion references?
Ate onion minutes ago. Good for your health.
I’m hoping you just don’t know but better help is infamous for being awful
just watched this, and i just don't undertand in what possible universe or even multiverse, the Louvre would "sell" or let some rich guy "borrow" the Mona Lisa, the World's most famous painting, if anything they'd sell off lesser paitings, but the Mona Lisa......as if...
I almost turned this movie off at the beginning because most of the characters were just awful but then I realized they were designed to be unlikeable on purpose, lol.
GLASS FUNYUNS!!!!!!!!!!!!
SO DUMB, IT'S BRILLIANT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
There's one sin even you guys missed,in the scene where "andi" and blanc are in the bathroom and we realise she is accidentally drunk and blanc is chastising her and we hear blanc say "thats 9% alcohol! How many of these things you had?" But if you look closely you'll see Daniel Craig's lips keep moving after the closing of "had" as he says another word or two. My guess is irs down  to Dialogue re-writes in post, when there were scheduling clashes precluding actors from re-shooting the scene.
2 more sins: -Where did Miles get the black leather gloves, before he shoot? -When Andi finds the napkin, she topples a bookshelf. A plywood bookshelf. She is ultra rich, but buys plywood furniture?
Faicci for prison lieing pos
BIG SPOILER WARNING IF YOU HAVEN'T WATCHED THE MOVIE YET      So it is revealed later in the movie that Miles killed Andi, Andi was killed before he invited all them to his house. So Miles had already killed Andi before the weekend, and her sister pretending to be Andi showed up to the party murder mystery thing. Wouldn't Miles have been like "wait I killed that girl, how is she here?"
I warched it on Netflix too. I caught the glass hand off right away
6:38 That line clearly refers to Musk breaking Twitter some significant time before he actually does it. Is Rian Johnson clairvoyant?
This movie proves once again that most sequels are a complete waste of time.
Please do one on the Flash movie..... Please..... I have been waiting eagerly 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Love the episodes, as always, and just wanted to say thank you for always doing your own closed captions! Accessibility is awesome, and Youtube generated captions are (while nice to have) not as good as the intentional ones :)
Really loved Knives Out and looked forward to this movie but was disappointed. I had my suspicion from the very beginning it was Miles.
Sin 105 21:20 should have been 50 points.  Fuck this movie it was so stupid.
I saw miles with the gun in his hand before the bih reveal, i felt smarty detective for a second 😂😂
If that black girl destroyed the real mona lisa,all the white people on that  island wouldve made sure she stayed on that island 😂😂
I do think the "billionaire is stupid" trope lets billionaires off the hook for their deliberate crimes
I think the reason Duke doesn't say Andi initially is because  it's supposed to be like the Mandela effect we see with him giving Duke his drink. And I think the white bands are there to echo the detective saying Miles does unnecessary crap to make himself seem smarter.
It would be awesome if Elon Musk borrowed and accidently burned the mona lisa ;D
This movie is so awful
Doesn't anyone have a helicopter that can pick them up? These are some cheap rich people.
0:51 seconds of intro
The real movie sin that every movie with the Mona Lisa makes, is that the real Mona Lisa is actually relatively tiny. Movies always depict it as being the size of about an A0 portrait where in reality it is not much bigger than an A4 piece of paper. Visit the Louvre in Paris and you’ll see.
Love your channel ❤
Some writer in hollywood played the davinci mobile games and said "lets just do this"
If someone did a video of me watching this one it would be "Elisha screams at the screen cliché" like 50 times
I saw the glass switch, knew what it meant, and still very thoroughly enjoyed the rest of the movie.
I love how many sins in this can be shrugged off as, "Mike is dumb whaddya expect." 14:44 Also Blanc quite literally says "I'm not Batman" here. 17:06 She could've done it before covid man.
I was like oh yeah he can write and direct a good moive, I hope they do more like these
You didn’t even mention that Kareem Abdul-Jabar was just chilling playing among us with them
It was really clever that "Andi" said she lost her life...and she was right.
I KNEW Lionel looked familiar! That "willing to wait for it" line smacked me with recognition.
Covid wasnt an unnecessary part of the plot. They used everyone's reaction to and treatment of COVID protocol to establish their worldviews
53 seconds of ads and logos.
BETTERHELP IS TRASH just so yall know
You forgot a sin about the "piece of sh*t" dock... the one you cannot use when the tide is high... There are no noticeable tides in the Aegean Sea.
I love a good Edith Head joke.
22:45 that’s the thing though. Miles is saying they don’t have any evidence bc all the key eye-witnesses are under his payroll. So if they were to try to take him to court, they’d all lie, freeing him of any charges. THAT’S what he meant by “you’ve got nothing”
Looks like a boring movie...
No comment about the sexy wall (19:25)
Caught all that shit, made the outcome too obvious.  First one was way better.  I didn’t know the whole Andi Helen thing but knew miles was the killer.
HEY! No Brick slander. Also, sin Brick.
I love love this film. Especially the James Bond guy's detective character. Respect.  But what the hell was that scene after the shooting of "Andi", the killer could still be hanging around, that was some long conversation she and the detective had before she played dead.  Also also, the other suspects just conveniently arrive at the scene all together after their li'el chit chat? Well... hallelujah! 🙏🏿
These movies have been (somewhat) wonderful if Daniel Craig did not have that atrocious accent.
Everyone is on here bitching and my ass is all, "Heh ... January Man." Good deep dive.
Nobody talks about how he had Andis cup ready for her with her favioret drink despite thinking she was dead and not being shocked until he read the alert on dukes phone that the real Andi was dead.
It's probably a me problem, but I need to know if that was a nod or a diss at Brick...
In defence of the film, I just hit "world's greatest detective" into Google and first link was a list of 10 real-world detectives. Granted, most of them were historical figures but one of them is a woman still active today (Mary Doyle) so someone with the notoriety of Benoit Blanc would certainly be included on searches like that.
I'm surprised there wasn't a "WhaT's IN tHE BOOOOOX" outtake
We are all forgetting they burned dukes body at the end.
05:46 You think a reference to _2010: The Year We Make Contact_ is a _Kubrick_ reference? Bruh, you deserve infinity sins for that one.
Based
Hey, that was funny. I must say that I did like the seconds movie better than the first one. I can't say that too often :))
Was that an Archer reference in the bath sin? If so, 10 000 sins off.
I need a sin removed for Madelyn Cline's legs. Holy smokes.
The Covid subplot in the beginning was not needed at all. It actually took me out of the movie more than being drawn into it.
Yeah, movie was just dumb. Only conveniences just because the plot can happen.
How come no one pointed out: so if Andy has a journal with every day of her life why didn't she use that as evidence for police to show her role in the flundation of the company?
Other people: "this movie is brilliant..." People with a brain: "NO! IT'S JUST DUMB!"
So did Bron not know that Andi died? Wouldn't he know that the Andi who showed up isn't Andi?
It's hard to take seriously that a napkin is taken as "incredible proof" of something, just because of a monogram!
Wait wait wait wait wait, so that means Andi was murdered on May 12th, 2020. THAT WAS MY 17th BIRTHDAY. I turn 20 this year!
Are they paying royalties to the Beatles?  Glass Onion is a copyrighted name, its a song from "The Beatles" album aka the "white" album.
8:13 Primal Fear haha
I watched with my girl, she figure out the plot before everything and i was like 'thaaaanks'
I would've taken a sin off for the world's best drink cooler in the pool scene
“I bet Lionel is waiting to wait for it” HAMILTON REFERENCE ??
The way i see it, the red pill line isnt her making a referenxe to the matrix, but referring to how part of the internet uses it
8:50 I laughed so hard
Love when he says Lionel's willing to "wait for it". Unexpected hamilton pun that had me pause the video for a moment
Where is Duke's EpiPen?
"Miles really puts a lot of stock in the fact that this switcheroo won't be noticed by the people in the room and the audience." ... "I'm watching it on Netflix so I decided to rewind to the scene that is being flashbacked. So case solved. It's not 1933 anymore, bitches" ^^^ THIS ^^^ I saw the handoff and immediately rewound to make sure I'd seen it correctly, so I was really pissed about the flashback retconning it to not have happened.
I want you to sin the hell out of 2005's Brick
What a disappointment to cast an actor like Daniel Craig for a role like this. He is such a great actor. Despised the movie, lost respect for the actor :(  He was on the very top of my list in James Bond.
You guys missed that they put Andi in a tesla to make it look like she left the car running in the garage.
I definitely didn't catch the Andi/Anderson Cooper thing the first time around, but I also wasn't watching the movie with CC - I thought Duke just called Anderson 'Andy', and Bron was simply clarifying, which was probably the whole point in the script. *shrug* Still a fun movie though, even if the back half of the movie is a little meh.
Come on... Why would Helen mention meta-fictional characters of her Google search to Benoit
6:28 is this dude naked???
If this movie was real, pretty sure Duke would’ve died forever ago if his allergic reactions start that fast
"WHAT IS REALITY?!" lol I loved Kate Hudson (Birdie) 😂
“Myles is Tyler Durden, and while there always was a Roy, there never was an Aaron, Counselor!” had me DYING 😂😂😂
The fact that he took away so many sins shows how great this movie is
People watch this kind of Movies?
How come Miles didn't act suprised to see Andi? After all he killed her didn't he?
"I bet Lionel is willing to wait for it" I LOVE YOU 😂❤
Just a word about the sponsor - they are being fined for selling patient data to advertisers, including your answers to health questionnaires from my understanding, allegedly.
Aw I didn't catch Steven Sondheim in the movie....now I'm sad :( RIP
this movie is good but cursed
The Knives Out movies are not connected. They share the character of Benoit Blanc, but other than that, they are standalone and each story exists apart from each other.
I know "no movie is without sin", but this movie, and the first, having a sin count is both great and painfull.
I love how many sins were removed!
A sin should be removed for Duke (Dave Bautista) getting slapped by his mom after telling her to "Shut It" 🤣
I was so surprised when they showed Miles handing over the drink. Did they really think people wouldn't notice? It spoiled the whole ending.
Andi is so beautiful.
22:50 when he means nothing he assumes that no one is going to testify against him, in his mind only blanc and hellen would be testifying agaisn thim and the others would lie like they did at andis trial
I just hated that the movie lied to the audience, making it impossible to figure things out before the reveal.
Fun fact, theres no actual knives out in this movie
I love the common trend of giving elder actors their roses.
Is it really a sin that the husband in the opening shouts about the package while she is having her makeup applied.  This would probably indicate that they have not, as yet, gone live - and he's in the clear at that moment.
>sponsorship from betterhelp  Yeah, it's been fun, guys. Later.
So I watched this with my family and correctly guessed Duke dying of an allergic reaction.
Why no sins for the horrific accents?
How many sins for Rian not understanding how houses work? Kleer being 'explosive' is virtually no different than the natural gas we pump into our houses right now. Hell, just last year a house blew up two blocks from us because of a gas leak. Shattered our windows.   If you want to use something to produce energy, there will always be a combustible/explosive possibility. That's how energy works.
Duke did say Andi I'm the pool, he was just spoken over
How much did you get paid to lie about this movie? One of the worst written and acting I’ve seen in 20 years.
Ten sins off for the Rounders reference.
4:00  if you don’t leave a bath for a *week* your skin will start to tear. Though it was probably exaggerated.
Honestly thought this was just gonna be “Among Us” *ding* x10000000000 glad it wasnt
Can we sin CinemaSins for including an Among Us joke
2010 the year we made contact was not directed by Kubrick, so sin for you. An additional sin for the film is Duke would not be allowed to take his handgun to Greece(Rian Johnson is definitely American) let alone fire it on the dock without the police being called.
Better help has previously shared sensitive health data, most of their 'therapists' are counselors with no degree in psychology. There have been several incidents were people were given actively harmful advice, queer people were paired with homophobic christian counselors who pushed harmful ideology on them, poc were exposed to racists, etc. Please be careful.
1 sin to cinemasins for saying  click-Taurus lollll
The CNN shit is hilarious 😂😂😂
Didn’t enjoy this sequel…
IVE WATCHED A LONG TIME AND ONLY WANT THE BEST FOR YOU BUT I WILL NOT HAVE BRICK SLANDER!!
You should sin Avatar
Can you please do one on velvet buzzsaw ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Can you do the hunger games franchise?
Can you please do EWW David Finchers The Game. It’s so flawed a video would be hilarious! Also Social Network, Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, 1917, The Prestige.
The wait for it comment got me dead lmao
I don't think you mentioned it, same time I didn't rewind and check. The detective says to look for the napkin in rooms, but I'm pretty sure he already knew that it was in the office.
I was waiting for this to be sinned because I noticed that they did that with the hint about Miles almost hitting Duke. They changed it later so Duke said Andi before being interrupted, but originally he never said that. It is a big ol' cheat!
Saw Daniel craig in a bath tub and thought that's an interesting movie
What about American Gangster Godfather heat shutter island in Bruges Sicario Scarface space oddysee Last Castle Training Day
Thanks for recognizing its not just Fox news that's awful but also CNN.
I screamed at the Hamilton reference.
What about the fact that Duce's murder is straight up copied from Agatha Christie?
Rian Johnson sucks, this movie sucks and the first one sucks.
I think whats being missed here is that- miles is an idiot. He genuinely didnt even THINK OF THE OPTION that he could have destroyed the originals when he got them thats why this whole case works
I keep having deja vu feelings when watching this. Is this a re-upload?
Do music from anotherroom
The ending of this film should get Infinity plus one sins.
Please do a video on Bridgerton!! There’s so many moments where I think “cinemasins would point that out”
Can’t wait to see you sin the movie “The Menu”
Above all, I'm surprised you didn't sin the fact that that puzzle box is COMPLETELY IMPOSSIBLE in the real world!  Like, it is PHYSICALLY IMPOSSIBLE!
I'm honestly surprised you didn't sin the fact that every time somebody smashed something on the floor, the security system for the Mona Lisa did not activate.  I mean, the movie made huge deal of it during the scene where Duke's phone kept going off and the case kept slamming shut.
Can't believe you didn't sin the fact that they let Miles anywhere *near* the real napkin when confronting him. It's a really stupid move that they put in the movie so that the conflict could continue.
56 seconds before we get to the first sin. I know you’ve got bills to pay and an intro to run but I don’t care. I’m giving you one sin per second. We’ve got sins to get to dammit!
SO id never heard the word Oroborous before yesterday while watching a game/film theory video. then i heard it today while watching "Red Dwarf" and now again. The f*ck?
11:10 +1 sin: No tide in the Mediterranean
Please do a video for "Yesterday." I was so excited for this Beatles alternate reality, but then the movie...did not really deliver
A movie 🎥 so good it’s stooopid
Please do "richard scarry's best abc video ever!"
Please do BROKEN ARROW 1996!!
Still accepting better help as a sponsor since their recent news 🤦
Miles: "You have to break things"  Cinemasins: OMFG like HELEN BREAKING THINGS LATER, WHAT AMAZING FORESHADOWING.  Cinemasins has fallen off.
The fact that people think this is a good movie is the biggest mystery of them all. It’s a mystery even Daniel Craig and his character would be incapable of solving. The movie shows no evidence of being a good film. It’s the kind of movie dumb people call smart. People seem to think that because they “get it” and can formulate thoughts about it that that means it’s a good film, which it is not. They think that that’s that so it must be smart …that.
Better help is a fking SCAM
I knew Miles was an idiot the second he said Frusciante is the soul of the Chili Peppers.

I just wanna say i signed up for better help and in the process i had it in the back of my mind that i would end up having to pay but the process makes take you so far that it looks like it might be free, at at least get a small trial version, at the end of the entire thing i get hit with a paywall😂 and i was really looking forward to some help at the time too
How’s the peeping how’s the TMR sins video how’s the peeping
I really liked this movie and also the original Knives Out movie but there were so many issues with the plot that just don’t make sense.
Apparently sins guy doesnt know how soap works.
This movie was so predictable...
Great cast, truly awful ending
@23:34 nice Hamilton / Aaron Burr reference
Yes because it's not a HIPAA violation if you give them permission as you agree to use the app.
I haven’t seen anyone mention the fact that they LEFT DUKE’S BODY IN A BURNING BUILDING
Was this channel ever funny? Or did I create that memory in my head?
Sin removal for the fact that the museum lied to him about that being the actual Mona Lisa.
Red pill wasn't just a Matrix reference, it was an incel slang reference
Why is there a sin for scarface
This movie got more sins than Megamind😭
Good 👍 review sir thank you
The guy behind Cinemasins gains $ off Betterhelp which is a scam.  Checks out based on his abuse allegations.
Definitely thought it was pretty messed up that everyone there was going to apparently allow Miles to get away with 2 murders and changed their mind after nearly being killed themselves
miles just needed head fr fr
I think glass onion is a good movie, but not a good mystery, in the sense that it does not make much sense when you think about it too hard
Big fan of the way YouTube played a betterhelp ad immediately the in-video ad. Just really super love it. Love ads. Love double ads. Love double ads for the exact same thing.
Hey CS!! Could you watch and Sin ‘Fall’? Istg my friend and I where furious watching it
You do realize that this movie is just Hulk killing Drax, but couldn't get it past 007 because Hulk wasn't Smart Hulk ;p.
No sun there. Giant is great
Please do the Mario movie
This is fun, I had fun watching it. Liked knives out a little better, the details were a little more subtle. This one is more bombastic. Still fun.
Thanks for you videos 😊
Well done. Wellll done.
Does it in over 25 min
He says Andi EVERYTIME that scene is shown. The fact it is pointed out for not being there when you can audibly hear it is laughable
There should've been a sin removed for them playing Among Us, lol. I like when they enjoy the movies they're sinning in videos. This had a lot of well deserved sins removed. It was great.
About 3 of the sins you gave ignored the main premise of the reveal, Bron was dumb. That's why he kept the envelope etc
Besides being just awful?
I saw the movie a while ago and I can't even remember why miles invites and to the island at all tbh
Bruhh its 2023 and someone still advertising betterhelp...
This movie was absolutely pointless and linear, a child could’ve written this plot… I enjoyed this video more than I did the film. Thank you!
The archer reference at four minutes. Benewah balls.
I actually liked it even though I figured it out half way through
Glass Onion is a woke trash movie!
Thx
🎉🎉🎉
Love you guys but I would suggest looking into the reality of BH. I know contracts can be binding and you may not be able to help it, but if you can I would no longer work with them.
In both Knives Out and Glass Onion, the movies use different shots/recordings to show what the CHARACTERS heard in the moment. When Marta is driving down the road and hears Harlem say both before and after the carved elephant. It happens a few other times in the film too. That’s what’s happening with Duke saying “andi”, Blanc only hears “and” at that moment and later thinks it through for the reveal because he’s brilliant
I liked “Keeping the Faith”
- army of darkness
next - silent hill
Honestly I hope Helen gets life in prison for attempted murder and destruction of a national treasure. So one guy killed one girl and put more at risk. She could have simply shot and killed him. That would been better than destroying a priceless treasure like the Mona Lisa. There will always be murder and a-holes, horrible tragedies and the like. There will only be ONE Mona Lisa. Once it's gone it's gone. Honestly I'm of the opinion of people who destroy artifacts of history should be put to death. That piece of art and history is far more valuable than a single life. Got billions of humans and a far less number treasures that withstood time to be around to this day. In my eyes that last act made her the true villain of this movie far more than anyone else.
Okay. Just wondering, am I the only one who showers off and rinse out the tub before taking a bath? Because... He's right, baths are not that clean.
17:17 also misuse of "literally"
Kinda funnny for the sin on the allergic reaction  Cus i have a deadly shellfish allergy n have DEFINITELY accidentally ingested like shellfish juice n i feel it almost immediately n my throats closed in what feels like 30 seconds or less lol
Wasn’t the Mona Lisa painted on wood not canvas?
Please do Avatar The Way of Water!
The thing about the extra bracelet just BREAKS EVERYTHING ELSE.
No comment on Blanc and Helen’s use of an audio recorder earlier in the film which is conspicuously absent as Miles freely speaks about the crimes he’s committed?   Blanc leaving Helen alone surrounded by people she cannot trust including one that only moments prior had tried to kill her was ridiculous. Totally out of character to leave her in such a dangerous situation.
bruhhh not the better help sponsorship…
This movie was great glad I was able to watch it in theaters during its limited release. Netflix really should of let it had a longer stay in theaters.
Alright, Ben Shapiro
The Sins sometimes are so biased sometime. It frustrates me, not super in this video but in other videos
i do want to point out that occurring during COVID does contribute to the movie - seeing who's wearing a mask and how they're wearing it gives us clues to the personality of the characters. for example, claire is wearing a mask but it doesn't cover her nose, which mirrors her political career (pretending to care about something for appearances but not fully caring about or understanding it). likewise, duke isn't wearing a mask, which if we hadn't already understood his character from the video/podcast segment (its been a while since i watched sorry) impresses upon us even more that he's kind of an asshole.
The random guy walking around in a bathrobe is the actual genius
This film was fun, but it had SOOOOO many plot holes.  2:08--*Gasp* How dare you, sir! I ding you!!
You misspoke actually. They showed up to Andi’s house after one night/day of no response as Andi was killed the day after the email and they arrived when Miles was fleeing
This beats "I can smell the comments."
Casey has such a passion. Thank you for your testimony and wisdom!
I almost spit out my drink with that American Plunger Society joke lol
BILL!  Is that you?  My friend?
guys it was a hamilton reference guys cinemasins made a hamilton reference
One of the worst, contrived and unfunny movies I‘ve seen in…well since Thor Love&Thunder 😂🙈 and I actually like the first Knive‘s Out. Such a letdown
23:01 I totally expected Helen to pull out her audio recorder in this scene as hopefully a last scrap of evidence, since she had used it previously but .. I guess not! Maybe it was a bit too similar to the last act of the first movie, but also why even have the recorder as an element in the film if you’re barely going to utilize it?
The Lansbury/Sondheim cameo makes me smile and cry at the same time.  It's very cute, but also... they are now gone.
The “cracking the case” comment was gold 😂
Woah, that dub at the end of Edward Norton introducing Janelle Monáe on SNL was from 2013 😮
"I bet Lionel is willing to wait for it" made me scream
Movie's good but honestly, not saying 100% of the plot-holes and plot-conveniences crossed my mind when watching it, but the amount I had already made me think that there's a little too much.  For a supposedly really intricate script about the world's best detective solving the hardest mystery crimes, I feel it could've been polished a little more
Betterhelp sells your information
This movie sucked and was not as intelligent as it thinks it is.  The plot is nonsense and pretty golden rules of mysteries, doesn't hold up to any scrutiny.  The idea a company's success can be down to a napkin suggests a severe lack of basic business knowledge.
Wasn’t the snap bracelet for the other girl that died?
This movie was such dog shit that it would need a video of equal length to tally its sins
Fuck betterhelp you’d think you tubers would remember them
Isn't "Red Pill" a misogynistic group?
SIN #121 🧅s are NOT made out of GLASS!  That would tear up your mouth worse than CAPTAIN CRUNCH.
Stupidest movie ever...my husband and I hung on for 45 minutes and turned it off
Worse Than Clue.  At least that one knew it was funny.
Double sins for this video for not giving this movie the amount of sins it deserves
The people who made this movie tried to be smart and pretentious but they weren't smart enough to pull it off.
"Finding a box's clicktoris..."🤣🤣🤣
I didn’t even notice the “Im not here” guy was the same actor who played one of the detectives from the first movie until you mentioned it, lol.
1:30 They give politicians too much credit.
Ethan Hawke AKA Elon Musk. Also Lionel is not too sexy to be a scientist, thank you laV-bar Burton. (come on girls we all know that either a you had a picture of him as Kwame, watch that scene from Roots on repeat and regret yet also feel strangely aroused, and ridiculously hunt for that rare all male version of the TNG cast in their sexy outfits standing next to their appointed stations. Calendar you know that they actually did release that calendar they would make bank! Just from May, February, and, June! Heck I expect several people want the calendar they're with the versions of them today!)
The CriticalDrinker was right
Do Puss in Boots 2!
You sound like Kermit The Frog
sin 2001 a space odyssey you cowards
as with all things infected with woke cult equity crap, this suffers from a lack of any kind of relatability. there is only one single good bit of acting/writing in this whole movie. when the detective decided to fuck over the host at the dinner table and lay out the whole game in the first 5 seconds.  everything else is bland and dull and can only be described as woke cult porn.
Can’t believe y’all failed to point out the real Mona Lisa was painted on wood, not canvas like it’s shown to be in the film. Which means that the Louvre did, indeed, give Miles a cheap copy to make some extra cash during the pandemic.
11:12, a plot hole. "the boat can't come until low tide"...its a plot point in the movie that Miles is an idiot and does not even know the mediterranean has no tides. so why would the boat captain think that?
I think the one thing that frustrated me about the movie is the Helen and Blanc didn’t think ahead to take a picture of the napkin before confronting Miles. If you know he’s willing to kill for it, surely he’s not just gonna let you walk out with it
I'm disappointed you are still promoting Better Help with all the controversy around them :(
This episode should have been a lot longer
Cinema sin sin: 2010 was NOT a Kubrick movie, it was a sequel to a Kubrick movie....ha, I bet you feel dumb now.
This movie is not "really good" as stated in the video description. It's awful.
I dont know how anyone sat through more than 5 minutes of either of the 2 pieces of shite
gloves don't effect your ability to accurately shoot.
Hey guys please don’t promote betterhelp
This movie really just wasn’t good though. A movie for the masses I suppose but any serious movie fan didn’t enjoy this film
it's hard for me to watch movies like this where Kathryn Hahn is a potential suspect in whatever is going on because I can't help but think that it was Agatha, I mean Kathryn, all along.
BetterHelp? REALLY? It’d have been less harmful to shill for bloody RAID.
I hated this movie. Dialog couldn’t be more pretentious
Some consider the insanity of the movie Rubber genius...
I like to imagine that Benoit Blanc is the son of Judge Chamberlain Haller from _My Cousin Vinny_ . Both have intense blue eyes and molasses-speed Southern drawl, both in the legal field in some capacity. Haller doesn't mind that Benny is gay, he just minds that he's dating an Englishman.
nahh like really imagine the bihh you just killed and the world's greatest detective pulling up to yo private island party 😂😂
"A third class action lawsuit was filed on March 23, 2023 against BetterHelp, Inc. (“BetterHelp”) in the Northern District of California. The suit claims BetterHelp mismanaged the plaintiff's, and allegedly similarly situated class members”, sensitive health information."  Pease dont promote them @CinemaSins.
Did anyone noticed Edward Norton has a uncanny resemblance with Matthew Perry in this movie?
Hercule Poirot > Benoit Blanc  There. I said it.
Sinning the movie for it being legends last times on film is nasty work…. Wow
9:48 Peg inserted herself into that nonsense.
Cinemanins why do you add sins to things you like. and why do you need to give a sin for Jesica Fletcher dying in real life. How is that a sin of this movie?!!
The movie falls apart pretty hard once you realize Miles Bron's reaction to seeing someone he KILLED, is "oh, you're here. didn't expect to see you - anyway, let's play a game". No aborts, red flags, calling up his security or hiring a hitman...
Better help in selling your confidential information!
5:57  one sin removal for the bikini 👙
Jesus Christ, I cannot emphasize how much of my water I spat out on the "Couple of sins off for these legends no longer being among us" line. 🤣🤣
Love the Airplane! references - this one was quite unexpected!
25:31 nice👌🏽
I'm pretty ready for you guys to sin Jeremiah Johnson........
14:17-14:19 Andi's message was on May 11th, and Benoit's computer reads May 14th. So, this was two days later.
Glass Onion is a smart movie for dumb people.
Totally forgot about Natasha Lyonne's cameo, but it makes sense after watching Poker Face on Peacock. Poker Face is 🔥
was...was that really an among us joke?
BetterHelp is incredibly shady.... Apparently even PewDiePie made a video on them 4 years ago but I have only seen illuminaughtii's video on them and I would not support this company.
(John 3:16,17) "For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believes in Him should not perish, but should have eternal life. For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world might be saved through Him." (Romans 10:9,10) "That if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your that God has raised Him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart, man believeth unto righteousness and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation."
Better health is a scam. I wish YouTubers would stop promoting it.
A sin for the sponsorship?  Not to stir things up, but CinemaSins is big enough to get a better company than BetterHelp to sponsor?
biggest sin of all: when miles offers him a drink missing the james bond insert _"do i look like i give a damn"_
17:23 additional sin for Blanc not being able to clearly hear this conversation over a fairly still pool, which is fantastic at preserving sound across still water.
The Mona Lisa is oil on wooden panel. It wouldn't burn the way we see it. Ergo: MILES RENTED A FAKE😂😂😂😂
was that a ff up daniel craig?
This movie is Daniel Craig Smith's one of the best performances period.
I’m sure I’ve watched it but remind me thanks
Honestly... the biggest sin of all is I can't get Glass Onion on Blu-ray.
What is the lowest sin counter per movie run time?  Or perfect movie u think is.? Love to hear it.
Why did Miles shoot Helen?
I love when you can tell when these guys actually do like the movie they're sinning. It's satisfying
I love that they are all breaking glass items with most of the cast wearing sandals and open toed shoes but no one mentions stepping on glass, getting cut, or even that the glass shards ripped a hole in the sandals. These are thin and flimsy shoes! Everyone should be limping out with glass stuck in their feet
+500 sins for one of the worst, laziest, pseudo intelligent, half assed screenplays in the last 30 years.   This movie being well received is a more of a comment of how low standards have fallen than anything about it's own merit.   CinemaSins went too easy on this.
You missed the sin that the among us game is basically what happens for the rest of the movie
Cinemasins needs to collab with the sarcastic dude from nerd explains they're like nitpicky asshole long lost brothers 😂
The boats can't come in to shore but for an extremely rich man perhaps a helicopter or a hover craft could be used.
45 SECONDS OF ADS - DING
The Zoom call with Natasha Leonne should be a sin because she was filming it while filming Poker Face, also directed by Rian Johnson
I loved the first knives out but this one was a little bit of a let down. I saw duke dying by pineapple from a mile away, and Bron being the killer was so obvious. At first I doubted it was him because it was too obvious but then his idiot plan was revealed and I was so disappointed. Although, I did love Blancs rant about the plan being so dumb. The “it’s so dumb it’s smart” “no it’s just dumb!” Was hilarious lol. But it didn’t have the same feeling as the first with the attention to detail in the mansion and the characters. In the first one while we all suspected ransom we never thought it would be him after Marta was supposedly the culprit. The murder plan and all the little details made it such a nice watch.
Kate Hudson in that orange bathing suit, Good God! * Removes 5 sins *
I actually like COVID in movies. It felt like such a shift from everyday life that I thought it was a missed opportunity whenever movies set in 2020/2021 don’t include it
I love you guys and your critiques. The thing I enjoyed most about his movie was Daniel Craig's yokel detective act. His segway from Bond was glorious.
Allegedly 'Better Help' has been giving and/or selling peoples private and confidential information - i would Advise CinemaSins not do another sponsor woth them again as to not hurt their Reputation - And - No One actually use Better Help, especially when there are garunteed to be other options in your area.
One thing that I did find cool about the finale is that they did the research to find out that the Mona Lisa was painted on a piece of Wood and burnt the painting the way it would if that was the case.
Thanks. I myself watched the first half before giving up. Nice to know that it didn't get better. Thing I noticed most was people standing around four or five paces from each other while conversing. Nobody — especially Benoit Blanc — ever seemed to emote or speak loudly. When they are standing on a windy pier in a crowded town none of the background noise is not captured at all by the microphones.  Can you imagine how hard it must be to record a normal conversation in a vast glass dome? The background echos and air conditioning noise must have been terrible.
what a good movie
To me I'm mostly annoyed because I agree with everything the film is trying to say. To me a film being self aware doesn't absolve it of its flaws.  I think it's important to make room for nuance and the film had little, which is a shame because the first movie was done so well. I had a similar issue with Don't Look Up, I feel like political movies can be done well without ambiguity but what we're currently getting insists on beating us over the head with a message we already agree with (or vehemently don't).   There's no real depth or discussion, just people who nod their heads saying "so true", people who weren't open to the topics in the first place, and people who are just tired of self indulgent back-patting for media that doesn't push the envelope. What's the point in the message if no one changes their mind?
The Hamilton reference 🤣.
❤
"Lionel here is willing to wait for it."😂Best reference in this video!
I like those chairs 9:13
Open toed shoes in the glass smashing scene is my biggest sin
All I can say it was terrible
glass onion was so boring i stg
I would end and start with anyone who casts Daniel Craig in any movie. Frank Azeris should sue, as Craig stole Brockmire’s accent.   Saw this movie on Netflix. There is a reason I will not go to the theater to see movies. All the movies pretty much suck, and I don’t have the imagination to pretend they are any good. Not a good look for a black woman to destroy everything either.But to be honest, everything sucked about the movie. What a bloody waste of time.
Dude was trying so hard not to sin his own better help ad
ngl, knives out was good, but this one just wasn't even close. this movie had way too many silly gags and the mystery itself made little sense? Also... boat not being able to arrive, host being the murderer (except you know who the host is), on a random island in a paradise house, sound a little like an "And Then There Were None" but just done way worse?
This movie couldn't hold a candle to Knives Out. Better story, better cast (as much as I love Edward Norton), not as convoluted to reach the final reveal.
I appreciate the “I want the truth”, editors
About time A24 comes out with something good been a long time since they have
You've never gone to court have you?
Do scream 6
do my all american
Surprised Better Help is still being used as a sponsor…doesn’t the channel know the sins of Better Help?
I was going to give it a watch..thanks for sparing me the waste of time..
It’s about time
Is it me or is the glass horse she shatters the fat white opera horse from What's Opera, Doc? 23:43
Isn’t better help not helpful
Ha!! Benoit Balls!! {minus one sin}
I read somewhere that the Mona Lisa at Mile's place is actually a fake. Something about the frame being constructed incorrectly which is something a prop designer would know to recreate.
Bro you clearly haven't sat in the bath long enough to have to turn on the hot water to even shut out
3:43 he says these legends are no longer among us while "among us" is being played.... clever
White people saying "woke" is the biggest sin of all.
It’s not 24 minutes
He killed her sister! She burned the Mona Lisa to f him up bc he murdered her sister. How do everybody forget that part?
RIP Sondheim.
Daniel Craig and Batista meet again.
The jokes and puns had me ROLLING! another great recaps and raost
As a bath man .. ya empty and refill the heated water. Never let that filth get cold 😆
Better Help is selling patient data. Might want to think twice before subscribing to it.
Great job.. keep it up!!
Betterhelp is an exploitative and ineffective scam. Do better.
Thrilled that I can get a therapist online!!!  I can't wait to tell them EVERTHING about little ol me. I'M SURE MY PRIVACY WILL BE PROTECTED FOR ABOUT 1 SECOND
Nah, only seen the meme to shit on dumb ideas
3:45 This HAS to be on purpose right wtf
Absolutely love the Hamilton sin😂
Wait isn’t this the second movie? I didn’t watch the first one but I did see the second one. And that’s def the second one
you forgot a sin for dressing like the temple on epstein island
ONIONS
This movie makes me cringe
you should definitely do a sin count for willys wonderland
Please do The Menu
Do The Menu
I'm the best detective ever, also i'm the best at receiving oral.
No slander on toccata and fugue in D minor please!
Stop using Better Help as a sponsor. They were selling sensitive mental health data to Facebook
14:38 Out of curiosity, I went ahead and googled "Greatest Detective of all time", and my results included Allan Pinkerton, Mark Fuhrman, John Yates, Jaqcueline Shire, Jim Leavelle, Frank Serpico, Tom Horn, Jon Burge and Ed Hickox. And beneath all that, only ONE site listing fictional ones. And it's just plain blasphemy that said list didn't include Professor Layton
10:30 deserves ANOTHER sin because it's a fucking pain in the ass to even notice the sleight of hand happening the first time, ALSO, the pineapple allergen was said so heavily in passing that I forgot about it
I’m convinced you’re stalking me cuz I watched this movie today
@4:00 why not just cycle the water then ? lmaoooo
I'm surprised the speedo holster wasn't sinned, it's the MOST stupid place to keep your firearm, you can literally accidentally shoot off your junk on accident
How is Jeremy Renner in this universe even though he's  in the MCU alongside Bautista? And how did you not catch that sin?
God, wearing masks outdoors looks even more stupid in the movies lmao.
Friendly reminder that Better Help got in trouble for selling patient information
YEEEES
I love the fact that Blanc correctly references 2010 regarding "my god, it's full of stars" and not 2001 (in terms of movie adaptations).  But then Jeremy calls it a Kubrick reference, even tho Kubrick didn't direct 2010.  It just feels like we saw Blanc outsmart Jeremy on screen!
Ok but Covid is actually immensely crucial to the plot
I disliked this movie so much 💀💀
OMG FORGOT ABT BIRDIE'S WOKE COMMENT NOW I LOVE HER EVEN MORE
WAS WAITING FOR THIS!! TYSMMMM
Better Help. Really? They have already been exposed. Anyway - bye!
These guys larp as comedians when none of their jokes land. Clearly they're movie critics and their clickbait "sins" are just SEO bullshit to drive views. So removing sins from this movie for a dumb bitch who lucks into coming out on top at the end and a plot that enables it while "sinning" hundred times better movies is beyond dishonest. But what do these leeches care beyond whatever feed YouTube puts into their mouths.  These writers desperately want to be Quentin Tarantino but don't have a shred of talent. So they decided to do what all pathetic losers do: shit on better men's work. And yet this movie gets sins removed, for being the objectively dogshit movie it is. No accounting for taste.
I really wanted to love this movie, but story and pacing were all over the place, and I figured out the murderer as quickly as Blanc did the scripted one during dinner.
Appreciate calling out how difficult that shot Miles makes at Helen was
I was waiting for this
The greatest trick Rian Johnson ever pulled was convincing people he could write a good murder mystery.
120 are a lot of sins for a brilliant movie
Flaws aside, god I love this film.  Can't wait for the next one
Missed plot hole: how does Duke get his gun past airport security and into Greece? This movie isn't set in America, you can't just carry a gun around just because "you never know when shit's going to go down" 🙄
HOW DARE YOU SIN SCARFACE  I don't think I can be a subscriber anymore
Lump killed with that song at Woodstock 99
Edward Norton's character was like his other character Steve from the Italian job .. Unimaginative and only bought/did what others wanted to have/dreamt of doing .. In Glass Onion, Miles was stealing Andi's ideas and even Blanc's idea
One thing nobody else seems to mention is that Klear actually could work as a super fuel. Just dont put it in houses that cant contain the hydrogen or whatever. Like you do with radioactive materials and nuclear plants, put it in a power plant that CAN contain it and run the power through the grid. Now, Miles may be dumb enough to think of that but Andi is said to actually have been intelligent and Miles had actual scientists working for him.
After years of watching cinema sins this is the first time I’ve stoped the video to actually go check out the movie. I’ll be back for laughs.
This movie sucked so much compared to the 1st
We definitely DID hear Duke say Andi in that pool scene.
This movie is a rip-off of "And then they were gone" but poorly made.
film was nowhere near as good as the 1st, charcters waaaaay to unlikable, perhaps that was the point but as a viewer there was no one to side with
Airplane!
This movie was made for sinning
20:39 because he's an idiot, they established this. Lionel even mentions how it's stupid how Miles didn't burn it later, and that's what gives him the idea to burn it in the first place.
24 minutes isn't long enough for this smug piece of shit movie
8:30 A spoiled Mama's Boy who ISN'T a part of the Royal Family? How is this poss....Oh. Colonizer Privilege.
6:36 Well, damn. He foreshadowed harder than HARRY OSBORNE in his hospital bed in SPIDER-MAN 3 or DOC OCK in SpiderMan 2. They actually predict how the film will end.
You ought to have removed a sin for Peg using a sharpie to write her own name on a Solo cup.
i thought the glass sculptures that they were smashing in the end were really made from Klear and smashing them helped with the Hindenburg effect. Throughout that scene, when everything is on fire, you see those little bursts of fire randomly ignite, that made me think it were pieces of the Klear sculptures.
So Whisky thinks Andi killed Duke, she goes all badass chasing Andi down with a harpoon, but when she finds out Miles is the killer she does... nothing? You're NOT going to add a few sins for that? Whisky really came alive in that scene and her grieving Dukes death. Wondering what to say to his mother. Really a waste of good Whisky😢
A+ Pulp Fiction reference at the very end
The worst thing about this movie was that unlike the first Knives Out, we get shown fairly early on that Miles Bron isn’t a very good guy, making the eventual twist not as thrilling or shocking.  It felt like they spent more time with the “HEY! Remember when people would have to wear masks all the time and wait, what’s this?  Hey!  There’s Among Us!” Rather than focusing on the “whodunnit?” But of the story.
I love this movie so very much, but one thing that's always bugged me about the end: without the napkin, no, there is no physical evidence, and Miles got everyone to lie for him in court before... but if Benoit freaking Blanc -- the world's greatest detective -- tells the authorities "Hey so Miles Braun killed Andi Brand and while there's no physical evidence right now, I witnessed him essentially admit to it, saw him burn the original napkin, yada yada yada"... would that not be enough to at least open a real investigation? Like, of all the potential witnesses in the world you should be willing to listen to, isn't the guy who is literally recognized as the best detective on the planet one of them?
I’ve been waiting for this video for so long!!
I thought there would be a sin for the possibility Edward Norton's belongings were destroyed, but his fortune is still protected. He could easily spin the story about how his house was destroyed, ultimately negating Helen's supposed revenge.
I was wondering when this movie would be talked about
20:39- that's exactly the point. There is no reason for miles to do so, but he does it anyway, cuz he's dumb. Blanc and lionel even comment on it later
so many sins removed...forgiveness is it love it all the same 😂
The more I think about this movie the less I like it. I'm on "I don't see what the big deal is" right now, verging on "am I the only one that didn't like it?".
As a teacher, "You play Clue with 3rd graders over Zoom!?" may be the funniest sin I've ever heard.
I liked the Anderson Cooper's bday shout out because his bday is the same day as mine :)
add chapters if u get a sponsor plzzz i want to skip the ad
you don't know fancy bath, sorry for you.
Brick acknowledgment is always appreciated
I typed in Google 'greatest detectives', and i first got a list with 'top ten real life detectives', so yes, that could be the way that she found Blanc. Take a sin of.
The fact that this movie was even made is a sin in and of itself. This movie made no sense.
I really hated this movie. It tried too hard to be witty and "in the corona-times". Had to stop halfway through.
3:27 The foreshadowing you miss, if you only watch this once.
I’m proud to say I noticed the glass switcheroo immediately so take that folks
1:39 She was so dumb. She complains about WOKENESS; but look who she invited into her bubble. I'm sure the old famous guy is a direct contradiction to her statement.
A serious question, I'm not trying to undermine the concept, but why are you still advertising BetterHelp? It has been reported many times to not at all be the service it claims to be.
Bonus Sin: Among Us was not popular during May of 2020.
4:03 Lol Benoit..BALLS 🤣🤣 Archer would be proud
HOLY SHIT! That *WAS* Ethan Hawke!!!
This movie was so predictable. But still a good watch.
I laughed so hard when Benoit corrected Birdie "No! It's just dumb." 😂
Just wanna point out Miles has the glass@nion logo in his room, so the whole napkin thing makes even less sense
Ford V Ferrari should be next. Thousands of sin removals just waiting
I think this is was a great mystery in my opinion!
Another sin off that Benoit is carefully observing everyone as they arrive on the dock but is looking at everyone on the boat as not-Andi arrives behind him.
what is this garbage????     so glad I've never heard of this tripe --- worse thing I've ever seen here.....
The January Man was an infinitely better film
I love how at 3:33 Rian included the lady from Poker Face into the zoom call of detective friends.
The fact that they use Bader for the Batman outtake is inspired
I want a sin for blow up kayak being blown up in the house please.
The kareem/airplane soundbite was great 🤘🍻🤘
I thought Glass Onion was sortof Rian Johnson's way of poking fun at Mystery movies in similar way that The Big Lebowski was satirical of Film Noir. I even thought it was fun that there was a character who was basically "The Dude" wandering around to occasionally tell the audience to ignore him, and by extension the homage/inspiration taken from The Big Lebowski.  Then I found out that the Director of Photography and Production Designer Rian hired to do Glass Onion both also did The Big Lebowski.  Rian Johnson is a giant Troll.
Gillian Flynn's name is pronounced with a hard G. Sin to you both!
Love the duel between this and CInemaWins.
Thank you for watching this, so I didn't have to.   These knives out seemed to be much better.
I wanted a sin off for “is that a motorcar? What’s it doing on the roof”
I appreciate the support of services like Better Help. but it worries me that at the top of the list of treatment skills wanted is a psychologist that "Listens" ? how else will they do you any good?
I just realised the pessimistic movie guy frequently has a therapy sponsor. It tickles a certain part of my brain and I don't know why.
25:18 I'm sorry but this should have been the Invisible logo just showing up.  Would've been top tier
I’ve seen this movie twice but it wasn’t until watching this video that I realized Helen said her life was taken away by “someone” before correcting herself and saying “everyone” in this room. Just another hint she wasn’t the real Andi..
What's with all the reuploads?
This movie sucked. Can't believe it hasn't got more sins. 1000 sins for Rian Johnson. This movie writing is even worse then his Star Wars writing.
9:30 No, pushing on the little statue is the security override function. The glass can still open on its own without it, it just won't do so if the system detects a present threat, which is what it's doing every time someone's phone dings. I don't know why that of all things is considered a threat, but there's internal consistency that you missed.
Sin! Keeping the Faith is a solid film. Also, I like the idea of him being upset that Gillian Flynn was expensive. It's character-establishing.
Sorry, couldn't get thru the film, also couldn't get thru this sin fest video. That HORRIBLE fake southern accent after 5 minutes was too much. WHO thought that was a good idea????
You missed that there are no significant tides in the Mediterranean. Like 0 to 20 centimeters depending where you are. That's the biggest sin of all.
lol, thank you for the Archer reference
This movie is not Glass Onion. It's Ass Glonion
Having Angela Lansbury in the movie and not have her solve a crime deserves 100 extra sins
This movie is so overrated it’s insane. The ending doesn’t make sense at all. They wouldn’t turn on him because they’re all still liable and could be sentenced.
I was thinking the exact same thing about the clue 10. I studied that exact Little Fugue in G minor by Bach in a history of classical music class. We never had the exact wording "it's layered on top of each other." It's an apt description but it's a bit shady
I feel like Derol deserves another sin. Yeah, it's funny watching him strolling around in the background all through the chaos, but this is a fucking MURDER MYSTERY. The presence of another, random guy on the island should absolutely have been brought up by Benoit at some point.
Offended that there was no son/sin off for Birdie picking up the knife, thus making us believe there were two killers around but it was just *Birdie*
God bless Angela Lansbury, she is missed.
Am i the only one confused by the ending? What was the point in trying to set the place on fire?? HELP!
why did this video have me looking up if steven spielberg died without me knowing
"Why is Helen starting with the small shit" Satisfaction. Yeah, she COULD just go for the big kaboom from the start. But breaking each and every object in this bastards home before lighting the fucker up would be FAR more satisfying.
On their arrival at the beach he claims " the guitar Lennon wrote Blackbird on ...Paul wrote Blackbird riff ...sin missed .
red pill is in reference to conservatism not the matrix...you could say it originated there but..
Yeah, everyone knows Miles' crimes, and their testimony is all that would really be needed to get him convicted. But that's the point, none of the Alpha's WANT to testify, because they all feel they need Miles, and it's not until Miles gets royally fucked at the end of the movie that they decide he can't do anything for them anymore. That's why them saying that they'll testify at the end of the movie is important, because it means his crimes WILL be exposed.
Idk if it's just only happened me but better help shldnt be sponsored i see many utube channels doing it but better help don't have proper client confidentiality and client care. Not only was the 1st 2 therapist mostly uncaring most of my private info I told the therapist was used in advertising for me. Feels like this what most therapist do as a side gigs for some extra cash
It just dawned on me how utterly selfish it would be to potentially deny the world of a masterpiece like the Mona Lisa just out of spite. Would be like someone setting fire to Notre-Dame all over again
That’s funny I just happen to watch this movie for the first time yesterday
Room 1408 is a great movie
I think the only good thing about this movie is "Dave Bautista".
Helen's faux cattiness and guilt when she was smashing stuff was so hilarious and endearing. It reminds me that I have a massive Janelle Monae crush
I personally choose to believe that the French government gave Miles a fake Mona Lisa because they knew he's an idiot and wouldn't notice...and he didn't. So when the headline breaks that he destroyed it, he gets a double whammy of embarrassment when the French go 'no he didn't, it's a fake! Did he really believe we'd give him the real one?'
It wasn’t Agatha all along
Now Biden isnt perfect but he's done a damn better job with the pandemic.   Trump - Let's inject bleach Biden - let's distribute the vaccine.   Biden 2024!!!!!
Benoit Balls! Looks like CinemaSins guy watches Archer! Love that
Loved the Edward Norton SNL bit
I love when you can tell when these guys actually do like the movie they're sinning. It's satisfying
Kate Hudson that’s the sin removal
Please sin the 2017 and 2021 My Little Pony movies
I’m literally watching cinema wins for this movie when this was posted.
The point with the puzzle box being so simple, such as the hidden button being in the middle was probably one of the first indications that they were all simpletons. The puzzle designer that the Musk stand in didn't want to make it to hard for them.
Great messages the movies gives you. Break stuff until good stuff happens. Got it.
Kind of sad you didn't include the scene in the Glass Onion bar, where Miles misses a relatively easy shot in pool. I suppose it doesn't have much significance, but I like it just as another way to 'lay on thick' how idiotic Miles is.
Edward Norton is a great actor
Someone said a good twist would have been if there had been a hint that the sister was the murderer and Blanc didn't catch on until it was too late and that an innocent man had been framed.
I headcanon that it's not actually the Mona Lisa. The Mona Lisa is pained on wood, not canvas like in the film; I reckon Miles got scammed by a con man :P Similarly, it's not Paul McCarntey's guitar, because McCartney is left handed. I just reckon there's a load of rich con-men who duped the idiotic millionaire
Jackie Hoffmann was the best thing about this movie. She was hilarious in Only Murders in the Building too  Also to call a bath 'stewing in your own filth' is a clear Chandler reference
The slogan for the American Plunger Society somehow clogs the script 🤣
Love this movie
I'm gonna be a little nitpicker here for a second 9:26 - the gnome is an emergency override that Miles wasn't supposed to have. The case opens, and closes on its own when it detects no threat, but he had the button installed to unlock it whenever he wants because he's a prick lmfao 12:00 - I just have to point out that it doesn't ding anymore because Miles silenced it! That's why he took it in the first place!
Ethan Hawke was awesome in this
Love how they will probably never do Wakanda Forever. They’ve gotten soft and are afraid of cancel culture 💀
0:58 honoring the great Edith Head.
Blanc figuring the whole mystery Miles had set up before they even started the game was the best part of an already great movie.
I think “breaking the biggest thing” was referring to The Last Jedi.
5:49 *your Hyams references.  (or Clarke references, but that's not cinematic)
This movie was great...all the way up until everyone survived a massive explosion.  The concussive force alone should've wrecked everyone in there, let alone the heat that would have done much more than start some randomly placed fires (that miraculously didn't include anybody's clothes, despite those being some of the most flammable things present).  It was just a forced happy ending when, for a short moment, I enjoyed the bittersweet ending of Helen just ending her life by blowing away the entire corrupt group because there was no other way to stop them.
"this movie and its director are secretly genius" Proceeds to sin the movie for all the stupid contrived plot convivences that happen. Was this a joke I just missed?
one must keep in mind that this movies entire point is making fun of what I call Faux Intellectualism. A good puzzle is one where the methods are either avaialble to the solver or are based in common understanding. Faux Intellectualism is where a piece exists for either incredibly niche groups or as a way for the creator to try and prove how far supiror their intellect is. Or Artistic Masterbation. SO this movie exists as a satire to the modern Mystery Gen as a whole and its asinine, overly convoluted and hyperbolic bs that not a good mystery make.
SIN PROPOSAL if part of the solution came from  MILES BRON DONT HAVE A PHONE OR COMPUTER BUT USE FAX  how can he give blanc an ipad ???
This video is so dumb, it's brilliant. BB: "No, it's just dumb!" Can't argue with him, also I don't really want to.
I was so excited for this after I saw that cinemawins was covered it
Jessica Henwick isn’t my wife in this timeline
The producers gonna need betterhelp once he's done
And Miles only burns the napkin because he was literally too stupid to burn the evidence and only burned after Lionel gave him the idea, because literally nothing in Miles life is his own work. 😂😂   I was expecting sins off or at least jokes about the made up words 😂
that's why i love hotels. you can just leave the water running on a slow enough flow to negate the out flow.
m surprised CS liked this movie. Its full of crappy twists, re-edited shots to make you think there was something that wasnt... and the ending wasnt that great. Nothing was solved. just smash your way through it... woo...
awwww i love fugues lol
What nerve of Cinemasins to become anti art towards this art-  *remembers the anti art towards the glass sculptures*  Oh wait…
who want that lbox like me ??
3:37 "sins for these legends no longer being among us" Oh, no you didn't.
Just gonna mentally remove every sin that can be explained by the simple fact that Miles is an idiot, so his idiocy is literally explained.
2010: The Year We Made Contact isn't a Kubrick. It's based on the sequel to the book and is a very different movie. (For one thing, it makes sense.)
the stupid 1 is that dead woman.
esse filme é ruim demais o ryan nao sabe fazer filme kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk
this movie was the most MEH thing ever made
All I want to say is I saw a twin of that trippy ass sculpture in his office at the Palm Springs Museum of Art, and it's even crazier in person. Its by Artist Anthony James.
The absolute biggest contrivance of this movie was Duke learning Andi was dead moments after speaking with her and having no reaction other than, "how can I blackmail Miles with this"?
Benoit Blanc may (supposedly) be one of the world's greatest detectives, but TBH, he's got nothing on CinemaSins, who notices the tiniest detail such as an uncapitalised "i" in an email title.
I really enjoyed this movie. Part of ehy this movie speaks to me is due to personal experience but it is truly a deep film about greed, lust for power, and complacency. Like Nope, this isn't going to be a film solely for viewing pleasure. It required the audience to think deeply about references, characters, and character motivations. And Knives Out had as much social commentary.
So here's a thing you missed, but I can't blame you for.  They say the boat can't come because of the "tide", however the whole thing is set on the Mediterranean (Greece specifically) where the effect of tides is so minor as to be inconsequential. Certainly wouldn't have stopped a boat from travelling... (source: public knowledge)
Do Babylon next
Nah man. The breaking all the rich guys toys that he doesn't give a shit about was the point. He doesn't appreciate the art, it's just stuff to him.
Everything I loved about Knives Out was stripped away or bastardized in the Glass Onion. Glass Onion was incredibly contrived, cliche while not being clever, filled with horrible dialogue, packed with immediately dated references... I LOVED Knives Out, I regret watching Glass Onion.
This has more celeb-cameos than a fucking Muppet movie.
I loved the first one, didn't like this one at all. But all the commentary videos about it are so fun to watch.
BetterHelp is still a scam site that tricks people into using the site for "mental health" so they can sell their information.  They've been caught doing this multiple times.      **DING**
Honestly, it's a decent movie. But it's really not as intelligent or deep as it is praised for. Almost every breakthrough in the plot is contrived or giga-convenient. I'm so glad CinemaSins pointed out all the nonsense.
What I absolutely loved about this movie is the continuous use of the Fuge as a musical undertone to reinforce the idea of the glass onion; extra layers but it's all in the core  I also noticed Miles hand Duke his drink on the first watch and was still thoroughly confused until the end of the movie 😂
Lol I did not enjoy this movie! The twin plot was silly and wasted. She definitely should’ve been a evil twin
Last time I was this early I owed child support...
You guys are like yin and yang
Its a pit that this is only on netflix instead of having it on dvd/bluray because ore people need to watch this.
at least there wasn't a comcast sin
https://youtu.be/KqHDXk3Mibw?t=982  Assesability is 'corrected' to accessibility in the later reveal and in slightly different handwriting
Biggest sin to me is not acknowledging one bit the one-sided travel ban that Greece and a lot of Europe was under at the time, that allowed US people to visit it freely but had these banned countries' citizens forbidden entry into the US for almost 2 years. For a franchise that prides itself into lampshading inequalities they really didn't give a shit about that one.
Honestly believe everything will called "zooming" including schooling, people are in love with it😂
Roll onionits!
The thumbnail had to be one of a presumably naked old guy in the bath looking at his laptop. Funny, I don't care.
If Duke was deathly allergic to pineapple why didn't he have an epi pen on him at all times?
6:50 Red pill is only referenced in films to sign post any vaguely conservative strawman. It's just a laugh track for being offended  So yeah, it's sinful, but it's more deeply stupid than you gave it credit for
Baths are disgusting. Shower and clean up first maybe. Then if you need to feel indulgent and waste water, have a bath...
This is brilliant
the Hamilton reference at 23:21 lmao
i'm getting real tired of seeing betterhelp ads. they are not a good company at all. it's just unfortunate that they're really the only company that offers mental health services via telehealth nowadays cuz no one can really compete
Nice
2:32 this movie is stealing from a lots of movies
Can you do scream vi
It exists is enough for me.
Rian Johnson IS Miles Bron. he flashes a lot of references and clever schtick for attention, but is just gaming the social media narratives to get ahead. His movies were better before 2017. his movies have no more passion or soul, as they use sociopolitical narratives and references as shortcuts to making people feel like a movie has any relevance or teeth.  all his movies end with such petty angst. this one pivots on a smart guy being called a dumb fraud, as if it's a revelation or the first time we've seen that in a movie.  remember how Brothers Bloom ended? it turned brown
Trash movie
Love the way this movie deconstructs how people view society's mega-billionaires as superhuman geniuses
It was made by Ryan Johnson, enough said
23:50 she can't go straight for the mona...the glass stuff is just distraction, to make it seem like she's throwing a hissy fit and keep his guard down
23:00 yes, but ALL of those things rely on those people being willing to testify against him...and he makes sure he can rely on their silence. there is no PHYSICAL evidence
20:20  Ok there is a cheat there. In the actual scene where she got shot her suit was covered in blood.
This movie is why Rian Johnson is not my favorite director. It’s got great performances and writing but also incredibly stupid moments and frustrating writing. I think when your character is calling out how stupid your own ideas are, I don’t think that’s good writing
Extra sin: Daniel Craig was employed to do this movie
21:17 i'm not going to pretend that i figured out everything in this movie, but yeah, i DID notice ed norton handing him the glass...i even made my family pause and rewind the movie later on when he lied about it, just to make sure i wasn't losing my mind. i admit, i probably wouldn't have noticed if i wasn't watching a murder mystery, but yeah, at least one person did notice it when it happened
Jackie Hoffman is like 10 years older than Dave Bautista
6:42. Rian Johnson: "Break Star Wars and Luke Skywalker. then you will be such an out of the box thinker"
This is the anti-billionaire movie that Jurassic World Dominion thought it was achieving
It feels like Rian Johnson has a lot of contempt for moviegoers and the screenwriting in his last few films is evidence of that imo.
Rian Johnson: "A woman smashed a box. That's symbolic. THAT'S SYMBOLIC I SAID. IT'S A SUBTLE FORESHADOWING SYMBOLIC METAPHOR I CAME UP WITH. IT'S SUBTLE FORESHADOWING!!!! IT'S MEANINGFUL!!!!! NOTICE IT!!!"  Jeremy: "😱 genius"
The shooting having no real motivation is the biggest sin of the movie. He was the only one with no reason to shoot her this movie was way too random to be a decent mistory.
i love watching a cinema sins video right after cinema wins. it reminds me why i should be a pessimist :)
Next week: 2013 Evil Dead and which one?
2:20, I had heard that but she always turned me down
I love that they are all breaking glass items with most of the cast wearing sandals and open toed shoes but no one mentions stepping on glass, getting cut, or even that the glass shards ripped a hole in the sandals. These are thin and flimsy shoes! Everyone should be limping out with glass stuck in their feet
He was renting the Mona Lisa, that's why he would get in so much trouble for it getting destroyed.
I'd add sins for them playing Among Us at that age, then another sin for them playing Among Us.
kind of bummed that y'all are still using betterhelp as a major sponsor when there has been ton of news surrounding how awful they are as a company. mental health and providing mental healthcare should be a priority, but not through avenues like betterhelp that exploit workers and users alike.
3:22 My reaction to the entire movie. Also, ngl, I would've opened the box the exact same way. I don't care if whatever is in the box is fragile, I'll piece it together to see what it would've been.
I'm not a huge fan of this movie but I respect some of the people who are. Glad you liked it!
9:53 That was basically Peg’s situation this entire movie lol
DONG
This movie is revolutionary, even though it has a dead meme in it 😊
I would add a sin for when Miles and Blanc entered his office, and Miles said something along the lines of his car being a one-off. That car was a Porsche 918, which was mass-produced in the early 2010s.
I find it incredibly fascinating how some are torn on this film between getting behind it's own sense of self-awareness and snark or finding it to be smug and thinking it's smarter than it actually is. It's been a really interesting battlefield and for better or for worse, never say Rian does make films these days that don't engender some kind of strong feeling.
This movie nailed so many aspects to create a masterful and riveting murder mystery with the exception of Helen leaving the hammer in the box.
It will take time for me to understand why this film and the first one are so popular.
You talked about Miles having the Mona Lisa but you don't point out that he also has a painting of Tyler Durden on the wall. Ding!
Your jokes are cringe you guys fell off.
Funny movie
The last time I was this early they were sinning osmosis jones
Sometimes these movie names are hilarious asl.
Click-toris made me laugh way harder than it should’ve, thanks CinemaSins 😂
That's the image you chose for the thumbnail huh?
This movie is such an awful excuse for a murder mystery
10:59 That's one sin on you for not calling it the Pineapple Express
This movie was so awful. So many plot holes. Biggest one, how did none of her close friends know she had a twin sister? So many more problems. Filled with sins.
Ooh I’m early
Rian Johnson went all out with the budget in this one
Finally! I’ve been waiting for this for *SO LONG!*
2:23 "F*cking Jackie Hoffman is the best" ... uh ... phrasing ?!
Do 'Signs' man, sin that shit
Rian Johnson should give up the idea of making more STAR WARS movies and focus on original projects instead
This movie was fun to watch. The sins were even more fun 😂
I shouldn't  be this late
Oh my oh my
Glass onion a great movie and Beatles song
I’ve been waiting for this. This is perfect!!
No one has watched this video all the way though yet
I would love to see you guys cover Cocaine Bear
Be careful about BetterHelp. A friend of mine used to work with them, and they sell information of both patients and practitioners. They’ve been called out about it before, but the language that they changed in their contract does not sufficiently protect patient information.  EDIT: I think I should mention this is the info as I knew it from 2 years ago. If there was updated info that sufficiently protects both practitioners and clients, I’ve never heard of it but it needs to be considered.
Me and my girl friend were watching a film the other day and both started pulling it to pieces, we looked at each other and said we watch too much cineSins
I watched this for the first time last night, and this isn’t the first time cinemasins has uploaded a video the day after I’ve watched a movie. I’m scared
GODDAMM IT!!!!!!!!! WHERE ARE THE SINS FOR WAKANDA FOREVER!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?
I really just want a sin removal for Blanc's frustrated rant towards Bron's stupid plan and further frustration to Birdie's "So dumb, it's brilliant" comment.
It was hilarious yes but as a murder mystery it's awful
614th veiwer
Kathryn Hahn and Kate Hudson were also in "How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days" together, so this is a reunion, of sorts!
A number of whiny crying always complaining anti-sjw apparently didn't like this movie. But of course we all know they live to complain but of course the whole everybody else snowflakes❄️
The week after cinema wins video can't be a coincidence
Horror remake sins? As I expected. I know which movie that cinemasins is gonna sin.
Epic Beatles reference, Jeremy
The problem with Glass Onion is that it’s directed by Ryan Johnson, the guy who brought us the mediocre TLJ.
I'm early
i love how among us of all things has genuine relevance to the plot of mfin benoit blanc's life
Yessssss!
James Bond on vacation 😜
This movie was way too dumb, the plot and twists have no logical ground to stand on and I don't understand why people seem to like this movie. Watch the critical drinker's review for a good idea of how dumb this movie is
48
Third
Careful with better help everyone, they are being sued at the moment for selling/giving user information to marketing firms. Not really the sort of thing you'd want a therapy service to be doing. Just google it as I can't inject a link here.    Therapy is a great idea and really helpful for most people, just go somewhere other than Better Help or a lot of the other online service one who do the same thing. Just investigate before signing up.
I just want the cinemasins guy to be my therapist
On my watch list
Pls sin Scream 3 and 6
Early
Yyyyyyyyyyyaaaaaaaasssssssssss
Wow
are you ever going to review series?
love the vids
Second.
Congrats to Everybody who is here in time to find this comment 🎉
Did you really have to use Dunce at 9:35? As a Duntz, that annoys me.
