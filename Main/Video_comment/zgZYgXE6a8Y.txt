I'm amazed that I haven't seen a single comment referencing Wild Target. That movie is one of my favorites.
The line from Edge of Tomorrow that really stuck with me was "Have I got something on my face, soldier?"
What, no The Young Victoria?! Bit disappointed that one wasn't included; would have been cool to see some of her really early performances as well, such as in episodes of Foyle's War and Agatha Christie's Poirot
No Young Victoria or Into the Woods???
I love her calm demeanor.
I also enjoyed her on Looper.
jungle cruise is the best, Emily is the best, although i haven't seen most of these films lol.
Everyone that works in fashion is superficial.
Sicario???
What a beauty.
The fact no quote or song from Into The Woods isn’t on here is a crime.
The doctor who did her cheek fillers or implants must go to jail.
Makes sense that the lines that are hardest to recall were ones done in a recording studio and not on set.
She is so simpatica!
“I did what most people do in the gym, which is wonder around, checking my phone.” 😆 I’m not the only one then.  But then you met Tom Cruise. 🤣  And he made you WORK for a living, right?  Cruise is possibly the most, “intense,” artist alive today.  But everybody ups their game in his presence.  And it is a great movie.
Oh no,how can she forget  the MLP movie line  :3
Thank you.
She’s so pretty
They had so many lines to choose from with the movie A Quiet Place.
She is just such a treat!
Jungle cruise sucked i fell asleep in the theatre.
The first time I watched Emily was in the Young Victoria, my all time favorite, but anything she does is my favorite❤
Bet Emily is glad JA turned down the role taken by Angela Lansbury🎩
big fan of her voice of tempest from my little pony the movie
Not gonna lie I was kinda waiting for Into the Woods
Love Edge of Tomorrow.
Me encanta ❤❤❤ Emily blunt ❤❤❤
I'm glad they put my little pony too. Usually, they don't put this kind of movies in this type of videos.  But just to say, it's the only one where they haven't put the whole clip for the line, and tempest shadow had some other better lines
1:33
If all actors were as grounded as Emily, Hollywood would be in a better place.
Anytime I watch "The Devil Wears Prada" I think about how much that movie had done for its four principal cast members: 1.) Anne Hathaway proved her acting skills far exceeded "The Princess Diaries." 2.) Emily Blunt established herself as an actress; this film also catapulted her career to new heights and introduced her to her husband John Krasinski. 3.) Meryl Streep earned a record setting fourteenth Oscar nomination. 4.) Stanley Tucci met Emily's sister Felicity at Emily and John's wedding, meaning he and Emily are in-laws. Stanley was extremely hesitant to start dating again and even marry Felicity because when he met her it had been a few months after his first wife Kate had died from breast cancer.
Emily du bist sehr schön❤❤❤❤❤❤❤💋💋💋
Exe
Theres that one " i dont believe in equality, i believe in equity" 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Too bad she is a tobacco-drug addict.
My favourite is Wild Target with her and Bill Nighy. So funny, typically British with its dark humour.
#0:46 If you told me that was Jennifer Lawrence I wouldn't question it.
i love her react when read the card 😆  she's so cute
I have an Angel of Verdun recruitment poster on my wall
7:42 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Wild mountain thyme~ a BEAUTIFUL Film!! Incredible. Love her acting, her role there.together with Jamie Dornan. And her singing! Respect. Absolute loveable . Watch it again and again every year since I watch it for the first time. Its special.    Greetings  :)
The girl on the train I instantly knew since I’ve watched it a million times
Wow I forgot she was in Boudica with Alex Kingston!
It was so interesting! Thank you ❤
You should give some helpline. 😅
This concept is so stupid, for her those films was a job, a way to earn money, she read the script, said the lines to the camera, and then she never has to bother thinking about those lines ever again, unless some idiot fan stop her in the street and yell those lines at her, because people are so moronic that they can't tell the difference between actors and characters  Case in point Arnold Schwarzenegger and Danny DeVito being asked if they are related, on account of them having been twins in a movie - It's pretend, the filmmakers made it up
Enjoyed this interview, but should change the title to movies/TV and mentioend a TV episode!
“No. Shan’t”…iconic! My wife and I still use this all the time! “Can you pick up some bread while you are out honey”….”No. Shan’t”.  😀
The English should have been featured! She was excellent in it. The series was incredible.
She's so beautiful
Her calling it All You Need Is Kill after the manga is so cool. Wish they made an Edge of Tomorrow sequel, amazing movie.
She is without doubt the most stunningly beautiful woman on the planet. John Krasinski hit the jackpot
My gosh what an amazing person she is!
Too much botox.
Overrated. A bit too much.
love her and wish she talked about into the woods
I’m getting Kermit vibes from that top😮💚🐸
you forgot Jane Austen book club
I loved this one, Emily is such a joy to watch! Her reactions were really funny! And her range of films is amazing! I'd forgot how many she's done until watching this
AI generated caption titles are wrong... 0:25 Devil Wears Prada not Double W. 1:16 is Oppenheimer not Prometheus. 4:53 - please (missing e) 5:32 - My little pony not Parties. 6:17 - The Girl on the train not Tempest 8:34 - Boudica not When we catch him 😂🤷‍♂
Come on Emily, you smashed it.
I love how versatile she is! Emily Blunt is one of the best actors in the entire world. When you see her in Edge of Tomorrow and The Devil Wears Prada you can't say that it's the same person, it's completely different.  Just love her. <3
She should stop with botox...
https://youtu.be/TVure-y4RpA?si=16uXGKcCfaIjNw9I  She thinks she is much better than rest of Americans
her outfit makes her look like kermit the frog and i cannot unsee it and now you can't either
Her instinct to touch the card under her chin is quite funny
She ruined her face
6:38 "is it some random one again?" referring to my little ponies?! you've been in too much if you think ponies is random! :)
is it some random one hahahahahaha
Emily Blunt married that guy who advocates things such as torture, forced interrogation, the Afghanistan War etc and US foreign policy in general and is a straight up CIA propagandist. Other than that, she seems like an actually nice person. Emily seems nice!
Where is "I recommend the pecan pie"?
SHES BEEN IN SO MUCH THAT I HAVENT RECOGNISED HER IN ALL HER WORK i thought she was a different person in each movie
I feel the need for a film with Emily Blunt and Emma Thompson as the leads. Dramatic or comedic, I don't care. I just need that combination of talents in my life.
She is so genuine
Edge of Tomorrow is SO good.  Is there going to be a sequel?  Heard rumblings…
Such a wonderful soul!
Still needed a line from Sicario. She was uhhhmazing in that movie!!
Love her!!! 😍😍😍
"He looks at me like he's the spoon and I'm the dish of ice cream" - Emily Blunt as Prudie in "The Jane Austen Book Club".
Into the woods???
Comes over very well (Likeable), not all actors do that when interviewed
So sad to see, such a genuine person full of botox and fillers. Her face does not move during this.
She is such a joyous person. I love her.
Oopsy doopsy I muffed it up again
Edge of Tomorrow 2 PLEASE
Genre queen!
Too sexy and too skilled to watch her without getting crazy
Forgot how well Emily blunt does annoying woman in some movies when called upon. She’s great though.
Emily is soooo adorable 🥰
Love her but her face tweaks distract :(
I waited for her line from The Hunstman: Winter's War. All of my girls were there: Jessica, Charlize, and Emily.
I have been binge watching Emily Blunt interviews ❤😅
Ive been a huge fan ever since she carried Girl on The Train on her back. I left that movie thinking "Wow, she kept this movie alive."
I understand why my man Krazinsk lost himself on her. She is one for the ages.
Her versatility with all good actors n actress is incredible
Interesting that she only missed the two lines where she wasn't interacting with another actor.
Are you wearing...?
And yet her character is basically reduced to the wife dropping alcohol bottles from her purse. Nolan just can't seem to crack a deep, interesting female character.
Sicario is one of her best movies! Missing from this.
In The Devil Wears Prada, Emily is strikingly similar to Jennifer Lawrence
Happy birthday,Emily.
Happy birthday,Emily.
No Sicario, what a shame
why she wear the grinch shirt
a list of banging films
Wanted to see if she remembered a quote from Looper
😅
Does Emily Blunt know Blunt means weed for some
We got Boudica and MLP but not fuckin LOOPER or Sicario? C'mon man. Ah well lmao
the question is what is V.H.? it should've been E.B? or maybe her hubby J.K.? 🤔
Same face selena gomez
So happy to hear my fav actor speak about anything! #giveheranOscarlikeyesterday  But also the fact that one of these is "The Five Year Engagement" is AMAZING! Imo it's a top 5 romcom, which may be a hot take, but her & Jason Segel are sweet, chaotic delight together. Also it's a genuine comedy, which if you think about it is rare for the genre.
the range of expressions and funny faces that she does... not knowing the movie... born to be a actress. love her
is that botox on her face? her cheeks look larger
An icon, not unlike Streep, and sings too
I was really hoping for a Ruthie Draper line ...........
''I think I'd just been dressing like a teenage boy until that happened'' Now she wears the latest in kermit the frog costuming!
Mad respect to the actors and actresses that put themselves out there for this series.  Makes me respect them even more.
She’s absolutely lovely
She wasnt in promethius
She looks like Madonna now. Why the hell she wanted to mess with her face so much
Hi from Romania❤
Good lord, Cillian's eyes control the stage.
Totally awesome 👍
Woah her voice acting for My Little Pony is amazing
💙
Shes overdoing the botox and fillers a tiny bit.  I love her.  Genuinely hate seeing them ruin their faces.  Judy Dench aged natually and that is why you believe èver role she plays
1:27 Wow Umiversal pictures sure had a great year 😂
Can’t believe I didn’t get the MLP quote even though I am a fan! Although the movie itself was pretty mediocre to bad unlike the series and next gen film. Her character’s song in the movie is amazing however
I was today years old when I found out Emily played one of my favourite historical characters
Loving the Kermit sweater 💚
I laughed out loud for her joke on Edge of Tomorrow has many titles.
EDGE OF TOMORROW = MASTERPIECE
Nothing from Sicario???!!!  Here greatest and bravest role as Kate Macer!!
I love her but this outfit is giving Kermit the frog
anyone notice her earrings are "V" and "H" for her daughters violet and hazel?
Edge of tomorrow I don’t know why but I really loved that movie 😍💙
How can you not love Emily Blunt?! She's such a QUEEN. I love her V and H earrings for her daughters 💓
My fave movie of hers is still looper but I also loved her in the quiet place
she's such an amazing actress she's so versatile!  also-someone did her dirty with the bronzer!
My wife and I love Emily she is one of our favorite actors. I just call her "angel of Verdun" anytime she's in a new movie lol. "Honey, new movie with the Angel of Verdun!"😂
When we catch him, want you to set me on fire?  Sounds like that line needed a rework.  lol
Gotta love her!
Emily Blunt ❤
Fun but not necessary still might show if she was invested in the movie or not.
She remembered everything she said on a set and forgot what she said in a sound booth.
I adore her. She and John K are my favorite couple in entertainment. They are perfect together.
Dang, no lines from The English?! That show broke my Heart. Continuously. But so good. Really stays with you for a bit afterwards.
Actors genuinely believe normal people  have no deep feelings or complexity.
Aww the initials of her children on  her ears
How can you NOT love Emily Blunt. Johnny K is a lucky guy.
Love her! One of the few actreses how will not take a role of the "Strong female caracter" with " The Message" even for a big money.
The difference between just reading the line and how it was acted by the very same person is just mind-blowing
I love Emily Blunt! ❤️ There are more of her films I need to see 😊
I love her graciousness. Any time I see her in interviews she has that same kindness and graciousness
RIP Emily Blunts face, nice to meet you facemask
Man, I wish we could somehow see more of her from edge of tomorrow. Maybe a prequel were we see her adventures.
I really want to like Emily Blunt. I love her films and I envy her composure and poise, but I just can't get past the interview she did with Jonathan Ross where she was so so so cruel about an overweight waitress. Cannot get past it!
I can see how underrated Wild Mountain Tyme is that it wasn't featured nor discussed about. I loved it so much.
"Wondering around...checking their phone.." - Got that right :)
Our boy Jim hit that.
Emily Blunt is always a delight.
Botox galore
Katherine Oppenheimer was NOT a ''non-conformist'', she was a misguided communist while soviet union was murdering and oppressing MILLIONS. She willingly ignored the reality to placate her own ego (as all those wannabe communists did). She never made an effort to know what life under communism really was, she did not care (as pretty much every out-of-touch intellectual who sympathized with communism). Ideological successor of soviet union, russian federation, continues to commit genocide, invade, oppress and exterminate people so I am indignant at anyone calling a stupid commie ''non-conformist''. You have to be either very stupid or a horrible person to be a commie therefore Katherine was not so bright or good of a person, no need to put her on pedestal Emily.
She’s one the most talented people in Hollywood. She’s beautiful, she can sing, she can act, she’s fucking hilarious, she’s done action movies… and outside of that when you see her or people mention her she’s like the NICEST people in the world. I hope nothing for the best for this woman and she’s got my support
The kindness and humility are so endearing... I'm such a fan... 🎉
Emily was born not far from me and I have followed her work, she is just Class and gives every role 100%
539k views and at this point 0 dislikes? How rare is that? Emily just too likeable.
Emily blunt is fuckin perfect . She has the perfect life . I love her . Jealous as hell
She looks like Kermit the Frog in that sweater.
A couple of the ones selected here were from her early years and not major enough to note (like the old TV film Boudaca - her recent acclaimed TV series The English should've been here instead). It should've included more of her iconic and major films and roles. Apart from Oppenheimer, Devil Wears Prada, Edge of Tomorrow, A Quiet Place, Mary Poppins, there's also Sicario, The English, Into The Woods, Looper, The Young Victoria, The Huntsman, and her first film My Summer of Love too, where she also had some great lines.
What a cool woman  she is 😊
This woman is the love of my life 💕💕
Thank you for spoiler for A quiet place 2- Had not seen it yet.
Get on up here and act like a husband.
she has so many good roles. Edge of Tomorrow, Looper, A Quiet Place, Sicario and The Adjustment Bureau are my favourites of hers.
I love Emily but the cheek filler is too much. She didn’t need it, nor the lip filler. She was already beautiful.
Where was 'Whoops-a-daisy, I muffed it up again?' Very disappointing...
No quotes from the Jane Austin Book Club? Shame but  still love E. Blunt
Too much botox.
How come she was so pale in devil wears prada but shes so tan ever since
I was actually waiting, hoping and expecting one of the lines to be from The Huntsman, one of my favorite movies from her, she did amazing as the Ice Queen.
She looks lovely but that top does make her look like she's cosplaying Kermit the Frog.
No Sicario?! Why?!
The way i didnt even know she was in devil wears prada and i love that movie, the range
My favorite Movies she’s in are The Huntsman Winters War, Jungle Cruise and Mary Poppins
Girl on the Train wss great! Quiet Place 1 snd 2 were great!.
Nothing from 'Sicario'. 😠👿
it's 'umiversal' pictures for me.
Why so much plastic surgery
0 dislike so far, keep it up
Besides obviously how talented and gorgeous she is, I can hear her talk all day I love her accent and the way she sounds so elegant. I wish I can talk like her lol
Wait, was Emily Blunt in Romania? So cool!
👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
She is so lovely in "Devil wears Prada"  😍 🥰
Five Year Engagement is one my favorite movies.
She looked so bad ass and formidable in Edge of Tomorrow ❤
Oh no. What’s she done to her face?
Her entire forehead is frozen!!!
Does she know how to say #CEASEFIRE  ?
Her earring with her daughter’s initials ❤ Violet and Hazel ❤
I love Emily Cunt, I mean Blunt
WHHHAAATTTT i never realized that was Emily Blunt in Devil Wesrs Prada!!!
Sicario is so underrated
How has she not gotten an Oscar nod yet is baffling to me? ESP for A Quiet Place! She is so so brilliant in emotions
I love her
While rewatching, "Agatha Christie's Poirot" on BritBox, a young Emily Blunt came across my screen!! 😲 She played "Linnet" for the episode movie, "Death on the Nile". I think her character snubbed Hercule Poirot played by David Suchet.  For any future flashbacks, add a scene from this series! Thank you, Ms. Blunt!
Did she get cheek implants or do something with her face? She looks completely different if you compare her to old pictures
I remember Julie Andrew’s as Mary Poppins. And I can absolutely understand how she must have been terrified.  But she did an amazing job! She didn’t try to do Julie Andrew’s doing Mary Poppins, she made the role her own! It was an absolute pleasure to watch.
She’s such an amazing actor. She will get her Oscar.
This is hilarious to me because it really underlines the variance of her filmography. I once talked about how much I liked her to a guy and we compared movies and there was maybe one movie we had both seen.
She’s so versatile and wise. Wonderful actress! 💙🫶🏼
I'm a big fan of Emily Blunt
SHE VOICED TEMPEST SHADOW!??! THAT WAS MY FAVOURITE MLP MOVIES HOLY SHI-
She missed only voice over lines.  Actually being in the scene makes things more memorable!  Just being in front of a mic, you can basically read the lines instead of memorizing. Makes sense. I do hope they do this with other actors.  This is rather fun to see!
was waiting for a sicario line. emily is great.
6:49 I need to watch that. This line. The music. I am convinced
Love this! She is is a great teller. She said something fascinating about every character, role. Now I need to watch the movies that I didn't watch from this
Random thing here. The movie edge of tomorrow has multiple names because the original name was Live Die Repeat. It’s based off a Japanese manga of the same name.
Excellent actress, but she's changed her face so much (botox? Fillers?) that I didn't recognize her.
How many fillers  ( or rather  implants!?) do you want in your mid- face  area? Emily: YES!!
I just realized that i watched all her movies, and I'm proud of myself
I can't  be the only one who is totally  shocked about how her whole facial structure has changed?!!!😮😮😮 That cheek area looks so weird
very interesting
are the V and H earrings she is wearing supposed to stand for her kids' initials? 🥺
Omg variety just has the best interview ideas😍😍
❤ my favourite Hollywood actor, so beautiful, down to earth and also well dress always.
The only movie of Emily's that i didnt like was The Girl on the Train, but it definitely has nothing to do with her performance. I just read the book before i saw the movie, and i liked it so much better. But Emily Blunt is great in everything she's in.
I love her but that sweater looks like Kermit the frog......i need it
"Umiversal Films"
What did she do to her face 😩😩
So I've never watch Devil Wears Prada and I thought wow that looks a lot like Billie Eilish when they dyed their hair red and have thick eye liner and then the whole video I couldn't stop seeing how much these two people resemble each other.
I love this woman! So charismatic!
I would love you get her to read a Sicario quote line... that was an experience of a movie
7:19 just come here to see this
That scene on the beach in Edge of Tomorrow where Rita comes out of the crashed plane in the exo suit and still whoops a few mimics asses without having the foresight anymore, so f*cking cool.
She is the Kareena Kapoor of Hollywood
How bout her role of the Baker’s Wife in Into the Woods! I hadn’t realized how much she’s really been in wow, what a difference she makes playing each character :)
she HAS to lay off the plastic surgery, she looks pulled tight like rubber its not good
She owns "playing a badass female without beeing written as a mary sue" and her acting is always onpoint. Shes among the top 10 female actors of all time imho.
The way I screamed MLP lol 😆
Edge of tomorrow, the best ❤❤❤❤ Love her ❤❤❤❤
Emily Blunt is one of the best actresses of this age with such good range!
It's like she's trying to hug the circumference of the Earth with her new cheeks.
great!
I reeeeeeaaaaally liked Wild Mountain Thyme. I didn’t know what to expect and it was so fun. She’s great.
She’s so lovely.
Did anyone notice her V and H earrings? So cute!
emily blunt is one of a kind. love her!
where was into the woods??😪
She’s just lovely.
Edge of Tomorrow is so good T_T  Where is the sequel??
Admittedly proud of myself for knowing the Oppenheimer line after seeing it one time but then again it was my absolute favorite line from her. So much truth and strength from her character in that scene and totally badass! I also particularly loved her performance during a moment toward the end of the story in their back yard I think it was. She understands nuance and subtlety and delivers so much with seemingly very little. Brilliant job, beautifully crafted film.
I just love her
I would die to see her cast as a mature Lara Croft. I loved her in Edge of tomorrow or Live die repeat lol.
The fact that she got so excited when quoting the Devil Wears Prada… I love it❤
I love Emily Blunt! Fantastic actress and a lovely human being! Really enjoyed this 👏🏻👏🏻
sad to see she's going down the nicole kidman path 😞
Watching her explain her roles so eloquently is always amazing to see! Such big range for an actress and surprised she's not given more roles in the industry!! 🥹🖤
Emily is a GEM! She’s one of my favorite actresses, she’s so good in every movie. I hope one day she wins an Oscar❤❤❤
Love that her earrings in this interview are the first letters of  her daughters’ names: Hazel and Violet! So sweet.
6:31 6:33 . 7:02 8:08
0:55 talk boo who write. 1:07 0:50 y no werkingv4 bad.
Who no theres rules to life.pple having to say what is
I love her, a great actress with a beautiful face so far, but I couldn't recognize her on TV once and if she continues with stupid fillers she will ruin her face and maybe her career, she already looks weird. To me, Madonna's appearance is repulsive, frivolous, I don't want to watch movies with such a face. Maybe she is being advised by the wrong people who want her career to fail. Please stop.
Her calling it All You Need Is Kill after the manga is so cool. Wish they made an Edge of Tomorrow sequel, amazing movie.
She seems genuine and grounded.
I have such a big crush on this beautiful woman...
I knew the "Girl on a Train" line.  Read the book, loved it.  Was iffy about the movie until I heard she was in it.
Let's not forget some idiots on the Internet tried to cancel this gem of a woman for telling an anecdote on a TV show where she called an enormous woman enormous. People, people, people...
Shocked they didn't include Sicario into the mix
I need to see a film where her and Elizabeth Reaser play sisters
Another actress who had so much work done that her face is looking like an alien.
She did such a good job with Girl on a Train. Quite a convincing portrayal of an alcoholic. Most actors overdo that type of role. I also really loved her in Adjustment Bureau with Matt Damon. Underrated movie.
Hey, Emily! Maybe don't be so good & star in so many good movies, and maybe you'll remember some of your lines! LoL 🤣 🇬🇧💕🌼 (her & John are my favorite Hollywood couple!) I can't believe SICARIO didn't make the video. 😑
love her comment on what 'most people do' in gyms: ...which is wander around and checking their phone 😂 Emily is a great actress and a most likable soul 🫶
Starting to get a bit of American accent slipping in there Em….😂
It's weird hearing some of them in her English accent.
Emily Blunt is one of the few actors in Hollywood who does every genre of films
No Sicario?
it’s kill-yen?
Those midface fillers need to be dissolved. So distracting from her beauty.
Before I finish PLEASE tell me they included “Ive never lied to royalty before” from Into the Woods.
You missed my fave role/movie from her, when shes SCREAMS: "High school is NEVER OVER!"
The Devil Wears Prada, Sunshine Cleaning, Young Victoria, The Wolfman, Adjustment Bureau, Salmon Fishing in the Yemen, Looper, The Wind Rises, Edge of Tomorrow, Sicario, & Oppenheimer all have wonderful Emily Blunt performances.
Вау, вау, вау! Зовсім не знала про флот Української республіки! Так круто зробили похід через Сиваш 😮  І як же хочеться, щоб ми навчилися з тих помилок із чварами - Україна понад усе! Єдина і вільна велика держава величних справжніх українців!!
I see her as Emily (TDWP). She is ICONIC!
My favorite character played by her is Rita Vrataski , Edge of tomorrow was a masterpiece , She and Tom Cruise did such a good job in this movie , i love how many emotions she can feel playing her characters
She is very beautiful
SHE IS ICONIC!
EMILY IS INCREDIBLE!
EMILY IS A GREAT ACTRESS!
IT'S EMILY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
the cheeks :(((
SHE DESERVES A OSCAR😍😍😍😍
So joyful woman. I adore her. And she is an EVERYDAY woman...
I love her for one main reason. She’s an English woman that came here to America and made millions. But also is loyal to and outspoken about how much she loves England, while insulting America lol . Respect! A true and real human being.
Her earrings are so cute the H and V for her daughters Hazel and Violet. My heart ❤️
sad there's no Sicario
You missed my fav movie of hers. Salmon Fishing in the Yemen!!
im gay but why am i so in love with her ❤
is she still fatphobic?
Oh I so wanted to hear a line from my favorite film of hers; My Sister's Sister. A must see if you haven't.
Oof the American accent is starting to creep in!!
She is fit ❤😂🎉😢😮😅
What’s not likeable about Emily blunt
Emily Blunt has always been my favourite! But now guessing her lines with her I’ve surprised myself at how well I know her films 😂😂 she’s just incredible
No, no, no... Emily. please stop with fillers before it's too late.
Love this ‘line guessing’ video! I want to see more!!
A fourth movie with Meryl please.
I want to see this with Penelope Cruz.
You are so wonderful and talented ❤
She’s so talented, LOVE HER!
Emily Blunt looks different now. More like...Kate Winslet?!😢
"I think I did what most people did at the gym: which is wondering around checking their phone" Yaassss. Iconic. You have to love her.
How did her fave get wider?
I just love Emily Blunt, Period. Point. Blank. 💕
I was really holding out for the adjustment bureau
her face work isn't working :(
So, no touching on Death on the Nile, Poirot?  That was the first time I noted Emily Blunt.  Ms Blunts performance as Linnet Ridgeway was soooo much better than Ms Gadot's though Emily Blunt had a better writer and director in her version.
Many actors play every part the same way. The actor is more recognizable than the characters. Emily is not that, she creates each character bigger than herself. Emily is movie making royalty. Also, she's and absolute doll, love her.
Jim is such a blessed man
I adore Emily Blunt!
I want her to win her Oscar for her Kitty Oppenheimer role.
The blepharoplasty jumped out in this video.
Of course she does. She’s not an idiot.
It was so nice of Emily to show up as Kermit ;)
Her cheeks looking very puffy! Why are women pressurised to get fillers? does she not know that we would love her with wrinkles?
I hope krasinsky is man enough to tell her "stop, with the botox". She's just about to tip over to cat woman.
The Angel of Verdun is an absolutely luscious character.
She is also amazing in Sicario
Wow, they’ve gone for some interesting costumes and style of filming for Mary Popins, I wonder what it will be like.
Edge of Tomorrow needs a sequel or prequel with Emily if Tom is too busy.
I can't believe there's no "Charlie Wiilson's War" ! still remember Emily her brilliant acting perform in that film & how Tom Hanks touched her belly.
That jumper is everything.so beautiful.
5:33 6:15 8:34 Emily forgot her own lines 😄
I’m only here for the devil wears Prada lines.
Great video and I love Emily Blunt she is a great actress.🤩
Love her so much, hope to see her more 🥹🩷
It’s disturbing how I’m able to quote Emily Charlton’s lines without much preparation. Thank you!
EMILY!!! ❤❤❤
Absolutely love A Quiet Place film! Love this!
I love EB but am so disappointed that she (and others) continues to glorify Tom Cruise, a cult leader who is responsible for the violent separation, bankruptcy and abuse of multiple families.
Omg, Hollywood needs to stop with the botox. Emily you were so pretty, why mess with your face???
Not having sicario in this is a sin...
She is such a gem😍
Emily's range as an actress is outstandingly incredible. ❤️
I love the Van Halen earring \nn/
❤❤❤❤
love her
I would have thought the fire one was Edge of Tomorrow if they hadn't done it already!
To bad Sicario wasn't in here.
John's a lucky man!!!Talented actress and terrific Lady 😀
The bit at 2:46 is destined to become a gif for trying to do something cool and it doesn't quite work out the way you wanted it to 😂.
I think she thinks she has had subtle work done. Her accent is mid-Atlantic. She needs to come home.
The V and H earrings 😍😍😍
Does  ms.blunt still remember the lines from the my little pony movie?
She has put some sh¡t in the sides of her face and looks like Madonna. Emily, you are beautiful without surgeries.
"is it like a TV thing" 😭
