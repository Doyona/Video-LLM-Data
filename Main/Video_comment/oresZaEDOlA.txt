E
Great. Now finish the game.
This vid_o is aw_som_ and I wish that p_opl_ did this chall_ng_ mor_
E
Just say "Da" instead of "The"
Bro arua farmed 1:20
Jesus Christ died for you on a cross and rose from the dead 3 days later. So that if you believe in him you can live with him in heaven for eternity.
If bro said 6'7 I would laugh so hard
now we need this video but its ONLY you saying words with the letter E in it.
Just dont speak
"I am skill!"   *falls*
You can say zilch aka zero
I feel pain for you from that
E
he really is a dumbass saying THE all the time, or there, lol
This moment is too hilarious 0:41
12:40 Why did the player do a little dance?
7:48  that cutoff killed me
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Why were there Radahns at 7:29?
Since when have you been playing Elden ring?!?!?! Love the vid tho❤
Dude is talking like an Elden Ring multiplayer message lmao
Respectfully: Don't support Garden of Eyes. They're notorious for stealing assets from other creators and monetizing assets made by Fromsoft which is against the ToS
Absolute CINEMA
6:26 he’s really starting to lose it isn’t heeeeeeee
Is Eric okay? Did he hit his on something and that’s why his a caveman now?
1:23 the way he just salutes at the camera while his character is looking at the meteor was funny AF
4:44 LMAOOOO
So funny 🤣  It's like you are a non english speaker trying to have a conversation in english 🤣
W ELDEN CROW
This man is awful at grammar.  Git gud at using words.
Is that just 4 radahns flying at my face for saying the?
It's funny because he's talking like the writings of actual Elden Ring messages
meteors ❌  radahns falling from sky ✅
This is how I speak English
5:28 I thought you said,"I don't kick a puppy," and kick that dog. (No that vowul in this part)
4:39
'missed it' KABOOM 😊
Nightreign when
Radahn is just chilling in the sky waiting for his que
Beat the game like this.
where can  get this mod
It’s Not a meteor it’s radahn 😂
Caveman run
w
just dont say anything duh
Every single time a letter is banned it sounds like you speak either as a caveman or yoda
I wanna try this mod 😂 I ABSOLUTELY WANT TO. Where can I find it ?
Ah yes, Margit is my favorite mini boss
Radahn headbutted us with this one🔥🔥
this challenged has reduced to man to speaking explicitly in orange soapstone messages
yeah...thats the basic elden ring exp
5:31 when im getting head from the bird girl but then she starts giving me straight beak
this was good till..10:40ish then u flopped embarrassingly I even turned the volume down paused to comment so I could get daphuc out of this video
Bro it took me like 25 attempts for Margot what you mean mini boss😭🙏
He kicked hundreds of puppies over the course of this video
Love from a DougDoug and  Vaush fan!
I don't understand how the meteor is just SO FUNNY every time
This reminds me a meme of sonic, tails, and knuckles   Tails talks without saying the letter e or having it in his vocabulary   And Knuckles just says "F-ck you."
8 meteors struck during the making of this title.
Bro has to speak in soul's messages
garden of eyes made this mod!?
Average Elden Ring player's comprehension of the english language
He said “that girl” and then an ad played saying “must go”😂
🐢
Bro was talking like te signs people place down  😂
Speaking like a cave man lol
the editing is so fucking good
TEll mE plEasE at lEast onE rEason to bE as Emotional as sEEn and hEard hErE. Is thErE EvEn any, dEarEst sirE? For ExamplE, I havE acquirEd mysElf arthErial hypErtEnsion in agE of ninEtEEn yEars or somEthing bEcausE of bEing too angErEd in gEnEral.
It’s funny that this is even a challenge considering most players play Elden Ring alone and without saying a word
My brain has never hurt so bad after watching this.
coulda said Zilch or Nada instead of Zero maybe?
Wow what a beautiful day 0:45
6:50 "Strat no work, big rock no kill" you can feel the pain in his tone  It sounds like a caveman after failing hunting with a rock
Dont know why but when you said nononono please please.. it reminded me of the song welcome to the jungle. Subbed.
I was hoping the ending text would have the ff14 endbringer meteor
“I can say that😁” 6:05
cool and all but now do it but with falling stars/ Consort's meteor shower instead,pure oblitiration
He could say "I don't kick any puppy
watch 5:70 in the video, its funny how you get so made yet you screech? hahaha
4:45 “I am skill” followed by the immediate death sends me
4:43 he is s k i l l guys
My favourite moment is just when you see so many radhans flying at him
Just don't speak..?
Instead of using “the” you could use thy
I am skill
He said e and didn’t die it’s thE classic
How to do the attack he did in 12:46 in playstation
So many meteors for never saying “the word E” great title. Saying The is not saying the letter E.
The way Pointcrow talks in this video is like how elden ring messages are left.
PointCrow: says E Redahn: THIS is the greeaaatesst plaaaaannn!~
"I Am Skill" Procedes To Fall To His Death After Falling On An Enemy 💀
apes together strong
4:38 Such an inspiring quote
I love how he's like: "m-      a-     the-BOOOSCH!!!"
Oh it’s made by garden of eyes  Fun….
i love how half the comments don’t realize the “massive cosmic rock” is just radahn
You can always switch to a non-Roman language, such as Arabic,  traditional Chinese, or maybe Hindi ?
i like to think radahn hates the letter "E" so much that hegets his sanity back just to kill anyone who says E
Couldn't you just say "da" as a replacement for "the"?
After actually playing the game and getting pretty far now... Is that "meteorite" Starscourge Radahn?
this videos thumbnail shouldve been "speaking like a caveman until me kill godrick"
i love the fact that the first ever letter that he said in this video was the letter "E"
why did puppy cross road? Pointcrow kick it
margit the fell omen is not a mini boss but a boss just being easier anyways when nightrein comes out teach your goldfish to beat its hardest boss
0:45 elden ring hard mode
BRINGOBUR
that’s music to my auditory organs
Pointcrow: I am skill. me: yeah skilled at kicking puppies
4:43 I……..AM STEVE (or king of skill ig idk)
4:43 I AM SKILL *dies* I WANT TO JUMP TO HOUSE
Frenzied Flame ost playing when this occurs
This is thy start
9:26 That's a poggers face if I've ever seen one
Were just gonna brush over the Markiplier Lord Farquaad are we?
bro you said your skilled but you mean at kicking puppies right
Are you getting- ARE YOU GETTING NUKED BY RADAHN???
Point crow you monster, twitch chat never lies we all know what you did to those poor puppies.
The meteorite is radahn
Wait the meteor is just Radahn lol
This entire video is legit just a subtle foreshadowing meme lmao
How is it that when he wasn't even trying, he said a whole sentence without E? "How do I do a sub plug, chat?" 2:08
i just realized the meteor was rahdan
Pro tip: say nothing
I was peacefully drinking tea when the worl exploded and i got tea out of my nose.
10:28 I love the Seinfeld references!😂😂😂
lol the meteor is literally just Radahn
More Elden ring
margit is a mini boss..?
Big boy dragon in Ohio
here comes the sun doodoodoo
The fact that he called Margit a mini boss has me tweaking
3:52 bad boys bad boys whatcha gonna do? whatcha gonna do when they come for you?
4:37 quite possibly the worst timing ever
In American Sign Language (ASL) there is a thing called GLOSS. This is a direct translation of ASL to English. If I were to sign the sentence “I GO HELL HELP” saying what I would sign just there is GLOSS.   Pointcrow was literally speaking in GLOSS.
Haha I translated the E comment and it turned to AND
Say thy instead of the
I love how it’s not even a meteor it’s just radahn giving you revenge every time you say E
I think my lung collapsed
unholy bird now is hole-ly
E
In this pointcrow film many puppy is chat's bad silly word
he could of said" thy" instead of "the"
Oh shoot! I don’t want a world to crack! So I should go to oh my this is hard to say!!!! Okay, calm down, don’t lost yours…. Think of anything… What? *LOL* what am I talking about? I had to think of any, no. That villain is trying to kill my own DMs officially…. It do not counts, I cannot say that part with that mouth.
Also you can go in the basement of agheel ruins and open the chest to get to caelid
8:21  the dragon is called Greyoil
These are your best videos
“I’ll kick any puppy there is” - Pointcrow
Eric will never beat the "the" allegations
outro song name requesting for a friend
just dont speak Easy win bro
Leave point crow alone radahn
You could ve used thy instead of the
Eric dodges the meteor, then says E again... 😂
HERE COMES THE SUN DO DO DO BIRD SCRECH 🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Brother  said e at the start so hard on purpose, bad acting
Y in Spanish is pronounced e and is the word for and
I love how he never tried to run or roll away just to make it less fun to watch
Bro, this is the only good version of this challenge. All the other streamers just use some super easy to not say word, like bear, or cop. (And yes, I know the bear was from point row too)
You know, I think he'd have saved himself just saying E when they asked in contrast to the amount of Es he used when defending himself
so you're the person who kicked my puppy
No offense but this video isn't that funny
Peak content😊
Bro had to speak like an Elden ring message
I am skill 😅 10:34
"i am skill"
0:45 Leaving for work in Hiroshima Japan 1945 8:16:02am
First minute and already: Opens Door, ARMAGEDDON
0:10 HE'S A MINIBOSS?!?!?!?!?!? I'VE BEEN STUCK ON HIM FOR LIKE A *WEEK*
i dont think the last boss got beaten in this vid XD
"Strat no work, big rock no kill - I kill Godrick"
I Imagine you going up to someone and trying to talk after this just to fuck up detrimentaly and forget you are allowed to pronounce the letter E
poor margit got downgraded to mini boss
Just don't speak...... no ?
The fact that it’s rahdan is so funny😭
Call caled by it,s normal na
You should of god the morning star to kill the dragon with combos it takes about five minutes but it’s still quick I guess, the dragon has like 5000hp
Puppies has an e in it
Totk is like Elden ring, think about the moves you can perform in either game it’s similar also think about the maps similarities
i love that you can see radahn in the meteor
7:30 That pack of radahns really seem to hate the letter e
THE PUPPIES WILL HAVE JUSTICE!!!
0:45 opening the door and greeting death 💀 😂
Hardest boss in Elden Ring: THE
3:22 you didnt say E you said the words with the letter E in them
E
Final Fantasy 7 REBIRTH but if you say M, E, T, A, O, or R, a meteor destroys the world, causing an TPK.
Bro have no mercy with puppies! 🐶
So elden ring but radahn is constantly abusing me
Him "e"  orbital strike imbound near your location
He sounds like he's speaking in Elden ring messages
I mean you can just activate meteors at every boss fight kinda boring ngl
Walks into arena "Die" *giant fucking meteor*
I like the idea of radahn just waiting in the sky for him to say an e word
👾
The fact radahn is the meteor 😭😭😭
You hurt my kind (a turtle) so i dislike ):l
4:43 "I am skill" *falls to their death*
I like how its not a rock but just a bunch of Radahns
Apocalypse From The Sky.
just talk like a dodge like the puppies he kicked, Much good
My dad and my cousin were both trying to finish this game but they struggled so much it’s like you just start but then they make you fight Bosses that can kill you one shot 😂😂😂 I tried, I mean I did well, but then- I just stopped 😂😂
It’s like watching a caveman try to speak English whilst also being cracked at Elden Ring
I like how “a meteor” is just many Radahns.
"Big dragon in..." _Realizes Caelid has an e_ "...Ohio"  This was the best moment for me
Its like hes talking as the messages left on the ground lmao
Crow not trying to say the letter E ends up sounding like the Hulk trying to talk 😂 Meteors were flying down like rain cause of 'the'
Even now i still think that you should beat radahn since he's literally the meteor and killing him would make it stop falling 😆
Funny haha
Why must streamers yell so much
"Old dragon...can't walk....so I kill it!"
i love this because imagine being godrick you just destroyed a tarnished but then you get stuck down by general radahn out of no where
Whole game like this when
He’s talking like the white messages on the ground
This was the video that got me into Elden Ring so long ago. Thank you.
Bro talks in Elden ring messages
Radhn is much more then an asteroid  🤣🤣😂😂🤣🤣😂😂
All of his objectives had the letter E💀
8:01 that wasn`t dog, that was a puppy...............
Here comes the sun
"Defeat the margit mini boss there"  -me right after beating margit after almost 50 tries "oh great THERE IS MORE"
❌Please subscribe the channel!  ✅Sub now. I think
you talk like eldenring-messages
why kick puppy :(
Frankly its not that hard to avoid using a particular part of our vocabulary Although it limits your words, its a good option to train your vocal skills Try it out, it works! Also try using similar words to go out of your comfort to add difficulty.  (Ok that got harder as it went on xd )
why did he even talk
How does this mode work? I don't see any references or comment section about it, well I can make assumptions, but I would like to know for sure  > Also thank you to AbbyBagel for spawning the meteor every time I said the Letter 'E', sitting on the floor for 4 hours while I did this on stream haha   nvm :D
cringe
4:43 "I am skill" Falls off the map
Hey pointcrow I am just starting elden ring and you got bloodhounds fang and it was great and I got it to but when I use it it suks why is that it took 2 days to get can I have help why
Yeah
Brain go brrr
Best video
Man this was vry asy
I love this video LOL
pursued by Radahn
this is like watching a caveman learn how to play eldenring
His gold fish did better than him.
0:44 Yep *opens door* *explodes*
Bro, where did you get this mod
margit is not a mini boss.
4:38 Crow: I am skill... I am skill...  Viewers: Hey Crow, are you ready? *cool music starts to kick in* *Crow walks out of the castle slowly* Crow: Let's go and win this s- Crow: Oh god dam- *gets hit by meteor*
I like how when people do this they sould like cave man
3:46, Why wouldn’t it be, but I love that the meteors are still just Radahn.
the meteor is radahn going second phase
Imagine when heisenberg ask you to say his name
This challenge is boring, just stay mute.
4:39
Bro a meter should have came at the beginning stormveil castle
New challenge: Only speak in Elden ring messages Like "Be wary of ambush" or "If only I had a giant but hole"
How did you put this? This is so good
The puppy guy 😭
YES I DID IT!!... NO NO NO NO NO NO!!! 13:02
Just sound like a child. No! Dogs cool. Halo strung, i am starting da live strung. And today i cannot say a soongy word dat says 'E' or i soomingly oof.
Probably a dumb question. I don’t know much about mods. How do your challenges activate? Is it someone manually keeping track and activating the challenge (here meteor)?
4:47 “I am skill” proceeds to walk of the wall he is on, to his death
Florida.. hovers over Australia
0:24 here comes the sun
I had gotten an ad at 9:25  in the vid, it paused the vid only to show point crow having a pog face on😂
I swear margit was harder than godrick. Didn't feel like a miniboss
9:34
I feel like every sentence he spoke trying not to say E was just an Elden Ring message
“So my goal is to beat the first boss, to get there I have to beat a boss”  - PointCrow
7:49 cleric beast
Where can i download the mod?
Lmao isn't it just radahn falling put of the sku
“Find victory… in skill” -PointCrow
The way he says i am skill and proceeds to fall immediately i can't 😂
Thai is already my favorate vid of his, but now knowing that abby was just sitting out of sight with a lil button. Pressing it every time he said E to make the E teorite appear. Makes this a 1000 times funnier.
Came back to watch this again as I play the DLC. Man, I wasn't on the stream but this is so funny :D
Why didn’t he just parry the meteors
He is talking in message
yard of vision balls
i like how a quarter of this was him trying to kill the dragon without saying a haha that had an e
Radahn on the toilet: Who tf keeps summoning me?
*crow says E* Radahn: how many times do i have to teach you this lesson old man!?
The fact that the metoer is radahn when he comes back from his second phase
what if your fish plays elden ring but every time you say the letter e meteors destroy the world
Instead of "Big hit" he could've said "That's critical" I the hahas. He could've just said "Two guys walk into bar. Both humans got hurt" He's exaurating. Report this channel. Thank you for coming to my Ted talk
and then ?
he started speaking in ER messages
When they asked you how many puppues you kicked. You could have said „minus two“
Here comes the sun-
That ain’t no meteor that’s a man with anger issues and a dying horse
Why doesnt bro just not talk
1:21 the way stares in the camera as he salutes himself for ending the world on purpose just to tell his stream that he has a girlboss is legendary😂
"Thats Florida"
Me it opposite title would be every time I say h and h=hard
He's talking like the notes left by other players 😭
I absolutely laughed my ass off watching this man talk like a caveman.
bros talking in elden ring message language
Godrick is actually the second main boss , not the first
Why does radahn hate the letter E?
E
He literally starts to sound like tbe player messages in Elden Ring after a while while trying to dodge E words 😂
The way his voice rises as he slowly stumbles through his mangled vocabulary makes him sound A LOT like Jerry Lewis.
2:27 dude just summoned his WW II ancestors
Bruh if your goal is to beat a single boss without saying the letter E just don't say anything
i can't believe my favorite creator is really a puppy kicker
i'm dying XD I love the comment "Ohio ? More like let's die yo"
thE
Oh the meteor is Radhan. That's clever.
This guy looks like a creepy pedal

0:43 bro just imagine opening a door, then instantly getting dogged by a random meteorite 😂😂
funny that the meteor is radagon
just say "mod was brought to fruition by orchard of ocular organs"
Can someone explain to me who sees these videos and thinks it'll entertaining content? Are you making videos for 6 year olds?
I would have just changed my language the whole stream😆
Reminds me too much of that one fight from YuYu Hakisho. Two ppl would just chill in a room, required to talk to each other but as time passed, a letter starting from Z to A would be "removed" so that if someone said something that contained the letters, they instantly lost and died. The side character essentially jump scared the shit out of the enemy by screaming "A" behind him, and then pulled a hilarious face at him, causing the enemy to lose by laughing.
4:45 “I am Skill” precedes to jump into the void killing themselves  That got me.
i love how radahn is like hello you just said e
Were is the full run 😭🤣🤣
this was both very funny and very painful. english uses so mnay e's. if only pointcrow was fluent in a language that could use alphabets other than the 26-letter english alphabet.
Ok chat. HE DOESNT WANT TO KICK PUPPIES. NEVER HAS NEVER WILL The torture you had to go through because of a gifted message at the beginning. Chat butchered you for kicking puppies but I know you don’t. Chat just wants to be stupid
Endlessly amused that he could have said ‘i kick no puppy’ and ended the whole debate with no E
What is this game called?
Alternative title: Elden Ring but I sound like a message
Watching this without saying E is equally hard 😂
radahns are orbiting around just waiting for you to say the letter E😭
Margit is not a mini boss. Margit is a full boss. A miniboss are the bosses that you see at the end of random dungeons, like the pumpkin head with the boss healthbar. Margit is a full boss, he has a full moveset that is unique to him (and Morgot) and is required for story progression (if you want to do all remembrances). Godrick is a remembrance boss.
The chat was amazing ❤
I MUST FIND FIGHT STICK 😂😂😂
immediately complete the reverse exclusively have E (only have words that contain the letter E)
I just stared the game so dont get mad at me but, you call Margit a mini boss!? He is way more than mini boss. Godrick and Margit are both bosses, not a mini boss and a boss.
Do part 2
Great video!
"Here comes the sun..."
14 all of the goals have e
I like the implication that Radahn is just in the sky watching Pointcrow like a hawk
Please play lies of p. The best game there is
Now do the rest of the game
What mod is it?
I have family in ohio and I can confirm that Ohio is exactly like caelid.
It’s funny knowing the meteor is just radahn
"E terite" 🤣
Say e or Radian
You should have binded your e button
This becomes infinitely funnier after he says a word with the letter E and then the meteor just hits like a semitruck
just dont talk
lore accurate Radahn
Why e
0:45 “Let’s look outside and see the wonderful world!”  Opens to a meteor
it's just magical how he gradually loses his ability to speak and becomes a caveman
I love how he develops the ability to not die in exchange for losing the ability to formulate sentences correctly
How your vids go from 4m views this vid to 500k the next vid is crazy
Help 9:13
How is something like this even created?
9:31 just funny
I missed it! Dies
Stop with the fucking Ohio memes it’s stupid
find victory in skill. i AM skill! *procedes to die*  yep. thats pointcrow for you
Every time a meteor drops, a new Elden Ring is created.
Not if Fenrir and Jormungandr eat the world first!
You kick puppy I kick you
Calling Caelid Ohio is quite accurate, to be honest.
hi! i love your content! can you make  a video where you do this challenge but for the whole game and add the heart rate too? maybe a mod for twitch to summon npcs? that would be amazing
imagining saying "the first boss" instead of "godrick"
"Ohio sucks, man!" <- This is what I got out of all this.
"YOU SHALL NOT PASS!"  "I can say that! :D"
Big boi in ohio XD
i dont know why but it pisses me off when he says that margit is a miniboss and that godrick is the first boss. the first required to progress story boss is margit and hes harder than godrick anyways. idk i just wish he said first runebearer or smth idk
"why waste time say lot word when few word do trick" - Kevin Malone  That video reminds me of this office episode haha
EEEEEEEEEEEE
Calling Caelid Ohio is funny af 😂
Margit said you have no ladies...    Lay deez foolish ambitions to rest
Ohiogazamazues
Reminds me of a scene in Gilmore girls where a group of them are speaking with E's and I know it's acting, but they still speak so eloquently haha.
Honstly, I lov this challng. Whil it might not b original, it rally is an amazing vido, on of th bst on this channl, I will dfinitly subcrib
You take people that have nowhere else to go, and when they do have somewhere else to go, you don’t want them to. You’re sick and cultish.
The most easy thing to do is not to talk.
11:01 the moment he knew he f upped
I can't believe this is how I learned PointCrow kicks puppies
Much ungabunga lol
“It kill him, VICTORY”
Please tell me there is a vod for this somewhere 😂
the last part was literally ''YES YES YES" .... "NO NO NOOOO"
Nut
PointCrow: i AM skill! *falls off and dies* Me: yes, Crow. you ARE skill. Skill Issue!
There’s no way that talking like this for prolonged periods of time doesn’t do some sort of lasting damage to your brain
E
He said English English😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I never laughed so damn hard watching a Elden Ring video in my life bro lmao
they should make the bosses immune to the meteors
It’s like trying to watch ai make a stream
I disliked cuz u hit the turtle
I AM A SURGEON!
My brain was melting as much as him trying to understand what he was trying to say
Why are you making fun of Ohio?😢 I live there.
You see that entire time he could’ve said “I don’t kick pups” meaning he indeed does kick puppies
Literally makes you talk like an Elden Ring player message. "Kill, unholy bird"
margit miniboss???
“you just said E. dumbass.”
Wait what. MARGIT WAS A MINI BOSS?!?!
‘Find victory in skill. I am skill’ got a new motto
How bout don't talk. Christ.
This wall funny af
at 4:15 it's true, you can't say zero or one, but you could've said "null"
This is much haha vid, i joy lots. You good video man-wait no SHI- *explosion*
the......
You suck at not saying that damn thing. But you kick a puppy.
you sound like the messages players leave behind
doug looks... different... without a beard.
3:45 "Mabye I can dodge it"  Famous last words
"I am skill"  dies
What a horrific condition to play with ( didn't say it )
E
Stop saying “the!” Please my cheeks hurt from all the laughing and smiling I’ve been doing from watching this video!! 🤣🤣🤣
this is a ... funny ... twitch thing that was ... a long ... recording ... and was ... cut down.
8:40 I disagree weeping is Britain, due to the amount of rain.
Whenever I see the subtitles I know something bout to happen :D
for anyone who has played the game that is not a meteorite that is radhans special attack
He is skill
can this be a series for each of the bosses?
Easy...
"I am skill" Falls to his final bit of living on our void rock humorously, producing a large laugh from my lungs.
9:26 His face i’m dying😂
E
The funniest thing is the puppy kicking
No never say no never say a word with E at the end of the video nooooooooooo!
"I am skill" *falls off building to his death*
“ AHHHH Bird Bird in church BIRD IN CHURCH! UNHOLY! kill. KILL UNHOLY. Unholy bird now has holes. Wait- oh my god “ has GOT to be my favourite part of this whole video 😭
9:34 I MISSED IT proceeds to get destroyed
I just realized that the comet is rahdan
Nothing is as funny as him constantly saying it without thinking
Every time I say the letter e radahn turns into a meteor and kills me
E
You could have sayed "thy" instead of "the",its the same but with "y".
spoiler alert he couldn't dodge it
Rare footage of Point Crow acting autistic.
how the game recognise the letter??? :O
NO NO NO NO
He could've just said  "I dont kick any pups" and he would've probably stopped it
I like the idea that radahn is just in the dunes wandering but whenever he hears a tarnished say the letter ‘e’ his spider senses start tingling and he immediately goes to meteor them
5:25 PointCrow kicks puppies confirmed
pointcrow heres a solution to the puppy kicking problem "i dont kick young dogs why would i do that?" boom, no meteor
Radahn had enough just sitting around now......he hunts fresher meat
Can u do the same meteor but u gotta beat game
5 radahn’s damn 7:29
Radahn for the W
0:45 He open the door of death
Radahn don’t fuck wit the letter E😂
Multiple radahns?   W video
A moment of respect for all the puppies he kicked in(for) this video :(
It's weird because there were multiple times where he said words with "e" that didn't count. Unless I'm just being tired from my lack of sleep watching this, maybe he got away with it a few times. Or maybe there were exceptions to the rules? I don't know, I'm tired and this is just funny. 4:44 for example.
8:00
This is the worst video ever. Not enough e’s
I’m still unconvinced that Erick doesn’t kick puppies
... does PointCrow not realise that he can say the word "critical", or does he just like saying "big hit"?
Is no one gonna mention how he called Margit a mini boss 😮😮
he sounds like a toddler the longer the video goes in
I just realized that the meteor was that one rahdahn attack
If you didn't now this is actually Radhan Meteor so you can dodge it 😅
You could have said the Short form for Puppy (Pup with other word with Pups being Plural
I saw the goldfish video before this one. Tortellini kicked your butt in this game 😂
Why not just parry the meteor!?!
Almost every time it’s the same word “the”
Bro this is such a homestuck reference
4:45 is the part of the vid that made me laugh the most 😭
Tortellini is somehow and someway better than u at this speed run
3:27 my guy is dying from laughter
Now do that while playing sekiro
10… months? 10 months? 10 MONTHS? TEN MONTHS!?!?!?!?! 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
your goldfish is better at the game
thinking about how a guy at 4:48 said all odd numbers have E. and hes actually right...
I spoiled parts of Eldren Ring for myself by watching and I DO NOT care. It was worth it.
Just don't talk😊
I love how quickly Eric realises he can just say "Godrick", then immediately proceeds to refer to him as "The First Boss" for the rest of the video and dies to the meteor every time.
The editing is superb
meteor is actually radanh
"I'm in Ohio. Ohio is scary."  yes.
"I do not kick puppy. I do not kick dogs. You moron"
This is stupid hes saying things on purpose
he HATES puppies
Great video until the Ohio meme. Such stupid braindead bullshit.
npc
Beat the entire game like this
Dude this is awesome. Haven't laughed so much in a while. Thank you
Puppies = small/young dogs
bro had to talk like a wise old monk to survive
Now do it without saying the least used letter.
Radahnteor
if i say thE lEttEr E mEtEors dEstroy thE world
Making content out of nothing.  Pretending to say "E" accidentally. You can just sit silent...
You should do a run with every word you say starts and ends with 🅱️, has four letters and contains at least two 🅾️
When she said "I am Malnia, Blad of Miqulla." i felt that.
My ohioan brothers and sisters as well as others we have gotten a person to come to our state
playing without saying a word is a solution too. (no E said in this phrase btw)
Conjunctions are so hard to avoid
As somon who livs in Florida, Florida is a indd giant castl.
I'm a bit late, but did he just call Margit a mini boss...
Is the meteor "I-frameable"?
6:00  Eric: YOU SHALL NOT PASS Also Eric but in a happy baby voice: I can say that!
"I go now to...Ohio" damn near made me fall out of my chair laughing
I like to imagine this is what would happen to us at the beginning of the game if Radahn's mind wasn't Scarlet Rot soup.
It's not a meteor it's just lore accurate Radahn
Want full vid no ltr e
Does anyone know how does he program this to the Game?
Monkey wants banana, Monkey angry.
"I'll kick any puppy  there is" -PointCrow- puppy kicker
fun fact the so called meteor is actually a ability from a boss called radahn
He definitely does kick puppies
We don't deserve Abby for monitoring Eric for every instance of the letter 'e' just so she can murder him for our entertainment.
This is why Radahn holds back the stars
1:46 You said are which contains e meaning you don’t kick puppies
The he kicks multiple puppies line was hilarious.
he is talking the messages language
0:46 Feels like something out of a skit, with the character opening the door only for the world to instantly get destroyed.
the fact eric didn't use bleed to kill the dragon pisses me off
radahn waiting patiently in the sky for eric to say E
not like you cant dodge through the meteorite or something
comedic timing at its finest
I love how you can see radahn inside the meteor oh fuck i said e ….
8:22 Love the mix of disappointment and confusion as fiery hell rains down
“Margit miniboss”
eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
radahn gaming
Power word KILL
Bros speaking in caveman💀💀
"Hehehehe"
Why did a meteor not summon when you said like and subscribe?
Couldve said nada at 4:00
kick puppies
Bro was speaking like the elden ring chat messages 💀
*tortoise walks by*  "DÖEG!"
E for elden ring?
E
Fun fact: the menteor is radahn
The end of the world has been brought to you by the letter E.
I am convinced DougDoug and PointCrow share a chat community with how similar they act.
e
Garden of Ocular Organ
6:51   hahaha im high ashell
yEs
I imagine this is how the dinosaurs were wiped out
Crow's  the Worst enemy THE
“Puppy”   Eric: 😳 Also Eric: Bloodhounds Fang…
Someone should’ve made him sing Shinunoga E-Wa if he knows that song
Thas the problem have one article XD
bro is talking in dark souls messages
"Margit mini-boss" he's not a mini-boss don't make the newbies feel bad
E
"I am skill" -Pointcrow 2022 also pointcrow 2022: Dies imediately after saying that
Next level of vine boom
"big boy dragon in Ohio" i fucking died 💀💀💀
Him opening the door to see a meteor going his direction is so funny
"now, to ricky" after margit is excellent
This looks hilarious. Where is the full vod?
I am skill 😂😂😂😂
You could’ve said nil when they asked you Houma many puppies you’ve kicked at a time
Wish a bot did it so it could be like:  PointCrow: This game is fun. Bot: You said a word with e in it. Activating Meteor.
Bro really called Margit a miniboss?
pcrow caght in 4k in "1:51"
I like how he called caelid Ohio bc that is how I felt when I went there
I am so confused why saying words with the letter E causes a meteor to strike the world. How does the game know you said the Letter E?
"I *am* skill." dies immediately
“Flasks, M” - PointCrow 2022
Why not just stop speaking
I like how during the blood hound fight, when he survived the meteor you can see Radahn spawn out of it.
6:00  6:05
"I'm going to beat Elden Ring without saying E."  *doesn't talk*
streamers trying not to talk every second clearly knowing any word with specific letter can trigger the end of the world
Now beat Renalla or Radahn like this
i deeply love his genuine "what's up..with air bus food? :D" its amazing
this whole challenge is just "why use many word when few word do trick"
you sound like the dude from the "i am a surgeon" meme
1:20 I had an ad right as the E teorite commit impact. It was basically a tbc meme from the olden days.
A perfect ending really
You could’ve said da instead of the
“How many puppies do u kick?” Crow: “2”
PUPPY KICKER
IF he was smart, he would get the Opaline Bubbletear and abuse the meteor.
This is a good thing. (It's really hard to form sentences without using E, especially for a non-native English speaker)
Alt title:Guy playing Elden ring without saying without saying the 5th letter of the alphabet while at the same time a couple of guys go insane about how he kicks puppies
1:55 "I don't kick puppiEs" where's that meteor?
E
E = Death
Watching him reprogram his own speech pattern. Soon he’ll be talking like this in public from ptsd
[4:06] To say "zero", you have to say "half of half of two round down".
Say Da instead of The😂
Just dont talk
"I am skill" _Immediately walks off a cliff and dies._
9:33 bro the face
Pointcrow kicks puppies confirmed
Don't say anything
just saw that its multiple radahns lol
How does it work
He didn’t know the exploit
Power move: while playing along, just switch to other languages where the word doesn't contain the letter E.
9:30 “I missed it” 😂😂😂
Man, I absolutely love point crow videos
hearing crow saying "IT KILL HIM! VICTORY!" in caveman is the funiest thing i heard all day.
most mentally advanced souls player
I must admit, at first I did not think that this task would actually stop his rounds much but I quickly saw just how wrong I was. It was shocking how commonly this man said a word containing a symbol which his mouth could not say. Counting how much PointCrow did fail is difficult but as a smart man has probably said, “fuck that”.
If you are skill, then i am triple skill
Just stop talking
Instead of 'the' say 'thy'
When he dies  we have haha’s right chat
And punches them*
Guys he doesn’t kick puppy’s he KO’s them in smash bros😂
11:00 this mans progress got deleted faster that most peoples twitter account lol
This entire vid is just Eric returning to monke
imagine killing a samurai and he says "need" and right afterwards the entire world burns to a crisp
This has got to be one of my favorite videos. I think you handled it well man 😂good content and sorry for your suffering lmao.
Yo.. the ending song kinda slaps
"I AM SKILL"  -PointCrow *immediately dies after*  -PointCrow
i dont remember greyoll heaving feathers
Imagine, a naked chrackhead enters your arena, and utters only "E" and wipes out your entire place
"Yes yes I did it" then died
"I Am skill" then died
just do a blood spit thing that has big hurt
I love how when the white text appears you know Eric's about to say a word with E
Stop 🛑 bullying Ohio
E
I don’t kick copious amounts of pups
Kill unholy😂😂
Did you just call Margit a mini boss you will be hearing from my lawyers
Well this is clickbait. The challenge isn't to not just day the letter e but also any word with e in it
when he avoided the meteor just to say missed and get blown up
Is that the guy from fortnite
Let’s all agree, Eric doesn’t kick puppies.
This is hilarious. You sound like you're having a stroke 🤣 also, "Ohio" 🤣🤣
this video is an instant cure for depression-at least for sadistic creeps like me :)
Nice video, kinda want a real life version
can't believe Eric kicks puppies
The first word he says in the video starts with an e lol
"IT. KILL. HIM." 😂😂
What a femboy lookin mf... tf
its like watching a downsyndrome guy faking normal beating elden ring
How to win any fight: 1 go up to the enemy 2 EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
You sound like Ayla from Chronotrigger! OMG this had me laughing so much X)
PointCrow has been watching DougDoug. Lol.
CaElid, aka Badlands, aka Mushroom Kingdom, aka Rot Pit.  Any others?
The easiest way to do it is not talk
Gold sour fowl foot, nom on foot to…obtain 100 k souls from big old bastard. Put I into its Will I do for much cash
Reads Gadsby Once
Realizing how I’m from New York and we have slang to how we talk making this challenge a breeze
Fight stick
E
next time try to get Raptor of the mists to try and iframe parry the meteor
PointCrow: *[E]* xists  Radahn and his forty million clon *[E]* s: *_IT’S OUR TIM [E] TO SHIN [E], BOIS!!_*      (Edit) Just imagine if _anyon _*_[E]_* saying *[E]* spawn *[E]* d a m *[E]* t *[E]* or…
7:47
I wish the video didn't skip around so much, I wanna see every second between him saying E and him exploding from the meteor. It's the calm before the storm that really destroys the world.
margit is not a mini boss hes a boss
Sephiroth is really messing you over when huh.
Why not just stop talking
Whos summoning these tho?
Gotz to go think lik da orcz brudaz and not lik puny man things. Daz how you win.
"I'm going to beat the first boss without saying the letter E"  The silent Es in are, have, use, house, hole, damage, done, more, missed: "Are you sure about that?"
He should try to do the challenge of not saying the letter A
Did he just say: margit MINI boss!!!
ohio
Alternate title: Radahn hates the letter E.
that was an amazing ending
New Botw update looks sick.
Big boy Dragon in Ohio has lots of souls
the most entertain video i've watched for past 2 month tbh xD
1:00 "I should find a good fight stick." - Computer 2023 (LOL because PointCrow = PC = Computer)
the people in the chat LOL
Pointcrow has officially learned caveman language
Band kid humor
I laught 400bilion times
Is Bloodhound's Fang a play on the band Bloodhound's Gang maybe?!
calling Margit a mini-boss is a crazy flex
I also don’t kick puppiEs ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh boom 🤯 do not say E ahhhhhhhhhh  boom 🪦🪦🪦
"This is so asy"
Only in ohio cuz he said ohio
Cheater and liar
Kind of sounds like Morty from Rick and Morty haha
i need this mod 💀
This is peak content
i live in FL
'I am skill' *proceeds to fall to his death -PointCrow
Is this the guy that kicks toast balls
Having a speech disorder be like:
we'll remember you as the best pro puppy kicker alive.
he's speaking in  Fromsoft floor messages
cant wait for the real life one
This video was a funny haha, good haha.
Defends that he doesn't kick puppies, calls a tortoise a dog and stabs it. 🤷🏽‍♂️
8:20 is the absulutly best moment
I need a full playthrough
It’s so bad acting
To me, a native Russian-speaker, this challange looks so easy. Not to use any auxiliary words like have, the, are - easy, we don't have them. When I first learned English, that's exactly how it sounded.
Stop kicking puppies
eric, can you tell me a good haha?
he did kick the puppies i saw him
Hiroshima 1:21
DougDoug es mejor
Mor popl nd to s this. That's pak contnt right thr! LOL
Look mom, I'm on a cool guy's short vod
How my English teacher thinks I speak.
6:04
I literally have this game
If PointCrow truely wasn't evil, he would've said, "I don't kick baby dogs." Guess he really does kick puppies twice while calling them bad boys 😢
You should do this in botw
Now try the Letter N
This video is incredible 🤣🤣
JUst dont talk...
Radahn caught so many Ws
Perfect timing 0:45
I could not survive this, I’m so bad at knowing what letters are in a word I might say
This looks hard 😅
Morty voic actor?
PointCrow: This is the start Narrator: Of the end
I cant beliv Pointcrow would just kick so many puppis.
what English level A2 sounds like
u can fell him going back to monkey
2:56 really?
How the games detect when he says e ?
3:36 what going on with your eyebrow? Lol
How does this work How does the game know?
it's so easy dude Just speak like Elden ring boss!  I love thou play
The imagery of him slowly opening the door while the E teorite can be seen approaching from outside at the beginning of the video at 0:44 is just incredible
He should read that one book that doesn’t use any E’s as his only dialogue for the stream
streamer iq
So what I have learnt from this video is that Eric likes to kick puppies but not a single puppy
`sounds like hes talking in the way people write  the mesages on the ground
Down is down you really need directions
Radahn is just chucking these rocks at you
E
Why is he so stupid?
Challenge: Describe my most recent D&D character without using any words with the letter E  Alythana Hanali is an adult girl humanoid with pointy audio organs. Alythana is a bard, with a subclass focusing on knowing lots of stuff about things. Alythana finds joy in playing a music-making thing that was a gift from mom. Guards took Alythana's mom away to a prison colony for unlawfully taking food from a shop. A humanoid with many forms took Alythana's big bro Aramil out of living world and took on his identity. Alythana's dad was making not much coin, so Alythana and siblings all got malnutrition growing up. Alythana's big sis Vadania got a job on a ship from a country that was at war with familiar country, Alythana join in to find opportunity, to track down Aramil's assassin, and to find mom. Alythana's husband is a dwarf, Oskar, that also was on that ship, who gifts a fancy sword during his proposal to marry, Alythana saw no point in owning rings and similar things. Alythana got a baron to assist in finding mom's location, baron's son was a POW that was put on exact colony as Alythana's mom. Alythana's sis, husband, and ship buds got Alythana snuck aboard a ship bound for prison colony.  Though it was long and arduous, Alythana and party found both mom and baron's son, and all got dark monstrosity out of living world. Hasn't found Aramil's assassin, but will try to track that individual down soon.
OMG A BOSS say: E boss is ded
testing the limits of your vocab i see
Just dont talk of mute yourself
**doesnt talk tha antira straam** “I am skill” **falls** “I need, *kaboom noise* “ U kill what first? The kaboom?
Georges Perec: wrote "La disparition", a 300-page novel that does not include the letter E once.  PointCrow: cannot say more than 5 words in a row without the letter e.
Let's make a video and deliberately use the letter e everytime I get in a boss fight
Oh i love that finish. I was shook in anticipation, hoping you'd shout bad confirmation past winning. XD
Just the realization gets me 😂
The second I noticed the meteor is Radahn I burst out laughing
IT NEVER GETS OLD
Everyone ask where is down but no one else how is down
*refers to japanised english*
You know, it's not that hard to construct a pair of words without using most common symbol in Anglicus syllabary
Pointcrow is my favourite incompetent streamer, just like me frfr
No tricks here😆 gotta love donation messages
Bro spoke soundboard
homestuck
Legend has it crow has PTSD from the letter E after this
The idiots who said “yOu sAiD bOsSeS” should really check their ears
I cannot fully track this prohibition's difficulty, as any individual should surpass this kind of world finishing crap by simply not talking at all.
It's like a light novel title
Well these challenges have sure escalated, huh?  Also finally something to make me even the slightest bit interested in Elden Ring!
I am skill *Walks off*
I enjoy how, the more annoyed with certain areas he got, the more he sounded like Gilbert Gottfried.
What location of part 2?
He sounds like the messages you see where the grammar is fucked lmao
I not saw your stuff, but I laugh so much! I follow for all incoming laughs. Thanks for fun in my brain.  Not using E is a lot harder than I thought! But really that was hilarious!
"I am skill" 4:48 *Proceeds to fall into the abyss*
Everyone talking about "I am skill", and no one noticed the absolute banger of a Chinese proverb: "Find victory in skill".
How many times does he have to say "the" before he realizes there's an "e" in there... On that note, a smart person would use that meteor to their advantage and just say E on purpose to one-shot bosses.
"We don't need no stinkin e" - Homer Simpson.
I don’t get how this works. What’s actually triggering the meteor falling?
Caveman... AWOO!!
E
Cav- much much Old man sp- talking simulator
bro, becomed adolf hitler 💀 in 2:26
E
puppy kicker
3:10 why doesn't he get punished here, he says killed?
every phrase he concocted that didn't sound paleolithic felt like such a W
How to make a person use all of their brain and none of their brain at the same damn time.
Fastest- Quickest- GODRICK KILL
Just speak medieval. Say thou art and stuff
Awesome vid
what is ending music?
you could of said thy instead of the
1:38 Caveman has e.
Calling Caelid as "Ohio" just made my day
Pointcrow: "I missed i- *meteor falls on him* Dang it"
Radahn really hates this letter
he turns into a caveman towards the end
Should have used some Old English "thou"s to make Englishing EasiEr.
He speak like cave man
Bro, hit them with the critical and I ain’t talking about moist 12:19
It is funny how PointCrow can say things similar to "I want to kill Godrick" without using a syllabary's fifth unit. Oddly, Pointcrow didn't.
Ohio? More like oh hi yo!
Can we have a "the" counter
PointCrow: E.  Radahn: How many times do I have to teach you a lesson, young man???
E
Nil = Zero for puppies kicked
Thankful my only talent isn’t being annoying and playing video games.
bro really called margit a "miniboss" that prolly triggered so many people LOL
if you see subtitles just get ready to see the world fall.
just dont talk.... and you can roll to dodge the attack
why say lot word when few word do trick
1:21 Thou art still Maidenless.
I… am skill.. *proceeds to fall off a building*
He should have used the opaline bubble tear in boss battles to kill them easily
but what if the  meteors were Radahn meteors?
I don't speak english and this is what I do whenever I have to speak english irl
Elden Ring: Majora's Mask
This was so freaking funny to watch
``IT   KIL    HIM  VICTORY``
The video gives me Yi lon ma vibes
"Strat now is boss soon. Kill thing not boss so i skill up".  Personally, i tend to spell "grind" without any Es... 😀
Bro when chat mentioned the dragon in Caelid, I was kinda playing along in my head and said Ohio as well. Memes have ruined me
"STRAT NO WORK" "BIG ROCK NO KILL"
He sounds like the elden ring messages 😭
My boy is an elden ring message
honnestly im surprised noone asked "which console do you prefere wii or wii u?" for the sound of "e"
I Love the E MEteor Mod :D (See Only Mode by Me)
Mayhap it brought by thou faculty of this vocabulary, but this ain’t hard lookin at all.
Day good now, was sad, watch and was now laugh and happy    thE
7:13 had me dying
I subscribed after "I am skill"
He goes full on kamikaze on these bosses that I feel bad
Personally, I think he should’ve deleted the save file and start over every time he used the letter E
Instead of the say thy
This makes the bosses infinitely easier. Just spam e
Radahns revenge.
bruh, pointcrow is talking without a basic part of US vocabulary. That's crazy!  and so am I.  >:)
It’s not even a meteor radahn is just on standby to do some gaming
i love how every noob in the chat spams the word he said with E in it LOL
0:44 the timing of when he opened the doors LMAOOOOO
4:38 Pointcrow "Being Skill"
Pontcrow kicks puppies
F for the puppies
This comment's gonna be a mouthful so let me take a mo- *inhales*   E
Since the meteor is radahn.... I guess hE's fEd up with thE lEttEr E
I like the Idea of Radahn hearing the letter e, and being like I’ve been summoned, flies across the map and just boom
MaRgIt MiNi BoSs guess I got my ass kicked by a mini boss
How did he do this though
THIS is where the name Ohio for caelid comes from
Through pog amogus big chungus sus
GUys THiS is AsY
He's very quickly becoming a master of Haiku with this idea.
08:00 There he goes kicking puppies again
eric kicks puppies confirmed
maybe next time instead of saying the you can say thy, like what people in medieval times used to say.
"bird in church" is my new favorite line
E Edit: Why did you kill Greyoll? She is not your enemy, and there are so many better ways to farm runes.
IS THAT RADANN!
I wonder if he could've used the opaline bubbletear to tank the damage and farm a bunch of runes
“The mini Boss Margit” bruh I thought he was the main boss of limgrave
''i missed it''
margit isnt a mini boss its a main boss
Me when thE
U kick puppies 🐶 4:08
Why is this so funny
so many moments that got me thinking of the punisher meme Wait wait wait, no no no no!
Could you just use other languages to get around this challenge. Just use a word from another language without e. Example, “por favor” for please, and “sí” for yes
Radaan hates E
I love that were calling Caelid Ohio. It makes sense
I love how the meteor is just Radahn. Tactical nuke moment
This man just couldn't resist using the hard "E" smh
Margit isnt a miniboss
This man: havE   Radahan: REEEEEEEE
POV: rock dont hurt 😔 6:42
Do you play The Last Guardian? If so, could you do a playthrough like this, but an armored knight spawns?
PointCrow, did you enjoy (boom) this mod more (boom), or did you find... Artifacts of... Past... funner (boom)?* (Deactivates meteor mod) PointCrow, which did you find more challenging, Elden Ring with meteors, or Relics of the Past? *Translation: Did you find Elden Ring more fun, or did you find Relics of the Past more fun?
I want moooore
I personally, would have screamed E at the top of my lungs, just to prove that I, infact, do *NOT* kick puppies.
Margot is not a mini boss. He is a full fledged boss. He has a cutscene. Margot is the first boss of elden ring.
"I missed it" *fucking explodes* 9:31
bird in church  bird in church  UNHOLY
E
This would be soo cheesy for most of the game, animation of getting on and off your horse gives you invincibility so u could cheese though alot of the game lol
It sounds like he's speaking in Dark Souls messages lmao
Beat the game with meteorite lol I would be die 😂 laughing.
Beat the game like this
how does it distinguishes between "This" and "These"
Pain at the end 🤣
Bro just say I do not kick puppies instead of I d9 not kick a puppy
The way he has to talk for this challenge is like an AI trying to philosophize
I lost it at the sad "Big rock no kill!", I love your content haha
Bros talking like player messages in this game
“I am skill” Immediately dies
*E*
Can we just talk about how the  meteor is just radhan in his second phase transition
This man is talking in Orange Soapstone
It should be 0 grave stone run aswell to make him a true Cave man! aka Puppies kicker!
So wen can expect a real life version
Lol this is funny haha 🤣
I go now to Ohio to get dragon souls is the sentence that made the most sense in that video
I am skill- Pointcrow 2022
George Perec vibes
Cheater and a liar
At 5:30 he says take and doesn’t die
I like how Crow just reverts to 'caveman' instead of actually using more natural words that don't have the letter, like 'I'm going to Ohio' or 'kill Godric quickly'
Somebody tell me how much times he said E!
this challenge looks fun and i wouldnt mind running such a challenge myself just to prove i can say the letter e all i want and still not be killed by meteors xD
Can we all appreciate that the meteorite is radhan just punishing crow for saying e
Am I the only one who wants a full run with someone using the bubbletear to tank the meteor and rain death on every boss
4:39 - 4:50 is the best part of the video.
4:38 "I'm am skill" proceeds to walk off a cliff
I don't care about the game, I don't even know what it is, I'm just crying over every *E*xplosion.
Fun fact fellows, Greyoll is the mother of all of the dragons in the Dragonbarrow. She's quite old, but that's not the reason she can't move; She can't move because she's particularly affected by the Scarlet Rot sickness.   In fact, it's kinder of you to kill her and put her out of her misery rather than let the rot eat away all of her flesh and eventually reach her brain or vital organs, which would take *very* many years.  The *truly* cruel thing to do would be to kill her, rest at the grace before she fully fades away, kill her again, rinse and repeat. Which you can do. It's a known exploit.  Also yay, I've been watching Eric for 3 days and already feel like I've been here for a hundred! I didn't know he also made Zelda content when I first watched this video, nor did I know he made Pokemon content. I'm here to stay for both and I patiently await his next Elden Ring video.
Nonononono! At the end 😂😂😂 We want a continuation of this please!!!
It funny how the meteor is Radon
*E*
1:52 ey can somebody clip that?
I just found this guy and i was thinking about subscribing but Turns out he kicks puppies so i will skip i think on that sub.
Ah yes, bloodhounds fang. Aka the tooth of puppies you kick!
me say funny ha ha  ( Meteor incoming )
11:44 That alone is a top tier comedy.
I can't believe it took this long for an actually interesting challenge run to be recommended to me  This is DougDoug levels of absurdity and I love it, I think it meshes excellently with a Fromsoft game
"Now i run to location of boss" That cracked me up so bad, the most caveman phrase i've ever heard, and i am a caveman myself  Got ahead of myself, this whole video made me cry!  "Big boy dragon in Ohio"  Man i'm so dead!
This message is brought to you by the official E counter who has nothing better to do  Number of lethal E's: *45*
The only game where Margit could be a mini-boss 💀
9:34 I missed it! *explodes*
If i was him I wouldn’t talk at all😂
The meteor is like 7 radahns lol
Garden of eyes could be said without e as farm of optics
So just dont talk ?
He is yoda
Proceeds to torture himself. Also E.
Now do it in ral lif
0:45 The shot of him opening the door into a massive explosion is gold lmao
Elden Ring but Radahn realizes there's nothing stopping him from leaving caelid when he can literally fly
He sounds like the doge memes from 2016
THIS MESSAGE IS FOR PUPPIES, E.
4:43 I about DIED laughing myself 6:11 - the editing of this entire video really shines omg ohhhh that ending is just so cruel poor man xD
I'd say to see him continue this challange all the way to elden beast.
5:05 B I R D  I N  C H U R C H
This whole video is just Radahn getting mad at the player for saying E lmao
E for meteorite
the
he sounds like a toddler 🤣
wait, is this like speech recognition?
There's a French novel that is written without using the letter E a single time (it is also the most common letter in French). The writer called it "the disappearance".
just shut up
Wait is the meteor radhain
bro talking in Elden Ring message system 💀💀💀
This made my brain fart somehow, but amazing video!!!
I already lost it when he said "This is the start"
>Walk into boss room “diE.” >boss and you both die >we take those
He should of used morning star, morning star is great against dragons with bleeding
YouTube in 2030 when every thing is censored
I should find a good fight stick!
PointCrow: Says E. Radhan: So you have chosen death.
Sounded like my autistic cousin all video
Eeeeeeseeee
Bro tryna be dougdoug
His talking is just like elden ring messages.
E
I found your vid funny.  Many laughs.  If I play with this mod, would stop living many much.  You play good.
from ohio, can confirm it's just a colder cealid
You know you can say like I nad to got a rally big stick to fight with (you will probably need to read this a few times
I missed it… boooommm !!!
0:44 Opening the door to the meteor was probably one of the best timed moments ever
Alas you possess not any virgins.
The fact the meteor is just a large enemy falling from the sky is pretty funny to me
He sounds like he's talking in Elden Ring ground messages
Did he just call Margit a mini boss?
Finally an accurate representation of what Ohio actually looks like
Radahn worked really hard for this video lmao
elden ring instakill strat
0:45 crow just casually opens the door to a meteor
Alternative title: talking like a caveman for 13 minutes
This is reaallly epic elden Ring video😎
Just don't talk, focus on the game.
2:11 Subscribe has an E man
I am skill-dies
This guy is not that smart. Subbed. :)
Canonic lore of how the dinos died
How does the games nmknow when you say an E word? And who controls the meteor?
Vow of the indomitable would be so op
4:39 my guy is writing shakespere
"foul.... guy" 💀💀
Not saying the n word would be way to hard for me
he basically just started speaking in player messages  therefore  try finger, but hole
1:05 6:50 7:49
Just realized that the meteorite is  Actually ten or six radans
I thought it was funny when he died after saying that he was skill😂😂
You could have just said it like (i dont kick plural word of puppy)
thE will haunt you now
Radahn in the clouds with a spyglass, waiting for the time to strike as he reads your lips
I leve it how when he does these types of streams he ether dies or talks in caveman
I love that Poitcrow started playing elden ring
I do enjoy listening to google translate PointCrow
Instead of the say thy
Pov you pissed off Radahn
Hey point crow next time you do a challenge like this can you do Elden ring but you can’t say E in you have to get from the start of the final boss
You said scare-E dog
Bro he started the video with saying e
69K
u dieing to the meteor after the bird is the birds way of saying F*** you
"it killEd him" He bypassed it one time
This must be how Ernest Vincent Wright felt as he was writing Gadsby.
Lmao what program is that? 😂
I'm so sorry that I laughing at this moment- *meteor* oh..
There is an amazing way to complete this. Extremely difficult... It's called not talking ;)
Just don’t talk?
Loving the slow degradation of human speech as the video goes on.
4:39 “find victory in skill, i am skill” *falls off the edge* What a quote
Fun fact:meter is radhan
0:44 Its spelled Yup not Yep "who df does yep"
My man‘s speaking in the language of other player messages
Man Radahn has had it with these streamers
mod it so you cant cheese the bosses and do part 2
Next we need the whole game
I hate to tell you this but Margot is classified as a main story bosd
He could have just spoken in old English since there’s not many e’s in it
He secondly kicks pupies
I can’t escape Ludwig’s stupid ass laugh…I know he stole it from QT and I don’t mind hers but Ludwig’s version of her laugh is so fucking annoying, and this man straight up copy pasted it. FUCK he even does the same stupid face Ludwig does, I’m dying of cringe
EEE
Wouldn't it be better not to talk😂
ok but if pointcrow plays more fromsoft games my depression will disappear
Yeojun
Yeojun
This made me laugh way more than it should have :D
4:13 could've said nil my guy.
Hi
How did you even program that 😂
"I am skill" has to be the 2nd best final words, right behind "hold my beer".
The number of times he could have just said "E" to the puppy kicking accusation he died anyway by missing up what a shame. I guess he just likes kicking puppies to much to deny the claim.
I am skill
This was so stressed and hilarious at the same time
PointCrow: E Me: You've met with a terrible fate, haven't you?
This is probably the best material to use to fake someones voice
Right after he killed Margot it didn't meteor when he said killed
This is so funny. You have the best personality to do this challenge. Hearing you talk like a caveman is so funny lol.
4:43 "I am skill" Literally immediately dies
you could have just said "i dont kill dogs"😭
Just don't speak lol
Why didn't you scream e and dogded out of the way of the meteor??
bro just needs to parry better
Mini boss? Margot took me like 100 hours to finally kill him
Nice of them to make a mod that emulates the experience of dying in the Battle of Belhalla from Fire Emblem 4.
Can you make a voice mod like this for any game? If so I would love to play either In Sound Mind or Alien Isolation like this XD
how does this work, do the mods spawn the meteorite, is there voice recognition
It hears like if you were speaking German 2:28
Damn I wish he ended the battle with a reverb’d ‘E’
Good film. Old Ring look fun good day to you.
Salutations guys, PointCrow this is. Do  you on occasion incur picking-up-things fright in gigantic do-what-you-want RPGs?
9:43 Ever Realize he could've just gotten the bleed weapon in the carriage at gate front to kill the dragon faster?
I love that point crow is playing a different adaptation of BOTW
E
This man really just started speaking in the language of dark souls messages
"big rock no kill"  -Crow
eeeeeeeeeeeeee that was an interesting journey...  WHY DO YOU KICK PUPPIES?!
It sounds like he’s talking in elden ring message language
The comedic timing of the editing is amazing
Cant believe he didnt say Unga Bunga
I... Am Skill
I am skill *proceeds to fall to his death*
I love how the first letter of the first word of this video is e
This would be sooo good with Yoda's voice.
Why did the “okey” not count?
6:49 strat no work big rock no kill
Instead of zero, you could always use "zilch".
He sounds like the random messages you see on the ground
He's talking like one of the in-game messages
Crow trying to avoid saying E is like watching a Skinwalker try to pose as a human and trying to speak the english language and I love it.
that seems like so much fun lmao
I think you literally could've just talked like a neanderthal the entire time.
This was his best video
bro sounds like gru
Damn AbbyBagel must've been a champ at the school Spelling Bee to catch all the times you used the letter E, there are so many times I wouldn't have even noticed.
I love the moment he says yep at the beginning because he opens the door to immediate doom
"I can't say E, DANGIT!"
This is infinitely more funny upon reading the description and realizing that the meteor had to be manually spawned in, so someone was just sitting there and relishing the look on Crow's face as they ran the meteor command for the umpteenth time
Margit isn't a mini boss
I am skill two seconds later dead
yes yes no nono no
So you basically had to communicate in dark souls messages for an entire stream. That's some dedication.
eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
can't believe pointcrow kicks puppies smh
9:34 “I missEd it” I’m dying man 😂
Pointcrow sounds like a fricken caveman
How many Rhadans will this spawn? Ha! I didn’t say E…! Wait, god damn it!
If nat geo wild wants a caveman documentary. Hire this man
Ohio = Caelid confirmed
5:28 "bossEs soon"
Can you play the full game pls
does the mod add tracking to the meteor or something? should be quite easy to dodge it
i go to ohio
"I... am skill." Immediately dies
can you play 100 days of ARK survival evolved please
Skin walkers when you let them watch to much tv 5:10
Kevin from the office playing Elden Ring be like:
we should give a name to the viewer who kept talking about the puppy
More e'teror gameplay, for the other bosses?
8:01 poor tortoise
DougDoug does it better
My favorite part was that you got better at this challenge as you went along. Lol
God this is funny asf
the meteor had me dying the entire way through
Wait. This isn't Scott the Woz
Radahn is waging a war against definite articles of speech.
Not going to lie, this guy seems like he kicks multiple puppies.
Go through Ohio with this mod. All of it.
Not trying to be a hater, but it’s less fun with him cheesing bosses USING THE PUNISHMENT
"What's up with airbus food?" really made me choke while eating dinner.
"I should find a good fight stick." Didn't know you play fighting games.
Special ed got the experimental video game classes first. Unfair
Those are not meteors Those are miniature suns from Utsuho Reiuji like Utsuho Reiuji is sending miniature suns his way. oh I just got a idea every time you say u Utsuho Reiuji would just ends your life
3:30  That's why I can never really get into streamers they're so reliant on their chat for anything even emotional support
“It KILLED him” uhh… killEd?
Shout out Doug Doug
“He doesn’t kick a puppy, he kicks multiple” has to be one of the funniest lines of the video.
Ah yes Margit, the famous  *mini* boss
dougdoug 2
It really is a good haha 10:40
11:42 to 11:45 should be clipped and used as a new meme format for propaganda purposes
bro said E too much i stopped watching it's annoying asf how much u failed
0:42 florida
The best part is the ending. ”Yes! Yes! …nonoNONO-” and Then just cuts to end screen. That is how to end a video.
E .
Bro speaking in player notes
Open the Gate
Ah yes, caveman haikus
"Foul...Guy"
😭😭😭😭😭
Why do you kick puppies.. WHYYYYYYYYY 😭😭😭😭
I’m glad your doing something different than BOTW
I forgot
Wat game is this
Oh baby i dont understand this...........                                                                                                                             Grilled cheese obama sandwich
Chat was really milking the puppy thing weren't they hahaha
Don’t kick puppies
people who say spaming E is cringe be like:
8:50 hey guys its me!!!!
XD "margit mini boss" - he is way harder than godrick and both of them are a joke. and pro tip: u can just roll through radahn 🤨🙄
Aw man that was such a creative idea PointCrow, I'm loving it!
Bombs away!
“big boy dragon in ohio”💀
How do you made this man? Amazing idea!! ❤️
E
just dont say the lttr E man its that asy
Did he not know about blood loss?
I love when he said "I am skill" and proceeded to fall to his death
0:32 "are yu-" disappointment dies
This guy gives off major Simon vibes and I love it, he's hot too so that doesn't hurt
3:34 look at that eyebrow movement
at 3:35 he looks like the guy that says "burger with no honey mustard"
He really tried completing the challenge before accepting reality: E encompasses everything.
Rush e
E meteor
just... dont talk?
puppy
Okay Mr. Morino this game seems like BoTW
This had a theme like it’s a doug doug video
Me : How did you get those meteorite ?  You ：W"e"lp... "A METEORITE  HAS APPEAR" Me: I see. "B O O M!!!!!!!!"
8:18 you can never leave
PointCrow is slowly losing his reading comprehension one by one in this mod.
why do people always find this a hard challange just dont say shit tf?
I find it mildly grand that it isn't a big rock that brings you pain, it's actually just a big big man.
Big Boi Dragon In Ohio To Souls. This is amazing.
I wonder if he doged at just the right time if he could of avoided the meteorite dam
Who spells yup with an e? Lol
Will you please do more of these videos. I love these videos!! Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
Rush E
You can say “Garden of Eyes”! Just alter it to “Plant Location of Optical Organs” 😂

Eric stop i live in ohio
just dont talk, not hard
Imagine  you can't say the letter b
This game is easy     game: here comes a  metor
he talks like elden ring messages
9:20 is actually just welcome to the jungle by guns n roses
Pointcrow kick no puppy
this vid fun, I sub
i don't get it how this is hard just don't talk
Im laughing so badly
In another world, right when we comment E a planet blows up. Think about it.
Him saying i am skill and then falling of a cliff if the funniest thing ive seen all day
"I am skill"
could just stay quiet
Guess this explains the dog command
" i am skill " : dies : 🤣🤣🤣🤣
“Subscribe(E) now” and he did not die 🤨🫵
Now try not to say i I think it’s 10 times harder
Every time you say the word ‘uh’ the game resets or some other goofy encounter
I’m from Ohio the disrespect is huge why is Ohio so bad I live here it’s not bad
NO NO NO
This man probably has war flashbacks every time he says "the" now 💀
Life hack for the next time you do this, Eric:  Find a Filipino friend and listen to their immigrant relatives talk and you’ll notice that sometimes we switch our vowels and consonants but you can generally understand what we’re saying.   Once you got that down this challenge will be a cinch. 👏🏽
EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Stay away from Ohio and my home I don't need any meteors
Rush E

he turned into yoda for this as he want to jump to house ---> METEOR
Now imagine we all live in a simulation. That is how dinosaurs have died.
First ever video I have ever seen from you and I fucking loved it. Had me laughing the entire 13 minutes
1 minute and 48 seconds in and I had to stop watching for a few seconds to get a tissue and wipe my eyes. Like what the-
Funny has e in it
I bet you I can make you not say E.    How tall is ya mum    Yep that's right, none of those responses have e in it
Just the “need… uh oh.”
I am skill
It always brings a smile to my face seeing Eric face the same existential crisis I do on a daily basis. 😂
Scouts at 124 HP: Guess I'll die
E E E E E E E E E E E E E E  E EE  E
1:17 LMAOOO
Lucky the bot didn't notice a lot of words
Does it work if you don’t speak English because I think it would be great if you just spoke French all of the sudden.
This is fucking GOLD 😂😂😂
u funny haha good 1
9:32 the looks of amazement when he said I missEd it, and then immediately getting cremated by the next one made me laugh such a stupid sounding laugh
What if he just doesn't talk?
8:00 Dog :D
"I am skill"  *Proceeds to fall to his death*
bro kicks puppies 💀
Just don’t talk
As someone from Ohio, I can confirm it sucks
He pulled some serious caveman shit right here
Why didnt u jsut talk like Yoda? Victory find i must. killing boss i will do soon
How do this even work???
Big brain move: just don't add E to any sentence.
I just saw the weirdest AD of a Girl and a police officer sniffing earth other right before this video.  I am like:💀
Bro said "Where is down?" instead of "How do I go down?"
the slow deuteriation of a man into cave talk with broken English
him: "Margit mini boss" Me who took 6 hours to beat him: 👁️👄👁️
Also does any notice the meteor is radhan
Point Crow just as a heads up Margit is the first boss of the game
he sounds like a Baba is you player during this
This is one of the most entertaining videos you have made yet
E
The E-teor cometh
i alrEady fElt bad whEn i thought hE mEant just making thE "E" sound, but i fEEl EvEn worsE for him knowing that it's just any word with an "E" in it 😭
More of this specific type, this time with the letter C
imagine opening a giant door and a meteor just started coming at you
E
I need the perfect cut, with only the no 'e' segment's
ok. it's hard to speak and not use the letter e but, who says you need to speak?
Idk about a guy who kicks puppies but I'll support 😭
If you ever do this again, say thy instead of the, thy and the is the same.
12:02 THAT CUT
My name starts with E
Okay YouTube… this is the umpteenth time you recommended me this video. And Honestly… you win this time. I liked this…
Doug Doug rip off
I still don’t believe he doesn’t kick puppies.
My few remaining brain cells jumped off a cliff watching this
u a fucking poet
I used to think it was just Doug Doug’s TC that was super evil during these types of challenges and now I’ve learned that it’s all twitch in general
Do more of this mod!!! Finish the game with it
best suffer ever hahahahahaha
Now do it where each time the meteor's summoned you gotta restart the whole run :)
of course ohio
*"Strat no work ...big rock...no kill :( !"* 😂😂
This sounds like when a Japanese vtuber tries to do an only English stream
The
I wonder if raptors of the mists would have made this easy.
Can't even say E in Ohio💀
I have a solution   Don't talk
His edits have gotten really funny
Stop saying that he kicks puppies
E
I AM SKILL  *falls*  *dies*
I just came to point out that technically you don't say the letter "e" you say the sound "e", and no, I don't get invited to parties.
Lol the moment when i realized that the comet is actually just radahn entering phase 3
radahn really got a big kill count this time
Only here for the meteorite because this guy makes me wanna punch a wall through my own balls and face
"I am skill" famous last words
How does the game know you said it?
...Chat loves to harrass ya huh.
I don't kick... A puppy He doesn't kick a puppy he kicks multiple
Holy shit, its scott the woz
5:30 lol take
How does it work? Is it a voice activation mod or something?
Why is it so hard not to say 'the'? I thought by the 3rd or 4th time it'd register. Its just a grammar thing Without it things are still perfectly understandable, so idk why it wouldn't feel easy to say things plainly It's like efficient speak
I love this cave man talk! «Big rock don’t kill man»
3:09 soyjak pointing pose, I'm sorry
The IMMEDIATE cuts to the meteorite blowing the fuck out of the world is _KILLING ME_
this is hilarious
big dragon in ohio
I ATTACK WITH SWORD, but i guard with ass! DO IT! JUSSST DOOO IT!!!!        EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

a doug doug video not made by doug doug
Why does eric remind me of Jake peralta
I need more
"Hey guys in today's video if I exhale I the video ends"
He's speaking in dark souls messages
When they asked how many puppies you kicked you could say "Nil" or "Zilch" or "Nadda"
Ohio sucks: something i legit hear comedians say all the time as well as wyoming
This is the funniest shit I have seen in a long time hahahaha xD You just turned my gloomy day a little less gloomy, thank you :)

FromSoftware Lden Ring simulator
This is what speed running has come to now.
"I am Skill" *Dies in the most stupid way immediatly after*
Bro lost and killed the dinosaurs
"I am skill" *Falls to his death*
I like how on the third attempt, he opens the doors just to see a meteorite barreling towards him.
dougdoug ripoff
If this challenge killed him instantly it would've gotten stale in about five minutes, but because there's a delay of pure dramatic (and I suppose comedic) irony where he PointCrow doesn't know he just fucked up, it's priceless every time.
Why do you talk like Yoda
such an idiot challenge...
I love how he keeps trying to describe the concept of leveling but never realizes he could just call it grinding
BIG BOI DRAGON IN OHIO HAS ME CRYING XXXDDDDDD
Wait, Margit is a mini boss?!? I died over 100 times!!
I'm curious how rusty would handle this challenge 🤣
Some English speaker: *Struggles to speak without saying „the“* Southeastasians: „gg ez“
Simple... dont talk..
You know you english speaking people say I to E right? E is supposed to be read as in elephant not as in inteligence.. E is E, not I.... english is such a stupid language.. And its the same with A as well.. why would u read it EI instead of A as in animal..... english is broken too bad its globally spoken.
This is the most hilarious thing I’ve ever watched.
Best opening to a run like this ever. Instant obliteration.
were do i find merch
this is comedy gold
BraiN Go BrrrRRrRrRr
The realization that the "meteor" is just like 5-10 radahns during the bloodhound fight sent me into the stratosphere.
he can't dodge it lol
I saw a giant explosion far away irl. That might be a meteor
(breathes) HOMESTUCK.
This really reminds me of a party game called Poetry for Neanderthals, which leads to very similar shenanigans: you're only allowed to use one-syllable words so you talk like mad man no know good speech.
"Big dragon in Ohio" sounds normal 💀
Why does caveman kick puppies?
Ohio!, ... Florida😊 Ohio ... is to thE right ... 😶 instantly dies
b i g    b o i    d r a g o n    i n    o h i o
lol why doesn't be stay quiet during the dragon fight
Why did a gorilla cross a road? To find a thing! Best haha ever
he will never be able to say the word THE again
I'm... a good... work... guy.
Imagine begging for mercy and when you say, “please” a giant meteor says no.
I think this is genuinely my new favorite Pcrow video of all time.
Eeee
How did it even happen? Is it voice-coded?
e
Це атака ворожого стенда чи не так?
This looks a lot like Zelda
I challange you guys to say an sentace without E
I'm gonna use that for a D&D character now, this is the best way I've seen to get someone to sound like a negative int modifier xD
What game is this
“I am skill” and proceeds to fall to death 💀
just dont talk
That Ohio sucks man, big haha
Bro had a katana and used a great sword to kill the dragon
*"SUB NOW,  I think"*
Ain't that just radhan 💀
Dat wicked "yEs" at the end.  Peter Griffin: I'll be right back I gotta go take a wicked "yEs."
Alden Ring.
I thought this was a good show, happy job Mr. Pointcrow. Do this again and I will stay happy and watch again! But don't say that awful sound or you will cry a long span of hours.
EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
opaline bubble tear > saying E  COULD have been a true combo mayb ?
now you know how to be a foreigner who just started learning english
Have ? Why not use has for this challenges
THE METEOR IS MULTIPLE RADHAN'S?????
Had to get the thesaurus up for this one
Thanks crow for putting my donation in a vid it was meant to crack your caveman speech. Have a good day good sir.
The the the the the the the
Ohio more like die yo
Life Hack: Don't speak
mEtEor
… wait how did I miss this boss? I played for like 10 hours and couldn’t find progress lmao
Doug Doug would go insane trying the do this
0:39 this is really cinematic
Miss the Zelda.
Really gotta speak like the in-game messages to win this
Your sentence structure is no different than Hanzo from Overwatch lmao!!!
now do the whole game
Basically, you can say: "Thing is, you cannot fool my mind into using most common symbol of most popular way off communication in this world." and it is a good way of saying "I ain't saying E"
E
Puppy = bloodhounds fang soooooooo true
:(   i live in Ohio what you guys don't have dragons in Britan?
i don't even know what game this is but this was the funniest thing I've seen all week. Also, a fact, Ohio is indeed scary
it's just whenever the meteorite hits its so funne to see the world go bye.
unga bunga, ooga booga
Do this in zelda
Big rock no kill 😭
"A good fight stick"
So Yoda plays Elden Ring....GREAT!
E
8:00  "Dog!"  *fuckin murks a turtle*
big rock, no kill 🥺
bro why do you kick puppies
right sas he said i have girl and get hit by a meteor i got an add
Ah yes, the S O U P! challenge.
4:42 I am skill 😂
0:42 A perfect summary of FromSoftware! Opens gate to immediate death!
This is so entertaining
This man is speaking in dark souls messages
Bro the guy in the thumbnail is the same as the guy in the YouTube profile picture
these challenges are great cash grab no wonder hes happy
Subbed with an E
Halal
E
just mute your mic so ez pz
After all the Nerfs...hell yes it is easy
"I am skill" *forgets to jump *
Technically if you say e during the godrick fight it does mean you killed him
8:10 comparing Caelid to Ohio is gold 😂
words you couldve used that dont have e in them: “Eyes” “The” “Enter” “Meteor”
0:44 got me laughing for so long
"He has devolved into saying only a single word."
4:43 "I AM skill!" XD
Crow sounds like one of those Japanese streamers trying an english only stream lmao
The jokes sounded like those dudes in the human zoo from Steven universe talking
Dude going to have PTSD after this challenge.
ImaginE not kicking puppiEs to dEath, couldn't bE mE.
Now do the same challenge with skyrim!
Pointcrow go unga bunga words
"Are you..." *Instant regret*
Bro didn't get punished for "please please please!"
Everytime I hear that meteor I hear TFS Vegeta's rage yell
You should embrace the caveman and make it so you can't say conjuctions
"It Kill... Him! Victory!" Wholesome Crow.
4:10 you could have said zilch nada
"Find victory... in skill. I am skill." *falls*
How does this even work?
MORE ELDEN RING PLEASE
Hush E
I'm going to have a sip of beer every time you accidentally send a meteor and will comment again at the end of the video to see how bad this goes
Bro could litterally win in no time by shutting the hell up
Nothing like opening a door to be greeted by God's wrath
7:07 missed thingEs
“Find victory in skill….i AM skill”  As he falls off the ledge skillfully
Suffer on command be like
I'm surprised it didn't pick up the E in hehehehehehe
Was it based on chat saying E, E words, or voice detection? Or admin just watching stream?
ok this is to fucking funny i loved it :D
0:42 give that meteor a Netflix special
What makes this so hard is that E is a vowel
1:52 how souls games make me feel about dog enemies
Just stfu and you win, this such a pain in the ass to watch
PointCrow: "I missed it!" Also PointCrow: *dies by new meteor for saying 'e' in missed*
8:00 "Dog!" *slice
The puppy subplot complements this nicely lol
Everyone who tries this: THIS IS SO HARD Me: *Does not talk*
PointCrow but if he says makes any noise, something happens.
Its easy to do this challenge if you turn off your mic
this is by far your most entertaining video
Wait Margit is a Mini Boss? I needed over 5 hours for him...
10:18 And that is how comedy was invented.
Radahn LOVES when you say E, lol.
Get the souls from the dragon in Ohio
This guy kills our living ball instantly once this vid starts playing
It should have been only if you made an "E" sound, not literally any word with that letter in it, but it was an ok attempt at DougDoug's thing lol
Pointcrow The Puppy Punter
e
he sounds like he can only speak in souls messages
E 🗿
Meteors! So this is the backstory for the Georges Perec's book A Void.
goddick
this is the most boring run i ever seen
LMFAOAOO I WAS WATCHING THIS VIDEO AND IT STOPPED AT *0:04* BECAUSE OF THAT DAMN YOUTUBE PREMIUM THING 💀💀
As an Ohioan I can agree it does indeed the suck lol
Ausitm
the meteor being rahdan is just so gangsta lmfao
4:43 Me literally any time I say I've got this.
The fact that yall chose "yep" instead of "yup" is diabolical
4:44 LMAO
my man  that is radahn
Horrible fifth glyph
You coulda just said garden of optical organs for the mod maker
"the Eteorite" fucking classic.
Did this man just call a main boss a mini boss when he’s harder than Godrick
Man speaks in the language of Doge.
This video made me laugh
it sounds like he's talking in in game messages and i just love it.
this power is to strong
Loved watching ur botw had no idea u was playing elden ring now dang
This puts S[e]phiroth to Sham[e].
Instead of the you could say da
2:28-2:29 german moment
He definitly kicks puppys
You should play elder scrolls V skyrim
Homie called Margit a mini boss, nah G he's the tutorial boss. In all honesty Margit is more difficult than the next fuck with all the arms, godwickity the guilded or whatever
Bro talking sign language. Peculiar.
Man loosing a gift of speech.
why do you kick puppies
You should of said thy instead of the, like Melina
us want big amount of this. now.
"I am...skill" needs to be clipped
do the whole run all bosses
H3 looks lik3 a n3rd who would r3plac3 any 3 with 3 so I'd hav3 him g3t away with all mistak3s.
Bosses has an E and he wasn't punished for it  Money back
This is so easy just dont say anything this guy stupid
*the*
Felt like someone that can't say anything hard after dentist
Why no sub?
4:07 - Could've said nil, zilch, or naught? Hahahaha
The impending doom everytime the meteor comes 😂 makes this one of the best videos I’ve ever seen.
Neat video now collab with Doug
More!!!!
Yup I follow now
This forced him to speak like the random messages you find
Hey new here!! Btw dude you look and sound just like Andy Samberg I don’t know if anyone has ever told you that 😂 Great content!
Chad Radahn hating the letter E
3:34 Bro the eyebrow movement lol, he’s staring so hard.
Why is E now is turn word distort translat with forbidden letter at nd is and!
i think The reason why the strat of using the Meteor to kill Margit worked but didn't for Godrick lies in game design.  The Boss has 2 Phases, the beginning one and the phase where he Grafts the Dragon Head onto his Arm. Both Phases share the Health-Bar so it is technically possible to deplete the Health-Bar if you deal enough damage.  However like other FromSoft Bosses that did the same (Shared Healthbar but a Cutscene for Phase Transition) they will 'die' on screen BUT the Cutscene will still trigger, replace the Boss with the 2nd Phase which then dies again.  Since PointCrow dies during the 1st Phase of Godrick, it prevents the Cutscene from triggering as the game realizes he's dead and it doesn't need to continue to the 2nd Phase. So the 2nd Phase never dies and thus the Fight isn't won.
I laughed way too hard at 3:09 lol. ":O It kill! Him! Victory!!"
i love how the meteor literally just dont like you speaking
When pronouns are actually useful.
0:44  That was way too well timed with the opening of the doors
4:39
3:50
All of those meteors probably killed a lot of puppies.
Funny AF with captions!
Love the caveman talk, absolutely hilarious
"mini boss" margit is literally a boss encounter
My man been turned into a cave man
"I am skill." *Dies* -Crow, 2022
Imagine waking up and the first second you step out of your house a meteor comes crashing down on you, can't have shit in ohio 💀
theres a french dude that actually wrote a whole book of 300 pages without the letter E, while its also the most used letter in french. called it "la disparition", "the disapearance".  Bet the translators in other languages had a hard time for this one!
Would be better without saying the letter intentionally.
Damn Viviano Westwood went nuts
You should do this again with the same world but the 2nd boss
*Kills the boss* Yes! ... NO NO NO NO N-
"I am skill." proceeds to fall off a cliff
"I am skill." *jumps off cliff
Elden ring but Radahn is cosplaying an ICBM
> Margit  > Miniboss  Put these foolish misidentifications to rest
This boy had the audacity to call Margaret a mini boss
fUnI hAhAA
Great idea, and absolutely hilarious.
Daring if you to put the entire world at stake for this challenge
Best ER content I’ve watched in soooo lonh
he's talking like the dark souls messages you find on the ground
rodrick
E E E E E E E E E E E E E  E E E E E E E E
@PointCrow Jonny Razer is doing a Mario Party Tournament u should ask to join
Welp... going to have a drinking game with this video and every time we see the letter 'E' we drink. This is going to be fun.
This takes me back to that one episode of yu yu hakusho
This man isn't gonna have PTSD, but instead PTS E
you might've been able to use the iframes from opening doors to evade the meteor
YES! YES! *realization*    Ohio
Comical timing
Correction, if you say a word with an E in it, you get destroyed.
He could have just said thou instead of the
Doug Doug spinoff
I just love how he even stops to think about next word and still says THE 😂😂😂
Imagine if the computer thought your laugh was hehehehehehe
The
When you summon 5 in yugioh:
Please make more elden ring content
3:09 it killEd him
Just.. stay quiet? Not that hard
4:43  "I am skill"
so this challenge is why cavemen talked like this? then someone forget about it, said a word with 'e' and the dinosaurs all died?
That's my puppy kicker
0:42  That is just too perfect.  Opening doors lead to opening minds and hearts, one meteor at a time.
This challenges point is to make people return to monke and speak unga bunga language, did I understand it correctly?
He talks like the messages on the ground.
i would just resort to old english in this challenge "Thy first boss shall not slay thy iron melded soul!"
Take my sub sir this was hilarious!
He talks like the messages😂
I GO TO OHIO
4:10 could have said “not any pups”
I unironically live in Ohio
i don’t think even Doug Doug could do this challenge LMAP
The life of someone who just can't shut up.
PointCrow talk as if dumb. Big funny.
most of this challenge just makes him sound like a message you would read off the ground
Radahn will not permit E
removing vowels does a lot
I feel like I'm learning english again watching this lmao
Just be like me and go monkey brain and only ever say one word sentences… well then again I repeat the phrase E when stressed so yeah uuuhhhhhh
I feel so stupid after this xD
please stop kicking puppies
He sounds like the messages in the game lol.
Grug-talk good to not say bad thing
Well the E in the word easy is pronounced like I/i so you're fine.  Edit: Oh so the title is wrong. It's not saying the letter E but saying any word with the letter E in it.
as i was watching this hillarius epsiode i came to realice a that if speaking in the same way Yoda dose it actauly got a whole lot easyer "In pain, boss is"  "To florida i go"   "Kick puppys, i do not"
i like how he just ends up speaking like an elden ring message
Honestly this doesnt even feel like much of a challenge since the meteor helped more than it hurt but damn is it funny LOL
I wonder if Raptor/Indomitable could outlast the metiore strike. I'd assume not by the appearance of around 3-5 Radahn's, but a thought nonetheless.
i do find this vod cool to watch. Cant say that one abc symbol
"I'm a good work... guy?" "You're fired!" "But I didn't say...!" "You will" *presses button, Lenny falls* "Eeeeeeeeeeeeee"
4:38 What a quote
I don't have girl
This is like Dougdoug not trying to say like
How many puppies do you kick? Me: Two minus two.
0:43 thath matched so perfectly. Opening the door and seeing a meteorite fall
How do I do these kind of stuff? Is there a program for it?
Easy challengE just don't spEak
if that os the boss u can do all the game XD
7:10 was real good, loved that realisation from puppy.
I saw sevral time were he said an e word that was not meteored
2:27 bro started speaking German
7:30 Wait, that thing is _several_ Radahns?
Do you just kick dog pups oder also Wolf and lion pups in a Zoo for example? And are kittens included? I have to know
Crow should do a Dark Souls moan % but he can’t say certain stuff.
Most normal Elden Ring gameplay in Ohio
Simply NOT TALK
Most number of kicked puppies? One for every toe.
q gracia tiene si no empieza del principio cada vez lmao
He speaks the Ooga Booga language 😭🤣.
"YES! I DID IT! NON O NO NO"
This was amazing
$30 haircut. What's that about? Id pay 20 with a tip included max. Hey guy stop kicking puppies
PointCrow: "...thE..." Flaming sky rocks: "And I Took That Personally"
Dougdoug vibes
just dont talk
Local caveman abuses puppy whilst fighting gods in apocalyptic meteor shower world
Saw the thumbnail and I thought it was Scot the woz
Most used word with the letter E is the word called "the".
That’s actually radahn
0:33 that face
Finally, a challenge that isn’t just painfully easy to complete with the only option for failure being to deliberately lose for the sake of content
E cannot be countered
Unholy bird
The most common letter in the English alphabet is actually T.
"i am skill" *dies*
I subscribed because he said he’d kick a puppy
I -am- skill
1:55 missed one: "I don't kick puppi*E*s".
This impossible, finish ( whatever game) without saying A,E,I,O,U. I'll give you some room, you can say alternate sounds of em.
Man litterly begins the video saying "Every."
When you say my goal it sounds like michal
E
So this is why Kratos only groans.
0:43 there is something incredibly funny about this xD
say "thy" like the medieval times instead of "the"
That moment when he just salutes while the meteor is hurling towards the planet
Literally 1984
The most badass thing you could do is walk up to Goodrick and just say “Bye”
Sorry if I'm wrong but did you steal this idea from the channel "DougDoug"? He did a very similar challenge before this video was made, again sorry if I'm wrong
Roflmao this is totally hilarious.
A void
This visual shindig brings joy to my sight orbs.  Much fun is it to talk without saying a criminal sign.  Fun and innovation is abundant in this communication.
Yes YES!!! YESSSS!!!! no no no Noooo NOOOO!
I was able to understand everything he said all the up to “I think Ohio is ok”
should have used a bleed weapon it dose 10or30% i do not rember which oneit is but it helpful for big dragon
just don’t say anything
E and puppy stream without puppy
F
He talks like the messages you find everywhere from other players
Damn they put Sephiroth into the game frfr
E
It's hilarious that in trying to avoid using a common words containing that bad glyph, you omit so many words that do not even contain it.
YES YES NO NO NO
Man Rhadann made quite the impact for this mod
"find victory... in skill" -Tzun zu
PointCrow, thE almighty puppy kickEr, undEfEatEd god of kicking dogs.  edit: i forgot to caps thE lEttEr "E" from "thE". i officially hatE that word now.
bro they commited to the puppy bit
0:45 "Ah today is a good day" *Opens the door and see's the meteor* "Well it was fun while it lasted"
I'm not convinced that he doesn't kick puppies
uhm, you could have said nought
Could you use use roll i frames to survive the meteor landing?
As an Ohio citizen I can confirm all non-Ohioans are not ready to face Ohio
This guy should learn some german, japanese and chinese. While each of these languages contain e, many words he need dont.
I HAVE GIRL
wow radahn got out of his enprisionment
This is the hardest I've laughed in a long time.
"FiNd ViCtOrY iN sKiLl"  Pointcrow sounds like Yoda for most of this vid...
3:08 best reaction ever
I came here to see the entire world get destroyed 😔
Honestly, this was far more entertaining then I thought it would be. The comedic timing of the meteor was perfect hahaha.
“I AM… SKILL”  Immediately falls and dies on another npc on the way down
@3:20 "killed" no meteor.
Caveman plwys elden ring
Big boy dragon in OHIO! Seriously bro?
So wait... is that literally just like, 3-4 Radhans falling out of the sky and layered over each other?
one day he is going to do so many of these he will just sound like a cave man permanently
It’s Scott the woz
Imagine a no vowels version.
Dougdoug be like
Ngl, I'd resort to eating "EAT MY PENIS" as a war cry running up to bosses with this going on, lol
When he exchanged "I" for "Me", that was really big brain.
now i want to do a stellaris playthrough where if I say the word "planet", the nearest habitable planet explodes.
You knows he's in trouble when the subtitles start
I need a full run. For reasons
A bit silly in English where phonemes and letters differ so much but it's cool!
"that's my streamer" - 🤓
Talking like the Elden Ring messages
He talks in Dark Souls messages
Great Value Scott the Woz
WHY ARE YOU KICKING PUPPIES😭😭😭
The fact that he called Caelid Ohio tho XD
Every time I passed this on my feed I thought it was a new Scott The Woz video
So... Discount DougDoug?
1:05 mans really hit you with the "dont you lecture me with your $30 haircut"
just dont speak .-.
Alternative title:  Elden ring but Radahn is in his prime and hates the letter E.
"I am skill"
Literally could've just grabbed vow of the indomitable and abused the meteors on purpose
Kick but hole!
3:34 somoene please make a meme of the rock eye brow with vine booms please why his eyebrow doing that
big boy dragon in.... ohio.
How is the botw multiplayer md going? Is it gonna be public? Realy wanna play it with my gf 😊
I no kick many pups
Truthfully, Crow is making this look way too hard
0:40 imagine starting your quest, and as you open the doors, a giant flaming rock hits you
Wait… this isn’t Doug Doug
Him trying not to say letter "E" is like me trying to complete NNN.
I love that he called Caelid Ohio. It is a bit of a hellscape. Only more accurate representation is Texas, but he couldn’t say it.
This is like Outer Wilds
You know, you couldve said "da" instead of the :D
Reverse challenge; the world ends if you say a word that doesn’t contain E.
Dang Radahn must hate the letter E
trying to be funny: the video
Lol got my sub on this random yt recommendation. Fun stream.
Honestly the meteors falling from the sky arent the worst part of the weather in Ohio.
Me: " "
As someone who was raised in Ohio, "Ohio? More like let's die yo" is sadly accurate
Rahdanh has something personally against this tarnished.
every time he say E i was like "KILLER QUEEN!!"
This is whenever a Japanese vtuber tries to speak English
0:47 yup is spelled with a u not an e
mute you mic
Big rock no kill, me kill Godrick
bro turned into a caveman 💀💀💀
He sure IS skill
I mean you just stay silent.
some make a sentence that makes sense with the help of the internet plz lol
Point crow: doesn't fall for the chat tricks Also point crow: falls for his own tricks Edit: why are bots attracted to me?
....why didnt he just replace all "the" with "that" and all "are" with "is" .... here are real dialects out there that talk like that ^^
Crow: Th-  *Zooming Meteorite Incoming*
He is speaking the Dark Souls players language we inscribe on the floors lol
Is this really Elden Ring and not Dark souls? Never play either one of them so no jugment please
I was watching Shrek but with only ''e'', yt algorythm recommand me this lol.
Rush E: the destroyer of universes
Georges Perec is smiling from his grave
„Need..“ … Gets hit by meteor  … „Oh😀“
The Meteorite Strike at the opening doors at 0:43 honestly looks like an actual Scripted Cutscene from the Game...
“Ohio? More like let’s die yo” It’s so stupid I love it
7:49 HAHAAAA
Why say many word if not many word do trick?
Good skill up for RPing a barbarian.
Crow casually destroying multiple parallel universes
lole
This was big show of skill! Not saying fifth thing in row of things is hard, it is so common! Crow did good! I want other vids that looks similar to this.  Damn that was even hard writing no wonder he got crushed by Radahn so ofter
He found the one scenario where Sekiro would be easier
you could just stay silent the whole time
I am skill *Dies
Crow just sounds like that scene from madagascar escape 2 africa where alex just talks like a caveman
You can dodge the meteorite technically
That’s Rahdahn not a meteor
Radahn had a good day
How does the chat control the meteorite? And how does he ensure that it is not spammed randomly or unfairly?
Margit is not a mini boss, he’s the first boss.
Far too easy a challenge. He should've had to delete his save everytime he said E. That or never be allowed to use sites of grace. Any form of checkpoint is too easy.
Straight up started talking in Soulsborne messages
I appreciate Crow & crew.  Well made videos that're always good for a decompression session.
easiest way to beat it is to speak korean, doesn't use the roman alphabet
As someone from ohio, I can confer that ohio is scary
Hat* to b* that guy, but God you could ch**s* any outdoor *n*my or boss with this chall*ng*   If I'm not mistaken and r*cogniz* that "rock", you SHOULD b* abl* to mount torr*nt just b*for* th* rock hits and i-frame it, sam* with g*tting off of the hors*.  I do this in hard-man fight as I kill him partially, Am good win for angry fall attack.     Also, th* dragon approv*s of this vid*o.
This was easily one of the most enjoyable Elden rings stream I’ve watched
666k views lol
* plays Rush E *
This was probably one of my favorite videos ive watched so far this year
Please do this challenge again but with the whole game😭 it would be hilarious
this is a rally cool vido! kp up th good work!
Do it again, but you don't know which letter it is
hehhehe_
_testing
i got an _vony ad on this vid_o and i am gonna play along this chall_ng_ so i am not allow_d to say _
nglish bcoms a lot hardr to us without that lttr lol
The entire time I was wanting to tell him ‘just say thy instead of the’
0:45 i love how he opens the door to the meteor coming straight toward his face
This is like watching cavemen try to learn English 🤣
I like how he somehow dodged a meteorite when getting blood hounds fag
I love the idea that Radahn tracks you down if you say "E."
tf is going on with ur brow at 3:34
This vido is as if ric rad an AI gnratd script, absolutly hilarious  (This video is as if Eric read an AI generated script, absolutely hilarious)
garden of eyes = planting thing of visual tools
Alt title, pointcrow returns to caveman
Foeoet
“I am skill” *proceeds to fall off the map and die*
"the" was your bane lol
He's talking like all the Elden Ring messages.
I wanted him to try using the opaline bubbletear to tank it to one shot godrick
I've never even played Elden Ring but this has to be one of the most funniest videos I've seen that was randomly recommended to me
11:21 "Ohio sucks man"
Sometime you should upload on of these videos, but without context. Don't tell people the kill condition. It's just a video of you talking like a cavemen and facepalming every once in a while right before you get obliterated by a meteor
3:09 the pure happiness in his face
No one talking about the whole dog thing
turning into yoda, pointcrow is
This guy is the reverse jerma. Jerma makes the most boring shit entertaining. Pointcrow has good ideas but makes them boring
I like how he wants to go to Ohio, knowing he wouldn't even survive an hour there.
“I should find a good fight stick, oh i can say sword”
Only knew him for 1 minute and 30 seconds and I already love him
Try not to say A
Dougdoug?
BIRB IN DA CHURCH
"That was so daisy"
"I am skill"  Proceeds to fall off of ledge immediately 👏🏽
Suprised he didnt just parry the meteor
"I am skill" *dies immediately*
Bro is speaking in Elden Ring Message System 💀💀💀
My favorite part is how he goes out of his way to avoid saying words that don't even have an E, just to say are or something immediately after.
My man sounds like yoda
4:38 perfect timing lol
So, grammatical 'e' and not pronunciation. Can't say what's harder, since the 'e' sound is so prevalent.
should've eeee when falling
“I am skill”  Proceeds to fall of castle
PointCrow: E  Meteor: Exterminate
More elden ring!
9:30 meteor used uno reverse
I am skill
omg u kick me
Yes! .......... *glowing light in the distance ..... FUUUUU *ded
Bruh, that flying rock play didn't work at all LMAO. Had to do it normally.
Most normal day in Ohio💀💀💀💀💀💀
Rehydrates do you kick pupies
the alien i captured in my basement slowly learning human speech after i left the tv on for too long:
pls dont killl my family
I like to point out that one can argue yup is spelled with a u
Are those just a bunch randons as the meteors
He could have just picked up the physic flask in limgrave, which (I think) has a tear that allows you to tank a hit, which means you can take one meteorite, so he probably could have gone into the Godrick fight, drank the physic, then said a word with E in it.
the yes at the end was priceless
The best part of this is the fact he was playing for 3 hours and didn't think to roll as the meteor hit to avoid combat
like many amazing gods like the E god Markiplier and a new legend Eric now E
Garden of Eyes and PointCrow. They were separate corners of my subscription list, and now they merged. Never would've guessed that a year ago
He’s just speaking in elden ring player messages
This happens everyday in Ohio
Perfect irony how this challenge has him talking like a message you’d read in Elden Ring 😭😂
Elden ring but if you say a word with "ring" you summon an elden beast
This is just PointCrow being a trad haiku samurai
I love how when Eric said yep it timed perfectly so his character just opens the doors just to immediately be obliterated by a meteor
Actually sounds like a caveman half the time
Me trying to communicate with the Spanish waiter
bEst final EvEr
i am skill
It’s a sped kid
yEs!!!!
Calling Margit a miniboss feels so weird when he's easily more difficult than Godrick
Hey Pointcrow, I don’t think I’ve ever seen that “Meteor spell” before. Do you know where I can find it since you have collectors anxiety and all? 🤔  (Holy shit, I just realised the “meteor” is five Radahns flying down at him! Hahaha!)
"I am skill" Famous last words
this is thE most youtubEr intro
E
This is literally Eric talking in Dark Souls messaging system
We got the challenge playthrough before the regular play through 😢
He's got a point. Ohio IS scary.
When he said "Big Rock, No Kill" I fucking felt that ☠️
"Unholy bird, now has holes" *Boom*
I love people just calling caelid ohio.
I Am skill. *Proceeds to commit die.
😊
So you like kicking puppies?
I don't get it this time. I've seen these types of videos before. Isn't it supposed to activate whenever you make the "eee" sound? Or, did you do a word bank of words like "the," and "are?"
didnt expect you to paly a souls like ngl
Every single time the letter E gets spoken the meteor creates massive explosions. The entire comment features the letter E because the letter E exist everywhere especially because English breaks when vowels are excluded
Alden ring is the best game ever so excited to see one of the best YouTubers ever playing it
"The margit miniboss" hmmmm
Now do it without saying any vowels
me when i kick puppies
Es in the chat 😂
Fun Fact: E isn’t the most commonly used vowel in the English lexicon. It’s actually A!
The meteor impact actually made the shot at 0:45 look way more badass. As he opens the door, you can faintly see its path, as well as its light gleaming just behind the door. And then the explosion just shoots through the door.
its weird how he stutters talking sentences that dont even have e's inside them
Just Radahn falling from the sky
This vid is big good, I joyful from it
Ess
Why are you talking at all?
This feels like trying to have a conversation with another player using only whatever the Elden Ring equivalent of the orange soapstone is.
If point crow plays gmod this would be epic
Could have said "I don't kick pups".
You said a bad letter is the name of the game
half this vid is eric talkin ike a cave man
EE
Nic gam play bro
Is the rules is you HAVE you talk? seems easy walk around lol but not a fun video i suppose
okEy!!!!
we NEED part 2
As an individual who who has a location of living in Ohio, this task was hilarious
Cavman brain no spaks Lttr
6:20 Dude literally sounds like a caveman xD
Feels like the silent e's shouldn't be counted...
nobody: me: isnt "i" the most used letter..?
Can you play the dlc for age of calamity
"big boy dragon in Ohio!"  had me laughing for hours🤣
"I AM SKILL"
I cant i will diy 💀💀💀💀💀
"this is old dragon. old dragon can't walk, so I kill it" this is the guy that TOTALLY DOESNT kick puppies
Radahn sweep
literally devolved to a caveman speaking
Ironically enough halfway through the video he literally starts speaking like one of those messages you find on the floor in Souls games.
The and Are, the Starscourge duo
I like how it basically makes him speak in FromSoft player message language
You could just not talk
golly wow!!!
“Find victory in skill, I am skill” point crow 2022 before dying
Puppy kicker
You sound like the worst translation bot to ever exist. I love it!
He was just imitating a young French boy speaking english
Who or what triggers the meteor? I thought it was him but he is surprised by the meteor coming sometimes when he doesn't know he said a word with e in it. And I don't think it can sense the letter automatically as that would be too finicky/complicated/inaccurate, right? Does a moderator in chat control it? That's my current guess but I think at least from what I remember it NEVER has a false positive or a false negative which a human would absolutely make some mistakes, right? Also how does a moderator in chat control the triggering of the meteor, which I am assuming is from an Eldin Ring mod, therefore on PC, so maybe someone is on discord with him and a mod senses what the moderator in the discord chat says. ? Or something else? Thanks yall
caveman plays elden ring
He starts speaking like the messages on the floor lmao
Let me just say, as a french speaker, this challenge would be literraly impossible.
Challenge is nice but cheese is there since all you have to do is say E on every fight. So getting their is the only real challenge other then that just one shot bosses with E. Wish the game knew what was going on so th3 Challenge becomes a challenge lol.
Sup-r funny th- whol- vid-o. Would lov- to s-- a whol- playthrough of this. V-ry haha.
w funnee
Easy cheesing bosses lol
Finally Now rush e can destroy more then just fingers,pianos, and sanity
Oke does not trigger it?
Technically, you are casting Meteor every time you say the letter E, so when you killed Godrick, it still counted as you doing it.
This was hilarious XD Can't wait, I hope it continu-  💀
I like how u can see the meat ball slowly fall while he opening the door
That face he makes when he’s confused cause he doesn’t know what he said, then he’s like “OOOOOH”
I love how it isn’t even a meteor, it’s literally just radahn     He has to hurry his way from wailing dunes all the way to limgrave just to meteor your ass
Oh. Nice
I can’t believe radahn would do this  to lovable streamer pointcrow smh
"I AM skill." >Immediately walks off of a castle wall to his doom  My face hurts from smiling so much, man!
Pointcrow: I am skill then just dies
4:43
Don’t invoke the wrath of me, The E God
Eric: "Ohio is scary" Me an Ohioan currently watching a snowstorm roll though my city "Yes it truly is"
“Find victory in skill. I am skill.” -PointCrow 2022
He could have used thy instead of the
"I am skill" *falls to death*
I love the parts where he went out of his way to use non proper english and say some like “me is good” instead of being safe and literally using proper english say “I am good”
this video is cool but it feels way too similar to Dougdoug's content
I am skill : proceeds to fall of building
Hello point crow, it's me, Ariados, here to tell you of what I've been up to. I have just finished working out at the gym. I am excited for when we see each other again. Although your Mewto is strong, he has no chance against me. Although my level is still quite low, my mindset has reached a potential for higher than yours. I have also called my good friend Piloswine and Saul Goodman to aid me in my case to sue you legally to avenge the children. Outside of the law, I am watching every single move you make! Expect to see me when you post next, I'll be waiting.
0:41 “The test wont be that hard.” *The test:*
were the puppies okay after this video?
You should do more Elden Ring, great vid!!!!!
What game is this?
Now this is the man who kicks dogs all day every day no matter what even if its christmas!
Never had I see a man vocabulary down grade this fast
4:45 talk about some bad timing
0:47 you wake up to see your death
I love how this entire situation is just Radahn having a huge vendetta against the letter E
Love how the "meteors" are just a bunch of Radahns layered on top of each other.
not only does he kick puppies, but he kills disabled dragons. for shame
Only in Ohio
Speak in old English
This truly is the-
the editing in this video is so good
7:00 what did he sayyy?????
could you use the vow of the indomitable and time it when the meteors fall
Wow Rahdan really hates the letter E
Love how chat became obsessed over the Eric kicks puppies joke.
He’s talking like the messages in elden ring lmao  Now, / kill / big Tree /
He’s talking like the messages u find in elden ring
He speaks in souls game message text.
good thing most cuss words dont have an e haha
Can't say no bitches
Imagine being bad at caveman speak
He comes to Ohio for Dragon souls? Makes sense…hello from Ohio
"Find Victory.... in skill....                   I am.... Skill"  -Eric moments before disaster
I thought this was botw till I saw the first 30 secs lol
Half of those deaths could have been prevented if you said thy instead of the
"Find victory in skill. I am skill" *Walks off ledge* Dude spoke two whole ideals (including the fifth!) and still f***ed it up immediately.    Anyone get this reference?
"ohio is sca"e"y" **doesnt get wrecked**
E
I love these videos lol
Missed opportunity: have the screen go black at the end only to hear “Hey you, you’re finally awake”
Andrew tate speaking caveman
It’s like a baby struggling to up level they’re sentence.
This was fun to watch. Good job fighting Godrick without using our dictionary's fifth symbol.
big boy dragon in *pause* ohio
According to a website Margot is harder to fight in the first play through than it is to fight Godfrey. Also if Margot is a mini boss then what would you call pumpkin head
Isnt the metorite just radahn?
My favorite moment is when he says "The"
This video made me laugh so much that I said 'e' and now my country is destoryed.
8:10 "Big boy dragon in Ohio" 💀
METEOR SMASH!
"the" pronounced as "tha" should be valid. its not E. for example "DA WATAH IS GUUD, I LIK TU DRINK DA WATAH TO HALP MY HP ARRT I GUUD?" notice how i never once said an e
E.......A sports It's in the game
Average day in ohio
3:16
The tree types of C’s, the letter the word and.. the liquid
You sound like a toddler in this video.
Ngl I think this is one of the best videos you have made so far.
Sephiroth aproves
it sounds like if the player messages all joined together to try to play the game
Stop kicking puppies
5:05 for the "bird in church" bit
I love that the meteor is Just radahn
E
Big Rock no kill first form of Godrick. :D
Yeeesss! More Elden ring mod videos 🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻
Interesting that complete and utter morons believe what they think
i am skill...   dies from fall damage
At 4:43 couldn't have been timed better
do not say ohio sucks if you say it again in another stream im unsubing
the
There is dragons in ohioh?
You could have used “da” instead of “The”
Point Crow this is actually so fucking funny id love a part 2
"big boy dragon in ohio" 😭😭😭
Crow, maybe try a reverse of this. That in every word you have to have the least used letter of the alfabet( besides X Y Z)?
E
the ending was so right timing
He changed his thumbnail for the video
I JUST REALIZED THE METEOR IS RADAHN, LETS GO LMAO
The fact he couldve said da or zee the whole time
Boy, would I be screwed in this with my username alone.
cant believe point crow would kick those puppies
When he was escaping he spammed please and no more meteors stopped him
You could do this for increasingly frustrating letters to remove as the bosses get tougher.  Vowels E, U, I, A, and O (that order so far), followed by tricky consonants like S, R, or T…  Or, of course, the legendary G. R. M. Combo.  Only a True Elden Lord could survive that one…
Man gonna get canceled 1:54 into the video dude
This reminds me of that Yu Yu Hakusho episode 😂
Editor needs to play Rush E over the final battle.
Ev- *explosion* that's it. that's the video.
I think point crow should ban individuals who post words with non-consonant two.
Please stop; I keep being dragged back to this video every time you say 'the'.
..the-
PointCrow, the skill. He is skill..
"I havE girl.. worth it."
It sounds like he's reading messages on the ground the whole time
I love this Elden Ring content. It's a perfect combo, one of my favorite creators, and my favorite game. Please make more.
Hey pointCrow I have an idea for breath of the wild try to beat breath of the wild but the whole world is malice
love how this basically forced pointcrow to start talking like dark souls messages
Wow, excellent editing! I watched the original stream and this was a fantastic and funny compression of it 😁
Man went from 1 to 0 brain cells
But Margit is literally the first boss though
If I say any word I nuke america
This is absolutely funny
PointCrow in the beginning: speaks normally  PointCrow in the end: unga bunga
The moment he called Margit a "MINI-BOSS" I knew I was in for something.
Where does point crow live
“I missed it!” proceeds to get hit with a meteor
" I am skill" immediately accidentally falls off the edge
Trying to make content worthy of ten million subs is a weird goal when you think about it. There's no conceivable way to figure out what MILLIONS of people like. I think what sticks is being yourself. Fake people comes and goes like fads, since you don't get to know their real personality the next impression wave just wash the plaster away. But yknow when you can feel you heart beat for another person, THAT's hard to just ignore when the next fab comes! It runs DEEP in our genome! YeahGNOME!
Ohio actually killed me lmfao
How is margit 1.0 à mini boss the guy took me like two hours to beat😂
loveee me some elden ring videos
“I, am skill”, these were Eric’s last words before he tragically passed 😢
The screams every death are the best part. Edit: Wait no 4:44 is the best part! Edit 2: Nevermind the end is the best part LMAO  Also  EEEEE    EEEEE    EEEEE    EEEEE    EEEEE E             E             E              E             E           EEEEE    EEEEE    EEEEE    EEEEE    EEEEE E             E             E              E             E           EEEEE    EEEEE    EEEEE    EEEEE    EEEEE  EEEEE E EEEEE E              EEEEE  EEEEE    EEEEE    EEEEE    EEEEE    EEEEE E             E             E              E             E           EEEEE    EEEEE    EEEEE    EEEEE    EEEEE E             E             E              E             E           EEEEE    EEEEE    EEEEE    EEEEE    EEEEE  EEEEE E EEEEE E              EEEEE  EEEEE    EEEEE    EEEEE    EEEEE    EEEEE E             E             E              E             E           EEEEE    EEEEE    EEEEE    EEEEE    EEEEE E             E             E              E             E           EEEEE    EEEEE    EEEEE    EEEEE    EEEEE
I am crying. This must have been so fun live.
4:38 "Find victory in skill- I am skill."
4:43 : "I am skill" then proceeds to die the most...easiest way.
"I only kick two minus two baby dogs"
My favorite part was at the end of the stream, when he revealed that the one who activated the meteors was actually Abby!
I like how he goes from the beginning of the fight to him dying and you could just hear the tts saying "get scammed"
My guy sounded like sensei Wu at 4:39
PointCrow role playing as a -1 int char.
This is amazing
The puppy kicking gag feels like a DougDoug video
"50 THOUSAND?!"  70 thousand: 💀
pointcrow: I am skill. 4:45 Viewers: congratulations you played yourself.
"If I Say th*e* L*e*tt*e*r ' *E* ' M*e*t*e*ors D*e*stroy th*e* World" the world got destroyed 8 times now
Big boy Dragon in Ohio XD 8:10
I am skill
That was a great stream to witness
No one told me Ohio was kicking it this year...
If I took a shot every time he said E, I would be arrested. It’s funny, because I can’t legally drink. Please laugh
I just realized that Radahn is falling out of the sky to smite you every time you say "E"
Stop kicking the puppies crow!
Can we see more of "fake" point crow
Eric: *spends stream trying to convince everyone he doesn't hit dogs* Also Eric: *Finds dog* (7:59) The same Eric: *Hits it*
I love how Crow admitn't to kicking several baby dogs and follows it up by doing that.
We *dies* Us need *dies* Us must have *dies* Us must watch you play the ga *dies* Us must watch you play until finish You must beat *dies* You must slay all the bos *dies* You must slay all big bad guys and finish the gam
ooga booga underground man talk duration.
yEs hE is thE bEst
Technically he should have died when he said “bye”, but I think it registered as “by”.
This video blows
I am skill *jumps off*
Runes, not souls
Oh my God he doesn't even need to SAY E, as long as the voice xommand recognizes there's a mute E hidden in the word 😂😂😂 But half of English is E! I jjst started the vid, this is gonna be a trip
“If i fall, I’m taking you with E!”
If I could afford a console that can run elden ring I would definitely watch this.
This is so funny I E
Now do it without ever saying ə
I thought Doug’s “if I say” challenges were hard, this is just brutal but so funny
The sound followed by complete annihilation is hilarious!😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 Genius!
lovely weather we're having ehh?
It's like watching a very skilled 3 year old die over and over because he said a naughty word
“Big rock no kill :(“ 6:51
I enjoyEd thosE hahas a lot.
E
I think Ohio is ok 👍😃
I like how he gradually devolves into speaking like the player messages lol
Says words with E   Sephiroth: *spamming Meteor*
Bro changed the thumbnail 3 times 😭💀
“E” *God will remember that*
Nic vido, Pointcrow sms to rally lik puppis !
Dude. This video was HILARIOUS. I could not stop laughing the entire time. We definitely need more of this!
I whant to see all fails back to back all in one video can’t wait for it to just be “please” in the middle of everything
I have not laughed so hard for awhile. That ending 😂
i love how you can just see the light of
Lmfaoooo this video is too good
I couldn't beat Margit. I wanted to enjoy the game, but I got stuck and had Hyrule warriors bought for me so I kinda got sidetracked. Then I just now find out that fight is a mini boss? EXCUSE ME?
Aw man I was so- *ugjdfyffyvjuduvu*
can’t believe he kicked puppies to make this video :(
“I am skill.” *Dies*
“I am skill” *falls down and dies*
the whole interaction at 3:16 has me CRYING
The way he tries to talk does sound like the messages players leave behind in Souls Games
i laughed WAY too hard at that ending omggg,, fantastic vid 10/10
It would've been so much funnier if they had "Spawning meteorite."
Just don't say anything like 99% of everyone else who plays single player games. How is it a challenge to not give commentary?
EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Did crow just say margit is a mini boss?
To  be fair I never heard like say the actual letter E
ironically his sentences made me start thinking of those buttons people use so their dogs can talk
If this was my video: “If I say the letter ‘E’ Radahn vaporizes me”
I love the beginning parts of the video with the E TEORITE the parts are just so funny I cant stop laughing, and I've watched it like 10 times 🤣
this is so Easy 🧊 this is so cruEl   If you know you know
Bird! Bird in church! Unholy! Kill!
You should totally do this with more games!
Bro sounds exactly how I speak in spanish
I have a name with e in it
Three thumbnails? Darn
Just say, “that’s so dumb, no way” over and over
The ending was hilarious 😂
I am skill *dies*  :D
Next video is going to be  "Real life but controlled by my stream chat" Someone's gonna pay to send "Kill PointCrow" but it'll be over right there
I honestly wanna see you play ds3 and bloodborne with dlc
Play Sonic Adventure without saying the letter A
I played the version where the meteor falls whenever you say the n word.
so cruel*
There's no reason that, "OHIO? MORE LIKE LET'S DIE YO" should be as funny as it is.
I  the first 6 seconds he says E 13 times
This was positively hilarious
"Find victory in skill, I AM skill."
9:30 crow pogchamp
Laughing
I’m so happy you are making Elden Ring content! Can’t wait to see more.
I see you've changed the thumbnail. 🤨🤨🤨
1:16 I................. have girl
That ending was the best. Never count yourself done until you save after a battle. xD
Next do dark souls 3
I love when he opened the door and the meteor destroyed the world
Great video, keep it up, funniest in a while
4:39  “Find victory, in skill. I, am skill.” *jumps off ledge*  - Pointcrow
"I am skill." *falls to death* 🤣🤣🤣
Finally he’s playing Elden ring
PointCrow the puppy kicker
Ahhh Yes,  "ldn ring."
He was talking in elden ring floor messages
Pointcrow kick dogs?
he hate puppies. get him.
This was a great video, love the challenge!
"I am skill" immediately jumps to death lmao
Can you make tutorials for this?
“I am Skill”  *falls to Death*
It’s always the easiest words, you don’t even think about that get you in the end…
PointCrow is so evil, he doesn’t even just kick the multiple puppies once, he kicks them *TWICE*
Every time I see this video it has a different thumbnail.
Funniest POSSIBLE way to end the video, thank you 🤣
5:02 Bird in church unholy
omg he said "kick dog" THAT MEANS HE KICKS PUPPIES
E
He just straight up sounds like Gilbert Gottfreid when he overpronounces his words and it's amazing.
I'm sad I missed this
SPOILERS FOR THE VIDEO!!   I think he didn't kill godrick because he has to wait for godrick to finish talking before it counts as him killing him. So if he makes a part 2, then he has to kill godrick for real
“This is thE Start”  Ah, so you’rE finally AwakE?
yeah I didn't really like this one.
E
I missed it 😮  BOOM💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥
The best part is that he cant say elden ring or meteor
Fifth glyph moment
13 minutes of PointCrow returning to monkey
YOOOOO, finally a elden ring video
e e e
EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
you should do Elden ring more
Ohio is scary
the kicking puppys is like the second ariados
Well done mate. This format of videos bang. I don’t even play dark and enjoyed the shit out of the video. Well done.
i love the cuts to him dying from the e-tior
Cant manage without the most common letter in the English language  Sounds like a skill issue
3:49 seems like it could be a vine 💀😭
My romantic girl companion found this vid amusing. I and that individual trying to avoid part of word
Hey pointcrow, I just started a YouTube channel because I love yours so much, can you please give the ZeldaSpot channel a shoutout. I only have 14 subscribers and it came out just on Tuesday!!! Please give it a shoutout!!!😀
Those puppies didn't deserve it Eric
Radhan’s on fire for this one 🔥
My name is Ricky…
Lmao What’s going on in Ohio?
The alien locked in my basement slowly leaning words
That’s not a meteor.  That’s radahn smiting you for kicking puppies
first 🥇🏆
Why is this video full of animal abuse talk?
ElDeN RiNg wHaT
No
i didn't know u were into haiku
what's a pirate's favourite crime?
0:47 That is a powerful sequence  "Hmm, let me leave my castle and OH NO WHAT IS THAT"
Hmm... now do a Wheel of Fortune Level Challenge!  You need to level up from 1 - 100+, then reach the Second Boss!  But if you say ANY vowel (A, E, I, O, U, Y) then you lose a random amount of souls (based on the wheel rotating) because you had to "Buy a Vowel".  And if you don't have enough souls to cover the amount that's picked, you lose ALL your souls, 10 levels, and 10 random skill levels at random, so long as they are above Level 1... unless it's possible to bring them down to the Negatives.  Oh, and also not having enough souls when you say a vowel will make you just randomly get launched over a thousand miles in the air, because why not?
He died so many times he started to talk like a 1 year old
Cool 😎
'I missEd it' 💀🤣
god playing with a meteor thinking its a volly ball and thinks it will come back:
How to make the meteor never spawn: dont speak
Scam! Cool!
This entire video is just the green-screen explosion effect our straight into the game.
Margit is a MINIboss??
IT KILL :D
I think for saying words like VictorEEE then that should count
YouTube’s Closed Caption program has gotten really good. It even knew to highlight the letter E just for this video.
Pointcrow: If I say the letter E, a meteor destroys the world Also Pointcrow: R  Meteor: and I took that personally
He talks like me when i started to learn English
Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeese
The Finish is just perfect.
"Bird in church... Unholy"  I don't know why that got me.
Bird in church
Pointcrow: E Radahn: and I took that personaly
Bird up
This moving photo is good haha
Can you PLAY zelda again pls
SUBSCRIBE HAS AN E, CROW. NOW U SHALL PERISH FOR ALL THE DOGS YOU KICKED 13:08
Let's be clear here: Elden Ring and all of the DS series promote the wrong things in human beings.  As a consequence, the Elden Ring community is seriously over-represented by people who are just plain scumbags.  These are people who seek attention with messaging that means nothing, or who intentionally seek to disrupt another person's game experience at practically no benefit to themselves, or who see running and skipping away from conflict as the appropriate path for facing adversity.  As a social commentary, this game sucks: It enables beta males, like you, to lash out against their own inadequacies by hurting others.
4:14 You could say "Two minus two"
love the video 🤣                      you better do poke wilds next stream or else
This is similar to DougDoug! :D
I am skill ahhhhh -erick point crow 2022
This is beautiful! 😂😂
The end got me lol
Nice video PointCrow! It was so funny 😂     *Do not kick puppy* Edit: pls don’t
Pointcrow: “Maybe I can doge it!”  Also Pointcrow: *dies seconds after*
Just use is instead of are
This was just a DougDoug steam with a different protagonist
THIS IS REALLY GOOD CONTENT
Never watched elden Ring...
shout out to excluding the fact he didnt even turn the mod on when he started
big boi dragon at ohio 💀
YOU MEAN MINIBOSS?! I thought the magic hammer boi for 4 hours qwq
bro speaks like those messages you see on roundtable table
I play cool things for fun it’s kinda crazy with no Es
MARGIT IS NOT A MINIBOSS MY FWEND!!!!!!!!
Funny how E is the most used letter and THE is the most used word
What a pain for Radahn. Having to transform into a shooting star on so many occasions must tax his mind and body significantly. Ta-da! I must say, it isn't hard to avoid that fifth glyph at all if your will is strong and your mind is swift.
Help Eric kicked all my puppies and now I am puppyless.
Eric be like I am skill immediately dies
yes
how much time was spent dead
Starts talking like the madlibs Pokemon phrases
8:01 Did you just kill my brother in law
Should have just started saying thy instead of the
YO HES PLAYING ELDEN RING
The bird always had holes :]
i'm glad that DougDoug's challenges of not saying a certain word or letter are getting more recognition
THAT ENDING LMAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
165248th
there are so many silent e's in english
Who comes up with these 😂😂
CavemanCrow
hey, i made it into the video! nice!  was a real fun stream xD
YEs yEs  . . . NO!
Amazing how he was forced to talk like he was a floor message
"Big rock... no kill..." I feel you man... i feel you.
absolute banger of a video
I have a feeling I am not welcome here
You did it! That took how long?
R/yesyesyesno
How does it detect it based on spelling? Does it have the entire dictionary to reference when e is said?
wow
Vigor-cheeeeck
"I missed it" *dies immediately*
This isn't Doug Doug
"I am Skill" *Fucking Dies*
“I am skill “ *Immediately falls off edge
E
Its a shame the mod was made by a guy people don't like in the Souls community
Big boy dragon in Ohio... haha
The suffering.
DougDoug's trigger word is "like"  PointCrow's trigger word is "the"
Tumbnail changed: from heal to cruel   Edit: he changed it to easy.
It's like he doesn't know English lol
return to monkey
Do more of this, its soo funny
"Yes. Yes! NOOOO!"
I’d like to think that Madara is just chilling on cliff somewhere just listening and summoning meteors
sapphire: *sneezes* eragon: watch it! you almost burned me. sapphire: what do you want me to do about it? imagine if lightning struck every time you raised your hand. or if a meteor fell every time you said the letter E.
Simply reading out the title causes a meteor to immediately hit your location
this gets so degenerate lmao "the", "there" and "are" are such deadly words for this challenge
just shut up lmao
That was really fun
I can see and over abundance of "e" on these comments, but I don't see an equal ammount of meteorites, shame
foul tarneshed
PointCrow is going to look up in fear every time he says the letter e from now on.
Now do the whole game c:
Couldn’t PointCrow have just announced most with an e incorrectly like the as tha (pronounced: th-ha)
this vid-o is lik- you hav- a h-ard attack🤣🤣
MorE
Here’s an idea, play the Pokémon creepy-pastas lost silver and mount silver
This challenge has made him hate one of the most common words; The
dEath and dEstruction arE prEtty cool in my opinion
LOL
Damn that music at the end sounds like its from the pointcrow anime lol
4:42
bruh and why?
Something like 5 minutes in and chat is already accusing crow of puppy kicking… oh twitch chat, never change
Post more Elden Ring videos please!!!
Fun fact : "La disparition" by Georges Perec is a ~ 300 pages french book that doesn't have any "e" in it.
I definitely haha'd😆
“I am skill”
As soon as you got to phase 2 on Godrick you missed the chance to say "Yo, Godrick... Kneel" (Parodying his earlier "KNEEL!" remark) and insta-killing him. Though I'm sure you wanted to do it legit, I wouldn't have been able to pass up the badassery.
O but eric Godrick is not the first boss.
Now do the whole game like that: D
Now do the whole
I wonder how this mod works 🤔
dog. here?
what's that Music playing at 13:05?
e i was in the botw stream when you had the idea
What is this puppy kicking narrative that chat has created
nice
Just watched Eleven from ST play elden ring for 13 minutes 😂
This is a good way of playing in a virtual simulation of a world that is dismal and scary... uh writing this was difficult, haha! What I'd rather say is I do like the word challenges like this one, it's always good fun. :D
I absolutely love videos like these lmao, Wilbur’s and Tommy’s video still has me in tears every time I think about it, somehow this is just such a funny concept.
Ironically enough the guy attacking you in the meteor has no "E" in his name (the "starscourge" part doesn't count)
PointCrow out here trying to be DougDoug.
please stop sending meteorites to ohio, i live here
Like a intelligent caveman
Absolutely hilarious video!
He do be speaking yoda tho.
Reminder: this guy has a degree in Chemistry and yet come stop saying the letter E 😂 thank you Eric
Only in Ohio 9:10-9:15
My favorite part was “I missed it!”…..PSSHHHSWOWOOO☄️💥🔥
This is just outer wilds
i love how you can just see the light of the meteor slowly get closer and closer
so, how does it feel to be a puppy kicker Eric?😂
you sound like a chinese tourist
Killing a puppy is a joy doesn't use the letter E if you want PointCrow.
He really rushed his Es...
"I am skill" immediately falls off
I am now convinced that cavemen forgot to invent the letter E
I'm tired of this world, everywhere I see, there's just cringy dissapointment
I love these challenges so much, they're hilarious to watch
you look`s like i'm learning english for the first time
Wh_n th_ l_tt_r  _  is d_ath and suffer
You are the smartest YouTuber I know because most Youtubers dropped out of school😮🎉😂
Should have just named this video point crow talks like a caveman for 13 minutes lol
As someone who lives in Ohio, this game is accurate - our dragons do just sorta lag around for protection.
hahaha just lov't
"Unholy bird" is probably my favorite part of this
I like how crow turned into a poet and a caveman at the same time
This is one of the funniest videos I’ve watched in a while lol
“It …..KILL ……HIM….. VICTORY”
can u do this just with the entire game with elden ring specific words
*ahem* "What sort of challenge should we do next?" "Who cares, let's combine the alphabet with a natural disaster."
Video of a speech impaired person trying to beat elden ring
i just love those voice recognition videos keep up the good work
You talk like DougDoug when he can't say "like" in Smash Bros
This but without being able to pronounce r’s so he has to do UwU speak.
More Elden Ring please
This dude will think for 20 seconds about his words so he doesn't say E and then proceeds to say a word with the letter E anyway
"Find victory in skill!  I   AM  SKILL!" proceedes to fall of the building and dies 🤣🤣
Eric is just too weak for Ohio
Oh, oh no, I messed up big time.
Those meteor aiming at Crow reminds me of...Smash Ultimate.
I'll drop a thumb up, this visual show was big time funny
the
now with skill up pointcrow can successfully die 3 times
I am a fan of "Souls Ring" computer play, and would want a part two. I am of an opinion thinking it would display fun for watching. You could fight full moon scholar, strong Ohio man, long satanic thing, horn illusionist, blood lord, sword of brother, and final boss!
Now, let's do the same thing but avoiding saying the letter F because... "EFF!!!" (I think I watched too much of Alphabet lore.) ^^'
"BIRD IN CHURCH, UNHOLY, KILL... KILL UNHOLY" absolutely sent me
Its still said that the maidenless tarnished still fights the golden to this day
As a human in Ohio, I can say that my land will turn bright quickly if I say words with "E", but "E" with nothing is fine :)
3:09 - 3:13 true caveman moment right here
There are a lot of villains in your stream chat
This was hilarious
i love this so much - gooooood video
Talk like the in-game messages challenge
he doesnt know how hard "T" will be
Could have used Thy
Abby would've had to be SO awake for the entire stream lmao
i love when he's being incredibly careful and still says E. it's like doing acrobatics over a rake only to still step on it
Ohio ok
How dare you kick pup e
Not sure if I should sub to this guy, he kicks puppies.
I have the impression hear a guy how to try to speak a foreign language 😂
He lost the challenge. DO IT AGAIN!
comment for the algorythm
12:17 he said cursed nobody notice he wouldve died and had to do it again lol he had to anywaya though so doesnt matter lol
Congrats now try to do it in french
Yo they have to stop with these puppies
8:40 Uh friend that’s Detroit
That part where you said damage was so relatable. You said damage and the gods have granted your wish.
I kind of want to see if my build could tank that meteor because I think it just might
The ending is literally perfect
Why not us th mtor to kill godric and  avoid th mtor
man was talking like he was disabled
"I dont kick puppy.... Okay" -Pointcrow 2022
So he never said e
The puppy joke throughout this had me dying.
do more elden ring videos!! this was so fun to watch!
PlEasE do thE wholE gamE
just cant resist the letter e huh?
let me just say i love your videos so mutch but your streams you act a lil frustrated could you tell me why this is???
another great video as always, keep it up!
Funniest gaming video I've seen this year
This meteor was brought to you by the letter E!
bro was so mad with the birds that his brain went into overdrive and said the exact words needed to show how mad he was
am skill
PointCrow is using awkward dialog. 😂
Radahn is tired from all the falling.
Every time I say the letter E, a meteor falls and destroys the world. Oh, also I nodded legend of zelda
I dont think it counted that last time
This is like watching a caveman being introduced to video games for the first time.
Idea, implement this in your boxing match with toast. Basically get interviewed between rounds and if you use e you have to take a punch
Bros talking like a Darks Souls 3 message
This guy did NOT just call Margit a "miniboss"
3:12 he said killed with no consequence
Why waste time say lot word when few word do trick?
4:39 best clip I’ve ever seen. Perfect quote followed by the most point crow thing I’ve seen in a while!
Best vid to date. U were right during the stream earlier. S tier content 👌
really loved the ongoing you kick puppies gag
in the evergaol i was so hyped to see radhan spawn in but it was stolen from me :(
Alternative title: thE puppy
when i saw godrick die from the meteor i was so sad he wouldnt see the second phase cutscene, glad it didnt work
Today we learn that pointcrow IS skill
That was fun... now finish the rest of the game like that.
nEEd morE of thEsE strEams!
"I am skill"
"IT KILL HIM. VICTORY!" Biggest caveman energy ever
in tears, thank you
Funny haha!
8:20 the pause as he just looks up in futility
This was funny motion photo. I am fond of this motion photo. Good job, crow.
I love Eric wailing on the dragon for ages  despite him starting with a katana hahahhahaha
The poor puppies :(
1:26 best comedic timing
Now you need to make videos like this but for each boss         Including malenia                             that will be fun to see
The meteorite is the actual best thing ever omg just it coming and engulfing the screen and you can see it it's SO GOOD probably the best if i say word something happens concept I've seen.
ending song?
I thought it was ghost of tsushima:(
How could you leave out that Abby was controlling the meteors the whole time 🤣
Hello, Ariados jr here again. Are you sure you haven’t seen my father recently? My family is really struggling without Him. Please help
Wassap I love elden ring and I can help you a bit
I haven't genuinely laughed this hard at a youtube video in a long time... Incredible video, incredible mod, well done - can't wait to see what's next!!
The best moment was him just saying "I have girl" and saluting when the metorite
This give major dougdoug "like" energy
Wake up Robert
Feels like your content has been getting better exponentially with every stream. Loving everything you’ve been putting out, keep it up ❤
*sad dougdoug ripoff noises*
Amazing and cool such a hard thing to avoid saying no synonyms for a lot of words :P
"I should find a good fight stick" Me playing with sticks: not good, not good, nope, trash, ah finally, a good stick. Time to hide it. Now I need more
You should've said: I wouldn't kick any puppy or dog, and I hadn't in my past.
This had me dying
Eric:"dogs are cool" 10 seconds later Also Eric:"I'll kick any puppy i see"
E, the most common letter in the English language. Perhaps you should have started with an easier vowel, like U? Entertaining nonetheless~
I GO TO OHIO!!!
E
Should’ve brought out that Shakespearean, Thy and thou would have saved u a lot of grief
its like watching yoda play elden ring
F̲s in the chat for point crow, may his soul zzzz in harmony
Double upload, double upload right across the sky.
Soudsoud
That’s my streamer right there!
One of our cats peed on my clothes and I needed sth to cheer me up, this vid could not have come at a better time 🙏 (For the record we think the cat's sick rn but he also poops inside just to mock us so idk man)
I love these elden ring videos
Elden ring but I can only speak like a caveman
“i am skill”
now THIS is content, who needs anything else
Part 2 when?
I didnt know what to expect from this challenge but this is absolutely hilarious
that's for the laugh! (which is bad cause I am listening to this while working, no regrets by the way~)
I love that he calls the hell zone Ohio
So I know this pain, for like 6 months I couldn't press E on my laptop's keyboard, you never realize how many English words have the letter E in it till you're forced to paste an E every time
Is the meteor rahdahn or a different boss
Can us as many subs to Pointcrow possibly obtain a part two to this form of haha funny watch thing?
Since the meteorite is Radahn can he just run toward the meteorite to dodge it? Just like you dodge it in the demigod fight
I was choking as watched Eric struggle through this,  it's so hilarious to watch!
lmfao this was so good
As someone who resides in Ohio I can confirm it looks exactly like Caelid and meteors do fall frequently
How are the puppies
The timing was on point. This made me laugh so hard! Keep it up dude!
This was a good one lmao
Actual caveman dialogue
'Find victory in skill' is a fir* lin*
looking for dragon souls in ohio was a bad idea, I didn't think anything there had a soul
God I love the editing. Even after watching it live, watching here, too, is awesome
The man who ended the world so many times, its surface looks like the moon.
I'm curious as to if PointCrow could try this difficult task in a similar thing, such as a past Souls product. Anyway, trying it out in my own wordings is, I must admit, ridiculously difficult: I constantly must look up synonyms, which is oh so frustrating.
Now do Rush E
„Big boy dragon in… Ohio“  Wtf is going on in Ohio
I’m from Ohio, so this is totally hilarious. Also- composing this without that crucial, titular symbol!
"Now, just need more-"BOOM **stroke sounds**
Couldn’t stop laughing great vid as ever, keep up the great work
I think Point Crow Knows not how to draw this word that is 'funny'. I find that funny!
I demand an I am skill shirt
S Tier content
i swear if u lose to toast... I'll be ok. But dissapointed. Not mad.
Plz tell me no puppies were harmed in the making of this video?
I didn’t know my home state’s in this game, I might pick it up now
I love how he just saluted when the meteor was coming
>:O  I GO TO OHIO  O:<
Loved this run so funny
I stg the editing at 1:28 is one of the funniest things I’ve seen on this channel
WHAT
You could have said -2 instead of two for the kicking puppy thing
8:00 dog!
But I would never do that! Lol
I can’t take this Ohio slander
@PointCrow.  Is for elephant 🐘.
The irony of him never using “e” when he exclaims suddenly is peak comedy.  ex: “I still got it!”, “such a long fight”, or “Ohio sucks man”
That.. Is a monster, not a meteor
This was on of th most imprssiv challngs I'v vr sn you tak on, Ric! Good job!
This has to be the funniest iteration of this challenge, solely because the meteorite falling just has the best comedic timing.
I got to say... I felt my brain melting throughout this video
thanks to pointcrow's stream we now know his true intentions of kicking as many puppies as possible
I would kick a puppie
outro song?
I hate dogs cats are extremely better than dogs are. e count: 8
funniest video I've seen all year
caveman wins!
4:44 "I am skill" *proceeds to fall to his death immediately afterwards* The way I laughed lmao
I need a full run of this. The editing, crow losing brain cells every second...the puppies! Crow should do a full run to show he doesn't kick puppies.
Two guys walk into a bar, first asks for H2O, two asks for H2O too, kill
Yay I watched this stream
i like how the meteor is a bunch of flaming giants falling out of the sky
I love how the first "miniboss" looks more formidable than BOTW's final boss. This just goes to show how hard this game is 💀
So was anyone else imagining the meteors as Galeem's lasers from the Smash Ultimate trailer?
Anyone know how the mod works like how it registers if he says e. Or is it manual and he has someone just Lazer focused on what he's saying I'm just curious
is the meteorite just radahns second phase entrance, if so very creative to the developer
Okay, this is my new favorite Pointcrow video. EDIT: Ending has me dying in laughter WOW.
I think it would be funnier if the thumbnail would be “I want to diE”
This video is just going to be Crow slowly devolving into caveman speak isn't it?
We are not a cult
I love seeing his english slowly devolve, I wonder how long it would have taken playing this game for him to start speaking in monkey talk.
I no haha at crow's hahas but meteor good hahas
Almost done with the VOD, this was an amazing stream! Really cool video too, I wasn't expecting it to come out so soon!
I wish the text wouldn't show up on screen so far ahead of the word that triggered it. Makes it real obvious whether a slip up is gonna happen soon, and makes it even more obvious when there's no slip up incoming Could have just had the captions the entire time, if you felt like it was necessary to caption more than just the one word with the E in it Actually, it would make it even funnier when he says more than one word with an E. The caption just gets longer and longer with each offending word before the meteor (or the realization) hits
The Great Gatsby Challenge!
there are defiantly dragons in ohio
Radahn is a fan of book Gadsby, but Radahn's can't good to you if you don't think lipogram is cool  writing this gave me an aneurysm- oh fuck i said the letter E
Banger  Was feelin' real down until i watched it. Thanks mr. Crow
"Find victory in skill." "I am skill." ~Words of wisdom with -E- ric
i'm from ohio, and i can confirm that ohio is constantly being showered in flaming meteors.
HE HATES PUPPIES!!!!
haha comically large sphere goes kaboom
I find this trial run so cool. This task to avoid a cataclysmic cosmic rock by banning and outlawing a communication mark (of which I will not say) looks difficult and is highly amusing in my opinion. Do this again, mayhaps with a dissimilar thing to play.
Honestly, what a top tier video. Good job.
The best moments are when he pauses for several seconds only to immediately say an E word
Why dose he kick puppies?
it's his caveman character arc
Raining meteors, typical Ohio weather.
The fact that the letter "E" is also the letter that appears the most in English words makes this even more interesting!
as a guy who was born and still lives in Ohio, I am very much offended at what you said about it
The editing is next level
I'd really love to see more Elden Ring content in the future.  It's always quality stuff and you seem to enjoy it plenty. Maybe now that you've sampled some high quality Fromsoft you'd be more open to playing Bloodborne,  their second best game. I know it's a bit on the old side but it's (mostly) aged remarkably well.
Where to can we download the mod?
I know it's technically correct but calling Margit a mini-boss after the collective ass-whooping he gave the community just feels...*wrong* somehow.
Thank goodness it's English and not French. We got it so much worse on the letter E!
The editing on this is so perfect
Probably the inspiration for this challenge, but a man named Ernest Vincent Wright wrote a 50,000 page book called 'Gadsby' without a single word using the letter 'E'
9:31 just when you think he dodged it 🤣
Cant wait for the T vertion of this Crow :)
Say E to pay respects.  Also I would love to see a full playthrough of no E talk.
This has to be the best series Pointcrow had done. Good work crow. 💪
"I.. Am.. Skill.." -Pointcrow falling of the ledge whilst getting stabbed
The editing was perfect 🤣
"Bird in Church. Bird in Church. Unholy. Kill." Got me to crack up for like a good minute straight. Probably the locked away trauma from my first attempt playthrough of that area shinning through
Such an epic mod, love your content
'Mr. Sun came up, and he smiled at m-"
AS an Ohio liver, I can agree that the dragons there do not move
4:44 “I am skill” then immediately proceeds to plummet to his death😂
did he just call my boy Margit A MINI BOSS?? how dare you
sup my dude God bless yall haha man this was so creative ahahah really cool
The E teor Approaches
I am skill
good trial, much humorous. maintain amazing work!
You could call this a speed run of the first boss. But for short, you could call it Rush E
Hey at least he didn’t say shrEck
That gave me an umstroke
Eric kinda sounds like Korone at times when saying stuff like "Bird in cruch! Unholy bird! KILL"
350
As a guy from Ohio, I wouldn't recommend it
I remember crow dieing to margit like 200 times the first time he played and getting "put these foolish ambitions to rest" get stuck inside my head. good times.
DougDoug, is that you?
WHY DO YOU KICK PUPPIES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!????????????????????????????????????????
"Big boy dragon in Ohio" 💀
Miniboss?
Now full Playthrough!
I can imagine this is somebody’s first Point Crow video, and now they know Eric kicks puppies 🦶 🐶
"I... Am skill!" *Dies immediately*
Unga bunga Crow point
Alternate title: If I Say a Symbol Following D, a Big Falling Rock Blows up All Things
Don't add W Don't add X And don't add Y or Z just add *Silent E*  **meteor of obliteration**
"I should find a good fight stick... wait, i can say sword"
Never seen anyone struggle this much with godrick 😂
it's fairly hilarious just how poorly pointcrow plays and talks without just an individual glyph from our ABCs. but I can do it so simply. foolish mortal
His chat is slowly turning into dougdougs chat (This is bad)
SO glad I got to be there for this stream. It was so much fun.
9:28  Y: Touch grass
All i learned was that he kicks puppies.
Good cool. Now do it for all of gam.
nice!
The amount of pure chaos is amazing
If I Say th Lettr ,a Mtor Dstroys th World
best vid ever couldn't stop laughing
I loved that stream! I especially loved watching the frustration pulsing through your veins.
Now that you’ve finally said E, I am dropping the charges of puppy kicking. You’re free to go!
Good Job!
Margit "Mini" boss?
Elden ring but chat takes control if pointcrow says E lol
I love how he followed saying 'YOU SHALL NOT PASS' with 'I can say that :)'
11:21 "Ohio sucks, man". Truer words have never been spoken
Just speak in soapstone messages, that’s a good start. “Forward boss, try victory”
why are you kicking puppies
I watched ur stram this mornin it was great <3
Can we get a part two of this? This is a really amazing challenge run and fun to watch.
this was a amazing idea
Third like
Cavemancrow
I don’t care if Eric lies about being 6 foot 6, my science teacher is 6 foot 8
the E is rela strong with this one
0:42 Made me spit out the water I was drinking.
Bro went the long way
Can this mod detect different languages, can I speak Malay and avoid meteor? Lol
Did you just mod it to summon radahn Phase transition.
E
Nice to see fellow Fang enjoyer. Not the best or most meta pick but it's fun to wave around an oversized Dex club.
big fan of the new outro
i heard you mention this during stream i did not realize the level of chaos you intended to unleash upon this realm the day of judgement is here e.
Fantastic show PointCrow big haha it was funny
now do it with a AND o
I absolutely loved this challenge. Had me laughing like wild.
SO random 🤣🤣
im not the biggest elden ring fan just not my kind of game but this was hilarious!!
how dare you filter out the best letter.
Big boom make Crow man sad.
E
Doug Doug looking kina weird
LOL THAT WAS SO FUNNY TO WATCH
Puppy kicker
That finish was good! You should subscribe! Oh shi-
Love to see you doing Elden Ring content, hope there's a few more of these to come
Yeetus the Etus
10:58 Citrus was right there
Very well made!
As someone who’s been to Ohio, can confirm it rains meteors when I say the letter “E”
EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
This isnt about video games 😐
That's hilarious lmao I hope you do something like this again soon!!!
Best video 11/7
can this same concept be done on breath of the wild? hilarious
This is what happens when you go to Ohio.
E
next is f
Cool
Relden ing
yes
Wow! Glad to see Eric laying Elden Ring!
HE SAID CROW AND NO METEOR
My two brain cells rubbing together:
Chat gave me doug doug vibes here
I am the 70th comment, I’m sorry
That ending though—
My man called Margit a mini boss
The has to be the weirdest video I’ve ever seen
This man is now scared of the letter E
3:56 Bad boy, is that what you call the multiple puppies you kick 😂😂😂😂
I once had to write a school essay like this
Radahn is having a field day
th momnt of ralization, Haring th mtor sound, and th chat combo  Incrdible
Epic video! So glad you decided to do elden ring, it’s an awesome game, keep it up dude!
E
stop kicking puppies pointcrow. you should be ashamed of yourself.
Right now I'm taking an ASL class, and every time you do one of these types of videos it reminds me of how ASL word order is translated onto paper, ex. "I" and "Me" are the same when translated from ASL into written (called glossed) Sign Language
4:44 “I am skill”   Famous last words
Yo, cool to see some Elden Ring on the channel!
Man said "are you" and just gave up. 💀💀
How many puppies have you kicked?
I’m so early
crazy bro
Pointcrow "I am skill" also point crow walks off a cliff
“I want the power of flight!” “I want shapeshifting!” “I want invisibility!”  Me, an intellectual:
“I am skill” Immediately dies
People alive in 2018 get the reference
Rush E hard mode
i love how you can just see the light of the meteor slowly get closer and closer
“margrEt”
aka, pointcrow but if he stops being a caveman a meteor destroys the world
I have only ever played elden ring once. It is the hardest game ever.
E
Peta would like to know your location
Currently uploaded 4 minutes ago and there's 170 comments and over 2000 views. Kind of insane
Couldn’t even say the name of the game you were playing 💀
E, also thanks Abby!!!!!
I had just sat down with food when I saw this lol so absolutely perfect timing!! Excited for more Elden Ring in the future!
