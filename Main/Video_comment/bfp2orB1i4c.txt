"Everyones gaining up on me." 🙄🙄 Have these people commenting actually been keeping up with the Kardashians?? Kourtney is the monster! Always has been. Shes sooo mean all the time to EVERYONE! If anyone tries to stick up from themselves, Kourtney becomes the victim. Girl bye.
It must be painful to see your children hurting each other because you are their Parent, you love all of them so hard. They’re your children, how can someone not care?
🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴DONT FEEL BAD FOR KRIS , SHE IS MANIPULATING KOURTNEY HERE.
They are beautiful. End of story. I could only dream of being as beautiful as them.
Kim walking out shows she knows she’s guilty & Kris finally seeing Kourtney being hated on shows how in a narc cult situation like this having someone like this break it, means so much
I’ve recently came around psychological papers about “Sibling Bullying” on Google Scholar. It is a serious and well examined form of bullying which causes serious emotional damage to victims… and it seems like the Kardashian family is a prime example for it. I used to like to watch the show when I was younger and rewatching the show it’s actually way more hard annd interesting at the same time from psychological points of view now as I’m an adult now.  When Kourtney said “It’s such a natural thing in our family if someone goes against what everyone else is doing, it just seems they attack” it’s a revelation of disruptive dynamics, a mob mentality, which really is a typical form of sibling bullying. Not to forget them questioning her friendships (Allison Rae) when she’s happy and situations like that. Rewatching the show is really eye opening and interesting now.
Poor Kourtney!
When her mom offered support, I started crying. I know what it's like to feel alone and ganged up on. To have someone say I see you and I'm here for you is everything, no judgement just love.
I love kourtney, kendell and kris the most ❤❤
That's how a Mother should do ❤kloe you take sides instead of being neutral or not taking any ones side at all
What happened between Kourtney and Khloe? They used to be so close
Khloe should have taken her tail downstairs w/ Kim. All those faces are not needed in this moment. If you can’t sit there like an adult and be kind and compassionate, see yourself out of the room and let Kris have a moment w/ Kourtney w/o you passive aggressively gesturing during their conversation. Grow up. 🙄
Well I know Kourtney value you.
I don't like Khloe and she is not Kardashian she is not armenian she is their step sister we don't know who was her real father but in their family everyone knows about it she just doesn't seem to accept the fact that Robert Kardashian was not her real father of course because he always treated her like she is his own child and he knows that too she is not his child but he still loved her like he loved his own children that's why Khloe also love Robert Kardashian and she thinks he was her father even though he was not.
On that fight Khloe literally said to Kourtney if i hit you you'll be nowhere something like that and then Kourtney said do it while crying.
0:12 i think kim is also crying here.
I thought Kris was holding a gun in the thumbnail lol
I always feel bad for kourtney
Kourtney is the last one and so too I😂 Remember Dublin for the £1.00 you nicked from my room in the hotel. Fishamber Street. Across the road from Christ Church. The Church. You should see they paving stones.
lol Kris has last edit so she knew what would be shown, she probably loved it for the ratings.
Gotcha my girl!
retire
Khloé always my fav❤❤❤❤
Episode???
Poverty
🫡
I didnt have a shot
😍
I was never mean..no ill anything
Elements😒
Remember when Kourtney and khloe used to be so close 😩 they had so many fun times at the start of the show
A connection between mothers and kids is something that is not studied enough. Shout out to all the mothers. To feel someone else’s pain like it’s your own is magical to me.
Khloe should have been there more for Kourtney. Kim is a manipulator and can’t be trusted. She will play everyone to look good.
I agree with kourtney when she stands up for herself or does not agree with her sister everyone jumps down her throat. And I think she values her kids first and marriage first which is CORRECT her sisters do NOT come first.
Courtney,  your sister's will support you NOT YOUR TATTOO HUSBAND
Chris  Just saying Yeah 😂😂😂😂😂
What fight was this again???
Kourtney is the black sheep and scapegoat for two delusional narcs. She really needs time out from kim and Khloe they are toxic and Kourtney is sensitive and way too smart to put up with their gaslighting b.s.
and of course kim walks away 🙄
Sì
Its been 4years now.. And this clip still makes me cry 😢
As crazy at it sounds I feel like they just had to fight it out to let go of that animosity
Sorry sorry everything
Khloe your wrong, Kourtney doesn’t need to works her relationship with you, it’s you who needs to work your relationship with her. Kourtney is the only sane in the family. Kourtney if I were you I would step away from your family till they know how to value and respect you. Period
Khloe acts like she knows what she talking about she doesn’t
Kim starts all that stuff because she treats everyone in her family like they beneath her. And nobody works like she does. And after a while it gets played out. A person can only take so much.
Was this after Kim and Kourtney got physical?
khloe really ruined her rep as a sister, all the kourt khloe lovers? this was our last straw. khloe changed too much. can’t believe she was ganging on kourt w kim of all people like that
This made me sad for her
This family I feel like it’s nothing about anything but money if you don’t got money, you can’t even be in this family. Sorry.
this clip really got me balling my eyes out when kris went quiet after letting her know she saw the clip and kourtney saying "thank you, i'm fine - i'm fine now" while crying with words of relief.. omg 😭
This family needs to put money aside and think about being a family as Kourtney said they need it they don't need more money 😮
Khloe should have stopped getting work done on her face after this. Her new nose and lips are absurd.
The fact that 3 years later, Khloe is now saying the same thing because Kim is billing her - ha 😂…. Kim is the problem
khloe is so guiltyyyyy
Oldest sister scapegoat! I felt for you here, Kourtney. Detaching yourself helps you stand in your power.
What season and episode is this?
Kourtney is so strong, I remember when Rob was the one Kim always picked on and constantly called a loser, her ego has come at the cost of her siblings mental health.
Kris reminds me so much of my mom.
Why are they so fake?
Kim is the puppet master behind all of this. She’s not a good sister
And khloe use to be close to Kourtney
Kris Jenner & Kourtney Kardarashian Cry Over Last Season's Fighting Each Other - KUWTK - E!.
Family ❤
Kim was hurting too I can tell as she was walking away. She looked like she was crying.
This always makes me sad! They are such a loving family.
She already claimed Kim the  👹  is her favorite.She's just not trying to show favoritism on live tv but behind the scenes in reality she knows Kim is her favorite..Sad to say the truth but that's a fact.
Wow all of the Kardashian Women are lovely Khloe Kardashian looks 👍👍👍 gorgeous with her big loop earrings.i feel for Kourtney I think she is deeply understood by everyone I can somewhat relate to her she is still worthy of all the magnificent things she has accomplished in life
One stupid question... the Khloe's eyes are blue or gray..  or not brown?
Khloe is the worst
you know not one lick of housekeeping goes on with those ugly fake claws
Awe that was sad gulp 😢but they sorted it,it Wil be swings and roundabouts
Now Khloe wants to cry. Girl you were all big and bad with Kim and now you feel for Kourtney.
Just seeing a mother hurt that one of her own is hurting us heart breaking
Kourtney is the oldest. Coming from the youngest in my family. It’s special bond that mother and oldest child especially when it’s girl. Unless you them you won’t get it. They envy how things just come easy in sense for her badly no surgery or need to expose herself and maintain dignity and overcame bad relationship and found real love. They envy her life path and she could really stand on her own if she wanted too. Sad Id admire it but some children will feel upset about it but it’s nothing to be. They are all blessed so it’s petty 😅
When someone calls you & says that u can truly get over it ❤
Power of a bonifed apology ❤
I see the snake left the room. Damn bully.
Khloe sitting there and acting like she wasn't part of the problem is mind-boggling. She literally sided with Kim everytime, and they both bullied the hell out of Kourt for years.
kim is a nasty person
No one has been ganging  up on Kourtney! She’s the bully and ganged up on Kim for years. She refuses to be held accountable for her actions. She attacks others constantly and always wants it her way or the Highway. She never acknowledges her wrongdoing and always acts like she’s the victim!
Does anyone have a link to the fight they were talking about?
People forget that kourtney carried the show for so many years & nobody ever defends her not even her mother
I think Kim was always jealous of Kourtney because her life carried her show, and she never needed to be like Kim. Kourtney is relatable, naturally beautiful and self-conscious. And now Kourtney is in love because she wanted love for love.
Not Kim leaving cause she wasn’t the center of attention. She always leaves when it’s not about her and btw she does it in all her episodes in the kardashians the new one she always has to be the center
I’m glad Kris can see how Khloe and Kim bully Kourtney. That was validation for Kourtney. I’m glad Kris made that clear in front of Khloe. Just a shame Kim didn’t have the balls to sit around and hear it.
I’m sorry but Kourtney is not innocent in any of this….
I think Kim should have stayed for this the way Khlo stayed and listened
Kris loves all of them but she’s just so Lazer focused on keeping all them rich. ❤
Kim is the family bully, and when she targets someone the rest of them all fall in line.
Which season is this ?
If Khloe wasn't so much about Khloe she would be knowing how Kourtney feels as she always said in the past she felt like the outsider but Khloe is too obsessed with the new Khloe she forgets her old self 100
😂😂😂 ya funny 😂😂
Kim is like big bully against Kourtney
I thought kris was holding a gun in the thumbnail lol
Notice how fast Kim ran away to avoid any kind of accountability now that her mother actually sees her sisters side years later.
Kris is just amazing human being
I m hurt after listening to this sometimes it’s imp to keep everything behind and take care of the people u love . That’s all matters .
Yo why did Kim do a runner
You guys leave her alone 😢
Kris is horrible, she can’t even give her daughter a private conversation. Wtf is Khloe there?
The music really fits the scene ♥ Somebody thought about that.
lol Kim running away.
The problem and the one who caused everything is KIM
I hate that they hide behind kourtney's storyline to hide theirs let's talk about how Kris  bought  a church back in 2008 so she doesn't have to pay taxes let's talk about how Kim parades around the streets of LA sleeping with every man she knows let's talk about how Khloe  is on crack let's talk about how Kendall and Kylie both dated Travis leave my poor Kourtney alone and if she wants to step back on the show let her #hulu
Kim has a nasty mouth and attitude I think the whole family is stuck on fame and wealth and lost all sensus besides Kourtney
أي جزء هذا؟ وكم الحلقة؟
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Unpopular opinion kourtney is my favorite I’ve just started watching from season one and for some reason I’m so drawn to her
Khole is actually a nasty person if u saw the series... she got her karma back wht Tristan does to her
Which episode does kris cry?? As in which episode is this?
What episode is this?
Kim obviously never got a “hey sweetie” from Kris before.
Kris is better than my mom. Sorry mom ;)
The elephant 🐘 leaving the room quickly.  🤣🤣🤣🤣
Thank you. Wow kourtney was really broken here ♥️💔
The sisters forget that Kourtney is the oldest and probably been through all the bad before the little ones came along. The emotions she went through as a child. In one of the other episodes, Kim mentioned that Kourney used to drink a lot and their dad would tell her to go and make sure her sister is ok.  You ladies, no matter how much money yall got, appreciate that you have a mom and have one another.
kim started tat fight  delusional she is good for kourt for  giving it back to her
Kris is so understanding and such a good mom
Khloe is so toxic. I cant feel bad for her now. Maybe all the bad things that happened to her is just KARMA.
Kim smirking and getting up to leave just shows how evil she is deep down. She is so heartless... and khloe is becoming just like her. She only stayed to be able able to listen and report back to kim
Kim is her favorite
khloe is literally stunninng
what episode are they talking about?
You could see it in kholes face she knew she hurt her sister… I think she felt bad. Not Kim she just walked away
I cried when kourtney said “thank you”
Yup they been doing Kourtney bad for a long time...shame on Kim and Khloe.....im treated like that in my family and it hurts because its your blood ...expect it from strangers but ur own blood does something to u frfr....Glad Kourtney stood up for herself...
Khloe goes wherever popularity goes. If feels left out in family, cool with kourtney. I remember when she felt scapegoated. Now she plays active role in scapegoating kourtney and breaking it down with her hurt emotions  VS just ending it and acknowledging her active aggression. She feels secure to not be fam scapegoat and not seen by others as more importantly by make kourtney one and have it witnessed. It's projection.
Kris is such a good mom 💕
Omg love khloe she cares for everyone.
Being a person not being heard for so many years I felt her releave and released of emotions for her to heal just very touching  episode
What episode is this?
Why do they treat her like that
Why did they do this call on camera? This is just to prove that they're Innocent to the public nothing else. In this family only Kim & Kim's money are the boss. They don't care about Kourtney. This is fake emotion from Kris, just to keep herself in the clear
Kim got up right away
I dnt understand why people throw bad jabs at kris jenner. I feel kris Jenner is nothing but a good mother.. She is stuck between bunch of entitled as**le adult kids who make bad choices and make her do the clean up ... They should be thankful to her only if only she is mother any other manager would hv quit a long time ago..
Kim is so horrible. Honestly…
Which episode of what season are they talking about?
Everyone was ganging up on her because she is a horrible person. I legit think Kourtney is a narcissist. She is so ruthless to everyone but the second Kim or Khloe start being honest with her bad behavior she starts crying and acting like a victim.
This was actually why I stopped watching the show I absolutely hated the way Khloe & Kim treated her when she didn't feel great as it was,  I think Kourtney is adorable and look where she is now ❤️ she deserves happiness
Kim running away 😒
Which season?
Khloe is always trying hard not to laugh
Pure coven if Witches 🧙‍♀️
I literally cried so hard I know what Kourtney feels all of us have difference it makes so sad to think that sometimes people around us dont understand us but at the end of the day their family.So I know Kim and Kourtney love each other and always behind their back to protect each other.
What episode are they taking about?
This is my Favorite Moment of Kris Jenner. She Show us the is a Human.
Which fight was this?
Kim booked it out of the room FAST. And side eyed the hell out of Kris while doing so.
I honestly feel like this when it comes to my mom and my sister. This is why I feel for Kourtney.
After Kim and Khloeé had been calling Kourtney a lazy bitch for 2 years the mom is oblivious..lol unbelievable anything for social media meanwhile your family is falling apart
What season is this
Kris always favours kim,
Why khloe is laughing ?
They did this to Bruce, they did this to rob, and they did this to kourtney.. I heard kourt's point, so if somebody not going with the main cast "kim" opinion, they will going against you HARD..
Kourt🖤🥺
Poor kourt she's the most authentic person on this show.kim always criticizes her. She's been doing it for years kourt had enough. Not to throw shade but the older I get the more emotional I am. I wonder if perhaps she might be going thru pre menopause. And perhaps was having a hard time that being the oldest seeing her sisters have things that she  always dreamed of like kids n a life long partner. I am happy that Kris stepped up for her n Rob.
I love you Kris :'( mother's love
Kourtney is the only one I give a s*** about
What episode is this exactly?
Which fight is this ?
Dang it this made me cry
Why the bitchy faces from her own sisters?
All I can say the other sisters are jelousy of Kourtney that's why they always try to pull her down ,I really feel sorry for Kourtney she's a strong woman she have gone through a lot all these years
I feel so bad for kourtney
Kim got up and left... she couldn’t handle hearing how mean and hurtful she is to Kourt 🧐
Funny things is now 2021 Kourtney looks the most happy person of Kardashians family
my moms always put everyone else before me and recently we got into another huge argument- but for the first time in forever she finally understood me and listened instead of making me cry. the weight that sat on my back was lifted and i felt like i could finally breathe. When kris cried for kourt i cried for her 🥺
I'm crying because I cant wait for the season to be over!!!
Kris
im crying and i dont even watch the show 😭
kardashians: having a heart-to-heart for once kim: 🏃‍♀️💨
Kim's the 🐍
KOURTNEY is just real!!!!!!   All those others iew
I feel like the only reason this conversation happened is thanks to the fans backlash online, it clearly finally made them realize how much Kourtney was suffering and how bad they treat Kourtney.
Khloe  in between lol what should i do lol
which fight are they talking abt in this?
It's clear that Kim can't stand even hearing anyone supporting Kourtney because it's not the narrative she wants to paint of Kourtney being delusional
I'm had a huge argument my mom so my dad called me like almost exactly like Kris did,he said "I heard what happened when I was in hospital & I want you to know that I'm here for you I'll support whatever you're going through I choose you"the fact that he chose me his son in this situation & not his wife makes me happy
You can tell khloe felt bad for kourt
Khloe has grown the most as an adult... Bravo
Tbh I wish that instead of kourtney doing the show and complaining about having to do it or hardly filming, kourtney should of just left the show
You can tell the bond they used to have is lost. The more the money and fame came into the picture its almost like they werent the same family anymore. I think Kourtney also misses her dad which is probably why she acts guarded and so distant. People judged her so much without knowing her true pain and sadness.
I wonder if Kim apologized
Kris is good mother
Khloe ur guilty. Burning in the chair 😂🔥
Lol i thot it says last season 😂the fight was cut on the screen. So i was lik ok so they filmed it b4 ok
tbf thats their family dynamic...they fight big they make up big.  none of them are entirely innocent nor entirely guilty...
this was before plastic surgery exploded :))
I'm distracted by how in the scene Khloe's face is like 5 shades darker than her damn hand.
Kim is such a ****
But Kourt & Khloe use to bully Kim all the time. I mean they use to laugh when Kim did the ugly cry... sooo 🤷🏾‍♀️
It's so familiar! I know exactly how to fight snakes when you are have two sisters and you are born in the middle like the slice of cheese in the sandwich everyone wants to eat ...as you get older you figure out the only way out of the madness is to cut the cord. Family is not essential when it's toxic!
No Khloe.. you don’t give AF about kourtney!! And you certainly don’t value her!!
Kim is a bully
I love how Kim was the main person making kourt feel left out and she walks out of the room when kris calls.... and the khloe talks about their relationship but like, where is Kim????
I literally cried
Poor Kourt. I'm glad she got the recognition she deserves
Khloe if you wany Kourtney to feel loved and valued then TREAT HER BETTER
Khloe n kim such bullies
I don’t think Kourtney is innocent just because she cries....she once laughed when Kim cried and is a bully who doesn’t like it now that she’s being bullied too.
Stfu Khloe. You're the problem
To be honest i know kim has lil attitude way before kanye, but i feel like kanye just made things worst. I think he's no good to kim. Just my opinion
I honestly feel bad for kourtney
Kourt breaks my heart. I feel so bad for her...
This pissed me off. Kourtney had her life with Scott on blast for years. Main storyline.  We all watched her and Scott create a family.  🤬
khloe has always been the biggest bully it's disgusting
I hate it when you try to be strong on the phone. Your like I'm good. I do not feel emotional! I feel great! But then... you hear that stop in the conversation and you know the other person is crying and then you try to brave it out. However, the first word just breaks! I know that feeling!!!!
Everyone will gonna miss you guys😥😥
I know exactly how kourtney feels
I thought she was holding a gun
Kourtney and khloe hv been ganging up on kim for years
Why does the thumbnail look like Kris gonna shoot Khloe with a gun lmao🤣🤣🤣
everybody saying Kim is bad never watched the early seasons. the other was always mean to her rob and Kourtney especially when she was trying to help them she wanted everyone to eat at her table. Now that she has a voice to talk she's mean please stop. Kourtney has 3 kids Kim's 4 she just do not understand how Kourtney cannot managed her time for other when she can
I must be bored to be watching this
Im crying when I've heard she said ' thank you ' 😔
I feel horrible for Kourtney but with that said, she wanted the same money without putting in the same effort. She has ALWAYS done less and always received a third of the payment. It becomes frustrating when you are in business with family and they do not want to work as hard. Kim offered to let her leave more than once and she wanted the money. So, yes, they all love the money. Kourt is no different. The crap she sells is outrageous for what it is!
Honestly, when Kourtney started crying i start crying too.....feel really bad for her 😞
at least khloe feels bad kim has no remorse so being a lawyer is the worst idea ive ever heard
great stuff
What episode is this?
What was the episode ?
Kourtney and Khloe bullied Kim like this for yearsssss. I’m sure she didn’t think this would’ve flipped on her
If Kris really cared, she wouldn't have put her on speakerphone.
I totally understand how Kourtney feels. It’s so hard when no one’s on your side and to finally have someone see/hear you it is a huge relief off your shoulders. When you keep hearing that you’re the “bad guy” eventually you will become it.
I will always support Kourtney because Kim gets very bossy and just because your sisters are where they're because of you dose not mean you owns them !!
KOURTNEY & KYLIE  are the real Showmasters without them it would be so boring they bring Stuff & Drama in this Show! Kim has no character she had this bad vibe attitude? & she is jealous about Kylie!
Kim should’ve never said what she said to Kourtney. She was looking for trouble and it is exactly what she got.
It blows me up when I see Kardashians crying. I think they are water proof robots
Actually I saw the episode. Kim left because they were getting ready for a photoshoot downstairs and she was getting ready for it. Kris is also in a robe because she was part of the shoot.
I did tear up too , mental health is very important above everything else.
Such bull. The music. The crying after months of the fight happening for content. Such bull. So fake. These episodes air *MONTHS* later lmao. Yall dumb for believing things on TV.
i actually teared up. i feel so bad for kourtney.
I’ve always have a soft spot in my heart for kourtney, whenever I see her cry I start to tear up too. she had literally inspired me for my whole life
Everyone hate kourt but she is amazing  mother
my thought in here is that, kim has always been a self centered, she gets mad when she sees one of her sister being honest, living their best life and making their own decisions. khloe used to be the partner in crime of kourt but somehow shifted to kim for some reasons and kris doesn't notice what kourtney has been feeling through the years, but it doesn't make her a bad mom. In my opinion as an eldest too, the eldest child always sacrifices their wants for their younger siblings and I think kourtney is overwhelmed because no one noticed what she's been though even though she sacrificed the attention that kris should gave to her before and she play as a bully or lazy in her sisters eyes because she is living the life that she wants and just being herself.   sorry for my english
I love Kris as A Mom, y I cried 🤦🏽‍♀️😭
When kourtney said, thank you with a  silent crying voice. I really feel where she was coming from. The pain and the criticism that she got from her family. Really make me so sad, Why her sisters didn't get the point that they are all have different priorities. Why they can't just be supportive on what kourtney decision, after all it's her life and future, and if ever she failed on her decision, she can't blame you(kim). Just be happy to her and be contented. 😭❤️
Khloe is the best cancer celeb  I've come across so far....
Kim is the mastermind....she just wants to boss over everyone.... like she's leaving the room as if she has done nothing wrong....  Moreover she just wants limelight by somehow getting all her credits recognised and at the same time not letting others do so unless there's her name as the saviour....like she made so manyy videos about herself on her birthday....😑
Kourtney is such a lovely person 😭 Kim is toxic! She bullied Rob until he left, then Kourtney! I think she is jealous because Kourtney is more beautiful and natural. I think Kim is venting her passive aggression against Kourtney because now Kylie is the new queen👸🏻 !!
I really hope they see Kourtney's side now.
This is sad that Kourtney is being ganged up on all the time. But can we address the fact that they are putting way too much bronzer on khloe
I keep coming back to this because my own family won’t own up to their problems or reach out like Kris did in this clip. I just felt the need to say it.
What episode is kris referring to in the beginning?
I feel bad for Kourtney sometimes because she’s at a point she wants the cameras out of her life and to just live how she wants
I really was on kourtneys side through the whole 2 years of her fight with Kim and khloe, they honestly were just horrible to her, the way they spoke to her the way they treated her it was really awful to watch. You were watching someone try to grow with new values in their life and their family just being horrible to them because she wasn’t living the way they wanted her too. Kourtneys not perfect but I just felt for her. I find khloe and Kim very cold in their reactions the numerous times they’ve brought her to tears. Everyone always talks about the contract blah blah blah, kourtney and her personal life carried that show and the numerous spin offs for the first 15 seasons she deserves every cent she gets , it’s about time Kim and khloe picker up the slack for the last few seasons. Kourtney is her own person and that’s all she wants to be.. she doesn’t want to be the billionaire of the family, or the most famous she’s happy to hang out with friends travel and spend time with her kids while working on her lifestyle blog. I really hope they leave her alone and I’m so glad that the show is ending, I think kourtney will thrive personally and professionally without it.
0:31 when Kourtney says Thankyou its heartbreaking
Kim left that room quick
I think most of us can sympathize with Kourtney
I love this so much. I ❤️ Kourtney
🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺
this made me cry 😭
Armenia fired missiles on civilians in Azerbaijan Ganja. Armenia killed civilians, children. Kardeshians happy and funny
I hate the fact that Kim walked out & khloes crazy face expression  I wish no one to have disgusting sisters like them !
I feel sorry for kourtney because she put a lot of her business on tv and now she wants to pull back and they didn’t respect that but she respected them when they didn’t want to show certain things on the show and after 14 years of having a camera in your face for hours a day months at a time I’m sure everyone would want a damn break from it
Love you kourtney 💚💛🧡🇹🇹🤗🤗🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
Khloe is literally the biggest bully
My heart clenched when Kourtey's voice cracked while saying thank you, I'm fine now. 😭
Kris is really a mom
Wich episode is it ?
Y'll be ok kourtney ❤u
Just because Kourt can do it and you don't..she doesn't deserve all the hate.
Omg wow we can't get money from other people now.....wow.....people work through this as normal not camera people yet continue to give...this is them wanting money. And its sad.....there are so many people worse off and don't crave camera time to make it benefit them. They just work hard and move on because that's life.
Ugh, that made me so sad when Kourtney said "thank you" in her crying voice.  Partly cuz she doesn't show emotions that much, but also because she was hurting so much.  We love you Kourt.
Khloe and Kim are soooooo toxic literally.
My goodness these people look so fake...uggh. They could make a plastic surgeon a millionaire overnight.
Love KOURT❤️😘💗
If it wasn't for Kourtney this show would be absolutely boring.
I totally get this and im the middle child
https://youtu.be/sxX9m60nPL8
Why Kim walk out like Really.🤔🤨😑
i have seen two sides of this comment section-  one hating kourt because she's "annoying" and "not fun" and then when people are ganging up against her "omg i feel so bad for her" "she is such a nice person"  SHE is a nice person please don't switch up because nothing was happening to her, she is an amazing person throughout
BOTOX plastic surgery family
I will never forget the episode when Kim was so rude to Rob and told him "stop living your sisters' lives go make your own" and Rob was sooo sad. Few episodes later, they went  for therapy as family and Rob broke down, and he said he felt like he was alone in the world. That broke my heart.
Hearing Kourtney cry made me cry and sad 🥺😥 .  I love her coz I always felt  like she was the humble one in the family.
😍💝👼🙌🙏🙋
Kourt and Khloe used to gang up on Kim💁🏽‍♀️.
Large families could learn how to behave by following the example of the Counting On kids. They are so respectful and kind to each other. They are modest, generous, kind and display the love of God to the world.
Music please
At least she called and said she was there for her. My mother would and has never done that. Ha!
Kim saying Kourtney is irrelevant or whatever but wasn’t kim & kourtney takes Miami was all about Kourtney?
In the thumbnail I thought Kris had a gun pointed at Khloe 💀
Everyone go and cashapp me a dollar if they got rich off nothing so can I $KarinaQuiterio 😂😂
Можно перевоод
What episode or fight are they referring to in this video?
this ppl are to rich and unrelatable to the majority of ppl now, its like watching a human safari
Nice cute 😃❤️💜💛🔃
Such trash
Women are always crying. 🤣 I see what guys mean. But I cry too so whatever.
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻yes!  Show sucks!
I'm just here loving Khloé's outfit...
Kourtney is most likable Kardashian
I’m dead
Im really confused what happened and which fight? Can someone please help me and explain
When Kourtney cried I felt her pain.
I feel like the only ones who are the real adults and the mature sisters are Kourtney and Khloe.
Khloe is such a mess, feel sorry for her and shes back with that man child now, you would wonder how her self worth is so low for someone who has had so much she really has no self worth or self esteem. Wishing her the very best
I'm gonna miss this show 😭😭😭😭💔💔💔
i thought it was a gun she was holding in the thumbnail lmao😭💔 i said ✨teaaaaa✨
Sometimes I hate Kourtney and sometimes I love her😭
Khloe and kim ganging up on kourtney for a while it’s funny they said she doesn’t participate enough but kourtney just wanted to live a more regular life now that Kim is going through it with Kanye she doesn’t want her business out there anymore but they were pushing Kourtney I’m so glad Kourtney stuck to her guns now she can live the life she always wanted
I feel sad after watching this
I thought Kris had a gun in the thumbnail 😂
Kourtney is the most informed and health conscious mother!   She gets annoyed with the materialism within the family!
I love the Kardashians ❤️❤️❤️
I'm so sick of khloe. I wish kourtney would have given her that slap instead of kim.
Such a great mom Kris is. 😭❤
The things that Kourtney mentioned about their family attacking members within their own circle is so true. This is the same scenario that happened to Rob and now it's happening to Kourtney(myfavorite qmong them). I believe the Kris is smart enough to not let the same thing happen again and unfortunately she had come up with the decision to end the show.
The tan difference between khloe's hands and face is hilarious 😂
Khloe looks insane at this point
I even dont know who are they. The new richest family??😂 artist??
I’ll always love them 😔
Fony macaroni kloe
Oh Kourtney 💔
i understand kourt feeling some type of way but many of yall sound dumb as hell. nobody is mad at kourtney for not wanting to film, they're mad because after being given the option NOT TO RENEW her contract she renewed it anyways for the payout then went on to complain about having to film like everyone else. and on what planet did kourtney carry the show's story line?? they ALL contributed equally from the beginning, she just happened to stay with the same man for 10+ years. they ALL gave birth on tv, they ALL had long term boyfriends and let all the details play out on the show. khloe and lamar had their own damn spin off for gods sake. the only caveat is kanye and that's by HIS choice. kourtney also threw the first punch when her and kim fought so wtf are yall talking about??  this was just a fight between sisters nothing more yall just love reading comments and duplicating whatever psychoanalyzing nonsense the last person said
Khloe is such a good sister  She really tries to understand. Did you see Kim escaping. Haha. Jk. Reminded me of when my brothers would get moms sympathy. I’d be like hey dad didn’t you ant me to go to the store for you! Hahaha
Kourt is my phone she is the most real Kardashian. I  like that she still wants to ab individual  and is not overly  consumed with being at it girl.
Kim walks away......
I’m glad this is their last season. Enough of all this family drama. Just do your thing and stop getting plastic surgery. Your faces look plastic except for Kourtney.  Take care of your family and yourselves and enjoy life away from the camera....
Khloe was like “oh lord”
Please don't end the show its such a great show and its so sad knowing that it will end soon 😢 😔 😞 💔 😪
So are we gonna act like we didn’t see Kourtney for years be mean, bully, and negative to other ppl? Kim can’t take it anymore and now Kourtney is a victim.
I love Chris, she has so much to do as a momager and then to deal with this, if my kids would have done that I would have cried, Kim was so nasty and physically abusive
I love how Kris support her daughter and understand their feelings
I feel like Kris has always favoured Kim and for her to not be on Kim's side in that fight shows she really feels for Kourtney. I love that. I hope Kourtney's happy.
Everyone gives Kourtney hate like she’s so funny
I'm not gonna sit here and be childish and act like my eyes didn't start welling up when Kourtney said "thank you.." with a broken voice 😭😭 really pulled my heartstrings man ❤️
this is so sad, people give kourt hate for no reason; having that many sisters ganging up on you is the worst feeling..
They have to.live a normal life for once
🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
I hate Khloe why does she always on Kim's side actually she don't care at all hate her she will get what she deserve one day
Kourtney attacked Kim first 🤷‍♀️ was plain as day on camera
🤦🏽‍♀️
what a superficial family....krap krap krap krap
Kourt and Scott were the show for a very long time.
I love Kris she is a  good mother she is Always there for her children when they feel bad.
I love u kourt
Ohhhh I felt a mother's love through Kris. God bless their family.
I hate it when I gota hire another limo driver because he seen my true face and went crazy and tried to tell the world I was something other than human . Such a waste of time going through the process of orientation and screening and whatnot it all cuts into my soul massing. I must be rambling
I love You Mrs.Jenner, Mrs.Kim K.Ms.Kourtney K, Mrs.Khole Kardashian, Ms.Kendall Jenner & Ms.Kylie Jenner.
They hate on Kourt. Because she’s real & she’s not fake, they hate the fact she actually does what makes her happy regardless of what anyone thinks. She wants to actually BE A MOM BE W/ HER KIDS give them a normal life regardless if they famous they hate the fact she’s not 🥴 a fein about fame 🤦🏾‍♀️. Kourt the realist ❤️
They hail Kim but treat Kourtney like a stranger with pretenses.
Lol
I really hate to see moms crying 😭
Is Kris wiping tears with cash or a credit card lol?
I literally thought she was holding a gun in the thumbnail.
I once put a meatloaf under my cousin Jimmy's pillow. All summer long he dreamed of flying through the cosmos in a wagon made of cheese. It was fantastic! "Duh"
i thought kris was holding a gun in the thumbnail HAHAA
Just came here to say it deadass looked like she was holding a gun to khloe's head in the thumbnail 😂
I love how Khloe always own it when she's wrong, she's such a great human being with a great heart
I don't understand how can someone hate Kourtney, for what?!
There mom cries a lot I thought she was a Pisces like me because Pisces people are very nice, creative, and sensitive.
This will help you Kardashians https://youtu.be/JMkwJi2YNtU
Total rebound.  It's like teammates that only select genji and won't change. It's like, you can't deflect it all, and we're on a team. It doesn't matter how fast you can enter what you want to say.  When what you've needed to do is always replaced by what you want to do, you just won't be able to deflect all the criticism. What did you expect, a small victory to hide all the betrayals?
I also realized that they have been disrespecting the eldest one which it kourtney and then kylie disrespecting kendall like?? Why? I feel like they are forgetting themselves and they should know that their number priorities in life is the family.
Kendal and Kylie fights 😂😂😂 Hilarious https://m.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&v=_KUTyEZaGEA
I hope they find their ways in understanding each other cause at the end there just siblings and for a mother to see her kids going through that is heartbreaking.
Kim has become such a cold, offensive, and hateful person since being with Kanye. Khloe pretty much does whatever Kim does. Kourtney has always been her own person which I can respect. She's college educated,she didn't feel like she had to date only one kind of guy because that's what Kim mostly did,and she's matured alot.
It make me really really sad to see Khloe: 😐 no emotions
I thought she was holding a gun in the thumbnail
Plot twist it is all because is Taylor swift 😂
I felt so bad for Kourtney...but her fighting back should have been a wake up call to Kim. Kourtney chooses to live a low key lifestyle and her priorities have always been different. So for someone to downplay your roll and then have the other sister Kohle defend Kim and blame Kourtney it was craziness!   Kris is not a bad mom she just is not around to step in and correct Kim’s behavior. They are grown and should know better and apologize.
I legit thought Kris was holding a gun in the thumbnail
When will this horrid show ever end?!
I thought kris had a gun in the thumbnail 😂
Which episode are they and what are they talking about??
I don’t get when the others said kourt don’t give enough. Literally how she got with Scott, all the cheating, 3 kids, got back together and broke up is all on tv. Of course she wanna step back a little while. You can look up kourts personal life like a freaking archive from a library.
I want this show to be in every country of the world 🥺😭
yahl are so shady to kourtney for no reason
i thought kris was holding a gun...
Feel bad for Kourtney.. It's really difficult when you've got nobody by your side.. When you need them you have nobody's shoulder to just cry on. And it's disturbing when you own people make you feel so
😍
they should feel bad for the way the treated Kourtney for the past two years
Which fight are they talking about here? At this point it’s not even a fight.. it’s basically kim bullying kourtney. There is difference between fighting and bullying. It was straight up bullying. Kim has to be the nastiest person to ever live. It became extremely hard to watch kourtney being humiliated day by day by her sisters. No one even came to help kourtney through her situation. She suffered and endured everything on her own..How blind can this family be?
You guys see Khole feeling guilty??? Mmmm
People out here losing homes and dying and these pampered drama queens are trending... pathetic
It show is becoming more and more drama and less reality
Kourtney deserves better and I hope everything goes amazing for her and shame on them for saying that she was lazy and not hard working when she carried that show for years and is a single mom as well she deserves so much appreciation
Finally Kourtney , is not being seen as the bad guy , she is one of the sweetest and loving persons in this world . Im glad kris finally found out the truth
The end is no longer near; the end is now HERE!  Tomorrow may be too late for you; no one is guaranteed tomorrow. We are all sinners and the wages of sin is eternal death in hell! REPENT and ACCEPT JESUS CHRIST as your saviour today in 3 simple steps.  A - Accept that you are a sinner in need of a saviour B - Believe in your heart that Jesus Christ was born of a virgin, died and shed his blood for our sins, buried, resurrected on the third day, ascended to heaven and is seated at the right hand of God C - Confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is lord of your life.
Now Kourtney sees how it feels when her and Khole gained up on Kim before
That’s the problem as a mother when you see another sibling attacking the other one and you just been ignoring it or just didn’t know from being so busy with work this and that .. she’s low key hurting inside...it’s 😞
Kim Libra IS naturally bully its naturally in them, sometime they didnt realize it.
You feel bad yet that part of the episode still got aired :/
Why are these people rich? Why does anyway gaf about them?  I want to see each of them unexpectedly pied in the face. Gooey, sloppy cherry pie. Then, a quick little face slap. 🖐
It's Kanye fault...smh
I mean this is so sick why would people hate Kourtney? Just becaus she doesn't allow her kids to have sugar doesn't mean she is bad and btw thats her opinion and decision.
Aw Kris 🥺🥺🥺
Ai gente traduz pro português os fofoqueiros do Brasil agradecem
I thought she had a gun in her hand in the thumbnail lmao
Khloe talking about being valued and loved. Girl, you wouldn’t know the meaning of all that if you didn’t go back to your ex. Girl bye
I'll be so glad when dogshit TV like this is over
Kris your face is pulled so tight..I'm surprised you can cry at all
I love Kourtney as a mom and would prob as a friend type too. At first I did not like her and I still love Khloe but if I was the sister I would def leave my kid with Kourtney!!!! Her moral and values are very similar to what I would want my child to grow up with and in real life I am leaving my son for my sister who does not have kids and reminds me of my sissy. It is hard to get ganged up on I am a middle child and it happens sometimes you are not heard or feel like you are valued! I am glad Kris called her and said I am sorry because words hurt and she was ganged up on too.
That’s so weird khloe and kourt used to be so close
Always been Team Kourt🔥
Depression is real 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺 I'm going through it someday are tougher than others just keep going
this is sad, kris is sweet but im hoping that she could have the talk with kourt without any sister are hearing... but just maybe by this that khloe n kim can understand the things too..
Kourtney has been through ALOT.
You do realize this is television right? Kris is crying all the way to the bank. This is why we have a TV president

A Kourtney é a melhor das irmãs. Kin é muito negativa e se acha. Kourtney que Deus abençoe sua vida poderosamente e da sua família. 🙏🇧🇷
Thought she had a gun lol
Well this is finally getting over for Kourtney and the whole family
Please tell me the name of the music
Khloe looking hella fine on this clip!
Kris makes it too obvious that Kim is her favorite and over the years you can see how it has affected her and Kourtney's relationship. Regardless on whether or not you have a favorite, as a parent you need to anyways stay neutral and fair to all of your children. I hope their relationship gets better from here ❤❤
She is literally an amazing mother❤️.. She is alwways there for all her kids.
2020 was bad enough you had to cancel the only hope we had?
❤️🥺
you guys im not saying that I don't feel bad for Kourtney but when everyone was ganging up on Kim everyone all just laughed at her and made a meme about it we should realize how Kim also felt treat them the same
Kris will cry with Kourtney then with Kim also. It's called motherhood!  It's interesting to watch khlo's reaction to this
Ridiculous!
I cry everytime
I love you Kris & all your daughters..i am an avid fan eversince..God Bless your family!😍😍😍
💔🌷🌷
I really don’t understand them. Kourtney basically held this show together at the beginning, she showed the MOST out of all the siblings. Her whole relationship was broadcasted, their struggles, everything! It’s no wonder she wants a break. It’s not fair that they gang up on her when she was the one showing everything because Kim needed to maintain her princess status back then.  I love Kim too don’t get me wrong that’s just my observation
Kourt has always been my favorite Kardashian because she’s  the most relatable .  That fight was honestly when she reached her breaking point  because of how nasty Kim treated her .
Be praying for them family Kardashians thanks you let us be part of the family together let us open our home
I ve come, i ve seen and now I am leaving ::
Which one is OJs?
Kim is so mean when   she fights with her sister or with her brother. I watched all the episodes and When people said kourtney bullied Kim for years too  i don't see how. yes they were arguing but it wasn't often and it  wasn't so mean.
https://youtu.be/DGYJMm6uFSU
Kris n kourtney u guys😭😭
Kim has the right to leave. Kourtney isn’t innocent in this. They all had a part to play in this argument. Kourt should work on letting people in and not being rude and rubbing people the wrong way. Kim should work on understanding others and not blowing up in the middle of arguments
Wait so Kourtney can bully kim since season 1 be completely vile and nasty kim calls her out for not working but wanting to be paid and she’s a victim?!?! FOH!!!! Kourtney is toxic with no work ethic
Wow Khloe that was unexpected
Games over! Let's all hydrate and our own damn B!!
This is the Most Important post you will ever read;  Every one of us has broken God’s moral law, the Ten Commandments. We’ve all lied and we’ve all stolen, which makes us liars & thieves; And James 2 : 10 states that breaking even just one of these commandments makes us guilty of breaking them all.   The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because The Creator is perfect in holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in justice, meaning not a single sin will go unpunished; and our penalty for sin is death & hell, which the Bible describes as Eternal fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .  Fortunately God is also perfect in love, so 2000 years ago, Jesus Christ left his throne in heaven and came to this earth. Here, he lived a perfect & sinless life, only to take the punishment that we deserved; Our sinless creator became our sin, & endured a painful death on a cross for our sake. Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’.. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. On the third day, he conquered death & rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of Gods judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace;  Except a gift can either be accepted or rejected..So this is what you must do in response;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him, & through gratitude in the sacrifice of his son, repent (turn away) from your old ways. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, your savior, and the ruler of your life from this moment forward (Romans 10:9), and you will be saved .  The moment you do this, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds pleasure in sin, & also, he will grant you eternal life in his presence; Nothing on this earth even close to compares to what awaits believers in the afterlife.   You’ve been informed; now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you spend ETERNITY.. meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make. And all of us here, whether believer or atheist, know deep down that every last word here is true.  Jesus Christ is awaiting YOU right this very moment; don’t even think about sleeping tonight until you have surrendered to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed.. and as it is written  (Hebrews 9 : 27); ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’.  All glory, honor and praise to Lord Jesus Christ .  https://www.amazon.com/dp/1432117750/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_i_KttEFbESFBVEC
trashhhh bbs
I had two sisters pass away, I'd give anything to talk to or hug them again. The Kardashian/Jenner sisters seem to fight a lot! Get over it, before one of you are no longer on this earth.
Kim hates kourt. But at the end kourt always there when kim have problems with kanye. That’s what big sister do and care for their little sister
I thought she had a gun in the thumbnail
They are all mean brats
One doesn't own emotion, and when one is owned by emotion, it's a reflection of one's belief that one owns them♥️
Kim is lowkey still harbouring hate from that fight lol...especially with the way she got up and left the table 🤣...no wonder Rob barely makes appearances anymore. Once one family member is not doing what the others want or think they nitpick and that's not a great trait to have, a little narcissistic if you ask me. At least Kris showed some form of empathy to Kourt.
Why did they end the show? I haven't been keeping up with the Kardashian's anymore...did their viewership go way down?
In the thumbnail I thought Kris was holding a gun sooooo I thought this video was gonna go a lot differently than it did
It's more fun licking my finger after digging for feces then watching this
Khloe acting like she ain't hurt no one👀
*Don't u just wanna 🤜👩🏻 kim for acting like not caring*
That's so sad🙏😭😭😭
The Spongebob Apparition https://youtu.be/TAVDZzb4RpQ
that fight was funny
I feel they may own everything money can buy but they are quite unhappy.
Kim runs out...typical. They have all been ganging up on Kourtney for years. And now that the show will end, they will re-watch their shows and realize what many of us have already witnessed!  Kim is a fake and wants the continuous spot light, and Kourtney doesn't care about fame...It was stated before that only Kim and Kris wanted to start a reality show, and no-one else. SO, imagine how desperate Kim is for fame and popularity.
Bye bish...
khloes kinda mean
End the show!
Weird that it takes her having to rewatch the episode to see what they were doing to kourtney
If you want to be saved and have everlasting life believe Jesus died on the cross for our sins, and was buried. Then, rose on the third day, which proved He is truly our God and Savior. John 3:16 “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”
horrible mother at its best ,if think otherwise is because you are a child a stupid 1 at best
Why Kim got up and left kinda gave me the vibe that she's the one causing most of the conflict that's going on? That's just MY VIBE...
I thought Kris had a gun in the thumbnail lmao 😂😂
Damn I wish i had a mother like Kris
It's amazing that positive shows can get CANCELLED immediately, but negative shows will stay on for a long time.  We are truly living in a BACKWARDS world.  The entire system is RIGGED.
I love Kris and Kourtney...
I really feel for kourtney. First she gets a partner who is a spineless loser. He never loved her and stayed there only for cameras and then her own sisters bullied, humiliated and insulted her for basically no reason. In fact they supported cheater scott more than kourtney! She really has been through hell. Hope she is in better place now!
comeuppance gamps
Isn’t it CRAZY that ADDISON RAE knows these people!!!
I am so sick and tired of hearing that this show is ending, yet we still can't get rid of them for good.  Enough is enough already!
3rd Impostor Among Us Mask‼️‼️‼️‼️ When you play with 2 impostors, but there's always that one crewmate that messes up the game 😂 https://www.redbubble.com/i/mask/3rd-Impostor-Among-Us-by-Rozz-Designs/59452377.9G0D8?asc=u
Everyone is fully clothed  Oh, then the confession🙄
😢
Khloe during the call: 👁👄👁 chile- me: what fight bro-
Khloe sitting there like: S*** I messed up
PLEASE! ffs cancel this trash!!!.. How can anyone actually say this is a good show?  Every second I've watched i could legitimately feel my brain cells dying.
Literally 99% won’t see this but if you do, God bless you, stay safe and have a wonderful day read my name 🙏🙏
Literally 99% won’t see this but if you do, God bless you, stay safe and have a wonderful day read my name 🙏🙏
Hey don't cry
It's very obvious that Kourt is going through something and she just wants the support of her family 💕
God do u see how much they ACT! Always professional always made up even when their bringing up issues ...how sad n dysfunctional
I love how they are all understanding with each other
Kris is always so fuckin high lmao
I know yall didn't have the same energy when it was kourtney and khloe ganging up on Kim a few years ago. Yall laughed and that's just hypocritical. I'm probably the only person who doesn't feel sorry for kourt🤷🏽‍♀️
Remember when they all shunned Rob through his depression
Kourtney is the oldest people don’t understand how much we have to endure lol because we Love HARD
How can I watch this episode?
I get you Kourtney, a real one. Aries.
Lmao
Ojalá pudieran poner esto traducido en español
ilove kris jenner so much
Watching 2 sister gang up and bully the eldest sister is toxic , No wonder kourtney need a few new friend in her life .
Is this season 19 because I haven’t seen it I’ve only seen the seasons on Hulu and I’m waiting for season 19
We can all agree that kris is the perfect mom for them
I feel sad😢
I really hope thats a reusable straw
This brake my heart so much!!   😞
Initially I wished Kim hit kourtney even more but after watching this and how Kim walked out and kris finally reaching out, I'm glad she got Kim real good.
That “Thank you” from Kourtney just really hits hard. The pain and forgiveness in it is just unbearable to me.
People always attack kourt but if she left the kuwtk it would not be a good show. It would be boring,sad,and not Interiesting, also it wouldn't even be a thing if it weren't for kourt.
I love you Kourtney 💖💖💖
I feel for Kourtney. Like people forget she was the one making content for the show in the beginning seasons. And kinda disappointed by Khloe.
Was always team Kourtney
Check me out
Est que Chloé est enceinte ?
This made me laugh because KRIS JENNER staged all of this 😂
0:18 I don't owe anybody anything now because of, *p  a  i  d t o b e h o m e .c o m*
:j love this!
Kris is always crying omgg
Imagine actually wiping ur tears with a napkin and not just smearing your hands all over your face
WoW mom just realized that!! I noticed that since I saw how she was beaten by his own fam member
Kourtneys “thank you, I’m fine, I’m fine now” was said with SO much emotion. It made me cry
I really wish kourtney happiness, true happiness. She really does deserves it! Most authentic one out of all of them.
Anyone else think Kris was holding a gun in this thumbnail? 😂
I thought that they were going to stop doing the show
It was so sad to see them fight that way but also I think they all need to take responsibility for their actions, including Kourtney, otherwise they will never get to a place where all is right with them completely. Kim and Khloe need to give her space when she asks for it but Kourtney also needs to respect back their feelings about what and how they do things. That is what the problem is at the end of the day is they all think they are in the right and don’t listen to each other and it blows up into this huge mess! Glad to see how they show they are working on their issues and relationships such great role modelling ❤️🌈❤️🌈❤️
Finally 🥰🥰
I looked @ the thumbnail like Kris really got a glock in her hand 😭😭😭
I love you all.
Im not gonna lie, I thought the thumbnail was kris pointing a gun at khloe. Lol I had to do a double take.
I don't know the reason, but when I hear Kourtney cry it just breaks my heart.
I’m the Kourtney in my cousin group, but now I’m the Kim Kardashian  and fight back
everyone taking kourts side did not watch the past 2 seasons lol kourtney is 100% responsible for the way they treat her
This is emotional. You can feel her emotion running through, and of course it feels good that her own mom comforted her.
I love Kourt so much and hearing her crying on the phone got me so emotional.
I think that Kourtney has been bullied by Kim and Khloe for long enough.  Good on her for standing  up to Kim.  Enough is enough already.
This gets really hard to watch everytime
kourtney put kim in that position for years for no reason why does she keep forgetting that. and no one ganged up on her for no reason shes been really unbearable and uncooperative
Y’all feel bad for kourtney as if she doesn’t do the same thing to everyone else in her family
Khloe looks so uncomfortable during that phone call

They should call this episode the beginning of the end of the Kardashian’s because it all coming to the end
I literally cried watching this
What happened
Imagine she took miami, nyc and hamptons plus 19 seasons of KUWTK. Cmon! Give her a break. I felt the love of kris for her first born. Love them all!
Damn khloes make up looks soooo gooood
Que le paso a Kourt ?
Y'all saw the gun in the thumbnail too right?💀
My sisters and I fight but never end up on no talking terms. I love my sisters too much to not even be able to talk to them.
You can tell the bond they used to have is lost. The more the money and fame came into the picture its almost like they werent the same family anymore. I think Kourtney also misses her dad which is probably why she acts guarded and so distant. People judged her so much without knowing her true pain and sadness.
0:33 that thank you made me wheeeeppppp !!!
awwww I love kris best mom she got all her kids
Wait what are they talking about
Finally kris cares about kourtney
My God so much of fake tan and shimmers on Khloe :(
Aaaawww this makes me sad
Every time Kris cries..wanda cries
I always felt bad for kourt but I feel like now they understand I love place ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
They treat Courtney like nothing
Is Kim even apologised about what happen? I feel like she doesn’t care
wow I will miss you guys
I honestly cried while watching this. that when my mom came back home from a party she asked me why I was crying. I had to pretend that I drank hot sauce
Where can I get the full one
It's kourtney fought o well bye
bottomline and actually a fact that they should thank kourtney for everything bc guuuuurl she is the most relevant and iconic star of the whole show from the very start.
Khloe looks so beautiful  here
This got me in tears 💔
On a real serious note if there’s something Kourtney needs is therapy. She has had this false mindset that the whole world is against her, yet she fails to see where she’s wrong. It’s common at times to feel like you’re the one being attacked but I mean over 2 years? There really is a reason for everything. If everyone has come together to point out her wrongs then the problem isn’t just everyone else. The problem is Kourtney’s mindset, but no one can help her see that but herself. I also understand that the sisters did wrong in the way they responded or treated her. However how did the feel after those two years of someone having the same mindset? It’s not as if they had to be obligated to treat someone so good after all they got was mostly negativity and for no reason.
Just remember Kim's a meme
aww this is so so soooo sad 😭
Lol they gang up on Kourtney for wanting a break and now they are canceling the show.. lol 😆
Wow
What happened
Nooo kourt and kris made me cry 😭😭
Kris looks like she's holding a gun to Khloe's head in the thumbnail
Kim only cares about money. Period. She married Kanye and he turned her into this soulless doll.
What episode is this??
Aww Kris ❤️
Kylie o pisi pisi fel kris o pisi pisi fel kim o pisi pisi fel anlasın
I’m surprised Kourtney cried when her mom telling her if she needed to talk. Kourtney usually blows people off. It’s come to a breaking point and Kourtney knows it
00:33 don’t tell me you didn’t feel that 😭
Kourt wasn’t wrong at all!
That’s what’s a loving mother does! ❤️
Its all kholes fall
Kim is very bad person that is why her husband gone mad just cuz she think kourtney doesn't do anything so she says worst things to her but remember that kourtney deserved more respect in family besides kim love money and her self
When Kourtney decided to step back from the show to spend more time with her children everybody criticized her but the fact that they decided to end the show now proofs that Kourtney was right! The show was bigger than the family.
Khloeeeeee and Kim were visibly monstrous to Kourtney for years - CALLING KOURTNEY BORING, WHEN IN FACT, THE SHOW WOULD BE SO MUCH LESS WITHOUT HER AND SCOTT!!! ...such monstrous abuse.
I feel sad for kourtney
No one cares. Get off media now
I love you KOURTNEY 💋💋💜💜
Why did Kim leave? She should have stay & heard the pain in her sister’s voice
I wonder how they cry so easy
Khloe and Kourtney had always ganged up on Kim but now it's the other way around, Kourtney can't handle it.
Khloe and Kourtney had always ganged up on Kim but now it's the other way around, Kourtney can't handle it.
Kourtney deserves to be understood. I'm glad she is happier now.
Wow drama never ends
When Kloe talks when she's by herself, it looks like different pieces of people were used from the waist up; I don't think the shoulders and arms are hers.
Kourtney’s voice broke my heart 🥺 she shouldn’t have to go through this
I am LITERLLY crying 19 seasons I am sad for these ending days, what a journey!
Its the photoshopped original outfit! I'm glad she looks human in real life.
Family is family they fight it’s normal I’m glad kris said if want to talk I’m here
Worst day ever
They should be ashamed of how they treated her when she has put the most of her life on this show more then any of them. She made the damn show her relationship with scott was the center of this show from season 1. She carried the show. And they were so self absorbed with being famous they couldnt even see that she was suffering and struggling. The breakup with scott was to much for her the fact that all she ever wanted was for him to be better, but then he go and be the boyfriend she wanted for sofia a damn child. Thats when her issues started. Its sad that they refused to see it instead they kept bullying, judging and attacking her. They lost a lot of viewers because of that fight, how she was treated and being bullied and the fact that she left. The show is unbearable to watch especially khloe who use to be a fan fav... she is always lying or changing up stories to b more dramatic. Fame defs got to her head trying to be like kim. Its sad. Im glad Kourt is free from this show and that they decided to end the show.
That episode really made me feel bad. I think its better to stop filming the show before it gets worse. See how Kim just walked off......
I think this is part of the reason why they decided to end the show. I predict that maybe some of them like Kim might start their own shows, but KUWTK was stressful in that the whole family had to be a part of it yet they're all in different places in their lives
She's such a good mom awww ❤
Khloe is really pretty in person , she doesn’t need to keep face tuning her face
Lowkey, the cover of this video makes it look like kris is holding a gun. And people, THEY DON'T UKNWOLEDGE YOU. Stop fighting in the comments.
I feel so bad for Kourt she’s clearly matured and is on a different vibe to her sisters.
Does anybody not remember back in previous seasons when  kourtney and khloe used to gang up on Kim  if kourtney can dish it she needs to be able to take it as well
I'm crying cause I'm gonna miss this show 😰😰
This family is a joke
Kourtney deserve to be happy
I know ppl feel that kris does favouritism. N yes yah she is very money minded apparently. But u cannot deny the fact that whatever karjenner sis are today billionaire,  top model, Businesswomen, Influencer its just bcz kris worked hard to put them together n made KUWK a succesful show.Without her kardashians would nt be kardashians
I like kourtney and you have to not deal with family sometimes
Why am I crying too?
where can i watch the whole series
I can't stand Khloe's new face and nose
Why is KIM WALKING OUT ?
kim just running away the second she realizes kris is calling kourtney...
KUWTK WAS KOURTNEY'S JOURNEY PERIOD!
I think Chloe needs to chill
That was hard to watch.  I can relate to Kourtney's frustration and the difficulties she was having with her break-ups and child rearing and work.  Unfortunately, Kim was right in her comments that episode and Kourtney behaved like her daughter scratching people.  Very inappropriate and sad, but I think they're all in a better place today.  Sibling's love and hate.
Always dramaaa!!!
Yo when Kourtney cries I feel it to my core. The others  nothing but Kourtney .........
what fight ?
aw this made me tear up too
Woah not late.
When’s Kourtney voice broke. Omggg the tears are coming 🥺🥺💔
I feel so sorry for kourtney and kris
Which fight?
Kourtney has always been about her family.  She wasn’t selfish, she doesn’t want all the attention.  And always roots for her sisters.
I feel Kourt. Sometimes I feel like everyone hates me and ask myself am I that bad person they described? And I literally cry like Kourtney when person understand my situation and comfort me
Awww I’m jealous x
People in the comments defending Kourtney as if she's not the one who starts all of the drama is comical.
This is how Kim pushed Rob too. Slap well deserved.
This entire family is toxic. Im glad the show is ending. Let them remember what's more important in life than fame- family.
When I hear kourtney and Kris talking it melts my heart it's show even the strongest people  need a reminder sometimes that someone care
I just hate Khloes face and Kims
See? Kris gets it...We all saw it...They all ganged up on her...
I thought Kris was holding a gun in the thumbnail
https://youtu.be/OsFVUWwZMOY wow new 2pm c
THE love YOU all HAVE FOR each OTHER
Not everyone wants to live life in the spotlight for so long. Kourtney and her Scott drama were the most interesting part of Keeping Up at one point. Why should Kourtney keep showing her life to people who don't care about her, and only want to see drama? That's not the meaning of life. That episode really made me see Kim in a negative way.
aw :( <3
It’s sad how they broke kourtney. And it seems they have no remorse for how they gained up on kourt! Especially khloe..
I would have been fine with Kourtney no longer being on the show.
Anyone who thinks Kris is a great mom must have had a worse mom then mine? She is a horror for a mom her kids didn’t rise up and call her blessed and she pimped them out and has favorites. Rob would be her fav but he ran off like sons do cause he saw she was cray cray and gonna ruin his life?
Oh Khloe shut up. Go and fight with Tristan loser
I feel for Kourtney, but if anything after everything she’s gone through she should feel more empathetic towards Kendall who has expressed that she feels different from the fam and feels left out. She didn’t do that on the outfit issue with Kylie and Kendall, she just let it happen, she had the power to easily give it to the first reservation which was a Kendall.
I crying 😭😞🙁☹️😓
This is such a wholesome moment like i'm literally crying with them.
Kourtney is the oldest, but Kim is the boss, and that can make for a contentious relationship amongst  sisters. It's clear that Khloe airs on the side with Kim all the time because Kim started that bank roll...
Look at Khloe shifting in her seat and pulling at her turtleneck 0:45 lmao. Guilty!!
I'm not crying...I promise😭
There is no greater than the love of a mother <3
I feel so sad for kourtney and I truly mean it I am the eldest and I can feel that parents favoures younger siblings which is so sad
Look at Khloe shifting in her seat like the guilty, shady B that she is. And Kim straight up leaves the room. We see who the toxic kardashians are.
kourtney said i feel so much better.... yeah because you had your temper tantrum
Tbh from kims body language it looks like she stepped away so she could cry about it too
All they do is Fight!! It’s honestly disturbing to the level they take it! I stopped watching a long time ago! I wish them best as they move forward not doing the show anymore!
Did anyone else think Kris was holding a gun in the thumbnail? 😂 or am I just losing it?
kourtney is the best kardashian member and i love her so much 😍😍😍
Of course Kim leaves, belittling your own sister because her priorities are different from yours like being a mom outweighing fame is something a narcissist doesn’t want to hear
Kim is lowkey still harbouring hate from that fight lol...especially with the way she got up and left the table 🤣...no wonder Rob barely makes appearances anymore. Once one family member is not doing what the others want or think they nitpick and that's not a great trait to have, a little narcissistic if you ask me. At least Kris showed some form of empathy to Kourt.
Wait which fight are they talking about?
I love Kardashians ❤so much
One things clear Kris is a great mom and she knows which side to take exactly in a situation.
Once kourt  left the show i  stopped  watching  too. Nothing  hurts in this world like not being  appreciated  by yr  own  people..I love you mum p
i ain't gonna lie.when kourtney said "thank you.." with that sound from her voice. it almost made me cry.
Kris is just a wonderful mother...
They be crying for everything lol
Team Kourtney ☁️😍alwayssss
Yk I relate to Kourt so much in a way.
KRIS YOU TREATED KIM LIKE SHE WAS RUNNING THE SHOW AND YOU LET KIM BULLY ROB AND THEN YOU ALLOW KIM AND KHLOE TO BULLY AND PUT DOWN KOURT YOU NEVER STOOD UP FOR HER AND LOOK AT KARMA ...THE SHOW IS CANCELLED IM SO GLAD PROVES THAT KOURT WAS NOT THE LEAST TO LOOK AT BUT KIM WAS WITH HER IM THE BOSS ADDITUDE
Omg Kris is the best mom . and anyway at the end of it all, they r family and they r sooo strong . through every battle , blood is thicker than water💯💯
Not khloe acting all innocent when majority of the drama happened with Kourtney was literally started by her. Whenever kim and Kourtney fight, khloe has this annoying smirk on her face and immediately blame it on Kourtney.. Even during that fight, she literally went on Kourtney saying its her fault. I think they need to realize that Kourtney gave her all for the show..she gave her relationship with scott, her pregnancy, her labor (literally had crew in OT with her). Her mental health and her relationship with scott went down the drain for the show and now they all calling her out for doing bare minimum. She literally carried old 4-5 seasons on her own
That thank you made me cry
I just unfollowed Khloe. She doesn't deserve Kourtney. Punto finale.
Come on...finish this bulshit drama...
That made me cry poor Kourt
Aweee kourt..we r with u  ❤❤❤❤❤❤
Wow I almost cried this is so sad that they’ve got this bad vs season 1 they used to be so close !
Is there really anyone who believes in all these glicerine tears for sale?
I feel for kourtney🥺🥺
My god help me to leave morocco it becomes hell and hamada juif with canadian who made mafias on me here in.morocco plz sandy if you hear me help me take me from mafia morocco plz plz plz hamada is virus and old mafia king sent him.to me to steal me in my money
Awwww  kris is just such an amazing mom!!! God bless them!!!
Everyone is so quick to judge them, even me. But they are human.
Which season is that? 19 or 20
I thought Kris was holding a gun 🙈🙈
They was all dead wrong in the Kourtney situation. They were straight up bullying her  & and for nothing cause a couple year later they all quit the show. Like makes no sense.
Kim started that fight by ganging up on Kourtney and then played the victim to Khloe, Kourtney's ex, their mom, and everyone else. It's about time someone reached out to Kourtney.
Kourtney ❤️❤️❤️
Khloe kim ganged up on kourtney.  No wonder why she didn't want to be around u guys.  It's not a nice way to treat anyone.  You and kim always taking each other side.  Making kourtney left out or insecur.  Not nice
Stop blaming kourtney.  You and kim were ganging up on her. Therefore she didnt want to be part with anyone.
Kim just leaves...
KOURTNEY HAS WORKED EVERY SEASON!! Every spinoff!! Why was she attacked for wanting a break! Enough is enough!
Look st the two devil together Khloe and kim.  Khloe is one fake.
Why am I crying, I hate to see people cry
Why are they crying??? Lmaoooo
About time!
Stay Strong XOXO ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I just hate them when they started attacking Kourtney
Kourtney is ICONIC PERIOOODT
Now kourtney what rob went thru with them.
Maybe Kourtney is too fed up of there family that she wants to hang out with new plp
HEEEEY! I hope everyone is having a great day!😁 if anyone here supports LGBTQ you should checkout our channel🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈
After years of seeing that kris only caring about kim and kylie, this is emotional for everyone
This season is terrible like everything seems staged and super slow..., no storyline and lackluster
I wish happiness for Kourteny
I seriously love Kourt ❤️ Scott go spent some time with her 😑   Love From India 🇮🇳🇮🇳
It shouldn't take seeing an episode about your daughters fighting for you to acknowledge that something was/is wrong with one of your children to the point where they feel ganged up on. It shouldn't had taken this long Kris for that phone call.
Shut up Kourtney
Ugh .. Kourtney was clearly going through stuff but she was being defensive and not being a great communicator .. let’s own our actions search and dig deep and move forward and try and be better than yesterday ..
To hear kourtney say "thank you." And then cries, makes me feel so relieve for her as she must of felt so alone. And to see she is so happy now, makes me happy for her even more. 💗💗
for kris to apologize to kourt proves that everyone ganging up against her was completely unnecessary.. all she wanted to do was be more present in her children’s lives and you can never be angry at someone for that. i love kourtney... she is literally so hilarious. i wish her all the best <3
Omg 🥺 i got goosebumps when kourtney started crying because it was like she finally felt like she was heard. I feel that..
I just love the Kardashians and Jenner's
why did kim leave?!
Im happy Kris handled this as their mom and not their manager
The fight was bad it’s really sad I blame kim something bothering her.
this show was starting to destroy their relationships...good for them for calling quits on it
Khloe is just a puppy to Tristan and kim.. that's her life. Whatever it is I am happy for true she us getting love from both of her parents and sad for Tristan's other child
I actually got a lil emotional hearing Kourtney cry about it because I can relate to it.
Very difficult to see Kris in tears .. i feel the pain  Love&light girls x
This video gets me sooooo angry. When they ganged up on Kim in the first few seasons. Kourtney didn’t give af!!! She enjoyed it. and she  started the problem usually. She admitted it in last season. She created all that fights they do. Now since it’s finally her she gets it. She had to go through this. To see how she made her sisters feel in the past. Stop playing the victim when you started this whole problem from the beginning (like and comment if you agree)
This show destroyed the family bond and that is a sacrifice you make. It’s going to take years to build it again.
I thought kris was holding a gun in the thumbnail lmao
But didn't Kourt bully Kim for years. She's never acknowledged that or apologised. So getting a taste of the medicine and she feels attacked
Kris is such a Scorpio lol😍
We love you kourtney❤️✨
Don't forget the Love you have for each other, thats what make you guys so different.  That beautiful union, you guys have..💓💕
Khloe Kardashian she is holding her tears
kim literally walked out 0:10
Omg i didn’t know kourtney was so hurt to, Omg i’m crying🥺
Kourtney has been my all time favorite person. We need to admit sometimes our own family takes years to understand our value.
I like Kourtney but she always said she wanted to quit the show but she always come back like in this season.
Kourtney has a nice side.... we just don’t see it ...I don’t think we saw everyone in all spectrums but Kendall and Kylie
You can see how the ‘show’ destroyed Kourtney in all ways. But don’t forget that Kim was also ganged upon by Kourtney and Khloe in the first few seasons which she got through
I’m over here crying like they’re my sisters. 😆 😭
Kris and Kourtney have the weirdest relationship
Okay now this made me feel emotional 🥺
I thought Kris had a gun in the thumbnail
Kris isn’t a horrible mother, but she sometimes to me doesn’t seem like she knows what’s going on all the time. And I get their grown women, but she always seems maybe like she’s too busy, or coming in at the last minute whenever the siblings have these arguments. Either way I think the show ending is actually good for them. To reconnect to each other WITHOUT cameras and hopefully get back to what’s real. Cause it’s just sad at this point.
Khloe needs to get a new stylist
They were equally annoying in that situation. It was Khloe that blew me lol all in the room with Kourt questioning her after the fight like stfu lol
It’s a good thing they are ending the show, it’s not good seeing them arguing all the time
I like Kim but I hate the fact that drifted herself out as soon as she came to know that kourtney is being called. Grow up sis
i feel like im gonna die 😭 i dont feel fine but then this show up in my recommendation and now i have anxiety attack also i dont want kuwtk to end!!! 😭 oh god
I wanna make a joke to change the atmosphere but this is serious that I can’t even make a joke about anything...🥺💔
Kourtney IS the show!!!
Without kourtney there would be no KUWTK period she was the storyline in the beginning.
Holy shit...i thought kris was holding a gun on khloe.....
I miss them and that broke my heart
Love them allll ❤️❤️ sad to know that they ended the show but I’m happy for them because it was time
Not Kim Leaving 😭😭😭😭
I understand how kris is feeling becoz I've felt that before when my mom blamed my brother for something he didnt do So.....
Aw so sweet 💓 made me cry ..the love for her daughter's.the understanding she has ..so amazing .xo
This family always got each other's back👩‍👧
Kourtney is the most normal one in the family and I hate when they just bully Kourtney.
i wish my mom was like that😭 theyre so lucky
Kim walking out as soon as she heard Kourtney on the phone says alot !
QUEEN KIM 🤭🤭😂
What episode is this
Love kuwtk
This YouTube channel better forever 😏 💖
dont worry kris its okay
i felt so bad for kourt when i watched the episode
I’m glad this shows getting cancelled cause the fact they went that far just cause she didn’t wana shoot anymore like wtf?
nd mybe  hlp me in smething
hy  kadarshians  dnt be lke tht
If you are a parent and you watch this and see this I’m asking you to look into your house and make sure no one ever feels like kourt
What hurts me the most...that how Kim just ignore and gone.....like 0% guilt or sympathy Who was there for her first pregnancy for the whole time while kris was busy helping Kylie...she don't even remembered her due date....it was kourt who was there for her supported her guided her.
awn this is so sad but also so good to see them showing love to each other in the end of the day 💕💕😩
Kris is such a supportive mum. I feel bad for Kourtney because she does get a lot of hate for wanting privacy. But is that really so wrong? Everything about her life has been on camera so it isn’t really so bad to want to have something to yourself.
Idk why but this time i don't really like Kim
:(
im early!?!?! ilove u khole UwU
it's sad that this show is going to end
Stop fighting you all but drama is good for views tho honestly
Khloe has no business being soo beautiful
I can't believe that they are not going to be on the air anymore 😕  I'm so extremely sad 😥
Remember on Jimmy Fallon Kim said when Kris saw a clip of the fight she cried? She was telling the truth.
Finally, I feel happy 😣 I wish to get the old Khloe and Kourtney back 💓
what fight is it? anyone who remembers?
What episode are they talking about
I'm not gonna sit here and be childish and act like my eyes didn't start welling up when Kourtney said "thank you.." with a broken voice 😭😭 really pulled my heartstrings man ❤️
Kourtney got up and hit Kim first... But It really does suck that this happened, but they are siblings and it happens, they will move past it.
This is touching🥺 Mom always loves you♥
But it was ok when kourtney n Khloe gang up against Kim during younger years..
Omg yass
People never give Kourtney the credit she deserves she literally was the main story line for the beginning of the show. Kris is so amazing 💕💕
I feel bad for Kourtney. But for everyone else saying Kim was the one at fault, it just isn't fair. Both of them should be held accountable for what happened. Kourtney is no angel. & so is Kim nor Khloe.
The KARDASHIAN family is the BEST family❤️❤️❤️❤️
I hope they all rekindle their relationship with each other specially Kourt &Kim..Kourtney is a great person I just don't get it why they picks on her specially kim.
early squaddddd
Hi so glad you guys worked everything out ❤️ your such a close family happy everyone is getting along much better
I'm gonna miss them so baaad ❤❤ love from Germany ❤🇩🇪
🥺😟😢💗
what I upload on my YouTube channel: - remixes of One Direction's songs - Q&A session and bloopers/behind the scenes footage - vine-like videos
This is EXACTLY why they needed to stop the show. They forgot to listen to each other. When your family is miserable and needs help; they need your support more than anything. The pressure to be number 1 and perfect all the time is unrealistic. Not just for famous people but for any human being. Kris really showed how a Mother should react in a time of reflection. Great job, Kris. 👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿💗
I love the vulnerability.
❤❤❤
Hi guys what's up
I love how Kris support her daughter and understand their felling
Noooo pls🥺🥺🥺🥺😭😭😭😢 i will miss kim kardashian west pls no
I just don’t like it when everyone attacks Kourt, She’s innocent. Kris is the best mom so amazing 🤩
To be honest I like kourt..❤
Hi 5 minutes
I'll miss this for suree
Quien más habla español pero lo ve porque las adora demasiado💖💖💖💖
Maybe Kourtney is too fed up of there family that she wants to hang out with new plp
I'm not crying you are
My heart melts when Kourtney starts crying and saying thank you. Kris has always favoured Kim, so I think Kourtney is really happy that her mom favoured her.She deserves a lots of love🖤
2 min ago also im rewatching the show im on S3

I saw the thumbnail and was like; " why tf is Kris holding a gun "
I love he drama tho-
I can't tolorate the fact that its ending 😥😥
😍😍
But it was literally kims fault and everyone blames poor kourt 😭
I feel like Kris has always favoured Kim and for her to not be on Kim's side in that fight shows she really feels for Kourtney. I love that. I hope Kourtney's happy.
i’m so sad
Everyone gives Kourtney hate like she’s so funny
